[09:14] <patrickb> ping lizmat: Did you see my above message? (I am able to change permissions myself, but wanted to get feedback on the change first.)

[09:16] <patrickb> Also, in general, who are the interested parties in cro at the moment? I.e. who do I need to consult for anything Cro? I kind of feel in charge, but no idea if I am...

[13:11] <lizmat> patrickb: afaics you are in control now  :-)

[13:12] <lizmat> re permissions: not sure whether there was any thought given to it

[13:30] <patrickb> Cool. Then I'll feel more free to actually take decisions. Thanks for the heads up.

[13:33] <lizmat> you're very much welcome, applying forgiveness is easier  :-)

[13:33] <lizmat> and empowering people is good  :-)

[16:58] <coleman> I still don't have auto deploy, but the cro website runs off of this container image https://quay.io/repository/chroot.club/cro-website  and it is built from this Dockerfile https://github.com/Raku/cro-website/blob/main/Dockerfile ; Any changes I can deploy in short order.

[16:59] <coleman> The container build needs to be optimized. It's too slow as a single-stage (note to self).
