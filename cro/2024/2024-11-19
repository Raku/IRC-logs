[15:14] <patrickb> Can we add the discord bridge to this channel? Who has permissions to do so?

[15:17] <lizmat> I think this is the wrong channel to ask  :-)

[15:17] * lizmat lost track of who runs the discord bridge

[15:17] <patrickb> Wait... Does it even work this way? isn't the discord bot showing up all on it's own when a discord user wants to join?

[15:19] <patrickb> Hm. seems not so, given it's called discord-raku-bot

[15:19] <lizmat> yup, just like Geth, it's just a bot running somewhere by someone

[21:57] <patrickb> I've now bitten the bullet and started merging PRs with out a formal review that are either obvious (like bumping the minimum raku version in the CI setup to get the CI working again) or where a conversation on the PR did happen and all brought up issues were resolved.

[22:24] <patrickb> lizmat: Currently people that are added as members to the cro developers team in GH gain mostly no additional permissions. Is there a reason for this? It is possible to give members write access by default. To me that seems like the sensible thing to do. What do you think?
