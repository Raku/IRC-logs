[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I have taken the liberty of writing a protoype HTML::Component::CroTmp prototype that use the current version of Cro WebApp - please do feel free to try it and get a feel for what can sit in a class and why the route block is used with an instance etc.  https://gist.github.com/librasteve/3f435bc07131bb166a22f61b72af8389

[18:05] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> comments / feedback are very welcome here

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> there are quite a lot of constraints from the way that the repository gets precompiled so I have chosen to go the "write template to disk when the route is consumed" to maintain consistency.  this proto only covers the scope of HTML (not CSS / JS) which I would like to also have in a component setting so. My original larger scheme hoped to marry HTML components ("islands") and to use crotmp ... but based on this

[18:11] <discord-raku-bot> prototype, I am now feeling that crotmp is not really compatible with the idea of islands.

[18:11] <SmokeMachine> I’ve been playing with an idea extremely similar but completely different. I’m far from my computer now, when I’m back home, I’ll commit it to let you see that… it’s using your template-inline… but it adds the components as sub on every template… I’m still trying to find a better way to integrate format and the data… I’ll let you know when o commit it…

[18:12] *** Pe_Elle left
[18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yeah - I think that template-inline could work ... this proto was assuming "I wanna do something dynamic with my component, so its base tamplate would have some subs and then there would be an action crotmp to cal the subs... which by then have to be in the repo.

[18:14] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> anyway, please do share

[20:45] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: here it is: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/cromponent.raku

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> tx

[20:46] <SmokeMachine> if you clone that and use your fork from cro template it should work...

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ok

[20:46] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> will take a look thanks!!

[20:46] <SmokeMachine> here are the guts: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/lib/Cromponent.rakumod

[20:47] <SmokeMachine> it's not pretty... `template-with-components` adds the componets' subs every time...

[20:50] <SmokeMachine> and I gm still trying to find a way to not neet to call the sub AND pass the object (like on: `<&Todo($todo)>`) but I still have no idea... I'll maybe try to take a look how Form is implemented to see if that could help...
