[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: just wanted to give you a heads' up that I did include some cromponent code in my demo (tomorrow's advent post) - the code I made just finished today (and it was done in a hurry as the original date was 21st) here https://github.com/librasteve/raku-Cro-Website-Basic/tree/02-sharc1 (not main branch). This is about halfway to an MVP - I need to put in Red (ie data model inside the component), merge in

[15:35] <discord-raku-bot> your latest Cromponent updates and fix some things I broke and distinguish between installable libraries and site specific libraries... but I thnk that the sample site is pretty much in the form of my idea of how to build a website (which may be very different to your idea ?!)

[15:35] *** kawaii joined
[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> It would suit me to have Cromponent be an external module dependency - better than duplicating the code - but I see that you have not been able to be as active on the Cromponent prototype recently so I am happy to keep that code within these site level examples for now, but with the idea that I would maybe release and support as a raku module. Please can you give me an idea of your thoughts for this? When Cromponent

[15:41] <discord-raku-bot> does become a module in its own right, then I would probably break out the library of crompoments to also be external dependencies - maybe one for HTMX examples and one for Pico CSS examples.

[15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> PS. maybe a module name like HTML::Components or Cro::WebApp::Components would be better than Cromponents?[yeah I like that Cromponents is funny ... but the rest of the Cro naming is quite straight-laced ...]

[18:52] <lizmat> colloquially cromponents could continue to be used   :-)

[18:56] <discord-raku-bot> <scullucs> "Cromponents" sounds perfectly cromulent.

[19:39] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: Hi! So would it help you if I released what we have now?

[19:42] <SmokeMachine> I wouldn't say `the rest of the Cro naming is quite straight-laced`, once its name came from `my Cro $service` (at least that's what I remember). I'm not a big fan of straight-laced names...

[19:43] <SmokeMachine> it have no tests yet, but if it will help you, I can release it now...

[19:44] <SmokeMachine> ans sorry for not being very active the last days... I'm working too much...

[20:28] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: can you see if this helps you? https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/pull/6

[22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> your module - your name :-)

[22:10] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please do release what you wrote as early experimental - that would be very helpful

[22:11] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> i can try and write some tests and PR if you like

[22:33] *** Pe_Elle joined
[22:47] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> oh - we do need to work out the “reentrency” issue i posted please

[22:48] <SmokeMachine> have you tried that with this new version?

[22:49] <SmokeMachine> I don't see why that would break and I could't reproduce..

[22:54] *** sena_kun left
[22:55] <SmokeMachine> it's released... let's see if it will go to raku.land...

[23:00] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: you need your version of cro webapp to make that work...

[23:07] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I tried with the old version… will merge and close issue if fixed

[23:08] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> &afk

[23:08] <SmokeMachine> If that’s not fixed, if you could share a code to reproduce the error, I can try to fix
