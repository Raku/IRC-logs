[13:18] <jnthn> Hi folks. Some news about Cro: https://cro.services/community-transfer TL;DR after Edument has funded Cro development for a number of years, we're no longer in a position to do it, or to really be good project stewards, and so are organizing a transfer of it to the Raku community.

[13:19] <jnthn> Also, for those using Comma, I'm afraid there's also some less than good news there. https://commaide.com/discontinued :(

[14:11] <japhb> Thank you jnthn for all the work you and your team have put into Cro and Comma over the years, thank you for the detailed and frank history the above hosts, and thank you for allowing the Raku Steering Council and Raku community at large to take over stewardship of these projects.

[14:11] <japhb> *in the above posts

[16:05] <patrickb> Indeed. Thanks for all the work put into this over the years. And thanks for doing a hand over now. I see this as taking your responsibility seriously.

[16:54] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: patrickbkr++ created pull request #193: Fix HTTP2 connections with multiple streams stalling

[16:54] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/193

[17:24] <patrickb> Thinking about the effects of the issue of the above PR, I can imagine that to cause "dead" TCP connections to pile up. Maybe I'm finally done... We'll see.
