[12:45] <patrickb> We need to clarify the responsibilities for the Cro project. Currently I among a few others have a commit bit, but I think we need to clarify who is willing to take ownership of to the project. Ideally we're a group >=3 people who all can create releases and review and merge PRs.

[12:46] <patrickb> Xliff: I'll try to take a look at your PR in the evening.

[13:18] <lizmat> patrickb: agree, I think you / Xliff / vendethiel would make a good team
