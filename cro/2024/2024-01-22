[13:30] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Remote side connection tear down (via a GoAway packet) and new requests

[13:30] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: are racey. If they collide the request fails. The user shouldn't be

[13:30] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: bothered to handle that case. Thus we automatically retry the request

[13:30] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: also applies to the server) for it to tear down its pipeline. Otherwise the

[17:08] <patrickb> It's great to see those PRs merged nonetheless!

[17:09] <patrickb> so \o/ indeed
