[17:29] <patrickb> I'm wondering how we want to deal with version numbers in the different Cro components. Currently they still roughly align. Do we want to make/keep them aligned? If so, how? Or do we just not care and let the numbers drift  apart?

[17:31] <patrickb> If we decide to let them drift apart, I'd welcome some central place where it's easy to retrieve all of the Cro modules version numbers in a META6.json copy past able format. Then one can just copy-paste that thing into a META6.json and remove the non-needed components.
