[11:16] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> smokemachine: sorry this is taking a while basically the slowdown is that i am trying to get my head around my own ideas in this area … i would say that they are at the 80% level this morning so hopefully i can give sensible feedback in the next day or two

[11:18] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: np at all, and sorry if my message sounded like if I was trying to hurry you up... that was not my intent.

[11:20] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> my current direction of travel is to lean in to crotmp as a mechanism for hydration of components - eg a grid would need iterators that are fed from an @array and also for top and tail behaviour such as <:macro fn($body)> for turtles all the way down

[11:21] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> so my thinking is to build on the Template-Register pattern I already shared…

[11:22] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> no worries - your work and feedback is lending some relevance to mine and i am hopeful that we can coalesce on some common ground

[11:22] <SmokeMachine> I'm currently (on my free time) trying to find a way to add to crotmp a way to handle in a special way objects from a specific class... but I haven't started reading cro source yet
