[17:10] <ab5tract> jnthn: I hope you've had an excellent summer so far. Though saddened by the news out of Edument, I totally understand. I'm working at following the instructions at https://github.com/Raku/intellij-ide-plugin/blob/main/perl6-idea-plugin/docs/build.md

[17:11] <ab5tract> At first I didn't understand that the .cmd files are apparently some sort of wild cross-platform batch+bash shell script

[17:12] <ab5tract> After getting over that, I'm now struck by the fact that I can't seem to find a package matching `edument.perl6.comma.build`

[17:12] <ab5tract> Would this be something specific to the (now 404) repo `https://github.com/edumentab/intellij-community.git` ?

[17:14] <ab5tract> (I know this isn't cro-specific, but I wasn't sure where else to ping you that wasn't significantly larger in terms of audience)

[17:15] * ab5tract laughs at himself for only thinking of a direct message after the fact

[20:06] <jnthn> ab5tract: I thought I'd done a transfer of that to the Raku org, but maybe somehow it was forgotten. Just initiated a repository transfer now

[20:07] <jnthn> https://github.com/Raku/intellij-community is there now

[20:07] <ab5tract> jnthn: thanks!!

[20:08] <jnthn> You probably need the checkout of the perl6-idea-plugin repo inside of the checkout of that one

[20:08] <ab5tract> I think there might have been some confusion about naming, maybe https://github.com/Raku/intellij-ide-fork was what was needed all along

[20:08] <jnthn> Ah!

[20:09] <jnthn> So I did do it after all :)

[20:09] <jnthn> Just with a more sensible name :)

[20:09] <ab5tract> I'll take another stab and ping you directly if I'm too dumb to progress :)

[20:09] <ab5tract> naming, the answer to and cause of all $programmer problems :)
