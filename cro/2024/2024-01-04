[12:44] <Xliff_> I have a Cro application that has a route that uses the "static 'assets', 'mjs', @path, mime-types => 'application/javascript'" command.

[12:44] <Xliff_> Therefore all .mjs files in /assets/mjs should be returning a mime type of "application/javascript".

[12:45] <Xliff_> However an .mjs file that I have placed in the /assets/mjs directory is coming back as 'octet/stream' -- does someone have an idea of what I am doing wrong and any workarounds I can try?

[12:45] <Xliff_> How can I force the .mjs extension to be ANYTHING but 

[12:45] <Xliff_> 'octet/stream'

[13:20] <jnthn> My memory is a bit hazy, but I thought mime-types takes a hash of extension to type

[13:21] <jnthn> Yeah, there's an example in https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-router#Serving_static_content_from_files

[14:49] <Xliff_> Yeah, I had to force it.

[14:49] <Xliff_> Happy new year, jnthn.

[14:49] <Xliff_> I think I have found a way to give users their choice of angled tags or their own brew in Cro::WebApp::Template::Parser. Would you be interested in the PR?

[15:19] <jnthn> Happy new year!

[15:19] <jnthn> Not quite sure what you're suggesting, can you give an example?

[16:37] <Xliff_> So, if you have a deathly fear of angled brackets in your .crotmp files... you can set an option...

[16:37] <Xliff_> and <.variable> can become ... [% .varible %] for example

[16:38] <Xliff_> I have the grammar working. Now I just need to ensure the ASTs are properly created.

[16:38] <Xliff_> And the API I have is probably very ... fiddly.
