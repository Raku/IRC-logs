[10:26] <ab5tract> Unfortunately the same issue exists when using `intellij-ide-fork` : `FATAL: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Module 'edument.perl6.comma.build' was not found`

[10:34] <ab5tract> ah, that's right .. when I forked it, I lost the `comma-223.4884` branch. now things are probably back on track. cheers!
