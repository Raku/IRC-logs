[05:41] <Xliff> This mechanism could be exploited by Cro-based servers for implementing virtual hosting. Consider:

[05:42] <Xliff> route { get { content 'text.html', load-template('index.crotmp') }; } # Normal

[05:43] <Xliff> route { get -> :$Host is required is header where * eq 'my.virtual.host' { content 'text.html', load-template('mvh-index.crotmp') }; } # Only shows up when my.virtual.host is used to access the server

[05:43] <Xliff> There are drawbacks to this, but it is nice to know that the effect is possible.

[05:43] <Xliff> Now to figure out how to make it configurable.... Hmmm....
