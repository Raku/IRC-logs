[17:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I have finally got some concrete feedback onto your Cromponent proto - this is pretty much what I had in mind for functional composition of Cromponents, but using crotmp under the hood and optionally in assemblies depending on what floats you boat. I have offered as a PR hope this is a way to contribute.

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Next on my list is to elaborate the MyLib.rakumod to get CSS (SASS?) mixing in at the component level. I can be pretty self sufficient in that since I don't think that will need any changes to the existing prototype. (Although I epect you to be freely making any improvements you side so may have to reintegrate when you get to where you are going. Hopefully the form of the Cromponent classes/roles is stable since it

[17:48] <discord-raku-bot> is nicely declarative already imo)

[18:01] <SmokeMachine> Im currently trying to replace add-component with a trait `is cromponent` but I’m having a big problem of my trait not basing matched… :(

[21:03] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: I implemented 2 new features to Cromponent: now you can define a cromponent will use a macro instead of  a sub and for every  cromponent you create it creates the sub/macro with the name of the component, but now it also creates a sub/macro with the name <CromponentName>-new that instanciates the cromponent and uses it from inside the template: https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/macro.raku
