[18:03] <melezhik> o/ my cro application (sparky) consumes way too much CPU even being idle, is it typical for cro?

[18:03] <melezhik> basically here the code - https://github.com/melezhik/sparky/blob/master/bin/sparky-web.raku

[18:04] <melezhik> maybe web sockets do that?

[23:48] <japhb> melezhik: Did that work?  Because no, >2.6 cores at *idle* is really not normal.

[23:50] <japhb> I did a lot of work on Cro's WebSockets performance, and assuming you're not sending a *continuous* stream of packets or connection requests, or really *large* packets, it should barely even notice it.
