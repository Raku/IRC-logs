[01:24] <SmokeMachine> librasteve_: by reading your post (congratulations!) I think I found the problem you were getting. Cromponent should not be instantiated. It exports functions that should be used… unless that was you trying to workaround my bugs… :)

[11:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> SmokeMachine: I have just provided a more detailed explanation in the Issue - please comment with your feedback - I am hoping to merge your latest back into my workflow today / tomorrow and can apply the "instantiation" then, test and offer back as a PR to Cromponent if you agree that it is heading in the right direction

[11:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> forgive me if this was fixed in your latest - however, I think that my examples (multiple included route blocks) are testing a wider use case in this sense - but then maybe I misunderstand

[23:46] <SmokeMachine> I think Cro::HTTP::Router is breaking &trait_mod:<is>...

[23:48] <SmokeMachine> the only difference between AAA.rakumod and BBB.rakumod is that BBB is using Cro::HTTP::Router... and it breaks... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ar4uWfnP/image.png

[23:50] <SmokeMachine> just to make it clear: the method RENDER is not required to work nor to break...

[23:58] <SmokeMachine> doing use Cro::HTTP::Router qw//; seems to work...
