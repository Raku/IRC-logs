[16:20] <guifa> japhb : I've got a CATCH and CONTROL (in case it's a warn) handler in scope where I'm starting, but for whatever reason it's not trickling up / being handled within Cro

[16:40] <japhb> I wonder if MoarVM isn't throwing it properly or Rakudo isn't handling it properly ... hmm, or maybe one of the TLS wrapper modules.  Gah, too many possible failure points.
