[16:01] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> Hi everyone, so I've been using cro to make this for a while, https://github.com/arunvickram/begumpura and i was wondering if there was any way to speed up the build time when running cro run? I'm getting like 2-3 second delays when refreshing the page

[20:40] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> hi arun … sorry i was unable to help via your pm … having looked at the source i would guess that the server build time is dominated by running the 16ish crotmp files through the syntax Grammar (as mentioned Raku Grammars are doing a lot and they can be quite slow)

[20:41] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I suggest you comment out the use statements for a chunk of these and see if the build time is faster … then you will know where the slow path is

[20:44] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> If that’s the case, then maybe you can move the “library” of crotmp to a module and zef install that so that these are already precompiled ….??

[22:54] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @librasteve i feel like you shouldn't have to do any of that to not have a relatively slow feedback loop for a framework like cro
