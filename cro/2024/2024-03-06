[23:36] <japhb> I took a look at the PR, which seems pretty simple, but it's failing CI ... and as far as I can tell, that's unrelated to the PR, but rather a problem or incompatibility between Digest and the 2021.03 Rakudo release.

[23:38] <japhb> I want CI to actually be useful for us, so I'm going to try CI'ing with only Rakudo latest.  (I've recently come across at least one module that only works in 2023.12 or later *intentionally* so it seems there's a compatibility break there of some kind.)

[23:39] <japhb> OK, trying by just running the ubuntu-latest/latest Rakudo job in the CI version matrix, we'll see how it goes.
