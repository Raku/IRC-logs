[10:40] <emakei> hi. i'm trying to build small system with Cro and need understand how to find info about for example 'static'. Do i can parametrise html? Do I can use CSRF?

[10:43] <emakei> or maybe something like: "static <= header <= body <= my-hash-with-params"?

[10:45] <emakei> &static.WHY saying that i cannot use any params but this module is only that has working WHY. anyway thanks
