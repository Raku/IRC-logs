[18:49] <emakei> hi. I'd like to parametrise Cro::WebApp::Form with labels for fields (different languages). I found this https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/blob/master/lib/Cro/WebApp/Form.rakumod but still can't understand how to define my own constructor or use global variable to use instead of fixed 'label("my label")'

[18:58] <emakei> only 'input-label-class' and 'input-control-class' are available for my purpose?
