[00:11] <Xliff> Wakey wakey?

[00:11] <Xliff> Has anyone done anything with Cro::HTTP::Auth?

[00:32] <japhb> Xliff: A tiny bit: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-WebSimple/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/WebSimple/Session.rakumod

[00:33] <japhb> Xliff: That defines a session, and then the session-routes() sub here makes use of the definitions: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-UI-WebSimple/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/WebSimple/Routes.rakumod

[00:34] <Xliff> Thanks, japhb! I'll take a look, later.
