[14:34] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> Selfishly I would vote for a main point release when the API grows to cover fragments. So that’s 0.8.9.1 => 0.9.0.0 aiui, so that’s the Cro::WebApp piece. I can see that eg Cro::HTTP would not need a point bump. My feeling is that this is a bit of a horse race… so I would be pretty relaxed about version drift.

[20:26] <patrickb> I'll do a release of We app soon. Promised. (Actually I already started a few weeks ago, but didn't push through because of a few things I was unsure about.)

[20:26] <patrickb> Sorry for not having done so yet.

[20:43] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> patrickb: thank you ... it has been a couple of years (I guess) since last Cro release so no hurry !
