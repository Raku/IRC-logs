[19:21] <Xliff> \o

[19:21] <Xliff> has anyone been able to get Cro to serve https?

[19:21] <Xliff> I have a cert, and I've started a server on another port, but it still doesn't respond to https requests.

[19:22] <Xliff> Do I need to start the server in a particular way

[19:23] <lizmat> it should work, but I have never used it myself  :-(

[19:23] <lizmat> so no pointers from me  :-(

[19:34] <Xliff> LOL! OK. Thanks for telling me.
