[20:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> please do keep the installments coming

[20:03] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have tried this https://gist.github.com/librasteve/2b2ee2f2739d50c274032ae28a27a717 (not working yet by maybe give you an idea of what I mean by nesting ... guess I need all my components to have an id of some sort (which may well be a good idea anyway), or need to change your Cromponent.rakumod lib...)

[20:04] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> sorry some of my earlier comments were off beam - I like the direction you are driving - don't let me slow you down!

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> I have had to take a bit more time to appreciate your prototype design ... todos is a great place to start due to the dynamism ...

[20:06] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ;-)

[20:27] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: why not something like this? https://github.com/FCO/Cromponent/blob/main/bin/librasteve.raku

[20:28] <SmokeMachine> (sorry, I modified your example and added it to the cromponent repo...)

[20:58] <SmokeMachine> librasteve: this modified version of your code seems to be working (if it should do what I supposed it should do...)

[21:10] *** Pe_Elle joined
[21:59] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> holy crap - it works!

[22:00] <SmokeMachine> yes, it does... :)

[22:00] <SmokeMachine> Is that what you wanted?

[22:00] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> add-component Table, Row, Col; would be good to have

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> ;-)

[22:01] <SmokeMachine> yes, and that's easy to implement

[22:01] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> yes, pretty much one of the key needs

[22:14] *** Pe_Elle left
[22:18] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> and I see now that this feature was there all along ... although still need a bit of testing to check the edgses...
