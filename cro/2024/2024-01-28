[10:07] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: patrickbkr++ created pull request #192: Fix HTTP1.1 connection caching with explicitly given version

[10:07] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: review: https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/pull/192

[10:16] <patrickb> Two more PRs are up. I think there is at least one more issue in HTTP::Client where the OS TCP connections aren't torn down correctly and pile up (and eventually depletes them, causing a lock up). I haven't been able to reproduce that issue reliably yet though.
