[15:02] <librasteve_> o/

[15:03] <librasteve_> I am trying to run Cro on a clean ubuntu machine build on AWS EC 24.04LTS … as you would expect I am user ubuntu and I can sudo to do stuff as root

[15:03] <librasteve_> I can run a cro service locally eg on port 10000 and view the result with lynx, but when I try to attach to port 80 I run into issues…

[15:05] <librasteve_> `ubuntu: ~/simple raku simple.raku` gives permission denied error

[15:06] <librasteve_> this is `ubuntu: sudo raku simple.raku` ;-( https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Inl5W71w

[15:08] <librasteve_> this is `ubuntu: sudo raku -I/home/ubuntu/.raku simple.raku ` (that being where zef has installed my Cro::HTTP::Server and so on) https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/P5uHRVFy

[15:08] <librasteve_> are there any ubuntu folk who can help?? please

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <librasteve> [double check AWS security group ...]

[15:13] <librasteve_> yep that seems ok `IPv4 HTTP TCP 80 0.0.0.0/0`

[17:09] <librasteve_> okaaay - some time later I realised that trying to bridge between running cro as ubuntu and needing to be root to grab port 80 would best be done with nginx in the long term anyway

[17:10] <librasteve_> so I found some advice here https://chatgpt.com/share/6748a185-c690-8009-96ff-80bf8018dd7d and, lo and behold it works!
