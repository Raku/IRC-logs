[22:11] <patrickb> [Coke]: Did you try with those three PRs applied, if the problem persists?

[22:13] <patrickb> The GOAWAY is definitely covered by those PRs.

[22:13] <[Coke]> can't rely on another user having the PR'd version.

[22:14] <[Coke]> Sorry, was just trying to get a fast solution to my own issue, so it was easy to handle the goaway exception

[22:17] <patrickb> Argh! I want those PRs merged! They are blocked on review for like 4 months now and we haven't yet come up with a working review strategy for the project. I think there currently is no one even feeling responsible to look at PRs in the Cro project. (I do to some extent, but I can't review my own PRs.)
