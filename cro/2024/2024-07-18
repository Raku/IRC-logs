[06:14] <lizmat> patrickb: I have the power to merge, but I'm seeing CI failing..

[06:15] <lizmat> worse: I can't even see anymore why they are failing, as the logs have expired

[06:15] <lizmat> perhaps we need a PR to get CI whipped into shape first ?

[06:19] *** sena_kun joined
[06:51] <patrickb> lizmat: Thanks for the offer! Just to be clear, I have the power to merge as well. What I need is a review. (Because we said, that the policy should be to not merge without a review.) I'll see what I can do about the CI.

[12:51] <patrickb> lizmat: ^ This should get the tests passing again. Once that's merged, I can rebase my PRs onto it.

[13:43] <patrickb> Open question: Should we for now pause the "require review" rule for non-feature (i.e. bugfix) changes that don't change the API? (Such changes can't add irreversible "damage". They can easily be reverted.) I'm unsure this is a good idea

[13:43] <patrickb> or a bad idea.

[13:51] <[Coke]> In general, I'm in favor of require review for something in the community bucket.

[13:52] <[Coke]> Which sounds like I'm volunteering to help review PRs in the bucket. (I guess I am?)

[13:53] <[Coke]> My issue with committing to review is that, IIRC, I couldn't install all of Cro on my mac the last time I tried.

[14:07] <patrickb> I think there is often less incentive reviewing PRs than there is creating them, because a PR I make scratches my itch, while a PR someone else creates scratches their itch.

[14:11] <patrickb> And then reviewing a PR often feels like taking responsibility for a change while creating a PR feels less so. I guess that's just psychology we have to live with.

[14:12] <patrickb> Question is, what can we change to improve the dynamics?

[14:17] <patrickb> Can you provide more info on the Cro on Mac failure? We should do something about that.

[15:41] <[Coke]> I don't remember the actual issue at this point, I'll try a fresh install and see.

[15:41] <[Coke]> the only reason to run with --/test is for speed, yes? I should still expect all tests to pass?

[16:02] <[Coke]> doing a zef install --serial --verbose cro - (did on without serial, and it got to cro itself but appeared to hang)

[16:03] <[Coke]> Do we need NETWORKING_TESTING set for anything in cro's testing?

[16:19] <[Coke]> cro seems to hang on tests here: [cro] ok 11 - Got log line mentioning status code

[16:19] <[Coke]> I'll check out that version and test in-repo

[16:21] <[Coke]> That's midway through t/tools-runner.rakutest

[17:29] <patrickb> It managed to get to "cro"? Given that "cro" is just the command line tool to help a bit with minting and running projects, the interesting bits seem to all have been installed.

[17:51] <[Coke]> ah, I think this might be https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/85

[17:52] <lizmat> Mojave is sooo 2019 :-)

[17:53] <[Coke]> I hate OS names so much. I'm on Sonoma now

[17:53] <lizmat> actually...  so 2015

[17:53] <lizmat> the thing is, the IRC logs server runs on a 2015 iMac with Mojave

[17:53] <lizmat> and it's based on cro  :-)

[17:57] <patrickb> So it is non-reproducably failing on Mojave onwards?

[17:58] <patrickb> It's a failure in the "cro" distribution, it doesn't affect any Cro apps themself as "cro" is a dev tool.

[18:01] <patrickb> Looking at the test file, it's possible the failures are fixed by the PRs of mine.

[18:02] <lizmat> sadly, that box is the only one I have running Mojave still, and it's doing production, so I'd rather not run any testing on it

[18:16] <patrickb> Let me revise that. I don't think the error is fixed by the PRs of mine. It's using Cro::HTTP::Client, but not reusing connections.

[22:05] <[Coke]> Should we get issues/commits/prs announced in here?

[22:05] * [Coke] opens https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/197

[22:13] <[Coke]> oops, it's actually in cro::uri
