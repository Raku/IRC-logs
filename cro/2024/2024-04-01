[14:12] <Xliff> lizmat: Did you see my earlier comment about implementing virtual domains with Cro::HTTP::Router?

[14:15] <lizmat> yes, I did, sounds like being useful ?

[14:36] <Xliff> Yes, think I have a way to formalize it so that you don't have to add it to a signature for every method you want on that virtual domain.

[14:36] <Xliff> I'm still hoping I can get my Raku-based app server released from $dayJob.

[15:53] <lizmat> that'd be cool
