[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: Fix HTTP2 connections with multiple streams stalling

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: 

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: HTTP2 knows a stream and connection flow-control window. Both windows need

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: to be respected. A logic was put in place, to not update the window sizes

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: when the stream that sent the data was closed. That's fine. But we do need

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: to update the global window, otherwise the global window size permanently

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: shrinks by that amount. When reusing a connection many times, this shinks

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: the window size down to zero over time, effectively stalling the

[10:24] <Geth> ¦ cro-http: connection.
