[01:16] <SmokeMachine> Where is this project? I’d like to take a look at those Red calls, if possible

[04:34] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine here it is: https://github.com/arunvickram/begumpura

[05:03] <SmokeMachine> aruniecrisps: I’m asking just by curiosity, I don’t remember how well it’s working, but have you tried this for sessions? https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red

[05:03] <SmokeMachine> Oh! You are using that!

[05:04] <SmokeMachine> Even sub-model :)

[05:11] <SmokeMachine> So, what are you thinking of Red with Cro? Any critique or suggestion? Anything you think would be better to change?

[05:17] <SmokeMachine> Have you seen this? https://github.com/FCO/BlogSchema

[15:03] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine it's hard to say, there are things like about Red and things i'm not the biggest fan of

[15:04] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i went and took a look at the codebase and it uses a lot of raku stuff im not familiar with and that i couldn't find that much documentation for like ClassHOW

[15:07] <SmokeMachine> What I’ve learned about ClassHOW was reading the code and asking on IRC…

[15:09] <SmokeMachine> What do you like and what you are not the biggest fan of?

[15:12] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine i like the DSL, it's very straight forward for people that are already familiar with Raku

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> like i love the usage of grep in the DSL, it makes perfect sense

[15:13] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i also like how defing inflators and deflators is pretty straight forward

[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> as for what i don't like, i remember having to use :require<Models::Post> as part of the definition of the User model, which i feel like I should be able to pull off with just a use Models::Post at the top of the file

[15:19] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i thought that was a bit confusing

[15:28] <SmokeMachine> If you use the name of the model the same as the dir/file, you don’t need that… I mean, if the model was called Models::Post, or it was on lib/Post.pm, you would not need doing that

[15:30] <SmokeMachine> Red expects to require the name based on the model name…

[15:32] <SmokeMachine> Or you could probably “rename” it on your META6.json

[16:00] *** Pe_Elle joined
[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> it's provided as Models::Post in META6.json

[16:11] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> but in the file i have it set up as model Post

[16:16] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> i remember it not working unless i added the :requires<Models::Post> to the relationship trait in the model

[16:19] <SmokeMachine> That’s what I ment, if on your META6 it was defined as just Post, you wouldn’t need the :requires

[16:20] <SmokeMachine> If the name of the model isn’t the same as the one used to require, you will need to :requires

[17:50] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> @SmokeMachine im assuming the :require is loading from a CompUnit::Repository to load all that?

[17:51] <discord-raku-bot> <aruniecrisps> to load Models::Post i mean

[17:55] <SmokeMachine> it just require()s it: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red/Attr/Relationship.rakumod#L64

[17:57] <lizmat> oops, ww  :-)

[23:01] <patrickb> I've reworked the release process and script here: https://github.com/croservices/release/pull/4

[23:02] <patrickb> I'd like a review of both, the process and script.
