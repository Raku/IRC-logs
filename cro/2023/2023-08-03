[15:14] <ab5tract> So I've been trying to use the croservices/cro-http:0.8.9 image and am getting an error about zef not being installed (using the default Dockerfile generated by Comma)

[15:23] <ab5tract> I'm trying to use the rakudo-star image as the base instead, but it seems to require a lot of extra work to get into proper shape
