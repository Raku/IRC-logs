[17:31] <jdv> jnthn: in short, the ssl cert for the site doesn't include www which is what most search engines resolve to, oddly google seems to be the only one that doesn't point to www.cro.services.

[17:32] <jdv> not hugely important but "not a good look" kinda thing for new peeps:)

[17:39] <jnthn> Why do they do that? And why is this coming up now, when the configuration has been the same for 3-4 years? :/

[17:40] <jnthn> If it's easy to get an extra name on the cert then I guess it'll be an easy fix, but I've no idea if it is.

[19:42] <patrickb> I think I've seen this being reported before.

[20:02] <patrickb> Now that I think about it, jnthn can I remind you about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5202
