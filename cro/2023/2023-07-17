[02:19] <SmokeMachine> Is that ok if I do a COMMA question here? it may be a bug. Comma seems to not be recognising exports from EXPORT sub. I have this example (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/examples/test1/test-watch.raku) where Test1Config is found but none of its functions were found by comma. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wXjbeyDv/image.png

[02:21] <SmokeMachine> There is also this other example (https://github.com/FCO/Configuration/blob/main/examples/test1/test1.rakuconfig) that I've overwrote the filetype for Raku and the same module is used, but comma can't find it's exports... https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/VLw42vX1/image.png

[02:22] <SmokeMachine> Is that a bug, am I doing something wrong or is it expected?

[02:22] <SmokeMachine> Thank you in advance, sorry for flooding and if I shouldn't have sent it here.
