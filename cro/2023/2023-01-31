[17:00] <[Coke]> https://github.com/jnthn/raku-log-timeline/issues/13 is my current blocker for running cro on windows.

[17:01] <[Coke]> How can I escalate this out of just jnthn's module?

[17:01] <[Coke]> I'm basically reduced to shelling out to curl at this point to get client functionality

[18:18] <[Coke]> using HTTP::UserAgent as a client instead of curl, at least. found HTTP::Tiny also had windows issues.

[19:32] <jnthn> [Coke]: If it's just a case of tests, install with --/test ?

[20:34] <[Coke]>  if I have to disable the tests, I have zero confidence in the module

[20:56] <jnthn> OK, then use something else.

[20:57] <[Coke]> other than cro. ok.

[22:14] <JRaspass> FWIW the HTTP::Tiny issue is just that mirror isn't closing the handle before renaming and windows is fussy, so as long as you don't use mirror you can comfortably disable the tests, afaik JJ is on it
