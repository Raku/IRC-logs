[13:21] <jnthn> A `route` block is just a way to define a Cro::Transform from HTTP request to HTTP responses; it's not involved with listening, etc.

[13:23] <jnthn> request.annotations is made for stashing stuff per-request, so if you want to associate a connection with a request you can stash it in there, although one can't really make an assumption about threads

[13:23] <jnthn> If a route handler `await`s then it might resume on a different thread after

[13:24] <jnthn> But it would be safe to, for example, have request/response middleware that obtains a connection from a pool, associates it with a request, and then puts it back in the pool when the response is sent.
