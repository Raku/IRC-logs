[10:22] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: I think there's a difference between modules with EXPORT inside of a project and dependencies with EXPORT. For the latter, we run a script that does the `use` and then introspects what is exported, and since that runs any EXPORT sub it should get such things, in theory. 

[10:23] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: But for things within the project we want a more sophisticated model, and so go from the source, looking for `is export` traits etc. And since Comma is not a Raku compiler/interpreter, but just a parser (with some abstract interp) it can't really figure out what EXPORT does.

[10:24] <jnthn> I guess in principle when we see there's an `is EXPORT` we can try running it, but we'd need to probably do the "do you trust this project" prompt before that.

[10:25] <jnthn> (We figure it's OK to run code in installed modules because the act of installing them can be taken as trust, but have been hesitant to have stuff automatically be run by the project being opened...)

[10:25] <jnthn> Anyway, probably we can do something better in this area.

[10:26] <jnthn> .tell Xliff The `around` blocks in an outer route block will be applied to the inner routes blocks that are `include`d also.
