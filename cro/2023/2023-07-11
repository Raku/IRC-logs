[10:29] <Xliff> jnthn: Regarding before handlers. Is there a way to set a before handler so it is run as the first thing in the request?

[11:49] <lizmat> .oO( the way-before handler :-)

[13:21] <Xliff> lizmat: *snrk*

[13:21] <Xliff> Is that like the way-back machine?

[13:22] <lizmat> no don't think so  :-)

[14:33] <Xliff> If I have a "before Cro::HTTP::Session::InMemory[MySessionUser]" middleware, how can I get the MySessionUser object from another, wrapped before middleware?

[20:33] <jnthn> Applying the middleware in the server is a sure-fire way since those get a look in before any applied in a route block. But generally they are executed in the order they are applied, so make sure it's in the outer-most route block of the application and before any other `before`.

[20:34] <jnthn> And you get the session object via the `.auth` property on the Cro::HTTP::Request; see https://cro.services/docs/http-auth-and-sessions
