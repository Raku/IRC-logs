[07:22] <Xliff> Hello!

[07:24] <Xliff> If I'm serving static pages using "static 'static-data/content', @path" and want to have a custom handler deal with directory contents.. what would such a route handler look like?

[15:38] <jnthn> Xliff: Hmm, you mean directory content listings? Think probably you'd need to explicitly form the path and do a `.d` check and serve the listing, and otherwise call `static`. I don't think there's anything build in for this.

[15:38] <jnthn> *built-in

[16:33] <Xliff> jnthn: So.. something like "get -> 'root', *@nodes { ... }"

[16:40] <jgaz> On https://cro.services it looks like the links to the domains raku.courses and raku.consulting no longer work. Maybe the domains were not renewed?

[16:41] <jnthn> Ah yes, keep meaning to remove those

[16:49] <jgaz> I figured it was an oversight.

[16:51] <jnthn> Xliff: Maybe something like `get -> 'root', *@nodes where 'static-data/content'.IO.&child-secure(@nodes.join('/').d { ... }
