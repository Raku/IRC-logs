[16:22] <[Coke]> trying to install cro on an m2 mac. if I use zef, the tests show t/tools-crofile.rakutest and t/tools-link-editor.rakutest and then it hangs.

[16:23] <[Coke]> same behavior if I do "zef test ." in a git clone

[16:23] <[Coke]> ... I lied. it just hangs for much less time!

[16:24] <[Coke]> so running local works, whether I run the tests manually (raku -I. t/xxx) or 'zef test .' - but the latest released version (0.8.9) hangs - passing --verbose to zef shows no output after those first two tests are run

[16:26] <[Coke]> looks like similar behavior on the release-0.8.9 tag. Can we get another release with the last few commits on master?

[16:27] <[Coke]> (one of which is a commit specifically talking about macos tests!)
