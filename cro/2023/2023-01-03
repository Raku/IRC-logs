[02:28] <melezhik> Hi! I am writing a help script that demonize `cro run` command via `nohub cro run &` everything works fine, however when cro sees changes in files it runs a new process of web app, so I end up with a bunch of process instead of the one ...

[02:28] <melezhik> I am not sure if this is correct behavior , I expect this will be just a one process

[02:29] <melezhik> at least this is how it works ( just one process exists) when I demonize `cro run` via Â systemd

[02:29] <melezhik> nohub -> nohup

[02:30] <melezhik> I am on mac os

[02:38] <melezhik> sorry, keep looking into this , maybe issue with helper script ... not sure, will get back with more details later

[02:50] <japhb> melezhik: `cro run` is intended for developer use, not as your production instance.  You can run your service file directly, or you can use Docker/Kubernetes as in https://cro.services/docs/docker-deployment

[02:51] <japhb> Focusing on developer needs is why `cro run` autorestarts when it sees changes to the file tree.

[20:13] <melezhik> .

[20:14] <melezhik> japhb: Docker or k8s is overkill for my situation , how can I still run cro app without restart feature ?

[20:23] <Xliff> \o

[20:25] <Xliff> I have a token, defined as 'token dc { "::" }'. I want to parse it globally. How can I do this using the "$content ~~ ::('&dc')" form of the call?

[20:28] *** melezhik joined
[20:29] <Xliff> m: token a { 'a' }; "Alpha Malpha Malp".match( &a, :g ).gist.say

[20:30] <melezhik> also imho docker and k8s is not the only way to deploy to production ... I think I am going to use "nohup raku app.raku < /dev/null  &" instead of cro

[20:31] <japhb> melezhik: Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.  Run the app script, not the cro tool.
