[15:00] <Xliff> lizmat: I can't seem to get the Cairo Raku module to find libcairo.2.dylib -- do you have any ideas as to what I might be missing

[15:01] <lizmat> you're on MacOS right?

[15:01] <Xliff> I've installed the Cairo lib using brew. Is there an env variable that I need to set?

[15:01] <Xliff> Yep.

[15:02] <Xliff> Ah! Thank you. That might get messy... lol!

[15:03] <Xliff> Also... do you know how I can enable SSH?

[15:04] <lizmat> System Preferences / Sharing 

[15:04] <lizmat> Remote Login
