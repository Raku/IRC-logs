[17:59] <QhpAptyj9hj0RQwM> Probably a stupid question, but is Cro a web server, or can I use it with a web server of my choice?

[18:00] <lizmat> Cro is more than just a web server, but yes, it is also a web server that understands various web protocols very well

[18:01] <lizmat> personally, I have a reverse-proxy facing the world and have a Cro server sitting behind that

[18:02] <lizmat> with the proxy taking care of https and possibly delivering static content

[18:32] <QhpAptyj9hj0RQwM> lizmat: Sweet, thanks Liz. 

[18:32] <QhpAptyj9hj0RQwM> Is there a guide on how to configure Cro to only talk to the reverse proxy?

[20:02] <JRaspass> raku.land does caddy in front of cro, caddy is really easy to setup as a reverse proxy
