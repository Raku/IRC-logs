[11:13] <Xliff> I want to send a file from a Cro router. How can I set the proper filename and content-type on such a response?

[11:14] <Xliff> I'm currently doing the following: $response.append-header('Content-disposition', 'atttachment: report.xslx' ); content  'application/vnd.ms-excel', ...; 

[11:15] <Xliff> And while that works, it's not setting the downloaded content to "report.xlsx"

[16:27] <thowe> I don't know if I just need help navigating docs or what, but when I create the example stub hello, the service.raku file has Cro::Service seems to require env variables HELLO_HOST and HELLO_PORT.  It's not getting them from my env or from the Docker file, so where is it getting those that it doesn't just throw an exception?  I don't see anything about these env variables in the docs.  How are they being set?

[16:28] <thowe> was just following docs here: https://cro.services/docs/intro/getstarted

[18:25] <jnthn> If you were following them, you'd have done `cro run` after `cro stub`, and the runner provides the env vars :)

[18:35] <Xliff> \o again!

[18:35] <Xliff> I want to send a file from a Cro router. How can I set the proper filename and content-type on such a response?

[18:35] <Xliff> I'm currently doing the following: $response.append-header('Content-Disposition', 'atttachment: report.xslx' ); content 'application/vnd.ms-excel', ...;

[18:36] <Xliff> And while that works, it's not setting the downloaded content to "report.xlsx"

[18:36] <Xliff> Any ideas?

[18:43] <Xliff> Um... er.... oh

[18:43] <Xliff> This worked.

[18:43] <Xliff> $response.append-header('Content-Disposition', 'atttachment; filename=report.xslx' );

[20:10] <thowe> jnthn: cool; where are the env vars provided by cro run documented?

[20:11] <thowe> also, how do you do that markup you did around cro run and cro stub? (I'm running convos)

[21:56] <jnthn> Backticks, as in Markdown

[21:56] <jnthn> For docs see https://cro.services/docs/cro-yml

[21:57] <jnthn> And https://cro.services/docs/cro-tool

[21:57] <jnthn> Xliff: Is it really meant to be a colon after "attachment"? I have a hazy memory it should be a semi...

[21:58] <jnthn> Ah, and with `filename=` apparently, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition
