[20:05] <Xliff> jnthn: Are connections answered by the top level route block in a Cro application?

[20:06] <Xliff> I'd like to handle database connections per answering thread, and I just need to know if I can send that down, or if I need another mechanism to get the proper database handle to the correct controller.

[20:11] <Xliff> jnthn: Would request.annotations<db> be an appropriate mechanism?
