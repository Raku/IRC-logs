[11:51] <jnthn> Xliff: Looks like a cookie with an invalid value is in the HTTP request

[11:51] <jnthn> CookieValue is a subset type, so it's just saying it got a string that doesn't match the constraint on a cookie value

[11:52] <jnthn> Either the cookie value is malformed per RFC, or Cro::HTTP's cookie parser is out of line with the RFC.

[11:54] <jnthn> Xliff: Also make sure you have a recent Cro version, since for example https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/171 got fixed a while back
