[17:07] <Xliff> Can you assign an object to request.response.auth?

[17:08] <Xliff> jnthn: ^^ (hope you had a great weekend!)

[17:10] <lizmat> jnthn is on holiday for at least another week

[17:14] <Xliff> Ah, thanks.

[17:15] <lizmat> and sadly, I don't have an answer either :-(

[17:15] <lizmat> apart from "read the source" and "try it"  :-)

[17:57] <Xliff> lizmat: And on that note, I'll take your advice... 

[17:57] <Xliff> But first... a nap!
