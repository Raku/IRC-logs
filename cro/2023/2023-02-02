[20:02] <Xliff> Can cro retrieve from FTP urls?

[20:12] <lizmat> I don't think Cro supports FTP out of the box, but it should be (relatively) easy to implement it with Cro?

[20:12] <lizmat> it's 20+ years ago since I did anything with FTP  :-)

[20:29] <Xliff> Ah! No matter. LibCurl::Easy supports 'em.

[20:29] <Xliff> Thanks lizmat.
