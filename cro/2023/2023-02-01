[09:43] <jjatria> FWIW, I think I've figured this out on HTTP::Tiny at least. I should be able to verify on Windows in the evening and push out a new release

[09:55] <JRaspass> I wish Gitlab made it easier to test windows, I think GH Actions are slightly superior in this way

[17:35] <Xliff> I'm having a spot of trouble with Cro::WebApp::Template and Nil values.

[17:36] <Xliff> Is there a mechanism whereas a default value can be assigned, so that if at any point in a dot-expansion the value is Nil, then that default value could be returned instead, as opposed to an exception?
