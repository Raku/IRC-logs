[12:30] <patrickb> ^ That's the previous discussion / concept making for versioning the Raku documentation.

[16:35] <[Coke]> There is a first pass at an ebook here: click https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/, More, epub, then there's a (subtle) link in the popup.

[16:35] <[Coke]> it's a dump of all the primary material, definitely needs consideration on ordering, style, a cover, etc.

[16:36] <[Coke]> finanalyst++

[16:59] <ab5tract> unfortunately it doesn't open in the Books app for me (macOS)

[17:06] <ab5tract> not sure if there's a debugging option for this but I'll look into it and share anything I learn

[17:12] <lizmat> fwiw, I've downloaded Yomu and that at least opens it after complaining it's not compliant because of missing TOC

[18:51] <[Coke]> it's epub v3, guessing books doesn't respect it. It does work in calibre, which you can install on a mac with `brew install --cask calibre`

[18:51] <[Coke]> ah, books just complains, doesn't say why. :)

[18:52] <[Coke]> added that to the PR.

[18:53] <[Coke]> I'm happy to get this merged as is, and we can do some cleanup work.
