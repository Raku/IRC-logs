[23:09] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: While `<|w>` works in Rakudo, it isn't official Raku, and while I personally like it, there's a chance it will go away. Its semantics are the same as `<?wb>`, which _is_ official Raku, so I've switched to that. (See also https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/5c1a147e68e800a35baea3505f4cdc14fee63efa.)

[23:09] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: But for _this_ change I'm making sure I do it as a PR. I still expect it to work, but it may not, and the consequence of that might be a waste of others' time, and even if it does it might not be wanted.
