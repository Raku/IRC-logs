[14:49] <coleman> [Coke] I edited your issue to collapse the error message into a drop down

[14:49] <coleman> GitHub markdown supports (some) inline HTML, so you can use the <details></details> tag!

[14:50] <coleman> Just make sure there is a newline above and below any triple backtick code fence ```
