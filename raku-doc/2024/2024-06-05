[11:32] <tbrowder> finanalyst: hi. does yr pod 2.0 have a construct to include another pod doc into its flow?

[11:36] <tbrowder> if not, i think that would be a very useful thing, esp. for pdf doc construction (such as adding boilerplate text fragments)

[11:40] <tbrowder> maybe useful for web docs, too

[11:57] <tbrowder> very cool, thnx

[12:56] <[Coke]> P<> is documented on the site (saw it when editing L<>) but I never used it

[12:57] <[Coke]> That would handle one of our "don't repeat yourself" in source problems in the docs.

[13:01] <[Coke]> except it seems to be completely ignored by raku --doc. :P

[13:02] <[Coke]> Need to add "Pod::To::Text" as unsupported in the list. OK, I'll add the new rakudoc as a prereq for that todo item.
