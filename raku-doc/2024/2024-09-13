[10:14] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/a8c7e7166e - is that correct? The colons aren't for ratcheting?

[10:17] <[Coke]> looks like f0661bf332 added them in a refactor accidentally, ok.

[16:23] <lucs> Hmm... Now, reading about backtracking in the same file, I'm not so sure those colons were spurious.

[16:23] <lucs> Will verify and report back.

[16:26] <[Coke]> I checked the history and they weren't in the previous version of that file, but I only went back one revision

[16:26] <[Coke]> thanks for checking!

[18:42] <lucs> Welp, it turns out that matches will succeed or fail irrespective of the presence of the "don't-backtrack" colon, but having it avoids what would be useless backtracking, and that is probably how it is implemented and why Daniel added the colons in the f0661bf332 commit.

[18:43] <lucs> So the colons do indeed express the 'token' non-backtracking aspect of <ws>, and I will revert my commit.

[19:49] <lucs> I was thinking of normalizing spellings to "uppercase" from "upper case" and "upper-case" (and similarly for lower- and title-).

[19:49] <lucs> Should I?

[19:51] <[Coke]> Yes, please - please add it as a check to xt/word-variants.rakutest and then make the test pass.

[19:51] <[Coke]> s/it/them/

[19:52] <lucs> OK.

[19:52] <[Coke]> good catch, looks like there's a lot of them.

[20:45] <lucs> Um, is there a style guide (for example) where I could confirm -- hopefully! :-) -- that the Oxford comma is recommended.

[20:45] <lucs> And if not, is it?

[20:56] <lucs> Welp, I'm using it.

[21:03] <[Coke]> would definitely take a writing-docs/STYLEGUIDE.md update to add that.
