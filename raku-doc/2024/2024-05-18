[16:23] <[Coke]> Do we have a way for me to wrap a block of text with a POD object that has a tag? I want something like:

[16:23] <[Coke]> <span tag="label.one">This is some text</span>

[16:24] <[Coke]> and then write an xt/ test to verify that all spans with that tag have the exact same (rendered text? raw code?)

[16:25] <[Coke]> Please comment on https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/1924 with suggestions.
