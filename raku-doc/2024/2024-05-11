[14:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Attempts to fix #4449 with a Wikipedia link. There is a more formal [link](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch04.pdf) from the Unicode standard itself but i) the next sentence refers to the Wikipedia page (a subsection therein) already and ii) formal link is harder to digest as it is a reference document and it's also a PDF.
