[18:18] <sjn> Hey, is this a thing worth considering? https://nick.groenen.me/notes/one-sentence-per-line/

[19:03] <[Coke]> Nifty, although I'd hestitate to change things en masse at this point

[19:16] <[Coke]> Right now we have a hodgepodge - we did a rewrap at some point, but it's not enforced.

[20:05] <sjn> well, doing an en-masse change would be reckless, killing any usefulness of diffs across that event, but would it make sense to update some documentation policy and/or linters? (dunno if there is such a thing)

[20:21] <tbrowder> [Coke]: i think i got your suggested changes made, but my git edit pr foo is shaky
