[10:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/serve_the_ebook: - The main config file has Website as the default Mode so calling build-site without it works

[10:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/serve_the_ebook: - To generate a different Mode, it needs to be explicit, so next build-site stanza has EBook

[10:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/serve_the_ebook: - the config file has the ebook's destination as rendered_html, so no need to copy the file
