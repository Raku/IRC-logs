[17:37] <[Coke]> coleman: how can I run the website locally? I have instructions for testing out the caddy file, but that's using quay.io/colemanx/raku-doc-website

[17:37] <[Coke]> I want to be able to do a git bisect and run the site at each bisect step

[17:38] <[Coke]> (I have been doing this for 20 commits until I just realized why I kept getting the same error. :)

[17:40] <[Coke]> looks like the docker image is just latest, so I can't use that to go back in time.

[19:28] <finanalyst> [Coke] I think the error may be occuring because there has been a change in the JS library

[19:28] <[Coke]> Are we including just "latest" instead of a specific version? That'd do it

[19:29] <finanalyst> Checking

[19:31] <finanalyst> It seems we are pulling the latest version, not a tagged release. There is no tagged release for fuzzysort

[19:55] <coleman> [Coke] I replied on the issue. I'm WFH today so hit me up if it doesn't work.

[19:57] <[Coke]> Thanks. we think it might be the 3rd party lib, we didn't pin it to a version
