[16:00] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Add mention of v6.e.PREVIEW and 6.*

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Document "use v6" as being meaningless nowadays, and reshuffle contents

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: a bit.

[16:00] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/43e190e906

[16:28] <[Coke]> Should we deprecate "use v6" in e, and remove it in f?

[16:31] <lizmat> that feels like a plan  :-)

[16:32] <lizmat> actually, we should make it a worry

[16:32] <lizmat> hmmm 

[16:33] <lizmat> no, deprecation would be better

[16:38] <[Coke]> or maybe put it under the p5isms thing

[16:39] <lizmat> well, you wouldn't be able to activate it as a p5ism

[16:39] <lizmat> as use v6 needs to be the first statemennt

[16:39] <[Coke]> ah
