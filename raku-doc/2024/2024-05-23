[13:42] <[Coke]> whew.

[13:43] <[Coke]> very thankful his repo is still around. Much easier to get a patch file from the last few commits in the branch and tweak that rather than try to rebase a copy.

[13:46] <[Coke]> One more slightly tricky one, 2 easy ones.

[16:37] <[Coke]> I think the check-signatures test has been subtly broken for a while and we didn't notice because the default was to skip so much

[17:01] <[Coke]> Rant: we have too many adhoc exceptions

[17:27] <[Coke]> wtf. I am trying to debug check-signatures. I am using RAKUDO_SRC=/Users/coke/sandbox/rakudo - but I am now getting an error message that it's trying to open /Volumes/xxx/doc/../rakudo/src/core.c/allomorphs.rakumod - like it's ignoring the env var entirely and just looking for ../rakudo

[17:27] <[Coke]> (I've got this checkout in that /Volume)

[17:28] <[Coke]> ... Dammit.             my $src-line := slurp( $*PROGRAM.parent(3).add("rakudo/" ~ $method.file.split('::')[1])

[17:33] <[Coke]> So it was using the src dir at the top of the file but not where it counted.

[23:26] <[Coke]> ^^ that is an easy set of changes: basically convert most uses of multi sub to multi in code snippets. you can add an :ok-test<multi> if we're showing multi sub explicitly
