[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: addresses issue #372 by adding announcement popup & page

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: 

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: - announcements.rakudoc is the source for the anouncement page and is contained in 'structure-sources' for this PR

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: - When the website is opened an announcement modal pops-up

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: - Once dismissed, it never appears again for that announcement

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: - Adding a `Note` to the ***top*** of the announcements page changes the id of the last pop-up and so the new announcement will be popped when next the website is opened by a user

[11:10] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/docs-dev: - announcements can be suppressed by toggle in the ABOUT dropdown.

[14:12] <[Coke]> ^^ you can see the announcement by going to any url in docs-dev, e.g. https://docs-dev.raku.org/reference

[14:14] <[Coke]> finanalyst++

[14:16] <finanalyst> [Coke] I dont want to merge to main until we have decided where to put the announcements source

[14:18] <finanalyst> [Coke] you can test the suppression by changing Website/structure-sources/announcements.rakudoc then commiting

[14:18] <finanalyst> since the branch is still 'docs-dev' it wont be seen by everyone yet

[14:19] <finanalyst> also docs-dev commits dont need approval,

[16:11] <[Coke]> can we pull the source from the doc repo instead of doc-website?

[16:11] <[Coke]> Or is that too fiddly?

[16:12] <finanalyst> [Coke] my recommendation in PR is for the source to be on doc repo

[16:12] <[Coke]> +1

[16:12] <finanalyst> actually makes things much easier

[16:12] <[Coke]> Let me reread the last comments there.

[16:13] <[Coke]> ok, that has the instructions on testing, thanks.

[16:13] <[Coke]> so, +1 from me for putting it in raku/doc... maybe .../Languages/announcements?

[20:34] <finanalyst> [Coke] sorry for the delay. You still on line?

[20:35] <[Coke]> back

[20:35] <[Coke]> oh, wow. we're online at the same time! :)

[20:35] <finanalyst> :)

[20:36] <finanalyst> so, I thought that the best place would be immediately under doc

[20:36] <finanalyst> Language/ has a fair number of files under it

[20:37] <[Coke]> ok, fair

[20:39] <finanalyst> the only thing I havent done is to test bad or absent :date/:caption

[20:45] <finanalyst> [Coke] is the test version of announcements.rakudoc sufficient for the starting version?

[20:45] <finanalyst> only one =Note is needed, the others are more to provide some examples of what is possible

[20:52] <[Coke]> I would remove the announcement announcement and have the epub one sit for a few days before adding the ann. one back in

[20:59] <finanalyst> [Coke] sounds good. Shall I remove the Rakudo update?
