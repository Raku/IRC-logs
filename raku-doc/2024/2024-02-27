[21:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/invalid-wb-syntax: Remove invalid <|w> syntax

[21:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/invalid-wb-syntax: 

[21:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/invalid-wb-syntax: The docs currently refer to <|w> as a synonym for <?wb>, but this doesn't seem to be valid syntax – it's not spec'd in Roast, it isn't documented elsewhere, and it doesn't work in Raku AST. So this commit removes it from here.
