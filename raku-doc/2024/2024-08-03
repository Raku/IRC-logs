[20:56] <[Coke]> I see so many "an SQL" and want to fix them to be "a SQL" because it's "sequel" not "ess queue ell"

[21:15] <sjn> "a Structured Query Language statement"

[21:19] <[Coke]> I know that's technically correct, but I imagine the number of people saying in their head when they read it is very low. :)

[21:19] <sjn> isn't is just easier to look at the text and say "ah, the author means 'ess queue ell' in this case, since they used 'an' as the indefinite article"

[21:20] *** sena_kun left
[21:20] <sjn> (meaning both forms are correct, depending on how the word is pronounced)

[21:23] <sjn> (... pronounced by the author :)

[21:33] <[Coke]> "easier"?

[21:33] <[Coke]> I'm looking at it from an editorial standpoint, trying to clean up the grammar.

[21:34] <[Coke]> also writing a test to complain about improper "an"s to enforce half of the equation, so I need to pick a side.

[22:45] <sjn> ah, if you're the author, then you get to pick :-D

[22:45] <sjn> I for one (as a reader) can figure out your decision either way

[23:23] <coleman> I vote for "a SQL"
