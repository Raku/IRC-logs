[19:02] <coleman> I am testing a CI agent with the latest Rakudo

[19:02] <coleman> It's been a while since we upgraded the Rakudo version that builds the website. Over 6 months.

[19:30] <coleman> Build succeeded. But I need to try again after installing the syntax highlight tool https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/6259#019185c3-9cd7-44cb-869b-0cdd2d1fb629
