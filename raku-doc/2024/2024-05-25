[16:01] <[Coke]> ab5tract++!

[17:07] <ab5tract> I debated on including the term “dotty infix” in that text but couldn’t decide whether it helped or hindered readability .. do we have a general position on including colloquialisms or not?

[17:10] <[Coke]> Too much is too cute.

[17:11] <[Coke]> Smilies are included, fwiw.

[17:35] <ab5tract> Got it
