[16:14] <[Coke]> xt/rakudoc-types.rakutest has false negatives in the JS doc file, because we have things like C<Map> where that Map means the JS Map, not the Raku Map, we don't know that, so we complain that it's not formatted correctly.

[16:14] <[Coke]> Guessing the easiest way to fix that would be to link to the JS ones on someone else's doc site.
