[07:27] <patrickb> I think the idea of an update stream is fine. Just the initial  popup is problematic. I personally would keep the update page and add a single line banner teasing right below the top menu instead.

[11:26] <tbrowder> howdy, is this the place for RakuDoc-GAMMA discussion?

[11:30] <tbrowder> my question pod-gamma: can i use it now? with current Raku release?

[11:33] <tbrowder> next question: i want to us it to render to pdf, where should that fit into the pod-gamma repos?

[11:34] <tbrowder> *use it

[12:28] <[Coke]> patrickb: good suggestion.

[12:29] <[Coke]> These are questions that finanalyst is probably best to answer. Hoping lizmat might know.

[12:29] <[Coke]> er, for tbrowder ^^

[12:54] <tbrowder> i have successfully installed rakuast-rakudoc-render and started a PR. now i'm looking for the real, existing templates to work with...

[12:55] <[Coke]> nice.

[12:56] <tbrowder> btw, excited about raku conf in south carolina next, plan to attend ("God willing and the creek don't rise")

[12:57] <tbrowder> *next year

[12:59] <tbrowder> i've also asked Dr Raku to make a video on installing Raku/zef on Windows

[13:26] <[Coke]> south carolina is close enough for a long drive here.

[20:59] <tbrowder> when we lived in SC 1991-1993 downtown Greenville SC had just been revitalized and it had a new, great theater that regularly hosted big name traveling shows. my fav was a troupe from the New Orleans Preservation Hall jazz musicians.

[21:01] <coleman> My cousin got married in Greenville a few years back. Lovely place.
