[17:31] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/4bcbd5274b

[17:35] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4443 - complain that docs say list but functions return Seq - this is similar to the defined issue that just came up

[17:36] <[Coke]> Are we actually committing to returning just a Positional here?

[17:37] <lizmat> you mean, in the code, or in the documentation?
