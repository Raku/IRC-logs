[16:11] <tbrowder> i'm using the new RakAst RakuDoc and trying to get a dump of all rakudoc nodes in a Raku file and have had no luck so far.

[16:16] <tbrowder> lizmat: any way to do that? i try browsing the source code but don't see a common base class (which was a major problem imho in pod6). and i don't know how a reliable way to detect the end of a pod tree, i.e., a leaf node).

[16:16] <lizmat> what does:

[16:17] <lizmat> RAKUDO_RAKUST=1 raku --rakudoc filename.rakumod

[16:17] <lizmat> do for you ?

[16:19] <lizmat> afk&

[16:20] <tbrowder> i have to confirm when i get home, but when i feed it to the sub walk $node pointed to by [Coke] i get a lot of nodes that i can't interrogate with .^name

[16:23] <tbrowder> i have briefly tried $node.raku.say but of course that bombs on none defined nodes

[16:23] <tbrowder> afk&

[16:25] <[Coke]> can you point me at a sample file?

[16:26] <[Coke]> (that has the offending rakudoc?)

[16:32] <tbrowder> yes, as soon as i get my act together (tough to do with my scatter brain)...

[16:52] <tbrowder> ah the file is on https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory/docs/README.rakudoc

[16:55] <tbrowder> when i do what lizmat said to do, i notice the output looks like it may need some newlines. the current To::Markdown does a good job--output is as expected.

[16:58] <tbrowder> that file includes a couple tables and some notes

[17:43] <[Coke]> https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory/blob/master/docs/README.rakudoc

[17:44] <[Coke]> how recent a raku do we need to have for lizmat's one liner to do anything?

[17:45] <[Coke]> 2024.08 here, it is silent

[17:45] <tbrowder> yes, forgot the blob, sorry

[17:46] <tbrowder> hm, i’m using 2024.08

[17:48] <tbrowder> and can you tell me *again*, pls where yr orig walk sub is? i may have messed it up

[17:50] <tbrowder> i promise i’ll save it this time

[17:53] <tbrowder> um, let me see what i did with lizmat’s code…

[17:55] <tbrowder> i put her code inside a shell script

[17:56] <tbrowder> and it dumped the transformed txt to stdout

[18:04] <tbrowder> i’ll gist the script after i do the lunch cleanup (the price of living with an unpaid cook who insists on cooking  most every meal)

[18:06] <[Coke]> it's in raku/doc - here:

[18:07] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/xt/rakuast-validate.rakutest

[18:07] <[Coke]> (cleanup) nice problem to have, I guess! :)

[18:48] <tbrowder> whew, done. thnx for link. were you able to output with a shell script?

[19:07] <[Coke]> when I run lizmat's oneliner against your file, I get no output at all

[19:34] <tbrowder> bummer, for some reason my version of the doc:main wasn't fully synched--thinks it's okay now. trying the validate test...

[19:43] <tbrowder> well, not there yet, but i did something different when i told you i used a script. the script callled the pod file from my /dev directory so exec line inside the has a different path

[20:06] <tbrowder> arg, my doc dir is detached from rakudo so i think i need to restore the original repo...bye

[20:07] <tbrowder> raku, that is

[20:07] <tbrowder> whatever...

[20:48] <tbrowder> all right! got my module's rakudoc passing--needed 2 instances of V<> to pass

[20:48] <tbrowder> let's see what mi6 does with the fixes...

[22:03] *** sena_kun left
[22:57] <tbrowder> ok, i dropped the test file and Test-Pods module in my lib and xt dirs and it works fine.

[22:57] <tbrowder> now i’m going to try to do some debugging on those pod nodes

[23:44] <tbrowder> and, voila! every node has .^name defined, every node reports .raku with usable info! godd job, [Coke] and lizmat

[23:44] <tbrowder> *good

[23:44] <[Coke]> \o/
