[07:13] <patrickb> Coke: There are three PRs on the Cro-http repo that should fix the instability you observe with Cro http client. They are basically only blocked on review. If you want you could just patch your local copy with those changes. (All three PRs by me).

[07:14] <patrickb> Also maybe related, I'm currently working on fixing both the instability and performance of http::tiny. Ideally it'll be done in a week or two.
