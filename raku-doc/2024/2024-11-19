[20:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: I'm not 100% sure this commit will work smoothly as is. One change (or was it two?) involved what looks like meta information related to search indexes. I'm not familiar with that stuff. I did a mechanical translation and guessed it was likely it would work if there was an index entry for `<?wb>`. But maybe I misunderstand. And anyway, I don't know how to test it short of getting into setting up a whole doc testing s

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: 

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: While `<|w>` works in Rakudo, it isn't official Raku, and while I personally like it, there's a chance it will go away. Its semantics are the same as `<?wb>`, which _is_ official Raku, so I've switched to that. (See also https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/5c1a147e68e800a35baea3505f4cdc14fee63efa.)

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: 

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: I meant my prior related commit (which changed the regex doc page) to be a PR because I wasn't 100% sure about the `X<...>` stuff and regardless of that I felt it could still do with a quick check by someone else. But I clicked the wrong button. Otoh, once I'd done that I thought it would almost certainly work and be wanted, and if it didn't it wouldn't be a big deal and would be easy for me to spot it even 

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: 

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-2: But for _this_ change I'm making sure I do it as a PR. I still expect it to work, but it may not, and the consequence of that might be a waste of others' time, and even if it does it might not be wanted.
