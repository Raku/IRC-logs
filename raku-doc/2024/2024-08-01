[13:59] <[Coke]> We have several cases where one of the coercion methods, e.g. C<Str> is in the docs, but my first-pass test is complaining because it thinks it should be L<C<Str>|/type/Str>

[14:01] <[Coke]> I have been trying to avoid referring to /routine, but I think the methods can probably all go to:

[14:02] <[Coke]> /type/Foo#Str or generically /routine/Str - we can check for either of those forms and consider those a valid link. Any thoughts?

[14:30] <[Coke]> For something like the js-nutshell page, where we're referring to the Map in JS, is this OK? C<MapZ<>>

[14:31] <[Coke]> ah, that is rendered as MapZ<>, so no.

[14:33] <[Coke]> we can specify aribtrary tags on a block, I wonder if we should consider it for markup tags.

[14:33] <[Coke]> C<Map :ok>

[14:44] <[Coke]> I might have to do something like Z<type-ok>C<Map>

[14:45] <[Coke]> but that's a PITA>
