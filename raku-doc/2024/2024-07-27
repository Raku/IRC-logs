[21:23] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: addresses issue in #401 whitelists all links with typegraphs

[21:23] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[21:23] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - all typegraph headings have an id of typegraphrelations

[21:23] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - if a target contains this, the target is passed

[21:23] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - it will not work if the target is in an external file, so this test is too broad, but given the rarity of such a link, I think this fix is the best use of time

[21:34] <[Coke]> ... With that, I think all the broken links on the error report are fixed (leaving only the links to missing docs)

[21:34] <[Coke]> We'll get an updated report in 30m or so

[21:42] <[Coke]> That effort also found a few new TODOs for me to focus on.
