[20:43] <coleman> docs-dev.raku.org is returning 503

[20:43] <coleman> prod is okay. Looking into dev

[20:46] *** [Coke]_ is now known as [Coke]

[20:48] <coleman> Container is running. Maybe container itself has a bug. Checking.

[20:51] <coleman> Latest image seems fine.

[20:53] <coleman> LB shows the error. So LB is what is not routing. https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects/2106628/loadbalancers/1116722/targets

[20:58] <coleman> DNS is pointing at it (via CF proxy) so that's all good... continuing to poke around.

[21:07] <coleman> A direct port scan shows the server is up and the port is open. I'm rebooting the server now.

[21:07] <coleman> Not a software bug for us. :-/

[21:14] <coleman> Okay a `dnf update` and reboot fixed it.

[21:15] <coleman> I do not know why, but I'm inclined to patch prod now, too

[21:24] <coleman> Prod has been patched.
