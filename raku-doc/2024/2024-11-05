[20:15] <coleman> patrickb: assuming Richard's latest commit truly uses Rainbow, this webpage is using it https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/operators#Operator_classification

[20:31] <patrickb> Yes, that's Rainbow highlighting. I recognize the bugs. :-P

[20:42] <coleman> Well done, in any case. I'm inclined to merge just to get rid of the npm dependency.

[20:43] <coleman> If we can really remove one more reason to use node, that's huge

[21:19] <patrickb> o/

[21:20] <coleman> finanalyst: you can push to docs-dev branch and it will be deployed again. I have deployed your dev branch.

[21:21] <patrickb> I'm all for replacing the npm dep. I would have preferred the RakuAST deparse based highlighter. But IIUC it's not ready for prime time yet.

[21:21] <patrickb> o/ finanalyst

[21:24] <coleman> where and how should people file bugs for Rainbow?

[21:39] <patrickb> https://todo.sr.ht/~patrickb/Rainbow

[21:43] <coleman> Got it, thank you :)

[21:45] <patrickb> Yeah, the linking is suboptimal on sr.ht. The uplinks from the ticket/list/git/... sites up to the project hub are missing. It's on their evergrowing todo list...
