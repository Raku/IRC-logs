[14:36] <[Coke]> we have had some failures in rakuast vs. classic pod to text generation for a while, I need to determine if we're going to allowlist it.

[16:01] <coleman> I need to upgrade CI to latest rakudo because I think we are pretty out of date. Just FYI if you're getting failures on any features from the past few months 

[16:07] <[Coke]> CI doesn't run any of the xt tests yet, I don't think

[16:07] <[Coke]> (which is good because there are some failures)
