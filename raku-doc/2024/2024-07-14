[00:39] <[Coke]> did https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/5810 kick off a build? doesn't look like error-report was updated.

[00:39] <[Coke]> er, a deploy?

[16:04] <coleman> The buildkite-agent is running but it is having trouble connecting to the server

[16:04] <coleman> restarting

[16:07] <coleman> seems good now

[17:42] <[Coke]> ok - error-report was not regen'd by that, will try another docs-dev commit to poke it

[17:56] <[Coke]> TIL about git -C

[17:56] <[Coke]> ... Wow, that would have saved me some effort in a raku script I wrote to checkout all the git repos in an azdo project.

[17:57] <[Coke]> ok. https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/5820 completed... does this result in a deploy?

[17:57] <lizmat> heh... will need to remember that for App::Rak --show-blame option :-)

[18:09] <[Coke]> ok, it hasn't updated the website by now either. Coleman, how do I get an update to date build of the site (not just the latest docs) to deploy to docs-dev? I've been pushing changes to raku/doc:main, then doing a whitespace change on raku/doc-website:docs-dev

[18:09] <[Coke]> Is there a buildkite pipeline i need to trigger? something else?

[18:10] * [Coke] will try to do a local build, I guess.

[18:11] <[Coke]> oh, I think I missed the "then every 30m a deploy is done", and that's not tracked on buildkite.

[18:48] <[Coke]> would really like a way to monitor that "every 30m" bit.

[18:48] <[Coke]> I'm not seeing my expected changes yet.

[18:48] <[Coke]> So I am sure I'm missing some step here.

[18:52] <coleman> the tag was updated https://quay.io/repository/colemanx/raku-doc-website?tab=tags

[18:53] <coleman> checking the site

[18:57] <[Coke]> The shas at https://docs-dev.raku.org/about seem to be correct.

[18:59] <[Coke]> so I was expecting error-report to be much shorter. I'll try to find an explicit one that doesn't seem right, maybe I didn't fix what I thought.

[21:00] <[Coke]> ARGH. So the first of the bad links I checked, it was still really a bad link I hadn't fixed. Figures!
