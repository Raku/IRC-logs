[15:43] <[Coke]> Those were all found with the new test I'm working on that isn't quite ready to be committed.

[18:57] <[Coke]> how do folks feel about "an @", "an &", "an =" ? does it literally depend for you on how you prounce the character?

[22:33] <[Coke]> Warning: there are still 36 failing files on that xt/an-grammar.rakutest file, but I figure I'm the only one that runs it regularly.

[22:33] <[Coke]> the updated test let me also complain about "a unused thing", not just "an thing"

[22:35] <[Coke]> Any feedback on this test welcome.

[22:37] <[Coke]> I am rapidly getting to cases where the 'a' is something like my @a = < a e o> in code and may end up adding a skip for things are just painful to rewrite.
