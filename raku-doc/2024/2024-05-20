[13:44] <[Coke]> Any comments so far on the huge formatting update?

[13:45] <[Coke]> Will probably finish all the main types today, next is probably to standardize what links look like for methods, routines, and type objects.

[13:45] <[Coke]> I really wish I was more of a vi wizard, would make this easier. :)

[13:46] <[Coke]> Also fixing links to exceptions/AST nodes are highlighting missing docs.

[14:14] <lizmat> [Coke]++

[15:03] <[Coke]> also: lots of places say things like "An Exception object", when I think "An Exception" is fine?

[15:12] <lizmat> yeah,  you don't say "integer object" when it's about 42

[17:40] <[Coke]> I thought I was almost done. I was only looking in doc/Type so far, oof
