[11:46] <Geth> ¦ doc: tbrowder++ created pull request #4527: add PDF version of the rakuguide

[11:46] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4527

[12:06] <tbrowder> .tell [Coke] there it is, ready for use and linking.

[15:00] <[Coke]> I'm not installing someone else's rendered content on docs.raku.org

[15:00] <[Coke]> You need to reach out to the raku.guide people, have them host it, then we can link to their PDF

[15:01] <[Coke]> (not without a discussion, anyway)

[15:07] <[Coke]> (otherwise we have to consider that we'll get bug reports on their content, explain that it isn't ours and here's their content license, etc.)

[15:56] <[Coke]> Anyone else have some thoughts on that? I'm think getting a PDF of both sites available for users is a great idea, just want to put it where it makes sense (to me)
