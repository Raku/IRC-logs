[02:49] * sjn looks at the documentation for sort(), and wonders why the default sort method isn't made clear. It says "smallest element first", which isn't useful, really. Smallest in what sense?

[02:51] <sjn> I'd at least expect is say "by default, the elements are sorted alphabetically" or asciibetical, or alphanumerical, or whatever is the case

[02:54] <sjn> I guess it _can_ be figured out by exploring implications of how cmp() works, but it would be a whole lot more accessible to just spell it out where the behaviour is made use of...
