[16:36] <[Coke]> our CI tests don't run tests if doc/ didn't change.

[16:36] <[Coke]> which makes it annoying to test changes to lib/, t/, or xt/

[16:39] <[Coke]> (made a change, assume it passes, will delete it and force push and then merge to master)

[16:47] <sena_kun> can we change the logic?

[16:57] <[Coke]> Probably. I see now that the test is running that we're running with a progress bar indicator, which we don't want on a CI run

[16:58] <[Coke]> (generates a ton of output that will never be helpful to anyone looking at the output)

[17:00] <sena_kun> I agree with tests, but lib/ should go away in the future, by the way

[17:00] <sena_kun> no news about CEO, by the way?

[17:00] <sena_kun> oops, sorry, SEO

[17:00] <sena_kun> this weekend I'll present a talk more or less explaining the overall structure transition

[17:07] <lizmat> sena_kun: will you be doing it live ??   just wondering  :-)

[17:09] <sena_kun> I hope to record it tbh, but the deadline was yesterday, so you can tell I'm in a real pinch rn. : )

[17:09] <sena_kun> too many things need my attention at once and this one is one of many with strict deadlines.

[17:11] <lizmat> I think Andrew will prefer a recording in any case 

[17:11] <lizmat> much less issues with bandwidth

[17:12] <sena_kun> yes, true

[17:12] <sena_kun> a lot better for me also, less "eeh, ugh, how was this word again, eeeh", so let's hope I'll do it in time
