[20:04] <[Coke]> I have the documentation build instructions; there are a few items where a particular version/os is recommended, and they are slightly different than the README instructions on the documentable steps. I'll work on that this weekend a bit. the instruction also refer to the old-docs branch; so once we can successfully build that, we can revisit the master changes to see what needs to be adjusted there for 

[20:05] <[Coke]> a successful build.

[20:06] <[Coke]> for any new build paths: devops needs something where they can do a build in a docker container and then handoff to a runtime container with the results of that build.
