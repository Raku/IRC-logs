[10:06] <sena_kun> o/

[10:07] <sena_kun> what's the time of the meeting this weekend? I looked at the wiki (https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki#meeting) but couldn't find time?

[11:46] <sena_kun> [Coke], coleman yo! You might be interested in reading https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/c15e580480d44616eace320ccda95ed3 <- ideas welcome.

[12:03] <sena_kun> https://gist.github.com/antoniogamiz/9f7feb5b93a95d0c121ec0ba03d28b6a?permalink_comment_id=3399287#secondary-urls <- here is the explanation of how secondary pages are generated and it's matching the implementation. as to why the pages are used: for routines they help to see how the method changes depending on the invocant. There are no URLs in the search for `/reference` at all, and for `/syntax` when there is a single paragraph taken out it is maybe a 

[12:03] <sena_kun> good idea to gracefully deprecate them (i.e. redirect to parent page relevant bit).

[12:14] <sena_kun> [Coke], I need feedback related to if it's a good idea to actually implement the changes suggested to proceed.

[13:28] <[Coke]> noon eastern again was my plan

[13:35] <lizmat> which would be 18:00 UTC, right ?

[13:35] <lizmat> aka 20:00 for most of western europe (except UK/Ireland)

[13:44] <[Coke]> I thought it was 16 UTC

[13:46] <lizmat> ah, yes...

[13:47] <lizmat> so I got it wrong in the weekly

[13:48] <[Coke]> Sorry, will use UTC going forward.

[13:49] <[Coke]> just to avoid confusion

[15:21] <sena_kun> so 16:00 UTC next Saturday, roger.

[15:23] <[Coke]> (y)

[15:23] <[Coke]> depending on your language settings, "this" Saturday, not "next" Saturday. :)

[15:24] <[Coke]> 3 days from now

[15:24] <sena_kun> true, yes

[15:24] <sena_kun> is the channel logged?

[15:24] <[Coke]> english is sehr confusing.

[15:25] <sena_kun> I wonder if my messages about search URLs were seen

[15:25] <[Coke]> Yes, liz is logging it with everything else.

[15:27] <sena_kun> awwww, dammit

[15:27] <sena_kun> it seems I'll have another meeting that time. :/

[15:28] <sena_kun> I'll prepare and send notes about what's done / what's the blockers then.

[17:50] <coleman> I am loathe to put more administrative work on someone, but I'd love a raku-docs mailing list

[17:50] <coleman> sena_kun: I will check out that link, thnx

[17:53] <coleman> I do use an IRC bouncer and it seems to work, so I usually get notifications

[17:54] <coleman> "seems" and "usually" are my qualifiers, because, hey, it's IRC :)

[18:05] <coleman> [Coke] sena_kun - I have created a wiki page for the agenda of the upcoming meeting.

[18:05] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Meeting:-2022-07-09

[18:06] <coleman> Please feel free to edit it. I only have one concrete item right now.

[18:07] <coleman> oh and cc lizmat too 

[18:07] <lizmat> not making any promises, have a visitor on Sat

[18:15] <coleman> No big deal :)

[18:49] <[Coke]> mailing list - we haven't been able to update perl6-users to raku-users in years, so we're a little behind on mailing list todos
