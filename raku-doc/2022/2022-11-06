[16:07] <Nemokosch> do yall have a JS framework you like or have experience with?

[16:08] <Nemokosch> I concluded that the JS code of the new site (the autocomplete feature of search, in particular) is too much spaghetti for me to work with it

[16:09] <Nemokosch> and if I'm rewriting it, perhaps options other than jQuery can also be considered

[18:46] <patrickb> Nemokosch: In my experience is THW price one pays for using a framework in the JS world quite high: added complexity in the build pipeline, during debugging and - with most frameworks - a rather high churn leaving you with an old version sooner than you wish.

[18:47] <patrickb> So in general I recommend to try to stay vanilla if feasible then use the simplest framework fitting the bill.

[21:03] <coleman> +1 for vanilla JS to start with, or at least start with non-SPA (single page application) JS

[21:49] <Nemokosch> It definitely won't be SPA, I don't think we should just ditch the whole Cro-oriented architecture

[21:50] <Nemokosch> There are two motives I'm coming from

[21:53] <Nemokosch> 1. the current search.js implementation (based on jQuery with a widget) is, sorry to say, horrible. Hard to reason about, hard to change, demotivating to work with.

[21:54] <Nemokosch> 2. I'm also not fond of the idea to write a similar categorized auto-completion feature from scratch in vanilla JS. If somebody has (a decent) one, I have nothing against it.

[21:56] <Nemokosch> I might still like that idea more than to keep it as it is now but I would be really happy to use a lightweight framework with better defaults or documentation than this jQuery UI widget

[21:56] <Nemokosch> or even just rewrite it with this widget in a saner way
