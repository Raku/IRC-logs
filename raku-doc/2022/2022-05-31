[18:46] <coleman> I've put this build on a schedule https://buildkite.com/de-limited/docs-dot-raku-dot-org/builds/13

[18:46] <coleman> This is my personal server so it can't be the authoritative CI, but I'll keep it running as long as I'm helping with docs.

[18:58] <lizmat> coleman++   should I mention that in the next weekly?

[19:00] <coleman> You know what? Let's not. What's more important is my Reddit post about deployment. 

[19:00] <coleman> Ah, hell. Go ahead :) Link to it :)

[19:01] <coleman> If you link to the Buildkite CI, also link to the Packer build that creates the container that the CI runs in https://git.de.limited/coleman/raku-site-builds

[19:03] <coleman> Buildkite is $9/user per month. Which can add up for teams. But I love the paradigm of 1) they host the UI and the build queue, and 2) the actual builds execute inside my server

[19:03] <coleman> It's quite customizable

[19:03] <coleman> I am always doing something gnarly with my builds, so highly-standardized tools like CircleCI annoy me :D

[19:04] <coleman> This is the reddit post. I'm final_bawse on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/v19zyw/how_do_you_deploy_your_code_no_docker/

[19:05] <lizmat> coleman: I'll check again on Sun/Monday ok?

[19:05] <coleman> Sounds good. Feel free to msg me

[19:09] <lizmat> oki
