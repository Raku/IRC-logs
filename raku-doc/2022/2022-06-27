[05:44] <patrickb> oh. I was using http://164.90.207.89:10010/

[05:45] <patrickb> I'm on Android 10 using Firefox (Chrome bahaves the same).

[08:26] <patrickb> I now tried on desktop as well. using 164.90.207.89:10010. Typing "garbage-col" into the search bar shows a "Not found, but you can try site search" which shows the correct link on hover over but does nothing when clicked.

[08:27] <patrickb> When typing in "garbage-col" followed by a press of Return, google opens up but searches for "garbage".

[08:29] <patrickb> Desktop chrome shows the same behavior.

[08:30] <patrickb> I never had the page open in Chrome before, so the files can't be stale.

[09:11] <sena_kun> wut

[09:12] <sena_kun> uzl[m], I don't know anything about the URL you sent, so unless it points to the :10010 address it might be outdated.

[09:12] <sena_kun> but yes, I can reproduce it, that's... weird.

[09:23] <sena_kun> ah, I see what's wrong
