[18:17] <coleman> i recommend using nvm for all node installations, as long as the processes you are running can run under your $USER

[18:29] <coleman> I'm going to create a wiki page for the September meeting agenda; we can add the specific date when it's known

[18:36] <coleman> Here is a blank agenda for a September meeting https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Meeting:-2022-09-%3F%3F-(date-TBD)

[18:37] <coleman> date TBD
