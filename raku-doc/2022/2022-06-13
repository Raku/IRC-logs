[10:30] <patrickb> Weren't you on vacation?

[10:46] <sena_kun> well, I was, but the way back was terrible (had to have a flight in the evening, changing the airports took a whole night and then another flight, adding up to like 30 hours without sleep at all) and now I seem to have some weird state of a cold but not really cold.

[10:46] <sena_kun> there were some nice things for sure and I'll remember them later, forgetting how I feel now, but still I'm not refreshed, but exhausted.

[10:52] <patrickb> Ouch. Then recover well!

[13:57] <[Coke]> oof
