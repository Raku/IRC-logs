[13:55] <patrickb> [Coke]: I've been using the new docs site exclusively for quite a while now.

[13:57] <patrickb> Pretty much the only thing I've noticed is that the overlay left menu can cause confusion on mobile devices, because I didn't realize that it could be and had to be retracted to actually see the content.

[13:58] <patrickb> Maybe a fix could be to have the menu auto-retract or start retracted, once the screen is small enough so the menu starts to overlay the content.

[16:46] <[Coke]> in my continuing may adventures, will be offline a bit mid week, mostly wednesday.

[16:51] <[Coke]> patrickb: if you can make sure there's a ticket that reflects that on https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/issues, that would be helpful

[16:53] * sena_kun just fixed 3 simpler tickets and deploying in progress

[16:54] <sena_kun> in a better version of reality I'd took a look at what to do with support of the invalid URLs of the old website and the Documentable PR
