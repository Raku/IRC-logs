[00:39] <NemokoschKiwi> oh I missed quite a lot

[00:41] <NemokoschKiwi> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4160 - this has already been mentioned

[00:42] <NemokoschKiwi> I'm defo biased here because I feel the "decont pseudo-operator" hurt me rather than helped me with my understanding... BUT

[00:43] <NemokoschKiwi> I see a problem with this thinking pattern of "I wish I have seen this easier --> the docs need to be adapted"

[00:48] <NemokoschKiwi> not saying this is a desperately serious problem but probably it's good to be on one page with this

[00:50] <NemokoschKiwi> if there is one and only one documentation, it inevitably won't be equally convenient for everyone. Perhaps it would be good to have some declared non-technical goal

[00:56] <NemokoschKiwi> ehh... sounds like something to be added to the discussions :D

[14:08] <[Coke]> "one and only one" as opposed to one for 6.c, one for 6.d? Yes. I think we need to start with one (among other reasons, the amount of effort it would take to do even a second version), and once we have the *data* to support showing one vs. the other, we can consider the technical effort of generating different versions of the docs.

[14:09] <[Coke]> because there isn't just raku versions, but also rakudo releases, and backend issues, and bugs..

[14:09] <[Coke]> and we have each of those noted in various places in the docs.

[14:10] <[Coke]> when we have a per-verison change in something like a tutorial, that's a much better argument to have a separate version.

[17:33] <coleman> Who owns the raku.org domain?

[17:34] <coleman> The Foundation?

[17:34] <coleman> Or a friendly community member?

[21:52] <[Coke]> dunno, sorry, ask in raku?

[22:37] <Nemokosch> Ah no, I meant something even more banal

[22:37] <Nemokosch> it's not "one for you, one for me"

[22:43] <Nemokosch> diversity that comes from Raku versions or even Rakudo versions, that's a legitimate challenge

[22:43] <Nemokosch> but regarding the goal, well... that's the thing exactly. There should be one goal. Not less, not more.

[22:44] <[Coke]> if someone wants to setup a competing site, i'd ask them to just try to infiltrate our org instead.

[22:47] <Nemokosch> Honestly, I don't think that would happen, simply because it's really a horrendous amount of work...

[22:48] <Nemokosch> I brought it up because of that decont issue where we had pretty much oppositional views with Rob (perhaps Steve as well) regarding the direction of the change itself
