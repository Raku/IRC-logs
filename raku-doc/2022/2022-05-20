[13:08] <[Coke]> Back. looks like my home internet cut out so many times while I was gone as to be non-existant.

[13:09] <[Coke]> Still on for the call tomorrow - did I read somewhere that Altai-man can't make it? 

[13:09] <Altai-man> o/

[13:09] <Altai-man> [Coke], I think you're right.

[13:09] <[Coke]> (such a long week, can't remember the last time I traveled for work, then 2 trips in 2 weeks)

[13:10] <Altai-man> ugh, that's a lot

[13:10] <[Coke]> ok. So for you, we're looking for volunteers to test and report out/open tickets

[13:11] <[Coke]> also: when I got home last night: there was a hungry bear in my back yard.

[13:11] * Altai-man will have like 3 train rides and 5 flights at the end of the month

[13:12] <Altai-man> what, a bear..?

[13:12] <[Coke]> I live in the suburbs, next to an "ever wild" section of forest. Didn't realize there was a bear in there. :)

[13:13] <Altai-man> sounds dangerous, yet I value the idea

[13:14] <[Coke]> btw, "ever wild" means "won't sell this strip of land to developers"

[19:34] <coleman> I have just recently installed an IRC bouncer on a cloud server. It's making things a bit nicer. IRC is still a bit difficult for me, though.

[19:38] <[Coke]> yup. it's the worst, but it's everywhere.

[20:33] <[Coke]> . o O (clear)

[20:35] <patrickb> I'll be on the road tomorrow evening (I'm utc+2), but I'll try if it's possible to connect via mobile. We'll see if I manage to do that.

[23:01] <[Coke]_> Thankfully I have cell service that is better than the home 5G service, so I should still be able to make the call tomorrow
