[15:23] <Nemokosch> Well well. Another example of how communication is key. Talking for myself, I have little to no idea what Roman was doing - I knew that he was doing something, and that it probably costed not just time but money as well.

[15:24] <Nemokosch> And now, kinda suddenly, it strucks that this is over - and we still don't know what the tasks are :\

[15:26] <Nemokosch> Anyway, I'd be optimistic. I can try to host a version of that site with CI on my VPS (there have been some updates since the published version by Oleksandr)

[15:28] <Nemokosch> And I definitely wouldn't be worried that we don't have anything to work on. It's another thing who wants to contribute to what... there are the document issues as usual; some work on the new docs site I'd like to get done, then there is raku.org...

[15:29] <Nemokosch> Yes, I know raku.org is not documentation per se but as I might have said - there doesn't seem to be anything like "raku website team", lol. And it's definitely a question of content as well, not just "infrastructure"

[15:31] <Nemokosch> I'm trying to continue with what I pretentiously call "project mowyw6", i.e I want to migrate the templates from mowyw to a Template6-based solution. It's just... Template6 isn't documented all that well, and it doesn't fully cover TT2

[15:31] <Nemokosch> If I fail, I can still migrate to TT2 at least, I guess
