[19:07] <coleman> Nice talk submission :) https://conf.raku.org/talk/177

[19:07] <[Coke]> I have a loop that could start one or two Proc::Async items, but may skip either on any given iteration; can I still use the react {whenever} syntax? can I wrap the whenever block inside an if in the react?

[19:07] <[Coke]> ww

[19:54] <sena_kun> speaking of the talk, I think the last blocker for the website to go live was fixed last weekend, but from here I'm not sure how to proceed.

[19:55] <sena_kun> cc [Coke] coleman patrickb ^

[19:56] <patrickb> The question of where to host isn't resolved yet, right?

[19:58] <coleman> Thanks for the update 

[19:58] <coleman> sena_kun++

[19:58] <patrickb> sena_kun++ indeed

[19:58] <sena_kun> patrickb, you mean the domain or the host itself? I thought we had some infra-related people and a server, no?

[19:59] <coleman> There are details to work out. Let's start a wiki page that can anchor a discussion about deployment

[19:59] <coleman> unless one already exists in which case we can edit that

[19:59] <patrickb> The host. I think we do. But as always time is sparse. Especially the time of others...

[20:00] <sena_kun> true

[20:01] <patrickb> I'm currently setting up the rakudo CI bot on my own server infrastructure so not to be blocked by waiting for the official infrastructure to find its way...

[20:02] <sena_kun> afk for an hour

[20:02] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Production-Environment

[20:02] <coleman> If the existing hosts are willing to keep hosting the docs site, then our goal will be to conform to their needs.

[20:03] <coleman> 1. how they want things named, packaged 2. release cadence, notifications, etc. 3. automation possibility and capabilities

[20:04] <coleman> We can also start an issue for asynchronous discussion, unless one exists

[20:04] <coleman> but overall very exciting!

[22:15] <[Coke]> (what do I mean) ok to merge it

[22:27] <coleman> I do not have permission to do so

[22:34] <[Coke]> oops

[22:35] <[Coke]> done
