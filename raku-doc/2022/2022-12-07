[12:58] <tbrowder> [Coke]: note if my new doc issue is dized, and the two PRs are accepted, it will give me a cleaner file to tell me MY errors for the original "instrospection-example" [sic] PR. that aspell.t UTF-8 error has been there a long time.

[13:38] <tbrowder>  s/dized/fixed/; <= really getting bad....

[14:35] <[Coke]> I saw the bug for the xt test - was going to see if I could duplicate it on your branch

[14:35] <[Coke]> One of the two was trivial, done. The other one I needed to actually read.

[15:12] <[Coke]> the remaining one somehow has a conflict already

[15:41] <[Coke]> tbrowder: the section categories were an issue before you - you don't have to fix those as part of your changes, but thank you if you do. (that's the PR that has a conflict somehow)

[16:10] <tbrowder> okay, thnx, i probably got some overlap in my rush. i’m looking on another host to see if that’s an issue.

[16:12] <[Coke]> regarding your utf8 issue, let me know which branch you're seeing this on

[16:12] <[Coke]> I can see if it's the branch or the tooling.

[16:12] <[Coke]> (maybe our aspells aren't compatible, e.g.)

[16:23] <tbrowder> ok, first item: i see the conflict and can fix it. second item: utf8 i’m looking at another host as well as other branches.

[18:50] <[Coke]> uhoh, my new network provider just dropped for 4m.

[18:51] <[Coke]> (they've been great since I switched over until that)

[20:11] <tbrowder> it’s apparently only my one local host with the aspell problem, trying to narrow that down.

[20:12] <tbrowder> i think i fixed the the git conflict on the fix-xref PR
