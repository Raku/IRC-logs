[16:00] <stevied34> when I try doing `make init-highlight` per the docs, I get a bunch of node errors

[16:01] <stevied34> sorry, `make init-highlights`

[16:02] *** stevied34 left
[16:12] <[Coke]> As I recall, there is a very specific version of node that was required for that step - we are in progress on moving to a new UI; sena_kun, does the new UI rely on the same highlighter?

[16:13] <stevied> ok. should I use the container? I didn't have any success figuring out how to use the container.

[16:14] <sena_kun> [Coke], I'm not sure about the "exact" version bit as I never saw the problems myself, but I saw such claims, yes

[16:14] <sena_kun> stevied, which one do you want, the new website or the old one?

[16:14] <sena_kun> [Coke], while everyone are here, can you schedule a meeting?

[16:14] <sena_kun> : )

[16:14] <stevied> I didn't realize there was a new one

[16:15] <[Coke]> next weekend is bad for me. anyone else have restrictions this month?

[16:16] <stevied> I'm just mostly fooling around with this trying to learn how it's supposed to work. I've successfully created a one big pdf from all the docs that I put on the ipad but it has some issues (many links don't work, for example)

[16:17] <stevied> what I'd really like to do is be able to generate the docs that are suitable for use as an ebook and sell it and donate proceeds to raku

[16:19] <stevied> it's nice to be able to markup the document with my pencil and take notes on it

[16:20] <[Coke]> We did have the 'build a giant page' working years ago, but it fell into disrepair. Getting an ebook-ready format is in the backlog. If you'd like to take that on, more power to you.

[16:21] <[Coke]> I suspect you'd be better off doing it using a similar build mechanism (but different render target) rather than trying to render a single page and then converting that to an e-book, but I don't know for sure

[16:21] <[Coke]> anyway, welcome !

[16:21] <stevied> I would like to take it on but I'm probably in over my head and would have to spend months on the project

[16:21] <[Coke]> Join the club. :)

[16:23] <stevied> the giant page feature does work, for the most part. it's usable when running on a server. Then I printed it to a PDF and added it to Apple's Books app. It works. But many of the links are now broken.

[16:24] <stevied> it's still better than nothing, though

[16:25] <stevied> I also exported to .epub and opened with an open source piece of software call calibre, but that's less usable.

[16:25] <stevied> the .epub version did not open at all on the apple books app. and when I tried to send it to my kindle device on my mac, it choked for some reason and didn't work.

[16:32] <stevied> by the way, the docs are 939 pages, not including the index on the left. with the index it's 1001 pages long

[16:34] <stevied> the index is the list of hyperlinks on the left hand side that links to each section of the doc

[16:57] <stevied> so what was the idea behind https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/perl6-doc?

[16:58] <stevied> when I run that container, I'm seeing docs from 3 years ago

[16:58] <sena_kun> well, it gives you the Dockerfile you can build on your own?

[16:58] <sena_kun> that's if you want the old website

[16:59] <sena_kun> you can take a look at https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/

[17:14] *** sena_kun left
[17:20] <stevied> ok, interesting. thanks

[17:24] <lizmat> hmmm.. now that we have a raku-duc channel, maybe Geth should post commits etc here as well as on #raku ?

[17:24] <lizmat> *doc

[17:29] *** Geth joined
[17:30] <lizmat> ok, commits to the doc repo will now also be reported here...  please let me know if you *do* feel this to be inconvenient
