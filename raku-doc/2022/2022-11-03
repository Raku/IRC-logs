[12:50] <Nemokosch> Hello, I'm trying to push docs site issues a little bit. About to open a new one about search, hopefully I can look into it myself.

[12:53] <[Coke]> Yes, please.

[12:53] <[Coke]> (pushing, not necessarily self-solving)

[12:53] <[Coke]> (but that also: great)

[12:56] <Nemokosch> It's great that I can host the site and it seems to work now

[12:56] <Nemokosch> Also: what do we know about the state of the infrastructure part?

[12:58] <[Coke]> Last I heard, sena-kun was pushing that with infra team (which I had been going to do but never followed through, glad he did so!)

[12:58] <[Coke]> sena_kun, lizmat: do you know if there's an email thread for that with infra?

[12:59] <[Coke]> (if so, please add me)

[12:59] <[Coke]> Also: did folks find the monthly meetings useful? If so, let's plan for one this November, say the 19th?

[13:01] <sena_kun> I did

[13:01] <sena_kun> find them useful, I mean

[13:02] <sena_kun> [Coke], if you want to be cc to the emails, can you send me your email please?

[13:04] <Nemokosch> in theory, it should be useful :) I think more interactions would help with many project management things, even in a voluntary effort

[13:13] <[Coke]> will@coleda.com

[13:13] <[Coke]> ok, so let's do the 19th at .. 11AM Eastern time? (dst change this weekend, I think)

[13:14] <sena_kun> Should work for me.

[13:14] <sena_kun> I just CC'd you the emails.

[13:15] <[Coke]> sena_kun++ Thank you for moving forward on this and not relying on me, seriously, not kidding.

[13:21] <[Coke]> thanks for the cc, appreciate it.

[17:37] <Nemokosch> sena_kun: what you called "weird UX" is the current behavior of the site :P

[17:38] <Nemokosch> not only does enter open the hovered element but enters the last hovered element even when it states it would open something else

[17:38] <Nemokosch> s/enters/enter opens/

[17:50] <sena_kun> Nemokosch, wait, did I misread the ticket?

[17:51] <sena_kun> oh, I did

[17:51] <sena_kun> Nemokosch, yes, it should be fixed

[17:52] <sena_kun> I'll update the comment now..

[17:59] <Nemokosch> oh gotcha

[17:59] *** Kaipii joined
[17:59] <Nemokosch> I think the answer should lie somewhere in the followLink function in search.js

[18:01] <sena_kun> hope to get more motivation once it's sailed

[18:04] <Nemokosch> fair...
