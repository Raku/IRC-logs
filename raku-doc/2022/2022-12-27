[10:03] <Nemokosch> That's what you would naively think and that's what would make sense. But actually that's not the case.

[10:08] <Nemokosch> at this point, the only thing I can imagine could theoretically work, is some mass email to whoever I can find on public places. The IRC channel is too messy to not get carried away; Github spaces are way too dead; I tend to avoid Reddit - but for the record, it also seems rather quiet, apart from guifa and raiph maybe - and the rest are definitely not suited for this sort of topics

[17:15] <coleman> Altai-man and [Coke] - what do you think of this https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/issues/83#issuecomment-1366054808

[17:15] <coleman> I'm willing to work on setting up a deployment framework in Altai-man's repo

[17:16] <coleman> The goal being to create something that anyone can use if they have ssh keys

[17:16] <coleman> is there duplicate effort going on somewhere?

[17:16] <coleman> The latest RSC minutes mention potential infra volunteers but don't name names

[17:16] <coleman> reply on the issue and I'll see it. thnx

[17:16] <coleman> :)

[18:05] <Altai-man> coleman, replied

[18:23] <coleman> Thank you.

[18:25] <coleman> lizmat: If you can put me in touch with the right people I am willing to help with infra, especially to get the new docs site online. I think it will be transformative!

[18:26] <coleman> I can be emailed at coleman@de.limited and my GitHub username is dontlaugh

[18:26] <coleman> if you would like to have a video chat, I am in the Eastern US and can probably get overlap with Western Europe without much trouble.

[18:46] <lizmat> coleman: thank you
