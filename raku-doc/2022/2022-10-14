[14:55] <Nemokosch> Hello

[14:56] <Nemokosch> I think it would be worth pointing out somewhere in the docs that %?RESOURCES is only available in the lib/ folder of a module (or whatever more precise criterion to describe the situation)

[14:59] <Nemokosch> > %?RESOURCES is a compile-time variable available to the code of a Distribution.

[15:03] <[Coke]> Nemokosch: https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3205 - can you add any notes here?

[15:06] <Nemokosch> > %?RESOURCES has to be invoked from a module to work. (NYI for scripts)

[15:06] <Nemokosch> This might mean the same thing

[15:08] <Nemokosch> It seems to me that "module", "lib/ folder" and "a Distribution" try to catch the same phenomenon
