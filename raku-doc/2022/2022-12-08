[14:36] <tbrowder> .ask [Coke]: what version of Aspell are you running? all my hosts use 0.60.7 and the latest is 0.68.8! it was released in 2019--i'm surprised the latest debian doesn't have it?

[14:36] <tbrowder> ! gonna see if upgrade fixes the problem...

[15:29] <[Coke]> @(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 (but really Aspell 0.60.8)

[15:30] <[Coke]> I'll do a package update on that box.

[15:33] <[Coke]> (macports a little old here)

[15:35] <[Coke]> looks like that's the latest macports has

[16:06] <NemokoschKiwi> mmm, let me retry... when can we hold a supplementary meeting? I know, infrasructure and all... would be good to get to know about that as well but regardless, perhaps we can do some planning about the content, or nice-to-have things about the not-yet-deployed site.

[18:57] <Nemokosch> that time can be fine by me

[20:23] <[Coke]> ok, sold.

[20:23] <[Coke]> Nemokosch: if you can add a note to raku/doc/wiki's main page, I'd appreciate it

[20:23] <[Coke]> let's also schedule one for 4 weeks later in january too.

[22:31] <[Coke]> we should probably just say 2nd saturday each month.
