[09:54] <Nemokosch> [Coke]: thank you for the Discussions page - if I saw it earlier, I could have already mentioned in the Raku Study meeting, perhaps Rob would have been interested

[09:55] <Nemokosch> For the other one - I'm not at the right computer now, it would be good to see actual visual examples

[09:55] <Nemokosch> Another thought I had is that it would be good to somehow automatically check all links.

[09:56] <Nemokosch> I still come across broken links quite regularly

[09:58] <Nemokosch> and I'd have another question regarding Documentable and Collection but 1. I'm still not completely up-to-date and 2. I don't want to hijack my own topic; that's actually something that might have a better place on the discussion tab :P

[11:43] <Nemokosch> https://youtu.be/Rmuyb9kSQhY?t=1435 apparently Richard already tests the links... again, communication. I wish this community weren't this fragmented
