[12:49] <[Coke]> I am also fine with jitsi.

[12:51] <lizmat> then it's just a matter of coming up with a Jitsi URL and a time  :-)

[12:52] *** Kaipei joined
[12:52] <[Coke]> just installed the client on my cell, created a room, seems fine?

[12:54] <[Coke]> I would rather not announce the full URL on the weekly, but please feel free to mention Jitsi; we can share the URL here in advance the day before.

[13:01] <lizmat> sure...

[13:08] <[Coke]> Probably being over protective.

[13:14] * [Coke] has to re-learn docker...

[13:15] <lizmat> re being protective: yeah, maybe: at this point I'd say the more the merrier

[13:16] <lizmat> after the lockdowns, I think people wanting to join in on an online meeting freely, should be cherished  :-)

[13:16] <[Coke]> let's use raku-docs-2022-05 as the room name, not sure how to get the URL from that.

[13:17] <[Coke]> and if you want to share it, I'm fine with that.

[13:33] *** Guest35 joined
[14:33] <[Coke]> https://meet.jit.si/raku-docs-2022-05 will be the URL

[14:34] <[Coke]> I just connected from my phone.

[14:35] <[Coke]> (but offline now)

[14:35] <[Coke]> You should be able to test the connection before day of. Coordinate with someone here if you want to make sure everything works

[14:39] <[Coke]> expecting maybe 30m for the first call, not sure

[15:20] * Altai-man cannot really participate, but would be glad to work given there are tasks assigned

[15:52] <[Coke]> heh. I kind of want you on the call since you have the site in progress.

[15:52] <[Coke]> I'll try to make sure I have any questions out to you pre-call

[15:58] <Altai-man> I wouldn't say it's "in progress". Or, well, but is, but what I'm waiting for is a list of "fix this, this, this, deploy, work out this and that and we're good" sorta management, plus hopefully we'll be able to work out a roadmap for bigger issues we have (opinion on what those are, in short: absence of versioning in the docs, poor state of rakudo changes versioning).

[15:58] <Altai-man> and sure, questions are welcome

[20:36] <uzl[m]> What time is the meeting? Do all attendees need to present or can some of them simply attend it? ðŸ˜…

[20:39] <uzl[m]> ^ Never mind my question about the meetup time... 05/21/2022 at 19:00 EST for reference
