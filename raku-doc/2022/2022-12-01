[22:38] <NemokoschKiwi> Now that I actually realized what needs to be done about that issue

[22:41] <NemokoschKiwi> I'd say the whole IRC description of https://docs.raku.org/language/community could be basically turned into a link to https://raku.org/community/irc

[22:43] <NemokoschKiwi> after a very generic, couple sentences "overview", like "IRC channels have been an essential platform of interactive communication within the community for more than a decade" or something like this along the lines

[22:44] <NemokoschKiwi> Something that explains why you want to click on that link, without having specific details that may turn outdated soon - like the current content itself.

[22:44] <NemokoschKiwi> What are your thoughts about this?

[22:48] <[Coke]> sounds good
