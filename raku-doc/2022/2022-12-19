[01:24] <[Coke]> I can't duplicate the problem.

[01:25] <[Coke]> no, reproduce an error in xt/aspell.t on a debian box.

[01:28] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4162

[01:47] <tbrowder> ok, i'll check it out, thnz

[16:43] <NemokoschKiwi> see, that's why I liked the categories in the search

[16:46] <sena_kun> NemokoschKiwi, well, some duplicates are due to a bug.

[16:46] <sena_kun> Others doesn't look so bad to me except for the bug.

[16:53] <NemokoschKiwi> I think it's fairly uncommon that you start typing "list" without having at least a superficial sense of what you are looking for, out of the gazillion entries

[16:53] <sena_kun> true

[16:54] <sena_kun> extended search can be used for that though

[16:54] <NemokoschKiwi> like I know that I want to find methods named list, or List. Not the class List

[16:54] <sena_kun> well, that's easy

[16:54] <sena_kun> just search for `&list` or `.list`.

[16:54] <sena_kun> or if you want a class, `::List` will do

[16:54] <sena_kun> It's a pity we don't have those rules written somewhere in an easy to spot place though

[16:55] <NemokoschKiwi> easy it may be but how should anyone know this? ðŸ˜…

[16:56] <NemokoschKiwi> even if we don't consider that this didn't work on the old site... where is any hint that this would work?

[16:56] <NemokoschKiwi> the entry names themselves clearly don't imply it

[16:57] <sena_kun> yes, that's the problem

[16:57] <sena_kun> I mean, reach-ability of this feature is nothing but dust compared to reach-ability of the website itself right now. :)

[16:58] <NemokoschKiwi> Sure thing but one needs something to stay motivated, and it seems we literally cannot do anything about that

[16:59] <sena_kun> you're right

[17:00] <NemokoschKiwi> anyway, I can't be dissatisfied because you just gave me a straightforward solution to a nuisance

[17:00] <NemokoschKiwi> it's another thing to eventually raise awareness of it in general

[18:06] <tbrowder>  .tell [Coke] unbelievable: i put yr steps in a bash script on the VM, ran it, and got the same error i always get! i took away sudo for you, but i can give it back if need be. my first thought is to see if your 'env' is any different from mine. my second thought is for you to 'su - tbrowde' and run as me. i must be affected by cosmic rays in a

[18:07] <tbrowder> .tell [Coke] ^^^^
