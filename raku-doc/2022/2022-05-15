[14:05] <[Coke]> Next Saturday, noon Eastern work for everyone?

[14:05] <[Coke]> (for the call?)

[14:41] <[Coke]> hope so. :)

[14:42] <[Coke]> Altai-man suggested Skype, which I am fine with. We'll use irc as chat channel if needed.

[16:38] <lizmat> FWIW, the RSC uses a free jitsi, which works fine for ~ 10 people

[18:05] <coleman> Works for me

[18:06] <coleman> My IRC bouncer seems to be working, so i think I can have a more accurate running list of what's going on :)

[18:07] <coleman> I am still a Raku beginner, I'd say; but I fancy myself a decent writer and a ruthless editor.

[18:07] <coleman> So I'd be willing to be assigned general cleanup or guide authoring. I think we could use guides on zef + mi6 or similar.

[18:10] <lizmat> ++coleman

[18:10] <coleman> ACK

[18:10] <coleman> :)

[18:11] <coleman> 202 ACCEPTED
