[13:24] <[Coke]> Altai-man: let's catch up on saturday?

[13:24] <Altai-man> [Coke], sure. if you can create a google meet or something, it'd be nice

[13:24] <Altai-man> but to be precise

[13:25] <Altai-man> I'm not sure if we have an agenda or anything to discuss

[13:25] <Altai-man> the urgent problems were fixed I believe

[13:25] <Altai-man> so it's mostly about contactring rba regarding changing the domain recordes

[13:25] <Altai-man> *records

[13:26] <Altai-man> *contacting

[13:26] <Altai-man> ugh, fingers...

[13:30] <[Coke]> (urgent problems) so, where do things stand now?

[13:30] <[Coke]> I think I missed any urgent problems if they happened recently.

[15:46] <patrickb> Is the server sorted out? (I.e. only the domain name is missing?)

[16:33] <Altai-man> patrickb, I'll ask if there is one, but otherwise I have a DO droplet already used for that so...
