[13:38] <tbrowder> [Coke]: just talked with jj, he has an interesting take on the problem. he thinks aspell is the problem and should be replaced or fixed. he will spend some time on it. (and he said he never uses the xtest, he waits for you to tell him about any problems, and he obviously appreciates that 'cause he said "God bless him."
