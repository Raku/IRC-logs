[15:37] <coleman> I haven't fully automated the chroot.club url

[15:37] <coleman> I would like to, since people have found it useful

[15:41] <coleman> the CI is here https://buildkite.com/de-limited/docs-dot-raku-dot-org/builds/44#0181ada3-0d86-458b-83db-e9e1e23ee786

[16:18] <coleman> Altai-man! :)

[16:18] <coleman> I hope your holiday was wonderful; I'm at work now so I gotta go, but cheers :)

[16:31] <Altai-man> o/

[16:31] <Altai-man> the CI looks curious

[16:33] <coleman> Go easy on me. I have no idea what I'm doing! But I can self host lots of stuff

[16:34] <coleman> I am roughly following the advice from the replies to my reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/v19zyw/how_do_you_deploy_your_code_no_docker/

[16:42] <[Coke]> oh, that was you? I was wondering why "no docker" was a requirement.

[16:42] <[Coke]> but didn't have the spoons to get into an argument with a stranger on the internet. :)

[16:45] <coleman> I am a man of great passion, but within me is a deep well of empathy and forgiveness

[17:02] <Altai-man> I think I'd still be a bit more calm with a docker-compose based setup, even though I myself host some services avoiding it.
