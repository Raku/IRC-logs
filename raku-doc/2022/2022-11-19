[17:12] <NemokoschKiwi> well, if I'm not wrong, it's 19 November, past noon eastern time...

[17:20] <lizmat> yeah, looks like  :-(

[17:21] <NemokoschKiwi> so it's not just me, a bit of a relief ðŸ˜…

[19:08] <lizmat> I just got this from [Coke] by email:

[19:08] <lizmat> Can you let folks know on raku-doc - apologies, had to take a kid to the emergency room.

[19:08] <lizmat> Nothing too serious but it meant I couldnâ€™t be online for the call today.

[19:08] <lizmat> No worries if not Iâ€™ll check in with irc when I get back

[19:08] <lizmat> NemokoschKiwi ^^

[19:13] <sena_kun> oh, that's unfortunate

[19:13] <sena_kun> and I also missed the call then, dammit

[19:13] <sena_kun> OTOH I don't have any updated

[19:21] <NemokoschKiwi> I mean... was there a call at all?

[19:21] <NemokoschKiwi> I wouldn't know about it

[21:14] <NemokoschKiwi> sena_kun: I can see a mustache template file in the doc website repo; is it used anywhere?

[21:15] <NemokoschKiwi> hm, perhaps it belongs to the old doc site

[21:20] <sena_kun> NemokoschKiwi, docs.raku.oro repo? no, it isn't.

[21:45] <NemokoschKiwi> huh, I wanted to do something either with raku.org or the doc site but I feel too exhausted mentally. I feel doing a bit of leftover testing stuff for work might be actually a relief at this point
