[12:58] <Nemokosch> I'm going to take my rant here ironically, exactly because of the implications: the ultimate issue with getting ANYTHING Raku-related done is that no one on planet Earth feels responsible for making decisions or even just taking a stance on an issue.

[13:00] <Nemokosch> No matter all the trickery I'm doing within Raku spaces, be it IRC, Discord, GH discussions, issues under several repositories, linking them together, responding, trying to get to fixes when possible

[13:01] <Nemokosch> Even to get a banal PR merged is a matter of sheer luck

[13:06] <Nemokosch> I don't know what it was like when all issues were essentially dumped onto jnthn but it absolutely couldn't be worse than the current situation

[13:09] <Nemokosch> Also, let's release this "we are volunteers and therefore everyone contributes as much as they can/want to" excuse for good

[13:10] <Nemokosch> Not all volunteer-driven projects are equally badly managed and Raku itself has had ups and downs from management point of view

[13:18] <sena_kun> Nemokosch, do you mind a private conversation?

[13:19] <Nemokosch> no

[14:04] * lizmat assume a private conversation is taking place

[14:05] <lizmat> Nemokosch: maybe you should apply for a commit bit to Rakudo ?

[14:34] <Nemokosch> lizmat: Maybe I should apply for something, you are right. I'm trying to help with Rakudo as well, as much as I can comprehend after more or less 2 months of looking closer - but I honestly don't think that requires the most help at the moment

[14:35] <lizmat> it would solve the issue of PR's not getting merged

[14:39] <Nemokosch> That was the most extreme example, the problems go way deeper than that

[14:43] <Nemokosch> Somebody pointed it out more than 2 years ago that "problem solving" was not working. Around that time, there were people to argue with that.

[14:46] <Nemokosch> Today, nobody would argue with that. Not because there couldn't be a discussion about it but because it has a much bigger proof: nobody cares about solving any sort of problems.

[14:47] <lizmat> not arguing with that

[14:49] <Nemokosch> I can try to sort out Rakudo content but with my qualifications, that seems more like a sure way to burnout than achieving anything visible. Also, from what I see with some of the issues I remember: a Rakudo PR can be a place where a design decision gets stuck. And then we are back to "problem solving"

[14:55] <Nemokosch> "forgiveness > permission" is wise but how far can one go? Say, somebody can decide that lazy lists don't ACCEPT any single item. What about deprecation and undeprecation of things? That's also a prevalent topic. Or infrastructure: I'm still pondering who *knows* the current state at all, let alone the possible answers themselves

[14:57] <Nemokosch> I don't know if the RSC was created with this sort of topics in mind or how feasibly operable it is wrt these topics

[14:59] <Nemokosch> I was also thinking that we might get closer to give squashathons a (re)try; I have a superficial plan that I can still refine better. Secretly I'm hoping that it could be an "excuse" for having public(-ish) meetings with multiple people regularly.

[15:00] <Nemokosch> And you know, when I have these plans... that's when it really hits me that so many people aren't even willing to dedicate 5 minutes of consistent attention to issues that could really be resolved forever

[15:01] <Nemokosch> "vote" about a language decision, pass ownership of a repo, minor things like this
