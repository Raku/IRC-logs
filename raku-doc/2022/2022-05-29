[16:16] <[Coke]> I have a friend ex-coworker who does technical writing, pinged them to see if they have any interest in working on an OSS project. :)

[17:43] <coleman> cool; I'm still working on my build env. I'll get there, just boiling the ocean at the moment.

[17:43] <coleman> e.g. building the toolchain from scratch

[17:44] <coleman> If you sort the issues by date, there are many old ones. 

[17:45] <coleman> Perhaps some are defunct and should be closed? I don't know what our policy should be on this. I kind of like to close stuff.

[19:14] <coleman> ping (again)

[21:54] <[Coke]> I do not like closing tickets merely because they are old. I agree old tickets should be reviewed to verify they are not defunct.

[21:55] <coleman> I agree, that's prudent.

[22:00] <coleman> I'm getting close on my ground-up CI environment for Altai-man's docs site

[22:01] <coleman> I pay for a buildkite account and I run build agents in LXD, so I've been sketching out a packer build for an LXD container that builds rakudo, zef, documentable

[22:02] <coleman> I will try to make the CI results public. I've never done that with Buildkite, but since I'm in charge of that stuff at work, it's something I need to learn how to do for our open source projects :)

[22:07] <[Coke]> (y)
