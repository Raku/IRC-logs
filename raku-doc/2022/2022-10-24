[14:04] <[Coke]> Thanks again to sena_kun for pushing things forward. Sorry I missed you on IRC - leaving again on a business trip shortly, will have email but IRC will be challenging, please feel free to ping me on email with anything.

[14:05] <sena_kun> [Coke], no worries. Current blocker is actually hosting the website, the container is there, but we need some assist from the infra team to help out with domain names / setup.

[14:30] * lizmat looks forward to making it the main article in the RWN

[14:36] <sena_kun> me too, kid.jpg

[14:43] <patrickb> I seem to remember there being a infra team password list that gives access to various infra related systems. I wonder who has access to that list. Would be good to know for situations like these.

[15:01] <sena_kun> well, I have access to portainer

[15:01] <sena_kun> I don't have knowledge (possibly access) to set up domains, for example

[15:01] <sena_kun> I'm in contact with both maettu and rba, it just takes time I guess
