[12:09] <sena_kun> I know what I have to do, I just don't know if I'm strong enough to do it. :)

[12:09] <sena_kun> just deployed a new build, so some fixes should now be visible (be sure to reload cached JS too)

[12:10] <sena_kun> patrickb, hi! The bug with the google search is now fixed (or rather it works for me)

[12:13] <sena_kun> also, http://164.90.207.89:10010/404 is now... 500 error due to the second blocker, but it's better than what we had.

[12:13] <sena_kun> so some progress done
