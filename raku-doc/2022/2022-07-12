[07:17] <Nemokosch> Do I see it right that currently there aren't many hints about what containers certain methods return? Like Map.values returns the container of the values, allowing for mutability - but how should someone know this, without trying?

[07:28] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[08:12] <lizmat> Nemokosch 

[08:12] <lizmat> Nemokosch: well, people tried expecting it, and it didn't work, so it was changed to allow for it

[08:14] <Nemokosch> I mean it does seem like a feature. The question is rather, how is this type of information noted? Regardless of the example

[08:14] <lizmat> that's a good question
