[14:22] <[Coke]> Jul 9th for meeting, I think. not quite monthly but let's get it on the calendar.

[14:30] <[Coke]> let me know if that's bad (want to avoid july 4th weekend here in the states)

[15:41] <sena_kun> alright for me

[15:41] <sena_kun> I thought the call's gonna be this weekend, no?

[15:46] <[Coke]> Never advertised it, so no

[15:46] <[Coke]> we can catch up here if needed, of course.

[15:46] <sena_kun> got it, guess I mixed something up

[15:46] <[Coke]> I think we need to get devops on board as next step for the new site.

[15:47] <[Coke]> no, it was the original idea, I just never followed through

[15:47] <sena_kun> no, no "need" to do. I'm making some progress with the website, the update now should work (not deployed yet, I also replied to your concern in the ticket), plus fixing a couple of the major search issues.

[15:47] <[Coke]> any blockers/interesting bugs reported on the new site?

[15:47] <[Coke]> yah, if there's a key required, no worries. I was concerned people would just be able to hit .../update and kick it off

[15:48] <sena_kun> 1)Cro is one of the blockers; 2)https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/issues/59 3)search issues I'm up to

[15:48] <sena_kun> also would be cool to have <meta> descriptions and robots.txt taken by someone before the real release.

[15:48] <sena_kun> those are real "blockers" i can think of.

[15:49] <sena_kun> s/are/are the/

[15:50] <[Coke]> is there a ticket on the cro issue?

[15:51] <sena_kun> you mean reports in the cro repo or?

[15:52] <sena_kun> yes, https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/131 and https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/73

[16:53] <[Coke]> new docs site could use some eyes on https://github.com/croservices/cro-webapp/issues/73 and https://github.com/croservices/cro-http/issues/131

[16:53] <[Coke]> ww

[16:54] <coleman> works for me
