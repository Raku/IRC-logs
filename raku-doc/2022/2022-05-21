[15:16] <[Coke]> Meeting in about 45 minutes.

[15:16] <[Coke]> Sadly, I think I may have picked the worst time for the two people I wanted the most feedback out of. :)

[15:40] <sena_kun> [Coke], ping?

[15:45] <sena_kun> I guess it's not the best timing to join the meeting now. : )

[15:46] <coleman> Good day!

[15:47] <coleman> Assuming this is still the link https://meet.jit.si/raku-docs-2022-05

[15:48] <sena_kun> the meeting is in 10 minutes, right?

[15:48] <[Coke]> yes

[15:49] <sena_kun> thanks, so I'll join I guess

[15:51] <[Coke]> WOO

[15:51] <[Coke]> I hope I haven't oversold the utility of this meeting. :)

[15:52] <coleman> you gotta start somewhere

[15:59] <[Coke]> I wonder at what point I will stop reading 'coleman' as 'colomon'

[16:51] <coleman> Here are the meeting notes https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Minutes:-2022-05-21

[16:52] <coleman> Please edit if I misinterpreted anything, new vs. old, etc.

[16:57] <[Coke]> here are the build notes I got from the devops call:

[16:57] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/5cf8b0467ca36a28686279def693e447

[16:58] <[Coke]> the markdown is the curated notes, I did include basically the chat log.

[16:58] <[Coke]> Thanks to everyone who was able to join!

[17:01] <coleman> Does the devops team have their own IRC channel?

[17:06] <[Coke]> don't think so.

[17:08] <[Coke]> updated md gist which wasn't actually written in markdown.

[17:12] <[Coke]> (but is now)

[17:34] <patrickb> Hi!

[17:35] * patrickb reads the backlog

[17:35] <patrickb> I think I'm too late for the meeting, right?

[18:17] <sena_kun> patrickb, yup

[18:38] <[Coke]> was noon Eastern (2:40 ago)

[18:39] <[Coke]> will be a regular thing going forward (probably limited to 30m tops), so you're welcome to join next time

[18:39] <[Coke]> coleman: let's figure out the best time for folks before locking anything in. Earlier on a saturday might work better?

[18:56] <coleman> I can go earlier

[18:56] <coleman> i'd be willing to do 9 or 10 

[18:57] <coleman> and rotating it for other timezones might be fine, too

[19:07] <coleman> This channel ought to have a topic/description. Coke do you have power?

[19:07] <coleman> Perhaps just a link to the wiki

[19:56] <coleman> My first (but not last) attempt to build the old-docs branch is in a txt file on my private server

[19:56] <coleman> https://git.de.limited/coleman/raku-site-builds/src/branch/main/20220521_install.txt#L318-L319

[19:57] <coleman> I am sketching out a packer build that builds an LXD container with the requirements Coke sent

[19:57] <coleman> LXD is cool because they're containers, but you can easily run Docker/Podman containers inside :)

[19:57] <coleman> anyways that's just for my personal notes

[19:58] <coleman> it's a shell session. Had to skip tests but that might be because I hadn't installed graphviz initially
