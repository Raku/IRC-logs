[16:56] <coleman> working on deploying the nextgen docs site to a domain i own

[16:56] <coleman> Got some good feedback on reddit

[17:01] <coleman> doing it on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/keyvalue

[17:24] *** sjn joined
[17:24] <sjn> \o

[18:00] <coleman> [Coke]: check it out http://docs.raku.chroot.club:20000/type-composite

[18:04] <drakonis> let me teach you about the wonders of reverse proxy!

[18:13] <coleman> lol

[18:14] <coleman> it's a little slow w/o one, but it loaded for you, right?

[18:18] <drakonis> it did, yeah.

[18:18] <coleman> let's just make Cro and MoarVM faster! :)

[18:18] <drakonis> i prefer reverse proxying to prevent the leaking of port info

[18:18] <coleman> But yea I'll put a proxy in front

[18:18] <drakonis> it is actually loading fast

[18:19] <coleman> yeah after the cache warms up and your browser is probably caching too

[18:19] <coleman> it looks cool

[18:20] <coleman> I'll figure out the proxy thing soon and report back w/ a nice HTTPS site

[18:20] <drakonis> so it does

[18:20] <drakonis> i'd recommend caddy solely for the ease of doing so

[18:20] <coleman> caddy is my proxy, normally 

[18:21] <coleman> i haven't gotten lets encrypt certs on this domain before, though. it's a new purchase.

[18:21] <coleman> are you involved w/ docs team?

[18:21] <coleman> i'm still new, sorry. Dunno if you were at the meeting.

[18:27] <drakonis> i'm not involved but i've joined here to help out where i can

[18:28] <drakonis> caddy 1 or 2 btw?

[18:28] <drakonis> its basically just reverse_proxy localhost:port and you're done

[18:28] <drakonis> and caddy takes care of the rest

[18:28] <drakonis> wonderful.

[18:29] <coleman> caddy 2

[18:29] <coleman> but i just a caddyfile, not the api

[18:30] <drakonis> well, you can do that with a caddyfile

[18:30] <drakonis> i've been using it myself and it works well

[18:39] <uzl[m]> I am getting "502 Bad Gateway" when I go to http://164.90.207.89:10010/ (https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/1246#issuecomment-1101393152)

[18:40] <uzl[m]> Is it hosted somewhere else?

[18:40] <coleman> I'd wager the site just wasn't kept online

[18:40] <uzl[m]> Nvm, I just scrolled up and there's also http://docs.raku.chroot.club:20000/ now

[18:41] <coleman> That's temporary, but I will try to have one online 24/7

[18:41] <coleman> But consider it unofficial! I'm new to Raku and I'm just trying to learn how to deploy stuff

[18:41] <uzl[m]> Ah great!!!

[18:41] <coleman> I'm a programmer by trade, though. So I'm pretty handy with linux

[18:42] <coleman> and general ops stuff

[18:42] <uzl[m]> Don't worry about it ;-) Nice to have you onboard!!!

[18:42] <coleman> thanks :)

[18:42] <uzl[m]> For some reason, I thought you were [Coke] haha

[18:45] <coleman> haha well it's "coleman" on irc and irl so nice to meet you

[18:49] <uzl[m]> Nice to meet you! I am fairly new to Raku as well, on and off but more off than on haha

[18:52] <coleman> it's so fascinating

[18:57] <drakonis> it is nice, eyyy

[18:57] <drakonis> i want to make a deployment tool that uses raku

[19:07] <drakonis> i have big plans

[19:07] <coleman> Do you have elements of existing tools you like? I'm pretty familiar with Chef, Salt, Terraform, and Puppet

[19:07] <coleman> I like some things from all of them, but none of them are *exactly* what I want :)

[19:08] <coleman> I hate Yaml, for instance :D

[19:08] <drakonis> i have

[19:08] <drakonis> i'm quite interested in the likes of guix and nix

[19:09] <drakonis> i would like to allow all configuration to be done using the host language and let people map markup formats to it

[19:09] <coleman> ah that is quite a different approach from the tools i mentioned

[19:09] <drakonis> as opposed to making the markup format the default means of interaction

[19:09] <drakonis> i want to also mix up some of the existing tools to provide flexibility

[19:09] <drakonis> some of the elements, that is.

[19:10] <drakonis> i like guix and nix but the execution falls short in some places

[19:10] <coleman> Have you used the CUE config language yet?

[19:11] <coleman> it's less powerful than Nix or Dhall (no functions), but is easier to read, imo

[19:11] <drakonis> i have not, no.

[19:12] <coleman> I don't believe that a whole system can be orchestrated from pure declarative formats, rather having well-defined layers of declarative->imperative->declarative... is my philosophy

[19:12] <coleman> it's a very interesting problem space

[19:12] <coleman> (configuring machines, that is)

[19:12] <drakonis> that is what i want to do

[19:13] <coleman> If you like Nix, have a look at CUE. Logic-programming approach as opposed to functional, but they are clearly doing similar things

[19:13] <coleman> and, for what it's worth, it's way easier to use imo

[19:14] <coleman> it's just for data

[19:14] <coleman> I wrote a short tutorial https://gist.github.com/dontlaugh/ca64293f3e5138b2d03125d7300f5c9c

[19:14] <drakonis> that would be interesting

[19:15] <drakonis> that's a thing that would be quite fine

[19:15] <coleman> the only CUE implementation is in Go, right now. I would LOVE to have a Raku one. But it's beyond my skills right now.

[19:16] <coleman> So it's fine to "shell out" to the cue binary in the meantime.

[19:17] <coleman> Okay I need to work on this raku docs CI a bit more

[19:17] <drakonis> i know that nickel is going for a cue-style language

[19:17] <drakonis> alright

[19:17] <drakonis> i really want me some bloody macros to do things the way i'm envisioning

[19:17] <drakonis> abusing code pipelines for fun and profit

[20:28] <coleman> Okay I have enabled TLS and moved the site to port 443 https://docs.raku.chroot.club/

[20:33] <coleman> oops I forgot that the actual server is running in a terminal window lol. Still not done.

[20:44] <coleman> An issue I didn't realize until just now https://github.com/Altai-man/docs.raku.org/issues/61

[20:44] <coleman> where is the actual content? and how should we start porting things over?

[20:45] <coleman> or is all that structure still TBD?

[22:00] <drakonis> coleman: use tmux

[22:00] <drakonis> if you dont have a service unit yet

[22:29] <coleman> I set up a service unit
