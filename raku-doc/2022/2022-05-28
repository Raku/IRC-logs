[22:33] <coleman> building new site in a Docker container now...

[22:45] <coleman> added my attempt at building the old site to this gist from last week https://gist.github.com/coke/5cf8b0467ca36a28686279def693e447?permalink_comment_id=4182255#gistcomment-4182255

[22:56] <[Coke]> coleman: missing step, need to install mojolicious in your perl5

[22:57] <coleman> gotcha

[22:57] <[Coke]> https://www.mojolicious.org/ //Installation

[22:58] <[Coke]> did some very minor ticket maint last few days. Need to reach out to devops and ask if the instructions we have are OK for the new site.

[22:59] <coleman> I thought the new site was pre-release and only Altai-man was working on it?

[23:04] <[Coke]> The goal is to make it a release, so need devops signoff.

[23:04] <[Coke]> but yes, today, it's not live anywhere

[23:04] <[Coke]> we could have devops spin it up somewhere "official" as part of the testing.

[23:04] <[Coke]> -> afk

[23:05] <coleman> understood
