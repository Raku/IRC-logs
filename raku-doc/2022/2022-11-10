[01:31] <Nemokosch> oh another thing that can affect the documentation as well. Github has "discussions" now, seems like some built-in forum to me

[01:33] <Nemokosch> it's better for many of these discussions than either IRC, or a github issue, and more convenient than an oldschool mailing list

[01:34] <Nemokosch> it could be allowed for as many Raku repos as possible, and especially for the doc repo

[04:56] <CIAvash> May I ask what is the autocomplete issue? Is there an open issue  for it? Is it related to the new website for docs?

[11:27] <Nemokosch> But I think almost all Raku sites use the same jQuery plugin so you may witness similar behavior for any categorized autocomplete
