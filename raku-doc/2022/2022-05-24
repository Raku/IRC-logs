[00:25] <coleman> The kind of artifact we should yield kind of depends on what ops wants

[01:58] <[Coke]> ok, the 2-step docker process - the build went ok, I think; the run step doesn't seem to be doing anything.

[01:58] <[Coke]> no output on the run command, nothing responding on port 10K

[01:58] <[Coke]> also: when did telnet stop being a thing, I missed the memo. :|

[01:59] <[Coke]> curl http://localhost:10000/ -> empty reply

[02:23] <[Coke]> tried opening a shell in the running 'next-docs' but it is (of course) very barebones. (couldn't find 'ps')

[02:24] <[Coke]> ... ok, restarted it at least once, tried going in with a shell, tried ... opening in the browser again and I am looking at the docs locally in the browser. :)

[02:50] <[Coke]> Can we get https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4072 in the new site? would be fine if it was a separate, unlinked URL and not on each page.
