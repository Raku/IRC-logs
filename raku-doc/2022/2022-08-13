[14:59] <[Coke]> sena_kun: Can you ping me your preferred email address?

[14:59] <[Coke]> (want to start the convo with infra - belatedly, apologies)

[15:15] <coleman> Looking for the changelog so I can link it here

[15:18] <coleman> Housekeeping; I recommend removing GitHub "Releases" from the view. It's a checkbox you can uncheck https://github.com/Raku/doc/releases

[15:18] <coleman> I've never found a use for them in docs repos; we can re-introduce them if we actually use them

[15:19] <coleman> Link to Rakudo release: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/tag/2022.07

[15:19] <coleman> I will create a ticket in docs

[15:40] <coleman> Here is the ticket https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4104

[15:42] <coleman> That was pretty tedious to do manually; A better way will be to parse this file https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/ChangeLog

[15:44] <sena_kun> [Coke], alexander.kiryuhin@gmail.com

[15:45] <sena_kun> oh, should've been sent it privately I think, but this mail is on github in public anyway

[15:46] <coleman> I really want a mailing list

[15:47] <coleman> but IRC is fine for now

[15:50] <lizmat> coleman : if you're worried about having a permanent record, check out irclogs.raku.org  :-)

[15:51] <coleman> I just like longform writing for discussion as an option. Chat rooms are still essential, of course

[15:53] <lizmat> understood

[16:07] <coleman> Reminder: I have started a wiki page for details about the Production environment https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Production-Environment

[16:08] <coleman> If you know anything at all about what powers things right now, and how we want to change things in the near term, kindly drop links or notes in there
