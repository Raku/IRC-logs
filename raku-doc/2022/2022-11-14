[12:23] <sjn> Hey, there's something weird going on this page: https://examples.raku.org/categories/cookbook.html

[12:24] <sjn> it says 'Perl 6 Examples' and the links point to empty pages

[12:24] <sjn> (this page was found on https://examples.raku.org/index.html, which is linked from the front page)

[12:26] <sena_kun> sjn, I believe the website (and repo) is not maintained/abandoned. it's more efficient to spend resources on the documentation instead, I believe.
