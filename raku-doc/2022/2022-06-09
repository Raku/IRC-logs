[15:23] <[Coke]> Should we move the breaking merge commit from master to a branch and use that branch until we cutover?

[15:24] <[Coke]> Or push forward with getting masters all working together with Documentable & raku/doc and the new site?

[15:24] <[Coke]> I think at this point, leaning to the latter.

[17:44] <coleman> I defer to you on the cutover plan, since you're more familiar with the problem space

[17:45] <coleman> I'm not quite sure waht the latter means; have you put your notes in an issue or maybe a wiki doc for planning the cutover/migration?

[17:46] <coleman> I'll put some time in this weekend

[17:46] <coleman> thanks for getting back to me btw
