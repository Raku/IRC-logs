[21:33] <Nemokosch> Hello

[21:34] <Nemokosch> Browsing raku.org, I found this link of the "perl6-workshops" mailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/perl6-workshops?hl=en

[21:35] <Nemokosch> It seems it cannot be accessed (not without some explicitly granted permission at least). Can I remove it?

[22:54] <[Coke]> Seems reasonable to hide the obscure lists.

[22:55] <[Coke]> thanks
