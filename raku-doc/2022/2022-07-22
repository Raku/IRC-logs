[20:34] <patrickb> I've been using the new docs site exclusively for some time now. From my experience there are only minor glitches. IMHO nothing that would prevent a go-live. Is there some blocker bug that I'm unaware of?

[20:34] <patrickb> sena_kun: Did you notice https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/c15e580480d44616eace320ccda95ed3?permalink_comment_id=4231734#gistcomment-4231734 ?

[21:37] <sena_kun> patrickb, 1)yes, noticed that, THANK YOU VERY MUCH for replying; 2)the two Cro bugs were resolved, so we're pretty nice for now, but; 3)we still need to resolve what I described, it's just that I have to muster some courage to do breaking changes for that.

[21:38] <sena_kun> hopefully I'll resolve it this weekend, but no promises alas.
