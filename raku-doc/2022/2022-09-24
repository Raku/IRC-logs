[07:39] <patrickb> Nemokosch: We currently have no one feeling responsible for the websites. So no, there is no strategic plan for the sites. Work on improving them is appreciated. I guess the only requirement before making a (lager) change is giving enough time for potential feedback. So just go ahead, make a PR, ping lizmat so the PR ends up in the weekly, then merge it after two weeks time or earlier if you got respective positive feedback.
