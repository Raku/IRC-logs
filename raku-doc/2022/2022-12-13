[02:17] <[Coke]> In my defense, there is a TON of text there.

[17:42] <tbrowder> is there a public container available so i can use “make docker-xtest?”

[17:44] <tbrowder> i tried the default and got a msg about trust issues

[17:45] <tbrowder> do i need to get on jmerelo’s access list somehow

[18:39] <[Coke]> as far as I know, only jj was using the docker containers. I don't touch them.

[18:40] <[Coke]> if  Ican get access to a machine that is failing the aspell test, I can probably find a root cause

[19:01] <tbrowder> using a common and available docker might be a way around my mysterious problem. tony-o uses docker a lot. i was using one of his for git testing. maybe he could set one up to work and stay unchanged until need be.

[19:02] <tbrowder> just for the docs

[20:22] <tbrowder> [Coke]: would you be willing to access one of mine remotely if i spin one up that exhibits the problem? if so, i may have time to do that tomorrow 

[21:00] <[Coke]> sure

[21:01] <[Coke]> don't need admin access, will just pimg you if I find something missing.
