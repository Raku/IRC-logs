[08:05] * patrickb is interested in documentation and also interested in helping out. But perma-low on time and too many projects and still a grant in progress.

[08:07] <patrickb> A (huge) PR I'd love to get merged at one point: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4047

[13:15] <[Coke]> patrickb: Roger, will look at that one. It's content only, yes?

[13:17] <[Coke]> lizmat: thanks for adding raku-doc to the log list. :)

[13:18] <[Coke]> (looks like it hasn't been updated in a bit?)

[13:19] <lizmat> looks up-to-date to me ?

[16:15] <patrickb> [Coke]: Yes, #4047 is content only. It's a clean up of the object tutorial.

[16:17] <[Coke]> Looking at JJ's final comment, I'm not sure there is anything blocking merging that to master.

[16:17] *** Guest35 joined
[16:20] <[Coke]> er, content wise. it's still conflicted.

[16:21] <[Coke]> s/still/again/

[16:29] <patrickb> Sadly not still, but again.

[16:29] <patrickb> But I have already rebased it onto master.

[16:30] <patrickb> There was only a single conflict that kdiff3 was able to automatically resolve.
