[12:12] <lizmat> ok, some good some maybe not so good news

[12:13] <lizmat> I just realized that all of the RakuAST rendering test were still using Pod::To::Text

[12:13] <lizmat> so all the fixes I did were basically related to $=pod generation

[12:13] <lizmat> and so RakuDoc::To::Text is basically untested as of yet

[12:14] <lizmat> and is actually not working atm because of some weird internal error

[12:15] <lizmat> the good news: RakuDoc::To::Text should render faster than Pod::To::Text, so raku documentation tests should only get faster still

[14:05] <[Coke]> cool

[21:34] <[Coke]> my current agenda: we did great 1st quarter on tickets cleanup, not so great Q2 but fin* is doing some heavy spec lifting atm.

[21:34] <[Coke]> liamat doing a bunch of work on rakuast pod

[21:35] <[Coke]> i did a small bit of enabling there, currently poking at converting tests in raku/doc to use rakuast if possible (deffinitely not in some cases)

[21:38] <[Coke]> (I am in another state right now and did not plan for raku stuff while here, entirely my bad)
