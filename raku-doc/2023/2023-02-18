[11:30] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4203

[12:26] <tbrowder> [Coke]: I'm trying to grok the issue with opener chars and Unicode's NFC and NFD forms and, apparently, Raku's own NFG form. I'm not at all sure of what or how the issue is supposed to be fixed except maybe not use an Str type in the process of generating the tables. What Unicode form should the table be in?

[13:21] <tbrowder> Now that I look closer at the issue, I note the char in question is right out of the Grammar, so is that in error? I asume not. Then any mod of that character into its observed form of another codepoint for whatever reason will appear out of order in the table. What about its matching closing char?

[13:25] <tbrowder> Also, I'm looking at the table in question in the online docs and I don't see either codepoint (U+3008 os U+2329) in the table.

[13:26] <tbrowder> s/os/or/

[13:29] <tbrowder> If the opener graphene table is to stay in the docs, I think a complementary table showing opener/closer pairs should be added.

[13:46] <tbrowder> um, just looked at $brackets def in HLL::Grammar and maybe that should be the source of the current table. i do see the x3008 and x2329 both there as openers!

[13:57] <tbrowder> So, now I suggest dumping the table in question and creating one new, but similar, table showing bracket pairs constructed from that HLL::Grammar $brackets definition. What say you?
