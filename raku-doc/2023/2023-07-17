[10:07] <NemokoschKiwi> Hi hi

[10:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: fix broken shell link

[10:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: See https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/270

[10:07] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/0bd60bbfe5

[10:07] <NemokoschKiwi> about that

[10:08] <NemokoschKiwi> it seems that https://docs.raku.org/language/independent-routines used to be generated, confer this example https://web.archive.org/web/20221130232023/https://docs.raku.org/language/independent-routines

[10:08] <NemokoschKiwi> there is a good number of links to it within the docs, and also a test that confirms those links to be valid

[10:08] <NemokoschKiwi> however, nowadays, https://docs.raku.org/type/independent-routines is generated

[10:09] <NemokoschKiwi> If you ask me, that does make a lot more conceptual sense but regardless, the current content is not prepared for that; it expects the language one to exist

[10:10] <NemokoschKiwi> so either a new redirect is needed or that content will have to be migrated back

[10:11] <lizmat> could you please make an issue for that?

[10:13] <NemokoschKiwi> sure
