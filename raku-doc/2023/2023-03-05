[04:33] <cfa> [Coke]: not sure, and agreed

[04:33] <cfa> btw, we have some true positives for C<> spacing on the regexes page

[04:33] <cfa> er, false positives

[04:34] <cfa> spacing here is intentional

[04:39] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/195 for the table issue

[04:39] <[Coke]> maybe we add a Z<ok> or something?

[04:39] <cfa> C<> spacing tests: Failed 14/416 subtests (where at least two are false positives)

[04:40] <[Coke]> and update the test to not complain. Or add a tag to the para it's in.

[04:40] <cfa> yeah

[04:41] <[Coke]> if you want to take a stab, have fun, else I'll see if I can make it work tomorrow.

[16:15] <cfa> btw leading whitespace isn't being properly tested

[16:16] <[Coke]> yah, that looks good!

[16:16] <cfa> hopefully everything passes now

[16:17] <cfa> btw, i checked rendering wasn't affected by the Z<>

[16:18] <[Coke]> cfa++

[16:20] <[Coke]> weirdly, that does impact the aspell test

[16:20] <[Coke]> it thinks the -ws from the Z is part of the text

[16:21] <cfa> oh whoops

[16:21] <cfa> feel free to change the comment text

[16:21] <cfa> i thought ws would be fine :-/

[16:22] <cfa> afk for a bit &

[16:24] <[Coke]> the leading whitespace isn't in the generated C<> objects.

[16:24] <[Coke]> guessing maybe this is a bug in pod processing?

[16:26] <[Coke]> guess the rendering doesn't show the leading whitespace.

[17:12] <cfa> oh, i see

[17:12] <cfa> Z<ignore-code-ws>C<PostgreSQL is an > is tokenised as ... wsPostgreSQL

[17:12] <cfa> a space between the Z<> and C<> there won't affect rendering so that's probably the easiest fix

[19:28] <[Coke]> fown to 445 tickets - closed a few stale, transferred a few to doc-website

[19:34] <[Coke]> i have a test for https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2954

[19:35] <[Coke]> My take: instead of C<tr>, we should use C<L<Str|/type/Str>> - we can complain about the former, and *trust* they convert to the latter

[19:35] <[Coke]> and the latter won't trigger any issues with the L<> test or the C<> test.

[19:36] <[Coke]> I put in checks for Int/Str/Num and found over 300 instances.

[19:36] <[Coke]> can expand it to other items that appear in types.

[19:40] <[Coke]> ... more like 2700 when I allow for anything in doc/Type to error. :)

[19:42] <[Coke]> and I wonder if we then also need to verify that anything that looks like L<Hash/type/Hash> is actually immediately wrapped in an C<>

[19:42] <[Coke]> feedback on this proposal appreciated.

[19:43] <[Coke]> There's the WIP

[19:47] <[Coke]> fails on 212 files, 2541 subtests fail.

[19:47] <[Coke]> The ticket also notes that just "Hash" with no C or L is also probably an style error.

[19:51] <[Coke]> ... ah, C<L< >> treats the L<> literally.

[19:52] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/language/pod.html

[19:52] <[Coke]> so I guess just L<> is the correct way.

[19:54] <[Coke]> ... L<C<>> nests, but C<L<>> does not

[19:55] <[Coke]> that means the test has to allow these if we're already in an L, thankfully we have prior art there. :)
