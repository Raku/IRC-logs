[19:09] <NemokoschKiwi> Hi, a little pod question

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> do I understand it right that

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> =begin head1

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> FooBar

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> =end head1

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> is meant to be the same as

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> =head1 FooBar

[19:10] <NemokoschKiwi> ?
