[10:58] <NemokoschKiwi> Hello, do you know where to roll back to get a working build of the site again?

[11:29] <NemokoschKiwi> Hm, or does it build again and only the branch I'm on is in the wrong state?

[12:14] <NemokoschKiwi> Yep, the branch was a tiny bit outdated.

[12:15] <NemokoschKiwi> Let me propose two related things for git workflow:

[12:16] <NemokoschKiwi> 1. PR's need to be "fast-forward" to be merged, i.e they need to be rebased before the merge. This ensures the branch contains the state that will manifest after the merger.

[12:17] <NemokoschKiwi> 2. always build the site with the state of the PR before merging, possibly checking parts that might be affected by the content of the change. I think the lesson was painful.

[13:10] <[Coke]> we don't need to pre-rebase the branches, we can do that when we merge the PR via the UI

[13:10] <[Coke]> (as far as the CI goes) - for testing things on the command line, it's nice to do, but someone testing locally can do a local rebase also.

[13:12] <[Coke]> (so, in general, yes, please keep PRs rebased against master, but I don't think it's a blocker)
