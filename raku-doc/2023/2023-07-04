[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: f92dca051c | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | doc/Language/tables.rakudoc

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Remove trailing whitespace from code blocks

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/f92dca051c

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 621b2c9f85 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | doc/Language/pod.rakudoc

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: C<M<>> is *not* the way to show verbatim M<>

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: V<M<>> is the way and currently the only way that is consistent

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: in rendering between Pod::To::Text and RakuDoc::To::Text.  Soe

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: change all the appropriate instances

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/621b2c9f85

[16:30] <lizmat> only 1 left

[16:30] <lizmat> and that's caused by improper flattening of L<> and X<> inside V<>

[17:15] <lizmat> and with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/eb169c3fc6  now all raku documentation files render the same under RakuAST as under the legacy grammar

[17:17] <lizmat> except almost 5x as fast

[17:20] <lizmat> [Coke] ^^

[17:21] <[Coke]> lizmat++

[17:22] <[Coke]> is it worth turning on that comparison test going forward until the old way goes away?

[17:26] <lizmat> I think so

[17:28] <[Coke]> Roger.

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 303aa45080 | (Will Coleda)++ | xt/rakuast-compare.rakutest

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Always run this test under 'make xtest'

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: lizmat++ got all tests passing, keep testing until the new

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: AST model is the only method (then we can remove the test file)

[17:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/303aa45080

[17:54] <[Coke]> Failed some example compilations in Language/tables.rakudoc

[17:54] <[Coke]> (running full make xtest)

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 9758544590 | (Will Coleda)++ | 2 files

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Fix error when var not set.

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: add test plan back.

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: use RAKUAST when populating cache

[17:57] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/9758544590

[18:10] <[Coke]> ... I think I may leave that one failing for a bit until I redo the examples compilation to use AST parsing instead of old school parsing to get the code blocks.

[18:35] <lizmat> $ast.grep({ $_ ~~ RakuAST::Doc::Block && .type eq 'code' | 'implicit-code' && .resolved-config<lang> eq 'raku' })

[18:35] <lizmat> [Coke]  ^^ something like that

[19:32] *** rf joined
[19:57] <[Coke]> dd 'doc/Language/faq.rakudoc'.IO.slurp.AST.grep(* ~~ RakuAST::Doc::Block); # Cannot find method 'from-paragraphs' on object of type NQPMu

[19:58] <[Coke]> ... my fault

[20:14] <[Coke]> RAKUAST makes t/03-tests-valid.rakutest very unhappy

[20:16] <[Coke]> wonder if I need to add a shim in here to turn RAKUAST on and off per test file before invocation

[20:53] *** sena_kun left
[22:16] <lizmat> you need to add use v6.e.PREVIEW ?
