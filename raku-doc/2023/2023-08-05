[09:49] <lizmat> hmmm... looks like "is rw" and "is raw" is not documented on parameters

[10:17] <NemokoschKiwi> an idea about managing doc issues: since changes don't get pushed immediately, perhaps there could be a "pending" label or something similar. Everything with that label could be closed (or moved into some "final confirmation" state) on a new push

[10:23] <NemokoschKiwi> lizmat: https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Parameter_traits_and_modifiers one can come across it but not in the reference...

[11:00] <lizmat> thanks!

[13:38] <[Coke]> (pending) yup, good idea.

[13:59] <[Coke]> Just close once pushed, we don't have a full ticket workvflow with "ready for testing", etc.

[14:34] <NemokoschKiwi> Something will probably remain hand work but if people who can push know about this, it's really easier

[14:35] <NemokoschKiwi> Or if it's possible to query when an issue got updated

[15:49] <NemokoschKiwi> same question as in the comment: https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/2696

[15:49] <NemokoschKiwi> it seems like mere noise at this point
