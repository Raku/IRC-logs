[22:51] <[Coke]> I think we could, sure.

[23:10] <[Coke]> how much prep work to combine? One big page or maybe a few?

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Remove numeric comparison operators from DateTime

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: The numeric comparison operators were previously documented here because they were specifically implemented for this type.

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: However, this changed with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/72856df91b2e1cafb439bcd8bcc7ae46c378d01e .

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Now, the fact that this type can be used with these operators is simply a natural consequence of the provided coercion.

[23:32] <[Coke]> doc question: A feature existed and was removed. Should it be a) removed entirely, b) left in place but marked somehow, c) moved to a special section (end of doc, new doc) for removed.

[23:34] <[Coke]> ... ah, the situation isn't what I thought, I thought it was renamed earlier and then entirely removed. it was just the old name that was removed.
