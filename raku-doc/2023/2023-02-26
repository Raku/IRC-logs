[01:25] <cfa> i'll file an issue shortly but: 

[01:26] <cfa> aside from the formatting code issue, the highlighter is inserting spaces in normal code blocks

[01:27] <cfa> compare https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Positional_adverbs with https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/regexes.html#Positional_adverbs

[01:28] <cfa> most of the examples on the regexes page are "respaced" in this way

[04:09] <cfa> this seems to be from padding on the section class

[20:34] * [Coke] is sorry that I am not explaining myself. Trying to get past my initial reaction of "look, I've already said this X times, not sure how much more clear I can be.", trying to come up with a way that is more clear. Wondering if anyone aside from nemokosch is having trouble understanding my position.

[20:38] <[Coke]> My only other comment at the moment would just be repeating it again, which clearly didn't work the first n times.

[20:40] <[Coke]> The tone on the discussion is very draining for me to deal with, so I will ask for some patience. I'd rather focus my limited energies on getting the new website deployed.

[20:42] <[Coke]> segue to: coleman - there are currently no blockers listed for the go live, and the "pick a random date" that I picked for the deployment to give us a target is.. today

[20:43] <[Coke]> I don't see any tickets or PRs open on that milestone - do you have any issues left?

[20:46] <coleman> I can cut over tonight if the dev site looks acceptable

[20:46] <coleman> I have no other blockers other than it being acceptable to someone besides me :)

[20:47] <coleman> I'll work on getting it set up

[20:47] <[Coke]> I'm happy. You know as soon as we go live we'll get 50 tickets.

[20:47] <coleman> Actually a Good Thing, right?!!

[20:48] <[Coke]> Once live, we'll get automatic updates from raku/doc... what about raku/doc-website? Do we have to be careful that things we merge to main will go live in that 30m window?

[20:48] <[Coke]> Or do you have to push a button? (Either way is OK for initial go live as long as we know)

[20:48] <coleman> I'll make it not automatic

[20:49] <coleman> Give me a few hours. I'll report back.

[20:49] <[Coke]> Sounds good. Is there an infra page or a doc-website wiki page that details the situation and/maybe future plans?

[20:49] <[Coke]> coleman++ # I owe you a coffee.

[20:52] <[Coke]> I have another milestone for both raku/doc-website and raku/doc for end of March. If you're looking for something to help out with (that's to everyone), please look at those tickets first.

[20:52] <[Coke]> for doc-website, it's slightly more urgent items, for doc, it's an assortment of tickets, some new, some old, some docs, some meta.

[20:59] <coleman> Thanks for organizing those tickets

[21:05] <[Coke]> of course.

[21:06] <[Coke]> That's the easy bit. :)

[21:45] <Geth> ¦ doc: tbrowder++ created pull request #4215: Modify the 'Brackets' table generator to read the data source file

[21:45] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4215

[22:03] <tbrowder> [Coke]: my PR is more than a few changes, thus the need for a merge conflict resolution. the generated table should have all the test-failure faults fixed. the file has also been reorganized and cleaned up considerably.

[22:04] <tbrowder> and also better documented

[22:18] <[Coke]> ... did you update before submitting the PR?

[22:19] <[Coke]> Or does that conflict with the changes I made?

[22:25] <[Coke]> it does. I've already merged your old PR, and made changes *in the repo* - you'll need to update, and base your changes off the *current* version, not the old version.

[22:25] <[Coke]> keeping in mind, I already made several of these changes.

[22:25] <[Coke]> (removing whitespace, switching to $*PROGRAM...)

[22:26] <[Coke]> I had already fixed all the test failures.

[22:34] <[Coke]> Sorry I stepped on your work there, I am used to fixing things "in post" when it comes to PRs that are not part of raku/doc.

[22:36] <coleman> Taking this to production shortly: http://162.55.32.42:8080/types.html

[22:36] <coleman> (meaning it'll be behind TLS and pointed to by docs.raku.org)

[22:47] <coleman> DNS is updated

[22:54] <coleman> [Coke] you will be able to view these stats, and others with infra access https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects/2106628/loadbalancers/1129043/overview

[22:54] <coleman> I'm going to work on some documentation of this setup, and then expose an update mechanism

[23:03] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: a6fb41939c | (Richard Hainsworth)++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | Website/structure-sources/about.rakudoc

[23:03] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: New about page (#143)

[23:03] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/commit/a6fb41939c

[23:06] <[Coke]> WOOT

[23:06] <[Coke]> coleman++, it's live!

[23:06] <[Coke]> Thanks to everyone who helped get this over the line.

[23:10] <coleman> go team

[23:12] <coleman> I will be online for a few more hours. @ me or email me if you see anything urgent

[23:12] <coleman> I'll tag you on the PR to Raku/infra with documentation 

[23:12] <Geth> ¦ doc-website: finanalyst self-assigned generated from is not linking to the reflog  https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/145

[23:24] <lizmat> initial request produced a faulty pages, a forced reload fixed it

[23:24] <lizmat> guess some caches will get confused

[23:24] <lizmat> other than that: looks great!   congrats to the doc team!

[23:41] <coleman> [Coke] Here's a button you can click https://buildkite.com/raku/deploy-website-prod

[23:42] <coleman> I'll work on something accessible to more folks soon
