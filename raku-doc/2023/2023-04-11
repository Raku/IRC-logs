[18:12] <[Coke]> anyone see any issues if a .rakudoc extension implied the --doc command line arg?

[18:13] <[Coke]> (currently it treats it like .raku and runs the code)

[18:15] <Voldenet> maybe you could make extensions map configurable via env vars

[18:16] <lizmat> Voldenet: OOC what other extension -> functionality mapping do you have in mind?

[18:16] <Voldenet> RAKUDO_FILE_EXTENSIONS=raku:code,rakudoc:doc,rakumod:mod,p6:code,pod6:doc,pm6:mod

[18:17] <Voldenet> something likee that perhaps

[18:17] <lizmat> what different functionality would mod have ?

[18:17] <lizmat> from code I mean

[18:18] <Voldenet> theoretically it would indicate a module, I didn't think this too much though

[18:18] <Voldenet> s/think this/think this through/

[18:19] <Voldenet> RAKUDO_FILE_EXTENSIONS=rakudoc:doc,pod6:doc,*:code

[18:19] <Voldenet> I doubt anyone would ever need to change this either way

[18:22] <[Coke]> I wouldn't want to make this an env var.

[18:22] <lizmat> I think hardcoding .rakudoc --> --doc for now, would give us ample feedback

[18:23] <[Coke]> envisioning someone turning on code execution when you weren't expecting it.

[18:44] <Voldenet> I don't feel strongly about that â€“ env var can be added when someone needs it (which is never)
