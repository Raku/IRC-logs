[00:44] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: not all changes were transfered to resolve issue #300

[00:44] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[00:44] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - the changes made to plugins for new-raku were not all transferred to doc-website. So, the annoying double scroll bar did not disappear.

[03:20] <coleman> Deployed prod https://buildkite.com/raku/deploy-website-prod/builds/27

[03:35] <coleman> For the past couple of weeks prod has been deploying on it's own. I accidentally left the cron job running that is supposed to be what happens on dev only

[03:36] <coleman> I've turned it off. Deploys to prod will have to be explicit again. Coke, Richard, myself, and Liz have access to "click the button"

[03:37] <coleman> No one said anything, but the result was dev === prod for a couple of weeks :D

[03:39] <coleman> the deploy has been pretty reliable. but you can feel free to @ me if you want to click it while I'm around.

[09:38] <Nemokosch> coleman: not to be too pushy but can you maybe give a heads-up on the raku.org upgrade?

[09:59] <lizmat> something feels wrong with formatting on the doc site today

[09:59] <lizmat> text keeps disappearing from the righthand side of the window

[15:47] <[Coke]> coleman: (dev==prod) oops! good catch.

[15:48] <[Coke]> and we know we had one change (since fixed) that 

[15:48] <[Coke]> and that would explain liz's comment based on finanlysts two PRs. (the first one was only half done)

[16:25] <[Coke]> need a doc note that some labels are not allowed because they conflict with "reserved words" like CALLER and OUTER
