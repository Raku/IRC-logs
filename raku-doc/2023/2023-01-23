[00:52] <[Coke]> documentation@raku.org is on that thread and also complaining like liz's old address.

[01:02] <Nemokosch> Has anybody succeeded hosting an instance of the doc website? I'm getting horrible "malformed request" stack traces from Cro whenever I try to access it.

[01:18] <Nemokosch> Oh okay, this could have been expected... it's only running over HTTP

[01:18] <Nemokosch> and hence the HTTPS encoded request blew up

[01:21] <[Coke]> I'm still trying to get all the pre-reqs installed on an m2 mac.

[01:21] <[Coke]> If you find a blocker on the instructions, please open an issue.

[01:51] <[Coke]> ugh, apparently vm sitch on m2 is not great either. probably should fire up a linux box in azure.

[01:54] <Nemokosch> there were some missing folders that Richard fixed + this gotcha with HTTPS

[01:55] <Nemokosch> sometimes the side bar goes broken, don't quite know when

[17:43] <coleman> I haven't run it successfully yet, either. I'll take another look tonight.

[17:45] <coleman> coke I have an m1 mini (1st gen) that my work bought me to test funky builds

[17:45] <coleman> Don't tell my boss, but I use it to watch movies. I can ssh into it, though

[17:46] <coleman> Linux is our first priority since it's what will get deployed (x86_64 architecture, to be clear)

[17:47] <coleman> But a background initiative I'd like to spearhead after docs site is done would be a survey of pipelines for core deps

[17:47] <coleman> I am curious how others do it

[17:48] <coleman> Diversity in build environments is good, in my opinion. It finds bugs. The trouble is that those bugs are often not high priority (and quite sensibly so)

[17:48] <coleman> I'm thinking out loud. Back to my day job.
