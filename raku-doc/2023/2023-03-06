[01:52] <cfa> [Coke]: candidate for a test 👆

[02:02] <[Coke]> Not sure if we can easily check, maybe look at the raw table source for C<>'s ?

[02:03] <[Coke]> OMG, I just spent an hour trying to figure out why this wasn't working, I had a "next" inside a subroutine instead of a routine, and it was apparently next'ing through the for loop in the caller.

[02:03] <[Coke]> instead of a return, I mean.

[02:15] <[Coke]> Will no doubt be some false positives there.

[02:15] <cfa> neat

[02:16] <cfa> and yeah, i think a type page for Foo will often have an opening paragraph mentioning bare C<Foo>

[02:16] <cfa> i guess those could self link

[02:16] <[Coke]> That'd be fine, or we could check if we're on that page.

[02:17] <cfa> yeah, might be nicer

[02:17] <[Coke]> thinks like C<Raku> will be problematic, maybe.

[02:17] <[Coke]> currently 4060 failures.

[02:17] <cfa> here's an issue

[02:18] <cfa> i think you'll want to convert the candidate type Foo::Bar to Foo/Bar before doing the path check

[02:18] <cfa> btw, is there a documented trap for that `next` case you ran into?

[02:19] <[Coke]> that brings it to 4598 failures. :)

[02:23] <[Coke]> cfa, There's never been a consistent effort to clean this up

[02:23] <cfa> sure

[02:23] <[Coke]> so it's basically "nearly every time we reference a type"

[02:23] <cfa> i guess i'm just surprised that there're 4.5k bare type mentions in the docs

[02:23] <[Coke]> Note that this doesn't do anything about when it just appears as is inside a paragraph.

[02:24] <[Coke]> Could also be the test isn't right. :)

[14:53] <[Coke]> What's our desired link style for Foo::Bar types? /type/Foo/Bar or /type/Foo::Bar? website supports both, path separator is more natural for source, :: is more natural for users, probably.

[14:54] <[Coke]> we can use this test on type-links branch to push towards either.

[16:01] *** cfa joined
[16:14] <lizmat> if you ask me: I'd prefer /type/Foo::Bar

[16:14] <[Coke]> ok, two votes for ::, one for /

[16:15] <[Coke]> (based on #raku convo)

[16:15] <lizmat> yeah, just saw that

[16:15] <[Coke]> I dipped my toes in, now I'm done. :)

[16:15] <cfa> +1 to Foo::Bar

[16:27] <cfa> [Coke]: i'm just testing automated replacement of C<Str> and L<Str> here:

[16:27] <cfa> one other point to bear in mind -- we often have stuff like 'the C<Str> method'

[16:27] <cfa> which we don't want to link to the type page

[16:27] <cfa> (rather that should be a #method_Str link)

[16:35] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/96dbf7cd6f

[16:36] <[Coke]> Sure, we can make these smarter. Might end up having to declare what *those* links should look like as well.

[16:36] <[Coke]> like, it should probably be L<C<Str> method|/type/Int#method_Str>, etc.

[16:37] <[Coke]> if we put the method inside the link text, we avoid the false positive on this test.

[16:37] <[Coke]> maybe we can then write a test for the *method* links.

[16:37] <[Coke]> ok with cfa & lizmat, we're at 3 to 1, I pushed a version that prefers the ::'s

[16:38] <lizmat> [Coke]++

[16:38] <[Coke]> before merging this, I am going to squash some commits here. Maybe we have one commit to add the script, and one for any updates to docs to pass tests.

[16:38] <[Coke]> Wonder what else is in the backlog that we could be writing xts for.

[16:59] <cfa> 👍

[17:04] <[Coke]> only 41 instances of that one, and half are things like <*> that should probabyl be C<< <*> >>

[17:07] <cfa> i've yet to render these changes but please take a look at https://github.com/cfa/doc/commit/4be822 for a first (automated) pass

[17:11] <[Coke]> nice!

[17:13] <cfa> added Seq updates too, https://github.com/Raku/doc/compare/main...cfa:doc:expand-type-links

[17:14] <cfa> oh whoops

[17:15] <lizmat> Q: has the doc site recently been updated ?

[17:16] <lizmat> I don't see the entry for "nano" yet

[17:16] <lizmat> wondering whether that is to be expected or not

[17:17] <cfa> [Coke]: Str, Seq and Nil expansions are in that branch

[17:18] <cfa> testing rendering now to eyeball some of these; please re-run your latest test if you get a chance to see what the impact is

[17:18] <cfa> (i picked the top 3 types from the count i made yesterday)

[17:18] <cfa> lizmat: i don't think so

[17:19] <lizmat> ok, check  :-)

[17:19] <cfa> https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/terms.html#term_nano

[17:19] <cfa> it's here

[17:19] <cfa> but i think the main docs site is outdated by a few days

[17:19] <lizmat> ok, good to know  :-)

[17:20] <[Coke]> type test is buggy on case insensitive FS.

[17:21] <[Coke]> if docs-devlooks ok, will push now

[17:24] <[Coke]> cfa, added the change so type ref on that type's page expects only C<>

[17:24] <cfa> thanks

[17:24] <cfa> the substitution/expansion isn't intelligent so these changes will violate that i'm sure

[17:25] <lizmat> cfa: oddly enough, the search on that URL doesn't know about "nano" yet?

[17:26] <cfa> not sure how the search index is generated

[17:26] <cfa> [Coke, any ideas?

[17:26] <cfa> [Coke]*

[17:27] <[Coke]> I see it

[17:28] <cfa> it's not autocompleting for me

[17:28] <[Coke]> refresh try again? it's statically generated, so if you had doc site open when I pushed it wouldn't be there.

[17:28] <[Coke]> this may also be related to the "are we overeagerly caching" issue.

[17:28] <cfa> i think my browser has cached the index

[17:28] <cfa> works in an incognito window

[17:30] <[Coke]> can you open a ticket on website going through the steps?

[17:30] <[Coke]> I think we need a cache buster when deploying.

[17:34] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/207

[17:34] <cfa> hopefully that's clear

[17:36] <cfa> [Coke]: glancing at the Str page, built from the expand-type-links branch, i'm not sure self-links are actually that problematic

[17:36] <cfa> perhaps they incorrectly suggest a link to a different page though

[17:39] <cfa> anyway, PTAL

[17:40] <cfa> (back in a bit)

[17:45] <[Coke]> I'm fine with self-links being actual links; only a slight preference for no

[18:01] <cfa> knocked them out of that branch

[18:05] <[Coke]> ok

[18:14] <cfa> pushed expansions of Pair and List

[18:14] <cfa> that should be enough for testing
