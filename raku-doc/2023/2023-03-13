[13:51] <lizmat> [Coke]++ good catch  :-)

[13:55] <[Coke]> I actually had committed that locally on a different box than I normally work on days ago and forgot to push.

[13:55] <[Coke]> proof that I am trying to play editor for these updates!

[13:55] <[Coke]> my cat: MEW MEOW MOW RAR AWOW

[13:58] * lizmat completely agrees with cat  :-)

[15:39] <coleman> [Coke] That was me re: the billing. I'm buying some minutes so we don't get disruption. Over the next few months we'll centralize this CI in line with other core projects

[15:40] <coleman> I think I want to revisit Sparrow for this!

[15:41] <coleman> But I don't want to just bind the Sparrow administration to your Github account, or mine, or Liz's. I'd like to ask for some special-handling on the backend, or self-host an instance, something like that

[19:37] <lizmat> from https://social.sdf.org/@mjgardner/110016366333211053  sometimes I think we maybe need a curated subsection of Raku in a separate area

[19:37] <lizmat> a bit like the nutshell pages, but more general
