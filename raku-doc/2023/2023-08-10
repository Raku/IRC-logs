[13:51] <[Coke]> crud, I haven't made a checklist ticket post-release in a few releases.

[14:55] <[Coke]> ah, 2023.02 was the last one

[14:55] <[Coke]> so just missing .04, .05, .06

[14:56] <[Coke]> anyone wants to take a stab at creating a ticket like https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4209 for those, please speak up here (otherwise, this weekend)

[15:26] <[Coke]> Wonder if we could use a script to parse through a changelog announcement and create the ticket.
