[00:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: This commit replaces the "Subroutine declaration" section with a

[00:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: "Callable declarations" section, which now contains sub-sections on

[00:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: "Subroutine declaration", "Multiple dispatch subroutine declaration",

[00:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: "Block declaration", "Method declaration", and "Multiple-dispatch

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: issue #309 reports a redundant link, patch removes it

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - the source file `5to6-nutshell` contains the heading `C<constant>` that matches the regex looking for composite files, but this is a false positive as no name is generated

[00:55] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - this patch to the `Website/plugins/secondaries` verifies `.name` is non-blank.

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: resolves issue #303

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - users want to be able to auxiliary (for Ubuntu = right) mouse-click and for the url to be opened in a new tab while remaining in the current tab.

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - users do not want the position within the list of found candidates to be affected by key entries, which means the position in the list state is also unchanged by cancelling a search or a change in focus.

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - for security reasons, 'pop-unders' are made very difficult in javascript

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - but browsers all allow this behaviour for HTML links (eg `<a>` tabs).

[00:57] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - users want to have `select` meaning the 'Enter' and left mouse-button to operate as before.
