[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Improve ff() examples (#4329)

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: - Add an element to the beginning and end of the arrays

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:   used in the ff() (and related) examples. This is to also

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:   show the main feature of ff() when the read looks for

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:   specific usage examples.

[18:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/5d050f335c

[18:25] <[Coke]> lizmat: looks like some new failures on rakuast-compare test. I just rebuilt with moar-latest and they're still there.

[18:25] <lizmat> yeah... looking at them right now

[18:25] <lizmat> almost clean again :-)

[18:26] <lizmat> a decision was made to make :allow a purely renderer thing, rather than a thing that also affects parsing

[18:26] <lizmat> this implied that any codepoint with :Lu uniprop is now legal as a markup starter

[18:27] <lizmat> but this also means that the legacy podifier needs some adjustments

[18:27] <lizmat> working on that now

[18:27] <lizmat> also: it appears that my margin refactoring exposed some faulty pod / expectations

[18:28] <[Coke]> cool

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: d6c96d375f | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | 3 files

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Fix expectations about =for code

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: =for code

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:     zippo

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: The legacy grammar incorrectly produces a Pod::Code object with

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: "    zippo" wheras the indentation of =for should be deducted

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: <…commit message has 5 more lines…>

[19:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/d6c96d375f

[19:44] <lizmat> that's one set of issues fixed

[19:46] <lizmat> the other one is related to markup inside the meta area of a L<>

[19:50] <lizmat> inside a code block allowing some markup

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: b4709779bf | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | doc/Language/pod.rakudoc

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Remove use of B<> markup in code block for now

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Need to look at the ramifications of this further, but want the

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: tests to be clean now.

[19:54] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/b4709779bf

[19:55] <lizmat> [Coke] with this and the latest Rakudo commit, the doc tests should be clean again

[19:56] <lizmat> there's still an issue with things like: L<B<foo> bar | baz C<zippo>> which I will look at tomorrow

[19:57] <lizmat> when fixed, this could possible make the last doc commit redundant, but am not sure of that

[19:57] <lizmat> and with that, my hacking for today come to an end&

[20:24] <[Coke]> lizmat++

[21:14] <[Coke]> lizmat: some of the failures are because %*ENV<PATH> is now rendering as %*ENPATH

[21:14] <[Coke]> which is implied by what you said, but wanted to call that out specifically (since it then causes aspell failures)

[22:27] <lizmat> do you mean you still see errors?

[22:28] *** sena_kun left
[22:31] <[Coke]> need to retest.

[22:31] <[Coke]> will do so now

[22:36] <lizmat> it was just clean for me on HEAD

[22:38] <lizmat> please create a gist if it fails, will look tomorrow

[22:38] <lizmat> but now sleep&

[23:09] <[Coke]> yah, not clean, working on a gist
