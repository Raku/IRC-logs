[08:45] <lizmat> synthetics issue fixed, down to 3

[09:26] <lizmat> the remaining three all break on the same (known) issue, namely that somehow the internals of an =begin code / =end code block are actually interpreted as if pod

[09:26] <lizmat> when it should be handled verbatim

[09:26] <lizmat> this is a grammar issue, and I have not been able to fix that yet

[09:27] <lizmat> a temporary solution: deparsing the inside of the =begin code / =end code in podifying, is syntactically and semantically correct

[09:27] <lizmat> but not the same as the original generally (byte for byte)

[09:27] <lizmat> e.g. =for foo is deparsed as =begin foo / =end foo

[09:28] <lizmat> as there is no functional difference between =for foo and =begin foo / =end foo: the =for just makes it easier to indicate the end (first empty line)

[09:30] <lizmat> first: the weekly
