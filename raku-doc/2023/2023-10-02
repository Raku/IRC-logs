[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - searching for one of the above yields candidates that are named, eg.`routine/.`, but a page gets a 404.

[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - after some testing on various browsers/OS, it seems that those three specific character sequences cannot be used as filenames everywhere. Browsers/OS modify the URL before it reaches the server

[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - To overcome this behaviour, the three composite filenames `.` `..` `\` are mapped to URLs that will be preserved.

[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - This patch only affects three filenames and does not affect any other name.

[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - This problem was also present in the Documentable build of the website.

[09:18] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_special_filenames: - patch changes `secondaries` plugin to create the url, and place the url in the podf structure. The `options-search` plugin is modified to pick up the url from the podf structure instead of forming the name by a rule.

[09:23] <finanalyst> [Coke]: now that the search refactoring has been merged, what should happen to all the issues with the SEARCH label?

[09:23] <finanalyst> Can I close them all as completed?

[09:24] <finanalyst> Or do you want to go through them to see that they have been fully addressed?

[11:27] <[Coke]> For big stuff, it's good to have a reviewer separate from the implementor; I can review them.

[16:22] <coleman> finanalyst: maybe leave a comment on the issues that ought to be closed to start with?

[16:22] <[Coke]> Sure, and feel free to assign them to me.

[20:40] <NemokoschKiwi> Is there anybody who self-hosts an instance of the website for testing purposes? Is it possible that it reaches 6GB RAM during the secondary generation and never lets go of this memory?

[20:44] <Geth> ¦ doc-website: coke self-assigned Matches in Language should get priority https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/222

[20:49] <NemokoschKiwi> it's suspicious that it shouldn't use gigabytes of memory, I wonder if it's an environmental thing or there really is some serious resource leakage
