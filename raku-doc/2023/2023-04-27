[13:06] <[Coke]> What's the advntage to making rakudoc a slang? it still needs to run on any raku source, yes?

[16:37] <lizmat> the advantage is that someone could make their own grammar and used the rakudoc slang in it

[16:50] <[Coke]> +1

[16:54] <lizmat> alas, I've decided to no longer pursue that, at least for now

[16:55] <lizmat> I found some weird pod anomalies in roast

[16:55] <lizmat> = DESCRIPTION

[16:55] <lizmat> was that ever valid pod ?

[16:55] <lizmat> pod6?

[16:55] <lizmat> (note the space between the = and D

[16:56] <[Coke]> I don't think so?

[16:58] <lizmat> well, it occurs in 4 test files, and only one actually checks for its contents in =pod

[16:58] <lizmat> $=pod
