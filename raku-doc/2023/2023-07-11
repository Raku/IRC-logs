[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Better handling of unknown languages for hiliting / styling of copy button (#267)

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Hilight-js bundles 32 common languages + Haskell.

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Our highlighter handles Raku and Rakudoc

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Some sources have `=code :lang<XXX>` where XXX is not in set above. The formatting is messed up.

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: If a lang is not set, then its Raku. If a lang is in set above, then highlights-js. If a lang neither, then no highlighting.

[09:54] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Github had code copy buttons that only appear when source is hovered over. Restyled button to do the same.
