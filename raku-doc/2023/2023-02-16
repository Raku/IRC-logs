[16:54] <[Coke]> coleman: saw some chat that if you get ssh access to a thing, we have a workable solution for deployment?

[16:54] <[Coke]> (and CI-ish updates on content)

[17:04] <coleman> Yep

[17:05] <coleman> I tried to do it with Portainer but it was a bummer

[17:05] <coleman> Worst case, I'll launch a server myself and sponsor it for a while

[17:05] <coleman> I'll get it done before the end of the month. Rest assured. I'd just like to use the existing infra.

[17:06] <[Coke]> mmm

[17:07] <coleman> As for content updates, we can use the same cron strategy on our existing build in Raku/doc-website

[17:07] <coleman> since the build script actually pulls in the content updates anyway

[17:09] *** coleman sets mode: +o [Coke]

[18:54] <coleman> andinus gave me ssh to dev

[18:55] <coleman> [Coke] you can see the hourly build of doc-website container here https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/settings/schedules

[18:55] <coleman> just set it up

[18:56] <coleman> I set it up this afternoon, rather

[18:56] <coleman> This will keep content updated, too, I believe

[18:57] <coleman> Until we get a content-CI installed, too

[19:22] <[Coke]> is the hourly build also updating the *site code*, or just the content?

[19:23] <[Coke]> looks like the latter. Nifty.

[20:31] <coleman> merges to main on the site code are immediately updated in the container

[20:31] <coleman> the periodic build updates content, because the build scripts themselves pull from the tip of the content repo

[20:32] <coleman> so it's kind of an accident that it works

[20:32] <coleman> better than nothing, though

[20:50] <[Coke]> so any commits to master automatically go live on doc/web-site

[20:50] <[Coke]> ?

[20:51] <[Coke]> raku/doc-website, I mean.

[20:52] <coleman> the CONTAINER is rebuilt. I have to implement auto-deploy with systemd+cron

[20:53] <coleman> Portainer didn't work out. I'm okay with that, though. I kind of prefer this simpler task.

[20:54] <coleman> The way it will work is every 30 minutes on the dev server, the cron job will pull and restart the latest instance of quay.io/colemanx/raku-doc-website

[20:54] <coleman> and that container will itself be rebuilt hourly at the latest.

[20:56] <[Coke]> ok. At this point, I'd be happy with ANY kind of refresh schedule, so if we need to make that less frequently, that's probably fine too. (in case it eats $$)

[20:58] <[Coke]> Thanks to coleman & sena_kun & everyone again for getting us there!

[21:20] <coleman> My pleasure

[21:52] <rf> Can we tie in generating CSS to also be run when we build the site

[21:52] <rf> I hate running 2 commands lol
