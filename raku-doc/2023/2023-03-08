[00:36] <[Coke]> With finanlyst offline for a bit, I'm thinking we should skip the call this saturday; I think we're doing a great job communicating here and via github.

[00:36] <[Coke]> Let me know if anyone feels otherwise.

[13:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/02c89783b9

[13:59] <[Coke]> that last one about Map - duck typing or actual typing?

[14:00] <lizmat> it only *acts* as a Map polymorphically

[14:00] <[Coke]> Quack.

[14:00] <lizmat> only the .enums method actually returns a  Map

[14:00] <lizmat> m: say Bool ~~ Map

[14:00] <lizmat> my... Camelia is slow today

[14:01] <[Coke]> is there a vim key sequence to generate a NL char?

[14:01] <lizmat> no standard way afaik

[14:01] <[Coke]> I learned NBSP very early when working on docs, have << and >> (of course, my shortcut is in vim, not irssi...)

[14:01] <[Coke]> ok. maybe we want to make a "how to config vim if you work on the docs" wiki page or something. :)

[14:02] <lizmat> yes, I would like that  :-)

[14:02] <[Coke]> put in the standard unicode chars we have to deal with.

[14:02] <lizmat> Ah, I guess Camelia doesn't frequent this channel

[14:07] <[Coke]> probably make sense to invite her.

[14:19] <[Coke]> updated with notes on how to add ␤ as ^K n l

[14:20] <[Coke]> Will add this as a .md to the github/doc repo later.

[14:20] <[Coke]> Any other common unicode we're using in the docs?

[14:21] <[Coke]> I need to setup a .vimrc I can put in my github dot-files and include from a system's ~/.vimrc

[14:21] <[Coke]> get my config in order across all systems finally.

[14:49] <[Coke]> wow, that was too easy.

[18:55] <[Coke]> any thoughts on the con call this saturday? I'm still very OK with skipping it now that we have a ryhthm going.

[18:56] <[Coke]> coleman, esp.: anything that needs face to face?

[18:58] <[Coke]> (I'll send out an email on the thread from last month in a bit unless I hear back)

[21:27] <[Coke]> Done. everyone gets their saturday back. :)

[23:31] <NemokoschKiwi> hello

[23:32] <NemokoschKiwi> https://docs.raku.org/language/compilation#$*REPO

[23:32] <NemokoschKiwi> There are some snippets that show up as e.g B<@INC>

[23:32] <NemokoschKiwi> apparently because the source nests C and B tags

[23:33] <NemokoschKiwi> what is wrong? the input or the output? :)

[23:34] <[Coke]> good question. Can you open a ticket on raku/docs - if it turns out to be something in the renderer, we can move the ticket

[23:34] <[Coke]> Good catch, thanks.

[23:40] <NemokoschKiwi> roger that

[23:43] <[Coke]> ... which is how I found out that rakudoc is fine with .rakudoc extensions. :)

[23:52] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc/issues/24 - could use a new rakudoc release if someone is familiar with the tooling there.
