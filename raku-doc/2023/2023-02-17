[16:42] <[Coke]> there are definitely a lot more changes between the two sites than just the styling.

[16:43] <[Coke]> #104, #105, #86...

[16:44] <[Coke]> I suspect there are many more. I wonder if a crawler to show us all the pages reachable by links on both sites would be a pre-req to go live; This sort of thing is harder to see if the links work but subtly change the URLs.
