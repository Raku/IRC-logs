[14:46] <[Coke]> 28 tickets left in milestone 1, 10 days left. We've closed so many, I'm OK even if we don't close any others before month end, but would love to get that number lower. (To be fair, I've been adding some small ones)

[21:13] <tbrowder__>  hi. i know how  to get a modules version from the local one in its repo. BUT how do i get it from the installed version? the docs are a bit confusing to me.

[21:18] <tbrowder__> the docs say this "say $?DISTRIBUTION.meta<ver>;" but it doesn't work for me

[21:35] <[Coke]> What do you need it for?

[21:37] <[Coke]> are you using it in the context of a distribution? How are you invoking it?

[21:38] <[Coke]> works here.

[21:38] <[Coke]> I have a clone of my repo, and run: 'raku -I. bin/somescript' that is using ./lib/App/some/lib.rakumod - I get the output

[21:39] <[Coke]> if you don't have the context of distro (here I get it by adding -I. which loops in the META6.json), I imagine it's always empty

[21:39] <[Coke]> (if I use -Ilib instead, I get a ver of "*" instead of the correct 1.0.3)

[21:40] <[Coke]> ... and I see ugexe covered this already in #raku, sorry
