[13:07] <[Coke]> updated Raku/rakudoc to just send here, not #raku

[13:08] <lizmat> :-)   yeah I was spamming #raku a bit I guess

[13:09] <[Coke]> I just had it redeliver a PR assignment, didn't show up

[13:09] <[Coke]> we get ticket assignments, right? do we get PRs?

[13:11] <[Coke]> Looks like rakudoc maybe used to support 'rakudoc Str' or 'Rakudoc Str.chars' but now you have to use 'rakudoc Type/Str' to basically look at the file.

[13:13] <[Coke]> Any lurkers want to take that on, let me know. :)

[13:14] <[Coke]> we also need a release to get a version out there that doesn't spew deprecation warnings.

[13:16] <[Coke]> lizmat: should I mark all the checklist tickets in the current milestone?

[13:16] <[Coke]> (expected to be completed by the end of the month?)

[13:16] <lizmat> yes, that should be doable

[13:16] <[Coke]> WOOT

[13:23] <[Coke]> put them all into Q1, closed all the tickets where the checklists were done and there were no questions in the thread.

[16:04] <[Coke]> last commit on rakudoc before my deprecation fix was in 2021, guessing we've lost the original authors.

[17:24] <cfa> ðŸ‘‹

[17:25] <cfa> lizmat: i think this signature needs to be updated (source after variadic parameters)

[17:26] <cfa> (in 2023.02, i see two rotor signatures: `(Int:D $batch, \thing, *%_)` and `(**@cycle-and-thing, *%_)`)

[17:27] <cfa> oh,  whoops, forgot the link: https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/doc/Type/List.rakudoc#L1211

[18:32] <cfa> this is odd:

[18:32] <cfa> https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/subscripts#Zen_slices

[18:32] <cfa> "Zen slicing does not reification or cache..."

[18:32] <cfa> but the underlying pod is:

[18:32] <cfa> "Zen slicing does not L<reify|/language/glossary#index-entry-Reify> or L<cache|/routine/cache>"

[18:33] <cfa> the generated link text is incorrect

[18:33] <cfa> (the target needs updating but that can wait)

[18:36] <cfa> okay, it looks like links to the same target on the same page re-use the first link's link text

[18:36] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/doc/Type/DateTime.rakudoc#L114

[18:36] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/doc/Type/DateTime.rakudoc#L393

[18:37] <cfa> note "$*TZ variable" in https://docs.raku.org/type/DateTime#method_local

[18:43] <[Coke]> prefixed with "index_entry" else it'd work

[18:43] <cfa> that's not the issue
