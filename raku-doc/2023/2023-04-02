[16:37] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/add_generated_typegraphs: Raku/doc-website is missing the generated svg typegraphs. They should be generated at build time by the plugin `Website/plugins/typegraph`. The original logic was disrupted because a file `.placeholder` was inserted to keep the directory. The logic has been changed. If there are no typegraphs they will be generated in the build environment.
