[01:11] <[Coke]> cfa - if I was overzealous with some conversions to raku, please feel free to fix those.

[01:12] <[Coke]> I saw the user paths, and didn't realize that was the install path.

[01:12] <cfa> sure, i'll send a pr in a few minutes

[01:12] <[Coke]> maybe those should go back to the original, and wherever we mention the perl6/ install path, let's include the disclaimer.

[01:12] <[Coke]> Thanks!!

[01:12] <[Coke]> I should probably also be submitting PRs and not just pushing directly. Will endeavor to do so going forward.

[15:03] <cfa> those snitch examples currently fail to compile because there's no `use v6.e.PREVIEW` preamble

[15:29] <cfa> [Coke]: as part of the general renaming, i thought we might want to do this for the test suite, https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4246

[15:33] <lizmat> cfa++

[15:34] <cfa> it might be nice to replace `:solo :preamble<use v6.e.PREVIEW;>` with something like `:use<v6.e.PREVIEW>`

[15:34] <cfa> to make the boilerplate less clunky

[15:37] <lizmat> I wouldn't use ":use" as that could imply more general pragma / module thingies

[15:37] <lizmat> or is that what you would imply?

[15:37] <lizmat> like :use<Test> ?

[15:37] <cfa> the issue is making sure that the preamble is added in the correct place

[15:38] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/xt/examples-compilation.rakutest#L77

[15:39] <cfa> the :solo examples are more straightforward but if we want the other branch, we can't declare a 6.e requirement

[15:50] <cfa> yeah example compilation and spellcheck are both in "make xtest"

[15:50] <lizmat> so I should run both, or just "make xtest" ?

[15:50] <cfa> just make xtest

[16:45] <lizmat> :-)

[16:45] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3162

[16:46] <cfa> do we really want to just point to Str, or should the docs for Supply briefly summarise behaviour?

[16:46] <lizmat> yeah, I saw similar things today... will do that in another round

[16:46] <cfa> great

[16:46] <lizmat> I think if a method has a different behaviour in a class, we should keep it

[16:46] <cfa> yeah

[16:46] <lizmat> but there are only a few cases of them

[16:59] <cfa> checked off a few things in https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3104

[17:00] <cfa> pseudo-packages, raku and RAKUDO_HOME entries

[17:00] <cfa> but i think it's largely if not completely covered already

[17:03] <lizmat> is rakudoc still a thing ?

[18:28] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/bbfb1b158a

[18:30] <cfa> these doc updates from Geth are probably quite spammy in #raku

[18:30] <cfa> [Coke]: also, wow, util/update-and-test is really handy

[18:30] <cfa> especially on this slower machine

[18:31] <cfa> (auto-setting TEST_FILES is v. useful)

[18:35] <[Coke]> glad to hear it. back in the day when no one ran the tests it was super helpful

[18:50] <cfa> :)

[18:52] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: Adds license page to structure, and makes License in the footer a link to the page

[18:52] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: remove redundant sections from template

[18:53] <cfa> [Coke]: https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/doc/Type/List.pod6#L838-L839

[18:54] <cfa> might be worth adding a 'trailing whitespace inside C<>s' test

[18:54] <[Coke]> sure, give me 10m

[18:54] <cfa> (you can see the spacing issue on https://docs-dev.raku.org/type/List.html#routine_sort )

[18:55] <cfa> this one wraps so it's a little less trivial to pick up with a grep/ack/ag/rak

[18:56] <cfa> $ ag 'C<.*? >'

[18:56] <cfa> many false positives but a few good candidates too

[18:57] <cfa> again, linewise only

[19:04] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: C<> should not have leading or trailing whitespace

[19:04] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/f7725e1813

[19:05] <[Coke]> tons of failures.

[19:05] <lizmat> oh dear

[19:06] <[Coke]> eh. always happens with a new test. Figured I'd let cfa take first try.

[19:07] * [Coke] wonders if C<infix:<cmp> > is smart enough to work with C<infix:<cmp>>

[19:07] <lizmat> [Coke]: would be nice if it could give a line number

[19:08] <[Coke]> I'm walking the pod object, do we havel ine numbers at that point?

[19:08] <lizmat> not sure

[19:11] <lizmat> looks like a lot of cases of C< foo> as well

[19:12] <cfa> i guess we should double check there're no cases of foo C<bar >baz too

[19:12] <lizmat> interesting case: C<< <=> >>

[19:12] <cfa> hmm

[19:15] <cfa> does that render correctly?

[19:15] <cfa> looks like trailing space added but leading isn't

[19:15] <cfa> https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/5to6-perlop.html#Equality_operators

[19:16] <cfa> that's surprising in itself

[19:20] <cfa> and i suppose we can replace C<< <=> >> with C«<=>» and retain readability while fixing spacing

[19:20] <cfa> the latter is actually more readable, i think?

[19:25] <[Coke]> C<String>s is fine.

[19:25] <[Coke]> C<St>s is fine, I mean.

[19:25] <[Coke]> ... i give up. :)

[19:26] <cfa> entries like this are hard to read too

[19:27] <cfa> C<-> $line { ... } >

[19:27] <cfa> again C«-> $line { ... }» probably preferable?

[19:27] <cfa> C<+< > etc.

[19:28] <cfa> so part of this is whitespace, part of it is readability/maintainability

[19:28] <cfa> (stil eyeballing some of these results; don't have much time to actual make edits at the moment)

[19:32] <lizmat> :q!

[19:32] <lizmat> oops  :-)_

[21:59] <[Coke]> anyone in the middle of something? I can do the pod6 -> rakudoc rename if i'm clear.

[22:12] *** coleman joined
[22:22] <[Coke]> almost done.

[22:26] <cfa> 👍

[22:34] <[Coke]> WOOF

[22:35] <[Coke]> let's definitely make sure that works on docs-dev before next prod push

[22:37] <cfa> great

[22:38] * cfa rebuilds locally 

[22:39] <[Coke]> next test run will be slow as it's rebuilding all the pod-cache.

[22:39] <[Coke]> but I did finally delete the test to make sure there were no pod5 files.

[22:46] <cfa> i'll try and get to the C<> changes later today

[22:46] <cfa> glad we weren't working in parallel 

[22:46] <cfa> makes for less of a headache

[22:51] <cfa> anyway, afk again for a few hours 

[22:53] <coleman> Counted some 404s https://envs.sh/5V

[22:55] <coleman> The full logs have PII like people's IP addresses, but I'm going to document my scripts for fetching this

[22:55] <[Coke]> lets get that in front of richard.

[22:55] <coleman> will do

[22:56] <coleman> I'll upload this file to the ticket

[22:56] <[Coke]> coleman++

[22:56] <coleman> the ones prefixed "/syntax/*" seem like they should be legit

[22:57] <[Coke]> /language/nativetype looks like it might be missing some newlines?

[22:57] <[Coke]> (there's a very long linr)

[22:58] <[Coke]> we can add simple rules to support things like $COLON

[22:59] <[Coke]> 6    -> /language/regexes.html.html

[22:59] <[Coke]> ok, that's not our fault. :)

[23:00] <cfa> i think there's already a ticket re: /syntax links not working

[23:01] <[Coke]> yup, anything with syntax and routine can go there.

[23:01] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/181

[23:01] <cfa> oh coleman's on top of that issue already

[23:02] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/85#issuecomment-1454914971

[23:02] <cfa> coleman++

[23:02] <cfa> back later

[23:02] <cfa> &

[23:02] <coleman> Yeah, I added a relationship between the two issues

[23:04] <[Coke]> afk a bit
