[08:12] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: fixes issues #275 and #279 (#281)

[08:12] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[08:12] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: both issues stem from the same problem: text is included in a secondary file from a primary file from a level2 heading. But the section is terminated by a level1 heading, not a level2 heading. The fix is to look for leveln, n-1, n-2, n-3 headings. By specification of RakuDoc, only headings upto level 4 are distinguished.

[08:12] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: The regex should be made more generic, perhpas by recursion on level, decrementing it to 0, but I don't know how.

[15:24] <finanalyst> I have created two PRs on the doc-website repo. 1) a new plugin 2) enable plugin

[15:25] <[Coke]> Does this cover the first "split" we talked about on the call?

[15:25] <finanalyst> The effect of the change is in a docker file `inanalyst/new-raku-website:dev`

[15:26] <finanalyst> the docker file only has a minimal test set of documents, those that cause most problems

[15:26] <finanalyst> This PR is in line with agreement to create incremental changes

[15:28] <finanalyst> [Coke] yes this is the first split

[15:29] <finanalyst> tl;dr only a change to the underlying HTML, no change to Search

[15:30] <finanalyst> Even so, resizing the browser window to mobile size seems to me to be better.

[15:31] <finanalyst> I am not 100% happy with the result.

[15:33] <finanalyst> I can make changes to meet requests before the plugin is enabled

[15:34] <finanalyst> I will then update the docker container so you can see the result. 

[15:35] <finanalyst> When we have some consensus, the plugin can be enabled.

[15:36] <finanalyst> [Coke] I'd appreciate a Jitsi discussion about the search. I have some other ideas after the last discussion

[15:38] <finanalyst> Eg., We could put the search options only inside the right-hand hidden panel, and have the search input from the main screen

[15:42] <[Coke]> why does PR #2 also change 98 files?

[15:42] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/pull/284/files

[15:42] <[Coke]> I expected a minimal changeset there.
