[00:18] <rf> Looks good, good work folks!

[00:19] <raiph> Hmm. Has there been an attempt at the doc site switchover?

[00:20] <raiph> Is it expected that some/most links will 404 for a while?

[00:20] <raiph> For example: https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency#Supplies

[00:22] <raiph> OK, backlogging and I see there is something going on.

[00:23] <rf> Another issue is there are no typegraphs on the classes :O

[00:24] <raiph> Which is great news, but I just posted a comment with 6 links to major Raku features and 5 are 404ing.

[00:24] <raiph> Perhaps it's the caching issue I see liz mentioned?

[00:25] <raiph> (The comment is https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/11cpjcx/comment/ja5ht58/)

[00:26] <Geth> ¦ doc-website: coke assigned to dontlaugh Issue URLS shouldn't require .html https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/147

[00:27] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/147 -

[00:27] <[Coke]> coleman: this is the issue reported by ugexe and raiph. URLS currently require .html and shouldn't.

[00:28] <coleman> I'll take a look at a rewrite rule

[00:29] <[Coke]> Thanks!

[00:29] <raiph> Ah, well I think that'll break pretty much every doc link I've ever written. :)

[00:29] <coleman> womp womp

[00:33] <raiph> Yeah, quick search of my /r/programminglanguages comments shows it breaks all links for last year.

[00:35] <raiph> All doc links that is.

[00:35] <raiph>  My search for '.html' did match a dozen comments with links that end '.html' but they're not doc links.

[00:36] <raiph> But I'm find with every comment I've ever written being broken if docs are moving in the right direction. :)

[00:36] <raiph> s/find/fine/

[00:37] <[Coke]> Hopefully this will be a straightforward fix.

[00:37] <raiph> Hmm. Same will be true of all my StackOverflow answers.

[00:37] <[Coke]> Sorry, should have caught it before go live.

[00:37] <[Coke]> Yes. All links. I get it. :)

[00:37] <cfa> regarding the switchover, imo the stylesheet issue is fairly urgent

[00:37] <cfa> just take a look at https://docs.raku.org/type/Regex.html

[00:37] <raiph> Nothing to be sorry about, gotta be bold.

[00:37] <[Coke]> "the stylesheet issue" ?

[00:38] <[Coke]> #144?

[00:38] <cfa> yes

[00:39] <cfa> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes.html#Positional_adverbs

[00:39] <cfa> the majority of examples on that page are incorrectly rendered

[00:39] <cfa> and... it's a fairly significant piece of documentation

[00:40] <[Coke]> *how* incorrectly? The ticket indicates it's just a whitespace issue

[00:40] <[Coke]> Are you saying code is missing?

[00:40] <cfa> no, it's a spacing issue

[00:40] <cfa> but the examples are badly rendered

[00:40] <[Coke]> if it's just spacing, I don't think that's urgent.

[00:40] <[Coke]> define "badly"

[00:40] <cfa> hard to read 

[00:40] <[Coke]> Maybe doing a screen grab and highlighting the issue would help underscore how badly broken it is.

[00:40] <cfa> well take a look

[00:41] <cfa> it's obvious

[00:41] <[Coke]> cfa: looks fine here. Please take a screen shot, and include info on browser, port size, etc.

[00:41] <raiph> I just looked at it seems (relatively) great to me.

[00:41] <[Coke]> cfa: I'm telling you, it looks fine here.

[00:41] <raiph> I mean the spacing is weird.

[00:41] <[Coke]> so please take the screenshot and provide the sizing & browser info.

[00:41] <cfa> it looks the same in two browsers and isn't what's in the underlying code block

[00:41] <[Coke]> but looking at this in my browser: it's absolutely not urgent.

[00:42] <raiph> But cut/paste into glot.io worked fine.

[00:42] <cfa> https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes.html#Samecase

[00:42] <cfa> yes, it's css padding not insertion of additional spaces

[00:42] <cfa> so it'll copy out fine

[00:42] <cfa> it just renders poorly

[00:42] <raiph> Agree with Coke

[00:42] <cfa> it's a regression in readability of code examples

[00:42] <cfa> if you disagree that's fine; i've filed an issue and defer to you

[00:42] <[Coke]> cfa: pics or it didn't happen.

[00:43] * cfa sigh

[00:43] <raiph> :)

[00:43] <cfa> i spent time filing an issue already

[00:43] <[Coke]> and I can't do anything with it.

[00:43] <cfa> "or it didn't happen" is dismissive

[00:43] <[Coke]> I don't even know what browser you're on. what OS. it looks fine to me and someone else here.

[00:43] <cfa> no

[00:43] <cfa> "I mean the spacing is weird" was what raiph said

[00:43] <[Coke]> cfa; yes, well, I'm frustrated to have to say "please submit a screen shot" multiple times.

[00:44] <cfa> okay

[00:44] <[Coke]> If that's the ticket we have, we'll fix the spacing eventually, for sure.

[00:44] <raiph> coke: it doesn't look "fine" to me in an ideal sense

[00:44] <[Coke]> but for now, the ticket as reported is not urgent.

[00:44] <cfa> it looks worse than the original doc site, and doesn't represent what's in the underlying code example

[00:44] <cfa> i don't know why this isn't considered urgent or important but there you go

[00:44] <raiph> but it's not important or urgent in my view

[00:44] <cfa> fair enough

[00:45] <[Coke]> Are you saying that lines of code in raku/doc source are not in the rendered sample?

[00:45] <cfa> no

[00:45] <[Coke]> then what do you mean by "doesn't represent" ?

[00:45] <cfa> i'm saying that if the source looks like this: 'x y' then it may be rendered like this: 'x         y'

[00:45] <[Coke]> an annotated screen grab would definitely help me understand what you're talking about.

[00:45] <cfa> which is what's happening in multiple places on the regex page

[00:46] <cfa> yeah okay i'll find somewhere to upload later on today

[00:46] <[Coke]> Thank you. That was not clear from your previous complaint.

[00:46] <cfa> when the original doc site was up the comparison was obvious from the urls

[00:46] <cfa> complaint?

[00:47] <[Coke]> "bug"

[00:48] <cfa> okay

[00:48] <raiph> i've got a png, where do i share it?

[00:48] <[Coke]> a screen grab or a more detailed explanation would have been very helpful. I saw "padding", and yes, there's definitely more padding *around* the examples. highlighting the actual text of the problem, now I hopefully see what you're pointing out

[00:50] <[Coke]> raiph++

[00:51] <[Coke]> Definitely, that's worse than what I thought the original bug was saying, and what I saw just now looking at the page.

[00:53] <cfa> i provided an example of the underlying html and the exact css that was causing the problem

[00:53] <cfa> the screenshot is very helpful, i agree

[00:53] <cfa> anyway, as a user i find this rendering issue significant 

[00:55] <raiph> Imo it looks awful but I am confident it's of little concern.

[00:55] <cfa> :)

[00:56] <raiph> Everyone will hate it.

[00:56] <raiph> So everyone will want it fixed.

[00:56] <raiph> So coke doesn't have to worry about it. :)

[00:57] <raiph> Most of the links to the doc from StackOverflow being broken?

[00:57] <[Coke]> yes, we know, coleman is working on it now

[00:57] <raiph> That's still not overly concerning.

[00:58] <raiph> Because everyone will hate it and focus on it too. :)

[00:58] <[Coke]> ? I think that does make it concerning.

[00:58] <raiph> Coke: and as you said, you don't think it'll be too challenging.

[00:58] <[Coke]> ... which is why we're working on it.

[00:58] <[Coke]> raiph: ah

[00:59] <raiph> Coke: Yeah, I worry about the stuff that is difficult.

[00:59] <raiph> Like people getting on with each other.

[00:59] <[Coke]> cfa: so, yes, that seems more than just cosmetic, hopefully someone can fix it in the next few days

[00:59] <raiph> And getting past the point the doc is essentially frozen.

[01:00] <cfa> [Coke]: thanks

[01:00] <coleman> you just gotta rip the bandaid off

[01:00] <raiph> Coke: yes, these are things you, cfa, coleman, richard, altai-main, ... have guided us through.

[01:00] <cfa> apologies for being crotchety

[01:00] <raiph> now *that* is important

[01:01] <[Coke]> cfa: same

[01:01] <[Coke]> In my defense, I *am* old. :)

[01:01] <raiph> :)

[01:03] <cfa> and in my defense, i'm cantankerous

[01:03] <cfa> no wait

[01:03] <[Coke]> ^_^

[01:04] <[Coke]> it's been a hot minute since I've done front end web UI, but I suspect we need to take the new style sheet that includes .section and carve out an exception for anything under <span class="source raku">

[01:06] <cfa> yeah

[01:06] <cfa> it's possible that other classes are affecting code blocks -- this is just the one i happened to notice while browsing the regex page

[11:12] <lizmat> I like the new doc site, but I have one beef with it

[11:13] <lizmat> I sorta expected that opening the table of contents on a page, would reflow the page instead of hiding the left part of the page

[11:13] <lizmat> if it *is* supposed to do that, then it doesn't do that on Safari

[13:18] <Voldenet> I've noticed there's alternate stylesheets on the docs page now, but they can't be switched on firefox with theme switcher

[13:19] <lizmat> Voldenet: there's now also a repo for the website, perhaps a PR would be easy to make? https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/

[13:21] <Voldenet> now I see there's multiple css files for every theme, I'm not sure if stylesheets with the same title are grouped or not

[14:21] <[Coke]> ok, team, I can press a button to do a production release to fix the .html issue... but I have never done this before and might break it. My take is I should wait for coleman to press this button so I don't take the site down. Thoughts?

[14:22] <[Coke]> (I legitimately have a concern that it's asking for env vars but I don't know if anything is required there)

[17:25] <coleman> Hey Coke, you sunk my battleship! https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/pull/154

[17:26] <[Coke]> yah, sorry

[17:26] <coleman> If you're hacking on the Caddyfile later, you can remove that "named matcher" directive (the one with the @)

[17:26] <coleman> it's nbd. just cleanup.

[17:27] <[Coke]> I thought about that but fixing prod bug outweighed config file cleanup, I thought

[17:27] <coleman> I don't think Caddy cares about tabs/spaces fwiw

[17:27] <[Coke]> the docker trick worked a charm, even on mac m2.

[17:27] <[Coke]> coleman++

[17:27] <coleman> np. I wanted to mention it here because having dead code is confusing. especially since it's probably a new server for most.

[17:28] <coleman> I'll convert the Buildah script to a Dockerfile soon.

[17:28] <coleman> the command is

[17:28] <coleman> `buildah bud Dockerfile`

[17:29] * [Coke] needs to write all these things down so he doesn't ask coleman all the same questions again next week

[17:48] <[Coke]> coleman: or in the wiki.

[17:48] <[Coke]> coleman: is there a way to monitor if docs-dev has updated?

[17:49] <[Coke]> (and which commit id it's using, so I can verify if the next update includes your change to the Caddy file as well)

[17:54] <[Coke]> https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website looks like "we build the site", but not "we deployed it to docs-dev"

[17:54] <[Coke]> ah, maybe it's hourly, and we're about 10m out.

[17:59] <coleman> I think perhaps the build script can drop a comment in index.html or the git sha, or something like that

[18:05] <[Coke]> there's a bug for that:

[18:06] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/145 - you're right, that'd cover my ask

[18:06] <[Coke]> https://docs-dev.raku.org/type/Proc::Async works again

[18:07] <[Coke]> going to deploy to prod.

[18:08] <[Coke]> ... once the hourly build finishes?

[18:09] <[Coke]> I am confused why docs-dev has my fix, which isn't content.

[18:11] <cfa> morning

[18:12] <coleman> The hourly build includes everything that was added to Raku/doc

[18:12] <coleman> because the build script under bin_files does a fetch of the latest Raku/doc

[18:13] <coleman> Which is hard to see of course becuase of this https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/bin_files/build-site

[18:14] <coleman> Speaking personally, I'd like more comments all over this code to help me follow the thread :)

[18:20] <Voldenet> I did the thing – it's not the code I'm proud of, but it works

[18:20] <Voldenet> I'm not sure what browsers are going to be supported, so no fancy js syntax

[18:22] <[Coke]> We don't have an official list of supported browsers atm.

[18:23] <[Coke]> cfa: good to see you

[18:23] <[Coke]> pushing to prod...

[18:24] <[Coke]> wow, that's fast

[18:24] <cfa> neat

[18:24] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/type/Proc::Async works again

[18:24] <cfa> 👍

[18:29] <coleman> thanks coke

[19:21] <Voldenet> re themes: I wonder if it's a good idea to let colorschemed-versions be defined by plugins

[19:21] <Voldenet> >  typegraph-dark.css typegraph-light.css>,

[19:23] <Voldenet> Not that anyone would add more themes to docs

[19:25] <coleman> Coke, note that the prod deploy is a fire-and-forget trigger that instructs code running on prod to pull the latest container

[19:25] <coleman> so it is feasible that (at the moment) a green pipeline run masks a failure to pull the container

[19:26] <coleman> Unlikely, since the system has few moving parts and is simple. But be aware.
