[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: fix issue #193

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - Headings in Composite files were being added to Search data, but composite files are themselves created from Primary headings, so headings in composite files are redundant.

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - This patch filters them out of search data.

[19:52] <[Coke]> lizmat: in that branch, seeing a lot of failures where the pod from a test file doesn't match between ast and current. will try to sum up the changes.

[19:53] <lizmat> [Coke]: please, I probably won't have time to look at this until Wednesday, though  :-(

[19:53] <[Coke]> zero rush

[19:54] <[Coke]> I think I'm going to have to convert all the tests to use RAKUAST for extracting pod for testing to clean them up, make them faster, and avoid it trying to think actual code is meant to be tested.

[19:54] <[Coke]> I really just wanted the POD bits in the xt/ files to be spell checked, etc.

[19:55] <[Coke]> (all started because I saw we had used "environmental variables" somewhere in xt or util

[19:55] <[Coke]> afk
