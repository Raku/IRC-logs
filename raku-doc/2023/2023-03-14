[03:47] <Voldenet> the problem of users not knowing all the features in the language and reimplementing them isn't raku-specific

[03:49] <Voldenet> the only exception is when language is really small, but that's not useful at all

[03:51] <Voldenet> for instance python has topological sort in it, but I bet everyone ends up reimplementing it when necessary

[03:57] <Voldenet> what would be nice would be listing routines, classes and operators by use frequency somehow

[12:08] <Nemokosch> Voldenet: I did reimplement topological sort and was about to facepalm - then I noticed this only came with Python 3.9

[12:08] <Nemokosch> which was released literally around the days I needed to do it :D anyway, couldn't aim any higher than Python 3.5
