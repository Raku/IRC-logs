[15:19] <[Coke]> is that something we could consider using in Raku/rakudoc ?

[19:01] <[Coke]> coleman: any blockers on the devops side of things?

[19:03] <lizmat> [Coke]: yes, I think all rakudoc renderers should / will start using the RakuAST tree, rather than what has been mangled into $=pod

[19:36] <[Coke]> ok, let's start with the tests in raku/doc/xt and go from there. I'll poke at that this evening.

[19:38] <lizmat> note that the RakuDoc::To::Text renderer is *not* compatible with Pod::To::Text

[19:38] <lizmat> it does way more (such as creating an index of links)

[19:39] <[Coke]> need HEAD rakudo for this, yes?

[19:43] <lizmat> yes

[19:48] <[Coke]> no way to officially declare that, right? Ah, maybe declare dependency on the module?
