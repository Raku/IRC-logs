[20:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/a462f3c23b

[20:23] <[Coke]> switching over to use AST to do pod-to-text, getting Cannot find method 'from-paragraphs' on object of type NQPMu

[20:24] <[Coke]> I don't invoke this method anywhere.

[20:24] <[Coke]> guessing it's from the .paragraphs call

[20:27] <[Coke]> ... maybe missing the RAKUAST env var at run time?

[20:28] <[Coke]> lizmat: rakuast table processing dying here:

[20:29] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/doc/Language/101-basics.rakudoc#L237

[20:29] <[Coke]> ===SORRY!===

[20:29] <[Coke]> Table has a mixture of visible and invisible column-separator types

[20:29] <[Coke]> in line '$line       'Ana Dave \| 3:0''

[20:38] <[Coke]> also https://dev.to/lizmat/walking-the-rakuast-tree-3fbd's last code block has an extra trailing ) I think

[20:42] <[Coke]> also, it is grepping for type==data, but am getting a type=pod ?

[20:45] <[Coke]> looks like a bit of work to get it to match original --doc output.

[20:45] <[Coke]> I will consider this a head start.

[20:45] <[Coke]> (on my part for converting raku/doc to use this for testing)

[20:47] <[Coke]> running AST's --doc is much closer, but still several WS diffs.

[22:02] <lizmat> [Coke]: fix blog post, thanks

[22:03] <lizmat> you need to specify RAKUDO_RAKUAST=1 to run pod-to-text...  bootstrapping issue...  :-)

[22:04] <lizmat> will look at rest tomorrow
