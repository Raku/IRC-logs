[13:52] <[Coke]> 32 tickets left for end of March. 14 are checklists, 4 are Kaiepi's PRs that hopefully require very little work.

[13:54] <[Coke]> m: say "{(32 / (Date(2023,3,31)-Date.today))} tickets/day";

[13:54] <[Coke]> 2. it's 2 (and there's a typo in that line.)

[14:00] <[Coke]> and I just closed 2 that apparently lizmat had already completed. :)

[14:09] <[Coke]> cfa: any outstanding issues on the links PR?

[14:10] <[Coke]> I addressed at least some of the concerns you had.

[14:13] <[Coke]> and regarding the testing of doc-website templates - I think the way I did it makes more sense because you have dependencies to run the tests that you would have already had to satisfy on raku/doc - if you instead pull the tests into doc-website via the clone of raku/doc, you may then not be able to run them unless you install the deps (and the tests may require work to deal with being run out of a 

[14:13] <[Coke]> different relative directory)

[17:01] <cfa> [Coke]: links pr looks good from a preliminary run this morning

[17:01] <cfa> lots of failures, though it's possible to address these with some automated rewrites 

[17:02] <cfa> as for the content tests, i suppose that makes sense. with this in place, though, we'd have each repo cloning the other, which seems messy and coupled.

[17:03] <cfa> i understand that you don't want to duplicate the tests themselves though

[17:07] <cfa> back to the links test: i wonder whether the test itself should skip over 'raku', 'perl' and other tokens that are likely to be false positives.  it might also be worthwhile to add a negative look ahead for 'method' so that 'Str method' isn't treated as if it should link to /type/Str

[17:08] <[Coke]> all good points.

[17:10] <cfa> i guess i'm not sure whether it makes sense to merge that links test before addressing most of the failures

[17:11] <cfa> or whether to maintain it in draft, address most of them, then commit

[17:11] <cfa> btw, you've got a rewrite in the pr -- not sure whether that's accidental

[17:12] <[Coke]> a rewrite?

[17:13] <[Coke]> If you mean force push, yes, probably

[17:13] <cfa> no, a tweak to the documentation to satisfy the test

[17:13] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4256/files#diff-f47dc6af260558e0412381694a15bf28bfe20109763f8adb775219081703aff3

[17:16] <[Coke]> Figured the end result of this branch is one commit to add the test, one commit to make it pass.

[17:17] <cfa> one commit to make it pass might make sense, though it'll touch a lot of files

[17:17] <[Coke]> we could back that out and just have the test, I know you had another branch with fixes.

[17:17] <cfa> here: Failed 118/416 subtests

[17:17] <[Coke]> well, N commits.

[17:17] <cfa> (but some of those rewrites are likely incorrect)

[17:18] <cfa>  188 files changed, 2678 insertions(+), 2678 deletions(-)

[17:20] <cfa> some of those failures are C<Raku> etc.

[17:20] <cfa> and some are rewrites that i missed with these simple patterns

[17:20] * cfa reruns the test in the type-links branch 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: b7ab3cd77d | (Will Coleda)++ | doc/Type/Bool.rakudoc

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: Revert "clean up test descriptions"

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: This reverts commit a8963e1d620075b044ffcfd482adda5827af3a05.

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: 

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: only for doc/Type/Bool.rakudoc

[17:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/b7ab3cd77d

[17:24] <[Coke]> there, now we're back to just the test

[17:26] <cfa> Failed 237/416 subtests

[17:26] <cfa> oh, that's before you did the above

[17:26] <cfa> so those rewrites address approx. 119 failures

[17:34] <cfa> as for the #index-entry stuff: if the tooling can re-create those older targets, great; if not, i'd suggest we merge this or something similar in the near future.  as it stands, a lot of cross-references are broken, which leads to a frustrating user experience 

[17:35] <cfa> (and if the targets can be regenerated but not in the near future, it might be worth merging something like this then rolling back once generation is fixed)

[17:36] <cfa> i defer to you on that

[17:39] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: e52b6c87e5 | (Will Coleda)++ | xt/rakudoc-types.rakutest

[17:39] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: Don't complain about perl or raku

[17:39] <Geth> ¦ doc/type-links: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/e52b6c87e5

[17:41] <[Coke]> let's get it working in place, keeping old links working if possible

[17:42] <[Coke]> ah, see your q to fin. let's see ehat he says

[17:42] <[Coke]> perl/raku shaves a few failures, not many

[17:43] <cfa> agreed re: old links

[17:43] <[Coke]> if the link is something like C<Str> method - This should prob be L<Str method|...>

[17:44] <[Coke]> and so we should complain, but the fix may be not the simple one the test recommends.

[17:46] <cfa> i suppose so

[17:48] <cfa> oh, missed some rewrites

[17:48] <cfa> 114 failures here but i'll rerun the test in a few

[17:54] <[Coke]> We should add the main suggestion to the styleguide, also, and any others like for methods.

[17:54] <[Coke]> Checking the text after the link will be harder.

[17:55] <[Coke]> since we're walking the pod structure, and would have to save state... Guessing it's not worth figuring out the coding if we're already down to 114 total.

[17:55] <[Coke]> would be nifty, though.

[17:56] <cfa> hopefully <114

[17:56] <cfa> but i'm not sure how many of these are incorrect rewrites

[17:56] <cfa> the changes that i've spotchecked have been correct

[18:00] <cfa> okay, Failed 65/416 subtests

[18:01] <[Coke]> that's 65 files, not 65 instances, yes?

[18:01] <cfa> # You failed 65 tests of 416

[18:01] <cfa> this is the output of prove

[18:02] <cfa> so in doc/Type/independent-routines.rakudoc,     # You failed 6 tests of 70

[18:02] <cfa> looks like there're very few files that are failing

[18:05] <cfa> oh, no, you're right: 65 files

[18:15] <[Coke]> yah, doing each file as a collection of subtests is much easier to write, but harder to count.

[18:16] <[Coke]> 1/6 is pretty good considering we started with failing so much

[18:23] <cfa> [Coke]: take a look at https://github.com/cfa/raku-doc/tree/normalise-type-links

[18:23] <cfa> i haven't tried rendering this yet

[18:23] <cfa> but you can see the rewrites there

[18:23] <cfa> and test them locally

[18:24] <cfa> (239 changed files with 2,772 additions and 2,772 deletions)

[18:25] <cfa> this is a child of your type-links branch btw

[18:29] <[Coke]> nice.
