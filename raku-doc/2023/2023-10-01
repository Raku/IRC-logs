[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: This commit splits the discussion of Raku's built-in regexes into two

[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: sections: one discussing the anchors/zero-width assertions and one

[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: discussing the two built-in tokens (<ws> and <ident>).  Hopefully this

[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: will help clarify the ratcheting behavior of <ws>

[22:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: * Refactor search function

[22:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: This addresses multiple issues, nearly all of those tagged `SEARCH`. The PR:

[22:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - introduces a new plugin called `options-search`, which replaces `search-bar` almost seemlessly

[22:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - modifies plugin `page-styling` to remove the right-hand tile. This was hidden before. The tile was introduced to provide a frame for the search results to be presented. The approach was not liked, so there is no need to have the HTML for it.

[22:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: - The options-search search bar contains an icon to the right with an (i) and a tooltip saying search options
