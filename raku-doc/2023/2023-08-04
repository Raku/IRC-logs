[14:00] <NemokoschKiwi> um, hello, regarding the docs... if there were a rework of the operators part of the documentation, are there any particular wishes you would have about it?

[14:15] <[Coke]> I'd review the open tickets to make sure you're covering any existing issues, and if it's a big change, I'd write it up as a ticket with the points you're planning to cover so you can get feedback.

[14:15] <[Coke]> (or discussion instead of issue if you think that's appropriate)

[14:36] <NemokoschKiwi> yep, this may be a discussion-worthy topic...

[14:38] <NemokoschKiwi> the gazillion of mobile issues really challenge my sanity... it's not only thankless unpleasant work for anyone possibly interested in the site

[14:39] <NemokoschKiwi> but like duh, who on earth decided that <7" screens are now suited for programming or even learning programming

[14:40] <NemokoschKiwi> also, maybe I was born old but I thought "pinch to zoom" was meant to be a feature and phones around 2010 used to be much smaller
