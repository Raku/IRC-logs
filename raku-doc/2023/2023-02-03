[15:34] <[Coke]> added new label for raku/doc tickets called "doc-website" which means that someone should figure out the core complaint on that ticket (which we think is still a thing) and open a corresponding ticket on the new doc-website

[15:36] <[Coke]> Planning on going through all the tickets labeled search, site, and assigned to Altai-man and closing them as appropriate or moving them to doc-website, or tagging that they need to be moved.
