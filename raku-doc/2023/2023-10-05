[02:06] <[Coke]> ab5tract: hi - did I miss a send before that last one?

[02:43] <[Coke]> no I did not. ab5tract , just opened https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/186

[02:52] <[Coke]> coleman: https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/issues/50 something you have opinions on?

[03:18] <coleman> sometimes a little git surgery is needed. I will check out the recommended commands tomorrow. 

[03:18] <coleman> looks pretty safe at first glance

[03:21] <[Coke]> lizmat: coleman isnot a member of the raku team under permissions

[03:22] <[Coke]> I think the "force push" was the scary part, but this is a low risk repo

[03:24] <coleman> it's indeed a history rewrite. we can take a backup first.

[03:25] <coleman> I sleep now ðŸ˜ª

[03:28] <[Coke]> zzz

[03:28] <[Coke]> did a logt of ticket cleanup on raku.org, self assigned a ton.

[11:36] <Geth> Â¦ doc-website/remove_redundant_headings_from_search: - Headings in Composite files were being added to Search data, but composite files are themselves created from Primary headings, so headings in composite files are redundant.

[12:03] <NemokoschKiwi> Re raku.org, I suspect the site updater script has faulty logic and it simply goes unnoticed because it does the safe thing often enough...

[12:03] <NemokoschKiwi> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/blob/0919a36d1e8421c1fb3f31badf0f6671900c369b/update.sh#L18

[12:03] <[Coke]> there's an open bug about the update.sh script, FYI

[12:03] <NemokoschKiwi> to me this reads like, "if the includes folder has been changed"

[12:04] <NemokoschKiwi> and mowyw --make will *avoid* full regeneration of content

[12:04] <NemokoschKiwi> so it says "if the includes folder has been changed, DON'T regenerate all the files, if it hasn't, then DO regenerate all of them"

[12:05] <NemokoschKiwi> which means in theory, if somebody modified an included template, the content would be wrong until the next commit that doesn't modify any included templates

[12:06] <NemokoschKiwi> (and also that there is a lot of unintended regeneration going on, I guess)

[12:08] <NemokoschKiwi> for the features part... not one hundred percent sure but I think we might have even eliminated the features part

[12:09] <NemokoschKiwi> it's still hosted but the repository fetched has been archived 3 years ago

[12:10] <NemokoschKiwi> https://raku.org/compilers/features.html look at the header

[12:11] <NemokoschKiwi> the current header is not even this anymore

[12:12] <NemokoschKiwi> Actually, even "Design" was removed from the navbar
