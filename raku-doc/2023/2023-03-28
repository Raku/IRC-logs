[14:23] <[Coke]> finanalyst's PR for Language vs. language had me go back to the test; it wouldn't have caught it because it was "Language", not "/Language", but also: there was no link, only content.  L<some/path> looks like it renders as a link with the same link/display, but internally, the link is null and the content is the only thing set.

[14:31] <[Coke]> We might want to say that if there's no protocol, links have to start with /

[15:44] <Xliff> Who is leading development for the docs site?

[15:48] <[Coke]> There's a few people working on it, mainly someone who doesn't IRC.

[15:48] <[Coke]> What's up?

[15:55] <[Coke]> I'm kind of the product owner, fwiw.

[19:07] <Xliff> [Coke] - Thanks for responding. I was wondering why each page did not have the sidebar for ease of navigation, but I see t hat it does in newer versions.

[19:08] <Xliff> Hoping those make it to docs.raku.org soon.

[19:23] <[Coke]> Every page does have the sidebar.

[19:23] <[Coke]> Are you looking at docs-dev vs. docs?

[19:24] <[Coke]> *most* pages. (it's hidden behind the blue |>| in the upper left hand side)

[19:26] <[Coke]> (the home page itself doesn't have it)
