[15:29] <Util> The next monthly status call would be 31 minutes from now,

[15:29] <Util> although we did not update https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki to declare the date&time.

[15:29] <Util> I will be on the call for about 1/2 hour, hoping to discuss my (not-yet-public) work

[15:29] <Util> on allowing live running of code samples in the docs.

[22:37] <Util> NemokoschKiwi: No, at least not in the first 30 minutes (after which I had to depart). 

[22:37] <Util> I am travelling overseas during the next meeting, so cannot attend.

[22:39] <Util> I will outline the progress (and hurtles) toward runnable examples with you and the rest of the Raku Study Group tomorrow, then try to write something up for everyone else.
