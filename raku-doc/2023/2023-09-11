[15:47] <coleman> That container has both content and code from the main branches baked in

[15:49] <coleman> The content is built and mounted like so https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/.buildkite/container.sh#L4

[18:41] <[Coke]> Util: You still here?

[18:42] <[Coke]> Util: so depending on your OS, maybe you can follow the normal instructions already on the site - I couldn't (on a mac), so I needed that container, and with coleman's latest URL here, sounds like we could build our own with which branch, etc. and run that anywhere w/ docker.
