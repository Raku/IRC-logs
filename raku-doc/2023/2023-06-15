[17:57] <coleman> The dependencies for this highlighter thing are a nightmare

[17:58] <coleman> I don't like reaching into personal repos for this core stuff

[18:03] <[Coke]> I think our goal is to replace the atom highlighter with RakuAST at some point.

[18:12] <[Coke]> Raku and Perl have many "big" modules that are owned by individuals and the not the community, so I wouldn't in general be worried about that.

[18:12] <[Coke]> ... depending on the module, and the individual, and how often it's been updated, etc.

[18:14] <coleman> Okay, well, as an architectual point, it's a problem

[18:15] <coleman> This is a problem:

[18:15] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/bin_files/build-site

[18:16] <coleman> I shouldn't need to chase that stuff; it should take params, etc.

[18:17] <coleman> I'm going to take some time to re-learn how this works this afternoon

[18:18] <coleman> Oh [Coke] can you try something for me

[18:19] <[Coke]> yes?

[18:19] <coleman> actually nvm

[18:20] <[Coke]> ok

[18:20] <coleman> I was goieng to ask for you to connect buildkite to github, but i think I can do that

[20:30] <coleman> Temporarily reducing the number of build agents

[20:30] <[Coke]> okD

[20:30] <coleman> I am testing my changes to the base image

[20:36] <coleman> I think that assertion is invalid, but it's hard to tell. atom-perl-highlighter might be the name of a directory

[20:36] <coleman> and only that

[20:42] <[Coke]> tag richard and make him fix it?

[20:43] <coleman> it was my misunderstanding. The issue I opened on his repo would be the most helpful

[20:44] <coleman> Give the caller more power somehow. Maybe it's a config option I don't know about.

[20:50] <[Coke]> +1

[23:45] <coleman> Scaling CI agents back out.

[23:53] <coleman> Triggered multiple builds to "warm" the agents. An initial build can take 20 minutes.
