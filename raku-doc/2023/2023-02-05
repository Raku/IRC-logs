[23:19] <rf> Hmm, how does the search bar actually work, there are no network calls?

[23:42] <[Coke]> https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/assets/scripts/search-bar.js

[23:43] <[Coke]> All the data needed for search is there, generated at build time. if we ever do have a dynamic site, I expect this will change to a call

[23:58] <rf> Ah I see, thanks.
