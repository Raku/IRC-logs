[19:36] <coleman> Working on the docs-dev website updating issue. Disk space issue, naturally.

[20:01] <coleman> I think we're good

[20:02] <coleman> https://docs-dev.raku.org/about shows a recent timestamp for the image generation

[20:23] <coleman> To confirm: the next docs coordinating meeting is Saturday, May 20 (?)

[20:25] <lizmat> I think that's correct

[20:25] <lizmat> that'd be the 3rd Saturday, no?

[20:26] <lizmat> [00:00:31]  <[Coke]>	Next weekend is my kid's College Graduation. will bump meeting out one week so it's the third saturday

[20:26] <coleman> Correct
