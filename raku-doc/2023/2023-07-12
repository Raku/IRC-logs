[15:14] <[Coke]> thoughts on https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc/issues/27 ?

[15:41] <coleman> Not sure I agree with optimistically searching again

[16:05] <[Coke]> I have been bitten on zef because I mis-cased something.

[16:06] <[Coke]> What about having a -i option to allow the search to hit in the first place?

[16:06] <coleman> That is the approach I like

[16:07] <coleman> If you want something even fuzzier... add a --fuzzy :)

[16:08] <coleman> [Coke] do you use Ripgrep? I like their flags. The use -i like that.

[16:08] <[Coke]> is that another grep replacement? I use ack/rak for that usually

[16:09] <coleman> It is; here they are https://envs.sh/zq

[16:10] * [Coke] was just reading their github readme. nifty
