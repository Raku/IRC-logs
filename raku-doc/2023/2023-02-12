[17:33] <[Coke]> So, it sounded like the call happened - wasn't locked because I wasn't there, right? Again, apologies.

[17:35] <lizmat> yeah, the call happened...

[17:35] <lizmat> I attended for the first 10 mins or so, but then had to leave

[17:35] <lizmat> because of a previous engagement

[17:39] <[Coke]> Thank you!
