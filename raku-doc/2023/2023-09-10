[00:43] <[Coke]> Util: ... I am not really pushing these calls, and I think everyone has realized how bad I am about it.

[00:43] <[Coke]> apologies.

[00:44] <[Coke]> I owe everyone a round.

[00:45] <[Coke]> for work, I do a thing where if there's no agenda, we skip the call. I suspect a similar thing will work here, and in future, if you had that agenda item, it wuold have triggered the call.

[00:45] <[Coke]> Util: pick a weekend time that works for you and let me know and that'll be the next one

[00:46] <[Coke]> also can we get a bot in here that yells at me about the meeting?

[00:48] <[Coke]> also: what's the raku study group?

[00:49] <[Coke]> oh, i thought was also today!

[00:49] <[Coke]> ok, I will try to attend that!

[14:54] <Util>  Coke: (and anyone in-channel) Study Group announcement:

[14:54] <Util> Today   : https://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg11009.html

[14:54] <Util> Overall : https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/14ytt23/the_raku_study_group/

[14:56] <Util> Starts 2:30 Central, lasts 3-4 hours. Casual unannounced drop-in attendance is fine at any time in that window!

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: rewrite deprecated-urls to working alternatives

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: 

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: - The README.rakudoc is amended and converted to .md describing where deprecated urls are stored

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: - The Caddyfile is changed so that the mapping in `plugins/raku-doc-setup/deprecated-urls` are incorporated when the fileserver gets a deprecated url

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: - The cro-app plugin is amended so that if doc-website is run locally by a developer, it will do the remapping done by Caddy

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: - The plugin `plugins/raku-doc-setup` is amended so that it transfers `deprecated-urls` to the `rendered_html/assets` directory. This approach is chosen so that if `rendered_assets/` is changed in the config, deprecated-urls will still be correctly transfered.

[19:29] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/redistribute_content_new_navigation: - The config file `02-plugins` is altered to call `raku-doc-setup` at the transfer milestone

[19:45] <[Coke]> util: so this isn't the study group that is happening at 1pm pacific time?

[19:46] <[Coke]> (there are two raku study groups on the same day!?)

[19:47] <[Coke]> ... ok, no it *is* 1pm pacific (so why 2:30 central!?)

[19:49] <[Coke]> ... ok, meeting has not started yet, so guessing it's 3pm central.

[19:53] <[Coke]> also confusingly, the link on meeting was for friday!?

[20:18] <Util> Yes, 3PM Central. I think someone misakenly dragged the item in my Google schedule by a half-hour.

[20:26] <[Coke]> whoopsie

[22:11] <[Coke]> Util: OK, I lied, I am not going to check these in, because they point to our devops person's personal container.

[22:11] <[Coke]> in the cloud, this is the stuff: read https://github.com/Raku/infra/blob/main/config/doc-website/overview.md

[22:12] <[Coke]> Locally, if I want to run with a check of the caddy file, I have:

[22:12] <[Coke]> docker run -v $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile -p8080:80 quay.io/colemanx/raku-doc-website

[22:12] <[Coke]> But you can do that without the file mapping to get the default.

[22:12] <[Coke]> I *think* that is running with the local info of the doc site. if it's not, we'll need updated instructions from richard & coleman.
