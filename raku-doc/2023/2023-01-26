[18:33] <[Coke]> Glad to see all the work going into the current iteration.

[18:35] <[Coke]> There are two open tickets left for "Go Live"

[18:35] <[Coke]> (one of which is for devops to decide how they want to approach it)

[18:36] <[Coke]> coleman: what's left from the infra side?

[20:12] <coleman> Containerization, then a way to make this happen: https://github.com/Raku/infra/issues/8

[20:15] <coleman> I am meeting w/ Fin Saturday morning and I'll try to get containerization done then

[20:15] <coleman> I don't think cutover will happen this weekend, but maybe a pre-release dev version could get deployed

[20:45] <[Coke]> that would be awesome.
