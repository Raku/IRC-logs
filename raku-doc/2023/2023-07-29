[18:07] <tbrowder__> howdy, i'm working on a doc PR and wonder if this is an acceptable X<> reference (on next line):

[18:08] <tbrowder__> =head1 X<Language, Whitespace> Whitespace...

[18:38] <lizmat> tbrowder__: are you trying to cross reference "Language, Whitespace" but have nowhere to link it to yet, then yes I think it's valid

[18:47] <tbrowder__> yes, i tried to find it by search but not much luck. then i searched all the raw src docs and not much referencing showed up.

[18:48] <tbrowder__> i vaguely remember the last time i worked on docs there was an accpt

[18:49] <tbrowder__> acceptable but rigidly defined sequence

[18:49] <tbrowder__> *at least for the first entry, not sure about the second

[18:50] <tbrowder__> anyhoo, working on a PR and plan to use that ref if no objection

[19:59] <[Coke]> oops, should have pushed sooner, now have a conflict in my test cleanup

[20:00] <[Coke]> make sure 'TEST_FILES=<files you changed> make xtest" is clean on the PR

[20:00] <[Coke]> I believe that covers the valid X links.

[20:03] <[Coke]> xt/search-categories.rakutest

[20:04] <[Coke]> ah, run that one without any subtests.

[20:04] <[Coke]> er, without specifying test_files
