[02:01] <coleman> Is the "About" link not clickable for anyone else? I'm talking about the header

[02:01] <coleman> https://docs.raku.org

[02:02] <coleman> feels javascripty

[03:38] <rf> I can click it

[13:21] <[Coke]> I can click it, seems like a regular <a>

[13:50] *** lucs joined
[13:51] <lucs> Oooh, the channel is logged. Yay!

[13:51] <lucs> Er, not sure where though...

[13:51] <lucs> Oh, got it (says on the website).,

[13:52] *** rf joined
[13:57] <lucs> Just opened recent doc logs for fun and would like to mention this:

[13:59] <lucs> @coleman: The "About" link won't click for me either (as won't "Report an issue…", but I have a workaround:

[14:00] <lucs> Click on the word "More", then press arrow-down once (or twice) and Enter.

[14:01] <lucs> Er, actually twice (or four times).

[14:07] <[Coke]> Please report an issue for that, and be sure to include browser info/version (clicking on those links works here and they look like <a> tags, so not sure what's going wrong there for you)

[14:07] <lucs> Okay.

[14:08] <[Coke]> also maybe include viewport size.

[14:09] <[Coke]> (maybe the css is causing something to hover over the <a>_)

[14:13] <[Coke]> Thanks for the report, either way

[16:21] <coleman> I've opened issue 226 in doc-website to track the About link issue. Interestingly, the link works fine if I narrow my browser window's width.

[16:21] <coleman> See screenshots there for more info.

[16:22] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/226

[16:33] <lucs> coleman: Cf. https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/225 :-)

[16:33] <lucs> We appear to agree :)

[16:33] <coleman> ack!

[16:33] <coleman> Mine's better. Mine has SCREENSHOTs

[16:34] <coleman> yours has the nod from [Coke], though

[16:34] <coleman> ...perhaps we're even...this time

[16:34] <lucs> I'm not a big fan of screenshots, but hey, twice reported, maybe it'll get twice the action!

[16:35] <coleman> I'm going to close yours in favor of the one with screenshots. Please don't take it as a slight. :)

[16:35] <lucs> Hmm...

[16:36] <[Coke]> (screenshots) annoying to provide but definitely helps.

[16:36] <lucs> I can't copy/paste screenshots in my notes, that's why I avoid them as much as possible.

[16:37] <coleman> I'm adding your browser environment to my issue

[16:37] <lucs> And describing problems in words is excellent writing practice (for me anyway).

[16:38] <coleman> lucs what OS do you use?

[16:38] <coleman> or rather what OS was this bug detected on

[16:38] <lucs> Linux, Slackware 14.2

[16:39] <[Coke]> coleman: we can close tickets as dupes rather than completed, but we're not doing any kind of tracking on that

[16:40] <lucs> I'm not offended, but mine wasn't a "dupe", it was an "antecedent" :)

[16:41] <coleman> okay, back to day job

[16:41] <coleman> ttyl

[16:41] <lucs> Have fun!

[16:41] <coleman> weeeee

[16:45] <lucs> Okay, who wants to do one with screenshots about: when a page has a '▸' openable menu on the left, after opening and selecting an item, it should automatically close.

[16:47] <lucs> Another one: "Enter to select" doesn't always.

[16:48] <[Coke]> Just saw a ticket about that one

[16:48] <lucs> Oh, I searched for one, must have missed it.

[16:48] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/203#issuecomment-1481002944 - very old ticket, recent comment

[16:49] <lucs> Oh, it's a variant of that, right.

[16:53] <lucs> And that "Enter to select" text is both annoying (it wraps/unwraps lines in the dropdown as the mouse scrolls up and down) and sometimes wrong (when moving down the possible choices with a down arrow, the "Enter to select" doesn't follow and pressing "Enter" selects where the arrow is at, not where the "Enter to select" text is).

[16:53] <lucs> (wraps/unwraps when the browser window is narrow)

[16:55] <[Coke]> Yup. I think we are going to need a rewrite pass on search that addresses many of these issues holistically
