[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: Refactor search function

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: 

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: This addresses multiple issues, nearly all of those tagged `SEARCH`. The PR:

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: - introduces a new plugin called `options-search`, which replaces `search-bar` almost seemlessly

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: - modifies plugin `page-styling` to remove the right-hand tile. This was hidden before. The tile was introduced to provide a frame for the search results to be presented. The approach was not liked, so there is no need to have the HTML for it.

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: - The options-search search bar contains an icon to the right with an (i) and a tooltip saying search options

[00:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/replace_search: - Pressing on the i icon generates a modal frame with the various options available and the short cuts.
