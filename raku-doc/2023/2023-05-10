[09:22] * lizmat starts looking at handling =table doc

[09:22] <lizmat> what strikes me is that some of the formatting information is lost

[09:22] <lizmat> specifically what the column dividers are

[09:22] <lizmat> and where any row dividers where placed (and how)

[09:23] <lizmat> has this ever been an issue / request ?

[09:23] <lizmat> *were placed

[11:30] <lizmat> I've gathered my thoughts around supporting =table in RakuAST in https://gist.github.com/lizmat/02ac012fe1a32a5a26ba3be31d9d151b

[11:31] <lizmat> comments / suggestions etc welcome

[13:59] <Voldenet> I wish search was able to search for `Array.push` and get the https://docs.raku.org/type/Array.html#method_push as the result

[13:59] <Voldenet> not sure if it's necessary to have

[14:01] <lizmat> that feels like a useful feature though

[14:18] <[Coke]> Yes, that would be nice. please consider opening a feature request at doc-website

[14:38] <Voldenet> done

[14:40] <Voldenet> can't add labels, so here's the relevant issue https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/253
