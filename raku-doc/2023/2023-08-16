[01:19] <[Coke]> It's a reasonable ask, and you should start a discussion about it.

[17:59] <coleman> I can be there

[19:00] <coleman> [Coke] can you paste the link

[19:02] <lizmat> https://meet.jit.si/raku-docs

[19:02] *** finanalyst joined
[19:47] <coleman> Thank you, all

[19:48] <lizmat> :-)    afk&

[19:48] <NemokoschKiwi> let me ask it here as well: any info on the raku.org site's deployment?

[19:48] <NemokoschKiwi> trynna figure out who I could bother with the migration of those tools

[19:49] <coleman> If that is in a container as well I can stand up a similar system to docs site.

[19:50] <NemokoschKiwi> I don't know anything about it besides that there is a repo, so I just rolled with the assumption that those tools are used somewhere by someone

[19:52] <NemokoschKiwi> I wrote a little more on #raku-infra

[19:52] *** NemokoschKiwi left
[19:53] <coleman> I see it! I will respond

[19:58] <coleman> I have job interviews over the next 2 days. I will be mostly-unavailable, but @ me if there is an emergency

[20:04] <[Coke]> good luck!

[20:05] <[Coke]> crap. I seem to have lost my personal cell phone somewhere in the house.

[20:05] <[Coke]> Thanks everyone, was a good call
