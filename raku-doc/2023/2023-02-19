[16:36] <lizmat> I see that doc updates are sent to #raku as well as #raku-doc    maybe that should only be #raku-doc in the future ?

[16:39] <cfa> these seem like good candidates for rewriting as OUTPUT: «...»s

[16:48] <cfa> many false positives there but still -- maybe a few can be updated

[18:15] <coleman> I've started a new Hetzner project last night and I'm going to run the new site on servers that I'll pay for.

[18:15] <coleman> Then we'll gradually refactor off of rba's

[18:16] <coleman> (i think just rakubrew's website will be left)

[18:16] <coleman> I'll set up dev this afternoon.

[18:16] <coleman> I'll wait for Coke's word on cutting over for real; I'll just prepare the ground.

[18:17] <coleman> I wasn't aware that rba wanted to stop sponsoring until recently. Perhaps he mentioned it, though. 

[18:18] <coleman> Some of you will receive emails from Hetzner; That's probably from me. There's a way to allow other teammates limited access of various kinds.

[18:19] <coleman> Once things are settled down, we can talk budget, ownership, governance.

[18:21] <coleman> I'm learning Hetzner's interface. It's kind of nice. Not as many features as Linode or Digital Ocean (or AWS/Azure, of course), but some very interesting network stuff that those smaller clouds lack. Setting actual routes in a route table for one.

[18:43] <[Coke]> I feel bad about you paying for anything up front.

[18:44] <[Coke]> But I also didn't realize Roman was paying!

[18:44] <coleman> dont worry :)

[18:44] <[Coke]> let me check outstanding tickets.

[18:45] <coleman> prod not today

[18:46] <[Coke]> Right. For prod, 4 open tickets, and I don't think any of them are blockers.

[18:47] <[Coke]> My take on preserving all the URLS we've used: it's an ideal and we should strive to do it, but we've been so long without a content update (even longer for an automated one), that I'd rather get the new site in place and working. Not sure what everyone else's vote is on that particular issue.

[18:49] <coleman> agree

[18:50] <[Coke]> so, no real prod blockers (still nice to fix those if we can). What did you need my word for on dev?

[18:51] <coleman> no blockers from me. You've seen the container I'm deploying

[20:37] <coleman> Cloudflare HTTPS cert -> Hetzner LB -> Podman

[20:39] <coleman> The container should update itself every hour; As long as 1) the buildkite job doesn't fail and 2) the on-server cron job doesn't fail

[20:40] <coleman> I will write this up for the infra team

[20:42] <coleman> We can start thinking about the more advanced requirements like logs
