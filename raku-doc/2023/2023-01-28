[13:39] <NemokoschKiwi> do you all have no problems with the built-in search? (not the extended one)

[13:40] <NemokoschKiwi> I'm surprised nobody reported things I'm experiencing with it

[13:40] <NemokoschKiwi> like it opens slightly off, there are scrollbars in both directions and sometimes if you click them, the whole thing will just close

[16:16] <coleman> fin and I reviewed the site build. The build environment I set up for Altai-Man's site 8 months ago came in handy, and it was more straightforward than anticipated

[16:17] <coleman> I have some notes that I need to process into scripts.

[16:17] <raschip> The new doc site is looking very good

[16:22] <rf_> How is the site being deployed? Bare metal or docker or ?

[16:36] <raschip> What's the intent of the new docs instance? I'm willing to contribute to the docs and maybe get into Cro, should I use the instance of the new doc website for reading the docs and report issues or it's meant just for work on the site itself for now?

[16:39] <rf> Its intended to replace the existing docs when its done

[16:39] <rf> That's all I know D:

[16:46] <coleman> The first method of deployment will likely be pure static files in an nginx container

[16:46] <coleman> if the docs build is successful, there's a folder called rendered_html, which should be a totally self-contained web root

[16:48] <coleman> After that is working well, we should create a Cro-based container as well

[16:49] <coleman> Cro is a dependency of the build, but at the tail end of the build it's possible to serve with any web server, too

[16:52] <rf> I see

[17:06] <rf> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/pull/45 Fixup table styles, requested by Finanalyst

[17:07] <rf> I think we should probably do the buttons at some point too.

[18:08] <coleman> Added an ssh deploy key to doc-website, doc soon, as well

[18:08] <coleman> some may get an email from GitHub about it. That's me.

[21:40] <coleman> Automated builds are still a WIP, but here is a container using static assets compiled from main

[21:40] <coleman> podman run -p 8080:80 --name raku quay.io/colemanx/raku-doc-website

[21:40] <coleman> that should be a public image.

[21:40] <coleman> I do not know if we have an official registry, yet, or what it ought to be

[21:41] <coleman> I'm going to proceed with just my own stuff; then work with infra team to factor it out into something shared
