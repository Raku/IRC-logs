[01:07] <cfa> [Coke]: i'm seeing a few failures like this,

[01:07] <cfa> # Failed test 'Pod::FormattingCode<2463305740736>.type<C<Cool>> should be C<Cool> - bad parent FormattingCode - self reference'

[01:07] <cfa> (the self-reference failure is correct)

[01:08] <cfa> there are also a number of false positives like this:

[01:08] <cfa> 'L<C<Bool>|/routine/Bool> should be L<C<Bool>|/type/Bool> - bad link'

[01:08] <cfa> i.e. methods that match known types

[13:34] <[Coke]> cfa: that allows anything with a link to /routine/* to pass

[13:35] <[Coke]> sounded like the first item with the formattingcode was that the test was OK, but the output was badly rendered.

[14:22] <cfa> [Coke]: 👍

[14:22] <cfa> should i rebase   normalise-type-links

[14:22] <cfa> onto main?

[14:23] <cfa> (or is having it as a child of your test branch convenient for now?)

[14:23] <cfa> we're down to 62 failures btw

[14:48] *** cfa left
[14:54] <[Coke]> I was going to rebase and squash commits but if you're downstream I didn't want to break it.

[14:54] <[Coke]> can you rebase when I'm done and be OK?

[14:55] <[Coke]> (and force push, there'd be a force push in there)

[15:04] <[Coke]> ... oops, he left.

[15:04] <[Coke]> .ask cfa - is it ok if I rebase test-links branch and squash commits and force push?

[15:12] *** cfa joined
[15:12] <cfa> [Coke]: sure, please go ahead

[15:12] <cfa> i'll force push a revised branch (rebased onto main) within the next hour or so

[15:13] <cfa> remaining automated rewrites are possible but probably more error prone; given the number of failures we have, curated edits seem to make more sense?

[15:14] <cfa> perhaps we can automate stuff like B<Str> => L<C<Str>|/type/Str> if it's recurrent

[15:23] <[Coke]> .. why is that different commits?

[15:23] <[Coke]> I think the branch is rebased on main and is now one commit

[15:45] *** rf joined
[15:46] <cfa> why is what different commits?

[15:47] <cfa> is Geth misreporting something?

[15:48] <[Coke]> I just squashed everything and pushed a single commit, so I'm not sure why geth is reporting the old individual commits there... but it was a force push, so not normal anyway

[15:48] <cfa> ah okay

[15:48] <cfa> i'll refresh my branch in a sec

[15:48] <cfa> so you can take another look

[20:28] <raiph> o/

[20:29] <raiph> First, thanks ugexe++ for fixing up some doc links in an SO answer I wrote

[20:31] <raiph> Second, is there some group initiative related to such updating

[20:34] <raiph> Third, is there a plan to bring missing content back online?

[20:40] <raiph> I ask the last because I'm thinking how best to go through my 420 answers

[20:41] <raiph> And I've yet to find the content I linked to in some cases

[20:41] <raiph> So I'm thinking it's gone for the time being (and maybe for good)

[20:42] <raiph> More generally there are issues like that

[20:43] <raiph> Content moving, sections being renamed, etc

[20:43] <raiph> And I'm wondering if it's best to wait a year or so for that to settle

[20:44] <raiph> For example, most of the links ugexe updated don't arrive at their intended target

[20:44] <raiph> Some go to the right page but not the section

[20:44] <raiph> Others go to the wrong page though the right (new) one is in place

[20:45] <raiph> For others still the original content doesn't seem to currently be in place anywhere in the site

[20:57] <raiph> For reference, here's the sample SO that ugexe updated:

[20:57] <raiph> https://stackoverflow.com/a/54713872/1077672

[20:59] <raiph> And here is his revision work: https://stackoverflow.com/posts/54713872/revisions

[21:04] <raiph> Ah, I've got an idea about how best to go forward.

[21:05] <raiph> Anyhow, any related info / comments / links appreciated

[21:05] <raiph> Goodnight!

[21:14] *** raiph left
[23:35] <[Coke]> Yes, we are trying to fix all missing content and #ids. - if you see a class of items missing that isn't on the doc/website issue list, please ping us.
