[00:59] <[Coke]> Ugh. not being able to build OpenSSL on mac m2 is getting to be a blocker.

[01:18] <cfa> what's the issue?

[01:19] <[Coke]> https://github.com/sergot/openssl/issues/100

[01:20] <cfa> oh, odd

[02:12] <[Coke]> Made some progress on that ticket - at least I think I have compatible versions of the openssl lib and raku

[02:12] <[Coke]> commented.

[02:49] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/milestone/4 is 33% done (That's the one I set to be done by end of March).

[02:54] <[Coke]> several of these are PRs that are done or mostly done, a few are more meta than docs.

[02:58] <[Coke]> Need to close 1.1 tickets a day to make it.

[03:06] <coleman> I've migrated all CI containers off my personal server into the raku-infra Hetzner

[03:31] <coleman> I need to make the "hourly" build into an "every two hours" build, because we're burning too many build minutes right now

[03:31] <coleman> The build is too slow, so if we can speed it up we can bring back that higher frequency

[03:32] <coleman> every PR will still be built, though

[04:41] <coleman> deployed prod so we can start collecting logs

[04:42] <coleman> i checked the dev server and the new logging config indeed adds more access logging

[04:43] <coleman> so that's why i pushed to prod

[04:45] <coleman> oh i'm a dummy i forgot to update the highlighters on my new server

[04:48] <coleman> rebuilding on the old agents...

[05:11] <coleman> fixed

[10:10] <lizmat> I wonder whether  there should be a distinct way to link to a module in the ecosystem

[18:00] <cfa> lizmat: xt/type-graph.rakutest passes for me

[18:01] <cfa> (after [Coke]'s changes, everything passes in test and xtest here)

[18:01] <lizmat> maybe it's something I need to install ?

[18:02] <[Coke]> all deps are listed in the meta

[18:03] <cfa> is graphviz (dot) installed?

[18:03] <lizmat> i guess not

[18:03] <lizmat> yup

[18:03] <lizmat> so how do I install that?

[18:03] <coleman> This weekend I will work on Raku/doc CI

[18:04] <[Coke]> we shouldn't require dot

[18:04] <coleman> And bringing that stuff into public view

[18:04] <[Coke]> how is the test failing?

[18:04] <lizmat> Could not find Doc::TypeGraph

[18:04] <coleman> I needed dot running the build script last night. ^^^

[18:04] <cfa> [Coke]: hmm, type-graph.rakutest depends on Doc::TypeGraph which has a dot dep 

[18:04] <lizmat> and installing that fails because dot:from<bin> failed

[18:04] <coleman> Needed graphviz static libs

[18:04] <[Coke]> lizmat: 'zef install --deps-only .'

[18:04] <coleman> shared libs rather

[18:05] <[Coke]> pretty sure brew has graphviz

[18:05] <[Coke]> but this test may be going away soon, you can ignore it

[18:05] <lizmat> ok, installing with --exclude="dot" --/test

[18:06] <lizmat> and then the test passes

[21:26] <[Coke]> down to 464 open issues in raku/doc

[21:26] <[Coke]> we were well over 500 before the new site went live.

[21:29] <[Coke]> lizmat, have a local patch for the Complex.sign dupe, re-installing raku, will test, then push

[21:29] <[Coke]> lizmat++ cfa++

[21:30] <[Coke]> coleman: let me know if you want to chat about the CI work. I've put thoughts down on various tickets your assigned to. I think we were running out of credits at one point, so definitely want to be mindful of that. If we have an agent that keeps a clone, will speed things up, since the tests create cached pod files

[21:31] <[Coke]> We can also add a "citest" that is bigger than "test" but smaller than "xtest" (or just make "test" whatever we want "citest" to be.)

[21:32] <[Coke]> you can skip 04-pod.rakutest to start with (that's the one that creates the cached pod, takes a minute)
