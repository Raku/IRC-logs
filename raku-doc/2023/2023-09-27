[17:43] <coleman> This isn't okay https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/304

[17:43] <coleman> "I will do this", "I will do that"

[17:44] <coleman> This is premature abstraction for use cases that haven't come up yet

[17:45] <coleman> It makes the project hard to contribute too

[22:41] <NemokoschKiwi> Ha, I think this issue is also premature. It's not like there is a whole crowd of people waiting to contribute, and basically it has been known from the very start that this site (very much like Oleksandr's site) is someone's individual effort to get to a working site.

[22:45] <NemokoschKiwi> I could get around when I did want to tackle something, and even if the exposure isn't as good as it was with JJ Merelo, Richard is still very much among the few people who are actually willing to explain how something works. I can't see how it helps if we tell this single person "do _something_ about the architecture", without even setting a clear

[22:45] <NemokoschKiwi> path or goal
