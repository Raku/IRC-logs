[13:05] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: The RakuAST grammar does, causing difference in rendering.  Since

[13:05] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: the I<...> is really only for a little emphasis, it feels ok to

[15:41] <[Coke]> L<(foo|bar)|url> - my human expectation is that the ()s are wrapping it somehow, but I think the L could reasonably break on the | ther. can we \| the first |?

[15:43] <lizmat> one approach would be to allow () as an alternate letterless markup

[15:43] <[Coke]> your fix to make it the last one is fine.

[15:43] <lizmat> no, it's not

[15:43] <lizmat> L«C<prefix:<|>>|/language/operators#prefix_|»

[15:44] <[Coke]> right, to make it more like the human parsing. :)

[15:44] <[Coke]> ah

[15:45] <[Coke]> should I not run a test with 7e6e5a

[15:45] <[Coke]> should I not run a test with c7e6e5a, then?

[15:45] <lizmat> no

[15:46] <lizmat> I mean, indeed don't run it

[15:47] <[Coke]> definitely looking forward to switching all our testing over to rakuast in raku/doc, thanks for all this effort!

[15:48] <lizmat> yeah, it should be at least 5x as fast then

[15:56] <lizmat> I've just decided that I'm not going to open the can of worms wrt escaping |

[15:56] <lizmat> if you want to use | inside a L<foo(a|b)|url>

[15:56] <lizmat> then you should use V<>

[15:57] <lizmat> if you want to use | inside a L<fooV<(a|b)>|url>

[15:57] <lizmat> in the case of L«C<prefix:<|>>|/language/operators#prefix_|»

[15:58] <lizmat> the :<|> is effectively doing that already, as the <|> there is a letterless markup

[15:59] <lizmat> the only problem is that the Pod::To::Text doesn't render C<V<>> correctly  :-(
