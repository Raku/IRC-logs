[16:24] <[Coke]> the docs now have     multi sub rotor(*@cycle, \source, Bool() :$partial --> Seq:D)

[16:25] <[Coke]> but this isn't valid in rakudo ATM. the source says "# We have to emulate :(*@ [@list, \tail]) because the grammar wont cut it."

[16:25] <lizmat> well, the actual sig is **@foo I believe

[16:25] <[Coke]> I can see an argument of showing it either way, but if we keep this, we have to not test this sub's sig.

[16:25] <[Coke]> so the other option is to do the same cheat as rakudo and perhaps document the cheat.

[16:25] <lizmat> and that doesn't tell anybody anything, I'd say

[16:26] <[Coke]> OK, will make the compilation test pass (with a skip), and add a comment (not user facing) about the sig diff.

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: The syntax shown here is expressive, but not technically legal. Leaving

[16:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: it for pedagogical reasons.

[16:31] <[Coke]> Thanks again everyone for getting us moving again on docs!

[16:45] <[Coke]> down to 433 open tickets on raku/doc

[17:12] <[Coke]> coleman: removing https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki/Production-Environment which was only a placeholder so far, assuming this will really go in the Infra docs

[17:18] <coleman> THat's good

[17:18] <coleman> Thank you for the heads up

[17:28] <[Coke]> added a side bar to the wiki so we now must organize it manually.

[17:28] <[Coke]> but now we can push old stuff down into "archive" without obsucuring recent stuff.

[17:28] <coleman> good iea
