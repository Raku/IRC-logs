[12:25] <[Coke]> .

[12:26] <[Coke]> lizmat: I don't know if it's helpful, but if you run make xtest with rakudo HEAD, buried in there is a small list of AST classes that still need docs. :)

[12:28] <[Coke]> I figure you've been reducing that list already. I've been trying to clean up some of the example failures. I think the next "tricky" one is that we don't like leading whitespace, but there are some examples with POD *inside* the code that is indented, not sure if that indent is required to avoid processing as the pod from the main file.

[12:28] <[Coke]> Thanks for getting these in there, appreciate it!

[12:28] <[Coke]> afk

[12:32] <lizmat> Coke: there are *many*, **many** classes that need docs...

[12:32] <lizmat> at least 450 more

[13:20] <[Coke]> ... then the test isn't picking those up. :)

[13:21] <lizmat> because they're not mentioned anywhere yet ?

[13:21] <lizmat> and/or the test is not using "use v6.e.PREVIEW" or "use experimental :rakuast" ?

[13:22] <[Coke]> ah, yes, I thought it was checking source, it's checking docs. so doc/Type/RakuAST/Doc.rakudoc mentions StatementList and VarDeclaration/Simple

[13:22] <[Coke]> and so two failures in rakudoc-l. No worries, that'll get sorted out as we go.

[13:22] <lizmat> yup

[13:57] <tbrowder__> have the current public docs been rebuilt recently? the reason i ask is i haven’t seen a change from my

[13:57] <tbrowder__> *expected chg from my merged PR

[13:58] <tbrowder__> and following web edit

[14:41] <[Coke]> i don't think anyone pressed the publish button. can you verify that docs-dev has your change?

[14:41] <[Coke]> if so, I'll press the button next time I have a gap between calls

[15:33] <tbrowder__> i’ll have to ck later, thnx

[16:47] <[Coke]> coleman: looks like docs-dev is down?

[16:57] <coleman> looking into it

[17:06] <coleman> it's weird. The port is open, the container is up, the container's logging.

[17:07] <coleman> continuing to look

[17:07] <lizmat> URL?

[17:18] <coleman> docs-dev.raku.org

[17:18] <lizmat> error code 521

[17:18] <lizmat> :-(

[17:19] <lizmat> some kind of config issue on Cloudflare?  pointing to the wrong IP?  any requests being logged ?

[17:19] <coleman> I don't think it's external networking

[17:20] <coleman> a curl on localhost hangs. it could be a messed up container pull

[17:20] <lizmat> so in issue inside Cloudflare you mean?  Or is it DNS?  It's always DNS

[17:23] <coleman> I don't think so...

[17:23] <coleman> rebooting the box now

[17:24] <coleman> What's strange is the image works fine: podman run -p 8080:80 quay.io/colemanx/raku-doc-website:latest

[17:25] <coleman> So I suspect local corruption of the image. 

[17:25] <coleman> But that's kind of a wild guess

[17:27] <lizmat> that would be... icky?

[17:28] <coleman> I think we're back

[17:28] <[Coke]> last failures of examples compilation are the "=table" entries.

[17:28] <[Coke]> (dev) I see it

[17:28] <coleman> I have never seen that before. I really do think it was a corrupt storage for podman.

[17:29] <coleman> The remedy is a root command: `podman system reset`

[17:30] <coleman> we ran out of disk space yesterday, so it does feel like something that could have been fallout from that

[17:30] <[Coke]> tbrowder__: https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/unicode_ascii now says "whitespace whitespace characters" on the section heading.

[20:56] <lizmat> coleman: seems docs-dev is down again?

[21:17] <coleman> what the devil

[21:18] <coleman> I did not intervene but it seems to be back online

[21:18] <coleman> apologies

[21:19] <lizmat> not for me

[21:22] <coleman> the https is up, but http is down https://docs-dev.raku.org/ ?

[21:24] <lizmat> aaaah...   I guess my IRC client assumes http:// if there is no scheme

[21:24] <lizmat> good catch.... but perhaps there should be a redirect on port 80 to send to https:// ??

[21:25] <coleman> I've opened 80 on the load balancer

[21:28] <lizmat> there's no way to tell the load balancer to redirect http://:80 to https://:443 ?

[21:28] <coleman> Production does a redirect to https

[21:28] <lizmat> ah, ok, then please disregard my comments and sorry for the noise  :-)

[21:28] <lizmat> afk&

[21:29] <coleman> not at all; I myself forgot

[22:19] *** sena_kun left
[23:02] <[Coke]> coleman: can I force a new build of docs-dev here: https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website 

[23:02] <[Coke]> ?

[23:02] <[Coke]> (vs. -prod for the prod site)

[23:03] <[Coke]> ah, no, my notes say the build is done elsewhere... but the notes don't say where.

[23:04] <coleman> you can

[23:04] <coleman> the dev site is updated by cron

[23:05] <coleman> ah but you can't speed up the interval from there, no

[23:07] <coleman> the next run is in 22 min

[23:13] <[Coke]> how frequently does it go?

[23:14] <[Coke]> opened some tickets on Collections because it fails on case-insensitive file systems.

[23:16] <coleman> every 30 min is the systemd timer interval

[23:18] <coleman> OnCalendar=*:0/30 to be precise

[23:23] <[Coke]> doc-website url at buildkite says last build was 2:07pm (times there in... utc?)

[23:24] <coleman> not sure, actually

[23:24] <coleman> the CI container runs in Frankfurt

[23:26] <coleman> https://docs-dev.raku.org/about

[23:30] <coleman> https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/settings/schedules/3d89827f-8a40-4ddf-a2af-6bdd3fa8c0d2

[23:30] <coleman> We're in a lull

[23:31] <coleman> in the scheduled builds
