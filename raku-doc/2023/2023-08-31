[12:25] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/refactor_searchbar_scss: 

[12:25] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/refactor_searchbar_scss: The background to the modal popup which the Search autocomplete creates was transparent.

[12:25] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/refactor_searchbar_scss: The problem was that the SCSS was split between too many files.

[12:25] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/refactor_searchbar_scss: A successful idiom for plugins is to put all the common SCSS into one '_xxx-common' file, which is imported into the SCSS files for 'xxx-dark' and 'xxx-light'. The latter two create the styling for the dark and light themes using `$variables`.

[12:25] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/refactor_searchbar_scss: The css files are then generated.
