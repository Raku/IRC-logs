[17:13] <[Coke]> ^^ Does that PR look like it changed the UI to anyone?

[17:14] <[Coke]> (just looked at fin's site, didn't see a noticable change in the columns)

[19:24] <[Coke]> man, it's been a while since I've been so slammed by spam. Some *&^#$ took my name, address, phone number, email, and sub'd me up to hundreds of web sites, businesses asking for a callback, etc.

[19:27] <finanalyst> coke: have I missed a request? I think I changed everything for PR 296

[19:32] <[Coke]> I merged the other one about the CSS, thanks.

[19:32] <finanalyst> coke: I'll sort that now

[19:32] <[Coke]> finanalyst: not sure if you heard, Util is working on a "invoke this raku example" javascript button for the code snippets.

[19:33] *** RakuIRCLogger__ left
[19:33] <[Coke]> He's got something working locally, I sent him docs on how to run things locally (so he can avoid code injection and CORS issues), and if/when his PR comes in, if you could also review it, that'd be great. no idea when to expect it

[19:33] <finanalyst> coke: I didn't know. Does he know I had a button working?

[19:34] <[Coke]> Nope.

[19:34] <[Coke]> Please feel free to reach out and coordinate with him so we can avoid duplication of effort.

[19:34] <finanalyst> OK

[19:58] <[Coke]> https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/2581

[19:58] <[Coke]> Not sure why the site build is failing there, looks like it just stopped, not failed.

[20:01] <[Coke]> btw "as per review" isn't a great commit message; you should still be describing the change you made.

[20:01] <[Coke]> I can't see a way to restart the buildkite build, and I don't think I've seen them before on PRs, so will merge this one. let's keep an eye on if it gets deployed to -dev

[20:03] <[Coke]> ah you already merged it, I was very confused for a second

[20:09] <finanalyst> coke: sorry about the msg. I regretted it as soon as I committed it.

[20:16] <finanalyst> coke: the failure was due a bad config. I did not pick this up earlier because that queue had stalled.

[20:16] <finanalyst> Should be OK now. 

[20:59] <coleman> hm, looks like a couple of buildkite agents died.

[20:59] <coleman> looking into it

[21:09] <coleman> a power-cycle of the underlying VM (app-04 in Hetzner) seems to have fixed it. This was just a couple of CI agents, so no downtime.
