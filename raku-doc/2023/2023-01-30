[00:11] <coleman> Go for small, incremental changes so it won't be a shock to others; thanks for jumping in

[00:12] <rf>  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out the styling for the searchbar auto complete, but it seems to be set in both CSS and JS

[15:38] <NemokoschKiwi> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/discussions/51 since I'm this kind of GH Discussions freak, I feel obliged to advertise this question a little bit. Just to raise awareness.

[15:51] <[Coke]> Did you convert that from the issue? thanks.

[18:53] <rf> I'll be a bit on that search auto-complete spacing thing, very busy this week.

[18:55] <[Coke]> Thanks for looking at it.

[18:56] <[Coke]> I think the only blocker left for go live is improving the in line search to show class names for methods

[18:57] <[Coke]> I'll do another QA pass. I don't use themes on Chrome, can someone point me at a guide on how to switch between the light/dark themes?

[19:03] <rf> At the bottom of the page

[19:03] <rf> Should see a "change theme" or something like that

[19:03] <rf> I think it's just JavaScript.

[19:05] <[Coke]> D'oh! I was looking for a browser setting.

[19:06] <[Coke]> rf++

[19:07] <rf> Yeah thankfully I found that button before I went down that route too :D
