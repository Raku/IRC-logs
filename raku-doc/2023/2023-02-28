[00:49] <[Coke]> doing a site publish to publish these changes

[00:50] <cfa> [Coke]++

[00:53] <[Coke]> ugh

[00:53] <[Coke]> something in that has broken css for the site.

[00:53] <[Coke]> I tested it in dev first, to no avail

[00:53] <[Coke]> (it worked fine there)

[00:54] <cfa> i just encountered that but it's working after another refresh

[00:54] <cfa> (or at least, a force refresh)

[00:55] <[Coke]> i tried redploying the previous version as part of this. deploying latest again...

[00:55] <[Coke]> oh. looks like I just deployed the latest 3 times? apparently redeploy on an old version just pushes the latest

[00:56] <[Coke]> the colors on the main page are wrong, syntax highlighting is missing...

[00:59] <cfa> working for me

[01:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website: coke assigned to finanalyst Issue css broken https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/163

[01:00] <Geth> ¦ doc-website: coke assigned to dontlaugh Issue css broken https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/163

[01:01] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/163

[01:01] <[Coke]> I've cleared cache, no help.

[01:01] <cfa> it's not working for me in edge -- i'm getting a green template with no highlighting

[01:01] <cfa> but force refresh/reload worked in firefox and vivaldi

[01:02] <cfa> caching?

[01:02] <[Coke]> not here, as I cleared cache?

[01:02] <cfa> oh, working in edge now

[01:02] <cfa> in an incognito/private window

[01:03] <[Coke]> probably need cache buster on new css when deploying.

[01:04] <cfa> does it work in a private chrome window for you?

[01:04] <[Coke]> e.g. foo.css?id=1     # increase with each change

[01:06] <[Coke]> private chrome, yes. but reloading in the main window, clearing cache, all does nothing. wtf

[01:11] <[Coke]> ok, well, if it's just me, that's fine.

[01:12] <[Coke]> seems fine in ff, incognito.. ah. safari has the same issue

[01:13] <cfa> it's not just you -- same issue for me in non-private edge window

[01:13] <cfa> (which is basically chrome under the hood, i think)

[02:12] *** rf left

[06:13] <Voldenet> `green mode` is probably related to my patch somehow, it means that `light` and `dark` themes are switched off

[06:19] <Voldenet> light or dark mode css files are supposed to have _disabled_ attribute set

[06:21] <Voldenet> if you attach debugger, see if things are building properly here https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/Website/plugins/ogdenwebb/core.js#L8

[06:22] <Voldenet> (I can't reproduce the issue anywhere, so it could be some caching problem, initial themes resolving ignore values from localStorage)

[06:22] <Voldenet> tested on edge, chrome and firefox

[12:59] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4220

[13:27] <[Coke]> Voldenet: if both themes are switched off, how do I turn them back on? toggle theme no longer works for me.

[13:28] <[Coke]> also, something has impacted the highlighting; for those who aren't in green mode, can you still see the code highlighting?

[13:29] <[Coke]> I have $dayjob today, but please let me know if there's something I can be checking in the console, etc.

[14:14] <Voldenet> [Coke] every theme has lists of links to enable or disable, so you can set breakpoint here: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/Website/plugins/ogdenwebb/core.js#L21 and see what elements are going to be disabled/enabled

[14:14] <Voldenet> afterwards run change_theme("dark") or change_theme("light")

[14:15] <Voldenet> If css files are not loading properly, then you'll see elements as being disabled/enabled just fine, but nothing will work

[14:25] <Voldenet> if change_theme returns false it means that the link[rel="stylesheet"] elements were not indexed properly during initialization at all

[14:28] <[Coke]> Voldenet: I just got 5m to go check the site; it's fine today.

[14:28] <[Coke]> O_o;

[14:39] <[Coke]> did your PR make the themes better integrated with ff?

[14:42] <Voldenet> yes, did check that page switching works

[14:43] <Voldenet> s/page/page style/

[14:44] <[Coke]> how to trigger in ff?

[14:46] <Voldenet> https://i.imgur.com/m30Tfm4.png

[14:47] <[Coke]> I went to themes, preferred dark, no change (maybe I already clicked on a theme choice in the site, though)

[14:47] <Voldenet> I didn't change the behaviour that was there before – the initially loaded theme name is persisted in localStorage

[14:47] <[Coke]> ok. can we also get it working with picking dark in the themes settings?

[14:48] <[Coke]> Or should that also be working? (let me kill my cookies)

[14:49] <[Coke]> killing cookies and reloading, didn't respect my "prefer dark theme" choice, fyi. Menu integration works fine.

[14:49] <Voldenet> cookies =/= localStorage

[14:50] *** rf joined
[14:50] <Voldenet> Maybe persisting the theme change on click only makes more sense

[14:50] <[Coke]> ah, thanks, yes. checked the "data" boxes on clear as well, and it's all good. Nifty, thanks!

[14:50] <Voldenet> > https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/Website/plugins/ogdenwebb/core.js#L44

[14:51] <Voldenet> it could be changed easily to not persist the theme from prefers-color-scheme

[14:51] <[Coke]> I'd definitely consider a PR for that.

[14:51] <[Coke]> Voldenet++

[14:52] <Voldenet> (in that case click would have to be changed to use state variable for this, because it uses the localStorage to keep the `currently chosen theme`)

[17:17] <[Coke]> cfa: renaming the test files is on my list.

[17:17] <[Coke]> I need to make sure 'make test' still works when I do that.

[17:18] <[Coke]> if you want to do that, please let me know!

[17:19] <cfa> oh, please go ahead (unless you need a hand)

[17:19] <cfa> i'm looking at tweaking a few examples today

[17:19] <[Coke]> sounds good. Thanks.

[17:24] <coleman> [Coke] would you mind doing an experiment for me 

[17:24] <coleman> Can you log into Hetzner and try to issue yourself an API token?

[17:32] <coleman> My cursory reading of the permissions in Hetzner is that you can't. But always better to test.

[17:32] <coleman> No need to try anything with the token, just poke around the UI

[17:33] <[Coke]> api tokens under security is grayed out

[17:33] <[Coke]> so, can't even.

[17:33] <coleman> Thanks for testing! That is what they're docs said would be the case.

[17:34] <coleman> I think only admins can issue them. Hetzner's permissions aren't super granular.

[17:34] <[Coke]> the change to rakutest requires a few more change than just file renames, but should be fine. Running a full maketest right now.

[17:34] <[Coke]> coleman: no idea why I got "green mode" after the last push, and for less than a day.

[17:36] <coleman> I have seen it before. The next time it happens, I'll use the browser tools. Perhaps there is some boolean-type logic that is being affected by browser caching.

[17:36] <coleman> Caching feels related, but there may be something more subtle.

[17:37] <[Coke]> clearing cache didn't seem to help, but maybe i missed local storage

[17:40] <coleman> I'm inclined to live with this for a bit. I am a bit worried about complicating our build process.

[17:40] <coleman> My next action for the build is to make it public

[17:41] <coleman> And for that I need to get it off my personal server and into the collective Hetzner :)

[17:41] <coleman> Just to make absolutely sure we don't leak any secrets

[17:42] <coleman> It'll be easier for everyone to grok the container build once they can see.

[17:45] <Voldenet> all files are served with `cache-control: max-age=14400` header

[17:48] <coleman> Is that always the web server? Or can html tags do that

[17:49] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/098dae258f

[17:49] <coleman> (me)

[17:49] <[Coke]> I don't think html attributes can impact the actual http headers, but it's been a minute

[17:49] <Voldenet> they can't, that's the point

[17:50] <[Coke]> s/impact/change/ - I think they can influence the cache behavior, ofc.

[17:51] <Voldenet> to be honest, best strategy to prevent caching I know (and it's a problem I've seen 100 times) is to generate unique filenames for unique files

[17:51] <Voldenet> I mean, it wouldn't prevent caching, just it would prevent serving stale version as the new one

[17:51] <[Coke]> Voldenet: I've historically done the dumb number ID on each prod release.

[17:52] <Voldenet> it sort of works, but if it's manual you end up forgetting to change the id

[17:52] <Voldenet> and if it's auto you end up overserving

[17:52] <[Coke]> so, dumb number, deployment CI updates the number, then every request for an internal js/css/etc. calls with ?id=xxx ; you only have to deal with telling so many users "please clear your cache" before you get this sorted. :)

[17:53] <[Coke]> better overserving than telling users to clear their cache.

[17:53] <coleman> Voldenet: that's what I've seen googling this issue. So perhaps our build script can generate names based on git sha

[17:53] <Voldenet> you end up overserving a lot of unchanged js/css then

[17:53] <coleman> a query param works too, but I like random filenames better

[17:54] <coleman> anyways I gotta go right now. FWIW I'm not wild about the fact that we have to reach into Finanlyst's personal repo to make changes like this

[17:54] <Voldenet> sha1 of the file contents is pretty good way to make sure things are unique

[17:55] <coleman> unless i'm missing something

[17:55] <[Coke]> which repo of his are we using directly?

[17:55] <coleman> (which I probably am. I don't understand the plugin system)

[17:55] <[Coke]> one of the raku deps?

[17:56] <coleman> This is what CI invokes to build the artifact

[17:56] <coleman> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/bin_files/build-site

[17:56] <[Coke]> Collection is a module in the ecosystem - we're tied to a specific version so it shouldn't be any surprises.

[17:57] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/META6.json#L14

[17:57] <[Coke]> Ah, no, it's that version or higher.

[17:57] <coleman> I'm okay with depending on his modules

[17:57] <[Coke]> But we are OK to rely on things in the ecosystem; if we need to, we can fork them into community modules or raku/ itself if it's a docs-only thing.

[17:58] <[Coke]> oh, OK.

[17:58] <coleman> I just would like to make things a little less opaque and magical.

[17:58] <coleman> let's just start with more comments in the code lol

[17:58] <coleman> I just remember quite clearly being blocked last year on pending merges to this and that

[17:59] <coleman> That's another reason why I want to keep this a static site for now. Keep it as simple as possible so that we can always have live docs :)

[17:59] <coleman> Then document the more complex stuff :)

[19:00] <[Coke]> coleman: none of the ip addresses I see in hetzner match the public ip for the doc site

[19:00] <coleman> it's behind a load balancer

[19:01] <[Coke]> ok, but the load balancer ip doesn't match either.

[19:55] <cfa> and yeah, i think it is

[20:03] <cfa> good stuff

[20:07] <[Coke]> Thank you!

[20:12] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/169

[20:12] <cfa> it's a low priority issue

[20:17] <[Coke]> coleman: can I see the schedule for the dev site? pipeline says nothing scheduled.

[20:18] <cfa> it recently updated

[20:19] <cfa> fwiw

[20:19] <cfa> e.g. i see my change to Mu

[20:19] <[Coke]> yup. was going to consider starting a manual one, then thought to check the schedule..

[20:40] <cfa> okay, i think that's enough of that for one day

[20:40] <cfa> q. time consuming

[20:44] <[Coke]> cfa++

[20:45] <coleman> [Coke] The dev site is automatically self-updating. It uses a cron job (technically a systemd timer) to re-pull the latest container every 30 minutes

[20:46] <coleman> We expose a button for prod, because we can't use a cron-style strategy

[20:46] <coleman> not at the moment, anyway

[20:46] <coleman> check Raku/infra for the configs

[20:46] <[Coke]> ah, it's a cron job somewhere - there is also a way to schedule it from the pipeline screen, which is what I was looking at.

[20:47] <coleman> That should be prod-only

[20:48] <coleman> I am planning on giving you a lever to pull for dev, as well

[20:48] <coleman> And perhaps even fancy stuff like pre-merge deployments (for funkier changes)

[20:48] <coleman> Right now this was simple and expedient, though.

[20:50] <[Coke]> yup, that's fine.

[23:30] *** NemokoschKiwi joined
[23:30] <cfa> hey NemokoschKiwi 

[23:31] <NemokoschKiwi> sssh :D

[23:31] <coleman> hahah :)

[23:32] <NemokoschKiwi> well, I also wanted to bring up the milestones...

[23:33] <NemokoschKiwi> first off, it's REALLY good to see that issues are being sorted out, solved, migrated to more suitable repos etc.

[23:34] <NemokoschKiwi> I don't know if the number of issues and their categories is traced anywhere but these days the progress would probably look really good

[23:35] <NemokoschKiwi> the thing with the issues assigned to the next milestone is... well, I'm afraid the same can be said for the majority of issues from now on...

[23:36] <NemokoschKiwi> they are hardly "actionable". They make perfect sense as issues but what to do about them is a whole another story.

[23:43] <[Coke]> So what's your recommendation?

[23:46] <NemokoschKiwi> semi-ironically: to ask the same question from the people who opened those issues

[23:46] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: cfbb963a0c | (Will Coleda)++ | t/04-pod6.rakutest

[23:46] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: Remove obsolete xt test preventing .pod files

[23:46] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: rename files from pod6 to rakudoc

[23:47] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: 7eda3948e0 | (Will Coleda)++ | 18 files

[23:47] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: track file rename from pod6 to rakudoc

[23:47] <Geth> ¦ doc/rakudoc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/7eda3948e0

[23:47] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke++ created pull request #4222: Rakudoc

[23:47] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4222

[23:47] <[Coke]> ... the ones who opened the issues don't set the priority on resolving them.

[23:48] <[Coke]> so if you're ask is "what's the priority" - it's to work on them in the order suggested by the milestones.

[23:49] <[Coke]> Once all the tickets in milestone A are complete, we can start working on the next one (whether that means moving them to an earlier milestone or just working on them in place will be decided then, and will depend in large part on whether the milestone is complete)

[23:49] <[Coke]> it sounds like you're complaining that tickets in milestone B (in this case, 2023-Quarter 2) are not actionable - they aren't intended to be worked on now. that's why they're in the later milestone.

[23:50] <[Coke]> s/is complete/'s due date has passed/

[23:51] <NemokoschKiwi> I'm talking about "milestone A" according to this terminology

[23:51] <[Coke]> so, the tickets in 2023-Quarter 1 ? What's the question specifically?

[23:52] <[Coke]> that's this listing: https://github.com/Raku/doc/milestone/4

[23:52] <NemokoschKiwi> Yes, this listing

[23:53] <[Coke]> https://docs-dev.raku.org/oops #404 now working

[23:53] <[Coke]> Will push 404 work once Richard tells me his work is safe.

[23:54] <cfa> [Coke]++

[23:54] <NemokoschKiwi> looks pretty cool haha

[23:54] <NemokoschKiwi> back to the "milestoned" issues...

[23:55] <NemokoschKiwi> "What's really autothreading and is it used correctly?" "Is @*MODULES spec?" "No mention of NFG in the docs?" "Docs on exceptions do not mention failures at all."

[23:55] <NemokoschKiwi> To recite a few

[23:55] <NemokoschKiwi> I have read the content of them, mind you

[23:56] <NemokoschKiwi> and it's like... "okay, the problem is well understood - what to do about it now?"

[23:57] <[Coke]> ... write the docs

[23:57] <NemokoschKiwi> which is not to say that they aren't solveable but one will have to keep making decisions - loads of decisions

[23:57] <[Coke]> If you don't see how to answer the general question, then you're probably not going to end up working on those tickets. No worries.

[23:57] <[Coke]> Yes, one will. Not you.

[23:57] <[Coke]> At least, I do not expect it to be you

[23:58] <NemokoschKiwi> somehow I suspect that there aren't so many "ones" though; that's why we actually have an issue-issue

[23:58] <[Coke]> If someone wants to volunteer for a specific ticket, I'm happy to suggest how to approach it. I don't plan on writing up detailed instructions for each ticket when writing the docs is probably only slightly more effort. If I had volunteers/interns/apprentices this calculus would change.
