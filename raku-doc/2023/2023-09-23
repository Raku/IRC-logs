[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: I found the `Bool` page's `pick` doc hard to understand.¹ I eventually figured it out.² I have tried to improve it so it's easier to understand, especially for concrete thinkers.³

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: ¹ I initially thought that the `Bool` class's `pick` was perhaps an especially powerful abstraction which made it a bit difficult to describe and understand, but was ultimately worth the mental effort.

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: ² I concluded the doc was probably just unhelpfully abstract. (Perhaps it was originally copy/pasted from some other class's `pick`?)

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[14:08] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: ³ I concluded the `Bool` variant of `pick` was nice and easy, and I just needed to distill its simplicity while remaining technically correct.
