[16:06] <lizmat> so I started to work on supporting pod in RakuAST

[16:07] <lizmat> and I must admit, I never looked much at the innards of the Pod::Block hierarchy, or the contents of $=pod

[16:07] <lizmat> but what a mess

[16:09] <[Coke]> no doubt.

[16:10] <lizmat> I guess I will need to re-implement this mess, but my ideas are now forming towards a different hierarchy of RakuAST classes

[16:11] <lizmat> that will either QAST to the old Pod::Block mess, or to a new RakuDOC hierarchy that would be much more user friendly

[16:11] <lizmat> does that feel like a plan ?

[16:12] <lizmat> I mean, that:

[16:12] <lizmat> =head1 Foo

[16:12] <lizmat> bar

[16:13] <lizmat> codegennes to a Pod::Heading in which the contents is an array with a Doc::Para with the title of the header  as the first element?

[16:18] <lizmat> ah,  I now see that you can actually have additional lines after a =head1 and still have that be part of the contents

[16:18] <lizmat> TIL

[16:18] <lizmat> do we actually have usage of that feature: I always interpreted it as a title, not as a paragraph

[16:27] <lizmat> Ah, I guess that comes from =head1 being short for =begin head1

[16:28] <lizmat> but oddly enough both codegenn to a Pod::Heading
