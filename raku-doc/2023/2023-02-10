[13:07] <lizmat> at the front page, perhaps change Twitter to Mastodon with https://fosstodon.org/@rakulang as link?

[15:04] <[Coke]> Updated https://github.com/Raku/doc/wiki

[15:05] <[Coke]> rakudoc is a command line tool that basically does a pod 2 text on docs (one source of docs is the raku/docs repo checkout) - you build an index with rakudoc, then it uses that index to find things.

[15:06] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/rakudoc/issues/21 shows some basic usage.

[16:44] <[Coke]> lizmat: opened https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/91

[16:45] <[Coke]> wow. this reminded me to check twitter which I haven't done in a week. my timeline isn't loading

[16:47] <[Coke]> ah, just took 5 minutes. (wow)

[17:02] <[Coke]> coleman: how close are we, do you think, to my made up target date of end of february for go live with the new site? 

[17:03] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/milestone/1

[17:04] <coleman> It's doable

[17:05] <[Coke]> woot

[17:05] <coleman> I will report back soon. Didn't get a chance to do it last weekend

[17:06] <coleman> If I can only put together something hacky, we'll make a phase two plan to make it more suited to long-term use

[17:06] <coleman> For instance, I think we can go live with the container registry we have right now, but we ought to move and centralize on a common Raku registry

[17:07] <coleman> The only one I've seen is for Rakudo, on GitHub's registry, I think

[17:18] <[Coke]> I've been trying to tag tickets with milestones of "needed for go live" and "sometime after"; 

[17:18] <[Coke]> (on doc-website)

[17:18] <[Coke]> That second milestone is just "backlog" right now

[17:23] <[Coke]> if we have any pushback on jit.si usage after the call this weekend, we can switch to a free zoom call.

[17:28] <lizmat> I understand it's going to be at 17:00 UTC, right ?

[17:30] <[Coke]> Yes

[17:30] <[Coke]> Pretty sure Eastern is -5 at the moment.

[17:30] <lizmat> ok, so that'd be 18::00 CET    just mentioning it

[18:11] *** sena_kun joined
[19:06] <[Coke]> to verify, it's tomorrow, yes? Just back from a week of traveling for work here

[19:07] <lizmat> tomorrow would be the 2nd Sat of the month, so yes  :)

[19:16] <rf> I'm UTC-6 and I will be there :)

[19:17] <[Coke]> Glad to hear it. Agenda: I plan to discuss the work I've been doing trying to clean up the repositories/issues/milestones, we'll ask finanalyst how he feels about the outstanding issues on the site in terms of go live, same with coleman

[19:18] <coleman> My mom and dad are supposed to come over for lunch. So you might meet them :)

[19:19] <coleman> Wave to them in the background at least

[19:19] <[Coke]> heh

[19:21] <coleman> Okay, AND i just got a call from a handyman who is looking at my water heater?!

[19:21] <coleman> It might be a crowd :) Please excuse me if I dip in and out

[19:24] <[Coke]> no worries. we'll let you go first or whenever you're ready

[19:24] <[Coke]> also, video not required.
