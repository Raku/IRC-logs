[04:07] <[Coke]> we prefer metathing for most metawords. what about metainformation? dash, space, or one word

[04:10] <[Coke]> meta-information seems correct. but so does metadata. I'll go with the dash for now on that one only

[21:00] <finanalyst> .tell coleman something is out of sync between build-kite and docs.raku.org . The commit ids do not match

[21:02] <finanalyst> @coleman A PR that should fix an issue is in main, build-kite builds it, but the change does not appear in either docs.raku or docs-div.raku

[21:02] <coleman> looking

[21:12] <finanalyst> @coleman: the key change was to have a page title that is not escaped HTML. One link is https://docs.raku.org/routine/<==

[21:13] <coleman> I don't understand

[21:13] <finanalyst> the old version shows &lt;== in the title (tab in the browser), the new version shows <== in the tab

[21:13] <coleman> https://docs-dev.raku.org/routines

[21:13] <coleman> how's that look

[21:14] <finanalyst> The relevant issue is #273

[21:15] <finanalyst> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/273

[21:15] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/routine/%3C== - the title is escaped when it shouldn't be.

[21:16] <[Coke]> the content is ok, it's the title on the browser tab

[21:16] <coleman> ah i see

[21:16] <[Coke]> i verified that it looked right on finanalyst's dev site ansd merged that PR, should be live here by now (was merged yesterday)

[21:17] <coleman> docs-dev look okay?

[21:17] <coleman> https://docs-dev.raku.org/routine/%3C==

[21:17] <coleman> in FF it looks okay to me

[21:19] <coleman> I ran the deploy routine for prod, too

[21:20] <finanalyst> I'm confused!!! It looks OK now.

[21:20] <finanalyst> I'm sure I double checked before bothering you

[21:20] <coleman> it's okay. I did restart the service. Perhaps something is wrong

[21:21] <coleman> Better to say something so we can work out bugs. 

[21:21] <coleman> docs-dev tries to pull the container every 30 minutes

[21:22] <coleman> A container is built from main every 2 hours

[21:22] <finanalyst> Ah. I also looked at the commit id on the build-kite site and the commit-id reported on About

[21:23] <coleman> the timestamp is probably better

[21:23] <coleman> but the commit tells WHAT is up there

[21:24] <finanalyst> On build kite, its 47b496a, and on About its 4c1635335

[21:25] <finanalyst> the time stamps are consistent.

[21:25] <coleman> oh! https://github.com/Raku/doc

[21:25] <coleman> the about shows the content's git sha

[21:25] <coleman> not doc-website

[21:25] <finanalyst> ahhhhh

[21:26] <finanalyst> fair enough. no need to change, 

[21:28] <finanalyst> @coleman: thanks.

[21:28] <coleman> no worries at all! 

[21:44] <coleman> I deactivated the CircleCI webhook on Raku/doc, since it seems to be unused
