[10:14] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/allow_formats_in_code_blocks: Although it only took a change in the Code block template in `Website/plugins/ogdenwebb`, getting it to work with highlighting was not obvious. Basically all HTML tags are replaced with 0xFF chars before highlighting, then put back.

[16:23] <gfldex> Is ther consensus on how to doc emerging behaviour?

[16:48] <coleman> What's a good example, do you think?

[16:53] <gfldex> Empty

[16:53] <coleman> I'm not familiar with that; it's not released yet, I presume?

[16:53] <gfldex> It shows up in .map and "infix" if.

[16:54] <gfldex> Empty is in the language for years and is well specced.
