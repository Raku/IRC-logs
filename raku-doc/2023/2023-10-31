[16:13] <[Coke]> Sorry for the delay - please always feel free to ping me on PRs if it looks like I forgot. (I forgot)

[16:26] <[Coke]> any issues blocking us from doing a site publish in the next day or so? Grab the latest content and any site changes?

[19:51] <coleman> docs-dev looks good to me

[20:06] <[Coke]> pushing...

[20:09] <[Coke]> Done, but I think I might have needed to wait until the sitemap.xml changes were available in the queue?
