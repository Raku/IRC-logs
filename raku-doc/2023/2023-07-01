[18:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:

[18:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: RakuDoc::To::Text renders that as it should: "foo baz"

[18:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[18:37] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Not going to change Pod::To::Text, so just change the content here.

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Temporarily fix rendering of X<>

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Pod::To::Text renders C<X<>> as "X<>", which is incorrect

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: RakuDoc::To::Text renders C<X<>> as "", which is correct

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: However the desired result is X<>, and that should be specified as

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: C<V<X<>>> .  But that renders as V<X<>> in Pod::To::Text, so there

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: is no way to get monospaced X<> from both Pod:: and RakuDoc::.

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Change the markup to V<X<>>: this is rendered correctly by both,

[19:56] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: but loses the monospacedness.  Which is livable, I think.

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Pod::To::Text removes that (which I think is incorrect)

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: RakuDoc::To::Text does render that

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Removing the trailing whitespace fixes the difference, so let's

[20:02] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: go for that.

[20:09] *** rf joined
[20:09] <rf> coleman: Raku docs is down it seems, for me at least

[20:09] <coleman> looking

[20:10] <coleman> cannot repro... looking.

[20:10] <coleman> https://docs.raku.org/  ?

[20:11] <rf> Yeah getting a service timed out

[20:11] <[Coke]> it's hanging here.

[20:11] <lizmat> works for me so far

[20:11] <coleman> Can't reproduce, either. Is there "internet weather" happening?

[20:11] <rf> Yeah keeps timing out, must be a Canada thing (iirc you're in Toronto [Coke]?)

[20:12] <lizmat> well, there's the Twitter melt down

[20:12] <coleman> checking Cloudflare

[20:12] <lizmat> where they are DDOSing themselves

[20:12] <lizmat> it appears the Twitter App doesn't honour a 419 status properly

[20:12] <rf> Oof.

[20:13] <[Coke]> I'm near albany ny

[20:13] <lizmat> sorry, 429

[20:13] <[Coke]> The client and server don't support a common SSL protocol version or cipher suite. (if I try to hit the ip addresses directly)

[20:13] <lizmat> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429

[20:13] <rf> SSL errors :(

[20:13] <lizmat> so: Space Karen has decided to only allow 600 tweets / day

[20:14] <lizmat> so after your reached that, you're getting presumably a 429

[20:14] <[Coke]> can't view tweets sans account, either.

[20:14] <rf> Might be so called internet weather then.

[20:14] <lizmat> the Twitter App however doesn't honour 429 and immediately tries again

[20:15] <coleman> I'm looking for a CF status page.

[20:15] <rf> coleman: https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/

[20:15] <rf> Ah it just loaded for me

[20:15] <lizmat> so any Twitter user reaching their limit on the Twitter App starts DOSsing Twitter

[20:15] <rf> It took 80000ms though lol

[20:15] <[Coke]> https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/ ?

[20:16] <rf> lizmat: Re-write it in Raku for 100% uptime

[20:16] <lizmat> hehe

[20:16] <lizmat> the app needs updating

[20:16] <[Coke]> why is the site going through securepubads.com or whatever.

[20:16] <rf> Is our DNS poisoned?

[20:16] <[Coke]> securepubads.g.doubleclick.net

[20:17] <lizmat> that would be ...bad

[20:18] <rf> Gonna do a DNS dig on docs.raku.org

[20:18] <coleman> Everything seems normal to me

[20:18] <lizmat> for me as well

[20:18] <coleman> I am digging in. I will post if I see anything weird.

[20:19] <rf> coleman: What's the IP of the server that we should be hitting? Or is it cloudflare managed?

[20:19] *** sena_kun left
[20:19] <coleman> it's a hetzner LB w/ a cloudflare cert

[20:20] <coleman> the cert is "private"; your browser doesn't trust it

[20:20] <coleman> CF does

[20:20] <rf> Seems to be working now, super odd.

[20:20] <rf> Networking is so fun :^)

[20:23] <[Coke]> finally loaded for me, but on reload now hanging on www.google-analytics.com

[20:25] <coleman> rf: to answer your question, the site is proxied through cloudflare

[20:27] <[Coke]> guess my wierd hostname loads are cloudflare related. still insanely slow to load

[20:38] <coleman> let me know when you need a prod deploy; the one-click button still works

[21:42] <[Coke]> my load times are reasonable again
