[17:55] <coleman> I've asked Richard to create a dedicated issue for the design of a dedicated search service. Since I'm not doing all the coding it's hard for me to insist on one way or another, but I do want it to be thought through

[17:56] <coleman> And yea perhaps a fully-dynamic site or a fully-static site is what I'd really prefer, and not a half-implementation of both

[17:56] <coleman> We'll make it work

[17:56] <coleman> I just want to make sure we're really trying to optimize what he have already, though. Gotta fight for that perspective.

[18:41] <[Coke]> #1; let's aggressively cache the search data

[18:41] <[Coke]> #2; use a cache buster whenever we deploy a new version.

[18:43] <[Coke]> looks like #1 is already happening.

[18:44] <[Coke]> and even without it, it's under a second.
