[18:19] <[Coke]> lizmat: I have some changes to help those tests pass compilation, but "Format" doesn't exist in the recent release by default.

[18:20] <[Coke]> do I have to do something to activate it, or do we need HEAD?

[18:20] <lizmat> use v6.e.PREVIEW

[18:20] <lizmat> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW: say Format

[18:20] <lizmat> meh

[18:22] <[Coke]> Ah, it was the method definition that didn't have that already.

[18:24] <[Coke]> That's very hard to declare correctly, will skip the test on that one.

[18:24] <[Coke]> (use v6... requires :solo, which doesn't work great with :preamble or :method)

[18:25] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/1da61a755e

[18:25] <[Coke]> Thanks for the docs!

[18:26] <[Coke]> We can remove that skip once it's the default.

[18:36] <lizmat> Ack!

[18:39] <[Coke]> ?

[18:39] <lizmat> I mean: indeed  :-)

[18:40] <[Coke]> ah, thought it was the gross noise ack, and not the ACK ack.

[18:40] <lizmat> sOrry  :-)

[20:15] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke self-assigned xt/space-after-comma.rakutest failing https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4322

[20:20] <[Coke]> weird, getting failures in that test, duplicates, and aspell.t which were all doing fine I thought.

[20:20] <[Coke]> Wonder if it's related to the new version of rakudo I just installed or something else, or just really have missed those errors.

[20:20] * [Coke] will dig in this weekend.
