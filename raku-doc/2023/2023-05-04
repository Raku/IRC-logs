[13:55] <coleman> Got the call on my calendar

[14:00] <[Coke]> Second saturday, so 9 days out, yes?

[14:01] <[Coke]> jit.si working OK for people? we are small enough that we can zoom, also.

[14:01] <coleman> I like Jitsi a lot

[14:02] <[Coke]> ok. It's "fine" (but I do spend MUCH of my day on zoom, so I'm very used to it.)

[14:02] <[Coke]> May 13, 2023, noon eastern

[14:03] <coleman> haha :) I am running a rather esoteric and masochistic linux distro right now, and I needed to compile Zoom from source

[14:03] <[Coke]> oof

[14:03] <coleman> It took 4 hours

[14:03] <coleman> But i was very impressed that it worked the first time
