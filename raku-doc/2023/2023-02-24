[16:21] <coleman> [Coke] are you able to see this link? https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects/2106628

[16:26] <[Coke]> y

[16:26] <[Coke]> though they do a bad job of forgetting where you were going when you login in.

[16:26] <[Coke]> I had to click the link, login, get to main dashboard, re-click link

[16:34] <coleman> Thanks for confirming. Getting used to Hetzner.

[17:13] <coleman> The next hourly build might have the highlighter successfully installed

[17:14] <coleman> Richard merged a bugfix to the highlighter installation script and I ran it on our build env

[17:20] <[Coke]> Glad to hear it!

[17:34] <cfa> neat

[17:38] <[Coke]> added some date based milestones in doc-website; anything in cleanup should move to one of them; cleanup will go away and just be the backlog

[18:03] <coleman> We're getting there.

[18:05] <coleman> https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/5to6-nutshell.html#constant

[18:05] <coleman> Is it working?

[18:07] *** sena_kun joined
[18:10] <coleman> Thanks for the bugfix, cfa

[18:11] <coleman> I'm putting my foot down. NO MORE DEPENDENCIES!

[18:11] <coleman> Dependencies are the enemy :)

[18:16] <cfa> :)

[18:34] *** Altai-man joined
[18:35] <[Coke]> yes, highlighting is working

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/6e7b449a59

[19:05] <cfa> suggestion: add docs-dev.raku.org to the topic in here

[19:05] <cfa> also #raku-docs should be updated to point here

[19:28] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke assigned to finanalyst Issue Can't install raku/doc deps https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4211

[19:37] <[Coke]> tbrowder: many of those were related to the new page/script

[19:37] <[Coke]> Last failing test as a result of that is https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4212

[19:48] <cfa> is finanalyst ever on irc?

[19:48] <cfa> i had a (non-doc question/request)

[19:49] <cfa> er, misplaced ) 

[20:30] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke self-assigned Update links-not-links.t to not use pod-to-html https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4213

[21:02] <[Coke]> nope. He's pretty much email only

[21:03] <[Coke]> I've gotten half a dozen emails from him this week.

[21:04] <[Coke]> the new way of doing the links should hopefully avoid the old annoying byproduct that L<>'s had to be a single line long. (some weird restriction of the test, even if the linked text was very long and had spaces>

[21:23] <tbrowder> ref new table errors: noted, working on it. are vim lines a no-go now (i think so, but not sure)?

[22:24] *** Altai-man left
[22:49] <tbrowder> [Coke]: i have a new version of table creator which reads the HLL::Grammar.nqp file about ready to commit. Want to change table name at the same time?

[23:55] <[Coke]> no, that's fine.
