[16:07] <[Coke]> ok, that was weird - external drive that has my home dir on it got mounted as FOO 1 instead of FOO, and it presented at the OS level at first like I had upgraded the OS (ran me through the "hey, you have no home dir" routine.). 

[16:08] <[Coke]> Thought I was going to have to completely reinstall everything, glad I figured out the weird mount point issue
