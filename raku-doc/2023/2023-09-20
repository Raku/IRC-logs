[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: 

[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: - the category header could be displayed in one column but the first item in the category could be in the next column

[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: - items themselves are not broken between columns

[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: - the problem is fixed by making the category header a part of the first item, which requires a modification of the HTML and correspondingly tweaking the CSS a bit.

[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: - listf-styling.scss should have been deleted when it was renamed to `_listf-styling.scss`

[19:50] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/keep_first_item_with_header_in_indexes: patch will be visible soon on new-raku. Difference between old and new is that class listf-caption is now on a `<p>` not a `<div>`
