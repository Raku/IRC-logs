[12:17] <[Coke]> Util: sorry - we skipped a meeting, still doing well communicating with irc/github, so didn't plan on a regularly scheduled meeting going forward, but probably only removed the one from the list.

[12:17] <[Coke]> Util: thank you for showing up, good to see you again!

[12:17] <[Coke]> (well, see you on irc. :)

[12:18] <[Coke]> I 

[12:21] <lizmat> [Coke]: fwiw, I feel it's bad to skip a meeting before a rhythm has really been ingrained in all team members

[12:22] <lizmat> if there's one thing I learned from organizing Perl Monger meetings, it's regularity

[12:23] <[Coke]> I appreciate that. My intention was not to have them ongoing forever. But if folks find them useful, we can keep them.

[12:24] <lizmat> well, lacking any in person events, I think the online meetups have their value

[12:24] <[Coke]> (I thought we needed a kickstart to get everyone on the same page; and then we had a surprise new web site anyway)

[12:35] <lizmat> well, I think there's still a lot to do, is there not ?

[12:36] <lizmat> keeping momentum is also important I think

[15:37] <coleman> Call me old school, but I do think sub-team coordination would be assisted by a real email mailing list

[15:38] <coleman> That's not trivial, though. lizmat: what's been your experience w/ perl6/raku mailing lists in the past? don't we have some that are active?

[15:38] <coleman> Build is green now, btw

[15:39] <coleman> This should reflect the main branches: https://docs-dev.raku.org/

[15:39] <coleman> If not, something else is goofy

[15:41] <lizmat> re mailing list: you mean, with an archive and so ?

[15:42] <lizmat> the currently active user mailinglist is is still not renamed, and runs on the Perl NOC infra

[15:43] <coleman> An archive, yea. And generally powered by mailing list software with self-service sub/unsub and moderation features

[15:44] <coleman> I'm not saying we should try and implement that right now, because it's a lot of work. 

[15:44] <lizmat> indeed...  :-(

[15:45] <lizmat> fwiw, this channel *is* being logged

[15:45] <lizmat> and is searchable: https://irclogs.raku.org/raku-doc/live.html

[15:47] <coleman> Yes, that's true. And chat is a necessary community space, especially for new people. But it is also nice to have a place for long-form writing. It can encourage more coherent thinking (At least for me :) )

[15:47] <coleman> Anyways, we aren't lacking in communication right now. Richard emailed me a few times over the weekend and I pushed him to move that into GitHub issues so that others can see, comment, and help.

[15:52] <[Coke]> Thank you. I had been trying to do the same with him the last time he had a bunch of emails.

[15:57] <[Coke]> coleman: actually, asking *you* about setting up a mailing list was on my list. ... Is google groups still a thing?

[16:03] <coleman> Google groups is still a thing, but I don't think it serves us well over the long term

[16:04] <coleman> Mostly because my experience with how they do membership and permissions (in a corporate setting) has soured me on them. 

[16:04] <[Coke]> are their other hosted solutions we could consider? Or would we be better off self-hosting? (higher bar, which is why we piggybacked off the perl5 team at the beginning)

[16:05] <coleman> I'm sure there are hosted solutions. I'd love to find one that respects EU regulations and isn't just repackaged GNU mailman. :D

[16:06] <coleman> What's interesting about self-hosting is that a lot of venerable email software is perl. Mailing list software in Raku could be a "killer app"

[16:07] <[Coke]> Dogfooding is nice, but.

[16:07] <coleman> Exactly.

[16:08] <coleman> We don't need to make any moves right now, though. 

[16:08] <[Coke]> As with many things, I'm happy to use the p5 stuff and think of it as semi-dogfooding.

[16:09] <[Coke]> Right now, the closest thing we have is github discussions for long form convos, which I'm OK with.

[16:11] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: dc4c2f34f8 | (Richard Hainsworth)++ (committed using GitHub Web editor) | META6.json

[16:11] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: bump Collection version cf issue #236 (#237)

[16:11] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: 

[16:11] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: v0.4.6 contains reporting of the source being processed when a error occurs.

[16:11] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/commit/dc4c2f34f8

[16:12] <coleman> If we wanted to try another free thing, we could create a SourceHut mailing list. That's a "proper" mailing list and the company is based out of Amsterdam, I believe.

[16:13] <coleman> Worth a look. Not ideal, though.

[16:13] <coleman> I gotta go back to dayjob. Adios.
