[23:38] <rf> While i'm in this code would anyone be against me sprucing up the JavaScript

[23:38] <rf> It's fairly dated

[23:40] <coleman> Open an issue with some suggestions

[23:40] <coleman> sprucing up is ambiguous

[23:41] <coleman> I'd be against introducting SPA-style frameworks, but in favor of adopting vanilla JS where it can replace existing jQuery, etc.

[23:44] <rf> Basically just turning var to const, and using forEach inplace of imperative loops

[23:47] <coleman> var->const sounds find

[23:47] <coleman> fine

[23:48] <coleman> go for it; but perhaps submit separate PRs for the cleanup stuff

[23:48] <coleman> makes that sort of thing easier to review

[23:49] <rf> Yeah, Im just having a lot of trouble figuring out where I need to look for the stuff I am trying to fix

[23:51] <rf> Haven't worked in an older JS codebase in a long time :L
