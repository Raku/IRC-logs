[15:43] <coleman> Very strongly against taking over Ctrl+F 

[15:44] <coleman> Forward slash "/" is a more common choice. GitHub uses it for focusing search.

[15:51] <lizmat> that's very vim like, no?

[15:54] <coleman> I suppose you're right! My chief concern is making sure that we do not break the native browser Ctrl+F

[15:54] <lizmat> that's a point  :-)

[16:00] <patrickb> I fully agree not to kill the Browser native CTRL+F. / is a choice I have observed in other places as well.

[16:04] <coleman> patrickb: Would you mind saying so? https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/pull/298

[16:04] <coleman> I feel outnumbered at the moment. 

[16:04] <coleman> :)

[16:13] <coleman> [Coke] do you see a button in the upper right? https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/2696
