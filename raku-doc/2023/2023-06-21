[22:04] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: * Moves highlighting functionality from template dir to plugin

[22:04] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: This PR only moves functionality without changing anything else.

[22:04] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: But by putting it into a plugin, it makes it easier to change later.

[22:04] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/main: The template directory is part of an older design of Raku::Pod::Render that works but is being upgraded.
