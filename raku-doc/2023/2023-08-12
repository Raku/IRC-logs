[18:24] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_dangling_text: fixes issues #275 and #279

[18:24] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_dangling_text: 

[18:24] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_dangling_text: both issues stem from the same problem: text is included in a secondary file from a primary file from a level2 heading. But the section is terminated by a level1 heading, not a level2 heading. The fix is to look for leveln, n-1, n-2, n-3 headings. By specification of RakuDoc, only headings upto level 4 are distinguished.

[18:24] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/fix_dangling_text: The regex should be made more generic, perhpas by recursion on level, decrementing it to 0, but I don't know how.
