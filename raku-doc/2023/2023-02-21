[13:40] <Geth> ¦ doc: tbrowder++ created pull request #4207: Replace the 'Opener graphemes' table with 'Brackets'

[13:40] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4207

[13:47] <rf> .

[13:52] <tbrowder> can the test doc site be seen by the public without loogin in?

[13:53] <tbrowder> *logging

[14:06] <[Coke]> yes. neither finanlysts's version or the docs-dev version requires a login.

[14:06] <[Coke]> tbrowder: does that PR supersede the previous one?

[14:45] <tbrowder> hm, i have to look (i thinks so, but i don’t remember it being a PR, just an issue)

[14:48] <[Coke]> there's one to update the openers, and now a new one to replace it.

[14:48] <[Coke]> With the rename, are all the links (are there any links to it?) preserved?

[14:50] <[Coke]> coleman: we probably need some way to have an more immediate build on docs-dev, and then some way to approve (if we're fancy) before it goes live.

[14:50] <[Coke]> the link checker, for example, isn't a test right now, it's that site plugin, so if this PR breaks an existing link, we'd not easily see it until we were live.

[14:52] <tbrowder> yep, i want to close the other PR and replace the old table with the new one. hopefully that will fix the normalization problem. in any event, at least the correct and complete sets will be on display as source. after the dust settles, i will add my table-maker code to the site.

[14:53] <[Coke]> ok. Please open a ticket to add whatever script you have to the util/ folder so we don't lose the task.

[14:53] <tbrowder> wilco

[14:54] <[Coke]> We probably want to add "update generated pages" makefile task and regen after each release or so, whatever pages fall into this category.

[17:25] <coleman> [Coke]: affirmative. I can make the more immediate docs update happen.

[17:27] <coleman> For production deploy, I can give you a button to click or a curl script to run
