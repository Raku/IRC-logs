[21:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/secondary_refactor: 5976ad918b | finanalyst++ | Caddyfile

[21:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/secondary_refactor: Caddy file changes to map unicode routes to web pages.

[21:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/secondary_refactor: 

[21:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/secondary_refactor: The map directive is well documented. The prettyurls file is generated when the html are built. Essentially, secondary files are generated with human-readable characters, including `/` and unicode. These are hash encoded and mapped to files in the `hashed/` directory.

[21:40] <Geth> ¦ doc-website/secondary_refactor: The route directive was added after discussion with the Caddy maintainer. Basically, Caddy by default runs `try_files` before `error`, which generate errors for given routes. Since we want `/hashed*` routes to be illegal from the outside, `errors` must run before the `try_files` directive.
