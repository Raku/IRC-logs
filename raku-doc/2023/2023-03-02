[15:01] <lizmat> ok, so suppose I'd like to document the numeric coercers for Date/DateTime

[15:02] <lizmat> how would I indicate that these are only available since 2023.02

[15:10] <cfa> we have "available as of..." type notes in a few places, e.g.

[15:10] <cfa> https://docs.raku.org/type/Any#method_are

[15:10] <cfa> or for language version, https://docs.raku.org/type/Attribute#Trait_is_required

[15:11] <cfa> i'm not sure whether there's an agreed upon convention though

[15:17] <[Coke]> Right now, please add it directly in the text. We are still trying to figure out what the markup for it should look like.

[15:17] <[Coke]> SOmething like "Added in Rakudo compiler version 2023.02"

[15:19] <[Coke]> When we settle on the markup, I assume we'll be able to find all these by searching for YYYY.MM

[15:19] <lizmat> I'm not entirely sure when Date.daycount got added

[15:19] <lizmat> or that it existed from the beginning...  could be a 6.d addition

[15:19] <lizmat> it wasn't documented anyways

[15:30] <lizmat>     multi method DateTime(Date:D --> DateTime:D)

[15:30] <lizmat> isn't there an invocant : missing?  shouldn't that need to be:

[15:30] <lizmat> multi method DateTime(Date:U: --> DateTime:U)

[15:41] <[Coke]> lizmat++

[15:42] <[Coke]> regarding sigs: we want it to be as close as possible to the rakudo definitions (and have an optional test that is checking these), but really, this points to an issue where roast doesn't specify sigs, only behavior (usually)

[15:43] <[Coke]> so we're kind of cheating by comparing with rakudo.

[15:48] <[Coke]> the test (basically codesection's version now) is xt/check-signatures.rakutest

[15:49] <[Coke]> need to have a local checkout of rakudo with path in RAKUDO_SRC - At some point, I want it to be smarter -and- pass -and- get run each time. :)

[16:04] <lizmat> before I go: I guess we're going to create a new dir for the RakuAST:: classes
