[21:18] <NemokoschKiwi> hi hi

[21:21] <NemokoschKiwi> is it only me or the docs-dev site seems to have no opacity for the search?

[21:45] <NemokoschKiwi> added a comment for the "installable doc" issue, long story short: I think rakudoc should address that issue by retrieving the content from the doc repo, and not the doc repo by becoming a tool itself yet again

[21:50] <NemokoschKiwi> just like the website clones the content repo, I don't see why a similar principle couldn't work for rakudoc

[22:09] <NemokoschKiwi> That's not the main reason I came here, though - https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/184

[22:09] <NemokoschKiwi> rebased, updated the installation instructions, fixed the version pinnings...

[22:10] <NemokoschKiwi> I think rebases will be pretty simple for a while, as long as there are only "trivial" content modifications

[22:11] <NemokoschKiwi> anyway, I'm hoping to find somebody interested enough to try and run an instance
