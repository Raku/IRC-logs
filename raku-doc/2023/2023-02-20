[00:02] <[Coke]> cfa: please open a ticket, else finanalyst won't see it

[00:02] <[Coke]> good catch

[00:03] <cfa> ack

[00:06] <cfa> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/124

[00:11] <[Coke]> commented on the ticket, but it looks fine here:

[00:11] <[Coke]> https://docs-dev.raku.org/language/modules.html#use

[00:12] <[Coke]> ... oh, maybe because no formatting was done on that code.

[00:13] <cfa> ah, then it's the highlighter (which i only just got working locally :))

[00:14] <cfa> commented too

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-1: remove TM char for consistency

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-1: 

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-1: This addresses issue #119 in doc-website, was in Raku/doc

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-1: Either all references to Raku should have tm or none. My preference is for none as it is obvious

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc/finanalyst-patch-1: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/f03b281df7

[12:24] <Geth> ¦ doc: finanalyst++ created pull request #4205: remove TM char for consistency

[12:34] <[Coke]> ^^ O

[12:35] <[Coke]> ^^ I've pinged codesections (who has some legal experience & is working with The Raku Foundation) if we can drop down to just a single TM on the overview page.

[16:17] <cfa> hmm, the search results on the new doc site are at times unhelpful

[16:19] <cfa> for example, search for 'wantarray' -- you get 10 or so irrelevant antipair(s) matches before the actual matching heading

[16:19] * cfa checks issues

[16:34] <rf> The searchbar is brutal. Imo it should be reimplemented.

[16:35] <rf> Lot's of bugs and weirdness from it.

[17:38] <[Coke]> I think it has been 3x now. :)

[17:52] <cfa> 3x?

[18:11] *** sena_kun left

[20:27] <[Coke]> three times.

[20:29] <cfa> three references to search bar issues?

[20:30] <[Coke]> it's been rewritten three times.

[20:36] <cfa> ah, i see

[22:33] <NemokoschKiwi> I'm not sure what you mean. Sure, there have been patches but at its heart, it's still the jQuery-catcomplete plugin searchbar. CIAvash went ahead and switched to something working on the other site but that one wasn't taken over - I don't terribly mind we didn't settle on that one but we are back to the original problem: the catcomplete plugin is

[22:33] <NemokoschKiwi> broken and not worth fixing.

[22:37] <NemokoschKiwi> A different thing - it would be good to bring up the templating situation to finanalyst, how much considerations went into it. It's basically just ad-hoc string concatenation over shared data, it's really hard to read. Since I took over HTML::Tag anyway, which plays well with ad-hoc HTML generation, I think it might be worth a try; at least it

[22:37] <NemokoschKiwi> would get somewhat more readable and we definitely wouldn't have to worry about generating badly structured HTML

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi> Especially thinking of snippets like

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi> ```

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>             if $last-level eq 1 {

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>                 $rv ~= "</li></ul>\n"

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>             }

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>             else {

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>                 $rv ~= "</li></ul></li></ul>\n"

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi>             }

[22:39] <NemokoschKiwi> ```
