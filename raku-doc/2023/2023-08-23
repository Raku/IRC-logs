[23:38] <[Coke]> wonder if that should have failed a test

[23:47] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4347 seems important, given several of the recent "docs sucks" notes I've seen.

[23:48] <[Coke]> please let me know here if concerns.

[23:49] <[Coke]> I imagine a slight impact to the website tooling would be required if we move from docs to resources.

[23:49] <[Coke]> (which we could fix in advance by checking both dirs before we start using the second one)
