[11:44] <ab5tract> Has anyone ever tried generating a “docset” (format used by Dash and a few other doc readers) from the doc website?

[11:44] <ab5tract> I’ve been poking at the edges of doing so, but haven’t really made any progress yet

[12:16] <[Coke]> I don't think so. Might make sense to hook it into elucid8 as another output format.

[12:16] <[Coke]> (since that already understands how to combine the raw data)

[18:01] <coleman> ab5tract: not docset but parsing docs into a graph is demonstrated here https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2024/12/10/graph-neat-examples-in-raku-set-3/
