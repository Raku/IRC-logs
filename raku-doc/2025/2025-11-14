[15:19] <lizmat> weird rendering issue?   https://docs.raku.org/syntax/%24_  says: See primary documentation in context for The $ variable.

[15:20] <lizmat> note the absence of _ thre

[15:20] <lizmat> there

[15:20] <lizmat> the link is however correct

[15:20] <lizmat> How did the _ disappear?

[15:20] <[Coke]> I'm assuming that's a doc-website bug.

[15:22] <[Coke]> ugh. doc-website has Int.dot and int.dot files again. :(

[15:22] <lizmat> sorry to be the bringer of bad news :-(

[15:22] <[Coke]> thankfully I have a case senstivie filesystem lying about.

[15:23] <[Coke]> oh. it's using _ as a marker character, oops

[15:24] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/cd3f4a586c08009e3deeace52064bb1581949d0c/Website/plugins/secondaries/gen-secondaries.raku#L145-L149

[15:28] <[Coke]> guessing that and line https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/cd3f4a586c08009e3deeace52064bb1581949d0c/Website/plugins/secondaries/gen-secondaries.raku#L134

[15:29] <[Coke]> I'd pull out any refs to _ into a separator var and then set it to something more... unique?

[15:29] <lizmat> I guess...  perhaps §  ?   

[15:29] <[Coke]> oh, I already had a copy of doc-website in my case-sens. volume, so guessing I found this a year ago and forgot about it. :)

[15:31] *** arkiuat left
[15:35] <[Coke]> why does Pod::To::Markdown not have a command line tool?

[15:35] *** wayland76 left
[15:36] <[Coke]> ... ah, because it's easy enough to use raku

[15:36] *** wayland76 joined
[15:36] <lizmat> right raku is the commandline tool:   --doc=Markdown  right ?

[15:36] <[Coke]> yup. sadly it generates wildly different markdown that we have in doc-website.

[15:37] <[Coke]> (so my patch to the rakudoc can't easily update the markdown also.

[15:37] <lizmat> well, it's in raku community modules now, so knock yourself out  :-)

[15:40] <[Coke]> I mean, it should probably be --doc=md instead of (or in addition to) --doc=Markdown, but that's fine.

[15:41] <[Coke]> (need aliases, so it's not literally the name of the package only)

[18:41] <lizmat> looking at https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#$*CWD

[18:41] <lizmat> feels to me this is wrong for most people coming from other languages

[18:41] <lizmat> $*CWD is *not* the current working directory

[18:42] <lizmat> it's an IO::Path object that is supposed to contain the directory that *should* be considered to be the current working directory

[18:43] <lizmat> that just happens to be initialized with the OS's current working directory at startup

[19:02] <lizmat> also feels we should probably deprecate https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#$*EXECUTABLE-NAME
