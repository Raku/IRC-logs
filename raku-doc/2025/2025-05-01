[08:03] <wayland> Just wanted to ask again: Are we aware that our Google results have become significantly uglier in the last month or so, probably due to a robots.txt?

[10:42] <wayland> Also, when building the tests, I'm getting: Failed test 'doc/Language/distributions/introduction.rakudoc has inconsistent capitalised headings

[10:43] <wayland> Anyone know what that's about?

[13:12] <[Coke]> I'm only aware of it because you mentioned it

[13:12] <[Coke]> We don't have any kind of SEO tracking going on

[13:14] <[Coke]> Sometimes test failures sneak in from PRs. I typically fix them immediately in post but may have missed on.

[13:14] <[Coke]> (it has the british spelling? interesting)

[13:16] <[Coke]> our robots.txt is:

[13:16] <[Coke]> User-agent: *

[13:16] <[Coke]> Disallow: /

[13:16] <[Coke]> Yup, that's bad.

[13:19] <[Coke]> wayland: https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/441

[13:20] <[Coke]> Please feel free to add any more context. Wondering if it was added by devops to address a bad actor but overreached.

[13:21] <[Coke]> also, that test failure is in the extended tests, which we wouldn't consider "breaking the build" at this point.

[13:22] <[Coke]> ... also that test doesn't fail here.

[13:22] <[Coke]> Do you have a clean checkout? I'm on main at 044b4a01e

[22:15] <wayland76> [Coke]: Just to clarify my question, it's not a clean build; what I'm really asking is "What does it want me to change?", or "Where do I read about what it doesn't like?"
