[13:48] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: correct the explanation for how the 24 iterations come about

[13:48] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: 

[13:48] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: * Expand the iteration log (but for brevity keep only the relevant 2 lines per iteration; it should be transparent through the words and code that are above)

[13:48] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: * The current explanation for the number 24 is incorrect (based on a numerical coincidence; and where it says 'OUTPUT: «23␤»' the output is actually 22)

[13:48] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: * The correct explanation (as can be seen from the complete iteration log) is that 24 = 10 + 14 = (1+9)+(1+13), i.e. that first the 10 chars of " database!" get backtracked [down to 1, taking 10 trials total], and then the 13 chars of "SQL database!" get backtracked [down to 0, taking 14 trials total, with the last one a match]

[14:06] <[Coke]> OK, thanks.

[14:06] <[Coke]> in future, if you're doing a work in progress like that, mark it draft so I don't keep wondering if I can merge. :)

[14:09] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/eaebf476b4

[14:11] <ds7832> Yes, will do :)

[14:20] *** arkiuat joined
[16:05] <ds7832> Expect a bigger rewrite at the end of https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Understanding_backtracking : The lower half of the paragraph "Understanding backtracking" has apparently been constructed upon an error: After the words (Ctrl+F) "Consider the following slightly changed example:", the first capture group es removed from the regex, but the reference at the end, $1, which is supposed to contain "SQL", isn't adjusted to $0, as it'

[16:05] <ds7832> s necessary.

[16:06] <ds7832> changing it to $0 makes the match actually work:

[16:06] <ds7832> my $string = 'PostgreSQL is a SQL database!'; say $string ~~ / (SQL) (.+) $0 /;

[16:06] <ds7832> ... would produce: 

[16:06] <ds7832> ｢SQL is a SQL｣

[16:06] <ds7832>  0 => ｢SQL｣

[16:07] <ds7832>  1 => ｢ is a ｣

[16:08] <ds7832> The same mistake of using $1 rather than $0 has been carried through to the end, and most of the text is built around its results... So not sure how much of it can be kept. 

[16:09] <ds7832> I rthink the one main poin that remains, is that even with the :ratchet adverb, there can still be more than one iteration.

[16:23] <ds7832> I think what I'll do is talk about frugal quantifiers. Indeed much of what's going on there is effects of greedy quantifiers (or their absence), and it's very much worth knowing how one can influence backtracking by using frugal rather than greedy quantifiers.

[17:09] <[Coke]> good catch

[17:10] <[Coke]> I think a lot of the changes I have been making over the years are more targeted, nice to have a more holistic approach on a given page.

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: Correct extended backtracking example, making it about frugal quantifiers

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: 

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: In the current line "say $string ~~ / (SQL) (.+) $1 /; # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»",  positional capture group should have been $0 rather than $1.

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: 

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: Changing it to $0 actually makes most of the supposedly failing examples (a) work and (b) non-informative because of that.

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: 

[17:58] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-2: What's missing so far though is an illustration of frugal quantifiers in the context of backtracking/ratcheting, so I've introduced some. (The subsequent subsection is more about frugal _ratcheting_ and mentions frugal quantifiers only briefly.)

[18:13] <ds7832> I have a line of output (wrapped in =code :lang<text>) that actually should contain a trailing whitespace. Is there a way to say, pass the whitespace test?

[20:33] <[Coke]> not at the moment.

[20:33] <[Coke]> can you reconstruct the example so it doesn't need it?

[20:34] <[Coke]> If not, that test can fail, just leave a warning in the PR so I know

[20:34] <[Coke]> and I'll add a special case in the test to ignore it.
