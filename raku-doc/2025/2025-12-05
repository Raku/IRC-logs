[14:51] <arkiuat> is it possible submit a PR as squashed using the web editor? I guess not.

[14:52] <arkiuat> Anyway, xt/rakudoc-types.rakutest is complaining about a link that I didn't even modify, in doc/Language/variables.rakudoc

[14:52] <arkiuat>     # at xt/rakudoc-types.rakutest line 91\n    # Failed test 'L<Regex|/language/regexes> should be L<C<Regex>|/type/Regex>'

[14:53] <arkiuat> /language/regexes is an actual article that was the intended link target there; arbitrarily forcing that to link to the type definition instead seems wrong

[14:56] <arkiuat> the link in question is in the discussion of The C<$/> variable on line 1175 of the .rakudoc

[14:58] <arkiuat> would the test be quieted if we didn't titlecase the linktext there? i. e. change "Regex" to "regex"?  If so, that change seems worth making.
