[18:30] <arkiuat> no camelia over here, hmm

[18:35] <lizmat> m: say "foo"

[18:36] <lizmat> weird... I thought camelia frequented here as well

[18:38] <[Coke]> happy to have her, I think we were just a late addition, irc wise

[18:39] <arkiuat> I'm just asking over on #raku. Wanted camelia to demonstrate what I was talking about.

[19:34] <arkiuat> I screwed up PR 4696 while trying to put the second commit onto it. I don't think I can handle a triangular github workflow yet, but I can finish this project with more piecemeal edits submitted in the web interface

[19:35] <arkiuat> can the one good commit on PR 4696 be merged, given the state I've left things in?

[19:35] <arkiuat> It's not marked as draft anymore

[20:17] <[Coke]> I don't think merging the merge commit will be a problem.

[20:17] <[Coke]> I find that if I'm working on a PR, I usually want "rebase", not merge.

[20:17] <[Coke]> that replays my commits on top of the new starting poitn

[20:18] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: changing method to routine for any, all, one, none (#4696)

[20:18] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[20:18] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Also adding example usage for sub form, and signatures for sub form.

[20:18] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: (Currently only method form is shown.)

[20:18] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/a771b1e91e

[20:18] <[Coke]> That was just a regular squash and merge of the whole thing

[20:56] <arkiuat> thanks

[20:56] <arkiuat> glad it wasn't a problem

[21:11] <[Coke]> No worries, appreciate all the fixes.

[21:21] <arkiuat> so, the current doc says that method deepmap returns a list, but when I run the two examples in sub form, and call .^name against what they return, each example returns the same type it was given, an Array and a Hash respectively in this case

[21:21] <arkiuat> I think this is one of those cases in which we want to say that what it returns is an Iterable

[21:22] <arkiuat> just like all those methods that have been kind of half-changed from documented as returning Lists to documented as returning Seqs

[21:23] <arkiuat> as in [Coke]'s problem-solving PR https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/499

[21:27] <arkiuat> in fact, I'll add a comment to this effect to that issue before I move forward with this commit

[21:27] <arkiuat> Iterable is the most specific role that Array and Hash have in common

[21:37] <arkiuat> comment added

[21:38] <arkiuat> also, it would be easier to write this clearly if I just pretended that both forms of deepmap used &block for its Code argument (method uses &block, sub uses &op)

[21:39] <arkiuat> &reduce and method .reduce both use &with for its Code parameter

[21:39] <arkiuat> just for example

[21:42] <arkiuat> or I could follow the example of the reduce doc and just refer to it as "the argument", there we go

[22:14] <arkiuat> i'll do duckmap and nodemap separately. This was trickier than I expected.

[23:46] <[Coke]> (iterable) yup, makes sense
