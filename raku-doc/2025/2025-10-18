[15:58] <arkiuat> I'm going to move the entry for "sub item" from Any to Mu and merge it with the entry for Mu's method item, since the only type specified in item()'s signature is Mu

[15:59] <arkiuat> I caught that in reviewing class Any, so I'll try to finish that review (looking for things that affect Mu), and then I think the draft PR will be ready

[18:35] <ds7832> [Coke]: My most recent commit so far moves the two (consecutive) sections "Type captures" and "Positional vs. named arguments" up. Since that sort of floods the diff view, will it be easier to review things if I finish the PR up for now?

[18:37] <[Coke]> Sure.

[18:37] <[Coke]> I can review it shortly

[18:41] <ds7832> Alright, I think it's in fact ready for review; I've now marked it as such. (I still plan to write something on slurpies at the end of the intro section, but I'll add that through a future PR.)

[19:18] <[Coke]> or anyone, I just know lizmat knows how to do it. :)

[19:44] <arkiuat> PR 4668 is ready for review (and now I know where the "convert to draft" link is, thanks for that)

[19:44] <arkiuat> going through all the routines documented in class Any is always very distracting, but I didn't find any more like sub item that should have been in Mu instead
