[19:28] <[Coke]> added some comments on wayland76's PR, but didn't do a holistic readthrough. (and i suspect that a fraction of this PR is moving already written content around, yes? So you might get some comments about the original content as well as the new stuff

[23:07] <wayland76> [Coke]: do you mind if we keep this PR focussed on the existing changes, and not rewriting things that are just moving things around?  What I'm worried about is that this will again get pushed on to the back burner by one of us, and then there will be more moerge conflicts to overcome, and it could take ... a long time.  Really all I'm asking is permission to say "Let's not worry about that now" if it's sub-optimal, but a) pre-existing, and b) not 

[23:08] <wayland76> actually wrong.  

[23:16] <wayland76> ^^ I've put the same question on the ticket.  So you can ignore this.
