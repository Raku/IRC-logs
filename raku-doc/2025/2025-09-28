[00:00] <[Coke]> Thanks, folks

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: Further simplify `say` line of `is rw` example in Routine.rakudoc

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: Imo the change just made was a solid step in the right direction, but didn't go far enough.

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: I have saved a full rationale in a gist if whoever reads this (@coke?) doesn't agree that the output is still far too complex for good reference doc.

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: 

[00:45] <Geth> ¦ doc/raiph-patch-3: (As a tangent, the routine code in the example is also far too complex for good reference doc for `is rw`. But without reading some large swathe of the doc I wouldn't know whether there's a significant negative impact if we radically simplify that code. So I've focused for this PR on just improving further on the good direction @schultzdavid took the `say` part.)

[14:37] <[Coke]> ah, hi

[14:38] <[Coke]> FYI, that whitespace fix was on your PR, if you could test changes with util/test_modified.sh, that'd be great. saves me a few seconds. :)

[14:38] <[Coke]> thanks for the submittals.

[14:42] <ds7832> Ah nice, I'll see to get the testing tools set up :)
