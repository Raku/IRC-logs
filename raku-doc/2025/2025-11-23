[15:16] <arkiuat> would having the commit bit allow me to reopen https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3030 , or is that a different kind of permission?

[15:17] <arkiuat> the title of that closed issue is exactly correct as is: it got fixed once, but the fix no longer works and the original problem has returned

[15:25] <ds7832> Just tested it – it does allow you to do that :) Button at the bottom of the page

[15:26] <arkiuat> rright, but I don't have perms. The button is grayed out for me.
