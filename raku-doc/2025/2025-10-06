[22:30] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/d5363c168e

[22:56] <arkiuat> so we've got these four new adverbs to map (:flat :duck :node :deep) from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5713 that aren't documented yet

[22:57] <arkiuat> my inclination is to document :flat in https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_map and the other three in https://docs.raku.org/type/Any#routine_map because that's where their respective corresponding methods are documented

[22:57] <arkiuat> I'm going to need to find and study some more examples where adverbs are documented before I'm ready to file a PR for this; should I file a docs issue on it in the meantime?

[23:15] <[Coke]> If you want to proactively open one, sure. we also have a "checklist" for each release that goes through commits in the release and says "doc these"

[23:57] <arkiuat> I've also in the past been annoyed that routine map isn't all documented in just one place, and that's contributing to my indecision
