[00:14] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat++ created pull request #4659: in 2025.08, lizmat fixed the newly documented misbehavior of julian-date

[00:14] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4659

[00:15] <arkiuat> well I dove back into rakubrew, and the first thing I found out was that the recently documented behavior of julian-date and modified-julian-date has been fixed as of 2025.08, so I had to update the wording

[00:24] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat++ created pull request #4660: dropped modified from modified-julian-date

[00:24] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4660

[00:25] <arkiuat> and had to fix a typo in my own PR

[14:04] <arkiuat> [Coke], I made a mistake in the first PR (dropped a word), and the second PR corrects the mistake in the first one. So both, yes.

[14:05] <arkiuat> If there's a better way to correct a PR once submitted, I'd appreciate a pointer.

[14:11] <arkiuat> added a comment to PR 4660

[14:14] <arkiuat> never mind, I just found another mistake. I'll close both PRs are resubmit a single new one.

[14:21] <ds7832> arkiuat: What I do when my PRs need fixing, is just make another commit to the same patch branch (which is linked to at the top of the PR).

[14:22] <ds7832> The PR will then automatically comprise that additional commit. Also the tests run again, automatically .

[14:29] <arkiuat> ds7832, you do this using the web editor on github's site?

[14:30] <ds7832> mostly on the webeditor, but I intend shifting my workflow to using git locally

[14:30] <arkiuat> I've been making my edits on a local fork on my own machine, pushing the to my fork on github, and submitting from there.

[14:30] <arkiuat> Okay, that's a good tip, thank you!

[14:31] <ds7832> I'm very certain that it works just as well with push from local. I think I already did that once or twice

[14:32] <arkiuat> I just started using branches at all about a month ago, I think?

[14:32] <ds7832> (Most cumbersome about fixing through web interface is, I haven't found any quick link directly to edit a file from the commit)

[14:32] <arkiuat> Right, that makes sense.

[14:33] <arkiuat> I earned my living with Perl for many years, but then was out of tech and in a different field starting right around the time everyone began using git. So I'm a total newb at that aspect

[14:33] <ds7832> Yeah, I'm also not that versed with it yet. ^^ I should read "man 7 gittutorial" again, that's good intro for branches

[14:34] <arkiuat> another good tip!
