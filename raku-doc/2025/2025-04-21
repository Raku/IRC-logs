[15:46] <tbrowder> coleman: have you found a good how-to for creating such a thing? github docs to me are a nightmare of circular links

[16:07] <coleman> tbrowder: the official GitHub documentation about creating an App is comprehensive 

[16:07] <coleman> it is a LOT to read

[16:07] <coleman> but it is all there. it's a heavily used system, so it's well documented 

[16:08] <coleman> start here https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps

[16:52] <tbrowder> yes to “‘LOT’ to read”…

[16:58] <tbrowder> hm, maybe ask ChatGPT

[17:01] <tbrowder> if finanalyst is having trbl, no way i can do it w/o help. based on my recent experience with chatgpt, it’s excellent at collecting such pieces

[23:57] <tbrowder> coleman: chatgpt really helps with github help

[23:57] <tbrowder> for the github app
