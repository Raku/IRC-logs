[17:37] <arkiuat> not sure where to report this, because it could be fixed in either of raku.org or docs.raku.org, but the "useful resources" link toward the bottom of https://docs.raku.org/language/intro is now a deadlink

[17:38] <arkiuat> It links to raku.org/resources

[17:45] <arkiuat> and the content of raku.org/resources got split up over two or three pages in the new site redesign. A quick fix would be to link to old.raku.org/resources: would that be legit?

[22:09] <[Coke]> Report it on raku.org please, that's steve's fault. :)

[22:09] <[Coke]> No, do not link to the old site

[22:09] <[Coke]> Fix the links on the new site.

[22:09] <[Coke]> (and in the meantime, change the links elsewhere to point to the temporary URLs.

[22:10] <[Coke]> but preferentially fix the new site

[22:50] <arkiuat> thanks

[23:13] <arkiuat> raku.org issue #261
