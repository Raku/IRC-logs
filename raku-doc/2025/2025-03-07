[20:47] <wayland76> Question: If I wrote up a document on how to make a Slang, would we be interested in including it?  Maybe in the Tutorials section?  

[21:11] <lizmat> definitely  :-)

[21:16] <wayland76> Great!

[22:18] <Geth> ¦ doc: wayland++ created pull request #4564: Added initial revision of Slangs tutorial

[22:18] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4564

[22:19] <wayland76> There we go.  It's not much yet, but it's better than nothing, and it's the best I can do with my knowledge.  

[22:20] <wayland76> I'd particularly like someone to check the links to the main Raku grammar and ensure that they're the places I'm supposed to link to.  I pulled those links out of the IRC logs from 2021, so they may no longer be accurate.  

[22:29] <wayland76> Also, I think I have a bug to report.  When I visit https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Sigils in Firefox, the heading I linked doesn't have any content; there's a box where the heading should be, but nothing visible in it.
