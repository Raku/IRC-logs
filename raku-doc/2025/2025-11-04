[12:51] <[Coke]> guessing someone did some nasty crawling with Cro and they soft-blocked that useragent.

[12:53] <lizmat> does changing the user agent help ?

[12:53] <lizmat> otoh, I think WP is protecting itself more aggressively against scrapers in general

[12:57] <[Coke]> Yes, changed it to something like 'raku docs validator', no 429s

[12:57] <[Coke]> now back to just getting them on raku.land. :)

[12:58] <[Coke]> updating the sleep between 429s to at least 5, no more than 42s.

[15:01] <[Coke]> would be nice if we queued up all the https tests, sorted them by hostname, and ran multiple threads at once.

[15:01] <[Coke]> (so that we could have one thread blocking on 429s from github or whatever, while all the one offs can fire off one right after the other
