[11:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-5: 

[11:23] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-5: The remark that «» quotes are "also a valid quoting construct in Raku" is more confusing here, since the quoting construct semantics are very different from how they're used in "OUTPUT: «...»" comments.

[11:34] <Geth> ¦ doc/schultzdavid-patch-6: From the previous wording, a new reader would likely suspect that `«»` quotes in Raku code to behave similarly to the `«»` in `"OUTPUT: «»` comments, i.e. do nothing.

[19:25] <lizmat> hmmm   https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_~~   feels wrong to me

[19:25] <lizmat> afaik, infix ~~ does **not** topicalize

[19:26] <lizmat> $a ~~ $b    is merely short for   $b.ACCEPTS($a)

[19:31] *** arkiuat joined
[19:33] <[Coke]> that's been there since at least 2018

[19:35] <lizmat> could be    and maybe it once was specced that way, but if I look at the implementation, there's no topicalization involved afaics

[19:36] *** arkiuat left
[19:39] <lizmat> also, it appears that ⩵   ( 2A75 TWO CONSECUTIVE EQUALS SIGNS ⩵)  is missing as an alternative to ==   in  https://docs.raku.org/language/unicode_ascii

[19:40] <[Coke]> been that way since 2012 when moritz added it.

[19:40] <[Coke]> (the $__

[19:40] <[Coke]> )

[19:41] <lizmat> I wonder how we could check

[19:42] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke assigned to schultzdavid Issue Minor issues https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4709

[19:42] <lizmat> hmmm...perhaps the ~~ dispatcher does something quirky
