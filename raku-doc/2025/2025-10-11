[01:44] <arkiuat> I also had some remnants of an old rakubrew install, so I had to uninstall and reinstall Readline to get it looked for in the right place. Gonna read the zef help to see if there's an easy way to do this for everything

[01:45] <[Coke]> nuke?

[01:45] <[Coke]> you can tell zef to nuke the install dirs (and that takes out everything)

[01:50] <arkiuat> yeah, I was hesitating over how to supply the correct "configuration path or CURLI name"

[01:50] <arkiuat> it does the right thing if I just say "zef nuke" with no args?

[01:54] <arkiuat> zef list --installed mentions exactly two dirs, which may well be the bad old one and the good new one respectively

[01:56] <arkiuat> nope, the only thing installed in the one of the two dirs is rakudo:ver, and every other module is in the other dir

[01:57] <arkiuat> and it was clearly put there by MacPorts, not zef

[02:10] <arkiuat> found it on raku.land "zef nuke site home"

[02:15] <arkiuat> but yikes! that wants to delete my rakudo-history file as well. I'll just copy that out of the way first

[12:33] <[Coke]> ... ok, was looking up to just verify that was camel. one of the suggested translations was "oont", so I looked that up... english for "a camel, especially an attractive camel"

[12:33] <[Coke]> language, sheesh.

[12:40] <ds7832> oh wow, haha.

[12:41] <[Coke]> so how are you picking what to work on? Large number of updates, wide variety

[12:41] <[Coke]> You should also add yourself to CREDITS

[12:42] <ds7832> Basically I there's always one priority doc I work through to the end, usually from /language

[12:43] <ds7832> then when I feel like I should up on this referenced topic, I go there and sometimes (frequently) trail off

[12:44] <ds7832> read up*

[12:46] <ds7832> e.g. currently I'm going through /language/regexes. There I read "pragma" mentioned again and felt like it's time to read up on what exactly that is. Kept reading about the Monkey things too because I already had them on my radar.

[12:48] <ds7832> adding to CREDITS – ah very cool, I'll do that, thanks

[12:50] <ds7832> ... so pretty much all of what I edit is just what I notice while reading the docs to learn (or what I then also notice during that editing)

[12:57] <[Coke]> ds7832++

[12:58] <[Coke]> While I would still like things to go through PRs... would it be easier if you had a commit bit?

[12:59] *** arkiuat left
[13:04] <ds7832> So I keep preparing the commits on my forks, then create a PR and (in case I'm certain that the changes are correct) merge it myself? Okay, that would be nice

[15:55] <[Coke]> I was thinking you could prep the PRs in a branch off raku/doc, create a PR, then still have someone review & apply.

[15:55] <[Coke]> but then you don't have to keep merging yours to stay up to date, etc.

[22:21] <arkiuat> finally got util/test-modified.sh running cleanly after the nuke all and reinstall, except for "dot:from<bin>" whatever that is, which seems to be needed only for Doc::TypeGraph, and except for the fact that it does complain about rakudo 2025.05 not being 2025.08

[22:21] <arkiuat> so perhaps i'll have to reconcile myself with rakubrew after all

[22:47] *** ds7823 left
[22:51] <[Coke]> dot is a command line program used by graphviz.

[22:52] <[Coke]> ... We used to generate the class diagrams in this repo, we don't anymore. You can see if we're still using that module anywhere.

[23:05] *** ds7832 left
[23:44] <arkiuat> perhaps I will do that sometime, but for now I've installed Doc::TypeGraph with  --exclude="dot" --force-test

[23:44] <arkiuat> I'll start over clean again if/when I switch to from macports to rakubrew

[23:57] <[Coke]> sure, no worries.
