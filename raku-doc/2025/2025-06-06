[11:17] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Closes #4541

[11:17] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/982954b022

[11:32] * [Coke] ponders splitting the docs into separate raku versions going forward (so with 6.e we'd have "original", and "6.e", with any new release getting its own version)

[11:32] <[Coke]> I know this has been discussed before and I was against it, but imagine this *would* be better for users, esp. with trying to "clean things up" for a 6.e release.
