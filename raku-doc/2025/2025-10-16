[12:53] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[12:53] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Currently there's no substitution example involving balancing delimiters (brackets etc.) and operating on a named string variable.

[16:08] <arkiuat> I'm tempted to take on https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4560 , which I just left a comment on

[16:13] <arkiuat> just wondering how much testing/checking I'm going to need to do to make the docs accurate about this and not just internally consistent; first level would be just calling the sub and calling the method and seeing if either errors out, second level would be checking against tests in roast

[16:24] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke assigned to arkiuat Issue heading 'routine' definition 'method' https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4560

[16:24] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke self-unassigned heading 'routine' definition 'method' https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4560

[16:25] <[Coke]> arkiuat: replied to your comment and assigned you to the ticket.

[16:36] <arkiuat> thanks!

[16:42] <[Coke]> hey, thanks for taking a stab at this one

[17:10] <arkiuat> is the signature test you referred to in xt/check-signatures.rakutest ?

[17:11] <arkiuat> I'm taking a look at that now

[17:16] <arkiuat> yep, this sure looks like it

[17:38] <arkiuat> yeah, lots of SKIPs. and it's clearly not detecting all the kind of issues I was talking about in my comment

[18:53] <arkiuat> okay, the first tricky bit I hit are a couple of links that I think my changes will break

[18:54] <arkiuat> L<C<isa>|/routine/isa#(Mu)_routine_isa> and L<C<does>|/routine/does#(Mu)_routine_does> 

[18:55] <arkiuat> util/test-modified.sh alerted me to this, so I'm going to try changing all four instances of "routine" in those two links to "method" and see what test-modified thinks of the result

[19:14] <arkiuat> test-modified.sh still says I broke the links

[19:14] <arkiuat> and the same issue in the opposite direction with the link to L<C<return>|/type/Mu#method_return> in return-rw

[19:23] <arkiuat> the original links here go to composite search results and not to a definite page, so I'm guessing that my new links will do similar?

[19:24] <arkiuat> I'll make a note on the issue and submit this first PR as is, because other than the issue with the three links, it's the low-hanging fruit.  I haven't tried to merge the two C<take> and the two C<defined> sections yet
