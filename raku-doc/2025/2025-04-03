[13:14] <finanalyst> [Coke] would you please try to access https://finanalyst.org/REPL.html

[13:15] <finanalyst> It is the same file but directly behind Apache. Only one file. The editor works on my Android now

[13:57] <[Coke]> Ok, you're pinging me in *three* places on this now. :)

[13:57] <[Coke]> Tested, responded.

[14:02] <finanalyst> [Coke] Sorry. Where is best to contact you?

[14:04] <finanalyst> [Coke] I need some help about how to find this error. 

[14:42] <[Coke]> any one is fine. pinging me simultaneously in 2 channels and on the ticket is a lot?

[14:46] <[Coke]> sounds like you need some way to test your JS across multiple browsers.

[15:02] <finanalyst> [Coke] truly sorry. I was so glad I got the editor working, then utterly frustrated for it to fail with you, then flumoxed as to why the same file works/does not work inconsistently

[15:02] <finanalyst> The multiple pings were my frustration. 

[15:04] <finanalyst> I wish I knew where / who to ask for help. Its not Raku and seems to be somewhere between Android/Mac Apache or Caddy

[15:15] <[Coke]> finanalyst: no worries, I figured that's what it was. Certainly in the past I haven't responded quickly.

[15:15] <finanalyst> replying to issue

[15:15] <[Coke]> if we needed to test on windows/linux, I could easily spin up something in azure for you to run the test on.

[15:17] <finanalyst> at present I have the same error you reported when trying to access new-raku on an Android, and no issue when accessing the single file on finanalyst,org

[15:17] <[Coke]> something like browsertack.com looks good, but the pricing is high unless you're using it all the time.

[15:18] <finanalyst> What device / OS are you using?

[15:18] <[Coke]> finanalyst: (same error) - ok. any failures to load a component, console errors, etc.?

[15:18] <finanalyst> On Android on mobile, I havent been able to access errors yet.

[15:19] <[Coke]> macOS 14.6.1, M2 chip, chrome and firefox latest.

[15:19] <finanalyst> I'm setting up the USB debugging options

[15:19] <[Coke]> You have time right now for a screen share?

[15:19] <finanalyst> Yes free

[15:20] <finanalyst> Connect on Jitsi?

[15:20] <[Coke]> zoom OK?

[15:21] <finanalyst> Zoom fine

[15:21] <finanalyst> better

[15:21] <[Coke]> see privmsg

[15:50] <[Coke]> ok, we have a potential cause for the issue, finanalyst will investigate.
