[16:48] <arkiuat> I think I'm going to take a break from docs issue #4560 for a bit and do something to address #3881. That's right up my alley and has been languishing for over four years

[16:53] <lizmat> ++arkiuat 

[17:12] <arkiuat> the hardest part, for me, is going to be cutting the explanation down to the bare minimum required. I think that's what's appropriate here, and I can chatter on about leap seconds all day long, so what looks like the bare minimum to me is probably going to seem like a little too much to most folks

[17:54] <[Coke]> arkiuat++

[17:54] <[Coke]> I responded to raiph's comment.

[17:54] <[Coke]> I find that he has VERY large comments that can hang people up, so trying to give a followup allowing us to proceed.

[18:04] <arkiuat> I added a commit reversing the mistaken commit to Mu.rakudoc, so the PR should be okay now

[18:05] <arkiuat> and thanks for assigning that issue

[18:42] <arkiuat> oops

[18:46] <arkiuat> there we go; that may well do as an example

[19:10] <arkiuat> I wonder if it would be possible to get a variance allowing actual linebreaks in the output instead of ␤

[19:11] <arkiuat> that would make things a lot clearer. And I think I can get by with only four lines of output, not the six shown here

[20:29] <arkiuat> okay, now I'm looking at the phrase "UNIX timestamp"; I originally changed it to POSIX timestamp to be pedantically correct, except that everyone calls it Unix time. (There's a place for referring to it as POSIX time, and this isn't that place: we're in DateTime, not Instant).

[20:30] <arkiuat> Howevever, now the all-caps UNIX is really bugging me, so I'm changing it to "Unix timestamp" here.

[21:19] <arkiuat> so I'm making a couple of small additions to DateTime.rakudoc, but the big lump explaining leap seconds is going to be inserted into Instant.rakudoc before the current =head1 Future Leap Seconds. Here is a first draft of that https://gist.github.com/arkiuat/f4baa44430034ffc512fb4414242e483

[21:19] <arkiuat> I think this is too long, but I have no idea which parts should get cut: suggestions solicited.

[21:26] <[Coke]> the NL vs actual newlines has to be a separate discussion. :)

[21:26] <arkiuat> yes, okay, I'm fine with that

[21:26] <arkiuat> right now, I'm just asking about verbiage

[21:26] <[Coke]> I think whatever we decide on, we want consistency. I think we might want to go so far as having separate code blocks for output that are colored differently

[21:27] <[Coke]> reviewing draft...

[21:28] <[Coke]> It reads fine; I am only reading for style not accuracy. :)

[21:29] <arkiuat> That's good, because I'm confident about the accuracy but full of misgivings about the style

[21:30] <[Coke]> a few nits: "and which by that time" you can remove that which (it's repetitive)

[21:32] <arkiuat> good point. removed.

[21:32] <[Coke]> Instant should be a L<C<> nesting

[21:33] <arkiuat> I cut more than just from that spot, I think it works better

[21:34] <arkiuat> well, yes to the C<> but I'm planning to put this text on the page that the L<> would link to, so...

[21:34] <[Coke]> oh, then just C<>

[21:34] <[Coke]> the test is smart enough for that.

[21:35] <[Coke]> Sorry, didn't realize.

[21:35] <[Coke]> cool

[21:41] <arkiuat> I put a link to the gist in a comment on issue #3881, soliciting further suggestions for cuts. Now I'm to step away from the keyboard for a bit. Thanks for your suggestions!

[22:58] <arkiuat> m: for 30, 31 { say DateTime.new(2016,12,$_,12,0,0).day-fraction }

[22:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 04a36dd13: OUTPUT: «0.5␤0.499994␤»

[22:59] <arkiuat> that probably warrants adding a remark to DateTime.day-fraction also
