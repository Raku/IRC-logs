[14:23] * lizmat just notes there's no documentation for the PromiseStatus enum

[14:24] <lizmat> apart from the start of https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise

[14:27] <Geth> Â¦ doc: coke self-assigned PromiseStatus https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4604

[14:29] <lizmat> same for FileChangeEvent enum, in https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Notification

[14:29] <lizmat> [Coke]: thanks!

[14:38] <[Coke]> added

[18:50] <[Coke]> I should clarify - added the second one to the ticket, not yet added to the docs!

[22:05] <Voldenet> btw, it would be nice if Promise didn't have to operate on .status field normally

[22:05] <Voldenet> m: Promise.kept(42) ~~ PromiseStatus::Kept

[22:05] <Voldenet> oh, wrong channel

[22:05] <Voldenet> I'll write it in #raku instead
