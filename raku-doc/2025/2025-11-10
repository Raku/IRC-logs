[19:47] * lizmat is starting to wonder why these are separate entries: https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_=_(list_assignment) and https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_=_(item_assignment)

[19:47] <lizmat> and https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Item_and_list_assignment

[19:48] <lizmat> feels unnecessarily confusing and convoluted to me

[19:55] <lizmat> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_,     actually feels incorrect to me

[19:55] <lizmat> comma's create a List, how that list gets interpreted, is really upto the left hand side of the = sign
