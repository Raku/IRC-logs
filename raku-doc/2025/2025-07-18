[10:26] <wayland> Does anyone know if the Raku guide has any kind of indexing?  

[10:27] <lizmat> you mean, a table of contents ?

[12:03] <wayland> No, like an index.  

[12:03] <wayland> I didn't see one.  

[12:04] <wayland> Also, regarding the Documentation (separate from the guide), -- Rakudoc allows the embedding of index entries into the documents, and I believe this has been done with the Docs website.  I note that each document has a sidebar for the "Index", next to the Table of Contents, but is there a page that's an index for the whole of the Raku documentation?  

[12:10] <lizmat> ok, so you're not talking about https://raku.guide ?

[17:17] <[Coke]> composite is parts of other source pages put together. primary is the 'original' page directly rendered. I would have to look up if basic and fundamental have a meanig, do you have pointers to that?

[18:39] <arkiuat> so I was about to try using the edit button on the web docs to submit a pull request, but just to run it past folks here first: 

[18:39] <arkiuat> https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Special_variables has a few deadlinks to to [Distribution::Resources](https://docs.raku.org/type/Distribution/Resources)

[18:40] <arkiuat> It seems that the module in question is now called Distribution::Resource, singular not plural, and can be linked that way. Seems a straightforward fix to the docs. Makes sense?

[18:43] <arkiuat> actually, it's just one deadlink, but four occurences in the document of the string "Distribution::Resources" that should be changed to "Distribution::Resource"

[18:46] <[Coke]> yup, seems a simple fix, please submit the edit!

[18:47] <[Coke]> also check for the wrong text anywhere on the site at the same time?

[18:48] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat++ created pull request #4614: Update variables.rakudoc

[18:48] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4614

[18:50] <arkiuat> I had been trying to learn how to use branches properly so I could do this stuff at the CLI, but just discovered that edit button, which doesn't require me to fully understand how to create and change branches. Pretty convenient!

[18:52] <arkiuat> [Coke], I did check for other occurrences and didn't find any than those four

[18:53] <[Coke]> +1

[18:57] <arkiuat> wayland: I too have also wondered about the "index" link next to the "table of contents" link on every doco page. When I click through, those indexes are not sorted, but follow the same structure as the ToC, so not very usable as is

[22:00] <wayland76> lizmat: The first question about indexing was about the guide.  The second question, about embedded index entries, was about the documentation.  

[22:02] <wayland76> [Coke]: My main source for all this is something like: for i in `find doc/ -name '*.rakudoc'`; do head -1 ; done

[22:03] <wayland76> And then I just used raku to sort through eg. the categories.  

[22:03] <wayland76> I ran some numbers on them.  

[22:06] <wayland76> For the record, in the source for the docs, there are 37 pages marked "composite", and 0 pages marked "primary".  But now that I know the purpose, that helps me with my new categorisation system (I'm writing up some ideas -- will eventually submit them for review, but at the moment they're too piecemeal).  

[22:25] <wayland76> [Coke]: If it helps, the "fundamental" category has nearly 100% overlap with the Language>language Kind/subkind

[22:37] <[Coke]> wayland76: those categories have grown organically over the years and if you don't see them in writing-docs/ they aren't enforced.

[22:41] <wayland76> Thanks!  I think I've got my answer then :) 

[22:44] <wayland76> Another question: Do the files at https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/tree/main/Website/structure-sources appear on the website somewhere, or do I need to just either read the rakudoc, or build my own?  

[22:50] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/404missing

[22:51] <[Coke]> or any other missing page - those are used in the site, but there's no a to be listing there

[22:53] <[Coke]> "a to b"

[22:54] <[Coke]> https://docs.raku.org/miscellaneous is another one, for example.

[22:56] <[Coke]> ah, that said, there's your main mapping

[23:22] <wayland76> arkiuat: Branches are worth learning.  Basic process for github repos is a) fork the repo, b) Make a new branch in your copy of the repo, c) edit as desired, d) submit pull request from your new branch to the original repo.  HTH,

[23:27] <wayland76> I was hoping the "index" one would be about indexing, but on closer examination, it isn't.  

[23:28] <wayland76> I'm looking for the code that deals with the indexing.  

[23:29] <wayland76> Anyway, I'll pull down a copy and use grep :)

[23:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Update variables.rakudoc (#4614)

[23:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main:

[23:44] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/e3d5dfd789

[23:58] <arkiuat> wayland76: yep, and I have been practicing. Just not quite fully sure of myself yet so having the edit button as a crutch is helpful

[23:59] <arkiuat> it's v easy to make mistakes at the CLI that leaves things in a state that's difficult (for me, still at this point) to figure out
