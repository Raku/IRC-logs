[23:05] <wayland76> I've noticed that some docs are categorised "basic", and some "fundamental".  Any chance someone could explain the difference?  Links appreciated if available.  And if the answer is "there's no difference, it's just not well categorised", that's fine too :) 

[23:07] <wayland76> (also, an explanation of "composite" would be handy too)
