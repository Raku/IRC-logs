[09:53] <wayland76> Also, I'm working on a redesign of the kind/subkind/category classification (which doesn't seem to be documented anywhere I could find); I'm also including the categories at https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/writing-docs/INDEXING.md.  I'm thinking it might be my blog article this week.  

[09:54] <wayland76> (or the week after)

[10:33] <wayland76> I could be wrong, but I've just had a look at the "Indexing Terms" section of https://docs.raku.org/language/pod#Indexing_terms and it looks like the examples have weird formatting.  

[10:34] <wayland76> ÿÿ<strong>ÿÿX<array>ÿÿ</strong>ÿÿ

[10:34] <wayland76> That's what I'm seeing.  

[10:34] <lizmat> that feels like some mojibake ?

[10:34] <wayland76> The y-umlaut characters probably aren't supposed to be there.  

[10:35] <wayland76> I don't know what mojibake is.  Do I need to report a bug?  

[10:35] <lizmat> probably should make a doc issue for it

[10:36] <wayland76> Oh!  Thanks :) .
