[11:02] <wayland> Just wanted to note that I've just pulled down the latest Pod::To::HTML and, while it looks great, I noted a few problems: a) Links inside tables seem to be broken, b) The Table of Contents on the left is fine, but the text starts on the right of it, then flows down below it (Firefox), and c) there's a Raku logo in the top left corner.  Not sure if we want that or not.  

[11:03] <wayland> Just tested -- B<> also fails in tables.  

[11:03] <lizmat> yeah,.. it's a bit of a mess...  

[11:03] <lizmat> I was actually just looking at it

[11:05] <lizmat> I'm not sure yet why it depends on Template::Mustache, for instance

[11:07] <lizmat> it also depends on Pod::Load, and that's going to be obsoletish in the RakuAST world

[11:08] <lizmat> :q

[11:13] <wayland> Two steps forward, one step back :( .  Oh well, at least we're taking steps :) 

[11:14] <lizmat> also, the actual template used feels like it could also be done with a few simple .subst()

[11:15] <lizmat> so I'm considering overhauling Pod::To::HTML, because Pod::To::Markdown depends on it, and that needs overhauling as well  :-(

[11:15] <wayland> Ouch!  :) 

[11:16] <lizmat> yeah, I already got sucked into overhauling Test::Output yesterday  :-)

[11:17] <lizmat> fortunately, Pod::To::HTML has quite an extensive test-suite

[11:18] <wayland> Oh, nice!  

[11:18] <wayland> I noticed that the page for tables actually documents "Formatting blocks in table cells are currently ignored and treated as plain text."

[11:20] <wayland> Also, one more feature that I've seen other places (certainly Wikipedia tables, maybe Markdown?) is that you can put multiple columns on different lines.  That'd be handy for cases where you have a long link in a column; it may not show up as much in the output, but the link is long, so the source is more readable if the column can start on another line.  

[11:22] <lizmat> you might want to look at what RakuDoc has in store: https://raku.github.io/rakudoc#Procedural_description_of_tables

[11:22] <wayland> Should those be logged as bugs in rakudo, or Pod::To::HTML, or what?

[11:26] <lizmat> good question: I also wonder if all work on this should be spent on RakuDoc::To::HTML

[11:26] <wayland> Oh!  Yeah, I should use that instead.  

[11:27] <wayland> Yeah, much better.  I just tried it, and it resolved the bugs

[11:28] <wayland> Not as aesthetically pleasing, but much more functional.  

[11:28] <lizmat> the old visual table format is also still there

[11:28] <lizmat> if you like that better and the table is simple

[11:31] <wayland> Well, links inside tables work, and that's what was bothering me the most :) .  

[11:32] <wayland> But I mean, I switched from --doc to --rakudoc, and things in tables started working, so I'm happy :) 

[11:32] <lizmat> glad to hear  :-)
