[15:04] <arkiuat> I don't think I have the ability to self-assign an issue, but if y'all want to assign https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4395 to me, I seem to have already started working on it.

[15:20] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke assigned to arkiuat Issue @-sigiled options are not documented for `sub MAIN` https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4395

[15:20] <[Coke]> assigned

[15:22] <arkiuat> thanks!

[17:10] <lizmat> Docs state: Returns a pseudo-random Num in the range 0..^1.

[17:11] <lizmat> for "rand"

[17:11] <lizmat> I think it's incorrect, as it does not appear to produce the value 0

[17:13] <lizmat> so the doc should perhaps be;  Returns a pseudo-random Num between 0 and 1 exclusive

[17:14] <lizmat> this also removes the 0..^1 syntax from the explanation, because that may not be recognizable as such by newbies

[17:15] <[Coke]> trying to find nqp::rand_n definition just to double check

[17:15] <lizmat> "Returns a psuedo-random bigint up to the value of the given number"

[17:29] <[Coke]> looks like the nqp docs have 3 versions there, I'm assuming that bigint text was not intended for the num version. (which it looks like rakudo uses in 'sub rand'

[17:31] <Geth> ¦ doc/Range_method_new: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/5edd606eb7

[17:32] <[Coke]> ah, found it:     return ((jfs64_generate_uint64(tc->rand_state) >> 11) * (1.0 / 9007199254740992.0));

[17:32] <Geth> ¦ doc: timo++ created pull request #4676: Add documentation for method new in Range

[17:32] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4676

[17:32] <[Coke]> ... I have no idea if that can return 0. :)

[17:33] <lizmat> looks to me only if tc->rand_state produces 0

[17:34] <[Coke]> I agree with the change to the docs, can someone whip up a commit or ticket or PR?

[17:36] <lizmat> well... are we sure  tc->rand_state  cannot produce 0 ?

[17:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/e648ccdf8d

[17:37] <lizmat> hmm... I guess it *can* produce 0 in that case, judging from some research in C code

[17:38] <lizmat> so I guess the doc is correct    sorry for the noise

[17:39] <[Coke]> I still like the edit to remove the ^ syntax.

[17:39] <[Coke]> or at least add a note there.
