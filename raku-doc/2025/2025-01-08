[16:35] <lucs> Why is "Boolean" capitalized pretty much everywhere?

[16:35] <lucs> Isn't it a simple adjective?

[16:37] <lucs> Sheesh, it seems to be capitalized all over the web too.

[16:39] <lizmat> to separate it from logical "boolean" ?

[16:40] <lucs> Appears to be more a holdover of the fact that it comes from George Boole.

[16:42] <lucs> Welp, in my personal notes, no capitalization, but clearly this would be a losing battle anywhere else.

[16:43] <lizmat> I guess the same goes for True vs true and False vs false

[16:43] <lucs> I was thinking more of usages like "boolean context".

[16:44] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[16:46] <[Coke]> wikpedia page has it capitalized, fwiw

[16:46] <lucs> Yep, capitalized almost everywhere.

[16:56] <lucs> mjd has an interesting take here: https://blog.plover.com/lang/Boolean.html

[22:52] <lucs> There's a very minor change I'd like to make in regexes.rakudoc, but I don't know how to test if the rendering will be correct.

[22:52] <lucs> How can I do that?

[23:13] <coleman> You can open a PR and the assets will be built, then you can download them from CI

[23:14] <coleman> lucs: for example, see the "Build site" job here https://buildkite.com/raku/doc-website/builds/7669#01944713-ddac-4822-98e6-bdc388df7c99

[23:15] <coleman> All our container really does is serve the exploded-out tarball of static assets with Caddy

[23:16] <coleman> We use buildah to create the container with a script. https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/blob/main/.buildkite/container.sh

[23:17] <coleman> but it is easily adapted to a Dockerfile that's about as small

[23:18] <coleman> lucs: you can also open a PR and I can reset it onto the origin/docs-dev branch, which automatically previews (after a time) on https://docs-dev.raku.org

[23:22] <lucs> I was hoping to be able to see how my proposed change would render before submitting a possibly wrong PR.

[23:22] <lucs> So instead I prepared this, maybe someone can answer the question at the end, and then I'll push a correction:

[23:32] <lucs> coleman: I'm looking at the doc-website repo.

[23:33] <lucs> I'll (eventually) read how to build the documentation locally and hopefully that will let me answer the type of question I'm asking in that png.
