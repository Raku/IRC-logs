[09:38] <wayland> Hi!  Just jumped into the backlogs, and saw your comments.  Good to hear!  When it's ready, I might be able to give it a whirl.  

[09:40] <wayland> Despite us being few in number, we have a few things coming up that are exciting: 6.e+RakuAST, and the multi-use doco framework being two.  It feels like there are just another few bits to get in place, and then it'll be like our projects got a charisma upgrade all round :) .  

[09:53] <lizmat> I like your thinking!  :-)
