[13:35] <finanalyst> [Coke] switching to raku-docs for this discusssion as its not Raku, but other language

[13:47] <coleman> finanalyst: I got your emails. new job is very intense for a couple of weeks

[13:47] <coleman> I will look at the deployment strategies this weekend 

[13:47] <coleman> right now I'm kind of a hardcore wage slave trying to be useful 

[13:49] <finanalyst> coleman: earn $$$$ 

[13:49] <finanalyst> I can wait

[13:50] <finanalyst> I have a js/css mobile issue at present

[13:50] <coleman> I will say that the most helpful thing (for me) would be to keep working on detailed build instructions and try to get a community member to test them

[13:50] <finanalyst> ok

[13:50] <coleman> I'm off now. have a good evening ðŸ˜Œ

[14:31] <[Coke]> finanalyst: nothing at all happened earlier when I clicked edit button - no errors in console, no activity on screen. both browsers

[15:28] <finanalyst> [Coke] I asked Steve Roe (librasteve) to smoke test the edit function. He got it to work.

[15:29] <finanalyst> There is a problem with modals when not running on a desktop. (I cant open on an Android)

[15:29] <finanalyst> If it cant be done in a modal, then editing will need to be in a new tab. I'll work on that
