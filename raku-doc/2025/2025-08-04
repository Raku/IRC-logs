[11:42] <wayland76> Hi!  I have a question about the new docs website.  Could the code for that be reused basically verbatim for other docs websites?  Like if Red, and/or Cro, and/or Sparrow were to write their doco in Rakudoc, would it create a nice site for them?

[13:18] <lizmat> wayland76: that's the idea, and not necessarily restricted to Raku either  :-)
