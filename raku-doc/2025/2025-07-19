[03:45] <wayland76> arkiuat: I switched to a worktree-based workflow, and, while it's more complex in some ways, it's easier in others.  So I structure my directories <repo-name>/<branch-name>/

[03:46] <wayland76> eg. doc/master/....

[03:46] <wayland76> So I have "master" be the main branch that I don't mess with, but then I go to master and, if I've already pulled down a branch called branch-a, then I go: git worktree add ../branch-a branch-a

[03:47] <wayland76> Worktrees aren't popular with eg. vscode and other tooling, but they make things easy to manage for me

[03:48] <wayland76> If you're not part of eg. a team at work, I can recommend it :)

[05:28] <arkiuat> wayland76: that's a good tip, since i'm mostly afraid of forgetting which branch i'm on (one of the people i'm learning uses fish and puts the branch name in their shell prompt!)

[11:37] <wayland76> I've posted it for the weekly, but my suggestions for categorisation are at: https://wayland.github.io/blog/raku/general/Documentation-Categorisation.xml

[11:37] <wayland76> The one thing I didn't get to was coming up with some more entries based on the index entries.

[16:49] <[Coke]> That looks amazing - please if you don't mind open a ticket in raku/doc about the categorization issue and link to that.

[16:49] <[Coke]> I can't review it all right now but don't want to lose it
