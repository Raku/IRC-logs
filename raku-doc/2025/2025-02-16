[15:55] <tbrowder> i think raku  unicode 

[16:03] <tbrowder> handling in the docs is a bit scattered. for instance, how do you enter octal, hex, and decimal code points in a string? round tripping between .comb elements as a char, code point (as an octal,  hex, or dec number), etc. should at least be in a good, single set, example (and easily found via the index or search).

[16:07] <tbrowder> i may have spoken too soon, but the search aspect could be improved.
