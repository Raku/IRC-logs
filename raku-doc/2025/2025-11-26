[20:55] <disbot6> <librasteve> arkuiat: I have some concerns about Commit 37a1e7e, please can you check the comments I made here https://github.com/Raku/doc/commit/37a1e7e971 ... and either apply them or rollback and we can do a more thorough review?

[21:54] *** lizmat_ joined
[21:54] <arkiuat> librasteve, I'll take a look, but https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3881 has just been languishing there for over four years, so let's talk about specific proposed edits to the text that has been approved and merged rather than a rollback?

[21:55] <arkiuat> I'd love to hear your ideas about how you would address issue 3881.

[21:58] *** lizmat left
[22:11] <arkiuat> I requested suggestions for cuts to this text both here and on #raku several days ago. If you have suggested cuts, they're still welcome.

[22:17] <[Coke]> I don't want to roll that back. Concrete suggestions on improvements are welcome, of course.

[22:17] <[Coke]> I will say I have seen many times "why is this off by..."

[22:17] <[Coke]> Would you feel better if this section was in Traps, perhaps?

[22:27] <[Coke]> (which brings me to: I don't like traps, and think they should be closer to the primary docs they're addressing)

[22:32] <disbot6> <librasteve> this discussion has been running 4 years, I have been an active colocutor in the various discussions, the last contribution from me https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/497 was to 100% agree with I think the sooner we decouple from it (POSIX) the better. (author Arkuiat). Now in a matter of two days this concensus has been reversed - no attempt to decouple from POSIX has been done and the main view I have

[22:32] <disbot6> expressed (ie that for Raku Instant this is an OS level "don't care" now has been released as a long detailed description about how raku Instant suffers from the woes of POSIX timestamps (when in fact Raku design has gone to lengths to avoid this negative association)

[22:33] <disbot6> <librasteve> so pleae can we do a review that allows for concensus among the interested folks?

[22:34] * [Coke] raises his hands and lets librasteve own this one.

[22:34] <[Coke]> Sure, go ahead, revert it.

[22:34] <[Coke]> sorry, arkiuat.

[22:34] <[Coke]> afk

[22:36] <Geth> ¦ doc: coke assigned to librasteve Issue Make the role of "leap seconds" more obvious in DateTime and Instant https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3881
