[03:10] <arkiuat> well, duh. To answer my own question, I tried it out, and found that there are at least 3 occurrences of "L<Regex|/language/regexes>" in that document, none put there by me, but also that lower-casing the word "regex" does in fact satisfy the test that was complaining

[14:06] <[Coke]> that test needs a skiplist for things that are class names but can safely point elsewhere.

[14:08] <[Coke]> I apologize, as I cannot find an issue or TODO comment reflecting this.

[14:08] <[Coke]> Please feel free to 1) ignore failures of that type for now (it's why that test is still in xt/ and not run on each commit), and if you could, please open a ticket and assign it to me.

[16:13] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat assigned to coke Issue xt/rakudoc-types.rakutest failing on valid links https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4730

[16:14] <arkiuat> done, and thanks. No need for apologies!

[16:16] <arkiuat> I was running util/test-modified.sh -- is that the right one, or should I not be running the /xt tests?

[16:16] <arkiuat> oh no, I see you're telling me that I can safely ignore failed /xt tests.  Gotcha.

[16:19] <arkiuat> I haven't submitted the PR that set that off yet, because it's for https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4318 which hasn't quite reached consensus and is currently assigned to @raiph and not me

[19:04] <[Coke]> I have in the past assigned things to raiph because he tends to dump so much text on a ticket without giving a PR.

[19:04] <[Coke]> If you have a PR brewing for something assigned to him, just submit it, no worries from me.

[19:56] <arkiuat> got it.

[19:58] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat self-assigned Docs on exceptions do not mention failures at all. https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3978
