[01:31] <wayland76> Also, [Coke], please don't take my comments on the issue you linked as siding with tbrowder (hi! :) ) against your comments about these things not belonging in places.  If you think my position contradicts yours, feel free to reject that too :) .  Was just looking to see if there was a workable solution in the middle.  

[01:39] <[Coke]> Just looking for feedback.

[01:40] <[Coke]> wayland76: what version of raku are you using?

[01:41] <[Coke]> and no, that test should be *very* quick - it is making a call via curl, though, so it might be hanging on that

[01:42] <[Coke]> it's only "are you using the latest version of raku to run the tests" because at least some of the tests are expecting the latest (e.g. rakuast)

[01:43] <[Coke]> the perl-version is coming from Test::Meta

[02:29] <wayland76> I'm using like 2024.09 on my local.  If I want newer, I jump into a Docker container.  

[02:29] <wayland76> And it was still hanging one minute before I wrote this message.  

[02:30] <wayland76> Regarding perl-version, agreed, but do I need to do something about it, or can I ignore it?  

[02:36] <[Coke]> never seen that error before

[02:36] <[Coke]> check issues under test::meta?

[02:38] <[Coke]> wayland76: can you run the curl command in that test file by hand?
