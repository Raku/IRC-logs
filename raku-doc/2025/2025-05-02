[14:54] <[Coke]> started some feedback on the PR (nothing about the content yet, more "can you make this test pass")

[15:34] <[Coke]> when generating the website are we now using the RAKUAST processing, or the original grammar still?

[15:34] <[Coke]> wondering if I can switch over raku/doc to just use RAKUAST for everything now.

[15:36] <[Coke]> I guess it doesn't matter, actually, since all the testing is on the "to text" version or the rakuast structure, not the rendering to html
