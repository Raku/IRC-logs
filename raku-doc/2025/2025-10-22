[20:01] <arkiuat> [Coke], the conflict is between (orig) Language/modules.rakudoc lines 52-536 and (wayland's rewrite) Languages/distributions/uploading.rakudoc lines 692-1176

[20:01] <arkiuat> I've cloned wayland's repo, so I can isolate those out and diff them directly to see just how much is in conflict

[20:02] <arkiuat> the only other conflict is in .gitignore and I suspect wayland didn't even intend those changes to carry over, so we can just drop those

[20:03] <arkiuat> the line count of the two sections is both 484, so probably only minor changes

[20:09] <arkiuat> well, those line numbers aren't quite correct (they're comparing main and modules-rewrite from wayland's repo) but I still think I can isolate the diff

[20:14] <arkiuat> yeah, I'm confused now. This is trickier to do by hand on someone else's work than I thought

[20:18] <arkiuat> wayland's Language/distributions/uploading.rakudoc only has 81 lines in it, so I got it confused with something from the actual merge-conflict file I'm looking at in my local clone repo

[20:20] <arkiuat> I'm throwing in the towel, but I can condense what I've written here into a comment on the PR if you think that might be helpful for whoever looks at it next. I'm sure it would be easier with write access

[20:21] <arkiuat> (and now I'm not asking for write access yet: I did this because I thought I might learn a bit more about branches and merging. Still too much of a novice)

[20:22] <arkiuat> s/now/no/

[22:42] <[Coke]> I will absolutely give you write access if that helps. :)

[22:43] <[Coke]> You've done a bunch in the past few weeks. (same for ds)
