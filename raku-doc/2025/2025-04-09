[14:52] <finanalyst> i'll look now

[14:53] <[Coke]> Thanks - it's a cleanup of some indexing.

[14:53] <[Coke]> Might actually close some other heading bugs, though I haven't looked at those.

[15:22] <finanalyst> Ive provided a long explanation. Basically its a cleanup, but Rakuast::RakuDoc fixes them anyway.

[15:40] <finanalyst> [Coke] I'm still hacking on a github problem and getting nowhere. 

[15:41] <finanalyst> I thought lizmat sena_kun and I had a solution path, but it hit the same wall

[15:41] <finanalyst> basically I'm trying and failing to get the github API for creating a PR to work.

[15:42] <finanalyst> I'm still reading so eventually I should find a solution

[15:50] <[Coke]> +1
