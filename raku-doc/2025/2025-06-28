[05:46] <wayland> Great!  

[05:55] <wayland> Hi!  Just wanted to say that https://docs.raku.org/introduction is too big.  It's the first entry point for a developer.  It should just have 3 links (in the following order): "Tutorials", "Migrating from Other Languages", and "Contributing to the Documentation".  Each link should be a card that links to a relevant page.

[12:32] <[Coke]> I think the right answer is maybe between 3 and a 100, but yes.

[18:40] * [Coke] needs to remember how to publish the web site.

[18:40] <[Coke]> even docs-dev isn't updated yet.
