[13:00] <arkiuat> It just occurred to me that it's a pretty important general principle, when documenting a newly implemented feature, to focus the documentation on describing the behavior required in the roast tests and not just what the documenter found out by experimenting with the feature as currently implemented 

[13:00] <arkiuat> Do we state this anywhere in documentation guidelines?

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat++ created pull request #4647: add method .multi-invocant to class Parameter

[14:14] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4647

[14:24] <arkiuat> ds7832, I totally agree with you about adding slurpies to the discussion at the beginning of language/signatures

[14:25] <ds7832> perfect!

[14:30] <arkiuat> tbrowder, your https://github.com/tbrowder/tidbits/blob/master/Contributing-PRs.md is very helpful. Thank you! I've been using it, but it might be good to add to run the util/test-modified.sh script right before committing

[14:31] <arkiuat> I always forget to do that until right after I commit on my local fork, after which I think it just says "nothing to test"

[14:36] <ds7832> Another roast relevant to ;; is this one: # https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3611

[14:37] <ds7832> uh, this one https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/b822369da22c305b84968acdb04328eeb3bd8947/S06-multi/subsignature.t

[14:41] <librasteve_> tellable6: arkuiat Hello!

[14:42] <librasteve_> .seen jnthn

[14:43] <librasteve_> m: say 0.1+0.2

[14:46] <arkiuat> [Coke] sorry about the whitespace. This is the second time I forgot to run util/test-modified.sh until after the local commit, but I'm trying not to make a habit of it!

[14:46] <arkiuat> thanks librasteve

[14:58] <tbrowder>  arkiuat: thanks, glad you found it useful. please submit your suggestion as a PR. and i'm sure it could use some more love based on my recent bad record of PRs for Raku doc PRs!

[15:04] <ds7832> arkiuat: I've just found something on what's behind the title "Long names" of the section on ;;

[15:04] <ds7832> https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S14-roles/parameterized-mixin.t

[15:04] <ds7832> Ctrl+f for ;; and then the long comment right above that

[15:12] *** arkiuat left
[15:24] *** arkiuat joined
[15:28] *** arkiuat left
[15:43] *** arkiuat joined
[15:43] <librasteve_> hmm seems to me that Long Name is a confusing header name here - it’s an implementation detail and doesn’t need to be part of the docs

[15:48] *** arkiuat left
[15:50] *** arkiuat joined
[15:53] <ds7832> Yes, I definitely think it should be changed. Perhaps "Disregarding parameters in multi-dispatch"

[16:01] <ds7832> So the rakudoc code for the title would become something like

[16:01] <ds7832> =head1 X<Disregarding parameters for multi-dispatch|Language,Long names;Syntax,;;>

[16:01] <ds7832> but I bet that the ;; at the end will be interpreted incorrectly as rakudoc syntax, right? https://github.com/Raku/doc/blob/main/writing-docs/INDEXING.md

[16:03] <ds7832> (unfortunately I haven't gotten local compilation of the docs system set up yet)

[16:33] <arkiuat> tbrowder, I'll submit that PR as soon as I've actually used util/test-modified.sh myself for the first time

[16:33] <arkiuat> or shortly thereafter, anyway

[16:34] <librasteve_> ds7832: how about “Disregarding Parameters” ;-)

[16:35] <ds7832> oh, that would solve all problems at once!

[20:19] <tbrowder> arkiuat: i think that "tidbits" needs a better name. i was reluctant to pick a better name because of possible GitHub copyright issues. maybe make it a raku module?

[20:35] <[Coke]> arkiuat: Might be worth mentioning in writing-docs if you want to submit a note

[20:35] <[Coke]> arkiuat: note that PRs are now going through CI and so most of those tests are run when you submit the PR

[20:36] <[Coke]> e.g. https://github.com/Raku/doc/actions/runs/18347647995/job/52258603776?pr=4647

[20:36] <[Coke]> So just make sure your checks pass. It's OK if the PR goes in and you then fix it right away

[22:01] <ds7832> Coke: Thanks for merging!

[22:03] <ds7832> (I hope all the links I added work)

[22:07] <[Coke]> There's a test for links.

[22:07] <[Coke]> rakudoc-l - set NETWORK_TESTING=1 to test remote links

[22:07] <[Coke]> That one isn't run by default on PRs

[22:08] <ds7832> Ah, it's actually only internal ones

[22:08] <[Coke]> Running a full rakudoc-l check (w/out network) now to heck

[22:08] <ds7832> very cool!

[22:42] <[Coke]> ds7832: https://gist.github.com/coke/85455a5e391c39c0b4ccc5188c0dd272

[22:42] <[Coke]> only a few failures if you want to tackle them... though some may be "hey, this entire doc page needs to be created"

[22:42] <[Coke]> there's a summary at the bottom, otherwise scan for 'not ok'

[22:43] <[Coke]> (looks like it's all older errors missing Exceptions

[22:43] <[Coke]> Also see:

[22:44] <[Coke]> ... can't find it- used to be a page showing all the 404s live on the site, also

[22:45] <[Coke]> might have been lost in the last site cleanup

[22:45] <[Coke]> aha, google had it: https://docs.raku.org/error-report

[22:45] <[Coke]> That one is smarter because it builds the site so can check constructed pages.

[22:51] <ds7832> Thanks

[22:52] <ds7832> looks like all errors in signatures.rakudoc were there before, good.

[22:53] <ds7832> I have more edits in my mind for the first two sections of that file, which I'll likely do tomorrow (Berlin time)

[22:54] <ds7832> but I've bookmarked these two links for potential future work

[23:16] <[Coke]> Awesome. thanks for all the edits!
