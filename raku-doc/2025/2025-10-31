[14:07] <ds7832> arkiuat: good point regarding the flags in create-cli.rakudoc (https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4688#issuecomment-3467955926). I think what would make even more sense is a real-life example on the use of flags in CLIs – something where folks could readily see themselves using it. I'll try to think up something.

[17:18] <arkiuat> ds7832: whenever I saw that bit-flag example, I just imagined that someone had written a Raku CLI tool to help mangle some data that was coming out of a packet-capture or perhaps a device driver, so translating raw bits to an enum to make things easier to work with made sense to me

[17:18] <arkiuat> I didn't think that particular example needed ay change in that aspect

[17:19] <arkiuat> s/ay/any/

[17:21] <arkiuat> because I could "see myself using it" as you say, and literally did so when I first encountered. But I suppose you are right that most folks won't
