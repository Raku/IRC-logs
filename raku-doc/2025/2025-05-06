[17:52] <finanalyst> lizmat & [Coke]: please take a look at [new about](https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/about)

[17:53] <finanalyst> At lizmat 's suggestion, authors with < 10 commits are moved to Others. Top 8 contributors on top of graphic, remainder underneath.

[17:53] <finanalyst> hover over graph and over author names

[17:57] <[Coke]> I find the graphic incredibly busy.

[17:58] <[Coke]> the others is an improvement, but I'm not sure anyone is going to get any useful information off that graph.

[18:00] <[Coke]> also, there's not a lot *in* others - so many people still seem to have their own line with <30 commits.
