[14:55] <arkiuat> so I was wondering whether it would make sense to move the doco for sub sleep-until from class Date to class Instant, and for sub sleep & sub sleep-timer from Date into either DateTime or Instant.  It doesn't really make any sense for these three to be under Date, but I thought it needed some discussion before I created an issue

[15:05] <[Coke]> Yup. the fact that it's defined in there is a implementation detail.

[15:05] <[Coke]> (it's outside of the class def..)

[15:06] <[Coke]> ... actually I'm not sure it belongs with *any* class.

[15:07] <[Coke]> but if you have an argument that it's better in one class than where it is now, that's still an improvement.

[15:45] <arkiuat> where in the docs could these possibly go other than in the doc for some class or role? I hadn't considered that as a possibility

[15:46] <arkiuat> It's just that these three are dealing with seconds of time, or Instant objects, neither of which really have anything to do with the Date class

[23:08] <arkiuat> of course I feel silly that I forgot all about that. I've edited https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4628 accordingly, as that's probably a better place for them than DateTime
