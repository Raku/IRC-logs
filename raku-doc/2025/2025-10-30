[13:51] <lizmat> arkiuat: thanks for the headsup, should be updating again now

[13:51] <arkiuat> thanks for fixing it! lizmat++

[14:08] <arkiuat> next on my list is C<push>: method push is documented in class Any, and sub push is documented in Independent Routines. Do I unify these into a single C<routine push> entry in Any.rakudoc?

[14:08] <arkiuat> that's my inclination, but the way things are right now is not *obviously* wrong, so I'm going to pass over it for now and come back to it later if needed

[14:11] <lizmat> if so, rinse repeat for append

[14:11] <arkiuat> exactly. I'm putting those similar cases into a "revist" category while I go look for more obviously-wrong stuff

[14:24] <arkiuat> It looks like deepmap, duckmap, nodemap are the next batch that have undocumented sub forms (same kind of case as any, all, none, one)
