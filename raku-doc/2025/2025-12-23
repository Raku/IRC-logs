[00:32] <[Coke]> For the annual wrapup advent blog post, anything we want to call out from the docs side? My #1 thing to mention is we have several new active volunteers which is great. A very distant second, we fixed the CI to make it faster and get more immediate automatic feedback on PRs.

[06:18] <arkiuat> the work on issue 4560 might be a very distant third. I might not be the only who didn't realize that "routine/sub/method" headings were supposed to mean anything in particular because they were so inconsistently applied

[06:19] <arkiuat> but it's a long-term project that we started making progress on, so that's something

[06:21] <arkiuat> I think if we had gotten wayland's Modules rewrite in, *that* would be the not-so-distant third

[06:21] <arkiuat> I hope we can merge that soon

[06:22] <arkiuat> even if it is really more of a re-org than a re-write
