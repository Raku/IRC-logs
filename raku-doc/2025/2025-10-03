[15:12] <ds7832> https://docs.raku.org/language/typesystem#Undefinedness - Here it reads: "Instances of objects created by .CREATE are by convention defined. The method .defined will return Bool::True to indicate definedness. The exceptions to that rule are Nil and Failure."  This seems to be out of date with regard to Nil:

[15:12] <ds7832> m: my $n = Nil.CREATE; $n.defined

[15:13] <ds7832> ... gives `True` in the REPL

[15:17] <ds7832> I'm not sure though if there are other relevant intricacies about Nil, so I don't think it makes sense for me to make a PR on this subject.

[16:21] <Geth> ¦ doc: schultzdavid++ created pull request #4630: In `operators.rakudoc#infix_.=`, clarify usage of infix & postfix operator, and add link

[16:21] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4630

[17:07] <[Coke]> ... that's weird, as Nil.CREATE just returns a regular Nil as far as dd is concerned.
