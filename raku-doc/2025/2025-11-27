[15:53] <[Coke]> librasteve - again, no worries. I hadn't seen the related problem solving ticket. If you see a docs PR come through that has a topic you feel strongly on, please mark yourself as reviewer.

[16:17] <arkiuat> librasteve: no worries. We all care a lot about this language, and so feelings run high sometimes.

[16:19] <arkiuat> However, I'm sorry, but I've closely reread the discussion in https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/497 and the text that I added to the Instant doc, and I'm simply not finding the conflict you're trying to point out.

[16:20] <arkiuat> Issue 497 is all about an epoch or lack of same, while in the addition to the documentation, I was very careful to avoid any discussion or even mention of epochs, and confine myself to talking about the differences/deltas between POSIX time and what's tracked by Instant: which is exactly what docs issue 9881 wanted to have explained.

[16:21] <arkiuat> I'd like to alter the text to address your concern, but I need some help from you in figuring out what your concern is exactly.

[16:30] <arkiuat> Also, I personally do not think that Instant suffers from the woes of POSIX timestamps, and in fact resolves the problems with them. The only thing in this discussion that suffers the woes of POSIX timestamps is POSIX timestamps themselves.  I'd be very surprised to discover that a text I wrote conveys an opinion opposite to the one that I actually hold.

[16:31] <arkiuat> s/in fact/instead I think that in fact/

[16:37] <arkiuat> perhaps I was excessively cautious in trying to be objective and not push my own agenda, which would be to abandon the use of POSIX timestamps ASAP and adopt the Int or Real (as appropriate) form of Instant for that purpose instead.

[18:20] <disbot6> <librasteve> arkuiat: , coke: many thanks for your forbearance ... I will review the new text and try to better clarify my concerns and to propose a cosntructive progression from it ...
