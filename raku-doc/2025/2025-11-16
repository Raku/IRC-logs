[11:15] <lizmat> feels like roast's  CONTRIBUTING.md could use a makeover

[11:16] <arkiuat> it seems to me that the failed space-after-comma test on PR 4714 is spurious, because I'm discussing the comma operator and marking it up as such. I couldn't find any "real" commas without spaces after them.

[11:16] <arkiuat> however, I'm not sure I got all the new links right

[11:18] <arkiuat> good morning lizmat :)

[20:03] <lizmat> reading through https://docs.raku.org/language/operators  I wonder why the description of the operators is mixed in with the precedence of the operators

[20:03] <lizmat> in my experience, the precedence of an operator is generally of lesser importance

[20:32] <lizmat> am I the only one ?

[21:22] <ds7832> personally I've so far only consulted this document when some other document linked to a subsection on a specific operator, and then I've only read that exact subsection or and maybe parts of the overarching section. Thus it has always been very rare that I encountered any of the text about precedence. *But* I actually like knowing that it's in there, to be read when I want to read up on it; and more importantly, I think it makes sense: When one wants to learn 

[21:22] <ds7832> the order of operator precedence, I think it helps significantly to have the list of all concrete operators right there, ready to construct examples from.

[21:23] <ds7832> in other words: for understanding precedence, it helps to have the operators there; for understanding individual operators, it is at least no disadvantage to have a few sections on precedence at the very top.

[21:24] <ds7832> But, in fairness, I may have a bias for the status quo on this

[21:43] <arkiuat> I have to agree with lizmat on this one. I've always thought that precedence was a weird choice to use for ordering the operator docs. I'd rather see operator precedence discussed in an article dedicated to only that topic. 

[21:44] <arkiuat> But on the other hand, I don't have a ready candidate for how else to order the operator docs (alphabetical doesn't make any sense here, really), and frankly, there's no particular rhyme or reason to the ordering of the methods in each documented type/class. 

[21:44] <arkiuat> +either

[22:34] <ds7832> If it's about the ordering of the various sections, there might be better ordering principles than precedence. (Incidentally, I briefly became aware of this just yesterday.) One option, is of course to try to group most of them by the action they perform (e.g. or *return a specific type* like a Bool, Array, Numeric, Block,... or *return type dependent on input* like `//`, `andthen` & friends, and the Reduction operators,...  or those that *assign* a RHS to a LSH 

[22:34] <ds7832> or ). One will probably make some exceptions e.g. to keep all the regex operators together despite them performing different "actions". Also, one may want to put (non-meta) Z, X, x, xx and perhaps ... and ^ (as in 1...5 and ^5) into the same section, even though they don't all produce the same type; that section should then probably be located right above the Metaoperators section, since many of them have a Metaoperator variant.
