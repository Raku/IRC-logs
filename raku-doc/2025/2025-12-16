[01:52] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat++ created pull request #4734: issue 3881: two new glossary entries "UTC" & "timescale"

[01:52] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4734

[01:53] <arkiuat> also, PR 4733 is up for review as well https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4733

[02:27] <arkiuat> argh. I'm still having trouble with branches. I definitely made two separate branches for those two different PRs, but somehow both of the commits showed up on the second PR. I'll have to figure out what I did that sent the first commit to both branches instead of just to the one I intended.

[02:28] <arkiuat> But hey, at least I'm a lot better at this stuff than I was six months ago
