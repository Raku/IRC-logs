[00:26] <arkiuat> ds7832, I'm afraid I can't help think this one through. I've never managed to absorb all of the section you're working on in one sitting, and I generally refer only to specific bits or pieces of it at a time, as a reference, so I have no insight as to how to clarify the whole thing, although it could use some improvement.

[00:27] <arkiuat> However, I will say that I don't find "effectful quoting" any clearer than "quote protection", and I suspect that "quote protection" is something that a lot of us are used to hearing. I'm not sure I've ever seen "effectful" used as a word before.

[00:29] <arkiuat> In fact, for me, I didn't have much trouble understand what was meant by "quote protection" when I first read this, but I would have had no idea what was meant by "effectful quoting"

[00:30] <arkiuat> +ing

[01:12] <[Coke]> I don't like "effectful" there.

[01:14] <[Coke]> well, anywhere.

[12:30] <ds7832> Thank you for the feedback regarding Quoting. Yes, then "effectful" is off the table. I now tend toward leaving "quote protection" in, even more so since "Word splitting with quote protection" etc. would in fact work quite well, I think.
