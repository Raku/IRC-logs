[00:43] <wayland> Hi all!  I'm working on a reorg of this section at the moment: https://docs.raku.org/language/modules#Manually

[01:10] <SmokeMachine> wayland: thanks

[01:12] <wayland> SmokeMachine: No worries :)

[02:18] <wayland> Not sure where this needs to be reported, but when I run the following command, there should be an error and there isn't: raku --rakudoc=aerhg doc/Language/modules.rakudoc

[12:22] <[Coke]> that's a rakudo bug.

[12:23] <[Coke]> can you submit that with a comparison of raku --doc=aerhg foo?

[12:34] <wayland76> When I try to run "make test" on the documentation, I get "Could not find Test-Files".  I can't find a module to install for that.  Any tips as to what I need to do?  

[12:42] <wayland76> I've just tested on latest (well, nightly from last week), and if I use --doc, it gives me the correct error, but if I use --rakudoc, it doesn't error.  My question is why we have both --doc and --rakudoc (ie. should I be instead saying "Get rid of rakudoc")?  

[12:52] <[Coke]> one is for rakudoc v2

[12:53] <[Coke]> I have to defer to lizmat and finanalyst on that question

[12:53] <[Coke]> I think eventually we'll just have one.

[12:53] <[Coke]> (note that each one is picking from a different class hierarchy, btw.)

[12:54] <[Coke]> wayland76: try "RAKULIB=. make xtest"

[12:55] <[Coke]> apologies, I was cleaning up the repo at some point and perhaps didn't leave it quite right. :(

[12:55] <[Coke]> a patch which adds that RAKULIB env var setting to the makefile for test and xtest appreciated.

[14:00] <[Coke]> ah, also please read writing-docs/TESTING.md

[16:26] <[Coke]> so, I take that back on the makefile change - you can either install the deps (as per the .md) or you can set RAKULIB=. yourself

[22:19] <[Coke]> If anyone has opinions on my and tbrowder's disagreement in https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4569#issuecomment-2831297781, please chime in on the ticket.

[22:52] <wayland> [Coke]: On the different rakudoc versions, that makes sense.  

[22:52] <wayland> [Coke]: On "Read the Fine Manual", thanks, that got me going :)

[22:56] <[Coke]> wayland: I honestly forgot I wrote that down

[22:56] <[Coke]> I was going in there to *add* it when I saw I already had. :)

[23:12] *** wayland76 joined
[23:12] <wayland76> OK, as recommended by the docs, I ran "util/test-modified.sh" and it has two problems.  

[23:13] <wayland76> 1. t/00-meta.rakutest ................     # required attribute 'perl-version' is not defined

[23:14] *** wayland left
[23:14] <wayland76> 2. I think it's been stuck on "xt/01-raku-version.rakutest" for a good 5-10 minutes; is that normal?  

[23:35] <wayland76> Btw, is it a known thing that our results in Google suddenly became a lot less useful-looking about a month ago?  

[23:36] <wayland76> It might be a robots.txt entry that's doing it.
