[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: Remove the obvious installation methods

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: 

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: Noting that one can install Rakudo via e.g. the distro packages provides

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: no real benefit (as that's obvious) but clutters the presentation.

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: 

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: rakudo-pkg is kept, because it's standalone and wouldn't be seen at all

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: otherwise.

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: 

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: Alpine is kept because it's important to note that our precompiled packages

[14:10] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: don't work there.
