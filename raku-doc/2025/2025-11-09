[09:49] * lizmat notices use of superstitious parens in https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_==%3E   : my @array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

[09:49] <lizmat> that only works because of the single arg rule

[18:09] <disbot1> <librasteve> hmmm this is odd, the docs say https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Item_and_list_assignment my $b = 1,2,3;     # item assignment to Scalar (same as preceding example) say $b; # OUTPUT: «1␤»

[18:09] <disbot1> <librasteve> but my testing has my $b = 1,2,3; say $b; # OUTPUT (1 2 3)

[18:10] <disbot1> <librasteve> are the docs wrong?

[18:12] <disbot1> <librasteve> oh - the docs are right - I did my testing in the repl, so maybe this is a repl issue? is it worthy of filing? if so, where?

[19:25] <arkiuat> however, if I do this in the REPL

[19:25] <arkiuat> my $a = 1, 2, 3; .say for $a

[19:26] <arkiuat> I get output of just:

[19:26] <arkiuat> 1

[19:26] <arkiuat> m: my $a = 1, 2, 3; .say for $a

[19:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 690b7f07a: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤1␤Useless use of constant integer 3 in sink context (lines 1, 1)␤Useless use of constant integer 2 in sink context (lines 1, 1)␤»

[19:29] <arkiuat> if I put the say (after a semicolon) on the same line as the assigment in the REPL, it works as documented

[19:29] <arkiuat> only if you make the assignment in the REPL on a line by itself does it assign the whole list to the scalar

[19:32] <arkiuat> This *seems* like an intentional UI feature to save keystrokes

[21:15] <disbot1> <librasteve> arkuiat: that is not quite what I am seeing ... in the repl if I go my $a = 1,2,3 the reflection is (1 2 3), but on the next line I go $a with reflection 1

[21:17] <disbot1> <librasteve> I get a the same reflection, but a different result if I add parens on the rhs like my $a = (1,2,3), then $a on the next line shows (1 2 3)

[21:19] <disbot1> <librasteve> I put this down to the way the repl loop reflects the previous line of code that seems to contradict the actual raku compiler behaviour (which, of course, is the correct interpretation) ... thus my question is this a repl bug

[22:16] <disbot1> <jubilatious1_98524> m: my $b = 1,2,3; say $b;

[22:16] <disbot1> <Raku eval>  1  WARNINGS for /home/glot/main.raku: Useless use of constant integer 2 in sink context (lines 1, 1) Useless use of constant integer 3 in sink context (lines 1, 1) 

[22:39] <disbot1> <librasteve> =b

[23:35] <arkiuat> librasteve, hmm

[23:48] <disbot1> <nahita3882> my $b = 1, 2, 3 evaluates to a List: it is equivalent to the more verbose ((my $b = 1), 2, 3)

[23:49] <disbot1> <nahita3882> and my $b = 1 evaluates to what's assigned, so (1, 2, 3) arises

[23:53] <disbot1> <nahita3882> in REPL, when you are not sinking this, e.g., doing > my $b = 1, 2, 3 and  pressing enter, Evaluated list of 3 things is Printed

[23:55] <disbot1> <nahita3882> but if it is sinking, it warns about those dangling 2 and 3

[23:57] <disbot1> <nahita3882> raku -e analogue is raku -e'say my $b = 1, 2, 3 versus raku -e'my $b = 1, 2, 3'
