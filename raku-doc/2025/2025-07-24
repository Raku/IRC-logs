[17:45] <arkiuat> m: my $s = 'old string'; say +($s ~~ tr/dol/wne/)

[17:45] <arkiuat> m: my $s = 'old string'; say +($s ~~ tr/dol/wne/)

[17:45] <arkiuat> arg. sorry about all that. one more

[17:46] <arkiuat> m: my $s = 'old string'; say +($s ~~ tr/dol/wne/)

[17:46] <arkiuat> wow I keep typing + and a ~ keeps showing up on irc. That's really weird

[17:46] <arkiuat> anyway, the thing that stringifies to 'new string' there is supposed to numify to 3 (the distance between the two strings). It's a StrDistance object

[17:47] <arkiuat> The documentation for ~~ says "see ACCEPTS documentation for the type on the right-hand side of the operator". StrDistance doesn't have a documented ACCEPTS method, and neither does its parent Cool, and the behavior documented for the ACCEPTS method of Any (Cool's parent class) is not what I see going on here.  So which ACCEPTS method is getting called by ~~ here?

[17:48] <arkiuat> wow, sorry, folks, I'm bad at using irssi. That was supposed to go to #raku, not #raku-doc, but perhaps it's better discussed here since my question originates from trying to follow the documentation

[17:48] <arkiuat> m: my $s = 'old string'; say ~($s ~~ tr/dol/wne)

[17:49] <arkiuat> oh right, no Camelia on #raku-doc
