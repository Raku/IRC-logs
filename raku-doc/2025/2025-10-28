[16:16] <ds7832> [Coke]: actually I was thinking "does this really need to be marked as draft? it can probably be merged right away" :)

[16:17] <[Coke]> I will merge it right now

[16:18] <ds7832> perfect. (Oh yeah, that PR closing spree was kind of impressive to watch it happen)

[16:19] <[Coke]> Guilt motivated.

[16:25] <ds7832> By the way: Is there already some docs page dedicated to introspection? I think it that would be very useful to have for learners at pretty much every level.

[16:26] <[Coke]> sure, search doc index for introspection

[16:28] <ds7832> huh, true. for some reason the search box didn't show me things a couple of minutes ago.

[18:42] <arkiuat> ds7832, thanks for the tip! that's just the sort of thing I was looking for. I had gone over the doc entries on introspection, but it's kind of scattered, and I don't think I ever found an example of or documentation for .candidates[0].signature and the like, although I could probably have sussed it out if I had spent some more time thinking harder about what I did read

[18:49] <ds7832> arkiuat: yeah, for that reason I've started keeping brief notes on all the introspection methods. That will probably be useful to you too: https://pastebin.com/S9zcrnYP

[18:50] <ds7832> I should probably put that in a personal repo for others to edit, and maybe in the end it can become incorporated into the docs

[18:52] <arkiuat> cool!

[18:53] <ds7832> I've now put it on Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/dss/raku-notes/src/branch/main/introspection.txt
