[13:01] <tbrowder> [Coke]: before i work on yr comments on my PR, i thought we were in agreement about diff between use of '' vs "": use '' when the word or short phrase is followed by a period or comma, or semicolon; othewise use the "" form and put the period, comma, or semi inside. that is what i was changing.

[16:51] <Geth> ¦ doc: schultzdavid++ created pull request #4636: In `typesystem.rakudoc`, replace ambiguous word "it" by explicit "`.bless`"

[16:51] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4636

[17:43] <[Coke]> tbrowder: is that written down in our style guide somewhere? Sorry, I didn't recall that.

[17:45] <[Coke]> read https://docs.raku.org/type/Int vs ... is the doc site super slow right now or is it just me.

[17:47] <[Coke]> vs https://docs.raku.org/language/nativetypes

[17:51] <[Coke]> int is a native type and use only the required memory. Ints are full on objects with tons of methods.

[17:52] <[Coke]> But, because everything is an object... if you treat an int like an object... it upgrades it to an Int so you can call methods on it.

[17:53] <[Coke]> m; my int $a = 3; my Int $b = 4; dd $a, $b, $a.is-prime, $b.is-prime

[17:53] <[Coke]> m: my int $a = 3; my Int $b = 4; dd $a, $b, $a.is-prime, $b.is-prime

[17:53] <[Coke]> 3

[17:53] <[Coke]> Int $b = 4

[17:53] <[Coke]> Bool::True

[17:53] <[Coke]> Bool::False

[17:55] <[Coke]> So you could theoretically create native arrays of ints and have them use closer to the amount of memory you'd expect from C as opposed to a full object representation

[17:58] <[Coke]> tbrowder: don't see any mention of quotes under writing-docs - sorry, I don't remember that convo, apologies.

[17:58] <[Coke]> (doesn't mean it didn't happen!)
