[22:58] <tbrowder> hi, i'm working on a PR for JJ's distro Pod::Load (JJ av

[23:00] <[Coke]> ok; don;t think raku/doc* use that module

[23:14] <tbrowder> *aka jmerelo). my question is, what should modern terminology should i use: pod, pod6, or ?

[23:14] <tbrowder> it does work for the current "pod"

[23:20] <coleman> tbrowder: I'd post this in #raku to get more opinions on this

[23:20] <coleman> or open an issue on JJ's repo

[23:20] <coleman> you can link the issue in #raku to drive traffic over there

[23:35] <tbrowder> ok, good idea
