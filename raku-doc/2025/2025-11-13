[00:06] <[Coke]> the glossary entry for Virtual Machine could be cleaned up (at least to remove parrot)

[00:53] <tbrowder> i just looked at docs for defining a new Date and didn’t notice the new, cool way of doing: my $d = Date.now without the parens. Also this works now:  my $year = Date.now.year

[17:54] <arkiuat> looking https://docs.raku.org/type/Any#method_duckmap is there some transition missing in the paragraph that begins with "In the second case," and ends with "In this case:" ?

[17:55] <arkiuat> Or is it just me and I'm missing something?

[18:04] <[Coke]> if I were scanning it, it would read the same as if ". In this case" were removed, but after reading it a few times, I'm not sure the example after that is another example of that behavior

[18:04] <[Coke]> maybe check git history to see if someone accidentally elided some text?

[18:08] <arkiuat> that's just what I was thinking of doing; thanks for confirming

[18:09] <arkiuat> I didn't want to start digging if it was just a hallucination on my part

[18:19] <arkiuat> Nope, it looks as if that whole passage through to the end of the entry is exactly as it first appeared on 2018-05-07 when JJ extended the duckmap definition. Hasn't been touched since then.

[18:20] <arkiuat> s/definition/explanation/

[18:21] <arkiuat> so JJ might have accidentally elided something from his own draft, but that's just speculation

[18:21] <[Coke]> Add it to the pile, I guess.

[18:24] <arkiuat> yeah, i was just trying to do the Issue 4560 thing. Even before I got to that part, I was thinking it might need to be rewritten because doubling every example of use as a method with the same, but used as a sub, leaves a rather unwieldy result

[18:26] <arkiuat> but yeah, rewriting the explanation of duckmap probably needs its own issue. I'll finish making it unwieldy first and then file that

[20:55] <lizmat> https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_Z   versus    https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Zip_metaoperator

[20:56] <lizmat> I do think they are the same thing,    infix:<Z> is just short for   infix:<Z,>    or am I missing something ?

[21:12] <arkiuat> well, that doesn't sound like the same thing to me, since one is a metaoperator and the other is an application of that metaoperator to C<,> but certainly the doc for infix:<Z> should mention up front that it's just short for C<Z,>

[21:13] <arkiuat> pardon my inconsistent notation
