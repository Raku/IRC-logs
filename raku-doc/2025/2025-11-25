[04:33] <arkiuat> I think I'd like to see a bit more documentation of the differences between infix:<mod> and infix:<%>. The former is said to be for Int and the latter for Numeric, but as far as I've been able to tell so far, both of them work fine on all Numerics but give different results in some cases.

[04:34] <arkiuat> And as far as I can tell, none of those differences are specified in any of the roast tests, at least not if all of them are in https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S03-operators/arith.t

[04:35] <arkiuat> so if these differences in behavior are not part of the spec, they shouldn't be in doc, but I'd like to no more about why they give different results when both are indiscriminately applied to Numerics

[04:35] <arkiuat> s/no/know

[04:37] <arkiuat> m: .say for pi % 1, pi mod 1

[04:37] <arkiuat> oh weird, I guess the behavior changed since 2025.05!

[04:38] <arkiuat> m: .say for -pi % 1, -pi mod 1

[04:38] <arkiuat> no it didn't, I just forgot the minus signs

[04:40] <arkiuat> yeah, this isn't really a documentation question, sorry

[13:47] <[Coke]> we do occasionally have doc cleanup result in bug reports or roast updates, for sure.

[17:21] <Geth> ¦ doc: arkiuat self-assigned Ad hoc exceptions are not documented well enough. https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4658

[17:25] <arkiuat> lizmat: interesting. I guess we need to specify what the desired behavior should be and test for that in roast?

[17:29] <arkiuat> here's a version of the interesting example Voldenet posted on #raku

[17:29] <arkiuat> m: with -7.7 -> $a { .say for $a % 2.1, $a mod 2.1, $a % 1.9, $a mod 1.9 }
