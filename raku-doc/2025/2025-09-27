[17:27] <[Coke]> we have a test in raku/doc that checks for things like C<Mu> to ensure that we are also linking to the Mu type.

[17:28] <[Coke]> there are false positives like C<utf8> which is referring to, e.g. utf8 in general, or some other language's type of Int that has the same name... Any suggestion on how to mark the docs so that a) it doesn't change the render, and b) the test knows not to complain?

[17:31] <[Coke]> maybe C<Z<>utf8> ?

[17:40] <[Coke]> can't be that because the C<> causes the Z<> to be literal

[17:41] <[Coke]> C<utf8>Z<> seems magical, but would that be OK?

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: With Rakudo Star v2025.08, the output of the code example is different than currently stated in the doc page. The apparent reason is that `say %hash.raku` now produces output in a different format. In this specific example, it's

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: `{:some(${:key($[Any, [Any, Any, "autovivified"]])})}`

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: Since this is rather unwieldy, I propose changing `say %hash.raku` to `say %hash`, with which the output is

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: {some => {key => [(Any) [(Any) (Any) autovivified]]}}

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: 

[23:36] <Geth> ¦ doc/main: The same output would also be produces by `say %hash.gist`.
