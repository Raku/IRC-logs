[20:32] <finanalyst> hello to everyone. I've been off line due to fatigue from radiotherapy.

[20:32] <finanalyst> coleman: thank you for approving the updates to New_Website

[20:33] <finanalyst> Has everyone had chance to review the deployment of the New_Website version on https://new-raku.finanalyst.org ?

[20:35] <finanalyst> coleman: there is a new DockerFile to replace Dockerfile. And it generates the website that can be seen on new-raku

[20:36] <finanalyst> Would it make sense for the new-raku deployment to be visible on docs-dev.raku.org

[20:37] <finanalyst> would it make sense to have a conference call with the docs team to discuss the various issues?

[22:57] <lizmat> I think that would be a good idea
