[00:15] <arkiuat> argh, more noise on PR #4718; I forgot that a new commit would automatically attach to my most recent open PR, so I backed that out until I know better what I'm doing, and won't resubmit it until the old PR is closed. (Was trying to start the PR for issue #3881 on leap seconds.)

[14:29] <arkiuat> [Coke], I rephrased the code example in the gist so that it shows aligned columns without violating the comment-formatting rules.

[14:30] <arkiuat> so we won't need to have that separate discussion about NL vs actual newlines

[14:47] <[Coke]> cool

[14:47] <[Coke]> anything ready for merging?

[15:00] <arkiuat> yes, I think PR #4718 is ready for merging

[15:01] <arkiuat> when I started pushing commits on the leap-second issue, they automatically attached to 4718, so I'm holding off until that one is closed one way or the other

[15:01] <arkiuat> I guess this is what I should be using distinct branches for, huh

[15:01] <[Coke]> ... if you use the same branch, that'll happen

[15:01] <[Coke]> Yes.

[15:02] <arkiuat> right, gotcha. I was trying to fall back and simplify my usage because I had been getting confused with the more elaborate setup, and this has been educational!

[15:03] <arkiuat> so I'll starting naming distinct branches again, without trying to have a triangular remote set-up (at least not yet, anyway)

[16:15] <[Coke]> would it be easier to give you commit bits but still review prs?

[16:15] <[Coke]> Happy to do so

[16:39] <arkiuat> I'm actually not sure. It would probably speed up my learning curve though, so I'm inclined to say yes

[17:15] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/Raku/doc/pull/4720

[17:17] <arkiuat> I just tried creating a branch and checking in the changes for issue 3881 for it, BUT the new pull request that was created included all the main-branch commits for the old PR

[17:17] <arkiuat> so I closed the new PR right away. I don't think I can move forward until we deal with PR #4718, but I won't be making this particular mistake again

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: 

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: emit and done use control exceptions so you don't have to lexically

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: place them inside a react or supply block.

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: Also mention the LAST phaser in whenver blocks

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: is like the done named argument to method tap.

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: 

[17:33] <Geth> ¦ doc/sub-done-and-emit-clarifications: Also, calling &done will return from the supply or react block.

[17:42] <timo> oops, i think that needs an additional change to account for a change in 6.d

[17:43] <timo> no, i misread something that was only about whenever blocks themselves

[19:24] <arkiuat>  timo, yep, [Coke] and I had already discussed that. I had gotten myself all tangled up trying to set up a triangular remote workflow, and in falling back from that and simplifying, I forgot that I still need to name branches

[19:24] <arkiuat> won't be doing that again

[19:24] <arkiuat> thanks

[19:25] <arkiuat> anyway, I seem to have gotten that all cleared up and the newest PR is done properly
