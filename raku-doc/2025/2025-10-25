[17:16] <ds7832> I'm thinking about rearranging the first five subsections sections in http://docs.raku.org/language/quoting#Escaping:_q . The first few are already arranged quite nicely: Q, then q, then qq; i.e. beginning with the elementary and then growing. However the next section is "Word quoting: qw". I would rename it to "Word splitting: Qw and qw". This because I think "word splitting" expresses the actual effect of the :w quite nicely (

[17:17] <ds7832> whereas I find "word quoting" rather confusing, since the behavior of quotes is *not* affected), and because beginning with Qw should make it clearer what it is that :w does (since in qw, it's mixed with the effect of q).

[17:17] <ds7832> The section thereafter "Word quoting: < >", would then also need to be adapted.

[17:20] <ds7832> Likewise, the next section, "Word quoting with quote protection: qww", I would rename to "Word splitting with effectful quotes: Qww and qqw". This because I think "effectful quotes" expresses more clearly which change is broulght in by :ww (whereas "quote protection" is ambiguous, as it somewhat sounds as if it meant that the quoting marks were being protected, i.e. taken literally).

[17:23] <ds7832> However , since in practice qw and qww are mostly used (rather than Qw and Qww), I'm not entirely sure if it's that good an idea to begin with the Q forms rather than the q forms. Perhaps a good solution is to *begin* with them (to show what a "pure" :w or :ww does), but then make almost all of the succeeding examples about the q forms.

[17:24] <ds7832> Correction: it's more like the first 9 or so subsections, not just the first 5.

[17:25] <ds7832> What do you all think?

[17:26] <ds7832> Also, the subsection "Word quoting: < >" might be renamed to "Word splitting with Allomorph construction: < >".

[17:28] <ds7832> Likewise, "Word quoting with interpolation and quote protection: « »" would then have to be renamed tho "Word splitting with interpolation, effectful quotes, and Allomorph construction: « »"  -- That might be a bit much though (but on the other hand, if read from top to bottom, it makes good sense as being the top of a kind of ascension)

[17:47] <ds7832> Furthermore, and independent of all that: I think that in most examples like «say qw{"a b" c}.raku;», one should instead use ".say for qw["a b"c]». This because this will put each entry on its own line, which makes it clearly visible where the resulting strings are split and what their contents are (unlike the .raku output, which looks like «("\"a", "b\"", "c")␤»)

[18:05] <ds7832> Regarding my first message of this series: Another option would be to rename "Word quoting: qw" to "Word splitting: C<:w>". And correspondingly rename "Word quoting with quote protection: qww" to "Word splitting with effectful quotes: C<:ww>".

[18:05] <ds7832> I think that's preferable
