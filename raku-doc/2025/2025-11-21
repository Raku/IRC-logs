[13:57] <arkiuat> [Coke] and yes, that's an accurate description of my most recent mistake, but I think I've got things set up properly now

[14:05] <arkiuat> I just yesterday discovered https://github.com/Raku/doc/milestones 

[14:05] <arkiuat> I guess this hasn't been updated recently, but it's useful to have a distinction drawn between milestone issues and backlog issues

[16:52] *** finanalyst joined
[18:17] <arkiuat> the very first code example in the section https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction#Failures_and_exceptions actually fails for me when I run it, although the documentation there says that it won't fail

[18:55] <lizmat> yeah, that example is bogus

[18:55] <lizmat> completely bogus

[18:56] <lizmat> if assumes that you can iterate over the eigenstates of a Junction: well, you can't

[18:58] <lizmat> "That is what we do in the loop that runs over the elements of the junction, adding them to a list only if they are defined."   is bogus

[18:58] <lizmat> arkiuat [Coke] ^^

[18:59] <lizmat> fwiw, that's why I made https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/eigenstates

[19:16] <arkiuat> lizmat, thanks! I guess we should rewrite that part of the doc then

[19:21] <lizmat> I was thinking about an alternative, but sadly it's pretty hard

[19:21] <lizmat> all I could come up with is:

[19:21] <lizmat> m: my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1"; say $j ~~ Failure

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6d8be9959: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:23] <arkiuat> well, that's better than having confidently stated falsehoods in the docs

[19:27] <arkiuat> especially when we're talking about Junctions, which are already confusing enough to most people without this kind of shenanigans

[19:33] <arkiuat> yeah, I see https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3030 was opened for this exact section of the doc (but with an earlier version of this example) in 2019, and JJ wrote this new version (which apparently worked back then?) in response. But now JJ's version is failing. Huh.

[19:34] <lizmat> I think Junctions iterated before Xmas (as in before 6.c was released in 2015)...   so not sure what was going on here

[19:40] <arkiuat> I left a comment on issue #3030 suggesting either reopening it or making a new issue. JJ seemed to think this all had something to do with AUTOTHREAD, as he opened an issue to document it better (mentioning #3030), and the one is stil open

[19:40] <arkiuat> s/the/that/

[19:50] <lizmat> Ah... ok   hmmm

[19:51] <lizmat> m: my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1"; sub check($_} { say "Failure" when Failure }; check $j

[19:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6d8be9959: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed parameter␤at <tmp>:1␤------> not a number", "42", "2.1"; sub check($_<HERE>} { say "Failure" when Failure }; check ␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[19:51] <lizmat> meh

[19:52] <lizmat> yeah, that's not going to work, as the Failure will fire if passed as an argument

[20:08] <[Coke]> milestones date from when I was much more ambituous about getting things done

[20:09] <[Coke]> but yes, if you focus on things with a milestone, that's probably better than things in the backlog bucket.

[20:09] <[Coke]> ... but on the gripping hand, a ticket closed is a ticket I don't need to worry about

[21:29] <timo> m: my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1"; sub check(Any $_) { say "Failure" when Failure }; check $j

[21:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6d8be9959: OUTPUT: «Failure␤»

[21:29] <timo> the failure does not fire when passing it

[22:26] <arkiuat> timo, do you think your snippet would make a good replacement for that code sample in the docs?

[22:26] <arkiuat> [Coke], gotcha. I was pleased to see that #3881 was in the milestone bucket and not the backlog one

[22:49] <timo> hm, no don't think it should go in the docs

[22:49] <timo> i merely wanted to correct lizmat's last eval

[22:54] <[Coke]> I went through the list, made two new milestones (one for end of year, one for 2026-Q1), and moved some stuff around

[22:56] <[Coke]> (and kept that one in the current bucket!)

[22:56] <[Coke]> er, the bucket that is current, not the previous old bucket. :)

[23:29] <lizmat> m: my $j = +any "not a number", "42", "2.1"; sub check($value) { say "Failure" if $value ~~ Failure }; check $j    # looks like $_ is default Mu, using any other variable also works

[23:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6d8be9959: OUTPUT: «Failure␤»
