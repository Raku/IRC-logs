[17:15] <japhb> Welcome to the channel, holyghost 

[17:17] *** holly joined
[17:19] <holyghost> nice a gamedev channel

[17:19] <holyghost> I'm writing these thinbs

[17:20] <holyghost> s/thinbs/things

[17:20] <holyghost> I'm on weekend now though

[17:20] <holyghost> I have to watch out for burnouts

[17:20] <holyghost> got many admin friends with the same problem

[17:21] <holyghost> Will support some more to these next week

[17:21] <holyghost> I'm in the middle of writing an adventure game kit

[17:21] <holyghost> Game::Adventure

[17:21] <holyghost> needs refactoring though

[17:22] <holyghost> maybe an MVC and so on, I need an API for it

[17:22] <holyghost> now it's just a loop system with update and blit rounds

[17:23] <holyghost> collisions are not filled in, but it 's usable

[17:23] <holyghost> you can write LSL in it if you like

[17:24] <holyghost> just override and cas-and-paste

[17:24] <holyghost> s/cas-/case-

[17:24] <holyghost> I'll talk more about it next week

[17:24] <holyghost> API ideas are welcome then

[17:24] <holyghost> SFY
