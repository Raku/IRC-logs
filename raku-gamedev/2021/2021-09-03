[08:33] <holyghost> I've uploaded v0.1.4 of Game::Quest, should be functional now if you overridethe layer and room and the Quest class.

[08:33] <holyghost> *player

[08:33] <holyghost> Later on I'll do the text/keyboard interface

[08:36] <holyghost> Each room should have a collision detection method that goes into Quest.pm6 to put the player update system on noupdate

[08:39] <holyghost> player.move-not;

[13:38] <holyghost> Game::Quest v0.1.5 has  been uploaded, there's a text lookup system in now such as "look at" and "body" targets something in a matrix

[13:39] <holyghost> A loop object for in-game films e.g. if you kneel and pick something up

[13:39] <holyghost> is in also

[13:40] <holyghost> I didn't make examples in the package as that is left to the reader and does not clutter up the files

[13:45] <holyghost> each room then gets a BAM (bi-assoc matrix) system where you can "look at", "search", etc. in a small parser
