[05:10] <youssefx> uhhh

[05:10] <youssefx> hi?

[05:10] <moon-child> youssefx: sup

[05:10] <youssefx> oh shoot this is a thing 

[05:10] <youssefx> and there's real people here?

[05:11] <youssefx> i feel like

[05:11] <moon-child> possibly even more than one!

[05:11] <youssefx> i discovered a weird spot in the internet 

[05:11] <youssefx> like

[05:11] <youssefx> a place on the internet that feels more real than most places on the internet 

[05:11] <youssefx> does that makes sense?

[05:12] <youssefx> because now adays, the internet is just a few big sites that dominate most of the world's users, but now, i found this weird service on my OS that i think very few people in the world know

[05:13] <youssefx> and thus, it feels more internety than most internet places 

[05:13] <youssefx> sorry if i am weirding you out lol

[05:14] <youssefx> it's been such a long ass time since i touched a computer too

[05:14] <youssefx> i just got out of bootcamp, MCT, and now im in my school house

[05:14] <youssefx> i *just* got my laptop
