[04:46] <holly_> ok, I got that stupid UTF8 thing figured out

[04:46] <holly_> bot is up and ready to code on

[04:47] <holly_> sorry for the flood

[04:48] <holly_> I made it so it only prints ascii, the topic made it parse utf-8 code which is out of range for a simple terminal

[04:48] <holly_> (and locale)

[04:49] <holly_> I am going to make something out of it for this channel, not too stupid I hope :-)

[04:49] <holly_> bots are daft sometimes

[04:50] <holly_> That way I can hack something else than games

[04:56] <moon-child> why can't it handle utf8?

[04:56] <holly_> because I do not have that locale in xterm

[04:56] <holly_> nor in xterm-utf8

[04:57] <moon-child> wait so xterm crashed because the bot printed out utf8?

[04:57] <holly_> python did

[04:57] <holly_> it handles utf of course

[04:57] <holly_> but not on my terminal

[04:57] <moon-child> ah, huh

[04:58] <holly_> I get a string which only gets printed on my terminal if it's plain ascii

[04:59] <holly_> if it's utf I cannot print it and it does not either

[04:59] <holly_> that was the bug for a non-stupid term irc bot

[04:59] <holly_> else I have to put that in the docs or something

[05:02] <holly_> anyway, now I have to think of functionality

[05:03] <holly_> I am not going to do a full natural language parsing as it's too much work

[05:11] <holly_> it just says hello now :-)

[10:52] <jjatria> japhb: are you thinking of a MUGS talk at the Raku conference by any chance? I'm trying to decide whether I should have a sort of progress report on Pop

[18:36] <japhb> When is it?

[19:18] <holly_> I just finished the chapter on noinformative priors, it learned me very nice things about prediction. Game::Decion and Game::Bayes will benefit

[19:18] <holly_> *Game::Decision

[19:20] <holly_> basically you make means about variables with max likelihood and max entropy so you have 2 potentials which derives into the prediction of a value

[19:20] <holly_> It's very elegant as maximum entropy is very common in machine learning, AI etc.

[19:21] <holly_> I am going to start tonight on AI-NLP (AI::NLP) NLP === Natural Language Processing. It can be useful for an IRC bot

[19:22] <holly_> It's a grand hack though if I finish it

[19:23] <holly_> For hacking on something else than the above Bayesian analysis for Game::X

[19:24] <holly_> As both AFAIK need a lot of work

[19:25] <holly_> Problem is you can always add stats methods (e.g. with random  functionality) but the whole package is done for then

[19:26] <holly_> NLP has lots of apps but also nice for terminal interface of e.g. KQ4 (king's quest 4)

[19:26] <holly_> "ask about healer" such things

[19:27] <holly_> which is done with a bi-associative matrix or fuzzy associative matrix

[19:28] <holly_> (in those games)

[19:30] <holly_> which is just row : "ask about" column : "healer", "fox", etc.

[19:30] <holly_> Space Quest is also done that way

[19:31] <holly_> so matrix["ask about"]["healer"] ==> "the healer is making potions"

[19:31] <holly_> as I said, I'm getting old :-)

[19:33] <holly_> First thing is to make a ANN (Artificial Neural Network) then elevate that for NLP

[19:34] <holly_> Which I know by heart but not the deep learning for NLP, that's past the 90ies

[19:35] <holly_> (or 40ies for an ANN)

[19:41] <holly_> anyway, I'll return in a few hours, I hope I have something by tomorrow morning but I need to read also

[22:32] <holly_> I've started on AI-NLP, as I'm too tired it's just matrix and vector for now. I just uploaded it

[22:56] <holly_> I also have to read up on it, as it's not just a backpropagation ANN
