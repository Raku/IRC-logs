[12:53] <holyghost> I've programmed a Titus the Fox demo, where you can jump on enemies and move around the room

[12:53] <holyghost> Then I took out the room and entity classes and started on a space quest

[12:54] <holyghost> Both were coded in python on windows 7

[12:55] <holyghost> Next I will try to make some rooms for the games (levels)

[12:56] <holyghost> If all goes well, I'll code something up in raku next week again

[12:56] <holyghost> something game related

[12:58] <holyghost> I cannot give them away as both games are copyrighted, I might put something online without the graphics though

[12:59] <holyghost> wait a mintue

[12:59] <holyghost> *minute

[13:02] <holyghost> There they are ^^ :-)

[13:03] <holyghost> Don't tell it was holly ! :-)

[13:05] <holyghost> you may adapt them e.g. to perl6 or something, they're BSD licensed for "good" measure

[13:08] <holyghost> s/perl6/raku

[13:08] <holyghost> These are just for our crew

[14:00] <holyghost> Again, if you want to use the above software (I got a complaint for sharing) change the name titus to something else in the code and do not use the graphics

[14:00] <holyghost> the jumping algorithm (as in super mario bros.) is free

[14:01] <holyghost> So then you have a  more regular platform game

[14:01] <holyghost> I'm sorry

[14:02] <holyghost> AFAIK you do not have to have a license for a platform game with jumping on enemies

[14:02] <holyghost> Lots of those for free in your ACME store

[14:04] <holyghost> I've just started on a quest system for old sierra games in raku, I will make a free version of the game where no one has a hassle

[14:05] <holyghost> Also, note the BSD license that comes with the program

[14:31] <holyghost> Game::Quest has been uploaded

[14:32] <holyghost> game kit for old sierra adventure games

[14:32] <holyghost> (just started nothing functional yet

[14:33] <holyghost> )

[14:35] <holyghost> I will add player and non-player entities later on. As well as a room system.

[14:37] <holyghost> Scrips for geenrating things should become easy

[14:37] <holyghost> *generating

[14:59] <holyghost> I've put in a Room, ImageLibrary (for getting image loops e.g. for walking) and an Entiy (v0.1.2)

[15:01] <holyghost> *Entity

[15:35] <japhb> Moving right along, it sounds like.  :-)

[15:39] <holyghost> :-)

[15:40] <holyghost> I've put v0.1.3 online, has a player class which can move under keyboard controls

[15:40] <holyghost> _can_

[15:41] <holyghost> SFY

[15:41] * holyghost is going to rest for a while

[15:43] <holyghost> I'll continue onit later on, should be made in a jiffy

[15:44] <holyghost> demos maybe, but needs more room stuff

[15:44] <holyghost> anyway, I'm off, I'll comment on it more tomorrow
