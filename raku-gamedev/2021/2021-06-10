[00:29] <holly_> There's Game::Numeric now

[00:30] <holly_> last version is not yet public

[00:30] <holly_> Then I'll work on Game::Decision more which now has nice utility and standard loss functions

[00:31] <holly_> these things can be used to calculate a risk or loss

[00:31] <holly_> on a real world problem, real "values" as probability distributions

[00:32] <moon-child> holly_: I'm surprised you didn't use grammars for the FunctionParser

[00:32] <holly_> I know

[00:32] <holly_> It's just a fast hack now

[00:33] <holly_> so I can work on with the call-function method

[00:33] <holly_> regexes should also be in order

[00:33] <holly_> I'm a lost soul for now on grammars

[00:33] <holly_> and I still need to read more

[00:34] <holly_> Lots of stress lately, I'm on page 82 of the book which is in Game::Decision

[00:34] <holly_> Bayesian analysis will come

[00:36] <holly_> anyhow, I just quit hacking, so I'm going to rest in half an hour

[12:16] <holly_> Game::Decision 0.1.4 is uploaded, now I need to put more "real" tests in it. Apparently Game::Bayes works again as Game-Decision depends on Game-Stats and Game-Bayes

[12:16] <holly_> Game-Stats has a small update

[12:17] <holly_> AFAIK I'll try it without prove6

[12:18] <holly_> docs will be coming later on

[12:18] <holly_> the code is commented if you like

[12:18] <holly_> ok, I'm a bit afk

[12:35] *** holly_ left

[14:00] <holly_> Everything is documented now, Game-Stats,Game-Bayes,Game-Decision and Game-Numeric all contain up to date pod6's

[14:01] <holly_> These docs should make it easy to use the kits

[14:39] <japhb> Go holly_ go ...  :-)

[14:59] <holly_> ... _holly be good :-)

[15:43] <holly_> ok, I'm off, enjoy the docs. Maybe I'll add some more tests tonight but everything is up to date with my reading. CYA!
