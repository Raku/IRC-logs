[10:12] <holly__> Now there's a nice integral of squared-error loss in Game::Numeric, it can be used to predict random variables (see Game-Decision)

[10:12] <holly__> Uploaded today

[10:13] <holly__> Now I need to debug both and more or less add tests

[10:14] <holly__> There's just simple tests now in Numeric and Decision

[10:14] <holly__> So I have 3 standard loss functions

[10:15] <holly__> S/So/So now

[10:16] <holly__> S/So/So now

[10:16] <holly__> *barf* stupid irc client

[10:17] <Altreus> holly__: I wanna read your stuff but there's a lot. What's the sort of ... entrypoint module in all of this? :D

[10:18] <holly__> Game::Stats is very basic statistics, then Game-Numeric is standalone numerical functions (integrals for decision theory)

[10:19] <holly__> Then Game::Bayes is bayesian statistics extended and Game::Decision is what you have to read last, decision theory based on the 3 other packages

[10:20] <holly__> There's some design faults as I forgot some things in Game::Bayes

[10:20] <holly__> *blush*

[10:20] <holly__> Game-Stats contains discrete distribution functionality

[10:21] <holly__> So a Game::Stats::DistributionPopulation contains just a list of chances

[10:21] <holly__> This is basically needed for calculating estimates, variances etc.

[10:22] <holly__> This is called a distribution in statistics

[10:22] <holly__> (Discrete)

[10:23] <holly__> Game-Bayes needs more work so you just have some brute MAP learning and that's it for now, all based on the disrtibutionpopulation of Game-Stats ^^

[10:23] <holly__> Then Numeric speaks for itself, definite integrals for the bayesian analysis

[10:24] <holly__> Then decision theory is quite nice in Game::Decision as you have several loss and risk functions which can be used in "Game"'s

[10:24] <holly__> Decision theory is loss and risk functionality

[10:25] <holly__> So you get fractions/probabilities with rewards and so on to calculate potentials (with integrals)

[10:25] <holly__> These things are needed for adaptive systems

[10:26] <holly__> To be more informative : Game-Decision is the best to learn in the end as it has clear game functionality, don't mind the dependencies as they are simple

[10:27] <holly__> Now TBH it's just a main pattern class with math function all the time, for speed instead of OOP

[10:27] <holly__> These things are faster than non-core/core dispatches

[10:27] <holly__> HTH

[10:28] <Altreus> I see I see

[10:29] <Altreus> I forgot I asked a question in IRC but I appreciate that you answered thoroughly anyway :D

[10:29] <Altreus> Means I can digest it when I can manage

[10:29] <holly__> Sure, take care

[10:37] <holly__> In Game::Decision is an algorithm for 3 rewards r1 << r3 << r2, << == preferred over

[10:38] <holly__> That's also usable in games then there's just loss functions

[10:38] <holly__> These 2 are the basics of the whole system

[10:38] <holly__> Risk functions will come later together with Bayesian analysis which is for e.g. inference

[10:39] * holly__ needs to finish his book chapter

[10:39] <holly__> (About non-informative priors now)

[10:43] <holly__> These things will need more time as I have to understand the CS features of the noninformative priors

[10:43] <holly__> I need Haar measures and Fischer info matrices

[10:44] <holly__> Which probably will bootstrap Game::Matrix etc.

[10:46] <holly__> To conclude, if you understand the functionality of Game-Decision you'll be ok, the 3 dependencies are to be comprehended but are more easy

[10:47] <holly__> And for games pretty simple to use as they are just statistics and small functionality

[11:38] <holly__> I am going to stop working on my Game:: libraries for this week

[11:40] <holly__> I'll rejoin on sunday

[11:40] <holly__> Evrything should be online in 6-12 hours

[11:40] <holly__> bye!
