[00:41] <japhb> jjatria: Are there any widget libraries for SDL?  In other words, if we want a menu or select list or progress bar or such, are there prebuilt libraries that everyone uses, or does everyone just write their own from scratch?

[00:46] <moon-child> people use dear imgui and nuklear pretty frequently.  Those slot into opengl rather than sdl directly.  But if you use sdl_gpu, you can get most of the same drawing primitives implemented explicitly using opengll

[00:46] <moon-child> so I would go that route if you want to use a preexisting library

[00:47] <moon-child> ('most of the same drawing primitives'--that plain sdl provides)

[01:53] <japhb> moon-child: Ah, thank you.

[01:54] * japhb has the distinct feeling he's going to have to invent a markup language for default UI components, for people who don't want to make a full UI from scratch ...

[18:29] <jjatria> Welp, I just did the first run of my talk, and I finished with a whole 2 seconds to spare. Might have to cut some things to be safe ðŸ’¦ 

[19:06] <japhb> Depends on whether you want to guarantee question time or just hope that speed up from being live makes it happen.

[20:08] <jjatria> I felt like some parts were a little disconnected, so I'm probably going to have to add some connecting tissue

[20:11] <jjatria> I did manage to squeeze in a slide with a video showing the system in motion, which is nice: https://jjatria.gitlab.io/discoverability-composability/#/80

[21:57] <japhb> NICE!
