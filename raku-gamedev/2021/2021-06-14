[09:01] <Altreus> I discovered that I do actually have Into The Breach

[11:54] *** holly_ joined
[13:18] <jjatria> Excellent game. Bonus points for in-world explanations of game mechanics

[13:24] <Altreus> Games with "just figure it out" tutorials that actually work get a lot of brownie points

[14:22] <holly_> Would there be interest in making a raku freecol or freeciv ? Which would give us a hacking project together.

[14:22] <holly_> http://freecol.org http://freeciv.org

[14:23] * holly_ is getting old :-)

[14:27] <Altreus> As much as I have reverence for these classics I feel like libraries that are only ever developed with these things in mind will never be suitable for modern games

[15:13] <holly_> Ok, I'll start on it on my own then, I'll keep it modular so there can be features of the game(s)

[15:13] <holly_> The graphics and its engine should be something for later on 

[15:14] <holly_> The modules can then be used to build such a game out of it as A. said

[15:15] <holly_> I'll start on it tonight, now a bit of rest. CUL
