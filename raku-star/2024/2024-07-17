[10:57] <tbrowder> i want to port my modules to windows and also help others do so. a debian friend suggests the best experience is to use an older windows version. any idea of the oldest windows version that can support rakudo?

[11:47] <tbrowder> i'm now looking at Win 7 Pro as available and remember it was a pretty solid windows version.
