[18:43] <AntonOks> Hi all. Nice to see some community members seem to be interested in "STAR modules" :)

[18:43] <AntonOks> First off, thanks to tbrowder__ for the idea and initiative for a dedicated STAR IRC channel... and also BIG thanks to lizmat for making it happen!

[18:47] <AntonOks> Beside this IRC channel, I've also enabled the "[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rakudo/star/discussions)" now... that's hopefully attracting community members, which do not use IRC much (like myself :O  )

[18:48] <AntonOks> lizmat : maybe you can spread the word in the next "weekly"?! THANKS!
