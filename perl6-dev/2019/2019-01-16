[09:11] <patrickb> So, the gsoc mentor organisation applications are open for real now. (https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

[09:12] <patrickb> I have taken a look at how this works in general. First thing needed is a so called Organization Administrator. That's the one person that has the last call on most gsoc matters and also the one google contacts should the need arise.

[09:12] <patrickb> I think it's important the org admin has some esteem in the community.

[09:13] <patrickb> It seems the last gsoc perl participated in was 2014: https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/tpf

[09:14] <patrickb> mst: I think you have been involved in past gsocs. In your opinion, does it make more sense to keep perl 5 and 6 separate wrt to gsoc or try to cooperate and apply as a single organization?

[10:55] <nine> patrickb: just wanted to mention, that I feel your pain WRT library paths in rakudo: https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl6/commit/f1c17179d6e837a78b4282dd14379102f5e1bc15

[11:00] <releasable6> Next release in â‰ˆ3 days and â‰ˆ7 hours. 5 blockers. Please log your changes in the ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[11:02] <patrickb> nine: The approach I'm taking in my relocatable refactor is to introduce the concept of an nqp_home and perl6_home. Those point to share/nqp and share/perl6 respectively. Do you think this is the best approach? The code you just linked seems to indicate one is sometimes interested in setting only the lib dir and not the entire nqp/perl6 dir.

[11:11] *** lizmat left
[11:55] <nine> patrickb: Linux distros usually don't like binaries in /usr/share. That's why the openSUSE packages for nqp set --libdir=/usr/lib64. We actually should do something similar with other precomp files

[12:41] <patrickb> nine: They put the actual .moarvm files directly in /usr/lib64? That changes things. Ugh.

[12:49] <patrickb> The rakudo package on the other hand was left in tact. It even puts its nqp files in /usr/share/nqp/lib/perl6

[12:59] <patrickb> nine: That means the idea of an nqp_home is dead.

[13:03] <patrickb> AFAIK the share/perl6 folder only contains three compunit repos (/, /site, and /vendor) and an empty /lib folder. Does that mean the share/perl6 folder in its entirety would be moved to /usr/lib64? Or would it be taken apart?

[13:04] <patrickb> I fear the idea of a perl6_home with a fixed directory layout might also be unrealistic. :-(

[13:48] <nine> patrickb: yeah, these issues are _hard_ :/

[13:49] *** pmurias left
[13:49] <nine> patrickb: I actually think that even /usr/lib64 is the wrong directory as the .moarvm and precomp files are not architecture dependent. So /usr/lib seems to be the most appropriate

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: ooh gsoc, it would be lovely to make it happen

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: maybe [Coke] ?

[14:08] <patrickb> nine: The worst that can happen is that we have no guarantees about directory layout at all. Then, I think, the best we can do is to add three configuration options: 1. flat list of all libdirs, 2. flat list of comp repos, 3. path to main file (either perl6.moarvm or perl6-debug.moarvm).

[14:16] <patrickb> nine: I'll write some thoughts up on what approaches there might be. It'd be great if you could then have a look and give an opinion.

[14:25] <nine> patrickb: sure. Just keep in mind that I'm on vacation next week starting on Sunday and don't know how much time I'll have till then. So if you don't get any feedback in this time, that's why

[14:27] <patrickb> nine: ok. OOC do you plan to go to FOSDEM this year?

[15:21] <pmurias> 'use lib' is making tests fail in precompilation mode

[15:22] <pmurias> what do we want to do about that?

[15:23] <pmurias> nine: is there a fundamental reason why 'use lib' doesn't work in precompilation mode or is it just unimplemented yet?

[15:36] <nine> patrickb: FOSDEM, yes :)

[15:39] <nine> pmurias: use lib changes the repository chain and therefore invalidates the dependency resolutions. This makes things quite complicated. We were extremely strict about it initially and IIRC we relaxed that somewhat
