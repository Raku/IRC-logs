[12:56] <[Tux]> jjmerelo: the test-t is (for me) the most interesting one, and as nine said csv-test-xs-20 it the only perl5 one, the rest is perl6

[12:56] <tellable6> [Tux], I'll pass your message to jjmerelo

[15:12] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/92648e4a71

[15:59] <bartolin> it looks like this line (and the one above) is outdated now that we have CORE.c.setting, etc.: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core.c/Backtrace.pm6#L69

[16:01] <bartolin> it makes one spectest fail for the JVM backend: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S32-basics/warn.t#L46

[16:03] <bartolin> (but that test passes for moar)

[16:05] <bartolin> I'm wondering if replacing the 'ends-with' with a match like $!file ~~ / "CORE." <[ c .. z ]> ".setting" $ / (for the JVM backend) would be good enough for now.

[16:24] <vrurg> bartolin: it must be a match, to my view.

[16:27] <bartolin> vrurg: so the naming schema is stable now (I didn't follow the latest changes closely)?

[16:28] <vrurg> bartolin: it's not 100% guaranteed as AlexDaniel prposes using full versions instead of just revisions. But his proposal is accepted I've no idea how long would it take to actually implement.

[16:29] <vrurg> bartolin: In either case, `CORE.\w+.setting` (roughly) must be good enough. I don't think anything would change beyond v6c instead of just 'c'

[16:30] <bartolin> vrurg: thanks. I'll spectest a patch if no one beats me to it.

[16:32] <vrurg> bartolin: make a PR, request a review. Then there be two people to be beaten. ;)

[16:33] <bartolin> *g*

[18:36] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: will your pr work on previous rakudo versions? ( https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/237#issuecomment-526931096 )

[18:37] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I don't think it's my PR.

[18:38] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: oh yeah, right :)

[18:38] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I meant https://github.com/bduggan/p6-grammar-prettyerrors/pull/1

[18:39] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: ah, yes. Tested back to 2019.03.1

[18:40] <AlexDaniel> nice

[18:40] <vrurg> Basically, if it won't work then something is funamentally wrong with Backtrace. 

[18:41] <vrurg> And, BTW, if I don't forget doing so, an ticket on docs is needed for perl5 -> perl6 section. Backtrace must be mentioned alongside with callframe and even be the recommended way.
