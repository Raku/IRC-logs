[09:20] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: my laptop short circuted last night and I'll be waiting at least a week or maybe even 2 for a replacement so those Blin tests might not happen regularly until then since SSH is not fun on my cellphone :(

[09:30] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: I guess life just decided that you need more adventures :)

[09:30] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: it's ok, thanks for letting me know!

[12:54] <pamplemousse> vrurg: Where is nqp::loadbytecodefh getting used that you're seeing and having the issue with?

[13:15] <vrurg> pamplemousse: CompUnit::Load. R#3075

[13:15] <synopsebot> R#3075 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3075 [precompilation] Conflicting use statement does not produce an error, but fails dynamic compilation.

[13:16] <vrurg> I didn't manage to golf the case down to something smaller.

[13:45] <pamplemousse> vrurg: Yeah, the whole precompilation loading process is pretty massive and icky to trace through. I was tracing through something similar the other day, let me see if I can find it and I'll get back to you 

[13:46] <vrurg> pamplemousse: thanks! 

[13:49] * vrurg remembers scared jnthn's reaction to a precompilation problem... :)

[13:51] <[Coke]> docs are complaining about 'composalizer' coming in as a method name (from nqp)... this seems like a made up word; any reason why it isn't "composer" ?

[13:53] <[Coke]> docs *spelling* test, to be clear.

[13:55] <timotimo> i think it's a thing that makes something composable?

[13:55] <timotimo> so it's a second-order composer?

[14:03] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: replacement laptop ordered! Should be with me early next week and we can back to taking over the universe

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: well, that was quick :)

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: normally I'd be choosing for weeks and hating every single available option

[14:03] <timotimo> deciding for what you want is the hardest part

[14:04] <kawaii> I had to uhm, beg a family member for emergency laptop money, but yes I needed one ASAP really

[14:04] <kawaii> My laptop was my only other device other than my cellphone, so quite important I have one

[14:05] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: they are on the expensive side but I highly recommend System76 if you want a good Linux laptop, my last two came from there

[14:06] <timotimo> but the last one broke :) :)

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> meh, I've been on used thinkpads for the last few years, it works for me

[14:07] <kawaii> timotimo: let's go with, died from abuse from it's owner instead of 'broke'

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> currently on x230, and every newer model is worse than the previous one, so…

[14:07] <kawaii> I ran Blin on it more times than I should have probably

[14:08] <timotimo> maybe one of those laptop stands that have extra cooling built in would be good for this purpose :)

[14:08] <kawaii> 100% investing in one of those now

[14:08] <kawaii> and also some premium thermal paste

[14:08] <timotimo> if that was even related to the problem

[14:08] <kawaii> For sure it was

[14:08] <timotimo> minty toothpaste makes the whole room smell nice

[14:09] <kawaii> I agree!

[14:09] <timotimo> when used as thermal paste, even more so

[14:09] <timotimo> though you can probably find cheaper devices to heat up some toothpaste than a full laptop

[14:10] <kawaii> I think the stock paste they used was cheap stuff, I peeled back the heatsinks from the CPU and GPU and it was little more than powdered dust 

[14:10] <kawaii> Completely dry

[14:12] <AlexDaniel> maybe we should set up a dedicated blinputer

[14:13] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: I'm hoping to get one of those HP microservers in my new apartment in a few months so...

[14:13] <AlexDaniel> kinda a longstanding issue, actually… would be nice to have something that crunches module tests all the time instead of having someone manually run it

[14:15] <timotimo> i have a nice little passively-cooled industrial PC thingie

[14:15] <timotimo> it's got a whoopin 1.6ghz i think

[14:28] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: got your note on #perl6. BTW, doesn't jnthn must approve the assignment?

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: that's correct, we'll try to discuss how it'll work as soon as jnthn is a bit free-er

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: as I understand, you'll need to be added here under `language` https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/#labels-and-responsible-devs

[14:31] <vrurg> Ok, I'd postpone any actions until then.

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: which means that not only jnthn will have to approve it :)

[14:32] <vrurg> Sure!

[14:32] <vrurg> :)

[14:37] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: … which actions are we postponing exactly? :)

[14:38] <AlexDaniel> cuz that's definitely not something that should be happening :)

[14:40] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: like finding unlikely to be implemented/fossilized tests in roast, starting a release-preparation ticket, etc.

[14:41] <vrurg> Though tests could/should be done anyway. That mess needs some cleanup.

[14:42] *** squashable6 left
[14:42] <vrurg> afk

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> you can start doing that

[16:45] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I'm about to file a PR for the inclusion into the list. I think there must be a lablel named 'roast' or 'language release`.

[16:47] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: hmmm, `language` is roast

[16:47] <AlexDaniel> or what's the language then :)

[16:48] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: in the PR, include some info about yourself, not everyone is following the development so some might not know about your great contributions

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also, you probably want to add yourself both under a label and into the list of reviewers

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I think `language` is the right label, you and jnthn just need to figure out who will do what exactly

[16:52] <vrurg> The latter is the plan. With regard to the label: language is about the actual changes to the language and their approval. 'language release' or 'roast' for shortness is for technical or organisational matters related to the release itself.

[16:53] <vrurg> I also thought about putting 'roast' on approved changes to simplify tracking them.

[16:53] *** japhb joined
[16:54] <AlexDaniel> I understand what you're trying to say but I think it's the same thing :)

[16:55] <vrurg> Will see how it goes then. I just don't want people to think I'm the one to approve the actual changes. :)

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> I definitely wouldn't mind if you learned that too :)

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> does it hurt?

[17:20] <vrurg> Not really. As I think of it now, perhaps it's even for better as it promotes the resource.
