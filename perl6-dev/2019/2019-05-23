[00:28] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2915

[00:32] <vrurg> What would be the best way to declare a $? constant in a CORE.setting?

[00:35] <vrurg> Incomplete question. The constant value must depend on what CORE.<revision>.setting is loaded.

[11:45] <lizmat> jnthn: could this ever cause two different types being output:

[11:45] <lizmat> note object.^name;

[11:45] <lizmat>             nqp::bindattr(object,Profile::Object,'%!threads',%!threads);

[11:45] <lizmat> die object.^name;

[11:45] <lizmat> I get: Profile::Object and Hash

[11:47] <lizmat> looks like object becomes %!threads in this case

[11:47] <lizmat> that feels wrong to me

[12:13] <timotimo> bindattr returns the %!threads

[12:13] <timotimo> but it shouldn't change the object variable

[12:14] *** vrurg left
[12:26] <lizmat> that's what I thought

[12:27] <lizmat> I guess I should try to golf this and make it an issue  :-)

[12:27] <timotimo> can you gist up some more surrounding context?

[12:38] <jnthn> lizmat: Sure you dn't need to nqp::decont(object) in the bindattr?

[12:39] * lizmat checks

[12:41] <timotimo> it *should* complain about the attribute not matching up

[12:41] <timotimo> but it's possible that it somehow does typecheck correctly and ends up assigning %!threads into the same slot that the scalar has to store the contents

[12:41] <timotimo> that would explain how that weirdness could theoretically happen

[12:42] <lizmat> yeah, the decont fixes it, jnthn++

[20:08] <ugexe> seems like Telemetry and Profile should be combined. also it seems poor form to use `Profile` in the core -- its seems like a useful name to use outside of rakudo

[20:09] *** ufobat_ joined
[20:09] <timotimo> use Profile:auth<rakudo> :) :)

[20:10] <timotimo> well, at least Profile is kind of moarvm-centric; at the moment at least

[20:10] <lizmat> it is very MoarVM centric

[20:11] <lizmat> also: use in Perl 6 is lexical, so you can do a "use Profile" very locally

[20:11] <timotimo> i don't think that's what ugexe meant?

[20:11] <ugexe> whats important is what people use (which is not the full namespace) especially for core module names

[20:12] <ugexe> because an ntalled Profile will be before rakudos

[20:12] <timotimo> it's fine to have "use lib", because it's not likely anybody would build a "lib" themselves

[20:12] <ugexe> so behavior will change once a lib/Profile.pm6 is installed

[20:12] <lizmat> so what would be a good name ?

[20:12] <ugexe> and this *is* the purpose of auth of course. but im not sure auth<> is going to play well with core/dual life modules

[20:12] <timotimo> mhm

[20:13] <timotimo> Rakudo::Profiler could be okay?

[20:13] <timotimo> hm. what if we give it a lowercase name instead?

[20:13] <timotimo> normally modules you install have capitals in them

[20:13] <timotimo> but pragmata don't (except MONKEY-related ones)

[20:13] <ugexe> will it ever work with something other than MoarVM? if not then MoarVM::Profiler or MoarVMProfiler

[20:14] *** ufobat left
[20:14] <ugexe> if the intention is to work on other backends one day then Rakudo::Profiler or some such 

[20:14] <timotimo> it's theoretically possible to get some of the same info from other backends, but things like "how many calls happened into speshed code" don't make sense outside of moarvm

[20:14] <timotimo> and not all backends will actually have GC pauses, like a jvm with an incremental garbage collection strategy

[20:14] <lizmat> yeah... I think MoarVM::Profiler would be best then

[20:15] <lizmat> each backend can have its own  :-)

[20:15] <ugexe> even just `Profiler` is better than `Profile` imo

[20:15] <lizmat> MoarVM::Profiler then ?

[20:16] <ugexe> i wont complain as long as its not just `Profile`

[20:16] <timotimo> Proffile

[20:16] <lizmat> ShedColor::Profile  :-)

[20:16] <ugexe> pRoFiLe

[20:16] <lizmat> anyways, I'll make it MoarVM::Profiler

[20:17] <timotimo> hmm

[20:17] <timotimo> could be a good april first thing

[20:17] <timotimo> implementing a :shedcolor part of module identity

[20:17] <ugexe> m: use Test:shedcolor<Foo>; # :P
