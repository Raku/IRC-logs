[14:02] <nine> Cool! Calling P5 methods in scalar context really works :) And it doesn't look all that bad: $p5obj.some_method(Scalar, 1, 2, 3);

[14:04] <timotimo> oh, putting Scalar as the first argument will do that?

[14:04] <timotimo> that could be fun with flattening :o

[14:05] <nine> Yep, a Scalar type object. Something I've never seen in any non-core code

[14:05] <timotimo> true

[14:06] <timotimo> does p5 also have void/sink context?

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> nine: uh, I can't retest it on my systemâ€¦ I don't think the module works with the newest libfreetype6-dev debian package

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> nine: but it does work for you now, right?

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> I run Blin on another system so we'll see if it's not fixed anyway

[14:06] <nine> AlexDaniel: "work". I haven't seen the failures from the ticket, but do get other test failures unrelated to JIT

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> ohâ€¦

[14:06] <nine> timotimo: it does

[14:07] <timotimo> will you provide something for that as well?

[14:08] <nine> I guess I could. Have been thinking about using Mu as sentinel for that. But I guess the demand for this feature will be rather small

[16:12] <nine> timotimo: seems like supporting void context could win me another 7 % in csv-ip5xs.pl, so it might be worth it. I do wonder though if there'd be a way to get this win without having the user explicitly telling me?

[16:13] <timotimo> wow, cool

[16:14] <timotimo> don't think i know a way to get that

[16:15] <nine> The one change necessary in csv-ip5xs.pl would be: $csv.parse(Mu, $_);

[16:15] <nine> It doesn't look that bad, but also not as clear as the Scalar thing

[16:15] <timotimo> could have something like IterationEnd

[16:21] <nine> It's now taking a little over 14 seconds for 1_000_000 lines. I'm quite sure that when I started optimizing it took about 16 seconds for just 10_000

[16:22] <timotimo> very nice

[23:22] <timotimo> Font::FreeType just got a release which fixes t/10metrics_postscript.t for newer versions of freetype2; does that have anything to do with the CStruct change I made?
