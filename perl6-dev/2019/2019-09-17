[09:35] <lizmat> somehow I managed to screw up the Sprintf file *again*

[09:35] <lizmat> vrurg also complained about a busted branch pull

[09:35] <lizmat> it feels to me I'm not the only one suffering from this issue :-(

[09:41] <lizmat> and now making changes to a core.e file and doing a 'make install' does not recompile the setting or anything for that matter

[09:42] * lizmat feels very tired all of a sudden

[09:56] <lizmat> a reconfig while in the branch, seems to have created a workable situation

[11:26] <lizmat> m: sprintf("%+.0d",0)."foo"

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, you did it too early, I was looking for comments not for voting

[13:56] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I don't see 5th one in there. And there was enough comments in 101. I don't want a minor issue to pull back the main PR for so long. 

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> it's not exactly a minor issue

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> yeah, it's bikesheddable, but it's something that will directly affect everyone‚Ä¶

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> and if we somehow go with long versions, that could easily suck in the long run :)

[14:02] <jnthn> Also, it will take tools/editors time to update, and it's better if they know how to do that.

[14:03] <jnthn> I'm unamused by RealMedia. I previously checked out .rm and .rt and found both of *those* were used by it also.

[14:03] <vrurg> Ok, I missed the word 'comparatively' ‚Äì i.e. 'comparatively minor'. Anyway, 101 had enough of productive discussion too.

[14:06] <vrurg> Real assiciations are too strong. Could cause a lot of confusion especially on Windows for people trying to run something with a doubleclik.

[14:08] <jnthn> Do most windows users even have realplayer installed anymore? I've not come across anything in that format for years...

[14:08] <jnthn> Not to mention that you'd not run .ram anyway

[14:09] <jnthn> But rather, edit it

[14:09] <timotimo> fwiw, we already install .bat launchers when a module has a bin/ folder and is zef installed

[15:41] <nine> jnthn: am I doing something wrong or is there really quite a bit of breakage?

[15:42] <jnthn> nine: That looks bad.

[15:42] <jnthn> nine: No idea if it's a regression, or just an imporperly guarded mixin cache 

[15:43] <jnthn> Or at least, that'd be my first guess

[15:44] <nine> Despite the nice reproducibility it doesn't strike me as something that one would come across easily. So I guess it's an old bug not a regression.

[15:45] <jnthn> Yeah, probably

[15:45] <nine> I can also reproduce an STable with a broken HOW showing up in GC quite easily. It's always on a mixed in object

[17:01] <dogbert17> I guess it might help if we knew what code was running when the last GC occured

[17:09] <nine> I'm pretty sure its a missing write barrier

[17:10] *** robertle joined
[17:11] <vrurg> timotimo: it's not a makefile variable due to all that zoo of make utils we have on our hands. It's more reliable to just insert plain @.

[17:11] <dogbert17> nine: do you know where it is?

[17:11] <vrurg> timotimo: in other words: trying to keep the makefile as simple as possible.

[17:11] <dogbert17> nine: FWIW, here are the last half dozen GC's, https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b5c0ecd3e519d3bd1fe4496fb7306faf

[17:15] <nine> dogbert17: I'm pretty sure I got it! But, there's another one

[17:16] <dogbert17> nooo

[17:56] <MasterDuke> how do you do a git log for a file which no longer exists?

[18:01] <vrurg> MasterDuke: google says: git log --all --full-history -- <path-to-file>

[18:02] <MasterDuke> ah nice. a simple git log didn't show anything, but that did

[18:02] <MasterDuke> i was so confused. a rebase was showing both branches modified a file, but i thought it had only ever existed in one of them

[18:33] <AlexDaniel> I don't think this is realistic‚Ä¶

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> honestly I didn't have much time to look at stuff even

[18:35] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: releasable doesn't report url to the changelog anymore? 

[18:35] <vrurg> Or am I thinking of something different?

[18:35] <AlexDaniel> yeah it doesn't know about github releases yet

[18:36] <AlexDaniel> actually I'm not sure if it will ever know, since draft releases are probably not visible to the public?

[18:36] <AlexDaniel> but as I said, it's an experiment :)

[18:37] <AlexDaniel> I hope for devs it doesn't matter much if they edit a wiki page or a draft release

[18:37] <vrurg> Ok... I'm scared of the amount of updates I'll have to do in the changelog.

[18:38] <vrurg> ;)

[18:38] <vrurg> Wait a second, does it mean it won't report unlogged commits?

[18:45] <AlexDaniel`> vrurg: well, some bumps have important nqp commits so they're sometimes listed

[18:46] <AlexDaniel`> merges and other stuff I usually delete manually, there's a lot of stuff to delete anyway

[18:46] <AlexDaniel> there's also this ticket https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/53

[18:47] <vrurg> Considering that I almost never  commit directly but merging PRs ‚Äì things doesn't look that bad.

[18:47] <vrurg> Except that some PRs worth a couple of lines in the ChangeLog.

[18:48] <AlexDaniel> still it needs somebody to consistify and fix the changelog

[18:48] <AlexDaniel> one solution would be to announce that there will be no changelogs from now on, and I bet immediatelly some person will volunteer

[18:48] <AlexDaniel> but until then I'd have to suffer :)

[18:49] <vrurg> kaipei had plans for automating it somehow. How's that going on? 

[18:54] <MasterDuke> hm, how should i resolve this conflict? https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/d9ffae718e86ec3fe6f7e532f78aba5d

[18:58] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: if I was doing this I'd without a doubt keep the non-head version

[18:58] <AlexDaniel> so you also have to fix $cfg right?

[18:59] <AlexDaniel> no

[18:59] <MasterDuke> i mean i need the changes in the non-head version, but i need to adapt them to work with what's in head

[19:00] <AlexDaniel> I'm actually now very confused as to what you're doing :D

[19:02] <MasterDuke> rebasing the truffle branch up to master

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> oh then you'll probably see another conflict on the same line a bit later

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> because the print statement was then changed to ‚Äú$cfg->note(‚Äù, and I guess it's not going to play well automatically‚Ä¶

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: this is the commit: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3627de6d68b3563196ec500881dc135ce97d9cc4

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> yeah, you keep the non-head version and fix $options with $cfg->opt

[19:04] *** Ven_de_Thiel left
[19:05] <MasterDuke> i'm trying to figure out if both $options and $config go to $cfg->opt

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> so that's a convenient backcompat and its probably going to work :)

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> doesn't hurt to make a change and then try to see if it still works :)

[19:12] <vrurg> Actually, ooptions are purely for command line options. Please, don't mangle with them!

[19:17] <MasterDuke> vrurg: hm, then how should i deconflict?

[19:18] <MasterDuke> looks like it's building with what i did. i'll put up a gist in a minute

[19:20] <AlexDaniel> I guess vrurg wants to say that truffle branch shouldn't be doing what it's doing, I'd just keep rebasing and then later fix that on HEAD

[19:20] <MasterDuke> oh, hmm. graal is only java 8. a rebase might not be trickier than i though

[19:21] <vrurg> MasterDuke: it looks to me like you're using really *OLD* version of Configure.pl

[19:21] <MasterDuke> vrurg: yeah, that branch was way behind

[19:21] <vrurg> When did you branch it?

[19:22] <MasterDuke> gist updated with what i have so far

[19:23] <MasterDuke> pmurias created the branch, don't know exactly when. probably 2017/2018

[19:23] <vrurg> Oops... There is no easy way to resolve the conflict. What you should do is put Configure.pl aside, merge using master's version. Then re-do changes in tools/lib/NQP/Config/NQP.pm

[19:24] <vrurg> What is truffle, actually? I'm trying to determine where exactly it fits.

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> why is there no way to resolve the conflict?

[19:25] <AlexDaniel> I understand you'd have to resolve it for a lot of commits to configure.pl, but still

[19:25] <[Coke]> if you're not familiar with both sets of changes, figuring out what the intent is when there's a conflict can be hard.

[19:25] <AlexDaniel> but in the commit in question it's not hard

[19:25] <MasterDuke> truffle is a way/tool to build languages using graalvm

[19:26] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: ok.

[19:27] <MasterDuke> that has the possibility of resulting in a significantly faster jvm nqp/rakudo (in fact even the wip branch was faster for some long number crunching tasks)

[19:29] <vrurg> MasterDuke: ok, a lot of JVM-related option processing is in 3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib/NQP/Config.pm already. configure_jars method. I think you cold fit processing of truffle options in there as well.

[19:30] <vrurg> Or if it's gonna be a thing on its own (unlikely though) you could add configure_truffle method and stick it into Configure.pl alongside with other configure_ methods.

[19:31] <vrurg> Do I understand it correctly that rakudo would have to be compiled with it too?

[19:31] <MasterDuke> i'd need to create a branch in 3rdparty/nqp-configure for the first way, right? because truffle stuff doesn't make any sense for master

[19:32] <vrurg> MasterDuke: yep. But if it's gonna be purely NQP thing you could do it just in tools/lib/NQP/Config/NQP.pm

[19:32] <MasterDuke> vrurg: eventually. don't remember the truffle branch could build rakudo

[19:32] <MasterDuke> don't think it could yet

[19:33] <vrurg> Doesn't matter. If it's something shared among NQP/Rakudo ‚Äì it goes into nqp-configure. 

[19:35] <vrurg> So, then it'd be ok to branch nqp-configure and stick what you need into configure_jars. 

[19:37] <vrurg> MasterDuke: with regard to postponing the rebase, I think you should know my plans. Somewhere after the next Rakudo release (if it's not delayed) I plan to do to NQP what's been done to Rakudo: unify makefile for all backends as much as possible. That'd be a huge change.

[19:38] <vrurg> Though it is unlikely to result in any dramatical changes to Configure-related stuff, mostly the makefile templates are to be affected.

[19:39] <MasterDuke> hm. so you think the rebase would be even harder after that? or that there's no reason to go through the trouble now when there would likely be more trouble later?

[19:41] <vrurg> MasterDuke: I've no idea, really. If you have a lot of changes to the makefile, then perhaps it worth doing all at once. Because you would have to drop the current makefile and work on the new templates.

[19:41] <nine> vrurg: I rather like .t.rk or .t.whatever-extension-we-chose-for-programs

[19:44] <vrurg> nine: would you, pls, comment on this? Opinions will matter, I think, when jnthn is about to make the decision.

[19:50] <vrurg> nine: Nah, don't. Please, leave a note!

[19:52] <vrurg> MasterDuke: does truffle branch somehow depends on source file structure? I mean, is it ok with the overhaul I've done structuring cores and bootstraps?

[19:53] <MasterDuke> i think if the jvm build is fine the truffle branch should be ok

[19:54] *** pmurias joined
[19:55] <pmurias> vrurg: re truffle branch and that point it's hosted/parasiting on the existing jvm backend

[19:56] <pmurias> vrurg: so it's mostly a bunch of extra .java files and some Makefile rules to cross compile a setting to a custom bytecode format

[19:57] <pmurias> vrurg: so as long as it's possible to just add a few extra handwritten rules to the Makefile template we should be fine after the bootstrap

[19:57] <vrurg> Ok, sounds promising.

[19:58] <pmurias> s/bootstrap/refactor/

[19:58] <vrurg> pmurias: it is possible. Check the current rakudo structure. 

[19:58] * vrurg is afk for ~2hrs

[19:59] <pmurias> vrurg: it should be possible if it's done the same way
