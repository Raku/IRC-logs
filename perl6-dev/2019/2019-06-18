[06:35] <patrickb> o/

[06:37] <patrickb> Is there a tag for pull requests to signify the PR is not meant to be merged (for whatever reasons) and can be ignored?

[06:37] <patrickb> Typical case: "It's a nice idea, so I put it here, maybe one day I'll find time to work on this more."

[06:40] <patrickb> The reason I'd like to have such a tag is, because then processing all PRs is an achievable goal. A PR can then either be rejected, worked on to be merged, or tagged with such a tag. No more clogging of the PR queue.

[06:43] <patrickb> Name suggestions: "not-for-merge", "paused"

[08:16] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: Blin running!

[08:25] <rba> kawaii: what is Blin?

[08:26] <kawaii> rba: a tool for testing all of the modules in the ecosystem (https://github.com/perl6/Blin)

[08:26] <kawaii> to help identify any breaking changes we've made to rakudo

[08:26] <rba> ahh. got it.

[08:38] *** [TuxCM] joined
[08:42] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: sounds promising!

[08:42] <lizmat> patrickb: in some places people use a [WIP] (Work In Progress]

[08:42] <lizmat> prefix in the name of the PR

[09:01] <patrickb> lizmat: That could also be a good name. How does one establish a new tag? Merely by using it?

[09:04] <patrickb> Is the person creating a PR always able to add and remove tags?

[09:41] <kawaii> So uhhhh... This module is interesting

[09:41] <kawaii> https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Games-BubbleBreaker

[09:41] <kawaii> Every time I run Blin (via a TTY, not SSH) this appears

[09:41] <kawaii> when testing that module, and makes it impossible to continue

[09:41] <kawaii> cc: AlexDaniel` 

[09:43] <timotimo> oh, is it trying to open a window or something?

[09:49] <kawaii> yeah looks like it

[09:49] <kawaii> but it never exits and prevents the rest of the tests from running 

[09:51] <kawaii> I'm rerunning Blin now via SSH instead of a TTY to see what happens

[09:54] <timotimo> well, you should be able to kill it with a signal

[09:54] *** [TuxCM] left
[10:02] *** [TuxCM] joined
[10:09] <AlexDaniel`> There is a list of modules that are ignored

[10:09] <AlexDaniel`> On top of blin.p6 I believe

[10:10] <AlexDaniel`> So just add it there, and open a ticket for the module saying that the tests are insane

[10:13] *** [TuxCM] left
[10:13] <AlexDaniel`> Also blin should be able to kill it after some time by itself, but your terminal will probably not return to the previous state

[12:45] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: seen this before?

[12:47] <AlexDaniel`> what the hell

[12:47] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: did it come from Blin itself?

[12:47] <AlexDaniel`> or is it simply the output of some module that somehow got through?

[12:47] <kawaii> looks like it, it killed Blin 

[12:47] <AlexDaniel`> This is not a good sign, I have never seen that

[12:47] <kawaii> cc: jnthn ?

[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> daaaaamn

[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: so try to run it again, I guess?

[12:48] <kawaii> Yep just triggered another run

[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> hopefully we'll see the same issue in one of the modules

[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> but this is truly not a good sign, I have never seen Blin crash like this

[12:49] *** vrurg joined
[12:49] <AlexDaniel`> but! What is error code -11 ?

[12:49] <AlexDaniel`> could it be like a process count limit or something?

[12:50] <AlexDaniel`> timotimo: what's -11 ?

[12:51] *** [TuxCM] joined
[12:52] *** Tux__ left
[12:56] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: I'm assuming this is a more generic issue as opposed to an issue with a specific module since I went ahead and ran manual tests for all the modules in that snippet and they all passed with no regressions

[12:57] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: I'm trying to figure out what 11 is

[12:57] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: it can be something like out of memory

[12:57] <AlexDaniel`> this is the right resource, right? http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/errors.html

[12:59] *** [TuxCM] left
[13:00] *** [TuxCM] joined
[13:01] <vrurg> Is it possible during compile time to install a stub which would be later turned into role/class/constant by require? Trying to figure out how to deal with R#2983

[13:01] <synopsebot> R#2983 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2983 [regression] Cannot mix in non-composable type Any into object 

[13:01] <ugexe> 11 is EAGAIN

[13:01] <AlexDaniel`> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1123

[13:01] <ugexe> so lacked the resources to create another thread

[13:02] <kawaii> ah fair enough

[13:02] <kawaii> will give them VM some more to play with

[13:03] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: what's your cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

[13:03] <AlexDaniel`> ah no, that's the wrong thingâ€¦

[13:03] <AlexDaniel`> maybe /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max ?

[13:03] *** lucasb joined
[13:03] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: 31341

[13:04] <AlexDaniel`> on some systems it is surprisingly low, for some reason

[13:07] <AlexDaniel`> ugexe++ :)

[13:08] <AlexDaniel`> ugexe: but I wonder, why wasn't it UV_ENOMEM?

[13:09] <AlexDaniel`> or UV_EAI_MEMORY, I don't know the differenceâ€¦

[13:09] <kawaii> I hope my laptop doesn't set on fire from this, starting to get very hot from all this toasting :D

[13:10] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: I thought you had some beefy machine for it? :)

[13:10] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: how long does it take on your laptop?

[13:10] <kawaii> Turns out the work-supplied server is way slower than my laptop

[13:11] <AlexDaniel`> kawaii: also perhaps make sure that you have the latest rakudo for running blin itself, because IIRC json speedups are not in any release yet

[13:11] <AlexDaniel`> so all the zef stuff is probably much faster now, which should help Blin a lot

[13:11] <kawaii> I estimate that the work server would take about 8 hours for a full ecosystem test, seems to be about 3 on my laptop if it actually finishes without error :)

[13:12] <AlexDaniel`> interesting

[13:12] <AlexDaniel`> on a 24 core google compute instance it was just an hour, so your numbers make sense I think

[13:16] <kawaii> yeah my laptop is 8 cores so that makes sense

[14:45] <Guest77572> if I want to run e.g. './perl6  t/spec/S04-phasers/in-loop.t' that works find, it automatically finds the Test dependency

[14:46] <Guest77572> but if I use perl6-valgrind-m or perl6-gdb-m it no lionger works unless I add '-Ilib'

[22:18] <timotimo> huh

[22:18] <timotimo> that doesn't seem right

[22:18] <timotimo> you don't have any confprog or so in there, right?

[22:18] <MasterDuke> nope

[22:19] <timotimo> did you just grab my moarvm changes?

[22:19] <MasterDuke> yeah. but i'd be inclined to suspect my remove-profiler-overhead commits

[22:21] <MasterDuke> oh, i think i have some profiles from before your commits, but after mine, that show the same thing

[22:21] <timotimo> damn

[22:21] <timotimo> does the value for "inclusive" there look bogus in some way?

[22:21] <MasterDuke> no

[22:23] <MasterDuke> oh

[22:24] <MasterDuke> hm. it's greater than the total time reported in the overview tab

[22:25] <MasterDuke> but less than `time` reports

[22:25] <timotimo> `time` might include time from other threads

[22:26] <MasterDuke> oops, i meant also greater than `time` reports

[22:27] <MasterDuke> `time` said: real    0m2.174s user    0m2.336s sys     0m0.040s

[22:27] <MasterDuke> the profile's total said: 1950.57ms

[22:28] <MasterDuke> the top inclusive time was 3397.86ms (which had 1696.99ms exclusive)
