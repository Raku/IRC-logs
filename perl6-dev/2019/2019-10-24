[16:06] <AlexDaniel> Hey! Sorry for the interruption, but everything is on #raku-dev nowadays :) Please reconfigure your irc clients to join #raku-dev and not join #perl6-dev, thanks!

[16:08] *** tbrowder left
[16:09] <japhb> AlexDaniel: New topic time?  I'm thinking something like: LEGACY CHANNEL - PLEASE SEE #raku-dev INSTEAD | Legacy channel logs at http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev | For MoarVM see #moarvm

[16:10] <tyil[m]> I'm already in #raku-dev as well

[16:10] <tyil[m]> also you can set a channel redirect/forward to #raku-dev if you want to be super sure everyone ends up in there, right

[16:10] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o AlexDaniel

[16:10] *** AlexDaniel changes topic to: Are you looking for Raku language and compiler development? Please join #raku-dev !

[16:10] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o AlexDaniel

[16:11] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o AlexDaniel

[16:11] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o AlexDaniel

[16:13] <AlexDaniel`> we can, indeed, but last time I spoke to mst the idea was that redirecting is less than awesome for some reasons

[16:13] <AlexDaniel`> people have already moved to #perl6-dev, really, nobody is talking here

[16:13] <AlexDaniel`> oops, #raku-dev I mean :)

[16:47] <AlexDaniel> I won't be restarting all of the bots, but they will no longer join this channel

[19:48] <rba> AlexDaniel: What about an paranoid bot answering all messages with something like: "Please move on to #raku-dev, I need to be alone." We could call the bot maybe Marvin?
