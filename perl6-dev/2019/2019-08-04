[18:43] <Kaiepi> say you have a custom meta-class that you throw in EXPORTHOW::DECLARE::foo. should this also make it possible to refer to a type declared with foo from within a role that it does, a class that it subclasses, or another instance of a custom meta-class that it somehow uses by using $?FOO and ::?FOO, or does it already do this?

[18:51] <Kaiepi> alternatively, the code for declaring the symbols for $?PACKAGE, ::?PACKAGE, etc. in the package_def token could be abstracted out so it's easier to write slangs that implement that behaviour instead 

[18:57] <Kaiepi> just checked, it doesn't do this atm

[18:59] <Kaiepi> maybe abstracting it out for slangs would be the better idea in case people want to name however you refer to types using the custom meta-class something other than however you declare it, but in uppercase
