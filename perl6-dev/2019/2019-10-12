[15:26] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: you might also want to leave a review on https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/pull/89 :)

[15:27] *** vrurg_ joined
[15:27] <timotimo> huh, didn't i do that already?

[15:27] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: you did, but then there were some extra commits…

[17:55] <timotimo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/538774203378171935/632637238089613322/unknown.png - moarperf goodies, BOOTHash objects grouped by size

[17:55] <timotimo> (32 is most probably empty hashes)

[18:28] <vrurg> Why could a MVMString pointer contain 0xffffffff00000001?

[18:28] <vrurg> In moar

[18:30] <timotimo> that looks like it's not a VMString, but a P6bigintbody?

[18:30] <timotimo> it could also be that it's actually not IS_CONCRETE

[18:30] <vrurg> timotimo: that's what I find in code->body.name

[18:30] <timotimo> i run into that often, trying to access an object's stuff when it's actually the type object

[18:32] <vrurg> But immediately before that it calls a concrete sub. 

[18:32] <vrurg> It's still about R#2897

[18:32] <synopsebot> R#2897 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2897 [precompilation] VMNull in add_method in indirect use

[18:32] <vrurg> And it seems to be moar-related because JVM backend doesn't have the problem.

[18:33] <vrurg> Ok, will keep in mind that not concrete could cause this. Thanks!

[18:35] <timotimo> i can only recommend rr to find out why that would be in there

[18:35] <vrurg> rr? 

[18:35] <timotimo> i.e. watchpoint the address where that 0xff...00...1 is and reverse-continue

[18:35] <timotimo> it adds backwards execution to gdb

[18:35] <timotimo> rr-project.org

[18:35] <timotimo> BBL

[18:35] <vrurg> o/

[18:35] <vrurg> thanks again!

[20:01] <vrurg> .ask jnthn R#3199 is awaiting on your approval for merge. With regard to the new operators: may I suggest accepting them as an experimental feature? If they cause any trouble we can always remove them before 6.e is released.

[20:01] <synopsebot> R#3199 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3199 [WIP][roles] [WIP] Implement perl6/problem-solving#103

[20:01] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to jnthn

[20:01] <timotimo> who wants to find the right spot to clear the $*LINEPOSCACHE?

[20:02] <timotimo> wait, hold on, it'll just be deallocated if the dynamic goes out of scope

[20:02] <timotimo> never mind then!

[20:23] <vrurg> timotimo: I'm unlucky with rr. It doesn't support macos. It doesn't work in VM. 

[20:25] <timotimo> dangit

[20:26] <timotimo> first folks have amd ryzen, then folks have macos

[20:26] <timotimo> what's next

[20:26] <vrurg> Pi?

[20:26] <timotimo> oof.

[20:29] <vrurg> I feel like I saw something about replays and it was macos compatible. Hope it's not rust-related.

[20:30] <timotimo> maybe they have some compiler transformation that does something like that

[20:32] <vrurg> Nah, they use rr too. :)

[20:34] <timotimo> rrrust

[20:34] <vrurg> BTW, with regard to rust. They have funny feature of storing a value in enum elements. So, something like: enum IP { IPv4(Str), IPv6(Str) }; my IP $ip = IPv4("127.0.0.1"); – is possible.

[20:35] <vrurg> I liked the idea.

[20:35] <timotimo> yeah, sum types

[20:35] <timotimo> my ADT module has that :)

[20:43] <vrurg> interesting. I need to look at it.

[20:45] <vrurg> Lately, when I see grammar in a module – I exppect to be followed by a slang declaration... :)
