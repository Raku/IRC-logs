[03:49] <Kaiepi> that took way too fucking long to debug

[03:50] <Kaiepi> also welcome vrurg

[03:51] * vrurg thanks everybody

[03:52] <Kaiepi> at least i got to know a little more about how the grammar, actions, and world interact when i got really badly sidetracked

[03:53] <vrurg> Kaiepi: took me half a day to produce a singe line patch. Went as deep as printing debugs from inside moar... 

[03:53] <vrurg> And there is trully no better way to know the language. Painful yet effective way. ;)

[03:59] <Kaiepi> usually fixes are fairly short anyway

[04:04] <Kaiepi> MasterDuke is right though, i started a little over a year ago and now i'm waiting to hear back from the perl committee before doing a lot of work on networking features

[20:25] <jdv79> just randomly...  my regex heavy canary is unchanged on current.

[20:25] <jdv79> :(

[20:27] <jdv79> essentially the same since a december checkout so at least didn't get worse:)

[20:27] <timotimo> including the bump for today's moarvm merge?

[20:28] <jdv79> i just built a few mintues ago

[20:29] <jdv79> my test is on the fly regex heavy so its compiler bound...

[20:29] <timotimo> yeah, that would have the bump for sure

[20:29] <timotimo> and yeah, that will likely help more with perl6 code than nqp code, so perhaps not improving the compiler parts much

[20:29] <jdv79> i was hopeful but i get why there's no diff

[22:57] <japhb> It's not the bump, it must have happened before that.

[22:58] <japhb> Oooh, but ada116ef9 may be related.  Trying before that one.

[23:39] <japhb> Yup, looks like it was ada116ef9; ada116ef9 doesn't have the IO::Socket::Async::SSL failure (but does of course still have the MoarVM issue that makes Red upset).

[23:39] <japhb> Sorry, *5be7555fd doesn't have that failure
