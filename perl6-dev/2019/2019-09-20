[16:37] <patrickb> Are we actually going to have a release tomorrow? Asking because I still have three bugs that I'd like to fix / have fixed before the release.

[16:39] <patrickb> @vrurg: I'd really like to reevaluate the idea of having our own make implementation in Perl 5. I already started looking into implementing that already...

[16:40] <vrurg> patrickb: The release is highly unlikely, there are still a couple of blockers.

[16:40] <vrurg> patrickb: makes no sense, don't waste your time on this.

[16:41] <vrurg> We have nqp version. What we need is a handy way to use it.

[16:42] <patrickb> The nqp version can't be used for MoarVM.

[16:42] <patrickb> I don't see Perl 5 leaving us as configure system. So why not just use it?

[16:43] *** robertle joined
[16:46] *** anatofuz joined
[16:50] *** anatofuz left
[16:50] <vrurg> patrickb: I would rather consider possibilities getting rid of Perl6 dependecy. 

[16:51] <patrickb> Perl5 you mean?

[16:51] <vrurg> Meanwhile, as we can't do it, it's better to keep status quo. Yep, Perl5, sure. Missed the button. ;)

[16:52] <patrickb> I'm open for alternatives. But I actually don't really see what's so wrong with Perl 5. I think we didn't have any developer yet that was unwilling or unable to work on it because of the language.

[16:52] <patrickb> That's in contrast to about any alternative build toolchain there is.

[16:53] <patrickb> And then I don't see a simple and pragmatic way of doing it in pure NQP or Perl 6.

[16:54] <vrurg> My dream is to be as self-sufficient, as Perl5 is. 

[16:54] <vrurg> Anyway, it is definitely doesn't worth wasting time re-implementing, say, https://metacpan.org/pod/Make

[16:54] <patrickb> Do you have practical reasons for that or is that goal mostly idealisticly motivated?

[16:56] <vrurg> patrickb: A bit of this, a bit of that. Mostly because I was want as minimum dependencies as possible.

[16:56] <patrickb> vrurg: My idea was saving time wasted on having to fix stuff on the different make systems. There isn't even a way to test all of them without rebooting into different operating systems...

[16:57] <vrurg> patrickb: I test in VMs. Besides, nqp_578 branch removes possibly the last platform-dependant thing: first prerequisite variable. 

[16:57] <patrickb> All those makes could be considered as dependencies we have to stay compatible to. We shrink the dependencies by having our own make.

[16:58] <vrurg> Also true. But the point is not to make our life easier, but the life of a user compiling from sources. 

[16:59] <patrickb> I hope and think users won't have to compile from source much anymore in the near future.

[16:59] <vrurg> My rule of thumb: think what's better for those using your product.

[16:59] <patrickb> We'll start releasing compiled rakudos soon with every release.

[17:00] <vrurg> I consider package builders as users too. They're outside of our internal production cycle. 

[17:00] <patrickb> I plan to enable rakudobrew to install those binary releases.

[17:01] <patrickb> Do we really ease packagers a relevant amount of trouble by not having them install Perl 5 before compiling Perl 6?

[17:02] <patrickb> I'd say installing a package that is readily available for about any distribution in the foreseeable future is not a problem we should put energy in to optimize away.

[17:02] <vrurg> I think â€“ yes. They'd need to care less about extra dependencies.

[17:02] <lizmat> it becomes weirder when you have to install Perl 5 before you can install Raku

[17:03] <vrurg> Let's turn the tables. What's the point spending time on another make implementation if we already do statisfactory job of supporting existing implementations?

[17:03] <vrurg> lizmat++

[17:04] <vrurg> lizmat: Oh, a bit later, but I forgot to correct your last weekly. I didn't do a thing to MoarVM and only this week started with NQP. So, it was Rakudo only. ;)

[17:04] <vrurg> *a bit late

[17:04] <patrickb> lizmat: But Perl 5 is only a build dependency, not a runtime dependency.

[17:06] <vrurg> patrickb: anyway. The other thing is we must admit that Perl 5 is on the declining curve and we've no idea how would that affect Perl5 itself and its availability among distributions on the long run.

[19:53] <MasterDuke> vrurg: did you do `make -j<some number>`?

[19:54] <vrurg> MasterDuke: No. I just rework NQP makefiles and broke something.

[19:54] <MasterDuke> hm. then no idea, sorry

[19:55] * bartolin doesn't remember seeing that particular error with nqp-j

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> you still need a C compiler for moar, so why not perl5 too
