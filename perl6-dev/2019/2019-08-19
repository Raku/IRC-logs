[22:04] <kiwi_50> hi all, I have what I believe to be a significant DoS attack on Rakudo. I would like to report it in an appropriate private manner. Is there a documented process I can follow?

[22:06] *** pamplemousse left
[22:06] <timotimo> we don't have that kind of thing set up yet, this might be the first security-relevant problem we've had reported

[22:06] <kiwi_50> That's what I thought. The question is, now what?

[22:07] <timotimo> i'm trustworthy! but just telling me what it's all about is not really a "process" at all

[22:07] <timotimo> the problem-solving repo we just recently opened would be a good place to have a "how will security issues be handled" ticket with discussions

[22:08] <[Coke]> There is a mailing list, IIRC, but we never finalized the documentation.

[22:08] <[Coke]> Please open the meta-ticket to drive the process?

[22:08] <timotimo> oh, can i get on that? :)

[22:09] * lucasb is curious to know whats the problem

[22:10] <timotimo> the most difficult part is, you must keep quiet about the actual problem until a security patch and related mitigation info is available for the public

[22:10] <[Coke]> ah. the list was hosted as part of RT, I think.

[22:10] <[Coke]> So I would totally get whatever the new hotness is setup.

[22:10] <timotimo> welp, that's gone now

[22:11] <[Coke]> we got it setup near the original xmas release, and it got a test email, and that was it, unfortunately.

[22:13] <MasterDuke> maybe a one-time-use-only workaround would be to cross-reference the CREDITS file with some of the top contributors and send them an email directly?

[22:14] <timotimo> the problem-solving repo's readme has the "labels and responsible devs" section

[22:14] <timotimo> rakudo and moarvm both have jnthn listed there

[22:15] <timotimo> i'll open that ticket in problem-solving

[22:22] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/92

[22:23] <kiwi_50> Someone else that's P6 friendly posted about the problem. They've since removed their post. I will link to a gist that reveals what I think it's safe to reveal showing how the discussion and actions have unfolded so far.

[22:24] <timotimo> sounds good at first glance

[22:27] <kiwi_50> https://gist.github.com/raiph/16282cf2e837ffaf1d5f096722018a09

[22:27] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: AlexDaniel self-assigned there is no security process for receiving security critical bug reports https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/92

[22:29] <timotimo> is it fine to put their email address up publicly like that?

[22:30] <timotimo> oh, raiph, is that you? kiwi_50 

[22:30] <kiwi_50> gist deleted

[22:30] <jnthn> kiwi_50: In the meantime, you can contact me with the private details (I see Cro is mentioned, and I'm also a lead developer there)

[22:30] <jnthn> kiwi_50: [email@hidden.address]
[22:31] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: do you have a gpg key and can you read encrypted mails?

[22:31] <jnthn> And yes, we should document better what to do, as well as do something that allows for more than one person to be contacted.

[22:31] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: No; if you can and that is important to the submitter, then it's better that it goes to you.

[22:31] <jnthn> Oh, and: if gmail does encrypted mail out of the box then I can without knowing it :)

[22:32] <jnthn> I've just no awareness it does.

[22:32] <timotimo> you'd really want end-to-end encryption without a web interface doing it for you :)

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> no it doesn't

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> that's right

[22:32] <kiwi_50> Fresh gist w/ email redacted. I didn't think it was a problem, but I don't need to rely on what I think. :) 

[22:32] <kiwi_50> https://gist.github.com/raiph/7a1e1f81ce2c4a1fba3afad4ae8d3f64

[22:34] <kiwi_50> Note that I'm not applying NSA levels of care here and it's too late to do that anyway.

[22:35] <kiwi_50> The original post was online for up to an hour. Someone even posted a comment analyzing. Quite plausibly a hundred folk have read it.

[22:36] <kiwi_50>  And we're talking P6 here. I love P6 but it's not especially widely deployed yet. :)

[22:37] <jnthn> Better for us to go through the CVE dance while we're not, so we learn how to handle it.

[22:37] <kiwi_50> My preference is that we are suitably formal about how we develop this but I also would like to share the bug with jnthn asap.

[22:37] <kiwi_50> Right.

[22:37] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: like this? https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/92#issuecomment-522780268

[22:37] <timotimo> you can also show it to me! :3

[22:39] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: That's fine for now. Though really we'll want to set up a way for a few people to be notified, to increase the chance of a fast response

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> what about using https://hackerone.com/ or something like that?

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> I don't know how well it can work for perl6, but that's the thing that github is using (like if you find a security issue on github itself, you submit it there)

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> I don't know if bounties are required but surely we can throw at least some amount of money into that, no?

[22:42] <kiwi_50> timotimo: The irony is I was in the middle of typing a comment saying I wanted to share the bug with you first, but then you mentioned the email, and then jnthn turned up. :)

[22:42] <kiwi_50> and yes, i'm raiph

[22:43] <timotimo> hah

[22:44] <timotimo> i should probably get a new pgp key

[22:44] <timotimo> i was once dilligent at visiting key signing parties

[22:45] *** BeastieBot left
[22:45] *** BeastieBot joined
[22:46] <timotimo> anyway, the mail you'll reach me at would be [email@hidden.address]
[22:47] <kiwi_50> jnthn: I'm of the opinion that any attack, no matter how bad, at this early stage in P6's life isn't something NSA crack worthy. That is, I feel I can just send you a private IRC message or just a plain text email and, even say so in this publicly logged IRC message and it'll be fine. Am I nuts? Would you prefer I'm more cautious about it? The bug 

[22:47] <kiwi_50> is dramatic but I'm mostly doing this so we can take the *process* seriously.

[22:48] * leont has not-so-good experiences with hackerone and perl5, TBH

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> leont: more info?

[22:49] <leont> A lot of people don't even read the page well enough to realize it covers the language and not any of the perl.org websites.

[22:50] <jnthn> kiwi_50: I'd prefer to get it by email then privmsg, but anything is better than a bug I don't have any information about, so can't fix. :)

[22:51] <jnthn> That said, it's about bedtime for me, so maybe including timo or AlexDaniel would get things moving faster.

[22:51] <leont> People who actually do come with issues often want to call every bug a vulnerability.

[22:51] <leont> An overflow in the parser is a bug, but not really a vulnerability because if an attacker can add arbitrary input to that he doesn't need the overflow.

[22:52] <leont> Not saying it's all bad, but it does bring a lot of noise

[22:54] <AlexDaniel> that doesn't sound too bad to me

[22:54] <AlexDaniel> better than having no proper place to submit security reports

[22:54] <AlexDaniel> bug reports* :)

[22:55] <jnthn> How easy is it for anobody to submit there?

[22:57] <AlexDaniel> you have to register… :)

[22:57] <AlexDaniel> but otherwise it is convenient, I liked the process

[22:58] <jnthn> OK, sounds promising

[22:59] <jnthn> Though with the caveats leont++ mentions, but I guess if it's a well-known directory for finding how to disclose, it's perhaps better to be there on balance.

[23:01] <jnthn> sleep time for me; 'night o/

[23:01] <timotimo> gnite jnthn

[23:07] <samcv> what would you guys say the most perly languages you'd like to see talks at EU 2020 conference

[23:08] <samcv> i'm trying to expand it beyond just the perl 5 and perl 6 community

[23:08] <samcv> as long is reflects perly principles :)

[23:22] <samcv> but if there's a major or minor keynote speaker outside the perl community, or which doesn't usually talk in perlcon EU. please email [email@hidden.address] and tell me about it

[23:22] <timotimo> samcv: i take it that means the amsterdam perlcon eu has won over the cyprus one?

[23:24] <samcv> timotimo, that would be true

[23:24] <timotimo> the chances of me attending have increased

[23:25] <samcv> video of my presentation is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx44bh6lP1Q&t=7h13m31s after my talk is the competing cyrpus one

[23:25] <samcv> or just the slides https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx44bh6lP1Q&t=7h13m31s

[23:31] <vrurg> Is there reason why Grammar.parse doesn't re-use object it is called against and always creates a new instance?

[23:32] <timotimo> the match object / cursor for that grammar is an instance of the grammar, i think?

[23:35] <vrurg> timotimo: I don't know many details about it's internals. :) Ok, makes sense.

[23:36] <vrurg> Thanks!
