[00:37] <vrurg> .tell jnthn If'm getting right your complaint about NQP in detached head, then the solution would be to use --gen-nqp=master

[00:37] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[00:54] <Kaiepi> .tell lizmat, the RI::JSON optimization broke the JVM since it doesn't support NFD yet

[00:54] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: What kind of a name is "lizmat,"?!

[00:54] <Kaiepi> .tell lizmat the RI::JSON optimization broke the JVM since it doesn't support NFD yet

[00:54] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[01:15] <ugexe> vrurg: that is a side effect of their complaint, not the primary complaint

[01:17] <ugexe> so why not only rebuild moar/nqp when running Configure.pl instead of when running make?

[01:18] <vrurg> ugexe: sorry, what's them main one then? :) Anyway, I didn't see make rebuilding nqp yet.

[01:21] <vrurg> Oops, I see the point. Too late for today, but will get it straighten out tomorrow. 

[01:21] <vrurg> Configure.pl must not be worried about `nqp` with `--expand`. 

[01:22] <vrurg> .tell jnthn Got the problem reproduced, will have it fixed Monday.

[01:23] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[01:33] <Kaiepi> can someone merge https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2959/ and its related commits now that the moarvm one's been committed or do they still need to be reviewed?

[01:35] <ugexe> Kaiepi: spacing/tabs are off in the java one

[01:36] <MasterDuke> i restarted travis to see if it shows anything different now

[01:36] <ugexe> they were already off, but your changes just put them somewhere else that is wrong

[01:37] <ugexe> also if you make a test in nqp your PR will tell you if your java implementation is correct

[01:37] <MasterDuke> oh wait, shouldn't https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/553 be merged first?

[01:38] <ugexe> yes, if we know the java version works.

[01:38] <MasterDuke> why don't we have appveyor for nqp?

[01:42] <ugexe> we should

[01:42] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: https://travis-ci.org/perl6/nqp/jobs/542696075#L883

[01:43] <MasterDuke> so we need another nqp bump first, right?

[01:43] <Kaiepi> shit i forgot to update the bootstrap files again

[01:44] <ugexe> why do you need to rebootstrap?

[01:44] <MasterDuke> the --gen-moar=master job passed

[01:45] <ugexe> i didnt think that'd require rebootstraping...

[01:46] <ugexe> anyways, Kaiepi did you manage to find a way to test this on jvm ?

[01:49] <Kaiepi> oh

[01:51] <Kaiepi> actually wait --gen-moar=master passed

[01:51] <Kaiepi> so i did remember

[01:51] <Kaiepi> i tested it on the jvm, but not properly

[01:52] <Kaiepi> well, i guess there isn't a proper way to test if there are no tests written for this

[01:52] <Kaiepi> but i did check to see if nqp::freemem and nqp::totalmem worked

[01:53] *** evalable6 left
[01:54] <ugexe> yeah thats all i really meant

[01:54] <ugexe> are you sure you needed to rebootstrap nqp at all though?

[01:54] *** evalable6 joined
[01:54] <ugexe> i thought that was only if you changed an existing op

[01:55] <Kaiepi> i didn't, i thought the test you posted that failed was the --gen-moar one, not --gen-moar=master

[01:56] <Kaiepi> i did change nqp::cpucores to return an int64 instead of an int32

[01:57] <MasterDuke> i don't think it's really whether or not you change vs add an op, but whether that op is used in nqp itself when compiling

[01:59] <ugexe> Kaiepi: there are a bunch of .moarvm and .jar files in that PR

[02:00] <Kaiepi> yeah, because i ran m-bootstrap-files and j-bootstrap-files after updating nqp::cpucores

[02:00] <MasterDuke> i don't think that was required

[02:03] <ugexe> its also good to decouple your PR from the rebootstrap since they are unrelated

[02:04] <ugexe> we cannot revert one without the other for instance

[02:04] <Kaiepi>  QAST::OperationsJAST.map_classlib_core_op('totalmem', $TYPE_OPS, 'freemem', [], $RT_INT, :tc);

[02:04] <Kaiepi> shit i didn't notice that

[02:08] <Kaiepi> also nqp::cpucores is called as soon as $*SCHEDULER is created, which iirc complained about cpucores having the wrong return type before i ran m-bootstrap-files

[02:08] <ugexe> ah that sounds plausible 

[02:09] <Kaiepi> do i need to move the changes to the bootstrap files to a separate commit or are they fine where they are?

[02:11] <ugexe> it would be better if they were split, but i wont let that stop me from merging it anyway

[02:17] <ugexe> i'll at least wait for the s/totalmem/freemem/

[09:02] <jnthn> .tell vrrug My complaint is that I just configured with a --prefix so it would use the NQP I build as I please (which I'm pleased to do :-)), and then it decided to try and rebuild it automatically for me in `make`, leaving me with a detached HEAD in NQP. I'm not saying that's wrong for everyone, just that I'd like a way to have it leave my other source trees alone. :)

[13:00] <pmurias> Kaiepi: all the adhoc tweaks/cleanups seem fine (scs where not kept in a map because that code is from before I started depending on Map being present)

[13:02] <Kaiepi> alright

[13:02] <pmurias> Kaiepi: restoreThisGlobalContext seems to be only used in rakudo.js

[13:03] <pmurias> here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/vm/js/perl6-runtime/runtime.js#L16

[13:03] <pmurias> Kaiepi: so I think we could just get rid of the entire complex mechanism at store stuff on the context

[13:04] <pmurias> the runtime cost of a redirection to a singleton instead of a global is that high right?

[13:10] <Kaiepi> looks like you're right, none of the methods on GlobalContextWrapper besides initialize are actually used and initialize shouldn't even exist

[13:13] <pmurias> Kaiepi: the early design was to just save and restore globals on the context, then I decided to just move that over there and maybe migrate back to globals if the indirection is too costly

[13:16] <Kaiepi> wait

[13:16] <Kaiepi> the methods on GlobalContextWrapper are used in rakudo

[13:23] <pmurias> Kaiepi: yes

[13:58] <pmurias> Kaiepi: any thoughts on that?

[14:09] <Kaiepi> i agree, after poring through the code i don't see much of a point in saving/restoriing the global context

[14:55] <pmurias> Kaiepi: should I merge the PR in?

[14:57] <vrurg> ugexe: You're a great critic. May you have a look at https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/3 too and say what you think?

[15:00] <Kaiepi> sure pmurias, since removing the need for GlobalContextWrapper is pretty annoying to do and spreads over two repos

[15:01] <ugexe> vrurg: i'll try and remember to take a look at it after work

[15:06] <pmurias> Kaiepi: I'll make rakudo.js just keep everything on the global context tommorow

[18:51] <brrt> why do I have to redownload NQP?

[18:51] <brrt> (when invoking rakudo Configure.pl)

[18:53] <ugexe> maybe https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2970 fixes it

[18:54] <vrurg> brrt: aha, 2970 does. Only waiting for CI to complete before merging. 

[18:55] <brrt> Hm. Ok

[18:55] <brrt> I'll wait for a bit then

[18:59] <vrurg> appveyor is still broken. I thought it was fixed already.

[19:03] <nine> I think....this elaborate plan to fix the P6 subclass of a P5 class in Inline::Perl5 may actually work thanks to Perl 5 destructors being able to resurrect their object multiple times

[19:03] <yoleaux> 7 Jun 2019 19:40Z <japhb> nine: Is there any chance of a python3-compatible Inline::Python this year?  (Asking because of the global deprecation of python2 at EOY, and because my $dayjob is switching over presently.)

[19:03] <nine> .tell japhb Yes, Python 3 compatibility should be pretty straight forward. Especially since Perl 5's Inline::Python can serve as a template

[19:03] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to japhb.

[19:04] *** ggoebel left
[19:12] <ugexe> vrurg: weeks ago appeveyor went red. since then 3 other windows regressions have occured.

[19:13] <ugexe> so everytime we think we fixed that last one... we see a new test failure :/

[19:14] <vrurg> Ok, so I don't rely on it yet.

[19:15] <ugexe>   Cannot determine the brand of your nmake utility. at C:/projects/rakudo/nqp/3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib/NQP/Config.pm line 171.

[19:16] <vrurg> ugexe: Cannot catch this problem. Is it reproducible in your case?

[19:17] <brrt> vrurg: complains bitterly, but is otherwise moving ahead

[19:18] <vrurg> brrt: It should complain because your nqp is seemingly old.

[19:18] <brrt> i don'

[19:18] <brrt> t think that's true though

[19:19] <vrurg> What is it complaining about then?

[19:19] <brrt> that it's old

[19:19] <brrt> :-P

[19:20] <vrurg> Yep, but what versions does it report as expected/current? And check what binary path it checks against.

[19:23] <vrurg> Another thing about the fix: Configure.pl would only update nqp if --gen-nqp or --gen-moar is specified. I think this is how it must be.

[19:24] <brrt> yes, that's how it used to be

[19:25] <ugexe> vrurg: maybe you should add debug output to see why it does not match. this error is seemingly random, yes, but didnt happen last release

[19:25] <ugexe> even just create dummy PR with the debug changes so you can use appveyor itself to discover

[19:25] <vrurg> ugexe: already planned. Need to have some things done first right now.

[19:26] <brrt> vrurg: works now

[19:26] <vrurg> brrt: 👍🏻

[19:27] <vrurg> ugexe: unfortunately, I still don't have access to 'restart' button on appveyour. It complicates debugging.

[19:27] <ugexe> only guess is output of `run` has not fully populated whatever it string checks for valid data for, but IPC::Cmd->run doesn't work like that so i dont see how

[19:28] <ugexe> vrurg: you can just open a dummy PR that you dont expect to merge

[19:28] <ugexe> and force push empty commit to rerun

[19:28] <ugexe> or just push new commits since PR wont be merged

[19:28] <vrurg> ugexe: Sure, as a workaround. Just an annoyance. ;)

[19:28] <ugexe> I think you need someone with higher privs than me to set that up for you on appveyor

[19:33] <ugexe> at very least seems like you should be pattern matching on out_buffer or error_buffer, not on the mixed buffer

[23:27] <timotimo> ah, i did run configure, but it errored

[23:27] <timotimo> i don't have IPC/Cmd.pm

[23:27] <timotimo> when did we start requiring that?

[23:28] <timotimo> "install 11 packages"

[23:28] <vrurg> I would need to bisect it, but for a couple of weeks now.

[23:28] <timotimo> damn

[23:28] <timotimo> fedora users all over the world will groan at that

[23:29] <vrurg> How did fedora choose what modules come included with Perl5?

[23:29] <vrurg> Mostly a rethoric question though...

[23:30] <timotimo> ha

[23:30] <timotimo> yeah

[23:31] <vrurg> I checked out with https://perldoc.perl.org/index-modules-I.html as to avoid anything non-standard.

[23:31] <vrurg> Guessing that CentOS would do the same.

[23:31] <timotimo> most probably

[23:34] <vrurg> Anyway, I'd vote for leaving this one in. qx{} isn't sufficient in many respects. 

[23:36] <timotimo> i guess that's fair

[23:37] <timotimo> i wonder if we want to put in specific verbiage for users of distros that cut everything out of the perl installation? like "fedora users can run `sudo dnf install perl-IPC-Cmd` to install the missing package"

[23:40] <MasterDuke> lizmat: around? if so, do you have a repro for that bad profile you showed me?

[23:46] <vrurg> timotimo: when I was working on Foswiki there was a branch for autoinstalling necessary modules using cpanm. But a message is definitely easier to implement. ;)

[23:47] <timotimo> well, then a user would ahve to install cpanm first

[23:47] <timotimo> and probably also set up that local lib stuff

[23:47] <vrurg> No because cpanm can be used as module. I integrated it. Not that it was a simple task but eventually I got it working.
