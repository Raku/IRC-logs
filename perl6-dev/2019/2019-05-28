[07:07] <lizmat> [Tux]: indeed   :-)

[07:09] <[Tux]> http://tux.nl/Files/20190528090902.png :(

[07:09] <lizmat> git submodule update

[07:09] <lizmat> are the magic words I have been incantating a lot recently

[07:09] <[Tux]> lready done, to no avail

[07:10] <[Tux]> git submodule sync

[07:10] <[Tux]> git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

[07:13] <lizmat> [Tux]: is that a fresh checkout ?

[07:14] <[Tux]> I assume so

[07:14] <lizmat> hmmm....  vrurg ^^^

[07:14] <lizmat> will check in a moment: am in the middle of needing to reinstall a lot of modules

[07:15] <lizmat> which seem to be related to recent changes in perl6 configuration, rather than my move to a new MBP

[07:18] * [Tux] does some reset --hard's

[07:21] <[Tux]> same thing

[07:25] <[Tux]> https://tux.nl/Files/rebuild is what I use to rebuild

[07:27] <lizmat> I just did a fresh checkout in a separate directory, and to my surprise --gen-moar used a Moar that was already installed

[07:27] <lizmat> which is not what I expected, by my expectation may be old and incorrect  :-)

[07:27] <[Tux]> same here

[07:30] * lizmat has no idea

[07:30] <lizmat> perhaps moritz has an idea

[07:30] <[Tux]> busy with work, but a ping might bring me back

[07:42] <gfldex> now I'm getting: cp: cannot create regular file '/usr/local/src/rakudo/install/bin/../bin/perl6': Text file busy

[07:43] <lizmat> yeah, I had trouble with that as well, but I guess this is windows ?

[07:45] <gfldex> it helps to unlink first

[07:46] <lizmat> yeah, that's what I did in the end as well

[07:46] <lizmat> after which I had to re-install a lot of modules

[07:46] <gfldex> does Rakudo mmap?

[07:47] <lizmat> MoarVM / liibuv does, afaik

[07:47] <lizmat> hmmm.. seems all of my modules get installed under ~/share now

[07:48] <lizmat> well, I guess that makes sense generally

[12:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[12:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - still a WIP

[12:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - all objects, except the Profile object itself, now are shims around hashes

[12:20] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: AlexDaniel assigned to maettu Issue Push access to repositories in perl6 organization https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/33

[12:20] <lizmat> I guess still waiting on a resolution on https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/11

[12:22] <Guest12727> aha, so more input is needed

[12:24] <lizmat> perhaps... I must admit it dropped below my radar for a bit  :-)

[12:25] <Guest12727> could one way forward be to implement some of the flags which are currently NYI

[12:26] <lizmat> well, that's the question I guess: do we provide sprintf() with POSIX functionality at the level of Perl 5

[12:26] <lizmat> and do we implement something better / more extended / more extensible and not call that sprintf() ?

[12:27] <lizmat> or do we pimp sprintf() to become so much more than it is now ?

[12:28] <Guest12727> IMHO, having a sprintf which is roughly equivalent to what is offered by P5, C, Ruby etc would be a nice starting point

[12:28] <lizmat> well, apart from it being relatively slow and some bugs, we already have that

[12:29] <lizmat> or do you disagree with that assumption?

[12:30] <Guest12727> I disagree slightly :), looking at https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sprintf I get the impression that there's some stuff missing currently but I could ofc be wrong

[12:31] <lizmat> could you please add to the issue what you think is missing ?
