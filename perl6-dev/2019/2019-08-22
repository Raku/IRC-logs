[13:36] <vrurg> I like it! Not for a long time, but for a couple of months it'd be fun! :)

[13:39] <AlexDaniel> hmm looking at the code, it's a bit more difficult because it simply redispatches to another method

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> it's doable but probably not worth it

[13:43] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: then don't waste time. Maybe, if you have some spare time some day, teach it answeting to 'thank you, tellable6'. ;)

[13:47] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: why doesn't it pick up this ^? I guess, timo wasn't around long enough.

[13:50] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: because timotimo is currently on the channel

[13:50] <AlexDaniel> so I assume they see your messages anyway

[18:56] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: it's up to you. I would rename my repos too. But I'd be very much against removing 6. from the version because it's just doesn't worth it.

[18:56] <vrurg> We'd have enough other problems after rename besides of versioning scheme change.

[18:57] <[Coke]> I don't think we need to change our versioning scheme.

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: and in these years there were only two. Language versioning is what people were talking about

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: also, it's a bit hard to fix it without changing how we approach the problem

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> ok you can slap a minor version on top but is it really the best way to do it?

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> note that currently we don't have any solution at all. We just have always-changing errata branches

[19:45] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: what's that wrong with 6.c.1 for bug fixes?

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: it's ok, we just don't do it yet

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: and nobody thought how it's going to affect stuff

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: like, use v6.d is what exactly? v6.d.0 or the latest 6.d?

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> also there's no 6.d.0

[19:49] <vrurg> This would have to be considered yet. We would have to nail down 6.[cd].0 at the current -errata tip. Simply because no other anchors for that.

[19:50] <vrurg> use v6.x; is essentially `use v6.x.0`.

[19:51] <vrurg> We may have a few problems related to this. But they're inevitable whatever policy is chosen exactly because of current non-regulated state of the things.

[20:00] <vrurg> The problem with patch number is that we can't support all of them in the core. We would like to preserve our sanity untouched, don't we?

[20:01] <vrurg> So, compiler must just know what patch number it supports. If code requests higher number ‚Äì it's unsupported. If lower ‚Äì we accept. Anything else would be too costly to support.

[20:02] <vrurg> This also changes how `use v6.x;` is treated: the code just doesn't care about the patch level.

[20:16] *** pamplemousse left
[20:20] <[Coke]> the changes to errata were intended to be very minor. I'm sure we can come up with an approach that everyone is happy with for future releases.

[21:18] *** chloekek left
[21:50] <AlexDaniel> so minor that they don't deserve a minor version bump? :)

[22:58] <timotimo> heaps of praise upon whomever made a version mismatch spout a "WARNING" every now and then rather than abort Configure.pl

[22:58] <timotimo> it's so much more comfortable to develop with this

[23:07] <vrurg> timotimo: actually, it only warns if ignore-errors is set.

[23:07] <vrurg> Otherwise there is no other WARNING in Configure.

[23:08] <timotimo> cool, i have no idea how i turned that on, but it seems like i did

[23:08] <vrurg> Likely so. :)

[23:13] <timotimo> say hello to much improved error messages in nativecall when you pass wrong types around

[23:13] <vrurg> \o/

[23:48] <vrurg> Interesting, is there a way to find a lexical in currently being optimized compunit? I would like to have Metamodel::DefaultParent support multi-version COREs.

[23:49] <vrurg> $*W.find_symbol doesn't work at the optimization time.

[23:53] <timotimo> the optimizer has its own symbol finding stuff

[23:55] <vrurg> timotimo: just have found it. Unfortunately, there is no direct access to it from DefaultParent. I would have to introduce one more dynamic entity.

[23:57] <jnthn> vrurg: Hm, what would it be resolving differently?

[23:58] <vrurg> jnthn: I'm implementing https://github.com/perl6/6.d-prep/issues/9. Because it is different class behaviour, it must be 6.e version of Grammar. But it is used as a default parent.

[23:59] <vrurg> `use v6.e; grammar Foo { }` must use v6.e Grammar.
