[11:23] <pmurias> how should I bump NQP?

[11:28] <nine> gently ;)

[11:29] <pmurias> is there a tool to that (or is just putting the commit name from git describe) ok?

[11:48] <nine> pmurias: I usually put the git describe output into NQP_REVISION. I think there's also an IRC bot that can do it for you, but I've never bothered to find out which and how

[17:22] <MasterDuke> jnthn: i was thinking of only adding the ^compose message to the method-not-found exception if one of the suggested methods was equal to the tried method

[17:26] <vrurg> Looking for an advise. Working on a problem described in R#2694. The case itself is kinda handled in RoleToRoleApplying, but by simple testing for the same attribute object. It doesn't work this way because attribute in a ParametricRole is generic. It is instantiated when role is concretized. Hence, two concrete roles get two different attribute objects for the same attribute. What would be a good way to make sure two objects are the same attribute? I'm 

[17:26] <vrurg> considering objectid of the initial attribute + type of instantiated attribute.

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: if you can at least confirm that it's a regression that'd be wonderful

[20:42] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: if it's not, just file a ticket for them and we can move on

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> if it is, wellâ€¦ then we'll have to figure it out

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> like bisect it and whatnot
