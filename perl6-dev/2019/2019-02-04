[19:15] <vrurg> Hi! Trying to produce a fix for #2657. It looks like the only solution is to add another parameter to Mu.dispatch:<::> with a class type (qualmeth in spesh-plugin also gets this parameter). Unfortunately, it looks like the extra parameter slips into the paramers of the qualified call (my guess) because what I've ended up with now is 'too many positionals passed' error. I've commited my chanfes here: 

[19:15] <vrurg> https://github.com/vrurg/rakudo/commit/1052b9775277ef62a25b0c65a46a237ab4df5cb0 - and asking for a kick into the right direction to look for!

[19:23] <timotimo> R#2657

[19:23] <synopsebot> R#2657 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2657 "No concretization found" on role-qualified method call with inheritance

[19:23] <timotimo> jnthn: should it be possible to call self.SomeRole::method if SomeRole is done by a parent class?

[19:26] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, I believe so

[19:27] <timotimo> OK

[19:40] <vrurg> I would disagree. What if there is more than one parent each consuming the role? What path to chose?

[19:41] <vrurg> Taking into account R#2663 it might matter.

[21:48] <leont> It appears a few tests break it because they output non-TAP noise into the TAP stream -_-
