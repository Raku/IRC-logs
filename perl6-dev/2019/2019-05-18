[01:00] <vrurg> ugexe: I was away for all this time. Have like 2hrs to find out what's going on.

[01:03] <ugexe> the tests that fail do things like "if it passes less than 16 tests then TODO the whole thing"

[01:04] <ugexe> so its possible changes somewhere made it somehow pass enough tests to start failing

[01:05] <ugexe> it would have to be in moar master

[01:05] <ugexe> it could also just be incredibly flaky today

[01:08] <vrurg> I need to compare what fails on appveyor to what fails on my win7 VM. Anyway, I did no changes that would affect tests. And yet...

[01:14] <ugexe> the one that fails uses moar HEAD

[01:15] <ugexe> not whatever moar-rev rakudo is currently pinned to

[01:16] <vrurg> And I see that other PRs are failing same tests. Ok, at least I may no waste time on this and see what's wrong with OpenBSD build then...

[01:16] <ugexe> i think its the performance test that is failing though 

[01:16] <ugexe> not those two TODOd tests

[01:17] <ugexe> either way it wouldnt be from your commits

[01:21] <vrurg> Though it puts me in doubts of wether to merge the PR now. Hope, Kaiepi would execuse me for that. :)

[01:22] <ugexe> it looks related to some changes made in moarvm today actually

[01:22] <ugexe> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rakudo/rakudo/builds/24634161/job/cqsfwwncajwjta9j#L4681

[01:22] <ugexe> thats the failure

[01:22] <vrurg> BTW, I found the restart button – in a project I created for myself. Seemingly, appveyor doesn't think I have the right to restart a job.

[01:25] <Kaiepi> there's a problem with the feed parallelization pullreq

[01:25] <Kaiepi> after more benching it turns out to be the same speed or slower than the current implementation

[01:26] <ugexe> do a bunch of blocking IO

[01:33] <ugexe> i guess that isn't a good benchmark either

[01:38] <vrurg> Not every task can be succesfully paralellized. The cost of inter-thread communication might be too high sometimes.

[01:45] <Kaiepi> it's still slower even with blocking IO going on

[01:45] <MasterDuke> why doesn't nqp have appveyor and circle-ci set up?

[01:46] <MasterDuke> ugexe: does circle-ci offer BSDs?

[02:28] <vrurg> Kaiepi: are you still available?

[02:30] <Kaiepi> yeah

[02:31] <vrurg> It's about your change to Process.pm6. You completely ignore nqp::execname() on OpenBSD. But it returns a valid value if moar started with --execname.

[02:32] <vrurg> I'm gonna change it unless there is a reason not to do so.

[02:35] <Kaiepi> that's alright

[02:35] <vrurg> Kaiepi: Basically, it looked pretty reasonable before: nqp::execname() || $prefix ~ '/bin'. What was the point?

[02:36] <vrurg> I checked and it returns an empty string without --execname.

[02:37] <Kaiepi> it was returning random flags passed when i tested at one point

[02:37] <Kaiepi> that may no longer be the case with the new moar runner

[02:38] <vrurg> Ok, I'll give it a try.

[02:55] <MasterDuke> vrurg: is there a reason rakudo's NQP_REVISION is in tools/templates/, but nqp's MOAR_REVISION is in tools/build/ ?

[02:56] <MasterDuke> oh, did all your changes land already? or are some still waiting?

[02:57] <vrurg> MasterDuke: I overlooked MOAR_REVISION. 

[02:57] <MasterDuke> ha, simple enough

[02:58] <vrurg> Basically, eveything I needed I put in place. Just have no time for more changes.

[02:58] <vrurg> So, fixing bugs is the priority for now.

[02:59] <MasterDuke> sure, it's no big deal, just wondered if it was deliberate

[03:00] <vrurg> The plan was to have build contain scripts and templates – data files of any kind.

[11:12] <timotimo> can we find out how to get around the rebootstrap?

[11:17] <MasterDuke> i would like to, but not sure how

[11:18] <timotimo> without the rebootstrap it'll just not give you the options with their new behaviour?

[11:18] <MasterDuke> in the help output, yeah

[11:18] <timotimo> oh, the help output?

[11:18] <MasterDuke> yep

[11:18] <timotimo> hm, how is that built

[11:19] <MasterDuke> oh wait, i did a `get reset --hard HEAD~1` and now it does?

[11:19] <timotimo> ah, wonderful

[11:19] <timotimo> perhaps just have to "make clean" a few extra times

[11:20] <MasterDuke> timotimo: can you try my branch (at the commit before the rebootstrap) to be sure?

[11:20] <timotimo> only nqp changes, right?

[11:20] <MasterDuke> yeah

[11:24] <timotimo> ugh, i had some extra commits on my master branch

[11:27] <timotimo> huh

[11:27] <timotimo> was nqp --help always like this? just a list of options? with their blah=o? syntax?

[11:27] <MasterDuke> yep

[11:27] <timotimo> oh, OK

[11:28] <timotimo> maybe that does want a little bit of text

[14:18] <timotimo> aw, snap

[14:18] <timotimo> that's probably one of the "redirects" that rakudo has set up for old URLs

[14:19] <timotimo> hey ggoebel you don't happen to know both apache2 and nginx configuration? :)

[14:21] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/blob/master/apache.conf - this would want to be rewritten to nginx config format

[14:22] <timotimo> more precisely, here's the nginx config we have at the moment

[14:22] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/e9d36813a388d91c8abc17e58714cb69

[14:22] <ggoebel> ...and https://perl6.org/downloads/ is telling folks to download rakudo-star-2019.03.tar.gz

[14:23] <timotimo> that seems to work

[14:28] <timotimo> ggoebel: thanks for the report, perl6.org/downloads now points at rakudo.org/files/star/source instead of how-to-get-rakudo

[14:36] <MasterDuke> hmm, if you --profile-stage=foo and want to set the filename, what should you use? --profile=filename, --profile-compile=filename, --profile-filename=filename (though the plan was to deprecate this option), or something else entirely?

[14:40] <timotimo> i'd assume --profile-stage=optimize to go with --profile-compile=blerp.sql, and if you have --profile-stage without --profile-compile (i.e. with --profile=bloop.sql) it should perhaps warn?

[14:47] *** pamplemousse left
[14:47] <MasterDuke> do both --profile-compile=compile.sql and --profile=runtime.sql at the same time make sense?

[15:02] *** pamplemousse joined
[15:03] <timotimo> hmm

[15:03] <timotimo> i mean, we can make it work

[15:08] *** vrurg joined
[15:27] <MasterDuke> right now it says `Profiling is already started` and then `Writing profiler output to compile.sql`

[15:30] <timotimo> it might need a re-structuring of the call graph or something, dunno

[15:32] <MasterDuke> so we should warn now about the conflicting options, but it could be made to work later?
