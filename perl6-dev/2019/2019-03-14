[10:24] <lizmat> strange that it forces you to use runtime lookup of method name ?

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: first of all, yes, please send a signed CLA via email

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: but also… I just gave you access to the rakudo repo so that you can label things

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> accept the invite and label away, but send a CLA anyway, please

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> https://www.perlfoundation.org/contributor-license-agreement print it out, sign it, scan it in (resize your scan to 250KB or less). Email to trademark -at- perlfoundation.org (please scan and email if you can, it's so much more efficient)

[18:04] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: fyi I'm adding people here so that they can do great things, without waiting for their CLAs https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/settings/collaboration

[18:20] <lucasb> AlexDaniel: thanks! I intend to send the CLA once I'm able to :)

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: you need to accept the invite though, should be possible here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/invitations

[18:22] <lucasb> done now, thanks :)

[18:46] <lucasb> Tagged some as an experiment :) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/labels/type%20captures

[19:55] <lucasb> can I rename label "9999" to "edge cases" ?

[19:57] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: If it's just labeling issues, that's no problem

[19:57] <jnthn> "just" in the eyes of what the CLA is aiming to handle, I mean

[19:57] <jnthn> The work is appreciated :)

[19:58] <lucasb> I intend to mess only with the labels at this moment :)

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: yes

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> the name comes from a bunch of my tickets where I was sticking a lot of nines into things

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> like https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131966#ticket-history

[20:00] <AlexDaniel> wait what

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: so feel free to rename it, the name only makes sense to me, and only if I'm having these tickets in mind

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix++ also disliked the name

[20:07] <lucasb> I did, also update the description https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/labels
