[18:53] <lizmat> no idea why I needed to do that (again)

[18:53] <dogbert17> git happens :)

[18:53] <lizmat> $ git rebase master

[18:53] <lizmat> Current branch newer-sprintf is up to date.

[18:53] <lizmat> $ git checkout newer-sprintf

[18:53] <lizmat> Switched to branch 'newer-sprintf'

[18:53] <lizmat> Your branch and 'origin/newer-sprintf' have diverged,

[18:53] <lizmat> and have 29 and 1 different commits each, respectively.

[18:54] <lizmat> I have no idea why this happens and it feeds my dislike for git branches

[18:56] <dogbert17> it's an oldie

[18:57] <dogbert17> it believe it should be 1.000000+03

[18:58] <lizmat> indeed... Perl 5 does it correctly  :-)

[18:58] <dogbert17> do you still believe that the real problem is hidden in nqp?

[19:02] <lizmat> I have no doubt the sprintf implementation in nqp has several bugs

[19:08] <dogbert17> does your reimagined sprintf make use of the nqp one?

[19:08] <lizmat> nope

[19:08] <lizmat> pure Perl 6 (with maybe some nqp ops in the future for speed)

[19:10] <dogbert17> so there's hope that the rounding bug can be fixed then :)

[19:12] <lizmat> yes
