[07:45] <Kaiepi> not sure

[07:46] <Kaiepi> this time in particular it happened with a couple test files in rakudo's test suite, but it happens every now and then

[14:25] <lizmat> well, RT will be shut off pretty soon...  so if we want that USB drive, we're going to need to fill that now

[14:27] <MasterDuke> random question, any idea why `say (^8).permutations>>.sort(:as(*.Str)).elems` would have Mu.pm6's `proto method Bool()` at the top by exclusive time?

[14:28] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: saw it in a private mail, referring to https://github.com/rspier/rt-static

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: ok, so there will be a static version

[14:29] <lizmat> well... fsvo version

[14:50] <MasterDuke> there was a rakudo bump yesterday i think

[14:52] <MasterDuke> does that also need something in rakudo?
