[03:05] <Kaiepi> ok the fix is fairly simple actually, i just got caught up in how setting the encoding of the cstr is nyi

[03:28] <timotimo> i don't think that method encoding in CStr is going to work

[16:04] <patrickb> The "get the Perls into GSoC" project has started in earnest now. We are in need of project ideas and mentors. Getting up a place to collect stuff is in progress.

[16:04] <yoleaux> 22 Jan 2019 01:31Z <mst> patrickb: I never actively organised anything, maybe talk to mdk, sorry

[16:05] <patrickb> So now is a good time to think about whether to be a mentor and what might be a good project.

[16:07] <patrickb> nine, AlexDaniel, samcv, brrt, timotimo,jnthn: ^

[16:07] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: what's the time span exactly?

[16:08] <patrickb> Deadline for org application is the 6th february.

[16:08] <AlexDaniel> I mean if you agree to be a mentor, which months do you have to be available?

[16:08] <patrickb> Ah!

[16:09] <patrickb> https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline

[16:09] <AlexDaniel> ah, there it is

[16:09] <patrickb> I read that as May 6th - September 2nd

[16:09] *** ExtraCrispy left
[16:13] <pmurias> for mentors being available (at least once in a while) in the student application periods would help too so they students can coordinate their proposals with what needs to be done better

[16:31] * samcv clicks the link

[16:31] <yoleaux> 20 Jan 2019 18:48Z <MasterDuke> samcv: t/09-moar/Line_Break__LineBreak.t and t/09-moar/General_Category__extracted-DerivedGeneralCategory.t both have passing todos, think you could take a look?

[16:31] <samcv> .tell MasterDuke you can just un todo those tests. that is fine

[16:31] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[16:36] <samcv> ok i applied

[18:48] <pmurias> patrickb: is there somewhere you sign up to be a mentor?

[18:49] <patrickb> pmurias: I think you don't.

[18:50] <patrickb> ATM it's about collecting ideas (including a potential mentor) at https://github.com/perl-gsoc-2019/ideas

[18:51] <patrickb> So if you have an idea (That' be great!), go there and put it in that repo.

[18:52] <pmurias> I guess I could mentor somebody wanting to work on the js or truffle/graalvm (more fun) backends, I'll have to think about project details more

[18:52] <timotimo> any reason we're using the git repo rather than the github wiki?

[18:53] <patrickb> Don't think there's a specific reason, that's just what happened...
