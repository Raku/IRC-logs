[22:35] <vrurg> dogbert17: should be ok now. 

[22:37] <dogbert17> vrurg: I get that when running 'perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar' in the rakudo dir

[22:38] <vrurg> dogbert17: Did you try pulling from master again now? There was issues with Patrick's merge but they were fixed already.

[22:38] <dogbert17> git says that I'm up to date

[22:39] <vrurg> Works for me though... Hm... git submodule update? Must not be needed but still...

[22:39] <dogbert17> building with rakudobrew also fails: 'Found /home/dogbert/.rakudobrew/versions/moar-master/install/bin/moar version 2019.05-11-g248e298, which is too old. Wanted at least 2019.05-36-ge865f43df'

[22:40] <vrurg> dogbert17: This one I'm working on now. 

[22:40] <ugexe> unix/nqp-m- looks like an extra -

[22:41] <dogbert17> got the normal rakudo build working by doing a submodule update in the nqp dir

[22:41] <patrickb> ugexe: It's missing "reloc" or "nonreloc". That's most likely caused by an old nqp-configure

[22:41] <patrickb> dogbert17: Great!

[22:42] <patrickb> Travis also looks good so far. AppVeyor is in progress.

[22:43] <vrurg> dogbert17: could you please tell me what 'git config submodule.recurse' says?

[22:44] <dogbert17> should I run it from the rakudo dir?

[22:45] <vrurg> From where you updated submodule.

[22:45] <dogbert17> it says 'true' ?

[22:46] <vrurg> Then it's really confusing. Submodule had to be updated when you pulled the master.

[22:48] <dogbert17> The normal build is fixed, only rakudobrew remains

[22:50] <ugexe> the current appveyor failure is the 32bit/windows thing, so the build thing is good there now

[22:50] <patrickb> ugexe: Was just writing the same :-)

[22:50] <patrickb> So I guess we're good.

[22:51] <vrurg> dogbert17: Ok, I'll focus on fixing --gen-* things then.

[22:51] <ugexe> possibly just rakudobrew?
