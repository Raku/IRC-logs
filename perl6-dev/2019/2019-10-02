[00:02] <jnthn> One other thing of note: .+ and .* are not *actually* used to implement BUILD calling, and in fact what happens is not really possible to implement using them anyway, because we need the BUILD/TWEAK calls interleavd and other init actions of the class.

[00:13] * jnthn should sleep o/

[00:14] <timotimo> o/

[00:22] <vrurg> jnthn: Don't worry, I don't mix 'em up. BUILDPLAN does its own job. The grounds for the op (or ops?) will be done later. I only wonder if it's ok for BUILDs of roles and BUILD of the class to be executed prior to respective TWEAKs? Looks reasonable as TWEAK is better be executed on a mostly done instance. But I can see reasons for implementing it other way too.

[00:22] <vrurg> jnthn: anyway, g'night o/

[00:31] <tbrowder> .ask ugexe i am having build failures using Build.pm6 and can't figure out why. i try "zef build --debug ." and get a failure. i have Build.pm5 instrumented with try blocks and debug statements (using note) and so far have no clue. in the build hook i am using multilple copy statements which seem to be working and haven't thrown.

[00:31] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[00:53] <tbrowder> erg, that should be 'Build.pm6'
