[23:31] <epony> AlexDaniel, mentioned my nick name?

[23:31] *** redable joined
[23:31] <AlexDaniel> epony: hello :)

[23:31] <epony> howdy

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> epony: we're currently moving to #raku and #raku-dev, everything is already there

[23:32] *** redable left
[23:32] <epony> oh, OK

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> epony: I recommend to tweak your irc client settings to join #raku and #raku-dev and not join #perl6 and #perl6-dev :)

[23:32] <epony> let me see about that now
