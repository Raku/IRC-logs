[19:11] <gfldex> IO.handle.read with :bytes > 2**16 seams to return only 2**16 bytes without error and warning. Is that intentional?

[19:27] <MasterDuke> gfldex: what happens if you give a :bytes > 2147483647 ?

[19:27] <gfldex> same thing

[19:30] <MasterDuke> hm, my quick follow through the code paths seemed to suggest it would give an error in that case. so obviously i'm not looking at the right thing, probably need someone else to chime in
