[13:52] <vrurg> Argh, sorry, missed that.

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> and if you really want to test it out well, better merge earlier :)

[17:10] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: sure, I get home in around an hour so I'll start it then

[17:13] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: is it 07.1 or 07.01?

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: so it does a basic check to see if that build is ok

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> and that fails…

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: so if you can add this: `say run-snippet($start-point-full, $quick-test)<output>;`

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> we'll see what's wrong exactly

[17:21] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: will do so when i'm home, not going to attempt to use vim on my phone ;)

[17:22] <AlexDaniel> I'd love to have a usable phone, btw…

[17:22] <AlexDaniel> I was a happy user of N900 until it died

[17:22] <AlexDaniel> I used to write stackoverflow answers on it, it was great

[17:24] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: a bluetooth keyboard?

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> well, a small one? Maybe. But that's not going to solve another problem which is basically the OS being absolute shite

[17:26] <vrurg> something like https://www.amazon.com/HDE-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Playstation-Smartphones/dp/B00H88HC4Y/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=tiny+bluetooth+keyboard+for+iphone&qid=1564421135&s=gateway&sr=8-13 :)

[17:26] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: android?

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> yes

[17:26] <ugexe> keyboard + ssh

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> on n900 we had actual xkb being used for the keyboard stuff

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> so through altgr combos I had home/end and stuff like shift+home worked too

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> that's probably not as critical if you're a vim user, but I'm not
