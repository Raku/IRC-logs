[00:00] <timotimo> only in total, not on a "per snapshot" basis

[00:00] <jnthn> Oh, right. Hm.

[00:00] <timotimo> it'd be great to have differentiation between "deleted from nursery" vs "deleted in gen2"

[00:00] <timotimo> perhaps even per-thread for the nursery case

[00:00] <jnthn> tbh, I'd be more interested in knowing about trends between GC runs

[00:00] <jnthn> like, what types did I get more of

[00:01] <timotimo> i've been thinking about a "top types by count across snapshots" feature already

[00:01] <timotimo> is that kind of what you're thinking of?

[12:20] <tyil> I'm trying to build perl6 in Docker, but I'm getting this error: "sh: /usr/local/bin/nqp-m: not found", but when checking that path with `ls` I see that this file does exist

[12:20] <tyil> this is using the alpine image as a base

[12:21] <tyil> using debian:stable-slim as a base seems to build fine

[12:36] <patrickb> I still epicly fail to call a bat file with spaces in its path...

[12:36] <patrickb> Trying this for some hours now already...

[12:40] <timotimo> have you googled to find out in what way windows' argument parsing for bat files is simply batshit insane?

[12:41] <patrickb> I already gave up calling the bat file and thought I'd just call cmd directly.

[12:42] <patrickb> cmd /c "the full thing I want called including args"

[12:42] <patrickb> but that also falls apart

[12:42] <patrickb> it does work quite as documented when calling it from a cmd prompt

[12:43] <patrickb> but always falls apart when doing it with Proc::Async

[12:43] <timotimo> did you split the stuff that has "" around it?

[12:43] <patrickb> Tried about every variant there is.

[12:43] <timotimo> i think there's already a bug somewhere for the windows argument handling stuff in perl6

[12:44] <patrickb> That's why I thought calling cmd was so promising. Because that receives the full command as a single argument

[12:45] <timotimo> there should be an equivalent to strace on windows, right?

[12:46] <patrickb> hm, that might be a way to attack

[12:46] <patrickb> will try to reproduce with python to make sure it's a perl6 and not cmd problem.

[12:47] <timotimo> it could very well be

[12:47] <timotimo> try node.js, too, since they use libuv like we do

[12:52] <patrickb> python seems to fail similarly

[12:52] <patrickb> subprocess.call(['C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe', '/C', f'"{perl6}" --target=mbc "--output={bc}" "{path}"'])

[12:53] <patrickb> So it's not a perl6 thing after all

[13:03] <timotimo> whew

[13:33] <patrickb> I'll write together a Stackoverflow question...
