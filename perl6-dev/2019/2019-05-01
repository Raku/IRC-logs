[08:57] <kawaii> releasable6: status

[08:57] <yoleaux> 30 Apr 2019 19:25Z <b2gills> kawaii: Perl 6 Deep Dive is still just as accurate as it was when it was first released. I would recommend it for new and intermediate Perl6 programmers. (I could only get to chapter 8 before it got too boring for me to continue, because I already have a better grasp of the language than the book will give you.)

[08:57] <releasable6> kawaii, Next release in ≈4 days and ≈10 hours. 2 blockers. 132 out of 255 commits logged (⚠ 2 warnings)

[11:18] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: updated the release guide with a soft date of 2019-05-05 for 2019.05, so keep an eye out for my panicked messages then :)

[11:19] <kawaii> as my first release it would be nice to have others capable of guiding me through the whole process, if anyone has the time that day :)

[13:07] <AlexDaniel`> I have some deadlines until 20th so I'm afraid I won't be of much help…
