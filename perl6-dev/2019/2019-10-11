[19:47] <vrurg> patrickb: NP. That piece of code was commented out for the only reason to be overcaustios. Like "what if we need it again?"

[19:47] <vrurg> But we don't anymore.

[19:53] <vrurg> nine: That's similar case, but not sure if it's useful. I'm also trying to play with precompilation mode. For now I don't blame block_closure anymore and would rather assume that closure is not repossessed together with cloned code object.

[19:53] <nine> vrurg: have you looked into that lexical fixup stuff?

[19:54] <vrurg> nine: that's where I'm circling around now.

[19:55] <nine> Do you understand what it's there for? :)

[19:56] <vrurg> nine: Not in details. In big details, I'm afraid. :)
