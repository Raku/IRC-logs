[08:37] <|Tux|> test-t-20          28.163 - 29.698

[08:42] <jnthn> Hm, 1.669 is one of the lowest we've seen for a while, I think?

[08:45] <timotimo> in all of my scrollback at least

[08:45] <yoleaux> 07:26Z <patrickb> timotimo: For the record: --no-relocatable does not change the runner to be a shell script again. The things it changes are:

[08:45] <yoleaux> 07:27Z <patrickb> timotimo: - link libmoar with an absolute path.

[08:45] <yoleaux> 07:28Z <patrickb> timotimo: - Set NQP_HOME and PERL6_HOME to an absolute path and do not try to determine them at run time.

[08:52] <|Tux|> 2018-10-11 11:16:39 test-t 1.647

[08:53] <jnthn> Damn, that's getting close. :) Maybe my next round of EA improvements will get a new low :)

[08:59] <timotimo> the test-t times have startup time subtracted, right?

[09:09] <lizmat> yes, afaik

[09:09] <lizmat> or maybe  not... doubting now

[09:09] <lizmat> [Tux] ^^ ?

[09:10] <lizmat> reportable6: 2019-04-08T12:00:00Z 2019-04-15T00:00:00Z

[09:10] <reportable6> lizmat, OK, working on it! This may take up to 40 seconds

[09:11] <reportable6> lizmat, https://gist.github.com/603ff72e5ac3c20fdbd6b909224e7418

[09:32] <|Tux|> lizmat. the times I post here *include* the startup time. (see https://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/speed5.html)

[09:33] <timotimo> cool, so work on that will also be reflected

[09:47] <timotimo> not that i have anything for that at the moment

[09:52] <lizmat> can someone explain me the importance of https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/comma-ide-community/ ?

[09:57] *** ufobat joined
[09:58] <timotimo> people who have the AUR ("arch user repository") activated in their arch package manager, which i think many do?, will now be able to just use pacman to install (and keep up to date) their comma

[09:59] <lizmat> so that's pretty good and cool news, no?

[09:59] <timotimo> the barrier to entry to the AUR is relatively low, so it's not quite as trusted as, for example, debian repositories might be ... perhaps?

[09:59] <timotimo> would have to ask arch users for their opinion

[09:59] <timotimo> but yeah, that's cool

[10:05] <tobs> lizmat: yeah, it's community-maintained build scripts for software not in the main repositories. At least it goes through the package manager like that.

[10:06] <tobs> I just tried it, the script did its thing for 5 minutes and now I'm running comma \o/

[11:25] <Guest88667> lizmat: how is your sprintf rewrite progressing? (dogbert17)

[11:25] <lizmat> Guest88667: I've decided to first implement extensive sprintf testing

[11:26] <lizmat> I thought I understood sprintf, but found that I completely underestimated the intricacies of it

[11:26] <lizmat> so it will most likely *not* be in this release

[11:26] <lizmat> also: there's the question of making Perl 6 sprintf more logical instead of a maze of special cases

[11:27] <lizmat> specifically with regards to the handling of 0, precedence of flags and how the "%o" is rendered

[11:27] <lizmat> *format

[11:49] <Guest88667> lizmat did you see my theory as to why 0 is used instead of , e.g. 0b0 ?

[11:52] *** scovit joined
[11:53] <Guest88667> too bad Timtoady has gone missing, he probably knows the intricacies of (s)printf inside out

[11:54] <lizmat> Guest88667: I'm pretty sure that was done that way, because '0' in Perl 5 is false, and '0b0' is true

[11:54] <lizmat> we don't have that distinction in Perl 6 anymore

[11:54] <lizmat> m: dd "0".Bool

[11:54] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar 7931fc256: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[12:09] <Guest88667> that's what I thought as well

[12:11] <lizmat> Guest88667: also wrt to TimToady, feels to me he's more AWOL than MIA  :-)

[12:11] <Guest88667> lizmat: btw gcc on my machine didn't like the 'b' flag

[12:12] <Guest88667> seems to be non standard

[12:14] <lizmat> Guest88667: but it did like 'B' ?

[12:14] <Guest88667> test.c:4:15: warning: unknown conversion type character ‘B’ in format [-Wformat=]

[12:15] <Guest88667> perhaps b/B was never part of standard C (s)printf

[18:30] <patrickb> How are the commit shas in the Changelog meant to work? For my relocatability work, do I put only the merge commit sha in there or all the later fixup commit shas as well?

[18:34] <ugexe> put the merge commit under ignore

[18:34] <ugexe> group the rest of the commits as you see fit and summarize

[18:34] <ugexe> also in case you didn't notice: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2840

[18:35] <ugexe> i'm not sure if that can cause a regression when e.g. upgrading an existing rakudo or not

[18:35] <ugexe> im thinking no, but just in case

[18:39] <patrickb> ugexe: I've seen it. I'll look into that soon. Thanks for the pointer!

[18:41] <patrickb> ugexe: So I need list every single commit?

[18:47] <ugexe> yes. there is a list somewhere of unlogged commits to make it a bit easier to put that list together (but i forget where)

[18:48] <ugexe> but you don't have to put a description next to each commit. you can list multiple commits next to a single explaination
