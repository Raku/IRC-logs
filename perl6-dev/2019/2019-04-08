[08:38] <gfldex> is that intentional?

[09:09] <jnthn> Yes. Just because something *can* provide an iterator doesn't mean it should be Iterable

[09:10] <jnthn> When something is Iterable it will flatten under .flat

[09:11] <jnthn> I think we'd be quite unhappy if we had a list of channels and .flat hung because it started trying to receive everything from the channel :)
