[13:56] <dogbert17> m: printf "%e\n", 1000

[13:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: ¬´10.000000e+02‚ê§¬ª

[13:58] * dogbert17 wonders if the new sprintf implementation will handle this correctly

[14:02] <timotimo> we need a newsprintfbot

[14:06] <dogbert17> :)

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> oh yeah, one more thing that needs to be done is support for branches in whateverable

[14:33] <tobs> AlexDaniel: no pinging me please :)

[14:34] <tobs> I'm swamped with work

[14:34] <AlexDaniel> hahaha :)

[19:12] <tbrowder> .ask ugexe when zef installs a module, is the on-disk module compressed? i.e., does a module author need to worry about a large resource set?

[19:12] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe

[19:24] <nine> tbrowder: files get installed as they are

[19:25] <tbrowder> thnx.

[20:38] <SyrupThinker> The silly mistakes that happen because of tiredness, good night

[21:18] <tbrowder> nine: think it would be feasible (or worthwhile) to add auto packing/unpacking for resource files in the CURI?

[21:19] <tbrowder> pack on install, unpack on need

[21:21] <tbrowder> and that feature would not have to interefere with existing installed modules.

[21:37] *** Ven`` joined
[21:40] <tbrowder> should i make a feature request issue for an auto pack/unpack capability for CURIs?

[21:42] <MasterDuke> isn't there already a zip or tar one?

[21:45] <tbrowder> i saw something about that in the docs, but i'm not sure it is implemented in zef.

[21:46] <tbrowder> i see nothing about it in the zef readme, andvi have just now started to inspect code.

[22:34] <tbrowder> anyhow, i just added a feature request to rakudo issues

[22:35] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel can probably whip up a script to calculate space savings over the entire collection of ecosystem modules.

[23:18] <tbrowder> oops, cancel that thought. jnthn and ugexe showed me the problems with the idea. issue closed.
