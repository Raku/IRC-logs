[00:02] <timotimo> huh, really?

[00:03] <timotimo> i did not know that

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> so the issue is that it didn't just change, but there's a 6.c test too

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> 6c: my Int $x; say $x + 5

[00:08] <timotimo> Any vs Int, right?

[11:21] <timotimo> can my last nqp commit make it into the release?

[11:35] <lizmat> I think there is already an NQP and a MoarVM released

[11:35] *** patrickb joined
[11:35] <lizmat> but I think nine also had a fix in Moar that probably should be in the release

[11:35] <lizmat> so maybe a point release is warranted ?

[11:54] <tbrowder> hi, all. i'm working on a fix for GH #3036 and shortly will post a gist showing results of a WIP PR. the PR, ideally, will improve error msgs for embedded comments, leading declarator blocks, and trailing declarator blocks.

[11:56] <tbrowder> so far i have been fairly successful with the first two, but have not found a working solution for the trailing declarator. maybe moritz can suggest a solution.

[11:56] <timotimo> cool, is that the errors that normally tell you that the infix operator "=" is in a wrong spot or something?

[11:59] <tbrowder> well, my solution shows the invalid opening bracket. the message is basically a dup of the panic msg in the current code for the embedded comment. let me go post the gist.

[12:00] <tbrowder> here it is: https://gist.github.com/tbrowder/085ceedebabd38d1a73a46e360e3c2db

[12:00] <timotimo> ah, it's that kind of comment

[12:01] <timotimo> pretty amazing that the error seems to also have had a newline in there

[12:10] <tbrowder> well, i so far haven't had much luck with tidying stuff--there be dragons!

[12:12] <tbrowder> i mean as far as editing the remaing cruft after the error msg...not sure if it can be done

[12:14] <timotimo> the "expecting any of", you mean?

[12:15] <tbrowder> yes!

[12:16] <timotimo> if there isn't yet a way, should be possible to make one

[12:17] <tbrowder> i'll push the current state of the PR soon so folks can see what works so far.

[12:19] <tbrowder> i've tried many iterations of the grammar tokens for the trailing decl blk but no progress yet.

[16:59] <TreyHarris> Question that I'll pose on problem-solving if it's a discussion topic, but wanted to see if it is... unless doesn't take else or other chained followups because "if not" is exactly equivalent. But there isn't an exact equivalent for without except "if not defined(...)" [with the parens necessary for exact equivalence, yes?], is there? I'm finding myself really wishing for "without...[orwithout...]else" in

[16:59] <TreyHarris> top-level executables where you often have a lot of logic checking if conditions for execution exist, often including checking the presence of user flags, where without is much clearer than "if not defined..."

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: it also prevents double negation which is just hard to read

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> there are also some weird things we have like `orelse`

[17:11] <AlexDaniel> so I'd prefer not to add orwithout :)

[17:11] <AlexDaniel> greppable6: orelse

[17:11] <greppable6> AlexDaniel, 64 lines, 21 modules: https://gist.github.com/31071b3428a7b24fcf5d69542fa13532

[17:14] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: Ah, you were just a moment too late: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/63 -- but I'd say that "without EXPR1 orelse EXPR2 orelse EXPR3" isn't really a substitute any more than "if EXPR1 or EXPR2 or EXPR3" is for elsif.

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> that's right, yes

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> I'm just saying that “orelse” and the proposed “orwithout” are just too similar and a bit confusing

[17:23] <TreyHarris> Is it a naming thing? "butwithout" is getting long but seeems equivalent to me. "andwithout" and "orwithout" would be pretty much equivalent if it weren't for the fact that we can't read the words "or" and (or!) "and" in a program without assuming it has the Boolean-logic meaning rather than the English one. "nor" would work too.

[17:24] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: there's `but` too

[17:24] <TreyHarris> (Yes, "nor" has a boolean-specific meaning too, but I don't think it's as strongly attached.)

[17:24] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x = ‘foo’ but 42; say $x.Str; say $x.Int

[17:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4eb4c0c79: OUTPUT: «foo␤42␤»

[17:26] <TreyHarris> Right, but `but` doesn't have a meaning that overlaps here. I suppose you _could_ mixin to a control-flow block, but if you actually named your control-flow role that might be mixed in to "without" "without" so that "butwithout" could be a legitimate typo for "but without"... I think you're asking for trouble, no? :-)

[17:29] <AlexDaniel> ok that's what people use

[17:29] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: And in any case, it's not a strong argument against--I've found numerous times where people have tested for truth when they really should be testing for definedness but they can get away with it.

[17:29] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: it's not a slippery slope, we're already past the point where the user has to learn way too much

[17:30] <AlexDaniel> I personally don't even know what orelse is without looking at the docs

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> OH there is `notandthen` ???

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> “At first glance, notandthen might appear to be the same thing as the orelse operator. The difference is subtle”

[17:31] <ugexe> i generally use !$foo.defined 

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> you've got to be kidding me…

[17:31] <ugexe> dunno why

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> ugexe: oh! Yes, that's another way to write it, yeah

[17:33] <TreyHarris> So it becomes a question of least surprise--and I was surprised that without disallowed chaining. Because `unless` not allowing chaining has always been a normative argument (double negation is confusing and people will just chain onto whichever, if or unless, comes first rather than switching as they should do, so let's just force them to do so) which doesn't apply here--there's no such thing as "double

[17:33] <TreyHarris> undefinition". The opposite of True is False and False is True. But the opposite of defined is undefined while the opposite of defined is literally almost everything

[17:34] <TreyHarris> sorry, s/while the opposite of UNDEFINED is literally almost anything/

[17:35] <TreyHarris> I mean... you can't rewrite a without as a with, can you?

[17:35] <TreyHarris> You have to rewrite it as an "if not defined"

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> ugexe: ! is probably better in case somebody else comes later and adds &&

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> like

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> m: say (not Nil.defined && 42)

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 63a4d958e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> m: say (!Nil.defined && 42)

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 63a4d958e: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[17:38] <ugexe> yeah

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> yeah yeah people should learn recedence but I'd prefer my code to be idiot-proof

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> precedence*

[17:39] <TreyHarris> I think people forget (or, let's face it, weren't yet born or old enough to program at) the time when the low-precedence Booleans were first introduced and what a revolution in Perl's readability they made

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: no, there is double negation in double indefinition. Not not defined.

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: but I like your passion :)

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: can we steal it to simplify the language instead of making it more complex? :)

[17:41] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: that's double negation of double indefinition. The danger presented by chained unless is here: how do you write "without $foo" using "with"?

[17:42] <TreyHarris> s/double indefinition/undefiniton/ no double double there

[17:45] <TreyHarris> Complexity isn't measured by quantity of things, it's quantity of arbitrary things. And `without`'s very existence without (sorry, no other word there) a followup makes it an odd duck since it can't be refactored using a single additional keyword

[17:47] <TreyHarris> `with` was originally a specialized variant of 'given', a guarded topicalization. And `given` itself is just syntactic sugar. I'd agree with `without` being removed from the language as readily as not having follow-ups.

[17:47] <TreyHarris> It's current state is just totally arbitrary, which is the sort of thing that does increase language complexity in a cognitive sense

[17:48] <TreyHarris> Or removal of `orwith` and `else` after `with`. That would also parsimonize.

[17:48] <TreyHarris> But the current state is almost maximally arbitrary.

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> well yeah, IMO we should start pulling things out that are not very useful or justified

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> notandthen can easily go…

[17:52] * AlexDaniel reads the docs a bit more

[17:52] <AlexDaniel> “The notandthen operator is a close relative of without statement modifier, and some compilers compile without to notandthen, meaning these two lines have equivalent behavior”

[17:52] <AlexDaniel> come on…
