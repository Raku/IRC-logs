[01:42] <timotimo> did even the CStruct in nativecall arguments thing get fixed somehow?

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: if I understand correctly, that fix is the cause of R#2720

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> or… which CStruct thing?

[12:13] <masak> if I get a "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)" error, is it worth reporting as a bug somewhere?

[12:14] <timotimo> it can be

[12:14] <timotimo> i'd say it often is

[12:14] <masak> in this case it involves `use Test` and `done-testing`

[12:14] <masak> I wanted to refactor a working thing that I have into that, and it died with that error

[12:14] <masak> I can probably golf it quite a bit

[12:14] <masak> `use lib` might be involved too

[12:16] <timotimo> huh, that's interesting indeed

[12:16] <timotimo> with just that little it shouldn't be exploding like that i don't think

[12:17] <masak> right, exactly

[12:17] <masak> I'll try to golf it and report it later

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> I'll take a look later today, but if these are non-issues then we can finally have 2018.02 :)

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> I've been running Red tests in a loop and I see no issue

[16:28] <timotimo> we can finally have 2018.01 and then we better add some stuff so we can have a 2018.02 too :P

[16:29] <AlexDaniel> also it's February, so add one more thing and release 2018.03 right away xD

[19:57] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: what should be used instead of R# notation ?

[19:57] <yoleaux> 19:56Z <tbrowder> lizmat: josh merged my PR...back working on blog...

[19:57] <AlexDaniel> just #123

[19:58] <lizmat> but that won't link here...  :-(

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> #2721

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> well, then maybe we should fix the stupid bot :)

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> I remember Zoffix used to write R#123 #123 or something like that

[19:58] <synopsebot> R#123 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/123 For infix:<ne>, use nqp::isne_s instead of !eq

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> so that at least one works

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I don't know what's the right thing to do then

[20:01] * lizmat neither

[20:01] <timotimo> we can totally fix the bot do get that fwiw

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: well, which one :)

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: Geth announces commits, synopsebot links

[20:04] <timotimo> oh, you mean geth could put the right letter in front when reporting the commit message?

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> yeah beacuse it depends on which repository the commit is from

[20:06] <timotimo> yeah, but synopsebot also sees what repo it comes from

[20:06] <timotimo> because every line starts with that :)

[20:09] <AlexDaniel> yea that's also an option

[20:10] <nine> Seems like trying to find a smaller example to test the PDF::Font::Loader issue I came across another CStruct issue. This one's definitely not caused by JIT compilation. Looks more like a GC issue

[20:11] <nine> for ^20000 { is TakeAStruct($obj), 11, 'C-side values in struct'; } in t/04-nativecall/06-struct.t will start failing due to the array in the CStruct getting bogus values

[20:12] <nine> The struct in question contains a pointer to a CArray

[20:16] <nine> Every couple of iterations the values in the array change

[20:37] *** robertle left
[20:46] *** pyrimidine left
[20:52] <nine> Yes, according to valgrind the CArray's storage is freed by the GC

[21:10] <nine> Looks like the child_objs entry for the contained CArray is set to NULL by body->child_objs[slot] = NULL; in src/core/nativecall.c:1058

[21:19] <nine> Oooh...that's because cptr is not the pointer to the array, but the pointer to the struct member that holds the pointer to the array

[21:19] <nine> That's why the comparison between cptr and objptr fails. It's apples to oranges

[21:20] * lizmat likes both
