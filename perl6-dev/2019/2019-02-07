[00:31] <timotimo> jnthn: i had hoped i could just set VMNull into the "current arg guards array" slot of the TC, but it gets nulled out somehow and i'm not entirely sure how. so i'll just put a null check in the right place instead

[00:36] <MasterDuke> timotimo: isn't that the sort of thing rr is good for?

[00:37] <timotimo> yep, and it failed me on the first attempt :)

[00:37] <timotimo> actually

[00:37] <timotimo> i should recompile with --optimize=0

[00:38] <timotimo> that ought to give me a much better idea of what's going on

[00:54] <vrurg> Does try statement in nqp has same syntax and semantics as in perl6?

[00:57] <timotimo> i think it mostly does. there's no "Nil" though so not sure if it returns null when used for a return value

[00:57] <timotimo> perhaps it only exists as a block

[00:57] <timotimo> oh

[00:57] <timotimo> don't throw inside of a CATCH block, it'll retrigger the catch block itself

[00:57] <timotimo> or something like that

[00:59] <vrurg> There is a stranger situation in add_method where nqp::die short circuits on a try within that die parameters!

[01:00] <vrurg> When I added a number of debug prints with the same try block in one of them die started re-routing to that try. In both cases it's an infinite loop taking place.

[01:07] <timotimo> i'm not sure without looking at actual code

[01:07] <timotimo> have you tried the debugserver yet?

[01:08] *** AlexDani` joined
[01:09] <vrurg> No, I haven't. Probably should eventually.

[01:10] <timotimo> it can single-step, breakpoints, and you can navigate through objects' attributes and lists and hashes items

[01:12] *** AlexDaniel left
[01:12] <vrurg> Shame on me, but my problem is that I always hated command-line debuggers. It was alsways easier either to print-and-read or have some UI attached.

[01:13] *** Anderlok joined
[01:13] *** Anderlok left
[01:13] <timotimo> that's fair

[01:13] <timotimo> i do more printf-debugging than debugserver usage, too

[01:13] <timotimo> OTOH, commaide has suff for the debugserver

[01:13] <timotimo> i need to use that a lot more :)

[01:14] <vrurg> Oh, comma is on my try-and-buy list. ;) I'm ready to pay for it but would like to give it a try first.

[01:15] <timotimo> not too long until the community edition happens

[01:15] <vrurg> I used Komodo IDE for Perl5 almost exclusively for it's debugger.

[01:15] <vrurg> I know. This is what I'm awaiting for.

[01:16] <timotimo> i hope we can get some good feature requests out of that :)

[01:16] <timotimo> since you've used one for perl5 already

[01:18] <vrurg> Oh, that's very likely! But for now I need to find a way to reproduce the problem. 

[01:19] <vrurg> Removal of try from my debug prints makes the code die as expected. So, perhaps there is a surrounding CATCH somewhere or something like it.

[18:07] <jnthn> I'd no idea perl6-language was used any more...

[18:08] <timotimo> d'oh, i might have kind of been suggesting that mailing list for this purpose

[18:08] <vrurg> jnthn: what would be the better place to discuss design matters then?

[18:11] <jnthn> vrurg: I've been thinking about a better place, but for now such questions have often been filed in the Rakudo issues and given the CONSENSUS label

[21:17] <vrurg> nqp::istype when checking for a role in the cache only checks against role concretization and role group. Shall there be the original, non-specialized, role? I guess it must.

[21:26] <jnthn> vrurg: Hm, I thought there already was, plus the curry

[21:26] <jnthn> There's a @!role_typecheck_list that's meant to have All The Things
