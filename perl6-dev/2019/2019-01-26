[12:41] <scovit> How does it work here for submitting patches? You make a pull request and wait for manteiners to review the content?

[12:43] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2648

[12:45] <scovit> well, done it. It adds some functionality so I hope it stems a bit of debate
