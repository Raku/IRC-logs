[00:20] <MasterDuke> has anyone else built the JS backend?

[00:20] <ugexe> lizmat: yes. It works.

[00:38] <MasterDuke> ah, i figured out some of my problem

[00:40] <MasterDuke> it's looking for `nqp.moarvm` in my nqp directory. not in `src/vm/moar/stage0/` or my --install prefix

[00:41] <MasterDuke> if i copy it to the root of my nqp directory the build gets farther, but then just dies looking for `ModuleLoader.moarvm`

[15:18] <dogbert17> lizmat: what's your take on R#2788?

[15:18] <synopsebot_> R#2788 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2788 [BLOCKER][regression] Defined-or operator lets negative subscript cause a crash

[15:22] * lizmat thinks it's an interesting case  :-)

[15:26] <dogbert17> hopefully not a hopeless one :-)

[15:47] <AlexDaniel> I don't get it, I marked it but there's no comment?

[15:47] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: maybe a good opportunity to practice your bisectable skills :)

[15:51] * kawaii peers inside

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: my advice is to first use committable before you try to bisect something. Otherwise it's not very clear what behavior change you're searching for. Bisectable will always give you the right answer, but sometimes the question is wrong :)

[16:06] <kawaii> hmmm

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> yeah, that makes it easier for me to understand what was going on :)

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> and if we want to double check

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> c: 4ffb4082b0^,4ffb4082b0 my @a = 1..2 Z 'a'..'b'; say @a[$_][*-1] // 42 for <0 -1>;
