[11:36] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: that's 66.7% faster or 1.67 as fast… :)

[11:37] <lizmat> whatever... I had a 5MB unpretty JSON file that took 10 seconds to jsonify, it now only takes 6

[11:37] <lizmat> ± noise...

[11:37] <lizmat> so I figured I'd be conservative in the speed improvement claim

[11:38] <AlexDaniel> yeah that's pretty cool, just a reminder that we have tools/speedup.p6 that is meant to consistify these numbers :)

[19:24] <tobs> Does anyone have an idea about R#2571? I'm bundling an executable with my module but the executable is stripped when installed.

[19:24] <synopsebot> R#2571 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2571 %?RESOURCES execute bit lost on installation

[19:25] <tobs> Don't know if it's too hairy to support that in a cross-platform way. Maybe the easiest solution is to make a copy to $*TMPDIR on startup and chmod that?

[19:36] <ugexe> what needs to happen is META6.json extended to store attributes of all files in the distribution, so that upon installation CURI can try to accommodate 

[19:37] <ugexe> something like `"manifest" => [ {"path" : "lib/Foo.pm6", "perms" : "..." }, {"path" : "resources/whatever.exe" : "perms" : "..." }]`

[19:38] <ugexe> we'd eventually also use that to mark files that are generated at build time vs not actually included in the distribution, and so on

[19:39] <ugexe> sha1 name, file modified times, etc

[19:41] <lizmat> m: dd [{ a => 42}], dd [{ a => 42},]   # subtle differencve... and a bit of a WAT ?

[19:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Array element = [{:a(42)},]␤Array element = [:a(42)]␤Nil␤»

[19:41] <lizmat> m: dd [{}]  # also maybe a WAT ?

[19:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Array element = []␤»

[19:43] <tobs> ugexe: That sounds like a bigger project. Guess I'll be able to turn the executable into something I can NativeCall into by midnight instead.

[19:43] <tobs> To be honest, I've been mostly cargo-culting META6 so far. I wouldn't be able to file an appropriate issue right now.

[19:44] <tobs> well, the file itself is documented. What I lack is understanding of CURI

[19:46] <ugexe> you can to be able to tell CURI what to do with the file. its api doesn't take "file paths", it takes a Distribution which can be an e.g. socket. This means CURI has no way to infer what the original e.g. permissions of a file are

[19:47] <ugexe> so those things needs to be described in META6.json somewhere, and CURI made to understand that new description

[19:47] <ugexe> of course tooling would usually generate those entries into META6.json for path based distributions

[19:51] <tobs> it feels a bit like reinventing tar

[19:52] <ugexe> pretty much

[19:52] <tobs> but it sheds some light for me on the abstractions involved, thanks

[19:54] <ugexe> using tar files as our main distribution format (ala install literal .tar files) would solve the unicode name and case sensitivity issues on various systems

[19:54] <ugexe> although that wouldnt work so well for non pure-perl6 distributions (i.e. NativeCall)

[20:10] <timotimo> lizmat: that's "just" single-argument rule; just like [<foo bar baz>] is the syntax to get an array of strings, though with [{ }] it's not quite as useful

[20:11] <lizmat> yeah, I realized it was the 1arg rule..  :-)   but that's really not very clear from that context

[20:11] <lizmat> m: my @a = { a => 42 }; dd @a'

[20:11] <lizmat> ^^^ but I guess that's the same thing

[20:12] <timotimo> yeah, that's a more explicit way to write it i guess
