[15:30] <samcv> ah i found it on github. not sure why my local git wasn't fetching it

[16:07] *** go|dfish joined
[16:50] <vrurg> What may cause thred scheduler to lock up to the state where even Promise.in() isn't fired?

[16:50] <jnthn> Exhausting the pool?

[16:51] <jnthn> (e.g. all threads are busy, or blocked in a non-cooperative way)

[16:52] <vrurg> Ok, so it might be my problem after all.. Thanks, will be tracking it down.

[17:00] <ugexe> that should be easily testable with RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS

[17:01] <vrurg> ugexe: I created a new schedule instance with max_threads set. Not fixable, threads are being leaked somewhere.

[17:01] <vrurg> *scheduler

[17:05] <jnthn> RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG=1 in the environment may also help

[17:11] <vrurg> jnthn: Not much helpful. The pool gets exhausted - that's what I see. But I can't track down what consumes and doesn't release afterwards. Perhaps RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG_STATUS would be more helpful on this.

[17:12] <jnthn> Maybe, or just run it under the debugger and hit pause and see what's on the stack :)

[17:12] <vrurg> BTW, perhaps this kind of situation must be a warning. Or a callback on pool scheduler. Somehow the end user must know what happens.

[17:13] <vrurg> jnthn: I had problems with debugger. But the time has come to do something about it.

[17:14] <ugexe> you can get deadlock without threads too fyi -- https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3080

[17:14] <ugexe> loop { run("xxx") } for instance

[17:17] <jnthn> vrurg: Grab latest versions of things, including MoarVM HEAD, where I fixed some issues with heavily threaded programs using it (also some profiler and coverage crashes in threaded programs had the same root cause)

[17:18] <vrurg> jnthn: Good news and good idea. Will try.

[17:18] <jnthn> I guess if one exhausts the thread pool and the heuristic deadlock detection hits in and can't create another thread, we could consider a warning.

[17:19] <vrurg> jnthn: does it include a fix for R#2898?

[17:19] <synopsebot> R#2898 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2898 DESTROY is not called in a multithreaded environment.

[17:19] <jnthn> No

[17:19] <jnthn> That's an unrelated/different problem

[17:19] <vrurg> Yep, just somehow related. ;) Ok, doesn't matter.

[17:19] <jnthn> And in some senses a bit of a difficult one :)

[17:20] <jnthn> Well, if we consider every problem that involves threads related, then yes, it is. ;)

[17:21] <jnthn> I guess in general we can't know if the program is making poor use of threads but will complete, or if it's doomed, though I figure the deadlock heuristic probably captures the latter

[17:21] <jnthn> And if it triggers on a program that does work, there's probably a better way to have written that

[17:21] <jnthn> We can try it, anyway

[17:22] <vrurg> ugexe: thanks for the link, BTW

[17:29] <jnthn> dinner &

[17:30] <vrurg> App::MoarVM::Debug seemingly not compatible with the HEAD. Still expects a bash script.

[17:52] <timotimo> oh no, does it do that in the tests or something?

[17:53] <timotimo> oh, it doesn't have tests

[17:53] <vrurg> timotimo: it was about the README on github. ;)

[17:54] <vrurg> I can't install it anyway because:  ===> Fetching [FAIL]: App::MoarVM::Debug:ver<0.0.1> from [email@hidden.address]
[17:55] <timotimo> can you clone manually from that url? do i have to change it to be an https url or something?

[17:57] <vrurg> timotimo: https is more reliable, I think. I tried cloning, but then I get: Aborting due to fetch failure: Data::MessagePack:ver<0.1.2> (use --force-fetch to override)

[17:57] <timotimo> oh, huh?

[17:57] <timotimo> that's worse, that's not under my control

[17:58] <vrurg> I would install them one-by-one when done trying intelliJ with the latest comma plugin.

[17:59] <vrurg> Or won't need to if the plugin works. ;)

[18:01] <timotimo> :)

[18:03] <vrurg> Arrgh... comma CT almost works. But I can't create a new project! (facepalm) :(

[18:09] <timotimo> is there an error? can you "report it to the edument team"?

[18:12] <vrurg> timotimo: nothing at all. It was ignoring any close/new/open project .

[18:12] * vrurg wiped out all settings and starting from scratch.

[18:13] *** pamplemousse left
[18:13] <timotimo> o_O

[18:14] <vrurg> timotimo: do you know where to get  url of the standard plugin marketplace?

[18:15] <timotimo> you'd like to add plugins to the comma standalon community edition?

[18:19] <vrurg> timotimo: I'd like to get vim mode. ;)

[18:20] <timotimo> it's certainly the most requested plugin

[18:20] <timotimo> currently there is no support, but i forgot why

[18:23] <vrurg> timotimo: I had it installed with a previous version. And it worked in 2019.07 until I deleted all settings. Now I have blank link of plugins.

[18:24] <vrurg> It doesn't see marketplace, I guess.

[18:25] <timotimo> yeah, sorry, i dunno :(

[18:29] <timotimo> when you use comma as a plugin, it should definitely work with other plugins, but surely the plugin version of comma has some other limitations somewhere?

[18:35] <vrurg> Comma suffers from the same problem I'm trying to debug in my code: java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Thread limit exceeded replacing blocked worker :D

[18:58] <vrurg> .ask AlexDaniel can you run blin against https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3081?

[18:58] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[19:18] <vrurg> timotimo: moar-remote finally works for me. How can I find out file and line number for frames which are looking like: /Users/vrurg/src/Perl6/Perl6-As... 85 chars, 1 lines, key: observandum /Users/vrurg/src/Perl6/BO-Trading/li... 131 chars, 1 lines, key: tairn

[19:20] <timotimo> i'm not sure what you're pasting there

[19:21] <timotimo> but usually to get the right paths i'll start the moar process that is being debugged with the env var MDS_PROTOCOL set; in the future the debugserver will have some way to report what exactly is available

[19:26] <vrurg> timotimo: the paste is from a stacktrace. I cannot see where a frame originates from.

[20:50] <AlexDaniel> .

[20:50] <yoleaux> 18:58Z <vrurg> AlexDaniel: can you run blin against https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3081?

[20:50] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: not yet. Currently it only works for commits on master

[21:52] <samcv> 2019.07.1 does not pass against roast

[21:55] <samcv> AlexDaniel, i could release but want to confirm that's okay

[21:55] <lizmat> samcv: what fails ?

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> samcv: try agains rakudo-release-2019.07 branch in roast

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> t

[21:56] <samcv> results: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/samcv/77536b5b0a41b544fc5d6f0a5498be7d/raw/7570ae71a7d1735aa2ddf590cbaec9beea286149/gistfile1.txt

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> yeah that's on master

[21:56] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: why wasn't that merged yet ?

[21:56] <samcv> any way to get a list of all branches on a remote?

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's 0 commits ahead, there's nothing to merge

[21:57] <timotimo> "git branch -a" should show everything

[21:57] <timotimo> oh, on *a* remote

[21:57] <samcv> timotimo, thanks!

[21:57] <timotimo> "git remote show origin" will do that

[21:58] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: then why should samcv test against a branch ?

[21:58] <samcv> i've known how to fetch if if if i know the name. but otherwise no

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: because every past release only passes roast at the time of the release. After the release people add more tests that can't pass on older rakudo versions

[21:59] <samcv> well i was on roast master and it didn't pass. unless i'm wrong

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> well, “at the time of the release” is conveniently marked as rakudo-release-2019.07 branch :)

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> basically, master is a moving target, you can't make a release that will work for tests that don't exist yet

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> the only issue here is that we never marked which roast commit worked with which release

[22:05] <samcv> AlexDaniel, good point. not sure if we need a roast branch too. even if just a matter of formality

[22:06] <samcv> it could make testing previous releases easier

[22:11] <AlexDaniel> this is the list that I have: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/b0b85da7383edc7e6eb10f05c3509939

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> you can get roast commits for other releases by looking at the date, I think

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> ± a few commits

[22:13] <AlexDaniel> I have these because they were released from branches, so I had to know which commit I'm testing against

[23:01] <timotimo> cool

[23:02] <vrurg> it's more like a quick hack, but it all looks like a one big hack to me. ;)

[23:02] <timotimo> it was quickly done, yeah :(

[23:02] <timotimo> no overarching plan to how the commands should look

[23:02] <timotimo> the help page is like multiple screens full, which is also bad

[23:03] <vrurg> ah, whatever. There're bigger problems than a hacky debugger.

[23:04] <timotimo> honestly, now that i'm doing a bit more with the gtk bindings ...

[23:04] <timotimo> no promises!

[23:04] <timotimo> did you see the gtk/cairo livecoding toy?

[23:04] <vrurg> Hm... I heard nothing interesting here...

[23:05] <vrurg> No, I don't play with GUIs usually.

[23:05] <timotimo> it's probably a bit easier to get tab completion or something like it to work in a gui than it is in the terminal

[23:05] <vrurg> Something like this I saw recently at an Apple Store. ;)

[23:05] <timotimo> because seriously F having to deal with all the terminal oddities

[23:06] <vrurg> Besides, that's where I love GUIs: when all your debug info is sitting right beside the source and the output. No need to jump back and forth between windows.

[23:07] <timotimo> yeah

[23:07] <timotimo> .o( no need to jump back and froth over windows )

[23:10] <timotimo> thank you for your contributions

[23:10] <timotimo> i hope the changed url makes it easier to install
