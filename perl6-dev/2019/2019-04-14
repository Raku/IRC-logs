[08:59] <yoleaux> 13 Apr 2019 21:13Z <lizmat> nine: would you rather see a rephrasing of the message, or a revert of the commit ?

[08:59] <yoleaux> 13 Apr 2019 21:33Z <jnthn> nine: If you're going to use a type as the target type in an nqp::rebless, then :is_mixin now needs to be passed to ClassHOW.new_type.

[08:59] <yoleaux> 13 Apr 2019 21:37Z <jnthn> nine: No guesses on the second; unfortunately the line number just points at the generate_buildplan_executor method. Don't suppose --ll-exception gives a better trace? Or I can try it out when I get some time to do that :)

[09:00] <lizmat> nine o/

[09:00] <nine> \o

[09:04] <lizmat> re message: the message is only shown for scripts that use MAIN

[09:04] <lizmat> *not* in general when reading from a keyboard

[09:08] <nine> I still vote for reverting the commit. MAIN's purpose is for writing command line tools and waiting for input from STDIN when no other source was given is common and expected behaviour.

[09:10] <nine> E.g. I've often started something like "grep foobar > filtered-list" and then pasted output from another command from another terminal into that, even when doing development of rakudo.

[09:11] <nine> Or fired up psql, worked on a query and when I got it right wrapped it in a copy( ... ) to stdout with csv; and pasted the resulting CSV data into another script waiting to process it further

[09:13] <nine> .tell jnthn I only got that line number with --ll-exception in the first place.

[09:13] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[09:19] <lizmat> nine: fwiw, this has bitten me a few times as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/bc0efq/sql2png_turn_create_table_statements_into_a_graph/ekq6khy/

[09:20] <lizmat> it would only save me maybe a few seconds now before I figured it out

[09:20] <lizmat> but this feels like a trap to me, hence my solution

[09:21] <lizmat> nine: maybe only do this if STDOUT and STDERR also have .t true ?

[10:44] <nine> lizmat: still doesn't feel right but it may be the best compromise we will find :)

[10:45] <nine> Is there any way for a class or rather that class' meta class to find out when a subclass is created?

[10:49] <lizmat> parents don't know of their children afaik, so no ?

[10:52] <nine> .oO(What has the world come to, when parents don't even know their own children anymore?)

[10:53] <nine> On the bright side, I may not actually need that anyway.

[10:54] <lizmat> yeah, Perl 6 is a harsh world and sets a bad example  :-)

[10:55] <lizmat> still, children knowing about their parents is a good thing

[10:55] <lizmat> plenty of children in the world who don't know that

[10:55] <nine> Right now, Perl 5 classes get a representation in Perl 6 via Inline::Perl5::ClassHOW. To get rid of the rebless hack I mentioned as broken yesterday, I'm gonna need Perl 6 classes to be represented in the Perl 5 world. But that's true for all classes that are used, not just instances of Inline::Perl5::ClassHOW.

[10:57] <nine> I guess I'm gonna need to create that representation whenever I encounter an object of a previously unseen Perl 6 class getting passed to Perl 5 code.

[11:00] <lizmat> feels a bit like synthetic codepoints to me  :-)

[11:09] <nine> This will be a very useful but also a very large refactor. I'm not sure if I feel up to it :/

[13:53] <Kaiepi> for the $*SCHEDULER.cue pullreq, how would i properly unit test that the block past never gets invoked when the timeout is Inf?

[13:54] <Kaiepi> i was thinking of using a Supplier and emitting to it in each block passed for that series of tests then counting how many blocks were invoked at the end to decide whether to pass or flunk

[13:54] <Kaiepi> s/past/passed/

[13:58] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: i ran through most of those examples from your history with master and my default-int branch. the only significant differences were further cases of illegal array accesses turning into `cannot unbox` errors

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> hm

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> sounds good then, I guess

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> I mean, if anybody feels like, maybe the same should be done on a 32-bit system

[16:39] *** AlexDaniel left
[17:14] <MasterDuke> interesting. if i change https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Mu.pm6#L548 to remove the '?' from the method call and then try `my $b; say "a $b c"`, $name becomes 'element', so the warning is `Use of uninitialized value element of type Any in string context.`

[17:15] <MasterDuke> 'element' seems to come from here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Metamodel/BOOTSTRAP.nqp#L1697

[20:45] <Kaiepi> damn it i'm close to fixing the issue with executable names on openbsd but it gets perl6.moarvm, not the binary itself

[20:45] <Kaiepi> turns out MVM_exepath was actually there for a reason

[20:47] <Kaiepi> i tried deleting it, lazily getting the executable name in MVM_executable_name, and just using uv_exepath in rakudo but that doesn't work

[20:48] <Kaiepi> i think all i need to do is just add it back and use it in rakudo again
