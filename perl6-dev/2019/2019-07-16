[02:00] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: ping?

[02:02] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: pong pong pong

[02:03] <vrurg> I'm finishing fixing CORE loading + PseudoStash. The latter behaves slightly differently for 6.e now. shall I preserve pseudo.t for 6.c and have a new pseudo-6e.t?

[02:04] <vrurg> Or I just add 'use v6.e.PREVIEW' into the test?

[02:04] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: what's PseudoStash?

[02:04] <vrurg> .WHO behind pseudo-packages.

[02:04] <AlexDaniel> ahhh

[02:05] <vrurg> No really relevant. The point is that where previously PSEUDO::<NotExisting> was returning Nil â€“ it now returns Failure as ::() does.

[02:06] <vrurg> Plus some clarification to what symbols are visible by what PSEUDO::, like LEXICAL:: now represents all syms visible in a scope, both lexical and dynamic.

[02:07] <vrurg> But the point is that I now have REALLY separate CORE.setting for each use v6.X, so with v6.c PseudoStash is what it is used to be before 6.e, but the new one is loaded for 6.e.

[02:08] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yeah, I think a new file makes sense

[02:08] <AlexDaniel> in fact it's probably the only way to do it

[02:09] <AlexDaniel> since we still want to test the behavior when `use v6.c` is used, right?

[02:09] <vrurg> Besides, additional tests for different revisions would now make real sense.

[02:09] <vrurg> You've got my point. :)

[02:09] <vrurg> Ok, thanks!

[02:09] <AlexDaniel> well, that wasn't that hard :)

[15:20] <ugexe> we still need a way to set the full CUR resolution from scratch, not just add CURs

[15:21] <ugexe> so that when spawning a process we can do `run $*EXECUTABLE, @current-libs, 'foo.p6'` and have it do the right thing

[15:21] <ugexe> the best you can do is similar to the above, but then you have redundant entries at the end

[15:22] <ugexe> which can change repo-ids

[15:23] <ugexe> so like PERL6LIB but will overwrite any default repos

[16:55] <AlexDaniel> alrightâ€¦

[16:55] <lizmat> sorry, I'm afraid I'm out of sync

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: summed it up here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2650#issuecomment-511899892

[16:57] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: I think jnthn is travelling today

[16:58] <AlexDaniel> I mean, wellâ€¦ the release is definitely not happening if there are failing tests, this is perl6 not php :D

[17:00] <lizmat> in absence of jnthn, I would say cherry-pick the tests

[17:00] *** pamplemousse_ joined
[17:03] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what about comments like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/23fca8f6fb45d2a2d694c63862c27a26ec0df252#commitcomment-32778083 ?

[17:03] <AlexDaniel> were these addressed in some way?

[17:04] <AlexDaniel> hm, I'm actually surprised that these are the only tests that need some tweaking

[17:05] <AlexDaniel> and IIRC no modules were found where this would be an issue, so we're okay?

[17:05] <AlexDaniel> I guess I'm fine with cherry-picking itâ€¦ probably

[17:05] <lizmat> I think so, I mean Blin was clean?

[17:05] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[17:06] <lizmat> then please cherry-pick

[18:58] <TreyHarris> I self-assigned the ticket to switch perl6/doc on GitHub to the new(er) issue/PR templating system bc I've done it before on another project, but turns out I was either removed from the role giving me repo management access in the Perl 6 org or the roles changed. I asked jmerelo if he could promote me since it's the doc repo, but I don't know if he has rights to change others' roles?

[19:26] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: thanks--if you could give me admin rights to perl6/perl6-mode, too, I'd appreciate it--I had them when I started the project to make the org fork the official version, so dunno when I lost them

[19:27] <TreyHarris> I messed up some project milestones before realizing without admin rights I can't adjust columns

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: what about now?

[19:35] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: sorry, I realized this is confusing for IRC, so I just created an issue in the perl6/perl6-mode repo

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: but can you check it now? Still no access to the Settings tab?

[19:36] <tbrowder> PR #3056 comments now show the problem and results after the fixes

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> yeah pretty sure that's the caseâ€¦

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> OK, thenâ€¦

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: should be good now

[19:37] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: lol, I thought you were saying "what about now?" like the exclamation, sorry :-D

[19:39] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: I can't see Settings in either repo, but perhaps there's a propagation delay?

[19:41] <TreyHarris> It isn't browser caching, I just logged in using a new browser on another machine, still no Settings

[19:41] <TreyHarris> (On either doc or perl6-mode)

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> meanwhile I'm breaking some stuff here :)

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: now?

[19:44] <TreyHarris> checking

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> I'm deleting a bunch of teams on github :p

[19:44] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: yep, that did it

[19:44] <TreyHarris> thanks

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: you're welcome, let me know if you need anything else

[19:51] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: also I'm happy that you're interested in perl6-mode :)

[19:53] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: good, what's your biggest want for the mode?

[19:53] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: maybe if it understood indentation better when .foo:` method calls are used

[19:54] <TreyHarris> You mean `.foo:`? Do you mean like map colon curly block?

[19:56] <AlexDaniel> yeah, but I'm failing to reproduce it nowâ€¦

[19:56] <AlexDaniel> I remember it was super annoying though :)

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> OK, so the sakefile is now happy

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> awesome

[20:19] <tbrowder> TreyHarris: also, the HEREDOC handling is limited; would love to get a charmap on the menubar

[20:23] <TreyHarris> tbrowder: heredocs are really hard, as are POD6; since cperl-mode doesn't do well with those, either, I'm just aiming for parity first

[20:25] <TreyHarris> I actually think a productive line of investigation (for someone else!) would be to see if Org can be used for POD6 and heredocs; there are other invisible transcoders into and out of Org for files that contain more than one language where constructs can overlap (like having the opening brace in one sub-document and closing in another, with a closing brace that doesn't participate because it's not in a

[20:25] <TreyHarris> sub-document in-between)

[20:26] <TreyHarris> Sorry, I meant "Org-babel", not just plain "Org"
