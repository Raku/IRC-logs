[16:35] <vrurg> Is it possible to force rebuild moar/nqp by Configure.pl?

[17:16] <timotimo> yeah, just rm -rf their folders :P

[17:16] <timotimo> other than that you can just cd into their folders and "make clean"

[17:16] <timotimo> that should also do the trick

[17:26] <leont> Or git clean -dfx, I tend to trust that more (it also tends to be faster)

[17:43] *** ufobat joined
[17:56] <vrurg> Nothing of it works if nqp is in the path. 

[17:57] <vrurg> I had to wipe out the test installation directory.

[18:02] *** robertle joined
[18:05] <timotimo> oh, sorry, yeah, it checks the install directory, not the sources

[18:05] <timotimo> i haven't used --gen-* in many years

[18:12] <vrurg> I wonder what would it be the best way to test different combinations of moar/nqp? appveyor reported a problem on a build with stable moar and --gen-nqp=master and I needed to check it out.

[18:12] <timotimo> shareable6: help

[18:12] <shareable6> timotimo, Like this: shareable6: f583f22 # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Shareable

[18:12] <timotimo> wait

[18:12] <timotimo> that doesn't help you quite yet

[18:12] <timotimo> :|

[18:13] <timotimo> i mean, rakudobrew has the "triplet" command that lets you supply revisions for rakudo, nqp, and moar

[18:14] <vrurg> It does, but as I remember is doesn't make it possible to use my repository fork for rakudo itself.

[18:15] <timotimo> ah, i see

[18:16] <vrurg> I would probably generate a patch for Configure.pl with --force arg support.

[18:17] <vrurg> Unless wiping out the test installation won't bother me much. :)

[18:22] <timotimo> i mean it's similarly a one-liner to just cd into the folders, configure, and make install

[18:22] <timotimo> much simpler if you ask me

[18:28] <vrurg> Funny, but --gen-nqp and --gen-nqp=master are the same. Now I see no reason while appveyor passes with one and fails with another.

[21:06] <vrurg> If there is a language design question to discuss, where would be the best place to do it? perl6-language mailing list?

[21:10] <timotimo> that's probably a good place

[21:11] <timotimo> sometimes language design questions land on stackoverflow, too

[21:13] <vrurg> timotimo: thanks!

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: do you want to report a language design problem or are you just wondering why something is the way it is?

[21:15] <vrurg> A design problem. I'm working on a fix for #2250. Traced it down to add_method, but more general question is how submethods are to be handled when a role is applied.

[21:16] * vrurg will be gone for a while.
