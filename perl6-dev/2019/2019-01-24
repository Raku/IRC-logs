[02:17] <AlexDaniel> OK, some relatively not great news :)

[02:17] <AlexDaniel> I just got another set of results from Blin, there are more blockers

[02:17] <AlexDaniel> I think they somewhat hidden previously because of some changes in zef

[02:18] <AlexDaniel> that is, in the previous run Blin ignored some modules because they failed to install, or something like that

[02:33] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: if you like gists: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/13b77433ecfcf6478106bfab6fd6b8b4

[02:34] <timotimo> .o( gist gallop )

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ctrl+f Bisected

[02:36] <timotimo> the P6Repl::Helper problem is just testing output from an introspection for a sub that has since gotten return type annotations

[02:36] <timotimo> so LHF :)

[02:36] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I’m having that error on Red on a recent Rakudo version...

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: you mean this one? Red – Fail, Bisected: 2b948fc38b9d685104dd2f3f0b60de51e991b9fe

[02:37] <AlexDaniel> uhhh that bisect result makes no sense

[02:37] * AlexDaniel reruns that locally…

[02:39] <SmokeMachine> Hum!!! DateTime::Extended has no update for a long time...

[02:40] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: where have you found that bisect result?

[02:40] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: in the gist above: ctrl+f Bisected

[02:40] <AlexDaniel> but that looks very unrelated :)

[02:41] <SmokeMachine> (I’m on my cellphone...)

[02:41] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: anyway, I'm rerunning that for Red right now… will create a ticket soon!

[02:44] <SmokeMachine> Thanks!

[02:46] <timotimo> i'll go to sleep RSN

[03:19] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: not really. It did finish, but here's the bisect log: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/f0a2c564cb8eecd675b7701fa6c4a3eb

[03:20] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: TL;DR on two revisions it got MoarVM panic, so the final answer is irrelevant

[03:21] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: is it a common occurance that it panics during tests?

[03:22] <AlexDaniel> Blin attempts to deflap results, so apparently it succeeded 4 times in a row on 2018.12

[03:23] <AlexDaniel> so it's possible that we're looking at two issues, but more testing is needed

[03:24] *** MasterDuke joined
[03:24] *** MasterDuke left
[03:24] *** MasterDuke joined
[03:24] <SmokeMachine> No, that’s not common...

[03:27] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: you say it succeeded 4 times because it have tried 4 times or it has tried more times and only succeeded on 4?

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: it tried 4 times (actually 5) on 2018.12 and in all 5 runs tests were clean

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> so it classified it as a non-flapper (because it succeeds consistently on the old revision) and proceeded to bisect it

[03:30] <AlexDaniel> but during bisection it sometimes failed with (NoMatch) issue (what we're looking for) and sometimes failed with moarvm panic

[03:30] <SmokeMachine> So, the problem is some change on rakudo, right?! (And probably 2 different problems, right?)

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> which resulted in a useless answer :)

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> well, either it's the commit that introduced moarvm panics (which were later resolved?), or it's a completely random commit (more likely) :)

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: I'm running it again, so we'll get an answer eventually… well, we *have to* to get the answer before the release

[15:35] <scovit> I get 1 failure in 00-misc.t , with rakudo compiled --has-libffi , is it normal?

[15:55] <lizmat> aka s/mist.t/misc.t/ ?

[15:55] <scovit> yep

[15:56] <lizmat> that passes for me ok

[15:56] <lizmat> on MacOS High Sierra

[15:56] <scovit> I'm on Sierra but I guess that is not the difference

[15:56] <scovit> did you try --has-libffi ?

[15:57] <scovit> it is not the default

[15:57] <lizmat> ah, ok, no I didn't build with that

[15:57] <scovit> it is a moarvm option, but you need libffi installd

[15:57] <lizmat> where did you specify that --has-libffi ?

[15:58] <lizmat> ah...  well then I hope someone with that installed can help you further  

[15:58] * lizmat is in the middle of some other stuff

[15:58] <scovit> Ok, no-prob

[16:29] <scovit> lizmat, all, do not worry about that test: I foind out the reason it is not working here and it is a consequence of my hacking
