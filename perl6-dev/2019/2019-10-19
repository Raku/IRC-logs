[08:29] <samcv> so what's the deal with perl 6 being relocatable. I was talking with some perl people at the perl 5 core dev dinner and apparently there are still issues? if that can be fixed there's some others in addition to me that would try and get it usable at my work

[08:29] <tellable6> 2019-09-24T13:19:06Z #perl6 <vrurg> samcv regarding the list of modules â€“ here it is: https://gist.github.com/vrurg/010754a66f4b459e1dc2315bd6988ae3 Thanks for looking into this!

[22:31] <patrickb> .tell samcv I'd like to know what the problems with relocatability are. I wasn't aware of it not working. Can you elaborate a bit?

[22:31] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv
