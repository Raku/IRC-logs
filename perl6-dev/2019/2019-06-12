[07:58] <jmerelo> A question: is perl dependency so hard when building Perl 6? 

[07:59] <jmerelo> I see a lot of Extutils::Command there, but I'm not sure there's anything else... 

[07:59] <jmerelo> and it's mainly cp and mkpath...

[08:00] <jmerelo> well, also some tools in build/... I guess it's just convenient.
