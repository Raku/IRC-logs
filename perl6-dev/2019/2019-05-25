[17:30] <samcv> oh and this happened after it was running for days. so equally puzzling

[21:16] <lizmat> .tell vrurg I needed to do a "git submodule update" again before I could build after these last changes, perhaps we should automate that?

[21:39] <yoleaux> 21:16Z <lizmat> vrurg: I needed to do a "git submodule update" again before I could build after these last changes, perhaps we should automate that?

[21:46] <vrurg> .tell lizmat I can stick `git submodule update` into Configure.pl but imagine you have no Internet connection or an extremely slow one while trying to run it.

[21:46] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[21:46] <lizmat> .

[21:46] <yoleaux> 21:46Z <vrurg> lizmat: I can stick `git submodule update` into Configure.pl but imagine you have no Internet connection or an extremely slow one while trying to run it.

[21:47] <lizmat> most users would use packages, so this is only hurting developers and packagers

[21:47] <lizmat> both generally have adequate bandwidth generally

[21:48] <vrurg> BTW, you could try git config submodule.recurse true

[21:48] <lizmat> and is a git submodule update really that heavy network wise ?

[21:48] <lizmat> only if new stuff needs to be gotten, no ?

[21:48] <lizmat> vrurg: ^^

[21:48] <vrurg> Not when the connection is good.

[21:49] <vrurg> I just tried inserting the update command into the BEGIN block of Configure.pl and it seems to be unnoticable.

[21:52] <vrurg> Perhaps it'll make sense to add --init option which would also set git's submodule.recurse to true?

[21:52] <vrurg> We may also decide to use some standard git hooks in the future. --init would install them too.
