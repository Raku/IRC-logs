[01:09] <MasterDuke> timotimo: you around? travis failure above is in t/04-nativecall/06-struct.t, `moar(12380,0x7fffb3ce5340) malloc: *** error for object 0x7ffc7ff071d4: pointer being freed was not allocated *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug`

[01:09] <MasterDuke> not sure if that's new or not

[01:23] <timotimo> was a test added there recently?

[01:23] <timotimo> that's the problem where we don't track if a struct owns the pointer to its body or not

[01:27] <timotimo> well, it'd really be a CArray that causes the problem, since CStruct just never attempts to free its pointer, but CArray does

[01:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo: some more info here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1062

[01:33] <MasterDuke> last commit to that file was august 2018, f8b79306cc1900b7991490eef822480f304a56d9

[01:34] <timotimo> potentially floppy? just didn't get triggered before?

[01:35] <timotimo> an asan run or valgrind should have caught it since forever, unless of course that test is so late in the file that it doesn't gc before finishing

[01:35] <MasterDuke> yeah, it took a bunch of repetitions and a spectest running in the background

[01:36] <MasterDuke> i'm still in gdb, any other info to collect?

[01:54] <AlexDaniel> holy shit we just got a fast json parser in rakudo

[01:54] <AlexDaniel> IIRC that's going to help Blin a lot

[02:11] <vrurg> How do I map a type capture into it's actual type in terms of core/nqp?

[02:21] <MasterDuke> vrurg: 

[02:21] <MasterDuke> "map a type capture"?

[02:24] <vrurg> m: sub f (::T) { my T $i; say $i.WHAT }; f(Str)

[02:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 43ff9f1ce: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[02:25] <vrurg> MasterDuke: looking for a clean way to actually determine what is in T at runtime.

[02:29] <MasterDuke> vrurg: other than `T.WHAT`?

[02:32] <vrurg> MasterDuke: Yes, but .WHAT is a good starting point, actually. Basically, I need GenericHOW.instantiate_generic() as it seems. Now looking at how to get current type environment.

[02:40] <MasterDuke> vrurg: good luck. don't think i've ever looked at that stuff before, so i wouldn't be any help
