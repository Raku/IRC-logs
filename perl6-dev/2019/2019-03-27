[10:12] <pmurias> jnthn: any hints why there could be problems (it works on moar but is a problem with moar) with looking up setting thing in roles punned at compile time

[10:12] <pmurias> s/thing/things/

[10:12] <pmurias> jnthn: ?

[10:30] <jnthn> pmurias: I'd expect that'd have to be handled somehow by the role body fixup thing

[10:31] <jnthn> I'm not sure I get the "is a problem with moar" bit

[10:32] <pmurias> sorry mistyped, it's a problem with the js backend

[10:32] <jnthn> oh! OK, then it makes more sense :)

[10:32] <jnthn> I wonder if it's something wrong but then moar's autoclose hack to cope with these situations "fixes" it...

[14:17] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[14:17] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Before, such a parameter would show up as "[--foo=<Positional>]", which

[14:17] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: although technically correct, is not very useful.  Now it will appear as

[14:17] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: "[--foo=<Any> ...]".  Sadly, specifying constraints on :@foo, like "Str :@foo"

[14:17] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: currently does not work.

[20:07] <patrickb> Now that the spaces in build path thing has turned out a "little" more complex I now try to get my fixes to make i work on Windows again out first and only afterwards have another look at the spaces thing.
