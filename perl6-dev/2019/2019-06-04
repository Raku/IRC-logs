[10:23] <Guest12727> lizmat: I believe that vrurg was working on that problem

[10:23] <lizmat> I hope so

[10:23] <lizmat> anyways, I nuked my install dir and now I got a working perl 6 again

[10:23] <Guest12727> cool

[10:24] <lizmat> con: I needed to reinstall all of the modules that I had installed :-(

[10:27] <patrickb> lizmat: That's the commit that should fix that problem: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/32b774de5890ee53fa2cd70f1862659f9b208a94

[10:28] <lizmat> patrickb: good to know it will be fixed soon in rakudo :-)

[10:28] * lizmat will be offline for a few hours

[10:28] <patrickb> lizmat: That commit already is in

[10:28] <lizmat> also in rakudo?

[10:29] <patrickb> As far as I understand it there is noting to do in rakudo. It's NQP that has a problem with moar.

[13:37] <jnthn> I just built latest NQP/Rakudo and installed them, and the installed perl6 now seems to explode with:

[13:37] <jnthn> Unhandled exception: Missing or wrong version of dependency '/home/jnthn/dev/MoarVM/install/share/nqp/lib/MAST/Nodes.nqp' (from 'src/Perl6/Pod.nqp')

[13:37] <jnthn>    at <unknown>:1  (/home/jnthn/dev/MoarVM/install/share/nqp/lib/Perl6/Pod.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)

[13:38] <jnthn> I built/installed HEAD of everything

[13:42] <jnthn> make realclean in both did nothing to help

[13:43] <jnthn> (and fresh builds afterwards)

[13:45] <vrurg> --gen-*=master for both?

[13:46] <jnthn> I don't want to generate anything

[13:46] <jnthn> I have MoarVM/, nqp/, and rakudo/ side by side, and a conf.sh script in the latter two that runs `perl Configure.pl --prefix=/home/jnthn/dev/MoarVM/install`

[13:47] <jnthn> Which is the prefix the MoarVM build installs into

[13:47] <jnthn> Curiously, doing `rm /home/jnthn/dev/MoarVM/install/share/nqp/lib/Perl6/*` and a re-install worked

[13:48] <jnthn> And that folder is empty after install

[13:48] <jnthn> Did the Perl 6 modules written in NQP start getting installed in a different place?

[13:48] <vrurg> I'll try to reproduce. But most likely its something about yesterday's patrickb merges.

[13:48] <jnthn> And then it picks up on the previous location ahead of the new one?

[13:49] <vrurg> Could be. I know patrick was working on separating installation directories. Didn't know he merged it already.

[13:50] <patrickb> I'm looking that up. Give me a moment.

[13:50] <patrickb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/34476c3a95376d2a2846fadcfa875b0363cd2986

[13:50] <patrickb> That's the commit.

[13:51] <patrickb> jnthn: Indeed, as you speculated. The libs in share/nqp/lib/Perl6 were moved to share/perl6/lib/Perl6

[13:52] <patrickb> There was quite some discussion around that change. I didn't expect any breakage though...

[13:52] <jnthn> Hm, curious, in that the reasoning for it being the way it was is that the Perl 6 compiler is just an NQP library

[13:53] <jnthn> I think the breakage is because it's continuing to look in the previous location even after a new install

[13:53] <patrickb> It does and needs to, because NQPs files are still located there.

[13:53] <vrurg> patrickb: perhaps the order is to be changed?

[13:53] <patrickb> Ah! I get it, the old files of the previous install that would have been overwritten are still there.

[13:54] <jnthn> Right, but if people already have installs then...right, that.

[13:54] <patrickb> Ugh.. :-(  How do we fix that?

[13:55] <patrickb> A Makefile bit that cleans out the old install location? I'm unsure how good an idea that is...

[13:56] <jnthn> "because NQPs files are still located there" - yes, the logic being that Rakudo's NQP components *are* NQP files, and so should be put where NQP module loading would find them.

[13:56] <vrurg> patrickb: A warning? Check for their existence and print a message.

[13:56] <jnthn> I'm not quite sure what problem the change is trying to solve, or if it just misunderstood the intention of how things were

[13:57] <patrickb> jnthn: The problem this change tries to fix is that when installing rakudo and nqp into different prefixes rakudo would need to write stuff into NQPs prefix folder.

[13:57] <patrickb> jnthn: That's conceptually shady and makes it impossible to cleanly build rakudo on NimOS where each package is separate from each other.

[13:59] <patrickb> Several ideas came up to solve this. Among them having a second share/nqp/lib folder in rakudos prefix and installing into there.

[13:59] <jnthn> How does it handle packaging libraries for languages?

[13:59] <patrickb> I think they wrote their own linker

[14:00] <patrickb> For C that is.

[14:00] <patrickb> I'm not that proficient in Nim though.

[14:02] <patrickb> The idea of a second share/nqp/lib folder breaks the concept of having an NQP home folder (share/nqp) and a Perl 6 home folder (share/perl6). Because in the case of two different prefixes there are two share/nqp/lib folders.

[14:03] <patrickb> In short the solution we came up with, was installing the Perl 6 libs (written in NQP) into the share/perl6/lib folder. That does change the semantics of the folders from "stuff written in NQP/Perl6" to "stuff that's part of NQP/Perl6".

[14:07] <patrickb> s/nim/nix/g

[14:14] <patrickb> I think checking for the existence of files in share/nqp/lib/Perl6 and Warning is a first step. In addition we could delete these files automatically. Hopefully we can in the long run remove that logic again as a "delete stuff in some seemingly unrelated folder somewhere" is nothing we want to keep in the long run.

[14:15] <patrickb> Still an ugly solution.

[14:15] <patrickb> jnthn, vrurg, nine, ugexe:  I'm open for suggetions. If necessary also entirely different approaches.

[14:16] <ugexe> *something something sha1*

[14:20] <vrurg> patrickb: the warning is something for Configure.pl. It must do the check as the last step right after expanding Makefile.

[14:20] <patrickb> On a related note: I'd also really like to finish up https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2940 before the next release as I'd like to limit the breakage by changing basic stuff to a single release.

[14:23] <vrurg> ugexe: how do you propose to use hashing in this case?

[14:26] <ugexe> vrurg: it is a bit of an inside joke where we pretend sha1 are the answer to any problem

[14:27] <vrurg> :D :D

[14:29] <ugexe> patrickb: it looks fine to me, but i'm not one to approve without a green build (even though the current failure isn't associated with that PR)
