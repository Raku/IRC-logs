[07:50] <lizmat> Files=1274, Tests=109496, 204 wallclock secs (26.42 usr  7.69 sys + 2868.71 cusr 257.75 csys = 3160.57 CPU)

[08:57] * lizmat is at a bit of a conundrum

[08:59] <lizmat> t/spec/*/sprintf-*.t contains tests for sprintf that I created earlier this year

[08:59] <lizmat> it codifies errors in the nqp implementation of sprintf

[08:59] <lizmat> I'm now working on a new Perl 6 based sprintf implementation, which should be according to the POSIX book

[09:00] <lizmat> this now sits in a branch and I plan to make that part of 6.e

[09:01] <lizmat> the new implementation is both more correct and more extensive than before

[09:02] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf(q/%2$4d/,42)   # this should throw, not produce wrong data

[09:02] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar fce964231: OUTPUT: ¬´"   0"‚ê§¬ª

[09:03] <lizmat> since these new tests were not part of 6.d, it feels I should just change them

[09:03] <lizmat> but the new implementation is only active with "use v6.e.PREVIEW"

[09:03] <lizmat> should I just put that in the test files until the release ??

[09:04] <nine> I'd say do so and yes

[09:07] <jnthn> Yes; we previously had test files with `use v6.d.PREVIEW` for non-blocking await and similar, then tossed it when we did the next language release.

[09:08] <lizmat> ok, will take that route then

[09:08] <lizmat> jnthn: also ok on making that 6.e specific?

[09:09] <lizmat> the new sprintf implementation, I mean ?

[09:09] <jnthn> lizmat: I don't know. :)

[09:09] <jnthn> lizmat: I guess there's enough breaking changes you feel that we can't just put it in place of the original impl?

[09:10] <lizmat> yeah, the nqp implementation has quite some quirks when mixing parameters

[09:11] <lizmat> which make it non-POSIX compliant

[09:13] <jnthn> OK

[09:13] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf("%-08.2f",2.71)

[09:13] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar fce964231: OUTPUT: ¬´"0002.710"‚ê§¬ª

[09:13] <jnthn> Then yeah, it's probably sensible

[09:38] <lizmat> "fatal: cannot rebase with locally recorded submodule modifications"   WTF ?

[09:40] <lizmat> ARGH

[09:41] <lizmat> seems I've gotten myself into git submodule / branch hell

[09:42] <lizmat> so I have a branch "new-sprintf", which I deleted locally to make sure no strange things

[09:42] <lizmat> I build rakudo from master with fill Configure.pl

[09:44] <nine> Does a git submodule update before the rebase help?

[09:47] <lizmat> feels I just repeated the steps I did before, but now it works  :-(

[09:55] <lizmat> argh, no, making changes to the new Sprintf file doesn't trigger a re-compile

[10:01] <lizmat> fatal: cannot rebase with locally recorded submodule modifications

[10:01] <lizmat> argh

[13:11] <vrurg> Guest15407: did you resolve it?

[13:11] <vrurg> nine: thanks for spotting, I'll get it fixed later today.

[13:15] <Guest15407> vrurg: yeah, I removed the old installation and rebuilt everything

[13:16] <vrurg> Guest15407: ok.

[13:26] <vrurg> lizmat: regarding your submodule problem, what does git status reports?

[13:27] <lizmat> nothing anymore since ditching the branch and restarting it *after* the submodule changes

[13:27] <lizmat> it mumbled something about "cannot rebase with locally recorded submodule modifications"

[13:28] <lizmat> git status then said there were changes that I hadn't (consciously) made

[13:29] <Guest15407> vrurg, now that many changes have been made to the build does that affect how we should update to a new version of a submodule, e.g. libuv?

[13:30] <Guest15407> previously we have checked out the new version in the lib uv dir, after that we've moved to the MoarVM dir and 'git add' the entire libuv dir

[13:31] <Guest15407> does that still work?

[13:31] *** anatofuz left
[13:32] <vrurg> Guest15407: the changes are in rakudo build only for now. I also plan doing similar changes to NQP. libuv is a part of MoarVM where I done nothing.

[13:34] <Guest15407> vrurg, thx for the information

[13:36] <vrurg> BTW, what people think about using cmake? Does it worth spending time on learning it or we'd stick to perl6 Configure?

[13:39] <jdv79> any idea how many more times building will be broken?  i think this is the third time lately for me.

[13:41] <nine> vrurg: what issue would a move fix?

[13:43] <jdv79> https://nopaste.xyz/?e1fbce71f249ce2e#5p8Jx1ISjEHvriuTFeowQLLLzWVLl7eZ3Sf9Suo4Qb0=

[13:43] <vrurg> nine: Getting rid of perl5. Nothing else. This was discussed back in May/June, but so far no other solution is good enough for this task.

[13:44] <vrurg> jdv79: you nqp-configure submodule didn't get updated. Though I wonder how did you get around implicit recursive submodules update which Configure.pl sets for you?

[13:45] <jdv79> i didn't do anything outside of what is in that paste afaik

[13:46] <vrurg> jdv79: aha, looks like you have changes in the submodule and it rejects to update it.

[13:46] <vrurg> M	3rdparty/nqp-configure 

[13:46] <jdv79> i made no changes

[13:46] <vrurg> jdv79: could you cd 3rdparty/nqp-configure; git status?

[13:48] <jdv79> https://nopaste.xyz/?8021e52ffdae654b#udG+2MLQvGD7hvWRYkhkJ54YJu2KXVvZHFp2p6xvVDc=

[13:48] <jdv79> idk much about submodules but it seems an issue wrt to that

[13:48] <lizmat> afk&

[13:48] *** lizmat left
[13:51] <vrurg> jdv79: try just manually run git submodule update. Should help. The problem is that git pull --rebase reject updating submodules if encounters a problem.

[13:54] <jdv79> ok.  idk what the problem would be.  i don't edit that checkout - that update routine is the extent of what i do with that checkout aside from run `perl6` so it wasn't something i did in there.

[13:57] <Guest15407> jdv79, I had that problem yesterday. I nuked my Rakudo install and started from scratch.

[14:00] *** Kaiepi joined
[14:00] <jdv79> the submodule update seems to have worked.  i would prefer to at least try to learn than just blow stuff up.

[14:02] <Guest15407> indeed, I just got impatient :)

[14:04] <vrurg> jdv79: unfortunately, I'm of little help here because I don't use rebase (though I should perhaps). Just know that it's quite subtle and easily fails on submodules.

[14:04] <vrurg> BTW, can anyone with macos try to replicate R#3100 locally?
