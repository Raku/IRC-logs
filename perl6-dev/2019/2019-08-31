[02:41] <sortiz> AlexDaniel: About the perl6 github org, I think it's safer to first create the new org and then transfer the repos one by one. See https://help.github.com/en/articles/transferring-a-repository (I can't comment there)

[02:42] <AlexDaniel> sortiz: hmm… but why is that safer?

[02:43] <sortiz> The redirects are automatic and no risk to old be taken by others.

[02:43] <sortiz> *the old

[02:43] <AlexDaniel> won't transferring the whole org result in same redirects?

[02:45] <sortiz> You mention the "API requests" problem, it don't exist in this case.

[02:46] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[02:46] <AlexDaniel> interesting

[02:47] <sortiz> And no one have to rush :-) 

[02:49] <AlexDaniel> sortiz: thanks

[02:50] <AlexDaniel> sortiz: there are also teams and other org level stuff, but it's not a big deal to move that

[02:51] <AlexDaniel> moreover it's an opportunity to clean teams and permissions :)

[02:51] <sortiz> And may be some "historic" repos don't need to be moved.

[02:52] <AlexDaniel> naaaaah I don't want a yet another github organization…

[02:52] <AlexDaniel> so I'd much rather move everything

[02:55] <sortiz> Yep, but we don't need to burn the ships in one day.

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> … what?

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> ah right, one of the moar commits, sure

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/0e7599e756e6c720070f0dbe345bd3a17274fe14 ?

[15:41] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¦63a4d958eec^: «False␤»

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> if we return False for negative numbers then maybe it makes sense to do that in rakudo

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> and also… tests…

[15:51] <dogbert17> indeed

[15:52] <dogbert17> feels like the message is a bit off as well

[15:59] <dogbert17> t/spec/S32-num/is-prime.t has quite a few tests, not for -1 though

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> I think it's off cuz https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1130#issuecomment-507875642

[19:54] <bartolin> I was hunting a very strange error on the JVM backend for the last days. I'm about to give up now, but reported my findings as R#3158. One last question, though: Does anybody have an idea, how %DEPRECATIONS from (Rakudo::Deprecations) could get populated -- apart from 'method DEPRECATED' being called?

[23:39] <vrurg> .tell jnthn I was thinking about 'NULL.<rev>' used to distinguish currently compilng language revision. Perhaps we just need a command line switch(es) --lang-ver / --lang-rev?

[23:57] <tbrowder> on the zef website nick shot down my feature request due to possible changes in formats with raku version changes. i, blindly, have been installing new versions of raku into the same location, so maybe that has caused some hidden problems. i need some good guidance on how best to install, and upgrade, a system-wide rakudo.
