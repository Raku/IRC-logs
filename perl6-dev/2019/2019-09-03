[13:15] <pmurias> Kaiepi: ahh I see you reintroduced that as something that makes more sense

[13:17] <Kaiepi> reintroduced what?

[13:22] <vrurg> pmurias: pong

[13:34] <pmurias> vrurg: you are having build troubles with some rakudo.js dep on freebsd?

[13:36] <vrurg> gyp fails because it wants python27. I don't want EOLed product be the default. We don't agree on this. :)

[13:36] <pmurias> vrurg: I commited a Makefile.in that works on my machine but if there are unportable things still in that I can fix them

[13:37] <pmurias> vrurg: any ideas how that can be fixed?

[13:38] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: vrurg++ created pull request #3166: [WIP] [HEADSUP] Extract common parts of backend makefiles into a common template

[13:38] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3166

[13:39] <pmurias> vrurg: do they depend on the default python being python2 or are you opposed to installing it?

[13:41] <vrurg> pmurias: I was sending you an email with output. Shall I do it again?

[13:45] <vrurg> pmurias: BTW, what I do now is even bigger change to makefiles. Look at the PR above, it's an intermidiate state of things but it currently builds (not installs) moar backend.

[13:51] <pmurias> vrurg: I'll search for it in my gmail inbox

[13:54] <pmurias> vrurg: found the email, missed it :(

[13:54] <vrurg> pmurias: macports install python2.7, not python2

[13:54] <pmurias> (I need to get round to setting up my gmail inbox so it's not overfilled with github emails and other spam)

[13:55] <vrurg> Actually, I can switch active python and I plan to do it for finalizing JS part of reworking makefiles. But that' weird that we can't build without an outdated thing.

[13:55] <pmurias> vrurg: I looked into that a bit and the whole thing seems to be weird

[13:56] *** titsuki joined
[13:56] <pmurias> I'll try to find what dep is using the python stuff and see if we can get rid of it

[13:59] <pmurias> vrurg: with the js backend now using a Makefile.in, the shared template stuff should be easier for you?

[14:03] <vrurg> pmurias: I think it would be. Though the changes are so dramatic, that I'm not sure how much difference does it make. :)

[14:04] <vrurg> But less "parsing" of NQP is definitely a plus, thanks you!

[14:21] <pmurias> vrurg: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/526#issuecomment-64887659

[14:21] <pmurias> vrurg: maybe something like that could help

[14:22] <vrurg> pmurias: thanks, trying!

[14:23] <vrurg> Still, I consider it strange that people rely on something oficially deprecated long ago. But who we are to judge? ;)
