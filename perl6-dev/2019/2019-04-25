[13:47] <vrurg> patrickb: did you try building my branch on your windows setup?

[13:53] <patrickb> vrurg: I didn't. Do you want me to?

[13:54] <vrurg> patrickb: I could have fixed the same problem with the runners already.

[13:56] <patrickb> vrurg: There were several fixes involving the bat runners.

[13:57] <vrurg> Ok, hopefully I'll have time to look into it later today.

[13:58] * vrurg made a great mistake of pushing the merge.

[14:03] <patrickb> Things that got fixed: - The build runners now work irrespective of CWD. - The build runners don't prefer files in the install dir over files in the build dir. - The build runners are relocatable.

[14:04] <patrickb> vrurg: You can always just force-push over. It's not in rakudo/rakudo yet.

[14:08] <vrurg> patrickb: Thanks! I'll get through it as soon as have time. I was elimitaning CWD dependency in my work too. Not the other two tasks.
