[14:54] <timotimo> dogbert17: have another try

[14:55] <dogbert17> timotimo: it works, yay :)

[15:00] <timotimo> no clue why it stopped working; the process was still there, but i don't think it was writing a log file or anything

[15:07] <dogbert17> cool, I didn't know that jnthn's talks from GPW 2019 had been posted to youtube

[15:10] <timotimo> oh nice

[15:11] <timotimo> youtube is giving me everything, but nothing related to gpw or jonathan m)

[15:12] <timotimo> i missed one of jonathan's two talks, so the recording will be a good opportunity to catch up

[15:13] <timotimo> ooh, jnthn, that german was pretty good at the start :)

[18:49] <gfldex> are dynamic vars implemented with stack magic?

[18:55] <timotimo> yes

[20:50] <jnthn> I didn't know the videos had been posted either... Nice :)

[20:50] <jnthn> I know I was mic'd up with a second one for the recording, so hopefully the sound came out reasonable.

[20:50] <jnthn> timotimo: Wow, I was sure it was like, epic fail :)

[21:02] <timotimo> you messed up "schlecht" to make it sound much more like "schleckt" instead ;)

[21:03] <timotimo> huh, i wonder why youtube shows "includes paid promotion" here? is that because the sponsors sponsored the conference and put their logos on the video?
