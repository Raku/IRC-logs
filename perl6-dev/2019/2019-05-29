[02:22] <yoleaux> 28 May 2019 20:28Z <[Tux]> vrurg: I changed the config.status calls with perl calls as stored in those files. Still fails. No time to dig, not time to file ticket: Im on holiday the next two weeks and $work claimed all time for this week

[02:24] <vrurg> .tell [Tux] I was just informing you about the config.status. Anyway, it is fixed now as well as the other problem. Your script should be functional again now.

[03:40] <AlexDaniel> since when do we have two identically named Net::ZMQ modules

[03:41] <AlexDaniel> I remember there being two of them, but they had different names…

[03:58] <AlexDaniel> also I think Cro::ZeroMQ no longer works…

[03:58] <AlexDaniel> not sure why, maybe because I have zmq 5

[04:00] <AlexDaniel> ah no, it's called ZMQ4 but it actually does `is native('zmq',v5)`, fun!

[06:00] <bartolin> lizmat: I've just seen that 'make install' fails for the JVM backend, because it tries to use nqp::mvmstartprofile. Maybe you could have a look how to avoid that? It dies in instll-core-dist.p6 (where MoarVM::Profiler is part of %provides)

[11:51] <timotimo> any reason not to bump rakudo's nqp dependency right away?

[12:08] *** llfourn left
[12:30] *** skids joined
[12:37] <ugexe> i wonder if we'll need to figure out conditional dependencies to properly not include MoarVM::Profiler on install

[12:37] <ugexe> so that people can write stuff using MoarVM::Profiler while also allowing the dependency graph to be completed when running zef on jvm (which doesn't work yet anyway so no hurry)

[12:39] <ugexe> there was syntax for one-of via "depends" : [ "Req", [ "A", "B" ] ] (which also doesn't work yet) but nothing to say "only install this dependency if ..."

[12:41] <timotimo> also looking forward to functioning "emulates" support; btw, has there been a design draft for a "separate installations of everything for specific projects/programs" solution like virtualenv/pipenv or carton or whatever?

[12:41] <timotimo> surely the idea has been discussed a few times

[12:53] <ugexe> functioning emulates support exists... still missing some details to handle anything but the most basic workings https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2732

[12:53] *** leont joined
[12:54] <ugexe> all its really missing is the namespace parser (like a 10 line grammer in zef) and a way to upgrade the precomp meta data file format on upgrade from an older rakudo

[12:56] <ugexe> as for separate installations there is `zef install Foo --deps-only --contained --install-to=inst#local/lib` although --contained is very much beta and really only works if your installation succeeds the first time (otherwise you'd need to nuke local/lib and start over)

[12:58] <ugexe> --contained basically means "ignore installed dependencies", which combined with --install-to=... gives most of the desired behavior

[12:58] <timotimo> sounds like a good start

[13:00] <ugexe> in the future it will grab e.g. Test/NativeCall etc from the local site repo and install those into the self contained repo as well

[13:01] <ugexe> but that will require https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2778 :P

[13:03] <ugexe> which is also stuck at upgrading meta data when upgrading rakudo

[13:04] <timotimo> that's far above my paygrade :(

[13:11] <ugexe> upgrading meta data is easy enough. it is a question of how it should be handled, notably for distro packages where installed files (like the meta data for Test, NativeCall, or any modules also installed via dist package) shouldn't be modified externally

[13:11] <timotimo> yeah

[13:21] <ugexe> or even rakudo itself for sorting the chosen module version

[13:21] <timotimo> oh, interesting

[13:37] *** leont left
[13:41] <vrurg> .tell [Tux] there're couple possible causes to your problem: repo stuck in some messed up state; Makefile is not regenerated. The latter could be caused if your config.state contains --expand. Try running Configure.pl manually once.
