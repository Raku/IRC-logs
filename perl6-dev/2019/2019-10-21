[08:56] <patrickb> .tell samcv What is a specfile? It it something rakudo should provide?

[08:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv

[08:56] <tellable6> 2019-10-17T18:29:20Z #perl6 <nine> patrickb Even when Inline::Perl5 is installed make spectest will claim that it is not and therefore not run the Perl 5 integration tests

[08:56] <tellable6> 2019-10-20T07:52:57Z #perl6-dev <samcv> patrickb i was not sure either, but i'll let you know when I find out. do we have any centos/redhat specfile's for the relocatable builds?

[08:56] <patrickb> .tell samcv To do a relocatable build you need to pass the `--relocatable` parameter to the Configure.pl script. Also all three, MoarVM, NQP and Rakudo need to be installed to the same `--prefix` for it to work. After all three are compiled and installed, you should be able to move the installation around. Packages you install in that installation

[08:56] <patrickb> are moved with it.

[08:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv

[08:56] <patrickb> .tell samcv I also hope we'll be able to provide pre-built packages with the next compiler release. It has not been finally decided yet whether we'll provide pre-built packages with every monthly compiler release though.

[08:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv

[08:56] <patrickb> .tell samcv I have tested relocatable builds to some extent, but there is no real life usage yet. I what to make this work robustly, so please do share any problems you hit.

[08:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv

[08:56] <patrickb> .tell samcv Did your coworker maybe hit issue 2 in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3090 ? I.e. did he trip over DESTDIR not working? If yes that problem should be fixed by now and is also not related to relocatability. (Actually I recommend doing a non-relocatable build for distribution packages.)

[08:56] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to samcv

[08:57] <patrickb> .tell samcv Could you also join #raku and #raku-dev ?
