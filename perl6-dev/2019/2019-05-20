[12:50] <tyil[m]> additionally, I'm looking into the k8s rescheduler, which should help in keeping the cluster more balanced, so not everything falls over whenever the server provider is having network troubles

[19:42] <vrurg> Perhaps we need a hook which would force update modules on pulls.

[21:40] <lizmat> which is what came with XCode on Mojave apparently

[21:41] <vrurg> oops.... I always install from MacPorts. Hombrew has it too.

[21:43] <vrurg> Re-clone will do too. I'm gonna merge the same for rakudo too today.

[21:44] <vrurg> It is not critical though because github redirects to a transferred repo when referned at its old location. So, vrurg/nqp-configure will work anyway.

[22:00] <vrurg> lizmat: What is strange is that my `/usr/bin/git --version` gives me `git version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)`

[22:00] <lizmat> hmmm... intriguing

[22:00] <lizmat> mine does as well

[22:01] <vrurg> `which git`? Could it be that you have remains of archaic installation somehow?

[22:02] <lizmat> yeah, looks like

[22:02] * vrurg has no idea where to get git 1.X to try.

[22:02] <lizmat> but moving that out of the way makes me be without git altogether  :-(

[22:03] <lizmat> ah, I need to renew my shell

[22:05] <vrurg> '/usr/bin/git submodule update --init --recursive --remote' works for me. Actually, visually it does nothing but it's because nothing to be done already.

[22:05] <lizmat> ok, confirmed it works with 2.21

[22:06] <lizmat> also confirmed that a clean clone works ok

[22:07] <vrurg> Actually, by re-cloning I meant the clean one.

[22:08] <vrurg> I'm thinking of what'd be better: have Configure.pl setup git so it would update submodules on each pull. Or add an option to Configure.pl which would force manual update.

[22:15] * lizmat likes things to be automated :-)

[22:19] <vrurg> So do I. Basically here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4611512/is-there-a-way-to-make-git-pull-automatically-update-submodules ‚Äì they tell you how to turn it on in git config.
