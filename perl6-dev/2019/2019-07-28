[07:22] <AlexDaniel> note that there are no nqp-configure changes in the point release

[08:15] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: +1 from me

[09:53] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: I assume this never worked? https://github.com/perl6/nqp/issues/567

[10:47] <timotimo> oh, yeah, that probably never worked right

[10:51] <chloekek> I wonder how you'd write a regression test for that.

[11:00] <timotimo> it's currently using nqp::backendconfig()<prefix> which grabs the prefix from moarvm, indeed

[11:01] <timotimo> the Compiler object has a %!config that seems to have the right prefix in it, the one for nqp

[11:02] <timotimo> but i don't see an obvious way for the Backend, which is where the profiler template is searched, to get at it at the moment

[11:22] <timotimo> chloekek: can you test a patch? https://gist.github.com/timo/e66b190dfde09806f8757a4ce81f1fa7 - this would apply to nqp

[11:29] <chloekek> It did find the template but it did not create the profiling output.

[11:31] <chloekek> Oh, maybe $nqpconfig<prefix> doesn't exist.

[15:55] <timotimo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3082 - who wants this to hit master?

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> btw what's Stage syntaxcheck and Stage ast

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> if it's always taking 0.000s there's probably no need to show it

[15:59] <timotimo> they don't do anything much

[15:59] <timotimo> but we just go through the stages one by one and call them; each stage is just a method

[15:59] <timotimo> syntaxcheck is for when you run your code with -c

[15:59] <timotimo> that sets the --target=syntaxcheck i think?

[16:00] <timotimo> and the way syntaxcheck outputs is to say "Syntax OK"

[16:03] <timotimo> and ast takes the .ast of the .parse and returns that as result i think?

[16:03] <timotimo> because the next stage works on the .ast, rather than the match?

[16:03] <timotimo> more importantly, if you --target=ast, you get the ast, whereas if you --target=parse you get the match
