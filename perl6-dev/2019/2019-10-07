[19:14] <hankache> hello #prt;6

[19:15] <hankache> #oerl6

[19:15] <hankache> aghhh #perl6

[19:15] <hankache> what does --moar-option="--ld=link" do?

[19:22] <MasterDuke> hankache: uses the `link` linker instead of the `ld` linker

[19:24] <hankache> thanks MasterDuke. Bu default it is what?

[19:25] <hankache> if I omit the option?

[19:25] <hankache> and why would I chose link instead of ld?

[19:26] <MasterDuke> i think `ld` is the default. some might be faster, or have better support for doing LTO (link time optimization)

[19:27] <hankache> hmmm

[19:27] <hankache> thanks

[19:27] <MasterDuke> but this isn't an area where i would consider myself very knowledgeable, so take what i'm saying with a grain of salt

[19:27] <hankache> I am encountering a very weird issue

[19:28] <hankache> if I build Rakudo 2019.07.1 using: perl Configure.pl --backends=moar --gen-moar --moar-option="--cc=cl" --moar-option="--ld=link" --moar-option="--make=nmake" --relocatable

[19:28] <hankache> A test of LWP::Simple fails

[19:29] <hankache> If I build it with: perl Configure.pl --backends=moar --gen-moar --moar-option="--cc=gcc" --moar-option="--make=gmake" --relocatable

[19:29] <hankache> it works

[19:29] <hankache> PS: OS Windows 10

[19:30] <MasterDuke> you can't use --moar-option="--ld=link" with gcc?

[19:30] <hankache> No clue. Never tried before

[19:30] <MasterDuke> or conversely, --moar-option="--cc=cl" without --moar-option="--ld=link"?

[19:30] <hankache> I should try to narrow it down

[19:31] <hankache> but I was curious what this option does hence my question initially

[19:32] <hankache> Let me try and come back

[19:32] <hankache> brb

[19:32] <MasterDuke> hm. might want to ask in #moarvm, seems like a c toolchain problem (i.e., likely not a problem in rakudo itself, but with how moarvm is built)

[19:32] <MasterDuke> timotimo or nine or brrt or jnthn might have some ideas

[19:33] <hankache> ok

[19:33] <hankache> thanks

[19:34] <MasterDuke> np

[19:57] <hankache> I confirm, when using --moar-option="--ld=link" one of the tests of LWP::Simple fails
