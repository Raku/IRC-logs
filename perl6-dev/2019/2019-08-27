[00:48] <vrurg> moar's HEAD is not compatible with travis anymore.

[00:50] <timotimo> whoops

[00:51] <vrurg> tools/expr-template-compiler.pl requires perl 5.20, they provide 5.18 for darwin.

[00:51] <vrurg> Right, this is macos default for perl.

[00:51] <timotimo> :|

[00:51] <timotimo> does the darwin perl 5.18 come with List::Utils with whatever the template compiler needs?

[00:53] <vrurg> Can't locate List/Utils.pm

[00:53] <vrurg> No, as it seems.

[01:02] <vrurg> Ok, it is now ready for the new Grammar in 6.e...

[01:02] <timotimo> time to put perlbrew in the travis config?!

[01:03] <vrurg> timotimo: yes, if it is possible. 5.18 is so much ancient...

[01:04] <timotimo> i think perlbrew has one of these "curl this into your sh and you're good to go" kind of deals :P

[01:04] <vrurg> it does indeed.

[01:05] <vrurg> Though I barely got it working with macos. So, it could be tricky if possible at all.

[01:05] <timotimo> oh no :(

[01:06] <timotimo> BanzaiMan commented on 15 Nov 2018

[01:06] <timotimo> Closing for now, as support based on Perlbrew is unlikely to be worked on soon.

[01:07] <timotimo> https://github.com/travis-perl/helpers - also a thing that exists apparently

[01:08] <vrurg> Maybe plenv? I haven't tried it though.

[01:09] <vrurg> Interesting, but the perlbrew I have only displays list of cperls as available...

[01:09] <timotimo> i'll be going to bed RSN

[01:10] <vrurg> timotimo: then good news for the night: I'm about to merge the new Grammar with Failure on parse today.

[01:10] <vrurg> unless something goes wrong.

[01:10] <timotimo> noice

[01:10] <timotimo> does it also already have some interesting info about the parse failure?

[01:10] <timotimo> or just the type change so far?

[01:10] <vrurg> use v6.e.PREVIEW only, apparently.

[01:11] <timotimo> that's still good

[01:11] <vrurg> It's merge of the old Larry commit.

[01:11] <vrurg> I didn't really check what's in it.

[01:13] <vrurg> Seemingly, it provides more details. 

[01:16] <vrurg> .tell pmurias R#3138 breaks js backend build because the directory structure and build process of COREs are changed. Unfortunately, I can't fix JS. Please, get in touch with me if you need any assistance with this.
