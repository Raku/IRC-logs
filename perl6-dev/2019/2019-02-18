[01:01] <MasterDuke> ugh, i have some free time and kind of want to do some hacking, but am just too tired to think. i keep flipping back and forth looking at QRegex/Cursor.nqp and QAST/Regex.nqp and QRegex/NFA.nqp hoping for inspiration to strike

[01:02] <MasterDuke> think it's time to go play some Moss or Disgae 5 instead...

[01:02] <timotimo> disgaea 5! i loved that game ... then i moved to a new apartment and haven't seen the disc since :(

[01:02] <timotimo> i don't know what Moss is, though

[01:03] <MasterDuke> psvr game. sort of a puzzle/platformer

[01:03] <timotimo> ah, psvr is kind of neat

[01:03] <timotimo> i've been watching loads of linux.conf.au talks today and there was one about vr and vulkan on linux

[01:03] <timotimo> the bloke has been working on psvr support for openhmd i think?

[01:04] <MasterDuke> i really like the presentation, you're mostly stationary as the player, looking into set scenes, but certain secrets are only visible if you move you head around to look behind things and such

[01:04] <MasterDuke> yeah, i've heard that's in the works

[01:04] <timotimo> my dad got a psvr for christmas, i got to play some wipeout on it

[01:04] <MasterDuke> and i think it was the original disgae that was the reason i bought a ps2

[01:05] <MasterDuke> superhot is fantastic. i haven't played it on any other platform, but i can't imagine how it would be nearly as good not in vr

[01:05] <timotimo> i never owned a ps2; the first time i played a disgaea it was Disgaea DS, which is a port of the first one (but it's not very good)

[01:06] <MasterDuke> i think i may have accidentally skipped 4, but i've put a bunch of hours into the rest

[01:06] <timotimo> 4 was the second one i played, after that came DD2

[01:07] <MasterDuke> beat saber is a fun rhythm game that also only works in vr

[01:07] <timotimo> i've heard of it, but i didn't actually look at it yet. i imagine it can be quite a workout :)

[01:07] <MasterDuke> don't think it would ever get to the same level as ddr

[01:08] <timotimo> do it completely in horse stance or what it's called

[01:08] <MasterDuke> it really is mostly swinging your hands. some full body movement, but not a whole lot

[01:09] <timotimo> ah, ok

[01:11] <MasterDuke> well, off to go play something. maybe i'll be inspired tomorrow (or if anyone wants to write a detailed "type this here", "type that there" kind of instruction i'll follow that)

[01:11] <timotimo> have fun!

[10:55] <dogbert2_> lizmat, jnthn: you helped out last week with investigating and fixing a performance related regression in https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/7423640a8bc4d5b9dd7c960295154ee9

[10:57] <dogbert2_> Many thanks for that. There was however one thing which confused me. The current version does 29M scalar allocations while older versions does considerably less, i.e. 150k - 2M allocations depending on version

[10:59] <dogbert2_> I found the offending commit, were the number of Scalar allocs starts to increase massively. It's eb3917c260bce1cb56e2ee40abebd12c4dbcd9b2 (Rakudo).

[11:11] <jnthn> dogbert2_: Did you get HEAD MoarVM/NQP, which has profiling that doesn't block PEA opts?

[11:12] <jnthn> With that, I saw the number of allocations/GC runs drop off massively :)

[12:18] *** dogbert2_ left
[12:45] *** dogbert2_ joined
[13:04] <dogbert2_> jnthn: now the profiler output looks like this: 'The profiled code did 42 garbage collections. ... Scalar replacement eliminated 29171849 allocations (that's 89.39%).'

[13:13] <dogbert2_> which is impressive. Thing is that these 29M allocs were not present at all as late as https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6b44c5815aa4d6e3b2ffce628c39f7b1beaf4277

[13:15] <dogbert2_> the following commit, i.e. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/eb3917c260bce1cb56e2ee40abebd12c4dbcd9b2 jumps from 150k scalars to 54M scalars and 666 GC's, a few commits later it's down to 29M allocs and 376 GC's

[13:20] *** lucasb joined
[13:29] <jnthn> dogbert2_: Yeah, we relied on lazy vivification of lexicals avoiding those allocations before now. With the latest opts they are lowered to locals, where there's no laziness machinery, but PEA can determine they are unused and eliminate them.

[13:30] <jnthn> It may be that we can determine it's unused statically and kill it off altogether, though :)

[13:39] <dogbert2_> sounds interesting, so there are still plenty of possible optimizations

[22:17] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: I'm not convinced there's anything wrong Rakudo wise in 2635. I mean, it's not "the compiler"'s fault if the program it's running requests a ton of memory.
