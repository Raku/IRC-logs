[00:24] <Kaiepi> looks like i'll be able to really get started with my grant work once moarvm creates their release branch

[00:24] <Kaiepi> already made my first (well, third really) set of pullreqs for it a week ago but people were busy with blockers

[12:06] <|Tux|> Is JJMerelo also here?

[12:06] <timotimo> apparently not

[12:07] <|Tux|> what is is nick if he is?

[12:07] <jmerelo> hey

[12:07] <|Tux|> o/

[12:07] <|Tux|> I want to accept your PR. Are you able to have a look at the .travis file and why it fails?

[12:08] <|Tux|> merged

[12:08] <jmerelo> Ah, OK

[12:09] <jmerelo> |Tux|: the main problem is that Text::CSV is both in CPAN and the ecosystem. And zef returns one to some, another to other people.

[12:09] <timotimo> The shell hook required to use rakudobrew in 'env' mode and use the 'shell' command seems not to be installed.

[12:10] <jmerelo> |Tux|: so while sena_kun was having no trouble installing it (getting it from source), my zef got it from CPAN, which seems to be outdated... Hence the PR

[12:10] <jmerelo> timotimo: right. The travis conf needs to be updated with the latest upgrade to rakudobrew. It's no longer working.

[12:11] <jmerelo> |Tux|: I can change the .travis.yml to use my own docker container for testing. It's going to be inmediately faster.

[12:11] <|Tux|> do you want commit?

[12:12] <|Tux|> (under the condition that changes are done in  *my*  style

[12:13] <jmerelo> |Tux|: if it helps... I'm seeing that your Travis is kinda complicated, so it's maybe better to create a custom Dockerfile. 

[12:13] * |Tux| is no docker expert

[12:14] <|Tux|> what is your github id?

[12:14] <jmerelo> |Tux|: unless you just want to test, in which case I can just slap the standard Dockerfile. It's not going to test the JVM backend, for instance...

[12:14] <jmerelo> |Tux|: JJ

[12:15] <jmerelo> |Tux|: I'll open an issue and try and work on it...

[12:15] <|Tux|> I've added yoiu to the github collaborators

[12:16] <jmerelo> |Tux|: thanks!

[13:49] <ugexe> zef should not "returns one to some, another to other people.". i would suggest running with --debug and ensure you aren't getting one from your local cache 

[13:50] <ugexe> because zef should prefer cpan over identical version from p6c

[13:51] <ugexe> using a default config file

[13:51] <ugexe> otherwise there might be a rakudo regression in sorting

[19:03] <samcv> AlexDaniel, feeling better. and just did my final dutch test for this class this morning. so should be more free from tomorrow :)

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> sounds promising :)

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> would be awesome to release before the squashathon‚Ä¶ or at least during

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: status

[19:04] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in 1 day and ‚âà8 hours (2019-07-06 UTC-14‚åÅUTC+20). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[19:06] <timotimo> i kind of forgot about me not having put the new heap snapshot format into master yet

[19:06] <timotimo> welp, there's always a next release isn't there

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> probably

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> :)

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> you can put it into master no prob

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> :P

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> although, uh, moar‚Ä¶

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> ok maybe not

[19:07] <timotimo> yeah, no i shouldn't

[19:07] <timotimo> it's currently not working all that well

[19:10] <MasterDuke> looking forward to the release. fair warning, i'm going to merge a rebased https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/518 and https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2670 after the release

[19:18] <timotimo> yay

[20:21] <japhb> Yeah, looking forward to that

[20:22] <MasterDuke> so far the NQP PR has rebased and tested clean, but i'm having to make some new additions to the Rakudo PR

[21:44] <Kaiepi> should this throw a better error or should enums automatically pass native int/str/nums passed to it?

[21:44] <Kaiepi> s/pass/box/

[21:45] <Kaiepi> i'm guessing this happens because enums want an Int by default, not an int

[21:46] <Kaiepi> box it when the enum's type isn't actually that native type, i mean

[21:52] <MasterDuke> at absolute minimum the error is LTA, but i'm kind of surprised it didn't work, i wouldn't have expected that

[21:55] <Kaiepi> lta?

[21:59] <MasterDuke> "less than awesome"

[22:00] <Kaiepi> oh

[22:01] <Kaiepi> it gave a much harder to debug error when i tried passing an nqp::const to an enum when building rakudo when i updated my socket families pullreq a little while ago

[22:01] <Kaiepi> i wouldn't have known what it had to do with if just doing that wasn't the only thing i was doing at the time
