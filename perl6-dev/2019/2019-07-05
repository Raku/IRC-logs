[06:53] <lizmat> MasterDuke: do you have any rollback suggestions at this time ?

[06:54] <MasterDuke> ?

[06:54] <MasterDuke> if you rollback to right before the nqp bump it should be fine

[06:54] <Kaiepi> .tell timotimo can we talk about whether or not i need to rebootstrap nqp for my nativecall wide string support pullreq again? i ran into an issue that may require it

[06:54] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[06:56] <lizmat> git checkout d4ceb97e06cd01babdd34356140 and a reconfigure, does not even build  :-(

[06:59] <MasterDuke> lizmat: using --gen-nqp ?

[06:59] <lizmat> perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --make-install

[06:59] <lizmat> to be exact

[07:00] <lizmat> I actually nuked the nqp dir, but it didn't refetch not recompile it

[07:00] <lizmat> guess I need to nuke more

[07:00] <MasterDuke> the install directory probably

[07:01] <MasterDuke> is there a way to pass --ll-exception through all the calls zef makes?

[07:02] <MasterDuke> if not, definitely ++ to ugexe's suggestion of a LL_EXCEPTIONS env variable

[07:02] <lizmat> I think you can call zef as "perl6 --ll-exception .../zef ?

[07:02] <MasterDuke> yep, but it doesn't pass that through

[08:07] <patrickb> .tell ugexe Putting a space in the appveyor build path sounds good! But note that non-Windows currently does not work in a path with spaces (the dyncall build currently doesn't support that on Linux).

[08:07] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to ugexe.

[08:08] <patrickb> .tell ugexe On a related note. There are many different build setups that we support and don't want to break, but that do break time and time again. (Windows: cl/mingw/clang, 1/3 prefixes, non-reloc/reloc, Linux: gcc/clang, 1/3 prefixes, non-reloc/reloc)

[08:08] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to ugexe.

[08:08] <patrickb> .tell ugexe I do like to have a way to automatically test all of these when making changes to the build system. But I don't like inflating the CI. Do you know whether it's possible to have travis/appveyor/circleci jobs that don't run automatically, but can be triggered?

[08:08] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to ugexe.

[08:09] <patrickb> .tell ugexe Also, do you intend to get rid of Travis, now that we have CircleCI up and running?

[08:09] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to ugexe.

[08:15] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[09:04] <Kaiepi> so i'm starting my work on the changes to CStr's REPR needed for wide string support

[09:05] <Kaiepi> should i add a variable to storage specs containing the native type of whatever they contain or should it stay separate?

[09:05] <Kaiepi> since P6int and P6num already have native type variables in their state as well

[09:49] <MasterDuke> nine: ping

[10:09] <MasterDuke> lizmat: think it's fixed. just running a spectest to make sure it didn't cause any other regressions

[12:40] <MasterDuke> glad to hear it

[12:41] <masak> MasterDuke: it strikes me that the issue cf6fd926 fixes could have been detected statically. I feel strangely inclined to put together something that would check for that, maybe as early as tonight. what's your opinion?

[12:47] <MasterDuke> masak: that seems possible. i was just concerned with getting the bugs fixed (and getting something merged at all)

[12:47] <MasterDuke> i'd be very curious to see what you come up with

[12:49] <masak> hey, no criticism implied at all -- great work on fixing the direct problem! :+1:

[12:50] <masak> I'm thinking a quick-and-dirty approach might use Perl 5, regexes, and Text::Balanced

[12:50] <masak> a longer-term fix could maybe hook into the AST stage of the nqp compiler

[12:54] <MasterDuke> no worries, didn't think that was criticism

[21:28] <Kaiepi> i asked before, but what are storage specs used for with reprs? would it be a good idea to add a variable stating the type of what's being stored to it?

[21:29] <timotimo> storage spec is for a lower-level thing than types are

[21:29] <timotimo> a storage spec will, for example, allow P6opaque to inline a native int inside of its parent object

[21:30] <timotimo> so that a class with has int8 $.foo; int8 $.bar; int8 $.baz; int8 $.bloop; will actually only use 4 bytes for that piece of data

[21:30] <Kaiepi> ohh

[21:30] <Kaiepi> neat

[21:31] <timotimo> almost everything that "holds a type" will have a reference, though

[21:31] <Kaiepi> why do P6int and P6num copy members between their repr data and the storage spec though?

[21:32] <Kaiepi> on moar at least

[21:33] <timotimo> not sure what you are refering to; do you have a link?

[21:35] <Kaiepi> my dns is shitting itself, check mk_storage_spec and type_object_for in src/6model/reprs/P6int.c

[21:36] <Kaiepi> nvm http://fpaste.scsys.co.uk/585208

[21:37] <timotimo> i'm looking at it locally

[21:37] <timotimo> that's less "what does it store", that's more of "what am i"

[21:39] <Kaiepi> so it specifies what's getting inlined?

[21:41] <timotimo> every ST has a WHAT in it

[21:41] <timotimo> you can get from a type object to the STable and from the STable to its type object

[21:45] <Kaiepi> STABLE(typeobj), st->WHAT right?

[21:48] <Kaiepi> last question, does CStr need a storage spec in its REPR data when i'm storing a type, number of bits, and its sign in it?

[21:50] <timotimo> yep, though STABLE goes with every object

[21:51] <timotimo> storage spec is for the other types to use, whereas the repr data is for the type itself to use

[21:51] <timotimo> the storage spec is basically a unified API that is the same across all 6model objects

[21:51] <timotimo> whereas the REPR_data can be freely defined by the type using it

[21:57] <Kaiepi> so it sounds like no since afaik strings can't be inlined in REPRs like CStruct/CPPStruct/CUnion

[21:58] <timotimo> we do have support for CArray inlined in CStruct/CPPStruct at least

[21:58] <timotimo> but strings have even less theoretical support for a specified length

[22:03] <Kaiepi> making that possible sounds out of the scope of what i'm doing
