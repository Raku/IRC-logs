[12:11] <AlexDaniel> hm, why was it decided to keep NQP meaning something

[12:11] <AlexDaniel> that just makes any changes so much harder

[12:11] * AlexDaniel looks

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: “It feels that this could stay” please read the nqp readme

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it suggests that it's Not Quite Perl 6 more than once

[12:14] <AlexDaniel> from what I remember, I said that I'd prefer NQP to mean nothing, so NQP is just NQP

[12:14] <lizmat> that's my recollection as well

[12:14] *** Guest13443 joined
[12:14] <lizmat> so we don't need another acronym, 

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> “The acronym for NQP is Not Quite Perl”

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> from the PR

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> and it even goes to say “It stays that way, so no changes to documentation are needed”

[12:18] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: see this ↑

[12:18] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: sorry, I'm in the middle of what is going to be a ginormous Perl 6 Weekly, which is also quite emotional for me

[12:19] <lizmat> could I think about that tomorrow?

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: that's alright, we now have all the time in the orld :)

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> w

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: just a question though, will rba take care of the domain?

[12:20] <lizmat> which domain?

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: currently linking to raku.org is a bit problematic because it doesn't redirect correctly

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> for example https://raku.org/community/ leads to the wrong place

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> so instead of fixing that, can we just go straight to raku.org doing the right thing, and perl6.org redirecting?

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> this is what rba should be able to do, from what I understand

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> or at least they should know who to ping to get it done

[12:21] <lizmat> atm raku.org/foobar  goes to perl6.org

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> yep, but should go to perl6.org/foobar

[12:23] <MasterDuke> didn't pmichaud express a strong desire for NQP to stay "not quite perl(6?)"

[12:24] <AlexDaniel> ah, maybe that was the reason, yeah

[12:25] <rba> Let me know if I can do something. I‘m not sure what would be the best to redirect vs. host on both names.

[12:25] <AlexDaniel> maybe pmichaud can then tweak the README as they see fit

[12:26] <AlexDaniel> because right now it doesn't make much sense after my changes, and honestly it made even less sense before my changes

[12:26] *** anatofuz left
[12:26] <AlexDaniel> (considering the rename, of course)

[12:27] <AlexDaniel> rba: wasn't there a SEO issue with hosting on both names?

[12:27] <jnthn> On NQP, I can also take a look, though not until later today (or mebbe tomorrow)

[12:27] <MasterDuke> without really having a stake in the game or knowing how difficult the various options are, i would vote for whatever (redirect, host on both) has the least impact on anybody going to either (at least for the short term)

[12:27] <AlexDaniel> rba: so what google for example sees is that someone (on raku.org) is simply copying the contents of a well-known website (perl6.org)

[12:28] <AlexDaniel> rba: and so they'd penalize raku.org, or at least that's my understanding

[12:28] <rba> AlexDaniel: Yes, that‘s what jjmerelo said.

[12:28] <MasterDuke> i.e., copying all content to both would be preferable to someone going to either and it not working

[12:28] <MasterDuke> and i would vote for taking a short-term seo hit to make sure that content is available

[12:28] *** anatofuz joined
[12:29] <rba> The question for perl6.org would be anyway if we like to freeze the site as it is, make a clone of the repo and start changing there hosted as raku.org

[12:29] <MasterDuke> i wouldn't want the news to get out and people try to visit a website (either, i don't care) and get 404s

[12:31] <lizmat> I'd like to think about site issues tomorrow

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> I personally see no problem just redirecting to raku.org

[12:31] <lizmat> Also, I'd rather we work on a new raku.org site rather than just cat-licensing the current one

[12:31] <lizmat> and when that new site is ready, *then* swap and make perl6.org a redirect to raku.org

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> who's going to work on new site

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> and how long that'd take?

[12:33] <lizmat> as long as it needs

[13:27] <tellable6> 2019-10-11T23:21:18Z #perl6-dev <Kaiepi> patrickb, i don't think it does. you'd have to loop over the list of groups getgroups returns or st instead

[13:29] *** Geth left
[13:29] <patrickb> Just a quick question wrt the plan of execution for the rename. Do we try to do a centralized rename on one set date or do we just start renaming stuff?

[13:30] <patrickb> If we try to do the former, then I'd like the websites to not change or redirect to raku.org or something before we are ready in general.

[13:30] <tyil> Geth has just been updated to use #raku and #raku-dev

[13:40] <nine> Looking through the release blockers, we actually seem to be in a pretty good shape. They're all in the "please re-test" stage or similar, except for the hand full of blin regressions - which are not all certain regressions

[14:22] <AlexDaniel> I don't remember what's up with Math::FFT::Libfftw3

[14:22] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, it's looking pretty good

[14:24] <patrickb> If we want to make this release the first that provides pre compiled distributions, we still need to change the website to have respective download buttons.

[14:24] <patrickb> That's not a blocker though

[14:31] <nine> pre compiled distributions?

[14:34] <patrickb> nine: Binary releases. A compiled MoarVM + Rakudo + zef + some documentation. See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release-guide-binary.md

[14:34] <patrickb> In .zip for Windows and .tgz for MacOS + Linux.

[14:38] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: isn't it something that rakudo star should do?

[14:38] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure

[14:38] <AlexDaniel> and even if we do it, it does feel like these should be separate from main source tarballs, right?

[14:39] <patrickb> They should be a separate tarballs for sure.

[14:39] *** anatofuz left
[14:40] <patrickb> I don't see a strong reason why we shouldn't do them for every compiler release, except for the additional work.

[15:07] <Guest13443> patrickb: can I ask you a question about perl6-valgrind-m and perl6-gdb-m ?

[15:07] <patrickb> Go ahead

[15:09] <Guest13443> If I run those command from my rakudo dir they don't work since --libpath=/home/dogbert/repos/rakudo/install/share/nqp/lib is missing

[15:09] <Guest13443> it is not missing from perl6-m however

[15:10] <Guest13443> it used to work not too long ago

[15:13] <patrickb> Sounds wrong.

[15:16] <Guest13443> I get the feeling that the above libpath gets lost somehow

[15:19] <patrickb> I'm not sure they are even intended to work from the build dir anymore. I thought they would only be generated on install, but I might be mistaken.

[15:21] <patrickb> I'll be back in a few minutes...

[15:21] *** patrickb left
[15:29] *** patrickb joined
[15:33] <Guest13443> perhaps people are not supposed to run this stuff from the build dir but if that's the case then why does perl6-m work?

[15:35] <nine> Why would I only get valgrind or gdb support with an installed rakudo?

[17:24] <lucasb> The question of whether the rename was a backward compatible change was raised in #81. I *do* believe it is one of the most backward incompatible change this project could ever made, since eventually every user will have to touch their code if they want it to keep working on newer Raku versions. And YET, everything else is *frozen*.

[17:24] <lucasb> There's lot of little details that such rename will need (file extensions, version number, maybe others) that were made in a rush. And there are other little details that have already accumulated in Perl 6 itself... So, may I re-raise my suggestion: *lift the backward compatibility burden completely* and say this project will be delivering a "v1.0" in about a year or so? 

[17:24] *** leont joined
[17:27] <lucasb> IOW, turn this moment in "before christmas" again :)

[17:31] <vrurg> lucasb: do you consider the limited resources we actually have?

[17:31] * vrurg knows what it would take to change the version numbering.

[17:47] <lucasb> vrurg: My suggestion is to relax the backward compatibility constraint, now that the rename path was chosen. I wrote "v1.0" in quotes because I don't care what the new versioning scheme would look like. IMO, Raku v6 don't make sense, but I'm fine with it. And "v1.0" of this project was already released in 2015 by the same limited resources this project has. This new again first version would be about polishing it. If 

[17:47] <lucasb> there's nothing outstanding to change, then fine, Raku is perfect, and let current decisions crystalize themselves.

[17:54] <vrurg> lucasb: The renaming PR was written based on the assumption that no other breakage except for unavoidable is to take place. Then, again, in 2015 there was nothing to break about the versioning. And, actually, it wasn't v1.0 anyway. The way I currently see it is that we gonna have another debate on versioning and if it ever going to change then I'd be rather in favor of moving on to v7.0. All the historical reasons, amount of changes, backward compat – 

[17:54] <vrurg> everything would be in favor of this.
