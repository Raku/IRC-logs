[15:21] <scovit> nine: I've been thinking about your comment on https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1042 , I was reasoning that NativeCall v2 would be best thought about a much tighter integration with 6model and the jit instead of about a new syntax

[15:24] <scovit> eventually the most commont syntax should be something like parsing a C header file at compile-tyme, while the most dynamic aspect would not need any syntax magic and could expose an object oriented interface

[15:24] <scovit> what would you think about that?

[15:28] <scovit> (of course I would also keep the present syntax for compatibility)

[22:12] <scovit> nine: it might be me that I don't know enough to understand, but I fail to see the need for the parameter to hash to MVMint16 *arg_types dancing logic

[22:12] *** MasterDuke joined
[22:12] *** MasterDuke left
[22:12] *** MasterDuke joined
[22:13] <scovit> in struct MVMNativeCallBody, there might be more object arrays than MVMint16's

[22:14] <scovit> the C side could take care of using the huge amount of metadata that is stored in STables

[22:15] <scovit> JIT integration is there and incomplete as you point out, but considering all the possible architectures out there it seems unlikely that it will be ever be complete

[22:18] <scovit> but there is a quite simple mapping between 6model and libffi data structures

[22:21] <scovit> but the JIT fast path could be taken before the setup of the current dyncall/libffi, if MVMNativeCallBody was more 6model centric

[22:22] *** lucasb left
[22:24] <scovit> of course, only for the arches and calling convention that the jit implements
