[02:20] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: see tickets linked from that issue, a lot of them are probably fixable now

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> vrurg++

[02:22] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: Not today. But two I've checked are both seemingly need fixes to be implemented.

[02:23] <vrurg> Which is I'm definietely not up to with problem-solving#47, problem-solving#3 and a pack of own tickets still opened. ;)

[02:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I love your work :)

[02:26] <vrurg> You're making me blush... ;)

[02:27] <vrurg> BTW, would be interesting to see if nothing in ecosystem is suffering from the fix.

[02:28] <vrurg> Though spectests are passing I'm sure that 6.c/6.d are not fully backward compatible.

[06:53] <gfldex> I got a method inside a grammar that returns a Match object. This Match object also got a .list already filled with further Match objects. The grammar engine is overwriting that list with the empty list. Is this intentional?

[22:29] <vrurg> jnthn: Though EVAL is currently using it's outer's CORE, what do you think about EVAL q{...}, :unit which would simulate complete unit compilation?

[22:33] <jnthn> vrurg: I'd be fine with such an option; it's quite useful

[22:33] <jnthn> And would allow use of `use v6.c` sanely too

[22:33] <jnthn> (Which I guess is why you're asking about it :))

[22:34] <vrurg> jnthn: Ok. I think I know why EVAL isn't thread-safe – it shares same compiler where in fact it must create a new isntance. Perhaps this would allow for correct :unit option too.

[22:34] <vrurg> No, not really. is-run work for me now. ;)

[22:35] <vrurg> *works

[22:36] <MasterDuke> jnthn: while you're here, any thoughts on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3057 ?

[22:38] *** MasterDuke left
[22:48] <jnthn> .tell MasterDuke It looks like a handle isn't being closed somewhere at process termination; I don't know where without spending some time debugging it, but there's a decent chance it should be happening in MoarVM somewhere

[22:48] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> that code is weird

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> if you try to do anything like that without bind-stdin, normally you'd get “===SORRY!=== To avoid data races, you must tap stdout before running the process”

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> so is the code safe or are we simply missing the error message?

[22:51] <AlexDaniel> ah wait, I looked at the code again, it's correct

[22:51] <AlexDaniel> nevermind
