[07:45] <nine> Seems like camelia fell victim to the build system overhaul as well: https://gist.github.com/niner/1f39324dfc4584dacca1c2cce15d236f

[07:47] <nine> No idea how to fix that

[07:48] <timotimo> nine: "git submodule update" in nqp and rakudo?

[07:57] <nine> How is a user supposed to know that??

[07:58] <nine> Anyway, it does get further now, but I think the underlying issue is still the same: https://gist.github.com/niner/ff149ef81ee18601e34adc26eb500230

[08:01] <timotimo> agreed, it got a little messy

[08:05] <timotimo> we probably should send/should have sent out a p6lert

[08:05] <timotimo> but fresh clones of rakudo should be fine immediately

[08:06] <timotimo> and bleeding edge isn't recommended for users for reasons like this and many more anyway i guess?

[08:06] * timotimo afk for ~a quarter day

[08:07] <nine> Once it's released it's no longer bleeding edge but will still suffer from the same issues.

[08:07] <nine> It's not about bleeding edge. It's that upgrading rakudo via git pull is just broken.

[08:09] <nine> And in this case, it looks like a bug in Configure.pl as it's looking for a "unix/nqp-m-" which should be followed by "reloc" or "nonreloc" but isn;t

[08:27] <lizmat> that should work, shouldn't it ?

[08:27] <lizmat> looks like we have no spectests for ⚛️ whatsoever :-(

[08:29] <nine> lizmat: it's ⚛ not ⚛️

[08:30] <nine> though they look exactly the same in my terminal. Copied the correct one from https://doc.perl6.org/type/atomicint

[08:30] <lizmat> indeed

[08:31] <lizmat> nine++

[08:32] <lizmat> and we do have spectests if you look for the right thing  *phew*

[08:35] <nine> I only found it because I just couldn't believe that jnthn++ would write such a thing without a single test :)

[08:40] <lizmat> hmmm... looks like we lost Geth again  :-(

[17:47] <timotimo> i'm too dumb to understand where in the compiler or backend the right place would be to install a confprog

[17:47] <timotimo> who wants to help me

[18:03] <timotimo> interesting, nqp's setting doesn't really offer any binary file operations
