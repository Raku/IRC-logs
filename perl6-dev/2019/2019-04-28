[08:59] <nine> Ha! Remaining reproducibility issue does seem to be the optimizer's fault. And connected to conditionals.

[15:55] <patrickb> releasable6: status

[15:55] <releasable6> patrickb, Next release will happen when it's ready. 2 blockers. 61 out of 252 commits logged (⚠ 51 warnings)

[15:57] <patrickb> I'm just going through the unlogged commits. It seems releasable6 doesn't see changelog entries of which the length of the sha doesn't match.

[15:59] <patrickb> I always put 9 digits in the changelog, the unlogged commits list lists 8 digits. There are some changelog entries with only 7 digits and those seem to be seen...

[15:59] <patrickb> Is there an at-most-8-digits limit?

[16:01] <AlexDaniel`> patrickb: see warnings

[16:01] <AlexDaniel`> it explicitly demands 8 characters

[16:02] <patrickb> OK. I trimmed them.

[16:03] <AlexDaniel`> these 4 should be fixed too :)

[16:03] <AlexDaniel`> a bit harder than trimming, but luckily there are only 4 of them

[17:11] <nine> .tell [Tux] so maybe they put the fence down on purpose _because_ they were afraid the wind would throw it around?

[17:11] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to [Tux].

[19:06] <bartolin_> since Geth isn't here: I've just committed https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/f0017e9eae (fix for CONTROL not catching labeled exception in nqp::handle on the JVM backend)
