[10:41] <jnthn> aww, was hoping that'd narrow it down without me having to read carefully :)

[10:44] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: hah it's interesting that bisectable accepted 2018.06..HEAD syntax

[10:44] *** greppable6 joined
[10:45] <jnthn> I was just wildly guessing :)

[10:45] *** shareable6 joined
[10:45] <AlexDaniel> it does work with a comma ( 2018.06,HEAD ), but .. is something I've never seen before :)

[10:46] *** evalable6 joined

[10:46] *** squashable6 joined

[10:47] <AlexDaniel> sure, and it accepted it because this works:

[10:47] <AlexDaniel> c: HEAD~10..HEAD say 42

[10:47] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¬¶HEAD~10..HEAD (12 commits): ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[10:47] <jnthn> aha :)

[10:47] <AlexDaniel> but internally it expands it to a list of all these commits, while bisectable expects just two

[18:31] <MasterDuke> man. i think my changes are good, but a spectest breaks. i sort of suspect both my changes and the spectest are correct, but the implementation might be slightly buggy and only passed before by accident

[18:32] <MasterDuke> it's a P5regex spectest, so maybe i should just +1 the vote to remove them and then i don't need to worry about it...
