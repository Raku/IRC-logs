[06:36] <jmerelo> You've seen this? https://github.com/features/package-registry?utm_campaign=1557516528&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=1557516528 Could we try and prepare a PR for Perl 6?

[06:37] <jmerelo> Although I'm not sure they will open it to other package registries... For the time being there are only 5.

[06:48] <jmerelo> Will be interesting to get into the beta and keep an eye on it.

[15:04] <dogbert17> lizmat: what happens if you run 'perl6 --ll-exception -e 'my @a = (^10000)>>.Str' on your Mac?

[15:06] <dogbert17> lizmat: sorry I meant 'perl6 --profile -e 'my @a = (^10000)>>.Str'

[15:06] <lizmat> dogbert17: creates a profile fine

[15:06] <lizmat> should I look at the profile?

[15:09] <dogbert17> lizmat: I guess you should. My goal is to add a comment to RT#131813

[15:09] <synopsebot> RT#131813 [open]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131813 Segfault with --profile

[15:10] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel wanted someone with a Mac to test it before adding a testneeded label

[15:14] <dogbert17> Huh, it has a testneeded label, am I going insane?

[15:34] <dogbert17> does anyone know if the following line is unnecessary? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/ebb0521bd259e9f81e4b127527534090969f398e/src/core/native_array.pm#L1399

[16:10] <bartolin> dogbert17: if I don't misunderstand git, that variable was removed lizmat++ in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d6a9edacf2

[16:17] <dogbert17> bartolin: I seem to be behind the times :) thanks for clearing that up
