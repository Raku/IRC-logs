[12:25] <pmurias> vrurg: the truffle branch isn't a gradual performance improvemnt, it's a rebuild using a completely different technology

[12:26] <pmurias> vrurg: truffle generates a custom JIT from a interpreter using partical evaluation dark magic rather then relying on generating JVM bytecode

[12:51] *** pmurias joined
[13:28] <vrurg> pmurias: does it provide other advantages besides of speed up?

[13:33] *** lucasb joined
[13:42] <pmurias> vrurg: super fast interop with other languages that have a truffle implementation

[13:43] <pmurias> (we don't have that yet, as the truffle backend was in early stages)

[13:47] <pmurias> vrurg: they had plans to add language-protocol-server integration to truffle but I'm not sure what's the state of that

[13:48] <vrurg> Interesting!

[13:49] <vrurg> However much I don't like Java. ;)

[13:50] <pmurias> vrurg: for the truffle backend a lot of the usual Java boilerplate was solved by generating code from annotations for a lot of the repetive stuff

[13:50] <pmurias> but it's still written in Java :/

[13:53] <vrurg> Whatever. I don't like it for two reasons: it was hellishly slow back then which is not really a case anymore. And they dictate me how to program, but I'm lucky to choose the language and can avoid it. Otherwise I don't care. 

[13:53] <vrurg> But the idea is interesting, no doubt.

[13:56] <vrurg> pmurias: BTW, more actual thing. I've started reworking NQP makefiles with the same purpose as for Rakudo. I would try to manage JS without you. But still might ask for your help.

[13:57] <pmurias> vrurg: I'll try to help, but getting nqp.js to work should be a lot easier now that rakudo.js works

[13:59] <vrurg> I hope for this too. Though I already see it's not doing a few things moar and jvm do â€“ like it doesn't have OPS and ASTNodes parts. I would require conditionals in templates which I try to avoid as much as possible.

[14:00] <vrurg> By ASTNodes I mean MAST and JAST.

[14:01] <pmurias> vrurg: you want to reorganize the js code to have it the same way?

[14:02] <pmurias> vrurg: also a fundamental difference is that the js backend bootstraps using the moar one instead of having a stage0 in js

[14:04] <vrurg> Reorganazing wasn't my intention. Let's see how it goes. I'll have moar and jvm done. Then it'll be more clear what is needed.

[14:04] <vrurg> So, for now â€“ just ignore it. :)

[14:05] <vrurg> I don't think I'd have something working before the next week.

[18:49] <Geth_> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/565b2ac219

[18:49] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yes if you write a script to do that :D

[18:49] <vrurg> "Damn you, Addams!" (c) ;p

[18:49] <AlexDaniel> don't forget to handle unbuildable commits correctly!

[18:49] <AlexDaniel> and make sure your exit codes are right :)

[18:50] <AlexDaniel> tobs: â†‘ speaking of which, there are two really needed things we should implement eventually

[18:50] <vrurg> Ok, will get back to it later. Won't have time until finish with nqp makefiles anyway.

[18:50] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: honestly, it's more reliable to do it manually. There should be just 11 steps or so

[18:50] <AlexDaniel> that's about an hour of your attention

[18:51] <AlexDaniel> tobs: one is a local use of the bots, preferably without running an irc server. So that you can `bisect: say 42` from a command line and it works

[18:52] <AlexDaniel> tobs: another is building rakudo on demand. Currently it attempts to get an archive from the main server, and if that fails it just skips it. Instead, if there's nothing on the main server, it should build it on the current machine

[18:53] <vrurg> Perhaps. The problem is that makefiles require me to be very scrupulous and I can't parallelize. NP, it can wait, I think. Or somebody would locate the problem in the meanwhile.

[18:53] <vrurg> Thanks!
