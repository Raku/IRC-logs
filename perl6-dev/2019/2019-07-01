[01:11] <AlexDaniel> elems requires a concrete object (got a VMNull type object instead)

[01:11] <AlexDaniel> :|

[01:12] <AlexDaniel> “fixed” by working around but that's probably not cool

[01:12] <AlexDaniel> something about `temp` though, so not common

[13:13] <timotimo> lizmat: "found a signature error pseudostash.which", does that miss an "in" or something?

[19:14] <timotimo> oh?

[19:14] <timotimo> fetching from cpan failed or something?

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - pretty JSON had lost its space after the colon, now it has one again

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - unpretty JSON still had a space, now gone

[19:17] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - unpretty JSON should just have a ",", not a ",\n"

[19:17] <timotimo> lizmat++

[19:18] <timotimo> haha, the debug output

[19:18] <timotimo> fun fun

[19:18] <timotimo> well, i can use zef install just fine :(

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: that should go into the release, right?

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> or not?

[19:24] <lizmat> it's cosmetic, not a functional difference

[19:24] <timotimo> unless you expect to-json :!pretty to give exactly one line

[19:25] <lizmat> well... ok, but then you're not expecting JSON, but a subset of JSON: the ones on a single line

[19:25] <timotimo> fair enough

[19:25] <lizmat> for "from-json" there is no difference

[19:26] <timotimo> m: enum Blorb <Fleep>; Rakudo::Internals::to-json(Fleep).say

[19:27] <timotimo> *shruuuuuug*

[19:27] <timotimo> that's clearly not how you do it

[19:27] <timotimo> m: enum Blorb <Fleep>; to-json([Blorb, Fleep]).say

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar a26e95bab: OUTPUT: «[␤  null,␤  Fleep␤]␤Saw 1 occurrence of deprecated code.␤================================================================================␤Sub to-json (from GLOBAL) seen at:␤  <tmp>, line 1␤Please use JSON::Fast, JSON::Tiny or JSON::Pre…»

[19:27] <timotimo> ^- you can get invalid json with rakudo's internal to-json by using enums

[19:31] <vrurg> timotimo: could be because of [email@hidden.address] in repo url. Perhaps https:// is bettter be used instead.

[19:31] <timotimo> i thought i uploaded it to cpan actualy

[19:31] <timotimo> but maybe not

[19:32] <vrurg> Same I get for MoarVM::Remote and Data::MessagePack

[19:32] <vrurg> What makes it strange is that I can clone it manually.

[19:33] <vrurg> Perhaps zef ignores my github token.

[19:33] <timotimo> i can change the repo urls and see if that improves things

[19:34] <timotimo> but i thought with https you always get a username/password prompt

[19:35] <vrurg> That's true for git@github. https:// is generally R/O access.

[19:36] <timotimo> oh, huh?

[19:37] <vrurg> To be more precise: https is asking for credencials if you push. Pull just works.

[19:38] <vrurg> https://help.github.com/en/articles/why-is-git-always-asking-for-my-password – now this is strange.

[19:40] <timotimo> i've pushed both Moar-related libraries

[19:41] <vrurg> I'll try later, when indexes/caches are updated. Anyway, I think I've got the core.setting problem solved. Need to fix building of CORE:: namespace and that should be it.

[19:43] <vrurg> But not having papers on the internals is really painful. I mostly guessing how things are working. Still not sure if got the logic behind 'forceouterctx' right.
