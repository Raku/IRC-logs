[11:42] <lizmat> are you using .perl ?

[11:42] <lizmat> in the further future, the name of the executable that you're calling

[11:43] <lizmat> other than that, I don't think anything is being planned on being changed

[16:48] <lizmat> and the last Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2019/10/15/2019-41-new-wineskins/

[16:51] <sjn> yay!

[16:59] <rba> What was on https://fail.rakudo.party/ ?

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> rba: perl6 tickets, same as on https://rt.perl.org/

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> rba: it was just a different interface

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> rba: it was a single page app, pretty much, so if you're worried about broken links to it you can maybe redirect it somewhere

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> in the future it could lead to https://github.com/perl6/old-issue-tracker

[21:24] <timotimo> we may want to think about FALLBACK contributing via roles, not just TWEAK and BUILD

[21:41] *** squashable6 left
[21:43] *** squashable6 joined
[21:43] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v squashable6

[21:50] <patrickb> Currently the perl6 executable that is run from within the build dir creates a folder structure `../share/perl6/[core,site,vendor]/short`relative to the build directory. This is obviously unwanted.

[21:51] <patrickb> I'm pretty sure `src/core.c/CompUnit/RepositoryRegistry setup-repositories()` is to blame.

[21:54] <patrickb> I'm not sure what a good fix might be though.  We could either detect when perl6 is run from the build dir and special case on that, that sounds unclean to me. Or we hit at perl6 that the repository is located in a folder where it does little harm (e.g. the gen/ folder).

[21:54] <patrickb> Any opinions?

[21:54] <patrickb> s/hit/hint/

[21:56] <patrickb> I think this bug has been there for a long time, but has previously created that folder structure in the installation path.

[21:57] <vrurg> timotimo: if FALLBACK is a method it'd be copied down to consuming class anyway.

[21:57] <vrurg> patrickb: how do you want to hint it?

[21:59] <patrickb> It's basically using PERL6_HOME to create the folder structure. A environment variable (could be passed in the perl6-m.c build runner) is enough to point it at a different folder.

[22:00] <patrickb> The reason it puts it in ../share/perl6/ is because it tries to determine PERL6_HOME relative to the executable path. But that is wrong when the executable is not located in an installation.

[22:02] <vrurg> patrickb: perhaps, binaries must be created in a subdir? But I foresee some strong opposition to this.

[22:03] <vrurg> Though the right thing would be to make blib the build destination for everything. Binaries would the go into blib/bin

[22:03] <patrickb> As long as we don't replicate an installation folder structure inside the build dir we do have to put hacks in to make it work.

[22:04] <vrurg> So, we probably must replicate it.

[22:05] <patrickb> This is gonna get lots of opposition.

[22:06] <vrurg> timotimo: I think if we make submethod FALLBACK work in roles there must be a set of strict rules on how mutlple fallbacks are handled. Basically, it would have to be another multidispatch.

[22:07] <timotimo> yeah

[22:07] <vrurg> patrickb: Yes, no doubt. 

[22:07] <patrickb> Going all the way would mean not only putting the perl6 executable somewhere else, but all the native and p6 libraries just as well.

[22:08] <vrurg> timotimo: so, basically, it could be a special case where we implicitly create a proto and proclaim that FALLBACK must always be multi. Then we can just collect them from class roles and send into the proto as candidates.

[22:09] <vrurg> patrickb: I think it needs a well made plan and a problem-solving ticket.

[22:10] <patrickb> Do you think it makes sense to add a quick patch that makes it generate the dummy folders in build-dir/gen/ ?

[22:10] <timotimo> a wall-made plan would potentially also do

[22:10] <patrickb> Until we arrive at a larger solution?

[22:11] <vrurg> patrickb: If there are no urgent complants, I'd leave it as-is for a while. Because there is nothing more permanent than a temporary...

[22:12] <patrickb> Oh! You have that saying in the US as well?

[22:12] <vrurg> patrickb: We have this saying in eastern slavic langs. ;) But it's likely coming from Roman times, I guess.

[22:13] <patrickb> Well, it's placing folders in a random directory of the user. I suspect most people have just wondered where the folders came from, but didn't make the connection.

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> timotimo, patrickb, vrurg: any change we can have these great conversations on #raku-dev? :)

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> chance*

[22:16] <vrurg> Oops. I thought we're there. :D

[22:19] <vrurg> timotimo: would join us on #raku-dev? I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. 

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> also please configure your irc clients to autojoin #raku and #raku-dev and also perhaps remove #perl6 and #perl6-dev from the list :)

[22:23] *** Kaiepi left
[22:24] <vrurg> I don't see a reason of not autojoining #perl6* until we declare it deprecated and setup a bot to redirect people to the right place in one or another way.

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: it's deprecated, leave :P

[22:27] <vrurg> Where is the bot kicking my ass into the right direction? Hedgehog is a lazy bird, not fliying without a kick! :D
