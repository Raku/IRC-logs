[14:57] <jdv79> i noticed compilation may have gotten faster in the last 2 weeks or so (was on vaca).  did anything big happen?

[14:58] <jdv79> maybe ~15%

[15:03] *** llfourn joined
[15:08] *** llfourn left
[15:14] <jnthn> Hm, that's quite a lot.

[15:15] <jnthn> I'm not sure about in the last 2 weeks, but at least fairly recently I let NQP and Rakudo have different inline limits, since the Rakudo one led to some less than awesome decisions for NQP code.

[15:15] <jnthn> And did see some `make spectest` time decrease from that

[15:15] <jnthn> So it's possibly related

[15:16] <jdv79> nice

[16:51] <AlexDaniel> fyi I'll be away till May 20th, and then some more after that. Unfortunately my involvement for at least two months will be very limited for reasons out of my control

[21:02] <nine> Just pushed https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/532d19fc4e18bc08f7660d430d1c696bcbbe4b9d Test reproducibility of precompilation

[21:02] <nine> This hopefully ensures that I'll again never have to spend a weekend hunting these down :)

[21:03] <MasterDuke> nine++

[21:07] <timotimo> cool

[21:15] <jnthn> nine++

[21:20] <MasterDuke> jnthn: have you seen my question on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2827 ?

[21:21] <jnthn> MasterDuke: ah, no, I missed that

[21:22] <jnthn> Hmm, I wonder if that issue is connected to the recursion issue or not

[21:23] <jnthn> No immediate guesses, though

[21:24] <MasterDuke> huh

[21:24] <jnthn> I don't get why it's got an NQPArray there rather than dumping it...

[21:25] <jnthn> I'd think if it was because it saw it earlier it's also say <self-reference>

[21:27] <jnthn> I'm still not sure where the self-reference comes from, mind

[21:30] <jnthn> Oh, I note earlier in the ticket it still had that problem dumping the statements even before my recursion fix, when the self-reference was added

[21:30] <jnthn> You posted that, even :)

[21:30] <jnthn> Which makes it look like that is a separate issue, which was my gut feeling looking at it too.

[21:30] <jnthn> So maybe that bit broke previously

[21:34] <jnthn> afk for a bit

[21:41] <MasterDuke> jnthn: sorry, what is a separate issue? that `rule lang-version` recurses?

[21:43] <MasterDuke> which i don't understand why it does, it looks like the only thing in it are <version> and <vnum>, neither of which call <lang-version>
