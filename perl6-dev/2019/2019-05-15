[15:00] <patrickb> vrurg: So a simple reconfigure fixes those problems? If yes I'm not sure a fix apart from perhaps a notification during make is necessary.

[15:02] <patrickb> vrurg: If it's actually that simple, can you ping nine and lizmat to give it a try?

[15:11] <lizmat> I found that nuking all precomp dirs involved, seems to solve the issue

[15:22] *** patrickb left
[15:31] <vrurg> Nuking precomps isn't the way, I think. It seems that changing any of CORE files lead to the problem. Then, yes – make clean to do correct rebuild, and removal of precomps to allow the code to run.

[16:17] <ugexe> consider multiple perl6 installs (which would share ~/.perl6), or upgrading an existing perl6. i imagine one of these would not be happy with nuking precomps

[16:18] <jnthn> I'm not sure anyone is proposing that as an actual solution, just observing it helps, which is probably a clue to what's going wrong.

[19:54] <Kaiepi> i can't figure out what i need to do to get Rakudo::Internals.EVALUATE-FEED to work

[19:54] <Kaiepi> i have the pipeline set up and everything but the stages are still QAST nodes so it doesn't work when i try to run it

[19:55] <Kaiepi> do i need to use nqp::getcomp('QAST').as_mast/as_jast/etc. or something?

[19:57] <lizmat> Kaiepi: do you have a gist ?

[19:59] <Kaiepi> lizmat, https://gist.github.com/Kaiepi/72035a9216aef0926dcc91bd01e47020

[20:00] <lizmat> Kaiepi: I think you're misunderstood

[20:00] <lizmat> the nqp bits that used to live in Action, should stay there

[20:00] <Kaiepi> oh

[20:00] <lizmat> they should just set up an array, which then gets passed to EVALUATE-FEED

[20:01] <Kaiepi> an array of what?

[20:01] <lizmat> inside R:I you should only need to know that the @stages is an array of Callables

[20:02] <lizmat> and the result of the call to R:I.EVALUATE-FEED should be fed to a .STORE method on the pointy end

[20:03] <lizmat> hope that makes sense...

[20:04] <Kaiepi> what about cases where .STORE would need to be called in one of the stages like `my @ <== map { $_ ** 2 } <== my @ <== map { .succ } <== 1..10`?

[20:07] <lizmat> if it is a chunk that just receives, you codegen the .STORE on that, and use the result as the source for the next feed sequence

[20:07] <lizmat> so in the above example, you would have 2 calls to R:I::EVALUATE-FEED, in my opinion

[20:07] <Kaiepi> ohh ok

[20:07] <Kaiepi> i think i get what you mean now

[20:08] <vrurg> lizmat: Can you guess what's causing 'Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/BOOTSTRAP.nqp'? I trying to locate the problem, but narrowing down the search area would be appreciated.

[20:08] <lizmat> .STORE returns the result of the STORE:

[20:08] <lizmat> m: my %h; dd %h.STORE((a => 42))

[20:08] <lizmat> vrurg: I've seen several incarnations of that bug

[20:09] <lizmat> after reverting b9f899541b3f153ea73 I did a make clean, and nuked all of the precomp dirs I could find

[20:09] <lizmat> ah, and did a reconfigure

[20:09] <vrurg> It happens if one of the CORE.setting sources gets changes and then 'make install' fails.

[20:09] <lizmat> then it went away fro me

[20:10] <vrurg> lizmat: you don't need to reconfigure, just make clean works.

[20:12] <vrurg> Unfortuantely, removing precomps works for 'make install' but we can't ask everybody to nuke their precomps on every test run.
