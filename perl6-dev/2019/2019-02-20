[21:10] <patrickb> Hi everyone!

[21:10] <patrickb> What's the canonical way to run roast?

[21:24] <MasterDuke> patrickb: in the rakudo directory, `make m-spectest`

[21:27] *** sortiz joined
[21:27] <patrickb> MasterDuke: Thanks! Running now...

[21:28] <sortiz> \o perl6-dev

[21:32] <sortiz> Two questions: First a simple (stupid?) one: How can a get, in a program, the current Moar's version?

[21:34] <MasterDuke> m: say $*VM.version

[21:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar d6563816e: OUTPUT: «v2018.12.110.g.04982.f.6.e.9␤»

[21:36] <sortiz> Thanks MasterDuke

[21:36] <MasterDuke> np

[21:38] *** nebuchadnezzar left
[21:41] <sortiz> I'm fixing my NativeHelpers-Blob module for a change in the REPR of CStruct, so I need to known on what version the change was introduced.

[21:45] <MasterDuke> rj: say $*VM.version

[21:46] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 08b449e1a: OUTPUT: «v1.8␤»

[21:47] <MasterDuke> does NativeCall even work with the JVM and/or JS backends? would it be better to check the Perl6/Rakudo version?

[21:52] <sortiz> Yep, can be better.

[22:02] <timotimo> oh hey sortiz 

[22:03] <sortiz> Hi timotimo!

[22:06] <timotimo> we should really look into getting those functionalities into moarvm proper :S

[22:08] <sortiz> Yep, but in the mean time I'm releasing a quick fix.

[22:10] <timotimo> yes, sure

[22:11] <timotimo> did you see what the change was for? :)

[22:13] <sortiz> The REPR body was simplified moving the real pointer to the head. I suspect for ease the JITing

[22:14] <timotimo> aye

[22:14] <timotimo> the jit actually got a cool new feature that makes nativecalls even closer to native calls than ever before

[22:14] <timotimo> but passing a CStruct was - until then - making it fall back to the simpler method

[22:17] *** robertle left
[22:19] <sortiz> Great

[22:21] <patrickb> I now ran my reloc branches through a full spectest and had no regressions. I also did some performance measurements an the branch comes out roughly as fast or slightly faster as before.

[22:22] <sortiz> I now have very few spare time for perl6, I hope to follow the development more closely soon.

[22:28] <timotimo> as always there's the p6weekly :) :)

[22:30] *** MasterDuke left
[22:31] <patrickb> As far as I can see I have nothing left to do on my relocatability branches. I did not test on all platforms though (the BSDs, Mac and AIX are all untested).

[22:31] <patrickb> What is the best way to proceed now?

[22:32] <timotimo> hm, Kaiepi is our main BSD person i think?

[22:33] <timotimo> do you have experience with flatpack or appimage or snap or something similar?

[22:33] <patrickb> no

[22:33] <timotimo> OK

[22:33] <timotimo> do the platforms you've tested on include windows?

[22:33] <patrickb> Yes, I tested on linux and windows

[22:33] <patrickb> on windows I tried MinGW and VC

[22:33] <timotimo> nice

[22:34] <patrickb> VC was actually broken even without my changes. Got it to build again. :-P

[22:34] <timotimo> it's probably not much work, but we should make Star use this ASAP

[22:34] <timotimo> VC refering to MSVC?

[22:34] <patrickb> yes

[22:37] <Kaiepi> yeah timotimo

[22:37] <yoleaux> 18 Feb 2019 15:08Z <[Coke]> Kaiepi: I have sent you a few emails re: grant and received no response. please check spam filter, ping me at [email@hidden.address] (maybe I'm using wrong email address)

[22:37] <Kaiepi> already done

[22:37] <Kaiepi> what needs testing?

[22:39] <patrickb> Kaiepi: https://github.com/patzim/{MoarVM,nqp,rakudo}/tree/reloc

[22:42] <vrurg> patrickb: what's needed for mac testing? Just make & make test?

[22:42] <Kaiepi> aight

[22:43] <patrickb> thanks!

[22:46] <patrickb> vrurg: Yes.

[22:47] <patrickb> vrurg: If you want to go crazy, you can also do make install and then move the installation folder around and try if stuff still works.

[22:48] <patrickb> vrurg: actually to test the new runners you have to do make install and then run perl6 from the installation folder

[22:49] *** Kaiepi left
[22:49] *** Kaiepi joined
[22:50] <vrurg> patrickb: Would take me some time.

[22:50] <Kaiepi> patrickb, moar doesn't work on openbsd -current

[22:50] <Kaiepi> ld.so: moar: can't load library 'libmoar.so'

[22:51] <patrickb> Kaiepi: OK. Do you know something about rpath and $ORIGIN on OpenBSD?

[22:52] <Kaiepi> never used them before

[22:53] <patrickb> hm...

[22:53] <Kaiepi> rpath should work the same i think

[22:53] <Kaiepi> not sure about $ORIGIN, i'll tell you when my dns stops being a shit

[22:54] <patrickb> can you do `objdump -a -x moar` on the moar executable?

[22:54] <Kaiepi> sure

[22:55] <patrickb> objdump -a -x moar | grep RPATH

[22:55] <Kaiepi> empty

[22:55] <patrickb> ugh

[22:57] <patrickb> Kaiepi: `grep LDFLAGS Makefile`#Can you paste the first line this returns?

[22:58] <Kaiepi> LDFLAGS   =  -O3 -DNDEBUG -Wl,-z,origin,-rpath,'$$ORIGIN/../lib'

[22:58] <patrickb> that looks good

[22:59] * patrickb suspects he will have to set up a OpenBSD VM...

[23:01] <Kaiepi> would it be related to libuv's procfs-exepath.o?

[23:01] <patrickb> Kaiepi: I don't think so.

[23:01] <Kaiepi> hm

[23:01] <patrickb> It seems the moar executable is missing the required rpath.

[23:02] <patrickb> objdump should return something like: "  RPATH                $ORIGIN/../lib"

[23:02] <patrickb> but the LDFLAGS you have in the Makefile look good according to https://lekensteyn.nl/rpath.html#openbsd

[23:04] <patrickb> Kaiepi: An easy test to see whether it's the rpaths fault is to do `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libmoarso moar`

[23:04] <Kaiepi> openbsd doesn't use LD_LIBRARY_PATH iirc

[23:05] <patrickb> Ugh. Is there any substitute?

[23:05] <Kaiepi> ldconfig -r | grep moar is empty

[23:07] <patrickb> what does that do?

[23:09] <Kaiepi>      ldconfig is used to prepare a set of “hints” for use by the run-time

[23:09] <Kaiepi>      linker ld.so(1) to facilitate quick lookup of shared libraries available

[23:09] <Kaiepi>      in multiple directories.  

[23:09] <Kaiepi> -r lists the contents of ld.so.hints

[23:09] <patrickb> did you try the LD_LIBRARY_PATH thing? https://man.openbsd.org/ldconfig.8 < seems to indicate it works on OpenBSD...

[23:09] <AlexDaniel> sortiz: thank you

[23:10] <vrurg> patrickb: was distracted by urgent matter... nqp configure complains on too old version of moar.

[23:10] <AlexDaniel> (for working on NativeHelpers-Blob)

[23:10] <Kaiepi> patrickb, still doesn't load the library

[23:11] <patrickb> vrurg: Did you use the reloc branch in all three repos?

[23:11] <vrurg> Yes.

[23:11] <patrickb> vrurg: And did you install MoarVM and gave the same prefix to nqp?

[23:12] <vrurg> One sec, I have master branch installed in my path. 

[23:12] <vrurg> Nah, that's not it.

[23:12] <vrurg> Found /Users/vrurg/perl6.reloc/bin/moar version 2015.08-5063-gdcfa5f15a, which is too old. Wanted at least 2018.12-94-g2eab275df

[23:13] <patrickb> Kaiepi: OK. I'm out of ideas atm. Will have to look closer (will probably set up a VM).

[23:13] <sortiz> AlexDaniel: Thank you for the original report

[23:13] <patrickb> Kaiepi: If you want to dig in yourself some - feel free!

[23:14] <patrickb> vrurg: Then you have the wrong repo, give me a moment

[23:14] <vrurg> Fetch URL: [email@hidden.address]
[23:15] <patrickb> vrurg: and then check out the reloc branch

[23:15] <vrurg> 'He did it twice!' ;)

[23:15] <patrickb> :-)

[23:16] <vrurg> git branch: \n * reloc

[23:18] <patrickb> vrurg: Is it working now?

[23:19] <vrurg> Now, still the same. Checked for no other nqp/moar in the path – nah, the moar in ~/perl6.reloc is the only I have.

[23:21] <vrurg> s/now/no/

[23:21] <patrickb> what does moar -version print?

[23:23] <timotimo> double dashes btw

[23:23] <patrickb> Kaiepi: Thanks for your help so far! I hope we'll get this sorted out soon...

[23:26] <vrurg> patrickb: This is MoarVM version 2015.08-5063-gdcfa5f15a built with JIT support

[23:26] <vrurg> And this is from ./Configure.pl --backends=moar --prefix ~/perl6.reloc: Found /Users/vrurg/perl6.reloc/bin/moar version 2015.08-5063-gdcfa5f15a, which is too old. Wanted at least 2018.12-94-g2eab275df

[23:27] <patrickb> vrurg: Let's try a fresh start. These are the commands I use to build a MoarVM:

[23:27] <patrickb> git clone [email@hidden.address]
[23:27] <patrickb> cd MoarVM/

[23:27] <patrickb> git checkout reloc

[23:28] <patrickb> ./Configure.pl --prefix=../install

[23:28] <patrickb> make && make install

[23:29] <patrickb> #same failure on my side!

[23:29] <patrickb> at least I can reporoduce now :-P

[23:31] <vrurg> patrickb: That's the best part.

[23:31] * vrurg is crazy about a method behaving differently with seemingly same parameters.

[23:33] <vrurg> patrickb: ping me if you get it fixed. I'll be doing my other stuff.

[23:33] <patrickb> vrurg: OK. Thanks so far!

[23:34] <vrurg> NP, welcome! BTW, I'm available until 11pm EST.

[23:43] <patrickb> vrurg: Quick fix: rm -rf .git in MoarVM before calling Configure.

[23:43] <patrickb> :-/

[23:47] <vrurg> patrickb: Found ../install/bin/moar version 2018.12, which is too old. Wanted at least 2018.12-94-g2eab275df

[23:47] <patrickb> cleaner solution: Call `git remote add official https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM.git && git fetch official` before Configure

[23:47] <patrickb> argh!

[23:47] <patrickb> Sorry, you'll have to do a new clone :-/

[23:47] *** j3nnn1 left
[23:48] <vrurg> with .git delete its inevitable. ;)

[23:48] <vrurg> *deleted

[23:48] <patrickb> so just to make sure we get it right this time:

[23:48] <patrickb> git clone [email@hidden.address]
[23:48] <patrickb> cd MoarVM/

[23:49] <patrickb> git remote add official https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM.git && git fetch official

[23:49] <patrickb> ./Configure.pl --prefix=../install

[23:49] <patrickb> cat src/gen/config.h |grep VERSION

[23:49] <patrickb> ^ that should give 2018.08-28-g0f77a741a

[23:50] <vrurg> Yep, that's the line!

[23:51] <vrurg> But what about nqp? It still requires newer moar!

[23:52] <patrickb> ?!?

[23:53] <vrurg> When I try building nqp from your repo and reloc branch it fails to configure.

[23:53] <patrickb> I see it

[23:53] <patrickb> give me a moment

[23:54] <vrurg> But that's not relevant now. moar is not relocatable:

[23:54] <vrurg> dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/vrurg/tmp/MoarVM/../install/lib/libmoar.dylib

[23:55] <vrurg> macOS has very strict rules with regard to locating dynamic libraries.

[23:55] <vrurg> not sure if your idea would ever work here.

[23:57] <patrickb> did you move the folder?

[23:58] <vrurg> Yes

[23:58] <patrickb> and it works without moving the folder?

[23:58] <vrurg> It does.

[23:58] <vrurg> ~/tmp/install/bin/moar --version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20-02-19 18:58

[23:58] <vrurg> This is MoarVM version 2018.08-28-g0f77a741a built with JIT support
