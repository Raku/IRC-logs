[21:11] <[Coke]> any core devs that grok libuv other than jnthn?

[21:12] <timotimo> maybe we can figure out the problem even if we don't grok libuv as much

[21:13] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3057

[21:13] <[Coke]> My best guess is that the native descriptor being referenced in bind-stdin is not being released.

[21:14] <timotimo> Proc::Sync?

[21:16] <timotimo> yeah, we're holding on for too long for some reason

[21:16] <timotimo> huh. i wonder if bind-stdin doesn't properly cause an stdin/stdout pipe not to be created

[21:16] <timotimo> like, is it creating the socketpair and then just not using it at all?

[21:17] <timotimo> an strace would probably be able to tell if the files that are being leaked have anything written to/read from them

[21:24] <[Coke]> Im on a mac. So I think it'd be ktrace here, and I'm not sure how to steer it.

[21:25] <timotimo> oh, i think it's actually dtruss

[21:27] <[Coke]> timotimo: https://gist.github.com/coke/1781c6c10ed35c385f1cc4c931bbde06

[21:27] <timotimo> ouchies, that tab makes my computer seriously unhappy

[21:28] <timotimo> dtrace: error on enabled probe ID 2174 (ID 168: syscall::read:return): invalid kernel access in action #12 at DIF offset 68

[21:28] <timotimo> i have no idea what that could be about

[21:28] <timotimo> why is there no dtruss otuput between 1 and 16?

[21:44] <[Coke]> no clue. threaded and it output weird?

[21:48] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/45bbc9465c9d77e26c1584b15ce6500507948d51/src/core/Proc/Async.pm6#L231-L239

[21:49] <ugexe> the IO::Handle multi auto closes them. the pipe multi does not. 

[21:59] <ugexe> doesn't help

[22:03] <ugexe> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/45bbc9465c9d77e26c1584b15ce6500507948d51/src/core/Proc/Async.pm6#L283-L285 -- could this be losing the stdin-fd?
