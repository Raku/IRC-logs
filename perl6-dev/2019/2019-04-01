[08:46] <timotimo> who wants to look into making $foo .= &bar more optimized? it'd be a transformation in Perl6::Optimizer

[08:46] <timotimo> currently it goes through dispatch:<var>

[08:47] * lizmat suggest making an issue for it?

[08:48] <timotimo> i wonder if this could be called a low-hanging fruit

[19:39] <vrurg> BTW, is it normal for JVM backend to fail some tests with 'No subtests run' diag?

[19:41] <timotimo> that sounds like a premature exit

[19:46] <bartolin> vrurg: unfortunately, the JVM isn't in a particular good shape. but at the moment at least roast shouldn't give many errors

[19:48] <vrurg> Basically I just need to know that it has nothing to do with my macos or the changes to Configure I implement. Thanks!

[19:48] <vrurg> Actually, tests in a Linux VM failed the very same way on the default Configure. Ok. ;)
