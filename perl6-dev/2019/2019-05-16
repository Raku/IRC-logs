[01:51] <Kaiepi> anyone on that can help me with some QAST stuff?

[02:01] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: i'm very much not an expert and make no promises, but what's the problem?

[02:01] <Kaiepi> i can't figure out how to pass an array to a RI method

[02:02] <Kaiepi> through a QAST::Op

[02:02] <Kaiepi> from actions

[02:04] <MasterDuke> what have you tried?

[02:05] <Kaiepi> i've tried using a rakudo array, creating the sc for it, and passing it through a QAST::WVal, but since it's an array of blocks, i get this error:

[02:05] <Kaiepi> The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific

[02:05] <Kaiepi> implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside

[02:07] <MasterDuke> not using a QAST::Var?

[02:13] <Kaiepi> haven't tried that

[02:13] <Kaiepi> i'll see if it works

[02:35] <Kaiepi> nope MasterDuke, same error

[21:29] <Kaiepi> jnthn, you on?

[21:30] <Kaiepi> or anyone good with QAST

[21:30] <timotimo> i am decent at qast

[21:32] <timotimo> what's the issue Kaiepi?

[21:32] <Kaiepi> so for parallelizing feed operators, i have Rakudo::Internals.EVALUATE-FEED working, but i'm having trouble actually passing a list of callbacks to the method because i get an error about ForeignCode being a rakudo-specific implementation or something

[21:33] <timotimo> interesting. did you get a backtrace with --ll-exception that got you close to the exact spot where that happens?

[21:34] <Kaiepi> it doesn't help

[21:34] <Kaiepi> bastille% ./perl6-m --ll-exception -e 'say ([1,2,3] ==> map { $_ ** 2 })'

[21:34] <Kaiepi> The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific

[21:34] <Kaiepi> implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside

[21:34] <timotimo> m: say Int.^attributes[0].^find_method("name").^methods

[21:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: ¬´{!set_name => The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific‚ê§implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside, add_dispatchee => The 'ForeignCode' class is a Rakudo-specific‚ê§implementation detail and has no serviceable parts inside, clone =‚Ä¶¬ª

[21:35] <timotimo> ^- this came from trying to .gist a code object

[21:35] <timotimo> a code object that's too low-level to be friendly for introspection

[21:35] <timotimo> ah, right, it's more a warning than an error

[21:36] <timotimo> go to src/core/Rakudo/Internals.pm6 and on line 465 inside role ImplementationDetail make the gist method "die" with the text rather than just return it

[21:38] <timotimo> then you can get the backtrace you want

[21:41] <Kaiepi> ok

[22:22] <jnthn> Kaiepi: Somewhere you'll usually want to take the QAST::Block and make a thunk from it or something; it's been a while since I did anything in actions, but search for things like create_code_object or make_topic_block or so on for inspiration

[22:22] <jnthn> Note you'll need to make sure you're calling block_closure too so you don't get over-sharing

[23:07] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo, et al.: any thoughts on https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/532 after the most recent change?

[23:09] <timotimo> the thing with comma is that comma already has profiling stuff in released versions

[23:10] <MasterDuke> how does it do it?

[23:10] <jnthn> It uses --profile-filename=... iirc

[23:11] <jnthn> I think we'd probably have to support that for a migration period

[23:13] <MasterDuke> so change --profile=, but leave --profile-filename= and --profile-kind= for now?

[23:15] <jnthn> Yeah, though I'm pretty sure it's not passing --profile-kind

[23:15] <jnthn> Maybe you could emit a warning if they're used?

[23:15] <jnthn> And note they're going away at <some date>?

[23:15] <MasterDuke> sure

[23:15] <jnthn> We can adapt in Comma but we'll have to do it conditional on the Rakudo version we see.

[23:15] <jnthn> So we don't break on things prior to this merge

[23:15] <jnthn> So it'll need compat handling on both sides, just in different directions

[23:15] <MasterDuke> do you want to wait until after the next release?

[23:16] <jnthn> To merge this?

[23:16] <MasterDuke> yeah

[23:17] <MasterDuke> assuming i make the relevant changes before the next release

[23:17] <jnthn> Not sure it helps; I mean, I'd want to have Comma's choice of what to pass predicated on a released Rakudo version

[23:17] <jnthn> So it's chicken and egg.

[23:17] <jnthn> So probably just merge it when it's ready

[23:17] <timotimo> we didn't have --profile-kind yet

[23:17] <MasterDuke> ok

[23:18] <jnthn> timotimo: ah, yes :)

[23:24] <jnthn> sleep time o/
