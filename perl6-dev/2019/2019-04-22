[19:46] <timotimo> could y'all try rakudo.org on https?

[19:46] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v squashable6

[19:46] <timotimo> also perl6.wakelift.de on ssl and docs.perl6.wakelift.de

[19:47] <robertle> all three work for me

[19:48] <gfldex> same

[19:48] <robertle> perl6.wakelift.de seems to load some contents from another source, which my browser reports to have blocked

[19:48] <robertle> can't quite see anything missing though 

[19:50] <timotimo> oh, let's see

[19:50] <timotimo> i don't get any output, can you see what it is?

[19:51] <robertle> don't get it. everything it loads comes from that site, except jquery.min.js, which also comes over https

[19:51] <gfldex> i see ajax.googleapis.com

[19:51] <timotimo> ah

[19:51] <timotimo> i get that via decentraleyes

[19:51] *** AlexDani` left
[19:52] <gfldex> so it might not work in china

[19:52] *** AlexDani` joined
[19:52] <timotimo> hm, or not

[19:55] <robertle> I think my browser is stupid, all that content clearly comes over https, so there is no reason to mark it as mixed content...

[19:59] <timotimo> https://perl6.nl/ and https://docs.perl6.nl should also soon work just fine

[20:06] <ugexe> we dont use cloudflare because some people don't want cloudflare seeing their traffic, but its ok to pull down jquery from google?

[20:07] <timotimo> i can change it to be hosted on perl6.org; also, there's an extension that makes CDN stuff go via a different service (and cached locally), but there's no such thing to get around cloudflare i think?

[20:07] <timotimo> hm, i wonder

[20:07] <timotimo> would we be able to ssh into www.p6c.org or hack.p6c.org or even the vm host in the case of a DDoS attack on the server?

[20:08] <timotimo> i.e. is there a possibility to get a different network path to the vm host so that we can use the local console via virt-manager, for instance?

[20:08] <lizmat> I guess moritz would knnow

[20:10] <gfldex> Datacenters tend to have 2 separated uplinks. But they run as failovers.

[20:16] <ugexe> i'd be interested to hear if someone is actually against using a CDN or if that fear is just theoretical hackernews discussion

[20:17] <gfldex> having the whole show mirror friendly would be nice

[20:18] <gfldex> that would allow us to run acutal mirrors and if folk don't like cdns, they can feed their local mirror via a vpn

[20:23] <ugexe> i have to imagine there would be a speed boost for zef when fetching the ecosystem list, since just timo hosting the docs was significantly faster for where i am

[20:24] <timotimo> actually it's sena_kun hosting; it's a digitalocean droplet

[20:24] <timotimo> Camelia Delivery Network

[20:28] <gfldex> are there any DBs on any of those sites?

[20:38] <timotimo> databases? like SQL?

[20:46] <gfldex> yes

[20:51] <timotimo> modules.perl6.org stores its stuff in an sqlite database, but other than that i'm not aware of any

[20:53] <gfldex> sqlite is one of the easy targets for rsync. There is still a cronjob needed tho.

[20:54] <gfldex> Or the script that is running updates on the db creates the backup itself just before changing data.

[23:03] <AlexDaniel> definitely better than the mess we had in rakudo/rakudo

[23:04] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: I'm a bit worried that it probably puts a bit too much strain on you

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> but your responses are extremely helpful and on point :)

[23:16] *** vrurg left
[23:16] *** vrurg joined
[23:27] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Yeah, I'm glad of the separation; in some senses it's a bit less strain in that problem-solving will often be about unblocking things others wish to do, and having those things easily located is helpful.

[23:30] *** vrurg left
[23:31] *** vrurg joined
[23:31] <jnthn> Also, will depend on the rate at which things are placed there, and how it intersects with times when I've a bunch of other things to do (or when I decide I need a vacation :))

[23:33] <jnthn> Certainly, though, growing more people into the role of evaluating these things would be good. It's easy for me to put a +1 on a response I agree with. :)

[23:35] <jnthn> Sleep time now; expect to have some Perl 6 hacking tuits this week  :)
