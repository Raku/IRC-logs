[01:35] <vrurg> .ask pmurias Is it possible to teach nqp-js to load modules with relative path? I tried setting libpath to blib, ./blib but in vain. Only @base_dir@/blib works.

[01:35] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to pmurias

[01:36] <vrurg> .tell pmurias it also fails to load CORE.c.setting.js from ./ For the same reason, I guess.

[01:36] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to pmurias

[03:08] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: Well, if it makes things easier in the long run, I am not against it.

[03:08] <Xliff> For now, I don't see any need to change things if it does the job.
