[16:15] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: special delivery https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FuRvVGH3/blin-output-2019-08-29.tar.gz

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> holy moly

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> that doesn't look good at all

[16:18] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: we have an emergency lol xD

[16:18] <japhb> AlexDaniel: Not looking at the tarball, but if you're seeing a lot of failed installs, it might be because YAMLish won't install right now.  Author is aware.

[16:18] <japhb> https://github.com/Leont/yamlish/issues/29

[16:19] *** ufobat__ left
[16:19] <AlexDaniel> haha that svg output

[16:22] <AlexDaniel> japhb: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3132#issuecomment-526260444

[16:22] <AlexDaniel> ahhh these are not even related to yamlish

[16:22] <AlexDaniel> because they bisected to a different commit

[16:25] <AlexDaniel> ahhhh ignore that, it's probably because of multiple issues in the same range

[16:29] <kawaii> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news ;)

[16:33] <AlexDaniel> ok that's about it, not that bad now that I look at it

[16:40] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: will check. I wish I could run blin on my side...

[16:44] *** MasterDuke joined
[17:04] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: so what's the reason you can't?

[17:04] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: set up a VM, install perl6 and blin, run it

[17:05] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also you can download that .tar.gz mentioned above and see the output of each module

[17:06] <AlexDaniel> tobs: btw this one is really annoying: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/45

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> tobs: I can explain why it doesn't work right now. Or at least my limited understanding of how it works at all

[17:13] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: oh, without #45 resolved blin would be useless anyway. I'll wait when branches are supported then.

[17:19] <tobs> AlexDaniel: that sounds like a really cool feature indee

[17:19] <tobs> d

[17:20] <tobs> oh, it's already implemented but buggy? Anyway I have to go afk for a bit

[17:30] <AlexDaniel> tobs: it doesn't work

[17:30] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yeah, thanks, blin is useless, alright xD

[17:30] <AlexDaniel> :D

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> I mean, I get it, but there's indeed something about the idea that contributions are not appreciated enough

[17:31] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: oops... Sorry, fixing the issue, skipping "extra" words. ;) useless for me, apparently.

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> (in open-source projects in general)

[17:37] <AlexDaniel> tobs: it's possible that it is a one-line patch to make it work. So, here's what's going on. Bots have a rakudo repo (REPO-CURRENT in build.p6) which they use to look up commits and stuff

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> tobs: which means that running something on HEAD will get you the most recent commit on master of that repo

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> so far so good

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> when a new commit lands in rakudo, build.p6 script will `git pull` and start building stuff

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> however, we don't want the bots to know about these new commits, otherwise running something on HEAD will fail because there's no build yet

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> for that reason there's a separate git repo (REPO-LATEST in build.p6) that is used for building stuff, and when done, it just pulls in REPO-CURRENT from REPO-LATEST

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> here: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/0572755c90633274d966a9ec6dff0dc673c19ec1/xbin/build.p6#L152

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> and that's exactly the line where it doesn't work

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> because git pull like that won't pull the branches

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> well not only that line, because this script itself also doesn't produce the builds for branches, so yeah. But without that the bots won't see stuff too

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> well the good thing is that that's the only file we'll need to tweak

[17:46] *** Kaypie is now known as Kaiepi

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> so somewhere within 240 lines lies the answer

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> tobs: also fwiw I'd prefer to turn it into a service just like any other bot, so that we can then resolve this also: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/207

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> tobs: I'm a bit worried about touching that script, because in the past rakudo used to break apart if I did something differently‚Ä¶

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> like, this stuff for example is against memory leaks: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/0572755c90633274d966a9ec6dff0dc673c19ec1/xbin/build.p6#L157

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> but all that is no longer relevant, I guess?

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> and if not we'll see

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> ‚ÄúThe ‚Äú1.0‚Äù for the Perl 6 spec (6.c, because reasons) was released in 2015‚Äù

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> yeah, fixable or not, I think it is stupid

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> sorry :)

[22:51] *** dogbert17 left
[23:34] <AlexDaniel> yay

[23:36] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: One slight issue with the voting thing: I think any change to a PR invalidates existing approvals.

[23:37] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: yeah, it's unfortunate, I'm not sure what would be the solution

[23:37] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: for this PR in particular maybe we shouldn't push any new changes after we start voting, but for future stuff some solution is needed‚Ä¶

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> github can automatically invalidate reviews after new stuff is pushed, should I enable that?

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> but then people will have to approve more than once, which is annoying

[23:38] <jnthn> Hm, I hadn't realized it was an option; I thought pushing new stuff always invalidated the existing approvals

[23:39] <AlexDaniel> it's currently disabled

[23:39] <jnthn> I'd rather not leave the door open to "I approved, but not of this change"

[23:39] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: which means?

[23:40] <jnthn> Somebody reads it and approves. Then there's a change. If their approval sticks, rather than being invalidated by the change and needing re-approval, they could quite legitimately argue that they didn't actually approve the final resulting PR that was merged.

[23:40] <AlexDaniel> so I should turn it on?

[23:40] <jnthn> My feeling would be yes. I guess it's been turned on on other repos I've worked on and I never realized it was an option. :)

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> it's a thing that's available for protected branches only, we don't use it anywhere else that much

[23:42] <jnthn> Ah, ok

[23:43] <AlexDaniel> alright, jnthn++

[23:44] <jnthn> Even with that, I'm not really sure how we handle things best, in so far as presumably if somebody requsets changes, we want to encourage a dialog, not just immediately consider that there was no consensus and so the PR is doomed. :)

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> that's exactly what I had in mind

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> maybe it should be clarified in the README, or something like that

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> well, I'll definitely write a comment if somebody rejects :)

[23:45] <jnthn> Maybe we want to say there's a 2 week window by default, but also the last N days of that are a change freeze to give folks chance to get their votes in, and if we really need to change it inside those N days, it has to be stretched. Maybe that has its own problems.

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> ooo that'd be nice

[23:47] <jnthn> It's not how things are, but I do wish we'd had chance to polish the problem-solving process a bit more before it had to deal with such a substantive issue. :)

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> I'm sure that problem-solving repo will be tweaked even more now that'll see things in action

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I didn't see the naming issue coming that soon‚Ä¶

[23:47] <jnthn> otoh, I'm happy with the overall way it's worked so far, in that most folks have been civil, and GitHub has the means to deal with the exceptions to that

[23:50] <jnthn> haha...that latest post on #81 makes me want to to go Kyoto to ride the Raku bus :D

[23:50] <jnthn> Time for some rest...'night o/

[23:51] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: should I ping the reviewers to encourage them to suggest changes to the PR?

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> lizmat is currently away, but once she's back she'll be able to adjust the PR, I think
