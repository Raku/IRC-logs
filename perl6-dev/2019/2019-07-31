[08:09] <patrickb> nine: I'm pondering the problem of Configure.pls --libdir option being broken. An idea I have is removing that option and instead add an option --perl6-home and --nqp-home. Those specify where the respective folders will be installed and expected. Then it's possible to put the entirety of the current share/nqp or share/perl6 folders somewhere else 

[08:09] <patrickb> (e. g. /usr/lib/nqp and /usr/lib/perl6).

[08:11] <patrickb> nine: Would that satisfy the needs of packaging on SuSE and similar? What's your opinion?

[08:15] <nine> patrickb: the problem is that the file system hierarchy standard requires program libraries to be in /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 and architecture independend data to be in /usr/share

[08:17] <patrickb> These home folders only contain architecture independent data. Namely perl6 itself and the repositories.

[08:17] <nine> This definition leaves an open question: what about architecture independend program libraries?

[08:17] <patrickb> Right. :-)

[08:17] <nine> This is where different distributions or rather their maintainers may have different opinions.

[08:18] <nine> FWIW openSUSE's Perl maintainer was fine with my explanation about moarvm precomp files being architecture independent and moving them to /usr/share

[08:18] <patrickb> But as far as I see the home folders are homogenous in this regard. So there should never be the need to take the contents of them apart (i. e. put the repos in one place and the perl6 libraries in another).

[08:19] <nine> /usr/share/perl6/runtime/dynext/libperl6_ops_moar.so OTOH is a real isuse

[08:19] <nine> s/isuse/issue/

[08:19] <patrickb> Oh!

[08:20] <nine> Of course the best solution for that one is to get rid of extops...

[08:20] <patrickb> We could just sweep that under the carpet until we manage to get rid of the ext ops...

[08:20] <patrickb> Yes.

[08:20] <nine> Yes, that's the current approach

[08:21] <patrickb> Ok, so removing the broken --libdir option in rakudo and nqp is a first step.

[08:22] <patrickb> Then afterwards we can see if adding the possibility to move the home folders is necessary.

[08:22] <nine> sounds good

[08:23] <patrickb> OK. Thanks for the feedback!
