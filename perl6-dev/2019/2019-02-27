[00:03] <patrickb> vrurg: Ping

[00:05] <vrurg> patrickb: Is it still the same repo/branch?

[00:06] <patrickb> yes, unchanged

[00:07] *** dct joined
[00:07] <vrurg> Hm, git pull doesn't update.

[00:08] <patrickb> I didn't change anything

[00:08] <patrickb> It just worked on my side.

[00:10] <patrickb> I'm mostly interested on the output `otool -l moar` and `otool -l libmoar.dylib` that might help in finding the cause of why it doesn't work on your side

[00:12] <vrurg> Ok, where can I send the output?

[00:15] <patrickb> vrurg: can you also send me your Makefile?

[00:16] <vrurg> done

[00:20] <patrickb> vrurg: the @moarshared@ config variable is somehow set wrong

[00:20] <patrickb> you have no changes in Configure.pl or setup.pm?

[00:20] <patrickb> Did you pass --no-relocatable to Configure.pl?

[00:29] *** patrickz joined
[00:30] <patrickz> vrurg: I have no idea how you ended up with that Makefile.

[00:31] <patrickz> Can you verify you are on commit dcfa5f15a3a8ea8e9683fd9278923028ab99fbe1

[00:38] <patrickb> vrurg: ^

[00:40] <vrurg> patrickb: Sorry, I was away. 

[00:40] <vrurg> I didn't use no-relocable, actually.

[00:41] <patrickb> You shouldn't have, so that's good.

[00:41] <patrickb> Is the commit ID the same?

[00:42] <patrickb> I suspect there is some foul git magic at work here...

[00:42] <vrurg> And even worse, I did a clean checkout but forgot to switch branches. My bad!

[00:42] <vrurg> Doing thins on the run isn't a smart thing...

[00:43] <vrurg> Unknown option: no-relocable

[00:43] <vrurg> The branch is 'reloc' now. 

[00:43] <patrickb> Configure.pl --no-relocatable

[00:43] <patrickb> but you shouldn't use it!

[00:44] <vrurg> Ah, ok, I did get you wrong then. 

[00:45] <vrurg> Plain ./Configure.pl --prefix=../install must work as expected, right? 

[00:45] <patrickb> yes

[00:45] <vrurg> building. 

[00:46] *** AlexDaniel joined
[00:46] <vrurg> And it works.

[00:47] <patrickb> also when renaming the install folder?

[00:47] <vrurg> Sure, this is what I'm testing for in first place. :)

[00:48] <patrickb> Whoot!

[00:48] <patrickb> I think then there are no blockers left for my branch!

[00:48] <vrurg> If nothing has changed since my last test then something escaped my attention that time. Because I know for sure that it was THE branch and it was the same Configure command line.

[00:48] <patrickb> Thank you very much for your help!

[00:49] <vrurg> patrickb: welcome! My pleasure!

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> samcv: that's it, I think we're ready

[04:48] <AlexDaniel> so yeah, Blin doesn't show anything new, Releasable was happy yesterday, canary is green, perl6-j can be built fine

[04:48] <AlexDaniel> but…

[04:48] <AlexDaniel> appveyor is red…

[04:51] <AlexDaniel> seems like some tests are just flapping

[04:52] <AlexDaniel> yeah, well. That sucks, but I don't think that's new…

[04:52] <AlexDaniel> samcv: green light from me

[05:18] <samcv> AlexDaniel, good morning. i just woke up. though earlier than i expected for whatever reason

[05:18] <samcv> ++to all for getting GSoC accepted

[06:11] <SmokeMachine> japhb: Red will still have DBIish drivers, but I’ll create new DB::* drivers...

[06:14] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: yes, it was... and it was doing CONTROL and CATCH to be sure...

[15:26] <japhb> SmokeMachine: If you have both installed, how will it pick between them?

[15:28] <SmokeMachine> my idea is defaults to DB::* but if you don't have it installed it tries DBIish... but you can `database "DBIish::SQLite"` or something like that if you wish

[15:30] <japhb> Ah, makes sense.

[15:30] <SmokeMachine> japhb: currently, if you do `database "SQLite"` it will use DBIish and if you do 'database "Pg"` it willl use DB::Pg
