[16:59] <yoleaux> 09:05Z <atroxaper> lizmat: You ask me about writing a blog post about LogP6. I did it if form of repository and step-by-step README. https://github.com/atroxaper/p6-LogP6-Blog-Example I do not know where can I post the readme as blog. Maybe you suggest me something.

[16:59] <lizmat> I posted it on /r/perl6 

[17:00] <lizmat> .tell atroxaper published link on /r/perl6, you could also consider posting it to Hacker News

[17:00] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to atroxaper.

[20:06] <gfldex> We warn on Nil in string context but we don't warn on Nil in a for loop.

[20:07] <gfldex> Is there actually a reason to for-loop over Nil?

[20:07] <gfldex> Other then to output it in a string. :->

[23:43] <patrickz> .tell vrurg I rebased your build-revamp branch to latest rakudo (including my changes to Makefile-Moar.in). The merge resides in https://github.com/patzim/rakudo/tree/build-revamp For some reason Github won't let me create a PR to your fork, so you'll have to pull the changes yourself. I hope that works out.

[23:43] <yoleaux> patrickz: I'll pass your message to vrurg.

[23:44] <vrurg> patrickz: thanks, I'll have a look at it!

[23:45] <vrurg> patrickz: you can't create PR because I forked from the main repo, not mine.
