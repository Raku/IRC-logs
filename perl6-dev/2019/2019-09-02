[14:07] <vrurg> .tell pmurias I'll try to handle JS backend makefile on my own but most likely you'd need to fix it afterwards. Perhaps if you can take care of python2.7 requirement for a node's module I would manage with it all on my own.

[14:07] <tellable6> vrurg, I'll pass your message to pmurias

[14:22] <Kaiepi> i'm making some changes to how rakudo deals with sync sockets' families, and it's complaining that this is getting gobbled:

[14:22] <Kaiepi>         Int    :$family    is copy where {

[14:22] <Kaiepi>                 $family == PF_UNSPEC

[14:22] <Kaiepi>              || $family == PF_INET

[14:22] <Kaiepi>              || $family == PF_INET6

[14:22] <Kaiepi>         } = PF_UNSPEC,

[14:22] <Kaiepi> what do i need to do to make it so it doesn't get gobbled?

[14:22] <timotimo> usually there's a second message that tells you what gobbles

[14:25] <Kaiepi> it's the PF_UNSPEC at the very end, do i just need parentheses or something?

[14:26] <timotimo> you could try that

[14:27] <timotimo> or perhaps the problem is that PF_UNSPEC and friends are not defined in this context

[14:27] <timotimo> which would mean they are interpreted as subs

[14:27] <Kaiepi> that could be the case, parentheses didn't work

[14:29] <timotimo> then you can comment out the problematic code and try just using PF_UNSPEC in a random line, like "say PF_UNSPEC;" and see if it fails to compile

[15:18] <Kaiepi> now the compiler's claiming there's a missing block in the signature for this, but i don't see where it's expecting there to be one http://fpaste.scsys.co.uk/585902

[15:19] <timotimo>         self.bless(:$host, :$port, :$family), |%rest)!initialize()

[15:19] <timotimo> one ) too much

[15:20] <Kaiepi> ah

[16:27] <jmerelo> .tell |Tux| I didn't remember I had the commit bit already. Anyway, I've done a PR to see if you're happy with it. 

[16:27] <tellable6> jmerelo, I'll pass your message to |Tux|

[16:32] <|Tux|> already merged :)

[16:42] <|Tux|> https://tux.nl/perl.html it is green again. Thanks jmerelo 

[16:43] <jmerelo> |Tux| sorry for being so very late...

[16:44] <|Tux|> no sweat. it is voluntay time

[16:44] <jmerelo> If you need any help with setting up the rest of the stuff, like notifications and such, just let me know.

[16:44] <|Tux|> voluntary

[16:44] <|Tux|> feel free to come with suggestions

[16:45] <jmerelo> |Tux| main thing is that we need to run it from within the container, or produce some file that can be processed from outside the container.

[16:46] <jmerelo> |Tux|: I'd have to check how it was done previously and try to sneak it back again, I guess. 

[16:46] <|Tux|> 1. I am to be honest not a docker fan: usually it is just a way to move the problem elsewhere

[16:46] <jmerelo> |Tux|: we need to re-submit the community setup for perl 6 in Travis, anyway. That's something else that needs to be done...

[16:47] <|Tux|> 2. When it works and does wanted feedback to the community, I'm all in favor

[16:49] <jmerelo> |Tux|: main reason I created them was tests taking 20 minutes to build Rakudo and then 30 seconds to do the actual testing. Now there are packages created by several members of the community, could be another option

[18:27] <kawaii> Uh, I don't suppose there was any update from the Rakudo Star maintainers was there?

[18:28] <kawaii> I did make an attempt at rolling my own Star but some things changed with the Rakudo scripts and the current Star release guide is invalid.
