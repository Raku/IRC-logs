[00:24] <timotimo> d'oh, the scope registered with .symbol on a QAST::Block doesn't distinguish between lexical and lexicalref, for instance

[00:32] <vrurg> timotimo: what's the difference? (/me is collecting knowledge)

[00:34] <timotimo> having parameters declared as lexicalref is related to "is rw"

[00:35] <vrurg> thanks!

[00:38] <timotimo> changing the scope from blah to blahref or backwards in a QAST::Var means the difference between being able to operate on a container or its value, at the very least for native refs, i.e. "int $a is rw"

[00:41] <vrurg> Wish there be more docs around for the internals than https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course provides.

[00:45] <vrurg> Anyway... The more I think about CoreClass:ver<6.x> notation the less I like it. It's not applicable to module versions but people would expected it to be. Perhaps having CORE.x:: namespaces would be better solution. Correspondingly, CORE.e::PseudoStash would provide the correct class.

[00:53] <timotimo> uuughhhh the definitions stmts has so many different possible kinds of entry

[00:57] <timotimo> just gotta build a fully recursive solution, aren't i

[14:43] <kawaii> AlexDaniel`: found the issue my version of libc6 was a little too old

[14:43] <kawaii> not sure how though since I'd run Blin on this same box before

[14:44] <kawaii> oh well, I pulled the latest from source and now Blin is happy

[15:05] <tbrowder> hi all

[15:09] <tbrowder> recent pod activity has highlighted an issue i think needs some clarification: should pod config keys be allowed to have empty values? from reading S26 i don't find an explicit answer, but my gut says the user shoud get an exeption in all such cases. i'm going to ask damian via e-mail.

[15:22] *** ufobat_ left
[15:23] <tbrowder> i just sent email to damian, but i would like to hear other opinions from this group.

[15:29] <ugexe> i would think the difference between empty string, null, and non-existence would be an important distinction. it often is in apis

[15:55] <tbrowder> ugexe: concur. i was not being precise, but i would reject: empty strings, empty hashes or arrays. zero integers would be ok as values.

[15:56] <tbrowder> and i would reject empty strings as keys.

[15:59] <tbrowder> S26 calls the config entries pairs and notes they must be constants, so i don't think rejecting empty values should be unexpected.

[16:06] <ugexe> why reject them? does allowing them cause confusion?

[16:07] <ugexe> i can do e.g. `FOO="" perl6 -e 'say %*ENV<FOO>:exists'` for instance, and get what i expect even if someone might interpt that the same as `FOO=`

[16:08] <ugexe> then again you are talking about *keys*, and my example is values

[16:09] <tbrowder> config accepts keys as True or False, hence no need for an empty key.

[16:09] *** pamplemousse left
[16:09] <tobs> yeah, I think there is no way to write a colonpair with an empty key. This issue is about empty values to non-empty keys, as far as I'm aware.

[16:09] <tbrowder> *key with empty value

[17:52] <Kaiepi> looking for a review, it's been up for a while

[17:53] <Kaiepi> i need this merged before i can start on the next stage of my grant work, implementing support for synchronous udp/unix/raw sockets

[17:54] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: a review from? I looked through the changes and it makes sense

[17:56] <Kaiepi> i was thinking jnthn maybe, it's the moarvm changes in particular that might need some tweaking if i chose the wrong type to represent socket families

[17:56] <AlexDaniel> given that it touches moarvm stuff the list of people is kinda small

[17:56] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> well, jnthn is in front of me‚Ä¶ but I don't think a review is going to come any time soon :)

[17:57] <Kaiepi> damn

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: so what exactly do you need for the grant? Having them merged?

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> I can merge

[17:58] <Kaiepi> yeah

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> what's up with lib/MAST/Ops.nqp file? Is it supposed to be changing that much?
