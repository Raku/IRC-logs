[06:08] <lizmat> Kaiepi: you don't need a commit bit to have a PR merged in Rakudo

[06:08] <lizmat> if you want a commit bit, you need to sign a CLA

[06:08] <lizmat> don't ask me why that is...  it just is  :-(

[06:22] <lizmat> Files=1269, Tests=109357, 192 wallclock secs (26.65 usr  7.86 sys + 2687.74 cusr 252.17 csys = 2974.42 CPU)

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: why so sad

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: we'll fix this

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> eventually

[07:30] <lizmat> AlexDaniel++   # positive spirit

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's on the list, see https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/64 . That said, most of the items on that list are probably not worth changing, but I'd say the CLA thing is not one of them unless someone has a good justification

[07:35] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: and there was a mini discussion on that too: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2019-07-08#l228

[07:40] <AlexDaniel> that works I guess

[07:41] <AlexDaniel> note: test

[12:30] <[Coke]> if someone wants to discuss CLA issues, allison at TPF is probably the first place I'd go. (not for processing them, but for "why do we even have that lever" discussions)

[14:55] <[Coke]> Got Kaiepi's CLA. Need a github id. (is it same?)

[14:55] <Kaiepi> https://github.com/Kaiepi

[14:56] <[Coke]> ah, I had spelled it wrong when checking.

[14:56] <[Coke]> ok. added to the spreadsheet.

[15:20] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: thank you

[15:22] <Kaiepi> with that is the grant work officially underway?

[18:32] <[Coke]> your work could be done in a fork. Didn't need permission to commit to rakudo master for that.

[18:32] <[Coke]> Sorry if that wasn't clear.

[18:32] <[Coke]> but I'm glad we have another interested party with a CLA.

[19:40] <brrt> lizmat jnthn timotimo - can any of you give pamplemousse a commit bit of NQP?

[19:41] <lizmat> I cannot afaik

[19:42] <timotimo> pamplemoussecache is the correct user name, yes?

[19:45] <timotimo> i've just invited @pamplemoussecache to the NQP team in the perl6 org

[19:47] *** pamplemousse joined
[19:51] <[Coke]> is that the same person?

[19:51] *** pamplemousse_ joined
[19:51] <timotimo> i think so

[19:51] <timotimo> either the same person, or a very dedicated impostor

[19:52] <[Coke]> heh

[19:54] *** pamplemousse left
[19:55] <brrt> yes

[19:55] <brrt> thanks timotimo++

[19:56] *** pamplemousse_ is now known as pamplemousse

[19:56] <timotimo> i mean, i guess "very" is an overstatement, since it's likely just a minute or two of work to pull all repos down and send them back up to your own account

[19:56] <pamplemousse> Thanks timotimo++

[19:56] <timotimo> yo

[19:58] <brrt> 'relatively dedicated impostor' ;-)

[19:58] <timotimo> "slightly motivated impostor"

[20:02] <pamplemousse> That's my github :) I promise I'm not an imposter

[20:02] <nine> That's what an impostor would say!

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> replacement for yoleaux almost ready, seems to be working but I'd rather double check with tests tomorrow

[20:30] <timotimo> pamplemousse: this "diego bbs benchmark" you've got on your github, that's not actually for what i think BBS means, right? the kind you'd dial into with a modem via its phone number to download and upload text messages?

[20:32] <timotimo> nothing in the readme of benchmarkbbs nor bbs actually makes clear that it isn't that kind of BBS

[20:41] <[Coke]> there is a "diego bbs"

[20:43] <[Coke]> it does seem to stand for bulletin board system, but I wonder if that's just an homage.

[20:43] <[Coke]> https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html#bbs

[20:47] <timotimo> aha, so it's a BBS for auctions

[20:47] <timotimo> i can only assume it's for auctioning off pieces of art

[22:31] <pamplemousse> I'm not really familiar with BBS in the original sense of the phrase, but my guess is they co-opted the term and since it doesn't sound similar to what you described

[22:41] <timotimo> i have actually also never connected to a BBS! i completely missed that very fascinating part of computer history

[23:43] <timotimo> i want to take the time to watch some of jason scott's documentaries, Get Lamp, and BBS: The Documentary in particular
