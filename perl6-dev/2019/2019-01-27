[14:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:

[14:25] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: to prevent exactly the problem that R#2650 describes.  Is spectest clean, so

[21:16] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:

[21:52] <lizmat> So how about we close down RT for Perl 6 issues ?

[21:52] <lizmat> or at least make it impossible to have new Perl 6 issues created ??

[21:53] <lizmat> should we migrate old bugs to github ?
