[08:20] <patrickb> .tell vrurg I have time this evening (/me in UTC+2). If you do to, we might finally manage to finish up #3031.

[08:20] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to vrurg.

[08:22] <nine> https://rakudo.org/downloads/nqp/ gives a 404. This breaks my packaging script

[08:56] <nine> AlexDaniel: both, NQP's and Rakudo's Configure.pl now try to use git to update a submodule. This should not happen with a release .tar.gz. Otherwise compiling an older release will try to update the configure submodule with a high likelyhood of breaking.

[08:57] <nine> Actually, lots of issues with builds and releases could be caught early by having a build on the Open Build Service become a part of the release process.

[09:06] <nine> Aaand yet another issue: [  134s] extracting debug info from /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/rakudo-2019.07-2.1.x86_64/usr/bin/perl6-debug-m

[09:06] <nine> [  134s] /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh: line 528: /dev/fd/62: No such file or directory

[09:09] <AlexDaniel> :S

[09:09] <AlexDaniel> nine: can you file all that as tickets?

[09:12] <nine> Where would I file an issue about rakudo.org?

[09:13] <nine> Ah, found it. And noticed that there are actually already a couple of tickets and have been there untouched for 2 months

[09:14] <AlexDaniel> yeah…

[09:15] <AlexDaniel> but personally I'm ok with github

[09:15] <AlexDaniel> even if we bring the downloads page back up, next time it breaks we'll have the same issues

[09:15] <nine> I wonder what's so hard about adding a single redirect of that download page to github

[09:16] <nine> AlexDaniel: with that line of reasoning, we shouldn't have a website at all, because it may break and cause issues

[09:16] <AlexDaniel> nine: it's not going to unbreak your script though? :)

[09:16] <|Tux|> Now that I am *not* working on that timing box, better timings:

[09:16] <|Tux|> Rakudo version 2019.07-63-gf66c238ff - MoarVM version 2019.07-9-ge07c0f252

[09:16] <|Tux|> csv-test-xs-20      0.422 -  0.431

[09:16] <|Tux|> csv-ip5xs           0.727 -  0.747

[09:16] <|Tux|> test-t --race       0.756 -  0.771

[09:16] <|Tux|> test-t              1.621 -  1.685

[09:16] <|Tux|> csv-ip5xs-20        5.047 -  5.115

[09:16] <|Tux|> test                6.059 -  6.862

[09:16] <|Tux|> test-t-20 --race    8.781 -  9.020

[09:16] <|Tux|> csv-parser         21.822 - 22.433

[09:16] <|Tux|> test-t-20          28.017 - 28.142

[09:17] <AlexDaniel> nine: well, to some extent, yeah. Most of the websites we had we shouldn't :)

[09:18] <nine> Anyway, I wonder why appropriate tests are still not part of our release guidlines?

[09:19] <AlexDaniel> there are a bunch of things tested and checked, just not the ones you're asking about right now :)

[09:20] <AlexDaniel> so you want no network access when building from a provided .tar.gz?

[09:21] <AlexDaniel> I mean, it's right, but what's the easiest way to test that?

[09:21] <nine> Of course. What'd be the point of having tar balls otherwise?

[09:21] <nine> Like I suggested earlier: use the Open Build Service

[09:22] <nine> With a simple `osc build` I immediately got the errors:

[09:22] <nine> [    3s] Can't exec "git": No such file or directory at Configure.pl line 14.

[09:22] <nine> [    3s] Can't exec "git": No such file or directory at Configure.pl line 34.

[09:22] <nine> [    3s] Can't exec "git": No such file or directory at Configure.pl line 35.

[09:23] <lizmat> is this something that can be fixed with 2019.08, or should we consider a 2019.07.1 ?

[09:25] <AlexDaniel> I have no problem with 2019.07.1, though 2019.07 is not going to break if I understand things correctly

[09:25] <nine> lizmat: the issue will hurt people who try to build older releases on machines with git installed. A point release wouldn't help there since the 2019.07 release will forever be affected.

[09:25] <AlexDaniel> it just requires git and network access

[09:26] <nine> AlexDaniel: no, the build actually runs without git (jay missing error checks!). I suspect it will break in the future with git installed since it will update the submodule to a newer and potentially backwards incompatible version

[09:27] <patrickb> So there needs to be a way to block submodule updating in releases.

[09:28] <AlexDaniel> wait, how come it's not pinned to a specific commit?

[09:29] <nine> What does it use git for anyway? The calls are obviously not needed as everything proceeds just fine with them failing.

[09:30] <AlexDaniel> yeah, it is pinned, of course

[09:30] <AlexDaniel> although… things are weird

[09:32] <AlexDaniel> so there's no git repo in the tar, so any action on the submodule is not going to work anyway, right?

[09:33] <nine> I guess so

[09:36] <AlexDaniel> and even if there is a git repo, it should still be pinned to 7411804dffa8d63c87956cc764727111537cd865

[09:37] <AlexDaniel> which also means that the last two commits in nqp-configure didn't make it into the release

[09:37] <AlexDaniel> is that right or am I missing something

[09:39] <AlexDaniel> so the only good reason for a point release is to get rid of annoying errors…

[09:40] * AlexDaniel afk for a bit

[09:44] <nine> Oh, the strange find-debuginfo.sh error disappeared on a second try

[09:44] <nine> But....there's new ones:

[09:44] <nine> [  120s] ERROR: RPATH "//usr/lib64" on /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/rakudo-2019.07-2.1.x86_64/usr/bin/perl6 is not allowed

[09:44] <nine> patrickb: ^^^

[09:58] <patrickb> nine: What does find-debuginfo.sh do?

[09:59] <nine> #find-debuginfo.sh - automagically generate debug info and file list

[09:59] <nine> #for inclusion in an rpm spec file.

[10:12] <patrickb> nine: I'm in a rather bad position to debug this. find-debuginfo.sh seems to be a script part of the rpm build process, which I have never done before. I'd be grateful if you could do some digging yourself. I have time this evening and can help where possible.

[10:34] <patrickb> Is looking for a .git folder a good way to check whether we are dealing with a release rakudo, i.e. no need for doing any submodule update stuff?

[10:36] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: that's going to work, yes. It makes sense not to run submodule commands if there's no git folder

[10:38] <patrickb> should be a two line change. I'll throw together a patch in the evening.

[10:39] <patrickb> btw. I'll be at TPC as well. Looking forward to seeing some of you IRL.

[10:39] * patrickb is afk

[10:39] <AlexDaniel> \o/

[10:41] <AlexDaniel> so if git is installed I get `fatal: not in a git directory`

[10:41] <AlexDaniel> but it doesn't affect the build at all, as far as I can see

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: ok, I don't think there's any reason for a point release

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> but maybe we should be checking for stuff on stderr

[10:44] <nine> patrickb: the find-debuginfo.sh thing seemed to be a one time only issue. The RPATH issue however persists

[10:46] <AlexDaniel> well, unless there's something else :)

[11:40] <AlexDaniel> why 2019.03.1 ?

[11:41] <AlexDaniel> so you're building rakudo 2019.03.1 on top of nqp 2019.07

[11:41] <nine> Why indeed?

[11:42] <nine> Aaaaah I was just looking too soon.

[11:42] <nine> The rebuild had not been triggered for all targets after I pushed the update to the new version. Looks like the actual build is proceeding just fine: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:niner9:branches:devel:languages:perl6/rakudo/openSUSE_Leap_15.0/x86_64

[11:42] <nine> AlexDaniel: thank you so much for pointing this out!

[11:44] <AlexDaniel> nine: as for improving the release process, I'm all for it, but I'm a bit out of steam as a release manager. Please file some tickets pointing out what can be improved

[11:45] <AlexDaniel> nine: though note that the release guide does say that a produced tar must be tested, and the Sakefile follows that. I simply didn't see the error on stderr and honestly didn't really look because all steps passed fine

[11:45] <nine> AlexDaniel: I wonder if we should actually take it a step further: automate packaging of every commit. That way the burden does not fall on the release manager but on the developer pushing

[11:46] <AlexDaniel> nine: so I don't know if osc is going to help with that particular issue, but if it does help with anything else I'm all for it

[11:46] <AlexDaniel> nine: I'd also love spectests for every commit…

[11:48] <AlexDaniel> because this time 6.d-errata spectest didn't even work, and nobody noticed

[11:48] <AlexDaniel> well, nobody except the release manager who of course had to run it (and that is automated too, so can't make a release without doing it, but still)

[11:49] <AlexDaniel> it's like 20 spectests per day max, or so, not that much cpu time really

[11:49] <AlexDaniel> well, ok, not max but average :)

[11:49] <nine> Even if....we actually have the computational ressources

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: so it's failing in travis sometimes

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> “This completes in .6s on 2018.03 but hangs on HEAD”

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> so it shouldn't be testing for 2x difference, 20x maybe?

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> if we want to test the hang, that is

[12:14] <AlexDaniel> and if the bug returns, it'll hang the whole test suite, right? :)

[12:16] <lizmat> well, we haz the tools to a. make the time given different on version / release, and b. have it time out if it hangs

[12:24] <nine> patrickb: MoarVM's Configure.pl doesn't set rpath in ldflags if $prefix eq '/usr' and rakudo must do so as well

[19:00] <AlexDaniel> patrickz: why is /usr special? Are there any other paths where the same treatment should be used?

[19:01] <patrickz> AlexDaniel: I think the idea is, that when installing to /usr it's a system wide installation. Then the lib would be located in /usr/lib and be in the library search path already.

[19:01] <AlexDaniel> :S

[19:01] <patrickz> The fix is pretty much copied directly from moar

[19:01] <AlexDaniel> that sounds kinda fragile

[19:01] <patrickz> Does!

[19:02] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:02] <patrickz> But fixing this better means turning changing the way moar has always done it. So for now I'd say we make sure it works as it worked in the past.

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> okay

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> patrickz: so https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/f1b26bb0e8f4e0a00ac31f9defb1ed74b820eb39 is related, right?

[19:06] <patrickz> Sort of related. But that change is irrelevant for rakudo as the rakudobuild does not create any libraries

[19:21] <patrickz> Time for another spaces-in-path try?

[19:24] <vrurg> Are we about nqp today?

[19:26] <patrickz> the spaces-in-path thing has changes in rakudo, nqp, nqp-configure and moarvm...

[19:27] <patrickz> Or maybe I didn't get the question.

[19:29] <vrurg> No, you got it right. :)

[19:29] *** ufobat_ left
[19:29] <vrurg> Sorry, just trying to multi-task. Might be asking wrong questions. 

[19:32] <vrurg> patrickz: did you branch your MoarVM?

[19:33] <patrickz> what do you mean? https://github.com/patzim/MoarVM/tree/spaces-in-path <- that's the branch...

[19:33] *** MasterDuke left
[19:36] <vrurg> Ok, that exactly what I needed.

[19:37] <vrurg> Another thing: it forcingly updates nqp-configure for me -> results in no read_config_from_command found.

[19:38] <vrurg> It's when I try Configure.pl from rakudo and it goes into nqp. This is weird because you wouldn't be able to build it on your side.

[19:40] <timotimo> greppable6: FromJSON

[19:40] <greppable6> timotimo, 32 lines, 5 modules: https://gist.github.com/e0c57c2199994626bd84417ef861bddb

[19:40] <patrickz> Hm. I never tried building using --gen-nqp or so. I always built rakudo, nqp and moar separately and before calling ./Configure in nqp or rakudo I checked out the spaces-in-nqp branch in 3rd-party/nqp-configure

[19:40] <vrurg> patrickz: I think you would need to pin the head of nqp-configure in your repo to nqp and rakudo repos for testing. Then reset it to perl6/nqp-configure after merge

[19:41] <vrurg> patrickz: Then you miss the most commonly used scenario and this may result in bugs.

[19:41] <patrickz> good point!

[19:42] <vrurg> Tried to configure nqp separately. Somethow it gives me: You asked me to build MoarVM, but 2018.12-332-g5fa053ce9 is not new enough to satisfy version 2019.05-94-g459e68675

[19:42] <vrurg> But MoarVM is checked out on space-in-path branch

[19:45] <patrickz> does your moar repo have the original moar remote and all of it's branches and tags fetched?

[19:45] <patrickz> There is some logic in there that retrieves that latest tag, which are only in the original rakudo repo...

[19:45] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: rba assigned to maettu Issue [WIP] perl6-infra overview https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/68

[19:45] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:46] <vrurg> patrickz: I build everything from your repos. MoarVM comes from there. build/mk-moar-pc.pl contains the 2018 version.

[19:47] <vrurg> And yes, tags are outdated in your repo.

[19:48] <vrurg> patrickz: I need to go now, will be back in ~2hrs. Mail me, please. 

[19:48] <patrickz> can you do `git remote add origin https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM.git && git fetch origin` in the moar checkout?

[19:48] *** lizmat left
[19:49] <vrurg> patrickz: I thought you were doing this to MoarVM too. Later. Thanks!

[19:55] <timotimo> i would like to have method write-uint64(Buf:U: $value) and friends, please

[19:56] <timotimo> also, default value for .read-uint64($offset = 0) and friends

[19:58] <timotimo> is it better to have an rfc ticket or a pull request with an implementation?

[20:24] <[Coke]> timotimo: is it controversial?

[20:24] <timotimo> dunno

[20:25] <[Coke]> if it's not hard to do, PRs make it easier to say yes, anyway

[20:33] <patrickz> Where are the submodule versions set?

[20:33] <timotimo> they are set by cd-ing into them, checking out a specific commit, then cd-ing back out and "git add"ing the submodule

[20:34] <timotimo> i.e. they behave a little bit like a file, but you can cd into them

[20:34] <patrickz> ugh

[20:34] <patrickz> ok

[20:57] <vrurg> patrickz: what do you do to build dyncall moar submodule 

[20:57] <vrurg> ?

[21:00] <patrickz> Hey

[21:01] <patrickz> Did you try with a space in path?

[21:02] <patrickz> dyncall is currently not able to do that on *nixes. I notified the devs.

[21:02] <patrickz> So only without spaces on linux and mac

[21:02] <patrickz> for now

[21:03] <vrurg> I'm building in "~/tmp/rakudo test" and install into install/ under the path.

[21:04] <patrickz> As I said, no spaces on mac and linux for now :-(

[21:05] <vrurg> All of it doesn't make sense until we get it fixed. :( 

[21:05] <patrickz> It works with spaces on Windows. That's the platform that most dreadfully needs it.

[21:06] <patrickz> I guess that's also the reason why the dyncall devs made it work on windows but not anywhere else.

[21:11] <vrurg> Ok, built relocatable moar in a path without spaces, then renamed directory. That fooled it.

[21:12] <patrickz> Not sure that means it worked or that it didn't... :-P

[21:13] <vrurg> Half-by-half. Broke on including uv.h – because moar config reports the no-spaces path.

[21:13] <vrurg> Fixed with a symlink. 

[21:14] <vrurg> Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /Users/vrurg/tmp/rakudo test/tools/lib/NQP/Config/Rakudo.pm line 347.

[21:15] <patrickz> that'd be nqp::prefix

[21:17] <vrurg> And then lines 362,363 too. moar::ldrpath moar::ldrpath_relocatable

[21:17] <patrickz> did it completely fail to retrieve the nqp config?

[21:19] <vrurg> patrickz: Not sure, but it is likely so. ./install/bin/nqp-m --show-config gives all variables correctly.

[21:22] *** lizmat joined
[21:24] <vrurg> patrickz: I think I found the problem. It somehow reset nqp-configure to the default commit instead of space-in-path branch.

[21:25] <patrickz> vrurg: I added a commit to rakudo and nqp that changes the nqp-configure submodule to point to my clone + latest commit. Did you see that?

[21:26] <vrurg> patrickz: Yes, it did work for nqp but somehow rakudo did not update. Now everything built and installed (a little bit of dancing with tambourine can be ignored for now ;) )

[21:27] <patrickz> whoot!

[21:27] <patrickz> So it's a thumbs up from the mac side?

[21:27] <vrurg> So, just summarizing: works but needs cooperation from dyncall devs.

[21:28] <patrickz> I notify them. They weren't aware of the problem but it doesn't have the highest priority at the moment.

[21:28] <vrurg> patrickz: Confirm. If there any rough edges – we'll polish them later.

[21:29] <vrurg> patrickz: Thanks!

[21:29] <patrickz> OK. Then I'll revert the submodule test commit, rebase on master and merge. Thanks for your help!
