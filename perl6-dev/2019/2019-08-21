[17:10] <vrurg> When a nqp op registered as inlinable â€“ will it always be inlined?

[17:32] *** pamplemousse joined
[18:50] *** robertle joined
[18:53] <MasterDuke> vrurg: i'm pretty far from an expert, but i think the answer is no. it depends on the size of the thing being inlined and the size of the thing it would be inlined into. and other factors i think, but i can't remember them. timotimo or jnthn would probably know best

[18:55] <vrurg> MasterDuke: Thanks! Though so far it seems to be always inlined. It's p6clientctx op which returns client's context and it obviously depends on wether it has its own context or not.

[22:23] <vrurg> Anybody with an idea where to stick registration of new nqp::p6* to make them available for the metamodel?

[22:24] <jnthn> vrurg: I think you need to register them for both nqp and perl6 HLLs

[22:25] <jnthn> Other than that, pretty sure they both go in Ops.nqp

[22:26] <vrurg> jnthn: Ops is platform dependent. I made them in QAST via register_op_desugar. Actions register a lot with it, but those are not accessible by, say, ClassHOW. 

[22:27] <vrurg> Correction: Ops are backend dependant.

[22:28] <jnthn> vrurg: Ah, but I think the answer may well be the same anyway: register them for nqp too

[22:29] <vrurg> Oh, my! Of course! register_op_desugar does it for perl6 only. Thanks!

[22:35] <jnthn> Glad I could help :)

[22:37] <vrurg> Still doesn't work, but this shoud be pure technical issue now. :)

[22:43] <vrurg> greppable6: Perl6::Ops

[22:44] <greppable6> vrurg, Found nothing!

[22:45] <vrurg> What if I rename Perl6::Ops into Perl6::<backend>::Ops and create a common backend-independand Perl6::Ops?

[22:58] <vrurg> Never mind, gen_cat solves it.
