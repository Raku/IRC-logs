[18:32] <nine> Finally! After 2 1/2 months of agonizing over this memory leak issue, I have a fix that passes all tests

[18:35] <jnthn> nine++ # wow, that'd dedication

[18:38] <timotimo> ooooh

[18:40] <nine> I just hope that it doesn't tank performance too much. It involves creating a new reference (also an object) every time I pass an object of a wrapped Perl 5 class to Perl 5 code. And a destructor resurrecting the referenced object when the reference goes away

[18:45] *** moritz joined
[18:46] <timotimo> well, at least i remember the problem :S

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> sooooâ€¦ I still didn't get an answer about this one

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> 6c: say Int < 0

[23:28] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/eaa77b6c023d8f6850956405b48dd214

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> you all are ok with that change?

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> Blin didn't find any module that depended on the previous behavior, so that's good

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> but it's still freaking scary to me :)

[23:29] <AlexDaniel> is my fear unjustified? :)

[23:30] <AlexDaniel> anyone?

[23:50] *** lucasb left
[23:50] <timotimo> well, Int normally behaves as 0 + that warning

[23:50] <timotimo> i'm okay with it
