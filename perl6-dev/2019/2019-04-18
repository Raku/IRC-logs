[00:00] <ugexe> [SCHEDULER 99951] Will not add extra worker; hit 64 thread limit [branch with some total completed]

[00:00] <ugexe> wonder if thats something like $finished.then({ #`(cant spawn a thread to reach here) }); cleanup()

[00:01] <ugexe> quite a few "[SCHEDULER 99951] Heuristic queue progress deadlock situation detected" before that

[00:01] <ugexe> right around when it would slowdown

[00:02] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/5e1576f8cbd6a3db44e834cf9a0489fb

[00:03] <japhb> ugexe: Yeah, something is definitely not being cleaned up.

[00:04] <japhb> ugexe: Would you mind updating (or do you mind if I update) the bug report with your gist?

[00:06] <ugexe> sure, go for it

[00:07] <patrickb> I thought some more about handling command line arguments of subprocesses on Windows. Here is a short writeup of my findings and thoughts so far: https://gist.github.com/patzim/73d4e9c7f0cfc07d2db0f21c82aa1354#file-commandline-processing-md

[00:07] <japhb> MasterDuke: shrinking MAX_THREADS gives ugexe's result faster, but not linearly so; it got maybe 2/3 as far with only 4 threads.

[00:08] <patrickb> ugexe: ^ If you're interested.

[00:08] <patrickb> And with that I'm off for today.

[00:09] <patrickb> o/

[00:14] <japhb> OK, notes from our exploration added to the sync bug.
