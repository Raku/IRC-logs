[00:00] <vrurg> I know. But it's still a mystery to me where the inital Failure comes from.

[00:02] <vrurg> Anyway, that's not the worst problem. I turned on throwing on not found symbols for PseudoStash. It now looks like there about 10-15 places with potential to explode... :(

[00:02] <timotimo> hm, the failure objects do carry a stack trace with them if i'm not mistaken

[00:02] <timotimo> could change the DESTROY method to output more stuff

[00:06] <vrurg> timotimo: I think I didn't analyse it throughly enough, that's it. It's not what worries me the most now.

[00:07] <patrickz> vrurg: Once you find time, I think I need some more help wrt the spaces-in-path on MacOS... But not today...

[00:07] <timotimo> i'll head to bed now

[00:07] <timotimo> o/

[00:08] <vrurg> patrickz: BTW, we had another discussion today on switching away from perl for Configure.

[00:08] <vrurg> timotimo: o/

[00:09] <patrickz> vrurg: My suspicion is the read_config() in nqp that uses stage0 to retrieve moar config vars somehow doesnt work on Mac.

[00:09] <patrickz> vrurg: But anyways, nothing for today...

[00:10] <vrurg> patrickz: Aha. I'm too occupied with pseuso-packages now anyway.

[00:24] * patrickz is off to bed

[02:57] <vrurg> .tell AlexDaniel I think rakudo/rakudo is missing 'CORE' label.

[02:57] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> .

[02:57] <yoleaux> 02:57Z <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I think rakudo/rakudo is missing 'CORE' label.

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: which should mean what?

[02:58] <vrurg> Things broken in or about CORE.setting

[02:58] <vrurg> R#3028 – I didn't find anything approriate.

[02:58] <synopsebot> R#3028 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3028 [6.e] No new symbols could be defined in CORE.<letter>.setting

[02:59] <AlexDaniel> hmm why CORE is spelled as CORE

[02:59] <AlexDaniel> oops I mean stylized

[03:00] <vrurg> Dunno, it was before me. ;)

[03:00] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: added, we will see how it goes

[03:00] <vrurg> Thanks!

[03:00] <vrurg> Time for late dinner and some beer, pehaps.

[03:01] <vrurg> o/

[03:01] <vrurg> Not yet... 

[03:02] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: BTW, the related PR is ready for merge. It changed default behavior of PSEUDO::<NoSymbol> to return Failure. 

[03:02] <vrurg> Might affect some 3rd party modules. So, I think it could be of some interest for you.

[03:02] <AlexDaniel> well, we still didn't get this release out yet…

[03:03] <AlexDaniel> there are two relatively small issues

[03:03] <vrurg> Can I merge into master? Or better wait?

[03:03] <AlexDaniel> you can merge it to master

[03:03] <AlexDaniel> no reason to wait really, there is a release branch

[03:03] <vrurg> problem-solving#47 depends on this PR.

[03:03] <AlexDaniel> so one issue is this: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2019-07-12#l31

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> and it's about simply cherry-picking that commit, but I'm interested in hearing jnthn's opinion on it

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> as we're changing the 6.c-errata tests

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> and the other one is the VERSION file :)

[03:05] <vrurg> Ok, tell me if anything else is needed from my side. 

[03:05] <vrurg> I'm off to help my wife, finally. o/

[03:18] <AlexDaniel> I go to bed now :) maybe tomorrow

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> :)

[22:07] <ugexe> we should just rename VERSION to B33892FBDDEFFC3368077B4904AD0B3D562A7312

[22:18] <timotimo> can we allocate a UUID for this purpose?
