[11:11] <pmurias> is anyone opposed to adding a :filename option to EVAL to support setting the fake filename to something else than EVAL_{some_sequential_number}?

[11:39] <pmurias> jnthn: what do you think about adding an :$filename option to EVAL to support providing a fake filename instead of the autogenerated EVAL_0, EVAL_1 etc.

[19:32] <greppable6> AlexDaniel, Found nothing!

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> sortiz: where did they find that code?

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> I was thinking maybe it's a bug in https://github.com/sergot/openssl and it needs a pull request

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> ahh, they were trying to modify OpenSSL module

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> ok I see

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> or were they?

[19:33] <sortiz> See the ticket, was an ancient report that you tagged

[19:34] <AlexDaniel> closed

[19:34] <sortiz> Thanks!

[22:06] <MasterDuke> .tell pmurias you can use line directives to set the filename in EVALs. e.g., `EVAL "#line 1 made_up_file\nsay q|hi|;die q|so long|;say q|bye|"`

[22:06] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to pmurias.
