[14:00] <nine> And with that, provided that you're running a recent enough rakudo, you'll get all the precomp benefits even if you're loading Perl 5 modules in yours :)

[14:01] <nine> This e.g. reduces the startup time of our newest cro application at work from 12.7s to just 4.5s

[14:06] <nine> Of those 4.5s 1.7s are actually spent waiting for Perl 5 to load its modules btw.
