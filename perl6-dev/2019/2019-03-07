[02:42] <Kaiepi> to make an op return null on the jvm do you make it a void method and make the return type $RT_VOID, make it return the null type object from HLL and make the return type $RT_OBJ, or some other way?

[02:47] <Kaiepi> oh it looks like i need to use $RT_VOID and pass :cont

[08:15] *** Kaiepi joined
[10:04] <Kaiepi> anyone on familiar with the jvm? i'm running into a weird build error with rakudo trying to add a setsockopt op and i can't figure out what's going wrong

[10:05] <Kaiepi> i'll need about 10 minutes to get the exact error

[10:18] <Kaiepi> running 'nqp -e 'nqp::setsockopt(nqp::socket(0), 0, 0)' throws the error i expect it to, so the op itself is working, but when i try to build rakudo it complains about not being able to unbox a type object

[10:18] <Kaiepi> but i don't unbox anything anywhere in my code?

[10:18] *** pmurias joined
[10:18] <pmurias> Kaiepi: what op do you want to add on the js with the thread context?

[10:18] <yoleaux> 5 Mar 2019 22:06Z <MasterDuke> pmurias: you can use line directives to set the filename in EVALs. e.g., `EVAL "#line 1 made_up_file\nsay q|hi|;die q|so long|;say q|bye|"`

[10:19] <timotimo> Kaiepi: does it give the type?

[10:19] <timotimo> it can be that an undefined value is passed to the op in some place that it tries to turn into an int or so

[10:19] <Kaiepi> lemme check

[10:20] <Kaiepi> pmurias i'm adding getsockopts, getsockopt, and setsockopt ops to moar and the jvm

[10:21] <timotimo> in moar i would know to "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)", but no clue how you would do something equivalent on jvm

[10:21] <pmurias> what do you need the ctx for on the js?

[10:21] <pmurias> Kaiepi: but :ctx should add one if you need them

[10:22] <Kaiepi> wdym by the js? the javascript vm?

[10:22] <pmurias> the js backend

[10:22] <Kaiepi> i haven't written anything for the js yet

[10:22] <Kaiepi> can't install it because of issues with a couple dependencies

[10:23] <timotimo> just making sure the js code doesn't break? that's good form

[10:23] <pmurias> Kaiepi: btw. usually if you add nqp level tests I can add ops easily

[10:23] <timotimo> not everybody tests all backends when they change code. i am very guilty of this

[10:24] <Kaiepi> tests for getsockopts/getsockopt/setsockopt would be fairly straightforward to add

[10:24] *** lizmat joined
[10:24] <timotimo> pmurias is responsible for a quite big portion of the nqp tests for all the ops we have

[10:25] <timotimo> from when the JS port was being made

[10:26] <pmurias> I do feel they add value besides helping the JS backend ;)

[10:27] <Kaiepi> ok here's the error https://hastebin.com/segusacafe.sql

[10:27] *** lizmat left
[10:27] <pmurias> but for the JS backend they help a lot to figure out what the op should do and to implement it without mixing rakudo itself into it

[10:28] <pmurias> jnthn: I checked EVALFILE and it just uses EVAL_* so if we added a filename it could use it too

[10:28] <timotimo> i agree they do

[10:31] <Kaiepi> did i write this part of the setsockopt op right? https://hastebin.com/asoboyumak.rb

[15:09] <timotimo> class specification sounds a little strange

[15:09] <timotimo> perhaps decllaration is more commonly used?

[15:14] <timotimo> doh i opened the file itself in tree "mode" to hopefully be able to click the commit shas

[15:14] <timotimo> but no

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> yeah that's annoying

[15:17] <timotimo> looks like that parameterization in parents is mentioned again in the next section

[15:19] <lucasb> so, on a non-existent path, IO::Path.dir was made to throw rather than return a Failure. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2650

[15:19] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: not seeing it, where's that?

[15:19] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: also feel free to fix it

[15:20] <lucasb> should this have some symmetry with IO::Path.slurp which returns a Failure, rather than throw?

[15:21] <lucasb> I mean, 'nonexitent'.IO.dir throws and 'nonexitent'.IO.slurp returns a failure

[15:21] <timotimo> i've read through it once now
