[15:13] <lizmat> grrr.... did I mention I hate git branches?

[15:14] * moritz likes them

[15:14] <lizmat> To ssh://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git

[15:14] <lizmat>  ! [rejected]            new-sprintf -> new-sprintf (non-fast-forward)

[15:14] <lizmat> error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git'

[15:14] <lizmat> hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind

[15:14] <lizmat> hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.

[15:14] <lizmat> hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

[15:14] <lizmat> hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

[15:15] <lizmat> and when I do a "git pull", I get a file full of conflicts

[15:15] <lizmat> I don't understand what I'm doing wrong  :-(

[15:19] *** Kaypie is now known as Kaiepi

[15:19] <Kaiepi> are builds intended to be possible to do with bsd make?

[15:20] *** cognominal joined
[15:27] <Kaiepi> i've always used bsd mae up until some recent changes that are incompatible with it, but i always interpreted the build script telling you to use gmake instead as it just outputting the wrong thing

[15:31] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> lizmat: If you git pull and there are conflicts on a file you didn't modify, you can git checkout <branch> -- <file> and continue your merge commit.

[15:32] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> If you did modify the file, unfortunately, ya gotta do the git conflict shuffle.

[15:32] <lizmat> discord6: it was trying to merge an older version of the file in the branch with the current state

[15:32] <lizmat> it was *really* confused

[15:33] <lizmat> I nuked the branch locally and on github

[15:33] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> ;_;

[15:33] <masak> lizmat: long story short -- `git pull` is only a correct operation on a branch that is "append-only"

[15:33] <lizmat> and *that* is what created the conflicts when it shouldn't have

[15:33] <masak> lizmat: chances are you'll want to `git fetch; git reset --hard origin/<branch>`

[15:34] <lizmat> I nuked the branch and set up a new one

[15:34] <masak> works too, I guess. same effect

[15:34] <lizmat> lost a bit of history

[15:34] <masak> lizmat: IMO, `git pull` is dangerous because it's always there and only sometimes correct

[15:35] <masak> lizmat: if you had done what I suggested, the history would've been in the reflog :) now, I don't know

[15:35] <lizmat> honestly, I don't care anymore

[15:35] <masak> lizmat: might still be in `git reflog HEAD`

[15:35] <lizmat> it's somehow related to having started the branch before some submodule changes

[15:35] <lizmat> I didn't lose any code

[15:36] <masak> ok

[15:36] <lizmat> I copied the files and used them to start a new branch (with a different name to be sure)

[15:47] <Geth> ¦ roast/new-sprintf: Fix up all %x tests

[15:47] <Geth> ¦ roast/new-sprintf: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/1d409c271c

[15:48] <lizmat> Possibly a "problem solving" question:

[15:49] <lizmat> the "%#o" format, only puts a "0" in front of the value

[15:49] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf("%#o",15)

[15:49] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar ef2ee7912: OUTPUT: «"017"␤»

[15:49] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf("%o",15)

[15:49] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar ef2ee7912: OUTPUT: «"17"␤»

[15:50] <lizmat> now, in Perl 6 that does *not* roundtrip

[15:50] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf("%#o",15).EVAL

[15:50] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar ef2ee7912: OUTPUT: «Potential difficulties:␤    Leading 0 has no meaning. If you meant to create an octal numb…»

[15:50] <evalable6> lizmat, Full output: https://gist.github.com/3c03d7354ffb544ab997dc01deb82788

[15:51] <lizmat> so I was thinking of using the "%O" format to create a Perl 6 compatible string

[15:51] <lizmat> m: dd sprintf("%#O",15)    # should then become 0o17

[15:51] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar ef2ee7912: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) Directive #O is not valid in sprintf format sequence %#O␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/zh8eKt2LCV line 1␤␤»

[15:52] <lizmat> and since we don't support that atm, there should not be any problems
