[15:15] <bartolin> in src/core/Buf.pm6 there are a few calls to nqp::getattr for a Range object that don't nqp::decont that object: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/adba017f794107d938d644883609b0a5cfa52b8e/src/core/Buf.pm6#L387

[15:15] <bartolin> that doesn't work on the jvm backend (java.lang.RuntimeException: No such attribute '$!is-int' for this object)

[15:16] <timotimo> good catch

[15:16] <timotimo> i think oftentimes there'd be a variable that holds a deconted version of some object, but i'm not sure if that's still good for performance or if putting deconts everywhere is more efficient or something

[15:16] <bartolin> so, there should be a nqp::decont, right? (like here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/adba017f794107d938d644883609b0a5cfa52b8e/src/core/Range.pm6#L693)

[15:17] * bartolin wonders what would be more efficient, too.

[15:17] <timotimo> probably depends entirely upon how spesh deals with it

[15:17] <timotimo> and the jit fater spesh, too

[15:19] <bartolin> in this particular cases it would need five additional calls to nqp::decont. I'm reluctant to add those. (it would make the code work on the JVM backend, though :)

[17:06] <lizmat> bartolin: please add the deconts

[17:07] <lizmat> even more generally: if you find something doesn't work on the JVM backend because of a missing decont. please add it

[17:42] <bartolin> thanks, will do.

[17:44] *** lucasb joined
[17:44] <bartolin> I've also just found a missing (from the perspective of the JVM backend) null check for %!hash in src/core/Capture.pm6: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/adba017f794107d938d644883609b0a5cfa52b8e/src/core/Capture.pm6#L37 I think I'll add that, too. (We have similiar checks for null or definedness in that area of code.)

[17:44] <bartolin> . o O ( there is always git revert )
