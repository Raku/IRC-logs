[14:41] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/098de1bf9d93e280414b7db69bec06a2

[14:42] <lizmat> since I'm the only person working on that branch, how can they have diverged?

[14:43] <robertle> are the "other" changes till remote? and rebase tries to rebase onto the local version of master?

[14:43] <timotimo> lizmat: didn't you rebase your branch recently?

[14:43] <lizmat> I nuked the branch and started a new one

[14:43] <timotimo> ah

[14:43] <timotimo> well

[14:44] <timotimo> everything pre-nuke is now in origin/newer-sprintf and "you don't have them"

[14:44] <lizmat> oddly enough, this time a "git pull" did no harm

[14:44] <timotimo> and everything post-nuke is in your branch and "origin does not have them"

[14:44] <lizmat> $ git pull

[14:44] <lizmat> Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

[14:44] <timotimo> if i want to see how commits relate to one another, i use "git lg" which is an alias to

[14:44] <timotimo> git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %Cblue<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative

[14:44] <lizmat> origin does have all of the changes (if by origin you mean Github)

[14:45] <timotimo> with --all it gives you other branches in addition to the one you have checked out

[14:45] *** anatofuz joined
[14:45] <timotimo> oh, when you did "git rebase master", that just means your newer-sprintf branch was already based on the latest master

[14:45] <timotimo> nothing related to origin/newer-sprintf

[14:49] *** anatofuz left
[14:49] <lizmat> in any case, it appears to be ok again now

[14:50] <timotimo> well, you nuked the branch locally, but apparently the branch has already gone to github before the nuke under the same name?

[16:33] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: the message from git makes sense to me. So there are some commits on origin (on the same branch) and some different commits locally

[16:34] <AlexDaniel> and it has nothing to do with `master`

[16:50] <masak> a branch has diverged with its remote branch either when (a) another team member pushed something first, or (b) you've rebased locally and haven't force-pushed yet

[16:50] <masak> Git doesn't really distinguish between those two situations, which is a bit of a pity

[16:50] <masak> (but also very Git)

[16:51] <timotimo>  so it's a gity?
