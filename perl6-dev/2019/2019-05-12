[03:20] <MasterDuke> i'm getting a lot of one-off failures in spectests. i can never get the tests to fail again when run in a loop. i suspect some sort of moarvm problem that's randomly manifesting itself

[03:20] <MasterDuke> anyone else seeing anything similar?

[03:23] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i've seen failures in t/spec/S06-traits/misc.t, t/spec/S29-context/die.t, and t/spec/S05-modifier/ignorecase.t, 

[03:44] <MasterDuke> also t/spec/S17-supply/batch.t

[12:34] <gfldex> should an LTA for "STable conflict detected during deserialization." go to NQP or Rakudo?

[12:44] <timotimo> i think the error occurs inside of moarvm; if any more info should be made available, it'd have to come from C code and be "improved" upon in nqp or rakudo

[12:47] <gfldex> It would be nice to list the modules that have been loaded so far when the error occurs.

[12:48] <timotimo> ah, that could be done in nqp i'd think

[14:59] <jnthn> dogbert17: Correct, I think; you'd have to stick lazy in for that

[16:38] <bartolin> if noone objects, I'll merge https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/442 soon-ish (which requires at least Java 9). Afterwards, I'll add the above workaround. I'm still waiting for a running spectest (with Java 11) to complete, but it looks good so far.

[16:41] <bartolin> I wonder if we should just require Java 11. (I doubt someone will use Rakudo or NQP with Java 9 or 10, since they have already reached end of support. I will only test with Java 11.)

[17:25] <MasterDuke> bartolin: +1 on bumping to java 11
