[00:15] <vrurg> Where can I find info on how natives are handled internally? Trying to trace down a bug with uint and can't trace things down to MoarVM functions.

[00:48] <MasterDuke> vrurg: a lot of the uint functionality is currently handled by the int functions (part of the reason for a lot of the uint bugs)

[00:49] <MasterDuke> but what do you mean by handled? 

[00:49] <vrurg> MasterDuke: I mean pretty much everything. Any info would be useful. 

[00:51] <vrurg> In particular, I'm trying to find out why assigning a value with signature bit set (like 128) to uint results in the same value – but negative (-128). For now can't even determine wether it happens upon assignment or upon reading.

[00:51] <MasterDuke> well, any of the nqp::*_(i|n|s) ops operate on natives

[00:52] <vrurg> But none of them are involved in this case. R#2354 – it's about attrref

[00:53] <MasterDuke> i believe in that case it's kind of both. i.e., 64bits are being passed around, if you interpret them an unsigned you get one value, if you interpret them as signed (which most moarvm functions do) you get a different value

[00:54] <MasterDuke> i had a branch in moarvm where i tried to add uint support to a bunch of stuff, but it was a while ago and i got over my head

[00:54] <MasterDuke> let me see if i can find it, its commits should show you some of the relevant places to look

[00:56] <vrurg> MasterDuke: thanks! Might be helpful. Though if it requires some major overhaul of MoarVM – I'd better pass it over to somebody else. I'm not ready for this level yet.

[00:57] <MasterDuke> hm, https://github.com/MasterDuke17/MoarVM/commits/add_unsigned_int_ops_where_missing is the only thing i found that seems immediately relevant, but i thought i had done more. oh well, maybe not...

[00:59] <vrurg> Ok, new ops are needed, as I see from your commits...

[01:00] <MasterDuke> well, i wouldn't take my work there as gospel truth

[01:00] <vrurg> I have to go now. Will check it out more close tomorrow.

[01:00] <MasterDuke> good luck

[01:01] <vrurg> MasterDuke: I just think you were right. I don't see how _i can handle unsigneds correctly.

[01:01] <vrurg> MasterDuke: thanks!

[14:25] <pmurias> the trailing ' was a typo 

[14:25] <lizmat> there was a trailing ' in pmurias' code

[14:26] <lizmat> http://news.perlfoundation.org/2019/03/february-report-of-the-perl-6-.html

[14:26] <jnthn> It's possible, given we have spesh and the like, that the optimization in question is no longer very valurable

[14:27] <lizmat> pmurias: indeed, they're just both doing the Rational role

[14:29] <pmurias> jnthn: other thing is that we have a bunch of nqp lowlevel objects that are special cased during serialization, should all backends forcing serialization of them as regular objects (by putting them into a serialization context)

[14:53] <pmurias> if we duplicate code I would add both a multi with Rat and a multi with Rational, which would duplicate a fair bit of lines

[14:57] <lizmat> pmurias: or put that in a role that could be mixd in ?

[14:59] <jnthn> Can it not go in Rational? (disclaimer: didn't look at the code :))

[15:17] <jnthn> Hm, no, it's same-ish on HEAD without the branches. Hmm.

[15:17] <jnthn> I'm sure it used to be better

[15:21] <lizmat> class ListFailure is Failure does Iterable { method iterator { self.exception.throw }  }   # interesting idea by leont

[15:21] <lizmat> to be returned by those cases where an Iterable is returned, and we want to return a Failure

[15:22] <lizmat> #2650

[15:22] <jnthn> Is doing that to iterator in Failure problematic?

[15:22] <lizmat> yes

[15:22] <jnthn> OK, why?

[15:22] <lizmat> hmm... maybe I misunderstood the question, could you rephrase ?

[15:23] <jnthn> m: sub foo() { fail "bar" }; dd foo().iterator

[15:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar c9110654b: OUTPUT: «Rakudo::Iterator::ReifiedListIterator.new␤»

[15:24] <jnthn> If Failure got the method iterator that is proposed for ListFailure, does it break spectests? Ecosystem?

[15:24] <lizmat> ah... ok,. interesting... lemme check

[15:32] <pmurias> lizmat: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Rat.pm6#L331 - the multi signature uses Rational while the method body has a nqp::getattr with Rat

[15:33] <pmurias> jnthn: the copy & pasted & modified code could go into Rational

[15:34] <jnthn> Oh, that should just be using the accessors

[15:34] <jnthn> If it's going to constrain on Rational

[15:34] <jnthn> Not getattr etc.

[15:35] <lizmat> the initial idea about that was to make them faster

[15:35] <jnthn> Yeah but it also makes them wronger

[15:35] <lizmat> but using accessors now wouldn't make that much difference, would it ?

[15:35] <jnthn> No

[15:35] <jnthn> They'll be inlined

[15:35] <lizmat> ok, cool...

[15:36] <pmurias> lizmat: I'll handle that ;)

[15:36] <jnthn> I just merged some opts I'd been holding back until post-release, anyways

[15:38] <lizmat> jnthn: re adding Failure.iterator: minor  breakage in S03-operators/minmax related to Failure vs thrown exception

[15:38] <lizmat> jnthn: so that seems a sensible solution 

[15:40] <jnthn> Does it fix the issue being discussed? :)

[15:41] <lizmat> m: dd Failure.new.min

[15:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar c9110654b: OUTPUT: «Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "Failed"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)␤»

[15:41] <lizmat> with the new code, that throws

[15:41] <lizmat> $ 6 'dd Failure.new.min'

[15:41] <lizmat> Failed

[15:41] <lizmat> so yes, I think it solves the issue being discussed

[15:42] <jnthn> Hm, maybe throwing in .iterator is too eager, and we should be returning self there, so that it's the .pull-one that fails

[15:42] <jnthn> uh, throws

[15:42] <jnthn> Or something along those lines

[15:42] <jnthn> Seems we can find a solution that doesn't make us introduce another new type, though.

[15:43] <lizmat> but then it would throw because there is no Failure.pull-one ?

[15:44] <jnthn> Hmm, yeah

[15:46] <lizmat> hmm...  seems to work just fine

[15:46] <lizmat> I guess the FALLBACK ?

[15:46] <jnthn> Perhaps

[15:46] <lizmat> yeah, looks like

[19:06] <bartolin> in the past I've tried to keep 'make spectest' on the jvm backend as clean as possible. For (new) test failures, that I wasn't able to fix, I added backend specific fudges to roast -- generating a lot of noise. As far as I understood Zoffix++ wasn't keen on all those commits. Do you have (strong?) opinions about such fudges?

[22:47] <jnthn> bartolin: I've no objections to fudges going in to roast, fwiw

[23:18] <leont> Failures do the weirdest things

[23:19] <leont> m: use Test; my @foo = (Failure.new("")); @foo[0]; try { @foo[0] }; dd $1;

[23:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 23fca8f6f: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[23:19] <leont> m: use Test; my @foo = (Failure.new("")); @foo[0]; try { @foo[0] }; dd $!;

[23:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 23fca8f6f: OUTPUT: «X::AdHoc $! = X::AdHoc.new(payload => "")␤»

[23:20] <leont> @foo[0] is fine outside the try, but throws inside of it???

[23:22] <leont> I can't explain this

[23:26] <jnthn> Side point: the parens around the Failure don't change anything

[23:27] <jnthn> But the answer is that `use fatal` is in effect inside of a try

[23:28] <jnthn> try { foo } is really like { use fatal; CATCH { default { $! = $_ } }; foo }()

[23:32] <leont> I see

[23:33] <leont> That does explain why lives-ok fails when throws-ok also fails.

[23:34] <leont> (on the same coderef)

[23:40] <leont> I'm not entirely sure which behavior is desirable, but I'm pretty sure consistency is
