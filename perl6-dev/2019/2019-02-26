[01:19] <MasterDuke> some of the "Issues" are actual problems, some are wishes/idea/todos

[01:26] <timotimo> mhm

[01:37] <timotimo> the bug i just found is clearly not a blocker, but damn ...

[01:37] <timotimo> would it be nice to not have that bug for another release :)

[02:22] <MasterDuke> why does Geth report twice for moarvm and rakudo commits, but not nqp?

[02:27] <AlexDaniel> it likes rakudo commits

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> but hey, a few days ago it selectively didn't report some of the commits

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> so twice is not an issue, just a slight overcorrection :)

[02:38] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: no, Gumbo is still not ok

[02:40] <AlexDaniel> it feels like you need more iterations until you get a moar panic, but I'm not 100% sure about that

[03:38] <MasterDuke> timotimo, et al.: if i'm working with binary (or not) data, is there any reason to use Buf vs buf8?

[20:54] *** samcv_ is now known as samcv

[20:54] <dogbert17> my 'zef is the culprit theory' was thoroughly busted by ugexe++

[20:55] <dogbert17> however I noticed something

[20:55] <dogbert17> when doing som of my tests I had cloned the Red repo from github, perhaps you did the same when doing manual tests

[20:56] <dogbert17> anyway, whats downloaded by zef and what's on github doesn't match !

[20:56] <japhb> dogbert17: And not just a matter of an out of date zef cache?

[20:57] <dogbert17> one file which differs is 06-better-map.t

[20:57] <dogbert17> japhb, I removed that repo from the cache rather forcefully :)

[20:57] <dogbert17> and reinstalled

[20:57] <japhb> (I find I have to blow away the zef cache sometimes to get zef to re-download something it thinks is already current, but isn't.)

[20:58] <japhb> hmmm.

[20:58] <japhb> So what was ugexe's explanation of why zef download and github don't match?  Is it a CPAN module that hasn't been pushed recently?

[20:58] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel, japhb; check this: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/6aee1012e1b000c2cdeb7b538d247aba

[20:59] <japhb> Ayup, out of date tarball

[21:00] <dogbert17> so what's the proper way to blow away the zef cache then?

[21:01] <japhb> I don't think that's zef's fault.  I think it's that the owner has pushed their git repo to github, but not packaged it into a tarball and CPAN uploaded it yet.  (Or it hasn't been distributed in the CPAN network yet.)

[21:02] <japhb> I think Perl 5 folk are used to remembering that if a new version isn't distributed on CPAN yet, it might as well not exist.  But I think Perl 6 folk are less so.

[21:04] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: it's released on CPAN, so no way

[21:04] <japhb> (And to answer your direct question, `zef nuke` is the command you want.

[21:04] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: but you can `zef install https://github.com/FCO/Red.git`

[21:05] <dogbert17> you're probably correct. Cloning the repo and then using 'zef install .' works for me

[21:05] <japhb> Right, to be clear, the zef cache isn't at fault for this case, but if it ever *is* the problem, then use `zef nuke` to blow away the cache entirely.

[21:05] <dogbert17> japhb: thx

[21:06] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel: the stuff downloaded by zef is not the same as what can be found on https://github.com/FCO/Red

[21:07] * dogbert17 unless perhaps I'm using an out of date zef

[21:09] <dogbert17> dogbert@dogbert-VirtualBox ~/repos/Red $ zef --version

[21:09] <dogbert17> Version detection requires rakudo v2019.01 or newer

[21:09] <AlexDaniel> yeah that's an interesting message

[21:09] <dogbert17> hmm

[21:09] <japhb> Ummm ....

[21:09] <AlexDaniel> I noticed it when it was committed, shrugged and moved on

[21:09] <AlexDaniel> at the time 2019.01 was still planned

[21:10] <dogbert17> so, what to do about the module?

[21:10] <japhb> You say the GH version works fine?

[21:11] <patrickb> vrurg: I'd be grateful if you could do another build and make install and then send me the output of `otool -l moar` and `otool -l libmoar.dylib`. 

[21:11] <dogbert17> it installs for me without any errors

[21:11] <japhb> If so, ask the module author to bump version and upload a new package to CPAN

[21:11] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: try a couple of times maybe?

[21:11] <dogbert17> sure

[21:12] <AlexDaniel> uh but why should the old version moar panic anyway

[21:13] <dogbert17> now that's a good question. it shouldn't fail like that ofc

[21:13] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: is there a backtrace anywhere?

[21:13] <dogbert17> I can get one

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> if there's something going on in DBIish then I'm unlikely to have any interest in having that fixed asap

[21:14] <japhb> It might help to determine the git rev that the broken CPAN tarball was made from, for more direct/reliable testing.

[21:15] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: oh right! You can bisect the Red module!

[21:15] <japhb> Anyone know if Red will be converting over to DB::* any time soon?
