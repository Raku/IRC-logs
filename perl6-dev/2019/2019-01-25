[15:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[15:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Previously, if the exception lacked a `message` method, then it would

[15:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: blow up with a method not found error when trying to display the

[15:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: this could happen at pretty much any point in the program. Make it

[15:22] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: robust in the face of a missing `message` method in the exception.
