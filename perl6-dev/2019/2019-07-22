[10:41] <kawaii> any word from the star team about their next release?

[11:55] <nine> Looks like there's a segfault in threaded code using assign meta ops in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Rakudo/Internals.pm6#L1688

[11:55] <nine> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Rakudo/Internals.pm6#L1660 could use some protection from concurrent access

[11:58] <timotimo> oh snap

[11:58] <timotimo> perhaps atomic ops would be good here

[11:59] <timotimo> since atomic ops excell when contention is very low, i think?

[12:01] <nine> Shouldn't the bind to $METAOP_ASSIGN be atomic already? Then all it'd need would be some temporary variable in INSTALL-CORE-METAOPS for setting up and do the bind in the last step

[12:02] <timotimo> perhaps that'd be enough

[12:15] <nine> It's hard to say with such things if it's really fixed, but at least the likelyhood is greatly reduced

[12:16] <timotimo> is the point release already done? %)

[12:16] <timotimo> i don't think it is. this fix should perhaps go in as well :)

[12:38] <lizmat> re 60cfbb39e9  I wonder why that isn't done at compile time 

[12:42] <lizmat> ah, the comment above it explains why:

[12:42] <lizmat>     # Method for lazily installing fast versions of METAOP_ASSIGN ops for

[12:42] <lizmat>     # core infix ops.  Since the compilation of &[op] happens at build time

[12:42] <lizmat>     # of the setting, we're sure we're referring to the core ops and not one

[12:42] <lizmat>     # that has been locally installed.  Called by METAOP_ASSIGN.  Please add

[12:42] <lizmat>     # any other core ops that seem to be necessary.

[13:05] <lizmat> I was wondering why "make spectest" was doing so well the past days, and it turns out that somehow, Inline::Perl5 is not tested anymore

[13:34] <lizmat> hmmm... looking at Changelog: ReifiedListIterator is now a PredictiveIterator [9107215]

[13:34] <lizmat> that one got reverted

[13:42] <nine> *sigh* still more packaging issues with rakudo 2019.07:

[13:42] <nine> [   49s] + perl6 /usr/share/perl6/bin/install-perl6-dist --to=/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/perl6-OO-Monitors-1.1-1.130.x86_64/usr/share/perl6/vendor --for=vendor --from=.

[13:42] <nine> [   49s] Unhandled exception: While looking for 'ModuleLoader.moarvm': no such file or directory

[13:42] <nine> [   49s]    at <unknown>:1  (/usr/share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)

[13:43] <nine> patrickb: looks like a relocatability issue ^^^

[13:45] <patrickb> nine: I'll have time in the evening to look deeper. Which perl6 executable does this use? The installed one or the one in the build dir?

[13:45] <nine> The installed one

[13:45] <nine> From this package: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:perl6/rakudo

[13:47] <nine> nine@sunshine:~> /usr/bin/perl6 -e ''

[13:47] <nine> Unhandled exception: While looking for 'ModuleLoader.moarvm': no such file or directory

[13:47] <patrickb> Is the install-perl6-dist script available somewhere?

[13:48] <patrickb> Ah! Unrelated to anything else there!

[13:48] <patrickb> This is a normal build installed to /usr and that's it?

[13:49] <nine> The file is /usr/share/perl6/lib/Perl6/ModuleLoader.moarvm but rakudo looks for it in /usr/share/nqp/lib/ModuleLoader.moarvm, /usr/share/perl6/lib/ModuleLoader.moarvm, /usr/share/perl6/runtime/ModuleLoader.moarvm and ModuleLoader.moarvm (!)

[13:49] <nine> patrickb: the spec file tells the story: https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/devel:languages:perl6/rakudo/rakudo.spec?expand=1

[13:49] <nine> In essence, it's perl Configure.pl --prefix=/usr && make && make install

[13:53] <lizmat> reportable6: 2019-07-15T00:00:00 2019-07-22T00:00:00Z

[13:53] <reportable6> lizmat, OK, working on it! This may take up to 40 seconds

[13:54] <reportable6> lizmat, https://gist.github.com/3471b932ac770917e5e3103b3fbff11d

[14:03] <patrickb> nine: Thanks for the info. I'll see what I can do.

[14:17] <patrickb> nine: Are you sure it's missing the Perl 6 module loader and not the NQP one?

[14:18] <patrickb> I think the problem actually is, that the nqp build installed the build files into /usr/lib64 instead of into /usr/share/nqp/lib

[14:19] <patrickb> That's where the rakudo build expects the files.

[14:19] <patrickb> Do you know how the files ended up in /usr/lib64/nqp?

[14:21] <lizmat> notable6: weekly reset

[14:21] <notable6> lizmat, Moved existing notes to “weekly_2019-07-22T14:21:03Z”

[14:28] <patrickb> nine: I think it's the --libdir option passed to the NQP build.

[14:48] <nine> patrickb: checking...

[14:50] <patrickb> nine: I seem to recall we talked about this effect of SuSE putting stuff in different folders some time ago.

[14:51] <patrickb> nine: https://gist.github.com/patzim/710baab43da6e8f127df563b5b81c923#problems-with-this-approach

[14:53] <nine> patrickb: yep, removing --libdir seems to fix the issue

[14:54] <nine> Or rather work around it. An option that leads to broken software when used is clearly still an issue that needs a real fix

[14:55] <patrickb> nine: We did talk about this specific problem. I'm not entirely sure anymore what the result was. Whether we said we don't want to support separate lib dirs or thought of a soution? I'll see if I can find the conversation again...

[16:43] <patrickb> nine: I think there is some more conceptual work necessary to solve the problem of distros sometimes changing the directory layout of the installation.

[16:45] <patrickb> The way it currently is, rakudo and nqp provide no means to have a different directory layout in PERL6_HOME (currently placed into share/perl6) or NQP_HOME (currently placed into share/nqp). Those folders could be put somewhere else though.

[16:47] <patrickb> The most important question in that regard: Is the general idea of a single folder where all stuff NQP and all stuff perl6 is in fitting or not?

[16:48] <patrickb> If that design decision turns out to be bad, it's back to the drawing board...

[17:53] <Kaiepi> are pullreqs that could possibly break stuff going to have to wait for 2019.07.1 before they can be merged?

[17:56] <Kaiepi> perfect i can get underway with my grant finally

[17:56] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: we just got another interesting commit in moarvm

[17:56] <timotimo> in a PR

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> this one? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1148

[17:58] <timotimo> yep

[17:58] <timotimo> without it, the debug server cannot be used on windows

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> looks harmless to me

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> .oO( as long as you ifdef stuff to _WIN32, you can do whatever you want :D )

[17:59] <timotimo> i barely know how WSAStartup exactly works, but it's safe to call multiple times, so that's good

[17:59] <timotimo> and libuv calls it like that, too

[18:00] <AlexDaniel> added it to the list

[18:00] <AlexDaniel> thanks

[18:01] <Kaiepi> can someone take a look at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3008, https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/558, and https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1126 ?

[18:01] <Kaiepi> may or may not be worth including in the 2019.07.1 since it fixes ipv6 IO::Socket::INET sockets on freebsd

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> that I'm not that comfortable with

[18:03] <AlexDaniel> can be merged now but it will only be part of 2019.09 I'm afraid

[18:03] <Kaiepi> aight

[18:09] <ugexe> does our SyncSocket do that?

[18:09] <ugexe> since that doesn't use libuv it wouldnt have the WSAStartup thing

[18:10] <ugexe> also i think doing this breaks when booting to windows safe mode?

[18:10] <ugexe> or windows with no network support or whatever

[18:11] <ugexe> (im recalling that from libuv somewhere...)

[18:13] <ugexe> Kaiepi: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/af31d01492b2714a56a9b86943e8aeb9711ee019

[18:13] <ugexe> might be worth checking to see if we need something like that too

[18:15] <Kaiepi> i'll check if it is needed after the next thing i plan on doing for my grant

[18:16] <ugexe> Kaiepi: oops you weren't the one who did https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/1148

[18:17] <Kaiepi> oh

[18:19] <Kaiepi> next thing i plan on doing is making it so moarvm tracks whether or not ipv6 actually works so resolving hostnames with AF_UNSPEC doesn't panic if the first result is ipv6 on systems where it's enabled but misconfigured
