[10:39] <lizmat> why am I getting a "Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '140.82.113.4' to the list of known hosts." on a git pull just now ?

[10:40] <lizmat> is it because of rba's work ?

[10:43] <rba> lizmat: Hmm. No changes from my side on the github.

[10:44] <lizmat> IP number seems to belong to Github, so I guess it's ok

[13:41] <[Coke]> MoarVM panic: Unable to initialize event loop - got this in a perl6-doc checkout running one of the tests. built a brand new perl6, installed it... same panic error.

[13:43] <[Coke]> ... must have been something weird in that shell. weird.

[13:43] <timotimo> it works again?

[13:45] <[Coke]> might have been impacted by a very low ulimit (was testing the bind-stdin issue in that same shell, I think)

[13:46] <timotimo> possible, it does require opening file descriptors

[13:47] <[Coke]> yup. "ulimit -n 10; perl6" causes a panic. (11 is fine)

[13:55] *** AlexDaniel left
[13:56] <[Coke]> ... at least I have an updated perl6 again. :)

[13:57] <timotimo> yay

[21:41] <timotimo> another good option for this would be to introduce a private method that gets called with only the name of the action performed

[21:42] <timotimo> because the bytecode generated to construct the exception and throw it is long-ish
