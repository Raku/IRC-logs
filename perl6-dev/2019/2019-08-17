[11:32] <AlexDaniel> lizmat++

[11:33] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I didn't expect github to bring all the comments into the PR…

[11:34] <lizmat> yeah, it gets a bit confusing, but I'm actually glad it did

[11:35] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: well, uh… I minimized all of them, pretty much, because it was several discussions about changes that you did afterwards

[11:36] <AlexDaniel> e.g. people discussing what will happen to camelia logo before you changed the document saying that camelia won't be changed

[11:36] <AlexDaniel> but you can always hit `unhide` :)

[13:04] <kawaii> TIL: camelia is an existing trademark

[13:11] <moritz> there are women's hygiene products in Germany with that brand name or trademark

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> it's a bit more complicated sometimes

[20:07] <AlexDaniel> like it's unlikely you'll be allowed to sell “Apple” sex toys

[20:12] <discord6> <Aearnus> the "aliases" link on https://docs.perl6.org/routine/MAIN is broken

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> file a bug report!

[20:13] <AlexDaniel> or fix it :)

[20:13] <discord6> <Aearnus> where's the repo for the docs?

[20:14] <discord6> <Aearnus> aha, found it

[20:18] <chloekek> https://github.com/perl6/doc

[20:19] <tobs> it's also in the footer of every page on docs.perl6.org ;)
