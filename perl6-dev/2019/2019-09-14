[22:11] <japhb> [Tux]: Is that on a loaded system?  test-t looks kinda slow

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> weekly: mozilla trying out other chat systems (something that's *maybe* interesting to us too): https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-trial-servers-feedback/44871 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20945551

[23:49] <japhb> AlexDaniel: read through the various Mozilla chat threads.  Matrix caught my eye there -- sounds like you can connect into it using a relatively simple baseline protocol, so it should be reasonable to make a native Perl 6 client/bot library for it.

[23:51] <japhb> In one of the threads someone demonstrated a Bash client for it, so it can't be too hard to do the minimum.  :p-)

[23:51] <japhb> :-)
