[09:19] <nine> How can the exception thrown and handled in this line end up getting serialized?? next if try ::($package) ~~ Inline::Perl5::Extension;

[09:19] <nine> The exception is a X::NoSuchSymbol

[10:44] <nine> My only guess is that the exception is put into $! which then may even be part of a closure.

[10:45] <nine> Anyway, replacing the try with { my $symbol = ::($package); next if $symbol.isa(Failure) or $symbol isa(Inline::Perl5::Extension); } got me past that :)

[10:48] <nine> And to actually handle the Failure: { my $symbol = ::($package); $symbol.Bool; next if $symbol.isa(Failure) or $symbol isa(Inline::Perl5::Extension); }

[21:42] <lizmat> so, is this Geth barfage a github issue or is there something else going on?

[21:46] <timotimo> github issue :)

[21:46] <lizmat> *phew*

[21:46] <timotimo> also, i need to figure out what the empty string at the end means

[21:47] * lizmat doesn't see an empty string at the end

[21:47] <lizmat> but I guess that could be a client thing

[21:47] <timotimo> er

[21:47] <timotimo> at the beginning

[21:48] <lizmat> .oO( left / right, it's all relative :-)
