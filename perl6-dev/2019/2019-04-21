[19:28] <AlexDaniel> what's going on xD

[19:29] <AlexDaniel> where's perl6.org

[19:30] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: seems that there was a hardware outage on Friday

[19:30] <kawaii> due to it being Easter, nothing can be done until Tuesday

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> awesome

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> actually needed docs.perl6.org real quick during some w√∂rk

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> and had to REMEMBER how to write perl6 code

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> can you imagine that

[19:43] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: http://docs.perl6.wakelift.de/
