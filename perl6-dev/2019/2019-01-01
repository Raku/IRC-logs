[14:16] <jnthn> gfldex: The array `my int @a` will be storing things natively; the thing you're observing is that .WHAT is an object operation, but a native int isn't an object, so it has to be auto-boxed into an Int in order to apply .WHAT.

[22:36] <pmurias> lizmat: any thoughts on testing tests also in precompiled mode?

[22:36] <pmurias> found a new precomp only bug :(

[22:37] <lizmat> pmurias: I would welcome that  :-)

[22:39] <pmurias> ok, I'll do that tommorow, I think wrapping stuff in .pm6 (except the use libs) and using it should work
