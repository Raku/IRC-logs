[11:57] <lizmat> yeah, was thinking about that..

[11:58] <timotimo> why not "offbYoNecAmelcAse"?

[11:59] <jnthn> I think exclude isn't really clear what it's excluding it from. I'd probably just have a :multi-invocant that defaults to true and if you want to make it off you'd :!multi-invocant, which reads rather more nicely

[12:02] <lizmat> tImotImo: not sure what you mean :-)

[12:02] <timotimo> to make it more natural to people coming from other programming languages, maybe we can find out what "double semicolon" means in hebrew

[12:02] <lucasb> haha, the PHP meme

[18:10] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, Bisecting by output (old=2018.12 new=d6b1bd2) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[18:13] <patrickb> I think I need to do some path handling in NQP (dirname, add, ...). Is there any documentation on what is available in NQP?

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: have you seen https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown#-inputoutput-opcodes ?

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> that's not exactly what you're asking though :)

[18:14] <patrickb> But might be a start. Thanks!

[18:17] <AlexDaniel> cfa: so it's jnthn's work for sure, but I'm a bit surprised that the whole module bisected to 541a4f1628e but that snippet bisected to an earlier commit eb3917c260b

[18:17] *** robertle_ left
[18:22] <cfa> AlexDaniel: interesting

[18:23] <cfa> hopefully that snippet is small enough; i left the conditional in there since there was talk of scoping issues with 4_

[18:23] <cfa> er, $_

[18:23] <cfa> but it seems so exhibits the same error

[18:28] <cfa> back in a bit, meetings

[18:29] <AlexDaniel> it seems like the golf is affected by eb3917c260b, but the same commit doesn't break the module itself

[18:30] <AlexDaniel> I'll leave a comment on that ticket

[20:09] <patrickb> I now have implemented some logic to determine the paths to /share/perl6/ and /share/nqp/ at runtime. They are required in the ModuleLoader (to determine the search paths, I think this happens very early on) and in RepositoryRegistry (setting the repository locations). Now I don't want to copy that logic. Where would be a good place/time to do them? Where would I stash the results?

[20:54] <patrickb> I somehow got it to work by putting the code at the top in main.nqp (that's about as early as possible :-P) and using bindhllsym.

[21:24] <japhb> patrickb: Does it slow down startup measurably? We'd like to avoid significant extra startup work where we can.  That said, maybe take a look at rakudo/src/core/VM.pm6 ?

[21:25] <patrickb> I haven't measured yet. But I guess it's a price we have to pay.

[21:28] *** robertle left
[21:29] <japhb> patrickb: I meant calculating it twice, as opposed to calculating once in the VM and lifting the result up the stack as VM.pm6 does.
