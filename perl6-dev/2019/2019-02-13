[09:28] <lizmat> am I wrong?  It looks like travis is also stalled?  at 30fc5146ca875a28977 ?

[09:30] <lizmat> looks like the silentness of Geth coincides with the lack of Travis activity

[10:00] <jnthn> Hm, I see nothing on github status about notification problems...

[10:01] <jnthn> Though on the hooks page it shows appveyor and travis as getting hooks OK and some problem sending them to hack.p6c.org

[19:45] <japhb> jnthn: Why does https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/146ede2920 (the nqp one) require `$metaclass.set_is_mixin($new_type);` on the $is_mixin path but https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f09156240a (the rakudo one) doesn't?

[19:48] <timotimo>  because of nqp::newmixintype

[19:51] <japhb> But both commits use that ....

[19:52] *** vendethiel- left
[19:53] <timotimo> hm, maybe it was required for the rebootstrap

[19:54] <timotimo> oh

[19:54] <timotimo> perhaps because Metamodel::Mixins unconditionally passes :is_mixin

[19:54] <timotimo> and maybe only that does?

[19:54] <timotimo> dunno %)

[19:55] <timotimo> i've only seen the code in the diffs

[20:22] <vrurg> It looks like I'm getting closer to my dream: BUILD and TWEAK are being executed in roles in my fork.... That's so exciting, damn... ;)
