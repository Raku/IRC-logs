[13:21] <tbrowder> hi!

[13:39] <tbrowder> i'm having trouble finding how to run spectests on a specific directory (S26) with the locally built rakudo. this does NOT work:  "prove6  -e='./perl6' -Ilib t/spec/S26-documentation/*t"

[13:40] <tbrowder> the prove6 is from installed rakudo 2019.03 built on same moarvm

[13:46] *** AlexDaniel joined
[13:48] <ugexe> you want to run t/fudgeandrun or something like that

[13:53] <ugexe> perl6 t/harness6 t/spec/S26-documentation/*t <-- this also works

[13:55] <tbrowder> ugexe: thanks, that did it!

[17:00] <tbrowder> question on spectests: is master spectested on a regular basis? i'm getting some dubious tests but don't believe my branch changes should cause them. should i branch for small core changes off the last stable release instead of master?

[17:05] <ugexe> The only thing that is realistically ever spectested is master 

[17:16] *** robertle joined
[17:17] <tbrowder> hm, just ran make spectest on master and only got failures on S11-modules/require.t

[17:18] <samcv> AlexDaniel, regarding the malloc_trim(), this only releases memory from malloc to kernel. and since most things use our FSA i'd think it shouldn't be too much of a performance hit

[17:19] <samcv> FSA gets memory from malloc and malloc gets the memory from the kernel.

[17:20] <tbrowder> but when i run in one dir only i get "dubious" results or failures. i must be missing something. the harness addition did help a bit, though.

[17:20] <ugexe> well you probably need to use t/fudgeandrun then

[17:21] <ugexe> since t/harness6 alone doesn't fudge anything i dont think

[17:21] <ugexe> i.e. your failures might just be things that are supposed to be fudged
