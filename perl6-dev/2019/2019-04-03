[18:10] <bartolin> I've stumbled upon an optimizer bug on the JVM backend.

[18:10] <bartolin> r: $_ = 'Hello'; { say $_ }

[18:10] <bartolin> Well, this gives '(LoweredAwayLexical)' on the JVM backend.

[18:11] <bartolin> I've described my findings at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2810 but I don't have an idea how to proceed from there.

[18:12] <bartolin> jnthn: ^^ maybe you could take a quick look at this (whenever convenient to you)?

[18:40] <Geth> Â¦ roast: I'm pretty sure the comma was placed there by accident (it was introduced back in 2016 during a refactoring of the test: 14d35ed5723aa8615759507a60b463d95db143a5).
