[23:48] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: For use in supporting user-defined control exceptions. This is handled

[23:48] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: correctly already on MoarVM; it's not clear that other backends will

[23:48] <Geth> Â¦ nqp: have got things the same way, but defining the constant at least means

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Previously, there was no way to define custom control exceptions. This

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: provides a way to do so: an exception that `does X::Control` will be

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: thrown as a control exception, and so seen by CONTROL blocks rather than

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: CATCH ones.

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: 

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: This space needs a bit more fleshing out generally; none of the existing

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: CX classes can actually be thrown correctly and just go as CATCH

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: exceptions (this was already the situation; this change does not make

[23:52] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: things worse).
