[19:16] <masak> "the best Rakudo to date!" :)

[19:29] <vrurg> Does anybody knows why nqp::invokewithcapture doesn't support invokation handles?

[19:34] <Kaiepi> if an op on the js vm requires the thread context do i need to pass :ctx as an arg in srv/vm/js/Operations.js?

[19:34] <Kaiepi> s/\.js/.nqp/

[20:49] <Kaiepi> <Kaiepi> grr, i can't build the js vm without bugging the maintainers of some of it's dependencies to make them build properly on openbsd

[20:49] <Kaiepi> <Kaiepi> such as https://github.com/node-ffi-napi/node-ffi-napi/issues/40
