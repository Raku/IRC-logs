[18:24] <patrickb> vrurg: Did you see the travis error on that PR?

[18:25] <patrickb> vrurg: Also I don't have the priviledges to merge that PR...

[18:25] <gfldex> MasterDuke: HEAD

[18:26] <MasterDuke> gfldex: oh well, thought maybe there was a quick fix

[18:28] <vrurg> patrickb: jvm... I may need some help with it.

[18:28] * vrurg never used Java.

[18:29] <patrickb> I think the first two build jobs are not java...

[18:30] <patrickb> Don't be fooled by the title.

[18:31] <vrurg> I'm not worried about those two.

[18:33] <vrurg> But java is problematic.

[18:43] <bartolin> the failure for the seconde (and fourth) jvm build is expected. NQP master requires java 9 since earlier today.

[18:45] <bartolin> and 'make test' didn't work before. so it looks as before the merge for the JVM backend, doesn't it?

[18:47] <vrurg> bartolin: I'm fixing it for java 9 right now. Otherwise I had successfull builds of jvm earlier.

[18:48] <bartolin> well, maybe I looked at the wrong place. what goes wrong for the jvm build at the moment?

[18:48] <MasterDuke> gfldex: does --optimize=0 change anything?

[18:52] <bartolin> vrurg: are you aware that there is a branch that should be merged after the next bump for nqp -- to make travis use java 9 to build rakudo? 

[18:53] <vrurg> bartolin: No, I'm not.

[18:55] <vrurg> Ok, I'm into fixing a smaller problem for now. And would leave java 8 as the default for now. Would I need to pre-merge that branch to make travis happy when I finally switch to 9?

[18:56] <bartolin> no problem, we (I) can do that later.

[18:58] <vrurg> bartolin: thanks! May I ping you later today if help with jvm needed?

[19:00] <bartolin> vrurg: yes, please do. I'll try to help -- unless I already went to bed :) in that case I could take a look tomorrow.

[19:01] <bartolin> from my perspective we could fix arising problems for the jvm backend after a merge.

[19:06] <patrickb> bartolin: That's great! You're a better fit to help with JVM stuff than I am. Thanks!

[19:07] <vrurg> bartolin: that's the best gift I could dream of! ;) I'll try to get it compiling for me anyway.

[19:08] <vrurg> Will step back only if it takes too long.

[19:09] <bartolin> vrurg++ ;)

[19:10] <vrurg> patrickb: one fix would involve a couple of changes into templates. Shall I make another PR for that?

[20:07] <vrurg> lizmat: You need to update submodules.

[20:07] <bartolin> vrurg: I'll look into telling travis to use java 11, too

[20:07] <lizmat> and how does one do that ?

[20:08] <vrurg> It was a tradeoff: either Configure.pl starts slow but updates them automatically, or we do it manually.

[21:53] <timotimo> i bet they're rubbish :) :)

[21:54] <timotimo> you mean 184 and 236, right?

[21:54] <patrickb> 2013 and 2014

[21:54] <patrickb> yes

[21:54] <timotimo> left margin from raw blocks and disable perl5 warnings

[21:55] <timotimo> i think perl5 warnings has been superceded by "use isms"

[21:57] <vrurg> Does it take some time for travis to update build status? nqp now builds with jvm but the summary still displays a problem.

[21:58] <vrurg> Ah, nevermind, a test failed.

[22:01] <bartolin> I wondered about the failing test, too. It seems to miss com.sun.jna.Callback. That doesn't happen on HEAD, so it might be related to a different travis setup. (it has 'language "java" on HEAD)

[22:02] <timotimo> patrickb: i closed one of the two

[22:02] <vrurg> bartolin: it just have failed on my mac too. So, it's not about travis.

[22:04] <bartolin> vrurg: the test passes locally for me (FreeBSD with JDK 11). which java do you use?

[22:04] <vrurg> Just have switched to 11.

[22:05] <patrickb> one more PR and we are down to three pages :-D

[22:05] <timotimo> aye!

[22:05] <bartolin> well, I wasn't on your branch when I tested. but anyway, I think that could be fixed after a merge. It's much more important that the stuff works for MoarVM

[22:10] <vrurg> bartolin: Ok, I'd leave it at this point. Need to make sure rakudo jvm builds too.

[22:11] * vrurg wonders who would merge NQP PR.

[22:11] <patrickb> Just so I understand it. Is the rakudo build broken without that PR?

[22:14] <MasterDuke> vrurg: there's an NQP PR that needs to be merged?

[22:15] <vrurg> MasterDuke: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/531

[22:15] <MasterDuke> vrurg: btw, you don't have NQP commit ability?

[22:15] <vrurg> patrickb: in certain cases.

[22:16] <vrurg> MasterDuke: neither nqp nor rakudo.

[22:16] <MasterDuke> vrurg: for rakudo you need to sign the CLA, but NQP is easier

[22:17] <vrurg> patrickb: There some new command line options like --github-user which are aimed at easing synchronous development of rakudo-nqp-moar in forked repositories.

[22:17] <vrurg> MasterDuke: no problem.

[22:22] <patrickb> let me search the logs

[22:23] <MasterDuke> vrurg: merged the PR, looks like i don't have permissions to add you to the perl6 org (or at least i couldn't figure out how)

[22:24] <vrurg> MasterDuke: no rush. Thanks for the merge!

[22:25] <vrurg> patrickb: thanks!

[22:32] <MasterDuke> ++s all around

[22:35] <bartolin> well, now I see the failing test t/nativecall/01-basic.t on the jvm backend, too. but that's for later.

[22:36] <bartolin> more importantly, the new configure doesn't recognize my make (on FreeBSD 11). 'make -v' doesn't reveal much.

[22:37] <vrurg> bartolin: BSD make, of course... Can you use gmake for a while?

[22:37] <vrurg> I'll have it fixed ASAP.

[22:37] <bartolin> vrurg: yeah, I can work around it. just wanted to report it for now.

[22:51] <bartolin> it looks like the generated executables 'nqp' and 'nqp-j' don't have the jna-4.0.0.jar in their classpath. If I add that manually, t/nativecall/01-basic.t passes

[22:53] <vrurg> rakudo builds and install with javac --source 1.9

[22:54] <vrurg> bartolin: Those are parts I know nothing about. Could have lost something when was moving command lines from generating scripts into templates.

[23:03] <bartolin> I'm testing a patch that re-adds those jars. (But I have to admit that I don't know much about those parts as well.)

[23:05] <vrurg> make test in rakudo hangs. Though do to parallelizing it's not clear what exact test hangs.

[23:05] <vrurg> But ok, enough jvm for today. 

[23:06] <MasterDuke> you can set the number of jobs to 1

[23:06] * vrurg was always a java hater, to the irony of it.

[23:06] <bartolin> oh, 'make test' doesn't work for Rakudo on the jvm backend :/ There is a severe memory (whatever) leak with the EvalServer

[23:07] <bartolin> (it used to run a few test files successfully, but not many)

[23:07] <vrurg> Then I'm not worried anymore. For what was started as a way to simplify adding a new revision letter it's already good enough output. ;)

[23:08] <MasterDuke> huh, i thought `make test` did work for the jvm backend

[23:08] <bartolin> let's see if that make travis happy again.

[23:08] <bartolin> MasterDuke: it works for nqp, but not for rakudo

[23:08] <MasterDuke> ah

[23:09] <bartolin> I run a spectest from time to time -- but without the EvalServer

[23:11] <vrurg> 990% CPU consumption – java breaks the record of my macbook!

[23:11] <bartolin> (and yes, it would make sense to look at 'make test', too. it's just a lack of time.

[23:12] <vrurg> This is better than any ports event. 1000! It did it! On just 6 cores. :D
