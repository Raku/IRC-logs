[19:31] <AlexDaniel> this is interesting: https://github.com/jnthn/p6-concurrent-stack/issues/1

[19:34] <AlexDaniel> does it mean that you can MitM with a module? Make a module that has its name set to “JSON::Fast”, then figure out a way to depend on the actual JSON::Fast

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> if done right I don't think that even unbitrot repo will show anything suspicious
