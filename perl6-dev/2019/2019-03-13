[03:20] <MasterDuke> bartolin: many thanks, i'm really not firing on all cylinders, but you're pointing out the fixes left and right. i corrected one or two coercion tests that needed a change, now all that's left are two sprintf tests

[03:24] <MasterDuke> bartolin: one of which is `is(nqp::sprintf('%17.3g', [3.000000000000e-04]), '           0.0003', '%17.3g 3.000000000000e-04');` is now giving me '3.0E-4', but expected value is '0.0003'. https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/t/hll/06-sprintf.t#L308

[03:25] <MasterDuke> bartolin: haven't yet figured out if the problem is in sprintf's directive:<g>() https://github.com/MasterDuke17/nqp/blob/temp_default_int_fix/src/HLL/sprintf.nqp#L427-L437 or somewhere else

[04:46] *** Kaypie is now known as Kaiepi

[07:34] <bartolin> MasterDuke: It looks like this special case for the jvm backend (introduced back in 2013 as "ugly hack") is executed: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/e60119f05ea7d7e8d9162f548b44637886fcb9a4/src/HLL/sprintf.nqp#L326-L330

[07:35] <bartolin> MasterDuke: my first suspicion is that the code doesn't work anymore because $num is typed now. With the following change t/hll/06-sprintf.t passes: https://gist.github.com/usev6/8b21e936a2ee7850345086dd744104e3

[07:37] <bartolin> MasterDuke: there is a cleaner solution, probably. But I've to leave for $work now. (BTW, I also see failing tests in t/nqp/083-math.t, but I didn't look at your latest changes.)

[20:05] <timotimo> someone want to help me figure out the zstd code i wrote?

[20:06] *** leont joined
[20:07] <timotimo> if there were a visualizer for zstd byte format, that'd be kind of cool

[20:07] <timotimo> maybe i could find out what's going wrong, or where

[20:10] *** brrt joined
[20:12] <timotimo> figured it out

[20:12] <timotimo> it was, of course, an off-by-one

[20:12] <[Coke]> ah, the "I asked the internet and immediately was able to fix it" phenomenon

[20:17] <timotimo> not quite

[20:17] <timotimo> i've asked a few hours ago already

[20:18] *** dogbert17 joined
[20:20] <[Coke]> Ah, but you had to ask here to get it to work. :)

[20:21] <bartolin> MasterDuke: you can forget about the failing tests in t/nqp/083-math.t I mentioned earlier. It turned out they are caused by a recently introduced bug in openjdk8 on FreeBSD (that's what I tested on): https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=234689

[20:22] <bartolin> that was a ... surprising result of my debugging session :)
