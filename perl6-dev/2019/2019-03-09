[21:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[21:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - only need to look at &where if we have post-constraints

[21:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - only need to call &where if there is one, otherwise just string (for now)

[21:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: - remove obvious erroneous "return Nil", shouldn't affect .perl

[22:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Remove :where support for Signature/Parameter.perl

[22:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[22:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The "where" parameter was only used on the internal !gistperl method, but

[22:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: that was never called with a "where" parameter.  So remove this complication

[22:03] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: all the way up
