[04:39] <Kaiepi> since i'm starting my grant work as soon as i finish parallelizing feed operators and supporting <<== and ==>>, there's something i want to ask

[04:40] <Kaiepi> i don't like how IO::Socket::INET has two separate host and port named arguments when the :listen argument should be enough to determine if the socket is a server or a client

[04:40] <Kaiepi> is this something i can change for v6.e?

[14:04] <Kaiepi> is there something i'm doing wrong in R#2951?

[14:05] <Kaiepi> #2591

[14:05] <Kaiepi> R#2591

[14:05] <timotimo> synopsebot is down

[14:05] <Kaiepi> oh

[14:05] <Kaiepi> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2951

[14:06] <timotimo> also needs "git submodule update" inside rakudo perhaps?

[14:06] <Kaiepi> tried that

[14:08] <Kaiepi> OH

[14:08] <Kaiepi> trying it again it works now

[14:15] <vrurg> Kaiepi: you probably ran Configure.pl in a directory which wasn't updated for long. 

[14:19] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: timo assigned to vrurg Issue "use v6.*" no longer works https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2952

[14:20] <timotimo> i hope that's fine ^

[14:22] <vrurg> timotimo: thanks! Will take care ASAP.

[22:26] <jnthn> vrurg: Will take a look at the problem-solving issue tomorrow; today ended up rather busy

[22:26] <vrurg> jnthn: NP, thanks! 

[22:27] <vrurg> I've got enough other problems to work on already. ;)

[22:38] <jnthn> Kaiepi: One option for INET::Socket::INET would be to introduce alternative construction methods (like IO::Socket::Async has listen/connect callable on the type object) that encode the server/client side in the constructor's method name

[22:39] <jnthn> *IO::Socket::INET

[22:40] <jnthn> In fact, aligning that more with IO::Socket::Async may make sense, in that the latter was based on "what should a Perl 6 API look like for this", whereas I think IO::Socket::INET was more influenced by history. :)

[22:40] <jnthn> I'd avoid back-compat breaks if we can.
