[12:02] <pamplemousse> cygx: The module freezer is really nifty. I think it may also avoid some of the problems I've been running into with locating the modules when running the script itself after packaging if I'm understanding things correctly, which would be fantastic

[19:04] <vrurg> How come CompUnit::Handle ends up containing not the requested module after nqp::loadbytecodefh??

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> hah, I was thinking that comments in the problem-solving repo looked too much like blog posts, and now I see that they actually are!

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> well, at least one for sure :)

[21:18] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: now that I think about it… why MoarVM and nqp are not submodules?

[21:22] <timotimo> isn't having submodules in moarvm torture enough? and now we have them in the other two repos as well for build system stuff? %)

[21:34] *** anagura joined
[21:43] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: don't know. But I had the same thought.

[21:44] <vrurg> timotimo: with autoupdate on pull they're great thing to have. 

[21:45] <vrurg> What I never tried is submodules in submodules.

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> should work? that's why it is --recursive, right? :)

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: how is it torture?

[21:47] <timotimo> just flashbacks to when i made moarvm impossible to update without manual intervention

[21:50] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: presumably. I just mean that never tested it this way.

[21:50] *** chloekek left
[21:55] <vrurg> timotimo: I gues it was something similar to our problems with nqp-configure until fresh Configure.pl was rolled out with default autoupdate.

[21:56] <timotimo> not quite

[21:56] <timotimo> git wouldn't "git pull" because there was a folder in the way

[21:56] <vrurg> Submoduling NQP would make some code in Configure.pl obsolete. NQP_VERSION would only be needed to verify for the lowest supported version.

[21:56] <timotimo> i tried to turn a folder with stuff in it into a separate git repository that's included via a submodule

[21:58] <vrurg> Ah, yes. git demands one to be pretty strict on submodule policies. I had to grasp the concept in full in order to not stumble on this kind of problem.

[21:59] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: nice lightning talk. there's probably enough material about the bots that you could even do a 20min talk at least

[22:00] <timotimo> oh, AlexDaniel did a lightning talk? link, please?

[22:00] <MasterDuke> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenl6JEum5k, around 8:02:00

[22:02] <MasterDuke> https://youtu.be/tenl6JEum5k?t=29025

[22:02] <timotimo> found it, thanks!

[22:05] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: thanks!

[22:05] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: nicely done/presented

[22:06] <vrurg> is the sound choppy in the video itself or is it my earbud?

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yeah, it is clipping

[22:06] <timotimo> yeah :<

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: thank you too :)

[22:07] *** anagura left
[22:09] <vrurg> AlexDaniel++!

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: there's a lot of fun material for sure. I don't know about doing longer talks, lightning talks is possibly the only format I'd enjoy doing

[22:09] * vrurg never fits into 5mins...

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> I timed the final version like 5 times and it was around 4:15 every time. So I thought OK, cool, I'll talk slower

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> and the talk was… like 3.5 minutes? I didn't even get to the first *ding*

[22:11] <MasterDuke> i always always always talk faster than i practiced when i'm doing the real thing

[22:11] <timotimo> ha

[22:11] <timotimo> i always have more stuff than i wanted to present

[22:12] <timotimo> last lightning talk was on SDL2, and i spent almost all time on explaining one bit of one of the examples, not being able to show off the other examples m(

[22:14] <AlexDaniel> after all my thesis stuff I kinda didn't want to do talks at all, the preparation is just too stressful :S

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> but ok, first conference, no idea if I'll attend anything else soon, so let's make it count x)

[22:15] <timotimo> i applaud you

[22:18] <AlexDaniel> if you want to hear more of my clipped voice, there's this time I shouted into the mic too: https://youtu.be/tenl6JEum5k?t=31925

[22:19] <timotimo> heh

[22:22] <MasterDuke> heh. i usually listen to stuff at 1.5x speed, so it's always a little weird when i then hear the same person at 1.0x

[22:23] <timotimo> ha

[22:23] <timotimo> i would always say "could you speak up", you would always say "could you speak faster"
