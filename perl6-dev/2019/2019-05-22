[18:05] <lizmat> hmmm... if a nqp::can(object,"Foo"), can there be a situation that object.Foo will fail nonetheless ?

[18:05] <lizmat> *is true

[18:11] <timotimo> if the find_method metaobjectmethod is silly?

[18:11] <timotimo> i dunno

[18:12] *** pamplemousse left
[18:12] <lizmat> ah, so if a metaobject doesn't have a find_method method, nqp::can will return 0 ?  or return 1?

[19:01] <timotimo> oh, er

[19:01] <timotimo> i think actually nqp::can goes via the method cache?

[19:01] <timotimo> but it can probably also invoke?
