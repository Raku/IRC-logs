[01:48] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo: any suggestions for how to use nqp::radix_I in nqp itself? right around here https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/QRegex/Cursor.nqp#L91, in the new Int() method i've added in my branch

[02:00] <timotimo> unsure. radix_I is for big integer types, and the only thing in the entirety of nqp that does something with _I ops is src/HLL/sprintf.nqp

[02:01] <MasterDuke> but it doesn't actually use radix_I

[02:01] <MasterDuke> it's used in some of the tests, which is where i got that `nqp::knowhow().new_type(:repr("P6bigint"))`

[02:02] <MasterDuke> m: "12000000000000000000000000000000000001" ~~ /\d+/; say $/.Int

[02:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «12000000000000000000000000000000000001␤»

[02:02] <MasterDuke> this is one of the things that's breaking after a new change i made on my branch

[02:03] <MasterDuke> calling nqp::intify on "12000000000000000000000000000000000001" gives 9223372036854775807

[02:03] <MasterDuke> and calling nqp::radix() gives 7461185575651901440

[02:09] <timotimo> m: say 9223372036854775807.base(16)

[02:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF␤»

[02:10] <timotimo> m: say 7461185575651901440.base(16)

[02:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «678B74C000000000␤»

[02:14] <timotimo> dunno why that happens, but i'm sure there's some reason

[02:14] <timotimo> but i'm not sure how nqp's match role should support .Int on very big numbers

[02:15] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say(nqp::from_I("12000000000000000000000000000000000001", Int))

[02:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤No registered operation handler for 'from_I'␤»

[02:15] <MasterDuke> m: use nqp; say(nqp::fromstr_I("12000000000000000000000000000000000001", Int))

[02:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «12000000000000000000000000000000000001␤»

[02:16] <timotimo> if the method Int would take the type as an argument, that'd work totally fine

[02:16] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S05-capture/match-object.t#L30

[02:17] <timotimo> is NQPMatchRole actually what does that?

[02:17] <timotimo> surely there's some class it gets mixed into inside rakudo

[02:17] <timotimo> and that can just .Int the .Str

[02:17] <MasterDuke> Capture

[02:17] <MasterDuke> which doesn't have its own .Int

[02:19] <MasterDuke> oops, https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Match.pm6#L1

[02:20] <timotimo> OK, would it work to just give that an Int method?

[02:20] <MasterDuke> trying that now

[02:22] <MasterDuke> oh, i just tried by removing Int() and Num() from NQPMatchRole, but i think those do get called during the nqp compile...

[02:28] <MasterDuke> oh, or what about just doing `method Int() { self.Str.Int }` in NQPMatchRole?

[02:34] <timotimo> i'm not sure if the .Str will already be hllized to perl6 after the .self.Str call

[02:34] <timotimo> i.e. it might give a nqp-style string

[02:34] <timotimo> and that wouldn't know how to make a perl6 Int either

[02:36] <timotimo> i'm going to sleep. good luck!

[02:36] <timotimo> i'm not sure if you can check if an hll is registered or not, otherwise you could try nqp::hllizefor on the Str to turn it into a perl6 string which *does* have an .Int method that can do it right

[02:36] <timotimo> m: use nqp; nqp::hllizefor(1, "florb")

[02:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: ( no output )

[02:36] <timotimo> m: use nqp; nqp::hllizefor("florb", 1)

[02:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «This type cannot unbox to a native string: P6opaque, Int␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[02:37] <timotimo> it'll just silently fail?

[02:37] <timotimo> m: use nqp; nqp::hllizefor(1, "florb").DUMP.say

[02:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[02:37] <timotimo> m: use nqp; nqp::hllizefor("bleep", "florb").DUMP.say

[02:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar f56e0756f: OUTPUT: «"bleep"␤»

[02:38] <timotimo> *shruuuuuug*, you can potentially hllizefor it with perl6 in the Int method there and call .Int on the result. if it results in a rakudo Str it'll be cool, otherwise it'll just give bogus numbers i guess?

[02:38] <timotimo> good night/day!

[02:42] <MasterDuke> thanks, i'll give that a shot. later...
