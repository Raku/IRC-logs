[00:01] <timotimo> one thing you can always do, which doesn't necessarily do much, is replacing postcircumfix:<[ ]> with AT-POS or ASSIGN-POS

[00:52] <ugexe> timotimo: i just thought of something... that base64 Distribution thing + a slightly tweaked CURFS could solve the $*DISTRIBUTION / %?RESOURCES thing for your fat packer

[00:58] <ugexe> would it be possible to set something like @*FAT-PACKED-DISTRIBUTIONS which contains a list of META6 data hashes (with the inline base64 data)

[00:58] <ugexe> then I could write a CUR to use @*FAT-PACKED-DISTRIZBUTIONS

[12:43] <nine> patrrickb: ok, thanks for checking! Will have a look at what may be wrong on my side

[12:45] <ugexe> so i need a way to either exclude all default repos, or a way to define the default repos at runtime. the former would allow the later via -I / PERL6LIB so that might be the best option. how do we present this option?

[12:45] <ugexe> perl6 --blorg ... ?

[12:47] <ugexe> the use case is spawning a perl6 from within a perl6 program and allowing it to have a matching $*REPO. if you just pass in $*REPO.repo-chain you end up with duplicates

[12:48] <ugexe> that would not be the case if some flag disabled all default repos
