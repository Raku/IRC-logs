[09:49] <lizmat> thats.... unexpected

[09:50] <timotimo> hm. i already knew about %0

[09:51] <lizmat> bisectable6: old=2016.05 "abcd" ~~ m/(\w)+/; say %0

[09:51] <bisectable6> lizmat, On both starting points (old=2016.05 new=f05b1b0) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[09:51] <bisectable6> lizmat, Output on both points: «{a => ｢b｣, c => ｢d｣}␤»

[09:51] <timotimo> it's equivalent to %($0)

[09:51] <timotimo> which explains why it has the keys a and c

[09:51] <lizmat> and what is the use ?

[09:51] <timotimo> it uses the "every other element becomes a key or a value" thing

[09:52] <timotimo> dunno :)

[09:52] <lizmat> m: my $width = 4; printf("%0{$width}d", 42)   # makes this really weird

[09:52] <timotimo> yeah

[09:52] <[Tux]> Rakudo version 2019.03.1-628-gf05b1b080 - MoarVM version 2019.05-87-ga601746d6

[09:52] <timotimo> may have to go with $($width) there

[09:53] <lizmat> m: my $width = 4; printf("%0$($width)d", 42)   # makes this really weird

[09:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar f05b1b080: OUTPUT: «0042»

[09:54] <lizmat> yeah, that's a workaround... but I'm not getting the raison d'être of %0 at all

[09:54] <timotimo> probably just "consistency with @0 and $0

[09:54] <timotimo> m: say &0

[09:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar f05b1b080: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[09:54] <timotimo> this also exists it seems like

[09:55] <timotimo> that's certainly odd, too

[09:55] <lizmat> yeah... I think we've found a wart 

[09:59] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: ? can I have a gist?

[10:03] <lizmat> https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/44

[10:11] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: away from my laptop currently, will ping you when you can have it

[10:22] <Guest77572> AlexDaniel: are you a Doctor or Professor now?

[10:27] <AlexDaniel> Guest77572: just finished my Master's, so not that far yet :)

[10:27] <AlexDaniel> and not sure if I want to go further

[10:28] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: AlexDaniel assigned to jnthn Issue %0 and &0 should probably be syntax errors https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/44

[12:41] <Guest77572> they are Masters of the universe :)

[12:43] <Guest77572> releasable next

[12:43] <Guest77572> releasable: next

[12:43] <releasable6> Guest77572, Next release in ≈1 day and ≈6 hours. 3 blockers. 257 out of 628 commits logged (⚠ 3 warnings)

[12:43] <releasable6> Guest77572, Details: https://gist.github.com/a50d760c7a30685dc1ca4116c3183bac

[12:43] <Guest77572> only three blockers, interesting

[12:44] <Guest77572> M#1104 is obviously not a blocker

[12:44] <synopsebot_> M#1104 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1104 Spectest failures on 32 bit after commit 2fe2f588

[12:45] *** vrurg joined
[12:47] *** AlexDaniel joined
[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> Guest77572: 

[12:48] <AlexDaniel`> you're kidding, right?

[12:49] <timotimo> there's a fix in moarvm already, didn't that help? i believe we weren't able to test it because the windows build is broken for any number of reasons all the time

[13:09] <Guest77572> of course I'm kidding, I think it should be a blocker :)

[13:10] <Guest77572> oh, I now see that it is a blocker. I'll verify it when I get home from $work

[13:12] <Guest77572> I believe that I tested it after timotimo's fixes and the problems persisted but I might be mistaken

[13:36] *** discord6 left
[13:36] *** discord6 joined
[13:43] <patrickb> How can such a comment possibly *not* slip through the cracks? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/2fe2f588fd931e9bed982da97f352207ddab9e62#commitcomment-33930846

[13:45] <timotimo> oh, i saw that. i just didn't know how best to react to it; we'll definitely need a libtommath bump

[13:47] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: for some reason gist doesn't like any of these files when I try drag them in, so I just bundled them up https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IBY6c9W1/p6out.tar.xz

[13:47] <kawaii> probably something to do with their names

[13:47] <kawaii> shrug

[13:47] <AlexDaniel> I think there was a UI issue and it depended on where you drag it to

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: I think it didn't manage to generate an svg because graphviz is not installed on your system

[13:51] <kawaii> probably

[13:56] *** vrurg left
[14:00] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2998

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: there are 4 modules with an issue coming from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2683b3d098, maybe you can take a look

[14:02] <lizmat> grrr...  :-)

[14:02] <lizmat> which modules ?

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2998

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> errors are like: Type check failed for return value; expected Seq but got List ($(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1))

[14:05] <lizmat> yeah, I think those tests are too strict

[14:06] <lizmat> but lemme check

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: here's a separate ticket for that issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2999

[14:10] *** lucasb joined
[14:11] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: also if you can fix that annoying “perl: warning: Setting locale failed.” issue for the next run that'd be awesome

[14:12] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: yeah sorry about that, I just didn't install my language on the VM I used to run the test

[14:12] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: if I let List.reverse return a Seq, make install doesn't work: Type check failed for return value; expected List:D but got Seq ($((:E14CAA5C7DE5B1A1B...)

[14:12] <lizmat> so in a sense, we're between a rock and a hard place there

[14:12] <AlexDaniel> it's ok for this time, but later when the output is clean we'll use it to populate ecosystem-unbitrot, so ideally it shouldn't have any unrelated errors

[14:13] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: interesting :) It used to work at some point though?

[14:13] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: I'll create PR's to fix the tests of those 4 modules

[14:14] <lizmat> hmmm....

[14:14] <lizmat> maybe not...

[14:14] <lizmat> lemme double check

[14:14] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: 4 modules is a lot, actually, and it's not like the change is an obvious bugfix

[14:15] <lizmat> you could argue that, but generally tests shouldn't need to worry about whether a List or a Seq is returned, imo

[14:20] *** vrurg joined
[14:23] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: running spectest with a fix now

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: hello!

[14:24] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: hi!

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: if you can check HTTP::Server::Tiny that'd be awesome :)

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2998

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: Calling parse-http-request(Buf[uint8]) will never work with declared signature (Blob $req is copy)

[14:25] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: will try tomorrow. Still at TPC, attending a talk right now.

[14:26] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: sure, thanks

[14:32] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: I'll be away for a bit, so feel free to investigate into the remaining ones

[14:32] <Geth> ¦ roast: a96a2d48f4 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | S03-metaops/hyper.t

[14:32] <Geth> ¦ roast: Revert "Fix questionable test related to .reverse"

[14:32] <Geth> ¦ roast: 

[14:32] <Geth> ¦ roast: This reverts commit 2d1bd6ccf0321851c2f75c4bd726c70598073dd6.

[14:32] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/a96a2d48f4

[14:32] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: NativeHelpers::Blob is seemingly related too.

[14:33] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: you mean, annoy the people who made the breaking commits? ;)

[14:33] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: yeah, and WebSocket fails because of HTTP::Server:Tiny :)

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 8ddc2ad503 | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | src/core/List.pm6

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make List.reverse return a Seq again

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Apparently having it return a list caused ecosystem test breakage.

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fixed R#2999.

[14:33] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8ddc2ad503

[14:33] <synopsebot_> R#2999 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2999 [BLOCKER][regression] Some ecosystem fallout after “Make List.reverse a bit less Seqqy” commit

[14:34] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: that only works for some specific issues, the rest needs to be golfed and ticketed separately

[14:35] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: NativeHelpers could be fixed with R#2717 but I hesitate to merge it because it requires two wrong tests to be removed from roast. Would be helpful if somebody review it.

[14:35] <synopsebot_> R#2717 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2717 Fix for #2714

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: uhh, I see. And that means that either there needs to be some backcompat for previous language releases, or we consider these tests to be flat out wrong and remove them from errata branches

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: you seem to have a grasp on that issue, can you take a look?

[14:43] <AlexDaniel> ===SORRY!===

[14:43] <AlexDaniel> internal problem: parser did not give circumfix an EXPR

[14:43] <AlexDaniel> O_o

[14:45] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: where is this one from?

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3000

[14:49] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: fwiw you can also check Test::Deeply::Relaxed :) That one is likely some issue in tests of the module itself, although I'm not entirely sure

[14:58] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: BTW, those controversial tests are fudged anyway: https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/514/files

[14:58] <vrurg> And marked as debatable by jnthn

[18:01] <vrurg> Guess so.

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: just throw them away then…

[18:01] <vrurg> Ok. The problem is – the fix is incomplete and doesn't cover the Blob/Buf case. 

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> gah :)

[18:02] <vrurg> I tested the module on that branch and it failed as well. 

[18:02] * vrurg have some more work to do.

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: any thoughts on how long it'll take you to finish it? Worst case

[18:03] <vrurg> Wors: next week. Best case – tomorrow. Depends on how things will go tomorrow.

[18:04] <AlexDaniel> alright, just keep us updated, there are other release things to do anyway…

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> could be the same bug that just trips a bunch of tests…
