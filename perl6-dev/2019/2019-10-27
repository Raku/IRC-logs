[15:17] <AlexDaniel> Hey! Sorry for the interruption once again, but most of us already moved to #raku-dev :) Please reconfigure your irc client to join #raku-dev and not join #perl6-dev, thanks!

[15:18] <timotimo> i'm staying here to guide people who come in here

[15:18] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: you can do it through discord, can't you? ;)

[15:19] <timotimo> hm. but discord doesn't show the users list

[15:27] <lucasb> haha, ok ok. I'll leave. Goodbye #perl6-dev o/

[15:27] <lucasb> (But I'll remain in *#perl6* for the lolz)

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> mst: I find it interesting that you didn't reconfigure your client yet :)

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> mst: anyway, what would be a good guess for the message limit here?

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> IIRC you have to calculate it based on something something, it wasn't very straightforwardâ€¦

[16:58] <mst> don't remember, sorry
