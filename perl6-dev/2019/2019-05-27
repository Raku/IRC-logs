[14:00] <vrurg> .tell lizmat I hope it's the last time you see a problem with the module. Check the value of `git config submodule.recurse` – it should be set to true now.

[14:00] <yoleaux> 06:15Z <lizmat> vrurg: Rakudo configure / build is borked after your commits :-(

[14:01] <yoleaux> vrurg: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[14:01] <yoleaux> 06:16Z <lizmat> vrurg: perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --make-install; # Can't locate object method "note" via package "NQP::Config::Rakudo"

[14:01] <yoleaux> 06:16Z <lizmat> vrurg: but that's just an error occurring in error reporting :-(

[14:01] <yoleaux> 06:17Z <lizmat> vrurg: a manual "git submodule update" seems to solve it, though

[14:01] <yoleaux> 06:43Z <lizmat> vrurg: now "make install" ends with "cp: /Users/liz/bin/../bin/perl6 and /Users/liz/bin/../bin/perl6-m are identical (not copied)." and 1 as exit code

[14:01] <lizmat> true now

[14:01] <yoleaux> 14:00Z <vrurg> lizmat: I hope it's the last time you see a problem with the module. Check the value of `git config submodule.recurse` – it should be set to true now.

[14:01] <vrurg> lizmat Not sure about --make-install problem as I can't reproduce it.

[14:02] <lizmat> well, that was caused by the fact that ~/bin/perl6 was a symlink to ~/bin/perl6-m

[14:02] <vrurg> lizmat: good, as expected. Submodules will be autoupdated now upon every git pull

[14:02] <lizmat> I removed ~/bin/perl6 and after that everything worked...

[14:03] <lizmat> perhaps check for target being a symlink to the source, and then not do anything ?

[14:06] <vrurg> lizmat: That would overcomplicate Makefile action. cp itself doesn't have such functionality. Neither has its counterpart from ExtUtils.

[14:06] <lizmat> ok, fair enough

[14:35] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: what about alerts.perl6.org?

[14:35] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: the source is here https://github.com/perl6/alerts/

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> the data… I have no idea where it is

[14:41] <timotimo> i think moritz was able to get a few things off of hack's old hard drive?

[14:42] <moritz> I was

[14:43] <moritz> but shouldn't the data be in a git repo as well, somewhere?

[14:43] <timotimo> it's an sqlite3 database, personally i wouldn't check that kind of thing into git

[14:50] *** jkramer_ left
[14:54] <moritz> so, were alerts added by manually running SQL commands in the db?

[14:54] <timotimo> no, it had an irc bot

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> honestly that's why I had using dbms for simple projects like this

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> it had like less than 10 entries, it could've easily been stored in flat files

[15:03] <timotimo> sqlite3 is a flat file format :)

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> why I hate* :)

[15:03] <timotimo> sqlite isn't a replacement for postgres, it's a replacement for fopen

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> yes… but that doesn't help…

[15:04] <timotimo> the problem was less using sqlite vs json, and more "not having any backups"

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> I disagree, because figuring out backups is extremely easy when using plain files

[15:05] <timotimo> how is it harder with sqlite?

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> just slap `git commit` after every change, github gives you storage. Done, solved

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> this  basically gives you a backup at every single change

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> now you explain to me how to do that with sqlite :)

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> need to find a server and upload your sqlite file somewhere, I guess

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> at some regular intervals, or whatever…

[15:07] <timotimo> why would you have to do it any different from the flat file?

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> “personally i wouldn't check that kind of thing into git”

[15:07] <timotimo> just slap `git commit` after every change, github gives you storage. done, solved

[15:07] <timotimo> i also wouldn't put a flat file into github for backups

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> why not?

[15:09] <timotimo> just preference i guess

[15:09] <timotimo> github for sources, other stuff for data

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> it especially makes sense for public open source services like… alerts.perl6.org :)

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> so that if there's like a huge bus for all of us, someone can still bring it back online

[15:10] <timotimo> where do we put secrets.json? :)

[15:11] <AlexDaniel> I'd put it nowhere

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: honestly, I'm a bit surprised you don't fancy the approach. It's beautiful, IMO

[15:32] <moritz> it's especially useful for something where the data doesn't change often
