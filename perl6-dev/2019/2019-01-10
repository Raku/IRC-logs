[16:14] <jnthn> Um, if we argued that Int:D should work, I mean.

[16:14] <lizmat> ok, so given a string "Int", can one create the type Int:D ?

[16:15] <lizmat> or is there no such thing ?

[16:17] <jnthn> First resolve the string into the Int type object, and then something like Metamodel::DefiniteHOW.new_type(:base_type(::('Int')), :definite)

[16:17] <jnthn> Well, I put the resolution of the string in there
