[06:18] <AlexDaniel> tobs: weird. Sounds so simple yet so hard

[06:21] <tobs> yeah, it's not nice, especially when you want the output of months to be optional and if omitted add the months worth of time to the days and so on. It's a back and forth between Duration and calendar properties :/

[16:28] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: with regard to github repos, here is what happened: git complained that my local branch is out of sync and pull is needed, even though both were untouched for a while. pulling ended up with merging remote branch and my local branch (both are actually the same!) and resulted in duplicated commits and overall it was all mess. 

[16:29] <vrurg> happened with two of my forked repos: roast and rakudo. Looks like lizmat got same problem too.

[16:36] <AlexDaniel> m: say 42

[16:36] <AlexDaniel> e: say 42

[16:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[16:36] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 7e5bd3197: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[16:36] <AlexDaniel> moritz: camelia is not following master, can you check?

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: can you give an example of a duplicated commit?

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: I mean, their shas

[16:47] <timotimo> walk a mile in my shas

[16:51] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: 7f1b75c92295375471052db4cae48076863873ad d1688600d2e82f4943d707231882327ad64abfc3 

[16:51] <vrurg> In perl6/roast

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> ok what the f is this

[16:52] * AlexDaniel looks

[16:52] <vrurg> For rakudo I caught it before PR was merged, so had to re-create and force-push my local branch.

[16:53] *** robertle joined
[16:55] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: according to this both commits came from your side: https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/575/commits

[16:55] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: note that the problem happened with my fork of roast. The commits then slipped in via PR merge because I was late in noticing the problem

[16:56] <vrurg> Right, we're writing at the same time. :)

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> also, force pushes are disabled in all repos

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> with “Include administrators” checked

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> on master branch only

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> something I fixed when things went wrong the last time… :)

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: unless someone was messing with your branch, I don't really see how that could've happened

[16:58] <vrurg> I always work on my fork except for very little changes. Then merge PRs. It's more manageable this way. But what the f happened with the fork is a mystery to me.

[16:58] <vrurg> The only thing I suspect is git gc on my side. But if it is the cause then why did it mess with hashes?

[17:00] <AlexDaniel> to me it looks like a rebase that went a bit wrong

[17:02] <vrurg> This is likely. I was always merging from the original repo using 'git pull upstream --ff --tags master' but decided that --rebase is better because it doesn't leave behind 'merge' commits.

[17:18] <Kaiepi> m: my subset Foo where Int | Str; my Foo:U $ = Nil; say 'success'; CATCH { default { say 'failure' } }

[17:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «success␤»

[17:18] <Kaiepi> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; my subset Foo where Int | Str; my Foo:U $ = Nil; say 'success'; CATCH { default { say 'failure' } }

[17:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «failure␤»

[17:18] <Kaiepi> is this supposed to succeed in v6.e?

[17:20] <vrurg> Kaiepi: no. 

[17:20] <vrurg> m: say Nil ~~ Int | Str

[17:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[17:21] <Kaiepi> oh

[17:21] <vrurg> Kaiepi: I mean it is rejected not by subset iself but by the smartmatch

[17:22] <Kaiepi> how do subsets in v6.e differ from how they were before?

[17:24] <vrurg> They're now check for variable value upon variable creation.

[17:25] <vrurg> m: subset SS of Any where { !.defined || $_ ~~ Int | Str }; my SS $s = Nil'

[17:26] <vrurg> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; subset SS of Any where { !.defined || $_ ~~ Int | Str }; my SS $s = Nil

[17:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: ( no output )

[17:26] <vrurg> ^ like this

[17:26] <vrurg> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; subset SS of Any where { !.defined || $_ ~~ Int | Str }; my SS $s = Nil; say $s.perl

[17:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «Any␤»

[17:28] <vrurg> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; subset SS of Int where Int | Str; my $ss = Nil; say $ss.perl

[17:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «Any␤»

[17:28] <vrurg> Kaiepi: ^ Or like this

[17:29] <vrurg> The other change is subsets are now getting nominalized. I.e. in your case it nominalizes into Any which doesn't match Int | Str

[17:32] <vrurg> m: subset SS of Int; my SS $s; say $s.WHAT;

[17:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «(SS)␤»

[17:33] <vrurg> m: use v6.e.PREVIEW; subset SS of Int; my SS $s; say $s.WHAT;

[17:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: «(Int)␤»

[17:53] <AlexDaniel> right

[17:53] <vrurg> BTW, to get done with all those containerize/decontainerize wars I proposed to include always-deconting Tuple and Dict into core.

[17:54] <vrurg> Tuple is lizmat work and is in the ecosystem already. Dict would be a 8-lines class with the latest changes.

[18:24] <AlexDaniel> damn I guess it'll reset in 35 minutes…

[18:25] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: R#3090 is partially fixed. It consists of two parts. One I have nailed down. The other, I'm afraid, also libuv-related because it is something about permission and detecting writability to a file.

[18:26] <AlexDaniel> damn

[19:23] <nine> Anyway, keeping the threads alive till all the mixing in is done makes my issue vanish completely. So yes, it's definitely thread destruction that's at fault here

[19:24] <timotimo> very good

[19:39] <robertle> vrurg: regarding R#3090: have you seen the digging we did on the debiian side? in our case the build environment uses LD_PRELOAD to fake root permissions in a chroot, and that did not wrap statx

[19:39] <synopsebot> R#3090 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3090 [BLOCKER][build] Installer does not play well with Arch Linux’s makepkg

[19:39] <robertle> recent libuv uses statx instead of stat() in most cases. even if you don't have the LD_PRELOAD thing, the statx() vs stat() insight may be helpful...

[19:41] <vrurg> robertle: unfortuantely, I don't have time for working on this. Hope patrickb will be able to look into it.

[19:42] <vrurg> robertle: Or I'd have to postpone rework of NQP makefiles but this would delay a merge of jvm backend major optimization.

[19:44] <robertle> reading the ticket again (I know nothing about arch's build system) I am almost certain that it is the exact same problem we had... so with some luck #935290 (debian bugsystem) helps you guys...

[19:47] <vrurg> robertle: may I ask you to report your findings to moarvm?

[19:47] <vrurg> Unless you've already done so.

[19:50] <Geth_> ¦ nqp: vrurg self-assigned [WIP] Provide common ground for all backend makefiles https://github.com/perl6/nqp/issues/578

[19:50] <MasterDuke> vrurg: fwiw, if by "jvm backend major optimization" you mean the truffle branch, i think it will be quite a while before it's ready to merge/replace the current jvm implementation

[19:51] <robertle> vrurg: it's all linked from #3090 :)

[19:52] <nine> timotimo: I guess it's no wonder that I come across something that forces me to read our gen2 code. It's more suprising I came so far without doing so :)

[19:52] <vrurg> MasterDuke: anyway, the later I'm done with nqp – the later you could start merging it. 

[19:52] <vrurg> robertle: it worth a ticket in moarvm because its developers can easily miss related tickets in rakudo.

[19:53] <MasterDuke> vrurg: yeah, i don't mean to dissuade you from anything, just that i don't think a major jvm optimization is on the near horizon

[19:56] <vrurg> MasterDuke: anyway, I want this be done before I'm totally demotivated. It's such an irritating task that I needed a couple of weeks after finished with rakudo. :)

[19:56] * vrurg is afk.
