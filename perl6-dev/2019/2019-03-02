[02:52] <synopsebot> RAKUDO#2166 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2166 :D subset type constraints erroneously typecheck True against themselves

[02:55] <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: you've met my requirements. I was looking for a dedicated place to discuss langauge design matters.

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: that's correct, we didn't really have a proper place for that

[02:58] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: note that you've been assigned to that issue

[02:59] <AlexDaniel> to clarify, with my proposal there are two ways it can go from here

[03:00] <AlexDaniel> 1. it can be closed with a PR to the problem-solving repo, likely with a description of the change and some justification (I'm expecting that rakudo and roast PRs will be required too)

[03:01] <AlexDaniel> 2. jnthn can just claim a shortcut and merge the rakudo and roast PRs right away

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> I guess that depends on how much jnthn wants things to be documented

[03:04] <Geth> ¦ roast: vrurg++ created pull request #515: Additional tests to check for perl6/rakudo#2166

[03:04] <Geth> ¦ roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/515

[03:04] <synopsebot> RAKUDO#2166 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2166 :D subset type constraints erroneously typecheck True against themselves

[03:07] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: what if the proposal is rejected? I guess no PR is required then and the issue could simply be closed with a reasoning.

[03:13] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: that's the idea behind discussing “initial proposals” first, so that the rejection can happen early on before any PRs are submitted

[03:15] <vrurg> Ok. I would need to learn the rules partially on practice. Either my English betrays me, or my brains are overloaded by now, but not everything in the README is clear to me.

[03:16] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: it's not you, it's just that the problem-solving repo itself is taking its baby steps

[03:16] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: please leave your feedback here https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/pull/2

[03:20] <AlexDaniel> sure :)
