[09:26] <pmurias> nine: I'm creating a CompUnit::Repository::Node

[09:27] <pmurias> https://paste.debian.net/1088166

[09:27] <pmurias> nine: but the problem is that modules in node.js export an arbitary object

[09:27] *** squashable6 joined
[09:50] *** patrickb joined
[10:05] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: hello, any good reason why rakudo repo is not under perl6 organization?

[10:06] <AlexDaniel> for example, a disadvantage of that is that it's impossible to move tickets from rakudo repo to problem-solving

[10:06] <AlexDaniel> arguably a github limitation, but still

[10:08] <kawaii> I assume because Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6, not Perl 6 itself AlexDaniel 

[10:09] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: but why a perl 6 implementation can't live in perl6 organization?

[10:10] <kawaii> So if more Perl 6 compilers were born, would they too live under the Perl 6 org, alongside Rakudo? 🤔

[10:10] <AlexDaniel> if they want to, why not?

[10:10] <AlexDaniel> the base permission in perl6 org is currently set to `read` only, so it's not about privileges I assume

[10:11] <kawaii> I don't think it matters either way, but might be nice to consolidate if there are no objections

[10:11] <kawaii> Though, it may give the impression that Rakudo is the 'official' Perl 6 compiler 

[10:12] <AlexDaniel> IMO same goes for MoarVM/ org which doesn't even have a logo :)

[10:12] <kawaii> Poor MoarVM, someone make those guys a logo please

[10:13] <kawaii> I _think_ it makes more sense for moar to move under the perl6 org, at least since Perl 6 is the only language that runs under that backend

[10:13] <AlexDaniel> moarvm.org repo is in MoarVM org, but rakudo.org is in perl6/ :)

[10:14] *** squashable6 left
[10:14] <kawaii> MoarVM is in sense, a first-class citizen in Perl 6 world, whereas Rakudo is more like a second/third-party component?

[11:15] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: I think different sets of commiters are the reason

[11:15] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: but this can be done using Teams, right?

[11:19] <kawaii> I doubt the list of committers between rakudo and nqp etc... are that different surely? 

[11:21] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: yeah, but committing to rakudo requires signing a CLA

[11:21] <AlexDaniel> that's the only difference I think

[11:52] <patrickb> Is there any real reasoning why rakudo would require a CLA and NQP or MoarVM don't?

[11:53] <patrickb> Especially because NQP is located under the "perl6/" umbrella and thus seems to have a tighter bound to TPF...

[11:54] <kawaii> Yes I wonder the same thing, Rakudo from what I can tell does not have any official attachment to TPF

[12:22] <patrickb> AlexDaniel, kawaii: What's your thoughts on the release planed in 3 days?

[12:22] <lizmat> patrickb: I understand why MoarVM doesn't, as it is something that jnthn started on his own

[12:23] <lizmat> patrickb: re nqp, I guess that's a similar situation, but that's more shrouded in the mists of time for me

[12:23] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: of the 3 blockers, I think this one at the very least should be dealt with https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2759

[12:23] <patrickb> s/planed/planned/

[12:24] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: also schedule wise, I am fine with 3 days time doing a release alongside you, are you also fine with this day?

[12:24] <kawaii> the other two blockers are... not as serious IMO

[12:24] <kawaii> at least not enough to prevent a release

[12:25] <kawaii> though I certainly need to be able to run Blin again, and can't currently until rba has got that cert in place

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> realistically? I don't think it's going to happen in exactly three days

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> we don't even have Blin results yet

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> I'm busy till tomorrow, then I'm mostly free

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> AppVeyor is still broken, is there a ticket about it somewhere?

[12:52] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: It's one of the three blockers

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> ah yeah, marked as blocker

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> ok

[12:53] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: Did you notice the autocomplete in rakudobrew? :-)

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> not great, not terrible

[12:53] <timotimo> nqp was initially more a part of parrot, right? did parrot have a cla?

[12:54] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: no, but I did notice that I had to manually choose Bash in the config, and was pissed off a bit :)

[12:54] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: but now that you said it, it's pretty awesome!

[12:58] *** vrurg joined
[13:00] <patrickb> vrurg: o/

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: btw why can't we use $SHELL to figure out which shell it is?

[13:01] <vrurg> Hi!

[13:01] <vrurg> patrickb: sitting at TPC now. Would try to be useful if anything is needed.

[13:02] <vrurg> patrickb: do you know what went wrong for nine?

[13:02] <patrickb> vrurg: Which TPC?

[13:02] <timotimo> in riga?

[13:03] <vrurg> Pittsburg

[13:03] <timotimo> ah, merica

[13:03] <patrickb> AlexDaniel: I'm not sure anymore. It was quite an adventure before I arrived at the current solution. I think there is no reliably way to determine the shell currently running. With $SHELL my memory is foggy. Might have been a problem with that variable not being reset when spawning subshells.

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: the question is whether we can indeed make sure that the current state of rakudo doesn't have additional serious bugs that the previous release didn't have

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: without the info from Blin I really can't tell

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> but AppVeyor tests should definitely pass before we make a new release

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: status

[13:05] <patrickb> vrurg: Sadly I don't. The piece of the console log he pasted contained "bash config.status".

[13:05] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in ≈3 days and ≈5 hours. 3 blockers. 221 out of 624 commits logged (⚠ 1 warnings)

[13:05] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Details: https://gist.github.com/5d1b217b07cb0ec551cb85f9d1968824

[13:06] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: yes I know, but Blin is currently inoperable due to the TLS issue, hopefully I can trigger one tonight

[13:07] <patrickb> vrurg: Do you live in the US? I somehow assumed you'd live in the Netherlands...

[13:07] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: yeah, so 3.6 blockers :)

[13:07] <vrurg> patrickb: wish I could see what's in that config.status.How come it came up with unix/nqp-m template whereas there is no such thing whatsoever?

[13:07] <AlexDaniel> until we get data from Blin

[13:08] <vrurg> patrickb: No, haven't been to Europe for almost 5 years now. :)

[13:08] <patrickb> :-)

[13:15] <nine> vrurg: I'm pretty sure it was: /usr/bin/perl Configure.pl "--git-protocol=https" "--prefix=/home/nine/rakudo/install" "--backends=moar" "--expand=/home/nine/rakudo/nqp/tools/templates/unix/nqp-m" "--out=nqp-m" $*

[13:15] <yoleaux> 12:16Z <vrurg> nine: Please, when you complain about a build problem – tell me how you got into it. Best – make a ticket.

[13:15] <nine> The --expand and --out part was what caused the issue. I got it working by running Configure.pl manually.

[13:16] <vrurg> nine: That's fixed already. Perhaps you didn't run your Configure for a couple of weeks.

[13:16] <vrurg> Yes, it was erroneously saving config.status with --expand 

[13:17] <nine> vrurg: well I _was_ trying to run Configure.pl :)

[13:19] <nine> So what about camelia's build issue? File 'unix/nqp-m-' not found in base directory /home/camelia/rakudo-m-2/nqp/tools/templates in file /home/camelia/rakudo-m-2/nqp/tools/templates/moar/Makefile.in at /home/camelia/rakudo-m-2/nqp/3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib/NQP/Config.pm line 862. at /home/camelia/rakudo-m-2/nqp/3rdparty/nqp-configure/lib/NQP/Config.pm line 34.

[13:21] <vrurg> nine: Can you update submodule or run Configure && git pull?

[13:21] *** lucasb joined
[13:21] <vrurg> It's due to a recent change by patrickb and happens if submodule is not new.

[13:24] <vrurg> Or wipe nqp dir if nqp build is initiated by rakudo build.

[15:03] <nine> vrurg: submodule update seems to have fixed it. Thanks!

[15:03] <nine> Why doesn't it do that automatically?

[15:04] <vrurg> It does. You just didn't run Configure for long on that setup.

[15:05] <nine> m: say $*PERL.compiler.version

[15:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6f8442ada: OUTPUT: «v2019.03.1.624.g.6.f.8442.ada␤»

[15:05] <nine> But if it depends on me running Configure.pl it's not really automatic, isn't it?

[15:06] <vrurg> nine: Just once, to let Configure set git's submodules.recurse 

[15:07] <vrurg> After that every git pull will update

[15:07] <nine> Also it looks like camelia's build script does run Configure

[15:08] <nine> https://github.com/perl6/evalbot/blob/master/build-scripts/rebuild-rakudo-moar.pl#L56

[15:11] <vrurg> Hard to say. Unless somehow submodule.recurse gets reset in between, should be ok. I mean, it could fail once but should do right on next iteration.

[15:12] <nine> I guess we'll find out ;)

[15:12] <vrurg> Nah, ignore! Rakudo will be ok, but nqp – unlikely. 

[15:13] <vrurg> Don't remember if git clean -xdf cleans up subdirs too? Because if it don't then nqp wouldn't have its configure run.

[15:15] <vrurg> "If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed" – so, nqp dir is left alone. Perhaps we need a kind of --force key to re-run nqp/moar configures forcingly when needed.

[15:21] <vrurg> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2993 – do we really need release-number and codename attributes in Compiler class?

[16:13] <timotimo> i seem to recall we spoke about this at some point in the past, but does anybody know what "nqpevent" is for? it's in the HLL compiler, passing --nqpevent=blah will put it in the adverbs, and the backend class has a nqpevent method that is passed whatever positionals (but not nameds?) the compiler's nqpevent method is called with

[20:57] <bartolin> yes (see the other output from bisectable6 above :))

[20:58] <lizmat> sorry...  was still looking at the initial report

[21:02] <bartolin> hmm, well, that travis failure is not related to my change. it looks like it was build within the few minutes that nqp HEAD was broken.

[21:03] <lizmat> Geth has been awol for a few days already  :-(

[21:03] <lizmat> nobody seems to care :-(

[21:04] <bartolin> but he is back now!

[21:04] <lizmat> aaah...

[21:04] * lizmat is probably too tired to do this sort of thjng

[21:04] <lizmat> or too distracted doing the P6W

[21:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[21:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Maybe "new-from-daycount" should become a multi, that also takes

[21:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: instance objects to create new objects from?  At least this fixes

[21:08] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: a very clear execution error.

[21:09] <timotimo> thanks for picking up after me, lizmat++

[21:13] <MasterDuke> lizmat: can you share a repro for that busted profile you showed me a little while ago?

[21:15] <timotimo> any reason to make the proto for new-from-daycount any more specific than (|) {*}?

[21:16] <lizmat> introspection ?

[21:27] <timotimo> i mean if i constrain it to "exactly one positional" or constrain the return type, it'll reduce what end users can extend it for

[21:29] <lizmat> timotimo: that's a dilemma that applies to many subs in the core.. at one point we changed the proto's of a lot of subs for that reason

[21:29] <timotimo> what direction did we change them in?

[21:29] <lizmat> from (|) to ($,$) e.g.

[21:33] <timotimo> ah, ok, so i'll make it ($)
