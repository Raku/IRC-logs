[00:01] <vrurg> Does moar build with MS CL compiler? 

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> omg, .ps, .xml and .pdf files

[00:05] <ugexe> yes, you can look at the appveyor results to verify

[00:06] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: ok, so here's a crazy idea

[00:09] <vrurg> Reasonable... But mine fails under msvc developer command line.

[00:09] <vrurg> Can't build dll.

[00:09] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: yes?

[00:11] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: here, I grepped 9999 from my .bash_history: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/c801ddec74c676353367aec1d6466e56

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: run it with rakudos before and after your change, and diff the difference

[00:12] <MasterDuke> cool, i can do that

[00:13] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure if this history file is old enough to contain some neat test cases

[00:13] <AlexDaniel> but it's something

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: maybe replace /usr/bin/perl6 with perl6

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> there are just a few lines but they're on point

[00:22] <ugexe> vrurg: have you tried follow step by step with the appveyor file? are you doing https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/d5044de2f7c2101ae6a24da8263ce8e1bd41dc81/appveyor.yml#L47 for instance?

[00:24] <vrurg> ugexe: No. Just tried vanilla installation. Will checkit out. Though what's confuses me is that linker dies with internal error.

[00:24] <ugexe> because you need to do this with non-vanilla prompt

[00:24] <vrurg> ugexe: Thanks, I'll check it.

[00:24] <ugexe> or run that line above

[00:26] <vrurg> ugexe: I don't have SetEnv in SDKs path. 

[00:26] <AlexDaniel> heh and nobody is going to comment why I have 1461 lines like this in my bash history xD Thank you

[00:27] * vrurg didn't work in windows for at least 8 years. Hope it counts. ;)

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> 132589 lines in total, 5.4MB

[00:29] <ugexe> what visual studio do you have installed?

[00:30] <ugexe> x64 Native Tools Command Prompt -- do a search to see if you have this

[00:30] <vrurg> ugexe: VS 2019

[00:32] <vrurg> Perhaps I haven't installed the component. The search comes up with nothing.

[00:33] <ugexe> sounds like during installation you did not install/check some component then

[00:33] <ugexe> windows SDK maybe

[00:33] <vrurg> Oops, sorry! It's what I'm using to compile it actually. ;)

[00:34] <vrurg> Aha, I was about to check for SDK. Thanks!

[00:34] <ugexe> alternatively anything that has 'tools' listed with it that seems appropriate (i cant find a listing of components)

[00:38] <vrurg> ugexe: Thank you! Unfortunately, it's time to go now.

[11:50] *** pmurias left
[11:56] <jnthn> Yeah, the attrinit'd mechanism boils down to "did this thing get touched"

[11:57] <jnthn> Which vivifies the attribute as a side-effect

[11:57] <jnthn> This doesn't really work for native attributes, but also frustrates optimizations

[11:57] <jnthn> Thing is, I'm not sure quite what the alternative would be that causes little enough fallout

[11:58] <jnthn> I've pondered static analyses (does BUILD mention the attribute), but those will break anything that relied on conditionally using it

[11:59] <lizmat> perhaps a bitmap with a bit to indicate whether that attribute has been initialized ?

[12:00] <lizmat> eh... scratch that thought  

[12:00] <jnthn> maybe, but 1) need's storage for the object's lifetime (maybe reasonable as in "if you want the feature you pay for it"), 2) needs carefully defined semantics for when we set it

[12:01] *** pmurias joined

[12:10] <timotimo> use the minimum allowed even for +Inf?

[12:14] *** pmurias left
[12:18] <Kaiepi> this is to match the behaviour of javascript and ruby timotimo 

[12:19] <Kaiepi> i think it makes more sense to run the block in .cue asap on Inf instead of waiting as long as possible

[12:19] <Kaiepi> since it's not a number

[12:20] <timotimo> do we really hold up javascript as a positive example? :D

[12:21] <jnthn> No, and I'm dubious about this one :)

[12:22] <jnthn> Inf *is* a number, it's NaN that's not a number :P

[12:22] <lizmat> so what should we do then...

[12:22] <lizmat> FWIW, it's spectest clean

[12:22] <timotimo> not put it in the queue

[12:22] <timotimo> alternatively, put it in an atexit queue, lol

[12:22] <jnthn> -Inf doing ASAP makes sense to me; it's just another case of a negative number meaning "shoulda done it already"

[12:23] <jnthn> Just becasue something is spectest clean doesn't excuse you from thinking :P

[12:23] <jnthn> I think Inf or NaN are probably mistakes

[12:23] <jnthn> But I'd expect Inf to mean "don't ever do it" if we are going to support it

[12:24] <jnthn> I can sort of see the use of it if you're calculating the time to do soemthing and if the answer is "never" you just return Inf

[12:24] <jnthn> And that goes in as the time to do it, and we drop it

[12:24] <jnthn> Treating Inf as "now" feels wrong

[12:25] <jnthn> So I'd say: -Inf = right away like all negatives, Inf = just drop it, NaN = an error

[12:26] <timotimo> n'an error

[12:26] <lizmat> Kaiepi: will you do the honours of another PR ?

[12:26] <Kaiepi> once i can actually get perl6 running to test, sure

[12:27] <lizmat> ++Kaiepi

[12:28] <jnthn> The -Inf/Inf I'm quite sure of there; the NaN one I'm open to alternatives if anyone has a good argument for something other than error.

[12:28] <jnthn> Error is conservative, anyway.

[13:52] <Kaiepi> after that just follow the intructions and ping me once you're done

[13:52] <patrickb> there is only one set called bsd.rd

[13:52] <patrickb> is that correct?

[13:52] <Kaiepi> uhhhhhhh

[13:52] <Kaiepi> no

[13:53] <Kaiepi> there should be bsd, bsd.rd, bsd.mp, base65, etc.

[13:54] <patrickb> It also said: "Unable to get a verified list of distribution sets"

[13:54] <Kaiepi> what did you type in as the mirror?

[13:54] <patrickb> mirror.hs-esslingen.de

[13:54] <patrickb> I double checked mirror and server dir. They seem ok

[13:55] <patrickb> the dir on the server looks unsuspicious from what I can see in a browser...

[13:55] <Kaiepi> you'll probably have to cancel, reboot, download bsd.rd from https://mirror.hs-esslingen.de/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/bsd.rd and replace /bsd.rd with it

[13:55] <Kaiepi> then start over

[13:55] <patrickb> will do

[13:57] <Kaiepi> btw did any network interfaces pop up in the blue messages? there should be one with something like em0 for your network interface that should've gotten set up before the prompt to get the files from http or disk

[14:01] <patrickb> got it working. Downloading sets now.

[14:01] <patrickb> I think replacing the bsd.rd did the trick

[14:33] <Kaiepi> --no-relocatable also didn't work when i tested but i'm in the middle of working on stuff atm

[14:33] <patrickb> I'll have a look at that.

[14:34] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: hmm… you can probably remove all of them if they hang without your changes

[14:35] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: note that some of these can eat quite a bit of memory, too

[15:14] <patrickb> It does work in my VM.

[15:15] <Kaiepi> ok

[15:16] <Kaiepi> m: use nqp; say nqp::iseq_n(nqp::unbox_n(NaN), nqp::nan())

[15:16] <Kaiepi> how do i check if something is NaN with nqp?

[15:18] <Kaiepi> m: use nqp; my num $nan = nqp::nan(); nqp::iseq_s($nan, NaN)

[15:19] *** squashable6 joined
[15:21] <Kaiepi> guess i'll check it last out of Inf/-Inf/NaN and use nqp::isnanorinf

[15:26] <ugexe> yeah that seems to be the way: nqp::isnanorinf($n) && $n != nqp::inf() && $n != nqp::neginf();

[16:02] <b2gills> ugexe: It could be that `make test` works before `make install` only if there isn't already an installed Rakudo/NQP/MoarVM. Meaning the installed version of one (or more) of those takes precedence over the one that was just built. I did have this problem immediately after the relocatable stuff was merged.

[16:11] <b2gills> Actually thinking about it, the way I build and install; the installed Rakudo may be in a borked state until it fully completes. (Which should be fine) I build and install MoarVM, then build/test/install NQP, then do the same for Rakudo. I do all of that without removing the previously installed files.

[16:11] <b2gills> Anything that (incorrectly) uses the installed Rakudo may fail if it runs before the build script is done.

[19:41] <ugexe> i think sprintf errors are usually LTA because they go through nqp?

[19:42] <lizmat> I guess

[19:42] <lizmat> I'm currently rewriting sprintf in Perl 6, and found that wart  :-)
