[07:39] <nine> .tell Zoffix I have wished so often that authors would explain, why I should use their module and not one of the older alternatives. Maybe it just has features I don't actually need. Maybe it works on platforms that I don't care about. Maybe the author just likes a different interface. And maybe the older is as horrible as File::Temp...

[07:39] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[10:55] <jnthn> With that, Proc::Async should have all the features that Proc does :)

[10:55] <jnthn> Well, except working on the JVM also

[10:55] <jnthn> Which I guess is my next task :)

[10:55] <Zoffix> \o/

[10:56] <jnthn> And when that's done, Proc can be re-worked to use Proc::Async

[10:57] <jnthn> Pre-comp should probably switch to using Proc::Async instead of Proc too along the way, since that'll be cheaper

[10:57] <jnthn> (Than going through the extra layer of wrapper)

[10:57] <jnthn> And also resolve the various occasional hangs

[10:57] <jnthn> Lunch time now :)

[10:59] <nine> jnthn: I've had hopes to move precompilation into the calling process. But that seems to be an endless can of worms...

[11:00] <jnthn> nine: I can only imagine...

[11:01] <jnthn> nine: We only ever spawn the subprocess when we have to compile something, though? When everything is already pre-comp'd, we never have to?

[11:02] <timotimo> jnthn: i wish there was no performance hit to starting the async eventloop :<

[11:03] <jnthn> timotimo: It's dwarfed by the startup time and work done by the subprocess anyway :)

[11:03] * jnthn bbiab

[11:03] <timotimo> no, i mean the global performance hit

[11:04] <timotimo> though to be fair i last measured that before the fsa rework

[11:04] <timotimo> but i think many places still turn on locking mechanisms when an extra thread exists

[11:05] <nine> jnthn: yep, we only spawn the process for compilation. So it's not that bad, but still causes the mentioned hangs, makes supporting custom repo implementations much harder than it should be, screws gdb sessions and a couple other issues

[11:05] <nine> Well, at least now I remember why I put so much time into this :)

[11:05] <jnthn> I'll get rid of the hangs for you :)

[11:05] <jnthn> Since they're from the lack of async

[11:06] <nine> That's gonna be a very welcome fix :)

[12:18] <Zoffix> That's normal.

[16:01] <jnthn> It can't DWIM

[16:01] <jnthn> And it parses fine because but is an infix

[16:01] <lizmat> silently creating a copy and then .STOREing in that, feels wrong

[22:22] <eveo> Can't tell if Gábor is just super productive or horribly optimistic. A book by december sounds ambitious by itself. Basing it on Bailador while improving it, feels too much.

[22:29] <timotimo> that's very ambitious
