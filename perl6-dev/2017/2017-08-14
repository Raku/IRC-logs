[09:48] <nine> Killing extops? I'd like that. They never made sense to me considering that MoarVM was explicitly written to run rakudo :)

[09:49] <jnthn> They're largely "things we didn't have time to design right in the VM, so exported the technical debt" :)

[09:49] <jnthn> (Yes, I'd like to see them go. No, I don't care to do it by just moving them.)

[10:06] <brrt> what would you recommend we'd need for them to go?

[10:08] <jnthn> Well, step 1 is probably to re-design the stuff that underpins Scalar

[10:08] <jnthn> Which we need to do for spesh to better understand it anyway

[10:08] <brrt> hmmm

[10:08] <jnthn> Once *that* is moved into MoarVM at least a few ops will go away

[10:09] <jnthn> The p6box_i, p6box_s etc. can easily go today

[10:09] <jnthn> Anyone can do that

[10:09] <jnthn> We "just" need to turn them into a wval + box instruction

[10:09] <jnthn> Or perhaps a hllboxtype_i + box

[10:10] <jnthn> That probably just leaves a small number of things

[10:10] <brrt> uhuh

[11:56] <dogbert17_> ZOFFLOP: S03-junctions/autothreading.t, S05-modifier/ignoremark.t, S05-modifier/samemark.t, S17-promise/nonblocking-await.t, S32-io/IO-Socket-Async.t and S32-io/IO-Socket-INET.t

[13:05] <jnthn> So I'm putting in various atomic ops and pondering exactly how we'll expose them at Perl 6 level.

[13:06] <jnthn> A cas function is fine enough and we can overload it for Scalar and int

[13:06] <jnthn> Question beyond that is if we'd prefer an interface like Atomic.something(...) or a more functional interface

[13:07] <timotimo> just can't be bigint ... or immutable Int :P

[13:07] <jnthn> Right, has to be an `int $target is rw`

[13:08] <jnthn> m: multi m(int $target is rw) { say "int" }; multi m($x is rw) { say "reference" }; my int $test = 42; m($test); my $test2 = Mu; m($test2)

[13:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3c71e: OUTPUT: «int?Cannot resolve caller m(Mu); none of these signatures match:?    (int $target is rw)?    ($x is rw)?  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1??»

[13:08] <jnthn> oops

[13:08] <jnthn> m: multi m(int $target is rw) { say "int" }; multi m($x is rw) { say "reference" }; my int $test = 42; m($test); my $test2 = Any; m($test2)

[13:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3c71e: OUTPUT: «int?reference?»

[13:09] <jnthn> m: multi m(int $target is rw) { say "int" }; multi m($x is rw) { say "reference" }; my int $test = 42; m($test); my $test2 = 42; m($test2)

[13:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3c71e: OUTPUT: «int?reference?»

[13:09] <jnthn> So those fall fine out of multi

[13:09] <jnthn> The other operations on scalars are atomic load and atomic store

[13:09] <jnthn> The other opreations on native int are atomic increment, decrement, add, load, and store

[13:10] <timotimo> ah, scalars will also store and load actual objects

[13:10] <jnthn> There's then an argument-less memory barrier

[13:10] <jnthn> The boring answer is just Atomic.add($i, 42)

[13:10] <jnthn> Atomic.full-barrier()

[13:10] <jnthn> etc.

[13:10] <timotimo> Atomic+ Atomic- :P

[13:11] <timotimo> is this anything to do with making object hashes perl6-level and making them threadsafe?

[13:11] <timotimo> or your latest secret project?

[13:11] <jnthn> But...well yeah, we can do horrors like $x A= $obj

[13:11] <jnthn> :P

[13:11] <timotimo> we do have the S metaop for "sequential" or something

[13:11] <timotimo> that's sort of what you get when you use atomic ops

[13:11] <jnthn> No, it's to do with somebody offering me funding to implement atomics :-)

[13:12] <timotimo> oh, cool

[13:12] <timotimo> .o( now in theaters: Atomic Jonthe )

[13:12] <jnthn> :P

[13:12] <jnthn> Wait, what secret project? :P :P Just 'cus I've got my first talk in ages coming up doesn't mean there'll be a big reveal :P

[13:13] <timotimo> :D

[13:13] <jnthn> Or at least, it doesn't *have* to... ;-)

[13:13] <timotimo> no pressure

[13:13] <jnthn> I pondered some atomic-y meta-op

[13:13] <jnthn> But it seems pretty poor generalization

[13:13] <timotimo> very

[13:14] <timotimo> i mean, it could be like += but instead of "assigning" it'll compare-and-swap in a loop or something?!

[13:14] <jnthn> We'd have to pick a non-ascii char for it too

[13:14] <jnthn> += can't fail

[13:14] <jnthn> There's a direct atomic add

[13:14] <jnthn> So no implicit loop there

[13:14] <timotimo> bad example, indeed

[13:14] <jnthn> I think cas just wants to be a function

[13:14] <timotimo> A.= lc

[13:15] <jnthn> Yeah but ++ and -- are the other ones

[13:15] <jnthn> And you can't A++ and A-- 'cus it'd have to be written $foo\A++ to not be ambiguous anyway

[13:15] <timotimo> indeed, that'd be ugly

[13:15] <jnthn> And then it'd only work on a native int of the right size :P

[13:15] <timotimo> +A+ -A- *ugh*

[13:15] <jnthn> eww :P

[13:16] <jnthn> ++A and --A and =A and +=A would work but...uh... )

[13:16] <timotimo> except we also have pre-increment

[13:16] <timotimo> though i believe the increment and decrement atomic ops give you the before value already

[13:16] <jnthn> Not natively but yeah, we can simulate it

[13:16] <jnthn> Right

[13:17] <jnthn> I think I'll go the boring route for now

[13:17] <timotimo> that'll be acceptable

[13:17] <jnthn> There are pretty special case anyway

[13:17] <jnthn> Argubably they could just be functions

[13:17] <jnthn> Not Atomic.blah

[13:17] <jnthn> Since cas already is

[14:24] <pmurias> jnthn: are $a.=repeated and $a .= repeated meant to compile differently?

[14:25] <pmurias> jnthn: $a.=repeated has a sink when compiled while $a .= repeated doesn't

[14:30] <jnthn> They're parsed very differently

[14:31] <jnthn> The first is parsed as a method call, like .+ and .* are

[14:31] <jnthn> The latter as an infix op

[14:31] <pmurias> both are intended to have identical semantics?

[14:31] <jnthn> Yeah

[14:31] <jnthn> Not sure what stops the latter one getting the sink

[14:31] <jnthn> Oh

[14:31] <jnthn> Maybe the problem is the former does get the sink though

[14:31] <jnthn> Yeah, it's an assignment

[14:32] <jnthn> And assignments shouldn't be sunk

[14:33] <pmurias> the sink is somehow called only on the JVM/JS backends

[14:33] <pmurias> I'll debug that

[16:41] <yoleaux> I saw perlpilot 2 Aug 2017 17:52Z in #perl6: <perlpilot> Altreus: gist works

[17:59] <nine> jnthn: functions are much easier to replace in a lexical scope, i.e. a new language version. So when in doubt about an API, functions are a less risky way.

[18:16] <samcv> AlexDaniel, that RT is probably not caused by me. i made changes which fixed a bug in ignoremark

[18:16] <samcv> ignoremark used to match if the first two codepoints in the needle were a match (no matter what else was in the needle)

[18:16] <samcv> so 'hello' ~~ /:m hem/ would match

[18:16] <samcv> i will reply to the RT after i make some tea

[18:17] <samcv> RT if anyone curious https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131881

[18:18] <samcv> though i maybe commited some other fixes that i will have to check

[18:24] <samcv> ah no i haven't made a fix another location yet. not sure if it will fix this. it is possible? i will see in a bit.

[18:24] <samcv> tea &

[18:27] <jnthn> nine: Good point, though in this case I'd expect it to be relatively low-risk; this is epxosing rather well-defined primitives. :)

[18:28] <jnthn> But yeah, I guess functions are more natural than methods always called on a type object

[18:50] <pmurias> function calls are easier to optimize too

[18:54] <jnthn> That also

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> this one is right

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> the memory issue thing… I just tested it. It got better, but it's still leaking

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> let's see if I can reproduce the leak with the provided example…

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I can. But it's less severe

[21:35] <samcv> is it a really bad memory leak? (is/was?)

[21:36] <AlexDaniel> it was horrible, yes. Currently not that much

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> in fact, I'm not sure if it was perfectly clean before it got worse

[21:41] <samcv> hm
