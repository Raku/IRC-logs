[00:06] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev!

[00:49] * Zoffix commits to remaking the entire Introducing Perl 6 brochure

[00:50] <Zoffix> Took me half a year to realize I don't have to use $work's tiny laptop to work remotely and instead can remote-desktop into it from my desktop with giant monitor. So I now have proper hardware for design software when I'm hope :P

[00:50] <timotimo> oh, nice

[00:51] <timotimo> but what's wrong about inkscape!!! (lol omg)

[00:52] <Zoffix> No idea. Never used it. Out of free tools, I've used Scribus 5 years ago and it kept crashing.

[00:53] <Zoffix> Or making 1GB PDFs :)

[00:53] <timotimo> fair enough

[00:53] <timotimo> inkscape's UI has been in desperate need of a new UI for a long long time

[00:53] <timotimo> there are people capable of doing spectacular things with it, of course

[01:42] <samcv> good * everybody

[01:50] <timotimo> yo samcv

[01:50] <samcv> hey

[01:51] <samcv> timotimo, what do you think of a function for composing ropes. that we could use in concatenation and other functions. so you initialize an MVMstruct for the string, and the ncall a function to add strands onto it. where would that be a good place to use other than join and concatenation functions? anywhere else where that would be benefictial?

[01:53] <timotimo> if you include repetitions, then the x operator maybe?

[01:59] <samcv> well. we're not talking about the x operator

[02:00] <timotimo> other than that i have no good ideas

[02:02] <samcv> https://gist.github.com/samcv/5c2eb18fa5d4d428c081ab3e8bca8fc4 something like this

[02:02] <samcv> a mvm function that would let us easily compose ropes

[02:03] <timotimo> i can see the appeal

[02:04] <samcv> one of the things i noticed is it's not trivial to compose ropes. we have concatenation but nothing else really does it. so i'm thinking if i have enough reasons for doing this

[02:04] <samcv> it may be worth it to add these functions

[02:07] <samcv> i'm basically asking someone to convince me i should do this :)

[02:12] <timotimo> the code looks good. it'll probably come out the same after gcc throws all its optimizations at it, but it's likely less error-prone

[02:18] <timotimo> i'm going to bed, seeya!

[02:34] <Zoffix> Man, I'm feeling the pain with all our Unicode ops and Unicode in outpout (e.g ｢｣). Even Noto font doesn't render them in InDesign; looks like whatever fallback mechanism usually exist doesn't work in typesetting software :(

[02:37] <Zoffix> Finally managed to typeset this snippet with 3 fonts :P https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/a4f23c4c647feaadbbe9ded22f514f5a

[02:39] <Zoffix> Doesn't quite work still, 'cause I wanted to highlight it but can't apply two char styles together :|

[07:34] <bartolin> samcv: it looks like we have a regression with some tests for "\c[BELL]" on jvm. I think that might be related to your recent work on control characters (nqp commit 7954f9b0c1).

[07:34] <bartolin> m: say "\c[BELL]".uniname  # gives <control-0007> on jvm

[07:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar d21c31e1d: OUTPUT: «BELL␤»

[07:35] <bartolin> samcv: I believe that happens because nqp::ord("\c[BELL]") returns 7 on jvm

[07:36] <bartolin> samcv: do you have a pointer, perhaps, how "\c[BELL]" is processed?

[07:40] <bartolin> samcv: I've read through RT #130542 and if I understood correctly, BELL is a special case, because it was U+0007 in Unicode 1. So, maybe we need to add a correcsponding special case somewhere. (I saw that you already did that for nqp::codepointfromname in nqp commit deb8cb03e.)

[16:10] <Zoffix> Nope. I'm not sure where the code is at even. Probably can be improved a bit and shared with all the authors.

[16:21] <Zoffix> So yesterday I was whinging because there wasn't an easy way to style code parts in InDesign to have syntax highlights. Turns out it supports PCRE in paragraph styles to apply substyles. And a bunch of regex hackery later, I managed to make a single paragraph style that reasonably-well highlights Perl 6 code up in it: https://i.imgur.com/1GsZsBZ.png

[16:21] <Zoffix> Not that anyone here cares about InDesign, but it'll make creating marketing brochures with code about 1000x faster :)

[16:24] <timotimo> the other day i was trying something with List

[16:25] <timotimo> the reason why i even started trying the nqp::attrinited stuff on List was that $!todo.DEFINITE will autovivify a Scalar container even for a List object that'll never have (and never had) an iterator part

[16:26] <timotimo> so this is perhaps an opportunity for improvement. though maybe we actually want to do this in the optimizer

[16:38] <lizmat> hmmm... good one

[16:38] <timotimo> okay, so ...

[16:38] <timotimo> i outputted every "demanded" object and stable with Telemetry vs Telemetry :COLUMNS

[16:39] <timotimo> and with :COLUMNS it's actually fewer things in there

[17:14] <jnthn> Urgh, a bug I've been hunting for the last few hours might boil down to something wrong with the CLOSE phaser

[17:16] <lizmat> whee

[17:17] <lizmat> also: if you can't start another thread, should we act on that somehow more than just ignoring ?

[17:18] <jnthn> In what sense?

[17:18] <jnthn> Thread.start explodes pretty forcefully, and perhaps too much so, if it fails

[17:19] <jnthn> (It's a VM panic)

[17:19] <lizmat> m: await start { sleep 1 } xx 64; say T.general-workers  # never goes beyond 47 for me

[17:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared name:␤    T used at line 1␤␤»

[17:19] <lizmat> m: use Telemetry; await start { sleep 1 } xx 64; say T.general-workers  # never goes beyond 47 for me

[17:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Could not spawn thread: errorcode -11␤»

[17:19] <lizmat> ooh wow

[17:19] <jnthn> That's 'cus of limits in the environment camelia runs under

[17:19] <lizmat> on MacOS it just says 47

[17:20] <lizmat> if run with RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG, I get a lot of: Heuristic queue progress deadlock situation detected

[17:20] <lizmat> followed by Could not create a new Thread: too many open files

[17:20] <jnthn> Ah

[17:20] <jnthn> Well, I think it's probably doing the right thing

[17:21] <jnthn> No reason to bring down a program that will eventually work

[17:21] <jnthn> Instead of leaving it to complete

[17:24] <Zoffix> I still get "too many open files" even if I set RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=10

[17:25] <ilmari> what does 'ulimit -n' output?

[17:26] <Zoffix> hm, nm, setting it to 7 does go through the "max threads reached" message.

[17:26] <perlpilot> "too many open files" is a strange way to say ENOMORETHREADS

[17:26] <Zoffix> ilmari: I set it to 50

[17:26] <Zoffix> But I guess there are other things using files, so the left over is 7 for threads :)

[17:26] <jnthn> perlpilot: Probably really means "handles"

[17:29] <tbrowder> Zoffix: I have a copy of your md2html from last year. It's at github gist: https://gist.github.com/tbrowder/32154ec024d1d36003e84358fd4823d8, plus my code wrapping it for my md source. Both are at gist

[17:30] <tbrowder> ignore words after the gist, please

[17:33] <Zoffix> m: await start { sleep 1 } xx 30

[17:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Could not spawn thread: errorcode -11␤»

[17:33] <Zoffix> So what limitations does camelia's env have? I set all the same ulimit values (a few days ago) and didn't have that issue locally.

[17:35] <Zoffix> It's kind'f an unwanted issue IMO. The work can be done on a couple of threads really and the program I wrote that works elsewhere crashes here for reasons I don't know.

[17:35] <Zoffix> (this also didn't exist in 2017.08)

[17:35] <Zoffix> *.07

[17:35] <Zoffix> star: await start { sleep 1 } xx 30

[17:35] <camelia> star-m 2017.07: ( no output )

[17:36] <jnthn> Then set RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=16 and you'll have the 2017.07 max pool size back

[17:36] <Zoffix> m: BEGIN %*ENV<RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS> = 16; await start { sleep 1 } xx 30

[17:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Could not spawn thread: errorcode -11␤»

[17:37] <jnthn> I think it actually has to be in the env

[17:37] <Zoffix> m: BEGIN %*ENV<RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS> = 2; await start { sleep 1 } xx 30

[17:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: OUTPUT: «MoarVM panic: Could not spawn thread: errorcode -11␤»

[17:37] <jnthn> As the scheduler instance is created at CORE.setting load time

[17:37] <Zoffix> 2 just worked in #zofbot

[17:38] <jnthn> Can perhaps also look into whether the panic can be turned into a throw

[17:38] <jnthn> In which case the sueprvisor will be able to silently swallow it

[17:38] <Zoffix> m: use nqp; nqp::bindattr(nqp::decont($*SCHEDULER), ThreadPoolScheduler, q|$!max_threads|, 16);  await start { sleep 1 } xx 30

[17:38] <jnthn> Just needs some care to make sure that we don't end up with a corrupt internal VM state as a result

[17:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar e1a1b8d86: ( no output )

[17:38] <Zoffix> k, yeah, works with 16

[17:39] <jnthn> Which may be why it's a panic now

[17:40] <jnthn> Looking very much like the CLOSE phaser bug was the root cause of the problem I was hunting. Thankfully this case is trivial to rewrite in terms of .on-close, which is safe

[17:41] <jnthn> I'll file an issue later, or mebbe tomorrow

[17:48] <jnthn> Phew. That was some debugging. But, we'll get Cro 0.7.1 this week (or weekend) thanks to it. :)
