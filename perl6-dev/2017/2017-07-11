[12:05] <stmuk_> can anyone remember the url to the output of the processes which create examples.perl6.org? I think it's on p6c.org but don't seem to have it bookmarked

[12:08] <timotimo> it's in a subfolder named "build-log", but i can't reach it via http

[12:08] <timotimo> oh

[12:09] <timotimo> my mistake, it's examples.perl6.org not examples.p6c.org

[12:09] <stmuk_> moritz++

[12:15] <Zoffix> lizmat: ask moritz for keys to the account? :)

[12:16] <moritz> which account?

[12:16] <Zoffix> I see past weeklies were retweets from me but this week I did not use #Perl6 tag, so it probably wasnt in the @perl6org's feed

[12:16] <Zoffix> moritz: "* │ lizmat wonders why a new issue of the Perl 6 Weekly is not worthy of a @perl6org tweet anymore"

[12:16] <moritz> oh sorry, just being busy

[12:16] <Zoffix> :)

[12:19] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel, from what I recall while experimenting with ufobat's example, ealier rakudos .kill just fine. Also, the tree dies if you send kill yourself outside of Rakudo. So it's some kind of regression. Keep in mind there was one more bug that may have contributed to your code's comments: accessing list of signals (as kill does) wasn't thread safe and created a race where signal table was busted

[12:21] <moritz> that said, I'd gladly give somebody else access to the perl6org twitter account

[12:24] <lizmat> feels to me I shouldn't be at all Perl 6 knobs  :-)

[12:25] * Zoffix thinks lizmat should get the Twitter knob :)

[12:25] <lizmat> so if I have a sub a(|) {} , is there a way to pass on all parameters to another sub/method ?

[12:25] <moritz> not really

[12:25] <lizmat> other than doing (|c) ?

[12:26] <lizmat> I mean, proto's can  :-)

[12:26] <moritz> and {next,call}same too

[12:26] <lizmat> indeed  :-)

[12:26] <Zoffix> some p6 op?

[12:26] <Zoffix> nqp::p6* I mean

[12:27] <lizmat> yeah, that's the question

[12:27] <moritz> I think there is, yes

[12:27] <Zoffix> m: use nqp; sub a(|) { dd nqp::p6argvmarray }; a <a b c>, 42, :70meow

[12:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 83e157: OUTPUT: «(("a", "b", "c"), 42)␤»

[12:28] <lizmat> hmmm.. pass nqp::p6argvmarray ?

[12:28] <lizmat> not interested in names

[12:28] <lizmat> nameds atm

[12:32] <lizmat> ah, duh, can't work

[12:32] <lizmat> because self is part of the parameter list, and that changes with the call to a method

[12:46] <timotimo> are takecapture and usecapture usable from perl6 code, or will they be messed up by existing signature binding code we generate?

[13:20] <lizmat> ok, so I can make say() and put() about 10% faster

[13:20] <lizmat> *but* it will break a lot of spectest that expect say() internally calles $*OUT.print

[13:21] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/58900e7ba8

[13:24] <lizmat> the gain is mostly caused by not needing to find out the nl-out using a method call, but inside IO::Handle directly accessing the private attribute

[13:25] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/a8c06dd75f07d15013735c71e4fabf11  # the diff in question

[13:26] <Zoffix> Are those spectests part of 6.c or just something that was added later? IMO the tests should not make any assumptions on what methods say() and put() use. Just that they use $*OUT handle for output.

[13:26] <lizmat> FWIW, for interface consistency, I believe that say() *should* call $*OUT.say

[13:26] * lizmat checks

[13:27] <lizmat> S16-io/note.t predates 6.c  (August 2015)

[13:30] * Zoffix would argue that test assumes too much about internal implementation

[13:32] <lizmat> well, t/spec/S16-io/say.t has the same issue

[13:32] <Zoffix> If it were at least using print(), you could argue there's an expectation that &print call maps to .print call, but &note -> .print ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  even .say is a closer match

[13:33] <lizmat> and several advent post tests

[13:33] <lizmat> e.g. integration/advent2009-day07.t

[13:33] <lizmat> this all got triggered by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45024570/how-could-i-subclass-perl-6s-iohandle

[13:33] <Zoffix> Same deal with S16-io/say.t. The writer of the test let their knowledge of internal implementation of IO::Handle seep into the test

[13:34] <Zoffix> lizmat: oh, the correct Bleed Rakudo answer is override .write-internal and .read-internal methods

[13:34] <Zoffix> Though I'm unsure if jnthn++ decided they are good to be the final names for the methods

[13:35] <lizmat> well, that's it: if you provide your own .say / .put / .print / .note methods, the interface is clear

[13:35] <Zoffix> And I don't think they're tested/implemented yet

[13:35] <lizmat> write-internal feels to me as something that's internal  :-)

[13:35] <Zoffix> We had a lot of ecosystem breakage because people were assuming exactly what these tests assume that method X is implemented in terms of method Y

[13:36] <Zoffix> lizmat: yeah, the names were still up to bikeshedding, but the plan was that subclasses just need to override those and not worry what is implemented in terms of what

[13:36] <Zoffix> There's also .eof-iternal. The IO::Pipe interface shows the usage: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/IO/Pipe.pm#L25-L51

[13:37] <lizmat> still, if you just want to capture whatever is being "say"d, you don't need any of the internals

[13:38] <nine> But....if tests assume something and people assume the same thing because the tests assume that then that's how our specification works. Then in Perl 6 method X _is_ defined as an augmented call of method Y.

[13:38] <lizmat> you just need to know that your object needs to provide a "say" method if say() is done with $*OUT being set to your object

[13:39] <lizmat> maybe this is 6.d stuff

[13:40] <Zoffix> nine: you were the person who argued that doing so robs of crutial optimization opportunities

[13:40] <lizmat> anyways, I think 10% gain on say() would be worthwhile to have

[13:40] * lizmat goes back to fixing (<) on Mixes

[13:41] <nine> Zoffix: it does and that sucks :/ We do get away sometimes with correcting the tests (and thereby changing the spec) but if as you say the ecosystem actively relies on the tested behavior, that's a line that we may not want to cross.

[13:42] <Zoffix> No, the ecosystem issue did not rely on tested behaviour.

[13:43] <nine> This is a very hard topic. We did promise backwards compatibility with the published spec. And we're breaking that promise at every opportunity. Of course as a still young adult, we get away with a lot of that, but at some point we have to grow up and take things seriously.

[13:43] <nine> Zoffix: oh, I reacted to your "We had a lot of ecosystem breakage because people were assuming exactly what these tests assume"

[13:44] <Zoffix> s/exactly/similar/;

[13:44] <Zoffix> The assumption was .say was implemented in terms of .print IIRC

[13:44] <Zoffix> (and tests assum say() and note() are)

[13:46] <nine> If that assumption is made a lot, then that could show that assumption's usefulness.

[13:46] <nine> Maybe .say _should_ be specced as calling .print.

[13:47] <lizmat> then why does IO::Handle.say exist ?

[13:47] <nine> Note that I do know very little about all this IO stuff. I'm using those cases as arguments in a more general discussion about spec tests.

[13:47] <lizmat> well, I guess for those who actually do $*OUT.say

[13:48] <nine> The question would then be: what about optimization? That won't be as simple as it is now (write some optimized nqp code or whatever). But it would still be possible, e.g. via spesh.

[13:49] <Geth> ¦ 6.d-prep: review: https://github.com/perl6/6.d-prep/commit/33bbdf8c83

[13:49] <nine> spesh could still discover, that the code is running the standard case that will just call .print and use an even more optimized version instead.

[13:49] <lizmat> spesh is smart enough to notice $*OUT hasn't changed ?

[13:50] <nine> I'm fairly in hand waving territory right now :) But I guess it could be made smart enough to notice that, yes.

[13:50] <nine> Or some more general mechanism will lead to equally optimized code.

[13:51] <nine> The general mechanism could deal with dynamic variables (a pain point where we need to figure out optimization anyway) and how to detect that they do not change from one iteration of a loop to another.

[13:51] <nine> Maybe that's something spesh even already does, I have no idea.

[13:52] <nine> Spesh does recognize that some times are always the same. So it must have tracking infrastructure. And that may be repurposeable.

[13:53] <nine> MoarVM does already inline small methods, doesn't it? From there it's not far from inlining a call to a method on $*OUT.

[13:54] <nine> I guess my message is: not all hope is lost, even if we let people have their assumptions in some cases. We don't have to sacrifice all awesomeness to the performance god, like we don't compromise on having a real meta model either.

[13:54] <lizmat> well, even a small (and important) sub like &DYNAMIC doesn't get inlined because of it using nqp::getlexreldyn or so

[13:54] <lizmat> if &DYNAMIC could get inlined, all $*FOO accesses would benefit greatly

[13:54] <nine> lizmat: yes, that's a current restriction. But I wouldn't know a reason for this restriction to remain indefinitely.

[13:55] <lizmat> which includes say()

[13:55] <lizmat> I was under the impression that this was not fixable

[13:55] <nine> I'd be interested in the reason for that

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> well, SIGKILL cannot be trapped, so the process has no chance to clean up its children

[14:31] <pmurias> Ven``: the way the source maps are built will very likely change, as building them up from an array of offsets seem more efficient than creating a gigantic JSON string

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> so if you're doing .kill(9) on something, you are deliberately leaving its children alive

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> which is never what you mean, I think

[14:31] <Zoffix> Ah

[14:31] <Zoffix> And what's the correct signal to send?

[14:32] <AlexDaniel> well, the correct thing would be to kill the process group, which in perl 5 is done by negating the signal number… like -9

[14:32] <AlexDaniel> or you can do SIGTERM and *hope* that it will finish and terminate its children also

[14:32] <Zoffix> I'm using $proc.kill: SIGTERM; followed by $proc.kill: SIGSEGV; in toaster and there's a bunch of unkilled stuff remains

[14:38] <pmurias> bbl&

[14:39] <AlexDaniel> by the way, if anybody knows better about things I'm talking about, what would be the right way to kill a process group in rakudo? And should we support negative signal thingy in some way?

[14:41] <lizmat> isn't negative signal values a p5ism ?

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> yes-yes we don't have to do it the same way

[14:42] <lizmat> ok, *phew*  :-)

[14:42] <lizmat> afk for some cycling before it starts raining&

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> let it be a named param or whatever, and it could give a helpful error message if you try to give it a negative signal number

[15:35] <[Coke]> (malformed utf8) see https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1414

[15:42] <nine> FWIW both kill(2) and the kill shell command use negative signal numbers for denoting the process group: If pid is less than -1, then sig is sent to every process in the process group whose ID is -pid.

[15:43] <nine> Err...negative PID numbers, not signal numbers

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> signal numbers also

[15:44] <nine> Perl 5's kill supports negative PID numbers, too for process groups. If the OS does it that way that is. So the negative signal number is its OS independent way of killing a process group (though those do not exist on all systems anyway)

[15:47] <nine> AlexDaniel: POSIX man page for kill(1): "If the first argument is a negative integer, it shall be interpreted as a −signal_number option, not as a negative pid operand specifying a process group."

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> interestingly, right now rakudo accepts negative signal values

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> but it seems to do nothing with them

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> at least on moar…

[16:35] <Zoffix> oh, nmm

[16:39] <Zoffix> Told my trainee about Perl 6. He was suitably impressed :)

[16:40] <Zoffix> Though it was really stupid lead up: "This is written in Perl, though I don't like that lang anymore. If I could, I rewrite this in another lang." "What is it called?" "Umm... PERL 6!"

[16:40] <Zoffix> heh

[16:40] <timotimo> REPL 7

[17:00] <Zoffix> for rakudo.perl6.org, I'm gonna use a Perl 5 web app (after first trying to see if it can work as a Perl 5 CGI script). Don't want the manual process as that's a whole new step that needs to be done on each release and can be forgotten and cron isn't good either because during the release you push the tarballs and send announcement, but with cron you have to sit and wait for it to refresh the page before

[17:00] <Zoffix> you can send anything

[17:05] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/58c2d193b103de4810d91380739621c8 (windows precomp rename error with --ll-exception gives different error)

[17:05] <ugexe> (note this is *after* zef has been precompiled+working, and then I edited a file and rerun)

[17:16] <ugexe> the error goes away in 2017.04, and is present in 2017.05

[17:20] <Zoffix> But not in 2017.06? That looks very familiar to the issue we had on 2017.06 release and I thought we fixed it

[17:20] <Zoffix> Though I saw that error crop up on more recent Rakudo when precompiling files in lib/

[17:22] <Zoffix> "t/04-nativecall/06-struct.t .............. Failed 14/28 subtests"

[17:22] <Zoffix> flopper

[17:23] <ugexe> its in 2017.06 too

[17:24] <ugexe> but yeah, i thought this looked similar to what you fixed

[17:25] <ugexe> where it was precompiling multiple times or something

[17:25] <Zoffix> IIRC it was a "wtf" fix. Like removing the same nqp ops used by Str.subst and using Str.subst instead. Like no sense behind it but it appeared to fix stuff. I guess it didn't really

[17:26] <Zoffix> I'd say this is a release blocker,s ince R* will be based on this release

[17:26] <Zoffix> Oh

[17:26] <ugexe> im slowly bisecting the commit, but any hunches are welcome since building is slow

[17:26] <Zoffix> Maybe not that.

[17:27] <Zoffix> Ohhhh... now I remember. The fix for the thing was that newline translation was done in like IO::Handle.slurp but not in IO::Path.slurp so we ended up with different shas in different parts of the codebase and it thought the source changed

[17:27] <ugexe> ah, which then produced the current bug

[17:29] <ugexe> i think I got lucky... seems like it might be https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/ca0a74398b9385053c79de62a42418258905c715#diff-c97d8fc8b5978ba87f7f726ed9cc28a4

[17:31] <Zoffix> That sure fits into the picture that checksums don't match someplace

[17:31] <Zoffix> s: IO::Path, 'slurp'

[17:31] <SourceBaby> Zoffix, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/2eeb000/src/core/IO/Path.pm#L602

[17:31] <Zoffix> s: IO::Handle, 'slurp'

[17:31] <SourceBaby> Zoffix, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/2eeb000/src/core/IO/Handle.pm#L644

[17:32] <ugexe> well in this case the checksums *do* change (i edit a source file)

[17:32] <ugexe> so before, while the checksums didnt really change, rakudo thought they did and took the path we are debugging currently

[17:32] <Zoffix> Ah, I had the error without it. On first compilation it works, on second fails and I have to remove lib\.precomp

[17:33] <ugexe> likely that windows is holding a handle now somewhere we don't expect

[18:51] <nine> We never close the CompUnit::PrecompilationUnit::File's $!handle. I have no idea why that hasn't been an issue before. It just plain should not have worked.

[18:51] <nine> Well we close the .load'ed PrecompilationUnit, but not the dependencies in the case the is-up-to-date check fails

[18:52] <Zoffix> Ah cool.

[18:52] <nine> Here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/CompUnit/PrecompilationRepository.pm#L137

[19:04] <ugexe> it probably was, but went away somewhere along the line if the fact 2017.04 did not have this issue means anything

[19:50] <lizmat> nine: will try to remember  :-)

[19:50] <ugexe> open handles for procs can cause segfaults / no-message halting, so this could possible fix some of those as well

[19:51] <ugexe> although it'd have to be a pretty big dependency chain

[19:52] <nine> But this fix will only affect cases where a precompiled dependency is out of date.

[21:36] <samcv> as i have it now it does slow down concatting lots of unicode text when it's single codepoints i'm concatting all together. but that is unusual

[21:37] <samcv> it's more common there's going to be potentially a much longer string

[21:37] <samcv> instead of concatting like thousands of characters one at a time

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> What I don't like about all these name change/tweak ramblings is the approach. Whenever some name was suggested, ten other suggestions would pop up and (at least for me) it's unclear which one is better(and then we get more ramblings on how the proposed name is not good enough). Let's *assume* that at some point we manage to tweak or change the name, would we be getting “ah, name X would've been so much better” comments afterwards

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> Please no… So, if we are feeling at least a tiny bit serious about the whole question, and if we are ready to spend so much time on this beaten bikeshed, why not do the bikeshedding properly? Set up a page on rakudo wiki for brainstorming. Let's put *all* possible names there. Stupid or smart, tweaky or radical, everything goes into the list. After the brainstorming we can see where we stand. Maybe there will be a community favorite

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> that is undeniably better than everything we have seen so far? Maybe not, but I don't know, and I guess nobody does. Sorry to underestimate the effort put into the blog posts, but right now I feel like we only have I-have-this-idea-and-here-is-my-tunnel-visioned-justification-for-it kind of proposals.

[21:39] <AlexDaniel> And personally, I don't even think that we have to decide if the name should be changed/tweaked at all at first. If we did change or tweak the name, what would the best one be? Let's see, and then we can think if we can actually do it…

[21:40] <lizmat> FWIW, I think we can get close to the desired PR effect by just consistently using "Rakudo Perl 6" vs "Perl 6" the same way one would use "perl" and "Perl"

[21:41] <lizmat> aka the former being the implementation, the latter being the name of the language

[21:41] <lizmat> and in case of "Rakudo Perl 6", one could argue it is *an* implementation

[21:42] <lizmat> now, if p5p would start using "Pumpking Perl 5" instead of "perl", we could reach a. some symmetry and b. some distance

[21:42] * AlexDaniel can't really see how “Rakudo Perl 6” is more marketable than “Perl 6”, but I really have no idea…

[21:43] <samcv> ok WOW

[21:43] <samcv> in my tests concatting various languages. with actual normal lengths of text

[21:43] <samcv> from 9.829 seconds to  2.761

[21:43] <samcv> and i haven't yet seprately timed the concatting from the other code here

[21:44] <lizmat> cool, that would help say() a lot  :-)

[21:44] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: try googling for "Rakudo Perl 6" and "Perl 6" and compare the results

[21:45] <lizmat> the first hit for "Perl 6" for me is https://www.activestate.com/activeperl

[21:45] <samcv> so this is concatting text 4650 chars long

[21:45] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: which doesn't even have the string "Perl 6" in it

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: perl6.org, perl6.org/downloads/, wikipedia, “Why in The World Would Anyone Use Perl 6? | Zoffix Znet”

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> damn personalized results…

[21:47] <lizmat> aka, welcome to my bubble  :-)

[21:48] <lizmat> "Perl 6" has 8.5M results for me, "Rakudo Perl 6" has 40K results for me

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> “rakudo perl 6” stuff seems to be more technical and less bloggy

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> *shrug* but we can also start renaming it to pisix or whateverlang and in a month we'll have decent google results pointing to the official resources… I guess it'll take a bit more to convince me about the marketing benefits :S

[21:54] <samcv> m: say 10.8090910379193/4.48341698

[21:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37250e: OUTPUT: «2.41090469303600␤»

[21:54] <Zoffix> FWIW, my view on the naming approach is no one has issues with letting technical decisions be made based on the people's expertise, but when name/branding is at question, then suddenly everyone's a Marketing Director and a Brand Manager (proper jobs you have to go to college for).

[21:54] <samcv> so 2.4x faster with 4000 character unicode text

[21:54] <samcv> 16% faster with 460 characters

[21:55] <samcv> only case it is slower is if you are renfging single codepoints. but that can be optimized if we want i suppose special case low numbers of codeponits

[21:55] <Zoffix> So the "let's start a wiki" approach sounds to me like a sound way to burn everyone out on an issue everyone's already burnt out.

[21:55] <lizmat> samcv: what about concatting something with about 80 chars and a newline ?

[21:56] <Zoffix> So IMO instead of a wiki, TimToady should make the call, asking for community suggestions if he's short on ideas.

[21:56] <samcv> lizmat, that may not get a speedup

[21:56] <samcv> though i can see if i can special case that

[21:56] <lizmat> Zoffix: agree, that would be the RFC , Apocalypse, etc... all over again

[21:56] <samcv> more than it is maybe

[21:56] <samcv> hm

[21:56] * Zoffix &'s again

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> no… that would be brainstorming… a list of possible names…

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> but if we don't want that, sure…

[21:57] <samcv> lizmat, so i guess it calls concat as part of the operation

[21:57] <lizmat> yup

[21:58] <lizmat> io_operators, line 24 would be the hottest path

[21:58] <samcv> line 24 of which file

[21:58] <lizmat> src/core/io_operators.pm

[21:58] <lizmat> alternately, if someone would implement nqp::say  :-)

[21:59] <samcv> do we already have that?

[21:59] <lizmat> hmmm... that would not work atm, as the interface sorta defines we call IO::Handle.print, not IO::Handle.say

[21:59] <lizmat> samcv: no we don't

[22:00] <samcv> m: use nqp; nqp::say('test')

[22:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37250e: OUTPUT: «test␤»

[22:00] <lizmat> hmmm... duh

[22:00] <samcv> or not to a specific filehandle you mean?

[22:00] <lizmat> ah, yes  :-)

[22:00] <samcv> ah ok

[22:00] <samcv> this would make things a lot faster i think... printing out output. i should do this

[22:01] <lizmat> anyways, I think the comment in io_operators is bogus

[22:01] <lizmat> at least at that place

[22:01] <samcv> yeah idk it is weird
