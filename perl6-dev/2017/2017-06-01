[00:00] <buggable> And the winning number is 7! Congratulations to alphah! You win a can of WD40!

[00:00] <Zoffix> hahaha

[00:00] <Zoffix> buggable++

[00:05] <Zoffix> Wonder if WD40 is even a thing outside of North America :)

[00:06] <ugexe> WD40 doesnt work on metric

[00:16] * geekosaur *eyeroll*

[00:17] <Zoffix> ZofBot: You've rolled a six!

[00:17] <ZofBot> Zoffix, ) You also can't make assignment metaoperators from diffy operators

[00:32] <Zoffix> Since I object to smoking, I'm to name my ecosystem smoker "toaster" and will coin the term "toasting the ecosystem" :)

[00:34] * ugexe vapes the ecosystem

[00:58] <BenGoldberg> If you forget to clean out the crumbs, your toaster may smoke.

[01:00] <geekosaur> surely it should be 'roaster'

[01:02] <Zoffix> I have a speech impediment. "roaster" is hard to say :P

[01:04] <BenGoldberg> How does roasting differ from baking?

[01:05] * BenGoldberg suddenly thinks of simulated annealing, which is yet another erm, "hot" idea.

[01:32] <Zoffix> hm, somehow I thought Proc has .pid :S

[01:32] <Zoffix> guess it's not really designed for async use with promises

[01:55] <Zoffix> Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 7

[01:55] <Zoffix> no such file or directory

[01:55] <Zoffix> greeaaaat

[01:56] <Zoffix> No line number or anything

[01:57] <Zoffix> Also notice run takes *@args ($, *@) but Proc.new takes $path, *@args, so if you change your run <zef --serial --debug install> to Proc::Async.new: <zef --serial --debug install> like I just did, it'll stop working -_-

[01:58] <Zoffix> ZofBot: complain all the things

[01:58] <ZofBot> Zoffix, Getting information back from the external process's "STDOUT" or "STDERR", is done by a "Supply" that either gets characters or bytes

[01:59] <Zoffix> This is Karma. After years of Perl folks making fun of PHP didn't go unpunished.

[02:00] <Zoffix> https://tnx.nl/php.html#names

[02:08] <Zoffix> "not enough memory" hm. I was starting 2 promises + 1 proc async for all the modules in the ecossystem on 24GB box

[02:08] <Zoffix> buggable: eco

[02:08] <buggable> Zoffix, Out of 834 Ecosystem dists, 0 have warnings, 1 have errors, and 0 have no tags in META file. See https://modules.perl6.org/update.log for details

[02:08] <Zoffix> m: say 834*3

[02:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8ec181: OUTPUT: «2502␤»

[02:08] * Zoffix tries throwing moar RAM at it

[02:10] <Zoffix> 455GB... It better run now

[02:11] <MasterDuke> how much does that cost per hour?

[02:12] <ugexe> if you are installing to the same location for each module you might still be spending a bunch of time stuck waiting for locks

[02:14] <Zoffix> boooo "Starting VM instance "toaster" failed. Error: The zone 'projects/perl6-build/zones/us-central1-b' does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request. Try a different zone, or try again later."

[02:14] <ugexe> its possible it could be faster if you installed each one to a unique --install-to, and then programatically update PERL6LIB

[02:14] <Zoffix> MasterDuke: $1.109

[02:14] <Zoffix> Well, speed isn't my issue ATM. Running it at all is :/

[02:14] <Zoffix> MasterDuke: with 24CPUs

[02:15] <MasterDuke> that could start to add up if they ever let you run it

[02:16] <Zoffix> Yeah. I don't plan on keeping that :D Just wanted to see how much RAM this program would take

[02:17] <Zoffix> (famous last words before "we forgot to turn off our VM for a month" stories)

[02:20] <Zoffix> Got it to boot with a 156GB RAM VM. Program is 70GB and climbing.

[02:20] <Zoffix> m: say 834*3*142

[02:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8ec181: OUTPUT: «355284␤»

[02:20] <Zoffix> Guess it needs 355GB. There's like a billion of moar processes each using ~142MB

[02:20] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/55fb01b1c1d38ddde6319647faa9ac6cff263878/README.pod (grep $ zef -v --jobs=2 install CSV::Parser) zef used to do concurrency too, in 2015

[02:21] <ugexe> ===> Module count: 364

[02:21] <Zoffix> :)

[02:22] <Zoffix> Well, it created all the procs and all the promises and started testing stuff, but RAM usage is still climbing 120GB now

[02:23] <Zoffix> aha, leved out at 124GB \o/

[02:24] <Zoffix> ah, damn... that's cause the 5-minute job timeout I set kicked in and killed all the things :(

[02:32] <Zoffix> m: so try await start 42

[02:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8ec181: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "so " in expression "so try await start 42" in sink context (line 1)␤»

[02:32] <Zoffix> that's not useless yo

[02:35] <Zoffix> 32CPU/210GB box. Much springier. With several-hour proc timeout. Hoping it'll complete :)O

[02:36] <Zoffix> geekosaur: toaster also starts with "t", just like "testing" BTW :)

[02:38] <Zoffix> yeah, seems to platau at ~124GB and 1240 "threads" (whatever htop calls threads)

[02:45] <Zoffix> 144GB/1071 threads

[02:45] <Zoffix> didn't really move in the output of tested modules. Still finished with only 9

[02:49] <Zoffix> grr, I think it's actually my buggy terminal that "froze"

[02:49] <Zoffix> oh it's asking for github pass... really :\

[02:50] <Zoffix> Well, this was a good 20 minutes of fun.

[02:50] * Zoffix deems the experiment a failure and goes to bed

[02:52] <Zoffix> Wonder how to go around the gitub pass thing. Is it asking for it just to pull from git://?  I don't wanna give (or cache) any passwords on this box, which running 820+ pieces of software from complete strangers.

[12:47] <jnthn> No, that won't flatten automatically (relatively little does)

[12:58] <|Tux|> I played with flat too, but could not find something that "worked"

[13:00] <|Tux|> so it needs both .List *and* flat

[13:00] <Zoffix> |Tux|: that's cause the items come from an Array and are containerized, so flat won't flatten them. The two examples I mentioned should work

[13:00] <|Tux|> perl6 -e 'sub MAIN (List :$dirs=[]) { .say for flat @$dirs.List».split: /","/}' --dirs=d1 --dirs=d2 --dirs=d3,d4,d5

[13:01] <Zoffix> Or map a slip: .say for $dirs.map: |*.split: /","/

[13:07] <Zoffix> Is there a point in (*@args ($, *@)) sig, rather than just (*@args) ?

[13:07] <Zoffix> like, literally that; unpacked to anons

[13:09] <Zoffix> Ah, yes: spec you want at least one item

[14:05] <pmurias> Zoffix: what's the bottle neck with zef?

[14:06] <Zoffix> pmurias: no idea

[14:07] <Zoffix> It's just a million times slower. I couldn't even spot which modules were being installed by cpanm, it was installing them so fast

[14:11] <timotimo> i wonder what a "perf record -g" would give us

[14:13] <timotimo> like, is there an obvious hot spot for the whole process?

[14:13] <timotimo> probably just a complete across-the-board slowness of rakudo + moarvm :\

[14:19] <ugexe> well for installation you have to wait for precompile

[14:19] <timotimo> p5 doesn't do that at all, right?

[14:19] <ugexe> most everything else spawns a process to do work (wget, curl, whatever)

[14:19] <ugexe> and probably the json/hash searching method

[14:19] <timotimo> do you get faster zef execution when something like our UserAgent module is installed?

[14:20] <ugexe> right p5 doesn't precompile things

[14:20] <ugexe> I'm not sure. Net::HTTP used to be built into zef and I don't recall it being significantly faster

[14:21] <timotimo> dang.

[14:29] <ugexe> i think the fastest win would be not using json for the ecosystem listing

[14:30] <ugexe> like something with some alphabetical ordering or something that could be stream parsed and short-circuit early

[14:30] <timotimo> interesting, i was wondering if i should give JSON::Fast something "path filter" like

[14:30] <ugexe> still, it has to search `provides` sections as well

[14:31] <timotimo> the ecosystem api could transform the complete list to split it apart

[14:31] <ugexe> well i dont use a json module in zef, and this is because it ensures the json read/generated matches what compunit::repository sees/can handle

[14:31] <timotimo> i mean the web service

[14:32] <timotimo> oh

[14:33] <ugexe> yeah. i'm not sure what the best format would be, but thats probably what needs to be done. zef's local cache and compunit repository use \0 delimited lines to split an identity into parts for instance (but this doesn't allow nested data that would probably want to be searched)

[14:33] <ugexe> er, \0 delmited fields, each dist on its own line^

[14:36] <timotimo> so .split("\n")>>.split("\0")?

[14:36] <ugexe> yeah, something like that

[14:37] <timotimo> that's what you already have, right?

[14:37] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Repository/LocalCache.pm6#L124

[14:37] <timotimo> i wonder how much worth it'd be to have a lookup-table in front

[14:37] <timotimo> or even in back

[14:38] <timotimo> ah, that store re-writes the whole thing "from scratch" for reasons

[14:39] <timotimo> but it's not actually sorted? so it could just be appending perhaps?

[14:39] <ugexe> yeah it doesn't sort. and don't pay too much attention to the details as they are probably wrong

[14:39] <timotimo> it's probably not a hot piece of code, but it would grow with number of installed dists

[14:40] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Repository/LocalCache.pm6#L95

[14:40] <ugexe> this is likely the slowest part

[14:40] <ugexe> also Zef::Repository::* has that method

[14:40] <ugexe> ha i see a comment on short-circuiting that used to exist too

[14:41] <timotimo> how much more often do you search compared to storing?

[14:50] <ugexe> oh yeah thats dumb

[14:50] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Repository/LocalCache.pm6#L23 # *reads* what .store writes

[14:51] <ugexe> but the localcache though thats probably not bad. let me point exactly at the more likely culprit

[14:56] <ugexe> well i guess i don't know where exactly, but probably https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/lib/Zef/Repository/Ecosystems.pm6 (which has a possible benchmarkable code snippet here https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/xt/repository.t#L45)

[17:28] <nine> Zoffix: I was being quite sarcastic :)

[17:29] <Zoffix> Ah :)

[17:57] <Zoffix> Looks like there's some confusion among users using rakudobrew thinking they're using R*: http://perl6maven.com/getting-started-with-bailador#comment-3327453415

[17:57] <Zoffix> Also, `2017.04.2-2-ge1c086b`; it's one of the lemons. People don't realize they use crap commits.

[18:04] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: wait, why is evalable6 dumb?

[18:05] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: 'cause I didn't want to eval any code

[18:06] <AlexDaniel> well, um, maybe evalable knows better?

[18:07] <Zoffix> In fact, its replies interrupted my acting out a fatal programming error and if I don't get an oscar, I might just sue

[18:08] <AlexDaniel> ye right… last time I was doing regressionable stuff, I found a bunch of shitfiles scattered everywhere

[18:08] <Zoffix> XD

[18:08] <Zoffix> I tend to put all my files under /tmp

[18:08] <AlexDaniel> restricted setting does not help, especially if you're using 2 year old commits to test stuff…

[18:09] <Zoffix> m: use NativeCall; sub system(Str) is native {}; say system 'cal'

[18:09] <Zoffix> hehe

[18:11] <AlexDaniel> luckily we don't have many retarded vandals here, so I can get away with not implementing secure eval for a little bit more… even when you give them clear instructions on how to trick the restricted setting

[18:11] <Zoffix> Oh noes! You've used the prohibited word!

[18:12] <AlexDaniel> which one? “eval”?

[18:12] <AlexDaniel> use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL;

[18:13] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: the one that was arbitrarily chosen to be offending to mentally disabled, despite no one actually using that word to describe the actual mentally disabled, just like no one uses "idiot" to describe the actual mentally disabled

[18:14] <Zoffix> I got shit for using it last time, and I'll be damned if I let you get away with using it!

[18:14] <Zoffix> Apologize!

[18:15] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: why talk at all if not to offend those who always want to be offended?

[18:16] <AlexDaniel> but still, yes, I'll pick a different word next time

[18:16] <Zoffix> The argument's natural conclusion is all insults must be removed from use.

[18:17] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: out of curiosity, which word will you plan on using as a substitute?

[18:18] <AlexDaniel> Any suggestions? I was thinking, like, “faggots”, but then realized…

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> to be honest, I've never really thought about the origin of insults

[18:20] <AlexDaniel> especially those that are not in my native language…

[18:20] <AlexDaniel> like, insults are just insults, no? I guess not…

[18:20] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: no, never found a good replacement for retarded. All the related words don't quite have the same strength to them, and well, they all equate the insulted person or object to those of lower mental abilities, so if you're not going to use retarded for that reason, you can't use things like "idiot" either, and from then it all spirals down to all insults being bad.

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: “brainless”?

[18:22] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I think insults are a lot about context. There's nothing negative about being a baby, a child, or a girl; it's the context alone that give those word insult-like qualities when they're used as insults.

[18:23] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: strength isn't there :) Even before the cultural shift to avoid "retarded" it was a bit too vulgar to use in, say, an office meeting, but "brainless" is much milder.

[18:24] <Zoffix> I guess modifiers could bring up to equal strength, something like "god damn brainless" or "fucking brainless", though the latter overshoots a bit

[18:26] <AlexDaniel> .oO( braińļeşs͞ ?)

[18:27] <Zoffix> hah

[18:27] <AlexDaniel> oh wait, modifiers, not combiners!

[18:28] <AlexDaniel> ᴮᴿᴬᴵᴺᴸᴱᶳᶳ ?

[18:29] <AlexDaniel> yes, no S

[18:29] <[Coke]> If you can't find a better insult, perhaps you have an issue yourself.

[18:30] <Zoffix> Is that a bad thing? :P

[18:30] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: that's a good insult

[18:30] <Zoffix> haha

[18:30] <[Coke]> I'm not going to call you names about it, if that's what you're asking. :)

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I like the idea of replacing all possibly offending words with a random sequence of unicode characters

[18:34] <Zoffix> :D

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> then anybody can make anything he wants out of it

[18:34] <AlexDaniel> they want, I mean

[22:54] <Zoffix> (cause IIRC the proto being being placed into Mu was for something to do with shaped array candidates)

[22:55] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: your favorite type of errors: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-06-01#i_14673283

[22:56] <Zoffix> haha

[22:57] <Zoffix> I guess that error should now be extended to mention IO::CatHandle's &.on-switch

[23:04] <AlexDaniel> honestly, when I came to perl 6 with some perl 5 knowledge, these errors were extremely helpful

[23:04] <AlexDaniel> now that I think perl 6, I hate them with passion

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> I guess you can't get both

[23:06] <timotimo> :D

[23:06] <Zoffix> Sure you can. You pack them into "TeachingAid::Errors" module and remove them from core.

[23:07] <timotimo> hm. then people coming from perl5 would need to "use TeachingAid::Errors" or something in all their scripts

[23:07] <timotimo> that'll be the new "use strict"? :P

[23:08] <Zoffix> Considering these errors interfere with normal Perl 6 programs and you'll be a "Perl 6 programmer writing Perl 6" infinitely longer than "Perl 5 programmer writing Perl 6", they don't pay for themselves.

[23:08] <timotimo> that's true

[23:09] <Zoffix> Why would that need be new strict? If you feel these suggestions would help you, you'd alias `perl6` to `perl6 -MTrainingAir::Errors` and be done with it. I can't recall these errors ever being helpful to me in my switch from perl 5 to perl6. I may have mistyped .elems with .length, but "no such method" would get me straight equally well

[23:10] <timotimo> hm, if you alias it, that wouldn't be picked up by hashbangs, but you could no longer run "perl6 somescript.p6" without it sometimes breaking

[23:11] * Zoffix hates those errors enough not to care about that :D

[23:11] <timotimo> :)

[23:12] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: why not just fix all cases where they interfere

[23:12] <timotimo> they were put in as a feature

[23:13] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: from my POV? Because it's a useless feature and spending human hours fixing it is a waste.

[23:14] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: but if you were an ✓×⋅²≈ trying to shove perl 5 code into rakudo, would these errors actually be “useless”?

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> I don't think so

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> I loved these error messages so much

[23:15] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: how much worse would've been generic errors?

[23:15] <Zoffix> "no such method .length on Array"

[23:15] <Zoffix> m: -> \new { say new if $++ }(42)

[23:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar b667e8: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unsupported use of C++ constructor syntax; in Perl 6 please use method call syntax␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3-> \new { say new if 7⏏5$++ }(42)␤»

[23:16] <Zoffix> Ah, yes, I remember my days as a C++ like it were NEVER

[23:16] <Zoffix> as a C++ programmer

[23:16] * Zoffix leaves to hack on toaster

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> well, I've never thought about it this way :)

[23:17] <AlexDaniel> what I know for sure is that generic messages don't have any love in them

[23:18] * AlexDaniel shrugs

[23:18] <AlexDaniel> maybe you are right
