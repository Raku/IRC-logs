[00:14] <samcv> ok actually not. i fixed a bunch of issues tho trying to solve that one hah

[00:15] <Skarsnik> lol

[00:15] <samcv> but i did get some info on that. it is /leaking some memory from the utf8 encoder. tho idk if that's because it bailed or not. though i'd want it to clean up.

[00:18] <samcv> ok i found a missing free :)

[00:19] <samcv> not causing the decode error though. it's just not freeing the buffer on that particular cause of utf8 failure

[00:19] <samcv> yay! fix everything except this problem!

[06:08] <lizmat> Files=1223, Tests=67674, 269 wallclock secs (13.28 usr  4.97 sys + 1812.53 cusr 189.13 csys = 2019.91 CPU)

[06:11] <timotimo> morning lizmat

[06:11] <timotimo> i'm just about ready to head to breakfast

[06:13] <timotimo> see you in a bit

[06:23] <samcv> morning

[06:27] <timotimo> moinmoin

[06:56] <samcv> at least *now* that utf8 is failing always at the same spot

[07:01] <samcv> i'm going to split up the file until i have a smaller section of it to find the invalid part

[07:08] <samcv> uh i can't reproduce if i head -n the first half or i tail -n the second half

[07:08] <samcv> or even head the first 2/3 or tail the last 2/3

[07:08] <samcv> weird...

[07:12] <timotimo> have you considered using rr to have reverse debugging?

[07:12] <samcv> am able to get it failing by doing head -n -100 so i will continue doing that until it stops erroring

[07:12] <samcv> no

[07:20] <timotimo> i demonstrated two pieces of perl6 + sdl2 at the SPW in a lightning talk; i probably ought to clean them up, put them in the official repo, and make people aware they can actually get the examples

[07:30] <samcv> i split it into 1000 pieces and now i scripted it to try each one and delete it if there was no decoding error

[07:31] <samcv> nice

[07:34] <samcv> some of the split sections are causing moar to just kind of hang

[07:35] <samcv> well seemigly it's doing nothing, they should all be exactly the same size

[07:36] <samcv> i just naïvely split them so some of them are gonna be invalid. but moar shouldn't freeze

[07:40] <timotimo> hm, attach gdb, grab a backtrace?

[07:40] <samcv> yeah

[07:44] <samcv> not getting much, gonna try using perf so i can see what's using the cpu. when i stopped and got a backtrace it was just like not anything seemingly interesting

[07:45] <samcv> not even seeing anything decoding related

[07:45] <samcv> weird...

[07:46] <timotimo> anything interesting at all in strace?

[07:46] <timotimo> unlikely, but you (at least i) never know

[07:46] <samcv> if i slurp the string i get utf-8 invalid. but this is using the same method of the other bug

[07:47] <samcv> so there's some defect in how we handle certain utf8 decoding

[07:48] <samcv> uh just read, fstat, lseek, brk on repeat

[07:48] <samcv> those and just repeated forever

[07:48] <samcv> in that order

[07:48] <samcv> like looping

[07:49] <samcv> i mean the files are only 15K each

[07:49] <samcv> so it should'nt have THAT much to read

[07:51] <timotimo> do the numbers for lseek change?

[07:51] <timotimo> the one in the middle in particular

[07:53] <samcv> yes they repeat

[07:53] <samcv> wc -l #> 456789 and after sort | uniq #> 3153

[07:54] <timotimo> interesting. and how many bytes does read grab from the file?

[07:55] <samcv> curl 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/samcv/af004626d8aa46c36e828d4a950d24e3/raw/bc4cd9d630075484c8b54428d6eac0b2d20c112a/xagr_base64' | base64 -d > xagr

[07:55] <samcv> if you want the file

[07:56] <samcv> timotimo, here's the last 100 lines of the strace https://gist.github.com/d45aa46c0b17e8bd70677985a1555a46

[07:56] <timotimo> that's a weird file

[07:56] <samcv> which one. the strace or `xagr`

[07:56] <timotimo> xagr

[07:56] <samcv> yeah. it's 1/1000 of that file that was causing the original utf8 bug

[07:57] <timotimo> huh, it keeps reading 0 bytes

[07:57] <samcv> awesome

[07:57] <timotimo> and the seek adjusts the position by 0 bytes

[07:57] <samcv> how can you read that? for my reference

[07:57] <samcv> yeah i noticed that

[07:57] <samcv> read(13 is that reading 13 bytes?

[07:57] <timotimo> nope, file handle number 13

[07:57] <timotimo> strace helpfully shows the result of the read as a string in the middle

[07:58] <timotimo> and the number of bytes read is returned by read

[07:58] <samcv> ahhh

[07:58] <timotimo> the big number is the limit i'd expect

[07:58] <samcv> is there a utility to deduplicate across many lines

[07:58] <timotimo> like sort | uniq but without the sort?

[07:58] <samcv> i guess maybe i can regex and replace the repeating section with one of itself

[08:00] <timotimo> i'm afraid i don't know how to get uniq without sort without any extra tools

[08:00] <timotimo> surely awk has something, otherwise perl

[08:01] <samcv> it's doing a ton of reading nothing

[08:01] <samcv> even near the top

[08:01] <samcv> h/o

[08:02] <timotimo> h/o?

[08:02] <samcv> https://gist.github.com/7bbfbabb8ae4f87424235ba388eecec4 first 1000 lines

[08:02] <samcv> (hold/on)

[08:02] <timotimo> ah

[08:02] <samcv> by line 850 or so it's reading from FD 13 0 bytes

[08:03] <samcv> around 800

[08:05] <timotimo> i don't get it. it should totally know that it's at the EOF

[08:05] <samcv> well. it's invalid utf8

[08:05] <timotimo> does the decoder "want one more byte please" but the file handle keeps givin back 0 bytes?

[08:05] <timotimo> so they pingpong endlessly?

[08:05] <samcv> xagr: line 243, char 126, byte 14678: After a first byte between E1 and EC, expecting two following bytes.

[08:06] <samcv> that could be what's happening

[08:06] <samcv> give me more bytes!

[08:07] <timotimo> here you go, 0 bytes

[08:07] <samcv> give me more bytes!

[08:07] <samcv> :R

[08:07] <timotimo> let's see here, yeah we have 0 bytes for you

[08:14] <samcv> let me try doing a --profile

[08:16] <samcv> timotimo, is there a signal i can send to moarvm that will cause it to exit cleanly and output a profile? ctl + c ain't doing it

[08:16] <timotimo> no, you'd have to tap a signal and that gives you an extra thread that can make the profiler unhappy

[08:17] <timotimo> i think i'll head down to the lobby, liz and wendy probably arrive soon

[08:17] <timotimo> for some hackathon time \o/

[08:20] <samcv> fun!

[08:21] <samcv> tell them i say hi!

[11:51] <piojo> I tricked the perl6 into giving me bad error output when using grammars--it should have told me I had a missing method, but instead told me:

[11:51] <piojo> P6opaque: no such attribute '$!pos' in type Matcher when trying to get a value

[11:51] <piojo> I assume this issue should be filed with Rakudo?

[11:52] <piojo> (not moarvm)

[11:56] <piojo> No worries, I reported it for rakudo

[12:10] <nine> TimToady: isn't the caller's caller the caller's problem? In pseudo code: {use v6.c; Foo { method parse-some() { return $some-grammar.parse(...) } } }; { use v6.d; Foo.parse-some(); } The 6.c code calls parse, so it gets a Nil on parse failure. It adopted parse's API by just returning the Nil. Now a 6.d caller comes along and will get the Nil. But I think that's quite OK.

[12:11] <nine> TimToady: The 6.c method has always returned Nil on parse failure and will continue to do so. That it's implemented by using a grammar and juts passing on parse's return value is an implementation detail that it's caller must not care about. So it's wrong for the caller to expect anything but a Nil.

[12:12] <nine> TimToady: the way for the caller to get something else would be to have a new version of Foo that's written in 6.d. Or to change it's implementation in another way.

[12:20] <timotimo> oh it's nine \o/

[12:20] <timotimo> piojo probably got a method that's already taken by Match or Grammar, that probably caused that problem?

[12:21] <nine> TimToady: that'd be my guess

[12:21] <nine> err.... timotimo ^^^

[12:21] <nine> Apparently irssi doesn't consider case when completing nicks and I've never noticed that before

[12:22] <timotimo> mhm

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> .tell pyrimidine https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-08-27#i_15075855

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> .tell pyrimidine mystery resolved. It's still not as low, but that's possibly noise

[12:53] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to pyrimidine.

[13:53] <dogbert11> hmm, this Malformed UTF8 bug sure is strange

[13:56] <dogbert11> I put a breakpoint at the place where the error msg is printed out and took a look at what different vars were set to

[13:56] <dogbert11> so we have: Breakpoint 1, MVM_string_utf8_decodestream (tc=0x804c588, ds=0x9e943b0, stopper_chars=0x0, seps=0x9e94498) at src/strings/utf8.c:496

[13:57] <dogbert11> looking at the decodestream (ds) one thing stands out:

[13:57] <dogbert11> and that is 'abs_byte_pos'

[13:57] <dogbert11> $1 = {bytes_head = 0x85479d8, bytes_tail = 0x85479d8, chars_head = 0x9f1fdf8, chars_tail = 0x9f1fdf8, chars_reuse = 0x0, abs_byte_pos = 14680064, bytes_head_pos = 0, chars_head_pos = 0, encoding = 1,

[13:57] <dogbert11> result_size_guess = 144, norm = {form = MVM_NORMALIZE_NFG, buffer = 0x8286f98, buffer_size = 64, buffer_start = 10, buffer_end = 11, buffer_norm_end = 10, first_significant = 768, quick_check_property = 29,

[13:57] <dogbert11> translate_newlines = 1, prepend_buffer = 0, regional_indicator = 0}, decoder_state = 0x0}

[13:58] <dogbert11> m: say 14680064 % 1048576 # the IO subsystem tries to read one Meg byte blocks according to strace

[13:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar f097e5: OUTPUT: «0?»

[14:00] <dogbert11> it seems to me that the problem appears right at a buffer boundary

[14:01] * dogbert11 enough rambling

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> dammit. What's the difference between “lines” and “slurp.lines”?

[14:02] * AlexDaniel (?°?°??? ???

[14:04] <dogbert11> I added a few characters to the file a bit above the failing line, 257... something and the problem went away

[14:05] <dogbert11> so the byte(s) which causes the problem is no longer at a buffer boundary

[14:05] * dogbert11 points out that this is amateur nonsense :)

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: yeah, that sound about right

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> s

[14:06] <dogbert11> where are all the cool core devs, recovering from SPW perhaps :)

[14:17] <BenGoldberg> lines should lazily read $*IN a line at a time.

[14:17] <AlexDaniel> what's “a line”?

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> any comments on https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1472 welcome

[14:18] <BenGoldberg> slurp.lines will first read all of $*IN, and then, after that, split it into individual Strs.

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> .tell moritz sometimes .split(“\n”) is actually the right way to do it https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1472

[14:19] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to moritz.

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> bwahahahahah

[14:25] <Zoffix> BenGoldberg: lines() alone will read them lazily (not line by line, as there's a buffer involved, but not the whole file at once)

[14:25] <Zoffix> BenGoldberg: it returns a Seq, which is not a Positional mandated by the @ sigil. You need to bind it to $ var

[14:26] <BenGoldberg> Zoffix, Got it, thanks :)

[14:28] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I can answer what's "a line" for IO::Handle.lines: lines are delimited with the $.in-in separator

[14:29] <Zoffix> And looking at the sauce for Str.lines, there a line is separated by nqp::const::CCLASS_NEWLINE chars...

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> right, so the fact that Proc::Async does something else is actually a bug I think

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> sorry I'm jumping from one topic to another…

[14:30] <Zoffix> :)

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> anyway: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1472#issuecomment-325201876

[14:35] <AlexDaniel> .tell jnthn FWIW, remember I asked how to process null-separate output? Turns out there's an identical problem when trying to process \n-separated output. See https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1472 and https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131923

[14:35] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[14:53] <samcv> AlexDaniel, slurp.lines slurps everything and then turns it into lines. .lines reads it on demand (with a buffer of course)

[14:58] <yoleaux> Zoffix: check on Win10: https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131375

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> samcv: it's not just that, which is the whole deal with https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1472

[15:03] <samcv> wait what why does it do that

[15:04] <samcv> it splits on \r by itself?

[16:36] <samcv> AlexDaniel, peolple use just a \r as a newline?

[16:38] <lizmat> on the old MacOS (pre X) they did

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> “Many older Mac applications use "Mac-style” line endings. This means that each line in a text file ends with a carriage return character (character 13/0xD, often abbreviated CR).”

[17:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95a70c: OUTPUT: «any(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)?»

[17:08] <lizmat> is there a reason not to do that ?

[17:09] <Skarsnik> std: dd (1|2|3) + (4|5|6)

[17:10] <lizmat> I guess we lost std: a while ago already

[17:11] <Zoffix> m: dd (1|2|3) + (4^5^6)

[17:11] <lizmat> .ask TimToady is there a reason why (1|2|3) + (4|5|6) should give any(any(5, 6, 7), any(6, 7, 8), any(7, 8, 9)) instead of any(5, 6, 7, 8, 9) ?

[17:11] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to TimToady.

[17:11] <Zoffix> Kinda makes sense for `any` to follow the same thing as other junctions

[17:12] <lizmat> Zoffix: I'm specifically asking for the case where the Junctions are of the same type

[17:12] <Zoffix> Ah
