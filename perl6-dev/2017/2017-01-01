[01:06] * [Coke] waves to lizmat from the past.

[03:33] <dugword> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/981

[03:33] <dugword> Pull request to resolve issue

[03:33] <dugword> Hey all, I just submitted a pull request to rakudo to resolve some issues with IO::Socket::INET. Please let me know if there is anything I can change in the code, or in the process I followed to document/submit my changes. (This'll be my first pull request on the project).

[03:34] <notviki> dugword: what I'm seeing is we had port default to 80 but now it's removed?

[03:37] <notviki> dugword: it's more performant to write { unless $port ~~ PIO::MIN_PORT .. PIO::MAX_PORT; } as unless PIO::MIN_PORT <= $port <= PIO::MAX_PORT;

[03:37] <notviki> guess doesn't really matter for this method.

[03:38] <dugword> I don't think that actually was the default. When I ran the code with no port specified I couldn't get a client to connect to 80

[03:38] <dugword> And the docs don't specify a default

[03:38] <dugword> Nor does roast

[03:38] <dugword> I can make that change if it is more performant. I think both are as easy to read

[03:39] <dugword> Lemme double check that port 80 thing though

[03:40] <notviki> Also, it's probably a bad idea to have two multies repeating all the defaults like that.

[03:41] <notviki> And multi method new (*%args) { can just omit the argument since we're not using it, as methods ignore any extra named params anyway

[03:44] <dugword> Idea for a better strategy on dealing with the defaults? Switch it back to a single method with an if statement for the client/server constructors? Or check to see if the values are defined before passing them to bless

[03:47] <dugword> Also, confirmed that IO::Socket::INET.new(:listen, :localhost<localhost>) does not listen on port 80. IO::Socket::INET.new(:listen, :localhost<localhost>, :localport(80)) does

[03:47] <dugword> That default is a lie :)

[03:49] <notviki> But that's $localport, not $port

[03:51] <notviki> looks like there's a bug with it

[03:51] <notviki> If you use .new() to connect, the default would apply, but I also see .connect() method that would mess up the default

[03:51] <dugword> d'oh, you are correct. port 80 does work as a default when connecting

[03:54] <dugword> I don't follow, the .connect() method seems to work with the new code

[03:55] <dugword> Both new and old code fail when a port isn't passed. .connect() requires two arguments

[03:55] <notviki> No, I was talking about the old code. The 80 default for port only worked if you used .new() and not .connect()

[03:55] <notviki> So it's probably fine that it's omited

[03:57] <notviki> dugword: as for de-duplicating the defaults. I think if we stick them onto the attributes and add *%rest slurpies to .new()s and then just slip those into .bless(|%rest, ...) then it'll work. That'll also ensure all the attributes of subclasses get passed along as well.

[03:57] <dugword> That's a good idea

[03:58] <dugword> Should I update the .connect() method? It could default to the current value of $.port

[03:59] <notviki> No, it's fine. And leave off the 80 default altogether. Seems a strange default and probably not worth having it.

[04:00] <notviki> I'd also relax the port/localport requiring an Int to an Int(Cool) coercer instead

[04:01] <notviki> and $family too

[04:02] <dugword> Will do, thanks

[04:06] <notviki> dugword: BTW did you run the spectest on it?    TEST_JOBS=7 make spectest

[04:06] <notviki> or TEST_JOBS=7 make stresstest  (more thorough)

[04:07] <dugword> I did, I get weird issues with one of the tests that looks at file events. But I was getting those before. make t/spec/S32-io/IO-Socket-INET.t passes

[04:08] <dugword> There are no IO::Socket::INET tests for the default port, or for parsing URIs like host:port

[04:08] <notviki> OK

[04:10] * notviki hopes to commit one more fix in the next 50 minutes...

[04:11] <notviki> "Cannot iterate object with P6opaque representation (NQPMatch)"

[04:11] <notviki> Dammit, how do I see what's in the NQPMatch :/

[04:30] * notviki gives up on trying to fix it.

[04:30] <notviki> "# This is a cheaty and evil hack."

[04:30] <notviki> Yeah, well, then why did you put it in?

[08:01] <TimToady> hny from PST!

[08:02] <Zoffix> HNY!

[08:20] * japhb wonders when the neighborhood fireworks will stop ...

[08:21] <samcv> bartolin, have you ever used Collate on JVM?

[08:21] <samcv> and what are your thoughts on JVM's compareTo for strings, which is like super vague about how it sorts, not even telling you any rules of sorting

[08:24] <samcv> Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this String object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string

[08:24] <samcv> j: say 'a' cmp 'B'

[08:37] <bartolin> samcv: sorry, I know next to nothing about that topic

[08:39] <samcv> there is Collation too though apparently

[08:40] <samcv> bartolin, are java strings stored as NFG codepoints or just as the actual provided ones? and doesn't do normalization? you know?

[08:40] <samcv> i know these are hard questions, just curious

[08:43] <samcv> weird.

[08:43] <samcv> ( that character changes on normalization )

[08:43] <samcv> oh wait

[08:43] <samcv> duh i'm dumb

[08:43] <samcv> j: say "\x[1E69]".ords

[08:43] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 8ca367: OUTPUT«(7785)␤»

[08:43] <samcv> m: 7785.base(16).say

[08:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar c5e54e: OUTPUT«1E69␤»

[08:44] <samcv> oh that was a bad example. the canonical form is the same

[08:44] <samcv> m: say "\x[1E0B]\x[0323]".ords

[08:45] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 8ca367: OUTPUT«(1E0B 323)␤True␤»

[08:45] <samcv> ah here we go :)

[08:45] <samcv> java doesn't do any normalization

[08:46] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 8ca367: OUTPUT«2␤»

[08:49] <samcv> looks like BreakIterator could return the proper number of characters

[08:50] <samcv> also java.text.Normalizer may be of interest for getting the same functionality as moar

[08:51] <samcv> looks like java has ways to do NFC and NFD and NFKC and NFKD https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/Normalizer.Form.html

[08:51] <samcv> so looks like that could eventually be implemented

[08:54] <samcv> bartolin, so you say the JVM doesn't build atm?

[08:56] <bartolin> samcv: yeah, looks like 9eef565c29 broke it. (make still works, but make install does not)

[08:56] <bartolin> "This type cannot unbox to a native number" ...

[08:56] <samcv> lameo. i don't really know java but i am willing to help out with the unicode stuff, maybe implement those

[08:57] <samcv> those errors piss me off when programming in nqp

[08:57] <samcv> bartolin, i'd also like to help add uniprop to JVM as well

[08:57] <bartolin> that sounds great! ++samcv :-)

[08:57] <samcv> i hope you know how to add ops to nqp or whatever? for jvm. can't be too hard?

[08:58] <samcv> java looks kind of boring of a language. is this true?

[09:00] <bartolin> well, tbh I'm not really proficient with java. I'm only trying to do some housekeeping and keep rakudo-j "alive" -- hoping for someone else to take over

[09:01] <bartolin> as psch noted a few times ago, we need a kind of champion for the JVM backend

[09:01] <bartolin> s/ago/earlier/

[09:02] <samcv> champion heh

[09:03] <samcv> compiling and installing would be a good bar to get to at least

[09:05] * bartolin aims at 'spectest mostly error free, so that regressions can be found (and fixed)'

[09:06] <samcv> yeah

[09:09] <gfldex> m: say (1/1000) < 0

[09:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1e3a32: OUTPUT«False␤»

[09:09] <gfldex> who broke my math?

[09:09] <gfldex> m: say (1/1000).WHAT

[09:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1e3a32: OUTPUT«(Rat)␤»

[09:10] <samcv> well 1/1000 isn't less than 0

[09:10] <samcv> at least on odd numbered days

[09:10] <Zoffix> bisectable6, say (1/1000) < 0

[09:10] <bisectable6> Zoffix, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=1e3a325) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[09:10] <bisectable6> Zoffix, Output on both points: False

[09:10] <gfldex> m: say (1/1000) > 0

[09:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1e3a32: OUTPUT«True␤»

[09:10] <bartolin> anyway, it would be really nice to get better unicode support for rakudo-j. I'd like to help with that, but I'm afraid I don't have enough tuits for the required learning and hacking :-(

[09:12] <Zoffix> gfldex, what made you think math was broken?

[09:12] <gfldex> lack of sleep

[09:12] <Zoffix> OK

[09:12] * Zoffix done some work on 0-denominator Rats recently.

[09:13] <Zoffix> Well, I did last year

[09:13] <Zoffix> :P

[09:13] <gfldex> well, I do have some problems in a script

[09:13] <samcv> Zoffix, no, he thought it was an even numbered day

[09:14] <samcv> well 0/0 is NaN tho

[09:15] <samcv> so right, left side is greater

[09:15] <samcv> i just wanted to divide by zero :(

[09:16] <samcv> i do like the 'Attempt' part though. makes it clear you actually did _not_ divide by zero hehe

[09:16] <Zoffix> m: my $a = 1/1000; my $b = 0/0; dd [ $a < $b, $a > $b, $a == $b ]

[09:19] <samcv> i think in some occurances though Java seems to compare ""lexigraphically" and other times by codepoint badly

[09:20] <samcv> maybe. i think i remember that. looking at the docs they say something about unicode codepoints, but maybe it was just the differences between sorting by NFC on moar vs like whatever Java had stored

[09:21] <samcv> the wiki page for lexographical order says it's by dictionary order, but has a specific meaning comparing length at specific points or whatever

[14:12] <nine> I just love commits like these ^^^ :)

[14:17] <bartolin> yeah, that was nice (and surprising) fix

[14:18] <bartolin> btw, now that rakudo-j builds again, could you maybe build a current camelia-on-jvm?

[14:20] <nine> bartolin: it's building right now. I'll watch it and help if needed

[14:21] <bartolin> thanks!

[14:22] <bartolin> nine++ # running camelia

[14:22] <nine> Yeah, the good old java.lang.RuntimeException: Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/jvm/stage2/QRegex.nqp'

[14:37] <nine> Aha, it's trying to load /home/camelia/rakudo-j-inst-1/share/nqp/lib/Perl6/ModuleLoader.jar instead of blib/Perl6/ModuleLoader.jar

[14:37] <nine> "it" being NQP's module loader. So those gorram build issues may be fixed by shuffling around NQP's search paths

[14:39] <bartolin> ooc did you do a git clean -dfx first?

[14:42] <nine> No, but I did delete blib/Perl6/*

[14:42] <nine> But since it finds the old, _installed_ QRegex.jar instead of the one in blib, it ought to be a search path priority issue

[14:42] <bartolin> *nod*

[14:54] <nine> nqp-j does have a --module-path argument, but AFAICS you can only give it a single path which is not enough to cover both blib and the installed nqp libs :/

[15:43] <psch> doesn't sound too bad i suppose

[21:53] <bartolin> oh, that happened on older r-j as well (8ca367 is from 2016-11-27)

[21:53] <bartolin> so, the failing tests are probably new tests

[21:54] <bartolin> there are failing tests in S03-operators/cmp.t, S32-list/produce.t, S32-num/fatrat.t and S32-num/rat.t

[21:57] <psch> ah

[21:57] <psch> still curious

[21:57] <psch> but then i haven't actually looked at the cmp impl

[21:59] <bartolin> I suspected some recent changes (like a567eb44ca) to cause the failures, since Zoffix++ did some work in that area

[22:00] <psch> infix:<cmp>(Real, Real) looks weird from here, but that probably just means i shouldn't look at code right now anymore... :)

[22:02] <psch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Rational.pm#L45

[22:02] <psch> is where we could check for ?$!denominator i suppose

[22:02] <psch> or patch div_In to call through to a HLL exception handler maybe, although i guess that'd still throw upwards far enough

[22:03] <psch> r: use nqp; nqp::div_In(0,0)

[22:03] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 8ca367: OUTPUT«java.lang.ArithmeticException: BigInteger divide by zero␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:03] <camelia> ..rakudo-moar 702f84: ( no output )

[22:03] <psch> i mean, who's right there..? :)

[22:05] <bartolin> well, that's to complicated for me (at least for this evening)

[22:11] <bartolin> ahh, there is already a ticket for (0/0).Num: RT #128264

[22:11] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128264

[22:11] <bartolin> I'll update it with the nqp stuff (maybe tomorrow)

[22:12] <bartolin> maybe I'll also fudge the failing tests with that ticket number

[22:12] <notviki> If nqp::div_In returns a native num, it should handle the _Inf/NaN cases, per IEEE

[22:13] <psch> yeah in the end it's a decision about backend congruity, which i find is hard to find a consensus for

[22:14] <notviki> And https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/498d0a4ae4 looks LTA to me, because it's producing a type that can't be used in a Rat, and I'm not entirely clear on the commit message; it says it lets us .Rat'ify Inf/NaN while keeping div-by-zero exception... well, we have that without any special types, can't we?

[22:15] <notviki> m: my Rat $x = Inf.Rat

[22:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 702f84: OUTPUT«Type check failed in assignment to $x; expected Rat but got Rational[Num,Int] (?)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:17] <psch> not sure i can grasp the intention of that patch, i think i'll go bedwards... :)

[22:18] <bartolin> there is also http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-02-24#i_2027452

[22:18] <bartolin> (taken from a comment in S32-num/rat.t)

[22:19] <bartolin> https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/8d48abf5d2398f252937e9c3f26a8c2dc1c93f82/S32-num/rat.t#L232

[22:20] <notviki> Yeah and for the the `cmp` thing TimToady also said we shouldn't throw

[22:20] <notviki> (that's what I implemented)

[22:21] <notviki> And I don't know Java, but it looks like div_In is implemented as an integer division (which can't have NaN/Inf) which is then converted into a Num, which is why it's exploding: return new BigDecimal(getBI(tc, a)).divide(new BigDecimal(getBI(tc, b)), 309, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();

[22:25] <notviki> Here's IEEE 754-2008 for reference: http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~tsimo1/CMSC455/IEEE-754-2008.pdf  Page 49, Section 7.2 says Inf/Inf or 0/0 is a NaN for "operations that produce results in floating-point format" and the next section 7.3 tells that for definite numerators you get Inf with its sign when divinding by zero
