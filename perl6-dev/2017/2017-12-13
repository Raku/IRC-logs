[12:43] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: maybe you should .tell it

[12:43] <teatime> The thing I like about you AlexDaniel is you .tell it like itis.

[12:44] <tbrowder> actually, i wanted yr opinion, too

[12:45] <tbrowder> i see the pod lang as a bit of long time effort and, as you know, i am a pragmatist.

[12:46] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: by the way not sure if you noticed this comment or not, so: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1300#issuecomment-351248903

[12:46] <tbrowder> fix now or fix MUCH later

[12:46] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: I'm OK with both as long as someone is willing to work on it :)

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> getting something to work faster is great too, we'll get more tests and more people will use it. Great.

[12:47] <tbrowder> yes, i saw comment. ok, i’ll keep using my fly swatter.

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> I would love to dive into the POD stuff deeper, but unfortunately I only have just the right amount of time to do the release and the advent post, that's it for this year :)

[12:49] <teatime> I feel like there should be some connection between pod and pandoc

[12:49] <teatime> but dunno what I would feel like / be able to, work on in that area

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> and I have nothing planned for the next year, so I'm expecting some beautiful things to come out of all that free time… :)

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> teatime: That's a nice idea actually. Sometimes I even wonder “why not just support markdown directly?”

[12:50] <teatime> yeah, or that.

[12:50] <teatime> pod feels like duplicated effort.

[12:51] <tbrowder> btw, i tried going upstream on quote issue and see a possibility, but  it is too hard to work there for me, so i will continue the fix inside Pod.nqp. my first goal is just to satisfy Damian’s chart for entering and interpreting configuration keys and their values.

[12:51] <teatime> I've also toyed with idea of making a generic documentation processor, for like literate programming in whatever language.

[12:51] <teatime> where it just takes all the comment blocks, un-comments them, concats them, and feeds to markdown processor

[12:52] <teatime> and/or the inverse, where it takes all the code blocks (perhaps tagged w/ a specific language, and/or a specific do-or-do-not-include-in-main-program tag), and concats them together and feeds them to the interpreter/compiler for the language.  again, for literate programming but language-agnostic.

[12:53] <teatime> I should actually do those... sounds worthwhile & straightforward, now that I speak it out loud.

[14:28] <tbrowder> .ask jnthn inside rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp, sub make_config, is it possible to dump to QAST, reform the QAST as desired, and inject it back as a final, serialized %config hash?

[14:28] <yoleaux> tbrowder: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[14:39] <tbrowder> after looking at the flow diagram i guess the answer is no.

[14:52] <tbrowder> .tell jnthn please disregard last question

[15:06] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> hopefully will not see them leaking again, but I don't remember any fixes in that regard

[15:06] <lizmat> mind you, I think we have an inherently unstable state of rakudo atm

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what do you mean exactly?

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> segvs in p5 tests?

[15:07] <lizmat> yup

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> by the way, any chance we'll get it nailed before the release? Or what should we do?

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> if that's a regression, maybe we should at least try bisecting it…

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> bisectable is of no help for that though

[15:10] * AlexDaniel marks it as a blocker to get more eyes on it

[15:11] <lizmat> I think it should be fixed before a release

[15:12] <lizmat> because maybe the p5 tests are just tickling a deeper lying issue

[15:12] <lizmat> that may be tickled in other ways as well

[15:14] <lizmat> afk for an hour or so&
