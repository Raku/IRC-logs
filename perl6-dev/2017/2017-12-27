[12:12] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[13:32] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel

[13:32] <AlexDaniel`> yes?

[13:34] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: the regex looks like it won’t work. is it legal to somehow use the grammar on a string in Pod.nqp?

[13:36] <AlexDaniel`> tbrowder: like through EVAL? :S I don't think we should be attempting to do any of that actually

[13:37] <tbrowder> the main prob in the p5 translation is it’s a hairy s/// construct that doesn’t lend itself to subst in nqp land. i still haven’t looked in depth at the $/ arg to make_config so i’ll go down that route next...

[13:39] <AlexDaniel`> in the end I don't think that it's going to work perfectly anyway, POD stuff really needs to be its own language

[13:39] <AlexDaniel`> so just write something small (and relatively readable) that does half of the job right, write some tests and we will move on for now

[13:41] <tbrowder> ok, i’ll keep on trucking...

[16:11] <nebuchadnezzar> Hello

[16:15] <nebuchadnezzar> I have lintian warnings and an error about names.js: https://paste.debian.net/1002576/, is it intended for that file to be like this or is it generated someway? Is it possible for it looks more like a source like src/vm/js/nqp-runtime/unicode-data.js?

[16:15] <nebuchadnezzar> I can make lintian not complaining about that file but I want to be sure first.

[16:28] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: and the counter for swear words goes down! :)

[21:22] * lizmat notes that the graph on perl6book.com is missing some books that are already published  # moritz

[21:39] <moritz> lizmat: fwiw the graph is only supposed to contain "general purpose" Perl 6 books, and not special books such as on regexes

[21:40] <moritz> so only JJ Merelo's book is missing, and i have no idea how it fits into the graph :(

[21:41] <lizmat> yeah, that's hard

[21:41] <lizmat> thing is, at one point it *was* a graph with all the Perl 6 books

[21:41] <moritz> right

[21:41] <moritz> I guess I should clarify the copy around it

[21:41] <lizmat> and now it isn't anymore, and that isn't clear from the top

[21:42] <lizmat> yup  :-)

[21:42] <lizmat> want me to make a PR ?

[21:43] <moritz> yes, please

[21:43] <lizmat> ok, will do

[21:44] <lizmat> but not while I'm in the middle of something else  :-)

[21:45] <moritz> no hurry
