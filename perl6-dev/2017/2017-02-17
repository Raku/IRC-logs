[21:03] <stmuk_> +Upload the msi package to L<http://rakudo.org/downloads/star> and L<https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/>:

[21:03] <stmuk_> can't we deprecate rakudo.org? so everything doesn't have to be uploaded twice?

[21:05] <timotimo> i wouldn't deprecate it. at least not this month

[21:05] <timotimo> i mean, we can put a link in there, sure

[21:06] <jnthn> If we get rakudo.perl6.org to be what we'd like to have at rakudo.org, we can probably arrange to have it re-pointed?

[21:06] <stmuk_> or maybe a redirect at the web server level?

[21:07] <moritz> stmuk_: my experience with data migrations is that it's best not to be hasty

[21:07] <moritz> there are lots of pointers to the old URLs still, so best keep it updated for a while

[21:08] <moritz> jnthn: yes, but then somebody has to decide what to do with the blog, and if we want to keep it, get a database dump or something

[21:08] <moritz> which I find strictly out of scope for tonight :-)

[21:08] <jnthn> For sure :)

[21:08] <stmuk_> I don't see doubling the number of uploads needed as progress and it's risky in terms of sync to depend on people doing this manually

[21:09] <jnthn> stmuk_: I don't think anybody is proposing this to the the status quo for years to come :)

[21:09] <moritz> sure, that part isn't progress, but necessary

[21:09] <jnthn> But the release is tomorrow and we ain't going to sort the rest out before then :)

[21:09] <stmuk_> true but things have a tendency to stay in place once put there

[21:10] <jnthn> Also, I thought much of our release process is automated nowadays

[21:10] <jnthn> So it's not a human doing it

[21:10] <jnthn> I may be over-estimating how much is automated

[21:10] <stmuk_> there should at the least be a deprecation message at http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/

[21:11] <moritz> IOninja: ^^ comment?

[21:11] <moritz> stmuk_: slow down. we shouldn't deprecate it while lots of our current stuff still points there

[21:11] <stmuk_> well it means I need my hack.p6c.org key coping to www.

[21:14] <IOninja> Rakudo release is automated and yes, the extra copying is not a problem. I don't believe Rakudo Star release is automated to that level.

[21:14] <stmuk_> moritz: I think adding a second set of directories was a poor decision

[21:15] <IOninja> Deprecation message? We can just redirect the download links. And if we're moving the entire site, redirect the site or something.

[21:15] <moritz> stmuk_: yes, that's clear

[21:15] <IOninja> And yes, with the release being tomorrow, let's not nix everything just now :)

[21:16] <stmuk_> IOninja: yes redirecting the download links from r.org is a good idea

[21:16] <stmuk_> and having a 7 year old star at the top of http://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/ isn't a good idea

[21:17] <IOninja> Yeah, I can do a pretty page there.

[21:17] <stmuk_> I would prefer all versions of R* before 2016.01 be hidden in an "archive" directory or similar (as I did before)

[21:17] <IOninja> Will do.

[21:18] <stmuk_> IOninja++

[21:19] <stmuk_> it probably also confuses download stats to have two sets of directories on different systems in production

[21:22] <moritz> I've changed the default sorting to show newest files first

[21:22] <stmuk_> moritz++

[21:40] <stmuk_> actually maybe long term the releases should just go on CPAN since it's an existing reliable and global system of download mirrors?

[21:42] <moritz> +Inf

[21:42] * IOninja is ༳ on that

[21:43] <IOninja> Especially considering how many times PAUSE was down and I couldn't upload jack.

[21:43] <IOninja> m: say ༳

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar ffae3f: OUTPUT«-0.5␤»

[21:43] <IOninja> :)

[21:47] <nine> WRT retiring sites or URLs, don't forget that that throws away all the search engine mojo collected for them.

[21:49] <IOninja> which is two URLs that point to a page for which there's an open ticket because its content sucks :)

[21:49] * lizmat waves from MCO

[21:49] <IOninja> But if you do redirects first, I doubt all of mojo will be lost.

[21:50] <IOninja> Google for example knows when several sites belong to one company.

[21:50] <IOninja> MCO... Motorsport Club of Ottawa? Didn't know you were visiting my province!

[21:50] <stmuk_> the trouble with not retiring sites is we still have things like

[21:51] <stmuk_> http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?rakudo

[21:51] <lizmat> IOninja: Orlando Int'l Airport  :-)

[21:51] <IOninja> :)

[21:52] <nine> stmuk_: I just love how that page has a notice about creation and update date but refuses to tell you the year :)

[21:53] <stmuk_> haha I noticed that too
