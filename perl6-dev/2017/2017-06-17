[10:01] <nine> ~~

[10:01] <yoleaux> 16 Jun 2017 19:21Z <eveo> nine: are you around by any chance? Does this MODULE_DEBUG output tell you anything why on windows even `zef --help` fails with some kind of rename issue. The code that writes to the file in question definitely closes it: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/87541b1b135620a656595f18235238e0

[10:03] <eveo> FWIW, I'm hunting a datarace when one Proc's .out feeds another Proc's .in; dunno if such setup exists in precomp somewhere

[10:03] <nine> eveo: there's more going on. Right at the top it's detecting an outdated precomp file, which means that it thinks the source file has changed since the last precompilation which actually must not happen with an installed dist.

[10:03] <nine> eveo: it doesn't

[10:05] <nine> Later on it again thinks the precomp file for the Zef module is outdated. The only reason for that message can be a source file checksum mismatch. Now even if you changed the source file before running that test, I just don't believe that you would change the source file right during the test.

[10:06] <nine> I think that's where we should look at. Not the renames. The rename issue may just be a symptom of rakudo not noticing that it already has a perfectly usable precomp file.

[10:07] <nine> I think what happens is that it thinks the precomp file is outdated, precompiles it again, loads that file (keeping it open for lazy deserialization!), then precompiles another dependency that again tries to load Zef, again thinks it's outdated, precompiles it and boom.

[10:07] <nine> It cannot rename the tmp file, because the precomp file is already open in a parent process.

[10:08] <nine> eveo: so could you please try again with my above commit? Maybe the checksums give us another hint.

[10:10] * eveo pulls and builds

[10:13] <dogbert17> nine: what could cause 'collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status' when running 'zef install Inline::Perl5'?

[10:13] <eveo> nine: here: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/a8baeeafc930c931e8f63af3f09a287a

[10:14] <dogbert17> and the important line: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl

[10:15] <nine> dogbert17: what does "perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts -e ldopts" give you?

[10:15] <dogbert17> -Wl,-E  -fstack-protector -L/usr/local/lib  -L/usr/lib/perl/5.18/CORE -lperl -ldl -lm -lpthread -lc -lcrypt

[10:15] <dogbert17> -D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DDEBIAN -fstack-protector -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -I/usr/local/include -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64  -I/usr/lib/perl/5.18/CORE

[10:16] <nine> eveo: there! It gets two totally different checksums for the same source file

[10:18] <eveo> Cool. How to fix it?

[10:23] <nine> eveo: there's probably some slight difference between $path.slurp(:enc<iso-8859-1>) and $handle.open(:enc<iso-8859-1>).slurp(:close) and $handle.open(:bin).slurp(:close).decode('iso-8859-1')

[10:23] <nine> The latter two have been in use in CompUnit::Repository::Installation. The former is in CompUnit::PrecompilationRepository.

[10:24] <nine> I'd guess the difference is with newline translation or maybe trailing newlines. Something that wouldn't matter anywhere else.

[10:26] <eveo> nine++ damn

[10:26] <eveo> Nice debugging :) Indeed there's a difference

[10:27] <eveo> C:\rakudo>perl6 -e "dd 'foo'.IO.slurp: :enc<iso-8859-1>; dd 'foo'.IO.open(:enc<iso-8859-1>).slurp"

[10:27] <eveo> "a\nb\n"

[10:27] <eveo> "a\r\nb\r\n"

[10:31] <eveo> now.. which one is the right answer? It IO::Handle.slurp seems to give "\r\n" for latin and "\n" for utf8

[10:32] <eveo> and reading the sauce, in both cases `Rakudo::Internals::VMBackedDecoder.new($!encoding, :translate-nl)` appears to be called

[10:34] <nine> Since I don't care about Windows at all, I've never given the topic on how to handle newlines any though. Which is an elaborate way of saying "I have no idea".

[10:34] <nine> Maybe we should just look at what rakudo did before jnthn's IO refactor?

[10:35] <nine> I don't think he meant to change any semantics there

[10:35] <eveo> ok

[10:35] * eveo builds 2017.04.3

[10:39] <nine> dogbert17: is there a libperl.so in /usr/lib/perl/5.18/CORE?

[10:48] <dogbert17> nine: no, can't se any. I did find a '/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.18'

[10:48] <eveo> on 2017.04.3 in both slurps latin1 gets \r\n, but utf8 gets just \n

[10:48] * eveo doesn't understand this

[10:48] <nine> dogbert17: are you just missing a perl-dev or perl-devel or whatever package?

[10:49] * dogbert17 checks

[10:50] <nine> eveo: well latin-1 is pretty much just a 1:1 relationship between bytes and characters while utf-8 is a Unicode encoding with all of the million rules Unicode brings.

[10:54] <dogbert17> nine: can't find any package with a similar name in Synaptic (running Linux Mint)

[10:55] <eveo> k, well, I'm gonna go with "slower but righter" then, for now

[11:01] <nine> dogbert17: sorry, the directory structure in http://mirrors.advancedhosters.com/linuxmint/packages/ makes zero sense to me.

[11:02] <dogbert17> nine: got it working, made a link to the lib in /usr/lib/perl/5.18/CORE and suddenly everything worked :)

[11:02] <eveo> dogbert17: fwiw, I just perlbrew my own perl: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/d41f7380da254ec3f26943dd32cff23a

[11:02] <nine> With a sensible directory structure like openSUSE's you can just go to http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/42.2/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/ and ctrl+f through the package list

[11:02] <eveo> Oh, OK, nevermind then

[11:02] <nine> dogbert17: then I guess Mint's perl package is broken and you should report that.

[11:04] <dogbert17> perhaps I should try a newer version of Mint first, the one I have is quite old

[11:15] <jnthn> morning o/

[11:15] <yoleaux> 10:15Z <eveo> jnthn: there's apparently an issue with Proc::Async.kill not killing some things (even without the Kernel.signal race issue). Allegedly started with these moarvm commits. Do any look guilty? https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-06-17#i_14745784

[11:16] <eveo> jnthn: morning

[11:16] <eveo> jnthn: do you fancy hunting a race? :)

[11:17] <jnthn> The only changes in procops.c in that commit range are adding support for bind-std*

[11:17] <jnthn> I can't think of any way the .kill code could have changed in the last month

[11:17] <jnthn> What's the race?

[11:17] <eveo> OK. Maybe it's just a fluke in reporter's test code.

[11:18] <jnthn> Well, it's also possible there was always a problem with it

[11:19] <jnthn> Guess could always strace and see what signals it actually sends

[11:21] <jnthn> Ah, I think the latin-1 problem is that it doesn't actually go through the decodestream mechanism

[11:21] <jnthn> oops

[11:21] <jnthn> Through the normalizer mechanism I meant

[11:22] <jnthn> And that's where the mapping happens

[11:22] <eveo> jnthn: some sort of race when you use one proc's out pipe as another proc's in pipe. Here's the test case; run it a few times: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/440cf8f7131632aa673b75dbb3a625b3  and I added some debug prints https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/a8c5f2eb3ca064044bbb04e947a3291b  and the output from them is https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/3351870822c4e2a54117e296121ab9a6  So the supply

[11:22] <eveo> sequencer seems to be missing one call in the failing case

[11:22] <jnthn> That also doesn't seem to be a regression, but it certainly wants a fix

[11:23] <jnthn> eveo: There's already an RT asking for that to be done totally differently anyway

[11:23] <eveo> OK

[11:23] <jnthn> So I'm not inclined to spend time on the current code for it.

[11:23] <eveo> Alright

[11:23] <jnthn> When it's getting tossed in the next week or so

[11:23] <jnthn> Hopefully not a blocker?

[11:23] <eveo> jnthn: and for the translate-nl thing... it only supposed to happen on utf8?

[11:24] <jnthn> No, it's supposed to happen on everything, but latin-1 takes a shortcut

[11:24] <jnthn> And misses the place where it happens

[11:24] <eveo> oh

[11:24] <jnthn> Just been looking at the code and seen why

[11:24] <lizmat> afk&

[11:24] <eveo> That's a blocker.

[11:25] <jnthn> Why? It's not a regression, it's been like that for months.

[11:25] <jnthn> I mean, I can put in a quick fix for it, but I hate doing those right before releases.

[11:27] <eveo> jnthn: it breaks precomp on Windows. IO::Path.slurp in latin1 now differs from IO::Handle.slurp in latin. And well, I could make IO::Path.slurp use IO::Handle.slurp for release, I guess, if it's more work trying to fix the latin for IO::Handle.slurp

[11:27] <eveo> I actually already got a commit locally doing that

[11:27] <jnthn> Ah, ok

[11:28] <jnthn> Wait, which one is correct?

[11:28] <eveo> IO::Path.slurp

[11:28] <eveo> C:\rakudo>perl6 -e "dd 'foo'.IO.slurp: :enc<iso-8859-1>; dd 'foo'.IO.open(:enc<iso-8859-1>).slurp"

[11:28] <eveo> "a\nb\n"

[11:28] <eveo> "a\r\nb\r\n"

[11:28] <llfourn> perl

[11:28] <eveo> It decodes manually and got a .substr on it

[11:29] <llfourn> (wrong window)

[11:29] <jnthn> Ah, right

[11:29] <eveo> while IO::Handle.slurp goes throw vmdecoder newline translator

[11:29] <jnthn> .subst?

[11:29] <eveo> .subt yeah

[11:29] <jnthn> Yeah, but we went through that decoder in previous releases too

[11:29] <jnthn> But maybe IO::Path.slurp was wrong also then

[11:30] <eveo> C:\rakudo-old>perl6 -e "dd 'foo'.IO.slurp: :enc<iso-8859-1>; dd 'foo'.IO.open(:enc<iso-8859-1>).slurp"

[11:30] <eveo> "a\r\nb\r\n"

[11:30] <eveo> "a\r\nb\r\n"

[11:30] <eveo> In past releases yeah, it was.

[11:30] <eveo> ^ that's 2017.04.3

[11:30] <eveo> So I was gonna make it ^ like that again, to unbust precomp

[11:31] <jnthn> Hm, so the inconsistency somehow busts precomp?

[11:31] <jnthn> Oddness

[11:31] <eveo> Yeah, in one place CompUnit code uses one .slurp and in the other, the other

[11:31] <eveo> And actually now there's a thrid place, that decodes manually

[11:31] <eveo> This one https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/575533866a816c7fd5c55451ea43d458a2ef0247

[11:32] <nine> jnthn: different places that calculate a checksum for the source file use different methods, so the checksum never matches and it recompiles again and again.

[11:32] <jnthn> oh, it's for a checksum

[11:32] <jnthn> Now it all makes sense :)

[13:23] <eveo> nine: did you upgrade to include latest nqp bump to fix the difference between ::Handle.slurp and ::Path.slurp?

[13:24] <eveo> nine: oh wait. No upgrade neede. ::Path.slurp translates newlines. Are you doing that in binary?

[13:24] <eveo> Oh wait. You're not on Windows :)

[13:25] * eveo shuts up and continues stresstesting

[13:25] <nine> eveo: no, I'm not. But it's not newlines (I'm on Linux anyway). It's the ∖ character. So reading latin-1 is not really equivalent to reading binary.

[13:25] <eveo> Weird

[13:49] <eveo> Not sure how to make it any faster there

[13:49] <eveo> And Rakudo::Internals.TRANSPOSE's guts is the code I used in 6788833bb8

[13:52] <jnthn> Well, just before release isn't the time, but I'm pretty sure I can figure out how to optimize subst(Str, Str) some :)

[13:52] <eveo> \o/

[13:53] * eveo afk for a bit

[13:54] <nine> jnthn: at least we now know that 1. adding a sha1 op for binary data won't buy us anything and 2. we couldn't do that anyway as it would break checksums of installed modules

[13:56] <lizmat> jnthn: re Str.subst(Str), faster than: nqp::join($final,nqp::split($original,$string)) ??

[14:10] <jnthn> lizmat: I don't think we can do that faster without VM-backing, but I meant faster than it is now

[14:10] <lizmat> Str.subst already checks for Str,Str and does a TRANSPOSE

[14:10] <lizmat> the only gain there is the cost of the named parameter handling

[14:11] <lizmat> *could be

[14:11] <lizmat> *reducing

[14:11] <jnthn> Yeah, but we could decide that with multi-dispatch instead :)

[14:11] <lizmat> yeah, I've worked on that already, but it becomes huge

[14:11] <lizmat> and as soon as regexes come into play, any gains are dwarved by the regex engine overhead

[14:12] <lizmat> so I abandoned that for the time being

[14:12] <jnthn> This is the non-regex case, though :)

[14:12] <jnthn> But yeah, fair enough

[14:12] <jnthn> Also until this week, spesh was less good at dealing with named parameters

[14:12] <jnthn> So the costs may have shifted a bit too

[14:12] <lizmat> jnthn: the point is that you cannot really handle 5 optional named parameters in dispatch

[14:13] <lizmat> as we don't have a signature for "no other named parameters"

[14:13] <lizmat> if we would have that, something like:

[14:13] <eveo> BTW, I think .subst(Str, Str) (no :g modifier) goes through regex path. Dunno if making it nqp::index would have any gains or whatever

[15:23] <eveo> stmuk: you could fix it for openbsd: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Kernel.pm#L104-L132

[15:24] <stmuk> sure .. gimme a min

[15:24] <eveo> hm... just did update-perl6 on local box and getting "/usr/bin/env: perl6#: No such file or directory" twice in the output at the end :/

[15:25] <eveo> wonder where that's from...

[15:25] <eveo> ohhh...

[15:26] <nine> Is there a way to get rid of rakudobrew on travis? I no longer have any reference to rakudobrew in my .travis.yml but it still gets used for installing rakudo

[15:26] <nine> eveo: seen the same message in Inline::Perl5's travis output

[15:26] <eveo> Yeah, something's got busted up. just running `zef` gives me that

[15:27] <eveo> nine: you could remove "language perl6". It's installed by default: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/perl6

[15:36] <eveo> Ah, ok, I see the problem

[15:36] <eveo> Wow, tests not catching it is scary :/

[15:39] <stmuk> eveo: I'm tempted to just use /bin/kill (which should exit on all UNIX systems) rather than detecting OpenBSD and acting differently... any strong views?

[15:39] <stmuk> s/exit/exist/

[15:40] <stmuk> its in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

[15:41] <eveo> Not my area of expertise, but if you're doing that for all unix system, then I'd prefer to do that after release

[15:42] <stmuk> ok I'll just special case OpenBSD (as is done already for other systems)

[15:42] <stmuk> the ubuntu fix looks very hacky :)

[15:46] <mst> eveo: I have the same issue with bash on debian

[15:47] <mst> so I suspect actually /bin/kill everywhere is a good idea

[15:47] <mst> there's probably other environments that have this bug

[16:38] <eveo> I don't get how Build.pm ends up coming up from a routine that looks for metafiles tho

[16:38] <eveo> And the same error existed 1 or 2 days ago

[16:39] <ugexe> maybe if you were fetching inline::perl5 from github

[16:39] <ugexe> which would be HEAD and not 0.16

[16:39] <ugexe> 0.26

[16:41] <eveo> weird. it just switches to 0.27 in the middle of the install process: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/07cf59226e172472f0481eb728d1dd2e

[16:43] <eveo> ugexe: this also works: zef --/cpan --/cached --debug install Inline::Perl5

[16:45] <eveo> Crypt::Bcrypt also uses Build.pm and installed with no issues. I guess there's nothing wrong with rakudo

[16:45] * eveo goes to take a nap and will release afterwards

[16:46] <ugexe> wonder if Inline::Perl5 is .tar.gz incorrectly

[16:47] <ugexe> compare against 0.26

[16:47] <ugexe> there is extra stuff in the root directory (that is also in the correct first subdir)

[16:53] <ugexe> yep

[16:53] <ugexe> zef install https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/archive/master.tar.gz

[16:53] <ugexe> works

[16:53] <ugexe> 0.27's .tar.gz archive is not the standard format

[16:54] <ugexe> nine: ^

[17:08] <ugexe> wonder if the inclusion of that manifest made cpan re-tar it differently than before, or if it was just an accident

[17:41] <nine> ugexe: what do you mean by "not the standard format"?

[17:49] <travis-ci> NQP build passed. pmurias '[jvm] Fixup test'

[17:49] <travis-ci> https://travis-ci.org/perl6/nqp/builds/244017602 https://github.com/perl6/nqp/compare/ed1a5d868ad4...6a5d316518bf

[17:56] <ugexe> nine: i just checked and if I view the 27.tar.gz in osx file manager it looks ok, but viewing it in windows 7zip the root path had copies of Inline-Perl5/examples|lib

[17:57] <ugexe> installation on linux failed, but works if i use a github .tar.gz of inline::Perl:ver<0.27>

[17:58] <ugexe> and standard format i mean inside the archive is a single folder which contains everything else

[17:59] <ugexe> but this has copies of some subfolders alongside (what is supposed to be) the single folder

[18:01] <nine> ugexe: I don't see that here, neither in the original .tar.gz nor in the one I downloaded from CPAN :/

[18:01] <nine> It may be some weird GNU tar extension

[18:04] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/f06fe6b58854f3ab237556aafc287835

[18:05] <ugexe> nine: this shows the problem as far as zef is concerned

[18:07] <geekosaur> looks like a version of tar that doesn't store directories

[18:10] <ugexe> fwiw that gist is the same for both bsd and gnu tar

[18:12] <geekosaur> ah, right. how is this being created?

[18:12] <geekosaur> because this is v7 tar format

[18:12] <geekosaur> which did not store directories

[18:12] <geekosaur> extracting it needs to be told that, or it will not create directories

[18:13] <ugexe> well nine presumably does it manually, but cpan also re-archives it I think?

[18:17] <travis-ci> Rakudo build failed. Zoffix Znet 'Optimize newline translation in IO::Path.slurp

[18:17] <travis-ci> https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/builds/243980050 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/compare/46eecdae8aea...6788833bb831

[18:17] <buggable> [travis build above] ✓ All failures are due to timeout (0), missing build log (0), GitHub connectivity (0), or failed make test (3). Across all jobs, only 04-nativecall/06-struct.t test file failed.

[18:20] <ugexe> this could also be fixed in zef, but we should still figure out why this happened in the first place

[18:23] <ugexe> fixing it in zef might be rather involved though to work with all the various formats, although I cant remember why. the problem re: zef is that it was able to know the first item listed could work for `my $root-dir = $save-as.IO.child(@files[0]);`

[18:24] <ugexe> e.g. figuring out where it will be extracted to before extracting it

[18:25] <geekosaur> well, having directories in the archive at all is not portable

[18:26] <ugexe> this is how other archives on cpan are

[18:26] <geekosaur> most extensions to basic tar format include them because you'd generally like to support directory permissions, but you should really support the case where they have been omitted for portability

[18:26] <ugexe> i suppose it could check that if A) the root dir is not listed and B) all files listed share a common rootdir. But if they don't all share a common root dir its back to not knowing what to do

[18:28] <geekosaur> I expect the correct thing to do in that case is fail because you do not have a proper package, unless you want to treat it as a stream format where it includes multiple packages

[18:29] <geekosaur> if cpan is repacking stuff then you probably need to look into recent changes to the server side of cpan

[18:29] <ugexe> im betting its because there is a manifest file now and *that* doesnt list that directory

[18:29] <ugexe> as in thats why it didnt get included all of a sudden

[18:29] <nine> ugexe: I guess it's because I used the --transform option to store the files in a sub directory

[18:32] <nine> ugexe: do you see any weirdness in this archive? http://niner.name/files/Inline-Perl5-0.27.tar.gz

[18:32] <ugexe> i wonder why 7zip trips up so badly on it

[18:37] <ugexe> nine: `zef --/wget install http://niner.name/files/Inline-Perl5-0.27.tar.gz` worked and the tar --list output looked like 0.26

[18:37] <ugexe> why I had to --/wget I dont know lol... it just freezes up

[18:42] <ugexe> nine: `wget http://niner.name/files/Inline-Perl5-0.27.tar.gz` doesnt work heh

[18:42] <ugexe> everything else works with it from what i can tell though

[18:43] <ugexe> probably an ip6 thing

[18:45] <ugexe> yeah... `wget -4 http://niner.name/files/Inline-Perl5-0.27.tar.gz` works

[18:52] <ugexe> is `$lock.protect({ $foo += 1 }); $lock.protect({ $foo += 1 });` the same as `$lock.lock; $foo += 1 $lock.unlock; $lock.lock; $foo += 1; $lock.unlock` ?

[18:53] <ugexe> e.g. does the second .protect lock the first .protect?

[18:53] <nine> yes

[18:54] <travis-ci> NQP build passed. pmurias 'Avoid manually numbering tests'

[18:54] <nine> So should I release an Inline::Perl5 0.28 with a fixed tar file?

[18:54] <ugexe> awesome, i saw all the code in CUR that implied such but I didn't know it worked like that

[18:55] <nine> Well src/core/Lock.pm is just 32 very readable lines :)

[18:56] <ugexe> nine: probably. i'm still going to try and make it handle that situation better but I have to test on each OS

[18:57] <nine> File successfully copied to '/home/ftp/incoming/Inline-Perl5-0.28.tar.gz'

[19:00] <ugexe> now I just need a trait or subtype that automatically locks/unlocks when reading/writing to a hash to skip all the additional $lock.protect: { }

[19:01] <nine> ugexe: https://github.com/jnthn/oo-monitors

[19:01] <nine> Ah, that's per method

[19:02] <ugexe> I suppose a proxy would work

[19:04] <ugexe> then again i remember proxy reads a bunch of times per access, which would probably make that super slow

[19:04] <ugexe> ...or deadlock heh

[19:06] <ugexe> I also probably need to expand that a bit to also allow a file lock type .protect

[19:32] <lizmat> eveo: good spot on the TRANSPOSE-ONE

[19:32] <lizmat> turns out I wrote it a long time ago, but never used it internally

[19:41] <dogbert17> lizmat: just added this, https://docs.perl6.org/type/Any#method_nodemap, do you see anything that should be added/removed?

[19:41] <lizmat> dogbert17: will check on a mp

[19:41] <lizmat> *mo

[19:42] <dogbert17> moritz has already helped out but perhaps there are more differences

[19:46] <BenGoldberg> It feels like all of those methods ought to be a single 'map' method, differentiated by :deep, :node, :duck

[19:56] * lizmat is still trying to grok deep node and duck

[19:58] <lizmat> TIL I learned the difference between map and nodemap: handling of slips

[19:59] * dogbert17 quacks

[19:59] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/50e9b6ec0a8db2f85339dc39fc63dd6d - heres a failing test, but not sure where to submit it since it will deadlock on rakudos prior to 2017.06

[20:07] <ugexe> when its incorrect the total size ends up being a few different values but some repeat more than others (like 262144)

[20:08] <ugexe> its always an even number

[20:09] <geekosaur> is it always a *power* of 2?

[20:10] <geekosaur> 262144 = 0x40000

[20:17] <ugexe> no - although some other less-occuring values have been 131072, 700672, 591040

[20:25] <ugexe> any idea how to at least tell if its the input or output thats getting lost?

[20:32] <geekosaur> replace «cat -» with «dd»

[20:32] <geekosaur> it will output summary statistics on stderr

[20:32] <lizmat> m: for ^100000 { 42 ~~ /^ <[0..9]> / }; say now - INIT now

[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9435c1: OUTPUT: «1.1948762␤»

[20:32] <lizmat> m: for ^100000 { 42 ~~ m/^ <[0..9]> / }; say now - INIT now   # what a difference a letter maketh

[20:32] <geekosaur> you may also want to experiment with the ibs and obs options, which might reveal buffering issues

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9435c1: OUTPUT: «9.173497␤»

[20:33] <lizmat> m: say 9.173497 / 1.1948762

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9435c1: OUTPUT: «7.67736189␤»

[20:37] <lizmat> looks like the m// version calls Str.match

[20:53] <lizmat> .tell [Tux] CSV can become a bit faster if you replace all m{} by //

[20:53] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to [Tux].

[20:55] <jnthn> Is there any reason we can't fix that in the compiler? :)

[20:57] <lizmat> jnthn: there may be a subtle difference about $/ being set / not set

[20:57] <jnthn> Hm, OK

[20:57] <lizmat> lemme check

[20:58] <lizmat> hmmm... no, that's not it

[20:59] <lizmat> looks like // calls Regex.ACCEPTS directly, and m// goes through Str.match

[20:59] <lizmat> anyways, keeping that until *after* the release for sure

[20:59] * lizmat already got burnt once today with a "simple" optimization  :-(

[20:59] <jnthn> :)

[22:23] <eveo> Reproed it immediatelly locally, then removed .precomp dirs and now it's not failing anymore

[22:25] <timotimo> perhaps CStruct is serializing/deserializing itself improperly? though that'd require the CStruct to be inside a precompiled module to mess anything up

[22:33] <eveo> Annoyingly can't repro it at all anymore. Though, I notice the travis whining is for commits before the "Fix regression in Str.subst(Str:D, Str:D)" commit

[22:42] <eveo> Also something makes tests in Concurrent::File::Find fail on HEAD, but not on 2017.05

[23:08] <eveo> That looks really fancy-pants.. :/

[23:09] <eveo> Maybe it's not meant to sink that map?

[23:11] <eveo> So it worked the new way for about a year

[23:12] <eveo> Crap. Should've looked at this toaster burn before napping :) Now everyone's gone :)

[23:26] <eveo> looks like it working was somewhat accidentall

[23:27] <committable6> eveo, ¦2017.05,HEAD(8074966): «1␤2»

[23:30] <eveo> Yeah. I guess I can leave it as is for release.

[23:32] <eveo> Tho looking at it it really should get sunk in that case, and thus .map be evaluated

[23:36] <eveo> samcv: flopping tests when stresstesting

[23:36] <eveo> the fail in the run, but then are OK when you run them again

[23:36] <samcv> which ones? or just lots of them?

[23:36] <samcv> yeah i know what flopping tests are.

[23:36] <eveo> Just in that file

[23:36] <samcv> ah you're just saying "these files have dflopping tests"

[23:36] <samcv> gotcha

[23:37] <eveo> k. that fixes the burn in Concurrent::File::Find

[23:39] <eveo> the burn with Event::Emitter looks to be just its own tests being racy and floppy

[23:41] <eveo> gonna run another toast run, just in case. The 2017.06 release is itching to be a lemon it seems :/

[23:48] <ugexe> whats wrong with pipe.t?

[23:49] * ugexe is still chasing https://gist.github.com/ugexe/50e9b6ec0a8db2f85339dc39fc63dd6d and wonder if it could be related

[23:49] <ugexe> on osx it always seems to work, but on a linux vm it fails 10-20 tests every time

[23:57] <eveo> ugexe: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-06-17#i_14746057

[23:58] <eveo> kinda sucks to release with that bug in, but I don't know how to fudge for it and proper fix will be done next week
