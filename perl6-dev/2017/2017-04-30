[08:54] <[Tux]> and my computer was not busy doing other stuff

[09:08] <lizmat> [Tux] could it be that you have a large .precomp dir ?

[09:09] <nine> lizmat: would that make any difference?

[09:09] <lizmat> well, in most OS's dir searches are still lineair

[09:10] <lizmat> I should say, filesystems

[09:10] <lizmat> if you have 1000's of .precomp entries

[09:10] <lizmat> that does make a difference

[09:10] <[Tux]> 290M    .precomp/

[10:10] <nine> I usually need to do that after updating nqp

[10:11] <pmurias> I hate Makefiles-- so much :(

[10:59] <jnthn> samcv: Discovered https://github.com/jnthn/p6-app-moarvm-heapanalyzer was still without one, so there we go... :-)

[11:21] <samcv> yay!

[11:21] <samcv> you win!

[11:21] <samcv> party time

[11:21] <jnthn> :-)

[11:21] <samcv> now we can say that *most* modules have license tags

[11:23] <timotimo> cool

[11:23] <timotimo> "your chance of a module having a license tag is better than 50/50!"

[11:25] <samcv> that is unproven.

[11:25] <samcv> though

[11:25] <samcv> but if you randomly install all modules then yes

[12:10] <dogbert17> does anyone know if slangs have a large overhead?

[12:11] <timotimo> i've never measured, but it shouldn't be terribly big

[12:11] <timotimo> and it's only compile-time overhead of course

[12:12] <dogbert17> I was looking at [Tux] csv code again, i.e. https://github.com/Tux/CSV/blob/master/test-t.pl

[12:12] <dogbert17> if you put an 'exit 0' at line 8 and then time the script I get 1.3 seconds

[12:13] <timotimo> and if you rewrite it to be untuxic?

[12:13] <dogbert17> I'd say one second faster

[12:14] <dogbert17> i.e. I removed the compilation errors I get when I remove the slang

[12:14] <timotimo> interesting

[12:15] <timotimo> wanna --profile-compile that?

[12:15] <dogbert17> is there a --profile-compile switch?

[12:16] <dogbert17> or do you mean perl6 -c --profile test-t ?

[12:16] <lizmat> m: Bag.new.roll   # hmmmm

[12:17] <SourceBaby> Zoffix, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/bdb5391/src/core/Baggy.pm#L498

[12:17] <timotimo> there is a --profile-compile switch

[12:17] <dogbert17> cool, didn't know that

[12:17] <lizmat> Zoffix: working on that

[12:17] <timotimo> :)

[12:18] <dogbert17> hmm, wrote perl6 --profile-compile test-t.pl    and now it hangs, maybe it's slow

[12:18] <timotimo> it's likely quite slow

[12:19] <dogbert17> I'll wait then :)

[12:19] <pmurias> is a raw » allowed in the comments and literals in the MoarVM source

[12:19] <timotimo> hopefully it won't blow up in memory usage and asplodes :)

[12:19] <timotimo> pmurias: i know nothing about the other C compilers we target :)

[12:19] <timotimo> but isn't » in latin1?

[12:20] <timotimo> m: say "»".ord

[12:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar bdb539: OUTPUT: «187␤»

[12:20] <timotimo> that should totally be fine

[12:21] <pmurias> timotimo: gcc handles that fine, I don't know what else are we using to compile on other despicable platforms

[12:22] <timotimo> hmm

[12:22] <timotimo> well, you know, we're using {} and other kinds of parenthesis without using trigraphs

[12:22] <timotimo> i think a latin1 character should be fine

[12:25] <Zoffix> kinda weird $*SPEC.curupdir is a `none`, rather than `any` Junction; considering .curdir and .updir are strings '

[12:25] <Zoffix> '.' and '..'

[12:28] <timotimo> right, that must be because it was originally used as the test for dir?

[12:28] <timotimo> which of course could also have used none(any(...)) rather than just the any from curupdir

[12:28] <timotimo> or, you know, none(|$*SPEC.curupdir)

[12:33] <dogbert17> timotimo: the routines with the largest exclusive times are: mergesubstates (17.99), mergesubrule (14.85) and addedge (14.52)

[12:33] <dogbert17> these are percentages btw

[12:34] <timotimo> oh, yikes, why isn't the result of that precompiled?

[12:34] <MasterDuke_> dogbert17: was that for a clean (i.e, hadn't been compiled before) run?

[12:35] <timotimo> or is Slang::Tuxic exporting a "no precompilation" thing?

[12:35] <dogbert17> I had run it before but I could try again

[12:35] <dogbert17> https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Tuxic/blob/master/lib/Slang/Tuxic.pm

[12:36] <timotimo> i'unno

[12:39] * dogbert17 runs again with --profile-compile

[12:40] <dogbert17> 1.3 secs to get the code running is quite much, perhaps it's different on 64 bit systems

[12:41] <timotimo> well, we have the jit there, so that's something

[12:41] <lizmat> feels to me the 1.3 is mostly Slang::Tuxic causing a redo of the grammar

[12:42] <timotimo> hm. i wonder if a manual call to precompute_nfas would help

[12:42] <timotimo> it's a private method on a Grammar

[12:43] <timotimo> perhaps that could go into define_slang

[12:44] <dogbert17> lizmat: but if it takes the same time on [Tux] machine then that's 20 % of the total execution time

[12:45] <lizmat> dogbert17: have you tried removing Slang::Tuxic from test-t.pl ?

[12:46] <lizmat> looks like it doesn't need it

[12:46] <dogbert17> I do get compilation errors if I remove it

[12:46] <lizmat> you do ?

[12:46] <lizmat> hmmm

[12:47] <Zoffix> I wanna add a mode argument to nqp::open(). Right now we have no core way to securely create files.

[12:47] <Zoffix> And add a :chmode arg to IO::Handle.open.... :mode would be nice, but it's already taken up :/

[12:48] <Zoffix> I mean :chmod

[12:48] <timotimo> opening and at the same time (?) changing the permission flags?

[12:48] <dogbert17> lizmat: two terms in a row on e.g.         $sum = [+] $csv.getline_all ($*IN)».map(*.elems);

[12:49] <Zoffix> timotimo: just giving different mode to libuv than DEFAULT_MODE

[12:49] <lizmat> yeah... seeing now too, wonder what happened before

[12:49] <timotimo> mhm

[12:49] <Zoffix> timotimo: I'd hope there's no "changing" but rather the file is created in the given permissions from the start

[12:49] <timotimo> ah

[12:49] <Zoffix> Otherwise there's still a security issue

[12:51] <lizmat> dogbert17: rewriting test-t.pl to plain Perl 6 saves me 13% (3877 -> 3406 msecs)

[12:51] <dogbert17> that's quite a savings

[12:52] <lizmat> it *would* bring it below 5 seconds again  :-)

[12:52] <dogbert17> but I seem to remember that [Tux] wanted his slang

[12:52] <[Tux]> correct. no slang = no Text::CSV (at least not by me)

[12:52] <lizmat> yeah, but one could argue that's not needed in the test file

[12:53] <lizmat> [Tux]: I mean, test-t.pl is like a user file, and a user would most likely *not* use Slang::Tuxic

[12:53] <[Tux]> lizmat, I agree: but if it surfaces additional problems, the canary lives happily everafter

[12:53] <lizmat> so I think it would be fair to remove Slang::Tuxic from test-t

[12:53] <[Tux]> lizmat, unless the user is me :)

[12:54] <lizmat> well, we could make a test-tuxic.pl  :-)

[12:54] <timotimo> [Tux]: how many lines is hello.csv supposed to have so i get the same workload as you?

[12:54] <jnthn> Or try to figure out why Slang::Tuxic requires `no precompilation`, if that's the issue? :)

[12:54] <Zoffix> huggable: bench csv

[12:54] <huggable> Zoffix, export PATH=`pwd`/install/bin:$PATH; cd CSV; for i in $(seq 1 10000); do echo 'hello,","," ",world,"!"'; done > /tmp/hello.csv; time perl6 -Ilib -MText::CSV test-t.pl </tmp/hello.csv

[12:54] <Zoffix> timotimo: ^

[12:54] <timotimo> it doesn't have "no precompilation", though

[12:54] <Zoffix> (ignore the export part)

[12:54] <timotimo> ah

[12:56] <dogbert17> on my system I get (test-t) real 0m8.859s, (test-no-tuxic) real 0m7.871s # this is a crappy i5 660

[12:58] <jnthn> Ah, OK

[12:58] <lizmat> m: say 8859 / 7871

[12:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar bdb539: OUTPUT: «1.125524␤»

[12:58] <lizmat> yeah, that's about what I saw

[12:58] <timotimo> hm. i added precompute_nfas to define_slang but it didn't make mergesubstates/optimize/mergesubrule/addedge disappear from the top of the routines tab

[12:58] <timotimo> it does have precompute_nfas in it, at the 5th spot, and it takes 73% of total run time

[12:59] <timotimo> er, total compile time

[13:00] * dogbert17 is now grammar expert so https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Tuxic/blob/master/lib/Slang/Tuxic.pm does not give me any clues

[13:00] <dogbert17> s/now/no/ :)

[13:02] <timotimo> dogbert17: It is like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

[13:03] <timotimo> (the finger is Slang::Tuxic, the moon is rakudo's and nqp's innards)

[13:03] <dogbert17> ah

[13:08] <dogbert17> so IS Slang::Tuxic precompiled?

[13:10] <lizmat> yes

[13:10] <lizmat> afaik

[13:10] <lizmat> and Text::CSV as well

[13:10] <lizmat> afaik

[13:12] <dogbert17> so it might be the 'redoing of the grammar' which takes up the time then, like you wrote earlier

[13:14] <lizmat> m: say now - BEGIN now; sub postfix:<!>(\a) { a }   # the cost of rewriting the grammar

[13:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar bdb539: OUTPUT: «0.28916266␤»

[13:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar bdb539: OUTPUT: «0.0146918␤»

[13:15] <lizmat> prefix:<!> exists in core, postfix:<!> doesn't

[13:15] <pmurias> jnthn: I made a pull request to fix the str to num conversion

[13:16] <pmurias> jnthn: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/559078

[14:04] <lizmat> [Tux]: I think it would only be unfair if you were the only user of Text::CSV, which I sincerely hope is *not* the case

[14:05] <lizmat> afaik, test-t is about testing Text::CSV performance, not Slang::Tuxic performance

[14:08] <dogbert17> lizmat++, [Tux]++

[14:09] <dogbert17> at least we now have an idea as to the current compile/execution overhead wrt Slang::Tuxic

[14:10] <lizmat> $ 6 ''

[14:10] <lizmat> real	0m0.120s

[14:10] <lizmat> $ 6 'use Slang::Tuxic'

[14:10] <lizmat> real	0m0.557s

[14:10] <[Tux]> lizmat, I mean that it now *looks* like the speed improved, but nothing changed

[14:11] <[Tux]> and there still remains the undelying performance loss of using a slang in two layers

[14:11] <lizmat> [Tux]: two layers ?

[14:11] <lizmat> there is only a compile time performance issue

[14:12] <lizmat> since we don't pre-compile the script, we see that in every run

[14:12] <[Tux]> Text::CSV already uses Slang::Tuxic, so I see no reason why having the calling script also using Slang::Tuxic causes that much overhead

[14:12] <[Tux]> ah, oké, that explains

[14:12] <lizmat> because the precomped version of Text::CSV doesn't need It anymore

[14:12] <[Tux]> right

[14:17] <timotimo> right, removing Slang::Tuxic from the rest of Text::CSV will not have a performance impact on test-t performance

[14:18] <timotimo> anyway, ideally we'd be able to just re-use the precompiled result of Perl6::Grammar + Slang::Tuxic::Grammar and then the performance hit on test-t would be gone regardless of using Slang::Tuxic or not

[14:23] <lizmat> timotimo: I'm not seeing how you could merge the precomped Grammars

[14:24] <timotimo> hm. because the EXPORT is run every time the user script is run?

[14:25] <timotimo> you're right, there's nothing we could really do about that :\

[14:25] * lizmat would have loved to be proved wrong

[14:26] <timotimo> a little spark of hope was to check if what we're being passed is the pristine Perl6::Grammar and just return a pre-made one from a module we've precomped

[14:26] <timotimo> but i don't think we can just change the type from underneath the instance?

[14:26] <timotimo> i mean, we do have a type change thing that exists. not sure if that'd work here

[14:27] * lizmat neither  :-)

[14:29] <timotimo> of course, test-t could become a module that just gets used and it'd do its thing in the mainline :)

[14:32] <lizmat> yes, but *that* feels like cheating, as we lose the compile overhead of test-t altogether then

[14:32] <timotimo> yes

[14:32] <lizmat> Text::CSV is typically used in one/few-off situations

[14:32] <timotimo> it'll give an unexplained change in all timings

[14:33] <lizmat> if anything, perhaps we should deduct .3 from all measurements so far

[14:33] <timotimo> mayhaps

[14:33] <timotimo> anyway, the whole mergesubrules and stuff business can become faster from a thing TT has been pondering

[14:34] <timotimo> so maybe we'll get to chop a few second-parts from compile time there

[14:34] <lizmat> that would be brill  :-)

[14:37] <dogbert17> as far as the rest of the code I remember [Tux] pointing to the slowness of the NEXT phasers

[15:38] <[Tux]> dogbert17, that is because return/next/last is handled as exception (as jnthn explained), so only an optimizer can be used to boost the use of next

[15:39] <[Tux]> where a relatively simple looking loop using next and last to jump out of it can be re-written to be a huge if/else tree

[21:50] <lizmat> hmmm.... Geth and/or GitHub a little slow

[21:51] <lizmat> anyways, I've just committed https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a2602b9cee60f746b601

[21:51] <MasterDuke_> gfldex was mentioning in #perl6 that he was testing github's api today and it was very slow and causing retries

[21:51] <timotimo> https://status.github.com/

[21:51] <timotimo> you see that?

[21:52] <lizmat> yeah, looks all green no?

[21:52] <timotimo> "time to first byte" went up to almost 20 seconds (or is that just 2s?)

[21:52] <lizmat> looks like it peaked just below 4 secs

[21:53] <timotimo> right, not 20 %)

[21:53] <lizmat> but mean hook delivery time is still < 1 second

[21:53] <lizmat> so maybe Geth has an issue ?

[22:00] <lizmat> anyways, looking at Baggy.grab(*)

[22:01] <lizmat> currently, that's eager

[22:01] <lizmat> I'm thinking of making it lazy, and having it return a Seq

[22:05] <timotimo> hmm

[22:05] <timotimo> so as you're iterating over the list, the bag slowly gets mutated?

[22:10] <lizmat> yeah, so I'm not sure whether that would be a bug or a feature

[22:10] <lizmat> I mean, if you want immediate removal, then make it eager :-)

[22:10] <lizmat> docs don't state anything about laziness

[22:11] <lizmat> specs also don't say anything about laziness

[22:13] <timotimo> right

[22:14] <timotimo> interesting little tidbit

[22:14] <lizmat> I could see uses for a lazy grab

[22:14] <timotimo> yeah

[22:14] <timotimo> kind of

[22:14] <lizmat> anyways, I will sleep on it...

[22:14] <lizmat> enough hacking today...

[22:14] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev!
