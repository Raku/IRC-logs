[19:57] <lizmat> sorry [Coke]: I just hear it was someone else who needed nudging first :-)

[20:04] <ufobat> why do some parts in rakudo use (a regular) if where other parts use nqp::if?

[20:08] <moritz> mostly a question of performance

[20:08] <moritz> Perl 6 "if" coerces the condition to a Bool

[20:11] <ufobat> ty :)

[20:19] <Zoffix> huh? What do you mean? Doesn't `if ... {}` compile to nqp::if?

[20:20] <jnthn> Yes. The performance differences are more in the block/introduction of an extra scope

[20:21] <Zoffix> Yeah. Also, in some places an `nqp::if` instead of an `if {}` is used likely 'cause there's other nqp code used. It keeps it consistent and looks prettier to have just pure NQP nest

[22:37] <Zoffix> thundergnat: thanks. Typo fixed in sources; will update repo later. For bikeshedding: "substantially shorter" is too vague a quantity. "Half the size" is a measure I heard several times and matches my most scientific measurement of converting my own code.

[22:40] <thundergnat> Zoffix Yeah, substantially does sound kind-of like a weasel word. "Half the size" reads much better than "twice shorter"

[22:42] <Zoffix> thundergnat: changed it to: "Many programmers report their programs become up to half the size, when converted from other languages to Perl 6, without sacrificing legibility."

[22:43] <thundergnat> Zoffix++

[22:45] <Zoffix> ufobat: won't have time to review it today, but briefly looking at the code, I wonder two things: (1) why is the volume being checked on every loop iteration; shouldn't it be just set by shifting from the list (while checking there's stuff to shift) before the loop? Also: what happens with the $!CWD attribute of the resultant path? Looks like here it's just being set to `$sep`, which would end up as just

[22:45] <Zoffix> `\` without a volume on Windows, won't it? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1249/files#diff-13f6575d865e3d4c43a478dfcb4ea969R332
