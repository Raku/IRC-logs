[02:01] <samcv> [18:59:48] <samcv> why didn't we bump the subversion for nqp and moarvm again... cause 2017.04.3 requires a newer version of moarvm and nqp, and moarvm and nqp only have tags up to 2017.04.3

[02:01] <samcv> i'm trying to get gentoo's version bumped and trying to see what happened Zoffix so 2017.04.2 and .1 didn't need any changes to nqp and moarvm?

[02:02] <samcv> and then we didn't bump the moarvm and nqp version when 2017.04.3 was released?

[05:57] <lizmat> Files=1192, Tests=58579, 210 wallclock secs (12.67 usr  4.60 sys + 1243.96 cusr 115.61 csys = 1376.84 CPU)

[07:28] * lizmat waves from the PTS in Lyon

[07:30] * brrt waves from AMS

[08:26] <lizmat> so I want to add the information contained in nqp/gen/moar/stage1/nqp-config.nqp as part of the perl6 -V output

[08:26] <lizmat> something like:

[08:27] <lizmat> nqp::version=2017.04-96-g9763728

[08:29] <lizmat> so I wonder if I need to require that file, and then run hll_config(my %h)

[08:46] <samcv> lizmat, are you against us making tags for nqp and moarvm that match with 2017.04.3 ?

[08:47] <samcv> since the newest tag is not new enough for 2017.04.3

[08:47] <samcv> which was not the case for 2017.04.2 which didn't need any change to moar

[08:53] <lizmat> I have nothing against that, but then I'm really the worst person to ask

[08:53] <lizmat> you probably want to check with moritz [Coke] timotimo

[08:54] <lizmat> ok: different approach

[08:54] <lizmat> I would like to have "perl6 -V" call something from the setting

[08:55] <lizmat> my 'nqp' fu is not strong enough

[08:55] <lizmat> I know I need to do something in nqp/src/HLL/Compiler.nqp

[08:55] <lizmat> inside "verbose_config"

[08:55] <lizmat> but I seem to be missing some crucial parts of information there

[08:57] <samcv> trying to add more info there?

[08:57] <samcv> or have it cause side effects

[08:59] <lizmat> more info: basically nqp / kernel / distro info

[08:59] <lizmat> probably also the $*REPO chain

[09:00] <lizmat> for CPAN-testers

[09:00] <lizmat> so we can get all of the applicable information of a Perl 6 module test report to the author of the module in case of faiulure

[09:01] <lizmat> *failure  :-)

[09:02] <samcv> :)

[09:02] <samcv> all the info I said i wanted ALL the info

[09:02] <jnthn> lizmat: I think there's an nqp::backendconfig op or so that this info can be pulled out of

[09:02] <samcv> i think i've called that before

[09:02] <samcv> but that just dumps them right

[09:02] <jnthn> oh

[09:02] <jnthn> And

[09:02] <jnthn> nqp --show-config

[09:02] <jnthn> perl6 --show-config

[09:02] <jnthn> :)

[09:02] <samcv> she wanted to add info though?

[09:02] <jnthn> Dumps all of them

[09:03] <samcv> or she wanted to *get* that info

[09:03] <jnthn> samcv: The op gives back a hash

[09:03] <samcv> that is shown with perl6 -V from inside perl 6

[09:03] <samcv> yeah i know i've used it :)

[09:03] <jnthn> So you can do what you like with it

[09:03] <samcv> sorry i think i was thinking the opposite thing.  she wanted to add information that you would see additional info with perl6 -V

[09:04] * jnthn re-reads it all :)

[09:04] <jnthn> hah, right

[09:09] <jnthn> huh, I thought we wired that up, maybe not

[09:09] <jnthn> Anyway, if the NQP::Compiler object can somehow be loaded then it's available through .config on that, it seems

[09:16] <nine> [Tux]: any new timings? :)

[09:18] <lizmat> jnthn: well we would also like to add $*KERNEL and $*DISTRO info

[09:19] <lizmat> or are you saying that's all in there also ?

[09:19] <lizmat> if so, why are we using `uname` in various parts of Kernel.pm

[09:20] <jnthn> It calls uname? Hm :)

[09:20] <jnthn> heh

[09:20] <jnthn> Well, calling that from in Perl6::Compiler should be relatively easy

[09:20] <jnthn> There's a .eval method available on that object

[09:21] <jnthn> So can just self.eval('$*KERNEL') or similar

[09:21] <jnthn> (Sorry, bit tied up to look up exact naming)

[09:21] <lizmat> ok, gotcha

[09:21] <lizmat> so that would load the setting ?

[09:22] <jnthn> Yeah

[10:06] <Zoffix> samcv: right, .1 and .2 didn't need bumps, .3 mistakenly forgot the bumps

[10:07] <samcv> ok. i can tag moarvm and nqp. should i do 2017.04.3 ? that should be easiest for people to follow right

[10:08] <Zoffix> samcv: there's no point. It'd require a .4 release of Rakudo and we're not making one

[10:08] <samcv> would it?

[10:08] <samcv> can't we just tag the repos?

[10:08] <samcv> you can tag previous commits

[10:08] <Zoffix> samcv: what would be the point of those tags?

[10:09] <samcv> those are tags that are the release designated by 2017.04.3

[10:09] <Zoffix> samcv: nope

[10:10] <samcv> the tags of where moarvm and nqp are as required by 2017.04.3 that is

[10:10] <samcv> it's weird that nqp and moarvm have no tags new enough for 2017.04.3

[10:11] <samcv> it's a distinct release marker

[10:11] <Zoffix> samcv: 2017.04.3 doesn't refer to 2017.04.3 tags; which is why you'd need yet another point release to fix it

[10:11] * Zoffix thought the .04 release fiasco business was behind us

[10:11] <samcv> we have 2017.04.3 tag in rakudo yes?

[10:11] <Zoffix> Yes

[10:11] <samcv> but there are no nqp or moarvm tags new enough to meet the requirements

[10:12] <Zoffix> What requirement?

[10:12] <samcv> that 2017.04.3 requires

[10:12] <Zoffix> It doesn't require 2017.04.3

[10:12] <samcv> you can tag any commit you want does't have to be the current commit. tags are seperate from the commits themselves

[10:12] <Zoffix> Looks at build/tools/NQP_VERSIOn

[10:12] <samcv> i know it doesn't

[10:13] <samcv> that what we should tag nqp as 2017.04.3 because the newest tag for nqp is not new enough to satisfy rakudo's nqp dependency

[10:14] <Zoffix> Or we could wait 1 week and forget about it and not mess with .04 release 4 weeks after it happened

[10:15] <Zoffix> because you'd be taging a non-release with a release tag

[10:15] <samcv> hm

[10:16] <samcv> i suppose so. maybe can add some comment in the release info for 2017.04.3 and mention the tags needed for nqp and moarvm

[10:17] <samcv> that would be ok with me. then we have it at least documented on the announcement page that it requires those tags.

[10:18] <samcv> Zoffix, does that sound alright with you? i can add the tags to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/announce/2017.04.3.md and leave it at that?

[10:18] <Zoffix> Go for it

[10:18] <samcv> ok cool

[11:35] <tadzik> ah shite

[12:00] <tadzik> and yeah, with it removed it works

[12:00] <timotimo> comment out the line starting with SIGNAL and that has "tap" in it

[12:00] <timotimo> yeah, known bug: profiler explodes when you have multithreading active

[12:03] <tadzik> I see

[12:07] <timotimo> i mean ... instead of waiting longer to get tuits to fix that, we could output a warning where it would try to collect the data "threads were active. program is likely to crash, or profile is likely to be garbage"

[14:32] <jnthn> We may need some rules around that to allow less duplicate work

[14:33] <Zoffix> There's a related ticket: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127064#ticket-history

[14:33] <jnthn> For that case I think you get a significant speedup by typing the variable

[14:34] <jnthn> m: my $a = 'foo'; for ('a' x 100

[14:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 94c4e7: OUTPUT: «0.0238258␤»

[14:35] <jnthn> Hmm, I'm sure there was something like that

[14:36] <Zoffix> Wouldn't it still be mutable? Like it could change on every iteration

[14:36] <jnthn> Yeah, but it could call !LITERAL instead of !INTERPOLATE and avoid a check each time

[14:41] <timotimo> why do we get so bad performance in that regex even though it starts with a literal?

[14:43] <timotimo> hm, perhaps it'd be better to use ||@a there?

[14:49] <Zoffix> apparently-equivalent but 70x slower

[14:50] <timotimo> well well, we still have a lot of opportunities to improve these things

[14:50] * Zoffix files this one to keep a record

[14:50] <timotimo> also, we could totally have a special case for Range objects in the regex engine

[14:51] <timotimo> but that doesn't help your case at all

[14:51] <Zoffix> There isn't a range there tho.

[14:51] <timotimo> because you wanted an array of words

[14:51] <timotimo> @a = 1..12

[14:51] <timotimo> if you used $a instead, that'd be a different story

[14:51] <timotimo> and the @$a in the regex?

[14:53] <Zoffix> filed as https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131297

[15:01] <timotimo> Zoffix: if you know you're looking for single words from an array, you could \w+ and check the values in a <?{ ... }>, wouldn't that perform better?

[15:01] <tadzik> Zoffix: seems like I got it to work: http://imgur.com/a/LAaIG though it should probably not be so user-exposed

[15:02] <Zoffix> timotimo: I just replaced it with literals and was done with it. It's a one-off script to update filenames

[15:02] <timotimo> have a little "developer mode" button at the bottom like the docs have

[15:02] <timotimo> ah, i didn't realize

[15:02] <tadzik> maybe something like modules.perl6.org/problems-for/tadzik, which would just show me what I can fix in my stuf

[15:03] <Zoffix> I just mentioned it 'cause it was proper production use of Perl 6 and I hit something that was LTA :)

[15:03] <timotimo> that's fair

[15:03] <Zoffix> tadzik: that looks awesome :)

[15:05] <tadzik> :3

[15:15] <Zoffix> .tell curt_ Our modules.perl6.org currently rejects logotypes that aren't 32x32px. Sent you a PR to fix yours: https://github.com/CurtTilmes/perl6-eredis/pull/1

[15:15] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to curt_.

[15:16] <Zoffix> nine: if you're short on topics to talk about at PTS... we support these "logotypes" on modules.perl6.org but AFAIK they're entirely unspecced.

[15:16] <tadzik> Zoffix: we could use Imager to resize them on the spot, would that be desirable>?

[15:17] <tadzik> or Imagemagick or whatever else

[15:21] <Zoffix> tadzik: feels like the wrong approach. We'd just be masking the problem instead of fixing it, especially since the filename has "32x32" in it. In the 800+ dists, this is only the second time a non-standard sized logotype appeared

[15:22] <tadzik> ah, indeed. So it declares 32x32, but isn't, that's a Problem

[15:22] <tadzik> something to put on the Problems list :P

[16:17] <lizmat> so what's so special about val() that we don't have a proto sub val() in the setting, and we *do* have multi sub val()'s ?

[16:22] <Zoffix> s: &val

[16:22] <SourceBaby> Zoffix, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/53df2aa/src/core/allomorphs.pm#L119

[16:22] * Zoffix shrugs

[16:22] <Zoffix> That would normally lead to a proto

[16:24] * Zoffix stabs in the dark and guesses the proto for it is made somewhere in the grammar because it uses val() to do things, doesn't it?

[16:26] <lizmat> could be

[16:28] <Zoffix> I think it using &val here... https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L9433

[16:29] <lizmat> yeah, but where does the proto live?

[16:29] <lizmat> ah well, taking a different approach

[17:07] <dogbert17> Zoffix or lizmat: are you around?

[17:07] <Zoffix> dogbert17: sup?

[17:07] <dogbert17> does https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/29095e6418272518295b47c5aa9de53a look ok'ish?

[17:08] <dogbert17> tested in S32-container/buf.t

[17:10] <Zoffix> dogbert17: looks good to me. That goes into  doc/Type/Blob.pod6, right?

[17:10] <dogbert17> yup :)

[17:10] <lizmat> dogbert17:

[17:11] <lizmat> if you call it on a Buf, you get a Buf returned

[17:11] <lizmat> m: say Buf.new([1, 2, 3]).reverse

[17:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 53df2a: OUTPUT: «Buf:0x<03 02 01>␤»

[17:11] <lizmat> m: say Blob.new([1, 2, 3]).reverse

[17:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 53df2a: OUTPUT: «Blob:0x<03 02 01>␤»

[17:11] <lizmat> not sure if that pod covers Buf as well

[17:12] <dogbert17> there's a separate pod for that

[17:12] <dogbert17> But I guess that I could put a 'copy' there as well

[17:13] * Zoffix would just replace one of those Blob examples with a Buf

[17:13] <Zoffix> ('cause Buf does Blob)

[17:13] <dogbert17> that can be arranged
