[00:00] <IOninja> I stresstest with it installed yesterday...

[00:00] * IOninja tries the latest and greatest version

[00:00] <TimToady> might've been residual precomp stuff from braids...

[00:02] <TimToady> no, trying to reinstall Inline::Perl5 then

[00:02] <TimToady> nope, fails

[00:03] <TimToady> gets failures like:

[00:03] <TimToady> # Failed test 'parse :from<Perl5> syntax'

[00:03] <TimToady> # at t/spec/S01-perl-5-integration/import.t line 17

[00:03] <TimToady> # Error: Type check failed in binding to $handle; expected CompUnit::Handle but got Sub (sub EXPORT (*@args) {...)

[00:03] <TimToady> nine: ^^ does this ring any bells, other than alarm?  :)

[00:07] <IOninja> oh... I think I recall someone having that issue in #perl6 :o

[00:07] <TimToady> I confess, I'm glad that it didn't turn out to be my braids branches, but this is probably a release showstopper

[00:08] <IOninja> Yeah. I should've thought to test a fresh clone in pre-release preparations >_<

[00:08] <TimToady> if you look at the code, the .release method is definitely trying to return a sub, not a CompUnit

[00:09] <TimToady> so the binder has a valid complaint

[00:19] <IOninja> well, don't see any I::Perl5 fails, but t/spec/S17-channel/stress.t hung again. Waited 3 minutes. When run alone it usually completes 11-40secs

[00:19] <IOninja> grrrr... and it finishes just as I finish typing that -_-

[00:19] <IOninja> All tests successful.

[00:19] <IOninja> Files=1225, Tests=132898, 313 wallclock secs (21.33 usr  3.30 sys + 5553.67 cusr 325.51 csys = 5903.81 CPU)

[00:19] <IOninja> Result: PASS

[00:20] <IOninja> TimToady: ^ I didn't get any failures with a fresh clone of everything

[00:20] <TimToady> using zef?

[00:20] <IOninja> No, panda. Just copy-pasting step 12 of release guide: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/release_guide.pod

[00:20] <TimToady> maybe I should try a realclean

[00:20] <TimToady> or panda...

[00:23] <TimToady> which version does panda install?  zeg gets 0.13

[00:23] <TimToady> *zef

[00:24] <IOninja> Not sure. I've just nuked everything and gonna try zef. I'd guess it installs latest

[00:27] <TimToady> heh, panda fails to install I::P5 because LibraryMake is already install, which is a bit antisocial

[00:29] <TimToady> would be nice if panda mentioned which version it is installing...

[00:31] * TimToady notes that the last entry in 'git log' in .zef's I::P5 directory has a date of Sep 19

[00:31] <TimToady> now where does panda keep stuff?...

[00:32] <IOninja> no idea

[00:32] <TimToady> btw, panda-installed I::P5 seems to work better

[00:34] <TimToady> so looks like zef is just not installing the latest, for some reason

[00:38] <TimToady> now if only I could figure out a way to get Inline::Perl5 to actually tell me what version it is...

[00:41] <IOninja> installed 0.23 I::P5 with zef... All tests pass. Files=1225, Tests=132898, 137 wallclock secs (20.93 usr  3.03 sys + 2797.51 cusr 278.02 csys = 3099.49 CPU)

[00:42] <IOninja> Pretty sure there's a Comp::Unit incantation that let's you look at meta file

[00:44] <IOninja> `zef info Inline::Perl5` tells the version

[00:47] <TimToady> zef install 0.13, panda installs 0.23

[00:47] <TimToady> slight difference there...

[00:49] <TimToady> okay, so maybe I can test I::P5 with braids now, yay

[03:24] <ugexe> TimToady: `zef update && zef install Inline::Perl5` (like apt-get), or `zef install "Inline::Perl5:ver<0.22>"` `zef install "github:niner:Inline-Perl5:0.22"`  should work

[08:49] <NeuralAnomaly> samcv, [✘] Next release is today. Since last release, there are 48 new still-open tickets (1 unreviewed and 0 blockers) and 13 unreviewed commits. See http://perl6.fail/release/stats for details

[13:19] <nine> How on earth is it possible that two type objects from two different precompiled modules share the same SC object?

[13:19] <nine> But only if they have the same short name

[14:17] <nine> What the? Though it's the type objects that share the SC, the exported subs seem to be the cause of the sharing.

[14:17] <nine> When I give the subs different names, the type objects suddenly get different SCs.

[14:18] <nine> Talking about https://gist.github.com/ugexe/b8ac60d26a17d2c256c41f62e9716d96 btw. In case anyone's actually reading this ;)

[14:23] <IOninja> well, I'm reading but only in the context of "does impact today's release?" :)

[14:23] <nine> Ooooh....it's not actually the name of the exported sub. It's that both modules have identical source. Even adding a comment to one of them fixes the issue.

[14:23] <IOninja> ooh :)

[19:46] <TimToady> now that the release is out, I'm going to merge braids, so expect a bit of instability and/or warnings from slang modules

[19:46] <TimToady> (just doing a final spectest first)

[19:46] <IOninja> \o/

[19:47] <TimToady> if you have any code that depends on %*PRAGMAS or $*ACTIONS, it'll break

[19:47] <TimToady> if you have code that sets %*LANG from a use, it'll emulate and warn

[19:47] <TimToady> since that's mostly all that slang modules do

[19:48] <TimToady> so, for instance, expect Slang::Tuxic to issue a warning about use of %*LANG

[19:57] <ugexe> zef auto-update (a default setting to update the ecosystem list each run) is fixed now. It was a poorly written conditional at fault, not the cache for once... https://github.com/ugexe/zef/commit/65e970bd6e5f08295a4d1b5d4b9e861c0b32b898

[19:58] <ugexe> it *was* auto updating... but only if the package list file didn't exist yet

[20:07] <TimToady> that's the braids merge

[20:08] <IOninja> \o/

[20:10] <TimToady> note that pre/post-braids nqp will not interoperate with post/pre-braids rakudo, so you gotta update both

[20:11] <TimToady> also note this is not primarily an optimization upgrade, but a semantic hygiene upgrade, so speed differences will be close to a wash

[20:12] <TimToady> it is likely to make some optimizations easier in the future however, and puts the responsibility for adjudicating a lot of the slang changes into the cursor

[20:13] <TimToady> (there are still a few things that might go into the braid, such as %*HOW)

[20:15] <TimToady> it'll also run slightly faster once we strip out the old %*LANG apparatus

[20:42] <jnthn> TimToady: I figure there's a migration path for things that were playing around with %*LANG?

[20:45] <jnthn> TimToady: Seems there's a left-behind printf in HLL::Compiler in the NQP merge

[20:48] <TimToady> if a slang module also does the equivalent $*LANG.define_slang, it should suppress the warning.  obviously, would have to be in a try to support backward compat

[20:49] <jnthn> *nod*

[20:49] <jnthn> Yeah, think I can see how the new way works :)

[20:49] <jnthn> I think my only module that uses %*LANG was Grammar::Generative, which busted long ago in a different way anyway

[20:50] <TimToady> well, it's just one of those hang-on-the-right-peg things to me, where parallel dynvars are a smell, much like parallel arrays smell compared to OO

[20:51] <jnthn> Yeah, it feels like an improvement to me :)

[20:51] <TimToady> I'm a little unhappy to duplicate LANG as LEAF part of the time, but $*W doesn't always get the current cursor

[20:52] <TimToady> and sometimes it has to be the current cursor rather than the current "official" language

[20:58] <TimToady> oh, I should mention $*PACKAGE is in the braid now too, in case anyone runs into that, though we still have an epiphenomenal $*PACKAGE for reading at the momemt.  $?PACKAGE is unaffected, of course, since that's user API

[21:01] <TimToady> and $?LANG is no longer actually poked into the lexical scope, cuz that's what caused it to try to serialize BOOTContext

[21:01] <TimToady> instead it's treated more en-passant-ly as $?LINE is

[21:02] <travis-ci> Rakudo build failed. Zoffix Znet '2017.02 is now in the past'

[21:04] <TimToady> hmm

[21:04] <jnthn> Seems there's a bebug leftover there too

[21:04] <jnthn> *debug

[21:04] <jnthn> But it gets the right languages in the EVAL

[21:05] <jnthn> So I guess the %?LANG got replaced with something appropriate to mkae that happen

[21:05] <jnthn> *make

[21:06] <TimToady> I think it's still limping along with $?LANG for that

[21:07] <jnthn> %?LANG it seems

[21:07] <TimToady> probably needs some further tweaking when we get rid of %*LANG

[21:07] <jnthn> I thought that's what you'd meant we didn't poke into the scope any more, though

[21:08] <TimToady> %?LANG, I mean, is still there for the moment

[21:08] <TimToady> $?LANG doesn't go into the scope

[21:08] <TimToady> and EVAL is still using %?LANG; I misspoke when I said $?LANG

[21:09] <TimToady> that needs fixing up, eventually

[21:09] <jnthn> *nod*

[21:09] <TimToady> I think I didn't have $*LEAF yet when I last visited that code, which might be what's needed there

[21:11] <TimToady> but I was also considering making EVAL a bit macroier, and take an implicit snapshot of $*LANG at the point of the call

[21:11] <TimToady> just didn't get there yet

[21:12] <TimToady> we have to treat EVAL specially in terms of optimization anyway, so it's not like we don't recognize it at compile time

[21:15] <TimToady> geezer nap &

[21:17] <jnthn> That could also work, yeah.

[21:17] <jnthn> nap well :)
