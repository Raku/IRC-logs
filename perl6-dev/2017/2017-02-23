[05:59] <MasterDuke> how do i find if a QAST::Var has a value (during optimize time, not run time)?

[07:51] <nine> ugexe: that's a staging repo. It's meant for packaging, i.e. the generated files would be copied into another, existing repository. We delete the staging repo's version file so the version file of the target repo does not get overwritten.

[07:52] <nine> ugexe: Also so that not every module package (e.g. rpm) contains the same version file as that would create file conflicts on installation.

[09:09] <lizmat> IOninja: re Seekxxx, lack of imagination I guess

[09:10] <lizmat> I though the names would be better than 0, 1, 2  which they were before that

[12:49] <jnthn> And then one-pass -parsing means we commit to it :)

[12:59] <MasterDuke> if i have a QAST::Var in Optimize.nqp, how can i tell if it has a compile-time value (in my test case i know it does, but .has-compile-time-value is always 0)?

[13:01] <MasterDuke> find_lexical looked promising, but didn't work either

[13:02] <timotimo> i think .has_compiletime_value exists?

[13:02] <timotimo> maybe has_compile_time_value

[13:03] <MasterDuke> yeah, but it's always 0

[13:03] <IOninja> m: dd 1 >>[Z]<< 3

[13:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1811b8: OUTPUT: «((1, 3),).Seq␤»

[13:03] <timotimo> oh

[13:03] <jnthn> MasterDuke: When would this occur?

[13:04] <jnthn> A QAST::Var represents a variable

[13:05] <MasterDuke> jnthn: well, i'm testing with this `my $a = 0; loop (my $abc = 0; $abc <= 10000000; $abc += 5) { }; say $a`. and looking to see if $abc has (had?) a compile time value at the += 5 point

[13:07] <jnthn> Well, has_compile_time_value being 0 there is right, 'cus it doesn't

[13:07] <MasterDuke> heh. and i don't see a had_compile_time_value

[13:08] <jnthn> I don't really understand that notion.

[13:08] <timotimo> since you're already in that place, you could see if you can get the value of infix:<+>() at optimize-time

[13:09] <timotimo> and also, if you can figure out if the variable is native in which case it can't be undefined

[13:09] <MasterDuke> jnthn: this is in regards to $abc += 5 being much slower than $abc = $abc + 5

[13:10] <MasterDuke> they optimize to similar code, but the += has a `if p6definite` added. and `call` vs `callstatic` (but i think i've figured that one out)

[13:10] <timotimo> oh yeah, jnthn, did you see that? 2 seconds to do it with native ints and a = a + 5, but almost 250 seconds to do it with +=

[13:11] <MasterDuke> i was surprised by the time difference between $a+=5 and $a=$a+5, a profile is kind of interesting. += is 25% spesh, 75% jit, 6000262 frames entered (1999795 eliminated by in-lining). = + is 100% jit, 671 frames entered(5999385 eliminated by in-lining)

[13:12] <MasterDuke> for `my $a = 0; loop (my $b = 0; $b <= 10000000; $b+=5) { $a+=$b }; say $a` vs `my $a = 0; loop (my $b = 0; $b <= 10000000; $b=$b+5) { $a=$a+$b }; say $a`

[13:14] <jnthn> I wonder if the itme diff is largely down to call vs callstatic?

[13:14] <jnthn> *time

[13:14] <jnthn> That's the difference between inlining and not

[13:15] <MasterDuke> i think that was most of it

[13:16] <jnthn> But I guess what you're really asking is if there's a way to find out if the variable is always assigned a definite value for its lifetime

[13:16] <jnthn> And that's a data flow analysis question

[13:17] <timotimo> aye, there could be $b = Any inside the loop body

[13:17] <MasterDuke> jnthn: pretty much. looking here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Optimizer.nqp#L1647

[13:17] <jnthn> Right, or it could escape to an rw sub :)

[13:17] <timotimo> yup

[13:17] <jnthn> We can't afford to do that kind of stuff in Perl6::Optimizer, really

[13:18] <jnthn> It's much more in the realm of stuff spesh could do at some point

[13:18] <jnthn> Perl6::Optimizer generally needs to be cheap, though.

[13:18] <timotimo> spesh really needs to be fixed so that it can also run optimize_bb over the bbs it inlines ... :\

[13:20] <jnthn> Once I'm done with race/hyper, and rewriting ThreadPoolScheduler, spesh will probably be my focus again.

[13:20] <jnthn> It'll also probably change quite a lot

[13:20] <MasterDuke> well, what i've done so far is copy these lines https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Optimizer.nqp#L1560-L1563 to right before 1647

[13:21] <MasterDuke> and make those :op('call') depend on the result

[13:21] <MasterDuke> which does turn the 'call' from += in my test into 'callstatic' and passes spectest

[13:22] <jnthn> That sounds reasonable

[13:23] <MasterDuke> k, i'll PR that

[13:33] <MasterDuke> argh, i was wrong. call vs callstatic alone is almost no difference in time

[13:35] <MasterDuke> this has the --target=optimize output of += vs = +, and the diff: https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/e966543ed7d491f8f9fb210324d23c14

[13:37] <MasterDuke> hm, well there is a little savings

[13:46] <timotimo> well, the call is only executed once

[13:47] <timotimo> wait, am i reading that correctly

[13:47] <timotimo> which call is the non-static one before your patch?

[13:47] <MasterDuke> i should be inside the loop, right?

[13:47] <MasterDuke> *it

[13:48] <MasterDuke> the `&infix:<+>`

[13:48] <timotimo> there's two &infix:<+> there

[13:49] <MasterDuke> and after my patch they're all callstatic

[13:50] <MasterDuke> vs all call before

[13:51] <MasterDuke> seems to be ~5% faster

[13:53] <MasterDuke> it's a little faster, but nothing more is inlined

[13:53] <MasterDuke> so still 6000262 frames vs 671

[13:54] <MasterDuke> so += is ~5% faster after my patch, but still way off of = +

[15:06] <IOninja> heh... dumbass...

[15:12] <timotimo> MasterDuke: i wonder if the call to infix + wont get inlined because the return type of the no-arg call is unknown

[15:13] <timotimo> perhaps we can reorder optimizations such zhat the no-arg call can be compile time evaluated

[15:13] <timotimo> and that might cause the outer.+ to become inlined

[15:16] <timotimo> it would be nice to have a more easy to analyze output from spesh to tell us what frames were inlined

[15:17] <timotimo> could probably put that below the output of the callsite info

[15:35] <MasterDuke> timotimo: tried adding self.visit_children after https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Optimizer.nqp#L1646 and after https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Optimizer.nqp#L1663, but didn't do anything

[15:41] <timotimo> crap.

[15:44] <timotimo> i wish it'd be easier to figure out what the optimizer thinks

[15:44] <timotimo> but at the same time not be exposed to the firehose you'd get if it outputted stuff everywhere

[15:45] <MasterDuke> yeah, i've tried adding some debug stuff to the optimizer and it's noisy

[15:48] <timotimo> yeah, very

[15:48] <timotimo> i mean, you can invent an optimization level 5 or something

[15:48] <timotimo> since the setting uses 4, you can get through a compile without it spamming too much

[15:48] <timotimo> but that's not the real worry anyway

[15:50] <MasterDuke> i did something like `if $op[0].name eq '$my-made-up-name' { note('stuff') }`, which sort of works

[15:56] <timotimo> oh

[16:02] <MasterDuke> timotimo: got any other ideas to try out?

[16:03] <timotimo> well, we still could do the thing where we detect that the variable in question is a native

[16:04] <timotimo> but that only helps the int $foo case, not the Int $foo case.

[16:07] <MasterDuke> it does already do things like assign_i in that case, lexcalref instead of lexical, and remove the if p6definite for the += constant

[16:07] <timotimo> oh

[16:07] <timotimo> damn

[16:07] <timotimo> well, lexicalref still allocates an object

[16:08] <timotimo> just to throw it away again at the soonest opportunity

[16:08] <MasterDuke> what should it be instead?

[16:12] <timotimo> do you know what part of the code does that specific thing?

[16:14] <MasterDuke> not sure what you mean?

[16:14] <timotimo> what part decides to use lexicalref

[16:15] <MasterDuke> `QAST::Var(lexical $abc) <wanted> $abc` vs `QAST::Var(lexicalref $abc) <wanted> $abc`

[16:17] <MasterDuke> for `my $a = 0; loop (my int $abc = 0; $abc <= 10000000; $abc += 5) { $a += $abc }; say $a`

[19:07] <IOninja> :D

[19:27] <IOninja> .ask nine should we move away from sha1 for modules; RE: https://shattered.io/ ? Looks like we can even mod our sha1 with the collision detector thing: https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection not sure what the performance impact is tho

[19:27] <yoleaux2> IOninja: I'll pass your message to nine.

[19:34] <perlpilot> even if we don't move away from SHA1 right away, we should at least be aware of making "not hard" if we can  (For git, it's apparently hard)

[19:34] <jnthn> What's the actual risk vector?

[19:34] <lizmat> that someone could make a precomp module that contains different code from what was expected

[19:35] <jnthn> Um, but the SHA-1 is of the source, not the bytecode

[19:35] <jnthn> And we don't recompile the source to verify it

[19:35] <IOninja> That you install a module that replaces another module.

[19:35] <gfldex> we don't use SHA-1 to ensure security

[19:36] <jnthn> Right, but if you can trick somebody into installing your malicious module then you've already got them, no SHA-1 vuln needed.

[19:36] <gfldex> that's a topic for package managers of distros

[19:37] <gfldex> jnthn: see https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html

[19:38] <gfldex> using sha-256 would make hash collisions less likely tho, so it's not a terrible bad move to start with

[19:38] <gfldex> also, havin sha-* in CORE expose to users would be nice

[19:38] <perlpilot> note how many SHA1 computations it took for them to find a collision

[19:39] <jnthn> I'm not disputing that the SHA-1 vuln is real, just noting that it needs considering in context.

[19:39] <IOninja> jnthn: but if we assume you can replace another module with this attack, then the parrallel is inexact. User A can install a malicious module and an app that *does not use it* would execute it

[19:39] <lizmat> agree it's not something we need to fix before the next release  :-)

[19:40] <IOninja> Also, IMO there's a public image here at play: "Perl 6 uses SHA-1. Look, there's this website that says SHA-1 is bad"... This is enough to set a perception in users' minds regardless of how easy or practical that attack is to execute.

[19:41] <MasterDuke> jnthn: is now a good time to bug you about Binder.java?

[19:41] <perlpilot> But!  It could affect https://github.com/perl6/book  ;-)   People could be tricked into reading about some Perl 6 that doesn't exist!

[19:41] <IOninja> hehe

[19:43] <jnthn> fwiw, I was under the impression we were heading towards punycode-ing the distribution longname anyway to fix stuff for folks who are unhappy about not being able to `locate`

[19:43] <IOninja> Ah.

[19:43] <IOninja> I don't follow or know anything about the Comp::Unit::* part of the codebase

[19:44] <jnthn> At which point even if we SHA-1 within a distro, they're still "namespaced" under the distribution name.

[19:44] <jnthn> I try not to these days also

[19:44] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Well, should go for a walk soon, but pointer me at what you'd like me to look at :)

[19:44] <jnthn> *point

[19:45] <jnthn> Well, I don't mind knowing stuff about Comp::Unit::. But there's so many *other* things that I need to worry about, and @other are doing a nice job caring for it, so... :-)

[19:46] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Is it about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1018 ?

[19:46] <MasterDuke> i've updated https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1018. it now builds for the JVM, and ./perl6-j -e 'say "hi"' runs fine, but a `make install` fails and i can't run the spectests. here's a gist of the output i get https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke1​7/2c8fbc294f3c9defcf370de046af1331.

[19:47] <jnthn> And it works fine without your changes?

[19:47] <MasterDuke> yeah

[19:47] <jnthn> I get a 404 on that gist URL?

[19:48] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/2c8fbc294f3c9defcf370de046af1331

[19:48] <jnthn> that worked

[19:48] <jnthn> Even though they look the same to me :)

[19:48] <MasterDuke> weird, there's a %u200B in the first one when i hover over

[19:49] <MasterDuke> between the 1 and the 7

[19:49] <jnthn> odd

[19:49] <MasterDuke> and i just copied it from irclog.perlgeek.de

[19:49] <jnthn> Hm, what's that envvar called where you get the full JVM stacktrace...

[19:50] <jnthn> Ah, right. Can you try it with NQP_VERBOSE_EXCEPTIONS=1

[19:50] <jnthn> That should show us where in the binder (I presume it's in the binder) that it's exploding

[19:50] <jnthn> It spits stuff out for all exceptions, even handled ones, so it'll be a bit noisy

[19:50] <jnthn> But the one we want should be final or near final

[19:51] <MasterDuke> gist updated

[19:53] <jnthn> Indentation confusation :)

[19:54] <jnthn> The error[0] assignment is not covered by the if

[19:54] <jnthn> After thechanges

[19:54] <jnthn> Need braces

[19:54] <jnthn> Totally missed that first time I read the code :)

[19:54] <MasterDuke> argh!!

[19:55] <jnthn> :)

[19:55] <jnthn> walk &

[19:55] <MasterDuke> jnthn++

[20:39] <timotimo> i didn't even know that env var!

[21:08] <IOninja> .ask jnthn Num.Rat coerser takes optional epsilon, Int.Rat and Rat.Rat take an optional arg they ignore, and Complex.Rat and Str.Rat don't take any args. Does it make more sense to make all .Rats take an optional arg and ignore it in cases or just have it for types that can make use of it? I'm leaning towards the latter, and removing dummy params

[21:08] <yoleaux2> IOninja: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[21:09] <IOninja> same applies to .FatRat
