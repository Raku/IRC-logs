[01:06] <samcv> heh the more i flesh out the project schedule the more I remember how many things there are to do, lol

[01:14] <llfourn> nine++ # fixing require RTs

[01:29] <llfourn> nine: hmmm actually it seems those require commits have broken Spit the module I released yesterday.

[01:29] * llfourn investigating

[01:55] <llfourn> m: class Test::Foo { }; { require Test; say Test::Foo }

[01:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2a2e46: OUTPUT: «Could not find symbol '&Foo'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:55] <llfourn> ^ This is the golf of the problem

[03:52] <astj> m: class Test::Foo { };  Test::Bar {}; { require Test::Foo; require Test::Bar; }

[03:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2a2e46: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Lexical 'Test' already declared␤»

[03:52] <astj> m: class Test::Foo { };  Test::Bar {}; { use Test::Foo; use Test::Bar; }

[03:52] <astj> oops

[03:54] <astj> anyway, I found requiring multiple modules with same namespace has broken recently. https://github.com/astj/p6-Require-Bug-Demo

[03:56] <llfourn> astj: if you look at the irc logs you'll find I posted a very similar golf of that problem before you came in :)

[03:57] <astj> llfourn: Oh. is this? https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-03-07#i_14216920

[03:58] <llfourn> astj: yep

[03:58] <llfourn> your one actually shows the problem a bit better though

[03:58] <llfourn> it shows that require is also declaring too many lexical packages

[03:59] <astj> llfourn: thanks. hmm..

[04:00] <llfourn> I *might* have a fix coming up

[04:03] <astj> :+1:

[07:26] <nine> llfourn, astj: ok, looks relatively simple to fix

[07:28] <nine> It's just a matter of looking if any of the $longname.components is already declared in lexical scope and re-using that instead of creating the whole package chain.

[07:28] <llfourn> nine: Yeah, I was thinking you have to .WHO.merge-symbols with the outer declaration with your lexical version

[07:28] <nine> Here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L1935

[07:30] <llfourn> oh but yeah you have to not re-duplicate the package chain thing but you also have to make sure you merge the symbols from the outer

[07:31] <llfourn> m: m: class Test::Foo { }; { require Test; say Test::Foo } #otherwise

[07:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2a2e46: OUTPUT: «Could not find symbol '&Foo'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[07:31] <nine> Yep. A $*W.find_symbol before blindly creating the lexical will help

[07:32] <llfourn> oh if you found one you woulnd't create the lexical?

[07:32] <llfourn> that's probably the smart way

[07:32] <llfourn> I was overthinking it and wanted to have a lexical clone of the outer

[07:34] <llfourn> m: package Foo { }; { my package Foo::Bar { } }; say Foo::Bar

[07:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2a2e46: OUTPUT: «(Bar)␤»

[07:34] <nine> I've been down that line of thought and would like it, but it could get hellishly complicated. Better to do a less elegant fix now.

[07:34] <llfourn> ^ I was trying to fix that at the same time

[07:34] <llfourn> it was getting complicated XD

[07:34] <nine> All of this would be so much simpler if packages were no real hierarchy as they are in Perl 5 :)

[07:35] <llfourn> yeah.

[07:35] <llfourn> But .WHO is cool and "torture the implementor on behalf of the user" :D

[07:36] <nine> Btw. copying symbols from an outer package won't be enough, since they can change anytime. You'd have to link those PseudoStashes

[07:36] <llfourn> But if you got a copy at the time you declare it wouldn't that DWIM?

[07:37] <llfourn> I mean symbols could be added to the outer declaration's .WHO later but I thought it would be acceptable not to get them

[07:37] <llfourn> hmm...but I'm not sure how that works with stubs :\

[07:37] <llfourn> you *would* want the stubs to be updated in any case

[07:38] <nine> If you talk in terms of acceptable, leaking those nested packages out of the lexical scope probably is acceptable, too ;)

[07:38] <llfourn> s/acceptable/expected/ :)

[07:52] <nine> This kind of lexical leaking is probably not much of an issue in real code, because it stops at the compilation unit. And you'll rarely try to load conflicting symbols in the same unit. The much more probable case is one of your dependencies trying to use a different version of a module than you.

[07:56] <llfourn> m: { my package Cool::Utils { } }; say Cool::Utils

[07:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2a2e46: OUTPUT: «(Utils)␤»

[07:56] <llfourn> nine: isn't that leaking past the unit?

[07:57] <llfourn> nine: btw I have written tests for the issues above. Will push them when we have a fix :)

[07:57] <nine> It's not leaking past the unit, but it does look a bit broken nevertheless :)

[07:58] <llfourn> hmm but isn't Cool in the SETTING scope ie above the unit?

[07:59] <nine> What I mean is, that if you have the above lexical package in a module, the user of your module won't see Cool::Utils

[08:00] <llfourn> That's what I thought you meant. But thinking about it what you say makes sense as long as the module is precompiled.

[08:01] <nine> True. A "no precompilation;" might change things a bit

[08:01] <llfourn> ok good I'm on the right track :)

[14:36] <IOninja> .ask MasterDuke any ideas on why this fails to match now? https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2017-03-07#i_14219666  Bisectable points to a version bump that brought this commit: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/ab426c147702000cb857cf553c0c062ab7623d9e

[14:36] <yoleaux2> IOninja: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[14:37] <IOninja> And once that fixed, harness6 should stop failing with tests out of sequence.

[15:20] <nwc10> I nearly typoed that as 7

[15:20] <IOninja> Didn't fix anything...

[15:20] <nwc10> that would have got me some serious stares

[15:20] <nwc10> oops, I thought that you did

[15:20] <IOninja> Oh the require thing...

[15:20] <nwc10> yes, that :-)

[15:20] <IOninja> There's still a bug with TAP parser and fancy unicode cahrs.

[15:21] <llfourn> nine: I think I've got a patch for the require issues. Just running spectest :)

[15:21] <nwc10> is that why it thinks that test results are arriving out of order?

[15:21] <nwc10> (I wasn't too worried (yet) about it not being the same as harness5. I was trying to provke MoarVM threading bugs by running it, not actually spectesting Rakudo)

[15:22] <IOninja> Yes.

[15:49] <llfourn> .tell nine I tried. But wasn't able to totally fix require. My WIP: https://github.com/LLFourn/rakudo/commit/62834afaca690c480780d99fc6b51a240b0e1b52. It passes more tests than nom, but doesn't all of the ones I just added to roast :(.

[15:49] <yoleaux2> llfourn: I'll pass your message to nine.

[15:52] <IOninja> m: grammar A { token TOP (:$n) { <foo($n)> .* };  token foo ($n) { . ** {$n} } };  say A.parse("Hello world", args => \(:42n) )

[15:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[15:52] <IOninja> m: grammar A { token TOP (:$n) { <foo($n)> .* };  token foo ($n) { . ** {$n} } };  say A.parse("Hello world", args => \(:5n) )

[15:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «｢Hello world｣␤ foo => ｢Hello｣␤»

[15:52] <IOninja> Don't get why that works, considering:

[15:52] <IOninja> m: my $args = \(:2n); dd [ |$args.Capture ]

[15:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «[]␤»

[15:53] <IOninja> m: my $args = \(:2n); sub x { dd [ @_, %_ ] }( |$args.Capture )

[15:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «[[], {:n(2)}]␤»

[15:53] <jnthn> Because | in [...] is not the same thing as | in an argument list

[15:53] <IOninja> Oh

[15:53] <jnthn> So you're really doing dd [ $args.Capture.Slip ]

[15:53] <IOninja> And what does it end up as in argument list?

[15:54] <jnthn> I expect .Slip would call .list to get a list to make a Slip from

[15:54] <jnthn> So it gets the list part of the capture

[15:54] <jnthn> but \(:2n) has an empty list part - it has no positional args

[15:54] <jnthn> m: my $args = \(:2n); dd $args.list

[15:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[15:54] <jnthn> m: my $args = \(:2n); dd $args.hash

[15:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «Map.new((:n(2)))␤»

[15:56] <IOninja> OK, makes sense now

[16:04] <llfourn> m: { require Test; note Test::.keys }

[16:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[16:04] <llfourn> m: use Test; note Test::.keys

[16:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2db7b: OUTPUT: «(&todo_output EXPORT &failure_output &output)␤»

[16:05] <llfourn> it's more broken than I originally understood :o
