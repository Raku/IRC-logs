[10:36] <samcv> how do i stop this error payload: don't change grammar in the setting, please!

[10:36] <samcv> if trying to add an op

[10:37] <lizmat> well, that seems to be 6.d then ?

[10:37] <lizmat> *6.d material

[10:38] <lizmat> jnthn: is the "Introducing spesh" part in https://6guts.wordpress.com/2014/04/12/optimization-concurrency-and-moar/ still correct ?

[10:39] <lizmat> samcv: what are you trying to do ?

[10:39] <lizmat> having been in that situation in the past  :-)

[10:39] <samcv> https://gist.github.com/samcv/d633ebd66fb5eeda88c71e2492d7217b to Str.pm

[10:41] <lizmat> ok

[10:41] <lizmat> you need to add it to the Grammar.nqp

[10:42] <lizmat> although this *could* be 6.d material: adding methods to classes ok, adding ops wasn't if I recall correctly

[10:43] <samcv> lizmat, which one?

[10:43] <lizmat> src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp

[10:43] <jnthn> lizmat: Yes, if incomplete

[10:43] <jnthn> lizmat: It's out of date in that we now *can* also product machine code at the end

[10:44] <jnthn> *produce

[10:44] <lizmat> ok  :-)

[10:44] <jnthn> lizmat: And since then, importantly, it supports inlining and OSR

[10:44] <samcv> lizmat, thanks :)

[10:45] <samcv> <sym> >> <O(|%structural)> # not sure what this means but just gonna steal the one for cmp and leg

[10:45] <jnthn> lizmat: Can also resolving multi-dispatches at spesh time too

[10:45] <jnthn> *resolve

[10:45] <jnthn> Guess you can just put "And many other little opts" :)

[10:46] <lizmat> jnthn

[10:46] <lizmat> samcv: that's a start

[10:46] <lizmat> you would also need to add it to src/core/precedence.pm I think

[10:46] <samcv> well good sign, it compiled

[10:47] <jnthn> <sym> means "match whatever is in :sym<here>", >> means word boundary, <O(...)> specifies precedence, associativity, etc.

[10:48] <lizmat> jnthn: are you ok with adding this to 6.c instead of 6.d.PREVIEW ?

[10:50] <jnthn> Well, according to the doc I did, it'd go in 6.d

[10:50] <jnthn> How strictly we want to follow that at the moment is another matter.

[10:51] <jnthn> `await` clearly needed to be because it's a notable behavior changes

[10:51] <samcv> what are you guys discussing?

[10:52] <samcv> there's so many changes, hard to keep up :P

[10:54] <lizmat> jnthn: I'm having trouble finding the doc you did about this

[10:54] <jnthn> samcv: Whether or not unicmp belongs in 6.d.PREVIEW or not :)

[10:54] <samcv> ah ok

[10:55] <jnthn> lizmat: It got put into the Rakudo repo so we wouldn't have that problem, I tought? :P

[10:55] <samcv> i'm not even sure what the final name for it is gonna be tho

[10:55] <jnthn> *thought

[10:55] <jnthn> samcv: That'd be even more reason to put it behing 6.d.PREVIEW :)

[10:55] <jnthn> *behind

[10:55] <jnthn> But for now, I guess, make it work at all :)

[10:59] <samcv> though i mean a new op won't be noticed by anybody so idk if we need to hide it

[10:59] <samcv> since it's not gonna be in the docs just yet

[11:00] * samcv wonders if we could hide sorting strings with cmp to use unicmp_s in the preview

[11:00] <jnthn> Yeah, I was wondering about that

[11:00] <jnthn> I think it might be doable

[11:00] <jnthn> Or if not, we can fix it to be doable :)

[11:01] <samcv> heh

[11:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: samcv++ created pull request #1009: Add unicmp op which uses unicmp_s nqp op to do string compare

[11:07] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1009

[11:09] <samcv> jnthn, lizmat thoughts on this pr

[11:10] <lizmat> samcv: what does the 7,0,0 signify ?

[11:10] <samcv> 7 means do primary secondary and tertiary collation

[11:11] <lizmat> I wonder whether that should maybe be settable with a dynamic var?

[11:11] <samcv> lizmat, full info here https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/875867d1

[11:12] * samcv actually might change that 7, but atm the 7 doesn't actually change anything about what MVM does

[11:13] <lizmat> something like $*TOLERANCE

[11:13] <samcv> but i may change it to be 15, meaning primary, secondary tertiary, and 4th level is breaking ties by cp

[11:13] <lizmat> perhaps $*COLLATION ?

[11:13] <samcv> well

[11:13] <samcv> read the whole thing, there's also countrys and languages

[11:13] <samcv> let me know when you've read that mvm commit

[11:16] <lizmat> read it  :-)

[11:16] <samcv> kk

[11:17] <samcv> so yeah maybe $*COLLATION

[11:18] <samcv> but yeah about 95% sure that 7 is gonna be changed to a 15. because i think it might be useful to be able to call cmp and get "same" if the collation values was equal

[11:18] <lizmat> could be a Collation object, with settings for primary/ secondary / ternary

[11:18] <lizmat> and that would then map to 15,0,0 or so  for now

[11:18] <samcv> yeah

[11:18] <samcv> that sounds fine

[11:19] <lizmat> jnthn: is that an idea?  so we can encapsulate that functionality in a simple unicmp operator, yet are able to change its meaning dynamically ?

[11:19] <samcv> and if we have cmp do unicmp_s i think it should do language inspecific

[11:20] <samcv> though there is something to say for always getting the same sorting order even if unicode changes things, though we have synthetics

[11:20] <jnthn> Not sure about dynamically

[11:20] <samcv> and those can be sorted differently based on what synthetic codepoint they are assigned to

[11:20] <jnthn> Could certainly do adverbs, and a pragma

[11:20] <lizmat> jnthn: I was thinking one liners and env variables   :-)

[11:21] <jnthn> Please not env vars. :P

[11:21] <jnthn> And one-liners could easily do it with the adverbs

[11:21] <lizmat> ok

[11:21] <lizmat> clearly I've not gotten rid of the cold yet  :-)

[11:22] <samcv> haha.

[11:22] <samcv> not good when the same program runs differently on different computers

[11:22] * lizmat goes to clock another few hours in bed

[11:22] <samcv> o/

[11:22] <jnthn> lizmat: Feel better! o/

[11:41] <samcv> wow suprised it made it 3x faster

[11:41] <samcv> i already optimzed a ton of this part of the script but

[11:42] <samcv> https://gist.github.com/3bf513759424aae24ae32fa616c278ff top took 1.5s, bottom took .5s

[11:42] <samcv> which was already at least 3x faster than doing @dec.».parse-base(16), by using the nqp ops

[11:46] <samcv> i have the sub that processes UnicodeData.txt now 2x faster than it was yesterday :)

[11:46] <brokenchicken> \o/

[11:46] <samcv> it still takes hours? idk some really long amount of time to do all cp

[11:46] <samcv> i have not waited for it to finish

[11:47] <samcv> well it's still going on the bisectable server, been at least a couple hours

[11:51] <brokenchicken> The <sym> >> <O(|%structural)> stuff: <sym> is the same string as the :sym<....> on that particular proto regex. The `>>` is the right word boundary, and <O...> stuff is the precedence thingie being set up these settings https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp#L3828 this stuff is briefly mentioned in Day 1 of Rakudo Internals course

[11:52] <samcv> ah ok i will look at that more then, thanks :)

[12:04] <samcv> is there a nqp noop?

[12:06] <arnsholt> Why do you need a noop?

[12:07] <arnsholt> If you're building a QAST tree, a Stmts with no children is fine

[12:08] <samcv> just to put in placeholders things that want something there.

[12:08] <samcv> m: use nqp; nqp::if(iseq_i(0,0), )

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 951a44: OUTPUT«5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    iseq_i used at line 1␤␤»

[12:09] <samcv> anyway not super important but was curious if we had a noop

[12:09] <arnsholt> Doesn't look like it

[12:09] <arnsholt> There's a debugnoop listed in the docs, but looks like it's only on JVM

[12:10] <arnsholt> But what kind of thing do you have that requires an op?

[12:10] <samcv> it's not really important, i just wondered it, while i was trying to benchmark if statements compared to code without if statements

[12:10] <samcv> and wanted to just put noop in there so it would compile

[12:11] <samcv> string ne ''; is basically equivalent to nqp::isne_i( nqp::chars($stc), 0); ? at least that's what i'm doing to try and optimize this code

[12:11] <samcv> unless there's a better way to do it

[12:13] <arnsholt> Oh, something to pass nqp::if? Did you try just passing in an empty block?

[12:13] <samcv> yea

[12:15] <arnsholt> Then I'm all out of ideas. But if it's any consolation, nqp::if(..., nqp::noop()) wouldn't work either =)

[12:16] <arnsholt> But from --target=ast it looks like if $cond { $consequent } compiles more or less directly to nqp::if anyways

[12:17] <samcv> kk

[12:18] <samcv> yeah i haven't gotten much speedup changing to nqp::if unless all the surrounding code is already nqp

[12:18] <samcv> then i get a speedup

[12:39] <jnthn> --target=ast doesn't show that the optimizer (output of --target=optimize to see) often optimizes away QAST::Block too

[12:46] <samcv> i wish i could have macros that would go to nqp ops that wouldn't slow anything down

[12:47] <samcv> macros seem slower than subs i guess. hmm. maybe i'll just make subs

[12:48] <samcv> it seems making this thing i'm doing a sub is about the same speed

[12:58] <timotimo> make: *** [gen/moar/stage1/nqpmo.moarvm] Illegal instruction (core dumped)

[12:58] <timotimo> that's fun!

[13:03] <samcv> jnthn, is there a way to make for sure something gets inlined?

[13:03] <samcv> is raw and is pure, what effect do those have on that?

[13:03] <timotimo> is raw is for what happens to the return value, is pure is for whether it'll be considered for compile-time evaluation

[13:04] <jnthn> is pure means it can be constant folded

[13:05] <jnthn> Most inlining happens in the VM, and it decides based on code size, heat, and whether there's things in the sub that make it impossible to inline

[13:09] <MasterDuke_> samcv: re that snippet you posted, `%decomp_spec{$cp}<mapping> = @dec.map( { nqp::atpos(nqp::radix(16, $_, 0, 0), 0) } )` was about twice as fast in my rough test

[13:10] <samcv> faster than the faster test?

[13:13] <MasterDuke_> yeah. .25s intead of .5s

[13:13] <samcv> nice

[13:13] <MasterDuke_> oh, could also try `%decomp_spec{$cp}<mapping> = @dec.map(-> int $_ { nqp::atpos(nqp::radix(16, $_, 0, 0), 0) } )`, might be faster still

[13:17] <dogbert17_> jnthn: fun fact, the original reporter of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/234 saw your changes from yesterday and closed the issue

[13:17] <timotimo> very nice

[13:18] <dogbert17_> timotimo: how's your stomach?

[13:18] <timotimo> it's recovered completely, thank god!

[13:18] <dogbert17_> horay

[13:20] <jnthn> \o/ on both :)

[13:20] <samcv> MasterDuke_, it's actually about exactly the same as what i ended up doing

[13:20] <MasterDuke_> the code or the speed?

[13:21] <timotimo> so ... how do i get a working moarvm again? o_O

[13:21] <MasterDuke_> good either way i guess

[13:21] <samcv> the speed

[13:21] <samcv> though i might do what you said just to make it more readable

[13:21] <samcv> compared to yours https://gist.github.com/samcv/566950400b063ba3a1e680a888a1c339#file-decmp-p6-L53

[13:24] <samcv> does eqat allow arrays?

[13:25] <MasterDuke_> samcv: doh, nm, read your code wrong

[13:25] <timotimo> no, it's only for strings

[13:28] <samcv> actually yours is like 10% faster than mine. gonna go with yours

[13:29] <jnthn> timotimo: No, it's just ill...

[13:29] <timotimo> i'll give it a reboot and see if that changes things to the better

[13:29] <timotimo> if not .. well, at least i still have my laptop to switch to

[13:32] <timotimo> and rebooting is quite fast

[13:33] <timotimo> well, that still asplodes ...

[13:33] <samcv> MasterDuke_, also gonna use map in a different place and prolly speed things up

[14:23] <brokenchicken> nope

[14:24] <timotimo> it can mean you broke the parser :)

[14:24] <brokenchicken> heh

[14:25] <jnthn> May mean a mis-nested other brace too

[14:25] <timotimo> seriously, though. many changes i've tried in moar in the past have caused the most random errors from parsing code

[14:26] <arnsholt> Yeah, that sounds like NQP code. And the error reporting in NQP is in the tradition of most other compilers =)

[14:26] <arnsholt> (That is, not terribly helpful in most cases)

[15:36] <perlpilot> brokenchicken: see?  I told you, you'd do better  :)

[15:37] <brokenchicken> :)

[16:03] <brokenchicken> hm...

[16:03] <brokenchicken> m: 'foo'.match: :g, /o/; say $/

[16:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 97359a: OUTPUT«(｢o｣ ｢o｣)␤»

[16:03] <brokenchicken> m: 'foo'.subst: :g, /o/, 'x'; say $/

[16:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 97359a: OUTPUT«(｢o｣ ｢o｣)␤»

[16:04] <brokenchicken> Seems .subst/.subst-mutate don't set $/ to all the matches when :g is used

[16:05] <brokenchicken> and that was so since before 2015.12

[16:11] <brokenchicken> :(

[16:48] <brokenchicken> hm, no idea how to fix it.

[16:48] <brokenchicken> Don't get why its broken either. It seems to just call .match under the hood, fowarding the $/ up the food chain

[17:44] <jdv79> this is as good as i can golf this bug so far:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d6011770f200f34bfd5beac70ac4465a

[17:44] <jdv79> can anybody repro that or better yet have any ideas?

[17:46] <brokenchicken> That has a feel of a concurrency bug.

[17:47] <jdv79> i know.  oddly if you only have one class i can repro it.

[17:47] <brokenchicken> reproed on 4th run on 2017.01-121-gf94cb21

[17:48] <jdv79> also even the for loop has to have a pair or whatever that is in there - 1..1 kills the repro.

[17:48] <jdv79> so weird

[17:49] <jdv79> i guess that's golfed enough to report

[17:49] <brokenchicken> mhm, stick [CONC] at the start of the subject line

[17:49] <jdv79> oops.  i meant can't repro with jut one class

[17:49] <jdv79> that's our best guess?

[17:49] <jdv79> sure

[17:49] <timotimo> the message seems very much like a concurrency bug, yeah

[17:50] <jdv79> thanks

[18:02] <timotimo> how long do i have to run it every time to get it to explode in valgrind before i decide "it's run long enough, this time it's probably fine"

[18:03] <jdv79> for me it usually kicks in a few seconds or i just restart and it'll hit in a handful

[18:03] <jdv79> sometimes it never hits

[18:04] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130690

[18:04] <timotimo> so do i run it for 5 minutes? 10 minutes? 1 hour?

[18:04] <jdv79> ew

[18:05] <jdv79> i run it for no more than 30s and then just ctrl-c and do it again if it hasn't hit

[18:05] <jdv79> most of the time

[18:05] <jdv79> you can repro it without valgrind?

[18:05] <timotimo> yeah

[18:06] <timotimo> i can

[18:06] <jdv79> huh

[18:09] <timotimo> valgrind also serializes threads, so ...

[18:11] <timotimo> ==24651== More than 1000 different errors detected.  I'm not reporting any more.

[18:11] <timotimo> ==24651== Final error counts will be inaccurate.  Go fix your program!

[18:11] <timotimo> helgrind be like -^

[18:13] <jdv79> haha

[18:13] <timotimo> i'm having a hard time interpreting the firehose that is helgrind

[18:14] <timotimo> disabling spesh seems to make it harder to repro, can you confirm?

[18:17] <timotimo> i've tried like 20 times and didn't get it to crash once

[18:18] <timotimo> SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE doesn't seem to prevent repro, on the other hand

[18:19] <timotimo> SPESH_OSR_DISABLE also doesn't prevent the crash

[18:20] <timotimo> JIT_DISABLE also doesn't prevent it

[18:21] <timotimo> but i still can't repro when MVM_SPESH_DISABLE is set

[20:44] <RabidGravy> Hmm not it seems

[20:45] <timotimo> i think the recent await changes also made backtraces for threads better?
