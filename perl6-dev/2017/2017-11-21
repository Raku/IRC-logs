[16:45] <El_Che> \o/ let's kick travis to see if it build ok on platforms I support

[16:49] <El_Che> https://travis-ci.org/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/builds/305370024

[16:49] <El_Che> running

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> I've wikified the changelog for MoarVM also. Hoping that this will help with some things (e.g. people correcting spelling mistakes instead of just pointing at them, no more unintentional markdown formatting, etc.)

[16:51] <El_Che> thx AlexDaniel, looking fwd to the new release

[16:51] <El_Che> ah the tars have not been pushed yet

[16:52] <El_Che> I was a little too enthousiastic :)

[16:55] <AlexDaniel> hmm… what?

[16:55] <AlexDaniel> I'm pretty sure they were

[16:56] <El_Che> https://moarvm.org/releases/MoarVM-2017.11.tar.gz

[16:56] <El_Che> that's where my build process dies

[16:56] <El_Che> not there

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> ouch

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> samcv: ↑ ?

[16:56] <El_Che> (or the naming changed)

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> I remember there was a delay for moarvm tars

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> but moarvm release was many hours ago so hmm

[16:56] <El_Che> checke, not there even with alternative spellings :)

[16:57] <jnthn> There was no commit here: https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/commits/master

[16:57] <jnthn> Maybe that step was somehow forgotten, or a forgotten push, or some such?

[17:48] <[Coke]> t/spec/S17-supply/watch-path.t fails on OSX here; known?

[17:49] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/65d995a1ad321b97213726ed1bde8c52

[18:03] <ugexe> yeah

[18:03] <ugexe> its the only one that should fail on osx

[18:03] <ugexe> well, not should, but can be ignored

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> I think most tests that are failing on os x are actually fudged

[18:17] <ugexe> can the fudger be done in code instead now, instead of preprocessing?

[18:17] <El_Che> if it's a know failure, wouldn't it make sense to skip it there (torture the implemeters thing)?

[18:17] <El_Che> (not now, but in the future)

[18:17] <[Coke]> fudge, no, manually todo, sure. There are some that are todo'd for os x, IIRC

[18:19] <ugexe> [Coke]: why cant the fudge step happen at runtime? i thought it just inserts todos /skips

[18:20] <[Coke]> it's rewriting the source code. you could do a normal todo, but that ain't fudging.

[18:20] <[Coke]> so, yes, it can be done. Just not with the fudger as is.

[18:20] <[Coke]> I don't actually see an os x skips right now.

[18:21] <samcv> AlexDaniel: where do you need me to put the tar file

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> samcv: just like it was done for 2017.10 here: https://github.com/MoarVM/moarvm.org/commits/master

[18:21] <samcv> ok

[18:21] <ugexe> ah right. i imagined the fudger itself just adding the codegen for selecting OS, you'd run it once, and then keep the modified files as the final source

[18:22] <samcv> ok doing it right now

[18:23] <samcv> done

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> samcv: thank you!

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: OK, try again? :)

[18:24] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: running, same build: https://travis-ci.org/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/builds/305370024

[18:28] <Zoffix> How come you can `but` a type object but not `does` a type object?

[18:35] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: first build just finished (apine in 9m18s). It does 5 builds at the time :)

[18:35] <AlexDaniel> :)

[18:36] <El_Che> by the time I wrote that, 4 other finished

[18:36] <El_Che> :)

[18:36] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: so this is final? If all the build pass, can tag my repo so the pkgs are uploaded to github?

[18:37] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: well, it's already tagged and pushed, so there's no coming back really

[18:37] <El_Che> great

[18:37] <AlexDaniel> unless we want to make a point release, and that'd need some good reason…

[18:38] <El_Che> let's hope not :)

[19:00] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I see no point really

[19:01] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: what'd be useful is to know which test fails exactly

[19:10] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it builds now

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> huh? Was it a flap then?

[19:10] <El_Che> seems an intermittent bug

[19:11] * AlexDaniel wheeeeeeewwww…

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> let's see if I can make it fail here then

[19:19] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: ok, what about: while perl6 t/04-nativecall/12-sizeof.t; do :; done

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> Got a segfault here

[19:28] <dogbert17> oops, will check :)

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> so nvm everyone

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> well, you can check :)

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> but it's not specific to the architecture it seems

[19:30] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: you'll have to run it in a loop to reproduce

[19:30] <AlexDaniel> or maybe you just need ASAN

[19:30] <dogbert17> I am, no failures yet

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: yeah, took about 10 minutes here

[19:38] <dogbert17> are you golfing something here

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> not yet

[19:58] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I hold the packages for now?

[19:58] <El_Che> I can replay the travis builds as many times as you want

[20:01] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: no, we have a bunch of flappers, that's “OK”

[20:02] <AlexDaniel> “ok” as in SNAFU :)

[20:05] <El_Che> ok as "pkgs are releasable if they pass the tests" or ok as "don't release, don't replay travis, we know we have a bunch of flappers"

[20:05] <El_Che> ?

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> stuff is releasable if tests pass at least sometimes :)

[20:06] <El_Che> ok, will release then :)

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> fwiw releasable6 itself has to run the stresstest several times before it actually passes properly
