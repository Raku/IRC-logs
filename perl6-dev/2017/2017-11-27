[00:09] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[00:09] <AlexDaniel> gah… it's really time to automate it

[00:10] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: You produced that by hand? :)

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> no, but I have to start the script and copy-paste to github

[00:10] <jnthn> Ah, phew :)

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> but I produced the script by hand, yes :D

[00:11] <jnthn> I'm...not entirely I look forward to the day when we don't need programmers to write scripts by hand any more...

[00:11] <jnthn> *entirely sure

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: looking at all the conflicts we have periodically, I think all of us will be happier when that day comes

[00:13] <AlexDaniel> ZofBot: go! Conquer the world!

[00:13] <ZofBot> AlexDaniel, Maybe literals are a special case in signature comparison?

[00:29] <jnthn> Nah, for every conflicty encounter I have here, there's a bunch of pleasant, interesting, and useful ones. If it weren't that way, I'd not still be here. :)

[00:29] <jnthn> 'night o/

[00:36] <timotimo> hm. what makes Perl6::Grammar have an NQPArray attached to it that has 1.4k BOOTStaticFrame inside it?

[01:42] <AlexDaniel> bisectable, where have you been all that time?

[01:42] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=78caeb6) the exit code is 1 and the output is identical as well
