[01:26] <llfourn> nine: I left you a message wrt to RT#130535 but it looks like the bot didn't want to pass it on :(

[02:04] <ugexe> s/C::B/D::B/ also allows it to work

[02:04] <ugexe> there are some RTs linked to that^

[02:11] <MasterDuke> don't mean to spam, but hopefully a fresh set of eyes will see this. in src/Perl6/Actions.nqp, how can i find out whether i'm running on a 32 or 64 bit system?

[02:14] <ugexe> m: { class A::B::A { }; }; role A::B::C { }; class A::B { has A::B::C $!x; }

[02:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 80e0bc: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5===␤Type 'A::B::C' is not declared␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3le A::B::C { }; class A::B { has A::B::C7⏏5 $!x; }␤Malformed has␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3ole A::B::C { }; class A::B { has A::B::7⏏5C $!x; }␤␤»

[02:15] <ugexe> remove extra { } around class A::B::A { };, it runs

[02:16] <MasterDuke> .tell jnthn i've updated https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1018. it now builds for the JVM, and ./perl6-j -e 'say "hi"' runs fine, but a `make install` fails and i can't run the spectests. here's a gist of the output i get https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/2c8fbc294f3c9defcf370de046af1331. tied adding some debug statements, nothing jumping out at me. any suggestions?

[02:16] <yoleaux2> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[10:33] <llfourn> ugexe: Yes it's a case where changing the names around fixes it. It happens because when the symbols are runtime merged from the require'd compunit they don't find there way into the lexical version of the prexisting package's .WHO. So if you change the name so the package doesn't exist before it won't happen.

[19:43] <TimToady> Hey, you guyses didn't have to stop developing just cuz I went on vacation!

[19:43] <IOninja> :)

[21:14] <gfldex> we could do with some help to answer the following question: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1208#issuecomment-281482451

[21:33] <b2gills> Perl 5

[21:34] <b2gills> Perl 5's &system was split into one that always involves the shell (&shell), and one that always doesn't (&run)

[21:37] <b2gills> in Perl 5 `system ONE-ARG` uses the shell `system TWO ARGS` doesn't ( except on Windows so that `echo` and `dir` work, which is a security vulnerability waiting to happen )

[21:37] <gfldex> that wasn't the question

[21:38] <b2gills> Then it should be an issue on perl6/roast not perl6/doc

[21:42] <[Coke]> b2gills: given that it's a legit documentation question, I don't see the point. we're all one big happy family here.

[21:47] <b2gills> If the problem is that it isn't tested, then it should be tested, because otherwise it is "undefined behavior". If the tests don't match the change I just did, then frankly both the tests and implementation are wrong. (in this case)

[21:48] <b2gills> I'm sure the implementation follows what the docs now say

[21:49] <gfldex> does "sure" mean you did read the code?

[21:49] <b2gills> I'm sure because otherwise I would have written code that suddenly didn't work right

[21:51] <b2gills> ｢shell 'echo $_'｣  VS ｢run <echo $_>｣

[23:27] <IOninja> Isn't the question whether it uses shell on some possible OS and not as general functionality?

[23:28] <lizmat> .
