[10:25] <jnthn> I'm...not sure that's how killer apps have tended to happen :)

[10:26] <Zoffix> :)

[10:26] <Zoffix> Let's invent the next iPhone while we're at it.

[13:04] <lizmat> afk for the rest of the day&

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+install+rakudo

[13:51] <audreyable6> AlexDaniel, https://perl6.party/post/On-Troll-Hugging-Hole-Digging-and-Improving-Open-Source-Communities

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: what are your thoughts on this ‚Üë

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> it can also give https://medium.com/@audrey.tang/lessons-i-ve-learned-32f5d8107e34 or http://pugs.blogs.com/audrey/2009/08/my-hobby-troll-hugging.html (picked randomly)

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> (and currently that's all it does)

[14:00] <moritz> audreyable6, really? I find that a bit creepy, TBH

[14:00] <audreyable6> moritz, I cannot recognize this command. See wiki for some examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Audreyable

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> heh, it may be :) huggable is already taken, any other ideas?

[14:04] <timotimo> "tangible6"

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> pfffft :D :D

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> that's a good one :D

[14:10] <timotimo> i see i haven't lost my magic touch

[14:14] <timotimo> that being said, i find the bot a strange thing to have

[14:15] <AlexDaniel> you think it's better to have a human point out that giving links to lmgtfy is not that ok? :)

[14:16] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I second moritz's comment :)

[14:17] <Zoffix> Don't really get the point of the bot. The lmgtfy linkage is just one of a billion things that could be unwanted. Will there be a police bot watching over all of them?

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> yea

[14:18] <Zoffix> I don't want people beaten over the head with troll hugging stuff. It's not something you can just shove in someone's face and expect people to obey.

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> well, just giving a link isn't so much of policing I think?

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[14:19] <Zoffix> It's a 3,600-word article. It's not something you can just drop in the middle of an ongoing conversation IMO

[14:21] <AlexDaniel> alright then. I'll keep it online for a lil bit in case it gives someone ideas on something useful that can be done, but won't even commit it.

[14:21] <Zoffix> As for bot police... I see some people hate ZofBot and all it does is converse when asked. I imagine a right winge if a bot auto-triggered to reprimand someone.

[14:21] <Zoffix> Sure :)

[14:22] <Zoffix> ZofBot: it's OK... *I* will always love you.

[14:22] <ZofBot> Zoffix, Fate had placed him in a London office, but what he really enjoyed was this unfettered travel

[14:36] <Zoffix> Thought up another snippet that can tell you whether you're using Perl 5 or Perl 6: .1 + .2 == .3 and say "Perl 6" or say "Perl 5"

[14:36] <Zoffix> :)

[14:41] <[Coke]> Has anyone other than me sent out a lmgtfy link in recent memory? You could just ask me not to do it again. (Which someone already asked in general, and I agree). Not sure that I've given any indication that I'll be a serial offender and require a bot to nag me.

[14:43] <Zoffix> :D

[14:44] <Zoffix> Haha, log shows TimToady himself as an offender :D https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/search/?nick=&q=lmgtfy

[14:45] <Zoffix> Looks like we do it about once a year. Hardly an epidemic :P

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> I thought it might me a good start, but whatever :)

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> be

[14:46] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel++ # A for effort.

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> xD

[14:56] <jdv79> i use lmgtfy on ocassion

[15:00] <Zoffix> I bet the recepients were very greatful for your help :)

[15:00] * Zoffix & for rest of the day

[15:01] <jdv79> they probably got what i would have gotten for them plus a hint

[15:03] <jdv79> in the grand scheme is it worth getting worked up over?

[15:05] <jnthn> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=is+it+worth+getting+worked+up+over :P

[15:05] <tangible6> jnthn, http://pugs.blogs.com/audrey/2009/08/my-hobby-troll-hugging.html

[15:07] <Zoffix> jdv79: "If you cut this chain of souls, saying to someone, ‚ÄúYour step to me is the last step‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägo back and read the manual,‚Äù then their journey of joining the open source process is blocked, and they must find a new upstream before they can continue. So please don‚Äôt ever do that. Rather, help a person go down this road together. You can walk this road together much longer and go much farther."

[15:07] <Zoffix> ‚Äî  https://medium.com/@audrey.tang/lessons-i-ve-learned-32f5d8107e34

[15:08] <Zoffix> jdv79: I think "in the grand scheme of things", is it worth you giving such a reply at all, if you can't be bothered to engage with that human at all?

[15:09] <Zoffix> It's not even "You can probably find something useful if you search for FOO" type of an answer. It's "you are too stupid to search for this, so here, I did it for you". In fact, the old version of lgmtfy used to show a message to that effect at the end of the animation

[15:12] <DrForr> Maybe the answer is as simple as changing the macro name? "keyword-to-search" instead of lmgtfy?

[15:14] <DrForr> (and redirecting to a Google page with the keyword ready, or one of our pages that we have control over?)

[15:19] <DrForr> Or, somewhat harder, change channel behavior to say "Oh, in Perl 6 it's called X, try searching for that" instead of typing 'lmgtfy X'

[15:23] <[Coke]> ... Again, lmgtfy is not an endemic problem here.

[15:25] <AlexDaniel> .oO( https://i.redd.it/ez3tte6xnrwz.jpg )

[15:27] <[Coke]> O_o

[16:17] <Zoffix> https://www.mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/11/09/episode-13-interview-with-damian-conway-designer-of-perl-6-programming-language/

[16:25] <stmuk> http://rakudo.org/2017/11/09/announce-rakudo-star-release-2017-10/

[16:29] <Zoffix> \o/ stmuk++

[16:45] <timotimo> maybe next release we'll drop the "non-blocking i/o" part from "not quite finished"? and suggest sync i/o + threads is good enough for file accesses?

[16:47] <stmuk> " non-blocking I/O (now works for sockets and process)" was changed and intended to say that. Are you suggesting just deleting the entire line?

[16:53] <Zoffix> Probably. Are we meant to make any other IO non-blocking?

[17:02] <AlexDaniel> stmuk++

[17:22] <ugexe> [Coke]: imo that was one instance when lmgtfy was entirely appropriate

[17:36] <Zoffix> ZofBot: LMGTFYGate

[17:36] <ZofBot> Zoffix, 'You aren't going on the stage

[17:36] <Zoffix> :(

[17:39] <ilmari> Zoffix: LMGaTeFY

[17:39] <ilmari> ZofBot: LMGaTeFY

[17:39] <ZofBot> ilmari, test 11.841 - 11.852

[17:39] <ilmari> (sorry, mis-tab)

[17:40] <Zoffix> Actually, I have a useful datapoint on this one. Same person; same effective message: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-08-30#i_15090254 here, response: "thank you i completely understand your point. i'm just a little out of my element on this one";  https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-11-06#i_15410780 here, the response is "i can google just fine."

[17:40] <ugexe> to put it into perspective I would not have continued helping that person if someone hadn't "scolded" them first

[17:42] * Zoffix &

[17:54] <jdv79> thank the gofs async bugs are fewer.  my codes work!

[17:55] <jdv79> *gods

[17:55] <jdv79> its quite funner when stuff works:)
