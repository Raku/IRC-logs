[02:39] <SmokeMachine> hi there! Id like to propose a new named parameter on classify and classify-list... my idea is something like this: https://github.com/FCO/rakudo/commit/6b18cd3b92355ce02b888e4c6eec463d16aecef3 what do you guys think?

[13:03] <tbrowder> .tell AlexDaniel ref pod tests and lines with ws at end: only way i know how to guarantee retaining the ws is to generate the test file via the test harness somehow. any other ideas?

[13:03] <yoleaux> tbrowder: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[13:11] <Zoffix> SmokeMachine: -1 from me on classify changes. I don't think there's much demand for that, so I feel we shouldn't add extra maintenance learning burden; especially considering the .classify/.categorize/.classify-list/.categorize-list gang are already fairly arcane

[13:11] <yoleaux> 13:03Z <jnthn> Zoffix: Anonymous methods actually are closures. The thing that makes things "not a closure" is when they are installed somewhere at compile time. A type has a single meta-object with a single method table.

[13:11] <Zoffix> Ah

[13:14] <Zoffix> SmokeMachine: I know it's easy to add new features, but adding them on a whim, the first time you thought about them will just make things grow and grow, until it's a royal mess that provides 50 different ways to do the same thing, with miles of documentation to go along with it. I had first-hand experience with that when writing https://metacpan.org/release/ZOFFIX/App-ZofCMS-1.001007

[13:16] <Zoffix> Maybe give it a go in module, first?

[13:16] <Zoffix> I'm following that path right now. Gonna make Proxee.pm6 that offers a more polished Proxy with a few more features.

[13:17] <jnthn> Is the EE for Enterprise Edition? :)

[13:17] <Zoffix> :)

[13:17] <jnthn> I only glanced SmokeMachine's proposal (didn't have time/brane to ponder it more yet), though I note that the additions lets you do something in O(1) space that'd need O(n) space otherwise

[14:02] <perlawhirl> ooh, we talking 'bout .classify(). I have a request that is much less invasive, I just want to make argless .classify a little more DWIMMY, rather than, you know... die

[14:04] <SmokeMachine> my code doesn't handle junctions yet (https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/fca87f2030d5cab6fc8460e5b195aecd9b7765b2/S32-list/classify.t#L121)... but Im going to solve that today later...

[17:43] <AlexDaniel> wander: hello

[17:43] <AlexDaniel> wander: I don't think it was fixed really. It's just that junctions were changed to DWIM with ~ (lizmat++)

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> m: say <A a>.any ~ <Z z>.any

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a32089fd: OUTPUT: «any(AZ, Az, aZ, az)␤»

[17:45] <wander> see.

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> we can bisect to find when it was done, but iirc it was a lot of work that was first reverted, and then brought back again later when it was more ready

[17:46] <AlexDaniel> and that's kinda irrelevant anyway

[17:46] <wander> m:  sub foo (*@a) { @a.join: '|' }; say foo <h H>.any, 'amadryas'

[17:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a32089fd: OUTPUT: «any(h|amadryas, H|amadryas)␤»

[17:48] <wander> AlexDaniel: is it? ^ looks like any-junction works correct with routine having a slurpy

[17:48] <wander> not only `~` at least

[17:49] <wander> or .join implemented with `~`

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> m: sub foo ($a, $b) { ($a, $b).max }; say foo <h H>.any, ‘amadryas’

[17:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a32089fd: OUTPUT: «any(h, amadryas)␤»

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> m: sub foo (*@a) { @a.max }; say foo <h H>.any, ‘amadryas’

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4a32089fd: OUTPUT: «amadryas␤»

[17:52] <AlexDaniel> dunno, that looks different ?

[17:54] <wander> yes, thank you.

[17:58] <AlexDaniel`> .ask AlexDaniel test

[17:58] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel`: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[22:14] <yoleaux> 28 Nov 2017 23:51Z <SmokeMachine> lizmat: this (WiP) (https://github.com/FCO/rakudo/commit/94617ea607892bf7e29490820bac397015c3b137) is what I mean when I was talking about add a :&reduce parameter to classify-list/classify

[22:14] * lizmat is feeling really under the weather

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: that's ok. In fact, it wasn't advertized as much as other squashathons, so chances are we'll have just AlexDaniel working on RT tickets for 50 hours… :)

[23:16] <jnthn> Not sure if it makes it taste difference, but it looks cool :)

[23:17] <MasterDuke> it is impressive, not the sort of thing one wants to wave around wildly

[23:22] <jnthn> Kwak isn't something to be consumed too wildly either :)

[23:25] <MasterDuke> true. i preceded it with a 6.8% Innis & Gunn (also quite good), so i was perfectly content to stop after those two

[23:26] <jnthn> :)

[23:27] * jnthn is glad to be able to easily obtain the Innis & Gun Rum Finish, which is his favorite of them

[23:27] <jnthn> Hopefully I wake up with sufficient brane tomorrow to sort out the re-working of MoarVM's exception handler inlining

[23:28] <jnthn> If I can, we get to inline a bunch more things

[23:28] <MasterDuke> that's what i had. never heard of it before, but was pretty happy with the bartender's recommendation
