[14:49] <IOninja> FWIW commits like these are a kinda hard to log in ChangeLog: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/05738657f829928a5b1612d37dca17553

[14:50] <IOninja> The problem was caught by a spectest so I'd guess it affects our users.. but what is the problem that was fixed?

[14:52] <moritz> if there's no further description, I generally assume it was introduced just a bit earlier, and doesn't warrant a mention in the changelog

[14:52] <IOninja> OK
