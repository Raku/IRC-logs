[10:54] <nine> .tell geekosaur I've had a quick look at it yesterday and believe it to be a type mismatch in p5_av_top_index. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

[10:54] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to geekosaur.

[11:05] <nine> .tell geekosaur Oooh...no, it's probably not as mundane as that. An issue with JIT compilation of native calls is more consistent with the facts. It's probably not correctly expanding signed return values correctly on some platforms.

[14:29] <lizmat> that could be considered overkill, not sure
