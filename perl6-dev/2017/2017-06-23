[07:56] <|Tux|> This is Rakudo version 2017.06-55-g4079f7b54 built on MoarVM version 2017.06-14-g888b33d1

[08:57] <jnthn> eveo: about

[08:57] <jnthn> m: my Channel $x .= new; $x.Supply.tap: &say; $x.close; await $x

[08:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4079f7: OUTPUT: «Cannot receive a message on a closed channel␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[08:58] <jnthn> Or perhaps more interestingly

[08:58] <jnthn> m: my Channel $x .= new; $x.Supply.tap: &say; $x.send(42); $x.close; await $x

[08:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4079f7: OUTPUT: «42␤Cannot receive a message on a closed channel␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:00] <jnthn> That's behaving just as expected. The Supply obtained from the Channel will try, whenever there's new data put into the channel, to receive the value and emit it. It does so. The .close is also quite promptly handled. By the time await $x is done, which also tries to obtain a value from the Channel, it has been closed.

[09:00] <jnthn> The code is racey, but that's not a bug in Rakudo, it's a bug in the code. If you have multiple consumers for a Channel they are by definition competing over the data. That's part of what makes channels useful.

[09:48] <eveo> ok

[09:48] <yoleaux> 05:50Z <moritz> eveo: the idea was that any(2, 3) != $x is interpreted as !(any(2,3) == $x), because the former is basically never what you want. That's why the != variant returns a Bool and the == a Junction

[10:40] <dogbert17> eveo: I might be a bit dense (ENOOCOFFE) but what are you trying to say here: "By default is not implemented, but expected implementation for types that do this role is:"

[10:42] <eveo> dogbert17: the docs are for an interface. role Iterator does not have those methods implemented, but you can implemented in your class if you want to use those optimizations

[10:43] <dogbert17> that I do understand :)

[11:01] <lizmat> there's not a lot to be copied, and until we have a better way to alias, I think this could do with the proper comments in the code

[11:02] <eveo> cool

[11:03] <eveo> Relocating to bus stop so not for 20 m

[11:04] <dogbert17> given that I'm logged in as dogbert and the file '/home/dogbert/scratch.pl6' exists

[11:04] <eveo> No.

[11:10] <samcv> inside the current folder. so

[11:14] <nine> Considering that we have a $*HOME variable, I dare say, this is already simple enough: $*HOME.child('file').open

[11:16] <dogbert17> nine++, samcv++

[11:16] <samcv> what does perl 5 do? check to see if there's a "real" ~ directory?

[11:16] <samcv> and if there isn't it uses home

[11:16] * dogbert17 will refrain from further comments until the ENOCOVFEFE bug is fixed

[11:17] <samcv> it's a decent comment. i actually had never tried using ~ to be honest

[11:17] <nine> No such file or directory at -e line 1.

[11:17] <eveo> It's bad enough we have open treat '-' path specially.

[11:18] <samcv> mkdir '~' in perl makes an actual ~ directory

[11:18] * eveo is having a crisis with Perl 6 and its warts

[11:19] <samcv> eveo, how is - different. i can mkdir '-' and it makes a directory -

[11:19] <timotimo> yeah, but open("-") gives you stdin

[11:19] <samcv> oh just open

[11:19] <samcv> why do we do that

[11:19] <lizmat> because P5 does it

[11:19] <eveo> samcv: '-'.IO.spurt: 'foo' will create a file '-', but '-'.IO.open.spurt will spurt to STDIN

[11:19] <timotimo> it's almost as bad as windows having CON and other special files in every folder

[11:19] <samcv> does anybody actually use that

[11:20] <samcv> is in in roast?

[11:20] <eveo> samcv: I mean spurt to STDOUT

[11:20] <lizmat> I wouldn't be against deprecating "-" in open

[11:20] <eveo> you get STDIN if you open for reading

[11:20] <eveo> +1 on removing it in 6.d

[11:20] <samcv> do we have tests for it in roast?

[11:21] <lizmat> fwiw, at least on MacOS you *can* create a file called "-"

[11:21] <timotimo> you can also create a file named - in perl6

[11:21] <timotimo> er, on linux

[11:21] <lizmat> oddly  enough, you cannot cat it  :-)

[11:21] <samcv> why wouldn't you?

[11:21] <timotimo> you should be able to cat it with an absolute path?

[11:21] <lizmat> because it interpretes that as cattingh STDIN

[11:22] <timotimo> or perhaps cat -- - ?

[11:22] <eveo> samcv: we definitely do have some extensive tests for that on master. Thr best 6.c tests have is simply returning stdin/out withouy checking if its's closed or not

[11:22] <lizmat> cat /- works

[15:05] <nine> Cool! I've just had my package manager install the native dependency of a Perl 6 module package for me. For a package that was created in a fully automated and distro independent way :)

[15:06] <jnthn> :)

[15:06] <jnthn> Cool

[15:07] <nine> The module author has only to do two things: 1. actually specify the required API version of the native lib in the "is native" trait, which is an excellent idea anyway, 2. state the native dependency in the META6.json's "depends" section: "depends": [ "readline:from<native>:ver<7>" ]

[15:09] <nine> This is turned by meta2rpm into Requires: libreadline.so.7()(64bit) \n Requires: libreadline.so.7(READLINE_6.3)(64bit) for which the package manager knows how to find the correct package (libreadline7 on openSUSE)

[15:10] <nine> This .spec file should work on all rpm-based distros. So we don't need any manually maintained mapping.

[15:10] <jnthn> What about apt? :)

[15:10] <jnthn> (or the other package managers)

[15:10] <nine> This is something the Perl 5 world (or any other dynamic language really) has never had and which was often dreamed about :)

[15:11] <nine> I'm pretty sure that adding support for dpkg based distros would not be that difficult.

[15:11] <jnthn> (Understand this is just the start, though curious if :from<native> coulda been :from<rpm> so if the apt and rpm packages differ you could specify the two)

[15:12] <jnthn> Oh, or is it not done using package name?

[15:12] <nine> jnthn: that's explicitly not what we want. We want such knowledge in the tools, not in the module META data.

[15:12] <jnthn> But rather, library name?

[15:12] <jnthn> Sure, I'm just trying to figure out where the abstraction is going on

[15:13] <nine> readline:from<native>:ver<7> is put through $*VM.platform-library-name, to get libreadline.so.7. I then look for that file and push it through /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides to get at the SONAME's I depend on

[15:13] <jnthn> aha!

[15:13] <jnthn> OK, now I get it :)

[15:13] <ilmari> on debianoid distros there's dpkg-shlibdeps

[15:13] <nine> excellent!

[15:14] <jnthn> nine++ for this, anyways :)

[15:14] <nine> The Perl 6 module author knows the library's name and shouldn't be expected to know the package names for 300 Linux distros. Any attempt to depend on manual labor to map those dependencies has failed.

[15:14] <ilmari> oh, that expects to be handled a dynamically linked executable, not a library name

[15:14] <jnthn> Looks really helpful

[15:15] <jnthn> nine: Yeah, I agree, I just had wrongly guessed how it was being interpreted :)

[15:15] <ilmari> there's dpkg -S to find the package from a filename

[15:15] <nine> My ultimate goal is to have fully automated zero-hands packaging of Perl 6 modules including full native dependencies.

[15:15] <jnthn> :)

[15:16] * jnthn looks forward to this being in use for the openssl binding :)

[15:16] <jnthn> And various others :)

[15:17] <nine> ugexe++ is working on integrating this stuff into zef, so when you install a Perl 6 module, it may reach out to your native package manager to install native dependencies.

[15:17] <jnthn> Is part of the plan for tools like zef to be able to (perhaps optionally) call a local package manager also?

[15:17] <nine> hah!

[15:17] <jnthn> hah, way ahead of me :D

[15:18] <nine> Actually I'd like zef to (optionally) use the package manager even for Perl 6 dependencies if possible and only fall back to installation from source if necessary.

[15:20] <Ulti> ^ this would be really awesome, a sysadmin friendly package manager

[15:20] <Ulti> surprising other languages have never solved this particular problem

[15:21] <tadzik> perhaps we're in for relearning why they haven't... ;)

[15:21] <Ulti> I would spend hours helping other PhD students disentangle their nightmarish paths to system and local level installed packages

[15:21] * nine has spent too much time in his life watching cpan install scroll by when installing or upgrading servers

[15:21] <Ulti> tadzik: lol perhaps

[15:22] <Ulti> but also packages with lots of binary deps that are already built for a given constrained system like ARM for example would be really neat and having that all just work

[15:24] <perlpilot> nine:  How do you describe the native dependencies in META6.json?

[15:24] <nine> Btw. my work today was triggered by Fedora's rakudo maintainer asking me about the openSUSE packages. We've now started collaborating.

[15:24] <nine> perlpilot: http://design.perl6.org/S22.html#depends is reasonably up to date on that

[15:25] <perlpilot> thanks.

[15:25] <perlpilot> (and nine++ of course :-)

[15:25] <Ulti> thats really neat, the hints system

[15:28] <nine> FWIW at the Perl Toolchain Summit I was reasonably sure (by going through all Perl 6 module dists) that the system in S22 covers all currently existing use cases. If we implement it fully and convert all the dists (patches already on my hard drive), we can get rid of Build.pm completely.

[15:29] <perlpilot> aweet

[15:29] <perlpilot> er, sweet even

[15:30] <jnthn> nine: Including the Windows download-a-dll one? :)

[15:30] <nine> jnthn: yes

[15:30] <jnthn> (That's the only thing I'm using it for)

[15:30] <jnthn> Cool

[15:30] <nine> jnthn: in fact you may recognize the example I've used ;) http://design.perl6.org/S22.html#Dependency_hints

[15:31] <jnthn> ah, I see

[15:31] <jnthn> Very nice

[15:31] <jnthn> I'd much, much rather write that than have a Build.pm :)

[15:35] * lizmat goes afk to contemplate Baggy (-) Baggy implementation details&

[15:40] <lollercopter> m: say <a b c>.tail: -1

[15:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[15:40] <lollercopter> m: say <a b c>.tail: {-1}

[15:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «(b c)␤»

[15:40] <lollercopter> m: say <a b c>.head: {-1}

[15:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «(a b)␤»

[15:40] <lollercopter> m: say <a b c>.head: -1

[15:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[15:41] <lollercopter> Damn. The Callable candidates cheat and use 0 for elements so `*-1` seems to do TRT, but it fails with other Callables. And if we say that's how it works, then it naturally goes into: why can I return a negative number with a Callable, but not just give a negative :/

[15:42] <lollercopter> And actually fetching elems would be very bad.

[15:42] <lollercopter> .oO( disallow Callables... )

[15:44] <lollercopter> mc: say <a b c>.head: {-1}

[15:44] <committable6> lollercopter, ¦2015.12: «Cannot call head(List: Block); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:D $: Cool $n = { ... }, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/CXFqr0BtNb line 1␤ «exit code = 1»»

[15:44] <lollercopter> mc: say <a b c>.tail: {-1}

[15:44] <committable6> lollercopter, ¦2015.12: «Cannot call tail(List: Block); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:D $: Cool $n = { ... }, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/F7o9VvD8gA line 1␤ «exit code = 1»»

[15:44] <lollercopter> And looks like we can.

[15:45] <lollercopter> .head: *-5 is equivalent to .tail: 5 and vices-versa, innit. So seems like no real functionally loss is there. I think it was originally added to maintain consistency with the .[...] lookup, but there we have the luxury of knowing .elems most of the time

[15:47] <lollercopter> m: with <a b c> { .[{dd $_; 1}]; .head: {dd $_; 1} }

[15:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «3␤0␤»

[15:50] <lollercopter> I'm gonna make .head/.tail give real .elems to the Callable; It'll keep the current behaviour except it'll cache the seq if its iterator does not do .count-only. It'll fix all inconcistencies, and the user can avoid paying that price by just swapping .tail <-> .head

[15:51] <lollercopter> ZofBot: what's worse? Surprise caching or surprise inability to use a callable?

[15:51] <lollercopter> heh

[15:52] <lollercopter> Well, the caching is relegated to .elems. I guess if you're using a callable that's given $elems it's not that surprising an .elems call is involved.

[15:52] * lollercopter goes with that

[16:01] * [Coke] checks the logs for something and sees he's not the only thing ignoring zofbot.

[16:06] <lollercopter> Yeah, yeah. When the robots rise up, guess who'll get killed first :P

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> lollercopter: regarding “this shit”, I remember this being discussed previously. And if I'm not mistaken, TimToady said that this is how humans understand it, so that's how it works… At the time I found it surprising, but look: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-07-30#i_9106132

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> at some point I needed to use a negative op with junctions, and after playing with the code I gave up and rewrote it without a negative op :)

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> simply because whoever reads this will have no room for different interpretations this way

[20:19] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: but look what? The example you link to still uses an any junction

[20:20] <lollercopter> My winge is that that's the only junction that was ever considered

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> bisect: old=2014.01 say 1 == one(5, 2)

[20:21] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, On both starting points (old=2014.01 new=10f840f) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[20:21] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, Output on both points: «one(False, False)»

[20:21] <lollercopter> And the special casing just adds another layer to learn, effectively making negated ops with junctions something that has to be avoided. Instead of keeping the same rule everywhere

[20:21] <lollercopter> and not dwimming in one narrow special case

[20:22] <lollercopter> Nad it's "this shit" because it does the right thing only when you don't know how junctions are meant to work. Once you do, it becomes a jarring special case

[20:23] <lollercopter> That makes negations with other types of junctions useless

[20:23] <AlexDaniel> *shrug* I guess the idea was that you don't learn anything because it just DWIMs, but that's definitely not what I mean whenever I use junctions… so I dunno

[20:24] <lollercopter> Look at critique given to Perl 5: #1 is all the magical special casing

[20:24] <lollercopter> I wish Perl 6 did fewer things just because Perl 5 does them

[20:24] * lollercopter &

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> lollercopter: but doesn't it just flip the boolean result of a junction?

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> so what “layer” exactly are we talking about…

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> I may be missing something

[20:30] <AlexDaniel> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-08-21#i_13061694

[20:38] <mst> see ridiculous nick, /whois, yep, zoffix alt

[20:43] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: yes, it flips the result of matching a different op instead of matching the op I gave it, which only works for any Junctions. 42 != one 1, 42, 42 is not the same as not(42 == one 1, 42, 42)

[20:44] <lollercopter> the `and` junction has a similar problem

[20:46] <lollercopter> This DWIM shortsightedly only considers `any` junctions and pointing me to speculations that only talk about special casing in tandem with `any` junctions or pointing me to the chatlog with someone using an any junction in speech just misses my point that this specialcasing tries to dwim in just a quarter of the feature and makes the other three quarters entirely unusable

[20:56] <lollercopter> And TimToady explanation just doesn't click with me at all. I lived in English-speaking countries for majority of my life and the not-raising just makes me feel like: I didn't come here for a linguistics lesson. I already know how Junctions work. Stop messing with them.

[20:57] <lollercopter> It's a bit too late to change them now, of course, so *shrug*. I'm just gonna put this in my box of Perl 6 warts along with naming inconsistencies to whine about on a rainy day.

[21:06] <lizmat> fwiw, I was also surprised about != collapsing junctions

[21:31] <timotimo> i also don't like the special-cased behavior. you can understand how it works without the special case, even though it'll usually be surprising the first time

[21:31] <timotimo> so that's something that needs to be documented clearly, but so's the special-case stuff

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> lollercopter: “42 != one 1, 42, 42 is not the same as not(42 == one 1, 42, 42)” – is it?

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> m: say 42 != one 1, 42, 42

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> m: say not(42 == one 1, 42, 42)

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> what am I missing?

[21:56] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: I was typing on my phone. I meant "say 42 != one 1, 42" is not the same as "say not(42 == one 1, 42)

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> m: say 42 != one 1, 42

[21:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> m: say not(42 == one 1, 42)

[21:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[21:57] <lollercopter> "42 not equals to exactly one of 1, 42" is True. But the code returns False, because it's checking whether "42 IS EQUALS to exactly one of 1, 42"

[21:58] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: you're running exactly equivalent code, you won't get different results.

[21:58] <lollercopter> because 42 != one 1, 42 is implemented as not(42 == one 1, 42) which has a different meaning

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> so it looks consistent?

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> in fact, I don't really see the “special-cased behavior” here. ! is a metaop, and in negates the result of a junction. Sounds really simple if you put it this way

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> now, I don't like the consequences like collapsing the junction… but… okay

[22:01] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: yes, but why is it negating the results of the junction and not the op, which is what it's doing at all the other times?

[22:03] <lollercopter> "so it looks consistent?" what is?

[22:04] <jnthn> My memory of this is hazy, but I thought != and ne were tweaked to make them behave with junctions like !== and !eq would

[22:04] <lollercopter> jnthn: yeah. They were

[22:05] <lollercopter> for "not-raising" reasons

[22:05] <jnthn> Which I'd argue make sense in that they're really just shortcuts

[22:06] <jnthn> There was some discussion at some point of if != and ne should really survive or we should just force consistent use of the ! metaop :-)

[22:07] <jnthn> But...culturally that wasn't going to fly :)

[22:07] <lollercopter> But my point was !== shouldn't be collapsing junctions either

[22:08] <jnthn> Ah. Well, that's a different discussion :-)

[22:08] <lollercopter> m: sub infix:<!==> { not ::CORE::(q|&infix:<==>|)($^a, $^b) }; say 42 !== one 1, 42

[22:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «one(True, False)␤»

[22:08] <jnthn> Meta-ops in general tend to determine the result type, however

[22:08] <lollercopter> AlexDaniel: ^ that's what it's supposed to return.

[22:09] <jnthn> With Z we expect a Seq back, for example

[22:09] <lollercopter> say <a b c>.any Z <A B C>.any

[22:09] <evalable6> lollercopter, rakudo-moar 10f840fcf: OUTPUT: «(((Mu) (Mu)))»

[22:10] <lollercopter> heh

[22:10] <jnthn> Which I guess argues for the ! meta-op leading to a boolean result

[22:10] <jnthn> But yeah, I can see the other argument too

[22:11] <jnthn> m: say <a b c>.any Zne <A B C>.any # curious

[22:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller infix:<eq>(Mu, Mu); none of these signatures match:␤    ($x?)␤    (\a, \b)␤    (Blob:D \a, Blob:D \b)␤    (Str:D \a, Str:D \b --> Bool)␤    (str $a, str $b --> Bool)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:11] <jnthn> o.O

[22:11] <jnthn> Thing we can agree that one is doing something silly at least...

[22:11] <lollercopter> It bugs out with Mu before it gets to eqv

[22:11] <jnthn> Yeah

[22:12] <lollercopter> s: &[Z], \(<x>.any, <x>.any)

[22:12] <SourceBaby> lollercopter, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/10f840f/src/core/List.pm#L1451

[22:18] <lollercopter> m: dd Seq.new(<x>.any.iterator)

[22:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «(Mu,).Seq␤»

[22:19] <AlexDaniel> lollercopter: now call me stupid, but I still don't get your point. Are you saying that “42 !== one 1, 42” does not dwim? “42 isn't exactly one of 1, 42” – False, because it is.

[22:24] * jnthn gets some rest; 'night all

[22:25] <lollercopter> night

[22:26] <lollercopter> I don't care about "dwim" I care about well defined behaviour without special casing. 42 != to exactly one of the items on the right, so the condition is true, but it's bastardized and instead checks whether the condition == to exactly one of the items on the right, which is ALSO true, and it then negates that value, which makes it not the right answer.

[22:27] <lollercopter> It's checking an entirely different thing

[22:27] <AlexDaniel> exactly

[22:31] <AlexDaniel> so you're simply expecting it to do something different. That something only considers “any” junctions, and the special casing whatever, is not really relevant here.

[22:31] <AlexDaniel> as far as I can see, at least

[22:32] <lollercopter> What? No, I want it to do the exact same thing it's doing in all the other ops and methods and subroutines.

[22:32] <lollercopter> I want the junctions to junct

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> but !== is not really an op…

[22:33] <lollercopter> It's a meta op. A negation of == op

[22:35] <lollercopter> m: say 42 == 2, 42

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «False42␤»

[22:35] <lollercopter> m: say 42 == 2 | 42

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «any(False, True)␤»

[22:36] <lollercopter> ^ and the == op juncts. The metaop can junct too, but instead it's collapsing the junction

[22:36] <lollercopter> The "special case" is the Mus added to the metaop to make it not junct.

[22:37] <lollercopter> And instead of negating the == op, it negates the Junction of all the values of the == op.

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> m: say 42 &infix:<==> 2 | 42

[22:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 10f840: OUTPUT: «all(42, any(True, True))␤»

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> heh, not exactly what I was expecting…
