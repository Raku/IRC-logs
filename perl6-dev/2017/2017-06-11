[00:12] <eveo> Reporting with plugin: Zef::CPANReporter+{<anon|85479024>}

[00:12] <eveo> Use of uninitialized value of type Zef::CPANReporter in string context.

[00:12] <eveo> Methods .^name, .perl, .gist, or .say can be used to stringify it to something meaningful.

[00:12] <eveo> in method report at /home/cpan/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6/site/sources/643D88410EFE62A5D6F3C68A2811502A3DD01FF4 (Zef::CPANReporter) line 18

[00:12] <eveo> No idea what's causing it now. The email is fine (replicated the code used by the module and it reads the conf file to grab the email just fine)

[00:25] <eveo> Looks like a good chunk of burnt toast is due to a bug in toaster where it says the module is already installed, and the failing version fails because RabidGravy is incorrectly using an END {} block in a bunch of test files

[00:43] <eveo> intersting using $*LANG.define_slang() don't explode, but doing if 0 {} else { $*LANG.define_slang } explodes with "No such method 'sink' for invocant of type 'Perl6::Grammar'. Did you mean 'sign'?"

[00:43] <eveo> I would've thought both versions would function the same

[00:47] <eveo> I think toasting is something to be done a week pre-release rather than daily or whatever... at least for now. Simply because there's no good way to indicate which modules got fixed up and have PRs awaiting and don't need any more checking. You can't really mark them in DB, because what if another failure was introed :/

[00:52] <eveo> And this burn is due to crappy tests. Testing X::NYI exception's exact output https://toast.perl6.party/module?module=Grammar::BNF&commit=2017.05-393-g8b86b50

[00:58] <MasterDuke> i don't actually see a difference between expected and got there. whitespace?

[00:59] <eveo> Old version has rogue space at the end

[01:00] <eveo> m: use Test; ok 1, "foo\nbar\nber"

[01:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b86b5: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - foo␤bar␤ber␤»

[01:01] <eveo> we should probably handle this case; when desc is splitting over multiple lines

[01:02] <MasterDuke> heh, probably not going to happen all that frequently. but yeah, still good to handle it

[01:04] <eveo> It did happen to me just now indirectly. I split a regex for `message` in `throws-like` on multiple lines and `throws-like` used its .gist()

[01:05] <eveo> buggable: author jonathanstowe

[01:05] <buggable> eveo, Found 62 dists for jonathanstowe. See https://temp.perl6.party/buggable/05351160189697341497143148.html

[01:06] <eveo> Wonder if RabidGravy will have a heart attack if I send him 62 PRs fixing broken travis files that still use panda :}

[01:21] <eveo> hm. can't connect to my toaster VM anymore after rebooting it. "ssh: connect to host 104.154.66.115 port 22: Connection refused"

[01:21] <eveo> Wonder if it's a rogue module messing something up

[01:22] <eveo> nm... now it works. Stupid google

[01:30] <ugexe> is there a concise way to write a file lock + code block + unlock similar to Lock.protect({ ... }) ?

[01:31] <eveo> nope

[01:32] <eveo> Man, Temp::Path is now failing its t/03-DESTROY.t tests but only while running zef both with zef --/tap-harness --verbose test . and with tap harness, but I can't gett it to output verbose output to see what the actual failure is

[01:35] * eveo installs a custom zef

[01:35] <ugexe> go one step further

[01:35] <ugexe> --/tap-harness --/prove

[01:36] <ugexe> this will run them with `perl6` command directly

[01:37] <eveo> Well, I popped 'vl' command to Zef::Service::Shell::prove and.... now the tests doesn't fail :(

[01:37] <eveo> ZofBot: quantum fail

[01:37] <ZofBot> eveo, 09 cusr 119

[01:37] <eveo> -vlr arg I mean

[01:38] <eveo> :S

[01:39] <eveo> prove -e 'perl6 -Ilib' -r t/03-DESTROY.t  fails  prove -e 'perl6 -Ilib' -vlr t/03-DESTROY.t  succceeds

[01:39] <ugexe> lol

[01:40] <eveo> "Segmentation fault" ahhhh

[01:47] <eveo> Looks like another face of https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131510#ticket-history bug. Removing `use lib <lib>` inside the test file and using solely -Ilib avoids the issue

[01:47] <MasterDuke> have a stacktrace or valgrind output for it?

[01:47] <MasterDuke> if not, could try mentioning it to dogbert17, he's good at getting that info

[01:54] <ugexe> it might help if you include in that ticket the output with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1

[01:55] <ugexe> that should technically be enough to figure out what is going wrong

[01:56] <ugexe> for the -Ilib / use lib <lib> thing

[02:00] <eveo> Doesn't look like it wants to segfault with it enabled

[02:00] <ugexe> well, i have a good idea what it is then

[02:01] <ugexe> its the `run` that does precomp, and its the bug that has to do with stderr/stdout buffer, which one you read first, and which one you close first

[02:01] <eveo> It segfaults after running some tests tho. Like this is one of the outputs: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131510#txn-1465483

[02:01] <ugexe> the prove thing would be related because -v probably adds a bunch of extra stuff to stderr

[02:02] <eveo> actually, seems to consistently segfault like that, after starting 3rd test grup

[02:03] <ugexe> yea, and does it change if you rm -rf lib/.precomp ?

[02:03] <eveo> It didn't segfault after removing it, but next run segfaulted at the same place

[02:04] <ugexe> yep

[02:04] <ugexe> so there should be a difference in RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG loading

[02:04] <ugexe> specifically the precomp-repo it tries to use

[02:08] <ugexe> if precomp can switch to proc::async it might fix some of these issues

[02:08] <eveo> Ah, cool. I believe Proc will soon be made in terms of Proc::Async

[02:09] <ugexe> its mostly just once proc::async exists for jvm, so hopefully soon

[02:11] <ugexe> then zef will switch back to proc::async too, so hopefully less problems all around

[12:08] <eveo> wonder why Proc::Async.kill doesn't always kill. Another module seems to be hanging now. They're all supposed to get killed after 5 minutes

[12:09] <eveo> and Proc::Q sends SIGTERM first and a second later SIGSEGV: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Proc-Q/blob/master/lib/Proc/Q.pm6#L46-L47

[12:09] <eveo> But that doesn't help, eventhough when I send SIGTERM from htop, the process dies and the toasting run continues then

[12:10] <MasterDuke> jnthn: do you have any suggestions for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1098 ? making `key` also Mu doesn't work (e.g., `my Str %h{Int}; say %h<a> = "b"` succeeds, where now (and with the PR) it complains about `binding to parameter 'key'`)

[14:40] <lizmat> dogbert17: could be an oversight

[14:41] <dogbert17> lizmat: I was going to document it but that part confused me so I had to ask

[14:42] <lizmat> feels to me it should create a Supply much like (1,2,3).Supply, except it would only produce a single Supply type object

[14:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5c56e9: OUTPUT: «(Supply)␤»

[14:45] * dogbert17 wonders if the doc should say 'returns the invocant'

[14:46] <eveo> dogbert17: fwiw, there are some inconsistencies in the codebase in that area. For example Rat.Rat throws, while Date.Date returns self, while Set.Set returns set(Set), while Instant.Instant doesn't even exist. And there's no one-fits-all solution, so the entire codebase should be checked for this stuff and then figured out what SomeObj.SomeObj is meant to return

[14:47] <eveo> like Set.Set is already good as lizmat++ stated above Supply:U.Supply should probably do the same, and all the types that contain stuff should probably do that for :U of self.

[14:58] <dogbert17> eveo: thx for the information

[15:00] <dogbert17> anyone wants to fix it or should I, i.e. PR?

[16:26] <eveo> Probably 10 percentage points too high than reality. I still had to kill some modules manually because I don't know why Proc::Q fails to kill them after timeout

[17:59] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1099

[18:53] * BenGoldberg wonders if for (Range) gets optimized into a c-style loop.

[18:59] <MasterDuke> Ranges do get some optimization in Optimize.nqp, but they still end up slower than a c-style loop

[19:05] <timotimo> they only rarely actually get the optimization; the qast around for loops has changed often and the optimizer hasn't been changed to match

[19:06] <timotimo> also, it only works for literal ranges with constant endpoints

[19:23] <BenGoldberg> MasterDuke, Depending on how long it takes to call @s.elems, it might be good to change those loops to: loop (my int $i = @s.elems; $i >= 1; $i = $i - 1), to avoid the repeated method call.

[22:51] <jnthn> *sigh* coercion really needs another look

[22:52] * geekosaur still has notes from last time it came up... but not much on possible answers

[22:52] <jnthn> I think based on what the synopses speculated, though, we should really compile A(value) as `value.can('A') ?? value.'A'() !! value.new(A)`

[22:52] <jnthn> d'oh

[22:52] <jnthn> `value.can('A') ?? value.'A'() !! A.new(value)` I meant :)
