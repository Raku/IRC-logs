[04:26] <pharv> hey all, i just wanna say thank you for your dedication and commitment to making perl6 a success... back in 2012, when i was doing perl5 development, my coworkers convinced me that perl6 was dead and that switching languages would be a good career move... i then took a job as a php/symfony developer and have been doing that since... although i enjoyed symfony development and was even pleased at the introduction of php7, i felt like

[04:26] <pharv> it was still lacking in some areas... i just recently started reading up on perl6 again and was pleasantly surprised at the tremendous progress that has been made and how modern the language really is... so, thank you

[05:29] <llfourn> pharv++ # here,here

[05:29] <yoleaux> 28 Jul 2017 16:54Z <nadim> llfourn: I founf what the problem was in my code; I have unit module X ; use Y ; use Z ; sub want_this_sub{} ; When unit module X is after the 'use's it works, as if require did not put it in the right unit.

[05:29] <AlexDaniel> pharv: \o/ thank you

[05:32] <llfourn> .tell nadim Thanks for suffering to figure out that problem. Did you manage to make an RT? It still sounds like a bug.

[05:32] <yoleaux> llfourn: I'll pass your message to nadim.

[05:33] <pharv> i would love to give back to the community, but C is just way too low level for me, so i'm gonna have to find some packages to help out with... i'm considering Bailador, since it seems to have a lot of contributors and momentum

[05:41] <AlexDaniel> pharv: but it's not just C. Most of Rakudo is written in PerlÂ 6

[05:41] <pharv> oh, then maybe i can help :)

[12:20] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/nom:

[12:20] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/nom: which isn't too useful with multis.  It now also adds the signature,

[12:20] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo/nom: so that you can more easily figure out which candidate was called.

[12:26] <timotimo> nice

[13:38] <samcv> i'm still getting a failing 'require' test, seems to have been failing for weeks now

[13:39] <samcv> weird it's not failing when i run it manually

[13:40] <jnthn> samcv: Me also fwiw

[13:41] <jnthn> I think it also passed reliably if make install was done prior to make spectest, but I may be misremembering

[13:42] <lizmat> fwiw, I've seen the require test flapping *after* a make install

[13:46] <samcv> oh and i'm adding MVM_string_codes to make .codes faster

[13:46] <samcv> do we want the nqp op called nqp::codes or nqp::codes_s. probably just codes?

[13:46] <samcv> it's not currently added to nqp

[13:46] <samcv> but is in MVM's oplist even though it just returns the number of graphemes currently

[13:48] <jnthn> samcv: just nqp::codes I think
