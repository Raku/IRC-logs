[05:45] <[Tux]> but the box was relatively busy. I'm away most of the day, that's why I post them this early. Might re-try when I return

[21:38] <yoleaux> Zoffix: go through ecosystem and convert .child -> .add

[21:39] <[Coke]> .seen zoffix?

[21:39] <yoleaux> I haven't seen zoffix? around.

[21:39] <[Coke]> .seen zoffix

[21:39] <yoleaux> I saw Zoffix 16 Nov 2017 03:26Z in #perl6-dev: <Zoffix> Well, make your own fucking brochure then.

[21:39] <[Coke]> oops.

[21:40] <perlpilot> now I want to grep the log to see what that was in response to.

[21:45] <lizmat> Well, I gotta give Zoffix a point:  I mean, using pictures with well known Perl people was shot down, now using stock pictures of modules is show down

[21:45] <lizmat> *shot

[21:45] <lizmat> *sigh*

[21:45] <lizmat> no good deed shall go unpunished :-(

[21:50] <[Coke]> FWIW, I like the last version of the brochure I saw that had the stock pictures.

[21:50] <perlpilot> me too

[22:00] <lizmat> something different:

[22:00] <lizmat> there's this thread on perl6-users: https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2017/11/msg4582.html

[22:01] <lizmat> and my answer so far is: https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2017/11/msg4598.html

[22:01] <lizmat> but that involves using nqp ops

[22:02] <lizmat> So I was thinking: maybe a simple addition to the Attribute class could make this all NQP agnostic

[22:03] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/6da5506c53c3f1740e9b0704e276912f   # Attribute.get/bind

[22:04] <lizmat> which would reduce my solution to: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/a62eca1026dd3d6e958334e3275f2132

[22:05] <lizmat> which would be NQP agnostic and very useful for people wanting to write Attribute traits

[22:05] <lizmat> jnthn timotimo moritz masak TimToady  comments ?

[22:11] <moritz> lizmat: Attribute already has a get_value method, no?

[22:11] <moritz> and set_value too

[22:12] <lizmat> ah, duh  :-)

[22:15] <lizmat> moritz++

[22:15] * lizmat clearly needs some rest

[22:15] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev!

[22:16] <perlpilot> good night lizmat.  sleep well.

[22:16] <jnthn> Only thing to note is that I think set_value assigns, and so there may be room for a bind_value

[22:20] <moritz> agreed
