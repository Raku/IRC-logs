[01:14] <AlexDaniel> samcv: any news on RT #131961? Or if not, was there anything interesting you were able to find? I'm thinking maybe we can leave something in a comment on that ticket to help the thing go

[01:14] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131961

[01:15] <samcv> well i am not sure what's causing it. though it now doesn't leak memory when it throws, and now frees the bytes in the buffer

[01:15] <samcv> but otherwise no

[01:26] <AlexDaniel> wait, I didn't bisect this ticket?

[01:27] <AlexDaniel> .oO( why???? )

[01:28] <AlexDaniel> makes no sense. I'll get some tea and will bisect it. Who knows, maybe it'll give a clue

[01:55] <AlexDaniel> bisected to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/51b63bf9f0d0594687908f0756774f29cde39c1f

[01:57] <AlexDaniel> but I don't know if it means anything

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> but I was seeing something like this a few weeks before that commit: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/153

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> it may be a different issue

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> how can I test it? I guess simply try it with a bigger file?

[02:06] <AlexDaniel> samcv: yes, that's the right commit. Before that it can go through 251MB file just fine

[02:07] <AlexDaniel> … “commit”. One of 15 MoarVM commits I mean

[02:10] <AlexDaniel> .tell [Coke] A *tiny* update on the Malformed UTF-8 issue. There's hope! https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131961#txn-1486102

[02:10] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to [Coke].

[02:17] <samcv> AlexDaniel, well decodestream was changed

[02:17] <samcv> it's possible that or the utf8 changes caused it

[02:18] <samcv> i can't compile nqp right now though..

[02:18] <samcv> anyone else have this?

[02:21] <geekosaur> nqp built for me a couple hours ago

[02:34] <ugexe> I wrote a quick example of how to get appveyor build status changes in an irc channel by slapping together Cro and IRC::Client - https://gist.github.com/ugexe/a7724886674ffef74f656f93f0b8a8cf

[02:35] <Zoffix> wooo \o/ ugexe++

[04:05] <AlexDaniel> alright, it's https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/a6abd3c6654413d2230470dbaa82b7b3a2b05762

[04:06] <AlexDaniel> why can't I teach bisectable to do it? Why? :-/

[04:08] <samcv> AlexDaniel++ should let jnthn know maybe he can figure it out better than I, since he wrote it

[04:08] <AlexDaniel> .tell jnthn FWIW https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131961#txn-1486128

[04:08] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[04:30] <AlexDaniel> .tell timotimo ping me when you have 15 minutes for me

[04:30] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to timotimo.

[04:42] <samcv> that nqp commit that disabled repl on tty i think broke roast tests

[04:42] <samcv> that wanted the output of the REPL

[04:42] <samcv> maybe we need an ENV var to enable it or a flag

[04:43] <samcv> like one to force repl and one to force no-repl

[13:58] <AlexDaniel> by the way, maybe somebody has some interesting ideas on this: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/40#issuecomment-326300469

[13:58] <AlexDaniel> mainly the question is: if nqp bump in rakudo brought more than one nqp commit, what's the right way to bisect it?

[14:02] <nine> Zoffix++ # really awesome blog post

[14:02] <lizmat> someone should put Zoffix' blog post on HN

[14:10] <brrt> someone with a flame-retardant suit

[14:10] <brrt> or a 'thick skin' or what have you

[14:15] <timotimo> i just realized i never told anyone my lightning talk would be okay to record & upload

[14:15] <timotimo> so it probably won't appear on youtube

[14:15] <timotimo> which is a good thing because i could re-make it as a much more structured (and rehearsed) screencast or something

[14:18] <brrt> (also, Zoffix++, i enjoyed that post)

[14:21] <timotimo> yes, yes. good post, Zoffix++

[14:21] <MasterDuke> are the SPW videos going up under a particular account?

[20:19] <lizmat> MasterDuke: and that we could use some more tests :-)

[20:20] <lizmat> indeed  :-)

[20:23] <MasterDuke> well, i'm certainly open to help/advice/correction/etc from anybody, i'd be lying if i said i completely understand how INTERPOLATE is working (or should)

[21:27] <japhb> huggable: speed

[21:27] <huggable> japhb, http://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/speed4.html

[21:27] <japhb> buggable: speed

[21:27] <buggable> japhb, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? data for 2017-07-30–2017-08-31; range: 3.471s–4.925s; 21% faster

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> this graph needs a logarithmic scale

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> maybe

[21:45] <japhb> AlexDaniel: the problem with logarithmic scale is what your zero point is, because it can't actually be zero.

[21:45] <japhb> Plus that last pixel or two makes a HUGE difference to the experienced speed out of proportion to the visual difference.

[21:46] <japhb> The current code is designed to look kinda like it feels:  The above is "Slow for a while, then a bit faster, then slow again (with one measurement REALLY slow), then getting back to faster again.

[21:47] <japhb> "

[21:48] <japhb> Sadly unicode doesn't offer 16- or 32-unit-high bars

[21:48] <japhb> For increased precision

[21:49] <japhb> Though now that I think of it, I suppose buggable could rapidly answer *twice* and stack the two rows into a double-high chart for more precision.

[21:49] <japhb> Oooh, I think I'm going to use this locally.

[21:50] <japhb> Where is the buggable code?

[21:50] <japhb> buggable: source

[21:50] <buggable> japhb, See: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable

[21:53] <jdv79> is the optimization techniques deployed in moar similar to a tracing jit?

[21:53] <jdv79> i just remember the term and not any specifics

[21:57] <jdv79> is the irc log site going to be fixed for unicode anytime soon?

[21:58] <jdv79> I'd look into it if its something i could fix.  its not great to keep seeking ? chars all the time when backlogging.

[22:02] <MasterDuke> jdv79: moritz and Zoffix have chatted about it a couple times, i think moritz said it's a mysql thing. could try searching the logs (either here or #perl6, don't remember which) for details

[22:02] <MasterDuke> hm, maybe it was moritz and AlexDaniel

[22:03] <jdv79> didn't it used to work?

[22:04] <jdv79> i feel like it did cause i think i saw some unicode stuff in those logs before i updated my fonts so my term didn't bork them

[22:04] <jdv79> moritz: what's the status of that?  is there a ticket or anything else?

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> jdv79: I looked at it a little bit but didn't make much progress

[22:08] <MasterDuke> jdv79: moritz said he was going to sleep a little while ago, so you'll probably have to wait until tomorrow to chat with him

[22:12] <AlexDaniel> jdv79: here's the last discussion: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-08-22#i_15056532

[22:20] <MasterDuke> another question about INTERPOLATE: i'm trying to correctly use index instead of eqat. just doing s/eqat/index/ fails this test

[22:20] <MasterDuke> m: use Test; is "foobar" ~~ /$( $_.substr(3) )/, "bar", "Contextualizer with functions calls";

[22:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar d13572: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - Contextualizer with functions calls?»

[22:21] <MasterDuke> instead i get: # Failed test 'Contextualizer with functions calls' # at -e line 1 # expected: 'bar' #      got: 'foobar'

[22:21] <MasterDuke> fyi, this is my patch: https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/c9512590df63bd530b640464ad04103f

[22:22] <MasterDuke> afk for a bit, but i'll backlog for suggestions

[22:47] <japhb> If I want to return something multi-line from a buggable plugin, do I need to return a list or something \n separated?

[22:47] <japhb> Zoffix: ^^

[22:48] <japhb> Also, will each line be prefixed with "$nick, " ?

[22:50] <japhb> FWIW, the code I have now can handle anything from 1-4 rows (the code can handle any number, but I figured > 4 was rude to the channel).  It looks like this:

[22:50] <japhb> ???         ?            ?? ?????????????          dates: 2017-07-30–2017-08-31

[22:50] <japhb> ?????????????     ?      ????????????????          range: 3.471s–4.925s

[22:50] <japhb> ?????????????    ??      ???????????????? ??? ?    speed: 21% faster
