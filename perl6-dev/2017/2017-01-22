[01:00] <TimToady> huh

[01:00] <brokenchicken> from perldoc: "For integer conversions, specifying a precision implies that the output of the number itself should be zero-padded to this width, where the 0 flag is ignored:"

[01:00] <geekosaur> that's also ANSI C

[01:03] <TimToady> that's also wrong

[01:03] <TimToady> should be minimum for d

[01:04] <brokenchicken> will fix

[01:04] <TimToady> it can be inferred from the system sprintf docs that a %.3d should have minimum 3 digits, so obviously those extra digits would have to be 0

[12:21] <bartolin> thanks :-)

[12:30] <lizmat> bartolin++  # for chasing JVM issues!

[12:41] <dogbert17> lizmat: is https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/b052a9da0457916c5f8300990cdad35f affected by the grep deopt made recently? Runs twice as slowly on head compared to 2016.12 and older

[12:41] <lizmat> dogbert17: yeah, I saw it

[12:41] <lizmat> but if we want to support redo in a grep, there is no way around it that I can see at the moment

[12:42] <dogbert17> just wanted to make sure it wasn't something else, i.e. something unintended

[12:42] <lizmat> it sucks, since redo is dynamic, so we can't even inspect the block in the optimizer for use of redo

[12:43] <lizmat> the only way that jnthn pointed out, was to have goto working :-)

[12:43] <lizmat> then we wouldn't need to penalize all greps for the use of redo

[12:43] <dogbert17> so it might be fixed in time then?

[12:44] <lizmat> yes, once we have goto

[12:44] <dogbert17> cool

[12:44] <lizmat> fwiw, this would benefit *all* map processing, not just grep

[12:44] <lizmat> because everywhere we need to support redo, we need to build another layer of loop around everything to support it

[12:45] <lizmat> $redo = 1; while $redo { $redo = 0; call block }

[12:45] <dogbert17> will it go back to the speed it had in 2016.12 ot will it be even faster with goto

[12:45] <lizmat> it should go back to the speed we had, not faster

[12:47] <timotimo> did you see how i built redo for whenever blocks?

[12:47] <lizmat> timotimo: not yet

[12:47] <timotimo> i put the loop in separately, only to be entered once we actually hit the redo handler once

[12:47] <timotimo> perhaps that could be done here as well

[12:48] <timotimo> i.e. { call block; CONTROL { when 'redo' { $redo = 1; while $redo { $redo = 0; call block } } } }

[12:48] <timotimo> i *think* we only pay if redo was actually used if the code is like that

[12:48] <timotimo> but i haven't measured

[12:58] <dogbert17> timotimo lizmat: should this snippet hang?

[12:58] <dogbert17> m:   m: class SQLString { }; my $stringy = Str.^find_method("Stringy"); my $handler = $stringy.wrap(method () { SQLString.new(:str(callsame)) }); say "foo".Stringy # should this loop indefinitely?

[12:59] <dogbert17> m: class SQLString { }; my $stringy = Str.^find_method("Stringy"); my $handler = $stringy.wrap(method () { SQLString.new(:str(callsame)) }); say "foo".Stringy # should this loop indefinitely?

[12:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3c86d: OUTPUT«(timeout)»

[12:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3c86d: OUTPUT«(timeout)»

[12:59] <timotimo> Stringy has always had a tendency to cause endless loops

[13:00] <lizmat> perhaps we need to look at what you're trying to achieve ?

[13:01] <dogbert17> nothing :) took it from a MoarVM bug report, it used to crash before jnthn made a callsame fix

[13:02] <dogbert17> if the snippet is supposed to loop endlessly I think the original bug can be cinsidered fixed

[13:02] <dogbert17> *considered

[13:05] <dogbert17> it's from https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/412

[13:18] <lizmat> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-to-block-jar-files-signed-with-md5-starting-with-april-2017/  # does this affect our use of the JVM backend ?

[13:22] <timotimo> i'm not sure we sign our .jar files at all?

[13:24] * lizmat has no idea

[13:25] <timotimo> but i expect it's a trivial matter to use a different hash there. like, changing a commandline flag or something

[21:26] <MasterDuke> lizmat: no noticeable difference

[21:26] <lizmat> ok, I guess the optimizer / spesh / JIT are doing their work then  :-)

[21:36] <MasterDuke> in rakudo/src there are 158 `{*}` and 337 `{ * }`. anybody have strong opinions about whether we should be consistent? and if so, which way?

[21:37] * brokenchicken has no opinion

[21:37] <timotimo> fewer spaces to make parsing faster!!!!!!k ;)

[21:37] <brokenchicken> :)

[21:38] <MasterDuke> not entirely a bad idea: https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/7723025658833476d5f312805c3274b5#file-compile_profile_20170115_results-csv-L8

[21:39] <timotimo> We can make this file beautiful and searchable if this error is corrected: It looks like row 97 should actually have 1 column, instead of 2.

[21:39] <timotimo> oh?

[21:39] <MasterDuke> _ws and ws are #8 and #18 by exclusive time for profile-compile of a rakudo build

[21:40] <MasterDuke> github thinks it's a csv, so the infix<,> messes it up

[21:40] <timotimo> ah, hehehe

[21:40] <timotimo> pretty good

[21:40] * MasterDuke is partially to blame for naming the file .csv

[21:41] <timotimo> tsv would be better, because i'm pretty sure we don't have an operator \t so far :D

[21:41] <moritz> not YET :-)

[21:42] <timotimo> is probably possible to put in already

[21:47] <RabidGravy> I keep meaning to post this with regard to the performance thing as it seemed pertinent http://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains

[22:32] <timotimo> m: my int @a[3] = 0, 1, 2; @a = (1,); dd @a

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«array[int].new(:shape(3,), [1, 1, 2])␤»

[22:32] <timotimo> at least it's consistent with that?

[22:33] <lizmat> yes, it is

[22:33] <lizmat> but I'm thinking, suppose we pass an array to a module somewhere, and that module does = () thinking it initializes it

[22:34] <lizmat> m: sub a(@a) { @a = () }; a(my @a[3] = (42,66,666)); dd @a

[22:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«Array.new(:shape(3,), [42, 66, 666])␤»

[22:35] <lizmat> m: sub a(@a) { @a = () }; a(my @a = (42,66,666)); dd @a

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«Array @a = []␤»

[22:35] <lizmat> feels a bit like a footgun to me

[22:36] <lizmat> unless we can actually have something in a signature to match shaped arrays

[22:37] <lizmat> I came across this while investigating the native shaped array coverage, which is minimal atm

[22:37] <timotimo> m: my int @a[3] = 9, 9, 9; @a = Empty; dd @a

[22:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«array[int].new(:shape(3,), [9, 9, 9])␤»

[22:37] <timotimo> to me, that's more footgunny, as it explicitly says "empty"

[22:37] <lizmat> yup

[22:37] <timotimo> but i really need sleep now

[22:37] <lizmat> timotimo: good night, sleep tight!

[22:37] <timotimo> i'll do my best! :)

[23:13] <jnthn> At the same time, `@shaped-array = @replace-first-elems-with-this` working fine then exploding when the second array contains zero elems would be a nasty discontinuity.

[23:14] <jnthn> Not sure we should break a useful thing's boundary case for the sake of a footgun.

[23:14] <lizmat> well, I'm working on adding a warning, would that be ok ?

[23:15] <jnthn> Not really :(

[23:15] <lizmat> also for the () case ?

[23:15] <jnthn> I mean, I guess you could put quietly but it's still a discontinuity

[23:15] <jnthn> Can we distinguish Empty?

[23:15] <jnthn> I can go with warning on Empty

[23:15] <jnthn> m: say |()

[23:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«␤»

[23:15] <jnthn> m: say (|()).perl

[23:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar e195e5: OUTPUT«slip()␤»

[23:15] <jnthn> OK, good, we can distinguish that from Empty :)

[23:16] <jnthn> I'm fine with the warning on Empty

[23:16] <lizmat> ok

[23:16] <lizmat> but then I will need to rethink the code and warning

[23:16] <lizmat> and that will be tomorrow  :-)

[23:17] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm gonna turn in too :)

[23:17] <jnthn> busy day for me tomorrow; likely won't be around all that much.

[23:17] <lizmat> ok, sleep well!

[23:18] <jnthn> Thanks, you also :)
