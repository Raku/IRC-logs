[20:25] <AlexDaniel> samcv?++

[20:52] <[Coke]> so, how goes the SA?

[22:55] <Zoffix> Is there any good reason why roast doesn't default to using, say, TEST_JOBS=6 instead of 1?

[22:57] <Zoffix> Want to make it default to 6, so anyone isn't aware of needing to set jobs isn't waiting half hour for finish. Also, seems rakudo star's `make rakudos-spectest` doesn't set test jobs either, so instructions for install ask the user to run a half-hour command

[22:59] <Zoffix> Oh, nevermind, looks like it does set something. Took just 4m to run: Files=1092, Tests=51258, 278 wallclock secs ( 7.61 usr  1.77 sys + 812.02 cusr 170.77 csys = 992.17 CPU)

[22:59] <Zoffix> oh wait, I have TEST_JOBS set by default -_-

[23:00] <Zoffix> :)

[23:01] <Zoffix> yeah, it's a lot slower with TEST_JOBS unset :)
