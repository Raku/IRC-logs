[01:20] <brokenchicken> I guess everyone's away now?

[01:22] <brokenchicken> I need to change 6.c-errata here: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/6.c-errata/S32-exceptions/misc.t#L132

[01:22] <brokenchicken> It now throws X::Syntax::Reserved instead of X::Syntax::Extension::Category, because :sym<> is now marked as reserved per TimToady https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-01-25#i_13988093

[01:23] <brokenchicken> Is it OK to make that change?

[01:23] <brokenchicken> jnthn lizmat TimToady [Coke] ping

[01:23] <brokenchicken> Or should that part wait for 6.d

[01:26] <brokenchicken> And the change would be to remove the 'sym' part; so it'd end up as throws-like 'sub postbla:<foo>() { }', X::Syntax::Extension::Category, category => 'postbla';

[01:29] <brokenchicken> Eh, screw it. I'll leave it to 6.d. It's bad to change 6.c-errata

[15:46] <AlexDaniel> brokenchicken: I'm not sure I understand

[15:46] <AlexDaniel> brokenchicken: the fact the tag was not pulled is an issue in the whateverable build script

[15:46] <AlexDaniel> but what is this:

[15:47] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¦«78980ed»: v2016.12.409.g.78980.ed

[15:48] <AlexDaniel> why is it 2016.12? Am I missing something?

[15:48] <brokenchicken> AlexDaniel: that usually happens when you just do `make install` instead of running Configure.pl again

[15:48] <brokenchicken> AlexDaniel: or if the tag is missing

[15:49] <brokenchicken> But in my checkout I just do `git pull` and tags get pulled. The one time they didn't get pulled is when I fucked up the release and the tag was not on the same tree as master

[15:49] <AlexDaniel> ooooh, hmmmm

[15:50] <MasterDuke> i believe git changed the default pull behavior sometime

[15:50] <AlexDaniel> so all whateverable builds are wrong?

[15:50] <MasterDuke> from not pulling tags to pulling tags, so maybe a git version difference?

[15:50] <AlexDaniel> well, not very wrong, but just have a wrong version

[15:54] <brokenchicken> weird

[15:54] <brokenchicken> 2016.09 and 2016.10 were cut by the bot too

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> no-no, that's not your problem I'm pretty sure

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> I we rebuilt everything from scratch in 2016.10 or something like that

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> think

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> benchable6: HEAD,2016.12 for ^1000 { $ = $_ for "/home/bisectable/.bash_history".IO.lines };

[16:05] <benchable6> MasterDuke, starting to benchmark the 2 given commits

[16:05] <MasterDuke> pretty sure you have to put them in order

[16:06] <brokenchicken> Checked out 2016.11 tag on a fresh checkout and when it built reported correct version. Don't see any commits to rakudo/tools between 2016.10 and 2016.11 releases that changed anything that might've messed anything up. So looks like the glitch is not on rakudo side :)

[16:06] <brokenchicken> .oO( I hope )

[16:06] <benchable6> MasterDuke, benchmarked the given commits, now zooming in on performance differences

[16:06] <benchable6> MasterDuke, ¦«2016.12»:8.9363␤¦«HEAD»:8.1006

[16:07] <brokenchicken> There's been a ton of commits since 2016.12, including improvements in MoarVM. I'm not surprised to see it faster

[16:07] <nine> I now have version of Inline::Perl5 that work pre and post lexical_module_loading. But a version that works in both cases still eludes me.

[16:15] <brokenchicken> :)

[16:16] <nine> But....I since I need a small change to rakudo anyway, I can just pass a switch to Inline::Perl5::require so it knows when to use the new behavior.

[16:18] <nine> Not exactly elegant, but that's the nature of backwards compatibility.

[16:21] <jnthn> pmurias: Lexical scoping of QAST blocks is determined by nesting one within the other, though the specifics vary between immediate, declaration, etc.

[16:22] <jnthn> pmurias: In the case of defaults in signautres, I think the slow-path (non-lowered) binder does a little trickery to make sure it invokes the default with the right outer, by doing a search on the call stack for the nearest frame that matches the static outer

[16:23] <jnthn> pmurias: iirc there's a p6invokeunder or some similar named op involved in this

[16:30] <nine> Ok, now it works pre-lexical_module_load, post-lexical_module_load and in the new world after my change to rakudo :)

[21:21] <MasterDuke> samcv++

[21:22] <samcv> just gotta run spectest again

[21:22] <samcv> now that i've added some #define's for the Numeric_type's values to the unicode database generation script, so can be stable

[21:23] <MasterDuke> ah, you can do *property_int() now?

[21:25] <samcv> yeah

[21:25] <MasterDuke> nice

[21:27] <samcv> i guess i could do property_int(general_category), but i'm doing property_int(numeric_type)

[21:27] <samcv> the general category can be sped up when i do the rewrite. we have one enum that holds all the values of general category

[21:27] <samcv> what we really want is two, one for the first letter one for the second

[21:33] <jdv79> not sure why.  i assume the scheduler is using a fifo.

[21:34] <jdv79> i should probably print stuff..

[21:34] <lizmat> jdv79: are many threads in await state ?

[21:34] <jdv79> thanks lizmat

[21:34] <jdv79> there are only 25 or so promisies

[21:34] <lizmat> if so, you might want to do "use v6.d.PREVIEW"

[21:34] <jdv79> but if i duck below roughtly 16 it chugs along just fine

[21:35] <lizmat> which has non-blocking await

[21:38] <jdv79> k

[22:25] <jnthn> I'd Seq.from-loop as a fairly useful Seq factory method, along the lines of the many we have on Supply

[22:32] <jnthn> It golfs pretty easily at least :)

[22:32] <lizmat> yeah, I was very glad to have found that one  :-)

[22:33] <lizmat> it seems connected to binding

[22:33] <lizmat> if I assign, the problem goes away, but then I get stuff inside a container and then nqp::eqaddr(...,IterationEnd) doesn't work

[22:34] <lizmat> m: my $a = IterationEnd; use nqp; say nqp::eqaddr($a,IterationEnd)

[22:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar af4902: OUTPUT«0␤»

[22:34] <lizmat> m: my $a := IterationEnd; use nqp; say nqp::eqaddr($a,IterationEnd)

[22:34] <jnthn> m: use nqp; my $a; { nqp::handle(($a := 42), 'NEXT', $a) }

[22:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar af4902: ( no output )

[22:34] <jnthn> Just lifting the decl up a level will prevent the opt, I guess

[22:35] <lizmat> in this case it does, more generally it doesn't  :-(

[22:35] <lizmat> m: my $a = IterationEnd; use nqp; say nqp::eqaddr(nqp::decont($a),IterationEnd)

[22:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar af4902: OUTPUT«1␤»

[22:35] <lizmat> I guess I could try that

[22:36] <jnthn> Do you ever have something more complex in the handle than the variable reference itself?

[22:36] <jnthn> In the bit after the NEXT, I mean

[22:37] <lizmat> jnthn: yes

[22:37] <lizmat> nqp::stmts( stuffthis, stuffthat )

[22:37] <jnthn> OK, then there's no easy hack for Perl6::Optimizer

[22:37] <jnthn> It's doable

[22:38] <jnthn> But would need to add tracking of what things are seen in a handles branch

[22:38] <jnthn> And poison the opts

[22:38] <lizmat> feels tricky  :-)

[22:38] <jnthn> Yeah.

[22:38] <jnthn> A little

[22:39] <jnthn> Oh

[22:39] <jnthn> Did you try putting a block as the thing after NEXT?

[22:39] <jnthn> Perhaps directly invoking it?

[22:39] <jnthn> That'd also poison it

[22:39] <jnthn> m: use nqp; { nqp::handle((my $a := 42), 'NEXT', $a) }

[22:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar af4902: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Cannot reference undeclared local '__lowered_lex_1'␤»

[22:39] <jnthn> m: use nqp; { nqp::handle((my $a := 42), 'NEXT', { $a }()) }

[22:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar af4902: ( no output )

[22:40] <jnthn> Like that

[22:40] <lizmat> well, putting blocks at some places helps, but comes at an enormous performance impact

[22:40] <lizmat> so instead of winning 8%, I lose 9%  :-(

[22:41] <lizmat> anyways, I've used up my tuits for today

[22:41] <lizmat> good night!

[22:42] <jnthn> Yeah, I sure don't have energy to do the Perl6::Optimizer patch today either, I'm afraid... Can see what's needed though.

[22:42] <jnthn> 'night

[22:55] <brokenchicken> night
