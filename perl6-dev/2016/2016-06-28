[18:48] <DrForr_> Is there enough information in QAST:: to reconstruct Perl source, or should I rely on the parse tree alone?

[18:49] <pyrimidine> when I see optimize-with-hoopl I think of Deadwood

[18:49] <DrForr_> I'd love to be able to proxy or sublass Perl6::Actions, but I'm not sure that's possible.

[23:35] <tbrowder> I'm trying to work on a p6 pod problem and need some help

[23:39] <tbrowder> at least one part of the problem (p6 pod tables) is in rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp and I need to be able to run a script to use that file and add some pront debug statements

[23:40] <tbrowder> so a short cookbook answer to feed a chunk of pod to those subs would be very helpful

[23:55] * ZoffixLappy just built rakudo after making changes.

[23:55] <ZoffixLappy> But your way makes a lot more sense lol :D
