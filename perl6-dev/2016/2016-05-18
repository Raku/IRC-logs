[07:03] <[Tux]> whishlist: 1. utf8-c8, 2. performance

[07:03] <jnthn> morning, #perl6-dev

[07:03] <[Tux]> !gr jnthn

[07:04] <jnthn> Hm, wasn't utf8-c8 already fixed, or is there still something wrong with it?

[07:04] <jnthn> Guess RT will tell :)

[07:05] <[Tux]> May 15 13:16:25 <[Tux]> #      got: Buf.new(61,147,135,8,82,78,208,66,204,162,205,164,140,97,175,37,108,194,27,192,119)

[07:06] <[Tux]> that last one is an interesting one: it swaps two pairs

[07:06] <[Tux]> 205,164,204,162 => 204,162,205,164

[07:07] <[Tux]> I use http://www.xs4all.nl/~hmbrand/88.t to verify

[07:16] <nine> Is it worrysome that I dreamed most of the night about QASTs and debug output?

[07:17] <JimmyZ> you must lost some vervy very good code somewhere ;)

[07:18] <jnthn> nine: Well, you're not the only one it's happened to, at least... :P

[07:19] <nine> Comforting thought :)

[08:08] <timotimo> right, we're still reading past the end of the input buffer in that one case in utf8-c8

[15:25] <psch> bartolin: spectest looks rather bad, compared to the last time i ran it at least

[15:26] <psch> https://gist.github.com/peschwa/db0e2c2cdf641bdaf4221a81a3b08369

[18:14] <bartolin> psch: oh! I pasted my results as a comment to your gist: https://gist.github.com/peschwa/db0e2c2cdf641bdaf4221a81a3b08369#gistcomment-1780888

[18:15] <bartolin> ooc, did you build with --gen-nqp=master, too?

[18:15] <bartolin> my spectest run from this morning looks pretty good ...

[18:15] <psch> bartolin: no, i changed NQP_REVISION to the version i mentioned yesterday, 2016.04-108-g6010bd6

[18:16] <psch> that's 2 commits behind current HEAD, fwiw

[18:16] <bartolin> psch: hmm, that's the same commit I have for nqp

[18:17] <bartolin> s/have/had/  # spectest run this morning

[18:17] <psch> that's a bit weird, honestly

[18:17] <psch> i mean, the big difference in spectest result

[18:18] <psch> well, my rakudo tree has two debug note calls

[18:18] <psch> but i'd hope those don't throw that much of a wrench into things... vOv

[18:18] <bartolin> agreed. did you run with -j X?

[18:18] <bartolin> (I did not)

[18:18] <psch> same

[18:19] <psch> just straight 'make spectest'

[18:19] <psch> no TEST_JOBS, nothing

[18:19] <bartolin> weird, indeed

[18:47] <ugexe> something in the last 8 days has pushed the zef ci test suite on windows appveyor from 45min to 60min and not even being finished

[18:48] <ugexe> i dont know if its precomp or something else because RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 freezes on windows when using it

[18:49] <ugexe> test times on travis-ci linux and osx remain the same

[18:52] <ugexe> if it could finish i suspect it would be around +25-30 minutes from 8 days ago

[19:32] <[Coke]> hoelzro: 125182 is closed - does it have tests?

[19:33] <[Coke]> RT #125182

[19:33] <[Coke]> ... ENOTBOT

[19:44] <[Coke]> I'm going to reject RT #128162 unless someone agress with alex.jakimenko

[19:49] <psch> [Coke]: +1 from me

[19:49] <psch> m: say "".succ

[19:50] <psch> aww

[19:50] <psch> no camelia :/

[19:50] <psch> 19:49 <psch> m: say "".succ

[19:50] <psch> 19:49 <camelia> rakudo-moar e39ce3: OUTPUT«␤»

[19:50] <psch> so yeah, fits

[19:50] <[Coke]> kk

[19:54] <[Coke]> done

[20:00] <hankache> m: say "welcome camelia"

[20:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar e39ce3: OUTPUT«welcome camelia␤»

[20:14] <[Coke]> m: say "moritz++" for ^6

[20:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar e39ce3: OUTPUT«moritz++␤moritz++␤moritz++␤moritz++␤moritz++␤moritz++␤»

[20:28] <tomboy65> better? :D

[20:28] <timotimo> what is?

[20:29] <b2gills> notified of chatroom change

[20:29] <timotimo> oh, ok

[20:57] <hoelzro> [Coke]: yes - https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S03-operators/buf.t#L111

[20:58] <[Coke]> danke.

[20:58] <[Coke]> …I didn't even think to search for the RT #, I'm slipping. :|

[21:07] <[Coke]> btw, rakudo.org has an image that is actually hosted on rakudoperl.org - this means that it's under a different web security policy - I can't see it from work without going to rakudoperl.org first and approving it for this session.

[21:07] <[Coke]> (we should host all the content on the same site.)

[21:08] <hoelzro> [Coke]: if it's any consolation, I dug through git logs to find that out, only to discover that it was tagged with the ticket =/

[21:08] <hoelzro> and I'm the one who added the test, haha

[21:08] <[Coke]> heh. whoops

[21:08] * hoelzro ¯_(ツ)_/¯

[21:09] <[Coke]> I see the first run of the .msi on windows is slow. wonder if we can do more precomp in the next version.

[21:17] <psch> [Coke]: i think what nine++ did recently should allow us to package everything precomp'd

[21:17] <psch> especially for star, considering we expect exactly one set of dependencies

[22:46] <MadcapJake> that could also help travis build times too, I assume.

[22:46] <MadcapJake> (well, outside of rakudo/rakudo, I suppose)
