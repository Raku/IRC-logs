[09:58] <nine> arnsholt: yes

[12:57] <nine> I think https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L3886 is redundant as we already clone @name in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L3862

[12:57] <nine> Or am I missing something?

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom: d43ea07 | niner++ | src/Perl6/World.nqp:

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Remove redundant nqp::clone in symbol_lookup

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom: We already clone @name before creating the AT-KEY lookup a couple of lines

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom: earlier, so we don't have to do it again.

[13:05] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d43ea07032

[13:05] <nine> Well, spectest seems happy without it

[13:09] <mst> nine: btw, did you see I managed to combine my main talk and LT into a single tweet? :D

[13:11] <nine> mst: oh yes, that's just awesome :)

[15:52] <dalek> rakudo/lexical_module_load: 25dd967 | niner++ | src/Perl6/ModuleLoader.nqp:

[15:52] <dalek> rakudo/lexical_module_load: Fix values of lexically imported symbols getting lost

[15:52] <dalek> rakudo/lexical_module_load:

[15:52] <dalek> rakudo/lexical_module_load: Fixup for "Make importing globals from loaded modules lexical"

[16:31] <dalek> roast: 3b8dbdb | usev6++ | S (2 files):

[16:31] <dalek> roast: Change fudging for some tests for rakudo-j

[16:42] <nine> TimToady, lizmat: when I pulled the push Camelia out of my bag, my girlfriend got huge eyes and immediately gave it a place on our living room couch :) http://niner.name/camelia.jpg

[16:47] <timotimo> there's also a simon's cat cat!

[16:48] <timotimo> did your girlfriend's eyes protrude similarly to camelia's eyes? :P

[16:48] <nine> Well not as much ;)

[16:50] <timotimo> that sounds like it'd be healthier

[16:55] <stmuk_> Beverly Hills Teddy Bear Company

[16:56] <stmuk_> Camelia is a high flying butterfly

[18:22] <Zoffix> Is it fine to say @foo».bar will be actually autothreaded sometime in 2018? I'm giving a lightning talk in Toronto and I wanna wow people some concurrency stuff. I don't want to give wrong dates for the authothread stuff.

[18:32] <jnthn> Zoffix: I'd hope that we're there by then. It's not that it's a huge amount of work to make that happen, it's more a matter of wanting to get the various concurrency bugs shaken out really well first.

[18:32] <Zoffix> Cool. Thanks :)

[18:32] <jnthn> Zoffix: I know full well that some programs will have been written with bad assumptions about >>.

[18:33] <jnthn> Zoffix: Which is kinda "tough luck", but we should be pretty confident that the majority using it correctly don't get bitten :)

[18:33] <Zoffix> :)

[18:33] <jnthn> So I'm holding back a bit while we work through more the the concurrency bug hunt tedium :)

[19:19] <AlexDaniel> nine: thinkpad detected :)

[19:38] <timotimo> round thinkpad!

[19:39] <timotimo> mine is rectangular

[19:54] <nine> AlexDaniel: that's my girlfriend's. Mine has the rectangular plug

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> TIL about rectangular plugs…

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> I've never seen one…
