[10:23] <lizmat> Zoffix++   # excellent sorcery  :-)

[10:24] <Zoffix> :)

[10:28] <lizmat> fwiw, I wouldn't be against adapting the merge script to just put empty lines in the setting for lines not included

[10:29] <lizmat> Zoffix: afair, the removal of the lines was done in the parrot days to reduce the parse time on the setting

[10:29] <lizmat> I don't think they matter as much any more

[14:50] <[Coke]> +1 for letting them through unchanged.

[15:24] <lizmat> [Coke]: ??  we don't want to include #jvm lines on a #moar build, do we ?

[15:29] <[Coke]> other than that.

[15:34] <lizmat> ok, testing now

[15:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: - to preserve line number info for mapping setting to original source code

[15:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: - still removes "# vim:" lines (as they are at the end of the file anyways)

[15:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: - still adds a "$# vim:..." line at the end, to force non-modifiability

[15:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[15:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Inspired by http://perl6.party/post/Perl-6-Core-Hacking-Wheres-Da-Sauce-Boss

[22:41] <travis-ci> Rakudo build errored. Elizabeth Mattijsen 'Print newlines only for lines not to be included

[22:41] <buggable> travis-ci, build log missing from at least one job. Check results manually.

[22:46] <timotimo> yeah, there was no output for that one at all

[22:46] <timotimo> it's just noted as a failure for whatever reason
