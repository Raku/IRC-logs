[00:35] <yoleaux2> I saw AlexDaniel 6 Jul 2016 10:57Z in #perl6-dev: <AlexDaniel> if given enough permissions to work on stuff, I can do it. And I think that there are others who will happily help with it. The problem is that we can't decide what we should use instead of RT

[09:37] <psch> huh, 16 commits not enough for "heuristic branch merge"?

[09:38] <timotimo> the dalek exterminates in mysterious ways

[09:39] <psch> there also was a merge commit somewhere in there :P

[09:41] <psch> anyway, yeah, we now have jvminterop that passes all currently existing tests in t/03-jvm/01-interop.t

[09:41] <psch> it's only 26 tests, and they don't really test a lot, but it's something

[09:42] <timotimo> *nice*

[09:42] <timotimo> i was too uninspired to create more tests for that :(

[09:42] <psch> i mean, the branch was pretty much still fine

[09:42] <psch> but i didn't want to merge while we still had the whole install-core-dist.pl problem vOv

[09:43] <psch> well, the current tests do cover most of what works, so idk

[09:44] <timotimo> so only 5% of those tests are actually mine? :)

[09:45] <psch> you wrote tests for jvminterop?

[09:46] <timotimo> maybe?

[09:46] <psch> git says no, blame falls squarely on me for t/03-jvm/01-interop.t

[09:46] <psch> well, at least as of the recent merge

[09:47] <timotimo> OK :)

[09:47] <timotimo> it's probably fine

[09:47] <timotimo> i might not have written tests for in there

[10:40] <MasterDuke> would anyone mind if i try starting a bot here? for background, see http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-07-09#i_12810559

[10:41] <MasterDuke> tldr, since AlexDaniel already has a Rakudo built at every commit for bisectbot, why not make those available to run code like camelia

[11:03] <timotimo> we're not going to have a cameliable, though? :)

[11:04] <MasterDuke> ha. next might be benchable

[11:04] <timotimo> well, camelia can already profile

[11:05] <MasterDuke> i'd forgotten about that, but being able to run the same code at different commits and returning the timing might be useful

[11:06] <timotimo> right

[11:06] <timotimo> that'd require a machine that isn't busy otherwise

[11:06] <timotimo> hack, for example, would be a very bad machine to use

[11:06] <timotimo> or p6c.org in general

[11:23] <lizmat> MasterDuke: perhaps also mention the person who requested it ?

[12:15] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: nice

[12:15] <psch> AlexDaniel: shouldn't it also say which commit it's evaluating on?

[12:15] <psch> like, people eval'ing at nearly the same time does happen

[12:15] <AlexDaniel> psch: sure, but that's the very first version

[12:15] <psch> right, just checking it's on the radar, no pressure :)

[12:15] <AlexDaniel> psch: it gets back to you by using your nick, so that's not a big problem

[12:16] <psch> oh, right, didn't see that

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> committable: 2015.10 say ‘hello’; say ‘oops’

[12:16] <committable> AlexDaniel: hello

[12:16] <committable> ..oops

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> also this ↑ … :)

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> but we will fix that, of course

[12:17] <nine> psch: write your own CompUnit::Repository implementation like CompUnit::Repository::Perl5

[12:17] <nine> src/core/CompUnit/Repository/Perl5

[12:17] <psch> nine: i already have that, it's about what statement_mod:<use> parses and what $*W does with the parse result

[12:18] <psch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L1181 to be precise

[12:18] <nine> psch: use lib 'jar#/foo/bar/jar'; use Foo:from<Java>;

[12:18] <psch> that seems really terrible

[12:18] <AlexDaniel> committable: 2015.10 say ‘hello’; say ‘oops’

[12:18] <committable> AlexDaniel: hello

[12:18] <committable> ..oops

[12:18] <nine> psch: we do the same with Perl 5: use lib:from<Perl5> qw(/foo/bar); use Foo:from<Perl5>;

[12:19] <psch> alright, i'll just go with that then

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> committable: 2015.10 say ‘hello’; say ‘oops’

[12:19] <committable> AlexDaniel: hello␤oops

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> ok

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> committable: 2015.10 exit 5

[12:19] <committable> AlexDaniel: AlexDaniel: ｢exit=5｣

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> committable: 2015.10 say ‘hello’; exit 5

[12:20] <committable> AlexDaniel: AlexDaniel: ｢exit=5｣ hello

[12:20] <nine> psch: it's the same in pure Java, isn't it? You add the jars to the JAVAPATH or whatever it's called and then just load classes

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> very rough but still usable ;)

[12:21] <psch> nine: well, sorta.  you can add paths to the env var or to the java invocation *or* create new classloaders with specific paths during runtime

[12:22] <psch> nine: it's just that architecturally it'd be a lot more obvious to me to create a class loader per jar we want, which is easier if i know per jar where i have to look

[12:22] <psch> but as an obvious solution it might also be somewhat suboptimal :)

[12:23] <psch> so, if i do the <use lib 'path/to.jar'> i get a FileSystem nested inside my RepoRegistry..?

[12:24] <psch> err, not Registry, Repo::Java

[12:44] <tbrowder> [Coke]: Ref using a "writable clone of roast  into t/spec inside the rakudo build dir", can I just move my existing roast repo there and use it to make changes for PRs as usual, i.e., will it continue to function as my local repo without having to have another copy?

[12:45] <timotimo> yeah, git repos should be re-locatable without issue

[12:45] <psch> you could also just set upstream for the repo in t/spec to your fork

[12:45] <psch> potentially only for pushing, too, to make making PRs easier

[12:48] <timotimo> or just git fetch from your local "other checkout" into t/spec and git reset --hard to your HEAD commit from that repo

[12:48] <timotimo> the possibilities are pretty much endless

[12:51] <tbrowder> timtimo: psch: thanks!  I'll probably have more questions later...

[17:20] <psch> pmichaud: what dalek reports is one notable difference

[17:20] <MasterDuke> on a related note...

[17:20] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: https://github.com/perl6/bisectbot/pull/3

[17:20] <Zoffix> pmichaud, most notable is the rakudo/nqp/roast repo commits are announced here and not in #perl6

[17:20] <psch> pmichaud: #perl6 gets roast and ecosystem, this here gets nqp/rakudo

[17:20] <pmichaud> what about language issues?

[17:20] <Zoffix> #perl6 doesn't get roast

[17:21] <psch> pmichaud: #perl6 seems more design and #perl6-dev more impl, from what i see

[17:21] <psch> Zoffix: right, i recall roast commits from today now... not thinking quite clearly :)

[17:21] <pmichaud> psch:  okay, that answers my question.  Thanks

[17:21] <MasterDuke> #perl6 gets doc

[17:21] <Zoffix> :)

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> please don't mind committable, he is one day old :)

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> or she

[17:21] <psch> MasterDuke: right, that was what i was thinking of!

[17:21] <pmichaud> perhaps should be committed.  ALthough in this case perhaps should be uncommitted.

[17:25] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: why not run it on every single commit since 2015.10?

[17:25] <AlexDaniel> and draw a graph or something

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> so let's say every run takes 0.3, we run it 5 times on every commit

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> there are about 2000 commits from 2015.10 till now

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> committable: HEAD say 2000*5*0.3/60

[17:26] <committable> AlexDaniel: 50

[17:26] <pmichaud> afk again... bbl

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> 50 minutes, meh! A bit too long

[17:27] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: yeah, and if you try something that takes a couple seconds...

[17:27] <timotimo> it'd be more sensible to run "daily" commits

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> or just every fifth commit

[17:28] <timotimo> 10 minutes is still alot

[17:28] <AlexDaniel> but then you are not going to see when the slowdown or speedup is

[17:28] <MasterDuke> i guess it depends if the main purpose is to show a general trend, or specifically compare a few commits

[17:28] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: 10 minutes is not so much for a pretty graph :)

[17:29] <timotimo> hm m

[17:29] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, let's have two modes

[17:29] <AlexDaniel> every 20th commit for fast mode and every commit for slow mode

[17:31] <timotimo> you'd get precise results by using cachegrind ... but it'll also make your stuff take 10x as long :)

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> given that we're doing it for a lot of commits, I don't think that a little bit of noise will cause any trouble

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> or maybe it will, dunno, we will see

[17:36] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: ok, I'll work on it once I get back home

[17:36] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: thank you, that's very cool

[17:36] <MasterDuke> sure, it's fun

[18:01] <sortiz> I'm about to submit a PR, but when spectesting got a "Bad plan" in "t/spec/S06-signature/types.t", and indeed seems like a bad plan! So no related with my PR, can someone check that?, I can only count ten tests.

[18:02] <timotimo> throws-like is 3 tests in one function

[18:02] <psch> the number of subtests for throws-like is variable, isn't it?

[18:03] <timotimo> right

[18:03] <sortiz> Yep, but the plan count is at the hi level, no?

[18:03] <psch> as in, every Attribute of the thrown Exception that is checked in the throws-like invocation is its own subtest

[18:03] <timotimo> you can put many tests after the code

[18:03] <timotimo> aye

[18:03] <timotimo> hm

[18:03] <timotimo> a subtest doesn't count into the plan with multiple tests, right?

[18:03] <psch> m: use Test; plan 1; throws-like "a" + 5, Exception

[18:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 959cd3: OUTPUT«1..1␤Cannot convert string to number: base-10 number must begin with valid digits or '.' in '⏏a' (indicated by ⏏)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤# Looks like you planned 1 te…»

[18:03] <psch> m: use Test; plan 1; throws-like '"a" + 5', Exception

[18:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 959cd3: OUTPUT«1..1␤    1..2␤    ok 1 - '"a" + 5' died␤    ok 2 - right exception type (Exception)␤ok 1 - did we throws-like Exception?␤»

[18:04] <psch> that's two tests right there, from the looks of it

[18:04] <psch> we don't have a TAP parser in camelia though

[18:04] <dalek> roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/57d37a48fa

[18:04] <psch> but maybe that's a problem in our harness..?

[18:04] <timotimo> no, it's one test for the "outer" plan

[18:04] <psch> i don't really know TAP

[18:04] <timotimo> the first 1..1 is the amount of tests all in all

[18:04] <psch> ah, alright

[18:04] <timotimo> the 1..2 is the subtests only

[18:05] <psch> yeah, as i said, i don't really know TAP :S

[18:05] <Zoffix> sortiz, try now. I messed up the plan in https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/18fafbddef

[18:05] <timotimo> :)

[18:05] <sortiz> Ah! Zoffix...

[18:05] <timotimo> i only know little bits of tap

[18:05] <timotimo> .o( tap dancing )

[18:05] <Zoffix> subtest counts as 1 test and you can use `plan` inside a subtest to specify the number of tests the subtest should run

[18:07] <Zoffix> and yeah, throws-like uses subtest to run two tests, but it counts as 1 test

[18:08] <timotimo> either way, that coutns as a good catch by sortiz

[18:10] * Zoffix changes the workflow to avoid such fuckups :)

[18:11] <psch> i did have a git precommit hook somewhere that runs the to-be-commited test file with make...

[18:13] <Zoffix> I do that by hand, but I guess I just missed that file (just woke up at that time). I'm gonna put a spectest run in a loop

[21:25] <Zoffix> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[21:27] <Zoffix> As for relaxing... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯... the ticket is about testing the output after exiting. It appears on Linux it prints "> " but on OSX nothing. I just reopened the ticket.

[21:48] <Zoffix> Ah, I see why [possibly] subtest is not fudgeable material.  If you do 2 skip fudge before the subtest, the fudger fudges the subtest... and then 1 test inside of it. Making it fudgeable would involve figuring out how to ignore stuff inside of the subtest.

[21:48] <Zoffix> So it's iffy either way. Either it's not fudgeable or you can't use numbers or you have to write logic to parse out stuff inside the subtest

[21:51] <timotimo> oof

[21:52] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev

[21:52] <Zoffix> night

[21:53] <timotimo> gnite liz

[22:12] <Zoffix> All this talk about fudge makes me want to have some cake.

[22:12] <Zoffix> Coincidentally, I actually do have a piece of chocolate fudge cake.

[22:12] <Zoffix> I blame Perl 6 for making me fat.

[22:14] <timotimo> today i had a little cupcake like thing that was filled with liquid chocolate on the inside

[22:14] <timotimo> it was baked before i ate it

[22:14] <timotimo> it was pretty fantastic

[22:19] <ilmari> chocolate fondant?

[22:20] <timotimo> hm?

[22:20] <ilmari> https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chocolate+fondant&ia=images

[22:21] <timotimo> ah

[22:21] <timotimo> some of those pictures look similar

[22:22] <ilmari> it's yummeh

[22:22] <timotimo> yeah

[22:22] <timotimo> didn't have one of those before

[22:22] * ilmari hasn't had one in a while. not really a summer dessert

[22:26] <timotimo> that's true

[22:55] <sortiz> .tell Zoffix About RT#128000 I'd keep it open 'til solved in core. If only as a way to get some feedback
