[19:05] <ZoffixW> Is there a special rite of passage for me to go through to get commit bits to rakudo/nqp and perms to upload to [email@hidden.address] ? I'm reading the release guides and there are several steps that involve committing, tagging, and uploading.

[19:06] <ZoffixW> And star too, I guess. Are we releasing another star in June? Did anyone sign up to do it?

[19:17] <ZoffixW> Is there a need to make "above zero" a requirement here? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/lib/Test.pm6#L250

[19:17] <ZoffixW> In fact, the current default for $abs_tol is not a valid value

[19:22] <ZoffixW> The whole implementation for that sub kinda relies on both $rel and $abs being provided and they feel like they should be allowed to be separate

[19:24] <ZoffixW> undocumented, unspecced, and unroasted. Sounds like a rewrite free-for-all

[19:26] <lizmat> MasterDuke_: not as far as I know  / realize

[19:27] <ZoffixW> And $desc is a named arg, despite it being a positional one for all other multies :/

[19:28] <lizmat> ZoffixW: fwiw, is_approx was a bit of a mess that we forgot to clean up before Christmas

[19:28] <lizmat> ZoffixW++  # trying to clean up that mes

[19:28] <lizmat> *mess

[19:36] <ZoffixW> Yeah, there's even still an undeprecated is_approx() that seems to do a different thing than is-approx() when called with same args.

[19:37] * ZoffixW will try to find time to look at this stuff tonight
