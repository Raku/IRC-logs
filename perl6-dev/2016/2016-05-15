[19:56] <bartolin> . o O ( #perl6-deutsch )

[19:56] <moritz> timotimo: ilbot3 suffers from throttling just as much as dalek does

[19:56] <mst> IRC says: no breath play without a safe word

[19:57] <timotimo> dalek doesn't suffer from throttling, it suffers from not throttling :)

[19:58] <moritz> mst: a safe *word* might be... insufficient when doing breath play

[19:58] <mst> moritz++

[19:59] <timotimo> a safe-HTTP-request

[19:59] <timotimo> REST PUT air back in my lungs

[20:01] <timotimo> moritz: if you have access to rakudo/rakudo and rakudo/star on github, you could adjust the webhook for those, too

[20:01] <timotimo> travis also wants to report here, then

[20:01] <moritz> timotimo: are we switching over *now*?

[20:02] <timotimo> um, well, nqp/nqp at least is reporting here

[20:02] <moritz> mst: please add http://irclog.perlgeek.de/per6-dev/today to the topic

[20:02] <moritz> and yes, it's a 404 right now, but it won't for long

[20:02] <mst> moritz: /msg chanserv op #perl6-dev

[20:03] <mst> I made TimToady, jnthn, masak co-founders with me, then gave you every permission except full founder, since it only allows four

[20:03] <mst> I figured that mirrored #p6dev as close as possible

[20:04] <moritz> +1

[20:04] <moritz> rakudo/rakudo switched over

[20:04] <mst> (and this is why when you want to set a channel up you should make me help in the first place, I'm good at this sort of donkey work ;)

[20:05] <moritz> rakudo/star too

[20:05] <mst> \o/

[20:05] <moritz> turns out rakudo/star still reported to #perl6

[20:06] <timotimo> maybe we want that. or maybe we want it to report to #perl6-release only?

[20:06] <moritz> do we even need #perl6-release, now that we have #perl6-dev?

[20:07] <timotimo> my thoughts on that are: by having the talk about releases close by in the back log, it's much easier to see what was relevant last time

[20:08] <mst> we may not need it but it might be useful still

[20:08] <mst> if it turns out not to be, what'll likely happen is it'll atrophy of its own accord

[20:08] <mst> and we can do "last one out turns off the lights" when it's already evident that's happened

[20:09] <mst> for the moment, "if it ain't broke, for gods sake don't let the junior developer try to 'fix' it" applies :D

[20:09] <mst> &

[20:35] <nine> May as well join while the thing's still fresh...

[20:40] <cognominal> testing if this appears in the irclog

[20:40] <cognominal> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/   --> no such channel

[20:42] <timotimo> strange

[20:42] <timotimo> moritz said "soon"

[20:48] <cognominal> he probably missed some trivial step

[21:39] <RabidGravy> there

[21:40] <timotimo> o/
