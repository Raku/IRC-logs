[07:10] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev

[09:16] <[Tux]> Yesterday (I had to run before I could post)

[09:16] <[Tux]> This is Rakudo version 2016.05 built on MoarVM version 2016.05

[09:16] <[Tux]> test            19.712

[09:16] <[Tux]> test-t          12.838

[09:16] <[Tux]> csv-parser      33.923

[09:16] <[Tux]> Today:

[09:16] <[Tux]> This is Rakudo version 2016.05-4-g7a4ca4d built on MoarVM version 2016.05

[09:16] <[Tux]> test            19.758

[09:16] <[Tux]> test-t          12.922

[09:16] <[Tux]> csv-parser      33.684

[09:17] <RabidGravy> better than the 14 or so the other week :)

[09:18] <[Tux]> indeed

[12:43] <RabidGravy> If anyone has a work-around for https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128211 I'd be very happy

[12:45] <timotimo> RabidGravy: the BUILDPLAN generator grabs the exact submethod; perhaps it doesn't understand multi submethods and ends up taking one of the candidates instead of the multi, and that screws things up badly?

[12:48] <RabidGravy> it's fine if the class BUILD doesn't have any parameters I think

[13:17] <RabidGravy> actually no, it doesn't make any difference

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: what's the right way to delete spam on RT? It looks like just deleting the ticket is not what should be done

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: or that's what this ｢S｣ button is for?

[16:13] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I am talking about #128212 btw

[16:19] <bartolin> AlexDaniel: I don't "delete" spam tickets, but click on that "S" button instead. If you reload the page afterwards, you see that the ticket is also deleted.

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> /o\

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> I've just clicked the S button and it reopened the ticket /o\

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> /o\

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> and now I cannot delete it /o\

[16:21] <bartolin> hmm, can you mark it as [S]pam again?

[16:21] <AlexDaniel> unmarked, marked again, and yeah! It worked

[16:22] <AlexDaniel> bartolin: thanks! OK, I'll use the ｢S｣ button next time.

[16:22] <bartolin> yw

[16:54] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: yes, press the big red S.

[16:54] <[Coke]> bartolin++ AlexDaniel++

[19:21] <AlexDaniel> what's the right way to run the whole test suite? I have a bunch of fudged files, now what?

[19:21] <timotimo> usually you'll just "env TEST_JOBS=4 make m-spectest"

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: what is m-spectest?

[19:23] <timotimo> spec tests for the moar rakudo

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ah, that's what you are supposed to run from rakudo itself, right?

[19:24] <timotimo> there's also just spectest

[19:24] <timotimo> yeah

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> um, I have a local modified version of roast, how can I tell it to use that?

[19:28] <timotimo> just have it inside t/spec

[19:56] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ok, I'll try that. Thank you

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> I have a patch that removes all trailing whitespace in roast (except for cases when trailing whitespace is part of the test). Does anybody have anything against it?

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> because it touches almost every file in roast

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> by the way, travis-ci is screaming its lungs out on #p6dev

[23:40] <[Coke]> hoelzro++ for getting the release out
