[12:26] <pmurias> [Coke]: I have a horribly hacked local way of building rakudo-js (which involves symlinking node_modules, nqp-bootstrapped.js in rakudo to those files in nqp-js),

[12:28] <pmurias> [Coke]: I'll work on getting something that builds withought such disgusting measures after I figure out the current serialization bug (which makes things fall apart when serializing container specs)

[12:42] <psch> aww, nqp commit 61b3f00 spoils the surprise at seeing a clean nqp make test :)

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Use say for listing tarball contents

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom:

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: This one-liner to build our release tarballs was recently changed from using

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Perl 5 to Perl 6; however, since Perl 6 autochomps unlike Perl 5,

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: the newlines are not preserved when we print(), causing the list of

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: filenames to run together.  We can use say() to emit newline after each

[12:42] <dalek> rakudo/nom: file to fix this.

[13:10] <pmurias> psch: sorry for breaking make j-test :/

[13:11] <psch> pmurias: eh, tests that didn't exists before failing is better than not having them :)

[13:23] <dalek> nqp: 03904fd | peschwa++ | src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/runtime/Ops.java:

[13:23] <dalek> nqp: Fix hinted getattr to correctly deal with native_j.

[13:23] <dalek> nqp:

[13:23] <dalek> nqp: Previously this solution was only implemented for the unhinted attribute

[13:23] <dalek> nqp: access, which clearly is suboptimal.

[13:29] <[Coke]> pmurias: thanks

[14:16] <psch> curious.  with the bigint serialization (well, and everything else since whatever NQP_REVISION is at) i get a new failure mode for install-core-dist.pl

[14:17] <psch> that is, a java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException

[14:23] <psch> hm, still during NativeCall precomp

[14:23] <moritz> .oO( the knight who said nio )

[14:24] <psch> the missing file apparently is the one with the json that describes the CORE distribution..?

[14:24] <psch> which would be rather weird, i can't help but think :)

[14:25] <psch> also, this isn't helped by the fact that we're apparently throwing a lot of that kind of Exception, presumably during the jvm stat ops :/

[14:47] <|Tux|> http://tux.nl/Talks/CSV6/speed5.html now includes first perlito speed

[16:27] <dalek> nqp: 9dead8a | (Pawel Murias)++ | src/vm/js/nqp-runtime/serialization.js:

[16:27] <dalek> nqp:

[16:27] <dalek> nqp: This caused problems with serializing containers and other weird problems.

[16:27] <pmurias> ^^ loads of time wasted debuging that one
