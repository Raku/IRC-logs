[08:31] <nine> Good morning!

[08:31] <yoleaux2> 18 Jun 2016 23:33Z <Zoffix> nine: would you have any idea how to fix this issue? It happens when DESTDIR is specified for make install and it's blocking the release: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2016-06-18#i_12690874

[08:32] <nine> Of course I cannot reproduce that here :/

[10:35] <FROGGS> o/

[10:35] <Zoffix> nine, even when you're using DESTDIR?

[10:35] <nine> Ok, I can reproduce it now when trying to create packages for openSUSE. The difference may already give a hint to what's going wrong.

[10:36] <Zoffix> make install works for me just fine, but make DESTDIR='wblahg' install fails. Where dest dir is absolute version for ../perl

[10:37] <nine> Zoffix: I've tried make DESTDIR/tmp/try1 install from my development directory and it went just fine. I even reconfigured with --prefix and it succeeded. I can only reproduce it with rpmbuild

[10:38] <Zoffix> damn

[10:39] <nine> The relative sources path is a bit strange. It should either be prefixed by a repo name (like perl#/sources/...) or be an absolute path.

[11:04] <nine> Good news is that I may have a patch that fixes this. Bad news is that NativeCall tests fail when I build the rakudo package

[13:35] <MasterDuke> re http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-06-19#i_12692803, the link points to http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/rakudo-star-2016.04.dmg, but the actual filename is rakudo-star-2016-04.dmg

[13:36] <MasterDuke> the filename seems to be wrong, all the other filenames (older versions, different types) in that directory have <year>.<month>

[13:52] <MasterDuke> switching topics entirely, why is 'my @l = <path/to/file>.IO.lines' in perl 6 so much slower than 'open(my $F, "<", <path/to/file>); my @l = <$F>; chomp @l' in perl 5?

[13:53] <lizmat> MasterDuke: we ensure it's valid UTF-8 for one

[13:54] <stmuk> MasterDuke: I'm just fixed that

[13:54] <stmuk> I need new glasses :(

[13:54] <mst> MasterDuke: the general answer to such questions will tend to be

[13:55] <mst> MasterDuke: (1) because perl6 is doing something more clever with a good reason, and there'll be a low level thing you can call to get something more like the perl5 behaviour

[13:55] <mst> MasterDuke: (2) because in the run up to freezing for christmas, perl6 focused on optimizability over optimizations, since the former need to be baked into the feature set and then the latter can be added over time

[13:58] <MasterDuke> looking at a profile, all the time seems to be in IO::Handle.get, which is pretty simple

[13:58] <MasterDuke> and would lead me to believe any improvement in speed would have to come at the MoarVM level?

[14:00] <mst> when I say perl6 I mean rakudo/nqp/MoarVM

[14:00] <mst> somebody with more clue can give you a more detailed answer

[14:02] <Zoffix> It's weird make DESTDIR='blahg' doesn

[14:02] <MasterDuke> fyi, i'm not intending to criticize (i realize perl 6 hasn't had the same # of years to optimize), just find out if it's something i could attemp to work on

[14:02] <Zoffix> It's weird make DESTDIR='blahg' doesn't install moar too.

[14:03] <MasterDuke> and further down the rakudo->nqp->moarvm chain the less i'm able to do so

[14:13] <mst> MasterDuke: yar, I was more trying to set expectations than anything

[14:13] <mst> also it's entirely possible that digging down with profilers even if you can't make the optimisation would help somebody else

[14:16] <MasterDuke> i must say, i absolutely love that a profiler is built in

[14:16] <Zoffix> All this stresstesting makes me wish I had a meatier box :(

[14:16] <MasterDuke> i find myself profiling everything

[14:16] * Zoffix drolls over http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/category/guidedSearch.asp?CatId=22&sel=Detail%3B112_1258_125488_125488

[14:17] <Zoffix> drools too

[14:18] <MasterDuke> same here. i'm starting to find 8gb ram a bit limiting

[14:19] <Zoffix> I have 16GB and I find it limiting ATM (trying to run two VMs at the same time)

[14:19] <MasterDuke> i use some 40 core, 378gb ram machines at $dayjob, would love to have one at home

[14:19] <Zoffix> :o

[14:21] <Zoffix> For CAD$1,625.90 I can build a 6-core (12 threads) + 128GB RAM box. Which isn't too bad

[14:24] <MasterDuke> i'm torn. i want to upgrade my cpu/ram/mb, i want a high dpi monitor, i want an htc vive, i want a new snowboard

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> 128 GB RAM hmmm

[14:24] <MasterDuke> oh, also video card

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> sounds great

[14:24] <MasterDuke> i can do one, maybe two of those

[14:24] <MasterDuke> but which!?

[14:25] <AlexDaniel> you don't really need a drive with such setup :)

[14:25] <mst> at the point where I'm planning to do lots of CPU heavy stuff I think I'll spin up temporary cloud instances

[14:25] <mst> I'd only build a bigass home box if I needed the I/O

[14:27] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: some weeks ago I've switched from 3GB to 6GB RAM :) it's kinda nice that I don't have to unswap things when stuff goes wrong

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> the reason is that I usually run CPU/memory intensive stuff on my server (where bisectable is running)

[14:29] <Zoffix> What's GCE

[14:30] <mst> google compute engine

[14:30] <Zoffix> Cool.. Will look into that if I'm ever releasing rakudo again :)

[14:31] <mst> at some point I'm going to rig something up that lets me spin one of those up for build work

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> not a 12-core but if you want to shell out some money perhaps it makes sense to get a better dedicated server, hm

[14:58] <b2gills> There is also Digital Ocean for virtual servers

[14:58] <mst> yeah, DO are most cool too

[15:29] <Woodi> how vCPUs compare to CPUs ? :)

[15:33] <moritz> they are more elastic :-)

[15:38] <mst> depends on whether you have noisy neighbours or not, generally

[15:40] <moritz> I guess we are the noisy neighbours around here :-)

[15:42] <Woodi> btw. do you compile things on disk or in ram ?

[15:43] <moritz> on disk

[15:43] <moritz> but the buffer cache means it stays in ram at first

[15:44] <moritz> well, it's compiled in ram, then written to disk, but the OS caches the disk write in RAM

[15:44] <moritz> full circle

[15:49] <nine> Zoffix: did my patch fix the DESTDIR issue for you?

[15:50] <Zoffix> nine, yup

[15:50] <Zoffix> nine++

[15:51] <Zoffix> Do you mean an rpm package? <nine> [...] Bad news is that NativeCall tests fail when I build the rakudo package

[15:53] <nine> Zoffix: yes

[15:54] <Zoffix> I'll mention that possibility in the announcement, but I think we can still release.

[15:54] * Zoffix is running the last stresstest on unpacked tar

[15:56] <nine> Zoffix: note that while make test failed during rpmbuild, I can use the installed rpm to install and run panda and Inline::Perl5

[17:20] <Zoffix> errr

[17:20] <Zoffix> Someone needs to run this too:     git tag -u <your-email> -s -a -m "tag release #100" 2016.06; git push --tags

[17:20] <Zoffix> :)

[17:21] <lizmat> my email, or yours ?

[17:21] <Zoffix> lizmat, yours :)

[17:22] <lizmat> well, then I don't need to specify that, do I  ?

[17:22] <Zoffix> Oh, I guess not

[17:22] * Zoffix just copy-pasted from the release guide

[17:22] <lizmat> argh, I don't have gpg

[17:22] <lizmat> so someone else needs to do it...

[17:29] <lizmat> FROGGS: could you tag the release ?

[18:31] <lizmat> in the future, hopefully not  :-)

[18:31] <timotimo> yay

[18:50] <Zoffix> Works. Thanks, moritz++

[18:52] <jnthn> lizmat: btw, getting the return changes ported to JVM took more time than expected, so didn't get to look into nameds and multi-caching just yet.

[18:52] <jnthn> Plan to look in the next few days, as well as start looking into hyper/race
