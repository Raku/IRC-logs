[02:06] <japhb> .tell jnthn Created a new OO::Monitors issue (#8) ... monitor methods swallow ad hoc exceptions and throw a 'Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)' error instead.

[02:06] <yoleaux2> japhb: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[02:49] <gfldex> RT#129984 can be closed, it's properly doced with https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/144a3a92ce

[02:56] <viki> done

[04:06] <japhb> .tell jnthn Went on a golfing spree from a different angle trying to figure out the underlying bug that was catching up OO::Monitors; results added to issue #8 and are humerously insane.

[04:06] <yoleaux2> japhb: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[04:06] <japhb> also humorously

[06:32] <lizmat> Files=1150, Tests=53694, 218 wallclock secs (13.16 usr  3.94 sys + 1343.61 cusr 114.80 csys = 1475.51 CPU)

[08:07] <stmuk_> did anyone test the R* 2016.10.1 Mac rebuild on 10.12?

[08:10] * lizmat must admit she's still on 10.10

[08:11] <stmuk_> 10.12 seems exactly the same as 10.11 apart from the annoying xcode/clang issues

[08:11] * lizmat waits for her next MBP to upgrade

[08:12] <stmuk_> not a vim user then ;)

[08:13] <lizmat> well, for one, going to test the ESC on touchbar issue

[08:13] <lizmat> if I don't like it, I'll remap CAPS-LOCK to ESC

[08:13] <lizmat> should be pretty easy to get used to that

[08:14] <stmuk_> I'm waiting to see if the key travel is better than the MB

[12:19] <MasterDuke> that branch kept growing and growing, eventually i had to stop and just make a PR for what had been done already. there's more that can be done, but that was the easier stuff

[12:21] <FROGGS_> MasterDuke++

[12:24] <MasterDuke> ha, we'll see. it passed spectests, but i admit i don't fully understand all the changes

[12:26] <MasterDuke> and it started out as yak shaving to get to a fix for RT #77070

[12:28] <lizmat> MasterDuke: I didn't check JVM before I merged, but the first build failed  :-(

[14:31] * lizmat argh, found a bug that disappears with spesh disabled

[14:31] <lizmat> it involves canonpath and my current directory

[14:33] <lizmat> hmmm..   and a programming on my side  :-(

[14:36] <MasterDuke> are there any plans for how to implement uniprop on the jvm? would it likely involve bringing in the ICU4J library?

[14:37] <timotimo> i think we'll build a java output mode for our unicode database

[14:41] <timotimo> tony-o: would you mind kicking perl6-json-faster off of github? :)

[14:42] <MasterDuke> timotimo: where is that database?

[14:42] <timotimo> inside moarvm

[14:42] <timotimo> src/unicode and tools/cdc2c or what it's called
