[12:07] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[12:08] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I guess we will be able to release soon, but currently I'm looking at some weird issue in whateverable

[12:08] <AlexDaniel> which may be related to moarvm

[12:17] <brrt> AlexDaniel: keep us informed

[12:18] <nine> Just for the record: I now understand what the issues with CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry were and can confirm that the merged commits are indeed a correct fix.

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> just in case anyone is interested to know what I'm seeing exactly, these bots have a bunch of tests for them, and both bisectable and evalable (maybe others too) can't go through the whole test file because they just stop answering at some seemingly random test. It was working on 2018.05

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> the process is still alive, so it's not a segfault

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> but anyway, looking at it now

[12:51] *** cognominal left

[12:54] <MasterDuke> maybe i'm just reading it wrong, but there appear to be several typos/errors in https://docs.perl6.org/routine/bless, in the 4th paragraph (starting with "However, in general, ...")

[12:56] <MasterDuke> e.g., should it be "might *not* be"? and "if it's documented" (removing the "not")?

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: yeah, ‚Äúif it's documented‚Äù makes more sense. But the first part is correct I think

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: it suggests not to write your own `new` method and instead rely on default stuff

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I guess it should also recommend TWEAK there

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> gah‚Ä¶ and for some reason can't reproduce it locally :S

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> well, I guess I can try this‚Ä¶

[15:01] <AlexDaniel> so it is related to something else, I guess‚Ä¶
