[01:47] <[Coke]> zoffix++ review, awesome!

[01:58] <japhb> CONGRATS, ZOFFIX!

[02:05] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix++ you are awesome

[02:05] <yoleaux> 14 Oct 2018 19:22Z <Zoffix_> AlexDaniel: can you describe the process for tagging in a branch and then merging it to master? Basically, I'm approaching a point where I want to split 6.d spec into a branch and then do finishing touches there, then tag it with 6.d tag and then merge it to master. Any idea what the git commands are? I don't wanna mess it up.

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: so it's actually relatively simple except for one detail. You tag normally (e.g. the way the release guide says, or whatever), tags are ok to be on non-master branches so at that point there's nothing to mess up. When merging there's one small thingie – “direction” of the merge. See this SO answer for details: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45973607/2698019

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: Now, if you checkout `master` and merge another branch into it, then it's simple – `git checkout master; git merge another-branch` and that's it. The diff will look as if your branch changes landed on top of whatever was there in master. I don't do that for rakudo releases.

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: Instead I want it to look as if changes on `master` landed on top of the release (which makes more sense IMO). So `git checkout another-branch; git merge master`. However, now you end up with no merge commit (and other commits) on master, because we just committed a merge into another branch. So we should bring that stuff back into master: `git checkout master; git merge another-branch`. It sees that there are no additional

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> merge commits needed so it fast-forwards (and there are flags to ensure that, but we kinda know what's going to happen).

[02:20] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: whether you should worry about it or not depends on how you want tools to behave, but it's really just a tiny detail and IMO either way is fine and there's not much to mess up.

[02:23] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: do we have a release guide for roast? I don't see it. Maybe we should? Checklists generally help

[02:23] <AlexDaniel> or maybe skip the documentation and write automation directly

[02:24] <AlexDaniel> given how often language releases happen maybe it doesn't need to be automated. I'm just throwing out some thoughts :)

[02:26] <AlexDaniel> .tell Zoffix is your bot still working? In other words, do you receive messages without .tell? Anyway: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-10-15#l62 . Let me know if there's anything else I can help with, I feel like I didn't answer your question but I really don't do anything special

[02:26] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[02:28] *** Zoffix joined
[02:28] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[02:28] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel++

[02:28] <Zoffix> Yes, my bot still works.

[02:28] <Zoffix> Thanks for the description

[02:28] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: oh yeah, after that I remove the branch completely, and never even push it. Do you plan to keep the branch on roast available?

[02:29] <Zoffix> I wasn't gonna, but I see there is a 6.c branch, so I guess yeah, I'm gonna keep it

[02:32] <AlexDaniel> what's the point of that branch, actually

[02:32] <AlexDaniel> it has 12 commits in it

[02:33] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: it's possible that we didn't have v6.c-errata branch at that point so people pushed something there?

[02:34] <AlexDaniel> so basically right now we have both “6.c” and “6.c-errata” branching out from a commit that was tagged “6.c”

[02:34] <AlexDaniel> confusing.

[02:34] <[Coke]> yup, that's probably my fault. 

[02:34] <Zoffix> Yeah, I didn't expect a 6.c branch. I would've thought master is tagged with 6.X and then when first errata occurs, we create 6.X-errata branch

[02:35] <[Coke]> ISTR I suggested we remove the tag at some point (and not use tags for that, only branches), but I don't think it got traction

[02:35] <AlexDaniel> also what the hell would git even do when you say `git checkout 6.c`. Does it prioritize tags or branches?

[02:35] <[Coke]> Having the tag be the first and the branch be the updates is fine; I'm happy if you want to standardize on that.

[02:38] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I'm not strongly suggesting, but more like being curious: why not release more versions of say 6.c from the errata?

[02:38] <AlexDaniel> like 6.c.1 or something

[02:39] <AlexDaniel> I understand that roast is unlikely to be packaged, but if that happens, packagers like stuff to be tagged

[02:40] <AlexDaniel> and generally it makes sense, no? so .c .d .e is a major version, but we can have some minor releases or something like that

[02:41] <Zoffix> Yeah, most of the 6.d spec is non-breaking changes, so going forward, we could make minor releases of stuff like that and keep breaking changes until major verson

[02:42] * Zoffix &

[02:42] *** Zoffix left
[02:43] <[Coke]> the more tagged versions, the more the compiler has to be configured for it. I think that's fine going forward.

[02:44] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: what do you mean? What should be tweaked in the compiler?

[02:50] <[Coke]> use 6.d ; use 6.d.1 ; use ...

[02:51] <[Coke]> also: what does 6.d mean? the tagged release? Probably not, probably the latest 6.d; but then how to get the original 6.d?

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> yes but currently `use v6.c` means, uh… latest 6.c-errata commit? It's a bit LTA

[02:58] <[Coke]> Yup. this would force us to be more strict. I'm not saying that's bad :)

[02:59] <[Coke]> but I think when starting out, we needed that slack more.

[14:17] <lucasb> Hello o/ My thanks to all of you working on P6 :)

[14:17] <lucasb> So 6.d is happening? Before it ships, can I request a little love to a few simple issues:

[14:18] <lucasb> #2131

[14:18] <lucasb> GH #2131

[14:18] <lucasb> GH#2131

[14:18] <synopsebot> GH#2131 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2131 [@LARRY][consistency] Behavior of match occurrence adverbs: :nth(*) and :nth(*-1)

[14:19] <lucasb> and the rename of the json exception class:

[14:19] <lucasb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Rakudo/Internals/JSON.pm6#L1

[14:20] <lucasb> GH#1842

[15:14] <Zoffix> .tell lucasb R#2131 is blocked by R#1289, so it's deferred until 6.e or later. And R#1842 is a Rakudo issue, not a language issue (neither of the classes involved are part of the spec).

[15:14] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to lucasb.

[15:14] <synopsebot> R#1842 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1842 Revert "JSONException -> Rakudo::Internals::JSONException"

[15:17] <Zoffix> .tell lucasb to clarify, R#2131 is blocked by R#1289, because current behaviour is part of 6.c spec ( https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/6.c-errata/S05-modifier/counted.t#L218-L220 ) and any modifications—if agreed on—would have to be behind a language version pragma
