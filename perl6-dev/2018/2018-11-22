[12:37] <AlexDaniel> DrForr: any thoughts on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2499 ?

[12:37] <AlexDaniel> one way to work around is to change `Foo` in tests to unique names

[12:37] <AlexDaniel> but that doesn't feel right

[12:41] <AlexDaniel> I'm actually not sure what that issue bisects to. Once https://github.com/drforr/perl6-Perl6-Parser/pull/17 is merged that'd be easy to figure out, but otherwise I have to do some gymnastics

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> alright, the last one is even weirder I think…

[14:24] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Bad news: running something close to HEAD on a big $dayjob codebase, I get spurious test failures now and then when pieces of it need to be re-compiled. Then run them again and all passes. Not quite sure when exactly it regressed, nor how on earth I can golf it.

[14:25] <jnthn> There's the occasional SEGV, the occasional complaint about get_cache being called on a weird type, and even the odd global merge failed.

[14:25] <jnthn> Seems to never happen if the modules are all compiled

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: I have not seen any big issues during the last run of Blin, but since then there were some commits in MoarVM, maybe something there?

[14:31] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Maybe, I'm not absolutely at HEAD either, that said...

[14:31] <jnthn> I'll compile very latest when I get chance to see if it helps

[14:31] <dogbert21> Perhaps it's the duplicate label problem

[14:31] <jnthn> Also, it's possible that this is not a regression at all, and I just have a large enough codebase combined with 12-degree parallel testing to have exposed an existing issue.

[14:32] <jnthn> I'll try and find out a bit more.

[14:54] <dogbert21> jnthn: do you run your $dayjob system with automatic core dump generation, i.e. ulimit -c unlimited?

[14:54] <dogbert21> perhaps there's a coredump you can take a look at

[15:09] <jnthn> dogbert21: Actually it was a panic, thinking about it, not a core dump

[15:09] <jnthn> But that's by far the rareest of the cases

[15:10] <jnthn> Installing HEAD now before I continue working to see if it happens there or if we're lucky and some fix I didn't have helped it

[15:20] <jnthn> ooh, good news, HEAD seems potentially better...at least, first couple of times changing something deep in the dependency chain and running tests didn't have any spurious failures

[15:21] <jnthn> Maybe it was "[JIT] Fix trunc to cast upwards" that helped...I think we had some other test mis-compiles that were fixed by that

[15:22] <jnthn> I thought I was running with that fix, but apparently not. Sorry for the noise.

[15:28] <AlexDaniel> that makes sense

[15:29] <AlexDaniel> and I still don't understand R#2499
