[19:38] <pmurias> nine: why are we using magic numbers for nqp::write* ops instead of constants?

[19:49] <nine> pmurias: because constants were painfully slow

[19:50] <nine> Need to fix the compiler first to make those actual constants instead of stash lookups

[20:35] <pmurias> nine: you mean at runtime?

[20:40] <pmurias> $qastcomp.as_mast(QAST::IVal.new( :value(%const_map{$op.name}) ) - isn't there something like this in the compiler?

[21:06] <pmurias> nine: or do you mean compiling NQP takes too long?

[21:07] <pmurias> disregard that last question
