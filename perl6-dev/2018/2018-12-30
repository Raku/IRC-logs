[00:55] <timotimo> hm, the other day i meant to check if many of the int arrays we serialize would benefit from something like delta encoding

[00:55] <timotimo> we already have varint encoding, afaik

[00:55] <timotimo> at some point when we were talking about the unicode database or something someone brought up a compression/decompression thing for lists of integers that was supposedly very good

[00:55] <timotimo> was it samcv?

[01:04] <timotimo> just looking at the 'net right now points me at TurboPFor, which has some simd optimizations and such

[18:46] <b2gills> lizmat: Array:D is still a :U. That is to say that while :D form only matches definite things, it isn't itself definite. So `Any:D ~~ Any:D` should return `False` for any value of `Any`

[19:18] <lizmat> b2gills: but that implies you cannot use a List.method(List:D:) signature for a method that can also be called on definite Arrays :-(

[19:20] <lizmat> m: class A { method a(A:D:) { 42 } }; class B is A { }; dd B.new.a   # or does it ?   hmmmm

[23:26] <timotimo> interesting, python has a proposal for getting a ?. syntax

[23:27] <timotimo> not very much like the .? that we have

[23:28] <jnthn> timotimo: What are the proposed semantics?

[23:28] <timotimo> The "None-aware attribute access" operator ?. ("maybe dot") evaluates the complete expression if the left hand side evaluates to a value that is not None

[23:29] <timotimo> they'll also have ?? and ??= for "return lhs if it's not None, otherwise rhs" and ?[] which will only eval a subscript if the lhs is not noen
