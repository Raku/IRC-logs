[00:25] <Zoffix> samcv: that's cause there's an ambiguity: it could mean $date-time - now.DateTime (returning an Int of days) or $date-time.Instant - now (returning Duration object)

[11:16] <pmurias> are the semantics where storing a 2**40+2 into an int32 overflows but storing 2**80 throws dies intentional and wanted?

[11:16] <yoleaux> 05:40Z <Zoffix> pmurias: Are you sure nqp::div_In to make Nums is the right approach? This should be True: use nqp; dd nqp::div_In(99989999999999991, 100_000_000_000_000_000) == nqp::div_In(9998999999999999, 10_000_000_000_000_000);  But it's converting both of those Ints to doubles before doing the division and precision gets busted

[15:17] <Zoffix> pmurias: when I noticed that behaviour last night, I was certain it's a bug. Our goal is to throw on assignment and to overflow on modifications (like $x++). It doesn't make much sense to me that int32 would be overflowing for values <64-bit and throwing for >64-bit values.
