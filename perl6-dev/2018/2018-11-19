[15:04] <jnthn> Well, not snorting it at least :P

[15:05] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: About https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2113, I think since the 6.d spec should let us do this change, then we can Just Do It for this release, provided `use v6.c` is still doing the original semantics.

[15:42] * AlexDaniel makes a PR with `use v6.c` added

[15:42] <jnthn> Yes, that's been a 6.d change (and behind use v6.d.PREVIEW) for months
