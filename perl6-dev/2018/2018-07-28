[12:27] <MasterDuke> now that i've converted nqp to generate *_i math ops instead of *_n, is there some way other than manually inspecting all the code to find where num math was actually expected for operators?

[12:28] <MasterDuke> e.g., $a / $b, if those are ever and always ints, then it's fine. but if they are/could be nums, then it needs to be changed to nqp::div_n($a, $b)

[19:23] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Mention Toaster and say that cancelling is an option sometimes.

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> Added some minimal info to the release guide

[19:34] <AlexDaniel> so “too long; didn't write” for the justification is: cutting from HEAD isn't a great idea because of all the issues; recutting 2018.06 without any commits is just somewhat wasteful; doing 2018.06 + a bunch of cherry-picked changes will require a full-blown release effort with testing which will potentially uncover new issues only happening on the release branch and we better put all that effort into 2018.08

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> stmuk_: ↑ so basically you can wait for 2018.08 or cut from 2018.06

[19:38] <stmuk_> I think I'll use 2018.06 because it would be good to get the Windows fixes out

[19:39] <stmuk_> so probably R* 2018.06 RC tomorrow

[19:40] <AlexDaniel> cool
