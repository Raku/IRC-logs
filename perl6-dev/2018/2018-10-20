[12:17] <tbrowder___> hi, #perl6-dev

[12:19] <tbrowder___> i believe one of the performance imrovement goals is optimizing the grammar

[12:20] <tbrowder___> what about collecting some optimization hints in some kind of grammar regex best practice doc in rakudo docs?

[12:25] <tbrowder___> for instance, yesterday moritz told someone to use a rule instead of a token (when appropriate) for better performane

[12:25] <tbrowder___> s/ane/ance/

[12:27] <moritz> not for performance

[12:27] <moritz> but because non-matching of whitespace caused the whole match to fail

[12:27] <moritz> which a rule would've fixed

[12:28] <tbrowder___> ok, my bad

[12:28] <tbrowder___> but still, are there performance best practices worth listing?

[12:30] <tbrowder___> in my grunt work i see that i have added extra aliases that i’m pretty sure would fractionally help ij i eliminated them

[12:30] <tbrowder___> which i will do

[12:31] <tbrowder___> but larry must have some big ideas on optimization

[16:49] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Details: https://gist.github.com/182174f2867392037a75cbd32125a5cd

[17:31] <Kaiepi> zoffix, can you revert the async socket commits before the next release? i don't quite have enough time to fix the issues with them before then

[17:44] <Kaiepi> .tell Zoffix, can you revert the async socket commits before the next release? i don't quite have enough time to fix the issues with them before then

[17:44] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: What kind of a name is "Zoffix,"?!

[17:44] <Kaiepi> .tell Zoffix can you revert the async socket commits before the next release? i don't quite have enough time to fix the issues with them before then

[17:44] <yoleaux> Kaiepi: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> ahhhh Unicode::GCB is using nqp::getuniprop_int :S

[17:47] <AlexDaniel> hmm but that didn't change…

[18:11] *** MasterDuke left
[18:28] <samcv> AlexDaniel: thanks for the congrats!

[18:28] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I can't figure out what Unicode::GCB is doing, maybe you want to take a look

[18:29] <samcv> ok, sure. what's the issue?

[18:29] <AlexDaniel> samcv: R#2399

[18:29] <synopsebot> R#2399 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2399 [⚠ blocker ⚠] Unicode::GCB failing tests after “Bump NQP to get unicode 11”

[18:29] <AlexDaniel> it's clearly broken but I just don't grasp the code. It's using int values for everything so I just see a bunch of numbers that are different and that's it

[18:29] <samcv> ok i'll clone it and check

[18:30] <AlexDaniel> c: 2018.09,HEAD https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/7324eb8f7d959e81b27dd5b5935d3a66

[18:31] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: good news is that we're just in time for the next Debian release: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBuster

[18:32] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: assuming that we make v6.d happen this year

[18:32] <Zoffix> Kaiepi: AlexDaniel I'm 600km away from home. Maybe AlexDaniel/samcv can just cut from earlier commi

[18:32] <yoleaux> 17:44Z <Kaiepi> Zoffix: can you revert the async socket commits before the next release? i don't quite have enough time to fix the issues with them before then

[18:32] * Zoffix is celebrating legalization :)

[18:33] <Zoffix> Well, after I drive myself home I will

[18:33] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: yeah I'll make sure to do something about it, whether we cut from an earlier commit or not sort of depends on what kind of fixes we get in the next day or two

[18:35] <Kaiepi> thanks

[18:38] <samcv> AlexDaniel: did that work before?

[18:38] <samcv> i'm changing some of the 'ok' tetss to is-deeply/is

[18:38] <samcv>  expected: 3

[18:38] <samcv> #      got: $(Uni.new(0x0061, 0x0308), Uni.new(0x006f, 0x0308), Uni.new(0x0075, 0x0308))

[18:38] <samcv> well there's 3 things in the list... hm

[18:38] <AlexDaniel> samcv: see the output from committable above

[18:38] <samcv> ah ok

[18:39] <AlexDaniel> if there are 3 things in the list your rakudo is too old :)

[18:39] <samcv> maybe

[18:39] <samcv> haha

[18:39] <samcv> ok well

[18:40] <samcv> they are using now discontinued GCB values hm

[18:40] <samcv> err properties and such

[18:40] <samcv> so that could have something to do with it

[18:41] <samcv> MVM_UNICODE_PVALUE_GCB_E_BASE, MVM_UNICODE_PVALUE_GCB_E_BASE_GAZ, MVM_UNICODE_PVALUE_GCB_E_MODIFIER, MVM_UNICODE_PVALUE_GCB_GLUE_AFTER_ZWJ are not in unicode 11

[18:42] <samcv> not sure if that is the reason. but i am rebuilding everything and will check

[19:17] <samcv> AlexDaniel: yeah so that program will have to be changed for Unicode 11 rules

[19:17] <samcv> so i don't think it's our fault that it's broken aside from the unicode version change

[19:22] <AlexDaniel> samcv: yeah, I know
