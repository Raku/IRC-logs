[05:00] <samcv> AlexDaniel, ^^

[05:00] <samcv> my last comment. not what Geth said

[05:06] <samcv> seems to not happen with a clean tree. so maybe there's a file we need to clear hmm

[05:06] <samcv> but at least that makes it much less severe

[09:10] <samcv> should be able to remove blocker status from it. i've added a mitigation https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/999

[19:22] <yoleaux> 17:05Z <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: any plans for next Squashathon?

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: next

[19:23] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in 6 days and ‚âà14 hours (2018-12-03 UTC-12‚åÅUTC+14). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[19:25] <dogbert11> oh it's AlexDaniel

[19:26] <dogbert11> AlexDaniel: could you clarify what the problem is with the Parser module? 

[19:27] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I don't know any moar issue besides that ticket about building on various systems, so you can get the release going

[19:27] <AlexDaniel> once you're satisfied with that ticket of course

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> also I'm back from my 1 full day of w√∂rk :)

[19:29] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: it does not pass tests but I'm pretty sure it used to

[19:29] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: so we broke that module and also broke something else that depends on it

[19:29] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: by the same author, but still

[19:29] <dogbert11> the tests all pass on the commit preceeding 46ef0ea

[19:29] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[19:30] <dogbert11> so the PR you sent only fixes part of the problem?

[19:30] <AlexDaniel> yes

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: documents now have statementlist and lang-version which was introduced here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/46ef0ea08cae96db25c7b5a9543ba696034408c8#diff-d3980092fdbde9a1dd4a30438f8dba19R1348

[19:31] <dogbert11> was the same PR applied to all other modules which were borked by 46ef0ea? (Trying to understand)

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: no, that's the only module that looked at contents of perl6 documents

[19:32] <dogbert11> aha

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> but my PR fixes that, however

[19:32] <dogbert11> but some tests still fail

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> we still get ‚ÄúRedeclaration of symbol 'Foo'‚Äù errors and the like

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> yes

[19:33] <Kaiepi> can someone take a look at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2475 and the related pullreqs? it's been open for a couple weeks now

[19:34] <AlexDaniel> so at that point (even after poking it a bit from time to time) I don't know if it's an issue in the module, or if it's something that we're changing deliberately, or if it's an unintentional regression, or what‚Ä¶

[19:34] <dogbert11> no comments from broken-robot aka IOninja?

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: I don't think they'd be able to tell just from the top of the head

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: is it important before the release, or can it wait after?

[19:36] <Kaiepi> doesn't particularly matter

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: also, there's this option

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> although maybe not fully, but there's something

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> we can release 2018.11 with v6.d support but v6.c by default

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> that makes sense because actually there are many modules broken

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> not too many, but a few

[19:39] <AlexDaniel> I've submitted PRs to all of them, of course, but obviously they're not merged immediately :)

[19:39] <AlexDaniel> a lot of them, at least

[19:40] <AlexDaniel> not saying that it is a good option, but maybe maybe

[19:41] <AlexDaniel> DrForr: are you around? :)

[19:41] <dogbert11> hmm, tricky
