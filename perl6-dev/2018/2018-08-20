[00:30] <AlexDaniel> the reason I do things like HEAD,HEAD,HEAD,HEAD is because it works around single commit timeout of 10 seconds :)

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> and that simply needs this functionality:

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> committable: timeout=50

[00:31] <committable6> AlexDaniel, I cannot recognize this command. See wiki for some examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Committable

[00:32] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: also, toaster itself should deflap and bisect things: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-08-12#l652

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> but honestly I feel like I won't have any time to work on this :(

[00:34] <AlexDaniel> my available free time already goes into releases and stuff, especially when they're hard like this

[00:34] <timotimo> you're always 100% free to reject my dumb spontaneous ideas/outbursts :)

[09:28] <|Tux|> \o/

[09:36] <Ulti> is that test-t --race the parallel version of P6 is now faster than the P5 XS implementation single threaded?

[09:36] <|Tux|> yes, BUT ...

[09:36] <Ulti> there's always a BUT

[09:37] <|Tux|> --race is just possible on CSV files with no embedded newlines anywhere and where the order of the CSV records does not matter

[09:37] <|Tux|> CSV is per definition a stream, which cannot be broken to "lines" and shared amongst processes

[09:38] <Ulti> so --hyper being as fast is the real win I guess

[09:39] <Ulti> I think thats still quite a cool result though plenty of people just want to get through a CSV with records not needing to follow in an order, logs especially you have timestamps to define an order per record anyway

[09:39] <Ulti> that the scheduler is capable of saturating on threading that quickly too

[09:39] <Ulti> assuming the test CSV isnt huge

[09:40] <|Tux|> I spoke to someone doing 30 Tb of CSV a day :)

[09:40] <Ulti> I've noticed that going parallel recently is a lot more profitable than it used to be even on small amounts of data

[09:40] <|Tux|> they used perl5 with a stripped Text::CSV_XS with all I/O layering removed

[09:41] <Ulti> usually I go raw IO for that if its a CSV format I can make some assumptions about

[09:41] <Ulti> which is never true in reality :(

[09:41] <|Tux|> :)

[09:42] <Ulti> but yeah VCF in bioinformatics is essentially a glorified TSV and plenty of places will have TB of those a day they are parsing through

[10:19] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¦2018.06,0990945dc^: «» ¦0990945,HEAD(5ee9afa): « «exit code = 42»»

[10:19] <AlexDaniel> not sure what happened in previous eval but here it's quite clear ↑

[10:21] <jnthn> Right, but I more meant it's worth looking especially for nativecall related commits, if there are any

[10:22] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/compare/2018.06...2018.06-15-g93fdb10

[10:22] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/compare/2018.06-9-gb3ce4f6...2018.06-34-g411f73f

[10:22] * AlexDaniel doesn't see anything obvious

[10:22] <jnthn> No, me either

[10:22] <jnthn> I see lots of JIT expr templates added though

[10:22] <jnthn> Does MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 make the segv go away?

[10:23] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: yes

[10:24] <jnthn> How about MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1 ?

[10:25] <AlexDaniel> segfaults with MVM_JIT_EXPR_DISABLE=1

[10:25] <jnthn> Hm, intreesting

[10:26] <AlexDaniel> git clone https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Audio-Sndfile.git sndfile && cd sndfile && zef install --deps-only . && PERL6LIB=lib/ perl6 t/020-write.t

[10:26] <AlexDaniel> :)

[10:27] <AlexDaniel> or something like that, repro-ing the issue is easy as long as the deps are installed

[11:28] <pmurias> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L2676 - what is the CATCH in try_add_to_sc supposed to catch?

[11:29] <pmurias> it seems to be the only exceptions that can be throw there are cause by the sc we would add stuff to be something invalid

[12:08] <AlexDaniel> nebuchadnezzar: but I hope that p6bannerbot will be decomissioned soon

[12:15] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: are there any spam solutions planned to improve upon it?
