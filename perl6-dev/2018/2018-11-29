[00:39] <timotimo> fwiw, the loop up there mostly runs once or three times, seldomly 2 times and sometimes 7 times during "make install"

[00:39] <timotimo> so the wins don't add up to too much

[00:39] <timotimo> it's also still too big to inline

[11:15] <lucasb> reiterating my question about Failure propagation in the backlog...

[11:16] <lucasb> even docs says: "Calling methods on unhandled failures propagates the failure." https://docs.perl6.org/type/Failure

[11:16] <lizmat> m: Failure.new.foo.bar.baz

[11:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar a0cb89a72: OUTPUT: «Failed␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:18] <lizmat> that's because of the FALLBACK

[11:20] <lizmat> lucasb: /me tries how much will break if FALLBACK just returns self instead of throwing

[11:20] <lucasb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Failure.pm6#L113  <-- like... it's throwing? Was it supposed to?

[11:20] <lizmat> good question

[11:21] <lucasb> m: Failure.new.()

[11:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar a0cb89a72: OUTPUT: «Failed␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:21] <lucasb> ^^ CALL-ME maybe too

[11:22] <lizmat> the throwing is from at least before June 2015

[11:32] <lizmat> hmmm... quite a bit of fails in spectest, mostly in set operator tests (which are quite extensive)

[11:32] <lizmat> so, changing this will require quite a lot of thought, I think

[11:33] <lizmat> afk for a bit&

[12:08] <lucasb> lizmat: thanks for investigating :)

[14:05] <dogbert2_> |Tux| is it your machine which causes your results to fluctuate so wildly?

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> just change it! :)

[14:59] <timotimo> like, one line below it

[14:59] <timotimo> right

[18:40] <AlexDaniel> there's still at least one release in 2018 :)

[18:40] <lucasb> oh, we are still in november, damm!

[18:41] <lucasb> every release is a christmas release
