[00:09] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I think we broke something…

[00:10] <lizmat> Oops, wasn't it supposed to be published yet >

[00:10] <lizmat> ?

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it was published 10 minutes ago, but I think you were editing an older version for some reason

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> which I updated like 15 minutes ago maybe, was fixing < >

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: ok don't touch it for now let me fix it…

[00:10] * lizmat takes her hands off

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> it's unrecoverable… ok let me fix that manually then

[00:15] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: s/it creates it’s own/it creates its own/

[00:16] <AlexDaniel> “recover” feature just doesn't work, it's so frustrating :s

[00:16] <lizmat> :-(

[00:18] <AlexDaniel> fucking crap now it *removed* some text…

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: fixed that s///

[00:20] <lizmat> AlexDaniel++   # also cool article about your work on the bots!

[00:21] * lizmat has done enough damage on this new day so is off to bed

[00:22] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's fine, I'm not sure what happened there

[00:22] <AlexDaniel> but wordpress just likes to eat &lt; &gt;

[00:22] <lizmat> yeah, it does :-(

[00:23] <AlexDaniel> all edits are there, it just ate all the IRC nicknames and stuff

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: thanks!

[00:42] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Great post, and thanks for your excellent work on bisectable and Blin.

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> thank you thank you thank you! :)

[02:34] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: sorry, i was AFK :)

[05:52] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: it's ok! liz did some nice corrections, then I realized that now all &lt; and &gt; are gone, then I was in panic for 10 minutes trying to roll back to a previous version using the broken history feature in wordpress

[05:55] <AlexDaniel> hm, interesting

[05:55] <AlexDaniel> I dared to touch it again, and it &lt; &gt; are gone again

[06:00] <AlexDaniel> pfft alright, no more touching :)

[06:00] <AlexDaniel> fixed it, of course

[08:22] <robertle> AlexDaniel: just read your blog post, great stuff. are all these bots running on a machine in your basement, or is this some sort of hosted/cloud setup?

[10:26] * lizmat has just removed 3.6G of .precomp

[10:27] <lizmat> we'll see tomorrow morning if that made a difference

[10:27] <lizmat> (having removed the files)

[10:27] <lizmat> and then I'll try the patch after that, ok ?

[10:41] <nine> sure

[12:09] <AlexDaniel> robertle: all bots run on a dedicated server, for running Blin I use google compute engine (because more cores)

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> robertle: if you're wondering, security is somewhat an issue. There are some basic protections in place, but someone dedicated will get around easily. Bots don't answer private messages though, somehow people are not very eager to poke bots in a malicious way publicly… so that kinda works

[13:05] <robertle> understood, I was also wondering about resources. is it enough or is the box too small?

[13:11] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: maybe a "panic shutdown" message by a few trusted users could be useful if someone does show up

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> robertle: 21G of free space currently, and the whole data/ dir takes just 49G

[21:38] <AlexDaniel> robertle: that's the beauty of long range compression :) you can give it two or more different (but similar) rakudo builds, and it ends up taking space of roughly one

[21:40] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: I thought about that, yeah. But then, trusted users can also kick users :)

[21:40] <AlexDaniel> maybe not from all channels, but still

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> robertle: regarding R#2564, so it's just a flapper?

[21:53] <synopsebot> R#2564 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2564 "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)" in t/04-nativecall/06-struct.t on mipsel

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> ah, but it's in t/, so that's not cool

[22:30] <robertle> certainly does not happen every time

[22:31] <robertle> I am currently trying to reproduce the third one, ppc64el, but it is surprisingly stubborn

[23:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[23:15] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Cache the generated Distribution to avoid doing directory recursion, as discovered by @niner. It also clears the cache when it finds an existing file that was not discovered during the initial generation of the Distribution. It is debatable if clearing the cache is ideal, but it is the current behavior according to a roast test that fails if caching is added without the clearer.
