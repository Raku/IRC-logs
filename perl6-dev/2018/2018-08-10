[10:02] * timotimo proud

[10:06] <dogbert2> good morning

[10:07] *** perl6nopath joined
[10:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v perl6nopath

[10:07] <jnthn> o/ dogbert2 

[10:07] <dogbert2> hi jnthn, had any coffee yet

[10:08] <jnthn> Yup :)

[10:08] <dogbert2> :)

[10:08] <timotimo> man, i wish coffee tasted as good as it smells

[10:08] <perl6nopath> reboot did solve the problem with PATH, but not the set up problem with Linennoise / editor

[10:09] <timotimo> yes, that's a bug in rakudo that just got fixed about 8 hours ago

[10:09] <dogbert2> so what are you guys up to today, more cool opts perhaps

[10:09] <jnthn> Trying to decide which difficult problem to solve next :)

[10:10] <dogbert2> want an appetizer ? if so try running ./perl6-valgrind-m t/spec/S06-signature/introspection.rakudo.moar

[10:11] <timotimo> say, jnthn, do we want to have an annotation for ops that are fine to re-execute after deopt? like, a bindattr with the same values would be fine to re-do if that lets us put a deopt target earlier in the original code, and maybe that would let us get rid of, for example, the getspeshslot/wval that we sometimes keep around for bindattr's sake

[10:11] <timotimo> like an "idempotent" annotation

[10:12] <jnthn> I was just going to use :pure for that, tbh

[10:12] <jnthn> But actually we keep a lot less getspeshslot/wval around nowadays

[10:12] <timotimo> hm, OK

[10:12] <jnthn> Partly thanks to the better deopt use tracking

[10:12] <timotimo> i thought there's many ops that aren't :pure, but could still benefit from being considered pure for this purpose

[10:12] <jnthn> But yesterday afternoon I added a PHI elimination pass *before* deopt tracking

[10:13] <jnthn> Which let us kick out quite a lot more

[10:13] <timotimo> cool, i didn't pull those changes yet

[10:15] <jnthn> Currently staring at an bonkers guard sequence where it even duplicately guards the same thing

[10:16] <dogbert2> is it https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/inline.c#L1161

[10:16] <timotimo> what is "it"?

[10:17] <lizmat> that shaved off 1056 bytes

[10:17] <jnthn> CORE.setting is shrinking :)

[10:17] <dogbert2> "it" refers to ==7408== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

[10:17] <dogbert2> ==7408==    at 0x41AF2FD: MVM_spesh_inline (inline.c:1161)

[10:18] <dogbert2> from running the instrospection test file

[10:18] <jnthn> How the hell can that be uninitialized...

[10:18] * dogbert2 is innocent :)

[10:19] <jnthn> It's set at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/inline.c#L653

[10:19] <timotimo> i'd kind of expect that to have been allocated from a zeroed block of memory

[10:19] <timotimo> or perhaps the proxy_deopt_idx was the uninitialized thing?

[10:19] <jnthn> Yeah, but it's unconditionally set

[10:19] <jnthn> That ain't involved in the condition though

[10:20] <timotimo> right

[10:20] <timotimo> but who knows what the optimized code looks like :)

[13:37] <Zoffix> buggable: toast

[13:37] <buggable> Zoffix, Between 2018.06-404-g0b3fc07 and 2018.06: 29 (2.58%) modules got burnt; 45 (4.01%) got unsucced; 271 (24.13%) out of 1123 modules appear unusable. See https://toast.perl6.party/ for details.

[13:37] *** pmurias joined
[13:37] <Zoffix> "Type check failed for return value; expected CompUnit::Handle:D but got Nil (Nil)"

[13:38] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[13:38] <Zoffix> .tell AlexDaniel fresh toast: https://toast.perl6.party/

[13:38] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[13:39] <jnthn> *sigh*

[13:39] <jnthn> It's stupid that we allowed that

[13:39] <jnthn> Now we'll be stuck with it

[13:40] <Zoffix> That :D on type constraint allows Nil?

[13:40] *** k6ka22 joined
[13:40] *** k6ka22 left
[13:41] <jnthn> Yes.

[13:41] *** x49F joined
[13:41] <jnthn> If you'd asked me before this week if it did, I'd have said "of course not"

[13:41] <Zoffix> Kinda makes sense IMO. Otherwise you can't `fail` out of :D constraints

[13:41] *** x49F left
[13:41] <jnthn> Yes, that's what the :D would mean

[13:41] <timotimo> an argument could be made that :D means "shouldn't fail"

[13:41] <jnthn> Otherwise it's meaningless

[13:42] <timotimo> does having nil fail the type check blow up any spec tests at all though?

[13:42] <jnthn> Apparently not.

[13:42] <timotimo> so are we *really* stuck with it? :)

[13:42] <jnthn> Otherwise I'd have known about the regression.

[13:43] <Zoffix> No, it's not meaningless. -> --> Int:D { Int } fails type constraint

[13:43] <jnthn> Well, it's like my Proxy returning bug fix.

[13:43] <Zoffix> I don't undertand why it's fine for Failure to bypass all type constraints, EXCEPT the :D.

[13:43] <jnthn> Ecosystem forces us to carry on with it that way

[13:43] <jnthn> Zoffix: We'd kinda counted Nil and Failure as kinds of undefined-ish

[13:44] <jnthn> Anyway, I can't be bothered to argue it

[13:44] <Zoffix> I see

[13:44] <jnthn> A golf would be welcome, as would a spectest

[13:45] <Zoffix> Does the ecosystem really force anything onto us? If even the rakudo's behaviour doesn't define the Perl 6 language, the ecosystem certainly shouldn't.

[13:45] <jnthn> Well, if we just break it then we'll get a reputation we don't want of breaking stuff.

[13:46] <jnthn> So my strategy is to be grumpy here and then patch stuff up to keep working. :P

[14:41] <Ulti> jnthn: for what its worth renaming a method for no reason feels like breaking stuff, suring up semantics of something I might have used without really thinking feels like fixing stuff

[14:41] <Ulti> I have :D in the ecosystem where I sort of chucked out for the sake of it, and I wasnt aware it worked how just described

[14:41] <Ulti> so its not like I was assuming that behaviour

[15:51] <AlexDaniel> anyway, gonna take a look at these failures later this evening

[15:52] <jnthn> Do we know if they were done with MoarVM HEAD or MOAR_REVISION?

[15:53] <jnthn> I fixed a deopt bug last night that was revealed by more PHI pruning (which in turn means more aggressive instruction deletion)

[15:54] <jnthn> And I think the current bump was inbetween the two

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> MOAR_REVISION

[15:55] <jnthn> OK, that may account for some of 'em.

[16:01] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: well, for whomever. I just wanted to notify devs there were some burnt toasts

[16:02] <Zoffix> Won't have the time to look through the failures and file individual tickets myself.

[16:03] <Zoffix> jnthn: I bumped before toasting, so MOAR_REVISION is Moar HEAD ATM
