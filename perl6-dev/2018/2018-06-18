[16:42] <AlexDaniel> err, something not right

[16:42] <hoelzro> (I should clarify that tonight is like 6 hours away for me, if that's an issue)

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> hoelzro: no, I'm opening up master and will release from a branch

[16:43] <hoelzro> ok

[16:43] * AlexDaniel changes the base for that PR

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> basically, I'll do the same I did the last release

[16:51] <AlexDaniel> instead of holding the master branch for a week (cuz things are taking time) I'll just cut it from a release branch

[16:59] <jnthn> AlexDaniel++

[16:59] <jnthn> Though my branch still has a good bit of work to go before merge :)

[20:40] <Zoffix> sure :)

[20:41] <lizmat> okidoki  :-)

[20:41] <notable6> lizmat, Noted!

[20:43] <samcv> jnthn: i was trying to add more coercions to nqp MAST but i'm having issues

[20:44] *** Zoffix left
[20:47] <samcv> this is what i have so far https://github.com/samcv/nqp/blob/coerce_u/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTCompilerMAST.nqp#L521-L531

[20:47] <samcv> first thing works using my new coerce_us op. and the second one trying to coerce from uint32 doesn't work. i really am not sure how to fix it. i just tried to steal code from here https://github.com/samcv/nqp/blob/coerce_u/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTCompilerMAST.nqp#L580-L585

[20:48] <MasterDuke> Zoffix: "sigilles", is that a typo for "sigilless"?

[20:48] <samcv> i'm probably doing something very wrong, but i don't know this code enough to know what

[20:51] <MasterDuke> Zoffix: also, not sure if "pain in the bit" is an intentional pun

[21:04] <MasterDuke> samcv: what happens instead of it working?

[21:04] *** robertle left
[21:04] <samcv> well it segfaults when the resulting "string" is tried to be used in moarvm

[21:04] <samcv> so i'm guessing it's returning an int but labeling it as a string is stored there

[21:04] *** raschipi_ is now known as raschipi

[22:21] <hoelzro> AlexDaniel: just made that fix

[22:21] <hoelzro> if ugexe approves, we can merge that

[22:25] *** brrt left
[22:32] <jnthn> samcv: I don't immediately guess what's wrong just by looking at the code

[22:32] <jnthn> samcv: I'd probably --target=mbc --output=x.moarvm and then run moar --dump x.moarvm to see what code it's resulting in, which will hopefully be revealing

[22:33] <jnthn> We do register kind validation though

[22:33] <jnthn> So "putting an int into a str reg" should in theory be impossible

[22:33] <samcv> hm

[22:34] <jnthn> Of course, the validator is software, so it's possible it has a bug :)

[22:35] <timotimo> jnthn: does it make sense to elide prof_allocated for getspeshslot ops?

[22:35] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, that can never allcolate

[22:35] <jnthn> *allocate

[22:41] <timotimo> good. i thougt sometimes when we have little caches that get put in, that those should perhaps be tracked, but that'd not go on getspeshslot ops, but on sp_blah ops?

[22:44] <jnthn> Yeah, getspeshslot is always just a simple lookup

[22:45] <timotimo> that tells me, though, that we probably want to have a prof_speshallocated for spesh slots that may get populated by ops, like sp_findmeth for example?

[22:49] <jnthn> Oh

[22:49] <jnthn> But those don't allocate, really?

[22:49] <jnthn> They just store existing state

[22:50] <timotimo> OK, that's good, then

[22:50] <timotimo> sorry i didn't look closely enough
