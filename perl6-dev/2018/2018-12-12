[20:21] <jnthn> Well, and methods are in general :)

[20:22] <lucasb> Can you believe ruby devs prefered 'RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree' over 'RubyVM::AST'? :)

[20:22] <lucasb> because longer names discourages casual usage

[20:23] <jnthn> I couldn't be ast with typing that all the time... :P

[20:28] <lucasb> (Just to be clear, my name sugggestion was for the enum: enum Endianness < NativeEndian LittleEndian BigEndian >)

[20:29] <lucasb> (or... EndianType)

[20:32] * nine is glad he didn't pick 3 as the value for BigEndian

[20:37] <pmurias> jnthn: Stash seems good enough

[20:43] <pmurias> jnthn: and what about something that sets $?FILES?

[22:32] <pmurias> lucasb: doesn't RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree have such a lame name because it's something for mostly debugging internal use rather than a proper AST?
