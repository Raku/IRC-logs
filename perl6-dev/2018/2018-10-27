[00:00] <Zoffix> timotimo: yeah, it totally fixed that bug

[00:01] <Zoffix> samcv++

[00:01] <timotimo> that's brilliant!

[00:02] <timotimo> samcv++ indeed

[00:03] <timotimo> maybe what we want is a chaos mode for the jit that just randomly inserts random values into all the float registers every now and then

[00:03] <timotimo> everywhere all over the compiled code

[00:03] <timotimo> oh, wait, sometimes we do want values in the floating point registers

[00:03] <timotimo> m)

[00:15] <Zoffix> So what's the --setting flag for?

[00:15] <Zoffix> Like, why is the 6.c setting passed as NULL instead of 6.c or something?

[00:16] <timotimo> that's the setting that will be used to compile stuff

[00:16] <Zoffix> Ah

[00:16] <Zoffix> OK

[00:28] <timotimo> so, here's a fun

[00:31] <timotimo> add-whenever runs the producer of Supply.from-list under CurrentThreadScheduler

[00:31] <timotimo> and that tries to pull-one

[00:32] <timotimo> which in the case of Supply.from-list($*IN.lines) causes it to block on IO::Handle's READ

[00:33] <timotimo> i have a feeling that's not quite right, but the supply code is very involved and i haven't looked into its guts much yet

[00:34] <timotimo> oh

[00:34] <timotimo> from-list just has the CurrentThreadScheduler as the default scheduler

[00:41] <timotimo> i suppose i could also have used .Channel.Supply, right?

[00:41] *** leont left
[00:41] <timotimo> since supply explicitly doesn't add concurrency by itself

[00:42] <timotimo> we don't have a .Channel method on List nor Seq?

[13:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar e7e91ecfb: OUTPUT: «6.c␤»

[13:19] <Zoffix> jnthn nine ^ should EVAL be defaulting to parent code's language version?

[13:19] <Zoffix> There's a bunch of 6.c roast failing due to this, because stuff like `throws-like ｢...｣` now uses 6.d all of a sudden

[13:21] <Zoffix> I guess that's part of R#1289

[13:21] <synopsebot> R#1289 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1289 [6.e] Implement a Way to Know Caller's Language

[13:22] <jnthn> Well, that example gets to the heart of the problem too, 'cus it's Test that does the EVAL, but the spectest's langauge version is the language we care about.

[13:23] <Zoffix> A "bunch" that fails looks to be just 2 tests; one in t/spec/S04-declarations/constant.t  and one in t/spec/S32-exceptions/misc.t

[13:23] *** cognominal-p6 joined

[13:30] <Zoffix> I'm gonna add `'use v6.c; ` inside `throws-like` code to two 6.c-errata tests. I know the tests technically aren't wrong, but R#1289 ain't a trivial issue and blocking 6.d for another year just due to this IMO is not acceptable. Also, the two tests in question involve throwage in `constant %foo` and another error with :sym<foo> on a sub

[13:30] <synopsebot> R#1289 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1289 [6.e] Implement a Way to Know Caller's Language

[15:29] <Zoffix> quite a bit of roast explodes with 6.d as default lang. Like a screenful of failed test files. I hope that's not an indication of how much ecosystem will blow up :)

[15:31] <nine> timotimo: being able to sort (e.g. by # of calls) would be more useful however :)

[15:32] <timotimo> yes!

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: oh well

[15:33] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel: want to do a tricky bisect?

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: yay, sure

[15:33] <Zoffix> There's probably gonna be a bunch of ecofailures due now-required for version pragma to be first thing in file

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: I've been trying to wake myself up for the last many hours… let's see if this does it :)

[15:35] *** fake_space_whale joined
[15:35] <AlexDaniel> ok that's gonna be a lot of botspam

[15:35] * AlexDaniel moves to #whateverable

[15:35] <dogbert17> follows

[15:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v fake_space_whale

[15:38] <Zoffix> ZOFLOP: t/spec/S17-supply/supplier-preserving.t Parse errors: Bad plan.  You planned 1 tests but ran 0.

[15:39] <Zoffix> hm

[15:39] <Zoffix> No such method 'recv' for invocant of type 'Any'

[15:39] <Zoffix>   in block  at t/spec/S32-io/socket-accept-and-working-threads.t line 53

[15:39] <Zoffix> And that line is just `while my $buf = $conn.recv(:bin) {`... For some reason 6.d default lang messed it up

[15:39] <Zoffix> oh

[15:40] <Zoffix> That's the sunk-start-exception-catcher. And looks like that test was always busted but 6.d `start` detected a bug

[15:41] <Zoffix> or maybe not :) sticking a CATCH into that start in 6.c lang don't catch nothing

[15:42] <Zoffix> my `start` work is crap that's why

[15:42] <Zoffix> m: use v6.d.PREVIEW; my $z; start { $z.abs.say }; sleep 1

[15:55] <AlexDaniel> but whatever, we do know what this will bisect to

[15:56] <Zoffix> Except with debug prints and CATCH added. It dies on 6.d due to handlers on sunk starts

[15:58] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: what tho?

[16:01] <Zoffix> oh, I know what it is. I'm forgetting to migrate stuff

[16:02] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel: I checked out the PR (I think) and built Rakudo. Still fails though. Perhaps I missed something here

[16:02] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: we can revert 6ee5f7577 for release

[16:02] <Zoffix> It's a 6.d-only thing

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I have a question, perhaps stupid

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: but why are we not making `use v6.d` available on 2018.10?

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't have to be on by default, just available

[16:04] <AlexDaniel> or am I misunderstanding something?

[16:04] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: well, revert if you're releasing right now, I'm gonna work on a fix in a $n hours and and it can be cherry picked if I make it in time

[16:04] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: what's the point?

[16:04] <dogbert17> I did 'git fetch origin pull/2425/head:fix_possible_race_proc_asyn' followed by 'git checkout fix_possible_race_proc_asyn'. Then I rebuilt Rakudo

[16:04] <Zoffix> TBH, I want 2018.10 out ASAP. Delaying it to coincide with 6.d Spec release will have a lot of confusion among users.

[16:04] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I can't release without a moarvm release, fwiw

[16:05] <Zoffix> samcv: what's the status of MoarVM release/

[16:05] <Zoffix> ?

[16:05] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: yeah that should've done it

[16:05] <dogbert17> SEGV is still there 

[16:06] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[16:06] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: file a ticket. I don't know if that's a blocker but it's definitely not cool

[16:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[16:07] <dogbert17> will do. fortunately there aren't many people using those flags on a daily basis I think

[16:09] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: in any case, the simple answer is we're not making `use v6.d` available in 2018.10 because there's no 6.d yet

[16:09] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: ah-ha, ok

[16:09] <AlexDaniel> makes sense

[16:10] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: another stupid question: do we need the next rakudo (2018.11) to have v6.d on by default

[16:10] <AlexDaniel> as opposed to having `use v6.d` available but just not default

[16:11] <AlexDaniel> maybe so that we can fix some ecosystem fallout before we switch?

[16:11] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: yeah. That's already the case in `the-d` branch. 

[16:12] <Zoffix> And I'm fixing up 6.d roast to work with such a compiler ATM

[16:13] <Zoffix> And even tho there's no 6.d yet, by the time 2018.11 comes out there will be, and as you said, we're enabling it on dev rakudo to test stuff

[16:16] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/987

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> alright

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> multiple things to be reverted across multiple repos, stuff is confusing

[17:59] <Zoffix> "The nqp-m binary is too old" hmmm :)

[17:59] <Zoffix> ah, I need to pull in other repos

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> argh, no, something is not right

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> no, I forgot to pull also

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> xD

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> tbh I don't even know how to revert multiple commits at once. I don't want a bazillion of revert commits, so I squashed them with rebase

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> so I'm trying to figure out this: https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/jobs/447156275#L1001

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> and, if I get it right, we are here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/d28545d64be63be6107a9534d792221f59aecf88/tools/build/Makefile-JVM.in#L221

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> I looked at git log for related files and I see nothing related to it

[20:25] * Zoffix struggles to find a JVM build that actually succeeded without build crashes

[20:27] <Zoffix> I saw one where it just timed out for taking make test too long

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> so yeah, both DESTDIR and J_LIBPATH are empty

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> J_LIBPATH = 

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> mm

[20:35] <AlexDaniel> ahhhaaa

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> this!

[20:39] <Zoffix> heh

[20:39] * Zoffix doesn't get it o/

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> I don't understand what this commit does, but the fix is easy

[20:41] * AlexDaniel tests locally

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> moritz: `There are now 318 modules in this repo (used to be more around 215 before I fixed stuff).` ?

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> but we have over 1000 in the ecosystem

[20:50] <AlexDaniel> moritz: 979 modules are installable, blin

[20:50] <AlexDaniel> so 318 is ⅓ of success

[20:50] * Zoffix lols at "blin"

[20:51] <AlexDaniel> here's the list of modules that definitely should be in the repo: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/1e91196b1ebd68f60ee7767f0aa5cb96

[20:53] <jnthn> haha :D

[20:54] <moritz> AlexDaniel: I'm just too stupid to count. 1197 by my less stupid estimation :)

[20:54] <jnthn> Zoffix++ # 6.d work

[20:54] <AlexDaniel> moritz: o yey! That makes more sense

[20:54] <AlexDaniel> moritz++

[20:55] <jnthn> Zoffix: So, what happens between now and 2018.11? Is the spectest repo tagged for 6.d, or is there still some time before that?

[20:58] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: ↑ that's it :S

[20:58] <Zoffix> jnthn: no, it's not tagget yet. Still need to change `use v6`/`use v6.d.PREVIEW` to `use v6.d` and (in release branch) remove new exceptions and all fudges that don't have a working implementation on any backend. Then finish off the changelog and I think there will pop up new features that were never specced, so possibly add spec for those and then I believe it will be cut-n-tag worthy
