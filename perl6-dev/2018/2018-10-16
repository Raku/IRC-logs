[16:20] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I have a risky-ish commit for MoarVM (faster Int stringification). Should I do commit to master or to post-release branch for post-release inclusion?

[16:21] <Zoffix> risky-ish: well, I understand well what it's doing and all, but Int stringification is like everywhere, so if it's messed up, then everything's messed up :)

[16:21] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: you can do it now, no toasting was done so far so we will see module fallout if there is any (and IMO there are enough days to spot other obvious issues)

[16:21] <Zoffix> ok

[16:21] <brrt> Zoffix: a branch or PR please, but I don't think we want to make postrelease a thing
