[00:05] <timotimo> i know what you're thinking, but we'll not send out a developer alert asking people to vote in the US midterm elections

[00:06] <AlexDaniel> haha

[00:06] <AlexDaniel> no I was just reading that thread about official channels

[00:07] <timotimo> say

[00:07] <timotimo> where in the spec do we have the tests for Any's "i'll be a single-item list if you need me to" behaviour?

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> that's probably all over the place with no single dedicated file for it

[00:18] <timotimo> i'd have liked to find the apocalypse for it
