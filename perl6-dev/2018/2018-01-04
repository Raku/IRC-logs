[00:42] <AlexDaniel> so wordpress just mailed me saying that I should approve a comment on https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/23/day-23-the-wonders-of-perl6-golf/

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> butâ€¦ I don't have permissions to do so

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> :S

[00:44] <timotimo> i'll approve it for you

[00:45] <timotimo> done

[00:45] <timotimo> https://wordpress.com/comments/all/perl6advent.wordpress.com - AlexDaniel, is there anything you're allowed to do here?

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> yes, I can like things

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> and I can write replies

[00:46] <timotimo> wow, that mail really was super helpful

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> I can also delete my own messages

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> (and mark them as spam)

[00:47] <timotimo> https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/perl_programming_language/ - just seen on twitter

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> hmmm maybe I was allowed to approve it from that page?

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> the link in the email said that I don't have enough permissions

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> but on that page I can unapprove things under my post, I think

[00:52] <timotimo> i hope the fosdem recordings will be better this time around

[00:54] <AlexDaniel> would be great to have recordings, yesâ€¦

[00:55] * AlexDaniel should stop with smirk comments

[00:56] <timotimo> we usually do have recordings, it's just that the volunteers (who i can't praise enough regardless of the audio quality) usually don't have the sufficiently expensive equipment to get good recordings done

[00:56] <timotimo> and why would a semi-random visitor who volunteers to take care of recording because nobody else would have to lay down a few thousand bucks for just that

[00:57] <timotimo> i honestly have no idea what sufficiently good equipment would cost, actually

[00:58] <timotimo> ideally, there'd be a mic on the speaker's upper body/chest/neck or even face, that'd probably improve the quality more than ten fold over a room mic

[00:59] <timotimo> actually, am i totally confusing fosdem with another conference here?

[00:59] <geekosaur> and don

[00:59] <geekosaur> 't forget the overhead cost of such mikes being forgotten or stolen

[00:59] <geekosaur> etc.

[01:14] <timotimo> oh, ugh

[08:16] <El_Che> fosdem video equipment is fine. There is a chest mirror and a good expensive camera on a tripod. The problem is the scale. Everything is pushed to a server through a complex black-box like system including specialized hw and a laptop. And once in a while something goes wrong with the recording (e.g. mic batteries dead) and the person manning the camera does not see it. Of a problem on the receiving end,

[08:16] <El_Che> etc.

[08:17] <El_Che> So, I think the problem is mostly not enough experienced volunteers that know the system

[08:17] <El_Che> but with the size of the thing, that won't happen

[08:18] <El_Che> we seem to be relatively lucky with our videos. We have videos of most talks, but there are always some that are broken

[08:18] <El_Che> (mostly sound)

[08:18] <El_Che> btw, the software to cut and sync the video on scale is written in Perl5

[08:19] <El_Che> it does an impressive job regarding the aforementioned scale (and volume, and parallel editing tasks, etc)

[21:28] <TimToady> got another memory chew on S17-supply/syntax.t

[21:54] * lizmat still regularly sees semi-random test-files fail with messages like: Parse errors: Bad plan.  You planned 29 tests but ran 0.

[21:54] <lizmat> which probably means a segfault before any (buffered) output was ever seen

[21:58] <TimToady> are you running with a ulimit?  I'm not, at the moment...

[22:01] <El_Che> the segfault on repeat.t I and travis have is maybe related to ulimit values higher than what Zoffix has on his VM... (in case we're discussing ulimit :) )

[22:01] <lizmat> TimToady: $ ulimit    # unlimited

[22:01] <lizmat> with 16G of RAM, that should not be an issue

[22:02] <TimToady> lovely word, "should"... :)

[22:03] <gfldex> lizmat: syslog may show if there are segfaults

[22:03] <geekosaur> "ulimit" by itself only tells you the file size limit

[22:03] <geekosaur> "ulimit -a" shows all limits

[22:04] <lizmat> everything unlimitedm, except core file size (0), open files (256), pipe size (1), stack size (8192), max user processes (709)

[22:05] <El_Che> wow, low open file limit

[22:06] <El_Che> low everything actually. It's that a mac thing?

[22:08] <geekosaur> yes

[22:08] <geekosaur> the open files limit in particular is a common OS X gotcha

[22:16] <El_Che> geekosaur: good to know, thx
