[00:44] <Zoffix> I'll take that as a "yes" (QAST::WVal already does it)

[00:45] <Zoffix> oh and QAST::BVal is that too always compile time?

[00:53] <Zoffix> refers to a QAST::Block and *rakes brain* pads are immutable, so yeah should be safe

[01:06] <samcv> Zoffix: i have a potential fix for the randomness issue of .rand

[01:06] <samcv> it's at least 10,000 better than before

[01:06] <samcv> maybe. err actually maybe not

[01:07] <samcv> still seems to have issues with very large ones

[01:07] <Zoffix> But are you sure there's a problem in the first place?

[01:07] <samcv> yeah

[01:08] <Zoffix> What does the fix do?

[01:08] <Zoffix> But there's only 17 sigfigs of precision

[01:08] <samcv> that is pretty unrandom. it's only apparent if you use base(16) though is that also maybe caused by float?

[01:16] <samcv> i'm sure plenty of people use rand just for random integer numbers. and since it's pretty unrandom for large ones we may want to provide a way to use rand_I

[01:28] <samcv> i guess my random generation values are not being random anymore

[01:28] <samcv> testing with this https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/

[01:29] <samcv> getting 5% and 95% alternatng (should be ~50%)

[01:29] <samcv> was getting 45% before. but i guess that's based on how random the random state we keep

[01:37] <Zoffix> I think if you ping something you get more entropy available? sudo ping -f some host

[01:38] <samcv> what? well moarvm's randomness isn't related to the system's randomness

[01:40] <samcv> Zoffix: i think this funcion reseeds the uint64 random https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/3rdparty/tinymt/tinymt64.c#L68

[01:40] <samcv> and this generates the double we use in rand_n https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/3rdparty/tinymt/tinymt64.c#L113

[22:25] <nooninm> Is book wrong or is Rakudo Star version 2018.01 wrong?

[22:25] <timotimo> that's the book being wrong

[22:25] <nooninm> Thanks

[22:25] <timotimo> .WHAT is always supposed to give you the type object, and those will output as the name of the type in parenthesis if you "say" it

[22:25] <nooninm> Bye

[22:25] <timotimo> have a good one!

[22:27] <nooninm> Whoa, wait a sec.  Then the book is right.  say (1,234,567).WHAT should output    "(List)"  because List is the type, right?

[22:27] <nooninm> But instead it outputs the number 1234567

[22:27] <timotimo> oh!

[22:27] <timotimo> i got it the wrong way around

[22:27] <timotimo> sorry, now i see it

[22:27] <timotimo> you need to put a space after the say

[22:28] <timotimo> that is the difference between calling say with the numbers and the ncalling WHAT on what say returns vs calling WHAT no the list and saying what WHAT returns

[22:28] <timotimo> excuse me, it's past midnight here :)

[22:28] <nooninm> The space did the trick.

[22:28] <nooninm> Thanks
