[00:16] <AlexDaniel> hah

[00:17] <jnthn> oh my, it's almost like the type I stopped saying "good morning" because there was a bot that'd sometimes reply "and good moroning to you", but not quite so bad. :-)

[00:18] <japhb> o/

[00:18] <AlexDaniel> I mean, I was testing it… still have a release to cut :)

[00:21] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: I just realized that I actually made a PR to make blocks optional: https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake/commit/9a1f278c1c2939f363865f65d19a7c7c01028756

[00:21] <AlexDaniel> so it's not an issue anymore!

[09:27] <pmurias> .tell brrt the both have a similiar premise: you write an interpreter and then you get a JIT, but they are implemented differently

[09:27] <yoleaux> pmurias: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[09:36] <pmurias> .tell brrt not sure how accurately summarize how truffle works in a few sentences

[10:38] <pmurias> brrt: I like the truffle approach a lot more than pypy

[10:39] <brrt> so... what is the difference

[10:39] <yoleaux> 09:27Z <pmurias> brrt: the both have a similiar premise: you write an interpreter and then you get a JIT, but they are implemented differently

[10:39] <yoleaux> 09:36Z <pmurias> brrt: not sure how accurately summarize how truffle works in a few sentences

[10:39] <brrt> :-)

[10:39] <brrt> heh, i can take a loop

[10:39] <brrt> *look

[10:40] <pmurias> brrt: in truffle you write an AST interpreter, and then the JIT works by turning some AST nodes into the code the interpreter would execute for them

[10:41] <pmurias> with extra steps to make stuff faster ;)

[10:42] <pmurias> while as far as I remember pypy JITs you interpreter so hard that the program it jits ends up being jited

[11:14] <brrt> i see

[11:23] <pmurias> it runs Ruby and JavaScript super fast so I'm hoping it will work for Perl 6 too

[12:08] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: hello, undersightable6 just told me that there's an issue with https on https://perlfoundation.org

[12:09] <AlexDaniel> I think previously it was working properly

[12:09] <AlexDaniel> samcv: also “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoarVM 	200 	☠ No mention of 2018.06 release found”

[12:13] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: also, can I please have admin access to https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake ? Yesterday perlpilot moved it to perl6/ org with an idea that I'd maintain it at first, and I'd like to have access to webhooks and stuff

[12:14] *** lizmat left
[12:15] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: or maybe you can set up “Default repository permissions” so that team “core” always has admin access

[12:15] <AlexDaniel> ( https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/core/members )

[12:18] *** cygx left
[12:28] *** Zoffix joined
[12:28] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I made you org admin, so you should have access.

[12:30] <Zoffix> also, there's "core" and "Org-Admins" groups, so presumably "core" doesn't need org admin perms added

[12:32] *** Ven` joined
[12:34] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I guess so. In fact what I was trying to say is probably impossible

[12:34] *** perlpilot joined
[12:34] *** Ven`` left
[12:36] <AlexDaniel> in fact, now I realize I could've asked perlpilot to give the perms :) Anyway, thanks!

[12:59] <stmuk> we haven't built on OpenBSD since March https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/878

[13:12] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: interesting. What about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1867 ?

[13:12] <AlexDaniel> in the comments people are saying that some tests are failing, but then I guess it builds for them?

[13:19] <stmuk> AlexDaniel: that's strange since I wouldn't have expected Kaiepi's version to work but he does mention using a different libuv

[13:20] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: it seems like different libuv is only needed to fix IPv6 issue, and it should build fine either way

[13:20] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: ping ↑

[13:22] <stmuk> its also possible the problem is with recent OpenBSD patches like https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.3/common/010_intelfpu.patch.sig

[13:29] <Kaiepi> nqp still builds for me

[13:30] <stmuk> do you have the intelfpu patch?

[13:35] *** lizmat joined
[13:36] *** Ven` left
[13:44] <Kaiepi> yeah i do

[13:45] <stmuk> yes I saw the thread

[13:46] <stmuk> was wondering about any resource limit tweaks (ulimit, login class etc.)?

[13:48] <Kaiepi> i have datasize-max and datasize-cur for the default login upped to 4G trying to fix a different issue i was having with nqp, but apart from that none

[13:49] <Kaiepi> try building it with --moar-option=--has-libuv with libuv built from ports

[14:01] <Kaiepi> ok wtf moar panics on launch when i build without --has-dyncall

[14:02] <Kaiepi> that's new

[14:03] <brrt> hmm, panics with what?

[14:03] <stmuk> --has-libuv passed to Moar's configure breaks cc probe

[14:04] <stmuk> note I'm using the old gcc not clang

[14:05] <Kaiepi> i'm using egcc

[14:06] <Kaiepi> still panics without --has-libuv

[14:07] <Kaiepi> i checked if the updates to dyncall broke anything, but that doesn't seem to be the case

[14:07] <stmuk> egcc is gcc 4.9.4 from ports?

[14:08] <stmuk> can you reproduce my issue with the standard gcc 4.2.1?

[14:08] <Kaiepi> yep

[14:09] <Kaiepi> i'll give it a shot

[14:13] <Kaiepi> stmuk yep, same error

[14:14] <Kaiepi> also i remembered why i needed --has-dyncall to run moar at all, i forgot /home wasn't mounted with uxallowed

[14:20] *** Ven`` joined
[14:21] <stmuk> I'm trying clang (which also ships as standard)

[14:36] *** lizmat left
[14:38] <stmuk> which works

[14:40] <Kaiepi> maybe the configure script should be using clang by default for openbsd instead of gcc

[14:42] <stmuk> yes I think it should and probably add --has-dyncall too 

[14:42] <Kaiepi> only problem is dyncall isn't available through pkg or ports

[14:46] <stmuk> ah damm

[22:48] <cog> I thought one could omit the comma without unexpected effect

[22:50] <cog> I note btw that Perl 6 is shy accepting omitting the comma after anything that cannot be interpreted as a-function-name-of-a-call. Why only adverbs ? But that is a separate issue
