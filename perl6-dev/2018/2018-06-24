[14:17] <dogbert17> .seen lizmat

[14:17] <yoleaux> I saw lizmat 05:59Z in #perl6: <lizmat> .seen supernovus

[14:17] <lizmat> you rang ?

[14:17] <dogbert17> yes, time for a question?

[14:17] <lizmat> sure

[14:17] * lizmat is just awake in SLC 

[14:18] <dogbert17> this roast file tries to 'force' a gc in a suspect manner: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S12-construction/destruction.t#L35

[14:18] <dogbert17> would it be ok to use nqp here, i.e. force:gc

[14:18] <dogbert17> *force_gc

[14:19] <dogbert17> two of the four tests will pass if a gc actually occurs

[14:20] *** hankache joined
[14:21] <dogbert17> perhaps you need to fix a ENOCOFFEE before answering :)

[14:22] <lizmat> sorry, was distracted here

[14:23] <dogbert17> np

[14:23] <lizmat> there's nor a lot of nqp in roast atm

[14:23] <lizmat> mostly mentioned in comments

[14:24] <dogbert17> true

[14:24] <lizmat> if a test is really testing garbage collection behaviour, maybe it should not live in roast ?

[14:25] <dogbert17> where else?

[14:27] <lizmat> in t/08-performance.t maybe ?

[14:29] <lizmat> or maybe a new t/11-gc.t ?

[14:30] <dogbert17> do you know of an alternative way to test that submethod DESTROY works as intended. besides making a gc happen?

[14:35] <lizmat> no

[14:35] <lizmat> that's the only way

[14:35] <lizmat> afaik  :-)

[14:37] <dogbert17> so, we can move it to the rakudo repo, if I understand you correctly, or 'use nqp' which might not be the best solution since it's isn't used anywhere else in roast

[14:46] * dogbert17 is sorely tempted to 'use nqp' :)

[14:54] <lizmat> dogbert17: "nqp" is not part of Perl 6

[14:55] *** skids joined
[14:57] <dogbert17> true true

[14:58] <timotimo> we could have a fudge directive that emits an nqp::force_gc on rakudo and such, and otherwise "encourage" gc with other means

[15:06] <dogbert17> as it is now I'd say that the tests are a bit brittle/flappy

[15:10] <pmurias> please don't put GC behavior specific tests in roast

[15:11] <pmurias> timotimo: how are you going to enforce gc on platforms that don't provide that?

[15:12] <timotimo> don't ask me difficult questions like that at ... 5pm in the morning ...

[15:13] <dogbert17> pmurias: I won't

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> there's an interesting doing in #perl6

[15:15] <AlexDaniel> here's a list of editable questions for the upcoming perl 6 survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19qSBpGWWc9RNruxPWySHkmy3tppaqeqUNGfZpHhdsMs/edit?usp=sharing

[15:31] <lizmat> s:g/Perl6/Perl 6/

[15:32] <lizmat> "How did you install Perl 6?" misses the option: cloned from github

[15:33] <lizmat> What version of Rakudo do you have? only lists Rakudo Star versions

[15:33] <timotimo> we should make sure that windows and mac users don't feel left out

[15:33] <timotimo> as well as the BSDs

[15:35] <lizmat> I don't have a Google login, so I can't make chenges

[15:37] <benjikun> lizmat: You don't need a google account to edit the form

[15:38] <benjikun> You should just need the link

[15:42] * lizmat made some changes

[15:44] <benjikun> woohoo

[15:50] <lizmat> afk&

[15:55] <Kaiepi> added node.js to the question about main languages

[15:55] <Kaiepi> shamefully it's mine

[15:56] <benjikun> lol

[15:58] <benjikun> Perhaps we could ask "Are there any modules that you need in Perl 6 that aren't already available?"

[15:58] <timotimo> that kind of sounds like a question that'd get about 99% "yes"

[16:02] <benjikun> Well, we'd add a textbox for them to type in their needed module
