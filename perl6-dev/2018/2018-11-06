[09:02] <nine> .tell cygx I think there's nothing preventing us from having r/w access to foreign lexicals. It already works for package globals and both languages provide sufficient means to intercept variable access. The real trick may be to enumerate lexicals available in a scope.

[09:47] <yoleaux> 09:02Z <nine> cygx: I think there's nothing preventing us from having r/w access to foreign lexicals. It already works for package globals and both languages provide sufficient means to intercept variable access. The real trick may be to enumerate lexicals available in a scope.

[09:47] <cygx> nine: that's why my 'minimal viable product' mockup came with explicit declaration sof lexicals you want to access

[09:48] <cygx> also, couldn't we just parse a subset of Perl5 on the perl6-side (quoting constructs and counting curlies, basically) to find the end of the block?

[09:58] <nine> That would get you far, but you'd run into lovely traps like $"

[09:58] <nine> Also there's regexes which make it a whole lot more complicated

[09:59] <nine> But the pluggable keyword method pmurias suggested should get us all the way there. I've come up with the same idea during some conference talk and his successful experiment is a good indicator that the idea is sound

[10:11] <cygx> still, the minimalist approach could make a nice advent post - though I'm not sure I'll find the time

[10:11] <cygx> the last time I tried anything like this (unbusting FROGGS's v5 after the GLR), I failed miserably ;)

[10:26] <Kaiepi> can anyone rec some books on java i could use to better learn the language?

[10:26] <Kaiepi> atm i only know syntax and what i can forage from documentation

[14:23] <gfldex> I don't quite understand the error message.

[14:23] <timotimo> are they sharing $/ perhaps?

[14:24] <gfldex> that could be, because I got a script that segfaults

[14:24] <timotimo> i bet it will work just fine if you use .contains("g" & "l")

[14:30] <timotimo> that's rather not so good :)

[14:31] <timotimo> does it get better if you do it without "start"?

[14:32] <gfldex> I think there where less elements in the array then hyper was trying to pull.

[14:33] <timotimo> ah, right, you could change the batch number for that purpose

[18:31] <timotimo> now webpack is building all the shit in my node_modules

[18:31] <timotimo> disregarding my         exclude: /node_modules/,

[18:35] <Kaiepi> i added the ops to the oplist in moar, ran tools/update_ops, rebuilt moar, went to nqp, and added the ops to src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp

[18:35] <Kaiepi> but when i run make m-bootstrap-files this happens timotimo

[18:38] <Kaiepi> oh and added them to interp.c

[18:42] <timotimo> but you're not yet using the ops inside of nqp, right?

[18:43] <Kaiepi> not yet, no

[18:44] <timotimo> then everything should work, hm.

[18:44] <timotimo> does the validator not say anything more than that?

[18:44] <timotimo> oh, and where in the oplist did you add the new op?

[18:45] <Kaiepi> right before the spesh ops

[18:45] <Kaiepi> wdym by the validator?

[18:46] <timotimo> "Bytecode validation error at offset 820, instruction

[18:46] <timotimo> 122:"

[18:50] <Kaiepi> oh

[18:51] <Kaiepi> on my last try it gave me this https://hastebin.com/ejuxiwilof.coffeescript
