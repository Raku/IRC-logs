[12:08] <dogbert17> timotimo++ Coverity Scan

[12:08] <timotimo> there's instructions to set up automatic coverity scans from travis ci

[12:09] <dogbert17> aha

[12:09] <dogbert17> did you see that it complained about a *** CID 287723:  Concurrent data access violations  (MISSING_LOCK) in gc/orchestrate.c ?

[12:10] <dogbert17> could the tool be correct or is it wrong

[12:12] <timotimo> it could potentially be wrong. i have not looked closely at that one

[12:12] <timotimo> it definitely doesn't understand compare-and-swap because it thinks the values are unused and leak

[12:12] <dogbert17> still, it seems to be better than many other tools

[12:13] <timotimo> it is very good, indeed

[12:13] <timotimo> clang's scan-build isn't bad either, but coverity is still rather ahead

[12:14] <dogbert17> there is a lock acquired at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/gc/orchestrate.c#L266 but the tools seems to inly that this is not enough

[12:14] <dogbert17> *imply

[12:16] <timotimo> look a few lines above

[12:16] <timotimo> "we're guaranteed the only ones trying to write to it here"

[12:17] <dogbert17> so, false alarm then

[12:17] <timotimo> right

[12:17] <timotimo> we can mark these as false positives

[12:17] <dogbert17> ok, there are a few missing returns as well here and there

[12:18] <timotimo> many of them in my debugserver :D

[12:18] <dogbert17> :)

[12:18] <dogbert17> and in P6bigint

[12:19] <dogbert17> guess those could be false positives as well, hmm

[12:40] <dogbert17> oops

[12:50] <dogbert17> timotimo: what does the 3rdparty component 'cmp' do?

[12:52] <dogbert17> is wondering about this line: https://github.com/MoarVM/cmp/blob/3c5a72eb57bf662c5f9e353d5a3856185a82a35e/cmp.c#L736

[12:53] <timotimo> MessagePack

[12:53] <timotimo> for the debugserver

[12:54] <timotimo> that's a funny line

[12:55] <dogbert17> it's an odd statement on line 736. It soesn't do any damage but one is left wondering of it should look like that

[12:55] <dogbert17> *spelling sucks atm

[12:55] <timotimo> there's as econd one like that there, too

[13:00] <dogbert17> it's a bit strange that's for certain

[13:03] <dogbert17> there are also a pair of JIT related issues that brrt should take a look at

[13:05] <brrt> i already took a look and there's one that a bit serious

[13:05] <brrt> the rest, meh

[13:07] <dogbert17> ok, then I can relax :)

[13:21] <brrt> if it was a truly serious bug, we would've seen it already, probably

[13:24] <lizmat> brrt: I still have flappers in the oddest places when doing spectests

[16:14] <lizmat> to be called whenever someone would like to flush the contents of the Associative, e.g. to disk

[16:26] <timotimo> that seems super weird to me
