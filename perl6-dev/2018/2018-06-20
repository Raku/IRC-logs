[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Make `.?` spesh plugin bug compatible with `.`

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The spesh plugin for `.?` fixed a long-standing issue with method

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: augmented into parent classes not being visible to subclasses. While

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: that's in theory good, in practice there was code in the wild that

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: used `.?` in a filtering step and then `.` to call, and inconsistent

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: behavior between the two (`.?` being fixed and `.` not yet) caused

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: breakage. This is discussed in issue #1923. Therefore, re-introduce

[09:57] <synopsebot_> RAKUDO#1923 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1923 [regression] Regression related to MONKEY-TYPING and spesh-plugins merge

[09:57] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the bug to `.?`, until we can fix `.` too.

[13:06] <AlexDaniel> maybe rakudo changelog should say that it comes with newer MoarVM, or something along the lines

[13:07] <AlexDaniel> because cool moarvm improvements are typically not seen in rakudo changelog, and it's non-obvious that there's a moarvm changelog also

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: f1f3832e11 | (Jonathan Worthington)++ | 3 files

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: First small step for the assignment spesh plugin

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: 

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: So far, it just specializes the case where we have a simple assign

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: to do (no whence, no Nil, typecheck passes). It sets guards and then

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: turns this all into a bindattr, which spesh can then further lower to

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: a pointer write guarded with the GC write barrier.

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: 

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: No worthwhile measurements available yet, due to missing guard JIT and

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: the fact that the generated code still has a good bit of cruft that we

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: could do with eliminating.

[13:24] <Geth> ¦ rakudo/rescalar: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/f1f3832e11

[13:36] <brrt> i'm reading 'missing guard JIT' and hear a call-to-action

[13:37] <timotimo> jnthn: what does it mean that almost all spesh guard indices in the spesh log are 5, but a few are 1? no other values at all?

[13:52] *** skids joined
[14:31] *** brrt left
[14:56] <jnthn> timotimo: That's just the index of the result entry

[14:56] <jnthn> So it means most things are monomorphic and have 4 guards :)

[15:01] <timotimo> is the cruft you were refering to that still needs removed the wval for the Scalar type that's left over at the end?

[15:03] <jnthn> That, but also the guards are inserted always based on what the plugin says

[15:03] <jnthn> But in some cases we already have a guard for that

[15:04] <timotimo> ah, we're not eliminating them based on facts we already know?

[15:04] <jnthn> Right

[15:04] <timotimo> because we can't know that the guard we're looking at isn't the one that established the fact in the first place

[15:04] <timotimo> i.e. a naive implementation would just throw out all guards all the time

[15:05] <jnthn> Well, but it's a bit easier than that

[15:05] <jnthn> We can look if the property we're about to insert a guard for already holds

[15:05] <jnthn> Due to a previous guard

[15:05] <jnthn> And then not insert

[15:05] <timotimo> ah, that'd just be a check of the facts, then

[15:05] <jnthn> Right
