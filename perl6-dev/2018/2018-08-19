[12:58] <gfldex> is there a maximum number of threads Rakudo is willing to spawn?

[12:59] <jnthn> Depends precisely what you're asking.

[12:59] <jnthn> You can call Thread.start({ }) until you run out of resources

[12:59] <jnthn> Which then it's Rakudo's unwillingness :)

[12:59] <jnthn> ThreadPoolScheduler, on the other hand, will do up to 64 by default

[13:00] <jnthn> So if you have more than 64 cores and are CPU bound then a) I'm envious and b) you might want to increase it

[17:35] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: by the way, there's tools/speedup.p6 tool that suggests unambiguous text descriptions for speed improvements

[17:35] <AlexDaniel> e.g. you say ‚Äúso 1.95x faster than Rakudo‚Äù and the tool says 1.96x as fast

[17:40] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[17:44] <pmurias> jnthn: yeah $_ being dynamic is super annoying to optimize, especially given that it is even declared when it's not used

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> what about something like this:

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> m: for ^5 { say { $_ + 1 } ‚Ä¶ 5 }

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar fd6f512be: OUTPUT: ¬´(1 2 3 4 5)‚ê§(2 3 4 5)‚ê§(3 4 5)‚ê§(4 5)‚ê§(5)‚ê§¬ª

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> is this behavior going to change?

[17:49] <stmuk> AlexDaniel: I'm asking about the version of MoarVM not rakudo

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: ah, the one in NQP_REVISION and MOAR_REVISION

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: but also I tend to bump before toasting, so it should be identical to master HEAD

[17:50] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: that's just lexical, not dynamic

[17:50] <timotimo> right?

[17:51] <stmuk> AlexDaniel: thanks

[17:57] <pmurias> does MoarVM use the truffle approach of being able to just assume stuff and when we see the assumption is actuall false being able to just throw away the assumption dependening code and deoptimizing?

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yea I think you're right

[17:58] <pmurias> so it would could a '$_ is never used as dynamic' assumption

[18:04] <timotimo> yeah, that's the speculative optimizations we do

[18:05] <timotimo> but just like the issue says, we'd have to throw away that particular assumption on any call to the outside

[18:15] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: The usage you asked about is entirely lexical. A non-lexical one would involve CALLER:: or CALLERS:: or some such

[20:28] <jnthn> I didn't know that, I thought it was a regression since the last time we toasted, and explained the new set of problems

[20:28] <AlexDaniel> yeah, but it was toasted by Zoffix

[20:29] <AlexDaniel> now that I did it, I had to toast 2018.06 freshly

[20:30] <AlexDaniel> so my completely uneducated and random guess is that it's some change in zef that is making moar blow up

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> *and* it's not something that was fixed on HEAD, because I just had it with freshly installed rakudo and zef on whateverable server

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> statisfiable6: help

[20:32] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, Available stats: core (CORE.setting size), install (size of the installation), libmoar (libmoar.so size) # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Statisfiable

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> statisfiable6: core

[20:32] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, OK! Working on it‚Ä¶

[20:32] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/ec5ee979637aab3197c708dc74410df5

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> statisfiable6: install

[20:33] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, OK! Working on it‚Ä¶

[20:33] <jnthn> The latest zef commit is "Make ecosystem updates and listings multithreaded" :)

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> oh

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: yeah I didn't have time to even take a look, lol

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> :D

[20:34] <jnthn> So I'm guessing that yes, it tickles a bug

[20:36] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/91926c67a4b61a3557c963e04029fa48

[20:36] <jnthn> Did you get to do a toast of HEAD yet?

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: yes: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2230

[20:37] <AlexDaniel> the ones with ‚úó and no comment are likely regressions

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> statisfiable6: libmoar

[20:38] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, OK! Working on it‚Ä¶

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> or something, I'm still going through the list

[20:39] <jnthn> OK, but does the zef thing seem to happen at HEAD too?

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> yes!

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> in fact I had it happen right in front of my eyes when installing deps for whateverable, not just in toaster

[20:40] <jnthn> ah, ok

[20:41] <statisfiable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/3c96c478ce60e3898e258495de8acc21

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> also, this `zef` change seems to rely on `race`, which IIRC is much more broken on older rakudos

[20:42] <AlexDaniel> so e.g. someone having early-2017 rakudo from distro repos will not be able to use zef properly, I think

[20:42] *** brrt left
[20:43] <jnthn> Hm

[20:43] <jnthn> And they'd not have a packaged zef? 

[20:43] <jnthn> I guess maybe not

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> yeah, most distros don't have zef packaged

[20:45] <AlexDaniel> ( https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues/29 )

[20:45] <AlexDaniel> heh the commit message says ‚ÄúSpeeds up `zef update` from 4.3s to 7.8s‚Äù

[20:45] <AlexDaniel> .oO( more seconds, more better )

[20:46] <jnthn> Such is git...you write the commit message, then spot the typo after pushing :)

[21:48] <MasterDuke> "Add some tests for applying offsets to Ranges"

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: pretty sure I can't ssh to hack

[22:24] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ‚Üë?

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> mmm this doesn't say what to do when you can't connect to it https://github.com/perl6/infrastructure-doc/blob/master/hosts/hack.p6c.org.pod

[22:30] <MasterDuke> i guess some people have console access to the server, but i don't have any kind of account, so can't help at all

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> so I'm looking at Audio::Sndfile right now

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> one of the test files segfaults semireliably

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> I just tested it on 2018.05 and there it doesn't

[23:23] *** urdh6 left
[23:23] <AlexDaniel> so something is going on and I should check it

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> one problem is that the module has 12 dependencies and most of them are not in perl6-all-modules :S

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> is there any easy way to tell zef to install a bunch of modules into a folder?

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> so that I can then have a single location to set PERL6LIB to?

[23:24] <jnthn> I think there's some --to=

[23:25] <jnthn> (But don't know the details, sorry)

[23:26] <AlexDaniel> ok I tried `zef install --install-to=. JSON::Fast` and it created a bunch of folders with stuff

[23:26] <AlexDaniel> that's nice, but then?

[23:28] <jnthn> Can you then put . in PERL6LIB and have it work?

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> tried that, doesn't work

[23:28] <jnthn> Hmm

[23:28] <jnthn> What if it's --to=file#. if it allows that?

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> no, I don't think so

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> but is there no way to point perl6 executable to a whole repository?

[23:35] <jnthn> Does -Iinst#. or some such work?

[23:35] <jnthn> iiuc, it's kind-of-repo#path

[23:35] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: Yes!!!

[23:36] <jnthn> :)

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> ok that is awesome

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> I should've figured it out earlier, will make my work so much easier

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> or, well, asked :)

[23:52] <timotimo> i was just able to reach hack via ssh
