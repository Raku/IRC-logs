[19:04] <AlexDaniel> does it mean that the config file is different depending on which version of rakudo you use?

[19:07] <yoleaux> 19 Oct 2018 17:51Z <Zoffix> brrt: nevermind, I managed to bisect that ticket to post-release-opts merge in MoarVM, so it wasn't the event loop stuff. Still any ideas on what could be the bug welcome :)

[19:07] <yoleaux> 19 Oct 2018 18:02Z <Zoffix> brrt: It's this commit that's causing it: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/commit/8f3a16b6ea748d3dbe62327a2e1e502935ea61ea

[19:07] <brrt> okay Zoffix

[19:08] <timotimo> oh hey brrt

[19:08] <timotimo> are you interested in checking this out?

[19:08] <brrt> ohai timotimo

[19:08] <timotimo> i'm just a little baffled by it

[19:08] <brrt> i'm silenced in #moarvm :-(

[19:08] <brrt> well, to be honest, I can have a look, but I won't be doing much coding this evening

[19:08] <timotimo> i have not yet been given privileges to op myself there

[19:08] <AlexDaniel> brrt: fixed

[19:08] <brrt> ty AlexDaniel :-)

[19:08] <timotimo> OK, so the problem with that bug is: attaching anything in the way of debugging tools makes it go away

[19:09] <timotimo> i tried strace and perf trace, though i have not tried perf record or rr record yet

[19:09] <timotimo> additionally, i didn't reproduce it locally, though i think i might know how to do it

[19:10] <timotimo> what's more, reverting the commit in question fixing the bug doesn't make much sense to me

[19:10] <brrt> lol

[19:10] <timotimo> first i thought maybe the spesh facts aren't being marked as required and so there's deopt trouble

[19:10] <timotimo> but i do see code to do the marking

[19:11] <brrt> what commit is the matter

[19:11] <brrt> the commit that Zoffix gave us?

[19:11] <timotimo> yes

[19:12] <brrt> hmmmmm

[19:12] <timotimo> Zoffix, can you perhaps spin up that vm again?

[19:12] <brrt> what do the JIT logs say?

[19:12] <brrt> eh, spesh logs, these days

[20:02] <timotimo> damn it, i can't even reproduce the bug on the VM now

[20:04] <Zoffix> :|

[20:04] <Zoffix> Did you remember to declutter the precomp files?

[20:04] <timotimo> i think i did it right, but perhaps not

[20:04] <timotimo> can you connect as cpan@ and "tmux a" to get into my session?

[20:06] <Zoffix> The test file has "my $*EXECUTABLE = "./perl6-m";" in it... Could that be affecting the non-reproduction of bug?

[20:06] <timotimo> ah, i did that!

[20:06] <timotimo> i threw it out just now

[20:07] <timotimo> did you change something else?

[20:07] <Zoffix> just ran declutter

[20:07] <timotimo> regenerated the .rakudo.moarvm file?

[20:08] <timotimo> i had some dumb debug output hacked in there %)

[20:08] <Zoffix> Yeah

[20:08] <Zoffix> k, now I can repro the bug

[20:08] <Zoffix> cpan@temp-perl6-dev:~/R/rakudo$ declutter; t/fudgeandrun t/spec/S32-io/io-cathandle.t

[20:08] <Zoffix> with that

[20:08] * Zoffix afk

[20:09] <timotimo> OK

[20:12] <timotimo> I ... i can't reproduce it though

[20:12] <timotimo> this bug is *really* slippery

[20:19] <Zoffix> I can. You sure you're running `declutter` and the rest in ~/R/rakudo?

[20:19] <timotimo> i think i am. you're not rm-ing the .precomp folder under t/spec/Packages or what it was?

[20:19] <timotimo> packages not Packages

[20:20] <Zoffix> declutter is aliased to `rm -fr */.precomp; rm -fr */*/.precomp; rm -fr */*/*/.precomp; rm -fr */*/*/*/.precomp'

[20:20] <Zoffix> So presumably yes I am

[20:21] <timotimo> oh, ok

[20:21] <timotimo> how do you decide whether you reproduced it?

[20:22] <timotimo> the whole fudgeandrun takes 13 seconds at the moment, but the test i'm looking at in particular, the last one, runs in under a second

[20:23] <timotimo> 20s user time, 13.5 real time

[20:23] <Zoffix> lemme measure

[20:25] <Zoffix> So after doing t/fudgeandrun so it gens the fudge file, I do `declutter; time ./perl6 t/spec/S32-io/io-cathandle.rakudo.moar` and get 9.864s  while on perl6 I get it for 5.5

[20:26] <Zoffix> Less than 40s vs. 3s I had before but still visible diff.

[20:27] <timotimo> it's not the bug any more where it just stands still for about 15 to 20 seconds for no discernable reason

[20:27] <timotimo> that was what i was trying to hunt down

[20:27] <timotimo> and that is gone

[20:27] <timotimo> i'd say the other thing is "just" a performance regression

[20:27] <Zoffix> FWIW, the other two blockers are far more important IMO. This is just a perf penalty in some arcane code on some machines, while others are clear regressions R#2400 and  R#2355

[20:27] <synopsebot> R#2400 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2400 [fudged tests committed][regression][⚠ blocker ⚠] Module Crane is failing tests on HEAD

[20:27] <synopsebot> R#2355 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2355 [SEGV][regression][⚠ blocker ⚠] Concurrency feature race/hyper sometimes failed with Supply

[20:28] <Zoffix> I mean, if you have the skills to fix them

[20:28] <Zoffix> The R#2400 in particular. There's already a fix for a very similar bug, so presumably the new fix would be easy if you know that codepath

[20:28] <Zoffix> timotimo: so did you make some changes to get the bug to go away or did it just disappear randomly?

[20:28] <timotimo> not exactly sure

[20:29] <timotimo> i tried a lot of stuff to hook up diagnostics and tools and such, and that never gave me the hang
