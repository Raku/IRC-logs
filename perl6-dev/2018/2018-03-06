[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: Update "Polishing Rationals" proposal to rev2

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: - Change plan to create FatRats in cases where we currently make

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:     broken Rats to instead make fatty RatStrs

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: - A fatty RatStr type-wise is indistinguishable from a regular

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:     RatStr, but internally has the ability to offer FatRat-like

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:     precision in contexts where FatRat can be usedâ€”basically it

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:     functions as a non-infectious FatRat.

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:

[03:54] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: (N.B.: still need to do a proof-of-concept trial impl of this idea)

[12:19] <lizmat> afk again&

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> lol I guess someone is having fun reproducing the bug? XD

[18:27] <AlexDaniel> â€¦ the issue disappears if I remove this line: my $host-arch = $*KERNEL.hardware;

[18:27] <AlexDaniel> which maybe makes sense because it does qqx under the hood

[18:27] <AlexDaniel> ( https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/296 )

[18:40] <AlexDaniel> ooooooooooooooooooooooooo

[18:40] <AlexDaniel> reproduced locally! YEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssss!

[18:51] <timotimo> i get loads and loads of enters and afters

[18:52] <AlexDaniel> â†‘ you go to that link, cancel the download, and the whole refuses to work after that. Can't get any more frustrating for me :(

[18:52] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: is that rakudo HEAD?

[18:53] <timotimo> yeah

[18:53] <timotimo> and probably some non-release commit of cro

[18:53] <timotimo> ... a crommit

[18:54] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: well, that's really sad. Thanks.

[18:54] <AlexDaniel> I see the same behavior on the server and on my machine

[18:56] <AlexDaniel> â†‘ you see, someone followed my advice xD

[18:59] <dogbert17> are you on Cro 0.7.3 ?

[18:59] <AlexDaniel> yes

[19:04] <dogbert17> it works for me unless I press 'Cancel' just after refresh, then I get 'broken pipe'

[19:05] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: This way you can temporarily handle Ctrl-C and

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo:

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: The array @last-utils isn't native on the JVM (cmp. commit 581edd58e9),

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: so we can't use nqp::shift_n and nqp::push_n here.

[21:18] <Geth> Â¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8d954027fd

[21:21] <Zoffix> Thinking of an article I'll write for Rationals eventually and RatStr being an allomorph for Rat, FatRat, and Str just doesn't jive well. Feels shoe-hornish. Like, if I want an allomorph of a Rat and RatStr, why am I forced to lug around a multi-byte string version of it I'll likely never use.

[21:22] <Zoffix> Gonna do a trial impl and see how insane a new type (and its Str allomorph) make the operator dispatch be

[21:23] <Zoffix> A non-infectious FatRat  (AlloRat? MuskRat? MidRat?)

[21:23] <Zoffix> yet that feels overkillish

[21:24] <Zoffix> .oO( make Str part of RatStr optional if FatRat part is given )

[21:26] <Zoffix> But that still leaves a wart that if I type enough digits after the decimal point I may get a Str object (its subclass of course, but still something that gets accepted in Str recepticles)

[21:29] <Zoffix> timotimo: the PRs been there for like a month amd was mentioned in a weekly, so looks like no one has any objections to merging it :)

[21:30] <Zoffix> (err, above I meant an allomorph of Rat and FatRat, in the "lug Str part")

[21:31] <timotimo> i'll make the changes i alluded to in the description and merge it

[22:30] <dogbert17> so the comment from liz that your fixes were reverted are bogus ...

[22:32] <Zoffix> dogbert17: the comment is from 2016, before the IO grant, and references the original, 2015 incantation of IO::CatHandle
