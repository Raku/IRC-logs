[14:16] <patrickb> Hi everyone! I'm working on some rather trivial script involving regexes. I observe some behaviour I am unsure whether it's buggy or just my ignorance....

[14:16] <patrickb> m: my $d = '\d+'; say '123' ~~ / $d /; say '123' ~~ / ${$d} /; say '123' ~~ / \d+ /;

[14:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 194c84b91: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§ÔΩ¢ÔΩ£‚ê§ÔΩ¢123ÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[14:17] <patrickb> I'd have expected all three to return '123'.

[14:23] <gfldex> m: my $d = '\d+'; say '123' ~~ / <$d> /; say '123' ~~ / ${$d} /; say '123' ~~ / \d+ /;

[14:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 194c84b91: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢123ÔΩ£‚ê§ÔΩ¢ÔΩ£‚ê§ÔΩ¢123ÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[14:23] <gfldex> patrickb: ^^^ special stuff inside a grammar happens inside <>

[14:28] <patrickb> gfldex: Thanks! I'm still somehow trying to figure this out...

[16:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 194c84b91: OUTPUT: ¬´ÔΩ¢\d+ÔΩ£‚ê§¬ª

[16:02] <timotimo> putting something in a regex with just $foo will match the contents literally

[20:16] <Kaiepi> i get "MoarVM op 'getsockopts' is unknown as a core or extension op" when trying to build nqp for something i'm working on

[20:16] <Kaiepi> how do i fix this?

[20:22] <Kaiepi> never mind, i forgot the --prefix flag when building moar

[21:07] <jdv79> how come a docs site search for "slurp" turns up entries for "sleep" and more importantly doesn't include /language/io which by the way still uses slurp-rest

[21:13] <AlexDaniel> jdv79: sleep shows up because of fuzzy search, it's ok I think

[21:13] <AlexDaniel> I mean, it's LTA, but it's not horrible

[21:13] <Kaiepi> i'm thinking of reimplimenting the asyncsocket op so IO::Socket::Async can be more consistent with IO::Socket::INET by allowing you to use .new to initialize a socket before connect/bind is used

[21:13] <jdv79> i logged the issues

[21:13] <Kaiepi> also to make it possible to use SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT with async sockets

[21:14] <Kaiepi> with setsockopt/getsockopt

[21:14] <Kaiepi> thoughts?
