[16:52] <tbrowder_> samcv: ok, iâ€™m still looking at those chars, but i

[16:54] <tbrowder_> my first thought is that p6 might be used for typesetting utilities in all languages so ee should look carefully at all whitespace, etc.

[16:56] <tbrowder_> i also want to look at S26 again more carefully to make sure pod paragraphs are being handled properly.

[17:01] <samcv> that sounds good

[17:06] <tbrowder_> in all that, iâ€™m curious about some ws chars that may not have Zs properties but should perhaps should be candidates for showing True with $char ~~ /\s/.

[17:06] <tbrowder_> bad break: true with $char ~~ /\s/

[22:15] <japhb> Is there something stricter than Test::META::meta-ok ?  I've got an annoying crash trying to do 'zef install .' (early on, before debug output) for a module I'm working on locally, and I can't figure out whether it's purely a zef bug, or something not quite right in my META6 that's breaking some invariant.

[22:16] <japhb> (And as you might guess, meta-ok think's it's just spiffy.  Which isn't too surprising, as it's managed by mi6, but you never know.)
