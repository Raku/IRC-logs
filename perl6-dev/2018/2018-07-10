[11:10] <Ven`> Zoffix: the quizlet thing you mentioned in a tweet, is it similar to a SRS app?

[11:10] <Ven`> I've been interested in getting a programming deck for some languages but was never sure how to approach it

[11:22] <Zoffix> Ven`: dunno what SRS app is. Here's one of the decks for the Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/79497572/my-first-french-words-with-ch-flash-cards/ there are several options for studying the words, including matching games. And if you go to "Learn" module https://quizlet.com/79497572/learn there are options (bottom left) for selecting what type of exercises you get shown. So I select "multiple choice" and

[11:22] <Zoffix> "written questions", where you have to type the answer, spelling it correctly. So it starts showing you the words, until you get them all right. And it has an algo for training you the words that you mess up, like switching to multiple choice if you mess up spelling to many times, or comming back a bit later to the words you messed up. In 1 months I went from 0 French to being good enough to go to "Level

[11:22] <Zoffix> 2", and I can largely thank this "learn" quizlet thing... And I was thinking the same type of concept can be applied to learning Perl 6 language and instead of matching French to English, you'd be matching, say, methods to the args they take or something :)

[12:54] <jkramer> scovit: You mean linking to directories/creating links in directories? Or copying/moving links?

[12:55] <jkramer> The ticket didn't say anything about that, I just implemented what was asked for in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1453 :)

[12:55] <scovit> jkramer I meant what if I what to create a link to file in a target directory?

[12:56] <scovit> it seems to me in the same spirit as your patch

[12:56] <jkramer> Oh you meant the routines link/symlink

[12:56] <scovit> lep

[12:56] <scovit> s/l/y/

[12:59] <jkramer> Yeah true, might add that there too. But I think I'll wait for feedback about the implementation in the PR for a bit before going on so I don't have to re-do/change it all if my code is BS :)

[12:59] <scovit> Right, don't know what others think. On top of that, GNU ln have a single argument "signature" where target is implicitly "."; but I am not sure Perl6 aims to the same level of DWIMmy

[13:01] <jkramer> Hmm probably not, I think guessing '.' as destination by default would be a bit weird and might be a pitfall.

[13:02] <jkramer> I mean it's relatively obvious what you mean if you use a directory as destination, but if you omit it altogether that should cause an error IMO.

[13:04] <scovit> yes I would agree, default to '.' is far more obvious in a shell than in a scripting language (and not sure Perl 6 is a scripting language either)

[13:05] <jkramer> Yup, in a shell the current directory is something the user is usually aware of. In coding (any language except shell scripting maybe) not so much.

[13:08] <scovit> regarding your patch, python accepts directory as a destination, java doesn't

[13:11] <scovit> I am a bit surprised about python: I am going to say something bizarre, but I thought that that language was created and pushed by persons that get paid by "line of code"

[13:11] <scovit> in that case adding directories as destinations does not fit the philosophy since it saves a line of code

[13:12] <timo> will probably have to be $*CWD instead of "." in order to work properly

[20:49] <lizmat> what information are you trying to glean from uname -a ?

[20:52] <DrForr> Well, it's actually not useful as I realized while typing in the main channel because users can upgrade their libreadline package independently of the installation, so searching a list of directory paths seems the only sensible way to find the current readline library.

[21:28] <timotimo> samcv: fun, it uses nums internally for something

[21:33] <timotimo> but still, it's mostly GC bound

[21:38] <samcv> timotimo: yeah. i made it much faster by making the HASH_ITER thing faster. but i think it's maybe because it has to do every single element in the hash

[21:38] <samcv> which takes a long time

[21:38] <timotimo> i'm trying to figure out what it uses smart_numify for

[21:39] <samcv> timotimo: that's only using like 0.24% self and 0.695% inclusive though

[21:40] <timotimo> it shouldn't be using floating point math for anything :)

[21:40] <samcv> ah

[21:41] <samcv> but it doesn't seem to be calling any other functions realy from MVMHash_gc_mark

[21:41] <samcv> that i can see at least

[21:41] <timotimo> that makes sense to me

[21:41] <timotimo> gc_mark functions put a bunch of stuff into the work queue and return to the work loop

[21:41] <samcv> i think i ran it on -Og and still didn't see anything show up

[21:42] <samcv> hm

[21:42] <timotimo> worklist_add is most probably inlined, or even a macro

[21:42] <timotimo> yup, it's a macro

[21:42] <samcv> yeah macro

[21:42] <timotimo> there's a slow path for when the worklist needs to be grown

[21:52] <timotimo> thanks to your code, btw, i added some pieces to the profiler's allocation logger

[21:52] <timotimo> coerce_ns and coerce_is and smrt_strify were missing

[21:54] *** MasterDuke joined
[22:03] <samcv> timotimo: oh hm. i didn't know things had to be added?

[22:06] <timotimo> neither did i

[22:10] <MasterDuke> pmurias: how difficult do you think adding for loops to the truffle backend will be?

[22:10] <timotimo> but i did a --profile and saw it showed barely any allocations

[22:10] <timotimo> when in fact it stringifies a lot of ints

[22:28] <pmurias> MasterDuke: if we turn the optimizer on for loops are optimized into while loops

[22:29] <pmurias> MasterDuke: also it seems that Truffle has speciall support to have the loops run faster: https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/LoopNode.html

[22:31] <pmurias> MasterDuke: a for loop shouldn't be super difficult, it should be like a regular loop with some fiddling to pass in an argument to the block

[22:42] <MasterDuke> pmurias: hm, maybe i'm missing something. i don't think any type of loop is supported right now, correct?

[22:43] <MasterDuke> timotimo: how did you do the adding? is there a way to figure out if anything else needs to be added?

[22:44] <timotimo> there's a big switch/case in profiler/instrument.c that has all instructions in them that can allocate

[22:46] <MasterDuke> ah

[23:01] <MasterDuke> samcv: i think a good grant proposal could crafted around automated benchmarking added to travis and appveyor. e.g., a collection of benchmarks like https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench + [TuxCM]'s + Ulti's + rindolf's

[23:11] <japhb> MasterDuke, samcv: There's no reason perl6-bench couldn't easily absorb the others.  The one thing that would be a useful would be a standard step for generating/downloading large data sets, for things that want to test against e.g. a hundred megs of JSON files.

[23:12] <japhb> Other than that, it was already designed to be expanded over time.

[23:12] <japhb> Mind you, it probably has some functionality and defaults that we'd want to tune these days -- compatibility with pre-Christmas Perl 6 implementations is probably not really useful anymore, for instance.

[23:13] <japhb> I welcome PRs and/or co-maintainers.
