[10:45] <lizmat> aaaahhh... ok, got it I guess...  %0 is an existing hash

[11:11] <jnthn> Yeah, %0 is, I think, just $0.hash

[11:11] <lizmat> yeah.. it's a bit of a WAT when trying to create format strings that start %0  :-)

[11:12] <lizmat> %0{ $buf.elems * 8 }b

[16:22] <samcv> AlexDaniel, can i just replace the 2018.12 release with a new tar?

[16:22] <samcv> if none of the files inside it have changed?

[16:34] *** robertle left
[16:58] <lucasb> out of curiosity, did you spot some problem with the current tarball?

[18:11] *** robertle joined
[18:12] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[18:51] <japhb> .tell lizmat Actually, I think `my int $bits = 65; dd 1 +< $bits` ==> 2 is in fact a bug, unless we have decided +< on int has rotation semantics, rather than shift.  Otherwise it should be 0 (all 1 bits have shifted entirely off to the left, rather than reappearing on the right when they exited on the left)

[18:51] <yoleaux> japhb: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> samcv: no, can't change the file

[20:01] <AlexDaniel> e.g. undersightable6 will not like it

[20:24] *** ufobat_ left
[20:38] *** robertle left
[21:17] <japhb> I suspect some behavior changed with the CUR merge that is not accounted by zef.  Building a fresh Rakudo, then zef, then modules that depend on *both* JSON::Fast and JSON::Marshall gets errors during testing that JSON::Marshall cannot find JSON::Fast (which has been tested earlier due to dependency order but not yet installed because they're all part of the same zef install request).
