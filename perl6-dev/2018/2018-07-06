[20:00] <pmurias> how do I get better execptions from nqp-j, I loose the java land part of things like NullPointerException

[20:29] <MasterDuke> pmurias: are these lines needed? https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/truffle/nqp-truffle.nqp#L7-L11

[20:51] *** lizmat joined

[21:14] <pmurias> MasterDuke: passing the @ARGS is needed

[21:14] <MasterDuke> pmurias: but not the `:module-path('gen/js/stage2')`, etc?

[21:15] <pmurias> not that

[21:16] <pmurias> MasterDuke: the whole thing is hastily cargo culted from a js cross compiling script, it's not how things should be after we bootstrap, ditch the jvm bytecode backend and run fully on truffle

[21:18] <pmurias> I think we will uncommented the optimization insertion soon

[21:20] <pmurias> I would need sleep to think over what we can strip from that but not sure how important cleaning that up is

[21:20] <pmurias> MasterDuke: is any of that causing problems?

[21:21] <MasterDuke> pmurias: nope, just curious

[21:21] <pmurias> ok ;)

[21:22] <pmurias> it's a temporary hack so I just cargo culted something up at the start of the backend and didn't touch it since

[21:22] <pmurias> ;)

[21:22] <MasterDuke> pmurias: ah, another probably-not-terribly-serious question. some files have a copyright statement at the top, but not all. is it needed?

[21:24] <MasterDuke> pmurias: and re temporary hacks and cargo culting, i certainly don't hold any high ground, i'm not sure i've contributed an original line to the truffle stuff, it's pretty much all been copied from you or the original jvm code

[21:25] <pmurias> I'm sometimes copying/adapting stuff from the example simplelanguage/graal.js and I copy the copyright headers too

[21:26] <pmurias> I'm not a lawyer but I would prefer to stay as safe as possible in regards to copywrite matters with Oracle

[21:27] <pmurias> * copyright

[21:27] <MasterDuke> very true

[21:35] <timotimo> watching daina pettit's "perl optimization tidbits", it surprises me greatly that in perl5 there's noticable performance differences between "or" and "||" as well as "and" and "&&"

[21:35] <timotimo> my first attempt at measuring perl6 with this gives me all four being pretty much the same speed

[21:36] <timotimo> MFW "for ^10_000_000 { $x }" is actually faster than "for ^10_000_000 { }"

[21:36] <timotimo> "or is about twice as fast as and" in perl5

[21:37] <timotimo> perl 5.22, to b exact

[21:45] <pmurias> timotimo: the whole talk seems like something specific to an implementation without a well defined/separated AST layer

[21:45] <timotimo> but you can already output the optree it builds, right?

[21:49] <pmurias> timotimo: you can print the optree

[21:50] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:50] <pmurias> timotimo: but it seems to be a lot more oriented towards how it will be run

[21:50] <pmurias> timotimo: QAST was afaik designed to run on parrot

[21:51] <timotimo> i don't know about that

[21:54] <jnthn> No, QAST was the successor to PAST. PAST was designed to run on Parrot. QAST was a step away from that to something more general.

[21:56] <MasterDuke> pmurias: did you see my comment on https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/f502ee0f18c0e570570823615513f2cd4f65ac5f ?
