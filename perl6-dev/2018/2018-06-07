[00:22] <Tison> long time ago, timo added two MoarVM ops, it is still vaild? If so, let's merge it; otherwise we can close it safely

[00:25] <timotimo> hm, it's probably fine to just merge

[00:25] <timotimo> we are the knights who coerce ni.

[00:25] <timotimo> i think i wanted to use this in "performance critical" perl6 code, but using nqp ops in the ecosystem isn't very friendly

[00:27] <Tison> it takes a little time to understand why coerce_"ni" :P

[15:16] <raiph> Hi all. Anyone know anything about why FROGGS' commit "Support shapes for HAS scoped attributes" https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/36c92d58f8 hasn't been merged or was merged and backed out?

[15:16] <yoleaux> 16 Feb 2018 18:57Z <Zoffix> raiph: Wanted to accept your challenge for writing a blog post from here ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48488381/perl6-comparison-operator#comment83973425_48489204 ), since how we make changes is fairly-well defined, but I'm not following what's the "ouch" stuff about and what "aspect of 2017.01"?

[15:16] <yoleaux> 16 Feb 2018 19:00Z <Zoffix> raiph: Ah, nm, that stuff was in reference to the update on OP. Sure, I can explain how stuff like that can happen in a blog post.

[15:33] <raiph> .tell Zoffix Thanks for ^^^ post. "There are some limitations to it (e.g. methods on classes)" Isn't that a pretty big hole in the cheese? Might Rakudo theoretically one day (say, 5 years from now given corporate funding) be able to load `:ver` / `:auth` / `:api` versioned cores, compiling a compunit with its matching core to sharply reduce the siz

[15:33] <yoleaux> raiph: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[15:33] <raiph> e of this hole?

[15:36] <raiph> hmm. Maybe it *was* merged. I think I typo'd my attempt to try it.

[16:21] <Tison> I saw this branch of NQP just now, and wonder what 'spesh' stands for, what it will bring to NQP. (https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commits/pluggable-spesh)

[16:23] <jnthn> Tison: https://gist.github.com/jnthn/e51a06c6882fbc6219e0fa0a3dd373e6

[16:23] <jnthn> spesh is short for "specializer"

[16:24] <Tison> jnthn: thanks

[16:24] <jnthn> (Noting that the shortening works when said out loud :))

[16:24] <jnthn> (Also because the word "spec" is already heavily used in the community, so I avoided that shortening.)

[16:24] <Tison> it's right XD

[16:25] <jnthn> It's the MoarVM dynamic optimizer (e.g. profiles code and optimizes it for the paths/types that show up)

[16:26] <jnthn> On x64 its output is them compiled into machine code (JIT); on other platforms it results in quickened bytecode

[16:31] <Tison> get

[16:32] <timotimo> Tison: don't know if anybody told you yet; regenerating bootstrap is done with a make rule, make bootstrap-files-m or make bootstrap-files-j

[16:35] <Tison> yes I know, but the previous .gitignore file ignore all *.moarvm, (I think) including those under stage0

[16:37] <Tison> the experience is I generate new bootstrap file locally, but cannot commit because git ignores them. That what confuses me.

[16:39] <Tison> and you can see I replace `*.moar` with `/*.moar` (

[16:42] <timotimo> weird, i never had that problem

[16:42] <timotimo> maybe that change was somewhat recent?

[16:47] <Tison> oh

[16:47] <Tison> I know that because I do a git init locally

[16:47] <Tison> if the file trace before gitignore ignore it, then it remains traced

[16:49] <timotimo> git is funny

[16:57] <raiph> .tell FROGGS Fyi, https://stackoverflow.com/a/50745483/1077672

[16:57] <yoleaux> raiph: I'll pass your message to FROGGS.
