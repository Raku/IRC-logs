[00:05] <Kaiepi> wait, i don't have to refactor SocketHandle on the jvm at all to get getsockopt/setsockopt to work

[01:21] <Kaiepi> 1

[01:21] <Kaiepi> \o/

[01:23] <timotimo> \o/

[01:29] <Kaiepi> all that's left to be done before this can stop being a wip is mergine https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2475, since i need access to $!VMIO in IO::Socket::Async::ListenSocket

[01:32] <timotimo> LGTM, though of course it will have to be merged at the same time as the others, right?

[01:33] <timotimo> when is a socket a tty?

[01:34] <timotimo> oh, here's a problem

[01:34] <timotimo> in moarvm you changed an MVMROOT2 to an MVMROOT3 to include a ListenInfo struct

[01:34] <timotimo> but we are only allowed to root objects that have the MVMCollectable header, or rather: in this case we don't have to root at all because that data won't move during GC

[01:36] <Kaiepi> ah

[01:39] <Kaiepi> fixed now

[01:40] <Kaiepi> a socket will likely never be a tty, but i included the functions to check for it anyway

[01:41] <timotimo> i think the java changes also look OK

[01:43] <Kaiepi> shit i forgot to add IIOOptions.java

[01:44] <timotimo> oops, and i didn't notice

[01:44] <timotimo> well, so much for the quality of my code review?

[01:44] <Kaiepi> lol

[01:45] <Kaiepi> lemme know when the .native-descriptor commits get merged so i can update the rakudo parts of the getsockopt/setsockopt commits

[15:00] <timotimo> the .party domains can be thrown out, i believe

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ? What's the alternative?

[15:03] <mst> thrown out?

[15:04] <timotimo> well, they are no longer registered to any perl6-related person, i believe?

[15:04] <timotimo> so unless we want to monitor very closely the actions of some domain parkers, we can leave it out

[15:04] <AlexDaniel> so where did these move?

[15:04] <timotimo> oh

[15:04] <timotimo> i'm wrong about at least perl6.party

[15:05] <mst> somebody linked raku.party which was held by some random person independent of the current stuff

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> ZofBot and dalek seem to be offline

[15:05] <timotimo> that one literally just has an expired certificate

[15:05] <timotimo> my bad!

[15:07] <mst> and if we need anything involving his infrastructure I'm happy to chat to him

[15:07] <timotimo> yeah, raku.party was pretty amusing

[15:07] <timotimo> it's a very "The Internet" thing, to me at least

[15:07] <mst> hoping that I can act as a cut out between him and the drama

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: eh, can you connect to hack?

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> Geth: help

[15:09] <Geth> AlexDaniel, Source at https://github.com/perl6/geth To add repo, add an 'application/json' webhook on GitHub pointing it to http://hack.p6c.org:8888/?chan=#perl6 and choose 'Send me everything' for events to send | use `ver URL to commit` to fetch version bump changes

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> ah, so geth is online

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> hmmm

[15:10] <timotimo> my first attempt to reach hack resulted in a "connection closed by remote host" in a very early stage of the connection process

[15:10] <timotimo> but yeah, i get the ssh key digest and then just waiting

[15:10] <timotimo> let me have a look if it needs restarted

[15:10] <timotimo> yup it's hanging again

[15:11] <AlexDaniel> but but

[15:11] <AlexDaniel> Geth?

[15:11] <AlexDaniel> seems to be responsive

[15:11] <timotimo> well

[15:11] <timotimo> the failure mode is "the hard drive doesn't react any more, and anything that tries to hit the disk will hang infinitely on the system call"

[15:12] <timotimo> so processes that don't look at the hard disk - at all or just for a long time - will seem responsive

[15:12] <AlexDaniel> alright, restart it :)
