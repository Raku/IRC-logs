[21:59] <tbrowder_> i’m experimenting with removing %*LANG from nqp and rakudo. how do i force rakudo to use the modified nqp which is in a separate repo?

[22:12] <perlpilot> tbrowder: It's been a long time since I've built like this, but I think you do (from within the rakudo dir):  perl Configure.pl --backends=moar --gen-moar --with-nqp=/path/to/other/nqp

[22:12] <perlpilot> that path is to the nqp binary, not the directory where nqp is located

[22:16] <tbrowder_> ok, thanks, i’ll give that a shot.

[22:24] *** Zoffix joined
[22:25] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: FWIW, Z-Script script makes it very easy to hack on nqp and stuff. You'd just make your changes in its nqp checkout and then run `z n` to rebuild nqp and rakudo on top of it
