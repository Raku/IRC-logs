[15:42] <thundergnat> Hi. I've been "smoke testing" a recent dev commit for regressions by running 850 or so Rosettacode tasks and I'm getting some new failures installing some modules that didn't happen in 2018.06.

[15:42] <thundergnat> U?sing:  Rakudo version 2018.06-238-g66303db built on MoarVM version 2018.06-304-g4d22fb9 

[15:43] <thundergnat> *Using 

[15:45] <thundergnat> Net::FTP and Net::DNS are both failing with an error about missing "use experimental :pack" even though it is definitely in each module.

[15:45] <thundergnat> Specifically: "Use of the 'unpack' method is experimental; please 'use experimental :pack'"

[15:46] <thundergnat> I think the fact that they are both Net:: modules is a coincidence, it is just that they both use unpack.

[15:47] <thundergnat> Interestingly enough, it doesn't seem to fail at a command line, only when using a pre-compiled module.

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> could it be that thundergnat was using older versions?

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> of modules I mean

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> also, the change to unpack was already in 2018.06, so hmmm…
