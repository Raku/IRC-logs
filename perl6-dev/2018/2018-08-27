[15:38] <pmurias> for how to add globalish state you can look look NQPScope.getHLLs is implemented

[15:47] *** AlexDaniel left
[15:50] <MasterDuke> pmurias: i was just looking at some of the *_I ops, which use (get|make)BI, which has boxing and REPR stuff and things like `tc.native_j = (BigInteger) getBI(tc, obj.get_attribute_boxed(tc, null, null, hint), innerType);`

[15:51] <pmurias> I don't think we want to pass around arguments on thread context attributes

[15:52] <pmurias> for the _I ops we will need objects working

[15:53] <pmurias> I have the start of deserialization which is needed of object in an uncommited state
