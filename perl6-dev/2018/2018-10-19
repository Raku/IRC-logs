[02:46] <Zoffix> heh

[02:47] <Zoffix> There's a minor mess up in that commit: we try to .sink-all after receiving IterationEnd, but I don't see why that'd result in non-100% reproduceable failure

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> maybe it's GCE doing some kind of long-term storage thingie, but there's a gazzilion of files there indeed

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> which makes me realize that we really don't clean precomp files at all

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> right?

[02:48] <Zoffix> Right

[02:49] <Zoffix> omg, it hung again

[02:50] <Zoffix> Consistently hangs if I cleanup precomp after each run

[02:51] <Zoffix> Oh, it's not .words, it's the test afterwards "IO::CatHandle.read does not switch to another handle too early"

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> heh, lizmat's commit broke two modules. Both modules are by lizmat.

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> .tell lizmat R#2398

[22:22] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[22:22] <synopsebot> R#2398 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2398 [regression][⚠ blocker ⚠] Two modules failing after “Refactor the use of STORE(:initialize)”

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> cognominal-p6: dunno, but we can try this

[22:43] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/e4432a7c297ad996d305ae1e31ea0fc0

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> so it used to return nothing, I guess, I don't know if that's right

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> but we can see when it changed

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> bisect: say Match.^roles

[22:43] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, Bisecting by exit code (old=2015.12 new=a804ab5). Old exit code: 0

[22:44] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/a25906f6364c3469b8890c5080f9c051

[22:44] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, There are 20 candidates for the first “new” revision. See the log for more details

[22:45] <AlexDaniel> well, that's extremely helpful

[22:45] <AlexDaniel> :P

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> it's right that it changed after uncurse merge, so that gives a clue or two…

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> cognominal-p6: please file a bug report
