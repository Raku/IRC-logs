[00:25] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: next

[00:25] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in 3 days and ≈18 hours. Blockers: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22%E2%9A%A0+blocker+%E2%9A%A0%22. Unknown changelog format

[01:20] <[Coke]> does he ever not complain about the changelog format?

[01:29] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: yes ↑

[01:30] <AlexDaniel> at this moment it's only useful right before the release when the actual changelog is committed

[01:32] <AlexDaniel> I can change it so that it understands the wiki page https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[01:33] <AlexDaniel> but given how popular this idea is… maybe not

[01:36] <timotimo> oh, i just didn't write anything in the changelog because i didn't do anything this month

[01:37] <timotimo> okay, i jitted isprime_I on moarvm

[01:38] <timotimo> oh, microoptimizing the DON'T_DIVIDE_NUMBERS function was this month, too

[01:39] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: the JIT change should be here I think https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/wiki/ChangeLog-Draft

[01:39] <timotimo> it's also almost completely worthless ;)

[01:39] <[Coke]> \o/

[01:41] <AlexDaniel> FWIW I'm OK with changelogging all of rakudo changes, my goal was to stimulate microcontributions to the release process but this is not necessarily required

[10:53] <jnthn> Got a fix for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1410 and testing it

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Sanitize one-whenever supply input

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Previously it was serialized, but this makes sure it follows protocol

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: also, so we can safely rely on that internally.

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 2192ddd170 | (Jonathan Worthington)++ | src/core/Supply.pm

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Fix duplicate sending of done message

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo:

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The one-whenever supply/react optimized path was vulnerable to sending

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the `done` message twice, which it must not do if it's claiming to be

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: a protocol-following Supply. This fixes the double-vow crash reported

[11:01] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: in issue #1410.

[12:52] <nine> t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t seems to flap a lot more

[12:53] * lizmat saw it flap in her last spectest

[12:53] <lizmat> running one again

[12:55] * jnthn wonders if it's the newly added test

[12:56] <lizmat> You planned 83 tests but ran 69

[12:56] <lizmat> so I guess it's test 70

[12:56] <jnthn> Ah, then no

[13:00] <lizmat> ah, it seems to consistently fail now

[13:00] <lizmat> but apparently only under load

[13:01] <jnthn> Haven't seen it crash at all here

[13:01] <jnthn> Neither in spectest nor run on its own a bunch of times

[13:01] <lizmat> Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 12

[13:01] <lizmat> Access denied to keep/break this Promise; already vowed

[13:01] <lizmat> in block  at t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t line 543

[13:01] <jnthn> Do you have commit 2192ddd170?

[13:02] * lizmat doublechecks

[13:02] <lizmat> yes

[13:02] <jnthn> grmbl

[13:02] <jnthn> That fixed another case with the same error

[13:02] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/cafd72f89ee5a1ffd7fcc9b7d9f4f900

[13:03] <lizmat> what I do is run the spectest, and then repeatedly run that single file with --ll-exception

[13:03] <lizmat> in another window

[13:11] * masak .oO( "...don't do that, then!" ) :P

[13:12] <lizmat> jnthn: I've now got two stacktraces that differ (added it as a comment in the gist)

[13:13] <lizmat> where the trace differs, theres an ominous: # XXX Workaround for optimizer bug   comment

[13:14] <lizmat> also: SupplyOneWheneverTappable is in the trace, so looks like the new code is tickling a maybe already existing bug ?

[13:36] <timotimo> we should have a tiny piece of code that saves a backtrace of when a promise was vowed, when it was kept/rejected, and when it was attempted to be kept/rejected or vowed again

[13:37] <timotimo> for example with a wrap call

[13:40] * lizmat clickbaits https://www.perl.com/article/an-open-letter-to-the-perl-community/

[13:45] <tadzik> ++!

[13:45] <jnthn> Will look at that bug a bit later, fwiw; am working on something else at the moment :)
