[11:09] <tbrowder_> can anyone please tell me how to get a dump of the $/ in NQP?

[11:13] <jnthn> tbrowder_: Try callng .dump() on it

[11:14] <tbrowder_> i thought i did that...let me check

[11:17] <tbrowder_> yes, i tried “$/.dump(4)” and got msg like “SORRY cannot invoke..”

[11:20] <tbrowder_> i know i can get $<somename> objects from that $/ so it must be a real object. am i using right syntax?

[11:22] <jnthn> Hm, what's the 4? 

[11:22] <tbrowder_> indent

[11:22] <tbrowder_> i saw that on Cursor over in nqp repo

[11:22] <jnthn> ah, it looks optional though

[11:22] <tbrowder_> yes

[11:22] <jnthn> Though I doubt it's to do with that

[11:22] <jnthn> I suspect the dump code is in some way broken.

[11:22] <jnthn> Probably due to lack of use 

[11:23] <tbrowder_> heh, i sure need it

[11:23] <tbrowder_> can you spare a bit to take a look?

[11:30] <tbrowder_>  .ask moritz how much of your grammar book applies to nqp? i’ve found most of it does except for examing the $/ match object unless one knows apriori what one is looking for. or is nqp $/ introspection broken?

[11:30] <tbrowder_> .ask moritz ^^^

[11:35] <moritz> tbrowder_: most of the regex and grammar semantics are identical. The NQP match object offers less convenience though

[11:36] <tbrowder_> thnx, can you offer any way to pick apart an unknown $/?

[11:37] <tbrowder_> at the moment i’m just tryin $/[0] but still in compilation

[11:38] <moritz> tbrowder_: it has a dump() method

[11:38] <tbrowder_> that’s not working apparently

[11:39] <moritz> tbrowder_: are you by chance inspecting a match object of a failed match?

[11:39] <moritz> tbrowder_: that's another difference: in Perl 6, a failed match tends to return Nil, but in NQP it returns a match object with .from > .to

[11:41] <tbrowder_> i’ll have to look at my short test case, but i can try an nqp::defined on it, and also look at the ,from and .to

[11:41] <tbrowder_> got to go now but thnx for help

[11:47] <tbrowder_> moritz: i may have found prob, nqp doesn’t always have clear err msg, will report later

[11:53] <timotimo> perhaps $/ is NQPMu at that point

[11:53] <timotimo> oops, i was still scrolled up

[11:53] <timotimo> tbrowder_: can you check if perhaps $/ =:= NQPMu?

[11:53] <timotimo> oh, also

[11:53] <timotimo> the debugserver could be good here :)

[11:55] <timotimo> breakpoints and stepping aren't 100% reliable and easy to use in some situations

[11:55] <timotimo> but going through objects is fun & good

[12:35] <tbrowder_> ok, all is well, got $/.dump to work on nqp, but i have to golf it down to see basic use. (currently intermixed with other code)
