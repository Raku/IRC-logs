[08:47] *** lizmat left
[08:50] <lizmat_> Looks like the A::a() case is not handled by the static optimizer to codegen a callstatic

[08:50] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[08:51] <jnthn> But you can update what's in a package?

[08:52] <jnthn> So it's *not* static

[08:53] <lizmat> but the package has been closed at that point already ?

[08:53] <jnthn> Closed?

[08:53] <lizmat> or do you mean by augment?

[08:53] <jnthn> The Stash is just a Hash

[08:54] <jnthn> You can poke new things into it at any point

[08:55] <lizmat> I thought it was a Map ?

[08:55] <jnthn> m: say Stash.^mro

[08:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3cac14ec: OUTPUT: «((Stash) (Hash) (Map) (Cool) (Any) (Mu))␤»

[08:55] <lizmat> m: say PseudoStash.^mro

[08:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3cac14ec: OUTPUT: «((PseudoStash) (Map) (Cool) (Any) (Mu))␤»

[08:56] <jnthn> That one is, but you can't put stuff into one of those.

[08:56] <lizmat> guess that's where my confusion is from

[08:56] <jnthn> It largely walks lexical scopes, and those are immutable.

[08:57] <jnthn> Which is why that case is 16x faster :)

[08:57] <lizmat> hmmm... turning the sub into a method, makes it quite fast again

[08:58] <lizmat> m: cl;ass A { method a() {} }; for ^1_000_000 -> int $_ { A.a() }; say now - INIT now

[08:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3cac14ec: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5===␤Undeclared name:␤    A used at line 1␤Undeclared routines:␤    ass used at line 1. Did you mean 'abs'?␤    cl used at line 1. Did you mean 'lc'?␤␤Other potential difficulties:␤    Useless declaration of a has-scoped …»

[08:58] <jnthn> Yup, because those are looked up via the MOP where there are also much stronger rules than "it's just a Hash"

[08:58] <lizmat> m: class A { method a() {} }; for ^1_000_000 -> int $_ { A.a() }; say now - INIT now

[08:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3cac14ec: OUTPUT: «0.02996095␤»

[08:58] <lizmat> so why does that get so fast and the sub call doesn't ?

[08:59] <jnthn> Yup, because those are looked up via the MOP where there are also much stronger rules than "it's just a Hash"

[08:59] <lizmat> sorry, satellite lag

[08:59] <jnthn> I accounted for packet loss too ;)

[09:00] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[09:03] <jnthn> Anyway, I figure "it's slower to boot" can go on the long list of reasons to mostly avoid package scope for things other than package declarations themselves.

[16:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: ( no output )

[16:17] <TimToady> otgh we explicitly allow Nil to be used as a no-op without warning

[16:17] <TimToady> m: my $x = 0; Nil while $x++ < 10

[16:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: ( no output )

[16:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of constant integer 0 in sink context (use Nil instead to suppress this warning) (line 1)␤»

[16:18] <TimToady> but maybe we should only do that for literal Nil...

[16:18] <TimToady> well, I guess we already do

[16:19] <TimToady> m: BEGIN { 0 } if True

[16:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: ( no output )

[16:19] <TimToady> contrariwise, we don't propagate sink into BEGINs and such currently, though I suppose we could

[16:20] <TimToady> well, maybe we couldn't

[16:20] <TimToady> m: BEGIN { 0 } .say

[16:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[16:20] <TimToady> no, the BEGIN must fire off before we know whether the value is used

[16:21] <TimToady> best we could do is remember whether the last thing was side-effecty, and complain lazily later

[16:22] <TimToady> but anyway, we know a LEAVE is never going to give a useful value, so we could be a bit warnier on that

[16:25] <TimToady> m: LEAVE { say "done" } .foo.bar.baz.say

[16:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «Nil␤done␤»

[16:25] <TimToady> a little hard to imagine people using the Nil for something on purpose

[16:26] <AlexDaniel> TimToady: but that's not what I asked? My issue is LEAVE firing regardless of what you have in the statement modifier

[16:26] <TimToady> though nowhere else do we distinguish the sinks of 42; vs 42 if True

[16:27] *** robertle joined
[16:27] <TimToady> LEAVE doesn't work that way

[16:27] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[16:28] <TimToady> as jnthn points out, it installs the hook at compile time, before it even parses the 'if'

[16:29] <TimToady> the only place we cheat on that a bit is with my $handle will leave { .close } and such

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> yes, and shouldn't we have a warning if you do that? I guess I'm confused, but I don't see what it has to do with sink context…

[16:30] <TimToady> well, you're treating the LEAVE as if it's a side effect you can turn on or off

[16:31] <TimToady> but in the context of the expression, it's just a pseudo-constant that returns Nil

[16:33] <AlexDaniel> oh…

[16:34] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: tbrowder self-assigned POD data blocks / POD variables not yet implemented https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2242

[16:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «Use of Nil in numeric context␤0␤done␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤»

[16:34] <TimToady> that one warns

[16:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lizmat

[16:35] <TimToady> the place people usually get into trouble with this is by putting LEAVE as the last thing, and expecting it to return the value before

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> I just had a bug in my code where I misplaced a block a bit

[16:36] <AlexDaniel> `LEAVE { blah } if foo` instead of `LEAVE { blah if foo }`

[16:36] <TimToady> m: say { 42; LEAVE { say "done" } }() + 0

[16:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤done␤0␤Useless use of constant integer 42 in sink context (line 1)␤Use of Nil in numeric context␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤»

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> or `LEAVE blah if foo` :)

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> ;

[16:39] <TimToady> thing is, with Nil while $x++ < 10 we have the situation that we're explicitly not using a side effect in base expression because we want a side effect in the loop modifier

[16:39] <TimToady> so one could conceivably use LEAVE that way, though it would be misleading

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> yes

[16:39] <TimToady> m: LEAVE { say "done" } while $_++ < 10

[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «done␤»

[16:39] <TimToady> m: LEAVE { say "done" } while $_++ < 10; say $_

[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar db3768e35: OUTPUT: «11␤done␤»

[16:40] <TimToady> but I'm not sure we have to take such antisocial code into account in our design :)

[16:41] <jnthn> I suspect folks who write `LEAVE { stuff } if $blah` are more confused than antisocial :)

[16:41] <TimToady> I'd be perfectly happy saying "You may not use modifiers on exiting phasers, period."

[16:42] <TimToady> sure, it's usually confusion, but the language lawyers will argue with malice aforethought :)

[16:44] * TimToady is mostly just trying to think what the most awesome error message for it would be

[16:46] <TimToady> if we say "Useless use of statement modifier on phaser", we'll draw the "while $_++ < 10" "but it's not useless" whine periodically

[16:47] <TimToady> so I'm inclined to be a little less B and just say "You can't do that."
