[00:15] <AlexDaniel> fwiw looking at it again today I'm also puzzled by the current behavior of &say. I know that junctions are not always intuitive, but I'm expecting printing a .gist of something to do just that

[00:16] <AlexDaniel> I also don't understand the reasoning for this optimization: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6e0ac15e574cbeef22c06da2bd74816d71a46d41

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> adding a candidate so that calling .say a lot of times on a Str is faster? I'd say throw a sleep in there to make sure people don't use say for that purpose

[00:19] <AlexDaniel> that's a joke of course, but optimizing for misuse is perhaps not something we should be doing

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> .tell lizmat in case you need some extra uninformed opinions: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2018-02-27#i_15861908

[00:20] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[00:34] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: but you're calling say with the junction, and calling stuff with junctions usually autothreads

[00:45] <MasterDuke> my int @d = ^10; my int $m = 4; my int $p = 2; my int $BASE = 1000000000; @d[$m] = ((@d[$m] + $p * @d[$m-$p]) % $BASE); dd @d

[00:45] <evalable6> MasterDuke, rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «array[int].new(0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)␤»

[00:46] <MasterDuke> my int @d = ^10; my int $m = 4; my int $p = 2; my int $BASE = 1000000000; my int $a = @d[$m] + $p * @d[$m-$p]; @d[$m] = $a % $BASE; dd @d

[00:46] <evalable6> MasterDuke, rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «array[int].new(0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)␤»

[00:46] <MasterDuke> timotimo: for me (with the added print in the int,int candidate for infix:<%>, the second prints, but the first doesn't

[00:49] <MasterDuke> `say @d[$m] % $BASE` prints, but `say (@d[$m] + $m) % $BASE` does not

[00:49] <MasterDuke> `say ($m + $m) % $BASE` does

[00:52] <MasterDuke> so it's the native array

[00:53] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel`: +1 on removing special-casing for say Str. It always bothered me that "say prints a gist" has to be followed by "except on Str"

[00:53] <Zoffix> m: say <42> but role { method git { say "not-42" } }

[00:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[00:53] <Zoffix> Affects subclasses too

[00:53] <Zoffix> oh

[00:53] <Zoffix> m: say <42> but role { method gist { say "not-42" } }

[00:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[00:53] <Zoffix> yeah

[00:54] <Zoffix> m: say 42 but role { method gist { "not-42" } } # yes the same feature works for other types

[00:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «not-42␤»

[00:54] <Zoffix> s/yes/yet/;

[00:57] <Zoffix> timotimo: if we go by what's supposed to usually happen with Junction, then `say` should not thread, as it can take a Mu. So that fact that it still threads would be special-casing in that view.

[00:59] <Zoffix> We can have a very easy definition of say "equivalent to put of .gist"

[00:59] <Zoffix> And toss the special casing we have for Str and toss the special-casing we have for Junctions and it'll magically Do The Right Thing.

[01:00] <Zoffix> ZofBot: death to specialcases

[04:09] <MasterDuke> timotimo: if i just pull the array accesses out into their own native int variables, `e.g., my int $a = @d[$m]` and put those in the math expressions it goes from 1000s to 270s with the correct result

[06:57] <AlexDaniel`> timotimo: fair enough...

[08:29] <lizmat> .

[08:29] <yoleaux> 00:20Z <AlexDaniel> lizmat: in case you need some extra uninformed opinions: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-dev/2018-02-27#i_15861908

[08:30] <lizmat> AlexDaniel`: I'm not sure I understand the reason why you would be against special casing of Str:D in say

[08:30] <lizmat> m: say "the result is $score"

[08:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable '$score' is not declared␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3say "the result is 7⏏5$score"␤»

[08:31] <lizmat> say "the result is $score"   # feels like a pretty common "good" thing to do ?

[08:31] <AlexDaniel`> lizmat: not that I'm fully against, but it's a weird optimization to have in my opinion

[08:31] <lizmat> and since Str.gist returns self

[08:32] <AlexDaniel`> if "the result is $score" is called just once, what's the point of optimizing it?

[08:33] <lizmat> I bet there are a lot of programs out there that do a lot of "say"

[08:33] <lizmat> *and* every little bit helps

[08:33] <AlexDaniel`> and if it's called hundreds or thousands of times, then very likely it's a misuse of &say

[08:34] <lizmat> why?

[08:34] <AlexDaniel`> but no problem we can leave it there

[08:34] <AlexDaniel`> because a human is not going to read thousands of lines, this is very likely something produced for machines

[08:34] <lizmat> I don't see the misuse?

[08:34] <AlexDaniel`> and in that case &put should be used

[08:35] <lizmat> so we should take out the Str:D candidate for put ?

[08:35] <lizmat> the same reasoning holds there, I think

[08:36] <AlexDaniel`> huh?

[08:37] <AlexDaniel`> so &say is for humans, &put is for machines

[08:37] <lizmat> ?

[08:37] <AlexDaniel`> you don't agree with that?

[08:37] <AlexDaniel`> hmmm… let's see if we have it doc-ed somewhere

[08:37] * lizmat is confused now

[08:37] <AlexDaniel`> https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq#How_and_why_do_say,_put_and_print_differ?

[08:38] <AlexDaniel`> > But there's another difference: print and put converts its arguments to a string by calling the Str method on each item passed to, say uses the gist method instead. The former is meant for computers, the latter for human interpretation.

[08:39] <lizmat> well, it's nice that someone wrote this up like this, but I'm more in the liberal school here

[08:39] <lizmat> I don't assign a value to say / put or print

[08:40] <lizmat> they're all ways of outputting things

[08:40] <lizmat> in different ways

[08:40] <lizmat> you, as a user / developer, determine what is most appropriate for you

[08:41] <lizmat> "put" was a *very* late addition, that TimToady put in just before 6.c came out

[08:41] <lizmat> I would also say that "dd" is optimized for debugging, not "say"

[08:41] <lizmat> 1. because it does a .perl

[08:42] <lizmat> 2. it writes to STDERR, so it won't interfere with normal output

[08:42] <lizmat> 3. it does some extra to prevent hanging on some constructs that are infinite

[10:32] <|Tux|> test-t              2.600 -  2.601

[11:10] <Zoffix> "<lizmat> and since Str.gist returns self" that isn't guaranteed. The "little bit that helps" is at the cost of special-cased behavior that breaks custom Str and its subclasses

[11:10] <Zoffix> m: class Foo is Str { method gist { "just a foo" } }; say Foo

[11:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar abfbd1ab1: OUTPUT: «just a foo␤»

[11:10] <Zoffix> :(

[11:10] <Zoffix> m: class Foo is Str { method gist { "just a foo" } }; say Foo.new

[11:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar abfbd1ab1: OUTPUT: «␤»

[11:11] <Zoffix> There's no reasonable explanation for why Foo:D.gist stops using Foo.gist other than we stuck a special case to for minor performance gain

[11:13] <Zoffix> And the FAQ even says "The gist method, which you can also create for your own classes"

[11:16] <Zoffix> Nor does it explain why you can `say Mu` and get Mu.gist, but if you do `say Junction:D` you get… potentially no output at all. Why doesn't it just use Junction.gist and display that? Again, a special case for no other reason that it's mis-designed. (the special-casing for print/put can be argued that there's no non-threaded Junction.Str meaning [it returns a Junction] and the options are to thread or to

[11:16] <Zoffix> throw)

[11:17] <Zoffix> This shit's broken.

[11:22] <lizmat> well, then it has been broken for a *long* time

[12:33] <lizmat> https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Core-Infrastructure/events/247649657/   # not a word of Perl in there

[12:33] <|Tux|> where should I find "the problem" or is that syntax just wrong

[12:33] <lizmat> "we’re moving from monolith architecture to SOA"

[12:33] <AlexDaniel> oh, so that's a .pod6 failure?

[12:37] <|Tux|> AlexDaniel, your guess is better than mine :)

[12:38] <AlexDaniel> |Tux|: can you golf it?

[12:40] <|Tux|> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/Tux/0d0237b59882b69f66d5281642b1a145

[12:43] <lizmat> FWIW, since the NQP bump, I'm seeing a lot more flappers in spectest  :-(

[12:43] <AlexDaniel> |Tux|: ↑ why is that different?

[12:43] <lizmat> in weird places such as: S11-modules/perl6lib.t and t/spec/S16-io/put.t

[12:44] <lizmat> all of them "You planned N tests but ran 0"

[12:44] <AlexDaniel> ah shit, missing =

[12:44] <lizmat> which feels like a segfault somewhere along the way

[12:46] <|Tux|> This is Rakudo version 2018.02.1-47-g838782b7d built on MoarVM version 2018.02-6-g1849ae6d6

[12:46] <|Tux|> implementing Perl 6.c.

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> |Tux|: I think it just needs =begin pod and =end pod …

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> |Tux|: “Every Pod document has to begin with =begin pod and end with =end pod. Everything between these two delimiters will be processed and used to generate documentation.”

[12:52] <|Tux|> AlexDaniel, I think that .pod and .pod6 files could be exempt to that rule?

[12:53] <|Tux|> FWIW /me has no problem whatsoever in adding those two lines, but it feels kinda silly

[13:02] <lizmat> [Tux]: FWIW, in perl 5, .pod does not have a special meaning either, does it ?

[13:03] <|Tux|> no, but it does not require =begin pod and =end pod, as a strirting valid = (like =head1) *implies* that this is pod up to and including =cut

[13:04] <|Tux|> (or end-of-file)

[13:05] <lizmat> ah, on such a bicycle  :-)

[13:05] <|Tux|> :]

[13:05] <lizmat> I guess Perl 6 is more picky than that

[13:05] <|Tux|> that is why I posed the proposition

[13:06] <|Tux|> feel free to ignore. I added the =begin/end pod to that document

[14:57] <dogbert2_> stresstest was clean on my 32 bit vm

[15:52] <lizmat> m: sub a(\a) { a = 42 }; my int $a; a $a; say $a   # will this ever work ?

[15:55] <moritz> lizmat: I don't think so, because int is pass-by-value, not pass-by-reference

[15:56] <lizmat> m: sub a($a is rw) { $a = 42 }; my int $a; a $a; say $a   # but this works ?

[15:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 32b08035b: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[16:16] <[Coke]> I'm assuming that's getting boxed.

[16:16] <[Coke]> m: sub a($a is rw) { say $a.WHAT; $a=42}; my int $a; say $a.WHAT; a $a; say $a; say $a.WHAT

[16:16] <[Coke]> ... oh right, WHAT has to box it.

[16:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 32b08035b: OUTPUT: «0␤0␤42␤»

[16:17] <[Coke]> ... I don't know how to test my theory. :)

[22:19] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo: `my int @d = ^10; say @d[2] % @d[4];`, that should use the int,int candidate for infix:<%>, correct?

[22:20] <jnthn> Ideally, but I'm not sure we're quite there yet

[22:20] <MasterDuke> ah

[22:21] <MasterDuke> that would explain what i was seeing with rindolf's code

[22:21] <MasterDuke> "if i just pull the array accesses out into their own native int variables, `e.g., my int $a = @d[$m]` and put those in the math expressions it goes from 1000s to 270s with the correct result"

[22:57] <MasterDuke> jnthn: what needs to be done?

[23:19] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I'm not 100% sure, but I think at the very least we'd need to track known native arrays in the optimizer and understand accesses to them will give back native int/num/str

[23:22] <MasterDuke> static optimizer?

[23:28] <jnthn> Yes
