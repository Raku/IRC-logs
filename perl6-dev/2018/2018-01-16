[11:50] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix++ for running toaster, I usually do it 2 days before the release which is arguably too late :)

[11:55] <pmurias> is an 'Int' constraint in setting code a performance penalty or a benefit?

[11:55] <pmurias> we have erroneusly added int constraints in Date and I'm not sure if should remove them or turn them into Int?

[11:56] <timotimo> no impact, we already check for Any everywhere anyway

[11:58] <pmurias> so I should use an Int constraint?

[11:58] <timotimo> if you want an Int, then yes :)

[17:31] <[Coke]> I've asked this before, but should this generate a warning on stderr:

[17:31] <[Coke]> use IO::String; my $*ERR = IO::String.new; my $a; my $a;

[17:32] <[Coke]> you get a potential difficulty without the $*ERR shenanigans, but the compiler doesn't know about $*ERR, only stderr, so the warning still happens.

[17:33] <[Coke]> (that part of the compiler, anyway)

[17:35] <[Coke]> (this one is tricky because I think the difficulties are emitted at the end of the compile, but that is still before runtime $*ERR changes; the more reasonable one is when that's in an EVAL, which happened after the runtime $*ERR change.
