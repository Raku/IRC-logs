[20:43] <AlexDaniel> dogbert11: with or without my PR?

[20:43] <yoleaux> 15:24Z <dogbert11> AlexDaniel: the commit breaking Perl6::Parser is https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/46ef0ea08cae96db25c7b5a9543ba696034408c8

[22:33] <dogbert11> without unless it has been merged

[22:35] <dogbert11> perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem but all tests pass with the previous commit, i.e. 3365094f9ef
