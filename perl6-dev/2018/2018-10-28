[00:12] <AlexDaniel> I found another module!

[00:12] <AlexDaniel> not sure how it slipped previously, but it's a very new change

[00:14] <AlexDaniel> class with `scale` and `new` methods without return constraint: https://github.com/grondilu/clifford/blob/2c0ccd694db83ff279e638c89d9d2b5b5d3a01e1/lib/MultiVector/BitEncoded/Default.pm6#L8-L16

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> and here's the role: https://github.com/grondilu/clifford/blob/2c0ccd694db83ff279e638c89d9d2b5b5d3a01e1/lib/MultiVector.pm6#L4

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> and so the error message is “Multi method 'new' with signature :(MultiVector::BitEncoded::Default: Real $s, *%_ --> MultiVector) must be implemented by MultiVector::BitEncoded::Default because it is required by a role”

[00:16] <AlexDaniel> and that bisected to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/abba67b2281c57abf2e8a4933455a8cd3f5a26ab

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> m: role Foo { multi method new() returns MultiVector {...} }; class Bar does Foo { method new() {} }

[00:18] <AlexDaniel> that

[00:18] <AlexDaniel> I guess a PR is needed for that module

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> although… how to achieve what the author meant?

[00:20] <AlexDaniel> ah, just make both `returns Foo`

[14:16] <nine> constantly failing...so I guess it's my branch

[23:00] <AlexDaniel> that took some time 😅

[23:04] <timotimo> cool, a release!

[23:08] <timotimo> should the 6pad project be linked a bit more directly?

[23:09] <timotimo> we don't have a bot to find commits by hash for us, right?

[23:10] <timotimo> maybe the line for 6edb142f should also mention IO::Handle, and maybe that line and the next one could be turned into one?

[23:12] <timotimo> Added skip-one method to appropriate PredictiveIterators [e54885e5]

[23:12] <timotimo> should probably have ` ` around PredictiveIterator

[23:13] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: mind if i make these changes and one more?

[23:13] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: mmmm, how?

[23:14] <AlexDaniel> I mean, the release is out

[23:14] <timotimo> ah

[23:14] <timotimo> well, we can still make little changes after the release is out, IMO

[23:14] <timotimo> for posterity's sake

[23:14] <AlexDaniel> as for ` `, I used to only add quotes if there was something markdown-like

[23:14] <AlexDaniel> this release though it was a bit different

[23:14] <AlexDaniel> still not the end of the world :)

[23:15] <timotimo> no, it's good :)

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> as for linking 6pad, I wanted to but then realized there's no README… I guess I should've linked to https://perl6.github.io/6pad/

[23:15] <timotimo> yeah we could do that

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> and I just don't understand how that could've happened

[23:44] <timotimo> i just "git pull"ed in all three repos and got no error messages

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> I guess bots will feel a bit bad for a few minutes until it recovers

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> but hmmm this is weird

[23:46] <geekosaur> likewise, just pulled all repos, no error

[23:52] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar a4e7e8ed9: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> so that's fine now… but what the hell

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> it felt like a force push or something like that, but that looked like my own merge was the issue

[23:53] <AlexDaniel> and given that I didn't do it, I have no explanation :S

[23:57] <MasterDuke> timotimo: line directives?
