[14:24] <tbrowder___> here’s a question fo grammar experts: in Rakudo Grammar.nqp there are several instances of “<pod_content=.pod_textcontent>**0..1” and TimToady said the **0..1 forces the object to be an array. Both “pod_content” and “pod_textcontent” are tokens and both have methods in Actions.nqp. I think the “.token” construct means the match isn’t to be saved but does it still trigger the action method?

[14:25] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[14:27] <tbrowder___> my guess is no, but i have no proof yet

[14:30] <geekosaur> mm, iirc it means it's not saved as both pod_content and pod_textcontent. I would thnk action methods still fire, it just doesn't get saved twice in the final Match object

[19:32] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[19:33] <samcv> that's on Perl 5. so it prints it out the bits stored for a 64 bit integer

[19:35] <samcv> so basically our %b is 100% broken because it doesn't print things out as the exact 64 bit bits the computer stores them as. or our %b implementation works like our other integer format prints and is just a plain number and not two's complement notation

[19:36] <timotimo> is sprintf able to differentiate between an int and an Int being passed?

[19:36] <yoleaux> 18:22Z <Zoffix> timotimo: IIRC you worked on async socks in the past. Would you be able to review and merge https://github.com/perl6/nqp/pull/505 ?

[19:36] <yoleaux> 18:30Z <Kaiepi> timotimo: don't merge the asyncsocket op pullreqs yet, i need to tweak it a bit so it'll actually be possible to get the fd of sockets in the jvm later on

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> hah

[19:45] <Kaiepi> timotimo: should be good for review now
