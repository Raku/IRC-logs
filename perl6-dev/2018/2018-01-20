[00:05] <tbrowder> and i’ve answered my own question about (my $a) vs. my ($a): scopes are the same (duh), just didn’t recognize it as it was written!

[00:15] <tbrowder> .ask AlexDaniel can you define a branch of rakudo where the pod slang work can be done so my work can be merged by PR more readily? or should i just do it on my own acc’t in isolation? or?

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> quotable6: ‘.markdown’

[12:16] <quotable6> AlexDaniel, OK, working on it! This may take up to three minutes (4482999 messages to process)

[12:17] <quotable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/eb39d5949aa19e3e882a134915bd8c4e

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: regarding the branch, feel free to do it the way you like. If your CLA arrived already, then you should have a commit bit, and then you can work in a branch of an upstream repo

[12:18] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: I see that the supernova project was supposed to work independently for the initial stages, but the long term plan was to move it to guts

[12:19] <tbrowder> roger

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: tbh I know very little about POD and even less so about supernova, so use your own judgement

[12:19] <tbrowder> thnx, i’ll try hard to justify yr faith...

[12:20] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: also, I think you shouldn't be expecting this to be merged within v6.c because I'm sure that it will result in a lot of changed behavior

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: so the merge will probably happen for the next language version once it's ready. Like v6.e or v6.d it happens that it takes us so much time for v6.d…

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> if it*

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: but yeah, I'm very happy that someone is looking in this direction

[12:22] <tbrowder> yep, i expected that. i’m certainly not going to be able to do it anytime soon!

[12:26] <tbrowder> but actually i think it may be mostly backwardly compatible.

[12:28] <tbrowder> we have tightened the ascii table requirements almost to hers (more in some cases), and the formatting codes inside tables have just been ignored.

[12:29] <tbrowder> her new fancy unicode tables will be shocking but definitelya show-off

[12:39] <stmuk> I started this https://github.com/stmuk/rakudo-packages a few months back which maybe should go in docs/website somewhere

[12:39] <stmuk> any idea where though?

[13:02] <psch> stmuk: perl6.org/downloads and rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo seem most fitting

[13:02] <psch> although the latter already is quite extensive with instructions...

[13:02] <stmuk> both probably have too much information there anyway

[13:04] <psch> maybe a link on perl6.org/downloads under the "Installing from binaries" header?

[13:04] <psch> i.e. "Alternative there are [these](...) community-maintained packages for some GNU/Linux distributions"

[13:04] <stmuk> yes that's a good idea

[13:50] <tbrowder> lizmat: thnx!

[14:10] <psch> 9 million lines profiling output /o\

[14:10] <psch> i suppose i shouldn't have put two of those into vimdiff without checking their size

[14:12] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: i sent the CLA several weeks ago. i tried, through the web interface, to create a rakudo branch, but no recognition of my git user name. i can create a branch in nqp because moritz gave me the perl6 commit bit early on when i was pushing doc PRs.

[14:13] <psch> IIRC my CLA approval took around 6 weeks?

[14:13] <psch> that's ~4 years ago though

[14:14] <tbrowder> btw, what’s the feeling about adding one’s git user name to a branch name?

[14:14] <psch> but github/perl6 isn't bound by the CLA like github/rakudo is i also seem to remember

[14:14] <moritz> that's correct

[14:15] <tbrowder> ok, how will the rakudo owners know about my CLA?

[14:15] <tbrowder> is there a list? should i query them directly?

[14:16] <psch> i *think* PerlJam did the correspondence in my case?  i.e. bugged TPF people about my CLA and then mentioned it here when it had arrived

[14:16] <tbrowder> ok, thnx, i’ll bug TPF then...

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> maybe it's a good idea to ping [Coke] first?

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: using your username as a branch name is just fine

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> although I'd prefer “new-pod” or something like that :)

[14:20] <tbrowder> i was thinking something like pod-slang-tbrowder

[14:20] <psch> +1 on feature-named branches

[14:21] <psch> no real idea whether a username adds anything, but it probably also doesn't take anything away

[14:23] <tbrowder> .ask [Coke] can please check on my CLA application? (Thomas M. Browder, Jr.; aka Tom Browder)

[14:23] <yoleaux> tbrowder: I'll pass your message to [Coke].

[14:26] <tbrowder> ref branch names: i just see other names as part of branches and it seems to provide a quick ref to who “owns” it (i.e., the guilty party)

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> but it's also possible to look at the last commits so that's hardly a problem

[14:29] <psch> i mean, if tbrowder starts the trend we'll know their branches at a glance at least :)

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> :D

[14:37] <DrForr> . o ( CLA application? Something I've missed due to fallout? )

[14:37] <psch> DrForr: contributors license agreement.  pushing directly to the rakudo repo needs a waiver for the artistic license

[14:37] <psch> DrForr: and TPF wants to have that in writing, 'cause legal stuff probably

[14:38] <DrForr> Ah.

[14:45] <psch> hm, pretty much everything seems to just straight double on the heap with two vs one EvalServer calls using &run

[14:45] <psch> i'm not sure that's surprising or to be expected :S

[18:26] * AlexDaniel goes for a nap

[18:26] <AlexDaniel> possibly a very long nap, see you all tomorrow o/

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> hmmm I think something is wrong with WHICH

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> releasable complains

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I'm seeing some weird fresh failures in toaster, tomorrow will be trying to figure it out

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> maybe a non-issue because things look… weird

[22:44] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/17c428ef80f077e146d7784661a40b9a

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> .tell Zoffix “is NaN.Rat, NaN, "NaN.Rat == NaN";” needs a similar change in 6.c-errata branch, I'm assuming there's a justification for that?

[22:49] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[22:53] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[23:23] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: it's weird these are popping for you, 'cause I thought I fixed all 6.c-errata breakage other than the list type object..

[23:23] <Zoffix> Perhaps I just lost these failures under the sea of TODO passage

[23:25] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: but yeah, those tests are incorrect. They're using string equality (due to use of `is` routine) to test numeric equality of two objects.

[23:25] <Zoffix> m: dd NaN.Rat.isNaN

[23:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar b41a9176a: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[23:25] <Zoffix> That NaN fudge was removed in later commit

[23:31] <Zoffix> 6c: say NaN.Rat.Num

[23:31] <committable6> Zoffix, ¦6c (26 commits): «NaN␤»

[23:31] <Zoffix> Str view of Rat involves division and only in Num view is division by zero is not an explosion

[23:57] <Zoffix> As for the change itself. In 2017.12, we had NaN.Rat return a special non-Rat object that knew how to convert back to NaN and did not explode with stringification. Now, we simply return an effective inverse operation: <0/0>.Num => NaN; NaN.Rat => <0/0>. This fixed 3 bugs with the old system and my log digging showed me that the original special-object thing was a misinterpretation. Full description is in
