[15:21] <jnthn> That's I guess another benefit :)

[15:22] <jnthn> A run of a benchmark I'm looking at took 2.993 before and 2.784 after that

[15:23] <timotimo> wow, that's worth a lot

[15:23] <jnthn> yes, on that particular benchmark it was the difference between being slower than Ruby and being as fast as Ruby :P

[15:25] <timotimo> cool

[15:25] <timotimo> but ruby is pretty slow, isn't it?

[15:25] <jnthn> Depends on the benchmark

[15:25] <timotimo> i guess that's always true :)

[15:26] <jnthn> I've a utf-8 million lines reading benchmark where we beat Perl 5 and Python but Ruby wins on that one. :)
