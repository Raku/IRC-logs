[03:35] <Zoffix> What exactly controls whether last line of a `for` loop gets sunk? I thought I saw something somewhere, but failing to find it now.

[03:51] <ZofBot> Zoffix, He teased and bullied the other children in a way that is characteristic of the high-grade imbecile

[04:23] <Zoffix> nm, I think I was thinking of something else. The sinkage is done by &unwanted

[04:40] <Zoffix> m: class Foo { method sink { say "sunk" }; method foo { self } }; Foo.foo for ^1

[04:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7c1a6cac7: OUTPUT: «sunk␤»

[04:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7c1a6cac7: ( no output )

[04:40] <Zoffix> Wonder if there's a reason return value of subs don't get sunk of it's just an oversight

[04:49] <Zoffix> I guess we're in a for a perf drop.

[04:52] <Zoffix> m: class Foo { method sink { say "sunk" }; method foo { self } }; sub foo { Foo }; foo

[04:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7c1a6cac7: ( no output )

[05:46] <Zoffix> The whole "`for` is a .map" thing needs to go, I think

[08:52] <timotimo> damn, this "take returns its argument, and that may get sunk" thing doesn't sound like a thing we want

[13:00] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: when dealing with spam tickets in RT, please hit the "S" button in the upper right hand corner. I am of the impression that this will help track spam so future tickets might not need human intervention (but maybe it just deletes them, I don't know for sure.)

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I always do

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> but reportable does not track deletions so I have to delete stuff manually from its memory :(

[13:01] * AlexDaniel also deletes spam on https://fail.rakudo.party/

[13:01] <[Coke]> I was looking at https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132911 which still had the S button for me in the original grey state, and shows you as deleting it; I was able to hit the S button and turn it red.

[13:02] <AlexDaniel> hmmmmm I did exactly that

[13:02] <[Coke]> refreshing, I see it's still red, but my action isn't in the history. ah well.

[13:02] <AlexDaniel> I think it autodeletes the ticket when you press that button

[13:02] <AlexDaniel> as for why it's not showing red when someone else pressed it – I don't know

[13:02] <[Coke]> nevermind me, then. And I'll probably tell you again in 18 months when I've forgotten. :)

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> that's ok! Although in 18 months we might need to reassess the status of the RT and how we use it :)

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> we have ≈3 new RT tickets every week

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> (but sometimes none)

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> and ≈30 new tickets every week on github

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> wait what… really?

[13:06] <AlexDaniel> yes :O

[17:39] <Zoffix> So we can save 8% of performance by training our users not to have statements that have to be sunk as last statement of `for` loops.

[17:39] <Zoffix> I mean, that's exactly how you'd expect it to behave if it were the last statement of a .map's block.

[22:10] <[Coke]> O_o . o O (NO WAY!)

[22:19] <Zoffix> lizmat++ # good weekly

[22:22] <Zoffix> timotimo: RE https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2018/02/msg4677.html  a few days ago I mentioned that it's a bug (and wanted to fix it, but was sidetracked). `say` is meant to call .gist and Junction.gist does return the `all(...)` string. Also `say` is often used to dump iffy stuff (like type objects) that don't quite stringify and having `say all()` produce absolutely no output kinda

[22:22] <Zoffix> violates its behaviour of producing a "gist" of a thing. So the change to `say` should be reverted and only .put/.print/.printf should thread them

[22:23] <Zoffix> And there are proptests that need to be changed too

[22:25] <Zoffix> c: HEAD~1000 print 1|2

[22:25] <committable6> Zoffix, ¦HEAD~1000: «This type cannot unbox to a native string: P6opaque, Junction␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/ud6AM6FR2y line 1␤␤ «exit code = 1»»

[22:25] <Zoffix> 'cause this is what we were actually trying to fix at the time

[22:32] <lizmat> well, but will that fix something like:

[22:32] <lizmat> m: say "a" ~ "b"|"c"

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «ab␤c␤»

[22:32] <lizmat> m: say "a" ~ ("b"|"c")

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «ab␤ac␤»

[22:32] <lizmat> m: say ("a" ~ ("b"|"c")).perl

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «any("ab", "ac")␤»

[22:33] <lizmat> perhaps Junction.gist should just be the same as Junction.perl ?

[22:33] <Zoffix> m: say ("a" ~ ("b"|"c")).gist

[22:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «any(ab, ac)␤»

[22:33] <Zoffix> Right now say(Junction) doesn't use Junction.gist

[22:34] <Zoffix> m: dd "a" ~ ("b"|"c")

[22:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «any("ab", "ac")␤»

[22:34] <lizmat> aah

[22:34] <lizmat> ok

[22:35] <lizmat> still I think this is a bad idea

[22:35] <Zoffix> lizmat: why?

[22:36] <lizmat> m: my $j = any(<a b c>); say "foo$j"  # you want this to thread

[22:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «fooa␤foob␤fooc␤»

[22:36] <lizmat> with your proposal, it would say "any("fooa", "foob", "fooc")"

[22:37] <Zoffix> lizmat: why do I want that to thread? I want the .gist of an object, which in this case is a Junction. If I want to thread and print three strings, I'll use `put`

[22:38] <lizmat> it feels to me that it is magic that saying a Junction won't thread

[22:38] <lizmat> a  bit of a WAT

[22:38] <lizmat> and not a DWIM

[22:39] <lizmat> it makes the use of Junctions inconsistent, is my feeling

[22:39] <lizmat> (gut feeling)

[22:39] <lizmat> if you *know* it's going to be a Junction and you're using "say" for debugging, use dd

[22:40] <Zoffix> The DWIM here is to print the .gist. In fact, the magic here is that Junction threads, since it shouldn't as there is a Mu candidate for say.

[22:40] <lizmat> m: my $j = any(<a b c>); dd "foo$j"

[22:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «any("fooa", "foob", "fooc")␤»

[22:40] <Zoffix> lizmat: but say "prints the gist". In this case it doesn't

[22:41] <lizmat> is there a Mu candidate for say ?

[22:41] <Zoffix> It only benefits the people who abuse `say` and use it instead of using `put`.

[22:41] <Zoffix> m: say Mu

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

[22:41] <Zoffix> m: [any(),any(),any(),any(),].say

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «[any() any() any() any()]␤»

[22:41] <Zoffix> ^ those are actual .gist's of Junction.

[22:41] <Zoffix> m: [any(),any(),any(),any(),]».say

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: ( no output )

[22:42] <Zoffix> But ^ if you try to say them individually, you get no output at all, not even newlines. That's a deviation for .say's behaviour.

[22:43] <Zoffix> And I can counter-argue the "you're using "say" for debugging, use dd" with: if you want to thread and print strings, use the string-printing routines, not the .gist printing routine

[22:43] <lizmat> well, let me put it this way: what's the difference between say / put / note ?

[22:43] <lizmat> say / note output .gist, on stdout / stderr respectivly

[22:44] <lizmat> put outputs .Str on stdout

[22:44] <Zoffix> right

[22:44] <lizmat> that's easy to explain

[22:44] <Zoffix> Indeed. But that's not the current behaviour.

[22:44] <lizmat> now, we're only going to special case 'say' wrt to threading, and not "note" and "put" ?

[22:45] <Zoffix> No, we're only going to special-case `put` wrt to threading and make it thread, despite having Mu candidate. For `say` and `note` we'll remove the Junction special-case and let them output .gist of Junctions. Exactly how you described the behaviour above

[22:46] <Zoffix> and print

[22:47] <lizmat> is that @Larry's opinion ?

[22:47] <Zoffix> "<lizmat> say / note output .gist" <-- they don't right now. If I do $junction-object := 1|2; say $junction-object. I'm NOT going to get `put $junction-object.gist`

[22:47] <Zoffix> No one replied when I mentioned this a few days ago. So far the only opinions I heard are mine and yours

[22:51] <lizmat> Zoffix: well, my coverage of the channel is sketchy at best at the moment

[22:52] <Zoffix> m: dd any(42e0).Str; dd any(42e0).gist

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «any("42")␤"any(42)"␤»

[22:53] <lizmat> m: dd any(42e0).Str.^name

[22:53] <Zoffix> And it makes sense if thought this ^ way. Junction.Str (used by `put`) returns a Junction of strings, so if you print them they thread, but Junction.gist (supposed to be used by `say`) returns a single string, so there's no threading in output

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 838782b7d: OUTPUT: «"Junction"␤»

[22:53] <lizmat> ok, let me sleep on that a bit

[22:54] <lizmat> :-)

[22:54] <lizmat> we have some days for the next release, right ?

[22:54] <Zoffix> Plenty

[22:54] <Zoffix> releasable6: next

[22:54] <releasable6> Zoffix, Next release in 18 days and ≈20 hours. Blockers: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22%E2%9A%A0+blocker+%E2%9A%A0%22. Changelog for this release was not started yet

[22:54] <lizmat> ok, then I'm calling it a day now

[22:54] <Zoffix> \o

[22:54] <lizmat> good night, #perl6-dev!

[23:04] <timotimo> Zoffix: OK, should i point that out on that thread?

[23:12] <Zoffix> timotimo: yeah, maybe a good idea to say that this is something that ain't part of 6.c spec and we're still trying to figure out what the actual behaviour should be. Using `put $junction.perl` should give the result they want before and after the changes (put $junction.gist would work right now too; dunno what are the chances of that changing)

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> heh, re https://twitter.com/andrewshitov/status/966039628049416192 – there was an idea of making a compiler that does nothing useful except passing roast

[23:26] <Zoffix> Would be nice to have one to see how well roast defines a useful compiler :)

[23:30] <timotimo> agreed

[23:30] <Zoffix> OTOH you can just make a compiler that ignores files and prints "1..1\n1 ok" :)

[23:50] <timotimo> implement it in asm and it'll be blazing fast
