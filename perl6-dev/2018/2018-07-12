[12:40] <lizmat> so I'm thinking of making this die:

[12:41] <lizmat> m: my %h is Map = a => 42; %h = b => 666; dd %h

[12:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2bbe3f0a: OUTPUT: «Map.new((:b(666)))␤»

[12:41] <lizmat> in other words, a Map can only be initialized once, and from there on out, cannot be initialized again

[12:42] <lizmat> one way of doing this, would be to give Hash its own STORE method

[12:42] <lizmat> which would remove the need for having a STORE_AT_KEY semi-official interface method

[12:42] <lizmat> jnthn moritz timotimo Zoffix ^^^  suggestions / comments ?

[12:44] <jnthn> huh, I thought Map already wasn't assignable?

[12:44] * jnthn is surprised

[12:44] <lizmat> it's not assignable but it is initializable

[12:44] <lizmat> yeah, just found out about it

[12:44] <lizmat> m: my %h is Map = a => 42; %h<a> = 666

[12:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2bbe3f0a: OUTPUT: «Cannot change key 'a' in an immutable Map␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:44] <lizmat> m: my %h is Map = a => 42; %h<c> = 666

[12:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2bbe3f0a: OUTPUT: «Cannot add key 'c' to an immutable Map␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:44] <lizmat> that all stops you from changing, but:

[12:45] <lizmat> m: my %h is Map = a => 42; %h = b => 666; dd %h  # just works  :-(

[12:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2bbe3f0a: OUTPUT: «Map.new((:b(666)))␤»

[12:45] <lizmat> jnthn: anyways, so you think the current behaviour is a bug
