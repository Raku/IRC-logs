[13:18] <jnthn> Notice how it things that the 42 is uselessly used

[13:18] <jnthn> *thinks

[13:18] <jnthn> Both when it worked and now

[13:18] <jnthn> Anyway, the bluff has been called in HEAD.

[13:19] <jnthn> Since it sees the return value of the loop isn't used, it does an invoke_v

[13:19] <jnthn> That causes the result of the block to not be stored

[13:20] <jnthn> And then the value is missing for the frame exit handler

[13:23] <jnthn> I think I'll fix it over in MoarVM by making the value available for the exit handler differently, irrespective of if the caller wants it.

[19:05] <MasterDuke> ah

[19:07] *** lizmat left
[19:10] <MasterDuke> pmurias: does the mini-setting truffle uses override the main setting?

[19:12] <MasterDuke> i.e., if truffle can now parse/implement the regular say(), should the mini-say() be removed?

[19:12] <MasterDuke> or instead made to match the regular implementation?

[19:13] <pmurias> MasterDuke: the mini-setting is hack untill we can load the regular one

[19:14] *** Kaiepi left
[19:15] <pmurias> MasterDuke: it should match the regular implementation till we load the main one (we will remove the main setting then)

[19:16] <pmurias> * remove the mini setting then

[20:08] <MasterDuke> i spent way to long trying to figure out what was going on

[20:10] <MasterDuke> now to try and remember what test that lets truffle run...

[20:18] *** AlexDaniel joined
[20:19] <MasterDuke> pmurias: while i try to figure that out, how difficult do you think 'return' will be to implement?

[20:27] <pmurias> MasterDuke: return works by throwing an exception in Perl6

[20:28] <pmurias> MasterDuke: test 006 wants a multi argument say

[20:29] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I think using Java exceptions for that should work

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> .

[20:37] <pmurias> MasterDuke: the hard part of return is that throwpayloadlex traverses scopes lexically (it looks in the outer not caller scope for handlers)

[20:37] <MasterDuke> pmurias++ 006 it was

[20:38] <pmurias> I'm to sleepy right now to figure out the best way to do that traversal ;)

[20:39] <MasterDuke> heh

[20:39] <pmurias> MasterDuke: test 14 looks like something fairly easily doable (if we skip the jvm backend check)

[20:40] <MasterDuke> a simple return complains that 'handlepayload' is unimplemented, but i doubt that's all that's needed

[20:41] *** brrt left
[20:46] <pmurias> MasterDuke: you can use --target=ast to print QAST stuff

[20:46] <pmurias> MasterDuke: throwpayloadlex and handlepayload work together to make return work

[20:51] <MasterDuke> 014-while.t needs `callmethod`. oh, but that's just for the jvm backend check
