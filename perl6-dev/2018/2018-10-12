[08:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 341190e28: OUTPUT: «main␤goodbye␤»

[08:26] <lizmat> https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#sub_MAIN states "The sub with the special name MAIN is executed after all relevant phasers."

[08:27] <lizmat> either "LEAVE" is not relevant, or the doc is wrong or there's something else amiss

[08:31] <geekosaur> seems badly phrased to me; I think it wants to say that it's run after all the appropriate phasers for entering the scope in which it's contained.

[08:32] <geekosaur> which leaves two questions: (1) it's specific abotu entering, why not exiting that scope? (2) when does it run relative to runnable code in that scope?

[08:33] <geekosaur> ((2) might be answered in a different part, I haven't looked)

[08:35] <geekosaur> then again, if it means actually after all the ophasers fr that scope, then the behavior does nto match the docs. and someone needs tothink about thatbehavor, because I'd expect a LEAVE phaser to be used for e.g. cleaning up resources --- but I'd expect those resources to be available when MAIN is run
