[22:07] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what's the meaning of https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/a291e7f024ba2408c53f1ae7059cdc55fca444be ? It says “todo” without a comment, so that is transformed to `todo();` which doesn't compile at all because there's no multi like that. A fix to that is `#?rakudo todo "some description here"`, but why is the TODO left there at all?

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> is that because you wanted older rakudos to pass these tests? Has anybody even checked that lately? :)

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: then there's t/spec/S03-operators/bag.t that fails a bunch of tests. Basically it does ($baghash ∪ $baghash) and expects it to be Bag but on HEAD it's BagHash. I guess these tests can be fixed to check for Baggy instead?

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: same goes for t/spec/S03-operators/mix.t and t/spec/S03-operators/set.t

[22:37] <jnthn> So far as I can tell, it's always been like that

[22:40] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: re https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/a291e7f024ba2408c53f1ae7059cdc55fca444be , what todo are you talking about?

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: the commit adds `#?rakudo todo`. When the test file is fudged, that todo is transformed into `todo();`

[22:41] <lizmat> so a reason MUST be added ?

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yes

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: you can check that by checking out 6.c-errata in t/spec, and then running this `perl t/spec/fudgeandrun S02-literals/quoting.t`

[22:42] <lizmat> ah... hmmm... somehow I had it in my mind that that was ok

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: so what's the meaning of this commit then: (2016-03-15) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b243a9663273bf3f82c51109ab0eff9556d2177e

[22:42] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: fwiw, I got a MoarVM patch already for this; I was testing the above here to make sure my test case blows up prior to the fix

[22:42] <lizmat> as the same is done for the niecza case

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> ah alright

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> jnthn++

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yeah, I've noticed that too. But maybe `todo` was different in niecza? I don't know.

[22:43] <jnthn> That patch was just moving the setting of the debug name to apply to all types, not just classes

[22:44] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: by the way, have you seen the fix for R#2231 ?

[22:44] <synopsebot_> R#2231 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2231 [SEGV][regression][⚠ blocker ⚠] SEGV in Audio::Sndfile

[22:44] <AlexDaniel> I mean, the way the module was fixed

[22:46] <jnthn> ah no, not yet

[22:47] <jnthn> I saw that the author was going to look

[22:47] <jnthn> Then went for dinner, homework, etc. :)

[22:55] <jnthn> Hmm...interesting

[22:56] <jnthn> I wonder if that's "valgrind is happy but it leaks"
