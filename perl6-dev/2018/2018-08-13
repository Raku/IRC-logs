[10:10] <jnthn> This has rather broken a (quite large, private) Perl 6 application I work on

[10:10] <jnthn> But at least I could golf it fairly quick and we caught it pre-release

[10:11] <jnthn> Though I'm now very curious why I'm ending up in Hash.Map

[10:12] <jnthn> The code in question looks like make Foo.new(|flat($<bar>.map(*.ast)).Map)

[10:12] <jnthn> Where .ast returns a Pair

[10:12] <jnthn> The change breaks this since if the value gets itemized then nested Iterable things will not bind correct to an @!foo attribute in Foo

[10:13] <jnthn> But the thing I have from flat(...) is a Seq
