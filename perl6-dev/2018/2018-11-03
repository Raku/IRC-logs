[00:21] <Zoffix> .tell samcv I've logged unicode changes as "- Expanded specification coverage of Unicode routines and features - Upgraded coverage to Unicode version 11" and will log $*COLLATION and any new routines I see. So I guess it's logged now, but feel free to make it more specific. I plan to have ChangeLog in completed form by Nov 3. ~11PM EST

[00:27] <jnthn> Zoffix: Did the tests for $CALLER:_ / CALLER::<$_> get dropped in 6.d?

[00:28] <jnthn> Ah, I see them in APPENDICES/A03-older-specs/01-misc.t

[00:28] <jnthn> Which does use v6.c. OK :)

[07:46] <stmuk> We refer a lot in announcements to "Rakudo Perl 6", I'm not sure "Rakudo Raku" is a sensible replacement, if the Raku alias is used maybe we should remove some (but not all Perl 6) references

[07:49] <stmuk> does Raku (or another alias) refer just to 6.d or 6.c (retrospectively)

[13:03] <Zoffix> stmuk_: I wouldn't worry about trying to use "Raku" anywhere core at the moment. Let it start with 3rd-party users and blog writers. The alias is to the name of the language, not to any particular version. Also, I've not heard from TimToady on his final-final decision yet; he did say Raku was the top pick, but there were no final statements yet

[13:03] <yoleaux> 06:22Z <holyghost> Zoffix: I've added Mathx::Stat to github.com/theholyghost2, it compiles and needs tests

[13:03] <yoleaux> 06:27Z <holyghost> Zoffix: as I'm busy with personal things next week, I'll manage compiles for Bayes::Learn, Game::Markov, AI::Agent next week starting from wednesday

[13:05] <Zoffix> stmuk_: and "Rakudo Perl 6" is from the time when we were trying to further differentiate Perl 6 from "[Pumpkin] Perl 5", so the new version would be "Raku Perl 6", not "Rakudo Raku"

[13:05] <Zoffix> Or just Raku or just Perl 6

[13:09] <Zoffix> (I guess there's also "Rakudo Perl 6 Compiler", which can just stay as that, IMO)

[13:55] <nine> I kinda like how one can read Rakudo as Raku-do. While Raku is just a language, Raku-do makes it _do_ things

[13:56] <Zoffix> I think there's also some Japanese meaning of `-do`. Like "way of Raku" or something

[13:57] <stmuk_> "raku" is growing on me with "Perl 6"/"Perl6" "Perl&nbsp;6" seeming quite clumsy and overlong

[20:18] <TimToady> have we yet done anything about aggregating role submethods like BUILD and TWEAK and calling all of them?  Seems like a 6d transition sort of thing to think about...

[20:20] <lizmat> you mean like R#1679 ?

[20:20] <synopsebot> R#1679 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1679 [regression] BUILDPLAN sharing optimization appears to have broken ancestor attribute initialization

[20:21] <TimToady> no, I mean where the roles have explicit submethods that they'd like to call to initialize their part of the object

[20:22] * lizmat is not sure

[20:22] <TimToady> my understanding is that currently they're ignored, or collide, and in any case not called

[20:23] <TimToady> whereas I think there was a general consensus that they should just all be called along with the class's associated submethod

[20:23] <TimToady> (probably before, given they're vaguely ancestral)

[20:23] <TimToady> well, presumably a DESTROY submethod would come after, for similar reasons

[20:25] <TimToady> anyway, just askin' if this is a good time to ask :)

[20:26] * lizmat is again not sure :-(

[20:49] <b2gills> Looks like any `only submethod BUILD` in a class overrides one coming from a role, but multis mixing in.

[20:50] <lizmat> .ask jnthn looking at the HYPER() structure: I wonder whether it would be an idea to create a Hyper class that would keep the op / dwim-left / dwm-right as attributes so they wouldn't have to be passed around all of the time ?
