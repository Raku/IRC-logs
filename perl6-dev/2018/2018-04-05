[11:58] <Zoffix> dogbert2: it's fun if all you play it for just blowing random stuff up, but it basically has no story. The villains are hipsters with bibles and when you do X random things to fill up your "resistance" bar, you just basically teleport to the villain (it's ridiculous; can happen even in the middle of doing a side quest). Out of the three villains I had any major interactions with: Faith was awesome. She

[11:58] <Zoffix> really sold me the idea of this cult and why it's awesome. But the other two brothers were awful. They each gave me a sob story about getting beaten by parents and getting left behind in Iraq or something on our first meeting and I was just screaming at the monitor "Why are you telling me this?!!?" And both of them are one-dimentional. One just tells me I have to confess to my sin and say "yes" ("yes" to

[11:58] <Zoffix> what?!) and the other keeps yapping about being strong. I also hate how Ubisoft cheated: they made the world prettier but to do so, they had to sacrifice how long bodies/objects remain in the world. So it often happens if you kill a guy or animal just far enough ahead of you, chances are the corpse will vanish when you get there. I once had it that there were two Mooses standing. I shot one, briefly

[11:58] <Zoffix> glanced to the side, look back and the one I shot is still there, but the other alive one just vanished. There wasn't any place for it to run away that fast--it's really just the game removing objects from the world because I was looking elsewhere.

[16:05] <timotimo> ah, many different examples, each of which is self-sufficient?

[16:05] <jnthn> yeah, something like that

[16:05] <timotimo> i held it in english for the benefit of nwc10 who's in the audience :D

[16:05] <jnthn> Well, they do build upon each other a bit I guess :)

[16:08] <timotimo> so, my examples were: a program that prints "first" "second" "third" over and over in a loop, i suspended it and "step"ped until the next line showed up

[16:08] <timotimo> then i showed rc-forest-fire and dug through lexicals and attributes for a bit - though it would have been good to go into for example the @!spots array or what it was called

[16:08] <timotimo> the third one was multithreaded-count-chars where i showed backtraces of multiple threads

[16:10] <jnthn> ah, nice :)

[17:09] <Zoffix> pmurias, what was that migration-less branch you were talking about? I'd love to get rid of migrations as they're fairly annoying and need a bunch of annotations.

[17:10] <Zoffix> I wonder if we can't just leave all the blocks unmigrated and at the end of codegen just do two passes over the entire QAST tree: (1) collect all the QAST::Block and all the things that need migration; (2) go through things that use them and pop the stuff we collected next to them, so they're migrated into the right scope

[17:12] <Zoffix> Currently, I need to grab the parent of a QAST::Block to do the migration, but the QAST::Block is generated far upstream from where my routine is at :/

[22:37] <Zoffix> Any other way to get NaN/Inf?

[22:37] <samcv> maybe they define it as a #define?

[22:40] <samcv> oh apparently NAN is defined in <math.h>

[22:40] <samcv> and you can compare it with isnan() if you want to check if something is NaN

[22:57] <Zoffix> I pulled everything, built everything, and everything was fine. Then I committed my commit and ran the `z bump` and it died

[22:57] <samcv> it just ends up deleting everything in 3rdparty/libatompic_ops

[22:57] <samcv> if you pull --rebase it may fail though

[22:58] <Zoffix> oh, maybe that's what my script does.

[22:58] <Zoffix> Yeah https://github.com/zoffixznet/z/blob/master/lib/RDev.pm6#L141

[22:58] <samcv> yeah that would make sense. i tested several times to try and make sure there weren't any issues. and my testing seemed to indicate that deleting files + adding submodule is fine. but having a submodule and then git going to a commit where that submodule doesn't exist (and there's other files in its place) it gets angry
