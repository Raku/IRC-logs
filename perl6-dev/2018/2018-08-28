[12:18] <MasterDuke> lizmat, et al.: any further thoughts on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2228 ?

[12:20] <lizmat> MasterDuke: believe it or not, but I'm again about to be on the road until later tonight

[12:20] <lizmat> been too busy with other things

[12:20] <timotimo> lizmat: i don't fully agree with your suggestion to use the existing constant folding

[12:21] <lizmat> timotimo: why ?

[12:21] <timotimo> because it'll turn the result into a WVal containing a Range object

[12:21] <lizmat> yes

[12:21] <MasterDuke> lizmat: no worries

[12:21] <timotimo> though i suppose you could then call its methods to find out what the range endpoints are

[12:21] <timotimo> i expect there was some reason for not wanting to fiddle with the WVal Range when that was implemented, but i don't remember :|

[12:22] <lizmat> ah, ok, I see that "my $a = 1..10" codegens to infix:<..>(1,10)

[12:23] <lizmat> but that also means  that "my $a = 1..10 + 1" could be codegenned into infix:<..>(2,11) , right

[12:24] <lizmat> instead of codegenning it to a constant Range

[12:25] <timotimo> that'd require an extra opt pass somewhere

[12:25] <timotimo> it'd look a little like the junction folding opt

[12:34] <lizmat> so why don't we codegen "Range.new(1,10)" into a single WVal, instead of calling Range.new with 2 WVals ?

[12:34] <lizmat> is it because it wouldn't make any ses

[12:34] <lizmat> sense in the precomp case?

[22:56] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to pmurias.

[23:01] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: hm, are you sure that's on rakudo HEAD?

[23:02] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: go ahead and rename .pm files, I see no problem with that

[23:03] <AlexDaniel> yes it will make git history a tiny bit more complex, but that's ok

[23:07] <tbrowder_> well, i just checked out master branch, fetched and pulled from upstream, and configured for a local build. i did notice during the build that there were some msgs about checkng out certain branches of nqp, etc.

[23:07] <tbrowder_> the usual

[23:09] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: that's very interesting…

[23:09] <AlexDaniel> because just a few commits ago it was clean for me (for the release)

[23:10] <tbrowder_> ok, i’ll use the release and see what happens...

[23:11] <MasterDuke> hm, npq passed `make j-test` locally when i made that commit

[23:11] <yoleaux> 19:31Z <uzl> MasterDuke: `if ($number ~~ s/^E//) {`, I don't remember the error correctly but I was getting something related to globbing, which was fixed after adding the parenthesis. It was probably not related though.

[23:11] <yoleaux> 19:32Z <uzl> MasterDuke: I usually put the spaces around the variables in the hash accesses to make them easier to read. Are there occasions when these spaces make a difference?

[23:11] <yoleaux> 19:33Z <uzl> MasterDuke: `grep: { $_ }`. The thing is that the array shouln't be a number but an Assignment object. `%!assignments<Homework>[1..*]` is meant to skip the zeroth element (a whole number) which keeps tracked of the number of assignments. I didn't know about `.skip` so I'll look into it.

[23:11] <yoleaux> 19:34Z <uzl> MasterDuke: I don't know why but I always get ARGS and ARGV (which I think isn't a thing in P6) confused. Anyway...Thanks for taking the time to proofread it. Really appreciate it. I've updated the post to reflect your corrections.

[23:12] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: any comments?

[23:13] <AlexDaniel> I *think* everything looked good for the release, but maybe not?

[23:13] <AlexDaniel> I just tried buliding r-j on the release branch and there were some errors…

[23:13] <MasterDuke> there is no Ops.istype_nodecont, it's Ops.istype_nd

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: so how did it work in the past

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> ?

[23:15] <tbrowder_>  git checkout release-2018.08

[23:16] <MasterDuke> dunno. rebuilding everything now to see what's up

[23:16] <tbrowder_> duh, wrong window :D

[23:16] <MasterDuke> but i think the *_nd stuff is pretty new

[23:16] <jnthn> The various _nd (no-decont) forms appeared as part of rescalar
