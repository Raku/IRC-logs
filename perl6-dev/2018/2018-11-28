[20:18] <lucasb> Why is LTA? Should it mention "Could not find symbol '&bar' in module Foo" ?

[20:22] <lizmat> lucasb: yes, it should at least mention *where* it looked

[20:23] <lizmat> oddly enough, that doesn't complain about Foo not existing

[22:41] <lucasb> why subscripts propagate the failure while method calls throw?

[22:44] <lucasb> From S02: Single dispatch of a Failure invocant to any method not in Failure returns the same Failure, so that cascaded method calls can be checked with a single check: $object.fee.fie.[$foe].{$foo}.sic // die "Oops: $!";
