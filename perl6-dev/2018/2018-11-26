[10:45] <timotimo> hello guest-53 

[10:45] <timotimo> what is this "it"?

[10:46] <guest-53> cmd.exe /x/d/c "C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe -e "use AnyEvent::HTTP;" 2>&1"

[10:46] <guest-53> can you explain what does it do 

[10:46] <guest-53> as i dont have any idea regarding perl 

[10:47] <guest-53> Process C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe

[10:48] <guest-53> perl514.exe

[10:48] <guest-53> these are some of the commands i am finding on a machine 

[10:49] <guest-53> can anyone help out regarding these  things 

[10:49] <timotimo> ah, you've actually joined a channel about perl6, which is different enough from perl5 that your question might not find a good answer here

[10:49] <timotimo> however, there's a channel called #perl which should be able to help you better

[10:50] <guest-53> thanks

[15:20] <SmokeMachine> is this right?! https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S17-supply/watch-path.t#L38

[15:20] <SmokeMachine> shouldn't it be `isa-ok $s, Supply, 'Did we get a Supply?';`

[15:20] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Yes, think it should be

[15:20] <yoleaux> 25 Nov 2018 13:32Z <ufobat> jnthn: could you please create a OpenAPI::Model release 1.0.3 on cpan, because the github tag doesnt work since the module is not part of perl6/ecosystem

[15:21] <SmokeMachine> ok, Im fixing it...

[15:21] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: I'm trying to fix something:

[15:21] <SmokeMachine> m: %*a{Int}

[15:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3b460ae95: OUTPUT: ¬´Dynamic variable %*a not found‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[15:21] <SmokeMachine> m: my %*a{Int}

[15:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3b460ae95: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§The {} shape syntax with the & sigil is reserved‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3my %*a{Int7‚èè5}‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        statement end‚ê§        statement modifier‚ê§        statement modifier lo‚Ä¶¬ª

[15:22] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: its getting the sigil by getting the first char of $*VARIABLE...

[15:22] <SmokeMachine> but $*VARIABLE in this case is a call to &DYNAMIC

[15:23] <SmokeMachine> I've changed to get from $<variable><sigil>.Str... ran the spec tests and this file was the only problem...

[15:24] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: do you see any problem with this change?

[15:41] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Seems reasonble provided that tree structure can be relied on to be available

[15:42] <jnthn> nine: With Inline::Perl5, I have a Perl 5 module that returns an object but...it doesn't provide methods to get at its properties, it just expects you to poke at them via the hash interface. But I'm not seeing a way to do that; associative indexing doesn't do it, for example. Is there a good way?

[21:30] <timotimo> ThreadPoolScheduler's supervisor is doing lots of sinking, it appears; i'm seeing it sink Slip a bunch, and it might come from the "if $exhausted" block; probably from inside, though?

[21:32] <timotimo> i'm trying to track down why moarperf's memory usage grows slowly even when no requests are coming in

[21:32] <timotimo> at the very least the TPS is generating spesh logs all the time

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I'm seeing growing memory usage in long running processes

[21:36] <AlexDaniel> not sure if an idling script is enough, or if it's related to proc::asyncs (my scripts do that a lot)

[21:38] <timotimo> if there's proc::async you'll have the TPS and its supervisor

[21:39] <timotimo> i don't see a reason for it to grow endlessly, though

[21:54] <timotimo> the only times MVM_malloc is hit during idle times is when creating new spesh logs

[22:11] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: i might have The Cause

[22:11] <timotimo> do you have a process somewhere that grows a bunch?

[22:24] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yeah locally, but I can't share the script unfortunately

[22:28] <lizmat> timotimo: what did 490fd7623ed6710d83152b8 fix?  (apart from the technical "off-by-one" ?

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I did run Blin yet another time, it's clean

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> samcv: canary looks fine too, releasable is happy

[22:29] <AlexDaniel> samcv: so please go ahead and cut moar release, as nothing is going to change in moar I think

[23:28] <timotimo> lizmat: the profiler frontend relies on this data

[23:29] <timotimo> i was getting values from other places in the tree in some situations accidentally

[23:29] <timotimo> well, "some situations" that definitely occur in every graph that's got more than a few nodes

[23:31] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: all you'd need to do is attach a gdb and see if a breakpoint on MVM_spesh_log_create gets hit over and over even when the script isn't doing anything

[23:32] <timotimo> whoa, jj has "rakudobrew build panda" in the lpw18 slides
