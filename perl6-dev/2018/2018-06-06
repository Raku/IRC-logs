[04:12] <Tison> why is the code snippet sometimes use @a sometimes use \a?

[04:13] <Tison> I think we can change it all to `\a`, right?

[20:39] <Kaiepi> dumb question but what do REPR mean?

[20:39] <Kaiepi> as well as SPESH

[20:42] <hoelzro> representation (iirc)

[20:42] <hoelzro> SPESH == specialization

[20:43] <Kaiepi> ahh

[20:43] <Kaiepi> ok thate explains a lot

[20:43] <Kaiepi> thanks

[20:43] <hoelzro> np!

[20:44] <Kaiepi> btw i have a quick question for people who own debian

[20:44] <Kaiepi> could you test a bug in Net::LibIDN2?

[20:44] <Kaiepi> i can't reproduce it on any of my systems

[20:45] <Kaiepi> or any of my vms

[20:46] <Kaiepi> ubuntu's also works

[21:09] *** perlpilot left
[21:16] <robertle> Kaiepi: I can try, what's the question?

[21:18] <Kaiepi> ok so i have a travis build that fails over something that looks like a MoarVM bug

[21:18] <Kaiepi> lemme get the code

[21:18] <Kaiepi> actually

[21:19] <Kaiepi> git clonse [email@hidden.address] and run zef test

[21:19] <Kaiepi> it *should * pass all tests, but i haven't been able to replicate

[21:19] <Kaiepi> maybe a buf in MoarVM?

[21:20] <Kaiepi> the error i was getting was VMExcception has no REPL data or something along those line

[21:20] <robertle> Missing serialize REPR function for REPR VMException (BOOTException)

[21:20] <Kaiepi> that's what you get?

[21:20] <robertle> yeah

[21:20] <Kaiepi> wtf

[21:21] <Kaiepi> it works on openbsd, freebsd, alpine linus

[21:21] <robertle> I'll look into it, but I need to got to bed now. on the

[21:21] <Kaiepi> i'll post an issue aboutit

[21:21] <robertle> systems that you have and where it works, what version of libidn do you have>

[21:22] <robertle> I have 0.16

[21:23] <Kaiepi> 2.0.0

[21:24] <Kaiepi> also since distro maintainers are annoying they mess with the versioning

[21:25] <Kaiepi> i had to make a hacky test to check if the version lower was below when sertain features were implemented

[21:25] <robertle> what does that test look like?

[21:26] <robertle> upstream does not appear to have 2.0.0 *or* 0.16... https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/

[21:27] <robertle> ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/ looks more like it

[21:28] <Kaiepi> i've looked thorugh the nm dumsp of the library

[21:28] <Kaiepi> on ubuntu it's v0.90 or something time

[21:28] <Kaiepi> s/time/dump

[21:29] <Kaiepi> v0.9.0 iirc?

[21:29] <robertle> I really need to go to bed now, but I'll do more investigation tomorrow

[21:29] <Kaiepi> aight

[21:29] <Kaiepi> thanks for the help btw

[22:41] <MasterDuke> i have an idea for a grant proposal. i don't have time to do it, but i'll put it out there if anyone wants to give it a go

[22:41] <MasterDuke> i'm thinking CI related. get the toaster better automated and tied in to travis/appveyor

[22:43] <MasterDuke> and add in a bunch of performance benchmarks (e.g., Tux's, perl6-bench, Matt Oates')

[22:47] <timotimo> i think CI for performance benchmarks is likely a bad idea

[22:47] <timotimo> i'd assume measurements to be noisy beyond recognition

[22:49] <MasterDuke> well, it doesn't have to run on travis/appveyor

[22:50] <timotimo> that's fair

[22:50] <Kaiepi> benchmarks yes please

[22:50] <MasterDuke> i really just mean automated and tied in the repos somehow

[22:51] <Kaiepi> ah

[22:51] <MasterDuke> i've been playing around with japhb's perl6-bench

[22:51] <Kaiepi> maybe i should write a script to do basic benchmarks and stresstests

[22:51] <Kaiepi> oh damn someeone thought it first

[22:52] <MasterDuke> and it builds the commits it tests. was thinking maybe try to modify it to pull them from the whateverable server. should be much faster

[22:52] <Kaiepi> is there a unit test suite available yet?

[22:52] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: it's pretty old. you could do a lot of cleanup/enhancing

[22:52] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench if you're interested

[22:54] <Kaiepi> i'll take a look
