[00:47] <ronsavage> lizmat: Hi. I just read thru the https://github.com/perl6/perl6-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/modules.md. Please note that CGI::Session is abandonware. I rewrote it as Data::Session.

[00:47] <psch> hi #perl6-dev

[00:47] <psch> trying to build r-j i run into a bindpos_n miscall -- or something like it at least

[00:48] <psch> jdb points me at gen/jvm/CORE.setting:29581, which is part of the autogenerate numarray

[00:49] <psch> this is where numarray is used as a parameter type constraint

[00:49] <psch> neither r-j (as far as it builds) nor r-j recognize the *type* numarray

[00:49] <psch> r: sub f(numarray $a) { }

[00:49] <camelia> rakudo-jvm a92950fb4: ( no output )

[00:49] <camelia> ..rakudo-moar a1fd0b732: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Invalid typename 'numarray' in parameter declaration.␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3sub f(numarray7⏏5 $a) { }␤»

[00:50] <psch> ...i'm assuming the r-j build here is from before whenever that was introduced

[00:52] <psch> examining this after writing it down here makes me think numarray might be setting-scoped somehow, for what it's worth

[00:53] <psch> but if scope is somehow broken during CORE compilation between r-j and r-m i'd think myself solidly out of my depths

[00:57] <Zoffix> psch: FWIW bartolin++ has successfully built JVM and ran spectest a day or so ago. So there shouldn't any compilation errors on HEAD

[00:58] <Zoffix> ronsavage: thanks. Updated it in https://github.com/perl6/perl6-most-wanted/commit/4fa96a646a066a24fc294bdf3d647270ee5aac66

[00:59] <psch> Zoffix: might've been a case of "i heard nom got dropped but the repo was still on it," rebuilding now

[00:59] <Zoffix> Ah :)

[01:01] <ronsavage> Zoffix: Thanx. Data::Session does not include an equivalent of CGI::Session::Auth. I suggest add that back for now.

[01:02] <Zoffix> Done: https://github.com/perl6/perl6-most-wanted/commit/ed52b5256fad25419c24caf97f66d6f7c7b9d6c6

[01:22] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: next

[01:22] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in 2 days and ≈17 hours. Blockers: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22%E2%9A%A0+blocker+%E2%9A%A0%22. Unknown changelog format

[01:23] <psch> apparently yes, 'git checkout master' in $RAKUDO_SRC solved the build hangup :)

[01:24] <AlexDaniel> heh!

[01:35] <psch> hm, can i force 'make test' to not parallelize?

[01:35] <timotimo> TEST_JOBS=1 maybe?

[01:35] <psch> 'cause the output looks like it does parallelize and i get non-deterministic failures

[03:04] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: any chance of getting my rakudo PR #1339 merged for the next release?

[03:05] <AlexDaniel> hmmmm

[03:05] <tbrowder> it would close some issues!

[03:05] <tbrowder> it might mKe DrForr happy!

[03:06] <tbrowder> *make

[03:06] <AlexDaniel> from one hand we don't know what it could break, from the other hand a bunch of star users will be stuck with unusable pod features if we don't merge…

[03:06] * AlexDaniel hovers over the merge button

[03:07] <tbrowder> it would free me to concentrate on anothe PR to close more issues!

[03:07] <AlexDaniel> :)

[03:07] <tbrowder> and, if it does break things, they can be fixed...

[03:09] <tbrowder> otherwise, move it to 6.d

[03:09] <tbrowder> pretty please :-D

[03:10] <tbrowder> at any rate

[03:13] <tbrowder> ...in any event, the PR has the solution to converting p5 module Text::ParseWords to p6 which would make lizmat happy!

[03:13] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: will you close all the tickets that are now resolved?

[03:13] <AlexDaniel> do you have the rights to do that on RT?

[03:13] <tbrowder> yes! thanks!

[03:14] <AlexDaniel> k

[03:14] <tbrowder> um, i think i have done that...

[03:15] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: next

[03:15] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in 2 days and ≈15 hours. Blockers: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22%E2%9A%A0+blocker+%E2%9A%A0%22. Unknown changelog format

[03:15] <AlexDaniel> hopefully we'll see if anything is very wrong during this time :) Also will do another toaster run right before the release

[03:15] <AlexDaniel> (if nobody beats me to it)

[03:16] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: as for futher POD PRs, I'm not really sure. I don't fully like where this is going

[03:16] <AlexDaniel> it feels like we're sweeping bugs under the rug

[03:17] <AlexDaniel> which is maybe OK as long as stuff is getting more usable, but still…

[03:18] <AlexDaniel> and the code is getting too complex for the simpliest stuff like making sure that quotes are not part of the string :S

[03:19] <tbrowder> is anyone working on pod probs in the meantime? are we going to abandon p6 pod for something else? if not, won’t the fixes still be generally applicable?

[03:20] <tbrowder> my next goal is a grammar or action change to fix some of the pod issues.

[03:20] <AlexDaniel> well I'm thinking with this comment in mind: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1300#issuecomment-351248903

[03:24] <tbrowder> yes, that was a good step for format codes, but the issues i want to work are more “basic” and involve parse errors, not weird conversion problems which are more at the class definition level.

[03:25] <AlexDaniel> well, chances are you know better what to do

[03:26] <tbrowder> so, should i go away until a new pod language is being developed?

[03:26] <AlexDaniel> I think that you're ready to do it :)

[03:27] <AlexDaniel> I mean, implement it as a language

[03:27] <AlexDaniel> nobody else is working on it, I haven't heard anyone planning to do it

[03:27] <tbrowder> that is way above my pay grade!

[03:30] <AlexDaniel> I believe in you!

[03:33] <tbrowder> but there is someone who was working on it last in i think about 2015. her name is S* and i’ll see if i can find the reference...

[03:33] <AlexDaniel> ShimmerFairy?

[03:36] <AlexDaniel> unfortunately this blog post is not in web archive: https://shimmeryfairy.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/improving-pod-handling-in-rakudo/

[03:39] <tbrowder> yes, and i can’t find her on github now which i think she used to be on...maybe bitbucket or something else...

[03:40] <AlexDaniel> it's right there but I don't know how this would help: https://github.com/ShimmerFairy/

[03:41] <tbrowder> ok, just found her on github: ShimmerFairy

[03:42] <tbrowder> it’s the SUPERNOVA repo

[03:44] <AlexDaniel> right, supernova

[03:47] <tbrowder> is that kind of what you have in mind for a separate pod language?

[03:48] <AlexDaniel> well I was thinking that it would be in core

[03:49] <AlexDaniel> and I totally forgot that supernova existed

[03:49] <AlexDaniel> but perhaps the effort should be continued?

[03:49] <AlexDaniel> I really don't know. I think I “joined” the community right when the effort on it stopped, so I don't remember anything from the time

[03:49] <AlexDaniel> maybe others can comment

[03:51] <tbrowder> comments would be welcome!

[03:52] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: while others are waking up, maybe you can try using supernova with the latest rakudo?

[03:52] <AlexDaniel> I'm wondering if it still compiles/runs

[03:53] <tbrowder> when i last looked at that i didn’t know quite as much as the little i know now, but i think i can try...but i won’t have much time until after 27 jan...

[03:54] <AlexDaniel> Its TODO file is really interesting to read: https://github.com/ShimmerFairy/SUPERNOVA/blob/master/TODO.pod6

[04:11] <tbrowder> yes, makes much more sense now...

[04:12] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: g’night from UTC-5, and many thanks for the merge!

[18:30] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: i forked ShimmerFairy’s SUPERNOVA and grammar-parsefail, and the tests on the latter work fine.  not so with SU* but i will (1) add in all the current roast pod tests and (2) separate the good from the bad to see if anything needs updating. then i’ll move along trying to make progress toward SF’s original plan.

[18:32] <tbrowder> i note that i filed an issue back in november asking her to look at my table improvents for her work but she seems to have left perl 6 and github about two years ago.
