[00:32] <MasterDuke> Zoffix++ got my add_I working

[00:34] <MasterDuke> what's weird now, is that i'm trying to actually handle non-native correctly for not just that one op, so i put in an if/else

[00:34] *** samcv joined
[00:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v samcv

[00:37] <MasterDuke> `if nqp::objprimspec(@bounds[0]) == 1 && nqp::objprimspec(@bounds[1]) == 1 {             $op.push(QAST::Stmts.new( <all the normal stuff> } else { <*_I ops> }`

[00:39] <MasterDuke> and in stage optimize of the build i get `Cannot invoke this object (REPR: P6opaque; NQPMu)` at the `} else { $op.push(QAST::Stmts.new(` line

[00:47] <timotimo> does the gdb trick help at all?

[01:04] <MasterDuke> ugh, haven't tried gdb yet

[01:05] <timotimo> debugserver might also be a possibility, though you'll have to have the breakpoint earlier than the explosion

[01:08] <MasterDuke> running in gdb now

[01:08] <MasterDuke> i find it odd that it's dying there at all

[01:09] <MasterDuke> before that line ran unconditionally

[01:09] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[01:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[01:10] <timotimo> it's probably something else than what it looks like

[01:12] *** cognominal-p6 left
[01:12] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[01:13] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[01:15] <MasterDuke> ok, at the nqp::asec_n i added right after the else, before that line

[20:02] <moritz> I don't know if that has been brought up already, but Azure offers free CI/CD for Open Source projects: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-pipelines-with-unlimited-ci-cd-minutes-for-open-source/

[20:26] <dogbert17> hmm, 'MoarVM oops: Malformed DU chain: reading sp_getspeshslot of 6(1) not in graph'

[20:28] <dogbert17> timotimo: can you see anything strange in this gist? https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/ce367c235a9627511d1c11e2765cd644

[20:35] <timotimo> looks like something that turns getspeshslot into const_s doesn't update users/definers properly

[20:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaiepi

[20:36] <timotimo> so maybe the user of r6(1) is still in the DU-chain, but the op that's in there isn't in the graph any more

[20:36] <timotimo> and that's where it asplodes

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: so that's a segv in zef, right?

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> zef introduced some .race-iness lately, so that's the most likely cause

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> … maybe?

[22:23] <AlexDaniel> not that rakudo shouldn't be fixed, just saying that possibly that's not a new thing
