[16:25] <AlexDaniel> gah, v6.c/v6.d stuff is annoying

[16:25] <AlexDaniel> context: https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/2155#issuecomment-403226706

[16:26] <AlexDaniel> so in an ideal world docs can't say that starts-with returns a Bool, because there are no tests

[16:26] <AlexDaniel> and even if we add tests, these tests wouldn't be part of v6.c

[16:26] <AlexDaniel> unless cherry-picked to v6.c-errata

[16:27] <jnthn> I think that's being overly idealistic 

[16:27] <AlexDaniel> such a tiny, irrelevant issue, yes

[16:27] <jnthn> I mean, sure, we should add --> Bool on there

[16:27] <jnthn> I suspect so far as tests go, we have quite a lot of things that are declared --> Bool or could be declared --> Bool that don't have exact return type tests

[16:28] <jnthn> But I think when there's little else that could reasonably returned, it's fine to ticket it against roast and doc it that way

[16:29] <jnthn> *be returned

[16:29] <AlexDaniel> sure

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> but to me it does show that we sorta have no framework for that kind of stuff

[16:30] <AlexDaniel> so imagine if the return type wasn't that obvious, then?

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> doc it as “returns a truthy value in v6.c; in v6.d returns a Bool”?

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> but then there's no v6.d yet, call it v6.d.PREVIEW? That can change at any moment so we shouldn't showing this kind of stuff to users

[16:31] <AlexDaniel> be*

[16:32] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/302

[16:36] <AlexDaniel> I guess what I want to say is that a tiny nitpicky thing like this can be a good opportunity to practice what we should do in these cases
