[07:43] <nine> Wow! The patch for getting a working (including JIT) explicitly-managed trait for NativeCall is really quite small: https://gist.github.com/niner/7d30269263f074e7cdc92e5e82bbd552

[07:44] <nine> Can then be used like this: sub SetString(Str is explicitly-managed) returns int32 is native('./02-simple-args') { * }

[08:10] *** gfldex left
[08:14] <nine> While explicitly-managed will already cover a lot, there's still the take-a-string-and-keep-it-for-a-while-but-still-expect-you-to-free-it-by-yourself-when-im-done-with-it(char*) case

[08:14] <nine> That's neither covered by explicitly-managed nor by explicitly-manage($str)

[08:16] <nine> Oh, actually that is covered by explicitly-manage($str)!

[08:27] <nine> There's another oddity about explicitly-manage($str). It doesn't return the string it was originally passed, but the CStr attached to it. So the set_version(explicitly-manage('1.0.0')); in the docs does something very different from my $str = '1.0.0'; explicitly-manage($str); set_version($str);

[08:31] <nine> Also...as discovered earlier, even explicitly-manage()'d strings will be freed eventually by the GC (when the CStr attached to the Str is collected). So while code like the set_version(explicitly-manage('1.0.0')); is safe by virtue of the string constant being kept indefinitely, it is a bit misleading.

[08:32] <nine> set_version(explicitly-manage('1.0.0'.substr(1))) would be unsafe

[08:35] <nine> I've yet to find out why passing the CStr to the sub actually works. That's not even a Str.

[08:38] <nine> Ah, probably because the CStr unboxes to a str, too and that's what ends up in the signature of the generated sub.

[08:38] <nine> And the generic CALL-ME that NativeCall originally uses doesn't check argument types.

[09:07] <nine> Btw. a CStr keeps a reference to the original MVMString. This...sounds like an intriguing opportunity. I guess test-csvip5xs is not the only program that gets some strings from native code just to pass them back to other native code. Wouldn't it be nice if we could forgo the decoding/encoding in such cases?

[11:55] <tbrowder_> hi. i just finished my thoughts on the current state of p6 pod and changes i believe are needed. see the wiki on the rakudo repo. comments welcome.

[11:57] *** Guest67967 joined
[11:58] <tbrowder_> with those changes, i would change table handling so cells would become Pod::Block::Paras after being layed out so formatting code would be easily accessible as well as unformatted text.

[12:54] <timotimo> it's basically displayed to the user from the beginning

[18:31] <brrt> tl;dr - boxing is slow. Natives don't work in Perl6, but do in NQP. postrelease-opts can be a factor 5 improvement. Replacing assignment with bidning another 20%, quite consistently

[18:57] <nine> Wait a minute... there's actually nothing explicit about explicitly-manage($str). All that does is ensure that the char* passed to the native function is not free()d immediately after the call. It will however be freed by the garbage collector. At least it may be (as GC is not guaranteed). The only control the user has is to keep a reference to the string around.

[18:58] <timotimo> that's much better than nothing

[19:08] <brrt> but yes

[19:08] <brrt> If we can make native scalars Just Work, throughout the code, then it'll be possible to write performant perl6 code.
