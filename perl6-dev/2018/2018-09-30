[16:58] <pmurias> Zoffix: what do you think about splitting some docs pages into tutorial and reference parts?

[16:58] <dogbert11> Zoffix: I had a failed test, i.e. t/08-performance/99-misc.t test #3. It seems to make assumptions which does not necessarily hold on all systems

[16:59] <dogbert11> e.g. 32 bit ones

[17:17] <Zoffix> dogbert11: I'm away on business this whole week. I don't know if I'll have any chance to look into it. Try tobfix it yourself. It it's a test I moved from roast yesterday, lizmat++ will likely know more about the problem

[17:18] <pmurias> what are the requirement for merging the js backend into master and how should it be done?

[17:20] <Zoffix> pmurias: IMO Language docs should be tutorials and Type docs should contain reference. IIRC there is a docs issue on that topic somewhere

[17:20] <Zoffix> but other than that, that question lacks context :)
