[01:49] <yoleaux> 25 Jun 2018 13:24Z <timotimo> MasterDuke: the add_i op does tak 3 registers, one of them is the target register for the calculation

[01:49] <MasterDuke> timotimo: yeah, but i've never seen that form (for any of the ops) used

[01:50] <MasterDuke> and the opcode documentation doesn't say anything about that

[01:51] <MasterDuke> and the op signatures there don't show versions with the destination register as the first argument

[01:52] <MasterDuke> it's true nqp and its ops aren't really user facing, so the error messages don't matter as much, but it still seems LTA
