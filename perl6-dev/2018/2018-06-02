[11:55] <nine> Turns out, there _is_ a way to return a VMHash from a Perl 6 method without having it boxed:

[11:55] <nine> method method_table($type) is raw { use nqp; my class NQPHash is repr('VMHash') { }; my Mu \result := nqp::create(NQPHash); for %!cache { nqp::bindkey(result, $_.key, nqp::decont($_.value)); } result }

[12:05] <nine> So it took a _lot_ of figuring out but surprisingly little copying of meta model code to get Inline::Perl5::ClassHOW up and running on an unmodified rakudo :)

[15:32] <nine> .ask jnthn So if I'd want to use the multi dispatch machinery to pick between a multi candidate that takes named args and one that doesn't, my best chance is to give the proto a different find_best_dispatchee method. Right?

[15:32] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[16:15] <nine> Apparently yes:

[16:15] <nine> m: my $proto := my proto AUTOGEN(|) {*}; $proto.add_dispatchee(sub () {say "generic"}); $proto does role :: { method find_best_dispatchee(Mu \capture) { use nqp; nqp::capturenamedshash(capture) ?? sub (|c) { say "named" } !! sub (*@a) { say "positional" } } }; $proto(1, 2); $proto(1, 2, :foo)

[16:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 56dbd735a: OUTPUT: «positional␤named␤»

[16:16] <nine> It's almost scary how simple this is.

[16:34] <nine> Alas, this alone is not enough to get the result cached

[16:42] <nine> But the code for that is easy to find and works :)

[16:54] <nine> .tell jnthn unless you tell me that this is a really bad idea, I'm going to merge it somewhat soon into Inline::Perl5's master: https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/commit/053b8d0c3a9d298cf28bd1c2877de549b82405a8
