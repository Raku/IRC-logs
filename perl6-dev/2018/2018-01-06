[19:26] <AlexDaniel> maybe some folks should look at https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/52a7cc45047215299824fb53f0737f929a351fd0 and decide if it's too much or not

[19:27] <AlexDaniel> I mean, the commit sets a very radical precedent for the doc repo

[19:28] <geekosaur> hadn't we pretty much already decided on that in other contexts? like, say, rakudo itself? (speaking of radical)

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> I think it's fair to say that the question is still open, especially given that many times it was me creating all these issues
