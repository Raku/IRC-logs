[20:23] <japhb> I'm a little surprised that jnthn++'s regex improvements didn't seem to have any effect on the [Tux] tests.

[20:27] *** pyrimidine left
[20:28] <jnthn> Hm, does it used regexes much?

[20:29] <jnthn> (I thought not)

[20:29] <japhb> Come to think of it, I haven't looked at the code in a while.  I'm guessing it's all splits and combs then?

[20:31] <japhb> Is there a visualizer for module dependency trees?  zef's behavior when you ask for the dependencies of a module is to resolve them all, and if anything in the dependency tree fails to resolve, tell you nothing at all -- rather than show you the partial depencies it can resolve, and the failing edge.

[20:44] <dogbert17> stupid question time again ...

[20:45] <dogbert17> when typing 'perl6 -v' I might get e.g. 'This is Rakudo version 2018.11-62-g01c56b4 built on MoarVM version 2018.11-33-gee6ea72'

[20:45] <dogbert17> where does the numbers 62 and 33 come from?

[20:46] <lucasb> how many commits away from 2018.11?

[20:46] <lucasb> idk much git :)

[20:46] <dogbert17> it's a good guess, will check

[20:47] <lucasb> AlexDaniel: what is the git jargon for this? :)

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> it comes from `git describe`

[20:50] *** brrt left
[20:51] <dogbert17> it matches lucasb++ theory. I needed to figure out what I should write in my local tools/build/NQP_REVISION in order to get nine's latest stuff

[20:52] <dogbert17> i.e. perhaps someone with the knowledge should do a bump...hint hint :)

[20:58] <AlexDaniel> just run `git describe` in the appropriate repo

[21:01] <dogbert17> I did so

[21:02] <dogbert17> still, there are some fixes out

[23:45] <jnthn> oh ffs

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> what? Did I do something wrong?

[23:48] <jnthn> oh my.

[23:48] <jnthn> Yeah, it's not sticking the context in the regex at all.

[23:49] <jnthn> I forgot that the /.../ form isn't its own lexical scope

[23:50] <jnthn> I guess it's consistent with the rule that a scope always has curlies.

[23:51] <jnthn> And the reason I used lexical, not local, is 'cus $*W.cur_lexpad doesn't reflect that paren'd matches are their own code objects

[23:51] <jnthn> I think probably the best bet is to revert the opt for the release.

[23:53] <jnthn> I guess I'll have to look at how I might be able to get it as a local
