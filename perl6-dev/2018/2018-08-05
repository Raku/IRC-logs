[00:44] <timotimo> ("devoiced" is the proper term i think? i kind of pulled "silenced" out of a hat

[00:44] <timotimo> )

[00:52] <timotimo> can i just say the activity in the squashathon has been incredible to see

[00:52] <timotimo> i didn't pay very much attention, but damn.

[00:52] <MasterDuke> very much agree, ++s all around

[00:53] <AlexDaniel> 29 contributors I think

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> we're still not down to 0 issues btw

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> and not really close

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: status

[00:56] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, üçïüçï SQUASHathon is in progress! The end of the event in ‚âà11 hours. See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[00:56] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, Log and stats: https://gist.github.com/2581a0430e4cc9f4f611608acdf3d0fd

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> but there's time, so help is appreciated :)

[01:00] <AlexDaniel> about 56 modules received a pull request, that's incredible indeed :)

[01:02] <AlexDaniel> + some were fixed by authors, and some modules received a ticket

[01:43] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo: wow, my most recent profile of Compress::Zlib say 43% of the time is spent in garbage collection and dynamic optimization!

[01:44] *** okdas joined
[01:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v okdas

[01:45] <timotimo> let's see ...

[01:46] <timotimo> how did you generate the test data?

[01:46] <timotimo> just give me all your stuff :P

[01:48] <timotimo> MasterDuke: ^

[01:49] *** okdas left
[01:53] <timotimo> ah i see the code

[01:56] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i didn't have inlining disabled, so i could only profile on a 3k line file (50kb compressed, 209kb uncompressed)

[01:57] <MasterDuke> i've just been using the first n lines of ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Homo_sapiens/ARCHIVE/BUILD.37.3/CHR_01/hs_ref_GRCh37.p5_chr1.fa.gz for my testing

[01:57] <timotimo> so unpacked, head, pack again?

[01:58] <MasterDuke> yep

[01:59] <timotimo> that's a really slow server?

[01:59] <MasterDuke> yeah. the full file is ~66mb

[02:00] <timotimo> i'll have the file in 5 minutes

[02:00] <timotimo> would probably be faster to scp it from your server, if it's on there?

[02:01] <timotimo> hm, i'm the only one logged in right now, so maybe not

[02:01] <MasterDuke> it's up there now

[02:02] <timotimo> where do find?

[02:02] <MasterDuke>  /home/bisectable/hs_ref_GRCh37.p5_chr1-2.fa.gz.bak i think

[02:02] <timotimo> jeez, might want to kick some files out of /tmp

[02:03] <timotimo> i'll save about a minute

[02:03] <MasterDuke> heh. only took 6s to upload it...

[02:03] <timotimo> then you should have sent it to me directly :D

[02:03] <timotimo> https://www.sharedrop.io/rooms/385bdfb9-a043-4335-b1d9-70df7eafb0de

[02:03] <MasterDuke> do you have a null-modem cable long enough?

[02:04] <timotimo> :D

[02:04] *** Caraway21 joined
[02:05] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Caraway21

[02:05] <timotimo> oh, ok, i'm finished getting it via scp

[02:06] <MasterDuke> i should've used zstd to recompress the extracted file. gzip is so slow comparatively

[02:07] *** Caraway21 left
[02:07] <timotimo> heh.

[02:08] <MasterDuke> i just tried a profile of 100k lines and MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE=1, nearly killed my box

[02:09] <MasterDuke> oh. duh. i wanted _INLINE_

[02:10] <timotimo> it's difficult, the 3k lines thing finishes in just 0.6s

[02:10] <timotimo> so not too much to profile actually

[02:12] <MasterDuke> 100k with MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE=1 created a workable profile

[02:15] <timotimo> i think one way to make things faster, though likely not by much, is to not go via the Str.pm6:2176 function, that one calls "encoder" from Encoding/Builtin:26 over and over, as well as "find" from the Encoding/Registry

[02:16] <timotimo> that'd only do at most a second out of a runtime of 10 seconds i think

[02:17] <MasterDuke> oh? and use Encoding/* directly?

[02:17] <timotimo> could do

[02:18] <timotimo> the block at line 253 is responsible for about 3 seconds, and half of that is in "encode" from Str

[02:19] <timotimo> subbuf takes more time there, but that'll be (or has already been) improved by using nqp::slice?

[02:20] <MasterDuke> lizmat merged my PR, so you should have it at rakudo's HEAD

[02:20] <timotimo> cool, i'll update

[02:22] <MasterDuke> yeah, that should make a difference

[02:25] <timotimo> maybe as a super bad hotfix i could make only the op that causes the call graph to blow up "noinline" when the profiler is turned on

[02:25] <timotimo> then you'll get a little bit of info on inlines in the profiler, and you don't have to turn inlining off

[02:25] <MasterDuke> it's just one op?

[02:26] <timotimo> i think so

[02:26] <timotimo> i think it's throwpayloadcaller or similar

[02:27] <MasterDuke> throwpayloadlex or throwpayloadlexcaller ?

[02:27] <timotimo> it has to be the caller one i believe

[02:30] <MasterDuke> yep, i could open a profile of 100k just fine after marking that op :noinline

[02:30] <timotimo> that'll be a disgusting hotfix that'll want proper fixing soon

[02:30] <MasterDuke> gc and opt are down to 8.5%

[02:31] <timotimo> opt was how much before?

[02:32] <MasterDuke> well, 40% when using the 3k file

[02:32] <timotimo> well, it's at least running in parallel to the normal code

[02:33] <MasterDuke> i'm still getting that the most expensive block is the loop {} in get()

[02:33] <timotimo> yeah

[02:33] <MasterDuke> at about 12%

[02:33] <timotimo> inside that the block for if $i.defined takes the biggest chunk

[02:34] <timotimo> i'd say about a third

[02:34] *** ChanServ sets mode: -v jdv79_

[02:34] *** jdv79_ is now known as jdv79

[02:34] <timotimo> line 247 takes about a fifth, and inflate from Compress::Zlib at only between a quarter and a third

[02:35] <timotimo> you want a real microoptimization? move out $nl.chars to outside of the loop :P

[02:36] <timotimo> it gets called once per call to that if block, and it takes about 8.5 miliseconds in total

[02:36] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/retupmoca/P6-Compress-Zlib/pull/16

[02:36] <timotimo> cool, you already found that

[02:37] <timotimo> encode still takes a good chunk of total time

[02:37] <MasterDuke> i'm seeing that the 3rd most expensive is the 'gather while' in lines()

[02:38] <MasterDuke> that may be another place to re-implement lines(), like is needed for IO::String

[02:39] <timotimo> "lines" barely registers on my profile, though i have only (?) a 1M lines file

[02:40] <MasterDuke> huh, lines itself doesn't really show up

[02:41] <timotimo> oh, lines surely only sets up the gather/take

[02:41] <timotimo> and all the actual cost is accounted in whatever causes the body to run

[02:41] <timotimo> also, my body has to run

[02:41] <timotimo> seeya and good luck!

[02:41] <MasterDuke> ah, it's from slurp's self.lines.join

[17:39] <tbrowder_> before i merge my rakudo pr, ugexe had one comment:  should the sub lines which splits lines with ‚Äú\n‚Äù also consider ‚Äú\r\n‚Äù. i said i don‚Äôt know, but i think all system-specific  line endings are magically taken care of with the nqp (and p6) ‚Äú\n‚Äù newline. is that not true?

[17:41] <lizmat> nqp -e 'nqp::say(nqp::chars("\r\n"))'   # 1  , so I think so
