[13:45] <[Coke]> patrickb: I believe we'd have to have TPF be the participating org, as rakudo/moarvm are "just" standalone projects. TPF participated many years ago, and after several years of getting rejected by GSOC, I'm pretty our list of volunteers to organize the process went away. I'm sure both p5 & p6 would be happy to see it happen again, if someone wanted to volunteer to go through the legwork. If you're

[15:13] <patrickb> [Coke]: According to https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_a_mentoring_organization the requirements to participate as a mentoring organization are quite open.

[15:21] <patrickb> [Coke]: I'm wondering whether it might be less hassle to try to apply perl6/moarvm/rakudo (only one of the three) as the organisation instead of TPF because of the officialness of the TPF.

[15:22] <[Coke]> You're welcome to try

[15:24] <[Coke]> From the community standpoint, whichever "level" of org applies, need someone who can volunteer the time to coordinate, and ensure that there is community interest in mentoring, coming up with suggested projects, etc.
