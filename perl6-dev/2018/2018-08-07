[00:12] <MasterDuke> huh. i rebased nqp master onto my default_to_int branch just so it wouldn't get too out of date, but now it won't build, dying on the very first file with `Bytecode validation error at offset 108, instruction 18: operand type 64 does not match register type 32    at gen/moar/stage2/nqpmo.nqp:853  (src/vm/moar/stage0/nqpmo.moarvm:compose)`

[00:27] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2188

[00:27] <MasterDuke> oh, it isn't only a rebase which is a problem. i reverted the rebase and it still won't build. i guess it's the new moarvm that's the real culprit

[00:28] <MasterDuke> and i get the same thing trying to make new bootstrap files

[00:29] <MasterDuke> anyone have any suggestions?

[00:43] <MasterDuke> timotimo: ping

[00:48] <timotimo> pong

[00:48] <MasterDuke> i feel you might have an idea re my recent question

[00:50] <timotimo> hum, a "make clean" doesn't fix it?

[00:51] <MasterDuke> nope

[00:51] <timotimo> o_O

[00:53] <timotimo> i don't seem to remember changes that required a rebootstrap

[00:54] <timotimo> i mean, perhaps an op has changed one of its register types?

[00:54] <MasterDuke> my rename of getstrfromnames

[00:54] <timotimo> can you look up what 32 and 64 are, respectively?

[00:54] <timotimo> renames shouldn't make a difference, as long as the op code number is the same

[00:54] <MasterDuke> how do i find the op code number?

[00:55] <timotimo> i'd just go into gdb and print MVM_OP_getstrfromnames

[00:55] <timotimo> but it's more interesting what 32 and 64 are as register kinds

[00:57] *** Kaiepi left
[00:58] <MasterDuke> No symbol "MVM_OP_getstrfromnames" in current context.

[00:58] <MasterDuke> same with "MVM_OP_strfromnames"

[00:59] <MasterDuke> how do i see the register kind?

[01:01] <timotimo> looking for defines for that number i guess

[01:02] <timotimo> MVM_operand_ and friends perhaps?

[01:05] <MasterDuke> looks like 32 is MVM_operand_int64

[01:06] <MasterDuke> and 64 is MVM_operand_obj

[01:09] <timotimo> ok, maybe by breakpointing we can figure out what the opcode is that it's trying and failing to verify

[01:10] <MasterDuke> val=0x7fffffffd600 in validate_operand at src/core/validation.c:364

[01:12] <MasterDuke> is there some other info i need?

[01:16] <timotimo> i think so

[01:17] <timotimo> could it be found in src_cur_op?

[01:17] <timotimo> or cur_op maybe?

[01:17] <timotimo> aha, cur_info should have all info, like ->name

[01:17] <timotimo> so val->cur_info->name perhaps?

[01:19] <MasterDuke> (gdb) p val->cur_info->name $1 = 0x7ffff77164f6 "sp_guard"

[01:21] <timotimo> that is *not* supposed to be in a precompiled file

[01:21] <timotimo> i mean, the validator only runs on code that's loaded from a file

[01:21] <timotimo> and those aren't allowed to have spesh ops in them

[01:22] <timotimo> what's the opcode for sp_guard? perhaps it's confused by offsets and is seeing an operand as an opcode instead

[01:22] <timotimo> like, off-by-one or two bytes

[01:23] <MasterDuke> (gdb) p MVM_OP_sp_guard $2 = 807

[01:26] <timotimo> hum

[01:26] <timotimo> m: say 807.base(16)

[01:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8b79306c: OUTPUT: «327␤»

[01:26] <timotimo> m: say :16("27")

[01:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f8b79306c: OUTPUT: «39␤»

[11:42] <tbrowder_> o/ #perl6-dev

[11:42] <tbrowder_> i’m still looking for someone to discuss pod with. o

[11:46] <tbrowder_> rakudo GH #1893 has an interesting slant. as i’ve been looking at moving pod to a new slang, why does it have to be part of the main compiler at all? treat it like whitespace and, as TisonKun says, use another program to handle the pod.

[11:49] <tbrowder_> seems like that would: (1) make p6 parsing faster,  (2) use less memory, and (3) make pod easier to treat properly.

[11:49] <ilmari> tbrowder_: aren't there metamethods that give you access to the pod?

[11:52] <tbrowder_> yes, if i understand your question, but they still come from the main p6 compiler. TisonKun and i think a separate program should do the parsing and provide the equivalent of the current $=pod object.

[11:52] *** robertle left
[11:52] <tbrowder_> the main compiler would ignore pod.

[11:55] <tbrowder_> so it would still have to have some pod knowledge, but not nearly as much as now.

[11:57] <tbrowder_>  i don’t have a clue if that is feasible, but it sounds to me like it could work.

[12:05] <tbrowder_> or maybe the current method would be better if it would have a separate pod slang but ignore the pod unless an optional p6 switch was turned on.

[12:08] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: you mentioned going to the printers regarding Intro. Perl 6 brochure. Note that it's size is A5, not A4, and US equivalent is "Half US Letter"

[12:09] <tbrowder_> ah, okay, thanks!

[12:10] <Zoffix> And 19 out of 20 pages will have to be edited to make it fit to US format natively.

[12:11] *** Ven` joined
[12:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[12:12] <tbrowder_> i understand. from the one i printed i think a little scaling on half-letter won’t look too bad.

[12:13] <tbrowder_> maybe print it on colored paper—we’ll see what magic the printer can do.

[12:14] <Zoffix> .oO( 80lb gloss )

[12:15] <tbrowder_> ok. is the indd file the adobe source?

[12:15] <Zoffix> Yes

[12:15] <tbrowder_> thnx

[12:18] <tbrowder_> have you tried scribus on an indd file?

[12:18] <Zoffix> No, and I highly doubt it would work.

[12:20] <Zoffix> Doesn't even come up in the list of supported files; at least with Scribus 1.4.1.svn (which is ancient)

[12:21] <tbrowder_> apparently if the indesign prog saves the file as .ps or .eps scribus can use it.

[12:23] <Zoffix> What about IDML?

[12:23] <Zoffix> EPS, it just creates 20 separate EPS files, one for each page

[12:25] <Zoffix> And they aren't even editable. Just imported as an image

[12:25] <Zoffix> Ah, nm, if you ungrop it ungroups it, but all the text is single letters grouped together

[12:29] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: this article claims newer Scribuses can open IDML: https://opensource.com/article/18/7/adobe-indesign-open-source-tools

[12:30] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: here's an IDML of the brochure: http://temp.perl6.party/Introducing-Perl6-Brochure--PRINT-QUALITY--NO-BLEED.idml

[15:03] <timotimo> i think it requires the loop body to be inlined into the containing frame that has the loop's control structure?

[15:04] <timotimo> for that, we may want to slightly alter the size conditions for inlining; if the containing frame is pretty small, but the contained one is very big, we should say "ok, that's fine. it's as if we were inlining the outer frame into the inner one"

[17:00] <lizmat> jnthn: would that also work for QuantHashes having a Rakudo::Internals::IterationSet ?

[17:02] <lizmat> jnthn: in any case, way cool  :-)

[17:02] <jnthn> Probably there's more places it can be applied :)

[17:02] <jnthn> Please forge ahead and do so; I'm just showing the way on the hottest things :-)

[17:02] <lizmat> yeah... can't wait to do that  :-)

[17:03] <lizmat> shouldn't I wait for hte merge ?

[17:03] <jnthn> Yeah, it just passed spectest so I'll merge very soon :)

[17:03] <jnthn> https://gist.github.com/jnthn/196263d7e888278863d5a4b2e42b2008 runs in half the time it used to thanks to that branch :)

[17:04] <lizmat> so: "has Rakudo::Internals::IterationSet $!elems" 

[17:04] <lizmat> is all that it is needed to have it auto-vivify the attrinbute ?

[17:04] <jnthn> Ah, no, see the stuff I did in BOOTSTRAP

[17:04] <lizmat> :-(

[17:05] <jnthn> Well, I mean, that'll viv it to the type object as usual :)

[17:06] <lizmat> well,one of the reasons of using an IterationSet is that I wanted to be able to pass them around without them being HLLized

[17:06] <lizmat> otherwise it is just an VMHash repr

[17:06] <jnthn> Yeah, you can do that :)

[17:06] <lizmat> I can do what ?

[17:06] <jnthn> Actually I put in a change to NQP earlier today so we can set up IterationBuffer early enough with the correct repr

[17:07] <diakopter> I vaguely remember bumping against that circularity issue a few years ago

[17:07] <lizmat> then I would like to set IterationSet also in there  :-)

[17:07] <jnthn> I was originally going to look at doing the $!storage trick I've done with Map on List

[17:07] <jnthn> But it turns out it's a bit harder there, so I figured I'd get it working for the easier case first :)

[21:01] <MasterDuke> how much memory would it take? at work i have access to serves with 768gb of ram, and while i don't use perl 6 for stuff, i frequently just stick all the data i'm working on in memory because why not

[21:03] <MasterDuke> though usually i'm using hashes, i assume they have the same limit to the number of keys?

[23:23] <timotimo> that smells like earlier memory corruption

[23:23] <Zoffix> How did MasterDuke get better output?

[23:23] <timotimo> running the program with valgrind can often give more details

[23:23] <timotimo> that comes from a gdb session

[23:23] <timotimo> oh, you are in gdb

[23:23] <timotimo> you need to "bt" and if you want a lot of spam, "bt all"

[23:24] <timotimo> no

[23:24] <MasterDuke> Zoffix: is your moarvm built with --debug=3?

[23:24] <timotimo> "bt full" is the command

[23:24] <Zoffix> MasterDuke: I think so

[23:24] <timotimo> to have fewer "<optimized out>" you'll also need --optimize=0

[23:24] <MasterDuke> valgrind is throwing errors i've never seen before

[23:24] <timotimo> :D

[23:24] <MasterDuke> it won't even run the code

[23:25] <timotimo> oh?

[23:25] <MasterDuke> oh, it won't even run 'say "hi"'

[23:25] <Zoffix> I got --no-optimize

[23:25] <Zoffix> Is that the same?

[23:25] <Zoffix> `--no-optimize --debug` is what I use

[23:26] <MasterDuke> https://gist.github.com/MasterDuke17/563b6d65baf1474767148bb62adfaac4

[23:26] <MasterDuke> i leave optimization on, but --debug=3

[23:27] <Zoffix> same error

[23:27] <Zoffix> but btfull gives more stuff

[23:28] <MasterDuke> let me try clang...

[23:28] <timotimo> https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/59551

[23:28] <timotimo> if you want valgrind to work again, downgrade your glibc below 2.28-1

[23:29] <MasterDuke> ah, thanks

[23:29] <timotimo> The Control-flow Enforcement Technology behavior can be changed for SHSTK/IBT at run-time through the "GLIBC_TUNABLES" environment variable. 

[23:29] <timotimo> perhaps with that you can temporarily disable it and make valgrind run again
