[10:38] <lizmat> Zoffix: see if there are any "moarvm" processes still running, and then kill those (gently)

[12:18] <pmurias> jnthn: on the js backend for performance reasons (it's slow enough already :( ) I use NFG semantics for ops in only some places

[12:19] <pmurias> jnthn: it has for example nqp::substrnfg and nqp::eq_snfg op variants 

[12:20] <pmurias> jnthn: currently I'm inserting them using #?if !js #?endif and #?if js #?endif

[12:20] <pmurias> jnthn: but I feel if I want to merge those will become an annoyance to maintain

[12:21] <jnthn> Depends how widespread they are; I can't believe we're touching such primitives as eq and substr very often...

[12:22] <pmurias> jnthn: do you think marking them at use would be acceptable?

[12:22] <pmurias> so we had some form that would processed into nqp::substr on moar and nqp::substrnfg on the js

[12:23] <jnthn> But...when *don't* we want NFG semantics?

[12:24] <pmurias> on the moar backend we want them everywhere

[12:24] <jnthn> In Perl 6 we want them everywhere :P 

[12:24] <jnthn> Maybe one way would be to map substr in the Perl 6 ops to the NFG impl, and substr in NQP to the cheating one?

[13:44] <Zoffix> pmurias: but isn't it the new scope that's the bigger issue and not the $_ or other magic vars in a block?

[13:44] <Zoffix> pmurias: FWIW,  `… if 42` does get converted to a basic `nqp::if` already

[13:45] <timotimo> && also gets converted to nqp::if as well, if i'm not mistaken

[13:45] <Zoffix> Yes, and || to nqp::unless

[13:46] <Zoffix> and // to nqp::defor

[13:46] <pmurias> Zoffix: I assumed the optimizer can remove the scope but it seems to leave the magic vars in

[13:47] <pmurias> Zoffix: but the pragma could just avoid the scope from being created

[13:47] <timotimo> it can only remove the scope under certain circumstances

[13:48] <timotimo> like "no lexical variables defined in there that other scopes close over, or that are prevented from turning into locals some other way"

[13:48] <Zoffix> pmurias: the way you describe it sounds like a nicely gun-shaped footgun. i.e. devs adding variables or something else inside the braces and not noticing some pragma above that effectively disables the braces

[13:49] <Zoffix> I'd say it doesn't really solve the readability issue with nqp::if's

[13:49] <Zoffix> The pragma I mean, not auto-optimization.

[14:20] <patrickb> Hey! I'm still looking into making perl6 relocatable. Following some thoughts about that.

[14:21] <patrickb> Relocatable p6 requires determining the installation path at runtime.

[14:21] *** krendoshazin joined
[14:21] <patrickb> $*EXECUTABLE is no good way to retrieve the installation path, because creating a symlink to the perl6 executable already breaks that path.

[14:21] *** krendoshazin is now known as Guest40525

[14:22] <patrickb> The only way I can think of is to use the path of the executable (moar.exe / main.jar (Is it called that way on JVM?)) and work from there.

[14:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Guest40525

[14:23] <patrickb> Google tells me retrieving the location of the current executable in C requires quite a lot of platform specific special casing (https://stackoverflow.com/a/933996/1975049).

[14:23] <patrickb> Given I've implemented the logic to retrieve the installation path in all the backends, then I'd need a way to communicate that to the HLL. Would a new NQP op be the right way to do that?

[14:24] <patrickb> Or is there another way to get to the install path in the frontend that is readily available?

[14:26] <Ulti> yup if you're being generous to Perl 5

[14:44] <patrickb> Binding HLL symbols is what makes the special $* (e.g. $*PROGRAM) variables work?

[14:45] <timotimo> no, that's the sub DYNAMIC in the core setting i'd expect

[14:45] <timotimo> hll symbols are basically a plain-old hash that gets accessed with a specific API and that is bound to the HLL (which sometimes changes, like between nqp code and perl6 code)

[15:02] <Zoffix> pmurias: but where's the pragma you mentioned that would have the block be ignored?

[15:03] <jnthn> pmurias: It largely just needs the static optimizer to be a bit smarter/more aggressive, which is something I'm going to need soon anyway to make the upcoming PEA stuff more effective

[15:04] <jnthn> No hacky weird pragmas, please. We already *have* a workaround, we ain't going to be adding workarounds to workaround the workaround :P

[15:04] <Zoffix> Yes, +2 for no hacky weird pragmas

[15:05] <Zoffix> pmurias: it's this: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/d97470f57cda6aa24ac0480e52ce5660 vs. https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/abfccebc456f61eb028d01c94229fe0b

[15:05] <Zoffix> pmurias: the block version may be easier to read, but the pragma is very easy to miss.

[15:05] <Zoffix> The NQP version is nice and neat :)

[15:05] <jnthn> Once we can lower normal assignable lexical variables to locals (for now it's restricted to parameters and bound variables) then I think we'll be able to flatten a lot more scopes.

[15:06] <jnthn> Plus $_ becoming a simple lexical from 6.d onwards will probably also help

In short: Add an op that returns the installation path determined via the executable path (moar). Then make use of that op in nqp / p6 to locate stuff. (Probably by setting config<prefix> and config<libdir> or something).

[17:20] <patrickb> Is that a viable approach? Better ideas?

[17:23] <pmurias> patrickb: did you conisder determining the installation path based on the path to the moar file that's being executed (not saying it's a better idea)

[17:23] <pmurias> s/conisder/consider

[17:23] <patrickb> pmurias: That's what I want to do.

[17:24] <pmurias> patrickb: I mean the .mbc file (not expressing myself clearly)

[17:24] <patrickb> hm...

[17:24] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v fake_space_whale

[17:26] <patrickb> you mean share/perl6/runtime/perl6.moarvm ?

[17:27] <patrickb> The path to that file is currently passed to moar from a wrapper script.

[17:27] <patrickb> And when running nqp it's a different file.

[17:29] <pmurias> just a random suggestion, on rakudo.js I load stuff relative to rakudo.js because the node can be in some random location

[17:31] <patrickb> Then one could implement that op differently on JS.

[17:32] <patrickb> The idea is that the op returns the installation path, not the path to the executable.

[19:25] <samcv> question. it seems we default to uppercase hex in all cases except with buffers

[19:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar ddb5f8fc4: OUTPUT: «(68 65 6C 6C 6F)␤»
