[02:39] <MasterDuke> why is a Map Cool?

[02:40] <MasterDuke> huh, and same question about List and Seq

[02:44] <geekosaur> 1-element List and Seq act like that element

[02:44] <geekosaur> possibly same for Map

[02:49] <MasterDuke> ah

[03:00] <Zoffix> Cool are objects that can behave as either stringy or numeric data. Map/List satisfy that (number of elements for numerics, stringified for strings).

[03:22] <MasterDuke> true, but there's a lot in Cool that doesn't really seem relevant, e.g., acosech, roots, trim-leading

[07:13] <[Tux]> test-t              2.674 -  2.825

[07:14] <[Tux]> I guess my PC is too busy with other processes, I'll check again later today

[07:39] <samcv> .tell Zoffix is there a way you could run toaster with this MoarVM? https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/841

[07:39] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[07:39] <samcv> .tell Zoffix jnthn has brought up that it causes %hash.keys to be in a different order on each launch, where previously the order was always identical for the same keys

[07:39] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[07:40] <samcv> no modules *should* depend on that. but it's possible one of them does

[08:21] <Zoffix> .tell I won't have a chance to do that any time soon. IMO that shouldn't go into this release (it's a Star release). There is already a post-release-2018.04 branch in rakudo.

[08:21] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to I.

[08:22] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to samcv.

[08:26] <samcv> yeah it won't be this release. but we can do it later

[08:26] <samcv> spectest is all good. should i run a stresstest too? not 100% sure what additional tests that tests for

[08:32] <AlexDaniel> samcv: yeah please do stresstest it too

[08:32] <AlexDaniel> you can potentially run toaster with this, I think the easiest way would be to rig up some branches…

[08:33] <samcv> i'm guessing most things that depend on hash order would have shaken out due to jvm/js tests which do randomize their hashes

[08:33] <AlexDaniel> but maybe just merge it to master after the release and we'll proceed from there

[08:33] <samcv> yeah

[08:33] <AlexDaniel> btw, samcv++ for testing on big endian

[09:16] <samcv> thanks :) also was happy to Fix our build on solaris as well!

[09:16] <samcv> also i can't install Inline::Perl6 with unmodified mvm/nqp/rakudo

[09:16] <samcv> it's failing t/modify_array.t

[10:13] <jnthn> IMO, yes, let's just merge hash-related PR(s) to MoarVM master after the upcoming release, then we've around a month to deal with fallout

[10:14] <samcv> jnthn++ sounds good

[10:14] <Zoffix> +1

[11:33] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: or find the year it belongs to and add the note there

[11:37] <Zoffix> BTW, the secondary goal of the museum is answering the question "why the hell it took so long to release". I foresee good marketing content, so if you know good bits to that end, don't be shy, commit it

[11:39] <Zoffix> (and I ron't mean a list of people/software to blame; but factual info on what was worked on etc)
