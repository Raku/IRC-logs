[09:36] <nine> Can someone explain this block to me? https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp#L865

[09:37] <nine> We allocate $coerce-reg. We never generated code to write into that register, yet we use it as condition in the if_i/unless_i/whatever op. Then we release it again. But apparently it still works?

[10:02] <timotimo> hm? we do call the generator function with $coerce_reg though?

[10:03] <nine> Yes, but that just generates the if_i r123, ins234 bytecode

[10:03] <timotimo> oh?

[10:04] <timotimo> did you check yet if the block runs at all?

[10:04] <nine> it does

[10:05] <timotimo> oh, you mean the register is never written to?

[10:05] <nine> Used to look like this: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/2a1adeec0522ea2a699d05dc02b200d4f3d0326e/src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp#L842

[10:05] <nine> I don't see anything that writes into $coerce-reg

[10:06] <nine> And nothing that connects it in any way to @comp_ops[0].result_reg

[10:06] <timotimo> it could have been copy-pasted from below

[10:06] <timotimo> almost the entire block shows up a bit further below

[10:07] <timotimo> oh, that also doesn't use the register?

[10:08] <timotimo> - I applied the lookup of extra types in one place in the Regex compiler that

[10:08] <timotimo>   used to use the old lookup. However, I did not add coercion as I'm unsure

[10:08] <timotimo>   what code exercises that codepath and whether the coercion is needed at all.

[10:08] <nine> You mean in loop compilation? Looks just as broken

[10:08] <timotimo> perhaps that's what that's about?

[10:09] <nine> The only explanation that'd make sense to me is that $coerce-reg just happens to be a re-used register that by accident still holds a useful value.

[10:09] <timotimo> if this is about coercing smaller values to bigger values, i.e. i8 to i64, coercion doesn't actually change the truth/falsity of a value?

[10:09] <nine> It is about that, yes.

[10:10] <timotimo> i don't think we have ops that ever overwrite only the lower parts of a value

[10:10] <timotimo> so storing a 0 will always zero out the entire register

[10:10] <timotimo> if we ever change that, this code would probably asplode violently

[10:10] <timotimo> or quietly

[10:10] <nine> Note that we also determine the condition op by @comp_ops[0].result_kind, not by $coerce-kind

[10:11] <timotimo> is this about using if_s on an int for example?

[10:11] <timotimo> and expecting it to stringify the int?

[10:11] <nine> I'm less confused about a non-coerced value working correctly. More about a fresh register luckily holding a sensible value

[10:11] <timotimo> i wonder, though. what happens if you allocate a random number of registers of the same kind first

[10:11] <nine> Nah, the @Full-width-coerce-to is just about int8 -> int64

[10:14] <nine> Yep, NQP's build breaks just by allocating a dummy register!

[10:14] <nine> It breaks late but it breaks

[10:16] <timotimo> sounds like your assessment has been 100% correct right from the start

[10:16] <timotimo> maybe we should make the register allocator chaotic as a "smoke out the bugs" option

[10:16] <timotimo> always have like 5 free register slots available and pick at random

[10:17] <timotimo> could even have a parameter in the environment that lets us bisect which exact register allocation b0rks things

[10:17] <Zoffix> "The

[10:17] <Zoffix> compiler did not know about non-fullwidth natives, and complained about

[10:17] <Zoffix> that with a crash. Fix by teaching it about all the types and coercing

[10:17] <Zoffix> non-fullwidth natives to fullwidth when calling the op.

[10:17] <Zoffix> From https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/df45cb8ce9c3e7b6acd27a28f12820919f7ad19b#diff-25854b745d7c627d1d7f7fd8397e8176

[10:17] <Zoffix> Don't know if that explains the part of code you're asking about.

[10:18] <timotimo> yeah, that's where i pasted the quote from up above

[10:18] <timotimo> about you not adding coercion

[10:18] <Zoffix> Also, that code was over my head, so it's possibly it does wrong things

[10:18] <timotimo> the coercion wasn't actually needed, but for a wrong reason :D

[10:19] <timotimo> don't worry about it

[10:19] <Zoffix> k :)

[10:19] <timotimo> the internet was built upon "rough consensus and working code" after all

[10:19] <timotimo> and we're all still alive on the www

[10:19] <nine> Zoffix: so now I wonder which part of that commit actually fixed or at least worked around the problem. Because you clearly didn't coerce anything :)

[10:20] <Zoffix> haha :)

[10:21] <nine> Btw. another funny find. Of all the expr JIT templates, the one for set seems to be broken. Though where in this mass of code the bug may hide is gonna be hard to find out: (template: set (copy $1))

[10:22] <timotimo> if there's a bug in there, it's probably going to be about how the rest of the compiler handles copies and such

[10:22] <nine> Causes: MoarVM panic: Register types do not match between value and node in t/spec/S02-names-vars/list_array_perl.t when ran with MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1

[10:22] <timotimo> maybe the compiler is just stumbling upon broken code from earlier

[10:23] <timotimo> since spesh is allowed to spit out code without going through the bytecode validator

[10:23] <timotimo> it'd probably be good to output the two register types, and maybe also the register numbers

[10:23] <timotimo> if it's just about set-ing between a 32bit and a 64bit integer, it could be fine depending on the direction

[10:25] <nine> But....we don't have 32bit registers. How could the expr JIT compiler even notice such a discrepancy?

[10:27] <timotimo> oh? hum.

[10:28] <nine> The coercion thing is also surprisingly difficult to fix. Because $qastcomp.coerce will also release the source register unconditionally. But in this case we may want to coerce it a second time to the conditional's result type

[10:30] <Zoffix> gah. So who owns goraku.org?

[10:30] <Zoffix> It was available when I tried to buy it a week ago, but somehow it wasn't purchased and now it tells me it's owned by someone :/

[10:31] <timotimo> hum. namecheap.org seems to have it

[10:31] <timotimo> but there's no contacts in there

[10:33] <Zoffix> rakulang.org it is!

[10:33] <timotimo> raku.code?

[10:33] <Zoffix> Wonder... goraku.party or stay with rakudo.party?

[10:34] <Zoffix> Is .code a TLD?

[15:01] <Zoffix> nine: a month ago, I posted my letter to Larry for alias creation on Facebook and that user went all out dissing it, saying they were never consulted and they apparently missed the year and a half of blog posts on the topic because they don't follow all of the channels. Then they created another Facebook post to mock my post about proposing to remove sigils. At that point, I left our FB group, so I don't

[15:01] <Zoffix> know what else they posted.

[15:02] <nine> Oh darn....I finally realized how to utilize bytecode writing in improving compile_mastop. That will save us allocation of a couple 100K arrays. But that's gonna be a pretty hefty rewrite of that function :/

[15:03] <Zoffix> TBH, I'm not sympathetic to throwing a shit fit just because things didn't go exactly the way you wanted them to go. Nothing's stopping that user from writing about "Perl 6"

[15:16] <cygx> btw, how's the 'Raku' brand supposed to be versioned?

[15:16] <cygx> Perl 6.d == Raku 2018?

[15:17] <Zoffix> Guest85603: At least I don't hide behind a "Guest"

[15:17] <Zoffix> cygx: Perl 6 6.d == Rakud 6.d

[15:17] <Zoffix> *Raku

[15:17] <Zoffix> :)

[15:17] <cygx> so Raku is stuck with 6.* for the forseeable future?

[15:18] <Zoffix> cygx: pretty much. Since it's not merely something we put in print. It has to also work and correctly compare against the existing `v6.d` version pragma.

[15:19] <Zoffix> Guest85603: did you have more to discuss with me? I'm about to head out.

[15:19] <Zoffix> v6.c I meant

[15:19] <Zoffix> m: say v6.c before v6.d

[15:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 316ad5256: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[15:21] <cygx> well, Java did make a distinction between 'product version' 5.0 and 'developer version' 1.5.0 when they pulled that particular rebranding stunt in '04

[15:31] <patrickb> The more bikesheddable a topic is, the more potential there is for the discussion heating up and fighting. Everyone can have an opinion, irrespective of the level of their involvement. A naming discussion is *very* bikesheddable. In that light I very much like the idea behind the "marketing group" recently discussed.

[15:37] <jdv79> i stiil dont get it because anyone that digs enough will find out it is still, or was, Perl6.

[15:39] <stmuk_> its not a replacement name, you don't have to use it. It's very Perl like "there is more than one name to call it" and like his original licence hack

[20:08] <Zoffix> lizmat: what do you mean by the 6.d-prep commit?

[20:08] <Zoffix> lizmat: Raku is the second name for the Perl 6 language. It has everything to do with the Specification

[20:09] <lizmat> raku is an alias of Perl 6  .  roast (aka the Perl 6 specification) in my view has nothing to do with marketing and hence not part of the spec

[20:10] <Zoffix> lizmat: also, this is the release brochure's current look: https://i.imgur.com/VEJkprX.png

[20:12] <Zoffix> I'm surprised at your new pushback at this considering "Rakudo Perl 6" that started all this was birthed by your mind :)

[20:12] <lizmat> huh???

[20:13] <lizmat> also: "Rakudo Perl 6" is something else than "Raku Perl 6"

[20:13] <Zoffix> to which part? The brochure, pushback, or the Rakudo Perl 6?

[20:14] <lizmat> birthed by my mind ?  huh?

[20:14] <Zoffix> Yeah, https://rakudo.party/post/The-Hot-New-Language-Named-Rakudo says "The "Rakudo Perl 6" name for the language was suggested by lizmat++, so I assume there's at least one other core team member who's open to the language name tweak".

[20:14] <Zoffix> It doesn't link to logs tho

[20:15] <Zoffix> But if you find the reddit posts for that article, you'll find your comment clarifying what your suggestion meant

[20:16] <Zoffix> Or maybe clarification was made in-channel

The alias was scheduled to be decided on by 6.d release and I don't see the point of omiting "Raku" on the title on a release whose one of the main deliverables was creation of "Raku" alias.

[20:24] <Zoffix> In fact, there's even a positive point to include it: it servers as a clarificatory statement that "Raku" isn't a full rename.

[20:25] <lizmat> who are we kidding ?

[20:25] <lizmat> a full rename is what *you* want to achieve without rocking the boat too much now

[20:26] <lizmat> a full rename is what a very vocal part of the perl 5 community wants

[20:26] *** fake_space_whale left
[20:28] <Zoffix> If someone wants to argue against the alias because it's unclear if it's a full rename, I invite them to first argue that "Perl 6" is not confusing because it's unclear that it's not the next version of "Perl"

[20:28] <lizmat> and there we disagree :-)

[20:28] <lizmat> so that's basically the problem

[20:29] <lizmat> I guess the sister language meme and I are incompatible

[20:29] *** lizmat left
[20:30] <Zoffix> Raku's success doesn't have to include Perl's demise. You argued yourself in one of your posts that Perl must not die.

[20:30] <cognominal-p6> "outvote Larry". So much for benevolent dictator, welcome to the tyranny of the majority :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority

[20:31] <Zoffix> cognominal-p6: what's that about?

[20:31] <Zoffix> cognominal-p6: Raku's is TimToady's ruling.

[20:31] <cognominal-p6> That was in the reddit thread about renaming Perl 6

[20:31] <Zoffix> Not a majority vote of anything.

[20:32] <Zoffix> Ah

[20:33] <cognominal-p6> In practice, this is more the tyranny of an intolerant and uninformed minority. :)

[20:33] <Zoffix> heh

[23:29] <Kaiepi> i'm determined to get this right since i need it for my telnet library

[23:30] <Kaiepi> next on my list is getsockopt/setsockopt support, or just ops for some of the commonly used options

[23:30] <timotimo> are we okay with not implementing tcp urgent notification stuff?

[23:31] <timotimo> as you could call it "basically broken"

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: maybe you can also take a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/659 ?

[23:53] <Zoffix> t/04-nativecall/12-sizeof.t (rakudo's test suite) segfaulted just now

[23:54] <Zoffix> What sucks is 6.d roast doesn't pass on Windows

[23:55] <Zoffix> Which has been the case for at least more than a year S#320

[23:55] <synopsebot> S#320 [open]: https://github.com/perl6/roast/issues/320 Windows roast failures just before 2017.09 release

[23:58] <Zoffix> There's always 6.d-errata, I guess if it comes out that some tests were badly designed for Windows rather than bugs in Rakudo… and someone badly needs a Windows-functional 6.d roast by that time.
