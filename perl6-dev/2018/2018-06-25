[02:10] <AlexDaniel> so‚Ä¶ 6ake?

[02:10] <MasterDuke> you could rename ours to psake, with a silent 'p'

[02:10] <AlexDaniel> yes, pee-sake

[02:11] <AlexDaniel> :)

[02:11] <AlexDaniel> that's not a bad idea at all

[02:11] <AlexDaniel> and something has to be done, I think

[02:13] <AlexDaniel> 6akefile will stand out in alphabetically sorted file lists, which is nice

[02:13] <AlexDaniel> psake will only make sense with psix I think

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> .tell brrt well, if you look at https://github.com/perl6/p6-sake/issues/19 you'll see that pretty much every language has its own alternative

[13:00] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[13:01] <AlexDaniel> .tell brrt which in many cases is very convenient given that you can write some simple things using *the same language* that you already know

[13:01] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to brrt.

[13:02] <AlexDaniel> exactly :)

[16:45] <brrt> AlexDaniel: I respectfully, but absolutely, disagree

[16:48] <AlexDaniel> brrt: that's ok, but with what? You disagree that it can be convenient to describe some make-like tasks in perl¬†6?

[16:50] <raschipi> They are always a pain for people trying to actually make use of the language. Everything should be either make (which has it's warts, but we're used to dealing with them) or meson

[16:51] <brrt> AlexDaniel: yes, I disagree with that exact premise. But I'm a bit too distracted to go into detail

[16:51] <brrt> also

[16:52] <brrt> I have zero authority on the matter

[16:52] <brrt> You go do what you want to do. Have fun :-)

[16:53] * jnthn hasn't yet encountered any complex build system that didn't make him grumpy :)

[16:54] <raschipi> The main problem is having to learn new ones.

[16:54] <jnthn> gradle making me work in this sort-or-Java-but-not-quite was kinda annoying :)

Goto into a block or between blocks: even with the zero arg constraint that's still a bit tricky; I never came up with a design I liked for it.

[20:25] <[Coke]> could me make it a compile time error if you tried to goto too far?

[20:26] <[Coke]> *we

[20:26] <jnthn> It's all lexical so yes, we can statically detect gotos that we refuse to do

[20:26] <jnthn> And of course doing the limited form may well be useful enough
