[12:39] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I changed nqp::getpid not to use reflection, Java 11 has a proper api to do that but GraalVM still uses Java 8

[12:39] <MasterDuke> ah, nice

[12:41] <MasterDuke> pmurias: fwiw, i've likely reached the limit of what i can easily do for the truffle backend. i don't really know graalvm/truffle or sixmodel

[12:42] <MasterDuke> i'm still going to try to help out, but that may not end up being much
