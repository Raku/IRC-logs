[00:00] <AlexDaniel> I'd call that not a regression

[00:00] <AlexDaniel> not a recent one for sure

[00:00] <timotimo> right

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yeah it's only 2015.12 I think

[00:01] <timotimo> m)

[00:01] <timotimo> :)

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> which attempts to touch things it's not supposed to

[00:01] <AlexDaniel> by the way should bisectable default to 2018.11 now…

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> that's probably a more sensible default

[00:02] <timotimo> that's not a long way away from now?

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> yeah but that's 6.d

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> using too old “old” revisions is usually not what you mean…

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> unless you really want to know when that error message changed :D

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> and that precomp stuff, eh…

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> anyway, maybe a bit later

[00:04] <timotimo> there's still enough stuff that is "the same" in 6.c and 6.d and could have been b0rked before 6.d became the default

[00:07] <AlexDaniel> c: 6.d say 42

[00:07] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¦6.d: «Cannot find this revision (did you mean “v6.c”?)»

[12:04] <lucasb> say 0+'foo'  # Argument "foo" isn't numeric in addition (+)

[12:04] <lucasb> I think it would be helpful to include the string context in the exception message

[14:44] <pmurias> jnthn: what do we want to do with that?

[14:45] <timotimo> pmurias: would you be interested in writing a little piece of instruction how to compile perl6 code to run in screeps? though it'll probably be incredibly slow to load the 10 megabytes of core setting :D
