[01:17] <jnthn> Just a quick heads up in case I don't get to mention it here tomorrow: I'm heading away for a weekend birthday break, and won't be dragging a laptop along with me. I'll be back here on Monday. :-)

[17:36] <nine> Initializing $*PERL during setting compilation is harder than it sounds. But that's just because it throws some exception and I can't find a way to get at the message.
