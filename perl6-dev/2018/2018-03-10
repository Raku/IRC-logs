[17:54] <AlexDaniel> it would be really cool to fix that

[19:31] <Zoffix> Yeah, there's a "filter:subscribed" filter, but don't want to try to figure out how to write a script that hits that API endpoint https://xkcd.com/1319/

[19:31] <Zoffix> I just went through still-open issues and unsubbed manually.

[19:45] <jstuder> hey 6devs, I've got two open PRs and I was wondering if anyone has had the time to review

[19:45] <jstuder> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1601

[19:45] <jstuder> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1542

[19:46] <jstuder> i haven't received a lot of comments, so I don't know if they are no good or not

[19:47] <jstuder> both have MoarVM and NQP components

[19:58] <timotimo> how does that state.rakudo.moar test file fail?

[19:59] <jstuder> not quite sure off hand. It's been a while since I ran it.

[19:59] <jstuder> I will recompile and rerun and get back to you

[20:01] <timotimo> i'll be cooking and enjoying dinner in just a bit, so may not be able to help for a bit

[20:02] <jstuder> ok no problem. I'll just post the output here on IRC when i've got it and if you can check it later if you like. Thanks for taking a look.

[20:05] <jstuder> I'll post it on the github PR thread too

[20:05] <jstuder> probably easier to find there then a sea of IRC logs :)

[21:59] <AlexDaniel> lol what, the cloak works through the matrix netwok O_o

[22:03] <geekosaur> implied by the fact that matrix users otherwise get special matrix cloaks

[22:04] <geekosaur> meaning, freenode knows about matrix and can therefore do things like that

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> yeah but I expected it to be nonoverridable

[22:09] <mst> group cloaks > gateway cloaks > unaffiliated cloaks

[22:09] <mst> so a plain unaffiliated/alexdaniel would be overriden by the matrix gateway cloak

[22:09] <mst> but your cloak is Sufficiently Special to take precedence

[22:31] <samcv> what should i name the option for .decode and encode to specifiy to decode/encode strict instead of loosely?

[22:31] <samcv> which in 6.d will then become the default

[22:31] <samcv> :strict ? what do you people think

[22:40] <pmurias> where is @*comp_line_directives declared?

[22:46] <geekosaur> presumably because that's one of the things that lets nqp be faster than perl 6

[22:48] <MasterDuke> heh, Zoffix++

[22:48] <geekosaur> because now you have vars that are secretly half lexical and half dynamic. which is both more expensive to keep track of and can introduce bugs when behavior is attached to the wrong aspect (which iirc is one perl 6 has run into)

[22:48] <MasterDuke> but if someone can figure out a way to make the generic case better, i'd 100% be fine with removing those special cases

[22:51] <samcv> MasterDuke: do you know how i can pass NULL to a nqp function?

[22:51] <samcv> that will be received as NULL by my C function

[22:52] <samcv> I tried nqp::null and that does not seem to be working

[22:52] <MasterDuke> 0?

[22:52] <samcv> it's a string argument

[22:53] <samcv> ah maybe it is working. i think it may

[22:53] <MasterDuke> huh, don't know if you can. maybe have to check for vmnull and if so change to NULL

[22:53] <samcv> it seems to evaluate the the MVMString * as false so it must be working and the issue elsewhere

[22:57] <samcv> ok before this i need to solve an issue with multi method precedence. i have multi method decode(Blob:D: $encoding, Str:D :$replacement, Bool:D :$strict = False) added but it is calling multi method decode(Blob:D: $encoding)

[22:57] <samcv> it calls the new multi when I use :replacement but if i just use :strict (the boolean) then it does not call it

[22:57] <samcv> should i set it above the other one in the file?

[22:58] <MasterDuke> .tell pmurias i added that @*comp_line_directives stuff when i was adding support for `#line 2 SETTING::src/core/core_prologue.pm6` (so error message gave the real file instead of gen/moar/CORE.setting). but i barely knew what i was doing, so feel free to do something better

[23:00] <MasterDuke> samcv: as i understand it, named args aren't used for MMD, so yeah, might have to do that

[23:01] <samcv> or I could just remove the other one

[23:01] <samcv> since it should still work

[23:01] <geekosaur> and there is an order dependency iirc, because dispatch got too slow otherwise?

[23:01] <samcv> also would be a good idea for me to remove it and make sure all tests pass in roast

[23:04] <samcv> ah it also may be that i specified Str:D :$encoding

[23:04] <samcv> and if i don't specify :encoding then it won't choose that multi
