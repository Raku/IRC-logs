[12:43] <dogbert17> looks good on my system as well as long as I don't run with any flags set

[12:43] <jnthn> My spectest run had a bunch of segv :/

[12:43] <dogbert17> now?

[12:44] <dogbert17> there are really strange things going on but I have to set some flags to make them show up

[12:45] <jnthn> But I can't reproduce anything when running them alone :/

[12:45] <dogbert17> and you don't have MVM_SPESH_NODELAY and MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING set?

[12:47] <jnthn> I didn't when I ran make spectest

[12:48] <dogbert17> interesting, I have to have them set in order to see anything but some well known flapper

[12:49] <dogbert17> if we disregard https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/913 there's at least one other recent bug hiding

[12:50] *** astj joined
[12:50] <dogbert17> for example, what do you see if you run    MVM_SPESH_NODELAY=1 MVM_SPESH_BLOCKING=1 ./perl6 t/04-nativecall/06-struct.t

[12:50] <jnthn> Really can't get any of them to fail :/

[12:51] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v astj

[12:51] <dogbert17> try the one above :-)

[12:52] <lizmat> jnthn: have you tried running a single flapper while having "make spectest" run at the same time ?

[12:54] * dogbert17 only 16 degrees and rain today

[12:54] *** astj left
[12:56] <jnthn> Yup

[12:56] <jnthn> Yes, but I care about what's failing without any of the special flags

[12:58] <jnthn> NODELAY isn't representative of normal operating conditons, so I'm less worried about it

[12:59] <dogbert17> agreed, I'm trying to get stuff to fail without any flags but haven't had much luck today

[12:59] <dogbert17> only the occasional flapper

[13:00] <jnthn> Also, when I build with --debug=3 the make test failures seem to vanish

[13:00] <dogbert17> that's interesting

[13:01] <jnthn> Oh no, I still see a failure, just less often

[13:02] <jnthn> oh, but it was the test I'm running in a loop in gdb and it's because they raced over a test file

[13:03] * jnthn tries creating the memory/CPU pressure with spectest instead

[13:06] <dogbert17> heh, suddenly MoarVM doesn't build on 32 bit - ./libmoar.so: undefined reference to `MVM_jit_code_copy'

[13:07] <dogbert17> perhaps something for nine to ponder

[13:08] <MasterDuke> i just got fails in t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t (think that's a known flopper), t/spec/S17-procasync/nonexistent.t, t/spec/S32-io/chdir-process.t, t/spec/S29-os/system.rakudo.moar, t/spec/S32-list/roll.t, and t/spec/integration/advent2014-day16.t

[13:16] *** Zoffix joined
[13:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[13:16] <dogbert17> AlexDaniel: will do

[13:20] <Zoffix> Random thought: should we actually exclude NQP from the list of repos of the "perl6" team to which all the new members get assigned; oftentimes after just a couple of quality commits?  The specific point of concern is that we bootstrap NQP. If a person had a malicious intent, it'd be pretty easy for them to get standard perl6 org membership and then just offer help to bootstrap NQP, while inserting crap

[13:20] <Zoffix> into it.

[13:25] <jnthn> Zoffix: Yeah, I've sometimes worried a tad about that

[13:27] <AlexDaniel> so the default permission in perl6 org is ‚Äúwrite‚Äù, is it even possible to selectively have ‚Äúread‚Äù for nqp repo without moving it to another org?

[13:27] <pmurias> would we refuse to take a PR that rebootstrap?

[13:27] <pmurias> * rebootstraps

[13:28] <AlexDaniel> we can of course change the default permission, but that is going to affect all repos in perl6 org

[13:28] *** pmurias left
[13:30] <Ulti> give I just accidentally created and deleted a branch on NQP just because I have a load of perms I never wanted I can +1 the sentiment of altering the defaults

[13:30] <Ulti> also its kind of crap that github branch search if it finds nothing defaults to create the branch

[13:31] *** pmurias joined
[13:31] <Ulti> why the F would anyone wishing to browse branches want to create them that way at origin

[13:31] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: what about adding "perl6" team to `nqp`'s collaborators and settting it to read perms?

[13:31] * Zoffix does it

[13:32] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[13:32] <Zoffix> pmurias: sure, why not.

[13:32] <timotimo> Ulti: yes, that hit me once, too

[13:32] <Zoffix> Why would PR refusal be taboo

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I don't think it's going to work, but try it

[13:32] <Ulti> also let me know if I jsut deleted the actual JS branch ;____;

[13:33] <Ulti> looks like its now known as nqp in the browser though

[13:33] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: don't worry too much, if it was something important the author will push it again

[13:33] <Ulti> it was set to be owned by me so fairly sure its fine

[13:35] <Zoffix> Ulti: can you try doing more things? Does it block you now?

[13:35] *** Ven` left
[13:37] <Ulti> Zoffix: one sec will check

[13:37] <Ulti> I can still create a branch

[13:38] <Ulti> might just be I need to log in and out

[13:40] <Zoffix> Actually, I see a message: "The Perl 6 organization has their default repository permission set to write. This means that every member of this organization has write access to this repository, regardless of the team and collaborator access specified below."

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> ok I see what can be done

[13:40] <Ulti> why do people need to be in the perl6 org though?

[13:41] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: what? 

[13:41] <Zoffix> 'cause I'm already in the process of changing it to read

[13:41] <pmurias> are we even sure that we want to change the nqp repo to read?

[13:41] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: set default org permission to read, then go here https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/perl6/repositories then select all and set to ‚Äúwrite‚Äù

[13:42] <Ulti> yeah cant do it now

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> oh?

[13:42] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: what does the permission on the right in that table signify?

[13:43] *** Ven` joined
[13:43] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: that's for ‚Äúperl6‚Äù team

[13:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[13:44] <Zoffix> OK. Done

[13:46] <Zoffix> looks like a couple of repos should really be in perl6-community-modules and not in perl6

[13:46] <Zoffix> org

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> yeah I noticed that too

[13:48] *** Ven` left
[13:49] <pmurias> Zoffix: how are commiters now addable to nqp?

[13:50] <AlexDaniel> there's team `core` and team `nqp`

[13:50] <Zoffix> pmurias: add them to team nqp

[13:51] <pmurias> so all the people from the perl6 have commits carried over?

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> one thing that bothers me is that there are 307 people in the org but only 287 in `perl6` team

[13:52] <Zoffix> pmurias: "the perl6"... what do you mean? The "perl6" team? No, they now have read perms only

[13:53] <pmurias> Zoffix: I mean who is able to commit to nqp now?

[13:54] <AlexDaniel> heh‚Ä¶ I went to https://api.github.com/orgs/perl6/members in a hope that it will give me the full list, but no it does pagination by with only 30 elements per page :(

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: anyone in this team https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/nqp/members or this team https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/core/members

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> although I'm not sure if these pages are visible to all

[13:55] <Zoffix> pmurias: members of "core" team ( https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/core/members ), "nqp" team ( https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/nqp/members ), and "Org-Admins" team ( https://github.com/orgs/perl6/teams/org-admins/members )

[13:57] <pmurias> Zoffix: how was the team created?

[13:57] <Zoffix> pmurias: dunno, it already existed.

[13:59] <pmurias> so why are we channing the set of commiters to list we don't know what it is?

[14:00] <Zoffix> Because I doubt a group named "nqp" spontanously came into existence on its own.

[14:01] *** Zoffix left
[14:02] <pmurias> but are all the nqp committers in it?

[14:13] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: good question. Now yes

[14:15] <AlexDaniel> I invited pretty much every contributor that had 2+ commits to the repo *and* was already part of perl6 org

[14:15] <AlexDaniel> most of them were already in nqp team

[14:18] *** __idiot__ joined
[14:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v __idiot__

[14:20] *** __idiot__ left
[14:20] <AlexDaniel> another good question is how to get all 306 people in `perl6` org into `perl6` team

[14:20] <AlexDaniel> because getting the list of nicknames is‚Ä¶ not that easy :)

[14:21] <AlexDaniel> I mean sure you can overcome pagination just with 10 clicks, but then your requests also need to be authed otherwise some members will be hidden

[14:23] <pmurias> if we want to have more trust than "nobody can be bothered to subvert Perl 6" in our bootstrapped files we need to have reproducable bootstraps at some point

[14:24] <MasterDuke> pmurias: somewhat related question, have you tried rebase the truffle branch onto master? if not, should that be done?

[14:26] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I haven't done that. It should be done :)

[16:58] <jnthn> Yes, the reboot helped. What a waste of time.

[16:59] <timotimo> ;(

[16:59] <timotimo> that's disheartening

[16:59] <jnthn> Good news for your commits though :P

[16:59] <timotimo> yeah

[16:59] <jnthn> timotimo++

[16:59] <timotimo> i'd've prefered the commits to have been faulty and having figured it out in five minutes

[17:00] <timotimo> btw i've looked at a spesh and jit log of jdv's code, and spesh is, like, really really busy in it

[17:00] <timotimo> but not in the way that it's doing bogus logging of frames that should really have been speshed

[17:00] <timotimo> it's just that doing all those evals over and over makes every single piece of the compiler so much warmer

[17:03] <timotimo> Latest statistics for 'set_name' (cuid: 19, file: gen/moar/Metamodel.nqp:102)

[17:03] <timotimo> [...]

[17:03] <timotimo>     Type tuple 132

[17:03] <timotimo> Latest statistics for 'compose' (cuid: 51, file: gen/moar/Metamodel.nqp:273)

[17:03] <timotimo>     Type tuple 65

[17:04] <timotimo> pretty amazing

[17:04] <jnthn> So megamorph :)

[17:05] <jnthn> Though at some point it should give up and make a certain specialization

[17:06] <timotimo> mega morphin' bytecode rangers

[17:08] <timotimo> whee, the maximum stack depth climbs over 5k

[17:09] <timotimo> using set_name as an example, it doesn't ever make a certain specialization, but it also only reaches 146 hits

[17:09] <timotimo> at which point it has, unsurprisingly, 145 type tuples

[17:09] <jnthn> 5k...that sounds...unlikely

[17:10] <timotimo> shall i investigate by doing some random MVM_dump_backtrace calls in gdb?

[17:10] <jnthn> Ah, to see if it's for real? Can try, but I suspect the stack simulation is going pear-shaped somehow

[17:11] <jnthn> btw, did you see I fixed the real "super deep stack" thing some weeks back that made profiles of some parallel stuff look odd?

[17:11] <timotimo> oh?

[17:11] <timotimo> i must have missed that

[17:12] <timotimo> i was convinced it came from throwing past the prof_exit op

[17:12] <timotimo> OK

[17:12] <jnthn> This one was with loads of frames in ThreadPoolScheduler

[17:12] <timotimo> oh!

[17:13] <timotimo> yes, i know what you mean

[17:13] <timotimo> that was very good

[17:13] <timotimo> should also help memory consumption

[17:13] <jnthn> indeed!

[17:13] <jnthn> dinner, bbl

[17:13] <timotimo> have a good one!

[17:13] <timotimo> today was not a sensible day, which means i've had breakfast ~1.5h ago :|

[17:14] <timotimo> here's the biggest guard tree i've seen yet: optimizer's visit_children has 44 nodes in its guard tree

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: Revert "Use $*SPEC.dir-sep for separators in CompUnit::RepositoryRegistry"

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: 

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: This reverts commit c3e1ec0bb86fad16ecca6ca5997d81cd6afc2ba5.

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: 

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: First, I do not understand why changing the directory separator should be needed as internally it doesn't matter anywhere else. Second, things like `"inst#$prefix/vendor` are not paths ( its a cur spec ) so changing them explicitly seems strange -- we don't use `$*SPEC.dir-sep;` for meta6 provides data for instance. Third, the line `@binaries = flat @installations.map: { .script("bin{$sep}$script", :$name) };` will not work because we 

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: 

[17:16] <Geth> ¬¶ rakudo: I'm not sure what problem this intended to solve, but this is likely not the spot to go about solving it.

[17:21] <stmuk> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d8d51d0da2#commitcomment-30047587

[17:34] <stmuk> looks like a rakudo star 2018.06.2 may be needed :/

[17:35] <stmuk> or maybe just remove Windows binary until next release

[17:38] <timotimo> this commit doesn't fix that problem?

[17:40] <timotimo> hm, maybe the nqpbook repository can actually go %)

[17:50] <Zoffix> Just ran a stresstest on a 160-core box... Looking at htop, it lasts about 40s, but then a few cores sit and wait for some test files. In fact, t/spec/S17-channel/stress.t just hung entirely

[17:50] <Zoffix> Oh, nm, it just seemed like forever

[17:50] <Zoffix> But total run time was Files=1304, Tests=152985, 140 wallclock secs (32.93 usr  4.44 sys + 3708.72 cusr 221.77 csys = 3967.86 CPU)   vs 167s on 24-core box

[17:51] <Zoffix> ZOFFLOP: t/spec/S02-types/mixhash.t

[17:51] <timotimo> not such a gigantic win, eh?

[17:51] <timotimo> that's what 40% time saved?

[17:51] <Zoffix> m: say 40/167

[17:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar d8d51d0da: OUTPUT: ¬´0.239521‚ê§¬ª

[17:52] <Zoffix> like 77% if you count the bulk. The rest, I'm guessing it's just single test files taking long to run

[17:52] <stmuk> I'm deleting R* 2018.06.1

[17:52] <Zoffix> ok

[17:52] <Zoffix> stmuk: FWIW, you should now have correct perms on rakudo.org repo

[17:55] <stmuk> ok thanks I can test by reverting the last two changes!

[17:56] <stmuk> works

[17:59] <stmuk> I should have tested more :-\ "but just a little change what damage can it cause" :)
