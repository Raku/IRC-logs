[03:25] <MasterDuke> timotimo: if sometimes an @-sigiled something is an NQPArray (so nqp::elems is fine) and sometimes it's an Array (so .elems is fine), is there a single say that will work for either case?

[03:26] <timotimo> hm, .elems doesn't work with NQPArray?

[03:27] <timotimo> MasterDuke: was it you who figured out the profiler missing one GC run by having its index be -1?

[03:28] <MasterDuke> well, i noticed something

[03:29] <MasterDuke> i think you actually found what was going on

[03:29] <MasterDuke> and lizmat may have been the first to notice. or at least she noticed something, and then i went and maybe found something else?

[03:30] <timotimo> i'm asking because my newest blog post was kind of implying "i fixed that" even though someone else basically did most of the detective work

[03:30] <timotimo> and i didn't just want to take credit like that

[03:31] <timotimo> anyway, all i think you can do is nqp::islist if NQPArray doesn't offer .elems; if it does, i'm hopeful that spesh will inline it gladly

[03:31] <timotimo> BBL

[03:32] <MasterDuke> i think of it sort of like i catalogued the symptoms, you made the diagnosis and the fix

[03:32] <MasterDuke> later...

[04:05] <samcv> i've gotten native int* and uint* types working in repl without the previous error after a fair amount of work in MoraVM and nqp

[04:06] <samcv> it shows a newer error certain times but it's a rakudo issue now instead of being a MoarVM and NQP issue

[04:07] <samcv> oh actually so there's no more issues at all for signed native ints now \o/

[04:07] <samcv> but with uint's it will say "No such method 'perl' for invocant of type 'Perl6::Compiler'

[12:01] <nine> timotimo: the issue with nqp::list($var) ?? nqp::elems($var) !! $var.elems is that $var will be evaluated 3 times causing redeclaration errors. Also it's not sure this is actually faster than the "unoptimized" +@list. So either we add the appropriate workaround in in method install_package, or we just revert the optimization
