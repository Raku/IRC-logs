[15:54] <lizmat> hmmm... Travis complains about t/08-performance/02-qast-rewrites.t failing (no plan found)

[15:54] <lizmat> this appears to be happening on Linux: can someone confirm / deny this problem exists?

[23:02] <MasterDuke> my bad on the failing spectest because of 1844. not sure how that happened, i did run a spectest at the time. guess it had been long enough since i created the PR i should have rebased and retested

[23:02] <MasterDuke> ++ all around for fixing it while i was gone
