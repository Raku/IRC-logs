[22:16] <Kaiepi> i wish i hadn't kept screwing with it when i had it fully working

[22:23] <timotimo> did you check the REPR is correct? i.e. no decont missing for example?

[22:23] <timotimo> Kaiepi: ^

[22:24] <Kaiepi> i tried using a decont and it didn't fix the problem

[22:24] <Kaiepi> i haven't checked the repr though

[22:27] <timotimo> could very well be an undefined object, too

[22:27] <Kaiepi> it it possible to do from gdb? i can't check it from perl since it segfaults as soon as i try to call .tap

[22:27] <timotimo> yes, you can "print IS_CONCRETE(obj)"

[22:27] <timotimo> and "print REPR(obj)"

[22:29] <Kaiepi> it's P6opaque

[22:29] <Kaiepi> which isn't right

[22:30] <Kaiepi> i guess i'll try deconting it again and checking what info shows up for it then

[22:30] <timotimo> in that case a decont would have been right
