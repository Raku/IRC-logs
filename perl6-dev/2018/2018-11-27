[00:45] <tbrowder> timotimo: thanks!

[00:45] <timotimo> just a change of the error message, huh?

[00:46] <timotimo> but this is supposed to work, right?

[12:37] <AlexDaniel> So my plan with R#2499 is to just let it be

[12:37] <synopsebot_> R#2499 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2499 [⚠ blocker ⚠] Failures in Perl6::Parser module

[12:37] <AlexDaniel> we can fix it later, if it's an issue on our side

[12:38] <AlexDaniel> basically we switched to v6.d and that's the only module that is royally broken

[12:39] <AlexDaniel> and most of my PRs for `use v6` on the first line were accepted I think

[12:39] <AlexDaniel> only 5 PRs to be merged left

[12:41] <AlexDaniel> let me know if you disagree, but IMO there's no need to delay the release any longer

[12:44] <dogbert2_> AlexDaniel++ go for it

[12:45] <dogbert2_> there are two MoarVM issues (992, 999) marked as blockers but I suspect we can remove that label now

[12:46] <AlexDaniel> removed it for M#992

[12:46] <synopsebot_> M#992 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/992 MVM_panic in t/02-rakudo/12-proto-arity-count.t

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> because that one I remember confirming

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> samcv: what about M#999 ?

[12:47] <synopsebot_> M#999 [open]: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/999 [⚠ blocker ⚠] MoarVM Fails to Compile on OpenSUSE due to missing libffi.so.6

[12:47] <AlexDaniel> there are two commits for that issue, is it resolved now fully?

[13:07] *** j3nnn1 joined
[13:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v j3nnn1

[13:15] <dogbert2_> Can't help there since I don't have OpenSUSE

[13:39] <timotimo> do we have logs from their build service or something?

[14:18] *** [TuxCM] left
[14:22] <nine> Those won't help because the issue only exists, when you continue to work in the same repository after upgrading your system. The Open Build Service spins up a new VM for each build.
