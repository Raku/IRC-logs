[15:13] <Zoffix> .ask jnthn can you make a couple of pumpking rulings for 6.d: (1) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2105 Is it OK to change DateTime.new to accept a time format without colons (ISO-compilant allegedly) and have DateTime.IO produce such a format instead of current one that isn't a valid filename on Windows?

[15:13] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[15:14] <Zoffix> .ask jnthn and (2) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2089  Is it OK to simplify .toggle by removing the slurpy, multi-Callable candidate (for now, we'll leave room to re-add it back in the future, should we find simple enough behaviour for it)

[15:14] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[21:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[21:04] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: The reasons for having a hard-coded prefix are outweighed by the need for consistency in how namespaces are declared in meta data. This adds ( and prefers ) a full namespace, and falls back to the previous behavior of prefixing the builder value with `Distribution::Builder::` ( the later behavior can be removed eventually ).
