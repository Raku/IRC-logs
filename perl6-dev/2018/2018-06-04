[09:55] <AlexDaniel> one of the cool things is this:

[09:55] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar e4ecf5e5f: OUTPUT: ¬´foo‚ê§bar‚ê§baz‚ê§¬ª

[09:56] <AlexDaniel> so it now supports multifile gists

[09:56] <AlexDaniel> and that applies to *all* bots :)

[09:56] <AlexDaniel> well‚Ä¶ or maybe not xD

[09:57] <AlexDaniel> ah, I know why

[09:57] <AlexDaniel> of course

[09:57] <AlexDaniel> committable6: HEAD https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/c30fb599ee970d393edb9880df597449

[09:57] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äúheh.p6‚Äù had no .p6 extension, so of course it was ambiguous

[09:58] <AlexDaniel> so now it should be easier to bisect modules that are burnt before a release. Or at least in theory it should be this way

[10:36] <brrt> MasterDuke: I saw the announcement. It's actually a pretty cool idea, because it reuses a lot of well-tested paths

[10:37] <brrt> i mean, in ruby, writing a file, shelling out, and loading a dynamic libary must be done often

[10:37] <brrt> on the other hand, it isn't the fastest or the most secure route

[10:38] <brrt> not the fastest because it involves disk io and separate program startup

[10:38] <brrt> not the most secure because disk and compiler are now sources from wherein we can introduce arbitrary code into the process

[10:38] <brrt> I like our approach better, but as a first step this isn't bad at all

[11:10] <AlexDaniel> apparently I missed the news? Microsoft acquiring github? huh‚Ä¶

[11:11] <AlexDaniel> speaking of gitlab, older versions of gitlab have a toggle so that you can choose between old and new interfaces

[11:11] <AlexDaniel> and the old one is *much* more intuitive

[11:12] <AlexDaniel> hahaha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOXuOg9tQI

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> I did try https://notabug.org/ at some point but it just feels like an underdeveloped version of github

[11:14] <AlexDaniel> but the interface is very familiar right from the start

[12:58] <lizmat> .ask nine is this expected? "use List::Util:from<Perl5> <shuffle>; my @a = shuffle (^50); dd @a"   # does not shuffle at all

[12:58] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to nine.

[12:58] <lizmat> .ask nine but if I flatten the Range, it does work as expected: use List::Util:from<Perl5> <shuffle>; my @a = shuffle |(^50); dd @a

[12:58] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to nine.

[13:57] <nine> Well, how would Perl 5 know what to do with a range?

[13:57] <yoleaux> 12:58Z <lizmat> nine: is this expected? "use List::Util:from<Perl5> <shuffle>; my @a = shuffle (^50); dd @a"   # does not shuffle at all

[13:57] <yoleaux> 12:58Z <lizmat> nine: but if I flatten the Range, it does work as expected: use List::Util:from<Perl5> <shuffle>; my @a = shuffle |(^50); dd @a

[13:58] <lizmat> nine: Ah, I guess I expected too much magic then  :-)

[13:59] <lizmat> nine: does that also apply as to how Seqs are interpreted in Perl 5 ?  Or are they consumed and put into a list first ?

[14:00] <nine> There's no special handling for Seqs either. At least yet. Seems like argument slurping usually takes care of that for users. Otherwise I'd have seen some bug report about that by now.

[14:01] <nine> Of course I could just add special handling for things like Ranges. It would certainly make sense in your case. OTOH with every case added, there's the possibility that now a user cannot e.g. pass a Range object unharmed through some Perl 5 code.

[14:03] <lizmat> but what would that Range object be in Perl 5 land ?

[14:07] <nine> I'd just expand the list

[14:21] * brrt grumbles that we could of course build our own git hosting site, seeing as we're all hackers and that

[14:23] <lizmat> that we could doesn't mean that we should: there's a lot of maint work on hosting sites

[14:30] <brrt> true enough...

[14:31] <brrt> oh, gitprep looks kind of like a clone

[15:05] <nine> Is there a way to find out whether an nqp op like nqp::multicacheadd exists?

[15:09] <nine> use nqp; use QAST:from<NQP>; try nqp::getcomp("perl6").compile("use nqp; nqp::multicacheadd(0, 0, 0, 0);"); seems to do the trick

[17:21] <nine> EVALing a role at BEGIN time during precompilation of a module is apparently fine - as long as the role doesn't contain any methods :/

[17:28] <nebuchadnezzar> AlexDaniel: yes, Microsoft acquire GitHub for 7.5 Billion, I saw lots of toot on Mastodon about that subject.

[17:29] <AlexDaniel> hmmm decentralized microblogging

[17:30] <nebuchadnezzar> lizmat: In France we have a collective which promote group self hosting https://chatons.org/en (CHATONS means kitten ;-))

[17:34] <AlexDaniel> haha, toot

[17:35] <nine> After fixing the error in the error reporting code, I'm getting at the bottom: "Cannot mix in non-composable type Mu into object of type Int"

[17:37] <nine> Nope, that's not the original error either

[17:39] <nine> Looks more like it: Serialization Error: missing static code ref for closure '!LEXICAL_FIXUP_CSCOPE' ((null):1)

[18:14] <nine> Creating the role via meta model to avoid the closures ends up in: Could not instantiate role '<anon|1>':

[18:14] <nine> That's somehow less than helpful :)

[18:59] <lizmat> nine: doesn't ring a bell with me :-(
