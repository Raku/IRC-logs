[13:51] <Zoffix> lizmat_: is there a link to that discussion?

[13:51] <Zoffix> I wanna read

[13:52] <Zoffix> The (elem) on Range thing

[13:53] <Zoffix> m: say 42.5 (elem) 42..55

[13:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8abd6c401: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[13:53] <Zoffix> m: say 42.5 (elem) set 42..55

[13:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8abd6c401: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[13:54] <Zoffix> That feels weird to me. I'm using a setty operator, so I'd expect it to have setty semantics and 42.5 is not a member of the set created from that Range

[13:56] <Zoffix> This was previously mentioned, but I guess wasn't the primary topic of the Issue, so it was never covered by a test: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1593#issuecomment-371112159

[13:59] <Zoffix> I guess the discussion was in meatspace. There's some conf going on right now, eh?

[17:27] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in ≈3 days and ≈1 hour. 2 blockers. 81 out of 442 commits logged (⚠ 11 warnings)

[17:27] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Details: https://gist.github.com/7b528ed42490f963ccc4719bf6017229

[17:28] <AlexDaniel> \o/ that optimistic feeling :)

[17:57] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: you probably know that point already, but perl 6 name is good because it attracts perl 5 people. I myself came to perl 6 because I was using perl5 before that and perl 6 in some sense looked like perl5 but better.

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: also there are *lots* of people who used perl5 in the past and liked it (even if they don't use it now), so “perl 6” name can make them feel at home I think

[18:03] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I'm just rambling: perl 6 is a new language but it's probably easier for people to accept it as a real and serious programming language because it has “perl” in it and they've heard about it. Like there are hundreds of new and unfamiliar language names and most of them are probably not taken seriously

[18:05] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: Having nbsp in the name is fitting for a language that has good unicode support

[18:41] <timotimo> is there already a cool word for "bad boy/girl" but not implying boy vs girl vs something else

[19:30] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: TBH, that's probably *the only* thing I heard for why the "perl 6" name is beneficial, but I feel the people are just misinterpreting their own motivations.

[19:31] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: why didn't you go to CPerl or Perl11 or whatever other Perls are there? I thought I went to Perl 6 because of the name, but in reality it was that my involvent in perl 5 made me aware of a project that was meant to be the "next" version of Perl. I went to check out how it was doing. It's not its name that lured me to Perl 6, it's its history

[19:32] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: and accepting as "serious" can be done by slapping Larry's name next to it.  "The AwesomeLang, by Larry Wall"

[19:32] <Zoffix> And having nbsp in the name is a major pain in the ass.

[19:36] <Zoffix> TBH, I'm fairly disappointed by the responses to https://twitter.com/zoffix/status/1028977967454666758

[19:36] <Zoffix> I was hoping for tough, cogent argumentation and evidence, not anecdotes that all say the same thing (the same argument as above, which I find dubious)

[19:37] <AlexDaniel`> Zoffix: yeah not saying that these are great

[19:41] <timotimo> i hvae nothing good to contribute, alas

[19:43] <Zoffix> It's not super important, since we're not actually changing the name. I just thought to have "two sides of the story" so to speak, when I write down all the things for Larry to consider for marketing alias for 6.d release.

[19:47] <japhb> Zoffix: I've been around since the Perl 4 days.  I moved to Perl 5 and then to Perl 6 about when the previous one drove me nuts.

[19:47] <japhb> I no longer enjoy Perl 5 programming, but I still enjoy Perl 6 programming.  :-)
