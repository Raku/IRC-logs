[01:29] <samcv> ZofBot: help

[01:29] <ZofBot> samcv, I replaced Zoffix

[01:29] <samcv> oh ok

[01:29] <samcv> ZofBot: you are likely interested in problems with denormal support on the intel c compiler

[01:30] <samcv> i listed the failing nqp tests in #moarvm

[05:36] <samcv> solved the issue. nqp and roast are now giving full pass on spectest with intel c compiler. it was related to having to pass some flags to the compiler on float precision

[05:36] <samcv> once i found the correct ones

[09:52] <Tison> hi

[09:53] <Tison> I'm working on rakudo#1904, and find we build Datetime correctly, the problem is how we coerce Datetime to Str, but I cannot find it

[09:53] <synopsebot> RAKUDO#1904 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1904 DateTime Stringification sensitive to null milliseconds

[09:54] <Tison> In short, how we coerce Datetime to Str?

[09:55] <Tison> I mean the logic internal, cannot find a Str method in Datetime.pm6

[10:03] * Tison will be back about two hours later

[10:44] <yoleaux> 01:23Z <samcv> brrt: i'm getting lots of integer truncation and failing some integer tests in nqp using the ICC

[10:44] <brrt> oh, blimey

[10:45] <brrt> what have we broken

[10:47] *** robertle joined
[11:06] <nine> .tell Tison DateTime's Str method comes from the Dateish role

[11:06] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to Tison.

[11:20] <lizmat> .tell Tison what you're looking for is method !formatter , and it looks like the fraction is removed intentionally

[11:20] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to Tison.

[12:43] <tbrowder_> hi all

[12:44] <tbrowder_> any plans on new irc logging? i can offer a server online in the us if needed.

[12:45] <tbrowder_> its currently running freebsd

[12:49] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-06-05#l63

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> colabti has been there for a long time actually, just not on #perl6-dev and #moarvm

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> but logging new messages is not that big of a deal for me, I'd rather see all links to irc logs being revived

[12:51] <tbrowder_> ok, so all is ok now?

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> not exactly, but see this: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-06-05#l17
