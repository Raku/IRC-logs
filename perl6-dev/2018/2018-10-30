[13:17] <jnthn> Hmm, startup time seems to have gotten worse sometime recently

[13:18] <timotimo> wow, yeah, 0.2s instead of the usual 0.1s is what i'm seeing

[13:22] <timotimo> "perf report" shows MVM_string_ascii_encode_substr at a surprisingly high place

[13:22] <timotimo> i put a breakpoint and got some very long strings that look a bit like base64 perhaps

[13:23] <jnthn> o.O

[13:23] <timotimo>    at <unknown>:1  (/home/timo/perl6/install/share/nqp/lib/QRegex.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)

[13:24] <timotimo> const_s, then some invoke, then deserialize

[13:24] <timotimo> didn't we kick out base64 strings as blobs?

[13:25] <jnthn> Yes

[13:25] <jnthn> Hmm, there's MoarVM commit e92f6572e58f99b8

[13:26] <timotimo> i believe nine explained what's going on there on IRC around the time of the commit, but i'd expect it's been rebased a few times

[13:26] <timotimo> so you can't find it by id any more, should still be findable based on the comment

[13:27] <jnthn> Well, the code in NQP does this:

[13:27] <jnthn>                 nqp::isnull_s($serialized)

[13:27] <jnthn>                     ?? QAST::Op.new( :op('null_s') )

[13:27] <jnthn>                     !! QAST::SVal.new( :value($serialized) ),

[13:28] <jnthn> That is, checks if there's no base64'd stuff, and if there is, uses the string, otherwise uses null so it will find it in the bytecode file

[13:29] <jnthn> I'm wondering if the change that's in MoarVM HEAD works out OK with the changes in some NQP branch that switches the code-gen over to the new mechanism, but with NQP master results in it doing this less efficient serialization

[13:29] <jnthn> In which case I guess that work is close to merge anyway, so "wait a bit" might be a reasonable answer.

[13:30] <timotimo> right

[13:32] <jnthn> Just a rebase :)

[13:32] <timotimo> how old was that code? i don't even remember seeing it the last time

[13:33] <jnthn> I started working on it..hmm, earlier this month?

[13:35] <nine> IOW ancient

[13:37] <nine> Oh, that base64 stuff was not exactly intentional. A later commit in my branch makes it obsolete anyway. I'll have a look probably tomorrow.

[13:39] <jnthn> nine++

[13:39] <nine> Unfortunately I lost a day because my desktop wouldn't start anymore. Spent hours tinkering with the hardware and only the very last thing I tried before sending the mainboard off to a 4 week long warranty replacement trip brought it back to life - clearing the CMOS

[13:40] <jnthn> Wow

[13:40] <timotimo> oh wow

[13:40] <jnthn> 1 day is better than 4 weeks, at least...

[13:40] <timotimo> is that the same thing that lets you b0rk an efi bios by putting something in some register even though the spec allows for it? that's like 2 years old at the very least

[13:40] <nine> Thing just wouldn't turn on anymore. Not even a flicker of one of the LEDs or any movement of a fan.

[13:41] <timotimo> have you ever had a POST card? like that would output the state somehow?

[13:41] <nine> Thing is...I didn't do anything :) Turned it off in the morning and when I came back from work it was bricked

[13:41] <nine> The mainboard has it even integrated :) But not even that would turn on

[13:41] <timotimo> wow

[13:41] <jnthn> It's been years since I sent a postcard...

[13:42] <timotimo> try it again, i'm sure people would be delighted to receive one :)

[13:42] <timotimo> "oh how quaint. ol' jonathan has always been into this retro technology"

[13:45] <jnthn> oh ffs

[13:45] <jnthn> sub throws-like($code, $ex_type, $reason?, *%matcher) is export {

[13:45] <jnthn> ...

[13:46] <jnthn> EVAL $code, context => CALLER::CALLER::CALLER::CALLER::;

[13:46] <jnthn> Now consider this test:

[13:46] <jnthn>     my $baz of Int;

[13:46] <jnthn>     throws-like q[$baz = 'xyz'], X::TypeCheck::Assignment, 'of Int restricts to integers';

[13:46] <jnthn> So, Test.pm6 is using something unsupported.

[13:47] <jnthn> I bet this is why so many spectests blow up with the new opt

[13:47] <timotimo> hah

[13:47] <timotimo> should it put a my $context := CALLER::<enough times>::; at the very start of throws-like perhaps?

[13:48] <jnthn> throws-like is from a completely different compilation unit

[13:48] <timotimo> well, yeah, but what about inner blocks?

[13:48] <timotimo> oh, they aren't even considered for CALLER, right?

[13:48] <jnthn> They are but the compiler sees use of CALLER:: and disables all block inlining opts

[13:49] <jnthn> Lexical use of CALLER:: is fine, we can see it 

[13:49] <timotimo> oh, so it's about actually the caller's layout

[13:50] *** lizmat left
[13:50] <jnthn> The lexical to local lowering opt means that the $baz there goes away

[13:50] <jnthn> It doesn't exist as a lexical any more

[13:51] <timotimo> oh!

[13:51] <timotimo> that's what's happening

[13:51] <timotimo> jeez

[13:51] <jnthn> Things are spec'd so as to make alright

[13:51] <jnthn> *make this

[13:51] <jnthn> But Test.pm6 is using a non-spec feature

[13:52] <timotimo> context of EVAL?

[13:52] <jnthn> Yes

[13:53] *** lizmat joined
[13:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lizmat

[13:54] <timotimo> i'm not entirely sure why that uses a string instead of a curly block

[13:54] <timotimo> to prevent the optimizer from complaining early?

[13:54] <jnthn> yeah, I guess

[13:54] <jnthn> But it could do the EVAL in the curly block

[13:55] <timotimo> not a bad idea i think

[13:55] <jnthn> As a hack, I've stuck throws-like into the list of poison calls to see how many spectests still fail

[13:55] <jnthn> Plenty do, so there's obviously more I need to fix

[13:56] <timotimo> that doesn't sound fun :|

[13:57] <jnthn> Why do you think I put off working on this until I really need it to make PEA worthwhile? :P

[13:57] <timotimo> it all makes sense

[14:58] <AlexDaniel> moritz: ↑ any idea?

[15:02] <moritz> AlexDaniel: about what? is there something wrong?

[15:10] <timotimo> why everything is called [email@hidden.address]
[15:11] <moritz> ah, likely a programming error

[15:12] <lizmat> m: my %m is Map = a => { b => 42 }; dd %m; %m<a><b> = 666; dd %m  # feels to me that should die

[15:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: OUTPUT: «Map.new((:a({:b(42)})))␤Map.new((:a({:b(666)})))␤»

[15:12] <timotimo> deep immutability is Really Hard™

[15:12] <jnthn> But Map doesn't promise that :)

[15:12] <lizmat> well, atm this is perhaps also a syntax thing

[15:12] <jnthn> And { b => 42 } is quite clearly a mutable Hash

[15:13] <timotimo> right

[15:13] <timotimo> do we want syntax for a map literal? like we do for object hashes?

[15:13] <lizmat> but we don't have syntax for a Map

[15:13] <lizmat> well, perhaps we do ?

[15:13] <moritz> Map.new

[15:13] <jnthn> m: my %m is Map = a => Map(b => 42); dd %m; %m<a><b> = 666; dd %m

[15:14] <lizmat> yeah, I realize I can do that...

[15:14] <lizmat> still, for initializing multi-level Map's, that's sorta LTA

[15:14] <moritz> timotimo, AlexDaniel: fix forthcoming

[15:16] <lizmat> I guess this looks like module space and a "is immutable" trait :-)

[15:19] <timotimo> immumap

[15:19] <lizmat> it would also do arrays: https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Tuple:cpan:ELIZABETH

[15:48] <synopsebot> R#2447 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2447 Map can have a changing ValueObjAt

[15:52] <jnthn> lizmat: I'm not so keen on that

[15:53] <jnthn> Though may be even less keen on alternatives :P

[15:54] <lizmat> well, *if* we're going to do this, then we could also do it for List.WHICH

[15:54] <jnthn> I don't think a type changing its value nature based on content is right

[15:54] <lizmat> which would solve a lot of issues for some people  and remove one of the reasons for the existence of Tuple

[15:55] <jnthn> It feels rather too unpredictable

[15:55] <lizmat> true

[15:55] <jnthn> Plus it's actually OK to have a value type refer to things that are reference types and just care about their object identity

[15:55] <lizmat> perhaps we need a fully immutable Tuple type, and a fully immutable Dict type ?

[15:55] <jnthn> For example, storing tuples of two objects

[15:56] <lizmat> why would that be ok ?

[15:57] <lizmat> if you change one of the objects, shouldn't that change the WHICH of the tuple ?

[16:00] <jnthn> No

[16:00] <jnthn> Not if the objects are reference types

[16:00] <jnthn> Imagine my objects are nodes and I want to have a set of arrows between them

[16:02] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: hmmm these bumps look a bit wrong to me

[16:02] <AlexDaniel> some pre-release commits there

[16:03] <AlexDaniel> the description I mean, the bumps themselves are ok

[16:04] <lizmat> jnthn: should (1, 42) be a value type?   (1,my $ = 42) ?  (1,Node.new()) ?

[16:04] <jnthn> lizmat: Given we don't consider List to be one, then no

[16:05] <jnthn> That's entirely what I'm arguing :)

[16:05] <jnthn> If we had a Tuple type, then the answer for all the above would be "yes" if those we made as tuples instead.

[16:05] <lizmat> ok, how about Map (which we *do* consider to be a value type atm)

[16:06] <jnthn> I'm not convinced it should be one, tbh
