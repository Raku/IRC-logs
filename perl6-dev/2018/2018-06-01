[16:22] <nine> I like this a bit better already. Even better if there was a way to not have to manually call nqp::hllize. But I could live with that :)

[16:42] <lizmat> https://commaide.com/supporter-program  # open for business !

[16:48] <nine> Now if only there was a way to patch old rakudos with that :/

[16:58] <nine> I don't see much of a way besides copying half of rakudo's Metamodel code into Inline::Perl5

[17:04] <lizmat> nine: maybe it's time to lift the Metamodel code to Perl 6 in its entirety?

[17:08] <nine> lizmat: I guess that would be quite a bootstrap challenge

[17:09] <lizmat> indeed it would  :-(
