[21:20] <Zoffix> Time to make some toast...

[21:24] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: interestingly, p6lert *bot* is leaking even faster than the web app (it's at 1200MB vs 1012MB for the app), yet the other bots, like geth, don't seem to be leaking

[21:25] <Zoffix> ahh, it has its own perl6

[21:25] <Zoffix> 2017.12-58-g418fc068f for p6lert vs 2018.03-148-g916b41a21 for geth

[21:38] <Zoffix> .seen jnthn

[21:38] <yoleaux> I saw jnthn 14:46Z in #moarvm: <jnthn> Can't say I've noticed it doing so, but I've hardly run spectest at all in the last couple of weeks.

[21:38] * Zoffix looks at the blockers and ponders our bus factor :}

[21:39] <Zoffix> The big-endian stuff... Do you actually have to have a big ending CPU or can that be emulated in a VM or something?

[21:40] <Zoffix> TIL big/little-endian is about which end to crack a boiled egg to eat it...

[21:41] <geekosaur> it can be emulated but software only except on one of the CPU archs that can switch (mips, ppc, arm iirc)

[21:48] <Zoffix> aye google-fu tells me I can use QEMU to do that

[22:31] <Zoffix> 2018.03 toast finished. So, it takes 70-minutes per commit to run it (on 64-cores)

[22:31] <Zoffix> m: say 4*70/64

[22:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72b54ddd6: OUTPUT: «18.666667␤»

[22:33] <Zoffix> or 18⅔ hours on 4-core box

[23:41] <Zoffix> buggable: toast

[23:41] <buggable> Zoffix, Between 2018.03-234-g72b54dd and 2018.03: 13 (1.28%) modules got burnt; 17 (1.67%) got unsucced; 288 (28.26%) out of 1019 modules appear unusable. See https://toast.perl6.party/ for details.

[23:42] <Zoffix> Looks like a bunch of them are just tests that rely on our old buggy num stringification

[23:44] <timotimo> mhm

[23:45] <timotimo> Method 'iterator' must be implemented by Iterable because it is required by roles: Iterable.

[23:46] <timotimo> this is about punning Iterable accidentally?

[23:47] <timotimo> # expected: 'six point zero two two times ten to the twenty-third'

[23:47] <timotimo> #      got: 'six point zero two two zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one times ten to the twenty-third'

[23:47] <Zoffix> That too is a num thing

[23:48] <timotimo> yep

[23:48] <timotimo> just looks very funny

[23:48] <Zoffix> :)
