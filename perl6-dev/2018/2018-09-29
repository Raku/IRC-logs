[00:00] <timotimo> huh, we're not bad

[00:07] <MasterDuke> ruby took 309s

[00:13] <timotimo> we've got some catching up to do, clearly

[00:13] <timotimo> hey, what happens if you run fib(4) a thousand times before doing the fib(46)?

[00:14] <MasterDuke> i'll tell you once python finishes

[00:14] <timotimo> thank you kindly

[00:40] <TimToady> we should recognize the code for fib and optimize it to [*] 2..$n  :)

[00:40] <TimToady> er, that's factorial

[00:40] <TimToady> 0,1,*+*...* rather

[00:42] <geekosaur> optimizing for benchmarks. it's like I'm back in database land again :)

[00:43] <TimToady> a general optimization that turns recursive definitions into iterative ones would perhaps be more appropriate :)

[00:57] <MasterDuke> timotimo: with a thousand fib(4)s before the fib(46) it took 1312s

[00:57] <MasterDuke> so 20s slower than not having them

[00:58] <MasterDuke> hm, that may just be it slowing down because of heat, the thousand fib(4)s by themselves only take 0.2s

[01:00] <MasterDuke> m: say (0,1,*+*...*)[47]; say now - INIT now

Because in that commit we spec Lock::Async.unlock to throw if not locked, but IO::Handle.unlock silently does nothing. Was wondering if this asymetry is acceptable.

[18:01] <jnthn> Zoffix: I guess there's more than one way to read "ran ahead of" and you're reading it the way other than it was meant :)

[18:01] <jnthn> Basically, did it not produce a ton of elements beyond those required

[18:02] <jnthn> Which a previous supply/react impl woulda done

[18:02] <Zoffix> ok thanks

[18:03] <jnthn> I'm trying to think of a better wording...

[18:03] <jnthn> supply block ran cooperatively with consume, perhaps

[18:03] <jnthn> loking

[18:04] <jnthn> yeah, that works
