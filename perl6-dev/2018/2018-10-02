[13:38] <dogbert2> jnthn: are you on an optimizing spree again :)

[13:43] <jnthn> Actually having a look at https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/975 first

[13:46] <dogbert2> cool

[13:47] <jnthn> OSR issue, it seems :S

[13:52] <dogbert2> difficult?

[13:54] <jnthn> Well, it gets stranger: it only SEGVs sometimes and at the spesh limit where it seems to start

[13:54] <jnthn> *start doing so

[13:54] <jnthn> But that isn't for something doing OSR

[13:54] <jnthn> It's actually the specialization of bless

[13:55] <dogbert2> it doesn't have anything to do with https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/782 I guess

[13:56] <jnthn> And of course, under GDB it doesn't at all

[13:56] <dogbert2> hmm

[13:56] <jnthn> No

[13:57] * jnthn tries a debug/asan build

[13:59] <jnthn> bah, that only found me a leak :P

[13:59] <dogbert2> I still get it, same as in the report, i.e. static_frame=0x0 (running on 32 bit atm)

[14:00] <jnthn> It's odd, I get it reliably if I remove the spesh limit

[14:01] <dogbert2> in gdb as well?

[14:03] <jnthn> Probably, got an ASAN trace

[14:09] <jnthn> It's a bit odd....it's the fastinvoke that is blowing up

[14:09] <jnthn> I wonder where it gets its code object from...

[14:11] <jnthn> Yeah, null static frame

[14:15] <jnthn> The code object is happily in gen2, so it's not some nursery oddness

[14:22] <jnthn> Yeah...very much so

[14:22] <jnthn> However, the pieces do fit together somewhat

[14:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[14:23] <dogbert2> what about the connection to the bisected commit?

[14:23] <jnthn> In so far as we're in the specialized `bless` that the spesh bissect pointed to

[14:23] <jnthn> As the point we SEGV

[14:23] <jnthn> So the pieces go together...I just dunno what's happening :)

[14:26] <dogbert2> have you managed to catch it in gdb yet?

[14:27] <jnthn> Yeah

[14:28] <dogbert2> but it doesn't help ...

[14:28] <jnthn> Well, it confirms we're in the specialized bless when it goes wrong

[14:32] <jnthn> Oh my...

[14:33] <jnthn> fastinvoke is meant to be passed a VM-level code ref

[14:34] <jnthn> But instead it's being passed a high level code object...but it just indexes it as if it were the VM-level code ref

[14:34] <jnthn> So the NULL static_frame is actually the empty mixin slot for a P6opaque

[16:00] <lizmat> jnthn: have you considered just assigning the default values in object creation, and then let any specification overwrite that ?

[16:02] <jnthn> No, because the default value might not be a value :)

[16:03] <jnthn> It might be a computation, which might cost something or (horrors) have side-effects 

[16:03] <lizmat> ah, ok, yeah, right

[16:04] *** fake_space_whale left
[16:07] <lizmat> jnthn: how about an integer that serves as a bitmap to mark values being set, and each attribute having an offset

[16:08] <jnthn> Yeah, but how do you know when it's being set?

[16:08] <lizmat> generate it in the QAST to (re)set that bit

[16:08] <lizmat> basically: at compile time generate a bitmap with all bits set of attributes that have default values

[16:09] <jnthn> On every attribute bind, given BUILD could potentially call any method? Or static analysis to cope with that?

[16:09] <jnthn> And just try and transform the methods that need it?

[16:09] <lizmat> ah, yes, BUILD  :-(

[16:09] <jnthn> (This could potentially work, until somebody is too clever for their own good, I guess :))

[16:10] <jnthn> We do absolutely forbid any attribute access from outside of the class though

[16:10] <jnthn> So we can potentially do a static analysis and call it good enough

[16:10] <lizmat> my idea would only work if there is no BUILD

[16:10] <lizmat> but that's what we're talking about anyway, right?

[16:10] <jnthn> No, BUILD factors in to this also

[16:11] <jnthn> I'm just saying we might be able to cope with BUILD too
