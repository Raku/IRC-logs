[12:32] <pmurias> MasterDuke: also I'm not sure if the getpid reflection using code ported from the jvm backend is a good idea :/

[12:33] <pmurias> Java 9 has a proper api for that but GraalVM is java 8 :(

[12:37] <tbrowder_> AlexDaniel: i need some guidance and a decision about an unspecced S26 pod feature: the ‚Äò#‚Äô, in abbreviated blocks, as a sorthand for the config :numbered key (because abbreviated blocks contents start immediately following their typename and thus cannot have config info on the =typename line).

[12:37] <tbrowder_> s/sorthand/shorthand/

[12:40] <tbrowder_> S26 says the ‚Äò#‚Äô must be the first ws-delmited word in the block contents and that may be on the line following the =typname line.

[12:42] <tbrowder_> that causes no problems with most blocks, but with some it complicates parsing significantly, e.g., =table, =code.

[12:43] <tbrowder_> i would like to tighten the prescription to *require* the ‚Äò#‚Äô to be on the same line with the =typename.

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> RT#128498

[16:37] <synopsebot> RT#128498 [new]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128498 [POD]6 doesn't recognize '#' following "=headN" keywords per S26

[16:40] <tbrowder_> I just sent an e-mail msg to Damian Conway (author of S26). In it I referenced the gist posted above.

[16:42] <MasterDuke> pmurias: fwiw, i'm getting some `Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/jvm/stage2/QRegex.nqp' (for a couple files) when running things with truffle

[16:42] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: maybe the best idea would be to start a new RFC ticket, because the whole thing seems questionable to me

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: not just # on same line vs as first word, but the whole idea of using # for :numbered

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> greppable6: \:numbered

[16:47] <timotimo> sometimes it's the little things

[16:49] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: for example, why can't it be a dot as a shortcut?

[16:49] <AlexDaniel> not arguing that it must be a dot, but still, why #?

[18:26] <TimToady> lizmat: I agree with timotimo++ on the range matching being purely lexicographic; no iteration or set/junction logic is implied in our smartmatching because we have convenient ways to make those ideas explicit in p6

[18:26] <TimToady> they didn't have those in p5, so made the mistake of designing their smartmatching with all sorts of implicit behavior that is difficult to reason about

[18:27] <TimToady> what we might tighten up at some point is the notion that "A".."Z" promotes to "A"..."Z" in explicitly iterating contexts

[18:28] <TimToady> we allowed it because p5 people expect for 1..10 to mean 1...10, but the case for promoting non-numerics is weaker than for numerics

[18:29] <timotimo> right, we don't want to iterate through all reals between 1 and 10 for 1..10, even though every real in between will smartmatch to the range

[18:29] <timotimo> and ABCDE is a little bit like 1.2345 in that respect

[18:30] <timotimo> except we have what's basically "big floats" with strings

[18:44] <jdv79> timotimo: wow.  that last blog post is disturbing.

[18:44] <jdv79> "here's how to get p6 to be faster - don't use regexes"

[18:44] <timotimo> it's the sad truth at the moment

[18:44] <jdv79> that's exactly the opposite of how i think with p5 and about "Perl"

[18:44] <jdv79> oof

[18:44] <timotimo> i'd say it's more like "don't use regex for trivial little pieces" at the moment

[18:44] <timotimo> like, don't match /a/ if you can match "a"

[18:45] <jdv79> well, my use case in my module isn't trivial but it suffers the same issue.

[18:45] <jdv79> i can just imagine the reponses from people if i said "use perl6 but don't use regexes"

[18:46] <jdv79> haha

[18:46] <timotimo> it's not always necessary to go for maximum performance, fortunately

[18:46] <samcv> timotimo: in iterating contexts, if it's not assigned to a variable it acts identically right?

[18:46] <samcv> 'A'...'Z' compared to 'A'..'Z'?

[18:46] <jdv79> i think its so amusing to me because leveraging the regex engine in p5 is a real optimization strat.

[18:46] <timotimo> what, exactly?

[18:46] <timotimo> oh, yes i believe so

[18:47] <timotimo> we'll reach a point like that, i'm sure

[18:47] <timotimo> that regex will be something to reach for if you want good performance

[18:47] <jdv79> hopefully.  its not proven afaik.  but that would be cool.

[18:47] <timotimo> yes, it's not proven

[18:48] <timotimo> but i don't see why we couldn't get much better than we currently are

[18:48] <jdv79> but is it reasonable to think it will get as good as or better than p5's regex perf?

[18:48] <jdv79> that'd  be interesting

[18:48] <timotimo> in theory, we do have a jit compiler. i don't know how much that's worth, because i don't know how p5's regex guts are implemented

[18:49] <jdv79> afaik pretty crazy c

[18:49] <timotimo> but it still acts a bit like an interpreter?

[18:49] <jdv79> i can't read it at all though

[18:49] <jdv79> i believe so - some sort of nfa

[18:50] <timotimo> ah, yes, we only use NFA for LTM at the moment, if i'm not mistaken

[18:50] <timotimo> not everything can be mapped, after all

[18:50] <tbrowder_> TimToady: are you not in favor of the '#' for the short cut? I've gotten a favorable response from Damian, but I will point out any disagreement if you want me to.

[18:53] <tbrowder_> I've invited him to visit but he said he doesn't use social media (smart man!).

[18:54] <TimToady> the funny thing is that p5's regex engine uses the same strategy internally by avoiding the actual regex engine when it knows of literals that must match

[18:54] <TimToady> we just haven't done that optimization yet in p6

[18:56] <TimToady> that's not to say we can't improve the actual regex engine as well

[18:57] <TimToady> tbrowder_: just sayin' we've been very, very careful in the rest of the language anywhere a # might possibly be confused as a comment

[18:58] <TimToady> and it just seems kind of a low-leverage feature to be violating that

[18:59] * TimToady used to say "low wattage" until that became a feature with LED bulbs :)

[18:59] <pmurias> .tell MasterDuke re nqp::istrue_s it not defined in nqp because it's not used by a QAST::Op but only in a lower level MAST

[18:59] <yoleaux> pmurias: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[18:59] <pmurias> .tell MasterDuke re Missing dependency message that's because the setting isn't properly cross compiled and loaded yet

[18:59] <yoleaux> pmurias: I'll pass your message to MasterDuke.

[19:01] <tbrowder_> understood, thanks. so far i've been able to make the grammar recognize the '#' in the abbreviated format okay (subject to the restriction to use only on the first line). we'll have to see on the other block formats.

[19:01] <TimToady> "All things are possible, but not all things are expedient." ‚ÄîSt. Paul

[19:02] <pmurias> jdv79: re good or better performance than p5 regex it's definitely doable

[19:02] <tbrowder_> and damian definitely uses the '#' liberally in S26. i'll  send on your comments. do you have a character you would suggest as a more suitable replacement?

[19:04] <TimToady> I'll have to look at S26 again

[19:05] <TimToady> I mostly ignored it when it first came out because there were too many other things going on in the rest of the language...

[19:05] <tbrowder_> ok, thank you  (and thanks for St. Paul)

[22:15] <tbrowder_> thinking out loud about pod, i like the asterisk better than the octothorpe for the shortcut :numbered config option. it stands out, but it doesn‚Äôt have the baggage of the ‚Äò#‚Äô being largely thought of as the *nix/perl comment. but, as S26 mentions, all pod is essentially a comment anyway.
