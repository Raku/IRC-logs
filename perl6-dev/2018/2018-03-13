[00:09] <Kaiepi> anyone want an eval function for PufferBot?

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: just run whateverable on freebsd?

[00:54] <AlexDaniel> like maybe committable and bisectable

[00:54] <Kaiepi> what do they offer for features?

[00:54] <AlexDaniel> committable6: wiki

[00:54] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Committable

[00:55] <Kaiepi> wait i could just look it up

[00:59] <AlexDaniel> it may be a bit difficult to set them up (mainly because nobody else ever needed to), but I can help

[00:59] <AlexDaniel> but I wonder if freebsd is different enough to need a evalbot?

[00:59] <AlexDaniel> I actually don't know

[01:00] * AlexDaniel is more interested to see an evalbot for big endian systems :)

[04:30] <Kaiepi> got my freebsd vps is up. BeastieBot will be coming soon for testing rakudo
