[13:31] <yoleaux> 12:45Z <tbrowder_> AlexDaniel: it looks like the two main toaster hangers right now are OO::Actors and Test::Scheduler, both of which hang while testing in a local repo with the latest stable Rakudo. The other two hangers pass local testing.

[13:31] <AlexDaniel> “And yesterday, rakudo and nqp were removed from Debian/testing because of the build issues on mips and armhf :-(”

[13:34] * lizmat about to lose the last drop of battery

[21:23] <tbrowder_> AlexDaniel:  btw, yesterday i saw one segv during a rakudo compile of the master branch. the next attempt worked ok. no problem with lack of ram.

[21:24] <tbrowder_> wasn’t smart enough to take notes

[21:38] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: don't know if there's anything we can do about it

[21:38] <AlexDaniel> maybe someone can run rakudo build in a loop or something

[21:40] <tbrowder_> is the random segv problem still lurking as an unknown?

[21:41] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: what do you mean?

[21:41] * lizmat waves from Wanzleben

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: I think most segvs that we know of have reasonably good ways of reproducing them

[21:42] <tbrowder_> wasn’t there a segv rakudo bug flapping recently?

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> even whateverable does now: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1259#issuecomment-371295503

[21:46] <tbrowder_> ok, that’s what i remember...i’ll try a basic build loop for awhile and see what happens

[22:31] <lizmat> japhb: they were mostly within noise

[22:31] <lizmat> or just slightly above it, at least for me

[22:32] <lizmat> hmmm... perl6.org and friends appear to be down for me

[22:38] <MasterDuke> i saw a segv in travis recently, looked pretty random

[22:44] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[22:46] <MasterDuke> i think it was for one of lizmat++'s commits yesterday

[22:46] <lizmat> yeah, could't reproduce it myself

[22:46] <MasterDuke> all the other configurations of that travis run were fine

[22:46] <lizmat> then again, I see flappers in odd files whe doing spectests all the time  :-(

[22:47] <MasterDuke> yep, i get those also (though a lot less frequently than i used to)

[23:49] <MasterDuke> lizmat: any thoughts on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1642 ?
