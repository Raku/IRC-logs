[09:55] <yoleaux> 3 Feb 2018 23:33Z <Zoffix> nine: *I* didn't get the error. It only happens on Travis. And to get the error to print, I had to make temporary modifications to X::Comp::BeginTime to printe the message from a Failure being stuffed into a `str` attribute: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/2339d8dd00

[09:57] <nine> Zoffix: also do you have any idea at all how a Failure can end up in $.use-case? All the code paths I see where we throw an X::Comp::BeginTime some static string is passed into :use-case

[10:09] <Zoffix> nine: IIRC travis checks PRs. So you could cherry-pick your $*PERL commit into a branch and PR it and it'd test that branch. No idea how a Failure could end up in that param.
