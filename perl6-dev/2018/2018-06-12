[11:07] <tbrowder_> g’day, #perl6-dev

[11:09] <tbrowder_> my PR #1914 is a no-op but a starting point for adding a pod slang. i would like to merge it if there are no objections.

[11:12] <AlexDaniel> hm, if it's a no-op, why merge it?

[11:17] <tbrowder_> well, it makes the upcoming move obvious, and it makes it easier to keep a branch in sync with master.

[11:18] <tbrowder_> i would also like to break out some more of the current grammar and actions into separate files if that is acceptable.

[11:20] <tbrowder_> basically separate the classes into separate files...

[11:20] <lizmat> tbrowder_++  :-)

[11:22] <tbrowder_> lizmat: thnx! i’ll work on more splitting then if that’s an amen.

[11:22] <lizmat> that's an amen from me: making that stuff more digestable for maintenance is a definite plus

[11:22] <tbrowder_> ok! game on!

[11:27] <tbrowder_> lizmat: i’ll start by merging PR #1914 if that’s ok
