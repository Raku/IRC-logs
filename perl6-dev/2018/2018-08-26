[02:13] <fake_space_whale> Per the CONTRIBUTING.md, I am nudging this channel to perhaps get some feedback on my pull request https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/2225 . Though if you're busy with other stuff that is fine.

[02:30] <MasterDuke> fake_space_whale: now's a pretty slow time of day. and i suspect people are waiting until after the release (which looks like it might be tomorrow)

[02:31] <fake_space_whale> thanks, that makes sense. I am happy to wait.

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: master is open, there's no need to wait

[02:58] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: I looked at the PR

[02:58] <fake_space_whale> oh?

[02:58] <AlexDaniel> ↑ I don't think it covers this case

[02:58] <fake_space_whale> I'll go test that

[03:00] <fake_space_whale> you are correct

[03:01] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: +1 for nudging :) Although, yeah, at this time of a day people are mostly asleep

[03:02] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: honestly I'm not fully aware of that syntax, what else is allowed besides <-> and ['-'] ?

[03:02] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: <<->> is valid

[03:02] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: and «-» also

[03:03] <fake_space_whale> What version are you using to get that <<->> is valid?

[03:08] <fake_space_whale> no I made a mistake when I was writing it locally

[03:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[03:11] <fake_space_whale> is there a name for the thing which <<->> <-> ["-"] are examples of?

[03:11] <fake_space_whale> like are they associative references?

[03:13] *** Ven` left
[03:25] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: maybe `coloncircumfix`

[03:25] <AlexDaniel> fake_space_whale: --target=parse like this: perl6 --target=parse -e 'say (42).:["-"]'

[03:25] <AlexDaniel> try* :)

[03:26] <fake_space_whale> Thank you :D

[03:27] <AlexDaniel> everything from `dottyop` to `circumfix` should work I think, depending on how big you want your shotgun to be for this operation

[11:46] *** Guest85043 joined
[11:47] <tbrowder_> i need some advice on current handling of pod: spec testing allows an empty paragraph block (“=for”) but i think that should throw an exception

[11:48] <tbrowder_> that test is in roast S26*/03-abbreviated.t

[11:49] *** Guest85043 left
[11:50] <tbrowder_> sorry, it is an abbreviated block (“=foo”) which is allowed to be empty

[11:51] <tbrowder_> i guess one could have a use case for it except for one problem: lower names are reserved according to speculation S26

[11:53] <tbrowder_> thus, one way or another, i don’t think the test should pass

[11:56] <tbrowder_> please leave any comments with a .tell or .ask
