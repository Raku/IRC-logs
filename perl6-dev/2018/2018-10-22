[00:04] <MasterDuke> what about github?

[00:05] <timotimo> status.github.com

[00:06] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: tbrowder self-unassigned @.allowed array in class Pod::Block::Code is unneeded https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2413

[00:06] <MasterDuke> huh, i didn't notice anything until just after going to the status page

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I look at R#2406 and it says that it is still open

[00:35] <synopsebot> R#2406 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2406 [JVM][⚠ blocker ⚠] JVM fails to build

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> I think I even left a comment there already, but I don't see it

[00:35] <AlexDaniel> oh see, synopsebot also thinks that it is open

[00:36] <AlexDaniel> it was closed like 1 hour ago :)

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> can't see latest commits unless you have a direct link

[00:38] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: btw don't know if you noticed: https://github.com/perl6/Blin

[00:39] <AlexDaniel> so it's a tool for bisecting modules locally, and you can do that for the whole ecosystem if you like

[00:48] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: very cool

[02:30] <yoleaux> I saw TisonKun 18 Sep 2018 06:06Z in #perl6: <TisonKun> tyil: you are right, but here I want a more exactly method that must be invoked by a class, not instance.

[03:01] <AlexDaniel> heh, I wonder what went wrong this time. I've never seen issues that bad with github

[05:47] <nine> timotimo: actually the numification happens already without the int on $primspec. Even worse, we numify it once for every comparison. The int fixes that :) I've even tried it before but got thrown off by a type related error elsewhere. NQP is quite unforgiving and really less than helpful when dealing with ints or much worse, unsigneds.

[05:57] <nine> AlexDaniel: no, the resource file name is entirely dependent on the distribution it came from. Nothing to do with rakudo version

[06:10] <nine> timotimo: NQP is so incredibly dumb about numeric types :( We get an int, box it, decont it immediately and numify it just to coerce it to unsigned. And of course coerce_nu is not implemented in the JIT, so it bails on that.

[06:11] *** fake_space_whale left
[06:14] <nine> timotimo: the whole dance is completely unnecessary as the value in question is MAST::Local's $!index which would have been an uint all along. It's even a box_target now. I wish I knew how to avoid this...

[14:35] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: so for release, we're just waiting for someone who can resolve the blockers?

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: in some sense, yes. I'm working on the changelog right now

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: status

[14:36] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release will happen when it's ready. 3 blockers. 87 out of 489 commits logged (⚠ 3 warnings)

[14:36] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Details: https://gist.github.com/1878905bcd909cd68ca02c3c06451561

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> eh 3? I only see 2

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> poor github

[14:36] <AlexDaniel> ah ok it's 3 now

[14:37] <Zoffix> It should be 2

[14:37] <Zoffix> One of which is something half the people who looked at couldn't be able to repro and OP isn't responding

[14:38] * Zoffix was asking about release 'cause of wanting to bump Rakudo's default lang to d :)

[14:41] <AlexDaniel> ahhh :)

[14:41] <AlexDaniel> the issue with Crane is worth fixing IMO

[14:41] <Zoffix> Yeah

[14:42] <Zoffix> The bus factor is fairly large here. 'cause it's probably a simple fix

[14:43] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: with the other ticket you said you repro-ed a segfault on HEAD, right?

[14:43] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: yeah.

[14:44] <Zoffix> Though for all we know, there's a data race in OP's code and it's simply easier to trigger on HEAD because of all the optimizations.

[14:44] <Zoffix> Like, there's no golfed code, just a giant app
