[18:34] <Zoffix> Was kinda expecting it to DWIM and .STORE into that array

[18:39] <synopsebot> R#2310 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2310 [LTA] LTA assignment to `$_` alised to Array does not .STORE

[18:41] <TimToady> in any case, it's not exactly an immutable value, so the error message is LTA

[18:42] <TimToady> m: my @a = <a b c d f b g e>; @$_ = 42 with @a;

[18:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22edce40: ( no output )

[18:42] <TimToady> in the design, the scalar vs list assignment is determined statically, so maybe the error should just point them at @$_

[18:43] <Zoffix> m: use nqp; my @a = <a b c d f b g e>; nqp::p6store($_,42) with @a; dd @a

[18:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22edce40: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [42]␤»

[18:43] <TimToady> we could make it failover, but too many failovers is a design smell

[18:43] <Zoffix> It could use that op, no? Tho I feer it'll impact perf

[18:44] <TimToady> well, probably only if it prevents inlining

[18:44] <Zoffix> m: my $a := [<a b c d f b g e>]; $a = 42; dd $a

[18:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22edce40: OUTPUT: «Cannot assign to an immutable value␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[18:45] <Zoffix> hm...

[18:45] <TimToady> and it's not like the callsite is gonna be megamorphic

[18:45] * Zoffix decides to leave the boat unrocked and closes the ticket

[18:45] <TimToady> well, it's still LTA

[18:45] * Zoffix renames the ticket instead

[18:46] <TimToady> we wanna be able to optimize the heck out of scalar assignment, fershure

[18:47] <TimToady> but if we've already gotta check for immutability, a further check in the error handling for list-assignability is probably not going to do much more than spread out cache hits from a longer goto

[18:48] <TimToady> and perhaps multiple scalar assignments can share the same checking code out-of-line

[18:49] * TimToady is of course just shooting off his mouth without actually looking at the code :)
