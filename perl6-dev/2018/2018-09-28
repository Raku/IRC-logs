[02:18] <MasterDuke> re changing the profile filename options, what about --profile-stage=<stage> and --profile-compile=<kind>? right now they default to the usual name/output type, but you can change that with --profile-filename

[02:20] <MasterDuke> should we keep --profile-filename around forever for them? or just assume that you would use --profile=<filename> and --profile-(stage|compile) would override it to do the specific kind of profiling?

[11:04] <lizmat> *should it be [Nil,Nil,3]

[11:05] <jnthn> It's correct; the array composer assigns each incoming value into a Scalar container, so you get normal assignment semantics.

[11:18] <lizmat> hmmm... using that makes my opt go from 1.8x faster to 1.5x :-(

[11:21] <lizmat> true

[11:22] <dogbert2> what 1.662 for test-t! another day another record :-)

[11:23] <lizmat> yeah... and that's even before jnthn's escape analysis work

[11:27] <dogbert2> are we running out of 'easy' opts now?

[11:28] <jnthn> Depends how you define "easy", but from the spesh perspective I think most of what goes on there wouldn't fall within most people's definition of "easy". :)

[11:29] <jnthn> But in terms of "are there easy things left that we can do in spesh", the answer is maybe, but I suspect the next rounds of bigger wins will need decidedly non-easy things.

[11:29] <jnthn> PEA being one of them

[11:29] <jnthn> We could also do with loop invariant code motion

[11:30] <dogbert2> so no more 'busted stats'

[11:30] <jnthn> Both of those are especially interesting around loops. However, OSR means we can move into an optimized version of a loop while the loop is running

[11:31] <jnthn> So things hoisted out of the loop can get "interesting".

[11:31] <jnthn> So yeah, there's some headaches ahead there.

[11:31] <jnthn> I'll probably find more things like I have during the last week where we can better tune the things we have or fix shortcomings that lead to missed opportunities

[11:32] <dogbert2> what about the 'two hot loops in a row' thingy 

[11:32] *** M4GNV520 joined
[11:32] <jnthn> I think we can perhaps deal with that by spotting than the OSR point in the second loop as never hit yet and speshing it into an unconditional deopt

[11:33] <jnthn> And then perhaps making OSR specializations be keyed on the OSR point at which we entered them

[11:33] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v M4GNV520

[11:33] <jnthn> Or "additionally keyed"

[11:33] <jnthn> *spotting that, a few messages back

[11:34] <jnthn> So effectively we'd re-specialize it once we have data about the second loop

[11:34] <dogbert2> would it gain much you think?

[11:41] <tbrowder__> hi, folks, i just asked a question about roast contributions on #perl6  but meant to ask it here. basically how should i handle a test generator script?

[11:43] <tbrowder__> i think there is a clever way to get the test harness to use that script but i don’t want to be ad hoc here.

[11:47] <tbrowder__> never mind, i think i see some examples

[12:03] <tbrowder__> ok, ref roast: it looks like samcv does the same kind of thing: i add my test generator to the appropriate dir (S26) as a manually executed file and version controlled. i execute it to generate the test file which is also version controlled. then all is static until something needs to be changed later.

[12:04] <tbrowder__> i will follow that path unless there are objections

[12:44] *** Zoffix joined
[12:44] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[12:44] <Zoffix> nine: does it work "just fine" tho? I recall trying to write a spec for it on Linux during IO grant and it was mostly broken.

[12:45] <nine> Zoffix: have been using it in production for over a year now

[12:47] <Zoffix> And I recall trying to use my notification-based restarter script on Windows without luck too (though I don't remember if it was notifications that were the problem or something else).

[12:47] <Zoffix> Some files are notified twice for a single change, on Linux.

[12:48] <lizmat> Zoffix: that also happens on MacOS, fwiw

[12:48] <nine> Zoffix: some details of what exactly we use: http://niner.name/blog/house_cleaning_with_perl_6/index.html

[12:48] <nine> Anyway it's good that you reminded me of that block post which has been sitting there for half a year now waiting to be published :/

[12:49] <Zoffix> nine: even that tiny code contains an LTAness, from language design standpoint. Why is `.path` from notification is (apparently) a string rather than IO::Path

[12:50] <dogbert2> lizmat: the loop example above came from RT #131805

[12:50] <synopsebot> RT#131805 [open]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131805 [REGRESSION] [PERF] .grep-ing Ints with a code block is now almost twice slower ( .grep({/foo/}) )

[12:50] <nine> Zoffix: very true!

[12:52] <Zoffix> This emits no notifications for me on Linux. Am I using it wrong? `perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.open(:w); sleep 1'`

[12:53] <nine> Can you try watching a directory?

[12:53] <Zoffix> No output from this: perl6 -e 'start react whenever ".".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.spurt: "42"; sleep 2'

[12:54] <lizmat> fwiw, that doesn't do anything on MacOS either

[12:55] <nine> From inotify(7):

[12:55] <nine>        Inotify monitoring is inode-based: when monitoring a file (but not when monitoring the directory containing a file), an event can be generated for activity on any link to the file (in the same or a different directory).

[12:55] <lizmat> Zoffix: you're watching the file

[12:55] <lizmat> but you change the dir with the open

[12:55] <MasterDuke> m: sub f(Int $n) { return $n <= 1 ?? 1 !! f($n - 1) + f($n - 2); }; say f(35)

[12:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 88e6de226: OUTPUT: «14930352␤»

[12:56] <MasterDuke> m: sub f(Int $n) { return $n <= 1 ?? 1 !! f($n - 1) + f($n - 2); }; say f(35); say now - INIT now

[12:56] <Zoffix> With `react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say };` running and in another terminal deleting an existing `foo` genned 3 notifications: FileChanged, FileRenamed, FileRenamed. Creating it again generated no notifications. Deleting again generated no notifications.

[12:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 88e6de226: OUTPUT: «14930352␤10.4532881␤»

[12:56] <lizmat> m: start react whenever ".".IO.watch { .say }; my $a = "zoffix".IO.open(:w); sleep 1   # FileRenamed

[12:57] <lizmat> Zoffix: if you watch the dir, I *do* get nnotifications

[12:57] <MasterDuke> ^^^ i didn't realize return was quite that expensive

[12:57] <Zoffix> lizmat: this gens no notifications even tho I'm modifying file's contents: perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.spurt: rand; sleep 2'

[12:57] <Zoffix> lizmat: this gives me no notifications: perl6 -e 'start react whenever ".".IO.watch { .say }; my $a = "zoffix".IO.open(:w); sleep 1'

[12:57] <Zoffix> Running inside a temp dir /tmp/tmp.h13QT28V4h

[12:57] <lizmat> it does generate a FileRenamed for me on MacOS

[12:58] <nine> Zoffix: since inotify is inode-based, watching a non-existing file cannot generate any events

[12:58] <nine> It doesn't watch the path, it watches a file or directory pointed to by that path. Which one is determined when the watch is set

[12:58] <Zoffix> nine: it exists the second time I run that code, but I still get no notifications

[12:59] <jnthn> Zoffix: Doesn't a *different* (new) file exist, rather than the one that was being watched?

[12:59] <jnthn> (Since it'd have a new inode number)

[12:59] <Zoffix> jnthn: I dunno, does spurt delete the file?

[13:00] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.spurt: rand, :append; sleep 2'

[13:00] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.spurt: rand, :append; sleep 2'

[13:00] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; "foo".IO.spurt: rand, :append; sleep 2'

[13:00] <Zoffix> no output and in append mode.

[13:00] <jnthn> Oh

[13:00] <jnthn> If nothing else, that code is a race condition

[13:01] <Zoffix> I also tried running the spurt in another program (without `start` on react in the first)

[13:01] <lizmat> perhaps sleep a bit *before* spurting I guess  :-)

[13:01] <jnthn> But still, I think you'd need to watch the enclosing directory to see file creations. May be wrong, but that's my recollection of how this works.

[13:02] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'start react whenever "foo".IO.watch { .say }; sleep 1; "foo".IO.spurt: rand, :append; sleep 2'

[13:02] <Zoffix> /tmp/tmp.UoGxvUFDFi/foo: FileChanged

[13:02] <Zoffix> Well, I'll believe it works when I'll see a passing spec :)

[13:03] <lizmat> fwiw, delivery of these notifications seems very dependent on load on the machine

[13:03] <lizmat> so running it inside a spec test is probably the worst place to do it

[13:03] <Zoffix> That was an error; was running spurt in wrong dir: <Zoffix> │ I also tried running the spurt in another program (without `start` on react in the first)

[13:05] <Zoffix> Also, is FileChanged/FileDeleted the only thing we can tell? Like, there's no FileCreated or anything?

[13:05] <Zoffix> Oh, there's like a gazillion events listed in `man inotify`

[13:08] <jnthn> Zoffix: We're exposing what libuv provided at the time this was put in (some years ago), and nobody has worked on it since. I suspect it's maybe exposing a portable subset? When I looked at the area a bit, it all seemed pretty fraught and non-portable.

[13:08] <jnthn> (If anyone has worked on it since, then sorry, I missed that. :))

[13:10] <Zoffix> (for context of that question; last night I reverted some of the IO::Notification spec to not spec that file creation gives FileRenamed, etc event https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/f349244f57416d4da3f3d9c4ec597ed76eb4beca )

[13:10] <jnthn> hah, yes, git log of it shows that the only notable thing that happened since it was added was making it use UTF8-C8 encoding and a bug fix, and the rest was just keeping it up to date with overall MoarVM changes

[13:12] <jnthn> I think http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/fs_event.html#c.uv_fs_event is latest docs and the enum there still only has change and rename

[13:57] <MasterDuke> i thought i remembered something going on with it recently. but i don't remember why it's going away?

[13:58] <lizmat> because we couldn't decide on the exact semantics, I think

[13:59] <MasterDuke> hm, that's too bad. i remember thinking from very early on how nice it was having memoization built in to the language itself

[14:01] <jnthn> I think a substantially overhauled form of it might live on

[14:01] <lizmat> well, then you should fight for getting rid of the "experimental" tag

[14:01] *** zohnex18 joined
[14:02] <jnthn> experimental is right about the current implementation

[15:45] <timotimo> if the capture also had the self in it, i'd totally suggest giving "is cached" an API like "is cached(*.Str)" for the simple case where stringifying the capture is enough

[15:45] <timotimo> but the self would have to be put in there some other way

[15:55] <nine> Now that I've got the structure in place, things become interesting. I need to compile all QAST nodes in order. But for some like QAST::Block we only gather the required information while compiling their children.

[16:00] <nine> So either I introduce an information gathering pass, or I keep the current structure and compile the children first to a temporary bytecode buffer and append it later.

[16:02] <nine> I'm leaning towards the latter for now as it ought to give me working code sooner. The changes are pretty intrusive already...

[16:18] <jnthn> nine: Yeah, the traversal is a lot of late-bound dispatch, so I think one pass probably will win on performance also

[20:26] <patrickb> Should this: `perl6 --output=foo.moarvm --target=mbc foo.p6 && moar --libpath=the-stuff-in-the-perl6-startup-script foo.moarvm` in principle work?

[20:57] <patrickb> I'm still thinking about relocatability. I think there must be some code at run time to determine the rakudo installation folder (and set config<prefix> and config<libdir>). Where should such code go when it's possible to run compiled user code directly? Is there some pre usercode region where stuff can be injected?

[20:57] <timotimo> did people get timings for the fib benchmark? i'd expect we're noticeably worse than for example perl, since deep recursions are definitely not our strong suite.

[20:59] *** damnlie_ joined
[21:00] <lizmat> timotimo: what I've understood is that the base version achieves parity with Perl 5 for  N = 35

[21:00] <lizmat> so I guess it's worse for Perl 5 ?

[21:00] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v damnlie_

[21:00] <timotimo> the "base version"?

[21:02] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aalm11

[21:03] <MasterDuke_> timotimo: Perl6 without return ran fib(45) in about 6s, with return in about 14s, perl 5 did it in about 8s (all on my system)

[21:04] <timotimo> so perl6 is faster than perl5 in this?

[21:05] <lizmat> yes

[21:05] *** damnlie_ left
[21:05] *** aalm11 left
[21:05] <MasterDuke_> whoops, fib(35)

[21:05] <timotimo> but it's surely slower than the other languages in that set?

[21:06] <patrickb> I think I need to read up on how the start up phase of perl6 works... is there some documentation about that? Some hint where to look first in the code?

[21:06] <timotimo> i'd start in nqp's src/HLL/Compiler.nqp

[21:06] *** KenOokamiHoro0 left
[21:06] <timotimo> and also src/vm/moar/HLL/Backend.nqp

[21:07] <timotimo> there's also a Perl6/Compiler.nqp inside rakudo's repository, which derives the HLL::Compiler class

[21:07] *** ggoebel joined
[21:07] <MasterDuke_> timotimo: I haven’t timed it with fib(45) yet. of course I also don’t have an identical system

[21:08] <timotimo> if you'd like a firehose of information on "where to look", you can set MVM_COVERAGE_LOG=/tmp/foo.txt and that will give you every line that has been hit in the order they were hit in - usually a single line will not be reported twice

[21:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ggoebel

[21:09] <MasterDuke_> I think now it does report them multiple times

[21:12] <ggoebel> ...wondering if TimToady has another Programming Perl(6) book left in him? 

[21:12] *** pmurias left
[21:13] <patrickb> timotimo: Thanks! I'll dig in...

[21:14] <timotimo> oh, and there are, or at least used to be, some example compilers in nqp's repository, too
