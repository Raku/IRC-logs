[18:55] <jdv79> my use case at least didn't get markedly slower with the new opts.  just a hair faster.

[18:56] <jdv79> AlexDaniel: can you run that comp bot?

[18:57] <AlexDaniel> hmmmm comp bot?

[18:57] <AlexDaniel> you mean [Tux]? :)

[18:57] <AlexDaniel> http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-09-04#l108

[18:58] <AlexDaniel> so no data points from csv benchmark yet

[18:58] <jdv79> no

[19:00] <AlexDaniel> ok, then what are you trying to do? Pretty sure I have a bot for that, but what exactly are you looking for?

[19:00] <jdv79> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2155#issuecomment-409032994

[19:02] <jdv79> three heads?

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> jdv79: just to run it three times to see how noisy it is

[19:03] <jdv79> seems fairly stable

[19:03] <jdv79> thanks

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> yeah so it's ≈2.74s on HEAD and like ≈2.70 on 2018.06, still worse than it was

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> it's very close though

[19:09] <AlexDaniel> .tell El_Che Not sure what's going on in M#951 but can I have arm arch configured for the canary repo? :)

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> damn

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: status

[19:10] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in ≈10 days and ≈23 hours. 0 blockers. 0 out of 31 commits logged

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> well, whatever it is, I guess with 10 days to the next release we won't need a point release…

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> .tell El_Che and if it's possible, then I guess arm64 won't hurt also?
