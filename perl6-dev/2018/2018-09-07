[14:03] <timotimo> do the tests specify anything?

[14:05] <pmurias> timotimo: I don't think so

[14:05] <pmurias> I could change the js implementation and see if they pass ;)

[14:05] <timotimo> why not :)

[14:05] <pmurias> * still pass

[14:14] <pmurias> timotimo: the tests don't specify anything

[14:15] <pmurias> is #perl6-dev or #perl6 the place for language design questions

[14:18] <timotimo> either should be fine

[14:19] <pmurias> TimToady: what should "a" ~^ "a" return, and also what about "a\0" | "a\0"?

[14:26] <pmurias> timotimo: just skipping trailing null seems to make the most sense logically to me (we just assume both strings are infinite and zero padded when they are of different lengths)

[14:26] <pmurias> timotimo: OTOH I'm not sure what the use of ~&, ~|, ~^ other than it being in place because it was a Perl 5 feature

[15:16] *** dct left
[15:36] <TimToady> pmurias: I don't think the bitops should be required to trim trailing nulls, but are allowed to truncate the result when they know the rest of it would be "\0"

[15:37] <TimToady> which primarily affects ~& so that it is allowed to return a result the size of the shorter argment

[15:38] <TimToady> I note that in p5, "a" ^ "a" returns "\0", not ""

[15:39] <TimToady> and "a\0" | "a\0" returns "a\0"

[15:41] <TimToady> so that's the policy p5 follows, though one could argue that reduction to minimal form should be automatic

[15:42] <TimToady> otoh, often you're dealing with a bunch of bitmaps of the same length, so maybe it's wasted effort, and the user can always strip nulls if they want

[15:44] <TimToady> anyway, this is one of the few areas where my inclination is to torment the user on behalf of the developer :)

[15:51] <TimToady> on the gripping hand, if anyone is seriously using such bitops in p6, they should really be using Buf types rather than Str types
