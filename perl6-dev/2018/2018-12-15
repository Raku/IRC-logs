[13:13] <timotimo> ^- lizmat, "Other array ops treat negative indices as counting from the end of the array.

[13:13] <timotimo> Do the same for the bytestream handling ops.

[13:13] <timotimo> "

[13:13] <lizmat> I guess that answers that question

[13:14] <lizmat> feels to me that is propagating incorrect baheviour

[13:14] <lizmat> the index < 0 handling is *sooo* Perl 5

[13:14] <lizmat> and it causes quite a lot of overhead on the HLL side  :-(

[13:15] <lizmat> slowing down *all* indexed accesses

[13:36] <timotimo> do we actually use those semantics anywhere at all?

[13:36] <timotimo> should i try to add an exception to moarvm's code and run a spectest to see?

[13:40] <timotimo> should be able to fix code as it comes up, though, right?

[13:41] <lizmat> think so...

[13:41] <timotimo> will need a rebootstrap, though

[13:46] <timotimo> OK, looks like we do actually generate access to negative indices in regex code

[13:47] <lizmat> I guess another legacy from the Parrot days :-(

[13:48] <lizmat> timotimo: if you could generate a gist of places where that is happening, I could have a go at it as well
