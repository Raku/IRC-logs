[11:29] <jnthn> .tell lizmat It depends. If you have a type constraint and that type is *not* Iterable then it generates code that strips off the Scalar container and stores it uncontainerized. That means nothing later on has to decont it again. Plus code-gen improved of late to emit just one decont, not multiple, in this case.

[20:48] *** felco8 left
[20:49] <timotimo> check if the second child is an "Ii", i guess

[20:54] <MasterDuke> easy enough. how about if i have ($opname eq '&infix:<+>' || $opname eq '&infix:<->' || $opname eq '&infix:<*>'), any easy way to build the right QAST::Op using the $opname? i.e., i want add_i, sub_i, and mul_i respectively

[20:57] <timotimo> not that i know of. also, don't forget to check if they come from the setting

[20:58] <MasterDuke> yeah, i have that already

[20:58] <timotimo> i mean in theory you could use optimize_op for that i guess? that might constant-fold it for you

[20:58] <MasterDuke> guess i'll just build a little hash

[21:36] <timotimo> hm, i think so?

[21:36] <timotimo> does the current optimization stop outside of big int range?

[21:37] <MasterDuke> it doesn't look like there are any checks

[21:37] <timotimo> perhaps you can make your new code work completely before the other code does anything

[21:38] <timotimo> also, if you're in bigint territory, you can't create an QAST::IVal from it

[23:54] <timotimo> lizmat: does that happen reliably?

[23:54] <lizmat> 100%

[23:55] *** shreyansh_k11 left
[23:55] <timotimo> can you use that mac os equivalent of strace on that?

[23:55] <timotimo> is it dtrace?

[23:55] <timotimo> ok, dtruss seems to give you what you need, but it might have bo se set suid root to work?

[23:57] <lizmat> dtrace: failed to execute perl6: dtrace cannot control executables signed with restricted entitlements

[23:58] <timotimo> uhh?

[23:58] <timotimo> perhaps you have to cat (which perl6) and put dtruss in front of the commandline there?

[23:59] <lizmat> this is quickly becoming too complicated for me at this late hour on a whiskey tasting filled day
