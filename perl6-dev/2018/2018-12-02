[00:15] <timotimo> lucasb: i'd assume the implementation does that because in the first one, setup of the second lines iterator happens after the first one has been exhausted, but in the second one it sets up two iterators before asking for any elements; something in that vicinity must be doing weird stuff.

[11:49] <lucasb> m: say 1, 2 Z~ 3, 4

[11:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´(13 24)‚ê§¬ª

[11:49] <lucasb> m: say 1, 2 Z, 3, 4

[11:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´((1 3) (2 4))‚ê§¬ª

[11:50] <lucasb> ^^ cool, I can "parameterize" the Z metaop with "~", ",", etc... to get the behavior I want, right?

[11:50] <lucasb> m: say ('foo' x 3, 'foo' xx 3)

[11:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´(foofoofoo (foo foo foo))‚ê§¬ª

[11:51] <lucasb> would you agree if I said that the "x" and "xx" operators looks like a imaginary REPEAT metaop, specialized with string concatenation "~" and list creation "," ?

[11:53] <lucasb> except that "x" and "xx" are not similar, since "xx" is thunky and "x" isn't

[11:54] <lucasb> so in "rand x 3" you get the same number concatenated 3 times

[11:54] <lucasb> while in "rand xx 3" you get a list of 3 different numbers

[11:58] <lucasb> so P5 has this thunky behavior in block-less map/grep, right?

[11:58] <lucasb> "map $_, LIST" and "map $x, LIST", despite being very similar, do very different things

[11:59] <lucasb> I believe this was fixed in P6 by always requiring a block? like in "map {$_}, LIST"

[12:07] <lucasb> I agree that "rand xx 3" would be less useful is it wasn't thunky. But I also can understand if someone argues that "xx" breaks the expectation that "simple operators" will only evaluate their operands once

[12:07] <lucasb> *...less useful if it wasn't thunky.

[12:07] <timotimo> well, it does syntactically not require a block

[12:07] <timotimo> you can put a sub or variable there, or you can use a whatever-star curried piece of code

[12:08] <lucasb> ah, right. I didn't mean syntactically about "map". I think it expects a Code/Callable there..., right?

[12:08] <timotimo> m: (1, 2, 3).map(9).perl.say

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot resolve caller map(List: Int); none of these signatures match:‚ê§    ($: Hash \h, *%_)‚ê§    (\SELF: &block;; :$label, :$item, *%_)‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[12:09] <timotimo> oh?

[12:09] <timotimo> m: (1, 2, 3).map({1 => "hi", 2 => "goodbye", 3 => "cat"}).perl.say

[12:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot map a List to a Hash.‚ê§Did you mean to add a stub ({...}) or did you mean to .classify?‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[12:09] <timotimo> ah

[12:09] <timotimo> that's for when you accidentally mis-spell code as a hash instead

[12:09] <timotimo> so you get a better error message

[12:12] <lucasb> timotimo: BTW, thanks commenting about (lines, lines). Actual bug, right? Deserves an issue?

[12:12] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dogbert17

[12:12] <timotimo> the error should definitely be different

[12:13] <timotimo> not entirely sure what the correct behaviour should be

[12:13] <lucasb> why would that be an error?

[12:13] <lucasb> reading a second time should return a empty list

[12:13] <lucasb> at least, it was my expectation

[12:13] <timotimo> er

[12:13] <timotimo> i meant to say

[12:13] <timotimo> that error is definitely wrong

[12:13] <lucasb> ah, ok :-)
