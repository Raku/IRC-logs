[08:07] <ufobat> thank you :-) nice to had breakfast together once :-)

[08:07] <ufobat> oh btw, steffen made me to start with I18N::LangTags for p6, because he is about to port this Text::LocalDomain::OO thingy to p6

[08:07] <lizmat> whee!   :-)

[08:10] <samcv> lizmat: nice link

[08:38] <lizmat> hmmm... looking at some Cool / Str interactions (e.g. .indices / .split) I wonder what the remaining functionality of .Stringy is

[08:38] <lizmat> looks to me either .indices should also use .Stringy or .split should also use .Str

[08:41] <lizmat> afk&

[09:49] <timotimo> is "programming language perl" also counted by tiobe, or is it only "perl programming language"?

[09:54] <timotimo> looks like tiobe uses "perl programming" in quotes on different search engines

[09:54] <timotimo> actually, maybe they don't have it in quotes

[23:12] <samcv> looks like version skew issue..

[23:18] <timotimo> maybe i'll push a disablement patch until i can fix it for real

[23:19] <timotimo> (if it's the one caused by the spesh worker)

[23:20] <samcv> i think i'm almost done getting MVM compiling on solaris properly. lots of work

[23:20] <samcv> at least frustrating

[23:20] <samcv> had to patch libtommath since it didn't like "goto ERR" so i had to change all ERR's to ERR_

[23:21] <timotimo> let's see if it even compiles ...

[23:23] <samcv> timotimo: your fix? or what i'm talking about?

[23:23] <timotimo> my fix

[23:26] <timotimo> seems unexplosive

[23:29] <samcv> timotimo: maybe i shouldn't name it ERR_. it's only leading _ that's reserved right?

[23:30] <samcv> so shouldn't be an issue? about to make a PR to libtommath so they get the fix too

[23:30] <timotimo> TOM_ERR? :)

[23:31] <samcv> hah

[23:32] <samcv> and then it was annoying i had issues with dyncall since solaris is nice and fun and puts an #error in there if you try and -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 on a 32 bit system

[23:32] <samcv> since it includes a system header

[23:32] <samcv> would have been nicer if it had been a warning and just ignored it. though idk maybe it breaks compilation totally.

[23:49] <timotimo> i'm worried the change i made might cause frames to abort over and over in spesh and being retried without the cause of the abort being addressed

[23:50] <timotimo> i won't be able to check that before i sleep
