[12:18] <tbrowder__> when processing a pod chunk during testing i see a contents of pod instance N looking like the contents of a previous pod instance of N-2. it may have something to do with block type but i’ve not seen this before. my immediate concern is how “make” in Actions.nqp affects the compile%

[12:21] *** Ven`` joined
[12:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven``

[12:23] <tbrowder__> for instance, does, say, $<pod_contents> get overwritten by next use or does it hang around in an array or hash on $/ as the cursor moves on?

[12:25] <tbrowder__> i’m expecting every $/ passed to an actions method to be in its own scope but maybe that’s not quite true (although lots of .dumps seem to confirm that)

[12:39] <pmurias> Zoffix: sometimes the sheer amount of bugs being found in rakudo makes me wonder if Perl 6 being so large is really a good idea :/

[12:39] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: how do you count? Reportable disagrees: https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/2c1d0dbb2955715584d83483c1090dce

[12:40] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: you don't need to wait for the release to merge it

[12:40] <AlexDaniel> dogbert17: rakudo and nqp are released from branches, so whatever happens on master after the branch is created no longer matters

[12:40] <AlexDaniel> that was true for the last few releases actually

[12:41] <AlexDaniel> note, however, that this is not the current practice in MoarVM

[12:41] <AlexDaniel> so you do need to wait for moarvm release, but that already happened

[12:42] <nine> pmurias: Perl 6 contains a lot that you would find in libaries elsewhere. I see no indication that those libaries contain significantly fewer bugs. Also our goals are set quite high. How often do you see LTA error messages reported as bugs in libaries that provide things we have in core?

[12:42] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I went with ^ that total + rakudo issues

[12:43] <Zoffix> pmurias: all the bugs are because people don't write tests

[12:46] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I can feel your pain :)

[12:47] <Zoffix> Well, it's not just my pain. We're all wasting valueable resources chasing bugs that didn't have to exist and trying to do research to document features that should've been documented in the first place.

[12:48] <Zoffix> Like R#2303

[12:48] <lizmat> Zoffix: I think one of the issues is that writing tests codifies a Perl 6 version

[12:48] <synopsebot> R#2303 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2303 [@LARRY] Are `NumericEnumeration` / `StringyEnumeration` implementation detail?

[12:48] <lizmat> and I most definitely have held of writing tests because of that

[12:49] <lizmat> *back

[12:50] <Zoffix> lizmat: I don't see why it's the issue; or at least, I don't see why it's acceptable to implement a feature the users will likely use, but not acceptable to also spec the behaviour. It's like: what's the plan there? That the feature will change in the future or someone else will just write a partial-test because they're not fully aware of how the feature was designed or what?

[12:50] <Zoffix> lizmat: your QuantHash ops test are wonderful.

[12:50] <Zoffix> That will be part of the spec.

[12:50] * Zoffix & to get laundry

[12:51] <lizmat> well, what happened is that it was unsure if the feature I implemented was going to stay

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix++ for pointing out important issues

[12:51] <lizmat> and then it stayed, and I didn't write tests

[12:51] <lizmat> :-(

[12:52] <lizmat> I guess I should make issues for those things in the future, so test writing doesn't fall through the cracks

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> yes, good point

[12:53] <AlexDaniel> the number of testneeded tickets does not seem to be growing at a crazy rate, which is good

[12:55] <AlexDaniel> and the ones that keep piling up are generally related to stability and other things that are hard to test

[12:59] *** Guest19583 joined
[13:00] <Zoffix> lizmat: IMO if there's enough sureness to implement a feature (as opposed to, say, maintain a discussion about it), then it's more likely it'll stay than be removed. It might change slightly, but the tests speccing it can also change until the spec is actually released.

[13:01] <lizmat> otoh, not having tests makes it easier to remove things later, like the awaiterator recently :-)
