[00:00] <timotimo> we're not testing. this is serious.

[00:06] <timotimo> i didn't time how much exactly it took while i was profiling, but it's spending like 4 seconds in GC

[00:07] <timotimo> i see it taking a whole load of closures

[00:11] <timotimo> if zef didn't use "exit", the profiler might not get quite as confused

[00:24] <timotimo> the main moar process calls stat 1163 times, fun.

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: that doesn't sound like much?

[00:29] <timotimo> looks like every file gets statted four times, at least the ones under share/perl6/site/dist/

[00:30] <timotimo> it also stats a whole bunch of precomp files

[00:30] <AlexDaniel> isn't it normal?

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> I mean if you run something like zef --help, wouldn't it stat a bunch of stuff also?

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> just to see if zef and all of its modules are precompiled right and stuff like that

[00:33] <timotimo> i don't actually know enough about that

[00:33] <AlexDaniel> but anyway, why calling stat 1000 times is a problem?

[00:34] <AlexDaniel> I expect any 1000 of filesystem operations to take absolutely no time

[00:34] <timotimo> yeah, just like 2 seconds, so it's not our culprit at least

[00:34] <AlexDaniel> and by no time I mean in context of 10 seconds that I see

[00:34] <timotimo> er, 8 seconds?

[00:35] <timotimo> no, those must be msecs

[00:35] <timotimo> . is not thousands separator %)

[00:38] <timotimo> i'd really like to know who calls exit there

[00:39] <samcv> [Tux]: when you're around pm me about utf16 stuff

[00:40] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/c07448cd20b61bc9809fed12fb2a8728679bbb32/lib/Zef/CLI.pm6#L183

[00:41] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: you can comment it out

[00:41] <timotimo> TYVM

[00:44] <AlexDaniel> hm, interesting

[00:44] <AlexDaniel> so returning something from MAIN doesn't use that return value as exit code

[00:45] <timotimo> grr, it's still calling exit somehow

[00:45] <timotimo> ah, abort also exits

[00:45] <AlexDaniel> so you have to use `exit` to abruptly end your program just so that you can have the exit code that you need

[00:46] <timotimo> IMO, it shouldn't exit with what you return

[00:46] <timotimo> it should exit 0 if it exits fine and something else if you throw

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> throw what?

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> I want to exit with exit code 5, how?

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> without throwing LEAVE and other cleanup into a dumpster

[00:47] <timotimo> that's when you'd exit 5

[00:47] <AlexDaniel> well that sucks

[00:47] <timotimo> hmm.

[00:47] <timotimo> ISTR some way to give an exception an exit code along with it

[00:48] <timotimo> was that a thing?

[00:48] <timotimo> you can teach exit what to do

[00:48] <timotimo> m: sub test { LEAVE say "exited test"; blorp }; sub blorp { LEAVE say "exited blorp"; exit 5 };  test

[00:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar b1a07f093: ( no output )

[00:48] <timotimo> mhm

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> I mean, someone will probably argue that the solution to this is to have no LEAVE blocks in your MAIN

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> and instead have them somewhere else

[00:49] <timotimo> something is *still* calling exit

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> m: sub real-MAIN-right-here { LEAVE say ‘foo’; 2 + 2 }; sub MAIN { real-MAIN-right-here; exit 5 }

[00:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar b1a07f093: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[00:51] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: are you sure you're using the modified file?

[00:52] <timotimo> i have sensible timings!!

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> \o/

[00:53] <MasterDuke> timotimo: heh, couldn't you use your profiler output to tell you where exit was being called from?

[00:54] <timotimo> i was

[00:54] <timotimo> i see 4 seconds of json parsing

[00:54] <timotimo> if i see it correctly, parsing 150 json documents

[00:54] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: using what? JSON::Fast?

[00:55] <timotimo> no, rakudo's built-in one

[00:55] <timotimo> 700ms of Zef::Identity parsing

[00:55] <AlexDaniel> hm, what are these 150 json files…

[00:56] <AlexDaniel> if it was 1000 I'd understand

[00:57] <timotimo> debugserver should be able to show me

[00:57] <timotimo> but i'd probably like to go to bed now

[00:57] <timotimo> do you want my sql file to look at it with the profiler frontend?

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> I'm going to bed now too

[10:59] <nine> Ah, I guess that's @MAST::Ops::values

[11:02] <nine> And I guess @MAST::Ops::offsets tells me where in that value list an op's arguments start

[11:04] <lizmat> hmmm... do we have a simple way to tell if something is a container ?

[11:04] <lizmat> *without* using NQP ?

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: any news?

[11:05] <lizmat> if not, how about adding a Mu::CONTAINER(\a) { nqp::hllbool(nqp::iscont(a)) } ?

[11:05] <lizmat> or rather:

[11:05] <lizmat> if not, how about adding a Mu.CONTAINER(\SELF:) { nqp::hllbool(nqp::iscont(SELF)) } ?

[11:07] <AlexDaniel> TL;DR `time zef --dry --/test --/build install JSON::Fast` takes 10 seconds or maybe a bit less depending on the system

[11:08] <nine> AlexDaniel: no, missed that apparently

[11:11] <nine> 150 JSON files?

[11:11] <AlexDaniel> well, at least 150 calls to from-json I guess

[11:12] <AlexDaniel> that's as far as we managed to get yesterday, I thought maybe you know something :)

[11:12] <nine> Well I was pretty sure that almost all of that waiting time is JSON parsing

[11:13] <AlexDaniel> nine: ok, but what kind of json files?

[11:14] <nine> Personally, I'd probably just store that ecosystem info in an SQLite file. But 150 calls sounds more like it's parsing JSON of installed dists, too

[11:25] <lizmat> yeah, afaik it's only there for backward compatibility

[11:25] <lizmat> afk&

[11:25] <AlexDaniel> makes me wonder if zef can use JSON::Fast if it's available, and fallback to Rakudo::Internals::JSON

[11:25] <AlexDaniel> I do understand that the two are possibly incompatible, but still…

[11:26] <timotimo> how fast do we figure out if something is installed or not?

[11:26] <timotimo> i.e. how much does it cost to check for JSON::Fast if it isn't there?

[11:27] <AlexDaniel> IIRC relatively fast

[11:27] <timotimo> also, maybe there's a cheap 2x improvement somewhere inside rakudo's json parser

[11:27] <timotimo> for example, a fast path for strings that have no escapes in them

[11:28] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ah actually, you don't need zef to check that

[11:28] <nine> I sure hope it's pretty damn fast afte all the time I spent optimizing our module loader :)

[11:30] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: any reason to hunt for 2x improvements when we can make it more than 6x as fast using JSON::Fast? :)

[11:30] <AlexDaniel> that will only affect the initial zef install when JSON::Fast is not available

[11:30] <timotimo> hmm.

[11:31] <AlexDaniel> once the user installs pretty much… any module… then it's guaranteed they'll have JSON::Fast :)

[11:31] <timotimo> i suppose being one of the most depended-on modules, it's not so bad to support it in zef, too, yeah

[11:36] <timotimo> and access it at run time? :)

[12:26] <tbrowder__> AlexDaniel: in web editor it looked ok, after editing, in.

[12:26] <AlexDaniel> the web editor sucks then

[12:27] <tbrowder__> in my chrome browser on ipad the “my” is hanging out one char to the left

[12:27] <AlexDaniel> the problem is tabs

[12:28] <tbrowder__> yeah, probably, but in orig source or githubs display of it?

[12:28] <AlexDaniel> https://screenshots.firefox.com/SbtlAZIWuM2DTLxx/null

[12:29] <tbrowder__> weird

[12:29] <AlexDaniel> IMO we shouldn't use tabs in the source code

[12:30] <tbrowder__> i agree, i thought xt did something about that

[12:31] <tbrowder__> afaik, my emacs fix earlier this year stopped tabs from my code

[12:31] <tbrowder__> i’ll try to remember to not edit code with web editor, sorry

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder__: tabs existed before your change

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> it seems like you added some spaces to make it align in the view of the web editor, and the right solution was to remove tabs first and then do that :)

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> that will mangle the original %*ENV, right?
