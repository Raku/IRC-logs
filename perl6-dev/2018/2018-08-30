[10:58] <pmurias> jnthn: any significant reasons why the jvm backend keeps the REPR and REPRData as separate objects?

[10:58] <yoleaux> 28 Aug 2018 22:56Z <AlexDaniel> pmurias: this test does not pass on jvm https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/f0f3843e62dcd7b087bce5b694c3b528755fa1f6

[10:58] <timotimo> pmurias: probably just taken over from moarvm; REPR_data is variable-sized, that's why it's behind a pointer in moarvm

[10:59] <pmurias> wasn't the JVM backend done before MoarVM?

[10:59] <timotimo> er

[10:59] <pmurias> (it could be taken from Parrot)

[10:59] <timotimo> parrot probably also had REPR_data :)

[11:00] <jnthn> The initial 6model implementation was in C; various things were adapted for the JVM, but where it wasn't deemed performance sensitive I stuck with keeping things similar.

[11:01] <jnthn> But in C, a REPR is a static thing, whereas REPR data is per type, subject to GC, etc.

[11:01] <timotimo> oh, oops, of course

[11:01] <jnthn> And yes, that C was a Parrot extension :)

[11:01] <timotimo> well, shows that i still need to finish waking up

[11:02] <jnthn> Though the design of the C code survived largely intact in MoarVM
