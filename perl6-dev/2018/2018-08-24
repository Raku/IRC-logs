[14:11] <nine> Oh boy. explicitly-manage has always been broken but in a different way: all strings marked by that function would always report the encoding that was passed to the function last

[14:11] <nine> ye olde class definitions are not closures issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/lib/NativeCall.pm6#L635

[14:12] <jnthn> oops

[14:14] <[Coke]> good find

[14:14] <jnthn> nine++

[14:15] <nine> I wonder if there is a better way to implement explicitly-manage that won't involve having to check each and every string passed to a native sub for a .cstr method.

[14:17] <jnthn> Surely there is

[14:17] <nine> Shouldn't the "who's in charge of freeing this string" depend more on the native sub than the string itself? If the sub (or code it passes the string to) will free the string, we need to handle it specially. If not, then not.

[14:18] *** Kaiepi joined
[14:18] <nine> Thus the information should be part of the sub's definition. I.e. it should require a CStr instead of a Str.

[14:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaiepi

[14:20] *** pharv_ left
[14:28] <nine> The whole thing makes even less sense the more I think about it. explicitly-manage mixes in a role that adds an attribute with a copy of the string in CStr representation. NativeCall will encode the string in the target encoding and only if the string's repr is not CStr free the encoded string afterwards. So why copy the string in the first place? The copy will be GCed just like the original in any case.

[14:31] <jnthn> I think the idea was to pass in a string that would become owned by the callee

[14:31] <jnthn> Rather than freeing it after the call

[14:32] <jnthn> No argument that it's a good solution :P

[14:34] *** skids joined
[14:35] <nine> But whether the string would become owned by the callee is a static property of the callee, i.e. whether it contains some call to free() or not. It doesn't depend on the individual string.

[14:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v skids

[14:35] <jnthn> Yes, I agree.

[14:40] <nine> Luckily there's already quite some machinery implemented for tracking whether a string argument is supposed to be free'd after the call. Which is used to tell the VM that arguments ought to be free'd while returned strings are not.

[14:42] <nine> This is just waiting for an explicitly-managed trait on the argument :)

[14:49] <nine> What I absolutely don't understand is why removing that call to explicitly-manage in Audio-Sndfile fixes the segfault. As the compiled native call code doesn't handle the trait it shouldn't change anything.

[20:50] <timotimo> samcv: could it be caused by the recent switch-around of roles in the repos? or was that just in perl6/ ?

[20:50] <samcv> timotimo: that's what i'm guessing? dunno who to ask to get it fixed

[20:51] <timotimo> i don't seem to have access for that

[21:04] *** skids left
[21:29] <AlexDani`> samcv: you should have now

[21:29] *** AlexDani` is now known as AlexDaniel

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I locked master so that people push somewhere else :)

[21:30] <samcv> ah i can do that from now on

[21:30] <samcv> if that's what the new thing is I will do it

[21:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Don't store owner or group in our release's tar archive

[21:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: 

[21:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: Set owner and group to ID 0 and don't store the same either. This is

[21:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: done so the archive will not show the username of the user who created

[21:44] <Geth> ¦ rakudo: the release.

[21:51] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: In the future, I think we should have a release branch rather than blocking master. (It's what I plan to have us switch to doing in MoarVM.)

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: sure, I can do that. In fact I've done that for the last two releases, I think?

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> for me it makes no difference from which branch I release

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: in fact, why future

[21:54] <jnthn> Didn't want to disrupt what you're doing ;)

[21:54] * AlexDaniel unlocks master

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: branches are cheap

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> cool, there're now https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/tree/release-2018.08 https://github.com/perl6/nqp/tree/release-2018.08

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> moarvm side you guys handle yourself please :)

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: fwiw it doesn't resolve the problem fully. Say we're a few days before the release and someone decides to push breaking stuff into master. Do we expect the release branch to exist at that point already? If yes, then all good and needed fixes to master will need to be cherrypicked, so that's a lot of cherrypicking… and if we don't want that, then we're still blocking master, just in a different (less strong) way

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> I guess something like that is what git flow is attempting to fix, but it has its own issues

[22:03] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Yeah, there's no perfect option. Probably about the right point to do it is when toaster looks clean enough that "we must be very close" :)

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> cool, we'll try it out next time

[22:04] <jnthn> I'm also wondering what it'd take to get more regular toaster runs

[22:05] <jnthn> So far as I can tell, automation + somebody providing a place to run it

[22:06] *** Ven`` joined
[22:06] <AlexDaniel> basically a rewrite of toaster, see http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-08-12#l652

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> like, of some parts of it at least

[22:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven``

[22:06] <jnthn> Ah, that'd be a way to make it run in less time, yes

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> basically the way it works now is very wasteful, if I understand correctly it will install most modules more than once (sometimes as a dependency)

[22:06] <jnthn> Though how long does a run take with it today?

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> about an hour on the machine I was using

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> but that's google cloud thingy with a bunch of cores

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> or maybe ≈2 hours, I don't remember

[22:08] <AlexDaniel> but personally I also want it to bisect right away so that I'm not spending any time on that

[22:08] <jnthn> Hm, like a 32-core one?

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> yeah mine has 24 cores

[22:09] <AlexDaniel> if it can already run tests there's no good reason for it not to run the same tests with a different rakudo, bisecting is also cheap :)

[22:09] <timotimo> have we considered mounting a filesystem that can do snapshots and doing some magic with that for the installation stuff? or maybe trickery with hard links?

[22:10] *** Ven`` left
[22:11] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: no, why? Like, what is this going to help with?

[22:11] <timotimo> i should perhaps have read that irclog :D

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> and now that I figured out that zef has --to thingy, it looks even easier

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> also it sounds like fun project to work on if you have time, so if anybody is looking for a way to contribute ;) ;) ;)

[22:17] <jnthn> I'd guess one could just topo-sort the whole ecosystem, and then install/test that way?

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: yes

[22:17] <jnthn> It's fun but I'm not exactly short of things to do :P

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> yeah that's exactly what I mean

[22:18] <AlexDaniel> I wish we had something like GSoC or similar

[22:18] <jnthn> Indeed
