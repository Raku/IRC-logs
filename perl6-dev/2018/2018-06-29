[08:12] <lizmat> hmmm...  do we have an easy way to create a sub that will take a thunk (rather than an explicit Callable)?

[08:13] <lizmat> so you could write:  foo DBIish.connect(...)   instead of having to add curlies:   foo { DBIish.connect( ... ) }

[08:14] <lizmat> if not, maybe some parameter trait could do it:

[12:15] <notable6> lizmat, Noted!

[12:16] <lizmat> jnthn: are you saying that trampoline { } does that for you now?  Or am I missing something?

[12:17] *** brrt joined
[12:17] *** ExtraCrispy left
[12:20] *** ExtraCrispy joined
[12:23] <jnthn> lizmat: Yes, I'm saying that writing the { ... } on the caller side isn't really so big of a hardship :)

[12:24] <lizmat> so maybe I should call it "defer" and put it in as a real Perl 6 module, rather than a port ?>

[12:26] <jnthn> Well, could also do that, though it's not identical functionality

[12:27] <jnthn> It seems Object::Trampoline lets you store up method calls that should be run later

[12:27] <jnthn> Which is maybe useful for something also :)

[12:27] <jnthn> So it's more a "in addition to" rather than "instead of"

[12:27] <lizmat> well, it lets you create an ersatz object that will become real as soon as you call any method on it

[12:28] <lizmat> it will only take *one* method call to make it real

[12:28] <jnthn> ah, right

[12:29] <lizmat> but you can stack them in the sense that the code of an ersatz object can contain another ersatz object

[12:29] <lizmat> my $dbh = trampoline { DBIish.connect: ... }

[12:29] <lizmat> my $sth = trampoline { $dbh.prepare: 'select foo from bar' }

[12:29] <lizmat> so as soon as you call $sth.execute, it will both realize $dbh and $sth into their intended state

[12:31] <lizmat> my $awaitable = trampoline { start { work } }   # shouldn't that do what you mean ?

[12:32] <lizmat> so basically "defer" would be "trampoline start { } ?

[12:32] <timotimo> but await won't know that this trampoline should be treated as an awaitable

[12:32] <timotimo> i.e. it won't know what to do when you await it

[12:33] <lizmat> when you await something, it calls a method on the Awaitable, does it not ?>

[12:33] <timotimo> m: say await 1

[12:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 587cd4f9e: OUTPUT: «Must specify a Promise, Channel, or Supply to await on (got a Int)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:33] <timotimo> m: say await 1 but Awaitable

[12:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 587cd4f9e: OUTPUT: «Method 'get-await-handle' must be implemented by Int+{Awaitable} because it is required by roles: Awaitable.␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:33] <lizmat> so there

[12:33] <lizmat> I think that should work, lemme see

[12:33] <jnthn> lizmat: There's no way to implement it with 6.c await

[12:34] <jnthn> But the point is that it would *not* return a Promise, but rather something else that is Awaitable

[12:34] <jnthn> But yes, you'd then make `get-await-handle` do the interesting thing :)

[12:34] <lizmat> *any* method call will do the right thing, so I think it should work

[12:35] <jnthn> huh?

[12:35] * jnthn is confused :)

[12:36] <timotimo> but await won't do a method call on the trampoline object

[12:36] <timotimo> it'll just complain that it's not a promise, channel, or supply

[12:36] <jnthn> timotimo: In 6.c, yes :)

[12:36] <lizmat> yeah, unfortunately

[12:36] <timotimo> or does the typecheck cause it to become the thing?

[12:36] <jnthn> Ah, I think that's what you're explaining

[12:36] <jnthn> I'm not sure if `defer` is even a really good name for it :)

[12:37] <lizmat> well, that's why I kept the "trampoline" nomer for now

[13:23] <jnthn> No, I'm saying that the `await` candidates that deal with Awaitable are in the 6.d setting

[13:24] <jnthn> We may get away with it, but I was intentionally keeping only Promise/Supply/Channel as things you can `await` in 6.c to make sure we preserved behavior there

[13:24] <lizmat> ah, ok

[13:25] <lizmat> judging by the spectest we do

[13:25] <lizmat> want me to revert or not?

[13:25] <jnthn> I just had the generalization of `await` to `Awaitable` down as "6.d behavior"

[13:25] <jnthn> I'm sure I had a good reason for that, but I forget what it is now :(

[13:26] <lizmat> I'll revert just in case, it was only because of DRY that I did that

[15:32] * lizmat makes a mental note

[15:32] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: I like it because I'm often confused by stuff like 2x faster in commit messages (which then end up in the changelog, because I'm not redoing the measurements)

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> and usually the changelog for a release has a variety of these

[15:33] <lizmat> yup

[15:33] <lizmat> so, if I said 10% faster, I meant 1.1x faster

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> newspeed ÷ oldspeed, and then “5.5x as fast” – this is very clean and understandable, I think

[15:33] <lizmat> that's how I always did it

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> 1.1x faster or 1.1x as fast?

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> :)

[15:34] <lizmat> what's the difference ?

[15:34] *** b2gills left
[15:34] <AlexDaniel> “ “two times faster” refers to the increase in speed and means that the speed ratio is 3:1, while “two times as fast” means that the speed ratio is 2:1 ”

[15:36] <AlexDaniel> “two times faster” is probably interpreted differently by different people

[15:36] <lizmat> yeah, it was identity for me before just now

[15:36] <lizmat> ok, I meant 10% faster is 1.1x as fast

[15:36] <AlexDaniel> \o/

[15:37] <lizmat> BTW, my calculation is always (newspeed - overhead) / (oldspeed - overhead)

[15:37] <jnthn> I also quite like "runs in 60% of the time it used to", which is also clear

[15:58] <AlexDaniel> actually, now I'm confused

[15:58] <AlexDaniel> in our case less time is better…

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> so it should be oldspeed ÷ newspeed, no?…

[15:59] <AlexDaniel> yes

[20:38] <tbrowder_> instructions say to enter 6d proposals as roast issues. i was hoping for someone to look at my new roast issue GH #441.

[20:40] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: yeah, deprecating sounds good. If there's a way to emit a warning if the language is 6.d, then that'd be great, and it can be removed in 6.e

[20:41] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: the decision on whether to emit a warning would be done during compile time, right? Right when you're parsing the Pod table? Then you can just use $*W.lang-ver-before('d') as a conditional to decide whether to emit the warning. Like in here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L5020-L5022

[20:42] <Zoffix> (that code changes behaviour based on language, not emits a warning, but it does use that conditional)

[20:44] <tbrowder_> ok, so how should i proceed, work on a pr for 6.d using your suggestions or?

[20:50] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: the change doesn't sound all that controvercial and all you're doing right now is making 6.d lang emit a warning. I'd just go ahead and commit directly.

[22:20] <lizmat> hmmm... making Pair Iterable makes the installation process hang

[22:21] <jnthn> I'm not surprised

[22:23] <lizmat> so I figured the basic issue with roundtrippability of Set/Bag/Mix wrt to Pairs, is that the .perl of a Set does not distinguish between a Pair as a key, with a value, and any other key and a value

[22:26] <lizmat> grrr

[22:27] <lizmat> note that the .perl output of both is the same, but the number of "elements" is different

[22:27] *** perlpilot joined
[22:27] <lizmat> well, the .perl is not the same, but when EVALled, it will be the same

[22:31] <lizmat> m: dd ($(:a(42))).Bag  # even if I itemize the Pair, it doesn't work like it should

[22:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0721bfa75: OUTPUT: «("a"=>42).Bag␤»

[22:32] <lizmat> and that's because Pair doesn't have its own .item method

[22:33] <lizmat> adding Pair.item and adapting Pair.perl so that it checks for itemness, breaks several spectests :-(

[22:34] <jnthn> Hmm

[22:34] <jnthn> That's still less drastic than breaking the whole build ;)

[22:34] <lizmat> yeah, and I think it's more correct

[22:34] <jnthn> But yeah, we'd have to take a look at what the spectests are

[22:34] <lizmat> you could also argue, come to think of it

[22:35] <lizmat> that the .perl of Bag is too smart

[22:35] <lizmat> but no, because the same problem exists for Set

[22:36] <lizmat> m: dd Set.new(:a(42)=>0); dd Set.new(:a(42)=>0).perl.EVAL

[22:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0721bfa75: OUTPUT: «((:a(42)) => 0).Set␤().Set␤»
