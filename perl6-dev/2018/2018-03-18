[11:20] <lizmat> Files=1236, Tests=76274, 315 wallclock secs (14.79 usr  5.31 sys + 2166.09 cusr 215.97 csys = 2402.16 CPU)

[11:57] <tyil> with https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/233#issuecomment-373969352 in mind, would it be possible to implement semver?

[11:58] <tyil> versions right now apparently don't support it, and it seems like there's no interest to put it in zef, which would be a shame

[13:01] <nine> tyil: I think there's a bit of a misunderstanding here. I'm quite sure ugexe++ is interested in having semver in zef. I also know that he cares for it to be useful which in his eyes it would only be if rakudo behaved in a similar way.

[13:02] <tyil> his first reply surely doesn't come over that way

[13:03] <tyil> disregarding any benefit of supporting it with the notion it only works if every package uses it

[13:05] <nine> tyil: there's no dismissal in general in his answer. He didn't write "doesn't make sense" but wrote "only makes sense" instead - he gave what he sees as the preconditions that have to be met for semver to actually become useful in the Perl 6 world.

[13:06] <tyil> I'm not well versed in the internals of Perl 6, but would it be possible to implement some syntax in the Perl 6 Version object that allows one to use it in the way I describe

[13:06] <tyil> yes, and that precondition is very incorrect

[13:07] <tyil> there's no need to force everyone to semver at all, nor do I even imply that anywhere

[13:07] <tyil> it's a baseless assumption that this is required for it to work

[13:07] <nine> I'd call it debatable :) The requirement for every package to use it may be over the top. Where I'm firmly of the same opinion is that zef and rakudo should treat versions as the same. Otherwise you'd only ever be able to solve half of the problem and not gain anything.

[13:08] <tyil> which is why I ask if its doable to implement this in perl 6 version objects

[13:08] <tyil> it's the only point he makes which is valid

[13:08] <nine> Taking a step back and looking at the larger picture, you can have what you want without any changes to zef or rakudo at all.

[13:09] <tyil> but as I said, I'm not versed in the Perl 6 internals, so I don't know if it can e doable

[13:09] <tyil> I've asked about how to do what I want plenty of times before, yet never gotten an answer

[13:09] <tyil> it just went by, ignored

[13:10] <tyil> if you have the solution, do tell me

[13:10] <nine> There's a difference between ignoring something and simply not having any idea or anything else to contribute. I'm quite sure the latter was usually the case.

[13:11] <nine> What you want is increasing versions in general being treated as improvements but still being able to make a cut in compatibility. Semver's idea is to encode this as convention in the version itself. But in Perl 6 there's another thing that can solve the problem: :api

[13:13] <tyil> this sounds like a workaround, but please go on

[13:13] <tyil> how would I use it to achieve what I want?

[13:13] <nine> Foo:api<2> is incompatible with Foo:api<1> independent of a version number. By increasing :api you can explicitly mark the new version as incompatible (instead of relying on convention) and zef and rakudo will honor this by treating the module as fundamentally different to the older api version. No need for treating versions specially.

[13:14] <nine> So Bar depends on Foo:api<1>:ver<1.2.3+>. We will completely ignore any Foo:api<2>, regardless of its higher version because we know it wouldn't work.

[13:14] <nine> In a sense you could call :api semver's major version.

[13:14] <nine> It's the same concept but written in a more explicit way.

[13:15] <jnthn> Wow, I didn't know about that.

[13:15] <jnthn> nine++

[13:15] <tyil> api is not referenced in the META6.json documentation

[13:15] <tyil> I'll add it later if you don't mind

[13:16] <nine> tyil: please :)

[13:16] <tyil> and describe how it can be used to enforce a semver-like behaviour

[13:16] <tyil> does zef support the api part?

[13:16] <nine> tyil: yes

[13:16] <tyil> I've been told by the creator that I can *only* rely on the things in docs.perl6.org

[13:16] <tyil> since I cannot rely on the actual spec

[13:17] <nine> Disclaimer: since :api is not widely known, I'd not be surprised if there were a couple of bugs in various implementations. OTOH it's simply another part of matching a module's long name, like :auth

[13:18] <tyil> bugs can be resolved

[13:18] <nine> If there are bugs, we will simply fix them, yes.

[13:18] <tyil> but better docs would be the first step in getting it all right

[13:19] <tyil> are there any other things that zef supports but are not in the docs right now?

[13:19] <nine> No idea, sorry :)

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> fwiw check out this doc issue: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/764

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> it's about META6.json stuff that is not documented yet

[13:25] <MasterDuke> jnthn, et al.: any suggestions for optimizing that first case i ran (i.e., array slicing)?

[13:25] <nine> I won't be surprised if in the long term :api actually proves to be more useful to the community than :auth.

[13:26] <AlexDaniel> and given that JJ self-assigned that issue, we can resolve it very quickly if someone more knowledgeable  just says what should be there and what it does

[13:26] <MasterDuke> nine: is :api meant to be a number one can compare other numbers against? or just a string one compares for equality?

[13:26] <AlexDaniel> (hint-hint) :)

[13:31] <nine> MasterDuke: I'm not sure. The design documents only talk about "different values": http://design.perl6.org/S11.html#Tie-breaking

[13:32] <nine> Oh boy. Bug indeed. I think, I forgot to actually match on :api

[13:33] <nine> There's all the machinery for supporting it in the META6.json, in the short name lookup files and everything. Just not the actual matching

[13:34] <tyil> nine: would api be a string or an int in the META6.json?

[13:37] <tyil> and is 0 allowed as an api value?

[13:42] <nine> I think....this needs some thinking. E.g. how to upgrade from having no explicitly specified :api to actually using one. Something that can be true for all our ecosystem

[13:43] <tyil> https://github.com/Tyil/perl6-doc/commit/eeae4da112bf73c2e3ea4aae4abd1eb76b9cc10c

[13:44] <tyil> I wonder if it would make sense to split it up in mandatory and optional fields

[15:14] <[Tux]> Rakudo version 2018.02.1-175-gb75d9b1e1 - MoarVM version 2018.02-171-geee5be412

[15:38] <nine> Ok, I've now got a patch for rakudo for properly supporting :api

[15:39] <nine> There's still the open question of whether :api is a Version or a dumb string/number. I'm leaning towards the latter. You will want an exact match as the whole point of :api is that it signifies incompatibility.

[16:51] <Zoffix> Ah

[16:51] <pmurias> and the reading numbers in wrong bug causes a test fail on the js backend which doesn't stringify numbers incorrectly

[16:52] <pmurias> Zoffix: ^^ that's what the grammer does

[16:52] <pmurias> but on say node.js that doesn't give you 6.0221409e+23

[16:52] <Zoffix> I see Num.Rat does a bunch of calculations: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Num.pm6#L46-L91

[16:53] <Zoffix> It probably don't need to do 'em for FatRat and maybe even for Rat either, cause the biggest Int you can get is like 15 chars long, innit? So just pass that to constructors without doing any math.

[16:56] <Zoffix> So the largest num can be held inside a Rat pricely. Cause stuff beyond 16+ chars is noise, innit?

[16:59] <pmurias> Zoffix: isn't it 17 according to wikipedia (I'm too tired atm to pass my own judgment ;)

[16:59] <Zoffix> Still fits :)

[17:03] <pmurias> Zoffix: there are some super small nums you can't keep inside a Rat precisly

[17:04] <Zoffix> Looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic  double precision got 60bit mantissa, so the idea is we shove the mantissa into the numerator, and shove a 100000000000 (with enough zeros to divide mantissa to have 1 sigit before the dot), and the rest of the exponent zeros get simply reduced and we end up basically keeping all of the precision

[17:04] <Zoffix> all of the avilable precision that is

[17:04] <Zoffix> pmurias: the "subnormal" stuff? Do we do that for nums?

[17:05] <lizmat> hmm... I would like to import 3e8ee99116e61773f674b into the post-release-2018-03 branch

[17:05] <pmurias> Zoffix: how do you want to represent something smaller than 1/2**64 in a Rat?

[17:05] <lizmat> what would be the git magic for that ?

[17:06] <lizmat> git cherry-pick ?

[17:06] <Zoffix> lizmat: maybe `git cherry-pick 3e8ee99116e61773f674b` while on the post-release-2018.03 branch and then revert it while on master branch?

[17:06] <lizmat> Zoffix: ok, will do that

[17:07] <Zoffix> pmurias: it'd be 542101086242752/100000000000000

[17:07] <Zoffix> pmurias: I'm saying we can keep full precision available in any Num

[17:07] <Zoffix> And 1/2**64 does lose precision when converted to a Num

[17:16] <Zoffix> on (current HEAD)~1; before that last revert

[17:17] <lizmat> yeah, but what I want to add potentially could break toaster even if spectest is green

[17:17] <lizmat> the area I'm working in is really undertested  :-

[17:17] <lizmat> (

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> it could've been left in there I think

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> but ok

[17:18] <lizmat> any idea of an ETA for the release ?

[19:44] <samcv> lizmat: working on the moarvm release now

[19:54] <lizmat> samcv++

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> yay

[20:07] <AlexDaniel> please ping me when it's committed

[20:12] <tyil> nine: I'd go for a simple number (on the "api" field type)

[20:13] <timotimo> i'd say sometimes an actual name is warranted

[20:14] <timotimo> for example, what if you have some functionality that's famously implemented in a python library and a ruby library and your module wants to be exactly what the users of each library are used to; so you'd perhaps have :api<python> and :api<ruby> or names of the modules in question ro what

[20:16] <tyil> "So whenever a module author changes the module's API in a backwards

[20:16] <tyil> incompatible way (i.e. not just an extension), changing the value of :api

[20:16] <tyil> gives a signal to the use

[20:16] <tyil> "

[20:17] <tyil> as far as I can tell the intention is not to specify anything about how it is implementing an interface

[20:18] <lizmat> fwiw, I see the API as an identifier, not a version

[20:18] <lizmat> :api actually

[20:18] <tyil> also, the only reason I want it so I can reasanbly use semver standards

[20:19] <tyil> not to specify I'm going to get a vastly different interface

[20:19] <tyil> that's what module names are already good at

[20:19] <lizmat> so if you just request something with an api string, then the highest version available with that :api should be selected / loaded

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> samcv: really don't want to interrupt you from the release stuff, but can't help myself not to ask this question

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> how come this is valid?

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> yeah you can't use that in anything that takes utf-8, but why does .chr allow it in the first place?

[20:22] <AlexDaniel> m: say (0x7FFFFFFF+1).chr.ord.base(16)

[20:28] <samcv> AlexDaniel: because it's not in utf8

[20:28] <samcv> only when it gets converted to utf8 is it invalid

[20:29] <AlexDaniel> but unicode only has characters up to 0x10FFFF, right? Isn't the encoding irrelevant?

[20:30] <pmurias> what's a difference between :api and an extra name part?

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> unicodable6: U+7FFFFFFF

[20:35] <AlexDaniel> nvm I'll submit a ticket

[20:38] <samcv> AlexDaniel: but 0x10FFFF is just the limit due to limitations in utf16 and afaik characters above 0x10FFFF are just unassigned and unlikely to be assigned for the forseeable future. until they run out I suspect

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> samcv: yea but then we also have implementation-specific limit of 2147483647

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> why not bring it down to 0x10FFFF and make the implementation consistent with unicode itself

[20:40] <samcv> 2147483647 is much higher than 0x10FFFF

[22:29] <lizmat> so, which commit is causing the problem?

[22:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: (2018-02-28) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7835652d54f6538337b694f03e936a4814bec925

[22:30] <lizmat> that can only mean that it goes awol in the error reproting

[22:30] <AlexDaniel> to anyone who fixes this, please commit to master

[22:31] * lizmat is looking at it

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> there's also Zoffix self-assigned to that issue

[22:33] <lizmat> well, if I don't find it in the next 20 minutes or so, it'll have to be someone else

[22:33] <lizmat> because I need to get up early tomorrow and may not be in a position to look at it before I need to be away for the most of the day

[22:34] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I'm going to bed relatively soon also

[22:34] <Zoffix> Yeah, I marked as assigned, but was planning to stash it until later in the week.

[22:35] * Zoffix starts looking at it too

[22:37] <Zoffix> ah hehe

[22:39] <lizmat> Zoffix: ??

[22:40] <Zoffix> Well, I'm guessing it's infinilooping somewhere in UNBASE, cause there's a condition that shoves it through ":$base<$ch>" syntax again

[22:40] * Zoffix sticks debug prints in

[22:42] <Zoffix> nope :)

[22:43] <lizmat> does it actually get to UNBASE ?

[22:43] <Zoffix> no, I thought it did, but it was just a guess.

[22:43] <Zoffix> lizmat: if you wanna go to bed, then just go, I'll track it down adn fix

[22:46] <lizmat> ok, my reasoning so far:

[22:47] <lizmat> before, it was caught at compile time by the <.malformed: 'radix number'> at Grammar:3696  (I think)

[22:48] <lizmat> now I just verified it doesn't even get there

[22:54] <Zoffix> got it

[22:55] <Zoffix> yeah

[22:56] <Zoffix> There only Int candidates in Str.pm, and it's infinitlooping with that Num between Cool and Str

[22:56] <lizmat> ok
