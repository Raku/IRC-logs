[00:02] * jnthn did a blog post to explain the specializer plugin mechanism and how the speedups today were achieved: https://6guts.wordpress.com/2018/06/09/faster-dispatches-with-moarvm-specializer-plugins/

[00:08] <timotimo> "it works a few steps" sounds a few odd

[00:08] <MasterDuke> "this eliminating", probably meant "thus"?

[00:09] <timotimo> And thatâ€™s in. So what happens at runtime?

[00:09] <timotimo> ^- probably wants to be "that's it"

[00:10] <jnthn> Fixed, thanks :)

[00:10] <MasterDuke> "It was the same case story", probably mean either "case" or "story"?

[00:10] <jnthn> heck knows what I meant :)

[00:11] * jnthn decides he meant "story" :)

[00:11] * jnthn is a really awful proof reader

[00:11] <jnthn> I read it like twice and didn't spot these :)

[00:11] <MasterDuke> "every one of them as a precomputed hash table", "has a"?

[00:12] <jnthn> Yup

[00:12] <MasterDuke> heh, i'm actually kind of decent at proofing other people's work, but am terrible at my own

[00:12] <jnthn> Yeah, I think that's true of me also

[00:12] <timotimo> do we have spesh plugin output in the log yet? and if not, should i look into that?

[00:13] <jnthn> I do wonder if part of it is that I have pretty awful eyesight, and so whenever I read text I rely a lot on word shapes, which makes spotting typos hard enough as it is, but I also have fairly decent memory, and probably subconciously resolve the shapes into my recollection of the meaning. :)

[00:13] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, it's in the spesh stats

[00:14] <timotimo> ql

[00:14] <MasterDuke> "along the the conditions"

[00:15] <jnthn> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/spesh/dump.c#L631

[00:15] <MasterDuke> well, i know i make the same kind of mistake writing text as programming, where i jump ahead in my thought and skip words

[00:15] <jnthn> Oh yeah, I do that too!

[00:15] <MasterDuke> and it's hard for me to spot them even when i go back, because i subconsciously know what i meant

[00:15] <jnthn> Hands can't keep up :)

[00:16] <jnthn> I'd do it with handwriting too...always when I hit a letter in the current word that was the first letter of the next word or so :)

[00:16] <MasterDuke> one of the reasons i love the perls. they're nice an succinct, so i can type/program closer to the speed i'm thinking

[00:16] <jnthn> Indeed :)

[00:20] <timotimo> i liked that blogpost

[00:21] <hoelzro> oooo spesh plugins? neat!

[00:21] * hoelzro reads

[00:21] <geekosaur> abd then you get someone wondering why .sort didn't automatically detect dates in mdy format and sort as such instead of lexicographically.

[00:22] <timotimo> month, day, year? uuugggggghhhhhh

[00:22] <jnthn> Middle endian.

[00:22] <geekosaur> muddle endian

[00:23] <jnthn> When I first heard that term I thought "haha, that's a cute way to describe that date format", then looked it up and to my horror realized that middle endian has actually existed in software too :)

[00:24] <MasterDuke> jnthn++, very understandable

[00:25] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Cool, that was my aim :)

[00:25] <jnthn> Thanks timotimo++ and MasterDuke++ for the fixes
