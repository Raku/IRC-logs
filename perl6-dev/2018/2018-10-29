[15:08] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted!

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> do people even like these reports? I never got any feedback :D

[15:09] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: if you do thing because of feedback you expect, then nothing will happen

[15:09] <Zoffix> I glance at them once in a while, yeah

[15:09] <lizmat> *things

[15:09] <lizmat> it's sad, but it's true

[15:23] <japhb> Zoffix: I liked the treatment of the butterfly very much, both directly visually and as a reference to Rorshach blots, because I definitely feel like Perl 6 is a language where everyone can see their own thing in it.  The flame did look like a horn to me, and so I associated that with the red in Optimized for Fun, so figured there was a "go wild" aspect there.  Definitely like having Optimized for Fun 

[15:23] <japhb> right there in the logo.  The database crunching vise thing wasn't obvious to me, though I've seen that metaphor before elsewhere (especially for compression programs).  Overall a really good starting point I think.

[15:28] <pyrimidine> I like it!  Maybe make the bottom part of the 'R' the handle of the vice?

[15:29] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: you misunderstood me a bit, I think. It's open-source, I get it. I don't mind doing it, but question is if I should be doing it at all

[15:30] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: I think it's a nice addition... and it doesn't cost much effort, right ?

[15:30] <AlexDaniel> yes

[15:30] <lizmat> then let's keep it for now  :-)

[15:30] <AlexDaniel> there was a person working on automating it, by the way… and then they disappeared

[15:31] *** pmurias left
[15:31] <lizmat> yeah, it *is* open source, after all

[15:31] <AlexDaniel> last words were something like “I'm not committing yet, wanna add something. You will love it!”

[15:31] <AlexDaniel> haven't seen that person around since then :D

[15:32] <AlexDaniel> dogbert2_: I did see the discussion, but generally IMO for that benchmark we need proper data on every single commit

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> dogbert2_: here's how you can run something on a random rakudo version without compiling it: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/fb18003ca2b5e47337d8a6926f706ba0

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> as long as you're on linux and stuff, yeah, but still

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> and I definitely can't come up with a reason why we can't run a test that takes less than 2 seconds on every single commit

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> multiple times even, to denoise it

[15:36] <AlexDaniel> of course if you give me a golf I can bisect it

[22:41] <[Coke]> docs folk, testing a change to xt/examples-compilation that lets you mark a test as requiring its own file for testing; so the majority go through the EVAL path we have, but you can mark problematic ones like those containing "unit" or "is export" as requiring a separate file to run them in. (lets me get xtest passing again)
