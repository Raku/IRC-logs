[08:33] <brrt> or, can anybody else apply a one-line patch

[08:33] <lizmat> brrt: sure what is it ?

[08:33] <brrt> we're JIT compiling p6invokeunder and we really rather shouldn't

[08:34] <lizmat> what is the patch ?

[08:35] *** Ven` left
[08:35] <brrt> in src/vm/moar/ops/perl6_ops.c, for MVM_ext_register_extop(tc, "p6invokeunder", ...)

[08:36] * lizmat does

[08:39] <brrt> ty

[08:40] <brrt> lizmat: you will only see a change if you comment out the merge_bbs in src/spesh/optimize.c (moar)

[08:40] <jnthn> Or checkout the pea branch in MoarVM and build CORE.setting

[08:40] <jnthn> Which has that change

[08:40] <jnthn> I'll have to dig into what's wrong with merge_bbs at some point

[08:40] <lizmat> so the rakudo change by itself is not good ?

[08:40] <lizmat> or can I just put that in anyway ?

[08:41] <brrt> the rakudo change by itself is necessary. but it's effectiveness is only proven if you do either of those things

[08:41] <brrt> otherwise, the bug is prevented by more indirect means, namely, JIT bailing out in fortunate places

[08:43] <lizmat> ah, I thought this was a fix for the problem that is preventing App::Tasks from getting installed

[08:44] <brrt> well, hmm, I hadn't heard about that one

[08:44] <brrt> would be fortunate if it were, but I don't expect so :-)

[08:45] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2345

[08:46] <lizmat> it could well be caused by the js merge btw

[08:49] <lizmat> hmmm... seems like p6bannnerbot is not the only thing we lost

[20:27] <jnthn> lizmat: Could maybe add one that delegates to the underlying descriptor and adds "element of " at the start though; dunno how it'd look in errors

[20:28] <jnthn> Hm, that's not *quite* an assignment to %h

[20:29] <lizmat> jnthn: ^^ that's the one

[20:29] <jnthn> Ah

[20:29] <jnthn> Yeah, that's fixable as I just described

[20:29] <lizmat> well, true, but the error handling is trying to find the object's name for the error message

[20:30] <jnthn> As I remember it, there's a role that all those transient ones do

[20:30] <lizmat> ok, then I'll look at how that stuff works nowadays :-)

[20:30] <lizmat> ::Whence

[20:30] <jnthn> And it actually has a method of() { $!nested.of } or some such

[20:30] <jnthn> So you'd for the most basic solution just add a similar one for name

[20:30] <jnthn> Sounds like :)

[20:30] <lizmat> ah, ok, will try that

[20:30] <jnthn> For a fancier fix we can now sneak in an "element of " :)

[20:30] <jnthn> Which I don't think we do easily had the possibility to do before.

[20:31] <lizmat> yup, looks like
