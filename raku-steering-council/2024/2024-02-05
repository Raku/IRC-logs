[20:01] <Vushu> Dear RSC I would like to help with the development of comma ide, I think it's interresting to understand how raku is parsed and utilised, since it must be a quite complicated language to parse. I suggest to turn some of the core functionality of Comma to a language server, thereby enabling raku support for various editor that support LSP.
