[18:24] <tbrowder__> I just talked to Brian D Foy about rakudo-star and his cohorts working on windows ports of Raku modules using Chocolately. They need helpers. I woulld like to see the RSC push the Raku Foundation to support Windows versions of modules by advertising grants for such. I will contribute to that. I believe good windows support is vital for expanding use of Raku (the

[18:24] <tbrowder__> young crowd still uses windows)
