[13:36] <Geth> ¦ Raku-Steering-Council/main: review: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/commit/454a94d731

[17:38] <lizmat> <discord-raku-bot> <antononcube> Does the ban "from all Raku related spaces" includes publishing at raku.land?

[17:38] <lizmat> [18:35:04]  <lizmat> my personal opinion is that it shouldn't, but that's up to the CAT

[17:38] <lizmat> [18:37:52]  <jdv> yeah, that seems ridiculous.  publishing code is so easy whats the point?

[17:38] <lizmat> perhaps the CAT should clarify ?

[23:01] <discord-raku-bot> <roguerakudev> Just a note, Nemokosch has left the Discord for the moment. I have not heard anything from him directly, but it appears he is willing to accept the council's ban
