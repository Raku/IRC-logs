[07:38] <librasteve_> I recently received a private communication from a raku community member regarding the content of my recent raku advent post - _Day 21 - Dam Mega Christmas_. I would like to publicly apologise to any reader of the post who was affected by the text of the opening paragraphs that I realise in hindsight may be interpreted as expressing anti-Chinese and/or anti-Chinese Communist Party and/or political views. I agree 

[07:38] <librasteve_> that such words have no place in any raku community channels or posts. I have now edited the post to remove the content concerned. Sincere apologies - librasteve.

[10:23] <lizmat> FWIW, I've had privmsg contact with said community member and explained that I interpreted as an ironic way to show the kind of senseless panic that desinformation can cause

[10:23] <lizmat> a change would not have been necessary for me

[13:50] <librasteve_> thank you for the feedback, i have also heard this from the individual concerned - nevertheless i am mindful that while this community is small it has a global reach and i thought that others may have quietly thought the same
