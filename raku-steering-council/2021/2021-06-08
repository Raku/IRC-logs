[07:46] <tyil> I don't think I can make it to the coming RSC meeting on the 12th

[08:10] <lizmat> ok, well let's see if we have reason to gather at all...

[08:11] <lizmat> or that we need to change the date / time for future meetings, as the Saturday may become more difficult for others as well ?

[14:30] <vrurg> We can try finding another day, but if nothing changed in personal preferences, then Sat/Sun are the only realistic week days.

[14:50] <lizmat> well, I guess I'm the most flexible of all, so it's not going to be up to me :-)
