[19:19] <japhb> Where is the list of the official core team members?  Someone asked me, and I wasn't sure, other than possibly the "Reviewers" team on https://github.com/orgs/Raku/teams

[19:28] <lizmat> at the end of: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/announcements/20210712.md

[19:29] <japhb> Not the RSC, the core team.

[19:30] <japhb> (I just figured the RSC would need to know that, since one of the RSC powers is to handle core team ejection.)

[19:31] <lizmat> aha... ok.... hmmm...

[19:31] <lizmat> well, for clarity, added the RSC member names to the README

[19:31] <lizmat> I guess we need to look at commit bits in rakudo/rakudo ?

[19:32] <japhb> Wait, there's one less name in the README than in my announcement

[19:33] <lizmat> oops

[19:33] <lizmat> fixed now

[19:33] <lizmat> argh... need to tell Geth to log in to this channel as well

[19:35] *** Geth joined
[19:35] <lizmat> ok, future RSC commits *will* get posted here as well

[19:35] <japhb> (y)

[19:36] <japhb> Hmmm, I'm not even sure how to get the commit bit list for rakudo/rakudo.  Wouldn't that be really big though?  Or was it trimmed at some point?

[22:25] <lizmat> I believe it was trimmed at some point
