[23:17] <japhb> I reviewed the PR with some minor nits, but I also have a general question for us (we can discuss this in our next call if y'all would prefer):

[23:17] <japhb> Should membership in RSC be considered an "active" contribution?

[23:19] <japhb> Anyway, something for us to ruminate upon.
