[15:52] <lizmat> ~ 4 hours until meeting?

[16:05] <japhb> Yup, about.

[18:13] <lizmat> I think https://github.com/raku-community-modules/perl6-ioc can be removed: the upstream is more up-to-date and that *is* in the ecosystem

[19:35] <japhb> Yeah, no reason for RCM to hold on to ancient versions (the joy of DVCS: you don't have to keep all the old forks)

[19:35] <japhb> Meeting in :25.  No agenda yet.
