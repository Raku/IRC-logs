[15:17] <vrurg> Anybody to try the room today?

[15:30] * lizmat looks up the mail

[15:31] <lizmat> vrurg: I've got too many mails and links and all links so far don't work

[15:31] <lizmat> which link should I use ?

[15:31] <vrurg> https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#raku-rsc:fosdem.org

[15:31] <vrurg> Try this one, direct to the room.

[15:31] <lizmat> You are not invited to this room

[15:33] <lizmat> Ok, I needed to join first using one of the other links

[15:33] <vrurg> Right.

[15:33] <lizmat> I see vrurg's image now

[15:34] <vrurg> I've just started the conference mode.

[15:34] <lizmat> ok, I can see you

[15:46] <lizmat> grrr

[15:46] <vrurg> It looks like some testing is mandatory for everybody willing to participate.

[15:46] <lizmat> so it stops working  :-(

[15:47] <vrurg> Even though it's jitsi conferencing, but they made it working weirdishly.

[15:47] <vrurg> I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

[15:49] <vrurg> I'm back

[15:49] <vrurg> Still doesn't work?

[15:52] <lizmat> am back now

[15:53] <lizmat> but I don't see you

[16:03] <japhb> ~80% chance I'll be unable to make it tomorrow morning.  :-/

[16:04] <lizmat> meh    hope it's for good reasons!

[16:07] <japhb> New job schedule kicking my butt; I'm having major headaches early in the morning.  So ... some good, some not?

[16:13] <lizmat> I guess  :-)

[20:14] <vrurg> japhb: You mean like headaches literally?

[20:32] <japhb> vrurg: Yeah.  Like OMG, when will the tylenol and caffeine kick in so I can think?

[20:45] <vrurg> Ok. Wish you get over it sooner than later. My wife suffers from migraines and I know how bad it can be. 

[20:48] <japhb> NOD
