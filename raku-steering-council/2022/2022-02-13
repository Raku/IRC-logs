[20:43] <codesections> just fyi, I locked a ProblemSolving issue that was starting to get a little heated.  Nothing too bad, but I didn't feel like waiting to see how far it'd go. https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/313

[20:46] <japhb> Thank you, codesections 

[21:01] <vrurg> Is there any useful bits in it anyway? I didn't have time to look into it yet. But as long as I'd rather agree that min/max should have tighter precedence, I was interested in seeing all the pros/contras.

[21:21] <codesections> imo, it was a pretty disorganized/scattershot issue but there were some interesting bits scattered in.  I plan to unlock the thread tomorrow â€“ if I forget or someone else gets there first, please feel free to unlock it
