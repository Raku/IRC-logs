[00:12] <toddr> Hi, I don't think I have a single Raku talk submitted for The Perl and Raku Conference this June in Houston, TX. I'm hoping for some guidance from the Raku council on this. I'm really trying to be inclusive here. But at this point I'm asking myself if I need to take Raku off the name of the conference just so I don't confuse anyone. 

[01:46] <codesections> Thanks for reaching out.  I replied to your comment re: ^^^ on slack, but I'd be happy to discuss here if you'd prefer
