[22:23] <vrurg> Trying to chose best option for creating YouTube account. One way is to request for a non-profit organization account. It requires EIN, physical address, online contact information. I wonder if it makes sense to go this way since EIN would only be taken from The Raku Foundation DBA and I expect it to be the same as for YAS.

[22:25] <vrurg> Hm, looks more like something for asked via email.

[22:35] <vrurg> Am I the only one receiving mail delivery returns from gmail with "this message does not meet IPv6 sending guidelines regarding PTR" message?

[23:05] <japhb> Nah, that's been going for a while.  Two of the RSC members are behind gmail, I think, and so they don't get emails from the mailing list.

[23:05] <japhb> (Or at least, we see errors for it -- dunno if gmail forwards the message on anyway)

[23:08] <vrurg> 5xx are fatal codes in SMTP. No, they are not delivered.

[23:14] <japhb> (I was speaking from memory.  I didn't have one of the errors in front of me.  :-) )
