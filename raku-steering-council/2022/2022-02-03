[20:40] <vrurg> It would be nice to give a little test to Q&A panel room.

[20:41] <japhb> Sorry, have been somewhat busy.  Just started my new job.  Once I clear my head, I'll look at all the FOSDEM emails that came in this morning.

[20:44] <vrurg> I'm likely to stick around for almost all day with some pauses, perhaps. So, just anytime.

[20:45] <vrurg> The room is at https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#raku-rsc:fosdem.org

[20:45] <vrurg> Basically, they use jitsi for video. Should be nothing confusing to us.

[20:52] <japhb> Fair enough.
