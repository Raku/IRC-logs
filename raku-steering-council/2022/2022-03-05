[21:02] <codesections> Do we have a meeting today/now?  I thought we did, but I'm not finding the meeting invite or agenda

[21:05] <lizmat> well, we just finished  :-)

[21:05] <lizmat> the URL is always the same, BTW  :-)

[21:07] <codesections> Oh.  Oops!  

[21:07] <codesections> I guess that's what I get for not having the calendar event entered in

[21:09] <codesections> sorry :(  If I'm ever not there, feel free to ping me via IRC or email -- but hopefully that won't happen again
