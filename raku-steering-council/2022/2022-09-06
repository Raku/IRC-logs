[14:47] <vrurg> japhb: are you on cat mailing list?

[14:48] <japhb> vrurg: Don't think so.

[14:50] <vrurg> lizmat: could you, pls, fix it?

[19:33] <lizmat> cat mailing list ?

[19:59] <vrurg> lizmat: yes.

[20:00] <lizmat> I'm not sure what the cat mailing list is ?   

[20:00] <vrurg> Community Affairs, cat@raku

[20:00] <lizmat> aaahhh   the one I'm not on either  :-)

[20:01] <vrurg> Precisely! ;)

[20:02] <lizmat> afaics, japhb is on it

[20:02] <lizmat> the only one not on it is e

[20:02] <lizmat> me

[20:02] <vrurg> Unlikely. I've sent a mail which he hasn't seen.

[20:03] <lizmat> gb@sonic.net I assume ?

[20:03] <lizmat> :q

[20:03] <vrurg> Oh, wrong. He even has replied it. 

[20:03] <vrurg> Sorry.

[20:04] <vrurg> I just based it on his above words.

[20:04] <lizmat> ok, *phew*  :-)

[20:05] <lizmat> so is this about Nemokosch going on and on and on and pissing everybody off ?

[20:06] <vrurg> Do you really want to get into it? But, yes.

[20:06] <lizmat> no, I don't want to get into it

[20:06] <lizmat> but I can kick the discord bot

[20:07] <vrurg> And disconnect others using it. Heh...

[20:08] <vrurg> But let's get the formal side done first.

[20:14] <lizmat> I've just kicked the discord bot

[20:14] <lizmat> please continue nonetheless

[20:17] <vrurg> I'm worried that before we get a resolution he'd piss people off to the full extent of it. :(

[21:36] <japhb> gjb, not gb.  :-)

[21:41] <lizmat> that's what I meant  :-)

[21:41] <lizmat> gjb is on the list

[21:41] <japhb> Oh good.

[21:41] <vrurg> japhb: Have you seen mails from the list?

[21:42] <japhb> I don't think so, except for those sent to both lists, or which CC'ed/BCC'ed me directly.  Where are the list archives?

[21:42] <lizmat> there is no list archive as such...  except in my mail program atm

[21:45] <japhb> Fair enough, can understand wanting to protect that.

[21:45] <japhb> OK, I'm going to send a test email and see if it makes it back to me.

[21:48] <lizmat> japhb: in the server log I see several messages sent to cat@raku.org delivered to jgb@sonic

[21:51] <japhb> Is that a typo?

[21:51] <lizmat> gjb@sonic.net

[21:51] <japhb> (And I was CC'ed on several messages, hence the confusion.)

[21:52] <japhb> My test message has not come back to me.

[21:52] <japhb> So ... maybe a spam thing?

[21:52] <lizmat> your mail is been greylisted

[21:53] <japhb> Oh GOD DAMMIT.

[21:53] <lizmat> no worries...

[21:53] <lizmat> I think if your mail server tries again in 30 minutes or so, it will be ok

[21:53] <japhb> crossing fingers

[21:54] <lizmat> this one was sent from d.mail.sonic.net, the previous ones from c.mail.sonic.net

[21:55] <lizmat> d.mail wasn't seen before

[22:00] * japhb cries a little on the inside

[22:01] <lizmat> it helps me keeping spam down...  spammers generally don't retry

[22:01] * vrurg pats japhb's inner child ;)

[22:02] <japhb> Heh.  Thanks.

[22:02] <lizmat> looking at the log, looks like your mail was accepted 5 mins ago

[22:02] <japhb> My mail!  It has returned to me!

[22:02] <japhb> Thanks.

[22:02] * japhb is multitasking

[22:03] <vrurg> BTW, i dipped my toe into the version hell issue and see the light in the tunnel. We could even get $?DISTRO for some scripts.

[22:04] * lizmat takes off her sysadmin cap again

[22:04] <japhb> The Cap of Infinite Returning
