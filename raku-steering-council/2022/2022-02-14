[14:29] <vrurg> Anybody seen the email about registering raku-lang domains in China? The trademark is working.

[14:31] <japhb> vrurg: I got a raku-lang email in my spam box ... didn't realize that it was something real (figured a spammer managed to figure out my email address was associated with Raku or somesuch)

[14:36] <lizmat> Well, I guess we can send an email back on behalf of the RSC ?

[14:36] <vrurg> I found it in spam too. It was sent to rsc@raku.org and the reference to urgency makes it look suspicious. But could also be a property of Chineese style of communicating.

[14:37] <lizmat> I feel codesections has more life experience in answering these types of mails in an official manner  :-)

[14:37] <lizmat> if codesections doesn't feel up to it, I could do it also (have had to deal with trademark issues in the past, sadly enough)

[14:37] <vrurg> Perhaps it wouldn't hurt trying to reply. 

[16:42] <codesections> Hmm, I also marked that as spam without really considering it… but maybe it's worth at least looking into.  I wouldn't want us to reply without/before finding some reason to view these folks as legit (with some decent probability, anyway)

[16:45] <codesections> I note that the "from" address ends in ".net" and the signature has that URL ending in ".com" (not that email headers are that hard to spoof in the first place…)
