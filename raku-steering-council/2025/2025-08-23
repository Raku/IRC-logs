[18:19] <ugexe> I’ll be missing today’s meeting. I should be able to start attending regularly in the second half of September. My weekends have taken training to hike mt st Helen’s 

[18:20] <lizmat> ooohhh   wow... 

[18:22] <lizmat> in 2000 I visited a friend who lives nearby, and they still had a bucket filled with vulcanic ashes from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens

[18:55] <japhb> That eruption was wild.  An entire state away, it was like we were driving through a warm snowstorm ... except you really, REALLY didn't want to taste the "snow"flakes.

[18:55] <japhb> Lots of cool glass creations in the coming years though.  Melting the ash down into glass creates some great natural art when it cools.

[18:56] <japhb> And enjoy your big hike, ugexe !
