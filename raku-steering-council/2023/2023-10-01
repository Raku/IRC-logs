[21:34] <NemokoschKiwi> dear all, why is it alright to delete comments like this from public "official" repositories a minute after they land? https://imgpile.com/i/DidBvi

[21:35] <NemokoschKiwi> is there no accountability as to what "the authority" may or may not do?

[21:39] <NemokoschKiwi> especially if it's not an addressable individual who carries these actions out but "Raku" itself
