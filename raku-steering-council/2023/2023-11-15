[17:41] <codesections> lizmat: In the brainstorming session, you said that blogs need "raku programming language" in order to qualify for TIOBE.  But their page seems to say that "raku programming" is enough https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programminglanguages_definition/

[17:41] <codesections> Do you have some reason to think that "language" is also needed?

[17:42] <lizmat> well, if the context allows...  and tiobe is ok with that...  :)
