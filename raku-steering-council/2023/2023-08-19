[11:20] <NemokoschKiwi> Hello. I guess some of you are getting bored - sorry about that, same here.

[11:21] <NemokoschKiwi> What's the right way to get some work done with the raku.org hosting service? Didn't have much luck with raku-infra and perhaps it's not even the right place.

[11:22] <lizmat> is it in a form that it can be deployed?

[11:23] <lizmat> I mean, if it looks the same, but it isn't running on Perl anymore, I'm all for it to run your version

[11:23] <lizmat> deployment could be done on the "new" Raku servers and DNS change

[11:23] <lizmat> to point to the new servers

[11:24] <lizmat> I guess the first step would be to deploy it under a different name, so we could look at it ?

[11:24] <NemokoschKiwi> So the thing is, I don't know for sure how it worked so I rolled with the content of the raku.org repo, altering the update.sh script and creating two Raku script performing certain subtasks.

[11:24] <NemokoschKiwi> This misses an obvious step: the installation of the dependencies

[11:25] <lizmat> could you make it an installable dist with the appropriate META6.json?

[11:25] <lizmat> that would be a step forward, no?

[11:30] <NemokoschKiwi> yes, perhaps

[11:31] <NemokoschKiwi> this is where it gets bikesheddy, like should the whole thing be one dist, and should the scripts install in bin

[11:31] <NemokoschKiwi> or should it be a mere META6.json with a couple of dependencies and no actual "code"

[11:34] <lizmat> feels to me that it should be one dist...  but you're in a better position to determine that

[11:41] <NemokoschKiwi> oh right one more thing

[11:42] <NemokoschKiwi> one of the dependencies is LibXML, I suppose that requires the underlying C library to be installed by hand

[11:46] <lizmat> OOC, why is that dependency needed?

[11:46] <NemokoschKiwi> Atom (or RSS?) feed for the blog posts showing up on the starting page

[11:47] <NemokoschKiwi> there was a script for that, processing an ever-growing XML

[11:47] <NemokoschKiwi> well, now there is a new script

[11:49] <NemokoschKiwi> fun fact: that part isn't statically generated into the page; it's retrieved via AJAX from a prepared JSON

[11:50] <lizmat> well, that makes sorta sense, as it is updated once an hour or so

[11:51] <lizmat> I know some modules in the ecosystem require LibXML, wonder how they handle that ?

[12:10] <NemokoschKiwi> oh right, META6 creates further bikeshedding. What metadata should I put? :D

[12:13] <lizmat> mi6 new ?

[12:20] <NemokoschKiwi> um, a dist can provide 0 modules, right? lol

[12:20] <lizmat> yes, it can

[12:37] <NemokoschKiwi> okay, added a very dummy META6 file...

[12:37] <NemokoschKiwi> what do you think?

[12:39] <lizmat> if it works it works ?

[12:45] <NemokoschKiwi> feedback is welcome ^^

[12:46] <NemokoschKiwi> but anyway, it would be good to get some connection to the deployment. It's not urgent at all. It's better to be a couple of months from something than always one day from it.

[12:48] <lizmat> so a zef install . should work on your branch ?

[12:50] <NemokoschKiwi> it should

[12:50] <NemokoschKiwi> the actual content generation is easiest to trigger by calling the process-templates.raku script

[12:51] <NemokoschKiwi> (which might need a better name now that it copies all the other files as well)

[12:51] <lizmat> renaming it now would be a right time :-)

[12:52] <NemokoschKiwi> in theory, the real entry point would be update.sh

[12:56] <NemokoschKiwi> anyway, I changed it now

[12:56] <lizmat> meh not seeing updates to the repo published on any channel

[13:02] <NemokoschKiwi> the github page updates real-time

[13:03] <NemokoschKiwi> https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/184

[13:03] <lizmat> yeah, it's the type of update that isn't handled by Geth

[13:03] <lizmat> one of these days I guess I will need to look at Geth in depth  :-)
