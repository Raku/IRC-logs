[14:05] <vrurg> Do you think we must shutdown the reddit post about the hasty POD initiative?

[14:06] <lizmat> I've been thinking about it

[14:07] <lizmat> I'd rather hoped that zag would have done them themselves

[14:07] <lizmat> *that

[14:07] <vrurg> 3hrs. I've hidden it for now. Haven't deleted yet.

[14:08] <lizmat> "I have been actively involved in the Raku community for a long time."   que?

[14:08] <lizmat> maybe Perl community

[14:09] <vrurg> I didn't know if `zag` isn't Richard's other nick for reddit. So, the overall it looked to me like it's his initiative is being announced. 

[14:09] <vrurg> Until found mail notifications from Raku/doc discussion.

[14:11] <vrurg> I'm going to keep it hidden until majority decides otherwise.

[14:11] <vrurg> "Until" and "if". :)

[14:12] <lizmat> yeah, I'm fine with keeping it hidden atm

[14:12] <lizmat> I think it was totally stealing Richard's thunder and not very cooperative

[14:13] <vrurg> Agree.

[14:13] <lizmat> and he also just deleted the Github discussion

[14:13] <lizmat> after I made my opinion clear

[14:28] <japhb> What happened exactly?

[14:32] <vrurg> Do you receive email notifications from Raku/doc?

[14:46] <japhb> *pulls up email client and looks*  Hmmm, appears not.

[14:49] <lizmat> japhb: will forward the mails I git to you

[14:49] <lizmat> *got

[14:51] <lizmat> vrurg: could you bounce my reaction to me?  Github doesn't send me my own reactions

[14:51] <lizmat> japhb: mails forwarded

[14:55] <vrurg> lizmat: Forwarded

[15:00] <japhb> Thanks!

[15:01] * vrurg is afk

[15:12] <lizmat> japhb: you should have them all now

[16:14] <japhb> Thanks, lizmat

[16:14] <japhb> (and vrurg)

[17:39] <lizmat> japhb: thoughts about the messages ?

[17:57] <lizmat> vrurg: ftr, "hide" will only hide the post from yourself

[18:01] <lizmat> I've removed the post for now  (can unremove it if necessary)

[18:35] <vrurg> lizmat: thanks! I didn't know that it doesn't work as expected.

[18:36] <lizmat> yeah, I noticed the # points changing and wondered how that was possible, that's how I found out  :-)

[19:19] <japhb> Apologies, just got back from my weekly appointment.

[19:21] <japhb> So: I think being told about Richard's work and then beating him to the announcement is pretty rude, especially as Richard was being very careful to involve people more thoroughly.

[19:21] <japhb> I haven't read the original post yet, however, just the discussion back and forth in the emails.

[19:24] <japhb> I think the time to bring up competing options is more like in the timing of Git and Mercurial.  IIRC: Git MVP announced, Mercurial guy announces he's got another angle on it, asks if Linus will consider his option if it's good enough, hackhackhack, turns out the two were optimized for different use cases so Linus stays with Git, both projects go on to great things in slightly different 

[19:24] <japhb> spaces because they address slightly different needs.

[19:25] <japhb> That may be a rosy picture mind you -- it's the one I remember from back when it happened.

[19:26] <japhb> What I really don't want is someone calling *Richard* the late-to-the-party person, since he went so far as to bring it to the core summit for consideration, which indicates some serious intent.

[19:28] <japhb> I'm not sure what constitutes the "Raku community" besides such summits/gatherings, these #raku* channels, and the appropriate blog/twit/reddit discussion spaces.  In other words, if it doesn't show up in RWN, does it exist, community-wise?

[19:33] <japhb> One thing I'm glad about is that at least you posted/linked to the RSC meeting notes on Monday.
