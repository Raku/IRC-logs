[19:33] <vrurg> Sorry, but I'll skip today's meeting. F*ing russians destroyed a section of a house in my home city, Dnipro. Just ~1km away from where I used to live.

[19:34] <lizmat> ok, then maybe we should skip

[19:34] <lizmat> because nine and jj won't be there either

[22:48] <vrurg> Should I reschedule in two weeks or one week?

[22:49] <vrurg> lizmat: BTW, what we forgot about is a redirection to The Raku Foundation page.

[22:49] <lizmat> reschedule for the 22nd  if ok with you?

[22:50] <lizmat> can't make it on the 21st

[22:52] <lizmat> codesectiions and ugexe were already ok with it

[22:52] <lizmat> japhb won't be available until February
