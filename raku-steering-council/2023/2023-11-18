[19:33] <ugexe> I’ll be taking the meeting today in the car, so it’s probably safe to skip the potential topics I mentioned via email 

[19:47] <japhb> Should we move the meeting then?

[19:48] <ugexe> That also works for me, but I’ll be out of the country next Saturday 

[19:56] <lizmat> I think we'll enough discussing codesections suggestions :-)

[19:58] <japhb> OK

[20:02] <lizmat> japhb: meeting ?

[20:02] <lizmat> codesections: meeting ?

[20:02] <japhb> BAH, have to deal with a life thing.  May be in in a minute
