[23:06] <japhb> How do I go about debugging zef?  I have tried cloning zef into a new directory next to the one I'm trying to locally install, and done `perl6-debug-m -I ../zef/lib ../zef/bin/zef install .`, but even that dies before actually getting me anywhere I can do anything.  At this point I'm reduced to inserting `dd` calls all over the place, but I feel like there's got to be some better way.

[23:30] <japhb> GAH, I found the problem (yes, using dd :-P  ) -- I had "depends" : [ "Foo::Bar:ver('0.0.7')" ] where I needed "depends" : [ "Foo::Bar:ver<0.0.7>" ] .

[23:30] <japhb> Where is this documented?

[23:31] <japhb> And why does zef crash rather than indicating an unparsed dependency?
