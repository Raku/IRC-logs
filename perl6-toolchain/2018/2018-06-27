[16:38] <kalkin--> hi

[16:42] <kalkin--> Is there somewhere documented the current state of the META6.json file spec?

[16:42] <kalkin--> Is it planned to have a field for the repo url in it?

[16:43] *** kalkin-- is now known as kalkin-

[18:02] <tyil> kalkin-:yes

[18:02] <tyil> https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6.json-META6.json

[18:03] <tyil> and yes, the source-url is already used by some, but afaik they also plan to make it a default Soon(tm)

[18:03] <tyil> I personally don't use it because it's not officially supported yet
