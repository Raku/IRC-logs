[11:41] <lizmat> "source-url" : "git://github.com/bduggan/p6-rdf-turtle.git"

[11:41] <lizmat> "source-url" : "https://github.com/bduggan/p6-rdf-turtle.git"

[11:41] <lizmat> the former appears on modules.perl6.org as the link to the repor

[11:42] <lizmat> the latter doesn't: is the use of https:// wrong in this context, or should  modules.perl6.org be fixed ?

[14:10] <japhb> lizmat: You can check which URLs are acceptable from the GitHub UI by pulling down the "Clone or download" dropdown at a repo root.  In this particular case, https://github.com/user/repo.git is the default form (partly IIRC because it's more firewall-friendly); git:... is for those who prefer SSH to HTTPS for security.

[14:12] <lizmat> ok, so you're saying it's a problem with modules.perl6.org, right ?

[14:14] <japhb> Originally IIRC people were allowed to list either https:// or git:// in their repo info, I'm guessing modules.perl6.org is just following whatever people put in that metadata.

[14:15] <japhb> Personally I think we should pick one as standard for each of the repo hosting sites (probably the https://) and have the tools (zef, etc.) able to autoconvert for you.

[14:15] <japhb> "enough magic to make users happy"

[14:19] <lizmat> well, I have quite a few modules to change should the url have to start with git://

[14:19] <lizmat> :-(

[14:19] <lizmat> will do it if necessary, but still...  if the problem is more widespread ecosystem-wise

[14:19] <lizmat> then maybe we should indeed handle this more centrally  :-)

[19:30] <japhb> Well, at the very least we can know the supported URL formats for GitHub and GitLab and have zef and modules.perl6.org just magically map them (or perhaps display both forms)
