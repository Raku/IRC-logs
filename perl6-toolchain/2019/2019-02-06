[19:49] <leont> lizmat: I think I figured out where your out-of-filedescriptor bug with harness6 comes from, and the fix is fairly easy, though I haven't been able to reproduce it yet

[19:51] <lizmat> leont++

[19:51] <leont> Unlike prove6, harness6 ignores stderr. To do this it opens /dev/null for every test, but doesn't close it.

[19:52] <leont> Most obvious solution would be to open it only once, and reuse that handle

[19:52] <lizmat> aha!

[19:52] <lizmat> yup, that sounds like a plan: I guess multiple threads writing on that will not have any synchornization issues  :-)

[19:53] <leont> On second though, it's probably even better to write my own IO::Handle that noops. I don't think anything really depends on the handle being a true handle

[20:05] <leont> Erm, no i can't, because it needs a real fd for Proc::Async. devnull it isâ€¦
