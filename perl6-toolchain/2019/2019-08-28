[09:00] <domidumont> Hi, On Debian/unstable with libuv 1.30.1, rakudo fails installation with "No writeable path found, /home/domi/debian-dev/build-area/rakudo-2019.07.1/debian/rakudo/usr/lib/perl6/core not writeable"

[09:00] <domidumont> We've seen this problem occurs with rakudo 2018.12 and 2019.07

[09:01] <domidumont> For instance see this build log https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=rakudo&arch=amd64&ver=2018.12-5%2Bb1&stamp=1565163228&raw=0

[09:03] <domidumont> Note that rakudo 2018.12  did build fine with libuv 1.24.1

[09:03] <domidumont> Any idea on how to fix this issue ?

[09:11] <kawaii> domidumont: you may want to ask in #perl6 instead, this channel is unused :)

[09:16] <domidumont> kawaii: ok, thanks
