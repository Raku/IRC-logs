[21:29] <TreyHarris> If this should go to #perl6, please lmk, but I in starting to package up a module for upload, I noticed that my use of META6.pm6 meant that every time I made any change to my META6, the resulting json's order got shuffled. Is there an easy way to keep it stable so I don't have so many useless diff lines? Digging about the code in META6 didn't show me a 'sort' option or something...

[21:35] <TreyHarris> Ah, I see it probably isn't the right channel. Sorry about that.
