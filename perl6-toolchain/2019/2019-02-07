[01:04] <leont> Crap, my fix doesn't appear to fix it

[01:05] <leont> Though eliminating the :err('ignore') argument does seem to prevent the error (when I set ulimit -n to 64), so the problem analysis was probably correct.

[01:05] <leont> It is kind of shocking how many warnings I see now though

[01:20] <leont> It seems the state variable isn't doing what I expect, that is weird…

[01:49] <leont> Found it. A rakudobug in state…

[01:50] <leont> Either that, or state does something very different from what I expected it to do
