[00:05] <colomon> (the reason I ask is because it seems to me this scheme requires the topmost version of .perl to somehow define anonymous variables that can be used in lower levels -- which again seems like a significant overhead to the .perl implementor.)

[00:07] <TimToady> all you need is a lexical scope to contain any variables declared en passant

[00:08] <sjohnson> chess!

[00:08] <TimToady> temp varnames could be stored in the seen hash if the can't be regenerated from self.WHICH

[00:08] <TimToady> as for threading, that's why contextual variables aren't p5ish local vars

[00:09] <TimToady> so they're automatically thread-local

[00:20] <dalek> nqp-rx/nom: A refactor of P6opaque to start to prepare the way for natively typed attributes. Along the way, this slashes a memory allocation per object instantiation, meaning that it's now just the PMC header and the object body. Given there's no RPA for attributes any more, this boils down to half the number of allocations and half the number of GCables for 6model objects compared to current Parrot objects.

[11:13] <masak> heh. late start today. I guess I got carried away reviewing p1 submissions yesterday :)

[11:17] <moritz_> masak: how did you like the solutions so far?

[11:18] <jnthn> masak: lol, I only just got up too :)

[11:18] <masak> moritz_: they are generally of high quality. not much to complain about, really.

[11:19] <masak> moritz_: I won't spoil the blog post entirely, but among the p1 ones, there are three which do DP, one that is correct but slow, and one that is fast but wrong.

[11:20] *** cogno left
[11:22] <moritz_> .oO( it's easy to get the wrong result in O(1) )

[11:23] <masak> this one does it in linear time.

[11:23] <jnthn> Heh. I shoulda submitted say "OMG GIRAFFE!"; for all of them, then claimed that I had the fastest program for every problem.

[11:23] <masak> the correct-but slow one grows as O( n! )

[11:23] <arnsholt> The brute-force approach. Always a classic =)

[11:23] <masak> jnthn: you could've. but you wouldn't have won. :)

[11:24] <arnsholt> I kinda want to figure out how the O(n log n) algorithm for matrix chain works though

[11:24] <masak> arnsholt: do you have an URL for that one?

[11:24] <arnsholt> Sounded kinda nifty, based on triangulation of regular polygons, apparently

[11:24] <masak> I think I'd like to throw it into the blog post.

[11:25] <masak> huh? polygons? in p1? :)

[11:25] <arnsholt> I got the reference from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication#An_Even_More_Efficient_Algorithm 

[11:25] <arnsholt> ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/81/875/CS-TR-81-875.pdf

[11:25] <arnsholt> Yeah, polygons apparently =)

[11:25] <moritz_> I figured it was over my head :-)

[11:26] <masak> arnsholt: thanks.

[11:27] <arnsholt> moritz_: I looked a bit at the paper and decided I didn't have time to figure it out

[13:22] <arnsholt> Good thing I blew the deadline then, since three out of four of my solutions had a lib/ with a module file in it =)

[13:26] <arnsholt> You can't make notes on that though, obviously

[13:27] <masak> hm. more thinking is required.

[13:27] <colomon> Is "exit say" actually a good idiom?  I mean, it looks pretty, but if there is a problem with the say it will return the wrong exit value, no?

[13:28] <jnthn> colomon: It may be too cute. I had mixed feelings when I saw it. :)

[13:28] <masak> it's probably not a good idea for bigger programs.

[13:28] <jnthn> It is going to aways give a non-zero exit code

[13:28] <masak> but the fact remains that &say currently always returns 1

[13:29] <jnthn> So in that sense it's "good enough"

[13:29] <masak> right.

[13:49] <prashant_> hi everyone

[13:50] <prashant_> I was learning perl for last few days and got hypnotised by the language doings

[13:50] <prashant_> I would like to contribute in some of the projects

[13:50] <mathw> Hello

[13:50] <prashant_> can you please give me some pointers about how to start with?

[13:50] <prashant_> @mathw : hello

[13:51] <shortcircuit> prashant_: Perl != Perl6. Are you familiar with the difference?

[13:52] <prashant_> nope

[13:52] <prashant_> let me google it

[13:52] <shortcircuit> Heh

[13:53] <prashant_> yeah got it

[13:53] <prashant_> but still interested

[13:53] <jnthn> prashant_: Perl 5 is widely used in production today, mature, and has plenty of exciting stuff going on. Perl 6 is in development, not widely used yet, and also has lots of ways to get involved. Since things are at an earlier stage there's a lot more gaps to be filled.

[13:53] <shortcircuit> Hm.

[13:54] <shortcircuit> Ways you might help.

[13:54] <prashant_> hmm

[13:54] <jnthn> prashant_: Really, it's finding something you like doing and doing it. :) There's some ideas on http://www.perl6.org/getting-started/involved

[13:54] <shortcircuit> Oh, cool. There's a page for that? :)

[13:54] <shortcircuit> BTW, what's the Perl 6 analog for CPAN?

[13:54] <mathw> Of course

[13:55] <jnthn> shortcircuit: http://modules.perl6.org/ has the current module list; the whole ecosystem is evolving. tadzik++ is doing lots of work on that, including toolchain bits.

[13:56] <shortcircuit> Cool.

[13:58] <shortcircuit> flussence: What Gentoo arch do you run? I'm in the process of installing amd64 generic, so I might be able to assist with maintenance of a rakudo ebuild, but I don't expect I'll want to take the time to bounce against other profiles.

[14:33] <[Coke]> masak;it would be nice if http://strangelyconsistent.org/p6cc2010/ stated the problem description for p1.

[14:36] <[Coke]> ah, it's on the calling page. 

[14:41] <PerlJam> Today is the first time my Perl 6 coding has caused a real problem in my Perl 5 code.

[14:43] <PerlJam> I've been doing stuff with PDL and used +@array for it's perl6 meaning when creating some piddles and it caused a segfault that took me a while to figure out.

[14:44] <jnthn> piddle! LOL! :D

[14:45] <mathw> I keep writing for loops in Perl 6 way

[14:45] *** cogno left
[14:46] <takadonet> I keep running into situations in p5 code where  I want a junction

[14:47] <jnthn> (Yes, there's an app^Wmodule for that... :))

[14:47] <jnthn> PerlJam: Aye. :)

[14:48] <PerlJam> most of my other Perl6->Perl5 problems have been minor and syntactical  (like forgetting the parens on a given/when)

[14:49] <PerlJam> I guess this one was too, but it took me a while to figure out what I did wrong

[14:49] <jnthn> I would mention that I forget the ; after eval { ... } - but I did that even before I had Perl 6 to influence me. :)

[14:59] <takadonet> since when it's a compile time error to put parentheses right beside a key word?

[15:03] <PerlJam> Perl is just optimistic about functions it hasn't seen yet.

[15:04] <PerlJam> maybe there should be some pragma that warns for functions that aren't defined before they are used.

[15:06] <mathw> I would expect it'd complain when it got to the point where it could realise the function was undefined, but it notices the undefined $a first

[15:09] <colomon> rakudo: my $a; my($a)=5; say $a;

[15:09] <p6eval> rakudo 388eed: OUTPUT«Could not find sub &my␤  in main program body at line 22:/tmp/fxgroTrysB␤»

[19:21] <diakopter> agh; the lagh

[19:21] <felliott> #72826 is a dupe of #73280

[19:21] <pmichaud> yes

[19:22] <pmichaud> under "Links" there's an option for "merge into"

[19:22] *** kaare_ left
[19:22] <pmichaud> in general we try to merge newer tickets into older ones

[19:22] *** kaare_ joined
[19:22] <felliott> Ahh, thanks.

[19:23] <felliott> In this case the newer one has more info.  Should I copy it over?

[19:23] *** plobsing joined
[19:23] <pmichaud> the merge will combine the info from both tickets

[19:23] <pmichaud> i.e., the merged ticket will have all of the information from both

[19:26] *** MayDaniel joined
[19:26] <felliott> Thanks!  I was able to merge them.

[19:27] *** bluescreen left
[19:28] <dukeleto> pmichaud: i am close to adding a "make smoke" target to nqp-rx, but I need to use a test harness that can create TAP archives. Do you mind if I use t/harness.pir from Parrot ? I just wanted to ask you explicitly.

[19:38] <tadzik> yes

[19:40] *** kaare_ joined
[19:42] <jnthn> pmichaud: If you have a moment, I'd like to get your thoughts on how to handle nqp-rx => nqp-rx/nom migration issues.

[19:42] <jnthn> pmichaud: As you mentioned before, there's a sense in which it's a "different product".

[19:43] <jnthn> pmichaud: I know it won't (can't) be a seamless transition, so replacing the parrot-nqp.exe in the Parrot repo with the "new nqp" is almost certainly not going to work out.

[19:43] <jnthn> I think it'll have to be more like what we did before with nqp => nqp-rx.

[19:44] <pmichaud> we can't replace parrot-nqp.exe with a new one because... we don't have the object model stuff in parrot to support it?

[19:44] *** bluescreen joined
[19:44] <jnthn> Kinda, yeah.

[19:44] <jnthn> Also some semantic mis-matches.

[19:44] <jnthn> The multiple dispatch works wiht the new object model stuff.

[19:44] <pmichaud> well, let me ask that more directly -- why can't we have a parrot-nqp in the parrot repo?

[19:44] <pmichaud> i.e., what are the blockers?

[19:45] <pmichaud> (I grant there are some... I'm just wanting a feel for what they are)

[19:45] <jnthn> It's mostly lack of backward compatibility.

[19:46] <pmichaud> that doesn't make any sense to me

[19:46] <pmichaud> i.e., backward compatibility shouldn't be an issue

[19:46] <jnthn> Maybe I mis-understood the question.

[19:46] <pmichaud> okay, let me rephrase it a different way

[19:46] <jnthn> We certainly *can* put the new NQP stuff I've been doing into the Parrot repo. Provided we handle its dynop and dynpmc library.

[19:47] <pmichaud> okay (more)

[19:47] <pmichaud> at a nqp-source level, nqp code should pretty much work as before, yes?

[19:47] <jnthn> We probably can't replace the current version of NQP in the Parrot repo with what I've got in nqp-rx/nom

[19:47] *** kaare__ joined
[19:47] <jnthn> Yes, pure NQP source isn't the problem.

[19:47] <pmichaud> I'm asking what is the blocker there.  :-)

[19:47] *** kaare_ left
[19:48] <jnthn> Ah, OK. I can list a few. :)

[19:48] <jnthn> 6model doesn't support inheriting from PMCs at the moment, nor from Parrot classes. I may be able to partially pull it off, but I'm not sure it's a good use of time when Parrot folks are already considering switching to 6model or something like it for Parrot itself anyway.

[19:49] *** cogno left
[19:49] <jnthn> Note that having attributes storing PMCs or stuff from P6metaclass or Parrot objects is no problem at all.

[19:49] <jnthn> It's when inheritance is needed that we hit issues.

[19:49] <jnthn> A harder one is that multi-dispatch currently only knows about 6model objects.

[19:50] <jnthn> I'm not sure that'll be too easy to handle.

[19:50] <pmichaud> I don't think that there are many instances of nqp programs (well, except for parrot-built utilities) that really need inheritance from pmc classes

[19:50] <jnthn> Yes, the Parrot built utilities are my big worry here.

[19:50] <jnthn> I think for people using NQP to build compilers, this should be a smooth transition.

[19:51] <jnthn> For folks using it as a nicer way to interact with Parrot than writing PIR, I think it will be harder.

[19:51] <pmichaud> parrot-built utilities using nqp are likely to get a significant change anyway, since bacek++ is working on a nqp-based version of PIR and PAST/POST

[19:51] *** molaf joined
[19:51] <pmichaud> there are migration issues with that also.

[19:51] <jnthn> Yes

[19:52] <pmichaud> anyway, at this moment I tend to agree that the new nqp(s) are separate products from the existing nqp-rx

[19:52] <pmichaud> and so we may handle it much like pge -> nqp-rx; i.e., leave the existing nqp alone for backwards compatibility, create a new nqp-ish environment for people to migrate to

[19:52] <pmichaud> migration should be far easier this time since it's mostly at a hll (nqp) level, I think.

[19:53] <jnthn> Yes, people won't have to go re-doing their grammars and stuff like that.

[19:53] <jnthn> Well, I guess maybe they didn't *have* to last time...

[19:53] <pmichaud> most did, because of changes to things like protoregexes and the base grammar classes

[19:54] <pmichaud> but that shouldn't be the difference this time

[19:54] <jnthn> Right.

[19:54] *** kaare__ left
[19:54] <pmichaud> this time the changes are likely to be in PAST API stuff, I think.

[19:54] <jnthn> Yes, and also at the interface between NQP and the VM.

[19:54] *** kaare__ joined
[19:54] <pmichaud> which comes to my next question -- what issues do we need to keep in mind to keep CLR capability?

[19:55] *** kaare__ left
[19:55] <pmichaud> or did you want to focus on parrot for the first step?

[19:55] <jnthn> nqpclr is looking quite good overall in terms of what it's capable of.

[19:55] <jnthn> I think we need to try and reify/declare a bit more when VM specific stuff is going on.

[19:55] <pmichaud> is it very divergent from nqp-nom?  what's the current relationship between the two?

[19:56] <jnthn> There's a lot in common.

[19:56] <jnthn> If we s/pir::/nqp::/ in the Parrot one, it gets even closer.

[19:56] <pmichaud> okay

[19:57] <jnthn> The way you write meta-objects on both is identical.

[19:57] *** Vlavv left
[19:57] <jnthn> The 6model implementation on both is pretty much API compatible.

[19:57] <pmichaud> is it unreasonable to shoot for (not immediate step, but medium-term)  having a single nqp implementation that can self-host on both parrot and clr?

[19:57] <jnthn> There's some case where one leads the other in a given feature.

[19:58] <jnthn> Medium-term, that's what I want pretty much.

[19:58] <pmichaud> same here.

[19:58] <jnthn> And what I've been keeping in mind.

[19:58] <pmichaud> the -rx part of nqp-nom is still heavily dependent on PIR/Parrot right now?

[19:58] <jnthn> Yeah

[19:58] <pmichaud> how about past/post?

[19:58] <jnthn> In two ways

[19:59] <tadzik> Unicode property 'OtherAlphabetic' not found -- from the failing test

[19:59] <jnthn> 1) It doesn't use 6model yet. That I can likely get fixed up.

[19:59] <jnthn> 2) Large swathes of it are in PIR. That's much more challenging.

[19:59] <jnthn> PAST/POST - we don't actually need to switch those right now.

[19:59] <pmichaud> they don't need new base classes?  or you did that already in -nom?

[20:00] <TimToady> phone?

[20:00] <pmichaud> phone!

[20:00] <jnthn> We don't need them to at the moment.

[20:00] <jnthn> The thing is that our only interaction with them is to instantiate them and call methods.

[20:00] <pmichaud> ah, so they can remain traditional Parrot objects w/o difficulty?

[20:00] <jnthn> -nom is just fine with doing that stuff with objects from other object implementations.

[20:00] <pmichaud> Pretty.

[20:00] <jnthn> Yes, that I have managed to make work pretty effortlessly.

[20:00] <pmichaud> Shiny.

[20:01] *** coldhead joined
[20:01] <jnthn> What is different is that 6model is...erm...annoying...to use directly from PIR.

[20:01] <pmichaud> that's okay, I think.

[20:01] <jnthn> Or at least

[20:01] *** cogno joined
[20:01] <jnthn> It won't be able to take advantage of the optimizations in a sane way when they land.

[20:01] <pmichaud> (phone omw)

[20:02] <pmichaud> I'm not too worried about that.  I expect/hope we'll be eliminating huge parts of PIR anyway.

[20:02] <jnthn> What I'm looking at is moving Cursor stuff into a class (in NQP) but leaving various methods having PIR bodies.

[20:02] <pmichaud> oh, I'm thinking Cursor could become heavily NQP

[20:02] <pmichaud> it was somewhat designed that way at the outset; I just never went back and nqp-ized it.

[20:03] <jnthn> diakopter++ has already done a bunch of stuff on that in the 6model repo for nqpclr

[20:03] <pmichaud> (and I was also dealing with efficiency concerns)

[20:03] *** MayDaniel left
[20:03] <jnthn> Yes, well, that's what I think we've hit in nqpclr too.

[20:03] <[Coke]> does felliott still need privs?

[20:03] <pmichaud> what sort of overall timeframe are you wanting?

[20:03] <pmichaud> [Coke]: I added him

[20:03] * diakopter blinks into attention

[20:03] <pmichaud> (so no)

[20:04] * diakopter finishes backlogging

[20:04] <jnthn> pmichaud: I think nqp-rx/nom will be at the point where I'm ready to start re-working Rakudo to use it and 6model in about 2 weeks.

[20:04] <jnthn> pmichaud: I'm fine with working against a Parrot branch initially. Of course, will be doing the work in a git branch.

[20:05] <[Coke]> pmichaud: danke.

[20:05] *** Layla_91 joined
[20:05] <Layla_91> Knock, Knock! :D

[20:05] <jnthn> I can find ways to work with a separate, out-of-Parrot, nqp-rx/nom for a while if it's blocking me.

[20:05] <jnthn> Layla_91: Привет!

[20:05] <pmichaud> so, you'd like to see a nqp-nom in the parrot repo in about 2 weeks (more)

[20:05] <Layla_91> jnthn: You kow russian! yahooooo! :D

[20:06] <pmichaud> or, we have a rakudo branch that loads+builds nqp as part of its configure/build process (like we did in the early stages of rakudo-ng)

[20:06] <jnthn> Layla_91: A little. :) I'm really bad. :(

[20:06] <jnthn> pmichaud: I'm fine with either way.

[20:06] <Layla_91> jnthn: I will teach you all the basics.. come to Russia soon and all your beer will be on me :D

[20:06] <pmichaud> I prefer to have nqp-nom in the parrot repo somehow; far easier to manage

[20:07] <[Coke]> oooh, free language lessons AND beer? awesome.

[20:07] <jnthn> pmichaud: I think so too. My concern actually isn't for me immediately.

[20:07] <jnthn> Layla_91: Wow! :D

[20:08] <jnthn> pmichaud: It's more that at some point I'll want @other to join the hacking and or test there stuff on it.

[20:08] <jnthn> pmichaud: And low barrier to entry is helpful for that.

[20:08] <pmichaud> I'd like also like to see nqp-nom in parrot so parrot hackers can start looking at it and seeing its effects

[20:08] <Layla_91> [Coke]: You can come too :)

[20:08] <jnthn> pmichaud: Of course, me not having to build temporary stuff also helps. ;)

[20:08] <pmichaud> anyway, two weeks seems very doable

[20:08] <jnthn> Layla_91: Will certainly be there in May for the YAPC::Russia. :)

[20:08] *** Vlavv joined
[20:08] <pmichaud> (assuming there aren't any other major surprises that come)

[20:09] *** kjeldahl joined
[20:09] <Layla_91> jnthn: Deal! :D

[20:09] <pmichaud> any other surprises I should know about?  ;-)

[20:09] <jnthn> pmichaud: OK, any tuits you have towards it are very helpful.

[20:09] <jnthn> pmichaud: Er...

[20:09] <dukeleto> YAPC::EU looks like it is going to be fun. I am seriously thinking about going.

[20:09] <Layla_91> [Coke]: It is easy.. take a plane and come XD

[20:10] <pmichaud> jnthn: I think the next step is for me to build nqp-nom and see what I think :-)

[20:10] <jnthn> pmichaud: Maybe you should know that 6model on JVM managed to start up, init 6model, initialize its (rather trimmed down) setting...and run hello world.

[20:10] <jnthn> It passes a few tests too.

[20:10] <jnthn> mberends++ for porting that lot :)

[20:10] <jnthn> Anyway, it's a very reassuring that the model works so far on 3 different VMs.

[20:11] <pmichaud> jnthn: okay, in the next 3 or 4 days I'll get nqp-nom installed and running on my box and add my reactions to that (more)

[20:11] <jnthn> That doesn't demand your attention, anyways. It's just nice that it's happening.

[20:11] <dukeleto> jnthn: it is very exciting to watch 6model evolve

[20:11] <pmichaud> I'll also see about getting the clr version running, just to see it

[20:11] <jnthn> pmichaud: OK. :)

[20:11] <jnthn> pmichaud: Oh, I dunno if I made it clear...

[20:11] <jnthn> pmichaud: nqp-rx's multi handling does all the proto stuff properly now

[20:12] <jnthn> pmichaud: So it enters the proto and the * or {*} enters the dispatcher.

[20:12] <jnthn> Also it can handle :U vs :D

[20:13] <jnthn> So it's more than just "multi dispatch with 6model types", it's "multi dispatch that follows the latest spec", though it's missing all the stuff like constraints and sub-sigs and stuff (which I think will never go into nqp-rx).

[20:13] <jnthn> Note that nqpclr supports all of this too, already.

[20:14] <jnthn> pmichaud: Finally, pop https://github.com/jnthn/6model/blob/master/overview.pod on your reading list. I writed docs!!1!! :)

[20:15] <pmichaud> (on phone)

[20:16] <pmichaud> yes I understood that multi handling did proto stuff now

[20:16] <cogno> I discover that Riga has a lot of art nouveau. I want to go if health and finance are good

[20:17] <pmichaud> anyway, once I see the codebase I think I'll have a really good idea of what we need to focus on next

[20:17] <pmichaud> it does sound very similar to the rakudo-ng transition

[20:17] <jnthn> OK. Warning, rough edges. ;)

[20:17] <pmichaud> np, we had rough edges before :)

[20:18] <pmichaud> anyway, my goal will be to have a draft roadmap for migration by Sunday

[20:18] <jnthn> If you can, that'd be outstanding, and very helpful.

[20:18] <pmichaud> I'll also look at bacek's work and figure out where it should fall into things

[20:18] <pmichaud> I'm pretty sure I can do that by Sunday

[20:19] <pmichaud> I've been reconfiguring my work environment here at the house to make it more productive for me again

[21:07] <flussence> I'm really overdue for a new one, but I tend to use them left-handed which rules out the "ergonomic" ones...

[21:09] <masak> flussence: you could really use a fourth spatial dimension to get a left-handed ergonomic mouse.

[21:11] *** bacek_ left
[21:13] <masak> I had this idea for a short story today, about objects that stuck together through an (invisible) fourth spatial dimension. you rotated one, the other one would go as a moon around it. or you could put one in the attic and swing freely from the other.

[21:14] <flussence> .oO( and then something 4D nudges them slightly out of place, and you get horribly dismembered... )

[21:15] <masak> well, the thing is that the extra dimension would be entirely inaccesible, and otherwise totally undetectable. no 4D monsters or anything.

[21:15] <masak> I bet lue would appreciate this idea.

[21:19] <flussence> (I wonder if that's how ball lightning works :)

[21:20] <flussence> (although typing "4d ball lightning" into google suggests that nobody would agree)

[22:06] <jnthn> Anyway, http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/dddd/index.htm agrees that it's not a valid unicode char.

[22:06] <jnthn> Seems that "for UTF-8 encoding" is kinda misleading.

[22:06] <jnthn> If it's not a valid unicode char, I'd not expect it to work on any encoding.

[22:06] <flussence> 0xd800..0xdfff are utf-16 surrogate chars, so it makes no sense to have them in utf-8.

[22:07] <jnthn> Oh...I see.

[22:07] <jnthn> oh, you're right...

[22:07] *** dorlamm joined
[22:07] <jnthn> It's valid just not alone.
