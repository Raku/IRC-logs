[00:02] *** dual left
[00:02] <TimToady> or event-streamy

[00:03] <TimToady> up till now, we've been trying to sweep event filters under the carpet of feed operators

[00:04] <TimToady> though it's not clear whether bonded upstream-downstream filters are well supported by our current model

[00:06] <TimToady> there's also some of the flavor of "are strings really lists of chars instead of scalars oh wait that's too slow" about the whole thing

[00:08] <lichtkind> tadzik: do you know which modules have some final or productive stauts?

[00:08] <TimToady> in any case we can probably plug a PerlIO workalike extension into P6 more easily than P5

[00:09] <TimToady> which takes some of the pressure off trying to put it into the core langauge

[00:09] <TimToady> *guage

[00:10] <lichtkind> but qp/.../ ~~ :d will become official syntax?

[00:11] <TimToady> it will until it won't :)

[03:17] <wolfman2000> grad school is done for now: finished up first summer

[03:17] <wolfman2000> C++ programing for StepMania has picked up, and I finally managed to include some features.

[03:17] * sorear has mostly spent the last year messing with Perl 6.

[03:18] <wolfman2000> how stable is it now?

[03:19] <sorear> what, Perl 6?

[03:19] <wolfman2000> yes

[03:19] <sorear> *shrug* seems fairly stable.

[03:20] <TimToady> it's stable enough to have almost 300 working examples on rosettacode.org that are expected to continue working for the most part

[03:21] <wolfman2000> ...okay, this looks like a webpage I should visit more often

[03:21] <sorear> I've been maintaining a 13kloc program since January and haven't had any *major* issues with the semantics changing out from under me

[10:13] <kboga> small patch to fix some typo and the missing % operator: http://pastebin.com/Gd1kynKh (btw, both nom's Actions.pm and NQP's NQP.pir seem to have mod_i        => 'mod__Iii',)

[10:15] <moritz> kboga: thank you. Unfortunately I can't apply it right now (I'm on the wrong machine)

[16:39] <moritz> ah, probably not needed

[16:39] <moritz> nevermind

[16:40] <pmichaud> since they're using =, they're already using container_store :-)

[16:41] <moritz> yes, I noticed after asking

[16:41] <pmichaud> i.e., every assignment in the core gets equally optimized by the above patch :)

[16:41] <moritz> \o/

[16:43] <TimToady> PerlJam: I felt sorry to put the map in, but I needed to vary the left side of X~ faster than the right

[16:44] <TimToady> mabye RXR~ would work...

[16:44] <TimToady> or something...

[16:44] <mikemol> pmichaud: Isn't there still a level of indirection between ++/-- and container_store, simply due to calling =?

[16:45] <TimToady> sorear: also had to work around a couple buggies

[16:45] <mikemol> (Just an educated guess; I've not looked at the source code)

[16:45] <moritz> mikemol: no, pmichaud changed rakudo so it compiles = down to an opcode, not to a dispatch to &infix:<=>

[16:45] <TimToady> like the = in a list constant doesn't flatten, and probably should

[17:28] <masak> TimToady: does it make sense for a nested class to implicitly trust its outer class? or does it only make sense in Java/C# ?

[17:29] *** molaf left
[17:29] *** wamba joined
[17:32] <TimToady> hmm, offhand I'd say it makes more sense for the outer class to trust its inner class

[17:32] <gfldex> does augment work on nested classes?

[17:32] <TimToady> why wouldn't it?

[17:32] <TimToady> a class is just a class on that level

[17:32] <TimToady> nestedness is merely its location

[17:33] <gfldex> so the outer class could augment the inner class at runtime with a method to get what it wants anyway

[17:34] <TimToady> well, only if you use MONKEY_TYPING

[17:35] <TimToady> .oO(Planet of the Monkeys...)

[17:35] * pmichaud notes the interesting contradiction in S32/Str.pod lines 207 and 530-535.  :-)

[17:35] <gfldex> there was little trust on that planet IIRC

[17:35] <TimToady> I suppose role composition could be considered "ape" typing

[17:36] *** jaldhar left
[17:37] <masak> role composition is at least "primate" typing.

[17:38] <TBA2> masak: what do you mean by implicit trust in java/c#? afaik all classes (in .net at least) regardless of nesting are subject to the same modifiers (so private in a nested class still means private to the outer class), even when inheriting (since only protected members are available to subclasses), and protected only applies to inheritance, not plain nested calsses

[17:38] <TBA2> s/calsses/classes/

[17:38] <masak> TimToady: my use case is the Memento pattern, in which a nested class has the responsibility of freezing/thawing its outer class. instances of the nested class can then be passed around without breaking encapsulation/data hiding.

[17:39] <masak> TBA2: hold on, I'll get you the code I was looking at.

[17:39] *** apejens joined
[17:39] <masak> TBA2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern

[17:40] <gfldex> TBA2: is the outer class would not trust it's nested classes by default you would have to set it as friend. IIRC that was not possible with all compiles before the outer class was declared completely (had it's closing '}').

[17:40] *** kanishka joined
[17:40] <masak> TBA2: the outer class calls the nested class's private methods.

[17:40] <masak> TBA2: I'm assuming only it can do that.

[17:40] <gfldex> you need that to have fast iterators

[17:40] *** araujo left
[17:41] <TBA2> afaik thats not possible in .net, perhaps only a java thing?

[17:41] *** araujo joined
[17:41] <TBA2> personally seems odd to me, private should mean private, always

[17:41] <masak> unless there's a trusts relation.

[17:42] <TBA2> yes, of course, but should that be default?

[17:42] <masak> that's what I'm asking.

[17:42] <TBA2> imho if someone wants the outer class to access it, then they'll declare it as such

[17:43] <masak> yes, half of me agrees :)

[17:43] <TBA2> could get confusing for everyone if people can (easily) start messing with the internals of another class

[17:43] <gfldex> it's a special case

[17:43] <gfldex> a nested class is quite close to the heart of it's mommy

[17:43] <masak> exactly.

[17:44] <masak> the same person is always the author of both.

[17:44] <TBA2> not necessarily though, they can be logically nested without being directly related

[17:44] <gfldex> well, what are nested classes for in perl6?

[17:44] <gfldex> or better, what does it mean to be nested?

[17:47] <masak> right now it doesn't mean anything, much.

[17:47] <TBA2> that there's a logical relationship between the two? e.g. in classes representing just a car, it might be decided to put 'SteeringWheel', 'Seat', 'Ashtray' etc inside the Car class, since that makes logical sense, however none of those things are directly related to the 'Car' class

[17:47] <masak> only ordinary lexical nesting, so it can see outer variables.

[17:47] <masak> but not instances of the surrounding class or anything like that.

[17:48] *** lue left
[17:48] <TBA2> but nested classes for the most part don't achieve much (even in .Net), unless the purpose is to hide a class from the outside world (e.g., a private class nested inside another class is never visible to anyone outside the outer class)

[17:49] *** wamba left
[17:49] *** wamba joined
[17:49] <masak> we can do that with 'my' classes, I guess. but then we still can't pass instances outside, because then others can call methods on it.

[17:49] *** lue joined
[17:50] <TBA2> is it really necessary to hide inner classes in perl anyway? has some (minor) benefits where only the compiled code is distributed, but where the source is regularly distributed it makes very little difference since it can be changed

[17:50] <gfldex> if you dont give the nested class special rights, the outer class become redundant to a namespace

[17:51] <TBA2> gfldex: good point, and thats what makes them virtually useless in other languages too, except for logical organisation :)

[17:52] <gfldex> it's quite useful in c++

[17:52] <TBA2> what do they do there? (not a c++ programmer in the slightest, can compile it and kinda debug it but thats about it lol)

[17:53] <gfldex> you can reuse sane names, mostly for iterators and therefor use a naming convention

[17:53] <TBA2> doesnt that come back to semantics and organisation though?

[17:54] <gfldex> so you end up with a individual type for each iterator and the compiler can slap you if you try to use A::iterator on class B

[17:55] <gfldex> on top of that c++ will optimise a lot of stuff away on nested classes because their are friend by default

[17:56] <masak> it's nice to hear you discuss a lot of points I've been thinking about in the last few days :)

[17:56] <gfldex> so masak question might even best be asked to the cunning idividual that is writing the optimiser :)

[17:56] <TBA2> does it do the same optimisation if the class isn't nested but are marked friend?

[17:56] <TBA2> (or can't it be?)

[17:56] <gfldex> i believe so

[17:57] <gfldex> well it's more looking for the const in 'void foo() const {}' anyway

[17:57] <TBA2> so nesting them simply enables friend, and allows some compiler safety checks?

[17:57] <masak> it bears repeating: in Perl 6 currently, a nested class isn't special in any way besides being located spatially instide another class.

[17:58] *** jaldhar joined
[17:58] <TBA2> masak: i'm thinking thats how it should be in P6, since nested doesn't define any relationship between the two, except on a logical basis

[17:58] <gfldex> TBA2: it allowes the compiler to _drop_ safety checks

[17:58] <TBA2> ahh, i see

[17:59] <gfldex> and that may be desireable for perl6 aswell

[17:59] <gfldex> if you compile iterator down in c++ you end up with bare pointer arithmetic

[18:00] <gfldex> and that's where quite a bit of it's speed comes from

[18:00] <gfldex> as less you do as faster you get :)

[18:00] <gfldex> *meep* *meep*

[18:00] <TBA2> lol, well i think you might be right about this being a question for the optimiser :)

[18:01] <gfldex> maybe somebody can promise jnthn some beer to make him read the above?

[18:06] <moritz> gfldex: you can

[18:09] <lichtkind> pmichaud: when parrot has 6model built, you will change rakudo?

[18:09] <pmichaud> lichtkind: I don't understand the question

[18:10] <lichtkind> i hear that frequently :)

[18:10] <pmichaud> it's the "change rakudo" part that confuses me, I think.  change it to what?

[18:11] <tadzik> to yapsi

[18:11] <pmichaud> or change it how?

[18:11] <lichtkind> pmichaud: parrot devs plan to adopt the 6model into core, when that is implemented, how that would change rakudo

[18:11] <moritz> lichtkind: rakudo will continue to use nqp. If parrot implements 6model, it will be a nqp change to adopt

[18:11] <pmichaud> it might make it faster.  other than that, I don't think it'll change much -- we're already using 6model in the 'nom' branch of rakudo (which we expect to become the new mainline trunk soon)

[18:11] <lichtkind> pmichaud: or could you then put some parts out of rakudo

[18:13] <lichtkind> pmichaud: thatswhy i asked, i thought when they provied then everything you could sorta drop it but on the other hand for a .net port you need it anyway

[18:13] <pmichaud> nqp is going to be the layer where we map rakudo needs to our backends

[18:13] *** envi left
[18:13] <lichtkind> makes sense

[18:14] <lichtkind> so you have a nom version of NQP too?

[18:14] <pmichaud> right now there's "nqp" and "nqp-rx"

[18:14] <pmichaud> nqp-rx is the version created in 2009, that is bundled with parrot and that rakudo master uses

[18:14] <pmichaud> nqp is the version created in 2011, that runs 6model and that rakudo-nom uses

[18:15] <pmichaud> nqp is the version we expect to be using and maintaining going forward

[18:15] <pmichaud> when (if?) parrot adopts 6model, then that will simply make it easier to implement nqp.

[18:16] <lichtkind> pmichaud: so that would just make the nqp version of parrot slim

[18:16] <lichtkind> thank you very much

[18:16] *** cognominal_ left

[18:25] <sjn> oh nixe

[18:25] <sjn> nice*

[18:26] <masak> used to be X~X at one point, to mirror [~] and >>~<<, I guess.

[18:26] <masak> I'm glad it changed. :)

[18:31] <pmichaud> well, it'd likely be   band_i  and band_s

[18:31] <pmichaud> I agree they don't deserve much huffmanization.  as of yet I'm wondering if they deserve a place in the opcode set at all.

[18:31] <pmichaud> (which is why I haven't done them yet)

[18:32] <pmichaud> could also be "bitand_i"  or  "bwand_i"  ('bw' == 'bitwise')

[18:32] <pmichaud> then instead of 'shl' we have 'bitshiftleft'  or 'bshiftl' or 'bshiftleft' or somesuch

[18:34] <sjn> btw, is there a "File" type?

[18:34] <masak> sjn: IO

[18:34] <pmichaud> the other nice thing about the nqp:: namespace is that we aren't committed to a name -- if we decide something should be renamed, we can just add a new mapping for the new name and then slowly migrate over the old usages

[18:35] <sjn> ok, so I can write a sub MAIN(IO $infile, IO :$outfile) { ... }

[18:35] <masak> sjn: well...

[18:35] <sjn> :)

[18:35] <masak> sjn: everything that comes in as MAIN parameters is a Str.

[19:11] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Bump NQP_REVISION to get new nqp:: opcode definitions (and reduce

[19:11] <dalek> rakudo/nom: the number of definitions needed in src/Perl6/Actions.pm).

[19:11] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a3b692d721

[19:12] <TBA2> we cant enforce it just by making it private in the same way java can (hence the discussion we had earlier  i assume?), but could we look at the caller and make sure its an Originator?

[19:12] * TBA2 consults the synopsis

[19:12] <TBA2> (after making a cup of tea :p)

[19:12] <masak> that's an original idea. :)

[19:13] <masak> if I derived from Originator, would the deriving class then be able to call Memento.getSavedState? probably not a good idea if it could.

[19:14] <TBA2> presumably we'd want it not to, hence hiding the data, so we need to know if its 100% definitely that type, not just if its that type or a subclass

[19:14] * TBA2 seems to have the word 'hence' stuck in his head

[19:15] *** ChrisDennis left
[19:16] *** jevin joined
[19:16] <TBA2> what happens in the java pattern? can subclasses of the originator see the data or only the originator? i assume only the originator, that would be protected otherwise?

[19:19] <gfldex> one could use introspection to build the nested class Memento and augment Originator by that nested class

[19:19] *** pochi left
[19:19] <gfldex> at least if all private members have state

[19:19] *** pochi joined
[19:21] <TBA2> if people can augment classes, couldn't they simply augment originator to get the nested memento and even augment the memento to retrieve the data?

[19:21] <gfldex> they could

[19:21] <gfldex> but if you like you can have with a shotgun to keep them away

[19:21] <gfldex> s/have/wave/

[19:21] <TBA2> lol

[19:22] <TBA2> im just thinking if we can augment the class, why bother trying to hide anything in the first place?

[19:22] <gfldex> and you can use a role to stick sateTomemento and restoreFromMemento into the class

[19:28] <TBA2> i take it caller() isn't implemented in rakudo yet?

[19:28] <moritz> right

[19:28] <TBA2> any way to get similar info by calling parrot?

[19:28] <moritz> or... not sure. But callframe() is implemented in master

[19:29] <moritz> rakudo: say callframe().file

[19:29] <p6eval> rakudo 7175e5: OUTPUT¬´/tmp/Za_yKdAbsS‚ê§¬ª

[19:29] <moritz> rakudo: say callframe(1).file

[19:29] <p6eval> rakudo 7175e5: OUTPUT¬´Any()‚ê§¬ª

[19:31] <TBA2> not sure callframe will help :(

[19:32] <moritz> TBA2: what do you need?

[19:33] <TBA2> thinking about it im not really sure lol, was hoping the name of the class which owns the sub that made the call

[19:33] <TBA2> i suppose something like p5's ref($obj) =~ m/ObjectType/

[19:33] <moritz> don't

[19:35] <moritz> if you want it for debugging, use $obj.WHAT

[19:35] <TBA2> in what way dont? :) im not sure itd have worked anyway, it could be easily fooled

[19:35] <moritz> if you want it for type checks, use ~~ or isa or does

[19:35] <TBA2> the problem is, without knowing who the caller is, we cant do any type checks anyway?

[19:36] <sjn> how does one prepend a string to every element in an array?

[19:36] <sorear> for @array { $_ = $string ~ $_ }

[19:36] <sorear> @array = $string X~ @array

[19:37] <sorear> @array = $string ¬ª~¬´ @array

[19:37] <TBA2> sorear: what happened to the BSCINABTE bit? ;)

[19:39] <TBA2> moritz: dont really know enough about rakudo yet, but im not sure that the entire pattern can be implemented properly as it is, not without some major trickery going on, which would be rather pointless anyway :)

[20:08] <sjn> how does one do secondary sorts?

[20:08] <sjn> e.g. first by length of a string, then alphabetically

[20:09] <moritz> two options:

[20:09] <masak> @a.sort(&alpha).sort(+ *.chars)

[20:09] <moritz> what is &alpha?

[20:10] <masak> er. I cheated.

[20:10] <moritz> just use @a.sort.sort(*.chars)

[20:10] <masak> oh, troo.

[20:10] <masak> or .sort(*.Str)

[20:10] <moritz> second option: @a.sort: { $a.chars <=> $b.chars || $a leg $b }

[20:10] <sjn> sort(*.chars | *.Str)

[20:11] <masak> doesn't guarantee ordering.

[20:11] <sjn> right

[20:11] <masak> junctions are inherently unordered.

[20:11] <masak> and you want the order.

[20:12] <sjn> mm

[20:12] <masak> not sure how the above would behave, actually.

[20:12] * sjn remembers

[20:12] <masak> rakudo: my @a = "foo", "foo_long", "bar", "gah", "gafz"; .say for @a.sort( *.chars | *.Str )

[20:12] <p6eval> rakudo 7175e5: OUTPUT¬´any("foo", "bar", "gah", "gafz", "foo_long")‚ê§¬ª

[20:13] <masak> seems to sort on length only in Rakudo.

[20:13] <masak> not immediately sure why.

[20:13] <moritz> well, it returns a junction

[20:13] <moritz> and that is unordered

[20:13] <masak> guess that could be explanation enough, yes.

[20:14] <moritz> ah well

[20:14] <masak> thinking about that junction threading through the sorting algorithm makes my head hurt a little, though :)

[20:14] <masak> junctions are a bit dangerous.

[20:15] <moritz> the sort does the equivalent of  { ($^a.chars | $^a.Str) cmp ($^b.chars | $^b.Str) }

[20:15] <masak> right.

[20:15] <masak> which might well be any(True, False)

[20:15] <moritz> right

[20:15] <masak> which boolifies to True.

[20:15] <moritz> but

[20:15] <moritz> the algorithm will do something like

[20:16] <moritz> if $result == -1 { ... } elsif $result == 1 { ... } else { ... }

[20:16] <masak> oh right.

[20:16] <masak> cmp gives any(-1, 0, 1)

[20:16] <moritz> and since $result will likely boild down to any(1, -1, 0)  or so

[20:16] <moritz> it depends on the internal ordering of the branches

[20:16] <masak> aye

[20:20] <masak> hm, Rakudo has ChangeLog and release announcements going back to 2009, but git logs going back all the way to 2006.

[20:20] <moritz> masak: that's because in parrot times it didn't have separate releases

[20:20] <masak> ah, yes.

[20:21] <moritz> masak: but the revision history for languages/perl6/ was imported into the rakudo git repo

[20:21] <masak> git++

[20:21] * masak makes a "highlights" summary of Rakudo's history since 2006

[20:22] <masak> so 2009-02 marks "Rakudo detached from Parrot repo" :)

[20:22] <masak> moritz: oh btw, congratulations on becoming Rakudo-Parrot spokesperson.

[20:27] <masak> five years ago, and then some.

[20:28] <TimToady> since then it's been turning into a teenager

[20:29] <masak> "Perl 6: now a teenager"

[20:29] <masak> that's a blog post in itself.

[20:29] <masak> actually, I'll use that in my first FPW talk on Sat ;)

[20:30] <masak> though after actually counting a bit... don't the teens begin at... 13? :)

[20:30] <masak> Perl 6 only turns 11 this year.

[20:30] <pmichaud> tell that to my daughter

[20:30] <masak> :P

[20:30] <pmichaud> she definitely started being a teenager before 13.

[20:30] <TimToady> "no longer almost a pre-teen..."

[20:31] <huf> soon it'll be legal?

[20:31] <huf> oy vey

[20:32] <masak> I'm sure Perl 6 will be a very responsible youth.

[20:32] <masak> wow, 'infix:-' looks so ugly nowadays... :)

[20:32] <huf> depends on the circle of friends

[20:33] <huf> it's very hard to go against peer pressure when you're a t een

[20:34] <masak> I'd say 2006-04-14 marks the "birth" of Rakudo. at least according to the story told my the logs. so much activity that day. pmichaud++

[21:23] <masak> pmichaud: I'm not out to do that at all. I want to show the progress that's happened in the past two-three years.

[21:23] <masak> but yes, inherent in that is a lot of rewrites. but I don't think that's embarrassing.

[21:24] <dalek> evalbot: be41d10 | sorear++ | lib/EvalbotExecuter.pm:

[21:24] <dalek> evalbot: Tweak orphan avoidance again; take revision strings into account.

[21:24] <dalek> evalbot: review: https://github.com/perl6/evalbot/commit/be41d10fc7

[21:24] <pmichaud> masak: thus the half-smiley.  your talks are uniformly excellent, and humorous, and fun, and often contain a comment or two at my expense (which I actually enjoy also)

[21:24] <sorear> lots of rewrites, sure, but I don't think the actual semantics have changed much at all in the last year

[21:24] <pmichaud> well, except for lists and iterators.  :)

[21:24] <pmichaud> and stringy.

[21:24] <jnthn> and multis.

[21:24] <sorear> yes, masak++'s sense of humor is second to none

[21:25] <masak> pmichaud: thanks for the kind words. I've never intentionally set out to put you or any other Rakudo dev in a tight spot.

[21:25] <pmichaud> masak: it's probably not coming across well, but any worry I have is mostly feigned.  :)

[21:25] *** kanishka left
[21:25] <masak> I suspected that :)

[21:25] <pmichaud> oh, and we changed the meaning of   the ? quantifier in regexes

[21:26] <masak> twice.

[21:26] <jnthn> pmichaud: Did we catch up with that change in Rakudo/nqp yet?

[21:26] <pmichaud> jnthn: not yet.  we should do that soon.

[21:26] <masak> or maybe we just thought about it the second time...

[21:26] <jnthn> pmichaud: We could always wiat for it to change a third time. :P

[21:26] <pmichaud> masak: yes, it's changed twice

[21:26] <PerlJam> The meaning of ? didn't change ... just the results  ;)

[21:26] <tadzik> hello, the herd

[21:26] <pmichaud> meaning == results to me :)

[21:27] <masak> it starts implementing junctions. way to dive into a project, jnthn! :)

[21:28] <masak> back then, .eigenstates was called, .values

[21:28] <pmichaud> oh, and we keep changing the meaning of booleans, too :)

[21:28] <tadzik> my LUG group thinks writing a C compiler is close to insanity and undoable during the summer. I'm now both confused and motivated

[21:28] <pmichaud> or at least the boolean API

[21:28] <masak> pmichaud: "But what is truth?" :P

[21:28] <pmichaud> 42!

[21:28] <jnthn> masak: You do know the reason I ended up in Rakudo is because I drank a load of beer at Oscon and then told Pm I'd implement Junctions? :)

[21:28] <pmichaud> answer comes tomorrow!

[21:29] <lichtkind> thou: next paste comes soon

[21:29] <masak> jnthn: yes, I've heard the story :)

[21:29] <pmichaud> rakudo (and Perl 6) as we know it doesn't exist without alcohol

[21:29] <lichtkind> jnthn: sounds plausible :)

[21:29] <jnthn> What I didn't realize was the dependencies doing junctions implied :)

[21:30] <pmichaud> afk for a bit

[21:30] <pmichaud> oh, before I go

[21:30] <PerlJam> jnthn: the rest of rakudo?  :)

[21:30] <masak> could someone write a working example of TimToady's idea at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2011-06-22#i_3984668 ? I loosely understand it, but can't make it solidify in my mind into actual code.

[21:30] <pmichaud> I should mention that I now consider rakudo to be an "official" Perl 6 compiler.  :)

[21:30] <masak> (kthxbai)

[21:30] <pmichaud> (have for several months, in fact)

[21:30] <PerlJam> pmichaud: you need to make a prominent public announcement about it though  :)

[21:30] <jnthn> Like Yapsi! \o/

[21:31] <pmichaud> yes, so yapsi is no longer the only one.  :)

[21:31] <masak> yeah ywah, join the club.

[21:31] <masak> now you only have to be a complete implementation, too :P

[21:32] <TimToady> niecza: my @array = <a b c>, <d e f>; say @array[1]

[21:32] <masak> :P

[21:32] <jnthn> masak: There's also one where I mis-spelt Rakudo. :P

[21:32] <sorear> I should join a LUG

[21:32] <masak> it hasn't changed name yet.

[21:33] <sorear> TimToady: yeah.

[21:33] <jnthn> masak: I didn't learn the new name properly before using it in a commit message :P

[21:33] <sorear> TimToady: I'm not sure what the semantics should be though

[21:33] <masak> jnthn: I understand, it's not that easy.

[21:33] <moritz> it should be consistent :-)

[21:33] <TimToady> sorear: I had to sprinkel some .flats into http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Number_names#Perl_6 because of that

[21:33] <TimToady> *kle

[21:34] <sorear> TimToady: yeah, I saw.

[21:34] <tadzik> ooh, YAPC::EU schedule

[21:34] <sorear> TimToady: what were you trying to do with .comb(/(\d) ** 1..3/) ?

[21:34] <masak> New Year's Eve 2007: jnthn++ implements the 'given' statement :)

[21:35] <PerlJam> masak: as long as you're perusing history, it might be an interesting trek to see all of the parrot commits that were a result of changes to rakudo and vice-versa

[21:35] <TimToady> trying to bind it to -> $i, $x, $c {...}

[21:35] <TimToady> on a reversed string of digits

[21:35] <lichtkind> TimToady: sometimes i think the origin of the word perl was a simple pun involving the word shell :)

[21:35] <PerlJam> s/were a result/were a direct result/

[21:35] <TimToady> well, $i, $x?, $c?

[21:35] <sorear> TimToady: I thought .comb returned only strings, not matches

[21:35] <masak> PerlJam: urgh. this bit of research is already to big... :)

[21:35] * sorear checks S32 again

[21:35] <PerlJam> masak: file it away for the next one then :)

[21:35] <TimToady> oh, I think you're right

[21:36] <TimToady> lemme try it with .match

[21:36] <sorear> hmm, I wonder if just .comb would do what you want

[21:36] <sorear> .comb -> $i, $x?, $c?

[21:36] <TimToady> I thought I tried that one

[21:37] <sorear> I wouldn't be suprised if "for" with optional parameters is broken in niecza.

[21:48] <tadzik> } masak { should parse as "hugme: hug masak"

[21:48] <masak> TBA2: wait, was that an invitation, or just a query for clarification? :P

[21:49] <TBA2> masak: you decide

[21:49] * masak deftly changes the subject

[21:49] <masak> it's raining here.

[21:49] <TBA2> its always raining here lol

[21:50] <masak> TBA2: are you in a rainforest?

[21:50] <TBA2> rain is good for programming

[21:50] <TBA2> no, Wales lol

[21:50] <masak> :)

[21:50] <TBA2> i think its actually wetter here than the Amazon in rainy season

[21:51] <masak> back in 2008, we had a class called Object.

[21:51] <masak> those were the days.

[21:54] * TBA2 likes S17... a lot!

[21:55] <masak> it's one of the fairly liquid ones.

[21:55] <TBA2> if it can be kept roughly as it is, it'll be a massive improvement to threading compared to almost every other language i've used

[21:56] <TBA2> perl5's ithreads and .net threading are a nightmare, S17 makes it looks extremely neat (and easy to follow)

[21:56] <sorear> wait, really?

[21:56] <sorear> I couldn't understand S17 so I implemented .net threading instead

[21:56] <masak> I'm surprised, too.

[21:57] <TBA2> perhaps i just have more experience with threading than i ever cared for lol

[21:57] <TBA2> :/

[21:57] * diakopter waits for jnthn to chime in

[21:57] <sorear> if you understand S17, perhaps you could explain it to me. :/

[21:57] <TBA2> also been doing a lot with threading in p5 the last few weeks

[21:57] <masak> most of S17 looks like blue-sky ruminations.

[21:57] <TBA2> lol, not sure i could explain it in terms of a compiler implementation :p but so far as being understandable and usable, it looks pretty good to me lol

[21:58] <masak> diakopter: jnthn's asleep, and won't chime until the morning :)

[21:58] <PerlJam> TBA2: even the signal stuff?

[21:58] <diakopter> oh

[21:59] <lichtkind> tadzik: so you dont know of any modules you would recommend, even as good coding practice?

[22:01] <TBA2> PerlJam: reasonably yeah, well, it seems a hell of a lot better than the way p5 does it

[22:01] <tadzik> lichtkind: good coding practice, to read?

[22:01] <lichtkind> tadzik: yes

[22:02] <lichtkind> lichtkind: but practical modules would also be important

[22:03] <TBA2> sorear: what is it you didnt like about S17?

[22:03] <tadzik> most of them are good :) ABC, JSON, Web.pm has lots of good code

[22:03] <TBA2> masak: do you think S17 should change, or will need to?

[22:03] <tadzik> URI gets better and better recently

[22:04] <sorear> TBA2: I just read it and I'm confused about what exactly is critical means

[22:04] <masak> TBA2: just skimming it makes alarm bells go off in my head.

[22:04] <tadzik> Druid is very nice too

[22:04] <masak> tadzik: it was the first OO project I wrote in Perl 6 :) long ago, back in 2008.

[22:05] <TBA2> sorear: the way i read it is, if you mark something as 'is critical', that will never be interrupted during execution (and neither will anything thats called from it). if theres any interruptions, they wait until the 'is critical' block has ended

[22:05] <sorear> TBA2: what if there are more than one thread?

[22:05] <TBA2> presumably they get stored on the signals queue

[22:05] <TBA2> sorear: what type of threads? OS threads or Perl6 'threads'?

[22:05] * masak finally reaches a point of information overload

[22:06] <TBA2> the only risk i see with is critical would be the 'and stuff called from it' bit, could potentially leave an entire program as uninterruptable

[22:06] <sorear> this is 2011.  Perl 6 threads have to be able to take advantage of people's 48-core MacBooks

[22:07] <sorear> yapsi: say 5

[22:25] <lichtkind> what was the new regex feature that largely drove the ng branch?

[22:28] <sorear> lichtkind: protoregexes

[22:28] <lichtkind> thank you

[22:28] <sorear> they require a tight integration between the regex engine and the OO system to work

[22:29] <lichtkind> and is it possible to get 100% of rakudo written in NQP?

[22:29] <sorear> pre-ng, our regex engine was completely separate from almost everything else

[22:29] <sorear> yes

[22:29] <lichtkind> but were not yet there?

[22:29] <sorear> we're very close

[22:29] <sorear> well

[22:29] <sorear> we're sort of cheating

[22:30] <lichtkind> :)

[22:30] <sorear> a lot of the C and all of the PIR that was in Rakudo has been moved to NQP

[22:44] *** pjcj joined
[22:49] *** TBA2_mobi joined
[22:54] <TBA2_mobi> sorear: just wanted to add, to implement something like is critical in .net IL you'd need to hook into windows messaging to absorb any messages (signals) your compiler gets, that way you can ignore them or pass them on to the perl code. Not sure how that would work in terms of mono, but in windows it should be (reasonably) straightforward windows api calls to intercept the messages before .net framework takes its default actions

[22:55] *** jferrero left
[23:00] <sorear> TBA2_mobi: what if there is more than one OS thread?  does is critical need to grab the GIL?

[23:06] <AndroUser2> Terrible connection lol

[23:06] <AndroUser2> Its tba2 btw, damn android irc lol

[23:08] <AndroUser2> You'll need to queue any messages until the perl code has exited all of the critical blocks, then presumably release them in the same order, should seem invisible to perl

[23:10] <AndroUser2> Also, if perl programmers shouldnt have to care about the underlying os, then perhaps all signals/messages should be captured and verified before they reach perl. Would come with a performance penalty thoufh
