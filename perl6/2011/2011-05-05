[09:16] <jnthn> Yeah, I hate it when Java builds things

[09:17] <mathw> although it's not actually anything to do with Java as it turns out, it's extremely poor use of various Java-related build tools which have together created a mass capable of generating enough frustration to power central London for nearly four seconds

[09:22] <mathw> there's XML involved, as it uses ant scripts

[09:22] <mathw> a bizarrely large number of them

[09:22] <mathw> the overall impression is of something massively overengineered, but without any kind of coherent vision

[09:22] <mathw> oh and it doesn't work either

[09:26] <arnsholt> An excellent excuse to blow it all away and do something that works, then =)

[09:27] <arnsholt> Maybe replace ant with make =)

[09:27] <mathw> that's the plan... I'm going to try to persuade my boss to give me some time for it

[11:35] <tadzik> so in the actual day we rush to the embassy asking for guidance

[11:35] <tadzik> turns out they can't give us our visas for today, but there's this tourist agency on the other side of the street, and they're able to get us visas in a few hours time

[11:36] <jnthn> Heh

[11:36] <jnthn> They had a "special relationship" with the embassy, huh? :)

[11:50] <bbkr_> if not - how can I check in runtime if ICU is loaded?

[11:51] <tadzik> bbkr_: I don't think that is supported. You can a) create a Configure.pl that will check that before building and complain, b) file a ticket for perl6/ecosystem for META.info to support things like that

[11:51] <tadzik> preferably both

[11:51] <tadzik> although I think I forgot to implement Configure.pl in panda, and I don't think I want to

[12:27] <Jdoneright> Perl even can be "J done right"

[12:31] <Jdoneright> Perl already looks like J when you do "map sort grep" thing.

[12:33] <Jdoneright> Well, J does not have cycles.

[12:35] <Jdoneright> Serious drawback with J is, you can't learn it fast. Its keywords are calculator-like -- one or two punctuation symbols.

[12:35] <Jdoneright> Yes.

[12:37] <mathw> Jdoneright: So, what specifically could Perl 6 learn from J?

[12:37] <Jdoneright> The idea behind J is, lets think of a program as chain of operations which makes output list from input list, and then lets code this chain from standard operations. Much like map-sort-map paradigm.

[12:38] <mathw> so, the feed operators then

[12:38] <mathw> we can do that

[12:38] <jnthn> rakudo: (-1,2,5) ==> map * + 2 ==> grep * > 1 ==> say

[12:39] <mathw> that's more like it :)

[12:40] <Jdoneright> J uses grammar-related terms: "noun", "verb", "adverb"

[12:40] <mathw> so what does its standard library have that Perl 6's setting doesn't and should have?

[12:41] <Jdoneright> That should be answered after doing needed research work.

[12:42] <Jdoneright> Concept of adverbs is another example. Those ase operations which modify operations.

[12:44] <mathw> Are they able to do this without the operation explicitly supporting particular adverbs?

[12:44] *** envi_ joined
[12:44] <Jdoneright> Well, as I see it, J benefits greatly from its unified approach to data. All data there is array(list) of some dimensions.

[12:44] <mathw> or are they just parameters to that operation

[12:46] <bbkr_> star: use MIME::Base64; MIME::Base64.encode_base64('zażółć gęślą jaźń'); # ooops :) any idea for workaround?

[12:46] <Jdoneright> mathw, they look like parameters, but they are universal and very orthgonal. For example, adverb "/" means "insert that op between items of list"

[12:53] <bbkr_> tadzik: I'm analyzing this module right now. And to be honest I don't think it's parrot bug. Base 64 RFC does not specify how to handle unicode, so it's natural for method to expect something like Buf, not multibyte characters.

[13:29] <bbkr_> tadzik: I've re-read RFC and i'm sure it's not parrot bug. base64 should expect only ascii characters. unicode should be repacked into separate characters, something like [~]'zażółć'.encode>>.chr

[14:48] <tadzik> LTA, I must say :)

[14:50] <bbkr_> I still claim that it is MIME::Base64 bug. encode_base64 in parrot follows RFC spec and expects string composed of ASCII characters. It's Perl6 that must mangle unicode to be DWIM-y :)

[14:50] *** spetrea left
[14:51] <bbkr_> tadzik: P5 base64 behaves the same way - you have to encode manually. which is awful to debug.

[14:51] <sorear> observation: in Perl 5, substr($long, $big, 1) = $char is O(1)

[14:52] * bbkr_ is back to Email::MIME hacking

[14:52] <tadzik> bbkr_: I see

[14:52] <flussence> does p6 have a concept of "default encoding" that Str.encode could use to simplify the base64 thing?

[14:52] <moritz> sorear: even for strings with UTF8 flag?

[14:52] * sorear wonders if the same can/should be true in Perl 6

[14:52] <sorear> moritz: no

[14:52] <moritz> flussence: it has, otherwise you'd have to write Str.encode("UTF-8")

[14:53] <moritz> the questions is really if MIME::Base64 should do it automatically for you

[14:54] <flussence> I'm of the opinion it should, and anyone wanting a different encoding should call .encode themselves...

[14:54] <bbkr_> moritz: IMO it should. every library in other languages and every converter does it automatically. I simply do not care about internals when I want to encode 'żółty'

[14:55] <moritz> bbkr_: you do not want to care, but you should, because there's not one standard way

[14:55] *** am0c left
[14:55] <moritz> base64 really is a format for encoding octets in ascii

[14:56] <sorear> moritz: does it always default to UTF-8, or to nl_langinfo(CHARSET)?

[14:56] <moritz> not for encoding text in ascii

[14:56] *** hercynium joined
[14:56] <moritz> sorear: dunno

[15:01] <Juerd> bbkr_: Base64 encoding encodes a string of *bytes* (not necessarily ASCII) to a string of ASCII characters.

[15:02] <Juerd> bbkr_: There's no Unicode involved *at all*. If you have Unicode somewhere, you must first encode it. This could be done transparently but it still needs to be done.

[15:02] * bbkr_ agrees now

[15:03] <Juerd> In Perl 5, encode_base64 should try to downgrade its argument. If that fails, it should at the very least emit a warning.

[15:03] <Juerd> I don't know if it's actually implemented like that.

[15:09] *** am0c joined

[18:20] <Moukeddar> hello masak 

[18:20] <Moukeddar> my Hero

[18:20] <masak> oh, knock it off. :P you know I can't handle flattery :)

[18:20] <Moukeddar> that CQRS is very Enterprisy :)

[18:20] <Moukeddar> i feel Corporatish

[18:20] <masak> Moukeddar: if you ask for me and it's 2 am here, I might not reply immediately. :)

[18:20] <Moukeddar> oh

[18:21] <Moukeddar> where's that?

[18:21] <Moukeddar> Sweden?

[18:21] <masak> yeah.

[18:21] <masak> Moukeddar: well, the "enterprisey" setting is a very common one.

[18:21] <Moukeddar> masak, today i asked a teacher about the CQRS and the DDD

[18:21] <Moukeddar> he said 

[18:21] <Moukeddar> what's that

[18:21] <Moukeddar> lol

[18:21] <masak> that doesn't surprise me.

[18:22] <masak> it's not common knowledge.

[18:22] <Moukeddar> he's an engineer :)

[18:23] <masak> right. the good news hasn't reached everyone yet.

[18:23] <masak> either that, or it's just a fad, and we're all high on the bubble. :)

[18:23] <Moukeddar> who knows

[18:24] <Moukeddar> but it's fun to learn that :)

[18:24] <Moukeddar> spetrea, it's official ?

[18:24] <spetrea> well it's teh wikipedia page so .. I guess it's official

[18:24] <spetrea> I searched rakudo on facebook but found nothin

[18:24] <masak> it's the official wikipedia page.

[18:24] <spetrea> make a facebook thingie :)

[18:25] <Moukeddar> i like that i can like stuff i like

[18:25] <Su-Shee> there is a perl6 facebook thingie I think.

[18:36] <masak> it's a game server. it's written in Perl 5/Moose.

[18:36] <Moukeddar> how's it going ?

[18:44] <masak> did you read the post itself? :)

[18:44] <Moukeddar> Fight Club

[18:44] <Moukeddar> i'm reading

[18:44] <Moukeddar> why you didn't use a gamestart command?

[18:45] <masak> a good question.

[18:45] <Moukeddar> tha game automaticly starts when the two players join right ?

[18:45] *** lue left
[18:45] <masak> no, a game automatically starts when an Invitation is accepted.

[18:45] *** lue joined
[18:45] <masak> though you could see that as "two players joining", if you like.

[18:46] <masak> but it's more of a mutual agreement.

[18:46] <Moukeddar> ok , i see

[18:46] <Moukeddar> Domain expert talking :)

[18:46] <masak> yeah, I've seen about four such game servers at very close range. I know what I want from them. :)

[18:47] <jnthn> Sadly, his architect was utterly incompetent. :)

[18:47] <masak> don't listen to jnthn!

[18:47] <jnthn> :P

[18:47] <masak> the client tells me he was very impressed with the architect... :)

[18:48] <Moukeddar> the clients are sometimes confused and don't know what they want

[18:53] <Moukeddar> right?

[18:54] <Su-Shee> no it's not the same as bouncing off ideas, it's less errors, more merge of knowledge, more social control over cleansiness of code.. 

[18:54] <Moukeddar> indeed

[19:29] *** leprevost left
[19:30] <jnthn> It's the student version of trolling freelancer sites by posting projects that boil down to the halting problem.

[19:30] <Moukeddar> so sad

[19:30] <Moukeddar> i mean it's not that hard

[19:30] <moritz> the halting problem?

[19:31] <jnthn> moritz: There are some people on freelancing sites who will bid for ANYTHING.

[19:31] <Moukeddar> they should be burned alive with NAPALM for digracing the programming Race :p

[19:31] <jnthn> moritz: "I want a program that works out if other programs terminate." "Oh yes, we can make that for you!"

[19:31] <moritz> jnthn: I know, I've seen some of those examples

[19:32] <moritz> jnthn: some even claim "I've solved the same problem for a previous project"

[19:32] <jnthn> :D

[19:32] <Moukeddar> even if i did freelance , i can't recieve paiments

[19:32] <jnthn> Good way to weed out the people *not* to get to work on your project. :)

[19:32] <Moukeddar> :(

[19:32] <PerlJam> jnthn: indeed

[19:34] <PerlJam> HR here has a questionaire thingy where you can build a set of questions to ask candidates then rank them based on their answers.  One of the options is "immediately disqualify if they answer X"    I really liked that one.

[19:34] <Moukeddar> am i in danger ?

[19:34] <PerlJam> Moukeddar: you are always in danger.

[19:34] <TimToady> only if you answer X

[19:34] <Moukeddar> what if i answer  "i don't know "

[19:36] <moritz> that's often better than no answer at all

[19:37] <moritz> erm

[19:37] <moritz> I mean better than the totally wrong answer

[19:37] <moritz> or better than talking for minutes without answering the question

[19:37] <Moukeddar> i need to shut up more often

[19:38] <PerlJam> It's easy to weed out liars like that "How many years experience do you have with Perl 6?"  a) 1-5 b) 6-10  c) 11-15 d) > 15

[19:38] <Moukeddar> hehe

[19:38] <Moukeddar> since when perl6 is around

[19:38] <moritz> depends on what you mean by "around" :-)

[19:39] <PerlJam> anyone who answers c had better be named "Larry"  :)

[19:39] *** miso2217 joined
[19:39] <Moukeddar> perl6 is pretty young :)

[19:39] <sbp> hmm, I first mentioned perl6 on 2004-02-09 that I can find

[19:39] * moritz thinks he might be nearing his 5th year of Perl 6

[19:39] <sbp> from the same logs, a friend mentioned it on 2002-06-14

[19:41] *** fglock joined
[19:43] <TimToady> well, I can answer c if I can round to the nearest year...

[19:46] <TimToady> or d if you allow working on the prototype for Perl 6 :P

[20:04] <masak> [backlog] halting problem argument considered overused.

[20:04] <tadzik> jnthn, jnthn! Is blizkost dirived from "bliskość"? It just came to my head today

[20:04] *** alester joined
[20:04] <Moukeddar> hi masak 

[20:04] <masak> hi.

[20:04] <masak> some very fine, attackable problems boil down to the halting problem. and it's still very much worth it writing (partial) solutions to them.

[20:05] <Moukeddar> like freelance projects ;)

[20:05] <Moukeddar> i love trying to solve them

[20:05] <masak> by the way, I saw an excellent analogy the other day.

[20:05] <miso2217> tadzik: it is from the slovak "blizkost" what is "bliskość" in polish i think

[20:06] <jnthn> What miso2217 said, apart from I don't know hardly anything about Polish. But the Slovak bit is true. :)

[20:06] <miso2217> tadzik: with a few accents missing

[20:06] <masak> Euclid proved, somewhat against intuition, that there are an infinity of necessary "basic integers". we call them prime numbers.

[20:06] * PerlJam reframes the halting problem to guarantee haltingness.  :-)

[20:06] <masak> Gödel similarly proved that there are an infinity of necessary "basic axioms".

[20:06] <masak> I kinda like the symmetry there.

[20:06] <jnthn> miso2217: Som lenivy... ;)

[20:06] <Moukeddar> maths :p

[20:06] <miso2217> jnthn: Aj ja! :-)

[20:07] <tadzik> ść aren't accents, but I get it :)

[20:08] <miso2217> tadzik: I said accents, as I don't know how it should be called in english, How do you call that in english?

[20:08] <tadzik> miso2217: I don't :) They're just different letters

[20:08] <miso2217> tadzik: should be called some kind of accentuaion I think, no?

[20:08] *** stkowski joined
[20:09] <tadzik> nope

[20:09] <tadzik> for example, you prononcu ś "si", ć, "ci

[20:09] <tadzik> ", something like that

[20:10] <moritz> more generally speaking they are marks

[20:10] <moritz> or "combining characters"

[20:10] <miso2217> marks! that's it

[20:10] <tadzik> like u umlaut, hm?

[20:10] <moritz> right

[20:10] <tadzik> oh, the little things in letters

[20:10] <tadzik> they're "ogonki" :)

[20:11] *** fglock left
[20:11] <tadzik> "little tails" would be in english

[20:11] *** [Coke] left
[20:11] <jnthn> cute :)

[20:11] <miso2217> so there a few marks missing ont the "blizkost" to be the slovak blizkost, but as i have only french keyboard I can't easily write that correctly. I'll pase tit from google :-)
