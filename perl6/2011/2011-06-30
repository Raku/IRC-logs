[00:05] <thundergnat> Hmm. NYI  in Rakudo I guess.

[00:05] <perlhack> the correct answer is True

[00:05] <perlhack> hm....

[00:05] <perlhack> what mean "NYI"

[00:06] <donri> is perlhack trying to ask which country has the prettiest girls?

[00:06] <thundergnat> Interestingly there is an unfudged test for that in roast. I wonder how that passes...

[00:06] <thundergnat> perkhack: Not Yet Implemented

[00:06] <perlhack> Oh  i see

[00:06] <perlhack> prettiest girls

[00:07] <perlhack> i like it

[00:07] <perlhack> very like

[00:07] <perlhack> Hey Hey 

[00:08] <perlhack> thanks you all answered my question 

[00:08] <thundergnat> Ah. The reason would be because that test file isn't in the spectest.data file, so it never gets run.

[00:11] *** starcoder left
[00:13] <sorear> donri: I can't tell.

[00:13] <thundergnat> FWIW,  the file t/S05-metasyntax/litvar.t (https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S05-metasyntax/litvar.t) should probably be added to rakudo/t/spectest.data (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/t/spectest.data). I'd do it but I don't have a commit bit for Rakudo.

[00:13] <sorear> donri: I asked perlhack for the Chinese version but didn't get it.

[00:14] <thundergnat> Will need some fudging. Bunch of tests don't pass locally.

[00:14] <perlhack> Me ????

[00:14] <perlhack> ÂìàÂìà  Sometimes I don't understant you talk 

[00:15] <thundergnat> perlhack: I wasn't speaking to you in particular, just the perl6 channel in general.

[00:15] <sorear> perlhack: What is "16:40 < perlhack> Which country more than beauty?" in Chinese?

[00:16] <sorear> perlhack: and "Which country more than the pretty girl..."?

[00:16] <perlhack> Yes  

[00:16] <perlhack> prettitest girl ....

[00:16] <perlhack> ....

[00:17] <sorear> #perl6: How does qx/.../ know whether to return a list or a single string?

[00:17] <perlhack> The most prettiest girl 

[00:17] <flussence> qx can return a list? didn't know that.

[00:17] <donri> perlhack: sorear is asking you to say it in chinese

[00:20] <perlhack> why???

[00:20] <flussence> the spec doesn't say a lot about qx

[00:21] <perlhack> why cannot say with sorear?

[00:22] <perlhack> why not say Sorear?

[00:22] <sorear> I don't really pay attention.

[02:25] <sorear> TimToady: What is my @x = qx[ls] supposed to do?

[02:27] <TimToady> we don't have that kind of context now, so either it's automatically lines, or it's a slurp

[02:27] <TimToady> I don't see how we can have it both easily

[02:27] <sorear> which should it be, a slurp?

[02:28] <TimToady> if it's lines, there is the potential to be lazy

[02:28] <TimToady> so I'm inclined to call it lines, and if you assign to $x you get an arrayref

[02:33] <TimToady> well, yes, so?

[03:11] * colomon is excited about Cats, but probably just because he has never tried to actually implement them

[03:18] <TimToady> high ones tend to be steel

[03:34] <TimToady> well, mainly you have to extend the string by an relative size, not a fixed size

[03:35] <TimToady> that is, of course, a silly way to get a string of a million a's

[03:36] *** am0c left
[03:36] <TimToady> when 'a' x 1_000_000 can just pre-extend the whole thing

[04:46] *** cotto joined
[04:46] <pmichaud> It creates a Rakudo/Perl 6 Exception.

[04:46] <slavik1> so, rakudo doesn't use PERL6LIB?

[04:46] *** JimmyZ left
[04:48] <jnthn> pmichaud: Presumably that's calling repr_create?

[04:49] <pmichaud> jnthn: yes, exactly.

[04:49] <slavik1> question on blizkost, does it actually copy stuff to system wide directories?

[04:49] <jnthn> pmichaud: OK, good.

[04:49] <pmichaud> there's not an nqp:: opcode to create Parrot objects;  that's still the domain of pir::new

[04:50] * jnthn hopes nobody tries nqp::create('foo') :-)

[04:52] *** cotto left
[04:53] <jnthn> slavik1: My guess is that make install of blizkost copies to whatever installation paths your Parrot is using.

[04:53] <jnthn> slavik1: So if it's a "system wide" Parrot then it will. Otherwise, not.

[04:53] <slavik1> jnthn: because I don't want to run make install for rakudo

[04:53] <slavik1> ok, cool

[09:12] <phenny> moritz: I'll pass that on when pmichaud is around.

[09:12] <jnthn> Can probably be $!x there

[09:12] <jnthn> Generally, that's preferable to use 

[09:12] <jnthn> Not only because it's shorter but because it's more optimal

[09:13] <jnthn> er

[09:13] <jnthn> more optimizable

[09:15] * moritz replaces and tests

[09:15] <moritz> jnthn: if I try to throw X::Fancy exceptions from Actions.pm, does that mean I have to set up the exception classes in BOOTSTRAP.pm? or is that too late?

[09:16] <jnthn> moritz: The only time we'll hit "fun" doing that is when compiling the setting

[09:16] <jnthn> moritz: No, they don't want to go in BOOTSTRAP.pm

[09:16] <jnthn> moritz: Not least because setting a role up in there is horrible.

[09:17] <jnthn> moritz: Are they roles that we'll rely on punning?

[09:17] *** Mowah joined
[09:17] <moritz> jnthn: not sure yet

[09:17] <jnthn> moritz: OK

[09:17] <moritz> maybe not

[09:17] <jnthn> Anyway, from Actions.pm

[09:18] <jnthn> $*ST.find_symbol(['X', 'Fancy']) gets you the type object of the role/class/whatever.

[09:18] <moritz> cool

[09:18] <jnthn> You going to use these for parse/compile time errors?

[09:18] <moritz> so I can just nqp::die($*ST.find_symbol(['X', 'Comp']).new(...)) or so

[09:18] <jnthn> If so my suggestion is:

[09:19] <moritz> that's the plan, yes

[09:19] <jnthn> 1) Factor this out into some subroutine that finds and throws the appropriate exception

[09:19] <moritz> +1

[09:19] <jnthn> 2) Have a flag for "don't use fancy exceptions"

[09:19] <jnthn> 3) Use that flag when compiling CORE..setting

[09:19] <jnthn> Otherwise we may have some...fun...working out problems in CORE.setting ;)

[09:19] <moritz> I would have thought: just use plain nqp::die if find_symbol doesn't succeed

[09:20] *** SHODAN joined
[09:20] <jnthn> Well, find_symbol throws if it can't find the symbol

[09:20] <jnthn> You could do it that way too.

[09:20] <moritz> I can catch that

[09:20] <jnthn> right.

[09:20] <jnthn> Yeah, that works also.

[09:20] <moritz> I don't like the idea of separate flags for setting compilation

[09:20] <jnthn> Actually it's probably easier

[09:20] <jnthn> Yeah, your suggestion is better.

[09:21] <jnthn> moritz++

[09:21] <jnthn> btw, you can also

[09:21] <moritz> so, where should I stick that utility routine for dying?

[09:21] <jnthn> my $die := $*ST.find_symbol(['&die'])

[09:21] <jnthn> moritz: Initially, in Actions.pm is fine

[09:22] <moritz> jnthn: should be available in Grammar.pm too, in the long run

[09:22] <jnthn> moritz: If we need it in more places than that, we can figure out where to move it.

[09:22] <jnthn> ah

[09:22] <moritz> well, starting with Actions.pm probably works for me

[09:22] <jnthn> Grammar.pm does use Actions iirc.

[09:23] <moritz> maybe the "correct" way is to patch CURSOR.panic

[09:23] * moritz not so sure

[09:24] <moritz> because it has the line number available

[09:24] <jnthn> Well, or a panic in Grammar.pm

[09:24] <moritz> right, perl 6 specific, not nqp

[09:24] <jnthn> (e.g. leave the current one intact, but override it in the Perl 6 grammar)

[11:04] <pmichaud> as for #1, there are still several parts of the spec that use C<Exception>, so I went with that even though they may be fossils due to your work.

[11:05] <pmichaud> Feel free to change it if needed.  Also, it feels a little odd for a core type to be in a nested package when afaik none of the others are yet.

[11:06] <pmichaud> haven't forgotten about --gen-parrot; just haven't had the tuits to fix it yet.  Will do that now.

[11:16] <moritz> pmichaud: thanks for the answers. FWIW I already switched to $!ex

[12:37] <pmichaud> anyway, the "is copy" is there because each Hash entry needs its own scalar container (i.e., we want to bind to a container with the value, not to the value itself)

[12:38] <pmichaud> eventually the code will be     method STORE_AT_KEY(Str \$key, T $x is copy)    which will limit the elements to whatever type the Hash is restricted to (e.g.,  my Foo %h)

[13:51] <PerlJam> perhaps

[13:51] <PerlJam> But theming is important.

[13:52] <pmichaud> I mean, it's not hard to find lists of Perl Mongers groups :)

[13:54] <huf> there's 4 in lotr alone

[13:54] <huf> surely we can find more in legends and whatnot

[13:54] <PerlJam> pmichaud: actually I think part of the problem with naming the rakudo release is that they happen too often.

[13:54] <pmichaud> PerlJam: as I said, how hard is it to pick a .pm group?  ;-)

[13:54] <TimToady> we could release once every N years like DNF

[14:06] <tadzik> well, don't you love her?

[14:06] <huf> i fail to see the connection

[14:06] <PerlJam> she still acts like a teenager sometimes, so I'm not sure "woman" is entirely correct

[14:28] <pmichaud> colomon: excellent!

[14:28] <pmichaud> I need to read up a bit more on what bubaflub has so far

[14:29] <colomon> pmichaud: looking at the GMP release notes, it looks like the latest version fixes the OS X bug, but still has a bug with gcc 4.3.2 and 64-bits.

[14:29] <pmichaud> the winxed sources has it creating specialized BigInt Parrot classes... and that's not going to work for nqp/nom

[14:29] *** benabik left
[14:29] *** benabik_ is now known as benabik

[14:29] <pmichaud> (in nqp/nom we tend to avoid Parrot objects ... like a plague.)

[14:31] *** JimmyZ left
[14:32] <jnthn> Int in Rakudo should not really use int, but instead some other repr that we can compile-time decide which bigint library to use.

[14:32] <[Coke]> pmichaud: a list of nqp opcodes would be spif. I imagine they'd have to go in ~nqp/docs/opcodes.pod or something.

[14:34] <pmichaud> [Coke]: there's already https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/nqp-opcode.txt but I suspect we need a bit more detail

[14:34] <colomon> pmichaud, jnthn: errr.... okay, what can we do about big ints, then?

[14:34] <pmichaud> and I need to update that list

[14:35] <pmichaud> colomon: I think my suggestion would be to get a NQPBigInt class working in NQP.

[14:35] <pmichaud> don't worry yet about how we'll integrate it with Rakudo... just get something that works there :-)

[14:36] *** JimmyZ joined
[14:36] <pmichaud> you probably won't be able to make use of the standard +/-/etc operators yet either -- those are pretty closely tied to the VM  (i.e., infix:<+> is currently always  add__NNN

[14:36] <jnthn> How is Parrot exposing GMP?

[14:36] <pmichaud> jnthn: a set of NCI bindings, I think.

[14:36] <jnthn> pmichaud: A.

[14:36] <jnthn> *Ah

[14:36] <jnthn> That's better than I expected, in a way.

[14:36] <colomon> I believe that's right.  it's an external library right now, too.

[14:36] <pmichaud> the external library does the Parrot classes, which won't work for us.

[14:36] <jnthn> I was fearing "there's this BigInt PMC that you should use" :)

[14:37] <[Coke]> pmichaud: that's a good start. I can probably flesh that out with descriptions.

[14:37] <colomon> https://github.com/bubaflub/parrot-gmp

[14:37] <colomon> is the library

[14:37] <jnthn> The thing is that I mostly think of this as a C-level integration, not a PIR level one.

[14:37] <pmichaud> I agree, I'd prefer it to be a C-level integration

[14:37] <pmichaud> but for this early stage, if Parrot can handle the "how do we get the library loaded" part, that's less we have to deal with :)

[14:38] <jnthn> That's indeed true.

[14:38] <[Coke]> t/01-sanity/06-eqv.t looks like an eaaaasy test to get to pass in nom. ;)

[14:38] <pmichaud> https://github.com/bubaflub/parrot-gmp/blob/master/src/GMP/raw.pir  seems to show the nci interface available

[14:38] * [Coke] ponders.

[14:39] <pmichaud> [Coke]: yes, it should be relatively easy.

[14:39] <pmichaud> just look for &infix:<===> and do similar things for &infix:<eqv>

[14:39] <pmichaud> although I don't know if Test.pm still uses <eqv> anymore

[14:40] <pmichaud> Yes, it does.  So yes, we need it.

[14:40] *** mberends left
[14:41] <[Coke]> in nom, I only see those defined in src/old.

[14:41] <pmichaud> there are also some reasonable definitions of infix:<eqv> in master,  src/core/operators.pm

[14:41] <pmichaud> right, we haven't implemented <eqv> at all yet in nom

[14:41] <[Coke]> is src/old even compiled in nom, or just for reference?

[14:42] <moritz> just for reference

[14:42] <pmichaud> it's jus.... moritz++

[14:42] *** leprevost joined
[14:42] <jnthn> Note that you'll need at least a proto infix:<eqv>($, $) { * } too

[14:42] <pmichaud> and eliminate the "our"'s

[14:42] <jnthn> That too :)

[14:44] <PerlJam> Are there any LHF not listed in LHF.markdown?

[14:44] <pmichaud> listing LHF's isn't LHF :)

[14:44] <[Coke]> mmhehehehe.

[14:44] * [Coke] tries to do the bare minimum to get that test to pass...

[14:45] <moritz> fwiw I think that what is now in IO should really be IO::File or IO::Stream or so

[14:45] <pmichaud> feel free to change it

[14:45] <tadzik> if I started moving Pod work into nom, is it better to merge nom into my current branch, or start a new branch being a child of nom?

[14:45] <colomon> pmichaud, jnthn: okay, so we want NQPBigInt.  Hints on how to start that process?  

[14:45] <moritz> tadzik: the latter

[14:46] <tadzik> oki-doki

[14:46] <jnthn> tadzik: Provided it's non-regressional, you're welcome to merge into nom at regular intervals too.

[14:46] <[Coke]> \o/

[14:46] <colomon> is non-regressional a processional?  

[14:46] * TimToady demonstrates emergent behavior

[14:46] <jnthn> :D

[14:47] <tadzik> jnthn: so far, while it was in master, it made it pass more spectests, bringing no regressions

[14:47] <jnthn> tadzik: My suggestion is to get your grammar changes into nom, then the POD AST into CORE.setting.

[14:48] <tadzik> yeah, that's the plan

[14:48] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/1056377

[14:48] <[Coke]> pmichaud, jnthn : that ok to commit to nom?

[14:49] <tadzik> and a bit of experimentations with with symboltable

[14:49] <pmichaud> [Coke]: works for me

[14:49] <jnthn> tadzik: Yup.

[14:49] <pmichaud> although I wonder if the signature should be      Numeric ::T $a, T $b

[14:49] <jnthn> tadzik: You gonna be doing .WHO also?

[14:49] *** bubaflub joined
[14:49] <pmichaud> should the POD AST be a separate module, ooc?

[14:50] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6fff4677aa

[14:50] <tadzik> I thought .WHO is your fruit :)

[14:50] <jnthn> tadzik: I meant .WHY :)

[14:50] <[Coke]> pmichaud: does your signature force the 2 numerics to be the same type?

[14:50] <jnthn> Yeah, I did .WHO

[14:50] <pmichaud> [Coke]: yes.

[14:50] <pmichaud> but as jnthn says -- NYI :)

[14:50] <[Coke]> at that point, do you still need the .WHAT check?

[14:51] <pmichaud> right, I'm thinking we don't need the .WHAT check after that

[14:51] <jnthn> Keep .WHAT check for now.

[14:51] <pmichaud> agreed, keep it for now.

[14:51] <[Coke]> better to force as much of that into the sigs as possible.

[14:51] <[Coke]> k. good, pushed.

[14:51] <tadzik> jnthn: .WHY is pretty far in my calendar fwiw, but I don't mind moving things around a bit as long as itmoritz and masak are happy with it and it happens to be more beneficial to Rakudo

[14:51] <jnthn> Use of a type var in the sig it's declard in is gonna be...fun.

[14:52] <[Coke]> down to 5 failing test files in "make test"

[14:52] <jnthn> tadzik: I've no real priorities on it, just curious so I can ponder ahead. :)

[14:53] <tadzik> jnthn: .WHY is the most exciting thing in my gsocwork, at least for me :)

[14:53] <pmichaud> yes, I'm jealous about .WHY

[14:53] <pmichaud> I wanted to do .WHY this year but likely won't have the tuits

[14:53] <pmichaud> (not as long as there's so much else to work on)

[14:54] <jnthn> pmichaud: That's fine, we have tadzik++ to do it. :)

[14:54] <pmichaud> jnthn: you're missing the point, which is that .WHY is existing and -Ofun and I only get to watch vicariously.  :)

[14:54] <jnthn> Ah

[14:54] <jnthn> "features I wish I'd implemented" :)

[14:55] <tadzik> also, we'd havly decide on how we want declarator blocks to work

[14:55] <[Coke]> ./perl6 t/02-embed/01-load.t --> Method 'at_key' not found for invocant of class 'Failure'

[14:55] <[Coke]> is that the real fix, or is it likely that something's fail()ing that shouldn't?

[14:55] <jnthn> [Coke]: I suspect the embedding interface is going to want a thorough going over.

[14:56] <pmichaud> in this case, it's probably because there's no $*VM defined.

[14:56] <pmichaud> so that's coming back as a Failure, which doesn't know how to <config>

[14:56] <jnthn> aha

[14:57] <[Coke]> looks like adding in "undefine" from master gets us another test file. safe to do?

[14:58] <pmichaud> [Coke]: sure, I'll review the patches and revert/fix if needed.

[14:58] <pmichaud> colomon: I'm still thinking on bigint/nqp

[14:58] * jnthn too

[14:58] <jnthn> Trouble is I have a pretty fixed idea of what the eventual solution should look like.

[14:59] <tadzik> ouch, what did I write

[14:59] <jnthn> And am trying to work out a part-way solution that won't involve a do-over.

[14:59] <tadzik> also, we'd hae to finally decide how we want declarator blocks to work

[14:59] <pmichaud> jnthn: then perhaps you can describe that solution :)

[14:59] <tadzik> there

[15:00] <jnthn> I think we should have a repr, along the lines of P6int, but P6bigint or some such

[15:00] <jnthn> It knows how to store an int in normal or upgraded form

[15:00] <jnthn> That means it's a piece of memory that has an INTVAL plus whatever struct/pointer the bigint library we're compiling in wants

[15:00] <jnthn> Then a bunch of ops that target this.

[15:01] <jnthn> That handle either doing an INTVAL operation and upgrade on demand.

[15:01] <jnthn> The hurdle is that I didn't do complex inlines yet.

[15:02] <jnthn> But a P6bigint repr (addition to src/6model/repr/) could easily be used right off 

[15:02] <pmichaud> so, to me the first step is to just get a POC where we don't worry about upgrading... i.e., everything is bigint

[15:02] <jnthn> e.g. by class Foo is repr('P6bigint') { ... }

[15:02] <jnthn> pmichaud: That's fine also, *if* we make it a repr.

[15:03] <pmichaud> right

[15:03] <jnthn> And a bunch of ops.

[15:03] <jnthn> But repr implies written in C, as do ops.

[15:03] <pmichaud> "ops" could be handled for now by subs that go through the NCI interface

[15:03] <jnthn> Maybe but getting them a pointer to the right thing could be fun.

[15:03] <pmichaud> sub add(NQPBigInt $a, NQPBigInt $b) { ... }

[15:03] <jnthn> pmichaud: By ops I meant, dynops.

[15:03] <pmichaud> yes, I know that's what you meant.

[15:04] <jnthn> ah, OK

[15:04] <pmichaud> the problem I have with "bunch of dynops" is that it sounds to me like we're recreating vtables.  Which we may be (but doing it right this time), but we need to consider the larger architecture for our ops a bit too

[15:04] <jnthn> But what do the NCIs expect us to give them?

[15:04] <pmichaud> jnthn: well, that's what I'm thinking colomon++ can figure out :)

[15:05] <jnthn> ah, OK :)

[15:05] *** alim left
[15:05] <jnthn> I think that we will end up with a set of ops that are specific to a repr.

[15:05] *** alim joined
[15:05] <colomon> if you mean in terms of types, gmp has a mpz_t for integers

[15:05] <jnthn> We'll have some list-y and hash-y ones

[15:06] <jnthn> colomon: Yes, that sounds like what I am talking about.

[15:06] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/37ff459759

[15:06] <jnthn> pmichaud: I agree that we'll want to try and structure that a bit more

[15:06] <jnthn> pmichaud: I disagree we're re-invenitng v-tables.

[15:07] <jnthn> reprs aren't meant to be dispatchy really

[15:07] <pmichaud> they kind of are dispatchy if we have to create a set of custom ops for each :)

[15:08] <tadzik> nom: my $a = 5; $a = Any; say defined $a

[15:08] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT¬´Bool::False‚ê§¬ª

[15:08] <jnthn> True; I was thinking "polymorphically dispatchy"

[15:08] <tadzik> colomon: wouldn't that be easier?

[15:08] <[Coke]> down to 4 failing files in "make test"

[15:08] <tadzik> oopsie, [Coke] 

[15:08] <pmichaud> tadzik: that might be easier but what Coke has is more futureproof

[15:08] <pmichaud> since the meaning of "undefined" might change :-)

[15:08] <tadzik> huh

[15:09] <pmichaud> we still don't know exactly what  "my $x"  is supposed to produce :)

[15:09] <pmichaud> (although yes, we're all pretty much agreed that it initializes to Any.  The type constraint is the part we don't know.)

[15:09] <TimToady> why do we initialize to Any?

[15:09] <pmichaud> There is a question though about what happens with     my Int $y;  undefine $y

[15:09] <PerlJam> I liked  the "my Mu $x = Any;" version

[15:10] <jnthn> TimToady: Because the various auto-vivs live in Any, iirc.

[15:10] <pmichaud> we initialize to Any because we expect Any's methods to work on uninitialized variables.

[15:10] <pmichaud> like autoviv.

[15:10] <pmichaud> unless you want to put those methods on Mu.

[15:10] <TimToady> would they not work in Mu?

[15:10] <jnthn> If you put them on Mu then junctions won't auto-thread them.

[15:11] <TimToady> do we want autoviv autothreading?

[15:11] <TimToady> it seems problematic

[15:11] <jnthn> TimToady: You've missed the point. 

[15:11] <[Coke]> (I didn't think about undefine at all. I just pulled it from master.)

[15:11] <pmichaud> it's not just autoviv, but also  .join .map .list .elems .reverse ....

[15:11] <jnthn> TimToady: Things that cause auto-viv may also have totally normal meanings.

[15:11] <jnthn> That we would want to have autothread.

[15:11] <pmichaud> Any has a lot of methods in it (many of which should autothread)

[15:13] *** prammer_ is now known as prammer

[15:13] <PerlJam> pmichaud: so what's the debate on the type constraint?

[15:13] <PerlJam> (why not Mu?)

[15:14] <TimToady> I don't really like the type split Mu/Any constraint/initializer split

[15:14] <TimToady> if there's some way we can get away from that without going insane

[15:14] <pmichaud> TimToady: on 5-16 you said you prefered the constraint to be Any/Any

[15:14] <pmichaud> I think that's workable.

[15:14] <TimToady> yes, well, but that's also going to be slowish

[15:15] <jnthn> TimToady: I mostly consider it a compromise to achieve sanity.

[15:15] <jnthn> But my version of sanity includes "can assign a junction to an untyped scalar"

[15:15] <jnthn> (Because I think untyped programs should largely dwim.)

[15:15] <tadzik> moritz: would you mind if I swapped my gsoc goals for the two upcoming weeks? $=POD seems like a lot more important thing to do, also it's harder for me to estimate the time amount needed for that

[15:15] *** cotto left
[15:16] <TimToady> Any/Any is better than Mu/Any, but I'd like to eventually have a 'use deftype MyType' kind of pragma that would work with Mu, Any, Cool, etc

[15:16] <jnthn> TimToady: Do we want to make junctions more effort to store in a scalar?

[15:16] <PerlJam> TimToady: and  my $x = 1 | 2;  # would fail?

[15:16] <TimToady> I'm just wondering if there's a way to intuit an autoviv type other than by putting things into Any

[15:17] <pmichaud> my $x;  $x<a> = 'hello';    

[15:17] <pmichaud> the .<a> is a method on Any.

[15:17] <pmichaud> (or whatever we default $x to)

[15:17] <TimToady> PerlJam: whether we default to Mu/Mu, Any/Any, Cool/Cool should be an independent strictness decision, and I'd like autoviv to work in any case

[15:18] <PerlJam> TimToady: so ... you're sort of talking about an auto-coercion mediated by a pragma?

[15:18] <TimToady> coercion is also independent from the declared type of a container

[15:18] *** pernatiy left
[15:19] <TimToady> I just think giving containers two different types is kinda insane

[15:19] <TimToady> can the autoviv type be supplied by Mu noticing method dispatch failure?

[15:19] <jnthn> TimToady: It doesn't have two types, though.

[15:19] <jnthn> It has a type constraint and a default value.

[15:20] <pmichaud> jnthn: I think he means the fact that those are of different types.

[15:20] <jnthn> Where the default value is the Any type object.

[15:20] *** cotto joined
[15:20] <TimToady> well, I guess default makes more sense on an array or hash

[15:21] <TimToady> okay, I can bend my mind around that for scalars too

[15:21] <jnthn> It is a discontinuity in a sense.

[15:22] <jnthn> Yes, we could try and do something on dispatch failure but it's a bit icky.

[15:22] <TimToady> so anyway, leaving defaults out of it, except for the fact that the default must match the constraint type

[15:22] <TimToady> it'd still be nice to be able to dial in the default constraint of Mu, Any, Cool

[15:23] <TimToady> presumably if you constrain your vars to Cool you don't want to do anything fancy :)

[15:23] <pmichaud> I'm fine with having a pragma for the default variable type, I think.

[15:23] <TimToady> well, the two main choices for default are Mu and Any

[15:23] <pmichaud> for arrays and hashes we already get the constraint from 'of'

[15:24] <TimToady> Mu is faster, Any is "safer"

[15:24] <PerlJam> so if "my $x" means "my Mu $x = Any",  what does "my %h;"  mean exactly?

[15:24] *** pernatiy joined
[15:24] <pmichaud> PerlJam:   my %h of Mu;    presumably

[15:24] <PerlJam> and how does autoviv work in that case?

[15:24] <TimToady> and we could have the same or different constraints for scalars, arrays, hashes

[15:25] <pmichaud> PerlJam: the containers could still be defaulted to Any

[15:25] <TimToady> use scalar Mu; use array Any

[15:25] <jnthn> PerlJam: I guess because a hash is actually a store of scalars, which default to Any

[15:25] <TimToady> use code Cool;  # :D

[15:25] <pmichaud> in nom, they default to exactly whatever a scalar defaults to :-)

[15:25] <jnthn> nom: my %h; say %h<lol>.WHAT

[15:26] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT¬´Any()‚ê§¬ª

[15:26] <PerlJam> ok.

[15:26] <PerlJam> makes sense to me, but it's going to require lots of words in explanation I think when it comes time to explain it to relative newebies.

[15:26] <jnthn> pmichaud: heh, do you actually use my $ to get a container? :)

[15:27] <pmichaud> jnthn: I use "is copy"

[15:27] <pmichaud> which iirc does basically the same thing.

[15:27] <jnthn> pmichaud: ah

[15:27] <jnthn> :)

[15:27] <pmichaud> STORE_AT_KEY(\%hash, $x is copy) { ... }

[15:27] <pmichaud> eventually I expect that to be

[15:27] <pmichaud> STORE_AT_KEY(\%hash, T $x is copy) { ... }

[15:27] <pmichaud> which puts on the constraint

[15:28] <pmichaud> s/'\%hash'/'\$key'/  above

[15:28] <jnthn> *nod*

[15:28] <jnthn> When somebody gets around to making the parametrics work. :)

[15:30] <pmichaud> so, sounds like we're going with  "my $x"  meaning  Mu/Any for now

[15:30] <pmichaud> wfm

[15:30] <pmichaud> eventually a pragma to be able to declare the default constraint (and initialization?) type for scalars

[15:31] <TimToady> it's a shame we can't express the default with "my $x = Any"

[15:31] <TimToady> as we can with parameters

[15:31] <pmichaud> that was somewhat the other reason for making "my $x" mean "my Any $x" in my mind -- it then matched parameter declarations.

[15:32] <TimToady> no point in that unless we want it to autothread :)

[15:32] <pmichaud> indeed, that was also jnthn++'s response :)

[15:32] <PerlJam> jnthn: is there some minimal set of things required for a repr?

[15:35] <jnthn> PerlJam: A repname.c/.h file and a registration, plus at least implement type_object_for and instance_of, I suspect.

[15:35] <jnthn> P6int.c is an example of a rather simple repr

[15:35] <jnthn> P6opaque.c is an example of a terrifying one. :)

[15:35] <jnthn> HashAttrStore is somewhere between the two.

[15:36] <PerlJam> thanks.

[15:47] <[Coke]> colomon: +1

[15:48] <colomon> okay, one more question for uc.t: assignment to $_ doesn't work in nom?

[15:49] <jnthn> colomon: Do you ahve latest?

[15:49] <pmichaud> depends on how $_ is bound

[15:49] <colomon>     $_ = "Hello World";

[15:49] <colomon>     my $x = .uc;

[15:49] <colomon> is the test

[15:49] * jnthn did a bunch of fixes there early today

[15:49] <colomon> Cannot assign to a non-container

[15:49] <colomon> was the error.

[15:49] <pmichaud> that should work (after jnthn++'s fixes earlier)

[15:49] <pmichaud> it wasn't working as of yesterday.

[15:49] <jnthn> nom: $_ = "Hello World"; say .uc

[15:53] <[Coke]> well then, I especially vote for colomon.

[15:53] <jnthn> huh.

[15:53] <colomon> see, not just me

[15:54] <jnthn> nom: { say $_.WHAT }

[15:54] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT¬´Mu()‚ê§¬ª

[15:54] <pmichaud> is the outer $_ being initialized properly?

[15:54] <pmichaud> is it a 'rw' bind?  ;-)

[15:54] <jnthn> pmichaud: It should be happening on demand

[15:54] <[Coke]> so, 'make test' has the literals, the embedding, regexen, and a proto and dispatch auto-generation for multis not yet implemented at line 15, near "multi sub "

[15:54] <benabik>  nom: say .WHAT, '?'

[15:54] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT¬´Any()?‚ê§¬ª

[15:54] <pmichaud> what happens if the demand comes from a nested block?

[15:54] <jnthn> pmichaud: I *thought* I handled that case.

[15:54] <pmichaud> okay

[15:55] <jnthn> Clearly, I got it not quite right somehow.

[15:55] <pmichaud> then I guess nom is wrong :)

[15:55] <pmichaud> nom:  "pay attention to what jnthn wrote!"

[15:55] <p6eval> nom:  ( no output )

[15:55] <jnthn> :P

[15:55] <pmichaud> (nom is speechless)

[15:56] <[Coke]> for updating spec tests, is the goal to pass all the tests that master is passing (so don't todo failing tests, only untodo passing tests) or is it to reflect reality on the nom-ground?

[15:56] <PerlJam> what do you expect with a mouth full of food?

[15:56] <TimToady> though we could express a default with 'my ($x = Any)' though that doesn't work too well for arrays

[15:56] <colomon> nested block, that's it!  if you strip off the {  }, that line works

[15:56] <pmichaud> the goal is to pass all of the tests that master is passing.  However, if a test would pass "but for one or two tests", I'm okay with fudging it to include it in the passing tests.

[15:57] <pmichaud> but in general I'd err on the side of not bringing in a passing test until we have at least master's capabilities

[15:57] <pmichaud> s/passing/almost-passing/

[15:57] <pmichaud> that way we know where we're regressing from master

[15:58] *** dolmen joined
[15:59] <jnthn> nom: $_ = 42; { say $_ }

[15:59] <colomon> but that way we have less information about when we're regressing from old nom to newer nom...

[15:59] <jnthn> hm

[15:59] <pmichaud> I'm not quite worried about old-to-newer nom yet.

[16:00] <pmichaud> I'm much more concerned about regressions against master.  If we add fudges to too many tests, I'm worried we lose that.  (Yes, this might contradict my earlier statements a bit.)

[16:00] <pmichaud> it may also mean we should refactor a test file, potentially -- that it may be trying to do too many things.

[16:00] <pmichaud> and I'm okay with that.

[16:00] <[Coke]> ... right. too complicated. nevemrind. ;)

[18:58] <dalek> specs: which which was found wanting.

[18:58] <dalek> specs: review: https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/e881c784d6

[18:58] <dalek> specs: 94d0124 | larry++ | S06-routines.pod:

[18:58] <dalek> specs: severely restrict named-to-positional binding

[18:58] <dalek> specs: 

[18:58] <dalek> specs: Binding named args to positional parameters is now restricted to

[18:58] <dalek> specs: explicit C<proto> and C<only> declarations.  But we will support it,

[18:58] <dalek> specs: since it can have profound refactoring advantages if you don't have

[18:58] <dalek> specs: to know which parameters will eventually end up as positionals.

[19:19] <pmichaud> then I'll do more metaops.

[19:19] <masak> I'm not convinced that I'm happy about the spec patch. reading that and re-reading https://gist.github.com/984783 , I now conclude we've ended up with the same basic problems, but a more complicated spec. :(

[19:19] <TimToady> you're just wrong

[19:19] <masak> please tell me how.

[19:19] <moritz> oh, is nqp::p6box_i already available in Actions.pm?

[19:19] <TimToady> it's simpler, and your problem is solved

[19:19] <moritz> Unrecognized nqp:: opcode 'nqp::p6box_i' at line 2719, near ";\n        "

[19:19] *** soh_cah_toa joined
[19:20] <pmichaud> why use nqp::p6box_i in Actions.pm?  (not saying it's wrong, just wanting to know the use case)

[19:20] <moritz> to pass to Rat.new

[19:20] *** kthakore joined
[19:20] <pmichaud> In Actions.pm that should already be a serialized constant.

[19:20] <masak> TimToady: the manifesto asks for named arguments not to be bindable to positional parameters. the spec patch that followed on that one removed that; this last one adds it back (for protos).

[19:20] <pmichaud> no need to box it.

[19:21] <kthakore> ..What was that perl6 NCI thing?

[19:21] <kthakore> it was a module I installed a while back

[19:21] <moritz> pmichaud: I want to pass a Perl 6 integer to Rat.new, and serialize the result

[19:21] <TimToady> the manifesto is misguided, then, since there are good reasons to use named calls for refactorability

[19:21] <moritz> kthakore: Zavolaj, NativeCall.pm

[19:21] <kthakore> NativeCall.pm!!!

[19:21] <TimToady> and we've enabled that only if explicitly requested

[19:21] <TimToady> and it's simpler because there's only a single choice point

[19:22] <kthakore> TimToady: hi. Sorry to butt in. But I hugged you at keynote :) ... 

[19:22] * kthakore runs away to make SDL script for Util 

[19:22] <TimToady> you should hug masak++ right now :)

[19:22] <kthakore> I never stopped hugging him

[19:22] *** lichtkind joined
[19:22] * kthakore Hugs masak harder

[19:23] <pmichaud> moritz: for now you might have to use the pir:: version of the opcode.  The registration of the p6-specific opcodes happens at INIT of Actions.pm (which would be after it's compiled)

[19:23] <masak> I'm not being deliberately obtuse or difficult.

[19:23] <pmichaud> that's a good argument to move those registrations somewhere else.

[19:23] <lichtkind> thou: hai

[19:23] <lichtkind> cheers to all

[19:23] <moritz> what's the name of the pir:: opcde? perl6_repr_box_int ?

[19:23] <pmichaud> anyway, you'll probably need pir::perl6_box_int__PI(...)

[19:23] <kthakore> Util: FOUND IT :D

[19:24] <moritz> ah

[19:24] <kthakore> Util: https://gist.github.com/744192

[19:24] <masak> as far as I can see, the benefits of "refactorability" are equally and oppositely offset by the downsides of API leakage.

[19:24] <pmichaud> and I'll figure out a way to get the Perl 6 nqp:: opcodes available to nqp a bit earlier.

[19:24] <TimToady> the API leakage is not leakage if it's intentional

[19:24] <masak> it's not intentional if people aren't aware of the rules of protos.

[19:25] <TimToady> and naming your proto positionals is now deemed to be intentional

[19:25] <masak> you've just moved the issue.

[19:25] <Util> kthakore: reading...

[19:25] <thou> lichtkind: \o

[19:26] <thou> lichtkind: nicht viel zeit jetzt, leider

[19:26] <masak> 'Since Perl 6 programmers (experienced and newbie alike) don't seem to realize the feature is there, this has a high probability of leading to "over-defining" of APIs. That might not sound so bad until one realizes that a module author has committed not to change the names of any parameters in the module's exported routines.'

[19:26] <masak> that's just as true now as two spec patches ago.

[19:26] *** molaf left
[19:27] <masak> though fewer people will define protos, so fewer people will learn the rules, so it'll bite all the harder when it bites.

[19:27] <pmichaud> masak: iiuc, the author commits not to change the names of any parameters in the module's exported protos.

[19:27] <pmichaud> and normally we write protos namelessly.

[19:27] <moritz> pmichaud: it seems that perl6_ops isn't even loaded in Actions.pm

[19:27] <TimToady> that is just part of the definition of a proto, and if the proto writer doesn't understand that, they're just under-educated

[19:27] <moritz> ie in gen/perl6-actions.pir

[19:28] <TimToady> you seem to be arguing that the API designer should not be allowed to have control of the API at this point

[19:28] <pmichaud> moritz: we probably need to pass it as a library argument to nqp then.

[19:28] <moritz> pmichaud: ah right

[19:29] *** wamba left
[19:30] <masak> I'm arguing that under-educated API designers will be a fact of life, and that they'll over-define their API all the time.

[19:30] *** birdwindupbird joined
[19:30] <TimToady> fine, a default warning that can easily be disabled would be fine by me

[19:30] <masak> did the binder become less complicated from this change? if so, I don't see it.

[19:30] <masak> things still need to go through the proto somehow.

[19:30] <pmichaud> masak: welcome to "torment the implementors on behalf of the users."

[19:31] <TimToady> yes, currently master's binder has to remap nameds on *every* multi

[19:31] <masak> pmichaud: as a user, I don't feel "on-behalfed" in this case.

[19:31] <TimToady> in the new approach, this can only happen when the proto is called

[19:31] <colomon> rakudo: say 1i.exp(3)

[19:31] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUT¬´0.45483242282661 + 0.890577041667747i‚ê§¬ª

[19:31] <masak> sure, that's the new multi semantics. I'm fine with that.

[19:31] <TimToady> there is only one place to look for the official API

[19:31] <masak> in fact, it's a big improvement over the last multi semantics. kudos for that.

[19:31] <TimToady> no, it's completely orthogonal to the new multi semantics

[19:32] <masak> ok.

[19:32] <TimToady> the new semantics are done by master, but it still remaps each multi

[19:32] <kthakore> Util: you will need https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj 

[19:32] <masak> oh.

[19:32] <TimToady> or at least niecza does that, so it's independent

[19:34] <TimToady> well, rakudo used to do it, anywa

[19:35] <masak> so... there's some "signature algebra" involved, that maps the arguments of the call directly to the underlying multi, even though the names of the positionals refer to those in the proto?

[19:35] <kthakore> Util: made a repo https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL6 ... I have to learn how to make modules in Perl6 tough to do the deps stuff

[19:35] <dukeleto> kthakore: indeed there is

[19:35] <kthakore> dukeleto: hallo :) ... I have you on my list too PROMISES_AT_YAPC

[19:36] <dukeleto> kthakore: it is quite alpha-ish, but does something: https://github.com/tadzik/module-starter

[19:36] <kthakore> dukeleto: thanks 

[19:36] <moritz> $ ./perl6 -e '3.0'

[19:36] <moritz> Don't know how to build a rational constant

[19:36] <dukeleto> kthakore: it mostly just creates the new metadata file for perl 6 modules

[19:36] <TimToady> masak: by the time any multi sees it, it's always positional

[19:36] <dukeleto> kthakore: it doesn't even give you a module skeleton, yet

[19:36] <kthakore> dukeleto: can I have it get the https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj stuff for me?

[19:36] <dukeleto> kthakore: please fork and send pull requests :)

[19:36] <moritz> it seems the serializer can only handle native types?

[19:36] <TimToady> (the proto's positional args are, not nameds, which stay nameds)

[19:37] <kthakore> dukeleto: :D will do if something bugs me that much. Right now I have 6 moar promises to get to

[19:37] <pmichaud> moritz: I don't know if the serializer is smart enough to handle setting types yet.

[19:37] <dukeleto> ETOOMANYPROMISES

[19:37] <masak> TimToady: so there are two dispatches: caller->proto, then proto->multi?

[19:37] <moritz> kthakore: http://modules.perl6.org/ has all the pointers you need

[19:37] <kthakore> dukeleto: ... I keep them or die tryin :D

[19:37] <moritz> kthakore: both for how to declare dependencies, and where to get the installer that follows them

[19:37] <TimToady> there always were two, since several months ago

[19:37] <kthakore> moritz++ thanks 

[19:37] <TimToady> but the first one is usually inlineable, at least for functions

[19:38] *** bakedb left
[19:38] <pmichaud> moritz: I think that jnthn++ had said that serializing the setting types was likely to be post-nom-to-master

[19:38] <TimToady> the remapping of named is now restricted to the first dispatch, and only to ones explicitly declared proto or only

[19:38] <kthakore> moritz++ I think you just saved my life

[19:38] <kthakore> Util: https://github.com/quietfanatic/gamebase/

[19:38] *** bluescreen10 left
[19:39] <kthakore> nvm ... that is ... not gonna work anymore

[19:39] <masak> I feel I understand the mechanics better from this conversation, but I don't feel reassured. I'm afraid I'll remain sceptical of this feature until I can get my hands on an implementation of it.

[19:40] <TimToady> that's fair

[19:40] *** cotto joined
[19:41] <masak> from my current viewpoint, it'd be better for everyone involved if named-arg => positional-param mapping just went away entirely. but we seem to disagree on that.

[19:41] *** cotto left
[19:41] *** cotto joined
[19:42] <moritz> what about only allowing it on explicit protos (and disallowing it on autogenerated protos)?

[19:42] *** wamba joined
[19:43] <pmichaud> masak: I disagree with that.  I've given a couple of cases where named-arg => positional-param would be useful.

[19:44] <pmichaud> I think the fact that it's not been used much yet has to do with the types and numbers of libraries we've implemented thus far.

[19:44] <masak> possibly.

[19:44] <pmichaud> I also wonder if it's important for .assuming

[19:44] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 8bd86ac | moritz++ | / (2 files):

[19:44] <dalek> rakudo/nom: start with Rat literals

[19:44] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 

[19:44] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Sadly it does not work yet, but maybe it inspires jnthn++ to tell me how to work around the serializer limitations

[19:44] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8bd86ac97e

[19:45] <moritz> this patch doesn't add any working functionality, but it doesn't cause regressions either, afaict

[19:45] <masak> "important for .assuming" relies on the kind of API leakage I would like to see not happen.

[19:45] *** Moukeddar left
[19:46] <masak> in fact, I think if the Perl 6 spec itself took that leakage seriously enough, S28 and S32 would look very different when it comes to the naming of positionals.

[19:46] <masak> right now they're written as if they were for internal use only, with little thought to consistency and interface.

[19:46] <moritz> agreed

[19:47] <moritz> I wanted to at least partially change that, but then the feature was abolished :-)

[19:47] <moritz> so no need anymore :-)

[19:47] *** birdwindupbird left
[19:47] <masak> guess a new chance has presented itself.

[19:47] <Util> kthakore: thanks; installing zavolaj

[19:47] <pmichaud> if I have   sub xyz($a, $b, $c) { ... }   and I want to do  xyz.assuming(:c(20)) .... how do I do that?  Or does assuming do introspection on the signature of &xyz to figure it out?

[19:47] <masak> moritz: it's a good idea anyhow.

[19:47] <moritz> for example I like index($haystack, $needle)

[19:47] <moritz> or index($in, $search) or so

[19:48] <masak> index($str, $substr)

[19:48] <pmichaud> yes, but for that matter S29 and S32 still have a lot of constraints on parameters that ought not be there.

[19:49] <masak> pmichaud: it would have to introspec the signature, I guess.

[19:49] <masak> introspect*

[19:49] <moritz> and they are silent on the Cool/Any variants

[19:50] <masak> just like docs and documentation, making S28 and S32 shine are big, boring, thankless tasks that no-one is likely to volunteer for.

[19:51] <kthakore> moritz: how do I get the sh bootstrap.sh to work. I don't see a ~/.perl6/ being made

[19:51] <kthakore> moritz: for panda

[19:51] <kthakore> Util: I am making it a module in a few

[19:51] <lichtkind> masak: what exactly for?

[19:51] <moritz> kthakore: you have to ask tadzik, he's the great module (installer) hacker

[19:52] *** bluescreen10 joined
[19:52] <masak> lichtkind: see the above discussion. S28/S32 aren't and have never been as exact in their signatures as a real implementation would require.

[19:52] <masak> lichtkind: they basically can't be trusted when it comes to details.

[19:53] <pmichaud> Here's an example:

[19:54] <pmichaud> S32:205:  =item length

[19:54] <pmichaud> This word is banned in Perl 6.  You must specify units.

[19:54] <pmichaud> S32:532:   our Str multi method substr (Str $string: StrPos $start, Int $length) is rw is export

[19:54] <pmichaud> First, "$length" is banned.

[19:54] <masak> d'oh!

[19:54] <pmichaud> Second, it should not be constrained to an Int.  Other Cool types should be allowed.

[19:55] <masak> aye.

[19:55] <moritz> same with StrPos - these days we just default to graphs

[19:55] <lichtkind> masak: so someone has to ask lot of questions and rewrite it and yes i followed you loosely

[19:55] <moritz> also, why the 'our'?

[19:55] <pmichaud> (sorry, those "S32" should be "Str.pod")

[19:55] <masak> lichtkind: yes, asking questions -- or basically doing what pmichaud++ just did -- would have to happen a lot.

[19:55] <masak> is someone here using Ubuntu 11.04 (natty), with a too-old version of Mono (2.6.7) to run Niecza? what did you do about it?

[19:56] <lichtkind> i use 11.4

[19:56] <moritz> masak: it was too old on my system too (though debian, not ubuntu). I just built mono from soure (or downloaded a linux binary? don#t remember)

[19:57] <moritz> and installed to /usr/local/

[19:57] <lichtkind> masak: what did pmichaud ++ ?

[19:57] <tadzik> kthakore: what's up with panda?

[19:57] <masak> lichtkind: he quoted two parts of S32/Str and pointed out how they conflicted.

[19:57] <pmichaud> ...and how they're incorrectly specified anyway.

[19:57] <masak> lichtkind: and how the latter has too strict a signature.

[19:58] <masak> moritz: ok, will try that.

[19:58] <masak> thanks.

[19:58] <TimToady> yes, any Int parameter should really be Int(), meaning Int(Cool)

[19:58] <pmichaud> thus Str.pod has some issues.  Much of S32 and S29 is like that -- where the items listed there are definitely incorrect, but nobody has taken the time to edit them to fix them.

[19:59] *** leprevost left
[19:59] <masak> some things are missing entirely. &uniq, for example.

[20:00] <masak> as far as I can gather, it was "spec'd through p6l".

[20:00] <lichtkind> is uniq a perl 6 builtin?

[20:00] <masak> not according to the spec :P

[20:00] <TimToady> there's no such thing as "perl 6"

[20:01] <moritz> but according to the tests there is

[20:01] <masak> there's no such thing as "builtin".

[20:05] <kthakore> Did i install perl6 wrong?

[20:05] <tadzik> no idea

[20:05] <tadzik> let me rebootstrap my panda on the newest rakudo, Justin Case

[20:06] <kthakore> ok I go do Justin too

[20:06] <kthakore> ... hehe

[20:06] <tadzik> kthakore: okay, does it exit immediately?

[20:07] <kthakore> yeah

[20:07] <kthakore> I am recompiling perl6

[20:07] <tadzik> okay. What happens when you just run 'perl6 bin/panda install .'?

[20:07] <kthakore> same

[20:08] <kthakore> I think my perl6 is lying to me about being installed

[20:08] <tadzik> how about 'perl6 -e "say 1"'?

[20:08] <kthakore> nothing :(

[20:08] <tadzik> there we are :)

[20:08] <kthakore> it was working 18hrs ago

[20:12] <tadzik> oh it prints stuff

[20:12] *** johnkw joined
[20:13] <kthakore> masak: hmm ... ok so I forgot how to install perl6 to /usr/local correctly. I did perl Configure.pl; make; sudo make install . which perl6 says /usr/local/bin/perl6

[20:13] <kthakore> but it works inside the perl6 repo

[20:13] <kthakore> the usr local one doesn't

[20:13] <moritz> kthakore: are you building the compiler, or the star release?

[20:13] <tadzik> how did Text::Mock work for you? :)

[20:14] <kthakore> tadzik: I dunno

[20:14] <kthakore> moritz: building

[20:14] <TimToady> generally much better to symlink the outer one to the inner one

[20:14] *** johnkw left
[20:14] <kthakore> okie lets try

[20:14] <tadzik> kthakore: I'm pretty sure you want that to be Test::Mock

[20:15] <kthakore> tadzik: fixed it

[20:15] <tadzik> kthakore: the tests pass for me now. Mind me adding the module to the ecosystem?

[20:15] <tadzik> colomon: ==> Succesfully installed Algorithm::Soundex

[20:15] <tadzik> looks cool

[20:16] <tadzik> colomon: failures?

[20:16] <colomon> Project Algorithm::Soundex not found in the ecosystem

[20:16] <kthakore> TimToady: ... linking gives me no dice

[20:16] <colomon> panda update

[20:16] <colomon> and now it seems to work

[20:16] <kthakore> tadzik: ermm it didn't work btw

[20:17] <kthakore> tadzik: you don't have libsdl I presume do you? It fails silently

[20:17] <tadzik> kthakore: what didn't?

[20:17] <tadzik> I think I do, I play wesnoth frequently :P

[20:19] <kthakore> it worked right after

[20:19] <kthakore> then now it is dead

[20:19] <lith_> TimToady, would something like that be useful as the irc summary you were thinking about?: http://lith-ology.blogspot.com/2011/06/perl6-2011-06-29.html

[20:20] * kthakore pokes the corspe of perl6

[20:20] <tadzik> kthakore: weird

[20:20] <masak> kthakore: you need to compile perl6 every five minutes.

[20:20] <tadzik> kthakore: how does parrot-nqp work?

[20:20] <moritz> kthakore: the compiler installs to parrot_install/bin/perl6

[20:20] <tadzik> masak: but it takes 6 minutes?

[20:20] <tadzik> s/\?//

[20:20] <masak> well, those are the breaks.

[20:30] <kthakore> dukeleto: Making rakudo compile and install to /usr/local

[20:30] <kthakore> so I can use it to install panda

[20:30] <moritz> so, in a rakudo git checkout, do:

[20:30] <kthakore> I have parrot 3.4 in /usr/local

[20:30] <kthakore> so I have to replace that first no?

[20:30] <moritz> ah

[20:30] <dukeleto> kthakore: rakudo compiles it's own parrot

[20:30] <Su-Shee> anyone in google+ yet so I can make a perl6 circle? :)

[21:10] <[Coke]> kthakore: I mean, are you sure that that perl6 is the installed copy.

[21:10] <kthakore> ...

[21:10] <kthakore> yes

[21:10] <[Coke]> (and not from the build dir.)

[21:10] <kthakore> what do you mean?

[21:10] <kthakore> how to differenciate that

[21:10] <[Coke]> and I assume you removed the build dir?

[21:10] <[Coke]> do you know what $PATH is?

[21:10] <kthakore> yes

[21:11] <[Coke]> ok. so `which perl6` will tell you which perl6 is getting run (based on your path and whatever caching your shell did.)

[21:11] <kthakore> ok

[21:12] <kthakore> which perl6 is a ln -s to my rakudo repo

[21:12] <[Coke]> or you could just run /usr/local/bin/perl6 just to be sure.

[21:30] <antony_> (not your fault)

[21:31] <masak> no, but we still feel responsible...

[21:31] <flussence> maybe prefix:<=> should be one of those things std complains about

[21:32] <thou> lichtkind: hi

[21:38] <antony_> any reason why =$fh was removed?

[21:38] <masak> yes. :)

[21:38] <flussence> it's unreadable

[21:38] <masak> it clashed with infix:<=>

[21:39] <masak> it had unworkable iterator semantics.

[21:39] <flussence> and it looks like spreadsheet code :)

[21:39] <masak> actually, in retrospect it was probably just the list/item context that was bugging us.

[21:40] <masak> turns out you can't have both list/item context polymorphism and MMD in the same language :)

[21:40] <masak> and we kinda like our MMD.

[21:41] <antony_> [I'm new in perl... coming from a python perspective]

[21:41] <masak> ooh!

[21:41] <antony_> [first I tried perl 5 but I could not bend my brain around the context rules]

[21:41] <antony_> [so I decided to take the lazy approach]

[21:41] <masak> then you'll like the absence of them in Perl 6 :)

[21:41] <antony_> [lazy is the word, indeed :p]

[21:42] <masak> blog post! http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/june-23-map-and-grep

[21:42] <antony_> more precisely I needed a function that would take hashes of hashes as argument (my easy way to implement a tree)

[21:46] <antony_> how do I do that in perl5?

[21:46] <antony_> more precisely, how can I understand where to put $/%/@?

[21:47] <antony_> (or I can just stick to 6)

[21:49] <antony_> I'm adding a leaf

[21:49] <antony_> at node specified by @list

[21:49] <masak> I'd use a class for Node.

[21:49] <antony_> in the tree rooted at %node

[21:49] <masak> then it's easy.

[21:50] <masak> rakudo: class Node { has @.children is rw }; my $n = Node.new(:children(1, 2, 3)); $n.children.push(4); say $n.children.perl

[21:52] <masak> rakudo: class Node { has $.label; has @.children is rw }; my $n = Node.new(:label("OH HAI")); say $n.label

[21:53] <antony_> thanks

[21:53] <masak> np

[21:53] <antony_> trying to read perl5 doc is like, eeerk. trying to read perl6 doc is like, wow, I may actually want to learn this :p

[21:55] <masak> cool.

[21:55] <antony_> coming back to lines

[21:56] <antony_> for $fh.lines(nl => ";")  that should, well, read until next ";" and put that in $_ (and loop) ?

[21:57] <antony_> (want to parse free form code, with logical lines delimited, well, by ";" and not by \n)

[21:57] <antony_> (because for me it still seems to break lines at "\n")

[21:58] <masak> according to S32/IO you should set $fh.input-line-separator = ";"

[21:58] <arnsholt> If your parsing code you might want to use grammars instead, though

[21:58] <antony_> what's nl good for then?

[21:58] <arnsholt> s/your/you're/

[21:59] <masak> antony_: good question. I had not seen it before.

[22:00] <masak> antony_: either it overrides the .input-line-separator setting, or (more likely) it should go away.

[22:00] <antony_> in S32/IO

[22:00] <antony_> method lines ($handle:

[22:00] <antony_> ...

[22:00] <antony_> Any  :$nl = "\n",

[22:00] <colomon> antony_: lines in rakudo definitely doesn't have the ability to change the separator. 

[22:00] <antony_> that looked pretty obvious to me when I first read it

[22:01] <benabik> Being able to specify the line ending when calling lines() seems handy to me.

[22:01] <benabik> Far more intuitive than using .input-line-separator

[22:01] <colomon> and more local, too.

[22:01] <benabik> local++

[22:01] <benabik> plusplus++

[22:02] *** lith_ left
[22:03] <masak> the people have spoken :)

[22:03] <masak> I don't like that they are called different things, though.

[22:05] <antony_> Method 'input-line-separator' not found for invocant of class 'IO'

[22:05] <antony_> not over with trouble yet :p

[22:05] <masak> oh, NYI. I forgot to mention that.

[22:05] <colomon> of course, maybe the argument against having lines all different separators is that it is pretty trivial to implement using comb or split....

[22:05] <pmichaud> > say [+] 5, 10, 12

[22:06] <antony_> colomon > not when your file is huge

[22:06] *** impious left
[22:07] <antony_> at least rakudo seems to rather dislike me s///'ing a 200000 character string in one go

[22:07] <colomon> antony_: yes, we were just discussing that drawback

[22:07] <antony_> (which I find surprising by the way)

[22:07] <benabik> We need a lazy version of slurp.

[22:07] <antony_> lol

[22:07] <antony_> I was quite surprised actually

[22:08] <antony_> as I managed to make this part work in perl5 with little trouble (probably the only one I managed to :p)

[22:09] <antony_> so what's the best way for me currently to do that?

[22:09] *** Rotwang left
[22:11] <antony_> and also, talking about NYIness

[22:11] <arnsholt> Grammars should be good bet, or perhaps split as colomon suggested (instead of s///)

[22:11] <colomon> arnsholt: it doesn't solve the "everything in memory at once" issue

[22:12] <antony_> is there a place where what's available in rakudo is explicitely specified?

[22:12] <antony_> (I'll try the split version)

[22:12] <colomon> antony_: the source code, alas.

[22:12] <pmichaud> imagine trying to document every feature that might be implemented :)

[22:12] <colomon> antony_: there's a list somewhere or other, but I seem to recall it's not terribly up-to-date

[22:12] <pmichaud> it's not exactly easy to do.

[22:13] <arnsholt> colomon: Yeah, there is that. But hopefully Grammar.parse has less overhead =)

[22:13] <antony_> sure, I understand that

[22:14] <antony_> (it's just a pain for a beginner when you don't know whether you made a mistake, whether the feature is not implemented, or... something else)

[22:14] <colomon> antony_: the good news is, you can ask here and get an answer pretty quickly usually.

[22:14] <antony_> yeah

[22:14] <antony_> I was quite surprised at the niceness of the people there :p

[22:17] <antony_> global s// (~200000 chars) and splitting around ";" => 20s; splitting (~1500 lines) and s// on each line => 15s

[22:17] <PerlJam> antony_: watch out for random hugs! :)

[22:17] <antony_> better

[22:17] <antony_> but still slow
