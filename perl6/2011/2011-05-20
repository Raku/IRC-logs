[16:07] <clintongormley1> hi all - i'm hoping that somebody with language design experience (<cough>TimToady</cough>) might give me a bit of advice

[16:07] <clintongormley1> i'm trying to design an SQL::Abstract style interface to send queries to ElasticSearch, a lucene based full text search engine

[16:09] <clintongormley1> in case you're not familiar, SQL::Abstract parses constructs like { foo=>'bar', num => { '>' => 5}}

[16:09] <clintongormley1> so there are the obvious operators, like > < != etc

[16:10] <clintongormley1> but there are a number of other query types, like 'prefix', 'fuzzy' which i'm considering allowing operators for, as opposed to saying { field => {prefix => 'foo'}}

[16:10] <clintongormley1> here is what i have: https://gist.github.com/a90fc626d4f849b41100

[16:11] <clintongormley1> and i'm wondering what you think.  do the proposed operators work? or are they too invented, and should i just stick to using words (ie 'prefix', 'wildcard' etc)

[16:11] <sorear> hello clintongormley1.

[16:11] <clintongormley1> hiya

[16:11] <sorear> who sent you here? :)

[16:11] <PerlJam> I think it's well known that this is a good place to find TimToady

[16:11] <clintongormley1> sorear: nobody. i know what #perl6 is, but i thought this was the place with the highest concentration of operator experts :)

[16:12] *** kst left
[16:12] <clintongormley1> s/operator/language/

[16:12] <clintongormley1> i realise this is OT, but hoping for some feedback anyway

[16:12] <PerlJam> Well, in your case, you don't have much of a "language" :)

[16:13] <clintongormley1> yes, i realise

[16:13] <PerlJam> I assume the | are meta-syntax in your examples.

[16:13] <clintongormley1> the > | < etc 

[16:13] <clintongormley1> yes, i mean > or < or >=

[16:13] <PerlJam> how do you say "and" and "or" ?

[16:14] <clintongormley1> in SQL::Abstract, you say it with {} or [], so:

[16:14] <clintongormley1>  { foo => bar, num => 1}  is: foo == bar and num == 1

[16:14] <PerlJam> oh.  I get it.

[16:14] <clintongormley1> in [] would be or

[16:15] <clintongormley1> i can support eg the word 'prefix' plus the op, but i'm wondering if the ops are just too unfamiliar to be useful, and would be better left out

[16:18] <PerlJam> clintongormley1: if your users are perl programmers, some of those would be analogous to regex or glob and so make sense I guess.

[16:18] <clintongormley1> any that you think work, and any that you would dismiss?

[16:18] <clintongormley1> (and yes, they are Perl users)

[16:20] <PerlJam> I'd probably use '^' for "starts with" and "*" for glob and '~' for full text search.

[16:20] <PerlJam> '~~' doesn't quite do it for me, nor does '*~'

[16:20] <PerlJam> (but that's just me)

[16:21] <PerlJam> (and you could use '$' for "ends with" if you needed it)

[16:21] <clintongormley1> yep - that one doesn't exist

[16:21] <clintongormley1> that makes sense - any idea about how to distinguish between 'text' and 'query_string' then?

[16:21] <clintongormley1> query_string is commonly used, and thus is longer than i'd like

[16:23] <PerlJam> well, maybe just "query" ?

[16:23] <clintongormley1> yeah, although that is used elsewhere 

[16:23] <clintongormley1> to distinguish between queries (which have their "relevance" scored) and filters, which just ... filter :)

[16:23] *** Trashlord joined
[16:24] <PerlJam> fuzzy and query_string both want to be text-ish rather than operator-ish in my head.  so, I'd use "fuzzy" and "query"

[16:24] <PerlJam> or perhaps "fts" for query_string

[16:25] <clintongormley1> ok - yeah that makes sense 

[16:25] <clintongormley1> thanks PerlJam

[16:26] <PerlJam> sure

[16:26] <PerlJam> clintongormley1: Can you do arithmetic on the keys? or is that planned?

[16:27] <clintongormley1> no

[16:27] <clintongormley1> neither

[16:27] <PerlJam> okay, that would make a difference to using "*" to mean glob or not

[16:27] <clintongormley1> right

[16:29] <PerlJam> in fact, to be conservative, you should use "glob" instead to allow for *-as-multiplication  in the future.

[16:29] <PerlJam> But that's your call  :)

[16:29] <clintongormley1> no, it definitely won't be an option

[16:30] <clintongormley1> following your logic of query|fuzzy what if i added 'text' in there, and made fuzzy ~

[16:31] <PerlJam> Is there a particular reason you're looking for operator-like names rather than stringy names?

[16:31] <clintongormley1> just compactness really

[16:31] <clintongormley1> that's why i wanted a sense check - afraid i was going overboard :)

[16:31] *** sftp joined
[16:31] <PerlJam> Would you have regex as an option in the future?

[16:32] <clintongormley1> it is a possibility

[16:32] <clintongormley1> right, so reserve ~ for regex

[16:32] <PerlJam> well, you could use '=~' for regex, but then ~-as-fuzzy wouldn't make as much sense

[16:32] <PerlJam> (IMHO)

[16:32] <clintongormley1> yeah

[16:33] <clintongormley1> and really, for fuzzy you have to provide a number of parameters, eg min similarity

[16:33] <clintongormley1> so making the op a short symbol is probably not worthwhile

[16:36] <PerlJam> The real design trick is to not accidently limit your future options by poor choices today.  TimToady excels at imagining the future, but he's had lots of practice I think  :)

[16:36] <clintongormley1> heh yeah 

[16:36] <PerlJam> (and made lots of mistakes ... thus #perl6 :)

[16:36] <clintongormley1> again, many thanks. you've helped a lot
