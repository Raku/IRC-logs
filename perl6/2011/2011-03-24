[01:52] <Util> donri: It works when you change `"/" but Get` to just `Get`, so I would think that the problem lies in the run-time mixin badly interacting with the signature.

[01:53] <Util> As I understand it, `$request where Get` in the signature means $request must have the *value* of Get, or at least smart-match Get.

[01:54] <Util> I don't know how you would specify that $request has to have the *property* of Get.

[01:55] <donri> Util: it worked when I made the enum without pairs

[01:55] <donri> but now that i try to make $request a custom class rather than the string, it fails :D

[07:29] <donri> question is, would changes be accepted?

[07:29] <moritz_> ask masak. But I'd think "yes"

[07:29] <donri> the GET method is also a completely wrong php-ism

[07:29] <moritz_> what does it do?

[07:30] <donri> query args

[07:30] <donri> which you can have for any http method

[07:30] <moritz_> should probably be URL-PARAMS or so

[07:30] <donri> nah, should be 'args' :)

[07:30] <moritz_> too unspecific

[07:30] <donri> or maybe 'params'

[07:30] <tadzik> or params(), like in Dancer

[07:31] <donri> what's the difference?

[07:31] <tadzik> owait, not the same

[07:43] <moritz_> I'm working on a p5 web project now, and I have unit- and regressiontests for both backend and generated HTML

[07:44] <moritz_> ideally I'd like to avoid the browser completely, which is what my other tests do so far

[07:45] <donri> lets hope for a future of js on parrot

[07:45] <moritz_> even then somebody would need to implement the DOM

[07:45] <donri> there are command-line js implementations

[15:51] <[Coke]> and I wonder how many groups, perl6 included, are thinking "wow, it must really suck in those other OSS projects..."

[15:51] <[Coke]> (moritz's smarterware url)

[15:52] <moritz_> other projects?

[15:52] <moritz_> so far I know of two designers who have invested some work in creating rakudo or perl 6 logos, and both were rather disappointed

[15:53] <moritz_> though by lack of feedback, not hostility or elitism

[15:55] <[Coke]> perlsixers, have no fear. Duke Nuke 'em release delayed again.

[15:56] <jnthn> Is it delayed because they don't have a fast enough Perl 6 implementation to run it on yet? :)

[15:56] <moritz_> jnthn: yep, waiting for 6model

[15:57] <jnthn> :P

[15:57] <jnthn> 6model is kinda here. It's just that Rakudo doesn't run on it yet. :)

[15:57] <jnthn> Mostly because along the way I decided to battle a few other issues.

[15:58] <jnthn> (All the NQP bits I'm doing at the moment are directly applicable to Rakudo too.)

[15:58] *** ymasory_ left
[15:58] <RichiH> moritz_: lack of feedback can be worse than negative feedback

[16:00] <[Coke]> jnthn: anything others can do to  help?

[16:03] <jnthn> [Coke]: One task that I will block on that is very possible for others to do is fix up "make install" for nqp, so it doesn't scribble over nqp-rx and can co-exist with it.

[16:06] <jnthn> [Coke]: The stuff I'm most actively working on at the moment is related to gradual typing and dealing with things that have lifetimes that cross the compile-time/runtime boundary. Given I'm still understanding the space myself as I implement stuff, I'm finding it hard to know how to draw others in to working on that. Once that is done and the Rakudo on 6model work starts proper, I expect plenty of LHF.

[16:11] <moritz_> RichiH: I know. I've tried to give feedback to both, but it wasn't as much as they hoped for

[16:14] *** Trashlord joined
[16:18] <RichiH> ++ for trying :)

[16:23] <TimToady> well, it's a bit hard when "not exactly what we were looking for" is not exactly what they want to hear...  :)

[16:24] * jnthn 's compiler presentation has 42 slides now, but he's pretty sure the answer isn't "stop now, it's done" :)

[16:24] <jnthn> Alas, 'tis late here.

[16:24] <jnthn> sleep & :)

[16:25] <moritz_> sleep well jnthn 

[16:25] <TimToady> there's lots of really good design out there, but any particular slot can only be filled by a single design; the best thing we can do to attract designers is to invent new slots that need designs

[16:25] <jnthn> moritz_: Thanks...I'm doing amazingly well at that so far. I feared the jetlag would be a mess...

[16:25] <jnthn> ...but so far I'm coping OK. :)

[16:25] <PerlJam> I thought sri got plenty of feedback, just that it didn't happen right away and that it wasn't "wow, we could use that!"

[16:27] <__sri> PerlJam: not useful feedback

[16:28] <__sri> the point is i could have drawn anything, and was looking for direction here

[16:28] <PerlJam> __sri: oh.   Make it look more like Camelia  :)

[16:28] <TimToady> now be nice

[16:29] <TimToady> __sri++'s designs are beautiful, and should go on some perl6.* sites, just I don't think it's right for perl6.org particularly

[16:29] <__sri> i basically came with the wrong assumptions

[16:29] <TimToady> we were already tired of fighting the mascot wars by then :)

[16:31] <PerlJam> A butterfly sitting on an onion could make some nice imagry only I think people would get the wrong idea.

[16:31] <TimToady> and I think the .org site should reflect the mascot; other sites can be more logo-esque, particularly more commercially oriented sites, when we get 'em

[16:31] * moritz_ wonders if modules.perl6.org should have a whole swarm of small butterflies :-)

[16:31] <PerlJam> TimToady: I like your optimism! 

[16:31] <__sri> open source design work is very thankless and unrewarding, glad i tried it but learned the lesson

[16:31] <PerlJam> moritz +1

[16:32] <PerlJam> __sri: I think artistry is rarely rewarding except in the sense of personal accomplishment.

[16:34] <__sri> yea, the gain of design is mostly monetary

[16:35] <PerlJam> hmm .... I wonder if TPF would give a grant for logo designs  (I doubt it)

[16:35] <PerlJam> Certainly there's been much more talk about "marketing perl" though, so maybe people would go for it.

[16:36] <PerlJam> by people, I mean TPF

[16:36] <moritz_> there was an interesting hackernews discussion on how to attract designers

[16:36] <moritz_> maybe I can dig up the link

[16:36] <PerlJam> moritz_: It probably starts with "be nice; give hugs"  :)

[16:36] <__sri> moritz_: that discussion was good

[16:37] <__sri> the bottom line was that it is much easier for hackers to profit from open source than for designers

[16:37] <__sri> there is much truth to it

[16:38] <moritz_> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2267861 finally found it

[16:39] <__sri> or who here knows the name of an open source projects logo designer? ;)

[16:39] * moritz_ knows one

[16:41] <__sri> and that's pretty much the only incentive there is for designers ;p

[16:41] <PerlJam> At work I'm in the position of knowing that I need a designer (for the website), but not knowing how to find one that can meet my needs.

[16:42] <moritz_> __sri: how many open source programmers does the average designer know?

[16:43] <__sri> how many open source designers does the average designer know? :D

[16:43] <donri> how many designers with real knowledge of usability does the average open source programmer know?

[16:43] <__sri> design and ux are related but not the same

[16:43] <donri> IME designers are either programmers themselves or photoshoptards who think everything-is-an-image-or-even-flash is awsumlulz

[16:44] <donri> Hopefully I only lack experience with good designers

[16:44] <PerlJam> donri: that's pretty close to my experience as well.

[16:44] <__sri> there are really good ones like hicks that can do both

[16:44] <donri> "If it looks good (on my screen, in my single browser (if even)) it is good."

[16:45] <__sri> http://hicksdesign.co.uk # did most of the opera ui, firefox logo...

[16:46] <moritz_> that looks nice

[16:46] <donri> and s/he does no programming?

[16:46] <__sri> none at all

[16:46] <donri> intrusting

[16:46] <moritz_> and also w3 compliant, except for one stupid typo :-)

[16:47] <PerlJam> __sri: funny, I looked at http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/  and immediately thought of you.  :)

[16:47] <PerlJam> "made of unicorns"

[16:47] <__sri> heh

[16:47] <donri> Generally though I think you have to understand the technology if you're designing for the web/computers

[16:47] <donri> Even if you don't actually do backend devel

[16:48] <TimToady> that's an oversimplification, I think

[16:48] <TimToady> there are many layers

[16:48] <donri> 'course

[16:48] <PerlJam> donri: only somewhat.  If they can mentall separate "content" from "design" that may be good enough.

[16:48] <moritz_> you can understand the technology (to a good degree) without doing any programming

[16:48] <TimToady> and camelia is intended to be a relatively low layer in the food chain

[16:48] <donri> moritz_: in deed, that was my point

[16:49] <TimToady> there's not much visual design that can be directly associated with a language

[16:49] <TimToady> but surrounding services open up many more design opportunities

[16:49] <donri> The main issue I think is that you're designing for a non-static medium if you're not doing print

[16:50] <__sri> i do agree that programmers with a sense for ux can be very valuable though

[16:51] <moritz_> so far I had some good success here by offering a valuable service with terrible design to the great #perl6 folks, and then somebody came up with a much improved design for me :-)

[16:51] <moritz_> success by delegation

[16:51] <donri> also, sorry, i jumped in in the middle of your conversation here and have no idea about the actual context :)

[16:52] * PerlJam wishes someone else would redesign the look for the Perl 6 Advent calendar.

[16:52] <TimToady> donri: life is like that all over

[17:05] <TimToady> mailchimp is cute

[17:08] * moritz_ has a certain aversion against everything that has the faint smell of HTML emails

[17:08] *** dsp_ left
[17:09] <PerlJam> What's Camelia's scientific name?  something like Lepidoptera Bactrianus  ?

[17:09] * PerlJam doesn't remember if the Perl camel was a dromedary or and bactrian actually

[18:48] <masak> oh hai zebras

[18:48] <phenny> masak: 02:28Z <sorear> tell masak I think 'my $!spleen' is ETOOMUCHMAGIC and have no plans to implement it at this time.  I may be persuaded by a rise in demand.

[18:48] <phenny> masak: 10:24Z <tadzik> tell masak I fixed most of the Web.pm, it compiles and mostly works, it's down to some failing tests in Hitomi due to <?after> not being implemented. See the commits here: https://github.com/tadzik/web/commits/master

[18:49] <masak> sorear: demand's probably pretty low.

[18:49] <masak> tadzik++!

[18:49] <tadzik> oh hai Carl

[18:50] <tadzik> I thought I have a workaround for this <!after>, but the tests were failing anyway, so I didn't commit it :)

[18:50] <PerlJam> <?after> isn't implemented?

[18:50] <tadzik> nah

[18:50] <PerlJam> odd, I thought it was for some reason

[18:51] <moritz_> it was in alpha

[18:51] <moritz_> master only has <?before>

[18:52] <PerlJam> oh, that's probably why I thought it was implemented

[19:20] <masak> PerlJam: <?after> is a bit non-trivial to implement.

[19:23] <moritz_> but often you can work around its absence

[19:26] * PerlJam is so used to seeing "non-trivial" as a euphemism for "freaking impossible" that it took a few seconds to realize that masak really did mean "non-trivial"  :)

[19:29] *** aesop joined
[19:29] <masak> PerlJam: it's fairly clear how to do it, but it requires a bit of work.

[19:31] <masak> tadzik: Ratel is Tene's baby, so it's possible he's interested in hearing about failures.

[19:31] <masak> tadzik: also, maybe this'll help make finish up the Web.pm grant -- for which, if so, I'm immensely grateful. :)

[19:32] <slavik1> please vote for Comcast :)

[19:33] <masak> tadzik: I know mberends has been involved in porting, or thinking about porting, Dancer to Perl 6.

[19:34] <tadzik> masak: yeah, I know. I think HTTP::Server::Simple was the first stef

[20:03] *** MayDaniel left
[20:08] <Tene> tadzik: It's not that I dislike it, just that there's not much there to love.  It's the simplest thing that could possibly work, and I expect it's about the same as most anyone would implement a templating library of that style.

[20:08] <Tene> tadzik: I personally don't like that style of templating, but I know enough people that do that I wanted to make sure it was available.

[20:09] <Tene> tadzik: It's super short and should be pretty trivial to fix up.  You should be able to remove the use of eval on line 27 and just use a normal regex there.

[20:09] <Tene> I don't know if .subst has changed since alpha days

[21:21] *** plainhao left
[21:24] <mberends> moritz_: GSOC is a nice idea, but immediately a few worries come to mind: 1. 6model itself is not big or complete enough to provide precise goals, 2. if I might mentor it, I would want to know more about how the result should look (need jnthn++) 3. there is a high probability of a time overrun.

[21:26] <mberends> How negative that looks, not what I intended. Most important - GSOC would be very welcome, and the problems can be dealt with!
