[13:49] <newguy> I have downloaded and installed Rakudo on my Vista computer. How do I "compile" a .pl file?

[13:51] <newguy> > perl6 samtest.pl Could not find sub &samtest

[13:52] <newguy> I am using the perl6.exe black window to do this?

[13:52] <moritz> nope

[13:52] <moritz> start a command window

[13:52] <newguy> msdos?

[13:53] <moritz> yes

[13:53] <moritz> or you can associate .pl files with the perl6 binary

[13:53] <moritz> then you can just double-click the file in the windows explorer

[13:54] <PerlJam> newguy: What is your intent in learning Perl 6?  Just for fun?

[17:08] <masak> moritz++

[17:08] <moritz> newguy: the .close is important, otherwise the file might not get written at all

[17:08] <moritz> (which is a bug in rakudo, but one that's not easily fixed)

[17:09] <masak> there are no guarantees for timely DESTROY, or even that DESTROY is called at all.

[17:09] <moritz> not a good language for world destruction :-)

[17:10] <newguy> moritz: so i need to define variable $file above that line right?

[17:10] <moritz> newguy: no, just $filename

[17:11] <moritz> or just use a literal string there

[17:11] <sorear> Why isn't the hash sigil #?

[17:11] <newguy> moritz: ok will try now

[17:11] <moritz> the 'my' already declares the $file variable

[17:11] <moritz> sorear: because that's for comments :-)

[17:11] <masak> my $file = open('README', :w);

[17:11] <moritz> NOOO

[17:11] <moritz> don't override the README file! :-)

[17:11] <sorear> I've seen other characters besides # used for comments

[17:11] <masak> no-one reads it anyway :P

[17:11] <newguy> moritz: so what would be the file name that is created in my directory?

[17:12] <moritz> newguy: if you have  my $filename = 'output.txt';  the the file will be called output.txt

[17:12] <sorear> #, %, *, \, ", ', ;, : I think are all the end-of-line comment chars I've seen

[17:14] <moritz> sorear: I think the mapping from symbol to meaning is primarily historical, and less bound to the name of the symbol

[17:14] <moritz> .u zip

[17:14] <phenny> U+A290 YI SYLLABLE ZIP (ꊐ)

[17:14] <moritz> we could use that instead of infix:<Z>

[17:14] <moritz> people would hate us :-)

[17:14] <moritz> I mean, more than they do now :-)

[17:15] <tadzik> I just imagined like 10 yrs ago people thought "we can use » instead of >>... but no, people will hate us" :)

[17:16] <masak> 10 yrs later... they do :)

[17:16] <newguy> moritz: It works... now i need to learn how to manipulate text

[17:17] <masak> newguy: that's the fun part! :)

[17:17] <masak> newguy: Perl is very good at manipulating text.

[17:18] <newguy> moritz: I am network administrator.  I will be using this to create script files that get applied to routers on a WAN

[17:18] <sorear> tadzik: ~10 years ago Perl 6 was much more APLy

[17:20] <tadzik> sorear: APLy?

[17:20] <masak> really?

[17:20] <masak> we've gotten *more* metaops since then.

[17:24] <masak> I'd say 10 years ago, Perl 6 was a lot more like Perl 5.

[17:28] <sorear> AIUI, early Perl 6 relied on Unicode operators for a lot of stuff

[17:29] <masak> oh, that's what you meant. yes.

[17:29] <masak> there was the yen symbol for zipping, for example.

[17:29] *** ymasory_ left
[17:29] <masak> but you could also use a 'Y', I think.

[17:30] <sorear> how would that interact with unspace?

[17:30] *** cdarroch joined
[17:30] *** cdarroch left
[17:30] *** cdarroch joined
[17:30] <sorear> aren't the yen and backslash encoded ambiguously in a lot of Japanese encodigng?

[17:30] <masak> not sure how that'd work out.

[17:31] *** newguy left
[17:33] <PerlJam> masak: 10 years ago Perl 6 was a lot more like Perl 5 ....  along which axes?  ;)

[17:33] <masak> PerlJam: syntax-wise, for example.

[17:34] <masak> PerlJam: also the terminology was a lot more alike.

[17:34] <masak> PerlJam: look at E03, which ends by stating how little you need to change for it to be valid Perl 6.

[17:34] <masak> might've been E02, I don't remember.

[17:34] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[17:34] <masak> it's something like "96% similar!"

[17:35] <PerlJam> I think I agree.

[17:35] <PerlJam> aside from the Regex revamp, Perl 6 was a lot like Perl 5 back then

[17:35] <masak> ...which makes sense, of course.

[17:36] <PerlJam> and if you compare Perl 6 then with Perl 5 *now*  they were even *more* similar

[17:36] <moritz> modulo sigl invariance

[17:36] <masak> :)

[17:37] <masak> 24 minutes to #cqrs-perl6. feel free to drop in.

[17:37] <PerlJam> So ... Perl 5 is slowly evolving into Perl 6, it's just 10-20 years behind the state-of-the-art

[17:41] <masak> PerlJam: big words from a language whose most featureful implementation is 1e2-1e4 slower than Perl 5 :)

[17:41] <PerlJam> That's just an implementation detail.

[17:41] <PerlJam> :)

[17:43] <masak> ...they cheerfully declared, and set of on their long road to obscurity and obsolesence... :)

[17:59] <moritz> great

[17:59] <patrickas> but I keep forgetting the thingy that triggers a mail to RT when I add tests :(

[18:00] <moritz> the mailer might be sleeping

[18:37] <tadzik> try \r\n or something

[18:40] <PerlJam> tadzik: \n is still a logical newline I think, so it should work no matter the OS

[18:41] <tadzik> dunno

[18:41] <newguy> thanks. this works $file.say("new line1\r\nline2"); $file.close

[18:41] <PerlJam> interesting.

[20:16] <masak> hi rindolf.

[20:16] <rindolf> masak: what's up?

[20:16] <masak> giving a course :)

[20:16] <masak> rindolf: and you?

[20:16] <rindolf> masak: checking Twitter.

[20:17] <rindolf> masak: worked on http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/version-3/ today (Please don't print.)

[20:17] <masak> :)

[20:18] <rindolf> masak: and I published http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/human-hacking-field-guide-v2/

[20:19] <rindolf> masak: which course are you giving?

[20:19] <masak> rindolf: #cqrs-perl6.

[20:19] <masak> rindolf: it's almost over. been at it for 2.5 hours now.

[20:20] <rindolf> masak: what is CQRS?

[20:22] *** bluescreen10 left
[20:22] <masak> rindolf: that's what I'm trying to convey in the course :)

[20:22] <masak> rindolf: you can backlog that channel if you like.

[20:22] <rindolf> masak: :-S

[20:23] <masak> rindolf: it's *because* it's non-trivial to explain that I'm holding the course :)

[20:25] <moritz> rindolf: it's basically an architecture style where you separate commands to a backend from their responsens
