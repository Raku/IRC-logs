[05:24] <sorear> cotto: a select op would also be an option

[05:24] <cotto> sorear, it would.  We already have a dynpmc, but I'm not a fan of the interface.

[05:24] <sorear> cotto: rakudo can't generally use dynpmcs as is (limitations in HLL mapping?); there will be a wrapper regardless of what you offer

[05:24] *** wamba joined
[05:25] <cotto> sorear, sure.  I would like to know what would require the least wrapping.

[05:25] <cotto> i.e. what'd be a nice natural interface

[05:25] <sorear> do we want the OS dependancies to exist at the Parrot level or the Rakudo level?

[05:26] <sorear> do we want bare bindings to select, poll, epoll, kqueue, etc, or a single unified AIO system?

[05:26] <cotto> That sounds like a Rakudo decision.

[05:26] <cotto> but it's also important to figure out what Parrot wants to provide.

[05:27] <sorear> right; I'm sort of asking everyone

[05:27] *** alester left
[05:28] <sorear> it might make sense to offer both low-level bindings and a MultiIO.nqp library 

[05:29] <sorear> that way HLLs that need to offer select can do so

[05:29] <sorear> OTOH, I've been told that Parrot has no interest in providing direct POSIX bindings

[05:30] <cotto> I don't remember such a discussion, but it sounds plausible.

[05:30] <cotto> maybe I do.

[05:32] <cotto> The nice thing about Select as a dynpmc is that we have code for it now.

[08:13] <cognominal> The sentence is a pangram that contains all the accentuated chars known to french.

[08:13] <cognominal> well, that the definition of a pangram.

[08:15] <cognominal> To be true, the definition of pangram is silent about the presence of ligatures and accentuated chars.

[08:16] <cognominal> Also there are ligatures that are optional like for word with ff

[08:17] <moritz> cognominal: I understand sorear's question differently: are there any ligatures which are written as two characters, but treated as one in French?

[08:28] <cognominal> Many people write boeuf or caetera because they don't know to do a ligature with a keyboard. But if I see these ligatures in the keyboard visualizer when holding the ‚å• key on my mac. Anyway they are so rare that mot people ignore them.

[08:29] <moritz> but there are also cases where 'eu' doesn't stand for the ligature, right?

[08:32] <cognominal> indeed. Like in "il a eu peur"

[08:33] <moritz> phenny: fr "eu"?

[08:33] <phenny> moritz: "had" (fr to en, translate.google.com)

[08:33] * moritz had his last french lessons a decade ago

[08:34] <moritz> considering that I had basically no practise, it's amazing how much written French text I can still read

[08:34] <cognominal> But the ligature in b≈ìuf is in oe.

[08:34] <moritz> oh

[08:34] <moritz> (listening to French is no good, those people just always talk way too fast)

[08:35] <cognominal> I will check antidote, may be the ligature is facultative now.

[08:37] <cognominal> I feel  antidote is the best  french dictionary, done in Qu√©bec, available on mac, pc and iDevices

[08:43] <cognominal> personally, I have never seen before the form "curiculum vit√¶" mentionned by antidote.

[13:50] * pmichaud decides to rename "rakbench" to "rpmark"

[13:51] <PerlJam> rpm ark?  rp mark? r pm ark?   :)

[13:51] <pmichaud> "Rakudo/Parrot benchmarks"

[13:51] <pmichaud> and yes, there are other possibilities for it as well :)

[13:51] <moritz> use rpbench instead

[13:52] <pmichaud> yeah, I thought of that too.

[13:52] <moritz> "bench" is easier to map to "benchmark" than "mark"

[13:52] <pmichaud> well, "mark" is what we produce.  :-)

[13:52] <isBEKaml> r pm ark, sounds a lot gruff. :-)

[13:52] <isBEKaml> har har har

[13:52] *** leprevost joined
[13:53] <pmichaud> also, I want to preserve the possibility that it'll be used for more than just benchmarking Rakudo :)

[13:53] <pmichaud> "rp" gives a few more options

[13:53] <ggoebel> moritz: yes... quoted slightly out of context. I hope 6model fits best. Purpose of mentioning it was to try to connect jnth to lucian if that connection doesn't already exist

[13:53] <pmichaud> I'll decide between rpmark and rpbench in a bit.  votes welcome :)

[13:53] <pmichaud> bbiab

[13:56] <isBEKaml> speaking about benchmarks, I vaguely remember util/colomon working on their own benchmarks. Is that still on? 

[13:56] <isBEKaml> colomon: ^^

[14:12] <pmichaud> isBEKaml: yes, those are in perl6/bench-scripts

[14:12] <pmichaud> I'm copying many of those scripts (as appropriate) into rpmark

[14:13] * pmichaud still on fence between "rpmark" and "rpbench"  (or even something else entirely)

[14:14] <JimmyZ_> +1 to rpbench

[14:14] <pmichaud> maybe I should call them "onions"... because so far when I open them up, they make me cry.  1/2 :-)

[14:14] <JimmyZ_> I don't know what does mark mean 

[14:15] <isBEKaml> pmichaud: oh, thanks. 

[14:17] <isBEKaml> pmichaud: +1 to rpbench

[14:17] <isBEKaml> JimmyZ_: mark as in bench_mark_

[14:17] <isBEKaml> :)

[14:18] *** daxim joined
[14:19] <JimmyZ_> isBEKaml:  yes, but it does not give me that impression

[14:21] <isBEKaml> JimmyZ_: yes, I guess that's part of the reason we both voted for rpbench. :)

[14:21] <JimmyZ_> yeah

[14:23] <PerlJam> pmichaud: I vote rpbench btw.   Makes me think of "bench testing" and such

[14:23] <pmichaud> wfm

[14:32] <pmichaud> speed.pypy.org uses geometric mean (of a suite of tests) to compare pypy against other python implementations.  is geometric mean a good calculation to use for a "composite index" like this?

[14:33] <pmichaud> i.e., if I wanted to come up with an overall comparison of one build versus another... would geometric mean of the benchmark times of each work?

[14:34] *** BaggioKwok left
[14:35] <PerlJam> I looked at speed.pypy.org and really I have no idea what their overall speed score really *means*

[14:35] <colomon> my first naive thought would be arithmetic mean of the percentage difference?  I'm not sure why geometric mean might be preferred.  

[14:35] <PerlJam> It didn't look like it was tied in any way to the importance of the feature being tested

[14:35] <colomon> +1

[14:35] <pmichaud> I'm pretty sure arithmetic mean of percentage won't be quite right

[14:36] <pmichaud> PerlJam: my guess on speed.pypy.org is this:  consider the first two benchmarks -- they have speeds that are .65 and .07 of cpython

[14:36] <pmichaud> so to find "how much better is pypy than cpython", report the geometric mean of the two

[14:38] <pmichaud> although since geometric means are always less than arithmetic means... there might be a bias there

[14:39] <PerlJam> pmichaud: but better at *what*?  It presupposes that the benchmarks adequately measure the speed of "important" things and doesn't unduly consider the speed of "unimportant" things

[14:39] <pmichaud> PerlJam: that's outside the scope of what I'm trying to do

[14:39] <colomon> "The geometric mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean for describing proportional growth..." sounds like an argument for percentages and geometric mean.

[14:40] <pmichaud> the number just needs to say "on this set of benchmarks, build A did X factor better than build B"

[14:40] <pmichaud> I'm not trying to make larger claims about the overall improvement

[14:41] *** koban left
[14:42] <pmichaud> I'll go with geometric mean of the percentages for now

[14:42] <pmichaud> thanks

[20:32] <flussence> ooh, someone's making a bash script parsing library for GSoC. The fun I could have with that...

[20:32] <sbp> link?

[20:33] <flussence> http://dev.gentoo.org/~qiaomuf/libbash.html

[20:33] <sbp> thanks!

[20:33] *** miyagawa left
[20:40] <moritz> what's wrong with the parser in bash?

[20:41] <moritz> bash has the -n option for syntax checking, so it can surely parse without executing

[20:42] *** mj41 left
[20:43] <flussence> I think the main reason for this as a library is for embedding in gentoo's package management stuff, because it saves a few hundred forks that way

[20:43] <flussence> (all the packages are bash scripts, more or less)

[20:45] *** benabik left
[20:46] <moritz> and it only needs to parse (and not execute) them=

[20:46] <moritz> s/=/?/

[20:46] *** thou left
[20:47] <flussence> IIRC, the package format spec says external commands are only allowed in a few specific places, all the metadata should be plain bash syntax

[20:48] <flussence> (not that people always follow the spec...)

[20:48] <moritz> that's close to the borderline between genious and insanity, or something

[20:49] <flussence> nah, it's a few light years from that line :)

[20:49] <moritz> on which side? :-)

[20:50] <flussence> well, people have forked the distro more than once over the state of this stuff, so... :)
