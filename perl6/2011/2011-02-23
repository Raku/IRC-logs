[00:18] <diakopter> timeout on 1690?

[00:18] *** molaf left
[00:18] <diakopter> (1691 I mean)

[00:21] <Tene> phenny: ask jnthn if I should expect to need to write my own repr for cardinal, or if I should be able to get by on P6opaque at first.

[00:21] <phenny> Tene: I'll pass that on when jnthn is around.

[00:21] <Tene> phenny: thanks; you're very helpful

[00:21] <donri> p6opaque mo?

[00:22] *** ponbiki joined
[00:25] *** MayDaniel left
[00:27] <Tene> donri: The Perl 6 specification includes representation polymorphism.  You should be able to use objects mostly without caring about how they're actually represented in memory, and various ways in which you should be able to indicate what sort of memory representation you want.  P6opaque is the primary representation used for objects in the nom refactor of rakudo.

[00:29] <Tene> donri: The traditional example of representation polymorphism is packing of native types.  If you have "my int @foo[10];", where the lowercase "int" indicates a native type instead of the Perl 6 class Int, you should be able to represent the storage of that array with a contiguous hunk of memory the length of 10 native ints

[00:29] *** jtbraun1 left
[00:29] <Tene> Instead of having a separate container, attributes, separate storage, etc. for each int object

[00:30] <Tene> donri: Similarly, P6object should be able to inline attributes of native types in arbitrary classes.

[00:32] <Tene> donri: Does that sufficiently satisfy your curiosity?

[00:33] <Tene> donri: I'm trying to use 6model (the object model being developed for the nom refactor of rakudo) for Cardinal, the Ruby compiler that treed and I have worked on.

[00:33] <donri> but do you get an int or an Int?

[00:33] <Tene> donri: I'm sorry?  I need more context for that question.

[00:33] <donri> my int @foo

[00:34] <Tene> Right, but what about it?  That's an array that stores ints.

[00:34] <donri> i guess that's what you meant with the "use without caring about repr"

[00:35] <donri> that you can use these ints as Ints

[00:35] <donri> but why would Int need more storage than ints?

[00:37] <diakopter> b/c the runtime needs to know the type of scalars that are boxed

[00:37] <Tene> donri: a few things... Int is unsized, and can hold arbitrarily-large values, etc.

[00:38] <donri> ah

[00:38] *** envi joined
[00:38] *** rdesfo joined
[00:38] <Tene> Using int as a type annotation tells Perl 6 that it can do optimization to hold only that much, and that it's a value type, so the details can all be optimized out, etc.

[08:37] <moritz_> well, if all the tests in split-simple2.t are also in split-simple.t, and all implementations (ie rakudo and niecza) run both files successfully, then yes

[14:41] <moritz_> JimmyZ: if you 'git pull --rebase' you can avoid those unneeded merge commits

[14:41] <JimmyZ> moritz_: ok, thanks.

[14:41] <JimmyZ> I hate it too.

[14:43] <benabik> Rebasing is your friend.  I use it _constantly_.  Awesome for making your commits look perfect before anyone else see them.  :-D

[14:43] <moritz_> aka "good cheating"

[14:43] *** kanishka joined
[14:43] <benabik> You just have to remember not to rebase anything you've pushed out.  That's not so friendly.

[14:43] * JimmyZ wonders why --rebase is not default.

[14:43] *** bluescreen left
[14:44] <donri> mathw: not giving up on perl 6, i know rakudo and parrot haven't had much optimizations done and this is an expensive problem

[14:44] <mathw> :)

[14:44] <benabik> JimmyZ: Because rebasing is very evil for already pushed branches.

[14:45] <benabik> JimmyZ: Although you can make it default for you:  'git config --global branch.autosetuprebase true'

[14:45] <benabik> JimmyZ: (Leaving off --global will make it default only for the current repo.)

[14:45] <mathw> Because git supports many many workflows, and some of them break horribly if you rebase in the wrong places

[14:46] <JimmyZ> can't automatic rebase when it's needed?

[14:47] <benabik> Git defaults to the safe option.  Altering history is cheating and is not guaranteed to give you back exactly what you put in.

[14:49] <benabik> Also, if anyone has made commits on top of the ones you're rebasing, they can have a real problem syncing back up.

[20:50] <masak> nice! people took up the mini-challenge :)

[20:50] <masak> colomon++

[20:53] <tadzik> question: Rakudo is written in Perl 6. What happens when we lose the first compiler? :)

[20:54] <masak> we'll just use the second?

[20:54] <tadzik> I mean, when we run out of the working compilers, what will we do?

[20:54] *** jferrero joined
[20:55] <masak> the question seems to ignore that the compilers usually build themselves via bootstrapping from smaller languages such as nqp.

[20:55] <Tene> Anyone know if there's a specific reason that the spec doesn't define some of the more-obvious unicode math ops, like ‚â† ?

[20:55] <Tene> I mean, it's obviously not completely adverse to unicode, what with ¬´¬ª etc.

[20:55] <masak> Tene: the spec doesn't define any ops outside of latin-1.

[20:56] *** mtk left
[20:56] <tadzik> masak: so when Rakudo builds, it first builds some part of itself using nqp, and then builds the Rakudo-Rakudo?

[20:56] <masak> yes.

[20:57] <masak> similarly, nqp-rx bootstraps itself from PGE, which is written in PIR.

[20:58] <masak> so it's something like Parrot -> PIR/IMCC -> PGE -> nqp/rx -> Rakudo -> Rakudo's setting.

[20:59] <masak> hm, the first 'Rakudo' could say 'Rakudo grammar/actions'

[20:59] <[Coke]> masak: It's all so simple!

[20:59] <masak> [Coke]: :)

[21:00] *** Axius left
[21:02] <masak> diakopter: huh. I didn't look at the Java solution before posting my challenge, but it's nice to see it (and your solution) corresponds to my idea.

[21:02] <masak> nice premature optimization on the bitshift :P

[21:04] <Tene> masak: these days, nqp bootstraps itself with nqp

[21:04] *** mtk joined
[21:04] <Tene> masak: there's a compiled-to-pir version of nqp that's built and shipped with parrot, the stage0 compiler

[21:07] <masak> right. that's the one I was thinking of.

[21:08] <masak> I'm actually not entirely sure what the role of the stage0 compiler is. I just assumed it was used to build nqp-rx the first time around.

[21:09] <masak> I meant to start writing the p5 post tonight, but I'm too exhausted after $dayjob. hopefully tomorrow night.

[21:12] <masak> colomon: your solution uses lazy lists, whereas the mini-challenge was to write a version without them. did I miss something? :)

[21:12] <colomon> moritz_: (re roast commit bit for jdhore) I always forget I can do that!

[21:12] <colomon> masak: A) was ignoring your challenge

[21:12] <colomon> masak: B) actually, my core code does NOT use lazy lists.

[21:12] <jdhore> :D

[21:13] <colomon> The sorted-merge function takes care to allow lazy lists, but the hamming function never uses them.

[21:13] <masak> colomon: oh, I saw gather/take and assumed it did. sorry 'bout that :)

[21:17] <Tene> Shame we don't have lazy junctions.  That should be easy to implement.

[21:18] <colomon> Tene: tomorrow would be plenty fast enough, I'm sure.  ;)

[21:20] <Tene> colomon: First I'd have to read the spec pretty thoroughly to make sure it's permitted.

[21:20] *** mberends_ left
[21:20] <Tene> Our current impl explicitly calls .eager.

[21:21] <Tene> I don't know if there's a good reason to do that or not.

[21:21] <p6eval> rakudo 58e40e: OUTPUT¬´any(Bool::False, Bool::True)‚ê§¬ª

[21:21] <colomon> I wouldn't be surprised if it's not permitted, actually.

[21:22] <Tene> Why?

[21:22] <moritz_> well, it can short-circuit as soon as the answer is determined

[21:22] <Tene> Exactly why I expected it to work lazily, moritz

[21:22] <moritz_> ie at least one True for an any() junction, at least one false for a none() junction etc.

[23:05] *** ab5tract left
[23:05] <donaldh> I've simplified the example. It was based on: sub sqlite3_open( Str $filename, OpaquePointer $ppDB is rw )

[23:07] <donaldh> I'm trying to extend Zavolaj to initialize out parameters, i.e. those marked is rw.

[23:11] *** kst` is now known as kst

[23:11] <donri> but i'd think you'd usually write a wrapper api on top of the nativecalls

[23:12] <donaldh> Currently I have to do this: my $db = pir::new__Ps('UnManagedStruct'); my $status = sqlite3_open( "test.db", $db );

[23:13] <donaldh> I want to avoid having to initialize $db by embedding that behaviour in Zavolaj.

[23:13] <donaldh> donri: https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj/

[23:16] <donri> oh zavolaj *is* nativecall?

[23:16] <donri> i thought it was sqlite3 via nativecall

[23:16] <donaldh> Yes.

[23:16] <donri> http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/day-15-calling-native-libraries-from-perl-6/

[23:16] <donri> suggests wrapper api

[23:20] <donaldh> perhaps that's the only viable approach.

[23:21] <donri> i think the whole point of the "is native" subs is to represent the functions in natural perl

[23:21] <donri> it needs that information to even work, at least without .h files

[23:23] *** jaldhar left
[23:23] <donaldh> Yes, that's right. "is native" is a multi trait that is implemented to do some high magic.

[23:23] *** jaldhar joined
[23:24] <donaldh> I have extended it to understand "is rw" parameters and generate the necessary NCI call signatures.

[23:26] <donaldh> I would like it to 'autovivify' the "is rw" out parameters, but all I have to work with is an immutable capture.
