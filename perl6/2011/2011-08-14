[03:09] <soh_cah_toa> when is nom gonna be merged into master? it's soon, right?

[03:10] <sorear> real soon

[03:10] <sorear> if nothing unexpected happenes, 11.08 will be nom-bases

[03:12] <soh_cah_toa> good

[03:14] <soh_cah_toa> and what the heck? why is Configure.pl (on nom branch) telling me that i don't have nqp? even if i use --with-nqp, i get an exception. nom doesn't build w/ parrot-nqp?

[03:14] <sorear> correct

[03:14] <soh_cah_toa> agh

[03:14] *** kboga left
[03:14] <sorear> nom requires nqp-nom

[03:14] <sorear> parrot-nqp is nqp-rx

[03:15] <soh_cah_toa> oh, what's different in nqp-nom?

[03:15] <sorear> more or less everything

[03:15] <sorear> nqp-rx is a thin layer over Parrot with Perl syntax; nqp-nom is a VM abstraction layer

[03:16] <sorear> nqp-nom has definite semantics for objects, primitive types, arithmetic, multiple dispatch, etc

[03:16] <sorear> nqp-rx delegates all that to Parrot

[03:16] <soh_cah_toa> ah neat

[03:16] <soh_cah_toa> can i create hashes w/o using hash() now? ;)

[03:16] <sorear> probably now

[03:16] <sorear> not

[03:17] <soh_cah_toa> egh

[03:17] <soh_cah_toa> well anyway, where's the source for nqp-nom? i need to install it

[03:17] <sorear> one thing that hasn't changed is that nqp wants simplified syntax

[03:17] <sorear> I think it's on github somewhere, too lazy to look, --gen-nqp will DTRT

[03:18] *** woosley joined
[03:18] <soh_cah_toa> well, i can't find it on github but i'll try --gen-nqp

[03:55] <pmichaud> nqp is http://github.com/perl6/nqp

[03:55] <soh_cah_toa> yup, i found it

[03:55] <pmichaud> (good morning, #perl6)

[03:56] <pmichaud> in nqp (-nom), one can create hashes using nqp::hash(...)

[03:56] <pmichaud> so far it only understands key, value, pairs... but eventually it'll also support the named syntax.

[03:56] <soh_cah_toa> ok

[03:56] <pmichaud> as well as being able to interpolate arrays and other hashes

[03:57] <soh_cah_toa> is it just me or does nom take *a lot* longer to build than master?

[03:57] <pmichaud> it's currently taking a lot longer, yes.

[03:57] <pmichaud> I finally got a good benchmark on it yesterday, and jnthn and I aren't quite sure why it's so much longer

[03:58] <pmichaud> as soon as we get the features for nom->master in place I'll undoubtedly start looking for the reasons for the slowdown

[03:58] <soh_cah_toa> great

[03:59] <pmichaud> I think the current plan is that nom will become master on Tuesday.

[03:59] <soh_cah_toa> :D

[03:59] <pmichaud> and we'll issue the 2011.08 release of Rakudo (nom-based) on Wednesday.

[03:59] <soh_cah_toa> very awesome

[04:07] <soh_cah_toa> i suppose if they're related i should just use an enum anyway

[07:32] <tadzik> You attach a .WHY to a Sub object, and then you get "Method .WHY not found for invocant of class NQPLexPad"

[07:33] <tadzik> or CallContext, depending on the memory layout

[07:33] <tadzik> or a full-blown segfault ;)

[07:37] <cotto> Which restaurants are good around here?

[07:40] <masak> cotto: what type food?

[07:41] <cotto> masak, I'm fine if it's cooked.  Preferably someplace with beer though.

[07:41] <masak> so far, we haven't had any spectacular failures re food.

[07:41] <masak> there are lots of eateries here in Old Town.

[07:42] <cotto> that's promising.  Should I just go outside, spin around and pick whichever place I end up pointing at?

[07:42] <jnthn> Yes, provided it's not McDonalds ;)

[07:42] <tadzik> does anyone have a machine with, like, enourmous amount of ram? I'd like to try parsing S26 with GC turned off, and my 2 GBs fill up in like a few seconds...

[07:43] <tadzik> oh, I can still try ms2

[07:43] <cotto> tadzik, I have a bunch though some of it's known-bad.

[07:43] <cotto> not a lot, but it doesn't take a lot

[07:44] <tadzik> cotto: what do you mean by known-bad?

[07:44] *** jaldhar left
[07:44] <cotto> tadzik, produces errors in memtest86

[07:45] <tadzik> oh, ok

[07:45] <pmichaud> "Bad Memory!  No refresh for you!"

[07:45] <tadzik> ok, it still fails on ms2

[07:45] <tadzik> so it's probably not write bareers

[07:45] <jnthn> tadzik: OK, that means it's not a missing wb and thus is likely a missing mark.

[07:46] <tadzik> oh, so still bad?

[07:46] <tadzik> crap

[07:46] <jnthn> yeah

[07:46] <tadzik> I'd like to make sure, I don't want to declare it a blocker until I'm sure it is

[07:48] * moritz also gets the "Method 'push' not found for invocant of class 'Undef'", this time while compiling t/spec/S05-capture/caps.t

[07:48] <tadzik> but it segfaults on bare perl6.pbc too, so that's, ehm, ok

[07:49] <pmichaud> wtf?  I just got the error when trying to build rakudo.

[08:05] <masak> I think that's enough C programming for a while.

[08:06] <pmichaud> must be that some blocks don't have a .[1] entry yet.

[08:08] <pmichaud> I suppose I could put the decls into .[0]

[08:08] *** drbean left
[08:08] * pmichaud tries that

[08:10] <pmichaud> I still wish I knew what is causing nom to compile so much slower than master

[08:10] <tadzik> we have memory issues too, don't we?

[08:11] <tadzik> I mean, master didn't need 1.5 Gbs

[08:11] <tadzik> * GBs

[08:11] <moritz> I wonder if it's because we do more things in the setting

[08:11] <pmichaud> actually, nom's setting is smaller (loc) than masters

[08:11] <pmichaud> so I suspect that isn't it.

[08:12] <pmichaud> pmichaud@kiwi:~/nom$ wc src/gen/CORE.setting 6984  23853 210955 src/gen/CORE.setting

[08:12] <pmichaud> 7910 src/gen/core.pm

[08:13] <moritz> I wonder if we could compile each statementlist as soon as it's parsed, and then discard the PAST tree

[08:13] <moritz> or something like that

[08:15] <pmichaud> changing .[1] to .[0] seems to have fixed the problem.. spectesting

[12:13] <tadzik> so a subroutine takes an array, shifts an element, then does something recursively on the rest of the elements

[12:14] <tadzik> so the recursive call shifts the element to, so when you're back to the outer one, the thing you worked on is shifted

[12:23] <masak> pmichaud, tadzik: the p5 moose pentominoes solver takes 90 minutes on my laptop. any guess as to how long the C solver takes with the same problem?

[12:24] <JimmyZ> aloha: nom?

[12:25] <tadzik> masak: I know almost nothing about the complexity of the algorithm you're using

[12:26] <masak> tadzik: the exact cover problem is NP-complete.

[12:27] <tadzik> o-ho

[12:27] <masak> tadzik: the DLX algorithm does recursion to the level of rows participating in the solution, and is set apart from other algorithms by not cloning any data structures.

[12:27] <masak> it's just links being re-pointed back and forth. hence the name.

[12:28] <masak> anyway, I figgere there could be some overhead from the Perl 5 runloop and stuff, but probably no more than 70%-80%.

[12:28] <masak> I... was wrong :D

[12:28] <JimmyZ> nom: say [].[0..10]

[15:04] <masak> unless it's &perms, that is :P

[19:45] <pmichaud> I'd like to get the nom release out sometime late Tuesday or early Wednesday... but since Europe is several hours advanced from US EST that means an earlier Parrot release is helpful if that can be done.

[20:46] <pmichaud> I'm sure many of us would enjoy an encore presentation, yes.  :-P

[20:46] <TimToady> easier, but more boring, since you'll already know all the jokes

[20:46] <pmichaud> is this talk separate from SOTO?  If so, you could re-give SOTO on Tuesday :-) :-)

[20:46] * pmichaud missed OSCON + SOTO this year :(

[21:26] <jnthn> I did a C level profile too

[21:26] <pmichaud> looks like we're losing a bunch of time in post and pir stages

[21:27] <jnthn> hm

[21:27] <jnthn> The profile at C level showed what seemed to be elevated levels of GC activity

[21:27] <pmichaud> elapsed time is 74s (2011.07) vs 155s (nom)

[21:27] <pmichaud> increases are in parse +24s, post +40s, and pir +14s

[21:28] <jnthn> parse really means parse + past, of course.

[21:28] <pmichaud> correct

[21:28] <jnthn> Well, that's not really true...

[21:28] <pmichaud> but the bulk of the increase (54s out of 81s) isn't in the parsing or in the past

[21:28] <jnthn> We're also building a much more detailed model.

[21:29] <jnthn> But yeah, the losses in later stages are high.

[21:29] <jnthn> Especially past to post.

[21:30] <pmichaud> I don't quite understand why that's 3x longer, tbh.

[21:30] <jnthn> I can believe we're building more PAST nodes.

[21:30] <jnthn> I find it much harder to believe we'd be building 3 times as many though.

[21:31] <jnthn> Is the master profile also using the new register alloc stuff that went into PAST?

[21:31] <pmichaud> yes.

[21:31] <jnthn> OK, good. So we needn't consider that.

[21:32] <pmichaud> the pir we generate is a fair bit bigger

[21:32] <pmichaud> pmichaud@kiwi:~/rakudo$ wc src/gen/core.pir 193150  572697 5738277 src/gen/core.pir

[21:32] <pmichaud> pmichaud@kiwi:~/nom$ wc src/gen/CORE.setting.pir  248375   868844 10555580 src/gen/CORE.setting.pir

[21:33] <masak> lue: 'use' is a parse-time operation. if you only know the name at run time, by definition you can't do 'use' on it.

[21:33] <pmichaud> jnthn: I'm not quite sure why that would be the case.

[21:34] <pmichaud> (it's not wrong for that to be the case.. I'm just not certain of the reasons why)

[21:34] <lue> oh, ok. (Using custom output modules for Pod6 will be... interesting, then)

[21:34] *** dorlamm joined
[21:34] <pmichaud> importing at runtime is done with 'require'

[21:35] <pmichaud> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S11.html#Runtime_Importation

[21:35] <jnthn> I guess it's hard to do, but my suspicion is that if we removed the stuff that built classes in the loadinits in master, and removed the deserialization sub in nom, we'd be looking at more level numbers.

[21:36] <pmichaud> well, the real question is "how do we improve this?"   making the parser faster won't help so much

[21:36] <masak> hm. if importation is now to lexpads, and 'require' is done at runtime, doesn't that mean we actually change the lexpad at runtime? isn't that impossible?

[21:36] <pmichaud> masak: require declares lexicals

[21:36] <pmichaud> (I think.)

[21:37] <pmichaud> yes, that's what the "means something like" section says.

[21:38] <masak> ok.

[21:39] <pmichaud> jnthn: even assuming that the regex engine became 2x as fast as master, overall compilation will still be longer than master

[21:39] <jnthn> pmichaud: The :load :init sub is the obvius lace for improvements.

[21:39] <jnthn> *place

[21:39] <jnthn> In the setting it's 160,000 lines long.

[21:39] <pmichaud> yes, I noticed that

[21:39] <pmichaud> oh

[21:39] <pmichaud> I bet we go quadratic on generating the pir for that sub, for one.

[21:40] <pmichaud> since it's a bunch of concatenations

[21:40] <jnthn> ouch.

[21:40] <jnthn> I can look at splitting it up

[21:41] <jnthn> Thing is that it's really meant to "go away" in favor of serialization.

[21:41] <jnthn> But that's a medium-term solution and we could kinda use something sooner I guess.

[21:42] <pmichaud> well, I'm fine with saying that it's something we'll solve in the medium term, as long as we know why it exists and how we'll fix it

[21:42] <jnthn> Looking through the generated code, I suspect various other improvements are possible too.

[21:42] <jnthn> as in, short-term ones

[21:43] <jnthn> Yeah, that :load :init is the thing that's tiding us over until we do the full serialization. 

[21:43] *** buubot_backup joined
[21:45] <jnthn> OK, tomorrow I can spend a couple of hours trying to reduce that somewhat.

[21:45] <pmichaud> that's fine, either way.  I just wanted to get a preliminary look at where the slowdown seems to be occuring, so that we can start thinking about it.

[21:46] <pmichaud> and I'm a bit glad to know that it's not all in parse+past

[21:46] <pmichaud> because I think we have more options there for improvement

[21:46] <jnthn> Oh, for sure we do.

[21:47] <jnthn> How do I run the stage timings, btw?

[21:47] <pmichaud> just a sec, let me make a couple of commits

[21:47] <pmichaud> I had to patch things in nqp and nom to get them

[21:57] <lue> blog post!    https://rdstar.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/thoughts-on-module-distribution-in-p6/

[21:59] <masak> lue: "The split between Perl 5 and Perl 6 is well known."?

[22:00] <lue> Shoot, I knew I forgot to do something to that post. [Editing...]

[22:00] <masak> I wouldn't rule out Perl 6 module on CPAN that fast if I were you.

[22:01] <masak> s/module/modules/

[22:02] <masak> lue: also, the problem isn't that there isn't a discussion about this. the problem is that there isn't anything better/more concrete than modules.perl6.org so far.

[22:03] <masak> sure, that needs discussion, but what it needs most is someone who (like you) decides to do something.

[22:03] *** pernatiy left
[22:03] <masak> personally, I believe a modules archiving solution will be mostly pain-driven, and I don't believe modules.perl6.org hurts enough yet.

[22:05] <felher> lue++ . Just two things: first "er, object inhertance chain?" -- missing an 'i' here? || second: "when I get started one explaining the module system" -- do you mean 'on' instead of 'one'?

[22:06] <lue> felher: thanks for spotting the typos. Fixing those as well.

[22:07] <felher> lue: you're welcome :)

[22:08] <lue> post updated, hopefully that first item is clearer now.

[22:08] *** bs338 left
[22:09] <lue> masak: if the problem isn't lack of discussion then I must be missing them :)

[22:10] <masak> lue: yes.

[22:10] * lue notes to himself considering a more european sleep/awake cycle, except for that lousy "school" business

[22:11] <masak> the discussions about something CPAN-like seem to ebb and flow a bit.

[22:11] <masak> it's been a while since we had one on a bigger-ish scale.

[22:12] <masak> lue: but rest assured that the topic does come up. jnthn, pmichaud and I last discussed it in a cafe here in Riga yesterday.

[22:17] <lue> I would agree that development on the module archiving front would be pain driven (the only alternative is I'm-going-to-fix-it-and-you-can't-stop-me driven, which I haven't the webspace to do)

[22:18] <masak> we have the latter variety too.

[22:18] <masak> here's what wouldn't be useful: someone coming along and saying "hey, I wrote these PDFs about the design about a CPAN system for Perl 6. they're about 120 pages of text. I will now go and implement it. see you in X years."

[22:18] <lue> As long as simple things, like splitting the list of modules into multiple pages and categorization (click here for all Acme:: modules), are easy to implement when need, there won't be any groundbreaking changes to the system.

[22:19] <masak> here's what *would* be useful: someone coming along saying "look. I built this. it works better than modules.perl6.org and Panda together. [here's why.] also, it conforms better to what Perl 6 needs. [here's why.]"

[22:19] *** [Coke] left
[22:20] <lue> I've always been a bit frustrated with the module system, and I just know I'll be less frustrated when I annotate and summarize the revelant parts of the spec. That'll be the first step.

[22:22] *** [Coke] joined
[22:24] <masak> fair enough.

[22:31] <flussence> I like the idea of decentralised packages - the top level is just a set of metadata describing known module repositories. It works pretty well for gentoo/things based on it.

[22:35] *** [Coke] joined
[22:36] <lue> I was thinking more of a mix. Packages can be stored on the system, however it also has the ability to use off-site things. Not sure how good that would work out though.

[22:39] <felher> Is there a good way to export some data-structure ( some nested hashes and arrays with just strings and numbers in them) to a file at runtime and load it later on?

[22:39] <flussence> sounds like a good fit for json...

[22:40] <ruz> felher: https://github.com/moritz/json/

[22:42] <felher> flussence: Hm, yeah, i think i didn't specify my problem clear enough. The problem is that i have some text-file i want to parse. But parsing takes like two hours. I would like to parse only once, store the parsed data in some format one can import really fast (instead of reparsing it - what json would do), and load it later on instaed of reparsing the text-file.

[22:43] <felher> how fast ist .perl it once and then eval the output later on?

[22:43] *** [Coke] left
[22:44] <flussence> well, building rakudo has to compile a few thousand lines of perl6 and that takes about 10 minutes on a fast machine...

[22:45] <felher> flussence: hm, agreed. :)

[22:45] *** [Coke] joined
[22:45] <felher> i give .perl and eval a try.

[22:50] <masak> felher: way back then, we used .perl and &eval for storing things to file in November the wiki engine.

[22:51] <masak> felher: of course, we were aware already at the time that it was a security hazard and the wrong tool for the job.

[22:51] <masak> but it worked, and we were building everything from stop-gap measures anyway.
