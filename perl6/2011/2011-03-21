[21:26] <masak> I don't know if I've told y'all, but I'm doing a Perl 6 kata in public tomorrow.

[21:26] <masak> not at GoOpen per se, but at a meetup later in the evening.

[21:28] <tadzik> Perl 6 kata?

[21:29] *** stkowski left
[21:29] *** Bucciarati left
[21:30] *** stkowski joined
[21:31] <masak> right. there's four of us, each doing the same kata in some language.

[21:31] <masak> the other three are doing it in Ruby, Java, and JavaScript.

[21:32] <masak> this is all thanks to sjn++, who got me over to GoOpen and put me in the kata session.

[21:32] <tadzik> so a set of educational exercises?

[21:32] <masak> the concept 'kata' is from martial arts, IIUC.

[21:32] <masak> it's a set of simple movements that you do over and over again.

[21:33] <masak> their purpose is not to push the limits so much as to practice the basics.

[21:34] <masak> here's the kata we're going to do: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataMinesweeper

[21:34] <masak> the time limit is 15-20 minutes.

[21:35] <masak> (per person; we're going one after the other)

[21:39] *** ab5tract joined
[21:39] <masak> moritz_++ # Yes We Cannot

[21:41] <moritz_> even yapsi cannot

[21:41] <masak> it can't "can't"

[21:44] <masak> so, anyway. I ran through the kata for the first time on the plane here. at minute 29 I got to the nice refactorings. :)

[21:44] <masak> more speed. I need it.

[21:45] <masak> I think I might have wasted some speed in the first run thinking about data structures.
