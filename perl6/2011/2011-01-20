[10:57] <jnthn> D'oh.

[10:57] <jnthn> The temperature has decidedly dropped overnight too.

[11:01] <arnsholt_> Ah, the joys of Scandinavian living =)

[11:01] *** arnsholt_ is now known as arnsholt

[11:02] <arnsholt> (I have the same problem, incidentally)

[11:02] <arnsholt> Especially since I live in an old building and my room has single glazed windows

[11:02] <masak> having tried settings 5 (too warm) and 0 (goosebumps), I'm now exploring 3.

[11:03] <masak> arnsholt: I think people here in Sweden are silently proud of almost everything being triple-glassed.

[11:03] * masak czechs how many layers his apartment has

[11:05] *** f00li5h joined
[11:06] *** tzhs joined
[11:06] <mathw> I was impressed when I was in Sweden with the glazing and insulation

[11:06] <mathw> I was there in a very hot summer, and the buildings somehow managed to stay bearable

[11:07] <mathw> while still being obviously constructed to handle a horribly cold winter

[11:07] <mathw> in the UK, we build buildings which are suitable for neither winter nor summer

[11:07] <huf> insulation is insulation, goes either way

[11:07] <mathw> the only thing they are good at is keeping the rain outside

[11:07] <mathw> and some of them struggle with that

[11:08] <mathw> it really is quite shameful

[11:08] <huf> you dont get extreme summers/winters though?

[11:08] <mathw> they do happen

[11:08] <mathw> but they're not predictable

[11:09] <mathw> but if you build here to, say, Swedish norms, you can heat the place by lighting a single candle (almost)

[11:09] <huf> :)

[11:09] <mathw> so shouldn't we be doing that

[11:09] *** mce_ro joined
[11:09] <masak> yes, you should.

[11:09] <mathw> modern houses are better insulated, there are rules

[11:09] <mathw> but they're still not as good

[11:09] <masak> I say this having stayed in some UK buildings.

[11:10] <flussence> my house is so waterproof that I just wrote "hose" and didn't notice until I was trying to think of a suitable analogy.

[11:10] <huf> i still prefer the older houses, although upgrading the windows is a must

[11:10] <mathw> I'm trying to persuade my landlord to upgrade the windows

[11:10] <mathw> but this seems unlikely to happen

[11:10] <mathw> since it's kind of expensive

[11:11] <huf> they built proper walls back in the 1910-1930 timespan

[11:11] <arnsholt> masak: So are most Norwegians. Unfortunately I don't think my building has seen much renovation the last three or four decades :/

[11:11] <huf> (at least here)

[11:11] <arnsholt> But at least the rent is cheap =)

[11:12] <masak> as far as I can see, my windows are double-glassed.

[11:13] <huf> yes, but are the two layers stuck together or each in their separate frame?

[11:13] <mathw> mine are double-glazed... with about a 4mm gap between the panes

[11:14] <mathw> my parents have rather more modern windows, with a 20mm gap - and perhaps more importantly, frames that don't admit draughts

[11:15] <huf> i used to have the old-style wooden frame, double window thing. that was horrible

[11:15] <huf> now it's nice plastic frame, thermo glass

[11:15] <flussence> I have one of those :(

[11:15] <flussence> the rope's broken on it.

[11:15] <huf> now the only place my room vents is above the windows, through the casing of the blinds

[11:16] <huf> rope? on a window? how?

[11:17] <mathw> sash window? ow

[11:17] <mathw> those are expensive to get fixed

[11:17] <huf> the kind that dont open but slide up? ow

[11:17] <huf> i hated those when we had them (in the us)

[11:19] <flussence> yeah, my house is pretty terrible for insulation. The wooden frame on our back door is rotting away too, but it's a nonstandard size so it's impossible to get fixed.

[11:19] <flussence> (and I keep banging my head on the top of it.)

[11:20] <mathw> doh

[14:25] <PerlJam> BristolBath is the name that gets used when no one can think of a better name?  :)

[14:25] <masak> it's currently the only suggestion in the list of suggestions in the release guide.

[14:25] <masak> so, in a sense, yes.

[14:26] <tadzik> it'd be nice to have some nice words about it

[14:40] <tadzik> PerlJam: it came from "quihw++" in moritz's commit

[14:40] * masak was thinking the same thing

[14:41] <masak> should be qiuhw++, then.

[14:41] <masak> but could be a typo.

[14:41] <PerlJam> According to google, that commit is the only place that nick appears in the #perl6 logs

[14:41] <tadzik> fixed

[14:42] * masak is surprised that he hasn't contributed this month

[14:42] <masak> oh well, something to do better till next release :)

[14:42] <tadzik> oh

[14:43] <PerlJam> I wonder if we should include commit stats (and authors) for roast in this announcement too

[14:44] <PerlJam> Those are indirect contributions to Rakudo, but maybe more appropriate for R*

[14:44] <masak> they are indirect contributions to all implementations...

[14:45] <PerlJam> indeed.

[14:45] <dalek> rakudo: Small fix in release announcement

[14:45] <dalek> rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0289d97f49

[14:45] <PerlJam> I'd rather every implementation mention them than none mention them because they aren't implementation specific.

[14:49] <JimmyZ> So release roast?

[14:49] <masak> interesting notion.

[14:50] <masak> question is how to motivate the extra work/administration that entails.

[14:52] <JimmyZ> I think no implementations pass all roast

[14:52] <masak> correct. that'd be the day.

[14:53] <JimmyZ> most whenever

[14:53] <masak> going with the strict interpretation of "pass[ing] all of roast", I would guess that no implementation ever will.

[14:54] <masak> if there ever is one, so much the better.

[14:54] <masak> but usually there are a couple of TODOs or SKIPs in every project, even very complete ones.

[14:54] <JimmyZ> yes

[14:55] <tadzik> release done!

[14:55] <flussence> postincrement!

[14:55] <PerlJam> If an implementation passes all of roast, I think that's a good indication that roast needs more tests :)

[14:56] <JimmyZ> I'd like define roast version, So implemetation can say 'we pass roast 1.1', or 'we pass roast 1.5', something like C89 and C99 

[14:58] <JimmyZ> or like java?

[14:58] <PerlJam> masak: sounds like JimmyZ has the requisite motivation already ;)

[14:58] <masak> :)

[14:58] <masak> tadzik++

[15:00] <JimmyZ> PerlJam: just got inspiration from you :)

[15:00] <tadzik> (check if it runs)

[15:01] <PerlJam> JimmyZ: good deal!  I'm like that sometimes.   I make sparks here and there and sometimes they create fire  :)

[15:01] <JimmyZ> PerlJam: hehe 

[15:02] <JimmyZ> something like "火上浇油'

[15:03] <masak> fuel?

[15:03] <JimmyZ> yep

[15:03] <masak> "pouring oil on fire" :P

[15:04] <JimmyZ> most means "you're unhappy and I make you more unhappy", it's not good words in china

[15:12] <masak> today's mini-challenge: write a multi join that special-cases the separator between the last two elements (if any): "A, B, C, D, E, and F" (the separator being ', and' between E and F.

[15:12] <masak> this was brought up during Advent 2009, but I think that nicer solutions can be wrought than the one I did then.

[15:18] <pmichaud> good morning #perl6

[15:18] <jnthn> multi method join(*@ [$cur, *@rest]) { self[0..*-2].join(|@rest) ~ $cur ~ self[*-1] }

[15:18] <masak> pmichaud! \o/

[15:18] <jnthn> o/ pmichaud 

[15:20] <masak> jnthn: yes, that was what I had in mind. nice with the use of a nested signature. wouldn't that one collide with the regular &join, though?

[15:21] <jnthn> Why?

[15:21] <jnthn> Oh, if it gets exported...

[15:21] *** felliott joined
[15:21] <masak> because it also has that signature.

[15:21] <masak> I think the special last separator needs to be a required named parameter.

[15:21] <jnthn> Well, I had it that way so you could have as many separators as you want :)

[15:21] <masak> ooh :)

[15:22] <masak> that's over-solving the problem, though :)

[15:22] <jnthn> A, B, C, D or E or even F

[15:22] <jnthn> :P

[15:22] <jnthn> I know but I wanted to show off my 1337 sig skillz, you see. :)

[15:22] <jnthn> But yes, it is overkill perhaps. :)

[15:23] <masak> jnthn: you have 1337 sig skillz. now try to solve the problem so that your new &join multi can co-exist with the regular one. that's part of the problem. :)

[15:24] <jnthn> I'll think about it on the way to systemet. :)

[16:45] <pmurias> sorear: hi

[16:47] *** kensanata left
[16:47] *** orafu joined
[16:50] <masak> hm. consider a code analysis tool. it sees a call to a multi method. it wants to try to figure out *which* multi will bind, if any.

[16:50] <masak> ...there's probably a Halting Problem involved, since types are involved...

[16:51] <masak> ...but it's essentially the same as the runtime will have to do, except with possibly slightly less information available.

[16:51] <pmurias> the runtime has more information available

[16:51] <pmurias> much more

[16:51] <masak> that's what I said.

[16:51] <masak> minus the "much" :)

[16:52] <masak> the multi call could be late-bound by intent.

[16:52] <pmurias> but we have to do that to get even vaguely resonable performance on numerics

[16:52] <masak> in that case, we won't ever get *one* candidate to fall out of the analysis. but it's not necessarily a conflict.

[16:53] <masak> it's more of a case-by-case analysis.

[16:53] <pmurias> you have to do type inference

[16:53] <pmurias> but of a different kind that you do during typechecking

[16:53] *** slavik1 left
[16:54] *** slavik1 joined
[16:54] <masak> aye.

[16:54] <sorear> yesterday's changes were a substantial improvement, but not quite substantial enough

[16:54] <pmurias> it should be possible to do that vi 

[16:54] <pmurias> sorry

[16:54] <pmurias> sorear: what changes?

[16:54] <masak> I'm thinking in the context of code path analysis.

[16:55] <pmurias> dataflow analysis should do that

[16:55] <sorear> pmurias: primitive @(), [], mostly-eager grep and map

[16:55] <pmurias> sorear: i thought you were refering to infering multis

[16:56] <pmurias> masak: with a framework like hoopl it should be even possible to combine them together

[16:56] <pmurias> so that my $foo = 123; if 0 {$foo = "hi"}; say $foo + 12 # the correct multi for addition is determined at compile time

[16:57] <masak> cool.

[16:57] <masak> slightly useless example, but I get it.

[16:58] <masak> 'if some-real-condition() {$foo = "hi"}' is probably vastly more common.

[16:59] *** envi left
[16:59] <masak> hm, if the correct multi for addition is determined at compile time, the addition could be *made* (and persisted) at compile-time.

[16:59] <masak> basically, constant folding across statements.

[16:59] <pmurias> yes that would be done

[16:59] <pmurias> too

[17:00] <pmurias> what i meant is that it should be possible to combine type-inference, constant folding and dead branch elimination and other stuff together

[17:01] *** justatheory joined
[17:05] <masak> aye.

[17:05] *** slavik1 left
[17:05] <masak> I can see how that would be useful/awesome.

[17:05] *** slavik1 joined
[17:07] <jnthn> masak: There's a big difference in the amount of analysis we can do in multi subs vs multi methods.

[17:08] <jnthn> masak: With multi subs, in a given lexical scope we know the candidate list statically.

[17:08] <masak> aye.

[17:08] <jnthn> With multi-methods, we don't know the candidate list.

[17:08] *** plobsing joined
[17:08] <pmurias> unless we know the type of the invocant

[17:08] <masak> it strongly parallels the case with only subs and only methods.

[17:08] <masak> pmurias: even then...

[17:08] <pmurias> and the class is closed

[17:08] <jnthn> pmurias: Doesn't help though

[17:09] <masak> right, when the class is closed, it's a different story.

[17:09] <jnthn> pmurias: Right, the closed is needed.

[17:09] <masak> but that's not the default in Perl 6.

[17:09] <jnthn> But you can't close a class individually. So it's left for full program optimization to worry about.

[17:10] <jnthn> Which is tricky because it's then cross-module optimization so you may have to re-compile modules specifially for the way they're used in a given whole program.

[17:10] <masak> if we can somehow rule out that anon subclassing has taken place, we might also be able to do some more analysis.

[17:10] <jnthn> Well, yeah

[17:10] <masak> like, if the object was created in the same scope.

[17:10] <masak> (and nothing suspicious happened since then)

[17:10] <jnthn> Closedness only gives you more room for analysis because it forbids the anonymous subclassing.

[17:11] <jnthn> But what if the program relies on it? Well, then it's a trickier issue. :)

[17:11] <masak> right.

[17:11] <masak> you can't have the dynamism cake and eat it, too.

[17:11] <jnthn> Decidedly not. It causes terrible indigestion if you try.

[17:12] <masak> jnthn, the destroyer of metaphors. :P

[17:12] <masak> jnthn: you could put that on your business card!

[17:12] * PerlJam wonders what's the point of having a cake  but not being able to eat it.

[22:42] <dalek> nqp-rx/nom: The find_method op throws method not found exceptions, and the API is for find_method v-table not to; make the KnowHOW.^find_method play that way.

[22:42] <dalek> nqp-rx/nom: 26ac097 | jonathan++ | src/metamodel/reprs/P6opaque.c:

[22:42] <dalek> nqp-rx/nom: Get P6opaque most of the way to consuming the storage spec provided by a REPR. In theory, this means it can allocate storage for natively typed attributes. In practice, there's no way to test this just yet.

[23:45] <snarkyboojum> I don't have commit access to the rakudo repo, but I'd be happy to do a release if people are looking for future release boffins :)

[23:45] <snarkyboojum> though I suppose commit access is a prerequisite :D

[23:46] <lichtkind_> i think so too :)

[23:47] * [Coke] supposes he should volunteer for another one.

[23:47] <[Coke]> maybe after dayjob stops being nightjob also.

[23:49] * snarkyboojum is between dayjobs atm
