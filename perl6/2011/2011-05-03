[17:05] <colomon> \o

[17:05] <colomon> uvtc: no

[17:06] <uvtc> Is Rakudo written in nqp?

[17:06] <colomon> I believe jnthn++ is hoping to get a little more done before he (or better yet, we) starts migrating Rakudo to it.

[17:06] <masak> uvtc: and C. and PIR. and Perl 6.

[17:06] <jnthn> uvtc: rakudo/nom branch is where that work will be done.

[17:07] <jnthn> I'm REALLY close with the nqp changes now.

[17:07] <jnthn> o/ masak 

[17:07] <masak> \o

[17:08] *** jimmy1980 left
[17:08] <jnthn> uvtc: The Rakudo grammar and actions are currently written in NQP, and some module loading bits are.

[17:08] <jnthn> uvtc: In rakudo/nom, those will stay in NQP. Also the main compiler object will be in NQP, the meta-objects will be in NQP also.

[17:09] <jnthn> The current set of PIR built-ins will largely go away. Any PIR that stays will get wrapped in a Perl 6 body. There won't be any pure PIR files that we compile in Rakudo. It'll be just NQP, Perl 6 (in the setting), C (dynops, dynpmcs) and the odd bit of PIR in method bodies.

[17:10] <masak> wut? http://www.perldonate.com/

[17:10] <masak> "The fact of the matter is you have to be a really good programmer in Perl and C, and have knowledge of the way many other languages work, to be able to make a useful contribution to Perl development." -- emphatically not.

[17:10] <Moukeddar> masak, that www.infow.com is a BOMB

[17:10] <Moukeddar> thanks

[17:10] <Moukeddar> any similar?

[17:11] <uvtc> Could someone be so kind as to point me to "rakudo/nom"? I only see at github rakudo/rakudo and rakudo/star.

[17:11] <masak> Moukeddar: yes, but not right now. just hand around here ;)

[17:11] <Moukeddar> infoq.com

[17:11] <jnthn> uvtc: It's a branch in rakudo/rakudo

[17:11] <Moukeddar> masak, no problem

[17:11] <moritz> uvtc: but there's not yet much to be seen

[17:11] <jnthn> uvtc: Nothing to see yet.

[17:11] <jnthn> uvtc: Check back in a week or two. :)

[17:11] <uvtc> jnthn: Doh. Thanks.

[17:11] <masak> re the above quote, the fact of the matter is that the most precious thing people can donate to us, good programmers or not, is their time, interest, and enthusiasm. there are many ways to apply those.

[17:11] <jnthn> uvtc: All the work so far has been in NQP, leading up to this.

[17:12] <uvtc> jnthn: Will definitely check back. :)

[17:12] <jnthn> uvtc: But in reality much of that work directly applies to Rakudo also.

[17:12] <Su-Shee> masak: now that is some nonsense..

[17:12] <colomon> masak: I dunno, a few hundred thousand dollars wouldn't hurt either.  ;)

[17:13] <Su-Shee> masak: I ofcourse meant the matter of fact statement and not yours :)

[17:13] <masak> Su-Shee: I was wondering :P

[17:13] <masak> colomon: sure! no doubt. but our bottleneck isn't really money.

[17:14] <colomon> well, it kind of is, but only in a "huge amounts of money" sense.

[17:15] <colomon> I mean, if there was enough money to hire ten of us to work full time on Rakudo, things would get done more quickly.

[17:15] <masak> yes, but.

[17:15] <masak> look at Star Wars.

[17:15] <colomon> for people with sensible amounts of money, donating time and enthusiasm is probably more useful.

[17:16] <Su-Shee> colomon: if you don't have the money, you'd need attraction to others. 

[17:16] <masak> the good trilogy was made on a limited budget with limited resources. the bad trilogy was made with a ton of money, a huge staff, and all the latest visual effects.

[17:16] <masak> "art from adversity".

[17:17] <masak> I believe that's not just sour grapes talking. I think in some sense, Perl 6 needs to be an underdog project.

[17:18] <uvtc> Does Rakudo rely on STD.pm6 (the "standard Perl 6 grammar") to know what it's parsing?

[17:19] <Su-Shee> well .. people like me would like to see it really be a commonly used language because that's the only way you'd get all tools and libs and modules you really need. 

[17:19] <colomon> uvtc: not yet

[17:19] <moritz> uvtc: it imitates large parts of STD, but it doesn't use it in the form of calling it

[17:19] <colomon> uvtc: Rakudo's grammar is a stripped-down and hacked-up version of STD

[17:19] <PerlJam> uvtc: STD.pm6 is more of a guideline for Rakudo  :)

[17:20] <Su-Shee> colomon: sure it's not hacked down and stripped up? ;)

[17:20] <uvtc> Wow. Interesting. What is the reason for Rakudo not using STD.pm6?

[17:20] <PerlJam> uvtc: STD.pm6 is Too Advanced for one.

[17:20] <colomon> uvtc: STD.pm6 is by far the most complicated thing ever written in Perl 6.  Rakudo is not sophisticated enough to parse it yet.

[17:21] <colomon> ... maybe more process than parse, I suppose.

[17:21] *** am0c joined
[17:21] <uvtc> Hm. I think I'm asking questions, the answers to which I don't yet have the sophistication to understand. :)

[17:21] <PerlJam> uvtc: also, STD.pm6 was/is in flux enough that it would have been a nightmare to keep up with the changes.

[17:22] <colomon> PerlJam++ # very good point

[17:22] <masak> that's better now, though.

[17:22] <moritz> note that niecza uses a far less stripped-down version of STD.pm6

[17:22] <moritz> which is why you get all sorts of fancy error message from it *and* you can run code with it

[17:23] <moritz> niecza: if(3) { say 'oh yes' }

[17:23] <p6eval> niecza v4-76-g7bf5ef9: OUTPUT«Unhandled exception: System.FormatException: Unknown char: A␤  at System.Double.Parse (System.String s, NumberStyles style, IFormatProvider provider) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 ␤  at System.Double.Parse (System.String s, IFormatProvider provider) [0x00000] in

[17:23] <p6eval> ..<filename unkno…

[17:23] <moritz> ouch

[17:23] <moritz> this is not the error message you are looking for

[17:24] <uvtc> Blogging request: Would love to see an introductory article describing how Rakudo, npq, STD.pm6, PCT, etc. all fit (or would fit, or should fit, or soon might fit) together.

[17:25] <moritz> uvtc: like http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/rakudo-overview.html but in updated?

[17:26] <uvtc> moritz: {...reading...}

[17:26] <PerlJam> moritz: updated to include the other implementations too would be very nice.

[17:26] <PerlJam> moritz: and other Rakudo backends 

[17:26] <moritz> PerlJam: I fear I don't know enough about other implementations to do that

[17:27] <PerlJam> well, maybe just niecza.  At least you can ask sorear lots of questions  :)

[17:27] <moritz> and I don't know anything about other rakudo backends, except that they are in planning

[17:31] <moritz> ah, it's even in rakudo

[17:31] <moritz> in doc/architecture.{svg,html}

[17:32] <uvtc> moritz: re. "like {this} but updated?", no, I don't think so. I'm more interested in learning what pieces Rakudo is made of. Evidently, it's mostly made of nqp, but also some C, PIR, and Perl 6. It also makes use of a "grammar"

[17:32] <uvtc> moritz: but I don't really understand what that means in a practical sense.

[17:32] <PerlJam> uvtc: do you know what NQP is ?

[17:32] <uvtc> PerlJam: fwict, it's a subset of Perl 6.

[17:33] <moritz> uvtc: in what practical sense? for modifying it? for compiling it? for runtime speed? feature completeness?

[17:34] <PerlJam> uvtc: aye.  Just enough of a subset to parse the Perl 6 used to create Rakudo (the various modules, grammar and actions).  The bits that NQP can't actually implement natively yet are farmed out to either C or PIR

[17:37] <uvtc> moritz: In a practical sense -- that is, reading the wikipedia page on grammars does not really help me understand what a grammer is and how Rakudo would use it to run Perl 6 code.

[17:38] <uvtc> moritz: Perhaps I skipped too many high school english classes. :)

[17:38] <colomon> Rakudo uses it to parse Perl 6 code.

[17:38] <PerlJam> uvtc: a grammar describes the structure and semantics of a language.

[17:39] *** Moukeddar left
[17:40] <PerlJam> uvtc: so, for example, the rule moritz has been trying to diddle with niecza is "an identifier immediately followed by parens is a function call" i.e. "foo()"  is a function call, but "foo ()" is not

[17:41] <uvtc> PerlJam: Ok, the grammar is what specifies that. Gotcha.

[17:42] <PerlJam> uvtc: in our case, the grammar is written in Perl  6.

[17:43] *** fhelmberger_ left
[17:44] <uvtc> But in what way can Rakudo use STD.pm6 as its parser if it have a parser to parse it. (How much wood would a wood chuck chuck...)

[17:44] <uvtc> s/if it/if it must/

[17:45] <PerlJam> uvtc: through a process called bootstrapping.

[17:46] <PerlJam> uvtc: you build a mini-compiler  that undertands enough of your language that you can then write your language in terms of itself.

[17:46] <moritz> uvtc: nqp can also parse Perl 6 (though not quite as completely as STD.pm6 can)

[17:46] <moritz> it's just like most C compilers today are written in C

[17:46] *** fhelmberger joined
[17:47] *** fhelmberger left
[17:47] <jnthn> uvtc: NQP keeps an "already compiled" version of itself

[17:47] <jnthn> It uses that to compile itself again, so changes can be made

[17:47] *** fhelmberger joined
[17:48] <jnthn> At some points, that "already compiled" base version gets updated.

[17:49] <uvtc> So, at some point in the future, Rakudo's own bootstrapping parser will be able to parse STD.pm6, and then it will be able to handle any Perl 6 you throw at it?

[17:49] <PerlJam> uvtc: maybe

[17:49] <moritz> at least on the syntax level, yes

[17:50] <colomon> that's the ideal goal, for sure.

[17:50] <uvtc> I think I need to sip some herbal tea and ponder the nature of bootstrapping compilers...

[19:14] <arnsholt> Hmm. What's the sensible extension of modulo to the complex domain, I wonder?

[19:15] <masak> arnsholt: might be there ain't one. in which case NaN would be fine.

[19:15] <masak> but it shouldn't cause a stack failure.

[19:15] <arnsholt> Yeah, there's no immediately obvious generalisation that I can see

[19:16] <arnsholt> Yeah, it's definitely a bug. Probably because noone found a sensible generalisation and the fallback is to numify both arguments, or some such at a guess

[19:17] *** birdwindupbird joined
[19:18] <masak> no, I don't see how the idea of a remainder generalizes to the complex plane.

[19:26] <masak> that's the first *use* of Gaussian integers that I've seen. :)

[19:27] <masak> but still, that definition of a complex remainder seems a bit tangled with the iterations of Euclid's algorithm.

[21:45] <jnthn> moritz: Think I've got the rename done.

[21:46] <jnthn> Couple of surprises. ;)

[22:03] <jnthn> oh, it is, just not on push notifications

[22:03] <jnthn> So I have to be patient ;)

[22:03] <tadzik> heuristic branch merge fail?

[22:03] <pmichaud> jnthn: pong

[22:03] <phenny> pmichaud: 01 May 20:44Z <jnthn> tell pmichaud I managed to resolve the prefixes method issue relatively easily in the end. :)

[22:03] <jnthn> Yeah

[22:03] <jnthn> pmichaud: ETOOLATE

[22:03] <pmichaud> +1

[22:03] <pmichaud> I often am.

[22:03] <jnthn> That wasn't what I was going to tell you.

[22:04] <jnthn> Well, ask :)

[22:04] <jnthn> That was old news ;)

[22:04] <pmichaud> so, what's the new news?

[22:04] <jnthn> I had to install e.g. HLL.pbc as NQPHLL.pbc. Just used that prefix for now.

[22:04] <jnthn> Otherwise we scribble over the ones nqp-rx installs

[22:04] <jnthn> Which Parrot relies on

[22:04] <pmichaud> wfm

[22:04] <jnthn> And Rakudo master... :)

[22:04] <jnthn> OK, good. :)

[22:05] <pmichaud> could also be HLL-2 or HLL-nqp or something like that

[22:05] <pmichaud> but any name is fine

[22:05] <jnthn> yeah, I don't feel too strongly.

[22:05] <pmichaud> better might even be nqp/HLL.pbc

[22:05] <jnthn> ooh, yeah

[22:05] <jnthn> It's tied into use statements too... :)

[22:05] <jnthn> Anyway, can always twiddle later with that if we feel like it. It's not too set in stone.

[22:05] <pmichaud> well, then it could go into languages/nqp at some point

[22:06] <pmichaud> since we know we're going to *have* a runtime library, might as well make it a real language :-)

[22:06] <pmichaud> anyway, those are just ideas

[22:06] <jnthn> We already do have .HLL 'nqp'

[22:06] <pmichaud> right

[22:06] <pmichaud> so that tells me perhaps it should be languages/nqp/...whatever

[22:06] <jnthn> The problem is that load_bytecode doesn't (as far as I could tell) look in languages/[hll name]/ at the moment.

[22:06] <pmichaud> (and could potentially be installed that way by Parrot if/when Parrot adopts the new nqp)

[22:07] <pmichaud> not by default, no.  but you can add it to the path, or you can use  load_bytecode 'nqp/hll.pbc'

[22:07] <jnthn> load_language does, mind...

[22:07] <jnthn> True

[22:07] <jnthn> Well, thing is we never write load_bytecode 'HLL.pbc' now. We write use HLL; :)

[22:07] <jnthn> Well, use NQPHLL now...

[22:07] <pmichaud> seems like 'use' could be smarter, then.

[22:07] <pmichaud> i.e., figure out where to look.

[22:07] <jnthn> Yeah, it easily could.

[22:08] <pmichaud> and   use nqp::HLL;  looks nicer still :-)

[22:08] <jnthn> *nod*

[22:08] <pmichaud> anyway, those are ideas -- whatever you decide for now will be just fine

[22:08] <pmichaud> we can always clean it up a bit later

[22:08] <jnthn> Sure, I mostly just wanted to unblock working on rakudo/nom. :)

[22:09] <jnthn> And not being able to install it was my last blocker. :)

[22:09] <pmichaud> I still feel pretty uneasy about the way we generate constants in rakudo; part of me was thinking we might want to fix that first before the branch

[22:09] <pmichaud> but if you're ready for the branch already; any sequence is fine with me

[22:09] <jnthn> Generate constants?

[22:09] * masak .oO( constant unease )

[22:09] <pmichaud> for example,   1.45  currently ends up in being several runtime calls to generate a Rat

[22:09] <jnthn> Eww.

[22:09] <pmichaud> *including* runtime calls to generate a constant 145 and 100 from strings

[22:10] <jnthn> Worse is that 42 gets re-built everytime.

[22:10] <jnthn> Well, also bad

[22:10] <pmichaud> right

[22:10] <jnthn> :)

[22:10] <jnthn> Well, we can fix that

[22:10] <jnthn> Just shove it into the SC.

[22:10] *** araujo left
[22:10] <pmichaud> anyway, it shouldn't be a blocker

[22:10] <pmichaud> again, either way is fine

[22:10] <pmichaud> ....and I'm being called to the other room, so I'll bbl (or maybe tomorrow)

[22:10] <jnthn> It's a trivial fix with the new stuff I've built.

[22:10] <jnthn> So I'll probably take it on during nom. :)

[22:11] <pmichaud> wfm

[22:11] *** Helios left
[22:11] <jnthn> Catch you later/tomorrow

[22:11] <pmichaud> I'm going to continue fleshing out a benchmark suite of sorts

[22:11] <jnthn> OK, excellent

[22:11] <tadzik> . o O ( CATCH { you.later } )

[22:11] <pmichaud> then I'll turn to nqp/raknom

[22:11] <pmichaud> afk

[22:14] <tadzik> jnthn: mind me fixing those perl6multisub.c:955:55: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement ?

[22:14] <jnthn> Which compiler is the style cop?

[22:14] <jnthn> :P

[22:15] <tadzik> gcc of course :)

[22:15] <jnthn> meh

[22:15] <jnthn> Feel free if it makes things quieter. :)

[22:15] <tadzik> I'm on 4.5.2

[22:15] <jnthn> perl6multisub.pmc's life is somewhat endangered.

[22:15] <jnthn> But the code in it will for the most part stay, just elsewhere. :)

[22:16] <masak> why does gcc call it an "empty body"? that's a silly name for dangling syntax.

[22:16] <tadzik> now that I look at it I'm not sure I know what gcc actually means

[22:19] <tadzik> if (foo); bar; is where it should produce such a warning

[22:19] <masak> right.

[22:20] <tadzik> *shrug*

[22:20] <tadzik> I'll pass

[22:21] *** araujo joined
[22:21] <tadzik> well, gcc shuts up when you use { } around the if'ed statement. Stupid

[22:21] <jnthn> gcc--

[22:22] <jnthn> msvc++ 

[22:22] <jnthn> ;)

[22:22] <masak> gccbug!

[22:24] <tadzik> for some reason panda can no longer build with make -j2

[22:24] <tadzik> but it passes all tests on rakudo/nom :)

[22:42] <dr_df0> hello all

[22:48] <dr_df0> jnthn: i'll look for it

[22:48] <jnthn> dr_df0: Perl 6 is language, so it's a meaningless question as you asked it. :) If you really meant, "is Rakudo moving away from Parrot vm", then no, but it is looking to support *additional* backends.

[22:49] <dr_df0> jnthn: right, I meant Rakudo ... after all specs reading such a mistake ... sorry :)

[22:49] <jnthn> No worries :)
