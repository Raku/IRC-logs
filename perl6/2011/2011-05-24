[00:13] <frooh> hey guys, I was hoping to use the build tools from https://github.com/perl6/book to create a commercial work; does anyone know if I can *use* the build tools for theat, given that they themselves won't be distributed or sold?

[00:14] <sorear> frooh: where do you live?

[00:14] <frooh> US

[00:14] <frooh> (TX, to be specific)

[00:15] <sorear> AFAIK, unless you clicked "I agree" at some point, there are no rules on usage

[00:17] <TimToady> well, it my fall under implicit copyright under the Berne Convention, which does potentially have some restrictions

[00:17] <PerlJam> frooh: ask chromatic if you can use the tools he used for his book.

[00:17] <frooh> PerlJam: yeah, that's really what I should do

[00:18] <frooh> anyone know the best way to get in touch with him?

[00:19] <TimToady> say something stupid on reddit?

[00:19] <frooh> me?

[00:19] <frooh> ohhh

[00:19] <frooh> I get it

[02:27] <jdhore1> oh, I didn't read that correctly

[02:27] <jdhore1> Well the thing is, I don't have any Windows boxes and i'm rather glad I don't have Mono (or Java, for that matter) on my system.

[02:29] <sorear> did you use Java before it was associated with Oracle and Larry Ellison?

[02:29] <jdhore1> not really

[02:30] <jdhore1> but between when they open-sourced it and the Oracle transition was complete, I thought Java was DECENT.

[20:24] <cognominal_> jthn  I don't want to be pushy but if you still want to come, we are longing to see your talks proposals in fpw 2011 site. Too bad you can't drag them from an ACT site to another :)

[20:26] <jnthn> cognominal_: I'm not entirely sure I can...it's a week after Nordic Perl Workshop and a week before the BJPW.

[20:27] <cognominal_> thx, I just to konw the odds.

[20:27] <jnthn> cognominal_: Will try and decide for sure soon.

[20:27] <jnthn> Like, next couple of days.

[20:27] <phenny> pmichaud: 23 May 23:48Z <sorear> tell pmichaud How hard do you intend to fight 1 => $foo ?  I'd rather not be implementing it if it will go away soon.

[20:27] <cognominal_> jnthn: ok, thx

[20:27] <pmichaud> sorear: I don't intend to fight hard.

[20:28] <pmichaud> I disagree with it, even strongly, and will support others who oppose it, but I don't plan to lead the fight.  :)

[20:28] <pmichaud> I'm also open-minded enough to accept that perhaps it's useful and just haven't seen the example yet.

[21:41] <colomon> was the stack trace of any use to you?  is there something else I can do to help along that front?

[21:42] <jnthn> colomon: It was useful of you to provide it. Sadly, it doesn't immediately pinpoint where the problem lies - it's more action-at-a-distance-y. :(

[21:42] <sorear> I plan to do nothing wrt. positionals and names until the spec is next changed

[21:43] <sorear> the change I am hoping for is 1. revert last change 2. make named-positional conversion "opt in" (syntax TBD)

[21:43] <sorear> but any solution that pmichaud is happy with, I'd also be fine with

[21:44] <moritz> fwiw rakudo/nom also fails to build for me

[21:44] <moritz> "Method 'compose' not found for invocant of class 'SixModelObject'"

[21:44] <moritz> while compiling the setting

[21:44] <sorear> how much memory does rakudo take to build these days?

[21:45] <jnthn> moritz: Ouch. 

[21:45] <sorear> if it's back under 80 Mwords or so, I'd like to get an up to date rakudo installed

[21:45] <moritz> I think the aggressiveness of the GC depends on available memory these days

[21:45] <jnthn> moritz: Can I have full output?

[21:45] <moritz> jnthn: forthcoming...

[21:48] <sorear> perl6/std:CORE.setting is pretty much at the bottom of the spec hierarchy

[21:52] <jnthn> moritz: oddness.

[21:54] <moritz> fwiw nom never built for me

[21:54] <jnthn> It only started building for me yesterday :)

[21:55] <moritz> I know :-)

[21:57] <moritz> jnthn: sooner or later you need to produce better error messages than Method <methodname> not found for invocant of class 'SixModelObject' -- maybe "sooner" helps debugging

[21:57] <colomon> jnthn: oh, hey, I'm back to the OS X bug, I think!

[21:57] <colomon> > ld: can't open output file for writing: perl6, errno=21

[21:58] <sorear> colomon: perl -E '$! = 21; say $!'

[21:58] <moritz> "is a directory"

[21:58] <moritz> we've had that before

[21:58] <colomon> moritz: yes, thus "I'm back to".

[21:58] <moritz> stupid case insensitivity

[21:58] <sorear> ...do you have a directory with the same name as the file?

[21:58] <colomon> yesterday I couldn't even get that far.  :)

[21:58] <jnthn> moritz: Yeah, I knows. :)

[21:58] <colomon> sorear: yes

[21:58] <sorear> right, makes total sense.

[21:59] <sorear> shouldn't it be src/Perl6/... ?

[21:59] <jnthn> sorear: That's the uncompiled source.

[21:59] <sorear> does nom do away with src?

[21:59] <jnthn> sorear: the Perl6 directory holds the compiled output.

[21:59] <jnthn> sorear: Maybe should be lib :)

[22:00] <jnthn> or blib

[22:00] <jnthn> :)

[22:00] <moritz> or src/gen/

[22:00] * jnthn has no idea :)

[22:00] <jnthn> moritz: Well, not really (more)

[22:00] <jnthn> These are actual PBCs that we will want to install

[22:00] <benabik> HFS is case insensitive.  On most OS X machines, "Perl6" and "perl6" are the same file.

[22:01] <jnthn> benabik: Yeah, I was OS X ignorant. :)

[22:01] * moritz thinks that "gen" stands generally for generated files, indepently of whether they should be installed or not

[22:01] <benabik> Oh, I think someone mentioned it already.  Timer went off in kitchen and delayed advice.  :-/

[22:01] <moritz> oh, bold fail :-)

[22:02] <jnthn> moritz: Well, it's more about where a "use" statement will look.

[22:03] <benabik> jnthn: I've spent the last few years making fixes in git's source where someone didn't think about it, so I'm far more used to it than anyone should.

[22:21] <pmichaud> yes, the gen/ directory is meant to be for files that are generated files.

[22:21] <pmichaud> It's unrelated to install.

[22:21] <pmichaud> it's okay if gen/ gets subdirectories

[22:22] <jnthn> pmichaud: How do you propose use knows to look in gen pre-install and not post-install?

[22:22] <pmichaud> jnthn: PERL6LIB?

[22:22] <jnthn> pmichaud: That'd probably work.

[22:22] <pmichaud> seems like the most obvious answer

[22:23] <jnthn> If we make NQP pay attention to it as well, anyways. :)

[22:23] <pmichaud> for NQP, we needa  -L option anyway

[22:23] <pmichaud> so that's a possibility also

[22:23] <jnthn> Already added something like that, I think.

[22:23] <pmichaud> so, -L then

[22:24] *** mtk left
[22:24] <pmichaud> for NQP I'd either suggest having an NQPLIB or using -L

[22:24] <jnthn> Will try and fix those bits up soon...right now I'm mostly focused on getting to the point where @other can give in.

[22:25] <pmichaud> maybe I can pitch in on that tomorrow. today I've managed to eliminate a lot of @other_tasks

[22:25] <jnthn> Should have attributes and methods mostly in place by tomorrow.

[22:25] <jnthn> Need to sort out multi-dispatch soonish.
