[11:21] <Tene> jnthn: do you currently have plans for making it easier for 6model users to add their own reprs?

[11:21] <jnthn> Tene: It's not near the top of my list, but it's something that I know should be better.

[11:21] <Tene> 'k

[11:22] <jnthn> Tene: Do you have an immediate need to do so?

[11:23] <Tene> I'm considering trying some custom reprs for cardinal

[11:23] <Tene> I can just add them to REPR_initialize_registry in a fork or something

[11:24] <jnthn> *nod*

[11:24] <jnthn> Do that for now, then we can work out something better.

[11:25] <Tene> I finally sat down and drew out some charts for working out where I was confused in my previous ruby-6model impl

[11:26] <dalek> specs: 9019a8e | moritz++ | S32-setting-library/Numeric.pod:

[11:26] <dalek> specs: [S32/Numeric] Real.base: $base <= 36, upper case in result

[11:26] <dalek> specs: review: https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/9019a8e140

[11:27] <Tene> I still find myself confused by exactly what repr_type_object_for means.

[11:28] <Tene> "creates a new type object of this representation and associates it with the given HOW"

[11:29] <jnthn> Read "how" as "meta-object"

[11:30] <jnthn> Basically it creates a type based on a repr/meta-object pairing, and gives you back a handle do it.

[11:30] <jnthn> *to it

[11:31] <jnthn> You can then use repr_instance_of on that handle to get an instance.

[11:32] <Tene> so the type object is just a meta-object with a repr stuck on, and the purpose of that is indicating what repr to use when instantiating the given type object.

[11:34] *** Axius joined
[11:36] <jnthn> Kinda. It's not really a meta-object at all - it's more like a way of talking about a meta-object and repr pairing.

[11:36] <jnthn> For: anObject = MyClass.new(parameters)

[11:36] <Tene> Ah.

[11:37] <jnthn> That new method should somehow be able to locate the type object and call repr_instance_of on it 

[11:37] <jnthn> I guess anyway

[11:37] <jnthn> I'm not familiar enough with Ruby to know exactly how that should be factored.

[11:39] <jnthn> Part of me suspects the Class class has an attribute $!instantiation_handle which the new method of it calls repr_instance_of on.

[11:41] <Tene> the actual ruby soruce has two structs used, RObject which is a subset of RClass.  They both have an RBasic, which is a class pointer and some flags, and a hash holding instance attributes.  RClass also has a hash for holding methods, and a superclass pointer.

[11:43] <Tene> I was thinking that I should try writing an RClass repr, and maybe an RObject repr.

[11:44] <Tene> I *could* get away with just a HashAttrStore, though, just fine.

[11:50] <jnthn> Tene: It feels to me like RBasic playing the repr-ish role here, while RObject and RClass are more like meta-objects.

[11:51] <jnthn> I suspect that making a few reprs would actually work.

[11:52] <Tene> The actual symptom of whatever I was doing wrong before was that if I defined a method on Class, it was available on actual terminal object instances, so I was confusing instance-of and inherits-from

[11:53] <jnthn> Where do class methods live in the Ruby factoring?

[11:56] <Tene> all method lookup is always: given an object, first fetch its -> klass pointer from the RBasic, which should be a pointer to an RClass, or nil.  Given that class, check its method table, and if you don't find the method, follow that class's -> super pointer.

[11:57] <Tene> so class methods live in the method table of the "eigenclass" of the class object.

[11:57] <moritz> sounds a bit like the type object in Perl 6

[11:58] <moritz> std: do { } while 1

[11:58] <p6eval> std 9f27365: OUTPUT¬´[31m===[0mSORRY![31m===[0m‚ê§Unsupported use of do...while; in Perl 6 please use repeat...while at /tmp/XO2WRRWv0c line 1 (EOF):‚ê§------> [32mdo { } while 1[33m‚èè[31m<EOL>[0m‚ê§Parse failed‚ê§FAILED 00:01 113m‚ê§¬ª

[11:58] <Tene> on any ruby object, you can add in arbitrary extra attributes and methods.  When you do so, ruby inserts an extra object between that object and its class, setting that object's class as the eigenclass's superclass.

[11:59] <jnthn> Ah, interesting.

[12:00] <Tene> So if you define a class Cow, with no class methods or class variables, Cow->klass == Class

[12:00] <jnthn> In Ruby, decidedly Class object != type object.

[12:01] <Tene> If you do have class methods or variables, which are just instance methods or variables on the class object, Cow->klass is the eigenclass for that object, and Cow->klass->super == Class

[12:01] <moritz> ok, I agree now :-)

[12:01] <jnthn> Sounds like in 6model ->klass translates as get_how

[12:02] <Tene> (also Cow->klass->klass == Class)

[12:02] <jnthn> Ah, the meta-loop. :)

[12:02] <Tene> That's how i originally tried to model it, but I screwed it up somewhere.  I need to draw some diagrams and start over.

[12:02] <jnthn> Yeah, that bit is a proper brain tease...

[12:03] *** Axius left
[12:03] <Tene> http://www.hokstad.com/static/rom/rom.png -- dashed lines are ->klass (instance-of), and solid lines are ->super

[12:04] <Tene> that's (allegedly) how the core ruby meta-loop works

[12:04] <Tene> where <foo> is an eigenclass for foo

[12:05] * jnthn tries to take it in :

[12:05] <jnthn> :)

[12:06] <Tene> Module inclusion, for mixins, is done similarly.  You push down an instance of module onto the appropriate pointer.

[12:06] <Tene> if you use 'include', it's affecting instances of the class, so you put it on ->super

[12:06] *** Patterner left
[12:07] <Tene> If you use 'extend', it's affecting the class, so you put it on ->klass

[12:07] <Tene> and in both cases, ->klass of the thing you push in there is Module and ->super is whatever was previously on ->klass or ->super

[12:08] <Tene> http://www.slideshare.net/burkelibbey/rubys-object-model-metaprogramming-and-other-magic?from=ss_embed is my big source for understanding this

[12:11] <Tene> The last time I tried this, I failed at working out how to decouple instance methods from class methods.  Of course, I didn't have an actual plan for anything, much less a model for what's being handled by what, what my type objects are, etc.

[12:13] <jnthn> Tene: That presentation helps but it'll take me a while to digest and come up with a model. :)

[12:13] <Tene> Yeah.

[12:13] <jnthn> Slide 26 is...revealing...

[12:13] <Tene> slide 26 is "eigenclasses are hidden from users"

[12:16] *** woosley joined
[12:17] <Tene> So, I mean, I could have an RObject and RClass HOW, and punt everything up to a higher level, as ruby-level objects

[12:17] *** wamba joined
[12:17] *** masak left
[12:18] <Tene> or I could try to push it down with get_how being equivalent to ->klass

[12:19] <Tene> Ideally, in the end state, I can do static analysis of ruby programs looking for attributes known at compile-time and allocating fixed storage for them, etc.

[12:19] <jnthn> It feels like a lot of the method dispatch that does pointer following could be flattenable too

[12:19] <Tene> Yes, agreed.  real ruby does use a method cache.

[12:20] <jnthn> ah, ok

[12:20] <Tene> or is that not what you mean?

[12:20] <jnthn> Yes, it's what I mean.

[12:22] <Tene> so if get_how is ->klass, is it reasonable for Class to be an instance of Class?  for get_how on Class to return itself?

[12:22] <Tene> or, really, on the eigenclass of Class, but mumble mumble

[12:24] <Tene> Hmm, no, that can't be right, actually.

[12:24] <jnthn> At the top of the NQP hierarchy, get_how on KnowHOW is an instance of KnowHOW.

[12:24] <Tene> because the HOW has to conform to the 6model API, right?

[12:25] <jnthn> The HOW is just something with methods.

[12:25] <jnthn> find_method is currently "special"

[12:25] <jnthn> But I don't plan for it to be that way forever.

[12:26] <jnthn> Tene: I probably need to go through the Ruby presentation a bit more carefully and try to work out a model if I'm going to be more helpful than that. :)

[12:26] <jnthn> *than this

[12:27] <Tene> oh, right, the HOW does shit like publishing a method cache through PIR ops.

[12:27] <jnthn> Yeah, it's where "what being a class" means.

[12:27] <jnthn> *where you define

[12:29] <Tene> actual interoperation with Parrot or other languages should go through a vtable or something, not through methods

[12:29] <Tene> right?

[12:29] * moritz would have expected through methods

[12:30] <jnthn> I think we'll need a way that things can specify an operation => method map

[12:30] <Tene> moritz: well, we just said that a HOW doesn't have to follow any given API

[12:30] <jnthn> So languages are free to have whatever methods they want in their meta-objects, but interop can still work.

[12:31] <moritz> Tene: I wasn't thinking about methods on HOW, but methods on actual instnances

[12:31] <Tene> moritz: Ah, right.

[12:32] <Tene> moritz: but, for example, if I have a class and I want to get an instance out of it, not all languages have a 'new' method on the class.

[12:32] <Tene> if I want to get the parents from a class, or list the methods in a class...

[12:32] <moritz> Tene: that's right. Neither do all languages have classes

[12:33] <moritz> Tene: in that case you can't expect HLL interop to DWYM without knowing stuff about the foreign language

[13:01] <dalek> rakudo: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/705435e1a7

[13:03] <masak> ah, nice. a @conversion table and the minus case.

[13:04] <masak> also, a repeat-while, which also makes a lot more sense.

[13:04] <masak> moritz++

[13:04] <masak> moritz: hm, what about fractional numbers?

[13:05] <masak> there's the problem of infinitely repeating decimals, of course...

[13:05] *** wamba left
[13:05] <masak> but besides that, it feels like a pretty reasonable use case.

[13:06] *** wamba joined
[13:08] <masak> right; I see that. (and that's fine.)

[13:08] <masak> but what about it? how do we address the infinitely repeating decimals thing?

[13:08] <masak> we should probably spec it once we decide, too :)

[13:11] *** Moukeddar joined
[13:16] <moritz> we just handle it like normal number stringification

[13:16] <moritz> just cut off

[13:16] <moritz> at some[tm] point

[13:17] <masak> at some parameterized point?

[13:17] <masak> what's the rounding policy? is it parameterized, too?

[13:18] * moritz doesn't see the need for it

[13:18] <moritz> I'd just say roughly Num machine precision

[16:13] <jnthn> moritz: But by that point we already built the Perl 6 executable.

[16:13] <moritz> ah

[16:13] <jnthn> But it won't do much because it can't find CORE.setting 'cus it didn't build ;-)

[16:13] <jnthn> The build procedure is different now.

[16:14] <jnthn> Just changing the setting won't cause a re-build of perl6 executable...there's no real need to bundle everything into one executable.

[16:15] <tadzik> so settings will be loaded in runtime?

[16:26] <Moukeddar> for example , let's say i'm making a website , let it be  a portal

[16:26] <Moukeddar> or some application

[16:26] <Moukeddar> f.e management app

[16:26] <masak> sure.

[16:26] <moritz> then you start with something very small that runs

[16:27] <moritz> und slowly turn it into something that still runs

[16:27] <Moukeddar> i was talking about the UI

[16:27] <moritz> that applies for the UI too

[16:27] <Moukeddar> and use TDD right ?

[16:27] <masak> only if you understand TDD.

[16:27] <masak> don't do it because we say so.

[16:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Start to refactor package_def so it creates the meta-object at compile time and also looks much more like the one in STD.

[16:28] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/1c04306016

[16:28] <masak> do it once you realize that not doing it is a type of insanity.

[16:28] <Moukeddar> masak, i'm starting to kinda realize it :)

[16:28] <moritz> and also do a project without tests, and compare :-)

[16:28] <Moukeddar> i run into some issues

[16:29] <Moukeddar> methods became buggy and not doing the wor

[16:29] <Moukeddar> work

[16:29] <moritz> that's live

[16:29] <masak> writing tests first is on par with writing documentation first. you don't *have* to do it, but chances are you'll thank yourself later.

[16:29] <Moukeddar> all my previous project were Test-less

[16:29] <masak> also, write code that dies a lot.

[16:29] <masak> that's how you get robust code in the end.

[16:29] <Moukeddar> Bacteria Code?

[16:30] <Moukeddar> brb :) , Tea Time

[16:30] * masak tries to clean up before jnthn arrives :)

[16:31] <masak> why is the entropy always maximal just before I have a guest? wait, don't answer that.

[16:31] <moritz> if your code dies whenever something goes wrong, you are more likely do fix problems as you encounter them, as opposed to defer and forget

[16:31] <masak> I'm starting to like that more and more.

[16:31] <masak> I write code that cries bloody death at the smallest unforseen input.

[16:32] <masak> with the result that I know immediately when unforseen things happen.

[16:32] <moritz> that's why I prefer postgres over mysql these days :-)

[16:32] <masak> it goes against the grain of many Perl 5 built-ins, but it's not that hard to adopt as a habit.

[16:32] <masak> Moose helps a lot with this, too.

[16:32] <sorear> good * #perl6

[16:32] <masak> sorear! \o/

[16:32] <moritz> \o it's sorear 

[16:33] <masak> nowadays when I write objects in Perl 5, I tend to write them as Moose::Manual::Unsweetened.

[16:33] <sorear> Rakudo has --setting now?

[16:33] <moritz> sorear: in the nom branch

[16:33] <moritz> sorear: aka "not really" :-)

[16:34] <tadzik> aka "almost there" :)

[16:35] <masak> aka "the future is here, it's just unevenly distributed"

[16:36] <masak> ...with Git.

[16:40] *** nymacro left
[16:42] <masak> Moukeddar: re "methods became buggy and not doing the work" -- as moritz points out, you just described all kinds of complexity problems. all the architectural stuff that comes after is meant to mitigate the fact that programming is hard and complexity tends to accrue.

[16:42] *** risou joined
[16:46] <masak> (and every design pattern is an instance of Separation of Concerns)

[16:49] <Moukeddar> masak, what i meant that after 'Developing" the methods

[16:49] <Moukeddar> they no longer give the expected results

[16:50] *** REPLeffect left
[16:50] <Moukeddar> Queries gone wrong , bad output

[16:50] <Moukeddar> etc....

[16:50] <masak> sounds like you're in a place where you're ready to appreciate tests, yes.

[16:50] <masak> and remember, *automated* tests.

[16:50] <Moukeddar> what's that ?

[16:50] <masak> not just "testing the code now and then" :)

[16:50] <masak> it's a piece of code that runs your tests.

[16:50] <masak> see, for example, the spectest suite.

[16:51] <masak> https://github.com/perl6/roast

[16:51] <masak> each .t file in there is a small Perl 6 program, running some tests.

[16:51] <masak> and the test output is very simple: "ok" or "not ok".

[16:51] <masak> so that you know if and when things break.

[16:52] <masak> *that's* testing. :)

[16:52] <Moukeddar> i see , there's Test Project in Visual Studio

[16:52] <Moukeddar> very similar

[16:52] <masak> the real benefit comes when you accidentally break something fairly unrelated, and the tests discover it for you.

[16:53] <Moukeddar> to insure the Quality right?

[16:53] <sorear> niecza is pretty slow running tests but it can still test itself better in 2 minutes than I can

[16:53] <masak> also, refactoring suddenly becomes feasible, and the "don't fix it" fear goes away.

[16:53] <sorear> ensure

[16:54] <masak> Moukeddar: what sorear said. what do you mean, "Quality"?

[16:54] <masak> that sounds like a marketing word :P

[16:54] <Moukeddar> hehe

[16:54] <Moukeddar> no  matter how much you enhance , the function will still do it's work

[16:55] <Moukeddar> ensure* yeah :p

[16:55] <masak> but yeah, Quality Assurance involves testing IIUC.

[21:41] <newbee> how can i make an alias for a subset? Example: Gave the name Hour and Minute to: subset Sexadecimal of Int where 0..59;

[21:42] <newbee> s/gave/give/

[21:49] <perimosocordiae> hey #perl6, I'm working on a data mining project using the irclogs from http://irclog.perlgeek.de/ (thanks, moritz)

[21:49] <perimosocordiae> and we're now working on generating conversation summaries (over a day's worth of logs)

[21:50] <perimosocordiae> so I'm wondering if there are any especially memorable days from the last 6 years that we can use as test cases

[21:51] <perimosocordiae> to check if our summarization algorithm picks up the relevant keywords

[21:51] <plobsing> #phasers #rakudosketch and #parrotsketch are by definition notable

[21:52] *** newbee left
[21:54] <perimosocordiae> plobsing: any particular days / events, though?

[21:55] <plobsing> perimosocordiae: no, sorry. it is all a blur to me.

[21:55] <perimosocordiae> we've tested on July 29 2010, the day rakudo star was announced, and that worked pretty well

[23:34] <masak> newbee: in the addition routine, you're trying to assign to the attributes. but the attributes are not rw.

[23:34] <masak> newbee: (that's not the issue you're seeing, but it will be a problem once you fix that)

[23:36] <masak> oh, I know what it is.

[23:37] <masak> newbee: you're overriding the infix:<+> provided by the Perl 6 setting.

[23:37] <masak> so that when you do addition inside of your sub infix:<+>, it recurses. and fails to bind the (now Int) argument to the parameters.

[23:38] *** justatheory joined
[23:38] <flussence> (is there any good reason why operator subs aren't always implicitly multi?)

[23:41] <jnthn> flussence: The proto in the setting probably should make that the case.

[23:41] <jnthn> Rakudo didn't catch up with those just yet.

[23:50] *** colomon joined
[23:55] <masak> jnthn: O RLY?

[23:56] <masak> jnthn: wouldn't an only sub in an inner scope just take precedence over the proto in the outer scope?

[23:57] <jnthn> I thought there was some language in S06 about a proto in scope forcing multiness...

[23:58] <masak> sure. in the same scope.

[23:58] <masak> but the setting is one scope up.

[23:58] <jnthn> I'd read "in scope" as meaning "in a visible scope"

[23:59] <jnthn> hmmm

[23:59] <jnthn> "A C<proto>"

[23:59] <jnthn> also adds an implicit C<multi> to all routines of the same short

[23:59] <jnthn> name within its scope, unless they have an explicit modifier.
