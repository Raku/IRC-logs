[00:11] * sorear is back with some insight into the string problem

[00:11] *** patspam left
[00:11] <sorear> I'm now imagining three "string" types, ByteStr, CodeStr, and Str, which are related to each other like Rat is to Num

[00:12] <sorear> a Str is just graphemes; it doesn't remember the order of its modifiers

[00:12] <sorear> ByteStr is a lossless representation of a buf8 that is simultaneously stringish

[00:12] <sorear> ByteStr->CodeStr->Str are allowable coercions that reduce precision, like Rat->Num, so $bytestr ~ $str is allowed and returns a Str

[00:16] <sorear> "foo" would probably be a ByteStr because there is exactly one way to represent it using non-EBCDIC common encodings

[00:16] *** patspam joined
[00:17] <sorear> likewise "‰∏ä" would be a CodeStr and "√°" would be a Str

[00:18] <sorear> coercions "down" the list, like coercion from Num to Rat, are never done implicitly except for output

[00:19] <arnsholt> What's a CodeStr again?

[00:19] <TimToady> what you have right now, basically

[00:20] <arnsholt> Ah, right. A string of character codes

[00:21] <sorear> observe the difference- ByteStr is an interpreted sequence of bytes, buf8 is an uninterpreted sequence

[00:21] <TimToady> however, I was thinking there were two CodeStr types, named NFC and NFD

[00:22] <TimToady> just as there's a utf8 ByteStr type (supposedly)

[00:22] <sorear> TimToady: what do I do if I want to losslessly process an uninterpreted sequence of (uint where * <= 0x10FFFE) ?

[00:23] <TimToady> there can certainly be a type that doesn't commit, just as buf8 doesn't commit to utf8

[00:24] <TimToady> but you'd better know which it is when you need to know :)

[00:24] <sorear> I am thinking that domain-wise, NFD and NFD are the same as Str

[00:24] <sorear> they just impose different views

[00:25] <sorear> I am now considering how my model of 3 domains maps onto types.

[00:25] <TimToady> NFD and NFC I view as "encodings" of Str at the codepoint level rather than the byte level

[00:25] <sorear> I suspect that the type purely reflects the level of the *view* and can be mixed near-freely with the domain

[00:25] <dalek> roast: dfc142d | (Pawel Pabian)++ | S12-methods/multi.t:

[00:25] <dalek> roast: [S12-methods/multi.t] test for #67024 rakudo should complain about re-definition of non-multi method

[00:25] <dalek> roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/dfc142d791

[00:25] <TimToady> well, the early design of Perl 6 had multiple views on the same string, which is why we have StrPos

[00:26] <sorear> hmm

[00:26] <TimToady> that's supposed to be the same regardless of your view

[00:26] <TimToady> but the multi-level approach has been de-emphasized lately

[00:27] *** lumi__ left
[00:27] <sorear> If we encode views in types there will be some dispatch issues.  NFD $x cannot be used interchangably with a Str

[00:27] *** lumi__ joined
[00:28] <TimToady> which is why parameters should not be declared Str, but Stringy

[00:28] <TimToady> then Coolness can happen

[00:29] <sorear> If I have Stringy $x declared somewhere, I might expect $x.substr(0,1) to do something consistent

[00:29] <sorear> not depend on the runtime type of $x

[00:32] <TimToady> indeed, the feeling was that your 1 would be interpreted as the highest allowed abstraction level in scope

[00:32] <TimToady> so grapheme in the absense of use codes or bytes

[00:34] <TimToady> but there are complexity issues, and I'd like us to at least achieve consistent NFG semantics before we overdesign the whole thing

[00:35] <TimToady> to me that's more important than round-tripping, which can be faked with lower-level types when needed

[00:38] *** lumi__ left
[00:39] *** lumi__ joined
[00:39] <TimToady> as for identity issues, you can't even say for sure in ASCII whether foo and Foo are the same item, unless you know the system.  :)

[00:40] <sorear> axiom 1: say .chars for dir; should work

[00:40] <sorear> axiom 2: .unlink for dir; should work

[00:41] <sorear> this is what I'm starting from

[00:42] <TimToady> I don't see how your #1 can possible work given POSIX's head-in-the-sand attitude to characters

[00:42] <TimToady> *possibly

[00:43] <TimToady> some filesystems *do* know whether filenames are in Unicode

[00:44] *** gbacon joined
[00:46] <sorear> TimToady: it should at least try to work, which means somehow combining the Buf result with the locale encoding and making chars work on the combination when the Buf is parsable

[00:46] <TimToady> and the typical Unixoid answer to #1, look in an env var, is insane

[00:46] <sorear> perhaps it returns a Buf with $!candidate-encoding set and Buf.chars implements DWIM

[00:47] <TimToady> but yes, that's about as good as we can do, when forced to guess

[00:47] <sorear> perhaps it tries parsing internally, and returns Str if it can

[00:47] <sorear> in the latter case Str needs to remember the byte sequence somehow, to make #2 work when there is a flexible encoding

[00:48] <TimToady> perhaps dir looks for a consisten pattern :)

[00:48] <TimToady> *tent

[00:48] <sorear> I beleive Mac OS X/HFS+ requires NFC UTF8 for all filenames, meaning that every filename can be roundtripped to graphemes

[00:48] *** tokuhirom joined
[00:49] <TimToady> I thought Mac tended to bias towards NFD

[00:49] <sorear> that was the least certain letter in the message anyway

[00:49] <TimToady> :)

[00:50] <TimToady> phonetics and phonemics are complementary

[00:51] *** clairvy_ joined
[00:52] <TimToady> but I shy away from NFD not so much because it's an "inefficient" encode but because it's forcing the language user into an "etic" view instead of an "emic" view

[00:52] <TimToady> *encoding

[00:53] <TimToady> and being emic is part of what makes Perl Perl

[00:54] <TimToady> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic

[00:54] *** clairvy left
[01:03] <TimToady> anyway, the etic/emic distinction can happen on multiple levels, so codepoints are an emic view of the more etic byte encoding, but a more etic view of the more emic grapheme view; these distinctions also recur as you go up the human language stack from sounds to words to sentences to texts to cultural events

[01:04] <TimToady> so I am not, in principle, against providing multiple views into an item depending on context

[01:05] <TimToady> but it has to be managed well

[01:05] <TimToady> and I tend to be prejudiced toward the emic since most other computer languages tend the other way, and force the programmer to think about bits and bytes

[01:06] <TimToady> or codepoints, these days...

[11:26] <Frida> i'm not following at all.. am i supose to do that?

[11:26] <masak> kinda ;)

[11:26] <masak> but I can explain.

[11:26] <masak> this last bit.

[11:26] <Frida> tnx

[11:27] <masak> when I go '1 / 7', I get an object called a Rat.

[11:27] <masak> that's short for 'rational number'.

[11:27] <Frida> i dont know if you are talking about youre work here or math..

[11:27] <masak> a bit of both ;)

[11:27] <Frida> oki

[11:27] <masak> ok, so a Rat.

[11:27] <masak> that's a number like x/y

[11:28] <masak> it has a numerator (x) and a denominator (y).

[11:28] <Frida> mhmm.

[11:28] <masak> and you can ask for them separately.

[11:29] <p6eval> rakudo 00a115: OUTPUT¬´7 12‚ê§¬ª

[11:29] <masak> Perl 6 is a bit special because it actually counts using Rats.

[11:29] <masak> most other languages count using floating point, which are just a bunch of decimals.

[11:29] <masak> and so precision often gets lost.

[11:29] *** lumi__ joined
[11:29] <masak> this is actually a big problem!

[11:29] <masak> think of people building bank systems and stuff, and precision gets lost.

[11:30] <masak> not enough people know about the "dangers" of floating point.

[11:30] <Frida> ahh, so you are trying to show me how you buildt your language? and you buidt it using regular math?

[11:30] <masak> yes!

[11:30] <masak> Perl 6 thinks more like people think.

[11:30] <Frida> yay!! that's soo cool..

[11:30] <masak> you know how on your calculator you can do 1 / 9 * 9

[11:30] <masak> and you get back .9999999

[11:31] <masak> that can't happen in Perl 6. because precision is never lost in that way.

[11:31] <Frida> okej.. 

[11:31] <masak> :)

[11:31] <Frida> but what is perl buildt to do?

[11:31] <masak> just solve people's problems in general.

[11:32] <Frida> problems with what?

[11:32] <masak> it's "general-purpose" so it can really do anything.

[11:32] <masak> but it has a number of strengths, of course.

[11:32] <Frida> and those are?

[11:32] <masak> Frida: anything, basically. building a web site. making a budget. chatting with friends.

[11:32] <masak> anything a computer does.

[11:33] <masak> oh, the strengths?

[11:36] <masak> Frida: oh, I'll show you a cool one.

[11:36] <Frida> do it..

[11:36] <masak> Frida: you know how there's all these operators: + - * / and so on.

[11:36] <Frida> yes

[11:36] <masak> but sometimes you'd want a new one, that isn't defined yet.

[11:36] <masak> like, say I want !

[11:37] <masak> and I want N! to mean 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

[11:37] <bbkr> jnthn: so if skipping accessor when method is present is desired behavior maybe I should add another line with dies_ok { $a.foo } to prove it?

[11:48] <masak> maybe minus the adventure game.

[11:49] <masak> Frida: I also wrote a moon lander, a cookie-eating game, hangman, connect-4, and a biggish adventure game.

[11:50] <masak> srsly, being able to play the games right in the blog posts would be a really nice feature.

[14:03] <jnthn> You don't specify anything to go in $!do

[14:04] <jnthn> And the "this is a dispatcher" flag won't get set either

[14:04] <ruoso> maybe there needs to be a mandatory parameter to the initialization, yes

[14:04] *** birdwindupbird joined
[14:04] <jnthn> Well, but that mandatory parameter is kinda...weird. What lives in $!do is highly backend specific.

[14:04] <jnthn> And implementation specific.

[14:05] *** lumi__ left
[14:05] <jnthn> I'm not even sure what you'd pass. :)

[14:05] *** lumi__ joined
[14:05] <ruoso> Well, maybe the default should be to do the same thing as your code did..

[14:06] <ruoso> but with all the meta stuff, I would expect to be able to perform all this in the level of the objects and methods

[14:07] <jnthn> Well, I kinda did, if you see that dummy proto as a constructor. ;)

[14:07] <ruoso> well, that's the Perl 6 syntax to initalize it

[14:07] <jnthn> Maybe a Routine.new_onlystar_dispatcher()

[14:08] <ruoso> I would think that whatever the compiler uses should be available to the user too

[14:09] <ruoso> at least if I was to build a class from scratch, I would expect my new class to be no different than a class generated by the compiler

[14:10] <jnthn> Yeah, that's much less of an issue.

[14:10] <jnthn> The tricky bit with routines is the underlying, VM-level coderef.

[14:11] <benabik> What's the problem with just using pointy blocks?

[14:11] *** pmurias joined
[14:11] <jnthn> benabik: That's a Perl 6 code object.

[14:11] <jnthn> (if you're talking about, what does in $!do)

[14:11] <ruoso> benabik: my question is actually how to get the pointy blocks and compose them into a single multi at run-time

[14:12] <benabik> ruoso: Ahh...

[14:12] *** JimmyZ left
[14:12] <jnthn> I guess we could do a constructor for routine that takes a pointy block and just steals its body and signature.

[14:12] <jnthn> A constructor that creates an onlystar style dispatcher is probably also worthwhile.

[14:13] <ruoso> why can't it be an "empty" routine?

[14:13] <jnthn> ruoso: What's going to get run when you invoke it?

[14:13] <ruoso> nothing

[14:13] <jnthn> ruoso: How is that useful?

[14:13] <ruoso> you could even raise an exception if you try to run an "empty" routine

[14:13] <jnthn> :)

[14:13] *** JimmyZ joined
[14:13] <ruoso> it's just the thing you get to add the candidates later

[14:14] <jnthn> I'm still confused.

[14:14] <ruoso> Ok, let me get the background on this again...

[14:14] <jnthn> When you invoke a proto, it has a body that enters the multi-dispatcher.

[14:14] <ruoso> this use case came from the catalyst-like web dispatching framework

[14:15] <ruoso> basically, it will take some specification of action-chains, based on a reduce of multi-dispatch

[14:15] <ruoso> so the framework takes the specification and build the multi

[14:16] <ruoso> and then invokes the multi with the URL split by / as arguments

[14:16] *** tty234_ is now known as tty234

[14:16] <ruoso> (which will later bring the "reduce with variable-length-signature-multi" problem)

[14:17] <jnthn> Yeah, that one is still unresolved.

[14:17] <jnthn> There was some handwaving about captures being cursor-ish, then no spec changes.

[14:17] <ruoso> that was the reasoning for the first sketches on Iterators

[14:18] <ruoso> you would be able to iterate a capture

[14:18] <masak> .WALK &

[14:18] *** lumi__ left
[14:19] <jnthn> ruoso: Yeah. I never really liked any of that line of thougth.

[14:19] *** lumi__ joined
[14:19] <jnthn> It's like, "let's take this thing that needs to be fast because we do it a lot. Now let's make it even more complex!"

[14:20] <jnthn> I agree that Routine (well, Code in general) probably needs some more useful constructors, though.

[14:21] <jnthn> But I'm reluctant on Routine.new() magically giving back something with an onlystar dispatcher in it.

[14:22] <jnthn> Maybe Routine.new(:dispatcher) can do that

[14:23] <ruoso> that looks like a sane API

[14:23] <ruoso> btw... about the reduce... maybe the complexity needs to be in the code for reduce, not on Capture

[14:24] <jnthn> That'd be more comfortable.

[14:24] <ruoso> it would just take all signatures, try from the shorter to the longer

[14:27] <benabik> I would assume you'd want to try longer sigs first so that ($a, $b) would match before (*@a)

[14:27] <benabik> Although if you have a slurpy as a candidate on variable length multi, you're probably asking to have problems.

[14:28] <ruoso> *@a is the longest posible

[14:29] <jnthn> Well, it's longest but also least specific, in a sense.

[14:29] <jnthn> A normal multi-dispatch would consider the absolute match a better one than the slurpy one.

[14:29] <jnthn> It's possible the answer really is "build a custom dispatcher"

[14:30] <jnthn> Since Perl 6 multi-dispatch isn't a longest-matching based thing.

[15:32] <masak> I have the numbers not lining up over here. (Chrome 13, Ubuntu)

[15:32] <felher> masak: yeah, well, i just started to read your code and i won't ask any other than stylistic questions before i'm done :)

[15:33] <masak> erez: been too long since I looked at it, to be honest. :/

[15:33] <masak> erez: I think there's a TODO list in the repository.

[15:33] <jnthn> masak: It sometimes happens to me if I've got antying other than default text size.

[15:33] <masak> oh!

[15:33] <masak> jnthn: that fixed it, thanks.

[15:34] <masak> felher: I tend to use given/when/default to test the various properties of one single thing. I tend to use if/elsif/else to test a cascade of conditions on different things.

[15:36] <felher> masak: k, thnx :)

[15:36] <masak> felher: it was a good question. thank *you*. :)

[15:37] <jnthn> tadzik: Not much, if at all. And if it was, only because b cheated badly in various places.

[15:37] <tadzik> I see

[15:37] <masak> if (%!t{$!cp} // -> %, @ {;})({%!p}, @.e) -> $_ { # one of the advantages of Perl 6 is that it's so much more legible than Perl 5...

[15:37] <jnthn> O.O

[15:37] <tadzik> eew

[15:37] <felher> masak: :D

[15:37] <masak> complexity. it creeps up on you.

[15:38] <tadzik> isn't that intentionally obfuscated?

[15:38] <masak> no... :/

[15:38] <tadzik> (%!t{$!cp} // -> %, @ {;})

[15:38] <tadzik> why do you pass % and @ to an empty block?

[15:38] <jnthn> It's a sig.

[15:38] <masak> tadzik: because that's what I call it with right after that paren.

[15:38] <tadzik> oh

[15:39] <jnthn> There musta been a neater way to write that

[15:39] <jnthn> It took me a while to parse :P

[15:39] <masak> couldv'e factored the empty pblock out into a variable to make it clearer.

[15:39] <tadzik> what is that supposed to be doing?

[15:39] <flussence> .oO( things like that are the reason I never abbreviate names in code any more... )

[15:39] <jnthn> Why {%!p} and not just %!p?

[15:39] *** Sarten-X joined
[15:39] <masak> tadzik: pull out the player's trading callback, or if there isn't any, an empty thing. call it.

[15:40] <benabik> masak: Why not just avoid the call if there is no callback?

[15:40] <tadzik> oh, so it's an empty block, but it has to take parameters

[15:40] <masak> jnthn: because of the p6l thread.

[15:40] <tadzik> couldn't they be slurpy then? If the block doesn't care anyway

[15:40] <jnthn> masak: ah

[15:40] <masak> jnthn: can't trust the clients.

[15:40] <masak> benabik: would've been better. at the time I was aiming for brevity.

[15:41] <masak> tadzik: it could indeed've.

[15:41] <tadzik> I'd probably go for sub(%, @) {} instead of -> %, @ {;}

[15:42] <tadzik> looks more like... code :)

[15:42] <tadzik> I can see the reasons why you'd write it that way though

[15:43] <masak> over time, I'll probably re-write farm.pl not to be so darn abbreviated.

[15:43] <masak> I still think the brevity was worthwhile to pull out the "essence" of the code.

[15:44] <masak> but it's filled its purpose now.

[15:46] *** lumi__ left
[15:47] <masak> JimmyZ: 'has' scopes the variable within an instance. 'my' scopes the variable within the 'class' block.

[15:47] *** lumi__ joined
[15:47] <JimmyZ> which looks like private static attr in Java?

[15:48] <jnthn> JimmyZ: Yes, it'll have the same lifetime and scope.

[15:54] <masak> tadzik: a module is a package with a few extras.

[15:54] <masak> tadzik: things like auth and ver, IIRC.

[15:54] <JimmyZ> that's why I was confused

[15:54] <masak> tadzik: oh, and export semantics.

[15:54] <tadzik> optional

[15:55] <tadzik> so it's a superset?

[15:55] <masak> yes.

[15:55] <JimmyZ> package is a  superset ?

[15:55] <masak> just like a class is a superset of a module, in a way.

[15:55] <masak> no, module is a superset.

[15:56] <JimmyZ> class is a superset  of module? I thought module is superset of class

[15:56] <jnthn> Package also fills the "we didn't define anything with this name yet, but need a stash here" role.

[15:56] <JimmyZ> I thought package > module > class

[15:57] <jnthn> class Foo::Bar { } # Foo is a package

[15:57] <masak> JimmyZ: what gave you the idea that a package is more powerful than a *class*?

[15:58] <JimmyZ> package can have many class :)

[15:58] <masak> o.O

[15:58] *** lumi__ left
[15:58] <jnthn> Well, only in the sense that a class can have many classes... :)

[15:58] <jnthn> Here's how it works. Every type has a .WHO slot. Off this hangs a Stash.

[15:58] <JimmyZ> class Foo::Bar { } # Foo is a package # I understand this one

[15:59] *** lumi__ joined
[15:59] <jnthn> So Foo::Bar is really Foo.WHO.<Bar>

[15:59] <JimmyZ> and module?

[16:00] <jnthn> If you had class Foo { }; class Foo::Bar { }, Foo.WHO.<Bar> still works just the same. The only difference is that Foo has a different meta-object.

[16:00] <jnthn> Same story for module. Just a different meta-object.

[16:00] <jnthn> package is just a bit more special to the compiler

[16:00] <jnthn> because it knows not to while about redefinition.

[20:24] <pmurias> it's better to have one decent backend then a dozen ones which are not good enough

[20:25] <masak> agree.

[20:27] <pmurias> and niecza has quite a few opcodes so writing a backend for that is not a trivial thing (as opposed to Perlito which has a relatively simple AST)

[22:22] <pmurias> sorear: yes, implementing most of the ops won't be hard, but there is still a bunch of them ;)

[22:23] <pmurias> sorear: are strings builtin into mono?

[22:23] <sorear> yes, for moderate values of "builtin"

[22:24] <sorear> semantically, they're just another class in the standard library

[22:26] <pmurias> what i'm curious if they are treated extra fast?

[22:27] <snarkyboojum> sorear: FWIW - it's just a stream of "[0xac93a2c0:] EXCEPTION handling: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object" errors - not very meaningful to me

[22:27] <sorear> snarkyboojum: nothing between the lines?  that's what I thought

[22:28] <snarkyboojum> sorear: nothing else - just that spewed out until mono dumps

[22:28] <sorear> snarkyboojum: would you nopaste the last ~50 lines of the --trace=all output?

[22:29] <snarkyboojum> sorear: sure - https://gist.github.com/1210215

[22:30] <sorear> snarkyboojum: that looks like --trace=none output

[22:30] <snarkyboojum> eek - that was with trace=none :D

[22:31] <snarkyboojum> sorear: try again :)

[22:36] <snarkyboojum> sorear: I reckon it's something wonky with my mono install post upgrade - probably best that I not waste your time with this..

[22:37] <snarkyboojum> sorear: like http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td3562696 :|

[22:39] <snarkyboojum> sorear: thanks for your help - I'm just going to try a later version of mono - definitely not a Niecza problem I'd say

[22:44] *** lumi__ left
[22:44] <sorear> snarkyboojum: ...yes, your mono install is _wonky-

[22:44] <jnthn> sleep &

[22:44] <sorear> I mean seriously, you have null pointers in your NullPointerException class structure

[22:48] <snarkyboojum> sorear: aye - craziness :D

[22:48] <snarkyboojum> pretty impressive breakage between OS releases

[23:00] <snarkyboojum> so in summary - don't try and run Mono 2.8.2 on OS X Lion - it appears horribly broken.

[23:00] <snarkyboojum> 2.10.5 works nicely however, and I now have a working Niecza again :)

[23:00] *** PacoLinux left
[23:00] *** PacoLinux_ is now known as PacoLinux

[23:05] <snarkyboojum> and next time I'll do my homework a little more thoroughly :|

[23:07] <sorear> snarkyboojum: wanna close the bug?

[23:08] <snarkyboojum> sorear: sure - and thanks again :)
