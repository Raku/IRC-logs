[00:04] <sorear> arnsholt: pong

[00:04] <phenny> sorear: 18 May 17:57Z <arnsholt> tell sorear I'm read Devanagari (of the Sanskrit variety, slightly different rules than the Hindi one) and Wikpedia-familiar with Arabic script. What do you need to know?

[00:09] *** ymasory joined
[00:10] *** risou_ is now known as risou_awy

[00:11] <sorear> pmichaud: where are sin.p6 &c from?  I'd like to make niecza run them :>

[00:11] <sorear> arnsholt: I think I really need a native user of an abugida, since my question is as much cultural as technical

[00:12] * whiteknight has to look up "abugida" in wikipedia

[00:13] *** jevin joined
[00:13] <sorear> arnsholt: I want to know if a native Devanagari user would expect, for instance, substr() to treat consonant clusters as a unit

[00:20] *** ymasory left
[00:28] <TimToady> sorear: we don't really have to worry about that unless Unicode defines that in their language independent support level

[00:28] <TimToady> and if someone says "use Devanagari;" then it's whoever writes that module that worries about it

[00:29] *** Chillance left
[00:31] <TimToady> default grapheme support in Perl 6 is *not* language dependent

[00:31] <arnsholt> sorear: That's a good question, but I think the right semantics for substr on Devanagari would be to no treat each syllable as atomic

[00:31] <arnsholt> They certainly aren't at the Unicode level, or at the language level

[00:32] <sorear> TimToady: I'm putting myself in the role of someone writing use Devanagari;

[00:32] <sorear> TimToady: or rather use Hindi

[00:32] <arnsholt> (Of course there's a lot of shenanigans going on in Sanskrit with sandhi and stuff, but that's linguistics, not character set)

[00:32] <sorear> TimToady: I think that the longer we put off thinking about language support modules, the harder it'll be

[00:33] <sorear> tadzik: ping

[00:33] *** jaldhar joined
[00:33] <sorear> tadzik: use Polish; "czas".comb.perl.say # ?

[00:33] <sorear> wikipedia thinks "cz" is a polish letter

[00:34] <TimToady> it just seems to me like NFG with slightly different "grapheme faking" rules

[00:35] <TimToady> in the same sense that "ch" is an English letter

[00:36] <TimToady> as far as the linguistics goes, it's just a digraph, though of course cultures can differ on collation rules

[00:37] *** ymasory joined
[00:45] <TimToady> anyway, yes, it's an interesting problem, but also sort of an open-ended problem, so I'd also to keep in mind that merely doing language-independent graphemes instead of codepoints would be raising the state of the art considerably

[00:45] *** jferrero left
[00:48] <pmichaud> sorear: they're in the bench subdirectory of the rpbench repository

[00:48] <pmichaud> (getting url)

[00:49] <pmichaud> https://github.com/pmichaud/rpbench/tree/master/bench

[00:49] <sorear> thanks

[00:49] <pmichaud> any modules they need are in https://github.com/pmichaud/rpbench/tree/master/files (for now, I may switch to a lib/ subdir)

[00:49] <pmichaud> I was thinking of adding niecza to the tests as well

[00:51] <sorear> running sin.t is probably a ways off yet

[00:51] <pmichaud> okay

[00:51] <pmichaud> anyway, I'd be very interested in adding niecza to this mix whenever you think we're getting close to that

[00:51] <pmichaud> in fact, that's part of the reason I switch from "rakbench" to "rpbench", so it's not so obviously rakudo-oriented

[00:52] <pmichaud> *switched

[00:52] <pmichaud> I figure I can come up with lots of things to put in for 'r' and 'p' that don't have to be 'Rakudo' and 'Parrot" :-)

[00:53] <sorear> I guess full numerics should be my top priority

[00:53] <sorear> I wonder how long I can get away without a Numeric role

[00:53] <pmichaud> rakudo got along for quite a while w/o one :)

[00:54] <pmichaud> of course, that was before Perl 6 really had one either, which made it easier.  might be much harder now.

[00:54] <sorear> I wonder if making 'class Numeric is Cool {} class Num is Numeric {}' would be a useful cheat

[00:54] *** dayangkun left
[00:54] <sorear> (because niecza's role support is still extremely limited)

[01:00] *** lumi_ joined
[01:02] <sorear> TimToady: I wonder if we should draw a (typological or other) distinction between codepoint-strings and grapheme-strings

[01:02] <sorear> much as we currently distinguish Buf and Str; byte operations on Str require an encoding

[01:20] <sorear> on the other hand, if we kept all strings in codepoint form, we could mostly fake grapheme operations

[01:21] <sorear> except for === (don't use that unless you truly care about NF)

[04:54] <tadzik> the fundamental problem of releases

[04:54] <tadzik> what pm group do you originate from?

[04:55] <jdhore> mine's been used. New York

[04:55] <tadzik> YAPC::Russia was in Moscow, right?

[04:56] <tadzik> yeah, looks so

[04:56] <jdhore> yep

[04:57] <jdhore>   2010-04-22   Rakudo #28 "Moscow"             (moritz)

[04:57] <jdhore> dammit

[04:58] <tadzik> sort the contributors by the number of commits, then check for pm group for the topmost ones maybe :)

[04:58] <tadzik> No idea, I don't know about the PM group with a significant Perl 6 contribution recently

[05:00] <jdhore> I suppose I could be lazy and just pick randomly

[05:01] <tadzik> pick some random one, maybe they'll notice and that'd motivate them :)

[05:01] <jdhore> :P

[05:01] * perigrin votes for Dahut.pm

[05:01] <perigrin> (but then I'm biased)

[05:01] <jdhore> Where/What is Dahut?

[05:02] <perigrin> Dahut.pm is the group organizing YAPC::NA

[05:02] <perigrin> http://dahut.pm.org

[05:02] <perigrin> They (we?) are non-geographical too

[05:03] <tadzik> oh, like Zebras.pm! *snicker*

[05:03] <jdhore> that actually looks like it might be the best. Technically we are all members of Dahut

[05:03] <perigrin> Less stripey

[05:04] <tadzik> int eresting;

[05:04] <perigrin> tadzik: also you don't get more Random than a Dahut

[05:04] <tadzik> :) fair enough

[05:04] <perigrin> trust me we're pretty tangential and irreverant as a group

[05:05] <jdhore> after ZA.pm in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa because the denizens of #perl6 have an unusual facination with zebras and ZA just happens to have a "Z" and, according to my meager research, there are indeed zebras in the area <--- LIES

[05:06] <tadzik> where's that from?

[05:06] <jdhore> the April Rakudo release announcement

[05:06] <tadzik> oh, right

[05:06] <tadzik> what is the LIE here?

[05:07] <jdhore> LIE? Long Island Expressway?

[05:07] <tadzik> dunno, I'm asking :)

[05:07] <jdhore> oh

[05:07] <jdhore> There are no zebras in South Africa

[05:07] <tadzik> that doesn't make the statement a lie.

[05:07] <jdhore> Well, there ARE, but they're in zoos

[05:07] <perigrin> and the fascination is *not* unusual ... zebras are fascinating creatures.

[05:08] <perigrin> jdhore: so you admit that there are zebras in the area ...

[05:08] <tadzik> "according to my meager research" – the research could be wrong, and the statement is absolutely right :)

[05:08] <jdhore> wait wait wait

[05:08] <jdhore> Is there an Antarctica PM group?

[05:08] <perigrin> Not that I'm aware of.

[05:08] <tadzik> ha ha :)

[05:08] <jdhore> shit

[05:08] <perigrin> There were patches from .aq

[05:08] <jdhore> I wanted to make a Penguins joke

[05:08] <perigrin> but I dont' think they have a PM group down there.

[05:08] <tadzik> hehe

[05:09] <perigrin> you could go with PGH.pm then

[07:58] <jdhore> moritz, yes it is

[07:58] <Su-Shee> funnily, it was the very first thing I got right and understood when I started learning to program. I have no idea why.

[07:59] * perigrin is a 9 hour drive from Asheville, that hasn't stopped him from planning a YAPC there.

[08:01] <moritz> general question for rakudo devs and users: what do you think about just giving star releases (or compiler releases used for star) release names?

[08:02] <moritz> I found that finding a good name is the hardest part of a release, and that would decrease the burden

[08:02] <jdhore> I find that part rather fun

[08:04] <Su-Shee> moritz: honestly, I don't care wether a release has a name or not. I'm perfectly fine with "rakudo-november-2010" or "rakudo-star-first-quarter-2010" or something.

[08:05] <Su-Shee> moritz: I'd even install it if you start calling it "rakudo rolling rabbit" and "rakudo rancid rochefort"..

[08:06] <moritz> lol

[08:06] <jdhore> "rakudo oscillating ocelot"

[08:06] <Su-Shee> jdhore: that's not starting with r.. ;)

[08:07] <jdhore> Su-Shee, oh, I see

[08:07] <Su-Shee> well if I think about it.. rakudo rock and roll? ;)

[12:07] <pmichaud> good morning, #perl6

[12:08] <pmichaud> bbkr_: you've been able to successfully build previous releases?

[12:10] <takadonet> pmichaud: morning

[12:11] <pmichaud> (release names for star) -- I think I'd prefer to keep giving names to compiler releases

[12:11] <pmichaud> we can gives names to star releases also, but I'd prefer that to form a different series :-)

[12:11] <pmichaud> besides, we have plenty of .pm cities to choose from.  We can make it clearer that there doesn't have to be a justification for a name beyond "I picked it from a list"

[12:16] <bbkr_> pmichaud: 2011-04 fails with the same error (same parrot version I assume). command that follows this failure is "Command failed (status 512): make install-dev".

[12:16] <pmichaud> 2011.04 had a different parrot version

[12:17] <pmichaud> 2011.04 was running parrot 3.3.0

[12:17] <moritz> bbkr_: it sounds like parrot has problems chosing a compiler

[12:20] <bbkr_> different? 2011.05 release wants to download also parrot 3_3_0

[12:21] <moritz> it should use 3_4_0

[12:21] * moritz hasn't actually tried the release

[12:21] <pmichaud> pmichaud@orange:~/perl/rakudo-2011.05$ cat build/PARROT_REVISION

[17:01] *** JimmyZ_ left
[17:01] <colomon> okay, I'll cross my fingers and give it a try

[17:01] <pmichaud> we seemed to be having trouble dealing with null pmcs

[17:01] <pmichaud> but I was also not sure what "correct behavior" is/was

[17:01] <pmichaud> so yes, testing would be very helpful

[17:02] <pmichaud> do you need the patch?

[17:02] <colomon> oh, probably.

[17:02] <colomon> (I need to figure out how to get git back on the main branch instead of back two months.)

[17:02] <colomon> git checkout master?

[17:03] <pmichaud> https://gist.github.com/976023

[17:03] <benabik> colomon: That should do it.

[17:03] <pmichaud> yes, git checkout master should work

[17:03] *** dakkar left

[17:04] <colomon> any profiling progress?  I apologize for not getting any done myself yet.

[17:05] <pmichaud> I've been working on cleaning up the benchmark suite, mostly

[17:12] *** risou is now known as risou_awy

[17:12] <colomon> hmmm, PCRE bug is still in there.

[17:12] <pmichaud> ...pcre bug?

[17:13] <colomon> in Parrot

[17:13] <colomon> that's the one I had such trouble reporting last week

[17:13] <pmichaud> yes, but what's the actual bug?

[17:14] <colomon> Failed to load libpcre

[17:14] <colomon> current instr.: 'parrot;PCRE;init' pc 0 (runtime/parrot/library/pcre.pir:57)

[17:14] <colomon> .... # deleted by colomon

[17:14] <colomon> gmake: *** [src/glut_nci_thunks.c] Error 1

[17:14] <colomon> Command failed (status 512): gmake install-dev

[17:14] <colomon> that's during perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot

[17:15] <pmichaud> oh, ouch

[17:15] <pmichaud> is that because you don't have libpcre on your system, maybe?

[17:16] <colomon> as far as I know I have it.

[17:16] <tadzik> to me it started occuring after some pcre update

[17:16] <tadzik> gee, I'm sleepy

[17:16] <colomon> I've got a /opt/local/lib/libpcre.a

[17:16] <pmichaud> how about a .so?

[17:17] <pmichaud> (I can never keep track of .a versus .so anymore)

[17:17] <colomon> I've got a .dylib, which is the os x equivalent of .so, so far as I know.

[17:17] <pmichaud> okay

[17:17] <colomon> anyway, building --without-pcre now

[17:17] <pmichaud> anyway, I was getting a pcre error also -- I ended up doing make realcleans or equivalent and that got around the issue

[17:18] <pmichaud> have you tried building just a "bare parrot"?

[17:18] <pmichaud> i.e., fresh parrot output, see if it builds?

[17:18] <pmichaud> s/parrot output/parrot checkout/

[17:18] <colomon> I've tried fresh parrot directories repeatedly, but I've always tried building it with --gen-parrot

[17:19] <pmichaud> rakudo: say (83/220).Num

[17:19] <p6eval> rakudo 786099: OUTPUT«0.377272727272727␤»

[17:19] <pmichaud> rakudo: say (83/220*60).Num

[17:19] <p6eval> rakudo 786099: OUTPUT«22.6363636363636␤»

[17:19] <pmichaud> maybe just try building a new parrot and see if you still get the error

[17:20] <pmichaud> (is this the same error that led to us trying to get a trac ticket written, and all of that...?)

[17:21] <pmichaud> the ticket is waiting for more details

[17:22] <pmichaud> I'll write some details for the ticket.

[17:22] <colomon> yes, this is that error

[17:22] <colomon> trying to clone parrot now in another tab.  :)

[17:23] <pmichaud> yes, that would be good

[17:23] <pmichaud> let's see if it happens for a standalone parrot build

[17:23] *** risou_awy is now known as risou_

[17:23] <tadzik> colomon: you're on a mac, have you tried Termkit yet?

[17:23] *** risou joined
[17:24] <colomon> tadzik: I haven't.  In fact, if you poke around in the HN feed on TermKit, you can see me complaining several times that TermKit looked like exactly what I *didn't* want from my terminal.  :)

[17:24] <tadzik> ;)

[17:24] <pmichaud> lol

[17:25] <tadzik> actually, I see more of a 'file-manager-and-everything-but-keyboard-driven' than a terminal in it

[17:25] <pmichaud> I have a keyboard driven file manager.

[17:25] <tadzik> which is exactly something I may want :)

[17:25] <pmichaud> to copy a file, I just type "cp" :-)

[17:25] <pmichaud> to see what files I have, I type "ls" :-)

[17:25] <tadzik> yeah, I do that too :)

[17:25] <colomon> I'm pretty comfortable with the division between terminal and the OS X GUI.

[17:26] * moritz wants a terminal that just works normally, but also allows pixel graphics to be printed in the terminal

[17:26] <pmichaud> it took me forever to find a terminal program I liked

[17:26] <tadzik> Recently moved from mutt to kmail and I'm amazed that it can be configured to do almost everything with a keyboard

[17:26] <colomon> If I wanted a change, it would be along the lines of more efficient ways to launch GUI stuff from the terminal.

[17:26] <moritz> a bit like framebuffer under linux, but iirc that only allows fullscreen images

[17:26] <pmichaud> colomon: hotkeys?

[17:27] <pmichaud> or literally from a terminal?

[17:27] <tadzik> colomon: like a desktop shell?

[17:27] * tadzik makes a screenshot

[17:27] <pmichaud> I'm completely addicted to my hotkeys.

[17:27] <colomon> literally from the terminal.  In the HN thread, I suggested having an lsf command, which takes ls's syntax but opens a Finder window to display the resulting file list.  :)

[17:28] <colomon> OS X already has "open", which is incredibly handy.  

[17:28] <tadzik> that's what xdg-open wants to be, methinks

[17:34] <colomon> pmichaud: pcre build failure happens on a standalone parrot build too.

[17:34] <pmichaud> colomon: okay, good to know.

[17:34] <pmichaud> maybe I can bump the ticket

[17:35] <Su-Shee> ah.. the quest for the perfect gui.. ;)

[17:35] <pmichaud> if we do a star release, we might need to --without-pcre the build, then.

[17:37] <pmichaud> colomon: perhaps you should add your system details to TT#2107, so others can start to reproduce/fix

[17:37] <colomon> pmichaud: I thought that was the purpose of that parrot bug reporting script I ran?

[17:37] <pmichaud> oh, it's there

[17:37] <pmichaud> it's in an attachment, I guess

[17:38] <colomon> yes

[17:39] <pmichaud> I'll bump the ticket priority

[17:42] <pmichaud> actually, I won't

[17:42] <pmichaud> because I can't

[17:44] <colomon> pmichaud: Null PMC access in type() when I try Math::BigInt under the new patched zavolaj

[17:44] <colomon> which is I guess is sort of an improvement.  :)

[17:45] <pmichaud> I should look at Math::BigInt, then

[17:45] *** spq left
[17:45] <pmichaud> what's the most recent version of rakudo/zavolaj where Math::BigInt worked?

[17:45] *** spq1 joined
[17:46] <colomon> It worked under March release.

[17:46] <colomon> I don't think it worked under April.

[17:46] <pmichaud> march release of rakudo?  okay, that helps to know

[17:46] <colomon> pmichaud: The original show-stopped was the "t" type depreciation.  

[17:46] <colomon> *stopper

[17:47] <pmichaud> one of the issues I had with working on zavolaj with mysql is that it's a pain to have all of the mysql stuff in the way.  bigint might be much simpler

[17:47] <pmichaud> we've restored a version of 't'

[17:47] <pmichaud> but null pmc handling seems to be a bit of an issue now

[17:50] <colomon> Interesting.  It looks like it's dying when I call the function to free a string I've allocated for the BigDigits C library.

[17:50] <colomon> there shouldn't be a null pointer involved, so far as I know.

[17:51] <sjohnson> yo colomon 

[17:51] <pmichaud> if there's a function that returns NULL as a status/error code, it can be an issue

[17:51] <colomon> sub bdSolFree(OpaquePointer $p) is native("libbd") { ... }

[17:52] <colomon> nothing returned at all, so far as I know.

[17:52] <pmichaud> I can't find "libbd"

[17:53] <pmichaud> "binary decision-diagram library?"

[17:53] <pmichaud> no, that's libbdd

[17:53] <pmichaud> hmmmm

[17:54] <colomon> https://github.com/colomon/Math-BigInt  -- look in the readme.  :)

[17:55] <pmichaud> yeah, found it

[17:56] <pmichaud> where's "bigd.c", "bigd.h", etc.?

[17:56] <colomon> yeah, bdSolFree definitely returns void

[17:56] <pmichaud> oh, we fetch it

[17:57] <colomon> http://www.di-mgt.com.au/src/BigDigits.2.2.0.zip

[17:57] <pmichaud> grrrrrr

[17:57] <colomon> well, you have to fetch it by hand, yeah.  And then use the tools in build-BigDigit to get the build.

[17:57] <colomon> what's up?

[17:57] <pmichaud> I don't like zip files that unpack all of the contents into the current directory

[17:58] <pmichaud> (yes, I know, create a directory first... I was being lazy this time)

[17:58] <colomon> I agree, but I think the readme instructions expect you to unpack in the build-BigDigit directory.

[17:58] <pmichaud> I just wanted to look at the source

[17:58] <colomon> yes

[17:58] <colomon> ah

[17:58] <pmichaud> I'm sure you've been asked this already... but why not use libgmp?

[17:59] *** mj41 left
[17:59] <colomon> libgmp doesn't support my build of OS X.

[18:00] <pmichaud> that would be why, then.

[18:00] <colomon> seemed like a very good reason not to use it  :)

[18:00] <colomon> other than that, it's miles beyond BigDigits, I think

[18:00] <pmichaud> yeah, I agree.

[18:01] <colomon> I've been meaning to try to figure out how the heck other portable systems (like Python) support libgmp

[18:02] *** envi left
[18:04] <pmichaud> I can't find a bdSolFree function in the bigdigits code

[18:04] *** spq1 left
[18:04] *** hercynium left
[18:04] <colomon> right, it's in build-BigDigit in Math-BigInt

[18:04] <pmichaud> oh, maybe I aborted the download

[18:04] <colomon> bigSol.c is the filename

[18:04] <colomon> I think you might be able to guess who wrote it.  ;)

[18:05] <colomon> It's just 

[18:05] <colomon> void

[18:05] <colomon> bdSolFree(void *p) {

[18:05] <colomon>     free(p);

[18:05] <colomon> }

[18:05] <pmichaud> okay

[18:05] <pmichaud> I'll have to try all of this a bit later when I get home

[18:05] <colomon> I seem to recall there was some annoying conflict if I just called "free" directly.

[18:05] <pmichaud> might be the same conflict :)

[18:05] <pmichaud> but it might also be gone, now

[18:06] *** tyatpi_ joined
[18:06] <colomon> It might have been as simple as I didn't figure out that is native("") is zavolaj's way of calling system functions, and so couldn't find a portable way to do it.  

[18:07] <colomon> (Dunno if it builds on windows, but Math::BigInt has been tested on OS X and Linux.  :)

[18:07] <pmichaud> it would likely be really good to figure out how to get libgmp support into Rakudo

[18:08] <colomon> huh.  according to the stack trace,         default { -> \$x { $x } }      is the line of crash?

[18:08] <colomon> pmichaud: agree 100% on libgmp and Rakudo

[18:08] <pmichaud> stack trace gets a little weird when dealing with closures

[18:08] <pmichaud> that function returns a closure which is then called later

[18:08] *** slavik1 left
[18:08] <colomon> oh, and the closure is the line of the error?

[18:08] <pmichaud> probably

[18:08] *** [hercynium] joined
[18:09] <pmichaud> it's where the null pmc manifests, I think

[18:09] *** slavik1 joined
[18:09] *** envi joined
[18:11] <pmichaud> anyway, I have to run for a while -- I'll install and look at it all a bit later

[18:12] <colomon> one sec, if you can...

[18:12] <benabik> One of the Parrot GSoC projects is GMP bindings.

[18:12] <colomon> okay, just verified via "say" that the error definitely does appear to be happening in the bdSolFree call

[18:13] <colomon> pmichaud: that's all, I just wanted to double-check on that and get the info to you.
