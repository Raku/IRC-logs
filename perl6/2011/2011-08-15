[02:18] <pmichaud> something in the codegen is slowing things down also.

[03:16] <pmichaud> I don't think we use the Complex PMC at all.

[03:56] <pmichaud> masak++

[03:56] <sorear> hello, masak

[03:57] <pmichaud> and were you successful?  Or do you consider 7am to be "early"?  ;-)

[03:57] <sorear> though I can't really agree with your assessment of "early"

[03:59] <masak> well, 6 AM (when my alarm went off) is earlier than 8 AM (when I had originally planned to get up).

[04:00] * masak slides-hacks harder

[04:37] <masak> tadzik: how's it going?

[04:40] <tadzik> masak: very nice. I spent quite a time planning everything I want to say and now I'm struggling with LaTeX to have it the way I want to show it :)

[04:42] <masak> Beamer, eh?

[04:42] <tadzik> yeh

[04:42] <tadzik> it's tricky and I don't know it, but once I learn something, it actually makes sens

[04:42] <masak> (you need to mark it fragile for it to work!) :)

[04:42] <tadzik> no no, it works without it :)

[04:42] <tadzik> But I didn't get to code examples yes

[04:43] <tadzik> s/yes/yet/

[04:43] <masak> right.

[04:43] <masak> remember the fragile :)

[04:44] <tadzik> I know, I know :) I still have my Rakudo Star slides which got stuff right, and I'm stealing snippets from 'em :)

[04:44] <tadzik> ...and they used fragile a lot, iirc

[04:45] <masak> re-use is copy-pasting. :)

[04:45] <masak> don't let yourself be brainwashed by the DRY crowd ;)

[04:47] <tadzik> I'm making a talk. I already did one. So I repeat myself, at least in some sense

[04:48] <masak> that's what I mean. and that's perfectly OK.

[05:24] * Tene did some beamer+graphviz slides recently; worked out pretty well.

[05:24] <pmichaud> tadzik: in the academic publishing world, the winning strategy is to re-use the same material over-and-over again

[05:25] <sorear> What are y'all making slides for?

[05:25] <pmichaud> yapc::eu presentations, in general

[05:26] *** mberends_ joined
[05:26] <pmichaud> masak++ has two presentations today.  jnthn++ has one.  tadzik++ is giving a lightning talk, iiuc.

[05:26] <Tene> I had a huge graph to gradually reveal, so I makred up the source with tagged comments, and had my makefile grep the presentation source for graphname.tags.eps and pass the tags off to a perl script that uncommented the relevant lines according to the tag expressions.

[05:27] <sorear> pmichaud: I'm confused.  I thought you were at the post-YAPC::EU hackathon.  Do you have the ability to send slides back in time?  *looks very attentively*

[05:27] <pmichaud> the hackathon was pre-yapc::eu

[05:27] <Tene> sorear: no, he's just pre-attending the hackathon

[05:28] <pmichaud> today (monday) is the first day of yapc::eu.  the hackathon was on saturday

[05:28] *** _jaldhar left
[05:29] <pmichaud> we often do hackathons post-conference, but since jnthn++ is giving a course on the day after the conference, we put the hackathon pre-conference.  at past yapc::eu's we've typically had a pre-conference hackathon and a post-conference hackathon

[08:54] <Su-Shee> ah. ok.

[08:55] <TimToady> wifi is spotty here, so jnthn++ and pmichaud++ may not be on at the moment

[09:03] <flussence> there!

[09:03] <nine> a new spectest graph?

[09:04] <TimToady> are there 40,000 tests?

[09:05] <flussence> nope, the grey thing is the total number, I just round it up to the next 5000 to stop it looking squashed

[20:28] <supernovus> I'll leave Temporal alone, and see if I can get my own modules to work with nom.

[20:37] <lue> I'm curious. How is it that the internet-related P6 modules actually communicate over the internet?

[20:39] <moritz> by, uhm, using the internet?

[20:40] <moritz> or are you asking about IO::Socket::INET?

[20:40] *** supernovus left
[20:40] <flussence> it has to go through parrot stuff at some point

[20:42] <lue> I was skimming over LWP::Simple, and I couldn't see how it actually sent and received information over the internet.

[21:00] <nano-> flussence: was looking at your perl6 bindings for XMMS2 and became puzzled ;)

[21:00] <flussence> oh, that thing's a mess

[21:01] <nano-> :)

[21:01] <flussence> I was pretty much teaching myself perl6 by doing it

[21:02] <flussence> (and it'd look nicer if more of perl6 itself worked at the time...)

[21:02] <nano-> Yeah, noticed it was just a beginning of something. If you ever decide to finish it, don't hesitate to drop by #xmms2 and we could ship it with the project like we do with the rest of the clientlib bindings. 

[21:02] <flussence> k :D

[21:09] <flussence> I don't think Bufs work in nom just yet, but I've wanted to make a role thing that does auto pack/unpack on classes. Would probably make that code much easier...

[21:11] <bbkr> indeed. whole BSON ( https://github.com/bbkr/BSON ) was a struggle because of undocumented pack/unpack.

[21:13] <bbkr> what exactly is nom branch for?

[21:16] <PerlJam> bbkr: the New Object Model

[21:16] <flussence> rewrite of the internals of rakudo

[21:17] <flussence> it has native types now, which is nice. Just no way to get them as binary...

[22:16] <jnthn> evening, 'perl6

[22:16] <jnthn> er, well, kinda morning, but I don't like to think of it that way :P

[22:16] <pmichaud> jnthn: o/

[22:17] <pmichaud> jnthn: is there an easy way to get to the (parrot) subid for a Regex ?

[22:18] <jnthn> pmichaud: Define "a Regex"

[22:18] <jnthn> (warning: post-pivo ;-))

[22:18] <pmichaud> nom:  say (/abc/).WHAT

[22:18] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT«Regex()␤»

[22:18] <jnthn> pmichaud: Do you have the code object, or a PAST node that references it?

[22:18] <jnthn> Oh, at runtime...

[22:18] <pmichaud> runtime

[22:18] <jnthn> oh

[22:18] <jnthn> nom:  say nqp::getattr(/abc/, Code, '$!do').subid

[22:18] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT«Method 'subid' not found for invocant of class 'Sub'␤  in mu <anon> at /tmp/pxbKp5f5Fb:1␤  in mu <anon> at /tmp/pxbKp5f5Fb:1␤␤»

[22:19] <jnthn> nom:  say nqp::getattr(/abc/, Code, '$!do').get_subid

[22:19] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUT«11_1313446745.40213␤»

[22:19] <jnthn> Like that.

[22:19] <pmichaud> could I put a .get_subid method on the Regex object?

[22:20] <pmichaud> (that then delegates to its $!do)

[22:21] <jnthn> You could, just remember it's user exposed :)

[22:21] <jnthn> That said, I can use it to fix a bug in role comp :P

[22:22] <pmichaud> yeah, the "user exposed" part bugs me a bit.  I can certainly name it something other than "get_subid" if we want.

[22:24] <jnthn> Shove a ! in there. At least they have to quote to get it ;)

[22:25] <pmichaud> alternatively, I could do it with a !nqpattr method.  That might actually be better.

[22:25] <jnthn> What's wrong with nqp::getattr ?

[22:25] <pmichaud> it's not really an attribute in that sense

[22:26] <jnthn> You're getting an attribute and calling a method on it.

[22:26] <jnthn> How much of a hot path is it?

[22:26] <pmichaud> not very hot (more)

[22:26] *** nbrown left
[22:27] <pmichaud> ultimately, given a regex, I have to be able to get its nfa and its list of captures

[22:27] <pmichaud> currently I do this by creating subs in a private namespace that are keyed by the subid of the regex

[22:27] *** im2ee left
[22:27] <pmichaud> this works fine as long as we're in nqp-land, because nqp regexes are bare Parrot subs

[22:28] <jnthn> I'd not rely on it staying that way though :)

[22:28] <pmichaud> but in Rakudo, a .HOW.find_method($cursor, "rule")   is likely to give back a Regex object

[22:28] <jnthn> Yes, it will.

[22:28] <jnthn> Oh, you need a solution generic for NQP and Rakudo? Hm.

[22:28] <jnthn> I now see the temptation of a .get_subid method :)

[22:29] <pmichaud> so, what I do now is I stick a "nqpattr" method on to Parrot Subs

[22:29] <pmichaud> so that I can ask any Parrot sub for its attached nfa or capture list

[22:29] <jnthn> hm

[22:29] <jnthn> I think I'd rather you add a .get_subid to Regex than that ;)

[22:30] *** nbrown joined
[22:30] <jnthn> *or* pick a method name we like and then stick a method call that on the Parrot Sub and the Rakudo Code.

[22:30] <jnthn> s/call/for/

[22:33] <pmichaud> (thinking)

[22:33] <lue> I'm looking at the src/old/core/Buf.pm. Am I right in saying that in Buf[::T = Int], the ::T is what's set in things like uint8 in Array[uint8] (and if not specified, defaults to Int)

[22:34] <pmichaud> jnthn: I'll think on it a bit more for now -- I can work with what I've got for the moment.

[22:34] <jnthn> k

[22:34] <pmichaud> jnthn: but yes, we'll do some sort of method name we like, I suspect

[22:35] <jnthn> pmichaud: I do need it for fixing diamond composition bug in roles.

[22:35] <pmichaud> .get_subid, that is?

[22:35] <lue> s/set in things/set to things/

[22:35] <jnthn> pmichaud: Well, something that lets be distinguish subs that are the same underlying thing.

[22:35] <jnthn> s/be/me/

[22:36] <pmichaud> pick a name, then :)

[22:36] <pmichaud> .SUBWHERE

[22:36] <pmichaud> .SUBWHICH

[22:36] <jnthn> .WHICH ;)

[22:37] <pmichaud> lue: yes, I think so.

[22:37] <pmichaud> jnthn: if we want Code.WHICH to always refer to its underlying Parrot sub, I'm okay with that.

[22:37] <jnthn> afaik, &foo.WHERE === &foo.clone.WHERE should be true

[22:38] <jnthn> (e.g. transparent to closure cloning)

[22:38] <pmichaud> .WHICH works for me for now.

[22:39] *** anbz left
[22:39] <jnthn> +1

[22:39] <jnthn> Can work out the detials later

[22:39] <pmichaud> it's okay if .WHICH returns the subid, as opposed to an address?

[22:40] <jnthn> pmichaud: Well, S02 wants it to return something fairly opaque-ish, iirc.

[22:40] <pmichaud> that's pretty opaque :)

[22:40] <jnthn> It's .WHERE that has to return an address.

[22:41] <jnthn> .WHICH should return an ObjAt

[22:41] <jnthn> But nobody really does it that way yet.

[22:41] <jnthn> afaik

[22:47] <jnthn> OK :)

[22:47] <pmichaud> how was the tour?

[22:47] <jnthn> No hacking...but great fun ;)

[22:47] <jnthn> Well, it was delivered in Esparanto.

[22:47] <diakopter> O_O

[22:48] <pmichaud> seems like a tour during daylight would be slightly better.... not that we have many daylight tour slots remaining, though

[22:48] <jnthn> Which I don't speak at all, but it turns out that you can guess your way through enough to make it worthwhile if you know a little French and Spanish :)

[22:48] <jnthn> (masak speaks it fluently :))

[22:49] <jnthn> Well, it was still pretty light for most of it

[22:49] <jnthn> Yeah, we need to escape from YAPC and wonder around at some point ;)

[22:49] <pmichaud> ah, that works then

[22:49] <pmichaud> maybe wednesday post-conference :)

[22:49] <pmichaud> or thursday post-class

[22:50] <jnthn> aye

[22:50] <jnthn> Anyways, I want to see Damain's keynote, so I'm going to grab some sleep :)

[22:50] <pmichaud> see ya later

[22:50] <jnthn> I'll probably leave around 9:30ish...nothing starts until 10.

[22:51] <jnthn> Happy hacking ;)
