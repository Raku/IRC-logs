[01:26] <lue> for the nom branch, should I use --gen-parrot or --gen-nqp (in the configure)?

[01:34] <pmichaud> you can use both, but --gen-parrot is sufficient

[01:34] <pmichaud> --gen-nqp by itself means it will try to look for a parrot (and fail if it doesn't find one)

[01:34] <pmichaud> I typically do both in my configuration.

[01:35] <lue> I just tried --gen-nqp, but it failed (couldn't find parrot)

[01:36] <lue> So just go --gen-parrot --gen-nqp ?

[02:08] <PerlJam> lue: it's just much smaller for now  :)

[02:08] <pmichaud> it might be less resource-intensive, so far.

[06:53] <thou> masak: maybe i made a mistake, but working with the "nomish" branch there are lots of test failures

[06:53] <thou> OK

[06:54] <thou> masak: i'm interested in getting it running

[06:54] <masak> last thing I did with it was this: http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/november-30-2010-going-out-with-style

[06:54] <masak> thou: oh! that's great news!

[06:54] <masak> thou: I'd recommend starting with getting the tests to run/pass.

[06:54] <masak> oh, you ran them already.

[06:55] <masak> no, it's probably not you making mistakes. it has probably bit-rotted some.

[06:55] * masak checks

[06:55] <masak> thou: have you found the branch "ng-compat" in the november repo?

[06:56] <thou> yeah, makes sense. is current github/viklund the right place?

[06:56] <masak> thou: you should probably be on that one if your Rakudo is newer than a year or so. :)

[06:56] <masak> yes.

[06:56] <thou> masak: ok. i thought i saw more recent commits on "nomish" but i'll switch to ng-compat

[07:54] <thou> (see "[[" on line 36)

[07:54] *** dolmen joined
[07:54] <moritz> because $<chunk> does not flatten

[07:54] <masak> $/<chunk> is an array.

[07:54] <masak> you assign it to another array.

[07:55] <thou> my @x = |$/<chunk>?

[07:55] <moritz> masak: that alone is not enough

[07:55] <masak> no, it isn't.

[07:55] <moritz> thou: try $<chunk>.flat

[07:55] <jnthn> my @x = $<chunk>.list;

[07:55] <masak> or @($<chunk>)

[07:55] <moritz> (but that is really ugly)

[07:55] <masak> I'm not sure if @$<chunk> would work.

[07:56] <moritz> it should, but doesn't in rakudo

[07:56] <moritz> (and yes, long since RTed)

[07:56] <masak> yep :)

[07:57] <masak> someone on FPW had a great idea that I want to try: a script that basically treats the RT queue as a dynamically generated set of tests.

[07:57] <masak> and runs them, and determines if any of the open tickets pass.

[07:57] <thou> hmmm

[07:57] <thou> actually @($/<chunk>) does work

[07:58] <thou> @x = ($/<chunk>, ) # this doesn't work

[07:58] <masak> yes, it does.

[07:58] <moritz> masak: that's not so easy, given that many of them are things like "LTA error message" without saying what the error message should be

[07:58] <masak> thou: no, that still doesn't flatten $<chunk>

[08:02] <moritz> same problem as with Rat literals, I guee

[08:02] <moritz> *guess

[08:03] <masak> thou: you only need to .flat or .list $/<path><chunk>

[08:03] <thou> yeah, but if it's not defined, i think it foobars the whole thing

[08:17] <moritz> jnthn: do you have any idea what to do about Rat and Complex literals?

[08:19] <jnthn> moritz: Literals tend to mean we want to build the objects at compile time.

[08:19] <jnthn> moritz: So we'd want to do something like for integer literals

[08:19] <jnthn> With the added cmplication that they are slightly more complex.

[08:19] <jnthn> er, no pun intended :)

[08:19] <moritz> jnthn: that's what I tried for Rat

[08:20] <masak> mathw: yes, well. the tuits was one thing. but I also notice when a blog post turns out nicely and has a kind of energy about it. I think the ones in the beginning had more of that.

[08:20] <moritz> jnthn: and afaict the Rat got constructed fine, but the serializer can't handle it

[08:20] <mathw> masak: the ones at the start seemed to have a very great purpose and direction about them. That's not quite so present at the moment

[08:20] <tadzik> mberends: o hey

[08:21] <tadzik> mberends: some zavolaj tests are broken, aren't they?

[08:21] <jnthn> moritz: Or, I do for Rat and then maybe you try it for complex :)

[08:21] <masak> mathw: right, exactly.

[08:21] <masak> mathw: mostly because they don't :)

[08:21] <moritz> jnthn: deal :-)

[08:22] <tadzik> moritz: would you mind if I swapped my gsoc goals for the two upcoming weeks? $=POD seems like a lot more important thing to do, also it's harder for me to estimate the time amount needed for that

[10:59] *** _twitch joined
[10:59] <moritz> well yes, I'm repeating all the old bugs :-)

[11:00] <colomon> btw, in my opinion 2 * .5 should not be an Int

[11:00] <moritz> that was never the question

[11:00] <moritz> the question was about +(2 * 0.5)

[11:01] <moritz> because the + does numeric type magic on Str too

[11:02] <colomon> you mean +"(2 * 0.5)"   ?

[11:02] <moritz> no

[11:02] <moritz> I mean +(2 * 0.5)

[11:03] <colomon> woah.  that strikes me as unthinkably bad, actually.

[11:03] <moritz> why?

[11:03] <moritz> prefix:<+> means 'give me a number'

[11:03] <moritz> and an Int certainly is a number

[11:04] <colomon> because it's asking .Numeric to change the Numeric type of its input

[11:04] <moritz> well, .Numeric is free to return anything that is ~~ Numeric

[11:05] <colomon> sure, but you're asking a no-op to become an op

[11:05] <moritz> yes

[11:05] <moritz> it's not a no-op by spec right now, afaict

[11:06] <moritz> is there anything you can't do on an Int that you can do on a Rat?

[11:06] <moritz> or asked differently, where would that hurt?

[11:06] <moritz> (mind you, I'm not all sold on the idea, I'd just like to understand why you object)

[11:08] <colomon> I can't think of any sort of generic math result issues it would cause.  Though obviously you cannot call Rat-specific operations on an Int.

[11:09] <colomon> but it is an efficiency issue, and a consistency issue.

[11:09] <colomon> how far would you take that logic?

[11:09] <colomon> should +(4.Num) be an Int?

[11:09] <colomon> or +(4 + 0i)?

[11:12] <colomon> afk # have to get in gear if I'm going to make it to the airport on time

[11:12] <moritz> I'd be happy to experiment with how far to take the idea

[11:14] <colomon> though one last thought: you're effectively saying that "1" + (2 * 1/2) should be an Int, but 1 + (2 * 1/2) should be a Rat....

[11:15] <moritz> no

[11:16] <moritz> I'm talking about prefix:<+>

[11:16] <moritz> not infix:<+>

[11:16] <moritz> unless infix calls prefix... hm...

[11:16] <moritz> that would be bad indeed

[11:18] *** masak joined
[11:19] <masak> <moritz> opinion question: should the + in +(2 * 0.5) convert the result to Int?

[11:19] <masak> emphatic YES. :)

[11:21] *** JimmyZ joined
[11:23] <colomon> infix:<+> calls prefix:<+> if both arguments are not numeric

[11:23] <colomon> calls it on both sides, that it

[11:23] <colomon> *is

[11:24] <masak> the use case for prefix:<+> numifying to the narrowest possible type is that things like 'my Int $x = +$0' will Just Work.

[11:25] <colomon> sure, but why should it just work, if $0 is not an Int (or other object that becomes an Int)?

[11:26] <colomon> should +"2/2" be an Int?

[11:27] *** lichtkind joined
[11:27] <masak> +<2/2> could be a Rat or an Int. I don't know if the same rules apply to +"2/2" -- guessing not.

[11:28] <masak> I'd expect +"2/2" to be 2 and an Int.

[11:29] <masak> colomon: and I do see your concerns about Rats becoming Ints all of a sudden.

[11:29] <masak> I agree we should probably be careful there, and (say) make sure that operations on Rats always yield Rats when the user expects it.

[11:30] *** mtk joined
[11:31] <colomon> or to put it another way: you're saying that my Rat $x = +$y *shouldn't* work if $y happens to be a Rat with a denominator of 1.

[11:32] <moritz> why would you use a + there?

[11:33] <moritz> if you're not sure what type $y is, you should use my Rat $x = $y.Rat anyway

[11:33] <masak> right. but there are cases where I'm sure the Str contains the representation of an Int.

[11:33] <moritz> maybe the operation of narrowing a numeric type down should be separate from prefix +, but still available

[11:33] <moritz> masak: we're not discussion Str -> Numeric conversion

[11:34] <lichtkind> that will just default to $*IN? ($answer = get;)

[11:34] <moritz> masak: that's already specced as giving you an Int in this case

[11:34] <moritz> (it's just rakudo that lags behind)

[11:34] <masak> moritz: ah, so $y would already be a number? no, I don't want that.

[11:34] <colomon> I'm certainly all in favor of having a way of narrowing a numeric type.  I just am not at all comfortable with that being prefix:<+>

[11:34] <masak> moritz: that should be a no-op IMHO.

[11:35] <masak> moritz: just like prefix:<~> is a no-op on Strs and prefix:<?> is a no-op on Bools.

[11:35] <moritz> 13:19 < masak> <moritz> opinion question: should the + in +(2 * 0.5) convert  the result to Int?

[11:35] <moritz> 13:19 < masak> emphatic YES. :)

[11:35] <masak> let me retract that :)

[11:35] <moritz> now I'm surprised by the disconnect... Ok

[11:35] <masak> emphatic NO :P

[12:32] <masak> people: would y'all agree that the Structured Programming movement was primarily about the maintainability of programs?

[12:32] <colomon> hmmm....

[12:32] <colomon> not exactly, I'd say.

[12:33] <flussence> I'd say it was more about the maintainability of programmers :)

[12:33] <masak> please elaborate if possible, both of you.

[12:36] <masak> Structured Programming, at its simplest, favored if/elsif/else and given-like constructs, as well as while/repeat/do-while loops, to goto statements.

[12:36] <masak> Java takes this to an extreme by having labels and even a goto keyword, but no goto semantics. :)

[12:37] <tadzik> a rainy day

[12:37] *** Holy_Cow1 joined
[12:38] <masak> my point is, how is this re-focusing on "higher-order" program-flow constructs not about maintainability?

[12:38] <masak> colomon, flussence: I'm curious since both of you seem to feel it missed the point.

[12:38] <colomon> it's not that it missed the point

[12:39] <colomon> it's just that it makes the point a little too strongly

[12:39] <colomon> IMO

[12:39] <lichtkind> masak: oh no i just looked after the highlighted messages after coming back from a hack and didnt seen yours sorry

[12:39] <colomon> except to the extent that all improvements to programming are improvements to maintainability.  ;)

[12:40] <masak> lichtkind: no idea what you're talking about.

[12:40] <masak> colomon: ok, that's a fair point.

[12:40] <colomon> I'd say it was sort of half maintainability and half... ummm.... write-ability.

[12:40] <flussence> and improvements to amintainability = reduced burnout :)

[12:41] <colomon> having actually programmed in the bad old days of goto, let me tell you, having functions with local variables makes code a LOT easier to write.

[12:42] <colomon> and easier to maintain is then the flip side of that

[12:42] <masak> one thing that Structured Programming does, according to Wikipedia, is to say "everything you could do with goto you can also do (nicer) with conditionals and loops". with the additional benefit that it's easier to reason about for both humans and computers alike.

[12:42] <lichtkind> masak: i didnt seen your first answer "masak	get is enough." because of the other hihlighted that were already there

[12:42] <tadzik> nom: my $=POD

[12:42] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Could not find sub &PODâ¤current instr.: '_block1002' pc 73 ((file unknown):135) (:1)â¤Â»

[12:42] <tadzik> ...what?

[12:42] <tadzik> ach, $ = POD()

[12:43] * lichtkind doubts that everything you can do with goto could done with loops

[12:43] <flussence> functions and everything based on them are just fancy gotos anyway :)

[12:43] <flussence> (take that, haskell! :)

[12:44] <lichtkind> haha

[12:44] <moritz> lichtkind: never heard of Turing completeness?

[12:44] <lichtkind> moritz: i had cases where i deliberatly choose goto because anything else just went ugly

[12:44] <masak> lichtkind: ugly != impossible

[12:45] <lichtkind> yes of course

[12:45] <colomon> well, impossible-ish.

[12:45] <masak> I love to 'return' out of loops. some people hate that.

[12:45] <colomon> there are stunts you could do with goto that you cannot do without it.

[12:45] <masak> especially the "single point of exit" people.

[12:46] <colomon> you can write a program to do the same thing without goto, but it will be more obtuse or less efficient

[12:46] <moritz> masak: I never really understood their point of view

[12:46] * colomon thinks single point of exit people are completely bonkers

[12:46] <masak> colomon: oh sure. Duff's device, for example.

[12:46] <moritz> I know that Bertrand Meyer argues it makes code easier to understand

[12:46] <moritz> (or at least he did in OOSC v2)

[12:47] <masak> moritz: I think it's a rare form of programmer's "grammar nazism".

[12:47] *** daniel-s left
[12:47] <moritz> but... he neglected to take into account that it can make the routine bodies themselves far more complicated

[12:47] <tadzik> nqp seems to not like <?{ }> in grammars

[12:47] <[Coke]> return early, return oftne.

[12:47] <masak> moritz: I'm content with knowing that any multiple-exit routine can be mechanically transformed into a single-exit one.

[12:47] <masak> [Coke]: amen to that.

[12:47] <colomon> the classic example of an efficient goto trick is goto a sub instead of calling it, so that you save a stack shift / return statement.  doesn't really work in structured languages, but it's a nice trick in old BASIC or assembly.

[12:48] <lichtkind> i had to deinstall my old rakudo but now make process is moving :)

[12:50] <flussence> perl5 also has the &subname syntax thing, IIRC

[12:50] <masak> flussence: yes, but with a different meaning than in Perl 6.

[12:50] <flussence> yeah, I'm referring to the goto-sub-stack-shift thing

[12:51] <masak> flussence: in Perl 4, you called a sub foo by writing 'do foo'. then it became '&foo', and only then 'foo'.

[12:52] <masak> flussence: the '&foo' form still exists, and also has two "extra" behaviors: it doesn't check prototypes and it doesn't set @_.

[12:52] <masak> or in a word, "yeech".

[12:52] <flussence> that last bit was what I was getting at, it lets you cheat. Not in a good way though :)

[12:52] <masak> it's still no tailcall, AFAIK.

[12:53] <masak> I might be wrong, though.

[13:10] <tadzik> survey: would you prefer Pod-related classes in Perl6 to be named Pod:: or Pod6::?

[13:10] <tadzik> I'm more into the former as I think of it now

[13:11] <moritz> the 6 is already implied in the 'use v6;'

[13:11] <tadzik> that's what I wanted to hear, thanks

[13:12] *** bluescreen10 joined
[13:14] <masak> what moritz said.

[13:14] <masak> S26 calls it Pod, too.

[13:14] <masak> the 6 only makes sense from a Perl 5 perspective, really.

[13:15] <tadzik> troo

[13:17] <masak> moritz: I guess single exit-points are more important in a medium with manual memory management.

[13:18] <masak> even so, one could imagine such a language having the equivalent of a LEAVE {} construct.

[13:31] <masak> it is factually true that the presence or absence of that section has little impact on any current applications, simply because none of them produce "perl" executables.

[13:39] <frettled> masak: but this reminds me that an anagram generator in Perl 6 would probably be cool.

[13:39] <masak> frettled: Jag Vann Dit Sold

[13:40] <masak> frettled: I challenge you to write an anagram generator. and make the code really transparent and pretty. :)

[13:40] *** _twitch left
[13:40] <masak> not *literally* transparent, of course. that's Whitespace. but easy-to-read.

[13:41] <frettled> masak: dang

[13:41] <arnsholt> I think a trie is a good place to start for an anagram generator

[13:41] *** mtk left
[13:42] <arnsholt> And some kind of recursive enumeration of all possible anagrams

[13:42] *** mtk joined
[13:42] <moritz> I think you shouldn't generate anagrams, but search them

[13:43] <arnsholt> Well, yeah. But I think recursively enumerating all possible permutations is a good place to start, and then using the dictionary trie to filter what you generate

[13:43] <frettled> Anagrams are cooler if you require that they at least _seem_ like proper words.  Some password generators are like that, those are very nice.

[13:44] <frettled> Setec Astronomy => too many secrets (STR, but are there other nice anagrams for that?)

[13:44] <arnsholt> Well, if your filter is populated with /usr/share/dict/words, it would contain only known words

[13:45] <masak> as far as I can tell, you could solve this by using Dancing Links.

[13:46] <masak> arnsholt, frettled: any of you coming to YAPC::EU?

[13:46] <arnsholt> I'd really like to, but no =/

[13:46] *** MayDaniel joined
[13:46] <masak> oh well.

[13:47] <masak> I'll make sure to put up the slides afterwards, though. then we can at least talk about it over IRC.

[13:47] <arnsholt> But "recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm" sounds more or less like what I was thinking of

[13:47] <frettled> masak: me neither :(

[13:47] <frettled> no holidays left

[13:49] <masak> arnsholt: I'm writing an ASCII-art frontend to Dancing Links in Moose right now.

[13:49] <arnsholt> Nifty!

[13:49] <tadzik> moritz: oh, I left one "Pod6::" in there

[13:49] <moritz> tadzik: that might explain things

[13:49] <tadzik> yeah

[13:50] <masak> arnsholt: https://github.com/masak/dlx-simple/blob/master/doc/design/01-overview.md

[13:52] <arnsholt> Interesting!

[13:52] <arnsholt> How much magic are you going to put into the Reader/Writer parts?

[13:52] <arnsholt> Or rather, will there be magic, or are they things you'll have to roll on your own?

[13:53] <frettled> masak: fascinating!

[13:53] <masak> :)

[13:53] <masak> arnsholt: not sure I understand the question.

[13:53] <masak> arnsholt: define "magic".

[13:54] <arnsholt> Heh. Magic might be a bit hyperbolic, I admit

[13:54] <arnsholt> To what extent will your code be able to figure out the ASCII->Matrix and Matrix->ASCII mappings on its own?

[13:55] <arnsholt> Or will those be things a user will code up on their own?

[13:55] <masak> arnsholt: I expect to have to write pretty dedicated parsers for each type of problem.

[13:56] <lichtkind> sorry my question maybe gets really stupif but i gut in my shell a green thing called perl6 wich i cant call but has +rwx its not a softlink

[13:56] <masak> arnsholt: the thing that will probably be generalizable/reusable is the mapping code itself.

[13:56] <lichtkind> it has a * behind it in ls -l

[13:56] <arnsholt> masak: Yeah, that's where my initial 30 seconds of pondering ended up as well =)

[13:56] *** drbean_ left
[13:56] <tadzik> nom gets confused if I put Foo::Bar classes into the setting. FooBar are ok, but for Foo::Bar ./perl6 says "Could not find symbol 'Foo::&Bar'"

[13:56] <arnsholt> But people 'round here have a tendency to come up with surprising amounts of cleverness =)

[13:57] <arnsholt> BTW, it might be worthwhile to have the Perl5 code call out to the C code, once you get that far

[13:57] <arnsholt> I've hacked with some SWIG stuff lately, and it's quite nice to work with

[13:59] <masak> nice idea. might gain me some speed.

[13:59] <masak> thanks.

[13:59] <arnsholt> You're welcome. Feel free to prod me about it

[13:59] <arnsholt> The docs are a bit obtuse unfortunately, but it turns out to be reasonable in the end

[14:00] <masak> arnsholt: the parsing will essentially be of 2d ASCII art, so I doubt there'll be much commonality, except in limited cases.

[14:12] <TimToady> I guess it's statement modifiers that are more of a problem

[14:13] <moritz> I wanted to use nom, but I failed

[14:14] <pmichaud> I'm still a little uncertain about semicolons in parens, though.

[14:17] <TimToady> you could think of it as a funny list infix in that case

[14:18] <TimToady> it's no more retroactive than X or Z

[14:18] <pmichaud> so, even though we parse them as  '(' <statementlist> ')', it really acts like a semiarglist inside?  i.e., each of the ';' components are kept?

[14:19] <pmichaud> my @foo = ( stmt; stmt; bar() );    # the stmts aren't in sink context

[14:20] <TimToady> that's the point of not parsing with statementlist

[14:20] <TimToady> that's why we have semiarglist, to change the semantics of ;

[14:21] <pmichaud> I'm just saying that circumfix:<( )>  doesn't use semiarglist, but has to act like it.  Is that correct?

[14:50] <moritz> speaking of dumpers... in nom, --target=parse is pretty useless atm

[14:50] <pmichaud> yes, I think we're going to have to re-implement Data::Dumper for nqp

[14:51] <pmichaud> Parrot's Data::Dumper doesn't know how to deal with 6model objects, or something like that.

[14:51] <pmichaud> or perhaps it's as simple as creating 'dump' methods on the 6model versions of Capture/Match... but I'm not entirely sure about that

[14:52] <[Coke]> might just need a plugin.

[14:52] <pmichaud> I bet Data::Dumper will also have trouble with object attributes from 6model

[14:52] <[Coke]> You should be able to write your own method for dumping, IIRC.

[14:52] <pmichaud> yes, it's just 'dump' :-)

[14:53] <pmichaud> er, '__dump'

[14:53] <pmichaud> looks like __dump is defined in src/Regex/Dumper.pir (of nqp), but I'm not sure it's working.

[14:54] *** koban left
[14:54] <pmichaud> almost certain not to work -- it doesn't appear to have been 6modelified

[14:55] <pmichaud> well... hrm.

[14:55] <pmichaud> maybe it has been done.  anyway, when it works in nqp, it'll likely start to work in nom.

[15:03] <moritz> I'm trying to patch Complex to hold two (native) num objects

[15:27] <TimToady> I'm wondering if there should be a Default role that the standard containers use, with a default default of Any

[15:27] <TimToady> rather than, say, passing special arguments to KeyHash

[15:28] <pmichaud> I could see that working.  Maybe de-huffmanize Default a little (seems too generic a word to me)

[15:28] <TimToady> well, in practice, we might have special syntax for a declarator

[15:28] <TimToady> my $x ! 42  or some such

[15:28] <TimToady> suggestions welcome

[15:28] <moritz> what would that do?

[15:28] <TimToady> set $x to 42 if you say $x = Nil

[15:29] <TimToady> or rather, assume it's 42

[15:29] <TimToady> my @x ! 42 would return 42 for any non-existing element

[15:29] <pmichaud> maybe de-huffmanize ! a little, too :)

[15:30] <moritz> what about a trait?

[15:40] <jnthn> :P

[15:41] <TimToady> it bothers me ever so slightly that it means something a bit different for my @x is nil(42) than my $x is nil(42)

[15:41] <jnthn> TimToady: Only to the degree that my int $x and my int @x are different though, I guess

[15:41] <TimToady> or more to the point, my %x is nil(42)

[15:41] <pmichaud> feels like we want a counterpart to 'of'

[15:42] <moritz> 'fo'

[15:42] <TimToady> since the element exists in $x, and generally doesn't in %x

[15:42] <moritz> sorry, could not resists

[15:53] <jnthn> It's not breaking encapsulation. It's *trusting*. :D

[15:53] <TimToady> btw, I do agree that Complex should not be assumed to be identical to complex

[15:54] <TimToady> it might default to Complex[num,num], but Complex[Rat,Rat] is also likely

[15:58] <jnthn> create doesn't need a type object. 

[15:58] <jnthn> Any instance will do.

[15:58] <pmichaud> ...it's still a lookup :)

[15:59] <moritz> if I do nqp::create($a), and somebody subclasses Complex...

[15:59] <jnthn> pmichaud: static multi-dispatch optimization + inliner + lexical to register lowerer = fine :P

[15:59] <pmichaud> jnthn: agreed, it'll work out. 

[15:59] <moritz> does it automatically generate an instance of the subtype?

[15:59] <jnthn> moritz: ...then it'll probably do the right thing :)

[15:59] <jnthn> moritz: Yes :)

[16:00] <pmichaud> I'm pretty sure repr_instance_of  does an implicit .WHAT

[16:00] <jnthn> pmichaud: I sure hpo not.

[16:00] <pmichaud> (and thus nqp::create does so also)

[16:00] <jnthn> pmichaud: It's a wasted .WHAT if so.

[16:00] <pmichaud> oh, guess not.

[16:01] * jnthn designed it to be agnostic about that on purpose :)

[16:01] <pmichaud> then how does  nqp::create($a) work?

[16:01] <pmichaud> (if $a isn't a type object)

[16:02] <moritz> STable magic?

[16:03] <jnthn> pmichaud: It simply doesn't matter to create whether it's passed an instance or a type object.

[16:03] *** bakedb joined
[16:03] <jnthn> pmichaud: If it has any repr data, that's on the s-table

[16:03] <pmichaud> jnthn: right.  An "implicit WHAT".  Note the word "implicit"

[16:04] <pmichaud> create says "create an instance of the same type as what I'm passing you"

[16:52] <TimToady> that's for "thirsty", not hungry

[16:54] <PerlJam> I don't think it's for "thirsty" as much as for something else that just happens to involve liquids

[16:55] * TimToady looks around for a fifth of milk...

[16:55] <Su-Shee> I had my fifth coffee an hour ago.. ;)

[16:55] <Su-Shee> good evening everyone.

[16:55] <PerlJam> <@Nicholas> Perl 6 has complex numbers built in. Does that mean that it can have imaginary versions?

[16:55] <PerlJam> <@Nicholas> That solves the whole 5 vs 6 thing - Perl 5 gets the real axis, Perl 6 the imaginary.

[16:56] <PerlJam> (from #p5p)

[16:56] <PerlJam> Now *there's* an idea!  :)

[16:56] <TimToady> those guys have no imagination...

[16:57] <Su-Shee> well I'm choosing both. always. perl 5 and 6, facebook and google plus.. sugar and milk...

[16:57] <moritz> and non-standard implementations get angles other than 0 and pi/2

[16:57] <thou> sounds like it would be complex to implement

[16:58] <pmichaud> alas, a lot of people believe Perl 6 is imaginary already.

[16:58] <TimToady> it's not like 5 and 6 are polar opposites...

[16:59] <Su-Shee> "imagine a released version of perl 6 and here, magically you can download it on github" ;)

[17:01] <pmichaud> did you see my note above about decontainerizing?

[17:01] <pmichaud> you might need to decontainerize $a if the Complex is coming in with a scalar container

[17:01] <moritz> and I shoudl bind to $a

[17:01] <moritz> erm, $new

[17:02] <pmichaud> that's often better, yes :)

[17:11] <TimToady> the question is whether I ever don't have that urge...

[17:11] <masak> heh

[17:12] <TimToady> but I have to stay neutral if Perl 6 is ever to become the Swiss Banking System of programming

[17:14] <kthakore> about anything ... even the bankers defineatley aren't

[17:15] <beekor> was/is pugs a viable start?  i could never tell if interest faded and it fell behind, or if it suffered from bigger issues.

[17:15] <Su-Shee> kthakore: do I have to remember you what happened when someone who hasn't a clue about GUI like torvalds said he prefers KDE? suddenly everybody started quoting and taking it as an order to choose "the right desktop"...

[17:16] <Su-Shee> beekor: for what a start? to write perl6 code? I would use rakudo.

[17:16] <beekor> oh yeah i know.  but i was thinking of the haskell

[17:16] <TimToady> beekor: sure, it was the viablest start at the time

[17:16] <Su-Shee> beekor: then pugs it is.

[17:17] <kthakore> Su-Shee: oh ppl .. do listen. Good point.

[17:17] <beekor> i've tried p6 for a few hours here and there with rakudo.

[17:17] <TimToady> but audreyt++ suffered from health issues, and nobody else wanted to get a big enough brain transplant to continue it

[17:17] <beekor> i'm slowly drifting towards it.

[17:17] * kthakore is glad he hasn't made anything important so people take him seriously

[17:17] <beekor> gotcha.

[17:17] <kthakore> What needs to happen in pugs anyway?

[17:18] <TimToady> well, at the time it was stalled out on a MOP, mostly

[17:18] <TimToady> which we now have

[17:23] <masak> TimToady: oh, you'll like Mandarin. I look forward to seeing the postfix:<äº†> operator in Perl 6 :P

[17:23] <kthakore> I am taking 3ish weeks off for July so I released a quick SDL module that Util and I discussed

[17:23] <TimToady> xhacktly: see masak ^^

[17:23] <kthakore> Su-Shee: it doesn't do much as of yet

[17:23] <Su-Shee> kthakore: I was meaning to say that you're experienced in hacking down modules anyways so it's actually a good idea to start porting etc

[17:29] <masak> xhacktly: it's good if you want to talk about program behaviour on the channel.

[17:30] <masak> I love reducing things to the concrete. so many things we like and care about follow that principle: tests, bug reports, p6eval one-liners...

[17:31] <xhacktly> hm ok nice ;) yes i just dropped by (i understand this channel is more for developing perl6 then newbiz that may needs help..?)  

[17:33] <TimToady> we feed on newbiz here...wait, that didn't come out right...

[17:33] <masak> no, it's for newbiz too.

[17:34] <TimToady> because there's a sense in which we're all still newbiz when it comes to Perl 6

[17:34] <masak> xhacktly: basically, every time someone comes in from the outside saying "hi, I'm new here" like you just did, we get giddy with joy and expectation :)

[17:51] <tadzik> ah, damnit. Who puts a taxi number on a pizza flyer

[18:00] <kthakore> gratis = thankyou?

[18:00] <Su-Shee> no.

[18:01] <kthakore> ok

[18:01] <huf> btw i have no idea what owocowa means, it was on the box of some tea

[18:01] <huf> fruit, that makes sense

[18:01] <Su-Shee> gratis -> "without having to pay money for it" usally "on top of this, you'll get x for free"

[18:01] <huf> that's what it means in english too

[18:01] <huf> among other languages

[18:02] <Su-Shee> rabat is rabatt in german and I think we both took it from italian

[18:02] <Su-Shee> oh, and "git!" is a polish word too, says my coworker. :)

[18:05] <masak> Su-Shee: that definition of "gratis" is forbidden in Sweden by Swedish laws of commerce. I'm shocked by the usage every time I go to Poland :)

[18:06] <masak> Su-Shee: (in Sweden, you're only allowed to use it in the sense "absolutely no strings attached". which means marketing weasels are gliding over to using the English loan "fri" instead.)

[18:09] <tadzik> Su-Shee: everyone when someone says "git!" I say "svn!"

[18:09] <Su-Shee> tadzik: haha :)

[18:10] <Su-Shee> masak: hm, actually that sounds very much like we might have something like this too :)

[18:10] <tadzik> svn? Poor you

[18:29] <pmichaud> in the meantime, perhaps keep it as a separate module from the setting.

[18:29] <pmichaud> that might actually be extra helpful, since we don't have a lot of modules to test at the moment in nom.

[18:42] <moritz> so I've added decontainerize where necessary... and now it's P6opaque attributes NYFI 6 (used to be 2)

[18:49] <thundergnat> Hi perl6, good *

[18:50] <thundergnat> I added a Perl 6 solution for Rosettacode task Natural Sorting. http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Natural_sorting#Perl_6

[18:50] <thundergnat> The latin1-decompose routine is not very elegant though. My DRY sense is greatly bothered by having to repeat the hash keys in the .subst method.

[18:51] <thundergnat> Everything else I tried ran into NYI issues in Rakudo though.

[18:51] <thundergnat> Anyone have any commentary/suggestion on how to better implement that?

[18:51] <moritz> eval always works :/

[18:52] <moritz> and then use <$re>

[18:52] <thundergnat> That looks a little less ugly.

[18:54] <tadzik> maybe ||?

[18:54] *** bbkr_ joined
[18:56] <thundergnat> pmichaud: I kept wanting to write /( | %tr.keys) / but that doesn't work (and probably isn't spec)

[18:56] <pmichaud> maybe .trans is more what you're looking for there?

[18:56] <pmichaud> instead of .subst ?

[18:57] <thundergnat> Does trans do 1 => 2 letter translations? Ã† => AE

[18:57] <pmichaud> yes, I believe it does.

[18:57] <thundergnat> I'm more used to perl 5 where it doesn't.

[19:00] <masak> maybe it needs a better local maximum :)

[19:00] <pmichaud> it may be to spec, but the implementation is ugly and needs improvement, imo

[19:00] <masak> pmichaud: awww, are you sure? :/

[19:00] <masak> pmichaud: I rewrote the whole thing last November...

[19:01] <pmichaud> masak: when I look at it again for nom, I'll have a better answer then :)

[19:01] <masak> pmichaud: it became faster, more spec-aligned, and higher quality.

[19:01] <masak> maybe it needs *some* tweaks, but it's certainly an improvement on what was there before...

[19:01] <pmichaud> masak: all of these points are undoubtedly true.  that doesn't mean it can't use further improvement

[19:01] <masak> right.

[19:02] <pmichaud> I'm not saying what you did in November was a step backwards.  I'm saying I see more steps forward.

[19:03] <pmichaud> and when I tried to create some speed improvements in master, it was always .trans (and only .trans) that broke.

[19:04] <masak> pmichaud: oh, interesting.

[19:04] <thundergnat> \o/

[19:04] <pmichaud> so I had to give up on the speed improvements.

[19:04] <masak> pmichaud: that might be a statement about those improvements as much as about .trans, though.

[19:05] <masak> .trans is fairly complex and exercises a lot of parts.

[19:05] <pmichaud> masak: well, everything else worked, and I couldn't figure out why it was failing in .trans.

[19:05] <masak> pmichaud: I'm sorry you couldn't understand that code. I'm looking at it now and it looks very clean and matter-of-fact to me.

[19:05] <masak> pmichaud: looking forward to your improvements.

[19:06] <masak> I remember .trans being a biggish problem to tackle. it all didn't click until I realized I could factor out a lot of the details into the LSM class.

[19:06] <pmichaud> I'm not saying it's trivial, definitely. 

[19:07] <tadzik> how do I solve the thing I did above?

[19:07] <tadzik> I have a feeling I'm missing something trivial

[19:15] <pmichaud> I'm still a bit proud of the new iterators implementation :)

[19:15] <tadzik> I want to make the above paste both working, and sensemaking

[19:16] <masak> tadzik: if you want to set an attribute from a parent class, the parent class needs to have a setter.

[19:16] <masak> tadzik: the easiest way to give it one is to do '$.attr is rw'.

[19:16] <pmichaud> Pod__Block__Code shouldn't be setting @!content in its BUILD -- that's the job of Pod__Block's BUILD

[19:16] *** Trashlord left
[19:16] <tadzik> pmichaud: yes, but callsame; is NYI

[19:16] <tadzik> hence my problems

[19:16] <masak> BUILD shouldn't need callsame.

[19:17] <pmichaud> ...and you wouldn't be using callsame to do it.

[19:17] <tadzik> hmm

[19:17] <masak> BUILDALL calls all the BUILDs. hence the name.

[19:22] <pmichaud> I really wish I could get rid of that method entirely from Parrot.

[19:22] <pmichaud> (it's not an issue at all in nom, however :)

[19:22] <thundergnat> Ok, I never would have figured THAT one out... :\

[19:23] <pmichaud> yeah, that's part of what makes it so infuriating.  it's almost impossible to detect or trap for

[19:25] <pmichaud> tadzik: I'm still thinking about build.

[19:25] <pmichaud> the easiest short-term ("today") solution I can think of us is to give each BUILD method a slightly different name, to avoid inheritance issues.

[19:25] <tadzik> well, that's the last thing I want to do, TBH :)

[19:26] <pmichaud> why is that?  that seems like less of a workaround than anything else I can come up with.

[19:26] <tadzik> probably, yes

[19:27] <pmichaud> I think we could probably make a temporary BUILDALL that automatically calls all of the BUILD methods

[19:27] <pmichaud> depends on how well ^methods is implemented, I guess.

[19:27] <pmichaud> nom:  say 3.^methods().perl

[19:27] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Array.new(Bool, Int, Num, abs, Bridge, chr, succ, pred, Str, Numeric, ACCEPTS, bytes, chars, fmt, substr, uc, lc, ucfirst, lcfirst, chomp, chop, ord, flip, index, rindex, eager, elems, infinite, flat, hash, list, reverse, Array, grep, join, map, min, postcircumfix:<[ ]>, at_â€¦

[19:27] <pmichaud> nom:  say 3.^methods(:local).perl

[19:27] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Array.new(Bool, Int, Num, abs, Bridge, chr, succ, pred, Str)â¤Â»

[19:27] <pmichaud> that has some potential

[19:28] <pmichaud> (since I think submethods are NYI in nom)

[19:29] <tadzik> that whole range of problems is probably nothing compared to what I'll have to do working around the lack of SymbolTable in master

[20:30] <dalek> rakudo/nom: This patch replaces one line of code with 10, but it should avoid any box and unbox operation.

[20:30] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Doing the same with operators will be rather straight-forward, but quite repetitive.

[20:30] <dalek> rakudo/nom: I wonder if it could be automated. I have read about tools called "compilers" that could

[21:09] <wolfman2000> Afternoon. I know, I know, have to idle in here more often

[21:09] <masak> thou: or "got".

[21:10] <masak> wolfman2000: no, you have to be active in here more often :P

[21:10] <wolfman2000> that too

[21:10] <wolfman2000> plenty of things have been crazy

[21:10] <lichtkind> masak: i mean got

[21:10] <masak> wolfman2000: all(@things) === $crazy

[21:10] <wolfman2000> also true

[21:11] <masak> the absurdist-junctional interpretation.

[21:12] <thou> so, i have a grammars question. of historical context. i'm looking at a grammar that used to return undefined for $<path><chunk>, and now that same thing is returning the empty array. Code that uses the grammar is often doing things like: something_with($<path><chunk> // ''). I know i could switch // to || and it works OK, but i'd like to understand why the grammar is behaving differently.

[21:12] <thou> https://github.com/viklund/november/blob/ng-compat/lib/November/URI/Grammar.pm

[21:13] <thou> token path       { <slash>? [ <chunk> '/'?]* }; # * mb wrong, because that allow '' URI

[21:14] <moritz> that part of the spec has changed back and forth a few times

[21:14] <thou> do you happen to know what that part of the spec is, so i can read up on it?

[21:14] <moritz> oh wait no, I'm confusing that with something else

[21:14] <masak> no, I think you're close.

[21:14] <masak> it's definitely to do with quantifiers, if I see correctly.

[21:14] <thou> i like having it be undef, it seems cleaner in the rest of the code

[21:14] <moritz> what I thought about <foo>?  producing an array or not

[21:15] <masak> right.

[21:15] <masak> thou: undef doesn't exist any more.

[21:15] <thou> well, Any or whatever

[21:15] <masak> thou: well, those two are different :P

[21:15] <thou> i shouldn't be sloppy

[21:15] <wolfman2000> well masak, what has taken place the last...4 months?

[21:19] <xhacktly> masak i am currently reading; modern perl but i read about things on the internet that says that perl6 is very very different from perl5 is it?

[21:20] <masak> thou: that looks about right.

[21:21] <sjn> xhacktly: btw, welcome to #perl6 :)

[21:21] <xhacktly> thx salve;)

[21:21] <thou> so <foo> ?  will return Nil (which is undefined, yay); but <foo> * will return () (which is defined, but false)

[21:22] <sjn> xhacktly: have you had any opportunity to look at masak's Perl6 intro blogs?

[21:22] <masak> xhacktly: it's significantly different, yes. some people say "new language".

[21:22] * masak is edublogging right now :)

[21:25] <xhacktly> sjn:  yes have read some of the blog post, but feel like i kinda need to know perl5 to really understand it..

[21:25] <clintongormley> baaaah :)

[21:25] <wolfman2000> ...ah. so nom and Niecza are new compilers?

[21:25] <masak> heh, people seem to hope for Perl 6 on .NET. there's already Niecza :)

[21:25] <masak> wolfman2000: nom is Rakudo with a new foundation.

[21:25] <clintongormley> no, i read about niecza (assume it was that) running on .net, and running much faster than rakudo

[21:25] <masak> wolfman2000: Niecza is a little over a year old now.

[21:25] <sjn> xhacktly: I suggest you tell masak about all the spots where he's assuming you know something :=

[21:25] <wolfman2000> ......man, I'm already behind

[22:00] <dalek> rakudo/nom: fix stupid thinko in Complex math

[22:00] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/22676c514e

[22:04] <moritz> ok, nom can now run mandelbrot-color.pl

[22:04] <moritz> ... and do a 101x101 in 46s

[22:04] * moritz should dig up old numbers from master

[22:07] <moritz> http://lastofthecarelessmen.blogspot.com/2009/06/mandelbrot-in-perl-6.html talks about 80x80 in 3 minutes 20s, but that's quite a different code

[22:07] <masak> moritz++

[22:07] <masak> nom: say Bool ~~ Real

[22:07] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Falseâ¤Â»

[22:08] <masak> nom: say int ~~ Real

[22:08] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:08] <masak> nom: say Int ~~ real

[22:08] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Could not find sub &realâ¤current instr.: '_block1002' pc 83 ((file unknown):138) (:1)â¤Â»

[22:08] <masak> oh, right :)

[22:09] <moritz> waiting for the 501x501 to finish, then -> sleep

[22:09] <moritz> or maybe I won't wait; I'm building a rakudo/master right now, that slows down the mandel a bit

[22:10] <moritz> but tomorrow I'll compare, and blog about it.

[22:26] <shiftless> hey all. I have a couple questions. #1 is threading implemented yet? #2 can anyone give me a quick rundown on how to do non blocking socket I/O?

[22:26] <pmichaud> threading NYI.  We're looking for spec suggestions.

[22:27] <shiftless> k

[22:27] <TimToady> there is rudimentary threading in niecza and pugs, but probably not non-blocking socket support, unless you dig down

[22:28] <shiftless> yeah, I'm pretty inexperienced with perl in general, and it seems the API has changed somewhat from perl5. tried digging through the PIR source but couldn't really figure out what functions were available or their parameters.

[22:28] <masak> people seem to be asking for non-blocking sockets quite a lot.

[22:28] <pmichaud> PIR source is going away soon anyway :)

[22:29] <TimToady> we need to write rakudo in a dialect of NQB, Not Quite Blocking...

[22:29] <shiftless> I mean, as far as figuring out the perl6 socket api. I guess that is an unfortunate fact of working with development code...very little documentation!

[22:30] <shiftless> well, I can probably do the implementation in perl5 for now and just port it later. 

[22:31] <masak> shiftless: part of the problem for non-blocking socket I/O is that none of the people involved in Rakudo seem to have any experience with them. at least AFAIK.

[22:32] <pmichaud> oh, I've had plenty of experience with non-blocking socket I/O.

[22:32] <pmichaud> I just don't have a need for it :)

[22:32] *** firefoxchic joined
[22:32] <masak> blog post! http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/june-24-2011-types

[22:33] <shiftless> i just basically want to build a server that listens for connections, then runs an event loop over connected sockets and does its thing. I think light weight threading with blocking I/O would probably be best anyway, whenever threads are ready.

[22:33] *** pernatiy left
[22:33] <pmichaud> masak: Array and Hash are Cool (at least they are/have been in rakudo)

[22:34] <pmichaud> rakudo:  say Array ~~ Cool

[22:35] <masak> oh, ok.

[22:35] <masak> makes sense, I guess.

[22:35] <masak> I'll redo the diagram :)

[22:39] <pmichaud> on the hunt for an unCool type

[22:39] <masak> yeah.

[22:39] <masak> besides Regex.

[22:39] <TimToady> Whatever

[22:39] <pmichaud> Signature

[22:39] <pmichaud> Method

[22:39] <pmichaud> Parameter

[22:39] <masak> haven't introduced those.

[22:40] <masak> Parameter?

[22:40] <pmichaud> Grammar

[22:40] <masak> haven't talked about any of those...

[22:40] <pmichaud> Instant

[22:40] <masak> well, I did mention Whatever...

[22:40] <TimToady> it can also stand in for "whatever..."  :)

[22:40] <masak> though not under that name.

[22:41] <pmichaud> DateTime

[22:41] <pmichaud> Date

[22:42] <pmichaud> Duration

[22:42] <masak> haven't talked about any of those. but thanks :)

[22:42] <pmichaud> well, it's all the Cool classes that get talked about first :)

[22:42] <masak> I'm trying to have 0 forward references.

[22:44] <pmichaud> Maybe this is the point where some of them get referenced for the first time, then.  

[22:44] <pmichaud> You could introduce Sub here, since you've talked about subs.

[22:44] <masak> ooh

[22:45] <masak> rakudo: say Sub ~~ Cool

[22:45] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:45] <masak> oh man :/

[22:45] <masak> why in the world is Sub Cool?

[22:45] <pmichaud> nom: say Sub ~~ Cool

[22:45] <p6eval> nom: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:45] <pmichaud> I don't know.

[22:45] <pmichaud> that seems... wrongish.

[22:45] * masak votes "no"

[22:45] <masak> rakudo: say Routine ~~ Cool

[22:45] <TimToady> rakudo: say +sub foo {}

[22:46] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:46] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«maximum recursion depth exceededâ¤  in 'Cool::Numeric' at line 1921:src/gen/core.pmâ¤  in 'Cool::Numeric' at line 1921:src/gen/core.pmâ¤  in 'Cool::Num' at line 1:src/gen/core.pmâ¤  in 'Cool::Numeric' at line 1921:src/gen/core.pmâ¤  in 'Cool::Numeric' at line 1921:src/gâ€¦

[22:46] <masak> fat lot of good being Cool does it :P

[22:46] <TimToady> yeah, that's uncool

[22:46] <masak> decidedly.

[22:46] <pmichaud> jnthn++ has a lot of stuff as being Cool that I'm not so sure I agree with.

[22:46] <masak> I'll mark it as uncool in *my* diagram, and hope Rakudo catches up.

[22:47] <TimToady> just spec it

[22:47] <masak> but having Routine in there is really good.

[22:47] <masak> gives the tree a bit more treeishness.

[22:48] <masak> rakudo: say Regex ~~ Routine

[22:48] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:49] <TimToady> d'oh

[22:49] <masak> rakudo: say Whatever ~~ Routine

[22:49] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Falseâ¤Â»

[22:49] <masak> phew :)

[22:50] <masak> TimToady: why "d'oh"? a Regex is a kind of Method.

[22:50] <TimToady> you could introduce the fact that there's always more types than you know about

[22:50] <masak> yes, good idea.

[22:51] *** xhacktly left
[22:52] <pmichaud> anyone disagree with moving Code/Signature/Attribute/etc. out of Cool ?

[22:52] <pmichaud> it's apparently been Cool since the cool branch was first merged into Rakudo (april 2010)

[22:52] <TimToady> "Not I!" said the little green pig.

[22:52] <masak> maybe it was an April Cool's joke.

[22:53] <pmichaud> fixing in nom. 

[22:53] <masak> \o/

[22:53] <masak> what's the relation between Code and Routine, btw?

[22:53] <pmichaud> Routine ~~ Code

[22:53] <pmichaud> Code is the base class for executable stuff

[22:54] <pmichaud> (unless it isn't :-)

[22:54] <TimToady> rakudo: say Block ~~ Routine

[22:54] <masak> Routine is something you can &return from?

[22:54] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Falseâ¤Â»

[22:54] <masak> ok, so Code contains Block and Routine?

[22:54] <masak> rakudo: say WhateverCode ~~ Code

[22:54] <p6eval> rakudo 1fcb14: OUTPUTÂ«Bool::Trueâ¤Â»

[22:54] <lichtkind> good night

[22:55] <masak> good night, child of light.

[22:56] <TimToady> and good light, all children of night...

[22:57] <pmichaud> Routine is something you return from, plus it also establishes new $_ $! $/  values instead of getting them from an outer scope

[22:57] <masak> ah.

[23:04] <pmichaud> okay.

[23:05] <masak> yes -- it's really Regex <: Method <: Routine

[23:05] <pmichaud> I was thinking Method ~~ Sub for some reason.

[23:06] <masak> I'm glad that's not the case :P

[23:06] <pmichaud> nom: say Sub ~~ Cool;  # updated, yet?

[23:07] <pmichaud> I wonder if it's worth fixing in master.

[23:07] <pmichaud> might be worth fixing and seeing if anything breaks as a result.

[23:08] <pmichaud> I can also use that as the opportunity to tie down 'make spectest' to an appropriate commit
