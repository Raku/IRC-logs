[06:28] <TiMBuS> hey jnthn, does blizkost let you use perl5 subs without using eval?

[06:29] <TiMBuS> i see it lets you use modules

[06:32] *** arlinius left
[06:37] <sorear> TiMBuS: yes

[06:37] <sorear> I've all but taken over blizkost

[06:38] <sorear> (it turns out that interfacing to Perl5 without using the standard interface is horrible)

[06:39] <TiMBuS> i see

[06:39] <TiMBuS> so um how do you do it? say i wanted to use Digest::MD5's exported 'md5_hex' sub

[06:40] <TiMBuS> i know i can use the oo version just fine

[06:42] <sorear> use Digest::MD5:from<perl5>; say md5_hex(...)

[06:43] <TiMBuS> really?

[06:44] *** amkrankruleuen left
[06:44] <TiMBuS> Could not find sub &md5_hex

[06:45] <TiMBuS> aw

[06:46] <sorear> I guess it wasn't actually exported

[06:47] <sorear> then, you'll need to use my &md5_hex = eval '\&Digest::MD5::md5_hex', :lang<perl5>;

[06:47] *** kanishka left
[06:47] <TiMBuS> dang

[16:12] <daxim> it's a vestigial class

[18:09] <sorear> NIECZA_HIGHWATER_TRACE=1 tells me that the hang occurred in the middle of trying to strip whitespace from a heredoc

[18:10] <sorear> which ... kinda sounds newline related

[19:55] <masak> I think backslashes are a decent sacrifice for introducting whitespace in the middle of a term.

[19:56] <masak> and it's sorta-kinda congruent with what you have to do in bash et al when breaking lines.

[19:56] <flussence> that makes it sound a lot more sense-making

[19:57] <masak> I don't use it a lot myself, but I also wouldn't have a problem using it.

[19:58] <moritz_> if your map -> grep -> map -> join whatever statements become too long, they get hard to read

[19:58] <masak> aye.

[19:58] <masak> series of map -> grep -> map -> join are things I tend to want to vertically align to make the repetition stand out.

[19:59] <moritz_> that often helps, aye

[20:00] <masak> oh, and this week's Perl 5/6 braino: trying to use 'for' to loop over a diamond operator in Perl 5 :)

[20:01] <masak> just 2.5 years ago, I distinctly remember half-cursing over having to use 'for' for that in Perl 6... :)

[20:01] <donri> wait you have to backslash that?

[20:02] <masak> donri: TTIAR :)

[20:02] <flussence> Definitely more readable even with the backslashes - old: http://github.com/flussence/Text-Tabs-Wrap/blob/0c23ad1/lib/Text/Wrap.pm#L123 new: https://github.com/flussence/Text-Tabs-Wrap/blob/cleanup/lib/Text/Wrap.pm#L117

[20:02] <donri> ?

[20:02] <donri> two terms etc ok

[20:02] <masak> yes.

[20:02] <donri> but ; should disambiguate just fine?

[20:02] <moritz_> masak: it kinda works in p5. It just reads all the file into memory

[20:02] <donri> I guess it reads as $_.join

[21:04] <masak> right. infix:<-> binds tighter than infix:<|>.

[21:08] <moritz_> masak: re $a ..^ $b vs. $a .. ($b - 1) depends on whether you want $b - 0.1 to match the range or not

[21:08] <masak> oh, I had some implicit context, it seems.

[21:08] <masak> I was talking about for loop ranges.

[21:09] <masak> I actually hesitate between the two sometimes :)

[21:09] <masak> and even more between $a ..^ $b - 1 and $a .. $b - 2

[21:10] <moritz_> there it's easy for me: $b - 2 wins

[21:11] <moritz_> because ^ $b - 1 distributes the offset into two separate constructs

[21:11] <moritz_> which makes the intent less clear

[21:11] <masak> to me it's not that clear-cut.

[21:11] <masak> sometimes the surrounding code uses ..^ $b

[21:12] <moritz_> to me ^ means "an epsilon less"

[21:12] <moritz_> which doesn't make much sense for integers

[21:12] <moritz_> so I tend not to use it with integers, except when golfing

[21:13] <sbp> maybe your definition is broken? :-)

[21:16] <masak> flussence: I'm a ternary guy, and I'd use them in any such situation.

[21:16] <sbp> so why the behaviour of $a ..^ $b?

[21:16] <masak> flussence: ifs-with-assignment-to-the-same-variable, that's a clear ternary refactor to me.

[21:16] <sbp> it seems only related to the behaviour of the above

[21:17] <moritz_> in both cases it means "up to but exluding"

[21:17] <masak> sbp: because in list context, ranges collapse into a list of values steps of 1 between them.

[21:17] <masak> rakudo: say (2.5 .. 7.5).list.perl

[21:17] <sbp> so again, why avoid using it because of the definition...

[21:18] <sbp> if the glove fits, you must compile

[21:18] <flussence> hm, the perl5 was originally a ternary... not as nicely formatted though :)

[21:18] <moritz_> sbp: maybe it's irrational

[21:19] <sbp> if there's some rationale behind the design of ^ that makes it incompatible with the present use in $a ..^ $b for integer ranges, are you arguing that it shouldn't be allowed there?

[21:19] <moritz_> not at all

[21:20] *** orafu left
[21:21] <sbp> then what are you saying? that it's conceptually clumsy, but not conceptually outrageous?

[21:22] <masak> in more detail.

[21:22] <moritz_> I'm merely saying that *I* think of ^ in terms of epsilons, because of the smart-matching behavior

[21:23] <moritz_> and that's why I feel they are not a perfect fit for integer iterations, even though it works

[21:27] <masak> \o/

[21:27] <moritz_> of course this can be made much easier

[21:28] <moritz_> since the the last item of the sequence is the same as 2 - the cummulative value

[21:28] <diakopter> seen masak

[21:28] <aloha> masak was last seen in #perl6 52 seconds ago saying "\o/".

[22:03] <colomon> as usual, have a list of things I should have brought but didn't.  but it seems my only major mistake was in handling the rakudo grant money I got.  :)
