[06:45] <masak> diakopter: "re" comes out meaning approximately "regarding", but it's really the ablative form of the Latin word rēs, meaning "matter"/"affair"/"thing"; so "re" literally means "in the matter". the "regarding" meaning is a fortunate back-breviation. :)

[06:49] <sorear> hehehe

[06:49] <sorear> masak, I wrote an implementation of your game

[06:49] <sorear> but it's 116 lines :/

[06:50] <moritz> so what? show the code :-)

[06:50] <phenny> moritz: 21 Jul 21:32Z <pmichaud> tell moritz see http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2011-07-21#i_4149417

[06:50] <moritz> good morning

[06:50] <tadzik> g'morning

[06:50] <sorear> hmm.  how does the pushing-to-gists thing work?

[06:51] <tadzik> I think you need to create a gist with the website, and then clone the repo

[06:51] * sorear wonders whether to leave it as a comment or what

[06:51] <tadzik> oh, I see what you mean

[06:51] <sorear> I have code, I'm wondering what the Best(tm) way to share it is

[06:52] <sorear> preferably a way that semantically links it to masak's gist?

[06:52] *** f00li5h left
[06:52] <tadzik> maybe forking a gist and adding a file to it

[06:53] <sorear> unrelated: /me has discovered the new open source J and is playing with it, game of life in 45 characters :>

[06:57] <masak> (forking and adding a file)++

[06:57] <sorear> masak: was that a "do this."?

[06:57] <masak> aye.

[06:57] <masak> sorear: I'm very interested in seeing your solution.

[06:58] <masak> I might also add that we're (tadzik and I) gearing towards making it easy for people to develop (trading) strategies for the game and pitting them against each other.

[06:59] <masak> my implementation from yesterday weighs in at 43 lines sans tests, but I haven't done the trade bit yet. after just having taken a shower though, I do not believe that bit will be extremely big.

[06:59] <sorear> :/

[06:59] <sorear> 116 with trading

[06:59] <moritz> pmichaud++ # finding my bug

[07:00] <masak> sorear: should I upload my code for you to look at?

[07:01] <sorear> https://gist.github.com/1099007#file_sorear.pl6

[07:01] <sorear> sure

[07:02] <sorear> The only obvious way to significantly shrink mine is to remove all the rule-enforcing code

[07:03] <masak> without having looked, it sounds like we have widely different approaches.

[07:03] <masak> that said, tadzik and I tried with an OO-based solution day before yesterday, and it became quite bloated, which is why I wanted the 100-LoC restriction.

[07:04] <masak> sorear: https://github.com/masak/farm

[07:05] <masak> heh -- we both have a routine called 'transfer' :P

[07:06] <sorear> I see you also found the biggest simplification in mine (treating stock as a player)

[07:06] <masak> aye.

[07:07] <masak> it is a player in the sense of having animals, but not in the sense of having turns.

[07:09] <masak> here's my plan for trading: each player gets to inject a trade callback into the game. this callback takes a deep clone of %.p as a parameter, plus its name. it emits a regular animal trading hash.

[07:10] <masak> now, if the other player is a player and not the stock, it has its accept_trade callback called, with the animal trading hash passed along. it replies booleanly.

[07:10] <masak> and that's all the strategy there is.

[07:10] <sorear> doesn't it also need to return who to trade with?

[07:11] <masak> yes, but that's part of the trading hash. see the return value of .transfer

[07:11] * sorear has a feeling there are strong elements of iterated prisoners' dilemma here

[07:11] <moritz> in practice, how often is the stock depleted of one sort of animal?

[07:11] <masak> I sure am interested in seeing what a good stable strategy will be like.

[07:11] <masak> moritz: rabbits breed like... well... :P

[07:12] <moritz> $ ./perl6 -e 'my $x = 1; say $::("x")'

[07:12] <moritz> 1

[07:12] <masak> moritz: tadzik and I were playing a two-player game. I get the feeling that the pressure on all types of animals (esp big dogs) is much heavier when more players are playing.

[07:12] <moritz> $ >./perl6 -e 'say &::("sort").(5, 3, 4, 1)'

[07:12] <moritz> 1 3 4 5

[07:12] <sorear> hmm.

[07:13] <moritz> masak: is the stock equipped with more animals in the case of multiple players?

[07:13] <sorear> masak: got host04 access? :)

[07:13] <masak> moritz: no.

[07:13] <masak> sorear: no.

[07:14] *** JimmyZ_ joined
[07:15] <JimmyZ_> Is there a syntax like 'use longname as name'  or 'import longname as name'?

[07:15] <sorear> masak: I am considering to install mono on feather then let everyone with a feather acct do an online game

[07:15] <sorear> masak: is this an awesome idea?

[07:16] <masak> sorear: yes!

[07:16] <JimmyZ_> looks like I asked it before, but I forgot it.

[07:16] <sorear> JimmyZ_: use Name:name<Long::Name>

[07:16] <masak> JimmyZ_: there isn't out of the box, but it sounds like a good idea.

[07:16] <masak> oh! what sorear said ;)

[07:20] <sorear> who's the resident feather admin guru?

[07:20] <tadzik> sorear: I think you allow stock to have negative amount of animals

[07:20] <tadzik> or maybe not, my $gain = ($total div 2) min %players<stock>{$animal};

[07:21] <tadzik> nice one

[07:21] <masak> sorear++

[07:21] <JimmyZ_> thanks,  it's not friendly for non-english speaker, I can't find it in S11 easily

[07:22] <JimmyZ_> Pooch is longer than Dog

[07:22] <masak> JimmyZ_: thank you for your efforts with the spec. they are valuable.

[07:22] <moritz> sorear: nobody really administrates feather, which is part of the problem

[07:22] <masak> JimmyZ_: people might use :name for other reasons than shortening.

[07:23] <JimmyZ_> masak: yes, i.e : names conflict

[07:23] <masak> right.

[07:23] * sorear upgrades feather's gcc

[07:26] <JimmyZ_> S11:428 is a class 	S11:428

[07:27] <sorear> errr

[07:28] <sorear> yes, line 534 is the real one

[07:28] <JimmyZ_> S11:535 doesn't describe what use Name:name<Long::Name> means

[07:28] <sorear> I remember this first came up when I asked TimToady how use java.net.Socket:from<java> was supposed to parse

[07:28] <sorear> he said "it's use Socket:from<java>:name<java.net.Socket>"

[07:28] *** perlhack left
[07:29] <JimmyZ_> sorear, line 534 doesn't describe what use Name:name<Long::Name> means too

[07:29] <JimmyZ_> what's why I saw, but I can't find it

[07:30] <JimmyZ_> that's why I saw this line, but I can't find it

[07:31] <masak> sorear: I'm playing your game. I think any comparison between our two pieces of code is a bit unfair, because you have this nice trading syntax, and I'm just focusing on the game logic.

[07:31] <masak> for me, the interface will be a completely different part and likely not count in the 100 LoC. maybe.

[07:32] <JimmyZ_> does 'class Ninja is also { }'   equal 'use MONKEY_TYPING; argument class Ninja {}'

[07:33] <masak> JimmyZ_: the former syntax is a fossil.

[07:35] <masak> sorear: after I had player 1 trade with himself, I get the trade-if-any prompt again. I cannot see why from your code, but that shouldn't happen.

[07:36] <masak> sorear: @wdie[rand * @wdie] -- why not .roll? if it's not implemented in Niecza, is it LHF? :)

[07:37] <sorear> LHF in that case. :)

[19:43] <sorear> ?

[19:44] <masak> sorear: all trades must be 1-1, 1-many, or many-1. many-many isn't allowed, apparently.

[19:44] <masak> it's a small thing, but now that we're aware of it, the rule booklet is quite clear.

[19:44] <sorear> ah.

[19:45] <[Coke]> masak: what are you talking about?

[19:46] <masak> [Coke]: hah, you've missed the latest craze and need to backlog a day or so :P

[19:46] <masak> "Little Animal Farm". a Polish family game from the 1940s.

[19:47] <masak> in the span of about 24 hours, it now has three partial implementations (by tadzik, me, and sorear)

[19:48] <sorear> added the many-many restriction

[19:49] <sorear> so who's in on the ssh gaming craze?

[19:49] <[Coke]> masak: nifty. (first google hit is you). Will consider making a hard copy out of my copious counters to try with the kids.

[19:49] <masak> sorear: tadzik and I are here, but kinda making nom a bit too :)

[19:49] <sorear> I love how that sentence is ambiguous.

[19:49] <masak> first Google hit is me? wow, that was fast.

[19:51] <masak> ah, ok :)

[19:51] <masak> moritz: are you in?

[19:52] <moritz> masak: yes-ish

[19:53] <masak> sounds like us over here :)

[19:54] <masak> ok, so we're potentially 4 players.

[19:55] <PerlJam> If a roll turns up a fox and the player has a big dog does that have the same effect as the player having a small dog?

[19:55] * moritz currently chats with stevan about MOPs, so can't muster the concentration for playing a game

[19:55] <masak> oh btw, we're planning to bring a few sets of this game to YAPC::EU :)

[19:55] <masak> PerlJam: no.

[19:55] <sorear> mmm MOPs

[19:56] <masak> moritz: understandable :)

[19:56] <sorear> masak: you have official sets?

[19:56] <masak> sorear: yes, I bought one from the Warsaw Uprising Museum.

[19:57] <masak> sorear: the original sets were all destroyed in the big firebombing, save for one that had been transported out of town.

[19:57] <masak> sorear: the current sets are based on it.

[19:57] <masak> they're gorgeous, and have this fake 1940s feel to them.

[19:58] <masak> sorear: we'll just finish making the pasta over here; then we can play. :)

[19:58] <PerlJam> seems like it would behoove you to trade for a small dog and a big dog as soon as possible.

[19:59] <pmichaud> dogs have paws, not hooves.  :-)

[19:59] <sorear> I have some theories about strategy, but I'm going to test them before sharing :D

[20:00] <sorear> I suppose masak&tadzik are already experts

[20:00] <PerlJam> so ... now that there's a game engine, the next logical thing to do is create a program that plays the game  :)

[20:02] <masak> PerlJam: already on it :P

[20:03] <masak> waaay ahead of you... :)

[20:03] <masak> sorear: no, we're not experts, at least not me.

[20:03] <PerlJam> Of course.  I figured as much

[20:03] <masak> sorear: we've only actually played it once, and tadzik had a bit of bad luck with foxes.

[20:04] <PerlJam> pmichaud: you missed some good BBQ today.  We're doing another on Aug 26 for John's retirement if you want to make a trip down here :)

[20:05] <PerlJam> masak: See?  he should have traded for a small dog often  :)

[20:05] <tadzik> hmm, actually I know this game for like 10 years already :)

[20:05] <pmichaud> PerlJam: It's on my calendar... but given that's the first week of school in Plano I doubt I'll be able to make it.  :)

[20:05] <masak> tadzik: really? it was hard to tell :P

[20:06] * masak is too cocky because he won by luck

[20:06] <sorear> For as much as Perl 6 claims to be "The operator-oriented language", J pretty clearly surpasses us on that design axis

[20:06] <masak> sorear: without a doubt.

[20:07] <tadzik> oh, not entirely by luck :)

[20:07] * sorear is playing with J while waiting

[20:07] <masak> but Perl 6 slides better along the operator-enterprisey spectrum.

[20:07] <masak> sorear: any minute now.

[20:11] <TimToady> .oO(if all you've got is an operator, everything starts to look like an operand)

[20:12] <masak> and if all you have is Java, everything starts to look like a bean? :)

[20:12] <tadzik> I read that as a beer

[20:12] <[Coke]> mmm, beer.

[20:12] <diakopter> mmm, beans

[20:13] <masak> eastern Poland is wonderful. not only do they have very nice beer, they also have kwass! \o/

[20:14] * TimToady wonders whether we'll ever see the end of June from masak++

[20:14] <tadzik> maybe they're paid clowns

[20:20] <masak> shoot.

[20:21] <masak> yay :)

[20:21] <sorear> is it correct that it takes a couple turns to get off the ground?

[20:21] <masak> oh, sure.

[20:21] <masak> it's .25 chance to get your first rabbit.

[20:21] <tadzik> sorear: it is also possible for everything to get back to zero

[20:21] <sorear> do wolves attack everyone?  I just have them attacking the player who rolled them

[20:22] <masak> sorear: no, just the player.

[20:24] <sorear> ooh, masak gets the first move

[20:24] <sorear> was that correct?

[20:24] <masak> think so.

[20:24] <sorear> first trade, then spawn

[20:24] <tadzik> yes

[20:24] <masak> aye.

[20:32] <masak> sorear: found a bug.

[20:32] <sorear> ?

[20:32] <masak> I got

[20:32] <masak> 3 rabbits 1 sheep 2 pigs

[20:32] <masak> that's not possible.

[20:33] <masak> you only get what the dice show.

[20:33] <sorear> what lines?

[20:33] <tadzik> [3] Adds 1 sheep(s)

[20:33] <tadzik> from the trade maybe?

[20:33] <masak> oh! or is that 'add' part of the trade?

[20:34] <sorear> no, you got 1 sheep from the trade (you now have a sheep) then you have a pair with the dice

[20:34] <tadzik> so where did masak get 3 rabbits?

[20:34] <masak> sorear: right, but where do the rabbits come from?

[20:34] <sorear> you had 12, you traded 6 away, you still had 6

[20:35] <tadzik> but now he has 9

[20:35] <tadzik> and dices were pig and sheep

[20:35] <masak> <masak> you only get what the dice show.

[20:35] <sorear> 6 + 6/3 = 9

[20:35] <masak> sorear: non-die animals don't breed.

[20:35] <sorear> oh!

[20:35] <masak> :)

[20:35] <[Coke]> masak: that's not clear from your readme.

[20:35] <masak> if so, sorry 'bout that. :/

[20:36] <[Coke]> "player already has 3 rabbits, rolls at least one rabbit => 2 pairs. that gives the player 2 rabbits"

[20:36] <[Coke]> that sounds like the non-rolled rabbits count as pairs.

[20:36] <masak> keep playing? I vote yes.

[20:36] <masak> [Coke]: they do, but only when the die shows the animal.

[20:38] <moritz> do all animals breed like that?

[20:39] <tadzik> yes

[20:39] <masak> except dogs :)

[20:39] <masak> (because they're not on the dice)

[20:40] <moritz> so they can only be acquired by trading

[20:40] <masak> aye.

[20:40] <tadzik> like cows and horses

[20:40] <tadzik> 'cos both are only on one of the dices

[20:42] <sorear> note, the current process has a bug where all animals breed

[20:42] <tadzik> cowstorm!

[20:42] <sorear> I have however fixed it

[20:42] * masak guessed that :)

[20:42] <masak> sorear++

[20:42] <masak> nice round.

[20:42] <tadzik> aye

[20:43] <masak> I'll update the README.md

[20:45] <masak> pushed.

[20:45] <moritz> what's the gist URL?

[20:55] <masak> moritz: yes. implementing it as we speak.

[20:55] <masak> its absence corresponds to one failing test at the end :)

[20:55] <moritz> :-)

[20:56] <moritz> so, you can just map the value of any animal to number of rabbits?

[20:56] <tadzik> yes

[20:56] <masak> rabbits, the universal currency.

[20:57] <moritz> so what's the total worth of all animals in the game, calculated in rabbit units? :-)

[20:58] *** M_o_C left

[20:59] <sorear> cows and horses are the largest store of value in the stock

[21:01] <moritz> if I didn't have nom to hack on, I'd now be doing some modelling about when one typically reaches his first big dog

[21:01] <masak> :)

[21:03] <moritz> purely from looking at the rules, it seems that one should store one assets mostly in cows (and a big dog for protection)

[21:04] <tadzik> if you have positive number of cows you don't really need to store them :)

[21:04] <tadzik> well, 2 and more

[21:04] <tadzik> 4 cows win the game

[21:05] <tadzik> and experience shows that you want to invest in rabbits, they breed Fast

[21:06] <masak> indeed.

[21:06] <TimToady> .oO("You enter a barnyard.  You see two rabbits...no, make that four...wait...")

[21:06] <masak> the small dog is good for securing your rabbit supply.

[21:06] <TimToady> but the dog might be in the crypt

[21:06] <masak> surely not :)

[21:07] <masak> so after this last game I consider it more vital than a sheep.

[21:10] <masak> moritz: implemented fair trade. 87 lines.

[21:10] <masak> I can think of no more rules to implement in the game.

[21:10] <masak> time to make a CLI, I think.

[21:11] <TimToady> 'course there's also the capitalist version, with spots on the board like Pork Place and Bleat Walk

[21:15] <TimToady> I guess that'd be Breedwalk if you're a rabbit

[21:18] <dalek> rakudo/nom: a52ea8f | moritz++ | src/Perl6/Metamodel/MROBased (2 files):

[21:18] <dalek> rakudo/nom: fix newlines in two MOP files; no functional changes

[21:18] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a52ea8fcb6

[21:18] <masak> 'night, moritz++

[21:29] <masak> oh! I forgot to implement accepting/declining a trade :)

[21:29] <masak> oh well. something for tomorrow.

[21:30] <masak> oh! and the winning condition. oh, man. :/

[21:32] * masak is teetering around 100 LoC now

[21:33] <TimToady> you should be able to get it all on one line

[21:36] <masak> I guess I forgot to mention my column restriction...

[21:36] <tadzik> you should be able to get it in one column :)

[21:38] <masak> ok, you guys aren't allowed to touch my code. :P

[21:40] <sorear> i'd be interested in seeing one column version

[21:40] *** ab5tract left
[21:41] <tadzik> it depends on how wide is that column

[21:42] <masak> not even wide Asian characters will save you, methinks.

[21:42] <sorear> for bonus points, make it an ASCII densitygram of a proper Ionic column

[21:42] <tadzik> if we encode that in utf-32 we may be able to put 4 characters in a column

[21:43] <tadzik> or something like this :)

[21:43] <sorear> nobody wants another round with sorear.pl6?

[21:44] <sorear> meh, Psyche is a great name for a p6er

[21:44] <masak> sorear: not today; maybe after I land tomorrow :)

[21:44] *** Patterner left
[21:44] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[21:44] <sorear> .oO( masak must be falling from a truly great height)

[21:44] <masak> in a manner of speaking, yes.

[21:45] <masak> Warsaw truly is great.

[21:45] <tadzik> don't worry, it's only the 3rd floor

[21:45] <masak> tadzik tries pushing me out on the balcony as a joke. wait, this chair has wheels...? :)

[21:46] <masak> hold on, tadzik! let's talk about this!

[21:46] <tadzik> heh, masak already knows the Mars Mission story/legend

[21:46] <tadzik> so a couple of students get so drunk that they put a guy in a box labeled "Mars Mission" and drop him out of the window

[21:47] <tadzik> when the police breaks into the flat, they see the second guy in a box labeled "Rescue Mission"

[21:47] <masak> I still haven't decided if that story is funny or sad, or a little bit of both.

[21:47] <tadzik> I hope it's fake

[21:48] <masak> you never know with students.

[21:48] <sorear> well I don't get the humor

[21:48] <tadzik> yeah, thanks :)

[21:48] <tadzik> sorear: the humour (or not), is that this is supposed to be a true story from the Warsaw student's house Alcatraz

[21:50] *** bluescreen10 left
[21:50] *** impious left
[21:51] <masak> googling for "warsaw alcatraz mars mission" turns up nothing in particular. so it's probably just a story.

[21:51] <flussence> .oO( Warsaw apparently has very unpredictable gravity... )

[21:52] <sorear> tadzik: I still don't understand the joke

[21:52] <tadzik> http://atrapa.net/legendy/misjanamarsa.htm -- first hit on google with polish keywords

[21:52] <sorear> unless it's a reference to the prison in my backyard

[21:53] <masak> sorear: I'll give it a go. throwing someone out a window while drunk isn't that funny. being about to throw a second person out the window after the first one is... kinda funny. :)

[21:53] <tadzik> to rescue the first one
