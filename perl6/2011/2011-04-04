[08:23] <tadzik> a Role for the Grammar is not trivial, so the sanest thing will be to make it separate, and carefully integrate it (manually) into Rakudo. No magic, but it's still available for other implementations

[08:24] <tadzik> at one moment it may turn out it's impossible to develop it outside, but the later the better I guess

[08:24] <tadzik> oh, whatever, I tank too much :)

[08:24] <moritz> tadzik: what you can do is to develop it as a separate class in the beginning (reduced compilation time)

[08:25] <tadzik> yeah, the compilation time is what I'm mostly thinkging about for practical reasons

[08:25] <moritz> tadzik: and mix in a role that supplies those rules that are normally available in the p6 grammar that you use (like <identifier>)

[08:25] *** gabiruh joined
[08:26] <moritz> tadzik: and then a small script that extracts rules and puts them into src/Perl6/Grammar.pm

[08:26] <moritz> and use the result as soon as you are working on the .WHY integration etc.

[08:26] <moritz> and $=THING variables

[08:26] <tadzik> yeah

[08:59] <tadzik> sorry guys for bothering you all with this :)

[09:01] <moritz> speaking of bothering you all...

[09:01] <moritz> I've been thinking more about my exception grant

[09:02] <moritz> one thing that seems sensible is to separate the object that fail() returns

[09:02] <moritz> and the actual exception information

[09:03] <moritz> so fail() should return an object with a minimum of possible methods, so that accidental use as a value results in a new exception

[09:03] <moritz> let's call it Failure for now

[09:03] <jnthn> $failure.exception # an accessor for the exception?

[09:03] <moritz> yes

[09:03] <moritz> though I'd call it .EXCEPTION or so :-)

[09:03] <moritz> or .EX

[09:03] <moritz> bikeshedding

[09:03] <moritz> the important part is that I think a has-a relation is nedded

[09:03] <jnthn> I've tended to hear Failure discussed as a role that gets mixed into things

[09:03] <jnthn> (has-a) +1

[09:04] <moritz> and that maybe CATCH blocks automatically unwrap those objects

[09:04] <moritz> wheres the real "meat" of the exception should be pleasant to work with (easy to stringify and query for properties)

[09:04] <jnthn> CATCH blocks don't get invoked with a failure, though?

[09:04] *** knewt2_ joined
[09:05] <moritz> hm

[09:05] <jnthn> Not until it's used, and then it throws its exception?

[09:05] <moritz> right

[09:05] <jnthn> But then it's the usage of the failure that does the "unpacking".

[09:05] <moritz> right

[09:05] <jnthn> One issue that is worth considering is how we report these lazy errors. (more)

[09:06] <moritz> $! could contain the inner exception

[09:06] <jnthn> I suspect that you want to know where the exception woulda happened as well as where you actually caused it to happen.

[09:06] <moritz> aye

[09:06] <moritz> that's where the dual list/item nature of exceptions comes into play

[09:06] <moritz> maybe that should really be a linked list

[09:07] <moritz> so what the user sees is   "division by zero (silent) in sub divide_all (foo.pl:12)

[09:07] <moritz> rethrown in sub more-processing (foo.pl:42)

[09:08] <moritz> maybe an indented backtrace after each such message

[09:09] <jnthn> Something like that.

[15:56] <moritz> indeed :-)

[15:56] <jnthn> I did a talk at OSDC.TW that looked at building compilers with NQP and some basic 6model bits; slides: http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2011-osdc.tw-compiler.pdf and code: http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2011-osdc.tw-compiler-code.zip

[15:56] <jnthn> It shows a much, much smaller scale compiler and how it is built up, which is probably nice for anyone wanting to dig in, but finding the size of Rakudo or NQP overwhelming :)

[15:57] <colomon> btw, jnthn!  \o/

[16:37] <JimmyZ> jnthn , you have two subject talk in Taipei?

[16:38] <jnthn> JimmyZ: I had two talks, one on Perl 6, one on compilers.

[16:38] <jnthn> JimmyZ: But the Perl 6 one was the signatures talk, which I've given at other conferences, so I think most people here already saw that one.

[16:38] <jnthn> JimmyZ: OK, feel free to pass on any info.

[16:41] <JimmyZ> jnthn, I think you can submit these two talks to perlChina in beijing too. 

[16:43] <JimmyZ> parts of those guys are interested in your talk in Taipei, and enjoying your video talks

[16:47] *** hanekomu left
[16:48] <jdhore> I hate to be "that guy", but is it just me or has Perl 6 appeared to have slowed to a crawl?

[16:49] <jnthn> jdhore: You mean the speed it runs at, or the development? :)

[16:49] <jdhore> the development

[16:50] <jnthn> jdhore: Not really, but if you're watching just the Rakudo repository I can see why you'd get that impression.

[16:50] <jnthn> jdhore: All my work at the moment (and of late) is going in at the compiler toolkit level, but it's directly applicable to Rakudo.

[16:50] <jdhore> Well rakudo, parrot, perl6/*...all of them (parrot is fairly active, but it appears to be more minor cleanups than anything else)

[16:51] <JimmyZ> well, I guess some guys are watching repository all the time. 

[16:51] <jnthn> perl6/nqp was being quite active...then its main committer had the audacity to take a vacation. :P

[17:17] <jnthn> Taiwan was awesome, though I have to admit it's nice to be able to cross a road again without nearly getting run over by five scooters in the process. ;)

[17:17] <jnthn> masak: Yeah, I know, I'm jetlagged...it woulda been sooner otherwise ;P

[17:17] <masak> ah, five scooters. hate when that happens.

[17:17] <masak> jnthn: in your defense, it looks like low traffic on the channel this morning. :P

[17:19] <masak> <jaywalker> i want to know about perl 6

[17:19] <masak> ...and then he disappeared.

[17:19] <masak> guess the cops caught him crossing the street in the wrong place or something... :)

[17:19] <PerlJam> jnthn: Just looked at that talk.   The only thing unclear from the slides alone is how EXPR knows to call my <term>

[17:21] <jnthn> PerlJam: EXPR knows to call <term>. The only reason it calls your one is because the default only declares a proto.

[17:21] *** Vlavv joined
[17:22] <jnthn> PerlJam: It also knows to call infix, postfix, and prefix, which are handled the same way.

[17:22] <jnthn> term is no more magical than those :)

[17:22] <PerlJam> jnthn++ awesome slides

[17:22] <jnthn> Maybe the video is clearer...

[17:23] <jnthn> The real answer is we need good docs rather than just my talks for docs. ;)

[20:02] <jnthn> It didn't have the context to know it could throw away things.

[20:23] <moritz> it tells you exactly what's wrong :-)

[20:24] <masak> yeah. Rakudo's wrong. :P

[20:25] <moritz> it tells you that you need a first positional argument

[20:25] <masak> aye.

[20:25] <masak> I guess my point is, what's so bad about letting .split default to splitting on every character, just like .comb does?

[20:25] <moritz> feel free to add a () multi though, with a more awesoem error message

[20:27] <masak> or just have it DWIM.

[20:28] * moritz doesn't find it intuitive that a split without arguments splits at each character boundary

[20:28] <masak> ok.

[20:28] <masak> in that case, I won't add it. and I'm not sure a better error message is needed either.

[20:29] <moritz> it's just something you picked up somewhere, not something that makes sense by itself

[20:31] * PerlJam wonders what else an argumentless $str.split() would be expected to do ...

[20:32] <moritz> the equivalent of .words maybe

[20:32] <masak> or .lines

[20:32] <masak> or it could split on nothing, giving the original string. :)

[20:32] <moritz> right

[20:32] <moritz> on rx/ <!> / that is

[20:32] <masak> *that* would be even more unhelpful than the current error.

[20:33] *** Mowah left
[20:33] <PerlJam> Well, the error message is LTA in any case. 

[20:33] <PerlJam> Sure it says what's wrong, but in technical-ese instead of human.

[20:33] <PerlJam> :)

[20:33] <Eevee> if there's already a .words, requiring an argument for .split seems plenty sane to me.  just need less C++-y errors in general?  8)

[20:34] <masak> PerlJam: hm, but that could be said of *any* multi misdispatch.

[20:34] <frettled> rakudo: say 'abc'.split('')

[20:34] <p6eval> rakudo 4bf132: OUTPUT«abc␤»

[20:34] <frettled> rakudo: say 'abc'.split('').perl

[20:34] <p6eval> rakudo 4bf132: OUTPUT«("a", "b", "c")␤»

[20:34] <masak> \o/

[20:34] <masak> frettled++

[20:34] <masak> ...and that's a good argument for making 0-arg split do the same as 0-arg .comb. I think.

[20:35] <PerlJam> masak: indeed.  You can take my opinion on this topic to mean that I think we should provide nicer errors where we can anticipate certain uses (Accidental or otherwise)

[20:35] <moritz> note that argumentless split does something else in p5

[20:35] <moritz> masak: do you know where that expectation comes from?

[20:35] <masak> moritz: no, but I know it's in the context of just trying stuff out.

[20:36] <masak> moritz: the user was unable to diagnose the error himself, so he turned to me.

[20:36] <moritz> compare

[20:36] <moritz> $ perl -MData::Dumper -we '$_ = "ab\nc  d"; print Dumper [split]'

[20:37] <masak> indeed.

[20:37] <masak> let's not have that default behaviour :P

[20:38] <masak> I can see how that makes sense for Perl 5, which was targeting an awk-y niche.

[20:38] <masak> Perl 6 isn't, so it doesn't.

[20:39] <moritz> perl 6 has .words for that

[21:02] <tadzik> that's a stringification issue

[21:02] <masak> yes.

[21:02] <tadzik> well that's a bug as well :)

[21:02] <masak> I already realized that was the case.

[21:02] <masak> it's in the RT ticket.
