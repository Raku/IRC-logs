[02:34] <ingy> what's the best place to build a modern, but somewhat stable, rakudo from?

[02:34] <colomon> ingy: well, Rakudo Star's latest release was yesterday.

[02:35] <colomon> so you could use that or github, they're both about equal at the moment, I'd guess.

[02:35] <ingy> :)

[02:35] <ingy> is there a star branch of the rakudo repo

[02:36] <ingy> or should I use the rakudo-star repo

[02:37] <ingy> maybe the 2011.04 tag

[02:37] *** drbean left
[02:37] <colomon> rakudo's 2011.04 would be last week's release.

[02:37] <colomon> which is probably pretty much the same, but if you want the latest and greatest....  :)

[02:38] <ingy> I just want to fix my out of date modules that tadzik pointed out.

[02:38] <colomon> seriously, Rakudo is pretty stable at the moment; the major development at the moment is off in another repo.

[02:38] <ingy> cool

[02:39] <ingy> what's the tag of the latest star?

[02:39] *** drbean joined
[02:41] <colomon> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo

[02:41] *** ymasory left
[02:41] <colomon> (don't know the tag)

[02:42] <colomon> https://github.com/downloads/rakudo/star/rakudo-star-2011.04.tar.gz

[02:42] <colomon> is the latest

[02:42] <ingy> that's probably https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/tree/2011.04

[02:42] <ingy> :)

[02:43] <colomon> sounds likely.  :)

[10:48] <jnthn> nqp knows at compile time :)

[10:48] <moritz> \o/ good error messages at compile time in nqp

[10:48] <jnthn> moritz: It actually has the meta-objects to hand during the compile.

[10:48] <jnthn> So this even works with custom meta-classes.

[10:49] *** drbean left
[10:50] <moritz> how is the verification done? is there "give me a slot associate with attribute $!foo" method on the meta object?

[10:50] *** drbean joined
[10:50] <jnthn> moritz: At the moment it calls .^attributes(:local) and looks through them, but I'm considering having a method on the meta-object like "is_valid_attribute" or something

[10:51] <moritz> +1

[10:51] <jnthn> So that if you write something that doesn't require pre-declaration of attributes it'll just be able to say "yes, that's fine" always :)

[10:51] <moritz> also I wonder if .^attributes and .^methods should really return hashes, not lists

[10:52] <jnthn> Trouble is what the keys/values would be

[10:52] <jnthn> You may have multiple methods with the same name.

[10:52] <jnthn> Or attributes with the same name.

[10:52] <jnthn> From different places in the inheritance hierarchy.

[10:53] <moritz> hm, right

[11:25] <jnthn> *all

[11:27] <jnthn> Ой ля ля!

[11:28] <Layla_91> hahaha! :D

[11:29] <Layla_91> it seems that to learn a language the best solution is to move to a country that speaks it...

[11:29] <jnthn> Layla_91: Certainly.

[11:29] <Layla_91> so I need to visit 10 countries in the near future and stay 10 years in each :P

[11:30] <moritz> that's quite possible, if you can get the countries to overlap :-)

[11:30] <jnthn> Just live in disputed territories...

[11:30] <jnthn> :)

[11:31] <Layla_91> mmmm... good theory...

[11:31] *** drbean left
[11:31] * jnthn is really crappy at Swedish, but has sucked up loads of words just by living here for a year

[11:31] <Layla_91> jnthn: is it hard?

[11:31] *** drbean joined
[11:32] <Layla_91> jnthn: harder than russian?

[11:32] <moritz> I don't think Swedish is hard if you know other Germanic languages

[11:32] <jnthn> Layla_91: It's easier language for me to learn, since much more overlap with English.

[11:32] <moritz> I for one know German and English, and learning Norwegian (which is quite close to Swedish) doesn't feel very hard

[11:33] <moritz> (which doesn't imply I'm actually good at it... )

[11:33] <jnthn> Layla_91: It's mostly a problem of finding time and motivation to study it.

[11:33] <Layla_91> jnthn: btw i never asked about your original language (or forgot what is it! :s)

[11:33] <Layla_91> I guess moritz is german..

[11:34] <moritz> Layla_91: correct

[11:34] <jnthn> Layla_91: English. :)

[11:34] <jnthn> Layla_91: I'm originally from England. :)

[11:34] <Layla_91> jnthn: yaaaaaaaaaaaay! lsn you must teach me to speak your accent! :D

[11:35] <Layla_91> moritz: I kinda guessed based on your chat personality (The serious boy :P :D)

[11:35] <jnthn> Layla_91: My local dialect, or the one I use for the rest of the world? :)

[11:36] *** drbean left
[11:36] <Layla_91> jnthn: mmm... dunno :S I do not know the difference :$

[11:37] * moritz doesn't think this was a compliment :-)

[11:37] <jnthn> Layla_91: When I was living in Slovakia my teacher could understand my English just fine. Then a friend from my hometown came to visit me. When I talked to him I spoke Yorkshire dialect (not on purpose even), and she couldn't understand anything we said to each other!

[11:38] *** drbean joined
[11:38] <Layla_91> jnthn: ooooh! :S

[11:38] <jnthn> Layla_91: Anyway, just find some video of me speaking at a conference to see what my "normal" accent sounds like :)

[11:38] <Layla_91> jnthn: mmm.. will check on youtube :D

[11:39] <jnthn> Layla_91: not sure there are any there... http://video.osdc.tw/ has a couple

[11:39] <Layla_91> jnthn: have u used tcl before?! they need to write a script for a cisco device... I never tried it before...

[11:39] <Layla_91> jnthn: going to the link ;)

[11:40] <jnthn> Layla_91: No, never used it, though always wanted to write a testing framework for it.

[11:40] <jnthn> I'd call it test-tcl.

[11:40] <mberends> *groan*

[11:40] <Layla_91> moritz: you are a great and loyal friend I think :) your wife must be happy with you.. here you go.. a complement :P :D

[11:40] <jnthn> mberends: Sorry. Fixing char encoding bugs in legacy ASP code brings out the worst in me. :P

[11:41] <mberends> jnthn: just don't balls it up! ;)

[11:41] <moritz> Layla_91: you're too kind

[11:42] <tadzik> good noon

[11:51] <jnthn> Now I kinda can read them, I realize they're like "set x to zero" :/

[11:51] <tadzik> our Polish Open and Free Software foundation has recently ordered a few educational applications. The responsible person wrote them in Visual Basic, and sent them the source code in .doc format. Because .rtf was too big with the images

[11:53] <mberends> that's mind boggling :/

[17:51] <sbp> 10:20  <pmichaud> That's... not good.

[17:51] <sbp> 10:20  <moritz> agreed.

[17:51] <sbp> they're making a new one apparently

[17:51] <moritz> foodoo: it's being replaced with a new website due to reliability issues

[17:51] <colomon> foodoo: for the moment, try rakudoperl.org

[17:52] <sbp> pmichaud was asking people who wanted to register to author/admin it to register somewhere

[17:52] <foodoo> thanks

[17:52] <colomon> that's the new one (and rakudo.org will be pointing there ASAP)

[17:52] <moritz> foodoo: rakudoperl.org is a backup, rakudo.org will sooner or later point to the new location

[17:52] <sbp> further:

[17:52] <sbp> 10:20  <pmichaud> rakudoperl.org is a domain I already own; we'll hopefully get rakudo.org to forward to rakudoperl.org or something like that

[19:18] <moritz> agreed

[19:28] <sorear> masak: hi!

[19:30] <masak> sorear: hi!

[19:31] <masak> how's Niecza coming along?

[19:31] <sorear> pretty well - not many tuits right now

[19:31] <masak> know the feeling. :/

[19:31] <sorear> pmurias++ has been playing with an optimizer though

[19:31] <masak> ooh

[19:31] <sorear> the v5 release has been postponed

[19:32] <masak> yeah, I saw.

[19:32] <moritz> having a v5 release of v6 bears some irony :-)

[19:33] <masak> just wait until next month :P

[19:36] <fglock> sorear: hi!

[19:37] <sorear> fglock: hi

[20:01] <moritz> tadzik: after watching the first few minutes, it looks like from 2010 shortly after the first R* release

[20:01] <tadzik> well, when was the 35th Rakudo release?

[20:02] <masak> November 2010.

[20:02] *** arcus left
[20:02] <masak> (according to docs/release_guide.pod)

[20:02] <tadzik> 2010-11-18   Rakudo #35 "Melbourne"          (masak)

[20:02] <tadzik> aye

[20:07] <IllvilJa> 35th Rakudo release... sounds a bit like the 44th President of the United States or something.

[20:08] <masak> that's preposterous! Rakudo won't be elected president of the United States until 2037!

[20:08] <masak> er. I mean.

[20:09] <TimToady> world domination comes first

[20:10] *** snearch left

[20:11] <p6eval> rakudo 8533c3: OUTPUT«World Dominoes␤»

[20:11] <masak> \o/

[20:12] <fglock> :)

[20:12] <masak> I call dibs of toppling the first one! :)

[20:16] <TimToady> silly, they start at the other end

[20:18] <moritz> TheDamian gets one thing wrong in this presentation

[20:18] <moritz> he says that infix + is a method call on the left operand

[20:21] *** Rotwang joined
[20:22] <moritz> rakudo: $_ = "foo"; .=uc; .say

[20:22] <p6eval> rakudo 8533c3: OUTPUT«FOO␤»

[20:23] <tadzik> well, that looks uglyish

[20:24] <moritz> rakudo: $_ = "foo"; .= uc; .say

[20:24] <p6eval> rakudo 8533c3: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused at line 22, near ".= uc; .sa"␤»

[20:25] <sorear> yeah, it's actually a method call on BOTH operands :>

[20:26] <TimToady> actually, it's a method on the current language, as defined by the current lexical scope

[20:28] <TimToady> hence, + is defined by the language, not by either object

[20:28] <TimToady> this is especially important if either object is, say, a Python object

[20:32] <moritz> also TheDamian uses for (@list) {  } # note the parens

[20:35] <fglock> btw, experimenting with accessing the 'document' object in the browser: http://perlcabal.org/~fglock/perlito.html

[20:37] <IllvilJa> Are there any odds for getting perl 6 sneaked into the web browsers, similarly to how Javascript seem to be available "everywhere"?

[20:38] <moritz> IllvilJa: the odds are very low, because Perl 6 is a rather big language

[20:38] <IllvilJa> That would be quite a feat to get the language available there! (Imagine what you could do with Perl6 + the HTML5 Canvas element)

[20:38] <fglock> hmm - check the link above?

[20:38] <IllvilJa> moritz: understandable.

[20:38] <TimToady> implement the JS backend, and there you are...

[20:38] <foodoo> IllvilJa: Probably not. I read about the same discussion on the Lua mailinglist recently and Lua is a very small language

[20:38] <tadzik> nqp would be nice

[20:39] <fglock> IllvilJa: http://perlcabal.org/~fglock/perlito.html

[20:39] <moritz> fglock: I think the question was more about built into the browser

[20:40] <dalek> specs: 8f8d30e | moritz++ | S32-setting-library/Exception.pod:

[20:40] <dalek> specs: [S32::Exception] start to rewrite the exception spec

[20:40] <dalek> specs: review: https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/8f8d30e799

[20:40] <TimToady> new RS entry, http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Vector_products#Perl_6

[20:40] <sorear> everybody seems to want their favorite language built into browsers

[20:41] *** hudnix left
[20:41] <sorear> as if it would somehow be a good thing for browsers to contain 50 independant 2MB language runtimes

[20:41] <TimToady> at one point there was talk of embedding parrot, but that's been...de-emphasized...

[20:41] <masak> I for one would like to see Perl 6 on Android.

[20:41] <moritz> TimToady: it would need a good security model for that

[20:42] <TimToady> .oO(it would need a good * model for that)

[20:42] * tadzik is not really into this "I want everything in the browser" movement

[20:43] <TimToady> tell me you don't use emacs :)

[20:43] <sjohnson> a surprisingly high amount of people do use it

[20:43] <sjohnson> not me tho :)

[20:43] * sjohnson uses Vim

[20:44] <foodoo> I spare you the link to the appropriate XKCD Comic as you certainly all know it

[20:44] <moritz> we do.

[20:45] <tadzik> TimToady: no, I don't :) But I liked the tetris

[20:45] <IllvilJa> Well, you don't *need* to have your favorite language in the web browser, I'm surprised how competent Javascript turns out to be if you program it with enough discipline and thought.

[20:45] <sorear> I also don't think it's Android's job to have a ton of distinct language runtimes

[20:46] <TimToady> pugs had the beginning of a JS backend

[20:46] <foodoo> do the python people consider using parrot for Python4? If yes, then Android will support paarot for sure

[20:47] <sorear> why would they?

[20:47] <moritz> foodoo: is python 4 actually in planning?

[20:47] <moritz> it's the first time I've heard about it

[20:47] <foodoo> not that I know of. But if they switched to Parrot, they probably need another version number

[20:47] <sorear> TimToady: can you compile a typical 1kb Perl 6 program to <= 4kb of Javascript?

[20:48] <moritz> maybe if you gzip the javascript...

[20:48] <TimToady> no, but I'm not a p5-to-js translator

[20:48] <TimToady> *p6

[20:48] <frettled> TimToady: you're not that, either?  Sigh.  :D

[20:49] <TimToady> No, the only think I am right now is going to take a nap.

[20:49] <moritz> foodoo: there's a gsoc proposal to implement a python3 compiler for parrot. Let's see how far it gets

[20:49] <TimToady> &

[20:50] <moritz> sleep well

[20:50] <sorear> I suspect that if you proposed Parrot-today to Python, they'd laugh at you.  With good reason.

[20:50] <moritz> feedback on my latest spec change is very welcome

[20:50] <moritz> sorear: right

[20:51] <fglock> sorear: perlito.js is about 2.5 times the size of the Perl6 code

[20:52] <foodoo> Python3 is still rather young. Let's see how things develop until the end of the pre-python4-era ;)

[20:54] <sorear> moritz: it seems inconsistent to have %.payload for extensibility and at the same time be mixing in roles like OSError, why not use one or the other exclusively?

[20:55] <moritz> sorear: I was thinking the same towards the end... I probably should get rid of %.payload

[20:55] *** hudnix joined
[20:55] *** arcus left
[20:55] *** atrodo left
[20:55] <moritz> sorear: maybe the should be an X::AdHoc which has %.payload, for those too lazy to define their own classes

[20:56] <moritz> basically I want to stir people away from storing too much information in the message

[20:58] *** hercynium joined
[21:01] *** Lorn left
[21:02] <sorear> moritz: we could possibly use the enum/role coercion to benefit here

[21:02] <masak> moritz: a GSoC proposal -- but has it been accepted?

[21:03] <moritz> sorear: care to elaborate?

[21:03] <moritz> masak: yes

[21:03] <sorear> die $message but Errno::ENOENT

[21:03] <sorear> mixes in a role with an Errno method

[21:03] <moritz> sorear: then $message will still contain the name of the file inline

[21:03] <sorear> although, hmm, we want to mix in to the exception object

[21:03] <sorear> not to the message

[21:04] <moritz> aye

[21:04] <masak> moritz: wow, that's good news.

[21:04] <sorear> do you expect people to be using die $message, :arg<> a lot?

[21:04] <sorear> or some kind of X::Foo.new().throw?

[21:04] *** fglock left
[21:05] <sorear> I mean, do you expect &die to do most X:: construction?

[21:05] <moritz> sorear: I think those that bother to write their own error classes will either doe X::TheirError.new(...).throw or die X::TheirError.new()

[21:05] * masak will do the latter

[21:06] *** [Coke] left
[21:06] <moritz> sorear: and I want plain die() to be sufficiently flexible to create at least some X:: objects

[21:06] <masak> doing .throw on an exception object feels too magical :)

[21:06] <sorear> moritz: so &die does MMD DWIMmery on Str vs. X::Base?

[21:06] <moritz> yes

[21:06] <moritz> maybe die(Str, @rest of %arguments) creates an X::AdHoc, which has a %.payload etc.

[21:07] *** [Coke] joined
[21:08] <moritz> in unrelated news I've tried to understand the code in p5's FindBin.pm, and tried to simplify it

[21:08] <moritz> it's mindboggling, and partially very obscure, to say the least

[21:08] <moritz> it searches for the current script in $PATH even if it's in plain sight in the current directory

[21:09] <sorear> What happens if I pass an X::Base to &die which already has a $.backtrace?

[21:10] <moritz> sorear: haven't thought about that yet... it might stack the exceptions somehow

[21:10] <moritz> which we need for .fail() things anways

[21:10] <moritz> s/\.//

[21:11] <masak> $! is supposed to be a stack of exceptions, IIUC.

[21:12] <moritz> I wonder if X::Base simply should have a $.next attribute

[21:12] <moritz> so that it's a linked list of excpetions

[21:42] <alester> Then again, I imagine pmichaud could have mailed me. :-)

[21:43] <frettled> mail is SO 1990

[21:44] <tadzik> seems that I am mail

[21:44] *** MayDaniel joined
[21:44] *** ymasory left
[21:45] * moritz lectures tadzik about 'is' not being symmetrical

[21:45] <tadzik> well, right, but I couldn't resist the pun :)

[21:47] <masak> there are several meanings of 'is'. some, not all, symmetrical.

[21:47] <masak> the one frettled used is not.

[21:48] <sorear> dpm

[21:48] <sorear> don't you mean "transitive"?

[21:48] * masak hums "all I am sayin', give E-prime a chance"

[21:48] <masak> sorear: no, I think "symmetrical" was the proper term here.

[21:49] <masak> just because mail is SO 1990 does not mean that SO 1990 is mail.

[21:50] <sorear> How did we get from "SO 1990 is mail" to "[tadzik] am mail"

[21:50] <masak> oh, indeed.

[21:50] <masak> application of first symmetry, then transitivity? :)

[21:51] <masak> tadzik: as sorear implies, you also fail at syllogism.

[21:51] <tadzik> . o O ( say something stupid and it becomes a topic of a discussion. Similar to the zebras' case )

[21:51] <masak> so, for that matter, do I.

[21:51] <tadzik> bah, forget about it

[21:51] <masak> just because mail is 1990 does not mean that all things 1990 are mail.

[21:52] <masak> :P

[21:53] * masak likes syllogisms because they were the coolest thing around for hundreds of years until boolean logic was discovered

[21:53] <moritz> sorear: 'is' is indeed transitive, but not symmetrical

[21:54] <moritz> (in this context)

[21:55] <masak> right. because 'SO 1990' works as an attribute.

[21:56] <masak> ah. and here's the name of the fallacy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_undistributed_middle

[21:56] <masak> (Z := 'mail', B := '1990', Y := 'tadzik')

[21:58] <tadzik> pandas are so #perl6. #perl6 is so pandas

[21:59] <tadzik> take that, I'll read it in the morning ;)

[21:59] <frettled> :D

[21:59] <frettled> In British English, shouldn't it be "#perl6 are so pandas"?

[21:59] <masak> tadzik: sleep soundly, panda.

[22:00] <tadzik> frettled: that'd also help the symetry

[22:00] <masak> frettled: British English are very strange.

[22:00] <tadzik> and if not, I can adopt my Polish English for this to be correct

[22:00] <tadzik> use English '-Ofun';

[22:01] * masak .oO( apply some Polish... )

[22:01] <frettled> Tiger, tiger, burning bright

[22:01] <tadzik> alright, sleeping for real now :)

[22:03] <frettled> Oh, /me gruntlebuggit.

[22:04] <tadzik> hello again, greetings from sleeping disorders

[22:04] <frettled> sorear: that will make the language shine

[22:04] <masak> tadzik: try harder!

[22:04] <frettled> or softer

[22:04] <sorear> (mean 'you '(is 'tadzik 'mail))?

[22:04] <masak> sorear++

[22:04] <tadzik> masak: after 20 years of insomnia I can pretty much sense that in the nearest block of time I simply _won't_ sleep, no matter what

[22:05] <tadzik> last time this resulted in all-night cardinal hacking

[22:05] <masak> tadzik: have you heard about 90-minute sleep blocks?

[22:05] <tadzik> masak: I seem to recall something like this, yes

[22:05] <tadzik> the main blocker for me is that simply going to bed and closing my eyes won't get me to sleep

[22:06] <tadzik> my organism decides when to sleep, not me

[22:06] <huf> smoke weed

[22:06] <jasonmay> polyphasal sleep is probably impossible for people with REM-related sleeping problems

[22:06] <masak> huf: your choice of nick is suddenly all the clearer.

[22:06] <huf> huh?

[22:07] <huf> how is huf connected to that in any way?

[22:07] <tadzik> no, "huf"

[22:07] <tadzik> ;)

[22:07] <huf> (btw it's pronounced like hoof)

[22:07] <frettled> masak: seems rather foggy to me

[22:07] <masak> yeah, I must've been inhaling or something.

[22:08] <masak> won't happen again ;)

[22:08] <frettled> puff it all out

[22:08] <tadzik> poof, the magic dragon

[22:10] <frettled> This was a very fridayish conversation.

[22:10] <tadzik> and a bit nightish

[22:11] <frettled> I'll try that sleep thing now.  :)

[22:11] <frettled> G'night!

[22:11] <tadzik> g'night!

[22:11] <masak> on Fridays, the conversational topology is warped, so the shortest distance between supposition and conclusion is not a straight line.

[22:13] <masak> I'm having trouble executing a second REPL command in the new nqp (master branch).

[22:13] <masak> can anyone reproduce this?

[22:14] <masak> seems I'm on HEAD, too.

[22:17] <alester> everyone check your DNS for the new rakudo.org

[22:18] <tadzik> seems that is sent me to rakudoperl.org
