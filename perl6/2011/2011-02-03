[00:01] <masak> anyway, now we're one character closer to cracking your IRC password. and you're not nearly paranoid enough. :P

[00:02] <colomon> yes, but asking you to type a password and then reliably changing the focus to a public communications channel halfway through is a pretty massive flaw...

[00:02] <colomon> luckily I only use this password for IRC.

[00:02] <masak> duly noted.

[02:06] <thundergnat> The fact that unintialized $a *= 4 is equal to 4 is just bizarre... and it's spec too.

[02:06] <thundergnat> IMO that doesn't just _violate_ the priciple of least surprise, it violates it, beats it up, stabs it a few times and leaves it for dead in a drainage ditch.

[02:09] <colomon> heh

[02:11] <colomon> I have to admit, I'm starting to long for a "use really-strict" which doesn't let you use unintialized variables or automatically convert arrays to scalars.

[02:12] <colomon> he wanted 1/6 * [+] @list

[02:12] <colomon> without the *, it magically becomes 1/6 + @list.elems

[02:13] <thundergnat> Yeah, saw it in back log.

[02:13] <thundergnat> Makes sense after you think about it, but not real obvious.

[10:43] <sjohnson> probably cause it was larry's walls idea, and a lot of perl guys are excited about perl 6

[10:43] <xinming> sjohnson: Nope, Not because of lwall's idea.

[10:43] <moritz_> xinming: there are lots of discussions of the form "what makes perl perl?" on the internet; they also answer the question what makes Perl 6 perl

[10:44] <sjohnson> xinming: if you're so sure it's not his idea, why are you even asking

[10:44] <xinming> moritz_: What I can see is,  sub subname { }  construct.

[10:44] <xinming> I'll google a bit.

[10:44] <xinming> It seems, in perl 6 world, Everything can be changed.

[10:45] <tadzik> You know, just because you can it doesn't mean you should

[10:45] <moritz_> you can also change everything in perl 5

[10:45] <moritz_> so that part stayed the same :-)

[10:45] <tadzik> Also, I don't think Perl 5 is much different in thes case, see perl5i and MooSex::Declare

[10:45] <moritz_> or source filters

[10:46] <xinming> but perl is really different.

[10:46] <moritz_> which perl? different from what?

[10:46] <xinming> I try to learn python, and even though I read the tutorials, I found doing things in perl way makes me more confortable.

[10:46] <xinming> moritz_: I don't know, that's why I am asking.

[10:47] <tadzik> For it's more like a natural language, hence more natural to use once you get to know it. IMHO

[14:02] <uvtc> Hi. Where can I find the most recent Emacs and Vim support files for Perl 6?

[14:03] <masak> https://github.com/petdance/vim-perl

[14:04] <masak> for Emacs, I'd recommend cperl-mode. it's not perfect, but it's very robust so it handles even Perl 6 well.

[14:04] *** bluescreen left
[14:04] <uvtc> Thanks masak. Do you know if anyone's working on a separate Perl 6 Emacs mode?

[14:04] <masak> uvtc: for more tips, see http://perl6.org/whatever/

[14:05] *** stifynsemons joined
[14:05] *** timbunce joined
[14:05] <masak> uvtc: hm, no, not that I can recall.

[14:05] <daxim> upgrade to vim 7.3 to include the most recent vim-perl repo

[14:05] <uvtc> masak: Missed that. Thanks. :)

[14:05] <masak> uvtc: the underlying problem is that to parse Perl 6 really well, you have to *be* STD, or contain it.

[14:05] <masak> uvtc: and STD is written in Perl 6. you see the circularity there.

[14:07] <uvtc> I see. At the moment, just having syntax highlighting for things like comments and strings would be enough.

[14:07] <masak> uvtc: example: string parsing. simple deal, right? nope -- interpolations basically pull in the parser for the rest of the language. code blocks do the same. so it's no longer a simple matter of "find the first unescaped quote that looks like the start quote".

[14:08] <masak> so even string parsing is non-trivial.

[14:08] <uvtc> Ah.

[14:08] <masak> comments should be slightly easier, if you discount Pod.

[14:08] <moritz_> Pod isn't too hard to parse

[14:08] <uvtc> What does Perl 6 use for comments besides "#"?

[14:08] <masak> it is an open question how far/well you can actually fake all this without being STD.

[14:08] <masak> uvtc: see S26.

[14:09] <uvtc> masak: thanks.

[14:10] <masak> https://github.com/perl6/specs/raw/master/S26-documentation.pod

[14:11] <felliott> morning, perl6!

[14:11] <masak> felliott! \o/

[14:11] <felliott> I think i found a bogus test, and I'd like to confirm with you.

[14:11] <felliott> masak!

[14:12] <masak> go right ahead.

[14:12] *** mtk0 joined
[14:12] * masak had the urge the other day to do a writeup: "S26 and what we need to do about it"

[14:12] <felliott> rakudo: my $x = 42; @p = $x += 6, 7; @p[1].say;

[14:12] <p6eval> rakudo 2666b6: OUTPUT¬´===SORRY!===‚ê§Symbol '@p' not predeclared in <anonymous> (/tmp/MVNYt7d7Dn:22)‚ê§¬ª

[14:12] <felliott> rakudo: my $x = 42; my @p = $x += 6, 7; @p[1].say;

[14:12] <p6eval> rakudo 2666b6: OUTPUT¬´7‚ê§¬ª

[14:13] <felliott> That's correct, right?

[14:13] <moritz_> += is always item assignment

[14:13] <moritz_> so yes, I think it's correct

[14:13] <felliott> The test says it should be 47, but I think that was a typo.

[14:13] <felliott> I don't even know where 47 would come from

[14:14] <felliott> Cool, thanks!

[14:14] <moritz_> assign.t is a mess.

[14:14] <felliott> indeed

[14:15] <moritz_> one thing that could be done about it is splitting all list-vs-item-assignment tests into a separate file

[14:15] <moritz_> then it would still be messy, but the mess would be mostly factored out

[14:18] <masak> don't panic, or else :P

[14:18] <moritz_> :-)

[14:18] <uvtc> masak: re. S26, any idea why it's languishing? My impression is that much Perl 6 documentation is still being written in Perl 5 POD.

[14:18] <sjn> 0th step: don't be on fire

[14:20] <uvtc> masak: perhaps "languishing" is the wrong word.

[14:22] <masak> I think "languishing" captures it pretty well.

[14:22] *** patspam left
[14:22] <masak> there have been efforts to implement S26. some of them quite successful. none of them have ended up in Rakudo or some other compiler, for various reasons.

[14:23] <masak> I plan to give it a go at some point.

[14:23] <masak> one of the main problems has been pure parsing speed. mberends++ ran into some of those limits.

[14:24] <masak> TheDamian's module on CPAN is fairly fast, but it's in Perl 5, so that "doesn't count".

[14:24] <moritz_> and it's not up to date either

[14:24] <masak> that, too.

[14:24] <masak> to get the nice two-way integration required by S26, it has to be Perl 6 code in the compiler.

[14:24] <uvtc> Hm. I wouldn't think parsing speed would be an issue for rendering docs.

[14:25] <masak> welcome to the weird world of Perl 6.

[14:25] <uvtc> That is, I don't really mind waiting a moment after typing "perldoc foo".

[14:25] <masak> the future is already here, but it's coming to us through a greasy layer of s.l.o.w.

[14:25] <masak> uvtc: man, you have no idea.

[14:26] <masak> :)

[14:26] <masak> s/a moment/1e2 moments/

[14:26] <masak> speed: "hey, I can read the text as it scrolls by!"

[14:27] <uvtc> Hahaha. So, it's like hearing everything through a Cap't Kirk translator: "must ... render ... these ... docs into ... a man page!"

[14:27] <masak> *lol*

[14:27] <flussence> I get that with perl5 perldoc, but you've heard enough work horror stories from me for today :)

[14:28] <moritz_> somebody wants to apply https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/10 ? the patch looks fine to me, but I currently don't have access to a machine where I could commit it

[14:30] *** mtk0 left
[14:30] <uvtc> Does the `perl6` repl have any sort of built-in help system?

[14:35] <masak> at some point, maybe there'll be a way to get the Pod for a certain core method. it'd definitely be nice. but we're not there yet.

[14:36] * moritz_ wonders about good ways to document multis and their individual candidates

[14:36] <masak> a very good question. one S26 should address, but (in my recollection) doesn't.

[14:37] <masak> we need more application developers to stress-test S26! :)

[14:41] <uvtc> In the past, I've used my own made-up convention for marking API docs. Ex., starting the first line of the comment with "#/" or something.

[14:43] <masak> uvtc: we're still at the point where blue-skying of that kind -- especially presenting whole proposals of "nice-to-have" features, tooling, etc -- is very much welcome and appreciated.

[14:44] <masak> I, for one, would like to see a tool that took a .pm file (or a set of .pm files) as input, and output an .html file (or set of 'em) with impeccable API documentation.

[15:10] <[Coke]> masak: do you mean the normal TPF grant process, or hague?

[15:12] <masak> the Pod one would probably be a Hague grant, true.

[15:12] <masak> the Web.pm one is a TPF grant.

[15:12] <uvtc> Ah, interesting. Web.pm. I remember thinking "what about Web.pm" when I saw CGI-App on modules.perl6.org. Then just recently I saw tadzik blog about Bailador.

[15:12] <moritz_> Hague grant requires some non-zero degree of compiler hacking

[15:13] <masak> moritz_: well, see the grant application draft above.

[15:13] <moritz_> uvtc: I started porting CGI::App to Perl 6. It's runnable, but lacks things like integration with cookie module etc.

[15:13] <masak> uvtc: to a certain extent, other modules have flowed in where Web.pm meant to be but currently isn't. :/

[18:12] <ssps> the thing I hate most in Perl 5 is the need to decode and encode every textual string, that comes and goes out of program. is this issue solved in Perl 6?

[18:13] <moritz_> ssps: it's a fundamental problem in any programming system. Perl 6 "solves" it by assuming an autodetected Unicode encoding by default

[18:14] <moritz_> and it fixes the problem of accidentally mixing byte strings and text strings by packing them into (incompatiable) types

[18:14] <ssps> encoding of what? of input, of stored data or of output?

[18:15] <moritz_> well, $*IN, $*OUT and open() default to that

[18:16] <ssps> and which form this Unicode data really takes? 16-bits? UTF-8?

[18:27] <benabik> tadzik: I think it's referring to the fact that if you "use Net::SSH", IO.uri might start understanding scp:// URLs.

[18:28] <benabik> tadzik: Or "HTTP::Proxy" might override http:// URIs to hit a proxy first.

[18:34] <tadzik> so it would augment class IO and feed it with a multi uri($uri where { $uri ~~ /^^scp:/ }), aye?

[18:36] <benabik> If I'm reading it right, thats the purpose of the %*PROTOCOLS variable. `%*PROTOCOLS<scp> = SSH::Scp` and IO.uri will call `SSH::Scp.uri($uri)` when it gets a scp://

[20:15] <tadzik> if you want :) Otherwise I'll probably put it on my todo

[20:27] * ruoso was wishing javascript had coroutines...

[20:27] <Layla_91> tadzik: I need to download a file and keep getting disconnected every 20-30 minutes because of bad internet :( Do you know a good download manager that can resume if internet go down again?

[20:28] <flussence> you could try wget if you don't mind command line

[20:29] <flussence> wget -c $url; repeat until done

[20:29] <Layla_91> flussence: but if the network connection goes down again, will wget resume or restart?

[20:29] <tadzik> Layla_91: yeah, wget -c will continue

[20:31] <Layla_91> tadzik: wow.. I never noticed this option! hihi ^_^

[20:31] <flussence> you'll probably want --tries=0 --waitretry=5 too

[20:31] <benabik> curl -C - -O $url does the same thing.

[20:32] <benabik> Just for more options. :-)

[20:33] <flussence> yeah, but curl doesn't (apparently) have a way to say "retry indefinitely"...

[20:34] <mdxi> put it in a loop until it returns success?

[20:35] <flussence> --tries=0 is more OS-independent

[20:35] <Layla_91> flussence: it is ok if I retry manually as long as it continues where it was disconnected.. I am reading the man page.. I still not feel so sure the md5 of the file will be correct after 3-4 disconnections :D

[20:36] *** mtk left
[20:36] <flussence> it's TCP, so it *should* be safe from corruption in theory...

[20:36] <flussence> (crc32 every 1.5KB or so, iirc)

[20:36] * jnthn back

[20:37] <benabik> flussence: curl does have a --retries option, but I'm not 100% sure it plays nice with -C -

[20:37] <Layla_91> flussence: TCP is great... but it is wget that might not be perfect :)

[20:37] <Layla_91> jnthn: Prevet! ^_^

[20:37] <moritz_> Layla_91: in my experience wget does very well.

[20:37] <benabik> flussence: Sorry, --retry (details)

[20:38] <moritz_> it's a mature project

[20:38] <benabik> Layla_91: I've never had a problem with curl or wget saving bad data when interrupted.

[20:38] *** mtk joined
[20:38] <flussence> benabik: I know, but I checked the manpage and it doesn't have an equivalent to wget's 0 == Inf

[20:38] <benabik> flussence: 

[20:39] <Layla_91> moritz_: I will give it a try then =) 

[20:39] <benabik> flussence: True...  I like 0 meaning 0 myself.  ;-)  But you can set it to something silly like --retry 10000.  If 10k retries don't work, then you might want to figure out why.  :-D

[20:39] <flussence> heh :)

[20:42] <jnthn> Layla_91: Yeah, but I'm teaching all day long. So I only get to see the city by night. 

[20:43] <jnthn> lichtkind: Nah, I have to be disciplined this week. :P

[20:43] <Layla_91> flussence: so should I use: wget -c -tries=0 --waitretry=5 $url;

[20:43] <jnthn> The evenings are for preparing the next day's class, not beer. :(

[20:43] <lichtkind> jnthn: what is model6 is doing?

[20:44] <jnthn> lichtkind: Do you mean, what is it for? Or how is it going?

[20:45] <jnthn> lichtkind: If the first, I wrote a doc to try and explain that: https://github.com/jnthn/6model/blob/master/overview.pod :-)

[20:45] <lichtkind> the ladder, some minimal investigation from my side you can presume

[20:45] <jnthn> lichtkind: Going well overall. Next week I start to get Rakudo to use it. Will be in a branch.

[20:46] <Layla_91> jnthn: mmm.. teaching is a little hard I think O_o.. but still .. stockholm! :D I do not like beer a lot.. I prefer eating Chocolates! :P

[20:46] <Tene> lichtkind: http://6guts.wordpress.com/ is a good place to follow jnthn's progress

[20:46] <Tene> if you want more detail than that, the commit log is pretty enlightening

[20:47] <jnthn> Layla_91: Yes, it's very tiring. But my students are lovely. :)

[20:47] <jnthn> Layla_91: You'd love the place I'm teaching. There's lots of chocolates around. ;-)

[20:48] <lichtkind> Tene: thanks a lot

[20:48] <Tene> lichtkind: thank jnthn++

[21:17] <masak> the 'Net is fantastic. for the first time in the history of mankind, we can self-select communities.

[21:17] <masak> (rather than finding us in one, geographically)

[21:19] *** bluescreen left
[21:19] <Layla_91> masak: that is bad too.. people became too selective instead of being adaptive.. (or maybe it is good? :S)

[21:19] *** bluescreen joined
[21:21] *** loveaboy left
[21:21] <masak> Layla_91: a little bit of both, I guess. the option to leave when people are being destructive is easier when geography is not involved.

[21:22] <masak> and so the people who stick around are likely to be the ones who care.

[21:23] <moritz_> if I were to only meet the p6 hackers in 50km distance or less, I'd be pretty lonely with my hacking hobby

[21:23] <mberends> internetters need to be more selective now that everyone can shout with global scale megaphones.

[21:23] <Tene> masak: Have you seen Eliezer's "Evaporative cooling of online communities" extended metaphor?

[21:24] <masak> Tene: no, haven't dug into Eliezer beyond MoR yet.

[21:26] <Tene> "It's the articulate trolls that you should be wary of ejecting, on this theory - they serve the hidden function of legitimizing less extreme disagreements."

[21:27] <masak> interesting.
