[01:20] <On96> foreach my $name ( $query ->param ) {my @val = $query ->param( $name );foreach ( @val ) {$_ = Encode::decode_utf8( $_ );} $name = Encode::decode_utf8( $name ); :-) 

[01:20] <On96> simply decoding and encoding at the right places...

[01:21] <On96> UTF-8 is working!

[01:24] <sorear> I recommend not putting spaces before ->

[01:24] <sorear> Spaces before postfix operators break in Perl 6

[01:26] <sorear> according to perldoc CGI, you should just be able to use CGI '-utf8'; and have it all automatic

[01:27] <flussence_> the best way to handle utf8 is pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're the one doing IO

[09:02] <masak> On96: no, that doesn't sound like great crime at all.

[09:03] <masak> sounds like what you'd want to do in general with the I/O barrier and strings.

[09:03] <masak> on the "inside" of your application, you want to treat the strings are sequences of characters. on the "outside", you generally have to treat them as sequences of bytes.

[09:04] <masak> which means what you generally do is decode, process, encode.

[09:30] <masak> ah. S03 mentions just that: "Note that list associativity (X) only works between identical operators. If two different list-associative operators have the same precedence, they are assumed to be non-associative with respect to each other, and parentheses must be used to disambiguate."

[10:03] <masak> also, the last couple chapters have been, well. not worse in quality, but also not building on the main story.

[10:05] <moritz_> considering that it's a fan fiction of philospher's stone, there needs to be some motivation to go into that forbidden corridor

[10:05] <moritz_> so the last chapter might be the builtup for that

[10:05] <moritz_> but yes, so far it looks like a side story

[10:07] <masak> oh, true. it's not that I mind the extra focus on Hermione; she already has a pretty large part in the story, so it makes sense.

[10:07] <masak> and leading up to the forbidden corridor would indeed explain the detour.

[17:23] <colomon> It's an annoying CAD format.

[17:23] <colomon> They made it simple and elegant, and then heaped on about four layers of compression stuff on top of everything.

[17:27] <colomon> poop, graphviz won't install on my OS X.  :(

[17:36] <masak> colomon: might be you can use this nice tool: https://github.com/masak/tote/commit/033fcfb506d1f61fe2c35c5064ca6f3fd2923730

[17:42] <masak> flussence_: I think I've seen graphviz graphs with far more nodes than that...

[17:42] <sorear> flussence_: once I tried to render the static call graph of a 1MB executable using graphviz

[17:43] <flussence_> (which is on a tmpfs, so it probably ran out of RAM)

[17:43] <sorear> it generated a .svg with a nominal size of 10^6 by 10^3

[17:43] <sorear> that was about 30,000 edges iirc

[20:48] <arnsholt> Easter is the traditional "go to the mountains for cross-country skiing"-holiday =)

[20:49] <lue> Easter is when this year?

[20:49] <arnsholt> Stupid late

[20:49] <arnsholt> Last week-end of march, IIRC

[20:52] <mberends> Easter Sunday will be April 24

[20:56] <arnsholt> Heh. Shows how good my memory is

[20:57] <mberends> coincidentally Orthodox Easter is also on the same date, unlike in most other years http://christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/qt/whyeasterchange.htm
