[11:43] <dalek> niecza: Nth draft of a program to generate compact binary UCD dumps

[11:43] <dalek> niecza: review: https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/18f7db0598

[11:44] <sorear> output files for the full 6.0.0 UCD are ~600kb, smaller than STD.dll but not as small as I'd like

[11:45] <sorear> 1/6 size of original XML;  232k gzip

[11:45] <sorear> curiously the output actually compresses _better_ (by 1%) with gizp than bzip2.  xz still wins out by a large margin (139k)

[11:47] <sorear> oh, read the wrong number for the first one, actually 483k uncompressed

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: 506177f | moritz++ | src/ops/nqp_bigint.ops:

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: make nqp::isbig_I consistent with set_int and get_int

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: 

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: turns out that set_int and get_int only support 32bit, even on 64bit

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: platforms. While the better fix would be to make them work on 64 bit width,

[13:43] *** clairvy left
[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: this approach change nqp::isbig_i to return 1 if the stored int takes more

[13:43] <dalek> nqp/bigint: than 32bit.

[18:20] <moritz> could somebody on a 32bit machine please build latest nqp branch bigint run this script: https://gist.github.com/1362443 and paste the output for me?

[18:57] <japhb> moritz, have you had any takers yet?

[18:58] *** simcop2387 joined
[18:59] <japhb> I'll give it a try anyway, I've got a 32-bit box here ... it will just take a while to build.

[19:15] *** mberends joined
[19:17] <moritz> no takers yet

[19:17] <japhb> Incoming

[19:17] <japhb> Er, supposedly.

[19:17] <tadzik> no 32bits here :/

[19:17] <japhb> Hmmm.  Appears nopaste does not like me today

[19:18] <japhb> Ah, could only paste into MAGnet.

[19:18] *** fsergot left
[19:18] <japhb> moritz, the paste should be on #parrot now.

[19:20] <moritz> japhb: thanks. Can you please also change $i to 28 (instead of 30) and paste the first 6 lines of the output then? 

[19:27] *** cooper left
[19:27] <japhb> moritz, sorry, got pulled away for a bit

[19:27] <japhb> OK, will do.

[19:29] *** wolfman2000 left
[19:30] <japhb> moritz, OK, paste (of full output, sorry, it's easiest) is in #parrot

[19:30] <moritz> japhb: thanks again

[19:30] <japhb> moritz, np, hope it helps

[19:31] <moritz> japhb: it does. Unfortunately it tells me that my latest patch is broken on 32bit :/

[19:31] <japhb> Oh dear.

[19:31] <japhb> Ah, wait.

[19:31] <japhb> May not be your fault.

[19:32] <japhb> I built from rakudo, and it pulled nqp.  May not have gotten latest.

[19:32] <japhb> Hold on

[19:33] <moritz> the 1 is the output from nqp::isbig_I 

[19:34] <moritz> which checks if an integer is too large to unbox to a parrot INTVAL

[19:34] <moritz> when it returns 1 even if it shouldn't then it makes the codgen inefficient

[19:35] <moritz> when it returns 0 even if it shouldn't then we lose precision

[19:35] <japhb> :-(

[19:35] * japhb is rebuilding NQP

[19:36] <japhb> Ughh, I hate building on slow hardware

[19:36] <tadzik> (don't listen to this, dear laptop! You aren't slow, I hate building anyway)

[19:41] *** Moukeddar joined
[19:42] *** fsergot joined
[19:42] <japhb> BTW, that build didn't work: trying again with a fresh configure and --gen-parrot, just in case something's hinky here

[19:43] *** wk joined
[19:53] <japhb> OK, after all that: no change, sorry moritz.

[19:54] <japhb> moritz, anything else you want me to try?

[19:57] *** Kivutarrr left
[19:59] * moritz is out of ideas for the moment

[20:02] *** MayDaniel left
[20:04] <snearch> Hi moritz, just ran your test on 32 Bit http://nopaste.info/f77fe95f71.html

[20:04] *** anazawa joined
[20:05] <moritz> snearch: thanks

[20:07] * moritz swears loudly

[20:09] <diakopter> btw, latest parrot regresses on parrot-nqp; after 3.9.0 there was a change that made parrot-nqp generate wrong pir for the *.pm in nqplua/nqpclr

[20:09] <diakopter> I didn't bother reporting it to #parrot since all my other bug reports have gone ignored

[20:14] *** ksi joined
[20:18] <benabik> diakopter: Wrong how?

[20:19] <diakopter> I got a "could not call method on variable because it's Undef

[20:19] <diakopter> "

[20:19] <diakopter> or something like that

[20:19] <diakopter> downgrading to 3.6.0 (package in ubuntu) fixed it

[20:19] <benabik> Between 3.6 and 3.9, then?

[20:20] <diakopter> or after 3.9

[20:20] <diakopter> I've used 3.9 on windows and it didn't have the problem

[20:20] <diakopter> I was using parrot Head

[20:20] <diakopter> on ubuntu

[20:20] <diakopter> before downgrading to 3.6.0

[20:21] <benabik> So probably 3.9+, but possibly anywhere since 3.6.  Fun.

[20:21] <benabik> Where is nqplua?

[20:21] <diakopter> diakopter/6model.git

[20:22] <benabik> diakopter: I've got a bit of spare time between studying, I'll see what I can track down.

[20:22] <diakopter> I'll see if I can reproduce it with 3.9 on ubuntu

[20:27] <diakopter> 3.9.0 (built from source) didn't have the problem

[20:28] <diakopter> sigh. now I can't reproduce it with the same parrot checkout I had the problem with earlier.

[20:28] <benabik> :-(
