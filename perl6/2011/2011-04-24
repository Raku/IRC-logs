[21:48] <jnthn> moritz: I merged ctmo into match-nom 

[21:48] <jnthn> Then hacked

[21:48] <jnthn> Then made match-nom work

[21:48] <jnthn> Then wanted the work in ctmo 

[21:48] <jnthn> the match-nom branch can be deleted now since the work in it is done and incorporated into ctmo.

[21:49] <jnthn> With the GC fixes above, using Match done with 6model seems stable. :)

[21:50] <jnthn> In fact, it was pretty stable before, given it took until today for the above GC issue to cause a segfault and make me go hunting. :)

[21:50] <jnthn> It was probabalistic at the command line, but thankfully determinate under the debugger.

[21:51] <jnthn> Hmm...or so I hoped...

[21:53] <jnthn> Dang. Another SEGV.

[21:57] <moritz> jnthn: did you notice any speed difference?

[21:57] <lue> hello world! o/

[21:58] <jnthn> moritz: It's about the same.

[21:58] <jnthn> moritz: We've introduced some extra overhead that still isn't optimized away.

[21:58] <jnthn> moritz: I suspect the actual object operations are cheaper.

[21:59] <jnthn> moritz: But a few things that were Parrot v-table calls to C before are full-blown calls now.

[21:59] <jnthn> And they use lexicals that could be optimized to simple register usage at some point.

[21:59] <jnthn> OTOH, the memory usage should be lighter.

[22:00] <jnthn> Since every match is automatically a PMC lighter just from not having the Parrot Object overhead of 2 PMCs.

[22:00] <moritz> I guess GMS has eliminated some of the pain of having more PMCs

[22:01] <jnthn> But also we have a couple of PMCs per Match less.

[22:01] <jnthn> (for $!to and $!from)

[22:01] <jnthn> The speed pain, yes. 

[22:01] <jnthn> But Match objects live a long time.

[22:01] <jnthn> So we've shrunk the size of the match tree that we keep in memory.

[22:03] * moritz really hopes that all those PAST nodes are eventually GCed too
