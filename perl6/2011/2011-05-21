[15:01] <tadzik> hi ruoso 

[15:01] <ruoso> I'm trying to get back to normal routine... 3 months since I moved to NYC

[15:02] <sorear> have you played with 6model?

[15:02] *** mj41 joined
[15:03] <ruoso> nope... what is it?

[15:04] *** leprevost joined
[15:04] <sorear> it's a new framework for nqp/rakudo which is highly based on smop

[15:04] *** silug joined
[15:05] <ruoso> really??? that's awesome

[15:06] <ruoso> where can I read more about it?

[15:06] <TimToady> latest blog is http://6guts.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/rakudo-on-6model-gets-underway/

[15:07] * ruoso feel very happy that smop experiments got to such an important outcome

[15:08] <sorear> TimToady: is STD correct to reject spaces in :16<abc * 10 ** 3> ?

[15:09] <TimToady> it seems like a needless stricture

[15:10] <sorear> Does the ** form imply Num, like 123e0 does?

[16:06] <jnthn> :)

[16:07] <jnthn> It's nice to be home again, though I already miss Russia a bit ;)

[16:08] <ruoso> but you know what a very interesting experiment would be?

[16:08] <ruoso> porting 6model to p5guts

[16:09] <tadzik> . o O ( 6moose )

[16:09] <ruoso> not moose, but using SV* as a representation

[16:09] <jnthn> ruoso: :)

[16:10] <ruoso> jnthn++ while 1;

[16:10] <ruoso> and if NQP is bootstrapping, it would mean we would be able to run it in p5 alone

[16:11] <ruoso> that would be very very interesting

[16:11] <tadzik> oh, I see

[16:11] <jnthn> ruoso: My more immediate goal was "get it to spit itself out on the CLR" but yes, if somebody wants to do Perl 5, nice. :)

[18:15] <woldrich> masak, hi. are you going to npw by train?

[18:17] <jnthn> Actually, as the organizers, we plan to show up every day in a stretch limo...

[18:17] <masak> one each.

[18:18] <woldrich> jnthn, oh, right.

[18:18] <jnthn> My limo will be so cool it'll have a built-in sauna.

[18:18] <masak> woldrich: but technically, I will. since I live 10 minutes away from the venue by train. :)

[18:18] <jnthn> oh, wait...

[18:18] <jnthn> :)

[18:18] <woldrich> masak, oh, I thought you lived in uppsala

[18:19] <masak> woldrich: I did, until I got my new job in southern Sweden.

[19:04] <masak> at the YAPC::Russia hackathon, I talked to a person who was worried that sigils in Perl might doom it to forever be a scripting language.

[19:05] <masak> I listed what I considered to be some of the advantages of sigils -- namespacing, interpolation, separation of "nouns" from "verbs" -- but I felt there was an underlying issue that I couldn't express.

[19:05] <tadzik> I don't quite get the idea

[19:06] <masak> something about the "scriptiness" not residing in the sigils.

[19:06] <tadzik> the lack of sigils doesn't make lua any less scripting

[19:06] <masak> or Ruby.

[19:07] *** MayDaniel joined
[19:07] <masak> I agree that many people will mistakenly *think* there is a connection between sigils and scriptiness.

[19:07] <masak> bash and PHP, I guess, provide some guilt by association. :)

[19:07] <tadzik> masak: I like the manifesto

[19:07] <masak> (as do many uses of Perl itself, of course)

[19:08] <masak> tadzik: oh, I haven't published it yet. still waiting for jnthn's approval.

[19:28] <jnthn> moritz: Of course I know about that. I implemented it.

[19:29] <jnthn> moritz: I don't think it really weakens the argument.

[19:29] <masak`> moritz: if so, I don't see how that is a counter-argument to any of the three arguments in the gist.

[19:29] *** birdwindupbird joined
[19:29] <masak`> the actual parameter names are still just as exposed.

[19:29] <moritz> right

[19:29] <jnthn> masak`: It helps in so far as it gives you a way to introduce a new name and keep the old one available.

[19:29] <masak`> and when they change in the module, code in the caller will break just as much.

[19:29] <moritz> fwiw I'm of two minds about it

[19:30] <jnthn> masak`: But that relies on people being aware of the need to do that.

[19:30] <jnthn> Which I'm not at all certain will be the case.

[19:30] <masak`> right.

[19:30] <moritz> another argument against the feature is that it's easy to accidently create ambiguous dispatch

[19:30] <moritz> see my last commit to roast

[19:30] <jnthn> It's sometimes OK to surprise people when there's a notable win.

[19:31] <masak`> to spell it out, the *danger* here is when people go "ooh, a better name for my positional parameter. (good thing that doesn't break the API.)"

[19:31] <jnthn> But in this case it's surprising and the win seems very small.

[19:31] <moritz> OTOH I like $thing.split('foo', :limit(3))

[19:31] <masak`> then maybe it should be a named parameter :)
