[08:26] <agentzh> hey, it's fun to see the smartlinks in the pugs test suite are getting fewer and fewer. :)

[08:26] <lambdabot> agentzh: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[08:28] <anatolyv> agentzh: is that a good or a bad thing?

[08:29] <agentzh> oops, sorry, my mistake. :P

[08:29] <agentzh> pugs has got many more smartlinks... :)

[08:29] <agentzh> forgot to specify "t/*/*/*.t" :)

[08:30] <anatolyv> :)

[08:30] <agentzh> two months ago, smartlinks.pl reported "453 smartlinks found and 50 broken"

[08:30] <agentzh> now it says "639 smartlinks found and 9 broken"

[08:31] <agentzh> the pugs team has done a very job. :)

[08:31] <agentzh> *very good

[08:34] * agentzh tries to add damian's S26 to feather...

[08:35] <agentzh> given that S26 is written in perl 6 POD, it may crash my smartlinks.pl horribly. :)

[08:36] <agentzh> actually the latest S04 already breaks smartlinks.pl on feather.

[08:36] <agentzh> alas...

[08:37] <anatolyv> with perl6 POD stuff?

[08:37] <agentzh> S04 is in perl 5 POD syntax, i think. it just has some syntax error in it.

[08:38] <agentzh> S26 is in perl 6 POD syntax.

[08:38] <agentzh> i'm looking forward to damian's perl 6 POD parser.

[08:38] <agentzh> has it been released to CPAN yet?

[08:38] <anatolyv> I don't think so, according to damian's latest in p6l.

[08:39] <agentzh> okay, thanks. :)

[08:47] <agentzh> oh no, svn.pugs.org is down...

[08:47] <agentzh> (it seems to me)

[08:49] <agentzh> anyone here has access to svn.pugs.org?

[15:54] <gaal> [OT] was there a trick to write reusavle Perl 5 comparators in a module? (that didn't involve caller()...)

[15:55] <gaal> *reusable

[16:04] * Debolaz suspects gaal may be Elmer Fudd.

[16:04] <gaal> wouldn't I have to pronounce it "weusawulle" if I were?

[16:07] <eviltwin_b> b/v confusion is more like hispanic than elmer fudd :)

[16:11] *** sweinig is now known as sweinig|away

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> gaal - not sure I understand what you mean

[16:16] <gaal> Limbic_Region: say I write a custom sort function e.g. to sort OIDs

[16:16] <gaal> In Perl 5, this uses the magic $a and $b globals

[16:16] <gaal> however these globals are not forced to package main:: like some other magicals are

[16:16] <gaal> This means that I have to put my comparator function in the same module as its user

[16:17] <gaal> (or hardcode the user's namespace into the comparator, or divine it with caller)

[16:17] <gaal> I don't like any of these options :)

[16:17] <gaal> One excellent solution is "write it in Perl 6 with placeholders!"

[16:17] <Limbic_Region> I am still not clear but I know List::Util allows users to define stuff with $a and $b

[16:18] <gaal> except that that doesn't moos in my production environment.

[16:18] <gaal> *moose. moose moose moose

[16:18] <gaal> what stuff?

[16:18] *** chris2_ joined
[16:18] <Limbic_Region> gaal - like your reduce block

[16:19] <gaal> local(*{$caller."::a"}) = \my $a;

[16:20] *** chris2_ is now known as chris2

[16:20] <Limbic_Region> but now I understand what you mean

[16:20] <gaal> I want implicit parameters.

[16:20] <Limbic_Region> right

[16:21] <Limbic_Region> well, without source filters or templating, I don't know of a way

[16:21] <gaal> OK thanks.

[16:21] <Limbic_Region> that isn't to say there isn't one - just that I don't know of one

[16:28] <Debolaz> I notice when building pugs that it says ghc 6.4.2 produces a slower pugs than ghc 6.6, how much performance increase does ghc 6.6 give pugs?

[16:31] <Limbic_Region> Debolaz - it varies with platform but it is significant

[16:31] <Limbic_Region> very significant

[16:31] <Limbic_Region> further more, the next point release of Pugs will require 6.6 at a minimum

[16:32] <Debolaz> Hrmm.. neither portage, pkgsrc or ports has ghc 6.6 :/

[16:33] * Debolaz is building it manually atm.

[16:33] <eviltwin_b> but if you use haskell for anything other than pugs, you might want to keep 6.4 around --- seems to be a lot of stuff hat doesn't work with 6.6 yet

[16:34] <Debolaz> Not other than trying out darcs.

[16:35] <Limbic_Region> well, keeping multiple branches around is easy

[16:38] <Debolaz> Why will it require ghc 6.6 though? Not complaining about this, just curious.

[16:52] *** jferrero joined
[16:59] <merlyn> cpan Perl6::Pugs is failing with ghc 6.6 - is this expected?

[16:59] <merlyn> do I need to go to the SVN to get something I can install today?

[17:02] <wolverian> in general, svn is a good idea.

[17:03] <wolverian> however, I don't think that's expected.

[17:08] *** markstos joined
[17:09] <Limbic_Region> Debolaz - there are features that Pugs will be using for its object model that are only available in 6.6

[17:10] <Limbic_Region> Debolaz - and the next projected point release for pugs is 6.28 (objects)

[19:00] <Limbic_Region> things are pretty slow ATM

[19:01] <diotalevi_> Yes, pretty much.

[19:02] <diotalevi_> Reinstalling emacs and I wanted to validate that p5's smartmatch had the same tests as p6's.

[19:03] <diotalevi_> It was an idle thought anyway.

[19:05] <Limbic_Region> is p5's smartmatch as advanced as p6's?

[19:05] <diotalevi_> Nope.

[19:06] <diotalevi_> But I got the idea that it might be wrongish.

[19:06] <diotalevi_> That's how I recalled it.

[19:06] <pmurias> smatmatch is ~= in perl5

[19:07] <pmurias> that is =~

[19:07] <diotalevi_> No, ~~.

[19:08] <diotalevi_> =~/!~ in p5 is just plain old regexp matching.

[19:08] <diotalevi_> ~~ in 5.9.wibble+ is akin to p6's smartmatch.

[19:10] <diotalevi_> See 'Smart matching in detail' in http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/perl-current/pod/perlsyn.pod.
