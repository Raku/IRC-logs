[05:21] <root4o> hi

[05:24] <root4o> I watched this :http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=448441135356213813&q=engEDU+lisp  

[05:24] <root4o> and was wondering does Perl6 allow  double/triple/etc i.e. multi-level-dispatch as discribed here..... or it just normal-multimethod dispatch ala advanced-java ?

[05:24] <lambdabot> Title: Practical Common Lisp - Google Video, http://tinyurl.com/y7pe72

[05:27] <root4o> FYI : searching for "engEDU" in video.google.com shows many very interesting conferences on different topics....

[05:45] <TimToady> root4o: it can do either depending on where you put semicolons instead of commas.

[16:36] <TimToady> Limbic_Region: interesting.  I note that the problem itself doesn't say the numbers have to be contiguous, though the example seems to indicate it.

[16:37] <TimToady> there are many sets of 4 numbers on the same straight line that aren't in one of the 8 cardinal directions

[16:43] <TimToady> actually, it limits it to vertical, horizontal, and diagonal, but the continguity is still somewhat implied by the example.

[16:43] <TimToady> anyway, I'll whack on the P6 version...

[16:44] *** kevinG joined
[16:54] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - sorry, was AFK

[16:54] <TimToady> np

[16:54] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - Project Euler is full of fun 5 minute distractions

[16:55] <Limbic_Region> I hadn't thought of it as a way practicing Perl 6

[16:55] <Limbic_Region> but since blazar asked I thought I should share with the channel

[16:55] <Limbic_Region> fwiw, blazar is in the hospital with an extremely rare form of cancer

[16:55] <TimToady> Looks like a good way of showing off Perl 6.  I just wish XX was implemented...

[16:56] <TimToady> yow

[17:01] *** spoop joined
[17:02] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - if I am reading S03 correctly, xx in p5 is ('foo') x $some_num;

[17:02] <Limbic_Region> ?

[17:04] *** lisppaste3 joined
[17:05] <TimToady> the X*X cross product metaoperator

[17:06] <TimToady> X and XX are just common shortcuts

[17:06] <Limbic_Region> oh, neat

[17:07] <TimToady> but maybe it's not needed here, since the first line wants to [...] each 4 nums.

[17:07] <TimToady> but I'm sure we can hyper some things.

[17:07] <Limbic_Region> where is XX discussed as a cross product metaoperator?

[17:08] <Limbic_Region> I see it under metaoperators in S03

[17:08] <TimToady> S03:1708

[17:09] <Limbic_Region> ah, didn't look far enough down

[17:10] <TimToady> he doesn't realize there's a min operator and [min] either...

[17:24] <Gothmog_> Limbic_Region: I don't think I found the problem you're talking about, though I'm pretty interested... could you tell me the name of the problem?

[17:28] <Limbic_Region> according to blazar's use.perl journal entry (not PerlMonks node) it is problem 14

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> er um

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> scratch that

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> he has apparently written about 2 different problems

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> the one in his use.perl journal is 14

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> the one in the perlmonks node is 11

[17:30] <Gothmog_> So it is about "Up Down Left Right" and "Four Fours"?

[17:32] * Limbic_Region is trying to remember his password

[17:32] <Limbic_Region> I haven't done project euler in a long time

[17:33] <Limbic_Region> Problem 11's description is In the 2020 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.

[17:35] <Limbic_Region> my genious rating has dropped a fair amount as a result of not keeping up with new problems

[17:36] <Gothmog_> Ah, I see it now... if you aren't logged in and enter 11 in the quick search you get another problem.

[17:36] <TimToady> you can click the problem list on the left and get to 11

[17:38] <Gothmog_> Ah, that works, too..

[17:38] <Limbic_Region> one of those problems lead me to write Partition::Integer::Unrestricted which I still need to upload to CPAN

[17:38] <pasteling> "TimToady" at 71.139.39.243 pasted "a preliminary pugs-compatible solution" (32 lines, 1.5K) at http://sial.org/pbot/21546

[17:38] <Gothmog_> Strange that the search finds another problem with ID 11.

[17:39] <TimToady> my solution uses max instead of the unimplemented [max], and prints in E notation, albeit with sufficient precision.

[17:40] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - are you planning on replying?

[17:40] <TimToady> also haven't thought about hyperizing yet, but I'm being dragged out for a walk by my health advisor.  :)

[17:40] <TimToady> yes, but not immediately.

[17:41] <TimToady> maybe I'll just put up my prelim version now.

[17:41] <Limbic_Region> heh, tell Gloria we said hi

[19:32] <wolverian> oh. linear offsets

[19:39] <wolverian> heh. my haskell solution is 15 lines and gives the wrong answer. :)

[19:46] <Gothmog_> wolverian: @dir is the direction... but I think, 22 is not correct there...

[19:48] <wolverian> hrm. shouldn't it be 19 and 21?

[19:48] <wolverian> anyway. I'm not using that method :)

[19:50] <Gothmog_> Yes, I think so...

[19:52] <Gothmog_> But it gives the same result, whether you enter 22, 19 or neither.

[19:55] <wolverian> yay, my program now gives the same answer.

[19:56] <wolverian> it's not very pretty, though. :)

[20:01] <lisppaste3> wolverian pasted "Solution to #11" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/31238

[20:11] <Gothmog_> Ah no, we were wrong. 22 is correct.

[20:12] <Gothmog_> He adds a 0 after every line, so each line has 21 entries...

[20:12] <wolverian> Gothmog_, ah. thanks.

[21:59] <TimToady> the last statement now reads:

[21:59] <TimToady> }

[22:00] <TimToady> the hyperop is actually bogus according to current specs though...

[22:00] <TimToady> should be «+« instead.

[22:06] *** lisppaste3 joined
[22:12] <Gothmog_> Very nice. But I think I have to correct you: the version of XX I wrote should really work for an arbitrary count of arguments...

[22:12] <Gothmog_> @a XX @b XX @c ... should work, too.

[22:12] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: all-dicts arr ask . v

[22:16] <Gothmog_> I don't really know what pugs does with it, but I suppose it's either left or right associative...
