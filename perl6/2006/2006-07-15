[00:30] <nothingmuch> i'm actually installing orz

[00:30] <nothingmuch> to use it

[00:32] <clkao> nothingmuch: so where's the rest of your music

[00:32] <nothingmuch> on my laptop

[00:32] <nothingmuch> i can rsync it to my  box when i get home

[00:32] <nothingmuch> or i can push specific parts to you over the next hour or so

[00:32] <nothingmuch> till boarding

[00:33] <clkao> orz

[00:33] <clkao> i will wait till you get home

[00:33] <clkao> have a safe flight

[00:38] <TimToady> nothingmuch: I've updated S03--so tell me if there's something there that I should clarify.

[00:40] <nothingmuch> TimToady: i just started reading the patches

[00:40] <nothingmuch> but a certain someone is a constant distraction

[00:40] <TimToady> it's pretty much what we discussed.

[00:40] <nothingmuch> yes, i looked over it

[00:40] <nothingmuch> and the first pragraph of each one is very clear

[00:40] <nothingmuch> the exact details are what i haven't looked at yet

[00:40] <TimToady> pity about the rest.. :)

[00:40] <nothingmuch> so i may have nitty feedback

[00:40] <nothingmuch> heh

[00:41] <TimToady> k

[00:41] <TimToady> there's always nits...

[00:48] *** marcus_ joined
[00:50] <TreyHarris> TimToady: just a crazy idea.  one of the things programmers from other languages have to get used to is that Perl's boolean operators return values other than just true and false.  since in Perl 6, we can give any object a true or a false role, should the comparison and relational operators now return values as well?

[00:59] <TimToady> ?eval 1 == 1

[00:59] *** evalbot_11535 is now known as evalbot_11550

[00:59] <evalbot_11550> Bool::True

[00:59] <TimToady> not such a crazy idea

[01:00] <TimToady> ?eval (1 == 1) + 42

[01:00] <evalbot_11550> 43.0

[01:01] <TimToady> or are you asking for Icon's semantics?

[01:01] <TimToady> I don't like those...

[01:13] <TreyHarris> TimToady: sorry, lost my connection for a bit.  I'm not familiar with Icon's semantics, what are they?  I was thinking more that "3 < 4" should return "4 but true", "3 > 4" should return "3 but false"

[01:13] <TreyHarris> s/should/might/ # i'm still just thinking out loud

[01:15] <TimToady> yeah, that's Icon's semantics...

[01:15] <TimToady> except they call it "success" rather than truth.

[01:16] <TreyHarris> ok, since you've thought about it and made a determination, i'll rest easy :-)

[01:17] <TimToady> it might well even work that way underneath, by my experience with Icon tells me it's a lousy thing to try to get newbies to understand.

[01:17] <TimToady> s/by/but/

[01:18] <TimToady> me having been a newbie once trying to understand Icon...

[01:18] *** dduncan joined
[01:18] <TreyHarris> true, but it's a lousy thing to get Perl newbies (who are, say, C++ programmers) to understand a simple thing like "$a = $b || $c".  just today somebody on my company's perl list posited that that should always be turned into a ternary or an if/else because it's too difficult to understand "even for experienced developers"....

[01:19] <TreyHarris> but I think that's just C bias showing

[01:19] <TimToady> Yeah, we use "or" to return things other than booleans all the time in English.

[01:20] <TimToady> but most of us don't use < to return $b but true

[01:21] <dduncan> I don't know if others are doing this, but starting now I will be maintaining a separate clean-room style install of Perl on my machine whose only purpose is to support v6.pm ... it will be the latest stable Perl (5.8.x) plus the latest CPAN releases of v6.pm and the latest CPAN releases of all of its dependency chain ... and nothing else ... only what is released on CPAN will go in it ...

[01:21] <nothingmuch> boarding time soon

[01:22] <TreyHarris> yes.  I have difficulty understanding sentences like "'if (! $d)' is much easier to understand than 'unless $d'"....  I suspect a certain degree of disingenousness when I hear that.

[01:22] <dduncan> parallel to the SVN of Pugs, this will be the "Perl 6" for my development

[01:23] <dduncan> that collection will be the Perl 6 analogue of a plain Perl 5 install

[01:23] <nothingmuch> TimToady: maybe a comment on why strings are really objects but pretend to be values is important

[01:23] <TimToady> hmm.

[01:23] <nothingmuch> the whole character <-> encoding thing shouldn't be explained in line

[01:23] <dduncan> since v6.pm et al are released to CPAN now frequently, it should be fairly up to date with development at any given time

[01:23] <dduncan> that is all

[01:23] <nothingmuch> but the fact that strings are higher level than buffers

[01:24] <nothingmuch> but can be canonicalized as bufers

[01:24] <dduncan> the purpose is to partly to simulate what CPAN users actually are dealing with, and it is a semblence more stable than the SVN versions

[01:24] <TimToady> semblances can be important.

[01:25] <nothingmuch> gee, ya think? ;-)

[01:25] <TimToady> that's why I dissemble frequently.

[01:26] <nothingmuch> =)

[01:26] <nothingmuch> so was that a pretend patch?

[01:27] <TimToady> I always pretend when I patch synopses that the implementation will just naturally follow along without effort.  :)

[01:27] <TimToady> If I thought too much about how *hard* some people are working on this, I might get to feelin' guilty or something.

[01:28] <nothingmuch> <3 svk

[01:28] <TimToady> instead, I sort of perform the Jewish mother trick: "that's okay, I'll just sit here without Perl 6 for a while."

[01:28] <nothingmuch> my dad does the jewish mother trick often

[01:29] <nothingmuch> though more subtle

[01:29] * kolibrie wanted to be a commercial pilot once

[01:29] <nothingmuch> wasn't it your wife who wanted you to be a helicopter pilot?

[01:29] <nothingmuch> i thought you kinda didn't want to

[01:29] <TimToady> now you want to be a non-commercial pilot, or a commercial non-pilot?

[01:29] * nothingmuch puts his money on the latter

[01:30] <kolibrie> my mom wanted me to fulfill my dream of becoming a pilot

[01:30] <TimToady> me, I'm a non-commercial non-pilot...

[01:30] * nothingmuch still has that dream sort of

[01:30] <kolibrie> my wife decided it would be great if I could fly an EMT helicopter and she could be the EMT

[01:30] <nothingmuch> i want to learn to fly a glider

[01:31] <kolibrie> nothingmuch: that might be fun

[01:31] <nothingmuch> i'm assuming it is

[01:31] <nothingmuch> but ENOTUITS right now

[01:31] <nothingmuch> maybe in a few months

[01:31] * kolibrie is a private pilot now, but haven't flown for a couple years

[01:32] <kolibrie> very expensive to rent planes

[01:32] <nothingmuch> oh! i didn't know you actually flew

[01:32] <nothingmuch> i thought you let it go after a while

[01:32] <kolibrie> sort of did

[01:32] <kolibrie> I'm not pursuing it any more

[01:32] <nothingmuch> (that is, before you begun to learn)

[01:33] <nothingmuch> *you'd

[01:33] <nothingmuch> or perhaps *began learning

[01:33] <kolibrie> I think there is still a little left in my blood, for when I have money again, if that ever happens

[01:34] <nothingmuch> maybe you can do for-pay flights

[01:34] <nothingmuch> i heard it's fairly easy to get the certification level at which you can accompany a trainee

[01:34] <nothingmuch> and fly for free

[01:34] <nothingmuch> or almost free

[01:34] <kolibrie> only if I get a commercial license

[01:34] <nothingmuch> (i have a friend who learned to fly in the US and has been really rambling)

[01:35] <TimToady> maybe that's why they gave you the special pat-down treatment at the airport...

[01:36] <nothingmuch> perhaps

[01:36] <nothingmuch> oopps

[01:36] <TimToady> but hey, I have a friend who claims she's an anarchist...

[01:36] <nothingmuch> 10:50 noto 10:15

[01:36] <nothingmuch> she gets harassed for that?

[01:37] <nothingmuch> (at the airports?)

[01:37] <TimToady> no, but he did.

[01:37] <nothingmuch> oh

[01:37] <nothingmuch> that was all ingy's fault

[01:37] <TimToady> that's okay--ingy's good at taking responsibility

[01:37] <nothingmuch> =)

[01:38] <nothingmuch> "what doe G mean? I G NY?"

[01:38] <nothingmuch> idiots

[01:38] <nothingmuch> well, at least they don't ask "What do those shiny things stand for"

[01:38] <TimToady> grep?

[01:38] <nothingmuch> i think her current wardrobe is a little less suspicious looking

[01:39] <nothingmuch> i mean, i would totally not trust a nice looking person in a pink shirt either

[01:39] <kolibrie> I used to have a pink dress shirt my mom made me wear

[01:39] <TimToady> I don't think I've worn a pink shirt for a year or so...

[01:39] <nothingmuch> i like my pink dress shirt

[01:40] <nothingmuch> well, my pink shirt

[01:40] <TimToady> you don't have a pink dress?

[01:41] <kolibrie> I normally wear bright or bold colors now, pastels and such just don't do it for me

[01:41] <nothingmuch> no, i have a kilt

[01:41] <nothingmuch> but that shirt isn't very dressy either

[01:42] <TimToady> I don't know a tartan from a tartar from a tart.  Well, okay, I can recognize a tart usually...

[01:43] <TimToady> sure seems like a Friday night...

[01:44] <nothingmuch> the IRC channel?

[01:44] * nothingmuch will install a laugh-machine for next week

[01:44] <nothingmuch> and a drum set

[01:45] <nothingmuch> it should be a fiarly ismple IRC bot, and an aggregate bot launcher

[01:45] <nothingmuch> you'd say *applause* and then they would say "clap" at random intervals

[01:45] <nothingmuch> and then you would say *laughter* and they would say "haaha" and "lolz" and stuff (also at random intervals)

[01:45] <TimToady> It has to tell bad Muppet jokes I think.

[01:46] <nothingmuch> And that was nothing like a bad muppet joke, i think!

[01:46] <nothingmuch> *laughter*

[01:46] <TimToady> no, every bad joke is like a muppet joke!

[01:46] <TimToady> hrr,hrr,hrrrrr

[01:47] <TimToady> we'd like to thank our special guest tonight, nothingmuch.

[01:47] <TimToady> but we won't.

[01:47] <nothingmuch> *applause*

[01:47] <kolibrie> *clap*

[01:47] <nothingmuch> kolibrie: it has to be like 10-20 bots together

[01:48] <kolibrie> sorry, I'm only one

[01:48] <TimToady> hard to simulate a saxophone playing the wrong note though.

[01:48] <kolibrie> and not too good as a bot

[01:48] <nothingmuch> we could have an opbot that occasionally shouts ANIMAAAAAAAL and kicks all the channel

[01:48] <theorbtwo> It could say hahaha and then /nick to something else.

[01:48] <nothingmuch> but then again, nobody is op in #perl6 =)

[04:05] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 144: /

[04:05] <audreyt> (yes you are committer now :))

[04:38] <dduncan> I have a question about Synopsis 3 before I write to p6l about it ...

[04:38] <dduncan> what is ?| exactly?

[04:39] <dduncan> its mentioned only at the top in a section on bitwise operators

[04:39] <dduncan> but part of its description suggests it is the same as || but for its output type

[04:39] <dduncan> and || is not a bitwise operator

[04:40] <dduncan> eg, || returns the value of the first true argument, ?| returns simply true or false but not that value

[04:40] <audreyt> yup.

[04:40] <audreyt> also ?| evaluates both sides

[04:40] <audreyt> || may not

[04:40] <dduncan> the confusion isn't helped by that ?| isn't in the precedence table

[04:41] <audreyt> send a patch to p6l?

[04:41] <dduncan> I'm doing that anyway about other S03 issues ...

[04:41] <audreyt> okie

[04:41] <dduncan> but wondered if I should also ask about the meaning of ?| there or not

[04:41] <audreyt> nod

[04:42] <audreyt> it's just || that's eager and returns always a Bool

[04:42] <dduncan> it does?

[04:42] <dduncan> I thought || returned the first value that was true

[04:42] <dduncan> which may not be a Bool

[04:42] <audreyt> sorry

[04:42] <azuroth> ?| is || but eager & bool

[04:42] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . v

[04:42] <dduncan> yes

[04:42] <audreyt> ?| is just ||, _except_ it is eager and returns always a Bool

[04:42] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . v

[04:43] <audreyt> azuroth: interested in coding up runpugs? :)

[04:43] <dduncan> so it sounded like ?| belongs more with the tight-or operators rather than the bitwise operators

[04:43] <audreyt> azuroth: (as mentioned in http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/07/pugs_janitor_ta.html )

[04:43] <dduncan> would you agree or disagree?

[04:44] <audreyt> I think it's additive

[04:45] <azuroth> the interactive shell one, audreyt?

[04:49] <audreyt> azuroth: aye

[04:49] <audreyt> dduncan: I think it's on the additive layer

[04:49] <dduncan> well, I've just sent the message to p6l

[04:51] <dduncan> so check it out ... some of those should be easy fixes

[04:55] <audreyt> okay.

[04:55] <audreyt> I need to afk+sleep soon though

[04:55] <dduncan> sure

[04:55] <audreyt> *wave*

[04:55] * audreyt will be in Mooseland this weekend

[04:55] <dduncan> where's that?

[04:55] <audreyt> once I got my head fully around it I'll return to Pugsland and get 6.28.0 Done Correctly With Full Moose Power

[04:56] <audreyt> dduncan: http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/07/moosifying_jift.html

[04:56] <dduncan> by the way, will there be more picture taking of live Moose at OSCON?

[04:56] <audreyt> I don't know

[04:56] <dduncan> as I plan to make heavy use of it and/or contribute to it, might be worth joining the crowd

[04:57] <audreyt> I think you'll make a great lambdamoose

[04:57] <audreyt> or moosecamel. or something :)

[04:57] <audreyt> but, *wave* &

[04:57] <dduncan> that said, I plan to use it by way of v6, but its still use

[04:57] <dduncan> yes, yes, & away

[04:57] <audreyt> sure, but v6 is all just sugar; if you want anything from the API, need to hack at moose layer

[04:58] <dduncan> so I can still contribute to it

[12:14] <gaal> does pugs' objectspace need to be bootstrapped at runtime? is it easier to do it that way or just more pure?

[17:34] <merlyn> my interview ... http://www.twit.tv/floss9 - schedules of perl6 discussed

[17:34] <lambdabot> Title: The TWiT Podcast Network with Leo Laporte

[17:34] <merlyn> now you can all make me a liar. :)

[17:34] <audreyt> I'll call you a cab :)

[17:35] * audreyt listens

[17:36] <audreyt> mm, no transcription

[17:36] <audreyt> for the hearing-impaired among us, what did you say about schedule of perl6? :)

[17:50] * Termy is back (gone 00:34:47)

[17:51] <xerox> audreyt - It'd be great if you could tell us some other informations on #haskell about the Cabal affair! I'll be right back.

[18:29] <nothingmuch> gaal!

[18:29] <ingy> :)

[18:30] <gaal> how was the eventual flight?

[18:30] <nothingmuch> rather eventful

[18:30] <merlyn> I basically gave my best guess, which is an alpha release end of this year, beta next summer, and usable for production another six months to a year down.

[18:30] <nothingmuch> they were a half hour late due to cargo issues on departure

[18:30] <nothingmuch> and then even more late when security jocks raided the plane on arrival

[18:30] <merlyn> however, I've said that exact same timeline three years ago. :)

[18:30] <nothingmuch> and then said "ok, you can go"

[18:31] <nothingmuch> funny thing is

[18:31] <nothingmuch> i forgot to empty/depressurize my stove fuel bottle

[18:31] <nothingmuch> so despite having been "selected" i virtually had a bomb on the plane

[18:32] <gaal> you could have got into some trouble for that...

[18:32] <nothingmuch> yes

[18:32] <nothingmuch> that was very stupid of me

[18:32] <nothingmuch> but even stupider of them for missing it
