[12:14] <markstos> Ok. Thanks for the response clkao.

[12:32] <clkao> glasser: i don't think so

[12:32] <glasser> well, pugs doesn't ship with a Makefile

[12:32] <glasser> and running perl Makefile.PL wants ghc

[12:53] <agentzh> you're still in Kunming?

[12:53] <xinming> are you also in Kunming? :-)

[12:53] <agentzh> heh

[12:53] <xinming> agentzh, haha, Never met a perl people in China in real life. :-/

[12:53] <agentzh> nope, i'm in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province.

[12:54] <xinming> agentzh, hmm, How do you know that I'm in Kunming currently?

[12:54] <agentzh> here're a handful of perl hackers in my university

[12:55] <agentzh> in fact i'm not sure. because you ever mentioned Kunming in this channel,  i think

[12:56] *** vel joined
[12:56] <xinming> hmm, I don't meet much, Maybe because I never go into univerisity... :(

[12:56] <agentzh> currently i'm reading Perl 6 Synopses. I've found some typos and have reported them to p6-l.

[12:57] <agentzh> audreyt is very responsive.

[12:57] <agentzh> now i'm a perl 6 monger.

[12:58] *** mauke_ is now known as mauke

[12:58] <xinming> Yes. She'll fix bug and answer your question quickly. :-P

[12:58] <agentzh> extremely quickly in fact. ;-)

[12:59] <agentzh> hopefully i'll be able to help out fglock and clkao with the v6.pm stuff some time later

[13:00] <agentzh> v6-alpha and PCR are really impressive.

[13:01] * xinming is newbie, and he can do nothing except writing test. :-/

[13:01] <agentzh> IIRC you've been rather active on the Perl 6 land for some time already. :-)

[13:02] <agentzh> i often see your name while lurking here and p6-l

[13:02] <agentzh> and it seems to me you're 1 year older than i. :-)

[13:06] <xinming> but I'm not capable. :-/

[13:07] <agentzh> i don't think so. :=)

[13:07] <xinming> agentzh, BTW, what are your version control system?

[13:07] <xinming> I mean, do you use subversion or svk?

[13:07] <agentzh> last year i was using svk.

[13:08] <agentzh> but svk is very unstable on Win32. so i've switched back to SVN this year.

[13:08] <agentzh> i'm a Win32 person. :=)

[13:08] <agentzh> yesterday i "rant" on svk for that issue.

[13:08] <xinming> hmm, I'd say, If you use svk, and need bootstrap files for pugs and parrot,  you can get it from perlcabal.org/~xinming/

[13:08] <agentzh> I think that's okay because clkao's svk is mostly rant-driven.

[13:09] <agentzh> wow, you're a cabal memenber now?

[13:09] <agentzh> *member

[13:10] <xinming> svk is good, though, there are some tough bugs...   eg. You can't use `svk push`, and then later using `svk -l push`,  This will cause collision with server, in many commits.

[13:10] <agentzh> looking...

[13:11] <xinming> I don't know if you ever encountered this problem.

[13:11] <xinming> agentzh, account of perlcabal.org is easy to get... :-P

[13:11] <agentzh> i often encountered this kind of problems in the past

[13:11] <agentzh> really?

[13:11] <xinming> agentzh, just /msg Juerd  :-)

[13:11] <xinming> agentzh, or send mail to Juerd

[13:11] <agentzh> gotcha

[13:12] <agentzh> i really hope i can obtain a feather account from Juerd because i'm behind a firewall most of the time and i need CGI:IRC

[13:13] <xinming> agentzh, but for now, I hardly use -l and --verbatim option, because these might screw up the svn server.

[13:13] <agentzh> `svk push` is a source of pain.

[13:13] <xinming> agentzh, without -l and --verbatim, It won't be a big pain.

[13:14] <agentzh> i've used -l, i'm afraid.

[13:14] <xinming> agentzh, don't mix these 2 kind of option, then, It's all ok,

[13:14] <agentzh> sorry, i've never used -l

[13:14] <agentzh> i don't think so. :-/

[13:14] <xinming> agentzh, yes, -l and normal push might screw up the svn server. at least, My server is ever screwed up. :-)

[13:15] <xinming> lost nothing though.

[13:15] <agentzh> but i've *never* used the -l option

[13:15] <agentzh> and svk still misbehaved nearly every month

[13:15] <xinming> then, I don't know why.

[13:16] <agentzh> i'm wondering if it is a Win32-specific problem

[13:16] <agentzh> i'm guessing there're always much fewer svk's Win32 users

[13:17] <xinming> but the idea of svk is really good. working offline, and mirror repository is really powerful, which means, we don't need to connect to get the svn log. :-)

[13:17] <agentzh> of course, svk is very very powerful. sadly it's unstable here. :(

[13:18] <agentzh> i just feel safe while using svn since it has never driven me mad.

[13:18] <agentzh> yes, getting svn log using an svn client really sucks.

[13:20] <xinming> agentzh, BTW, why don't you use Unix-like OS?

[13:20] <xinming> hmm, xinming now needs to work, might reply not very soon.

[13:20] <agentzh> because it's hard to find a Unix-like box in my university

[13:20] <agentzh> everyone here uses windows.

[13:21] <agentzh> i have no choice. :=)

[13:22] <daxim> hm.

[13:22] <agentzh> i'm always using others.

[13:24] <agentzh> tweaking Perl on Win32 always needs significant efforts

[13:24] <agentzh> for example, it's nontrivial to install CPAN modules (say, Jifty) to ActivePerl

[13:26] <agentzh> so i've even ended up with an AgentPerl installer built for myself and happily all my classmates prefer it to plain ActivePerl. :=)

[13:26] *** fglock joined
[13:26] <daxim> what's the difference between them?

[13:27] *** rodi joined
[13:28] <agentzh> i've installed many modules to ActivePerl (just like PXPerl).

[13:28] <agentzh> and i have made sure they *work* well together on Win32.

[13:28] <agentzh> and i've also modified some modules to support Chinese encodings.

[13:29] <agentzh> as well as many useful tools developed by myself.

[13:30] <daxim> I am intrigued and wish to subscribe to your newsletter

[13:30] <daxim> do you have a webpage with the details somewhere?

[14:38] <agentzh> audreyt, TimToady: is the grammar of this senstence correct?

[14:39] <agentzh> audreyt, TimToady: To be honest, I've got completely confused.

[14:39] <daxim> yes. the word "were" is in subjunctive mood.

[14:39] <agentzh> i know that part.

[14:40] <gaal> oughta be "in which it _is_ defined" (or was)

[14:40] <agentzh> but does "but" mean there?

[14:40] *** justatheory joined
[14:40] <agentzh> is the "but" leading a sentence or a phrase?

[14:41] <agentzh> s/but/rather than/, maybe?

[14:41] <hugues23> would that not be rather: "A C<CATCH> block does not see the lexical scope in which it is defined, but ..." ?

[14:42] <agentzh> yes, i second gaal's opinion.

[14:42] <gaal> no, the lexical scope it sees IS the one in which it is defined

[14:42] <gaal> dynamically, it's the dynamic callchain from the exception site.

[14:42] <hugues23> gaal: ok, i must say that wording confuses me too ...

[14:43] <agentzh> gaal: does a CATCH block see the dynamical scope in which it is called?

[14:44] <gaal> there could just as well have been an "and" instead of a "but" there.

[14:44] <agentzh> and? okay, gotcha

[14:44] <hugues23> gaal: that would help understanding, yes.

[14:44] <gaal> there are always both lexical and dynamic scopes.

[14:45] <hugues23> s/understanding/my &/

[14:45] <agentzh> fair enough

[14:45] <gaal> the sentence is saying what is in each of those scopes.

[14:45] <hugues23> gaal: got you.

[14:45] <agentzh> gaal: would please send a patch to p6-l or to audreyt and larry?

[15:50] <fglock> if AST 'nodes' are roles, then the return block in rules should be like { $/ does v6::AST::NBit } instead of { $/.as(v6::AST::NBit) } ?
