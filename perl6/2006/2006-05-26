[02:32] <KingDillyDilly> Should be called use.html because of the formatting they make you do. You need to know HTML more than Perl to post a decent message there. Same deal with perlmonks.

[02:32] <ajs_home> I'm very, very confused. Does wassercrats == Wikipedia

[02:32] <ajs_home> 's -Barry- ?

[02:32] <KingDillyDilly> Yes

[02:33] <ajs_home> Oh. I see.

[02:33] <ajs_home> Thank you.

[02:33] <KingDillyDilly> And Freenode's KingDillyDilly

[02:33] <KingDillyDilly> But Wassercrat != Wassercrats

[02:33] <ajs_home> And the distinction is?

[02:34] <KingDillyDilly> Wassercrat is some foreign Wassercrats hater, and I'm not.

[02:37] <ajs_home> Just trying to work out the timeline. Was there an altercation on Perlmonks prior to the Wikipedia thing?

[02:37] <KingDillyDilly> Yes. About 2-3 years before.

[02:43] <KingDillyDilly> Not about anything in particular. It was about everything.

[22:03] <joel_h> "make profiled" doesn't seem to work

[22:03] <joel_h> As far as I can tell it is just the -prof -auto-all arguments to ghc that break it

[22:04] <joel_h> specifically it can't find Data.ByteString when compiling src/Pugs/AST/Internals/Instances.hs

[22:04] <joel_h> though "make" alone runs just fine

[22:04] <joel_h> am I doing something wrong?
