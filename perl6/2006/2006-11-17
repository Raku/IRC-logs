[00:12] <TimToady> thx

[00:12] <TimToady> you okay?

[00:12] <audreyt> loumz: while you are at it, can you also fix the slides to point to the later-day .pdf slides instead of .xul?

[00:13] <audreyt> well, maintaining sanity, but online time is luxury

[00:13] <audreyt> need to run in 18min

[00:13] <audreyt> hopefully it'll all be settled next week and I can post more update

[00:17] <TimToady> workaround on Unix is just to type ^D

[00:17] <Limbic_Region> but that doesn't work

[00:18] <Limbic_Region> and I can't see anything that would tell me where it is hanging - going to turn on debug

[00:18] <Limbic_Region> infinite loops looks like to me

[00:19] <Limbic_Region> oh wait, it finally stopped spitting out debugging stuff

[00:20] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - you are right, ctrl-z does get it to finish, but it still takes several seconds before bombing

[00:20] <TimToady> in meeting, so distracted...

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> sorry, will try to finish debugging on my own

[12:13] <Pranavaswaroop> I just want to start with the documentation stuff and get involved with the perl documentation part

[12:14] <Pranavaswaroop> Now I need a job to get along

[12:15] <Pranavaswaroop> and contribute

[12:16] <audreyt> a good way to start is reading through docs/Perl6/*

[12:36] <fglock> the bootstrap sequence is MP6 source -> through v6.pm -> MP6-in-perl5

[12:36] <fglock> and then MP6 source -> through MP6-in-perl5 -> MP6-in-perl5

[12:36] <fglock> the second part is almost done :)

[12:37] <xinming> hmm, if i understand correctly, Doest that mean, after mp6 is self-hosting, then, we can use the 'result' mp6 to bootstrap perl 6?

[12:38] <xinming> How about parrot?

[12:38] <svnbot6> r14776 | fglock++ | MP6 - fixed 'for' again

[12:38] <xinming> hmm, Ok, I'll ask you after you've done the job. :-)

[12:39] *** iblechbot joined
[12:39] <fglock> xinming: no, Miniperl6 is only a small language

[12:39] <fglock> which Perl6 can execute natively

[12:39] <fglock> and it is easy to port to several backends

[12:40] <fglock> so we can use it as a first step to write full-perl6 - but it will require several bootstraps to get there

[12:40] <xinming> will there be a boost on speed?

[12:41] <xinming> bootstrap again again and again. >_<

[12:41] *** rodi joined
[12:45] <fglock> miniperl6 will be a bit faster than full-perl6, but that's just because it doesn't have many features

[12:54] <xinming> hmm, For parrot, Do we have to use parrot PIR to write a AST runner for MP6?

[12:54] <xinming> and then, compile the ast to parrot native asm.

[21:49] <stevan> TimToady: re: state conflicts in roles (I just read the latest design notes)

[21:50] <stevan> the approach we settled on in Moose was that attributes conflict by name, with no chance to resolve

[21:50] <stevan> its a little extreme, but things got way too messy when we tried to detect conflicts on a more granular level (between accessors, etc)

[21:51] <stevan> we pondered namespacing the role imported attr's slots

[21:51] <[particle]> we're trending towards role-based composition in parrot

[21:51] <[particle]> in fact, i suggested the use of 'metaroles' instead of metaclasses

[21:51] <stevan> [particle]: its a very clean way to put things together on the lower levels

[21:52] <stevan> [particle]: there is a paper about that, but the traits folks

[21:52] <stevan> it reduces the need to inherit metaclasses, which can get really really messy

[21:53] <[particle]> since we'll be doing roles anyway, why bother with metaclasses, i figure

[21:53] <[particle]> there's no reason for them

[21:53] <stevan> TimToady: the namespaceing of attribute slots from roles was ruled out as well, again, the whole auto-generated accessor conflicts

[21:53] <[particle]> stevan: i'd probably recommend that approach for parrot, as well

[21:54] <[particle]> if HLLs want to do mangling, namespacing, etc they're on their own

[21:54] <stevan> [particle]: the only issue (and they talk about this in the paper) is that you have a more complex bootstrap

[21:54] <stevan> because you end up needing a primative role and primative class

[21:55] <stevan> so the nice tied-knot of the metamodel gets muddied slightly

[21:55] <[particle]> hrmm. do you have a reference to the paper? can i just seach 'metarole' or do they just call them roles?

[21:56] <stevan> http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/cgi-bin/scgbib.cgi?query=Uniform+and+Safe+Metaclass+Composition

[21:56] <lambdabot> Title: SCG Bibliography, http://tinyurl.com/y87qs2

[21:56] <[particle]> fab, thx

[21:58] <stevan> they dont deal with state though

[21:59] <stevan> when i emailed them about a year ago on it, their response was "good luck, let us know how it works out"

[22:00] <[particle]> i'd respond, "thank you for the prototype, we'll build the release version" :)

[22:00] <stevan> :)

[22:01] <stevan> well they must be pondering it now, it looks like they emailed TimToady on it :)
