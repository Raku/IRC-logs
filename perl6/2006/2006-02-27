[00:10] <nothingmuch> so

[00:10] <nothingmuch> i have weird slides

[00:11] <nothingmuch> that are 60% done

[00:11] <nothingmuch> and I'm off to sleep

[00:11] <nothingmuch> does anybody want to look at them and comment?

[00:11] <nothingmuch> lumi: sorry for missing you

[00:11] <nothingmuch> my mac::growl (and inherently irssi growl script) is broken

[00:15] * Khisanth waits for the release of perl 6.6.6

[00:17] <nothingmuch> we saw weird license plates yesterday

[00:17] <nothingmuch> one with 666 and one with 777

[00:17] <nothingmuch> in the same traffic light

[00:21] <avar> obra: Hurd is shipping right now, Perl 6 isn't

[00:24] <obra> Hurd is shipping?

[00:26] <avar> yes it is

[00:26] <avar> until recently I had it running on one computer here

[00:27] <obra> . It is not ready for production use, as there are still many bugs and missing features. However, it should be a good base for further development and non-critical application usage.

[00:27] <obra> From their status page.

[00:27] <obra> That sounds like Perl6.

[00:27] <avar> yes, that doesn't mean that it isn't shipping

[00:28] <obra> I took your question to be "Which will ship first?"

[00:28] <obra> Pugs is shipping.

[00:28] <avar> can I download the Perl6 compiler that's written in Perl6 and targets parrot and make it run even simple programs right now?

[00:28] <avar> pugs doesn't really count, it's a seperate project

[00:28] <avar> that's kind of like saying "Yes Linux is shipping" to "Is Hurd shipping" ;)

[00:29] <revdiablo> Except pugs is implementing perl6, whereas linux is not implementing hurd

[00:29] <obra> Linux and Hurd are basically unrelated

[00:29] <obra> Pugs is part of the bootstrapping plan for Perl 6.0.0.

[00:29] <obra> So, What was your actual question?

[00:29] <avar> I didn't have a question

[00:29] * ayrnieu doesn't understand why people think that pugs doesn't count.

[00:30] <avar> <obra> Hurd won't ever ship ;)

[00:30] <avar> <avar> obra: Hurd is shipping right now, Perl 6 isn't

[00:30] <obra> avar: I apologize. It was elmex' question.

[00:30] <avar> I'll grant you that Perl 6 is kind-of shipping, but you're wrong about Hurd not shipping...

[00:31] <obra> Their website says it's incomplete and not production ready.

[00:31] <obra> Is their website out of date?

[00:31] <obra> http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html#status

[00:31] <revdiablo> obra: Maybe it's just that Hurd has been shipping incomplete and not production ready for a longer period of time?

[00:31] <revdiablo> =)

[00:32] <avar> obra: no, but it's shipping and you can use it for various things

[00:32] <avar> revdiablo: maybe;)

[00:33] <obra> avar: and I think that's a fine description of the state of perl6.

[00:33] <obra> It is not the state of "An implementation of perl6 in perl6 targetting parrot"

[00:34] <avar> I'd say Hurd was more advanced atm, although Perl 6 will probably be "finished" sooner, for some definition of finished

[00:34] <avar> they've been writing it since 1991 or something;)

[00:34] <obra> But that wasn't even the question!

[00:34] <avar> I.e. it generally works like it's supposed to works

[00:34] <avar> s/s$//

[00:34] <avar> I'm expanding on it!

[00:35] <obra> *snicker*

[00:35] <avar> The reference implementation of Perl 6 is supposed to be written in Perl 6 and target parrot, it's nowhere near that goal last I checked

[00:37] <obra> Last I looked, Larry had described Pugs as the current reference implementation. Which is different than the "Production" implementation. But I'm splitting hairs because my blood-sugar is crashing

[00:37] <obra> I'm going to wander off and fix that.

[00:38] <avar> been smoking pot?;)

[00:39] <obra> Not my thing, sadly

[00:39] <obra> Been working all day

[08:21] <nothingmuch> can we add a feather account?

[08:21] <audreyt> Juerd: fix it :)

[08:21] <TimToady> I could put it on my home public_html

[08:21] <nothingmuch> there was some legal issue, right?

[08:21] <nothingmuch> but that's not too fast either

[10:34] <xinming> in early Feb this year, why freebsd.org is blocked, I think because the soome reason which about the Kylin OS.(hmm, stop mentioning it), and the freebsd.org is block through DNS, Not the content.... And some site are blocked through the whole connection. eg... type some sensive words in google. It will block you for 5 minutes, and it will drop all package send to google.

[12:26] <levengli> i am new here (fresh from OSDC::2006::Israel). where can i find beginnner in

[12:26] <levengli> formation on perl6?

[12:26] <nothingmuch> levengli: hi =)

[12:26] <levengli> the equivalant to the camel book?

[12:26] <nothingmuch> are you familiar with Perl ?

[12:26] <nothingmuch> ah

[12:26] <nothingmuch> http://dev.perl.org/perl6

[12:26] <levengli> very familiar with perl.

[12:26] <nothingmuch> this has documents called Synopses

[12:26] <nothingmuch> which are the closest thing to a spec

[12:27] <levengli> i say the appocalypsis as well as the exegesis as well.

[12:27] <levengli> i meeant "saw"

[12:27] <nothingmuch> apocalypses are more of a food-for-thought kind of thing

[12:27] <nothingmuch> they were the fusion of accepted RFCs

[12:27] <szabgab> nothingmuch: Levenglick: http://www.osdc.org.il/person.html?id=44

[12:27] <nothingmuch> and more

[12:28] <nothingmuch> aha

[12:28] <nothingmuch> I am http://www.osdc.org.il/person.html?id=10

[12:29] <nothingmuch> the exegesis docs are outdated

[12:29] <nothingmuch> they are basically language demonstrations

[12:29] <levengli> i plan to hear your talk about perl 6 compilation

[12:29] <nothingmuch> but since they are explicitly designed to show off everything they are actually pretty yucky

[12:29] <nothingmuch> (code wise)

[12:29] <nothingmuch> it's going to be very handwavy =)

[12:29] <levengli> great. the synopsis it is

[12:30] <nothingmuch> the synopses are a delta to Perl 5

[12:30] <levengli> dont worry about the handwaving, it is what makes conferences go around :)

[12:30] <nothingmuch> =)

[12:30] <nothingmuch> i'm not worried about the handwaving

[12:30] <nothingmuch> i'm worried about the slides

[12:30] <nothingmuch> which are not 100% ready.... *aaaah*

[12:31] <levengli> :)

[12:36] <shmar> audreyt: Want to do the quickref/ops file... Am creating Reference subdir in docs/Perl6... Do I need to create a Reference.pod in the docs/ root as well?

[12:36] <audreyt> er no, we renamed Refrence to Overview

[12:36] <audreyt> so it's Overview::Operator I believe

[12:37] <audreyt> Reference is too overloaded a term

[12:37] <shmar> ok... good thing to note somewhere!

[12:37] <audreyt> indeed! like, in Perl6/Doc.pod or the README

[12:37] <audreyt> I mean, docs/Perl6/README

[12:37] <shmar> I agree... ok... making it Overview::Operator

[12:37] <audreyt> cool

[12:38] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int; method times (&block) { for 1 .. self { code($^i) } }; 5.times { say "foo" }

[12:38] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "f" expecting ";", statements or "}" not a class name or reserved word 

[12:38] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int; method times (&block) { for 1 .. self { code($^i) } }; 5.times { say "foo" };

[12:38] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "f" expecting ";", statements or "}" not a class name or reserved word 

[12:38] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int; method times (&block) { for 1 .. $?SELF { code($^i) } }; 5.times { say "foo" };

[12:38] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "{" expecting operator, postfix conditional, postfix loop, postfix iteration, ";" or end of input 

[12:38] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int; method times (&block) { for 1 .. $?SELF -> { code($^i) } }; 5.times { say "foo" };

[12:38] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "{" expecting operator, postfix conditional, postfix loop, postfix iteration, ";" or end of input 

[12:39] <nothingmuch> =(

[12:39] <shmar> actually according to Doc.pod, Operator is at Spec::

[12:39] <audreyt> shmar: nono, the idea is that we have the same file

[12:39] <audreyt> one in Spec and one in Overview

[12:39] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int; method times (&block) { for 1 .. $?SELF &code }; 5.times { say "foo" };

[12:39] <audreyt> or even one in Tutorial

[12:39] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "f" expecting ";", statements or "}" not a class name or reserved word 

[12:39] <audreyt> that serves different purposes

[12:40] <audreyt> it's like perlre, perlretut, perlrequick

[12:40] <shmar> aha. I get it... sorry am a bit thick... must be the atmosphere in here.

[12:40] <audreyt> respectively

[12:40] <shmar> got it...

[12:40] <nothingmuch> ?eval class Int { method moosen (&block) { for 1 .. $?SELF &code }; 5.moosen { say "foo" }; }

[12:40] <evalbot_9190> Error:  unexpected "f" expecting ";", statements or "}" not a class name or reserved word 

[12:40] <nothingmuch> URHGGJN#!T!#%

[12:40] <audreyt> nothingmuch: you are not making sense to me or to the compiler

[12:40] <nothingmuch> why not to you?

[12:42] <levengli> \whois audreyt

[12:42] <levengli> sorry :(

[12:42] <audreyt> np :)

[12:42] <lypanov> windows user? ;)

[12:43] <levengli> alas. please dont kill me

[12:43] <lypanov> hehe

[12:43] * lypanov refrains

[12:43] <audreyt> ?eval class Int { method moosen (&code) { (1..self).map(&code) } }; 5.moosen:{ say "foo" };

[12:43] <evalbot_9190> OUTPUT[foo foo foo foo foo ] (bool::true, bool::true, bool::true, bool::true, bool::true) 

[12:43] *** gaal joined
[12:43] * lypanov attempts to grok

[12:43] <gaal> "the code just flows" doesn't sound that attractive to me...

[12:44] <audreyt> "the point just floats"

[12:44] <szabgab> ?eval say "hello world"

[12:44] <lypanov> "the code is pretty and goopy"

[12:44] <evalbot_9190> OUTPUT[hello world ] bool::true 

[12:44] <audreyt> ?eval class Int { method moosen (&code) { for 1..$?SELF {code} } }; 5.moosen:{ say "foo" };

[12:44] <evalbot_9190> OUTPUT[foo foo foo foo foo ] undef 

[12:45] <levengli> i'll be beack in a year or two, after i ahve finished reading all the synopsis's

[12:45] <lypanov> audreyt: i'm impressed. i can grok this

[12:45] * lypanov debates reading them also

[12:45] <audreyt> lypanov: Zeno's Paradox detected. :)

[12:45] <shmar> :)

[12:46] <audreyt> lypanov: er, well, it's just ruby :)

[12:46] <lypanov> audreyt: exactly ;)

[12:46] * lypanov is distracted by wikipedia's page on zeno's paradox now :P

[12:46] <lypanov> hehehehehehe

[12:47] <lypanov> audreyt: nice ref :)

[12:48] <audreyt> lypanov: perhaps more interestingly:

[12:48] <audreyt> ?eval multi neg_repeat (Int $x, Str $s) { [~] $s xx -$x }; neg_repeat(-4, "foo")

[12:48] <evalbot_9190> "foofoofoofoo" 

[12:48] <audreyt> now that's not quite ruby :)

[12:50] <lypanov> can i talk to evalbot_9190 in private or?

[12:50] <lypanov> ?eval 5

[12:50] <evalbot_9190> 5 

[12:50] <blm> is self a keyword in perl6? ie no need to do my ($self) = @_;

[12:50] <lypanov> evidently not

[12:50] <audreyt> blm: yes it is

[12:50] <blm> audreyt: Thanks

[12:50] <lypanov> eval "h" xx 3

[12:51] <lypanov> ?eval "h" xx 3

[12:51] <evalbot_9190> ("h", "h", "h") 

[12:51] <lypanov> everyone just ignore the bot ;)

[12:51] <audreyt> ?eval class Int { method ego { self } }; say 1.ego

[12:51] <evalbot_9190> OUTPUT[1 ] bool::true 

[12:51] <audreyt> lypanov: it might pay off in the long term to 1)apt-get install pugs and 2)use the interaction shell

[12:52] <audreyt> (or check it out from svn, as building pugs is now much faster)

[12:52] <shmar> :)

[12:52] <lypanov> Get:4 http://ftp.nl.debian.org unstable/main pugs 6.2.10-4 [1662kB]

[12:52] <lypanov> new enough?

[12:52] <shmar> audreyt: testing is taking hella long though!

[12:52] <blm> audreyt: You are adding a method to Int or creating a new Int class?

[12:52] <audreyt> shmar: indeed

[12:52] <audreyt> blm: adding a method to Int, as everything is by default open

[12:52] <xinming> audreyt: hmm, will there be collision if get a method and sub with same name?

[12:52] <gaal> ?eval sub hw($n) { $n ?? "~V" ~ hw($n-1) !! "~V~" }; hw 3

[12:52] <xinming> in a class.

[12:52] <evalbot_9190> "~V~V~V~V~" 

[12:52] <blm> audreyt: Thanks :-)

[12:53] <audreyt> xinming: yes there will, just like two subs with the same name

[12:53] <xinming> eg: class A { method t { }; sub t { } };

[12:53] * lypanov makes funny faces at all the double symbols :P

[12:53] <gaal> lypanov: s/hw/handwave/ and all will become obfuscated

[12:53] <xinming> audreyt: hmm, then, How to make perl 6 act as perl 5 does? eg, make a sub both method and sub.

[12:53] <lypanov> ummm

[12:54] <audreyt> xinming: you say "submethod"!

[12:54] <lypanov> is pugs shell really meant to bail on bad code?

[12:54] <audreyt> (really, seriously, that's the way.)

[12:54] <xinming> in perl 5, we can in fact call a sub directly, and also act as a method...

[12:54] <audreyt> lypanov: well... 6.2.10 has a bad (non-ruby-influenced) shell

[12:54] <lypanov> audreyt: want me to be a total git and report lots of things i dislike in perl6?

[12:55] <audreyt> xinming: yup, and even if you declared something as a method, you can still call it directly

[12:55] <lypanov> (/me already knows the response is yes hehe)

[12:55] <audreyt> lypanov: it'd be better if you 1)write it down in a buffer and 2) nopaste/link to it

[12:55] <blm> ?eval say "Hello, world!"

[12:55] <lypanov> audreyt: would always do so

[12:55] <audreyt> IRC is too noisy for this :)

[12:55] <evalbot_9190> OUTPUT[Hello, world! ] bool::true 

[12:55] <audreyt> lypanov: woot, then sure, definitely!

[12:55] <lypanov> audreyt: it'd be "grar. this sucked" sessions while in the train

[12:55] <audreyt> lypanov: sure, but in that case please pull the latest svn code

[12:56] <lypanov> audreyt: shall do

[12:56] <audreyt> to save us both times over already-fixed bugs

[12:56] <audreyt> woot

[12:56] <audreyt> lypanov++

[12:56] <xinming> hmm, class A { method t is export { "test".say } }; t();   <=== will this be valid example?

[12:56] <audreyt> my gripe with ruby can be summarized to: "I can't tell it to pretend to be a static language"

[12:56] <lypanov> audreyt: "Currently, the P6Doc files are installed along with Pugs, into Perl5's sitelib path and formatted as manpages. "

[12:57] <shmar> running make test now for at least an hour!

[12:57] <lypanov> audreyt: there are html versions of this anywhere?

[12:57] <audreyt> xinming: you are outside class A... so you need to call it A::t()

[12:57] <audreyt> lypanov: will do so once I get sufficient sleep

[12:57] <audreyt> which means e.g. tomorrow

[12:57] <xinming> audreyt: Ok

[12:57] <shmar> or is that another Xeno?

[12:57] <shmar> ;)

[12:57] <audreyt> lypanov: (packaging it to Perl6::Doc and uploading it to CPAN gets us HTML for free)

[12:57] <lypanov> audreyt: okay. i'll work on compiling. whenever you managed to get this up ping me if you could then i'll read :)

[12:57] <lypanov> audreyt: *nod*

[12:58] <audreyt> lypanov: cool -- meanwhile there's always the docs/quickref/ tree 

[12:59] <lypanov> audreyt: has difficulty reading text without differentiating font styles :)

[12:59] <audreyt> I see :)

[12:59] * lypanov gets distracted far too quickly alas without interaction

[12:59] * audreyt understands it, perhaps too acutely

[12:59] <lypanov> heh

[13:00] <shmar> ALL: are the Perl6 pods supposed to be differential (ie to perl5) or absolute?

[13:00] <shmar> IE: should I be writing as though the reader knows perl5 or not?

[13:01] * lypanov would say the latter, but has no real say ;)

[13:01] <shmar> I agree... 

[13:02] <shmar> In which case I will *cough* plagiarise *cough* liberally from the existing perldoc....

[13:02] <lypanov> maybe just provide references?

[13:03] <shmar> hmmm....

[13:03] <lypanov> (assuming they are large sections)

[13:03] <shmar> can we get a ruling

[13:03] <shmar> ?

[13:04] <audreyt> shmar: plagiarise is the one true way to go -- but in Overview, just provide enough info to get people started

[13:04] <audreyt> think perlrequick and perlintro

[13:04] <shmar> ok...

[13:05] <audreyt> but just commit ahead -- we can always refactor :)

[13:05] <audreyt> (and I agree, shouldn't assume too much p5 knowledge)

[13:05] <chris2> hey lypanov, audreyt et al.

[13:05] <audreyt> we have the Perl6::Perl5::Porting and other ::Perl5::* for that

[13:05] <lypanov> yoyo chris2

[13:05] * lypanov should stop reading up on the zeno's paradoxes :P

[13:05] <shmar> ok.. gotcha...

[13:05] <gaal> I am never forget the day I first meet great perldoc

[13:05] * lypanov goes back to $job

[13:06] * audreyt should really start writing to sasada/takahashi/matz/other_ruby_people for the Tokyo hackathon

[13:07] <audreyt> lypanov: after 2 hours or so (which is longer than our attention spans, combined), http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Bible/ should show a new batch of HTMLified Synopses

[13:10] <nothingmuch> audreyt: please reload slides

[13:10] <nothingmuch> i've clarified and cleaned up, i think

[13:10] <nothingmuch> or at least hope

[13:10] <nothingmuch> will continue to garbage collect

[13:11] <audreyt> nothingmuch: url?

[13:11] <shmar> argh.... no 'up' history in interactive mode!

[13:11] <audreyt> shmar: can't be... if you have readline we use it

[13:11] <audreyt> (for GHC 6.4.1)

[13:11] <audreyt> alternatively, use rlwrap

[13:11] <audreyt> which is cheap and cheerful

[13:12] <lypanov> audreyt: thx. bookmarked

[13:54] <audreyt> you just need to practice on foxdrawing

[13:55] <szabgab> shmar: I  guess because of the local sysadmin firewalled sourceforge

[13:55] <lumi> Fox? I thought it was a cat

[13:55] <gaal> definitely foxes.

[13:55] <audreyt> Why's channel is Fox channel, not Cat channel

[13:55] <gaal> devoid of legs, but foxes still.

[13:57] * gaal requires C8H10N4O2

[13:57] * audreyt only has C14H19NO2

[13:58] <lumi> I can generate CO2 and N is very common around here

[13:58] * chris2 is embarrassed he forgot the formula of ethanol

[13:59] <nothingmuch_> the former is caffeine and the latter is amphetamines?

[13:59] <nothingmuch_> H2SO4 is quite cinematic

[13:59] <nothingmuch_> there is a geek rhyme someone told me once

[13:59] <Odin-> Johnny was a chemist's son,

[13:59] <audreyt> nothingmuch: well, Methylphenidate

[13:59] <Odin-> but johnny is no more,

[13:59] <Odin-> what johnny thought was H2O

[13:59] <nothingmuch_> Odin-: =)

[14:00] <Odin-> was H2SO4

[14:00] <Odin-> :p

[14:00] <Odin-> There's numerous versions.

[14:00] <nothingmuch_> ofcourse

[14:00] <nothingmuch_> like the "great green globs of greasy grimey gopher guts" song

[14:00] <gaal> lithium is quite cinematic when coming into contact with water

[14:00] <nothingmuch_> Methylphenidate - designer amphetamines?

[14:10] <LeTo> audreyt: I've hacked feather ~lt/svnbot.p6 - it's using 'svn st -u README' to retrieve latest version (w/o log cluttering due to error message), but that needs that it's running in the local repo

[18:35] <putter> hi tewk.  just now discovered parrot's compilers/pge/PGE/OPTable.pir has nice algo documentation.  yay. :)

[18:35] <putter> was going to ask you for the 1k-foot level overview of parser.  but will look at docs first.

[18:36] <tewk> Yeah, it is nasty. It is essentially modeling a state machine.  The pretty solution would be to put all the local variables of the parse function into a hash and turn the labels into functions that take the hash as a parameter.

[18:41] *** xinming joined
[18:41] <putter> I'm thinking of doing a p5 reimplementation - clean, simple, and slow.  Context is I'm going to try doing the p6-regex -> regex-parse-tree transition with an opparser, since it's the "right thing", and we'll need the oop anyway shortly thereafter for the full p6 parser.

[18:41] *** dduncan joined
[18:47] <tewk> putter: Cool I'd love to see how it comes out.

[18:48] <putter> basically Regexp::Parser+continuation-backtracker (cleaned up version of spike) + opparser +p5/6-regexp-op-grammar provides p5/6-regexp -> match/parse-tree, tweak to regexp-ast, then regexp-ast -> rules-using-continuation-backtracker.   currently have or know how to easily do all the bits but the ooparser.

[18:48] <audreyt> putter: lwall and nothingmuch was syncing how to do that today

[18:49] <audreyt> we just went back from dinner after conference, where I just suggested (5min ago) that we start with p5

[18:49] <putter> oh, objective is to bootstrap a self-hosting "correct"/dynamic p5+p6 regexp engine.

[18:49] <audreyt> and ignore the nonregular parts

[18:49] <audreyt> eg => autoquoting the left

[18:49] <audreyt> and just focus on proving that the regular grammatical-category, longest-token-match, model works

[18:49] <audreyt> for a sufficient set of Perl 6 programs

[18:50] <putter> tewk: yeah.  we'll see.  "copious free time".  but the OpTable.pir docs look nice.

[18:50] <audreyt> i.e. just parsing t/*, not thinking about evaluation at this moment

[18:51] <putter> audreyt: putter thinks...

[18:51] <audreyt> in other news, Larry serialized both OpTree and syntactic parse tree as YAML::Syck today, which handles 95%+ of perl5 core tests

[18:51] <putter> oh, wow

[18:51] <audreyt> I may do a spike tomorrow morning on compiling that to p6 -- but we can't emit p6 yet, though anatoly asked for a task and I suggested that

[18:52] <audreyt> (anatoly is this wonderful lambdaperson I met in Arbel hackathon who grokked monads just from the Wadler papers in 4 hours)

[18:52] <putter> ;)

[18:53] <putter> audreyt: re regular being sufficient... I've had my doubts about that, but didnt want to make a fuss until things were working.  but fine for bootstrap/spike.

[18:53] <audreyt> putter: I have my doubts over the parsing model works or not

[18:54] <audreyt> even just for regular stuff

[18:54] <audreyt> because it's never proven for anything

[18:57] <putter> Full backtrack works :)  I've been thinking of the expr/statement extension stuff as simply a nice api, which may or may not be connected to how parser guts work, or the ast gets optimized.

[19:29] <nothingmuch> nor did i evere burn pizza ever!

[19:29] <nothingmuch> i burned *WAX PAPER*

[19:29] <stevan> I suppose lables in hebrew are easier for him to read 

[19:29] <nothingmuch> which i thought was a synonym for *BAKING PAPER*

[19:29] <nothingmuch> due to our host john misleading me!

[19:29] <nothingmuch> anyway

[19:29] <nothingmuch> shutup

[19:29] * stevan hands nothingmuch a thesaurus

[19:30] <stevan> fucking canadians :P

[19:30] <putter> so, the first NewEngland P6 Mongers meeting is July at the latest :)

[19:31] <stevan> putter: yes :)

[19:31] * nothingmuch pings stevan in private message for the FOURTIETH TIME!

[19:31] <stevan> there is actually a nice (cheap) conference center down here,.. on the beach too

[19:31] * stevan points out to nothingmuch that he has long since forgotten his freenode password

[19:31] <stevan> nothingmuch: ping me on irc.perl.org

[19:32] <stevan> if we coordinate well enough I might be able to get us some cheap rooms ($29 USD a night) and a small conf hall

[19:33] <putter> that could be quite neat.  wonder who all could make it...

[19:34] <putter> nothingmuch: re perl6_comp, empty, yes?

[19:34] <nothingmuch> putter: darcs pushing

[19:34] <nothingmuch> it's done now

[19:34] <putter> looking...

[19:37] * kolibrie might be able to make it to an east-coast something-or-other

[19:38] <stevan> kolibrie: nice

[19:41] *** Ovid joined
[19:42] <putter> nm: the talk slides only, yes?  read them a few hours ago when backlogging :)  let's see, thoughts...

[19:43] <putter> mostly agreement, so I'll focus on the things which seemed odd...

[19:44] <szbalint> Rules is the new name for regular expressions, right?

[19:46] *** samuel joined
[19:47] <putter> I think we're going to eventually need better vocabulary for talking ab out "parsing", etc.  p6 doesn't combine parsing and execution only from the perspective of the extreme dynamic syntax corner of the universe.  everyone else could consider it a combo.  so need ways to talk about more fine grain distinctions.

[19:48] <putter> biggest think is I don't think I really by the ast node replacement story.  I think p6 is itself powerful enough to do it at the code level.

[19:48] <putter> s/think/thing

[19:48] <putter> szbalint: yes

[19:48] <putter> in order of depreciation:  rules regex regexp regular-expression

[19:48] <putter> ;)

[19:49] <putter> nothingmuch: ?

[19:49] *** nothingmuch joined
[19:50] <putter> 3- i'm not sure I really understood the ffi as emitting argument.

[19:50] <szbalint> ty.

[19:50] * audreyt needs to 1)shower 2)sleep

[19:50] <audreyt> ttyl :)

[19:50] <lypanov> night audreyt

[19:51] <PerlJam> rules need a better name.

[19:51] * lypanov svn co's

[19:51] <PerlJam> something more jargony

[19:51] <szbalint> irregular expressions :)

[19:52] <audreyt> expressive regulations

[19:52] <lypanov> irregexps hehe

[19:52] <putter> actually, that's probably not quite right.  I kind of expect rules and regex to diverge and specialize.  eg, regex ends up meaning the pattern itself, and "rules" the bigger-picture grammar/Rule context/object.  maybe.

[19:52] <lypanov> nice :)

[19:52] <PerlJam> "regular expression" has a very specific, computing sciency meaning.  It even sounds esoteric.  "rules" just sounds plain by comparison

[19:52] <lypanov> putter: thats what i'd always understood actually

[19:52] <putter> lol # re iexps

[19:52] <integral> like LALR(\infty), but not?

[19:52] <integral> hmm, recursive descent is LA(\infty)?

[19:53] <PerlJam> Anything eulectic and euphonic is good.  (I wish I could think of such a name)

[19:53] <putter> PerlJam: very specific, long ignored ;)

[19:54] <Kattana> irregex? thats not very specific? are they context free or context sensitive or unrestricted?

[19:54] <PerlJam> putter: nah, we're always telling people to use HTML::Parser rather than REs because of the limitations of REs (even though they really don't apply  to perl, except when we try to limit ourselves to the tame)

[19:55] <putter> Kattana: unrestricted i believe, though particular engines may have other ideas.

[19:56] <Kattana> mhm I think so too, I have been reading wikipedia to catch up on all thise stuff

[19:56] <PerlJam> heh ... I just thought "well, I guess we'll have to just keep calling them rules because we already have the "rule" keyword"   hahaha; am I insane?  ;-)

[19:56] <audreyt> Grammar Rules

[19:56] <lypanov> naah, grammar sucks

[19:56] <lypanov> oh!

[19:56] <PerlJam> GRs

[19:56] <audreyt> P6GRs

[19:56] <lypanov> grar's

[19:57] <audreyt> Grammar Rule Expressions

[19:57] <PerlJam> not to be confused with the GRT

[19:57] <audreyt> => GRE

[19:57] <lypanov> gre's

[19:57] <lypanov> i could dig gre

[19:57] <lypanov> it has another meaning, but different domain

[19:57] <PerlJam> Grammars Ready to Eat!

[19:57] <lypanov> lol

[19:57] <audreyt> everybody knows GRE signifies intelligence and dedication and silliness

[19:58] <PerlJam> That works for me.  Now we just need to start using that term always so that the meme will propigate  :)

[19:58] <putter> oh, that's the other thing.  every time I start talking about grammars, I want to distinguish grammar, the concept, from Grammar, the p6 construct.  (also from grammar, as in p6, but not tied to some particular Grammar object)

[19:59] <putter> what should the grammar(1) parse, and how should we architect the grammar(3) from the available grammars(2).

[19:59] <audreyt> putter: p6 jargon so far is optimized for pun

[19:59] <audreyt> which has been my #1 roadblock as implementor

[20:00] <putter> oo, #1-ish, interesting...  I wouldn't have expected that.

[20:00] <audreyt> like, in day 5 or so I was confused about what Array means

[20:01] <audreyt> and it took me 10 months to figure out the punny parts and what each means

[20:03] * putter is still confused about what Array means... is it role?  a class?  (is a class now a role?)  a role/class parameterized on argument type?  on underlying implementation (how?)?  an abstract class?  I'm very fuzzy on it all.

[20:03] <lypanov> its a rolling class

[20:03] <putter> lol

[20:04] * stevan rolls up another Array and passes it to putter 

[20:04] * lypanov honestly has no clue

[20:04] * Kattana is furry with confusions, way beyond fuzzy.

[20:04] <Kattana> Although I now see how all the puns crept in.

[20:05] <Daveman> :o

[20:05] <putter> :)

[20:07] * putter ponders puns, prototyping prophalactic precautions

[20:10] <gaal> a lolling crass

[20:11] <putter> nothingmuch: my biggest question for you is do you think a ast node modification scheme is still needed, or can normal p6 be the ast and modification mechanism.

[20:12] <nothingmuch> sorry

[20:12] <nothingmuch> my brain is overflowing

[20:12] <nothingmuch> i have to do 3 things at once

[20:13] <putter> oh, no problem

[20:15] <szbalint> plenty powerful projects progress Perl: [paste preferred, people]

[20:15] * putter notes steven keeps handing me things I don't quite know what to do with. ;)

[20:15] <spinclad> TWIMC: the new Perl6-Bible seems to be missing S03.

[20:16] * stevan wonders what he gave to putter recently ?

[20:16] * spinclad could make a New England hackathon, would love to come

[20:16] <putter> stevan: was trying to remember.  dont quite.

[20:16] <stevan> spinclad: nice, where are you located?

[20:16] <putter> szbalint: lol

[20:16] * stevan takes away the Array he rolled for putter, youv'e had enough I think ;)

[20:17] <spinclad> brookline, MA (almost surrounded by boston

[20:17] <spinclad> )

[20:17] <putter> oh, awesome.

[20:17] <lypanov> spinclad: its right at the end

[20:17] <lypanov> spinclad: missing a title maybe?

[20:17] * lypanov has no idea how this stuff works

[20:17] * putter thinks it's time for a NE P6 Mongers wiki or some such.  If only to keep track of all the people.

[20:18] * spinclad likes nep6wiki

[20:18] <stevan> a mailing list might be easier to get started

[20:19] <audreyt> spinclad: fixed, cpan-uploaded, thanks

[20:19] <audreyt> (and yes I'm in the middle of shower)

[20:19] <spinclad> audreyt: thx and wow

[20:19] <lypanov> lol

[20:20] <spinclad> xinming: juxpatose: to juxtopose adjacent characters, eg ':$foo' -> '$:foo'.  (almost an autonym)

[20:20] <spinclad> s/juxto/juxta/ #oop

[20:22] <spinclad> similar to 'spinneroosm'

[20:22] <gaal> actually, "juxtapose" just means putting one thing next to another

[20:22] <putter> stevan (CT), obra (Bos), spinclad (Bos), putter (Bos),  anyone else NewEngland-ish?

[20:22] <gaal> not placing them in the wrong order

[20:23] <gaal> but the two are often mixed up :-)

[20:23] * kolibrie DC

[20:23] <putter> lol # gaal

[20:23] <spinclad> juxpatose: to interchange juxtaposed characters, eg ':$foo' -> '$:foo'.  (almost an autonym)

[20:24] <gaal> lol # spinclad 

[20:24] * stevan juxtaposes gaal's definition with spinclad's

[20:24] <spinclad> i think i had that in mind even, but couldn't squeeze it out my fingers

[20:24] <putter> stevan (CT), obra (Bos), spinclad (Bos), putter (Bos),  kolibrie (DC); anyone else NewEngland-ish?

[20:25] <gaal> putter: I plan to be New English in the temporal vicinity of YAPC

[20:26] <SolidState> hi

[20:27] * stevan looks into falafel scholarships in the Chicago area for gaal

[20:28] <spinclad> tuxjapose: to interchange adjacent concepts, eg 'interchange' and 'adjacent'

[20:28] *** calanya left
[20:28] <putter> NewEngland P6 Mongering: in vicinity: stevan (CT), obra (Bos), spinclad (Bos), putter (Bos),  kolibrie (DC).  plus, for a possible July(YAPCish) hackathon: audreyt, gaal

[20:29] * stevan click

[20:29] <SolidState> I'm not sure I'm reading Synopsys 12 correctly, should classes have a default constructor called "CREATE"? Or do I have to define my own (e.g. "sub new{bless{}}") the same way I did in Perl5?

[20:29] <stevan> s putter's edit button

[20:29] * spinclad too

[20:29] <stevan> SolidState: most of the time the construction will be done for you, you just augment it with BUILD

[20:30] <stevan> SolidState: Perl 6 will build your instance structure for you (if you want it to that is)

[20:30] <SolidState> Is that currently implemented in Pugs?

[20:30] <stevan> SolidState: most of it yes, but it is temporary until the real metamodel gets done

[20:31] *** justatheory joined
[20:31] <SolidState> That's okay, but I have a file with the contents "class Foo;

[20:31] <SolidState> \n

[20:31] <SolidState> 1;

[20:31] <stevan> SolidState: class Foo { has $bar; }; my $foo = Foo.new() will create a Foo instance with a slot for $bar

[20:32] <SolidState> and in Pugs I load Foo

[20:32] <SolidState> and then I try to create a new object:

[20:32] <SolidState> my $obj=Foo.CREATE();

[20:32] <SolidState> and it doesn't word :(

[20:32] <SolidState> work*

[20:32] <SolidState> *** No compatible subrountine found: "&CREATE"

[20:32] <stevan> SolidState: use Foo.new()

[20:33] <stevan> CREATE will almost never be called outside of the inner workings of the class

[20:34] <putter> can attributes be applied remotely?  eg, instead of  sub foo() is frabjous {...}, it's just sub foo() {...}  and then later &foo.is<frabjous> or somesuch.

[20:36] <putter> hmm, if signature, return type, body(?), are all attributes, that would allow complete separation of definition and assembly. :)

[20:37] <putter> pity they can't be lexically scoped... :)

[20:37] *** samuel joined
[20:37] <spinclad> lypanov: re S03, i see what you mean now

[20:38] <PerlJam> putter: what do you mean?

[20:38] *** GeJ joined
[20:39] <PerlJam> putter: you can make a lexical alias that hides the sub and has whatever attributes you want on it.

[20:40] <putter> PerlJam: right, but say...

[20:40] <SolidState> stevan: How come your suggetion (the one-line class definition+instance) works but when I put the class definition in a file and load it using :l in Pugs and then try the second part I get '*** No compatible subrountine found: "&new'"? Any ideas?

[20:41] <putter>  { infix:<+>.is<somethingorother>; 3+2+4 }    I just want the somethingorother property for... oh, you could

[20:41] *** rantanplan_ joined
[20:41] <stevan> SolidState: no idea, sounds like it is not loading your file right

[20:41] <putter> { my infix:<+> := $OUTER::infix<+>.clone.is<somethingorother>; ... }

[20:41] <stevan> SolidState: try 

[20:42] <stevan> say ::Foo.defined ?? "true" !! "false"

[20:42] <stevan> see if the Foo namespace is loaded basically

[20:42] <putter> though that changes infix:<+>'s identity, which was not a desired sideeffect.

[20:43] <spinclad> { &fib.is<cached>; fib(17).is<fast> }; fib(17).is<slow again>

[20:45] <putter> I just remembered how is() is implemented.  so I guess separate identity actually is the right thing, rather than a sideeffect.

[20:45] <spinclad> my foo is Sub; foo.signature(Int -> Int); foo.body:{...} ??

[20:46] <putter> is() is (optional) rule does()ing plus (optional, general) object mutation.

[20:47] <SolidState> stevan: I got "true"

[20:47] <putter> my foo is Sub;  ... putter goes to look at Snn...

[20:48] <spinclad> defining a sub should desugar to a series of steps something like this, I guess...

[20:50] <SolidState> stevan: can u reproduce my problem?

[20:52] <stevan> SolidState: sorry no, I havent compiled pugs in ages :)

[20:52] <putter> sub foo is Sub;  foo has signature; signature.trait_auxiliary:<has>(&foo,\(Int $x -> Int)); ... or something like that

[20:52] <SolidState> stevan: I didn't compile pugs, I downloaded the binary zip file

[20:52] <SolidState> stevan: 6.2.11

[20:53] <putter> a runtime mixin role, plus a hand call to <is>, which doesn't get done for you with runtime mixins.

[20:53] <stevan> SolidState: I would avoid the :l part and just "use Foo" in a file

[20:53] <SolidState> stevan: http://www.jwcs.net/~jonathan/perl6/ is where I downloaded from

[20:54] <SolidState> stevan: okay, I'll try that out

[20:59] <SolidState> stevan: From a file, the code works okay. So thanks :)

[20:59] <stevan> SolidState: cool :)

[21:00] <putter> nothingmuch:  multi emit(Any $x) {die "dont know how to emit $x"}  multi emit(MultiSub $f where $f.object_id == Perl6::Prelude::infix:<+>.object_id) {...}  emit(parse($p6code));

[21:00] <putter> or something like that, maybe?

[21:02] <ananiev> ummm

[21:02] <integral> hello?

[21:03] <ananiev> hi

[21:05] <ananiev> just wondered if perl6 is going to have a nice threads model, because itreads sucks for me and I have to use java to implement my server

[21:06] <integral> definately!

[21:06] <azuroth> what makes nice, for you?

[21:06] <integral> There's going to be lots of stuff on the lock-free programming/transactional memory front for a start

[21:06] <putter> nothingmuch: ok, I'm simply confused.  of course you have the ast anyway for compiling.  and now I understand you ffi slides.  looks good.  leaving the question, how do we bootstrap?

[21:07] <integral> also I hope for stuff like: @a = map -> $x { async { is atomic; f.($x) } }, @b;

[21:07] <ananiev> lightweight, everything shared

[21:08] <integral> hmm, there's a draft spec for this somewhere!

[21:09] <putter> ananiev: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory

[21:09] <azuroth> is atomic? I would've thought use would make more sense there

[21:09] <integral> azuroth: it's not a pragma but a adverbial modifier thingie to the block

[21:10] <integral> ananiev: try http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/Concurrency.pod

[21:10] <ananiev> thanks

[21:35] <putter> good to know.  thanks.
