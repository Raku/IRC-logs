[12:11] <gaal> emit_yaml is broken because there are no asYAML instances for VHandle, thus $*IN, $*OUT and $*ERR can't be yamlified.

[12:12] <gaal> should they be attempted to be yamlified at all here?

[12:12] <gaal> are there reasonable serializations to make?

[12:13] <gaal> Pugs.AST.Internals:1912 but you need DrIFT or to also edit Instances.hs

[12:13] <gaal> s/instance/method/

[12:15] <gaal> I notice that the prelude dump doesn't have that stuff in it. So emit_yaml should filter the env, right?

[13:15] <kolibrie> I've been trying to look at audreyt's deploy.xul talk, but I either get all the content as source if I hit the remote site, or a blank presentation if I copy it locally

[13:23] <gaal> I'm sure when she gets back from actually delivering it there'll be an update

[13:24] <kolibrie> I was hoping to share my last minute insights, or at least read it real time.  But now she'll be at least half way through the presentation

[13:25] <gaal> I remember the excitement of the live translation of P6:tU on the channel

[13:25] <gaal> but hey, you can read the source

[14:37] <audreyt> the .xul->.opml->.key compiler worked

[14:37] <audreyt> trying to write a decompiler now

[14:43] <miyagawa> amazing

[14:44] <miyagawa> so you wrote your slides in XUL and do presentation with Keynote?

[14:44] <audreyt> yeah.

[14:45] <audreyt> using omnioutliner as preprocessor

[14:45] <audreyt> also some xml magicks

[14:45] <miyagawa> wonderfully insane

[14:45] <audreyt> all done in the last 3 hours

[14:45] <audreyt> (finished 1.5mins before the talk starts)

[14:45] <miyagawa> that's usually we do

[14:45] <audreyt> yeah

[14:45] <miyagawa> :)

[14:45] <obra> it's really, really scary insane

[14:45] <obra> but looked sexy

[14:45] <audreyt> apxl is really hard to gen directly

[14:45] <miyagawa> audrey is always sexy

[14:46] <audreyt> :D

[14:46] <takesako> wow

[14:46] <audreyt> probably can do it without omnioutliner

[14:46] <obra> Simon did it for keynote 1.0, bitd

[14:46] <obra> 404 last time i looked

[14:46] <audreyt> but I don't see a APXL binding

[14:46] <audreyt> bitd?

[14:46] <obra> Back in the day

[14:46] <audreyt> ahh.

[14:47] <audreyt> the most nice thing is Text::VimColor

[14:47] <audreyt> I missed that with Sporx/Takahashi.js

[14:47] <audreyt> some of the code examples really benefitted from synhilite

[14:48] <obra> they did

[15:08] <xerox> Certainly p6 code looks clearer than p5.

[15:09] <Dyoes> xerox when will perl will be release ?

[15:09] <Dyoes> 6

[15:09] <xerox> Did you see audreyt's slides? (-:

[15:09] <Dyoes> i mean as a final version

[15:09] <Dyoes> or something near it

[15:10] <xerox> Final version of what? I don't know how and when the standardization process finish.

[15:10] <audreyt> by Christmas

[15:10] <ruz> audreyt: slide 69, qr{...}x<-- no x on slide, also drop semicolon

[15:11] <Dyoes> its true perl6 will be able to produce .net code?

[15:11] <audreyt> and #71 too

[15:11] <audreyt> thanks, fixed

[15:11] <audreyt> Dyoes: I don't know, that depends on how much hackathon I get next week in redmond

[15:16] <xerox> audreyt: what does omnioutliner exactly provide?

[15:16] <audreyt> .opml->.key

[15:17] <audreyt> so instead of APXL output, I gen opml then do more tweaking at .key stage

[15:17] <xerox> Acronyms.. (:

[15:18] <xerox> `OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML format for outlines.'

[15:18] <xerox> What's .key ?

[15:18] <miyagawa> i'm impressed that OPML has that useful feature other than just listing RSS feed <outline/>s

[15:19] <audreyt> .key is the extension of keynote presentations

[15:19] <audreyt> it contains a .apxl.gz file that is the content of the presentation

[15:19] <audreyt> as a serialized-via-xml set of NextStep objects

[15:20] <audreyt> ruz: updated http://pugs.blogs.com/talks/npw06-deploying-perl6.pdf
