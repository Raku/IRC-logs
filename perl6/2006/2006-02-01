[00:00] <bluefeet> Hey, nothingmuch over on perl.org#catalyst told me that someone in here would be able to point me at some code that generates colors for nicknames.

[00:00] <bluefeet> Anyone know what/where that code would be?

[00:01] <obra> bluefeet: I think you want to see ian langworth's cpan directory

[00:05] <comet^> 'generates colors for nicknames' is an impossibly vague description.

[00:05] <xinming1983> Juerd: ??? what does serious mean? :-S

[00:06] <bluefeet> obra: thanks!

[05:14] <dduncan> hello hello

[05:15] <dduncan> I was offline for the last 6 hours due to heavy winds bringing down my ISP's connections

[05:15] <dduncan> but a smoke of r8895 was completed during that time, and I just uploaded it

[05:16] <dduncan> this shows 13 failures of 11120, or 99.88% success

[05:16] <dduncan> on darwin/haskell normal

[05:20] <dduncan> those 13 failures were in t/pugsrun/09-dash-uppercase-c.t (6) plus t/rules/from_perl6_rules/capture.t (7)

[05:20] <dduncan> I've pulled to 8898, which may fix some of those

[05:25] *** jasho left
[05:32] <audreyt> not afaics. I'll look at your smokes

[05:32] <audreyt> what's the parrot version?

[05:32] <audreyt> <- just woke up, going to find some lunch, bbiab

[05:33] <dduncan> I am now pushing a fix

[05:33] <audreyt> woot

[05:33] <dduncan> essentially, there was a test that was supposed to bow out if rules support was missing (I haven't linked PGE)

[05:34] <dduncan> but it only printed out 65 skips, and didn't exit too

[05:34] <audreyt> ahh.

[05:34] <dduncan> so the output was 65 skips plus 11 failures

[05:34] <svnbot6> r8899 | Darren_Duncan++ |  r2285@darren-duncans-power-mac-g4:  darrenduncan | 2006-01-31 21:32:59 -0800

[05:34] <svnbot6> r8899 | Darren_Duncan++ |  t/rules/from_perl6_rules/capture.t : made the script exit when it determines rules support is missing, rather than running those tests anyway, in addition to skipping everything

[05:34] <dduncan> now I'll check the other file

[05:38] <dduncan> audreyt, I see you're a late-to-bed-late-to-rise person, as am I

[05:39] <dduncan> typically I go to bed at 1-3 am and get up at 11am-noon, in time for lunch

[05:39] <dduncan> currently its 9:39pm here

[05:40] <dduncan> as for t/pugsrun/09-dash-uppercase-c.t, I reran it directly and there were no errors

[05:40] <dduncan> so either the errors only appear in smoke mode, or that was a transient problem which went away, or a recent checkin fixed it

[05:43] <dduncan> I will now start another smoke, for the record

[05:43] <audreyt> k

[05:44] <audreyt> or you can use "prove"

[05:44] <dduncan> what is that?

[05:44] <audreyt> env HARNESS_PERL=./pugs prove t/pugsrun/09-dash-uppercase-c.t

[05:44] <audreyt> will run one test using harness

[05:44] <audreyt> very useful

[05:45] <audreyt> see "perldoc prove" for details

[05:45] <dduncan> and it will update the smoke.html in-place?

[05:45] <audreyt> er, no, but at lesat you can simulate the harnessed confition

[05:45] <audreyt> condition, even

[05:45] <dduncan> okay, that's useful there for ruling out the problem

[05:46] <dduncan> I also suggest the power brownouts I was having at the time may be related

[05:46] <dduncan> they were during that last smoke

[05:46] <dduncan> I don't have a UPS, just a surge protector

[05:48] <audreyt> bbl

[05:51] <dduncan> running env HARNESS_PERL=./pugs prove t/pugsrun/09-dash-uppercase-c.t shows all tests successful

[07:29] *** justatheory joined
[07:29] <dduncan> it came rather without warning, and there weren't more since; I decided to risk coming back on

[07:31] <dduncan> but there is a lot of wind and rain, has been all day

[07:32] <dduncan> normally, lightning comes in groups, and we can hear ones further away before they get closer

[07:32] *** justatheory joined
[07:32] <dduncan> maybe the wind drowned them out

[08:09] <hachi> his client is bouncing... you just ban the nickname, he can change his nick and rejoin when his client fixes itself

[09:52] <audreyt> comet^: or rather, /demand/ one :)

[09:52] <audreyt> dduncan: excellent

[09:52] <dduncan> its now almost 2am here

[09:52] <dduncan> will there be more release candidates, or are you going straight to release?

[09:53] <dduncan> and do you have any idea when that will be?

[09:53] <audreyt> I'm investigating parrot embedding segfaults

[09:53] <audreyt> but it's not really showstopping

[09:53] <audreyt> I'm happy to call the tree -pre1 at this point

[09:53] <audreyt> I'll ask around for more testers

[09:53] <audreyt> meanwhile writing release notes and chglog

[09:54] <audreyt> and then push the final release out somewhere in the next 6 hours

[09:54] <dduncan> sounds good ... should be done when I get up tomorrow, then

[09:54] <audreyt> nod

[09:54] <leo_> audreyt: is by any chance interpreter->lo_var_ptr not set properly?

[09:54] <dduncan> I have a question about ChangeLogs

[09:54] <audreyt> leo_: I have no idea what it is

[09:54] <audreyt> so that's possible

[09:55] <dduncan> I notice that some ext/ have their own ChangeLog files, and others record their own changes in the Pugs master changelog

[09:55] <dduncan> currently I am doing the latter

[09:55] <leo_> are you entering parrot runloop multiple times from different C stack depths?

[09:55] <audreyt> dduncan: I'd rather each ext/ report the major changes

[09:55] <dduncan> do you have any preference for what all/none of the ext/ do, or ...

[09:55] <audreyt> dduncan: in the main chglog, and put more details in their own chglog if desired

[09:55] <audreyt> dduncan: essentially what perldelta does

[09:56] <audreyt> (as a high level, one-paragraph-per-module summary)

[09:56] <audreyt> leo_: very likely

[09:56] <audreyt> leo_: in fact, almost guaranteed

[09:56] <leo_> then you have very likely a GC bug with embedding currently

[09:56] <dduncan> so if a module's delta can fit in a paragraph, it goes in the master pugs changelog, and if its longer, it goes in a module's own?

[09:56] <audreyt> and the workaround is to disable GC?

[09:56] <leo_> you could test by turning off DOD & GC

[09:57] <audreyt> dduncan: yeah, and leave a sentence or two in the main chglog

[09:57] <audreyt> leo_: yow... ok, will do

[09:57] <leo_> Parrot_DOD_block(interp) ; Parrot_GC_block(interp);

[09:57] <leo_> if yes, a change in the init sequence will very likely help

[09:57] <audreyt> k

[09:58] <dduncan> I think the details I put in the master changelog for my ext/ are short enough, so they should stay there

[09:58] <audreyt> dduncan: they look fine, indeed

[09:58] <audreyt> dduncan: thanks a lot for the various releng help... it's wonderful to have you around here :)

[10:00] <dduncan> fyi, as-of Pugs r6.2.11 (and Rosetta r0.720.0), there will be synchronized initial perl 5 and 6 versions of the Rosetta (rewritten) framework on cpan

[10:00] <dduncan> starting there, with the versions in sync, I will be including all the change details with the perl 5 version, and only a brief summary with pugs

[10:01] <dduncan> since the changes to each will largely be the same, the details with the perl 5 version would apply to the perl 6 one too

[10:01] <audreyt> sounds reasonable

[10:01] <dduncan> likewise with Locale-KeyedText, which is not part of Rosetta, but just used by it

[10:02] <dduncan> see you tomorrow

[10:02] <dduncan> good night

[10:02] <audreyt> leo_: amazingly, the segfault it is

[10:03] <leo_> looks like 'in' is NULL then

[10:04] <dduncan> p.s. I see another smoker has a rather crippled box ... taking 1605 minutes to smoke

[10:04] <dduncan> over 20 hours

[10:04] <leo_> bah - not NULL, just borked

[10:04] <audreyt> leo_: hmm?

[10:04] <leo_> in=0x29705090

[10:04] <leo_> that doesn't look like a valid STRING address

[10:05] <audreyt> it's a normal char*

[10:05] <audreyt> load_bytecode now takes STRING?

[10:05] <audreyt> since when?

[10:05] <leo_> audreyt: since 2 months or so

[10:05] <audreyt> ok, that's the problem

[10:05] *** G2 joined
[10:06] <dduncan> on the other hand, if a box started the smoke, then hibernated, and then woke and finished, the timer may be dumb enough to just subtract the start from end time to get the result, which could be what happened here

[10:17] <leo_> are you always running the whole sequence?

[10:17] <audreyt> no, just at init

[10:18] <audreyt> and also there's this segment after compreg that I forgot what for

[10:18] <audreyt> (that's it)

[10:19] <leo_> if you have GC related segfaults, you should use Parrot_init_stacktop instead of Parrot_init

[10:22] <audreyt> is parrot_config.o installed?

[10:24] <audreyt> right?

[10:25] <audreyt> somehow it doesn't sound right

[10:26] <audreyt> but ok

[10:27] <leo_> the idea is that any parrot is able to find it's libs, therefore prefix is compiled in via the _config.o

[10:28] <leo_> well, _config.o has all the Config.pm inside

[10:30] <audreyt> does a parrot-config remember its original src tree?

[10:31] <audreyt> the location that is

[10:31] <leo_> if there is a config var for that yes

[10:37] <leo_> that's from the packfile init sequence you pasted - missing const_table I presume

[10:39] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - I assume you still read Dan's journal but if you don't get a regularly feed there have been some interesting posts this month you may interesting in.  You seem to be interested in weird crazy blow your mind stuff

[10:39] <leo_> PF_create_default_segs should do it 

[10:41] *** nothingmuch joined
[10:46] <audreyt>     new_cs = PF_create_default_segs(interp, name, 0);

[10:46] <audreyt>     old_cs = Parrot_switch_to_cs(interp, new_cs, 0);

[10:46] <audreyt> like this?

[10:47] <leo_> PF_create_default_segs(interp, "dummy", 1);   // add to directory

[10:47] <leo_> I'm not sure if you need the switch_to_cs, but doesn't harm I think

[10:50] <leo_> another solution of that PF issue could be:

[10:50] <leo_>     pf = Parrot_readbc(interpreter, "temp.pbc");

[10:50] <leo_>     Parrot_loadbc(interpreter, pf);

[10:50] <leo_> where that load PBC is the PGE loading code

[10:50] <leo_> i.e. your pugs_init.pir

[11:21] <nothingmuch> leo_: vtable question

[11:21] <nothingmuch> does parrot analyze to see if there are any subsequently non virtual methods for a given object?

[11:22] <nothingmuch> thus doing away with the vtable indirection if there's no possibility of method ... going to any other method?

[14:20] *** cdpruden joined
[14:22] <audreyt> putter: priority is to "make unoptimised" again and check that warnings has gone away

[14:22] <audreyt> putter: then a smoke on pre1 would be helpful; there will be failures on t/rules/ due to segfaulting, but everything else should be clean

[14:22] <putter> ok

[14:25] * leo_ is testing r8900 currently

[14:25] <audreyt> cool

[14:25] <leo_> how much faster is make test with an optimized ougs?

[14:25] <leo_> pugs even

[14:25] <audreyt> leo_: faster than the delta between make optimized and make unoptimised

[14:25] <putter> make will take a while...

[14:26] <audreyt> leo_: so the rule of thumb is, if you are going to run make test (or make smoke), then optimized is a better bet

[14:26] <audreyt> also, the make time is expected to drastically reduce on the next release

[14:26] <leo_> ok

[14:26] <audreyt> the current -CPugs based #include in Run.hs will be replaced by YAML

[15:05] <putter> tewk: for after the release, if there is something in particular you wanted to do with p5 rules, let me know.  while there isn't a "rules on p5", there are (several) approximations, which may or may not help you.  though effort is perhaps best spent getting the haskell version spun up.  or cleaning up the pugs-side of the pge one.  or fleshing out the p6 one.  or... ;)

[15:07] <audreyt> ...or recode it in D 

[15:07] <audreyt> (which I still think is a sane choice, the apparent insanity notwithstanding)

[15:08] <putter> ;)

[15:08] <tewk> putter: I thinks rules are the coolest thing sense sliced bread.  I worked on the haskell version then, got busy and couldn't connect with audreyt.

[15:09] <tewk> But audreyt is back now and I've got some time so I will dig in again.

[15:09] * putter notes that ghc can perhaps warp one's perception of the likely stability of unstable software.  a haskell characteristic?

[15:09] <audreyt> ooh.

[15:09] <audreyt> putter: might be... though D does look like stable enough :)

[15:10] <putter> re bread, oh yeah.  :)

[15:10] <tewk> I ported alot of the pge pir code to ruby, in an attempt to understand the pir, once you spend 10 hours with it it isn't that bad.

[15:10] <audreyt> tewk: ooh. I'd like to see that ruby version.

[15:10] <audreyt> D feels like "compiled ruby".

[15:10] <tewk> audreyt: so how serious is your D idea, 

[15:10] <putter> re D, maybe.  and this might be a high profile enough application to get direct help from it's development team, which can make all the difference in filling in the gaps.

[15:11] <audreyt> tewk: quite serious. I want something that can be linked using FFI and perl5's Inline.pm and parrot's NCI

[15:11] <svnbot6> r8911 | autrijus++ | * add back past changelogs

[15:11] <putter> tewk: re rb code, me too.  note the pugs misc/ directory...

[15:11] <audreyt> tewk: so I need something that uses exactly the same c callconv

[15:11] <tewk> Well I'm in the middle of OpTable and Exp, probably where all the fun is and the goto magic.

[15:12] <audreyt> tewk: can you develop it under misc/ ?

[15:12] <tewk> the CPS style of the perl6 code looks interesting

[15:12] <tewk> I'll check it in, this in another one of my pick something up so I can learn a new language (ruby)

[15:12] <audreyt> tewk: so, exactly the same motivation as me and D

[15:13] <tewk> Well I have done a lot of c++, so maybe I can help with D

[15:13] <audreyt> D looks like what C++ could have been, honestly :)

[15:14] <tewk> where in misc, i'll check it in, I'm an earlly ruby guy, but I have great help.  One of the 37signals guys lives here in provo.

[15:14] <audreyt> but then, my C++ knowledge has bitrotted a lot -- the last time I used it is 8yrs ago

[15:14] <audreyt> excellent

[15:14] <tewk> or what c++ is trying to become.

[15:14] <audreyt> it'd be nice to see ruby gets p6rules support

[15:14] * putter notes p6's try/fail is actually not that slow.  so as soon as we have a regexp parse tree, (optimization is another todo item), some "directly emit p6" code might be interesting.

[15:14] <audreyt> putter: we already do

[15:15] <putter> C++ had different design objectives.  even before it hit committee. ;)

[15:15] <audreyt> Text.Parser.Rules can emit parse trees as Hs structures already -- hooking up a YAML dumper to it sounds sane

[15:15] <svnbot6> r8912 | stevan++ | adding PIL^N and ObjectSpace information to the ChangeLog

[15:15] <tewk> yep, but the c++ committe is currently seriously considering things like garbage collection

[15:15] <putter> *shudder*

[15:15] <audreyt> wow.

[15:16] <audreyt> colour me impressed :)

[15:16] * putter likes Stroustrup's model - C with types.  and if you want real oo, get another language. 

[15:17] * azuroth hopes perl 6 gets a super-pretty GUI api

[15:18] <audreyt> you mean, like, Eclipse?

[15:18] <azuroth> no, I mean a nice API to a GUI toolkit. 

[15:18] <putter> azuroth: wouldn't help to run smalltalk if it didn't, the st'ers wouldn't like it ;)

[15:18] <putter> ah, never mind

[15:18] <putter> but that too

[15:19] * stevan wanders off to deal with client issues ... oh well I guess my tuits are all used up &

[15:19] <putter> "a GUI toolkit"?  how about a nice half dozen? ;)

[15:19] <audreyt> stevan: enjoy :)

[15:19] <stevan> audreyt: yeah right :P

[15:19] <azuroth> I'm trying to be as realistic as possible, though

[15:19] <putter> having clients beats the alternative

[15:19] * stevan has to boot up his clunky windows machine ... there is no fun involved at all

[15:20] <putter> ah, ok.  can't argue with that. ;)

[15:23] <putter> so, on both rules and piln, creating some docs seems indicated.  a "conversation with audreyt".  and some design discussion.  there being quite a few paths through this maze between us and working rules/piln, and it would seem perhaps wasteful for folks to just scatter into it.

[15:24] <audreyt> yup.

[15:27] *** proller joined
[15:28] <putter> tewk: any particular things-to-do-with-rules that appeals to you? (I'm being drawn by "implement a half-dozen+ major languages".  not C++ ;).  C... maybe.  but definitely an old backtracking grammar I have for unpreprocessed C source.)

[15:30] <putter> rules are only a smallish part of that.  but it's neat to take say bigloo's scheme grammar (already in a regex like form!:) and collapse it down to rules.

[15:32] <tewk> I wrote an XQuery parser in scheme, that has multiple lexing states.  PLT Scheme provides lex and yacc like tools but I had to write all the switching between lexers myself.  That's when I wish I had rules.

[15:32] <putter> neat

[15:32] <tewk> One of the headaches of PyPy or RubyonRuby is parsing and tree generation, rules solves those problems too

[15:33] *** G2 joined
[15:33] <putter> have you seen.... oh what was it... some language that integrated XPath like stuff as firstclass language elements.

[15:34] <putter> re py/rb, yeah.  you currently have to fake :parsetree, but it seems almost too easy ;)

[15:34] <audreyt> putter: XDuce?

[15:34] <tewk> that is what i'm doing with scheme and xquery,  Microsoft will introduce XML as first class in VB.NET 9.  

[15:34] <audreyt> s/will/has already/

[15:35] <audreyt> (VB 2005 is available for download)

[15:35] <tewk> I've heard of with XDuce, haven't used it.

[15:35] <tewk> I think it is the next VB then, 

[15:35] <audreyt> it's this VB :)

[15:36] <tewk> LINQ is the MS project.

[15:36] <putter> never seen that before: We're Sorry. The SourceForge.net Website is currently down for maintenance. We will be back shortly

[15:37] <tewk> Well LINQ support is the next rev, some features did escape in the 2005 release.  But the next one will see a lot more.  

[15:37] <tewk> I'll have to go look at the new VB

[15:37] <audreyt> right, and you can download the LINQ preview for VB2005 already

[15:38] <audreyt> including XML integration in IDE

[15:38] <audreyt> # http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/

[15:38] <tewk> Yes you can download the preview, right but what exactly shipped excluding the preview?

[15:38] <tewk> LINQ == lambdas in c# and vb

[15:39] *** stevan_ joined
[15:39] <tewk> Unfortunately C# doesn't seem to be getting XML as first class.

[15:39] <audreyt> the XML data types, I think, and the base generics types

[15:39] <audreyt> but there's no sugar shipped in 2005 by default

[15:40] <audreyt> I think

[15:40] <tewk> Ok, right.

[15:40] <tewk> No sugar without the preview.

[15:40] <audreyt> yup

[15:40] *** Eimi joined
[15:41] <putter> tewk: have you seen any metaruby code?  the last time I looked, ripper output required a lot of postprocessing to get something usable.  was hoping things would improve, rather than say requiring a rewrite in rules (though that's largely automatable: run a modified ripper on a large corpus, dedup and you have the parse grammar ;)

[15:42] *** eric256_ joined
[15:42] <tewk> I think we have one of the seattle rug guys coming down next month to present to the local RUG about metaruby.  Most of the metaruby guys are in seattle.

[15:45] <obra> is an OSX 10.3 preflight useful right now?

[15:46] <audreyt> yes.

[15:50] <lypanov> putter: also wrote my own scrappy one based upon pyggy (python) but a) never finished it, b) never ported it to ruby

[15:51] <lypanov> ruth misses a few things, but at least its ast/dom based rather than sax like ripper

[15:51] <lypanov> parsetree is in a p4 repo, anyone can access it

[16:05] <mj41_> first 5 are passing

[16:08] <putter> lypanov: liked your rubydium/ruth 0.3 slides on http://www.lypanov.net/xml/development/rubydium/index.xml

[16:09] *** Debolaz2 joined
[16:09] <putter> re parse_tree, yeah, I'm confused (about something, not sure what;)

[16:11] <putter> ok, pre1 core failures all t/rules/from_perl6_rules/.  it was a make test, so ext/ tests didn't get run.  I'll do that now.

[16:11] <putter> s/all/are all/

[16:13] <putter> lypanov: one can automagically generate much of a rules grammar for ruby just by hacking ripper and running over rubicon.  that might be one way to go for a ruby-on-perl6.

[16:14] <putter> (haven't looked at the pyggy vesion yet)

[16:14] <svnbot6> r8913 | autrijus++ | * Changelog cleanup for -pre2.

[16:14] <audreyt> obra: aha, you need XCode 1.5.

[16:15] <audreyt> okay, rebooting to fbsd and then rolle pre2.

[16:17] <obra> audreyt: ah.

[16:19] <lypanov> putter: keynote is pretty nifty :) (the slides)

[16:19] <lypanov> putter: i'm not really too interested in ruby on perl6 if perl6 itself is sane :)

[16:21] <audreyt> lypanov: "eval could never work" not true

[16:21] <audreyt> if your eval can trigger gcc+dyld, of course it'd work 

[16:21] <audreyt> (re your rubydium slides)

[16:22] <audreyt> (hs-plugins has this System.Eval primitive, as does libGHC)

[16:22] <integral> I'd choose something like tcc over gcc though since it's faster

[16:22] <putter> libtcc++ http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/

[16:23] <audreyt> agreed

[16:23] <audreyt> uploading pre2

[16:23] * obra waits for xcode to download

[16:23] <lypanov> audreyt: oh sure, nothings impossible, but that solution is horrible ;)

[16:24] <putter> (for clarity: one can use libtcc to compile gcc-compatible C code, and link it, at runtime, without touching disk.  performance of the emitted code isnt great, but still...)

[16:24] <audreyt> lypanov: what putter said. not sure how horrible it would be, but certainly interesting

[16:25] <audreyt> mm it works on win32 also

[16:25] <integral> there's a tcc example that gives a bootable image that compiles the whole linux kernel from source at boot time :)

[16:25] <lypanov> audreyt: mainly from the perspective of marshalling and need for bc data structures that gets icky

[16:25] <putter> tcc is however very platform limited.

[16:25] <audreyt> integral: now that's... differently sane

[16:48] <putter> should INSTALL be updated to mention known issues with embedded parrot on some platforms?

[16:59] <audreyt> well, I imagine it shares a lot of substrs with ChangeLog

[16:59] <audreyt> so tarball bloat should be minimal

[16:59] <audreyt> generating it on build sounds possible.

[17:42] <audreyt> gaal: it makes for strange error messages

[17:42] <gaal> audreyt: so AST.Internals/drift too yes?

[17:42] <audreyt> as in a release tarball there's no way that someone can commit from there

[17:42] <gaal> right

[17:42] <audreyt> it makes little sense to ship it

[17:42] <audreyt> gaal: yup

[17:42] <putter> HEY EVERYBODY!  ahem.  if you have seen an embedded parrot failure on pre2, or r8906 or later, please let me know.  Thank you. ;)

[17:43] <putter> Oh, err, on anything other than win32 or x86_64.

[17:43] <audreyt> in any case, I'm on obra's machine

[17:43] <audreyt> and compilation worked just fine

[17:43] <gaal> putter: I'll test parrot/cygwin after audrey's current request

[17:43] <audreyt> mm parrot/cygwin.

[17:43] <audreyt> did it work before?

[17:43] <putter> gaal: ok, tnx

[17:45] <gaal> wtf? "can't find ghc in path". but it is in my path

[17:45] <gaal> Module::Install::Pugs thing

[17:46] <audreyt> or rather, can_run tihng

[17:46] <audreyt> trace the cygwin part in inc/Module/Install/Can.pm ?

[17:46] <gaal> k

[17:48] <gaal> ..is this run in the same process space as Makefile.PL?

[17:48] <gaal> (can I debug from perl -d M.PL ?)

[17:49] <rafl> gaal: Yes. I debugged stuff in inc/Module/Install/Pugs.pm that way yesterday.

[17:50] *** szbalint joined
[17:50] <gaal> thanks. (I needed b postpone for some reason though)

[17:51] <rafl> M::I doesn't seem to load its modules during compile time.

[17:53] <gaal> whoprovides MM->maybe_command?

[17:54] <rafl> gaal: ExtUtils::MM_*

[17:54] <gaal> anyway: can_run also has a bug in *non* windows systems, as it starts the search in the current directory.

[17:57] <gaal> okay, in any case: the problems is that the file is tested for -x, whereas in win32 it's sufficient to test it for -f && /\.(exe|com|bat|p6)$/

[17:58] <gaal> fixing.

[17:59] <gaal> (how did this work on native win32 I wonder?)

[17:59] <gaal> (does -x there act differently than on unix?)

[18:02] <gaal> fixed.

[18:03] <gaal> "error reading ./.setup-config; run "setup configure" command?"

[18:04] <gaal> that's a cabal thing, isn't it?

[18:07] <audreyt> it is

[18:07] <gaal> oh, I was having GHC errors before that.

[18:07] <gaal> sec.

[18:09] <audreyt> miyagawa: ping

[18:14] <audreyt> gaal: do so then

[18:15] <audreyt> as a backup in case we can't find .jp people :)

[18:15] <gaal> but I'd need to create one myself, as I have no Hebrew Tolkein

[18:16] <audreyt> hm, it's from Silmarillion, I wonder if there's a Hebrew translation for it

[18:17] <gaal> It's also in Book II of the Fellowship

[18:18] <gaal> I never read Tolkien in Hebrew, actually

[18:18] <putter> Elfish? http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/silmarillion_project.htm ;)

[18:19] <audreyt> oh, right, it's in FotR, not Silmarillion, I misremembered

[18:20] <audreyt> hm, I found one in .pl.

[18:20] <theorbtwo> Hmm, where is it?

[18:20] * szbalint got .hu version

[18:20] <szbalint> if needed. :)

[18:20] <theorbtwo> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/util/config_h.pl doesn't have it...

[18:20] <gaal> okay, it's not obvious how to do it (Hebrew has very different typical meter than English), so maybe for the next release. :-)

[18:21] <putter> anyone know how to say FotR in japanese?  google.jp ;)

[18:21] <audreyt> gaal: sure then, no worries :)

[18:21] <gaal> putter: google language tools says リングの団体

[18:22] <gaal> but that didn't paste very well did it :-)

[18:22] * gaal wonders what Magyar prosody is like

[18:22] <theorbtwo> Looks OK to me, assuming that's supposed to be 6 chars, and the second-from-last one is supposed to look like it's in a box...

[18:23] <gaal> theorbtwo: yes. your terminal fonts are obvisuly better than mine

[18:23] <szbalint> The interesting thing about the hungarian translation is that our ex president translated it while he was in prison in the communist era. :)

[18:23] <audreyt> szbalint: url? :)

[18:24] <gaal> wow! to Hebrew there are two xlations of The Hobbit, and the less accurate, more whimsical one was done by a group of pilots who were imprisoned in Egypt

[18:24] <szbalint> Which part is needed exactly? (Sorry, I'm not too familiar with pugs naming and quote conventions)

[18:25] <gaal> I wonder if there's a statistical significance here.

[18:25] <theorbtwo> I should think translation is a reasonbly common thing to do in prision.

[18:26] <theorbtwo> It doesn't require any potentionally hazordous materials or electricity.

[18:26] <theorbtwo> If all the materials can be picked up at any bookstore, it can't be used to set up even a monodirectional backchannel.

[20:01] <audreyt> / and come behind the Sun and light of Moon. 

[20:02] <szbalint> Yeah I noticed that the hungarian version had a few more lines extra too so I just figured someone truncated the english.

[20:02] <audreyt> that someone would be me

[20:03] <audreyt> I forgot why I did it ;)

[20:03] <putter> so what's with the "living flame"?  putter never read FotR.

[20:04] <shapr> who blithered past / and shopped with without restraint / and slept till past eleven / to vultch the trackless parking lots / and come behind on their visa bill

[20:04] * shapr does the barbie version...

[20:04] <szbalint> I think its better truncated, at least the .hu version is.

[20:05] <putter> lol

[20:05] <audreyt> shapr++ # but no way am I going to put this to Main.hs

[20:05] * shapr laughs

[20:05] <shapr> Good, barbie does not belong in Perl6.

[20:06] * putter tries to imagine a barbie pragma.  oh, maybe Barbie will be the successor to Blondie.

[20:06] <shapr> Monads are hard, let's go shopping.

[20:07] <putter> "Shopping is boring, let's play with monads!"

[20:07] <putter>  - Barbie c. 2008

[20:11] <szbalint> So maybe the .hu version at the release after this one?

[20:13] *** dduncan joined
[20:14] *** Amnesiac joined
[20:17] <shapr> putter: We could teach Barbie that monads allow her to sequence her shopping more effectively... she could find the best prices in the closest stores.

[20:17] <audreyt> szbalint: that depends on if miyagawa has a fix...

[20:17] <szbalint> Okay.

[20:18] <audreyt> miyagawa: ping? :)

[20:18] <miyagawa> pong :)

[20:18] <miyagawa> sorry I don't think I have a correct fix

[20:18] <miyagawa> because I've never read the LotR

[20:18] <miyagawa> :)

[20:18] <audreyt> that's cool then

[20:18] <audreyt> szbalint: please commit ahead to Main.hs and AUTHORS

[20:21] <szbalint> okay.

[20:22] <audreyt> cygwin looks good here.

[20:22] * audreyt reboots back to fbsd

[20:22] <audreyt> rafl: how's libparrot.so test doing?

[20:22] <rafl> audreyt: Currently running.

[20:22] <rafl> Only 1.4G centrino. It usually takes a while.

[20:23] <Juerd> "only"

[20:23] <Juerd> The CPU isn't the X4x's bottleneck. It's the hard drive.

[20:23] <rafl> It rarely does io currently. But the cpu is at 100%.

[20:25] <gaal> audreyt: i'm in t\pugsrun, so smoke ETA ~10 min

[20:26] <dduncan> now resyncing 8900 thru 8931

[20:26] <Juerd> rafl: Still, though, 1.4 is quite fast for a centrino.

[20:27] <szbalint> I hope I didn't mess something up.

[20:27] <rafl> audreyt: Ahh.. Could not find src/null_config.o in /tmp/buildd/parrot-0.4.1

[20:27] <Juerd> rafl: It maps roughly to a p4 2.4 

[20:27] <szbalint> First commit of mine :S

[20:27] <rafl> audreyt: Compiled it sucessfully but forgot to run makefile.PL first.

[20:27] <rafl> audreyt: Now it complains about the config.

[20:27] <audreyt> rafl: actually that's fine

[20:27] <audreyt> rafl: a sec

[20:28] <audreyt> rafl: try r8933

[20:28] <szbalint> *phew*

[20:29] <Juerd> szbalint: Congratulations with your first commit :)

[20:29] <szbalint> ty.

[20:29] <Juerd> szbalint: May many more follow :)

[20:29] <szbalint> Hopefully. :)

[20:30] <audreyt> rafl: the new Makefile.PL for libparrot worked for me

[20:30] <rafl> audreyt: For me as well. Thanks!

[20:30] <audreyt> excellent!

[20:30] <rafl> (at least Makefile.PL worked fine)

[20:30] <audreyt> try finishing make :)

[20:30] <audreyt> meanwhile I'll roll a -final tarball.

[20:31] * gaal wonders if there's any software that has a fully automated release process

[20:32] <putter> r8930 builds and passes sanity.

[20:32] <Juerd> PLP had it :P

[20:32] <gaal> PLP == ?

[20:32] <Juerd> But it cheated by not having any test suite

[20:32] <audreyt> heh

[20:32] <Juerd> gaal: Crap I once wrote.

[20:33] <Juerd> If you want to admire my perl skills anno 1999, 2000, have a look on CPAN

[20:33] <Juerd> It's still there. Someone else maintains it now.

[20:40] <putter> I assume including the  Pugs.sln   was intentional.

[20:41] <audreyt> yeah, as people with Visual Haskell may find it handy.

[20:45] <audreyt> Juerd: what was the context for this, though?

[20:46] <Juerd> audreyt: People here collectively wondered whether Perl 6 would have goto LABEL. An hour or so later, there's a very definitive, thorough message to that point in p6l.

[20:47] <audreyt> ok. I just got a mail from larry; he mentioned the Japanese translation seems poetic and reads nice

[20:47] <miyagawa> great

[20:47] <obra> nice

[20:47] *** nnunley joined
[20:48] <audreyt> however, we are going with Hungarian in this release, saving Japanese (and Polish, and Russian -- thanks to #ruby-lang) for the next versions

[21:03] <putter> building Pugs.Run took almost 10 cpu minutes, at 3GHz.

[21:04] <putter> checking...

[21:04] <audreyt> hm, did you build unoptimised?

[21:04] <audreyt> it could take longer

[21:04] <audreyt> than a normal (optimized) build

[21:04] <audreyt> for that single file

[21:05] <gaal> precompiled prelude + unompimized is teh terror

[21:06] <gaal> if precomp is still slow after yamlization we need to disable it after the release for unoptimized builds

[21:06] <audreyt> nod

[21:06] <audreyt> though the canonical answer is "we'll benchmark before doing anything"

[21:07] <dduncan> make of 8931 successful, and shell is fine

[21:07] <putter> ok, release sane.

[21:07] <audreyt> yay

[21:07] <gaal> putter: when I realized I forgot to vi config.yml I broke from make, and ran it again; that's a trick to get blib6 populated

[21:07] <gaal> whee

[21:07] <dduncan> now pulling thru 8933

[21:07] <putter> re relnotes, 

[21:07] <audreyt> putter: Run.hs still compiling? *mild discomfort*

[21:08] <putter> err, no, release candidate is sane (and the rules stuff seems to be ok to)

[21:08] <putter> re the relnotes,

[21:09] <putter> I suppose to it depends how much emphasis you want to put on the autrijis->audreyt transition.  " Now that I'm back to reality under a new-yet-original identity," could go or stay, depending on your objective.

[21:09] <dduncan> make of r8933 successful

[21:10] <dduncan> now, would I be best to smoke this, or download your pre2, build, and smoke that?

[21:10] <dduncan> the former would take 2 hours, the latter 3 if I'm lucky

[21:10] <putter> dduncan: there will likely be takeoff within the next few minutes.  probably best to smoke that.

[21:10] <gaal> dduncan: prove t/01-sanity ?

[21:10] <audreyt> dduncan: download the release tarball and play with it when you feel like :)

[21:11] <audreyt> putter: *nod* I'll mail it out as-is then

[21:11] <dduncan> okay, if you're actually releasing now, then I'll just smoke the one on cpan

[21:11] <audreyt> cool.

[21:11] <audreyt> okay. fly!

[21:11] * gaal cheers

[21:12] <putter> hmm, quick thought?

[21:12] <audreyt> putter: sure, but I've already sent out various things within the same 10 seconds

[21:17] <putter> everyone together now, "good night audreyt!"

[21:17] <gaal> putter: interesting you should use that phrase; Western Union just announced it's stopping it's telegram service.

[21:17] <putter> but thanks, it's been a blast.

[21:17] <audreyt> putter: sure... in OSDC.au I mentioned Pugs as my "pet" project that grew far beyond my imagination :)

[21:24] <gaal> I don't mean SMS--

[21:24] <gaal> --they get printed and delivered by courier.

[21:25] <dduncan> so what is Western Union for, if not delivering messages?

[21:26] <dduncan> or holding on to messages for 70 years for delivery

[21:26] <cdpruden> sending money

[21:26] <gaal> we can set up a telegram system in YAPC

[21:26] <gaal> oh wait no I don't know morse.

[21:27] <putter> ha, there's a source filter! :)

[21:28] <cdpruden> the morse code module on cpan was one of the first I pulled into pugs once the perl 5 support landed :)

[21:28] <gaal> dduncan: holing a message for 70 years!?

[21:28] <dduncan> you've seen Back to the Future, right?

[21:29] <dduncan> was that western union or some other agency?

[21:34] <dduncan> um, audreyt, hold that release for a minute

[21:34] <putter> oh, that's doesnt sound good.

[21:34] <integral> o_O

[21:34] <dduncan> I'm just checking the web, but on my disk the end of the changelog appears to be cut off mid-sentence

[21:35] <dduncan> around 6.0.8

[21:35] * integral sees that too on disk

[21:35] <gaal> :(

[21:35] <dduncan> like someone was using a bad editor

[21:35] <dduncan> that portion will have to be restored before this goes out

[21:35] <dduncan> I can do it

[21:35] <gaal> dduncan: I believe it has gone out.

[21:36] <putter> dduncan: restoring good.  but it's already out.  restoring is for next release. ;)

[21:36] <dduncan> its like someone using a crippled editor which is limited in memory opened that file, then resaved

[21:36] <svnbot6> r8935 | audreyt++ |   translations of the Main.hs poem.

[21:36] <gaal> but it's funny:

[21:36] <gaal> * Many Posix

[21:37] <putter> cdpruden: which morse code module?

[21:37] <gaal> as if it couldn't bring itself to say "posix impovements"

[21:37] <dduncan> ping audreyt ... has it actually gone out yet?

[21:37] <dduncan> or can we get a fix in?

[21:37] <audreyt> we can't, it's too late ;)

[21:37] <putter> dduncan: yes. no question. see backlog.

[21:37] <gaal> dduncan: it did, it did. see p6-{announce,compiler}

[21:38] <integral> appears to be r8916 that's at fault

[21:38] <audreyt> yup, apparently gnome's copy-paste has a buffer limit somewhere

[21:38] <dduncan> okay, all I saw was that you made a commit to say things are out

[21:38] <svnbot6> r8936 | audreyt++ | * restore changelogs before 6.0.8.

[21:39] <cdpruden> putter, think it was Convert::Morse.... I didn't understand the ~$1 stringify stuff when coming from regexps, and had troubles, but sort of worked :)

[21:39] <audreyt> dduncan: but it's not function breakage, so no 6.2.12 tonight :)

[21:39] <dduncan> I wasn't going to suggest that

[21:39] <dduncan> only that if 6.2.11 hadn't gone out yet, to hold for this

[21:40] <audreyt> *nod*

[21:40] <audreyt> thanks for noticing this :)

[21:40] * audreyt goes back to sleep &

[21:40] <dduncan> fyi, with my own distros, I mention as a changelog bullet when something like this happens in the changelog ... that is, an item for today mentions that items in the past were edited

[21:42] <dduncan> on that note, I'm going to add a template for 6.28.0 to the changelog now ... as I did with 6.2.11 and 6.2.10

[21:42] <putter> good thought.  and you can log the changlog change.

[21:43] <putter> this release, the sections were reordered, so the interesting stuff was at the top, and thus more likely to be read.

[21:46] <putter> cdpruden: well, if you have any questions...  Pity, one can do macro <...> { "s" }, but there are no whitespace macros yet, so you need to do a source filter to distinguish character from word breaks.  Oh well.

[21:46] * cdpruden squints and tries to understand that

[21:46] <putter> and I'm not sure how one deals with ".".

[21:46] <cdpruden> :)

[21:47] * shapr just squints

[21:48] <cdpruden> putter, maybe I wasn't saying it right -- but basically, I have things like this: q# when rx:P5/^$nick,\s*seen\s*(.*)\?$/ {   my $nick = ~$0;   # and just passing the $0 without ~ to a perl5 module gives it a match object (right?)  

[21:49] <cdpruden> putter, is there a better way to accomplish that?

[21:51] <cdpruden> Oh!  I see what you were saying, I think

[21:52] <dduncan> putter,

[21:52] <dduncan> do you want me to add that comment you quoted too?

[21:52] <putter> re question, i'm not sure what the "q# when " is?  and you are using $nick in the re, and then creating a new variable of the same name (which thus shaddows it) in a block?  huh?

[21:52] <dduncan> putter: this release, the sections were reordered, so the interesting stuff was at the top, and thus more likely to be read.

[21:53] <cdpruden> putter, sorry, meant to be cute with the q## to show that was just a quote

[21:53] <putter> oh, no need I think.

[21:53] <dduncan> I would actually add it under 6.2.11

[21:53] <cdpruden> wow, good catch... can't believe I still ahve that in there

[21:54] <dduncan> actually, for now I won't

[21:54] <putter> dduncan: the change log on a non-released non-production research project is a much more... flexible thing than in other contexts.

[21:54] <dduncan> mainly, despite its name, this changelog is more free form

[21:54] <dduncan> one reason I call mine 'Changes'

[21:55] <dduncan> ChangeLog sounds like the machine output of a cvs

[21:57] <putter> interesting idea
