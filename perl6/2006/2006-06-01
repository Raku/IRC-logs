[20:01] <szbalint> This may sound silly, but why does 'not' work at some places where '!' doesn't? I missed the difference between the two.

[20:04] <szbalint> (I've bumped into a test where !-d was changed to not -d)

[20:07] <Steve_p> szbalint:  There is a difference in operator precedence between ! and "not".

[20:08] <PerlJam> szbalint: They only differ in precedence, so maybe the place where ! doesn't work is a place where is applied to the wrong thing

[20:08] <PerlJam> (wrong relative to your expectation)

[20:14] <szbalint> I see, thanks...

[20:14] <szbalint> That's what I thought too after looking at S03 but I wasn't sure.

[20:31] <TimToady> szbalint: actually, I think that was changed because !-d showed

[20:31] <TimToady> a bug in the parser.

[20:31] <TimToady> so I moved the bug to one test and fixed the other tests to actually test the filetest rather than the parser.

[20:31] <szbalint> ah okay.

[20:32] <szbalint> I had a very old installation with lib.pm before

[20:32] <szbalint> that used !-d and for some reason was still around

[20:32] <TimToady> but either of them should work fine.

[20:33] <TimToady> "not" will work even better after we make it not a list operator

[20:33] <TimToady> but stacked unary operators don't really care about precedence at all.

[20:34] <TimToady> unless you happen to stack both a prefix and a postfix, then they have to negotiate

[20:34] <TimToady> with the default tables, however, all postfixes are tighter than all prefixes naturally

[20:34] <szbalint> so the parser bug got fixed in the meantime or is still around?

[20:35] <TimToady> dunno

[20:35] <Steve_p> Oh, yeah, not(()) caused some problems in Perl 5

[20:36] <TimToady> yes, it's a false economy to combine not's precedence into list ops.

[20:36] <szbalint> pugs -e 'my $dir = "ext"; if (!-d $dir) { say "no such dir" }' ## this still errors away, so I guess not

[20:39] <TimToady> The actual test for the bug is probably misplaced.  It's at the end of chmod.t:

[20:39] <TimToady> ok(try { !-e "nonesuch" }, "!-e syntax works", :todo);

[20:39] <Steve_p> Ohhh...
