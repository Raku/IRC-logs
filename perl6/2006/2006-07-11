[00:35] <Steve_p> For lack of a better term, its a prototype.

[00:56] <mugwump> List-Subscribe: <mailto:perl6-compiler-subscribe@perl.org>

[00:56] <mugwump> check that your envelope from matches your From:

[00:57] <mugwump> I have a vague recollection of that being required

[01:03] <mugwump> ivanfrey: are you getting bounces back?

[01:04] <mugwump> audreyt: what did you use to colorize your perl6 ?

[01:05] <ivanfrey> mugwump: I've got one bounce back, which I deleted. I've attempted to subscribe again, but it obviously isn't getting through so it'll get bounced when the retry period timesout.

[01:07] <ivanfrey> mugwump: maybe I'll setup a different identity in Thunderbird to handle this situation. So my From has to match the from on the envelope?

[01:08] <ivanfrey> When I'm in cpan interactive mode, the text is in a awful lime green colour.

[01:09] <mugwump> like I said, it's a vague recollection.  perhaps the bounce will be more informative.

[01:09] <mugwump> maybe you still have it, if you haven't compacted your mailbox?

[01:11] <ivanfrey> mugwump: I'll wait for the second bounce. I'm always compacting my Inbox.

[03:58] *** pingu is now known as cdhotpingu

[04:01] <nothingmuch> greetings

[04:01] <nothingmuch> i can't believe i just said that

[04:02] <audreyt> why not?

[04:02] <obra> could be worse

[04:02] <obra> you could have said 'gleetings'

[04:11] <ivanfrey> I'm still having problems building pugs. I try run ranlib on libHSpugs-HsSyck-0.1.a and libHSpugs-fps-0.7.a, but the make process just recreates them all over again.

[04:12] <ivanfrey> oh! My bad again the make process is probably copying it from the original in dist/build.

[04:18] <nothingmuch> because "greetings" is a geek greeting

[04:18] <nothingmuch> i try to be a little less "technical" than that

[04:18] <nothingmuch> you might as well say "i greet you"

[04:18] <nothingmuch> for me the how is important

[04:18] <nothingmuch> ;-)

[04:20] <obra> nothingmuch! I greet you!

[04:20] <nothingmuch> obra: hi!

[04:22] <ivanfrey> No, I ran ranlib on both copies ./third-party/HsSyck/dist/build/libHSpugs-HsSyck-0.1.a and ./third-party/installed/lib/pugs-HsSyck-0.1/libHSpugs-HsSyck-0.1.a, but I'm still requests to run ranlib on them.

[04:29] <ivanfrey> audreyt: I think I have to run those alternative setup commands which I have forgotten. Why does the build process quit with third-party/HsSyck/../installed/lib/pugs-HsSyck-0.1/libHSpugs-HsSyck-0.1.a and pugs-fps-0.7/libHSpugs-fps-0.7.a have no table of contents when I've run ranlib on them.

[04:30] <audreyt> ivanfrey: hm, check output from "make" on those two sections?

[04:31] <audreyt> ivanfrey: or give me a shell to debug

[04:31] <ivanfrey> I have mac os x.

[04:31] <ivanfrey> What username do you want?

[04:31] <audreyt> audreyt

[04:32] <audreyt> cp -Rf the entire pugs/ to my home

[04:32] <obra> I saw -Rf and did not see "cp"

[04:34] <aufrank> audreyt and ivanfrey: I've had this problem too.  my fix has been to open a second terminal and run ranlib on the libraries in thirdparty/installed/ as soon as they're generated

[04:34] <audreyt> wow

[04:35] <aufrank> I also have to do make under sudo because the install part of Setup.hs needs sudo priveleges

[04:35] <audreyt> and this is 6.4.2

[04:35] <audreyt> or 6.4.1?

[04:35] <ivanfrey> audreyt: in the mac os x case it's still 6.4.1.

[04:36] <aufrank> I'm osx 10.3.9 and ghc 6.4.1

[04:36] <aufrank> there's still a link on the ghc page that says binaries for osx for 6.4.2 are coming soon

[04:37] <ivanfrey> aufrank: Hey that's mine platform too.

[04:37] <aufrank> hooray for corner cases ;)

[04:38] <audreyt> ivanfrey: I think I fixed it

[04:39] <audreyt> try r1140

[04:39] <audreyt> 11430

[04:39] <ivanfrey> audreyt: You'll need a password on my system. I guess I'll need to generate a key so that you send your password to me encrypted

[04:39] <aufrank> audreyt: I dropped in and reported this sometime around preflight-0, but didn't stick around to see if it got worked on.  Happy coincidence that I'm here now :P

[04:39] <audreyt> ivanfrey: try it first :)

[04:39] <audreyt> aufrank: well, better late than never, etc :)

[04:39] <svnbot6> r11430 | audreyt++ | * build_pugs.pl: ranlib for third-party.

[04:40] <ivanfrey> audreyt: how do install 11430?

[04:40] <audreyt> ivanfrey: did you not have a subversion checkout of pugs?

[04:40] <audreyt> "svn up" in it will do

[04:40] <aufrank> audreyt: still with sudo make for cabal?

[04:40] <audreyt> if you don't, "svn co http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs" will get you one

[04:40] <lambdabot> Title: "Revision 11391: /"

[04:41] <audreyt> aufrank: try chown everything including ~/.ghc* to yourself

[04:41] <audreyt> aufrank: and try not run as root

[04:41] <audreyt> just "make"

[04:41] * audreyt sighs as this bug is already gone in GHC 6.4.2

[04:41] <audreyt> maybe I should take up the releng mantle from wolfgang for GHC-OSX.

[04:41] <audreyt> ...or maybe not.

[04:42] <aufrank> you've got a bleeding ghc on your macbook, eh?

[04:42] <audreyt> yeah, wouldn't run on macintel otherwise

[04:42] <aufrank> bleeding-edge, I guess I meant

[04:42] <audreyt> obra has a macppc

[04:42] <audreyt> so if forced I guess I can releng on that

[04:43] <audreyt> but first try the r11430 fix :)

[04:43] <audreyt> compiling GHC on this macbook is fine

[04:43] <aufrank> on it, but I won't have results for sure until this morning ;)

[04:43] <audreyt> on a G4... I don't look forward to it.

[04:43] <aufrank> I mean, tomorrow morning

[04:43] <audreyt> aufrank: "make optimized" is like 10x faster.

[04:43] <audreyt> er

[04:43] <ivanfrey> audreyt: do i have to rerun perl Makefile.PL?

[04:43] <audreyt> "make unoptimized"

[04:43] <audreyt> ivanfrey: prolly not

[04:43] <audreyt> just "make" again

[04:45] <ivanfrey> I have a G4 and I don't think make takes more than a hour. though I could be wrong.

[04:47] <obra>   audreyt also, I have a G5

[04:47] <obra> just with too little ram

[04:48] <ivanfrey> audreyt: make just failed again with those libraries. I'm running perl Makefile.PL.

[05:14] <audreyt> aufrank: it havn't been changed afaics

[05:15] <aufrank> I was partway through a build using my previous strategy when we started debugging

[05:16] <aufrank> audreyt: that is when I was running ranlib, it's in the right place

[05:17] <audreyt> so I suspect $ar isn't right

[05:17] <audreyt> or something. please help :)

[05:17] <aufrank> I can tell you that I had been doing sudo ranlib

[05:18] <aufrank> but I can't tell you if that was making a difference

[05:18] <audreyt> try and see?

[05:18] <audreyt> kinda hoping that you can tweak line 76 in utils/build_pugs until it works :)

[05:18] <audreyt> (and keep "make unoptimised")

[05:20] <aufrank> audreyt: I am not seeing line 79 in my output

[05:21] <aufrank> for either lib

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> archangle25 - this is a perl 6 channel, I think you probably want #perl

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> if you are using perl 5 - the answer is using POSIX 'strftime'

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> oh, oops

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> misread - if in perl5 - you probably want a regex and Time::Local

[13:55] <Limbic_Region> but really, this channel is for perl 6

[13:55] <archangle25> Limbic_Region, ty, but i made a booboo a while back and sent an amsg to my channels and got banned from #perl, how do i get unbanned!?

[13:57] <Limbic_Region> *shrug* - dunno, I have never made the mistake of getting banned

[13:57] <Limbic_Region> my guess would be to find someone willing to lobby on your behalf

[14:02] <Limbic_Region> here is something you can try - it works around the problem for me on Win32 though it is definately not a proper fix

[14:03] <Limbic_Region> copy the entire gcc-lib directory from your GHC root to your pugs root and try again (after a make realclean)

[14:04] <Limbic_Region> if it is the same problem - it will work

[14:04] <Limbic_Region> the reason being a recent change from using ghc in to util/runcompiler

[17:32] <nothingmuch> okay

[17:32] * nothingmuch will try to pay attention and see what actually happens

[17:32] <audreyt> the first 5 mins may feel uncomfortable (light coughing, etc) as your system is not used to it

[17:32] <audreyt> but it should be okay afterwards.

[17:32] <nothingmuch> okay

[17:33] <nothingmuch> any nausea involved?

[17:33] <audreyt> if any, very light, and only in the first few mins

[17:33] <audreyt> but YMMV

[17:34] <nothingmuch> yes

[17:34] * Limbic_Region has taken adderall before but isn't sure how close it is to ritalin chemically

[17:35] <audreyt> adderall is time-released but pretty much the same thing, iirc

[17:40] <stevan> ADD? where? ... sorry I was not paying attention

[17:40] <stevan> Limbic_Region: I am the same way, $work dictates that I context switch easily and frequently

[17:41] <nothingmuch> audreyt: Pod::Simple::Text is good for a base class?

[17:41] <svnbot6> r11456 | fglock++ | px/fglock/PCR - more tests

[17:41] <Limbic_Region> stevan - well, having read "Driven To Distraction" I realized that if I did have ADD, I always have had it and developed ways to balance it early on

[17:42] <SamB> I've ADD

[17:42] <stevan> Limbic_Region: I scored higher on the "Do you have ADD" test then most of all my exam scores in high school :)

[17:42] <Limbic_Region> though I almost did flunk out of HS, never matriculated into college, and have not been able to have a serious relationship until recently (we just had our 2 year anniversary)

[17:42] <Limbic_Region> stevan - is this one you get off the net or one administered by a psychological professional?

[17:42] <stevan> SamB: welcome :)

[17:42] <nothingmuch> SamB: audrey, stevan, Alias, ingy and shapr are all fairly certain I have ADD

[17:42] <stevan> Limbic_Region: admined by a pro :)

[17:42] <SamB> I dunno what "balance" means

[17:42] <nothingmuch> so i am trying ritalin to see if it makes me work better

[17:43] <nothingmuch> and if it does, i'll go see a doctor

[17:43] * Limbic_Region was rather peturbed by said individual when they wanted to just start treating me to "see what happens" without having administered such a test

[17:43] <audreyt> nothingmuch: yeah P::S::T

[17:43] <SamB> where are you that you can do it that way?

[17:43] <nothingmuch> since that is the logical way to do this stuff, especially with brain chemistry drugs ;-)

[17:43] <stevan> and if he has a seizure, I will take him to the hospital around the corner :)

[17:43] <stevan> Limbic_Region: it is heavily over-diagnosed these days

[17:43] <audreyt> ritalin at 10mg does _not_ induce seizure :)

[17:44] * stevan sees it more as an evolutionary step :)

[17:44] <audreyt> stevan: but seems to be a .us phenomenon

[17:44] <audreyt> in .tw it's heavily under-diagnosed

[17:44] <Limbic_Region> SamB - recognizing behavior and what causes it to go to extremes and then avoiding those behaviors (or doing more of something that has the same lessening effect)

[17:44] <stevan> audreyt: yes, very much so

[17:44] <stevan> we like our drugs and our status quo

[17:44] <SamB> the problem is the schools are bad enough here to induce ADD symptoms in people who don't normally have them

[17:44] <audreyt> I know ADD people who explained to the psychiartrist, over 3 attempts

[17:44] <Limbic_Region> for instance, some people with ADD do well with lists as they allow them to not try to keep them juggled in their mind while others don't - knowing which is which for you will go a long way to being happy

[17:45] <Daveman> Hello, all :)

[17:45] <audreyt> and finally the doctor reluctantly prescribed to him... Prozac.

[17:45] <stevan> ouch

[17:45] <audreyt> (which of course doesn't help.)

[17:45] <stevan> yes

[17:45] <stevan> I personally did not like ritalin

[17:45] <SamB> ooooooh, now I can be an ADD maniac!

[17:45] <stevan> it worked, and worked very well,.. but I prefer my brain the way it is

[17:45] <SamB> ... but its kind of depressing sometimes...

[17:46] <stevan> Daveman: ADD is the new acronym for MMD, just applied in the meat-space context

[17:46] <Limbic_Region> SamB - another example of developing a pattern of behavior to be healthier and happier for me involves not thinking after 7PM on nights I have to go to work the next day

[18:04] *** xdg joined
[18:06] <xdg> I have a question about the semantics of "say": Should "say" terminate statements with "\n" or (Perl5ish) "$\"?

[18:07] <PerlJam> xdg: The mailing list went over that a while back IIRC.

[18:07] <PerlJam> xdg: I don't remember the outcome, but I continue to think of say as terminating with a "\n"

[18:07] <integral> did both MLs go over it or just the p6 ones?

[18:08] <PerlJam> p6l would be the only place I'd notice it.

[18:08] <xdg> I mention it because I noticed that both Perl6::Say and IO::Handle (>1.23) use "\n"

[18:08] <audreyt> xdg: $/ is supposedly per-filehandle

[18:08] <TimToady> well, there is no $\ variable anymore, so that's part of it...

[18:08] <audreyt> xdg: but it's not yet implemented

[18:08] <TimToady> yes, such things should be per-filehandle attributes

[18:09] <xdg> But should say() respect that per filehandle?  Or is it assumed to always produce a local newline?

[18:10] <TimToady> newline is easier to teach.

[18:10] <xdg> -Oteach?

[18:11] <xdg> ;)

[18:11] *** Southen_ joined
[18:12] <xdg> The thought I had about $\ (or Perl6 equivalent per filehandle) is that it could be useful to shift to "\r\n" for sockets, etc. and continue to use "say"

[18:13] <TimToady> what you really want is a filehandle attribute that does s/\n/\r\n/g

[18:13] <TimToady> (only in Perl 6. :)

[18:15] * xdg makes a note to re-read synopses

[18:16] <TimToady> I doubt any of the synopses discuss that...

[18:16] <xdg> Thanks.  I was curious when I saw "\n" looking at code while trying to figure out why Perl6::Say was throwing warnings for redefining subs in IO::Handle.  (Whee!)

[18:17] *** Southen_ joined

[18:18] <xdg> TimToady: Most of my understanding of Perl6 syntax/semantics is still from listening to the audio of your Israel talk.  Eventually, I do want to get deeper than that.  (If my brain will hold it.)

[18:19] * Limbic_Region recommends xdg getting a Johnny Mnemonic upgrade

[18:21] <xdg> Limbic_Region: I've already dumped portions of my childhood it seems, and it doesn't appear to give me more capacity elsewhere, as my wife will attest.

[18:22] * Limbic_Region believes new hardware is required in addition to the dumping of prior wetware

[18:23] <xdg> That would explain it.

[19:22] <SamB> well...

[19:22] <SamB> its better than CVS, I'm sure

[19:23] <SamB> but I never would have attempted branching in CVS

[19:23] <SamB> especially not with all the bad things in the manual about it...

[19:23] <ajs> I do branching in CVS all the time. It's a pain, but workable

[19:37] <ajs> no problem. there are problems anyway

[19:37] <ajs> what's up?

[19:37] <ajs> or should I just read mail?

[19:37] *** jkanter joined
[19:38] <ajs> It turns out on re-reading Larry's comments in S29, he had already answered part of the each question... so I need to do a few things: implement what he arm-waved (a "longest but not infinite") and also make zip the one that returns an Iterator, not each. each returns lazy

[19:38] <ajs> Then at least it will match Larry's idea of each. I take no stand on how anyone feels about Larry ;)

[19:39] <PerlJam> ajs: So how does one tell zip when to stop?  It seems to me like you'd want to be able to do something like @x = zip(@a,@b,@c) but say "stop when @b runs out" or something

[19:39] <TreyHarris> PerlJam: yes, that's the point I'm making in mail, but now my attention is split :-)

[19:41] <ajs> PerlJam: There are three cases that I think are required to get that in any arbitrary case: Continue until all are exhausted (default); continue until longest non-infinite is exhausted (Larry's example); continue until shortest is exhausted (my example).

[19:41] <ajs> If you have all three, you can combine them with nested calls to zip/each that get you anything you like.

[19:42] <ajs> Though there might have to be some massaging to get zip/each to play nice (to get each to expand zip's tuples... that sounds so wrong)

[19:42] <PerlJam> Hmm. that sounds like putting the work onto the programmer when it could be simple syntactically.  @x = zip(@a,@b:stop_on_empty,@c);  (or somesuch)

[19:44] <ajs> Well, you're looking at what I consider to be the overly specific case. I think the general case is "I have N arrays, and I want to loop over them until some condition is met", no?

[19:44] <ajs> This seems rather ugly: @x = zip(@a:stop_on_empty,@b:stop_on_empty,@c:stop_on_empty)

[19:45] *** Khisanth joined
[19:45] <xerox> Eck.

[19:46] <ajs> I dunno... we might need BOTH. :stop_on_empty is probably too wordy, though.

[19:47] <pmichaud> seems to me as though zip deserves the adverb, not its arguments

[19:47] <pmichaud> @x = zip(@a, @b, @c, :stop_shortest)

[19:47] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . v

[19:48] <ajs> pmichaud: that doesn't work. You can't pass @a,@b,@c to a slurpy. Well you can, but you don't get what you wanted.

[19:49] <ajs> That would be @x = zip(:stop_shortest, @a;@b;@c) or @x = zip(@a;@b;@c, :stop_shortest)

[19:49] <ajs> They're both just passing the named parameter :$stop_shortest set to 1

[19:50] <PerlJam> ajs: so ... something like this?  @x = zip :{ $^a && $^b && $^c } @a, @b, @c

[19:50] <pmichaud> okay; I came in the middle of this, so...

[19:50] <pmichaud> just ignore me :-)

[19:50] <PerlJam> ajs: where zip continues as long as the block returns a true value

[19:50] <TreyHarris> ajs: heh, I should have paid attention here, not to my mail.  I just sent something rehashing all this.

[19:51] <ajs> TreyHarris: That's fine

[19:52] <TreyHarris> but yes, we need *three* things.  A boolean adverb to specify overall stopping behavior, a way to mark individual iterators as causing stoppage, and a way to mark individual iterators as not being considered in stoppage

[19:52] <ajs> PerlJam: Yes, except you need semis and we don't have a slurpy sub handy for that purpose yet.... it's arguable that that's the right way to go, but I'm not sure I want to add that level of complexity just yet

[19:53] <ajs> TreyHarris: Yes

[19:54] <kudra> goodnight

[19:54] <ajs> TreyHarris: I think it's two booleans (:fewest and :finite perhaps, though one permutation is redundant).

[19:55] <ajs> kudra: night

[19:55] <kolibrie> is there a way to tell if a pugs executable is built with embedded parrot or not?

[19:56] <ajs> And then you need a way to say "@a :fewest" which would do something... cause an exception to be thrown on "eof" from @a's iterator which zip/each catches?

[19:57] <ajs> And finally, the non-stoppage is probably the default

[19:57] <kolibrie> I tried to make a pugs without embedded parrot after making one with it, but without a make realclean, and I am doubting that the second one is reading from an external parrot

[19:58] <ajs> kolibrie: not sure.

[19:58] <kolibrie> The real problem I am investigating is why my examples/rules/yapc_schedule.pl works on feather and not locally

[19:58] <kolibrie> and thought it might be embedded parrot or not

[20:00] <ajs> TreyHarris: Thoughts?

[20:01] <ajs> I'm not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat, just trying to make sense of some edge cases.

[20:01] <ajs> kolibrie: Linux?

[20:02] <TreyHarris> ajs: I'm thinking...

[20:02] <ajs> TreyHarris: Cool

[20:03] <ajs> kolibrie: It just tells you what system calls are being made. Massive spew of output, but if it runs an external parrot, then you know it's talking to parrot

[20:03] <kolibrie> ajs: ooh, I could have used that a few times in the past

[20:04] <TreyHarris> ajs: roundrobin, on the other hand, needs to default differently.  roundrobin([1,2],[3],[4,5,6]) should generate 1,3,4,2,5,6, but should have an adverb that would case it to generate [1,3,4,2,undef,5,undef,undef,6]...

[20:05] <ajs> TreyHarris: So that's the inverse case. You need a :most for both the sub and the arrays.

[20:05] <ajs> er Containers

[20:06] <ajs> roundrobin probably does infinite by default though, so :finite still makes sense.

[20:06] <TreyHarris> I'm trying to fully grok this... would my three examples in my mail be doable?

[21:07] <Steve_p> ajs, you're going to get me called a liar again

[21:07] <ajs> He's the one that said, "You need to provide references. I'd accept anything authored by someone as qualified as Shlomi."

[21:07] <Steve_p> ;)

[21:07] <ajs> Steve_p: liar! ;)

[21:07] <FurnaceBoy> since the original *article* was 1) pretty daft and 2) by Shlomi, he wasn't going anywhere

[21:07] <nothingmuch> it's also very old

[21:07] <xerox> I don't like that article.

[21:07] <FurnaceBoy> would not accept any criticism that yes, it's as old as Stonehenge

[21:07] <FurnaceBoy> and about as relevant to perl6

[21:08] <xerox> Why doesn't it take in consideration Synopses in his very first paragraph?

[21:08] <ajs> The synopsis process may not have begun yet... it was 2004. When was the first synopsis?

[21:08] <nothingmuch> yeah, i think that's correct

[21:08] <nothingmuch> i think late 2004

[21:09] <xerox> Ah, it's old.

[21:09] <ajs> VERY

[21:09] <FurnaceBoy> yes, but refusing to listen to suggestions about revising it... that's where it got stupid

[21:09] <nothingmuch> or maybe mid 2004

[21:09] <nothingmuch> also, his perl 6 code in the article is very non perl6ish

[21:09] <FurnaceBoy> KDD, not shlomi, again... though it's not clear why shlomi hasn't revisited it (busy?)

[21:09] <nothingmuch> for 0..6 -> $t { if abs(@new[$t] - @new[$t+1]) > 3 {

[21:09] <nothingmuch> that should be a zip

[21:09] <ajs> FurnaceBoy: indeed. It's not that he was being stupid, just uninformed. But the observable difference between uninformed+stubborn and stupid are minimal.
