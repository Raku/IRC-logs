[11:59] <svnbot6> r14936 | masak++ |   and/or mercilessly refactor to make more perl6ish as you see fit.

[12:00] <masak> btw, is there anything I need to do or add to declaim ownership to that piece of code?

[12:00] <masak> I don't want people to be afraid of modifying it because they think it belongs to someone

[12:01] <masak> anyway, it was a fun problem

[12:05] <gaal> code has "please hack" bit on by default. if you want something more yours, you can add a comment inline or move it to misc/pX

[12:30] <perlchina> no, I'm a chinese guy

[12:30] <masak> right

[12:31] <perlchina> Christmas is not my own festival

[12:32] <perlchina> many chinese people celebrating Christmas

[12:32] <masak> oh

[12:37] <masak> ayrnieu: definitely

[12:37] <perlchina> your chinese is very good

[12:37] <masak> so, perlchina, are you interested in perl6 too?

[12:37] <perlchina> yes

[12:38] <masak> hen hao

[12:38] <masak> what do you know about it?

[12:38] <perlchina> yes 

[12:38] <ayrnieu> masak - be sure to tell your class about http://www.blogchina.com/ , http://www.bokee.com/ , and especially http://podcast.bokee.com/

[12:38] <masak> ayrnieu: I will

[12:39] <masak> anything that helps Chinese learning is good

[12:39] <perlchina> say chinses any where

[12:40] * ayrnieu reads chuangren xiaoshuo to get better :-)  :-/  (please don't tell anybody)

[12:40] * masak really needs to install those fonts, though

[12:40] <masak> ayrnieu: what's that?

[12:40] * masak is a bit new to Chinese culture

[12:40] <ayrnieu> masak - erotic fiction.

[12:41] <masak> ayrnieu: :)

[12:41] <masak> I can see how that might motivate understanding

[12:42] <ayrnieu> hah, manhua and movies and games from yesasia.com also go well.

[12:44] * masak is unable to find "chuangren" in any dictionay

[12:44] <ayrnieu> perlchina - ni faxian perl6 de wenti, wen ba.

[12:45] <ayrnieu> oh, 'chengren'

[12:45] <masak> thx

[12:49] <masak> ah, "cheng" as in "accomplish"/"reach". "chengren" translates as "adult"

[12:49] <perlchina> wo mei faxian shenme wenti

[12:53] <masak> perlchina: best way to find things you want to ask about

[12:54] <masak> is to try write something in Perl6

[12:54] <masak> have you donwloaded pugs?

[12:54] <masak> it's fun to play with

[12:55] <masak> & # food

[12:55] <perlchina> today, only want to know how to use irc

[13:02] <ayrnieu> you can say  /me action  , and you can say  /quit  --- everything else of importance, you've already accomplished.

[14:18] <nothingmuch> no other way really

[14:18] <nothingmuch> except FOAF... but then I assume you wouldn't ask

[14:21] <MonkeyKing> jobs.perl.org don't have enough information 

[14:24] <Juerd_> Then you are out of luck.

[14:25] <Juerd_> Spamming IRC won't work. It'll only make matters worse for you.

[14:43] <masak> Juerd_: oops, I means /msg

[14:44] <masak> Juerd_: /say is really almost a no-op, sending the text to the room

[14:50] <ayrnieu> /say doesn't exist in IRC, but IRC clients offer it to, e.g., send messages to a channel that begin with '/', which most clients otherwise treat specially.

[15:01] <masak> ayrnieu: exactly. hence "almost" a no-op :)

[15:42] <Juerd_> /say is also provided for scripting and aliasing

[15:43] <Juerd_> As for sending things that begin with "/": many clients allow a prefix of "/ " to escape it.

[15:43] <Juerd_> /foo

[15:43] <Juerd_> ^^ "/ /foo"

[15:43] <ayrnieu> many of them do that?
