[12:49] <lambdabot> You don't have any new messages.

[12:50] <dmq> anybody care to offen an opinion on whether the pattern in this code should match? :  $str="abcdef"; pos($str)=1; $str=~/.\G(..)/g

[12:52] <nothingmuch> @tell audreyt MO::Compile::Abstract::Classs isgetting a sub filter_composition_failures {

[12:52] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[12:53] <nothingmuch> @tell audreyt this is used at the latest possible time (constructing responder interfaces) to die on conflicts... this works with a new role, MO::Compile::CompositionFailure, which provides a method is_composition_failure (Attached items delegate this)

[14:13] <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search

[14:14] <gaal> durn. surely there's golfage to apply to:

[14:14] <gaal> return $ if somecond then Nothing else Just something

[14:19] <gaal> this and the varaint with somecond negated occur a few times. I wonder what's a good name though.

[14:20] <gaal> condMaybe maybe?

[14:20] <gaal> anyway, I don't know why this is broken:

[14:20] <gaal> brrr

[14:20] <gaal> stack overflow, anyway.

[14:21] <gaal> .oO(why did I make emit_yaml unsafe?)

[14:24] <avar> yaml should not be unsafe..

[14:24] <avar> don't you mean the syntax tree?

[14:24] *** Daveman joined
[14:29] *** kisu joined
[14:47] <gaal> avar: emit_yaml isn't .yaml; yes, it emits the syntax tree in yaml form

[14:47] <gaal> like :D in the interactive pugs but yamlized

[14:47] <gaal> i suppose we have a bug in hssyck for recursive structures

[14:47] <gaal> will track later today
