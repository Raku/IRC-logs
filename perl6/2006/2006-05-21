[15:39] <shachaf> synergy is a software KM switch.

[15:39] <shachaf> Oops, wrong channel.

[15:41] <azuroth> synergy is what happens when two or more components come together to produce an effect that neither one of them alone could achieve

[22:01] <wolverian> hm, epigram is neat

[22:01] <wolverian> (also horrifying)

[22:01] <obra> epigram?

[22:01] <wolverian> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigram_programming_language

[22:02] <obra> Thanks

[22:05] <ajs_home> wolverian: Very similar to Fortress in some ways [[Fortress programming language]]

[22:06] <wolverian> hmm. yeah, I guess. I'll have to reread about Fortress

[22:06] <wolverian> thanks :)

[22:44] <wolverian> TimToady, does autoindex work with enums? do { take new Card: rank => $^rank, suit => $^suit }

[22:45] <wolverian> (where rank and suit are enums)

[22:48] <ludan> bye

[22:48] *** ludan left
[22:48] <wolverian> TimToady, (the block is meant to generate a standard deck)

[23:31] <root4o> hi

[23:32] <root4o> does perl6 has something like assert() in java ?

[23:34] *** kanru joined
[23:34] <mugwump> die if () ?

[23:35] <root4o> yes, but in java u may not compile them inside the resulting bytecode

[23:35] <root4o> and have it only in debuging version of your program

[23:36] <root4o> i.e. no runtime overhead

[23:36] <mugwump> you can use macros for that sort of thing

[23:37] <root4o> i see. 10x

[23:37] <mugwump> assert() is basically a macro

[23:38] <root4o> as u said it...i figured out

[23:38] <mugwump> except for the case where you are asserting the type of something... in that case you only really want the compiler to remove the check once it has proven that there may be no code that is generated that can violate that check

[23:39] <mugwump> eg, subroutine signatures are assertions

[23:39] <root4o> aha..yep
