[19:12] <TreyHarris> anyone heard from audreyt since the earthquake?

[19:15] <gaal> there was an earthquake? :(

[19:16] <allbery_b> which one?

[19:16] <TreyHarris> http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/world/asia/26cnd-taiwan.html

[19:17] * allbery_b heard of two recently, largeish one near taiwan and smallish near japan

[19:17] <TreyHarris> well, audreyt lives in taipei

[19:18] <TreyHarris> http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqinthenews/2006/uswtai/

[19:18] *** Lorn_ joined
[19:20] <miyagawa> I don't think we had any big one in Japan

[19:22] <ingy> audreyt is in the north of taiwan. I don't think it was so big of a deal there

[19:22] <TreyHarris> really, i thought she was in taipei

[19:22] <allbery_b> a 4.1 was reported near japan a couple days ago.  don't think it did much of anything

[19:22] <TreyHarris> oh, north

[19:22] * TreyHarris laughs

[19:23] <TreyHarris> I get my left and right confused, but now I'm confusing my north and south....

[19:23] <miyagawa> Taipei (台北) means North of Taiwan

[19:24] <miyagawa> apparently the quake is centered on the south Taiwan

[19:24] <miyagawa> 台南 (Tainan)

[19:25] <miyagawa> So if she lives in Taipei, it's away from the quake. At least I hope so

[19:26] <ingy> she lives almost in Taipei, there is really nothig to worry about afaict

[19:28] *** ofer0 joined
[19:29] <audreyt> I didn't even feel the quake

[19:29] <lambdabot> audreyt: You have 11 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[19:30] <audreyt> in fact I was just about to sleep -- it's 3:30am here :)

[19:30] <audreyt> people in taipei city (i.e. inside the basin) reported that it was noticeable but nothing to worry about

[19:30] *** silug joined
[19:30] <audreyt> as I live on the mountains in the taipei county now, there's even less to worry about :)

[19:31] <miyagawa> good to hear that.

[19:31] <TreyHarris> Well good, i'm glad.  I heard "southwest of Taiwan" and visualized a dot up and to the right, somewhere near Taipei.  Sometimes my geographic sense gets reversed like that....

[19:32] <audreyt> TreyHarris: but really, much gratitude for caring about my well being :)

[19:32] <TreyHarris> :)

[19:37] <gaal> yo. I have a new module I'd love y'all to review :)

[19:37] <Tene> what is it?

[19:37] <gaal> uploading, sec

[19:38] <gaal> it's a ... transparent factory! :)

[19:38] <audreyt> as for well-being: I've been on extremely high level of phenethylamines and norepinephrine lately, but as of this week I've attained a more regular vasopressin and endorphin level; the latter chemicals are less contradictory to hacking, I hear, so that's good news :-)

[19:38] <ingy> I just got the weirdest email

[19:38] * audreyt waves and sleeps &

[19:39] <ingy> Dec 26 Stacy Sheppard  (  22) Future Inline Development

[19:39] <b_jonas> a transparent factory... that reminds me to Charlie and the chocolate factory

[19:39] <ingy> the body of the email is:

[19:39] <ingy> Brian???

[19:39] <gaal> mmmm, transparent chocolate

[19:39] <ingy> that's it... wtf?

[19:40] <allbery_b> either some spammy graphic or some virus autodeleted?

[19:40] <allbery_b> otherwise it's probably intended to to fuzz spam-detecting Bayes networks

[19:42] <gaal> or just a probe

[19:43] <ingy> It had to be a personal email

[19:44] *** larsen_ joined
[19:44] <ingy> referring to Inline Development and Brian seems unlikely

[19:44] <gaal> http://perlcabal.org/~gaal/tmp/Class-TransparentFactory-0.01.tgz

[19:44] <ingy> as something generated

[19:44] <gaal> maybe Stacy was like

[19:44] <gaal> OMG Brian!!!11 my code is SO SHORT NOW that I use Inline. How did you DO IT?

[19:45] <TreyHarris> ingy: i get spam with meaningless snippets of perl6-language and perl6-users sometimes.

[19:45] <gaal> anymoose, comments very welcome on that distro; the perldoc oughta explain it enough!

[19:45] <TreyHarris> they're smart enough to analyze what mail you get based on public list archives

[19:46] <gaal> anyone remember how to prevent closures installed in symtables from having ANON names in (caller($x))[3] ?

[19:46] <gaal> I thought I saw some technique to fix it but I don't remember what it was :(

[19:49] <gaal> ah, there's Sub::Name, but that isn't pure Perl

[19:50] *** penk joined
[19:57] *** bonesss joined
[20:00] <b_jonas> gaal: wasn't it something like assigning to *ANON?

[20:01] <b_jonas> gaal: your url gives 404 btw

[20:07] <gaal> oops, http://perlcabal.org/~gaal/tmp/Class-TransparentFactory-0.01.tar.gz

[20:13] <gaal> b_jonas: anyway, I don't see *ANON anywhere in perldoc?

[20:14] <b_jonas> gaal: I think it's undocumented

[20:14] <b_jonas> or at least I didn't see it documented anywhere

[20:14] <gaal> so, how to use it?

[20:15] <gaal> *{mypkg::myfunc} = sub { *ANON = "myfunc"; ... } ?

[20:15] <gaal> doesn't look right..

[20:15] <gaal> *{"..."} that is

[20:38] <kudra> hi

[20:41] <b_jonas> hi

[20:42] * kudra is amazed to find one person who isn't idle today.

[20:42] <kudra> Seems like everyone's away.

[20:42] <kudra> On every channel.

[20:43] <gaal> kudra: moose!

[20:43] <kudra> gaal! *hugs*

[20:43] <gaal> I finished the book today

[20:43] <kudra> I'm actually on #moose also.

[20:43] <gaal> I'm actually a moose also.

[20:43] <Caelum> book?

[20:44] <gaal> sorry, off-topic :)

[20:44] <kudra> How did you like it?

[20:44] <gaal> was great! :)

[20:44] * stevan grabs a cup of coffee and sits down

[20:44] * allbery_b is around but has little to say

[20:44] <stevan> I hope I am not too late for Book group!

[20:45] <gaal> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerman_telegram, the Tuchman reference

[20:45] * kudra is guessing Stevan did not read the assigned book.

[20:45] * stevan fumbles for his Cliff Notes

[20:45] <allbery_b> (upgrading one home box, backing up others, whee)

[20:45] <gaal> stevan: the wikipedia article is a nice summary of the caper, but the book is in fact a good read

[20:46] <stevan> gaal: that link is not coming up

[20:46] <gaal> s/,$//

[20:46] <stevan> ah

[20:47] <kudra> short summary: it's a book about the Zimmerman telegram, which was sent by Germany to Mexico via the US and offered to support Mexico if they attacked the US.

[20:47] <kudra> This was prior to US entry in to WWI.  The British decrypted the telegram, and then managed to get it leaked to the Americans

[20:48] <gaal> "The telegram was intercepted and decrypted enough to get the gist of it by codebreakers Nigel de Grey, William Montgomery and Admiral William R. Hall of the British Naval Intelligence unit, Room 40. This was made possible because the code the Foreign Office used (0075) had been partially cryptanalyzed [...]"

[20:48] <gaal> weird, because the book claims it was a code, not a cypher, and the number was different.

[20:48] *** ofer0 joined
[20:48] <gaal> ah, later they say: "The cable to Washington was in code 7500, a newer, more difficult code"

[20:48] <kudra> Gaal: you read it more recently than I did, so I was probably wrong to call it a crypt.

[20:49] <gaal> hee, the article suffers from endianity :)

[20:49] <kudra> oh, you refer to the article.

[20:49] <gaal> *nod*

[20:50] <kudra> I guess I should return your book soon.  Is there anything else I can loan you?

[20:50] <stevan> so is this non-fiction? or historical fiction?

[20:51] <kudra> non-fiction

[20:51] * stevan promises to read the next book ;)

[20:51] <kudra> I was given 5 books for Christmas.

[20:51] <kudra> but I'm not sure you would be interested in reading any of them.

[20:52] <stevan> books++

[20:52] <gaal> kudra: no rush and nothing in particular, thanks :)

[20:53] <kudra> stevan: send me your copy

[20:53] * gaal is getting into the habit of recommending http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_And_Commander to everyone

[20:54] <gaal> surprisingly excellent writing

[20:54] <kudra> gaal: I don't know enough about your tastes to suggest anything.  Hav eyou read 'Ombolov'?  The book you loaned me for some reason reminded me of that book.

[20:54] <kudra> I must admit, that doesn't look like my kind of a book ('Master and Commander').  But if you loan it to me, I'll read it ;)

[20:55] <gaal> I don't own the copy I used, alas, and I already returned it

[20:55] * kudra actually popped on to irc to see if there was anyone in the UK who could pick her up something (not a book).

[21:02] <qmole> what are you after?

[21:02] <kudra> Oh, just looking for anyone I know from the UK to pick up something and mail it to me.

[21:05] <kudra> Not that important.  I can order it online, I just wanted it sooner so I could give it to someone.
