[02:15] <wolverian> miyagawa, ping.

[02:20] <dduncan> fyi, if anyone wants to see where I appear in that new movie, see http://darrenduncan.net/tempxd1.jpg

[02:20] <wolverian> dang! I was sure you'd be the hairy dude

[02:20] <dduncan> the file will only be up for a few days, and don't link to it or post it on any web site ... no Google archives

[02:21] <dduncan> nah

[02:21] <QtPlatypus> What movie is that dduncan ?

[02:21] <dduncan> what just came out yesterday?

[02:22] <dduncan> and starts with an 'x'

[02:22] <QtPlatypus> Arh!

[02:23] <dduncan> I first reported this fact last august, though that turned out to not be such a good idea

[02:23] <QtPlatypus> Why not?

[02:23] <dduncan> now that its come out, I don't have to keep quiet

[02:23] <dduncan> apparently I wasn't supposed to talk about my being in the movie

[02:23] <dduncan> before it came out

[02:23] <dduncan> even though I didn't spoil anything

[02:24] <dduncan> the image was from the Dec 2005 trailer, several months later

[02:25] <dduncan> but I didn't start showing people the image until today

[02:25] <QtPlatypus> So basically it was a nondisclosure clase.

[02:25] <dduncan> yes

[02:26] * QtPlatypus nods

[02:26] <dduncan> I thought that what I signed was "don't spoil what happens in the movie", but it actually said "don't even say you were in it at all"

[02:26] <QtPlatypus> Congratulations.

[02:27] <dduncan> well, I've liked the source material for a long time, and the movie was being filmed where I live, so I was happy to be in it

[02:28] <dduncan> of course, I have no intention to become famous that way

[02:28] <dduncan> if I get any fame, it should be from something Perl related

[02:28] <miyagawa> wolverian: pong

[02:29] <wolverian> miyagawa, I have a FOAF aggregator plugin for Plagger. want it? :)

[02:29] <miyagawa> cool

[02:29] <wolverian> I am there, I think

[13:46] <audreyt> pong

[13:47] <szbalint> Hey, I was wondering if you could tell be about the current state of OO/class/role support?

[13:48] <szbalint> I was looking in t/, although some tests seem to pass although marked todo

[13:49] <szbalint> *-although

[13:50] <audreyt> currently classes are supported without a metaobject protocol (.meta)

[13:50] <audreyt> roles are not supported; they are emulated as classes.

[13:52] <szbalint> Are there any plans to progress that area a bit, in the next few months or so?

[13:52] <Juerd> audreyt: Could you mention the $1000 thing in your journal? :)

[13:54] <audreyt> szbalint: yes.

[13:54] <szbalint> Cool. That'll come handy

[13:55] <audreyt> Juerd: would help if you write a summary under docs/journal or something :)

[13:55] <szbalint> Thanks, audreyt :)

[23:48] <dduncan> general question ... what is the current state of various meta-class functionality in Pugs?

[23:49] <dduncan> eg, can I dynamically build a class specification from user data?

[23:51] <dduncan> also, is it possible to obtain something akin to an .id from a class, so that it is otherwise possible to compare 2 class definitions to see if they are fully or partially the same aside from their names?

[23:51] <dduncan> something with similar ease to being able to compare 2 different shaped hashes to see if they have the same keys and/or dimensions?

[23:51] <dduncan> shaped or ordinary hashes

[23:52] <dduncan> I assume that is partly what the whole meta-class concept is for, so I can introspect and/or construct any normal class dynamically
