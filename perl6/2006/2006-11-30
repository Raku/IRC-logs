[15:51] <Tene> So, has Net::IRC::OO ever worked at all?

[15:52] <Tene> There's some stuff in here that just looks kind of strange.

[15:53] *** hexmode joined
[16:03] *** xinming joined
[16:03] <audreyt> I don't think it ever worked, no :)

[16:05] <Tene> 'kay, this makes more sense now.

[16:05] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - you are aware of the test that hangs (forever) preventing smokes from completing right?

[16:05] <audreyt> no, please flunk them as appropriate

[16:06] <Limbic_Region> explain flunk

[16:06] *** KingDiamond joined
[16:06] <Limbic_Region> the test is documented to hang

[16:06] <audreyt> Test::flunk() is unconditional failure

[16:06] <Limbic_Region> t/perl5/modify_inside_p5_p6.t

[16:06] <Limbic_Region> heh

[16:06] <audreyt> so comment it out and flunk it for now?

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> I wasn't even thinking of flunk in terms of "I flunked a test" but as some jargon that meant something I didn't understand

[16:07] <Tene> It runs now, but eats 100% cpu.

[16:07] <audreyt> the ADSL people finally figured things out; I'll have proper net next week, hurray.

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> wooot

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> Tene - I assume you are talking about Net::IRC::OO and not the test I am talking about?

[16:08] <Tene> You are correct.

[16:09] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - what is the prototype for flunk()

[16:10] <Limbic_Region> sub flunk (Str $desc?, :$todo, :$depends) returns Bool is export {

[16:10] <Limbic_Region> nevermind - found it

[16:12] <Limbic_Region> ok, uploading now

[16:13] <svnbot6> r14855 | Limbic_Region++ | Per audreyt++ flunking this test so smokes do not hang

[16:17] *** avar joined
[16:20] <Tene> One problem here is very strange...

[16:21] *** AkonD joined
[16:22] *** rgs is now known as aigrrgs

[16:23] <Tene> class Net::IRC::OO has Str $.nick is rw.

[16:23] <Tene> submethod BUILD has Str $.nick in the prototype

[16:23] <Tene> but if I try to refer to $.nick inside of BUILD, I get *** No compatible subroutine found: "&nick"

[16:25] <TimToady> you must use $!nick in a BUILD, not $.nick.

[16:25] <TimToady> BUILD routines should not be calling virtual methods.

[16:26] <Tene> Oh, right.  I was just reading that in the spec, but didn't make the connection...

[16:26] <TimToady> on the other hand, I'm not sure that part of the spec is implemented, so something else might be going on...

[16:26] <TimToady> can't tell until my pet peeve gets fixed...

[16:26] <Tene> and what is that?

[16:27] <TimToady> every time it says "No compatible subroutine found" I want to ask "compatible with what?"

[16:28] <Tene> the trivial test case submethod BUILD (Str $.foo) { $.foo.say;} works without problem.

[16:29] *** araujo joined
[16:30] <Tene> I can't see the difference... yet.

[16:35] <TimToady> something to do with the rw probably.

[16:36] <Tene> Maybe.

[16:36] <Tene> using $!nick works, though.

[16:37] <TimToady> maybe the rw makes it autogen a different method that hides the one that works.

[16:37] *** rhizo joined

[16:42] <TimToady> is there a derived class involved?  that could slurp up a virtual method away from this class.

[16:42] <TimToady> and then fail to bind properly

[16:43] *** buetow joined
[16:45] *** dmq joined
[16:45] <Tene> No, no derived classes.

[16:48] <Tene> I'll look at it a bit more after I get this cleaned up a bit.
