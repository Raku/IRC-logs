[08:34] <txg> Hi! Anybody home?

[08:36] <txg> I just found out that in perl 6 regexp's the [...] will not define a group of characters anymore. How can I do this (i.e.: define a group of chars to be matched) in Perl 6?

[08:37] *** KingDiamond joined
[08:37] <txg> <[...]>

[08:37] <txg> got it

[08:50] <gaal> re: var export. first, I think we shouldn't be using a Perl-accessible node on %*INC to store stuff, because most of the time the stuff we are storing there isn't meaningful to the P6 code.

[08:50] <gaal> second, I don't know what to put there for variables, unless it's the TVar itself

[08:51] <gaal> in which case point A is strengthened (this is not something P6land should see)

[08:52] <gaal> but also, the way we arrange for varibles to be created must change, because we need to reduce part of the creation -- enough to call newTVar -- immediately upon parsing

[08:53] <gaal> What is the correct set of possible export providers?

[08:53] <gaal> That is, if I request an import from X, what can X be?

[08:54] <gaal> The global (ugh) store of exportables must be keyed by Xs

[19:58] <gaal> if anything looks relevant

[19:58] <efunneko> Not much else looks relevant.

[19:59] <efunneko> I will grab some more ...

[19:59] <gaal> well, in a pinch, try turning off parrot embedding. 

[19:59] <efunneko> I tried with and without parrot.

[19:59] <efunneko> I did see this problem reported in some #perl6 logs from a week ago

[20:00] <efunneko> Unfortunately, Audrey just logged into the guys box and it worked for him.  Perhaps something with my shell?

[20:00] <efunneko> I did have 6.2.9 running previously.

[20:00] <gaal> what parrot version do you have?

[20:01] <efunneko> parrot 0.4.1

[20:01] <gaal> though, come to think of it, it sounds like a problem in the .hsc file, not anything in parrot

[20:02] <efunneko> Seems that way.  I tried to manually run hsc2hs and it didn't seem to have a problem, but this just caused a problem later.

[20:04] <gaal> cpan tarball or head?

[20:04] <efunneko> I actually tried both with the same result

[20:04] <gaal> hmm. sorry, worksforme and I can't think of anything :(

[20:04] <efunneko> Separate directories - the svn one had previously built in the 6.2.10 timeframe.

[20:05] <efunneko> Would "ghc-pkg: cannot find package plugins"  mean anything (prints this when `perl Makefile.PL`)

[20:11] <gaal> nothing relevant, no.

[20:11] <efunneko> oh well.  Thanks for your time.  

[20:12] <gaal> np, ask again later

[20:12] <efunneko> Will do.  I will do some reading to try to understand what is failing.

[20:13] <cognominal> hum, what is pil-n exactly?

[20:13] <gaal> thanks for the repory

[20:13] <cognominal> it is an intermediate representation?
