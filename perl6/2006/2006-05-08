[00:00] <aufrank> specifically, if there are some params that are shared across different invocants, can that be declared with tiebreakers?

[00:00] <audreyt> aufrank: S06, Invocant parameters

[00:00] <audreyt> aufrank: give an example?

[00:01] <audreyt> putter: er no. separate compilation.

[00:01] <audreyt> putter: the compiler for a file always start from a clean state.

[00:01] <audreyt> so the only way to influence parsing is by explicit 'use' and import from _that file_.

[00:02] <aufrank> I'm in there now... there aren't any examples that use ( Str $a, Int $b : Num $b, Str $c : Set $d ) as you were describing yesterday

[00:02] <audreyt> and indeed it's gone from the Synopses.

[00:02] <aufrank> by design?

[00:02] <audreyt> I don't know.

[00:02] <audreyt> sec

[00:03] <audreyt> see dconway's reply at http://www.codecomments.com/archive312-2005-5-503396.html

[00:03] *** ruoso joined
[00:04] <audreyt> hm.

[00:04] <audreyt> it gets infinitely simpler if we just have one tiebreaking level.

[00:05] <audreyt> otoh, multilevel is useful to implement left-to-right instead of manhattan-distance tiebreaking.

[00:05] <putter> so unknown idents default to prelist, and ref() works because it's in the prelude?

[00:05] <audreyt> otgh, what's not specced does not exist

[00:06] <audreyt> TimToady: multilevel tiebreaking. not specced. intentional? :)

[00:06] <audreyt> putter: yes and yes.

[00:06] <audreyt> putter: I imagine some day you can say

[00:06] <audreyt> use Prelude <explicit list of things>

[00:06] <audreyt> and kill the parts that you don't want

[00:06] <audreyt> (same as in Hs)

[00:06] <putter> k

[00:07] <wolverian> except we don't have hiding, do we?

[00:07] <audreyt> we don't.

[00:08] <aufrank> as for my specific question, how about something like `multi sub apply_labels ( Set $unlabeled: @labels ) { ... };  multi sub apply_labels ( @unlabeled: @labels ) { ... };`

[00:08] <audreyt> wolverian: otoh, if we say it accepts the Exporter spec of p5's

[00:08] <audreyt> use Prelude <!ref>;

[00:08] <audreyt> ought to do it.

[00:08] <aufrank> both versions of the multi share a non-inv parameter

[00:08] <aufrank> could you declare the two inv variations and the non-inv parameter all in one sig?

[00:09] *** macroron__ joined
[00:09] <audreyt> aufrank: but if it's in one sig, how do you know if it's a Set?

[00:10] <audreyt> multi app ( Set|Array $moose: @labels ) { ... }

[00:10] <audreyt> does what you want, probably

[00:10] <aufrank> is that the same as `multi ( Set $unlabeled : @unlabeled : @labels ) { ... } ?

[00:11] <aufrank> whatever's after the last colon is the non-inv part of the signature?

[00:12] <audreyt> if there is a colon, yes.

[00:12] <audreyt> otherwise all params are taken to be inv

[00:13] <audreyt> and no, it's not the same

[00:13] <audreyt> Set|Array on the input param means that it can be satisfied by either a Set or an Array

[00:13] <audreyt> and you'll have to use operations common to Set and Arrays to guarantee safety

[00:13] <audreyt> until you do a typecasing

[00:14] <aufrank> ok, I think I get it

[00:14] <audreyt> cool. also, if multilevel tiebreaking is gone, then you don't have to parse multiple colons anymore

[00:15] <putter> ;)

[00:15] <audreyt> though I suspect left-to-right tiebreaking may have some real uses.

[00:16] <aufrank> rule multi_sig { [ <single_sig> \: ]* <single_sig> } # any chance this is close?

[00:16] <audreyt> (I just linked to andreas loh's paper on bringing "multi" and open data types to Hs)

[00:17] <audreyt> # http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~loeh/OpenDatatypes.pdf

[00:17] <audreyt> aufrank: that looks fine

[00:17] <audreyt> though maybe

[00:17] <audreyt> rule multi_sig { <single_sig> [ \: <single_sig> ]* }

[00:18] <audreyt> because your version on the last sig will fail due to lack of backtracking

[00:18] <aufrank> yeah, that's right

[00:18] <putter> re arity, what about named greediness?  f g :a(1) :a(2)   g grabs none/both but no sharing?

[00:18] <aufrank> should we include that there's an implicit $self if there aren't any \: in the multi sig?

[00:19] <aufrank> or is that detected at the "production" level?

[00:19] <putter> ... so parser needs to consult param names as well as arity?

[00:21] <audreyt> putter: no, I think all named :a(1) are parsed into the "current" fun

[00:21] <audreyt> putter: and if it turns out there's no such named param, boom.

[00:22] <audreyt> aufrank: there is no implicit "self" if it's a multisub

[00:22] <putter> ... f g :a(1) :b :a(2)   where f has a+b and g only a?

[00:22] <audreyt> aufrank: it only goes there if it's a multimethod

[00:22] <aufrank> putter: is your question about f (g, :a(1), :a(2)) v f( g(:a(1), :a(2))) ?

[00:22] <audreyt> putter: in

[00:22] <audreyt>   f g :a(1) :b :a(2)

[00:22] <audreyt> I think it's always unambiguously

[00:22] *** mako132_ joined
[00:23] <audreyt>   f(  g(  a=>1, b=>Bool::True, a=>2 )  )

[00:23] <audreyt> and never any other interpretation

[00:23] <aufrank> I agree

[00:23] <putter> k

[00:23] <aufrank> if you want another parse, marke arguments to g explicitly with parens, right?

[00:23] <audreyt> yup.

[00:24] <audreyt> f (g) :a(1)

[00:24] <audreyt> f g() :a(1)

[00:24] <aufrank> right

[00:27] <putter> thanks for the clarifications

[00:28] <aufrank> audreyt: should the signature parser also parse the leading parts of the sub declaration?  my Int foo ( @bar ) { +@bar } # is Int parsed as part of the sig?

[00:28] <clkao> whoot

[00:28] <clkao> madness is happening

[00:28] <aufrank> hey clkao

[00:28] <clkao> unfortunately i need to go to bed

[00:28] <audreyt> clkao: I saw "svk ci --interactive"

[00:28] <clkao> audreyt: did you try it?

[00:29] <audreyt> nice job, but Iwonder if Term::ReadKey is more intuitive

[00:29] <audreyt> yeah

[00:29] <clkao> oh sure.

[00:29] <audreyt> aufrank: yes, Int is implicitly -->'ed

[00:29] <clkao> feel free to patch

[00:29] <clkao> i just wanted to get that into trunk given that's in reasonable state (editors splitted by norman)

[00:29] <clkao> otherwise it's going to fall behind again

[00:29] <clkao> i have another branch of massive cleanups

[00:29] <aufrank> audreyt: also multi|proto, and sub|method|submethod ?

[00:30] <aufrank> and my|our ?

[00:30] <audreyt> aufrank: the "my" part is not sig

[00:30] <audreyt> none of them is sig actually

[00:31] <audreyt> Int is

[00:31] <aufrank> but RETTYPE is

[00:31] <aufrank> ok, I can deal with that

[00:31] <audreyt> cool

[00:32] <aufrank> audreyt: do you have a suggestion about how to do defaults?  see line 80 of Signature.pg

[00:33] <aufrank> I guess that's a separate question from defaults.  So a) how to do aliasing?  and b) how to do defaults?

[00:34] <szbalint> audreyt: would you have a few minutes for a SoC related discussion?

[00:34] <audreyt> aufrank: I think you can safely put stuff in external/itnernal name for now

[00:35] <audreyt> instead of <name>[0]'ing it

[00:35] <audreyt> as for defaults, parse for an '=' followed by an <expression>

[00:35] <audreyt> and don't worry about how that's defined

[00:35] <audreyt> szbalint: sure

[00:35] <aufrank> so just have token external { <name> } , and use that in the parse?

[00:35] <szbalint> mind if I pm?

[00:36] <audreyt> that's fine

[00:36] <audreyt> aufrank: yup

[00:36] <audreyt> otoh, $<external> := <name>

[00:36] <audreyt> works too

[00:36] <audreyt> if you want explicit aliasing

[00:37] <aufrank> maybe the explicit parse is more maintainable

[00:38] <audreyt> yup

[00:39] <aufrank> audreyt: I actually had a different meaning of default in mind.  positional defaults to required, named defaults to optional.

[00:39] <putter> re defaults, need = <expr_above_comma> to avoid eating subsequent params

[00:40] <aufrank> because `$a, $b, $c` is a valid <expression>, but could also be the rest of the param list ?

[00:41] <putter> yes.  in ($a = 3, $b)  3,$b  is a valid expr

[00:41] <aufrank> got it

[00:41] *** nothingmuch joined
[00:41] <putter> err, $a = 3, $b = 4   and 3,$b=4

[00:42] <nothingmuch> win12

[00:42] <aufrank> win12 to you too!

[00:43] <nothingmuch> aufrank: =)

[00:46] <audreyt> putter: actually, I came up with a better way

[00:47] <putter> re arity, what about method calls?    f m o: 2 3    ": calls" greedy?

[00:47] <audreyt> <expression(terminates => ',')>

[00:47] <audreyt> putter: yes, a : makes things after it listop

[00:48] <putter> $a = (3,4)  ?

[00:49] <putter> post/circums extablish a new un-terminated <expr>?

[00:49] <audreyt> yup

[00:49] <audreyt> that also solves the

[00:49] <audreyt> if expr -> {}

[00:49] <audreyt> if expr {}

[00:49] <audreyt> problem

[00:50] <audreyt> by listing ->{} and {} as explicit terminators

[00:51] <aufrank> nice

[00:52] <putter> parsefail tokens :)

[00:53] <putter> btw, has there been any discussion of sequence-of-longest-possible-exprs comma-free lists?

[00:53] <putter> f 3 4 5

[00:54] <putter> all it takes is adding a "wedge" state to the opp

[00:54] <aufrank> is `sub foo (@a [$b, @c] = [3, [4, 5]]) { ... }` a valid sig?

[00:54] <audreyt> aufrank: I'd think so.

[00:54] <aufrank> or does it have to be (@a [$b = 3, @c = [4, 5]]) ?

[00:55] <aufrank> good, that's easier ;)

[00:55] <audreyt> :)

[00:55] <wolverian> heh, so we have x@(a:b) too? neat :)

[00:55] <audreyt> the two forms are subtly different :)

[00:55] <audreyt> wolverian: yup :)

[00:55] <aufrank> traits come after defaults?

[00:55] <aufrank> or before?  or either?

[00:56] <audreyt> unspecced

[00:56] <audreyt> before, if you ask me

[00:56] <aufrank> I like ($a = 3 is rw)

[00:57] <audreyt> but "3 is rw"

[00:57] <audreyt> may be calling infix:<is>

[00:57] <aufrank> oh, yuck

[00:57] <aufrank> ($a is rw = 3)

[00:57] <audreyt> i.e. the terminating list will grow

[00:57] <audreyt> yeah, I think I like that better

[00:57] <aufrank> fine by me

[00:57] <wolverian> audreyt, oh, do you know, can you use a stub declaration to declare the common signature of a set of subs (multis)? i.e. multi foo (Foo, Bar --> Baz) {...} multi foo ([], $bar) { ... } multi foo (@foo, $bar) { ... }

[00:58] <aufrank> but if you get a lot of traits, it could start being weird to have the "assignment" so far away from the variable

[00:58] <audreyt> wolverian: it's called "proto"

[00:58] <wolverian> oh.

[00:58] <audreyt> proto Baz foo (Foo, Bar)

[00:58] * wolverian hunts AES

[00:59] <audreyt> aufrank: just add a \n

[00:59] <wolverian> ah. there isn't an example in S06 so I kind of missed it. thanks, audrey!

[00:59] <audreyt> $a is rw is happy is nice is cheap is cheerful

[00:59] <audreyt>    = 4

[00:59] <wolverian> (oh, can I say [Foo] in a sig to mean List of Foo or so?)

[00:59] <audreyt> np :)

[00:59] <aufrank> man, I love $a!

[01:00] <audreyt> wolverian: current spec has it at

[01:00] <audreyt> Array[returns => Foo]

[01:00] <wolverian> I assume that would actually mean [Foo] # a list of one element, namely, the type Foo

[01:00] <audreyt> or, more succintly

[01:00] <audreyt> Array[Foo]

[01:00] <wolverian> that's fine. thanks.

[01:03] * xinming has to go...

[01:04] <xinming> bye all...

[01:04] <aufrank> bye!

[01:10] <wolverian> does this look sane? I'm experimenting. I'm uncertain about the flattening. it's a port from haskell. http://chronoa.dy.fi/~wolverian/code/poly.p6.html

[01:10] <audreyt> aufrank: you can do that in a production inside the rule

[01:10] <aufrank> ok, consider it punted-on :)

[01:11] <audreyt> subset Poly of Array[Term];

[01:11] <audreyt> is canonical

[01:11] <audreyt> you'll need *@poly in the unpack

[01:11] <wolverian> ah, that works. I said 'subset Poly of Array where Term;' in my head and immediately thought "ah, subset doesn't work here!"

[01:12] <wolverian> mm. true. thanks again

[01:12] <audreyt> otherwise looks kosher

[01:12] <aufrank> is there a way to use the :: synonym for subset in that?

[01:12] <wolverian> it's a bit simpler in haskell due to the differences in lists

[01:13] <wolverian> i.e. a : b instead of [a, *b]

[01:13] <audreyt> well, haskell is a lisp

[01:13] <wolverian> yeah.

[01:14] <audreyt> p6 is more sparse-arrayish

[01:14] <audreyt> in its []

[01:14] <audreyt> which turns out be more useful in practical extraction and reporting :)

[01:14] <wolverian> hm. would it work if I just returned (foo) instead of [foo]? then it wouldn't type as --> Poly though

[01:15] <wolverian> (s,would it work,could I remove the *s,)

[01:15] <wolverian> actually, I don't know what that would mean in type terms.

[01:16] <wolverian> i.e. sub { 1,2 } # what is the return type here?

[01:16] <audreyt> :(Int, Int)

[01:16] <wolverian> ah. a tuple. :)

[01:16] <audreyt> can be viewed as such :)

[01:17] <audreyt> sub { (1,2) }

[01:17] <audreyt> :(Seq[Int])

[01:17] <audreyt> note the parens

[01:17] <audreyt> but for most sigs

[01:17] <audreyt> those two are equivalent

[01:18] <wolverian> hmm. what's Seq?

[01:18] <audreyt> it's what was known as Tuple

[01:18] <audreyt> Seq is like HList I guess ;)

[01:18] <wolverian> ah. so it's not a supertype of Array?

[01:18] <audreyt> well, Seq is immutable

[01:18] <audreyt> and fully evaluated

[01:18] <wolverian> immutability is sort of assumed in this implementation ...

[01:18] <audreyt> i.e. has no Range parts

[01:19] <audreyt> nor iterator/generator parts

[01:19] <wolverian> right

[01:19] *** pdcawley_ joined
[01:19] <audreyt> in haskell it's a Data.Sequence

[01:19] <wolverian> maybe I should just leave off the type declarations and trust it's smart enough to infer what I mean. :)

[01:19] <audreyt> yup :)

[01:20] <wolverian> oh. is the return type inferred too?

[01:20] <wolverian> I assume it has to be.

[01:20] <audreyt> it has to be.

[01:20] <audreyt> or at least asserted.

[01:21] <wolverian> now we're back to the problem I have with haskell: I have to comment my code to make it obvious what each sub does.

[04:27] *** pdcawley_ joined
[04:28] <aufrank> I'll start another *.pg this week if you think there's another language element that's reasonably well-specced and self-contained

[04:30] <audreyt> Capture, for sure?

[04:30] <audreyt> having just parsed

[04:30] <audreyt> :(...)

[04:30] <audreyt> seems reasonable to parse

[04:30] <audreyt> \(...)

[04:31] <audreyt> "fixed" parts: invocant, positional, named

[04:31] <audreyt> "flattened" parts: *$foo

[04:31] <aufrank> captures can appear as arguments when a routine is called, but not as params when a routine is defined, correct?

[04:31] <audreyt> right.

[04:31] <audreyt> Capture is the dual of Signature

[04:32] * audreyt wonders how many hits does http://www.apple.com/macbook/ receive each day

[04:32] <aufrank> I hear Tuesday is the day for the macbook

[04:33] <audreyt> I further hear it's shipped from Asus's offices, which is like, not far from here :)

[04:33] * audreyt ponders a factory raid

[04:34] <aufrank> this is probably too broad a question, but what is the relation between Captures and Match objects?

[04:34] <aufrank> obviously a Capture could hold a Match object, that's not too interesting.  But are Match objects built out of Captures in any way, or can Captures be treated like Match objects?

[04:35] <aufrank> does a capturing match, <( foo )>, create a Capture?

[04:36] <aufrank> (I think that last one is what's got me thinking this way... the fact that we talk about capturing in matching and now we have things called Captures.  It makes me want them to be related)

[04:37] <audreyt> no

[04:37] <audreyt> the <( ... )> merely sets .end and .from

[04:38] <audreyt> Match isa Capture

[04:38] <audreyt> so all Matches are naturally subject to *()

[05:20] <gaal> and it has scans in one character too(!!)

[05:20] <wolverian> haven't used it myself, but I have seen people use it on perlmonks and elsewhere for real statistical stuff

[05:33] <spinclad> audreyt: yes, it's a straight walk of the tree of JudyL's (forward or backward).  i'll do the API spec first for comment and then the code will be simple (for C).  they will need to return buffer and length; i'm making sure there're no ownership issues on the buffers.

[05:34] <spinclad> i should have something in the new day; bedtime for me here tho

[10:11] * Aragone guesses "is there anyone here who speaks spanish who can help me"

[10:11] <Aragone> although that's based on my 15-year-old-Latin (and French) :(

[10:12] <azuroth> oh, that's n with a tilde-ish thing, not a question mark.

[12:28] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - you are incredible with doing that which you set out to do - except actually resting

[12:29] <audreyt> too true.

[12:29] <xinming> audreyt: hmm, there is a svk "bug" IMO. :-)

[12:29] <audreyt> #svk is the place for it :)

[12:29] <xinming> hmm, let me illustrate....

[12:29] <xinming> audreyt: Ok, #svk

[12:29] <audreyt> <- no longer an active svk committer

[12:30] <xinming> hmm, Ok, I'll ask clkao for that bug fix... :-)

[12:30] <audreyt> cool :)

[12:30] <audreyt> which means I actually get to rest, yay

[12:31] <xinming> audreyt: :-)

[12:35] <ludan> audreyt: do you live in the netherlands?

[12:41] <ludan> integral: where i can start to learn some haskell ? this is my first time with a functional language

[12:41] <ludan> s/some/a bit of/

[12:44] <audreyt> ludan: check out the pugs tree

[12:44] <audreyt> and read READTHEM

[12:44] <audreyt> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/READTHEM

[12:45] <integral> there's also stuff on haskell.org, but READTHEM is good.  Previous programming experience, and things like SICP help a lot :)

[12:45] <ludan> ok, many thans

[12:45] <ludan> *thanks

[12:47] <audreyt> also there is my haskell talk

[12:47] <audreyt> http://yapc.g.hatena.ne.jp/jkondo/20060330/1143700046

[12:48] <audreyt> I wonder if it belongs to READTHEM. hmm.

[13:04] <gaal> ludan: don't be discouraged if one tutorial doesn't work for you right away. I'd start with audreyt's slides (is there a version of that with audio already?) and "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial"

[13:04] <ludan> gaal: ok, thanks :)

[13:05] <gaal> The "Gentle Introduction" is a little terse, but its treatment of everything except monads is pretty good too

[13:06] <gaal> find one you like the style of, and if there's a topic you don't understand, look in another text, or ask here or in #haskell

[13:06] *** macroron joined

[17:08] <pmurias> where does Pugs::Compiler::Emit::Parsec live or is it still in planning stage?

[17:12] *** bpederse joined
[17:20] <pmurias> gaal: i read the article you posted before and reread it now, but the lack of an open source implementation, is a big obstacle for me in learing/using a language

[17:21] *** drbean_ joined
[17:21] <FurnaceBoy> is that K ?

[17:21] <pmurias> yes

[17:21] <FurnaceBoy> heh

[17:22] <FurnaceBoy> yeah it looks great, but it's a dealbreaker in anyone's language :-)

[17:22] * FurnaceBoy felt the same way

[17:22] <gaal> It doesn't have to be an obstacle for stealing ideas though :-)

[17:22] <FurnaceBoy> :)

[17:25] <pmurias> the latest version of the language is named Q by the way

[17:26] <gaal> was the previous one named C?

[17:26] <gaal> oh no wait, that's taken :)

[17:27] * pmurias has to learn C and STL, and dosn't like them one bit

[17:29] <FurnaceBoy> "has to" ?

[17:29] <FurnaceBoy> you've come to the right place

[17:29] <FurnaceBoy> for relief

[17:30] <gaal> C isn't that bad. C++ just pisses me off all the time

[17:30] <gaal> well ok C is bad :)

[17:30] <gaal> but it's not bad for what it does well.

[17:31] <FurnaceBoy> quite.

[17:31] <FurnaceBoy> I suppose pmurias meant C++ since he mentioned STL.

[17:33] <pmurias> well i prepare for an algorithmic competition, and the only library you are allowed to use is the STL

[17:34] <pmurias> i want to use only as much C++ as nessesary to use STL

[17:35] <pmurias> so i don't have to write hashes and linked list myself

[17:35] *** bernhard joined

[17:53] <pmurias> Introduction to Algorithms, will arive tommorow and i have the Art of Computer Programming, does anyone know other good algorithmic books?

[17:55] <PerlJam> I wonder if it might make a good publicity stunt to have a parrot/perl6 programming contest.

[17:57] <PerlJam> Or even just get SPOJ to accept parrot + pugs solutions

[17:57] <integral> At a conference?    Or a ICFP type contest?

[17:58] <Arathorn> pmurias: there's a big white tome with red leafs on the front which is very good

[17:58] * Arathorn looks for it quickly

[17:58] <FurnaceBoy> obfuscated Parrot?

[17:58] <Arathorn> ah, that is Introduction to Algorithms

[17:58] <PerlJam> integral: both

[17:58] *** DaGo joined
[17:58] <Arathorn> well, TAoC and Introduction to Algorithms is all I have...

[17:59] <PerlJam> integral: presumably the contest would be run at OScon or something rather than just the usual perl conferences.

[17:59] <PerlJam> I can't guage the bang/buck ratio on this idea though.

[17:59] <PerlJam> s/guage/gauge/

[18:02] <pmurias> PerJam: what is SPOJ?

[18:03] <PerlJam> http://www.spoj.pl/

[18:07] <pmurias> it was the first link i got on google, but couldn't belive it's something polish

[18:18] <pmurias> although there's very heavy emphasis on algorithms in Poland

[21:24] <PerlJam> (I don't have any answers, but I didn't think pugs even did STM properly)

[21:25] <cmarcelo> sorry, I just mention "atomic { }" because I saw one idea about this once... I was meant to ask if it supports STM =)
