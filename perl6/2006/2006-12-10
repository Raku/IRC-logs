[14:37] <Dr_Pi> I appear to have forgotten my password to http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/. How can I recover it?

[14:37] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 14879: /

[14:39] <gaal> Dr_Pi: http://commitbit.pugscode.org/ when it gets the password reminder feature :)

[14:39] <gaal> what's your userid so i can reset it for you?

[14:39] <Dr_Pi> Ivan_A_Frey

[14:39] <gaal> one minute please...

[14:40] <gaal> it's being slow :(

[14:42] <Dr_Pi> gaal: I'm doing this crazy thing and trying to checkout pugs using Eclipse, Subclipse, and EclipseFP.

[14:43] <Dr_Pi> gaal: but there's no rush.

[14:43] <Limbic_Region> s/Pi/Evil/

[14:44] <Dr_Pi> Limbic_Region: :-)

[14:48] <gaal> hey, cool. i tried eclipse fp about 1.5yr ago with pugs

[14:48] <gaal> never did work though

[14:51] <gaal> Dr_Pi: see /msg

[14:53] <gaal> Dr_Pi: if you're replying i'm not seeing you... are you registered on freenode?

[14:54] <Limbic_Region> gaal - [09:55] -NickServ-          Registered: 20 weeks 3 days (2h 17m 11s) ago

[14:54] <Limbic_Region> so yes

[14:56] <gaal> Limbic_Region: thanks.

[14:56] <gaal> Dr_Pi: see email.

[15:15] <Dr_Pi> gaal: I finally got hello world to work, so I figure it's but a small step to pugs, ;-)

[15:18] <gaal> Dr_Pi: yay :)

[15:18] <gaal> bbiab :)

[15:40] <Dr_Pi> gaal: I gotta go too. I'm checking out pugs, now. And will update you on my progress.

[15:43] *** kanru joined
[15:44] <Dr_Pi> Wow, I've just checked out pugs and eclipse is already building it.

[17:34] <dweebgrrl> can we ask questions here?

[17:34] <gaal> certainly.

[17:35] <dweebgrrl> i'm taking a perl class ... i need a perl environment.. are there any free perl environments

[17:36] <dweebgrrl> i am using win xp at home

[17:36] <gaal> ah, this kind of question is better asked on #perl, not #perl6 :-)

[17:36] <gaal> but:

[17:36] <dweebgrrl> at work we will be using freebsd

[17:36] <dweebgrrl> ok

[17:36] <gaal> yes, there is. if you want an IDE that work on both, try Eclipse

[17:36] <gaal> it has a Perl plugin

[17:36] <dweebgrrl> ok thanks

[17:37] <gaal> and is a great IDE for Java, and a fair one for C/C++

[17:37] <gaal> also consider vim / emacs

[17:37] <gaal> (both run on the platforms you mentioned)

[17:37] <dweebgrrl> ok and eclipse is free download too right

[17:37] <gaal> also also, welcome to perl and be sure to check out http://perlmonks.org/ :-)

[17:37] <lambdabot> Title: PerlMonks - The Monastery Gates

[17:38] <gaal> Yes, Eclipse is free.

[17:38] <dweebgrrl> ok

[17:38] <gaal> enter "ide" in search on that site and you'll find loads of info

[17:38] <dweebgrrl> thanks

[17:38] <gaal> sure

[18:05] <gaal> Dr_Pi: I was curious and tried eclipsefp myself now too :) with default settings it seems to just build Setup. have you any experience with moosing cabalized moose?

[18:05] <gaal> (Created an executable in Pugs/theResult, hehe.)

[18:06] <gaal> FWIW: our build system does a lot of stuff on its own, so I'm not expecting this to Just Work at all

[18:07] <gaal> but if you want to hack on it to get at least parts working -- e.g., require the user to run perl Makefile.PL ; make ; ... ^C and refresh from Eclipse...

[18:07] <gaal> ... that'd be great :)
