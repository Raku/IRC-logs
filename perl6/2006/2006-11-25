[09:47] <Tene> got a bugfix for Net::IRC

[09:48] <Tene> Net/IRC.pm:180

[09:48] <Tene> $event<from_nick> needs to be normalized

[09:49] <audreyt> A commit bit is on its way to you :)

[09:49] <audreyt> good thing I asked :)

[09:49] <audreyt> please add yourself to AUTHORS along with the commit

[09:49] <audreyt> welcome aboard!

[09:50] <Tene> Thanks.

[09:53] <audreyt> that doesn't seem to be right

[09:53] <audreyt> please replace it with commitbit.pugscode.org

[09:53] <audreyt> I'll investigate

[09:55] <audreyt> should be fine now

[09:55] <audreyt> have you registered yet?

[09:57] <Tene> just now.

[10:01] <audreyt> tested, it's fixed now. thanks!

[10:04] <svnbot6> r14844 | tene++ | Broke with nicks containing capital letters.

[10:04] <audreyt> should I restart the two bots, then?

[10:04] <Tene> only if you're giving them nicks with capital letters.

[10:04] <audreyt> ah. I see

[10:04] <audreyt> k, no need to restart then. much thanks :)

[10:10] <Tene> ... wow, mischan

[10:10] <audreyt> np :)

[10:10] <audreyt> are you deploying svnbot or evalbot somewhere? :)

[10:11] <Tene> played around with evalbot a few days ago.  Just playing with Net::IRC right now.

[10:12] <audreyt> cool. if you have some cycles, maybe revive Net::IRC::OO :) as our OO is now definitely good enoough for it and N::I's old functional-OO style is no longer needed

[10:12] <audreyt> making Net::IRC OO and porting svnbot/evalbot to it would be nice

[10:15] *** elmex joined

[13:02] <agentzh> audreyt: the only remaining issue is the warning 'Name "YAML::Syck::ImplicitUnicode" used only once: possible typo'

[13:03] <agentzh> audreyt: i think YAML/Syck.pm should at least mention $ImplicitUnicode in it. :)

[14:33] <Malekar> hey everyone :) can someone recommend a book for programming perl scripts which involve cisco routers and switches? i'm interested in pinging using snmp from a certain router interface to a second router's interface and storing the results locally

[14:34] <Limbic_Region> Malekar - this is #perl6 to discuss the development of the Perl 6 programming language

[14:34] <Limbic_Region> Malekar - unless you want Perl 6 (which isn't finished yet)

[14:34] <Limbic_Region> Malekar - try #perl

[14:34] <rindolf> Malekar: /jion #perl

[14:34] <Malekar> thanks

[22:59] <Limbic_Region> look for "Is there a release date set for perl 6.0 ?"
