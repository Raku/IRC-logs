[12:47] <tomyan> audrey|ingy: trying to grok how Module::Compile works...

[12:47] <tomyan> came accross what I thought was a bug with the contents of HEREDOCS being replaced with a digest, but from the tests this looks like expected behaviour

[12:48] <tomyan> ping audre

[13:01] <Limbic_Region> http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/29666 # Complaint from Ovid that running make test takes 4 1/2 hours

[13:09] <cognominal> I thought that audreyt has fixed that recently?

[13:10] <Limbic_Region> well, it certainly is way faster

[13:10] <Limbic_Region> but I haven't ran nmake test in months

[13:11] <Limbic_Region> but I am just the messenger - Ovid apparently did this very recently and is still seeing a 4 1/2 hour time to complete

[13:34] <ingy> hi tomyan

[13:34] <tomyan> hi

[13:34] <ingy> what's up?

[13:34] <tomyan> think it was cos there was an error compiling so it didn't finish

[13:35] <ingy> so is there a bug?

[13:35] <tomyan> i see now that it translates the digest back to the contents of the heredoc

[13:35] <tomyan> was having trouble seeing what the error was

[13:35] <tomyan> made it go away by moving the use MyFilter; ... no MyFilter; earlier in the file

[13:36] <ingy> ok

[13:37] <ingy> please report any bugs to rt.cpan.org

[13:37] <tomyan> yeah, will have a poke at it later and see if i can make a failing test case

[13:37] <tomyan> v cool mod btw

[13:39] <ingy> yeah!

[13:39] <ingy> it needs a rewrite or two, but yeah

[13:39] <ingy> actually it just needs to be finished

[15:21] <^Nikos> perl 6 is out?

[15:21] <PerlJam> ^Nikos: a prototype called "pugs" is out.

[15:22] <PerlJam> The official perl6 compiler isn't done yet.

[15:22] <^Nikos> i see

[15:22] <^Nikos> when will it be ready?

[15:22] <PerlJam> when it's ready

[15:22] <^Nikos> umm 2-3 month from now?

[15:23] <PerlJam> ^Nikos: I believe there will be an alpha compiler release this year and a production release late next year or maybe the following year

[15:24] <^Nikos> i see

[15:24] <^Nikos> will there perl ahs major changes?

[15:25] <PerlJam> ^Nikos: um ... yes?

[15:25] *** ^Nikos left
[15:25] <ingy> ahs?

[15:25] <particle_> has

[15:25] <ingy> aft hand side

[15:25] <ingy> audrey hand side

[15:26] <particle_> ^Nikos: see http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ for perl6 info

[15:27] <particle_> read the Synopses if you're interested in the differences/new features

[15:28] <cognominal> ^Nikos, this will not be a mere major release

[15:29] <particle_> cog: sure, it's really 6.0.0.0.0 (community, major, minor, patch, bug/fix)

[15:30] <cognominal> as a revolution, it will be way more than perl5 without the epicycles

[15:30] <ayrnieu> hah!  It can't possibly work without epicycles.

[15:31] <PerlJam> All I know is that we need to release perl6 before TimToady gets too insane.  ;-)

[15:32] <cognominal> arynieu: I would like to avoid retrograd movement like version strings :)

[15:32] <particle_> perhaps grandfatherhood will slow the pace of his insanity...

[15:32] <PerlJam> or speed it up

[15:33] <cognominal> Timtoady is already insane, I fear the day he will become sane

[15:33] <particle_> pj: i guess you're the "brain half empty" type

[15:33] <PerlJam> actually, I really only care that perl6 is released before *I* go too insane

[15:33] <ayrnieu> insanity is just acceleration.

[15:33] <Limbic_Region> particle_ - the law of conservation requires the degree to which TimToady's insanity is decreased by the arrival of the grandchild, the insanity shift in his child (grandchild's parent) will increase to the same degree

[15:33] <PerlJam> particle_: my brain is always empty.  I'm constantly looking for things to fill it with.

[15:34] <cognominal> superior order appears like entropy or insanity to the illiterate

[15:34] <Limbic_Region> in fact, you can't even break even - the insanity of the child will increase more than that by which TimToady's decreased

[15:34] <particle_> "a brain is a hole in your head into which you pour money."

[15:34] <ayrnieu> or time, which is also money.

[15:35] <particle_> to paraphrase the old quote about boats, planes, cars.

[20:01] <pasteling> "masak" at 130.238.83.176 pasted "Is the fifth test in t/builtins/lists/reverse.t correct? I don't see any stringification." (8 lines, 272B) at http://sial.org/pbot/17297

[20:02] *** bjoern_h joined
[20:20] <PerlJam> masak: is() imposes a string context on its first two arguments.  Perhaps that's leaking somewhere.

[20:21] <masak> PerlJam: the way I understand it, that would be too late for "foo" to become "oof"

[20:24] *** avar joined
[20:24] <masak> now, had the test said reverse(~("foo", "bar")), that would be another thing

[20:25] <masak> as it stands right now, I don't get it

[20:28] * particle_ suggests using svn blame to track down how that test got there

[20:29] <PerlJam> What does item() do exactly?

[20:30] <particle_> the doc (S29) isn't too clear: "Forces generic Item context on its argument, and returns it."

[20:31] <PerlJam> right.  I don't know what that means.

[20:31] <particle_> hrmm, i suppose that stringifies it

[20:31] <particle_> as opposed to list context

[20:31] *** DaGo joined
[20:36] <masak> particle_: in any case, stringification after reversing the list will not produce "oof" from "foo"

[20:36] <particle_> nope, but reverse(item(... should do it

[20:36] <masak> hmm

[20:37] <masak> ?eval reverse(item("foo", "bar"))

[20:37] <evalbot_10383> ("bar", "foo")

[20:37] <masak> not currently, no

[20:37] <particle_> hrmm

[20:37] <masak> OTOH, I don't know either what item does

[20:38] <masak> question is: can we, with our limited knowledge, conclude that the test is wrong?

[20:38] <masak> in that case, I can patch it

[20:38] <masak> otherwise we'll have to wait for someone to come along who knows more

[20:39] <particle_> i believe, given it's definition in S29, item should take some number of args, and return them in item (iirc, scalar) context

[20:39] <particle_> seems the test is wrong

[20:39] <masak> i'm tempted to write stringification like this: reverse(~("foo", "bar")

[20:40] <masak> because i don't know much about item()

[20:40] <particle_> that seems like it'll work, and avoid a poorly documented op

[20:40] <masak> yes

[20:40] <masak> i suspect the test is faulty from copy/paste
