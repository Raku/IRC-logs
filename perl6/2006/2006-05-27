[01:51] <audreyt> Sage is going to arrive here in a day or two, I think...

[01:51] <audreyt> (working on Perl5->MAD->Perl6)

[01:51] <clkao> is it nearly christmas yet?

[01:52] <audreyt> 7 months to go

[01:53] <clkao> can we make it faster?

[01:53] <cmarcelo> audreyt: thanks. if I have (lot of) trouble to finish this week "milestone" i'll warn you, ok? (remember my newbie condition hehe =P)

[01:55] <audreyt> (the milestone involves filling in low-level FFI bindings to spinclad's patched Judy tree)

[01:55] <audreyt> sure, just ping me here and/or seek help on #haskell :)

[03:30] <wolverian> audreyt, welcome back! I missed you :)

[03:32] <audreyt> thanks :) however I'm not, like, completely back yet

[03:32] <audreyt> still another day or two to go

[03:32] <audreyt> I've been breathing and eating and dreaming in Jifty ;)

[03:32] <wolverian> don't hurry :)

[03:32] <wolverian> I've been diving into Plagger, it's fun too.

[03:32] <audreyt> plagger is nice

[03:32] <audreyt> miyagawa is clearly onto something

[03:33] <audreyt> and/or on something

[03:33] <wolverian> perhaps

[03:33] <wolverian> I'll commit/send a simple FOAF plugin when miyagawa wakes up :)

[03:34] <audreyt> :D

[03:43] <obra> hi audreyt

[03:44] <obra> What's new in your jiftyverse?

[03:47] <audreyt> trying to go back to action declarators

[03:47] <audreyt> win32 packaging improvements

[03:47] <audreyt> (since it proved to be a popular demo device)

[03:48] <audreyt> get the testing DSL working with generic apps, not just mine

[03:48] <audreyt> thinking about a better dispatch logic than the current Dispatcher->masonview->fragment->rico

[03:48] <audreyt> possibly ::TT2

[03:49] <audreyt> reading up on nothingmuch's Monju

[03:49] <obra> All very interesting.

[03:49] <audreyt> thinking about Moose patterns and Jifty patterns

[03:49] <audreyt> etc etc.

[03:49] <obra> oh. jifty's tests run fast on the macbook ;)

[03:50] <audreyt> I'm off to pickup my freshly arrived macbook

[03:50] <audreyt> in 1hr

[03:50] <obra> Nice. .tw model or .us model?

[03:50] <audreyt> from .hk; they don't sell themn in .tw

[03:50] <audreyt> have to wait for 2months+

[03:50] <obra> Darwinports is treating me very well.

[03:50] <audreyt> so $boss picked it up from .hk

[03:50] <obra> I'm actually going to keep OSX on it.

[03:50] <obra> nice

[03:50] <audreyt> cool. thinking about a OSX/Ubuntu dual boot

[03:50] <obra> Darwinports has a native svk

[03:50] <audreyt> I want to playwith debian :)

[03:51] <obra> might want to consider osx + parallels

[03:51] <obra> no bootloader issues. should still be very fast

[03:51] <audreyt> black macbook is out of stock entire .hk

[03:51] <obra> tanks to intel virtualization

[03:51] <obra> The black..did not impress me.

[03:51] <audreyt> so got one white 2.0ghc

[03:51] <audreyt> s/ghc/ghz/

[03:51] <obra> it's weird and matte.

[03:51] <audreyt> yeah, so had others reported

[03:51] <obra> I ended up with the white. Eventially, I'll rpeeplace the disk. which is now a supported operation

[03:52] <audreyt> cool

[03:52] <audreyt> I think the stock 80gb is sufficient

[03:52] <audreyt> ram maxed out to 2g

[03:52] <obra> oh. this was a custom built machine?

[03:52] <obra> The stock 2ghz white has 60

[03:52] <audreyt> nod, but they can replace stuff onthefly

[03:52] <audreyt> so they did

[03:52] <obra> Ah. better than in .us.

[03:53] <audreyt> so... very much looking forward to hack stuff without being cpu-bound on compilation

[03:53] <obra> Who should I bribe to get your jifty innovations into the repo?

[03:53] <obra> Yeah. I know that feeling

[03:53] <obra> hiveminder tests went from 20 minutes to 3

[03:53] <audreyt> they'll trickle into the repo naturally

[03:53] <audreyt> (!)

[03:54] <obra> It was CPU _and_ disk bound.

[03:54] <audreyt> at latest, we'll do that en masse in Boston

[03:54] <obra> oh. I should try building pugs.

[03:54] <audreyt> yeah.

[03:54] <obra> To install gd, darwinports needed to build xfree

[03:55] <obra> It took 25 minutes

[03:55] <audreyt> http://www.uni-graz.at/imawww/haskell/ghc-6.5.20060409-i386-apple-darwin.tar.bz2

[03:56] <audreyt> newer builds may be available somewhere

[03:56] <obra> oh good: sh-2.05b# port install ghc

[03:56] <obra> GHC is not supported on OS X i386 yet

[03:56] <audreyt> but xerox built pugs with it

[03:56] <audreyt> on x86mac; and as such should work on your setting

[03:56] <obra> yeah. the problem is only darwinports

[03:57] <audreyt> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC_on_Intel_Macs

[03:57] <obra> Great. Man. this hotel net is slow

[03:59] <obra> (Redirects to http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/X86OSXGhc)

[03:59] <obra> That's enough caveats that it's not a tonight project

[03:59] <obra> but cool

[04:01] <audreyt> I'll get it working today :)

[04:08] *** justatheory joined

[05:04] <spinclad> audreyt: welcome back!

[05:04] <spinclad> cmarcelo: welcome!

[05:04] <spinclad> audreyt, cmarcelo:  re JudyHS: the insides are not done but the interface is ready i believe.

[05:04] <spinclad> (and finally)

[05:04] <spinclad> TimToady: julian++!  this recent day, 2006-05-25, is hereby declared a julian day in his honour!  and docs r9310 a julian revision!

[05:05] <spinclad> (see what happens when i look away for a moment)

[05:08] <cmarcelo> spinclad: thanks! =) tomorrow i'll start playing with the code.. you're doing iteration primitives for the Judy types, right?

[05:09] <spinclad> for JudyHS, yes, the others (Judy1, L, SL) had iter entries already though not with helper iterator objects

[05:10] <cmarcelo> helper iterator objects?

[05:11] <spinclad> if you look at the JudyHS.3 man page you can see my spec

[05:12] <cmarcelo> ok

[05:12] <spinclad> third-party/judy/Judy-1.0.3/doc/ext/JudyHS_3.htm

[05:14] <spinclad> i invented a JudyHSIter type to have a place to update the string and length as oen iterates

[05:14] <spinclad> s/oen/one/

[05:15] *** rawr joined
[05:16] <spinclad> so there are five new calls added to the JudyHS interface.

[05:17] <spinclad> JudyHSIter{First,Next,Last,Prev} and JudyHSFreeIter

[05:17] <cmarcelo> i see..

[05:18] <spinclad> i think it makes sense, waffled on it for a few days trying to think it through, this is what settled out of the muck.

[05:18] <spinclad> (comments welcome)

[05:19] <spinclad> will you be modifying HsJudy?

[05:21] <spinclad> (anything that's unclear when you read that manpage, please shout)

[05:22] <cmarcelo> yep. it's my job to get it working with a haskell-friendly API...

[05:22] <spinclad> excellent

[13:43] <scw> Limbic_Region: so should I svn switch to this url?

[13:43] <Limbic_Region> which is referenced on Pugs homepage ;-)

[13:43] <Limbic_Region> dunno - don't know svn/svk well enough to know how to say to do this temporarily

[13:43] <Limbic_Region> since svn.openfoundry.org is the master

[13:44] <scw> I'll try switch first, if it doesn't work I'll checkout another copy

[13:44] <scw> Thanks

[13:45] <scw> no, couldn't switch :(  create the patch then

[16:11] <audreyt> a complete from-checkout pugs "make" took... less than 8 minutes on this macbook.

[16:11] <audreyt> I wonder how long "make smoke" will take

[16:12] <Limbic_Region> Ovid was b1tching about the make test time the other day

[16:12] <Limbic_Region> I linked to his journal entry about it

[16:12] <Limbic_Region> but I think you were already incommunicado

[16:13] <Limbic_Region> this was even after the considerable speedups

[16:14] <audreyt> yeah. judyhs is likely to help some more on make test time

[16:14] <audreyt> and faster strings

[16:14] <Limbic_Region> http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/29666

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> complaining that it takes 4 1/2 hours

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> and a reply to that indicated 5 1/2

[16:15] <audreyt> that's a lot

[16:15] <audreyt> it takes 50min on my old laptop

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> right - that's what I thought

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> so I pasted it here

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> I also pasted a few Pugs posts at the Monastery hoping someone would pick them up and run with them too

[16:16] <Limbic_Region> not sure what if anything happened

[16:16] <audreyt> nod

[16:16] <integral> hmm, my pugs didn't seem to be getting a precomp prelude when I last built; should it have been?

[16:16] <audreyt> integral: look under under blib6/lib/Prelude*?

[16:16] <audreyt> and rm it if needed

[16:16] <integral> ah

[16:16] <audreyt> rm blib6/lib/*.yml

[16:16] <audreyt> and then 'make'

[16:17] <integral> you switched to .yml.gz?

[16:17] <audreyt> no, gaal broke compat on .yml format

[16:17] <audreyt> to introduce version field

[16:17] <audreyt> so it won't break again

[16:17] <audreyt> ironically

[16:17] <integral> lovely :)

[16:19] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - is $work project all but over or is weekend hacking just a temporary state?

[16:20] * Limbic_Region is very excited about the prospect of being able to work on Pugs/Parrot again at work (when family obligations at home aren't a factor)

[16:21] <audreyt> er, I'm supposed to finish up $work this weekend
