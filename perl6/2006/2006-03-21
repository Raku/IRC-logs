[00:21] <wolverian> Juerd, hey, nice colours on juerd.nl :)

[00:22] <Juerd> wolverian: It's random, so cache them while you can ;)

[00:23] <wolverian> yeah, I noticed :)

[00:25] <Juerd> It's some perl module that generates them. Most of the time, it's nice.

[00:25] <Juerd> I haven't figured out how to calculate which one of <white black> will contrast most, though.

[00:25] <jisom> convert to grayscale, measure the difference, if not enough, recalculate?

[00:26] <Juerd> jisom: I don't know how to convert to grayscale properly.

[00:26] <Juerd> The mean of R, G and B, certainly isn't useful.

[00:27] <jisom> I know swing has one in it's source....but it might be sufficient to try

[00:27] <wolverian> Juerd, hold a sec, I'll get you the coefficients

[00:32] <FurnaceBoy> Juerd, you can also add 0x80,0x80,0x80 to get a highly contrasting colour.

[00:32] <FurnaceBoy> add and modulo

[00:33] <TimToady> won't that turn gray into gray?

[00:33] <FurnaceBoy> no, it would turn 0x80,0x80,0x80 into white :-)

[00:33] <FurnaceBoy> sorry, into black

[00:33] <TimToady> ah, gotcha.

[00:34] <FurnaceBoy> but 0x7f,0x7f,0x7f into white

[00:34] * particle_ sees a red door

[00:34] <FurnaceBoy> it's sorta handy for overlaying stuff.

[00:34] <TimToady> don't eat the red door.

[00:34] <FurnaceBoy> where you have a continuously changing background like an image

[00:34] <FurnaceBoy> so cannot pick a single colour to contrast

[00:35] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: No, adding 0x80 xx 3 doesn't help on bright colours...

[00:35] <TimToady> Seems like xor with 0x80,0x80,0x80 does the same thing...

[00:35] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: Oh, modulo.. Hmmm...

[00:35] <FurnaceBoy> TimToady, no

[00:35] <FurnaceBoy> hmm

[00:35] <FurnaceBoy> yes

[00:35] <FurnaceBoy> :-)

[00:36] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: I guess it would create something contrasting, but I'd like to stick to black and white.

[00:36] <FurnaceBoy> yes

[00:36] <FurnaceBoy> it's really only useful for image-like backgrounds

[00:36] <jisom> a % 0x80 => a & 0x7f

[00:36] <wolverian> Juerd, Color::Scheme has a convenient looking ->distance() method, btw. anyway, here are the coefficients for the channels if you want to calculate the contrast for a human eye: 0.30 0.59 0.11 (RGB). then calculate the distance as if the channels were dimensions, normalising if you want.

[00:37] <FurnaceBoy> that's not actually based on the eye; those are the traditional NTSC coefficients

[00:37] <wolverian> oh, sorry.

[00:37] <FurnaceBoy> well, they're based on the eye to the extent the 195x NTSC coeffs are :-)

[00:37] <FurnaceBoy> mostly still used

[00:37] <wolverian> do you have better ones?

[00:37] <FurnaceBoy> no, was just nitpicking. ;_)

[00:37] <wolverian> ok :)

[00:37] <Juerd> wolverian: I lack math skills to understand that, though. What's a coefficient, and everything from "calculate the distance" I understand in English, yet I don't know what it actually means :)

[00:37] <FurnaceBoy> the NTSC are still commonly used

[00:38] <FurnaceBoy> Istr a paper on perceptual neutral density ... hmm.

[00:38] <wolverian> Juerd, each value there is multiplied against the two colours' difference for that channel. i.e. 0.3 * (col1.r - col2.r) etc.

[00:38] <Juerd> wolverian: But I only have one colour, the background colour.

[00:39] <wolverian> oh, then I misunderstood what you wanted. :)

[00:39] <FurnaceBoy> well,

[00:39] <FurnaceBoy> those coeffs still give you a useful grey conversion

[00:39] <FurnaceBoy> g = .30r + .59g + .11b

[00:39] <Juerd> Given a certain background colour, I want to know if white or black is the better foreground colour.

[00:39] <FurnaceBoy> note (.30+.59+.11) = 1.0

[00:40] <wolverian> Juerd, then you _do_ have two colours, or three, to be exact.

[00:40] <FurnaceBoy> yes, you can grey-ise as above

[00:40] <FurnaceBoy> then check whether it's >.5 or <.5

[00:40] <Juerd> wolverian: Really?

[00:40] <wolverian> Juerd, white, black, and your bg colour.

[00:40] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: Ahh. I'll try that.

[00:40] <Juerd> wolverian: Hmm.

[00:40] <wolverian> FurnaceBoy's method should work fine here.

[00:41] <FurnaceBoy> fwiw, I believe Photoshop's RGB->Grey Scale conversion still uses those exact coefficients.

[00:41] <FurnaceBoy> absent colour management settings.

[00:41] <wolverian> you don't need to calculate the real distance, only compare distances, and that works fine with manhattan distance

[00:41] <wolverian> (too many 'distance's there..)

[00:42] <wolverian> FurnaceBoy, er, isn't NTSC YUV?

[00:42] <wolverian> FurnaceBoy, or do you mean those coefficients are what it comes to after translating to RGB? sorry, slow tonight..

[00:43] <Arathorn> NTSC's only YUV if you happen to digitize it into chrominance & luminance

[00:43] * Arathorn promptly stops talking, given he can't remember how the colourburst is encoded in PAL, let alone Never The Same Color twice

[00:44] <FurnaceBoy> "The coefficients 0.299, 0.587 and 0.114 properly computed luminance for monitors having phosphors that were contemporary at the introduction of NTSC television in 1953, however, these coefficients do not accurately compute luminance for contemporary monitors."

[00:44] <wolverian> FurnaceBoy, thanks.

[00:44] <FurnaceBoy> I would concur with that last remark, those coeffs aren't quite right for usual screens

[00:44] <wolverian> well, screens differ hugely in colour reproduction anyway

[00:44] <FurnaceBoy> yep.

[00:44] <FurnaceBoy> and Juerd only needs a "close enough for govt work" answer :-)

[00:44] <wolverian> LCDs have really bad curves

[00:45] * wolverian hates his laptop's "black", which is more like gray

[00:45] <FurnaceBoy> this guy is a colour theory master http://www.poynton.com/

[00:45] <wolverian> FurnaceBoy++

[00:45] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: This works quite well. I used a threshold of 0x90 instead of 0x80, though.

[00:46] <FurnaceBoy> yeah, that's probably exactly the result of the gamma shift since 1953 :-)

[00:46] <Juerd> wolverian: Almost all TFT black is gray, because TFT's natural colour is white.

[00:46] <wolverian> yeah. OLED please. :)

[00:46] <FurnaceBoy> yeah. subtractive

[00:46] <Juerd> wolverian: The pixels don't manage to fully block that.

[00:46] <FurnaceBoy> but this Samsung is mightly black...

[00:46] <Juerd> FurnaceBoy: And probably glossy too, then.

[00:46] <FurnaceBoy> except it still suffers a lot at the dark end of the range

[00:46] <FurnaceBoy> playing MPEG for instance

[00:47] <wolverian> Juerd, hm, is juerd.nl using the new code now? I'm getting somewhat non-contrasty results for the date title on the frontpage

[00:47] <Juerd> I hate glossy screens.

[00:47] <FurnaceBoy> no, it's fairly matte

[00:47] <FurnaceBoy> just a good 1:700 or more

[00:47] <Juerd> wolverian: Yes, it is.

[00:47] <ayrnieu> black looks quite good on this Apple Cinema 20" -- but yes, glossy.

[00:47] <Juerd> wolverian: Did you get white?

[00:47] <wolverian> I got white text on a very light blue

[00:47] <wolverian> let me check the colours

[00:47] <Juerd> I'll get it back to 0x80 then

[00:48] <Juerd> See /css.plp, the comments at the top

[00:48] <Juerd> I need to base things differently for the code blocks

[00:48] *** Arathorn is now known as Aragone

[00:49] <wolverian> I got (128, 255, 247) for the bg of the <h2> and white as the text colour

[00:49] <wolverian> (that's 80fff7)

[00:51] <Juerd> I was using the wrong colours for the background :)

[00:51] <Juerd> The calculation was based on the pure colour, not the lighter tint

[00:51] <wolverian> ah. :)

[00:52] <wolverian> ow, got a bad one again

[00:53] <Juerd> Yea, I'm lost in my single letter variables, and meaningless array indices.

[00:53] <wolverian> Color::Scheme looks really nice. I'll try this on my css files.. :)

[00:54] <Juerd> It should be okay now

[00:54] <Juerd> wolverian: Beware... you'll like it, your visitors will like it, and it will cost you more time than you now think it does.

[00:54] <wolverian> seems to be

[00:54] <wolverian> Juerd, oh, I don't have any visitors.

[00:55] <Juerd> http://tnx.nl/4603WGFV  # horrible code

[00:55] <wolverian> eww :)

[00:56] <Juerd> Worse is that it leads to things like

[00:56] <Juerd>     background: <:= $c[2][0] :>;

[00:56] <Juerd>     color: <:= $c[2][4] :>;

[00:56] <wolverian> egh, my $b = ...$b[0]...$b[1]...; # wow that is confusing :)

[00:57] <Juerd> Yea.

[00:57] <Juerd> And don't make the mistake of thinking 'c' stands for colour. That's purely coincidental.

[00:59] <Juerd> I've written more than enough crappy code in my life to know what is and what is not maintainable. Still, for private site things, I *like* messing around with crappy code.

[00:59] <wolverian> procrastinating..

[00:59] <Juerd> What's that?

[00:59] <wolverian> putting off something by distracting yourself with something else

[01:00] <Juerd> Ah, I did that all day without knowing there was a word for it :)

[01:00] <wolverian> :)

[01:00] <Juerd> Spent half a day rewiring parts of my car. Should have done taxes.

[01:00] <ayrnieu> procrastination also refers to a kind of clever task management.

[01:00] <Juerd> I'm going to bed now

[01:01] <Juerd> Thanks for helping me with the colour issue

[01:01] <Juerd> And thanks for delaying my sleep with that ;)

[13:11] <fglock> hi! - I'm trying to commit the $0,$1 implementation - but got to merge first :(

[13:12] <ruoso> fglock, is the "Not an ARRAY" error related to that?

[13:13] <fglock> ruoso: looking...

[13:14] <fglock> ruoso: that's a problem with the match{state}, which is an internal variable - it should never happen

[13:15] <ruoso> fglock, only when you mix old with new code... :)

[13:15] <ruoso> fglock, how the state should looks like...

[13:15] <ruoso> fglock, so I can wrap it...

[13:16] <fglock> ruoso: state is an array with [ number, state ]

[13:18] <Aragone> (btw, you do know that the concat function in Pugs::Runtime::Rule2 in the released PCR 0.01 on cpan is mangled?)

[13:19] <svnbot6> r9677 | fglock++ | pX/../PCR - $0, $1

[13:20] <fglock> Aragone: looking...

[13:21] <fglock> Aragone: looks ok - http://search.cpan.org/src/FGLOCK/Pugs-Compiler-Rule-0.01/lib/Pugs/Runtime/Rule2.pm

[13:21] <fglock> but this file is gone in the new version

[13:21] <fglock> work &

[13:21] <Aragone> it tries to recurse to Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5::concat()

[13:21] <Aragone> though

[13:21] <Aragone> (it's fixed in the new version)

[13:22] <Aragone> rather than itself

[13:22] *** kanru joined
[13:23] <ruoso> fglock, I see that 'push @list, rule' now pushes a string instead of a sub...

[13:23] <ruoso> in PCR

[13:25] <ruoso> fglock, I'm a little bit confused..

[13:28] <fglock> ruoso: the list is processed into method calls in the end of Pugs::Grammar::Rule

[13:28] <ruoso> fglock, ah ok

[13:29] <ruoso> fglock, this should be changed, shouldn't it?

[13:30] * ruoso getting back to Perl6::Bible to see how the syntax should looks like

[13:31] <svnbot6> r9679 | pmurias++ | $grammar_namespace now passed to the PCR emitter

[13:32] <fglock> ruoso: there are 2 kinds of rules in PCR: methods and objects. @list expects a list of objects - so we need to curry the methods into rule-objects. I don't know if this is correct

[13:33] <ruoso> fglock, so... the emitted code should already wrap it...

[13:33] <ruoso> fglock, and push @list, \&rule... would just work

[13:34] <fglock> ruoso: yes, but Pugs::Grammar::Rule is a bit odd (it's not emitted automatically)

[13:35] <ruoso> fglock, but it should represent the same thing, shouldn't it?

[13:36] <fglock> ruoso: [OT] where does gnome mounts a SMB share?

[13:36] <ruoso> fglock, it doesn't

[13:37] <ruoso> fglock, that's the great shit of gnome vfs

[13:37] <ruoso> fglock, and that's why I pray for hurd every day on my like

[13:37] <ruoso> s/like/life/

[13:37] <fglock> ruoso: it represents the same thing, at high level - put p5 can't have method==object

[13:38] <pmurias> ruoso: ever heard of FUSE?

[13:39] *** elmex joined
[13:39] <ruoso> pmurias, yes... Yeat Another Linux Kernel Dirty Hack

[13:40] <ruoso> fglock, but... are rule methods accessed any other way than as rule objects?

[13:42] <fglock> ruoso: $grammar->rule() vs. $rule()

[13:44] <ruoso> fglock, ah ok... I got confused again...

[13:46] <ruoso> so... push @list, rule should have a different syntax, shouldn't it?

[13:47] <ruoso> or one could tie @list to something that makes it work

[13:48] <fglock> ruoso: not sure - I think it should just be emitted in a different way

[13:49] *** kisu joined
[13:49] <ruoso> fglock, tie in the emitted code

[13:50] <ruoso> turn "my Rule @list;" into the tie code...

[13:50] <ruoso> fglock, what do you think?

[13:52] * ruoso thinking again

[13:57] <ruoso> fglock, in "my $rule = rule { ... }"... which value would have $rule?

[14:02] <fglock> ruoso: $rule is a Pugs::Compiler::Rule object

[14:03] <ruoso> fglock, so... doesn't $grammar->rule->() makes sense?

[14:06] <ruoso> pmurias, named captures already are written as $<name>

[14:06] <ruoso> pmurias, this is one of the problems

[14:09] <fglock> ruoso: what if I mix objects and methods in @array?

[14:11] <ruoso> fglock, good question...

[14:16] <ruoso> fglock, I added a 'return '' unless defined $n;' in P::E::R::P5::emit_rule

[14:17] <ruoso> before the die "unknown node"

[14:18] <fglock> ruoso: but that is an error in the AST - you should emit a warning

[14:18] <pmurias> i'll take a break from the computer now, if someone check why does the make program AST leak into the PCR while compiling Rules.p6 I'll be gratefull

[14:18] <ruoso> fglock, hmmm... I noticed it now...

[14:18] <ruoso> fglock, the rules simply were not there... :)

[14:29] <ruoso> unknown node: $VAR1 = '\\(';

[14:30] <fglock> ruoso: escaped chars are not defined yet in PCR - see the 'XXX' in the grammar

[14:30] <ruoso> fglock, oh... ouch...

[14:30] <ruoso> fglock, any workaround?

[14:31] <fglock> ruoso: I can implement it - one sec

[14:48] <ruoso> fglock, nice... thanks...

[17:20] *** willie0220 left
[17:20] <ruoso> fglock, it generated this code... and it causes error...

[17:21] <fglock> p6ws returns a match object - $$match returns the data structure

[17:21] <ruoso> fglock, hmmm...

[17:21] <ruoso> fglock, it says 'Not a SCALAR reference'

[17:21] *** SamB joined
[17:21] *** nothingmuch joined
[17:22] <fglock> ruoso: don't reuse the p6ws method in the rule grammar - it was generated by the 'broken' PCR/lrep

[17:22] <fglock> did you compile p6ws yourself?

[17:22] <ruoso> fglock, no

[17:23] <ruoso> fglock, I still need to recompile the lrep grammar

[17:23] <ruoso> fglock, if p6ws shouldn't be used, what should be?

[17:23] <ruoso> fglock, or should I define a new p6ws method?

[17:24] <fglock> ruoso: we'll need to write a grammar compiler, in order to fix PCR::Rule

[17:24] <fglock> ruoso: yes, defining the method yourself will be fine

[17:24] <ruoso> fglock, lrep is a grammar compiler...

[17:24] <ruoso> fglock, ok

[17:25] <fglock> ruoso: but it doesn't use PCR, so PCR thinks it's broken
