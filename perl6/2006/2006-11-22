[17:37] <ingy> thanks nothingmuch

[17:37] <ingy> nothingmuch: I had this idea

[17:37] <nothingmuch> aye

[17:38] <ingy> do you have time to discuss?

[17:38] <nothingmuch> yes

[17:38] <ingy> I want to support an alternate mode of M::C

[17:38] <ingy> so instead of .pm -> .pmc

[17:38] <ingy> something else

[17:38] <ingy> before I was thinking .p -> .pm

[17:39] <ingy> but now I think src/Foo.pm -> lib/Foo.pm

[17:39] <nothingmuch> sounds useful

[17:39] <ingy> the problem is where to put the src in blib (thus installation)

[17:40] <nothingmuch> Foo.pm.src?

[17:40] <ingy> blib/lib/Foo.pms?

[17:40] <ingy> ooh

[17:40] <ingy> not bad at all

[17:40] <ingy> I like your idea

[17:40] <nothingmuch> just keep the mapping function pluggable

[17:41] <nothingmuch> given a base dir and a sub path

[17:41] <ingy> nod

[17:41] <nothingmuch> map the sub path to something else

[17:41] <ingy> WWDPD?

[17:41] <nothingmuch> letting the base dir be the same (in the pm -> .pmc case) or different (in the src -> lib case)

[17:41] <nothingmuch> who is DP?

[17:41] <ingy> what would Data::Package do?

[17:41] <nothingmuch> ih

[17:41] <nothingmuch> oh

[17:41] <nothingmuch> i dunno

[17:42] <ingy> ok, well unless DP has a better idea I'll go with yours

[17:42] <ingy> thanks

[17:42] <ingy> *kiss*

[17:42] <nothingmuch> what does it actually do?

[17:42] <nothingmuch> *kiss*

[17:43] <nothingmuch> i mean, i know it's some abstract whatever to put data on the CPAN

[17:43] <ingy> yeah, I need to look into it

[17:44] <nothingmuch> i think it's more of a base role type thing

[17:45] <nothingmuch> ingy: are you in .tw yet?

[17:45] <ingy> yet?

[17:45] <nothingmuch> i heard you mention something about looking for crashspace

[17:45] <ingy> am I supposed to be?

[17:45] <nothingmuch> i figured you were going to move there for a while again

[17:45] <ingy> oh

[17:46] <ingy> I want to go there for a few weeks near YAPC::Asia

[17:46] <nothingmuch> ah

[17:46] <ingy> I'll also be at Wikimania there in August

[17:46] <ingy> hot!

[17:46] <nothingmuch> humid!

[17:47] <nothingmuch> not very sexy!

[17:47] <ingy> maybe I'll just walk around in my undies

[19:39] <pmurias> nothingmuch: what's your experience with narrative javascript? would you recommend it for production work?

[19:39] <nothingmuch> no experience at all except "oOh! shiny!"

[19:40] <pmurias> well at least it's better than "oOh! yucky!" :)
