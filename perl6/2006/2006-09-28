[05:19] <audreyt> * Unicode support for the embedded Perl5 bridge.  (This takes effect iff

[05:19] <audreyt>   the embedded Perl supports SvUTF8_on, typically Perl 5.8+.)

[05:19] <audreyt>   - Source code in eval('...', :lang<perl5>) can now contain non-ASCII

[05:19] <audreyt>     characters; they are treated as if "use utf8;" is in effect.

[05:19] <audreyt>   - Str objects passing from Pugs land into Perl 5 are always turned

[05:20] <audreyt>     into SvUTF8_on unicode strings.

[05:20] <audreyt>   - Strings passed from Perl 5 to Pugs land are always converted into

[05:20] <audreyt>     Unicode Str objects for now; this may be relaxed once we have a

[05:20] <audreyt>     native Buf type in Pugs land.

[05:20] <audreyt>   - Both named and unnamed regexes now assumes Unicode semantics.

[05:20] <audreyt> * Use New()/Safefree() instead of malloc()/free() in p5embed APIs.

[05:20] <audreyt> * Use svpvn and CStringLen instead of svpv and CString, so strings with

[05:20] <audreyt>   embedded nulls can be safely passed either way.

[05:20] <audreyt> * In non-embedded builds, call binmode(STDIN, ':utf8') only on

[05:20] <audreyt>   Perl 5.7 or later.

[13:18] <Juerd> Ehhh

[13:18] <Juerd> I think xx in ITEM context should croak.

[13:18] <Juerd> xx is list repetition. It makes no sense in non-list context. If someone uses xx in non-list context, they could be meaning one of three things:

[13:19] <Juerd> 1. They really wanted to use x, but don't understand the difference yet. If they only stringify the array, they will find that somehow the repetition operator added whitespace.

[13:19] <Juerd> 2. They needed to use an @array, not a $string, but don't understand the difference yet. They won't find out the difference :)

[13:20] <Juerd> 3. They really did want an array. In this case, I think they needed to be explicit about it, and use [].

[13:20] <Juerd> To summarize:

[13:21] <Juerd> * \W operators should not create arrays in item context. If there's no good item context behaviour, croak.

[19:19] <ajs_work> I'm constantly leafing through the files in docs/Perl6/Spec, and still I get pretty badly confused by the names. Would it be wrong of me to change them to S01_Overview.pod, S02_Syntax.pod, etc., or is that going to throw something off (I know I'd have to update the "update" script too)?

[20:16] <TreyHarris> ajs_work: update, and smartlinks, and smokeserv... you're probably best off just grepping through the pugs tree looking for /S\d\d[.](?:pod|html/ and /(:?Overview|Syntax|Subroutine|Rule|...)[.](:?pod|html)/ to see what else might use it...

[21:57] <schroeer> hello?! my first visit to irc.

[21:57] <schroeer> I am having a problem to build pugs on Linux:

[21:58] <schroeer> The things in the third-party directory

[21:59] <schroeer> are built to dist/build/cbits/cbits/ instead of dist/build/cbits/

[21:59] <schroeer> and then the build system doesn't find the anymore.

[22:00] <schroeer> them anymore.

[22:01] <schroeer> Goodbye
