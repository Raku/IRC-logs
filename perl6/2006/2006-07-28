[09:16] <gaal> and that I have activity in windows 3 and 5

[09:16] <agentzh> how to activate the window?

[09:16] <gaal> if I do /win 3, I'll go to window 3.. there I can go back to /win 2 for this channel

[09:16] <agentzh> oh, that's what i need. thanks!

[09:16] <gaal> if a number is red, I have a message addressed to me

[09:17] <agentzh> yes, i see a red "4"

[09:17] <agentzh> activating...

[19:38] <Limbic_Region> but WRT "always having it" - it is a virus and it can be gotten rid of - alternatively, it can remain dormant in B cells indefinately - so a re-ocurrence can either be a new infection or old friends coming to haunt you later
