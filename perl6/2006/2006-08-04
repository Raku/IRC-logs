[00:20] <rodi> everything made sense until that one :-D

[00:20] <mugwump> it's an implicit argument

[00:25] <ludan> it's fantastic

[00:25] <ludan> but not so easy to read at the first impact :/

[00:26] <mugwump> perl has always been a bit like that...

[00:26] <ludan> yep :P

[00:26] <mugwump> but the funny thing is, which parts you find easy to read and which seem natural depend on your background

[00:26] <mugwump> to a ruby programmer, the pointy sub notation ( -> $x { ... }) would seem very natural

[00:27] <ludan> for me it's the first time

[00:27] <ludan> but in your opinion, it's better to have (1..4) -> $x than $x ( 1 .. 4 ) ?

[09:19] <sqd> changed*

[09:20] <nothingmuch> FYI, this channel is for perl 6 discussion, not perl help

[09:20] <nothingmuch> what's dk42?

[09:20] <sqd> it's a js function

[09:20] <nothingmuch> that you're parsing??

[09:22] <sqd> I'm not familiar with that function

[09:22] <nothingmuch> okay, nevermind

[09:22] <nothingmuch> so you're trying to not match the additional ' + ' ?

[09:22] <sqd> script 1 was changed and is working now

[09:22] <sqd> and I need to convert wcript 2

[09:23] <nothingmuch> the perl is just matching

[09:23] <sqd> dk42 was replaced by write in js

[09:24] <sqd> js: dk42( unescape( 'some key' ) ) 	perl: ~ /dk42\( unescape\( '([^']+)/;

[09:24] <sqd> js: + write( unescape( 'some key' ) )      perl: this is the question ;)

[09:24] <nothingmuch> oh

[09:26] <nothingmuch> yep

[09:26] <nothingmuch> but be careful

[09:26] <nothingmuch> that'll also replace dk42( in strings

[09:26] <sqd> there is no dk42 in new js

[09:26] <nothingmuch> i menat in the old js

[09:26] <sqd> there is "write" instead of "dk42

[09:26] <nothingmuch> to do a 100% safe find/replace you need to parse the js with a grammar

[09:27] <nothingmuch> and replace only the function call nodes

[09:27] <sqd> old is working, I need to fix the new one

[09:27] <azuroth> does < and > work in perl regex like in vim..? ^_^;

[09:27] <nothingmuch> oh

[09:27] <nothingmuch> so do you want to replace all the write() to dk42() ?

[09:27] <sqd> no no

[09:28] <nothingmuch> the nopaste, anyway

[09:28] <nothingmuch> just matching

[09:28] <sqd> and I don't know how to fix that in perl

[09:29] <gaal> nothingmuch: shoot

[09:29] <azuroth> it captures the key in ()s?

[09:29] <nothingmuch> gaal: #moose?

[09:29] <gaal> you got it

[09:30] <sqd> nothingmuch what makes this line: $line =~ m#\+ write\( unescape\( '([^']+)#)  with this js: dk42( unescape( 'some key' ) )  ?

[09:30] <nothingmuch> sqd: i don't understand the question

[09:31] <sqd> to get "a key" form the website I have to use perl script

[09:32] <sqd> in the js on the website was a piece: dk42( unescape( 'some key' ) )

[09:32] <sqd> respective perl script to get the key was: ($line =~ m#dk42[^']*'([^']*)'#)

[09:32] <sqd> now the js on the website was changed to: + write( unescape( 'some key' ) ) +

[09:33] <sqd> and respective working perl script to get the key is: ($line =~ m#\+ write\( unescape\( '([^']+)#)

[09:33] <sqd> my question is:

[09:33] <sqd> I have another perl script to get that key

[09:33] <cmarcelo> I did a "./make_build_perl5; perl util/src_to_blib.pl", make install and then tried perl t/01-sanity/01-tap.t and got a lot of errors like: String found where operator expected at t/01-sanity/01-tap.t line 6, near "say '1..10'" (Do you need to predeclare say?)

[09:33] <sqd> for old js version is was: $line=~ /dk42\( unescape\( '([^']+)/;

[09:34] <cmarcelo> anyone knows what is causing this?

[09:34] <sqd> how to change the second perl script to work for the new js.

[09:35] <azuroth> just change the dk42 to write?

[09:35] <sqd> no

[09:35] <sqd> it doesn't work

[10:11] <sqd> script 1 was fixed and is working, i have to do the same with script2

[10:12] <azuroth> it should just be the same as script 1

[10:12] <sqd> azuroth script 2 doesn't exist

[10:13] <azuroth> well script 1 should do everything that script 2 has to

[10:13] <sqd> that's the problem

[10:13] <sqd> azuroth right

[10:13] <sqd> script 1 was already fixed

[10:13] <sqd> the problem is with script2

[10:16] <sqd> in script 1 is a function dk42, in script 2 is write

[10:17] <azuroth> hmm, okay... how is it a problem with script 2 if script 2 doesn't exist? :S

[13:15] <kolibrie> I would like to try out v6.pm, and tried clkao's instructions at http://use.perl.org/~clkao/journal/30407

[13:15] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of clkao (1687)

[13:15] <kolibrie> unfortunately, make build_perl5 seems to not find Data::Bind and other modules under pugs/perl5

[13:16] <kolibrie> and util/prove6 t/01-sanity says:

[13:16] <kolibrie> bash: util/prove6: /bin/perl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

[13:16] <kolibrie> do I need to set some environment variable or path so that the modules under perl5 are found?

[13:17] <cmarcelo> kolibrie: about prove6, you can change the first line to match your perl location... i.e., /usr/bin/perl

[13:17] <cmarcelo> first line of util/prove6 script

[13:18] <kolibrie> cmarcelo: hmm, well, now that appears to run, but the 01-sanity says...dubious

[13:18] <kolibrie> t/01-sanity...pugs: t/01-sanity: openFile: inappropriate type (is a directory)

[13:18] <cmarcelo> ops

[13:19] <cmarcelo> try with t/01-sanity/*.t

[13:20] <kolibrie> cmarcelo: yes, that seems to work nicely

[13:20] <kolibrie> cmarcelo: yes, except for two which were skipped

[13:45] <fglock> cpan version

[13:46] * kolibrie thought that since he already had the pugs tree, that would be easier

[13:46] <fglock> please install Cache::Cache also

[13:47] <kolibrie> that makes it faster, I presume?

[16:44] <[particle]> how will C<rule dbi_ns { ::DBI }> parse? is :: a cut marker or ns sigil?

[16:45] <fglock> {} is a closure, so it's a sigil

[16:45] <fglock> oops, no

[16:46] *** Corion_ joined
[16:46] <fglock> the rule is ' ::DBI ', so it's a cut marker

[16:48] * [particle] is running nmake install again, to be sure

[16:50] <PerlJam> fglock, [particle]: having a cut marker at  the beginning of a pattern is weird.

[16:51] <[particle]> i think '::' as a sigil is weird

[16:51] <clkao> PerlJam: if it's not on svktodo then there's not. perhaps i wrote something on the mailing list

[16:51] <[particle]> how does C<rule { $x }> parse? (sigil or eol?)

[16:53] <fglock> $x interpolates to a string or to a subrule

[16:53] <[particle]> right. so does ::foo interpolate to something?

[16:54] *** DaGo joined
[16:55] <clkao> TimToady: ok... so the parser has to change the way parsing when it sees infix:<orz> defined

[16:55] <[particle]> what if i have C< grammar foo; ...; package bar; rule baz { ::foo };> ?

[16:55] <PerlJam> ::foo should probably warn IMHO

[16:56] <[particle]> :: is also a sigil for grammar (as per S02)

[16:56] <[particle]> can a grammar be inside a rule?

[16:56] <[particle]> if not, s/grammar/enum/

[16:57] <[particle]> i don't see a clear answer

[16:59] <PerlJam> I thought the only uses of :: as sigil were in declarations and as ::(...) for interpolation

[17:00] *** tup joined
[17:00] <[particle]> hrmm

[17:00] <[particle]> so rule { ::(foo) }

[17:00] <[particle]> still ambiguous

[17:00] <TimToady> TreyHarris: yes, 0 but True should work.

[17:03] <TreyHarris> ok.  hopefully i'll be able to write a test soon.  supposedly, the application just needs final approval in general counsel's office or somesuch...  the past few weeks have been really excruciating, seeing all these things i want to contribute and not being able to... :-)

[17:03] *** frederico joined
[17:03] * [particle] wonders if s/True/true/ might work

[17:05] <[particle]> it doesn't have to be empty in front of the ::

[17:05] <[particle]> foo::bar(baz)

[17:06] <TimToady> clkao: yes all function definitions mutate the language to some degree.  As a kind of macro, installing an infix is required to have only lexical scope.

[17:06] <PerlJam> we have whitespace disambiguation for that.

[17:06] <PerlJam> foo::bar (:: is never cut),  foo :: bar (:: is always cut)

[17:07] <[particle]> but rules are ws sensitive

[17:07] <[particle]> so, i suppose you need <?wb> disambiguation

[17:07] <TimToady> what do you mean by ws sensitive?

[17:08] <[particle]> what's the modifier... :sigspace

[17:08] <TimToady> the inside of a rule works the same way as the outside, linguistically speaking--we still follow longest-token rule.  It's just a different language

[17:08] <TimToady> :sigspace gives extra significance to whitespace.

[17:08] <clkao> i wonder if/how PCR can handle this

[17:09] <TimToady> so ::foo should be reserved for types, in case we ever want to bind a type:  ::foo := (...) somehow.

[17:09] <[particle]> clkao: the parser should handle that

[17:09] <TimToady> basically, I think backtrack controllers should almost always have a space after them.

[17:09] <TimToady> much like label colons

[17:10] <[particle]> oh, label colons have required post-space? wasn't aware of that

[17:10] <clkao> ya, i know it should. just wonder if we can already handle it

[17:10] <[particle]> oh, *already*

[17:11] <[particle]> well, longest token rule works for me. i should have thought of that.

[17:12] <PerlJam> [particle]: yeah, it's hard to keep everything in your head at once though :)

[17:12] <[particle]> and if you really want to be clear, <'::'>foo

[17:12] <[particle]> pj: this is why i ask questions :)
