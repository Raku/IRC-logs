[00:52] <coignard> is there a support group for people who just started learning perl6 syntax?  I think I need psych. help :)

[00:53] <ayrnieu> We also provide psychic services.

[00:53] <ayrnieu> I can see, for instance, that you want to get Perl6::Bible ; you should give in to this desire.

[00:53] <coignard> that's what I am reading

[00:54] <coignard> I am only at s02

[00:54] * ayrnieu : verified again!

[00:54] <coignard> heh

[00:56] <coignard> how good is that ORA book on perl6?

[00:57] <coignard> is it worth the money?

[00:57] <ayrnieu> I haven't read it.  I think that one chapter is online, however.

[00:57] <ayrnieu> wait, do you mean Perl 6 Now?

[00:58] <coignard> http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/059600737X/index.html

[00:59] <ayrnieu> could you just say the title?  My environment is a bit odd, right now.

[01:00] <coignard> Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials, Second Edition

[01:00] <coignard> 2004

[01:00] <coignard> it should be really dated (2004), no?

[01:08] <svnbot6> r9741 | fglock++ | pX/PCR/opp.pl - namespace fix

[01:09] <ayrnieu> sorry, I didn't understand that question.

[01:10] <stevan_> coignard: Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials, Second Edition is very very dated by now

[01:10] <stevan_> probably not worth the money

[01:10] <ayrnieu> It depends on how much your money is worth, and what use you intend it for.

[01:11] <stevan_> not very thick book,.. might be able to help straighten out a wobbly chair :)

[01:12] <stevan_> not enough pages to keep a fire going for long

[01:17] <stevan_> it does make a good cup coaster though

[01:48] <svnbot6> r9742 | Darren_Duncan++ | ext/Rosetta/ : fleshed out the SeeAlso.pod and updated the SEE ALSO of all other files

[01:49] <dduncan> and now I'm committing right to the svk mirror this time, which is directly, rather than to an svk local copy and then pushing to the mirror ... that's really been too troublesome with spurious non or false merges

[16:48] <gabor529> what is the plan for basename, dirname and calls such as copy/move/rename ? Are they planned to be included in the language

[16:49] <gabor529> or will they be in one standard library or scattered around in several modules as in Perl5 ?

[17:34] <wolverian> how is the ?? !! operator defined in perl6? i.e. how can I define it myself?

[17:34] <wolverian> also, how are chaining operators (1 < $x < 5) defined?

[17:35] <wolverian> couldn't find them in the AES

[17:35] <wolverian> (except in S03, which doesn't mention the declaration)

[17:40] <audreyt> wolverian:  ternary:<?? !!>

[17:41] <audreyt> wolverian: infix:< == > is assoc<chaining>

[17:42] <audreyt> TimToady: S06's table has "assoc<chain>" but all examples "assoc<chaining>"

[17:42] <audreyt> should I update the table?

[17:42] <wolverian> audreyt, thanks.

[17:42] <fglock> audreyt: hi!

[17:42] <audreyt> hey!

[17:43] <wolverian> audreyt, I thought listfix:<?? !!> could work as well (if that's actually an official category), and would generalise the n-ary operators.

[17:43] <audreyt> I'm packing up for Tokyo

[17:43] <audreyt> wolverian: in OpTable there is explicit support for ternary but not listfix...

[17:43] <wolverian> (although I don't think we have any n-ary operators where n > 2 except ?? !!)

[17:43] <audreyt> also listfix could be conufsed with assoc<list>

[17:43] <audreyt> like Y and ,

[17:43] <nothingmuch> doooes feather have a blead perl

[17:43] <nothingmuch> ?

[17:44] <wolverian> audreyt, yeah, right. I actually missed your assoc<chaining> line, sorry

[17:44] <fglock> audreyt: I implemented a naive operator precedence parser using rules in pX/PCR/opp.pl - it uses templates for the syntax constructs

[17:44] <audreyt> fglock: yeah, Isaw that

[17:44] <audreyt> I hope .jp can fix my jetlagging... for the entire week I sleep in 3hr segments :/

[17:45] <wolverian> oh well, I guess infix:<?? !!> has no hope of working :)

[17:45] <audreyt> wolverian: indeed

[17:45] <wolverian> it would have nicely generalised to infix:<a b c d ...>. it's not that important, though.. the syntactic construct of an n-ary operator where each op(n) is different is rather mindblowing.

[17:46] <wolverian> (I would be fine if we didn't have ?? !! at all.)

[17:47] <fglock> can I use 'is parsed' for normal subs (non macros)?

[17:51] <ingy> hi audreyt

[17:51] <audreyt> fglock: that'd be unspecced I think... and you'll get back a fragment not a normal arg

[19:54] <Juerd> TimToady: I don't think interpreting $foo as a rule *breaks* $1, it just changes what it does. And since almost everything in regexes-->rules changes, I see no problem with that at all. Using $1 bare could easily emit a warning that you probably meant to say "$1" instead.

[19:54] *** KingDiamond joined
[19:55] <Juerd> TimToady: As for turning "everything" into a metacharacter, I know that this has been your stance for a long time, and I agree. However, when metacharacters come entirely natural (quoting something to get it literal is quite familiar to users of shells and the new <<...>>), it shouldn't be a problem.

[19:57] <fglock> pmurias:re %hash - Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5 - line 122 is the place for '%hash'; line 195 is the place for '<%hash>'; at runtime you call 'get_variable()' to get a reference to the hash - see the '<$var>' implementation in line 209

[20:03] <pmurias> fglock: were should I put tests for it?

[20:09] <Juerd> TimToady: And the confusion between the verbs "quoting" and "escaping" stems from how this works in many (mini)languages :)

[20:09] <Juerd> TimToady: It'd be useful if in regexes, quoting and escaping also did the same thing: protect against interpretation as rule.
