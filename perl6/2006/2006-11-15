[00:29] <TimToady> which might explain why evalbot eventually exited with a read error

[01:19] <diakopter> I wasn't thinking of how well the test cover the synopses, or how well the implementations cover the tests, or how well the tests cover the implementations, but on how well the implementation covers the synopses.

[01:19] <TimToady> hmm, 3 John would be Jude...

[01:19] <TimToady> 3 John 2 rather

[01:20] <TimToady> It always bugged me that books with only one chapter left out the 1:

[01:20] <chip> odd the kinds of inconsistencies that nag

[04:14] <dduncan> I tried something different and got it to work in my own pugs

[04:14] <dduncan> in any event, it seems that my Perl 5 isn't doing split() properly, as far as I can tell ... trying to split on a vertical bar just splits as if it were an empty string ... each character becomes its own array element ... very weird

[04:15] <dduncan> does the vertical bar have some special meaning in a literal string in Perl 5?

[04:17] *** f0rth_ joined
[04:17] <chip> dduncan: it has a special meaning in a regex

[04:18] <dduncan> yes, but I said "split '|', @ary"

[04:18] <dduncan> does split change that literal string into a regex?

[04:18] <chip> dduncan: quote or slash, split works with regexes

[04:19] *** fayland__ is now known as fayland

[04:20] <dduncan> in any event, I discovered that pugs treated the split argument as a literal string ... or the | was taken literally in Perl 6 regexes

[04:20] <dduncan> separately ...

[04:21] <chip> dduncan: perldoc -f split for the gory details, including the special case of split ' '

[04:21] <dduncan> I noticed that my Pugs now does certain things that used to require readline to do, such as up-arrow command repetition

[10:44] <Tokay> morning

[10:44] <Tokay> i don't know anything about perl, can you have embedded php?

[10:46] <Alias_> Can you embed PHP in Perl?

[10:46] <Alias_> Yes

[10:46] <Tokay> i made a random charactor script in php, someone has a perl script

[10:46] <Tokay> validation script that is

[10:47] <Tokay> or maybe i need to embed the perl into the php script

[10:47] <Tokay> i'll have a play

[10:47] <Alias_> That seems terribly drastic

[10:47] <Alias_> embedding like that is not something to do lightly

[10:47] <Tokay> ok

[10:47] <Alias_> You know, that's probably a Perl module that does random characters for you

[10:47] <Tokay> well i suppose i could convert the checking part of the script into perl

[10:47] <Alias_> there's

[10:48] <Alias_> On CPAN I'm sure there's a random string generator

[10:48] <Tokay> no i make the script and someone wants to use it with a script written in perl

[10:48] <Tokay> made*

[10:49] <Alias_> Well, if you absolutely have to, use PHP::Interpreter

[10:49] <Alias_> (the CPAN module)

[10:49] <Alias_> http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PHP::Interpreter

[10:49] <Tokay> i might aswell convert it into perl

[10:49] <lambdabot> Title: PHP::Interpreter - An embedded PHP5 interpreter - search.cpan.org, http://tinyurl.com/y9x7nw

[10:50] <Alias_> Tokay: Almost certainly you want to port it

[10:50] <Tokay> http://phpfi.com/174897

[10:50] <Alias_> PHP::Interpreter is mainly for large apps where clients insist on PHP templating support

[10:50] <lambdabot> Title: nopaste: pastebin with syntax highlighting

[10:50] <Tokay> that's all i need to convert, i'm sure perl can use post

[10:51] <Tokay> want to learn perl anyway

[10:52] <Alias_> Porting can be good for that

[10:52] <Tokay> porting?

[16:40] <PerlJam> well ... more like "prefect" in the sense that I can bend my mind around it when necessary such that I've come to think in perl occasionally.

[16:42] <TimToady> point is, "blurfl" may express my thoughts perfectly, but it doesn't communicate

[16:42] *** eggzeck[laptop] joined
[16:44] *** klausen joined
[16:45] *** andara joined
[16:45] <TimToady> you know, if we want Perl 6 to succeed, all we have to do is start the rumor that it was separately designed by 70 hermit/scholars who then came together and found that their results agreed perfectly.

[16:54] <lde> TimToady: everyone said "lisp"? ;-)

[16:56] * sjn would like to propose a new Perl6 meme: "Reverseengineerability"

[16:58] *** aufrank joined
[16:58] <aufrank> hi hi

[16:58] <TimToady> reversible transformations are definitely one of the things we're thinking about.

[16:58] <TimToady> howdy

[16:59] <lde> the best thing that could be done is making obfuscators programmers life a bit harder i guess

[16:59] <aufrank> does anyone know of a debian package for ghc 6.6 that will give me a ghc suitable for building pugs?

[17:00] <sjn> how about reversible compilation? (i.e. s/language compilation/language translation/g)

[17:00] *** thepler joined
[17:00] <aufrank> I'm on ubuntu.  I installed the ghc 6.6 from debian unstable, but it didn't have the extralibs built

[17:01] <TimToady> sjn: you have to be careful not to throw away important information to be fully reversible.  And certainly there are poeple who want to throw away the information because it contains trade secrets.

[17:01] <TimToady> *people

[17:02] <aufrank> nm, actually read the ghc download page

[17:03] * sjn is more concerned with making free software easier to dissect and understand :)

[17:03] <TimToady> Ide: I've worked on some of the obfuscated examples in pugs/examples, and it does appear that it's slightly harder to obfuscate in P6.  At least, the examples in question were more readable.  Balancing that is that the examples were just using P5 idioms rather than P6.

[17:04] <TimToady> sjn: if the author agrees to that, we should try to help.  but I think we shouldn't force it on people.

[17:04] <TimToady> I just want Perl to be useful, and that includes proprietary as well as free software.

[17:06] <sjn> no forcing is necessary. just like everyone is free to strip(1) symbols from a compiled program... :)

[17:06] <TimToady> I am, after all, part of the reason we ended up with the term "open source" as distinct from "free software".

[17:07] <TimToady> so I believe in it for practical reasons more than ideological reasons.

[20:38] <nothingmuch> moose =)

[20:44] <gaal> @tell nothingmuch #parrot confirms it's T:H:Straps; ++ for fixaround if you got one else I'll do it tomorrow evening

[20:45] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[20:45] <[particle]> gaal: has there been talk of improving the smokeserver?

[20:45] <[particle]> it's hard to trace one test across smokes, for example

[20:46] <[particle]> i think a moose could fix this in a jifty

[20:48] * dmq accelerates particle

[20:49] * [particle] hits a wall

[20:51] *** justatheory joined
[20:52] <dmq> arent particles supposed to go through the wall?

[20:52] <PerlJam> depends on the particle

[20:53] <PerlJam> (and how fast it's traveling)

[20:54] <[particle]> and what the wall's made of... darned magnetic bottles

[20:55] <PerlJam> Don't damage the Wall.

[20:58] <dmq> Bring down this wall!

[20:58] *** justatheory_ joined
[21:03] <gaal> Bring Wall the down (so he doesn't catch a cold)

[21:03] <gaal> [particle]: there has

[21:04] <gaal> one large improvement is that the TAP data is submitted serverside (used to be only the html was)

[21:04] <gaal> so applications like you suggest can actually be written.

[21:04] <[particle]> yay

[21:05] <gaal> see also Chimps on CPAN

[21:05] <gaal> I've been kinda out of things past month or two :(

[21:05] <gaal> but $project is ending and the next one is closer to home so hopefully, more hack time
