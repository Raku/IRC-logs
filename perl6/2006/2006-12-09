[06:04] <geoffb> Wheee, nothing like asking a question just as the entire IRC net is rebooted ....

[06:04] <geoffb> Let's try that again:

[06:04] <geoffb> Anyone happen to know the status of 6-on-5?  Is the (sub)project still alive?

[06:05] <geoffb> IIRC, the latest v6-alpha on CPAN is from September.

[06:14] *** norageek joined

[06:18] <Alias_> geoffb, it's still coming along, the component parts are being polished still

[06:18] <Alias_> Because I believe the run-time stuff is not trivial

[06:18] <geoffb> Alias_: nodnod

[06:18] *** Daveman joined
[06:19] <geoffb> Just trying to get an idea on when I can actually usefully convert the code I'm working on.  (And still have it running at fullish speed.)

[06:19] <Alias_> A while yet

[06:20] <geoffb> Sigh

[06:20] <Alias_> Well, you know what's involved in having Perl 6 run WITHOUT anyone ever installing Perl 6...

[06:20] <geoffb> Ah well, file me under "Still Life with Source Filter"

[06:20] <Alias_> Give it a few months

[06:21] <geoffb> Alias_: I have.  ;-)

[06:21] <Alias_> ... again

[06:21] <geoffb> Seriously though, just was wanting to get status, because none of the usual places to look said anything

[06:21] <geoffb> Pugs' STATUS document hasn't been updated in almost a year now.

[06:22] <Alias_> poke Audrey :)

[06:22] <geoffb> So I had no idea if things had completely stalled, or whether it was just bubbling behind the scenes

[06:22] <Alias_> They are probably been too busy boding for the last year

[06:22] <Alias_> coding

[06:22] <Alias_> Nah, not stalled at all

[06:22] <geoffb> I thought she was working tail off at $work?

[06:22] <Alias_> It moves ahead like the veritable freight train

[06:23] <geoffb> Schweet

[06:23] <Alias_> I believe the commit rate still describes an expodential curve

[06:23] <geoffb> Good.  As it should be.  :-)

[06:24] *** penk joined
[06:24] <Alias_> I believe the issue now is they are getting to the business end

[06:25] <geoffb> meaning?

[06:25] <Alias_> Making parrot, Perl 6 and the Perl 6 backends all line up, so to speak

[06:25] <Alias_> er

[06:25] <Alias_> parrot, Perl 5 and the...

[06:25] <Alias_> I lose track sometimes, it's  a veritable octopus of components

[06:25] <geoffb> Right, so finally getting the common point in the middle (the AST) to really be common ....

[06:25] <geoffb> heh

[06:25] <Alias_> Well

[06:26] <Alias_> Perl 6 -> ... -> Haskell is fine

[06:26] <Alias_> Perl 6 -> ... -> Perl 5/parrot is the trickier stuff

[06:26] <geoffb> gotcha

[06:26] <Alias_> But then parts of parrot are reaching up to replace bits of pugs, and downwards, and sideways, etc etc

[06:27] <Alias_> The next round of releasey type stuff should appear some time soon I suspect

[06:27] <geoffb> Somehow I have visions of black and white B- horror flicks

[06:27] <Alias_> But then only Audrey and Larry know for sure

[06:27] <Alias_> pretty much :)

[23:13] <fglock> geoffb: re status of 6-on-5

[23:14] <fglock> the current plan is to have 6-on-6, which compiles to perl5

[23:18] <fglock> 6-on-6 would be bootstrapped with mini-p6, which compiles to all backends

[23:19] <fglock> mini-p6 currently compiles to p5 and parrot. The p5 backend is bootstrapped

[23:21] *** rhizo joined
[23:23] <fglock> I think that bootstrapping on other backends would be nice, so I'm working on the parrot bootstrap

[23:24] <fglock> v6.pm and Pugs::Compiler::Rule are not meant to be abandoned - I'm looking for comaintainers

[23:27] <fglock> re "getting the common point in the middle (the AST) to really be common"

[23:28] <fglock> I don't think it is possible, as it would need the current compilers to be rewritten

[23:29] <fglock> 6-on-6 would be a common parser/common AST for several backends
