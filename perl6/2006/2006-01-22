[00:26] <svnbot6> r8769 | putter++ | Currently, the best one can do is  use Mumble; mumble_macro q_to_eof(); ... .

[00:26] <svnbot6> r8769 | putter++ | Which isn't much better than heredocs.  But the complexity cost is low - it's

[03:45] * audreyt posted mg.h patch to p5p

[03:45] * putter googles

[03:45] <audreyt> fixed 5.8.8rc1's swig interop problem yesterday

[03:45] <putter> ah :)

[03:45] <audreyt> http://perlcabal.org/~autrijus/tmp/mg.h.diff

[03:46] <audreyt> so I can use svk again

[03:46] <audreyt> good thing that this is caught in RC before it bites another person :)

[03:47] * audreyt proceeds to fix other svk/perl588 incompats

[03:47] <putter> sigh.  one word and boom.  thus the argument for biological-analog software.

[03:48] <audreyt> mm biological-analog.

[03:48] <putter> no idea

[03:49] <audreyt> it's been over a year with no press release or confs or anything

[03:50] <audreyt> okay, the svk side is fixed as well

[03:50] <audreyt> "svk sy" no longer segfaults ;)

[03:50] *** dduncan joined
[03:51] <dduncan> hello there

[03:51] <audreyt> dduncan: greetings!

[03:51] <dduncan> I am now running Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger for the first time

[03:51] <dduncan> yesterday it was 10.3.9

[03:51] <dduncan> so far so good

[03:51] <audreyt> wonderful

[03:51] <audreyt> so you can get svk installed? :)

[03:51] <dduncan> I still have to reinstall GHC and svk and such under the new system

[03:52] <dduncan> however, svk should be easier to do than before

[03:52] <dduncan> because the current package installers were Tiger-only before

[03:52] <dduncan> I had to do the package source to make it work under panther

[03:52] <audreyt> nodnod

[03:52] <dduncan> I don't anticipate problems, though

[03:53] <audreyt> putter++ # having a smoke ready for me so I don't have to run the loop first

[03:53] <audreyt> okay, back to triaging.

[03:53] *** tcliou joined
[03:54] <audreyt> ooh, hs' is made public. I can finally talk about it freely here :D

[03:54] <audreyt> # http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell-cafe/2006-January/014036.html

[03:55] <dduncan> audreyt, a comment on your latest journal entry

[03:55] <putter> actually, it's more than just ARPA.  US funding for research is starting to look.. almost european. ;)

[03:55] <dduncan> I saw the 5.8.8 change summary too

[03:56] <dduncan> and it looked mainly like the updates were putting in newer versions of bundled modules

[03:56] <audreyt> that happens every release

[03:56] <audreyt> but look at "Performance Enhancements ^" and "Performance Enhancements ^"

[03:57] <dduncan> can you name anything specific in the core that was particularly better?

[03:57] <dduncan> the other stuff I saw mentioned some refactoring, and that the binary is smaller than before

[03:58] <dduncan> is that it mainly, or are there actual feature/behaviour changes that are quite noticible?

[03:58] <audreyt> O(1) weakrefs; no redundant SVGV creation; aggresive "static" and "const"ing of core; utf8 under debugger no longer results in 100x slowdown

[03:58] <dduncan> I've used weakrefs and never understood that there was a speed problem with them

[03:58] <audreyt> if you used it in ithreads context, then you would

[03:58] <audreyt> <- deployed ithread application under mod_perl2 in Win32

[03:59] <dduncan> okay, if that 0(1) thing relates to ithreads ...

[03:59] <audreyt> anyway, this is a point release, so obviously there would be no features

[03:59] <dduncan> I haven't done any multithreaded stuff yet

[03:59] <dduncan> not even minor features?

[03:59] <putter> :)

[03:59] <dduncan> well, no matter

[03:59] <audreyt> no, I think the point of point releases is that minor features is only added if the old misfeature is too broken

[03:59] <audreyt> and as we are at 5.8.8, that probably doesn't happen

[03:59] <dduncan> I expect to test it soon enough

[04:00] <audreyt> oh, if you want to recompile svk with it (not likely, but in the off chance), I just posted a patch to p5p5

[04:00] <audreyt> http://perlcabal.org/~autrijus/tmp/mg.h.diff

[04:00] <audreyt> it should be merged in RC2

[04:00] <audreyt> (without that, swig fails)

[04:02] <dduncan> in the short term, I'm going to just install svk using the system perl (5.8.6 now) as last time (the svk installer didn't work when linking to my custom perl 5.8.7, in a nonstandard location, while I use the custom for everything else)

[04:02] <audreyt> that'd work merrily.

[04:03] <audreyt> wow, the #haskell people are crazy at this alioth thing

[04:03] <audreyt> I swore they were at 3rd place yesterday, now it's 2nd

[04:03] <audreyt> # http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all

[04:04] * audreyt ponders having a exapmles/shootout/

[04:06] <audreyt> anyway, lunch+triage first. bbiab &

[04:07] <putter> haskell - its never a problem to optimize... if you can bring the entire hs community to bear. ;)

[04:07] <audreyt> I think that's true for every free language :)

[04:10] <putter> :)  I wish I could see diffs over time of the implementations...

[04:10] <audreyt> (otoh, nonfree languages also have communities, and sometimes they can even write optimizers without access to code)

[15:29] <Alias_> feather?

[15:29] <wolverian> feather.perl6.nl

[15:30] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - I only need feather access from work which is where I can't connect to

[15:30] <webmind> Juerd, I think the unusability with high load might have an impact ?

[15:30] <Juerd> webmind: It might, but no-one except you has reported it to me, and I've yet to experience it.

[15:30] <wolverian> Juerd, I use it all the time to test pugs. 

[15:30] <Juerd> Besides, the load hasn't been high in a while.

[15:30] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - and I am not a Win32 or a *nix bigot - I use whatever is available

[15:30] <webmind> Juerd, care for the logs ?

[15:30] <Juerd> webmind: If that shows that it's unusably high, sure

[15:30] <Juerd> But high load and inavailability aren't the same thing.

[15:31] <webmind> well they tell you load and cpu usage

[15:31] <Juerd> Feather had a load of over 20 for days, a while ago, and was perfectly usable then.

[15:31] <webmind> ok

[15:31] <Juerd> Linux is quite capable of managing load

[15:31] <webmind> the k-line on efnet maybe then ?

[15:32] <webmind> hmm, not sure agree on that for workstations though

[15:34] <wolverian> s,fro mit,from it,

[15:34] <Juerd> So no, that c8an't be a reason.

[15:34] <Juerd> webmind: Why are you the only one who experiences this and mentions it?

[15:34] <Juerd> Have I done so badly to indicate that I'm available for comments and complaints? :(

[15:35] <webmind> Juerd, no I think it has more to do with human nature and not complaining

[15:35] <webmind> or actually more a cultural thing

[15:36] <webmind> but I'm just good at complaining :)

[15:36] <webmind> ah efnet works now yes.. there used to be a kline

[15:45] <lisppaste3> aufrank pasted "maybe a bug?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/15903

[15:45] <webmind> Juerd, well set a poll in the motd

[15:45] <webmind> or when it's really a problem mail to the list ?

[15:46] <webmind> or find a way to attract more perl6 coders

[15:46] <Juerd> webmind: "Why are you not using feather?" in feather's motd doesn't quite work ;)

[15:46] <webmind> ofcourse it could be that people are just using it more on their own hardware

[15:46] <Juerd> I have a list of mail addresses of users. I should start using it.

[15:47] <webmind> yep :)

[15:47] <Juerd> webmind: That's certainly possible.

[15:48] <rafl> Juerd: Re eu-geek-tour: Any news? Do you already know what you want to visit?

[15:49] <Juerd> rafl: I think I'll just do it, except for the cebit part. That's expensive and makes the entire tour last way too long.

[15:49] <rafl> Juerd: I'm also not that interested in cebit, so that's fine with me.

[15:49] <rafl> Juerd: Do you have a schedule?

[15:49] <Juerd> And going from .de to .nl and then back again is a little silly :)

[15:50] <rafl> Juerd: Indeed.

[15:50] <Juerd> rafl: Yep, hold on

[15:50] <Juerd> I should clip my nails.

[15:51] <rafl> That's what I'm telling me for almost two weeks now.

[15:51] <Juerd> It becomes harder to use a laptop keyboard as nails grow.

[15:51] <Juerd> Why do we have nails anyway? 

[15:51] <rafl> To scrape ourselfs?

[15:51] <wolverian> ask the intelligent design proponents.

[15:51] <integral> to peel the foil off the top of meals-for-one

[15:52] <Juerd> http://tnx.nl/4433BNBF

[15:52] <rafl> Or to chew them maybe..

[15:52] <Alias_> To praise the lord

[15:52] <Juerd> integral: I have a leatherman for that.

[15:52] <webmind> Juerd, imagine your fingers without them.. I think it would be less solid typing

[15:52] <lypanov> is the darcs repo up to date?

[15:52] <Alias_> To claw out the eyes of the heathen masses

[15:52] <webmind> also they help in opening packages and astuff

[15:52] <rafl> Juerd: So why don't you use it for that instead of punishing other people as you did in Berlin?

[15:52] <webmind> -a

[15:53] <Juerd> rafl: Because I'm a hacker.

[15:53] <Juerd> I use whatever tool is effective :)

[15:54] <rafl> Juerd: There are other tools that are more effective for that. And it would be even more effective for creating social connections not to harm anyone..

[15:55] <Juerd> rafl: There weren't that many tools around, IIRC :)

[15:55] <Juerd> rafl: And I don't think social connections were harmed :)

[15:57] <rafl> Juerd: Actually it was funny.. right.

[15:57] <Juerd> rafl: Anyway, what do you say re geektour :)

[15:57] <Juerd> Especially something on feb 27 or feb 28 would be nice :)

[15:57] <rafl> Juerd: I'll join. Do we have space for Timo?

[15:58] <Juerd> My car moves 4 people comfortably, 5 less so

[15:58] <Juerd> And I don't have any passengers registered yet

[15:58] <Juerd> So, yea

[15:58] <Juerd> webmind: Will you join? :)

[15:58] <rafl> Great. Then we also have someone that'll drive with us from Bochum to Chemnitz.

[15:58] <rafl> Juerd: So please register me. I'll ask Timo tomorrow.

[15:59] <rafl> Juerd: No idea that to do on 2{7,8}.2.

[15:59] <webmind> Juerd, not sure yet

[15:59] <Juerd> rafl: Do you have a driving license?

[15:59] <rafl> Juerd: We could can do a chemnitz perl mongers meeting in 6.3.

[15:59] <rafl> Juerd: No.

[15:59] <webmind> first thing I'm going to plan now is to let someone cut in my eyes

[16:00] <webmind> wellaaround them

[16:00] <Juerd> rafl: Especially Chemnitz -> Amsterdam is WAY too much for me alone.

[16:00] <webmind> and then plan around that

[16:00] <rafl> Juerd: Timo as well.

[16:00] <Juerd> rafl: Also no license?

[16:00] *** \xe6var joined
[16:00] <rafl> Juerd: Right.

[16:00] <Juerd> rafl: 6/3 is needed for the LONG drive

[16:01] <rafl> Juerd: How long will that take?

[16:01] <Juerd> rafl: 7 hours if all goes well

[16:02] <rafl> Juerd: OK, thats long. But we don't have any events on that day, so we can do a lot of breaks..

[16:02] *** penk joined
[16:03] <Juerd> rafl: Right, but still, even with breaks, it's quite a lot for one driver :)

[16:03] <Juerd> I'm willing to do it only if other people promise to not get drunk the day before :P

[16:03] <rafl> our $driver = Storable::dclone($Juerd);

[16:03] <Juerd> Because with moody passengers, it's harder even to stay focussed

[16:04] <rafl> Hm... is it enough if one of is doesn't get drunk? ;-)

[16:04] <Juerd> webmind: Okay, here's the plan - you get your eyes cut halfway March, and your driving scrap in a few weeks from now, and you will join the geektour. How does that sound? ;)

[16:05] <webmind> Juerd, can't

[16:05] <Juerd> Darn

[16:05] <webmind> I actually suspended my lessons until after the operation

[16:06] <Juerd> Oh

[16:06] <Juerd> Then, get your eyes cut next week, take up the lessons, get your license the first week of Feb, and join :)

[16:06] <webmind> the current condition of my eyes wasn't really helping

[16:07] <webmind> and that's being very positive about and our medical health care system and the burocracy of the cbr (have to get medical testing now from them)

[16:07] <Juerd> How much will you be affected by the operation, by the way?

[16:07] <rafl> Juerd: OK, I think I can promise not to get drunk, even if it's hard as there will be free drinks for me..

[16:07] <webmind> I will probably able to use both my eyes at the same time on a regular basis

[16:07] <Juerd> webmind: I meant more: hoe ingrijpend is het?

[16:08] <Juerd> Dunno how to express ingrijpend in English :)

[16:08] <webmind> I think I'll be able to see quite directly

[16:08] <webmind> they'll be replacing to muscles

[16:08] <webmind> but I'll be under a heavy narcoses

[16:08] <Juerd> Won't your brain need time to adjust?

[16:08] <webmind> and maybe I need to get used to the moving them around.. dunno yet

[16:08] <Juerd> For the eye coordination...

[16:08] <webmind> yeah

[16:08] <webmind> maybe

[16:10] <webmind> I'll ask this when I get the chance

[16:10] <webmind> probably this week

[16:10] <webmind> got some more questions anyway

[16:10] <Juerd> Why wasn't this done before, by the way?

[16:10] <Juerd> Didn't plan on driving? ;)

[16:10] <webmind> only recently looked into it

[16:11] <webmind> that too

[16:11] <webmind> but my timing with this is horribly

[16:11] <Juerd> Timing is always horrible when something is needed 

[16:13] <webmind> well I probably could get my licensen with my curretent eye coordination

[16:13] <webmind> but I notice I'm mainly cheating

[16:13] <webmind> which results in unsafe driving

[16:13] <webmind> don't like that

[16:16] <webmind> ofcourse if they pierce my eye while stiching the muscle back I won't be able to drive at all.. but ey :)

[16:21] <Alias_> As long as I'm not playing a sport for which glasses is a problem, I'm relatively happy

[16:22] <Alias_> I still get a bit icky about the loss of field of vision though

[16:22] <Alias_> every now and then I take off my glasses and remember what it was like to have a full 160 degrees

[16:22] <Alias_> well, 140-160

[16:23] <Alias_> It adds a certainly connection to reality...

[16:23] <Alias_> Putting the glasses back on feels like it adds a hint of depersonalisation

[16:23] <Alias_> Anyways...

[16:26] <Juerd> rafl: The entire tour, beginning and ending in Dordrecht, NL, is approx 2000 km, and that'll cost only around 150 euros in LPG :)

[16:27] <Juerd> rafl: Including car costs, this brings the trip costs up to approx 200

[16:27] <Juerd> rafl: Divided by 4 (hoping on 3 passengers total), that gets us around for 50 euros each :)

[16:28] <Juerd> rafl: That's dirt cheap...

[16:28] <Juerd> Try that by train ;)

[16:28] <Juerd> Though for you it'll be more expensive because you have to go to .be by train and to .de by train

[16:30] <Juerd> rafl: Do you know what good options there are for sleeping in Bochum?

[16:42] <Alias_> Juerd: That seems unusually cheap

[16:42] <Alias_> Does that factor in maintenance/devaulation etc?

[16:43] <Alias_> Generally car costs are around 20-40euro'cents per K

[16:43] *** bsb left
[16:45] <Juerd> Alias_: It factors in maintenance, not devaluation.

[16:45] <Juerd> Actual costs for my car are 21 cent per km.

[16:45] <Juerd> Provided Dutch LPG. German LPG is more expensive, for example

[20:12] <Juerd> Anyone interested in Mastering Regular Expressions, 1st edition?

[20:14] <Alias_> sigh

[20:14] <Juerd> ?

[20:15] * Alias_ tries to think of how prove is different to make test

[20:15] <Alias_> I have some test scripts that WORK with prove but FAIL in make test

[20:15] <Juerd> Environment?

[20:15] <Alias_> Just one very specific case, most of the rest of it all works still

[20:15] *** lypanov left
[20:15] <Alias_> And don't see how... I'm literally running them one after the other

[20:16] <Juerd> Is it Perl?

[20:16] <Alias_> what?

[20:16] <Alias_> Yes

[20:16] <Juerd> make test may be including blib/lib, while prove may not.

[20:16] <Alias_> prove -br

[20:17] <Alias_> So prove is using blib/lib too

[20:17] <Juerd> Still, though, dump \%ENV and compare :)

[20:18] <Alias_> point... doing so

[20:24] *** Medvekoma joined
[20:34] <Alias_> hmm... how interesting

[20:34] <Alias_> Juerd++ # Dunno if it will help, but it might be a start

[20:36] <Alias_> aha!

[20:36] <Alias_> Juerd++

[20:36] <Alias_> what an esoteric bug

[20:37] <Juerd> Yay, karma :)

[20:37] <jabbot> Juerd: :) has neutral karma

[20:37] <Juerd> :)++

[20:37] <Alias_> heh

[20:37] <Juerd> Yay, karma :)

[20:37] <jabbot> Juerd: :) has neutral karma

[20:37] <Alias_> prove sets up the included directories differently to make test

[20:37] <Juerd> jabbot++  # You're useless, but I like you anyway.

[20:38] <Alias_> prove's ones don't forvive run3'ing

[20:38] <Alias_> s/forvive/survive

[20:38] <theorbtwo> That's probably a bug.

[20:38] <Alias_> I'm in RT as we speak

[20:39] <Alias_> wow it has a lot of bugs

[20:40] <Alias_> and spam apparently

[20:40] <Juerd> Of course.

[20:40] <Juerd> Doesn't everything that is big have lots of bugs?

[20:41] <Alias_> no

[20:41] <Juerd> The more code, the more chance for error.

[20:41] <Alias_> Assuming constantly bad code

[20:41] <Juerd> Not really.

[20:41] * Alias_ has about 20 bugs for 107 distributions

[20:41] <Alias_> 15 of those are small PPI things I haven't gotten around to

[20:42] <Juerd> But are those 107 distributions used as much as RT?

[20:42] <Alias_> Test::Harness has more bugs than my total number

[20:42] <rafl> Juerd: 50 EUR sound reasonable.

[20:42] <rafl> Juerd: I think I can organize something in Bochum.

[20:42] <Juerd> rafl: Does that equate to 'free'? :)

[20:43] <Juerd> rafl: BTW, in .nl, I think we can sleep in my office

[20:43] <Juerd> rafl: It's showerless (as it's an office building), but I think we can survive that.

[20:43] <rafl> Juerd: I also think so.

[20:44] <Juerd> It's a 1 hr drive from my office to Amsterdam

[20:44] <Juerd> Something I do every month anyway :)

[20:44] <Juerd> And recently, several times per week.

[20:44] <Juerd> I can show you feather if you want ;)

[20:44] <Juerd> Though it's not interesting if you've been in a datacentre before

[20:46] <rafl> Juerd: I work in a super computing centre..

[20:46] <Juerd> Then it'd be uttely boring :)

[20:46] <Juerd> Google for "aopen h360" and you know what feather looks like :P

[20:47] <Juerd> http://aopen.jp/products/housing/images/h360-300.jpg  # like that

[20:47] <Juerd> Hm, no, wrong model

[20:47] <Alias_> hmm

[20:47] <Alias_> Actually, I'm not sure if make test's behaviour is correct either

[20:47] <Juerd> http://www.i-tech.com.au/images/products/AO89001_hg.jpg  # like that

[20:50] <Alias_> aaaah

[20:50] <Alias_> Now I see...

[20:50] <Alias_> Because prove doesn't set PERL5LIB, it was run3'ing something that launched with the older version of the code, that didn't have the bug

[20:54] <Juerd> It must have been a path issue.

[20:54] <Alias_> What was hiding it was that the old and new code was so similar

[20:54] <Alias_> 3 lines different, which resulting in a subtle change not fully covered in the tests that SHOULD have double checks that behaviour

[20:55] <Alias_> 3 element failure

[20:55] <Alias_> Actually, 4 element

[20:55] <Alias_> old and new code + prove behaviour + run3 + bad coverage
