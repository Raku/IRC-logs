[03:46] <Alias_> seen audreyt?

[03:47] * pfenwick waves to Alias.

[03:48] * Alias_ waves back

[03:48] <Alias_> Let me work out how much I owe you

[03:49] <Alias_> sigh, overloady day

[03:49] <Alias_> Everything blows up at once

[03:49] <pfenwick> Alias: Feel free to take your time and do things by e-mail.  There's no rush.

[03:49] <Alias_> sure

[03:49] <Alias_> Just wanted to do it before the end of the financial year, so I don't have to pay tax on it

[03:50] <Alias_> Although that's probably not a large problem

[03:50] * pfenwick laughs!

[03:50] <Alias_> Well, you'll do quite well out of this job once it's over

[03:51] <Alias_> Just not necesarily in this first invoice

[05:26] <Alias_> Can you DOS the bot? :)

[05:31] <unobe> not that daring :)

[05:32] <Alias_> ditto

[05:32] <Alias_> I figure it's either trivial or impossible

[05:33] <unobe> i'm trying to figure out why some of the smoke tests are failing for my build.

[05:34] <unobe> the above evaluations just makes pugs segfault

[05:34] <unobe> i haven't updated parrot in a bit, so i'm going to try that

[07:58] <Alias_> What about it you also increment a variable in the loop :)

[07:58] <Alias_> Such as the perl 5 C< while ( 1 ) { $_++ } > one

[07:58] <gaal> go ahead

[07:58] <Alias_> ok, later

[07:58] <Alias_> Too busy right now, shouldn't even be talking

[07:58] <gaal> no worries, that's covered.
