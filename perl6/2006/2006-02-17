[05:23] <sili_> is there anything like jni for parrot?

[05:24] <obra> manybe parrot nci?

[05:35] <Khisanth> is there going to be a better replacement for CPAN and CPANPLUS? :(

[05:44] <obra> Khisanth: talk to kane.

[05:44] <obra> he's been working on cpan for 6

[05:45] <Khisanth> YEARS?!

[05:46] <obra> ....perl6

[05:46] <Khisanth> this "installation successful but oops I didn't actually copy the module's files" is getting rather annoying after the 10th time

[07:44] <Alias_> You can never find a bot when you need one

[07:53] <Khisanth> @seen audreyt

[07:53] <Khisanth> heh it would be nice if there was some sort of standard for irc bot interfaces :P

[07:53] <Alias_> botname, command

[07:54] <Alias_> But it would be nice if you could make some specific commands implicit

[07:54] <Alias_> Rather than all or nothing implicit/explicit

[09:46] <GeJ> slightly off-topic, but if a kind soul with too much free time in his hands could have a look at this, that would be *really* appreciated : http://sial.org/pbot/15899

[09:54] <xinming> GeJ: Could you ask on #perl? As I don't people here could answer the question other than perl 6 & pugs. (as most people would be more familiar with compiling pugs)

[09:54] <xinming> s/I\sdon't/I don't think/

[09:55] <GeJ> Already did that, but as the summarizer often says "Warnock applies"

[09:56] <GeJ> hence my desperate attempt to ask the-best-of-the-best-of-the-best of the perl community.

[09:56] <GeJ> ;)

[09:56] <xinming> GeJ: Why not use 5.8.7? :-)

[09:57] <xinming> GeJ: Or you are a porter of FreeBsd?

[09:58] <GeJ> well, if it's broken it needs to be fixed. So I would like to know if my 5.8.8 is borked so I can try to fix it and share the fix with other people. Isn't it one of the benefits of OSS?

[09:59] <GeJ> I'm not the maintainer of the port, but I'm testing a possible upgrade to 5.8.8. everything is pretty nice, except this little annoyance

[10:01] <xinming> GeJ: I think you can look into the module source

[10:02] <GeJ> did that too already. Made like a gazillions of print LOGFILE "..." to compare the behavior on both platforms

[10:03] <GeJ> everything similar (except for some $path =~ s/5.8.7/5.8.8/)

[10:04] <GeJ> well, a melenux user ca reproduce the warnings on a perl 5.8.8

[10:05] <GeJ> that's what I wanted to know... just wanted to be sure that I'm not the only one suffering this behavior

[23:56] <azuroth> is there a shorthand for "{temp $_ = $object; ...}" ?
