[04:40] <chessguy> is there library-level access to pugs? i.e., is there a haskell module i can include to do "foo = eval(somePerlCode)" ?

[07:24] <gaal> @tell chessguy in principle, yes: Pugs is cabalized so that should be possible. You do need to do some setup, ie load an empty environment and install magicals. IIRC your best place to start looking would be Pugs.Run, then follow it back up to whatever processes the command line.

[22:57] <gaal> miyagawa: pong

[22:57] <gaal> I was just about to go to bed

[22:57] <gaal> But I fixed the bug, thanks! :-)

[22:58] <nwc10> the JSON::Syck bug he was asking about on #london.pm and put in RT? or something else?

[22:59] <miyagawa> that's the Best.pm bug

[22:59] <miyagawa> gaal: thanks

[22:59] <nwc10> ah. So many bugs. :-(

[22:59] <nwc10> but one less now :-)

[23:00] <gaal> nwc10: I like your Preservation of 16 effort

[23:00] <gaal> though 17's not too bad, it's prime

[23:01] <nwc10> it doesn't have the same ring

[23:01] <gaal> I know a great book with a character called Preserved in it

[23:01] <nwc10> Larry seemed to agree that 16 was nicer

[23:01] <gaal> 17 is also known as the "least random number"

[23:01] <nwc10> why so?

[23:02] <nwc10> "seemed" because I remember that he made a comment, but I forget exactly what it was

[23:02] <nwc10> now all you have to do is send search parties out to the hotsprings to get clkao back to write something. :-)

[23:02] <gaal> I don't know, around these parts at least when somebody reifies $RANDOM_NUMBER it often turns out to be 17. more often than you'd expect

[23:03] <nwc10> :-)

[23:04] <gaal> when was the Best bug (hm, isn't that a chain?) discovered?

[23:05] <gaal> actually I'd better go to sleep. (now that the best bugs won't bite etc.)

[23:05] <gaal> z&

[23:06] <TreyHarris> gaal: "most random number".  a psychological study at MIT showed that when asked to select a random number between M and N where M <= 17 and N >= 17, 17 is the choice more often than any other number

[23:07] <TreyHarris> it seems really random to people for some reason :)

[23:09] <gaal> { in hebrew, the first syllable of "17" rhymes with "blah" ; resleep }

[23:19] <diotalevi> Best has a bug? It's not mentioned on rt.cpan.org.

[23:21] <nwc10> had, I believe. "22:57 < gaal> But I fixed the bug, thanks! :-)"
