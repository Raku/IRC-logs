[01:22] <mdmkolbe|work> Is this the right channel to ask questions about building Pugs?

[01:23] <wolverian> yup

[01:24] *** kanru joined
[01:26] <mdmkolbe|work> ok, so I'm trying to build pugs on a Linux machine where I don't have admin privledges (a school machine). GHC 6.6 was already installed by the admins, but when I configure pugs it gives a message "ghc-6.6: unknown package: mtl\n*** Could not load the "mtl" package in your GHC installation.".  And then some instructions about recompiling ghc. Is there a way to fix that without recompiling GHC or needed admin privledges?

[01:27] <wolverian> I think you need the extralibs compiled. you can compile them locally. I haven't done it myself, though.

[01:30] <wolverian> you might have more luck on #haskell 

[01:30] <mdmkolbe|work> good idea

[01:30] <wolverian> (especially as people seem to be sleeping here :)

[01:56] <mdmkolbe|work> to build pugs is it just "./configure; make"? or do I need something else first? (I'm now getting the error "Setup: error reading ./.setup-config; run "setup configure" command?" and running "./Setup configure" doesn't help)

[02:02] <Tene> perl Makefile.pl

[02:03] <Tene> make

[02:07] <mdmkolbe|work> It looks like I needed to install the haskell network package.

[02:45] <mdmkolbe|work> yea!, pugs built

[02:48] <Tene> yay!
