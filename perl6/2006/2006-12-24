[01:50] <TimToady> honestly, I think I could redefine the whole language over Christmas and no one would notice.  :)

[01:55] <Tene> TimToady: howso?

[01:57] <TimToady> 'cuz it seems like no one is reading p6l right now.  :)

[01:58] <TimToady> I guess Perl people have too many families, or somethin'

[01:59] <araujo> haha

[02:01] <TimToady> I've been trying to remember who was carping about the smartmatching tables not being consistent in the synopses, and can't.  I hope they like the new version better.

[02:02] * araujo bets if TimToady makes a release announcement 'half' of the world will be talking about perl6

[02:03] <dduncan> regarding the 'cat' operator ... AFAIK, it is meant to evoke the Unix 'cat' utility, but I think that for a lot of people that name is ambiguously confusing ... I suggest an alternative name, perhaps 'concat', instead

[02:04] <dduncan> for one thing, I usually find abbreviated names easier to understand if they involve the start of the word or phrase they are summarizing

[02:04] <TimToady> I think there is little chance of people confusing the operator with a feline.

[02:04] <araujo> haha

[02:05] <dduncan> how many other operators don't resemble the start of the word they are summarizing?

[02:05] <TimToady> there are people who use the word "catenate"

[02:06] <TimToady> con is just "with" noise from Latin

[02:06] <dduncan> so catenate is the actual base word?

[02:06] <TimToady> you'd have to ask a Roman

[02:07] <TimToady> anyway, nobody who's ever had anything to do with Unix would be confused.

[02:08] <araujo> very similar to spanish

[02:08] <TimToady> dinner is calling; I got me one of them thar families too, seems. &

[02:08] <araujo> 'concatenar' == 'con' == 'with'

[02:08] <dduncan> fyi, 'cat' means 'catalog' to me

[02:08] <araujo> catenar being the base word

[02:10] *** ozo_ joined
[02:18] <dduncan> I see 'cat' evoking 'categorize' or 'catalog' or other words in a lot of people before 'concatenate' ... which is why I brought this subject up ... I know there would be no confusing with a feline

[02:20] <dduncan> but, whatever, people will learn whatever it is chosen to mean

[05:51] <beppu{home}> What do you think he meant when he said that the Perl community was "Inward Looking"?

[05:51] <beppu{home}> FYI, It's about 42 minutes into the talk.

[07:00] <cognominal> it has a strong identity that is slow to share :)

[07:02] <cognominal> btw, criticizing Perl by putting up to par with gcc is not so much a critic btw.

[07:04] <cognominal> He says that today economy is strengthened by communauties and that Perl is not strong at that but all his talks is about free software building communauties...

[07:04] <cognominal> beats me.

[07:20] <gaal> you could call it conc and confuse everyone who ever knew lisp, as well as everyone who never did

[07:22] <dduncan> mind you, 'cat' is better than 'con'

[07:22] <dduncan> or 'oncat'

[07:26] <gaal> I don't know whnce this discordian mood, but you could also call it tack, confusing unix folks who might be thinkicn of tac(1).

[12:26] <masak> re the ":= cat" syntax, why not use ":= tie" or something? right now it seems the comment has to explain that ":= cat" ties the scalar to the filehandle

[12:26] <masak> whereas if it said "my $stream := tie $fh;", it would be obvious

[12:27] <masak> just my €0.02, i haven't really looked deeply into the issue

[12:27] <ayrnieu> what currency of cents are those?

[12:28] <gaal> euro

[12:29] <gaal> just to make sure: @lines := =fh is already lazy w/o modifications, right?

[12:30] <gaal> because I thought we encountered problems with close-before-read precisely on filehandles

[12:30] <gaal> and audreyt changed =$fh to be strict in response.

[12:31] <gaal> so I'm not saying anything about the cat/tie/whatever language feature, except that the example in the docs may not be a good one.
