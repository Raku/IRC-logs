[13:40] <gaal> interesting. eval_yaml is triggering a stack overflow, but not in itself

[13:40] <gaal> my $x = Pugs::Internals::emit_yaml("42") doesn't crash

[13:40] <gaal> but then say $x does

[13:41] <gaal> $x.chars gives 1384459

[13:41] <gaal> (which is too much; it means that the globby data isn't being filtered out)

[13:41] <gaal> this indicates that printing very long strings is broken.

[13:48] <Limbic_Region> testing

[13:49] <Limbic_Region> ok good

[16:13] <gaal> ghcbug?

[16:14] <gnuvince> gaal: is x implemented with recursion?

[16:14] <gaal> gnuvince: no, you can allocate this string seperately. it's the say that triggers the overflow:

[16:14] <gaal> ?eval my $x = "a" x (2**20); say $x

[16:14] <gaal> ?eval my $x = "a" x (2**20); say $x.chars

[16:15] <evalbot_r14875> OUTPUT[] Error: stack overflow

[16:15] <gaal> ?eval my $x = "a" x (2**20); say $x.chars

[16:15] <evalbot_r14875> OUTPUT[1048576␤] Bool::True

[16:15] <evalbot_r14875> OUTPUT[1048576␤] Bool::True

[16:15] <gaal> heh.

[16:15] <gaal> not very fast is it

[16:16] <gaal> but anyway: the problem is in printing long strings

[16:16] <gnuvince> hmm

[16:16] <Limbic_Region> ?eval print "a" x (2 ** 20)

[16:17] <evalbot_r14875> OUTPUT[] Error: stack overflow

[16:17] <gaal> > replicate 1048576 'a' -- would work, probably.

[16:17] <lambdabot>  "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

[16:17] <Limbic_Region> gaal - I no longer have pugs to test this but is it perhaps an evalbot thing so it doesn't flood the channel?

[16:17] <gaal> because we can't do IO in \bot

[16:17] <gaal> Limbic_Region: no.

[16:18] <gaal> Limbic_Region: unfortunately, it's a pugs thing,

[16:18] <gaal> printing any long string.

[16:18] <Limbic_Region> gaal - and it affects all print thingies - print, say, printf

[16:19] <gaal> though: prelude.yml is generated fine and is longer than 1mb, so i'm thinking there's a oldstring conversion somewhere that must be triggering this

[16:19] <gaal> and that which dumping as yaml directly prolly doesn't go though

[16:19] <Limbic_Region> grrr - the combination of IE, CGI:IRC, and my connection to feather is making this nearly impossible
