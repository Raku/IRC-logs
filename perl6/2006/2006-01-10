[05:51] <gaal> There are two open issues I won't have a chance to work on in the next ~12 hours:

[05:51] <gaal> 1. continue r8630 and fix exportation of multi subs

[05:52] <gaal> 2. Rule yaml deserialization: find why they're tripping a segfault when applied

[05:53] <gaal> 3. (BEGIN { s/two/three/ above }) workaround "use_ok" in test suite

[11:31] <audreyt> xinming: no, I'm a woman now :) see http://pugs.blogs.com/audrey/2005/12/runtime_typecas.html

[11:37] <xinming> audreyt: Oh, Ok, hmm, I would use she for you in the future. :-)

[11:37] <audreyt> thanks!

[11:38] <nothingmuch> =)

[11:38] <nothingmuch> this is almost quoteworthy

[11:38] <Odin-> 'almost'?

[11:38] <nothingmuch> i like the way the community is so non-bigotty

[11:38] <nothingmuch> people just accept things

[11:38] <nothingmuch> realizing it doesn't really make a difference

[11:39] <audreyt> *nod*

[11:42] <xinming> hmm, The truth is, Everything is reasonable, And we just need to accept it after we know the reason. :-)

[11:43] <Grrrr> audreyt  \o/

[11:45] <nothingmuch> xinming: my grudge, and possibly the reason why i broke up any romantic relationships i've had up to now, is exactly people's inability to do just that

[11:45] <nothingmuch> (what I meant is - it was always a barrier for me)

[11:46] <nothingmuch> basically, when you are trying to get someone to accept/agree/learn/try something

[11:46] <nothingmuch> and they refuse to do so

[11:46] <nothingmuch> for a reason that is completely besides the point

[11:46] <nothingmuch> refusing to conquer dogma, or groundless fear

[11:46] <nothingmuch> it really really gets to me

[11:46] <nothingmuch> and this has been very uncommon here

[11:46] <nothingmuch> people genuwinely listen

[11:46] <GeJ> if I may, the only problem I have with this is that I used to advertise autrijus as "_Teh_ Man" around me while telling my friends about pugs and parrot... now I've got to change all the badges, flyers and such and work on a new campaign... 

[11:47] <GeJ> but I'm working on it

[11:47] <nothingmuch> and either they change your mind, or you change their mind, or you just maturely disagree

[11:47] <theorbtwo> GeJ: Or just consider "_Teh_ Man" a gender-neutral term.

[11:49] <theorbtwo> Should probably fix the WP article to actually mention not just both sets of names, but the reasoning.

[11:50] <theorbtwo> (On the theory that the genders of the names might not be obvious to people for whom neither chinese nor english are native languages, and that it's better to be obvious then indirect.)

[11:50] <xinming> nothingmuch: Things will change, Hmm, People here will also think this isn't right compare to tradition, But you can just throw it behind... It's the same as me. I was playing with computer all day. And I don't have a girl friend for now... The rumour from my neighbours are all saying that there is something wrong with me... 

[11:51] <nothingmuch> hehe

[11:51] <nothingmuch> i hope you're right

[11:51] <xinming> hmm, though, I know I am a boy. I don't care much about the rumour.

[11:51] * Odin-LAP suggests there most likely is ... but then again, there's something wrong with most everyone.

[11:52] <nothingmuch> the way things are headed with russia, the us, iran and all that, it seems that everyone is going the other way though

[11:52] <theorbtwo> I generally find it amuzing, rather then horrible, when people assume "theorbtwo" is a feminine nick.

[11:52] <Odin-LAP> And you rarely, if ever, manage to guess what it is. ;)

[11:52] * nothingmuch suspects the nicest places to live will be venezuela and bolivia in ~10-15 years, if they keep it up

[11:52] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: when I was bored i used to name myself 'Natural Blond - Naturally Dumb'

[11:53] <nothingmuch> people would bug me all the time

[11:53] <nothingmuch> not realizing i was kidding

[11:53] <nothingmuch> i would play along, and then call them icky or something when they made suggestive comments

[11:53] <xinming> No matter what they says, Just go with your own way, I don't hurt other people, and I just wish to play with computer...that's all, So for now, I am not as nervous as before... hmm, maybe I should say angry.

[11:53] <nothingmuch> it provided amusement in 5 minute slices

[11:53] <nothingmuch> but then again, i was ~14

[11:53] <nothingmuch> so i thought that stuff was much funnier

[11:53] <Odin-LAP> nothingmuch: Dunno. The 'Bolivarian revolution' is a different authoritarian slice than bolshevism, but I understand it's no picnic disagreeing with Chavez...

[11:54] <nothingmuch> Odin-LAP: i'll take your word for it

[11:54] <nothingmuch> i only vaguely heard about it

[11:55] <nothingmuch> but from what I've heard i'm at least optimistic

[11:55] * theorbtwo decides to skip it, on the theory that it'd involve writing large passages of sensical English.

[11:55] <theorbtwo> ...and that I've got enough damn projects already.

[11:56] * xinming is out for supper.

[11:56] <audreyt> miyagawa++ # pushing me to merge YAML::Syck codebase to JSON::Syck 

[11:56] <Odin-LAP> nothingmuch: I do think it's something to be optimistic about. The least it does is to show that neoliberal economics aren't the only reality. :p

[18:06] <clkao> of course it uses b::deparse

[22:32] <dduncan> or I'll wait a few months for the iBook successor having intel, which is cheaper

[22:32] * stevan agrees :)

[22:33] <stevan> dduncan: although with apple it is usually good to wait a few months after the first ones are out,.. just so they get the kinks out

[22:33] <dduncan> sure

[22:33] <dduncan> though I generally wanted to be among the early adopters ... first models ... barring something really awful

[22:43] <xah> huh?

[22:46] <dduncan> steven, I doubt there will be any lawsuits

[22:46] <dduncan> first of all, that's a very generic word

[22:46] <dduncan> second, I announced publically I would be using that name in jan/feb of 2003; Apple did it in june of 2005, so I was first

[22:47] <dduncan> I have no intention to sue them, and they have no right to sue me

[22:47] <dduncan> jan/feb 2003 is when I officially registered 'Rosetta' with the perl 5 module list, fyi

[22:48] <dduncan> in any event, while I have considered changing the name of my module, it won't be because of Apple, but because 'Rosetta' is very generic

[22:49] <dduncan> but if I do that, it won't be any time soon

[22:50] <stevan> dduncan: you should call it Cocoa to get back at Steve Jobs :P

[22:51] <dduncan> any new name has to be either descriptive of purpose, or unique to be branded

[22:51] <stevan> iDBI :P

[22:51] <dduncan> besides, Apple is only using "Rosetta" as an "under the hood" type name, like they used "Altivec"; they don't use it for any public brand

[22:52] <dduncan> actually, plain "DBI" is a good name, but Tim Bunce is already using it

[22:52] <dduncan> oh, I just put up a new smoke, following my file rearrangements

[22:53] <dduncan> r8580, Normal runcore, darwin

[22:55] <dduncan> all the tests of my components in ext cleanly pass

[22:55] <stevan> dduncan: do  you know if the intel version of OS X runs on vanilla Intel machine?

[22:55] <dduncan> yes and no

[22:56] <stevan> explain please 

[22:56] <dduncan> some enterprising third parties have gotten X 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 to work on vanilla intel, but it's not a trivially easy task

[22:57] <dduncan> Apple has built Mac OS X to check for certain hardware signitures that would be in its own hardware, and refuse to run if not there ...

[22:57] <dduncan> or just refuse to install

[22:57] <stevan> yeah I would expect something like that

[22:57] <dduncan> Apple's official policy is that Mac OS X is for their own hardware only

[22:57] <stevan> after all Apple is a hardware company first

[22:58] <dduncan> doubtless, third parties will get it to work on other hardware, but Apple just wants to make this difficult enough that few people will actually do it

[22:58] <dduncan> on the other side of the coin, Apple has no problems with people running other operating systems, Windows et al, on their Mac hardware, but they also will provide no support for this

[22:59] <dduncan> and some sites I read said that vanilla Windows did run on their Intel Mac test boxen

[22:59] <dduncan> as for Linux, well it already runs on everything

[23:26] <xinming> But the problem is, If the signature is a Bios-like thing, or, It is in fact stored in Bios. then, I believe people can break this protection in at most half a year. :-)

[23:26] <xinming> hmm, I don't mean patch the OS.

[23:27] <xinming> Windows Xp is a good example.

[23:30] <SamB> windows XP is supposed to run on everything

[23:31] <xinming> hmm, Yes, I mean for the OEM version of Windows Xp, Some people download the oem version of windows, and change a signature in Bios to install the OEM version.
