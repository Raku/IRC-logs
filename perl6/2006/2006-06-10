[02:06] <stevan> audreyt: I just uploaded Moose::Autobox to CPAN

[02:06] <stevan> audreyt: it makes heavy use of roles to create the 4 basic Perl 5 "types" (Scalar, Array, Hash & Code)

[02:07] <stevan> it's very rough still, but it's fun to play with :)

[02:28] <obra> seen audreyt

[02:55] * QtPlatypus hasn't seen audreyt today.

[17:58] *** putter joined
[17:59] <putter> any parsey around?  i'm puzzling over blocks...

[17:59] <putter> err, s/any/anyone/

[17:59] <putter> issue is...

[18:04] *** Aankh|Clone is now known as Aankhen``

[18:04] <putter> oh, fribble.  I get it.

[18:13] <putter> ok, thinking aloud...

[18:14] <putter> blocks... a block gets parsed, and if in retrospect it can be interpreted as hash literal, it is.  a bit bizarre, but nicely local.

[18:15] *** nperez joined
[18:16] <putter> the trailing }... to get map:{3;}.foo to be (map:{3;}).foo, while f {3;},42; still works normally, the {block} term is unusual.

[18:17] <Alias_> rindolf: I'm here, but can't private message

[18:20] <putter> one can deal with it in several ways.  the '}' lexeme can establish a mutant post-term parser context which only accepts a few specially labeled ops ( , : => ).  so hitting .foo creates a parse-fail/end-of-stream for the argument list expr.

[18:21] *** b_jonas joined
[18:23] <putter> or, if all the special ops nest, err, left, so the argument list can be wrapped up in a single parser reduce step, one can use a collaborative precedence.  i think.  maybe.  but it seems an unfortunate restriction.

[18:25] <putter> the gotcha with adding a mutant post-term state, is it doesnt deal with this:

[18:30] <putter> f:{3;}.foo is (f:{3;}).foo, but simple  {3;}.foo  is just fine.  I don't immediately know which way 2,'a',{3;}.foo,13 is supposed to go, but eh.  the problem is, it looks like {3;} has to be treated differently in the two cases.  ie, the parser has _non-local_ state, "I am/am-not parsing a (argument?) list".  which seems to

[18:30] <putter> reach down into core shift/reduce decisions.

[18:31] <putter> so... what am I missing?  is there a clean way to do this?

[18:38] *** DaGo joined
[18:40] <putter> I (very) fuzzily _think_ you can do it as a after-the-parse rewrite step.  maybe.  but blech.

[18:46] <putter> I bit of state (literally;) in the parser would be fine.  I just didn't expect it.  Hopefully I'm confused.
