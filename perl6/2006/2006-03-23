[01:04] <arcady> getting it to support double quotes is probably non-trivial though

[01:04] <arcady> since you have to do interpolation and so on

[01:06] <avar> and "{1+1}"

[01:08] <arcady> and just unescaping takes some effort

[01:59] <avar> arcady: I was just wondering what it does support ATM;)

[02:11] <arcady> barely enough to compile itself, I think

[02:11] <arcady> and that only partly

[02:20] <arcady> though technically only two files of perl 5 left: Grammar/Perl6Init.pm and Emitter/Perl5.pm

[10:04] <Gothmog_> spo0nman: It seems that libparrot.so.0.4.2 is not existent, or not to be where it should be. What about "find -name libparrot.so\*"?

[10:09] <spo0nman> Gothmog_: let me try.

[10:09] *** fandango joined
[10:14] <spo0nman> Gothmog_: it lists /usr/local/lib/libparrot.so

[10:14] <spo0nman> /usr/local/lib/libparrot.so.0.4.2

[10:16] <spo0nman> hmm, I have declare -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/share/kde-unstable/lib:"

[10:16] <spo0nman> from when i was doing kde dev ... i wonder if this is messing things up.

[10:20] <KingDiamond> spo0nman: do a copy like you did the other day on your FBSD box

[10:20] <spo0nman> KingDiamond: what copy?

[10:21] <spo0nman> KingDiamond: No, thats not the problem ... Strace shows that its looking for libs in some .kde directory. i got it

[10:23] <Gothmog_> Next time you should just append the path, I suppose. :-)

[10:29] *** drrho joined
[10:38] <spo0nman> Gothmog_: Im still not able to get pugs to work on BSD ... want to take a shot at that?

[10:42] <spo0nman> http://pastebin.com/617748

[10:42] <spo0nman> this is the output of the strace on parrot.

[10:42] <spo0nman> X-(

[10:52] <Gothmog_> I'm not sure if /usr/local/lib is searched by default, without requiring you to put it in an environment variable like LD_LIBRARY_PATH... or you can try playing a symlink to the lib in a place which is searched.

[10:53] <Gothmog_> s/playing/placing/

[10:54] <Gothmog_> Like /usr/lib, e.g.

[10:56] <spo0nman> /lib/tls/i686/sse2/cmov/libparrot.so.0.4.2 <------ whats this?

[10:56] <Gothmog_> In the output of strace?

[10:57] <spo0nman> yes.

[10:57] <Gothmog_> I think pugs is just trying to open libparrot.so.0.4.2 in every place it can think of.

[11:09] <spo0nman> hmm

[11:11] <nothingmuch> Gothmog_: that's dlopen

[11:11] <nothingmuch> therre's the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable

[11:11] <nothingmuch> and the hard coded libs

[11:11] <nothingmuch> and /etc/ld.cache or whatever

[11:11] <nothingmuch> and all of them can affect the order in which paths are tried

[11:11] <nothingmuch> so it's not pugs per se, it's the dynamic linking stuff

[11:11] <nothingmuch> but yes, that's basically it: pugs is trying to open libparrot.so.0.4.2 in every place it can think of =)

[11:12] <nothingmuch> spo0nman: hope that helps

[11:12] <nothingmuch> normally pugs's Makefile.PL is supposed to find parrot's lib based on what parrot tells it about it

[11:12] <nothingmuch> maybe #parrot on irc.perl.org can help with this

[11:13] <spo0nman> nothingmuch: hmm.

[12:37] <ruoso> fglock, pong

[12:38] <ingy> audreyt: elk

[12:40] <fglock> ruoso: about the shift/unshift operations - these are internal operations that implement syntactic categories (see the macro implementation) - they should not be needed in the final version of the grammar

[12:41] <fglock> I'll start implementing the operator precedence parser today (if I have time)

[12:41] <ruoso> but... <@terms> is a valid syntax

[12:41] <ruoso> and @terms must be an array of rule

[12:41] <ruoso> s

[12:42] <ruoso> why are they internal operations?

[12:42] <fglock> ruoso: if you define 'sub terms:<op> {...}' then 'op' will be 'pushed' into @terms

[12:43] <rgs> hi ingy

[12:43] <fglock> not actually pushed, because there is the precedence

[12:44] <ruoso> fglock, but isn't it valid to create an array of rules at runtime and use it in a match like <@terms>?

[12:46] <fglock> ruoso: yes - but the syntactic category sugar has other advantages - for example, the effect is lexical

[12:46] <fglock> (afaik)

[12:47] <fglock> ruoso: and you can define precedence - precedence in @terms is more difficult to handle

[12:48] <ruoso> fglock, the order of the pushes, or the order of the sub declarations... isn't it?

[12:49] <ruoso> fglock, btw, did you mean 'rule terms:<op> {...}'?

[12:50] <fglock> ruoso: look for 'is tighter' in S06

[12:51] <fglock> ruoso: 'sub terms:<op> {...}' is an implementation that adds itself to the parser - it uses a default rule

[12:55] <fglock> ruoso: 'macro/is parsed' in lrep - without 'is parsed'

[13:37] <Dazhbog> well I can't say, I have never tried

[13:38] <Juerd> I think you can do it

[13:52] <ruoso> fglock, Hmmm... I think there is something wrong with the magic-return

[13:53] <ruoso> fglock, the concat rule is not making an array with the capture from each subrule

[13:53] <ruoso> fglock, if I have <rule1><rule2><rule3>

[13:54] <ruoso> fglock, rule1 and rule3 are simple matches

[13:54] <ruoso> fglock, rule2 returns a hashref

[13:54] <ruoso> fglock,  should the capture be ['matchedbyrule1',{a=>1},'matchedbyrule2']?

[13:56] <ruoso> fglock, or I am completely confused

[14:04] <ingy> hi rgs, what's up

[14:05] <rgs> ingy: I just wanted to mention the amusing fact that rpm has native yaml support since last week

[14:05] <ingy> sign of end times

[14:05] <ingy> surely

[14:05] <rgs> surely. I repent

[14:05] <rgs> (not my idea, though :)

[14:06] <fglock> ruoso: looking

[14:08] <ruoso> fglock, I'm not sure it's the concat rule... it's a guess

[14:09] <fglock> ruoso: if you have <rule1><rule2><rule3>, then you get the result in %$match - the capture is a string

[14:10] <ruoso> but %$match will have only the named captures, right?

[14:16] <ruoso> fglock, I'm confused

[14:17] * ruoso is almost understanding

[14:18] <fglock> ruoso: yes, and @$match will have the unnamed captures - but captures that are quantified generate an array ref

[14:18] <fglock> so a quantified named capture generates @{ $match{name} }

[14:19] <fglock> but this is not implemented yet

[14:19] <ruoso> oops

[14:20] <ruoso> fglock, I think it's mandatory to lrep...

[14:20] <fglock> it can be done with a few extra lines in Match.pm - but I can't do this right now ($work)

[14:21] <ruoso> fglock, ok... I'll take a look and see if I can do it...

[14:24] <fglock> ruoso: see S05 for details

[14:24] <ruoso> fglock, so for quantified named captures... at this moment it is returning the match object... the correct will be to return a arrayref

[14:25] <ruoso> fglock, exactly...
