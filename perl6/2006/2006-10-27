[00:07] <dduncan> regarding my CPANPLUS comment, I ended up filing an RT item: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22627

[00:16] <avar> wrt p6doc, is there any documentation similar to perldoc -f *?

[00:43] <svnbot6> r14536 | avar++ | * State more clearly that chomp removes one newline

[00:50] <eviltwin_b> huh.  and hs-plugins is also known broken, I see.  (worth reinstalling 6.4 to make it work?)

[00:56] *** vel joined
[00:57] *** hikozaemon joined
[00:59] <dduncan> or install 6.6 if you're on a supported platform

[01:01] *** nperez joined
[01:01] <Tene> yay, pugs is much faster on 6.6

[01:02] <Debolaz> Would the appropriate way to read a yaml configuration file be slurp($filename).eval(:lang<yaml>); ?

[01:04] <eviltwin_b> there's also evalfile

[01:04] <eviltwin_b> hrm, wonder if my perl is still hosed.  Task::Smoke dependencies threw lots of odd warnings

[01:04] <eviltwin_b> s/perl/&5/

[01:05] <eviltwin_b> (or s:P5 if it makes you happier... :)

[01:12] *** ferreira left
[01:14] <avar> garg, either I'm blind or the POD tools that come with Perl 5 are totally useless for my purposes

[01:15] <avar> I was going to implement p6doc -f with Pod::Select by say reading =item * log10 from S29 but it only supports getting level one headings

[01:16] * avar just uses Pod::Parser

[01:37] *** penk joined
[01:57] <avar> I've found a way to retrive a section in S29 using Pod::Parser but it's a bit terse, subclass che command, verbatim and textblock subs and keep track of line numbers

[01:57] <avar> e.g.:

[01:57] <avar> 997: chomp

[01:57] <avar> 999:  our Str multi method chomp ( Str $string: ) is export

[01:57] <avar> 1001: Returns string with one newline removed from the end.

[02:01] <avar> any better suggestions?:)

[19:53] *** robkinyon joined
[19:53] <johannes_> maybe someone has time to help me out then ;)

[19:55] <TimToady> johannes_: do you have a src/Pugs directory?

[19:55] <Debolaz> Has anybody drawn up a comparison between perl 6, ruby, python, etc? Ie, features that are perceived as strengths that the other languages don't have or at least are more obscure.

[19:56] <johannes_> yes,

[19:56] <johannes_> its a fresh checkout from svn

[19:59] <TimToady> that's a very strange error to get then.  if it were failing to create the file for any other reason, it shouldn't complain about a missing file or directory

[19:59] <johannes_> i'll record the whole configure && make output

[20:00] <TimToady> the only other way I can think to get the error would be if there were a symbolic link pointing to somewhere nonexistent.

[20:00] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - were you aware of the rosettastone.org project?

[20:01] * Limbic_Region checks the case of that path

[20:01] *** larsen_ joined
[20:01] <TimToady> never heard of it.

[20:02] <Limbic_Region> supposedly the largest collection of linguist data around

[20:02] <Limbic_Region> I can't get the site to come up though

[20:02] <Limbic_Region> johannes_ - that is a strange error

[20:03] <TimToady> I just get a web-hosting page.  maybe they forgot to renew their name...

[20:03] <Limbic_Region> I found the link and description at http://www.longnow.org/ so perhaps it is an antiquated link

[20:03] <lambdabot> Title: The Long Now Foundation

[20:04] <Limbic_Region> johannes_ have you verified that src/Pugs/pugs_version.h exists?

[20:05] <TimToady> and if not, what happens if you try to create it yourself?

[20:05] <johannes_> Limbic_Region: when the pugs_version.h is beeing created?

[20:05] <johannes_> while Configure.PL ?

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> Configure.PL ?

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> that's parrot

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> not pugs

[20:05] *** jdv79 left
[20:05] <Limbic_Region> pugs should be Makefile.PL

[20:06] <johannes_> yes, Makefile.PL

[20:06] <johannes_> my bad

[20:06] <Limbic_Region> johannes_ - right now at this moment, does it exist?

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> if not, what happens when you try to create it?

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> it is only two lines btw - #undef PUGS_SVN_REVISION and #define PUGS_SVN_REVISION <rev_level>

[20:07] <johannes_> after checkout, there is no such file, at the moment i'm in the Makefile.PL step

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> k

[20:08] <johannes_> after Makefile.PL file still doesn't exist

[20:09] <johannes_> k, i'll try it

[20:09] <Limbic_Region> and if you try to create it by hand?

[20:10] <johannes_> now it compiles

[20:11] * Limbic_Region is trying to reproduce your problem without performing a fresh checkout

[20:11] <TimToady> if you got it from the svn repository, why isn't it the most recent version?

[20:12] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - the pugs_version.h file is dynamically created IIRC

[20:12] <TimToady> which svn repo did you use?

[20:12] <johannes_> i think it is

[20:12] <Limbic_Region> I know that audreyt made some changes to how that works recently

[20:12] <TimToady> what does svn info say?

[20:12] <johannes_> http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk

[20:12] <TimToady> ah, that's derivative.

[20:12] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 13329: /pugs/trunk

[20:12] <TimToady> and will have the wrong version number

[20:13] <Limbic_Region> I am not sure that's a problem - it is updated dynamically

[20:13] <Limbic_Region> not with checkouts

[20:13] <TimToady> stongly recommend using http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs instead

[20:13] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 14536: /

[20:13] <johannes_> ok, i'll test it

[20:13] <Limbic_Region> I just deleted my file, did an svn up, and a perl Makefile.PL and it is still missing

[20:13] <TimToady> it's make that recreates it

[20:13] <Limbic_Region> attempting nmake now

[20:14] <TimToady> but there may well be fixes in there that depend on knowing what the openfoundry rev is, not the perl.org rev.

[20:14] *** gene9 joined
[20:14] <Limbic_Region> yeah - you are definately on the right track

[20:14] <Limbic_Region> mine was created just fine

[20:18] <johannes_> yeh, this works

[20:19] <TimToady> yay!

[20:24] <Limbic_Region> oh, it is close enough to the weekend - TTFN all

[20:35] <johannes_> commit bit == i'm able to commit things?

[20:36] <[particle]> yep

[20:36] <[particle]> like modifying the AUTHORS file

[20:36] <johannes_> at the moment i'm just playing around

[20:37] <[particle]> well, if you're playing around and want to add a test, or fix a typo, you'll be able to if you have a commit bit

[20:39] <TimToady> basically, all of us are just playing around. :)

[20:40] <johannes_> :) u need my email address? [email@hidden.address]
[20:41] <TimToady> a commit bit is on its way.

[20:41] <TimToady> it is customary to add yourself to AUTHORS first just to make sure it's working right.

[20:42] <TimToady> whatever you do after that is up to you.

[20:42] <johannes_> thanks, i'll test in 30min, dinner first

[20:42] <TimToady> you don't need to ask permission.  we operate on the principle of asking forgiveness rather than permission.
