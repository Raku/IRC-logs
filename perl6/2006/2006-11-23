[02:03] <nothingmuch> yes

[02:03] <nothingmuch> it's just shorthand for ( $self->slots )[0]

[02:04] <nothingmuch> but it also dies if there are too many

[07:03] <xnito> i cant see the error

[07:04] <araujo> it isn't an error

[07:04] <araujo> xnito, it is just a small article about postfix notation

[07:04] <araujo> but it is on chinese

[07:05] <araujo> so since i know some chinese speakers hang around the channel, i ask for some help to translate a part of it.

[07:05] <araujo> online translators stink :-P

[07:06] <offby1> google's translation thing _claims_ to be able to translate it, but does absolutely nothing

[07:06] <araujo> probably it's because of .php?

[11:05] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: re $slot: the repo is right, but my darcs "misbehaved" yesterday, after the pull it indicated conflicts, which I just reverted and gave wrong code..

[11:14] <nothingmuch> oh!

[11:14] <nothingmuch> when that happens run 'darcs repair' to make sure everything is OK

[11:14] <nothingmuch> then unpull a bunch of patches, like the last 5

[11:14] <nothingmuch> revert carefully

[11:14] <nothingmuch> and repull

[11:14] <nothingmuch> that tends to sort anything out without needing to think too much

[11:17] <cmarcelo> thanks. I'm a little busy these days but I'm trying to grok your base_roles.txt

[11:17] <nothingmuch> it's an implementation of the STD methods

[11:17] <nothingmuch> like .new, .clone, etc

[11:17] <nothingmuch> in terms of autogenerated metaness

[11:18] <nothingmuch> not 100% correct for p6 since that uses prototype objects

[11:18] <nothingmuch> but for a class driven meta model i think it's pretty good

[11:20] <cmarcelo> nice.. oh, did you and fglock got something done on mp6 MO?

[11:21] <nothingmuch> not that I know of

[11:21] <nothingmuch> i gave him some info

[11:21] <nothingmuch> and he checked in r14840 which could potentially use that

[11:21] <nothingmuch> but I don't know if it actually does or any details for that matter

[11:25] *** xinming joined
[11:35] <anatolyv> anyone has any idea where unspace is allowed in p6?

[11:36] <anatolyv> that is, $foo\   .[something] is legal, but is $fo\   o = something?

[11:55] <Juerd> Good question. I don't know.
