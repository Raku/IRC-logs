[00:00] <audreyt> looks entirely correct

[00:00] <audreyt> cmarcelo++ # nice job

[00:00] <audreyt> (it builds for me now after r10452)

[00:00] <audreyt> now, JudySL :)

[00:00] <audreyt> for JudyHS, I wonder if it's most natural to use a CStringLen as key time

[00:00] <audreyt> s/time/type/

[00:01] <audreyt> probably yes

[00:01] <cmarcelo> audreyt: what ghc version are you using?

[00:01] <audreyt> 6.5-trunk

[00:02] <audreyt>           http://perlcabal.org/~audreyt/tmp/ghc-6.5.20060526-i686-apple-darwin8.tar.bz2

[00:02] <audreyt> no other choice, as GHC 6.4.x won't build on macintel

[00:02] <audreyt> and 6.4.2 is the final release from that branch

[00:03] <SamB> what, no 6.4.2.1?

[00:03] <audreyt> I don't think there'll be one

[00:03] <audreyt> if there will the GHC page hadn't been updated to reflect this

[00:04] <SamB> actually, if they released another, it would probably be called 6.4.3...

[00:06] <cmarcelo> audreyt: nice. well. i'll go for JudySL and JudyHS.. i think by the end of the week this low-level thing is (almost) done..

[00:07] <audreyt> nod. be sure to wrap spinclad's new API

[00:08] <particle_> oh, hi! btw :)

[00:09] <obra> hiya audrey

[00:09] <cmarcelo> i will..

[00:09] <audreyt> cmarcelo: and then we can start talking to #haskell about a generic Map class, and MMap/MutMap, perhaps

[00:10] <audreyt> and start the fun part of API design :)

[00:10] <audreyt> (and map haskell stuff <-> judy Value)

[00:10] <audreyt> obra, particle: hi

[00:16] *** jsiracusa joined
[00:17] <cmarcelo> cool! =) i'll send an email to haskell lists now telling them about the project, giving repo url etc..

[00:19] <Juerd> I'm lost, and shouldn't be here :)

[00:19] <Juerd> Good night :)

[00:20] <audreyt> g'nite and don't dwell on #somnambulism :)

[00:20] <Juerd> Is that sleep walking?

[00:21] <Juerd> My latin's rusty.

[00:21] <audreyt> yeah.

[00:21] <Juerd> I dreamt I was sleep walking last night.

[00:21] <Juerd> Still don't know if I really did it or not.

[00:21] <Juerd> Well, sleep driving partly.

[00:22] <Juerd> Really too bad my navigation GPS doesn't do logging :)

[00:22] <Juerd> Anyway, good night

[12:31] <Limbic_Region> anyone know where I can download just nmake.exe ver [78] without the entire .NET SDK framework?

[12:33] *** jsiracusa joined
[12:52] <bjoern_> try http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe (from perldoc perlmodinstall)

[12:52] <buubot> perlmodinstall - Perl modules: how to install from CPAN. To access this perldoc please type, at a command line, 'perldoc perlmodinstall'. You may also find it at http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodinstall.html

[12:53] *** turrepurre joined
[12:53] <bjoern_> that is of course not the latest version

[12:53] <bjoern_> I don't think that's available as a separate download

[12:54] <bjoern_> I also don't think you need the .NET framework sdk, just the free compiler tools suit should do

[12:54] <bjoern_> in fact, I'm not sure .NET includes nmake

[12:56] <Limbic_Region> bjoern_ - I have it taken care of now, thanks

[12:57] <Limbic_Region> the 1.5 that ships with windows is pretty much useless

[12:58] <Limbic_Region> I am fairly certain that the .NET framework sdk does indeed include nmake since it is required to build things - but I had a kind soul /msg me their copy

[12:59] *** neoesque joined
[13:00] <bjoern_> before MSBuild the .NET way of building things was from the IDE (possibly invoked through the command line) or external tools such as NAnt, I don't think nmake is included... but well
