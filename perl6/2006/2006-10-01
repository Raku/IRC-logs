[02:18] <Limbic_Region> salutations all

[02:19] <audreyt> @tell lanny the bug was because implicit vars weren't ordered lexographically anymore!

[02:19] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[02:19] <audreyt> @tell lanny {$^a <=> $^b} were erroneously taking the params in the wrong order. thanks for spotting this before release!

[02:19] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[02:19] <audreyt> Limbic_Region: greetings

[02:20] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - there are still a few tests that blow up with the windows error I told you about earlier

[02:20] <Limbic_Region> but that has been going on for some time

[02:20] <Limbic_Region> I just accepted it

[02:20] <Limbic_Region> would you like me to run a smoke and give you the exact test names?

[02:24] <audreyt> yes, please

[02:25] <Limbic_Region> running now

[02:25] <Limbic_Region> and I still have to delete several tests before smoking as they hang (already hivemindered)

[02:27] <audreyt> k

[02:31] <Limbic_Region> what did you think about leo taking a less active role in parrot?

[02:33] <audreyt> I don't think about parrot much these days...

[02:33] <audreyt> except when attempting (and failing) to fix embedding

[02:34] <audreyt> not specific to parrot, though, I think a $job where one can deploy one's active free software proejct is a real plus

[02:34] <audreyt> even though it may look like a distraction at first

[02:34] <audreyt> I know that Dan Sugalski (and parrot) benefitted from his deployment of parrot in his prev $job

[02:34] <Limbic_Region> oh definately

[02:34] <audreyt> and jifty/pugs/ghc all benefitted from my day $job

[02:35] <Limbic_Region> I was just thinking that it was a much overdue "break"

[02:35] <audreyt> ^C

[02:36] <audreyt> yeah. although if one's job was utterly unrelated, then the FOSS side may suffer

[02:36] <Limbic_Region> well, that depends on if you are looking at long or short term benefits

[02:37] <Limbic_Region> being away totally for a while can give you perspective and renewed energy

[02:37] <audreyt> that's true too

[02:37] <Limbic_Region> assuming you come back - you may have more to offer than if you had stayed

[02:37] <audreyt> in any case leo deserves a sabbatical :)

[02:38] <Limbic_Region> yep - that was my thinking though I hope code monkeys step up to fill the gap

[02:38] <audreyt> there's certainly a lot of new PDDs to implement recently...

[02:38] <Limbic_Region> yeah, I saw that

[02:39] <Limbic_Region> going to try to build ghc on cygwin again tomorrow - afraid simon and I are talking past one another

[02:39] <audreyt> oy

[02:39] <audreyt> #ghc may help

[02:39] <Limbic_Region> it is strangely quiet

[02:39] <audreyt> I've found them really helpful

[02:39] <audreyt> yeah, it only rises to action when someone raises some bork

[02:39] <TimToady> rehi

[02:39] <Limbic_Region> but I think the issue is that things *should* be getting further along then they are

[02:40] <audreyt> TimToady: greetings!

[02:40] <audreyt> TimToady: quick question. I realized that

[02:40] <Limbic_Region> so I probably need to find out why they aren't before squawkig again

[02:40] <audreyt> 1 < any(@x) 10

[02:40] <audreyt> 1 < any(@x) < 10

[02:40] <audreyt> cannot work the same way as

[02:40] <audreyt> 1 < ($j = any(@x)) < 10

[02:40] <audreyt> i.e. the latter has no way to rewrite into a grep

[02:40] <TimToady> whoever is documenting min and max should probably put them near sort and cmp and eqv with similar parameterization

[02:41] <audreyt> and since it's a syntactical rewrite it doesn't matter if it occurs in the first two operand pos or not

[02:41] <pasteling> Someone at 220.135.90.73 pasted "S09 patch" (45 lines, 1.6K) at http://sial.org/pbot/20088

[02:41] <audreyt> so I patched S09 (see above) to say that

[02:42] *** lanny joined
[02:42] <TimToady> somewhere I proposed that that be 1 < those(@x) < 10 instead

[02:42] <audreyt> where those() is also syntactic?

[02:42] <TimToady> to make the desire for grep rewrite explicit

[02:42] <Limbic_Region> lanny - did you see TimToady's comment from a minute ago?

[02:42] <audreyt> what do you think about

[02:42] <TimToady> and leave any() alone

[02:42] <audreyt> 1 < list(@x) < 10

[02:42] <audreyt> ?

[02:42] <TimToady> might work

[02:42] <audreyt> those() doesn't anything in isolation troubles me

[02:42] <TimToady> we're getting dangerously close to list comprehensions here. :)

[02:43] <lanny> Limbic_Region: Missed it.  There's always a delay between the logs and logging on through the browser irc

[02:43] <lambdabot> lanny: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[02:43] <Limbic_Region> lanny - [22:41] <TimToady> whoever is documenting min and max should probably put them near sort and cmp and eqv with similar parameterization

[02:43] <Limbic_Region> I know you worked on sort.t

[02:43] <audreyt> TimToady: we'll just call it "list() comprehension"

[02:43] <TimToady> lanny: was it you asking about min/max?

[02:43] <lanny> Got it.  :)

[02:44] <lanny> Yes.  There's a lot of tests on them and Damian mentioned them in p.p6.lang.

[02:44] <lanny> Wasn't sure about just going in to Functions.pod and fixing up whatever I thought was out of whack though.  I'll do the needful.

[02:44] <audreyt> TimToady??

[02:45] <TimToady> if something's missing, better to whack it in somewhere--can always be moved later.

[02:45] <TimToady> audreyt: was just commenting on your list() comprehensible remark

[02:45] <lanny> I noticed it but the tests were what did the work.  I'm just glad it wasn't in op1MinMax.  I must have looked through the code for 30 minutes trying to find the bug.

[02:48] <Limbic_Region> audreyt - the first test that causes Win32 to have the windows level error is t/regex/from_perl6_rules/codevars.t or combchar.t (it happens somewhere in between the two)

[02:54] *** mauke_ joined
[02:58] <Limbic_Region> ok, hivemindered

[02:59] <TimToady> audreyt: did you notice that .pick merely defaults to .pick(1) now?

[02:59] <TimToady> and that .pick(*) is a shuffle?

[03:01] <Limbic_Region> ?eval say (1..10).pick

[03:01] <evalbot_r13761> OUTPUT[9 ] Bool::True

[03:01] <TimToady> ?eval (^100).pick

[03:01] <evalbot_r13761> 26.0

[03:03] <audreyt> TimToady: no, that's cool

[03:03] <TimToady> I keep wondering if there's some way to refactor the 0-or-1-ary rand into something saner.

[03:04] <audreyt> also,

[03:04] <audreyt> $x = list(@y) ~~ {...}

[03:04] <TimToady> make people write 1.rand maybe.

[03:04] <audreyt> should comprehend as well

[03:04] <audreyt> the list-context constraint feels wrong here

[03:04] <TimToady> those @x that match works there

[03:05] <TimToady> if that's what it means

[03:05] <audreyt> yup

[03:05] <audreyt> $x = @y.grep:{...}

[03:05] <audreyt> same as this

[03:14] <svnbot6> r13764 | audreyt++ |     (2, 3, 5)

[03:16] <lanny> TimToady: On pick() is there any reason not to allow @a.pick(*, :replacement)?

[03:17] <lanny> Ooh.  Well that was a bad example.  @a.pick(7, :replacement);

[03:17] <TimToady> seems like that would be hyperable somehow

[03:18] <TimToady> but that would certainly be more readable in some sense.

[03:18] <wolverian> * seems quite hyper already to me, intuitively

[03:18] <TimToady> well, @a.pick(*, :repl) would presumably give you an eternal supply h

[03:18] <TimToady> s/h//

[03:18] <lanny> R has a sample() that will take a vector and do random selection with or without replacement.  Very useful in a Stats system but since pick() is already there seems like the place for it.

[03:20] <lanny> Hmm.  "Pick a number from 1..100".  repeat { (1..100).pick(*, :repl); }

[03:21] <TimToady> repeat isn't legal without a conditional, btw

[03:21] <lanny> Darn.  Had a long "discussion" with Juerd today about for ^$num { do_something; } for loops of a given length.  He's agin' it and I can see his arguments.

[03:22] <TimToady> yeah, I read it all.

[03:22] <lanny> I guess for 0..^$num { do_something(); } is as easy.

[03:24] <lanny> ah.  loop { ...pick(); }

[03:24] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - even the part where I said you were subject to losing er uh, changing your mind

[03:27] <Limbic_Region> TTFN all - almost tomorrow

[03:27] <TimToady> laters

[03:29] <Khisanth> besides you can only lose something if you still have it

[03:32] <lanny> If sort, min, max, cmp, and eqv all have the same MMD signature (is there a name for the collective signature of all Codes of the same name?) any objection to renaming it.  CmpCriterion maybe?  OrderCriterion?  PosetCriterion?

[03:32] <lanny> SortCriterion would also make sense but some folks might wonder at sort being the kernel.

[03:33] <TimToady> Ordering?

[03:33] <lanny> blah(@values, Ordering @by);  subset Ordering of Sig | KeyExt | Comp | OrderingPair;

[03:34] <TimToady> seems really strange to call that a subset

[03:35] <lanny> It makes coding it in Perl 6 a touch easier since given/when gets a bit easier.

[03:36] <lanny> subset of Any where { self ~~ Sig | KeyExt | Comp | OrderingPair } if it makes you feel better.  :)

[03:36] <TimToady> whew!

[03:37] <TimToady> so maybe it's really subset Ordering where Sig | KeyExt | Comp | OrderingPair;

[03:37] <TimToady> and it just defaults to "of Any"

[03:39] <lanny> I need to read up on S05 so I can start talking the grammar but that would seem to have where taking a Junction or a Code.  It's good sugar but was wondering earlier if everything needed couldn't be state with subset of Blah where {  }?

[03:40] <TimToady> after all, you can't actually have an Ordering that is more than one of those...

[03:40] <lanny> * stated

[03:40] <lanny> Agreed

[03:40] *** kanru joined
[03:41] <TimToady> well, sure, in the same sense that every "when Blah" can be stated in terms of when {...}

[03:41] <TimToady> but syntactic sugar is sweet

[03:42] <TimToady> and the whole point of smart matching is to sweep as much dwimmery into one spot so that we can use it all sorts of other places.

[03:42] <TimToady> including run-time type checking.

[03:42] <TimToady> and MMD

[03:43] <lanny> Yes.

[03:44] <lanny> I like syntactic sugar.  Maybe that hsould have been, "It's good sugar and..."

[03:45] <lanny> In the end all sugar goes to something canonical (or circular) and I like those small islands of stability sometimes.  Especially against the churning sea of the specs.

[03:59] <lanny> Back in Modern Algebra that was | but you just used that one up.  :)

[03:59] <svnbot6> r13765 | lanny++ | * minmax.t - fixed buggy test

[04:00] <TimToady> just wondering, since chaining operators are special cased in various ways, and % is often used as a logical that way

[04:00] <TimToady> but maybe we want ?/ and !/

[04:00] <lanny> It would be nice.  Would save untold == 0 on $n % 2 == 0;

[04:01] <TimToady> and list(^100) ~~ { $_ % 2 == 0 }

[04:05] <lanny> Of course anyone that wanted those could just code em.  How do you tell when the Specs end and when "stuff the developer should do" begins?

[04:06] <TimToady> the Specs end when I get tired.  :)

[04:06] <lanny> :)

[04:08] <lanny> Course if you coded it as an infix then you'd have to grep over a list to extract from a list.  Or MMD it I guess.

[04:11] <TimToady> I'd do ?% and !% in a shot if they weren't bassackwards...

[04:11] <lanny> Perl6 pass one question of the mini-mental physical.  News at 11.

[04:11] <lanny> They are "more" correct but I really think ?/ and !/ will be easier to remember.

[04:12] <TimToady> but don't really decompose to not a / b

[04:13] <TimToady> whereas !% would, unless we make ?% mean not a % b

[04:13] <lanny> You could do that.  If you just spell out, "yes, it's backwards.  sue me" then I think you could chalk it up as a win and move on.

[04:15] <lanny> You hardly need the !% op from above since that's just !% := %

[04:16] <TimToady> if ?% were chaining you'd get !?% for free.  :) !?!?!

[04:16] <buffer> i want left behind: the rising

[04:16] <lanny> The wheels within wheels of Perl 6 remind me a LOT of lisp.  It's gonna be a great language.

[04:16] <buffer> anyone have it

[04:18] *** buffer left
[04:23] <TimToady> maybe all the boolean ?^ ?& !| etc belong in chained ops rather than + and *

[04:23] <lanny> sort { $^a <=> $^b } is insensitive(&abs), @values;

[04:24] <TimToady> sort { +abs($_) }, @values

[04:25] <TimToady> sort -> Num $_ { .abs }, @values

[04:26] <lanny> Oh yes.  You *could* do it those ways.  But if someone tacks on is insensitive all I've got for a meaning right now is "see if $a.can('lc')"

[04:26] <TimToady> sorry, didn't mean to trammel your very valid point.  :)

[04:26] <lanny> Personally I'd like to see insensitive go away for writing what you mean and descending go away for reverse().

[04:27] <TimToady> sort :(-Num), @values

[04:28] <lanny> Is that a new kind of smiley?

[04:28] <lanny> :)  But what I'm really wonder is if the '-' is a typo on Num or not.

[04:28] <lanny> Wow.  What great typing.  Time for sleep soon.

[04:29] <TimToady> right now it would be a typo, but we could have +/- "zones" like * and |

[04:29] <TimToady> or just sort :(Num is descending), @values

[04:30] <TimToady> descending is terribly cobolesque though

[04:31] <lanny> That's already specced as I read it.

[04:31] <lanny> And how do you define descending for sort :(Dog is descending), @values;

[04:31] <TimToady> depends on whether the type does Ordered in the first place

[04:31] <lanny> Unless there's something like Dog does Order;

[04:32] <TimToady> anything that does Ordered presumably has a default ordering.

[04:32] * lanny nods.

[04:32] <TimToady> that's what makes Sig so powerful in sorts et al.

[04:32] <lanny> Yeah.  That seems to have dropped out of the specs lately or google can't tease it out but I recall that from an earlier question I asked in here.

[04:33] <TimToady> it's implicit in the Sig as criterion idea though

[04:34] <lanny> Yes but implicit ideas in specs that others might code your language from to be standard might leave a lot of room for interesting Perl 6's.

[04:34] <TimToady> that's kinda why we're pushing to the the Haskell one done first.  :)

[04:34] <TimToady> s/the/get/

[04:35] <TimToady> even if it's not The Spec, it can at least point the True Way

[04:35] <TimToady> and if we're really lucky someone will have installed a regression test for the way pugs does it.

[04:35] <lanny> Yeah.  :)  Saw that coming.

[04:36] <TimToady> I've really been delighted with how that's been working out over the last while though.

[04:37] <TimToady> I feel like the process is convergent.

[04:37] <TimToady> things will certainly diverge later, and that's okay

[04:38] <TimToady> but we're at a golden moment right now when the leverage on the future is spectacularly huge, for good and ill

[04:39] <TimToady> I think the intersection of what fits in audrey's brain and what fits in my brain will be something really useful.

[04:39] <lanny> Yeah.  Nice to watch y'all play off each other.

[04:40] <TimToady> well, I oversimplify, of course, since @brains >>> 2

[04:41] <TimToady> @brains ⋙  2

[04:41] <lambdabot> I think so, Brain, but isn't that why they invented tube socks?

[04:43] <TimToady> much greater than is just ≫

[04:44] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[04:45] <lanny> In role Ordered presumably there is cmp() to set up the ordering.  Does it need a desensitize() to state how to make something is insensitive?

[04:45] <TimToady> more like :canonicalize($how) or some such

[04:46] *** mako132_ joined
[04:46] <TimToady> that's really what KeyExt is doing

[04:46] <lanny> Ah yes.

[04:47] <TimToady> anyway, I prefer to state it in the positive

[04:47] <ruz> hi, I don't get why "\Z(?!\n)" can be used instead of "\z" in perl5 code. And couldn't find anything related in docs. could you give me a hint?

[04:48] <lanny> sort :(Dog is not_quite_there_on_the_empathy_thing_but_hopefully_soon), @values might be a bit rough just to say that Dog's are insensitive beasts.

[04:48] <TimToady> :D

[04:49] <lanny> Off to find a tube sock.  Cheers.

[04:49] <TimToady> ruz: \Z means \z|\n\z

[04:49] <TimToady> so the negative lookahead falsifies the second part.

[04:50] <TimToady> fortunately, Perl 6 has neither \z nor \Z

[04:51] <TimToady> but I have no clue why anyone would use the lookahead when \z works fine (except maybe for really old Perls?)

[04:51] <ruz> is it possible that some perl 5.x version has no support for \z?

[04:51] <TimToady> could be

[04:51] *** Tman joined
[04:51] <TimToady> I think that's right, which is why there's \A and \Z and why \z doesn't match.

[04:51] <TimToady> \Z and \z ought to have been switched.

[04:52] <Tman> what's the general consensus on how far along pugs is/how far it has to go?

[04:52] <ruz> TimToady: yep, but do you have time machine?

[04:53] <TimToady> it's come along spectacularly far, it still has a long way to go, and insane people are starting to play with it for real things.

[04:53] <ruz> :) ok, thanks, I think there is no another reason

[04:54] <Tman> hmm.

[04:54] <Tman> what kinds of things are missing?

[04:54] <TimToady> we haven't really installed the Moose meta-object protocol yet, so the OO support is still chewing gum and bailing wire.

[04:55] * Tman doesn't know what that is :p

[04:55] <TimToady> we're still in the process of bootstrapping the compiler in itself.

[04:55] <TimToady> and it's almost completely unoptimized.

[04:56] <TimToady> we're going for correctness first.

[04:56] <Tman> right

[04:56] <TimToady> but the P5ish subset of P6 works pretty well, if you ignore the fact that we switched regex engines recently and it's still pretty creaky

[04:57] <Tman> cool

[04:57] <TimToady> would you like to help?

[04:58] <TimToady> knowing any of Perl | Haskell | English is a plus

[04:59] <Tman> no Haskell and not a whole lot of experience with Perl (but some)

[05:00] <TimToady> we need the viewpoint of people who are just getting into it as well.

[05:00] <TimToady> fresh eyes are always useful

[05:00] <Tman> yeah

[05:01] <TimToady> anyway, I can offer you a commit bit if you'd like

[05:01] <TimToady> a lot of people just go in and start whacking on tests.

[05:01] <Tman> I'll look into it

[05:01] <TimToady> after finding holes in the specs

[05:02] <Tman> not really any experience with interpreters either

[05:02] <Tman> which is worrying

[05:02] <Tman> :/

[05:02] <TimToady> that matters very little, I think.

[05:02] <TimToady> since Perl 6 is agnostic as to whether it's compiled or interpreted.

[05:03] <Tman> well, with parsing I mean

[05:03] <TimToady> anyway, you're welcome to hang around until you get the "itch"

[05:03] <Tman> x)

[05:03] <Tman> okay

[05:05] <TimToady> reading through the specs is a good place to start, and if you read the ones that are backannotated with passing/failing tests, you can get a feeling for how far along pugs is.

[05:05] <Tman> okay

[05:05] <Tman> cool

[05:06] <TimToady> you can get an annotated view of the synopses by following SYN links from http://m19s28.vlinux.de/cgi-bin/pugs-smokeserv.pl?

[15:34] <audreyt> become an array of captures with each element representing one feed

[15:34] <audreyt> that will let v6.pm get zipp() and each()

[15:35] <clkao> so there zipp and each in prelude?

[15:35] <audreyt> zip, not zipp, sorry

[15:35] <audreyt> yeah. see t/builtins/container/cat.t

[16:05] <clkao> in "S6/Multidimensional argument list binding", the linked test has "*@;AoA".  I don't find any reference to @;<bareword> in spec.  or is it just changed to *@@AoA ?

[16:21] <audreyt> yes, pugs doesn't implement that

[16:21] <audreyt> yet

[16:21] <audreyt> (bbl)

[16:21] <clkao> i will leave that as broken

[16:22] <clkao> but is the '@@AoA' right for the return value? or is it @AoA ?

[16:23] <clkao> and i don't quite understand how you bind multi named

[16:23] <audreyt> both will work

[16:23] <audreyt> the AoA is actually AoC

[16:24] <audreyt> %(@@c[0]) is named

[16:24] *** justatheory joined
[16:24] <clkao> so foo(blah => 1; (2,3,4);bzz => 2, fnord => 3) would do what ?

[16:25] <clkao> or each slice would have their pos and named?

[16:25] <audreyt> yes.

[16:26] <audreyt> @@c[0]<blah>

[16:26] <audreyt> @@c[1]<fnord>

[16:26] <clkao> ok. i think i kind of understand. but i need to keep the c structure in runtime, so we can bind them later as well

[16:26] <audreyt> really & :)

[16:26] <clkao> you mean @@c[2]<fnord>

[16:28] * Juerd needs to learn all these new metasyntactic variables.
