[01:10] <dduncan> so, according to audreyt's newest blog, Pugs now passes all its tests, and so I interpret that it is about preflight time save for changelogging ...

[01:11] <dduncan> I will now cleanly build and smoke the current revision

[01:11] <Captain_Fourier> hmm im playing with pugs now

[01:11] <dduncan> r10557

[01:11] <Captain_Fourier> and if i enter expressions as seperate lines i get weird errors

[01:11] <dduncan> that will take me a few hours ... unless there is another preflight I should wait for ...

[03:43] <dduncan> nevermind, the smoker isn't going alphabetic anymore

[03:44] <dduncan> I'm very pleased to report that Pugs now actually seems to be honoring my concurrent=2 setting, and utilizing both CPUs on my machine with 2 separate Pugs processes

[03:44] <dduncan> some ++ to whomever got that to work

[03:49] <dduncan> previously, only 1 Pugs process was running for me, despite the longstanding concurrent=2 setting

[03:50] <dduncan> audreyt, it appears that your r10554 made this work, though perhaps accidentally

[03:51] <dduncan> ... since that commit only seemed to be about adjusting balances, not splitting the balance in the first place

[04:19] <cmarcelo> audreyt: ping?

[04:27] <Captain_Fourier> im still curious how does pugs perform compared to ruby

[04:27] <Captain_Fourier> or perl5

[04:27] <bsb> dduncan: http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/06/6212_releng_res.html for smoke_concurrent

[04:29] <dduncan> bsb, I see that

[04:29] <dduncan> however, smoke_concurrent has been a config option for something like a year now, or half a year ...

[04:29] <dduncan> I've always set it to 2, but it never ran more than one process, until today

[04:31] <dduncan> supposedly other people with dual processors got the desired behaviour months ago, but I didn't

[04:32] <bsb> ah, ok

[04:34] <gaal> when did it break? it was added like a year ago!

[04:34] <gaal> (hi, all)

[04:48] <cmarcelo> gaal: hi

[06:02] <gaal> dduncan: try upping concurrent by one. you might shave off a minute or two.

[06:03] <dduncan> hello

[06:03] <gaal> (or not, but it's worth a shot)

[06:03] <gaal> hi :)

[06:03] <dduncan> you mean using 3 instead of 2?

[06:03] <gaal> yes

[06:04] <dduncan> shaving a minute or 2 is irrelevant when the run time is 4 hours with 1 process, and 2 hours with 2, that is now working

[06:04] <dduncan> but thanks anyway

[06:04] <dduncan> unless that minute will scale up for my slower machine

[06:04] <dduncan> to something more

[06:04] <gaal> well, 1 or 2 may turn out to be 5 or 10

[06:05] <dduncan> in that case, what would happen if I set it to 4, say?  can raising it like that make things worse?

[06:06] <gaal> there is no hard and fast rule, but in general (assuming you don't run out of ram) you want to make sure that if something is blocked on io, another test can take cpu

[06:06] <dduncan> well, I have 768MB of RAM ... I will experiment to see what uses the most but not too much RAM

[06:06] <dduncan> thanks for the tip

[06:07] <gaal> and since our task allocation is very KISS (we just cut the tests to n pieces at start and spawn them off), if one process was unlucky and got a lot of long ones, it'll be running alone in the last duration of the test run

[06:07] <dduncan> fyi, with that much RAM, disk swapping is done when compiling Pugs, though just running the tests it has over 200MB free

[06:07] <dduncan> I'll see to getting more RAM some time

[06:08] <dduncan> hopefully a 1GB stick is cheap

[06:08] <dduncan> good quality stuff that is

[06:08] <gaal> this kind of work distribution is unfair, but we have so many tests we assume it's not going to bite too hard, and also, fixing it portably is Hard

[06:08] <gaal> no actually it's just hard

[06:08] <dduncan> no problem

[06:09] <gaal> 1gb stick for a 4 year old machine may not be very cheap...

[06:09] <dduncan> over time, though I expect that when the test suite settles down and pugs/perl6 gets close to 1.0, we should have a better idea what the generally slow tests are, and perhaps arrange the test dirs such that things are divided up well

[06:10] <gaal> but you oughta be OK with 768M if oyou aren't doing much other stuff at the same time.

[06:10] <dduncan> the RAM type is DDR SDRAM, if that says anything

[06:10] <dduncan> fyi, during smoking I"m fine

[06:10] <gaal> dduncan: nah, by that time we can rewrite the harness in perl6 and portable threading will be easier :)

[06:10] <dduncan> its when compiling the Haskell that I get disk swapping, and general slowdowns

[06:11] <dduncan> eg, during 'make'

[06:11] <gaal> sure, ghc is hungry. but a pack of fifteen pugs would also be hungry :)

[06:11] <gaal> gotta $work some &

[06:11] <dduncan> good $time

[15:16] <TimToady> audreyt: ping

[15:18] <TimToady> audreyt: on = parsing, I'm looking at how the context rules are starting to look like your old dwimmer, and wondering whether a better approach is to separate the parsing concern from the context concern.

[15:18] <TimToady> we could say that only $x = ... parses as a scalar assignment, and everything else parses as list assignment.

[15:19] <TimToady> but then say that the context rules are more like the dwimmy version.

[15:20] <TimToady> anyway, that's my pre-caffiene thought...

[15:21] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - it looks like she has her parrot hat on today

[15:21] *** stennie joined
[15:21] <TimToady> that's okay, I'm bugging her about some parrot issues too.  :)

[15:21] <Limbic_Region> of course, she can get away with wearing many hats simultaneously and still look very fashionable

[15:25] * gaal conjures a mental image of audrey wearing a hat on each tine

[15:27] <rgs> scalar(@list) = $value

[15:27] *** bradleym joined
[15:27] <TimToady> I'm sure some mathematicians would like that...

[15:28] <TimToady> but a Perl 5 programmer would expect it to set the length.

[15:28] <rgs> that feels a bit like $#array = $size - 1

[15:28] <rgs> so, yes

[15:29] <rgs> anyway, my point was that on the left, you can have something that is a scalar, but that doesn't parse as a scalar

[15:29] <rgs> like the return value of substr() (better example than scalar())

[15:29] <TimToady> when I say "parse as a scalar" here, all I'm meaning is how the right side of = is parsed

[15:29] <TimToady> precedence-wise

[15:30] <rgs> hmm precedence, ok

[15:30] <TimToady> that is, if you say MUMBLE = 1, 2

[15:30] <TimToady> is the 2 part of the assignment?

[15:30] * rgs notes that most of the discussion in #perl6 happens out of his timezone

[15:30] <TimToady> about the only use case for the scalar form is

[15:31] <TimToady> loop ($a = 1, $b = 2; ...)

[15:31] <rgs> $a = 1, $b = 2 if $condition

[15:32] <TimToady> yes, that's certainly what a P5 programmer would expect.

[15:32] <TimToady> but is it uncommon enough that we could make people write

[15:32] <TimToady> ($a = 1), ($b = 2) if $condition.

[15:33] <TimToady> I'm just trying to keep the parsing rules simple, but not too simple...

[15:33] <rgs> cleaner, also, visually

[15:33] <TimToady> and should it be ($a = 1; $b = 2) if $condition?

[15:34] <particle_> why not {} ?

[15:34] <TimToady> {} would require a () to execute

[15:35] <particle_> ah, yes, 'if' is a statement modifier, not block modifier

[15:36] <rgs> also, does this return a list, as in @x = ($a = 1, $b = 3)

[15:36] *** neoesque joined
[15:40] <TimToady> As currently specced, ($a = 1; $b = 2) presumably returns a multi-dimensional list, which would flatten to an ordinary list unless bound to an @@ variable.

[15:43] *** Qiang joined
[15:49] *** fishb0t joined
[15:49] <TimToady> loop(($a = 1; $b = 2); $c; $d++) does not read very well.

[15:50] <TimToady> but maybe (;;) form is just borken C-age we should jettison

[15:50] <rgs> that form of loop is awful anyway

[15:50] <TimToady> loop $a = 1; $b = 2 while $c next $d++ {...}

[15:50] <TimToady> gives us

[15:51] <TimToady> loop $a = 10 until $a == 0 next $a-- {...}

[15:51] <TimToady> getting kind of Algolesque there...

[15:54] <TimToady> I dunno, my eyes go all mush when I try to read that...

[15:54] <audreyt> TimToady: the segfault is due to PGE not supporting @x in rules

[15:54] <TimToady> loop $a = 10; until $a == 0; next $a-- {...}

[15:54] <audreyt> s/segfault/IMCC error/

[15:54] <audreyt> but I'll make it nonfatal

[15:54] <rgs> maybe write NEXT in upper case.

[15:54] <TimToady> okay, thanks

[15:55] <audreyt> (parrot+perl5 embed works here now)

[15:55] <TimToady> cool

[15:55] <TimToady> what do you think of only $a = being parsed scalar, with context a separate concern?

[15:56] <rgs> (my eyes never go mush anymore. side-effect of staring all day at a language whose symbol is an onion:)

[15:56] <TimToady> or just parsing everything list?

[15:57] <PerlJam> good morrow #perl6

[15:57] <Juerd> TimToady: I think C-style loop can be left out of the language completely, and implemented as an optionally importable macro.

[15:57] <PerlJam> Juerd: I agree!

[15:57] <Juerd> That clearly indicates the social status of the construct, without taking it away from those who want it.

[15:58] <TimToady> loop $a = 1; $b = 2; $c = 3; while $x; $x-- {...} is also a possibility.

[15:59] <Juerd> TimToady: I find all variants unclear.

[15:59] <Juerd> Hard to grok, error prone, and annoying to read.

[15:59] * PerlJam had to read it approximately 5 times before he understood what it was supposed to mean.

[16:00] <integral> it certainly challenge's CL loop for incomprehensibility

[16:00] <TimToady> :)

[16:00] <clkao> what?

[16:00] <Juerd> clkao: Do you have a highlight on CL? :)

[16:00] * clkao loops

[16:00] <clkao> no, i just happened to see it

[16:00] <Juerd> Ah :)

[16:00] <integral> *challenges CL's

[16:00] <Juerd> Mental highlight :)

[16:01] <clkao> a friend always do /me -> CL to indicate he is going to the cambrdige library

[16:01] <PerlJam> loop {...} is nice, but the C-style variant not so much.

[16:03] <TimToady> I'm just wondering if there's some kind of thing that says "while {...}" is just a degenerate case of "loop while {...}"

[16:03] <TimToady> where "loop" sets up the possibility of extra shenanigans.

[16:04] <Juerd> { my $i; loop :pre{ $i = 0 } :check{ $i < 15 } :next{ $i++ } { ... } }  # ugly, but comprehensible

[16:05] <PerlJam> Juerd: ETOOMANYBRACES

[16:05] <Juerd> PerlJam: As I said: ugly.

[16:06] <TimToady> loop ($a = 0) while $a < 10; $a-- {...}

[16:06] <Juerd> The greatest trouble with the C-style loop is that it was created without lexical scope in mind.

[16:06] <TimToady> which is fine, since we don't have any -> binding going on.

[16:07] *** ruoso joined
[16:07] <TimToady> but yes, if you wanted $a scoped...

[16:07] <Juerd> loop { $_ = 0 }, { $_ < 10 }, { $_-- } -> $a { ... }

[16:07] *** Aankhen`` joined
[16:07] <TimToady> pardon me while I find a bucket...

[16:08] <Juerd> :)

[16:08] <Juerd> I'm not looking for something that's nice to read, because that doesn't exist.

[16:08] <Juerd> It makes no sense in our world to want three statements that are executed at different times, together in one block.

[16:09] <TimToady> well, I think it's still loop ($a = 0; $a < 10; $a++) and only $a = does scalar parsing on the rhs.

[16:09] <Juerd> If you must have C-style loops, then that may be the best way to do it.

[16:09] <PerlJam> Is it really that important to have some looping construct where initialization, conditional testing, and umm ... tail-of-iteration processing are all mentioned up front?

[16:10] <Juerd> PerlJam: If you want it, you can still do it without loop

[16:10] <TimToady> psychologically, it's valuable.

[16:10] <Juerd> PerlJam: Something like: { my $i = 0; while ($i < 10) { NEXT { $i++ } ... } }

[16:10] <Juerd> TimToady: I doubt that.

[16:11] <PerlJam> TimToady: why do you say so?

[16:11] <TimToady> "Here's everything you need to know about the control of this loop."

[16:11] <TimToady> "All in one convenient place".

[16:11] <Juerd> TimToady: But it's incredibly rare that a loop is best expressed listless.

[16:12] <Juerd> And when you do build a list (lazy or not), you already have everything up front.

[16:12] <Juerd> It's a bad idea to put ugly stuff in the language that is never needed, and nice to have only in extreme circumstances.

[16:13] <Juerd> In fact, C-style for is mostly fun for golfing.

[16:13] <Juerd> And obfu.

[16:13] <PerlJam> Maybe it's just my brain, but I don't ever think of loop control in that fashion.  I always tell myself "that first thing happens only once, the second thing at the beginning of each iteration and the the third thing at the end".  If it were written more while-loopy, it would be slightly better because I wouldn't have to remind myself of the timing of the parts.

[16:13] <TimToady> there are problems and programmers that will tend toward the C idiom.

[16:13] <Juerd> TimToady: Making it importable fixes that.

[16:14] <Juerd> And makes these programmers conscious of the fact that there are alternatives, and that those alternatives are to be preferred.

[16:15] <Juerd> I'm not saying the construct shouldn't be offered at all. It should be, but not by default.

[16:15] <PerlJam> if it didn't exist in perl6, I'd be half-inclined to create that syntax calling as "cfor (A; B; C) { ... }"

[16:15] <Juerd> IMO, the name of the construct is least relevant, but I like "cfor"

[16:16] <PerlJam> Juerd: sure, but note that the parens are important too  :)

[16:16] <TimToady> FAQ: "What's a cf or?"

[16:16] <Juerd> PerlJam: They are.

[16:17] <TimToady> Yeah, well, you're good at that. :P

[16:17] <Juerd> particle_: Much better expressed with a list.

[16:18] <particle_> i'm just sayin' it'll happen

[16:18] <Juerd> particle_: Lists can be lazy now

[16:18] <Juerd> particle_: Of course it will, and that's why the construct should be offered.

[16:18] <Juerd> I'm just saying that making people conscious about it, and keeping the thing out of normal teaching etc may be a good idea.

[16:18] <TimToady> well, I'm not sure if any of this helps me with assignment parsing...

[16:19] <Juerd> I can argue assignment parsing three ways, so I'm fine with either solution.

[16:19] <PerlJam> TimToady: yes.

[16:19] <particle_> for( $tangent= 0; ...

[16:21] <TimToady> this is all about as easy as a protein-folding problem...

[16:21] <TimToady> but I think we're solving it much the same way that nature does.

[16:21] <TimToady> just keep rattling around till you find a lower-energy state...

[16:23] <Juerd> I hope we can de better than nature.

[16:23] <particle_> perhaps 'metaphysics' is more appropriate

[16:24] <PerlJam> particle_: so where's the moral equivalent to moose?  :)

[16:25] <TimToady> I think moose and squirrel are morally equivalent.

[16:25] <TimToady> Boris and Natasha are bad though.

[16:25] <PerlJam> TimToady: Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!

[16:26] <TimToady> that trick never works

[16:38] <PerlJam> It would be much nicer if he had a wayforward machine so he could peek ahead at what perl6 looks like and then just design it that way.  :)

[17:50] <audreyt> it's not really a bug...

[17:50] <audreyt> the statement "if" has no return value

[17:51] <Captain_Fourier> but thanks for the explanation

[17:51] <TimToady> statement "if" has to be able to have a return value if it's the last statement in a block.

[17:58] <audreyt> clkao: that's tomorrow

[17:58] <audreyt> TimToady: you mean upon parsing it's always listop unless very-clearly unary

[17:58] <audreyt> and cxt becomes dynamic?

[17:58] <TimToady> as discussed in BL, possibility of only $a = parsing as scalar

[17:59] <TimToady> everything else parses as list,

[17:59] <TimToady> but context is dwum semantically

[17:59] <audreyt> i.e. cxt is no longer statically inferrable even locally

[17:59] <TimToady> either at compile or run time.

[17:59] <audreyt> but if compile time, then certainly parse time as well, no?

[17:59] <audreyt> same amount of information

[17:59] <TimToady> but could be analyzed after the parse is done.

[18:00] <audreyt> but all info is present before we see the =

[18:00] <audreyt> it can't depend on RHS

[18:00] <TimToady> true

[18:00] <audreyt> so analysis is going to give the same result

[18:00] <audreyt> iff it can be done statically

[18:00] <TimToady> I'm just getting the jitters about the current formulation.

[18:01] <TimToady> mostly from an explanatory perspective

[18:01] *** elmex_ joined
[18:01] <TimToady> but I suppose "it dwims" is sufficient most of the time.

[18:01] <audreyt> understood, but I think it's easier to couple them

[18:01] <audreyt> otherwise

[18:01] <audreyt> "it parses as listop but runs the expressions asif it's a scalar"

[18:01] <audreyt> is a bit unprecedented.

[18:01] <TimToady> okay, then I'll leave it as is currently (note that it's ANY[SIMPLE] though currently.

[18:01] <audreyt> k

[18:02] <TimToady> not just $a[SIMPLE]

[18:02] <audreyt> k

[18:02] <TimToady> is this something that slowed down the parser before?

[18:02] <audreyt> can you find some soul to write tests for that? :)

[18:02] <audreyt> the runtime actually

[18:03] <audreyt> it's currently dynamically inferred on each assignment call

[18:03] <audreyt> I'd like to lift it to parsetime

[18:03] <TimToady> at run time?  curious.

[18:03] <TimToady> sure

[18:03] <audreyt> at run time = because I depend on funsig

[18:03] <TimToady> I guess MMD would force runtime

[18:03] <audreyt> and funcsig can change

[18:03] <TimToady> righto

[18:03] <audreyt> yes.

[18:03] <TimToady> okay.  I can probably write some tests myself.

[22:46] <leo> audreyt: linking pugs/bugs with embedded parrot seems to need 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...', *if* parrot isn't installed (linux/x86)

[22:53] <TimToady> leo: I always install parrot, and I'm seeing the segfaults too, if that's what you're talking about.

[22:54] <bx420> if pugs is functional and it's adopted.  is it equivalent to the real perl?

[22:54] <leo> no segv - it's not even building w/o export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

[22:54] <TimToady> k

[22:54] <leo> testing now

[22:54] <bx420> in the sense that Perl 5 was written?....i guess perl 5 is in C?

[22:54] <TimToady> bx420: what do you mean by "functional", "adopted", and "real"?

[22:55] <bx420> i don't know.  i'm asking if you can take pugs and rename it #!/usr/bin/perl

[22:55] <bx420> and it would be like Perl 5.....the real thing?

[22:55] <bx420> the better perl

[22:55] <bx420> 6

[22:56] <bx420> i'm confused about the new name

[22:56] <TimToady> at this point pugs makes no attempt to try to emulate Perl 5.

[22:56] <bx420> it could'd been perl6 unfinished/work in progress

[22:56] *** jsiracusa joined
[22:56] <QtPlatypus> If your asking will pugs ever be a drop in replacement for perl(lowercase) I don't think it will ever be.

[22:56] <mugwump> bx420: atm perl6 is a language, not an implementation.  there are at least 3 implementations in progress

[22:56] <bx420> they don't call whatever the latest python by a different name so i guess that's where it confuses me

[22:57] <szbalint> bx420: what new name?

[22:57] <mugwump> eg, with java you have to talk about language version and which JVM/compiler you are using

[22:58] <bx420> this is strange i guess.  what's the need for competing implementations?

[22:58] <bx420> there's only one gcc, perl, python, etc.  i guess you can say borland C++, ms C++, etc.

[22:58] <QtPlatypus> Mostly its to get around the bootstrapping .

[22:58] <mugwump> they're complementary in many ways, not competing

[22:58] <leo> bx420: at least CPython, Jython, PyPy come to my mind and there are more (e.g. the .net thingy)

[22:59] <TimToady> and in the sense that they compete, it's a friendly competition that keeps each project honest.

[22:59] <mugwump> besides, it's not about "need"; no-one dictated from high that anyone even implement perl 6 at all

[22:59] <TimToady> but they're all trying to converge on a common goal.

[22:59] <szbalint> bx420: in a way you're right. perl the interpreter/compiler is the Perl 5 design document. Perl 6's design documents are the Synopses

[22:59] <mugwump> there was no high to dictate from, really - without getting metaphysical

[23:00] <TimToady> the only thing I saw on high was flying mugs.  :)

[23:00] <QtPlatypus> @larry isn't on high?

[23:00] <lambdabot> Is that a hornpipe in yer pocket, or arr ya just happy ta see me?

[23:00] <szbalint> s/design document(s)?/specification/

[23:00] <mugwump> but what do you know, in the end three implementations are being built because people enjoy working on them

[23:01] <QtPlatypus> Because it scratches there an itch.

[23:02] <QtPlatypus> mugwump: pugs, parrot and ? (What is the third implementation)

[23:02] <mugwump> lrep.  oh, and I forgot MiniPerl

[23:02] * mugwump doesn't pick nits at parrot being called a perl6 implementation there

[23:03] <TimToady> hey, it already runs some of the sanity tests...

[23:03] *** marmic_ joined
[23:04] <mugwump> I mean, there's a perl6 implementation written using and distributed with parrot, but that's not parrot

[23:05] <TimToady> gotcha

[23:05] <QtPlatypus> mugwump: Point taken its like saying hascall is a perl6 implementation.

[23:05] <mugwump> or GNU as is a C compiler

[23:05] <szbalint> "hascall" very well could be. Not a bad name. :)

[23:06] *** weinig is now known as weinig|out

[23:07] <QtPlatypus> Excuse spelling, though it is a good name for soemthing else.

[23:11] *** penk joined
[23:15] <leo> bx420: IronPython was that one, and there's Stackless - a lot of implementations (all a bit different) for one language

[23:17] <TimToady> so another reason for developing all these things in parallel is to try to understand all these little differences in advance, and maybe even tweak the language design to minimize them, and test for conformance with a standard test suite.

[23:20] * ayrnieu still amused by Vyper -- an implementation of Python in O'Caml with IIRC a very silly license.  Why go to such obviously silly trouble to then get creative with your license?

[23:26] <bx420> there are people who wrote languages for the purpose of writing new languages

[23:26] <bx420> ANTLR

[23:39] <QtPlatypus> Why did python end up with so meany implementations when perl5 only ended up with 1 and a 1/2?

[23:40] <bx420> no idea

[23:48] <cognominal> with perl5, the implemantation is the specification

[23:53] <szbalint> Yes, maybe thats why.

[23:54] <cognominal> there is many way to code in Perl, but there is only one perl :)

[23:58] <mugwump> heh, there's semantic efficiency for you: the Chinese term for "opium eater" (ÁôÆÂêõÂ≠ê / y«ên j≈´n z«ê ) also means "chain smoker"
