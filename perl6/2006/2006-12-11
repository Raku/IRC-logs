[13:56] *** Roadrunner joined
[13:56] <Limbic_Region> I was thinking something along the lines of:  my $blind_mice; my $answer = $blind_mice * 14; $blind_mice = 3; say $answer;  # 42 of course

[13:58] <Roadrunner> Hello All!

[13:58] <Roadrunner> How to use "flock" system call inside perl script? I want to use it instead of "flock" perl wrapper.

[13:59] <wolverian> Roadrunner, you probably want #perl instead. this channel is for the development of the next version of perl.

[14:00] <kolibrie> Limbic_Region: audreyt's Scalar::Defer for Perl 5 says you can say: my $answer = lazy { $blind_mice * 14 };

[14:00] <kolibrie> but I don't know if anything is written for this in perl 6

[14:03] *** Roadrunner left
[14:06] <Limbic_Region> kolibrie - well, I am not even sure what I have seen of Lazy in Perl 6 is what I am thinking of

[14:08] <Limbic_Region> *shrug*

[14:19] <gaal> IIRC lists are the only things that are lazy by default in Perl 6. There will be a pair of keywords for lazy/defer as in the P5 module, but "defer" is already used in STM so I think Larry was looking (and had perhaps found) an alternative name for it.

[14:20] <Limbic_Region> gaal - I was wondering how something like my @array = lazy/defer %hash.keys; # would work

[14:21] <Limbic_Region> gaal - cause I could see multiple behaviors and more than one desireable

[14:23] <kolibrie> Limbic_Region: for lazy, every time @array is read, it looks at %hash to see the current keys

[14:24] <kolibrie> for defer, in looks at %hash the first time, but afterwards is static

[14:24] <gaal> kolibrie: if you're talking about the p5 module, it's the other way around :)

[14:24] <kolibrie> gaal: shucks

[14:25] * kolibrie remains silent most of the time for a reason

[14:25] <gaal> Limbic_Region: in your example, presumably it's %hash.keys that needs to be lazy here

[14:25] <Limbic_Region> kolibrie - those are the behaviors I would expect if @array were a scalar

[14:26] <gaal> kolibrie: you'd have spent the rest of your days being wrong about this if you had :)

[14:26] <kolibrie> gaal: I'll still probably explain it wrong from time to time

[14:26] <kolibrie> that's why I document everything I write, I'll forget how it works within days or weeks

[14:26] <gaal> that makes defer { $world_population } of us

[14:27] <kolibrie> of course, in Perl 6 you can probably bind @array := %hash.keys

[14:28] <Limbic_Region> so eliminating the case of assign once and static forever, what would you expect with @array[3];  # change %hash; @array[3]

[14:28] <gaal> you mean #( change hash )  :)

[14:28] <wolverian> should grammars have a "default" rule to call, a la .new in classes?

[14:28] <Limbic_Region> hrm, I am not explaining this quite right

[14:29] <kolibrie> gaal: #( less than one line comments are cool)

[14:30] <gaal> huh, the bottom symbol is a quarter-line comment symbol _|_

[14:30] <gaal> (for of those make up a #)

[14:30] <Limbic_Region> and as such I will shut up until I can explain it the way it is gently bouncing around my head

[14:31] <kolibrie> gaal: let's not propose that symbol for quarter-line comments

[14:32] <PerlJam> wolverian: when would the default be called?  What's the syntax to invoke a grammar (as opposed to a specfic rule within a grammar)?

[14:32] <kolibrie> Limbic_Region: if @array is bound to %hash.keys and you change %hash, @array will change with it

[14:32] <wolverian> PerlJam, <Foo> vs <Foo.rule>, I suppose.

[14:32] <PerlJam> kolibrie: It's the other way that's more interesting.

[14:33] <kolibrie> if you change @array, %hash will change too

[14:33] <PerlJam> wolverian: Then how does one differentiate between a call to a grammar and a call to a rule?

[14:33] <PerlJam> er, how would *perl* differentiate.

[14:33] <wolverian> PerlJam, ucfirst? ;)

[14:35] <kolibrie> wolverian: I don't think there is a default rule in a grammar.  But one rule can be set up as the main one that calls all the othes

[14:35] <kolibrie> others, even

[14:36] <PerlJam> wolverian: in the parrot compiler tools, the "default" rule (ala what kolibrie just said) is called "apply".

[14:36] <wolverian> kolibrie, right. I just kind of don't like that you don't know which one it is without reading the documentation.

[14:37] <kolibrie> MiniPerl6 has a 'parse' top-level rule, but uses 'comp_unit' right now

[14:37] <kolibrie> so it does not have to parse the whole input at once

[14:40] *** hexmode joined
[14:44] <stevan> Limbic_Region: I think hard part about what you are describing is that you are talking about lazy evaluation in a side-effectful context 

[14:45] <stevan> Limbic_Region: in haskell you have no side effects (like variable re-assignment), so it is a non-issue for them

[14:45] <Limbic_Region> stevan - yes, that is some of what I am thinking

[14:46] <Limbic_Region> stevan - but I guess I was also thinking that both sides of the assignment could be lazy too

[14:46] <stevan> yes

[14:47] <stevan> I think this would probably be completely unpredictable though

[14:47] <stevan> the beauty of haskell and its laziness is that they can be sure the value will always be the same

[14:47] <Limbic_Region> right

[14:47] <stevan> and just get around to evaluating it when they want to :)

[14:48] <Limbic_Region> and what about allows for default values if the thing you were going to lazily evaluate disapears before you get a chance to interogate it

[14:49] <Limbic_Region> or even better - spooky action at a distance - if the thing you were lazily basing your values on goes *poof*, it magically updates your value even if the user land code never asks it to

[16:01] <kolibrie> it is very similar to my Practical Extration with Perl 6 talk

[16:02] <kolibrie> I like the way MiniPerl6 is set up with a grammar on one side, an emitter on the other, and a glue script in the middle

[16:02] <fglock> kolibrie: yep

[16:03] <kolibrie> I am thinking of defining the object in the emitter, and then have a differet grammar for each type of documnt

[16:06] <kolibrie> I would like to add tests to v6.pm, or wherever is appropriate, so that I will know when things change and I have to make adjustments

[16:07] <kolibrie> fglock: would those go in Pugs::Compiler::Perl6, or Pugs::Compiler::Rule, or somewhere else?

[16:08] <fglock> the best place would be under pugs t/

[16:08] <kolibrie> okay

[16:09] <fglock> so that they can be tested under pugs and p6-parrot too

[16:09] <kolibrie> under regex, or under examples?

[16:12] <fglock> regex, I guess - it can be moved later

[16:12] <kolibrie> okay

[16:13] <fglock> and writing failing tests is a good thing too

[16:13] <kolibrie> that's true too, especially if it means they'll get fixed

[21:00] <wolverian> oh well. never mind me.

[21:04] <Juerd> wolverian: That's because of lag.

[21:04] <wolverian> Juerd, right. 

[21:04] <Juerd> With a split, it just gets quits from the server. With a join, it just gets joins from the server. Irssi recognises and groups these.

[21:04] <wolverian> I know how it happens, now that I actually thought about it. 

[21:04] <Juerd> But if there is a too large interval, it sees them as separate groups.

[21:04] <wolverian> I was just too lazy to do it before wondering aloud.

[21:05] <Juerd> For me, typing is harder than thinking :)

[21:05] <Juerd> You must be wired differently :)

[21:06] <wolverian> Juerd, oh, by the way. when opening a new shell (that is, bash) on feather, it takes about ten seconds to get bash loaded. ^C in the middle leaves me with a broken locale (or something; Ã¤Ã¶Ã¥ don't come through to me). any idea if I'm doing something wrong?

[21:39] <brundlefliege> hey guys i love shell scripting and wondered how a mundane task like e.g. for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do mkdir $i; done would be looking in perl on the command line?

[21:39] <brundlefliege> what is the benefit of using perl for sysadmin tasks (little automations?) in comparison to bash scripts?

[21:39] <Khisanth> perl -e 'mkdir $_ for 1..5;' :)

[21:41] <rgs> and $_ isn't required either with bleadperl

[21:43] <rgs> brundlefliege: actually you know that this channel is for perl 6, not for perl 5, right ?

[21:45] <Khisanth> then again there is the Shell module :)

[21:46] <brundlefliege> so you mean the really nice thing about perl is that you can write directories on the given filesystem with perl synatx?

[21:47] <brundlefliege> e.g. when you are on an os/2 system and you dont know which prebuilt shell-command is used for making a directory, right?

[21:48] <Khisanth> the really nice thing about perl is CPAN!

[21:48] <brundlefliege> but i am stopping and changing to #perl sorry for disturbing again :)

[21:48] <brundlefliege> cpan is the free source of perl scripts isnt it?

[21:49] <brundlefliege> python doesnt have something like that, does a place like cpan exist for mundane shell scripts in connection with system administration?
