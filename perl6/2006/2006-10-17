[00:00] <TreyHarris> TimToady: that precedence is really, really unintuitive in the extreme.

[00:00] <lanny> ?eval pick 33

[00:00] <evalbot_r14375> Error: pick not defined: VInt 33

[00:00] <TimToady> it's only off by one.  :)

[00:00] <lanny> ?eval pick (33)

[00:00] <evalbot_r14375> Error: pick not defined: VInt 33

[00:00] <lanny> oh, right

[00:00] <lanny> ?eval pick (33,)

[00:01] <evalbot_r14375> 33

[00:01] <lanny> ?eval pick (33,)..77

[00:01] <evalbot_r14375> 7

[00:01] <TreyHarris> i would expect range ops to bind very tight

[00:01] <lanny> :)

[00:01] <TimToady> they're non chaining because you can't do $a .. $b .. $c

[00:01] <lanny> There's your answer, TreyHarris.  7

[00:02] <jojo> ?eval pick (1..1e10)

[00:02] <evalbot_r14375> pugs: out of memory (requested 1048576 bytes)

[00:03] <TimToady> pugs isn't range object savvy yet...

[00:04] <TreyHarris> TimToady: it's a chaining issue, not a prec issue?  i mean, to me, .. "feels" like **... it should bind tightly enough to where i can treat a range as a single thing like i treat an exponentiated number as a single thing...

[00:04] <jojo> well, at least it gave a sensible error

[00:04] <TimToady> what should abs $a <=> abs $b give you?

[00:05] <TimToady> abs $a .. abs $b is the same

[00:05] <TimToady> if .. were as tight as ** you'd have to be saying ($a-1)..($b+1) all the time.

[00:06] <TreyHarris> i'd expect to do that, as otherwise i'd think i'd get $a - (1..$b) + 1, which is silly.

[00:06] <lanny> ?eval say pick (5,)..10

[00:06] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[3␤] Bool::True

[00:07] <TreyHarris> i need to ask audreyt what font she's using for IRC... there is no font installed on the Mac that has that NL character evalbot uses

[00:07] <TimToady> she just gets "NL" herself, is my understanding.

[00:08] <TreyHarris> (Macs let you search by codepoint for fonts with that character, so i know none of mine have it)

[00:08] <lanny> ?eval say 5..10

[00:08] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[5678910␤] Bool::True

[00:08] <lanny> Ok.  Why doesn't 'pick (5,)..10' give me 5..10?

[00:09] <TimToady> beats me

[00:09] <lanny> :)  A test!

[00:09] <TimToady> ?eval say (5,)..10

[00:09] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[12345678910␤] Bool::True

[00:09] <jojo> ?eval print 1

[00:09] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[1] Bool::True

[00:09] <TimToady> I'd say it's taking the length of (5,)

[00:10] <TreyHarris> lanny: (5,) in scalar context is... yes.  ==TimToady

[00:10] <jojo> ?eval say 1

[00:10] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[1␤] Bool::True

[00:10] <TreyHarris> so you're saying 1..10

[00:10] <lanny> But I'm pick-ing it.

[00:10] <TimToady> no you're not

[00:10] <lanny> ?eval say pick (5,)..10

[00:10] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[6␤] Bool::True

[00:10] <TimToady> ?eval say pick(5,)..10

[00:10] <evalbot_r14375> Error: pick not defined: VInt 5

[00:11] <lanny> aha.  Ok.  I see it now

[00:11] <TimToady> P6 is *very* picky about whitespace before postfixes.

[00:11] <lanny> I don't understand it.  But I see it.

[00:12] <lanny> ?eval say pick(33,)

[00:12] <evalbot_r14375> Error: pick not defined: VInt 33

[00:12] <jojo> is "say" perl6 or bot-specific?

[00:12] <lanny> ?eval say pick (33,)

[00:12] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[33␤] Bool::True

[00:13] <TreyHarris> is there a POE irc channel?  i've gummed up this app with debug logging, and I *know* my event generator's getting called several times, but while my event handler gets called the right *number* of times, it's getting the first set of data each time...

[00:14] <TimToady> pick with whitespace is always a list operator.

[00:14] <lanny> It surprised me that pick (33,) gives 33 but pick (33,)..77 really gives pick (1..77) after the conversation you and TreyHarris were having on ..

[00:15] <lanny> I see why now.

[00:15] <lanny> ?eval pick (pick (33,))..77

[00:15] <evalbot_r14375> 72

[00:15] <lanny> tada

[00:17] <lambdabot> Title: Official Perl 6 Documentation

[00:21] <jojo> thanks lanny . i see say all over it. i don't immediately find the justification

[00:21] <jojo> but i will never object to taking two letters off print

[00:21] <jojo> is $\ obsolete?

[00:23] <TimToady> jojo, yes.

[00:24] <TimToady> that sort of thing should now be done by the filehandles.

[00:24] <TimToady> infact, default input filehandle autochomps now.

[00:25] <jojo> arguably, that would always have been correct

[00:25] *** nekokak joined
[00:25] <TimToady> wouldn't have worked in earlier Perl

[00:26] <TimToady> because an empty newline would have been false.

[00:26] <TimToady> now that we use for instead of while, it works much better.

[00:26] <TimToady> but for "for" to work well, lists had to become lazy.

[00:26] <jojo> good point.  i always use defined ($line = <>)

[00:27] <jojo> actually, does perl5 -ln have the same problem?

[00:29] <TimToady> no, because perl 5 hacks in a hidden defined() for you.

[00:29] <TimToady> but it's a kludge

[00:29] <TimToady> while in p6 is not special that way.

[00:31] <jojo> that is nasty, especially since p5 man perlrun shows the loop without defined

[00:31] <TimToady> there are many, many nasty things in p5...

[00:31] <jojo> and p5 man version of the loop is correct in terms of braces and that nasty golf hack

[00:34] <pasteling> "bsb" at 203.214.67.82 pasted "more $_ defaulting prints and says" (14 lines, 350B) at http://sial.org/pbot/20496

[00:36] <TimToady> the S04 example is not actually incorrect.

[00:36] <TimToady> (it's using a feed ==> to supply print's arguments)

[00:38] <bsb> I wasn't sure about that one

[00:39] <bsb> I still mistakenly think of ==> like a map sometimes

[00:40] <bsb> maybe that's not completely wrong from a certain angle...

[02:55] <lambdabot> Title: Sage: A Programming Language with Hybrid Type-Checking

[03:00] <lanny> Very odd.  My win32 pugs build runs fine except if I just type ./pugs when it hangs and never gives output of any kind.

[03:00] <audreyt> surely you mean .\pugs ?

[03:00] <lambdabot> audreyt: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[03:01] <audreyt> lanny: please fix Pugs::Doc::Hack and commit

[03:01] <audreyt> ho hum. not sure what's going on

[03:01] <lanny> audreyt: gladly. where do I find it?  (or I would have)

[03:01] <audreyt> docs/Pugs/Doc/Hack.pod

[03:01] <lanny> Ok.  Do I feel silly.  I figured that was .hs documentation.

[03:02] <audreyt> :)

[03:03] <lanny> Ok.  Someone's already fixed it.  But CPAN still has it as Bundle::Pugs::Hack and pugscode.org points to that

[03:03] <audreyt> that's okay today CPAN will be populated with a new pugs

[03:05] <lanny> Also I found a workaround to nmake1.5.  I hand-edited the Makefile and removed the Makefile run of docs/perl6.  Been trying to tracedown how to break up the size of the stanza in docs/perl6/Makefile but ExtUtils::MakeMaker is scary

[03:06] <audreyt> yeah, you can maybe write a Makefile postprocessor?

[03:06] <audreyt> I'd like to see that fixed

[03:07] <lanny> I'm pretty sure I could hack up a postprocessor.  Was hoping to do it correctly but will get it working and then will get it right.

[03:07] <audreyt> first get it working and then refactor

[03:08] <audreyt> in that order :)

[03:56] <audreyt> I try :)

[03:56] <audreyt> I'd rather hack Perl/Haskell, even C, than English , though...

[03:56] * audreyt hacks English in ChangeLog some more

[03:56] <gnuvince> I can imagine.

[03:56] <gnuvince> Although the medium is not terribly interesting.

[03:57] <gnuvince> I mean, a ChangeLog?  It's more fun to write a release message

[03:58] <audreyt> that I already did, in a sketch form, on the journal

[03:58] <gnuvince> Yeah, read that.

[04:04] <TreyHarris> audreyt: if you'll be finished during my waketime (+3 hours from nowish) I'll be happy to hack the English if you just outline your thoughts in your commit...

[04:07] <TreyHarris> audreyt: though i just realized you're probably speaking more metaphorically as "hack the english" meaning figuring out your thoughts, the medium being English.  (around here when people say "hack english" they usually mean deal with grammar/spelling/writing style/etc.)

[04:29] <audreyt> lambdabot: how's the Makefile hacking doing?

[04:30] <TreyHarris> that's a smart bot!

[04:30] <TreyHarris> lambdabot does Makefile haking?

[04:30] <audreyt> it's meant to be "lanny"...

[04:32] <audreyt> lunch, bbiab. I'll hack in "mtl" detection

[04:32] <audreyt> other than that I think pre2 is in order

[04:32] <audreyt> and then release

[04:32] <TimToady> I note that runpugs says the server isn't running.  is that because it's currently recompiling?

[04:35] <audreyt> I have no idea...

[04:35] <audreyt> @tell andara: does webterminal server actually spawn children? it doesn't look like it

[04:35] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[04:36] <audreyt> TimToady: recompilation produces ./pugs.new

[04:43] <TreyHarris> question: "POD".  Damian used "Pod", which I assumed meant that he was distinguishing Perl 5's POD from Perl 6's Pod.  Was I incorrectly reading semantics into an orthographic error?

[04:46] <TimToady> I think you're seeing a de-emphasis of the acronym.  Maybe it's a new shibboleth.  :)

[04:46] <TreyHarris> TimToady: I pronounce that "sibboleth"

[04:52] <TimToady> probably did

[04:53] <evalbot_r14383> (no output)

[04:54] <TreyHarris> is that catchable?  should be... i noticed the changelog said, "Circular mixin is no longer allowed" and was wondering if that meant support had been dropped or if it actually caught that

[04:54] *** baest joined
[04:55] <TimToady> maybe it means run-time mixin, not role composition?

[04:56] <TreyHarris> ah, perhaps.  i don't know how to write a test for "doesn't go into an infinite loop" though.  Paging Drs. Turing and Godel, code blue....

[04:57] <dduncan> I have a quick Perl 5 question ... does a weak reference pointing to an object become undefined before or after that object's DESTROY() method is called?

[04:58] <TreyHarris> dduncan: try it and see?  i'd think it would have to be "before", but it would be easy to try

[04:58] <dduncan> yes, but I thought it might be faster to ask someone

[04:58] <dduncan> no matter

[04:58] <TimToady> might be wronger too.  :)

[05:07] <svnbot6> r14386 | trey++ | in the new Changelog and IE spellings seems slightly more common in

[05:07] <svnbot6> r14386 | trey++ | text so far than American English.

[05:07] <TreyHarris> yes, the past two logs have been tongue-in-cheek....

[05:09] <TimToady> what's this International English crap?

[05:10] <TreyHarris> TimToady: i can switch it all to American English easily enough if you'd like.  There were slightly more "-ise" than "-ize" in the changelog thus far, so I just made the rest match

[05:10] <TimToady> you can spell it however you like, just don't call it international unless all nations agree on it. :)

[05:23] <TreyHarris> hmm, re "Typed constraints on autovivification":  why shouldn't this:

[05:24] *** evalbot_r14383 is now known as evalbot_r14387

[05:24] <evalbot_r14387> Error: Can't modify constant item: VUndef

[05:24] <TreyHarris> cause $x to turn into a Capture?

[05:24] <TreyHarris> (not thinking that it *should*, just wondering why not)

[05:28] <TimToady> it would be possible to make it work that way.  I suppose the question is how often such a thing would indicate an error rather than an intention.

[05:29] <TimToady> if it's likely to be an error, then perhaps the intention should be more cleary expressed via some declaration before letting it autocapturize

[05:29] <TreyHarris> yes, that's a good answer.  i just wanted to know what to say to the question i'm sure will come up from a student at some point :)

[05:29] <TimToady> it's a good waffle.  I don't know if it's a good answer.  :)

[05:30] <TreyHarris> oh-hoh!

[05:30] <TreyHarris> ?eval my $x; $x<moose> = "foo"; $x[0]

[05:30] *** evalbot_r14387 is now known as evalbot_r14388

[05:30] <evalbot_r14388> ("moose" => "foo")

[05:30] <TreyHarris> I didn't know you could do that

[05:31] <audreyt> this is "everything autoflatten to 1-seq"

[05:31] <svnbot6> r14389 | audreyt++ | * Makefile.PL: Detect the case of missing mtl library caused

[05:31] <svnbot6> r14389 | audreyt++ |   by installing only the core GHC-6.6 libraries, instead of extra-lib.

[05:31] <audreyt> which may or may not be correct

[05:31] <audreyt> this is because $x[0] is counterpart to both perl5's

[05:32] <audreyt> ($x)[0]

[05:32] <audreyt> and

[05:32] <audreyt> ($x)->[0]

[05:33] <audreyt> fwiw, the 1[0] == 1 behaviour agrees with rub

[05:33] <TimToady> seems to that at one point I was considering that the first has to be written [$x][0]

[05:33] <audreyt> namely that 1.to_a there is [1]

[05:33] <audreyt> instead of an error

[05:34] <audreyt> spec is unclear about this

[05:37] <TimToady> I guess the question is whether that would mask a significant number of programming mistakes.

[05:37] <audreyt> the same can be asked about list-context autoflattening...

[05:40] <audreyt> this is hash-flattens-to-list-of-pairs

[05:40] <TimToady> yes, and I wonder how long till people start depending on the hash ordering.  :)

[05:41] <audreyt> it's unordered :)

[05:41] <TreyHarris> well, it will make algorithms where once you see something you can take anything you've seen before except the one you're looking at now easier... but I don't know how many such algorithms there are... :D

[05:41] <audreyt> pugs> {9 => 2, 3 => 4}[0]

[05:41] <audreyt> ("3", 4)

[05:42] <TimToady> why isn't that a pair?

[05:42] <audreyt> pugs> WHAT {9 => 2, 3 => 4}[0]

[05:42] <audreyt> ::Pair

[05:42] <audreyt> just bad prettyprinting notation.

[05:43] <TimToady> Bad prettyprinter!!  Prettyprinter no cookie!!!

[05:43] <audreyt> oy

[05:43] <TimToady> ah well, we can fix it in Perl 7...

[05:55] <Alias_> audreyt, are you ok if I spam various mongers groups here about sponsoring you over here?

[05:56] <audreyt> I'd be honoured

[05:56] <Alias_> righto

[05:56] <Alias_> mugwump is spamming NZ too, about getting you an AU and NZ ticket

[05:56] <audreyt> indeed without sponsorship of ticket/accomodation I prolly can't get there myself

[05:57] <audreyt> ooh NZ will rock.

[05:57] <Alias_> I can offer floorspace in Sydney, with air beds now

[05:57] <Alias_> So I figure that's covered

[05:57] <mugwump> er, 'spamming' isn't quite right, it will be more of an internal discussion here... as the Wellington.pm leader works here

[06:09] <audreyt> good moose

[06:20] <audreyt> TreyHarris:

[06:21] <audreyt> similar to Perl 5's `goto &sub`

[06:21] <audreyt> it's not really similar

[06:21] <audreyt> as .call returns

[09:19] <audreyt> you can include XXX in inc/

[09:19] <audreyt> it will get used by tests

[09:21] <ingy> and svn

[09:24] <ingy> audreyt: I was thinking that .pxc should be used for P6 stuff by convention, and .pm generation could be used mre for P5 stuff. but it's not hard and fast by any means

[09:25] <ingy> there are just some modules where using .pmc is going to piss people off, and using .pm is not.

[12:26] <Limbic_Region> Dan Golden apparently

[12:27] <audreyt> kolibrie: sure, a 6.4.2 testflight on pre2 will be useful

[12:34] <fglock> what is the signature for a subroutine without an argument list? sub {...} - I'm wondering if it depends on the context, eg. inside a map()

[12:34] <audreyt> no

[12:34] <audreyt> it's always *@_

[12:35] <audreyt> a bare block however is :($_ is rw)

[12:35] <fglock> does it slurp the entire mapped list?

[12:35] <fglock> ok

[12:35] <audreyt> but implicit params $^a etc changes that

[12:36] <fglock> so sub{...} would slurp the map() list

[12:36] *** HiTech69 joined
[12:36] <audreyt> that depends on how map dispatches

[12:36] <audreyt> currently pugs's &map asks for mandatory arity

[12:37] <audreyt> and use that (min 1) for looping

[12:37] <audreyt> so sub{} still only gets one per run

[12:37] <kolibrie> audreyt: pre2 compiles to something that runs on linux ghc 6.4.2

[12:38] <fglock> right - so the decision is left to map() implementation

[12:38] <audreyt> yup

[13:09] <audreyt> Limbic_Region: I don't know :) likely during my stay at Brazil, may be sooner if gaal feels like it

[13:09] <audreyt> so in 3 weeks or so?

[13:09] <rafl> Are there any known issues on Debian with ghc 6.6? I just upgraded from 6.4 and the release doesn't build anymore because of a missing package: mtl.

[13:10] <audreyt> rafl: you need extralibs

[13:10] <audreyt> not sure if it's separately packaged iwth debian or not

[13:10] <audreyt> the linux bindist includes both

[16:26] <Juerd> Thank you

[16:26] <Juerd> What, er, is a cowdancer?

[16:28] <rafl> Juerd: A weird Copy-on-write directory tree utility. Used by cowbuilder, which is something like pbuilder, but it uses COW directories instead of a huge base tarball which needs to be unpacked every time.

[16:29] <rafl> Juerd: Also, you don't want to upgrade to ghc6 (6.6) in sid. It doesn't include the extralibs stuff yet, so you won't be able to build pugs as it needs mtl (and probably more) from extralibs.

[16:31] <rafl> Oh, there's another ghc installation in /usr/local. Don't mind then..

[17:42] <Limbic_Region> and apparently there isn't a factoid for further info

[17:42] <TimToady> andara's connection has been flapping in the breeze.

[17:43] <Captain_Fourier> well I see there is source code for runpugs

[17:43] <Captain_Fourier> hmm lets see what I can do

[17:43] <TimToady> there is, but of course by the time you set it up to run yourself you can just run pugs in a regular terminal.  :)

[17:44] <TimToady> might be worth having a bevy of runpugses scattered around the world though.

[17:44] <Captain_Fourier> i have run pugs in terminal

[19:55] <[particle]> @tell lanny i think it's a subversion 1.4.0 problem... is that the version you're running?

[20:33] <lanny> [particle]: Yes that is the subversion I'm using.  Do you know if svk will fix it?  I have that on my box but didn't want to set up a mirror and the push/pull.

[20:33] <lambdabot> lanny: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[20:33] <lanny> @messages

[20:33] <lambdabot> [particle] said 38m 3s ago: i think it's a subversion 1.4.0 problem... is that the version you're running?

[20:34] <clkao> lanny: ?

[20:34] <[particle]> i dont use svk, so i don't know

[20:34] <[particle]> clkao: can't get pugs revision info with svn 1.4.0

[20:34] <lanny> I think he was gawking at my fear of push/pull.  :)

[20:35] <[particle]> it could be a problem with the perl code that parses it, i suppose

[20:36] <lanny> Now 'svn info' shows 14408 as expected so I don't know why Pugs can't figure it out

[20:40] <[particle]> ok, the problem is that pugs scans for .svn/entries, and the working copy format changed for 1.4.0

[20:40] <lanny> [particle]++

[20:41] <[particle]> i guess instead it should run C<svn --version> and parse output

[20:41] <SamB> ReactOS had the same problem...

[20:41] <[particle]> i don't have an older svn version to test with, only 1.4.0

[20:41] <SamB> if you do that it should work fine with older versions...

[20:42] <lanny> [particle]: That would be saner

[20:42] <svnbot6> r14409 | fglock++ | v6/emitter(2) - range elements are Typed

[20:43] <[particle]> well, i don't know if the svn --version output is a different format

[20:43] <SamB> the people on #svn gave me the impression it would be fine

[20:43] <SamB> and that only the internal files you weren't supposed to be reading anyway had changed format

[20:43] <lanny> Well it should probably use 'svn info' to figure out the revision

[20:44] <SamB> well, whatever "svn foo" it is, that is

[20:44] <[particle]> right, duh, info, not --version

[20:45] <SamB> should work fine ;-)

[20:45] <lanny> looks like info is 'key: value' and I doubt that would change soon

[20:46] <SamB> they definately gave me the impression that it had not changed recently and was not going to change anytime soon, either ;-)

[20:46] <lanny> Bah.  Developers.  Can't trust em like that.  They'll bite you ever time!

[20:46] * [particle] updates his pugs working copy

[20:48] <SamB> well, another option would be to call the SVN API...

[20:48] <lanny> Too funny.  The code is there in util/version_h.pl to read from 'svn info' but it prefers to read from $base/.svn/entries.

[20:48] <[particle]> samb: does that require any client modulesL

[20:48] <[particle]> ?

[20:48] <SamB> lanny: and it doesn't deal with the unreadability thereof?

[20:49] <[particle]> well, it'll read svk info, but not svn

[20:49] <SamB> you need the SVN library...

[20:49] *** fglock left
[20:49] <lanny> Working it.  It looks like if it can read .svn/entries that is preferred  'elsif ( -r $svn_entries ) { ...'

[20:49] <SamB> which the "svn" command needs too

[20:49] <SamB> it should also check if it can *parse* that

[20:49] <lanny> oh.  Good catch, [particle].  I'm starting to see what I want instead of what is there.

[23:49] <TimToady> or as in svn kind of "what"?

[23:50] <TimToady> and some of us are girls.

[23:50] <Alias_> I was using the royal "you guys"

[23:50] <Alias_> But yes, I was refering to openfoundry

[23:54] <TimToady> you are, in fact, an admin on the project.  :)

[23:55] <avar> TimToady: Whatever the final "official" Perl 6 parser will be please make it as open a project as pugs:)

[23:55] <Alias_> TimToady, apparently Audrey was even more generous handing out the bits in the early days of the project :)

[23:56] <avar> Alias_: I have a commit bit because I joined the channel one day and said hi or something:)

[23:56] <TimToady> there is no "official" parser, only the official test suite.  the first parser that passes the test suite is likely to come from the pugs project.

[23:57] <Alias_> avar: I have an admin bit because I donated some Perl 5 modules for conversion to Perl 6 some times back in the dark mist of the first few months

[23:57] <Alias_> (apparently)

[23:57] <TimToady> you're an admin because we've met you and Know Who You Are in case you misbehave...

[23:58] <Alias_> true :)

[23:58] <Alias_> TimToady, whatever this thing is that gets released for the current Christmas, are you planning on actually slapping some sort of "Perl 6 alpha" or "Perl 6 developer preview" on it?

[23:58] <Alias_> (please add all the usual caveats to that question

[23:58] <Alias_> (

[23:58] <Alias_> )

[23:59] <TimToady> you can already say "use v6-alpha;" in your P5 code.  :)
