[02:39] <stevan_> heya ingy

[02:52] <ingy> hi stevan_ 

[02:53] <ingy> stevan_: I just ported tt2 to js

[02:53] <stevan_> tt2? Template Toolkit??

[02:53] <ingy> yeah

[02:53] <stevan_> thats cool,.. totally nuts,.. but cool :)

[02:53] <ingy> Jemplate

[02:54] <stevan_> is this for Kwiki?

[02:54] <ingy> no it's totally sane

[02:54] <ingy> it uses tt's parser

[02:54] <ingy> with a JS backend

[02:54] <stevan_> Ajax?

[02:54] <ingy> nope

[02:55] * stevan_ is confused

[02:55] <ingy> you compile all your TT2 templates into a single foo.js

[02:55] <ingy> and then there is a small Jemplate.js

[02:55] <stevan_> oh

[02:55] <ingy> EOS

[02:55] <stevan_> that is insane

[02:55] <ingy> QED

[02:55] <ingy> etc

[02:55] <ingy> insane but simple

[02:56] <stevan_> so how does it get displayed?

[02:56] <stevan_> does the browser handle it all?

[02:57] <ingy> =head1 SYNOPSIS

[02:57] <ingy> var data = fetchSomeJsonResult(); var elem = document.getElementById('some-div'); elem.innerHTML = Jemplate.process('my-template.html', data);

[02:57] <ingy> hmm, that messed up

[02:58] <ingy> http://rafb.net/paste/results/Qcy1mR77.txt

[02:58] <stevan_> that is completely insane :)

[02:59] <stevan_> totally cool,.. but totally nuts :)

[02:59] <ingy> thanks

[12:16] <lypie> Juerd: nor i

[12:16] <wolverian> what the heck is lenient evaluation?

[12:18] <azuroth> or to clarify, it's almost perl and ruby's mutually recursive baby

[12:24] <Juerd> Huh?

[12:24] <Juerd> No. Perl and Ruby rock, Python sucks. There can't be a connection, especially not a natural one.

[12:24] <theorbtwo> That was supposed to be /clearer/?

[12:25] <azuroth> :-)

[12:25] <Aankhen``> I detest forced whitespace, but I like pretty much everything else (that I've seen) of Python.

[12:25] <azuroth> what's so bad about python?

[12:27] <azuroth> I haven't done much, and what I've seen does suck in comparison, but when it's C++ or python, I'm willing to give it a shot

[12:28] * lypie would prefer c++ honestly

[12:28] <lypie> Aankhen``: yeah. its the forced whitespace that made me in the 1.5.1 give the **** up on the langage

[14:17] <wolverian> evening

[14:18] <audreyt> sorry I was away... $job, cyclic dependencies in visa application (had to choose betwen .il and .de/.at but not both)

[14:18] <audreyt> and fighting with mainstream media

[14:18] <audreyt> to try to not get misrepresented

[14:18] <wolverian> no reason to be sorry, it's your life :) 

[14:18] <audreyt> but I'm not enjoying this ;)

[14:18] <wolverian> right.. :) I'm sorry it's been hard for you

[14:18] <audreyt> so it's like, I feel sorry for myself :p

[14:18] <wolverian> what media?

[14:18] <audreyt> some random newspaper

[14:18] <audreyt> pretty major one though

[14:19] <wolverian> what country?

[14:19] <audreyt> .tw, my native country

[14:19] <wolverian> right. well, media sucks, in general :)

[14:19] <audreyt> indeed :)

[14:20] <wolverian> random observation: when using the mouse with your other hand, the cursor seems to be the wrong way around 

[14:20] <audreyt> indeed

[14:20] <webmind> wolverian, intresting :)

[14:21] <audreyt> gaal: .il denied me multi entry, citing that I didn't have the .de visa

[14:21] <wolverian> I absolutely adore nipple mice though - it's easy to use even with my left hand.

[14:21] <wolverian> (s/nipple/clit/, maybe)

[14:21] <audreyt> gaal: and .de wouldn't grant me visa without a visa in my midpoint country, .il

[14:21] <wolverian> ouch

[14:21] <audreyt> isn't bootstrapping fun :)

[14:21] <webmind> wolverian, can't say I have that problem.. but it might be that I don't use both my eyes at the same time

[14:25] <Juerd> wolverian: Feel free to call them "G spots"

[14:26] <Juerd> wolverian: Though I don't know if that's related to the QWERTY configuration's G location, or to some other thing :)

[14:37] <xinming> gaal: No, It won't, hmm, at least, It won't handle the Chinese utf-8 character correctly.

[14:38] <xinming> wolverian: No, I mean Chinese character. Today, I try to slurp a text file, It goes unreadable.

[14:49] <audreyt> xinming: hmm, utf8 in source file should be fine

[18:58] <Limbic_Region> a little girl, Jasmine, 

[18:58] <Limbic_Region> unfortunately, I used perlmonk.org (which has been done for some time now) to host my web page

[18:58] <Limbic_Region> my family is a thousand miles away and my wife's is even further

[21:41] <nothingmuch> i hope it's not too yucky

[21:42] * nothingmuch expects to get some bad feedback for it

[21:42] <obra> It's a little unclear how much you mean "pugs" when you say "perl6"

[21:42] <obra> and how much you mean "parrot, ponie and pge"

[21:42] <nothingmuch> i discuss pugs later

[21:42] <integral> oh, I said that kind of stuff once here, no one seemed interested *sigh* 

[21:42] <nothingmuch> parrot is less

[21:42] <nothingmuch> but still in there

[21:43] <nothingmuch> pge is part of the "making it faster"

[21:43] <nothingmuch> we are at "making it work"

[21:43] <nothingmuch> i think we need "making it work right"

[21:43] <nothingmuch> and then "making it faster"

[21:43] <integral> hmm, some of your pugs comments are about the direction pugs is moving anyway with PIR and layers

[21:43] <nothingmuch> as I see it "making it work right" is difficult to achieve if we don't concentrate specifics

[21:43] <nothingmuch> integral: ofcourse

[21:43] <obra> Well, there are basically two parallel implementations. Parrot/PGE and "Pugs which embraces everything"

[21:44] <nothingmuch> it's noting new

[21:44] <integral> it's just that you don't make clear that pugs is already doing this

[21:44] <nothingmuch> obra: pugs is a testbed, as I see it

[21:44] <nothingmuch> and a bootstrapping tool

[21:44] <nothingmuch> and everything at the moment

[21:44] <nothingmuch> parrot and pge are IMHO too low level to be useful right now

[21:44] <nothingmuch> but it's good that they're being developed because they save time later

[21:45] <nothingmuch> anyway, please read fully

[21:45] <nothingmuch> i think i touch on most of these issues in a way

[21:45] * integral doesn't think much will come of it

[21:46] <nothingmuch> i think the most crucial parts are much lower though

[21:46] <nothingmuch> in that Perl 6 is just too big to get it all done

[21:46] <integral> I predict that someone will point out that pmichaud is already taking submissions to update the synopses as things get decided,  and there will be a big argument about how to split it into layers

[21:46] <dduncan> nothingmuch, I just saw your p6l post

[21:46] <kolibrie> nothingmuch: no, I'm taking my family to the Netherlands in March, so that uses up all vacation time and 'extra' money

[22:45] <dduncan> question ...

[22:45] <dduncan> in Perl 5, the use of back-tick string delimiters indicated a system command to run

[22:46] <dduncan> in Perl 6, I don't think this exists anymore

[22:46] <dduncan> are back-ticks currently used for anything in Perl 6?

[22:46] <obra> Does larry say it doesn't exist in perl6 explicitly?

[22:46] <obra> Because if not, it does

[22:46] <dduncan> I meant, does a back-tick delimited string have any special meaning right now?

[22:47] <dduncan> I'm not aware of that being the case, but thought I would check

[22:48] <dduncan> I thought that invoking the shell like that was something excised from the core language like formats and put in a module instead

[23:36] *** evalbot_8954 is now known as evalbot_8956

[23:36] <evalbot_8956> Error:  unexpected ":" expecting "$!" 

[23:38] <dduncan> ?eval my $foo = 3; say $::<foo>;

[23:38] <evalbot_8956> Error:  unexpected "$" expecting block construct, ":", "(", "!", "/", "^", "*", "?", ".", "+", ";", word character, term postfix, operator, postfix conditional, postfix loop, postfix iteration or end of input 

[23:38] <dduncan> hmm, this still needs implementing, it seems

[23:39] <dduncan> I'll see if a test exists ...
