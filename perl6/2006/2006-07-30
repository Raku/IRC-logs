[02:27] <audreyt> dolmans: because having two places to put params is considered confusing

[02:28] <audreyt> sub ($x) { say $x + $^y }

[02:28] <audreyt> also, with sort blocks, why would you want a "sub" there?

[02:29] <dolmans> audreyt: just test the language syntax.

[02:31] <audreyt> *nod*

[02:41] <dolmans> audreyt: i wonder whether perl6/pugs would provide a high order function transformer module, flip, curry or some jargons that i don't even knows? or there already has one?

[02:43] <audreyt> there's ext/fp/

[02:43] <audreyt> but it can use some more helper functions

[02:43] <audreyt> there's a builtin curry in the form of .assuming

[02:44] <dolmans> ah, that is, sounds a good job

[06:14] * gaal streteches

[06:14] <agentzh> S05 says "Just as rx has variants, so does the C<regex> declarator. In particular, there are two special variants for use in grammar: C<token> and C<rule>."

[06:15] <agentzh> the first sentence seems odd

[06:15] <agentzh> "just as ... so does ..." doesn't it look very strange?

[06:16] <agentzh> gaal: moose }:=>

[06:16] <gaal> agentzh: elk!

[06:16] <gaal> it sounds OK to me

[06:17] <agentzh> gaal: okay. another question...

[06:17] <agentzh> what variants does C<rx> have?

[06:17] <agentzh> does S05 mean the variants like "rx /.../" and "rx (...)" ?

[06:18] <gaal> m// ?

[06:18] <agentzh> or S05 is saying C<rx> and C<regex> share the same set of "variants"?

[06:19] <agentzh> gaal: Hmm, it's likely

[06:19] <gaal> audreyt: in S05: "As the syntax indicates, it is now more closely analogous to a C<sub {...}>

[06:19] <gaal> constructor.  In fact, that analogy will run I<very> deep in Perl 6.

[06:19] <gaal> "

[06:19] <gaal> s/will run/runs/

[06:19] <agentzh> anyway it's a bit fuzzy here

[06:20] <gaal> also, inconsistent whitespace in line 1031

[06:21] <gaal> brb

[06:22] <agentzh> gaal: i don't think the whitespace is inconsistent on line 1031

[06:23] <gaal> the indentation is greater than in the line before it

[06:23] <agentzh> i think the auther is aligning the delimiters with line 1030.

[06:23] <agentzh> because the auther is talking about "the opening delimiter" on line 1028

[06:23] <gaal> sure, that's usually done w/o changing the first character unless it's a continuation line

[06:24] <gaal> I'd say the same about 1014

[06:24] *** penk joined
[06:24] <gaal> that is I'd prefer

[06:24] <agentzh> gaal: :)

[06:24] <gaal> rx    /.../

[06:24] <gaal> ro

[06:24] <gaal>     rx /.../

[06:25] <gaal> (*to)

[06:25] <agentzh> gaal: i agree

[06:26] <agentzh> intervening whitespace between rx and the delimiters are more appropriate.

[06:26] <agentzh> *is

[06:26] <agentzh> i'll add that to my patch for S05. :)

[06:27] <gaal> to make it more pleasing on the eye one trick is to exaggerate the spaces even in the regex    {...} case

[06:28] <gaal> so the visual difference between regex and rx doesn't stand out. but that's a very pale shade of bikeshed

[06:28] <gaal> "shady"

[08:39] <tessier> That can't be a good thing can it?

[08:40] <agentzh> english is also *huge*
