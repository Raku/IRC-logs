[00:05] <obra> 'evening

[00:05] <markstos> Hello Jesse

[00:07] *** jferrero joined
[00:08] <markstos> I backlogged. TimToady, you said " I expect that specs to get filled out with P5ish carryovers as the entire P5 test suite (core parts, at least) are ported over to P6, and people notice there's no place to L<> to, and do some cagecleaning on the specs."

[00:08] <markstos> regarding that,

[00:08] <markstos> should the process remain the same for that phase--- emailing feedback to p6l ?

[00:09] <markstos> Or would it be worthwhile to start a grassroots S16 based on how P5 works, and then work through @Larry to get it blessed ?

[00:09] <markstos> A lot of stuff in there is like 'chown' and 'unlink'... boring stuff I wouldn't expect to change much

[00:09] <markstos> or be the focus of much controversy.

[00:10] <markstos> As I've found, a few parts of it are already implemented, based on the P5 spec, I guess.

[00:12] <obra> are chown and unlink going to actually be core primitives in p6?

[00:13] <markstos> Jesse, I was just looking at the list under S12, found here:

[00:14] <markstos> (clipboard trouble. one moment. )

[00:14] <lambdabot> Title: S29, http://tinyurl.com/zsx4l

[00:15] <markstos> I don't really have an opinion one way or the other. I've just being trying to connect tests with specs.

[00:15] <markstos> If S16 started to exist, it would clear that up.

[00:15] <svnbot6> r13250 | audreyt++ | * Change Pugs.Val.Code.Param.p_variable from ID to Var

[00:15] <svnbot6> r13250 | audreyt++ |   so that my p6l reply to gaal++ would actually make sense. :-)

[00:15] <svnbot6> r13250 | audreyt++ |   Also unify the Var type from both oldLand and newLand;

[00:15] <svnbot6> r13250 | audreyt++ |   augmentation of Var should take place in Pugs.Types.

[00:16] <markstos> Anybody know where this is spec'ed?

[00:18] <audreyt> but not really. "it works as in perl5"

[00:19] <clkao> audreyt: morning!

[00:19] <markstos> thanks audreyt: reviewing now.

[00:20] <audreyt> greetings

[00:20] <markstos> audreyt: how can #perl6 team be most helpful to prepare for the upcoming release?

[00:20] <audreyt> markstos: look at failing tests; determine if the tests has been typo'ed or otherwise bogus

[00:20] <audreyt> that, and changelogging :)

[00:21] <markstos> audreyt: Is the best source for failing tests, smoke.pugscode.org ?

[00:21] <audreyt> right, or your local smoke.html

[00:21] <markstos> And should all failing tests be marked as :todo<something> right now ?

[00:21] <markstos> if they are legit failures?

[00:21] <audreyt> if they are legit regressions

[00:22] <audreyt> (you can tell by the failures occuring at the end of tests)

[00:22] <audreyt> then leave as failing

[00:22] <audreyt> s/at the end/_not_ at the end/

[00:22] <audreyt> if they are newly added

[00:22] <markstos> So anything at the worked for the last release, should work for this release, too. :)

[00:22] <audreyt> then yes, :todo<feature> as needed

[00:22] <audreyt> yes. that's the rule we've been oeprating under

[00:22] <markstos> Got it.

[00:22] <audreyt> "no regressions, but plenty of todos"

[00:23] <markstos> And is the rumor true that you have a big OO commit once the release is out?

[00:23] <clkao> iirc there was somehting about backend-spcific todos

[00:23] <audreyt> markstos: integrating nothingmuch's work, yes.

[00:24] <audreyt> still not clear if we should two it over two passees

[00:24] <audreyt> one for 6.4-compat bits

[00:24] <markstos> I'll see about writing something up that explains the status and makes it easier for people to help with the release prep.

[00:24] <audreyt> and one when 6.6 bindist comes out

[00:24] <markstos> speed!

[00:24] <audreyt> or just go for 6.6.

[00:24] <clkao> is it christmas yet?

[00:24] <obra> agentzh: you wanted to know when jifty came out next.

[00:24] <obra> "now"

[00:24] <obra> clkao: yes!

[00:24] <audreyt> I guess that depends on whether Simon & Simon actually releases 6.6 in ICFP :)

[00:24] <obra> I've made you a gifty, cl

[00:25] <clkao> that's for my birthday, and it's late!

[00:25] <audreyt> *groan*

[00:25] <obra> how about I make hotsprings exist in the UK?

[00:26] <TimToady> I don't know of anyone who would mind if S16 leapt up out of the quantum foam.

[00:26] <audreyt> interprocess communication?

[00:26] <audreyt> that'd be cool

[00:26] <clkao> ;)

[00:26] <obra> clkao: how about I get simon cozens to hack on Perl 6 again?

[00:26] <clkao> hehe

[00:27] <TimToady> I coulda used some ♨ in the UK last week...

[00:27] <markstos> TimToady: and the idea is generally to take the list of functions listed here, and have them work like Perl 5, as a base line?

[00:27] <markstos> http://feather.perl6.nl/syn/S29.html#Pending_Apocalypse

[00:27] <lambdabot> Title: S29, http://tinyurl.com/zsx4l

[00:28] <clkao> TimToady: appearantly Bath now has bathable bath

[00:28] <clkao> since last month

[00:28] <TimToady> well, except we're trying to rationalize everything into packages and the alias into *

[00:28] <TimToady> *then

[00:28] <TimToady> what, did they get amoebas again or something?

[00:29] <markstos> TimToady: is the packages organization something important to spec'ed before implementation, or will it end up close enough to the same ?

[00:30] <markstos> I mean, will things like 'unlink' and 'chown' which have tests already: will the syntax/loading of them change ?

[00:30] *** frederico joined
[00:31] <TimToady> for now you can assume most of the important ones will automatically be in the * namespace.

[00:31] <TimToady> 'course, many of them are multis, so it doesn't really matter where they are...

[00:33] <markstos> Ok. Anyway, the doc will be labeled DRAFT at first, and if people care about a stable implementation, they can bring questions about key functions to p6l for review and assurance.

[00:34] <markstos> I could see the process being a little organic, with the stuff people care about more stabilizing first.

[00:34] <TimToady> audreyt: I forget what we said was the unified notation that allowed both push(@a,1,2,3) and push(@a: 1,2,3)

[00:35] <markstos> TimToady: is there a precendent for what the S12 file name should be? IO.pod ?

[00:35] <TimToady> was it an ordinary multi with a : on the semi-invocant?

[00:36] <TimToady> S16?

[00:36] <markstos> er, yes.

[00:36] <TimToady> not that I know of...

[00:37] <TimToady> or was it an ordinary method with a *name?

[00:37] <TimToady> or something else?

[00:46] <svnbot6> r13251 | markstos++ | S16, IO.pod, springs forth from the quantum foam.

[00:47] <markstos> TimToady:  If that looks OK to you as a Draft, you could go ahead and remove the "S16" section currently in S29, and reference this.

[00:48] <TimToady> you could do it too.  That's why I left S29 in the clutches of pugs commiters, after all.  :)

[00:50] <markstos> Oh, right.

[00:51] <TimToady> and I'd much rather *give* forgiveness than permission.  :)

[00:52] <markstos> heh

[00:55] <audreyt> TimToady: the unified notation is

[00:55] <svnbot6> r13252 | markstos++ | remove section referencing S16 from S29, since we have S16 now.

[00:55] <audreyt> method push is export

[00:55] <TimToady> ah, right

[00:55] <audreyt> which installs a parsetime redispatcher macro

[00:55] <audreyt> that you can turn off using normal import notation

[00:57] <TimToady> thanks.

[00:57] <audreyt> glad to be of service :)

[00:57] <TimToady> what do you think about the X metaoperator?

[00:58] <audreyt> sorry, I missed the context

[00:58] <audreyt> outer product?

[00:58] *** hikozaemon joined
[00:58] <TimToady> that and a bunch of other stuff.

[00:58] <markstos> audreyt: It was in a recent patch to p6l

[00:58] <TimToady> see S03 diffs

[00:59] <markstos> I thought the X metaoperator looked kinda mathy.

[00:59] <TimToady> It's supposed to stand out a little.

[00:59] <markstos> I had trouble thinking of a "use case" for my own work.

[00:59] <TimToady> It has to stand up to a list.

[01:00] <TimToady> I suspect X~ will be the most used.

[01:00] <TimToady> but also ordinary X

[01:00] <markstos> Yes, I think that's the part I'd be most likely to use myself.

[01:00] <audreyt> I wonder if we are piecemeal reinventing comprehensions...

[01:00] <audreyt> in a fragmented way, that is

[01:00] <TimToady> for @a X @b X @c -> [$a,$b,$c] { ... }

[01:00] <TimToady> instead of three nested loops.

[01:01] <markstos> audreyt: "comprehensions" ? which language has that ?

[01:01] <markstos> TimToady... on, neat.

[01:01] <audreyt> [ a ++ b ++ c | a <- as, b <- bs, c <- cs ]

[01:01] <audreyt> is the haskell equivalent of X~

[01:01] <audreyt> markstos: js2, python, haskell, scala, etc

[01:02] <audreyt> I also wonder about "X," vs "X ,"

[01:02] <audreyt> that's one drawback of ident as metaop char

[01:03] <audreyt> though X is indeed a good visual metaphor

[01:03] <TimToady> for a while I had it XopX

[01:03] <TimToady> but it was too cluttered

[01:03] <audreyt> that's very mooselike

[01:03] *** azr|elious joined
[01:03] <audreyt> X,X

[01:03] <TimToady> @a X*X @b X*X @c

[01:03] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: all-dicts arr ask . v

[01:04] <audreyt> though in a sense, as it's infix, circum shows no bias

[01:04] <TimToady> well, there is bias in that the right side varies faster.  :)

[01:04] <audreyt> yeah but it's like saying in numeric addition the right side varies faster :)

[01:04] * audreyt ponders

[01:05] <TimToady> I agree X, is a bit dicey

[01:05] <audreyt> I think I prefer X*X and X,X really.

[01:05] <audreyt> otherwise I tend ot see

[01:05] <audreyt> X*

[01:05] <TimToady> When I had it that was @

[01:05] <audreyt> as somehow involving postfix *

[01:06] <TimToady> X~ was X and X was XX

[01:06] <audreyt> ugh, that would allow @@@

[01:06] <TimToady> typo

[01:06] <TimToady> I keep typing @ for X

[01:06] <audreyt> mm, they are, like, next to each other on keyboard :)

[01:07] <TimToady> on the assumption that X : XX :: x : xx

[01:07] <audreyt> I think I'd prefer that.

[01:07] <audreyt> X being shorthand for X~X

[01:07] <TimToady> then for a while I had stringy as ~X, but that got really ugly with longer ones.

[01:07] <audreyt> because if those two occur most frequent in real use

[01:07] <obra> audreyt: how hard would it be to let declarative action subclasses modify or add arguments

[01:07] *** zgh joined
[01:08] <audreyt> then they warrant a noiseless form

[01:08] *** mjk joined
[01:08] <TimToady> yes, I could certainly be argued back into that position.

[01:08] <audreyt> obra: line 121 Jifty::Param::Schema

[01:09] <audreyt> obra: semantically, add a hook there would do

[01:09] <TimToady> and arguably stringy would probably be more common than listy

[01:09] <audreyt> ergonomically, I have no idea, which is why I punted.

[01:09] <audreyt> TimToady: yup

[01:09] <TimToady> plus the x/xx similarity

[01:09] <audreyt> and I'm not quite sure metaop is warranted to be honest.

[01:10] <audreyt> [*]<<([X] ...)

[01:10] <audreyt> looks good enough to me

[01:10] <TimToady> [*]<< gets pretty ugly

[01:10] <markstos> yep

[01:10] <audreyt> perhaps [X*X] ?

[01:10] <audreyt> or [X*] ?

[01:10] <audreyt> as a variation on the [\*] form

[01:11] <audreyt> which is like an extra / on the [\]

[01:11] <TimToady> doesn't have right precedence unless it's like zip

[01:11] <TimToady> and then you need parens

[01:11] <audreyt> yeah. so X, XX, X*X

[01:11] <audreyt> does it make our precomposed metaop lexing explore combinatorially? :)

[01:12] <TimToady> can still do [*]<<( @a X

[01:12] <TimToady> etc.

[01:12] <TimToady> XX @b XX @c ...

[01:12] <audreyt> I don't know, this looks less general than [] and >><< still

[01:12] <TimToady> I was wondering about that.  At some point we give up pregenerating htem.

[01:13] <audreyt> but I think X and XX is good

[01:13] * audreyt ponders about the XYX chromosomal metaoperator

[01:13] <audreyt> I need to run in a few mins :) I think X*X can be implemented without too much hassle

[01:14] <audreyt> and I really like it keeping *'s infix image

[01:14] <TimToady> well, sure, it's just sugar for the hyperreduce

[01:14] <audreyt> yup

[01:14] <TimToady> I'll change spec back to X*X then.

[01:14] <audreyt> and X and Xx :)

[01:14] <audreyt> er, XX.

[01:14] <audreyt> TimToady++

[01:14] <TimToady> XXX would be cool too.

[01:14] <audreyt> curiously, that means XXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX

[01:15] <audreyt> are all valid

[01:15] <TimToady> though XopX may already be dwimmy on multidims

[01:15] <TimToady> if we really want outer product of matrices

[01:15] <audreyt> does XXXXX parse as X twice producted

[01:15] *** b00t joined
[01:15] <obra> audreyt: thanks

[01:16] <TimToady> seems...exxxxxcessive

[01:16] <audreyt> if so the precomposition is boundless

[01:16] <audreyt> yeah. so perhaps only allow X>>X<<X and >>XXX<<

[01:16] <audreyt> and not more layers

[01:16] <bsb> audreyt: I agree with the list comprehensions point.  I'd prefer to generate, permute, filter and process in glue-able parts

[01:17] <audreyt> bsb: did you see how Scala does it?

[01:17] <audreyt> it's sheer genius

[01:27] <markstos> fglock; it's great! I'll post it now.

[01:28] <markstos> Is there anything else you wanted to add ?

[01:28] <fglock> anything you'd like to ask?

[01:29] <fglock> I'll give a 2h tutorial on v6.pm in YAPC::SA

[01:29] <bsb> scala comprehensions let the inner enumerator depend on the outer ones, can X? eg. $i=1..10; $j = 1..$i

[01:30] <markstos> fglock: P6-on-P6 makes my head hurt. Doesn't there need to be binary involved for that ?

[01:31] <audreyt> the "binary" is a perl5 file :)

[01:31] <audreyt> perl5 source code, even.

[01:31] <audreyt> (v6.pm uses perl5 as perl6's "object code")

[01:31] <markstos> That's P6 on P5, which I understand.

[01:31] <audreyt> yeah, once you have P6-on-anything you can use that to boot p6-on-p6.

[01:31] <markstos> He said a goal is P6-on-P6, which makes my head hurt. :)

[01:32] <markstos> So the Perl 6 script is run the Perl 6 compiler, which may be a script that runs a Perl 5 binary ?

[01:33] *** NamelessOne joined
[01:33] <fglock> clkao: it would be great if you could give a talk

[01:33] <fglock> markstos: when you compile p6 to p5, you get a .pmc

[01:34] <fglock> p6-on-p6 will have a bunch of p5 pmc files

[01:34] <clkao> fglock: will let you know once i decide

[01:35] <fglock> if you modify the p6 source, it will regenerate the pmc

[01:35] <markstos> But it could run as a fast as "Perl 5 speeds", because of the PMC files ?

[01:35] <fglock> clkao: great

[01:35] <fglock> markstos: yes

[01:35] <markstos> Got it. It may be a little slower because of the extra layers, but computers may be a little faster. :)

[01:36] <fglock> perl5 will "see" only the pmc files, but once a p6 source is modified, then the compiler is called again

[01:37] <fglock> pmc files don't have the extra layer - they don't even have a "use v6-alpha" line

[01:37] *** weinig joined
[01:37] <markstos> Got it (But they are additional abstraction in some cases, like using Sub::Multi/Data::Bind, etc)

[01:37] <markstos> Another question: How hard is it to add additional language features ?

[01:38] <fglock> markstos: re features - you pay for what you use

[01:38] <markstos> Is there any part of Perl 6 that you say as "impossible" to implement this way?

[01:38] <markstos> fglock: I see what at you are saying: If you don't use Sub::Multi, it is never loaded.

[01:38] <fglock> mmm

[01:39] <markstos> s/say/see/

[01:39] <fglock> some perl6 features might be slow in perl5 - like coroutines

[01:39] <fglock> but not impossible

[01:40] <markstos> Cool.

[01:43] <fglock> markstos: some features were already implemented in pil-run, which was the previous p6-on-p5 - they just need to be "ported" to v6

[01:43] <fglock> like junctions

[01:44] <fglock> and lazy lists

[04:43] <gaal> who asked for a moose metaoperator? ╙*╜

[04:52] <svnbot6> r13254 | putter++ | t/xx-uncategorized/S29_spec.t - Created.  Some failing tests from the top of S29.

[04:54] <gaal> audreyt, TimToady: :($ : $x) is precisely what I had been parsing :(: $x) as. I need to think about this some more to figure out a predictive parsing strategy - there's already a comment in the code about how I'm unhappy with the first param being parsed twice...

[05:05] <bsb> gaal:  what does the meta-moose do?

[05:06] <gaal> "what would you like it to do?" }:)

[05:07] <bsb> kinda looks like it forks...

[05:07] <gaal> hmm, you can't define metaoperators in Perl 6, can you?

[05:07] <gaal> I mean new ones.

[05:08] <bsb> not that I know of

[05:14] <MacVince> Does Perl 6 have exceptions?

[05:14] <MacVince> With a try/catch block?

[05:15] <gaal> yes. "die" throws, CATCH blocks catch

[05:15] <gaal> try { } protects against propagation

[05:15] <mugwump> gaal: S06 lists infix_prefix_meta_operator:<!>, prefix_circumfix_meta_operator:{'[',']'}, etc

[05:15] <gaal> note that unlike most other languages with exceptions, the CATCH block lives *inside* the block throwing.

[05:16] <MacVince> inside?

[05:16] <gaal> MacVince: instead of try { die "" } catch { "oh la la" }...

[05:16] <gaal> try { die "" CATCH { ... } }

[05:16] <gaal> in fact, if you have a CATCH block, the 'try' is optional.

[05:17] <MacVince> ok

[05:17] <MacVince> Well, from a first look, that looks weird, but I can probably get used to it :)

[05:17] <gaal> MacVince: this is in line with many other closure traits that Perl 6 offers.

[05:18] <gaal> also, the scoping rules are probably clearer

[05:33] <svnbot6> r13255 | putter++ | pi() is now more like spec.  I'm trying to get it right, as a way of shaking down Prelude.pm and Prim.hs problems.

[05:33] <svnbot6> r13255 | putter++ | Prim.hs - "pi" renamed "Pugs::Internals::pi".  Surprisingly, it no longer works in this form!  Now yields {obj:Code::Exp}.

[05:33] <svnbot6> r13255 | putter++ | Prelude.pm - Added Math::Basic::pi, S29.  I would have liked to ::= Pugs::Internals::pi, but with that not working, a literal value is used.

[05:33] <svnbot6> r13255 | putter++ | Prelude.pm - Added *pi(), for backwards compatibility.  This is non-spec. S29 says  use Math::Basic :constants  is needed to get pi.  That's next.  I would have liked to ::= Math::Basic::pi, but that wasn't working in the Prelude.

[12:53] <gaal> I still don't know how to deal with the predictivity predicament

[12:53] <audreyt> by taking weird drugs without first consulting its side effects ;) (it's meant to be taken before sleep, apparently)

[12:54] <Limbic_Region> well, you need rest so I guess it was a fortunate accident

[12:54] <audreyt> true, which means I'll be sleeping in but a few mins, too... still feeling kinda dizzy; it's better than jet lag though.

[12:54] <Limbic_Region> if you are interested in the dream, you were driving (which you were nervous about) and didn't know how to properly go through standing water on the road

[12:54] <audreyt> gaal: what makes it impredictit again?

[12:54] <Limbic_Region> you ended up causing the car to spin in circles 3 times - at which point I offered to drive

[12:55] <gaal> see the comment above inv <- in ruleParam

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> you felt extremely embarrased and offered to get one of the old cars you had lying out in the field

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> I ended up driving - to a campus of some sort

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> odd huh

[12:55] <audreyt> gaal: well first you remove the first case

[12:56] <audreyt> and then do a parse over ruleParam

[12:56] <gaal> because :(:) is illegal?

[12:56] <audreyt> if it's not there, you have (Nothin, []) as (inv, params)

[12:56] <audreyt> yes

[12:56] <audreyt> if it's there, you then look for lexeme char oneOf ",:"

[12:56] <gaal> :(:) was a mood disorder anyway

[12:57] <audreyt> and if it's :, you know it's inv, and parse as needed

[12:57] <audreyt> in either case the rest is sepby lexeme char '.'

[12:57] <audreyt> and if the oneOf ",:" is not foudnd, you have (Nthing, [first]) as (iv, params)

[13:13] <audreyt> this is, however, extremely underspecced, and only intuitable from examples

[13:13] <audreyt> actually, the Sig-at-lhs is not intuitable, so it remains conjectural

[13:13] <audreyt> but I think it's more consistent that way.

[13:13] <gaal> I have a patch attempt that turned into a warnocked p6l post about paramdecl/sigs, so I'll pass for now...

[13:14] <gaal> yeah, I think so.

[13:15] <gaal> so my :(complex_sig1) = my :(complex_sig2) will just work?

[13:15] <gaal> that's groovy but scary.

[13:19] * gaal can't think of any iambic trimeter poems right now...

[13:20] <gaal> but it's common enough, with caesura, in pentameter

[13:20] <Limbic_Region> lumi - if you are not familiar with the gripping hand - check out the jargon file

[13:20] <gaal> Limbic_Region: "=>" is sorta "such that"

[13:21] <gaal> Limbic_Region: I can't think of a good englishification of ->.

[13:21] <audreyt> "maps into"

[13:21] <Limbic_Region> gaal - am re-reading ch. 4 in YAHT cause I don't think I fully got it

[13:21] <gaal> but for a simple example:

[13:21] <Limbic_Region> I was able to understand the examples but I didn't do a good job of generating my own in the examples

[13:21] <gaal> (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a

[13:21] <Limbic_Region> when I get to one that I had trouble with - I will ping again (assuming a haskell speaking person is around - else will pop over to #haskell)

[13:22] <gaal> for numeric a, the function has type a -> a -> a

[13:22] <Limbic_Region> well - you still have a lot of symbols and not enough english in there

[13:23] <Limbic_Region> gaal - why is it a -> a -> a and not a -> a

[13:23] <gaal> the easiest way to begin with -> is to treat it like an arg separator, with the convention that the last one is the return value.

[13:23] <agentzh> LR: haskell is like maths instead of english. :)

[13:24] <audreyt> for any type X in the Num type class, this function takes a value of type X, and returns a function that takes another value of type X, and then return a value of type X.

[13:24] <Limbic_Region> I understood that from context

[13:24] <gaal> (+) x y = z

[13:24] <Limbic_Region> but I still am having a hard time thinking of it in english

[13:24] <gaal> they are all Num

[13:24] <gaal> including the return value z

[13:24] <audreyt> what's more, then are all of the same type.

[13:24] <gaal> and the same num

[13:24] <gaal> right

[13:24] <Limbic_Region> agentzh - yes, I know - but I am trying to find devices that will help me "get" the language

[13:25] <gaal> Limbic_Region: audreyt points out the pretty profound principle in haskell that all functions are basically unary

[13:25] <agentzh> LR: there're error handling though.

[13:25] <Limbic_Region> I am having a hard time understanding it

[13:25] <gaal> except if they're nullary :)

[13:26] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[13:26] <gaal> so for now just thing of it this way

[13:26] <gaal> 1. drop off the last element

[13:26] <Limbic_Region> that's the return - yes

[13:26] <gaal> 2. s/->/, /g

[13:27] <gaal> (+) :: some Num type, the same Num type, returns the same Num type

[13:27] <Limbic_Region> ok - so if I am reading you correctly then

[13:27] <gaal> or let's take a different example:

[13:27] <gaal> @type length

[13:27] <lambdabot> forall a. [a] -> Int

[13:27] <gaal> ignore the forall

[13:27] <Limbic_Region> (+) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a

[13:27] <gaal> length :: [a] -> Int

[13:28] <Limbic_Region> wait

[13:28] <Limbic_Region> let me work this out

[13:28] <gaal> ok

[13:28] <Limbic_Region> (+) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a

[13:28] <Limbic_Region> start with "returns type a" allowing the last -> to be dropped

[13:28] <Limbic_Region> saving it away for later

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> turn any -> into commas which indicate the number of parameters

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> both of the same type

[13:29] <gaal> (brb, phone)

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> the thing on the left hand side of the fat arrow is defining the specific type of a

[13:29] <[particle]> looks like 'a' is an alias for 'Num'

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> so, given to numerical values of the same type, return a numerical value of that type

[13:29] <lumi> Not the specific type, it just constrains it to a typeclass

[13:30] <Limbic_Region> lumi - I am interchanging typeclass and type here

[13:30] <Limbic_Region> I know that is not correct

[13:30] <audreyt> [particle]: Num corresponds to a role in perl6

[13:30] <Limbic_Region> but that's cause I am not thinking of static typing

[13:30] <audreyt> Num is an interface that various concrete types can satisfy

[13:31] <Limbic_Region> yes - I get that part no problem

[13:31] <audreyt> as long as they provide simple things like "negate" and "abs" etc

[13:31] <Limbic_Region> ok, so I think I can now look at the type signatures and translate them into verbal tags

[13:31] *** ofer0 joined
[13:32] <Limbic_Region> which theoretically means I can take words in my head and make type signatures out of them

[13:32] <Limbic_Region> no longer read-only - thansk

[13:32] <Limbic_Region> thanks even

[13:32] <audreyt> Limbic_Region++

[13:32] * audreyt goes to catch some more sleep *wave* :)

[13:32] <Limbic_Region> sleep well - and don't crash any cars in your dreams

[13:33] <audreyt> I'll think of square roots of giraffes instead

[13:36] <Limbic_Region> gaal - when you are off the phone, I have a question for you

[13:37] <Limbic_Region> let's say I wanted to create an add_op which was smarter than (+)

[13:38] <Limbic_Region> in that both sides of the op inlined with `add_op` do not have to be of the same type

[13:38] <Limbic_Region> what would the signature for that look like?

[13:39] <[particle]> say, using Num and Str for example? or Foo, or Whatever.

[13:39] <Limbic_Region> I am thinking I would need multiple signatures

[13:39] * [particle] watches and learns

[13:41] <Limbic_Region> particle - there is already some magic going on because of the typeclass

[13:41] <Limbic_Region> I am intentionally removing that magic to see what the signature would look like

[13:42] <Limbic_Region> for instance - haskell has no problem handling 3 + .1415926535897932384626433

[13:42] <Limbic_Region> because both sides are of the typeclass Num

[13:42] <Limbic_Region> and there is some internal wrangling to decide that a float should be returned and not an int

[13:42] <[particle]> right, as audreyt said, typeclass is ~~ perl 6 role

[13:43] <lumi> That's in the parser

[13:43] <Limbic_Region> my question is what would the signature look like if instead you had done something like let x = 3::int and y = .14 :: float

[13:43] <lumi> Well, soon after, something like fromIntegral

[13:44] <Limbic_Region> and then did - x `add_op` y

[13:44] <lumi> You want.. add_op :: (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> a

[13:44] <lumi> or sth?

[13:44] <lumi> What should be the return?

[13:44] <Limbic_Region> nope, that's it

[13:44] <Limbic_Region> and is what I was thinking

[13:45] <Limbic_Region> except that they are not in Num anymore are they

[13:45] <Limbic_Region> so it would be something like add_op :: (Int, Float) => a -> b -> b

[13:45] *** dakkar joined
[13:45] <Limbic_Region> except that expects a certain ordering

[13:46] <lumi> Limbic_Region: You put types where constraints should be

[13:46] <Limbic_Region> so my assumption that I would need multiple signatures is the question really

[13:46] <lumi> You want just: add_op :: Int -> Float -> Float -- ?

[13:46] <Limbic_Region> ahhh

[13:47] <Limbic_Region> so that would mean it doesn't matter if I did y `add_op` x or x `add_op` y ?

[13:48] <lumi> I don't quite understand.. You want to do (1 :: Int) `add_op` (1 :: Float) or the other way around, freely?

[13:48] <lumi> And for it to have the same return type?

[13:49] <Limbic_Region> lumi - forget floats and ints for a second as I think I am complicating things by mangling something haskell automatically handles

[13:49] <lumi> What do you want to happen?

[13:49] <Limbic_Region> let's say I have a function that can take two different types (neither of which is part of a typeclass) in any order

[13:50] <lumi> Functions can't take things in any order

[13:50] <Limbic_Region> and return one of those two types

[13:50] *** putter joined
[13:50] <Limbic_Region> lumi - I thought so, so multiple signatures

[13:50] <Limbic_Region> ?

[13:50] <lumi> Oh, a -> b -> Either a b maybe?

[13:51] <lumi> The 'maybe' doesn't belong in the signature (sorry)

[13:51] <Limbic_Region> yeah, I knew what you meant - though maybe is a type too ;-)

[13:51] <putter> mugwump: details?  no.  Perhaps v6 has some p6 on CPAN.  I don't know what else might.

[13:51] <lumi> Limbic_Region: No, Maybe is a type :P

[13:51] <Limbic_Region> what I think I am really getting at here is multi-function dispatch

[13:52] <lumi> You can get that with typeclasses

[13:52] <Limbic_Region> ok, so I define a typeclass that contains both the types I want to handle

[13:52] <Limbic_Region> the signature gets simplified

[13:52] <lumi> This could get really tricky really fast

[13:53] <Limbic_Region> and the underlying code of the function needs to be told what specifically to return

[13:53] <lumi> No... you have to know what to return, for the signature

[13:53] <Limbic_Region> I can see doing it that way - but I still am interested in if multiple signatures for a function is allowec

[13:53] <lumi> "no" except using typeclasses

[13:53] <Limbic_Region> lumi - the signature will be the typeclass

[13:54] <audreyt> class Addable a b c | a b -> c where

[13:54] <audreyt>     add_op :: a -> b -> c

[13:54] <audreyt> instance Addable a b c => Addable b a c where

[13:54] <putter> re dreams, sigh.  I get code reviews of things written day before.  ;)

[13:54] <audreyt>     add_op = flip add_op

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> or rather, the return in the signature will be the typeclass

[13:54] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: you seem to be wondering if (a|b) -> (a|b) -> (a|b) is allowed

[14:30] <putter> since I'm 0 for 2 this morning, could I get someone to reality check me on the following.  Math::Basic is a module.  Some of it is always available, some only on use().  Two deisign optionis.  Prelude.pm could require() a normal Basic.pm.  Slow.  Or Prelude could contain the always available (like now), and Basic be

[14:30] *** pasteling joined
[14:31] <putter> err, "fake"?, ie, it's development coordinated with Prelude, with it only containing the at request stuff (eg, pi()).

[14:32] <putter> Given the effort to make the Prelude go fast, the second option seems preferable.

[14:32] <putter> Perhaps create an ext/Pugs-Prelude/  to contain a Math::Basic with these somewhat odd properties.

[14:32] <putter> Anyone have any thoughts?

[14:33] *** pmurias_ joined
[14:33] <putter> s/effort/effort invested/

[14:33] <gaal> putter: if some of it is always in, then it sohuld be part of the prelude and be precompiled.

[14:34] <gaal> whether the code lives in the file Prelude.pm or in some other pm file is... technical

[14:34] <putter> ;)

[14:34] <gaal> we actually have a (somewhat hacy) way of catting together files for the prelude!

[14:35] <putter> so is there some way to create a Foo.pm that gets so catted, but still behaves normally if the user use()s it?

[14:36] <pmurias_> gaal: does it get catted on the AST or source level?

[14:36] *** dakkar_ joined
[14:36] <gaal> pmurias_: source.

[14:37] <gaal> but that's before compilation.

[14:37] <gaal> putter: yes. modulo possible bugs with %*INC...

[14:38] <gaal> putter: look at config.yml for where to put it

[14:57] <putter> audreyt: ping?

[14:57] *** elmex joined
[15:00] <putter> audreyt: pugs design guidance question.  Couple of options.  Motivated by it seeming undesirable that a Math::Basic.pm get use()d, and loaded, by Prelude, all the time.  (1) use precompiled_modules, which should probably then be turned on by default.

[15:01] <putter> Downside is it makes the precompiled_modules hackery more critical.

[15:02] <putter> (2) Create ext/Pugs-Prelude, with a trimmed Math::Basic containing just those things users need to explicitly import, with the rest being in Prelude.pm.

[15:04] <putter> (3) ... "putter, work on something else!".  Prelude-ification of primitives having proved a minefield in the past, perhaps it is no longer a top of the todo list objective(?), and I should leave it alone until things are more stable.

[15:04] <putter> Any preferences?

[15:07] <audreyt> reparse is currently cheap. 1) is most sensible and is _much_ easier with newExp (less recursive Pad bookkeeping). probably prelude should be renamed GLOBAL.pm or some such at some point. and yes I'm sleeping :)

[15:08] <audreyt> translates to: if Prelude imports and reexports Math::Basic I think it'd get included into Prelude.pm.yml at this moment; so no special action needed.

[15:09] <audreyt> if you feel like it, some investigation would be helpful/fun

[15:09] <audreyt> changelogging can also use some help if you are lloking for specific something else :)

[15:49] <gaal> agentzh: ChangeLog says of prove6: "You can use this to run only a portion of the test suite or even a single file"

[15:49] <gaal> I don't understand the 'now'.

[15:49] <gaal> you could do that with prove before.

[15:50] <agentzh> the old prove6 is in csh iirc

[15:50] <gaal> prove w/o 6

[15:50] <agentzh> but i'm talking about prove6. :)

[15:51] <agentzh> instead of the general prove.

[15:51] <agentzh> particle added prove6.bat to make the old csh more general.

[15:51] <agentzh> then i did the rewrite.

[15:52] <agentzh> prove6 is just a shortcut for prove. :)

[17:21] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: how long till your commit? i'm wondering if i should build pugs beforehand

[17:22] *** putter left
[17:22] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - it is working but I can't tell if it is working correctly yet

[17:22] *** zakharyas joined
[17:23] <Limbic_Region> and it is a freaking PITA to ctrl-c and add debug prints and start again

[17:23] <Limbic_Region> I would say within the next 30 minutes

[17:23] <[particle]> ok, i'll build pugsas a baseline

[17:23] <[particle]> that way i can compare test results

[17:26] <Limbic_Region> yeah, I have already done that and have intentionally not svn'd up while I have been working on this

[17:27] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - you are going to need to set an env var to specify the number of children handlers

[17:27] <[particle]> i can handle that :)

[17:27] <Limbic_Region> PUGS_TESTS_CONCURRENT

[17:27] <[particle]> what are you testing with now?

[17:27] <Limbic_Region> well, 10 but I am not sure my branch to use P::FM is being taken

[17:28] <Limbic_Region> so I just did a whole bunch of print statements to see

[17:28] <[particle]> is it faster?

[17:28] <Limbic_Region> not letting it finish to find out

[17:28] <fglock> jdv79: re implementation of p6 rules and grammars - http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule/lib/Pugs/Grammar/Rule2.pm is compiled with v6.pm

[17:28] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/egsnm

[17:28] <Limbic_Region> something I expected to happen didn't

[17:29] <[particle]> oh, i figured you'd run a subset of the tests, is that possible?

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - it is but is difficult to do via nmake smoke

[17:29] <[particle]> also, you could have the children print their pid on start/stop

[17:29] <Limbic_Region> and because things don't always work the same from the command line as through the harness

[17:30] <[particle]> ah, i see

[17:30] <Limbic_Region> I am using the harness to be sure

[17:30] <[particle]> well, perhaps you could remove some of the test dirs from your working copy

[17:30] <Limbic_Region> ok - it is has got to the part of the build where it is running the harness - should know in a few secs if it is working correctly

[17:31] <Limbic_Region> ok - it doesn't look like it is taking my P::FM branch for some reason - debugging

[17:31] <jdv79> fglock: thanks

[17:32] <jdv79> doesn't PGE implement them as well?

[17:32] <[particle]> jdv79: yes

[17:32] <Limbic_Region> darn it

[17:33] <Limbic_Region> the window I set the env var in isn't the one I am running the harness from

[17:33] <[particle]> gah

[17:34] <jdv79> its just that one is parrot

[17:34] <jdv79> 's and one is pug's then?

[17:34] <[particle]> jdv79: https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/grammar_rules.pg

[17:34] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/k9tzr

[17:34] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - how long is your current build taking to smoke?

[17:34] <fglock> jdv79: one is parrot and the other is perl5

[17:35] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: i've never run make smoke

[17:35] <[particle]> right now, my build is failing :(

[17:35] <jdv79> do you forsee PGE becoming the only one or both tracking on into the night?

[17:35] <[particle]> looks like it's calling gcc for some reason...

[17:35] <jdv79> just trying to get an idea of their relationship, if any;)

[17:35] <Limbic_Region> :(

[17:36] <[particle]> jdv79: there are multiple implementations of the perl6 spec at the moment

[17:36] <fglock> jdv79: actually, both these files are perl6

[17:36] <[particle]> pugs with haskell back end, v6-alpha with perl5 back end

[17:37] <[particle]> perl6 with parrot back end

[17:37] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - so the handrolled version says "how many children are you willing to start" then it divides the tests equally and each one runs the test in serial

[17:38] <[particle]> ok

[17:38] <Limbic_Region> I just made P::FM do the same thing - replacing the fork with ->start.  Lots of improvements could be made by taking advantage of some of the P::FM features though

[17:38] <Limbic_Region> which is why I said there is lots of room for improvement

[17:38] <[particle]> jdv79: there is no clear winner at the moment.

[17:39] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: i need to get compiling first. dunno what's wrong

[17:39] <Limbic_Region> k - tried realclean yet?

[17:40] <Limbic_Region> and/or have you changed perl/ghc versions recently?

[17:40] <[particle]> doing that now

[17:40] <[particle]> i'm using your 0906 image

[17:40] <[particle]> w/ as perl 5.8.8b817

[17:40] <[particle]> i haven't yet gotten it to compile with this setup

[17:40] <[particle]> but i haven't tried in some time

[17:42] *** weinig joined
[17:42] <svnbot6> r13267 | fglock++ | Pugs-Compiler-Rule - "lrep" is no longer used to bootstrap - moved to misc/lrep

[17:43] <Limbic_Region> ok - that should work - the only thing that I can possibly think of is that 817 requires a patch to make XS modules build with Module::Build to work

[17:43] <Limbic_Region> I am using the 0906 image and 5.8.8 817 myself

[17:43] <Limbic_Region> oh, but you don't use MinGW though right - so nevermind that stuff about the patch

[17:44] <[particle]> right, no mingw

[17:44] <[particle]> okay, so i'm doing makefile.pl now

[17:44] <[particle]> i was doing make fast btw

[17:44] <[particle]> should that work?

[17:44] <Limbic_Region> AFAIK

[17:45] <[particle]> and will the tests run in human time?

[17:45] <[particle]> or geologic?

[17:45] <Limbic_Region> < 1 hour for me

[17:45] <Limbic_Region> about a week ago it was only half that

[17:45] <[particle]> ok, but you don't make fast, right?

[17:47] <[particle]> fglock: have you looked at parrot's perl6 grammar so they can be consolidated where appropriate?

[17:48] <jdv79> i still can't underand the whole p6 on p5 - just seems like it would be really slow and nobody and why would one use it?

[17:49] <jdv79> its definitely "cool" though

[17:49] <fglock> [particle]: yes - the PGE grammar doesn't use return objects, or hash dispatch; otoh, the v6.pm grammar doesn't use post-processing, it emits directly from the syntax tree

[17:49] <Limbic_Region> no particle - but according to audreyt, the runtime difference between the two is getting less and less worth the extra compile time

[17:50] <Limbic_Region> she was almost ready to make fast the default

[17:50] <[particle]> fglock: yes, i think we should work on a common AST, parrot is heading in this direction. that would decouple front-end from back-end

[17:50] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: ok, i'm 'fast'ing now

[17:50] <fglock> [particle]: have you seen the v6-Compiler initial grammar?

[17:51] <[particle]> fglock: i'm a bit behind on the status of v6-Compiler atm

[17:51] <fglock> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/v6/v6-Compiler/lib/v6/Grammar/Native.pm

[17:51] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/kv35c

[17:51] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - I have a feeling that something external is affecting the behavior of what I am doing - trying to isolate now

[17:51] <fglock> it constructs AST from the grammar

[17:51] <Limbic_Region> IOW - no matter what I do, I can't get it to follow the P::FM branch

[17:53] <Limbic_Region> yep, just as I suspected

[17:53] <[particle]> my build still fails :(

[17:53] <Limbic_Region> something is setting the concurrent=1

[17:53] <Limbic_Region> nopaste the error?

[17:53] <[particle]> nopasting, and trying optimized

[17:54] <pasteling> "[particle]" at 144.81.84.173 pasted "win32 build error" (746 lines, 36.6K) at http://sial.org/pbot/19662

[17:56] <Limbic_Region> I found the problem - config.yml

[17:57] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - do you have any logs of builds that succeded?

[17:58] <svnbot6> r13268 | fglock++ | Pugs-Compiler-Rule - removed more bootstrapping files

[17:58] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: doubtful

[17:58] <Limbic_Region> the CC = gcc looks suspect to me

[17:58] <[particle]> yeah, i don't know why that's occuring

[17:58] <[particle]> is gcc installed with ghc?

[17:59] <[particle]> and if so, why is it passing what look like msvc flags?

[17:59] <[particle]> it looks like i'm using 0819, not 0906

[17:59] <[particle]> and CC is set to gcc from that dist

[18:00] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - it looks like different parts of the build are confused about which compiler to use

[18:00] <Limbic_Region> I assume there is an ENV var that will make msvc++ default

[18:01] <[particle]> perhaps, or maybe it's in path

[18:01] <Limbic_Region> fwiw - I am using p::fm now

[18:01] <Limbic_Region> and it appears to be working

[18:01] <[particle]> yay!

[18:01] <Limbic_Region> perhaps 10 is a bit too many though

[18:01] * Limbic_Region lowers it to about 4

[18:01] <[particle]> 5 was a magic number for me in years past

[18:03] <Limbic_Region> I was at 100% cpu so 10 was too many

[18:04] <Limbic_Region> particle - it is in Makefile.PL

[18:04] <Limbic_Region> my $cc = $ENV{CC} || 'gcc';

[18:04] <Limbic_Region> so apparently you just need to set CC appropriately - though I haven't dug further

[18:05] <Limbic_Region> after a realclean that is

[18:06] <[particle]> hrmm, well, i'll give that a try

[18:06] <[particle]> but 'make' seems to work

[18:06] <[particle]> only 'nmake fast' is b0rked

[18:06] <[particle]> smoking now, started at :06

[18:07] <nothingmuch> TimToady: weird perl 5 question- is print $fh "foo" syntactically an indirect method call?

[18:08] <[particle]> why is smoke rebuilding pugs?

[18:08] <Limbic_Region> dunno

[18:08] <Limbic_Region> someone asked that the other day - I thought it was fixed at one time

[18:09] <[particle]> perhaps it's bad dependencies

[18:09] <Limbic_Region> fwiw - it doesn't rebuild everything

[18:10] <Limbic_Region> oh, once it gets to actually running the tests - let me know what your cpu utilization is like

[18:10] <TimToady> nothingmuch: yes

[18:11] <nothingmuch> *click* *whrirr* *spiN*

[18:11] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: ok

[18:11] * nothingmuch lies face down in a pool of oil and crushed pretzels

[18:11] <[particle]> ack. missing dependencies. installing

[18:12] *** MacVince left
[18:12] <nothingmuch> so how come print FOO "moose" is OK, but FOO->print("moose") isn't?

[18:12] <nothingmuch> is indirect dispatch special cased for globs?

[18:12] <svnbot6> r13269 | fglock++ | Pugs-Compiler-Rule - cleanup old files; updated MANIFEST

[18:13] <nothingmuch> the error for 'print $foo "foo"' is different than the one for 'random_method $foo "foo"' when $foo is undef

[18:14] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - I am stuck at 100% cpu even with just 2 instances

[18:14] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: and with 1?

[18:14] <Limbic_Region> didn't check that - possible already at 100%

[18:14] <Limbic_Region> which means this would only benefit really beefy systems or ones with mult cpu

[18:15] <[particle]> still, it allows tuning not previously available

[18:16] * Limbic_Region breaks out to see what 1 process consumes

[18:18] <TimToady> nothingmuch: you asked about syntax.  The semantic analysis treats those differently, yes.

[18:18] *** joshmoore is now known as joshmoore_

[18:22] <Limbic_Region> the laptop at home is dual proc - will try that

[18:23] <Limbic_Region> going to check in yaml_harness.pl

[18:23] <[particle]> ok, i'm running smoke now

[18:24] <svnbot6> r13270 | fglock++ | Pugs-Compiler-Rule - version 0.17 in CPAN

[18:27] <Limbic_Region> few dependencies huh?

[18:27] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[18:27] <svnbot6> r13271 | Limbic_Region++ | Added dependency on List::Util and support for Parallel::ForkManger to allow Win32 concurrency.  Please revert at the first sign of trouble as this has not been heavily tested

[18:28] <[particle]> ah, perhaps smoke depends on install?

[18:28] <[particle]> the parrot paradigm is *don't install*

[18:28] <[particle]> perhaps pugs paradigm is different

[18:30] <Limbic_Region> I don't think so

[18:30] <[particle]> no, perhaps not.

[18:30] <[particle]> in any case, pugs pegs cpu

[18:30] <gaal> fglock: Acme::Module::Authors

[18:32] <Limbic_Region> how beefy is your box?

[18:32] <gaal> Limbic_Region: was 10 above the number of concurrent moose?

[18:32] <gaal> the rule of thumb is cpu_count + 1

[18:33] <gaal> but your antler may vary.

[18:33] *** c6rbon is now known as c6rbon_

[18:33] <gaal> also, 100% CPU is fine. %s not spent on smoking are wasted.

[18:33] *** mauke_ joined
[18:33] *** c6rbon_ is now known as c6rbon

[18:33] <Limbic_Region> gaal - right, but if I am spiked at 1 (i.e. serial)

[18:34] <Limbic_Region> is adding another process (on a single cpu arch) going to buy me anything

[18:34] <Limbic_Region> my reason for adding P::FM support was so that if a winders box had spare CPU we could utilize it

[18:35] <gaal> on a single cpu box probably nothing.

[18:35] <Limbic_Region> since in general, N tasks done in parallel with time slicing is still faster than N tasks down in serial

[18:35] <gaal> on hyperthreading it did win a few %s.

[18:35] <Limbic_Region> this is because of the noops that the cpu does while it is waiting for instruction

[18:35] <gaal> but, just run a few benchmarks and see.

[18:35] <Limbic_Region> unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be any free cpu noop cycles to suck up

[18:35] <Limbic_Region> but my system at home is dual proc so

[18:36] <Limbic_Region> will test there tonight as well

[18:36] <gaal> groovy.

[18:36] <gaal> btw, the setting is best put obtained from config.yml

[18:36] <nothingmuch> hmmmmmmmmmmmm

[18:36] <gaal> this isn't something you change often, and there's no reason to litter the env with it.

[18:36] <gaal> nothingmuch: mmmmmmmh!

[18:36] * nothingmuch wonders how to propagate sigil information in the light of subscripting for the emitter

[18:37] * nothingmuch tries to lie face down in that puddle again

[18:37] <Limbic_Region> gaal - I realized that after the fact - it is in config.yml

[18:37] <nothingmuch> maybe the fumes will inspire me ;-)

[18:37] <Limbic_Region> in fact, it doesn't matter what your env is - if there is a setting in config.yml it will overide it

[18:37] <gaal> nothingmuch: what are you doing on bike day?

[18:37] <nothingmuch> bike day? whuzzat?

[18:37] <Limbic_Region> and the env var wasn't my idea, it was already in yaml_harness.pl

[18:37] <nothingmuch> i can make a guess

[18:37] <nothingmuch> i think i'm more interested in "when"

[18:37] <gaal> i guess your guess is correct

[18:37] <nothingmuch> oh! yom kippur

[18:38] <nothingmuch> heh

[18:38] <gaal> yes

[18:38] <nothingmuch> <embarraced>

[18:38] <nothingmuch> nothingmuch-- # not a good jew at all

[18:38] <nothingmuch> hmm.... i normally slack off with friends

[18:38] <gaal> so, I really wanna use the opportunity and go for a nice ride

[18:38] <gaal> but I think visitng you would be a little too far

[18:38] <nothingmuch> well

[18:39] <nothingmuch> we can go the day before

[18:39] <nothingmuch> and camp somewhere

[18:39] <[particle]> yummy kippers

[18:39] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - is your smoke still running?

[18:39] <nothingmuch> and then bike all day

[18:39] <nothingmuch> and drive back at sundown

[18:39] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: i stopped smoking

[18:39] <nothingmuch> someone bought me that biking in israel book

[18:39] <Limbic_Region> and if yes - is it stuck on ext/libwww/t/ something or other

[18:39] <nothingmuch> let me find some ideas in it

[18:39] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - why?

[18:39] <[particle]> restarting with new yaml_harness

[18:40] <nothingmuch> fwiw, it's a good book

[18:40] <nothingmuch> but not enough trails in the south

[18:40] <Limbic_Region> what happened to baselining?

[18:41] <gaal> oh, 1-2 october, sun-mon

[18:41] <Limbic_Region> btw - you may end up hanging on a test in ext/libwww/t/

[18:41] <Limbic_Region> if you do, just del all .t file in the subdirectory for the purposes of the smoke

[18:41] <Limbic_Region> there is no easy way to skip tests through make smoke

[18:43] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: i moved the baseline to concurrency=1

[18:43] <[particle]> then i'll test more

[18:43] *** bernhard joined
[18:44] <Limbic_Region> okie dokie

[18:45] <gaal> cool

[18:45] <gaal> bbiab

[18:45] <nothingmuch> i'll make a list of possible trails

[18:46] <gaal> aw, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and silly left the spec :(

[18:46] <lanny> Hmm.  If I have code:  my $x = $obj.foo();  $x.bar();   which does what I expect then is there a situation where $obj.foo().bar() shouldn't do the same thing?  (Cause I have such a situation.)

[18:47] <Limbic_Region> (method chaining)-- # IMO

[18:48] <Limbic_Region> does $obj.foo return a different object than $obj or a copy of $obj ?

[18:48] <Limbic_Region> I believe it should work either way btw

[18:48] *** mauke_ is now known as mauke

[18:49] <lanny> Specifically I'm playing with 'is also' on Pair to add methods car() and cdr().  I build a list (A B (C D) E).  my $p = $cons.cdr.cdr.car; $p.car() correctly gives 'C'.  $cons.cdr.cdr.car.car() does not parse with 'cannot find method car() on Any'.

[18:50] <lanny> car() has implicit return signature (i.e., 'our method car...') while cdr of Pair ().

[18:51] <lanny> However if I use .key and .value instead of car and cdr everything works as expected.

[18:51] * Limbic_Region ducks and watches the greek fly over his head like a 747

[18:51] <lanny> So it seems like with method chaining the type knowledge that I'm working with a Pair doesn't seem to catch up with the method call.

[18:51] <Limbic_Region> if the syntax is valid then it is a pugs bug - but I have no idea if it is valid

[18:51] <lanny> I'll write a test then.

[18:52] <nothingmuch> gaal: ctx switch to ICQ/AIM/whatever?

[18:52] <lanny> So my next question is how do I make 'class Pair is also' lexical so any tests that run after my test don't have Pairs with a car() and cdr() method? :)

[18:53] <lanny> Oh wait.  Silly question.  Forget I asked it.

[18:56] <[particle]> limbic_region: pugs bombs at ext\Set\t\basic.t, but smoke continues

[19:05] <fglock> nothingmuch: this is my new emitter prototype - I think we are working in the same problem - http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6/lib/Pugs/Emitter/Perl6/Perl5/

[19:06] <nothingmuch> i don't think the ast i'm trying to represent is easily parsable

[19:06] <nothingmuch> but i will probably much prefer using your stuff than PPI

[19:06] <nothingmuch> the fact that PPI is just a glorified tokenizer really made me sad

[19:47] *** peteso joined
[19:49] <gaal> is there a way to hint the parser about what class a method signature is for, so that member params can be checked for existence?

[19:49] <gaal> oh, maybe not, AUTO*...

[19:49] <gaal> but I can certainly imagine that under some strictures I'd want :($.elk) to parsefail

[19:50] <gaal> if I didn't have an $.elk attrib

[19:50] <peteso> I've been reading and following the parrot and pugs projects since their inceptions, I'd like to get involved and actually contribute something, any suggestions?

[19:50] <gaal> peteso: sure! tests are a great way to learn Perl 6 and help a lot with the effort

[19:51] *** integral is now known as constant

[19:51] *** integral joined
[19:51] <gaal> depending on what you already know / what you wish to get into, there are many things in the TASKS file you could pick up

[19:51] <peteso> is that help writing the testsuites or what?

[19:51] <gaal> do you know haskell? would you like to learn it?

[19:51] <peteso> I know a bit and yes, I am trying to learn it further

[19:52] <gaal> peteso: yup. we have over 11k tests and counting

[19:52] <gaal> and we'll need several times that(!)

[19:52] <gaal> look in the t/ directory under pugs

[19:52] <peteso> the canonical perl6 spec I suppose

[19:52] *** integral joined
[19:53] <gaal> oh, a great way to get into things is to visit http://spec.pugscode.org/

[19:53] <lambdabot> Title: Official Perl 6 Documentation

[19:53] <gaal> as you read the synopses there, you'll see some of them are linked to tests

[19:54] <gaal> eg: http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Lexical_Conventions and click on - Show the snippet from t/syntax/unicode.t

[19:54] <lambdabot> Title: S02, http://tinyurl.com/kz7ga

[19:54] <gaal> on happy days this even shows actual *results* of these tests

[19:55] <gaal> so, as you read, you can tell what parts of the spec are well-covered and what aren't.

[19:55] <gaal> sometimes you'll find things actually have tests for tehm, but those aren't linked to the spec

[19:55] <peteso> spiffy..

[22:11] <fglock> it could even implement this in XS

[22:12] <fglock> I'm almost-seriously considering a p5 compiler

[22:16] <obra> it would be interesting for perl's parser to get refactored... o O { And defined in Perl 5}

[22:18] <obra> fglock: are you on p5p?

[22:18] <fglock> no

[22:18] <obra> it might be interesting to talk to p5p about what sorts of things could help make v6 work even better.

[22:19] <Limbic_Region> is there a way to limit the arbitrary precision of ghc

[22:20] <fglock> obra: I need to find this out first - there are some things that I don't know if they are possible

[22:20] <Limbic_Region> there are some number tests that are failing because Perl wants a NaN or Inf or some such

[22:20] <fglock> like anonymous namespaces

[22:20] <Limbic_Region> and ghc is just happily calculating the answer

[22:22] <fglock> obra: I'll find out with audreyt during yapc::sa

[22:24] <[particle]> Limbic_Region: i find it funny that ghc seems to have a numeric value for Inf in those tests :)

[22:32] <TimToady> occasionally I wish I knew something about P5 internals, but then the fit passes...

[22:32] <obra> timtoady++

[22:33] <dakkar> what did SKID stan for?

[22:33] <TimToady> whatever you like, but mostly "safe key ID"

[22:34] <TimToady> which nobody could remember anyway...

[22:34] <dakkar> oh. something like a content hash, or the memory location?

[22:34] <dakkar> meaning, unique across all objects, or not?

[22:35] <TimToady> depends on whether the object type thinks of itself as a value type.

[22:35] <TimToady> all versions of 2 have the same identity, if not the same memory address.

[22:35] <TimToady> it's meaningless to ask "which 2"

[22:36] <dakkar> right

[22:36] <TimToady> but "WHICH $dog" makes much more sense

[22:37] <dakkar> a friend of mine once wrote a language where number literals were, in fact, constructing instances of numbers... so that you could say 'increment 0'

[22:37] <dakkar> not that it did any good

[22:37] * dakkar has strange friends

[22:38] <dakkar> which reminds me... prototype ("undef") objects are road only, right?

[22:38] *** dakkar is now known as dakkar_plus_1

[22:38] *** justatheory_ joined
[22:39] <TimToady> depends on where they are.

[22:39] <TimToady> my Dog $spot .= new;

[22:39] *** dakkar_plus_1 is now known as dakkar

[22:39] <TimToady> puts a prototype into $spot and then calls its new mutatingly.

[22:40] <TimToady> and that gives it a different WHICHness.

[22:41] <TimToady> it doesn't destroy the prototypical Dog's WHICHness.

[22:41] <TimToady> Dog.WHICH === Dog.WHICH

[22:41] <dakkar> ok. but to change the state of the prototype object I assume would require trickery

[22:41] <TimToady> Dog.WHICH !=== Cat.WHICH

[22:42] <TimToady> It's really just a placeholder for the real object that replaces it.

[22:42] <TimToady> the prototype itself never changes

[22:42] <TimToady> if you said Dog .= new it'd fail, I expect.

[22:43] <dakkar> so if I want all new dogs to have orange eyebrows, I have to change the Dog class (directly or indirectly)

[22:43] <TimToady> yes

[22:44] <TimToady> though I suppose even this is negotiable at some level.  but we won't tell anyone that.

[22:45] <dakkar> I think many people were impressed by the mutability of undef in Perl5, as shown in Birmingham

[22:45] <TimToady> someone at YAPC::EU just gave a lightning talk that P5's undef was insufficiently undefined.

[22:45] <dakkar> I was there ;-)

[22:55] <TimToady> what I ?evaled right after it.

[22:56] <dakkar> what about "splat" hashes?

[22:56] <markstos> Sorry, missed that. I didn't realize [,] @x was working yet. Cool.

[22:57] <TimToady> oddly, though *@x should parsefail, *(@x) should not.

[22:57] <TimToady> It should attempt to apply .(@x) to the Whatever object.

[22:57] <dakkar> argh

[22:57] <TimToady> which will likely fail.

[22:58] <dakkar> I should really re-read the synopses... too much has changed since the last time I did

[22:58] <TimToady> [,] is the new splat.  * in sigs only means "slurpy" now.

[22:58] <dakkar> so a hash in list context evals to a list of pairs

[22:59] <TimToady> yeah...they change just about every time I read them...  ;)

[23:00] <markstos> TimToady: would you mind helping me find where "my $a1 = my    $b1 = 42;" is spec'ed (having "my" appear on the RHS?)

[23:01] <TimToady> well, as audrey said, it's not, except in the "like P5" sense.

[23:02] <TimToady> so I'll have to read that part of the synopses and see if they change.  :)_

[23:02] <pasteling> "[particle]" at 144.81.84.173 pasted "synopsis results for C<ack --perl "=\s*my">" (5 lines, 190B) at http://sial.org/pbot/19676

[23:03] <markstos> I see. I actually didn't realize that worked in Perl 5, until I tried it just now. It's rather uncommon.

[23:11] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[[("a" => 1), ("b" => 2)] ] Bool::True

[23:12] <dakkar> this one is correct?

[23:13] <TimToady> oh, I see the problem.  my %h={...} is incorrect

[23:13] <markstos> it should parsefail?

[23:13] <dakkar> another thing that changed when I wasn't looking? ;-)

[23:13] <markstos> I thought {} was a hash constuctor

[23:13] <TimToady> should give a warning about odd number of elements, I suppose.

[23:13] <dakkar> ?

[23:13] <markstos> 4 is odd?

[23:14] <dakkar> we are missing somenthig

[23:14] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*@a) { say @a.perl}; my %h = (a=>1,b=>2);foo([,] %h)

[23:14] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[[("a" => 1), ("b" => 2)] ] Bool::True

[23:14] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = (a=>1,b=>2);foo([,] %h)

[23:14] <markstos> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = (a=>1,b=>2);foo([,] %h)

[23:14] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{} ] Bool::True

[23:15] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{} ] Bool::True

[23:15] <dakkar> ok, I'm going to dinner now. see you tomorrow

[23:15] <TimToady> myself I need to go fetch the laundry...

[23:15] <TimToady> biab &

[23:16] <markstos> If Perl 6 doesn't have references why would the difference between () and {} make a difference there ?

[23:17] <TimToady> because () behaves differently in list than in scalar context.

[23:17] <TimToady> in list context they're a no-op

[23:17] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = a=>1,b=>2;foo([,] %h)

[23:17] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{} ] Bool::True

[23:17] <TimToady> same bug. :)

[23:17] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = {a=>1,b=>2};foo([,] %h)

[23:18] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{} ] Bool::True

[23:18] <TimToady> it's possible that hash assignment is now smart enough to recognize a hash in the list and unpack it.

[23:18] <markstos> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = (a=>1,b=>2); say %h.perl ; foo([,] %h)

[23:18] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{("a" => 1), ("b" => 2)} {} ] Bool::True

[23:19] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = {a=>1,b=>2},'x','X';foo([,] %h)

[23:19] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{} ] Bool::True

[23:19] <markstos> ?eval sub foo(*%x) { say %x.perl}; my %h = {a=>1,b=>2}; say %h.perl ; foo([,] %h)

[23:19] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[{("a" => 1), ("b" => 2)} {} ] Bool::True

[23:19] <TimToady> ?eval sub foo(*@a) { say @a.perl}; my %h = {a=>1,b=>2},'x','X';foo([,] %h)

[23:19] <markstos> Yep, () and {} seem the same in these cases.

[23:19] <evalbot_r13276> OUTPUT[[("a\t1" => ("b" => 2)), ("x" => "X")] ] Bool::True

[23:20] <TimToady> no, it's not smart enough to do that *and* handle the pairs, apparently...

[23:20] <TimToady> well, laundry really &
