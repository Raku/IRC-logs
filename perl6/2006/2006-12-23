[03:45] <dduncan> seen TimToady

[03:45] *** luqui joined
[03:45] <dduncan> so, are we adding a Char type, or is your latest p6l post have a mistake in it?

[03:46] <dduncan> and if we do add it, does that correspond to a single character or to a string of characters?

[03:46] <dduncan> I don't see a mention in synopsis 6

[03:47] *** wolv is now known as wolverian

[03:47] <TimToady> all I'm saying is that if there is a Char type, it gets treated as Str.

[03:48] <dduncan> so it is hypothetical then

[03:49] <TimToady> yes, it's the abstract container of the largest possible character in the current Unicode level.

[03:49] <dduncan> also ...

[03:50] <TimToady> If you say .chars, it's the count of those abstractions.

[03:50] <dduncan> I suggest that adding such a type, though it could be named Text instead, could be useful for parity ...

[03:50] <dduncan> that is, it may be useful to both have distinct types for character strings vs bit strings, plus an additional type which can represent both

[03:50] <TimToady> Text implies bigger than Char to me

[03:51] <dduncan> the third type would then be the immutable version of what Buf is, which represents both, afaik

[03:51] <dduncan> eg, Str could cover both

[03:51] <TimToady> bit strings are Buf variants, and Bufs are abstractly composed of integers

[03:51] <dduncan> okay

[03:52] <dduncan> so maybe we already went over this and there is nothing to change?

[03:52] <TimToady> don't really think so.

[03:53] <dduncan> fyi, while I can live with Str meaning characters, I prefer something like Text or Char for that, with Str being more generic, as that is how I think

[03:53] <TimToady> subset Char of Str where { .chars == 1 };

[03:53] <dduncan> I see, it is a single character ...

[03:54] <dduncan> makes sense, so we have parity with the bit vs blob distinction

[03:54] <dduncan> we have char vs str

[03:54] <dduncan> capitalize the above

[04:00] <dduncan> TimToady, what time is it where you are?  By my reading, your email was sent a half-hour in the future.

[04:00] <dduncan> 2:29pm -08:00

[04:00] <dduncan> er, 8:29

[04:01] <allbery_b> @time TimToady

[04:01] <lambdabot> Local time for TimToady is Fri Dec 22 20:01:17 2006

[04:01] <dduncan> I see, so the email got its stamp elsewhere, which was wrong

[04:01] <TimToady> strange.  svnbot I guess, but then it shouldn't be marked PST

[06:39] <luqui> jrockway, no

[06:46] <luqui> TimToady, so you made that easy again?

[06:47] <TimToady> ?eval my $bar = 'chars'; "foo".$bar

[06:47] <evalbot_r14933> 3

[06:47] <luqui> didn't you have a good argument for unifying all of it/

[06:47] <TimToady> .$() should work too, but doesn't

[06:47] <jrockway> so is the hyper case specced?

[06:47] <TimToady> again?

[06:47] <jrockway> that could be fun when a method call modifies the object

[06:48] <luqui> i mean under ::()

[06:49] <TimToady> hyper is specced for methods, but only considering .foo as a postfix

[06:49] <TimToady> by itself . is not an operator

[06:49] <TimToady> there is no >>.<< 

[06:49] <jrockway> too bad :) don't know when I would use that, though

[06:50] <luqui> my ($a, $b, $c) = ($A, $B, $C)>>.<<<a b c>

[06:50] <TimToady> part of why we allowed ."foo" is that it prefers prefix:, so ."+" means apply prefix + as postfix.

[06:50] <luqui> i.e. shorthand for doing several things that have nothing in common but the dot ;-)

[06:51] <jrockway> luqui: that returns a list of lists

[06:51] <jrockway> (($A.a, $A.b, ..),($B.a,...),...

[06:51] <luqui> are you sure?

[06:51] <jrockway> well, it doesn't exist

[06:51] <luqui> ($A, $B, $C)X.X<a b c> would...

[06:51] <jrockway> hmmm

[06:51] * luqui needs to look over the new hyper spec

[06:52] <jrockway> you're right

[06:52] <jrockway> well, actually

[06:52] <jrockway> <a b c> X_X <a b c> == <aa bb cc>, right

[06:52] <jrockway> btw, i love the X_X operator

[06:53] <jrockway> i hope we can have the ^_^ and T_T operators too :)

[06:53] <TimToady> there is no _ operator either

[06:53] <jrockway> isn't that the example in the synopsis?

[06:54] <TimToady> what do you think _ is?

[06:54] <jrockway> concatenate strings?

[06:54] <TimToady> not for about 3 years now...

[06:54] <TimToady> it is ~ for that

[06:55] <jrockway> ahh

[06:55] <TimToady> and <a b c> X~X <a b c> would not be <aa bb cc>

[06:55] <jrockway> aa ab ac ba bb bc ...

[06:55] <jrockway> got it...

[06:55] <TimToady> <a b c> >>~<< <a b c> would be that

[06:56] <TimToady> and X is short for X~X

[06:57] <jrockway> i need a new "periodic table of the operators" :)

[06:58] <TimToady> we need a new table of the operators periodically.  :)
