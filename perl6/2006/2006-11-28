[00:34] <Juerd> Could be trains. Let's hope not.

[00:46] * [particle] perks up

[00:46] <pmichaud> I have a question about t/01-sanity/07-tailcall.t

[00:46] <pmichaud> 07-tailcall.t has the line:       &baz.goto("param1", "param2");

[00:46] <[particle]> deja vu

[00:46] <audreyt> [particle]: heya. tree transformation with MP6.

[00:46] <pmichaud> it's pretty obvious what this does, but is the 'goto' method defined anywhere in the Synopses?

[00:46] *** buetow joined
[00:47] <[particle]> audreyt: yes!

[00:48] <audreyt> pmichaud: I believe not; &baz.call(\("param1", "param2")) is the specced form though it doesn't explicitly tailcall

[00:48] <[particle]> pm: i think we've concluded the answer is 'no'. the question becomes, is this syntax legal?

[00:49] <pmichaud> well, the syntax is legal, it's just a question of whether the method exists or not :-)

[00:49] <audreyt> pmichaud: you can safely replace it with a .call and a \() capture literal

[00:49] <pmichaud> audreyt: what should 07-tailcall.t be testing, then?  i.e., what sanity is it checking?

[00:49] <audreyt> or just do &baz("param1", "param2") 

[00:50] *** loumz joined
[00:50] <audreyt> oh wait, that can't do

[00:50] <[particle]> do you need capture syntax for Test.pm?

[00:50] <audreyt> [particle]: no

[00:50] <audreyt> pmichaud: it's testing tailcall optimization

[00:50] <audreyt> the idea of .goto is that it's replacing perl5's 

[00:50] <audreyt> goto &foo

[00:50] <[particle]> well then, i don't see a need for it in sanity tests

[00:50] <audreyt> which we need a replacement anyway

[00:50] <pmichaud> would we lose anything by taking it out of 01-sanity?

[00:50] <audreyt> nope. please rm ahead.

[00:50] <[particle]> audreyt: goto &$AUTOLOAD is referenced in S10, so if the syntax changes that needs update

[00:51] <audreyt> or mv, as the case may be

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> mv to unspecced ?

[00:51] <pmichaud> audreyt: excellent, many thanks

[00:51] <audreyt> [particle]: not at all.

[00:51] <audreyt> [particle]: look at context again

[00:51] <audreyt> ""Perl 5's goto &$AUTOLOAD..."

[00:51] <[particle]> ah, well that's what i get for not paying attention

[00:52] <audreyt> so, tree transformation.

[00:52] * [particle] hopes pmichaud sticks around

[00:52] <audreyt> relevant chapters: S06:1177

[00:52] <pmichaud> I'll stick around if I can -- family is interrupting at times :-|

[00:53] <audreyt> all the way till :1211 or so

[00:53] <pmichaud> but I'll keep the log open :-)

[00:53] <audreyt> that is the matching part. the construction part in MP6 is

[00:53] <audreyt> ::Tree(left => ..., right => ...)

[00:53] <audreyt> fglock advocates that we use explicit :$left in matching part

[00:54] <audreyt> sub f (::Tree(:$left, :$right)) {...}

[00:54] <audreyt> which has this good property that construction and deconstruction looks the same.

[00:54] <audreyt> cf. ML and its descendents

[00:54] <audreyt> which is ideal (designed for) tree transformations, I hope

[00:54] <audreyt> any particular questions about the syntax, semantics or pragmatics?

[00:55] <[particle]> as an aside, i think the syns need s/\t/        /g translation

[01:12] <audreyt> >1G?

[01:13] <TreyHarris> no, 400M about

[01:14] <audreyt> oh. that's fine

[01:15] <diotalevi> So does anyone here have an idea how I can type << in emacs and have « inserted instead? There's an abbrev-mode but it appears to only work if the shortcut is word-like which << isn't.

[01:16] <Chewie[]> I'd almost just do something like A<< to trigger the insertion.

[01:16] <Chewie[]> unless that fails too.

[01:16] <eviltwin_b> take a look at iso-accents-mode

[01:17] <eviltwin_b> you can define your own accents, IIRC

[01:19] <Tene> diotalevi: in vim, I have << mapped to «.  I also have my caps lock key set to act as 'compose', so I can hit caps, <, < anywhere and have « inserted

[01:19] <Tene> setting a compose key is probably the most widely-useful solution

[01:20] <diotalevi> I don't know what a "compose key" is.

[01:20] <Tene> diotalevi: what Desktop Environment are you using?

[01:21] <diotalevi> Windows XP, and Gnome. *Currently* Gnome.

[01:22] <Tene> in gnome, system->preferences->keyboard

[01:22] <Tene> 'Layout Options' tab, 'Compose key position' section

[01:22] <eviltwin_b> with stock iso-accents-mode ~< is « and ~> is »

[01:23] <diotalevi> Aha, thanks eviltwin_b. Strangely, it displays like {<<}, not the « I expected.

[01:24] <eviltwin_b> that suggests it doesn't know how to display «.  you may need to tweak something somewhere but I'm not sure how to do it for fsfemacs (I use xemacs)

[01:25] <eviltwin_b> (and unfortunately xemacs and fsfemacs have diverged quite a bit)

[01:25] <diotalevi> Like I said, it's odd. I can do ucs-insert to say « and that works fine. It displays nicely and everything.

[01:27] <eviltwin_b> hm.  it works as expected here --- but again, xemacs.  and probably with some customization I've forgotten but could dig up

[01:54] *** bonesss joined
[01:59] <diotalevi> I just found that the iso-accent-mode thing I was pointed a before is now considered obsolete. Current state of the art is to switch into an "input method" mode where typing ~< and ~> becomes « and » respectively.

[01:59] *** scsibug joined
[01:59] <diotalevi> That's the latin-1 input method anyway.

[02:00] <diotalevi> Or.... with the utf-8 mode then &<< becomes «.

[02:00] <diotalevi> Hmm.

[02:01] <eviltwin_b> not surprising.  emacs' handling of non-ascii is still evolving

[02:01] <eviltwin_b> unfortunately, it also still sucks pretty badly :>

[02:02] <diotalevi> It says it's following rfc1345.

[06:26] <diotalevi_> Are there any unicode operators other than «, », and ¥? Why is "zip" using the yen symbol anyway? It seems weird that it's using a currency symbol.

[06:28] <Tene> well... « is "much less than" in mathematics.

[06:29] <Tene> just as < is "less than".

[06:29] <Tene> So is it weird to use a mathematical comparison operator for quoting lists?

[06:29] <TimToady> actually, that's a separate character in Unicode: ≪

[06:30] <Tene> Hmm.

[06:30] <TimToady> ¥ is used only for its picture of a zipper.

[21:17] <Tainted`> can i use this chan for perl help?

[21:17] <PerlJam> Are you using perl6?

[21:17] <Limbic_Region> Tainted` - not really

[21:17] <Limbic_Region> Tainted` - you likely want #perl

[21:17] <Tainted`> know any good servers i can get perl help?

[21:17] <Tainted`> ok

[21:17] <PerlJam> try #perl or #perlhelp

[21:17] <Tainted`> thx
