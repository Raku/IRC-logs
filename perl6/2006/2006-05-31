[06:27] <cmarcelo> audreyt: people freaked out about opensource licenses =P

[06:29] <Alias_> ?

[06:30] <cmarcelo> i was introducing HsJudy (judy bindings for haskell) to haskell people and suddenly they were talking about whether (L)GPL was really open source etc..

[06:31] <Alias_> ah

[06:31] <Alias_> :)

[06:31] *** qu1j0t3 joined
[06:33] <audreyt> cmarcelo: ignore them :)

[06:33] <audreyt> <- already spent one entire week of her life working out all LGPL ramifications with allison

[06:34] <audreyt> cmarcelo: it boils down to that as long as we still -ljudy, and release HsJudy with BSD license, there's nothing people should worry about.

[06:34] <audreyt> they can use HsJudy asif it's BSD

[06:35] <audreyt> and even if statically linked, their code still does not need to be redistributed in LGPL at all, and cn use whatever license as they see fit

[06:36] *** GeJ joined
[06:36] <cmarcelo> audreyt: great! and did you see Bulat's points on the project? i "summarized" his(?) points in HsJudy/TODO ...

[06:36] <GeJ> hello all

[06:39] <audreyt> yup, I saw those

[06:39] <audreyt> good points

[06:39] <audreyt> (bbiab)

[06:41] <cmarcelo> audreyt: the most critical thing (i think) is this StablePtr overhead...

[15:09] <Coke__> was just talking to the author of Readonly - is something like this going to be in core p6 ?

[15:10] *** penk joined
[15:17] <Alias_> what a stupid name

[15:17] <Alias_> he should have lowercased it :(

[15:18] *** Qiang joined
[15:19] <Juerd> Alias_: Wrap it :)

[15:19] <obra> Alias_: how's Task::Warn?

[15:19] <Alias_> wha?

[15:19] <Coke__> lowercase is reserved for pragmas. That's not a pragma.

[15:19] <Alias_> obra: What would that do?

[15:19] <Juerd> Alias_: Is this Task:: related to xmath's Task module?

[15:19] <Juerd> Coke__: It's not reserved.

[15:19] <Coke__> hang on.

[15:20] <Juerd> Coke__: It's also used for cute syntax with "use".

[15:20] <Juerd> use again 'Foo::Bar';

[15:20] <obra> er

[15:20] <obra> sorry

[15:20] <obra> Task::Weaken

[15:20] <obra> brain dropping syllables

[15:20] <Alias_> Well it's written...

[15:20] <Alias_> :)

[15:21] <Alias_> No feedback from downstream yet, but only PPI is using it so far

[15:21] <Coke__>  -> (11:20) Private message from Sue D. Nymme [bananas], to Coke:

[15:21] <Coke__>  - ... honestly, because I thought it was pretentious of me to think that it

[15:21] <Coke__>  - would ever rise to the level of a pragma.

[15:21] *** justatheory joined
[15:22] <obra> I was contemplating using it.

[15:22] <obra> The Task:: namespace scares me a little bit, thogh

[15:22] <Alias_> That's only because it's new

[15:22] <Alias_> But you may well want to wait a little bit and see what happens

[15:23] <Alias_> This stuff tends to take months to shake out, as the fallout cascades downstream

[15:23] <Alias_> And Task:: is just a modernised Bundle::

[15:24] <Coke__> anyway, back to my original question - is Readonly going to be a core thing in perl6? I fully admit to not having kept up with the apoc/exe/syn.

[15:25] <obra> Alias_: sure. that's why I mention it.

[15:25] <Alias_> obra: Well, there'll be Module::Install edge cases

[15:25] <Alias_> But I'm not sure of any major cases

[15:25] <Alias_> But I'm not willing to attest to that until PITA is up and running

[15:27] <obra> understood

[15:28] <Alias_> But it doesn't do anything in this first release that you couldn't replace with your own tests for the presence of weaken, for now

[15:28] <Alias_> Not in the first release anyway

[15:28] <obra> Yeah, but it's all about a build-time dependency

[15:29] <Alias_> ?

[15:30] <obra> Sorry. "I need to fail 'perl Makefile.PL' unless weaken is present"

[15:30] <Alias_> obra: Yes, I need to :)

[15:30] <obra> Yeah. You beat me to implementation by about a day

[15:30] <obra> Except, I was going to call it Scalar::Util::Weaken

[15:30] * Alias_ nods

[15:30] <Alias_> I didn't feel it was worthy of that

[15:31] <obra> *nod*

[15:31] <obra> That seemed to be the easiest way to possibly have graham absorb it later

[15:31] <Alias_> aaahhh

[15:31] <Alias_> ok

[15:31] <Alias_> I didn't see the thing in P5P until after though

[15:31] <Alias_> I had my own issues with Dapper

[15:31] <Alias_> Which trigger doing it

[15:31] <Alias_> triggered

[15:31] <obra> *nod*

[15:31] <Alias_> And RedHat... sigh

[15:32] <obra> I've seen it in other non-linux places too

[15:32] *** Coke__ left
[15:32] <Alias_> I've seen them come and go in single releases a few times in other distros

[15:32] <Alias_> It's a fairly safe call that it would be all over the place

[15:33] <obra> I've seen it on a lot of badly maintained local perls

[15:33] <obra> (We get a lot of that with RT)

[15:33] * Alias_ nods

[15:33] <Alias_> On the absorbing thing though, I think I went with the "better to stay out of his way altogether"

[15:33] <Alias_> ... logic

[15:34] <rgs> hmm distros
