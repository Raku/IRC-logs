[08:23] <nothingmuch> chromatic: in case you backlog

[08:24] <nothingmuch> separating to layers is not separating to parts, IMHO

[08:24] <nothingmuch> the standard library and the prelude are not separate parts

[08:24] <nothingmuch> they are the same part

[08:24] <nothingmuch> except that it's slightly more organized

[08:24] <nothingmuch> the linker/compiler/parser/emitter yadda stuff is, again, componentization

[08:25] <nothingmuch> the idea here is to simpolify the design, try to make it more reusable, and refactor it a bit

[08:25] <nothingmuch> pugs is already taking this route

[08:25] <nothingmuch> i suspect that given organic growth Perl 6 in Perl 6 will also do that

[08:25] <nothingmuch> all I'm interested is in helping this process happen by deciding to do this intentionally, together, as a community

[08:25] <nothingmuch> instead of by accident, each person on her or his own

[08:26] <nothingmuch> since the latter process tends to actually raise the barrier for community participation

[08:26] <nothingmuch> raise programmer burn out

[08:26] <nothingmuch> raise the complexity of the whole project from a maintenance and implementation point of view

[08:26] <nothingmuch> and so on and so forth

[08:26] <nothingmuch> my conjecture is this: organization *MUST* happen

[08:26] <nothingmuch> and: we already know what the big parts are going to be

[08:27] <nothingmuch> (must happen eventually)

[08:27] <nothingmuch> given these two claims, I think it's safe to say that there is no harm in trying to be a little more prepared for change

[08:27] <nothingmuch> making the trial and error process more focused and clean

[14:06] <nothingmuch> see you all on feb 19th

[14:06] <nothingmuch> gaal, audreyt: FYI you're getting comaint on all my modules in case I die

[14:06] <nothingmuch> stevan too

[14:06] <wolverian> er, huh?

[14:06] <nothingmuch> snowboarding =)

[14:06] <stevan> ah

[14:06] <stevan> enjoy

[14:06] <wolverian> ah :)

[14:06] <wolverian> have fun

[14:07] <nothingmuch> =D

[14:07] <nothingmuch> maybe i'll have netaccess in the airport etc

[14:07] <nothingmuch> but probably not there

[14:10] <Juerd> faxmodem++

[14:11] <Juerd> nothingmuch: Good luck

[14:11] <Juerd> nothingmuch: Break a leg, and no more than that :)

[14:11] <Juerd> With a broken leg you have a good excuse to:

[14:11] <Juerd> a) not go to $work

[14:11] <Juerd> b) hack, hack, hack

[16:35] <gaal> so, if we transition to FPS, should this still hold?

[16:35] <gaal> type RuleParser a = GenParser Char RuleState a

[16:36] <gaal> since that implies the input is [Char]

[16:37] <gaal> Or does a transition to FPS (therefore?) require deeper hackage in Parsec?

[16:46] <bsb> frames per second?

[16:47] <bsb> you doing macros gaal?

[16:48] <spinclad> purl: FPS?

[16:48] <gaal> bsb: FastPackedString - http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps/Data.FastPackedString.html

[16:48] <spinclad> (FPS is FastPackedString)

[16:49] <gaal> Or will we be transitioning to Text.Parser stuff? (Oh great. Monads weren't enough :-)

[16:51] <integral> gaal: deeper parsec hacking I believe

[16:52] <integral> gaal: My first idea is to investigate if parsec's _interface_ can be put atop Text.Parser.Rule,  but maybe not since you have to do a monad -> arrow conversion type thing :-/

[16:52] <integral> gaal: you'd probably have to rewrite the GenParser type since your parser will no longer be general enough to parse [a] in general :)

[16:53] <gaal> is there any practical use of an [a] parser at all?

[16:54] <integral> Yes in general,  in pugs, no,  at least not in Pugs.Parser.

[16:56] <bsb> So a normal String is just a list and FPS is a chunk of memory?

[16:56] <gaal> bsb: yes. and "just a list" is lazy.
