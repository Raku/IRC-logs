[04:21] <aufrank> the archives linked to in the PDL FAQ don't have any messages after 2004, so I wasn't able to get any sense ahead of time about what's going on in PDL development right now

[04:21] <aufrank> so I had to sort of cold call them

[04:21] <aufrank> good to know it came out alright :)

[04:44] <TimToady> audreyt, patrick: when we derive a new grammar on the fly, we need some way of deriving the bits of grammar that are in hashes like %statement_control.

[04:44] <TimToady> I wonder if <%.statement_control> is sufficient...

[04:45] <TimToady> Or whether we need some official way of wrapping a parent class's hash and adding extra values.

[04:46] <TimToady> virtualizing the % name is a step in the right direction, but I'm not sure how one would go about memoizing that...

[04:48] <TimToady> and one would have to be very careful to keep consistent longest token semantics even with <%.statement_control|%.prefix|%.term>

[04:48] <TimToady> since there's no guarantee that the longest token comes from the most derived grammar.

[09:55] <nnunley> Wee.  FPS has been incorperated into the Haskell base 1.0

[09:56] <theorbtwo> Wow, that's horrible.  The first thing that came to my mind was the FPS easter egg in some versions of MS Office.
