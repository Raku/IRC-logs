[15:32] <pmurias> hi

[15:33] *** mAdzzzzzz is now known as GabrielVieira

[15:34] <pmurias> fglock: what would me the prefered way for automatic handling of compilation for MP6

[15:35] <pmurias> would a simple script which writes a Makefile be the right approach?

[15:35] <svnbot6> r14827 | fglock++ | MP6-parrot - added 'ternary:<?? ::>'

[15:39] <GnuVince> fglock: what is ternary:<?? ::>?  Hasn't it been renamed to ternary:<?? !!>?

[15:40] <[particle]> GnuVince: in parrot, it's ?? ::

[15:40] <GnuVince> [particle]: Ok.  What's the reason for this difference?

[15:40] <[particle]> he's working on the parrot emitter, so there are parrot constructs

[15:41] <[particle]> GnuVince: when the op was created in parrot, it was called ?? :: in perl6

[15:41] <[particle]> p6spec changed

[15:41] <[particle]> parrot impl didn't

[15:41] <[particle]> ...which is fine. parrot's not *just* for perl6

[15:41] <fglock> GnuVince: sorry, it's ?? !!

[15:41] <GnuVince> Okay.

[15:42] <fglock> pmurias: not sure yet, since we are dealing with multiple languages

[15:42] <GnuVince> So in Perl6, the classical C ternary operator (?:) is ternary:<?? !!>, but in Parrot it's ternary:<?? ::>?

[15:43] <[particle]> actually, i misspoke. in parrot it's 'if'

[15:43] <[particle]> well, it's labels

[15:43] <[particle]> there's no 'if' statement in pir/pasm

[15:44] <[particle]> i need a little wake-me-up

[15:45] <Juerd> [particle]: WAKE UP!!!!

[15:45] <lambdabot> Juerd: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[15:45] <Juerd> lambdabot: Great.

[15:45] <Juerd> It'd be useful if the bot just sent email :)

[15:47] <svnbot6> r14828 | fglock++ | MP6 - fixed ternary:<?? !!> spelling - GnuVince++

[15:49] <fglock> pmurias: how about a 'mp6.pl' script that calls the backend-specific scripts

[15:49] <fglock> and makes appropriate command-line switch processing

[15:51] <fglock> particle: would you take a look at 'For'? I don't know how to handle iterating through an array

[15:54] <fglock> oops - how do you revert a commit on a single file?

[15:55] <TimToady> I note that it's also ternary<?? ::> in v6/v6-MiniPerl6-MO/lib/MiniPerl6/Grammar.pm and Perl5/Emitter.pm

[15:56] <fglock> TimToady: that's fixed

[15:56] <TimToady> not in 828

[15:57] <fglock> how can I revert r14828 ? I made a bad mistake

[15:57] <fglock> I committed from the wrong terminal

[15:58] <[particle]> svn up -r 14827

[15:58] <[particle]> then merge to head

[15:59] <rindolf> Hi all.

[15:59] <rindolf> Hi TimToady

[16:00] <fglock> [particle]: svk says that there are conflicts, and doesn't do anything

[16:01] <fglock> use '--force' ?

[16:02] <jamessan> svn merge -r14828:$last_good_rev

[16:03] <pmurias> fglock: meant to say 'of'

[16:03] <[particle]> fglock: sorry, not an svk user :(

[16:04] <clkao> fglock: svk merge -c -14828 //mirror/pugs //mirror/pugs

[16:04] <clkao> but you need to pick your local revision

[16:06] <fglock> clkao: I get a 'commit message' editor with no file list

[16:06] <jamessan> clkao: aha, -c is handy. nice tip

[16:06] * [particle] wishes -c worked on words like PREV and HEAD

[16:06] <fglock> pmurias: compilation of mp6 is tricky, it can destroy the image - it would be nice to have a script that checked if the compilation went well

[16:07] <clkao> fglock:try -C first

[16:07] <clkao> -c -blah -C

[16:07] <clkao> jamessan: svn has -c as well, but svk has minus number which means revert

[16:08] <fglock> clkao: 'No such revision 14828'

[16:09] <clkao> svk log -r14828@

[16:09] <fglock> clkao: would you do the revert for me? to 14827

[16:09] <clkao> i don't have a working pugs checkout right now. it's not another box

[16:09] <clkao> fglock: you need to find your local revision

[16:09] <clkao> or if you use trunk svk you can do -c -14828@ and don't hqve to worry about it

[16:10] <fglock> clkao: 'Filesystem has no item: File not found: revision 14827, path '/trunk/v6/v6-MiniPerl6' '

[16:10] <fglock> on svk log

[16:10] <[particle]> clkao: does svk info give you the local rev number?

[16:10] <clkao> yes

[16:11] *** diakopter joined
[16:11] <jamessan> clkao: svn has the minus number support too, at least according to --help

[16:11] <clkao> ah ok. they stolen everything from us. clever ;)

[16:11] <jamessan> heh

[16:12] <fglock> clkao: found it: 'r15701 (orig r14808)'

[16:12] <fglock> it's trunk svk

[16:12] <fglock> afaik

[16:13] <fglock> now 'svk merge -c 14828:14827' ?

[16:13] <clkao> ok, svk merge -c -15701 //mirror/pugs //mirror/pugs

[16:14] <clkao> wait, why does it show orig 14808 not 14828 ?

[16:14] <[particle]> because he pushed from the wrong wc?

[16:14] <clkao> how trunk ? can you do -c -14828@ //mirror/pugs //mirror/pugs ?

[16:15] <fglock> no - 'Change spec -14828@ not recognized'

[16:15] <fglock> should I do svk up -s first?

[16:17] <clkao> no, this is only supported in latest svk

[16:17] <clkao> svk log -r 14828@ //mirror/pugs ?

[16:18] <fglock>  'Can't find local revision for 14828 on /mirror/pugs

[16:19] <clkao> did you not commit 14828 from this svk ?

[16:19] <fglock> can I get the file from the web interface? it's a single file

[16:19] <fglock> clkao: no, I used another computer

[16:19] <fglock> with svn

[16:20] <fglock> maybe I should revert there?

[16:20] <clkao> so svk sync -a first

[16:21] <fglock> done
