[02:41] <schneiker> I'd like to help with Perl6, but don't have much spare time.

[02:41] <schneiker> In the course of searching for scattered Perl6 info,

[02:41] <schneiker> I thought about starting a "perl.perl6.using"

[02:41] <schneiker> group on Google Groups, with the following focus:

[02:41] <schneiker> "Information exchange for using Perl 6.

[02:41] <schneiker> The most useful info and resource links are added to a

[02:41] <schneiker> weekly-updated "Using Perl 6 FAQ" posting. Topics include:

[02:41] <schneiker> getting started with Perl 6, incremental migration from Perl 5,

[02:41] <schneiker> developing Perl 6 tools, what early adapters are doing, etc.

[02:41] <schneiker> Apparently I cannot do this directly through Google Groups.

[02:41] <schneiker> I get this error message: "This group name is not suitable.

[02:41] <schneiker> You cannot start a group name to be similar to a Usenet group."

[02:41] <schneiker> However my newserver doesn’t show "perl.perl6.*" as part of

[02:41] <schneiker> the Usenet newsgroup hierarchy (versus just in nttp.perl.org)

[02:41] <schneiker> My search efforts haven't turned up any helpful info.

[02:41] <schneiker> Information, feedback welcome.

[02:49] <FurnaceBoy_> 'similar' though

[02:49] <FurnaceBoy_> who knows what their actual rules are. Try not using  a '.'

[02:49] <FurnaceBoy_> just "Perl6 Users"

[02:49] <FurnaceBoy_> should be okay?

[02:50] <sanxiyn> Interesting to see Pugs relicensing. I use this license myself:

[02:50] <sanxiyn> http://sparcs.kaist.ac.kr/~tinuviel/fepy/COPYING

[02:50] <FurnaceBoy_> a.k.a. BSD

[02:50] <FurnaceBoy_> heh

[02:50] * FurnaceBoy_ is only joking

[02:50] <FurnaceBoy_> you could just say public domain

[02:51] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: It's more fun this way.

[02:51] <FurnaceBoy_> more swearing involved, if that's your  thing

[02:51] <sanxiyn> Official homepage of WTFPL is here: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/

[02:51] <FurnaceBoy_> I came across this one recently:

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * [email@hidden.address] wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_>  * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[02:52] <schneiker> "Perl6 Users" should be OK, but I'd like to see it grouped with other "perl.perl6.*"

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_> impossible schneiker.

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_> you could, however, propose an addition to Usenet.

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_> that would be about 100x more difficult however.

[02:52] <FurnaceBoy_> Usenet is a tree owned by root and not world writable;-)

[02:53] <FurnaceBoy_> and I think the rules are there to prevent exactly what you propose

[02:53] <FurnaceBoy_> if you want to augment Usenet, go through that procedure, but it will take longer

[02:53] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: alt.* hierarchy is easier to get in.

[02:53] <FurnaceBoy_> true.

[02:54] <FurnaceBoy_> but that wouldn't have the ring of officiality that schneiker seems to be pursuing.

[02:54] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: Big 8 needs voting.

[02:54] * FurnaceBoy_ notes 'officiality' isn't a word. sorry.

[02:54] <FurnaceBoy_> yes, I know.

[02:54] <FurnaceBoy_> depends on whether he wants quick'n'easy, or Usenet :)

[02:55] <sanxiyn> One can read http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/big-eight.html and start the process.

[02:55] <schneiker> I got Usenet to add comp.lang.ruby, years ago, but it took several months.

[02:55] <schneiker> However perl.perl6.* does not appear to be part of actual Usenet hierarchy.

[02:55] <schneiker> That's why I was puzzled.

[02:55] <FurnaceBoy_> whatever way you cut it, a random Google Group is easier. which is why there are a zillion of them.

[02:55] <sanxiyn> File RFD to news.announce.newsgroups...

[02:55] <FurnaceBoy_> find its owners schneiker

[02:55] <FurnaceBoy_> but I warn you, this way will take work and commitment

[02:56] <FurnaceBoy_> compared to opening a random GG

[02:56] <FurnaceBoy_> the result may be worth it ...

[02:56] <FurnaceBoy_> are there no perl6 groups in perl.* ?

[02:56] * FurnaceBoy_ goes looking

[02:56] <sanxiyn> I still prefer Yahoo! Groups to Google Groups actually.

[02:56] * FurnaceBoy_ only uses Usenet

[02:57] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: I also use Gmane.

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> ck

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> worst web interface ever.

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> :_)

[02:57] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: Well, it has NNTP too.

[02:57] * FurnaceBoy_ thanks Allah

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> I can;t believe nobody has called them on it

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> in all these years

[02:57] <FurnaceBoy_> maybe all the sane people just use NNTP

[02:58] *** Quell joined
[02:58] <sanxiyn> FurnaceBoy_: I only use search.gmane.org from the web interface.

[02:58] <FurnaceBoy_> schneiker, yeah, there seems an opening for a 'general' group under perl.perl6.*

[02:58] <sanxiyn> (Which I found to work better than Google for some cases.)

[02:58] <FurnaceBoy_> you could probably find a way to propose one.

[02:59] <aufrank> I'm pretty sure Larry mentioned something about being to able to help in getting that process off the ground

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> perl.perl6.using doesn't seem to have any precedent though... I mean 'using'

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> there must be a better word

[02:59] <aufrank> but I could be imagining things

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> yes, TimToady could surely help

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> if anyone can

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> schneiker, pounce on TimToady about this

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> but I suggest a better word than 'using'

[02:59] <FurnaceBoy_> general has precedents in Usenet

[03:01] <schneiker> FurnaceBoy: OK. I like general better.

[03:05] <schneiker> FurnaceBoy: Recommended means to "pounce on TimToady about this"?

[04:36] <spinclad> it seems the author doesn't see a natural or useful (or stable?) order to the keys, so doesn't provide iterators

[04:38] <spinclad> but if one needs to iterate, in an arbitrary order, a hash order should work

[04:38] <spinclad> so perhaps we may have something to contribute back to him...

[08:38] <audreyt> @($<foo>) means @($/.{'foo'})

[08:38] <audreyt> @($123) means @($/.[123])

[08:41] <audreyt>                     @data;

[08:42] <audreyt> if it's not a typo, then it needs to be clearly documented that whitespace-follows-block-literal means comma

[08:42] <audreyt> because you've specced that non-comma-follows-block-literal will no longer be arglist

[08:42] <audreyt> (S12, "it will be considered to be the final argument")

[08:43] <audreyt> map {moose}, .blah # map({moose}, $_.blah)

[12:30] <dakkar> it's Syck_stub.c, no .o

[12:30] <audreyt> I'm implementing the saner fix (move Data.Yaml.Syck to third-party)

[12:30] <audreyt> which is good, as it allows D.Y.S. be used separately

[12:30] <dakkar> ok, thanks again

[12:31] <audreyt> np :) thanks for reporting

[12:31] * dakkar is great at finding obscure bugs

[12:32] <dakkar> audreyt: while you are there, do you have any idea why I have to manually run «./Setup configure --user» to make it find fps?

[12:36] <audreyt> I believe it's a Cabal 1.1.3-specific thing :/

[12:36] *** trampel left
[12:37] <audreyt> try it again

[12:37] <dakkar> ok, I'll do it by hand

[12:37] <nnunley> audreyt: Could it be because the Pugs.cabal file doesn't refer to third-party?

[12:37] <audreyt> nope, try 10172

[12:38] <audreyt> nnunley: no... it's not that

[12:38] <audreyt> dakkar: r10172 should fix that

[12:38] <audreyt> (essentially by adding --user for you)

[12:38] <dakkar> ok

[12:38] <dakkar> I'm fixing a lot of whitespace-related parsefails, btw

[12:39] <svnbot6> r10172 | audreyt++ | * build_pugs: add --user.

[12:39] <audreyt> yay

[12:39] <Juerd> audreyt: I think the whitespace rules for . and .= should be the same, for consistency: no whitespace around .=, if it's also disallowed around .

[12:39] <audreyt> dakkar++ dakkar++

[12:39] <Juerd> Uglier, but easier to predict.

[12:39] <audreyt> er, uhm, hm, I thought the other way around.

[12:39] <audreyt> I see .= as infix

[12:39] <audreyt> not postfix-method

[12:39] <Juerd> Also, with .foo meaning $_.foo, I'd expect .=foo to mean $_.=foo; when it does not, it should probably not mean anything, and die with an appropriate error message.

[12:40] <Juerd> audreyt: .= is based on .

[12:40] <Juerd> Not on +=

[12:40] <Juerd> The RHS of .= is not a normal expression

[12:40] <audreyt> I think it is

[12:40] <Juerd> It is, like .'s RHS, a method name.

[12:40] <Juerd> i.e. bareword, or simple variable.

[12:40] <audreyt> when the pugs parser sees

[12:41] <audreyt> $_ .= ......

[12:41] <audreyt> it transforms it as

[12:41] <Juerd> I don't reason from a parser's point of view...

[12:41] <audreyt> $_ .= $_......

[12:41] <dakkar> audreyt: r10172 fixed the '--user'. now I only have the Syck_stub problem

[12:41] <audreyt> Juerd: I see your point

[12:42] <audreyt> my Dog $fido.=new;

[12:42] <audreyt> is what you mean

[12:42] <Juerd> That, and other things.

[12:42] <audreyt> I think it's a bit too draconian; we can easily fix the whitespace problem.

[12:42] <Juerd> Mostly, I'm worried about confusion if they different whitespace rules exist.

[12:42] <Juerd> I also think of it the other way around: if whitespace is allowed around .=, it should be allowed around .

[12:42] <audreyt> it is a normal infix macro... I think

[12:42] <Juerd> It's not a macro, I think.

[12:42] <audreyt> whilst as . is strictly postfix

[12:43] <audreyt> ok. we Think Differently

[12:43] <audreyt> that's fine :)

[12:43] <Juerd> It isn't just that $foo.=bar always translates to $foo = $foo.bar

[12:43] <svnbot6> r10173 | audreyt++ | * Beginning to implement HsSyck.

[12:43] <audreyt> it'd make $foo.=bar in the same cate as $foo.+bar

[12:43] <audreyt> instead of $foo += bar

[12:43] <dakkar> in enum.t: enum <<:Alpha<A> Bravo Charlie Delta Echo>>

[12:43] <Juerd> It could have to call the inline-optimized version of bar

[12:44] <Juerd> Of which I forgot the syntax :)

[12:44] <dakkar> gives a parsefail at the <A>

[12:44] <Juerd> audreyt: I think that would be a good solution

[12:44] <dakkar> changing it to enum <<:Alpha<<A>> Bravo Charlie Delta Echo>> works

[12:44] <audreyt> dakkar: a bug. fixing

[12:44] <Juerd> Gotta go; afk

[12:44] <dakkar> ok, so I won't touch the test

[15:03] <schneiker> TimToady:  What do you think about establishing Usenet comp.lang.perl6.general?

[15:03] <schneiker> (I did the Usenet registration process for comp.lang.ruby years ago.)

[15:03] <schneiker> I'd like to use it to accumulate material for a Perl6 Eary Adapter FAQ to be posted

[15:03] <schneiker> there weekly, with info and useful links, etc.

[15:04] <audreyt> people still use usenet? </troll>

[15:05] <Arathorn> google killed usenet :(

[15:05] <audreyt> (I think it's a good idea -- I did registraion for tw.bbs.religion.perl on, oh, 1996)

[15:05] <audreyt> it's been nearly 10 years, wow.

[15:06] <schneiker> Got to run to $work.

[15:06] <schneiker> Will check back evening PDT (actually AZ MST).

[15:06] <schneiker> audreyt: old habit, true, but also often handy way to focus searches.

[15:06] <schneiker> Arathorn: Perl NGs still get quite a bit of traffic.

[15:06] <Arathorn> schneiker: for sure. still, usenet could be much more alive if its archiving hadn't been butchered by google groups

[15:10] <FurnaceBoy> actually I don't think that's entirely true

[15:11] <FurnaceBoy> Google Groups would have given Usenet usage a large shot in the arm,

[15:11] <FurnaceBoy> but you can argue the wrong type of users (more eternal September)

[15:12] <FurnaceBoy> I see a lot of activity in the groups I hang in, anyway

[15:13] <audreyt> the last time I followed usenet actively

[15:13] <audreyt> was during the saga of Ellora at rec.game.roguelike.nethack

[15:13] *** mkhl joined
[15:13] <audreyt> that was a brilliant work.

[15:14] <avar> Arathorn: I thought AOL killed Usenet when it started the September of forever?

[15:14] <Arathorn> well, i'd argue that GG kills both markets - its UI was/is unusable for powerusers, and too daunting for AOLers

[15:14] *** mkhl left
[15:14] <avar> Arathorn: Why is it unusable?

[15:14] <avar> Arathorn: I've used it twice or thrice with good results.

[15:15] <avar> I managed to read & post to a popular newsgroup, google groups helped me to get from A to B => GG is good

[15:15] <Arathorn> broken threading, frames, broken posting, broken message-list syncing, non-proportional fonts, obfuscated message headers, etc.

[15:15] <Arathorn> the latter 2 points got fixed over the years, of course

[15:15] <avar> you might argue not great, but certanly not unusable.

[15:15] <Arathorn> and *terrible* performance for searching

[15:15] <avar> Arathorn: What do you suggest instead?

[15:15] <Arathorn> which is hilarious, given how it's run by google :|

[15:16] * Arathorn built an alternative setup during the deja/GG hiatus called siliconarchive.net

[15:16] <Arathorn> which is very down atm, and never made it out of beta

[15:18] <macintsh> I said, "Oh, I thought this was perl"

[15:18] <macintsh> his answer: "i thought sed just called perl"

[15:19] <Arathorn> heh

[15:19] <audreyt> maybe his system maps sed to psed

[15:19] <audreyt> in which case that'd be true

[15:26] <cognominal> does use of  $!foo short-circuit accessors?

[15:26] <audreyt> JLI is a macro that has & before bar

[15:26] <audreyt> cognominal: yes, that's the idea, though not the implementation

[15:26] <audreyt> Arathorn: if you s/bar/foo/g all works

[15:26] <cognominal> audreyt: thx

[15:26] <Arathorn> right

[15:26] * Arathorn assumed that Pvoid_t's were, well, pointers to void types

[15:26] <Arathorn> and could be assigned around as such

[15:27] <Arathorn> thanks for checking it

[15:27] <audreyt> np :)

[15:28] <audreyt>     JLI(PValue, foo, 'a');

[15:28] <audreyt>     *PValue = 123;

[15:28] <audreyt> and finally

[15:28] <audreyt>     fprintf(stderr, "Got PValue for 'a' as %i\n", *PValue);

[15:28] <audreyt> is the usual usage

[15:29] <cognominal> can we have both %.foo and @%.foo on a given class?

[15:29] <cognominal> oops

[15:29] <cognominal> I meant: can we have both %.foo and @.foo on a given class?

[15:30] <audreyt> no.

[15:30] <cognominal> that would preclude calling %.foo with array context?

[15:30] <audreyt> actually

[15:30] <audreyt> has %.foo;

[15:30] <audreyt> is just

[15:30] <audreyt> has $.foo is Hash;

[15:30] <audreyt> i.e. it concerns the storage

[15:31] <audreyt> the public-facing interface remains constant

[15:31] <audreyt> if you have declared

[15:31] <audreyt> has $.foo;

[15:31] <audreyt> you can use %.foo freely in your method body

[15:31] <audreyt> and vise versa

[15:32] <cognominal> so that is for module name space, not instance name space that sigils are part of the name.

[15:32] <audreyt> $.foo is really just short for self.foo :)

[15:32] <audreyt> (it used to be ./foo)

[15:33] <cognominal> reading meijer, I think that would be nice to support something like  my @?a (array with 0 or 0 element), @+a (array with more than one element) and so on

[15:34] <audreyt> my @a is (Array where .elems < 1)

[15:34] <audreyt> my @a is (Array where .elems < 2)

[15:34] <cognominal> that would slightly complexify the current type system but would give support for sp,e feaire of xml schemas

[15:35] <audreyt> I think constraint types can already do that

[15:35] <cognominal> ho, so we alrady got that semantically

[15:35] <audreyt> albeit checked at runtime

[15:35] <audreyt> not compile time

[15:35] <audreyt> for compile time checking, a great deal more thought is needed

[15:35] <cognominal> Meijer system does not seem complecated as type system go.

[15:36] <audreyt> it's not. it's at least not dependent typing.

[15:36] <cognominal> It seems to be a slight complexification of perl that know only about scalar, hash and arrays

[15:37] <Limbic_Region> and globs and formats

[15:37] <cognominal> no I don't thinks it really as complex as dependant typing

[15:37] <audreyt> I do wish to work out more 6.2831 (typesystem) details

[15:37] <audreyt> with Erik during the Redmond hackathon

[15:37] <audreyt> but for now my brain is still on 6.28 :)

[15:37] <cognominal> you mean Eriki meijer?

[15:37] <audreyt> yeah

[15:37] <cognominal> cool

[15:37] <audreyt> going to visit him June 19~24

[15:37] <audreyt> the week before YAPC::NA

[15:38] <audreyt> and give a talk there

[15:38] <audreyt> maybe also visit more lambdafolks nearby, e.g. @ galois.com

[15:38] <cognominal> he seems both knowledgeable and practical about type systems.

[15:38] <cognominal> and Perl is all about practicalyity

[15:39] <audreyt> Erik's design has many things in common with perl6 design :)

[15:39] <rafl> Juerd: Could you please send my PBP to me?

[15:39] <cognominal> I noticed...

[15:40] * eric256 wishes he could manage all the travling audreyt does. ;)  ...or even half

[15:41] <audreyt> actually, June 15~16 I'll be @ Oslo

[15:41] <audreyt> so it's like, three time zones

[15:41] <audreyt> in 72 hours

[15:41] <audreyt> tw -> eu -> tw -> us

[15:42] <audreyt> never tried that before; may or may not work :)

[15:42] <TimToady> audreyt: foo {...} 1,2,3 is wrong, needs a comma.

[15:42] <audreyt> then S04 needs updating. I'll do that.

[15:42] <TimToady> k

[15:42] <audreyt> er I mean S03.

[15:42] <TimToady> k2

[15:43] <audreyt> so what about

[15:43] <audreyt> foo {...}   ,1,2,3

[15:43] <audreyt> that's fine right?

[15:43] <TimToady> I'd be okay with not making it fine, but if you're okay with making it fine, that also works...

[15:44] <audreyt> I think making it fine is slightly less surprising :)

[15:45] <audreyt> foo({...}.moose)

[15:45] <audreyt> is still fine, right?

[15:45] <audreyt> it's just

[15:45] <audreyt> foo {...}.moose

[15:45] <audreyt> is parsed differently

[15:45] <particle_> will 'my $foo=  $bar;' do what it does in perl5, or am i stuck with using ' = ' for assignment in p6?

[15:45] <TimToady> { } terminates list if next thing is . yes

[15:46] <audreyt> particle_: until someone defines postfix =, you should be fine

[15:46] <wolverian> output as lines? :)

[15:46] *** jsiracusa joined
[15:46] <avar> Can one add stuff like "s[]{}g" to perl 6? I.e. define a function that looks like that sort of op?

[15:47] <audreyt> sure, it's called a macro

[15:47] <avar> (replacement, or y///)

[15:47] *** wilx`` joined
[15:47] <avar> is the macro aware of what sort of quote delimiters you used?

[15:47] <TimToady> the macro gets control of the parse right after the macro name.

[15:48] <particle_> audrey, does my example extend to all assignment ops?

[15:48] <audreyt> particle_: it extends to all infix-that-may-clash-with-postfix.

[15:48] <audreyt> including but not limited to assignment

[15:48] <TimToady> S02 discusses this.

[15:48] <avar> TimToady: And I presume quote delimiters are not parts of the name?;)

[15:48] <particle_> ah, i'll have a look there.

[15:49] <TimToady> not unless you've defined the name to include them.

[15:49] <TimToady> macro regognition is not predicated on ident recognition.

[15:49] <TimToady> it's just "longest token".

[15:49] <svnbot6> r10187 | audreyt++ |     map { $_ + 1 }, 1, 2, 3, 4;

[15:49] <svnbot6> r10187 | audreyt++ |   expect major smoke breakage.

[15:50] * eric256 just got used to leaving the quote off in p5 ;)

[15:52] <audreyt> hm. is rx:P5:{} legal?

[15:52] <TimToady> basically map {...} 1,2,3 was the last vestige of P5 indirect object syntax.

[15:52] <audreyt> the "rx:P5 {}" form is a bit visually nondistinct.

[15:53] <TimToady> I think using space consistently to indicate "this is not an adverb arg" is better than space-or-colon.

[15:53] <audreyt> okie.

[15:53] <TimToady> frees up :{} to mean something else too

[15:54] * audreyt yields to TimToady's judgement

[15:55] * eric256 supppose most the time in p6 you are going to say @a.map {  } or @a ==> map { } any way   or even map { } <<== @a  ....unless i missed the demise of the pipes ;)

[15:56] <audreyt> the pipes is alive and well and I even understand what they are doing now :)

[15:56] * wolverian ponders about >>= 

[15:56] *** gilimanjaro joined
[15:56] * audreyt ponders about using that to redefine macro infix<;>.

[15:56] <TimToady> dakkar: in q:to/foo/ the /foo/ is *not* an argument to :to

[15:56] <audreyt> infix:<;>, even.

[15:57] <eric256> are pipes implemented in pugs yet?

[15:57] <audreyt> no. I'll have to implement Capture first

[15:58] <eric256> will pipes only work with functions that expect a list/array as their last arg?

[15:58] <audreyt> not so; it can work with anything :)

[15:59] <audreyt> say(int <== 1);

[15:59] <eric256> so it just starts filling in the functions arguments starting where the user left off?

[16:00] <audreyt> normally, yes.

[16:00] <audreyt> the function can choose to distinguish between "pipe batches" using @@foo

[16:00] <audreyt> in their signature

[16:00] <eric256> ahhh. cool.

[16:00] <audreyt> but otherwise, yes, it's asif the function args just gets extended

[16:01] * eric256 thinks p6 is giong to have so many new features its going to take years to figure it all out ;)

[16:01] <TimToady> "pipe batches"++

[16:01] <audreyt> that's okay, same for p5

[16:01] <eric256> not a problem at all...just exciting ;)

[16:01] <audreyt> TimToady: better than "parallel arguments"? :)

[16:01] <Juerd> rafl: email me your address again please

[16:02] <rafl> Juerd: Aye

[16:02] <TimToady> I think of them as "multidimensional slices", but pipe batches is a user-friendlier term.

[16:02] <cognominal> $object = $class.bless: {k1 => $v1, k2 => $v2 }; # is this correct?

[16:02] <rafl> Juerd: Done

[16:03] <TimToady> and indicates the laziness of them better.

[16:03] <audreyt> cognominal: looks fine

[16:03] <cognominal> that would be a third way to initialize

[16:04] *** weinig|sleep is now known as weinig

[16:04] <Arathorn> gah - if foo = bar doesn't work in judyland, how on earth /do/ you assign a JudyL around?  does anyone know anywhere else more appropriate where i can ask judy q's?

[16:05] <audreyt> Arathorn: you assign JudyL around by assigning &foo around

[16:05] <TimToady> cognominal: as long as you realize that $class probably isn't one...

[16:05] <audreyt> I think

[16:06] <cognominal> TimToady: I may be dense, but I don't get what you mean

[16:06] <TimToady> $class is just a class indicator--something that can be used to find the real class.

[16:06] <audreyt> cognominal: Dog.bless(...) works

[16:06] <audreyt> but also does

[16:06] <audreyt> $fido.bless(...)

[16:06] <cognominal> ok

[16:06] <TimToady> Dog is not a class, but an undefined prototype object.

[16:06] * Arathorn puts &foo in a PPvoid_t, then, and tries that...

[16:06] <TimToady> but it still has .meta

[16:06] <rw-rw-r--> <bad-joke>why, did fido sneeze?</bad-joke>

[16:07] <audreyt> (where "undefined prototype object" means simply that it has .defined set to false, and throws exception on attribute slot access)

[16:07] <TimToady> at least for Dog attributes...

[16:07] <audreyt> right.

[16:08] <TimToady> .defined(Mammal) might be true at the same time.

[16:08] <audreyt> you mean .Mammal::defined?

[16:09] <audreyt> or defined(x, y) is another form now?

[16:09] <audreyt> (x: y), even

[16:09] <TimToady> I was thinking of the latter, actually.

[16:09] <audreyt> 'k.

[16:09] <TimToady> more like an isa.

[16:09] <audreyt> gotcha.

[16:09] <cognominal> no one followed up my p6l post about interroperability with js. I thought it raised interesting questions beyond  inteterroperability  was it unreadable or what?

[16:12] <audreyt> cognominal: parrot distinguishes between Null and Undef

[16:12] <Arathorn> cognominal: i suspect it got lost in the ensuing "A shorter long dot" epic

[16:12] <audreyt> where Null means your "uninitialized"

[16:12] <szbalint> There is no direct way to use C libraries with Pugs atm, apart from that Haskell workaround mentioned in the docs, right?

[16:13] <audreyt> szbalint: right, sadly. can you submit it as a Summer of Code ticket?

[16:13] <eric256> and undefined means initialized but no value? doesn't that sound backwards?  /me isn't advocating change, just amused

[16:13] <TimToady> P6 distinguishes undef that is "interesting" from undef that is "uninteresting".  I'd say uninitialized is uninteresting.

[16:13] <audreyt> szbalint: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/newticket

[16:14] <cognominal> and how does it translate at the Perl6 level?

[16:14] <TimToady> if an undef contains an exception, it's not merely "uninitialized"

[16:14] <audreyt> szbalint: use the subject "Pugs - Foreign Function Interface"

[16:14] <audreyt> the "interesting" part is called "Failure" atm

[16:15] <audreyt>     Undef       Undefined (can serve as a prototype object of any class)

[16:15] <audreyt>     Failure     Failure (throws an exception if not handled properly)

[16:15] <audreyt> cognominal: see S04 for "Failure"

[16:15] <cognominal> ok

[16:15] <TimToady> so basically we already make the distinction

[16:16] <szbalint> audreyt: ok, give me a sec

[16:16] <TimToady> but people can think of the two kinds of undef as one until they need to make the distinction

[16:16] <audreyt> actually, Whatever belongs there too

[16:16] <audreyt> as it also has a false .defined

[16:16] <TimToady> that's because it's just a prototype

[16:17] <TimToady> the extra "value" of Whatever is that you can't instantiate it.

[16:17] <cognominal> I suppose this will be usefultoo  for  Perl6 macros for support of SQL within Perl6

[16:18] * audreyt adds Whatever to S06.

[16:18] <TimToady> don't let dduncan hear you mentioning SQL in the same breath as P6... :)

[16:18] <cognominal> I meant a cleaner SQL :)

[16:19] <TimToady> I believe dduncan thinks the cleanest SQL is a dead SQL.

[16:19] <nnunley> cognominal: Something like LINQ?

[16:20] <cognominal> yea, all this Meijer stuff sounds vey good.

[16:21] <audreyt> sometimes, not having a huge IDE to maintain can be an advantage :)

[16:21] <nnunley> So, basicly stronger set/iterator manipulation as syntactic sugar.

[16:21] <audreyt> (Erik ranted on LtU that a lot of effort went into ensuring that Visual Studio can still work)

[16:23] <cognominal> I expect that some day the reference representation of a program will be its syntax tree,  programmer will just happen to work on a convenient deparsing view.

[16:23] <cognominal> But that means a redesign of the whole ecosystem.

[16:23] <cognominal> s/syntax tree/AST/

[16:24] <cognominal> so Larry will be free to invent new syntax without fear of breaking backard compatibility

[16:24] <audreyt> that is already the case with macro-enabled languages

[16:25] <audreyt> Perl6 is not unique; CodeDOM, TH, Scheme, etc all do that

[16:25] <TimToady> It could almost be said that P6 was designed with that as the primary goal

[16:25] <audreyt> though Perl6 is somewhat unique in doing a scannerless macro system

[16:26] <cognominal> renaming a variable would be a simple operation.

[16:26] <audreyt> with unlimited prec levels

[16:26] <cognominal> that my litmus test.

[16:27] <audreyt> everywhere (mkT renameVar) p6ast

[16:27] <audreyt>     where

[16:27] <audreyt>     renameVar (Var "$x") = Var "$y"

[16:27] <audreyt>     renameVar others = others

[16:27] <audreyt> (that's how currently it works in Pugs internals)

[16:27] <audreyt> need to expose that to p6 level.

[16:28] <TimToady> does that hide the old name?

[16:28] <cognominal> nice to see that my brain is already partly in resonance with yours :)

[16:28] <audreyt> TimToady: "hide"?

[16:28] <audreyt> it replaces all leaves in the tree

[16:28] * eric256 toggles a few switches on the resonance generator and laughs evily

[16:29] <TimToady> so it has a different name at a different level, not a duplicate name.  That's all I was asking.

[16:30] <TimToady> not the same as aliasing then

[16:30] <audreyt> no, not the same

[16:30] <TimToady> fine

[16:30] <audreyt> it's as if you did a semantic-sensitive s:g///

[16:31] <TimToady> so I wonder if term:<$foo> works everywhere it ought to.

[16:31] <xinming> my $s = "Test"; require "$s";    <-- will this be valid?

[16:31] <TimToady> that is, macro term:<$foo>

[16:31] <audreyt> xinming: yes. see S11

[16:31] <audreyt> require "/home/non/Sense.pm" <common @horse>;

[16:33] <TimToady> it's more like a macro ast:<$foo>

[16:33] <TimToady> term implies syntactic matching, not semantic, I think

[16:34] <audreyt> I think it's probably a generic programming operation on the AST object.

[16:34] <TimToady> it's one of those "is deeply" things...

[16:34] <TimToady> but how do you declare it in P6?

[16:34] <audreyt> we don't have a "generic deep-map" operation equivalent of the "everywhere" above

[16:34] <audreyt> it can be simulated easily with a visitor pattern

[16:35] <wolverian> isn't that everywhere just fmap? I don't quite understand the generics library..

[16:35] <audreyt> wolverian: no... fmap goes on level

[16:35] <TimToady> I guess at worst it's just a .wrap on something somewhere...

[16:35] <audreyt> one level

[16:36] <wolverian> audreyt, oh? I thought you're supposed to define, e.g. fmap xs = map fmap xs for lists.

[16:36] <TimToady> except a .wrap is not likely to be reversible...

[16:36] <audreyt> multi replaceVar (Var :(:name<$foo>)) { Var.new(name => '$bar') }

[16:36] <audreyt> multi replaceVar ($x) { $x }

[16:37] <audreyt> wolverian: it works on any data type

[16:37] <audreyt> wolverian: your fmap can only work for [[[[a]]]]

[16:37] <audreyt> or similar

[16:37] <audreyt> wolverian: but "everywhere" works even on [([a],b)]

[16:37] <audreyt> wolverian: it skips the leaves where type doesn't match the replacement function

[16:37] <wolverian> and fmap works only on Functors?

[16:38] <wolverian> hrm, right. case :)

[16:38] <audreyt> :)

[16:39] <audreyt> $p6ast.everywhere(&replaceVar)

[16:39] <audreyt> now, the definition of .everywhere is very handwavy at this moment :)

[16:39] <TimToady> .whatever (ducks)

[16:39] <audreyt> *.*(*)

[16:40] <TimToady> that'd do it...

[16:40] <wolverian> $program.whenever({ $x == 3 } => { say "debug" })

[16:40] * audreyt ponders "pugs -e '*'"

[16:40] <audreyt> maybe it dies with "Oh yeah, whatever, never mind"

[16:40] <wolverian> I guess that would print debugs on every clock tick when $x == 3

[16:41] <wolverian> which might be a bit flood-ish

[16:41] <audreyt> maybe it flipflops

[16:41] <TimToady> last message repeated 2784937289734893 times...

[16:42] <eric256> by flipflops you mean its only fired when $x becomes 3 ?

[16:59] <ingy> actually the query language is one thing we haven't sttled yet

[16:59] <obra> an object backend for jifty would be very hot

[16:59] <audreyt> clearly you should use J or APL as the query language

[16:59] <ingy> obra: yes it would

[17:00] <ingy> audreyt: ok

[17:00] <ingy> oren of yaml is helping out too

[17:00] <audreyt> for example, the "avg" function can be defined in J as

[17:26] <eric256> push @spelfiles, map { "$d/$_" }, grep { $_ ~~ /.spel$/ }, readdir $d;

[17:26] <eric256> those look like  they are al arguments to push now. ;) /me watches audreyt try to figure out how to ask me to NOT help ;)

[17:27] <audreyt> grep needs it too

[17:27] <audreyt> listop is naturally right assoc

[17:27] <audreyt> so that's just fine

[17:28] <audreyt> otoh, you can write it like

[17:28] <TimToady> yes, we can retire undef assignment.

[17:28] <audreyt> @spelfiles.push(readdir($d).grep:{/.spel$/}.map{"$d/$_"});

[17:46] <flounder99> if it were = not := @a would slurp up everthing and @b would be an empty array

[17:47] <TimToady> right

[17:47] <flounder99> I guess slurping and binding don't go together.  That makes sense

[17:48] <TimToady> slurping must be explicit under binding.

[19:56] <svnbot6> r10202 | eric256++ |  added comma for map to t/statments/*

[19:56] <eric256> ahh now look what i did....didn't use my svkpush alias.  /me goes to get more caffine

[19:59] * eric256 checks lwalls commit and sees that lwall works much much faster at that. ;)

[19:59] <eric256> i got like 5 files and you got the other 100 ;)

[20:00] <TimToady> probably missed some sorts though..

[20:01] <TimToady> the hard part was *not* fixing the P5 files... :)

[20:01] <eric256> yea i had to undo that a couple of times.

[20:01] *** mschmidt joined
[20:03] <eric256> i need to write a program to search thinkgeek and get me the most cool stuff for $100 ;)

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> the difficulty in that eric256 is the definition of "cool"

[20:06] *** mschmidt left
[20:06] <TimToady> eric256: you took out the parens I put around the maps in t/statements/map-and-sort-in-for.t

[20:07] <TimToady> those shouldn't parse without parens these days

[20:07] <TimToady> or teh {...} is taken as the for's block

[20:09] *** larsen joined
[20:10] <eric256> i took parens out?  i didn't think so

[20:10] <TimToady> well, didn't put parens in, then overrode my change...

[20:11] <eric256> i didn't think my version had parns... i certianly didn't mean to remove them if i di.

[20:11] <TimToady> don't sweat it--I'll fix...

[20:11] * eric256 has spent most the day fighting with svk instead of working with it lol

[20:14] <svnbot6> r10203 | lwall++ | bare {...} in a for list needs parens now

[20:15] <TimToady> hmm, looks like ext/HTML-Entities/t/entities.t is looping...

[20:35] *** cognominal joined
[20:50] <TimToady> ext/URI/t/escape.t also loops

[20:53] <TimToady> eric256: that'd have to be @a.sort.map:{1}.for({print $_}) or something equivalent.

[20:53] <TimToady> methods don't take arguments unless followed by : or (

[20:54] <eric256> so that should probably be      for @a.sort.map:{1} { ... }    anyway

[20:54] <eric256> or would that still need to be in ( )?

[20:55] <TimToady> depends on wehter there's really a :{} adverb.

[20:55] <TimToady> if there is, it doesn't need parens.

[20:56] <TimToady> but if that's really .map: {1}, where the colon is just introducing an unparenthesized list, then it would need parens.

[20:56] *** aufrank joined
[20:57] <TimToady> at the moment I'm leaning towards saying that :{} exists as an adverbial form, so it doesn't imply any following args.

[20:57] <TimToady> and you wouldn't need parens

[20:57] <eric256> makes sense

[20:58] <TimToady> that is, it parses as .map :{1} so you have an adverb modifying an argumntless .map

[20:58] <particle_> is that the goatee op?

[20:59] <eric256> i thought it was a cookie monster

[20:59] <TimToady> the .map:{1} form parses the :{ as a token

[20:59] <particle_> :-{0}

[21:00] <TimToady> otherwise it would have to parse as .map : {1} which would be the argument form of .map

[21:00] * eric256 needs to go read about adverbs

[21:01] <spinclad> 8^{[=]}

[21:02] <TimToady> t/builtins/sprintf_and_as.t also loopos

[21:04] <spinclad> adverbs must stay completely covered when out in the sun

[21:15] <TimToady> kewel, dewed!

[21:19] <spinclad> lol (really!)  so that's three meanings!

[21:20] * eric256 wishes there was a lottery or something to when to go to the YAPC::NA 

[21:24] <buu> Mmm, parrot.

[21:29] <TimToady> would appear that t/syntax/list_quote_whitespace.t is the 5th loopo

[21:30] <eric256> loopo?

[21:30] <eric256> infinite loop?

[21:46] <TimToady> it seems that sprintf is hanging

[21:48] <particle_> buu: that's a known parrot test failure

[21:48] <TimToady> yes, this hangs: say sprintf '%d', 123;

[22:00] <svnbot6> r10204 | lwall++ | any<a b c> is not the same as any <a b c>

[22:01] <eric256> are we getting just a little crazy now?  /me fears perl6 will be way too much like python with all these space issues.

[22:10] * avar wouldn't care if it was like python in that regard

[22:10] <TimToady> the postfix vs non-postfix difference is crucial.

[22:11] <Juerd> eric256: I think we are, but I don't see any good solution to the problem.

[22:12] <Juerd> eric256: Not requiring parens is a problem if every other character is both an infix and a prefix operator :)

[22:12] <Juerd> And sometimes postfix too.

[22:12] <eric256> in these cases make the postfix and non-postfix forms act the same?  of course then it might just increase the confusion

[22:12] <Juerd> eric256: How would you do that?

[22:12] <eric256> what would any<a b c> be?

[22:13] <TimToady> any.{'a','b','c'}

[22:14] <eric256> and any <a b c> is any("a","b","c") ....i don't know what any.{ ... } would mean though. must be time to reread the S's again

[22:14] <svnbot6> r10205 | lwall++ | any<a b c> is not the same as any <a b c>, continued

[22:14] <TimToady> Doesn't mean anything, which is why you don't do that...

[22:15] <eric256> so why not make .{ a postfix op on any that does what we expect?  i dunno, guess i'm just stuck in the but it doesn't DWIM phase.

[22:15] *** jsiracusa joined
[22:16] <TimToady> It should blow up and say that you can't treat a Junction like a Hash.

[22:17] <eric256> oh yea...forgot < > was hash access also.  i feel soo lost some days

[22:18] <eric256> if it were to DWIM  i would assume that < > just replaced ( ) when used in a function arg context and auto split/quoted liked < > does

[22:18] <eric256> then  any<a b c> ~~ any <a b c> ~~ any('a', 'b', 'c') ~~ any(<a b c>)

[22:19] <eric256> but i wouldn't presume to have any idea what side effects that would cause

[23:08] <TimToady> buu: those failed when I ran parrot this morning, so I suppose they're "known"...

[23:08] <buu> TimToady: Heh, ok.

[23:10] <buu> Hrm. Where does parrot look for .so files, LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
