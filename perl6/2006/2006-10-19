[03:03] <TreyHarris> what's the Perl 5 equivalent of / (\d+) { $0 < 256 or fail } / ?  is there one?

[03:04] <audreyt> yes it involves (??{...})

[03:05] <audreyt> qr/(\d+) (??{$1 < 256 ? '(?!)' : ''})/x

[03:05] <audreyt> or some such.

[03:18] <agentzh> Khisanth: nodnod

[03:18] <agentzh> :)

[03:18] <Khisanth> although it definitely does NOT work when you only have 256MB of memory

[03:19] <agentzh> indeed

[03:19] <agentzh> i'll upload the diagram generator to cpan (possibly with the name UML::Class) once it's mature enough.

[03:20] <SamB> Khisanth: oh well! I never even build pugs anymore anyway.

[03:20] <TreyHarris> I think the actual equivalent in perl 5 is qr/((?<!\d)\d+(?!\d)) (??{$1 < 256 ? '' : '(?!)'})/x

[03:21] <TreyHarris> Perl 6 regexes are soo much nicer :)

[03:21] <SamB> that does look pretty damn nice, as regexes go!

[03:22] <TreyHarris> SamB: "/ (\d+) { $0 < 256 or fail } /" looks nice?  or you were sarcastically saying that that perl 5 monstrosity looks nice?  or you really think it does look nice? :)

[03:22] <SamB> the perl6 version!

[03:23] <TreyHarris> ah.  k, yes :)

[03:23] <SamB> what kind of fool do you take me for?

[03:23] <TreyHarris> though.... hmmmm.... maybe that's not the equivalent perl 5.  do any of the current engines compile the above RE?

[03:24] <SamB> Even a (former?) Python user can recognize a nice looking regular expression when he sees one...

[03:24] <TreyHarris> Was thinking about the "2360" case, which I don't know would match 236 or not.

[03:24] <Khisanth> TreyHarris: strange RE you got there

[03:24] <TreyHarris> Khisanth: it's from S05.

[03:25] <Khisanth> I mean the perl 5 version

[03:25] <TreyHarris> oh, how so, is there a better way?

[03:25] <TreyHarris> i'm feverish with flu, so i'm willing to bet i missed something obvious

[03:25] <Khisanth> I mean the \d+ is already greedy, the look arounds appear to be completely unnecessary

[03:26] <eviltwin_b> I was wondering about that myself

[03:26] <TreyHarris> Khisanth: oh?  try it, leave them out, it matches 236 when you have 2360

[03:27] <Khisanth> hmm

[03:27] <Khisanth> I guess the (??{}) is forcing it to backtrack :)

[03:27] <TreyHarris> yes, of course :)

[03:27] <eviltwin_b> oh, I see, /x is on by default in perl6 I take it

[03:28] <Khisanth> yes

[03:28] <TreyHarris> being able to finely control backtracking is a Perl 6 neologism

[03:28] <eviltwin_b> and yes, it would backtrack and try again; that's the nature of regex matching

[03:28] <TreyHarris> eviltwin_b: you need to read S05... backtracking is no longer "the nature" of matching; as i just mentioned, you can control it pretty finely in Perl 6

[03:29] <eviltwin_b> well, it's certainly the nature of perl5 (and other regexp engines) backtracking, which was the actual subject there

[03:29] <TreyHarris> *nod* yes

[03:30] <TreyHarris> you're right of course.

[03:32] <TreyHarris> must catch my bus, i will see scrollback when i get home &

[03:33] <eviltwin_b> I admit to being well behind the curve on p6 stuff,  need to do a lot of reading up :>

[03:33] <TreyHarris> eviltwin_b: smartlinks make it MUCH faster to get up to speed

[03:34] <eviltwin_b> (for those wondering wtf the crazy is:  see getcwd.pl in perl5 :)

[03:34] <TreyHarris> i'd actually recommend you read the specs that way: go to smoke.pugscode.org, find some recent smoketest with a SYN link, and use that to read the synopses.  then you'll know as you're reading what's implemented yet and what's not

[03:34] <TreyHarris> & really now

[03:34] <eviltwin_b> I think that's the only contribution I made that had any staying power (and was about the last thing I expected to stick around...)

[09:09] <nothingmuch_> @tell cmarcelo in the first revision of MO all the is rw were is ro. I think we should have an is ro version, where it's just records, and a tvar/IORef version that is modifyiable by the runtime. when moh steps into action the IORef-y version is simplified into the read only version, so that the other code can stay purely functional

[15:05] <fglock> @tell stevan  you have studied Scheme, right? - does it make sense to have a Scheme backend?

[15:05] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[15:11] <TimToady> cool.

[18:02] <TimToady> [:bytes .] but will fail if string doesn't present a bytes interface.

[18:03] <demq> so will it allow access to the byte representation of the internal string?

[18:04] <demq> because \C can be used to make perl get very unhappy.

[18:04] <demq> since it can absorb a byte of a multibyte sequences making any further processing of the string dubious.

[18:06] <demq> i wonder why it was added actually.

[18:07] <eviltwin_b> struck me as a quick hack to enable byte processing instead of unicode.  not well thought out

[18:07] <eviltwin_b> then again, that's perl <6 for you :>

[18:08] <demq> yeah, it looks to me like a "we can do this, so why not?" without bothering to do any research on the why not.

[18:08] <demq> im talking about \C not whatever perl6 will do.

[18:10] <demq> it looks like nobody has used \C either. at least judging by the google code search

[18:25] <demq> perl6 will have the same dump keyword?

[18:25] <Juerd> Possibly.

[18:25] * [particle] waves to TreyHarris

[18:26] <PerlJam> I hope perl6's dump means something different from perl5's though  :)

[18:27] <Juerd> demq: Normal strings will probably not have a bytes interface. Buffers will, and they won't have codepoint interfaces.

[18:27] <demq> thats too bad. its a wasted keyword mostly.

[18:27] <Juerd> demq: It's possible to have a string that presents both interfaces, but this requires extra care, either by the type's implementation, or the user.

[18:27] <Juerd> I personally think it makes no sense to have a string present itself both as bytes and as characters.

[18:28] <TreyHarris> PerlJam: there will, I assume, be *some* way to call dump(), even if it isn't called that.

[18:28] * TreyHarris waves to [particle] 

[18:28] <Juerd> PerlJam: Why? What's wrong with dump?

[18:29] <Juerd> (The function, not its name)

[18:30] <PerlJam> Juerd: nothing is wrong with the functionality, just the name really

[18:30] <eviltwin_b> mmm, namespace wastage

[18:31] <Juerd> PerlJam: I agree. It should be somewhere in Internals::

[18:31] <Juerd> (In perl 5)

[18:31] <TreyHarris> or POSIX maybe?  does win32 support core dumps?

[18:31] *** weinig|bbl is now known as weinig

[18:32] <TreyHarris> POSIX.dump() would be fine

[18:37] <TimToady> Juerd: strings with multiple abstraction levels make sense only if string positions and lengths are not numbers but opaque abstractions.

[18:40] <TimToady> and to the extent you treat them as numbers, they must be numbers that know which unit of abstraction is intended.

[18:42] <wolverian> what do you say to a person who calls state an improper abstraction?

[18:44] <demq> depends who they are

[18:45] <wolverian> the opponent :)

[18:45] <TimToady> you say, "But, but, all abstractions are improper to an aristotellian..."

[18:45] <demq> i think you ask them to clearly define proper abstraction, and then wander off before they can finish.

[18:47] <wolverian> my knowledge of the classics is lacking.

[21:37] <audreyt> what seano did was setting up so all $?FOO become global...

[21:38] <TimToady> seems like compile-time's $*STRICT should get mapped to lexically scoped $?STRICT.

[21:38] <audreyt> yes.

[21:39] <audreyt> or rather, push to the envPragmas structure

[21:39] <audreyt> not sure we need to expose all pragmas via $?FOO

[22:11] <Limbic_Region> as in "I run to work every morning"

[22:11] <Juerd> Sorry....

[22:11] <Juerd> I know that English is weird in many ways. But this I am finding hard to believe.

[22:11] <TimToady> that's okay, you can find it hard to believe in general.  :)

[22:12] <Juerd> I don't find it hard to believe in general. Or, well, I'm not sure yet, as I'm already finding it a bit easier to believe :)

[22:12] <TimToady> I'm sure there are also exceptions...

[22:13] <Juerd> How on earth can a language get this weird?

[22:13] <Juerd> Where you can't use present tense for present tense, or simple past for past tense...

[22:14] <TimToady> The English look at the Americans, and the Americans look back at the English...

[22:14] <nezcaz> latin :p

[22:14] <Juerd> Latin made more sense in this respect.

[22:14] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - have you read (m)?any of Steven Pinker's books?

[22:14] <TimToady> nope.  I think my wife has though.

[22:15] <TimToady> but then she reads pretty much everything.

[22:15] * Juerd should perhaps unsubscribe from a few mailinglists

[22:15] <Juerd> And just read the weekly summaries

[22:16] <Juerd> TimToady: Then she must really love the Gutenberg project :)

[22:16] * Limbic_Region hasn't read much non-fiction lately which isn't the norm

[22:16] * Juerd doesn't read much at all.

[22:16] <Juerd> I'm too impatient

[22:16] <TimToady> I think she probably read most of the Gutenberg project while it was still on paper.

[22:16] <Juerd> TimToady: Heh

[22:17] <Limbic_Region> wow

[22:17] <Juerd> Of technical books I often only get halfway through

[22:17] <Juerd> s/Of t/T/

[22:17] <Juerd> And I don't even begin reading fiction

[22:18] * Juerd loves Perl Hacks

[22:18] <Juerd> I can read it in random order and it still makes sense

[22:22] <nezcaz> use Math::TrulyRandom to be sure that u are random enough :p

[22:32] <TimToady> most of my failures appear to be a bare block at statement level being taken as a hash because the code inside was all commented out.  I don't think statement block should turn into hash ever.

[22:33] <TimToady> @tell audreyt most of my smoke failures appear to be a bare block at statement level being taken as a hash because the code inside was all commented out.  I don't think statement block should turn into hash ever.

[22:33] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[22:56] <TimToady> also possible that .perl shouldn't put out something that in isolation would be misinterpreted at a statement boundary...
