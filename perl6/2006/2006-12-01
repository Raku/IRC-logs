[16:06] <cmeyer> Hi

[16:06] <cmeyer> I'm trying to build parrot and am running into trouble.

[16:07] <cmeyer> ./parrot -o runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pbc runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pir

[16:07] <cmeyer> error:imcc:syntax error, unexpected $undefined

[16:07] <cmeyer>         in file 'runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pir' line 18

[16:07] *** fglock joined
[16:09] <kolibrie> ooooh, fglock!

[16:09] * kolibrie just compiled two modules using MiniPerl6

[16:09] <kolibrie> (now to find out if they work)

[16:10] *** justatheory joined
[16:11] <fglock> kolibrie: please let me know :)

[16:11] <kolibrie> fglock: will do

[16:11] <szabgab> cmeyer: I just built parrot withou problem, maybe you need to make clean before?

[16:11] <kolibrie> I'm sure I'll have questions

[16:11] *** avar joined
[16:12] <cmeyer> szabgab: I did do a make realclean.

[16:12] <fglock> kolibrie: mp6-parrot can already run simple things

[16:12] <kolibrie> fglock: I'm returning to my extraction project from a month or two ago

[16:13] <kolibrie> so mostly grammars

[16:14] <fglock> kolibrie: please note that mp6 grammars are "very" limited

[16:14] <fglock> see it's own grammars for examples

[16:15] <kolibrie> fglock: more limited than Pugs::Compiler::Rule?

[16:15] <fglock> yes - the grammar was much simplified in order to bootstrap easily

[16:17] * DebolazX prods stevan

[16:17] <stevan> Debolaz: I answered you over on irc.perl.org,.. I lost my stupid freenode password, and I am too lazy to get a new one :)

[16:18] <kolibrie> fglock: hopefully it will have everything I need, or I can fall back to PCR (I hope)

[16:18] <kolibrie> stevan: now is the time!  do it now!

[16:18] <stevan> kolibrie: naaah,... still too lazy :P

[16:19] <kolibrie> stevan: okay, well, maybe next year

[16:19] <stevan> kolibrie: :)

[16:21] <cmeyer> I just checked out a fresh parrot (r#15918), and am still failing at the same point, runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pir. 

[16:23] <DebolazX> stevan: Problem is, that client is at home. I'm far away from home, I'm all the way over at the office. :-)

[16:23] * DebolazX boots up another client.

[16:24] <TimToady> cmeyer: have you ever installed parrot?

[16:25] <TimToady> you might have something old sitting around interfering

[16:25] <TimToady> not even a make realclean would get rid of that.

[16:25] <TimToady> you'd have to hunt it down and remove it by hand.

[16:25] <cmeyer> TimToady: yeah, I've got a /usr/local/bin/parrot. But the build is calling ./parrot .

[16:25] <cmeyer> I'll try killing the installed parrot.

[16:26] <TimToady> usually it's the installed libs that get you.

[16:27] <TimToady> so people working on bleeding edge pugs and parrot tend not to install, but just make a symlink from /usr/local/bin/foo to the actual binary

[16:27] <svnbot6> r14858 | fglock++ | MP6-Parrot - fixed lookup-binding

[16:28] <cmeyer> I'll try rm -rf /usr/local/lib/parrot and rebuild. Thx for the advice.

[16:28] <TimToady> you did do a realclean first?

[16:28] <cmeyer> Yep.

[16:28] <TimToady> the rm is likely to fix it then.

[16:29] <TimToady> unless it's something architectural

[16:29] <cmeyer> I'll know shortly. :)

[16:29] <TimToady> or someone broke the build...

[16:29] *** weinig|bbl is now known as weinig

[16:29] <TimToady> but I just rebuilt here in the last 5 min

[16:30] <TimToady> what's your architecture?

[16:30] <cmeyer> I'm building on a slightly old suse linux.

[16:30] <cmeyer> darn. I got the same error.

[16:31] <TimToady> what's the error?

[16:31] <cmeyer> ./parrot -o runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pbc runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pir

[16:31] <cmeyer> error:imcc:syntax error, unexpected $undefined

[16:31] <cmeyer>         in file 'runtime/parrot/library/Parrot/Capture_PIR.pir' line 18

[16:32] <TimToady> old binary of imcc out there somewhere?

[16:32] <cmeyer> which imcc returns nothing.

[16:33] <TimToady> hmm.

[16:33] <TimToady> you might need to hunt someone down on #parrot

[16:33] <TimToady> most of the folk here are more pugs-savvy than parrot-savvy.

[16:34] <cmeyer> I'll try there. Thanks for your help.

[16:34] <TimToady> np

[16:47] <Limbic_Region> cmeyer - not sure if anyone told you that #parrot was on a different network but it is - irc.perl.org

[16:57] *** lumi__ joined
[16:57] <cmeyer> Limbic_Region: thanks

[16:58] <kolibrie> fglock: my grammar and emitter both compile to compilable perl 5, but when I try to run them I get: Can't locate object method "digit" via package "My::Grammar"

[16:59] <kolibrie> I tried using <?digit> and \d, and both give the same error

[17:00] <kolibrie> I see that digit is defined in MiniPerl6::Perl5::Runtime, but I can't seem to make it available in My::Grammar

[17:01] <fglock> kolibrie: you have to specify MiniPerl6::Grammar::digit - mp6 doesn't have inheritance

[17:01] <kolibrie> fglock: so <?MiniPerl6::Grammar::digit> ?

[17:01] <fglock> yes

[17:02] <kolibrie> thanks

[17:05] <kolibrie> fglock: that gives me this when I try to compile to perl 5: error in Block at lib5/MiniPerl6/Grammar.pm line 14, <> line 40.

[17:05] <fglock> kolibrie: are you using '=' instead of ':=' ? this is my most common error

[17:06] <fglock> this is a 'syntax error' message

[17:06] <kolibrie> fglock: I'm not doing any assignment

[17:06] <kolibrie> there are no compile errors if I use <?digit>

[17:07] <kolibrie> changing to <?MiniPerl6::Grammar::digit> causes this error

[17:07] <fglock> oh, right - it's <?MiniPerl6::Grammar.digit>  - method call

[17:07] <kolibrie> ah, good, that worked
