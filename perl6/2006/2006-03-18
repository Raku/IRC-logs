[13:04] <pmurias> hi all

[13:05] <pmurias> ruso: I could do the Grammar refactoring if you want

[13:06] <ruoso> pmurias, nice...

[13:07] <ruoso> pmurias, the problem is that the grammar as it is today causes a lot of weird loops

[13:08] <ruoso> pmurias, we have to refactor it to reduce it

[13:08] <ruoso> pmurias, stablishing a good grammar model

[13:08] <ruoso> pmurias, please take a look at lrep-compiler/Grammar_model.txt

[13:08] <ruoso> pmurias, feel free to change it at will

[13:09] <ruoso> pmurias, then we need to implement the grammar as the plan

[13:09] <Alias_> oh for a haskell brute force optimising grammar compiler

[13:10] <ruoso> Alias_, this is for p5 lrep no optimiser :)

[13:10] <Alias_> or $something that was grammar-aware and could test variations against a sample codebase

[13:12] * ruoso implementing trace on the rules to detect the loops...

[13:32] *** Toaster|Real is now known as Ara4n

[13:33] * audreyt is (again) at very low hit points due to jet lag :/

[13:34] <audreyt> my body simply doesn't survive eastward (positive direction of TZ) jetlagging well

[13:34] <audreyt> :-/

[13:34] <Alias_> nobody does

[13:34] <Alias_> Well...

[13:34] <audreyt> yeah, but I get disabled for on avg 2~3 entire days

[13:34] <Alias_> if it's a big enough amount, you can stay up REALLY late for a few days before, then it's like going forwards

[13:34] <audreyt> very annoying :/

[13:34] * Ara4n always feels that he's hallucinating for about 3 days

[13:35] <audreyt> exactly that!

[13:35] <audreyt> it's like that yellow fungus in nethack

[13:35] <jisom> but it's bad when you actually do hallucinate

[13:35] * Alias_ has actually hallucinated

[13:35] <jisom> from sleep deprivation?

[13:35] <Alias_> On a 5 day journey from north Scotland to Lismore

[13:35] <Alias_> yep

[13:35] <Alias_> 4 and a half days

[13:35] * audreyt too, due to hallucinogetic fungus

[13:35] * Ara4n has hallucinated from sleep dep - was absolutely horrible

[13:36] <Ara4n> i convinced myself that my jacket was sodden with red ink

[13:36] <Alias_> I couldn't get the spider web off my arms

[13:36] <pmichaud> only time I had serious serious jet lag was Dallas to Tokyo -- I never recovered before returning to the U.S.

[13:36] <jisom> one of the things in psychology is not interacting with the hallucination......but what does it mean when you feel the floor to prove the meal worms aren't really there, yet you still see them?

[13:36] <Alias_> I get that one a lot when sleep deprived

[13:36] <Alias_> Not that I'm scared of spiders, but we have a lot at our place, so it's a common problem

[13:37] <Ara4n> gibson had a fairly whimsical model for jetlag in Pattern Recognition - that your soul has to catch up with your body (if you believe in such a distinction)

[13:37] <Alias_> :)

[13:38] <Ara4n> the idea of one's disembodied sense of spiritual self drifting sadly over the pacific/atlantic trying to catch up with your abnormally speedy self is appealing :)

[13:38] <Ara4n> physical self, even.

[13:39] <Alias_> And will work even once we get teleportation

[13:39] <Ara4n> hehe

[13:39] * Ara4n trundles off to $work

[13:42] * avar likes that idea

[13:43] <avar> Though that must mean that the astronaughts that went to the moon were soulless for quite some time

[13:44] <jisom> and what if you die before your soul catches up?

[13:44] <Alias_> Does your soul move faster when there's no air resistance?

[13:45] <avar> Alias_: only if it has speed holes

[13:45] <jisom> sound moves faster the more mass there is....light moves slower.....so who knows

[13:46] <Alias_> Lets invent something and say it moves based on the information density of the medium

[13:46] <Alias_> So though the ocean is slow, the air faster, earth faster again, and space really fast

[13:46] <jisom> don't forget to make it impossible to prove, so you can't be proven wrong

[13:46] <Alias_> The soul moves at a speed based on it's mood

[13:47] <Alias_> rotated based on the zodiac of the owner and the cycle of the moon

[13:47] <Alias_> plus or minus 50%

[13:47] <jisom> with the relative influence of all planets in existence

[13:53] <avar> you people have been doing drugs, haven't you?

[13:53] <Alias_> only the ones I'm told do for the safety of the community

[13:58] <pmurias> roso: i'm currently moving rules to Grammar/Rules.p6, is it ok with you?

[14:00] <ruoso> pmurias, yes...

[14:01] <ruoso> pmurias, but it will be a pita to compile it with the grammar as it is today...

[14:01] <ruoso> pmurias, it takes a lot of time

[14:01] <pmurias> I already did it..

[14:01] <ruoso> 250k match tries and counting

[14:01] <Alias_> :)

[14:01] <jisom> with trace?

[14:01] <ruoso> yes

[14:01] <pmurias> currently I'm compiling Perl6.p6

[14:02] <jisom> pge with parrot's trace?

[14:02] <ruoso> 292k is the final number

[14:02] <ruoso> jisom, no... it's in lrep

[14:02] <jisom> oh

[14:02] <ruoso> to parse Perl6.p6

[14:02] <ruoso> with the rules defined by Perl6.p6

[14:03] <ruoso> 292k match tries...

[14:03] <ruoso> its weird

[14:03] <pmurias> I tried profiling the old-lrep once

[14:03] <pmurias> the profile file was 100M+

[14:04] <ruoso> yeah... I created a set of 'print __FILE__.__LINE__ if $::trace' in the emmited code

[14:04] <ruoso> the trace is much smaller

[14:04] <ruoso> 5.8M

[14:05] <avar> parts of pugs are written in Perl 6?

[14:05] <ruoso> avar, no... it's lrep-compiler... p6 -> p5 compiler

[14:06] <ruoso> avar, it's almost self-hosting

[14:09] <pasteling> "ruoso" at 201.9.40.43 pasted "Number of tries per rule" (43 lines, 1.2K) at http://sial.org/pbot/16387

[14:27] *** Kattana joined
[14:28] * ruoso wonders how one could parse the trace to see which sequences are most repetitive...

[14:31] <Alias_> Firstly you want branch tracing surely...

[14:31] <Alias_> but I can't spare the headspace right now

[14:31] <Alias_> parsing theory and asynchronous serial events aren't similar enough :)

[14:32] <ruoso> and what if <@list>  goes modifying @list to put the most matched in the front?

[16:04] *** mako132_ joined
[16:19] <TimToady> ruoso: it's okay to optimize <@list>, of course, but the eventual plan is not to use <@list> at all, but exclusively magical <%hash>, or at least to the extent possible.

[16:19] <TimToady> .oO(That was almost English...)

[16:26] *** Arathorn joined
[16:26] <TimToady> Basically, a good <%hash> matcher should optimize its keys into a good trie or DFA matcher.  For Perl 6 we also need to be able to map that magical %hash to multiple real hashes of things like %statement_control and %prefix grammatical categories, several of which can be scanned for simultaneously through the magical <%hash> mechanism, so that we don't violate the longest token rule even if some tokens are coming from one category 

[16:33] *** KingDiamond joined
[16:41] <pmurias> It may be a question of not reading the synopsis carefully enough, but is rule custom:<foo> allowed?

[16:43] <TimToady> one way or other.

[22:34] <Limbic_Region> eric256 - I do use Windows but don't have a C compiler for it

[22:34] <Limbic_Region> well - other than Cygwin gcc

[22:34] <Limbic_Region> I do know several monks that might be a bit more helpful though

[22:36] <Limbic_Region> eric256 - I would probably bet your most interested party would be Jonathan - [email@hidden.address]
[22:37] <Limbic_Region> he is active in perl6 development (on the Parrot side)

[22:37] <eric256> cool.....wifes leading me out of the house but when i get back i'll email him...thanks
