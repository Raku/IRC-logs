[13:02] <audreyt> @tell but otherwise, no, the perl5 codegen is not default. that means when you say "1 ~~ /2/"you are calling to p5

[20:36] <ingy> rindolf: do you have a new mac?

[20:36] <rindolf> ingy: no, I don't.

[20:36] <rindolf> ingy: I only have Intel machines here.

[20:37] <rindolf> Nothing that runs OS X.

[20:37] <ingy> http://christian.web42.com/en/archives/000023.html

[20:37] <lambdabot> Title: public thoughts: How to install Pugs on Mac OS X 10.4 in 22 easy steps, http://tinyurl.com/y8fb5o

[20:37] <ingy> hahahah

[20:38] <rindolf> ingy: 22 easy steps.

[20:38] <ingy> I found a sweet ass wireless connection

[20:44] <eviltwin_b> heh

[20:57] <rindolf> OK, let's see how much Pugs' compilation strains my recently enlarged memory.

[20:57] * ingy is in Ennis Ireland

[20:58] <ingy> Ireland beat Australia in International Rules Football today

[20:58] <ingy> and the right team won the bi rugby match

[20:58] <ingy> so everyone is happy in this pub

[20:59] <ingy> although I am eventually going to get this shite beat out of me for geeking out in this place

[20:59] <ingy> hopefully I can get pugs installed first

[21:00] <eviltwin_b> heh

[21:00] * ingy downs another pint

[21:03] *** esstone joined
[21:06] <rindolf> Hmmm... ghc-6.6.x was only released this month and it's about to become a pugs requirement.

[21:07] <eviltwin_b> I got the impression pugs drove ghc 6.6 development though

[21:08] <ingy> not surprised

[21:08] <ingy> pugs drives everything

[21:08] <eviltwin_b> (to the detriment of some other Haskell-based projects...)

[21:09] <Debolaz> Hrmm.. I've been spending most of the day trying to learn haskell.

[21:09] <Debolaz> It strikes me as very bisarre, yet highly consistent.

[21:10] <Cugel> What's its inconsistence?

[21:11] <eviltwin_b> it is consistent.  it's only bizarre until you wrap your head around its way of doing things

[21:11] <Debolaz> Magical exceptions to rules. "You may always use function x except when y".

[21:12] <SamB> Cugel: what inconsistence?

[21:12] <SamB> Debolaz: what exceptions?

[21:12] <eviltwin_b> (inmy case it helps that the building next door ouses a bunch of PL theorists, so I'm already exposed to functional programming think)

[21:12] * Debolaz misread Cugel.

[21:12] <SamB> oh.

[21:12] <Debolaz> Haskell has sorta, kinda, fried my brain a bit today.

[21:12] <eviltwin_b> most of the "magical" exceptions also make sense once you understand what's going on

[21:12] <ingy> omg, perl5.8.8 is a prereq for ghc

[21:13] * SamB suspects Cugel misread Debolaz, too

[21:13] <ingy> perl5.8 rather

[21:13] <SamB> most of the "magical" exceptions are just syntactical oddities...

[21:13] <SamB> like n+k patterns

[21:13] <SamB> or the handling of -

[21:14] <SamB> the latter of which is the *worst* part of Haskell

[21:14] <mauke> yeah, they should have made (-) a normal binary function

[21:14] <SamB> of course, that leaves you with the question of how to write a negative literal

[21:15] <ingy> 0-42

[21:15] <mauke> neg 42

[21:15] <SamB> ingy: the evil mangler is written in PERL

[21:15] <eviltwin_b> hm, ISTR reading that at one point - was (relatively) normal and negative literals were prefixed with _ --- but maybe I'm confusing with ML

[21:16] <eviltwin_b> or one of the other functional languages

[21:16] <ingy> SamB: it's "Perl" my friend

[21:16] <SamB> > _1

[21:16] <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `_1'

[21:16] <SamB> ingy: whatever

[21:16] <ingy> riiight

[21:16] * SamB thinks the manpage threw him off

[21:17] * ingy needs to learn HASKELL

[21:17] <mauke> hmm, you probably want negative literals for patterns

[21:17] <SamB> I'd want them just on principle

[21:17] <mauke> what principle? no other language has them

[21:18] <SamB> really?

[21:18] <SamB> are you *certain*?

[21:18] <mauke> no :-)

[21:18] <eviltwin_b> I presume that refers to principoles, not negative literals :>

[21:18] <SamB> I'm pretty sure Self has...

[21:18] * ingy is wondering if perl will compile before his battery runs out

[21:18] <mauke> Lisp probably does, but not C or Perl

[21:18] <SamB> eviltwin_b: heh

[21:18] <SamB> eviltwin_b: no

[21:20] <ingy> I can't believe haskell deps on perl

[21:20] <ingy> or ghc rather

[21:20] <ingy> does hugs as well?

[21:21] <ingy> does ghc have a run time or just a compile time dep on perl?

[21:21] <SamB> compile time

[21:21] <mauke> compile time; it mangles the generated asm

[21:21] <ingy> can I delete the perl after I install ghc?

[21:21] <mauke> oh, that runtime

[21:22] <mauke> no

[21:22] <SamB> *that* compile time?

[21:22] <ingy> so perl is used for every time I compile foo.hs?

[21:23] <mauke> I think it's only if you compile via C; I'm not sure though

[21:23] <SamB> yeah, only for via-C

[21:23] <ingy> as ND would say "Gah!"

[21:24] <SamB> well, C's stack manipulation facilities SUCK

[21:24] <SamB> also it won't let you put code and data next to eachother

[21:24] <ingy> I hope that ghc remembers the full path to perl

[21:25] <SamB> I'm fairly certain it isn't really all that particular about the version

[21:25] <ingy> because I definitely don't want this new perl first in my PATH
