[21:29] <TimToady> we were?

[21:37] *** finchely joined
[21:41] <jdv79> will it be possible to build p5esque OO code under p6?

[21:42] <gaal> just how esque?

[21:43] <TimToady> yes, different kinds of objects can have different representation schemes and p5hash is one of them.  It's just the default is p6opaque.

[21:44] <gaal> I think the plan is to make the dispatcher pluggable too, so you can have a p5 @ISAy method resolution order if you like

[21:44] <TimToady> obviously if two different representations are related by inheritance but have different schemes, you have to emulate that with some kind of delegation or composition.

[21:44] <jdv79> cause ai showed some p6 OO code to a colleague and he had a good point that its starting to look like java;)  i think less structured/lighter-weight classes still have their uses.

[21:44] *** hcarty joined
[21:44] <gaal> jdv79: are you looking for a class to which you can add fields on the fly?

[21:45] <jdv79> that's a large part of it, yeah.

[21:45] <gaal> what else does the weight dimension relate to? perf?

[21:46] <gaal> nothingmuch and the other moose here have some ideas on making "everything is an object" not suck that way

[21:46] <TimToady> as for the "this is starting to look like langage XXX" argument, that says nothing about whether we're stealing the right ideas or the wrong ideas from language XXX.

[21:46] <gaal> * including attributes

[21:46] <jdv79> i guess what we mean is the way its very loosely coupled in p5 - methods can be called as subs, representation is dynamic, stuff like that.

[21:47] <TimToady> you can still call a method as a sub--you just have to work at it a little more.

[21:47] *** prism joined
[21:48] <TimToady> but there are really good reasons to keep subs and methods straight from each other by default.

[22:26] <gaal> TimToady: is there a context-safe _value_ in Perl 6 for nothing? That is, one that if returned, looks like the callee had said "return", but without involving a control exception in the callee?

[22:27] *** oylenshpeegul left
[22:28] <gaal> I've wanted this in p5 in the past. http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=590133 is a p6 case

[22:28] <lambdabot> Title: Re^2: 99 Problems in Perl6

[22:30] <diotalevi> Say, this is a completely random question but is there likely to be a way to manipulate the call stack in p6? I just found myself in p5 wanting to either modify my caller's @_ and force it to restart or return a value for my caller.

[22:33] <gaal> that's a scary thought, but I can see where it'd be useful

[22:34] <gaal> i wonder how far you could get with control exceptions in the general case

[22:35] <gaal> you want this w/o the cooperation of the caller, right?

[22:35] <diotalevi> Incidentally, this was because Data::Dumper allows me to have it call into an object's method which is allowed to modify the reference/object but doesn't have a return value and it can't be substituted for just an unblessed value. :-(

[22:35] <diotalevi> Yes, absolutely without any cooperation on the part of the caller.

[22:38] <diotalevi> Data::Dumper kind of sucks when feeding it overloaded objects and tied variables.

[22:39] <diotalevi> So yeah, I just hadn't recalled hearing anyone talk about p6's call stack and didn't know if that was part of the spec or not. Maybe I just heard different terms than I expected.

[22:41] <gaal> (sorry, back) yeah, ACK about the "if you need this you need it bad" nature of this feature

[22:41] <gaal> I don't recall moosing it either.

[22:42] <gaal> things like caller have very strong selectors, but not the kind of crazy mutations you're scheming.

[22:43] <gaal> (eg you can ask caller for the most recent block that had a certain label)

[22:44] <diotalevi> On p5 to *really* solve that I'd write something to walk my data prior to DD seeing it and collapse my objects or I'd use PadWalker or such to reach directly into the C.

[22:44] <diotalevi> I'm not going to bother, fwiw.

[22:45] <diotalevi> But see... when it comes to solutions like "reach into the C and tweak something" then it's murky about what happens on p6 because "the C" doesn't exist anymore. :-/
