[11:04] <audreyt> thanks :) I'd like to do ::PCR next

[11:05] <Juerd> What is that? 

[11:05] <audreyt> Pugs::Compiler::Rules

[11:05] <Juerd> Ah :)

[11:05] <audreyt> from the miniperl6 branch, hopefully

[11:06] <audreyt> so we can fulfill putter's vision :)

[11:09] <fglock> audreyt: hi!

[11:09] <audreyt> fglock: greetings!

[11:09] <audreyt> the ADSL people will come tomorrow and I may even have running water by tomorrow too! :)

[11:10] <fglock> audreyt: mp6-on-parrot is passing the current tests

[11:10] <audreyt> so, resume life-as-usual this weekend, most likely

[11:10] <audreyt> I saw the commit :) sweet

[11:10] <fglock> we all hope so :)

[11:11] <fglock> is there a difference on the way you declare class variables from instance variables? both use "has"?

[11:12] <audreyt> no

[11:12] <audreyt> classvars are "my"

[11:12] <audreyt> my $x; # classvar with no acccessor

[11:12] <audreyt> my $.x; # with accessor

[11:12] <audreyt> it's just regular scoping

[11:13] <audreyt> the sugar is there to make accessors only

[12:20] <nwc10> yeah, right.

[12:23] <audreyt> that's very forward-looking

[12:23] <nwc10> or very buzzword desparate

[12:24] <audreyt> I've been wrestling with Rico and Scriptaculous and Comet all week, though

[12:24] <audreyt> so I have sympathy with their reqs :)

[15:27] <cognominal> in S06  sub traverse ( NAry $top ( :kids [$eldest, *@siblings] ) ) { # should not that be *$eldest? or is the * optional in that cas?

[15:27] <cognominal> s/cas/case/

[15:29] <cognominal> anyway I like all that pattern matching,  it kills a lot of structural code

[15:33] <cognominal> it sounds like optional to  me b : $eldest cannot be a parameter because []  matches an array

[15:33] <fglock> cognominal: I think *$eldest makes it 'optional', while $eldest is 'required'

[19:52] <pmurias> i'm currently in the procces of making my christmas wishlist, does anyone have any reacommendations besides READTHEM?

[19:56] <pmurias> is "Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages" much more difficult than "Types And Programming Languages"?

[19:57] <qmole> wouldnt have thought so, just more of the same

[19:57] <pmurias> and is it as fun?

[19:58] <pmurias> * as much fun

[20:25] *** trym__ joined
[20:28] <cognominal> pmurias, I have not gone thru it yet, but I feel it is the logical complement of TAOPL

[20:28] <cognominal> Both are very useful if one want to read papers about type theory

[20:29] *** Lorn_ joined
[20:29] <cognominal> Qualifed types by Mark P.Jones is a thinner book but a must have too

[20:31] <cognominal> It is refferred by many papers of SPJ.

[20:31] <cognominal> not that I understand them yet...

[20:34] <pmurias> TAOPL meaning TAPL

[20:34] <pmurias> ?

[20:35] <gaal> pmurias: ask for the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Much fun, astounding writing.

[20:35] <gaal> not much to do with Haskell though. :)

[20:36] <cognominal> oops. yes I meant TAPL
