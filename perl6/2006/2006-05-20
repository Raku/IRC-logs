[04:29] <YetAnotherEric> anyone know of a perl5 attempt at given/when that doesn't use source filters?

[04:30] <YetAnotherEric> I saw Damian's Switch.pm

[04:30] <YetAnotherEric> http://scratchcomputing.com/tmp/given_when.pl (just a first hack at syntactic sugar)

[04:31] *** justatheory joined
[04:32] <YetAnotherEric> now I guess I just need to steal Damian's if() and $::_S_W_I_T_C_H = statements

[04:34] <azuroth> hmm. leet

[04:36] <YetAnotherEric> I suppose it could have {} instead of [] if when did something inside-outish to allow for the flattening of hash keys

[04:37] <azuroth> interesting

[04:48] <audreyt> YetAnotherEric: Perl 5.9 has it builtin.

[04:49] <audreyt> use feature 'switch';

[04:49] <audreyt> # http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl-5.9.3/lib/feature.pm

[04:58] *** justatheory joined
[05:00] <YetAnotherEric> cool.  is this bolt-on too horrid for pre-5.9?

[05:02] *** Quell joined
[05:02] <YetAnotherEric> and what happens to i18n when ~~ comes into play? :-(

[05:02] <beppu> how would that affect i18n ?

[05:05] <YetAnotherEric> print ~~"Hello, $world";

[05:06] <YetAnotherEric> I guess the parser will get over that ok.

[05:07] <beppu> YetAnotherEric: I didn't know there was an i18n pragma.  (http://search.cpan.org/~autrijus/i18n-0.07/)  It doesn't seem compatible with smart match, does it?

[05:08] <YetAnotherEric> well, if one is binary and the other unary, that should work

[05:08] * YetAnotherEric thinks smartmatch is binary anyway

[05:09] <beppu> but then when it sees you trying to use it like a unary operator, what'll happen?

[05:09] <beppu> Someone who has perl 5.9.3+ should try it out.

[05:09] <YetAnotherEric> string negation (or overloaded if use i18n is on)

[05:10] <beppu> Does i18n actually overload ~ ?

[05:10] <YetAnotherEric> that's how I understand it, at least to the extent that I understand it.

[05:11] <beppu> I guess it does... (just checked source)

[05:11] <beppu> That's some clever shit.  ;-)

[05:11] <YetAnotherEric> :-)

[05:11] <beppu> In light of that, we may have gotten lucky.  Perhaps both forms of ~~ can co-exist.

[05:12] <beppu> (maybe...)

[05:27] <audreyt> it could

[05:27] <audreyt> and where it couldn't i18n.pm is a far less worthy cause :)

[05:27] <audreyt> in $job I happiuly use _()...

[05:27] <audreyt> (it's Jifty::I18N's default loc() function)

[05:27] <audreyt> automatically exported to all packages, because that's what &_ does in perl5.

[05:28] <audreyt> i18n.pm is one of those audrey-ingy collaborations that warps perl5, but it's among the less successful ones :)

[05:38] <beppu> I didn't know it existed.

[05:39] <beppu> I'm not on IRC all the time, so it's hard to stay current with what's new.

[05:46] <audreyt> it's 2004 :)

[05:46] <audreyt> bbiab

[05:51] <beppu> ;)

[05:52] <YetAnotherEric> _() is less popular in my book

[05:53] <YetAnotherEric> beppu, you have to read CPAN 4 hours per day to keep up

[05:54] <beppu> I just subscribed to the new modules rss feed.  I should have done this a long time ago.

[06:21] <victori> so pugs is ahead of parrot in perl6 implementation?

[06:28] <azuroth> I thought pugs _was_ the parrot implementation..?

[06:29] <azuroth> for now, at least

[06:33] <arcady> there's so many implementations that it's hard to keep track what does what

[06:34] <arcady> but pugs I think is the most complete perl 6 to parrot compiler

[06:41] <YetAnotherEric> compiler?  I thought it was a runtime.

[06:41] <YetAnotherEric> parrot is parrot right?

[06:42] <azuroth> pugs is a compiler with multiple backends: the default just runs it
