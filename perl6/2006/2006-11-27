[00:07] <froggero1> hey does anyone know where to find some good documentation about creating perl modules and how that process works... dealing with the makefile and all that jazz, as well as modifying exsisting modules?

[00:08] <mugwump> for perl 5 or 6?

[00:08] <froggero1> probably 5 to start, are there many changes?

[00:08] <froggero1> (the only reason I say 5 is because that's what mac's ship with :p)

[00:08] <mugwump> perl 6 is a complete redesign

[00:09] <froggero1> what would you suggest?

[00:09] <froggero1> which is easier to work with, having no knowledge of either system

[00:09] <mugwump> 5 has more documentation and examples... depends if you feel like being an early adopter I guess

[00:10] <mugwump> some people are making real applications with perl 6 already, and an early perl 6 alpha is due soon

[00:10] <froggero1> hmm...

[00:10] <mugwump> did you find the perlmod* manual pages in the perl 5 distro?

[00:11] <froggero1> I haven't even started looking for docs yet, still finishing my morning cofee :)

[00:12] <Debolaz> Now to figure out a genious way of keeping and passing around config stuff in my script.

[00:13] <froggero1> eh... just started touching on the subject of perl6... looks like it's a little conviluted to get it installed on os x

[00:13] <froggero1> so, let's just say that we're looking for perl5 documentation for mods ;)

[00:13] <froggero1> that's preferably not a man page

[00:14] <wolverian> either use the perldoc tool (perldoc perlmod), or perldoc.perl.org

[00:16] <Debolaz> What's the "right" way to load a module runtime? Still eval "use $module"? 

[00:22] <mugwump> require $module works, too

[00:27] <froggero1> http://mathforum.org/~ken/perl_modules.html looks like some alright docs

[01:12] <alexi5> when is perl 6 going to take over perl 5

[01:19] <Tene> Tomorrow, actually.

[01:19] <Tene> You're one day too early.

[01:26] <GeJ> alexi5: the release plan says Christmas. Unfortunately, due to network issues, the document got corrupted, and the actual year of the release got lost on the Interweb.

[01:27] <GeJ> but I was told that the perl.org admins are working on this and try to get the missing bits back.

[02:32] <Debolaz> I guess this might sound stupid, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to dereference a hash.

[02:34] <eviltwin_b> %myhash = (...); say %myhash<string>

[02:34] <eviltwin_b> (for literal string)

[02:34] <eviltwin_b> {} like in perl5 for an expression

[02:36] <Debolaz> Well, I'm trying to pass a hash reference to a constructor (Configuration data). submethod BUILD ($config); This takes input from "filename".slurp.eval(:lang<yaml>);

[02:38] <eviltwin_b> if it's a hash reference stored in a scalar then it's e.g. $config<string> or $config{expression}

[03:59] <froggero1> um... wait, what if my POD's inside the mod?

[03:59] <audreyt> froggero1: still works

[03:59] <froggero1> cool

[03:59] <eviltwin_b> then feed it the module, the pod tools handle that

[03:59] <froggero1> just use the .pm then?

[04:00] <audreyt> Debolaz: er sorry. %()

[04:00] <audreyt> %$foo %(..expr..)

[04:02] <Debolaz> This was eventually figured out once I discovered that <> did not do what I thought it did.

[04:03] <audreyt> what is this <>?

[04:04] <Debolaz> obj.method(:argument<literal>)

[04:04] *** chaos joined
[04:05] <audreyt> aha. you want :moose(expr)

[04:05] <Debolaz> I opted with the more familiar and not as frightening argument => foo :)

[04:06] <audreyt> timtowtdi...

[04:07] <Debolaz> So it turns out I actually had the hash dereferencing right the first time but I was passing a literal string instead of a hash reference.

[04:08] <Debolaz> Hopefully I'll get a little bit better, this is my first serious perl 6 project, a package manager for multiple backends.

[04:09] <audreyt> oooh

[04:22] <Debolaz> my $pm = PM.new; my $xchat_package = $pm.find('xchat'); $xchat_package.install; Or one can use $pm to manage packages on the system: $pm.want($xchat_package); $pm.sync;

[14:15] <araujo> that's with , sh configure

[14:15] <Limbic_Region> araujo - OSX ?

[14:15] <araujo> no, gnu/linux

[14:16] <Limbic_Region> you are trying to compile GHC then not pugs, sorry I misunderstood

[14:16] <araujo> uh?

[14:16] <Limbic_Region> you may need autoconf

[14:17] <araujo> i already got ghc6.6 installed

[14:17] <Limbic_Region> ok - so pugs should be perl Makefile.pl; make

[14:17] <Limbic_Region> no sh configure necessary

[14:18] <araujo> mm...

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> araujo - ok, after having read the logs you didn't describe what your problem was - just that you were having one

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> so - after ensuring that ghc and perl5 are both in your path

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> it should be as simple as

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> perl Makefile.PL 

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> make

[14:19] <Limbic_Region> if those steps are failing, please nopaste

[14:21] <araujo> well, i keep getting that Setup error ...

[14:22] <Limbic_Region> araujo - and where did you get your pugs from? - latest from repo or from CPAN or ???

[14:23] <Limbic_Region> I compile it every day (sometimes multiple times)

[14:23] <araujo> i'll do that now.

[14:24] <Limbic_Region> and if you check the smoke reports, the last linux smoke was for r14842

[16:29] <Limbic_Region> araujo?

[16:32] <Limbic_Region> @tell araujo Your problem is simple, your GHC doesn't have the extra-libs (Setup: cannot satisfy dependency network-any).  If I had thought to ask for a nopaste earlier I would have seen it.  If you built yourself you need to add the extra-libs before compiling - binary versions should have them included (at least for Win32).

[19:32] <PerlJam> fglock: where can I read more on mp6?  just the docs in pugs?

[19:32] <PerlJam> (or code)

[19:34] <fglock> PerlJam: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-MiniPerl6/ - there are several .pod files

[19:34] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 14848: /v6/v6-MiniPerl6

[19:34] <[particle]> fglock: what's currently using mp6?

[19:35] <PerlJam> fglock: in general my opinion would be that you NOT implement D  :-)

[19:35] <fglock> [particle]: it is not used yet, it is only used by itself

[19:36] <fglock> PerlJam: any particular reason?

[19:36] <PerlJam> fglock: purely selfish reasons.  I  think that the parrot bootstrap or mp6-mo have more promise in the big picture.

[19:36] <[particle]> how about bc on mp6?

[19:37] <fglock> PerlJam: ok

[19:37] <PerlJam> fglock: if I had my druthers, I'd ask you to finish the parrot bootstrap.  But no real logic behind that either :-)

[19:37] <[particle]> pmichaud and i are working on languages/abc/ in parrot, if that could use mp6 it'd give us a good example of what mp6 can do for compilers

[19:38] <[particle]> s/s$/ writers/

[19:38] <PerlJam> [particle]: It would be good to see a direct comparison between the two approaches there.  

[19:38] <[particle]> pj: precisely

[19:39] <[particle]> right now, neither pm or i can see how to use mp6... that's a problem

[19:39] <[particle]> an example (any example even) would help

[19:39] <[particle]> but bc seems like a good fit to me

[19:39] <fglock> [particle]: mp6 is implemented in mp6 :)

[19:40] <PerlJam> the AST reminds me of pascal for some reason

[19:40] <[particle]> yes, i know, but a less twisted^W^W more concrete example might help

[19:41] <[particle]> or, translating parrot ast to mp6 ast would be a good example, too

[19:42] <fglock> audreyt could answer best - the "tree-transformations" was her idea

[19:42] <[particle]> i have a dream of tcl on js

[19:43] <PerlJam> fglock: what's with the double-$ everywhere?

[19:43] <[particle]> fglock: okay, i'll ask audreyt whenever we're both around

[19:47] <pmurias> fglock: are there any particular reasons you want to make a D implementation?

[19:47] <fglock> pmurias: audreyt said it would be cool

[19:47] <TimToady> she says that about a lot of things.  :)

[19:53] <PerlJam> fglock: if you want my opinion, I'd say finish the parrot boostrap and then work on a version of bc that uses mp6 as an analog to tge

[19:54] <TimToady> that makes a lot of sense to me too.

[19:56] <fglock> PerlJam: the plan for MP6 is to use it for bootstrapping more complex versions of MP6 itself

[19:57] <fglock> I don't see how implementing bc would help

[19:57] <PerlJam> fglock: it wouldn't help *you* necessarily, but it would help pmichaud and particle :)

[19:58] <TimToady> one of the goals here is to get the MP6 and the TGE teams to start saying "ooh, shiny" to each other.

[19:59] <fglock> TimToady: that makes sense

[20:00] <[particle]> right now i'm saying, "hey it works on windows! *phew* but what's it good for?"

[20:01] <fglock> in this case, how about implementing TGE in MP6

[20:02] <[particle]> what i'd like is to see a perl6ish syntax to do tree transformations

[20:02] <[particle]> using parrot ast

[20:02] <TimToady> whatever it takes for them to continue converging...

[20:02] <PerlJam> indeed, convergence is good

[20:03] <pmichaud> the problem with "implement TGE in MP6" is that TGE grammars are still heavily PIR based

[20:03] <pmichaud> we're still looking for a good tree transformation syntax

[20:03] <[particle]> yes, of course it's also a goal to make tge grammar less pir-based

[20:04] <fglock> TimToady: does "Matching against non-strings" in S05 could have something to do with tree transformations?

[20:04] <TimToady> I was using "TGE" to refer generically to present and future syntaxes.

[20:04] <TimToady> fglock: yes

[20:04] <TimToady> and in particular binding tree nodes to subsignatures

[20:04] <pmichaud> TimToady: (TGE) Yes, I took it that way :-)

[20:05] <TimToady> that plus decent constructor syntax is about all you need for tree transforms.

[20:07] <fglock> binding tree nodes to subsignatures is like: sub foo ( ::Tree $top (:$left, :$right) ) { ... } ?

[20:08] <TimToady> I think something MP6-ish is very close to what Parrot needs.

[20:08] <TimToady> fglock: yes

[20:08] <TimToady> can also be used with smart matching.

[20:09] <TimToady> (though how that declares things is a good question...)

[20:09] *** jferrero joined
[20:12] <TimToady> might need a "when" variant that matches if the parameters to its block bind successfully.

[20:12] <TimToady> maybe "when -> $a, $b {...}" or some such

[20:12] <TimToady> except that's ambiguous with current notation

[20:13] <TimToady> hmm, or maybe it just works if you add an empty block after:

[20:14] <TimToady> when -> $a, $b {...} {}

[20:14] *** weinig joined
[20:15] <PerlJam> I'm still trying to wrap my mind around things.  Someone set me striaght.  "tree transform" sounds like it could be "capturing" and "currying"   And "signatures" sound like "tree node"  or something like that.

[20:16] <PerlJam> I feel like there's an idea on the tip of my brain that just won't come out.

[20:16] * [particle] notes PerlJam has a pointy brain

[20:17] <PerlJam> At least it's not smooth!

[20:22] <lambdabot> araujo is in #perl6, #gentoo-haskell, #haskell and #Haskell. I last heard araujo speak 4h 3s ago.

[20:25] <fglock> TimToady: how about 'when ::Tree $_ (:$left, :$right) {...}'

[20:26] <fglock> 'when hash $_ (:$left, :$right) {...}'

[20:27] <fglock> even: 'when .hash(:$left, :$right) {...}'

[21:01] <stevan_> [particle]: what is bc?

[21:02] <[particle]> basic calculator

[21:02] <stevan_> ah

[21:02] <[particle]> man bc

[21:20] <pmichaud> I have a question about t/01-sanity/07-tailcall.t

[21:20] <pmichaud> 07-tailcall.t has the line:       &baz.goto("param1", "param2");

[21:21] <pmichaud> it's pretty obvious what this does, but is the 'goto' method defined anywhere in the Synopses?

[21:22] <Limbic_Region> grrr - disconnected?

[21:22] <Limbic_Region> pmichaud - cd docs/Perl6/spec; grep goto *.pod

[21:22] <Limbic_Region> there

[21:23] <Limbic_Region> it appears goto is mentioned most in S04 

[21:23] <Limbic_Region> Blocks and Statements

[21:23] <pmichaud> I think that's "goto LABEL", not "goto" as a method on a sub

[21:23] <Limbic_Region> there is one mention in S06 

[21:24] <pmichaud> I think the S06 mention is compiler-implementation detail

[21:24] <Limbic_Region> right

[21:24] * Limbic_Region was just pulling all references to "goto" from the synopses

[21:24] <[particle]> there's a goto sub op reference in S10, but not a definition, and no method syntax mentions

[21:25] <pmichaud> (yes, I already did grep 'goto' on the synopses and apocalypses)

[21:25] <[particle]> ...grep is so last century...

[21:25] <pmichaud> okay, I lied, I did 'ack'

[21:25] <[particle]> :)

[21:25] <pmichaud> I meant 'grep' the verb, not 'grep' the last century tool

[21:28] <eviltwin_b> grep is dead, long live grep?

[23:25] <Juerd> PerlJam: You could of course run "top" and contact people who overload feather yourself... :)

[23:25] <Juerd> I didn't limit resources, so non-root can also see this kind of info :)

[23:30] <wolverian> can you see what process it was after the fact?

[23:30] <wolverian> s/you/I/ # :)

[23:44] <[particle]> wolverian: Juerd probably won't see that unless you mention him by name :)

[23:44] <[particle]> so he should catch it now

[23:44] <wolverian> thanks. :)

[23:46] <Juerd> wolverian: No

[23:47] <Juerd> [particle]: It even has to be the first word for it to highlight. I'm mentioned too often :(

[23:47] <wolverian> Juerd, I'll try to be more proactive, then. thanks.

[23:47] * Juerd does occasional /lastlog's, though

[23:47] <[particle]> juerd: thanks for the hint :)

[23:47] <wolverian> (or rather, to react faster.)

[23:48] <Juerd> By the way. Is my impression correct that Perl 6 development and discussion are not so active at the moment?

[23:49] * Juerd hasn't had much energy for the project, but fears that this is true for many more people

[23:49] <[particle]> ENOAUDREY flag needs to be cleared, i think
