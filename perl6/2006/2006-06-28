[01:29] * audreyt cheerleads for v6.pm

[01:29] <fglock> re v6.pm - it could already execute a trimmed-down Test.pm (w/o variable typing)

[01:30] <audreyt> parse type and drop them

[01:30] <audreyt> that's what I did

[01:30] <audreyt> you can do it too :)

[01:30] <audreyt> fglock: will you be around on thursday~sunday

[01:30] <audreyt> during the hackathon?

[01:30] <fglock> cheating is soo easy :)

[01:30] <audreyt> there will likely to be an influx to #perl6

[01:31] <fglock> I hope so

[01:31] <audreyt> cheating is the best way to get things done

[01:31] <audreyt> the house of card is a noble house

[01:31] <audreyt> but seriously, a type annotation has three effects (compile time storage allocation; compile time typecheck; runtime constraint)

[01:31] <audreyt> you can't do all of them at this moment trivially

[01:31] <audreyt> so it's best to parse them anyway

[01:31] <audreyt> and handle the parse later

[01:32] <fglock> ok

[01:32] <fglock> I'm trying to do without a compile-time env - but full-Moose will need it

[01:33] <audreyt> you will need it if you are to implement proper importing

[01:33] <audreyt> or BEGIN block

[01:33] <audreyt> so it's doomed

[01:33] <audreyt> but comp-time env with p5 is particularly easy

[01:33] <audreyt> as you just reuse the p5 stashes

[01:34] <fglock> I could use 'local', right?

[01:34] <audreyt> yes.

[01:34] <fglock> does local interacts cleanly with threads?

[01:34] <audreyt> you can also clear stash at end of compilation

[01:34] <audreyt> I believe so, even with shared vars

[01:34] <fglock> how?

[01:35] <audreyt> %Namespace:: = ();

[01:35] <fglock> !

[01:35] <audreyt> sub f { 5 }

[04:12] <markstos> I tried installing v6.pm, but there appears to be some kind of bootstrapping problem: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20152

[04:12] <lambdabot> Title: "#20152: can&#39;t find own compile method"

[04:14] <markstos> So then I thought I try compiling pugs, but Mandriva has a GHC 6.4 RPM, but the ChangeLog says I need 6.5.... this just became a little more involved than I was hoping.

[04:19] <cmarcelo> markstos: you don't need GHC 6.5 for compiling pugs.

[04:20] <cmarcelo> markstos: and you don't need pugs to use v6.pm as far as i know...

[04:21] <markstos> cmarcelo: I realized I didn't need pugs to try v6.pm-- I was just trying to different approach to try Perl6.

[04:21] <markstos> The ChangeLog says: "Removed support for GHC 6.4.0 and added support for GHC 6.5"

[04:22] <markstos> It looks like I've having a problem compiling pugs anyway: "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp"   I'll take another look at INSTALL and see if it mentions something related.

[04:22] <wolverian> markstos, that is 6.4.0, not the 6.4 series

[04:24] <cmarcelo> <markstos> I tried installing v6.pm, but there appears to be some kind of bootstrapping problem: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20152

[04:24] <fglock> markstos: ping

[04:24] <markstos> fglock: I'm here. Hello!

[04:25] <fglock> did you run Pugs::Compiler::Rule Makefile.PL? this is needed to bootstrap the part of the compiler that is written in p6

[04:25] <svnbot6> r10961 | fglock++ | v6.pm - sub names are mangled;

[04:25] <svnbot6> r10961 | fglock++ | - detailed signature parsing;

[04:25] <svnbot6> r10961 | fglock++ | - added 'use v6-pugs' to Test.pm

[04:25] <svnbot6> r10961 | fglock++ | - Test.pm emits completely! - doesn't run yet, needs more operators

[04:25] <clkao> (!)

[04:25] <clkao> fglock++

[04:25] <clkao> did you fix the pod parsing as well? ;)

[04:26] <markstos> fglock: I'll try again now.

[04:26] <fglock> clkao: I removed to pod; didn't try

[04:27] <fglock> clkao: there are some operators missing in the emitter, so most subs will not run

[04:27] <clkao> lol

[04:27] <clkao> is it correct to remove the pod?

[04:28] <fglock> I'll fix the pod later :)

[04:28] <fglock> I removed the pod in my local copy only

[04:28] <clkao> XD

[04:29] <clkao> fglock: i got lost how to make grammer/pod parse everything correctly.

[04:29] <clkao> even the current one with =begin doesn't really work, i tried to change the pod in test.pm to use =begin and =cut

[04:29] <clkao> s/cut/end

[04:29] <clkao> anyway, great work!

[04:31] <markstos> fglock: I tried again: It still doesn't pass "make test"-- it fails the same way not finding the compile() method.

[04:31] <fglock> does Pugs::Compiler::Rule pass?

[04:33] <markstos> flock: No there are lots of failures, starting with: "Can't locate object method "rule" via package "Pugs::Grammar::Rule"

[04:34] <markstos> Would you like me to post something more complete?

[04:34] <markstos> I sent something to cpantesters, but I don't think it's gone through yet.

[04:34] <fglock> one sec...

[04:37] <fglock> you should have 2 files in lib/Pugs/Grammar/Rule/ - the .pmc file must have a newer date

[04:37] * markstos looks

[04:38] <markstos> Yes, I have them both, and .pmc is newer.

[04:40] <fglock> what message you get with: perl -MPugs::Grammar::Rule -e 42

[04:42] <markstos> Can't locate object method "rule" via package "Pugs::Grammar::Rule" at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Pugs/Compiler/Regex.pm line 52

[04:43] <markstos> but I see that: "/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Pugs/Grammar/Rule/Rule.pmc" exists, and passes "perl -cw "

[04:44] <fglock> sorry, did you type Pugs::Compiler::Rule instead of Pugs::Grammar::Rule?

[04:45] <markstos> fglock: I checked, and I did not. I copy/pasted the command you wanted me to run.

[04:46] <markstos> I

[04:46] <markstos> I'm using Mandriva Linux 2006--- nothing too special about my Perl install.

[04:46] <markstos> fglock: Thanks for your help with this!

[04:46] <markstos> I was just hoping to be able to play with Perl6 a little.

[04:47] <fglock> Pugs::Grammar::Rule doesn't use Pugs::Compiler::Rule - weird message

[04:47] <markstos> I was a little surprised to find no one is making Pugs binaries for Linux, at least that I found through pugscode.org

[04:47] <fglock> there is a debian distribution

[04:49] <markstos> When I try compiling Perl6::Pugs, I get "cannot find -lgmp"

[04:50] <markstos> Oh well, it seems like my Perl6 experiment wasn't meant to be this week!

[04:50] <fglock> I'm sorry, I can't help with the v6 problem - would you try later? there will be more people around - audreyt and ingy maybe

[04:50] <Captain_Fourier> markstos, what distro you need binaries for

[04:51] <fglock> and there will be a pugs hackathon by the end of the week

[04:51] <markstos> Mandriva Linux.

[04:52] <markstos> fglock: I appreciate your help! The Perl6-on-Perl5 concept is really amazing.

[04:52] <markstos> Captain_Fourier: but other RPM-based distros would probably work, or even a staticly linked binary...

[04:52] <fglock> markstos: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/pugs - maybe you can install this

[04:52] <lambdabot> Title: "Debian -- pugs"

[04:53] <Captain_Fourier> hmm

[04:57] <fglock> markstos: as a last resort, try renaming the non-pmc file, so that perl can only find the pmc - but I think the problem is actually in another place

[04:59] <fglock> does this work? perl -MPugs::Grammar::Rule::Rule -e 42

[04:59] <fglock> that's the pmc file

[05:00] <markstos> It turns out 6.2.9 was already packaged for Mandriva, and that was easy to install, so I'm happy.

[05:00] * markstos looks into fglock's question

[05:01] <markstos> fglock: No: "Can't locate object method "rule" via package "Pugs::Grammar::Rule" at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Pugs/Compiler/Regex.pm line 52."

[05:01] <Captain_Fourier> markstos, good stuff

[05:01] <Captain_Fourier> what kept you from finding it

[05:02] <markstos> Is the namespace wrong there? Is there an issue with "::Rule" versus "::Rule::Rule"  ?

[05:03] <fglock> Rule::Rule is the main Grammar file for Rules; it is called from ::Rule

[05:04] <fglock> .

[05:05] <fglock> but the error message just don't make any sense - it is about another file

[05:06] <pasteling> "markstos" at 75.22.29.118 pasted "fglock: full error" (8 lines, 760B) at http://sial.org/pbot/18048

[05:07] <markstos> fglock: I thought more error context would be helpful.

[05:08] <fglock> cool - I think I found the problem - one sec.

[05:10] <fglock> moving Rule/Rule.pl out of the way may fix it - would you try?

[05:10] *** jmacclure joined
[05:12] <fglock> actually, no - because Rule.pmc tests the checksum

[05:12] <fglock> mmm

[05:14] <fglock> the problem is that Rule/Rule.pl has a 'use v6-pugs' line - this should not have been executed, but it was - it should only happen if the file date was wrong

[05:15] <fglock> how about force installing Pugs::Compiler::Rule again

[05:15] <markstos> OK. I'll try that.

[05:17] <fglock> your compiler is not bootstrapped - Perl 6 needs Perl 6 to work :)

[05:17] <markstos> I tried, but "make install" reported that every file was "unchanged", so nothing different happened.

[05:17] <markstos> fglock: It seemed like a kind of bootstrapping issue, but I wasn't sure what to do about it.

[05:18] <fglock> try rm the files, so that it can fix the file dates

[05:19] <markstos> fglock: I rm'ed the pmc file, and that made it get re-installed, but the error remains.

[05:19] <fglock> can you rm both files?

[05:20] <fglock> and Makefile.PL again

[05:20] <fglock> then make install

[05:22] <markstos> fglock, I'm sure what the second file you have in mind is? Is it something that "make distclean" would miss ?

[05:23] <fglock> Rule.pl and Rule.pmc in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/Pugs/Grammar/Rule/

[05:25] <markstos> fglock: I did as you requested, and the issue persists.

[05:26] <markstos> fglock: Do you have the same kind of setup, with these modules installed into your system Perl tree?

[05:26] <fglock> yes

[05:26] <markstos> because I noticed some "use lib" lines in the source that required some relative paths, that seemed like they might work differently for the developers than most people.

[05:27] <fglock> it should work without that

[05:28] <fglock> I've got a computer with RedHat - I'll try installing the modules there, later

[11:14] <audreyt> markstos's reported bug was because Mandriva was the only distro to have turned off .pmc support temporariy

[11:14] <audreyt> if he had upgraded to latest perl prepared by rgs then the problem should go away

[11:14] <audreyt> rgs: is that correct?

[11:15] <rgs> depends on the version of mdv

[11:15] <audreyt> "2006" he says

[11:15] <rgs> I don't think there was an update for this one

[11:15] <audreyt> hm.

[11:16] <audreyt> is one planned/possible, or should I tell him to build his own perl?

[11:16] <audreyt> and which one of mdv version can be upgraded to fix?

[11:16] <rgs> the policy is that for base packages ("main") only security fixes gets updates

[11:17] <rgs> or heavy bug fixes

[11:17] <audreyt> that's understandable

[11:17] <audreyt> so what should I tell markstos?

[11:17] <rgs> he can rebuild the rpm quite easily, iirc he just has to delete something from the ccflags

[15:13] <audreyt> I really wonder if we should cleanup perl5/ and move misc/pX/Common/ there to save typing

[15:13] <stevan> it would be easier to find there :)

[15:13] <audreyt> the X in pX in particular is hard on my fingers

[15:13] <audreyt> since it can't be autocompleted

[15:14] <audreyt> fglock: thoughts? :)

[15:14] <fglock> I'm ok with that - maybe update the links in the blog too

[15:14] <fglock> please do :)

[15:14] <audreyt> okie

[15:15] <stevan> ok,.. I am going with nothingmuch for some breakfast

[15:15] <fglock> stevan: did it work?

[15:15] <stevan> fglock++ # very very nice

[15:15] <fglock> thanks!

[15:15] <stevan> fglock: I had to remove my pugs checkout recently, so I cant test it at the moment

[15:16] <stevan> also,.. I am very hungry and nothingmuch will kill me if I dont get off the computer

[15:16] <stevan> but I will look when I return :)

[15:16] <fglock> stevan: it is in cpan - you can download moose.pl from the web repo

[15:16] <fglock> 'install v6-pugs'

[15:16] <stevan> yes, but I will need a fresh pugs checkout for the hackathon ;)

[15:17] <stevan> bbiab

[15:17] <fglock> audreyt: Test.pm compiles, but there are still some problems with Perl::Tidy and unimplemented ops

[15:18] <audreyt> woot

[15:19] <fglock> I'm working to make your talk obsolete :)

[15:20] <fglock> just kidding

[15:26] <stevan> the naked ingy moose,.. that one is a little disturbing

[15:26] <clkao> XD

[15:26] <stevan> its actually more of a strip tease

[15:37] *** aufrank joined
[15:42] <aufrank> a build issue:  HsSyck and fps are rebuilt with each make and make install, but on OSX 10.3.9 I need to run ranlib on the libraries before the make can finish successfully

[15:42] <aufrank> so I end up running ranlib on those archives in another terminal while the make is going on

[15:43] <aufrank> because if I do the ranlib after the make has failed, the libraries just get rebuilt when I run make again so the ranlib doesn't stick

[18:48] <rindolf> Hi all!

[18:48] <rindolf> TimToady: here?

[18:48] <rindolf> audreyt: here?

[18:48] <rindolf> gaal: here?

[18:48] <rindolf> anybody: here?

[18:48] <rindolf> rindolf: here?

[18:48] <rindolf> I'd better stop "spamming" the channel.

[18:49] <Aankhen``> I'm sorry, I'm not here right now. :-(

[18:50] <ZuluOne> me neither

[18:57] <rindolf> Lightning Talks?

[18:58] <rindolf> There's both Lightning and Lightening. English is crazy.

[18:58] <Aankhen``> Lightening is probably a typo.

[18:58] <Aankhen``> Unless you're talking about the verb lighten.

[18:59] <ZuluOne> indeed

[18:59] <rindolf> Aankhen``: I know. But it's still an English word.

[18:59] * Aankhen`` nods.

[18:59] <rindolf> Which most spell-checkers don't catch.

[19:00] <rindolf> Some people I know made this mistake, and it even had this confused.

[19:00] * rindolf is Israeli.

[19:00] <rindolf> Aankhen``: do you know szabgab?

[19:00] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[19:00] <Aankhen``> I'm afraid not.

[19:00] <rindolf> Gabor Szabo, that is?

[19:01] <rindolf> Aankhen``: well, he's a Hungrian-Israeli who sort of did a benevolent hijack of the Israeli Perl Mongers from gaal.

[19:01] <Aankhen``> Oh, I see.

[19:01] <rindolf> Aankhen``: but he started the monthly meetings, and the YAPC's (now OSDC's etc.)

[19:01] <Aankhen``> Okay.

[19:02] <rindolf> Aankhen``: he did a lot for the mongers.

[19:02] <Aankhen``> Kewl.

[19:03] <rindolf> He's now a Perl/Web/QA/Subversion consultant (or is he a contractor) and trainer.

[19:03] <rindolf> He's very busy now.

[19:03] <Aankhen``> Wah.

[19:03] <Aankhen``> Very active.

[19:03] <rindolf> I think I he gave me the root password to perl.org.il, but I'm not sure.

[19:03] <rindolf> Did you hear about Test::Live?

[19:03] <Aankhen``> I don't think so...

[19:04] <rindolf> We added tests to one of Alias' modules on an Israel.pm meeting.

[19:04] <Aankhen``> Neat.

[19:04] <rindolf> Also some comments in the code, where we said "What the hell are we supposed to do?"

[19:04] <rindolf> I like interactive sessions.

[19:04] <rindolf> Well not exactly "WTH?" but along these lines.

[19:05] <Aankhen``> Hehe.

[19:05] <rindolf> I think some of the Linux kernel source is very funny.

[19:05] <Aankhen``> Alright, I really need to crash.

[19:05] <rindolf> Aankhen``: bye.

[19:05] <Aankhen``> I'll catch up with you guys in the morning.

[19:05] <Aankhen``> G'night.

[19:05] <Aankhen``> A pleasure talking to you, as always. :-)

[19:06] <rindolf> Hi ZuluOne

[19:06] <rindolf> ZuluOne: are you a Pugs hacker?

[19:06] <ZuluOne> not exactly

[19:06] <ZuluOne> more of a lurker

[19:07] <ZuluOne> in fact, s/not exactly/no/

[19:07] <rindolf> ZuluOne: OK.

[19:07] <rindolf> ZuluOne: got any CPAN modules or anything FOSSie?

[19:07] <rindolf> ZuluOne: not that I'll hold it against you if you do.

[19:07] <ZuluOne> define "got"

[19:08] <rindolf> There's an Israeli BSD contributor who's flaming people for not contributing enough, or that their code is GPL, or that they are "bad programmers".

[19:08] <rindolf> ZuluOne: he thinks 95% of the code is in the bottom 5%.

[19:08] <rindolf> ZuluOne: do you have a PAUSE ID?

[19:09] <ZuluOne> I worked on enlightenment a few years ago; more recently POV-Ray and TA Spring.

[19:09] <rindolf> ZuluOne: did you contribute any code to open source projects?

[19:09] <rindolf> ZuluOne: oh nice.

[19:09] <rindolf> ZuluOne: POV-Ray is not exactly open-source from what I understand.

[19:09] <rindolf> ZuluOne: in ANSI C, right?

[19:09] <ZuluOne> not exactly

[19:09] <rindolf> ZuluOne: I see.

[19:09] <ZuluOne> They have made a vague attempt at converting to C++, but it is still full of Cisms.

[19:10] *** weinig|work joined
[19:10] <ZuluOne> The source is available, and you can make and distribute patches, but you can't redistribute modified versions.

[19:10] <rindolf> ZuluOne: I hate it when projects convert from C to C++.

[19:10] <rindolf> ZuluOne: unless it's C/C++.

[19:10] <rindolf> ZuluOne: it happened to BMPx now.

[19:10] <rindolf> I like ANSI C better than C++.

[19:11] <rindolf> ZuluOne: like qmail or something?

[19:11] <ZuluOne> I know nothing of qmail's license.

[19:11] <rindolf> ZuluOne: oh, it's horrible.

[19:11] <rindolf> ZuluOne: I'm stuck with qmail on iglu.org.il.

[19:11] <rindolf> I already converted all the mailing lists from ezmlm to Sympa.

[19:12] <rindolf> Sympa now takes 10% of the memory, though, but at least it's portable.

[19:12] <rindolf> I wrote some Perl scripts to do that.

[19:12] <rindolf> ZuluOne: see http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/qmail/

[19:12] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - out of curiosity, why the 20 questions with ZuluOne?

[19:12] <lambdabot> Title: "The Anti-qmail Page"

[19:13] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I'm bored.

[19:13] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: or at least in a talkative mood.

[19:13] <rindolf> ZuluOne: I hope I'm not disturbing you.

[19:13] <ZuluOne> not at all

[19:13] <ZuluOne> but I have to go out now

[19:13] <rindolf> I also know people dislike when other people tell too much about themselves.

[19:14] <rindolf> ZuluOne: OK, bye.

[19:14] <ZuluOne> back later

[19:14] <Limbic_Region> I was just wondering if you recognized the handle and were trying to determine if ZuluOne was someone specific

[19:14] <rindolf> ZuluOne: you shouldn't get life get in the way of IRC.
