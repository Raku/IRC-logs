[12:12] <nothingmuch> http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/traffic_lights.php

[12:12] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yy3plt

[12:12] <nothingmuch> wiki-style driving? ;-)

[12:14] <Juerd_> Bleh. That picture doesn't show Dutch traffic lights.

[12:17] <Juerd_> And I've never heard of any place called Drachen :)

[12:17] <Juerd_> Perhaps they meant Drachten.

[12:17] <Juerd_> But then, I can't imagine they'd do this in Drachten :)

[12:18] <Juerd_> (Population 45k, so that sort of matches the article)

[12:18] <Juerd_> (We don't call that a small city though :P)

[12:19] <dmq> ive heard about that program

[12:19] <dmq> its supposed to be quite successful.

[12:20] <dmq> apparently its resulted in quite a reduction in serious automobile/pedestrian accidents.

[12:21] <dmq> And it is Drachten.

[12:21] <Juerd_> Interesting

[12:22] <Juerd_> I'm going to Drachten to see family soon, I'll pay attention.

[12:22] <Juerd_> Can't find *anything* about this program with Google, though.

[12:22] *** elmex joined
[12:22] <Juerd_> Not in Google News, not in normal Google

[12:22] <Juerd_> Not in Wikipedia

[12:22] <dmq> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_space

[12:22] <dmq> You didnt look very hard.

[12:22] <dmq> I did in a few seconds. :-)

[12:23] <dmq> do a search for Drachten Traffic Calming

[12:23] <dmq> or Drachten Traffic reduction

[12:24] <Juerd_> I was looking specifically for Dutch pages.

[12:24] <Juerd_> Keywords "drachten" and "verkeerslichten" ("traffic lights")

[12:24] <dmq> heh. stands to reason. things like this are always better publicized outside of the country where it happens. :-)

[12:25] <dmq> Well, Drachten and that engineer Hans Monderman are fairly well known in the "reclaim the streets" communities.

[12:25] <Juerd_> By the way, replacing intersections with roundabouts is common in the whole of .nl

[12:25] <dmq> Ive seen him mentioned a number of times.

[12:25] <wolverian> they're doing the roundabout thing here too. supposedly has better throughput.

[12:25] <dmq> Yes, its cheaper with better throughput.

[12:25] <wolverian> (and cheaper to maintain.)

[12:26] <wolverian> right.

[12:26] <Juerd_> http://www.smallingerland.nl/index.cfm?sid=175  # The images of the Laweiplein are typical, and not very Drachten-specific :)

[12:26] <lambdabot> Title: English / Traffic solutions, http://tinyurl.com/yaft5k

[12:26] <Juerd_> dmq: It only has better throughput up to a certain amount of traffic.

[12:26] <Juerd_> After that, traffic lights become better again

[12:26] <Juerd_> But I don't think you'd have those intensities in Drachten :)

[12:27] <Juerd_> We have this huge roundabout in a motorway. (Well, because it's a roundabout, that part isn't officially part of the motorway). That *doesn't* work.

[12:27] <dmq> i cant comment on that part. as a cyclist im not so fond of roudabouts.

[12:27] <Juerd_> Why not?

[12:27] <Juerd_> On most Dutch roundabouts, cyclists get precedence.

[12:27] <dmq> compared to signaled junctions they are much less safe.

[12:28] <dmq> yes, in holland im sure they do. in england however...

[12:28] <dmq> my god.

[12:28] <dmq> some of those roudabouts scared the willies out of me.

[12:28] <Juerd_> Do they have coloured bicycle lanes?

[12:28] <dmq> Old street roundabout in particular.

[12:28] <dmq> hmm, i guess sometimes.

[12:29] <dmq> but the problem is that even with a bicycle lane you have to pass a lot of access points where visibility is an issue.

[12:29] <dmq> people turning and looking over their shoulder dont see you in the corner of their eye.

[12:29] *** rodi joined
[12:29] <Juerd_> Oh. That's nasty.

[12:29] <dmq> whereas with a signaled junction you go IN FRONT of the cars and let them wait. It might annoy them, but its MUCH safer.

[12:30] <Juerd_> The thing that scared me most, repeatedly, when I was in the UK as a pedestrian, was that people keep driving on the wrong side :)

[12:30] *** miyagawa_ joined
[12:30] <dmq> yeah, in the cities they have notices on the pavement saying "look right" or "look left" as is appropriate.

[12:30] <Juerd_> Even after two days, I still wasn't used to looking to the right first.

[12:31] <dmq> I have to say that I view this one maybe a little differently than others, my view is you should never assume that you only need to check one way.

[12:31] <Juerd_> It's a habit...

[12:31] <dmq> your momma taught you to check both ways before crossing for a reason. :-)

[12:31] <Juerd_> A bad one indeed.

[12:32] <dmq> yes, vehicles dont always follow the rules and you cant assume they will. For instance brakes fail, vehicles roll down hills, people back up, or get confused. etc.

[12:32] <dmq> Im kinda hard ass on that point becuase i was a cycle messenger for a few years.

[12:32] <dmq> And i saw a lot of people get nailed by stuff like that.

[12:32] <Juerd_> Hm. where do cyclists go on English roundabouts?

[12:33] <dmq> what do you mean?

[12:33] <dmq> normally the only place you can safely stay is on the outside.

[12:33] <Juerd_> Well, we drive on the right side, so cyclists are the most right. In roundabouts, that means they're on the outside.

[12:33] <Juerd_> Hm, that's the same over there of course.

[12:33] <dmq> same thing, just the directions are reversed iirc.

[12:33] <Juerd_> Nevermind, I wasn't thinking :)

[12:34] <Juerd_> Well, I was, but not very logically.

[12:34] <wolverian> heh, I didn't realise that either. dammit.

[12:34] <dmq> I saw three people get killed while i was courier in london.

[12:34] <Juerd_> Hm

[12:34] <dmq> all three were for not looking.

[12:34] <Juerd_> We have three kinds of roundabouts here, in terms of how cyclists are treated.

[12:35] <dmq> two north americans who stepped into "empty" roads because they looked the wrong way, and 1 pedestrian who assumed that just becuase the cars couldnt move that cyclists or motorcycles couldnt be moving in between them.

[12:35] <Juerd_> 1. bicycles go with normal traffic, on the roundabout itself. They get precedence.

[12:36] <dmq> in my experience comparing bicycle interactions in holland with anywhere else is a mistake. its totally unlike anywhere else ive been anyway.

[12:36] <Juerd_> 2. separated bicycle paths, that have normal intersections around the roundabout. Cyclists get right of way

[12:36] <Juerd_> 3. Same as 2, but they don't.

[12:37] <dmq> i mean even mentioning bicycles getting precedence is unlike pretty much anywhere else.

[12:37] <Juerd_> No, comparing is a good thing. Eventually, someone might learn something from it.

[12:37] <wolverian> there aren't enough bicyclers here.

[12:37] <Juerd_> If bicycles don't get precedence, they should have separated paths, that aren't part of the roundabout.

[12:37] <dmq> I almost fell off my bike the first time i was in holland. I crossed the german border and this huge articulated bus STOPPED FOR ME. I was shocked.

[12:38] <Juerd_> Haha

[12:38] <Juerd_> I've forced them to.

[12:38] <dmq> Like a hundred people waited for me to haul my sorry butt and bicycle out of the way. And im standing there looking at the bus thinking WTF are you doing, get on with it so i can go.

[12:38] <Juerd_> One time, a bus wasn't going to give me my precedence.

[12:38] <Juerd_> So I parked by bicycle right in front of him, and walked to the driver.

[12:39] <Juerd_> And asked why. He said he couldn't see me. He was right.

[12:39] <Juerd_> I mailed the local govenment, and they changed the situation within a year.

[12:39] <dmq> what was the deal? the road layout?

[12:39] <Juerd_> Yes.

[12:39] <wolverian> Juerd_, very nice.

[12:39] <dmq> Thats cool.

[12:39] <Juerd_> wolverian: I thought so

[12:40] <dmq> In London the busses aim at you generally.

[12:40] <wolverian> a year is very very fast.

[12:40] <Juerd_> A lot of people had complained about this specific spot.

[12:40] <Juerd_> But nobody suggested improvement.

[12:40] <Juerd_> They only changed one tiny thing: there now is a second bicycle lane, in the middle of the road, for people who don't go to the right.

[12:41] <dmq> See thats totally unlike how most places i can think of work.

[12:41] <Juerd_> But such coloured strips on the road are indications for drivers that they should pay extra attention. They get a warning before reaching the point where they can no longer see you.

[12:41] <dmq> Ive seen them pull out cycle lanes because the stores next to it complain that nobody can park.

[12:41] <Juerd_> dmq: :(

[12:42] <dmq> im serious. for a cyclist holland is like the garden of eden.

[12:42] <Juerd_> Hm, really

[12:42] <Juerd_> I think we could do much better.

[12:42] <dmq> i was there a while ago in a hotel that overlooked a fairly intense intersection and i was marveling at how well engineered the path was

[12:42] <dmq> the cycle path i mean.

[12:43] <dmq> it was angled so people coming off the road at a reasonable clip would be able to take the turn without hassle.

[12:43] <Juerd_> That's supposed to be common sense

[12:43] <dmq> it wasnt like a straight 90 degree turn.

[12:43] <dmq> I mean, I watched some people take the turn at a pretty good speed and then just leaned over and held their course.

[12:44] <dmq> in Toronto it would have been a straight 90 degree turn with no clearance.

[12:44] <Juerd_> Straight 90 degrees anything is uncommon in traffic here, these decades. They've removed houses to make wider turns possible.

[12:44] <dmq> IE, engineered for movign at like 3 klicks or something.

[12:45] <dmq> being able to take turns like that in traffic was what seperated the couriers from the pedestrian cyclists. :-)

[12:45] <dmq> All i know is i marvel every time i go to Holland.

[12:45] <Juerd_> I live near a dangerous complicated intersection of 5 roads. But indeed foreigners have said it was great...

[12:45] <dmq> What  a fantastic place. :-)

[12:46] <Juerd_> It should be a big roundabout, IMO, but they can't do that because it's the main route for the fire department.

[12:46] <dmq> I guess everything is relative, but yeah, for somebody like me riding a bike in holland (even germany) is totally different to the UK or Canada.

[12:47] <dmq> and those little 125 cc motor bikes --  you can ride them on the cycle lanes in holland right?

[12:48] <Juerd_> You need what's called a "certificate"

[12:48] <Juerd_> Which is a license.

[12:48] <dmq> but not hard to get i surmise from the quotes?

[12:48] <wolverian> Juerd_, the intersections like that here are insane, but perhaps I can't make out the detail well enough to see if they're really similar.

[12:48] <Juerd_> Though the general rule is that motorized bikes have to join normal traffic, unless there's a specific local sign saying otherwise.

[12:48] <dmq> let me see if i can find a map of the hairyiest intersection i can remember.

[12:49] <Juerd_> It's incredibly not-hard-to-get.

[12:49] <Juerd_> But the dumbest people still fail...

[12:58] <wolverian> roundabouts for goats :)

[12:59] <Juerd_> The Hyde Park Corner one is a bit dark on the air photos

[13:00] <Juerd_> Re Old Street... A square roundabout. What were they thinking?

[13:00] <Juerd_> "Cool, now we can have 4 straight corners, just like before"

[13:00] <Juerd_> This way you get four complicated intersections instead of just one

[13:01] <dmq> th thing the map doesnt show is how important that intersection is.

[13:01] <dmq> its a major road.

[13:01] <dmq> like 6 lanes or so coming into the intersection from the north

[13:02] <dmq> then picadilly is 4 lanes, etc etc.

[13:02] <Juerd_> http://maps.google.nl/maps?f=q&hl=nl&q=Old+street,+London&ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=51.525881,-0.087601&spn=0.002944,0.010815&t=k&om=1

[13:02] <Juerd_> You can see it on that one

[13:03] <dmq> yeah, if you do zoom 0 you can see it well.

[13:03] <Juerd_> Oh, wow, that's high resolution

[13:03] <dmq> thats another high traffic intersection.

[13:03] <Juerd_> I'm used to 2 being the best you can get from Google Maps, so I don't even try more.

[13:04] <Juerd_> Multi lane roundabouts suck, unless they're "turbo roundabouts".

[13:04] <Juerd_> Do you have those? :)

[13:04] <Juerd_> (turborotonde)

[13:04] <dmq> the street going south is the main road into the square mile from the north. so it has a lot of traffic.

[13:05] *** Psyche^ joined
[13:05] <Juerd_> http://i1.tinypic.com/xm8k1w.jpg

[13:05] <Juerd_> A turboroundabout is the only kind of multi lane roundabout that works.

[13:05] <Juerd_> All others are better replaced with traffic lights.

[13:06] * dmq nods

[13:06] <dmq> that looks like it might be reasonable sane on a bicycle.

[13:06] <Juerd_> Oh, NO!

[13:06] <Juerd_> No way.

[13:06] <Juerd_> Turboroundabouts are NEVER allowed for cyclists, as far as I've seen.

[13:06] <Juerd_> These are always of the kind where bicycle paths are around the roundabout.

[13:07] <Juerd_> The "turbo" thing also relates to speed.

[13:13] <dmq> oh ok

[13:13] <Juerd_> That's typical in populated areas

[13:13] <Juerd_> Bicycle intensity is high enough to warrant dedicated paths

[13:13] <Juerd_> That go outside the roundabout.

[13:14] <Juerd_> This one is big, so the cyclists get to go clockwise if they choose. That would never be possible on a roundabout :)

[16:38] <thepler> is there a way to get all the objects of a class currently in memory?  like maybe Foo.HOW.all_objects

[16:39] <nothingmuch> thepler: not as specced

[16:39] <nothingmuch> but if you write a meta class that does object tracking there's no reason why not

[16:40] <thepler> will that not be available from the default meta class?

[16:40] <nothingmuch> it's expensive and not very useful

[16:40] <nothingmuch> i mean, you don't really want a 20x size overhead to track Ints, do you ;-)

[16:41] <thepler> it would let one look at all classes as relations (ie SQL tables)

[16:41] <thepler> yes, it would take more memory

[16:48] <nothingmuch> in theory:

[16:48] <nothingmuch> subclass the metaclass

[16:48] <nothingmuch> override the low level constructor

[16:48] <nothingmuch> to also register instances

[16:48] <nothingmuch> ditto for the low level destructor

[16:48] <nothingmuch> and blammo, you're done

[16:48] <thepler> yes.

[16:48] <nothingmuch> you should even be able to do class MyLovely meta Meta::Class but Meta::ObjectAccounting { }

[16:48] <thepler> i suppose the case for Ints is overkill

[16:49] <thepler> but maybe a debugger might want to see all the Ints

[16:50] <thepler> i was assuming that the default metaclass might already be tracking all it's objects

[17:00] <nothingmuch> then the debugger can hijack themetaclass,i guess

[17:00] <nothingmuch> remember that perl is dynamic at heart

[17:00] <nothingmuch> you can  hack that stuff in

[17:45] *** hexmode joined
[17:45] *** spoop joined
[17:45] <nothingmuch> not necessarily

[17:46] <pmurias> never code or examined a gc myself so it was only a wild guess..

[17:47] <pmurias> nothingmuch: how?

[17:47] <pmurias> s/how?/why?/

[17:47] <nothingmuch> one sec

[17:47] <nothingmuch> phone

[17:47] <pmurias> fine

[17:48] <awwaiid> well gc's do reference counting, usually. The only reason to actually walk all objects is to do a mark-and-sweep, killing things which are not referenced by the main group

[17:49] *** Limbic_Region joined
[17:49] <awwaiid> many GCs are generational, such that they do reference counting (when an obj ref -> 0, kill it) and then they do a mark-and-sweep occasionally ... they do it in a such a way that long-lived objects are put into a group and are mark-and-swept less frequently (because the odds of them going away is smaller)

[17:49] <awwaiid> tons and tons of literature on the topic abounds elsewhere

[17:49] <nothingmuch> back

[17:49] <nothingmuch> one example

[17:50] <nothingmuch> sub foo { my $obj = Foo->new; blah blah blah; } $obj never escapes

[17:50] <nothingmuch> a compiler could optimize $obj to live on the stack only

[17:50] <nothingmuch> so that it never needs garbage collection

[17:50] <awwaiid> nice

[17:51] <nothingmuch> awwaiid: ocaml does that extensively =)

[17:51] <pmurias> awwaid: was looking at wikipedia when you answered me :)

[17:51] <awwaiid> makes sense

[17:51] <nothingmuch> my point is, the compiler should strive for a situation where it doesn't need to keep track of every object

[17:51] <nothingmuch> since that's expensive, and Perl 6 uses autoboxing so that every value is potentially an object in some contexts

[17:52] <pmurias> nothingmuch: can't the blah blah blah save $obj?

[17:52] <nothingmuch> if it does save it the compiler can't make that optimization

[17:52] <awwaiid> the compiler has to prove to itself that it doesn't

[17:52] <nothingmuch> however, if the compiler can prove that it doesn't escape

[17:52] <nothingmuch> it doesn't have to codegen a GC registration on the allocation of $obj

[17:52] <pmurias> i understand

[17:53] <nothingmuch> or a GC sweep at the scope exit if all the objects in that scope can be proven as such

[17:53] <nothingmuch> since perl 6 doesn't spec a GC api that lets you enumerate all objects

[17:53] <nothingmuch> one must assume that list will probably be partial if it is at all exposed

[17:53] <nothingmuch> dinnertime

[17:53] <nothingmuch> see you =)

[17:53] <pmurias> see you :)

[17:54] <awwaiid> bye!

[18:16] <Limbic_Region> anyone aware of recent build failures?

[18:16] * Limbic_Region just did a realclean just in case

[18:29] <Limbic_Region> does Pugs.Internals.ID need to go into Pugs.cabal?

[18:37] <Limbic_Region> well, adding Pugs.Internals.ID to Pugs.cabal.in certainly changes the output but it is still b0rk

[18:38] <Limbic_Region> @tell audreyt Win32 build failure due to Pugs.Internals.ID http://sial.org/pbot/21082 I guessed that it had something to do with Pugs.cabal.in but just adding it as an exposed module didn't fix the problem (though it died for a different reason)

[20:32] <Limbic_Region> I will nopaste

[20:45] <Limbic_Region> I bomb at 2 of 97

[20:46] <cmarcelo> hmm, right.. I passed that :P

[20:46] <cmarcelo> but with prev rev you passed 2/97 also, dont you?

[20:46] <Limbic_Region> no - bombs at the same place

[20:47] <Limbic_Region> oh - you mean prior to your last rev - yes

[20:47] <Limbic_Region> I get beyond 97 of 97 before the bomb

[20:48] <Limbic_Region> trying something now

[20:48] <cmarcelo> that's strange.. I've just included new modules in this rev.. mind checking if prev revision passes 2/97?

[20:48] <Limbic_Region> cmarcelo - just rm'd Pugs.cabal.in and svn up'd

[20:48] <Limbic_Region> will try that suggestion in a sec

[20:48] <Limbic_Region> first - would you mind nopasting your working Pugs.cabal.in?

[21:00] <cmarcelo> what was wrong? you had local changes on cabal.in ?

[21:01] <Limbic_Region> right - I had tried to add the ID to exposed modules and then to other modules playing around

[21:01] <Limbic_Region> I thought I had properly removed them but obviously svn choked on the svn up

[21:01] * Limbic_Region is just happy that his hunch about the problem was in the right neighborhood

[21:04] <cmarcelo> :)

[21:05] <cmarcelo> dear perl6 folks: which Syn contain information regarding Feeds, and it's relation with Captures? can captures hold more than one feed? does this question even make sense?

[21:07] <nothingmuch> cmarcelo: http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/MO/t/native_p5.t

[21:07] <nothingmuch> =)

[21:07] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/ygur42

[21:10] <Limbic_Region> cmarcelo - the feed operator can be found is S03

[21:10] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: Class::Inspector is a Perl 5 standard OO module?

[21:11] <Limbic_Region> cmarcelo - actually, S06 has a section on Feed operators too - so S03 and S06

[21:12] <nothingmuch> no

[21:13] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: sorry, by standard I meant, it works with other OO "class creators" too? (think Moose or some Class::...)

[21:13] <nothingmuch> oh

[21:13] <cmarcelo> Limbic_Region: I'll check them out, tks..

[21:13] <nothingmuch> it works with plain old 'package Foo; sub moose { }'

[21:13] <Limbic_Region> cmarcelo - anytime you are wondering such things

[21:13] <Limbic_Region> cd docs/Perl6/Spec

[21:13] <Limbic_Region> grep -l <keyword> *.pod

[21:15] *** justatheory joined
[21:16] <cmarcelo> documents on Spec/ are sync'ed with the perl.org Synopsis repo?

[21:16] <Limbic_Region> cmarcelo - have you ever watched when you svn up

[21:16] <Limbic_Region> it syncs them as part of that process

[21:16] <Limbic_Region> or perhaps Makefile.PL or make

[21:16] <Limbic_Region> somewhere along the way they are sync'd

[21:18] <cmarcelo> right. what I didn't knew is that it renamed the files...

[21:19] <nothingmuch> moooseness!

[21:19] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: hmmm, lots of new perl things to learn in recent MO commits..

[21:19] <nothingmuch> cmarcelo: please disregard the yucky impl of MO::Emit::P5

[21:20] <nothingmuch> it's implemented kind of slopily

[21:20] <nothingmuch> what new things?

[21:20] <cmarcelo> hehe. I was reading that file..

[21:20] <nothingmuch> it needs to be refactored a bit

[21:20] <cmarcelo> *{"${package}::${method}"} = $hash->{$method};

[21:20] <nothingmuch> and it needs a wrapper API

[21:21] <nothingmuch> ah, that's just a symbol table assignment

[21:21] <cmarcelo> *{} syntax is new to me.. typeglob stuff, no?

[21:21] <nothingmuch> yep

[21:21] <Limbic_Region> with sym refs no less

[21:21] <Limbic_Region> one of the few places sym refs are a good thing

[21:24] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: what's this new stack thing?

[21:25] <nothingmuch> cmarcelo: pugs has that in the eval monad

[21:25] <nothingmuch> i need caller for ByCaller multiplexing

[21:25] <nothingmuch> and putting it in Invocation was ugly

[21:29] <nothingmuch> see also MO::Run::Aux

[21:29] <nothingmuch> the way it maps between responder interfaces and packages

[21:31] <nothingmuch> @tell audreyt MO::Emit::P5 is ugly, but it works ;-) http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/MO/t/native_p5.t

[21:41] <cmarcelo> nothingmuch: RI::Multiplexed::ByCaller allows to have different responder interfaces for different callers.. you use this to deal with something else than private methods/attrs? or I got it wrong?
