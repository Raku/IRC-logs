[01:19] <audreyt> I'll stay in conference hotel

[06:47] <Eidolos> audreyt: I'm reading through your recent Pugs slides. Very nice work. :)

[06:54] <eviltwin_b> so if I have implemented a new operator (which the parser already knows about), jhow do I hook it in?

[06:55] <eviltwin_b> I thought just adding the appropriate `op1 ...' foo (in this case `op1 "-M"') would do it due to pattern matching, but pugs complains about prefix:-M not being defined

[07:03] <eviltwin_b> hm, ok, so that error implies it found it but thought it mismatched in types.  think I'm too tired to untangle tis now

[07:03] <eviltwin_b> Haskell types are (obviously) correct, not sure how the internal Perl types work although I cloned the file size stuff to set it up

[07:05] <lumi> eviltwin_b: I think it needs to be added to the prec table?

[07:10] <eviltwin_b> hm, looked to me like all the file tests werer already there, just without implementations

[07:10] <eviltwin_b> (but with tests, somewhat incorrectly)

[07:10] <lumi> Which I think is initSyms in Pugs.Prims

[07:10] <lumi> See, the other -X are in there

[07:12] <eviltwin_b> ah, yes, missed that somehow.  rebuilding now.  lumi++

[07:12] * eviltwin_b should probably not have bitten off quite so much the first time :)

[07:13] <lumi> Nonsense, always leap before you think

[07:18] <eviltwin_b> huh, didn't realize perl5 returned fractional days.  okay, get to tweak a bit

[07:18] <eviltwin_b> otherwise, I appear to have success :)

[07:22] *** palomer joined
[07:22] <palomer> will I have to put @ before hash tables in perl 6?

[07:36] <Eidolos> The grades test case (in junctions) is kind of weird. if (one(@grade) < $threshold) { you may go to the movies } else { you may not }

[07:36] <Eidolos> But if all your @grades are above threshold, you still may not go to the movies.

[07:37] <Eidolos> It should probably use all(@grade) >= $threshold

[07:38] <Eidolos> (but then it might just be a test for one in which case the odd output is probably excusable)

[07:42] <Eidolos> Er, it's not a test case, sorry, it's an example.

[07:43] <eviltwin_b> palomer: a hash variable would always be prefixed by % --- you never use @ (like in perl5 for hash slices) or $ (for individual lookups)

[07:45] <eviltwin_b> woo.

[07:46] <eviltwin_b> only problem with this code (aside from someone probably disliking the style :) is silliness with EpochTime

[07:46] <eviltwin_b> afaict the only way to get it into a useful numeric form is read $ show

[08:00] *** nusgnaf joined
[08:13] *** DHGE joined
[08:16] <eviltwin_b> hmph.  think I confused svn somehow; svn diff (empty) and svn status (various generated files) don't do useful things

[08:18] <Eidolos> svn status is probably reporting mysteriously new files, and svn diff isn't showing them because they aren't svn added.

[08:18] <eviltwin_b> er?  the created files are things like Makefiles

[08:18] <eviltwin_b> I added no files otherwise

[08:18] <Eidolos> What does svn status look like?

[08:18] <eviltwin_b> but I'd expect to see the changes I made to e.g. src/Pugs/Prim.hs

[08:18] <Eidolos> oh

[15:07] <integral> you haven't installed enough GHC

[15:07] <integral> did you install from source?

[15:08] <integral> If you installed from source, you need to follow what the last paragraph of the error says: you need both -src and -src-extralibs (untar them both from the same dir, they both untar into the ghc-6.6 subdirectory)

[15:11] <rindolf> integral: I compiled the ghc-6.6 SRPM that I adapted myself.

[15:11] <rindolf> integral: I didn't unpack src-extralibs.

[15:11] <integral> That's the problem then.

[15:11] <rindolf> integral: so I'm going to do that.

[15:11] <integral> If you understand how to build cabal modules indidually, you could build extralibs as its own srpm(s)

[16:54] <Debolaz> Can perl 5 modules be used for inheritance, or are you merely able to 'use' them?

[16:58] <audreyt> Debolaz: they are not yet integrated into the metaobject model

[16:58] <audreyt> so currently no, but I'll keep that req in mind this weekend working with cmarcelo on MOH

[16:58] <audreyt> there's nothing preventing them from being inherited, it's just SMOP :)
