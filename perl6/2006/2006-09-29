[00:40] <audreyt> [particle]: hey, I made you metacommitter

[00:41] <[particle]> audreyt, thanks, what does that mean?

[00:41] <audreyt> meaning you can freely hand out committer bit the next time someone asks :)

[00:41] <audreyt> most people regularly appearing here in #perl6 has metacommit bit

[00:41] <[particle]> excellent, now i need to figure out how...

[00:42] <audreyt> a sec

[00:43] <audreyt> login to rt.openfoundry.org first and then http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Admin/Members/index.html?Queue=270

[00:43] <lambdabot> Title: Pugs -- OSSF, http://tinyurl.com/fc5ql

[00:43] <audreyt> which I've just added a DNS alias to http://commitbit.pugscode.org/ (takes a while to propagate)

[00:46] <[particle]> del.icio.us, thanks!

[00:46] <audreyt> cool!

[00:47] <[particle]> so, i've got ~5000 static html pages, and i'm looking for a search tool. any leads?

[00:47] <audreyt> uhm, htdig?

[00:48] <[particle]> yeah, that's the first thing i thought of. you seem to know of everything bleeding edge, so i figured i'd ask ;)

[00:49] <TreyHarris> audreyt: i'd be happy to help with that as well... i was here too when yts asked

[00:50] <audreyt> TreyHarris: done

[00:50] <TreyHarris> thanks :)

[00:51] <audreyt> :)

[00:53] <zptao> grep

[00:54] <zptao> or write a script for it

[01:03] <ajs_home> I gave up. These days I use MediaWiki, which has decent (but not great) search built in.... I'm thinking of applying Perl 6 to improving its search as an early project once pugs is stable....

[01:06] <audreyt> pugs is by definition no more stable than the perl6 specs, though... :)

[01:10] *** aufrank joined
[01:12] <[particle]> pugs is stable, if you don't C<svn up> ;)

[01:13] <audreyt> [particle]++ # jhi will approve of this definition

[01:23] *** Aankhen`` joined
[01:26] <audreyt> TreyHarris: the "your" declarator is already in perl5

[01:26] <audreyt> via Acme::Your on CPAN

[01:36] <svnbot6> r13717 | audreyt++ | * Prefix +^ now takes arbitrary-precision integers; it's simply:

[01:36] <svnbot6> r13717 | audreyt++ |     sub (Int $x) { -$x - 1 }

[01:37] <[particle]> a 2's compliment op?

[01:38] <TimToady> yes

[01:40] <[particle]> hrmm, S03 says 1's compliment ...checking which is correct...

[01:40] *** kanru joined
[01:41] <TimToady> they're both correct

[01:41] <TimToady> 2's complement merely changes the numeric meaning of flipping all the bits.

[01:42] <[particle]> okay, so this is pure bit twiddling, it's not really -$x - 1

[01:42] <TimToady> it's assuming we're using arbitrarily large integers to store bits as 2's complement

[01:43] <[particle]> ok. but the true internal representation is ieee, at least for parrot (i think that's specced, too)

[01:43] <audreyt> perl6's Int is not parrot's I32...

[01:44] <[particle]> (and ieee is sign-magnitude)

[01:44] <TimToady> it doesn't actually have to keep track of all the bits, since there are an infinite number of either 1 or 0 bits there.

[01:44] <[particle]> audreyt, yes i know.

[01:44] <[particle]> does this extend to int, or just Int?

[01:44] <audreyt> +^ on int probably flips bits using native repr

[01:44] <[particle]> ok, great.

[01:44] <audreyt> however, undecorated numeric literals assume Int

[01:45] <audreyt> not int, behaviour

[01:45] <audreyt> so +^0 is always -1, I think

[01:45] <[particle]> yes, that's sane.

[01:45] <[particle]> unless pragmata apply

[01:45] <TimToady> we'd like to think so o_O

[01:45] <[particle]> ack *thppt*

[01:45] <audreyt> TimToady: S03:926 is misleading, then, as it talks about machine dependent behaviour

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ | * Make interpolating <<$x>> behave a bit more like <<literal>>:

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ |     my $x = 'foo';

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ |     << $x >>;       # Str('foo')

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ |     << $x $x >>;    # Seq(Str('foo'), Str('foo'))

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ |   It used to be that it produces a list no matter what, but that

[01:48] <svnbot6> r13718 | audreyt++ |   wasn't the behaviour for noninterpolating literals.

[01:49] *** MacVince joined
[01:53] <audreyt> TimToady: should +^1.5 coerce, or use native Num flipbit?

[01:56] <TimToady> Wouldn't the standard implicit semantics coerce unless Num defines flipbit?

[01:58] <audreyt> sure, but the opcode is spelled +^ not int^

[01:58] <audreyt> but otoh, bitwise on floating is something perl5 didn't do

[01:59] <audreyt> maybe surprising if it starts doing that by default

[01:59] <TimToady> but if there's prefix:<+^>:(Int) and not :(Num)...

[01:59] <audreyt> nodnod.

[01:59] <audreyt> ok, as-is then

[02:00] <TimToady> I think it works out in floating anyway: int(-1.5 - 1) - 1 == 1

[02:01] <audreyt> good (floating) point

[02:02] <TimToady> real-ly

[02:03] * audreyt triages on

[02:03] *** weinigBBL is now known as weinigZzZ

[02:03] <TimToady> how difficult will it be to rewrite @.foo() to @(self.foo()) or self.foo().[]

[02:04] <TimToady> lots of the ext tests you're working your way toward fail on that...

[02:05] <audreyt> hmmm

[02:05] <TimToady> (on account o', that's what I translated ./foo() to.)

[02:05] <TimToady> well, sometimes.

[02:05] <TimToady> hard part is picking up the .()

[02:05] <audreyt> yeah. need case analysis

[02:06] <audreyt> seen @.foo, don't parse it as Var, instead parse it as call

[02:06] <jabbot> audreyt: I havn't seen @.foo,, audreyt

[02:06] <audreyt> but "has @.foo()" invalid

[02:06] <audreyt> right?

[02:06] <audreyt> so this only makes sense in expr

[02:06] <audreyt> not sig position

[02:06] <TimToady> yeah, unless we want @.foo to have a sig for some reason.  :/

[02:07] <TimToady> actually, didn't S09 allow sigs on arrays and hashes?  Lemme check...

[02:08] <TimToady> yeah, it does currently.

[02:09] <audreyt> hrmph.

[02:10] <audreyt> what about

[02:10] <audreyt> @::('.foo')

[02:10] <audreyt> ?

[02:10] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[02:10] <audreyt> is that even legal?

[02:11] <TimToady> It could probably be made legal, but I'd have to see a decent use case for separate a twigil from its sigil.

[02:12] <audreyt> ok, not considering it then

[02:12] <theorbtwo> @.::('foo') is legal, though?

[02:12] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[02:12] <TimToady> in fact, one could argue that the reason for separating them is to denature the twigil.

[02:13] <audreyt> TimToady: what's

[02:13] <TimToady> much like $object.'*foo' calls the *foo method

[02:13] <audreyt> $.foo.(1)

[02:13] <audreyt> ?

[02:13] <audreyt> it's the same as $.foo(1) ?

[02:14] <TimToady> I think .() and () are always the same as postfix.

[02:14] <audreyt> okie.

[02:14] <zptao> did they cut your balls off audreyt?

[02:15] <zptao> or do you just tuck it

[02:15] <audreyt> TimToady: also, I wonder if @.+foo should be made legal

[02:15] <audreyt> probably not.

[02:15] <audreyt> (quantified call)

[02:15] * theorbtwo gets "I My Me Strawbery Eggs" flashbacks.

[02:16] <TimToady> we can always add it later if it makes sense.

[02:16] <audreyt> @.foo: 1,2,3

[02:16] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[02:16] <audreyt> sane?

[02:17] <TimToady> I think it should be equiv to @.foo(1,2,3)

[02:18] <TimToady> it really is a method call underneath, after all.

[02:18] <TimToady> self.foo(1,2,3).[]

[02:18] <TimToady> it's just an attribute with a fancier name.

[02:19] <ajs_home> I have a question about my recent RFC on p6l if anyone has a second. It was supposed to be a quick thing, but at this point, I'm not sure. Is it worth pursuing, or should I just drop it?

[02:20] <ajs_home> Hmm... I'm sensing "just drop it."

[02:21] <TimToady> I think it's just something to bear in mind as we go along.

[02:21] <TimToady> We're all feeling our way into the roles thing, and how it relates to scopes.

[02:22] <TimToady> my original proto notion was really directed more at lexical scopes, but if it can be extended to class scopes, that seems like a cool idea.

[02:23] <ajs_home> Fair enough. I was just getting antsy, seeing all of the places that the same multi method would be exported from each class... with the hope that they would all play nicely, but I have to admit that my idea was just a stop-gap, and not a full solution

[02:23] <ajs_home> I'll let it go for now.

[02:23] <ajs_home> Thanks

[02:23] <TimToady> at the moment, I think the overall sentiment is that we mostly just want to get the thing out the door without boxing ourselves in

[02:23] <ajs_home> Out the door sounds like a nice plan

[02:23] <TimToady> but there's plenty of wiggle room left

[02:23] <TimToady> (fingers crossed)

[02:33] <mugwump> audreyt: do you know of any words with «ö (or other tonal √º) in the Hanyu Pinyin?

[02:34] <audreyt> the umlaut U

[02:34] <mugwump> or anyone with some zh knowledge?  :)

[02:34] <audreyt> is used not as a tone

[02:34] <audreyt> but as alternate spelling of yu

[02:35] <mugwump> oh, so it's not a distinct vowel?

[02:35] <mugwump> so, H√†ny«ö would be correct?

[02:35] <audreyt> as in nyu (woman), lyu (travel)

[02:36] <audreyt> actually "yu" doesn't need the umlaut

[02:36] <audreyt> it's only needed after n/y

[06:30] <agentzh> gaal: yeah, you're absolutely right!

[06:30] <agentzh> maybe something like "do the same thing everywhere"

[06:31] <TreyHarris> that's not consistency, that's obliviousness :)

[06:34] <gaal> nope

[06:42] <TreyHarris> oh, this is just awful.  a project at $job requires me to pull two SNMP tables rooted at different points in the tree.  both tables are indexed to a third.  but that table--all three actually--keeps changing (it is maintained in alphabetical order and has items added/removed regularly).  so at no point in time can i be sure that the first table's nth item matches the other two's nth items. :-/

[06:47] <agentzh> gaal: i've updated the slides according to your suggestion. (see slide 16 and 17) thanks!

[06:47] <gaal> whee

[06:55] <agentzh> gaal: how about this name: http://perlcabal.org/agent/slides/naming/gaal.xul ?

[06:55] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/hh8do

[06:55] <TreyHarris> heh, i'm beginning to think that yts is just going to join, ask for a commit bit and leave, twice a day from now on :)

[06:56] <agentzh> the first glyph has similar pronunciation as gaal

[06:56] <agentzh> gaal: while the last two means "making waves" in chinese.

[06:56] <gaal> hee :)

[06:56] <audreyt> actually, "rabble rouser".

[06:56] <gaal> what's the pinyin for it?

[06:56] <agentzh> audreyt: sort of. :)

[06:57] <audreyt> ge3 xing1-lang4

[06:57] <agentzh> ge xing lang

[06:57] <audreyt> where xing1-lang4 is short for xing1-feng1-zuo4-lang4, "rabble rousing"

[06:57] *** ruz joined
[06:57] <agentzh> audreyt: lol

[06:57] <gaal> recursive definition? wow

[06:59] <agentzh> i was just about to say "gaal, let's see what audreyt would say on it"

[06:59] <agentzh> too sad "xing lang" has that meaning...

[06:59] <agentzh> chinese is a scary language, like perl. :)

[07:00] <agentzh> i has thought about "da4 lang4", "jing1 lang4"...

[07:00] <TreyHarris> is jonathan lang on this channel?

[07:01] <TreyHarris> speaking of langs :)

[07:01] <agentzh> maybe "jing1 lang4" is better?

[07:01] <gaal> yes, maybe I shouldn't take a name I can't pronounce

[07:01] <agentzh> fixing...

[07:02] <TreyHarris> how can i change some utf8 text into a string of \x... literals?

[07:03] <gaal> (the third tone is tricky for uneducated folks like myself)

[07:03] <audreyt> I think xing lang is fine

[07:03] <audreyt> rabble rousing is a good thing :)

[07:03] <agentzh> audreyt: yes?

[07:04] <agentzh> audreyt: glad you think in the same way as me. :)

[07:04] <gaal> "svn"

[07:04] <agentzh> maybe we should just the chinese family name for gaal?

[07:05] <agentzh> gaal has difficulty pronouncing ge3

[07:05] <agentzh> maybe we should simply get rid of the family name entirely?

[07:05] <gaal> maybe with some coaching. heh, february's approaching

[07:05] <agentzh> xing1 lang4 is good enough.

[07:06] <agentzh> xing1 lang4 reminds me of http://www.sina.com.cn ...

[07:06] <lambdabot> Title: –¬¿À ◊“≥

[07:07] <audreyt> I like ge3. gao1 can work (as in clkao), but gao1xing1 is a phrase and unsuitable here

[07:07] <audreyt> heh, that's xin1 lang4

[07:07] <TreyHarris> audreyt: is jonathan lang correct?  only roles may be abstract, not classes or packages (i think he means modules)?

[07:07] <audreyt> not xing1 lang4

[07:07] <audreyt> abstract, as in parameteric?

[07:08] <audreyt> class Foo[::t] ?

[07:08] <TreyHarris> audreyt: no, as in uninstantiable, meant only for is-ing

[07:08] <ajs_home> I would read that as "abstract is in class A {...}" which I think A12 said was legal.

[07:08] <audreyt> oh. you can instantiate a role

[07:08] <audreyt> in which case it creates an anonclass that trivially does it

[07:08] <TreyHarris> *may* be... i'm talking about the contrapositive of that

[07:09] <audreyt> but if you say .WHAT, you don't get back the role

[07:09] <audreyt> I mean, .HOW

[07:09] <audreyt> that is, a .HOW metaobject is never a role

[07:09] <TreyHarris> can you create a class that is uninstantiable until it is subclassed and filled in?

[07:09] *** snowstalker joined
[07:09] <audreyt> well, you can always trap things in new/CREATE/BUILD

[07:09] <audreyt> but that'd be dynamic runtime checks

[07:10] <audreyt> I don't think there's a declarative way to do that

[07:10] <agentzh> audreyt: i have some difficulty to differentiate xing and xin due to my chinese dialect. ;)

[07:10] <TreyHarris> ok, like Perl 5

[07:11] <audreyt> agentzh: I think "gao1 lang4" is good enough

[07:11] <audreyt> literally, "high wave"

[07:11] <agentzh> yeah, concise too.

[07:11] <TreyHarris> i'm very fond of factoring out my common "private" code into abstract superclasses.  roles are wrong for that, because roles are about "public" behavior mostly

[07:11] <audreyt> that is not so

[07:12] <audreyt> TreyHarris: "our method !foo" in a role can mixin into classes

[07:12] <audreyt> that use it

[07:12] <audreyt> yet unconsumable by public

[07:13] <agentzh> gaal: http://perlcabal.org/agent/slides/naming/gaal.xul

[07:13] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/hh8do

[07:13] <TreyHarris> audreyt: yes.  but would a role's BUILD be visited at a doer's instantiation time?

[07:13] <agentzh> gaal: that is gao1 lang4

[07:14] <gaal> heh, except i'm not the tallest of hackers around here :)

[07:14] <audreyt> TreyHarris: sure, as long as the doer doen't define BUILD

[07:14] *** zakharyas joined
[07:15] <gaal> was i totally wrong about bu- being a particle for wave words? weird.

[07:15] <agentzh> gaal: lol

[07:15] <audreyt> or, if both cooperate and define BUILD as multi, that will cause both be visited

[07:15] <agentzh> gaal: bu4 means nope

[07:15] <audreyt> gaal: gao1 is a common family name :)

[07:15] <agentzh> gaal: very common, actually. much more common than mine (zhang1).

[07:15] <gaal> and i get cl as a relative? neat.

[07:15] <audreyt> and in .cn everyday speech (but not .tw), "gao1" also means "high" in english's other meaning

[07:16] <audreyt> as in excited

[07:16] <agentzh> lang4 means waves.

[07:16] <agentzh> *nod*

[07:16] <agentzh> gao! shi zai shi gao!

[07:17] <agentzh> gaal: if you like it, i'll fix my slides using your shiney new chinese name. :)

[07:18] <TreyHarris> audreyt: hmm.  i have many classes whose new() says something like "my $proto = shift; my $class = ref($proto) || $proto; croak "Attempt to instantiate abstract class" if $class eq __PACKAGE__; # proceed with common object instantiation"

[07:18] <TreyHarris> with the idea that those that use it as a base will call NEXT in their own new (if they want to override something)

[07:20] <gaal> sure! does it work in Chinese to do { temp $name = "gao1 xing1 lang4" } when I'm feeling subversive?

[07:20] <TreyHarris> so the perl 6 words work well for the concept: i create such uninstantiable classes when the instantiable class *is* a type of the uninstantiable class, rather than simply being a class that *does* what the uninstantiable class does

[07:23] <agentzh> gaal: well, it worked 20 years ago in china. :)

[07:24] <agentzh> or maybe 30 years ago.

[07:24] <gaal> good then. thanks! :)

[07:25] <agentzh> hmm...i've found gao1 lang4 very cool!

[07:25] <agentzh> audreyt++

[07:26] <agentzh> i'll tell the origin of gaal's chinese name to the audience tonight. :)

[07:26] <ajs_home> TreyHarris: I replied to your mail. I think you're confusing yadda methods with interfaces. A role is only an interface when all of its methods are undefined per S12....

[07:26] <gaal> :)

[07:27] <TreyHarris> audreyt: I thought that the ordinary way to declare BUILD was as a submethod?  Then the default new calls all the BUILDs for you, right?

[07:28] <agentzh> gaal: fixed. see naming.xul slide 15 and get a feeling of it. :)

[07:29] <gaal> yay :) agentzh++ audreyt++

[07:29] <gaal> "slothlike" doesn't translate succinctly, does ir

[07:29] <gaal> *it

[07:30] <agentzh> gaal: hmm

[07:31] <gaal> I actually have no idea - it just looks long

[07:31] <TreyHarris> ajs_home: you're referring to S12:851?  I read that as an operational observation, not as a definition of an "interface".  It seems absurd to me that if you have an interface role with "method is { ... }", that you aren't allowed to declare "method isn't { ! .is }" without no longer being an interface

[07:31] <agentzh> gaal: i can't find a better way to translate that word. :(

[07:31] <agentzh> gaal: however, it reads well to chinese folks. :)

[07:31] <agentzh> gaal: although a bit long. :D

[07:32] <gaal> "sloth" is an animal. maybe use the chinese word for it? though that might not carry the English/Christian connotations.

[07:32] <gaal> okay, whatever works :)

[07:32] *** rashakil joined
[07:32] <gaal> I obviously can't criticize chinese. Was just making an observation.

[07:33] <agentzh> gaal: thank you :)

But when I try to compile, I get, "Ambiguous occurrence `Nothing'... It could refer to either `Main.Nothing', defined at MyTest.hs:6:21, or `Data.Maybe.Nothing', imported from Data.Maybe at MyTest.hs:4:0-16"

[08:33] <TreyHarris> if i change my Nothings to "Data.Maybe.Nothing", it tells me "Not in scope: data constructor `Data.Maybe.Nothing'

[08:35] <TreyHarris> oh, well.

[08:35] <audreyt> are you importing Data.Maybe?

[08:36] <audreyt> import qualified Data.Maybe;

[08:36] <TreyHarris> yes... program starts "module Main; where; import Data.Maybe"

[08:37] <audreyt> so import it qualified will fix it

[10:42] <rodi> currently, the way that Makefile.PL finds hsc2hs is to simply substitute "hsc2hs" in for "hsc", which appears not to work on your system.

[13:01] <audreyt> *smile*

[13:02] <agentzh> and the students laughed a lot when i was talking about gaal's chinese name. ;-)

[13:02] <agentzh> now every student in my C.S. department knows larry, audrey, and gaal. yay!

[13:23] <audreyt> or remove parrot embedding altogether

[15:18] <gaal> yeah, that's a Heinlein quote.

[15:18] <salty-horse> I read that part a only week ago :)

[15:25] <count_leto> hey... could anybody tell me why pugs doesn't want to interpret my smartmatch operator?

[15:28] <count_leto> I've found that in a tut

[15:29] <[particle]> where?

[15:29] <lambdabot> Title: PerlCommunityWiki ª Wissensbasis ª Perl6TutorialKapitel4, http://tinyurl.com/jvqu5

[15:31] <[particle]> you should probably correct the example in the wiki, then

[15:31] <count_leto> well, [particle], your version causes my pugs to complain about an 'unexpected "m"'...

[15:31] <PerlJam> count_leto: perhaps you need a newer pugs?

[15:31] <count_leto> I installed yesterday (maybe 2 days ago... cant remember) ...

[15:32] <count_leto> but from a debian-package.

[15:32] <pasteling> "[particle]" at 144.81.84.167 pasted "my pugs session log" (38 lines, 1.5K) at http://sial.org/pbot/20058

[15:32] <[particle]> take a look at that log, count_leto

[15:33] <[particle]> ...and what version does 'pugs -v' give you?

[15:33] * PerlJam installs ghc again so he can build pugs

[15:33] <count_leto> 6.2.10

[15:34] <[particle]> latest is 6.2.12, .10 is pretty old

[15:34] <count_leto> well, the error at the beginning is quite the same that occurs on my machine.

[15:34] <audreyt> "$text ~~ $result m/Test/;" is not valid syntax anyway

[15:35] <count_leto> hm...

[15:35] <count_leto> I'll install version .12 and complain again later, mkay? ;-)

[15:36] <audreyt> that part is version independent :)

[15:36] <count_leto> that doesn't make my problem smaller... I think

[15:37] <count_leto> after correcting a typo and using [particle] 's code snippets, I get '*** Cannot parse PGE: Test'

[15:38] <count_leto> pugs leaves me questioning my mental sanity

[15:38] <audreyt> ok... one thing at a time

[15:38] <audreyt> first. can you give me your email address so I can send you a commit bit? :)

[15:38] <audreyt> second, install "subversion" and "ghc6" via apt, and run "svn co http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs ; cd pugs ; perl Makefile.PL ; make"

[15:39] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 13721: /

[15:39] <gaal> libperl-dev also

[15:39] <audreyt> once you got the invitation mail, while waiting for pugs to build, edit the AUTHORS file and "svn ci AUTHORS" to make sure the commit works

[15:40] *** weinig is now known as weinig|coffee

[15:41] <count_leto> that all sounds great, audreyt and I thank you for helping me... but what is it I'm installing at the moment? :)

[15:42] <gaal> count_leto: it's the latest code from source control

[15:42] <gaal> since we haven't had a release in a while

[15:42] <gaal> (though one is coming up soon)

[15:42] <gaal> but this is the best way to keep yourself up to date.

[15:43] <gaal> ghc is the compiler used to build pugs itself.

[15:43] <gaal> subversion is a revision control system (like, but better than, cvs)

[15:43] <count_leto> okay...

[15:44] <audreyt> and the reason that the latest revision is relevant is that "Cannot parse PGE" is gone from the set of possible errors

[15:44] <audreyt> and so your sanity may be preserved a bit better :)

[15:44] <count_leto> not that I'm questioning it anyway, hm? ;)

[15:45] <count_leto> in which directory should i run the commands ("svn co http://..." pp.)

[15:45] <gaal> it will create a subdir called 'pugs' wherever you run it.

[15:46] <gaal> so if you have an ~/src/ directory you like to keep projects in, that's a good place.

[15:46] <gaal> but the general answer "it doesn't matter"

[15:46] <count_leto> thanks.

[15:46] <count_leto> *g*

[15:47] <gaal> when you use subversion, btw, you can mv the pugs directory to other places

[15:47] <audreyt> sanity is a controlled substance around here

[15:47] <gaal> periodically, run 'svn up' at the top level to update your sources. this will be much faster than your current full checkout.

[15:47] <audreyt> we need to caliberate your sanity level to touch insanity but not beyond :)

[15:48] <count_leto> lol

[15:48] <count_leto> thanks again, gaal

[15:49] <gaal> sure!

[15:49] * audreyt gives up on repairing parrot embedding

[15:49] <audreyt> the packfile segment init sequence doesn't work anymore :/

[15:49] <audreyt> maybe when leo/chip is around tomorrow

[15:50] <gaal> I have to go now too *lang4*

[15:50] <count_leto> cu

[15:52] * count_leto wonders what lang4 could mean

[15:56] <count_leto> after long contemplation, I found the answer...

[15:56] <audreyt> "wave" in chinese

[15:56] <gaal> it's a silly lang4 joke

[16:06] <audreyt> count_leto: I fixed the wiki, btw.

[17:15] <lanny> It's a stretch but all elven ships might have had silver masts.  But yeah.

[17:15] *** count_leto left
[17:15] <TreyHarris> lanny: silver is a color or character as well as a substance.  it could be painted, or glinting in the light....

[17:16] <lanny> The placement of the ';'s almost has me thinking the oar, sail, mast clause is just an aside though.

[17:16] <cjeris> silver could be used figuratively to describe the color of birch or other pale wood?

[17:16] <TimToady> I'm not sure elves believe in paint...

[17:17] <lanny> Or Malorn (sp?)

[17:17] <lanny> Been too long.  Need to re-read the books although not sure I can get up enough energy for the Silmirillion.

[17:18] <cjeris> many woods are a silvery gray color after enough weathering, anyway.

[17:18] <lanny> ooh.  Scary.  Might have stumbled onto a good coding of roundrobin()

[17:18] <lanny> Sure wish I *knew* what I was doing instead of just casting around until stuff works.  :/

[17:20] <nothingmuch> gaal: benewed on your english name =)

[17:21] <nothingmuch> err

[17:21] <nothingmuch> freudian slip

[17:21] <nothingmuch> i meant engrish ;-)

[17:21] <TreyHarris> TimToady: one of my coworkers waved me over the other day and showed me an essay from Paul Graham's last book, where he shows why ruby and lisp are better than perl because creating a closure-based accumulator takes three fewer syntactic elements in those two languages than in Perl 5.  the coworker wanted to know how it would be in Perl 6.  you'll be happy to know that placeholders and blocks always being closures has, according to graham at least, now ...

[17:21] <TreyHarris> ... made Perl 6 as powerful as Ruby and Lisp. :)

[17:21] <nothingmuch> fwiw, it's cool that lang4 is a syn for gaal in heb ;-)

[17:23] <lanny> Hmm.  I always thought the partition was if a language *could* create a closure-based accumulator.  Would seem trivial to say Perl 6 now has builtin $*CLOSURE_BASED_ACCUMULATOR.(3).  We win!

[17:25] <TreyHarris> lanny: i agree, i think it's silly.  but graham's assertion seems to be that the less syntactic elements required to do any given thing, the more powerful the language.  this follows i suppose from physics' definition of "power"... you wield more force with each keystroke...

[17:25] <TimToady> that's like "there's only one measure of IQ"

[17:25] <TimToady> someone needs to write "The Mismeasure of Programming Languages"

[18:58] <evalbot_r13730> ::List

[18:58] <lanny> Shouldn't that be (1,)

[18:58] <gaal> no, I was curious! I never saw those before.

[18:58] <gaal> lanny: did you find the answer to your haskell question?

[18:58] <TimToady> list() just puts the 1 into list context.

[18:58] <TimToady> which the 1 ignores.

[18:58] <lanny> Yep.  Well more stumbled across it.  Implemented roundrobin() and cat()

[18:58] <lanny> aha

[18:58] <lanny> Tricksy.

[18:59] <ajs_work> TimToady: A while back you said that we were abandoning term constants where possible. Did you mean to include the math constants such as pi and e? Should they be $pi and $e respectively?

[18:59] <yts> @@ ----> which means i feel confused

[18:59] <gaal> what are roundrobin and cat?

[18:59] <lanny> S29/Container

[18:59] <lanny> roundrobin is like each but drops the undefs.  cat just concatenates its sliced arguments

[18:59] <TimToady> originally from S09 and feed operators

[19:00] <TimToady> so we can have useless-use-of-cat awards in Perl 6

[19:00] <lanny> ?eval cat(1)

[19:00] <evalbot_r13730> (1,)

[19:00] <gaal> roundrobin's a bit like zip*

[19:00] *** glasser left
[19:00] <gaal> but flattened.

[19:00] <lanny> Well zip returns tuples (really arrays?)

[19:01] <evalbot_r13730> (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3)

[19:02] <gaal> yts: cute!

[19:03] <TimToady> ajs_work: obviously, those should be œÄ and ‚ÑØ ‚ò∫

[19:04] <ajs_work> but should they be $? and $?? Actually, I'm not sure about ?, but certainly ? was already in API/Math/Basic.pod

[19:04] <TimToady> in general, I'm not worried if a few things like "pi" and "e" sneak through, since people won't be confused about whether they take arguments.

[19:05] <ajs_work> What about Math::Basic vs. Num vs. Int, etc. Should I migrate the API doc to Num and (where integers are involved) Int?

[19:05] * [particle] used to use an exception function named e() frequently

[19:06] <ajs_work> [particle]: If it took parameters, you're fine ;)

[19:07] <ajs_work> I'm still struggling to figure out some of the Array/Seq/List delineation, and I want to know what your thinking is on Int/Num/Math before I check in any of that

[19:08] <TimToady> I don't believe in Math

[19:08] <TimToady> it's not a type

[19:09] <ajs_work> I think Ron intended it to be a library that provided the general math functions, but if we're going with types as the guiding rule for finding functions in S29, then I'll keep that in mind for the others too, and re-name / break up Math::Basic API

[19:09] <ajs_work> Ahem. Rod that is

[19:11] <ajs_work> I don't know if we can do that as easily for the stuff that's currently in OS, though. I'll think about that

[19:11] <araujo> TimToady, hah

[19:11] *** mdiep joined
[19:12] <TimToady> the OS can be viewed as a (singleton?) object.

[19:12] <ajs_work> heh, well I suppose so ;)

[19:12] <TimToady> I'm not sure what a Math object is...

[19:12] <ajs_work> I think that's a chalkboard.

[19:15] <yts> i have already make ...how should i run pugs ?

[19:15] <TimToady> ./pugs

[19:16] <yts> ohoh

[19:16] <TimToady> was that o-hoh or oh-oh?

[19:16] <yts> oh-oh~

[19:17] <yts> i see :p

[19:17] <TimToady> oh-oh is bad

[19:17] <yts> maybe i can type oh-oh!

[19:17] <ajs_work> heh

[19:17] <yts> sorry, i just use as chinese

[19:17] <lanny> Hmm.  Tempted to make eqv work for tests by sub infix:<eqp> ($a, $b) { $a.perl eq $b.perl; }.  It seems faster than eqv as well.

[19:18] <lanny> Not sure it's a robust solution for the long term though.

[19:19] <TimToady> well, eqv is defined in terms of serialization, but the hope is that both sides can be serialized lazily so it falsifies without having to completely serialize both sides first.

[19:19] <TimToady> it's also not entirely clear how much canonicalization can go on

[19:20] <TimToady> but that's why eqv has optional arguments to specify what you mean.

[19:20] <lanny> A telling points.  Guess I'll live with :depends<eqv> for now.

[19:20] <TimToady> and why the semantics of eqv are closely bound with cmp and sorting.

[19:22] <TimToady> and why eqv should optionally take a signature saying which parts you want to compare.

[19:23] <TimToady> hmm, a sig for sorting could use :1($foo), :0($bar) to sort on bar before foo...

[19:24] <TimToady> unless we want to reserve that for radix conversion in binding somehow.

[19:24] <lanny> The signatures as Comparitors for sort() didn't make a lot of sense to me.

[19:24] *** mdiep joined
[19:25] <lanny> Sorry.  signature as Criterion

[19:25] <TimToady> signatures are good at picking out and naming bits of things.  they're less good at specifying an order different from the positionals...

[19:26] <TimToady> so maybe if you want that you go ahead and write the corresponding body.

[19:26] <TimToady> sigs as Criteria is just for the cases where it can write the body for you.

[19:26] *** theorbtwo joined
[19:27] <lanny> So are we talking:  sort :(Str $name, Num $val), @array_of_KeyVal_objects;  ?

[19:27] <TimToady> there's some potential confusion there though with :($a,$b) looking like an old-fashioned comparator

[19:28] <lanny> I think I'm missing how signatures get mapped to values.

[19:28] <TimToady> so maybe the notation needs to clarify that it's binding the sig to a single $a arg.

[19:28] <TimToady> that's what binding is.

[19:32] <lanny> Is that binding still to be spelled out in the Synopses?  I'm looking at hits of 'signature' and 'signature binding' across them but don't seem to be finding anything appropriate.

[19:34] <TimToady> see S06:1171.  this is a slight generalization of that idea.

[19:38] <lanny> Ok.

[19:38] <TimToady> basically, when you bind a signature the binder can pretend most objects are Captures and do something sensible to name the bits.

[19:39] <TimToady> the generalization here is that sort will take the named bits and assume you just want them sorted in the order named, each according to its own type.

[19:39] <TimToady> so numeric vs string automatically falls out.

[19:39] <TimToady> for instance.

[19:39] <TimToady> "is descending" does not fall out of the type info though.

[19:39] <lanny> Right.  I figured that was the idea.  I'm just thinking how to add it into the sort() I've got.

[19:40] <TimToady> probably need to way till Captures/Signatures are fully hacked in.

[19:40] <TimToady> *wait

[19:40] <lanny> There are some other little questions on sort() that came out of trying to implement it.

[19:41] <TimToady> I've got a few minutes while I eat lunch over my laptop.

[19:41] <TimToady> if they're heavy questions, though, p6l is fine.

[19:42] <lanny> For instance a Pair Criterion is composed of a KeyExtractor and Comparitor.  But those can take descending, insensitive.  So could you have ( { +$^a} is descending => { ~$^a cmp ~$^b} is insensitive)?

[19:42] <lanny> I should put them to p6l.  I'm sure you could resolve em but that would also give a wider view and record them on something a bit less transient.

[19:43] <TimToady> I'm not sure the "return a number or string" approach is quite right, since we'd like to have that info at compile time.

[19:44] <TimToady> and while we could inspect the body, it's not guaranteed to be there yet.

[19:44] <lanny> Yeah.  But doing it all in Haskell right now is way beyond my level and doing it in Perl 6 wasn't.

[19:44] <lanny> The core algorithms are working when I test stuff against Code for KeyExtractors and Comparitors

[19:44] <TimToady> the advantage of the sigs is that you can see the types at compile time

[19:45] * lanny nods

[19:45] <TimToady> but there's no reason it can't fallback to runtime, I guess.

[19:45] <lanny> I figured something like sort would end up deep in the language instead of up at the Prelude

[19:45] <TimToady> hard to say--depends on how powerful P6 actually ends up.

[19:45] <TimToady> we are making Captures and Signatures visible, after all.

[19:46] <TimToady> well, need to commute...

[19:46] <lanny> Laters.

[19:47] <theorbtwo> (larry + work) == (work + larry)

[19:47] <TimToady> afk &

[20:01] <yts> i have build pugs and i can run pugs now. it's now a little like hugs...

[20:01] *** Limbic_Region joined
[20:02] <lanny> Not surprising since it's built on top of Haskell.

[20:04] <yts> so is there any thing i can do for pugs?

[20:04] <lanny> Lots.  :)

[20:04] <yts> i learn a little Haskell,

[20:04] <lanny> Look through the source directories and read any READMEs or TASKS.

[20:05] <lanny> I constantly go back to this http://search.cpan.org/~autrijus/Perl6-Pugs-6.2.12/lib/Pugs/Doc/Hack.pod

[20:05] <lambdabot> Title: Pugs::Doc::Hack - How to hack on Pugs - search.cpan.org, http://tinyurl.com/km8q3

[20:05] <lanny> The easiest thing to do is probably write tests and/or put smartlinks in the tests.

[20:06] <[particle]> the algorithm is simple: 1 while do_something_useful( find_something_interesting() );

[20:07] <lanny> Also it's not too bad to add simple operators that aren't in the language yet.  The monads can be a bit daunting at first but if you understand the IO monad it's easy to see what's going on.

[20:07] <lanny> At least that's how it's been for me.

[20:08] <yts> Hm...i think i should play perl6 first :p

[20:09] <lanny> Just do that until you bump into something you want that isn't implemented.  It's very motivational.  :)
