[15:16] <TimToady> @tell TreyHarris for P5, maybe autovivification is the most useful DWIM.  For P6, smart matching (and its use in switches) is perhaps a better example.

[15:31] <Debolaz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vaporware <- Should I remove perl 6 from this list? I mean, even though parrot could arguably belong there, I don't feel perl 6 itself classifies as vaporware and claiming it's been over a decade in development sounds just wrong.

[15:32] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yhq7rz

[15:32] *** justatheory joined
[15:34] <fglock> Debolaz: rather than remove, how about explain how is the development going on and provide links ?

[15:37] <TreyHarris> TimToady: thanks!

[15:37] <lambdabot> TreyHarris: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[15:39] <PerlJam> Debolaz: neither parrot nor perl6 are vaporware except in as much as they don't have a "product release"  However the development releases are already useful and used.

[15:41] <Debolaz> PerlJam: It is not my personal opinion that parrot is vaporware, but I do know many peopel who do feel that way.

[15:42] <Debolaz> s/peopel/people/

[15:43] <PerlJam> Debolaz: well, when you update the page you can put a note to the effect of what I just said  :-)

[15:43] *** nezcaz joined
[15:44] <TreyHarris> Debolaz: depending on your perspective, "it's" been "in development" for a couple years, for six years, for two decades, for five decades, or pick some arbitrary point in the history of computer science. :)  but i can't see what happened in the mid-90's timeframe that would justify "over a decade"

[15:44] <nezcaz> helo *

[15:45] <PerlJam> TreyHarris: perl6 has been in development over a decade because perl5 was the one to throw away  ;-)

[15:45] <TreyHarris> unless you count starting with the Perl 5 release.  (kind of odd, unless you assume that the clock on the next version of something always starts the moment the prior version is released)

[15:45] <PerlJam> yes, the "over a decade" comment is just plain wrong.

[15:46] <Debolaz> Well, actually it just says "a decade", not "over a decade".

[15:46] * Debolaz coughs.

[15:46] <PerlJam> Perhaps the original author meant to start counting from the inception of Topaz?

[15:46] <PerlJam> Debolaz: still wrong.

[15:46] <TreyHarris> what happened in 1996?

[15:48] <PerlJam> nothing spectacular that I can remember.  We were firmly in the era of widespread perl5 adoption and perl6 wasn't even a glimmer in someone's eye.

[15:49] <[particle]> i'd classify parrot as vaporware, under the "Overambitious hype" definition in wikipedia's Vaporware entry

[15:49] <Debolaz> I'll just remove perl 6 from the list.

[15:49] <Debolaz> I'm not removing parrot though.

[15:49] <TreyHarris> in any case, that page would be fair game by my limited understanding of wikipedia policies for total deletion.  there are no citations

[15:50] <[particle]> but, i don't ever recall a date being set for parrot release, so perhaps it can't be called vaporware if there are no promises as to when it will be available

[15:50] <TreyHarris> actually, there are four URLs.  so removing every entry but those four would certainly be fairest game :)

[15:51] <PerlJam> If perl6 isn't vaporware, then neither is parrot.

[15:52] <Debolaz> PerlJam: That's not a logical conclusion since parrot isn't perl6.

[15:52] <Debolaz> Parrot can be vaporware (Not saying it is) without perl 6 being vaporware.

[15:53] <[particle]> i doubt many in the technical community classify either as vaporware, as ars technica et al write articles and announcements about them

[15:53] <PerlJam> true, but they both fail the "overambitious hype" test :-)

[15:53] <integral> you can download parrot-xxx.tar.gz but not perl6-xxx.tar.gz :)

[15:53] <[particle]> s/write/publish/

[15:53] <TreyHarris> Debolaz: your edit wasn't technically valid.  you can't remove or add a statement on wikipedia based on your understanding of it's validity.  only based on external sources.  but that page is such a mess, it probably doesn't matter.

[15:53] <Debolaz> There were a lot of articles and announcements (And still is) about Duke Nukem Forever too though. :)

[15:53] <TreyHarris> s/it's/its/

[15:54] <Debolaz> TreyHarris: I probably should've phrased it differently. I'll elaborate on the talk page.

[15:55] <audreyt> you can't download c++-x.y.z.tar.gz either

[15:55] <audreyt> that doesn't mean C++ is vapourware :)

[15:56] <TreyHarris> == audreyt

[16:00] <audreyt> neither is there a parrot that patches PDDs... :)

[16:00] <audreyt> *matches

[16:01] <audreyt> but yes. there's no release of any software that matches the criterion of official perl6, which is pass 100% of tests with zero todos

[16:01] <audreyt> in that sense it's definitely not released :)

[16:04] <Debolaz> TreyHarris: Aight, added a bit to the talk page now.

[16:08] <TreyHarris> Debolaz: i've removed almost everything from the page now anyway

[16:13] <PerlJam> TreyHarris: it's interesting that you cite WP:NOR when WP:V seems to be more appropriate  :)

[16:13] <TreyHarris> PerlJam: WP:NOR always implies WP:V

[16:14] <PerlJam> I'm just poking at you :)

[17:10] <fglock> I wonder if it makes sense to add a switch like '-GPugs::Grammar::Perl6' for selecting the v6.pm grammar

[17:10] <audreyt> I think it does

[17:10] <[particle]> are you going to have a switch for different ASTs?

[17:10] <fglock> audreyt: cool - will do :)

[17:11] <fglock> [particle]: yes, it can be modular

[17:11] <[particle]> so, then it's basically a generic vm

[17:11] <[particle]> compiler/vm

[17:12] <fglock> "if you can't write a complete program, add plugins"

[17:13] <audreyt> TheSentenceBelowSolvesAllProblemExceptForTheSentenceBelowThat

[17:13] <fglock> [particle]: the alternate compilers will still be based on the perl6 compilation subsystem (grammars, precedence parser)

[17:13] <audreyt> OneMoreLevelOfIndirection

[17:13] <fglock> [particle]: much like Parrot :)

[17:13] <audreyt> TheProblemTheAboveSentenceCauses

[17:14] <[particle]> sure, but you can write a C grammar, or a TAP grammar, or a patch grammar, with its own ast, and it's own emitter to <your vm lang here>

[17:14] <fglock> [particle]: or you can write a grammar and use the p6 emitter for free

[17:14] <fglock> emitters

[17:15] <[particle]> well, if the AST is the same
