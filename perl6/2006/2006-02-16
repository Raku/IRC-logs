[17:14] <putter> http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2006-02-16,Thu&sel=36#l76

[17:16] <ingy> putter: yeah but it doesn't barf on YAML-0.58 YAML-Syck-0.22

[17:16] <ingy> maybe a newer YAML::Syck messed it

[17:17] <putter> k

[17:17] <ingy> I'm not sure where audreyt keeps the YAML-Syck code these days

[17:18] <ingy> hmmm. I just synced 0.33

[17:18] <ingy> will try

[17:19] <putter> where did it turn out to be?

[17:20] <putter> tnx

[17:22] <ingy> YAML::Syck picks a really goofy serialization

[17:25] <sili> so can you use yaml to transform yaml?

[17:36] *** Amnesiac joined
[17:41] <putter> So, perl5 *can* have lexical imports.  :)  Because Filter::Simple apparently gets along with Exporter, a module can just slap code with lexical at the top of the source.  You might even be able to get __LINE__ correct (using #line?).

[18:08] <putter> audreyt: feel free _not_ to point to the (ugly) p5 spike code... it's going to be moving anyway... ;)

[18:09] <Limbic_Region> playing catch-up on all the projects you are interested in (but not actively participating in) after a 2 week hiatus is a PITA when you have to squeeze time in at $work to do it

[18:10] <putter> LR: don't think so (re missed something).  audreyt is currently hacking in .il with gaal.  $work was absorbing before the travel.

[18:11] <putter> indeed

[18:13] <putter> pugs well on the way using yaml as the un/dumping form of compiled p6.  which should fix the precompiled prelude slowness issues which have kept it small.  also the yaml dump of the parse tree is coming along.

[18:16] <putter> in other amusements, an experimental p5 regexp engine, doing backtracking recursive descent parsing, built from Regexp::Parser, was passing much of the p5 re_tests.  and supported <subrules>.  so a throw-away toy p6 parser was built on it.

[18:17] <putter> what else has been going on... that's the last 1/2 week or so.  but 2 weeks... I'd have to changelog for that ;)

[18:21] <Limbic_Region> well, I will just look for the next release of Pugs change release but thanks for the quick synopsis
