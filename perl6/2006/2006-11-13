[03:57] * coke realizes the main website never mentioned the hackathon.

[04:03] * coke fixes that oversight, belatedly.

[04:05] * cognominal notes that in regular Perl code interpolated in a regex, there is not much choice in the granularity of backracking.  There is fail and that's it

[04:05] <cognominal> or do I miss something?

[04:15] * eviltwin_b doesn't know but would assume "fail" should backtrack out of the clause containing the closure and trigger any alternatives.  (which doesn't mean that's implemented, or that he's correct in his assumption)

[04:27] <cognominal> well, I want to back out the alternation not the regex

[04:28] <eviltwin_b> so presumably fail is not yet doing the right thing, if it's not doing that

[14:13] * smash_ good afternoon

[14:14] <sjn> Q: I got the impression somewhere that there's work being done on automatic translation between Perl6 and other languages (back and forth, I assume). Have I understood correctly?

[14:17] <xinming> sjn: I think you mean compile perl 6 to other language. :-)

[14:17] <xinming> sjn: and the answer is yes, we can now compile perl 6 into perl 5, javascript, haskell...

[14:20] <sjn> how about the other way around? (JS, P5, Haskell to P6)

[14:33] <xinming> sjn: I think they need a compiler.. ;-)

[14:34] <xinming> sjn: did you ever meet a program which translates machine language in to c? or even into basic...

[14:36] <sjn> AFAIK, they're called "decompilers"

[14:39] <xinming> sjn: What I mean is just a direction.... If you have source, you can translate to other forms easily, So does javascript -> perl 6, the problem is at javascript compiler side.

[14:39] <sjn> Can't name one though. They're kind of mythcal beasts to me :)

[14:43] <avar> andara++ # yay

[14:43] * sjn was thinking "why limit translation to just one direction, when the community anyway is creating 'translation devices' (compilers) from scratch?"

[14:45] <andara> avar : sure. how about pink flying elephants?

[14:47] <avar> no, I hate those

[15:04] <sjn> xinming: Well, I was specifically interested in P6/Parrot/Pugs etc... asm<->C may be a lost cause, but I'm hoping *<->P6 isn't :)

[15:27] <Limbic_Region> S02 also has a couple of .as(Bytes)

[15:27] <Limbic_Region> and .as(ArabicChars)

[15:27] * Limbic_Region thinks that's likely doc bugs though

[15:28] <gaal> there used to be something called .as that did formatting. then it got renamed to .fmt to free .as for ascription.

[15:28] <anatolyv> Limbic_Region: $foo.as(Bytes) is the same as $foo as Bytes same as infix:<as>($foo, Bytes)

[15:28] <gaal> so thanks all.

[15:30] <anatolyv> curiously enough, that misses the discussion in S13, Limbic_Region :)

[15:30] <anatolyv> what's the regexp for "as, provided 'method' is somewhere within 20 chars of it"?

[15:44] <gaal> anatolyv: i don't know the answer, but two things you can do in Rules that you couldn't in regexps is reentrancy and "fail" from within a rule

[15:45] <gaal> well maybe you could in p5 re, but you'd need special robes and stuff

[20:27] <dmq> Is there a Perl6 regex pattern for doing relative backreferences?

[20:28] *** zekvent joined
[20:29] <PerlJam> dmq: what's a "relative backreferece"?

[20:31] *** lisppaste3 joined
[20:33] *** Aankhen`` joined
[20:37] <dmq> well you have a pattern like /(foo)\1/

[20:37] <dmq> thats an absolute back reference

[20:38] <dmq> now  consider a pattern like $qr=/(foo)\-1/; as a hypothetical example.

[20:38] <dmq> so as written those two would be the same.

[20:38] <dmq> but consider something like /$qr$qr$qr/

[20:38] <dmq> the latter Would Just Work. The former pattern couldnt be used that way.

[20:39] <dmq> IOW, how do you embed pattern snippets containing backreferences without using some form of relative backreference.

[20:42] <PerlJam> dmq: good question

[20:43] <dmq> since i just posted a patch for doing the same for recursive patterns im thinking of how it should be done for backrefs.

[20:44] <dmq> so far the best ive come up with is (?\-1)

[20:44] <dmq> :-(

[20:46] <dmq> the other options was some kind of escape like \R-1

[20:46] *** dduncan joined
[20:46] <dmq> or \B-1 \B+1

[20:46] <dmq> or maybe \o1

[20:47] <PerlJam> Well, in perl6 you'd access the "match structure" directly I think.   If $/ is the match object, and $/[0] is $0 (same as $1 in perl5), $/[1] is $1, and so on, you'd probably just use  $/[-1].  But I wonder if that loses the temporal aspect (or left-to-right-ness) in composition.

[20:48] <dmq> er, but wouldnt those follow the same rules as to the difference between $1 and \1 in a pattern?

[20:48] <PerlJam> perl6 doesn't have \1

[20:49] <dmq> it doesnt?

[20:49] <[particle]> nope, that's gone

[20:49] <PerlJam> nope.  You get your variables ($0 and friends) immediately.

[20:49] <dmq> so how does it distinguish between "the contents of this matches nth buffer" and "the contents of the previous matches nth buffer"

[20:50] <dmq> for instance /($1)(\1)/

[20:50] <PerlJam> what do you mean by "previous match" exactly /

[20:50] <PerlJam> ?

[20:50] <PerlJam> okay, the "previous match" is destroyed unless you've saved it somewhere.

[20:51] <dmq> ..\perl -e"$_='foofoo'; /^(foo)/ and /($1)(\1)/ and print $2"

[20:51] <dmq> prints 'foo'.

[20:52] <dmq> so you dont have access to the previous matches result for the next pattern unless you copy it?

[20:52] <PerlJam> I'm not definitive, but that's how I understand it.

[20:54] <PerlJam> It's easy enough to save things though.

[20:54] <PerlJam> IS this something you find yourself doing often?

[20:55] <dmq> oh im not fussed.

[20:55] <dmq> im just trying to extend the perl5 syntax to do things that cant be done currently.

[20:56] <dmq> to a certain extent ive given up on using perl6 as a template since it is so utterly different from perl5.

[20:56] <PerlJam> good plan :)

[20:56] <dmq> But at the same time id prefer not introduce incompatibility if i can avoid it.

[20:56] <dmq> And of course i reckon some of the stuff ive come up against is worth consideration by Larry.

[20:57] <dmq> like being able to do an embedded qr// becomes much more powerful with relative backreferences.

[20:58] <PerlJam> dmq: though, in this case you'd do well to emulate perl6 I think.   Have a "virtual array" holds $1, $2, etc. and is available immediately.

[20:58] <dmq> i dont freedom to do changes like that.

[20:59] <dmq> and we do do that i guess.

[20:59] <dmq> :-)

[20:59] <PerlJam> Well, it's not like someone is going to be dependent upon this thing that you haven't invented yet :)

[20:59] <dmq> no, but im certain people have not been able to do things they should have been able to do because of its absence

[21:00] <dmq> if only because i bumped into the issue myself.

[22:00] <ashleyb> dmq: back from lunch... Hey I've already come across that problem of relative referencese.

[22:01] <ashleyb> for example I am trying to capture something in quotes like:

[22:01] <ashleyb> <tag arg1="doublequote" arg2='singlequote'>

[22:01] <ashleyb> and I need to match the quote marks

[22:02] <ashleyb> so I'll vote for this being a common thing.

[22:03] <ashleyb> the match for that previous tag would be something like:

[22:04] <dmq> i figured i wasnt the only.

[22:04] <dmq> only one

[22:04] <dmq> the question is how to represent it tho.

[22:05] <ashleyb> qr/arg1=("|')<-[$0]>+$0 arg2("|')<-[$1]>+$1/

[22:05] <ashleyb> but that would, as you say be easier and more generalizable without the absolute references.

[22:05] <dmq> lets hope you do a char class and not an alternation tho eh?

[22:06] <ashleyb> alternation?

[22:06] <dmq> Sorry, thats beside the point. Yes i agree its exactly this type of thing i had in mind.

[22:07] <dmq> well using perl5 syntax you wrote ("|') but youd be better off saying ["']

[22:07] <ashleyb> but that doesn't capture.

[22:07] <ashleyb> and that is perl6 syntax

[22:07] <dmq> right, but even still youd be better off saying (["']) than saying ("|')

[22:07] <ashleyb> ok

[22:07] <ashleyb> fiar

[22:07] <ashleyb> fair

[22:08] <dmq> buts its a totaly distraction from the core point. sorry

[22:08] <dmq> :-)

[22:08] <ashleyb> maybe the '$/[-1]'

[22:08] <ashleyb> is the best thing.

[22:08] <dmq> yeah, something like that I would express like

[22:08] <dmq> er, well, never mind. you get it.

[22:09] <dmq> im not up to translating perl6 regexes to perl5 right now.

[22:09] <dmq> :-)

[22:09] <dmq> the syntax you propose might work in perl6, but i need a perl5 solution.

[22:10] <ashleyb> use pugs::compiler::rule?

[22:10] <dmq> im starting to think the best i can come up with is (?\-1)

[22:10] <ashleyb> that's what I'm doing

[22:10] <dmq> im working on extending the perl5 regex engine.

[22:10] <ashleyb> ah

[22:10] <ashleyb> ok

[22:11] <dmq> im just here for cross fertilization as it were. :-

[22:11] <dmq> )

[22:17] * cj poos on dmq

[22:19] <dmq> er, wrong kind of fertilizer. :-)

[22:21] <dmq> its been suggested that a solution is to implement something like @/in perl5.

[23:36] <GeJ> m¯¯se everyone

[23:38] <GeJ> If I remember correctly (but I may certainly be wrong), TimToady said that Perl 6 would be written in Perl 6. Is this still the plan?

[23:38] <nothingmuch> GeJ: yes

[23:39] <GeJ> hello nm

[23:39] <[particle]> although we have future plans to convert the source to perl 7

[23:41] *** buetow joined
[23:42] *** zekvent left
[23:43] <GeJ> Since TimToady stated that there won't be The One Perl 6, but several implementations as long as they pass the official test suite. Those implementations will be bootstrappers like pugs is. correct?

[23:45] <nothingmuch> GeJ: not necessarily

[23:45] <nothingmuch> it's less "official" than you think, i suspect

[23:45] <nothingmuch> but for perl to Not Suck‚Ñ¢ it should be self hosting

[23:46] <GeJ> hum, not sure to follow you.

[23:46] *** cjeris left
[23:47] <[particle]> perl 6 has features that make implementation much easier if it's self-hosting

[23:48] <GeJ> I think I didn't grok the "self hosting" part.

[23:49] <nothingmuch> well

[23:49] <nothingmuch> perl 6 is supposed to be a good language for writing compilers and stuff like that

[23:49] <nothingmuch> high expressiveness

[23:49] <nothingmuch> good support for transformations

[23:49] <nothingmuch> powerful data types

[23:49] <nothingmuch> powerful control flow

[23:50] <nothingmuch> one of the design checks is making sure that it can be cleanly implemented in itself

[23:51] <GeJ> ok

[23:52] <GeJ> but at some point there'll be the bootstrap issue. Hence the need of implementations like pugs. right?

[23:53] <nothingmuch> precisely
