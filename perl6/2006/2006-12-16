[18:37] <allbery_b> aside from, ghc 6.4 / 6.5 support has been dropped as was previously announced

[18:37] <allbery_b> oh.  *that* would require a tome :)

[18:37] <Mahmoud> perl 5 support?

[18:40] <jnthn> There must have been a release in the last six months...

[18:44] <allbery_b> [22:25] <svnbot6> r14895 | audreyt++ | * Remove support for GHC 6.4.x.

[18:44] <Mahmoud> i see

[18:44] <Mahmoud> any reason to do so?

[18:45] <allbery_b> one suggested by the commit messages:  pugs has been using a bunch of hand-rolled types and implementations thereof that are in the 6.6 base

[18:52] <masak_> jnthn: yes, I believe that Pugs 6.2.13 was released on October 17

[18:52] <masak_> at least http://search.cpan.org/~audreyt/Perl6-Pugs-6.2.13/lib/Perl6/Pugs.pm says so

[22:35] <luqui> I'm having trouble building pugs: Setup: error reading ./.setup-config; run "setup configure" command?

[22:36] <luqui> this might be important: Setup: cannot satisfy dependency network-any

[22:37] <audreyt> luqui: hm. how did you install your GHC?

[22:37] <luqui> portage

[22:37] <allbery_b> make sure you have ghc 6.6 and its extra-libs package

[22:37] <luqui> apparently network is a package that I didn't have.  I'm installing it now

[22:38] <luqui> there she blows

[22:39] <stevan> luqui!!

[22:39] <luqui> I'm back again... could be for a weekend like last time.

[22:39] <luqui> how goes it?

[22:39] <stevan> it goes, and you?

[22:39] <audreyt> just settling into new residence; finally found time to hack

[22:39] <audreyt> stevan: how's $job?

[22:40] <stevan> audreyt: the $client is going on vacation till new year,.. so hopefully it will be very very quiet

[22:40] <audreyt> yay

[22:40] <stevan> and we are going to be hiring a new minion soon as well

[22:40] <stevan> audreyt: yours?

[22:41] <audreyt> less crazy than before

[22:42] <audreyt> changed from 3-4day/wk to 1-2day/wk for field work

[22:42] <audreyt> so much more time at home

[22:42] <stevan> very nice

[22:42] <audreyt> takes effect from this week

[22:42] <audreyt> we'll see how it goes

[22:42] <audreyt> new place is wonderful for hacking :)

[22:43] <luqui> audreyt, you mean it is a room?

[22:43] * stevan just got a new chair,.. not as exciting as a new home, but its still very nice :) 

[22:43] <audreyt> luqui: no, an apartment with garden, located on a pleasant mountain nearby taipei

[22:44] <luqui> nice

[22:44] <audreyt> stevan: ooh. I got a new extremely comfortable hacking chair as well

[22:44] <audreyt> hideously expensive but so far seems to be worth it

[22:44] <luqui> oh, stevan, you got 1-up'd

[22:44] * stevan sulks

[22:44] * audreyt purrs

[22:45] <stevan> audreyt: so we are gonna start using a combo of Ocaml and Perl at $work

[22:45] <audreyt> nice!

[22:45] <luqui> yummy

[22:45] <stevan> I pondered Haskell,.. but I needed something which would be easier to do imperitive stuff in if I needed it

[22:45] *** Coleoid joined
[22:45] <audreyt> ocaml is wonderful for production

[22:45] <stevan> yes :)

[22:45] <audreyt> curiously though the only reason why ocaml isn't used for $job here

[22:46] <audreyt> is that it can only run in interpreted mode on AIX

[22:46] <audreyt> which makes it far slower than GHC

[22:46] <stevan> hmm

[22:46] <stevan> we mostly deploy on FreeBSD , so I should be safe

[22:46] <stevan> I am polishing up my "port" of TestSimple right now

[22:46] <audreyt> nice

[22:49] <luqui> so what is the state of pugs?

[22:49] <luqui> what's the the maximum accomplishment satisfying: accomplishment size / (now - date finished)

[22:51] <audreyt> v6/ mostly

[22:52] <audreyt> selfhosted parser, grammar engine, compiler for a subset of perl6

[22:52] <audreyt> that gens p5 and PIR

[22:52] <audreyt> (see miniperl6 spec)

[22:52] <audreyt> v6/v6-MiniPerl6/miniperl6-spec.pod

[22:52] <audreyt> GHC 6.7 is amazingly fast

[22:52] <audreyt> on macintel here with GHC 6.7 in perf build, a fresh pugs make is..

[22:52] <audreyt> real    3m39.008s

[22:53] <audreyt> used to take 12m or so

[22:53] <nwc10> that's 12m for GHC 6.6?

[22:53] <luqui> how's its code generation?

[22:53] <audreyt> yeah

[22:53] <audreyt> luqui: supposedly much improved with SSE 

[22:53] <nwc10> sacrificing PhD students clearly far more effective than sacrificing rubber chickens :-)

[22:53] <audreyt> and a new Core language that elimiates casts

[22:53] <audreyt> nwc10: heh, also GHC's largest real application in GHC

[22:54] <audreyt> so all optimizations goes there

[22:54] <audreyt> pugs gains indirectly because it's doing something resembling what GHC does

[22:54] <stevan> and who said nepotism was bad ;)

[22:54] <nwc10> so the GHC folks are basically writing GHC to compile itself better? (Oh, and improve computer science and get PhDs and all the groupies associated with that)

[22:55] * stevan tries to picture GHC groupies ....

[22:59] <masak> so, are you in Taiwan like, under siege or something?

[23:00] <masak> (maybe I should just go read the relevant Wikipedia page)

[23:00] <audreyt> right

[23:00] <audreyt> it's highly complicated :)

[23:01] * audreyt goes hacking MO back

[23:01] <nwc10> MO?

[23:01] <audreyt> luqui: so the much delayed 6.28.0 release is now only pending the Meta Object (MO) integration

[23:01] <audreyt> it's feature complete, just needs to hook new Pugs.Prim etc into it

[23:02] <audreyt> as outlined in docs/notes/mo-bootstrap-plan.pod

[23:04] <masak> cool. I was wondering what kept 6.28.0 back

[23:15] <masak> complicated indeed

[23:16] <masak> "In addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a policy of deliberate ambiguity." :(
