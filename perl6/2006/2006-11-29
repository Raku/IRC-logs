[03:29] *** sweinig joined
[03:34] <eviltwin_b> ah, and the happydancing finally begins? :)

[03:35] <eviltwin_b> yup

[03:35] <dduncan> TimToady, even with that typo commit, the problem remains?

[03:36] <dduncan> you just changed "expections" to "expection"

[03:36] <dduncan> since you're reading this, I also have feedback on some of your main wording ... specifically, you were using the term "value" in a number of places where "element" may have worked better ...

[03:40] <dduncan> for example, "Perl hash that autodeletes values matching default" maybe is more accurate as "Perl hash that autodeletes elements whose values match default"

[03:40] <dduncan> at least, when I read "values" in the context of a Hash, that doesn't mean "key and value", just "value"

[03:41] <dduncan> now, if "value" means the entire element to you and most people, then fine, leave the present wording

[03:43] <dduncan> mind you, the describing paragraph uses both 'element' and 'value' in the more accurate fashion

[03:45] <dduncan> in the end, the current wording is fine, so I retract any change request

[04:10] <TimToady> I can't believe how many people (including me) noticed the "expection"...  I even got email...

[18:50] <elmex> but i have to see it everytime i read perl6 commit logs, it's making me absolutley sick

[18:50] <gnuvince> elmex: why?

[18:51] <elmex> because it makes no sense to write ++ after everyones name

[18:52] <gnuvince> It's a form of a praise.  Example: audreyt++ is so cool for allowing so many committers into Pugs

[18:52] <gnuvince> or

[18:53] <gnuvince> gnuvince-- committed a change to the repository without testing it, this breaking the entire thing

[19:32] <jrockway> elmex: you need a perl culture lesson, I think

[19:32] <jrockway> people generally approve of something ++ and something --

[19:32] <jrockway> people also approve of Pugs' give everyone a commit bit approach

[19:32] <jrockway> it works, it makes development easy

[19:32] <elmex> jrockway: you mean 'perl6 culture' don't you? i see that ++ thingie almost never on p5p

[19:33] <jrockway> p5p is a different crowd

[19:33] <elmex> right, p5p is not perl eh? :)

[19:33] <jrockway> but head over to #anything-on-irc.perl.org and you'll see it being used

[19:33] <audreyt> no, the karma is from #perl

[19:33] <audreyt> which is the primary perl5 chat channel on irc.perl.org

[19:33] <elmex> aaah, you speak of #perl

[19:33] <audreyt> it's a IRC subculture

[19:33] <elmex> ok

[19:33] <audreyt> not really related to mailing list

[19:33] <jrockway> it shows up on use.perl.org too ;)

[19:34] <audreyt> it's an extension here to use as a postfix sigil to denote people

[19:34] *** evalbot_r14854 joined
[19:34] <audreyt> e.g. "theory++" is a person, but "theory" is likely just a theory

[19:34] <jrockway> yes, makes things much easier to read :)
