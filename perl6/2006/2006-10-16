[02:43] <lambdabot> Title: TAP Matrix - Mon Oct 16 02:14:53 2006 GMT, http://tinyurl.com/y6eafz

[02:44] <dduncan> So that's my first smoke of Pugs-6.2.13-pre1 ... done using GHC 6.6.0 on Mac OS X PPC, normal Haskell runcore

[02:45] <dduncan> all tests passed or appropriately skipped/todod, and the smoke ran in 102.72 minutes

[02:45] <dduncan> which *is* faster than I recall getting in the past, where I typically got around 135 minutes

[02:46] <dduncan> that was a month plus back, though

[02:46] <dduncan> so from what I can see, 6.2.13 is shippable

[02:46] <dduncan> matters of changelog updates etc notwithstanding

[02:47] <audreyt> good!

[02:47] <audreyt> dduncan++

[02:47] <audreyt> I'm working on finalizing the changelog now

[02:47] <dduncan> are you still holding off 'til tuesday?

[02:47] <audreyt> well, tuesday my time

[02:48] <dduncan> that's what I mean

[02:48] <audreyt> which is <14hours from now

[02:48] <audreyt> so yes

[02:48] <dduncan> I see

[02:48] <audreyt> now I'm off to lunch+changelog. thanks for the smoke

[02:48] * audreyt is now reasonably confident of the release

[02:49] <audreyt> (free of Judy GC bugs)++

[02:49] <audreyt> (not having the tuits to get to the end of that)--

[02:50] <audreyt> bbiab &

[02:51] <dduncan> in the process, you may want to address some minor formatting matters in the changelog, such as a blank line in the middle of the bullet-list for Updated Modules, following CGI

[02:51] <dduncan> the blank line probably shouldn't be there

[02:57] <xinming> audreyt: hmm, I want to know if I did wrong on changelog. And so that I can be more helpful in the future. :-P

[12:07] <gnuvince> Does it mean anything that I'm not familiar with?

[12:10] <gnuvince> None, I was just wondering if appending a tilde was similar to person++ that seems popular around here.

[12:17] <Limbic_Region> yes - as of yesterday afternoon

[12:18] <Limbic_Region> but not until I had to take drastic measures

[12:18] <Limbic_Region> make realclean was not sufficient

[12:18] <Limbic_Region> ended up blowing away src/ and several other directories

[12:18] <agentzh> really?

[12:18] <Limbic_Region> as did TimToady on his linux

[12:18] <Limbic_Region> yes - TimToady is the one who gave me the idea

[12:21] <Limbic_Region> let me try and build this morning (just finishing svn up now)

[12:22] <agentzh> Limbic_Region: have you had the tuits to build cygwin ghc?

[12:23] <agentzh> Limbic_Region: the problem may not hit you since i'm using activeperl 5.8.7.

[12:24] <Limbic_Region> agentzh - no, not at all

[12:24] <agentzh> :)

[12:24] <Limbic_Region> apparently, the instructions for cross compiling *should* just work

[12:25] <Limbic_Region> and yet, what I get when I follow those instructions isn't what anyone on the ghc dev list expects

[12:25] <Limbic_Region> so before I can start fixing (or at least identifying) bugs

[12:25] <Limbic_Region> I need to get the build to start (failing dependencies is the problem)

[12:26] <Limbic_Region> I have it starred in my gmail though so I will get back to it eventually

[12:26] <agentzh> lol

[12:26] <xinming> I also got build failure using ghc 6.6

[12:26] <xinming> >_<

[12:27] <agentzh> great~~

[12:27] <Limbic_Region> xinming - if your problem is something with Judy - that's understandable to me

[12:27] <Limbic_Region> if it is something with embedded p5 - no idea

[12:27] <agentzh> glad to see  you're still working on it.

[12:31] <xinming> BTW, I tried it yesterday, and with the same error, and then, I thought, maybe I didn't compile the library, So, today after work, I tried again with a full install of ghc 6.6, still the problem

[12:31] <agentzh> audreyt++

[12:32] <Limbic_Region> morning audreyt

[12:32] <Limbic_Region> or evening as the case may be

[12:32] <audreyt> xinming: weird, did you install GHC with .msi?

[12:32] <audreyt> it should come with the mtl library

[12:34] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[12:35] <audreyt> you installed from source?

[12:35] <audreyt> not bin package?

[12:36] <audreyt> if so you needs the http://haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.6/ghc-6.6-src-extralibs.tar.bz2 too

[12:36] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yyfzxt

[12:36] <xinming> audreyt: No... Because ghc 6.6 isn't in gentoo yet. >_<

[12:36] <xinming> audreyt: I've done that...

[12:36] <xinming> hmm...

[12:37] <xinming> But I'm not sure if that would automatically install them

[12:37] <audreyt> you need to extract both .bz2 into the same place

[12:37] <audreyt> and then configure/make/make install

[12:38] <xinming> first I extract the source tarball, and extract the source, and move all dir in to libraries...

[12:38] <xinming> >_<

[12:38] <xinming> I think It should be the same as what you suggested...

[13:16] <audreyt> the queue is apparently infinite in length.

[13:22] <[particle]> agentzh: ...i'm obviously ignoring that bit, by using moose :)

[13:22] <audreyt> gaal: it's something that guarantees to produce an infinite list of streams no matter how you use it

[13:23] <agentzh> just try to put off the user's burden.

[13:23] <agentzh> some guys don't even know how to use cpan.

[13:33] <[particle]> i'm in the data retrieval/construction phase of implementation

[16:11] <jabbot> ingy: audreyt was seen 1 hours 8 minutes 27 seconds ago

[16:11] <Limbic_Region> (boss going out of town and leaving me in charge)--

[16:12] <ingy> I think I may have figured out a scheme for using M::C without .pmc

[16:12] <ingy> instead of having .pm -> .pmc

[16:13] <ingy> you go from .p -> .pm

[16:13] <ingy> by setting a special author-only PERL5OPT

[16:13] <TimToady> self-modifying .pm?

[16:14] <ingy> th compiled .pm can even have a sanity check for the PERL5OPT

[16:15] <ingy> TimToady: no, just the same .pm -> .pmc dance

[16:15] <ingy> but without the fear and loathing of .pmc

[16:15] <TimToady> how nice it would be if all of make's target files could simply be told "recompile yourself if you feel like it..."

[16:15] <nothingmuch> ingy: thanks =)

[16:15] <ingy> for what nothingmuch ?

[16:16] <nothingmuch> the << fix

[16:16] <TimToady> if you change the .p, what happens to the .pm?

[16:16] <TimToady> assuming you're in "author" mode.

[16:16] <ingy> see if I release YAML with .pmc (as I intend) there will be hell to pay

[16:17] <ingy> TimToady: the .pm is regenerated (if you are in the author environment)

[16:17] <TimToady> that's what I mean by "self-modifying .pm"

[16:18] <TimToady> I'm not making a value judgement, just trying to unnerstann

[16:18] <ingy> but the .pm isn't affecting itself

[16:18] <TimToady> what triggers the recompile?

[16:18] <ingy> it's just templated output of .p

[16:19] <TimToady> what triggers the templated output?

[16:19] <ingy> s/templat/compil/ blah blah

[16:19] *** reZo_ joined
[16:20] <ingy> oh... the PERL5OPT=-MModule::Compile=-p (or whathaveyou) does something like put a coderef in @INC to load .p before .pm

[16:21] <integral> so you're wanting to replace the entirely non magical .pmc,  with deep scary magic?

[16:21] <ingy> integral: no. I want to replace the slightly magical .pmc with the completely accepted .pm

[16:21] <ingy> :)

[16:22] <integral> o_O.  Are there really people scared of .pmc's?

[16:22] <ingy> it's quite sane

[16:22] <TimToady> the main downside I see is that you're essentially defining .pm to be P5 only and inventing a new standard P6 extension

[16:22] <ingy> I think

[16:23] <ingy> TimToady: interesting point. I wasn't thinking in Perl6 terms at all

[16:24] <ingy> but I'm not thinking of getting rid of .pmc

[16:24] <ingy> the current stuff is fine.

[16:24] <kolibrie> I like being able to have a .pm file and run it under perl or pugs and just have it work - the .pmc is nice for that

[16:25] <ingy> I'm just giving an option of getting the same power of M::C but with a .pm output, so I can use it in "production" modules

[16:25] *** andara left
[16:25] <ingy> I don't even have to distribute the .p file

[16:26] <ingy> so you'll never know my code was generated

[16:26] <integral> ugh, please do.  It makes submitting patches much easier (if it's a CPAN module)

[16:26] <ingy> rather than hand coded

[16:26] <kolibrie> hmm, local-only might be okay

[16:28] <ingy> integral: I agree. just making the point

[16:28] <kolibrie> but that is true, sending patches back to the author would be less effective in that case

[16:30] <ingy> I can even see .p -> .pm -> .pmc

[16:30] <ingy> ven for perl6

[16:30] <ingy> e

[16:31] <ingy> where .p is something that generates Perl 6

[16:49] *** chris2 joined
[16:50] <ingy> TimToady: in the shower I realized that one way to think of this is that (by convention or consensus) we use .p->.pm for P5 and .pm->.pmc for P6

[16:50] <ingy> I rather like that.

[16:50] <ingy> It keeps fear and loathing away from P5 curmudgeons and places it squarely in P6 where there is already plenty of it

[16:50] <ingy> it might even please Alias

[16:51] <ingy> doubtful... very doubtful

[16:53] <Juerd> Personally, I'm in favour of dropping .pm and .plx? altogether

[16:53] <Juerd> And I don't see any compelling reason to give executable files an extension that's different from modules

[16:56] <ingy> Juerd: I'm not following you

[16:56] <ingy> dropping .pm from what?

[16:56] <ingy> and what is .plx?

[16:56] *** [particle] joined
[16:57] <ingy> Juerd: actually hold on for one sec. I need to drop off. brb

[16:57] *** ingy joined
[17:00] <Juerd> Dropping use of .pm for Perl 6. Let .plx? and .pm be an indication of Perl 5

[17:00] <Juerd> .plx is an extension used for Perl scripts, like .pl. The book Beginning Perl suggests .plx

[17:05] <xinming> I'll suggest that we use .pl6 for perl 6 scripts, and .pl5 for perl 5 scripts, and .pl defaults to the "current" perl. :-)

[17:05] <xinming> since, we might also need pl7.. *_*

[17:09] <xinming> s/it hurt/it hurts/

[17:09] <xinming> ^^^^  <-- oops

[17:14] <TimToady> I think extensions are of far too limited bandwidth to adequately express version information, and would be good only for rough commentary, and not even good for that once people started relying on it.

[17:33] <Juerd> ingy: So do I. But why try to attach *technical* meaning to them?

[17:33] <Juerd> That was nice in the DOS era :)

[17:34] <ingy> I'm not trying to attach any firm meaning to them

[17:35] <ingy> they don't really mean anything. I was just suggesting a standard practice for M::C

[17:36] <ingy> one that at least I would be interested in following.

[17:37] <ingy> for the millions not in the know, running into a .pmc in P5 CPAN distro is going to at least raise an eyebrow

[17:38] <ingy> but compiling to .pm, who let those millions be blissfully ignorant of ingy's evil coding practices

[22:15] <lanny> Anyone have any experience building pugs on win32 using MinGW and ActiveState?

[22:18] <lanny> @tell Limbic_Region Got MinGW, ActiveState, Subversion, pugs co.  Dieing on nmake to build.  It tries to use cmd.exe and chokes on a too-long command line.  Any suggestions?

[22:18] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[22:18] <[particle]> lanny: what version of nmake? the old ones (1.* have that problem)

[22:19] <lanny> Aha.  1.5

[22:19] <lanny> Seemed to come as part of Activestate Perl.  Where do I find a later?

[22:20] <[particle]> well, i have 7.10, which came with visual studio

[22:21] <[particle]> as far as i know, the only way to get a newer one is to download something like ms visual studio 2005 express and use that one

[22:21] <[particle]> i don't know if someone has packaged a recent nmake seperately

[22:21] <lanny> ewww

[22:21] <[particle]> like i said, i don't know. i haven't had to look for it, you see :)

[22:22] <Limbic_Region> lanny - you are using nmake 1.5

[22:22] <lanny> I am.  From Activestate

[22:22] <Limbic_Region> that wasn't a question, it was a statement

[22:22] <Limbic_Region> that's the problem

[22:22] <lanny> :)

[22:22] <Limbic_Region> hang on, will try and get you something more recent

[22:23] <Limbic_Region> do you have a feather acct?

[22:23] <lanny> I do

[22:23] <Limbic_Region> I will just put it in my home directory with all read access

[22:23] <[particle]> the old nmake distos were just two files

[22:23] <[particle]> nmake.exe and nmake.err

[22:23] <[particle]> perhaps that'll work with a recent one, too

[22:26] <Limbic_Region> lanny - done

[22:26] <Limbic_Region> see /home/limbic/nmake.exe

[22:26] <lanny> Limbic_Region++

[22:26] <lanny> [particle]++ for good measure

[22:26] <Limbic_Region> well, gaal++ too since that's who I got it from

[22:28] <Limbic_Region> [particle] - the executable is standalone so if you know someone who has gone through the trouble of getting it in the large bulky bundle

[22:28] <Limbic_Region> then you are all set

[22:28] <[particle]> great, you'll leave it there then?

[22:28] <Limbic_Region> yes

[22:29] <Limbic_Region> feel free to tell anyone with a feather acct where they can get it

[22:29] <Limbic_Region> but I won't be posting on the web where google can index it

[22:29] <Limbic_Region> likely frowned upon in general

[22:29] <[particle]> :)

[22:29] <[particle]> which version is it?

[22:30] <Limbic_Region> 7 something

[22:30] <Limbic_Region> just a sec

[22:30] <[particle]> great

[22:30] <Limbic_Region> 7.10.3077.0

[22:34] <lanny> Ok.  Can delete it.  Still having troubles with pscp but moved it to my ~

[22:36] <lanny> Odd.  MinGW doesn't want to run pscp but works fine in cmd.exe

[22:36] <Limbic_Region> what is the proper fu to get ls to print out times other than mtime ?

[22:37] <wolverian> --time=foo

[22:37] <wolverian> I'm not sure if you can make it print more than one time. hm.

[23:06] <bsb> does a bare say or print still default to $_ these days?

[23:07] <[particle]> i think you need .say or .print but i'm not sure

[23:20] <Limbic_Region> ?eval $_ = "blah"; say

[23:20] <Limbic_Region> ?eval $_ = "blah"; .say

[23:20] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[blah␤] Bool::True

[23:20] <TimToady> bsb: not anymore. :)

[23:20] <Limbic_Region> it appears pugs' say defaults to empty string though .say does the right thing

[23:21] <TimToady> (assuming my ci ever commits...)

[23:22] <TimToady> well, say by itself should probably just print a newline.

[23:22] <TimToady> and print by itself prints a null string...

[23:22] <TimToady> on the other hand, it's likely to be a common error.

[23:23] <TimToady> so for now we could certainly make print fail on 0 args, I expect.

[23:25] <bsb> syntactically, rather than something that evaluates to 0 args

[23:25] <TimToady> could even force people to use print "\n" to print newline instead of empty say.

[23:25] <TimToady> yeah, syn

[23:25] <TimToady> not sem

[23:25] <TimToady> OR we could just make the dwtm

[23:26] <TimToady> *them

[23:26] <TimToady> but I kinda like the .print discipline

[23:27] <TimToady> pity that .rand can't default to rand(1)

[23:27] <TimToady> well, not without setting $_ to 1...

[23:28] *** bsb left
[23:28] *** bsb joined
[23:28] <TimToady> on the other hand, picking a random int will probably end up with a different idiom: ^$max.pick or some such.

[23:29] <TimToady> hmm, that doesn't work

[23:29] <TimToady> would have to be (^$max).pick.  .ick.

[23:30] <TimToady> pick ^$max then

[23:30] <TimToady> pick 1..100

[23:32] *** jojo joined
[23:32] <TimToady> or we could do away with the optional argument to rand and use "int 3*rand"

[23:33] <jojo> 0|3*rand

[23:33] <TimToady> do you mean (0|3)*rand?

[23:33] <jojo> i mean 0| instead of int

[23:34] <TimToady> I you trying to do a bitwise or?

[23:34] <TimToady> *are you

[23:34] <jojo> bitwise or with 0 is noop, but the side effect is the same as int()

[23:35] <TimToady> but this is #perl6, so it'd have to be 0+|

[23:35] <jojo> ouch

[23:35] <TimToady> since bitwise or is now dehuffmanized to +| or ~| or ?|

[23:35] <TimToady> depending on whether you want numeric or stringwise or boolean.

[23:36] <TimToady> and | is stolen for junctions

[23:36] <TimToady> if $a == 1 | 2 | 3

[23:36] <TimToady> which will be a lot more common in P6 than bitops.

[23:36] <TimToady> given case statements look like:

[23:37] <TimToady> when 1 | 2 | 3  {...}

[23:38] <TimToady> anyway, int is a lot clearer, and that's usually better unless you're golfing it.

[23:38] <bsb> (I didn't know p5's ref defaulted to $_, how embarassing...)

[23:38] <lanny> ?eval say 5.rand()

[23:38] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[4.305245104898988␤] Bool::True

[23:38] <TimToady> ?eval say 5.rand.int

[23:38] <evalbot_r14375> OUTPUT[2␤] Bool::True

[23:39] <jojo> thanks TimToady, that was very understanding

[23:40] <TimToady> ?eval pick ^5

[23:40] <evalbot_r14375> 1.0

[23:40] <TimToady> ?eval pick ^100

[23:40] <evalbot_r14375> 44.0

[23:41] <TimToady> p6's ref defaults to not existing.  :)

[23:42] <jojo> don't we need separate methods for repeatable rand and for secure rand?

[23:43] <TimToady> usually that's handled by srand.

[23:43] <TimToady> ?eval srand 42; pick ^100

[23:43] <evalbot_r14375> 71.0

[23:43] <TimToady> ?eval srand 42; pick ^100

[23:44] <evalbot_r14375> 71.0

[23:44] <jojo> when i strace perl5 srand it reads exactly 32bits from /dev/urandom

[23:44] <TimToady> well, there's secure, and then there's secure...

[23:44] <jojo> that is nowhere near enough to produce random session keys

[23:45] <lanny> Use some library for secure random.  rand() is pretty much an int.

[23:45] <lanny> Or open up /dev/u?random and read the number of bits you need.

[23:46] <TimToady> "/dev/urandom".slurp   :)

[23:46] <jojo> i know how to do it.  but i think it is becoming important enough that it ought to be better handled in the core language

[23:46] <lanny> heh.  Yeah but then you have to wave your mouse around.  Or is /dev/random the one with limited entropy?  Never can remember.

[23:47] <jojo> urandom is the non-blocking one, in linux

[23:47] <lanny> Why handle it in core when libraries work and then you can choose from so many implementations?

[23:48] <jojo> same argument as putting random in the kernel

[23:48] <lanny> I'm hoping that $*RANDGEN becomes the default random object.  Then anyone you wanted that did Rand could be installed.

[23:48] <jojo> even quite good programmers might not be able to tell good random generators from bad ones

[23:49] <TimToady> what you want is some kind of interface for requesting a random number generator that is good enough

[23:49] <jojo> so it is one thing arguably better done in core than in cpan

[23:49] <lanny> I would hope that even quite good programmers aren't trusting a random generator they don't *know* is good for secure apps though.

[23:50] <TimToady> we need CPUs with radium

[23:50] <lanny> And just because it's in core or kernel still doesn't mean it's known good.

[23:51] <jojo> radium, exactly, but then we need a path through the kernel into perl

[23:51] <TimToady> heck, just embed the radium directly into Perl...

[23:51] <jojo> otherwise you offer the programmer a choice between radium and x^y mod z

[23:52] <lanny> Well.  Pugs currently uses a linear congruential.

[23:53] <TimToady> false dichotomy if the kernel has any other timed connections to the real world.

[23:53] <lanny> Because it relies on Haskell

[23:53] <TimToady> since the real world is known to exhibit quantum indeterminacy from time to time.  :)

[23:53] <jojo> there are platforms where you can't trust the kernel

[23:53] <lanny> How random do you want, jojo?  Math::Random::Kiss passes all of DIEHARD and does Rand

[23:54] <jojo> but the kernel is the best place for random

[23:54] <clkao>  

[23:54] <TimToady> grr, monocultures...

[23:57] <evalbot_r14375> Error: pick not defined: VInt 33

[23:57] <TreyHarris> oh... that's equivalent to (pick 33)..77?

[23:57] <TreyHarris> that's... very unintuitive
