[06:24] <audreyt> @tell putter do you perhaps have tuits to turn re::override to use re::engine plumbings dmq hacked so we have a generic perlland overrride hook? see my PCRE entry for some readymade code :)

[06:24] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[06:40] <gaal> audreyt: needs an 'unimport' method too

[10:21] <avar> oh that's another issue actually

[10:21] <avar> it doesn't assume that your PREFIX also has the openssl libs (should it?)

[10:23] <broquaint> IIRC, PREFIX is where stuff is going, it shouldn't change how it looks for libs.

[10:39] <gaal> that's just a default where-to-look-for-them thing. you can enter e.g. /usr at the prompt there and it'll work. the problem i was moosing about was that come install time, N:S is installable but its bundled N:S:Handle is not, because it didn't inherit PREFIX and so wants to be installed in the default system location.

[15:47] <kolibrie> fglock: I'm installing v6.pm from CPAN, but most (if not all) tests are failing to compile

[15:47] <pasteling> "kolibrie" at 66.239.158.2 pasted "fglock: test compilation failures for CPAN v6.pm" (21 lines, 952B) at http://sial.org/pbot/21624

[15:48] <kolibrie> fglock: any ideas what I should try?

[15:49] <pmichaud> are there any accessors/methods defined for Range objects?

[15:49] <pmichaud> (i.e., in the synopses)

[15:54] <fglock> kolibrie: looking

[15:58] <fglock> pmichaud: not afaik; there are some old notes in docs/notes

[15:58] <pmichaud> fglock: okay, thanks.  That's sorta what I figured.

[15:58] <fglock> kolibrie: try updating Module::Compile ?

[15:58] <kolibrie> fglock: okay

[15:59] <fglock> pmichaud: imo, Range should behave just like List

[15:59] <pmichaud> fglock: sure, but one might want to have special methods to obtain the min/max of the range

[16:00] <fglock> and also deal with '~~'

[16:01] <pmichaud> exactly

[16:04] <pmichaud> from t/operators/range.t:

[16:04] <pmichaud> is ~(1 ..^ 4.9), "1 2 3"  , "upper exclusive limit is truncated";

[16:04] <pmichaud> that looks wrongish to me -- I think it ought to be "1 2 3 4"

[16:11] <kolibrie> fglock: removed all copies of Module::Compile, reinstalled Module::Compile 0.20, v6.pm tests still getting same errors

[16:12] <kolibrie> :(

[16:12] <fglock> pmichaud: some info scattered in the specs: s03 - .min and .max values (which change as they are iterated); s09- You can use ranges as types; :by(2); 2..1:by(-1); alphabetic ranges; Range object smartmatches the endpoints

[16:12] <pmichaud> fglock: excellent

[16:13] <fglock> kolibrie: another possible problem, you may have a devel version of PCR installed

[16:13] <wolverian> pmichaud, I suppose it's an integer range, so the exclusivity drops the 4

[16:13] <pmichaud> wolverian: but later in the test we have is ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.9), "2 3", "both exclusive limits are truncated";

[16:14] <pmichaud> er,

[16:14] <pmichaud> is ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.9), "2 3", "both exclusive limits are truncated";

[16:14] <wolverian> pmichaud, that looks correct to me as well. it's 1 ^..^ 4

[16:14] <wolverian> pmichaud, (that is, assuming integers.)

[16:14] <kolibrie> fglock: I deleted all 'Pugs' directories from my site_perl, thinking that might be the case.  Are there other namespaces to delete?

[16:16] <fglock> maybe infix<..> has signature (int, int)

[16:16] <pmichaud> wolverian: oh, so the arguments to infix:.. has in... yes, what fglock just said

[16:16] *** kanru joined
[16:16] <TimToady> I don't think so

[16:16] <pmichaud> I wouldn't think so either :-)

[16:16] <TimToady> ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.9) should produce 2.9, 3.9

[16:17] <pmichaud> oooooh

[16:17] <wolverian> ah. that is more comfortable indeed. 

[16:17] <TimToady> with handwave at floating-point issues

[16:17] <pmichaud> and ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.5) would produce the same?

[16:17] <TimToady> yes

[16:17] <pmichaud> okay, that helps a bunch

[16:18] <pmichaud> I'll see about updating the tests

[16:18] <fglock> kolibrie: I'll reinstall

[16:18] <wolverian> hrm. rationals? 

[16:18] <TimToady> rats would presumably help with that.

[16:18] <pmichaud> I haven't done a lot of test updates in pugs; any conventions I should be aware of ?

[16:18] <kolibrie> TimToady: and what if you want 2.0, 2.1, 2.2,... 4.4?

[16:19] <pmichaud> kolibrie: 2.0..4.4:by(0.1) ?

[16:19] <kolibrie> is that :by(0.1)

[16:19] <TimToady> why not?

[16:19] *** lisppaste3 joined
[16:19] <kolibrie> okay

[16:19] <wolverian> TimToady, would all floating point values be rats, or just when the signature says so? 

[16:19] <TimToady> I think maybe .. stores all its args as rats but produces floats/ints

[16:20] <pmichaud> looks like I'll need a rat type in parrot :-)

[16:20] <pmichaud> a parrat :-)

[16:20] <TimToady> by and large I don't like rats

[16:20] <pmichaud> (I'll obviously cheat and use float for a while)

[16:21] <TimToady> I think that's fine.

[16:21] <pmichaud> TimToady++  # thanks for quick answer

[16:21] <wolverian> I've had some rats under my shirt. it wasn't unpleasant, surprisingly.

[16:21] <TimToady> I had a lizard up my pantleg once...

[16:21] <wolverian> (now, pants would have been something else)

[16:21] <TimToady> that was not pleasant

[16:22] <wolverian> ouch. did you hop around?

[16:22] <TimToady> no, I stood there hollering at my mom with my hands around my thigh to keep it from going higher.

[16:22] <TimToady> she told me to hobble over to the bathroom and take my pants off, which I did.

[16:23] <fglock> kolibrie: same error here

[16:23] <TimToady> the poor lizard thought it had found a nice dark cave to hide in...

[16:33] <kolibrie> does pugs use the installed PCR, or the dev version in the pugs repository?

[16:35] <fglock> kolibrie: not sure

[16:35] <svnbot6> r14866 | pmichaud++ | # 16:16 <TimToady> ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.9) should produce 2.9, 3.9

[16:35] <svnbot6> r14866 | pmichaud++ | # 16:17 <pmichaud> and ~(1.9 ^..^ 4.5) would produce the same?

[16:35] <svnbot6> r14866 | pmichaud++ | # 16:17 <TimToady> yes

[16:37] <pmichaud> hmmmm

[16:37] <pmichaud> my $x = 3.1^..6; say $x.min    produces ... ?

[16:38] <kolibrie> hmm, doesn't look like pugs wants to compile for me either: ghc-6.6: unknown package: mtl

[16:42] <TimToady> pmichaud: still produces 3.1

[16:43] <TimToady> the min and max are just stored.  the ^ says how it's applied.

[16:43] <TimToady> (likewise the :by is just stored, if any)

[16:44] <TimToady> hmm, I wonder if :by should have any influence on a ~~ comparison...

[16:45] <TimToady> $a ~~ 0..10 is defined as 0 <= $a <= 10, but

[16:45] <TimToady> $a ~~ 0..10:by(1) might mean $a == any(0..10)

[16:46] <TimToady> well, === really, since range might be nonnumeric

[16:47] <TimToady> or it might just ignore the :by

[16:48] *** bonesss joined
[16:49] <TimToady> same distinction arises for strings, actually, but I don't know how to write the increment...

[16:49] <TimToady> "bbb" ~~ 'a'..'z'  # true

[16:49] <TimToady> "bbb" ~~ 'a'..'z':by($string_increment)  # false

[16:50] <TimToady> I suppose it's better just to ignore the :by and force people to write any() explicitly if they mean that.

[16:50] <TimToady> or carp about a "useless use of :by", or some such.

[16:53] <pmichaud> TimToady: agreed (with all points)

[16:53] <pmichaud> so, in 3.1^..6  the range object has to "know" that the lower bound is excluded

[16:55] <pmichaud> that makes sense, since we need it to smartmatch that way

[16:55] <pmichaud> okay, works for me

[16:56] <eviltwin_b> kolibrie: make sure you have the ghc-extralibs package installed

[17:03] <eviltwin_b> hm, I wouldn't know what debian calls it

[17:03] <eviltwin_b> but ghc is typically distributed in stripped-down form, stuff like mtl lives in an extra package

[17:04] <kolibrie> eviltwin_b: is there a specific filename I can look for?

[17:08] *** ruz joined
[17:09] <eviltwin_b> that might well make sense if they unbundled it.  I don't have a debian (or indeed a linux) box to check; I'm on a Mac

[17:09] <kolibrie> I'll try it

[17:10] * Limbic_Region hangs his head in frustration

[17:12] * Limbic_Region no longer has perl, pugs, mingw, cygwin, firefox, gvim, haskell, parrot, etc

[17:14] <kolibrie> fglock; with PCR 0.17, v6 fails 3 subtests (two in 07-simple-multisubs.t and one in t/builtins/arity.t).  Anything I have to worry about?

[17:18] <TimToady> Limbic_Region: are you programming a Java toaster or something?

[17:21] <Limbic_Region> If it wasn't meant to be funny then no

[17:21] <Limbic_Region> grrr - this client is eating half of what I type

[17:21] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - if that's funny then I guess I should lookup what a Java toaster is

[17:22] <Limbic_Region> the 3rd line should have preceded the 1st

[17:23] <Limbic_Region> in any case - just a difference of opinion between local ISSO and parent organization.  Until the differences are worked out I have removed all software not installed from image

[17:25] <wolverian> Limbic_Region, ...and soon they'll let you go because you're not productive anymore?
