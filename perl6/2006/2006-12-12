[16:58] <nwc10> perl -wle 'print"&%#+"|"`}[@"&reverse$^X while!select$,,$,,$%,1/$]'

[16:58] <nwc10> will run faster under perl 6 :-)

[16:59] <TimToady> it will, however, produce different output

[17:00] <nwc10> :-)

[17:00] <nwc10> even if $^X still ends "perl" ?

[17:00] <TimToady> let's see.  there's no select. | does something different

[17:00] <TimToady> keywords and listops require a space after them.

[17:01] <nwc10> gosh. yes. I'm forgetting junctions

[17:01] <TimToady> there's no $,

[17:01] <TimToady> or $%

[17:01] <nwc10> it didn't work under perl 4 either :-)

[17:01] <TimToady> or $] for that matter.

[17:01] <TimToady> other than that, should work fine.

[17:02] <TimToady> oh yes, and no $^X either.

[17:02] <nwc10> will there still be 4 argument select?

[17:02] <nwc10> and will the perl6 parser get upset by my "" string ending @ ?

[17:03] <TimToady> no, it won't get upset at that.

[17:03] <TimToady> you can't interpolate an array without [] in perl 6.

[17:03] <TimToady> so you have to say @foo[] to get it to interpolate

[17:03] <TimToady> so email addresses are safe now

[17:04] <TimToady> I don't think either select will be there.  possibly you can get at the old 4-arg select with use POSIX or some such.

[17:05] <TimToady> but async will be built-in to the language at a lower level.

[17:05] <TimToady> if you just want to sleep a while, say sleep(0.25) or whatever.

[17:05] <nwc10> I was about to type something like that :-)

[17:06] <TimToady> the time interfaces are biased towards floating point in P6

[17:07] <nwc10> as to something on-topic, last night I got to the point of making PVBM in blead the same size as PVMG

[17:07] <nwc10> so tonight I think I can eliminate it, and free up a type for doing proxies for 6 on 5

[17:08] <TimToady> cool!

[17:08] <nwc10> but someone else can do that, because I'm not sure how to do it :-)

[17:09] <nwc10> I don't think that it matters if it's done pre 5.10 - I think it can be added in 5.10.1 or 5.10.2 without breaking binary compatibility.

[17:09] <TimToady> as long as the enum is reserved...

[17:09] <nwc10> exactly.

[17:09] <TimToady> sounds like a plan

[17:09] <nwc10> still not totally sure what to do about SVt_PVBM - I think I need to #define it to SVt_PVMG outside PERL_CORE

[17:10] <nwc10> Did you see Aaron Crane's message to perl5-porters about Named-capture regex syntax?

[17:10] <TimToady> recent?

[17:10] <TimToady> haven't read p5p for a couple of weeks...

[17:11] <nwc10> After chatting with dmq (possibly after my question from the audience in dmq's talk) he's wondering if (+<name>pattern) would be better than (?

[17:11] <nwc10> Today. Hot off the proess

[17:11] <nwc10> For anyone wanting to put a face to dmq: http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewblack/318954738/

[17:11] <lambdabot> Title: DSCF0051 on Flickr - Photo Sharing!

[17:12] <nwc10> Actually, the message was 1 hour ago. So not surprised if you'd not seen it

[17:12] <nwc10> I'm just hating some work code.

[17:13] <nwc10> so was reading other e-mail

[17:13] <TimToady> eek, I haven't even started drinking my coffee.

[17:14] <nwc10> So why are you on IRC? :-)

[17:15] <nwc10> I also got PVGV to the same size as PVMG, but I think that it would cause too much pain to merge them.

[17:16] <TimToady> likely

[17:18] <TimToady> my basic opinion is that P5 regex syntax is hopelessly tangled, so it doesn't much matter what you do to it anymore, as long as it doesn't confuse people with different semantics for the same syntax that P6 uses.

[17:21] <nwc10> Right. Seems sane.

[17:21] <nwc10> all the (?? confuse me a lot

[17:23] <broquaint> The ?? pre-empt the confusion that follows.

[17:23] <TimToady> ?? is read "highly questionable"... :)

[17:23] <PerlJam> nwc10: me too, but I've gotten used to the shorter versions of <before: ...> and <after: ...> so much that I wish there were a syntactic shortcut for perl6  :-)

[17:25] <TimToady> you can always define one.  :)

[23:10] <cognominal> "canonical time" appears many time in the synopsis about statement. I suppose it means that optimizer is not allowed to evaluate the statement prematuraly

[23:21] <TimToady> cognominal: it can evaluate it early if it has no side effects, but if there are side effects, they must happen when the naÃ¯ve NFA engine would fire off the closure.

[23:21] <cognominal> thx TimToady 

[23:24] <Limbic_Region> oh hey cognominal - I meant to respond to your inquiry into CPAN oddities

[23:24] <Limbic_Region> something that might be worth perusing is the alternates to 1; at the end of modules to indicate truth

[23:24] <cognominal> Limbic_Region: you probably mean cog instead of cognominal?

[23:24] <Limbic_Region> in my non-CPAN modules I use "This statement is false";

[23:40] <Limbic_Region> after 5.10 that is

[23:41] <Limbic_Region> if so, just get 5.10 out the door and start working on 5.12
