[11:38] <Schwern> Can someone explain to me the difference between fail and die?  Or point me to the appropriate docs?

[11:42] <broquaint> I think fail returns a Failure object where as die properly throws an exception.

[11:43] <broquaint> See. Exceptions and Definition of Success in S04: http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S04.html

[11:43] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 4: Blocks and Statements - perl6:

[11:43] <Schwern> That seems to say that fail returns an undef unless "use fatal" is in effect in which case it throws an exception.

[11:43] <ayrnieu> S29 in my Perl6::Bible has "die\nfail\n    TODO: Research the exception handling system."

[11:44] <broquaint> I think it's an undef with relevant Failure info.

[11:44] <broquaint> e.g "A list is of undefined length only if it contains an undefined generator, which, happily, is what is returned by the fail function when used in list context."

[11:45] <Schwern> Ahh, here it is.

[11:45] <Schwern> The advantage of using fail is that it allows the callers of get_data to decide how that subroutine should signal failure. As explained above, normally fail fails by returning undef. But if a use fatal pragma is in effect, any invocation of fail instead throws the corresponding exception.

[11:45] <ayrnieu> well, ... calls fail; S03 says: If no arguments are given, the operator calls "fail" (returning "undef", or throwing an exception if "use fatal" is in effect).

[11:45] <Schwern> Boy that's handy

[11:46] <broquaint> Larry, you've done it again!

[11:46] <Schwern> Zounds!

[11:48] <Juerd> fail is the configurable error thingy :)

[11:48] <Juerd> Extremely useful. You can easily make it warn and return undef. Finally the user of your module gets to choose in a consistent way :)

[11:49] <ayrnieu> how can you make it warn?

[11:51] <Schwern> use just::a::flesh::wound ?

[11:54] <ayrnieu> Schwern - the other idea was that you can have 'open or die' or else just an 'open' that throws an exception.  Clearly, warnings would reduce the former's utility.

[11:55] <Schwern> Would the caller's "use fatal" change the behavior of an open() inside a subroutine?

[17:35] <rgs> Juerd: fwiw, I won't post on that trollesque thread on hate-software, but I'll have to mention that I *love* the Perl 6 whitespace rules :) even if I'm quite involved in Perl 5.

[17:42] <Juerd> I love that mailing list, even if it is indeed a troll nest.

[17:46] <rgs> yes: http://rgarciasuarez.hates-software.com/

[17:47] <Juerd> Ah :)

[17:52] *** iblechbot joined
[17:56] <TimToady>  rgs: what about the whitespace rules do you like in particular?

[17:57] <rgs> TimToady: it removes ambiguities

[17:58] <rgs> at least for my definition of "intuition"

[17:58] <TimToady> k, I just wasn't sure how I'd answer if someone asked me.  :)

[17:58] <rgs> more specifically, there was a thread on how hateful "print (3+4)" is.

[17:59] <TimToady> ah, yes.  that's something we intentionally killed very dead.

[17:59] <Juerd> I like that it removes the horrible special casing for ().

[17:59] <rgs> Abigail, for example, likes to write that, and patches his perls to remove the warning "print (...) interpreted as a function"

[17:59] <Juerd> rgs: That patch should be default imo :)

[18:00] <rgs> to remove the warning ?

[18:00] <Juerd> Yes, absolutely. I hate that warning.

[18:00] <Juerd> If this is how Perl 5 works, then the warning shouldn't be there.

[18:00] <Juerd> Besides that, the warning appears very inconsistently. Not for every function, not for every amount of whitespace.

[18:00] <rgs> I hate it too. But I still think it helps.

[18:00] <TimToady> Warnings are for when your intuition is violated.

[18:01] <Juerd> And it doesn't respond to no warnings...

[18:01] <rgs> also, this warning is emitted by heuristics

[18:01] <Juerd> TimToady: Warnings are okay if you can disable them. :)

[18:01] <rgs> which is, as you know, a fancy way to say it doesn't work :)

[18:01] <TimToady> Perl 5 tries to change your intuition.  Perl 6 goes with the intuition of 90% of the people.

[18:01] *** wamiks joined
[18:01] <Juerd> I forgot when you got this warning even with no warnings 'syntax';

[18:02] <rgs> I think that's fixed now

[18:02] <Juerd> TimToady: Are there stats on that somewhere?

[18:02] <rgs> but there's a warning that is even more hateful :

[18:02] <rgs> $ perl -we 'my $file; open my $x, $file;'

[18:02] <rgs> Parentheses missing around "my" list at -e line 1.

[18:02] <Juerd> Oh, yes.

[18:02] <rgs> If you remove the ";", the warning goes away.

[18:02] <Juerd> I'm not arguing that this is the most hateful warning :)

[18:03] <rgs> what is hateful is that the tokenizer looks for a ";" to emit the warning. Another heuristic.

[18:03] <TimToady> Juerd: no, 90% is my intuition.  :)

[18:03] <Juerd> TimToady: As mutated by Perl 5, or ...? :)

[18:03] <rgs> stats can be wrong 90% of the time, but not intuition :)

[18:04] <TimToady> anyway, the main reason for the whitespace rules is to keep postfix distinct from infix.

[18:04] <TimToady> this just falls out of it nicely.

[18:04] <TimToady> we had to have a consistent rule or we can't really extend the grammar with new postfix or infix.

[18:05] <Juerd> Uhhuh

[18:05] <Juerd> It took a while for me to realise all this, but I've loved it for quite a while now.

[18:06] <Juerd> I still don't like that you can't use whitespace with . (\ is too ugly for my taste), but understand that there's no fix for that.

[18:06] <TimToady> not without breaking .foo meaning $_.foo

[18:07] <Juerd> Yea

[18:07] <Juerd> Well, there is the backtick of course ;)

[18:07] <Juerd> s/.*//

[18:07] <TimToady> and I think that's also in the same category of doing a small syntax tweak so you don't have to remember a bunch of exceptions.

[18:08] <TimToady> likewise you don't have to remember which } to put ; after.

[18:08] <Juerd> Personally I'd rather be forced to write ; after each }

[18:08] <Juerd> But that's no issue at all for me

[18:09] <Juerd> (It does mean that I have to be more careful about emitting code)

[18:09] <TimToady> yeah

[18:09] <TimToady> but I think the price is worth it in terms of visual clean-lookingness

[18:09] <Juerd> In the past I have emitted code with only \n whitespace.

[18:10] <Juerd> Just because I could ;)

[18:10] <TimToady> which the lack of drives people away from Perl 5

[18:10] <Juerd> I'm not sure what drives people away from Perl 5. The lack of Perl 6 seems to be a big factor too.

[18:10] <TimToady> all the punctuation in Perl 6 has to do work, it can't sit around and loaf.

[18:11] <Juerd> I'm driven away from Perl 5 AND 6 by lack of time to spend typing. :|

[18:11] <Juerd> And the little time I do have, I enjoy discussion too much.

[18:11] <TimToady> I never noticed. :P

[18:12] <Juerd> :)

[18:12] <TimToady> ah well, I agree that the handicap of being only one person is rather depressing at times.

[18:13] <Juerd> I'm vastly wasting my time on this hates-software list now, defending Perl 6 to a bunch of people who have decided that they will hate it anyway...

[18:14] <TimToady> There are lots of people in the world who are never happy unless they have something to be unhappy about.

[18:16] <rgs> and they don't even send patches :)

[18:17] <TimToady> on the other hand, it doesn't do to ignore them entirely either, because occasionally they'll tell you when the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.

[18:18] <Tene> TimToady: can you remember any good examples of times that's happened?

[18:27] <TimToady> well, the people who carped for years about too much gratuitous punctuation in Perl were basically correct.  They were just mostly wrong about which punctuation was gratuitous.

[18:28] <Tene> What were their claims?

[18:28] <TimToady> basically, Perl should look like C.  :)

[18:29] <TimToady> usually in the form of "Perl just looks like line noise."

[18:29] <TimToady> but they wanted mainly to lose the sigils, and the curlies around statements.

[18:29] <TimToady> when we really needed to lose the punctuation variables and the parens around conditionals.

[18:30] <TimToady> and change -> to .

[18:31] *** DHGE joined
[18:31] <TimToady> the sigils and the curlies have only grown in importance

[18:32] <TimToady> curlies are now closures, which is something outside the ken of C programmers.

[18:32] <TimToady> and the sigils turn out to be a good way to hide twigils as well as variable names.

[18:33] <TimToady> so we can use various ascii characters for twigils without disqualifying them as unary prefixes, like happens in Ruby

[18:36] <cognominal>  Will people be allowed to use new sigils as a way to cheaply define their favorite and recurrent types?

[18:37] <TimToady> in theory, yes.  in practice we try to discourage it.

[18:37] <cognominal> why?

[18:38] <TimToady> 'cuz every time we've tried to do that ourselves, we've ended up deciding it's better to just use $.

[18:39] <TimToady> ¢ has been a sigil several times.

[18:39] <cognominal> I would have offered a sigil to Capture for example

[18:39] <TimToady> it had a sigil for a while

[18:41] <cognominal> dutr, more sigils would not be easily accepted outside the Perl communauty

[18:41] <TimToady> but it's basically bad Huffman coding

[18:42] <TimToady> so currently the Capture sigil is |$, kind of.

[18:42] <TimToady> and prefix | composes better with expressions than a ¢ sigil does

[18:43] <TimToady> to use a sigil for a cast, you need parens usually.

[18:43] <TimToady> whereas unary | can be used more places.

[18:43] <TimToady> you'd have to day ¢(function()) instead of |function()

[18:43] <TimToady> *say

[18:44] <TimToady> sigils like to eat following identifiers.

[18:48] <cognominal> Sure enough, even if I do not understand every single choice, I am sold to Perl 6 only thru regex and argument  passing/capture. I can't understand people like Slomi who want to stick with Perl 5.

[18:49] <cognominal> The introduction of references in Perl 5 had stretched the reasonnable syntactic limits

[18:51] <cognominal> hum, Shlomi

[18:52] <cognominal> In French, we say somthing like "Keep me from my friends, my ennemies, I deal with"

[18:55] <TimToady> nah, Shlomi's fine these days, hangs out here frequently.

[19:01] * dmq notes there is a difference between "wants to make perl5 better" and "wants to stick with perl5"
