[01:11] <TimToady> welcome home!

[01:11] <audreyt> just went back to .tw. had a rocky trip with far-too-long transit waiting times (>20hr in total). so will bbl, perhaps quite a bit later. :)

[01:11] <TimToady> crashing is now authorized for the audrey unit.

[01:11] * audreyt watched the movie "superman returns" on the airplane but is feeling totally the opposite...

[01:12] * audreyt crashes &

[01:13] <audreyt> otoh, to think about it, superman also returned by crashing, quite loudly and violently and fierily...

[01:16] <gnuvince> audreyt: feeling totally the opposite?  So you feel like "Subwoman goes away?"  ;-)  I had a question this afternoon, with the number of people having commit access to pugs, has there ever been vandalism?

[01:17] <stevan> gnuvince: never

[01:18] <TimToady> what would be the point?  we have all kinds of backups in and out of svn.

[01:18] <stevan> gnuvince: the occasional broken commit maybe, but nothing intentional

[01:18] *** drbean joined
[01:18] <gnuvince> TimToady: I don't know what the point would be, I'm a good person, I'd never do that.

[01:19] * stevan ponders changing the Pugs startup ASCII art to advertise his favorite prOn site

[01:19] <gnuvince> But I can certainly imagine an imature person thinking s/he's 1337 because he caused problems in the repository

[01:19] <stevan> gnuvince: Pugs really doesnt attract that kind of crowd i think

[01:20] <gnuvince> stevan: I guess not.  Everyone here seems very friendly and open and helpful.

[01:20] <SamB> maybe leaving silly messages in the comments somewhere

[01:20] <gnuvince> So basically, the opposite of comp.lang.lisp ;-)

[08:26] <masak> besides, what happens if several elements are minimal?

[08:27] <masak> is first-match or all of them assigned to?

[08:27] <masak> what happens if no element is minimal?

[08:27] <masak> is there a warning, a run-time error, or nothing?

[08:29] <Alias_> .min = ?

[08:29] <Alias_> How can that possibly work

[08:36] *** Daveman joined
[08:47] <dduncan> ?eval my @a = (1,3,4); my $item = @a.min; say $item;

[08:47] <evalbot_r14742> OUTPUT[1‚ê§] Bool::True

[08:49] <dduncan> afaik, the min and max operators retrive whatever item in the list would be first or last if the list was sorted

[08:49] <dduncan> you were trying the same as this:

[08:49] <dduncan> ?eval 1 = 7;

[08:49] <evalbot_r14742> Error: Can't modify constant item: VInt 1

[08:50] <dduncan> masak, got that?

[08:50] <Alias_> That wouldn't make sense though

[08:50] <Alias_> I would have thought you got a copy/constant of the minimum value

[08:50] <dduncan> yes, so would I

[08:51] <dduncan> but you saw what masak attempted?

[08:51] <Alias_> yeah

[08:56] *** eggzeck_ joined
[08:56] *** eggzeck_ is now known as eggzeck[laptop]

[08:57] <masak> dduncan: got it perfectly

[08:57] <dduncan> okay

[08:57] <masak> but did you see the latest addition to the synopses?

[08:57] <masak> it specs min= and max=

[08:57] <masak> hence the question

[08:57] <dduncan> yes

[08:57] <dduncan> the spec is meant to be used like this:

[08:57] <masak> how _is_ it used

[08:57] <masak> if not like I did?

[08:58] <dduncan> nope

[08:58] <dduncan> like: %item min= @ary;

[08:58] <dduncan> I mean ...

[08:58] <dduncan> like: $item min= @ary;

[08:58] <masak> uh

[08:58] <dduncan> just a minute ...

[08:59] * masak wraps his brain around the example

[08:59] <dduncan> actually, I'm not sure it makes sense ...

[08:59] <masak> it feels quite unperlish

[08:59] <dduncan> its meant to be analagous to $foo += $bar

[08:59] <masak> I thought my usage was analogous

[08:59] *** drrho joined
[08:59] <dduncan> but I'm not sure it actually makes sense

[09:00] <masak> "set the minimum equal to"

[09:00] * masak is presently highly unamused about this new feature

[09:00] <dduncan> since you brought this up, I suggest you reply to p6l and state your confusion with that synopsis change ... and don't mention I talked to you about it

[09:00] <masak> ...and don't mention you talked to me about it

[09:01] <masak> ok

[09:01] * masak does that

[09:01] <dduncan> I just said that since I don't want the list to be confused by our discussion

[09:01] <masak> right

[09:01] <masak> I see

[09:01] <masak> I'll just explain my confusion from my POV

[09:02] <dduncan> the problem is that <foo>= format is I think only normal for binary operators

[09:02] <dduncan> but min, max is a unary operator

[09:02] <masak> you're right

[09:02] <masak> so the analogy is at least not obvious

[09:02] <dduncan> maybe mention that in the email

[09:02] <dduncan> yes

[09:02] <lumi> Is it supposed to be like $a min= 5 # $a = the smaller of $a or 5 ?

[09:03] <dduncan> I'm glad that he added min and max but they don't make sense outside of "min @foo" or @foo.min

[09:04] <masak> lumi: might well be

[09:04] <dduncan> oh, I think I understand ...

[09:04] <masak> your guess is as good as mine

[09:04] <lumi> That's by analogy with +=

[09:04] <lumi> And I think that's what the spec patch seems to say?

[09:04] <dduncan> $foo = $foo min $bar;

[09:04] <dduncan> vs $foo min= $bar;

[09:04] <masak> glad I haven't sent the email yet :)

[09:04] <masak> lumi: this makes much more sense

[09:05] <dduncan> and that would actually be useful, too

[09:05] <masak> ?my $a = 10; $a min= 7; $a

[09:05] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . bf ft id map msg pl v wn

[09:05] <masak> ?eval my $a = 10; $a min= 7; $a

[09:05] <evalbot_r14742> Error: ‚ê§Unexpected "min"‚ê§expecting operator

[09:05] <dduncan> and if min is turned into a reduce operator, it would do what's normal with a list

[09:05] *** Southen joined
[09:05] <masak> dduncan: exactly

[09:05] <dduncan> eg, $item = [min] (1,4,5)

[09:05] <masak> well, my issues with the op just vanished

[09:05] <dduncan> so, no email needed I guess

[09:05] <masak> nope

[17:09] <TimToady> d-line as in "dialup"?

[17:14] <Alias_> As in some type of ban I think

[17:14] <wolverian> sorry, it's a server-specific ban. it was only prison.net that banned feather.

[17:14] <wolverian> (and it's a temporary ban.)

[17:15] <wolverian> (albeit it's 14400 minutes..)

[17:16] <xinming> why will it ban feather over 10 day?

[17:16] <TimToady> maybe they like python?

[17:17] <wolverian> because of "clones", i.e. too many people connected from the same host (feather) at the same time.

[17:17] <gnuvince> People still go on efnet?

[17:26] <PerlJam> gnuvince: yes.

[17:26] <PerlJam> that's a lame ban

[17:35] <cognominal> does unicode whitespace include \n and \r?

[17:38] <cognominal> ?eval  say  "\n" ~~ m/\s/

[17:44] <gnuvince> ?eval my ($a, undef, $b) = 1..3; "$a $b"

[17:44] <gnuvince> No evalbot?

[17:44] <wolverian> ENOEVALBOT

[17:44] <gnuvince> Hmmm

[17:44] <eviltwin_b> not my fault this time :)

[17:44] <gnuvince> Does anyone know if the above should be supported? run.pugscode.org reports an error

[17:46] <TimToady> doesn't matter whether unicode considers \n to be whitespace, since \s is Perl whitespace, not Unicode whitespace :)

[17:47] <eviltwin_b> which?  IIRC the undef syntax is a perl5-ism

[17:48] <TimToady> assignment to undef is not supported.  I believe assignment to * is, though

[17:48] *** andara left
[17:49] <eviltwin_b> yeh, that's the new one IIRC.  was just poking at synopses to trey to recall what it was

[17:49] <gnuvince> TimToady: doesn't work either....

[17:49] <TimToady> though I think it's unimpl

[17:49] <gnuvince> Ah

[17:49] * gnuvince checks the tests

[17:49] <gaal> TimToady: wouldn't you need a sigil trace there? my ($x, $, $y)

[17:50] <gaal> because otherwise there's a potential multi dispatch ambiguity

[17:50] <TimToady> that should also work

[17:50] <gaal> (no reason i can see not to also allow *, at the users's discretion)

[17:50] <gnuvince> if * is whatever or infinity, I imagine my ($a, *) = 1..3; would work, but not my ($a, *, $b)

[17:51] <TimToady> * is not infinity, despite what the error message indicates

[17:51] <TimToady> "whateverness" is not yet properly implemented either, I think.

[17:51] <Alias_> Just "mostly" infinite? :)

[17:51] <eviltwin_b> in that context I'd expect it to matcha  single item which could be anything

[17:52] <gnuvince> Well so far, I can't find what to put between $a and $b.  Have failed: ($a, undef, $b), ($a, *, $b), ($a, $, $b)

[17:52] <eviltwin_b> it's much closer to "whatever" than "infinity" in intent

[17:52] <eviltwin_b> it's nmot implemented yet, so presumably you need a dummy var for now

[17:52] <PerlJam> gnuvince: now's the time to patch pugs  :-)

[17:53] <gnuvince> PerlJam: I'll need to skim the synopses tonight to see if the syntax is mentionned.

[17:53] <TimToady> yeah, you could probably sneak in a lot of stuff while audreyt is in thudstate.

[17:53] <gnuvince> heheh

[17:53] <PerlJam> gnuvince: ($a,undef,$b) is invalid I think, but the other two should be fine.

[17:54] * gnuvince would need to brush up on his haskell

[17:54] <PerlJam> gnuvince: implement it even if it's not in a synopsis.  Maybe that'll cause someone to document it :)

[17:54] <TimToady> people who succeed in brushing up on haskell do so by brushing up lazily.

[17:55] <gnuvince> meh, no haskell-mode at $work :(

[17:55] <PerlJam> TimToady: indeed!  Early on in pugs development, I implemented looping constructs in pugs while knowing very little haskell.

[17:57] <PerlJam> (lazy learning)++

[17:57] <avar> anyone have the correct emacs settings for editing p5/p6 code in the pugs repos without screwing up the indenting?

[17:59] <gnuvince> avar: well I got something that seems reasonable

[21:40] <TimToady> I want: "Here's a chunk of code; tell me about it."

[21:40] <avar> example?

[21:41] <TimToady> $a min= $b

[21:42] <TimToady> "this assigns $b to $a if and only if $b is less than $a--see http://foo.bar.baz"

[21:43] <avar> Is that really p6doc(1) domain? sounds more like some deparse module

[21:43] <avar> B::English?:)

[21:43] <TimToady> anyway, I think we want to aim for something more like a google search, where the keywords are naturally generated from the documentation, and not just the particular keywords the writer of perldoc happened to think of.

[21:44] <TimToady> you want to be able to search for "min="

[21:44] <TimToady> or "[*]"

[21:45] <TimToady> or "-S"

[21:45] <TimToady> or "^..^"

[21:46] <TimToady> I think we could a lot better with questions of the form "What the heck does X mean?"

[21:46] <TimToady> without forcing people to supersearch PerlMonks

[21:47] <PerlJam> p6doc shouldn't require switches like -f or -q

[21:47] <avar> hrm, more metadata support in the POD syntax would make that easier

[21:47] <TimToady> p6explain '[min=]'

[21:48] *** justatheory joined
[21:48] <TimToady> even if an explainer can't decipher the whole thing, it can break it into bits and link to various bits of documentation

[21:49] <TimToady> and if it can recognize the whole thing, it should proceed to explain it right then and there

[21:49] <[particle]> indexing would be a start

[21:51] <PerlJam> p6explain will be uebersmart :)

[21:53] <TimToady> needs a shorter name though

[21:54] <TimToady> p6ex maybe

[21:54] <TimToady> "Everything you always wanted to know about 6ex but were afraied to ask..."

[21:54] <TimToady> *afraid

[21:54] <avar> hihi

[21:55] <TimToady> sx

[21:55] <TimToady> six

[21:56] <TimToady> sax and sox are taken...

[21:56] <PerlJam> splain

[21:56] <PerlJam> 6plain

[21:56] <PerlJam> p6e

[21:56] <[particle]> 6fancy

[21:56] <TimToady> kinda like 6plain

[21:56] <[particle]> me too

[21:57] <[particle]> lucy, lemme 6plain!

[21:57] <PerlJam> it's your bikeshed, I'm just suggesting colors  ;)

[21:58] <TimToady> plex

[21:58] <PerlJam> pex  (for damian ;-)

[21:58] <TimToady> "Please explain"

[21:59] <TimToady> make it so that plex will try to explain anything, but it just happens to specialize in Perl 6.  :)

[21:59] * avar forsees having to reach for the numrow to use perl6-anything

[22:00] <TimToady> yeah, I was in 6 avoidance mode when I suggested plex

[22:00] <TimToady> also short for Perl lexer

[22:01] <avar> a pexer:)

[22:02] <obra> seen audreyt

[22:02] <PerlJam> plex also has the nice benefit that it shares 3/4 of its letters with perl

[22:07] <TimToady> and ends the same as "index"

[22:08] <[particle]> expl has similar characteristics

[22:08] <PerlJam> sans the index-ending

[22:08] <TimToady> expl deleted

[22:08] <[particle]> no, it begins like explain

[22:09] <TimToady> but how do you pronounce it?

[22:09] <avar> eksple

[22:09] <PerlJam> expl leaves a expectant sound at the end

[22:10] <PerlJam> s/a /an /

[22:10] <TimToady> too much like expr, maybe

[22:10] <[particle]> i always thought of perl as a left-handed language

[22:10] <[particle]> expr =~ y/r/l/

[22:11] <PerlJam> [particle]: are you saying perl is like thalidomide?

[22:11] <TimToady> plex for when you're perplexed by something complex

[22:11] <[particle]> perl is complex?

[22:11] <TimToady> in spots

[22:11] <[particle]> whoa, you think if that were true, the designer would have told us to be careful....

[22:13] *** Limbic_Region joined
[22:13] <PerlJam> but what is perl's charge and spin?

[22:14] <TimToady> there's no charge for Perl

[22:14] <TimToady> we have lots of spin though

[22:14] <[particle]> 3/2

[22:14] <TimToady> maybe it's a graviton

[22:14] <TimToady> it sucks everything else in like a black hole...

[22:15] <[particle]> the internals of perl5 are like a black hole...

[22:15] <PerlJam> What's its chirality?

[22:16] <TimToady> definitely biased towards spearmint over carraway

[22:16] <avar> [particle]: you think p6 will be different?

[22:16] <PerlJam> avar: it had better be different!

[22:16] <[particle]> avar: i'm inside the event horizon on that one

[22:17] <[particle]> or perhaps i'm beyond it

[22:17] <[particle]> where are you?

[22:17] <avar> huh?

[22:17] <PerlJam> I haven't been paying attention to p5p in a long while, but is there any overlap in p5 developers and p6 developers?

[22:17] <TimToady> he means "when are you?"

[22:17] <TimToady> event horizons do that to you

[22:18] <TimToady> a little--each side has its spies on the other side...

[22:18] * avar still has no idea what the question is;/

[22:20] <chip> speak into my wristwatch

[22:20] <TimToady> open channel D

[22:20] <PerlJam> avar: you have to squint, cock your head to one side and look sideways through space-time

[22:21] <TimToady> avar: that's the basic problem in a nutshell--you have to design a computer language without knowing either the answers or the questions.

[22:22] <[particle]> avar: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon

[22:23] <TimToady> which is what plex will point you to if it has now idea how to explain something

[22:23] <TimToady> s/now/no/

[22:23] <[particle]> :)

[22:23] <PerlJam> What was the name of that computer in HHGTTG?

[22:23] <PerlJam> the one that gave 42 as the answer

[22:24] *** sweinig|away is now known as sweinig

[22:24] <[particle]> Deep Thought

[22:25] <PerlJam> oh, of course

[22:25] <PerlJam> (I was thinking that but also thinking that I must be conflating it with some IBM computer ;-)

[22:29] <TimToady> I have an IBM computer right now, but I've never seen it conflate.

[22:29] *** larsen_ joined
[22:30] <TimToady> though I understand some of them have been known to conflagrate.

[22:31] <PerlJam> some even confabulate

[22:32] <PerlJam> some police districts use them to confiscate

[22:33] <PerlJam> But mostly computers just consternate

[22:34] <PerlJam> (at one per minute it's going to take a while to get through all of the con.*ate words  :-)

[22:35] <PerlJam> oh and for last minute's word ...

[22:35] <PerlJam> but what do you expect from a big conglomerate

[22:35] <TimToady> you need to be more considerate

[22:38] <PerlJam> :-)

[22:40] <PerlJam> not to mention that messing with perl5 internals gives cause to contra-indicate

[22:41] <PerlJam> But I don't mean to constipate

[23:49] <justatheory> Will I be able to overload &&, ||, !, and, or, and not in Perl 6?

[23:50] <[particle]> yes

[23:51] <[particle]> multi prefix:<!> { ... }

[23:53] <justatheory> Rockin!

[23:53] <justatheory> Can't do it in Perl 5 or Ruby, so I was hoping‚Ä¶

[23:54] <[particle]> you can do it already with pugs :)

[23:54] <Alias_> You can get rid of ALL the operators and start from scratch!

[23:57] <[particle]> Alias_: how's pita coming?

[23:57] <Alias_> uh, again?

[23:57] <Alias_> oh right, stupid network

[23:57] <Alias_> [particle]> how's PITA coming along? chip asked about smoking parrot today

[23:57] <Alias_> Alias_> The problem of integration into CPAN has been solved

[23:57] <Alias_> <Alias_> The POE rewrite of the image manager has a new volunteer on it

[23:58] <Alias_> <Alias_> And we have some initial test images released

[23:58] <Alias_> <Alias_> So pretty close to having the core working now

[23:58] <Alias_> <Alias_> From there it's all downhill

[23:58] <Alias_> :)

[23:59] <[particle]> fab! where are announcements made?
