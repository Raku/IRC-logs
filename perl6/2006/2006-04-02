[00:23] <TimToady> audreyt: earlier we specified that :arg<1> and :arg<2> should prefer the first to the second, on the theory that defaults always go later in the list (esp %args).  I still think we should maybe provide an ordered list of nameds so we can map unix command line.

[00:25] <TimToady> So I think maybe nameds should come in as a list and merely be memoized as a hash, or something.

[00:26] <TimToady> I'm also regretting making "multi" default to "multi method" inside classes.  I think we should be encouraging people to write multi subs most of the time, plus I think having to remember the context is a --.

[00:38] <theorbtwo> Did you notice the PM one?

[00:38] <TimToady> In other words, named args should do both list and hash roles, and compiler can optimize to real hash with list emul on no dups, otherwise list rep with hash emul, but the user doesn't care.

[00:40] <TimToady> which PM one, the mutually assured destruction, or Weird Al playing Larry Wall?

[00:41] <theorbtwo> I assume you caught the second one, since you star in it.  I don't know what you mean by the first one... is there one I missed?

[00:41] <theorbtwo> I meant the gender-bending.

[00:42] <TimToady> Yeah, I noticed it, but wrote it off a thinko.  April fools on me.

[00:43] <TimToady> The catalyst vs jifty MAD.

[00:45] <theorbtwo> Yeah, it's a bit on the subtle side.

[00:46] <theorbtwo> Except in the CB, words would change gender.  Sadly, I forgot about the CB's caching.

[01:05] <lichtkind> hello perl 6 people i started in our perl forum some perl 6 discussion and it turn out that some people are worried about the new assignment operator := can you still make references the old way?

[01:05] <TimToady> audreyt: or maybe more like Match objects autogenerate arrays on multiplicity, multiple args of the same name could generate a list that we usually only take the first value off of.  That is, arrays whose scalar value is the first element.

[01:06] <TimToady> lichtkind: it will still work very much like a Perl 5 programmer would expect.  It's just the internal representation of \$x that is unified with \($x, $y, $z) which is an argument list.

[01:07] <TimToady> but you can still say $y = \$x to get a level of indirection that you undo with $$y.

[01:08] <lichtkind> thanks but im not native speaker i dont understood last part of your first answer

[01:08] <lichtkind> what means unified with \($x, $y, $z)

[01:09] <TimToady> It means that \$x is really just an argument list with one argument, but it behaves like a reference.

[01:10] <theorbtwo> lichtkind: To just answer your questions: yes, you can make a reference like in perl 5.

[01:12] <TimToady> It's just that in Perl 6 it is a smarter mechanism underneath.

[01:12] <TimToady> so you can make references of things you can't make references of in Perl 5.

[01:12] <lichtkind> sounds cool

[01:12] <TimToady> like a set of arguments to a function, without actually calling the function.

[01:12] <lichtkind> but filehandles are now objects anyway

[01:13] <TimToady> we hope so.

[01:13] <TimToady> yes, filehandles are objects now.

[01:15] <lichtkind> the second thing i long time ago wanted ask in an perl channel is: the wikipedia perl article is pretty a mess would some native speaker help me to trnslate the german into english, i spent several month to make this perl article real good and structured

[01:15] <TimToady> audreyt: so if bound to a scalar, you get first :arg<1>, but if bound to a list, you get all *arg params.

[01:16] <TimToady> Ich spreche kein Deutsch...er...

[01:16] <Juerd> lichtkind: I'm neither native English nor native German, but I could help you if you want.

[01:16] <lichtkind> ahhh juerd we know each other from bochum

[01:16] * Juerd spricht auch kein Deutsch, aber kann es wohl lesen.

[01:16] <Juerd> lichtkind: Wirklich?

[01:16] <Juerd> lichtkind: Who are you then? :)

[01:16] <lichtkind> yes darling we slept together :)

[01:17] <Juerd> lichtkind: I'm quite sure that even in German that's dubious.

[01:17] <Juerd> lichtkind: Who are you? :)

[01:17] <lichtkind> the editor guy

[01:17] <Juerd> Editor, as in pce?

[01:17] <lichtkind> yes thats my pet

[01:17] <Juerd> Ah, then I know who you are. Hi :)

[01:18] <lichtkind> german is my native tongue but english is sometimes troublesome for me

[01:18] <Juerd> So I've experienced

[01:18] <lichtkind> pce its about to be renamed

[01:18] <TimToady> English is my native tongue and I have trouble with it.

[01:19] <Juerd> English isn't my native tongue, and I absolutely hate the languge

[01:19] <Juerd> language

[01:19] <Juerd> But alas, it's the current latin french language.

[01:19] <lichtkind> its only that i can get help to be shure its a good english

[01:20] <Juerd> I see

[01:20] <lichtkind> but now i have other wiki tasks to solve in our board wiki

[01:20] <lichtkind> im writing some perl 6 quick reference to get some of our people interested

[01:20] <lichtkind> but after that ...

[01:21] <lichtkind> Juerd we share pretty the same view on perl 6

[01:22] <Juerd> lichtkind: Really, are you also confronted with a mixture of extreme fear and bizarre enthousiastic anticipation?

[01:22] <theorbtwo> Wow, I like that term.

[01:22] <theorbtwo> "enthousiastic anticipation", that is.

[01:23] <lichtkind> im too religious to have much but fear but yes i see the possibility of gigantic failure

[01:23] <lichtkind> that scares me too

[01:24] <lichtkind> im positive because i believe that the design principles of perl come close to the fundamental rules of life

[01:24] <lichtkind> and when that failes that is signal that people are in bad shape

[01:25] <lichtkind> or bad people drive perl 6 :)

[01:25] <Juerd> theorbtwo: % spelling

[01:26] <lichtkind> juerd do you can understand me?

[01:26] <TimToady> but my theology says everyone is born bad anyway, so we try to take that into account. :)

[01:27] <lichtkind> but basicly i use perl because i feels good

[01:27] <lichtkind> thatswhy i love it

[01:27] <lichtkind> it simple dont have to fail

[01:27] <lichtkind> :)

[01:28] <TimToady> I think even if Perl 6 fails it will still feel good to use.

[01:28] <TimToady> In that sense, Perl 5 is already an example of a good failure.

[01:29] <theorbtwo> I wouldn't expect perl 5 and 6 to fail in the same ways.

[01:29] <TimToady> Maybe it will feel better, and also fail better. :)

[01:30] <TimToady> As in "Q: How's you're cold doing? A: It's doing fine."

[01:31] <Juerd> lichtkind: Partly.

[01:32] <Juerd> I should go to bed

[01:32] <lichtkind> me too

[01:32] * theorbtwo should as well, and it's an hour later were Juerd is.

[01:32] <Juerd> (3:32 am)

[01:32] <Juerd> Good night or localtime of your preference, everyone.

[01:32] <Juerd> zzZ

[01:32] <lichtkind> i liked the moment juerd said please believe in perl 6 tight with the right atitude

[01:32] <Juerd> Perl 6 tight? :)

[01:33] <Juerd> We still call it strict.

[01:33] <Juerd> Anyway, afk

[01:33] <lichtkind> i ment right

[01:33] <lichtkind> ok good night

[01:33] <lichtkind> here is 3:33 too

[01:38] <lichtkind> but is it really the case that religious sounding program names scares people away?

[05:25] <arcady> any chance of getting Pugs.AST.Internals to compile faster? that one file is like half the total build time...

[05:30] <gaal> audreyt: whee :)

[05:31] <gaal> I gotta say it's still weird how Perl has sigils everywhere except arguments

[05:31] <gaal> is this valid? sub foo ($bar, @bar)

[05:31] <svnbot6> r9816 | audreyt++ | * I've got a new email address, [email@hidden.address]
[05:32] <gaal> you golfed your email address!

[05:32] <audreyt> right!

[05:32] <audreyt> arcady: yes :)

[05:33] <audreyt> gaal: they are sugar for

[05:33] * gaal remembers guiltily the CompUnit data type he'd added but not put to use

[05:33] <audreyt> :bar($bar) :bar(@bar)

[05:34] <audreyt> which ought to be an error, or just take the @bar side

[05:34] <audreyt> I'm in favour of an error.

[05:34] <gaal> audreyt: what does :bar<42> do then?

[05:34] <arcady> audreyt: yes as in it takes forever to compile, or yes as in it will be fixed? : )

[05:34] <gaal> ah

[05:34] <audreyt> arcady: to both

[05:35] <gaal> okay, worse: sub foo ($bar?, @bar?)

[05:36] <audreyt> gaal: because all positionals are implicitly bindable with name

[05:36] <audreyt> (if they have a name)

[05:36] <audreyt> (otherwise it's gensym'ed or something)

[05:36] <audreyt> I don't think it's possible to reuse names for them

[05:37] <audreyt> getopt spec doesn't let you do that either, right?

[05:37] <gaal> it doesn't

[05:37] <gaal> but that isn't typed anyway.

[05:38] <gaal> it's kind of a letdown to pretend sigils create totally different namespaces for variables everywhere in the language and then have a place where you can't have $bar and @bar.

[05:40] <audreyt> sub foo ( @bar( [$bar, *@] ) ) { ... }

[05:40] <audreyt> a_bar@(s_bar:_)

[05:40] <audreyt> that is legal

[05:40] <audreyt> because you can't touch s_bar by hand

[05:40] <audreyt> s/hand/name/

[05:41] <gaal> can't touch it?

[05:41] <audreyt> foo(bar=>1)

[05:41] <audreyt> always goes into @bar not $bar

[05:41] <audreyt> because $bar is unside an unpacker

[05:42] <audreyt> (then $bar gets bound to the first element of @bar)

[05:42] <gaal> ah, from the caller side. I see

[05:43] <gaal> [OT] when does summer time kick in in the states?

[05:43] <audreyt> today?

[19:08] <nothing_pasta> hi people

[19:08] <nothing_pasta> FYI: my laptop died

[19:09] <nothing_pasta> even fewer TUITs i guess

[19:09] <nothing_pasta> hope it comes back, and see you till then

[19:10] * Limbic_Region doesn't think he has ever prayed for an inanimate object before but will make this a first

[19:12] <nothing_pasta> thanks =)

[19:12] <nothing_pasta> it's surely inanimate right now ;-)

[19:12] <nothing_pasta> i doubt it'll help though, i'm sure it's a curse

[19:13] <nothing_pasta> the last time something happenned was when I was working on the Catalyst screen casts

[19:13] <nothing_pasta> i stopped because i had to recover my disk

[19:13] <nothing_pasta> today i started working on the script again

[19:13] <nothing_pasta> and BLAM

[19:13] <nothing_pasta> it died

[19:13] <Juerd> nothing_pasta: What died?

[19:13] *** Barry joined
[19:13] <Juerd> nothing_pasta: Just the disk, or more?

[19:14] <nothing_pasta> Juerd: the logic board prolly

[19:14] <nothing_pasta> it's not booting

[19:14] <nothing_pasta> one sec

[19:15] <nothing_pasta> http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=303235

[19:15] <nothing_pasta> i posted to the bottom

[19:15] <nothing_pasta> i hope they give me a shiny new one ;-)

[19:15] <Juerd> Oh, hurray. Applebreakage

[19:16] <nothing_pasta> aye =(

[19:16] * Juerd reads way too much about [i|Power]Books breaking to even consider getting one.

[19:16] <Juerd> They have the best sleep/resume functionality of all laptops, but there ends the fun

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> i actually had very good experiences up till now

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> the last time it was a software problem

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> and that was resolved without icky reformats and what not

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> and my previous laptop tokk on hell of a beating before dying

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> and my mother's ibook is still alive

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> despite the crashed disk

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> back in the day she would use it for 6 hours

[19:17] <nothing_pasta> then I would use it for 10

[19:18] <nothing_pasta> now my aunt uses it

[19:18] <Juerd> Sure, everyone's experience is different

[19:18] *** Barry left
[19:18] <Juerd> But I do still believe thinkpads are the best.

[19:18] <Juerd> I don't have *some* experience with them, but lots.

[19:19] <Juerd> Lenovo is doing good things, that make me trust them as much as I trusted IBM with the series.

[19:20] <Juerd> They changed a few things in the designs that I don't like, but can understand.

[19:21] <Juerd> nothing_pasta: Did you make backups?

[19:25] <nothing_pasta> Juerd: anything important is in revision control

[19:25] <nothing_pasta> except one big bang thing that's in my working dir

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> and that I should have made a branch for

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> and would have made a branch for if i was using darcs =)

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> all my music (very important) is burned to DVDs

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> except some stuff from emusic

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> that I can download again

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> my prefs and stuff are all throwaway

[19:26] <nothing_pasta> anything valuable is on pasta

[19:27] *** tri joined
[19:27] <nothing_pasta> and I suspect that the disk is OK

[19:29] *** ezraburgh joined
[19:30] <nothing_pasta> anyway, i'm off

[19:30] <nothing_pasta> see you

[19:30] <nothing_pasta> thanks for the support, Limbic_Region, Juerd

[19:39] <svnbot6> r9820 | fglock++ | PCR - added '$'; added 'grammar.pl' - an extensible p6 grammar

[19:41] *** justatheory joined
[19:43] *** fglock joined
[19:55] <fglock> I'm confused with operators x methods - is there a single precedence table for all multimethods in all classes?

[19:57] <pmurias> hi fglock

[19:58] <fglock> pmurias: hi!

[19:58] <fglock> pmurias: I'm starting to rewrite lrep...

[19:59] <pmurias> the lrep-compiler or the legacy one?

[19:59] <fglock> It will be Pugs::Compiler::Perl6 if it works

[20:00] <fglock> the prototype if PCR/grammar.pl

[20:00] <pmurias> seen the commit now

[20:00] <fglock> s/if/is/

[20:01] <pmurias> have you seen my commit, could you check if &rule is defined right

[20:01] <pmurias> ?

[20:01] <fglock> I need to find out about precedence of methods - like Int.infix:<+> and infix:<+> - are these the same?

[20:02] <fglock> pmurias: which file?

[20:04] <pmurias> lrep-compiler/Runtime/RuleCompiler.pm

[20:06] *** larsen_ joined
[20:08] <fglock> pmurias: you are using some undocumented subs - it may break (or not) if PCR changes

[20:11] <pmurias> fglock: it was broken from the start i mearly refactored it, basicly it only works for simple cases (see the test) and brakes for Grammar/Perl6.pm

[20:11] <pmurias> i would be gratefull if you showed me what the proper(offical) way to do it is

[20:13] <fglock> looking

[20:16] *** ezraburgh joined
[20:17] <fglock> the basic API is: my $rule = Pugs::Compiler::Rule->compile( 'a' ); my $match = $rule->match( $str );

[20:17] *** lisppaste3 joined
[20:17] *** ezraburgh left
[20:17] *** ezraburgh joined
[20:18] <fglock> or: *rule = Pugs::Compiler::Rule->compile( 'a' )->code; my $match = main->rule( $str );

[20:18] *** lisppaste3 joined
[20:18] <fglock> $rule->perl5 returns the p5 source code for the object

[20:20] <fglock> PCR t/04-rule.t covers the most common use cases

[20:22] <pmurias> thanks, i'll abandon ruoso's precompiling scheme for now and see if it works using the official api

[20:22] <fglock> you can precompile using the perl5 method

[20:23] <fglock> my $src = Pugs::Compiler::Rule->compile( 'a' )->perl5; $rule = eval $src;

[20:24] <fglock> *rule = ( eval $src )->code;  # untested

[20:28] <fglock> *rule = $rule->code;

[20:32] <svnbot6> r9821 | pmurias++ | the version without the precompile

[20:32] <pmurias> fglock: if I use the offical api the same bug strikes again

[20:33] <fglock> how can I test it?

[20:34] *** Dazhbog left
[20:35] <pmurias> just run lrep -i test-file -o out

[20:36] <pmurias> substitute test-file by any p6 from t/,the resault is the same error

[20:38] <fglock> installing Perl6::Slurp ...

[20:47] *** hlen joined
[20:49] *** justatheory joined
[20:52] <fglock> pmurias: I get "Can't use string ("0") as a HASH ref while "strict refs" in use at .../site/lib/Pugs/Compiler/Rule.pm line 56, <GEN0> line 1." - this means $rule->match is being called with extra parameters

[20:56] *** ezraburgh joined
[20:57] *** justatheory joined
[20:58] <pmurias> figured it out during painfull debugging, 0's can't autovindicate, but where does the extra parameter come from?

[21:05] <pmurias> fglock:after reading S1{2,3} i don't think Int.<+> is allowed, <+> is propably sub dispatched

[21:10] <fglock> a caller() just before the error says: Grammar/Perl6.pm 2518

[21:11] <fglock> I mean: 1+1 vs 1.0+1.0 - do they always have the same precedence?

[21:13] <pmurias> it would be horribly inconsistent if they didn't

[21:13] *** FurnaceBoy joined
[21:14] <pmurias> i need to go to sleep now, so i'll check the S** tommorow

[21:15] * pmurias always backlogs by the way, so feel free to ask me while i'm sleeping
