[00:00] <dduncan> but I'll say quickly ... the basis for what I'm mentioning is that we have a Relation, which is a role, that can be implemented either in memory or as a tied object with a db backend; but, if you use several together or do multiple actions on one, they can be rearranged into different actions behind the scenes that are more efficient

[00:01] <dduncan> I will not be at YAPC, regrettably

[00:01] <dduncan> can't afford it

[00:01] <dduncan> the rearranging is the optimizer

[00:01] <dduncan> they still work otherwise, but slower

[00:01] <dduncan> if not the optimizer, then an elaborate macro

[00:02] <nothingmuch> aye

[00:02] <nothingmuch> IMHO macros-for-performance is a bad tradeoff

[00:02] <nothingmuch> annotations for performance, otoh

[00:02] <nothingmuch> give you both documentation

[00:02] <nothingmuch> and speed

[00:02] <nothingmuch> (and safety, if they're the good kind)

[00:02] <dduncan> either way, I want to be able to implement that functionality in plain Perl 6, aside from the bare minimum of low level bindings

[00:02] <dduncan> eg, write the optimizer in Perl 6

[00:03] <nothingmuch> i think it's still in the distant fugture

[00:03] <nothingmuch> but the compiler toolchain will be in perl 6

[00:03] <nothingmuch> so the plugins for the optimizer can be perl 6 too

[00:04] <dduncan> meanwhile, I will implement the non-optimized version that looks the same to users, but is slower, doing most work at the perl end

[00:04] <nothingmuch> audreyt: when should i release .46? ~10 PASSes?

[00:04] <obra> nothingmuch: should I test the snap against jifty?

[00:05] <dduncan> once this is done ... no more SQL ... you write your queries in natural perl 6, with things that look like standard Perl functions like maps and greps and junctions and sets, as if each database table was an in-memory array or something ... that's my goal

[00:05] <nothingmuch> obra: please do

[00:05] <obra> url?

[00:06] <nothingmuch> http://pause.perl.org/incoming/YAML-Syck-0.46_01.tar.gz

[00:07] <obra> t/2-scalars...........ok 1/39Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at (eval 6) line 1.

[00:08] <obra> "not a big deal"

[00:08] <obra> but still

[00:08] <audreyt> nothingmuch: release it when we get f2f bandwidth

[00:09] <nothingmuch> f2f?

[00:09] <audreyt> face 2 face

[00:09] <nothingmuch> ah

[01:29] <colomon>  (1 subtest UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED) (1150 subtests TODO), 1497 subtests skipped.

[01:45] <dduncan> I finished smoking pre1 ... shows a bunch of errors

[01:45] <dduncan> see http://m19s28.vlinux.de/iblech/stuff/pugs-smokes/pugs-smoke-6.2.12-r0-darwin-normal--1151199462-8264--11531-11495-36-1322-1734-1--bfd1d18082919a15c1cd39e3c76e55c0.html

[01:47] <dduncan> all the problems seem to be related to t/pugsrun/07-dash-uppercase-v.t just cutting out a quarter of the way through, with the other red squares saying 'stub'

[01:47] <dduncan> I will run that test by itself now ...

[01:50] <dduncan> run in isolation, at about test 13, it dies with the message "Bus error", whatever that means

[01:52] <dduncan> I will nopaste a crash report now ...

[01:54] <pasteling> "dduncan" at 24.69.53.198 pasted "crash report for ./pugs t/pugsrun/07-dash-uppercase-v.t ... may be due to memory corruption from local dirty power, though" (70 lines, 3.6K) at http://sial.org/pbot/17950

[01:54] <dduncan> make of that what you will

[01:54] <dduncan> I get nearly the same result with multiple runs

[01:55] <dduncan> if it is corrupted system memory from local dirty power, I'll see if a restart fixes it ...

[01:58] <dduncan> that did it

[01:58] <dduncan> all tests pass

[01:59] <dduncan> I think I need to prioritize the purchase of a power conditioner

[02:00] <dduncan> so ignoring all that, we would seem to have no test fails, and one unexpected success, with pre1
