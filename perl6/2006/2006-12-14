[06:23] <froggero1> anyone know anything about hmac md5?

[06:25] <gaal> @tell fridim try the latest pugs from the source at http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/

[06:25] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[06:25] <froggero1> bascially, I took the javascript hmac md5 script from http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5 (md5.js) and the values that it's returning compared to http://backpan.cpan.org/authors/Clinton_Wong/ 's hmac::md5 module don't match up

[06:26] <froggero1> can't figure out why... I have a random key that gets generated, and used in the hex, and that's getting transferred the same... putting it in the same order, supposed to be using the same protocol... maybe one of them is out or something? 

[06:27] <gaal> froggero1: I don't have time to look at this myself right now, but one lead is to make sure there isn't some bogus unicode conversion going on

[06:27] <froggero1> good idea... I know the java is in ascii, will check the mod

[06:28] <froggero1> not much in the readme... http://backpan.cpan.org/authors/Clinton_Wong/HMAC-MD5-0.02.readme

[06:28] <froggero1> love it

[06:29] <froggero1> in the perdoc:

[06:29] <froggero1> SYNOPSIS

[06:29] <froggero1>         use HMAC::MD5;

[06:29] <froggero1>         hex($string, $key) returns a 16 byte digest in binary form.

[06:29] <froggero1>         hexhash($string, $key) returns a 16 byte digest as printable hex.

[06:29] <gaal> Try out Digest-MD5

[06:30] <froggero1> the javascript uses hmac though

[06:31] <froggero1> the front end for this is a website... which is in perl, but i'm using javascript to turn the form input values into a md5 hash based on the password and a random key.. unless there's a better way to do this (i don't know enough about javascripting at the moment)

[06:32] <froggero1> i tried digest-md5 but the values were out as well.. that's what led me to hmac in the first place

[16:42] <fglock> kolibrie: MP6 is much more stable than v6, because it depends on no external modules. It's also fully tested, as it depends on itself for compiling

[16:52] <fglock> nwc10: the current implementation wraps the core subs, so that it can control the parameters/dispatch

[16:53] <gaal> maybe a switch to mean "there are no barewords here, everything's a function

[16:53] <gaal> "?

[16:53] <nwc10> I don't know. Asking questions of me isn't necessarily a help here.

[17:18] <fridim> nice bot

[17:28] <TimToady>  nwc10: if I was going to add something like that, I'd generalize it slightly to a lexically scoped macro mechanism on about the level of C macros.  That would give you much of the power of source filtering without most of the problems.

[17:29] <nwc10> TimToady: ah OK. I was thinking more in terms of "what can't 6-on-5 do well"

[17:34] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - perl 5 question.  Do you know why goto $code_ref; behaves as if you said goto &$code_ref; but performs way better?

[17:36] *** buetow joined
[17:37] <TimToady> no, I don't.  I didn't add that functionality.

[17:37] <TimToady> I wonder if it bypasses the code that strips the old @_ off and shoves the new one onto the stack...

[17:38] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - that's the part I was wondering about too

[17:38] <TimToady> might be someone was trying to make tail recursion faster.

[18:36] <jdv79> about the $^ sigiled vars - where does the rest of the var name come from?

[18:37] <TimToady> Limbic_Region: actually, nwc10 is on the right track, I think.  the &$foo has to throw in an extra opcode to possibly translate a symref to a CV.  bare $foo bypasses that.

[18:37] <TimToady> jdv79: "come from"?

[18:38] *** rindolf joined
[18:38] <TimToady> in my experience, the rest of the var name comes from typing more characters after the ^.  :P

[18:39] <rindolf> Hi all.

[18:39] <TimToady> hi

[18:40] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - I think it is underdocumented regardless.

[18:41] <Limbic_Region> but then again, I think the behavior of glob iterator is underdocumented too

[18:41] <jdv79> i'm ust reading j worthington's p6 oo presentation and he shows "$^n" but I don't get where the n part came from.

[18:41] <TimToady> I still don't know what you mean by "came from"

[18:41] <wolverian> I think he means it's not declared.

[18:41] <wolverian> or rather, that is confusing him.

[18:42] <TimToady> $^n is self-declaring, jdv79

[18:42] <TimToady> many twigiled variables are self-declaring.

[18:42] <TimToady> $*n is a self-declared global, for instance.

[18:43] <TimToady> but the twigil tells it the scope.

[18:43] <jdv79> oh ok.  is there a central doc on all the twigil variations?

[18:43] <TimToady> so with ^ it happens to be a parameter to the current block.

[18:43] <TimToady> sure

[18:43] <Limbic_Region> jdv79 - they are the new $a and $b

[18:43] <Limbic_Region> jdv79 - they are the new $a and $b

[18:55] <TimToady> jdv79: in addition to being the new $a and $b, the ^ notation also lets you document the meaning of the single argument to a single-argument block where in Perl 5 you'd have to use $_

[18:59] <lambdabot> Title: ikegami's scratchpad

[18:59] <Limbic_Region> looks like more than just 1 extra op

[19:01] <TimToady> wow, looks like refgen thought it needed to boil down a list or some such...

[19:02] <TimToady> like it was trying to handle \($a, $b, $c) or some such.

[19:02] <ashelyb_> PCR question: how do I write a rule that will match anything up until another string in PCR subset of p6 rules?

[19:04] <TimToady> what's the matter with /.*? string/ ?

[19:05] <TimToady> or are you using :ratchet?

[19:05] <ashelyb_> cause the .* is <rule1> and 'string' is in <rule2> and I cannot get it to work that way

[19:06] <ashelyb_> suppose I have "xyxyxyxyxyz" and the match is /<anything><matches_xyz>

[19:06] <TimToady> if you're using rules then :ratchet is on by default, and .*? will probably end up too short

[19:07] <TimToady> rules and tokens don't backtrack by default

[19:07] <ashelyb_> p::c::regex because calling them through p::c::regex seem work so well and all the tests are also writen with p::c::regex.

[19:08] <ashelyb_> so is there some kind of negative look ahead

[19:08] <TimToady> is <anything> written as a rule or token or regex

[19:08] <TimToady> ?

[19:08] <kolibrie> I'm not sure that .*? is even implemented in PCR :ratchet - it is still listed in the TODO

[19:09] <ashelyb_> I;m currently only using Pugs::Compiler::Regex->install()

[19:09] <TimToady> you can probably use <!before string> if you need a negative lookahead.

[19:09] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[19:10] *** dakkar joined
[19:10] <TimToady> I'm not talking about the routine names, but whether the regexes themselves were declared as rules or tokens or regexes.

[19:10] <TimToady> I really have no clue about the PCR->install interface

[19:10] <ashelyb_> there seems to be a P::C::regex and a P::C::rule ...

[19:11] <ashelyb_> both with install methods

[19:11] <fglock> quantifiers don't backtrack in :ratchet mode in PCR (which is wrong)

[19:11] * kolibrie uses the v6-alpha interface

[19:11] <fglock> the install methods are sugar for *rule = ...

[19:12] *** avaron joined
[19:13] <TimToady> er, quantifiers shouldn't backtrack in :ratchet mode...

[19:13] <fglock> oops, I thought so

[19:13] *** wilx left
[19:13] <fglock> so it is implemented right, after all

[19:14] <TimToady> however, you should be able to override and force a quantifier to backtrack under :ratchet with :+ or whatever it is today...

[19:16] <TimToady> so .*? and .*+ both force backtracking, either eager or greedy.

[19:16] <TimToady> :ratchet just turns off the backtracking on .* .+ etc.

[19:17] <jdv79> thanks TimToady! 

[19:17] <TimToady> actually, I think we changed the extra + to ! or some such.

[19:17] <ashelyb_> my use case is that I have rule1 = /<-[ ]+>/;  and rule2 matches an ip address, but sometimes there is no space between the token for rule1 and the rule2, but I don't want rule1 to gobble the ip address that rule2 is supposed to match.

[19:18] <TimToady> becaause jfriedl claimed ++ for possessive matches.

[19:18] <ashelyb_> so how would I write rule1 to not match any spaces or the ipaddress?

[19:19] *** shobadobs left
[19:19] <fglock> you mean /<-[ ]>+/

[19:19] <ashelyb_> yes I meant that.

[19:20] *** weinig_ joined
[19:20] <fglock> how about \S+

[19:21] <fglock> or \D+

[19:21] <ashelyb_> hmm so rule1  = /\S+?/;    ?

[19:21] <fglock>  \D means 'not a number'

[19:21] <ashelyb_> yeah but rule1 can match on any character but a space.

[19:21] <ashelyb_> even a number

[19:22] <TimToady> yes, we did change it to .*? and .*! to override :ratchet

[19:22] <ashelyb_> my problem is that the space between the rule1 and the ipaddress is optional.

[19:23] <fglock> I've got to go - it's my birthday party :)

[19:23] <ashelyb_> ! happy birthday!

[19:35] <ashelyb_> how would I say don't match xyz?  as a string not as a word class like /<-[a-z]>+/

[19:36] <ashelyb_> <-x><-y><-z>    hmmm

[19:37] <ashelyb_> or no that would probably be <-[x]><-[y]>...

[19:37] <kolibrie> maybe <!'xyz'>

[19:37] <ashelyb_> trying.

[19:39] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - out of curiosity, is there anything neat in the works for pack/unpack since they aren't spec'd yet?

[19:40] <TimToady> haven't really thought about it much.  mostly I think that sort of thing should be handled by serialization roles.

[19:40] <ashelyb_> unknown node: $VAR1 = undef;

[19:40] <ashelyb_> ... it doesn't like the <!'stuff'> syntax...

[19:40] * Limbic_Region often laments for an unpack that remembers where it left off such that you wouldn't need to keep track of x yourself

[19:40] <TimToady> try <!before stuff>

[19:40] <TimToady> where stuff is a re

[19:40] <ashelyb_> where stuff is xyz

[19:40] <ashelyb_> ah

[19:40] <ashelyb_> that's what you meant, trying...

[19:41] <ashelyb_> Undefined subroutine &Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5::not_before called at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.4/Pugs/Emitter/Rule/Perl5.pm line 101.

[19:42] <TimToady> then I'd say negative lookahead is not yet implemented...

[19:42] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - so would strings come with some built in serialization roles or is everything user defined?

[19:43] <TimToady> dunno

[19:43] <Limbic_Region> or rather, instead of trying to force a solution on a problem let me present the problem and ask how you would solve it

[19:45] <Limbic_Region> in general, if I pull a record defined by some unpack format out of a string - I want unpack to remember where I was so next time I get a record I don't have to specify my skip value

[19:48] <TimToady> I think there are several components to the solution.  first, treat the normal pack/unpack templates as a language that compiles down to some internal form.

[19:48] *** weinig_ is now known as weinig|away

[19:48] <TimToady> second, have a way for a class serializer to return one of those compiled thingies without having to re-engineer the pack template syntax.

[19:49] <TimToady> third, have a way for pack/unpack to refer to the current string position like regexen can.

[19:50] <TimToady> possibly there are more unifications with re syntax down the road too

[19:51] <TimToady> basically, think of pack templates as compiling down to a sub that could be called as a rule.

[19:52] <Limbic_Region> ok

[19:52] <TimToady> which basically means unpack could be returning a Capture.

[19:52] <TimToady> and pack would just turn a Capture back into a serialized string.

[19:53] <TimToady> I'm sure there are plenty of details around the devil.

[20:03] <TimToady> I have the crud, which is not so nice.

[20:04] <ingy> I had the crud for the entire month of November

[20:04] <TimToady> comes of living somewhere soggy.  :)

[20:04] <ingy> I ran the Dublin marathon on Oct 30, and got the nastiest thing on the flight home

[20:05] <ingy> comes from flying overseas in the recycled breath of sick people

[20:05] <TimToady> there are an amazing number of bugs that kick you harder when you're already down for some reason.

[20:05] <ingy> yeah, but I never had them set up camp like this before

[20:06] <ingy> anyway, feeling great i a very soggy Seattle at the moment

[20:06] <ingy>                        n

[20:06] <ingy> ooo. lucky spacebar!

[20:07] <TimToady> need a half-space bar

[20:07] <ingy> Capitol Hill - A River Runs Through It

[20:08] <TimToady> on some old typewriters you could fake a half-space because backspace would go back space-and-a-half while the key was down, then revert a half when the key came up.

[20:08] * ingy laughs

[20:08] <ingy> add it to the spec!

[20:09] <TimToady> actually, I preferred the ones where the ordinary space bar went half space when you pushed it down and half space when you let it up.

[20:09] <ingy> nice

[20:09] <TimToady> made it really easy to insert a word that was one character longer.

[20:10] <ingy> oh right, yeah

[20:10] <ingy> that took me a sec

[20:10] <ingy> take a half from each side

[20:10] <TimToady> right

[20:11] <Juerd> Makes me wonder if this was an implementation side effect, or an intended feature :)

[20:11] <ingy> YAML forbids your typewriter

[20:12] <ingy> god i'm glad the halfspace never made it into ascii

[20:12] <TimToady> why? YAML is defined only by what it ain't.

[20:12] <TimToady> unless you're claiming that a typewriter is Markup Language

[20:14] * ingy just has an overwhelming sense of fud around TimToady 

[20:14] <ingy> :)

[20:14] <TimToady> didn't make it into Unicode either.  though we do have thin space, hair space, six-per-em space, punctuation space, and zero-width space...

[20:14] *** stevan__ is now known as stevan

[20:15] <ingy> mostly f :D

[20:15] <TimToady> -Ofud

[20:15] <ingy> YAML has quite a few line endings that it allows

[20:16] <ingy> iirc

[20:16] <ingy> like NEL

[20:17] <ingy> goofy

[20:17] <stevan> ingy!!!!!

[20:18] <ingy> hi stevan!

[20:18] <ingy> it's been a bit

[20:18] <ingy> how you been?

[20:18] * stevan hums the theme to chariots of fire and pictures ingy crossing the finish line in Dublin

[20:19] <stevan> ingy: $work is *finally* starting to let up (holidays and all)

[20:19] <ingy> My whole body seized up with like 300 meters to go

[20:19] <ingy> I almost just fell over

[20:19] <ingy> cause they had this fake finish line that i picked up the pace for

[20:20] <ingy> stevan: yay

[20:20] <stevan> bastards!

[20:20] <ingy> yeah, it was actually the start line with a big arch of balloons

[20:21] <ingy> but the finish was 1/4 mile or so more

[20:21] <stevan> ingy: we are flying nothingmuch out here in Feb. for $work, we should try and organize an East Coast Hackathon or something :)

[20:21] <ingy> stevan: I'm in

[20:21] <stevan> ingy: my house is not big enough to host, but I am sure we can work something out 

[20:21] <ingy> I've started doing a serious Kwiki reorg... Kwiki 2.0

[20:22] <ingy> ok

[20:22] <stevan> cool

[20:22] <ingy> yeah I need to start writing the plugins in Perl6 though

[20:22] <ingy> hmm, that's a really good idea

[20:23] <stevan> I have been hacking Ocaml lately,.. it has a really nice bridge to Perl (perl4caml) and its like Haskell only not as psychotically pure :)

[20:23] <ingy> suprised I just thought of that

[20:23] <ingy> oh yeah?

[20:23] <ingy> what kind of bridge?

[20:25] <stevan> ingy: its pretty low level (dealing with sv,av,hv, etc)

[20:25] <stevan> http://merjis.com/developers/perl4caml

[20:25] <lambdabot> Title: Developers/Perl4Caml

[20:25] <stevan> but its very easy to write a nice wrapper around modules

[20:25] <TimToady> so is there an Ocaml to Haskell bridge?  if so, we're home free. :)

[20:25] *** penk joined
[20:25] <stevan> TimToady: I would think there might be :)

[20:26] <stevan> i mean,.. it sounds enough like a PhD thesis, I am sure someone has tried it :)

[20:27] <TimToady> maybe we should go for a record.  we could send out Perl 6.0.0 and have it require five or six different runtimes all in the same process.

[20:28] <stevan> TimToady: why stop at 5 or 6 ?

[20:28] *** justatheory joined
[20:28] <TimToady> I think that would be a record already...

[20:29] <ingy>  vote for 6 runtimes personally, for obvious reasons

[20:29] <TimToady> doing more than 5 or 6 might slow adoption a tad... :)

[20:30] <ingy> stevan: can you write Perl modules in Caml easily using that bridge?

[20:30] <ingy> Inline::Caml

[20:30] <stevan> ingy: I have been thinking about that actually :)

[20:30] *** dvorak_ joined
[20:30] <stevan> ingy: the trick is that ocaml is very very static

[20:31] <ingy> so is C, no?

[20:32] <stevan> ingy: no, Ocaml has a very aggressive type inferencer which does not lend itself to much flexibility 

[20:32] <stevan> but I am exploring some of the deeper internal modules to see what is possible

[20:32] <stevan> my first goal is to make it possible to subclass a perl class with an ocaml class

[20:32] <ingy> who is coming out with nothingmuch btw?

[20:32] <nnunley> stevan: OCaml provides some nice bits for foreign bindings, as I recall.

[20:33] <stevan> ingy: just him, its actually for $work stuff,.. but I figure we can take a few days off for $play

[20:33] <ingy> wow. hi nnunley!

[20:33] <ingy> where are you these days?

[20:33] <nnunley> Hey, ingy.

[20:33] <nnunley> London, for the time being.

[20:33] <stevan> nnunley: I havent explored those yet 

[20:33] <ingy> stevan: maybe I'll come visit you early, and overlap with nothingmuch

[20:34] <ingy> nnunley: still with fotango?

[20:34] <nnunley> stevan: I think all they require is an opaque pointer with function bindings for calls through to C, as well as a few function bindings for garbage collection.

[20:34] <stevan> why is that I am always attracted to modules which have this type of caveats "Run-time support for objects and classes. All functions in this module are for system use only, not for the casual user."

[20:34] <nnunley> ingy: For the time being.

[20:34] <ingy> nod

[20:42] <ingy> mmm g√∏√∏se

[20:43] <ingy> I wrote an awesome module called Script::Hater

[20:43] <ingy> for generating Configure type scripts from data

[20:43] <ingy> programming in YAML

[20:44] <ingy> I should call it Code::Hater

[20:44] * ingy isa Code::Hater

[20:45] * ingy isa Data::Lover

[20:45] <gaal> call it descript

[20:45] <ingy> how about Scriptnoxious

[20:46] <gaal> NOXcript

[20:46] <ingy> I hope Perl6 is the ultimate mini-language meta-language

[20:47] <gaal> UMLML? eep

[20:48] <ingy> Many programming tasks are well suited to having their own special programming language

[20:48] <ingy> So hopefully changing the P6 grammar is AllThat(tm)
