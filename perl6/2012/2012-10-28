[12:25] *** flightrecorder left
[12:26] <jnthn> pmurias: The way NQP does it is when the runtime pad is created, it gets all of the things from the static lexpad copied into it.

[12:26] *** flightrecorder joined
[12:29] <pmurias> so it's the same way as I'm planning to do

[12:29] <pmurias> jnthn: would looking them up directly from the static lexpad make a difference?

[12:34] <jnthn> pmurias: I think not in NQP. Rakudo does one extra bit of magic here though; it can be set to clone things as it copies. Thus a scalar container installed in the static lexpad is fresh per invocation.

[13:27] <jnthn> nwc10: STD convergence (including getting a bunch of quoting things right that we currently get wrong), supporting quote adverbs (mostly easy to implement once these changes are done), and having things factored in a way that makes doing heredocs approachable.

[13:29] <nwc10> Rakudo doesn't have heredocs yet? So Perl 3 is better than Perl 6, for some things? :-)

[13:29] <jnthn> For heredocs, sure :)

[15:51] <masak> why those two, ooc?

[15:57] <flussence> "response hazy, try again later"

[15:57] <masak> goal: fix this.

[15:58] <masak> the '{{{$code}}}' things in the one-liner above are replaced, at macro apply time, with the macro argument '$counter++'.

[15:59] <masak> however, they currently don't get the right environment. they get something static instead of the runtime lexpad that contains the $counter we want to ++.

[16:00] <jnthn> bah

[16:00] <masak> current consensus is that the solution that needs to be applied already exists in the Rakudo codebase: it's what's being done to make roles get the right environment, even if they are applied "early".

[16:00] <jnthn> So the box I was gonna do the * release on at first has...a versin of tar that doesn't support something the Makefile needs.

[16:48] <TimToady> well, temp was supposed to replace local, but with copy-down semantics when you don't initialize it

[16:49] <TimToady> and left beind the normal localization of a variable by copying its value to a save stack

[16:50] <TimToady> it's true that STD doesn't temporize any normal variables, but that's mainly because we emulate contextuals with local anyway

[18:50] <jnthn> diakopter: It's probably telling the truth... :)

[18:50] <diakopter> yeah

[18:50] <jnthn> diakopter: But I'm surprised we get it...

[18:50] <moritz> diakopter: not 6model error, rather metacicularity error, I think

[18:54] <masak> did I ever list this as an autopun? http://bash.org/?3936

[18:54] <moritz> jnthn: are you aware of any Rakudo LHFs I might attack tonight?

[18:55] <jnthn> moritz: hered...<duck>

[18:55] <masak> hereducks?

[18:55] <moritz> jnthn: here, have a document :-)

[18:55] <jnthn> moritz: If you want to help with the quote branch, quote adverbs should be very do-able now :)

[18:55] <jnthn> (I did much of the things already)

[18:55] <jnthn> moritz: But I'm happy to do that also.

[18:56] <jnthn> moritz: I was looking at the features page earlier and wondered why we miss andthen and orelse

[18:56] <moritz> jnthn: because of the exception-y bits

[18:57] <moritz> currently the are synonyms for || (or was it //?) and &&

[18:57] <moritz> but IMHO they are supposed to do a bit more

[18:57] <jnthn> Yes, looking at S03 at the moment

[18:57] <masak> yes, they do more.

[18:57] <masak> they contextualize on stuff.

[18:58] <jnthn> I can't see anything fundemental that we're missing, fwiw

[18:58] <jnthn> I guess the trick is to thunk anything that's not already a block

[18:58] <jnthn> So for: test1() orelse -> $! { test2() }

[18:59] <jnthn> Thunk the left argument, then pass them along to an infix:<orelse> that goes through its arguments, calls them in order until one works out, and uses .count to know whether to pass the exception, or so.

[19:00] <moritz> r: say 1 andthen 2

[19:00] <p6eval> rakudo ccc4d7: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused␤at /tmp/abFHh8m4TZ:1␤»

[19:01] <jnthn> r: say 1 orelse 2

[19:02] <moritz> multi infix:<orelse>(Mu \a, Mu \b)    { a // b }

[19:02] <jnthn> moritz: STD has it as list associative.

[19:02] <moritz> r: say 1 orelse say 42

[19:02] <p6eval> rakudo ccc4d7: OUTPUT«1␤»

[19:03] <moritz> I don't see how there the thunking happens

[19:03] <jnthn> moritz: Which means it really can be done the loopy way I suggested :)

[19:03] <jnthn> moritz: You'd have to thunk it in Actions.

[19:03] <jnthn> lemme find an example...

[19:03] <moritz> jnthn: but my example above shows that it already thunks

[19:03] <moritz> r: say 1 orelse say 42

[19:03] <p6eval> rakudo ccc4d7: OUTPUT«1␤»

[19:03] <moritz> no 42

[19:04] <moritz> so it thunks

[19:04] <moritz> but it's not even mentioned in Actions.pm

[19:04] <jnthn> moritz: Oh

[19:04] <moritz> oh

[19:04] <jnthn> Becuase || is special

[19:04] <moritz> :pasttype<defor>

[19:04] <jnthn> Yeah

[19:04] <jnthn> So I'm not sure if it ever calls the thing in the setting.

[19:05] <moritz> ah, it's probably only there for reduction meta ops

[19:05] <jnthn> Yeah, I think so

[19:06] <jnthn> moritz: xx_op shows you how xx ends up thunked.

[19:07] <jnthn> well, one side of it

[19:07] <moritz> block_closure(make_thunk_ref($lhs, $/)),

[19:07] <jnthn> *nod*

[19:08] <jnthn> Apart from it's list associative (or should be) so you'd not end up with an lhs and rhs, but rather loop over the things.

[19:08] *** adu left

[20:10] <moritz> at work we have each function in a separate file, and a magic Loader.pm that adds package declarations and sorta-lazily loads them. That loader needs trailing 1;s

[20:11] <tadzik> moritz: did you have a chance to test your branch on windows?

[20:11] <tadzik> panda/custom-lib, that is

[20:11] <moritz> tadzik: no

[20:12] <tadzik> oh, $prefix

[20:12] <tadzik> I read that as 'my $prefix' for some reason, nevermind me

[20:13] <moritz> fwiw the branch works locally

[20:13] *** NamelessTee left
[20:13] <moritz> though I guess it doesn't handle all corner cases directly

[20:14] <tadzik> yeah, I'm just double-allergic to touching bootstrap.pl after it finally started working on windowses :)

[20:14] <tadzik> I'm testing it locally now, it looks ok by looking at it

[20:14] *** flightrecorder left
[20:14] <moritz> like if there's a non-writable  panda dir, it'll simply bootstrap into another one

[20:14] <moritz> not sure if that's the correct thing to do, or if it should die instead

[20:14] *** SamuraiJack_ left
[20:15] <moritz> phenny: ask FROGGS if we he could please test the panda/custom-lib branch on windows (requires a pretty recent rakudo, for example the 2012.10 release)

[20:44] <moritz> thats as a nice LHF, but I was so unconcentrated that I needed many, many recompile cycles, which took up all of the time
