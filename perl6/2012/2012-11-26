[08:55] <sorear> I'm connected to irc.freenode.net port 6667

[08:55] <sorear> you connected to the right place

[08:55] <sorear> freenode's servers are named after authors

[08:55] <sorear> after joining asimov.freenode.net, you join #perl6

[08:56] <sorear> on PC clients it's usually done by typing /join #perl6

[08:56] <sorear> dunno about your android clienrt

[18:49] <moritz> is there a cross-make compatible way to execute a command and put the result in a variable?

[20:48] <moritz> you mean that ufo is slowly growing, with neither a perspective to becoming smaller again, nor having a real design?

[20:49] <masak> oh, I wasn't really thinking of ufo here.

[20:49] <masak> the lack of design there is probably because I'm kind of an absentee original author.

[20:49] <masak> I was thinking of Rakudo/Perl 6 and library handling.

[20:50] <masak> and it's tricky because I don't really know of a better way to solve this than gradual evolution.

[20:52] * masak .oO( NoEvent )

[20:52] <tadzik> if it's not, then we still have the issue of busy waiting, so Probably No

[20:53] <masak> what's the issue of busy waiting, and is there a solution in sight?

[20:54] <FROGGS> I'd say if a event loop is busy when waiting than it is missing a delay...

[20:55] <moritz> it's missing a callback :-)

[20:55] <tadzik> moritz: we'll need a poll() that works on more than one socket :)

[20:58] <jnthn> 50 shades of grey? Isn't that the Visual Studio 2012 default color scheme?

[21:03] <FROGGS> maybe MS should hire some designers? to round up the edges of their life-tiles or what it is called and to introduce ucfirst on menus

[21:05] <FROGGS> the thing is, even if you want to use their software (windows phone development tools with VS2012 express), then after installing windows 7 and its sdk for a day in a VM you get stuck when they wanna have 37$ just to let you copy the examples to your phone

[21:05] <FROGGS> -.-

[21:05] <FROGGS> wasted a day because of that

[21:06] <tadzik> maybe they should hire some logical thinkers :) They still didn't respond to my email "how do I bootstrap a windows dvd image"

[21:06] <tadzik> I get free copies of windows as a student, but they don't come as .iso files, but as an .exe which downloads an .iso

[21:07] <tadzik> I asked them if they expect me to come over to piratebay and get a windows there so I can download my legal copy

[21:07] <moritz> try wine :-)

[21:07] <tadzik> no, it didn't work :)

[21:07] <tadzik> it used to, but they fixed something with their downloader and now it doesn't ;)

[21:07] <masak> becoming an alcoholic is seldom the answer.

[21:07] <popl> No, it didn't work the first time I tried it either tadzik.

[21:08] <popl> I was in a similar situation.

[21:08] <tadzik> oh, they respond to emails eventually?

[21:08] <tadzik> well, I run a piratebay copy anyway; torrent uploaders are capable of making an install image that installs on an USB disk, microsoft apparently isn't

[21:09] <tadzik> maybe it's better with windows 8
