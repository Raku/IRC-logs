[00:26] <pmichaud> I don't think my first talk has made it to YouTube yet.

[00:26] <pmichaud> I'm really eager/hoping to see the lightning talk make it.

[00:26] <pmichaud> For the blacked out parts, my slides are available at http://pmichaud.com/2012/pres/ if it helps.

[00:27] <pmichaud> afk # sleep or something like that

[00:27] <sorear> pmichaud: why blackouts?

[00:27] <sorear> copyright zealotry?

[00:38] <colomon> what was the lightning talk on?

[00:48] <cog__> pmichaud, thx for the links

[00:49] <sorear> o/ kst

[01:08] <cog__> pmichaud, I don't understand this slide.  http://pmichaud.com/2012/pres/yapcna-lists-1/slides/slide42g.html#end

[01:09] <cog__> how come it does not always say "cherry"?

[01:12] <cog__> ok, I got it. the container is replaced by a value. But the container content is unchanged.

[01:13] <cog__> bedtime overdue, I am becoming dense.

[02:14] <sorear> o/ alester

[02:14] <alester> hiya

[02:17] <quietfanatic> I I recall his pie chart correctly, it's about a third C, a third NQP, and a third Perl 6

[02:17] <quietfanatic> *If I recall

[02:19] <quietfanatic> alester: http://pmichaud.com/2012/pres/yapcna-perflt/slides/slide37.html

[02:19] <alester> That's a lot of C for me to play with.

[02:19] <alester> I like C.

[02:19] <alester> I can instrument it.

[02:20] <alester> mmmm.

[02:20] *** thou left
[02:20] <quietfanatic> C is nice.

[02:20] <quietfanatic> but can't really be ported to VMs I think

[02:20] <quietfanatic> This 

[02:20] <quietfanatic> C is mostly extensions to Parrot, I believe

[02:21] <JimmyZ_> alester: the most C code is 3rdparty

[02:21] *** z3ndrag0n joined
[02:21] <alester> Did I miss two parties already?

[02:22] <JimmyZ_> alester: most c code is here https://github.com/perl6/nqp/tree/master/3rdparty, I think ;)

[02:22] <alester> aha

[02:22] <alester> I didn't realize that rakudo and nqp were two different projects

[02:23] <sorear> forgivable, they are both pmichaud/jnthn projects

[02:23] <alester> Clearly I have been out of p6 land for a while

[02:23] <sorear> and they are much more tightly coupled to each other than either is to Parrot

[03:16] <pmichaud> I didn't count 3rdparty in that pie chart

[03:17] <pmichaud> the pie chart is nqp-specific code

[03:17] <pmichaud> the 3rdparty libraries are separate from that (just as I wouldn't include the line counts for icu, parrot, etc.)

[03:17] <pmichaud> alester: ^^^

[03:18] <pmichaud> the c code in nqp could use some love, yes.  we get a fair number of gcc warnings from the code (primarily because jnthn++ develops in a windows environment)

[03:18] <alester> My ack -f --cc | xargs wc -l only comes up with 3477 lines.

[03:18] <alester> gcc warngings?!?!

[03:19] <pmichaud> it's entirely possible that my script counted the wrong things

[03:19] <alester> COMPILER WARNING SILENCER MAN TO THE RESCUE

[03:19] <pmichaud> alester: let me know if you need any commit bits (I suspect you already have them)

[03:19] <pmichaud> let me re-run my counter

[03:19] <alester> on rakduo/raukudo?

[03:19] <pmichaud> oh!

[03:20] <pmichaud> no, the counts were for rakudo/rakudo and perl6/nqp combined

[03:20] <pmichaud> perl6/nqp is the one that gives us all the compiler warnings

[03:21] <alester> ok

[03:22] <alester> YAPC always makes me so inspired to want to work on stuff.

[05:37] * sorear hugs mberends

[05:37] * mberends hugs sorear back

[05:39] <mberends> sorear: some backlogs suggested you're thinking of dropping out of your studies. Please don't, I carry a deep regret for a similar mistake.

[05:43] <sorear> it really, really sucks to make a difficult decision and then have people you thought were your friends complain about it.

[05:46] <mberends> I'm sorry to upset you, but I care too much to stand idly by.

[05:47] <sorear> I suspect that our circumstances are radically different

[05:48] <sorear> mine has everything to do with a crashing state education budget adding two years to my transfer time

[05:48] <sorear> i'd be perfectly happy to resume education in a place with actually working schools

[05:49] <mberends> that is a big problem, and I saw that you had given it plenty of hard thought

[05:51] <mberends> I keep desiring to catch up the qualification deficit afterwards, and get blocked by tuit shortage. Next week I'll be seeing a university college in London with the same purpose again.

[05:51] <sorear> right now half the internet is telling me that an AS is not worth three years of my life, and the other half is saying it is

[05:51] <sorear> so I'm just going to ignore the internet and follow my heart

[05:51] <mberends> ok, I won't nag

[06:05] <sorear> sorry for reacting so harshly.

[06:07] <mberends> no worries, you'll be fine, me too :-)

[22:43] <p6eval> rakudo a2bacb:  ( no output )

[22:43] <timotimo> is # a comment character?

[22:43] <quietfanatic> yes

[22:43] * timotimo facepalms

[22:44] <timotimo> can i override that with an is parsed macro or something?

[22:44] <quietfanatic> though perhaps prefix:<#> ought to override it

[22:44] <timotimo> if i want to write color values as literals?

[22:44] <quietfanatic> I don't know

[22:44] <timotimo> right, no worries :)

[22:45] <quietfanatic> I prefer to write colors as hex integers and have the color class automatically convert from them

[22:45] <quietfanatic> if you can do that in Perl 6 yet

[22:45] <quietfanatic> though maybe that's not the best anyway

[22:45] <timotimo> yeah, but then i have to write 0x before each :P

[22:45] <quietfanatic> yeah yeah

[22:45] <timotimo> with an is parsed macro, i can do that automatically

[22:46] <quietfanatic> Well I don't know how to is parsed.

[22:46] <timotimo> i'd like to write a crazy/crappy DSL

[22:46] <timotimo> well, macros aren't there yet, so is parsed doesn't exist yet ;)

[22:46] <quietfanatic> subs can be is parsed too, can't they?

[22:46] <timotimo> no idea tbh

[22:46] <timotimo> what would that do?

[22:47] <quietfanatic> It would be like an is parsed macro but it would be a sub

[22:47] <quietfanatic> I dunno

[22:47] <timotimo> so it would get what's inside the brackets as a string?

[22:48] <timotimo> i don't really know what exactly is parsed means

[22:54] <timotimo> maybe i'll quickly describe my situation

[22:54] <timotimo> our hackerspace is getting a new light installation with controllable RGB LEDs

[22:54] <timotimo> i'm writing a high level protocol thingie in python currently and want to redo it from scratch (including new planning) in perl6 as a DSL

[22:55] <timotimo> (why write control flow and label support yourself if you can use your host instead)

[22:56] <timotimo> so there would be commands like "at the cursor position, insert N colors, move the cursor position N further" and at every place you could write "random" instead of a color or position and you would be able to add fading specifications etc etc

[23:21] <flussence> that one works for me locally... odd

[23:21] <flussence> (though not the answer you wanted :)

[23:22] <flussence> oh never mind... it's just returning "yoink" and the REPL prints that. Dunno why it does that though
