[01:44] <sorear> chinyaw: I need to understand WHY you want to do this.

[01:45] <sorear> colomon: check out S2x and Rakudo's behavior, I guess

[01:47] <chinyaw> sorear: i think it was you? :$ i needed to change value of fstp qword ptr [ebx+000007C0] so that it return something else without messing all the code, simple mov did not work :( so i think of change value on top of stack just before the fstp qword ptr [ebx+000007C0] command may let me have the value i need in ebx+000007C0

[01:48] <geekosaur> my question is why ask here?  we're not in general assembler programmers, certainly not with intel syntax

[01:48] <sorear> chinyaw: you shouldn't be using st(0) in amd64 code anyway

[04:05] <sorear> colomon: What's the difference between .Bridge and .Numeric?

[04:08] <sorear> I'm a little suprised that compiles

[04:08] <sorear> The main reason it doesn't work is that RunInferior and GetInferiorRoot aren't pairs

[04:08] <sorear> paired

[04:10] <sorear> something like

[04:10] <colomon> .Bridge is the Real method to return a Num (may be something more general than a Num on hypothetical implementations).  .Numeric can return any Numeric type.

[04:10] <sorear> o = Kernel.RunInferior(o.InvokeMethod(Kernel.GetInferiorRoot(), "Bridge", new Variable[] { v }, null)).Fetch();

[04:10] <sorear> then copy lines 10-14

[04:11] <sorear> that will allow Bridge to return any primitive numeric type

[04:11] <sorear> why Real and not Numeric, btw?

[04:12] *** zjmarlow joined
[04:12] <colomon> not sure I understand the question?

[04:13] <sorear> class FunnyComplex does Numeric { method Bridge() { 1+2i } } # why isn't this allowed?

[04:13] <colomon> ..... it's an interesting thought

[04:14] <colomon> the specific reason for Bridge is to enable Reals from different sources to still communicate with each other.

[04:16] <colomon> but extending it to Numeric (and requiring to output core numeric types) might be a different and somewhat more powerful way of getting the same effect.

[04:16] <colomon> I'm going to have to sleep on that one.  :)

[08:27] <moritz> \o sorear

[08:30] <moritz> jnthn: re real-trouble, I have an idea what's going on here

[08:31] <moritz> method numeric methods (for example .exp) work like this in nom:

[08:31] <moritz> there's a method in Real, which redispatches to self.Bridge.Num

[08:31] <moritz> erm, self.Bridge.exp

[08:32] <moritz> and the result type of the .Bridge call needs to have an .exp method that actually does the work

[08:32] <moritz> and our bridge type is Num

[08:32] <moritz> now we compose Real into Num (instead of an inheritance relation)

[08:33] <moritz> and we get both multi methods (the one that does the work, and the one from Real that just re-dispatches), and of course they have the same signature, so we get an ambiguous dispatch

[08:35] <moritz> nom: role A { method x() { } }; class B does A { }; say A.^can('x').[0]

[08:43] <p6eval> nom 9a1e64: OUTPUT¬´(timeout)¬ª

[08:43] <sorear> looks like p6eval can't make a check fail

[08:44] <sorear> moritz: the fix is to not use multi methods

[08:44] <sorear> moritz: with 0 arguments a multi is kinda pointless anywya

[08:44] <moritz> oh, I'm on a different branch

[08:45] <moritz> sorear: or if you want to dispatch based on :D/:U

[08:45] <sorear> idea for an optimization with huge winness: short-circuit the multi dispatcher when there's only one candidate

[08:46] <moritz> is there a way to ignore/override all the multis from a role, and declare new multis instead?

[11:52] <muixirt> the merge_sort version of Util works with 2011.07 but not with my fresh nom. Due to spec changes?

[11:56] <masak> don't think so.

[12:40] <jnthn> That code doesn't hang locally. The undeclared routines thing doesn't either.

[12:40] <masak> muixirt: it's not just you. it's been illegible since the switch to nom.

[12:41] <moritz> 4cb15ac8a3d4c1c481e312cfb07658367f8935ad has caused the loop in CHECK failure reporting, it seems

[12:41] <moritz> jnthn: which branch are you on?

[12:41] <jnthn> Just skip the entire of the second sub down.

[12:41] <moritz> jnthn: git pull :-)

[12:42] <jnthn> moritz: Yeah - I saw the multi conflict, but now I start to see why it happens.

[12:43] <jnthn> huh, the Order patch caused the CHECK reporting failure?!

[12:43] <moritz> only-methods in Real don't have that problem

[12:43] <jnthn> moritz: Right, because there's no composition conflict there.

[12:43] <moritz> jnthn: I kinda guess it broke some code in the exception handler, which now loops

[12:44] <jnthn> moritz: The exception handler where?

[12:44] <moritz> the one we install in src/core/Exception.pm

[12:44] <moritz> becaues it doesn't hang with --ll-exception

[18:53] <jnthn> +S05-metasyntax/intoplating-closure.t

[18:53] <jnthn> ...interpolating? :)

[18:54] <TimToady> so do we need specwork to get to Hashes with === semantics?  Or is it just enough to say that .WHICH.Str is the obvious default string to hash

[18:54] <jnthn> TimToady: I was planning to try the .WHICH.Str approach.

[18:54] <jnthn> TimToady: It's on the todo list...just didn't get to it yet 

[18:54] <TimToady> as long as infinite structures always come out with OO-based .WHICH, I think it'll work

[18:55] <TimToady> (and assuming .Str never throws away any important part of the .WHICH

[18:55] <TimToady> which could result in a DOS attack.)

[18:56] <TimToady> for example, if we used .gist instead of .Str, and some .WHICH turned out to throw away anything after position N, then the attacker merely supplies a list of values that are not unique except after N

[18:56] <TimToady> the main thing is that everything about the identity must participate in the hash somehow

[18:57] <TimToady> (and, of course, the hash function itself should be randomized)

[18:58] <TimToady> okay, well, I'm not pushing for it, except that I'd also like to see real Sets and Bags someday based on Hash :)

[19:00] <TimToady> well, and the invert bug probably wouldn't have happened...

[19:01] <jnthn> TimToady: True, though it was a horribly inefficient way to implement SomeEnumType.(UnderlyingValue)

[19:02] *** kaare__ is now known as kaare_

[19:56] <moritz> hm, maybe if I run the parrot binary directly?

[19:57] <jnthn> TimToady: Is string binding rejecting it such a problem if many of the places we care about it working have a Cool or Any coercive candidate?

[19:58] <moritz> well, if we mix the number into a Str,  sub MAIN(Int $x) { }  will reject it, no?

[19:58] <TimToady> it's less of a problem if we can declare Str() as a coercive parameter

[20:12] <TimToady> maybe allomorphic literals is a reasonable place to use MI

[20:12] <moritz> colomon: it is.

[20:13] *** s1n left
[20:13] <moritz> colomon: so if you did   class A is Int { }; A.new(3) + 5, you'd get an A as the result, not an Int

[20:14] <moritz> colomon: and the example with the role mixed in that would mean that the result always stringified to 7, because that's encoded into the type object

[20:15] <jnthn> Ah, the reason I don't want to let you do a mixin to an existing object to make it become MI is that it means you can't rely on checking an object has SI memory layout and relying on it for optimization in a sequence of follow-up operations (e.g. checking it before a loop), since another thread may un-MI it.

[20:15] <jnthn> er, un-SI it

[20:16] <masak> TimToady: maybe that would work for Inf and -Inf, too? making them both Int and Num and Str, I mean.

[20:16] <masak> well, maybe they don't actually need to be Str, come to think of it.

[20:16] <masak> maybe that's better left as a special case.

[20:16] <jnthn> Though maybe the idea that a mixin may move object memory already hoses such optimizations...

[20:18] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Merge remote branch 'origin/fix-n-p' into nom

[20:18] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/326de8c815

[20:19] <TimToady> here's another whacked out idea: make all numeric types derive via Str, since they all have a stringy representation

[20:20] <TimToady> but that certainly would make jnthn++ very unhappy :)

[20:20] <masak> that's how Moose has it.

[20:20] <jnthn> TimToady: Why would that one make me very unhappy? :)

[20:20] <jnthn> TimToady: We keep SI.

[20:21] <masak> I can't immediately see why I would be unhappy about it... :)

[20:21] <moritz> wouldn't that mean you have to carry an addition string around per number?

[20:21] <jnthn> oh

[20:21] <TimToady> would that imply that all numbers have to carry a string repr?

[20:21] <jnthn> TimToady: It'd mean they were a pointer bigger.

[20:21] <geekosaur> welcome back to p5? :)

[20:21] <TimToady> or we fudge it somehow

[20:22] <jnthn> TimToady: In the latest 6model, a REPR doesn't have to own a whole object, but just works in terms of a chunk of memory under its management.

[20:23] <TimToady> but we're kinda talking about an optional REPR here...

[20:23] <TimToady> like a union

[20:23] <jnthn> TimToady: So this case doesn't mean more allocations, it just means the objects are a bit bigger

[20:23] <jnthn> TimToady: I don't see how it's unionish.

[20:24] <TimToady> if you want to save the extra alloc

[20:24] <TimToady> sizewise

[20:24] <jnthn> TimToady: But I thought we'd want to keep the original thing PLUS the extra way of looking at it?

[20:25] <sorear> looks like val() is becoming contentious again

[20:25] * sorear scratches it off the TODO

[20:25] *** fsergot left
[20:25] <jnthn> If you can find a way to stash a discriminator bit I guess you could discriminate between a single value and a pointer off to a list of allomorphs.

[20:26] <TimToady> well, I'm still thinking MI is the better approach, if the storage falls out naturally

[20:26] <TimToady> class IntStr is Int is Str {...}

[20:27] <jnthn> Yeah, if you declare it that way, it will

[20:27] <jnthn> Oh.

[20:27] <jnthn> It means we need a way to box two thingies into a single object.

[20:27] <sorear> will not quite work currently in niecza, but fixable

[20:28] <jnthn> 6model core handles it fine though.

[20:28] <sorear> colomon++ blog

[20:28] <TimToady> and it's only the literals or textual inputs that need this allomorphism

[20:29] <TimToady> the val things

[20:29] <TimToady> we need a name for 'em

[20:29] <jnthn> TimToady: Would be just declare type IntSr, NumStr and RatStr?

[20:29] <jnthn> *IntStr

[20:29] <TimToady> I think so

[20:29] <sorear> PairStr, BoolStr?

[20:30] <TimToady> again, the question is whether multi (Int) vs multi (Str) will give the edge to the Int nature

[20:30] <TimToady> that's the point at which we might need to force it slightly

[20:30] <jnthn> nom: class IntStr is Int is Str { }; multi m(Int) { say 1 }; multi m(Str) { say 2 }

[20:30] <p6eval> nom e396ad:  ( no output )

[20:30] <jnthn> er

[20:30] <jnthn> nom: class IntStr is Int is Str { }; multi m(Int) { say 1 }; multi m(Str) { say 2 }; m(IntStr)

[20:30] <p6eval> nom e396ad: OUTPUT¬´Ambiguous dispatch to multi 'm'. Ambiguous candidates had signatures:‚ê§:(Int)‚ê§:(Str)‚ê§‚ê§  in block <anon> at /tmp/KMaut4j_ty:1‚ê§  in <anon> at /tmp/KMaut4j_ty:1‚ê§¬ª

[20:30] <jnthn> Yeah.

[20:31] <TimToady> some way to make Str defer to numbers, basically

[20:31] *** nallar|afk is now known as nallar

[20:31] <TimToady> in an epsilonish sort of way

[20:31] <jnthn> Wait, which one do we want to have as the winner? :)

[20:31] *** birdwindupbird left
[20:32] <TimToady> the numeric, I think

[20:32] <jnthn> .oO( class Int beats Str { } )

[20:33] <TimToady> .oO(rock paper scissors)

[20:38] <TimToady> or maybe somehow we can notice that an MI object is involved, and use the parentage of the object itself as some kind of tiebreaker

[20:38] <jnthn> TimToady: er

[20:38] <TimToady> maybe only if we actually get an ambiguous dispatch otherwise as a failover

[20:38] <TimToady> or however you say it in English

[20:39] <jnthn> sub foo(Int $x) { $x + 1 } # we never get an ambiguous dispatch here. We already inlined.

[20:39] *** kaare__ left
[20:39] <TimToady> thinking about your ambiguous dispatch above

[20:40] <jnthn> TimToady: I have a feeling your suggestion may be sneaking effective mutability into our immutable candidate lists through the back door.

[20:41] <TimToady> I don't see it, but maybe if I think about it for a month or two...

[20:41] <jnthn> TimToady: I'll see if I can come up with an example.

[20:44] <jnthn> TimToady: Hm. It may be OK.

[20:47] *** kaare__ joined
[20:47] <jnthn> class IntStr is Int is Str { }

[20:47] <jnthn> multi x(Int $x) { y($x) } # wins, and has inlined y

[20:47] <jnthn> multi x(Str) { } # loses

[20:47] <jnthn> multi y(Int) { } # can we construct another y candidate that causes issues?

[20:47] <jnthn> The existence of a multi y(IntStr) { } would have prevented the compile time decision or inlining of the y($x) call

[20:57] <sorear> Wait, does S02:3573 require '' inside ¬´¬ª to suppress _interpolation_?
