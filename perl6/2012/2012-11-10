[04:15] <colomon> regular barrel of laughs.

[04:16] <colomon> got it narrowed down to one patch, and it was all whitespace.

[04:17] <colomon> eventually worked out the problem was that not everything had recompiled properly ever time.

[04:57] * diakopter has been hunting a "bug" for several days

[04:58] <diakopter> only to realize, finally, if I cut out 98% of the code paths I thought could have been causing the problem, the problem still exists. So it's a problem with my measurement and testing harness.

[05:42] <Woodi> so sorear you going to academia ? :)

[05:45] <sorear> doubt it

[05:48] <Woodi> I like to read D. Parnas articles lastly. he wanted to be physics scientist but one day he realized his life objective is "not to discover next digit in some constant representation". ant then he goes for better software...

[05:49] <Woodi> "software crisis" was coined in 70s ? :)

[05:50] * Woodi coffe...

[05:50] <sorear> my life objective is to settle another world

[05:51] <diakopter> surely that requires billions

[05:52] <diakopter> (how would you like to earn billions)

[05:56] <sorear> in order to have a proper settlement, we need to invent cost-cutting measures.  you can't build a proper settlement society out of billionaires.

[05:56] <sorear> one needs more diversity than that

[05:57] <sorear> and if I knew exactly what I needed to do.... I probably wouldn't be here ^_^

[05:57] <diakopter> ohI didn't mean send billionaires there

[05:58] <diakopter> I meant it sould require billions to send a monkey there

[05:59] <sorear> right now my subgoal is more "cultivate every talent that could conceivably be of any use"

[05:59] <[Coke]> geekosaur: github.com/perl6/Pugs.hs

[06:00] <sorear> diakopter: we need to get the mass transit cost to $100k a head or so.

[06:00] <sorear> I'm certain this will be easier than proving P!=NP

[06:01] <diakopter> so do that first :)

[06:02] <sorear> plausible designs for low-amortized-cost space transport are a dime a dozen in the SF literature

[06:02] <sorear> _nobody_ has a plausible design for a proof of P!=NP

[06:02] <diakopter> I didn't mean mazs transit cost. I meant research and development costs to send the first monkey

[06:04] <sorear> 1. wait for global recession to end

[06:04] <sorear> 2. worm my way into the ESA top brass

[06:04] <sorear> 3. profit

[06:05] <sorear> ISRO would also be a good candidate, but might be more difficult to infiltrate

[06:07] <sorear> (for a visibly-foreign person)

[13:35] <jaffa4> longest token matching.. WHat is the point of that?

[13:37] <masak> when you call a set of multimethods and several of them match, you want the one that matches the narrowest.

[13:37] <masak> for example, if you pass (5, 42) to something with either the signature (Any, Any) or (Int, Int), you'd prefer the latter because it's narrower.

[13:38] <masak> similarly, when parsing, you'd prefer the alternation or subrule that matches as long a prefix as possible, because it probable has the best idea of what it's doing.

[13:39] <masak> for example maybe the input "sub foo" would match both a rule for function calls and function declarations. but the former would only match "sub" and the latter would match the whole "sub foo". so LTM (correctly) prefers the latter.

[13:40] <jaffa4> ok

[13:41] <masak> there really is a deep, strange consistency between multi calls and LTM. they do start to differ at some point, though, namely when they fail. routines give up right away, but subrules/alternations start to backtrack and recursively try the second best match, etc.

[13:44] <jaffa4> another issue, how to copy the matches into variables...in Perl6? In Perl 5, there was a shortcut for that.

[13:44] <jaffa4> e.g. ($basename) = ( $filename ~~ /^(.+)[.][^\\]+$/ );

[13:50] *** am0c_ is now known as am0c

[14:15] <masak> works on my box, but last word is "Fez", which is obviously not all output.

[14:15] <masak> Woodi: there is no sigil for the bag type. it's not important enough.

[14:15] <masak> Woodi: however, sigils are part of the (mutable) grammar, so presumably if you care enough you should be able to add one in user code. (eventually)

[14:16] <masak> moritz: could the current factoring of cmdline options be extended to handle -ne ?

[14:17] <masak> moritz: it's such a small shortcut, but I find I miss it...

[14:20] <Woodi> masak: so @array and %hash are "aliases" ? eg. $array.push is valid ? I wonder if all varibles can be $ prefixed (threated as objects) and methods/subs called on them

[14:32] <jaffa4> but not with Rakudo

[14:33] <masak> um. line 12 is commented out.

[14:34] <jaffa4> it is in the rule expression, I guess

[14:34] <masak> oh, sorry. my lines were out of alignment.

[14:34] <masak> line 12 is 'rule expression'

[14:34] <masak> nothing wrong with it, as far as I can see.

[14:41] <colomon> there you go

[14:43] <masak> \o/

[14:43] <masak> well, a Bag is unordered, so % makes sense.

[14:44] <Woodi> shouldn't there be conversion to hash ?

[14:44] <masak> what do you mean?

[14:45] <Woodi> % is hash so %name = .... should be "casted" me think...

[14:47] <jnthn> % means Associative

[14:47] <jnthn> Well, in so far as what you can bind to it.

[14:48] <masak> what jnthn said. % doesn't mean Hash.

[14:48] <colomon> and Bag is Associative

[14:49] <Woodi> and what cathegory Associative is ? :) I mean what kind of stuff that superset contains ?

[14:49] <masak> Associative is a role.

[14:49] <masak> it's quite a loose contract that expects .{} to be implemented on a type.

[14:50] <Woodi> ok :) now what .{} means ? :)

[16:09] <geekosaur> I have 7.4.2.  I don't recall any major changes between the two offhand

[16:10] <geekosaur> oh.  it's failing to find the perl5 devel headers

[16:11] <geekosaur> I don't think I can help with that, need to find someone who knows how perl5 is installed on feather/can do something about it

[16:11] <geekosaur> I don't even have an account on feather

[16:11] <[Coke]> I have root on feather. :)

[16:12] <[Coke]> I just don't know what to do with it.

[16:19] *** domidumont joined

[16:30] <[Coke]> libperl-dev is installe.

[16:32] <geekosaur> perl ‚àíMConfig ‚àíe 'print "‚àíI$Config{archlibexp}/CORE"'

[16:33] <geekosaur> check if the directory that wants to use exists and has the right perl headers in it

[16:41] <geekosaur> specifically the one the error message is complaining about

[16:42] <[Coke]> Can't open perl script "‚àíMConfig": No such file or directory

[16:42] * geekosaur just got that too, and is confused

[16:43] <geekosaur> ...works with macports perl, not with system perl. huh?

[16:43] <geekosaur> hm, maybe it's soemthing weird in the paste, I just did it manually

[16:44] <geekosaur> yeh, I think it copy-pasted nonbreaking spaces or 

[16:44] <geekosaur> something

[16:44] *** PacoAir joined
[16:44] <[Coke]> ok. so there's a dir.

[16:47] <geekosaur> oh, wait, I'm looking att the wrong thing

[16:47] <geekosaur> that header shouldbe installed by HsPerl5

[16:48] *** domidumont left
[16:48] <geekosaur> you need to install the stuff in that repo in the proper order or cabal will install out of date versions from hackage, which might be causing you issues

[16:50] <geekosaur> "ghc-pkg unregister" any installed versions first
