[00:40] <lue> rakudo's .write(Buf) method currently returns True (which I assume means "all bytes written"), instead of the number of bytes written like it's supposed to. Is this a known bug?

[00:41] <lue> s/it's/its/

[00:44] <flussence> the True value is hardcoded, which I'm pretty sure is a bug. Can't find anything in RT about it though

[12:12] <pmurias> hoelzro: isn't the meaning the same as with normal methods?

[12:12] <hoelzro> I have no idea

[12:12] <hoelzro> I just came across it in Grammar.pm, and this is the first I've seen of it

[12:12] *** hbg joined
[12:12] <pmurias> hoelzro: I think so, can't find it in spec

[12:13] <hoelzro> what invokes a token, though?

[12:13] * hoelzro may just need a better understanding of the regex stuff

[12:14] <hoelzro> oh, I see

[12:14] <hoelzro> a rule can invoke a subrule via <subrule(...)>

[12:14] <hoelzro> interesting

[12:15] <hbg> pmurias: I was disconnected so I didn't see any messages for a few minutes 

[12:15] <hbg> So what do you think about redesigning perl6.org website?

[12:15] <pmurias> that depends on what it's redesigned too ;)

[12:17] <pmurias> hbg: do you want to redesign it or do you just dislike it?

[12:18] <pmurias> hbg: personally I sort of like the layout but the page could be made more pretty

[12:19] <hbg> pmurias: I like how simple it is now, I just just wanted to see what community think about idea that someone try to redesign website

[12:20] <hbg> pmurias: and I would be glad to help with redesign, to make it more modern and that could possible atract more people to get involved in project

[12:20] <hbg> pmurias: not just programmers but also designers and people who are interested in marketing,etc

[12:23] <pmurias> I think nobody would protest a prettier/better website ;)

[12:23] <pmurias> myself I don't have much graphic design skills so I can't help much

[12:26] <pmurias> jnthn: re format, I now see the description was correct. I was mistaking extra offsets for data as duplication

[12:29] <hbg> I was involved in other open source projects where I also worked on design so I wanted to see if I can help perl community with my skills 

[12:29] <hbg> I can show you some examples of my work

[22:48] * [Coke] gets "make test" to work on non-windows for nqp-jvm-prep.

[22:52] <[Coke]> I've committed a few things to master in a fork of jnthn++'s repo - how can I make a pull request on github of one of those commits?

[22:52] <[Coke]> (it looks like when I hit "pull request" it wants to include all of them.)

[22:55] <[Coke]> ah, if I go to the commit first, that helps.

[23:31] <[Coke]> nqp: nqp::gcd_i(1000);

[23:31] <p6eval> nqp: OUTPUT«error:imcc:syntax error, unexpected IREG, expecting '(' ('$I5003')␤ in file '(file unknown)' line 170070022␤␤»

[23:31] <[Coke]> masak: ^^

[23:34] <sorear> that's expected, itsn't it?

[23:34] <sorear> gcd_i isn't an instruction so imcc thinks it must be a function call

[23:34] <sorear> the parser and emitter get out of sync, hilarity ensues

[23:39] <[Coke]> sorear: ah, was hoping for a more friendly error,

[23:39] <[Coke]> sorear: where is nqp's gcd op? (trying to implement https://github.com/jnthn/nqp-jvm-prep/blob/master/docs/LHF.md)
