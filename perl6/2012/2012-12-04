[00:24] <japhb_> pmurias, most of the benchmarks are microbenchmarks that I just run with -e. Perlito*, despite needing separate compile and run phases in some modes, could still accept a -e for the compile phase, pretty much just treating it as a special case of a normal script.

[00:32] <pmurias> japhb_: I could add -e easily

[00:32] <pmurias> japhb_: you are measuring compile time and runtime together?

[00:32] <japhb_> pmurias, oh excellent

[00:32] <japhb_> I generally am only measuring runtime, as I recall.  Lemme check again, it's been a while.

[00:34] <japhb_> Nope, I'm wrong -- I measure both together, but then the compile time can be subtracted out in "ignore startup time" mode during analysis.

[00:34] <pmurias> japhb_: it still needs to be piped into node

[09:18] <jnthn> .panic = die right away

[09:18] *** cognominal joined
[09:18] <jnthn> .sorry = die after up to 10 of them, or at the end of parse if we got any

[09:18] <jnthn> .worry = don't die, just report the things when we do

[09:19] <jnthn> er, when we're done parsing, I meant

[09:19] <jnthn> no, I meant what I said and the other thing also :)

[09:19] <jnthn> Gee, I'm so on the ball this morning :P

[09:21] <moritz> I see what you're getting to, anyway

[09:21] <moritz> so, worry are warnings, and delayed until the end of the parse

[09:21] <moritz> and sorry are delayed fatal errors, right?

[09:22] <jnthn> Yes

[09:22] <jnthn> But if we ever panic, we want to report the worry and worry things

[09:22] <jnthn> *and sorry

[09:22] <jnthn> bah, more coffee clearly is needed

[09:23] <moritz> so the exception printer needs to become aware of @*SORRY and @*WORRY, right?

[09:23] <jnthn> Well, that's one approach but then how do we test them?

[09:23] <jnthn> Also feels we couple things a bit much...

[09:24] <moritz> hm

[09:24] <moritz> maybe we need an exception type which is a group of exceptions

[09:24] <jnthn> I pondered that X::Comp can carry an @.sorries and an @.worries

[09:24] *** cognominal left
[09:24] <jnthn> But that leaves questions like "so which do we pick as the one we throw if we have multiple @.sorries"?

[09:25] <moritz> but since @.sorries and @.worries are X::Comp's, that would be a whole tree

[09:25] <moritz> rather have an X::Comp::Group does X::Comp which holds them all

[09:25] <moritz> and then we can throw the Group

[09:25] <moritz> and it's message can join all of the @.sorries>>.message

[09:26] <jnthn> Well, STD gives them all a location message when dying too

[09:26] <jnthn> But yeah, to a first approximation, that.

[09:26] <moritz> then .message and the not-yet-there .locmess or whatever STD calls it

[09:27] <jnthn> Yeah, I did an equivalent of locmess last night

[09:27] <jnthn> (conveyed the surrounding context)

[09:27] <jnthn> Thing is, if we start throwing X::Comp::Group, what of all the tests?

[12:16] <cedrvint> I mean, why so many '(' ')'

[12:17] <cedrvint> what's on the right side of this feed operator?

[12:18] <moritz> cedrvint: where did you get that code from?

[12:18] <moritz> and does it actually work?

[12:18] <cedrvint> r:  1, 2 .. * ==> (*[0 .. 5])()

[12:18] <p6eval> rakudo e2f2dc:  ( no output )

[12:18] <p6eval> rakudo e2f2dc: OUTPUT¬´WhateverCode.new()‚ê§¬ª

[12:18] <moritz> that's a closure that does a slice index on its argument

[12:18] <grondilu> yeah you send an infinite list to a closure.  Should work.

[12:19] <cedrvint> moritz: from the advent calendar (problem 53)

[12:19] <p6eval> rakudo e2f2dc: OUTPUT¬´12..Inf‚ê§¬ª

[12:19] <moritz> and the () at the end invokes it

[12:19] <masak> looks like code that's being too clever for its own good, in any case ;)

[12:19] *** guest_____ left

[12:21] <cedrvint> moritz: thanks!

[12:21] <masak> grondilu: an advent calendar has one "thing" for each day, which is revealed during the days 1..24 of December.

[12:23] <masak> moritz: why does it invoke it? can't you just pass a closure on the rhs of a feed operator?

[12:23] <masak> moritz: also, your 'say' above seems mis-precedence'd.

[12:23] <masak> (it prints 1, 2 .. *)

[13:44] <GlitchMr> Doesn't he already have push access?

[13:45] <moritz> yes

[13:45] <moritz> which is why I was suprised to see a bunch of pull requests

[13:46] <GlitchMr> I was constantly getting new e-mails about that

[13:54] <cedrvint> are these two lines above equivalent?

[13:54] <GlitchMr> No

[13:55] <GlitchMr> *[^3] is sub {$_[^3]}. (*[^3])() is sub {$_[^3]}() (instantly called subroutine)

[13:55] <GlitchMr> ==> with subroutine doesn't make sense, but STD cannot know that

[13:55] <cedrvint> then I don't understand how (*[^3])() gets its parameters in:

[13:56] <cedrvint> r: 0, 1 ... * ==>  (*[^3])()

[14:02] <masak> cedrvint: I'm also suspicious of that code. I wonder if it's been properly tested.

[14:02] <phenny> masak: 03 Dec 23:27Z <japhb_> tell masak Regarding the halting problem intentionally avoiding Turing completeness, some years ago I administered a product called Lotus Notes, which was a groupware app with builtin scripting, databases, and replication (way ahead of its time, actually).  Anyway, scripts were executed on servers, not clients, so the scripting language intentionally disallowed any operation that could perform an explicit loop, but did have 

[14:02] <phenny> masak: 03 Dec 23:28Z <japhb_> tell masak (sorry, cut off by IRC): (e.g. all rows in a DB table); it was all to avoid runaway scripts taking down servers.

[14:03] <cedrvint> masak: I'm still confused :)

[14:03] <masak> japhb: wow.

[14:04] *** atrodo joined
[14:04] <masak> japhb: the very idea of "here, take this client code and run it on the server" sounds rather reckless these days.

[14:04] <masak> I bet I could think of some way or other to slow the server down, even without explicit loops...

[14:05] <GlitchMr> masak: I think it was from Perl 6 Advent Calendar

[14:05] <cedrvint> GlitchMr: thanks for your help, I'm missing something about the "instantly called", I guess.

[14:05] <[Coke]> eh. running code in a container/VM so you can only take down your container is still a strategy.

[14:05] <GlitchMr> gerdr has used ==> (*[0..100])() instead of [^101].

[14:05] <GlitchMr> Actually, not sure if he intended 101 numbers. 

[14:11] *** xinming_ joined
[14:13] <masak> actually, you could even design a FLooP-alike which enables recursion, as long as the programmer is forced to pass along one of moritz' "variants" as a parameter. i.e. a non-zero integer that strictly decreases with each recursive step.

[14:13] <masak> er, non-negative integer, I mean.

[15:22] <dalek> mu: Add myself to the advent calendar schedule

[15:22] <dalek> mu: review: https://github.com/perl6/mu/commit/42c51a36b1

[15:22] <hoelzro> I hope I don't regret this =S

[15:22] <PerlJam> hoelzro: we'll do our best to make sure you don't  :)

[15:23] <hoelzro> heh

[15:23] <masak> yay, all the slots are taken, except for 24. \o/

[15:23] <masak> TimToady, pmichaud, jnthn: who'll do 24? :D

[15:23] <PerlJam> yeah, except I still need to think of topics for 2 of my slots  :(

[15:24] <masak> PerlJam: if it helps, I usually like your posts a lot.

[15:24] <masak> write about something you like.

[15:24] <PerlJam> masak: and if that doesn't help?  :)

[15:25] <masak> PerlJam: quoting a musical I like: "count to 10... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10... and then... scream" :P

[15:25] <hoelzro> this is what I've got thus far: https://gist.github.com/4205120

[15:26] <masak> hoelzro: like Common Lisp, or C, or Ruby.

[15:26] <hoelzro> Ruby's a spec?

[15:26] *** aloha joined
[15:26] <masak> it has a test suite, at least.

[15:27] <masak> hoelzro: the "haz spec" thing is also unlike Perl 5, where the implementation is the spec. at some point there were several impls of Perl 5 (cf. oraperl), and it was very painful.

[15:27] <masak> that was Perl 4, even, I think.

[15:27] <moritz> though last I looked, ruby's test suite was orders of magnitude smaller than roast

[15:27] * masak must be careful not to call all pre-Perl 6 Perl versions "Perl 5" :)

[15:28] <masak> hoelzro: if I'm not completely wrong, Perlito targets more things than JavaScript.

[15:28] <hoelzro> oh, really?

[15:28] <hoelzro> I could always walk over to Flavio's desk and ask him =)

[15:28] * tadzik is amused with https://gist.github.com/4205148

[15:28] * moritz thinks masak isn't completely wrong

[15:29] <moritz> I think there's a perl5 backend too

[15:30] <masak> hoelzro: there's lots more to say about nqp, I think. first, it got new, better support. then it got 6model. then it got newer, betterer grammar support.

[15:30] <hoelzro> masak: I wanted to talk about NQP more, but I unfortunately don't know that much about it

[15:30] <PerlJam> hoelzro: you could also mention that Rakudo has been shifting to target just NQP and that NQP primarily targets Parrot, but there is the possiblity of other back ends there too.

[15:30] <masak> tadzik: cool!

[15:30] <tadzik> so now if I convince LWP::Simple to use a fake IO::Socket::INET I can make it non-blocking

[15:30] <masak> hoelzro: talking about the grammar engine and 6model as important parts of nqp is a good start, I belive.

[15:31] <tadzik> and marry it to MuEvent

[15:31] <masak> tadzik: \o/

[15:31] <tadzik> and we'll have something _a lot_ better than Perl 5

[15:31] <PerlJam> tadzik: I don't know ... Perl 5 has options.

[15:31] <tadzik> reminder: AnyEvent::HTTP is a 1500-line-long file which reimplements LWP

[15:31] <masak> hoelzro: the explanation of the name "roast" is that TimToady wanted to be able to tab-complete on the name, so we couldn't have both "specs" and "spectests" folders. :)

[15:32] <tadzik> :D

[15:32] <hoelzro> oh, good to know!

[15:32] <moritz> and the other is that we're not only spectesting, but also regression-testing

[15:32] <moritz> so we're roasting the implementations, and see what remains :-)

[15:32] <masak> hoelzro: yes, STD is canonical. we're also at the end of the "age of STD", it seems, where implementations are catching up and STD is getting less relevant with each day. it starts to hurt more and more that it *only* does parsing.

[15:33] <masak> there were a lot of silly backronyms for "roast", I think. none of them very good.

[15:34] <jnthn> It gives the implementations a good roasting, to make sure they aren't half-baked :P

[15:34] <PerlJam> masak: "age of STD" makes me think a Tolkienesque history of Perl 6 is in order at some point  :)

[15:35] <masak> PerlJam: well, I did write https://gist.github.com/2649172 about half a year ago... :)

[15:35] <masak> I was informed the ending didn't feel complete. I can only agree! ;)

[15:36] <PerlJam> masak++  :-)

[15:36] <tadzik> ===SORRY!===

[15:37] <moritz> we stole that idea from the 'clang' compiler

[15:37] <masak> tadzik: you might be the first one that actually triggered that in a non-testing setting.

[16:26] <tadzik> now, ain't that something :)

[16:26] <FROGGS__> new shiny tech? do I need to read backlog?

[16:26] <tadzik> just the last gist :)

[16:27] <tadzik> this isn't Coro-compatible, as Perl 5 Coro uses only cede, which works differently when in an async routine or outside it

[16:27] <tadzik> which could be hacked up :)

[16:28] <tadzik> I don't like the name "cede" though

[16:29] <FROGGS__> cool

[16:29] <hoelzro> tadzik: yield?

[16:29] *** nyuszika7h joined
[16:29] <awwaiid_> what hmm perl6 coro? hmmmm

[16:30] <tadzik> hoelzro: yeah, yield is the one inside a coroutine

[16:30] <hoelzro> oh, I see

[16:30] <tadzik> I now renamed it to sched9)

[16:30] <tadzik> ()

[16:30] <masak> tadzik: wow.

[16:30] <tadzik> now it looks like https://gist.github.com/4205836

[16:30] <masak> tadzik: what happens id you cede/sched one time too much?

[16:30] <tadzik> masak: just took care of that

[16:30] <masak> ah :)

[16:30] <tadzik> now, semaphores :>

[16:30] <PerlJam> tadzik++ neat

[16:31] <masak> tadzik: I'm not sure I prefer "sched" to "cede".

[16:31] <masak> "sched" is not a complete word.

[16:31] <tadzik> is "cede" a word?

[16:31] <masak> yes.

[16:31] <PerlJam> yes

[16:31] <tadzik> oh, TIL

[16:31] <tadzik> phenny: "cede"?

[16:31] <phenny> tadzik: "yields" (es to en, translate.google.com)

[16:31] <masak> it's quite similar to "yield", actually.

[16:31] <tadzik> ehehe

[16:31] <tadzik> okay

[16:31] <masak> tadzik: it means "to give up [something]"

[16:31] <tadzik> it's a Polish naive pronounciation of CD too

[16:32] <masak> in this case, to give up the control flow.

[16:32] <tadzik> it would probably be more friendly if yield() would work everywhere

[16:32] <awwaiid_> aptly used then :)

[16:32] <flussence> call it "pass", to annoy python users :)

[16:32] <awwaiid_> actually doesn't coro call it cede everywhere?

[16:33] <tadzik> it does

[16:33] <tadzik> flussence: ahahahaa

[16:33] <tadzik> cannot... resist...

[16:33] <jnthn> Is it possible to yield a value?

[16:34] <flussence> .oO( wouldn't that be gather/take? )

[16:34] <tadzik> can be made so

[16:34] <jnthn> :)

[16:34] <tadzik> flussence: that's the whole joke

[16:34] <jnthn> hah, if you call it pass then the documentation for doing it with a value can be, like

[16:34] <tadzik> it's just sugar

[16:34] <jnthn> pass 'wind';

[16:34] <jnthn> :P

[16:34] <tadzik> which amuses me a lot

[16:34] <tadzik> and thanks to jnthn I just found something that amuses me more :D

[16:34] <flussence> I'm slow today, must be the cold :)

[16:45] <PerlJam> switch on callframe results?

[16:46] *** daniel-s__ left
[16:46] <tadzik> yeah, I'm looking into it

[16:46] <tadzik> it fell odd tho, like "I shouldn't have to do this"

[16:46] <tadzik> or maybe I should :)

[16:48] <awwaiid_> with perl5 coro, I had to create a return value stack when implementing Coro::Generator, which implements a $my $new_arg_value = yeild($retval)

[16:58] <pmurias> tadzik: called from an inside a routine you could use a dynamic variable for that

[16:59] <tadzik> pmurias: nah, that doesn't quite work :|

[16:59] <tadzik> when the control flow jumps because of take, the dynamic variable reamins

[17:00] *** mjreed left
[17:00] * felher officially likes gather/take :)

[17:01] <felher> And therefore very much looks forward to tadzik post :)

[17:01] <pmurias> tadzik: if you jump out of a routine caller won't work either

[17:02] <tadzik> I'm beginning to realise that :|

[17:03] *** leont left
[17:04] <tadzik> I'll do it the easy way and maybe someone will come up with Magic later on

[17:04] *** fhelmberger left
[17:07] *** hoelzro is now known as hoelzro|away

[17:09] <masak> maybe you can save caller information in a dynamic variable somehow.

[17:09] <masak> tadzik: there's something to be said for keeping the old names of routines in Coro. some people will probably find them familiar.

[17:09] <pmurias> japhb: I try building nqp-js with the HEAD nqp maybe that will help

[17:11] <tadzik> masak: well, I even named it Coroutines rather than Coro, not confusing people being one of the reasons

[17:11] <masak> just suggesting that keeping names might also be a good thing. your decision.

[17:11] <tadzik> now neither of the available subs does the same as cede(), so I don't think it should be named cede()

[17:12] <tadzik> when I get the unified yield()/schedule() I'll consider it

[17:12] *** birdwindupbird left
[17:13] <tadzik> now I see that Coro used yield() in the early days, but in 0.1 Damian suggested cede() as a replacement

[17:14] <tadzik> I wonder what was the rationale

[19:17] <FROGGS> ya, you need something like a database to get the modules path, since the path cant handle these information

[19:18] <masak> FROGGS: no, S11 says modules posted on CPAN or entered into any standard Perl 6 library must.

[19:18] <FROGGS> but thats not ideal, since sometimes you install a binary, and want to put it in PATH

[19:18] <tadzik> easy

[19:18] <tadzik> we'll use FUSE

[19:18] <masak> FROGGS: the difference is important because there might be modules on disk which you might want to use but which didn't come from CPAN or some standard Perl 6 library.

[19:18] <FROGGS> masak: of course, thats true

[19:18] <FROGGS> FUSE?

[19:19] *** spider-mario joined
[19:19] <tadzik> Filesystem in Userspace

[19:19] <tadzik> we'll write a perl6 program that pretents to be a file system

[19:19] <tadzik> so when you ask for File/Find.pm it'll wonder what you mean by that, and supply different things based on other sources of information

[19:20] <tadzik> or... (and this time seriously)

[19:21] <tadzik> this File/Find.pm is not a real File/Find.pm but something that a module installer generated. It looks at the author you wanted, or version, and then knows where to look for them

[19:21] <tadzik> so the module itself cares, not the loading mechanism

[19:21] <tadzik> and modules aren't real, they're sort of proxies then

[19:21] <FROGGS> I wonder how that should work

[19:23] <FROGGS> example from S11: use Dog:auth({ .substr(0,5) eq 'cpan:'}):ver(Any);

[19:23] <tadzik> ewww

[19:23] <FROGGS> the easiest thing would be to have an index file/database that you can search for stuff like that

[19:24] *** mjreed left
[19:24] <FROGGS> and the real path to the module files (or its share dir) is then maybe like: lib/perl6/rakudo-1.0/Dog/cpan_JTPALMER/1.3.4/...

[19:25] <FROGGS> it will be "Dog" on the disk even if the module's name is "DÛg" or so

[19:25] <FROGGS> just that we can be sure it will be stored and it looks similar to the real module

[19:25] <FROGGS> .. or package or dist or whatever

[19:26] <masak> so we'll need a complete strategy for ASCIIfying module names.

[19:26] <GlitchMr> How can I slurp binary data?

[19:26] <masak> GlitchMr: the :bin argument on various I/O methods.

[19:27] <FROGGS> maybe its just a single dirname for the module, like Dog-cpan_JTPALMER-1.3.4-h876h8h6 <-- last is some sort of unique id

[19:27] <masak> .open has it, I know. maybe .slurp, too.

[19:27] <FROGGS> masak: ASCIIfying is easy IMO

[19:27] <masak> FROGGS: how do you ASCIIfy ‰Ω†Â•Ω?

[19:27] <FROGGS> whats its unicode name?

[19:27] <tadzik> D√≥g :)

[19:28] <[Coke]> masak;there's a module for that.

[19:28] <masak> .u ‰Ω†Â•Ω

[19:28] <phenny> U+4F60 CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4F60 (‰Ω†)

[19:28] <phenny> U+597D CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-597D (Â•Ω)

[19:28] <GlitchMr> Unidecode

[19:28] <GlitchMr> http://duckduckgo.com/?q=unidecode+%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD

[19:28] <masak> ok, as long as it's a solved problem.

[19:28] <FROGGS> hmmm

[19:28] <masak> I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here as best I can.

[19:28] <[Coke]> http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-0.04/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm

[19:28] <FROGGS> okay, chinese or what it is is a bit hard

[19:28] <FROGGS> .u Û

[19:28] <phenny> UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xf3 in position 0: unexpected end of data (file "/usr/lib/python2.6/encodings/utf_8.py", line 16, in decode)

[19:28] <masak> I want us to end up with a sane module handling. the less complexity, the better.

[19:28] <tadzik> .u √≥

[19:28] <phenny> U+00F3 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE (√≥)

[19:29] <tadzik> FROGGS: see, that's how you do this 

[19:29] <masak> FROGGS: check your client's encoding.

[19:29] <FROGGS> k

[19:29] <FROGGS> so Û would be a small o

[19:29] <masak> we hug trolls, but we dislike people who can't play by utf8 rules :)

[19:29] <tadzik> this should be named U+00F3 U KRESKOWANE

[19:29] <GlitchMr> It's not ACUTE

[19:29] <GlitchMr> ... or perhaps it is

[19:29] *** SamuraiJack left
[19:30] <[Coke]> masak: so, "NiHao"

[19:30] <GlitchMr> Well, sadly unicode doesn't have O WITH KRESKA character

[19:30] <masak> oh, you cute Polish people.

[19:30] <popl> that is an obtuse observation

[19:30] <GlitchMr> But ≈õ should be S WITH KRESKA

[19:30] <GlitchMr> .u ≈õ

[19:30] <phenny> U+015B LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH ACUTE (≈õ)

[19:30] <masak> [Coke]: oh, it actually does that? impressive.

[19:30] <GlitchMr> Unicode actually thinks that ACUTE is identical to KRESKA. It isn't.

[19:30] *** spider-mario left

[19:48] <tadzik> starting from small things, those "small steps" thingy we did in Oslo

[19:48] <FROGGS> so for now, I trying to figure out what would be needed to do everything the spec tells

[19:48] <masak> tadzik: yes, that's why I suggested the other day that we prototype this.

[19:49] <FROGGS> ya, if I dont have anything within the next days...

[19:49] <masak> tadzik: then we could play around with tests and requirements without being encumbered by an implementation.

[19:49] <FROGGS> masak: thats why I make some sort of test suite

[19:50] <GlitchMr> http://www.perlcabal.org:1337/

[19:50] <GlitchMr> December Wiki :-)

[19:50] <tadzik> GlitchMr: is that written in Perl 6?

[19:50] <GlitchMr> Yes

[19:51] <tadzik> the speed looks like it is :P

[19:51] <tadzik> awesome :) GlitchMr++

[19:51] <tadzik> now show the code :)

[19:51] <GlitchMr> Sure

[19:51] <GlitchMr> I'll upload it to GitHub soon

[19:51] <masak> GlitchMr: nice :)

[19:51] <PerlJam> GlitchMr: git-backed?

[19:51] <GlitchMr> Yes

[19:51] <masak> GlitchMr: may I suggest you use ISO dates rather than SHA-1s for the revision numbers? :)

[19:52] <GlitchMr> I will do it

[19:52] <GlitchMr> Currently I'm trying to implement basic functionality

[19:52] <masak> aye.

[19:52] <masak> just stood out as a simple improvement.

[19:54] <masak> speaking of nothing, what's the most malign thing that can be done with a page that accepts arbitrary HTML? :>

[19:54] <masak> I'm thinking things like XSS attacks...

[19:55] <GlitchMr> I know that you currently can use any HTML

[19:55] <GlitchMr> I don't have any language like MarkDown or HTML filter yet

[19:56] * masak adds a link to his blog

[19:57] <GlitchMr> https://github.com/GlitchMr/December

[19:57] <GlitchMr> Enjoy

[19:57] <flussence> "arbitrary HTML" includes arbitrary webgl code, which is a bit too close to root-privileged drivers for comfort...

[19:57] <tadzik> yeah!

[19:57] <masak> anyway, mad props to GlitchMr for this.

[19:57] <GlitchMr> It'

[19:57] <GlitchMr> It's very early

[19:57] <GlitchMr> I plan adding more features

[19:57] <masak> imagine if it had been this easy to make a wiki engine back in 2008 :)

[19:58] <flussence> .oO( is the next wiki going to be called "Smarch"? :)

[19:58] <GlitchMr> No, January ;-)

[19:58] <tadzik> hehe. It's ~80 lines of code

[19:59] <GlitchMr> But it works... somehow

[19:59] <GlitchMr> moritz has proposed December as name and I liked it.

[19:59] <GlitchMr> http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-12-02#i_6204609

[20:00] <GlitchMr> Why? Because it's 1) November++ 2) It was December

[20:00] <masak> oh, was that a proposal? I thought moritz cheered an already decided name :)

[20:00] <tadzik> :D

[20:00] <GlitchMr> Nope. It had lame name before that

[20:00] <GlitchMr> But I like December

[20:01] <tadzik> let's move the existing wiki to this wiki by the end of December

[20:01] <tadzik> er, by the end of december :)

[20:01] <colomon> Sorry to interrupt from GlitchMr++'s triumph, but does anyone have a quick way of making Rakudo accept non-UTF-8 files?  Or converting a non-UTF-8 file to UTF-8?  A "Malformed UTF-8 string" error from Rakudo is interfering with my $work....

[20:01] <GlitchMr> Well, the problem is it's slow

[20:01] <tadzik> you can always profile it :)

[20:02] <GlitchMr> Yeah, I also have problems with UTF-8

[20:02] <GlitchMr> Probably if somebody would inject invalid UTF-8 on my site, it would explode

[20:02] <tadzik> I'm confused with the Watching/Starring on github recently

[20:03] <masak> colomon: there's a tool called 'iconv'

[20:03] <GlitchMr> I just wanted a simple web app that actually would work

[20:03] <tadzik> this is great

[20:04] <tadzik> and is the best thing created with Bailador so far (that I know of)

[20:05] <GlitchMr> I had to actually modify Bailador to listen on public IP. By default, Bailador websites are only available locally.

[20:05] <GlitchMr> 0.0.0.0 is only available locally

[20:05] <GlitchMr> I have changed that to 0 and it works

[20:05] <tadzik> pull request!

[20:05] <tadzik> btw, I commented on the last one you sent

[20:06] <flussence> 0.0.0.0 means "bind to any address"... that should have worked.

[20:06] <GlitchMr> Yeah, that pull request is needed to for redirects to work on my Wiki. But I don't know how to make a test case.

[20:06] <colomon> masak++ # that seems to have done the trick, though the example command line I grabbed from saying "man iconv" in google didn't actually work in my machine's iconv.

[20:07] <tadzik> GlitchMr: I guess it'll be something with inspecting Bailador::Response

[20:07] <tadzik> or nos

[20:07] <tadzik> * not

[20:07] <tadzik> or yes

[20:07] <tadzik> yeah, obtain B::Response, check if .psgi is valid

[20:08] <tadzik> I can do that tomorrow evening

[20:08] <GlitchMr> Currently I'm trying to make Wiki more awesome

[20:08] <GlitchMr> Now to fix security issues

[20:09] <tadzik> a safe git wrapper would be nice

[20:09] <tadzik> as a separate project, probably

[20:09] <PerlJam> tadzik: funny enough, I was just contemplating writing a Perl 6 version of Git::Wrapper :)

[20:09] <tadzik> (:

[20:09] <GlitchMr> This wiki will use it after it will be completed

[20:10] <GlitchMr> Currently, I'm using lame escaping that only works in sh, really

[20:10] *** fgomez joined
[20:10] <GlitchMr> By the way, I've tried using run(), but it seems to cause SIGSEGV... looks I'll have to look into my code, because I was the one that has added run() to Perl 6.

[20:11] <tadzik> and looks like we need spectests :)

[20:13] <GlitchMr> perl6: say '<>&lamest>html&&escaper'.trans: '<>&' => <&lt; &gt; &amp;>

[20:13] <p6eval> rakudo e2f2dc, niecza v24-5-g599cbcb: OUTPUT¬´&lt;&gt;&amp;lamest&gt;html&amp;&amp;escaper‚ê§¬ª

[20:13] <GlitchMr> Seems to work... somehow

[20:14] <tadzik> don't we have urlencoder and decoder?

[20:15] <tadzik> oh, that's not the same thing

[20:15] <flussence> that's a bit harder :)

[20:15] <GlitchMr> URI::Escape is not work HTML

[20:15] <tadzik> yeah, it's a different stuff

[20:15] <GlitchMr> .trans: '<>&"' => <&lt; &gt; &amp; &quot;>

[20:15] <tadzik> html-entities, or something?

[20:15] <GlitchMr> Well, it's PHP quality...

[20:15] <GlitchMr> But still

[20:16] <flussence> it's not quite PHP-quality, you need to explicitly specify the string encoding there :)

[20:20] <GlitchMr> http://www.perlcabal.org:1337/%3Cb%3E

[20:20] <GlitchMr> ok, no XSS tehre

[20:20] <GlitchMr> Now only XSS is in articles themselves

[20:20] <GlitchMr> That could be more difficult

[20:21] <GlitchMr> uri_escape html <b>

[20:21] <GlitchMr> oops lol

[20:32] <GlitchMr> ok, logs on December now should show time

[20:37] <GlitchMr> But perhaps performance isn't that bad

[20:37] <GlitchMr> 0.8s for main page

[20:38] <masak> at some point, November had 9s for the main page.

[20:40] <GlitchMr> 0.8s is acceptable for me

[20:40] <GlitchMr> But logs for main page are REALLY slow

[20:40] <GlitchMr> well whatever

[20:41] <GlitchMr> It's possibly git

[20:41] <GlitchMr> 10 seconds

[20:41] <GlitchMr> Actually, I should check it myself

[20:41] <GlitchMr> Without Perl 6

[20:42] <GlitchMr> Nope

[20:42] <GlitchMr> 0.013 seconds to run command directly (without Perl 6).

[20:44] *** spider-mario joined
[20:44] <GlitchMr> oh, ok

[20:45] <GlitchMr> But there is a problem

[20:45] <GlitchMr> It requires me to quit process successfully

[20:45] <GlitchMr> But whatever, I will add quit command to wiki

[20:45] <tadzik> yep :)

[20:59] <GlitchMr> Because I don't see anything else

[20:59] <tadzik> hm

[20:59] <tadzik> I should implement constant folding in Template::Mojo :)

[21:00] <flussence> GlitchMr: depends on the length of the string, and the runtime...

[21:00] <tadzik> obtw, I'm quite sure Bailador recompiles the template every single time you run it :>

[21:00] <tadzik> sorry for that :)

[21:00] <GlitchMr> I know

[21:00] <GlitchMr> I actually abused that to test templates dynamically

[21:00] <GlitchMr> Without waiting for Perl 6 to load again

[21:00] <tadzik> haha, now I can say that it's a feature

[21:01] <GlitchMr> But seriously, I think it should cache templates

[21:01] <tadzik> it would be a nice thing, yes

[23:23] <japhb> phenny, tell GlitchMr Regarding SIGSEGV from run(), see Rakudo bug #115390 -- in my bench script, I've had to convert loops with multiple run() calls to multiple loops with only one run() call each (as the last statement in the loop block).

[23:23] <phenny> japhb: I'll pass that on when GlitchMr is around.
