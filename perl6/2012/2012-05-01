[10:19] <arnsholt> But ever since I tried to add my CStr repr to the build process, it complains about not being able to locate the nqp_dyncall_ops shared lib

[10:19] <jnthn> Hm

[10:19] <jnthn> That's...very odd.

[10:19] <moritz> arnsholt: what to paste the diff to Makefile.in?

[10:19] *** allbery_b left
[10:20] <arnsholt> Yeah. I'm thinking that it's not actually a failure to locate but a failure to load

[10:20] <arnsholt> I'm trying to rebuild without the CStr repr right now. I'll come back with the diff if it's still broken

[10:22] <colomon> anyone out there understand how #?DOES is supposed to work in fudge?

[10:22] *** allbery_b joined
[10:22] <moritz> colomon: there are two ways it can work

[10:23] <moritz> colomon: you can put it in front of a block, and do a #?impl skip 'reason'. Then it will skip as many tests as the number after #?DOES

[10:23] <moritz> colomon: or you can put it in front of a function. In which case fudge considers that function a normal test function like ok() or is(), and that it runs the specified number of tests

[10:24] <moritz> does t/spec/S02-magicals/env.t pass on current rakudo?

[10:25] <colomon> what I'm running into at the moment is that the value (at least using niecza's fudgeandrun) appears to be sticky

[10:25] <jnthn> Not here, but I thought that may be Windows specific.

[10:25] <colomon> that is, I say #?DOES 3 before a block, and every skip after that is getting marked as 3 tests.

[10:25] <arnsholt> There, I fixed it

[10:26] <arnsholt> Combination of two errors. One brain-dead copy-pasta, and one line I forgot to update in Makefile.in

[10:26] <moritz> jnthn: do Test::Util based tests run on windows now?

[10:27] <jnthn> moritz: yeah

[10:27] <moritz> \o/

[10:28] <jnthn> moritz: Mostly ones in the pod tests due to \r\n related parse issues

[10:28] <colomon> moritz: never mind, deleting the #?DOES commands I'd added and switching to the function version made it work beautifully.

[10:28] <moritz> colomon: good

[10:28] <jnthn> moritz: Can do a run now to see the full list

[10:30] <arnsholt> Heh. That makes me think of HTTP =)

[10:30] <jnthn> Yeah, that was kinda deliberate.

[11:09] <moritz> because of how we marshal parrot stuff to Perl 6 types

[11:09] <jnthn> We marshall return values from method calls.

[11:09] <jnthn> Don't think we marshall contextual lookups.

[15:28] <arnsholt> Yeah, that's what I thought, but I had a moment of doubt =)

[15:29] <tadzik> okay, I got stuff like $=DATA working. The problem is, the optimizer catches their usage before I construct them, so I have to do eval '$=DATA' :)

[16:04] <masak> lichtkind: a term is one "thing" in the code. like 42 or "OH HAI" or [1, 2, 3]

[16:04] <masak> lichtkind: an expression is a well-formed sequence of terms and operators.

[16:05] <PerlJam> mayhap I stretch the analogy

[16:05] <masak> terms are tightest-precedence in the op precedence table because they're like the "atoms" of code

[16:16] <TimToady> all we're doing is turning off the Perl 6 parser

[16:17] <jnthn> tadzik: The...optimizer is whining at you about undeclared variables?

[16:18] <PerlJam> TimToady: I vote N = 4 then

[16:18] <PerlJam> well,  N=3 for "more than"

[16:19] <TimToady> and it has to be where a pod directive is expected, I suppose

[16:19] <jnthn> tadzik: When is $=DATA being declared?

[16:19] <tadzik> jnthn: POd parser declares it

[16:19] <jnthn> Before we'd parse the say $=DATA ?

[16:19] <masak> TimToady: I agree about the stink.

[16:20] <tadzik> jnthn: er, I don't think so

[16:20] <TimToady> in that sense __END__ was an improvement on its successors

[16:20] <tadzik> it installs the lexical symbol after we're done parsing the file

[16:20] <tadzik> same for $=pod

[16:20] <masak> ===== could also be a merge garbage marker, but I guess we catch it at '<<<', so that should be fine.

[16:21] <TimToady> well, we could require more of 'em

[16:21] <jnthn> tadzik: Then it's too late.

[16:21] <jnthn> tadzik: It's not the optimizer

[16:21] <jnthn> tadzik: It's the same thing that catches:

[16:22] <jnthn> tadzik: er

[16:22] <jnthn> tadzik: I think I can guess actually and this is disgusting :)

[16:49] <PerlJam> TimToady: right.  and that seems reasonable to me.

[16:50] *** MContagious joined
[16:50] *** eviltwin_b left
[16:51] <TimToady> but a weird singleton pod directive feels rightish to me, and also resonates with the old __END__

[16:52] <PerlJam> indeed.

[16:53] <pmichaud> http://gist.github.com/2569584    # lines() is lazy, it's .map that is batching things up

[16:54] *** MContagious left
[16:55] <pmichaud>             my $munched := $!list.munch($argc * $count);

[16:55] <pmichaud> that's the problem line.

[16:56] <jnthn> That's also the line that made iteration performance in the "for 1..10000 { ... }" case an order of magnitude better, fwiw.

[16:56] <pmichaud> right

[16:56] <pmichaud> but obviously it's making .map not lazy

[16:56] <jnthn> Well, not lazy enough for this case, at least. :)

[16:57] <pmichaud> (this is at least one of the bugs I alluded to in the sunday afternoon "lists" session at the hackathon, fwiw. :-)

[16:57] <pmichaud> I can work on that today, I think.

[16:58] <jnthn> OK.

[16:58] <pmichaud> it's still on my mental "I really need to get that done" list

[16:59] <jnthn> Yeah, it's a pain point, for Rakudo and also for qbootstrap.

[16:59] <pmichaud> yes, I understand.  I'm not comfortable with letting it remain in the May release, if that's worth anything.

[16:59] <pmichaud> So, upper-bound is two weeks.

[16:59] <jnthn> wfm

[16:59] <jnthn> I've slowly chipping away at QAST.

[17:00] <pmichaud> jnthn++

[17:00] <jnthn> It already does at least one thing PAST never did. :)

[17:00] <jnthn> (natively typed register vars)

[17:01] <jnthn> One question I had. Do we use floating point anywhere in NQP?

[17:02] <jnthn> At the moment it seems everything gets done with Float PMCs.

[17:02] <pmichaud> basically all of the arithmetic and numeric relops use the __NN  opcodes

[17:03] <pmichaud> because .... those are the only ones available that can understand floating point :)

[17:03] <jnthn> Hm.

[17:04] <jnthn> Things are gonna get icky there, I fear.

[17:04] <pmichaud> I'm not exactly comfortable with saying that NQP should be an integer-only language

[17:04] <pmichaud> or even that it should default to ints

[17:04] <jnthn> I'm not exaclty proposing it :)

[17:05] <jnthn> It's more that we'll have a "my int $a" and "my num $b" distinction.

[17:05] <pmichaud> anyway, since parrot's notion of number tends to be "num" or "Float", that's what NQP generally ends up with

[17:05] <jnthn> We already do for natively typed attributes.

[17:05] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm worrying about "beyond Parrot" at this point. :)

[17:06] <jnthn> When I did the early NQP on the CLR port, I actually had it multiple-dispatching the operators.

[17:06] <pmichaud> well, it would be okay with me if NQP had a way of translating operators like  + - * /   into typed instructions

[17:06] <jnthn> I'm not sure I want to go there either though.

[17:06] <jnthn> I guess I'd be OK with static overloading.

[17:07] <jnthn> Taht is, if we see it's an int + and int, we just say "oh, use add_i"

[17:07] <pmichaud> at the time I was writing NQP, though, always using num was a way to avoid having to do a lot of type analysis in PAST and/or NQP

[17:07] <jnthn> Doing type analysis is easier once you have a type system. :)

[17:07] <pmichaud> (especially since it was going to be som..... exactly.)

[17:08] <jnthn> Anyway, making NQP an integer-only language felt odd to me, so if it doesn't feel right to you that probably confirms it's the wrong way. :)

[17:17] <PerlJam> tadzik: put the module name at the top and the description below it?

[17:17] <tadzik> patches welcome

[17:17] <tadzik> PerlJam: maybe, I don't know, I'm no HTML wizard :)

[17:18] <PerlJam> me either

[17:18] <tadzik> I only added those smoke testing badges

[17:19] <masak> sorear: thanks. again :)

[17:19] <masak> sorear: you're right, it was easy.

[17:20] <masak> TimToady++ spotted an URL that I hadn't tested properly, but that was the only real mishap.

[17:21] <colomon> Why is Smart::Match on the Perl 6 module wish list?

[17:22] <tadzik> I think I put it there

[17:23] <tadzik> I think it

[17:23] *** allbery_b joined
[17:23] <tadzik> 's quite nice, utilities like contains(), positive(), more_than() or whatnot

[17:24] *** oiig left
[17:24] <tadzik> maybe there are better ways, but it seemed nice when I looked at it

[17:26] *** MContagious joined
[17:26] <MContagious> can I know how to use perl -e (perl onliners)  to import module like in perl5 ?

[17:26] *** eviltwin_b left
[17:27] <tadzik> what do you mean? Like perl6 -e 'use Foo; something()'?

[17:28] <MContagious> we need to import modules in the actual code.. Is there a flag to import modules like -AM in perl5 ?

[17:28] <MContagious> sorry '-M'

[17:29] <PerlJam> MContagious: you want the perl6 equivalent to  perl -MFoo -e '...'  ??

[17:29] <MContagious> yeah

[17:29] <tadzik> I'm afraid there isn't any

[17:29] <PerlJam> perl6 -e 'use Foo; ...'  is it

[17:29] <colomon> tadzik: positive is just * > 0 in p6, more_than is * > $cutoff

[17:30] <jnthn> Though, moritz++ implemented -I earlier today. -M should be possible too :)

[17:30] <tadzik> colomon: okay, feel free to remove it then

[17:30] *** leprevost joined
[17:30] <colomon> tadzik: still not sure it's completely useless, mind you.  :)

[17:31] <tadzik> :)

[17:32] <tadzik> clearly not the Most Wanted thing

[17:32] <MContagious> jnthn:It will be cool if -M supported :)

[17:33] <masak> MContagious: I could easily write a shell script for you that emulates that ;)

[17:34] <tadzik> hey, it was supposed to be easier to port a shell than a shell script ;)

[17:35] <tadzik> also, it's particulary nice for perl -MCarp::Always::Color script.pl

[17:36] <MContagious> tadzik:yes

[17:38] <MContagious> it will be helpful to make modules like ExtUtils::Command

[17:41] <tadzik> http://tjs.azalayah.net/mpo.html updated

[17:41] <moritz> \o

[17:41] <tadzik> ExtUtils should be quite possible, as an extension of Shell::Command or something

[18:20] <arnsholt> moritz: Could you try that branch and nqp/cstr with your sqlite stuff? Hopefully it works now

[18:21] <tadzik> uvtc: if that was you, I'm not sure

[18:21] <uvtc> Ooooh, ahhh... I like the gemstone-looking check-boxen! Though, they don't go well with the other badges.

[18:21] <uvtc> tadzik, no, not me.

[18:21] <tadzik> yeah, in the end we'll probably need something else than icons stolen from KDE :P

[18:21] <tadzik> hmm, someone was telling me not to leave things just coloured, but also with symbols

[18:21] <uvtc> Hah. I'm not a KDE user. Didn't recognize them. There's gotta be some good free icons around.

[18:22] <uvtc> Right. Symbols for those with trouble seeing color, but color as well. Sounds good.

[18:22] <uvtc> To me, the graphics on the badges aren't all that recognizable.

[18:27] <uvtc> exciting

[18:29] <tadzik> :)

[18:30] <tadzik> maybe clicking the smoke badges could redirect to an appropiate emmentaler page

[18:30] <masak> sounds appropriate.

[18:31] <tadzik> that'll need some emmentaler extending too

[18:31] <tadzik> we'll see to taht

[18:31] <masak> two suggestions, and do with them what you will.

[18:31] <tadzik> go ahead

[18:32] <masak> (1) make the green checkmark boxes slightly less colorful. they're "uninteresting" in that they mark "everything's fine".

[18:32] <tadzik> right. The icons are temporary, or I hope so

[18:32] <masak> I quite like them, actually.

[18:33] <masak> (2) perhaps suppress further red cross checkboxes after the first one?

[18:33] <tadzik> the second one would be nice, indeed

[18:33] <masak> gives a bit of a spatial clue saying "we only really got this far".

[18:33] <tadzik> actually, I thought someone will contribute (hint hint) ;)

[18:33] <masak> not really. there's three boxes: green, red, and blank :)

[18:37] <goraki> rakudo question, is it correct that there must be whitespace between 'else' and the block that follows it? e.g. else{ … } causes an error?

[18:59] <moritz> role Roles[$param] { method param() { $param } }

[18:59] <arnsholt> Right. That was my other option

[19:31] <uvtc> Added this page to the mostly harmless docs: http://wiki.perl6.org/Mostly%20Harmless%20Docs/Files%20and%20IO . It uses the wiki's Perl 5 syntax highlighter.

[19:31] <uvtc> Also added a note to the front page about getting better Perl 6 syntax highlighting for the wiki.

[19:33] <uvtc> alester, I see the mostly harmless docs on the wiki http://wiki.perl6.org/Mostly%20Harmless%20Docs/Main as being somewhat similar to your http://perl101.org/ .

[19:42] <alester> I have email, too.

[19:42] <uvtc> gotcha.

[19:42] <alester> I haven't done anything on perl101 in forever.

[19:43] <uvtc> Right. But when I saw your nick, I thought of perl101 and then made the connection.

[19:43] <alester> I'm not sure I ever will.  But who know.

[19:44] <uvtc> I just had phenny ping you because I figured, if I don't hear back from someone, it probably won't hurt to have phenny let them know when they get back.

[19:44] <alester> understood.

[20:11] <uvtc> How do I print to stderr? I tried `say $*ERR $err-msg;` but that's not it...

[20:12] <masak> uvtc: 'note $err-msg'

[20:12] <uvtc> Oooh. I think I saw "warn" mentioned somewhere as well.

[20:12] <masak> uvtc: or '$*ERR.say: $err-msg'

[20:12] <uvtc> Ok.

[20:13] <masak> uvtc: &warn throws a resumable exception, which then gets printed to STDERR when caught.

[20:13] <masak> or rather, when nothing catches it and silences it :)

[20:17] <masak> yes, it should get to bye, and it does.

[20:18] *** brrt left
[20:18] <uvtc> masak, I only ask, because you mentioned "resumable exception", but I never caught any exception.

[20:18] <masak> the runtime catches it, and resumes it.

[20:18] <masak> that's what warnings are: milder forms of error after which stuff continues on.

[20:19] <uvtc> Ok, will get back to understanding that better after learning about p6 exceptions.

[20:19] <uvtc> thanks, masak.

[20:20] <uvtc> Is there any way to make `say` non-buffered? That is, write directly to stdout, without delay.

[20:20] *** NamelessTee left
[20:22] <moritz> it already is non-buffered

[21:02] <masak> (`leg` is to `le` and `ge` as `<=>` is to `<=` and `>=`)

[21:02] <uvtc> masak, right.

[21:03] <masak> though the corresponding `cmp` comparison operators aren't called `cm` and `pm`, they're `before` and `after` :)

[21:07] <uvtc> masak, you mean, it ripples through a data structure, recursively, checking corresponding pieces for equality?

[21:08] <uvtc> Interesting. I'd've guessed that it would check if two objects are the same object.

[21:08] *** eviltwin_b left
[21:08] <masak> that's part of what === does.

[21:08] <uvtc> Does eqv use eq or ==?

[21:09] <masak> p6: say 42 eqv "42"

[21:09] <masak> seems eqv uses === underneath.

[21:09] <uvtc> What does `===` do?

[21:09] <masak> compares reference identity.

[21:10] <masak> unless it's been told the thing is a value object (like numbers and strings and stuff), then it compares values.

[21:10] *** geekosaur left
[21:10] <uvtc> What does eqv use when comparing one item in one data structure to the corresponding item in the other d-s? eq or ==?

[21:11] *** geekosaur joined
[21:11] <masak> ===

[21:11] <masak> which boils down to reference comparison, eq, or ==, depending.

[21:12] <uvtc> masak, regarding using ===, I don't see how that would work, unless the implementation is sharing fragments of data structures behind the scenes.
