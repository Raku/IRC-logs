[08:56] <diakopter> if I can find/discover an appropriate scalable queue lock, I can get rid of 5million failed CAS/s

[08:58] <bonsaikitten> why is the locking needed? (iow, are lockless algos maybe useful here?)

[09:00] <diakopter> the "lock" is really just access to the memory each wants to CAS. So, to remove contention on that location, a queue lock can be used. it's for implementing a lock-free algorithm

[09:01] <diakopter> heh.

[09:02] <diakopter> well hmm, never mind, seems I confused myself there again.  a queue lock wouldn't help. sry nm

[09:03] <diakopter> but I need something to reduce CAS contention. simple exponential backoff is helping a little, but it's constraining throughput

[11:57] <grondilu> ^ what dyou think about this, guys?

[11:58] <grondilu> I know it's not a big problem but it's kind of annoying me each time I have to chose a name for an array variable.

[11:59] <cognominal> grondilu, where are you living?

[11:59] <grondilu> France.  Why?

[11:59] <cognominal> near Paris?

[12:00] <grondilu> No.  I left Paris a few months ago.  I live in Picardie, now.

[12:00] <cognominal> do you know the mongueurs?

[12:00] <grondilu> Not much.

[12:00] <cognominal> ha, too bad.

[12:01] <cognominal> I have seen you are taking over the French wp article about Perl 6. that's good because I have not updated it much the last few years

[12:03] <cognominal> there is some crap (about history mostly) added by well intentionned people I did not  remove to not discourage further collaboration that did not materialize. I hope you will be more drastic than I was.

[12:05] <cognominal> grondilu, there is a french channel #perlfr on irc.perl.org

[12:52] <FROGGS> the tests in roast are helpful too about $=pod (DATA)

[18:13] <diakopter> o/

[18:13] <[Coke]> quiet today. jnthn must be recuperating after filling up the changelog. :)

[18:14] *** bluescreen10 joined
[18:15] <PerlJam> Maybe everyone is busy writing posts for the 2012 Perl 6 Advent Calendar ...

[18:16] * jnthn spent most of the day resting, since last night's headache turned into an everythingache by this morning.

[18:21] <[Coke]> fluish?

[18:22] <jnthn> I seem to lack any other flu symptoms.

[18:23] <PerlJam> The dreaded oldage virus?  :)

[18:24] * masak .oO( jnthn? old? ) :P

[18:26] <jnthn> Yeah, seems a bit early for that one :P

[18:31] <masak> old age doesn't hit until 28 or 29... :)

[18:32] <huf> that age is certainly the "oldest"

[18:32] <huf> in the sense that they complain most about being old

[18:32] <huf> at least in my experience :)

[18:32] <PerlJam> It's all downhill after age 25 ... luckily the downslope is quite a bit shallower than the upslope

[18:32] <daxim> iunex with 30 (or 32 when counting base 2), senex with 60 (or 64)

[19:28] <masak> a person has sent me an email in my role as "an author of a web-master program writen in perl6".

[19:29] <jnthn> The word "web-master" is still used? :)

[19:29] <masak> he's planning to write a web application (in Perl 6) that uses mysql.

[19:29] <masak> he's asking about prior art and whether anything in my program is stealable.

[19:29] <masak> (not sure if he's referring to November or psyde, but nevermind)

[19:29] *** Chillance left
[19:30] <masak> I have half a mind to just refer him to http://github.com/tadzik/zblog -- any other suggestions?

[19:30] *** Chillance joined
[19:30] <tadzik> well, źblog is hardly a good example of a proper web application :)

[19:31] *** colomon joined
[19:32] <tadzik> but probably is a short, useful example

[19:32] <masak> it's small. it uses Bailador and DBIish. it works.

[19:33] <tadzik> true

[19:36] * masak sent a short, working reply :)

[23:44] <p6eval> rakudo f81716: OUTPUT«(("a", "b", "c", "d"), "ab cd")␤»

[23:46] <felher> Not what i expected. Is this correct?

[23:46] <felher> r: << a b c d e 'ab cd' >>.tree>>.say

[23:46] <p6eval> rakudo f81716: OUTPUT«ab cd␤a b c d e␤»

[23:47] <sorear> not really correct but not really wrong either

[23:48] <sorear> .tree is one of those "I know what I'm doing" buttons

[23:48] <sorear> I don't think you're supposed to care about parcel layout except in some specific cases, like zip operators

[23:49] <felher> sorear: okay, thanks :)
