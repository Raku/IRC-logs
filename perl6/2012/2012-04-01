[11:50] <masak> hm, mystified by the following: PAST::Val, and a bunch of other well-known PAST node types, don't seem to have a definition anywhere within the perl6/nqp repository.

[11:51] <masak> are PIR and nqp flexible enough that they recognize a namespace even if it hasn't been declared anywhere?

[11:51] <masak> and if so, what handles all the PAST::Val.new and PAST::Val.ACCEPTS calls everywhere?

[11:52] <moritz> masak: I think they are inside the parrot repo

[11:52] <moritz> masak: compilers/pct/src/PAST/{Node,Compiler}.pir

[11:56] <masak> ah. 'course.

[11:56] <masak> moritz++

[11:56] <masak> the ability to re-open any namespace from any PIR file constitutes a very "powerful" feature ;)

[11:57] <masak> but it's no worse than Perl 5, I guess.

[11:57] <moritz> aye

[11:58] <masak> ah, yeah. this is the stuff.

[12:02] *** PacoAir joined
[12:08] <masak> looks like the contents of compilers/pct/src/PAST/{Node,Compiler}.pir, plus some things from the nqp repo's src/PAST/NQP.pir, make up what would need to be ported to QAST.

[12:08] <masak> it's code describing the node layout, and a bunch of as_post methods to compile PAST nodes to POST.

[12:15] <masak> heh, Java 7 allows the syntax "catch (IOException|SQLException ex) {" to avoid having to repeat the same catch clause with only the exception type differing.

[12:15] <masak> Java 7 also introduces 0b binary literals.

[13:46] <[Coke]> I also am experience feather networking issues this past week or so.

[13:48] <leont> FYI: http://bioperl.org/pipermail/bioperl-l/2012-April/036407.html

[13:49] <tadzik> seems legit

[13:50] <leont> I'm not sure what to think about it though

[13:50] <tadzik> he could have posted it on a better date :)

[13:50] <tadzik> and, TPF is not on gsoc anyway :/

[13:50] <leont> But Open Biology Foundation is ;-)

[13:51] <tadzik> oh, nice :)

[13:51] <masak> "implement Bioperl in Perl 6" sounds like a larger task than a GSoC task.

[13:51] <leont> s/Biology/Bioinformatics/

[13:51] <leont> masak: exactly

[13:51] <masak> mind you, one might get off to a good start.

[13:51] <leont> I mean, I'm sure perl6 is learnable in that amount of time, but I do assume that takes time too

[13:52] <masak> I'd advise this person to get into contact with #perl6 ASAP.

[13:52] <leont> I'm not sure how much useful stuff one would get done

[13:52] <leont> Yeah, and #bioperl tooÖ

[13:52] <masak> indeed, learning Perl 6 is not instantaneous. though it's quicker to learn with today's documentation than with last year's.

[13:53] <tadzik> well, is it?

[13:53] <masak> learning to write *idiomatic* Perl 6, which one would perhaps expect from a project like this, takes more than a summer :)

[13:53] <masak> ...but then again, "good start" and all that.

[13:53] <masak> with TDD and refactoring, most projects can be lifted from the limitations of an initial design and faltering first steps of implementation.

[13:54] <leont> Well, it's important to get foundations right for a project like this before people depend on it

[13:54] <leont> BioPerl is scary Perl 5 from the mid-late 90s

[14:00] <leont> Also, BioPerl as a whole is more than 2000 modules. You can't reimplement that with a dozen GSOC students. It would be fairly minimal in that regard.

[16:34] * masak , with totally undiminished enthusiasm for IRC-ing in a moving vehicle

[16:35] <masak> moritz: I was thinking "macros" also, when I read your complaint above. I think the interesting question, though, is: can it be done with *AST* macros?

[16:36] <masak> and if not, which primitives are we lacking that would allow that?

[16:36] <moritz> we'd need to be able to add holes into identifiers

[16:36] <moritz> but a textual macro would work in that simple case

[16:38] <masak> sure it would. I'm just looking for ways to extend the niche of AST macros at the expense of textual macros.

[16:38] <lichtkind> can you tell me about that failong subtest about loading?

[16:42] <lichtkind> i think i will also ask so question about postcircumfix and alike, while this is easy there are other cat i not quite understand

[16:48] <Araq> what's perl6's way of providing genSym?

[16:48] <lichtkind> what is gensym?

[16:49] <Araq> a way to introduce a unique symbol for hygenic macros

[16:51] *** wolfman2000 left
[16:53] <lichtkind> and by symbol you mean a operator?

[16:53] <Araq> by symbol I mean symbol

[16:54] <Araq> identifier

[16:55] <lichtkind> we have hygenic macros

[16:55] <Araq> good

[16:55] <Araq> how do they work?

[16:55] <lichtkind> http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/macros-what-are-they-really

[16:55] <lichtkind> a short overview

[17:03] <masak> that blog post doesn't really address gensymming, though.

[17:04] <lichtkind> yes but it explains that macros produce an ast

[17:04] <masak> Araq: the short and slightly unsatisfactory answer is that careful separation of lexical scopes replaces gensymming in Perl 6.

[17:04] <lichtkind> and this gets weaved into the  program ast by compiler

[17:04] <masak> at least by our current best understanding.

[17:05] <masak> lichtkind: right, but there are lots of subtleties, starting with the fact that an AST must have a "context" much like a closure does.

[17:06] <masak> Araq: at the end of http://masak.org/carl/gpw-2012-macros/talk.pdf there is an elucidation about how the lexical scopes conspire to make gensymming unnecessary.

[17:07] <masak> unfortunately, there is no audio track with the PDF :) please ask more if things are not clear.

[17:20] <masak> o/ Ronja :)

[17:20] <moritz> I wonder why the wikipedia page on hygienic macros doesn't mention careful scoping as a solution

[17:20] <moritz> \o

[17:20] <masak> that struck me as odd too.

[17:20] <masak> maybe it won't work :P

[17:21] <masak> or maybe Wikipedia has, I dunno, some sort of omission.

[17:22] *** s1n joined
[17:23] <moritz> if it works, it seems indeed to be the cleanest solution

[17:25] <masak> aye.

[17:25] <masak> when I get to the point where it works in Rakudo, I might add the alternative to the list in the article ;)

[17:30] *** leont joined
[17:32] *** mucker left
[17:39] <Araq> what is the alternative, masak?

[17:44] <masak> well, let's make an example to make things concrete.

[17:44] <Araq> careful scoping is no substitute for gensym

[17:45] <masak> macro foo($x) { quasi { my $a = 1; say $a; say {{{$x}}} } }; my $a = 2; foo($a)

[17:45] <masak> there are two variables called '$a' -- the one in the quasi block, and the one in the mainline.

[17:46] <masak> generally, we'd need to gensym the one in the quasi block so that it won't collide with the one in the mainline.

[17:46] <masak> but not in Perl 6.

[17:47] <Araq> yeah but what if the macro wants to inject a new variable that is destructed at scope end (C++ like RAII)?

[17:47] <masak> we generally handle destruction at scope end with a LEAVE phaser.

[17:48] <masak> though it's still a little unclear to me which block the LEAVE phaser latches on to -- the quasi block, or the block in the mainline.

[17:49] <masak> seems to me we would want it to latch on to the block in the mainline at least sometimes. this would imply that phasers in quasi blocks are "deferred" until macro application time, just like type declarations etc.

[17:52] <masak> as to variable injection in general (with or without RAII), see the discuission on the COMPILING:: namespace in S06.

[17:53] <Araq> link?

[17:53] <masak> COMPILING:: grants you a kind of "un-hygiene", even for declarations if you want.

[17:53] <masak> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S06.html#Macros

[17:54] <masak> it's just that hygiene is switched on by default, because we think it's a nice default :)

[17:55] <lichtkind> tadzik: while isntalling panda i got use of uninitialized value of type Command in string context

[17:55] <tadzik> lichtkind: yeah, I know. I have no idea where that comes from :)

[17:55] <masak> and gosh, I sure hope that careful scoping *is* a substitute for gensymming. :) but maybe we were talking past each other, because there certainly are ways in which it wouldn't be in other languages. in Perl 6, it is.

[19:03] <tadzik> did you tackle the freenode riddle today?

[19:03] <masak> heh. I thought I needed a dynamic variable in a module, but it turned out I just needed a lexical variable in that module. I wonder what made me confused in that particular way.

[19:04] <masak> seems to me now that dynamic variables are mostly useful in situations that resemble traversal, or recursion.

[19:06] * masak de-trains

[19:09] <moritz> masak: agreed about recursion and dynamic vars

[19:11] <moritz> or what STD.pm6 and rakudo's Grammar.pm use is to do some tiny bits of configuration on the calling location for stuff that goes deep into the call stack and that isn't worth passing around as objects all the time

[19:18] <lichtkind> masak: whos idea was it to lowercase pod?

[19:20] <sorear> damian is impossible to get rid of!

[19:20] <lichtkind> here it is a good thing :)

[19:20] <Araq> implicit parameters seem a better solution than dynamic vars

[19:21] <sorear> Hi ! Haven't seen you fo a while

[19:21] <Araq> well thanks, hi

[19:22] <lichtkind> tadzik: only reason for me was it just looks better ebcasue special var have to stick out more and if pod do it too there is tto much uppercase and since is got even more part  of the lang it should be lowercase like rest of keywords

[19:59] <timotimo> mhm, mhm.

[19:59] <timotimo> my rakudo doesn't complain if i just type "next", but i suppose there's a subtle difference between its repl and p6eval that causes this?

[20:00] <tadzik> supposedly

[20:00] <tadzik> REPL is probably just a loop, so next is likely to just work :)

[20:00] <timotimo> oh, haha :D

[20:00] <timotimo> that makes sense

[20:01] <timotimo> yup, typing last makes the repl quit

[20:01] <timotimo> that's amusing :)

[20:02] <tadzik> :)

[20:02] <tadzik> I like the feeling when something happens to work exactly the way you imagined it would

[20:02] <timotimo> i've got that surprisingly often with perl6 so far

[20:04] <spider-mario> I can confirm that

[20:05] <spider-mario> hopelessly writing some code, running it

[20:05] <spider-mario> and ‚Äúwhat, it actually works?‚Äù

[20:05] <timotimo> still, the amount of different "stuff" that one has to know to be good at perl6 (probably the same for perl5) is huge when compared to python, which is what i spent most of my time with in the last years

[20:06] <Araq> hu? bugs in the REPL are intuitive?

[20:06] <timotimo> python has much less syntax, most things that would have syntax in perl6 would have a function in python instead

[20:06] <spider-mario> I guess being fluent at Perl¬†6 can take you further

[20:07] <timotimo> i feel the same way, spider-mario, that's why i want to learn :)

[20:08] <timotimo> Araq: it's intuitive that if the repl is just simply a repl, that the control exceptions you'd cause with "next" or "last" would cause the rep-loop to react

[20:09] <timotimo> i guess fixing that is a simple matter of adding a CONTROL block in the rep-loop to complain about control exceptions coming from the eval statement without being handled

[20:11] <lichtkind> is there a .add method?

[20:12] <Araq> timotimo: I got that, just sayin'; it *is* a bug, albeit a minor

[20:12] <tadzik> lichtkind: add what to what?

[20:13] <timotimo> sure

[20:18] <tadzik> \o/

[20:19] <bbkr> tadzik: the point is that NativeCall cannot fallback to .dylib, it always wants .bundle, so I have to hardcode it until https://github.com/jnthn/zavolaj/issues/7 is resolved

[20:20] <tadzik> I see

[20:20] <bbkr> tadzik: after that i will remove also hardcoded path and it should work on any OS

[20:20] <tadzik> I have a feeling there's a need for a mechanism which will make it easier to resolve things like this in modules

[20:22] *** birdwindupbird left

[20:24] <tadzik> possibly something along "use Alien; sub foo is native(Alien::lib<foolib>)

[20:25] *** brrt left
[20:27] <bbkr> Native Call does it. is native("libGeoIP") works if I recompile library to .bundle on OS X and works also on Linux with .so files.

[20:29] <tadzik> oh, I see

[20:30] <bbkr> so NativeCall is only "one issue away" from being truly multiplatform :)

[20:30] <tadzik> I'm afraid the issue lives in nqp

[20:31] <tadzik> or even in a dyncall library

[20:33] <bbkr> I'm not experienced enough to debug this one on my own. If jnthn will reject issue on NativeCall repo I will report in NQP :)

[20:34] <tadzik> I'm quite sure it's dyncall which lacks this

[20:34] <Araq> what's NQP?

[20:34] <tadzik> 3rdparty/dyncall/buildsys/bsdmake/osx.bsdmake

[20:34] <tadzik> 29:DLL_SUFFIX= .dylib

[20:34] <timotimo> not quite perl, it's the language in which a lot of rakudo is written

[20:34] <benabik> Araq: Not Quite Perl, the subset of Perl 6 that Rakudo is implemented in.

[20:34] <tadzik> Araq: Not Quite Perl, a subset of Perl 6 in which the core Rakudo is implemented

[20:35] <tadzik> oh wait, that's unrelated

[20:35] <tadzik> (dynlib)

[20:35] <Araq> a static subset of perl6?

[20:35] <benabik> Araq: It's not static, the object system is just simpler.

[20:36] <Araq> so it's quite unlike PyPy's implementation language?

[20:37] <tadzik> bbkr: does dlopen("foo") Just Work for .bundle in OSX?

[20:37] <tadzik> I think it's just dlopen() doing the hard work after all

[20:38] <lichtkind> so damian said no reason

[20:40] <bbkr> tadzik: DLL_SUFFIX lies :) NativeCall wants to fetch .bundle by default

[20:40] <tadzik> bbkr: yeah, that DLL_SUFFIX was for building dyncall itself

[20:40] <tadzik> bbkr: does `man dlopen' on OSX say anything about suffixes?

[20:41] <tadzik> bbkr: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/3rdparty/dyncall/dynload/dynload_darwin.c#L54

[20:41] <tadzik> it seems that it's just doing dlopen(), no magic

[20:41] *** constantined left
[20:43] <bbkr> dlopen only mentions it can "can load dynamic libraries and bundles", nothing about suffixes

[20:46] *** brrt joined
[20:48] <masak> moritz: yeah, dynamic vars turn into a kind of couterweight to long parameter lists in recursion/traversal contexts. sort of the same trick as nesting subs and using outer vars, but in time rather than in space ;)

[20:53] <masak> lichtkind: lower-casing pod was part of the whole TheDamian/tadzik/jnthn/pmichaud/masak hallway discussion at YAPC::EU 2011.

[20:54] <masak> lichtkind: IIRC, Damian seemed to think that a variable like $=pod wasn't extraordinary enough to merit uppercase.

[20:54] <tadzik> I was probably against this :P

[20:55] <tadzik> If I wasn't I'd probably implement it right away to please Damian :)

[20:55] <masak> well, you didn't prevent TheDamian from making the change then, or me from committing it later ;)

[20:55] <tadzik> who am I to stand against you ;) Especially you Both

[20:55] <masak> lichtkind: if you look at the commit I linked you to, you'll notice that a few things got lower-cased.

[20:56] <lichtkind> yes i did

[20:56] <masak> tadzik: I'll disregard the implication that I somehow posess Damian-like powers :P

[20:56] <lichtkind> im mostly woth tadzik in this

[20:56] <lichtkind> but i like the way it looks

[20:56] <lichtkind> it just doesnt feel right syntactically

[20:56] <Araq> you know, there is this thing called "case insensitivity"

[20:56] <masak> well, both of you have write access to S26, I presume.

[20:56] <tadzik> masak: why do you think I *still* haven't turned #= into #|? :P

[20:56] <masak> Araq: :D

[20:57] <masak> tadzik: that one *must* be laziness, though, because that's an improvement ;)

[20:57] <Araq> it was a pretty good idea back in the days

[20:57] <lichtkind> what is #= ?

[20:57] <tadzik> masak: I still don't like this :)

[20:57] <masak> lichtkind: buddy, you're in for a treat :)

[20:57] <Araq> but then unfortunately unix did win 

[20:57] <tadzik> masak: but I didn't oppose very loud for I have no better idea

[20:57] <tadzik> but again, I think having two kind of special comments is too much

[20:57] <masak> Araq: I suddenly get the feeling you're not joking.

[20:58] <masak> Araq: could be trolling, though.

[20:58] <Araq> and now people think it's a feature that they need to care about details like that ...

[21:00] <masak> spider-mario: yes, it is. see the STD output.

[21:00] <tadzik> still. Go lives with just prefix-ish '//'. I think we _could_ live with just one kind of comment

[21:00] <tadzik> and I'd prefer that one to be #=, like $= in $=pod

[21:01] <tadzik> once I'll get a good idea, then actually implement it so you can't touch me and re-spec it agin

[21:01] <tadzik> ahahaahaha!

[21:01] <Araq> MASAK: no, not you, the uppercased one

[21:01] <Araq> ;-)

[21:01] <masak> tadzik: please please please prepare a spec patch, and we can talk over it.

[21:02] <tadzik> masak: what I mean (or think), is that we probably don't need two kinds of doc-comments

[21:02] <tadzik> but to prove this, I'd have to present a working solution

[21:02] <masak> Araq: feels to me in a very short while you've conflated case-insensitivity of (a) file names, (b) variable names, (c) IRC nicks. this does not help your argument.

[21:02] *** snearch joined
[21:03] <masak> tadzik: all you need to present is a sufficiently clear S26 patch.

[21:03] <tadzik> masak: I'd prefer to be sure that it'll make sense :)

[21:03] <Araq> which argument? I have not even given an argument yet, just an example

[21:03] <tadzik> so far it's mostly "I think this would be the easiest way" discussion

[21:04] <Araq> an argument would be something like "psychology has proven that most if not all people remember the sound of a word, and not its spelling"

[21:04] <tadzik> I'm thinking of having a "look, I got this working and it's the best" ace in my hand

[21:05] *** crappyguy joined
[21:05] <masak> tadzik: good. I think the spec shouldn't remain in a state where the guy implementing it feels uncomfortable.

[21:06] <sorear> tadzik: I'm pretty sure th having two kinds of doc comments thing was my idea; I stole it from Haddock

[21:06] <masak> and if it all moves in the direction of increased simplicity (which my changes did too, by the way!), all the better.

[21:06] * tadzik looks up Haddock

[21:06] <masak> yeah, I remember the discussion starting around Haddock and its up/down doc comments.

[21:06] <benabik> Two kinds of doc comments?

[21:07] <tadzik> yeah, #= and #|

[21:07] <masak> benabik: one sitting before a declaration, the other after it.

[21:07] <benabik> Oh, how odd.

[21:07] <tadzik> Haddock is a food fish.

[21:07] <tadzik> Captain Haddock, a cartoon character in the The Adventures of Tintin series

[21:07] <tadzik> duckduckgo is awesome

[21:07] <benabik> tadzik: Haddock is a documentation system for Haskell

[21:07] <masak> it's also a Haskell documentation standard.

[21:07] <tadzik> yeah, I see

[21:08] <sorear> Once upon a time, S26 had only one #= comment, and S26 had disambiguation rules that rivalled P5's implicit object syntax in confusingness

[21:08] <tadzik> that's correct

[21:08] <lichtkind> ah so its a comment that ends in $=pos?

[21:08] <masak> yeah. that's why I said that my changes were a simplification.

[21:08] <lichtkind> ah so its a comment that ends in $=pod?

[21:08] <tadzik> "you can put #= before, after, or somewhere else and the compiler will be smart"

[21:08] <tadzik> lichtkind: not really. It ends in the object being documented

[21:08] <tadzik> see my example above

[21:09] <masak> I'm assuming tadzik doesn't want to take us back to disambiguation land ;)
