[09:19] <bonsaikitten> isn't any product from Microsoft automatically tagged like that?

[09:20] <bonsaikitten> (and their best acronym by far was WIX, which translates roughly as WANK from german)

[09:20] <tadzik> well, C# is quite nice

[09:21] <jnthn> Aye. The Visual Studio debugger is also very nice

[09:22] <tadzik> yeah, it's not bad

[09:22] <tadzik> I only touched it a little during my Windows Forms uni project

[09:22] <tadzik> didn't have time to learn it properly, so I did the same thing that I did with Java

[09:23] <bonsaikitten> tadzik: java++ ... what you'd expect with a decade of experience from java

[09:24] <tadzik> well, when I had to write a Java project I just wrote C++ untill it stopped compiling, then I looked stuff up

[09:24] <bonsaikitten> I don't like the family of java-ish languages, they have so much redundancy in their redundant redundancy

[09:24] <tadzik> now I was writing Java, and when it was not working I was looking for the C# way ;)

[09:25] <tadzik> but this one has first-class functions, so it's the most pleasant one

[09:28] <jnthn> I once considered C# "just another Java", but then they added type inference and lambdas and lazily evaluated pipelines, then suddenly it was a lot more pleasant.

[09:31] <bonsaikitten> for me it's still a no-go because it doesn't run on any of the platforms I support

[09:32] <jnthn> That's fair enough.

[09:34] <grondilu> bonsaikitten: same here

[09:35] <bonsaikitten> amusingly I still need java and windows ... for taxes

[09:35] <bonsaikitten> someone didn't get the memo, I guess?

[09:42] <jnthn> C# just happens to be really popular here in Sweden. Most of the dev teams I work with at various companies use it.

[09:42] <jnthn> And not because I explicitly seek it out. Typically I'm there to deal with architecture level issues.

[09:43] <jnthn> But knowing the implementation langauge they're using well can't hurt. :)

[12:11] <tadzik> jnthn: yeah, the case of plugging-in to panda builder somehow

[12:11] <tadzik> I should have a branch or such which tries to implement it, but stumbles upon a rakudobug of sort

[12:12] <tadzik> I don't think I reported that one :/.

[12:28] <jnthn> If it lets us get le debugger installable through Panda I'd probably be quite motivated to fix it :P

[12:29] <jnthn> colomon: Type "help" for a list of the commands :)

[12:29] <jnthn> It tells you all it can do :)

[12:29] <colomon> jnthn: I was just going to go back and look at your Advent post again.  :)

[12:31] <jnthn> That also gives a fairly practical overview.

[13:19] <brrt> can any polish person help me out here?

[13:19] <brrt> my colleagues suggest that racism is prevalent in poland, and for this reason they want to censor images containing coloured people

[13:20] <hoelzro> http://blog.angryasianman.com/2009/08/photoshop-fail-microsofts-polish-site.html

[13:20] <brrt> is this true?

[13:20] <brrt> oh my god

[13:20] <brrt> it is true

[13:20] <hoelzro> haha

[13:20] * hoelzro is not Polish

[13:20] <tadzik> phenny: en pl "prevalent"?

[13:21] <phenny> tadzik: "rozpowszechniony" (en to pl, translate.google.com)

[13:21] <tadzik> oh

[13:21] <hoelzro> well, I'm not from Poland. I'm Polish by ancestry, though

[13:21] <tadzik> well, I don't think I agree

[13:21] <tadzik> (being Polish)

[13:21] <brrt> i cannot imagine

[13:21] <hoelzro> I just remember that example from a while ago =)

[13:21] <hoelzro> and found it pretty funny

[13:21] <huf> i wouldnt censor anything to appease racists 

[13:21] <brrt> well, its funny until you are asked to do it

[13:21] <huf> but if poland is anything like hungary, then racism is endemic

[13:22] <huf> and i'd expect less fortunate societies to be more racist

[13:22] <huf> so post-soviet republics are in peril

[13:22] <tadzik> there are hardcore nationalists propagating racism, but it's a minority, and the same kind of people are everywhere

[13:22] <huf> but that's all i know :)

[13:22] <brrt> so

[13:22] <tadzik> I have plenty of black people on my university, nobody cares

[13:22] <huf> tadzik: oh sure, maybe it's not against blacks :)

[13:23] *** marloshouse left
[13:23] <tadzik> I didn't hear of anything like "censoring images" besides this one stupid microsoft case

[13:23] <huf> in hungary, lots of people are racist againt blacks, but the level of racism is nothing compared to what chinese or the roma get

[13:23] <huf> .. or jews

[13:23] <tadzik> and, tbh, I'm not quite surprised with microsoft move

[13:23] *** marloshouse joined
[13:23] <huf> yeah, that was really weird

[13:23] <tadzik> it's stupid and funny, but it's all about targeting specific group of people

[13:24] <tadzik> even Cialdini says, that we're more likely to like people which are like us

[13:24] <tadzik> (like like like)

[13:24] <tadzik> if you target an advertisment at housewives, you put a housewife in the advert

[13:24] <huf> well yes

[13:24] <tadzik> if you target white businessmen...

[13:25] <tadzik> I don't think targeting black businessmen in Poland would be economically...

[13:25] <tadzik> phenny: "uzasadione"?

[13:25] <phenny> tadzik: "uzasadione" (pl to en, translate.google.com)

[13:25] <tadzik> very helpful

[13:25] <tadzik> phenny: "uzasadnione"?

[13:25] <phenny> tadzik: "justified" (pl to en, translate.google.com)

[13:25] <tadzik> yes, this

[13:25] <tadzik> ...simply because we have little to none of them

[13:26] <brrt> tadzik, even white businessmen live in a world where people come with all varieties of skin pigmentation

[13:26] <tadzik> of course

[13:26] <brrt> it is bizarre to pretend otherwise, especially in 2012

[13:26] <tadzik> but would you force 4 kinds of skin colours on one ad just for the sake of not being accused of racism?>

[13:27] *** sjn_ is now known as sjn

[13:27] <brrt> no, i would take natural photos

[13:27] <brrt> as they are

[13:27] <brrt> these people are clearly not polish, either, are they?

[13:27] <tadzik> iow: I'm not surprised that they used 3 white people on the Polish ad, but since they actually photoshoped american ad, well, they're asking for being accused

[13:27] <a_b_c> Hi there, is the ''N' in "s:nth(N)" can be counted from the end? Such as nth(-1) 

[13:27] <brrt> if you are an international company and want to present yourself as such

[13:27] <brrt> you better be honest about it

[13:28] <tadzik> I don't disagree that it was a stupid move :)

[13:28] <huf> tadzik: if you're making an ad in polan for poland, sure, leave out the blacks

[13:28] <tadzik> right

[13:28] <huf> but if you're just importing a foreign ad, ... oh come on

[13:28] <moritz> a_b_c: I don't think so

[14:43] <moritz> sounds like you have an old version of panda installed already

[14:43] <moritz> in that case, try rebootstrap.pl

[14:43] *** cognominal joined

[19:35] <GlitchMr> But it seems to be right

[19:35] <GlitchMr> If I would compare it with "upowszechniać"

[19:35] <Woodi> but upowszechniac is :)

[19:35] <Woodi> u- is prefix too :)

[19:36] <Woodi> but that prefixes do not seems to be operators...

[19:37] <GlitchMr> Well, in Polish language prefixes are complex. Actually, I'm not sure if there's any rule to those.

[19:37] <arnsholt> Prefixes tend to be complicated in general

[19:38] <arnsholt> In English for example, there are some prefixes that are relatively productive, but only with certain stems

[19:38] <arnsholt> (Because of hysterical raisins, of course)

[19:39] <Woodi> but they are usefull, eg. save time, allow talk less :)

[19:40] <FROGGS> it would be good if there are rules for that, so that you can create new words

[19:40] <GlitchMr> Even "nie-" is complex. Usually it means negation of something.

[19:40] <GlitchMr> But there are words like "nienawidzić". Polish doesn't have "nawidzić".

[19:41] *** xenoterracide joined
[19:41] <arnsholt> In Latin there's a class of movement verbs, all with different prefixes derived from a root word that is no longer used =)

[19:41] <GlitchMr> Perhaps it had in the history, not sure, really.

[19:41] <arnsholt> Most likely the root word fell out of use but the derived form stayed in use

[19:43] <arnsholt> The Latin ones I mentioned are still in use in English too: progressive, ingressive, egressive, and so on

[19:43] <arnsholt> All derived from a root verb gredior which isn't actually used in Latin

[19:44] <arnsholt> Although, now that I talk about it, it would be neat if the unprefixed variant was attested in something like Oscan or Umbrian

[19:44] <GlitchMr> Also, those special cases. Natural languages are full of those. Like сорок that means 40 in Russian.

[19:45] <FROGGS> {advent calender}++ # this might help me with my import problem for my module SDL

[19:47] <arnsholt> GlitchMr: Why is that weird?

[19:47] <GlitchMr> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/сорок

[19:47] <GlitchMr> See "See also"

[19:48] <GlitchMr> Other X0 numbers actually follow a rule.

[19:48] <GlitchMr> Except for девяносто... is 4 special or what?

[19:48] <masak> GlitchMr: oh! I had forgotten about сорок! thanks for reminding me :)

[19:48] <masak> GlitchMr: I was so flummoxed the first time I learned that word. :D

[19:49] <tadzik> сорок sounds like kopa

[19:50] <arnsholt> Right, now I see. That is weird

[19:51] <arnsholt> Possibly a Turkish loan. Cool

[19:51] <GlitchMr> Actually, kopa is like 5 dozens.

[19:51] <FROGGS> well, in german language the 11 and 12 are weird, the others follow a plan

[19:51] <GlitchMr> "Tuzin" in Polish

[19:52] <FROGGS> ... and I thought a dozen is 12

[19:52] <GlitchMr> Because it is

[19:52] <GlitchMr> I have said, 5 dozens - 5 tuzinów.

[19:53] <FROGGS> ahh, kopa, not copok

[19:53] * masak .oO( a dozen is 12 unless you're a baker )

[19:53] <FROGGS> masak?

[19:53] <Woodi> hmm ? baker ?

[19:53] <GlitchMr> So, do you mean elf and zwölf. Yeah, that's odd to me too.

[19:53] <tadzik> elf-cwelf

[19:53] <FROGGS> GlitchMr: right, because dreizehn is 3=drei + 10=zehn

[19:54] <GlitchMr> I know ;-)

[19:54] <masak> FROGGS: nono, сорок, not copok. :D

[19:54] <FROGGS> thats the only oddity I can think of

[19:54] <tadzik> m?

[19:54] <tadzik> ww, sorry

[19:54] <FROGGS> masak: whatever ;o)

[19:54] <masak> FROGGS: they're not even close!

[19:54] <masak> .u кk

[19:54] <phenny> U+043A CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER KA (к)

[19:54] <phenny> U+006B LATIN SMALL LETTER K (k)

[19:54] <GlitchMr> masak: if you want to go with Latin, use sorok.

[19:55] <FROGGS> just three pixels on my screen difference

[19:55] <GlitchMr> But Cyrillic is preferred - сорок.

[19:55] <masak> GlitchMr: thank you for informing me of how Cyrillic is pronounced. this would have been very useful for me in certain situations, such as severe memory loss.

[19:55] <masak> :P

[19:55] <GlitchMr> Well, it isn't that easy

[19:56] <masak> oh, it's pretty easy, once you know how.

[19:56] <masak> I'll give you a quick run-through some day.

[19:56] <GlitchMr> о is spelled differently depending on accent

[19:56] <masak> o rly?

[19:56] <tadzik> :D

[19:56] <GlitchMr> IPA: [ˈsorək]

[19:57] <FROGGS> thats spocks father, is it?

[19:57] <tadzik> SPOILER ALERT

[19:57] <GlitchMr> With accent, о is spelled like o, otherwise it's spelled like ə.

[19:57] <tadzik> oh, no, I've seen that one I think :)

[19:58] <GlitchMr> Or if we map to Cyrillic, о without accent is spelled like а.

[19:58] <GlitchMr> .u а

[19:58] <phenny> U+0430 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A (а)

[19:58] <GlitchMr> "sorok" was transliteration

[19:58] <FROGGS> masak: klingon is a nice language btw, if these pre- and suffix are fun for you

[19:59] <masak> GlitchMr: was gonna say. isn't the unstressed о pronounced more like [a]?

[19:59] <GlitchMr> Yes

[19:59] <masak> GlitchMr: also, after learning Cyrillic, all transliterations look a bit sad and insufficient.

[20:00] <masak> because Cyrillic is really good at capturing the Russian sounds.

[20:00] <masak> and transliterated Latin isn't.

[20:00] <tadzik> go figure :)

[20:00] <GlitchMr> Oh, and accent is moving in Russian. For сорок, the accent is on first о.

[20:00] <masak> GlitchMr: "stress is nondeterministic" :)

[20:01] <masak> GlitchMr: "accent" doesn't mean what you think it means.

[20:01] <GlitchMr> False friends ;-)

[20:01] <GlitchMr> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend

[20:01] <GlitchMr> But right, I think I should've used stress.

[20:01] <GlitchMr> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/akcent

[20:02] <masak> it's the same false friend in Swedish.

[20:03] <masak> hm, no. never mind.

[20:24] <FROGGS> japhb: the reason that I would just append numeric uids (1..n) is because the auth can be a url or samething, you cant put that in a path... So you cant trust the path/filename anyway and you must use the manifest

[20:28] *** ifim joined
[20:32] <japhb> FROGGS, we had discussed mapping URL -> path in a lossy way, but taking advantage of the fact that in actual use collisions of the lossy-mapped auth are likely to be rare.

[20:43] <jnthn> Then the module in lib is just a normal thing.

[20:43] <tadzik> yeah

[20:43] <jnthn> Depends on Term::ANSIColor

[20:43] <tadzik> that's the part that doesn't work :)

[22:55] <flussence> is there a trick to installing rakudo git so that I don't have to update my $PATH every time the parrot version changes? :/

[22:55] <japhb> diakopter, re: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-12-05#i_6216009 , a few years back I saw an add for a screen saver that supposedly detected the keyboard patterns of a cat on the keyboard, and flashed the display and made loud noises to try to shoo the cat away.

[22:56] <japhb> tadzik, re: https://github.com/tadzik/panda/commit/ce829d76f5#L0R41 , should that be unshift instead of push (and later shift instead of pop)?

[22:57] <sorear> use a webcam to detect cats approaching the keyboard

[23:00] <jnthn> Thing is, cats already know they're cute enough to get away with anything :)

[23:01] <japhb> FROGGS, re: https://gist.github.com/4223775 , I like the power you implying, though I'd definitely want a quieter default (all that info is more than a little verbose!).  As for the 'activate' command (which I read as similar in concept to Debian alternatives), I've been letting that basic idea simmer in the back of my head for a few days and I'm beginning to think A) it's not *quite* that simple, and B) nevertheless we need something like

[23:01] <japhb>  it.

[23:03] *** benabik joined
[23:04] <japhb> TimToady, regarding packaging and zipballs and such, I'm beginning to think that (for the specific case of a git repo holding the source), a release really just needs to be a revish.  A tag is of course easy for humans, but any revish will do.

[23:05] <japhb> So then the question is what kind of build procedure happens on install, and if it destroys all that fun revish info.

[23:06] * japhb wonders if really we want to see through the commit/tag to the git tree object
