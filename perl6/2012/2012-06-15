[03:39] <adu> hi moritz

[05:20] *** tyatpi joined
[05:20] <adu> btw, this is around when I sleep, I'm just delaying the inevitable

[05:23] <Woodi> pmichaud++: slies with startup times was just shocking :)

[05:24] <Woodi> if rakudo/niecza perform well in similiar benchmarks vs ruby|python we should call Perl6 "OOP language of choice for everyone" :)

[05:25] <adu> Woodi: I still think we need a JVM impl

[05:25] <Woodi> -adu-: I still think we NEED C imp :)

[05:25] <adu> well JVM and X86

[05:26] <Woodi> and perl6 build into browsers without JS :)

[05:26] <adu> there are lots of things in Perl6 that I think most C compilers wouldn't be able to pick up on

[05:26] <adu> Woodi: hahaha like dart?

[05:27] <adu> like how x86 has a strchr instruction (in a matter of speaking)

[05:27] <Woodi> yea, replace JS :)

[05:28] <Timbus> replace it with a bytecode already

[05:28] <adu> I don't think the world can agree on bytecode

[05:28] <adu> JS was hard enought for the world to agree on

[05:28] <Timbus> i never agreed to it

[05:29] <Timbus> :[

[05:29] <Woodi> -adu-: new C++ standard and maybe C too gives few features for use in Perl6 compiler

[05:29] <adu> neigher did I but JS is much better than C imho

[05:29] <Timbus> of course

[05:29] <adu> Woodi: I was thinking about about to compile Perl6 to C++ just yesterday

[05:29] <adu> perhaps it's a common thought

[05:30] <adu> because no one should ever manually, intentionally write C++

[05:30] <Timbus> i keep telling myself to try to port nqp to llvm and then see who will help me make a 'lakudo'

[05:30] <Timbus> but then i remember i have a full time job :(

[05:30] <Woodi> -adu-: for many programs it will be enought but sometimes you need to include v6 parser...

[05:30] <adu> Timbus: I was also thinking about a PBC to LLVM compiler

[05:31] <adu> you guys are inside my head… stop it!

[05:31] <adu> :)

[05:31] <Woodi> hmm, interesting...

[05:31] <Timbus> pbc to llvm was something many have thought of but.. i think it needs to break away from parrot entirely

[05:31] <adu> PBC => M0 => LLVM?

[05:31] <Timbus> parrot is great and all but, parrot sucks.

[05:32] <adu> Timbus: please explain

[05:32] <sorear> adu: I am awake.

[05:32] <Woodi> lets invent shared programming language for teams... :)

[05:32] <Woodi> then chinase army can do good work :)

[05:32] <Timbus> the idea is great, the motive of interop is great, also the compiler tools are great (well they used to be..)

[05:32] <adu> I just heard from someone in #osdev that Parrot sucks because of TLB cache misses and register spills and RAM rollbacks, and some such technobabble

[05:32] <Timbus> but the implementation is slow, the bits are rotting

[05:33] <Timbus> i feel the project lacks motivation i guess.

[05:33] <adu> I think someone should re-engineer Parrot

[05:33] <adu> I'm motivated

[05:33] <Woodi> for me parrot is at least two things: libperl6-reinvented and VM...

[05:33] <adu> and I have time

[05:34] <adu> I am in love with Parrot and Perl6

[05:34] <Timbus> aw cute

[05:34] <adu> for me Parrot should be an interface, but perhaps that's what M0 was supposed to be

[05:34] <Timbus> id prefer if you riupped out the good bits of paarrt and mixed them into llvm

[05:34] <adu> :D

[05:34] <sorear> adu: I suspect whoever you talked to in #osdev has no relevant recent experience with Parrot

[05:34] <adu> sorear: probably

[05:35] <sorear> it sucks, but not for those reasons

[05:35] <adu> o

[05:35] <adu> and I have a karma of 10 :)

[05:36] <adu> which is why you should vote for adu to lead the Parrot steering committee

[05:37] <adu> sorear: why do you think it sucks?

[05:37] <Timbus> i also think parrot doesnt know what it's for. it has pmc's but you are meant to make your own. it has a huge set of opcodes that no one uses? im not too sure on this but I also believe it has multidispatch that rakudo doesn't even use... and does it even need to be built on continuations?

[05:37] <Timbus> then again i havent used parrot in over a year so

[05:37] <adu> Parrot seems pretty nice to me, lots of builtins, somewhat documented, and extensible (both dynops and dynpmc's whatever they are)

[05:38] <sorear> Timbus: continuations are one of parrot's best points imo.

[05:38] <sorear> far too many application VMs force a stack paradigm

[05:38] <adu> but there is one thing that seems missing

[05:38] <adu> threads

[05:38] <Timbus> i thought parrot got green/hybrid threads of some sort

[05:38] <adu> Timbus: I think threads were implemented as dynops

[05:38] <adu> i.e. not core

[05:39] <sorear> core vs not is a complete red herring

[05:39] <moritz> the reasons that parrot is slow is 1) calling conventions that produce too many objects which the GC has to consider and 2) lack of a JIT

[05:39] <adu> ok

[05:39] <adu> what do I know

[05:39] <adu> i've only been in this chat room a month

[05:39] <moritz> adu: everything shipped with parrot is 'core', basically

[05:40] <sorear> what does matter is that the thread implementation Parrot has settled on involves 1. memory cannot be shared between threads 2. message queues 3. transparent proxy objects

[05:40] <Timbus> im worried about 1

[05:40] <sorear> it's extremely... policy

[05:40] <Timbus> please tell me its not like perl 5

[05:40] <sorear> in the mechanism vs policy sense

[05:40] <Timbus> oh good

[05:40] <adu> moritz: I was just reading about LuaJIT, maybe we could use some of those ideas in Parrot?

[05:41] <moritz> adu: it's not lack of ideas that's holding back JIT on parrot

[05:41] <adu> sorear: sounds reasonable

[05:41] <sorear> Timbus: it's not like perl 5 at all!  you see, parrot will have transparent proxy objects to hide the heap split

[05:41] <adu> sounds a lot like Go

[05:42] <adu> with thread-local default

[05:44] <sorear> Timbus: I should stop talking now

[05:44] <Timbus> :L

[05:45] <moritz> adu: parrot seems to be down to just a handful of regular contributors, many of whom just do small fixes here and there but lack enough tuits to attack the central problems

[05:45] <Timbus> did i miss your carsasm

[05:45] <moritz> well, rakudo also just a handful of regular contributors

[05:46] <moritz> but still, feels like more visible progress

[05:46] * moritz -> afk

[05:46] <adu> I've been working on grammrs (p6-xml, and p6-go) because that seems to most well documented to be, but perhaps I should work more on parrot

[05:46] <sorear> everything seems like more progress if you're in the middle of it.

[05:46] <adu> s/be/me

[05:47] <sorear> adu: you are free to spend your time however you wish.

[05:47] * tadzik ponders a thought of recording his pronounciation of "niecza" and putting it somewhere

[05:48] <tadzik> good morning folks

[05:48] <sorear> I am feeling that it is not my place to give advise

[05:49] <adu> tadzik: Niecza = nee-EH-cha, Rakudo = RAH-koo-DOH

[05:49] <sorear> us customary phonologies suck.

[05:49] <adu> tadzik: I must be dreaming ;)

[05:49] <sorear> I mean, phonological writing

[05:49] <sorear> far too ambiguous

[05:50] <adu> sorear: would you prefer IPA?

[05:50] <tadzik> adu: "niecza" is completely unambiguous for me

[05:50] <tadzik> however you write unambiguous

[05:50] <sorear> adu: if I said that I'm about equally likely to say ニエッカ or ニエッチャ, would that help? :D

[05:51] <sorear> adu: IPA would be awesome.  Unfortunately, I have not yet learned it.

[05:51] <adu> sorear: yes, in fact

[05:52] <adu> katakana is my second language

[05:52] <adu> ɾakudo, nietʃa

[05:52] <adu> I think that was IPA

[05:53] <sorear> however, since it is constructed from Polish word fragments, I consider tadzik to be more correct than myself on this

[05:53] <sorear> adu: ISTR you saying you were Japanese

[05:53] <adu> sorear: no, I was born in Florida

[05:53] <adu> I grew up in Japan, that's all

[05:54] <sorear> oh.  military kid?

[05:57] <sorear> adu: do I have to be f***ing crazy to attend YAPC::Asia in Tōkyō?

[05:57] <huf> adu: :)

[05:57] <sorear> adu: or is this only a residency classification?

[05:57] <adu> I fell into tha last 2 categories

[05:58] <adu> sorear: well, travelers are pretty crazy

[05:58] <sorear> (actually, this might be moot, because if I'm entirely lucky my visits to YAPC::Asia will be as a Swede)

[05:58] <adu> I've never spent any sizable amount of time in tokyo

[05:58] <adu> most of my life in Japan was in Osaka

[05:58] <tadzik> a Swede?

[05:58] <bonsaikitten> hrm, that sounds like a nice excuse to visit japan

[05:59] * sorear wonders how well adu can cope with kanji

[05:59] <adu> sorear: I know about 200 kanji off the top of my head

[05:59] <sorear> tadzik: a citizen of Sweden.  masak really, really wants to hire me

[05:59] <adu> sorear: literacy requires 1800 kanji

[05:59] <sorear> adu: about the same as me

[06:00] <adu> sorear: sugoi

[06:00] <sorear> (I think I'm closer to 300, but that's not particularly useful)

[06:06] <tadzik> no, to Sweden

[06:10] <sorear> hmm, probably ～新しくされなくちゃ～ better

[06:11] <sorear> my vocabulary is as bad as my kanji repertoire

[06:11] <adu> "やれる物" might be translated as: job, wife, or whore

[06:12] <sorear> I was trying for skills D:

[06:12] <adu> haha

[06:12] <adu> sorear: it means "that which you do"

[06:14] * sorear tries 知っている単語は知っている漢字にように少ないです。

[06:18] <adu> given the words you know and the kanji you know, converting between them doesn't always work?

[06:18] <sorear> I was practicing words earlier today and can't get my de:Sprach to stop rhyming with en:crack

[06:19] <adu> hahaha

[06:19] <sorear> de is my highest priority to learn currently

[06:19] <adu> ok

[06:19] <moritz> sorear: why?

[06:20] <moritz> sorear: oh :-)

[06:20] <moritz> sorear: /join #perlde on irc.perl.org :-)

[06:21] <sorear> moritz: I want to get the sounds straight before I start reading practice

[06:22] <sorear> moritz: I probably will, sometime in the next few weeks :)

[06:22] <adu> sorear: Sprechen Sie deutsch?

[06:22] <bonsaikitten> sorear: "ch" in german is not a "k" sound ... 

[06:23] <bonsaikitten> actually in some parts of switzerland every K is a ch :)

[06:24] <moritz> kcwu: I'm pretty sure sorear is aware of that ("can't get [...] to stop")

[06:24] <moritz> sorry, meant bonsaikitten 

[06:24] <moritz> wow, how did I mis-tab a 'b' to 'k'?

[06:24] <sorear> bonsaikitten: I know!  My mom says it right, but when I try to imitate her, it just sounds like retching.

[06:24] <bonsaikitten> konsaibitten? ;)

[06:24] <bonsaikitten> sorear: so you can speak dutch properly ;)

[06:25] <bonsaikitten> the dutch "g" is about the hardest sound to reproduce

[06:25] <moritz> the konsai was bitten?

[06:25] <bonsaikitten> that's why I prefer flemish, it's a lot more "flat"

[06:25] <adu> bonsaikitten: I disagree, I think the Farsi "q" is the hardest

[06:25] <sorear> bonsaikitten: I'd lose my voice pretty quickly if I had to mock retch for every 'ch'

[06:25] <bonsaikitten> adu: hmm. maybe. I lack references to compare

[06:25] <adu> you basically have to pretend you're choking for 1/10 of a second

[06:26] <adu> Farsi is a dialect of Arabic

[06:26] <bonsaikitten> what about the clock sound found in some african languages?

[06:26] <sorear> mm, esophogeal plosives?

[06:26] <bonsaikitten> click, not clock. stupid fingers!

[06:26] <moritz> sounds are best learned below the age of 6 or so, but with proper instruction can be learned later too

[06:27] <moritz> but clocks make click sounds!

[06:27] <sorear> moritz: finding 'proper instruction' seems non-trivial

[07:20] <tadzik> melatonin, heh. I was taking this drug for some time in my life :)

[07:22] <bonsaikitten> tadzik: good results?

[07:23] <tadzik> bonsaikitten: suprisingly, yes. I was sleeping normally for the first time in my life, and I stopped taking the pills after 2 or 3 years and I tend to sleep normally most of the time now

[07:24] <tadzik> unless I purposedly stay awake all night to do something

[07:24] <bonsaikitten> tadzik: hmm, that is quite beneficial

[07:24] <tadzik> but it's still better than it was

[07:24] <tadzik> which one?

[07:24] <bonsaikitten> well, I sleep normally too, jus tthat I run at offset of +4h to local time

[07:24] <tadzik> heh

[07:25] <tadzik> I sometimes sleep at n+1 offset

[07:25] <tadzik> so, one hour later each day

[07:25] <tadzik> but that's when I really stay up all night

[07:25] <sorear> now that I'm not having to put up with classes, I'm toying with the idea of getting back on biphase

[07:25] <tadzik> well, if you know what I mean

[07:26] <bonsaikitten> tadzik: I tend to do that until daylight "catches" me

[07:26] <bonsaikitten> then I sometimes do 22h days to rewind

[07:26] <tadzik> sorear: did it work for you?

[07:27] <bonsaikitten> I spent most of last year biphasic, that was nice

[07:27] <tadzik> the idea sounds quite good, but I feel that my sleeping habits are too fragile even for normal, monophasic sleep

[07:28] <sorear> tadzik: yes, it worked

[07:28] <bonsaikitten> I can stay stable monophasic *if* I am allowed to sleep when I'm tired

[07:29] <sorear> wooh, success

[07:30] <sorear> with Ich and Sprach

[07:30] <tadzik> :)

[07:30] <moritz> now sorear just needs to learn that 'Sprach' isn't a German word :-)

[07:30] <tadzik> is that the same 'ch'?

[07:30] <tadzik> I though Ich is more like Iś

[07:30] <moritz> yes

[07:31] <tadzik> but it's possible that Sprechen is actually Spreśen :)

[07:31] <moritz> ('Sprache' would be correct, for 'language' or 'speech')

[07:31] * moritz doesn't know how tadzik pronounces ś

[07:31] <sorear> :-) 1 hurdle down, N-1 to go.

[07:32] <tadzik> moritz: like in Sośnierz :)

[07:32] <sorear> I'll probably just stick with tad zick to start

[07:32] <moritz> it's the same soft ch that the Scottish use for 'loch' and such lovely words

[07:32] <tadzik> it works for most people

[07:32] * sorear wonders if that is a German z

[07:32] <tadzik> the trick is that 'dzi' is actually one sound

[07:33] <shachaf> moritz: What's the soft ch? Is it the same as the one in my name?

[07:33] <sorear> moritz: I never correctly said 'loch' before today either :-)

[07:33] <moritz> shachaf: I don't know how you pronounce your name either :-)

[07:33] <shachaf> Voiceless uvular fricative.

[07:33] <sorear> Sprache is velar

[07:34] <sorear> Ich is palatal

[07:34] <sorear> voiceless fricatives, though

[07:34] * moritz didn't know that the two ch's were pronounced differently :-)

[07:34] <shachaf> Ugh, velar fricatives.

[07:34] * shachaf tends to hear things as uvular.

[07:35] <shachaf> I also usually think that "alveolar trills" are uvular.

[10:55] <tadzik> English question, pardon me: "the more documents a term occurs in, the less discriminating it is." What does the "discriminating" mean in this context?

[11:17] <timotimo> tadzik: i would think discriminating means "helpful in deciding what is meant"

[11:17] <timotimo> like "the blue car" would be discriminative if you're standing in front of ten differently colored cars, but if you're on a field with a hundred blue cars, it's not particularly discriminating

[11:18] <pmichaud> my rental car here is blue

[11:19] <pmichaud> like, *blue*

[11:19] <tadzik> so it has a similar meaning to "significant in a given context?"

[13:42] <PerlJam> What's the problem exactly?

[13:42] <PerlJam> (or should I read scrollback?)

[13:43] <UncleFester6> invoke() not implemented when generating NQPCORE.setting.pir

[13:48] <UncleFester6> irc conversation here describes grondilu and araujo with same problem: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-06-10#i_5707703

[13:49] * grondilu is glad to see he is not alone with this difficulty

[13:51] <UncleFester6> grondilu: I am not great with git but I did a "git reset --hard 5a415c993343cea899c10e52abd0cc0d76a90b37" which took me back just before the nqp change and I could build rakudo.

[13:52] <grondilu> UncleFester6: thanks, I'll try that but I think I'll just use rakudo-star until the problem is resolved.

[13:53] <PerlJam> grondilu: except that there isn't a problem for most of us.

[13:53] <PerlJam> (no one is working on the problem they can't see)

[15:07] <mike89_> this stuff I allready now;) 

[15:07] <harmil> heh

[15:07] <harmil> I'm looking at MiniDBI now… what was your question?

[15:07] <mike89_> ok, let me start again...:) 

[15:08] <mike89_> my task is to write a http app using Perl Rakudo

[15:08] <mike89_> but I have problems installing modules 

[15:08] <mike89_> its not as easy as with cpan and perl5

[15:08] <harmil> Are you checking out Rakudo directly or using Rakudo Star?

[15:08] <mike89_> star

[15:08] <harmil> Ok, good

[15:09] <harmil> platform?

[15:09] <mike89_> fedora

[15:09] <harmil> OK, so what do you do and what happens?

[15:09] <mike89_> fedora 16 to be precise

[15:09] <harmil> I'll assume that's relatively current. I'm not a Fedora guy, though I use it sometimes at work

[15:10] *** Facefox joined
[15:11] <mike89_> Yes fedora 16 is fairly new and stable... 

[15:11] <mike89_> tell me how do you install modules for perl6

[15:11] <harmil> ok

[15:12] <moritz> mike89_: with   panda install modulename

[15:12] <harmil> ^

[15:12] <mike89_> panda??

[15:12] <harmil> panda comes with R*

[15:12] <mike89_> its like cpan??

[15:12] <moritz> not quite as good yet

[15:12] <harmil> it's the cpanalike in a way, though newer

[15:12] <harmil> what mortiz++ said

[15:13] <moritz> but it does resolve dependencies for you

[15:13] <mike89_> oh great

[15:13] <mike89_> so i will use it

[15:13] <mike89_> another question

[15:13] <harmil> I'm just getting the hang of the facilities myself, so I was making sure I knew how to correctly invoke panda before answering

[15:14] <harmil> sure

[15:14] <mike89_> this app of mine...

[15:15] <mike89_> i would like to use some catalogs and few files so it would look good and here comes the question

[15:15] <mike89_> how to use method described in other file??

[15:15] <harmil> "use modulename"

[15:16] <harmil> This assumes that your other file is named "modulename.pm6"

[15:16] <crab2313> mike89_: and -I XXX

[15:16] <mike89_> and if it is deep in the catalog

[15:16] <mike89_> ??

[15:16] <mike89_> catalog tree

[15:17] <harmil> I'm not 100% sure what "catalog" in this context, means. Do you mean directory tree?

[15:17] <mike89_> yes

[15:18] <harmil> So, :: is used to separate module hierarchies which are represented on the FS as directories. … however

[15:19] *** grondilu left
[15:20] <harmil> I wonder what your goal is, here. If it's to be an early adopter in P6-land, then you're on the right track. If it's to just get something done, then P6 may not be quite at the point that you think it is. I don't want to dissuade you, because new users are a good thing, but I want you to understand what using a language that isn't yet fully released entails...

[15:20] <mike89_> let me supprise you

[15:21] <harmil> surprise away ;)

[15:21] <mike89_> i am writhing a thesis about Parrot and Perl6

[15:21] <harmil> Ah, OK. Good stuff

[15:21] <mike89_> indeed

[15:22] <harmil> Like I said, I just wanted to make sure you knew which bar you walked into :-)

[15:22] <harmil> We're a "welcome anyone who wants to be here" sort of crowd, as I understand it

[15:22] *** skids joined
[15:22] <mike89_> oh now I know... and i must stay in here for a while 

[15:24] <harmil> well, then welcome

[15:24] <mike89_> and it looks like fun aspecially after I read this:

[15:24] <mike89_> http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/perl-6-is-my-mmorpg

[15:24] <harmil> yeah, so "use X::Y" becomes "open X/Y.pm6 and import its goodness"

[15:24] <mike89_> "goodness" you say:) 

[15:25] <mike89_> ok, and there does not need to be whole tree... main directory of the program is root in this case??

[15:25] <harmil> Where 'goodness' is defined (by me) as "the things that it exports"

[15:26] <harmil> The root(s) of the tree are contained in the PERL6LIB environment variable, which looks a lot like the UNIX PATH (or PERL5LIB) plus some defaults. I believe "." is one of those defaults.

[15:28] *** adu joined
[15:28] <harmil> heya adu

[15:28] <mike89_> so to do it nicely I have to add path to my program in PERL6LIB environment variable

[15:28] <mike89_> ??

[15:28] <harmil> The path to the root of any modules that your program wants to include, yes.

[15:29] <mike89_> superb

[15:29] <harmil> Much like you would in Perl 5

[15:29] *** mucker joined
[15:30] <mike89_> well the fun part is that i don't know Perl5 or Perl6 

[15:30] <harmil> ah, OK

[15:30] <mike89_> so it's a great adventure for me

[15:30] <harmil> yeah, there will be some learning curve, here, but it's worth it, I think

[15:31] <mike89_> my opinion as well

[15:31] <mike89_> any hints with writing http apps??

[15:36] <moritz> eeks

[15:36] <moritz> that's the precompilation-in-wrong-order bug

[15:36] <harmil> crab2313: sorry, my bad

[15:36] <harmil> OK, so I have a DateTime::Utils question. When I try to panda install it, I get "Variable $.hour used where no 'self' is available"

[15:37] <harmil> is this known working and I'm doing something wrong?

[15:37] <harmil> or is there a newer alternative?

[15:37] <harmil> I really need strftime

[15:37] <moritz> and there's Bailador (a clone of Perl 5 Dancer) for the server side

[15:37] <moritz> harmil: I think that's easily fixable

[15:38] <harmil> OK, so it's not a problem in my setup

[15:40] <mike89_> ok, one more question and I have to go. Where I can find specs about how parrot is actually workig?? and please don' tell me parrot.org... :) 

[15:40] <harmil> moritz: you want I should fork and pull request a fix?

[15:40] <harmil> Hmm… parrot.org? ;-)

[15:40] <harmil> make89_: let me look

[15:41] <mike89_> I need it for theoretical part of the job to be done

[15:42] <harmil> It's not a terrible idea to start with what's in https://github.com/parrot/parrot/tree/master/docs

[15:42] <harmil> It's obviously not end-user documentation, but there's a good bit of detail in there.

[15:43] <harmil> at the very least it's a good place to start asking questions. I'm not sure, but I think there's a parrot channel somewhere that's useful to ask such questions also.

[15:44] <mike89_> ok, honesty I havent tking of searching for parrot docs at github <stupid> <stupid> <stupid> ...;)

[15:45] <mike89_> *honestly 

[15:47] <harmil> moritz: oh, for some reason I thought Date::Time::Utils was yours

[16:48] <moritz> I hope harmil did too :-)

[16:48] <harmil> yes, that was what I was asking

[16:49] <harmil> The one I wrote is kind of based on the Java/Python model, but without being as heavy-weight. It's just a tiny little thing for now, though I imagine it will grow some

[16:56] <harmil> hmm… ok

[16:56] <harmil> What is the difference between my %.x and our %.x in a class definition. The syn doesn't seem too clear on that

[16:57] <moritz> I don't know. Neither make much sense to me, but (maybe apart from sorear) the others disagree violently with me

[16:58] <harmil> Well, what I need is a map of labeled constants associated with a class. If our %.mapping as above isn't the right way to do that, I'm open to suggestions.

[16:58] <flussence> shouldn't that be "has %.x"?

[17:00] <sorear> as well as Class.x

[17:00] <harmil> sorear: yes, that's what I need

[17:35] <p6eval> rakudo a2bacb: OUTPUT«1␤2␤4␤5␤»

[17:35] <felher> doesn't?

[17:36] <felher> I guess it's about flattening, which still confuses me quite often... :)

[17:37] *** not_gerd joined
[17:37] <not_gerd> hello, #perl6

[17:38] <harmil> adu: in what context? the initializer? No, I have a class which has an enum that describes one of the parameters to its constructor.

[17:39] <not_gerd> r: for ((1,2),(4,5)).lol -> $a { say "$a"; }

[17:39] <p6eval> rakudo a2bacb: OUTPUT«1 2␤4 5␤»

[17:40] <not_gerd> felher: ^^

[17:40] *** Chillance joined
[17:40] <moritz> felher: in both cases the list flattens out

[17:40] <harmil> adu: I don't see how that helps. I still have the same question

[17:40] <moritz> felher: but a -> $a, $b  signature simply takes two values at a time

[17:40] <harmil> that's more of just a style choice

[17:41] <moritz> r: say (1, 2, 4, 5).reduce: -> $a, $b { say "$a"; say ">$b"; }

[17:41] <p6eval> rakudo a2bacb: OUTPUT«1␤>2␤True␤>4␤True␤>5␤True␤»

[18:07] <colomon> what is the problem?

[18:10] <felher> The problem ist, that reduce on ((1,2),(3,4)) gehts (1,2) and (3,4) in it's variables, while the for loop gets 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. I have expecetd reduce to get 1 in $a and 2 in $b int its frist, run, not (1,2) and (3,4). Just as the for loops gets 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and not (1,2) and (3,4)

[18:26] <harmil> I suppose you could have taken a break in a three year old bathroom to do it....

[18:27] <harmil> So, tonight I'll want to follow up. Any advice on next steps for a module? Do I go through some sort of "get on the the panda radar" request process?

[19:40] <sirrobert> Any ideas where I can look for resolution?

[19:43] *** jaldhar left

[19:43] <sirrobert> but not from outside

[19:44] <sirrobert> (also, it was working a few days ago... maybe a system update broke it?)

[19:44] <moritz> what does   which perl6   say?

[19:45] <sirrobert> hmm I had copied it to /usr/local/bin myself

[19:45] <sirrobert> looking at the make install output now to see where it said it put it...

[19:46] <moritz> into install/ in the rakudo dir

[19:46] <moritz> (no need for sudo)

[19:46] <moritz> so I guess you have a version mismatch between the copied and the install perl6 binary

[19:46] <sirrobert> ah, I see it.  So I should just add .../rakudo/install/bin to $PATH

[19:47] <sirrobert> or is something else better?

[19:49] <sirrobert> Ok, I see how it's supposed to work.  Got it resolved (thanks)

[20:07] <perlenthusiast> why don't they distribute a new perl which contains both perl6 and perl 5 binaries or code perl6 in such away that it would switch version according to the script

[20:08] <perlenthusiast> that's easy.......otherwise stop calling it perl6 because this is cult behavior.....by believing on power and adoption of perl5 so much they refuse to let perl die so they call it perl6 to hook people in but say it's a development name

[20:08] <perlenthusiast> that's dishonesty and dilute the spirit of hard working programmers out there

[20:08] <moritz> who is "they"?

[20:08] <flussence> I think implying you have some sort of "ownership" over the perl5 name is also cult behaviour.

[20:09] <moritz> and I'd like to see back ups for the claim that it's "easier" to unify both perl 5 and perl 6 into the same binary

[20:09] <moritz> (especially since there isn't one Perl 6 binary, but one for every compiler)

[20:10] <harmil> really? We're feeding trolls, now?

[20:10] <perlenthusiast> let me be clear....the wide adoption and philosophy of perl (many ways of doing things) are making it impossible to move forward perl6 or any perl past 5....we have a situation where developers have reached the limit of their brain power and can't move forward

[20:11] <perlenthusiast> but they can't admit that new perl can't be backward compatible so they think and think and think

[22:33] <pmichaud> ...because method reduce appears to be defined with .list and not .flat

[22:33] <pmichaud>     method reduce(&with) { self.list.reduce(&with) }

[22:34] <pmichaud> thus the parcels don't flatten.  I don't know if reduce _should_ be defined with .flat.

[22:36] <pmichaud> there's some inconsistency in .list versus .flat in many of the builtins (and I'm not sure what the distinction ought to be)

[22:37] *** _fall0ut_ joined
[22:38] <pmichaud> it's also the case that some methods on Parcel should force .flat even if the ones in Any do not.

[22:40] <TimToady> I would generally expect reduce to flatten

[22:44] <felher> pmichaud: ah, okay. I did expect it to have the same behavior as .map does, which does flatten, iirc. :)

[22:44] <felher> pmichaud: very interesting talk today, btw ;)

[22:44] <felher> * :)

[22:45] <pmichaud> felher: thanks!

[22:47] <harmil> flussence: sorry, I was afk for $work

[22:47] <pmichaud> the talks I did at this conference were some of the most fun ones to do

[22:47] <harmil> yes, I have a repo at https://github.com/ajs/perl6-log

[22:48] <harmil> pmichaud: you were doing the iterators talk, right?

[22:48] <pmichaud> yesterday  lists and parcels.... today iterators

[22:48] <felher> pmichaud: glad to hear that. :) I will watch your other talk as soon as the recordings are online :)

[22:48] *** adu joined
[22:48] <pmichaud> yes, I'm eager to see videos too

[22:48] <harmil> The "I'll wrap up in 2 minutes, once I finish infinity" was one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a technical talk

[22:49] <harmil> Especially, given that the talk involved lots of details on iterators giving you slightly more than you asked for.

[22:49] *** binary_ joined
[22:50] <adu> harmil: lolol

[22:50] <pmichaud> harmil: yes, it was a nice surprise.  improv is fun :)

[22:50] <harmil> indeed

[22:50] <flussence> there you go

[22:50] <harmil> woot! thank you

[22:51] <adu> ecosystem?

[22:51] <flussence> modules.* will take a while to show it, I think it's updated once an hour

[22:51] <harmil> that's panda's view of where to get modules

[22:52] <adu> flussence: when https://github.com/andydude/p6-xml grows up to be a polished module, can it join that list too?

[22:53] <harmil> hmm… nothing from supernovus yet on Date::Time::Utils

[22:53] <harmil> er DateTime::Utils that is

[22:53] <flussence> adu: yes, just remind someone again when it's ready :)
