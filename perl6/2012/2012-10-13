[09:52] <Timbus> you could try using nativecall to set the terminal thru termios but i don't like your chances

[13:48] <jnthn> hm, you're right :/

[13:48] <Ulti> even if I read(1) I have to press return to get the buffer back its very odd... I can't see from the Rakudo source why it would be true other than parrot doing this

[19:59] <moritz> it feels good to have hacked a bit on rakudo again :-)

[20:03] <moritz> and while the wildcard cases aren't implemented, I think it's good enough to flip the bit in the feature matrix

[21:18] <_edwin> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Paraffins#Perl_6

[21:18] <_edwin> my first RC entry that works with both niecza and rakudo, I think

[21:23] <sorear> yay

[21:25] * sorear notes that the task makes no mention of things like tetra-t-butyl-methane

[21:25] <_edwin> quite a lot faster on niecza, however I was not patient enough to reach n=200 :/

[21:28] <_edwin> sorear, interesting. while doing the task, in fact I wondered if all of these theoretical isomers would really fit within 3-dim. space :}

[21:28] <_edwin> didn't know there were even named ones that don't

[21:30] <_edwin> and such small ones, too

[21:31] <sorear> There are rules by which names can be given for any tree structure

[21:32] <sorear> If you were feeling really ambitious you could even code the rules into your solution :)

[21:33] <sorear> although "tetra-t-butyl-methane" is not really a kosher name, it should be "3,3-di-t-butyl 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl pentane"

[21:34] <_edwin> that would be a nice addition to the RC "extra credit"

[21:35] <sorear> finding noncanonical but shorter names is probably P^NP-hard

[21:42] <skids> moritz++ I'm sure I have some commented out code somewhere wanting to use that feature.

[21:53] <not_gerd> hello, #perl6
