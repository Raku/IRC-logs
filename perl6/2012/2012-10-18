[02:24] <raiph> On this channel back in 2010, tedv asked "What major features are missing from rakudo that prevents it from passing the whole test suite?". Of course, the test suite has grown since then, but I thought it interesting to consider how things have improved (or not) in the over 2 years since.

[02:25] <raiph> The answer, mostly from Moritz, ended up as "hundreds of corner cases, proper lazy lists, macros, some built-ins, regex features, parsing limitations (for example adverbs on quotes and modifiers), proper longest-token matching, proper named enums, binary data support, array and hash autovivification, bigints, native types, S09 (compact structures), Perl 5, proper stack traces, phasers, MAIN" 

[02:27] <raiph> Am I right in saying Rakudo now includes a decent initial cut at all but compact structures and Perl 5?

[02:29] <raiph> (All in that list. And I realize there are probably still hundred of corner cases (perhaps thousands), laziness is a wip, macros are only half done, etc.)

[02:32] <sorear> there are an infinite number of corner cases. :p

[02:36] <colomon> does that mean it's a circle?

[02:43] <raiph> heh. i think it was recent diakopter fuzzbot results that made me put the thousands comment in. 

[02:45] <raiph> colomon: maybe a whirlpool?

[14:39] <sirrobert> is there a sort-in-place type of operation that's built in?

[14:39] <sirrobert> r: my @a = (3, 2, 1, 4); @a.sort; say @a.perl;

[14:39] <p6eval> rakudo 27a6b8: OUTPUT¬´Array.new(3, 2, 1, 4)‚ê§¬ª

[14:39] <sirrobert> except that sorts in place

[14:40] <moritz> @a.=sort

[14:40] <sirrobert> dang it, moritz

[14:40] <sirrobert> every time I get a hold on the coolness of p6's architecture, you mess me up ;)

[14:41] <sirrobert> neat new features that are features I already know about!

[14:41] <sirrobert> just not in that way.

[14:41] *** hash_table joined
[14:41] *** sqirrel joined
[14:44] <sirrobert> question about that:

[14:45] <sirrobert> r: my %f = (a=>[1,2,3,4]); say %f<a>.WHAT; %f<a>.=sort; say %f<a>.WHAT;

[14:45] <p6eval> rakudo 27a6b8: OUTPUT¬´Array()‚ê§Parcel()‚ê§¬ª

[14:46] <sirrobert> Would it be a reasonable feature request to have the value there remain an array after .=sort?

[14:49] <rjbs> Why did it change?

[14:49] <sirrobert> I guess I can do 

[14:49] <sirrobert> r: my $a = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]; say $a.WHAT; $a.=sort.=Array; say $a.WHAT;

[14:49] <p6eval> rakudo 27a6b8: OUTPUT¬´Array()‚ê§Array()‚ê§¬ª

[14:49] <moritz> rjbs: because .sort returns a Parcel

[14:49] <rjbs> Heh, fair enough.

[14:49] <sirrobert> I guess I'd like to see sort return the same type as it started with, then

[14:52] <sirrobert> (the reason I hit it is I'm doing an eqv on two hashes and I sort the arrays after building

[14:52] *** FROGGS joined
[14:53] <sirrobert> the %a eqv %b failed (reasonably) if an element in %a is an array and the corresponding one in %b is a list

[14:57] <moritz> we've also discussed something like eqv that is a bit more forgiving on the exact types

[14:57] <moritz> but so far, no action was taken

[14:59] <sirrobert> so, what language is that written in?

[14:59] <sirrobert> the implementation of sort, I mean

[14:59] <sirrobert> err eqv I mean

[15:00] <sirrobert> I could take a stab at something, perhaps =)

[15:00] <moritz> Perl 6

[15:01] <sirrobert> grrrreat.  If I were to try to contribute something small like that, what's the right process/procedure?

[15:02] <moritz> multi sub infix:<eqv>(...) { ...}

[15:02] <sirrobert> I suppose someone should first approve the idea =)

[15:02] <moritz> sirrobert: well, I'd recommend to first write it as a module

[15:02] <sirrobert> moritz: ahh, I see

[15:02] <moritz> sirrobert: and if people generally like it, we can include it in rakudo

[15:02] <sirrobert> moritz: that's a good path

[15:02] <sirrobert> thanks, will do =)

[15:02] <moritz> luckily it's not harder to write operators in a module than in rakudo :-)

[15:07] <ggoebel> what is the name of the most mature perl6 web framework and where can I find it so as to take it out for a spin?

[15:09] <moritz> probably dancer

[15:09] <moritz> you can find it on modules.perl6.org

[15:09] <moritz> erm, bailador is the name :-)

[16:13] <masak> is there any good, elucidating reason infix:<**> is the *simplest* operation (among infix:<+>, infix:<*>, and infix:<**>) on Church numerals?

[16:13] <masak> I mean, is there some deep connection between infix:<**> and function application somehow?

[16:14] <masak> notation such as log**2($x) would indicate there is, but maybe that is a red herring.

[16:18] <TimToady> I'd rather keep eqv strict and make @array.=sort preserve the type on the left somehow

[23:07] <am0c> In the Synopsis, I couldn't find an example which use 'does' as a trait in a declartion statement; but STD.pm doesn't complain whether or not i use it in this way. and rakudo just doesn't seem to constraint.

[23:08] <sorear> am0c: syntactically, traits are quite orthogonal

[23:08] <sorear> it's supposed to be a "run-time" ish failure

[23:09] <sorear> dunno what rakudo is doing

[23:17] <Juerd> mosh is great. I've installed mosh on feather.

[23:18] <Juerd> If you use screen and irc on feather, you'll probably want mosh. Just so you know :)
