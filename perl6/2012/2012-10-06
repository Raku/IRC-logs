[12:02] <edwin_> hi perl6!

[12:03] <edwin_> I wonder if there is a natural inverse to :60[$a, $b, $c]

[12:03] <rindolf> edwin_: hello.

[12:03] <rindolf> edwin_: what's up?

[12:03] <edwin_> i.e. given $x produce the list $x % 60, ($x div 60) % 60, ...

[12:05] <edwin_> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_step_of_GOST_28147-89#Perl_6

[12:05] <timbunce> moritz: yeap, got that one. thanks. And I've just found http://pmichaud.com/2012/pres/

[12:06] <moritz> edwin_: I wonder if Int.base should accept a :list adverb

[12:06] *** prammer joined
[12:09] <edwin_> moritz, sounds good. would that give a lazy list ending in ,0 xx * ?

[12:09] <edwin_> or one could specify how many "digits" are wanted

[12:12] *** wamba joined
[12:13] <moritz> edwin_: on an integer, it's always a finiite list

[12:13] *** nodmonkey joined
[12:14] *** nodmonkey left
[12:15] <edwin_> ok, so one would have to extend with zeroes explicitly to fill a fixed size array of digits, for example

[12:15] <moritz> yes

[12:16] <edwin_> it seems like an easy problem made hard by a plethora of bike sheds :)

[12:16] <Timbus> n: \a = "wait what?"; say a;

[12:16] <edwin_> I know that I would like to have this functionality, but I cannot decide exactly how I'd want it

[12:17] <p6eval> rakudo fa7fca: OUTPUT«lol␤»

[12:18] <moritz> only works in declarations

[12:18] <Timbus> what the heck aaaaa

[12:20] <Timbus> the lack of sigil confuses and infuriates me. how long has this been a feature

[12:21] *** birdwindupbird joined
[12:21] <moritz> then don't use the feature

[12:21] <moritz> it's been specced for several month

[12:21] <moritz> and implemented for maybe two months

[12:22] <moritz> it's very useful if you don't want to impose a context

[12:22] <moritz> beause sigils are tied to context

[12:23] <Timbus> oh okay its fairly newish then

[12:26] <edwin_> it's nice if you just want to name an expression, not put it in a container, I find

[12:27] <Timbus> that is kinda neat, yes

[12:27] <edwin_> I think it will take me some time to find a balance, when to use it and when not

[13:39] <timbunce> *something we could call perl6

[13:40] <moritz> well, apart from the mug throwing, there aren't many really notable dates

[13:40] <moritz> maybe the first R* release

[13:40] <moritz> or the first pugs release

[13:40] <moritz> or... I don't know

[13:40] <moritz> it's really up to interpretation

[13:40] <timbunce> The first pugs release seems like a clear milestone. Got a date?

[13:41] <timbunce> though perhaps R* was more clearly 'perl6'

[13:41] <timbunce> Was July 2010 the first R* release? https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/docs/announce/2010.07

[21:01] <Coleoid> Hi, #perl6 people!

[21:02] <timbunce> Is the perl6 code on page 71 of http://www.slideshare.net/Tim.Bunce/perl-myths-200909 still valid?

[21:02] <timbunce> and page 72, while I'm asking.

[21:03] <diakopter> type it into a gist, then give the gist url to p6eval here

[21:03] <timbunce> oops, scratch that. page 72 isn't code in that old version

[21:03] <flussence> I don't see anything in there that's changed significantly since 2009

[21:12] <flussence> my brain can't parse that "1,1 *+*"

[21:12] <diakopter> what if you want to use a prior term more than once

[21:13] <grondilu> diakopter: you need to be more explicit in writing the closure

[21:13] <grondilu> like { $^x + $x**2 + $^y }

[21:13] <grondilu> imho

[21:17] <grondilu> Does sockets work for you?

[21:17] <grondilu> *Do

[21:18] <Coleoid> Can I eval code in a base class method and have it alter a variable in a derived class?

[21:20] <diakopter> what kind of variable?

[21:21] <Coleoid> A scalar to start with,

[21:22] <Coleoid> But the reason I'm evalling and subclassing is that I want the effects to be different per class.

[21:22] <diakopter> you can have it run a method which alters a variable

[21:24] <Coleoid> I want the user to type Perl 6 code, and have the class check that it had the effect they wanted.

[21:26] <Coleoid> So I want them able to set a scalar, or several, or set a list, or ...

[21:26] <Coleoid> I hoped to abstract the eval & check success loop into a base class, and it _looks_ good, but it's not working.

[21:29] *** cognominal joined
[21:30] *** tokuhiro_ joined
[21:32] <Coleoid> A non-OO answer would be fine with me, but my first attempt at that (passing the success check code block as an argument to the eval loop) had the same problem, and others besides.

[21:33] <diakopter> I'm having trouble picturing the code's structure

[21:33] <moritz> Coleoid: sounds like role composition would fit better, because it adds the method right into the derived class

[21:34] <moritz> Coleoid: but it would be even better if you stated your actual use case; maybe there's a neat solution for it

[21:34] <moritz> but I fear I have to go to sleep now; will backlog

[21:34] <Coleoid> https://gist.github.com/3846209

[21:35] <Coleoid> diakopter: sorry, meant to post the gist sooner.

[21:36] <Coleoid> moritz:  I'll try a role!  As for the use case,

[21:38] <Coleoid> It's a kid's P6 fantasy adventure, where the spell-caster needs to do magic via Perl 6 code.

[21:40] <flussence> I think you should do the eval in the other class.

[21:40] <flussence> you don't really need a class either, just a sub that takes the string to eval and returns true/false

[21:41] <Coleoid> Which works okay for the first quest,

[21:42] *** SamuraiJack left
[21:43] *** kurahaupo joined
[21:44] <Coleoid> But I don't see how I can get it to check different code for each class.  I suppose I could pass in the success check to be eval'ed also?

[21:45] <diakopter> put the different success checks in subs and pass in references to the subs

[21:46] <Coleoid> ...
