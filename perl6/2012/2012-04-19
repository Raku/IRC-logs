[01:53] <colomon> I'm getting Two definitions found for symbol ::GLOBAL::ABC::Duration::&duration-from-parse

[01:53] <dalek> tablets: keep on dashing and quirks removing

[01:53] <dalek> tablets: review: https://github.com/perl6/tablets/commit/e35201a8ec

[01:53] <colomon> Here's the code in question: https://gist.github.com/2417825

[01:54] <colomon> sorear: is there something stupid I'm doing wrong there, or is Niecza being unreasonable about exported multis?

[01:54] <sorear> Niecza is being unreasonable about our-scoped multis

[01:54] <sorear> I think exported multis per se is fine

[01:56] <colomon> hmmm... have to admit I have no idea why there's an our there at all.  seems to work fine in rakudo without them...

[01:57] *** libertyprime left

[01:59] <colomon> removing the ours seems to help for niecza as well.

[02:00] *** liuchong joined
[02:01] <sorear> So

[02:01] <colomon> Hmmm, yeah, goes back to 2009.  So it must have been alpha.

[02:01] <sorear> Who will be the first person in over a month to show up first on planet6?

[02:02] <colomon> Most recent post there is last week.

[02:03] <colomon> Masak's post from last month is incorrectly listed as most recent.

[02:03] <sorear> That's what I mean

[02:03] <sorear> it's finally possible to beat masak to the top

[02:03] <colomon> oh!

[09:53] <cognominal_> arnholt: one of the France paradox is that it wants oil but pretends to ignore it gets part of it cheaply thru corruption in Africa. Nevertheless, we give lessons to US in UN when they invade Irak.

[11:37] <dalek> niecza: review: https://github.com/sorear/niecza/commit/aa61ed50e6

[11:39] <fglock> the goal was to have a perl 5 in the browser, that is done - node.js, CPAN, and everything else are way ahead of the initial goals; and XS is almost completely ruled out

[11:40] <pmurias> XS doesn't seem doable without embedding the perl5 interpreter

[11:41] <pmurias> which doesn't make much sense

[11:42] <fglock> XS may be doable in luajit; it embeds a C compiler; it would probably needs big tweaks

[11:42] <fglock> *need

[11:43] <fglock> it may even be doable in node.js with C++; it just looks complicated

[11:43] <pmurias> it would require duplicating the perl5 internals

[11:44] <pmurias> or just duplicating the api to the perl5 internals

[11:45] <fglock> yes, the api only

[11:46] <fglock> alternately, emscripten: http://mozakai.blogspot.com/

[11:48] <fglock> and alternately, LLVM directly if you have lots of tuits

[11:50] <fglock> or reuse niecza VM - that would be cool, btw

[12:24] <flussence> I wonder what their point of reference was, COBOL? BASIC?

[12:25] <arnsholt> Java, C# perhaps

[12:26] <cognominal_> may be this guy comes from the near future and talks of the next craze : Perl 6

[12:26] <colomon> perl certainly predates C#.

[12:26] <cognominal_> and Java by a large margin.

[12:27] <arnsholt> colomon: I know that. Not sure if the journalist does though =)

[12:27] <colomon> fair enough!

[12:27] <flussence> Perl might predate that person :)

[14:07] *** lloyd_ left
[14:07] <fglock> a perl5 "model" is like: what would be the perl6 version of @ISA / bless / package; how to deal with variable redeclaration in the same scope (not allowed in perl6) - things like that

[14:08] <jaffa4> yes

[14:08] <fglock> what we have now is the sigil substitution, and a few operators - that was the easy part

[14:09] *** kaleem left
[14:09] <fglock> and the perl5 parser :)

[14:09] <jaffa4> the perl 5 compiler.. What does it translate perl 5 into?

[14:09] <pmurias> javascript

[14:10] <jaffa4> Why?

[14:10] <fglock> it translates into abstract syntax tree (just a perl structure)

[14:10] <fglock> the AST is then transformed in what you might want (javascript for example)

[14:10] <jaffa4> I guess you want to run perl 5 on something.

[14:11] <fglock> we have emitters for perl5 (roundtrip testing), javascript, and a very limited perl6

[14:12] *** fhelmberger joined
[14:12] <jaffa4> WHat is your plan of finishing it?

[14:12] <fglock> jaffa4: javascript because it is fun to play in the browser; and because node.js is pretty fast

[14:13] <jaffa4> node.js?

[14:13] <jaffa4> ok, I found it

[14:13] <fglock> http://nodejs.org - a javascript + libraries

[14:14] <jaffa4> Is it faster than perl5?

[14:14] <fglock> no, it is approximately the same speed in the current version

[14:15] <fglock> on average - specific commands can be slower/faster

[14:15] *** wtw left
[14:16] <jaffa4> okay

[14:16] *** kresike left
[14:18] <jaffa4> fglock: what do you think when you will have a decent perl 5 to perl 6 compiler ready?

[14:20] <fglock> we have discussed it here a while ago, there is a reason to expect that compiling perl5 directly to the perl6 VM gives better results

[14:20] <fglock> than compiling perl5 to perl6 and then to the VM

[14:20] <jaffa4> Parrot?

[14:21] <fglock> yes, perl5 to Parrot or .NET

[14:21] <pmurias> or niecza's nam

[14:21] <fglock> exactly

[14:21] <fglock> that is the whole idea of Parrot, actually

[14:22] <fglock> javascript just happens to be a nice VM nowadays

[14:22] <jaffa4> BUt compiling to perl 6 would allow reusing perl 5 code

[14:22] <jaffa4> in Perl 6 packages

[14:23] <PerlJam> jaffa4: you want to write a perl5 to perl6 translator? :)

[14:24] <fglock> true - but sharing a common VM also does allow reusing

[14:24] <fglock> PerlJam: we have a prototype working

[14:24] <pmurias> there is a difference between translating perl6 to perl5 and compiling perl6 to perl5

[14:24] <jaffa4> I refered to the other direction

[14:24] <PerlJam> fglock: rakudo and niecza don't share a common VM, but they both grok perl6.  Seems like compiling to Perl 6 is a bigger win

[14:25] <jaffa4> or to C or C++

[14:25] <jaffa4> pmuries:What would be the difference?

[14:26] <fglock> I think there is only one way to know what is better; write both p5-to-p6 and p5-to-VM and see what works better

[14:26] *** fhelmberger left
[14:26] <PerlJam> indeed

[14:26] <PerlJam> But  there's something to be said for "easier to implement" too :)

[14:26] <jaffa4> fglock: it works better if you can produce a better pasm than rakudo.

[14:26] <jaffa4> Can you?

[14:27] <pmurias> jaffa4: either trying to preserve correctness as much as possibe or aiming to produce human readable/modifiable code

[14:27] <colomon> r: say "test  ".subst(/(\s+)$/, { "XYZZY$0" })

[14:28] <jaffa4> pmuries: if I wonder if these are contradictory aims.

[14:29] <pmurias> jaffa4: a lot of things behave slightly differently in perl6

[14:29] <PerlJam> jaffa4: not contradictory, no.

[14:37] <fglock> the problem with multiple backends - this is *very* distracting; you need to multiply the tuits accordingly

[14:38] <pmichaud> good afternoon, #perl6

[14:38] <PerlJam> fglock: get some of the #parrot people to maintain the parrot backend :)

[14:38] <moritz> good am, pmichaud 

[14:39] <PerlJam> pmichaud: greetings

[14:39] <fglock> pmichaud: o/

[14:39] <moritz> erm, afternoon? are you in .no already?

[14:39] <pmichaud> yes

[14:39] <moritz> \o/

[14:39] <moritz> then we'll meet in about 25 hours

[14:39] <pmichaud> planning to head off to Oslo.pm in a few

[14:39] * tadzik is jealous

[14:40] <pmichaud> I always try to arrive a day early so I can rest a bit before the activities begin

[14:40] <pmichaud> and, in this case, I get to attend a talk by TheDamian++

[14:40] <moritz> nice :-)

[14:41] <colomon> DamianTalks++

[14:41] <jaffa4> fglock: then concentrate on one only

[14:41] <moritz> well, we eurpeans don't have so much jet lag this time :-)

[14:41] <fglock> PerlJam: "not invented here" - I think p5-in-p5 will be reimplemented at some point; and by several people :)

[14:42] <fglock> jaffa4: yes, javascript for now (and p5-to-p5)

[14:42] <moritz> I already have 5-in-5 compiler :-)

[14:42] <jaffa4> I cannot see point in p5 in p5.

[14:43] <PerlJam> pmichaud: What's Damian talking about?  I think I've only heard about him doing "Conference Presentation Judo" lately.

[14:43] <fglock> 5-in-5 can replace source filters

[14:43] <fglock> it can do "strange stuff"

[14:43] <pmichaud> PerlJam: Basic arithmetic stuff, I think.  Just a sec.

[14:44] <jaffa4> code transformation, refactoring

[14:44] <pmichaud> PerlJam:  "Talk by Damian Conway: Temporally Quaquaversal Virtual Nanomachine Programming In Multiple Topologically Connected Quantum-Relativistic Parallel Spacetimes‚Ä¶ Made Easy! "

[14:44] <pmichaud> so yeah, arithmetic stuff.

[14:45] <pmichaud> (iirc, this is his "virtual time" talk)

[14:45] <moritz> I wonder if he has written a talk title obfuscator

[14:46] <pmichaud> moritz: probably -- and it's in a module that he's just about to upload to CPAN.  :-)

[14:58] <fglock> jaffa4: nevermind, I've misread some joke :P

[14:59] <TimToady> jlaire: re http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2012-04-19#i_5464683 we use the term "character" to mean the current Unicode level, so it means "grapheme" already by default (but can mean "codepoints" or "bytes" depending on context)

[15:00] <TimToady> modulo the fact that nobody actually implements grapheme mode yet...

[15:02] * TimToady wonders if we should force all current programs to declare "use codepoints;" just to keep bug compatibility later...

[15:03] <moritz> we aren't that squeamish with other incompatible changes we introduce to language or compilers

[15:04] <TimToady> sure, but if people really start using Perl 6 in production before we declare 6.0.0, they're likely to get burned on this, as well as the other things, admittedly

[15:05] <TimToady> mostly just doing a bit of awareness building here...

[15:05] <moritz> the solution of course is to declare it 6.0.0 before it goes into too many production environments

[15:06] <moritz> and defering some features to later p6 versions

[15:06] <daxim> that worked out so fine for kde 4!!111

[15:07] <moritz> daxim: except that people deinstalled kde 3 to use kde 4

[15:07] <moritz> we don't expect people to deinstall perl 5 as soon as we declare 6.0.0

[15:08] <fglock> maybe declare it 6.0.-1

[15:10] <TimToady> hmm, we could reserve 0 version numbers for prerelease, in which case the first real version is 6.1

[15:11] <moritz> unless we follow the p5 tradition of having odd release numbers as development versions

[15:11] <TimToady> or 6.1.1

[15:11] <moritz> so the first *real* real version would be 6.2 :-)

[15:11] <TimToady> or 6.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1

[15:11] <fglock> that's odd

[15:11] <[Coke]> I am not a huge fan of odd=dev; is there precendent for that other than perl5 ?

[15:11] <jaffa4> Is there a version number now?

[15:12] <TimToady> no

[15:12] <TimToady> use 6ish;

[15:12] <moritz> we used to write   use v6-alpha;

[15:12] <moritz> dunno what happened to that

[15:13] <jaffa4> version control system has version numers

[15:13] <jaffa4> version control system has version numbers

[15:13] *** fhelmberger_ left

[15:15] *** sftp left
[15:15] <fglock> perlito uses "use v6-perlito;" - that's because perl5 can actually handle that

[15:16] <fglock> handling multiple capability specifications can be verbose, as in perl5 "use feature"

[15:17] <TimToady> if Perl versions are really versions of the test suite, then the current incantation would be "use v6.84b3895ce1beab1e016a3853d960fa08eb7f1a66;"

[15:17] <bbkr> i am also not big fan of odd=dev approach. and I consider tripple numbers in version as weird.  if I'm on 1.2.3 should I release 1.3.0 or stay on 1.2.4? this is very relative.

[15:17] <TimToady> er, v6.GIT84b3895ce1beab1e016a3853d960fa08eb7f1a66.

[15:18] <moritz> v6.2012-04-19

[15:19] <TimToady> was just thinking the same

[15:19] <TimToady> but needs an alpha to force before 0

[15:19] <TimToady> v6.asof2012-04-19

[15:19] <moritz> v6:date<2012-04-19>

[15:20] <TimToady> v6._2012-04-19

[15:20] <fglock> use before: 2012-04-19

[15:20] <bbkr> benabik: thanks, interesting lecture. but for Perl 6 model it is quite useless - spec change is never a patch, that makes 3rd param obsolete.

[15:20] <fglock> I've seen this somewhere

[15:21] * moritz wonders if Q:d/2012-04-19/ should create a Date object

[15:22] <moritz> well, probably a task for a module :-)

[15:22] <fglock> "best before see bottom"

[15:22] <benabik> bbkr: Possibly.  I wouldn't rule it out though.  Clarifications that don't actually change the API could be considered under it,  But I wasn't say it was good for the spec, just that version triples are useful.

[15:22] <moritz> and some day I'll collect all such modules, and create the magic.pl6 pragma with which you enable them all

[17:38] <lichtkind> letz take the broken example http://tablets.perl6.org/appendix-a-index.html#v (its alred fixed)

[17:39] <lichtkind> not $?VM (special var)

[17:40] <lichtkind> so so that we can write in instance of ucfirst: ucfirst(s) with a green s of course

[17:40] <uvtc> Sounds like, if you want to make that change, it's going to have to be done manually. {shudder} You can backslash escape the angle brackets, and they'll render correctly in the html.

[17:40] <lichtkind> so can see at first glance what parameter ant return value has any method

[17:40] <lichtkind> &lt; ?

[17:40] *** vlixes joined
[17:41] <lichtkind> or an really sophisticated regex

[17:41] <uvtc> \< in pandoc-markdown will turn into &lt; in html

[17:41] <lichtkind> time to actually use perl 6 :)

[17:41] <lichtkind> yes but &lt; is more eye freindly to me

[17:41] <lichtkind> beside the effort necesary

[17:41] <lichtkind> what you think about the idea?

[17:42] <lichtkind> or we put the in square brackets

[17:43] <lichtkind> it might confusing in combination with subrules

[17:43] <lichtkind> who already use angle brackets

[17:43] <uvtc> lichtkind, I don't know what you mean by "subrules". Also, I'm not sure I see much difference between using ()'s and <>'s.

[17:44] <lichtkind> but you know what i mean with signatures

[17:44] <lichtkind> to list all methods (all ops are methods anyway) with signature

[17:44] <lichtkind> so you get max infor from A

[17:44] <lichtkind> so you get max info from A

[17:44] <uvtc> lichtkind, I'm still very new to Perl 6. When I hear "signature", I think function signature.

[17:44] <lichtkind> of course

[17:44] <lichtkind> methods are functions :)

[17:45] <lichtkind> just with a fance scope :)

[17:45] <lichtkind> now we have substr (category)

[17:46] <lichtkind> whan I want is : substr($s, $n, $n2 ) [category]

[17:46] <lichtkind> or in angle brackets

[17:46] <lichtkind> but some items in the index look like <prior>

[17:46] <lichtkind> these are called predefined subrules

[17:47] <lichtkind> and <prior> <subrule> might look confusing

[17:47] <lichtkind> so i rather choose  <prior> [subrule]

[17:47] <lichtkind> even angle brackets would be really the funny and native expression

[17:48] <lichtkind> or [<category>]

[17:48] <lichtkind> liek a char class :)

[17:48] <lichtkind> thats even more funny

[17:48] <benabik> I go to lunch for an hour and my back scroll has become the lichtkind show.  ;-)

[17:49] <lichtkind> benabik: sorry do that private next time

[17:49] <uvtc> lichtkind, Well, I'm not sure I have any good answer to your question. Since you've got html at your disposal, maybe make use of <span ...> so you can style it how you like later on?

[17:49] <lichtkind> benabik: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

[17:49] *** s1n joined
[17:49] <benabik> lichtkind: Well, it looks like it's on topic, at least.

[17:50] <uvtc> lichtkind, it's easy to overuse (), [], <>, etc., with many of them having to be backslash-escaped.

[17:50] <benabik> lichtkind: Looks like you're trying to embed category information in the tablet source?  My thought is "use whatever syntax is simple".  :-)

[17:50] <uvtc> lichtkind, Another option is to use unicode. Maybe ¬´french quotes¬ª?

[17:51] <lichtkind> benabik: but should have some natural meaning

[17:51] <lichtkind> uvtc: that might good idea

[17:51] <uvtc> lichtkind, those don't have to be backslash-escaped, since they're not markup syntax.

[17:51] <benabik> lichtkind: As long as you use it consistently, it should become natural, I think.

[17:52] <uvtc> viva la unicode

[17:52] <benabik> Doesn't unicode have specialized brackets for categories?  I mean, it has everything else.

[17:57] <lichtkind> yes even a piece of shit

[17:57] <benabik> Now, now.  It's just poo

[17:57] <benabik> But it's a pile of it.

[17:59] <lichtkind> benabik: yes we find something

[17:59] <uvtc> .u 1f4a9

[17:59] <phenny> uvtc: Sorry, no results for '1f4a9'.

[17:59] <colomon> benabik: my three year old loves shift lock

[17:59] *** s1n left
[18:00] <benabik> colomon: "three year olds love it" does not seem like a reasonable reason to keep it.  :-D

[18:00] <colomon> It actually does sort of slightly point to a real reason -- the reason he loves it is that he doesn't have the dexterity to press down shift and a key at the same time.

[18:00] <uvtc> lichtkind, If using Unicode, you could write the markup like "Follow the link to [‚ò∫this-sub‚ò∫](foo.html#bar)."

[18:01] <benabik> colomon: Oh.  Fair enough.  Although sticky keys are useful for just that sort of thing.

[18:02] <colomon> benabik: sure, there are other ways of doing it.

[18:33] <TimToady> well, snowman/comet used to work as matching quotes due to a bug

[18:36] <uvtc> What do you think of the versioning advice at http://semver.org/ ?

[18:36] <TimToady> haven't looked

[18:37] <uvtc> I'm looking to include simple advice to new module authors in the "creating and distributing modules" doc at http://wiki.perl6.org/Create%20and%20Distribute%20Modules .

[18:38] <moritz> version numbers are basically meaningless until we get people to actually do releases of their p6 modules

[18:39] <uvtc> Well, gotta plan for success. :) Is "Use major.minor.patch" good simple advice at this point?

[18:39] <TimToady> 3-part versioning is a pretty old idea, actually; relabelling it "semantic versioning" doesn't seem to accomplish much, offhand

[18:39] <moritz> uvtc: it's not bad

[18:39] <benabik> semver.org basically boils down to "these numbers used to mean something, people!"

[18:40] <moritz> uvtc: I for one like rakudo's YYYY.MM (with optional YYYY.MM.minor) scheme too

[18:40] <tadzik> don't we have this described in S11?

[18:41] <uvtc> I want to give succinct simple advice in the article.

[18:42] <tadzik> sure

[18:42] <uvtc> I see some examples of dotted triads at http://perlcabal.org/syn/S11.html#Versioning ...

[18:42] <tadzik> aye

[18:58] <uvtc> Regarding a module's META.info file, in the perl6/ecosystem spec.pod doc, it says that "name" should be the fully-qualified name module name. What if the project you're distributing (having listed at the Perl 6 module directory) has more than one module in it? What should the "name" then be?

[19:13] <uvtc> Ok. nm. From looking at existing modules, the current practice seems to be: have one main module, and name your project after it. If you need additonal modules, put them in a package alongside and named after your main module (Perl 5 style). For example, the Foo-Bar project would supply the Foo::Bar module plus some others, with the filesystem looking like lib/Foo/Bar.pm6, lib/Foo/Bar/Helper.pm6, lib/Foo/Bar/OtherHelper.pm6.

[20:01] <benabik> Schegen is the EU no passport zone, right?

[20:02] <tadzik> I _really_ hope so

[20:02] <benabik> Looks like they recommend a passport, but you need "an official document that satisfactorily establishes your identity"

[20:02] <benabik> *you just need

[20:03] <tadzik> is that what the website says?

[20:03] <benabik> Yes.

[20:04] <benabik> "Norway takes part in the Schengen co-operation and hence nationals from countries within the Schengen area do not have to show their passport when entering Norway. However you must show an official document that satisfactorily establishes your identity. We therefore recommended that you bring your passport."
