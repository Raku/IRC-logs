[10:23] <jnthn> It's just convention (though a good one) to match file name and path with having a module of that name declared inside the file.

[19:37] <pmurias> [Coke]: re seeing PIR for QAST, I wrote a Perl6 -> QAST dumper which can show you how a bit of Perl 6 code is represented as QAST

[19:40] <pmurias> for getting PIR from QAST I would try using QAST::Compiler to get PIRT

[19:40] <pmurias> and then maybe the .pir method to get pir from that

[19:41] <pmurias> [Coke]: also take a look at nqp/t/qast

[19:42] <moritz> pmurias: where's that dumper?

[19:45] <pmurias> moritz: https://github.com/pmurias/rakudo-js/blob/master/bin/ast-dumper.nqp

[19:45] <pmurias> it's a bit rough

[19:47] <moritz> pmurias: thanks

[20:12] <colomon> rn: say { foo => 1, bar => 2 } cmp  { bar => 2, foo => 5 }

[20:12] <p6eval> niecza v21-23-gd8852de: OUTPUT«Same␤»

[20:12] <p6eval> ..rakudo 7d6aa0: OUTPUT«Decrease␤»

[20:13] <colomon> So... I've reworked niecza's infix:<cmp> to masak++'s suggestion for ordering hashes, and if I'm not mistaken, rakudo is doing it wrong.  (assuming, of course, masak's method is correct.)

[20:15] <colomon> (that is, go through the keys in order and compare their values.)

[20:25] <sorear> colomon: hi.  release is tomorrow

[20:25] <colomon> sorear: okay.  will try to have more useful stuff checked in by then.

[20:39] <sorear> ++colomon

[20:46] <sorear> so I have plans for the next month that involve some moderately serious (ab)use of the CLR assembly naming/resolution system and I'm concerned I might hit a Microsoft/Mono incompatibility

[20:48] * colomon is ablaze with curiosity.... 

[20:51] <[Coke]> pmurias: that test file does have lots of great examples of QAST, but not the nqp they would correspond to, which makes it slightly less useful. I'll see if I can tease out what I need from it,  though.

[21:40] <leont> libuv is a bit disappointing

[21:41] <leont> They don't seem to know the rule #1 of callbacks in C: always include a void pointer for extra state

[21:44] <sorear> how does node work around that?

[21:52] <leont> Ah, I think I found it, there's a public data field in all request objects (that do get passed)

[21:54] <masak> colomon: might well be that rakudo is wrong.

[21:54] <masak> colomon: I'm still mulling over whether't's a good idea to compare hashes that way.

[21:55] <masak> I'd be much more hesitant to do it with sets, for example. but hashes are not that different.

[21:56] <sorear> o/ masak

[21:56] <masak> \o

[21:59] <masak> <GlitchMr> Why commit made 5 days ago would be before commit made a day ago?

[21:59] <masak> because... that's what "before" means...?

[22:00] <masak> but yeah, what [Coke] said. if you want your commits ordered *temporally*, you can do that. but that's not the interesting order.
