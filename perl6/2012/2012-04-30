[09:35] <brrt> why so much syntax?

[09:37] <brrt> especially the colon

[09:39] <jnthn> Everybody wants the colon.

[09:40] <jnthn> Thankfully one of the things it's used for in Perl 5 got changed to something else in Perl 6.

[09:41] <jnthn> Otherwise it woulda had even more meanings :)

[09:41] * jnthn doesn't ever really find the various uses of colons ambiguous though

[09:41] <jnthn> Most of them boil down to adverbs or invocant-related stuff.

[09:41] <arnsholt> TBH, I haven't really noticed much overloading of the colon

[09:42] <jnthn> Well, a bunch of things that look like overloading really boil down to colonpairs.

[09:42] <jnthn> sub foo(Any:D $x) { } 

[09:42] <jnthn> That's just a colonpair, for example.

[09:43] *** mmac_ joined
[09:43] <arnsholt> The colonpair syntax is nice. Kind of like keyword symbols in CL, just better =D

[09:47] *** mmac_ left
[09:53] <tadzik> 45 modules OK, 54 not -- http://tjs.azalayah.net/new.html

[09:55] <wolverian> What are colonpairs?

[09:55] <gfldex> :key('value')

[09:55] *** eviltwin_b left
[09:56] <gfldex> same as Pair.new(key => 'value')

[09:56] *** eviltwin_b joined
[09:56] <masak> good noon, #perl6

[09:56] <wolverian> How is that the same as Any:D?

[09:57] <jnthn> :key('value') is just the most general case of colonpair

[09:57] <jnthn> :key is shorthand for :key(True)

[09:57] <gfldex> :D is the same as :D(True)

[09:57] <jnthn> So :D is really just :D(True)

[09:57] <masak> ooh

[09:57] * masak had not realized

[09:58] <jnthn> longname actually calls the colonpair rule, iirc.

[09:58] <wolverian> Ah, the Any wasn't a part of the colonpair.

[10:02] <jnthn> .DEFINITE

[10:02] <jnthn> Which is a macro

[10:02] <masak> how is it a macro

[10:02] * masak is sending a clarifying email to Emile State

[10:02] <jnthn> It's a macro in the same way .WHAT is.

[10:02] <cognominal> because it is defined in the compiler?

[10:02] <cognominal> versus compiled by it.

[10:03] <tadzik> jnthn, masak: do you have the popolnik desigs docs lying somewhere in your archive by any chance?

[10:03] <gfldex> that macro points into the meta model?

[10:04] *** araujo joined
[10:04] *** araujo left
[10:04] *** araujo joined
[10:04] <jnthn> gfldex: Well, it's a very primitive operation rather than boiling down to a call to a meta-method.

[10:05] <jnthn> gfldex: At a low level, it corresponds to checking if a bit is set in the object flags.

[10:05] <masak> tadzik: not finding any right away, no.

[10:05] <jnthn> That is, it's really cheap.

[10:05] <gfldex> good to hear :)

[10:05] <jnthn> tadzik: There were...popolnik design docs?

[10:05] <tadzik> jnthn: well, an xhtml file mberends++ sent us

[10:06] <jnthn> ah :)

[10:06] <jnthn> .DEFINITE is the same as the macro IS_CONCRETE(obj) in the C code.

[10:07] *** araujo left
[10:08] <masak> tadzik: I'm pretty sure he sent us one, but my search-fu fails me.

[10:08] <masak> jnthn: I still haven't seen exactly how things with the method call syntax can be macros.

[10:08] <tadzik> yeah, same here :/

[10:08] <masak> unless you want to strew textual macros all over the place, which feels... bad.

[10:09] <gfldex> r: multi foo(Any:D $x){ say $x }; multi foo(Any){ die "welp!" }; my $i; foo $i;

[10:09] <p6eval> rakudo 2a962e: OUTPUT«welp!␤  in sub foo at /tmp/HCu9xR8opr:1␤  in block <anon> at /tmp/HCu9xR8opr:1␤␤»

[10:09] <jnthn> masak: I don't expect them to be implemented with the "macro" syntax somewhere.

[10:10] <jnthn> I'm just using the same language the spec does.

[10:11] <masak> ok, so it's just sugar for something else, in essence.

[10:11] <cognominal> masak: because they are specialy handled by the compiler.

[10:11] *** araujo joined
[10:11] <cognominal> so, conceptually, they are macro.

[10:12] <jnthn> masak: Yeah; I'm not implying they're anything you have to worry about. :)

[10:13] <gfldex> how about "optimiser food" ?

[10:13] <jnthn> It's nothing to do with optimization either really.

[10:14] <jnthn> All of the .WHAT/.HOW etc map down to very primitive operations.

[10:15] <masak> maybe "shims" is a good description of what they are.

[10:16] *** mucker left
[10:18] <masak> though shims seem to be mostly used as a compatibility layer when an API changes.

[10:18] <masak> apart from that, they seem to describe what's going on pretty well.

[11:24] <moritz> no

[11:24] <moritz> afaict we have different codegen for small integers

[11:25] <moritz> nqp::p6box_i(123) vs. nqp::fromstr_I("1234555555555555555", Int) or so

[11:27] <colomon> moritz: no bigints in Vector...

[11:28] <moritz> hm, string_to_bigint comes from src/Perl6/Actions.pm

[11:28] <moritz> why would ever take a closure of that?

[11:29] <jnthn> moritz: Yeah, that's what I was being confused about. How on earth.

[11:30] <moritz> and there's nothing inside string_to_bigint that could possibly create a closure either

[11:30] <moritz> there isn't even a block inside

[11:31] * colomon 's code: proudly muddling Rakudo since 2009.

[11:31] <jnthn> Er

[11:31] <jnthn> Is it a method?

[11:31] <jnthn> Or a sub?

[11:32] <moritz> our sub

[11:32] <jnthn> our?

[11:32] <jnthn> Does it need to be "our"?

[11:32] <moritz> I don't think so

[11:32] <jnthn> Me either.

[11:32] <jnthn> Other question: does the module define custom ops?

[11:32] <moritz> I think I just made u

[11:32] <moritz> grrr

[11:32] <moritz> jnthn: yes

[11:33] <jnthn> omg u just made me!

[11:33] <moritz> I think I just made it an our sub because we sometimes did that for code reuse between NQP and rakudo stuff

[11:33] <jnthn> I have this horrible feeling that...

[11:33] <moritz> but I'm fine with changing it to my

[11:34] <jnthn> ...augmenting the grammar and/or actions triggers the SC write barrier...

[11:34] <moritz> and we end up serializing EVERYTHING?

[11:34] <jnthn> ...which then causes us to re-serialize chunks of stuff

[11:34] <mikemol> It occurred to me last night that Perl 6 is taking some of the philosophy behind ALGOL 68 and attempting to reapply it in a modern context.

[11:34] <jnthn> Likely not EVERYTHING, just everything :)

[11:35] <masak> oh phew

[11:35] <jnthn> Does anything with a user defined op pre-compile? 

[11:35] <jnthn> I'm guessing that this is restricted to custom circumfixes.

[11:35] *** mikemol left
[11:35] <moritz> lemme test

[11:35] <colomon> which are in there...

[11:36] <moritz> are circumfixes subs or methods?

[11:37] <jnthn> subs

[11:37] <moritz> yes, a custom circumfix is enough to trigger that error

[11:37] <jnthn> And fits with reserializing Actions.

[11:37] <moritz> sub circumfix:<_FROM_ _TO_>(*@) { };

[11:37] <moritz> is enough to trigger it

[11:38] <moritz> a custom postfix also blows up

[11:38] <moritz> Serialization Error: unknown static lexical info type for 'postfix:sym<!>'

[11:38] <colomon> If I comment out the custom circumfix, it now givers Serialization Error: unknown static lexical info type for 'infix:sym<⋅>'

[11:39] <moritz> yes, it errors for all new ops, just with different error messages

[11:39] <jnthn> OK.

[11:39] <jnthn> That explains it nicely.

[11:39] <moritz> overloading existing ops is fine though

[11:39] <moritz> because they don't change the grammar

[11:39] <jnthn> Right.

[11:59] *** allbery_b joined
[11:59] <masak> they're clearly related, but note that the reverse one contains TTIAR... so it has to be a special form of sorts.

[12:00] <arnsholt> TTIAR?

[13:01] <uvtc> What's the difference between pick and roll?

[13:01] <phenny> uvtc: 07:57Z <flussence> tell uvtc I think it was caused by trying to use semantically equivalent tags there while avoiding <u>. It does seem a bit wrong now that I've re-read those bits of the HTML spec.

[13:03] <flussence> (I've changed that code to more predictable tags now, btw)

[13:05] <uvtc> hi flussence, I was just looking at that commit. Thanks for the change. One minor nit...

[13:05] <benabik> uvtc: Pick is "select without replacement", roll is "select with replacement"

[13:05] <benabik> uvtc: .pick(*) is a reordering of the original while .roll(*) is an infinite list.

[13:05] <flussence> (as for why that repo doesn't have issues enabled: I dunno. Ask someone who can enable it :)

[13:07] <uvtc> flussence, U<foo> is for "unusual" (according to S26), not "unimportant". I think it would be better to have U<foo> underline (that is, <ins>foo</ins>).

[13:08] <uvtc> benabik, thank you, but I don't know what you mean by "replacement" here...

[13:08] <flussence> S26 may say that, but I'll wait to get a few opinions first because that's a horrible abuse of HTML semantics...

[13:10] <uvtc> flussence, Oh, just noticed that S26 suggests "Unusual (typically rendered with underlining)". Also, when folks see "U<>" they're probably going to think "underline", even though --- as you point out --- its not ideal.

[13:15] <uvtc> masak, I know. Pretty <del>neat</del> sneaky. :)

[13:18] <uvtc> underlining can be useful, for example, in cases where you've added something you want someone to look at before making it final. (Incidentally, I've never seen <mark>foo</mark>, which makes it unusual (to me), seems rather distinctive.)

[13:29] <uvtc> flussence, S26 says that U<> is for text of "minor significance"... If I were marking some text as having "minor significance", I'd probably render it in a lighter shade of grayishness than its surrounding text. Maybe <span class="unusual">foo</span>, then style that in my css file.

[13:38] <uvtc> flussence, Tricky.

[13:39] <uvtc> flussence, people are going to expect I<foo> to yield <i>foo</i> or equivalent (which it does now: <em>foo</em>)

[13:39] <uvtc> flussence, people are going to expect B<foo> to yield <b>foo</b> or equivalent (which it does now: <strong>foo</strong>)

[13:40] <uvtc> flussence, and whether it makes sense or not, people are going to expect U<foo> to yield "foo" underlined, or something vaguely equivalent.

[13:43] <uvtc> flussence, personally, I'd probably defer to Damian/S26 and just make U<foo> yield <ins>foo</ins>. Can folks change the style of that (via css) if they so choose? Haven't tried it...

[13:44] <uvtc> flussence, (just my 2¢, of course)

[13:45] <flussence> if you do that, use <u>, not <ins> (which already has a strongly defined meaning)

[13:46] <uvtc> flussence, Yow. Didn't know about <u>. Thanks. In that case, I think there's what you're looking for (for U<foo>).

[14:00] <jnthn> YOu'd get no compiler warnings anyway.

[14:00] <jnthn> Since methods are late bound.

[14:00] <jnthn> And this doesn't apply to subs.

[14:00] <uvtc> Coke, no, I meant what the syntax means (I think it means, "I'm passing this named argument to the sub, but not passing a value, so just assume it's 'true'")

[14:01] <[Coke]> uvtc: pretty much, yes.

[14:01] <uvtc> Coke, thanks.

[14:01] <masak> specifically, deriving classes add new named parameters. named paramters are optional by default. so (by Liskov-sorta), the base class has to be prepared for them too.

[14:01] <[Coke]> :match is supposed to do something there (but isn't). the other one was me checking to see if a bad name complained (which it doesn't)

[14:01] <[Coke]> jnthn: (compile time) mismatched named parameters don't cause compile time errors ever?

[14:02] <[Coke]> or automatically generated runtime errors? (so if I wanted comb to barf on :barf, I'd have to write my own parameter mangling code to do so?)

[14:03] <jnthn> [Coke]: I didn't say they don't ever. I said they can on subs, and subs don't get a magical *%_, so it all works out there. Methods OTOH are late-bound and do get the *%_

[15:16] <uvtc> sorry: s/that's not rendering/that's rendering/

[15:19] <uvtc> In the synopses, re. the function signatures, is there a place where that function signature notation is explained? For example, at http://perlcabal.org/syn/S32/Containers.html#Array , if I scroll down to "rotate", there's a colon in there, and a *@n --> Array ... not sure what the notation means.

[15:20] *** noam left

[15:25] <lichtkind> uvtc: which colon?

[15:25] <lichtkind> or you mean the asterisk?

[15:25] *** envi_|2 joined
[15:26] <uvtc> There's a few different bits of syntax in those fn sigs that I don't understand. I thought maybe there was a "legend" somewhere that says, "in the function sigs below, here's what we mean by the following..."

[15:26] *** kaare_ joined
[15:26] *** envi_ left
[15:27] <uvtc> Is it real Perl 6 function definition syntax, or an ad-hoc shorthand for describing how to call the various functions/subs/methods?

[15:28] <TimToady> those are supposed to be real syntax

[15:29] <TimToady> --> is just a way of writing the return type inside the sig

[15:29] <TimToady> std: my Int foo ($a,$b --> Str) {...}

[15:29] <p6eval> std fab64fc: OUTPUT«[31m===[0mSORRY![31m===[0m␤Multiple prefix constraints not yet supported at /tmp/78cTECYdmy line 1:␤------> [32mmy Int [33m⏏[31mfoo ($a,$b --> Str) {...}[0m␤Malformed my at /tmp/78cTECYdmy line 1:␤------> [32mmy Int [33m⏏[31mfoo ($a,$b --> Str) {...}[0m␤ …

[15:29] <uvtc> In the method sig for rotate, why is it "@array is copy: ..." instead of "@array is copy, ..."?

[15:29] <TimToady> hmm, that's the wrong message

[15:30] <TimToady> that's the invocat colon

[15:30] <TimToady> *cant

[15:30] <TimToady> @array is the object if the current class

[15:30] <uvtc> is "invocant" == the object on behalf of which the method was called?

[15:31] <TimToady> yes, that's the Perl Culture term for it

[15:31] <TimToady> sort of straddling the notion of whether the object is active or passive

[15:31] <uvtc> (Positive motivational slogan: "Invocant? Invocan!")

[15:32] <uvtc> Ok, so the "-->" is not connected with whatever is to its left. It's just indicating what the method returns.

[15:32] <TimToady> it's looser than : or ,

[15:32] <masak> aye.

[15:33] *** kaleem joined
[15:33] <TimToady> that's why it's bigger

[15:33] <uvtc> Back to the sig for rotate: what's the "*" in "*@n" mean?

[15:33] <masak> slurpy.

[15:33] <masak> means this array parameter eats up all the remaining positional arguments.

[15:34] <uvtc> Oh, of course. Thanks.

[15:34] <TimToady> slurpy binding makes a list context

[15:35] *** spider-mario joined
[15:35] <uvtc> The way I've explained that to myself: The method is expecting a list at that position, and so enforces that expectation on what you pass in there.

[15:35] <TimToady> of course, @array is copy is a rather weird way to write it from an FP point of view

[15:36] <TimToady> in fact, 'is copy' is an FP code smell

[15:36] <TimToady> since it implies you're intending to use a side effect

[15:37] <uvtc> I've always found it a bit of extra work to remember whether or not a given method modifies its invocant.

[15:37] <uvtc> .oO( *these* mutate, *these* don't)

[15:37] *** pernatiy left
[15:38] <masak> TimToady: I can't make that make sense in my head. .rotate doesn't change the original object, it returns a fresh one. which feels very FP.

[15:38] <TimToady> but it is going to do it by modifying the copy

[15:38] <TimToady> rather than just reslicing it

[15:38] <masak> oh, true.

[15:39] <masak> ah, so you're saying that the signature somehow betrays those impure intentions.

[15:39] <uvtc> Is the opposite of "@array is copy", "@array is rw"?

[15:39] *** kaleem left
[15:39] <TimToady> in one sense

[15:40] *** havenn joined
[15:40] *** noam left
[15:40] *** noam joined
[15:42] <TimToady> they're the same from the standpoint of revealing a writeable array to the body of the routine

[15:42] <masak> uvtc: there are three settings: readonly, rw, and copy.

[15:42] <uvtc> I ask because the docs there (in S32/Arrays.html#Array) for push don't say "@array is rw", even though push modifies what you pass to it.

[15:42] <masak> uvtc: the latter two mean that you intend to mutate something. 'rw' means mutate the original, 'copy' means mutate a clone.

[15:42] <TimToady> invocants are assumed to be mutalbe

[15:43] <TimToady> *ble

[15:43] <TimToady> the assumptions of OO are opposite to FP there

[15:43] <uvtc> Oh, that's interesting (assuming them to be mutable). I'd thought t'would be t'other way round.

[15:44] <TimToady> all mutable state is held in objects under OO think

[15:44] <flussence> if one were to have a custom class, is there a way to detect whether it's being used as an "is readonly" so it can throw errors in mutator methods?

[15:46] <masak> that road looks tempting, but will lead to madness.

[15:46] <masak> trouble is, OO as such never bothered to differ between "containment" and "connection". both are attributes.

[15:47] <masak> since there's no good way to tell those two different relations apart, there's no good way to enforce that an object never mutates "its" attributes.

[15:47] <masak> because you can't tell which objects are contained in your object, and which ones are merely cousins.

[15:48] <TimToady> at the moment, the best way to make attributes immutable is to derive a new class to encasulate them in the parent class

[15:49] *** Psyche^ joined
[15:49] <masak> we even have this muddling up in spoken language "The car HAS a motor" (physical containment), "The pond HAS a duck" (incidental containment; kinda dynamical), "Eric HAS a cousin" (in no way is the cousin contained in Eric, though)

[15:49] *** dakkar joined
[15:50] <TimToady> .oO(more declarators!)

[15:50] <masak> sometimes in the literature, that last relation is called KNOWS_A. but... it's already too late.

[15:50] <masak> I'm not sure it could be made formal and usable even if we tried. the world is just too messy.

[15:51] <TimToady> that's why OO is so big on encapsulation, because *mess* is what's being encapsulated

[15:51] *** havenn left
[15:52] <TimToady> even in FP-land, an object can present as immutable on the outside, but be running all sorts of mutable caching on the inside as an optimization

[16:54] *** kaleem joined
[16:58] <uvtc> What's the difference between `my %h = ();` and `my %h = {};`?

[16:58] <uvtc> (to start yourself off with an empty hash)

[16:59] <PerlJam> uvtc: "my %h;"  gets you an empty hash

[16:59] <uvtc> Oh, so it does. Thanks, PerlJam.

[17:01] *** PacoAir joined
[17:03] *** fglock left
[17:03] <masak> uvtc: `my %h = ();` creates a list, and the runtime has to drop the contents into a new Hash. `my %h = {};` creates a new Hash.

[17:04] <uvtc> Does `my %h;` really create the hash, or is it autovivified (correct term?) only when you add the first pair to it?

[17:05] *** geekosaur joined
[17:05] <masak> uvtc: yes.

[17:05] <masak> :P

[17:05] <PerlJam> heh

[17:05] <masak> uvtc: as far as I know, it's really created, and is defined, and all that.

[17:06] <masak> pmichaud has been wondering whether it should be created in an undefined state, due to features I clamored for many years ago.

[17:07] <PerlJam> What would be the up-side of creating an undefined Hash?

[17:08] *** allbery_b left
[17:09] <TimToady> working more like scalars do

[17:10] <TimToady> the ability to say %hash //= ...

[17:10] <masak> right.

[17:10] <PerlJam> makes sense

[17:11] <masak> in fact, the angle I had when doing lots of complaining (in RT bug reports, no less) was that it wasn't possible to tell from inside of a routine whether a parameter had been passed or not.

[17:11] <masak> that's sort of the same initialized/not-initialized distinction, if you squint.

[17:11] *** mikemol joined
[17:11] <TimToady> more like the Nil distinction, methinks

[17:11] <PerlJam> masak: but I could pass an undefined hash as the parameter  :)

[17:12] <masak> PerlJam: indeed you could.

[17:12] <masak> and the issue was never resolved. neither the real-world one nor the RT one :)

[17:12] <TimToady> Nil is an encapsulated semi-predicate problem :)

[17:13] <TimToady> it's a do-what-I-mean when I mean there's nothing here really

[17:22] <spider-mario> http://ompldr.org/vZGtuaw

[17:23] <[Coke]> so, "git clean -xdf && perl Configure.pl && make 2>&1 | tee build.log", or so?

[17:23] <[Coke]> spider-mario: ... you're using a pre-installed NQP?

[17:23] <[Coke]> and not the one that comes with?

[17:23] <spider-mario> I am packaging nqp and rakudo for arch

[17:24] <spider-mario> in two packages

[17:24] <spider-mario> I am done with nqp, I think

[17:24] <spider-mario> it builds and installs fine

[17:25] <spider-mario> (and I am packaging tarballed releases)

[17:25] <spider-mario> (nqp 2012.04.1 and rakudo star 2012.04)

[17:26] <[Coke]> so why is star involved if you're packing individually?

[17:27] <[Coke]> or did I misread star

[17:27] <[Coke]> ?

[17:27] <spider-mario> it makes no difference whether I build rakudo or rakudo star

[17:28] *** eviltwin_b joined
[17:28] <spider-mario> (but I’m making one package for nqp and one for rakudo star)

[17:28] *** lichtkind left
[17:28] <spider-mario> (or “the rest of” rakudo star, if you consider nqp to be part of it)

[17:29] <[Coke]> given that it's bundled inside star, ja.

[17:29] <spider-mario> is it?

[17:29] <[Coke]> yes!

[17:29] <spider-mario> oh, it is

[17:30] <spider-mario> but, well, parrot is already a separate package on arch

[17:30] <[Coke]> star is a distro. which is why I was confused that you're re-distro-ing it. ;)

[17:30] <[Coke]> what is "arch" ?

[17:30] <spider-mario> I thought it’d make sense to split nqp out of it as well

[17:30] <spider-mario> arch linux

[17:30] *** geekosaur left
[17:31] *** rualdo11 left
[17:31] <sorear> good * #perl6

[17:31] <sorear> masak: hi

[17:32] <[Coke]> ok. if I had access to a box running arch, I'd probably verify that a standalone star works. (let it build everything that it shipped with and install it in the default location.) 

[17:32] <[Coke]> then I'd try to build star using the installed NQP (making sure it's the same as the one that ships, which it sounds like you did.)

[17:33] <spider-mario> a standalone star from git works

[17:33] <spider-mario> not sure about the 2012.04 tarball

[17:33] <spider-mario> (I’m speaking of rakudo now)

[17:34] <spider-mario> I don’t know why I’m saying that I don’t know

[17:34] <spider-mario> I am tired :(

[17:36] <[Coke]> rakudo star or rakudo compiler ?;)

[17:36] <spider-mario> :)

[17:37] <[Coke]> (standalone star from git) the star in git isn't standalone.

[17:37] <[Coke]> you need the /tarball/ to get the star release.

[17:37] <spider-mario> it isn’t, but its Configure.pl does fetch the appropriate nqp and parrot

[17:37] <[Coke]> star in git is just for people who release star. (which you kind of are, but not exactly. ;)

[17:37] <moritz> and the README says so

[17:38] <[Coke]> I'm assumig you're getting the wrong nqp somewhere.

[17:38] <[Coke]> so if a self-contained (even if from git) star works, that's a plausable theory.

[17:38] <spider-mario> actually, the reason why it still failed seems to be that I forgot to change a path in the PKGBUILD, so makepkg wouldn’t clean before building

[17:38] <[Coke]> do you have multiple nqps or parrots installed in your system dir?

[17:38] <moritz> star is a distribution. If distributors want to take the star distro, that's fine

[17:39] <spider-mario> so I had leftovers of the compilation with 4.2

[17:39] <[Coke]> yay.

[17:39] <spider-mario> and it seems to work now

[17:58] <masak> is that clear from the release guide?

[17:59] <uvtc> jnthn, ^^

[18:01] <sorear> masak: git log v<last>...HEAD

[18:01] <jnthn> uvtc: Yeah, I'd expect it to work that way.

[18:01] <uvtc> Should I file a bug report?

[18:03] <TimToady> if you're referring to .delete{} not working, that's expected

[18:03] <uvtc> TimToady, yes, thanks. Why is it expected?

[18:03] <TimToady> because .delete doesn't return anything you can subscript

[18:04] *** allbery_b joined
[18:04] <TimToady> rakudo provides the .delete() workaround to the absense of .{}:delete

[18:05] <TimToady> spec uses the latter because subscripting is potentially more complicated than can fit easily into a method's arguments, and does magic with semicolons for multiple dimensions

[18:05] <uvtc> TimToady, sorry, I don't understand. Just to be clear, I'm talking about this paste https://refheap.com/paste/2475 where perl6 crashes (and returns me to my shell prompt).

[18:05] <uvtc> TimToady, it looks to me like I'm creating a hash,

[18:05] <uvtc> TimToady, then trying to delete one item/pair in it,

[18:06] <uvtc> TimToady, but it's failing. Whereas, it works if I create the hash in a slightly different manner.

[18:06] <masak> sorear: ok, sounds easy enough.

[18:06] <sorear> uvtc: You invented the %h.delete{foo} syntax.

[18:06] <TimToady> but you haven't specified which element to delete--the .{} syntax happens after the .delete

[18:06] <moritz> and it should still not crach the REPL

[18:07] <jnthn> uvtc: ah, it crashes here too when spread over two lines.

[18:07] * jnthn wonders why on earth it does that.

[18:07] <sorear> masak: anything else?

[18:07] <jnthn> ah

[18:07] <jnthn> Failure()

[18:07] <TimToady> well, the final error message is correct-ish, there's no .{} defined on the List returned, but the prior messages are kinda bogus

[18:07] *** eviltwin_b left
[18:07] <uvtc> Oh! Hah. Sorry. I was using curlies instead of parens!

[18:08] <jnthn> moritz: Is there some issue with Failure being handled in the repl?

[18:08] <uvtc> Whoopsie. Sorry about that. :)

[18:08] <TimToady> there are far too few brackets in ASCII for Perl 6 not to care about the difference :)

[18:08] <TimToady> as it is, {} are overloaded a bit more than is comfortable

[18:09] <TimToady> though not as heavily in P6 as they were in P5

[18:09] <uvtc> kids are even wearing them on their teeth!

[18:09] * TimToady has Invisaligns® instead

[18:09] <uvtc> Brace yourselves!

[18:10] <TimToady> I believe P5 overloads braces 6 different ways (at least)

[18:10] <moritz> jnthn: oh, might be

[18:10] <moritz> jnthn: when we stringify a Failure, it goes Boom. That's by design.

[18:10] <jnthn> moritz: ah, yeah...

[18:11] <jnthn> And then boom goes the repl with it...

[18:11] <moritz> so we should probably catch that

[18:11] <TimToady> Do, or do not--there is no try...

[18:11] <moritz> but there is a CATCH :-)

[18:12] <TimToady> I guess Perl 6 proves that there isn't always a CATCH.

[18:12] <jnthn> moritz: yeah.

[18:15] <moritz> jnthn: shall I try to fix it?

[18:16] <jnthn> moritz: Go ahead...I need to make some food here. :)

[18:33] <flussence> .oO( maybe int should initialise to a random value, like C : )

[18:34] <TimToady> then we could rewrite rogue in Perl 6, and preproduce the superarrow bug

[18:34] <TimToady> s/pre/re/

[18:35] <masak> TimToady: not sure whether or not I agree that NaN represents uninitialized... but doesn't the spec say native things initialize to their zero?

[18:35] <masak> I think that's much more sensible, at least.

[18:35] <masak> again,

[18:35] <jnthn> The spec says that native nums initialize to NaN

[18:35] <masak> r: say my int $a

[18:35] <p6eval> rakudo 1c92d0: OUTPUT«0␤»

[18:35] <jnthn> I remember having it as 0 and having to go fix it.

[18:35] <masak> jnthn: oh, ok :/

[18:36] <masak> well, it seems an unnecessary default to me. and inconsistent with the int case.

[18:36] <uvtc> Oh, @a.splice(...) splices in-place. Didn't expect that. Thought I'd have to do @a .= @a.splice(...) ...

[18:36] <TimToady> S02:1229

[18:36] <masak> I'd rather have an array of nums fill up with zeroes than with NaNs.

[18:37] <uvtc> Er, sorry: s/@a .= @a.splice/@a .= splice/

[18:37] <masak> but I won't push it. there doesn't seem to be general assent to it being the wrong default.

[18:38] <TimToady>  = 0 xx *;  # how hard can it be?

[18:38] <PerlJam> depends on how many times we have to type it.

[18:39] <masak> TimToady: what's the use case for the default of an array full of NaNs?

[18:40] * jnthn afk for a bit, dinner

[18:40] <masak> I can give you three use cases right off the bat for the default of an array full of zeroes.

[18:40] <TimToady> blowing up when you can't know whether 0 is valid or not; it's a form of the semi-predicate problem

[18:41] <TimToady> sub zero { 0 xx * }

[18:41] <TimToady> = zero

[18:42] <masak> NaN doesn't blow up. it propagates silently through calculations.

[18:42] <TimToady> indeed, and that is a feature

[18:42] <masak> it's a bit similar to C's not initializing arrays at all, so they come to life filled with garbage.

[18:42] <TimToady> that's spelled '= *' in Perl 6

[18:43] <TimToady> (when applied to native arrays)

[18:44] <masak> you mean 'my num @a = *;' ?

[18:44] <TimToady> that would be more like the original superarrow bug in rogue

[18:44] <TimToady> yes, same spec paragraph I pointed to before

[18:44] <TimToady> probably only for shaped arrays

[18:44] *** geistteufel left
[18:45] <masak> ah, there it is. thank you.

[18:45] <TimToady> my int @a[10] = *;  # garbage

[18:45] <masak> I imagine it only works in a declaration :)

[18:45] <TimToady> my int $arrowhits = *;  # :)

[18:46] <PerlJam> .oO( Why would you *want* garbage? )

[18:46] *** geistteufel joined
[18:47] <TimToady> my int @a[MAXINT] is addr(0) = *;  # all of memory :)

[18:48] <PerlJam> though the text does say "whatever was already there" .... maybe you've got a custom allocator behind the scenes giving your nums some special values.

[18:48] <TimToady> more likely, you do that in hot code because you know (or think you know) that all the elements will be set by the algorithm anyway, and initializing will just slow it down

[18:49] <TimToady> but in the case of remapping a block of memory, you generally don't want to initialize it.

[18:51] <TimToady> though I suppose 'is addr' could suppress that too; maybe = * should really be an 'is uninitialized' trait or some such

[18:51] <TimToady> then addr implies uninitialized, maybe

[18:52] <PerlJam> wfm

[18:52] <TimToady> come to think of it, 'is rw' is already implying lack of initializaiton when used on a parameter

[18:54] <TimToady> and = * is a bit short, huffmanly speaking, for something that can get you into trouble if you prematurly optimize

[20:00] * TimToady is so tired of github's putting a narrow column of useful data down the middle of a sea of polar ice on both sides

[20:01] <masak> my github doesn't do that.

[20:01] <masak> and my screen is pret-ty wide.

[20:02] <TimToady> maybe it's a ff thing

[20:02] <masak> oh! of course, with the default text zoom, it's quite silly.

[20:02] <masak> but I do Ctrl + nowadays without thinking.

[20:02] <masak> I'd rather do that than strain my eyes.

[20:03] * TimToady uses NoSquint

[20:03] <masak> reading Chinese characters (and hearing horror stories about Chinese-lang scholars) taught me to go easy on the eyes :)

[20:03] * jnthn doesn't notice it, but probably due to a relatively low resolution (again, for the sake of the eyes)

[20:03] <TimToady> otoh, for editing my CJK character descriptions, I CTRL+ my term 4 times

[20:03] <masak> TimToady: how's http://strangelyconsistent.org/ on that account?

[20:04] <TimToady> pretty okay; a few weird wraps when the text is zoomed more than the box holds, but other than that, pretty okay

[20:05] <masak> \o/

[20:06] <TimToady> maybe they're optimizing for iPhone or something...

[20:07] * TimToady hates the modern trend toward phone-as-GUI unification

[20:07] <masak> sorear: first snag: `make spectest` two levels down into next/next gives 'make: t/run_spectests: Command not found'

[20:07] <masak> sorear: `make spectest` in the niecza directory itself seems to work, though.

[20:08] <TimToady> I don't have a mouse in order to pretend I'm making touchscreen gestures...

[20:08] <masak> TimToady: I hate when websites say they're "optimized for the iPad", and that means you can't use the website on the iPad, and have to download their crappy app instead.

[20:08] <masak> which costs money.

[20:09] <masak> lessons from running 'make spectest' on Niecza: the spectest suite is full of potential difficulties and undefinedness warnings.

[21:00] <masak> (because you can write it as p/q, where q is some power of 10)

[21:13] <uvtc> Sorry there. Time running out for me today. jnthn: it sounds like rakudo tries to keep things as accurate as possible (using Rats), only resorting to floats when it has to (for example, as you point out, when you use e for exponent, or when you multiply by pi or e (base of natural logs)).

[21:14] *** allbery_b left
[21:14] *** baest joined
[21:14] <uvtc> But since the string representation of Rats looks just like floats, it appears to me that the casual user doesn't even need to be aware of Rats.

[21:14] *** brrt left
[21:15] <jnthn> uvtc: Yes, there's very much a sense of trying to do the right thing. :)

[21:15] *** kaare_ left
[21:15] <uvtc> jnthn, Very good. :)

[21:19] *** uvtc left
[21:20] <masak> right, the idea is not to bother the type-unaware user with types.

[21:21] * jnthn is probably somebody who finds it a little hard to imagine being type-unaware when learning a language, even though it's not at all unusual to be.

[21:21] *** geekosaur left
[21:22] <gfldex> you can get pretty far without types in javascript
