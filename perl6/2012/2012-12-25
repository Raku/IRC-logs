[16:35] <rindolf> Hi all.

[16:35] <rindolf> And Happy Christmas.

[16:38] *** sftp joined
[16:39] <cognominal> rindolf:  Happy Perlmas. we probably are in 1 BPE.   1 year Before Perl 6 Era.  :)

[16:41] <cognominal> then, I don't know if we start to count from 0 or from 1.

[16:42] <rindolf> cognominal: OK.

[16:42] <rindolf> It's always 1 year before Perl 6 Era.

[16:48] <cognominal> speaking of era, the ethernet era is not over yet, I need to buy an ethernet adaptator for my macbook

[16:55] <xenoterracide> the last advent reminds me... I noticed a distinctive lack of 'last_day_of_month' options in the temporal modules... and Date couldn't take now() to mean today  (which, incidentally, also would make a better sane default than christmas )

[16:56] <moritz> cognominal: not over by far. Ethernet allows you to do cool stuff like VLANs :-)

[17:01] <xenoterracide> I ultimately would need last_day_of_month for credit card objects.

[17:14] <moritz> xenoterracide: then implement it, spec it, test it

[17:14] <moritz> and spell it with last-day-of-month instead :-)

[18:38] <moritz> huh, why do (nearly) all the links on doc.perl6.org have curly braces around them?

[18:50] *** noggle joined
[18:54] <cognominal> my compassion to mst does not help me much to understand what is a block link.

[18:57] <mst> moritz was asking why the doc.perl6.org links all say {link}

[19:02] *** GlitchMr left
[19:03] <cognominal> mst: you think you are joking about Perl but there is indeed something named a block link in html5. http://simplyaccessible.com/article/html5-block-links/    Like always dropping some context can help. You think you are smart, you act  condescendant, and you come out as plain ignorant.

[19:04] <mst> I made a pun based on the {} - it wouldn't've been a good pun if there wasn't such a thing as a block link

[19:04] *** lolage joined
[19:05] <cognominal> I would be reductionnist if I said I just came with a good mst characterisation.  :)

[19:06] <mst> I was trying to avoid murdering a bad joke by explaining it; if you can manage to make people see the pun without fully explaining it then it's bad manners not to at least try

[19:08] <mst> "dropping some context" doesn't work for puns, it kills them stone dead

[19:09] <cognominal> thar art is about dropping enough context but not too much.

[19:11] <mst> which I did, the second time you asked for a hint

[19:11] <cognominal> s/that/the/

[19:11] <pmurias> moritz: control flow,objects,grammar no bigints yet

[19:12] <pmurias> * grammars

[19:13] <pmurias> moritz: the grammars support is very partial

[19:13] <mst> then for some reason you decided to start insulting me, which I'm ignoring because #perl6 prefers to err on the side of politeness

[19:13] <mst> and that's an important thing about the culture in here, so  you'll find people who've been around for a while try their best to follow it

[19:18] <pmurias> moritz: the object support will be much better once I figure out a sane way of having a setting in nqp, and I can reuse the how's

[20:21] <timotimo> pmurias: do you have an estimation when nqp-js will be somewhat useful for front-end javascript work for browser/DOM scripting?

[20:22] <timotimo> i suppose there could be nqp modules to make using jquery or canvas or what ever exists in that shiny, strange and foreign world of JS in the browser ...

[20:23] <timotimo> ... easier.

[20:28] <pmurias> timotimo: that depends on the definition of somewhat useful

[20:28] <timotimo> because i quite don't know what i'm doing when it comes to HTML and JS. so you don't have to hurry anyway. or expect greatnes :D

[20:29] <pmurias> timotimo: it's far away from making things easier then with plain js (which I think would require rakudo-js)

[20:29] <timotimo> so maybe i'd use something else instead?

[20:30] <pmurias> but I think I could get something usable for simple thing by tommorow ;)

[20:30] <pmurias> timotimo: js+jquery seems the simplest thing

[20:31] <timotimo> there's lots of higher level languages that 'compile' to js. maybe i'd try one of those. i thought perhaps nqp-js would be somewhat similar

[20:31] <timotimo> but i see the design goal is something different

[20:33] <pmurias> timotimo: why do you want to use a language that compiles to js?

[20:34] <pmurias> timotimo: making things easier?

[20:34] <timotimo> well, js in a browser seems to me the closest i get to a GU-like Interface without having to learn to use niecza and GTK#

[20:35] <pmurias> and you want to use Perl 6?

[20:35] <timotimo> oh, that is the question? yes, i'd like things to be easier, because i'ven't ever done js+html properly before

[20:36] <timotimo> and since this is a "learn perl6! yaaaay" project, and at the same time you talked about nqp-js, so i thought maybe there's some use ni that

[20:37] <timotimo> anyway, it's about bedtime for me, so i'll better get going. have a good *, everyone :)
