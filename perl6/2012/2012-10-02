[02:06] <diakopter> is this valid C code:  if (1);

[02:07] <sorear> yes

[02:08] <diakopter> cool

[02:08] <diakopter> I have an opportunity to use it

[02:08] <sorear> that is a valid C statement.  it does nothing.

[02:08] <sorear> you can shorten it to just ;

[02:08] <diakopter> uhm.

[02:08] *** buubot_backup joined
[02:08] <diakopter> surely you don't think I was asking about the case where 1 is there in particular

[02:09] <sorear> actually I did

[02:09] <diakopter> I would have thought it was pretty clear I was asking about the lack of statement after the condition

[02:09] <sorear> there is a statement after the condition

[02:09] <sorear> ; is legal anywhere C expects a statement

[02:10] <diakopter> I... .... am *surprised* ... you thought I was asking whether 1 was a valid condition.  what kind of moron do you take me for?

[02:11] <geekosaur> huh?\

[02:11] <sorear> I'm just trying to answer the questions without regard to who's asking

[02:12] * shachaf took the question the same way.

[02:12] <diakopter> ok. thanks for the info that ; is always a valid statement. I knew it was ok after while () but I wasn't sure about if.

[02:13] *** buubot_backup left
[02:13] <sorear> actually I thought you were asking whether "if (1);", as a whole, was valid

[02:14] <diakopter> yes, but that would be an insane question because it's obviously a no-op

[02:14] <diakopter> I mean, who would ask how to write a no-op?

[02:14] <sorear> I think it's best not to second-guess people's questions.

[02:15] <diakopter> I don't see any "second-guessing" there at all.

[02:16] <diakopter> I see deduction from assumption of sanity and pragmatism

[02:17] * shachaf wonders what context makes "if (...);"  useful.

[02:18] <shachaf> Anyway, "sanity" is a pretty vague thing, and figuring out edge cases of C can be tricky enough when you assume that people say what they mean. :-)

[02:18] <diakopter> if (a || b || c || d) { return; } at the end of a void function

[02:18] <shachaf> Does (a || b || c || d) have side effects?

[02:18] <diakopter> nope

[02:18] <shachaf> Then what's the point?

[02:19] <diakopter> I was just curious if I could shorten the { return; } to ;

[02:19] <shachaf> You can, but you can also shorten the whole thing to either nothing or "(a || b || c || d)".

[02:21] <diakopter> ah

[02:21] <diakopter> sorry I'm wrong; yes they do have side effects

[02:21] <diakopter> they are each CAS operations

[02:22] <shachaf> OK, then you still don't need the if.

[06:34] <sjohnson> mathw: what's the main source of grief?  lack of job satisfaction?  boring tasks?  annoying coworkers?

[06:35] <mathw> it's a very small company, so it basically boils down to one coworker who just doesn't think the same way I do

[06:35] <mathw> almost always takes the shortest path to a solution

[06:36] <sjohnson> i hear ya

[06:36] <mathw> and is very fond of giving me a task then implying it's my fault when I don't manage to include this obscure bit of it that he never told me about

[06:36] <mathw> he's never had to produce proper specs before, because he's never had to communicate them to another programmer

[06:36] <mathw> not that he wants to be a programmer anyway

[06:37] <mathw> the best bit about this job is that I got to learn Dancer and write some serious Perl 5

[06:37] <sjohnson> well, you're not alone

[06:37] <mathw> yeah it's just hard to take because I had an idyllic job with a terrifyingly intelligent colleague who thinks a lot like me (but different enough for us to reinforce each other's weak points) but the company's been having trouble and they couldn't keep me on full time anymore

[06:40] <sjohnson> :[

[06:40] <mathw> so that job's more annoying now because we can never deliver in the time frames they got used to

[06:40] <mathw> becaues we don't have as much time as we did!

[06:41] <mathw> even my productivity-per-day has gone down, because there's a context-switching penalty involved in this

[06:41] <mathw> plus more time (proportionally) spent dealing with user support

[06:44] <sjohnson> it is kind of amazing why something so simple would be so hard for managers to understand

[06:45] <mathw> I don't want to leave the good job, but if I have to... well, I have to

[06:45] <moritz> hard choices are hard

[07:05] <grondilu> do I have to reinstall panda or something?

[07:06] *** atrodo left
[07:06] <sorear> you have to tell rakudo to recompile the modules.

[07:07] <sorear> I'm not sure how best to do that, but just using panda to reinstall the modules should be enough...

[07:07] <sorear> alternately, you can delete the precompiled modules

[07:07] <sorear> which should be .pir files in ~/.perl6 or something like that

[07:07] <sorear> but IANA rakudo expert.

[07:08] * grondilu tries removing *.pir files

[07:10] <sorear> IANA rakudo user, for that matter, so take everything I say carefully

[07:11] <grondilu> well, now I can run panda at least.  It takes a long time though, since nothing is precompile anymore.

[07:24] <sorear> o/ sqirrel

[07:27] <aharoni> Hallo. How can I check that I have the right version of ICU for building Rakudo? (I'm running Ubuntu.)

[07:28] <sorear> aharoni: I guess you could start the "Configure.pl" script, stop it when it starts building Parrot, then check to see what Parrot's configure thinks about your ICU

[07:30] <aharoni> sorear,  I already ran `perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot --gen-nqp' once, and it cloned everything, so if I run it again, it finishes very quickly and doesn't say anything about what it did or didn't find. Even after I did `make realclean'.

[07:30] <aharoni> Or did you mean that I should run `make' and see what it says about ICU?

[07:31] <sorear> aharoni: maybe try grep has_icu parrot/config_lib.pir

[07:32] <aharoni> set $P0["has_icu"], "0"

[07:32] <aharoni> does "0" mean that I don't have it?

[07:32] <moritz> correct

[07:32] <moritz> --gen-parrot doesn't rebuild if there's a parrot already there

[07:33] <moritz> what you can do is

[07:33] <moritz> rm -rf install/

[07:33] <moritz> and then run  perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot   again

[07:35] <aharoni> aha, "Is ICU installed....................................yes"

[07:36] <aharoni> maybe it's because I installed libicu_dev after running Configure for the first time.

[07:36] <aharoni> But I didn't know that I should delete install/ before re-building. I assumed that `make realclean' would take care of it.

[07:37] *** Patterner left

[07:59] *** cognominal joined
[08:02] <aharoni> When I didn't have ICU installed properly, S02-types/version.t tests with Greek letters failed. After installing libicu_dev and re-building, they pass.

[08:02] <TimToady> back to Tokyo from Nikko (along with jnthn & ingy)

[08:02] <aharoni> Should I maybe add a comment about this to S02-types/version.t?

[08:03] <sorear> aharoni: you should modify t/spectest.data and add the NEEDS_ICU marker or however that's spelled to the S02-types/version.t line

[08:03] <sorear> there are a number of test files that Rakudo autoskips if ICU is not available

[08:04] * aharoni wonders what other tests it auto-skips.

[08:04] <moritz> grep icu t/spectest.data

[08:05] <aharoni> I would actually love it not to skip Unicode-related tests, given that I care about foreign alphabets a lot.

[08:06] <jnthn> oops, forgot to type...

[08:06] <aharoni> sorear, moritz, i huess that the marker is `# icu'

[08:06] <aharoni> a comment in the end of the line.

[08:06] <sorear> aharoni: why test something that is known a priori to fail?

[08:07] <sorear> jnthn, aharoni needs to know the history of ICU in Parrot

[08:07] <sorear> also, goof afternood

[08:08] <aharoni> sorear, If you don't care about Unicode and don't want to install ICU, then it's fine to skip it. But without that failure that I had I wouldn't even notice that I don't have ICU installed properly.

[08:08] <aharoni> (Although I would probably notice it after some time.)

[08:09] <aharoni> Is there maybe some make target than runs everything without skipping?

[08:10] <jnthn> History? Parrot used to bundle ICU within it and I spent ages getting the Windows build of it to work and if you had a Parrot you had an ICU, iirc. They they tossed it out of the repo and now some people have ICU and some done.

[08:10] <jnthn> I've no idea how to do it these days.

[08:10] <jnthn> s/done/don't

[08:10] <aharoni> On Ubuntu it's just a matter of installing libicu_dev.

[08:10] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm on Windows.

[08:11] <aharoni> Oh.

[08:11] <jnthn> I don't see ICU as our long-term or even medium-term solution anyways.

[08:12] <aharoni> Anyway, how can I submit a patch that marks these tests as ICU-dependent? http://rakudo.org/how-to-help/ says to ask on IRC :)

[08:12] <jnthn> But yeah, it's needed for doing Unicode stuff on Rakudo today

[08:13] <jnthn> aharoni: Add the # icu markers.

[08:13] <sorear> aharoni: make a patch, then either post it on irc using a pastebin, or via a github pull request, or a github ticket with patch, or whatever else suits you

[08:13] <jnthn> aharoni: Then create a patch and send it to [email@hidden.address]
[08:14] <aharoni> Oh, GitHub, of course. I just cloned and didn't even look at github.com :)

[08:14] <aharoni> OK.

[09:19] <sorear> it's funny.  from what I've seen in the past, I thought lestrrat was generally opposed to the concept of videoing talks, yet yapc::asia has the promptest videos I've seen yet

[09:19] <lestrrat> sorear: huh? what made you think that way?

[09:20] <TimToady> sorear: you sure you aren't confusing lestrrat++ with someone else?

[09:20] <lestrrat> I AM against ustream'ing, if you ask :)

[09:21] <lestrrat> but I don't think I've gone and talked about it much :)

[09:21] <sorear> http://blogs.perl.org/users/yapceurope_2012/2012/02/video-recordings-for-yapceurope-2012.html#comment-122259

[09:22] <lestrrat> Ah, I must have been thinking ustreaming but typed otherwise, or something.

[09:22] <sorear> what's ustreaming?

[09:23] <lestrrat> people around here likes to http://www.ustream.tv/ their conferences (I don't know about europe or na)

[09:23] <lestrrat> i.e. stream it live

[09:23] <lestrrat> also, we lower the quality of our videos.

[09:23] <lestrrat> on purpose.

[09:23] <lestrrat> that's what I wanted to say in that comment, I think.

[09:24] <lestrrat> since I was asked "I think - without wanting to say anything bad or picky - that video could be even cooler, perhaps with respect to the readability of the slides. "

[09:24] <lestrrat> to which I was like, "well, yeah, I can give you some video, but not the real thing" 

[09:25] <sorear> now what I would *really* like in the conferences is some way to make the days longer so that you don't have to schedule interesting talks against each other

[09:25] <sorear> 24 hours is never enough

[09:26] <lestrrat> I'd hate that. the organizers would have to work longer hours ;)

[09:26] * sorear cannot speak for yapc::asia specifically but had many painful decisions to make at ::europe

[09:27] <lestrrat> yeah, I purposely put interesting talks back-to-back. otherwise you get one room full, and the other room empty. that's bad for the non-rock-star speakers. demotivates them a lot.

[09:27] <TimToady> at ::asia it largely comes down to whether you understand very rapid„ÄÄÊó•Êú¨Ë™û.  :)

[09:27] <TimToady> gets easier to choose if you don't :)

[09:27] <lestrrat> the language barrier is one of the reasons why we are making the videos and slides available so quickly 

[09:28] <lestrrat> most JP people probably didn't understand what (exactly) larry was saying at the venue,

[09:28] <sorear> probably for the best I didn't go, then.  my Êó•Êú¨Ë™û listening comprehension skills are basically nonexistant

[09:28] <lestrrat> but they can figure it out if they watch the videos carefully.

[09:29] <TimToady> which is why I picked something that can largely be understood by reading the code on the screen

[09:29] <TimToady> though if they can't see that from the video, it'd be a problem

[09:29] <sorear> lestrrat: what goes into making the videos presentable?  why do na and europe take months?

[09:29] <lestrrat> sorear: Right, but you don't need Japanese or English to understand stuff like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C7Ngq6bM4M :)

[09:30] <lestrrat> sorear: beats me. we just have an HD handycam on each room, and just download, cut, and upload. done.

[09:30] <lestrrat> I have no clue why it would take more than a week or two to do the above work.

[09:31] <sorear> lestrrat: is that the reduced quality version?

[09:31] <lestrrat> yep.

[09:32] <sorear> I guess I need new glasses, because I can't see any unusal blurring :D

[09:32] <sorear> or rather, "it seems in focus to me :D"

[09:33] <lestrrat> well let me just put it this way: if we used the original quality video, you would be able to see the scratches on the projector screen. it's full HD.

[09:33] <lestrrat> TimToady: I meant to ask you - since you did live coding, you have no slides, right?

[09:33] <lestrrat> just wanted to make sure.

[09:34] <sorear> well I had better head off to sleep.

[09:34] <sorear> lestrrat++ 941++ # even if I didn't go I consider this a valuable community service

[09:34] <sorear> &

[09:34] <lestrrat> thanks. g'night

[09:35] <mhasch> lestrrat: "live coding" might still have been prepared in advance... :-)

[09:35] <TimToady> lestrrat: in a sense I had 1377 slides

[09:35] <lestrrat> meh :)

[09:35] <TimToady> since it was a vim keystroke file

[09:36] <lestrrat> oh, so you can actually repro the entire step ?

[09:36] <TimToady> but one can see teh before and after on rosettacode.org :)

[09:36] <TimToady> in the Perl 5 and Perl 6 entries for strand sort

[09:36] <TimToady> but yes, I can repro the whole thing

[09:37] <lestrrat> I think a lot of the people there were wondering how you were typing with one hand :) let me know if you feel like posting that keystroke file somewhere 

[09:37] <mathw> I like this ocncept

[09:38] <mathw> (sorry, too tired to type properly this morning)

[09:38] <mathw> vim keystroke file as presentation tool. Very cool.

[09:40] <TimToady> the technology has a few rough edges yet

[09:40] <TimToady> you have to be very careful not to use screen-relative commands like H

[09:41] <mathw> I imagine setting it up is quite tedious

[09:41] <TimToady> well, depends on how safe you want it to be

[09:42] <TimToady> every command saves and restores the current position in my file, so if I accidentally or purposefully  move the cursor, it starts up again that the correct spot

[09:42] <TimToady> but that clobbers your position if you do j or k across a short line, so I had to compensate for that too

[09:42] <TimToady> and my popups didn't work quite right

[09:43] <TimToady> not surprising since I hacked that capability in within the hour before the talk :)

[09:43] <Su-Shee> can't you just make it a "filetype" and just disable the keystrokes for this foobar.mysuperpresentation filetype?

[09:44] *** arnsholt_ is now known as arnsholt

[09:44] <TimToady> also, inserts go in all as a single transaction, when you'd want to simulate typing one char at a time sometimes

[09:45] <TimToady> I'm sure there are lots of capabilities within vim that I haven't explored; I was trying to do the simplest thing that would work, and that was a little more complicated than what I used in ::eu, which didn't quite work

[09:45] <mathw> Something tells me that one day there'll be a Perl script which produces files vim can digest from a friendly specification

[09:46] <Su-Shee> I love the idea though. :) I never warmed up with anything "real presentation" like, I usally made everything html.. 

[09:46] <mhasch> you'd also have to pay a price for more flexibility (shortcuts and elaborations)

[09:46] <Su-Shee> mathw: vim has a perl api, you can just enable it or use vimscript.

[09:46] <TimToady> what the popups did was start a gnome-term with zoom=3 or so, fullscreen

[09:47] <TimToady> I'd hit a return to exit that, and then I was back in vim

[09:47] <Su-Shee> I made a note "look into vim as presentation tool" for me. :)

[09:47] * TimToady wasn't trying to use embedded Perl

[09:47] <mathw> Su-Shee: then I'd have to learn vimscript :)

[09:47] <mathw> Which I don't really object to, but it would be more fun to write something in Perl 6 or Haskell

[09:48] <Su-Shee> mathw: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-vim-script-1/index.html and there's a part 2, 3, 4 and 5 too.

[09:48] <TimToady> my vim script is all of three lines

[09:48] <TimToady> map <F12> :let feed = readfile(input("vs: ", "x", "file") . '.vs')

[09:48] <TimToady> map <Insert> :call feedkeys((len(feed)?remove(feed,0):''),'t')

[09:49] <mhasch> TheDamian mentioned a little project "vimpoint" back in '08 or so; dont' know whether he pursued it further.

[09:49] <TimToady> map   <Insert>:

[09:49] <TimToady> that's supposed to be a ^V-space

[09:50] <TimToady> oh, I had to write a program to take a keystroke file and split it into separate lines per command

[09:51] <TimToady> I couldn't find any way to get vim to update the screen if I didn't come back to a user prompt on each command

[09:51] <mathw> I will admit to an influence from my colleague, who needed to generate an invoice so wrote an invoice-generating program.

[09:52] *** FROGGS left

[09:53] <mhasch> TimToady: did ^L not work?

[09:53] <TimToady> didn't seem to

[09:53] <TimToady> I tried lotsa things

[09:54] <mathw> huh

[09:54] <TimToady> in the end I decided doing each command when I type space as a macro gave me more flexibility anyway

[09:54] <TimToady> it certainly gave me the capability of recovering in ::eu when my cursor got off from where it belonged

[09:56] <mathw> which is definitely worthwhile

[10:00] <aharoni> I am very much a newbie, but I suspect that S32-io/IO-Socket-INET.pl creates the file server-ready-flag for testing and doesn't delete it.

[14:52] <sirrobert> ahhh... I see my issue

[14:52] <sirrobert> the repl doesn't keep $/ from one command to the next.

[14:55] <sirrobert> flussence: hm!  I didn't know that

[14:55] <FROGGS> feels a little bit like javascript

[14:55] <sirrobert> I guess it's returning a Regex which uses a postcircumfix operator '<>' to access named captures?

[14:55] <mathw> oh yes you can save match objects

[14:55] <p6eval> rakudo 3d31af: OUTPUT¬´Match()‚ê§¬ª

[14:57] <mathw> it's a Match object, which contains the results of a regex match operation, and it implements the necessary roles to let you access named captures in a hash-like way and numbered captures in a list-like way

[14:57] <sirrobert> cool

[14:57] *** thou joined
[14:57] <mathw> so you can use postfix [] for numbered captures

[14:58] <sirrobert> ahh, that's cool

[14:58] <mathw> and {} and <> and ¬´¬ª for named ones

[14:58] <sirrobert> and the special var $/ stores "last created Regex" ?

[14:58] <mathw> that's the Match object from the last match operation

[15:00] <mathw> the Regex object just has the pattern in it, Match is where the action is once you start doing things

[19:58] <GlitchMr> Perl 6 debugger is awesome: https://gist.github.com/3822919

[19:58] <sirrobert> So, I have a hash.  When I try to "say %.hash.perl" the program pins the CPU at 100% (even in the debugger).  How can I inspect it?

[19:58] <GlitchMr> But it looks better in action, with colors

[19:59] <GlitchMr> sirrobert: it's probably recursive hash then

[19:59] <GlitchMr> Currently, Perl 6 freezes on recursive hashes

[19:59] <sirrobert> What's a recursive hash?

[19:59] <sirrobert> a hash with itself as one of the elements?

[20:27] <aharoni> In the documentation of Types at doc.perl6.org, there are many specifications that say something like "multi sub    chr(Int:D ) returns Str:D"

[20:28] <aharoni> What does the <:D> stand for?

[20:28] <moritz> defined

[20:28] <moritz> ie Int:D allows 1, 2 or 3 but not the Int type object

[20:29] <aharoni> I'm not sure that I understand the difference.

[20:31] <sirrobert> (moritz's was more thorough =)

[20:31] <aharoni> OK, I understand the difference now, but I'm not sure what is f(Int) good for. Can I do anything with that object?

[20:31] *** birdwindupbird joined
[20:31] <moritz> sure

[20:31] <moritz> you can use it for type checking, for example

[20:31] <moritz> or for creating new instances

[20:32] <moritz> or for introspection

[20:32] <sirrobert> typechecking is the big deal (imho):

[20:32] <moritz> r: say grep Int, 1, 2, 'string', ['arr', 'ay']

[20:32] <p6eval> rakudo c1ddea: OUTPUT¬´1 2‚ê§¬ª

[20:32] <moritz> there I pass the Int type object to the grep() function

[20:33] <sorear> or for type-friendly semipredicates, Maybe-style

[20:33] <sirrobert> my Int $foo; #do something else#; some_func($foo);

[20:33] <sirrobert> You don't know if $foo is defined or not at runtime, say.

[20:33] <sirrobert> But it does have to be an Int.

[20:33] *** kurahaupo joined
[20:34] <aharoni> Ah, finally found it in http://perlcabal.org/syn/S12.html .

[20:34] <aharoni> I would expect it to appear in S03 - Operators, but I don't see anything like it there.

[20:35] <moritz> well, actually S06 is about subroutines, and the signatures belong to subroutines

[20:35] <moritz> so I'd expect it in S06, or maybe S02, beause everything is in S02 :-)

[20:36] <aharoni> I couldn't find it in S02 either. Of course, it's possible that I don't understand what to look for.

[20:37] <moritz> indeed, it's only in S12

[20:40] <sirrobert> What's the difference that makes the second one of these hang:

[20:40] <p6eval> rakudo c1ddea: OUTPUT¬´("a" => 1).hash‚ê§¬ª

[20:45] <benabik> sirrobert: I don't think ,= does what you think it does.

[20:45] <sorear> sirrobert: my $foo = {}; $foo ,= {a => 1} # $foo is now self referential

[20:45] <sirrobert> benabik it does in the first example...

[20:45] <benabik> I think it's creating something recursive.

[20:45] <sirrobert> hmm

[20:45] <sirrobert> why does the first one work?

[20:47] <sirrobert> huh

[20:47] <sorear> sirrobert: don't use ,= ever, it's very wasteful

[20:47] <sirrobert> I can *see* that the difference is $ vs %, but I don't understand why.

[20:47] <sirrobert> sorear: what's a better way to concatenate two hashes?

[20:47] <sirrobert> ,= was suggested

[20:48] <sirrobert> or "merge" two hashes

[20:48] <sorear> can't you use .push for that?

[20:49] <sorear> anyway

[20:49] <sirrobert> I dunno

[20:49] <sorear> $foo ,= {} expands to $foo = $foo, {}

[20:49] <sorear> or rather $foo = ($foo, {})

[20:49] <sorear> $foo may be a hash, but the variable itself doesn't know that

[20:49] <sorear> so after that statement, you are left with $foo being a Parcel pair ($foo, {})

[20:49] <sirrobert> the reason that's a bummer is that means I can't do things like:  %hash<x> = {...};
