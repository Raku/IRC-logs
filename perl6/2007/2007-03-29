[01:41] <dduncan> I just read something interesting.  Apparently the FSF considers the Artistic License 2.0 to be compatible with both the GPL v2 and GPL v3.  In my interpretation, this means that if someone, eg the Perl Foundation wants to license Perl 6 under Artistic as an option, and not strictly under the GPL alone, then Perl 6 can simply be licensed under the Artistic 2.0 alone, rather than specifying a GPL disjunction ... anyone can still relicens

[01:42] <dduncan> FYI, I got this from section 4.5 of the new gpl3-dd3-rationale-FINAL.pdf document.

[07:55] <dduncan> TimToady, your last large patch seems to have messed some whitespace, either leaving 2 blank lines or zero lines in a few places where 1 would be wanted

[07:55] <dduncan> the zero is the worst case ...

[07:55] *** elmex joined
[07:56] <dduncan> that is, the [ =head1 PDL signatures] has no blank line before it now

[07:57] <dduncan> extra blank above [ =head1 The semicolon operator]

[07:58] <dduncan> also, there is no blank line under [-=head1 Negative subscript dwimmery]

[07:58] <dduncan> nevermind the last one

[08:00] <dduncan> come to think of it, all the double blank lines are above =head1, so maybe you're doing that on purpose?  If so, it would be good to make that more consistent

[08:01] <dduncan> but regardless, the [ =head1 PDL signatures]  is the most important to look at

[08:01] <dduncan> with zero blanks

[14:26] <masak> from S09: 'Note that the square brackets are a compile-time declarator, not a run-time operator, so you can't use the "dotted" form either'

[14:27] <masak> why is it a compile-time declarator?

[14:27] <gaal> the compiler can allocate a static buffer

[14:28] <masak> gaal: but array element values are changed at runtime

[14:28] <masak> isn't that the idea of an array?

[14:28] * masak has the feeling he's mixing up levels here

[14:28] <gaal> the brackets there only indicate width

[15:20] <ajs> gaal: I would think that "my @hackers[*];" would create an array that can be arbitrarily sized. On the other hand, I would expect that "my @hackers[Inf];" would run out of memory and fail (perhaps at compile time).

[15:23] <gaal> I acknowledge your distinction, but don't agree that the compiler has to fail. It may decide to be lazy about initialization.

[15:24] <ajs> The compiler might not, you're correct, but since you're asking for a fixed array of infinite size, something needs to give.

[15:24] <ajs> Of course, a sane compiler will just say "no"

[15:24] <ajs> Compilation failed at line 1: ENO

[15:24] <ajs> ;)

[15:26] <ajs> Mathematically speaking, Inf isn't an integer, so it would be fair for the compiler to say, "fixed array declarations must specify an integer, 0, or *"

[15:27] <moritz> actually Inf is an acronym meaning "Inf not finite" ;-)

[15:27] <ajs> And as all integers are, by definition, finite...

[19:57] <wolverian> oh. I thought the perl trademark was wider.

[19:57] <wolverian> thakns.

[19:57] <wolverian> er, thanks. 

[19:57] <moritz> I'll read http://www.perlfoundation.org/legal/trademark.html

[19:57] <wolverian> the onion is very cute, btw.

[20:00] <moritz> well, the website above does not mention rules of using the name perl

[20:01] <DarkWolf84> i can't find anythind obout trade mark

[20:01] <DarkWolf84> maybe Perl is not a trademark

[20:01] <DarkWolf84> but I don't know

[20:01] <DarkWolf84> I'm not sure

[20:03] <wolverian> I think it's only when used with the onion logo.

[20:04] <Tene> Limbic_Region: the last thing I saw her say was that some stressful events had occurred, and she needed to disappear for a day or so to recover.

[20:06] *** forsaken joined
[20:07] <forsaken> can anyone tell me the apparent status of perl6? is it coming along well?

[20:07] <forsaken> i feel like it has been in development forever

[20:08] <Tene> It's coming along well.

[20:10] <moritz> forsaken: it has been in development for ~10 years, but now we have a p6 interpreter that can handle a large subset of the language

[20:10] <moritz> pugs

[20:10] <PerlJam> 10 years is little too long.

[20:10] <forsaken> thats cool

[20:11] <forsaken> so they're trying to get it working in pugs? then parrot?

[20:11] <PerlJam> more like it's been in-design for about 7 years and in-development for about 3 years.

[20:11] <moritz> PerlJam: which sums up to 10 years ;-))

[20:11] <PerlJam> moritz: except my 7 and 3 overlap at the end :)

[20:11] <moritz> forsaken: the final p6 interpreter will be written in p6, and run on parrot

[20:11] *** diotalevi joined
[20:12] <moritz> forsaken: and pugs will bootstrap p6

[20:12] <forsaken> cool

[20:12] <moritz> PerlJam: that's neglectible ;))

[20:12] <PerlJam> forsaken: there are 3 (at least) roughly independent perl6 implementations.

[20:12] *** Aankhen`` joined
[20:12] <forsaken> any idea how long until there's a fully working version/release?

[20:12] <PerlJam> forsaken: haskell, perl 5, and parrot.

[20:12] <PerlJam> forsaken: depends on how you define "fully"  :-)

[20:12] <moritz> forsaken: christmas - but we don't know which year ;)

[20:12] <DarkWolf84> hehe

[20:13] <forsaken> heh, figured as much :)

[20:13] <DarkWolf84> some sites point this year

[20:13] <PerlJam> forsaken: There should be an alpha release of the parrot-based perl6 this year.

[20:13] <moritz> and once p6 is released every day will be like christmas ;)

[20:14] <forsaken> neat :)

[20:14] <forsaken> so hopefully sometime next year we'll have a version that works pretty well

[20:14] <DarkWolf84> btw I can't work with parot  yet

[20:14] <DarkWolf84> and pugcc not work

[20:14] *** prly joined
[20:15] <PerlJam> DarkWolf84: you mean you can't use parrot with pugs?  or something else?

[20:15] <DarkWolf84> for me the rleasing perl will be like chrismass for me too

[20:15] <Limbic_Region> Tene - thanks

[20:15] <DarkWolf84> yes

[20:15] <DarkWolf84> it gives me an error

[20:16] <PerlJam> ah, yes.  Pugs and parrot haven't kept too much in sync lately, so maybe that's the problem.

[20:16] <PerlJam> (I haven't really tried using them together since it got all wonky)

[20:16] <DarkWolf84> and I don't find the way to translate perl without pugs

[20:17] <DarkWolf84> mean perl6

[20:17] *** the_dormant joined
[20:17] <DarkWolf84> and pugs compiler backend not work

[20:18] <fglock> DarkWolf84: hmm - translate perl6 to what?

[20:18] <DarkWolf84> to bytecode or usable program

[20:18] <PerlJam> personally, I like playing with parrot/pge/tge more than perl6(pugs) these days

[20:19] <DarkWolf84> btw pugs compil only in memory like perl5

[20:19] <PerlJam> mainly because parrot is "unspecced" enough that I don't expect more from it that it can deliver whereas perl6 is specced enough that I'm disappointed when pugs doesn't live up to the spec.

[20:20] <DarkWolf84> how works this

[20:20] <Tene> PerlJam: the spec always leads the implementation.

[20:20] <jrockway> heh, perl5 and cpan got to where they are today thanks to detailed specs

[20:20] <jrockway> oh wait

[20:21] <moritz> jrockway++ *lol*

[20:21] <DarkWolf84> perl6 is in development right now

[20:21] *** snoop0x7b joined
[20:21] <jrockway> not saying that specs are bad, i'm just quipping

[20:22] <DarkWolf84> specs r good

[20:22] <PerlJam> Tene: of course, but what I'm say is that for parrot the spec and implementation are on par (are in a similar state of disarray)

[20:22] <DarkWolf84> but when the perl6 is ready

[20:22] <PerlJam> Tene: but pugs/perl6 spec, the spec is quite a bit more organized

[20:22] * Tene nods.

[20:22] <DarkWolf84> i think there wil be cpan6 too

[20:22] *** polettix joined
[20:22] <avar> too bad that perl6.pir is so incomplete

[20:23] <DarkWolf84> it's only a matter of time

[20:25] <forsaken> hows the work on parrot coming? it seems like a neat idea

[20:33] <shamu> is there a ubuntu package of the current pugs build?

[20:33] <shamu> something I could install and uninstall cleanly to test with?

[20:35] <shamu> cool, thanks.  Is it in a state where it automatically packages smoothly using the debian build scripts?

[20:35] <moritz> shamu: well, it could...

[20:35] <moritz> shamu: first of all, these are my "private" packages, not official ones...

[20:35] <shamu> just curious, really

[20:35] <shamu> oh, sure.

[20:36] <moritz> shamu: and they build cleanly most of the time, but the build process consumes much CPU and RAM...

[20:36] <moritz> shamu: so I only trigger it when I leave my laptop for half an hour ;)

[22:04] *** ludan joined
[22:06] *** eden_c left
[22:18] <dduncan> yeah, lots of good stuff in there

[22:19] <dduncan> if I understand it right, that deals effectively with the issue of custom indicies

[22:19] <Aankhen``> Oh, quite a large portion of it went over my head. :-P Whatever I did understand, though, has me drooling.  But I seem to say that every time I see a new feature...

[22:19] <dduncan> now I just want to know how to declare anonymous multidim values

[22:20] <dduncan> my impression is that @foo{...} syntax means custom index, while @foo[...] means normal index

[22:20] <Aankhen``> Indeed it does.

[22:20] <dduncan> that difference alone goes a long way to understandability of code in my mind

[22:20] *** Psyche^ joined
[22:21] <dduncan> and lets users of the same array have it both ways, while reducing certain complexity

[22:21] <moritz> and my impression is that pugs currently does not implement multi dim arrays

[22:21] <Aankhen``> Well, it would save a lot of trouble... instead of use constant { POS_FOO => 0, POS_BAR => 1, POS_BAZ => 2 }; my @quux = (); $quux[POS_FOO] = ...

[22:22] <Aankhen``> You could just have my @quux{ <Foo Bar Baz> } # sorry if I messed up the syntax a bit!

[22:22] <dduncan> anyway, I posted my multidim question to p6l yesterday, but no response there yet

[22:22] <Aankhen``> Yeah, I read the question.  The syntax you posted makes sense to me, FWIW.

[22:22] <dduncan> though it may be bad in the ; having different meanings, and that example would only work for 2-dimensional structures

[22:23] <dduncan> for n-dimensional, we need some kind of nesting syntax

[22:23] <dduncan> meaning, bracket-like syntax

[22:24] <dduncan> sort of like perl 5's array-of-array-of... but not exactly the same, since aoa are different things than multidims, afaik

[22:24] <dduncan> and perl 6 still has the other aoas

[22:24] <Aankhen``> I'm not sure I understand what multislices are. :-S

[22:25] <dduncan> more broadly speaking, I think of multidims sort of like a mapping where the key can have multiple parts, 1 part per dimension ... which is more direcltly what the multidim hash means, afaik

[22:25] *** silug joined
[22:26] <dduncan> in fact, in that respect, it would be loosely the case that a multidim hash could implement an n-ary relation, with one dimension being one "attribute"/"column", and one element being one "tuple"/"row" ...

[22:26] * moritz thinks this is a cause for multidimensional confusion ;)

[22:27] <dduncan> that said, I won't hold my breath for this actually being the best way to implement it

[22:27] <Aankhen``> moritz: Heh.

[22:28] <dduncan> I say more like a multidimensional keyset though, since all parts of the element would be in the key

[22:28] <dduncan> anyway, I won't go on about this until I've made my proof of concept relation the old-school way

[22:28] <Aankhen``> Good luck!
