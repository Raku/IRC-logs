[13:57] <rgs> question:

[13:57] <rgs> X.contains(any @$_)

[13:58] <rgs> that means that X contains every element of @$_ ? or at least one ?

[13:58] <moritz_> what's the semantics of method contains?

[13:58] <rgs> X is a hash

[13:59] <moritz_> S29 doesn't list "contains" as a method

[14:00] <moritz_> anyway, the test $x == any(@list) will succeed if $x is equal to at least one of @list

[14:01] <moritz_> so if contains() doesn't accept a junction, it will be rendered to X.contains(first elem) or X.contains(second elem) or ...

[14:01] <rgs> moritz_: I got that code straight from the S03 you pointed me to on P5P :)

[14:01] <moritz_> at least that's my understanding of authreading

[14:01] <moritz_> rgs: damned ;)

[14:01] <rgs> ok

[14:01] <moritz_> i think it will succeed if it contains one of @$_

[17:36] <moritz_> dlocaus: ah, I see, thanks

[17:36] <dlocaus> I used to be good at table tennis.  My GF tried to get me interested in "tennis", but I kept on putting a spin on the tennis ball.

[17:36] <dlocaus> apparently that's very bad sportsmanship..

[17:36] <moritz_> ;)

[17:38] <moritz_> dlocaus: I noticed that the effect of spin is different in table tennis and tennis... 

[17:39] <moritz_> table tennis: the angle between ball and racket changes

[17:39] <moritz_> tennis: just the trajectory of the ball changes

[17:39] <dlocaus> fglock: I've been scratching my head about something.  KP6 uses an AST to convert the perl6 code to language "X", one of which will be parrot.  KP6 can also use the AST to convert the perl6 code to perl6.  But, why are we writing the backend for the perl6 language?  I understand that it so that we can test out the compilation, but if that is the case, then can we just use the perl6::(insert perl5 module name here) instead of re-writi

[17:40] <fglock> dlocaus: we need the "perl6 backend" in order to convert back AST to source code,

[17:40] <dlocaus> moritz_: I wish I knew, all I know about physics is imperical evidence and not to try and not to play chicken with an 18 wheeler truck.

[17:40] <fglock> for example, for implementing macros

[17:40] <dlocaus> "back AST"?

[17:41] <fglock> AST back to source code

[17:41] <fglock> and for debugging, too

[17:43] <moritz_> think of it as B::Deparse

[17:43] <fglock> yes

[17:44] <dlocaus> but if we are depending on parrot to do some of the really dirty work for us, namespacing, inheritiance, binding issues, why are we doing the backend?  If we are just trying to translate the backend do we really need the runtime engine?

[17:46] <moritz_> one of the goals of kp6 is to stay portable

[17:46] <fglock> hmm - kp6 is perl6-in-perl6, not perl6-in-parrot

[17:46] <dlocaus> sorry, /if we are just tyring to translate the backend/if we are just trying to translate perl6/

[17:47] <fglock> but yes, the kp6 side of the parrot runtime should be really simple

[17:48] <fglock> if parrot does the dirty work 

[17:49] <dlocaus> Isn't there a perl5 project to write a perl5 compiler in parrot?

[17:49] * [particle] kicks a dead ponie

[17:49] <dlocaus> opps.

[17:49] <moritz_> that was ponie, and discontinued some years ago

[17:49] <fglock> dlocaus: yes, there have been more than one

[17:50] <PerlJam> dlocaus: feel free to revive the ponie if you want :-)

[17:50] <dlocaus> PerlJam: sorry, I don't have enough time to try and even pull that off :). Its taken me quite a while, before I could even ask intelligent questions in KP6 :)

[17:50] <fglock> i've got a secret plan to write a perl5 compiler using kp6 :P

[17:51] <fglock> hmm - i can't commit

[17:52] <dlocaus> I hate this bootstraping compiler idea, it is so darn hard to wrap my mind around it.

[17:52] <fglock> dlocaus: have you checked out MiniPerl6? it's much simpler

[17:53] <dlocaus> No, a few days ago, I finally had that lightbulb go off on KP6.

[18:31] <dlocaus> EWWW

[18:31] <dlocaus> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagna

[18:31] <dlocaus> The word "lasagna" is derived from the Greek word "lasanon" meaning chamber pot.[3][4] The word was later borrowed by the Romans as "lasanum" to mean cooking pot. The Italians then used the word to refer to the dish in which what is now known as lasagna is made.

[19:56] <dlocaus> pmurias: Sometimes, I get confused by why something is happening, then I convert the perl6 code into the ::DISPATCH(...) mess, and read what is going on from that presepective

[19:56] <dlocaus> The problem is I end up having to clean up the perl5 ::DISPATCH into something "simpiler"

[19:57] <dlocaus> it would be good to have the perl6 code or something of that nature, to "document" what is going on.

[19:57] <TimToady> if you just want the original for reference, s/^/#\t/mg works pretty well.

[20:03] <dlocaus> In contrast          <ident> !~~ ^ 'moose' $       would allow any identifier containing "moose" as long as it is not equal to "moose". For clarity it might be good to use extra brackets:

[20:03] <dlocaus> How does that work?

[20:04] *** jisom joined
[20:04] <dlocaus> what about ^ 'moose' $ says "the id can contain moose, but cannot be /^moose$/?

[20:05] <pugs_svn> r18975 | fglock++ | [kp6] more Array x List

[20:06] <[particle]> ^ and $ anchor the pattern

[20:06] <[particle]> ...to the beginning and end of the string

[20:07] <dlocaus> but what enforces the requirement that it must have "moose" in it?

[20:07] <[particle]> so, ^ 'moose' $ only matches a string with the five letters: moose

[20:08] <dlocaus> but for the rule <ident> !~~ ^ 'moose' $ 

[20:08] <dlocaus> would it match "ThisIs_moose"

[20:08] <[particle]> !~~ is the opposite of ~~

[20:09] <dlocaus> right, so it should be that the rule <ident> !~~ ^ 'moose' $ 

[20:09] <dlocaus> would match everything that does not match in perl5: /^moose$/ correct?

[20:09] <dlocaus> $ident !~ /^moose$/;

[20:10] <[particle]> (phone)

[20:11] <TimToady> it also requires the match of an identifier, and the !~~ is a submatch anchored to the beginning and end of that identifier

[20:11] <TimToady> even if embedded in a longer match

[20:13] <dlocaus> I thought white space was "for appearances" only if not specified as being required?

[20:13] <pmurias> S05: 495

[20:13] <dlocaus> IE, if it was present, it doesn't necessary have to match something

[20:13] <pmurias> dlocaus: yes

[20:14] <dlocaus> But, TimToady said that it requires the match of the identifier.

[20:15] <pmurias> !~~ takes <ident> as the left parameter

[20:15] <dlocaus> so 

[20:15] <dlocaus> <ident> !~~ ^ 'moose' $  

[20:15] <dlocaus> would be in perl5  $ident !~ /^moose$/ && $ident =~/\b?moose\b?/;

[20:16] *** Limbic_Region joined
[20:16] <pmurias> dlocaus: ident is a subrule 

[20:16] <Tene> dlocaus: yes, that would also match identifiers not containing "moose" at all.

[20:16] <TimToady> more like $ident =~ /^([a-zA-Z]\w*)$/ and $1 ne 'moose'

[20:17] <dlocaus> but the documetnation said that it must have "moose" in it

[20:17] <TimToady> the !~~ negates that

[20:17] <dlocaus> that was the documentation for that.

[20:17] <dlocaus> In contrast          <ident> !~~ ^ 'moose' $       would allow any identifier containing "moose" as long as it is not equal to "moose".

[20:18] <dlocaus> 'would allow any identifier containing 'moose' as long as it [the identifier] is not equal to moose

[20:18] <pmurias> wouldn't it be more like /(?!moose)(??{$ident})/

[20:18] <TimToady> except the lookahead isn't necessarily anchored the same

[20:18] <Tene> pmurias: that would disallow "moosables"

[20:19] <TimToady> dlocaus: yes, it allows "schmoose", "moosed", etc, just not "moose"

[20:19] <pmurias> Tene: sorry

[20:19] <Tene> TimToady: but wouldn't it also allow "orange", "water", "xxxxxxx", etc?

[20:19] <Tene> Identifiers that don't contain 'moose' at all?

[20:19] <TimToady> certainly, it allows those too

[20:20] <Tene> dlocaus is asserting that it claims to only allow identifiers that contain 'moose', or can be read as such.

[20:20] <TimToady> the sentence is not intended to be exclusive

[20:20] <dlocaus> Tene: I am not asserting that, the documentation says that.  That was a quote from the documetnation

[20:21] <Tene> dlocaus: the text is ambiguous about exclusivity.

[20:21] <dlocaus> ah, I get it now.

[20:21] <TimToady> the "In contrast" says it's to be read in the context of the previous

[20:22] <TimToady> no, because then it wouldn't say what I want it to say either

[20:22] <TimToady> but I will fix it

[20:23] <dlocaus> so: 'would allow any identifier containing "moose" as'

[20:23] <dlocaus> should be changed to: 'would allow any identifier (even one containing "moose") as long as it does not match /^moose$/

[20:25] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - 1 year and 26 days until Xmas?

[20:26] <TimToady> Perhaps Perl comes of age on her 21st birthday, and will immediately drink herself into oblivion

[20:26] <Limbic_Region> oh wait, next year is a leap year

[20:27] <Limbic_Region> well, if I were a betting man I would feel comfortable betting next year's Xmas would be The Xmas

[20:29] <TimToady> we're getting darn close to the bootstrap, if I can just get my head swelled long enough to encompass the longest token matcher.  after that it doesn't matter if my head shrinks

[20:30] <dlocaus> maybe an early x'mas next year?

[20:32] <TimToady> productizing the whole thing will take a goodly long time.

[20:32] <dlocaus> "productizing"?

[20:33] <PerlJam> Having a usable-in-production perl6 is a good first step  :)

[20:33] <TimToady> making it slick enough that you don't have to have a Masters in Sysadmin to install.

[20:34] <PerlJam> TimToady: Having adequate documentation to fend off "I think X should be in core" people would be good too.  

[20:34] <dlocaus> I didn't know there was a degree for System administration, I always thought good sys admin's were forged.

[20:35] <PerlJam> dlocaus: mastery is when they call you a bofh

[20:35] <Limbic_Region> PerlJam - better yet - "here is the spec and tests - write your own implementation with whatever you want core and it is still perl 6"

[20:35] <pugs_svn> r18978 | fglock++ | [kp6] t/kp6/69-list-binding.t resolved

[20:36] <PerlJam> Limbic_Region: as far as productizing goes, I think we should build the first few perl6 distributions.  perl6-web, perl6-database, perl6-kitchen-sink, etc.

[20:37] <dlocaus> for http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/src/KindaPerl6/Grammar.pm

[20:37] <TimToady> maybe should name them perl6-slackware, perl6-debian, perl6-fedora, etc.

[21:10] <[particle]> ^--- jedi mind trick

[21:10] <TimToady> if you even glance at toke.c in a mirror, it will drive you mad

[21:10] <pmurias> :)

[21:10] <pmurias> even if you are mad already?

[21:11] <dlocaus> I thought perl comments were stripped from the dynamically generated byte code.

[21:11] <TimToady> if anything could make you madder, it would be toke.c

[21:11] <pmurias> got to try ;)

[21:12] <dlocaus> is there an svn server for perl5 that I can take a peek at?

[21:12] <TimToady> dlocaus: sure, but it's got to remember the current line number for error messages somehow

[21:12] <TimToady> and #line is not treated like an ordinary comment

[21:12] <dlocaus> I seam to recall that perl5 was on perforce?

[21:12] <dlocaus> I wonder what other wunderous perls are in toke.c?

[21:13] <TimToady> rsync -avz rsync://ftp.linux.activestate.com/perl-current/ .

[21:13] <jjore-m> dlocaus, if you look for "intuit" you'll see some neat stuff.

[21:13] <pmurias> dlocaus: #line is documented in "Programming Perl"

[21:13] <TimToady> let's put it this way.  there are 7 or 8 different ways a lexer can "cheat".  toke.c does them all.

[21:14] <pmurias> page 590 in the polish edition (althought i doubt you have that one)

[21:15] <dlocaus> I'm looking in the English Cammel book (US engish if there is a distinction)

[21:15] <TimToady> each of the ways to cheat individually screws with your mind, and toke.c intermeshes them all simultaneously.

[21:16] <TimToady> and above that the compiler cheats several more ways, just to make sure the compilation looks to be done in "one pass", while propagating context information every whichaway.

[21:17] <dlocaus> its 618 in the English Camel book.

[21:17] <dlocaus> that is really intersting.

[21:17] <TimToady> not to mention building the execution order on the fly

[21:18] <TimToady> so that by the time you get to the end of, say, a BEGIN block, it's ready to execute already.

[21:19] <dlocaus> oohh... I should have just downloaded a compressed version of it....

[21:19] <TimToady> s/you get/the parser gets/

[21:19] <TimToady> the -z does compression on the rsync already

[21:19] <TimToady> and this way you get "bleadperl".  :)

[21:20] <pmurias> OT: does anyone remember what was the data stucture for geting the number of elements in a given range (1..interger) called,it worked by storing the number of elements up to powers of or similarly

[21:20] <dlocaus> oh geez.

[21:20] <dlocaus> what a copyright statement on toke.c

[21:21] <dlocaus> 1991-2007

[21:22] <fglock_> home &

[21:23] <TimToady> Yeesh.  All I can say is, it's a good thing I was smarter when I was younger, or we'd never have got Perl 5.  :)

[21:23] <pmurias> * structure,integer,powers of 2

[21:23] <pmurias> TimToady: but now you're wiser and we will have Perl 6 ;)

[21:24] <dlocaus> wow, the perl5 code looks very nice. Well documented and formated

[21:25] <TimToady> well, dunno about wiser--more treacherous, anyway.

[21:25] <TimToady> dlocaus: that part wasn't my fault  :)

[21:26] <TimToady> as in "Old age and treachery will overcome youth and skill."

[21:26] <dlocaus> S_incline here it is

[21:27] <dlocaus> perl has really spoiled me.

[21:28] <dlocaus> I can barely remember how annoymous variables work in C

[21:28] <moritz_> with malloc ;)

[21:28] <TimToady> they actually work?  neat!

[21:28] <[particle]> it's a twelve step process

[21:29] <TimToady> Step 1: admit you have a problem...

[21:29] <moritz_> Step 2: install perl

[21:29] <dlocaus> its stuff like this:     if (strnEQ(s, "line", 4))

[21:29] <dlocaus> where is "line" stored? on the stack? in some constants area?

[21:30] <TimToady> up to the compiler

[21:30] <dlocaus>  :)

[21:30] <TimToady> a sufficiently smart compiler might turn that into if (s[0] == 'l' && s[1] == 'i' etc

[21:30] <dlocaus> yea,.. and if you modify it what happens?

[21:31] <TimToady> modify what?

[21:31] <dlocaus> well

[21:31] <dlocaus> strnEQ(char *s, char *s2, int ) {

[21:31] <dlocaus>    strcpy('weee',s2);

[21:31] <dlocaus> }

[21:32] <allbery_b> gcc will stow "line" in read-only storage

[21:32] <allbery_b> unless told otherwise

[21:32] <dlocaus> c knows about read-only storage?

[21:32] <TimToady> but in the good old days it was just "Doctor, it hurts when I do this..."

[21:33] <moritz_> dvorak: the question is if your assembler knows about it ;)

[21:33] <allbery_b> dlocaus:  it does have "const"

[21:33] <moritz_> s/dvorak/dlocaus/ # sorry

[21:33] <allbery_b> and the type of a string literal is (const char *)

[21:33] <dlocaus> I last worked with C about 15+ years ago.

[21:33] <allbery_b> the standard allows it to put those in r/o, and gcc does so these days

[21:33] <dlocaus> I can read it, and I know I've shot myself in the fut with it.

[21:34] <dlocaus> I thought it was quite possible to just confuse C to death.

[21:34] <allbery_b> (flip side, it's entirely possible for the compiler to recognize that a string constant with NUL will fit in a register and compare it *that* way)

[21:34] <allbery_b> it's not so much that you can confuse C as that you can confuse yourself (or others reading your code)

[21:35] * dlocaus is a bit more used to a flakey assembler.

[21:35] <allbery_b> then again, that is true of certain other languages as well :>

[21:35] <moritz_> ORLY? ;)

[21:36] <dlocaus> When I was programming C, I would do amusing things like create variables on the stack, and then later use free( stackVaraible) to release it.

[21:36] <pmurias> dlocaus: what was the point?

[21:36] <dlocaus> no point, it was just a lousy bug for me to hunt down.

[21:37] <dlocaus> which is one of the reasons, I REALLY like perl.

[21:37] <dlocaus> and if the stack ptr was high enough when it was created, sometimes, the bug didn't express itself.

[21:37] <dlocaus> or until much later, when the stack got over written.

[21:38] <moritz_> you can use valgrind these days to find such bugs

[21:38] <TimToady> well, in general C is a lot of accidents waiting to happen simultaneously

[21:38] <dlocaus> The problem was I passed the pointer around so many times, I forgot that the original structure was allocated from the stack.

[21:38] <dlocaus> -oopps-

[21:40] <dlocaus> OT: My all time favorite bug... well, there is 2 of them.  1.  I accidently double incremented on a circular loop pointer.  Thus, on even valued circular loops, the code would hang, on odd valued circular loops, the code would work fine.   My 2nd all time favorite bug... well, I forgot to throatal the email for some warnings, and after a major crash the code dumped 900 emails into my bosses cell phone.

[21:42] <TimToady> you mean that wasn't on purpose!?!?

[21:43] <dlocaus> the emails? yeah... it was funny "How the HELL am I going to delete these emails?"

[21:43] <dlocaus> needless to say the snickering got back to the other end of the line.

[21:44] <dlocaus> I think it would be a good email service to offer.  To throatal email for people.

[21:44] <dlocaus> Send an email to [email@hidden.address] with subject "[white list] ...", then throtal the email to that account

[21:44] <dlocaus> it would forwarded the email to an address predetermined by the user.

[21:45] <dlocaus> Since, many cell phones have a 10 or 5 cent fee, this would be a good service.  And backed up emails could be read on line or just mass deleted.  It would be a limited market though
