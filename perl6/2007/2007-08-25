[02:12] <Limbic_Region> oh

[02:12] <Limbic_Region> ok then, nevermind

[02:13] <Limbic_Region> I was just going to ask if there were anyway to return values from a sub/method that wasn't positional since you can provide arguments to a sub/method in a myriad of ways

[02:13] <TimToady> hmm

[02:14] <TimToady> well, return is defined to return a Capture, so that isn't always positional

[02:22] * Limbic_Region was just thinking about that today

[02:23] <Limbic_Region> An OO module I wrote had a return object with a handful of standard members which made it easy to deal with in the calling code

[02:23] <Limbic_Region> easy with respect to standardization in subclasses and what not

[02:25] <TimToady> that's more or less what a Match object is supposed to do, but pugs doesn't make it easy to derive from Match, alas

[02:26] <Limbic_Region> well, my wife is telling me it is time for bed so perhaps I will bug you to explain more tomorrow

[21:24] <Eidolos> (to displace PIR for that)

[21:24] <Eidolos> I'm not sure what KP6 is :)

[21:24] <Eidolos> except that it's similar

[21:24] <markstos_> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/FAQ.pod

[21:25] <markstos_> The FAQ talks about a "parrot backend", but it's clear that this is meant to involve NQP, or direct PIR code. 

[21:25] <Eidolos> hmm, maybe KP6 is the end goal of the 6-in-6 project

[21:25] <Eidolos> NQP is pretty new, so I don't know about that

[21:26] <markstos_> I tried NQP today. It had good performance...much better than my experiments with pugs or P6-on-P5. 

[21:27] <markstos_> I just about to write up a little blog entry about the experience, but I wanted to get my facts and relatioships straight. 

[21:27] *** rindolf left
[21:27] <Eidolos> I'll defer to someone who actually has a clue :)

[21:27] * Eidolos hasn't been following too closely

[21:32] <fglock_> kp6 is mean as a full Perl6 implementation, but before it bootstraps, the source code only uses a subset of Perl6

[21:32] <fglock_> meant

[21:33] <fglock_> several kp6 runtime modules are already compiled by kp6

[21:36] <markstos_> Thanks for the answer, fglock_

[21:37] <markstos_> So, does it use "NQP" as a backend at all? How is the parrot backend of kp6 used?

[21:42] * markstos_ is downloading v6 0.19 now. 

[21:42] *** fglock joined
[21:43] <fglock> kp6 could use parrot through the emitters that were developed for mp6, but they are still quite incomplete

[21:43] *** justatheory left
[21:45] <markstos_> And I suppose it could use parrot in one of two ways. It could emit direct "PIR" code, or it could emit NPQ compatible Perl6 syntax. 

[21:45] <fglock> yes, mp6 worked both ways

[21:45] <fglock> markstos_: kp6 source code is currently 3/4 Perl6, 1/4 Perl5

[21:46] <markstos_> Neat. I'm downloading now to test the performance and compare it vs NQP. 

[21:46] <fglock> it's not meant to be fast

[21:47] <fglock> the priority is correctness

[21:47] <markstos_> Computers will catch up eventually. :)

[21:48] <fglock> the optimizations are 2 phases ahead in the roadmap

[21:48] <markstos_> I saw that. 

[21:49] <markstos_> In a recent P6 design meeting, Patrick talked about starting to use NQP to write more of Perl6-on-Parrot: http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/34132

[21:50] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of chromatic (983)

[21:51] <fglock> we've talked a bit about working out a plan together, but this is yet to happen

[21:51] <markstos_> I was guessing the efforts were separate for now. 

[21:51] <markstos_> My attempt to install v6 0.19 just failed with: "Can't locate Module/CompileV6.pm"

[21:52] <fglock> oops - what's that

[21:54] <markstos_> The ChangeLog says " added: Module::CompileV6", but it is not part of the distribution. 

[21:54] *** fglock_ left

[21:58] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17447 - Pugs - Trac

[22:01] <renormalist> fglock: is v6 on CPAN the same as kp6 or mp6 in pugs?

[22:02] <fglock> v6.pm is perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6/

[22:02] <fglock> it is written mostly in Perl5

[22:03] <markstos_> We could use a README here to explain "you are in the wrong place": http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/v6/v6.pm/

[22:03] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 16464: /v6/v6.pm

[22:04] <fglock> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/v6/README

[22:04] <fglock> it needs an update

[22:04] <markstos_> Ah. :)

[22:05] <markstos_> Ok, once I manually downloaded CompileV6.pm, all the tests passed. 

[22:06] <fglock> markstos_: may I add you as comaintainer?

[22:06] <renormalist> I dont find a Module::CompileV6. 

[22:07] <renormalist> (I just try to install v6 too)

[22:08] <fglock> renormalist: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6/lib/Module/CompileV6.pm

[22:08] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/28gr9o

[22:08] <fglock> it was left out by mistake

[22:09] <markstos_> fglock: you may. The project is interesting to me, but I'm mostly overbooked with my time now. ( I should really be mowing the yard now... ). 

[22:09] <renormalist> and where did markstos_ get it? markstos_ ?

[22:09] <markstos_> I used: wget http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6/lib/Module/CompileV6.pm

[22:09] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/28d5us

[22:09] <markstos_> and then I saved it in the blib/lib directory, and after that, "make test" and "make install" passed. 

[22:10] <markstos_> I tried this for a basic test: "echo 42.say | perl -e 'use v6-alpha'" it worked, but I got three warnings about uninitialized values. 

[22:11] <markstos_> fglock: I believe I'm already a pugs committer, although I don't have an up-to-date tree. 

[22:16] <markstos_> I just compared the performance of "say(42)" with kp6 and NQP.  kp6: 5.6 seconds. NQP: 0.3 seconds... about 15x faster!  However kp6 supports 42.say, but with NQP, I had to use a less sugary syntax: say(42);

[22:17] <fglock> markstos_: if you try it again, it might be faster - v6 uses several cache structures

[22:17] <fglock> markstos_: you can now upload v6 to pause if you'd like

[22:18] *** yahooooo joined
[22:19] <markstos_> Thanks. 

[22:19] <markstos_> flgock: I wasn't faster the second time. But I can try once more. :)

[22:20] <markstos_> Or rather, I should say: that's how fast it ran after some repeated runs. 

[22:20] <renormalist> markstos_: re v6: did you classical perl Makefile.PL, make test, make install or is there something more. My test are all "dubious" ...

[22:20] <markstos_> But as you said, correctness, not performance is the priority, and it worked correctly.

[22:21] <markstos_> renormalist: yes. that's what I did. 

[22:21] <renormalist> what perl version do I need ? is 5.8.8 enough?

[22:21] <markstos_> "dubious" often means "premature" death. 

[22:21] <markstos_> Yes. 

[22:22] <markstos_> Run just one test and see how it fails.  prove -v t/something.t

[22:22] <markstos_> You'll also need the "-b" flag. 

[22:23] *** scw left
[22:24] <renormalist> ah, moment, maybe I am using a wrong perl ...

[23:42] *** franck___ left
[23:47] <renormalist> markstos_: what confuses me again is, you call you example with "use v6-alpha" KindaPerl6. Isn't kp6 the Perl6-in-Perl6 implementation and v6 is (yet another) Perl6-in-Perl5 implementation? See my question to fglock above.
