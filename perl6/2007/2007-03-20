[17:24] <lanny> Ok.  Regaurding 'svk pull' on feather error seems to occur at 15257@.  15256@ says the mirror was relocated to http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs.  Guessing that didn't go smoothly.

[17:24] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 15771: /

[17:27] <geoffb> Nope, the relocated URL is the correct one.  I haven't used feather since the change, so I'm not sure the problem there -- though if you have a local mirror of the repo (rather than using the common one), you should ask the other feather users about redirecting yourself.

[17:29] <lanny> I don't have a local mirror.  Using the SVK instructions found on http://feather.perl6.nl/.

[17:29] <lambdabot> Title: Perl6 Community Development Server

[17:29] <lanny> I see that it's the correct mirror setup.  Wondering if SVN::Mirror needs updating on Feather.  It's a 0.71 and 0.73 is out.

[17:30] <geoffb> Juerd, clkao, or audreyt may be able to help, but I'm out of my weak feather knowledge at this point.

[17:30] *** prly_ joined
[17:32] <lanny> I also tried svk mirroring to my local box with latest svn libs, svk 2.00.  When I try and just sync -s HEAD I get a message about log corruption.  Google provided no joy on a solution.

[17:33] <lanny> Hmm.  I'll compile a local SVN::MIrror and see if that resolves.

[18:32] <lanny> Hmm.  I can successfully mirror and sync -s 15257 so feather svk is definitely having problems with the relocation of the mirror source after 15256@.

[18:33] <[particle]> do you really need all the history?

[18:33] <lanny> Not at all.  But the config comes from ~audreyt/config.

[22:31] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - is audreyt MIA due to hw failures again?

[22:31] <Limbic_Region> I briefly caught something about "perhaps it isn't your harddrive"

[22:32] <allbery_b> I didn't catch the whole ting but she was talkin about corruption in her svk image

[22:32] <integral> backlog to 13:02, she said something about having to change drive again

[22:32] <Limbic_Region> I just caught it in the log

[22:32] <Limbic_Region> she had to switch to Win32

[22:32] <Limbic_Region> so no biggie from my perspective

[22:33] <Limbic_Region> I think Win32 is under appreciated

[22:33] <Limbic_Region> it has been an extremely quiet day apparently

[22:34] <[particle]> everybody's waiting for the parrot release :)

[22:34] <Limbic_Region> oh, who's wearing the hat this month [particle] ?

[22:34] <[particle]> coke

[22:34] <geoffb> The question is: was the pad branch totally local, or did she have a copy somewhere other than ~/.svk?

[22:35] <Limbic_Region> oh yeah, forgot about that geoffb

[22:35] <Limbic_Region> :-(

[22:36] <Limbic_Region> .seen gaal

[22:36] <Limbic_Region> ?seen gaal

[22:36] <lambdabot> gaal is in #perl6 and #haskell. I last heard gaal speak 4h 42m 31s ago.

[22:36] <geoffb> I'm hoping the pad branch delay so far had been about wrapping her brain around the problem, plus other tasks having higher local priority, rather than that there's just a monster amount of code to be wrangled.

[22:37] * Limbic_Region wonders what Data derivations are and why they are useful

[22:38] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - it didn't seem to appear that she was having a hard time recovering the data - only that the disk was going bad

[22:38] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - "update: macbook disk corrupted _again_, this time starting in ~/.svk/. backing up now,...."

[22:38] <geoffb> geoffb: My concern is that she said the corruption *started* there.  Hence, likely to be most likely to have unrecovered bits.

[22:40] <geoffb> I wonder why I addressed myself there ....

[22:41] <lumi> Limbic_Region: They're sort of part of a Haskell type reflection system, I think

[22:44] <allbery_b> Data by itself doesn't make much sense to me

[22:44] <allbery_b> (I wasn't aware of such a thing, nor does ghci appear to be)

[22:45] <Limbic_Region> lumi - yeah, I kinda sorta gathered that from gaal's inquiry to audreyt on the subject.  I was kind of hoping for a lay explanation that told me why they were cool and desireable

[22:46] <lumi> allbery_b: It's part of the Data.Generics thing, isn't it?

[22:46] <allbery_b> Typeable is the reflection thing

[22:46] <allbery_b> ah, there it is, yes

[22:46] <lumi> Limbic_Region: I think it's part of the whole "make Haskell values into Pugs values automagically" jobby

[22:48] <allbery_b> so that makes SYB aka Data.Generics usable, which lets you do all sorts of useful things

[22:48] <Limbic_Region> oh
