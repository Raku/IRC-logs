[06:42] <TimToady> rhr: I get such errors errors occasionally; I think there's some kind of instability in the pugs parser.  usually works when I rerun the same command immediately

[06:46] <TimToady> interestingly, when it fails it's always complaining that one or another of the constant hashes is undefined.

[06:47] <rhr> aha, it's working now!

[06:48] <TimToady> I also don't know why the yaml output isn't nicely formatted at the end for me...

[06:49] <TimToady> and it still doesn't do binding, so all you're getting is positions out, really

[06:50] <TimToady> also kinda agro that it takes my computer a minute of CPU time for pugs to compile the parser... :/

[06:51] <TimToady> kinda slows down the debugging when all you have is print/say...

[06:52] <rhr> yeah, only 7 minutes to parse 42+1 :)

[06:53] <rhr> very impressive though

[06:54] *** JarJarBinks left
[06:56] <TimToady> should parse a lot faster after I do a better job of longest-token extraction.  Also, there are lots of gather/takes that are unneeded under a ratcheting parser

[06:57] <TimToady> but that doesn't help pugs parse the file any faster...

[06:57] <TimToady> hopefully that part can be precompiled at some point

[06:57] <TimToady> once things stabilize

[07:17] *** flokuehn joined
[07:17] <TimToady> eventually, of course, it will need its own set of tests

[12:04] <pmurias> fglock: what's a good way for determining where use v5 ends?

[12:06] <fglock> hmm - 'use v5' is a pugs-ism, I think Perl 6 will use 'eval "...", :lang<perl5>'

[12:06] <pmurias> use v5 is speced in S11

[12:06] <fglock> ah - looking

[12:07] <fglock> there is a token for 'use v5' in the v6.pm grammar - I think you could reuse that

[12:23] <pmurias> does mp6 support .*? 'no v5'

[12:26] <fglock> you can use negative-forward-looking, like:  [ <!before no <?ws> v5 > . ]*

[12:28] <fglock> not sure if mp6 implemented quantifiers, but you can use recursion: token until_no_v5 { [ ... <until_no_v5> ] | '' }

[16:01] <moritz_> and in Hash.pm the iterator accesses self.pairs, but there is no 'has @pairs' or whatever

[16:01] <moritz_> or has $pairs

[16:01] <moritz_> does mp6 support the @ sigil?

[16:01] <fglock> Hash and Array attributes are declared at low level

[16:02] <moritz_> which means that self.pairs actually exists, but is not defined in Hash.pm?

[16:02] <fglock> yes, self.pairs is defined at MOP.pm

[16:03] <fglock> but this can be fixed when we get .map working

[16:06] <fglock> we can get rid of DDS, it is only used for debugging i think

[16:06] <moritz_> somehow lib//KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl6/Pair.pm is included into the perl 5 code

[19:30] <moritz_> javascript is evil all by itself - no "use strict;", no compile time checks, just a huge mess

[19:30] <obra> I thought that newer js actually got a use strict

[19:31] <moritz_> is it supported by $evil_browser, @open_source_browsers, opera?

[20:11] <fglock___> does perl6 @_ contains the invocant, or is it just the positionals, or everything?
