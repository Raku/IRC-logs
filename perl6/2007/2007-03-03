[14:10] <lichtkind> audreyt some things you wish to be recognized about perl6?

[14:10] <lichtkind> or pugs

[14:11] <gaal> unless actually we get them now because the scan is linear on the list?

[14:27] <xerox> gaal: it is described in the user guide. If it's starred your environment is the module's ones own. If not, it works like you have just imported the module.

[18:53] <rindolf> Hi all.

[18:55] <moritz> hi rindolf

[18:56] <rindolf> moritz: what's up?

[18:56] <moritz> rindolf: pugs is running 122 minutes on a smoke test...

[18:57] <rindolf> moritz: I see. :-(

[18:57] <moritz> rindolf: perhaps an endless loop

[18:57] <rindolf> moritz: perhaps.

[18:57] <rindolf> moritz: is it normal? Or does it usually take less time?

[18:57] <moritz> did anybody else make a smoke since r15425

[18:58] <moritz> rindolf: this time I did a "make soon", so it is slower than usually

[18:58] <moritz> rindolf: but it should not be _that_ slow

[18:59] <gaal> make soon is very slow.

[18:59] <gaal> that is, the pugs it produces is.

[19:00] <moritz> gaal: so slow that pugs needs more than 2 hours for a single test file?

[19:00] *** penk joined
[19:00] <gaal> if you have ghc6.6 and enough memory, there's no reason to use it really

[19:00] <gaal> no, that must be looping.

[19:00] <gaal> which file?

[19:00] <moritz> gaal: I don't know

[19:00] <moritz> and now I interrupted it :(

[19:01] <gaal> scrollbuffer?

[19:01] <moritz> gaal: I have 0.5GB, that's litte enough to drive "make" to swap :(

[19:01] <gaal> yeah :(

[19:02] * allbery_b plans to update and smoke later tonight, fwiw

[19:02] <allbery_b> but myt last smoke is from 15376

[19:02] <moritz> gaal: scrollbuffer is not long enough :(, but even that wouldn't help that much since only failing tests produce a output

[19:03] <gaal> moritz: how are you running tests?

[19:03] <moritz> gaal: with "make smoke" from the pugs root dir

[19:03] <gaal> fwiw "make smoke" prints the test file before running it...

[19:04] <moritz> I never saw that

[19:05] *** larsen_ joined
[19:05] <allbery_b> the name of it, not the contents

[19:06] <gaal> yep

[19:08] <moritz> I never noticed that... I'll confirm it when "make" finishes ;)

[19:27] <moritz> ok, you're right ;)

[19:28] <gaal> moritz: make smoke's jsut finished ext/ and entered t/sanity here...

[19:29] <gaal> but I'm a little ill so I'll leave it to run for the night.

[19:29] <gaal> see y'all tomorrow...

[19:30] <moritz> gaal: 'night ;)

[19:30] <rindolf> moritz: I think I'll svn up and make smoke pugs now.

[19:30] <rindolf> Just to help the revolution.

[19:30] <moritz> ;)

[19:31] <moritz> rindolf++ ;)

[19:31] <moritz> rindolf: btw how is your perl dialect coming along?

[19:31] <moritz> rindolf: is it implemented?

[19:31] <rindolf> moritz: nah.

[19:32] <rindolf> moritz: there's a spec at http://www.shlomifish.org/rindolf/ , but that's it.

[19:32] <lambdabot> Title: Rindolf Specification

[19:32] <rindolf> moritz: I realised I wasn't particularly bothered by the things I proposed to actually implement them.

[19:32] <moritz> rindolf: yeah, I skimmed over the first bit

[19:33] <moritz> did you know the Moose modules when you wrote the specs?

[19:33] <rindolf> moritz: I started working on it way before the Moose modules.

[19:42] <moritz> smoke currently works on t/builtins/strings/uc.t

[19:43] <moritz> while r15399 only needs a few seconds

[19:47] *** dduncan joined
[19:48] <moritz> weird, judging from its output the t/builtins/strings/uc.t has finished a few minutes ago, but no new test name is printed

[19:49] <rindolf> moritz: still compiling.

[19:49] <moritz> ok, now it continues - still very weird

[19:54] <rindolf> moritz: finished compilation. Now running make smoke.
