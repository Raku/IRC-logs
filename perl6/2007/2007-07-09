[00:23] * diakopter wonders why svnbot6 has been posting

[00:26] <dduncan> I find pugs_svnbot to be more useful than the old svnbot anyway

[00:27] <dduncan> giving a link to a diff for one thing

[00:29] <Juerd> IMO it should have the link instead of the r123, to save a line. The revision number is in the link anyway, and nobody here is stupid. :)

[00:30] <Juerd> And it'd be nice if lamdabot ignored that url.

[00:30] <dduncan> I like the r123 part as well

[00:31] <dduncan> I don't always want to have to click the link to know what the r# was

[00:31] <dduncan> oh right, its in the link itself

[00:31] <dduncan> not just the link target page

[00:31] <dduncan> nevermind

[00:35] <diakopter> the pugs-based svnbot.pl is *so* resource-intensive

[12:05] <masak> ok
