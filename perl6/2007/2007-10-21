[00:48] <TimToady> that paragraph seems to be confusing some rather unrelated notions...

[00:49] <TimToady> the behavior described has nothing to do with the presence or absence of :ratchet, I think

[00:49] <PerlJam> That would make the most sense to me.  But believing the spec was causing me a headache :)

[09:45] <pmurias> fglock: should add_attribute take a default value for the attribute?

[09:46] <fglock> pmurias: i think so

[09:47] <fglock> it should likely be declared in the accessor signature (?)

[09:47] <fglock> probably not

[09:48] <pmurias> accessor signature == ?

[09:48] <fglock> actually, we need a more complex new() 

[09:48] <pmurias> i got it

[09:49] <fglock> no, i don't think this belongs to the signature

[09:50] <pmurias> fglock: we could pass attribiute descriptors (as defined in S12) to add_attribute

[09:52] <fglock> yes - probably create an Attribute class (like we have one for Method)

[11:05] <fglock> looking

[11:06] <fglock> pmurias - it's my fault, I broke it yesterday - Grammar/Parameter.pm:32

[11:07] <fglock> I'm reworking ::CAPTURIZE(), which creates the named arguments

[11:07] <fglock> at runtime

[11:08] <fglock> the Capture creation depends on the Signature

[11:13] <pmurias> fglock: shouldn't they be represented in the AST instead of sorted out at runtime

[11:13] <pmurias> ?

[11:14] <fglock> we can move ::CAPTURIZE() to compile time, it's an optimization

[11:14] <fglock> it depends on whether you already know the signature
