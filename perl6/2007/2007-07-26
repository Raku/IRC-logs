[00:01] <Eidolos> so let's throw away the last seven years of implementation work and start over? >_>

[00:01] <wolverian> they're not mutually exclusive..

[00:01] <wolverian> perl 6 is a spec, not an implementation

[00:02] <diakopter> Eidolos: again, :P ... there wouldn't be much that's not reusable, actually.

[00:02] <Eidolos> Parrot?

[00:02] <diakopter> the hard work is the find-grained specifying.

[00:02] <diakopter> (of PGE, I'm thinking of)

[00:02] <diakopter> fine-grained

[00:03] * Eidolos shrugs

[00:04] <diakopter> nearly all of pugs would be reusable for #2, but yes, the REPL and unicode stuff could come directly from ghc.

[00:04] <diakopter> and probably other stuff I don't have in the front of my brain at the moment.

[00:06] *** kanru left
[00:13] <diakopter> frankly, I think the bootstrapping step would be nigh impossible anyway, due to Perl 6's (ever-further-pervading) requirements of laziness & parallelism, and the desired-but-as-yet-unspec'ed unified concurrency/event model/api.  So much cross-platform stuff would need to be reimplemented... So many functional compiler optimizations would need to be ported from ghc's bootstrapped haskell compiler source... 

[00:14] <diakopter> based on my *vast* experience writing bootstrapping compilers   LOL  <eye-roll>

[01:13] <Zoffix> diakopter, Regarding that typo in the href="". I never used `svn` before so I don't want to mess anything up. After I edit the files.. what do I do?

[01:17] <Zoffix> Never mind.

[01:18] <diakopter> hm; how about you just nopaste the edits... http://sial.org/pbot/perl6

[01:19] <Zoffix> What's there to nopaste? ....

[01:27] <Zoffix> HTML code needs a major rewrite but I won't be doing it today ;)

[01:32] <Zoffix> Web "Edit Repos" is kinda broken BTW. I would submit the changes but it would say "ERROR: file is identical to the original" even though it isn't. I'd then hit F5 and it would commit :/

[19:15] <dduncan> opinion question: supposedly the identity value of the set intersection operator is a potentially infinite-sized set ... but if you're working in an environment where only finite sets are allowed, what's the best result for a reduce over set intersection?

[19:15] <dduncan> eg, what should [U] return

[19:15] <dduncan> for an empty list

[19:16] <dduncan> or should it just fail() ?

[19:17] <TimToady> maybe it should return *  :)

[19:18] <dduncan> whatever?

[19:18] <TimToady> sounds kinda like the universal set

[19:18] <dduncan> so basically you're saying it should return something, and not die?

[19:19] *** lisppaste3 left
[19:20] <dduncan> that's the main thing I wanted to know, return something special, vs die

[19:23] <TimToady> possibly it should return the Object protoobject

[19:24] <TimToady> $x ~~ Object should always return true, so it is essentially the universal set
