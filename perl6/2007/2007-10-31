[15:59] <pmurias> does #line impose a runtime penaly?

[16:00] <rgs> what, the cpp directive ?

[16:01] <pmurias> in perl5

[16:01] <rgs> nope

[16:01] <pmurias> thought saw, but wasn't certain

[16:01] <rgs> zero penalty at runtime, infinitesimal one at compiletime

[16:02] <rgs> (as in: if you're worried about such penalties, remove all your comments first :)

[16:02] <PerlJam> comments don't exist at run-time  :)

[16:02] <rgs> unless you're MAD

[16:02] <pmurias> rgs: kp6 dosn't emit comments

[16:02] <TimToady> it would be possible for #line to have a runtime effect, but that would also be very small

[16:03] <TimToady> you'd have to be relying on the line number somehow

[16:03] <TimToady> and feed it a large line#

[16:03] <PerlJam> #line 9827398723628728376283746  (perl, please don't barf)

[16:03] <TimToady> for example, if your program took the factorial of the current line number...

[16:05] <pmurias> taking the factorial was the example which also came first to my mind

[16:06] <rgs> and is it a sign of sanity ?

[16:06] <TimToady> is the sign of sanity + or -?

[16:06] <PerlJam> pmurias: rejoice! Your brain is warped into a similar configuration as TimToady's

[16:06] <PerlJam> pmurias: er, I mean ... you poor poor soul  

[16:07] <TimToady> one of us must be redundant... :)

[16:38] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 14468: /pugs

[16:39] <[particle]> svn.perl.org seems like an out-of-date mirror

[16:39] <TimToady> dlocaus: did you feel the earthquake last night?

[16:39] <dlocaus> urhmm... shouldn't "perl.org" be up to date?

[16:39] <dlocaus> oh man...

[16:40] <dlocaus> I was afraid my dog would pee on the bed. :)

[16:40] <[particle]> svn.pugscode.org is the primary repo. i don't know who made the perl.org mirror, or why

[16:40] <TimToady> I figured you did, given your pacbell location

[16:40] <dlocaus>  :)

[16:40] <TimToady> which is very close to my home's

[16:40] *** elmex left
[16:40] <dlocaus> The epicenter is about 2 hours drive south of me.

[16:40] <TimToady> I'm also on snfc21

[16:40] <dlocaus> oh cool!

[16:41] <TimToady> though not as far as irc knows...

[16:41] <TimToady> let's see, that puts you at about Santa Rosa

[16:41] <TimToady> or Dunnigan :)

[16:41] <dlocaus> a little bit south of that... about a cross the bridge. :)

[16:42] <dlocaus> Its nice to know my dog trusts me to fix everything, I just wish she wouldn't let me know during an earth quake.

[16:42] <TimToady> our cats always wanted us to stop the rain

[16:43] <TimToady> I was on top of a stepladder when it hit, so now I've fulfilled one of my life's goals.

[16:44] * Tene fears a pun.

[16:45] <dlocaus> I remember when one of my cats first saw snow.  His eyes just popped wide open.  Of course, I had to throw him into the yard.  I got tired of him testing the snow with his foot.

[16:45] <TimToady> cats always do that in the doorway even when there isn't snow

[16:46] <dlocaus> well, I was out there with him watching it... freezing...

[16:46] <TimToady> anyway, the epicenter was only about 15 miles east of me, so I got a pretty good ride

[16:47] <dlocaus> what were you doing on a step ladder at 8pm?

[16:48] <TimToady> I was about to do a circuit test on the tweeter of the right speaker in my church, which has refrained from tweeting.

[16:49] <TimToady> the speaker, not the church

[16:49] <Tene> So the church tweets?

[16:49] <TimToady> it's an ancient Yamaha speaker that weighs about two tones

[16:49] <TimToady> *tons

[16:49] <dlocaus> uhrmm... I don't know much about electricity, but the earthquake's timing wasn't that great...  ~zap~

[16:50] <TimToady> well, 1 volt is not usually much of a problem

[16:50] <TimToady> funny thing is that I was the guy who put the extra earthquake straps on those speakers 15 years ago

[16:51] <TimToady> 'cause they're right over some of the exits, and I could just imagine them coming down on people panicking and running out...

[16:51] <dlocaus> Test::Harness

[16:51] <TimToady> actually, they only weigh about 119 lb each...

[16:52] <TimToady> but that would still be a bad day for someone

[16:53] <TimToady> anyway, I didn't realize at the time that it could have been a bad day for me.  :)

[16:53] <kolibrie> so the straps held?

[16:53] <dlocaus> I was thinking of the next big one... where the west coast of california was supposed to sink into the sea.

[16:53] <TimToady> yup

[16:54] <[particle]> oh well

[16:55] <TimToady> but given the overall trend here, they're probably a few fractions of an inch further apart now

[16:55] <dlocaus> Calvadarous(sp?)

[16:56] <TimToady> interesting question is now whether the hayward will pop off, given this was right at one end of it

[16:56] <dlocaus> I've got my emergency food & supplies ready for the big one.   I haven't been able to figure out what to do about water though...

[16:57] <dlocaus> The problem mostly is trying to figure out how to get a 55gallon (208 liters) into my house.

[16:57] <dlocaus> 55 gallon drum.

[16:58] <TimToady> water is divisible, y'know...

[16:58] <dlocaus> its the drum that is the problem.

[16:58] *** rindolf left
[16:58] <dlocaus> it won't fit in my car.

[16:58] <dlocaus> and shipping is expensive.

[16:59] *** justatheory left
[16:59] <dlocaus> also... I'm not sure my floor would hold 55 gallon's of water :)

[17:01] <[particle]> how far are you from a water source? filters and pumps are cheap.

[17:01] <dlocaus> that's not a problem, I can run a hose into the house np

[17:01] <dlocaus> or do 1 gallon 2x a day by hand.

[17:02] <dlocaus> its getting the drum and transporting it into my house.

[17:02] * [particle] will be drinking filtered and carried water for the next 3+ weeks

[17:02] <TimToady> what's so sacred about 55 gallons?

[17:02] <dlocaus> no one can steal it.

[17:02] <dlocaus> also, since it's a common container its pretty cheap.

[17:02] <[particle]> they do roll.

[18:41] <dlocaus> I'm not sure that removing $obj->method is a good idea.

[21:04] <dlocaus> Why is there no ::DISPATCH($::Method ... ) to be returned, for your code.  Your code just directly executes the sub routine.

[21:07] *** rindolf joined
[21:07] <dlocaus> and why is there no $meta_Hash, $meta_HashCell, $meta_ArrayCell.

[21:07] <dlocaus> pmurias ...

[21:07] <pmurias> you mean why i pass subs to make_class instead of Methods?

[21:07] <dlocaus> for the $::Hash, $::HashCell, $::ArrayCell

[21:08] <dlocaus> well, no.  I don't understand why we have a $meta_(something)

[21:08] <pmurias> the $meta_(something) is the metaobject for a given class

[21:08] <pmurias> $::(something) is the prototype 

[21:09] <pmurias> object

[21:09] <pmurias> they are diffrent things

[21:10] <pmurias> the $meta_(something) is the thing returned by .HOW()

[21:10] *** iblechbot left
[21:11] <dlocaus> but you are using $meta_(something) to define the object.

[21:11] <dlocaus> my $meta_Role = ::DISPATCH( $::Class, 'new', "Role" );

[21:11] <dlocaus> $::Role = ::DISPATCH( $meta_Role, 'PROTOTYPE' );

[21:12] <pmurias> yes

[21:13] <dlocaus> where is $meta_Role->PROTOTYPE() defined?

[21:13] <pmurias> 850

[21:15] <pmurias> dlocaus: what's the point of the metaclass example?

[21:15] <dlocaus> The documetnation at the bottom?

[21:15] <pmurias> metaobject actually

[21:15] <pmurias> yes

[21:16] <dlocaus> I put it there, so people could get an idea of what the _isa inheriticae looked lik

[21:16] <dlocaus> like

[21:17] <dlocaus> All of the ::DISPATCH() content didn't make a lot of stuff to me, because I couldn't see what was being built.  So I Data::Dumper::Dumper'ed it.

[21:18] <pmurias> i figured it out it was dumped

[21:18] <pmurias> can't people dump it themself if they want to?

[21:19] <dlocaus> Yes.  But why not dump it for them?  They shouldn't have to execute the code to find out what is being produced.

[21:21] <dlocaus> As I read that code... it says that Apply should point to an object $meta_method(?)  that has a dispatched' method of new that returns  the $self->{value}(and then some)

[21:22] <dlocaus>     APPLY=> sub {

[21:22] <dlocaus>             my $self = shift;

[21:22] <dlocaus>             local $::ROUTINE = $self->{_value}{cell};

[21:22] <dlocaus>             $self->{_value}{cell}{_value}{code}->(@_);

[21:22] <dlocaus>         },

[21:22] <dlocaus> your code, just calls it directly.

[21:24] <dlocaus> what happened to the intervening object?

[21:24] <pmurias> dlocaus: could you phrase it diffrently

[21:26] <dlocaus> The original APPLY, is created via a new object created via ::DISPATCH( $::Method, 'new', &sub )

[21:26] <dlocaus> however, your APPLY just directly accesses the &sub.

[21:26] <dlocaus> What happened to the new object that was created via ::DISPATCH( $::Method,'new', &sub )

[21:26] <pmurias> i understand, wait

[21:27] <pmurias> 220 MOP

[21:27] <pmurias> make_class calls ::DISPATCH($::Method,'new',&subroutine) for you
