[14:04] <moritz_> fglock: here on #perl6 it looks like most of your $work is writing compiler/interpreter to do something else for $work 

[14:04] <moritz_> fglock: is that your normal workflow? ;-)

[14:04] <fglock> moritz_: yes :)

[14:05] <moritz_> fglock: sure looks like a cool job ;)

[14:05] <fglock> and I can use Perl 6 for that

[14:06] <moritz_> that's cool

[14:33] <jMCg> Is it a bug or a feature, that one cannot compile pugs?

[14:34] <moritz_> jMCg: I wouldn't call it a feature ;)

[14:34] <moritz_> jMCg: but usually it can be compiled, provided that you have enough RAM and all the prerequiries

[14:38] <fglock> I compiled Pugs a few days ago, on a new computer (installed ghc and such) - no problems here

[14:49] <moritz_> jMCg: could you please do a 'make realclean; perl Makefile.PL; make' and post the full output?

[14:50] <moritz_> jMCg: it could be a missing dependency that isn't caught by Makefile.PL

[14:50] <moritz_> but I'm neither a build nor a haskell expert, so I can't promise to help you ;)

[14:50] <jMCg> moritz_: where's the difference between make distclean and realclean?

[16:49] <pmurias> i'm not sure ;)

[16:50] <pmurias> pugs.make.output suggest you have hidden cabal packages

[16:50] <pmurias>     Could not find module `Data.ByteString.Char8':

[16:50] <pmurias>       it is a member of package bytestring-0.9.0.1, which is hidden

[16:50] <jMCg> pugs.make.out* sounds perverted, I just realized....

[16:51] <pmurias> see http://www.haskell.org/cabal/proposal/index.html

[16:51] <Aankhen``> Making out sounds perverted to you? o_O

[16:52] <jMCg> Aankhen``: making out with pugs does.

[16:52] <Aankhen``> Fair enough.

[17:42] <spinclad> fglock, other kp6camels: i'm doing some rework to [kp6]'s Makefile.PL and script/kp6, to allow a multi-staged bootstrap like gcc's build does.

[17:42] <moritz_> YaY

[17:43] <spinclad> that is, have your previous version in one directory (say, stage0, where we use compiled now), and compile to stage1/;

[17:43] <fglock> spinclad: how does it works?

[17:43] *** polettix joined
[17:44] <fglock> spinclad: cool - have you seen mp6 bootstrap script? (maybe change that too)

[17:44] <spinclad> ... and compile to stage1 (where we compile back to compiled/ now, stepping on our compiler for make -j);

[17:45] *** jdv79 left
[17:45] <fglock> re mp6: v6-MiniPerl6/util/bootstrap-perl5.sh

[17:45] <spinclad> then you could compile from stage1/ to stage2/, and make sure they are identical, before updating changed files in your master copy.

[17:45] *** jdv79 joined
[17:46] <fglock> YaY indeed :)

[17:47] <spinclad> i haven't looked at it yet; changing it similarly sounds a good plan; and likewise for onion/garlick/shallot/whateveritis

[17:47] <moritz_> onion/garlick/shallot sounds like "veg" or "spice" ;)

[17:48] <spinclad> seasoning

[17:48] <spinclad> maybe

[17:48] <moritz_> the compiler named seasoning ;)

[17:49] <spinclad> after all, natural alium knows how to bootstrap itself from season to season...

[17:49] <spinclad> so ours should too

[17:49] *** BooK joined
[17:52] <spinclad> i'm still contemplating how to rework the Makefile so you could just 'make stage1 && make stage2 && make compare && make registerchanges'

[17:54] <spinclad> but i've got changes to script/kp6, giving it a new argument '--stage=stage0',

[17:54] *** drrho left
[17:55] <moritz_> spinclad: when you comit your changes, please /msg or ping me so that I can update the library path for evalbot

[17:55] <spinclad> and a new env var KP6_STAGE=stage1 for Makefile.PL .

[17:56] *** justatheory joined
[17:57] <spinclad> we could still use compiled/ for the master copies, writing them back there, in which case evalbot shouldn't need a change.

[17:58] <spinclad> but i still have to put together some compare and write-back scripting (for the Makefile, eventually).

[17:58] <moritz_> spinclad: but only if kp6 bootstraps itself successfully, right?

[17:59] <spinclad> that would be good practice: 'make stage1 stage2 compare test write-back' or such

[18:00] <spinclad> with a 'make bootstrap' that depends on that sequence maybe.

[18:02] *** jrockway left
[18:02] *** jrockway joined
[18:02] <moritz_> sounds good

[18:02] *** jrockway left
[18:02] *** jrockway_ left
[18:02] <spinclad> so this has been a heads-up and request for comments.  i've been trying it out in a playpen/ directory, and i'll try to make sure the process is working sensibly before checking things in.

[18:02] *** jrockway joined
[18:04] <moritz_> spinclad++

[18:13] <spinclad> ty :)

[18:14] <pmurias> spinclad: stage2+ should be indentical, as the previous version is allowed to give different results then the new current one

[18:16] <pmurias> s/new current/new/

[18:17] <pmurias> or do you mean comparing test results

[18:20] <spinclad> no, the compiled compiler-library files.  stage1 and stage2 might differ, but stage2 and stage3 should be identical (almost always), since stage1,2,3 should all be the new compiler (compiled with previous stages).

[18:21] <spinclad> so i agree, stage2+ should have reached a fixed point, which can then run the test suite as a final check.

[18:24] <pmurias> spinclad: it might be hard to try it out now as kp6 dosn't correctly compile itself

[18:26] *** ludan left
[18:27] *** franck___ left
[18:27] <spinclad> i've tried it out so far with KP6-MP6, which worked (converged, anyway).  haven't tried KP6-KP6 yet; though KP6-MP6 at least compiles its runtime with its kp6.

[18:31] <pmurias> fglock: using ExtractRuleBlock might be used for the delimiters inside code block problem with perl5rx

[18:31] <pmurias> s/using//

[18:32] <fglock> pmurias: yes, it's a possible solution

[18:32] <fglock> I was trying to fix it in the perl5rx emitter

[18:33] <fglock> spinclad: kp6-kp6 doesn't work yet

[18:33] <fglock> but you can leave the solution in place, for when it works

[18:34] <spinclad> i'm hoping this may help kp6-kp6 converge, too
