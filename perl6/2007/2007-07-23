[02:40] <dduncan> opinion question ... I'm thinking now of accelerating my plans to separate my Muldis D language spec (all documentation) and my Muldis DB virtual machine (implements said language) into separate distros ... so that there is then just one official repo for the language spec, which the Perl 5 and Perl 6 and Parrot and whatever Muldis DB can just refer to it externally as Pugs, Parrot, v6.pm, et al refer to the Perl 6 synopsis now ... my c

[02:50] <dduncan> opinion question ... I'm thinking now of accelerating my plans to separate my Muldis D language spec (all documentation) and my Muldis DB virtual machine (implements said language) into separate distros ... so that there is then just one official repo for the language spec, which the Perl 5 and Perl 6 and Parrot and whatever Muldis DB can just refer to it externally as Pugs, Parrot, v6.pm, et al refer to the Perl 6 synopsis now ...

[02:50] <dduncan>  my current question is, perhaps, what alternate namespace to use for the Muldis D language docs, rather than Muldis::DB::Language ... I was thinking perhaps Language::MuldisD, or maybe Muldis::D ...

[02:51] <dduncan> there's also the question of what CPAN category this docs-only distro should go in, eg "Database Interfaces" versus "Language Interfaces" versus "String Language Text Processing" etc ... feedback, asap, is appreciated, particularly concerning what namespace to use, thanks

[02:51] <dduncan> that's all

[02:51] <dduncan> I think that split before the cut-off you saw

[02:51] *** elmex left
[02:52] <spinclad> yes, endings i see are 'now ...', 'Muldis::D ...', 'use, thanks'

[02:53] <dduncan> I guess my IRC client displays to me what I sent, even if others don't get it

[02:53] *** Chris joined
[02:55] *** jisom left
[02:55] <dduncan> I'm about to send the same question to modules@ and another list, but thought I'd ask via fast IRC first

[02:59] <avar> Everything under Muldis:: is probably a nice idea

[02:59] <avar> and Muldis::Doc/Manual/Spec or something

[03:00] <spinclad> as i don't really understand your intent with the terms 'Muldis' and 'D' ('DB' i have an inkling of), i can't say much on the namespace ...

[03:01] <dduncan> 'Muldis' is a word I made up, it means "multiverse of discourse", and intend to brand a whole product line with.

[03:01] <dduncan> Muldis::DB is one product

[03:01] <spinclad> re category, can it be listed in multiple categories?  'DB interface' and 'Language interface'?

[03:01] <dduncan> Muldis D is the name of a programming language; it is a 'D' language according to Darwen and Date

[03:01] <dduncan> technically the language spec transcends an implementation

[03:02] <dduncan> I'm not aware that CPAN lets you pick multiple categories

[03:02] <dduncan> I personally prefer it goes under 'DB Interface', but other 'Language::' modules are under the other

[03:02] *** justatheory joined
[03:03] <dduncan> not that this means the same thing per se ... the 'D' distro is more of a 'synopsis' than an interface implementation

[03:03] <spinclad> personally i see nothing wrong with a 'Language::' module being listed under 'DB interfaces'

[03:03] <dduncan> I don't either

[03:03] <dduncan> so I could request that combination

[05:27] <popt> isn't this channel the place he lurk around?

[05:28] <Alias_> Yes, it is

[05:28] <Alias_> hence 2.

[05:29] <popt> thanks both

[05:29] <revdiablo> Nice to see the datestamp does not include a time zone

[05:29] <Alias_> heh

[05:29] <Alias_> seen Alias_

[05:29] <buubot> Alias_: Seen at Sun Jul 22 22:29:23 2007: <Alias_> heh

[05:29] <Alias_> Well it's not zulu :/

[05:29] <revdiablo> Ah, it's in pacific time

[05:30] <revdiablo> Which makes sense I guess, since buu lives in LA

[05:30] <Alias_> Suddenly the genius of "X hours ago" makes sense

[05:30] <revdiablo> Time is hard (tm)

[05:30] <Alias_> indeed

[05:31] <Alias_> <-- written a bad time library before

[05:31] <Alias_> <-- still struggling to convert it to DateTime in the enormous application

[05:31] <revdiablo> I foolishly try to use epoch times for everything

[05:31] <Alias_> bad bad man

[05:32] <Alias_> I finally managed to evolve past that this year

[05:32] <revdiablo> It's so wonderfully convenient... but yeah.

[05:33] <Alias_> The accumulated suck of epoch time finally reached my breaking point

[05:35] <Alias_> Mostly because I keep having to go back and revisit code 

[05:35] <Alias_> And that's something that smells to high heaven for me

[05:35] <Alias_> So I gave up and let DateTime use whatever CPU cycles it needs to 

[05:36] <revdiablo> For me it's a matter of learning the interface, not resource usage

[05:37] <revdiablo> I really should just do it

[05:37] <Alias_> indeed

[05:37] <Alias_> The key thing to understand DateTime is that you have to really understand that certain things are just not possible

[05:37] *** bsb left
[05:38] <Alias_> And that DateTime would prefer to NOT give you a result, rather than trivialize something that's hard and provide an estimate

[05:38] <Alias_> Which is annoying at first, until you learn to trust that when it won't give you a value that you want, you are probably asking it the wrong question :)

[05:39] <Alias_> So you revisit you question :)

[05:39] <Alias_> your

[05:39] <revdiablo> heh

[05:39] <Alias_> Most of the complaints I see from people are "why don't Datetime give me the number of whatevers between this and that"

[05:40] <Alias_> The answer being of course, "That's a stupid question, and you're a stupid programmer, learn what a 'day' actually means" or something :)

[05:40] <SamB> well, if "whatevers" is months...

[05:40] <revdiablo> So sort of a guard against XY problems

[05:40] <Alias_> SamB: It tends to vary based on the situation :)

[05:40] <SamB> then it's kinda clear why its

[05:40] <SamB> not a good idea

[05:40] <Alias_> Not at first

[05:40] <Alias_> Time is *hard*

[05:41] <SamB> well, months aren't even all the same length

[05:41] <SamB> not even close

[05:41] <_moritz_> it is indeed hard ;)

[05:41] <Alias_> The other annoyance for DateTime is the strict exception model

[05:41] <Alias_> But once you realise how much pain it's saving you, it's worth the extra decoration :)

[05:42] <Alias_> But yeah, it does take a little work to learn the PAI

[17:34] <Limbic_Region> are you talking about the languages/perl6 branch in parrot

[17:35] <diakopter> languages/perl6

[17:35] <Limbic_Region> if the former - already done though I do not know if evalbot would be supported

[17:35] <Limbic_Region> oh, well I have that running on Win32/MinGW and Win32/Cygwin

[17:35] <Limbic_Region> great - connection fubar

[17:36] <diakopter> your messages came through, at least some of them

[17:36] <diakopter> Limbic_Region: it needs to be in its own private chroot

[17:36] <diakopter> imho

[17:37] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - ok, I can only find todo items 1 & 2 

[17:38] <Limbic_Region> and with regards to number 1 - languages/perl6 works out of the box on every platform I have tried so you will need to define what specifically is "todo" about the item

[17:46] <diakopter> Limbic_Region: ok.  you're right; most of #1 will be dependent on how that new evalbot wrapper works (the chroot and such)

[17:46] <Limbic_Region> I suspect though that the perl6 implementation on parrot is not far enough along for evalbot

[18:25] <dduncan> APs?

[18:25] <dduncan> never mind

[18:26] <diakopter> access points

[18:26] <dduncan> thought so

[18:26] <dduncan> but I didn't pick up on that the first time

[18:27] <diakopter> they're all using the same ssid as the official one ("OSCON"), but they provide nonfunctional DHCP servers.

[19:29] <moritz> diakopter: the anchor is not included in the tinyurl-link :(

[19:29] <lambdabot> moritz: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[19:30] <moritz> @massages

[19:30] <lambdabot> diakopter said 1h 47m 6s ago: weird bug where line number anchors in the irc logs don't work in IE6

[19:31] *** lidden joined
[19:31] <Aankhen``> moritz: Probably wouldn't make sense for the anchor to be included, since it has to do redirect 'n' all.

[19:31] <moritz> Aankhen``: aye

[19:32] <moritz> Aankhen``: I'm just hoping that's what's causing the problem, because I have no IE and I'm not very keen on debugging any IE stuff

[19:32] <Aankhen``> Dang, I don't have IE6 installed here.

[19:33] <moritz> there are wors things than not having IE6

[19:33] <moritz> like, for example, having it ;)

[20:39] <dduncan> so how's it taste?

[20:40] <diakopter> dduncan: I dunno yet.  Mr. GHC Himself presenting.  Just began.

[20:40] <diakopter> dduncan: thanks, restarted apache2 and commitbit

[20:41] <[particle]> it'll take hours to find out, even on modern hardware.

[20:41] <dduncan> okay

[23:42] <diakopter> try now

[23:42] <pugs_svnbot> r17126 | Darren_Duncan++ | ext/Muldis-DB/ : the all-Pod Muldis D language spec has been split off to its own repo, is no longer distrib with Muldis DB, nor is in the Pugs distro any longer

[23:42] <diakopter> eh? that's odd

[23:42] <diakopter> unless...... :)

[23:43] <Limbic_Region> also - the journals link on pugscode.org is no longer pointing to planet perl6

[23:43] <Limbic_Region> repo is working again though

[23:44] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[23:44] <Limbic_Region> hrm

[23:44] <Limbic_Region> maybe not

[23:44] <Limbic_Region> it appears to have just hung in mid fetch

[23:45] <Limbic_Region> nevermind, it finished

[23:45] <diakopter> well if you clicked it when apache1.3 was running (instead of apache2), then it might've pointed someplace nonexistent

[23:48] <diakopter> (I disabled apache 1.3 now) :)
