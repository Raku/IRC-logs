[00:00] <rhr> just out of curiosity, could you try http://airen.bcm.umontreal.ca/ghc-pugs-etch/ghc6-doc_6.6.1-2_all.deb ?  It's arch-independent

[00:00] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yt9hu4

[00:00] <Aankhen``> Okay, how?

[00:00] <rhr> it should be the same as yours

[00:01] <rhr> just wget it and dpkg -i

[00:01] <Aankhen``> Wow, I think that worked.

[00:01] <Aankhen``> No errors this time.

[00:01] <Aankhen``> Do I move on to the next step now?

[00:01] <rhr> well, that's certainly confusing

[00:02] <rhr> hold on a sec...

[00:03] <rhr> I wonder if a particular version of haddock has to be installed while ghc is compiled or something

[00:03] <Aankhen``> BRB.

[00:04] <rhr> but both of us should have had the old haddock installed when we compiled it, so maybe not

[00:05] <rhr> I guess you should go ahead for now though

[11:04] <moritz> thoughtpolice: build with 'make'

[11:06] <thoughtpolice> hopefully I can get ghc built on dragonflybsd (there is no ghc porter for dragonfly, so I'm considering doing it) sometime soon so I can move some of that work over and free up some disk space on my obsd box

[11:06] <thoughtpolice> regardless, moritz++ :)

[11:08] <thoughtpolice> oi, first i need a browser that actually *works* and doesn't lock up every five minutes (damn you flock, damn you...) i'm nearly at wits end.

[11:08] <thoughtpolice> links2 anybody?

[11:09] <wolverian> w3m is nice

[11:10] <thoughtpolice> i've heard good things

[11:10] <moritz> there's now browser like wget ;)

[11:10] <thoughtpolice> any win32 support? i am seriously not shy of just using it inside a console on this box

[11:11] <thoughtpolice> it'd probably be more in my style of "sticking it to the graphical man" and doing everything from a cli anyway. plus less memory usage and lock ups. :(

[11:12] <moritz> win32 and cli don't go together very well

[11:12] <thoughtpolice> i just a different cli (Console2)

[11:12] <thoughtpolice> i would use cygwin, but the 'remote install ideology' is so incredibly horrid I just decided to say nay to that.

[11:13] <thoughtpolice> if there were some actual working mirrors, it might be a different story

[11:13] <thoughtpolice> because in my experiance I've gotten cygwin to install once, and that was a long time ago when I probably was barely in high school

[14:19] <Juerd> I must admit that I understand little about the complaint.

[14:19] <Juerd> My gut feeling is that if a server can't handle an anonymously-public operation done once every few minutes, the box is in desparate need of an upgrade, or the feature should be disabled.

[14:22] <diakopter> yes; someone's resources must be feeling a pinch, imho.

[14:22] <Juerd> In any case, apparently someone at svn.perl.org does think there's a problem

[14:45] * diakopter imagines ironport switches and cisco routers superglued to each other and to the inside walls of a rack.

[14:45] <Juerd> Hm. We don't use actual glue in racks

[14:45] <Juerd> Tie wraps and duct tapes, sure, but no glue.

[14:46] <Juerd> Everything goes through this ancient Cisco switch, though. I'm convinced its PCB is glued together.

[20:21] <moritz> yes

[20:46] <moritz> fglock_: if you add Prelude.pm to Makefile, it is easier to figure out how to compile it ;)

[20:47] <fglock> moritz: I've got to understand the Makefile first :)

[21:03] <moritz> what's class "Signature" for?

[21:05] <moritz> fglock: then I'd expect it to be a list of type specs

[21:05] <moritz> fglock: can you elaborate a bit on why you did it this way?

[21:06] <fglock> moritz: that's the 'array' part; the 'hash' part is keyed by parameter name

[21:07] <moritz> and what's $.scalar?

[21:07] <fglock> could also be called 'invocant', 'positionals' and 'named'

[21:07] <fglock> probably should

[21:09] <moritz> anyway, time for bed ;)

[21:09] <diakopter> is the return type part of the signature, for casting or "context"?

[21:09] <fglock> moritz: good night

[21:09] <diakopter> (wantarray, want******, etc)

[21:10] <fglock> diakopter: not sure, i've got to check that

[21:10] <fglock> but i think that the return type is not part of the signature

[21:12] <diakopter> oh. :/  seems to me it should be?

[21:12] <spinclad> re svnbot: i was liking the header++ | branchname: style, myself...

[21:13] <diakopter> spinclad: msg/email Juerd about it :P

[21:13] <fglock> brb

[21:13] <spinclad> what, it makes a difference in polling svn.perl.org?

[21:14] <diakopter> no

[21:15] <diakopter> It just wasn't I who changed it back (to 'false true'), so I assumed it was Juerd.

[21:15] *** TJCRI left
[21:18] <spinclad> could have been an accidental reversion then maybe.  if everyline++ has actual supporters, i'll be happy with it; if not, i've made my noise now for the other.

[21:20] <spinclad> i'll /msg him and ask.  thanks.

[21:45] <Juerd> 5 pages on how whitespace and comments work

[21:48] <Juerd> I haven't read the rest yet.

[21:48] <Juerd> As I said: "first impression" :)

[21:49] <PerlJam> Juerd: Are you going to read through the other synopses as well?

[21:50] <Juerd> The unspace seems necessary (though if someone can come up with a better idea, please do so :P), but the inline comments are annoyingly complicated, and I expect: error prone.

[21:50] <Juerd> PerlJam: Not sure.

[21:50] <Juerd> Reading this makes me want to talk about the things I don't like

[21:50] <Juerd> And my hands and wrists hurt.

[21:51] <PerlJam> Juerd: You seem to have a critical eye, so I'd be interested to read your impressions if you ever care to write them down.

[21:51] *** weinig_ left
[21:51] <PerlJam> (The whitespace rules make me ... uncomfortable, let's say, but I've come to accept them)

[21:51] <Tene> PerlJam: howso?  I rather like them.

[21:51] <Juerd> In general, my complaints will be in the form "<foo> is incredibly complex", with arguments like "it's hard to learn" or "it's too easy to make subtle mistakes with huge consequences" :)

[21:52] <Juerd> PerlJam: I was aware of the existence of both features. But now that I see the implications/consequences, I'm un-accepting them :)

[21:52] <Khisanth> Juerd: typic description of Perl? :)

[21:52] <Juerd> Khisanth: No.

[21:52] <Juerd> Khisanth: I love Perl, and I love Perl 6

[21:53] <buu> "But ours is a forbidden love.."

[21:53] <spinclad> "hard to learn" and "fragile" are both important feedback

[21:53] <Juerd> But I think its complexity is wildly growing out of proportion.

[21:53] <Khisanth> buu: depends on what country you are in

[21:53] <PerlJam> Tene: I'll let you know in detail about my comfort with them as soon as I try to write something that explains it to a newbie :)

[21:53] <Juerd> (s/is growing/has been growing/)

[21:54] <buu> Juerd: I'm going to guess we hit that stage 5 years ago..

[21:55] <Juerd> Full unicode support in the syntax is going to be expensive when parsing.

[21:55] <Juerd> Should probably be configurable, so that you can easily opt for a much less extended set of supported brackets.

[21:56] <PerlJam> Juerd: growing out of proportion compared to what?

[21:57] <Juerd> PerlJam: User clue.

[21:58] <Juerd> Syntax is the basis of a language. At least *syntax* should be understandable by the majority of programmers.

[21:58] <Juerd> You can then add as many classes and methods as you like -- you can easily look those up in documentation.

[21:59] <Juerd> (in *structured* documentation, I might add)

[21:59] <Juerd> But every single Perl programmer needs to know that a bracketing character following # makes the # very, very special.

[21:59] *** thestarslookdown joined
[22:00] <PerlJam> I believe that merlyn and bdf are writing "Learning Perl 6".  If they can explain it to ordinary folk, then it's probably okay.

[22:00] <Juerd> It would be less annoying if inline comments didn't ride on #.

[22:00] <Tene> howso?

[22:01] <Juerd> # introduces a line-end comment

[22:01] <Juerd> Unless it is followed by a opening bracket

[22:01] <Juerd> Unless the # is at the beginning of a line

[22:04] <Juerd>     or it is followed by an opening bracket, and NOT at the beginning of a line -- then it's an embedded comment

[22:04] <Juerd> (unless+or makes me equally nervous :P)
