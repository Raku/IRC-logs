[00:43] <Aankhen``> Man, SVN is bloody crazy.

[00:43] <Aankhen``> I `svn up` a file, and it's all fine.

[00:43] <Aankhen``> I make one change to it, and suddenly when I view the diff, it's doing a diff against some ancient version.

[00:44] <Aankhen``> (No updates in the meantime or anything.)

[00:46] <Tene> Well *obviously* you should use $other instead!

[00:46] <svnbot6> r16261 | Aankhen++ | util/smartlinks.pl:

[00:46] <svnbot6> r16261 | Aankhen++ | * added skip links for non-JS users.

[00:47] <Aankhen``> Tene: Hmph.

[00:50] <Aankhen``> Ah, it was some weird problem with .svn being out-of-sync or something like that.

[00:55] <svnbot6> r16262 | Aankhen++ | util/t/01-smartlinks.t:

[00:55] <svnbot6> r16262 | Aankhen++ | * updated &fix_randomness for the updated classnames.

[01:58] <dduncan> I have a style question: in practice, do people usually write their SQL keywords all in uppercase, all in lowercase, or a mixture thereof?

[01:59] <dduncan> Most examples I see are all uppercase, but does anyone actively prefer alternatives?

[02:00] <dduncan> oops, wrong channel

[03:54] <Aankhen``> Hmm, guess not.

[03:55] <agentzh> it's failing on your side?

[03:55] <Aankhen``> No, I was wondering about the cleanup.

[03:56] <Aankhen``> Not going to add, just fiddle with the HTML a bit.

[06:08] <agentzh> moritz: line anchor support has landed. i'll commit it as soon as feather is back.

[06:09] <Aankhen``> Heh, I'll finally understand what it means. :-P

[06:09] <agentzh> line anchors?

[06:09] <Aankhen``> Yeah.

[06:09] <Aankhen``> Do you mean linking stuff like S02:273 to the exact line?

[06:09] <agentzh> right.

[06:10] <Aankhen``> Ahh.

[06:10] <Aankhen``> That wasn't so hard.

[06:10] <Aankhen``> I wonder why it made my head explode earlier.

[06:10] <agentzh> we are talking about http://.../S04.html#_line_117

[06:10] <Aankhen``> Right.

[06:10] <Aankhen``> Ah, would be useful to have XHTML 2's `l` element there.

[06:10] <agentzh> what's that?

[06:11] <Aankhen``> You could think of it as a more useful translation of the `br` element.  It's intended for marking up individual lines.

[06:11] <Aankhen``> <l>Line 1</l><l>Line 2</l> # among other things, they'd have a linebreak in between.

[06:12] <agentzh> ah

[06:12] <agentzh> how to jump to a particular line then?

[06:14] <Aankhen``> Oh, you'd give all the `l` elements themselves IDs.

[06:14] <Aankhen``> <l id="_line_1">...</l><l id="_line_2">...</l>

[06:14] <agentzh> okay

[06:15] <Aankhen``> What are you placing the anchors on, BTW?

[06:15] <agentzh> currently i'm using <a name="_line_1"></a> <a name="_line_2"></a>

[06:15] *** kunwon1 joined
[06:15] <Aankhen``> Mmm.

[06:16] <agentzh> it works at least :)

[06:16] <Aankhen``> Well, it would probably be better semantics, if you feel like doing it, to make it <span id="_line_1">...</span> and so on.

[06:16] <Aankhen``> Oh, sure, getting it to work is the most important part. ;-)

[06:16] <Aankhen``> I'm just very big on "refining" other people's work and not really doing much on my own. :-P

[06:17] <agentzh> hopefully you'll refine the line anchor stuff after i commit it.

[06:17] <agentzh> use of <span> looks tricky to implement since it wraps things.

[06:19] <agentzh> i tried very hard to ensure those anchors didn't affect the appearance.

[06:23] <Aankhen``> I'll take a whack at it.

[06:24] * agentzh summons feather.

[06:24] <Aankhen``> Go agentzh! ^_^

[06:25] <agentzh> weird. apache is down? ssh works, ping works, but http doesn't :(

[06:40] <Aankhen``> I was just thinking about it, and I suddenly realized that if I had to choose the one most important thing Perl 6 brings to the table, it wouldn't be any syntactic feature or programming style or anything of the sort.  Rather, it would be the sense of opening up the language.

[06:42] <agentzh> totally agree. just consider other languages like C# and Java...

[06:43] <Aankhen``> Absolutely.

[06:43] <Aankhen``> But even more "flexible" and "dynamic" languages, like Python, Ruby or *shudders* PHP‚Ä¶ they've got nothing on Perl 6.

[06:44] <Aankhen``> I suppose Perl 6 will have nothing on Lisp. *giggles*

[06:55] <QtPlatypus> Aankhen``: I secretly suspect that Perl6 is a lisp.

[06:56] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[07:02] <agentzh> i restarted apache on feather.

[07:02] <Aankhen``> Kewlies.

[07:02] <agentzh> httpd was not running.

[07:02] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[07:02] <Aankhen``> I wonder how come?

[07:02] <agentzh> not sure if it's intentional or not.

[07:03] <agentzh> maybe our admin brought it down for maintainance?

[07:03] * Aankhen`` shrugs.

[07:29] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[07:30] <agentzh> Aankhen``: absolutely

[07:33] <agentzh> the anchors' names shouldn't be lead by underscores?

[07:34] <agentzh> it jumps twice, hmm

[07:35] <agentzh> odd...

[07:37] <agentzh> it works fine in IE, but firefox tends to take another jump away from the right position...

[07:42] <agentzh> The "Go" button of firefox works while the refresh button does not :(

[07:42] <dduncan> regarding those line-specific anchors, I suspect it may be more maintainable if they count lines relative to (following) a particular section heading ... that way, as the Synopsis continue to be edited, the links are less likely to break horribly

[07:43] <dduncan> at least assuming the current numbers are absolute for the file

[07:43] <agentzh> dduncan: but TimToady tends to get line numbers from his vim.

[07:44] <agentzh> dduncan: it's mainly for linking from "S04:123" in irc logs rather than from the test suite via smartlinks.

[07:44] <dduncan> okay

[07:44] <agentzh> :)

[07:44] <dduncan> in that case, since they are just used for short periods, that should work well

[10:06] <Juerd> Trac will be re-enabled when feather's performance problem is solved, indeed

[10:07] <Juerd> A linux expert friend is going to look at it tomorrow. I hope he'll find something that can be improved

[10:09] <moritz> I think you should forbid most of trac's pages for robots

[10:09] <Juerd> Depends on how well or bad performance gets

[10:10] <Juerd> I disabled trac because it easily spent a few minutes per request

[10:10] <Juerd> And no browser would still be connected to the server at the point where it started outputting

[10:11] * Juerd hasn't considered for a second to profile and/or optimize trac

[10:12] <Juerd> Python...

[10:13] <moritz> if most web app were written in perl the world would be a better place

[10:13] <moritz> at least the internet, that is ;)

[10:14] <integral> The problem is something deeper than feather just being very heavily loaded with pugs and svk processes?

[11:41] *** ofer joined
[11:53] <moritz> I think the problem is that the test sections are visible by default

[11:54] <moritz> It should be fixed by setting them to display:none by default

[11:55] <agentzh> moritz: no, "display:none" only makes the deviation much smaller, but still inexact. :(

[11:55] <agentzh> i've already tried that.

[11:55] <moritz> but less error is better than more error

[11:55] <agentzh> disabling javascript completely "fixes" it.

[11:55] <agentzh> moritz: i'm looking for a true fix.

[11:56] <moritz> agentzh: fix the browsers *SCNR*

[11:57] <agentzh> i think we should do some kind of repositioning at the end of load-time js handler.

[11:57] <agentzh> not sure if location.hash='#_line_XX' is a solution.

[11:58] <agentzh> it loops, it seems.

[11:58] <moritz> whats .hash?

[12:54] <agentzh> in iceweasel only?

[12:54] <moritz> agentzh: but when I hit enter again in the URL bar, it works

[12:54] <moritz> in konqueror it works without problems

[12:55] <agentzh> gotcha.

[12:55] <agentzh> google doesn't give me any clue regarding iceweasel's oddity...

[12:56] <moritz> agentzh: you know that iceweasel is nearly firefox?

[12:56] <moritz> it's just rebranded + debian patches

[12:56] <agentzh> moritz: yes, i'm aware of.

[12:56] <agentzh> that

[12:56] <agentzh> my win32 port of firefox works fine.

[12:57] <moritz> and links from other pages work as well

[12:57] <moritz> so it's just an oddity that you can safely ignore ;)

[12:57] <agentzh> i'd make some small changes to see if the problem can go away.

[13:06] <svnbot6> r16278 | agentz++ | hopefully this is why iceweasel gives up repositioning.

[13:38] <agentzh> yup

[13:38] <moritz> so it should be viewed as a rough estimate rather than an exact pointer

[13:38] <agentzh> aye

[19:41] <Juerd> wolverian: No progress

[19:41] <Juerd> wolverian: How? I've tried vmstat, but that looks normal

[19:43] <wolverian> so you know what it should look like? hm. no idea then.

[19:43] <wolverian> (the problem with vmstat is that you need a reference figure to compare against)

[19:50] <wolverian> Juerd, have you looked for rootkits? :/

[19:50] <Juerd> wolverian: Hm.

[19:50] <Juerd> No.

[19:51] <Juerd> Hadn't even thought of it

[19:51] <Juerd> But it's of course very much possible, with so many local users

[19:51] <Juerd> My god, chkrootkit is slow )

[19:51] <Juerd> :)

[19:51] <wolverian> a good rootkit wouldn't even show up in top

[19:51] <wolverian> heh

[19:51] <Juerd> I know. I didn't think of it this time because I kind of trust these dozens of people I never met before, better than I trust my own clients.

[19:52] <wolverian> well, it could have been a service hole too.. though I trust debian as well.

[19:52] <wolverian> (but not blindly)

[19:52] <Juerd> chkrootkit found nothing

[19:54] <wolverian> hm.

[19:55] <wolverian> Juerd, is the load high even if you kill the various bots and services?

[19:56] <Juerd> Yes, as soon as it starts doing something substantial

[19:56] <Juerd> Like a backup, distupgrade, heavy CGI thing like jifty

[19:56] <Juerd> compiling, loading irssi (but when loaded, it's fine)

[19:57] <wolverian> have you looked at top with threads enabled?

[19:57] <wolverian> (press H)

[19:57] <wolverian> that is a lot of pugs threads..

[19:57] <Juerd> Doesn't reveal anything special in my view

[19:57] <Juerd> Sure, but the pugs things aren't very active

[19:58] <Juerd> A machine that's mostly 80% idle shouldn't have a load of 5

[19:58] <Juerd> I/O is mostly idle too

[19:58] <wolverian> when I look at it, pugs jumps to the top every five seconds or so

[19:59] <Juerd> Yes, but that's not all day

[19:59] <Juerd> And still with 100% cpu, I don't expect such a high load

[19:59] <wolverian> ah, okay.

[20:14] <wolverian> I wonder if dstat would help

[20:20] <wolverian> that's true. sorry.

[20:20] <wolverian> I was just thinking of graphs there

[20:29] * Juerd has no idea how to read these values

[20:29] <wolverian> my desktop has 1452 

[20:29] * wolverian neither

[20:30] <Juerd> I like dstat though

[20:31] <Juerd> It's a nicer tool than vmstat and iostat

[20:31] <wolverian> yes

[20:31] <wolverian> it doesn't show anything suspicious here though

[20:31] <wolverian> I wish this was solaris 

[20:31] <Juerd> I have ~850 csw on my laptop

[20:31] <wolverian> it has proper io accounting 

[20:32] <Juerd> That by itself isn't a good reason to run solaris

[20:32] <Juerd> I don't think solaris would make a great platform for feather :)

[20:32] <wolverian> right, but I wish linux had its iostat :)

[20:33] <wolverian> I can't think of anything else 

[20:34] <wolverian> either it's a rootkit or it's processes waiting for io

[20:34] <wolverian> since the cpu is idle

[20:34] <Juerd> Nothing is actually doing any significant io though

[20:34] <wolverian> I want to ask "how much time is spent waiting for the spindles to move"

[20:34] <wolverian> unsurprisingly I can't ask that in linux

[20:35] <wolverian> that's a bit pessimistic

[20:35] <wolverian> the io stats just suck.

[20:36] <wolverian> hm, the uptime is now down to 0.2

[20:36] <wolverian> er..  load

[20:37] <wolverian> aaand now it's back to over 1. oh well.

[20:37] <wolverian> a load of pugses lifted it again :)

[20:37] <wolverian> (a plural of a plural there)

[20:37] <wolverian> and I guess I should have said s,load,pack,

[20:40] <PerlJam> Why the microscopic attention to the load average?

[20:40] <wolverian> because it's so high even when the machine is supposedly idle

[20:40] <wolverian> I guess one could use sa(8) to look at total accounting information

[20:41] <PerlJam> Even a mostly idle machine can have periodic fluxes in load average.

[20:42] <PerlJam> load average is sort of like blood pressure.  It's only a problem if it's persistently high.

[20:42] <wolverian> I understand that's exactly why we're looking into it. because it's persistently high.

[20:42] <wolverian> unfortunately I'm not very good at it, so please help if you know how :)

[20:42] <PerlJam> clearly not if it drops and then goes back up.  

[20:43] <PerlJam> up and down is normal.  up and up and up is bad.

[20:43] <wolverian> well, ask Juerd. maybe he did something that fixed it now. :)

[20:43] <Juerd> PerlJam: Because it's constantly much higher than I'd expect, and many people complain about performance.

[20:44] <Juerd> PerlJam: In fact, it's now under 1, for the first time in a week I guess

[20:44] <wolverian> yeah.

[20:44] <Juerd> I've slayed agentzh, who had a pugs compile running unniced, while not being logged in.

[20:44] <Juerd> But I can't imagine that was the problem, a single compile

[20:44] <Juerd> And load's at 4.77 again now.

[20:44] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[20:45] <wolverian> all I see in top are andara's and audrey's pugs

[20:45] <wolverian> I don't know how to read the thread information, but a screenful of them all at 99% looks scary :)

[20:45] <PerlJam> top is a very blunt tool for diagnosing load problems.

[20:45] <PerlJam> (unfortunately I don't know of a finer tool right off)

[20:45] <Juerd> Yes.

[20:46] <PerlJam> I wonder what pugs does while idling?

[20:46] <PerlJam> Perhaps there are some Haskell-related GC going on periodically.

[20:47] <Juerd> PerlJam: Whoa, numerous ALRMs apparently

[20:47] <wolverian> ow.

[20:47] <PerlJam> strange

[20:47] <Juerd> Yep, constant ALRM and INTs

[20:47] <Juerd> For every idle pugs process

[20:48] <Juerd> igreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])

[20:48] <Juerd> futex(0x8946660, FUTEX_WAIT, 33503, NULL) = -1 EINTR (Interrupted system call)

[20:48] <Juerd> --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) ---

[20:48] <Juerd> repeated

[20:48] <Juerd> I don't know which one comes first.

[20:49] <PerlJam> the trick is figuring out if those are endemic to long-running ghc processes or just pugs

[20:50] <Juerd> What is endemic?

[20:50] <Juerd> Hm, things are fast now

[20:50] <wolverian> e.g. an endemic disease; related to a specific people or locale

[20:50] <Juerd> So it may indeed have been agentzh's processes

[20:50] <wolverian> or process ;)

[20:50] <PerlJam> um ... endemic is like characteristic

[20:51] <wolverian> how about andara's and audrey's?

[20:51] <wolverian> do they behave similarly?

[20:51] <Juerd> Yes

[20:51] *** lichtkind joined
[20:51] <Juerd> Though they do different things while the signals come in

[20:52] <Juerd> andara's pugses do ioctl()s, audrey's do futex()s

[20:52] <Juerd> But both get a constant flood of ALRMs

[20:52] <Juerd> That's a lot of signals.

[20:53] <wolverian> ghci does the same thing

[20:53] <Juerd> I don't know if it's bad

[20:53] <PerlJam> it may not be bad per se, but it might be bad for feather

[20:53] <Juerd> At some level I think an OS should just deal with it.

[20:54] <wolverian> well, perl -d0 doesn't do it ;)

[20:55] <Juerd> That waits for user input

[20:55] <wolverian> so does ghci

[20:55] <Juerd> So it probably select()s

[20:55] <PerlJam> hmm. ghc may have a poor IO model

[21:00] <Juerd> Heh, would this still be the old 18.2 thing?

[21:00] <wolverian> 18.2?

[21:00] <Juerd> Yeah, something about 18.2 ticks in a cpu second

[21:00] <Juerd> When I still coded in BASIC, this was a big thing, because it meant the finest granularity in sleeps was 55 ms

[21:00] <Juerd> ?eval 1/18.2

[21:01] <evalbot_r16281> 5/91

[21:01] <wolverian> yes, that's the basic timer granurality

[21:01] <Juerd> Sigh

[21:01] <wolverian> ..granularity

[21:01] <Juerd> It can't be a coincidence that these pugs processes get approx 18 sigalrms per second, right? :)

[21:01] <Juerd> That's as fast as it gets probably

[21:01] <PerlJam> It's probably trying to generate more than 18/sec but that's all that can be processed.

[21:01] <PerlJam> right.  Not a coincidence

[21:01] <Juerd> That sounds like a very, very tight event loop...

[21:02] <wolverian> event loops are supposed to wait for io...

[21:02] <wolverian> surely..? :)

[21:02] <PerlJam> Tell audrey and I'm sure she'll know exactly what to change to make it better ;-)

[21:04] <Juerd> audreyt: ping

[21:04] <Juerd> I wonder if she'll pong

[21:04] * PerlJam wanders off to prepare for a 3 hour journey

[21:04] <lichtkind> moritz wollt halt eigentlich nur sagen das ich mein tutorial leicht umarbeiten will das es nicht unbedingt perl5 vorausgestzt wird aber es wird halt kein kurs programmieren lernen mit perl6 sondern schon eher ein komprimiertes lernen

[21:04] <audreyt> it's the GHC microkernel

[21:04] <audreyt> it has its own scheduler

[21:04] <audreyt> which is preemptive

[21:04] <audreyt> the ALRM signals are entirely normal

[21:05] <Juerd> audreyt: Could they be the source of feather's bad performance?

[21:06] <Juerd> I don't know what signals do to a system

[21:06] <mugwump> ?eval 4.772727 / 65536 / 4

[21:06] <evalbot_r16281> 4772727/262144000000

[21:06] <wolverian> haha.

[21:06] <lichtkind> audreyt++ for her last talk

[21:06] <Juerd> But I can imagine that a dozen pugses all doing 18 signals per second, might have some effect

[21:06] <mugwump> ?eval 4772727 / 65536 / 4

[21:06] <evalbot_r16281> 4772727/262144

[21:06] <mugwump> ?eval (4772727 / 65536 / 4)+0.0

[21:07] <evalbot_r16281> 4772727/262144

[21:07] <audreyt> Juerd: all GHC applications do that... I think it's fine, in particlar on linux. in Israel we suspected the same thing but avar(?)'s debugging showed it's false alarm

[21:07] <Juerd> Okay

[21:07] <Juerd> Nice pun btw :)

[21:08] <audreyt> entirely unintentional

[21:08] <Juerd> Still nice :)

[21:09] <Juerd> And it's nice to see you're still here; I'm not active much, but see you much less than before when I am. How are you?

[21:09] <audreyt> been hacking away at the local branch before talking about it :)

[21:09] <Juerd> And how are you personally? :)

[21:10] <audreyt> before today it was 8543 test cases 6500ish ok

[21:10] <audreyt> 5 minutes ago it was 11436 test cases: 10006 ok, 1430 failed, 1024 todo, 770 skipped and 23 unexpectedly succeeded

[21:10] <moritz> lichtkind: ich hab halt drei verschiedene Tutorials, unterschiedliche Zilgruppen haben...

[21:10] <audreyt> still, the smoke clusters has it at 18603 test cases: 18085 ok

[21:10] <audreyt> so still some ways to go before I can commitback

[21:10] <offby1> ave

[21:10] <audreyt> (it's the pads+MO branch)

[21:10] <wolverian> shiny. 

[21:10] <Juerd> Did you hack all day between before-today and 5 minutes ago? :)

[21:11] <moritz> lichtkind: und ehrlich gesagt mir gef√§llt das layout des wikis √ºberhaupt nicht, deshalb habe ich keine gro√üe Lust, darin mitzuhelfen... ein paar fixes vielleicht, aber kein gro√üen neuen content ;)

[21:11] <audreyt> Juerd: something close to it yes.

[21:11] <lichtkind> moritz:  seh ich grad was ich nicht unbedingt ideal halte aber vielleicht kann ich dir trotzdmem bei der seite helfen

[21:11] <Juerd> audreyt++

[21:11] <audreyt> and the night before, actually

[21:11] <moritz> lichtkind: hilfe ist immer wilkommen... wenn du willst geb ich dir zugang zum svn

[21:11] <lichtkind> moritz:  wir k√∂nnen sie ja auch bei dir reinstellen

[21:11] <audreyt> it's good that smoke tests doesn't lie ;) because it forced several rewrites ;)

[21:12] <Juerd> lichtkind, moritz: Could you please use a query or speak English here?

[21:12] <moritz> Juerd: sorry, yes

[21:12] <moritz> lichtkind: are you in #perlde on irc.perl.org?

[21:12] * Juerd stupidly wrote that sentence in German first...

[21:12] <lichtkind> moritz:  no

[21:13] <lichtkind> Moritz i first finish second part of my perl6 article for foo magazine

[21:13] <moritz> lichtkind: I'd like to discuss it at some other time anyway, perhaps I'll send you a mail, or ping you sometimes next week

[21:13] * Juerd himself is bad at context switching, specifically between languages

[21:13] <moritz> ok, so no need for hurry

[21:13] <lichtkind> k

[21:17] <Juerd> I killed 10 or so idle pugses

[21:18] <Juerd> And although I like to believe that the sigalrms don't do much, it did make performance better

[21:19] <audreyt> pugs's own event loop may be cpu consuming a lot.

[21:19] <audreyt> if it's stuck in some while loop or so

[21:19] <Aankhen``> Okay, first draft of Perl6::Perldoc::To::Html is done. :-D Now to begin the debugging cycle.

[21:19] <lambdabot> Aankhen``: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[21:20] <Aankhen``> @messages

[21:20] <lambdabot> agentzh said 9h 5s ago: i just don't understand why the window load event handler runs so many times while loading.

[21:20] <Juerd> audreyt: it's not cpu or io, at least not measurable by the usual tools (top, iostat)

[21:20] <Aankhen``> @tell agentzh That's strange, the `load` handler should only be running once.

[21:20] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[21:20] <wolverian> Aankhen``, what's wrong with To::Xhtml? :)

[21:20] <audreyt> nod. ok then.

[21:21] <Aankhen``> wolverian: It's XHTML. :-)

[21:21] <Juerd> audreyt: I've re-enabled trac

[21:21] <audreyt> k

[21:21] <wolverian> Aankhen``, ...that's bad? ;)

[21:21] <Aankhen``> wolverian: In this context, it's pointless.

[21:21] <Juerd> audreyt: Let's see how this goes. Currently it returns pages within a few seconds. That's better than a few minutes, at which it was before

[21:21] <wolverian> Aankhen``, hm. why?

[21:21] <Aankhen``> wolverian: XHTML = 0 benefits, larger code size, and treated as tag soup by the browser since it's being sent as text/html.

[21:22] <wolverian> Aankhen``, oh. holy war, then. :)

[21:22] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[21:22] <Juerd> XHTML is useful only if you're combining it with other XML stuff.

[21:22] <Juerd> Like SVG

[21:22] <Juerd> Or XSL

[21:22] <wolverian> or mathml.

[21:22] <Juerd> Right

[21:22] <Aankhen``> Well, ::To::Xhtml is fine, but to satisfy myself I'm writing ::To::Html.

[21:23] <Aankhen``> Aye.

[21:23] <Juerd> But it's utterly useless just as an html replacement.

[21:23] <Aankhen``> Yup.

[21:23] <Juerd> In fact, it's downright annoying to me.

[21:23] <Aankhen``> Same here.

[21:23] <Aankhen``> Hence ::To::Html

[21:23] <lichtkind> moritz:  maybe i start with some blog posts there

[21:23] <Aankhen``> Okay, shower time.

[21:23] * Aankhen`` wanders off.

[21:23] <wolverian> I have high hopes for xhtml2, which is remarkably sane, but it goes the way of xhtml1 because IE won't implement it. oh well.

[21:23] <Juerd> I write my html by hand, and don't like to use a gazillion quotes where they were previously unneeded

[21:23] <Juerd> Quotes around integers feel wrong anyway.

[21:24] <Juerd> wolverian: Let's first have hope for xml2

[21:24] <Juerd> Because xml is the greatest downside of xhtml.

[21:24] <avar> xhtml is not pointless, you can parse it with xml parsers which are a dime a dozen, instead of a much more complex sgml parser

[21:24] <Juerd> Many of its issues are irrepairable because it depends on xml1

[21:24] <Juerd> avar: I implied that

[21:25] <wolverian> what's wrong with xml1?

[21:25] <Juerd> avar: But the sgml parser already exists, and there's no noticeable difference in speed for the user.

[21:25] <Juerd> wolverian: Syntax.

[21:25] <Juerd> wolverian: Mostly, to me personally, quotes and closing tags.

[21:25] <wolverian> Juerd, yeah. vim's xhtml mode helps _a lot_. :)

[21:25] <wolverian> and running the file through gnu tidy ;)

[21:26] <wolverian> (xhtml mode ne html mode)

[21:26] <wolverian> (ne xml mode)

[21:26] <Juerd> wolverian: How does one enable that?

[21:26] <wolverian> :set filetype=xhtml

[21:26] <Juerd> What does it do except colour?

[21:26] <Khisanth> and what does it do?

[21:26] <wolverian> e.g. <foo>> inserts <foo>\nindentation\n</foo>

[21:27] <wolverian> I think it also adds omnicompletion, but not sure.

[21:27] <Juerd> Doesn't for me.

[21:27] <wolverian> maybe I got it from vim.org

[21:27] <Khisanth> doesn't do it for me either

[21:27] <Juerd> I just write html and when I need it to be xhtml, i postprocess it.

[21:27] <wolverian> yeah. it's not a core script.

[21:28] <Juerd> width="123" sucks.

[21:28] <Juerd> width=123 feels much better both to mind and hands.

[21:33] *** bonesss joined
[21:34] <lichtkind> tscha

[21:35] <Juerd> wolverian: <img></img> isn't very useful though

[21:36] <Juerd> And I still need to quote integers myself

[21:38] <wolverian> it shouldn't do that if you type <img />, surely. and yeah. that's more of gnu tidy's job.

[21:38] <wolverian> I don't need to write attributes with numbers much

[21:38] <Juerd> Why should *I* have to type that /?

[21:39] <Juerd> Wasn't the cool thing about DTDs that they could indicate EMPTY?

[21:39] <Juerd> XML is only user friendly with a full blown schema-and-dtd-supporting xml editor, which vim is not

[21:41] <moritz> xml is mainly intended to be written and parsed by computers, not humans

[21:42] <Juerd> It's utterly verbose for a computer language.

[21:42] <Juerd> So I don't believe this.

[21:43] <Juerd> And, I want to type my own html

[21:43] <Juerd> Because all software sucks at doing it.

[21:43] <moritz> same for me

[21:45] <wolverian> well, I agree.

[21:45] <wolverian> I don't write much (x)html, which is why I don't feel the pain so much, I suppose.

[21:46] *** Talaman72 joined
[21:47] <moritz> well, nearly all of my html is xhtml 1.0 strict, and it's just a matter of getting used to it
