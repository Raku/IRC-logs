[05:29] <diotalevi> What is the meaning of when( $foo || $bar )? Is it ($_ ~~ ( $foo || $bar )) or is it (($_ ~~ $foo) || ($_ ~~ $bar))?

[05:30] *** ysth1 joined
[05:30] <diotalevi> I'm asking this in connection with Perl 5's port of that.

[05:32] <diotalevi> The S06 doesn't seem to clarify.

[05:32] <diotalevi> it was 6, right, ysth1?

[05:36] <diotalevi> also, the synopsis is not clear about how to turn off smartmatching.

[05:37] <Tene> "turn off smartmatching"?

[05:37] <diotalevi> yes, evaluate the conditional in a when() expression as an ordinary boolean instead of ( $_ ~~ ... )

[05:39] *** devogon joined
[05:47] <ysth1> S04 Switch statements

[05:48] <ysth1> for instance, when ($_ > 4) ; there, the when-expression isn't to be smartmatched

[05:49] <ysth1> did the original p5 patch specify his source for that kind of stuff, I wonder?

[05:51] *** rfordinal joined
[05:53] <ysth1> no, it doesn't; just says "follow the Perl 6 spec as closely as seemed reasonable"

[06:03] *** BinGOs_ is now known as BinGOs

[06:04] <ysth1> aha; http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2005/12/msg107366.html

[06:04] <lambdabot> Title: Re: switch - nntp.perl.org, http://tinyurl.com/yvhobt

[06:04] <ysth1> in p6, the condition being in { } de-smarts it

[06:05] <ysth1> rats

[06:08] <ysth1> Josh, you still listening?

[06:09] <ysth1> err, diotalevi aka jjore aka josh aka jbenjore

[06:09] <diotalevi> yep

[06:10] <diotalevi> that thing from damian is nice but what's the reference for that?

[06:10] <ysth1> the mouth of the damian

[06:10] <ysth1> { } is p5's do { } I think

[06:10] <ysth1> (me is highly ignorant)

[06:11] <ysth1> but that doesn't address what p6 does with ||/&& in a when condition

[06:11] <ysth1> for some reason I was thinking it did

[06:11] <diotalevi> aaah!

[06:11] <diotalevi> {} is just a closure.

[06:11] <ysth1> which is not a smartmatch operand

[06:12] <ysth1> I guess

[06:12] <diotalevi> sure it is.

[06:12] <ysth1> then why does when { $_ > 4 } work?

[06:12] *** Ashizawa joined
[06:13] <diotalevi> it's just $_ ~~ sub { $_ > 4 } which itself $_ > 4

[06:14] <diotalevi> so this also means perl 5 could possibly use sub{} as the sanity operator.

[06:15] <diotalevi> !!0|| is pretty though.

[06:16] <ysth1> oh

[06:17] <diotalevi> oh neat. Thomas Edison on wax roll or similar.

[06:18] <ysth1> I've heard that before

[06:18] <diotalevi> I might have.

[06:19] *** justatheory left
[06:19] <ysth1> I think $_ ~~ sub { $_ > 4 } is sub { $_ > 4 }->($_) *unless* $_ is a coderef; then it's $_ == sub { $_ > 4 }  ?

[06:20] <ysth1> eddies in the continuum

[06:20] <diotalevi> yes, I guess.

[06:21] <diotalevi> however since you wrote a fresh reference $_ != sub { ... } is always true when $_ is a code ref.

[06:21] <ysth1> yup

[06:21] <ysth1> less than useful

[06:23] <ysth1> or maybe not.  given( sub{} ) { when (sub {$_ > 4}) {} when (sub {$_ <= 4}) {} default { say "surprise!" } }

[06:24] <ysth1> It even works!

[14:20] <masak> araujo: a macaw is a kind of parrot

[14:20] <masak> just so happens that you can construct a composite word out of "arao" (macaw) and "ujo" (container) in esperanto. the middle "o" then disappears.

[14:30] <araujo> that's esperanto right?

[14:30] <masak> yes

[14:30] <masak> the first one was: "it happens that I can speak without problem with spanish-speakers"

[16:11] <masak> Tene: as a speaker of esperanto, I confess to having a few prejudices about lojban. for example, I've heard some people claiming that it's not possible to carry on a conversation in lojban. therefore it's comforting to actually get to meet someone who actually speaks the language

[16:57] <TimToady> diotalevi> What is the meaning of when( $foo || $bar )?

[16:57] <TimToady> actually, that just calls the when() subroutine.  :)

[16:57] <TimToady> which probably doesn't exist

[16:58] <TimToady> (statement_control keywords require a following whitespace)

[16:59] <TimToady> the idea is future-proofing your foo() calls from an accidental "foo" keyword that someone might add later.

[17:11] <avar> TimToady: re recent use.perl thingy, what was laking in ::TRE? re::engine::TRE deficiencies or..?

[17:12] <avar> I noticed that you said you had trouble seeing what path the match took, not suprisingly:)

[17:12] *** cmarcelo left
[17:13] <TimToady> to use TRE for that, a pattern like /(()|())/ has to examine each capture, when TRE actually knew which one it set exactly at the point it was setting it

[17:13] <TimToady> I mean, the wrapping code has to examine each capture

[17:14] <avar> yes, and compare it with the pattern?

[17:14] <TimToady> and STD tends to produce something like (()|()|()|()|()|()|()|()|()|())

[17:14] <TimToady> I just want to know that $7 is the one that matched without looking at $6

[17:14] <avar> kp6 handles this by putting embedded evals everywhere that keep track of the progress

[17:15] <TimToady> I'm just gonna write my own NFA traverser in P6

[17:15] <avar> ah, 5.10 also makes that easier:)

[17:15] <TimToady> need it eventually anyway

[17:15] <TimToady> and then I can make it remember whatever I want it to remember

[17:16] <TimToady> it's not *that* hard to write a regex matcher that proceeds character by character and keeps track of sets of states

[17:17] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:17] <TimToady> just have to keep track of your epsilons and your follow sets

[17:18] *** cmarcelo joined
[17:18] <TimToady> and for typical lexer usage, there aren't going to be a lot of states to keep track of

[17:19] <TimToady> alternatives tend to disqualify themselves faster than match positions multiply

[17:19] <TimToady> and everything is anchored to the current position

[17:20] <TimToady> lexers tend to be well behaved that way

[17:20] <TimToady> you're not scanning hundreds of bytes for a fugitive pattern

[17:20] <fglock> PCR regex does state tracking, but it's probably not in the same sense

[17:21] <TimToady> not unless all your alternatives run in parallel over each char of input

[17:21] <TimToady> that's what I'm aiming for

[17:22] *** franck___ left
[17:22] <TimToady> I not only have to find the longest token, but I'd like to remember where the 2nd longest, 3rd longest, etc were too

[17:22] <TimToady> in case I need to backtrack on an "endsym" assertion or other delayed assertion

[17:23] <fglock> it's possible to modify it  - http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule/lib/Pugs/Runtime/Regex.pm in 'sub alternation'

[17:23] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yvlx8k

[17:23] <TimToady> a token is allowed to say 'foo' <?{ bar() }> 'baz' for instance

[17:24] <TimToady> and the lexer only looks for 'foobar', and checks the assertion later

[17:24] <TimToady> 'foobaz', rather

[17:25] <TimToady> which we can do, assuming the regex match is "pure", and that it remembers the position to run the assertion at

[17:25] <TimToady> but it implies that longest token matching is provisional, and might backtrack to a shorter longest token.

[17:26] <fglock> yes, it looks doable

[17:26] *** rlb3_work left
[17:27] <fglock> though PCR:Regex is a bit too slow for real use

[17:27] <TimToady> well, sure, but the whole STD thing is proof of concept for now

[17:28] <TimToady> or disproof, as the case may be :)
