[08:33] <lambdabot> TimToady said 15h 16m 14s ago: actually, := is already specced to fail if the type is inconsistent, S03:1003

[08:34] <audreyt> @tell TimToady So is it okay to say "my $x; $x := [1,2,3]" works because "my $x is Any" is annotated, but "my Any $x; $x := [1,2,3]" fails because it means "my $x is Scalar of Any" and [1,2,3] is not a scalar?

[08:34] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[08:38] <gaal> hey audreyt

[08:40] <audreyt> ok, see, ghc doesn't know what type pos should be

[08:41] <gaal> there's also instance Boxable PureInt and instance Boxable Int

[08:41] <audreyt> \ str sub (pos :: PureInt)

[08:41] *** iblechbot joined
[08:41] <audreyt> is one way

[08:41] <audreyt> (Str.drop pos str)

[08:41] <audreyt> is another way

[08:41] <gaal> oh, the incoming type?

[08:41] <audreyt> yeah

[08:41] <audreyt> it only knows that it's Boxable

[08:41] <audreyt> and it can be casted to Int

[08:41] <audreyt> but that's insufficient info

[08:42] <gaal> ok: changing (cast pos) to pos makes the error:

[08:42] <gaal> No instance for (Boxable (Int -> Val))

[08:42] <gaal> but that means I have an arity error somewhere doesn't it?

[08:43] <audreyt> well, yeah

[08:43] <gaal> I don't see it :(

[08:43] <audreyt> can you nopaste the patch

[08:43] <audreyt> or commit it?

[08:44] <gaal> nopaste coming up...

[08:44] <pasteling> "gaal" at 192.115.25.249 pasted "index" (71 lines, 2.3K) at http://sial.org/pbot/23325

[08:44] <audreyt> oh ok

[08:44] <audreyt> because it did not fit the instance

[08:44] <audreyt> see, you are working with

[08:45] <audreyt> PureStr -> PureStr -> Int -> Val

[08:45] <audreyt> but your instance is a->b->c->Eval z

[08:45] <audreyt> you need either a

[08:45] <audreyt> a->b->c->z

[08:45] <audreyt> or a 

[08:45] <audreyt> a->b->c->Val

[08:45] <gaal> oh, so add 'return'?

[08:45] <audreyt> no

[08:45] *** the_dormant joined
[08:45] <audreyt> add an autoderiv

[08:45] <audreyt> -- Auto-generate pure instances from Eval instances

[08:45] <audreyt> instance MethodPrimable (a -> b -> Eval z) a => MethodPrimable (a -> b -> z) a where asPrim f = asPrim ((\x args -> return (f x args)) :: (a -> b -> Eval z))

[08:45] <audreyt> similar to this

[08:46] <audreyt> but 3ary not 2

[08:46] <audreyt> adding return would do

[08:46] <audreyt> but that's not sufficiently pointless

[08:46] <gaal> wow that instance is very moose

[08:48] <audreyt> :D

[08:48] <gaal> okay; I added the instance and now I get: No instance for (Boxable (Invocant Eval))

[08:48] <audreyt> (customizable contexts)++

[08:49] <gaal> instance MethodPrimable (a -> b -> c -> Eval z) a => MethodPrimable (a -> b -> c -> z) a where asPrim f = asPrim ((\x y args -> return (f x y args)) :: (a -> b -> c -> Eval z))

[08:49] <audreyt> ok, that means Val is not boxable atm

[08:49] <gaal> isn't Val's box id?

[08:49] <audreyt> correct

[08:50] <gaal> should I add the instance or is it a mistake to have to use it?

[08:50] <gaal> and, how come it wasn't needed in the other methods?

[08:50] <audreyt> because they all just return something

[08:50] <gaal> oh, as opposed to a Val

[08:50] <audreyt> right.

[08:50] <gaal> because I'm already mkValing inside

[08:50] <gaal> okok

[08:51] <audreyt> dunno... I can argue either way

[08:51] <audreyt> another thought is to simply write another instance of MPrimable

[08:51] <audreyt> that has ->Eval Val

[08:51] <audreyt> instead of Eval z

[08:51] <audreyt> that feels slightly cleaner

[08:51] <audreyt> also avoids two unneccessary method calls

[08:51] <audreyt> (the fmap mkVal)

[08:52] <audreyt> so maybe do that instead?

[08:52] <gaal> you mean inside the two mkVals inside the index method?

[08:52] <audreyt> nono, I'm comparing writing another MPrimable instance

[08:52] <audreyt> with writing an instance of Boxable Val

[08:52] <audreyt> I think the former (writing an instance that has no fmap mkVal in it) makes more sense

[08:53] <audreyt> feels funny to double box into id

[08:53] *** Schwern joined
[08:53] <audreyt> so I mean

[08:53] <audreyt> instance (Boxable a, Boxable b, Boxable c) => MethodPrimable (a -> b -> c -> Eval Val) a where

[08:53] <audreyt> ...you know the rest...

[08:54] <audreyt> yet another thought (hey) is to leave sensible errors

[08:54] <gaal> oh; but then we'd need to write two insances for every new arity

[08:54] <gaal> potentially

[08:54] <audreyt> well, not really, because we can autoderiv too

[08:54] <audreyt> but well

[08:54] <gaal> one for MPrim and one for Boxable

[08:54] <gaal> er sorry

[08:54] <audreyt> one for Val and one for B

[08:54] <gaal> one for Eval z and one for Eval Val

[08:54] <audreyt> and one for z

[08:55] <audreyt> the z one covers Val too

[08:55] <audreyt> dunno, the arity is finite

[08:55] <audreyt> not really a loss

[08:55] <gaal> yeah this fever isn't helping my typechecker output layer

[08:55] <gaal> I don't see how autoderiv would work, but ok

[08:55] <gaal> that can happen later

[08:56] <audreyt> nod

[08:56] <gaal> where does the [::]ification of captures happen? in Prelude.pm ::internal methods?

[08:57] <gaal> that is, the rearrangement of args to a list

[08:57] <audreyt> hm, index now returns undef instead of -1?

[08:57] <audreyt> this is going to be fun!

[08:57] <gaal> according to Functions.pod, yeah

[08:57] * audreyt ponders "undef but -1"

[08:57] <gaal> yeah

[08:57] <audreyt> I mean, people would rely on -1

[08:58] <audreyt> how about -1 for now?

[08:58] <gaal> the is 0 .. undef empty?

[08:58] <gaal> s/the//

[08:58] <audreyt> feeling really bad about plain undef

[08:59] <audreyt> it's currently specified as a warning but (0..0)

[08:59] <audreyt> so just return -1 and we avoid the Eval-Val business altogether

[08:59] <gaal> I think that's where it'll hurt most

[08:59] <audreyt> I'll annotate the Functions.pod

[08:59] <gaal> okay

[09:06] <audreyt> gaal: we shouldn't. we should use UTF8

[09:06] <audreyt> which is a utf view of bytestring

[09:06] <audreyt> it's in src/UTF8.hs

[09:06] <audreyt> so just change the import line

[09:07] <audreyt> because both share the ByteString basetype

[09:07] <audreyt> it's just the operations (index length etc)

[09:07] <gaal> hmm

[09:07] <audreyt> it's really a view on Buf

[09:07] <gaal> ack

[09:07] <audreyt> and yes, we should switch to Rope once the new fps is out

[09:08] <audreyt> with concat strings and encoding views

[09:08] <audreyt> but The Day Is Not Today etc

[09:08] <audreyt> should be trivial, just another import change

[09:08] <audreyt> indeed.

[09:09] <gaal> (not that I don't see the hypocricy in my -+)

[09:11] <audreyt> <sleepingsquirrel> Programming in Haskell is like having an interactive conversation with a teleportation machine.

[09:11] <audreyt> <sleepingsquirrel> You tell it you want to go to some place warm and sandy. The machine complains about ambiguous constraints.

[09:11] <audreyt> <sleepingsquirrel> So you tell it that there should be plenty of free tropical fruit drinks. It carps 'Inferred location less polymorphic than expected'.

[09:11] <audreyt> <sleepingsquirrel> After a few more iterations, there's a little puff of smoke, and at the sound of the chimes, you discover you're now on the beach in Tahiti.

[09:11] <audreyt> <sleepingsquirrel> And although you've used the machine many times before, you can't help but be impressed that it usually 'Just works' most of the time.

[11:48] <audreyt> oops, retold

[11:51] <fglock> audreyt: in 6-on-5, I've been thinking about implementing p6 pads as p5 classes

[14:08] <fglock> I found new ones

[14:09] <kolibrie> ahh

[14:09] <fglock> there is a problem with backtracking and zero-width matches

[14:10] <kolibrie> if it backtracks, then matches a zero-width match?

[14:10] <fglock> I didn't fully understand the problem yet

[14:10] <kolibrie> <token> | <''>

[14:12] <fglock> it seems that even '^' can be a problem

[14:12] <kolibrie> so, something to do with backtracking and zero-width matches, but the exact problem is still to be determined?

[15:22] <kolibrie> driving through Boston in May is much more likely

[15:26] <gaal> audreyt: how newval-ready is VRule? should I transcribe methods that use res, such as $s.split(//)?

[15:28] <audreyt> gaal: sure. just add Boxable to VRule

[15:28] <audreyt> and add a cast in Pugs.AST line 61

[17:23] <audreyt> I'll brainstorm it here and check for sanity

[17:23] <audreyt> ok. I've eliminated MkEntryMulti.

[17:23] * gaal summons anatoly

[17:23] <audreyt> now a multi is simply a Val that contains a set of Code

[17:23] <audreyt> just as we planned

[17:23] <audreyt> there are two issues here.

[17:23] <audreyt> one is that we need to write

[17:24] <audreyt> instance Monoid PureSig

[17:24] <audreyt> such that when we are faced with three multis

[17:24] <audreyt> we can find the common-subset-interface of it to advertise to the outside world

[17:25] <gaal> *nod*

[17:25] *** Kattana joined
[17:25] <audreyt> which means we need to Monoid on Cxt

[17:25] <audreyt> and LValueness

[17:25] <audreyt> for each param, as well

[17:25] *** anatolyv joined
[17:26] <audreyt> so let's see... rw `mappend` nonrw = rw

[17:26] <gaal> hey anatolyv 

[17:26] <audreyt> anatolyv: greetings

[17:26] <anatolyv> hey audrey, gaal

[17:27] *** justatheory joined
[17:27] <audreyt> now anatolyv is here I'll move on to issue #2

[17:28] <audreyt> namely to implement S12:796

[17:29] <gaal> "The order in which candidates are considered is defined by a topological sort"...

[17:29] <audreyt> yes

[17:29] <audreyt> we have a Set of Signature here, and a single CaptVal

[17:29] <wolverian> is writing a Num instance the sanest way to get a negation operation for your datatype? :)

[17:29] <audreyt> wolverian: or define -: or something

[17:29] <wolverian> yeah. I was looking for Data.Abelian or so... ;)

[17:29] <audreyt> the CaptVal is already reduced according to the multi's proto-sig

[17:30] <audreyt> i.e. the `mconcat` of all its variants

[17:30] <gaal> nod

[17:30] <TimToady> audreyt: I suspect Scalar has to be smart enough to be able to wrap up an Any into a Scalar of Any when bound.

[17:30] <lambdabot> TimToady: You have 3 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[17:31] <audreyt> so we have a partial ordering between the Sig, defined over the CaptVal

[17:31] <[particle]> i'd like to see a bot that can convert synopsis verses to text

[17:31] <[particle]> S12:796?

[17:31] <gaal> [particle]++ # great idea

[17:32] <wolverian> I want a bot that rewrites the synopses in pentameter

[17:32] <audreyt> what's a good way to write the topological sort itself?

[17:32] <ingy> morning

[17:32] <gaal> heya ingy

[17:32] <TimToady> and I think not worrying about multi on anons is fine, since the purpose of multies is to share a short name, and anons ain't got one.

[17:32] *** elmex joined
[17:32] <ingy> hi gaal

[17:33] <audreyt> we have: (candidates :: Set Sig), (compare :: Sig -> Sig -> Ordering), and we'd like to find a Sig that is GT every other

[17:34] <audreyt> I suspect there is something in Data.Graph.Inductive.Basic that simply solves this

[17:34] <gaal> yes, since your exposition already abstraced out the Perlish parts

[17:35] <gaal> lookign there.

[17:35] <audreyt> *nod*

[17:35] *** phiker joined
[17:36] <audreyt> I'd like to not code topological sort myself if possible; I'll get it wrong surely, esp 1:35am now :)

[17:36] <wolverian> Data.Graph has topSort certainly

[17:36] <wolverian> so does inductive, but not in .Basic, forgot where

[17:37] <audreyt> the function should be

[17:37] <audreyt> Set Sig -> Maybe Sig

[17:37] <wolverian> oh, .DFS

[17:37] <audreyt> it returns Just iff there's only one valid topsort

[17:37] <audreyt> in all other case it's Nothing

[17:37] <gaal> @index topSort

[17:37] <lambdabot> Data.Graph

[17:38] <wolverian> @index topsort

[17:38] <lambdabot> Data.Graph.Inductive.Query.DFS, Data.Graph.Inductive.Query, Data.Graph.Inductive

[17:38] <gaal> "A topological sort of the graph. The order is partially specified by the condition that a vertex i  precedes j whenever j is reachable from i but not vice versa.

[17:38] <gaal> "

[17:38] <gaal> not quite what we want though?

[17:38] <audreyt> the one in Inductive.Query is

[17:39] <audreyt> provided by dfs

[17:39] <gaal> ahhh

[17:39] <audreyt> topsort' :: Graph gr => gr a b -> [a]

[17:39] <gaal> so, listToMaybe . topSort'

[17:40] <audreyt> can you (or wolverian, or anatolyv) test that it does work? :)

[17:40] <gaal> you mean outside of Perl yes? :)

[17:40] <TimToady> but let me think about the binding think some more

[17:40] <audreyt> in Hs, yes.

[17:40] <anatolyv> ugh, probably not me, i'm disconnected from my stuff at the moment :)

[17:40] <gaal> sure :)

[17:41] <audreyt> woot :) that will get us True Multi Dispatch

[17:41] <audreyt> as currently proto already works

[17:41] <audreyt> and subs does shadow multis

[17:41] <gaal> woot

[17:42] <audreyt> TimToady: so is nameds part of the long name, or not?

[17:42] <anatolyv> is topsort enough, for practical purposes? maybe there's an incentive to put more fundamental types first, among uncomparables

[17:42] <wolverian> sorry, my coding laptop is offline at the moment, hopefully gaal can hack it :)

[17:42] <audreyt> S06 and S12 are a bit confusing here

[17:42] <anatolyv> foo(Int) and foo(Moose)

[17:43] <TimToady> not sure what you mean by "nameds"

[17:43] <TimToady> oh, named params

[17:43] <TimToady> it's still too early :(

[17:43] <gaal> have coffee, will be sentient

[17:44] <Aankhen``> LMAO.

[17:44] <audreyt> TimToady: multi foo (:$x!) {...}

[17:44] <audreyt> multi foo (Int :$x!) { ... }

[17:44] <TimToady> at the moment the official story is that only positionals (and nameds remapped as positional with proto) participate in 6.0.0, but it's erroneous to assume nameds won't be added later

[17:45] <audreyt> k

[17:45] <TimToady> however, if we decide we know how to add them before 6.0.0, that'd be nice

[17:45] <TimToady> 'course, I have a vague recollection that I used nameds in longnames somewhere in *STD

[17:45] <audreyt> slurpies are part of longname already...

[17:45] <audreyt> and they come after nameds in zoning

[17:46] <audreyt> so it's a bit contradictory, considering ;;'s placement

[17:46] <TimToady> I think I was only relying on failure if there is no such parameter name

[17:46] <fglock> what does a long name look like? (or is it just a data structure)

[17:46] <audreyt> fglock: currently in Pugs, a longname is simply a Signature

[17:47] <audreyt> I was trying to determine if it's a restricted form of Signature

[17:47] <audreyt> or if the full form is sane enough to use

[17:47] * gaal praises Data.Graph.Inductive.Example

[17:48] <TimToady> I suppose we should aim for what the user expects, and then see where it needs optimizing

[17:48] <audreyt> k

[17:48] <audreyt> TimToady: so the earlier issue #1 (instance Monoid Signature)

[17:48] <TimToady> and the user will likely expect nameds to participate as if bound already

[17:48] <wolverian> gaal, are you finding inductive sane to work with? 

[17:48] <audreyt> in p6speak, that issue can be phreased: should p6 generate protos from several multis of no proto is present?

[17:49] <gaal> wolverian: haven't really started yet!

[17:49] <wolverian> okay :)

[17:49] <audreyt> that is, it seems to me that we need to somehow find a "common subset" that subsumes all candidates

[17:49] <wolverian> I found it hard, but that was probably because I didn't read the paper until later

[17:50] <TimToady> seems like it could lead to a false generalization if the user is planning to add more multis later via eval, which is officially within the lexical scope

[17:50] <audreyt> because that is the only way we can propagate common type/context/lvalueness contexts into the expressions

[17:50] <audreyt> consider:

[17:50] <TimToady> or eval has to recalculate the proto

[17:50] <audreyt> I was leaning toward recalculating the proto

[17:50] <TimToady> recalc of proto is okay for eval, I expect

[17:51] <audreyt> multi f (Int $x, Str $y) {}; multi f (Int $x, Moose $y) {}

[17:51] <audreyt> f(want(), want())

[17:51] <audreyt> or rather

[17:51] <TimToady> i know what you mena

[17:51] <TimToady> *mean

[17:51] <audreyt> yeah.

[17:52] <audreyt> so is it safe to say (that is, to test) that the first expr gets Int as want?

[17:52] <TimToady> you think the want type is the intersection of the proto and the actual (if known) context?

[17:52] <phiker> mugwump, ping

[17:52] <audreyt> uhm, what actual?

[17:52] <TimToady> er, right

[17:53] <audreyt> the want type is the bound-as-proto, and proto is calculated by intersection if not present

[17:53] <audreyt> reason this is needed is that anything evaluated as ITEM can't go back and be reevaluated as LIST, and vice versa

[17:53] <TimToady> in other words, can it be the actual context

[17:54] <TimToady> @foo ||= @bar

[17:54] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: faq ft todo yow

[17:54] <audreyt> that's solved at macro level

[17:54] <audreyt> same as =

[17:54] <audreyt> more like

[17:55] <audreyt> before it enters multi dispatch

[17:55] <TimToady> basically, can we partially dispatch on generated proto

[17:55] <audreyt> or rather, we had a 

[17:55] <Debolaz> Does pugs support installing into a custom prefix now btw?

[17:55] <audreyt> Capt Exp

[17:56] <audreyt> which is a capture of expressions

[17:56] <audreyt> we'd like to reduce it to Capt Val

[17:56] <audreyt> which is a capture of reduced values

[17:56] <audreyt> but we can't use any information on the actual multis

[17:56] <audreyt> because multi dispatch acts on values

[17:56] <audreyt> but I'd like to have some hint

[17:56] <audreyt> if proto is present, it's specced to be the hint

[17:56] <audreyt> but if it's not, spec is silent

[17:57] <audreyt> and I'd like it to dwim, namely find the unifying proto that all multis agree

[17:57] <TimToady> type inferencey

[17:57] <audreyt> and unify to Any, that is to say VAR() context with no type hints

[17:57] <TimToady> Int|Str

[17:57] <audreyt> if things disagree on context

[17:58] <audreyt> Int|Str is fine, as types can unify like that

[17:58] <audreyt> but ITEM/LIST is nonunifiable...

[17:58] <audreyt> Int|Any is just Any, too

[17:58] <audreyt> it is type inferency, but otherwise in the face of

[17:58] <audreyt> f(g()) 

[17:58] <audreyt> without a proto f and with only multi f

[17:59] <TimToady> so basically, can we relax/tighten the rule that says if you don't know, it's list context, if all participating multis show item?

[17:59] <TimToady> then you know it's item.

[17:59] <TimToady> I think we can do that.

[17:59] <audreyt> yes. also, if any of multis want rw, we want rw.

[17:59] <TimToady> seems fine to me, as long as we recalc in eval.

[17:59] <audreyt> since we can always get ITEM/LIST out of a lvalue

[17:59] <audreyt> but not the other way around

[17:59] <TimToady> (if necessary)

[18:00] <audreyt> yup

[18:00] <audreyt> yay.

[18:00] <wolverian> is the enum spec still in flux?

[18:00] <audreyt> Debolaz: custom prefix?

[18:00] <TimToady> seems dwtwy enough.

[18:01] <TimToady> *dwtmy

[18:01] <audreyt> ?eval sub prefix:<~Y~> ($x) { "$x will dwim, or at least do something..." }; ~Y~ "Perl 6"

[18:02] <evalbot_r15509> "Perl 6 will dwim, or at least do something..."

[18:02] <audreyt> Debolaz: do you mean that?

[18:02] <TimToady> wolverian: it's been pretty solid for a while, unless we get pushback from the darn implementors.  :)

[18:02] <TimToady> wolverian: did you want to tweak something?

[18:04] <TimToady> hmm, with the proto generation, enum collisions could just be considered 0-ary functions that generate a proto that can't match anything.

[18:05] <TimToady> then you automatically get the Ada semantics of failing if two modules export conflicting names to the same namespace. 

[18:05] <audreyt> but enums ne multis...

[18:05] *** mr_ank joined
[18:05] <TimToady> just thinking mechanism

[18:05] <audreyt> k

[18:06] <TimToady> enums are types and constant values at the same time

[18:06] * audreyt goes back implementing the preceding steps toward bogo, er topo, sort

[18:06] <TimToady> and constants can be represented by 0-ary subs

[18:06] <TimToady> as in "use constant"

[18:07] <TimToady> if they were represented with 0-ary multies we might get collision detection for freebies

[18:07] <TimToady> is all I'm saying

[18:07] <audreyt> ah.

[18:07] <audreyt> they share long names, though

[18:08] <TimToady> longname and shortname is the same for ()

[18:08] <TimToady> isn't it?

[18:08] <audreyt> true. but the spec currently says on colliding longname, later one masks

[18:08] <audreyt> S12:775

[18:08] <audreyt> this is done before proto autogen

[18:09] <audreyt> maybe a redefinition warning?

[18:09] <TimToady> that would be fine for enums too, I suppose

[18:09] <audreyt> *nod* then already plan to do that

[18:09] <TimToady> as you were

[18:09] <TimToady> back to backlogging...

[18:14] <audreyt> @djinn [a] -> (a -> a -> Ordering) -> Maybe a

[18:14] <lambdabot> f _ _ = Nothing

[18:14] <audreyt> ok... _very_ useful, thanks djinn

[18:14] <gaal> pwned

[18:15] <audreyt> Debolaz: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX= doesn't dtrt?

[18:15] <TimToady> audreyt: now I'm wondering if Scalar/Any is really Any/any, and := just autoboxes the [...] any into an Any.

[18:15] <audreyt> ok... let's see

[18:16] <audreyt> Scalar is something that can accept infix:<=>

[18:16] <Debolaz> audreyt: I'll update to the most recent version, try again, and put up the full output of the installation if it fails.

[18:16] <audreyt> Debolaz: k

[18:16] <audreyt> Debolaz: also maketicket on dev.pugscode.org lest we forget

[18:16] <audreyt> (you do have a commit bit right?)

[18:17] <audreyt> TimToady: and [...] can't quite be assigned to.

[18:17] <allbery_b> the pugs INSTALL document does say that PREFIX= does not DTRT

[18:17] <Debolaz> audreyt: Yes.

[18:17] <audreyt> my $x := [1,2,3]; $x = 3; # will fail

[18:17] <audreyt> but the binding succeeds because $x is unannotated

[18:17] <audreyt> however, I'd expect

[18:17] <allbery_b> "XXXX NOTE!!!!!!!! PREFIX doesn't actually work right now."

[18:18] <audreyt> my $x is Scalar := [1,2,3] # to fail right there

[18:18] <wolverian> TimToady, not really, just thinking about data Foo = Bar | Baz in perl6, thinking "enum" is a weird name for that.

[18:18] <audreyt> otoh,

[18:18] <audreyt> my $x is Any := [1,2,3] # ought to work

[18:18] <audreyt> (sometimes I wonder if we should just allow * in type context so people won't look for a ::Any, because there isn't.)

[18:18] <audreyt> i.e. there is no concrete ^Any that does anything meaningful

[18:18] <audreyt> rather it's only meaningful as a type

[18:19] <audreyt> in any case.

[18:19] <wolverian> then again, "data" is a pretty horrid name too

[18:19] <audreyt> my $x is Int := 1; $x := 2; # should work

[18:19] <audreyt> my $x is Scalar := 1; # should fail

[18:19] <audreyt> the question was

[18:20] <audreyt> my Any $x; # should it be ignored and treated the same as "my $x"?

[18:20] <audreyt> my intuition is yes

[18:20] <audreyt> but

[18:20] <audreyt> my Object $x; # means "my $x is Scalar of Object"

[18:20] <audreyt> so

[18:20] <audreyt> my Object $x; $x := [1,2,3] # can fail

[18:20] <audreyt> </working-assumptions>

[18:21] <TimToady> maybe just silently turn "my Any $x" into "my $x"?

[18:21] <audreyt> *nod*

[18:21] <audreyt> my Int $x; $x := 3; # should this fail or box?

[18:21] <audreyt> I guess box

[18:22] <TimToady> that's probably what they want

[18:22] <audreyt> my $x is Int := 0; # works

[18:22] <TimToady> though = would get them there

[18:22] <audreyt> my $x is Int := 0; $x = 123 # fails

[18:22] <audreyt> that much is given

[18:22] <fglock> random idea... - make different versions of mp6 with backend-optimized capabilities

[18:22] <audreyt> yeah. the question is to when to fail

[18:23] <audreyt> I think fail later is fin

[18:23] <audreyt> fine

[18:23] <audreyt> because, that is what happens in

[18:24] <audreyt> sub f (Int $x is rw) { ... }; f(3)

[18:24] <TimToady> I'd say it's one of those things where it's guaranteed to fail at runtime but okay to prognosticate at compile time when you know it will fail at runtime

[18:24] <audreyt> sure. but what if the user only read it?

[18:24] <audreyt> my Int $x; $x := 3; say $x + 3;

[18:25] <audreyt> kosher the?

[18:25] <audreyt> kosher then?

[18:25] <TimToady> why not?

[18:25] <audreyt> cool

[18:25] <TimToady> is the = that will fail

[18:25] <audreyt> my Int $x; $x := [6,7,8]; # fails? Coerce-Array-to-3?

[18:26] <audreyt> coercing would be rather horrible, yet that's what currently happens with the uncommitted pugs

[18:26] <TimToady> but we can know that in the lexical scope, probably, assuming some sub doesn't rebind it

[18:26] <audreyt> (because Int([6,7,8]) == 3)

[18:27] <TimToady> sure, I think we can just blame the user there

[18:27] <audreyt> ok...

[18:27] <audreyt> I guess :)

[18:27] * audreyt goes back blaming the user

[18:27] <TimToady> attempted coercion is how we see if the types are compatible, I guess.

[18:28] <audreyt> *nod*

[18:28] <ajs_> If coercing and boxing can be told apart, I would expect that only the latter would ever be allowed with :=. Coercing implies the creation of a temporary that may have little or no relation to the given data to which the user thinks they're binding.

[18:28] <audreyt> currently the coercion is performed in this order

[18:28] <audreyt> Int([6,7,8]) calls first Array.Int

[18:29] <audreyt> if not found, then &Int(Array)

[18:29] <audreyt> i.e. the thing being coerced gets the first say

[18:29] <audreyt> this is good enough in the simplistic view of the world

[18:29] <audreyt> thong I wonder how can it plan nicely with perl6:Int-1.0.0

[18:30] * [particle] *coughs*

[18:30] <audreyt> ajs_: yes, hence "horrible" above

[18:32] <ajs_> Is := really coercing though? Should it even touch the coercing logic? Or is ^foo.box an identity for all high-level types that gets invoked anywhere that boxing might be required?

[18:32] <TimToady> what's the problem with that?  Int can only be aliased to a single module longname in a given lexical scope

[18:33] <audreyt> TimToady: sure. but what if MyArray wants to define two methods

[18:33] *** offby1 joined
[18:33] <audreyt> one for Int-1.0 and one for Int-2.0?

[18:34] <audreyt> do we have a 

[18:34] <audreyt> sub "\0\0\0" { ... }

[18:34] <audreyt> form?

[18:34] <TimToady> that's part of why I was thinking about going to a module name more of the form Int:(:ver(1.0), :auth<JRANDOM>)

[18:34] * ajs_ goes back to work

[18:35] <TimToady> or something like that

[18:35] <audreyt> Int:<1.0 JRandom>

[18:35] <audreyt> etc

[18:35] <audreyt> but got your point

[18:35] <TimToady> would prefer extensible :foo inside

[18:35] <audreyt> but that means we extend that to var space too

[18:35] <TimToady> but Int:ver():auth() would maybe work

[18:36] <audreyt> can live with that

[18:36] <audreyt> hopefully canonicalize the part nameds with simple sort

[18:36] <TimToady> was wondering if we keep the Int-1.0 form as sugar

[18:36] <audreyt> so it can end up storing as a simple string

[18:36] <audreyt> and not worry about normalization

[18:36] <audreyt> noncomparable IDs are really bad :)

[18:36] <TimToady> *nod*

[18:36] *** explorer joined
[18:37] <TimToady> but basicaly it's a name mangling discipline

[18:37] <TimToady> with real delims on what will be mangled

[18:37] <audreyt> yup

[18:37] <audreyt> Int:ver<3>:ver<4>

[18:37] <audreyt> same as Int:ver<4>?

[18:38] <TimToady> Int:ver(v3|v4)?

[18:38] <audreyt> ask because of validity of infix:<+><-><*></>

[18:38] <TimToady> hmm

[18:38] <audreyt> would prefer it to just mean infix:</>

[18:39] <audreyt> infix:<+>:<->:<*>:</> really

[18:39] <TimToady> that sounds to me rather like P5's last-value-of-the-list-itis

[18:39] <audreyt> but same thing

[18:39] <audreyt> *nod*

[18:39] <audreyt> ok, so maybe not, but

[18:39] <audreyt> infix:<x>:<y>

[18:39] <audreyt> infix:<y>:<x>

[18:39] <audreyt> wondering if they mean the same thing as

[18:39] <TimToady> maybe no dups allowed for a given adverb

[18:39] <audreyt> infix:<x y>

[18:39] <audreyt> actualy

[18:40] <audreyt> best if they don't

[18:40] <TimToady> with nameds, dups come in as [,,]

[18:40] <audreyt> then we have a very good syntax

[18:40] <audreyt> circumfix:<(>:<)>

[18:40] <TimToady> same as :<( )>

[18:40] <TimToady> seems good

[18:40] <audreyt> cool

[18:41] <PerlJam> greetings #perl6

[18:41] <audreyt> so any infix with the second part becomes ternary?

[18:41] <audreyt> infix:<foo>:<bar>

[18:41] <audreyt> 3 foo bar 4

[18:42] <audreyt> er

[18:42] <audreyt> 3 foo 4 bar 5

[18:42] <TimToady> maybe--I just hardwired it to look for a properly precedented EXPR for ??!!

[18:42] <TimToady> but could probably generalize

[18:43] <audreyt> k

[18:43] <TimToady> PerlJam: howdy doody

[18:43] <audreyt> so when Pugs.Parser sees infix:<=>

[18:43] *** Psyche^ joined
[18:43] <audreyt> it should install infix:sym<=>

[18:43] <audreyt> in order for STD-hook to work?

[18:44] <TimToady> infix:<=> is the name of the sub, infix:sym<=> is the name of the rule that parses the sub

[18:44] <audreyt> the symness is determined by \w-ness of first char?

[18:44] <audreyt> okay.

[18:44] <TimToady> have to keep the two names straight

[18:44] <PerlJam> Do either of you have a good email address for chromatic?

[18:44] <TimToady> or STD can't talk about its own infix:<=>

[18:45] <audreyt> PerlJam: @wgz.org

[18:45] <PerlJam> audreyt: thanks.

[18:45] <audreyt> np :)

[18:45] <audreyt> TimToady: that's all for it now :) thanks for the explanation

[18:45] <TimToady> hmm, well, I was think of the non-symness determined by the \W-ness, but yes

[18:46] <audreyt> btw, implementatation of STATUS still on hold, but it's not of priority now :)

[18:46] <TimToady> in backlog?

[18:46] <audreyt> quite a while ago

[18:46] <TimToady> k

[18:46] <audreyt> the comment was %hash.:exists{3,4,5}

[18:46] <audreyt> can't be passed as .STATUS(exists => {3,4,5})

[18:46] <audreyt> for obvious reasons

[18:47] <audreyt> so spec is bogus

[18:47] <TimToady> direct will probably be okay

[18:47] <audreyt> k then

[18:47] <audreyt> so .:foo just translates to ~~ foo

[18:47] <audreyt> so .:foo just translates to ~~ :foo

[18:47] <audreyt> that's easy enough

[18:48] <TimToady> still need to work the inversion in there somehow

[18:48] <TimToady> so that the pattern controls the meaning

[18:49] <TimToady> well, will think about that later

[18:49] <TimToady> back to the backlog &

[18:49] <audreyt> :)

[18:50] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[18:53] <fglock> I wonder if it makes sense for pugs to link to perl-5.9.x, and then use the new regex engine in PCR

[18:54] <PerlJam> fglock: why not?  If you need bleeding edge ghc, why not up the perl requirement too  :)

[18:55] <fglock> yes

[18:55] <audreyt> fglock: or you can check $^V...

[18:55] <audreyt> and load two different backends

[18:58] *** jisom joined
[18:59] <TimToady> Is there any important reason why prototypes like Int should be considered true rather than false

[19:00] <audreyt> eval ?Int

[19:00] <TimToady> I would like index to always return a StrPos, but it would be nice if the bare StrPos was false

[19:00] <audreyt> ?eval ?Int

[19:00] <TimToady> it's currently true

[19:00] <evalbot_r15509> Bool::False

[19:00] <TimToady> odd

[19:00] <audreyt> a bare anything is already false

[19:00] <TimToady> was true here

[19:00] <audreyt> as well as undefined

[19:01] <TimToady> ?eval say true Int

[19:01] <evalbot_r15509> OUTPUT[‚ê§] Bool::True

[19:01] <TimToady> okay, misread the return

[19:01] <audreyt> :D

[19:01] <fglock> how about to return a Match object

[19:01] <TimToady> good. changing to always return StrPos, which can be false

[19:01] <audreyt> so StrPos of 0 is true

[19:01] <audreyt> ?

[19:01] <TimToady> yes

[19:01] <TimToady> but you should not be thinking of them as integers, grr!!!

[19:02] <audreyt> ok, that makes a lot more sense than 0/undef.

[19:02] <audreyt> sure.

[19:02] <TimToady> Match seems like overkill

[19:02] <PerlJam> I'd thought that bare "types" were our typed-undef constructors and should be false anyway

[19:03] <TimToady> as long as we get a good message if you use an undefined StrPos, I'm happy

[19:03] <audreyt> that is correct.

[19:03] <audreyt> undefined StrPos numifies to Error, I'd expect

[19:03] <audreyt> or rather, Failure.

[19:04] <audreyt> I would rather undefined Int numify to Failure too...

[19:04] <audreyt> but undefined Str stringify to "Str" ;)

[19:04] <gaal> audreyt: okay, the library topsort (of course) doesn't deal with cycles. it uses reverse postorder of dfs, as far as i can see simply giving wrong output if the graph has cycles

[19:04] <audreyt> gaal: ok...

[19:05] <gaal> so we need to implement something ourselves

[19:05] <audreyt> sad :/

[19:05] <gaal> that unifies items into an, uh, isoset to invent a term, as they are discovered to be cyclical

[19:06] <fglock> dmq: ping?

[19:07] <gaal> is big-O important here at all? how many sigs do we have in the candidate set?

[19:07] <svnbot6> r15510 | lwall++ | Just the definition of index flapping in the breeze...

[19:07] <audreyt> well, we do that all the time :)

[19:07] <audreyt> but we can memoize the decisions

[19:08] <gaal> sure, but it may be one of those things where complexity is dwarfed by concrete implementation

[19:08] <audreyt> sure, so maybe just brute force something

[19:08] <audreyt> I can think of plenty of O(n^2) algorithms...

[19:08] <gaal> not that I'm 100% clear on how to do that yet

[19:10] <fglock> audreyt: re plan to use ropes - how does this affects pugs using p5strings/regexes

[19:13] <audreyt> fglock: not at all

[19:13] <TimToady> the problem with going to Tahiti by constraints is that most people just want to say "Take me to Tahiti" most of the time.  It's the brandname as a shortcut for thought problem, basically, but there are times when named equivalence is just a heck of a lot easier than structural.

[19:15] <gaal> TimToady: but task a C programmer with writing a doubling function, and he'll just assume it's on ints, most of the time

[19:16] <gaal> because int is a bogus brandname for number

[19:17] <gaal> or, and I know you like this one, sleep(42.5)

[19:17] <TimToady> you'll notice I was shifting the blame to the user again. :)

[19:18] <ajs_> Dunno if this was said, but with respect to the "no dups of a given adverb" discussion, above, what about overriding an expanded capture? eg:

[19:18] <ajs_> foo(|($c), :x<1>) # my capture-expanding syntax might be wrong

[19:19] <ajs_> Does that fail if :x is given in $c?

[19:19] <TimToady> good question, at the moment I think it's defined to turn the x arg into a list of values

[19:19] <TimToady> but that's maybe not what was intended 

[19:19] <audreyt> actually, a hypothetical list

[19:19] <gaal> audreyt: this really looks O(n^more than 2) to me; consider that a cycle may in fact play together with other nodes in another cycle

[19:20] <audreyt> if @x is at the receiving end it gets the list

[19:20] <TimToady> oh, right, that's how we handled it

[19:20] <TimToady> nevermind

[19:20] <audreyt> otherwise it gets last

[19:20] <audreyt> S06:454

[19:20] <audreyt> <- was just implementing that very part :)

[19:20] <ajs_> coolness

[19:20] <PerlJam> sounds sane to me.

[19:20] <TimToady> and here I thought you were just smart.

[19:21] <audreyt> :)

[19:21] <TimToady> shifting the blame to the implementor...

[19:21] <PerlJam> It probably helps to have an eidetic memory  :)

[19:21] <TimToady> my wife has one of those, but it's singularly unhelpful with geographical problems unless she's been looking at a map.

[19:22] <audreyt> gaal: true. to run the comparisons is n^2

[19:22] <gaal> there's only so many maps...

[19:22] <audreyt> what, you mean there are only finite worlds?

[19:23] <gaal> there are certainly unmapped worlds...

[19:23] <PerlJam> audreyt: no, we've only generated a finite number of 2d representations.

[19:23] <audreyt> but I thought each world is a map of itself...

[19:23] <audreyt> ...never mind :)

[19:24] <TimToady> gaal: you're confusing the map function with the data territory

[19:24] * gaal greps for his map of puns

[19:24] <ajs_> domain and codomain confusion? Quite common

[19:25] *** CardinalNumber joined
[19:25] <TimToady> map is the shortname, but map:of<Italy>:in<1492> is a longer name...

[19:26] <gaal> that would make for some interesting detours in a trip...

[19:27] <gaal> old enough, and you don't get the Himalayas

[19:28] <gaal> (I bet your maps of Italy don't have the Himalayas...)

[19:29] <TimToady> just returns a MapPos that is false

[19:29] <audreyt> ok, rerunning smokes to see if we stil fail 99% of it...

[19:30] <gaal> audreyt: are all Sigs comparable to each other, necessarily?

[19:31] <gaal> and doesn't the comparison have to take place under context of the present capture?

[19:31] <audreyt> gaal: sure, we assume that f already closes over the capture

[19:31] <audreyt> which is why it's not (Ord Sig) => 

[19:31] <gaal> oh ok...

[19:32] <wolverian> where do the cycles come from?

[19:32] <gaal> outer space?

[19:33] <gaal> I remember spinclad and putter discussing zombies when figuring out multi dispatch

[19:33] <gaal> it was kinda scary!

[19:33] <audreyt> well, strictly speaking, there are ties, but I'm not sure there are cycles

[19:33] <wolverian> hm, that'd make for fun error messages... "Error: Too many zombies from outer space"

[19:34] <gaal> you call that working? /me rushes to add a global &moose...

[19:35] <audreyt> lol

[19:35] <obra> if gaal gets &moose, I demand &squirrel

[19:35] * moritz wants &beaver ;)

[19:36] <audreyt> obra: I didn't know that you're fond of squirrels...

[19:36] <mugwump> phiker: hello

[19:36] <[particle]> i reserve &parrot

[19:36] <phiker> mugwump, I saw that there has been a recent update of cpan6.org

[19:36] <phiker> and the "contribute"-link was removed

[19:37] * kolibrie claims &hummingbird

[19:37] <phiker> so there¬¥s some work going on again?

[19:37] <phiker> (and the sponsors list was added)

[19:37] <moritz> it seems they are finished, no need for more contributors ;-)

[19:38] <Debolaz> Ah crap, if I try to install pugs multiple times it'll ignore the files already installed and there's no uninstall so I have to remove all files manually from all the various directories in order to produce a usefull install paste..

[19:38] <gaal> but really then: what scenario is the spec conceiving in which there are cycles?

[19:39] <Debolaz> Well, at least it seems that /lib/perl6 is the sinner anyway, it installs that in the perl 5 prefix rather than the PREFIX that I specified.

[19:39] * allbery_b thinks doing make install on pugs is something of a bad idea until it's released

[19:39] <allbery_b> especially given that INSTALL documents $PREFIX as being b0rked

[19:40] <Debolaz> allbery_b: Yes, but Audrey asked if PREFIX did the right thing above. :-)

[19:40] <moritz> yay, build .debs ;)

[19:40] <obra> audreyt: moose + squirrel.

[19:40] <gaal> and is the ordering assured associative? specifically, is it guaranteed that if x EQ y, and z LT x, that also z LT y?

[19:40] <Debolaz> So I figured I'd give it a spin.

[19:40] <audreyt> obra: ah, got it now.

[19:40] <gaal> allbery_b: I think releasing pugs is a bad idea until somebody fixes the installer :)

[19:41] <mugwump> phiker, markov got some sponsorship for his idea.  I don't know what his plan for managing contributions is now

[19:41] <audreyt> gaal: no, not that.

[19:41] <phiker> so he¬¥ll continue with the xml-schema-stuff?

[19:41] <audreyt> gaal: otherwise we'll just use mergesort

[19:41] <mugwump> I haven't seen any change in direction on that front

[19:42] *** CardinalNumber is now known as ProperNoun

[19:42] <phiker> :(

[19:43] *** Endymion joined
[19:43] <gaal> then how do we correctly infer tie groups? do we have to start with comparing everybody to everybody else? (not very topsort any more)

[19:44] <audreyt> gaal: that was the naive algorithm I mentioned

[19:45] <audreyt> then we get n*(n-1)/2 Ordering and work with them

[19:46] <mugwump> he has written XML::Compile, which apparently does XML Schema validation in pure perl and lets you transform to YAML tidily

[19:46] <gaal> I still don't really get it; in a usual dag of this kind, you have a partial ordering, but if you assume no cycles then relations are associative so long as it's a connected graph. right?

[19:46] <audreyt> if we are clever, and know that in [a,b,c] we have a<>b and a>c, we don't need to calculate b,c

[19:47] <gaal> audreyt: earlier you said we aren't guaranteed associativity?

[19:49] <gaal> which is what I'm not getting. where can cycles show up in the concrete problem?

[19:51] *** thepler joined
[19:53] <audreyt> A:(Str, Int)   B:(Str, Odd)    C:(Int, Str)     with \(Odd, Int)     we have A<>C B>A B<>C

[19:53] <audreyt> if <> is =, then B>A, A=C should gte B>C

[19:53] <audreyt> but it's not =

[19:55] <audreyt> er sorry, \(Int, Odd).

[19:56] <audreyt> assuming Int :>: Odd and both are compatible (can be casted to) Str

[19:56] <fglock> is this supposed to work? pugs -e ' use v5; printf "version is v%vd\n", $^V; '

[19:56] <audreyt> actually, change Str to Object would work too.

[19:56] <fglock> pugs: Printf.printf: bad formatting char v

[19:57] <gaal> uh, we allow v5 in evalbot?

[20:00] <moritz> hi riffraff ;)

[20:00] <gaal> I... never heard of it :(

[20:01] *** dduncan joined
[20:01] <audreyt> so you may be right

[20:01] <audreyt> er, ok :)

[20:01] <audreyt> mugwump++

[20:02] <dduncan> are any of you familiar with a language named Lua?

[20:02] <audreyt> mugwump: you mean 5.002b1g, right?

[20:03] <audreyt> I was wondering if perl had three-part versions before... :)

[20:03] <dduncan> perl sort of had 3 part versions since 5.6.0 at least, if not 5.0.0

[20:03] <mugwump> yes, that's right.  the announcement in the patch was "This is patch.2b1g to perl5.002beta1."

[20:03] <dduncan> or before

[20:03] <mugwump> sure, the SUBVERSION

[20:04] <ayrnieu> man perlhist

[20:04] <ayrnieu> dduncan - yes, why?

[20:05] <dduncan> yesterday I was talking with someone in RL about my DBMS project and they strongly recommended I looked at the Lua language ... apparently a lot of design principles of what I was doing was in that language

[20:06] <dduncan> eg, a metamodel

[20:06] <dduncan> everything being tables, or something

[20:06] <dduncan> so now people have given me comparisons to both Ada and Lua

[20:06] <ayrnieu> Yes.  It's not really an obscure language :-)

[20:07] <[particle]> there's a lua impl on parrot

[20:07] <dduncan> while I had heard the name before, I didn't know anything else about it until yesterday

[20:08] <dduncan> it also occurred to me that there may be considerable overlap between what one can do with Lua's metamodel and Perl 6's, so I almost wondered if Lua was one of the inspirations for Perl 6 design

[20:08] <dduncan> or if there was some common influence on those lines

[20:09] <lambdabot> Title: #41726: [PATCH] make lua fail more gracefully with an exception handler

[20:09] <dduncan> yes, I saw the comment about it being on Parrot

[20:10] <ayrnieu> dduncan - which comment do you mean?

[20:10] <dduncan> [particle]: there's a lua impl on parrot

[20:10] <dduncan> 2 minutes ago

[20:11] <audreyt> hm, only 1000 new failures so far

[20:11] <ayrnieu> ah, you know, not everything said in the channel is directed at you.  You don't have to wierdly acknowledge it like that..

[20:11] <ayrnieu> also, weirdly.

[20:11] <audreyt> I guess I'll have to fix them later. till tomorrow... &

[20:12] <gaal> good night, audreyt

[20:12] * gaal sleeps also

[20:12] <TimToady> night

[20:12] <dduncan> ayrnieu, well it seemed like it was, given the strong coincidence

[20:13] <dduncan> I mention Lua out of the blue, something not usually brought up here, one person says its on Parrot, and someone else shows a ticket that proves the point

[20:13] <ayrnieu> I'm sure that more careful reading can clear things up for you.

[20:13] <dduncan> but no matter, its history now

[20:14] <riffraff> sorry for the dumb question: for foo() -> $a,$b {} (wehre foo returns an array of pairs) should assign both $a and $b, right?

[20:15] <moritz> it should assign a pair to each I guess

[20:16] <riffraff> oh

[20:16] <riffraff> still doesn't work, cause $b comes out undefined

[20:16] <moritz> riffraff: but you should not rely on my p6-"knowledge"

[20:16] <moritz> riffraff: even number of items?

[20:16] <riffraff> well, I still appreciate your help :)

[20:17] <moritz> ?eval for (1 .. 3) -> my $a, $b { print "a: $a; b: $b " }

[20:17] <evalbot_r15509> OUTPUT[a: 1; b: 2 a: 3; b:  ] undef

[20:18] <riffraff> argh

[20:18] <moritz> funny, at home I get "undeclared variable "$b" in the last iteration

[20:19] <[particle]> as a warning?

[20:19] <dduncan> aren't they spelled $^a and $^b or some such now?

[20:19] <riffraff> moritz: same here

[20:19] <dduncan> the special sort variables

[20:20] <riffraff> the special ones don't work with for loops, it seem

[20:20] <moritz> dduncan: not when you explitly declare them with -> 

[20:20] <riffraff> at least on my box

[20:54] <tene> does Perl 6 have arrays of arrays instead of just arrays of references to arrays?

[20:55] <moritz> the latter, I guess

[20:55] <kolibrie> there are no references in Perl 6

[20:55] <moritz> I just use @a = [1, 2], [3, 4]

[20:55] <moritz> and access it via @a[0][1]

[20:56] <tene> ?eval @a = [1..3],[1..3],[1..3]

[20:57] <evalbot_r15509> [[1, 2], [1, 42]]

[20:58] <tene> There are always multidimensional arrays, which I don't think have been implemented yet and have had changing syntax recently.

[20:59] <Juerd> tene: What was formerly called "a reference to an array", is now called "an array", and behaves the same way

[20:59] <[particle]> looks like either we can't figure out deep clone, or it's broken

[21:00] <Juerd> tene: Depending on the sigil, @ or $, the array flattens in list context, or not.

[21:01] <tene> Juerd: 

[21:02] <tene> ?eval $a = 1..3; $b = $a; $b[0]=42; $a

[21:02] <evalbot_r15509> [42, 2, 3]
