[00:05] <Tene> Hmm.  I've got a perl5 library that I'm trying to use that has a function that requires a reference to a scalar.  What to pass to it from p6?

[00:06] <Tene> checks with:  unless defined($var_ref) && ref($var_ref) eq "SCALAR";

[00:08] <TimToady> maybe { use p5; $val = \$var } or some such

[00:08] * Tene tries.

[09:25] <pmurias> what docs should i look at for info about Signatures?

[09:25] <TimToady> grep is my friend.  S02, S03, and S06...

[09:28] <pmurias> using exactly that...

[09:29] <pmurias> := expects a siganture literal on the left side?

[09:29] <pmurias> * signature

[09:29] <TimToady> yes.  you can omit the : after a declarator, and you can omit the parens on a simple var

[09:32] <pmurias> if i store a signature in a var: $sig = :($arg1,$arg2); is there a way to bind to it at runtime

[09:33] <TimToady> sure, as long as you don't expect it to refer to any real variables

[09:33] <TimToady> $capture ~~ $sig does binding and then throws the binding away

[09:34] <TimToady> if you want to do something with the binding you need a lambda with some code

[09:35] *** JarJarBi1ks joined
[09:36] <TimToady> in general we don't do run-time creation of lexicals without a visible literal declaration

[09:37] <pmurias> i was thinking of something like $sig = :($foo);$capture = \($bar);$sig.bind($capture); being equivalent to $foo := $bar

[09:38] <pmurias> i can predeclare my lexicals before

[09:39] <TimToady> well, obviously the engine has to be doing something like that underneath anyway

[09:39] <TimToady> so there's likely a way to make it visible

[09:40] <TimToady> could probably even write $sig = my :($foo) there

[09:41] *** chris2 joined
[09:41] <TimToady> though then we have a discontinuity with expecting $sig = my $foo to return $foo rather than :($foo)

[09:41] <TimToady> if we define my $foo to be sugar for my :($foo)

[09:42] *** Aankh|Clone is now known as Aankhen``

[09:44] <pmurias> is there a list of methods Signatures & Captures have to implement?

[09:45] <TimToady> sigs have to implement .ACCEPTS to do pattern matching

[09:46] *** moritz left
[09:46] <TimToady> captures have to implement $(), @(), %()

[09:46] *** moritz joined

[09:59] <TimToady> &() might return a block that came in adverbially as :{}

[10:01] <TimToady> and a rubyesque grammar tweak might grab the implicit block that way

[10:04] <pmurias> anything in the synopses about it?

[10:05] <TimToady> not about implicit blocks.  they're always explicit with :{} in p6

[10:06] <TimToady> S06:724 talks about binding slurpy blocks, which is how we currently bind :{}

[10:07] *** rindolf joined
[10:08] *** Aankhen`` left
[10:08] <pmurias> i see

[10:09] <TimToady> so it could well be that *& binds to the &() returned by the capture

[10:10] * pmurias nods ;)

[10:11] <wolverian> TimToady, hey, not sure if you saw my question, but: can you hyper ,? i.e. (@_ »,» 'a') to make @_.elems pairs with 'a' added to each. 

[10:12] <TimToady> presumably

[10:12] <wolverian> ah, great.

[10:13] <wolverian> I was not sure how first level , would be :)

[10:13] <wolverian> &infix:<,> I suppose.

[10:13] <TimToady> it's there notionally even if the parser doesn't really use it

[10:14] <wolverian> right

[10:14] <TimToady> not sure we should tell people that ,= means push  :)

[10:14] <wolverian> I am happy now.

[10:14] <wolverian> har. why not?

[10:14] <TimToady> hard to distinguish from .=

[10:15] <wolverian> true

[10:17] <pmurias> (c++)--

[10:17] <TimToady> purposefully.  it's a rather heavyweight operator

[10:18] <wolverian> yup.

[13:06] <_moritz_> szbalint: because it contains the complete repository, meaning all changesets and logs

[13:07] <szbalint> Yes I know, but compared to svn?

[13:13] <szbalint> What I mean is that the git repository for the linux kernel is 308Mb for 2.6.21

[13:14] <szbalint> so I'm just wondering how comes the pugscode repo convert is twice as big :)

[13:15] <_moritz_> are you talking about .git/ only, or the other contents as well?

[13:15] <_moritz_> linux-2.6.22.1 is 303MB _without_ the history

[13:15] <_moritz_> uncompressed

[13:16] <szbalint> yes

[13:26] <_moritz_> yes, that's the 723MB

[13:27] *** diakopter joined
[13:28] <szbalint> and by repository I mean the data that after transfer over the network allows another repository to be setup

[13:28] <_moritz_> do you know how long that history dates back?

[13:39] <chris2> how did you pack the repository?

[13:39] <chris2> i se

[13:40] <chris2> try git-repack --window=50 --depth=50

[13:40] <chris2> that takes a bit longer, but will back a lot better

[13:40] <_moritz_> chris2: thanks, I'll try that

[13:40] <_moritz_> Generating pack...

[13:40] <_moritz_> Done counting 0 objects.

[13:40] <_moritz_> Nothing new to pack.

[13:41] <chris2> git-repack -a --window=50 --depth=50

[13:42] <_moritz_> aye, that seems to work

[13:43] <chris2> accesses to the repo will be a bit slower then, but it's great for historic archives

[13:44] <_moritz_> anything faster than SVN is a win ;)

[13:45] <_moritz_> how do I publish a git repo? 

[13:45] <chris2> which mechanism?

[13:45] <chris2> http, git, ssh?

[13:45] <_moritz_> I have http available, so that would be easiest I assume

[13:46] <chris2> then you just need to upload it

[13:46] <_moritz_> is the .git dir enough, or do I need to include the actual source files in the repository?

[13:46] <chris2> .git is enough

[13:47] <_moritz_> wow, that command reduced the size of .git to 45MB ;)

[13:47] <_moritz_> chris2++

[13:47] <chris2> yeah

[13:47] <chris2> i compressed YARV to 17mb

[13:47] <chris2> which was less than a SVN checkout(!)

[13:47] <_moritz_> and I assume .git is compressed already, so no need to run it through tar -j ?

[16:36] <bloonix> with every piece I learn p6 I'm amazed a bit more!

[16:36] *** JarJarBi1ks is now known as JarJarBinks

[16:37] <masak> bloonix: yes, that's a positive side effect of p6 being great :)

[16:42] <bloonix> hmmm

[16:42] <bloonix> foo(%h1, %h2, %h3)

[16:42] <bloonix> now I want that foo() take all in one hash

[16:42] <bloonix> how can I do it?

[16:43] <masak> I think it does

[16:43] <bloonix> sub (%h1, %h2, %h3) {} works but I want it all in %h_all

[16:43] <bloonix> sub foo (%h1, %h2, %h3) {}

[16:43] <bloonix> sry

[16:43] <masak> then write sub (%h_all) {}

[16:44] <masak> right, sub foo (%h_all) {}

[16:44] <masak> I think that should be enough

[16:44] <bloonix> *** No compatible multi variant found: "&bar"

[16:44] <masak> the comma operator flattens by default in Perl

[16:44] <masak> bloonix: though whether it's implemented or not, I don't know :)

[16:45] <masak> check the tests

[16:48] <bloonix> ?eval sub foo (%h1, %h2) {%h1<foo>.say;%h2<bar>.say;}; foo({foo => 1}, {bar => 2});

[16:48] <evalbot_r17041> OUTPUT[1␤2␤] Bool::True

[16:49] <bloonix> what happends there intern? I pass references but then it are hashes

[16:49] <bloonix> are that copies?

[16:49] <masak> bloonix: p6 does away with references

[16:49] <masak> in some way, a hash and a reference to it is the same thing

[16:50] <bloonix> *arg* you are right

[16:50] <bloonix> if I want a copy I have to say to make a copy

[16:50] <bloonix> is a copy

[16:50] <bloonix> is copy

[16:50] *** falesca left
[16:52] <masak> bloonix: I can't get it to work either with the hash flattening

[16:52] <masak> either I'm wrong or pugs is wrong

[16:52] <masak> there's something called slurpy arrays though

[16:52] <masak> I never learned exactly what they do, but they are related to this

[16:53] <masak> someone more knowledgeable will be able to answer more fully

[16:53] <masak> meanwhile, I punt to S06

[20:46] <diakopter> hmmm

[20:47] <dduncan> I get the impression that the svn server may be down

[20:47] <diakopter> yeah... 

[20:48] <dduncan> who manages that right now?

[20:48] <diakopter> Juerd

[20:57] <diakopter> I'm guessing an autobuild/autosmoke is occuring.... :)

[20:58] <Juerd> The load was over 80

[20:59] <specbot6> Running for 2154214 seconds.

[20:59] <szbalint> not really healthy

[20:59] <Juerd> Whatever happened is now over

[21:00] *** drupek12 left
[21:00] <Juerd> Someones ghc consumed all memory.

[21:00] <wolverian> thanks :)

[21:00] <Juerd> I did nothing but wait

[21:01] <dduncan> but now it's working at least

[21:02] <pugs_svnbot> r17108 | Darren_Duncan++ | ext/Muldis-DB/ : updated most file contents to say ::Literal rather than ::AST ; also removed the Lit suffix from the Bool|Order|Int|Blob|Text class names

[21:02] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/17108

[21:02] <wolverian> hm. I get pretty bad lag

[21:02] <wolverian> but it might be local

[21:08] <dduncan> Juerd, now Trac has an error citing database locked

[21:08] *** miyagawa left
[21:08] <diakopter> dduncan: it does that... sqlite3 has no concurrency in this case.

[21:08] <dduncan> however, svn/svk client stuff works, since 17108 came through

[21:09] <dduncan> is that all it is?

[21:09] <diakopter> that it uses to authenticate, yeah

[21:09] <dduncan> I never encountered that one before

[21:09] *** thorat joined
[21:09] *** miyagawa joined
[21:09] <diakopter> er, not authenticate.  authorize.

[21:09] <diakopter> just wait a minute; should work soon.
