[17:51] <bloonix> thats confusing

[17:53] <moritz_> it is indeed

[17:54] <bloonix> if I do $foo = $0 first and do $foo.split(rx/\s+/) its the same

[17:54] <moritz_> I think it's somehow because $0 is not a string

[17:55] <moritz_> try (~$0) instead, and it works as expected

[17:55] <moritz_> but that's not very DWIMmy

[17:57] <bloonix> that works but tell me why

[17:57] <bloonix> I dont understand it

[17:57] <bloonix> shouldn't $0 work?

[17:58] <moritz_> wour List multi method split ( Str $input: Str $delimiter, Int $limit = * ) is export our List multi method split ( Str $input: Rule $delimiter, Int $limit = * ) is export

[17:59] <moritz_> if it

[17:59] <moritz_> sorry

[17:59] <moritz_> seems to be a typing problem

[17:59] <moritz_> pugs doesn't implement types very well (which should be changed by audreyt++'s waiting MO branch)

[18:00] <moritz_> it doesn't handle $0 as a string, even though it probably should coerce it into a string

[19:04] <Limbic_Region> today I was teaching an introduction to perl to a bunch of Java developers.  Every so often I would say, in Perl 6 this will be done as "X" or when a question would arise, I would answer the question and say, in Perl 6 this will be done like "Y"

[19:05] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: heh.

[19:05] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: isn't it a bit confusing?

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> The most overwhelming response I got was - when is Perl 6 coming out

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> hrm - apparently this client is eating everything I am typing again

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> The most overwhelming response I got was - when is Perl 6 coming out

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> grrrr

[19:06] <diakopter> Limbic_Region: <sigh>: here, reconnect in 5 minutes - lemme switch it back to use the perl version... oka?

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - not really since this was more a "concepts" class rather than syntax

[19:07] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - don't worry about it

[19:07] <diakopter> ok

[19:10] *** Blwood_ is now known as Blwood

[19:12] *** dduncan left
[19:15] <diakopter> Limbic_Region: oh (nor I, during the brief times I tested it)

[19:15] <TimToady> I'm trying to decide whether <foo: I am a $x> should default to interpolating like "" or not...

[19:16] <TimToady> I find myself want to write a lot of error messages with <panic: ...> that want to interpolate bits of what was already parsed...

[19:16] <TimToady> and S05 doesn't specify what it means by "string" there.

[19:18] <Limbic_Region> remind me what the advantage (in this case) of <panic: ...> is over "panic: ..." ?

[19:18] <[particle]> it's certainly difficult to produce good error messages in the parser now

[19:18] <[particle]> however you can provide a backtrace

[19:18] <[particle]> that helps give some context

[19:20] <TimToady> Limbic_Region: "panic: ..." would match that literally in a regex, whereas <panic: ...> is short for <panic('...')> or maybe <panic("...")>

[19:20] <Limbic_Region> er um, I guess I didn't do a good job of asking my question

[19:21] <TimToady> the : form is just sugar

[19:21] <TimToady> saves wear and tear on the () keys

[19:21] <Limbic_Region> and now I must wait and hope my client delivers the message

[19:21] <Limbic_Region> I guess it wasn't clear from your statement of "write a lot of error messages" that you needed a rule at all

[19:21] <[particle]> so, there's not enough sugar to distinguish between interp and non-interp

[19:21] <Limbic_Region> neat, they came in out of order

[19:22] <TimToady> in particular, I'm trying to redirect bogus uses of old $@ and $# and such to the new things

[19:23] <TimToady> and I find I want the <panic: ...> forms to work both ways.  :/

[19:23] <TimToady> so *probably* I should leave it at single quotes and make me use panic("...") when I really want to interpolate

[19:23] <[particle]> perhaps it's best to use the desugared form

[19:24] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - oh nevermind - I was tripping over the word "write" - you meant write code and I was thinking the actual error message itself

[19:24] <TimToady> on the theory that more complicate things should look more complicated

[19:24] * Limbic_Region really needs a break 

[19:24] <[particle]> more common things should be easier, though

[19:24] <TimToady> yeah, that's the flip side

[19:24] <diakopter> TimToady: what about <panic:"oops: $interpMe">

[19:25] <Limbic_Region> When you put in your 40 before Wednesday it makes for a long week

[19:25] <TimToady> well, if it was unintended, then you likely get a compile-time error

[19:25] * Limbic_Region gives up

[19:25] <Limbic_Region> When you put in your 40 before Wednesday it makes for a long week

[19:25] <diakopter> Limbic_Region: I suspect all your sent messages are getting here; but they're delayed

[19:26] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - well, they may be getting to feather but they are not all getting to irc 

[19:27] <diakopter> oh. it's possible they're getting to us but not to you, however. did you verify against moritz' log? (sorry to question your analysis)

[19:27] <Limbic_Region> I typed the line about 40 about 5 times (2nd time being written)

[19:28] <Limbic_Region> how many times did you see the above line? (2nd time being written)

[19:29] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - I am looking at the logs now, many of the things I type never show up in IRC (2nd time being written)

[19:36] *** Limbic_Region left
[19:40] <TimToady> I suppose, given that panic is essentially a method call, that it makes sense to use colon the same way

[19:44] <[particle]> meaning, that panic is the invocant?

[19:44] <diakopter> panic is sorta like catch

[19:45] <diakopter> ^ (thinking out loud - not answering [particle])

[19:46] *** Jamtech joined
[19:48] <TimToady> panic is the method name; the invocant is implicitly the current match context

[19:49] <TimToady> anyway, that argues for <panic: "foo"> as the proper alterative to <panic("foo")>

[19:50] *** buetow left
[19:50] *** buetow joined
[19:51] <[particle]> and leaves open the possibility for <panic: :message<foo> :exitcode<255>> ?

[19:51] <[particle]> i'm just wondering how much like method calls this will end up being

[19:51] <[particle]> named optional slurpy etc

[19:53] <diakopter> shouldn't a method call be <.panic: ...> for clarity? alternately asked, will the invocant always be the matchee?

[19:53] <TimToady> it's exactly like, except the terminator is >, and the invocant is missing

[19:53] <[particle]> <> implies $/ as invocant

[19:54] <[particle]> except i guess that's not the case with <foo bar>

[19:54] <[particle]> foo is still a method on $/, but bar is a regex
