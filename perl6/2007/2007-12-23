[01:17] <hutrecht> jjore-m: do you think perl is strong enough to make the new regex the new standard regex?

[01:18] <hutrecht> jjore-m: (to be adopted by other languages)

[01:18] <jjore-m> uh, how about you see what happens later?

[01:18] <hutrecht> jjore-m: i can't wait

[01:18] <hutrecht> jjore-m: i'm curious

[01:19] <hutrecht> jjore-m: the new regex looks very powerful

[01:19] <hutrecht> jjore-m: it looks revolutionary

[01:19] <hutrecht> jjore-m: i hope it will become a new standard

[01:19] <jjore-m> ok, see p5p with the future.pm module.

[01:19] <jjore-m> you need a time machine.

[01:20] <hutrecht> what is p5p?

[01:20] <jjore-m> it's the group that produces perl 5.

[01:20] <jjore-m> you know, like 5.10.0 of just a few days ago?

[01:21] <hutrecht> probably you're speaking like this because you're not much familiar with the new regex language promised for perl6

[01:21] <hutrecht> it is quite an improvement, believe me

[01:21] <jjore-m> say hutrecht, you've seen parser generators right?

[01:21] <hutrecht> jjore-m: yes, i have

[01:21] <hutrecht> jjore-m: why?

[01:22] <jjore-m> roughly the new thing looks to me like another powerful parser generator.

[01:22] <hutrecht> jjore-m: yes, but it is still regex

[01:23] <jjore-m> it doesn't appear revolutionary to me but does seem to take the state of the common implementation farther. you know, evolutionary.

[01:23] <hutrecht> then call it abrupt evolution

[01:23] <jjore-m> er?

[01:23] <hutrecht> because regex hasn't evolved much in the past many years

[01:24] <jjore-m> say, do you know a pattern language for tree matching other than XPath?

[01:24] <hutrecht> not really

[15:23] <pugs_svn> r19240 | ruoso++ | [yap6] Some detailed documentation in README (worth looking), and NEW in the prototype.

[15:25] <ruoso> pmurias, please take a look at the new REAME I just commited...

[15:25] <ruoso> I would appreciate an opinion on that

[15:30] <pmurias> ruoso: looking

[15:31] *** aindilis joined
[15:35] <pugs_svn> r19241 | pmurias++ | [yap6] minor english corrections

[15:36] <pmurias> ruoso: the plan is to implement a interpreter in stage 1 perl6?

[15:36] <ruoso> yep...

[15:36] <ruoso> and do that by extending kp6

[15:37] <Alias_> To create skmp6?

[15:37] <Alias_> sorta-kinda-maybe Perl 6?

[15:38] <ruoso> heh

[15:38] <ruoso> actually, it would be KP6 

[15:38] <ruoso> as it is today

[15:38] <ruoso> I mean

[15:38] <ruoso> not

[15:38] <ruoso> that would be the final interpreter

[15:38] *** blindfish left
[15:38] <ruoso> the stage 1 would be more like what mini perl 6 is

[15:39] <ruoso> exept that it would only have available the native types created by yap6

[15:39] <pmurias> ruoso: what will kp6 generate opcodes for yap6 or c code?

[15:40] <ruoso> stage 1 would generate c

[15:40] <ruoso> kp6 would interpret perl code

[15:41] <ruoso> eventually freezing the interpreter state after compilation

[15:41] <ruoso> having a "bytecode-like" data to load

[15:42] <pmurias> ruoso: the way perl5 does?

[15:42] <ruoso> yep

[15:42] <ruoso> much like it

[15:42] <pmurias> ruoso: you could expand a bit on that part in the README

[15:43] <pmurias> my first impresion was that stage 2 would also be c code

[15:44] <pmurias> and only the last sentence suggests that it is otherwise

[15:45] <pmurias> why isn't stage 2 also c code?

[15:45] <ruoso> because the runtime would need to implement a lot of things

[15:45] <ruoso> like exception model

[15:45] <ruoso> stack management

[15:46] <ruoso> but

[15:46] <ruoso> in fact, it is possible to translate it to C

[15:46] <ruoso> even with the optimizations

[15:47] <ruoso> actually... I don't have the stage 2 completely clear right now, 

[15:47] <ruoso> as stage 1 is not implemented yet

[15:47] *** araujo left
[15:47] <ruoso> KP6 today depends a lot in P5

[15:48] <ruoso> the stage 1 needs to implement all that...

[15:48] <ruoso> exception model, closures etc

[15:48] <ruoso> I will only be able to say if stage 2 can or cannot be compiled down to C after stage 1 is implemented

[15:48] <ruoso> but the natural way would be to work just like p5

[15:49] <pmurias> it would avoid needing a c compiler for eval

[15:49] *** Alias_ left
[15:49] <ruoso> yep... but allowing c compilation would provide JIT compilation for code snippets

[15:50] <ruoso> I think we'll have something in between

[15:51] <pmurias> ruoso: i changed the "At first it will be C code" to "Firstly..."

[15:51] <ruoso> I saw it...

[15:51] <pugs_svn> r19242 | ruoso++ | [yap6] some more details about stage 2 in README

[15:51] <pmurias> is the change correct?

[15:52] <ruoso> I'm not sure

[15:52] <ruoso> I just spitted the text... without much worry :) any fix is welcome

[15:53] * ruoso lunch &

[15:54] <pmurias> ruoso: i mean is it planed to be something other then C later on?
