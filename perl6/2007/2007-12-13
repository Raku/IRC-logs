[16:20] *** pmichaud joined
[16:20] <[particle]> hey pm

[16:20] <pmichaud> as the old american indians were reported to say, "HOW."

[16:20] <moritz_> ;)

[16:20] <fglock> pmichaud: hi!

[16:21] <pmichaud> nqp doesn't support .HOW at the moment -- it treats it as a method call on an object

[16:21] <pmichaud> so, if the object knows how to .HOW, then .HOW works :-)

[16:21] *** njbartlett_ joined
[16:22] <[particle]> i couldn't figure out how to create a builtin method like .HOW

[16:22] <pmichaud> well, because it should belong to the destination object

[16:22] <fglock> there is a trick we use in MiniPerl6,

[16:22] <[particle]> 1.HOW should work

[16:22] <fglock> you can define a subroutine that returns the MetaClass object

[16:22] <pmichaud> and besides, NQP tries to avoid builtin functions as much as possible -- the point is to not have a runtime

[16:22] *** kanru joined
[16:23] <pmichaud> or, at least, to not have a runtime beyond what Parrot already provides

[16:23] <[particle]> right, i was wondering how to do HOW without a runtime

[16:23] <fglock> so you can add methods to it

[16:23] <pmichaud> in Parrot it's a bit tricky to add methods to the built-in types

[16:24] <[particle]> is it? you should be able to do it through the PMCProxy

[16:24] <pmichaud> "add_method" on a PMCProxy class doesnt work.

[16:24] <fglock> pmichaud: do you think it makes sense to write the object system over nqp, and ignore the Parrot OO?

[16:24] <pmichaud> (I know, I tried it)

[16:24] <fglock> (that's what kp6-perl5 does)

[16:25] <pmichaud> fglock:  writing the object system over nqp might work, although nqp was never designed for that

[16:25] <fglock> it's slow :(

[16:25] <pmichaud> oh the other hand, I did manage to implement .HOW in perl6 last night :-)

[16:25] <moritz_> fglock: I think there's no real point in doing that, because parrots object model has all we need

[16:25] <moritz_> fglock: it's just not all accessible from within nqp

[16:25] <fglock> pmichaud: how did you do it?

[16:25] <[particle]> sure, but perl6 has a big runtime

[16:26] <[particle]> .HOW? how! :)

[16:26] <pmichaud> fglock:  with lots of smoke and mirrors, unfortunately.  :-)

[16:26] <fglock> does it make sense to write a new Perl 6 PMCs?

[16:26] <pmichaud> but before going too far in that... particle pasted the code

[16:27] <pmichaud> 16:18 <particle> my $v := 1;

[16:27] <pmichaud> 16:18 <particle> my $int := $v.HOW();

[16:27] <pmichaud> 16:18 <particle> say('# Int = ', $int);

[16:27] <pmichaud> and I'm not sure why one would be printing the metaclass object

[16:27] <fglock> pmichaud: that's just to be sure it works correctly, 

[16:28] <fglock> i need it to add new classes/methods

[16:28] <pmurias> fglock: is it possible to call a method which name is contained in $name in kp6?

[16:29] <moritz_> kp6: sub foo { say "foo" }; my $b = "foo"; $b.()

[16:29] <fglock> pmurias: I think you need to add the method to a class

[16:29] <exp_evalbot> r19209: OUTPUT[no method 'APPLY' in Class 'Str'␤ at compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MOP.pm line 345␤  KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::MOP::__ANON__('HASH(0x8e73f30)', 'APPLY') called at compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MOP.pm line 169␤     

[16:29] <exp_evalbot> ..main::DISPATCH('HASH(0x8e73f30)', 'APPLY') called at compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/Kinda...

[16:29] <fglock> ah

[16:29] <pmichaud> if it were me, I'd write up a quick .pir file for kp6 that adds the .HOW methods into the Parrot builtins

[16:29] <pmurias> fglock: i want to write a nqp compatible .perl in kp6

[16:30] <pmichaud> that seems a lot easier than writing up a bunch of new PMCs.  And that's effectively what I'm doing in perl6

[16:30] <pmichaud> For example, in 16:18 <particle> my $v := 1;

[16:30] <pmichaud> oops

[16:30] <pmichaud> wrong past

[16:30] <pmichaud> 16:18 <particle> my $int := $v.HOW();

[16:30] <[particle]> pmichaud: an .include file? that seems easy enough

[16:30] <pmichaud> 16:18 <particle> say('# Int = ', $int);

[16:30] <pmichaud> paste

[16:30] <pmichaud> http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/classes/Object.pir

[16:30] <pmichaud> that's the code that is implementing WHAT, HOW, isa, etc for Perl 6's basic types.  It's also handling things like the fact that Parrot's 'String' should be a Perl 6 'Str'

[16:30] <fglock> pmurias: .perl should be supported by Parrot

[16:31] <[particle]> how does .perl work?

[16:31] <[particle]> can you evalbot a sample?

[16:32] <moritz_> pugs: say <foo bar>.perl

[16:32] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[("foo", "bar")␤]

[16:32] <[particle]> so, it desugars?

[16:32] <moritz_> .perl is Perl6's builtin Data::Dumper 

[16:32] <pmichaud> .perl is intended to generated code that when evaled would recreate the structure

[16:32] <[particle]> gotcha

[16:32] <moritz_> it can sugar and desugar as it likes ;)

[16:33] <pmichaud> in S02, starting with "To get a Perlish representation of any object, ... "

[16:36] *** njbartlett left
[16:37] <fglock> i'm still balancing our options,

[16:37] <fglock> what if kp6 compiled directly to pir 

[16:37] <moritz_> what's the advantage of pir compared to PAST?

[16:37] <fglock> we have PAST, PIR, and nqp; I assume it doesn't make sense to compile to perl6

[16:38] <moritz_> agreed

[16:38] <fglock> moritz_: pir gives more access to low level workings

[16:38] *** penk joined
[16:39] <moritz_> fglock: ok, good point

[16:39] <[particle]> fglock: you can use pir inline in nqp

[16:39] <pmichaud> also in PAST, for that matter :-)

[16:39] <[particle]> PIR <noop>;

[16:39] <[particle]> true

[16:39] <pmichaud> PIR q<noop>;

[16:39] <pmichaud> (don't forget the 'q')

[16:39] <[particle]> sorry, sticky q key

[16:40] * pmichaud hands particle a pry bar

[16:40] <[particle]> also 'PIR <<END_OF_PIR;'

[16:40] <pmichaud> PIR  q:to:'END';

[16:40] <[particle]> except, that's spelled....

[16:40] <[particle]> yep

[16:41] <pmichaud> I still owe rdice an article about inline pir in nqp -- maybe I should write that up this morning

[16:42] <fglock> pir inline in nqp looks nice

[16:42] <fglock> but i'd need more details on nqp internals

[16:42] <pmichaud> the article would explain it

[16:43] <pmichaud> but essentially to grab a lexical, one does    q<   $P0 = find_lex '$foo'  >;

[16:43] <pmichaud> to rebind a lexical:    q<   store_lex '$foo', $P0   >

[16:43] <fglock> I could implement assignment using this

[16:44] *** PhileasFox joined
[16:45] <pmichaud> there's not a way in NQP's inline pir to create lexicals -- at least not one that works reliably.

[16:45] <pmichaud> but one can always do:

[16:45] <pmichaud>     my $foo;

[16:46] <pmichaud>     PIR q<   store_lex '$foo', whatever  >;

[16:46] <[particle]> .lex '$foo' won't work?

[16:46] <fglock> in short, use nqp for closures and variable allocation, and use PIR for OO

[16:47] <pmurias> fglock: or we could use PAST for closures and variable allocation, and PIR for OO

[16:48] <pmichaud> depends on what you mean by "PIR for OO"

[16:48] <pmichaud> NQP does OO just fine

[16:48] <pmichaud> it's just Parrot OO

[16:48] <pmichaud> in fact, now that I think about it.

[16:49] <fglock> how is Parrot OO different from Perl 6 OO ?

[16:50] <lambdabot> Title: sial.org Pastebot - pasteling

[16:51] <pmichaud> http://hpaste.org/4433

[16:51] <Khisanth> perlbot needs context aware factoids :)

[16:52] <pmichaud> (Parrot OO versus Perl 6 OO)    Parrot's OO is more class-based, Perl 6 tends to do things with prototypes

[16:52] <pmichaud> also, there's not a top-level base class that subsumes all of the different types of PMCs that could appear

[16:53] <fglock> you mean, we could create a kp6 object hierarchy, which inherits from Parrot basic classes

[16:53] <pmichaud> that's what perl6 is doing, yes.

[16:53] *** penk left
[16:53] <[particle]> yes

[16:53] <[particle]> create an oo runtime lib

[16:53] *** penk joined
[16:53] <fglock> ok

[16:53] <pmichaud> but "hierarchy" is a bit difficult, because there's not a superclass that links, say, 'Integer' and 'String'

[16:54] <[particle]> it'll be faster than the one sitting on perl5, we promise

[16:54] <fglock> I think can we build "Scalar" that way

[16:54] <pmichaud> the other thing to keep in mind is that "object" in Parrot speak has two meanings -- it can either be a PMC type or it can be something implemented using the Object PMC type

[16:55] <fglock> or, is $x already a Scalar?

[16:56] <pmichaud> in nqp, $x is a symbol entry

[16:56] <pmichaud> i.e., it's something in a (lexical) symbol table somewhere

[16:56] <pmichaud> by definition, that entry refers to a PMC of some type.  We don't have Scalar PMCs yet -- just the value types.

[16:56] <fglock> so this part needs some emulation

[16:57] <pmichaud> (and I'm not quite sure how one can implement Scalar with what Parrot has at the moment.)

[16:57] <fglock> kp6 does some tricks with the dispatcher, we could port that to kp6-perrot

[16:57] <fglock> parrot

[16:57] <pmichaud> what sorts of tricks?

[16:58] <fglock> Containers have a separate MetaModel

[16:58] <fglock> that you can access by building a proxy with VAR($x)

[16:58] <pmichaud> right, Parrot doesn't have that yet

[16:58] <fglock> otherwise, you are always accessing the contents

[16:59] <fglock> kp6 compiles $x=2 to: VAR($x).STORE(2)

[16:59] <pmurias> and $x.foo to $x.foo

[17:00] <fglock> yes

[17:00] <pmichaud> what about binding?

[17:00] <pmichaud> $x := $y

[17:00] <fglock> VAR($x).BIND( VAR($y) )

[17:01] <fglock> hmm, no

[17:01] <pmichaud> so, after that $x contains a reference to the $y Scalar?

[17:01] <fglock> VAR($x).BIND($y)

[17:01] <fglock> VAR($y) is called inside .BIND

[17:01] <pmurias> fglock: it's emitted perl5 $x = $y

[17:01] <fglock> no, both contain pointers to a second place

[17:02] <fglock> pmurias: I've changed that, it had problems

[17:02] <pmurias> sorry i'm wrong

[17:02] <pmichaud> and so   VAR($x).STORE(2) causes a 2 to be stored into the place pointed at by $x ?

[17:02] <fglock> they have a "shared cell"

[17:03] <fglock> yes, 2 is stored in an "attribute" in $x

[17:03] <fglock> kind of

[17:03] <pmichaud> and that attribute would be shared with $y if they were bound?

[17:03] <fglock> yes

[17:03] <pmichaud> what about arrays?

[17:04] <fglock> they are more like a list of Scalar

[17:04] <fglock> it behaves the same, regarding VAR(...)

[17:04] <pmichaud> yes, that's where Parrot starts to break down -- Parrot's arrays are list of values

[17:05] <fglock> and @a[1][2][3] returns a Scalar-proxy that will do all the autovivifications if necessary

[17:05] <fglock> that is, if the cell is .BIND or .STOREd

[17:06] <pmichaud> anyway, it starts to get real icky in parrot if every value in an aggregate requires two PMCs (plus the PMC for the aggregate itself)

[17:07] <pmichaud> we might end up having to do that, but so far I've been avoiding it

[17:07] *** Southen joined
[17:08] <fglock> the "cell" could be a C data structure, it doesn't need to be an object

[17:09] <fglock> maybe it already exists anyway

[17:09] <pmichaud> to be visible at the parrot bytecode level, it would need to be a PMC

[17:09] <fglock> it's just a pointer

[17:09] <pmichaud> but it's a pointer that can be referenced

[17:10] <pmichaud> that's essentially what Scalar-proxy is doing

[17:10] <pmichaud> it's creating a reference to a cell in an aggregate

[17:11] <fglock> no, it doesn't do that,

[17:11] <fglock> the cell in the aggregate doesn't exist yet

[17:11] <pmichaud> maybe not physically, but it virtually exists :-)

[17:11] <fglock> it gets vivified on demand

[17:11] <fglock> right

[17:12] <pmichaud> I can reference items that don't exist yet.  That's effectively what '$x' means when it hasn't been instantiated yet :-)

[17:12] <pmichaud> in fact, if one treats the symbol table as a Hash, then all Scalars are actually like "Scalar-proxy"

[17:13] <fglock> exactly

[17:13] <pmichaud> well, we may end up implementing a Scalar PMC class that acts like scalar-proxy

[17:14] <pmichaud> as you already know, the tricky part is knowing when we're working with the value and when we're working with the container

[17:14] <fglock> the VAR() function fixes that

[17:15] <pmichaud> is it a function or a macro?

[17:15] <pmichaud> I mean, it's not a function in the same sense that   foo(2) is a function

[17:15] <pmichaud> it sounds more like a context

[17:16] <fglock> it's implementation dependent; it's a function in kp6-perl5

[17:17] <fglock> it wraps the Scalar, swapping the dispatchers

[17:18] <fglock> a context would work too

[17:19] *** penk left
[17:19] *** penk joined
[17:21] <fglock> so I probably need a few C pmcs for kp6

[17:21] *** Southen_ left
[17:22] <pmichaud> anyway, I have to afk for a bit

[17:22] <fglock> ok, I'll get some coffee :)

[17:35] <fglock__> this is an interesting problem, Parrot wants to give me a full set of tools, but I'm looking for a different set

[17:36] <fglock__> I need to learn more about Parrot

[17:36] *** jisom joined
[17:36] <ispy_> fglock__: different computer?

[17:36] <fglock__> ispy_: lousy internet router

[17:37] <ispy_> fglock__: I just sent a message to your other handle... I'll post here.

[17:37] <ispy_> So really fast a quick background on me.  I've been developing software as a hobby for 4 years, 6 months professionally.  I'm for the most part a Perl5 developer that also dabbles in python, tcl and javascript.  I have NO experience with low level languages or for that matter any complete understanding of pointers so any low-level work you need help with is best left for those who grasp those concepts.  As far as Perl5/6 related assistance, I can confidently 

[17:37] <ispy_> (12:32:47 PM) ispy_: Just wanted you to know what I'm able to bring to the table

[17:37] <pmichaud> fglock__: this is partially why perl6 on Parrot has taken a while.  :-)

[17:38] <fglock__> ispy_: one sec

[17:38] <pmichaud> it's also worth remembering that Parrot is targeting much more than just Perl 6

[17:39] <avar> ispy_: "I can condifently" is where you got cut off

[17:40] <fglock__> ispy_: you can probably learn all you need by following pointers that people will give you here and there

[17:40] <fglock__> ispy_: you don't need to grasp all at once

[17:40] *** TJCRI joined
[17:42] <fglock__> pmichaud: re taken a while, kp6 really needs just a few low level structures, 

[17:42] <fglock__> maybe it's worth implementing them in C?

[17:42] <pmichaud> could be

[17:42] <pmichaud> depends on what they are

[17:42] *** ruoso left
[17:42] <moritz_> that's what ruoso is doing

[17:42] <pugs_svn> r19211 | pmurias++ | [kp6] added .DISPATCH to Object which serves as $foo.$meth

[17:42] <pugs_svn> r19211 | pmurias++ | used in PAST.pm

[17:43] *** jjore-m left
[17:43] <moritz_> is $foo.$meth allowed at all?

[17:43] <moritz_> syntactically, I mean

[17:43] <pmichaud> yes

[17:43] <moritz_> isn't that $meth: $foo; ?

[17:43] *** ruoso joined
[17:44] *** fglock left

[17:45] <ruoso> moritz_, yap6 is almost ready to be a kp6 backend

[17:45] <moritz_> pmichaud: thanks

[17:46] <ruoso> at this moment, the APPLY codes can already be implemented

[17:46] <ruoso> for the native types

[17:46] <ruoso> and the last native types can be implemented also

[17:47] <ispy_> moritz_: Does he have plans to expand the tutorial?

[17:47] <pugs_svn> r19212 | ferreira++ |  r202@dracma:  perl | 2007-12-13 15:46:46 -0200

[17:47] <pugs_svn> r19212 | ferreira++ |  fixed smarlink errors in t/ pointed by "util/smartlinks.pl --check"

[17:47] <ruoso> fglock and I were having a conversation about it at lunch today

[17:47] <moritz_> ispy_: I think he's got no time

[17:47] <ruoso> we're in a point that we can plan a statically typed perl subset that would be used to write the MOP

[17:48] <ispy_> moritz_: should that be continued by someone else?  It has potential to be an excellent resource.

[17:48] <moritz_> ispy_: but I'm sure you can become a coauthor

[17:48] <ruoso> and this language would be compiled by kp6 targetting yap6 runtime

[17:48] <moritz_> (I'm one)

[17:48] <ispy_> moritz_: hmm... I'll ask him next time he's on.

[17:49] <pmurias> ispy_: what tutorial?

[17:49] <ispy_> pmurias: diveintoperl6

[17:49] <ispy_> pmurias: I would like to write an entry on complex data structures

[17:50] <fglock__> otoh, Parrot likely provides great process management tools (gc, stm, light threads), which is nice

[17:50] <ruoso> yep... 

[17:50] <moritz_> @seen thoughtpolice

[17:50] <lambdabot> I saw thoughtpolice leaving #perl6, #haskell and #xmonad 11h 4m 26s ago, and .

[17:50] *** jisom left
[17:50] <ruoso> yap6 doesn't means to compete with parrot in any way

[17:51] <moritz_> ispy_: just @tell him in a message that you'd like to publish one

[17:51] <moritz_> ispy_: lambdabot will deliver it for your

[17:51] <ruoso> yap6 have a stupid refcount gc, uses libc memory management, and relies on pthread.

[17:51] <ruoso> nothing really portable and powerfull

[17:51] <ruoso> but small and simple

[17:52] <ispy_> moritz_: thanks dude... I'll do that now.

[17:52] <fglock__> ruoso: how about converting the yap6 things to Parrot pmcs

[17:53] <ruoso> I wasn't able to get the PMC out of the parrot strucutre

[17:53] <ruoso> it was depending on a much more complex runtime from every side I looked

[17:54] <ispy_> @tell thoughtpolice Hey, I've recently began contributing to Perl6 development.  And learned you were the author of the very site I learned to program in Perl6 from.  moritz_ and I were talking and he mentioned you might give me co-author access so I might expand the tutorial.  I would really like to write a few data structure examples among a few other things.  I really see a lot of additional potential for this blog and would very much like to be apart of t

[17:54] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[17:55] <fglock__> i'm thinking of translating Runtime/Perl5/* to Runtime/PMC/*

[17:55] <fglock__> then we have a "Perl 6 VM"

[17:55] <ruoso> when I tried it, I was only able to do it using PIR...

[17:56] <fglock__> I mean, in C

[17:56] *** pmichaud left
[17:57] *** Limbic_Region left
[18:00] <ruoso> that's what I tried to say by not being able to simplify things

[18:00] <ruoso> I wasn't able to get "a small part" of Parrot

[18:01] <ruoso> I considered that before starting yap6

[18:01] <ruoso> but maybe I just missed the point...

[18:06] *** jjore-m joined
[18:09] *** jferrero joined
[18:10] <fglock__> is it already possible to write pmcs in perl5?

[18:14] <fglock__> rethorical question, sorry

[18:15] <pmurias> swimming&

[18:17] <fglock__> a possible plan would be to write the kp6 object system in C+PIR, and then emit nqp+PIR

[18:24] *** bbkr joined
[18:24] <fglock__> this would possibly result in less performance than the pure PIR version, because PIR is using a simplified model

[18:24] *** rindolf joined
[18:26] <moritz_> is there a good reason not to use plain, pure PIR?

[18:27] <fglock__> moritz_: the semantic level of PIR is that of Perl 5,

[18:28] <fglock__> it should result in the same level of performance

[18:28] <fglock__> same thing for PAST

[18:29] <fglock__> the main reason for changing the development backend is performance

[18:30] <fglock__> unfortunately, performance comes with a huge cost

[18:30] <fglock__> so we need to balance that

[18:30] <fglock__> and do a reality check for premature optimization, for instance

[18:31] <moritz_> fglock__: but with PIR we can use parrot's object system

[18:31] <moritz_> fglock__: which means that the emitted code will be much more concise

[18:31] <fglock__> we can't, really

[18:31] <moritz_> why?

[18:31] <fglock__> it doesn't currently implement the same object semantics that kp6 does

[18:32] <moritz_> in which way?

[18:32] <fglock__> the MetaModel works slightly different, Containers work slightly different

[18:33] <fglock__> the small differences add up 

[18:33] <moritz_> hm, sad

[18:33] <fglock__> of course, we can discuss that on #parrot and fix that

[18:34] *** DarkWolf84 joined
[18:34] *** BinGOs_ joined
[18:34] <moritz_> well, I don't know enough about PIR and about kp6 to comment on it

[18:35] <fglock__> otoh, Parrot is designed for flexibility, and it can support other models

[19:03] <araujo> hi

[19:03] * araujo has glanced over this parrot discussion

[19:03] <moritz_> hi araujo 

[19:03] <araujo> fglock__, does kp6 use parrot?

[19:03] <araujo> hello moritz_ 

[19:03] <moritz_> araujo: not in its default backend

[19:03] <araujo> how that perl6 hacking goes?

[19:07] <fglock__> araujo: kp6 is meant to use Parrot, as soon as possible

[19:07] <moritz_> even before bootstrap?

[19:08] <fglock__> kp6 currently uses a "VM" written in Perl 5

[19:08] <araujo> fglock__, i see

[19:08] <fglock__> moritz_: kp6 is nearly bootstrapped 

[19:08] <fglock__> i'm not sure it makes sense to fix the remaining bugs

[19:09] <moritz_> fglock__: what do you mean by "nearly bootstrapped"? does it pass some of the regular kp6 tests?

[19:10] <fglock__> yes, it passes some of them

[19:10] <fglock__> but it's very slow

[19:10] <ispy_> hey guys, how do I pipe file handles like in p5?

[19:10] <ispy_> :)

[19:11] <moritz_> ispy_: pipe file handles? can you give a short p5 example?

[19:11] <ispy_> open my $cmd, "command |";

[19:11] *** BinGOs left
[19:11] <fglock__> moritz_: the bugs are perl5-vm bugs, not really kp6 bugs

[19:11] <moritz_> fglock__: ok

[19:12] <moritz_> ispy_: not sure.... perhaps it's in S16

[19:12] <moritz_> in case of doubt it's the same as in p5, which would translate to my $cmd = open "command |";

[19:13] <ispy_> moritz_: I tried that, assuming the same as you, it failed in pugs... possibly I'm in error though.  I'll give it a deeper look.

[19:13] <moritz_> ispy_: it could very well just not implemented yet

[19:15] <ispy_> moritz_: man, that totally ruins my plan to prototype this network routing program in p6 :(  

[19:15] <ispy_> moritz_: that's how it goes :)

[19:15] <moritz_> ispy_: I know it's sad, but all p6 implementations are plain weak on I/O

[19:16] <ispy_> moritz_: I can understand why that stuff has taken a potential back-burner, unfortunetly for me the only work I have to do is IO related right now, that's cool... p5 will just have to do it as gracefully as it always has.

[19:17] *** BinGOs joined
[19:17] <fglock__> hmm - v6.pm should handle that

[19:19] <[particle]> look through the pugs test suite for io tests, and see if they pass

[19:23] <fglock__> [particle]: are there Parrot vs. Perl 5 benchmarks?

[19:24] <fglock__> I wonder if kp6-in-PIR will be fast enough

[19:24] <ispy_> [particle]: thank you, I'll look into that.

[19:24] <fglock__> compared to kp6 with C-PMCs
