[07:42] <agentzh> "ls" is a mistake :P

[07:42] <moritz_> I thought so ;)

[07:42] <agentzh> heh

[07:43] <agentzh> just given a talk to my department on XUL::App :)

[07:43] <moritz_> no tuits for the PCR tracer CGI yet - the script works, but the file permissions need fiddling :/

[07:43] <moritz_> cool 

[07:44] <agentzh> moritz_: i'm going to write a  FF extension for it :)

[07:44] <agentzh> let extensions call user's local perl

[07:44] <agentzh> and local PCR

[07:44] <moritz_> YaY

[07:44] <agentzh> so no permission fiddling is needed :)

[07:45] <agentzh> with XUL::App, one can write a FF ext using Perl :)

[07:45] <agentzh> http://agentzh.org/misc/slides/xulapp/xulapp.xul

[07:45] <agentzh> XUL::App will soon be on CPAN :)

[07:46] <moritz_> that slide's killing my firefox :/

[07:47] <agentzh> .........

[07:47] <agentzh> maybe some of your FF extensions hate it ;)

[07:47] <agentzh> one of my friends have similar problems too :)

[07:47] <agentzh> try running your Firefox in safe mode ;)

[07:58] <pantteri> What does " it is a member of package bytestring-0.9.0.1, which is hidden" mean - sorry I know almost nothing about Haskell...

[07:59] <pantteri> How can I make that package visible?

[08:00] <allbery_b> add it to the .cabal file

[08:00] <allbery_b> I imagine a bunch of stuff is broken by the recent spinning off of large chunks of base

[08:01] <pantteri> Hey, I'm newbie here! :) Which .cabal file?

[08:02] * allbery_b cannot chck quickly, the drive with his pugs setup on it is offline atm

[08:03] <pantteri> Or which version of pugs could I try to build? I'm right now just interested to experiment with perl6.

[08:05] <allbery_b> (I will be honest, I haven't been able to build pugs in months, but I've been using various ghc prereleases.  before the big base split, even.)

[08:07] <allbery_b> I *think*, i fyou're using ghc 6.8.1, you will need to edit Pugs.cabal.in and add to the build-depends line, before the __DEPENDS__ token:  collections -any, parallel -any, bytestring -any

[08:07] <allbery_b> at minimum

[08:07] <allbery_b> might be easier to try it with ghc 6.6.1

[08:08] *** Aankhen`` left
[08:08] *** Aankhen`` joined
[08:09] <pantteri> Thanks, I'll try first the .cabal magic.

[08:10] <allbery_b> hm, also:  old-locale -any

[08:10] <allbery_b> and possibly change time -any to old-time -any

[08:10] <allbery_b> the base split broke pretty much every haskell-based package in existence :/

[08:11] <pantteri> What was the base split?

[08:12] <allbery_b> shortly before ghc 6.8.1 was released, a lot of stuff that was in the "base" library collection was separated

[08:13] <allbery_b> so for example lists used t be part of base, but are now in collections (along with sets and seq); arrays are in their own package; bytestring, which had only just been added to base for 6.6, is its own package again

[08:15] <allbery_b> basically if you compile and get a "is in package <foo>, which is hidden", add ", foo -any" to Pugs.cabal.in and start over at perl Makefile.PL

[08:16] <moritz_> ... and commit your changes to the pugs repository ;)

[08:16] <allbery_b> yeh, that too :)

[08:17] <pantteri> OK, I added the packages to Pugs.cabal.in and they even appear in Pugs.cabal but packages are still hidden...

[08:18] <pantteri> I'm sure you will get at least a patch file if I manage to build pugs.

[08:18] <moritz_> pantteri: do you want access to the pugs svn repository?

[08:18] <moritz_> a.k.a. "commit bit"

[08:18] <pantteri> readonly

[08:18] <pantteri> hmm.

[08:18] <pantteri> Not sure :)

[08:19] <moritz_> just /msg me your email address and desired nick name

[08:19] <pantteri> OK. I'll do that if I manage to do anything useful.

[08:20] <moritz_> alright

[08:20] <allbery_b> like I said, if you get new hidden packages, add them to Pugs.cabal.in and start over

[08:20] <moritz_> gotta go, bye #perl6

[08:20] <allbery_b> of you get the *same* packages, then we have something deeper

[08:21] <pantteri> allbery_b: The same packages are still problematic

[08:22] <allbery_b> I wonder if you need to "make distclean" or something

[08:23] <allbery_b> unfortunately I can't check (and should try to go back to bed again...)

[08:28] <pantteri> Distclean did not help either. Thank you for help anyway!

[18:55] <pmurias> i mean document Array in Array.pm rather then in MOP

[18:56] <dlocaus> I see what you mean.. humm

[18:57] *** cmarcelo left
[18:57] <pmurias> i get

[18:57] <pmurias> Unknown arguments to TAP::Harness::new (verbosity) at script/run_tests.pl line 162

[18:57] <pmurias> when i run script/run_tests.pl

[18:57] <dlocaus> pmurias: ok, I'll check ito that.

[18:58] <pmurias> updating TAP::Harness

[18:58] *** andrewns left
[19:00] <dlocaus> 3.02 is out...

[19:01] <dlocaus> how are you invoking the verbose argument?

[19:01] <pmurias> perl script/run_tests.pl --backend=perl5

[19:01] <pmurias> the error didn't disapear

[19:02] <dlocaus> cool :)

[19:03] <dlocaus> pmurias: I'm updating the documentation

[19:03] *** cmarcelo joined
[19:09] <pugs_svn> r18872 | pmurias++ | [kp6] TAP::Parser now uses verbose instead of verbosity

[19:09] *** devogon joined
[19:10] <pmurias> TAP::Harness has inconsitent documentation

[19:14] * pmurias has inconsistent spelling ;)

[19:15] *** BinGOs_ joined
[19:15] <dlocaus> They get to it pretty fast, I made a comment about new ( { exec => [] } ) and they got it.

[19:17] *** devogon left
[19:18] <pmurias> that's good

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18873 | dlo++ | [kp6] Runtime::Perl5::(IO/Gather/List/Array/Hash/Kp6Security/Math/Pair) all called make class with ( parent => [ ... 

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18873 | dlo++ | ] ), when it should have been ( parents => [ ... ] ). Note the 's' on parents.

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18873 | dlo++ | 

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18873 | dlo++ | After this change, all tests still passed.  I have put in a check in MOP.pm that should any arguments come in that 

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18873 | dlo++ | are unrecognized it will drop a warning.

[19:19] <jMCg> Any chance that any of those commits will fix my compile sooner or later ;)

[19:19] *** BinGOs left
[19:20] <pmurias> jMCg: i doubt it?

[19:20] <pmurias> jMCg: you mean your pugs compile

[19:20] <dlocaus> @tell fglock I have updated Runtime::Perl5::(many). FYI.

[19:20] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[19:20] <jMCg> pmurias: yes.

[19:20] <pmurias> kp6 is a seperate implementation in perl5

[19:21] <pmurias> in perl6

[19:21] <pmurias> which compiles to perl5

[19:23] <pmurias> kp6 should work fine even if you don't have haskell at all

[19:26] <pmurias> you can try your luck with kp6 if pugs dosn't work for you

[19:26] <lambdabot> Title: Arity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[19:26] <dlocaus> The things I learn from reading KP6 code

[19:28] <Tene> Perl 6 has a .arity method on code blocks, as I recall.

[19:29] <dlocaus> yeah, but I never heard of that word before

[19:30] <PerlJam> We invent our own vocabulary around here, so it's good to look up stuff you've never heard before  :-)

[19:31] *** BinGOs__ joined
[19:32] <pugs_svn> r18874 | dlo++ | [kp6] Moved the $::Array documentation from Runtime::Perl5::MOP to Runtime::Perl5::Array

[19:39] *** BinGOs left
[19:40] <dlocaus> pmurias: ping?

[19:40] <pmurias> pong looking

[19:40] <dlocaus> Hurmm... "someone" (not naming names here), didn't define parents for a lot of classes

[19:41] <dlocaus> or at least the parent isn't defined as of invocation of make_class

[19:41] <dlocaus> so, I put in a check for make_class, but now when I do a "make" test, it scrambles the "output" by the volume of warning messages.

[19:42] <dlocaus> I think the warning is worth while... but Adding an extra 13 lines to every test case is a bit "ouch"

[19:42] <dlocaus> I believe I should commit the code, but this is going to be a lot of messages.

[19:42] <dlocaus> do you have any thoughts?

[19:43] <dlocaus> Do you want me to commit and then you can see for yourself?

[19:43] <pmurias> you ask too hard questions ;)

[19:44] * dlocaus snickers

[19:44] <dlocaus> pmurias: is that yes?

[19:44] <dlocaus> its an extra 1092 lines...

[19:44] <dlocaus> of "make test" output

[19:44] <dlocaus> moritz_: ping?

[19:45] <pmurias> dlocaus: i'm not even sure every class needs a parent

[19:45] <dlocaus> A parent was defined for this class, and it doesn't exist

[19:46] <dlocaus> parents => [$::meta_Hash],

[19:46] <dlocaus> ah wait

[19:46] <dlocaus> nope, that doesn't exist

[19:47] <pmurias> a warning for undef parent is ok (or even a die)

[19:47] <dlocaus> if someone said that $::meta_Hash is going to be a parent, I think its reasonable to make sure that parent actually is defiend.

[19:47] <dlocaus> I'll do a warning then.

[19:50] <pugs_svn> r18875 | dlo++ | [kp6] I have moved the documentation for $::Hash from Runtime::Perl5::MOP into Hash.pm.  I have also updated the 

[19:50] <pugs_svn> r18875 | dlo++ | Runtime::Perl5::MOP make_class to raise a warning if a parent is passed, but is undefined.  I am sorry about the 

[19:50] <pugs_svn> r18875 | dlo++ | error messages, but this is worthy of a warning.

[19:53] <pmurias> dlocaus: you could fix some of the warnings by changind $meta_something into ::DISPATCH($::something,"HOW")

[19:58] <dlocaus> pmurias: sorry, I had to move my car (street cleaning)

[19:58] <dlocaus> ok

[19:58] <dlocaus> I want to document the other "make_class" items.. then I'll fix the warnings

[20:34] <pugs_svn> r18877 | dlo++ | With pmurias's suggestion, ( http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2007-11-16#i_145763 )

[20:34] <pugs_svn> r18877 | dlo++ | I fixed the parent(s) being undefined and also did minor touch ups on the
