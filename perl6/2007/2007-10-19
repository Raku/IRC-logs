[00:07] <fax> ah cool

[00:07] <fax> hows it going?

[00:07] <avar> well:)

[00:11] <avar> fax: testing is better now, see pugs.blogs.com

[00:13] <fax> cool

[00:16] <avar> fax: want to hack ?:)

[00:16] <fax> I want to try and get kp6-Array :map to work

[00:17] <avar> Yes, I was going to mention that

[00:17] <fax> what about it?

[00:17] <fax> I also must install paredit soon

[00:17] <avar> for that to work arguments to :apply subs need to work, I was trying to hack that in without success yesterday

[00:17] <fax> alright

[00:17] <avar> my $sub = sub { 5 + 5 }; say $sub.() works

[00:18] <avar> my $sub = sub { 5 + 5 }; say $sub.(5) doesn't

[00:18] <avar> the relevant stuff is :apply in Code.lisp

[00:18] <Tene> kp6: my $sub = sub { 5 + 5 }; say $sub.();

[00:18] <exp_evalbot> r18484: OUTPUT[10␤]

[00:19] <avar> I was trying to add the argument list equivalent to say  (5) to it

[00:19] <avar> uh, say(5)

[00:19] <avar> (lag)

[00:19] *** theorb left
[00:19] <avar> if you can get that working with positional and named parameters then :sort, :grep, and everything that takes a sub can be implemented

[01:41] <fax> hey avar,

[01:41] <fax> I might have got 'my $sub = sub { 5 + 5 }; say $sub.(5)' to work (assuming I didn't break something else)

[01:42] <fax> 'my $sub = sub { @_[0] + 5 }; say $sub.(5)' doesn't though (because "Variable (@ . _) does not exist")

[01:43] <fax> (is that @_ doesn't exist expected?)

[01:50] <[particle]> pugs: my $sub = sub { @_[0] + 5 }; say $sub.(5);

[01:50] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[10␤]

[01:50] <[particle]> hrmm... i'm not sure that @_ exists anymore, though.

[01:51] <[particle]> from S06:

[01:51] <[particle]> =head2 Perl5ish subroutine declarations

[01:51] <[particle]> You can declare a sub without parameter list, as in Perl 5:

[01:51] <[particle]>     sub foo {...}

[01:51] <[particle]> Arguments implicitly come in via the C<@_> array, but they are C<readonly>

[01:51] <[particle]> aliases to actual arguments:

[01:51] <[particle]>     sub say { print qq{"@_[]"\n}; }   # args appear in @_

[01:52] *** thoughtpolice left
[01:52] <[particle]> so, the spec expects @_ to exist. kp6 may be missing it

[04:37] <fax> I'm not sure about what $_ and @_ should be in sub though (sub { ... })

[04:37] <fax> is it simply that $_ is @_[0]?

[04:38] <TimToady> in that, @_ would be the args and $_ would be undefined

[04:39] <fax> hmm

[04:40] <TimToady> bare blocks it's the other way, $_ is the default arg and @_ is not there

[04:40] <fax> ah ok, so without the sub it's a bare block

[04:40] <TimToady> but there is no situation in which $_ is aliased to @_[0] unless you do it explicitly

[04:41] <TimToady> p6 makes a big deal about whether code is declared with an official word like "sub" or not

[04:41] <TimToady> for instance, "return" pays attention to that

[04:42] <TimToady> the official subs/methods/rules are all of type Routine

[04:42] <TimToady> otherwise they're of type Block

[04:42] <TimToady> (or some derivative, in either case)

[04:43] <fax> alright cool

[04:43] <TimToady> and basically, you only ever get @_ if you have a Routine with no explicit sig

[04:44] <fax> Does that include sub () { ... } ?

[04:44] <TimToady> no, that's explicitly empty

[04:44] <TimToady> and it might not apply to methods, since they always have at least one arg

[04:45] <TimToady> not sure we actually decided that one way or the other

[04:45] <TimToady> I wonder what pugs does...

[04:47] <TimToady> looks like pugs allows @_ for methods too.  seems okay to me

[14:56] <Aankhen``> L-L-V/C is used for binding, L-L-V for assignment, basically.

[16:21] *** dr-rho joined
[16:21] <avar> param lists on named subs don't work?

[16:21] <fax> well, sub foo ($a,$b) { $a }; works

[16:21] <fax> but sub foo ($a,$b) { $a ~ " " ~ $b}; doesn't

[16:21] <fax> the thing is that $a is the cell with something in it, instead of the actual object

[16:22] <avar> (typep and (cell-value) or whatever it was?

[16:23] <fax> I think the solution might be to have user defined named subs pass a keyword to kp6-make-sub saying that it needs to rebind the parameters to their cell values

[16:23] <fax> not sure yet though..

[16:45] <fax> seems great

[16:47] <[particle]> avar: pgc uses --target=[parse,past,post,pir]

[16:47] <[particle]> perhaps you could have something similar, as it greatly aids debugging

[16:48] <avar> it would be the same thing only -C :)

[16:49] <avar> do you mean --target or --parse ?

[16:49] <avar> I also have to stickin the visitor sequence there somewhere

[16:49] <Aankhen``> Seems okay to me.

[16:51] <[particle]> --target= controls what stage of transformation is emitted

[20:36] <dduncan> @seen avar

[20:36] <lambdabot> avar is in #perl6. I last heard avar speak 3h 47m 22s ago.

[20:40] <avar> dduncan: boo

[20:41] <dduncan> hello, I was just getting around to trying to test bleadperl on my Leopard seed

[20:41] <dduncan> but I first browsed the address you gave me using ftp and the folder didn't seem to be thee...

[20:42] <dduncan> ftp.linux.activestate.com/perl-current/

[20:43] *** TJCRI joined
[20:43] <dduncan> that said, I then tried: rsync -auvz rsync://ftp.linux.activestate.com/perl-current/ ...

[20:43] <dduncan> rather than connecting with ftp, and something seemed to happen

[20:44] <dduncan> so I guess 'ftp' in the domain name doesn't mean visible using ftp

[20:45] <dduncan> anyway, I seem to have blead now ... will keep people informed ...

[20:47] <avar> ok

[20:49] <dduncan> that said, my Leopard seed is almost 2 months old, so if blead has errors on it, it may not be worth trying to fix them since more recent seeds exist that I don't yet have ... and the final Leopard is out in a week

[20:49] *** weinig_ joined
[20:50] <dduncan> on the other hand, if it has no errors, that would be helpful to know

[21:57] <luke-jr> is it just me, or are there two seperate Perl6s?

[21:57] <luke-jr> Parrot vs Pugs

[21:59] <Tene> luke-jr: there's also kp6

[21:59] <luke-jr> O.o

[21:59] <luke-jr> kp6?

[21:59] <Tene> There are several implementations being built.

[22:00] <luke-jr> why?

[22:00] <Tene> "Perl 6" will be anything that can pass the Perl 6 test suite, basically.  There will be multiple implementations.

[22:00] *** kst left
[22:00] <Tene> Because nobody yet knows the absolute best way to build it, so different people are trying different things.

[22:01] <PerlJam> not to mention that they are all learning from each other

[22:01] <Tene> They're implementing different parts, trying out different ideas.

[22:01] *** REPLeffect joined
[22:01] <Tene> The parrot version will be "official", as I recall.

[22:01] *** kst joined
[22:02] <rindolf> Hi Tene 

[22:02] <rindolf> Hi all.

[22:02] <Tene> hi rindolf

[22:02] <rindolf> Tene: what's up?

[22:03] <Tene> rindolf: not much.  hanging out at work and considering getting some things done.

[22:03] <Tene> Looking at a couple of RT tickets for parrot.

[22:03] <rindolf> Tene: getting things done is a good idea.

[22:04] *** bilbo1507 joined
[22:04] <Tene> rindolf: Yep.  I've been working on their new website all week.  Taking a break from teaching for a couple of weeks.

[22:07] <Tene> rindolf: what's up with you?

[22:07] <rindolf> Tene: I'm fine.

[22:07] <rindolf> Tene: received an ad offer for my home site.

[22:07] <rindolf> Tene: now I need to edit the horrid HTML on the ads that were sent to me.

[22:08] <Tene> Heh.

[22:08] <rindolf> Tene: and we'll hold a collective hacking session for Archive-Zip on the next Tel Aviv Linux club meeting.

[22:10] <luke-jr> wouldn't it make sense to finish one implmentation first?

[22:11] <avar> $ perl script/kp6 -Bperl5 t/kp6/01-tap.t

[22:11] <avar> 1..2

[22:11] <avar> ok 1

[22:11] <avar> ok 2

[22:11] <Tene> luke-jr: different people are working on different parts of different implementations.

[22:11] * avar working on kp6 UI

[22:11] <fax> :D

[22:11] <Tene> Parrot is working on making a good backend.

[22:11] <Tene> Pugs was working on getting an implementation of the grammar up and usable as fast as possible, so that people could use it Right Now.

[22:12] <Tene> And that had a lot of benefits in finding out what actually using Perl 6 is like, and resulted in a lot of very good improvements to the specs.

[22:12] <PerlJam> luke-jr: No.  It's the different interactions between the implementations (because they are focused on different aspects) that has enriched the language design (and, in turn, the implementations)
