[09:42] <Karthik> could any one tell me how to write a perl script asking for a username and password from a user

[09:42] <Karthik> ?

[09:42] <Karthik> how to get a password from a user

[09:42] <Karthik> ?

[09:42] <Karthik> Any Idea?

[09:43] <moritz> Karthik: this channel is for development of compilers/interpreters for perl 6

[09:43] <moritz> Karthik: try #perlhelp or something

[09:43] <Karthik> ok , Thx moritz

[09:44] <Aankhen``> #perl might be better, actually.

[12:51] <weirdo2> heya

[12:51] <weirdo2> is it possible to write PROG2 with perl6 macros?

[12:51] *** maskd joined
[12:52] <wolverian> PROG2?

[12:53] <weirdo2> like perl5's do{} (dunno if it's the same in p6), but returns the value of the second expression evaluated

[12:54] <wolverian> why would you need a macro for that?

[12:54] <moritz> ?eval my $a = do {2; 3; }; $a

[12:54] <evalbot_r16538> \3

[12:54] <lumi> moritz: That's a PROGN, I think?

[12:54] <weirdo2> i'm curious whether p6 macros can find whole expressions in a code block

[12:55] <moritz> lumi: isn't PROG2 just a special case of PROGN?

[12:55] <lumi> You want to rewrite 'a; b; c;' to 'a; my $tmp = b; c; $tmp' 

[12:55] <moritz> now I understand

[12:58] <weirdo2> as a side note

[12:58] <weirdo2> i wonder whether M$' LINQ (sql-ish instructions in c#) could be easily simulated with macro{}

[12:59] <weirdo2> saw a glimpse of CLSQL, it deviated from sql syntax, though ;/

[12:59] <moritz> weirdo2: I'm not a macro expert, but I'm quite sure you can do things like that

[13:00] <weirdo2> IMO, aside from an awesome learning experience, macros are the only killer feature of lisp

[13:01] <weirdo2> wonder if perl's lack of homoiconicity would be an obstacle to implement equally uber-cool macros

[13:02] <weirdo2> couldn't stand lisp. no integration with POSIX, lack of syntax makes me to view the listing as one bulk

[13:02] <moritz> you can even lexically change perl 6's grammar (or so I believe), so it should all be possible ;)

[13:03] <weirdo2> do you get angry when people ask when it'll come out? because i want to :-P

[13:03] <moritz> weirdo2: christmas ;)

[13:03] <weirdo2> having a proper object model and a multimethod dispatch as an option is great, too

[13:03] <weirdo2> moritz, whoa, no kidding?

[13:03] <moritz> but don't ask which christmas :(

[13:04] <weirdo2> *g*

[13:04] <moritz> a rough estimate would be "sometimes 2008 propably"

[13:04] <moritz> but it could of course be sooner or later

[13:04] <weirdo2> not that i don't enjoy p5, though

[13:05] <moritz> but we all know that p5 has problems

[13:05] <moritz> weirdo2: would you like to help with perl6?

[13:05] <moritz> weirdo2: contributors are always welcome ;)

[13:05] <weirdo2> after a lisp adventure, i found a great urge to write many nested map's and lambdas

[13:05] <weirdo2> *g*

[13:06] <weirdo2> moritz, i once got an email from audreyt, but the link didn't work. audreyt didn't respond to my mails, too

[13:06] <moritz> weirdo2: commitbit is a bit broken nowadays, but obra++ will take care...

[13:07] <weirdo2> i don't promise i'll actually manage to write any code...

[13:07] <weirdo2> but if i do, i'll send it to ya'

[13:08] <moritz> nobody is bound to do anything, of course ;)

[13:08] <weirdo2> not to be picky, but haskell is a bit of turn-off to me :-)

[13:08] <moritz> weirdo2: I don't know haskell very much... so far I've written test cases and documentation...

[13:08] <moritz> and there are 6-in-6 implementation(s) beeing worked on

[13:09] <weirdo2> i once co-developed a macro language, if that counts :-)

[13:10] <moritz> weirdo2: commitbit seems to be up again...

[13:10] <moritz> weirdo2: so if you tell me your email (and perhaps real name if you want it to appear), I can try again to invite you

[13:10] <weirdo2> moritz, [email@hidden.address] stanislaw halik

[13:11] <obra> moritz: commitbit is not broken.

[13:12] <moritz> obra: ok, very good ;)

[13:12] <obra> moritz:  feather is sloooow, so we're seeing 20-30s page loads. but they're not timing out. 

[13:12] <obra> you should be able to invite as normal

[13:12] <moritz> weirdo2: "weirdo2" as nick?

[13:12] <weirdo2> moritz, sthalik, my email username

[13:13] <moritz> weirdo2: ok, request sent, hopefully you'll get a mail soon

[13:15] <moritz> "that nickname is already in use, sorry"... with the an @tehran.lain.pl email

[13:16] <weirdo2> oh, the one i couldn't register

[13:16] <moritz> does the email address still exist?

[13:16] <weirdo2> try sthalik2, and sthalik+perl@ if it complains about the same email address

[13:16] <weirdo2> moritz, yes, it does

[13:17] <lumi> weirdo2: I think macros are too underspecced to do it yet

[13:17] <weirdo2> imvho, p6 could win big with macros. it's a largely underestimated feature :-P

[13:18] <lumi> weirdo2: Possibly you can use the "is parsed" and STD to do it right now

[13:20] <moritz> lumi: if STD worked in any existing implementation, yes ;)

[13:20] <weirdo2> hope the "second system effect" doesn't apply so badly here

[13:20] <lumi> moritz: "do it right now" as in "in a specced way", not "in a working way" :P

[13:21] <weirdo2> not worried about accusations of vaporware, but there's so much of everything, especially for a new implementation

[13:21] <moritz> lumi: ok ;)

[13:21] <weirdo2> yay! got an email!

[13:21] <moritz> commitbit++, obra++

[13:22] <weirdo2> any hints with PREFIX?

[13:22] <weirdo2> :-)

[13:22] <moritz> prefix?

[13:22] <weirdo2> INSTALL says it's broken. a Bad Thing

[13:23] <moritz> it is indeed

[13:23] <moritz> most pugs developers never install it, just run it locally

[13:23] <moritz> that's why nobody cares

[13:23] <lumi> weirdo2: Fixing that would be a Good Thing

[13:23] <moritz> and I don't understand the build system :(

[13:23] <weirdo2> yay! sounds like a job for me
