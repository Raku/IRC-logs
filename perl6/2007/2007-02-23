[00:05] <dduncan> re the latest synopsis update, that option to have an extra short label for a longer named parameter looks useful

[00:05] <dduncan> as I've found that the best internal name is often too long to be used repeatedly as a named argument

[00:06] <dduncan> and hence I've been using shorter names throughout

[00:06] <dduncan> on the other hand, trying to figure out a name that is both short and descriptive allows for some more thinking about what works well

[00:18] <TimToady> dduncan: it seems like it was the logical way to get at :g($global) adverbs as well, and I decided it shouldn't have too much impact if the long names are just the fallback.

[00:44] <Limbic_Region> hey TimToady - is hash/array slices in scalar context documented anywhere (perl5 and/or perl6)?

[00:45] <TimToady> don't think it's documented in P5

[00:45] <TimToady> if it is, probably documented to take the last value

[00:45] * Limbic_Region couldn't find it in perldata

[00:46] <TimToady> in P6 would always turn into [...]

[00:46] <Limbic_Region> thanks

[00:46] <TimToady> there's nothing in P6 that automatically returns the last value of a list except [-1]

[00:47] <TimToady> well, any maybe pop

[00:47] <Limbic_Region> reverse shift

[00:47] <TimToady> but none of those are "automatic"

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> yeah

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> I was just thinking that you had to be wrong though

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> since that would imply there is only one way to do it

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> :P

[00:50] <TimToady> I'm trying to think what's there that would only give you one way.  .WHICH and .WHAT maybe

[00:50] <TimToady> though you could always write macros...

[00:50] <TimToady> actually, those come in functional forms too, so I guess they don't work

[00:50] <tene> could you manually dig them out of a symbol table or some such?

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> speaking of which, what synopses speak to introspection?

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> s/what/which/

[00:51] <TimToady> mostly S12, some in S02

[00:52] <TimToady> a lot of it is intentionally punted off to .HOWland, which is where MO and Moose come in.

[00:53] <Limbic_Region> audreyt has indicated that 6.28 release is RSN so I will read S12 in detail RSN too

[00:53] <TimToady> S12 won't talk about MO

[00:53] * Limbic_Region has mostly held off

[00:53] <TimToady> well, not much...

[00:54] <TimToady> presumably .HOW.methods is returning something from MO

[00:54] <Limbic_Region> who was the prime mover in the meta object work - stvn?

[00:54] <TimToady> yes

[00:55] <tene> "prime mover"

[00:55] <TimToady> with a lot of help from audreyt and, putter was it?

[00:55] * tene things of Thomas Aquinas.

[00:55] <Limbic_Region> I think so

[00:55] <tene> s/thing/think/

[00:56] *** nipotaway is now known as nipotan

[00:56] <TimToady> and of course nothingmuch is at one level the prime mover of MO

[00:56] <TimToady> sort of the Moose porter

[00:56] <Limbic_Region> so has perl 6 fully adopted the MO model?

[00:56] <Limbic_Region> and if so, shouldn't S12 cover it in greater detail

[00:57] <TimToady> no, Perl 6 is completel agnostic on the subject of metaobject models.

[00:57] <TimToady> s:5th/ /y /

[00:57] <TimToady> s:5th/ <sp> /y / rathre

[00:57] <TimToady> er

[00:58] <TimToady> "Pay no attention to the MOP behind the .HOW curtain..."

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> ok

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> well, I then don't much care about MO as the means by which pugs delivers an S12 perl 6

[00:59] <TimToady> of course, the fact that P6 uses MO for its default MOP should likely be documented somewhere eventually...

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> I just hadn't followed S12 too closely until it was something I could actually use

[01:00] <Limbic_Region> perl 5 was my first dive into OO

[01:00] <Limbic_Region> and while I speak Java relatively fluently

[01:00] <TimToady> you can use most of S12 now, it's just a handrolled MOP that's not very introspectible

[01:00] <TimToady> (in pugs)

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> I don't quite grok things that are that abstract without some practical implementation to play with

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> oh, I realize that now

[01:01] <TimToady> 6.28 should change that part

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> but not when I wanted to

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> pugs OO was changing daily when I was interested

[01:01] <TimToady> indeed, the abstraction barrier is precisely why MO is swept behind the .HOW curtain.

[01:37] <putter> can one create a A.pm which when used, causes a B.pm's import() to run as if it had been called directly?

[01:38] <putter> if B has an actual import() sub, rather than getting it via inheritance, one could simply goto() it.

[01:38] <putter> and if !UNIVERSAL::can(B,'import'), you are done.

[01:39] <putter> but if B's import() comes via inheritance, perhaps from Exporter... (visions of special casing that pushed aside for just now), what can one do?

[04:03] <putter> how about yet another variable scope?  "nested local".

[04:04] <putter> consider a regex / (...{local $a=3}...{X}... ) ... {Y} /

[04:04] <putter> currently both X and Y can see $a=3.

[04:05] <putter> the objective is a scope such that X can see $a=3, but not Y.

[04:05] <putter> a "local" scope which respects the regex group nesting.

[04:50] *** amnesiac joined
[04:50] <putter> scary from a runtime performance perspective.  but nice from a development perspective.  want to do yet another p6 on p5 variant,  "package Foo; use base SomeExistingOne; sub mumble {...mutant mumbling...}"

[04:54] <putter> @tell TimToady  re extensibility of the p6 grammar, one needs to be able to retract as well as extend, no?  So one can play games like starting with the quick and dirty, or stable, version of token/rule/regex x, and then others selectively override it with more real, or experimental, variants.

[04:54] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[04:55] *** ashleyb joined
[04:56] <TimToady> sure, but the overriding is based on longnames including longest token match.

[04:56] <putter> I find myself writing   regex inherited_hack_rule_no_longer_needed { <fail> }  overrides.

[04:57] <putter> no longest token

[04:58] <TimToady> 'only' or 'proto' would cause this rule to hide all rules with the same short name

[05:00] <TimToady> oh, $<foo> already scopes to the current (...)

[05:01] <putter> class A { regex statement_control { if ...havent implemented else yet...} } class B does A { regex statement_control { if ...full version...} }   where does the only go?

[05:02] <TimToady> in front of the 2nd "regex"

[05:02] <TimToady> same place "proto" or "multi" would go

[05:02] <putter> re $<foo>  !!!  :)  *pause*  user hat replaced with have to code it over the weekend hat.  ?!?! oh, sigh.

[05:04] <putter> how would B get rid of if entirely?  regex statement_control { if...and whatever else might be contributing to the token left intact... <fail> }  ?

[18:33] *** justatheory joined
[18:34] <ingy> kolibrie: yes

[18:34] <kolibrie> oh, goody

[18:34] <TimToady> probably want to wait till Damian comes out with his parser

[18:34] <ingy> nod

[18:35] <TimToady> and just embed that.

[18:35] <ingy> it's not really in my brain at the moment, but yes

[18:35] <TimToady> he's just about done with it, I believe.

[18:35] <ingy> awesome

[18:35] <kolibrie> very nice

[18:35] <TimToady> I'll need to install a translated version of it into the P6 parser as well.

[18:36] <TimToady> since P6 is supposed to be able to access its surrounding pod via %= variables

[18:36] <ingy> oh cool. so perldoc is parser into the ast?

[18:36] <ingy> parse*d*

[18:37] <TimToady> yes, has to be an official subset of P6 grammar

[18:37] <TimToady> which is of course extensible...

[18:37] <ingy> :)

[18:37] <ingy> moment of panic relieved

[18:37] <TimToady> It occurred to me that you might take that wrong.  :)

[18:37] <ingy> it was a very short moment

[18:42] <TimToady> does anyone remember how to get a web svn diff of the synopses?  seems like something there should be a top-level page for somewhere...

[18:56] *** IllvilJa joined
[19:02] <baest> TimToady: can you explain what %= does or is a specification available somewhere (couldn't find it in the synopsis). Very curious on precisly what it does

[19:05] <PerlJam> baest: %= looks like mod-equals to me.  

[19:05] <PerlJam> baest: i.e.,  $a %= b  is the same as $a = $a % b;

[19:05] <baest> PerlJam: oh, yes, I'm not precise I was thinking about: 19:36:21 < TimToady> since P6 is supposed to be able to access its surrounding pod via %= variables

[19:05] <TimToady> = is a twigil indicate a file-scoped document variable.  The = is meant to remind you of =begin/=end

[19:05] <Limbic_Region> ?eval my $num = 100; $num %= 3; $num

[19:06] <PerlJam> oh! POD context

[19:06] <TimToady> no, term context

[19:06] <TimToady> so @=DATA could be the new <DATA>

[19:07] <TimToady> but it would be a =begin DATA/=end DATA podstream

[19:07] <[particle]> so, =$filehandle becomes $=filehandle?

[19:07] <TimToady> no

[19:07] <TimToady> has nothing to do with filehandles anymore

[19:07] <[particle]> 's confusing, though

[19:07] <baest> that makes sense. So why would you access the pod info. Is that instead of repeating yourself? Not sure I understand the effects of it

[19:08] <PerlJam> baest: literate programming comes to mind  :-)

[19:08] <TimToady> you can think of it as a displaced heredoc

[19:08] <PerlJam> baest: other forms of introspection too

[19:08] <TimToady> and autodocs can refer to pod comments near them

[19:09] <TimToady> so a function could have a method to return its documentation, for instance.

[19:09] <PerlJam> runnable examples are always nice

[19:09] <TimToady> some languages kludge this in with an extra declaration in the header of the function

[19:09] <baest> TimToady: that's very cool. That is something that really bugged, that you had to repeat the options for a script twice or be _very_ creative

[19:10] <TimToady> or by processing comments

[19:10] <baest> bugged *me

[19:10] <PerlJam> TimToady: are you making digs at python there?  :-)

[19:10] <TimToady> not intentionally

[19:10] <TimToady> but if the shoe fits

[19:10] <PerlJam> If you'd said something about semantic whitespace I would have been sure you were targeting python 

[19:11] <TimToady> python is sort of self-targeting that way... :)

[19:11] <baest> :)

[19:11] <PerlJam> TimToady: so, how is your day going so far?  (What is it that you do for a living these days?)

[19:12] <TimToady> I'm almost awake by now.

[19:12] <TimToady> my blood pressure started too high this morning, so I'm taking it pretty easy, apart from posting to perlmonks, which can raise anyone's blood pressure

[19:13] <tene> perhaps give functions an "is documented" trait?

[19:13] <TimToady> I officially work for Netlogic Microsystems

[19:13] <TimToady> but they pay me to work on Perl 6 a lot. :)

[19:13] <TimToady> tene: that is precisely what I'd like to avoid.

[19:13] <PerlJam> well (Netlogic Microsystems)++ then

[19:14] <jisom> that'd require as "is documented where" trait

[19:15] <TimToady> or if there is such an "is documented where" it would default to "the preceding pod block"

[19:15] <TimToady> or the pod block links it the other direction instead

[19:16] <tene> that could also work.

[19:16] <tene> or support both

[19:17] <jisom> and if you have some of your pod inside the function and some outside because you want the comments to be close to the code?

[19:17] *** diakopter joined
[19:17] <TimToady> main point is, pod is a data structure navigable by the program.

[19:17] <TimToady> everything else is convention

[19:17] <jisom> how strict is the parsing going to be?

[19:17] <TimToady> how strict do you want it?

[19:18] *** Belaf joined
[19:18] <diakopter> TimToady: how would one go about making a pragma to embed interdependent tests in/among their corresponding methods/subs?

[19:18] <TimToady> certainly the default for documentation can be a little more forgiving.

[19:18] <PerlJam> TimToady: did you see chromatic's recent use.perl post?

[19:18] <jisom> the stricter it is, the easier to write a parser(even if harder to write for beginners)

[19:19] <PerlJam> jisom: perl is/has a parser

[19:19] * [particle] agrees with jisom -- let's not go the direction of HTML 1.0

[19:19] <jisom> except be strict in the release stuff.....perl5 sort of has that issue, bad pod in the released in the tarball

[19:19] <jisom> *in the release tarball

[19:19] <diakopter> TimToady: I mean, if pod will be runtime accessible by the module and vice versa ... why not tests as well

[19:20] * PerlJam suddenly experiences some deja vu

[19:20] <TimToady> diakopter: it's been mentioned before as a possibility, but for the moment I'm lumping that in the "conventions to be established at some point" category.

[19:33] <TimToady> Cheop's Law: everything costs more and takes longer

[19:34] <jisom> unless you make it open source and get people to work on it for free, then it just takes longer

[19:35] <PerlJam> jison: the costs just change from monetary to something else.

[19:36] <TimToady> mostly opportunity cost of letting others get ahead, which can raise your blood pressure.  :)

[19:37] <kolibrie> PerlJam: my boss is looking for someone, but I'm not sure exactly what he's looking for

[19:37] <TimToady> a lot of people are looking for someone...

[19:38] * kolibrie never found his childhood kindred spirit -- too late now

[19:39] <TimToady> some of us just stay children until we do.  :)

[19:39] <kolibrie> hmm, have to think about that

[19:43] <xerox> TimToady: that law seem to be related to the second principle of thermodynamics. There's space for developement (-:

[19:44] <Limbic_Region> xerox - I know you from ##java land right?

[19:44] <xerox> Limbic_Region: YUCK. Here and #haskell.

[19:44] <moritz> xerox: the principle basically says that the universe will end as a homogenous mass - not a good place to live in ;)

[19:45] <Limbic_Region> hrmmm

[19:45] * Limbic_Region is trying to remember the helpful soul in ##java whose handle started with an x

[19:46] <jisom> but the universe is mostly homogenous, empty space, we're an anomaly in the homogeneousness of the universe

[19:46] <jisom> my spell checker says it's a word and spelled right!

[19:47] <xerox> I think both are oversemplification, but then I don't have a better theory of everything to propose. I can reccommend Penrose stuff to read, and watch, though.

[19:47] <TimToady> no, the universe is mostly a seething mass of virtual particles.  we are merely persistent accounting errors.

[19:47] * [particle] *coughs*

[19:47] <TimToady> some are more persistent than others...

[19:47] <moritz> TimToady: that explains a lot ;)

[19:48] * [particle] seeths

[19:48] <moritz> xerox: does penrose lectures thermodynamics? I always thought he did some QM or unified theories...

[19:49] <TimToady> well, the fact is whenever we say "an electron started here and ended up there", it's mostly wrong.

[19:49] <moritz> TimToady: that's why we talk of wave functions ;)

[19:49] <moritz> or at leas I do ;)

[19:49] * [particle] waves

[19:49] <xerox> moritz: some of his ideas are explained in a quite funny way in his special talks for the MSRI (<http://msri.org>)

[19:49] *** justatheory joined
[19:50] <TimToady> nah, they just obey Spacetime Transactional Memory

[19:50] <moritz> [particle]: or forward - it so hard to tell since the schroedinger equation is invariant under time inversion ;)

[19:51] <allbery_b> there is that thing where an electron moving backward in time is indistinguishable from a positron

[19:51] <TimToady> STM is what keeps the accounting errors persistent, lucky for us.

[19:51] <xerox> Ladies and gentleman, here it is the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking.

[23:16] <TimToady> since you're not trying to connect two sides so much

[23:17] <TimToady> (hence, I'm not too worried about sigils, which typically signal the start of a noun phrase.)

[23:17] <TimToady> $x.foo.bar.baz()  has a nice shape.

[23:18] <TimToady> especially when trying to pick out what will interpolate

[23:22] <putter> :)

[23:23] <putter> $a.foo($b.bar("fribble",3),"up")

[23:23] <putter> a.foo(b.bar("fribble",3),"up")

[23:24] <putter> could be.  interesting.  hadn't thought of it that way.

[23:25] <TimToady> interesting that all our interpolaters are "strong" vertically

[23:25] <TimToady> $ @ % & { \

[23:25] <TimToady> and | for interpolating a caputre

[23:25] <TimToady> *capture

[23:26] <TimToady> though caputre is a cool word

[23:26] <putter> lol.

[23:26] <TimToady> caputré

[23:26] <putter> and ./foo  blends away, atleast in my typeface

[23:27] <TimToady> certain $.foo and .foo have a very different shape on the front.

[23:30] <TimToady> I was worried about the vertical visual parsing of 1,2,3 Z 4,5,6 until I realized that was artificial

[23:30] <TimToady> and you usually have @foo Z @bar

[23:31] *** Squern joined
[23:31] <TimToady> mixed with letters the Z stands out adequately, I think.

[23:31] <TimToady> same for @foo X @bar

[23:32] <putter> indeed

[23:32] <TimToady> part of my unstating reasoning for going from XX to X

[23:32] <TimToady> unstated even

[23:33] <TimToady> I don't usually talk about half the things I think about...

[23:33] <TimToady> but your bargraphs brought it back to mind

[23:33] <putter> if you journal any of them, that might make for an interesting post/book/mumble sometime

[23:34] <TimToady> I worry that those experiments are measuring the amount of time to produce a number, not an understanding.

[23:34] <putter> yes indeed.

[23:34] <TimToady> but it's hard to measure how well people integrate the areas under the "curve", and a lot easier to measure how long it takes them to say 12.2

[23:35] <TimToady> the bars are there for "bulk" reasons that are more accessible to the backbrain than the front.

[23:35] *** xinming joined
[23:35] <putter> hmm, there's a question.  one-laptop-per-child is getting closer to release.  what could one collect/write to facilitate graph _understanding_.  "graph as language".  hmm

[23:36] <TimToady> much like some people still prefer analog clocks even though it's faster to say 6:36

[23:36] <TimToady> but then they have trouble translating the numbers back to the "feel" of time.

[23:37] <putter> and lots of folks liked my http://www.vendian.org/envelope/dir2/day_of_dots_clock/

[23:38] *** krod joined
[23:38] <putter> objective was to help folks develop a feel for order of magnitude time.  ie, what's 10^5 seconds.

[23:38] <krod> Could someone tell me the proper way of doing this: http://pastebin.ca/369643 ... I am trying to store the output of exec(uptime) somehow

[23:38] <buubot> The paste 369643 has been copied to: http://erxz.com/pb/1512

[23:39] <putter> that doesn't *look* like perl6...

[23:39] <allbery_b> perl5 questions are best asked in #perl

[23:40] <putter> `uptime`

[23:41] <jrockway> maybe people think perl5.6 == perl6

[23:41] <putter> anyone know if PIL2JS is still working at the moment?

[23:42] <putter> "after all, the 5 is part of the language name, isn't it?  been there forever". :)

[23:43] * allbery_b rolls his eyes

[23:44] <TimToady> hmm, that does make me wonder whether foo1.2.3 should be consistenly parsed as a token.

[23:44] <TimToady> v1.2.3 would then fall out of that

[23:44] *** krod left
[23:45] <TimToady> maybe even foo.1.2.3

[23:45] <[particle]> and v1.2.3b1.4_209f

[23:46] <putter> strawman hypothesis:  if PIL2JS is working, or can be easily repaired, that seems a good way (the best way?) to drive development of a new front end.  take tests, emit old PIL1, if PIL2JS works on it no less well than with pugs -CPIL, you are golden.  can immediately use entire pugs t/.  without conflating runtime development (much).

[23:47] <putter> thoughts?  questions?  "you forgots"?

[23:47] * [particle] wonders what *-* is

[23:47] <xinming> 06:32:52 < putter> objective was to help folks develop a feel for order of magnitude time.  ie, what's 10^5 seconds.

[23:47] <xinming> 06:33:04 < krod> Could someone tell me the proper way of doing this: http://pastebin.ca/369643 ... I am trying to store the output of exec(uptime) somehow

[23:47] <buubot> The paste 369643 has been copied to: http://erxz.com/pb/1512

[23:47] <putter> re token, hmm.  no opinion.  don't really understand the space

[23:47] <TimToady> the dumbell operator?

[23:48] <putter> err, the design space :)

[23:48] <xinming> Oops. sorry.

[23:48] <TimToady> well .1 can never be a method call.

[23:48] <xinming> Mis click

[23:49] <TimToady> it either has a number on the front or something else.

[23:49] <putter> hmmmm

[23:49] <TimToady> so if it has a non-number, we could treat them all consistently.

[23:50] <putter>  .1  is 0.1 or $_.1 ?

[23:50] <TimToady> could also be a canonical namemangling for things like infix:<+> somehow

[23:50] <TimToady> at the moment bare .1 is outlawed.

[23:50] <putter> k

[23:50] <TimToady> er, no, that was 1.

[23:51] <TimToady> .1 is 0.1

[23:51] <TimToady> least surprise

[23:51] *** stevan__ joined
[23:51] <putter> but a bit of a gotcha here

[23:51] <TimToady> but foo.1 can't be a method call

[23:51] <TimToady> a listop requires a space, foo .1

[23:52] <putter> ^.^

[23:52] <putter> (eyebrow non-method call)

[23:54] <xinming> TimToady: I'd suggest 0.1 for number. using .1 form is not as good as it should be. At least. I don't think people will think It's tedious for just a '0' more

[23:54] <putter> oh, right.  confused.  eyebrows down.

[23:55] <TimToady> xinming: you could be right, if only to prevent people from wondering if .1 means $_.1 somehow.

[23:55] <putter> no comments/questions on the strawman in the corner?

[23:56] <TimToady> I don't understand really.

[23:56] <putter> np

[23:56] <TimToady> I just push arbitrary symbols around.

[23:56] <TimToady> My mind is sort of a Chinese Room.  :)

[23:56] <putter> :)

[23:58] <TimToady> are you proposing a way of working on new frontends without knowing Haskell?

[23:58] <putter> let's see...

[23:58] <TimToady> and what do you mean by a "frontend"?

[23:59] <putter> the objective is to have a "second" p6 parser.  mostly because
