[00:00] <Limbic_Region> salutations audreyt - still hospitalized?

[00:01] <audreyt> yeah.

[00:01] <audreyt> going to get today's test results in a couple hours

[00:02] <audreyt> to see if I can be discharged. about 50% chance I think

[00:03] * Limbic_Region keeps you in his prayers

[00:10] <[M]erk> TimToady, I think that S05 assumes that the reader is already familiar with perl5 regex. This sort of defeats the purpose of having a specification.

[06:05] <brad__> hi

[06:06] <audreyt> brad__: greetings!

[06:07] <brad__> audrey, i have always wanted to meet you

[06:07] <brad__> i hope you are feeling better

[06:07] <brad__> not often i get to meet a luminary

[06:07] <brad__> i am a perl6 lurker and pugs player-wither

[06:08] <brad__> sometimes commenting on your blog as "grumpy"

[06:08] <audreyt> well, this particular one is more flickry than luminary at the moment

[06:08] <audreyt> oh hi!

[06:08] <brad__> i was wondering what happened to you

[06:08] <brad__> then again after your rash of insane output, i was assuming burnout

[06:09] <brad__> which is fair

[06:09] <audreyt> I thought so too

[06:09] <audreyt> but burnout usually recover within a few weeks

[06:09] <brad__> hopefully pugs will be fun again soon

[06:09] <brad__> no more politicking

[06:09] <audreyt> and this time my nonmotivation and fatigue gradually worsened

[06:10] <audreyt> so I'm glad it has a much simpler explanation

[06:10] <audreyt> and I'm on my way to recovery

[06:10] <brad__> awesome, we need you if only for your kick-ass presentations

[06:10] <brad__> but your code is nice too!

[06:10] <audreyt> well, it's a pity that the onset happened on the night before my google.tw talk :/

[06:10] <audreyt> but we'll schedule another talk next month probably :)

[06:11] <brad__> cool

[06:11] <brad__> how far out of sync do you think pugs has become with the state-of-the synopses?

[06:11] <audreyt> I wondered if grumpY! works at yahoo (hence the Y!) for quite a while

[06:11] <brad__> yes i am old-time yahoo. 

[06:12] <brad__> i wrote a bunch of the early parts of the site

[06:12] <audreyt> aha. still @yahoo?

[06:12] <brad__> 11 years+ now

[06:12] <brad__> yes still there

[06:12] <audreyt> cool!

[06:12] <brad__> larry built my house

[06:12] <audreyt> I heard that the early parts were all perl

[06:12] <brad__> yes!

[06:12] <brad__> and i still root for perl there

[06:12] <audreyt> :D

[06:12] <audreyt> so, re out of sync. ~3months

[06:12] <brad__> when we were trying to find a replacement for our internal server-side lang, i chaired to mod_perl side

[06:13] <brad__> i lost to php, its been downhill ever since

[06:13] <audreyt> well I was told that parts of Yahoo is still in mod_perl...

[06:13] <audreyt> but php is "canonical"

[06:13] <brad__> yes and yes, they still provide some support to mod_perl, but they'll likely kill that over time

[06:13] <brad__> too bad too

[06:13] <brad__> but its water under the bridge

[06:14] <brad__> they intentionally wanted an idiot language

[06:14] <brad__> and they got one in php

[06:14] *** BooK_ joined
[06:14] <audreyt> re politicking, yeah it took most of the fun away from me when I was in .br

[06:14] <audreyt> renewed my resolve to ignore all politics this time around

[06:14] <brad__> and the reddit postings must not help

[06:14] <brad__> i am sure you have seen

[06:14] <tene> explain "intentionally wanted an idiot language"?

[06:15] <audreyt> no, I had not

[06:15] <audreyt> nor do I actually want to

[06:15] <brad__> tene - a motivation to get a tool that had some power but not as complex as perl

[06:15] <brad__> which i will rewrite as wanting an idiot language

[06:15] <brad__> my own editorial there

[06:16] <brad__> at least with php4 i can say you can feel your iq drop as you use it

[06:16] *** CardinalNumber joined
[06:17] <brad__> in any case audrey, i credit you with leading me to haskell

[06:17] <brad__> if perl6 never pans out i will get something out of this

[06:17] <brad__> i am in no danger of being in your realm of expertise of course

[06:18] <brad__> room has gone silent...was it my cologne?

[06:18] <tene> The room is often silent.

[06:18] <audreyt> well, hopefully not anymore :)

[06:18] <audreyt> brad__: do you prefer the nick "brad" or "bjc"?

[06:18] <audreyt> (when committing to pugs)

[06:19] <brad__> audrey - let me commit to this. i will read the pugs code and try to understand it, then i will humbly take a commit bit for something harmless

[06:20] <brad__> it is important for you to understand how far you are ahead of the rest of us

[06:20] <audreyt> an invitation is on its way to your inbox regardless... :)

[06:20] <brad__> which one?! you can send to [email@hidden.address]
[06:20] <brad__> oh boy, i put an email address in a irc log

[06:20] <brad__> game over for me

[06:21] <audreyt> done

[06:21] <brad__> i will promise you that i will crack open the pugs code again

[06:21] <audreyt> woot!

[06:21] <brad__> my kids grant me three hours a night for me stuff

[06:21] <audreyt> are you not also bjc @ yahoo?

[06:22] <brad__> i gave up that email because of too much spam, i also gave up [email@hidden.address] years agao too (i had it before yahoo mail existed, when yahoo used @yahoo.com)

[06:22] <audreyt> (I sent an invitation there, too, with nick "bjc". the b7j0c one I sent an invitation too with nick "brad".)

[06:22] <audreyt> gotcha.

[06:22] <brad__> thanks audrey! i will not waste the opportunity

[06:23] <audreyt> wow, such politeness :) 

[06:23] <brad__> well i legitimately think you are a genius. so i am giving deference

[06:24] <audreyt> re the reddit post. after 3mo of rest I can honestly say I have no hard feeling wrt chromatic anymore... he sometimes unintentionally exaggerates things for effect (such as the parrot's release frequency), but overall he is cool.

[06:25] <brad__> i sensed that, i think some people just like a little drama

[06:25] <audreyt> aye. so it's all fine now

[06:26] <audreyt> please test that svn works by adding yourself to AUTHORS and commit -- our new invite.pugscode.org system havn't seen much use, unlike the old one

[06:26] <audreyt> and welcome aboard :)

[06:26] <brad__> thanks!

[06:26] <brad__> hey, i thought you would be a shoe-in to use darcs

[06:27] <audreyt> there is also darcs.pugscode.org.

[06:27] <brad__> i tried it out of haskell-snobbery and am sold on it

[06:27] <audreyt> read-only at the moment, though

[06:27] <audreyt> but people do use it all the time to track our commits

[06:27] <brad__> i am interested in what os you use, out of curiosity

[06:27] <audreyt> (as seen in http logs)

[06:27] <audreyt> freebsd for a long, long time.

[06:27] <audreyt> finally decided I can't hack all layers of computing

[06:27] <audreyt> so I'm on darwin/osx now

[06:28] <brad__> hmm, i am on freebsd6.2 now

[06:28] <audreyt> which is like freebsd except it doesn't prompt me to learn obscure computing knowledge that often

[06:28] <offby1> yeah, just getting my wireless card working on FreeBSD 6.2 was a challenge

[06:28] <brad__> really? i have an ANCIENT laptop and wpa_supplicant did the trick!

[06:29] <brad__> with a netgear card

[06:29] <audreyt> and I had to hack snd_ich to unbreak the sound card that's broken during  a _point release_

[06:29] <audreyt> etc, etc. :)

[06:29] <brad__> hmmm, yeah multimedia has never been a bsd strong suit

[06:29] <brad__> but then again my UI of choice is gnu screen

[06:29] <brad__> so my needs are modest

[06:29] <audreyt> ditto.

[06:29] <offby1> brad__: I have no idea what wpa_supplicant is.

[06:30] <brad__> screen over dwm!

[06:30] <audreyt> oh and darwin runs OmniGraffle :)

[06:30] <offby1> I naïvely expected it to just work when I plugged it in.  Silly me

[06:30] <brad__> offby1 - in debian and freebsd you have to do some twiddling for wireless. ubuntu is what you want if you want wireless out of the box

[06:30] <brad__> there are good reasons for this

[06:30] <brad__> ubuntu will use binary blobs

[06:31] <brad__> debian won't

[06:31] <brad__> freebsd will

[06:31] <brad__> but they don't care that much about laptops (yet)

[06:31] <tene> And yet they will all run Perl6!

[06:31] <brad__> that they will

[06:31] * audreyt wonders about writing device drivers with perl6

[06:32] <brad__> in any case, my UI is designed to be a console done with xft fonts. that is all i want

[06:32] <brad__> i REALLY use elinks as my browser

[06:32] <audreyt> elinks > w3m because... ?

[06:32] <audreyt> (w3m is my browser of choice.)

[06:32] <offby1> brad__: I had been using ubuntu for just that reason.  Foolishly upgraded to feisty, and ... wireless stopped working :-(

[06:32] <brad__> elinks is just a weee bit easier to customize

[06:32] <brad__> and also, it had lua scripting

[06:32] <audreyt> ah. Lua.

[06:33] <audreyt> very important that.

[06:33] <brad__> but that was before i discovered PRIVOXY

[06:33] <brad__> now i do not need lua scripting

[06:33] <brad__> PRIVOXY FTW

[06:33] <brad__> pcre-enabled net proxy!

[06:34] *** rfordinal joined
[06:34] *** CardinalNumber is now known as ProperNoun

[06:34] <brad__> also elinks has numbered links

[06:34] <brad__> numbered links are important in a text browser

[06:34] <brad__> crucial imo

[06:35] <brad__> in any case i still beat the drum of having parrot be the vm of firefox

[06:35] <brad__> because i hate js

[06:36] <brad__> but it will never happen

[06:37] *** d4rk_hun7er left
[06:38] <brad__> okay audrey - created a passcode at pugscode. what now?

[06:38] <tene> brad__: add yourself to AUTHORS and commit

[06:38] <audreyt> re tamarin FTW. yes definitely.

[06:39] <audreyt> also JS2/ECMA4 is really, really not bad.

[06:39] <audreyt> I can't bring myself to hate it at all :)

[06:40] <brad__> i know the next js is not bad, but i hate being denied choice

[06:40] <brad__> why must there be only one client language?

[06:40] <audreyt> well as long as we target tarmarin

[06:40] <audreyt> it's just another vm

[06:40] <brad__> yes but is js a viable compile target?

[06:40] <audreyt> oh definitely.

[06:40] <brad__> i wonder

[06:40] <brad__> we'll see

[06:41] <audreyt> it may be that tamarin bytecode is easiest to target

[06:41] <audreyt> but in any case we need to get 6.28.0 out of the door... an object model bridge can only exist when _both_ sides exist

[06:41] <brad__> hopefully, actually the world does not give a poop what i think, the web platform is settled

[06:41] <audreyt> which reminds me. I should get hacking :)

[06:42] <audreyt> (bbiab)

[06:42] <gaal> audreyt: how much newVal changes should go into 6.28.0?

[06:42] <audreyt> gaal: all of it

[06:42] <brad__> okay with that i will let you sign off, i got my fandom in for the night, i met audrey. audrey i will check out the pugs tree and get reading

[06:42] <gaal> need to revisit much of Parser.*

[06:42] <audreyt> gaal: though I'm still not sure about the VPure/VMut/VExt variance typing

[06:42] <audreyt> vv('some string').reverse

[06:42] <audreyt> working using MO today

[06:43] <audreyt> yeah. it's better to carry the P/STM/IO type annotation directly within the Val type

[06:43] <audreyt> then we only have the Val type.

[06:43] <audreyt> (for now.)

[06:43] <audreyt> since we're optimizing for consistency not for speed

[06:43] <brad__> bye everyone, thanks for putting up with me

[06:43] <audreyt> the intrinsics and undefs can just be normal Val for now

[10:57] <wolverian> oh. it is?

[10:57] <Juerd> Run it with -D

[10:57] <wolverian> is it because of bitlbee itself, or the method it is used on feather? I was just setting up it on my own server, too.

[10:57] <Juerd> Sure - people on instant messaging will assume you're in for intimate personal talk, while feather is hardly secure.

[10:58] <wolverian> ah. true enough.

[11:02] <wolverian> hrm, well. irssi does something it doesn't like and the connection fails, anyway.

[12:54] <avar> eek

[12:54] <moritz> POSIX defines regexes?

[12:55] <avar> yep

[12:55] <moritz> in this channel I learn more than in 13 years school ;)

[23:29] <putter> TimToady: is there a spec way to select p6 dialect within a p5 re?  perhaps (?p6) (?p6:...) ?  Don't ever need (?-p6) ;)

[23:30] <putter> (?5) (?5:...)

[23:30] <putter> err, no.  (?6) (?6:...)

[23:31] <moritz> putter: uhm, from p5 I don't know such a construct, so why should it exist in p5-regexes in p6?

[23:31] <moritz> putter: I thought they were mainly for backwards compatibility and convenience...

[23:32] <moritz> putter: and if you need more advanced features you can fall back to p6 rules

[23:32] <putter> symmetry?  it's a backward compatible mod of p5 re syntax.

[23:33] <putter> if you have flavor x and y, and you can embed x in y, it's just asking for headaches to be unable to embed y in x.

[23:37] <putter> re "mod of p5", no pun intended.  really.

[23:38] <moritz> well, I'd say that both points are valid and that it's just a matter of taste/convenience which one to choose

[23:39] <moritz> (of course this beeing perl I know what the answer will be ;))

[23:39] <putter> lol

[23:39] *** justatheory joined
[23:43] <moritz> putter: and beeing (becoming...) a physicist I appreciate symmetries as well ;)

[23:45] <putter> Basically why I'm here.  Perl's eschewing of the otherwise pervasive "no, you may NOT have that power, because it {can't be compiled efficiently, can't be type checked, is ugly, is likely to be abused, confuses newbies, etc, etc, etc}".

[23:48] <putter> Hmm.  General eschewing.  I still think not being able to define methods on ARRAY,HASH,etc, was... well, closed off one rich direction for language evolution.

[23:48] *** Aankhen`` joined
[23:48] <tene> putter: explain more?

[23:49] <moritz> putter: can you at least inherit from {ARRAY,HASH,etc}?

[23:50] <putter> there were p5 patches to permit   {package HASH;sub foo{} }  {}->foo;  it was (perhaps correctly) thought this would cost more in bugs and confusion than it was worth.

[23:52] <wolverian> I think it's a pretty universal sentiment that tie() was not the right solution either :)

[23:52] <moritz> but still a clean interface allowing just that would be cool ;)

[23:52] <putter> basically it might have permitted rubyesque "everything is an object" style.

[23:52] *** weinig|bbl is now known as weinig

[23:54] <putter> moritz: re "inherit from ARRAY, HASH", I don't believe so.  I believe you have to use tiearray,etc, and annoying tie games.

[23:54] *** TimToady_ joined
[23:55] <putter> :)

[23:59] <moritz> well, time for bed ;)

[23:59] <TimToady_> putter: I certainly wouldn't stop anyone from adding a (?p6:...) to p5...  :)
