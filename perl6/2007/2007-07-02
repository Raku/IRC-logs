[14:54] <TimToady> the statement_control category is too useful to lose, I think

[15:04] <TimToady> Aankhen``: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/unify.html for more thoughts on that.  Perl 6 probably has most of the primitives to emulate Erlang itslef by now; lemme know if you see any missing

[15:42] <TimToady> haven't read those lately, but from my recollection the underbelly of parrot was also all async, so it should probably mesh okay eventually

[15:42] <[particle]> for parrot 1.0, the async and sync implementations will be separate (to get it out the door)

[15:42] <TimToady> s/was/was eventually intended to be/

[15:42] <[particle]> eventually we expect to converge implementations

[15:43] <TimToady> a sync impl can really gum up the works for an async usage, though

[15:44] *** cmarcelo_ is now known as cmarcelo

[15:44] <moritz> diakopter: re diff link, why don't you use /changeset/$revision as link target? I like that one more

[15:44] <[particle]> perhaps perl6 will only use the parrot async model then

[15:44] <moritz> colored diffs and all ;)

[15:44] <TimToady> could be, though calling into another language could then also gum up the works...

[15:45] <[particle]> yep, that's what i was thinking.

[15:45] <diakopter> moritz: i agree, yeah... the SVN::Web one, while faster, is a few years behind trac for the intra-line distinctions.

[15:46] <TimToady> basically, parrot needs a similar layered approach eventually

[15:46] <[particle]> async design hasn't been fleshed out, i think we're waiting to see what the perl 6 design looks like. i hope you're not waiting on us :)

[15:46] <TimToady> that paper pretty much is what I'm aiming at

[15:46] <[particle]> great. that's what we figured, and we're aiming there too

[15:46] <TimToady> though of course we won't call the transaction controller a "monad"

[15:46] <TimToady> that would be scary

[15:47] * diakopter is terrorized

[15:47] <moritz> monads--

[15:47] <TimToady> monads are wonderful in isolation.  it's when they start ganging up on you...

[15:47] * [particle] smokes out the monad extremists and hunts them down

[15:48] <TimToady> sort of a distributed denial of stupidity attack

[15:48] * moritz only waits for the day where haskell programmers write 'use pure; use monads;' at the top of ever p6 program ;)

[15:48] <moritz> s/ever/every/

[15:49] <TimToady> well, we're not so far from being able to allow self-enforced single-assignment style, at least

[18:51] <Juerd> And am looking for testimonials. Would you please write some for me?

[18:51] <kolibrie> that's the site I used!

[18:51] <kolibrie> took me a week

[18:51] <Juerd> It'd be great if it included when and how you learned it, and what the benefits are for you

[18:51] <Juerd> A paragraph, perhaps two, suffices 

[18:51] <kolibrie> Juerd: I'll write something up in the next day or two

[18:52] <Juerd> Perfect; thanks

[18:52] <Juerd> [particle]: You too? :)

[18:52] <[particle]> why not?

[18:52] <Juerd> I wouldn't know :)

[19:03] *** |Jedai| is now known as jedai

[19:33] <jkr> Ahoy

[19:33] <kolibrie> fglock_: looks okay to me.  pretty much the same as last week, except you added the Grammar4 and changed the variable names

[19:33] *** flummox joined
[19:34] <jkr> I bet you hear that very often, but how complete is pugs? :)

[19:34] <fglock_> kolibrie: last week's version had trouble with recursive regexes

[19:35] <qmole> jkr: perfectly usable for playing with, why not try it out? :)

[19:36] <kolibrie> fglock_: I see you have a bit for 5.10 - you plan to generate the code based on what version of Perl is being run?

[19:36] <jkr> qmole: I'm already compiling, I just wondered if it makes sense to learn P6 now or if there'll be more significiant changes

[19:36] <fglock_> kolibrie: the previous Grammar4 didn't work; this one should be faster too

[19:36] <fglock_> re 5.10 - yes

[19:37] * kolibrie likes when it works, and faster

[19:40] <qmole> jkr: pugs and the spec are still evolving, but i'm not expecting it to look *much* different when it's done

[19:40] <qmole> and pugs adds a load of crazy extras too

[19:41] <qmole> like loading haskell and java modules

[19:41] <qmole> heh

[19:41] <jkr> Eeek

[19:41] <jkr> :D

[19:41] <qmole> but it's fun

[19:41] <jkr> I don't know Haskell and I don't want to know Java :)

[19:42] <qmole> ah, perl5 then?

[19:43] <jkr> Yay :)

[19:43] <jkr> But actually I already have a Perl 5 interpreter :)

[19:44] <jkr> I just want to learn P6

[19:44] <qmole> cool. you should find it easy to pick up

[19:44] <qmole> most things do what you expect

[19:45] <jkr> Hmm, I read some of those P5->P6 papers and I found a lot of things that just look completely weird to me 

[19:45] <qmole> my favourite part of trying pugs after p5 was threading

[19:46] <qmole> it was like, "aaahhhhhhhh"

[19:46] <jkr> Is threading already implemented in pugs?

[19:47] <jkr> And why have all the operators been changed? :(

[19:47] <qmole> hm, looked like it. certainly did everything i wanted t=it to

[19:47] <qmole> the new operators are cool

[19:47] <jkr> How is $cond ?? $foo !! $bar any better than $cond ? $foo : $bar?

[19:47] <jkr> And ~ -> ~~, . -> ~, ...

[19:48] <jkr> It just makes it harder to switch from P5 to P6, but not the language clearer

[19:48] <qmole> that's worth it for . instead of ->

[19:48] <jkr> Ah

[19:48] <jkr> Now I got it :)

[19:48] <jkr> But what about the rest?

[19:48] <qmole> as for ?:, i cant remember, i think that meant something else

[19:49] <jkr> $x = $cond ?? $true !! $false;  $x = $cond ? $true : $false;

[19:50] *** flummox left
[19:50] <jkr> 'http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2007/05/10/everyday-perl-6.html?page=2'

[19:51] <jkr> I think I'll miss the old operators for a long long time :(

[19:51] <qmole> it's because ? and : are used for other things i think

[19:52] <qmole> they've all been changed for a reason

[19:52] <jkr> Hehe, I hoped so :)

[19:52] <thoughtpolice> jkr: read the apocalypses for rationale

[19:52] <qmole> have faith :)

[19:52] <thoughtpolice> they're your best bet as to figure what's changed and why (in detail)

[19:52] <thoughtpolice> or you could just ask TimToady I suppose

[19:53] <jkr> But I believe there could be better symbols for operators be chosen

[19:53] * qmole wonders how you write ~~ in perl6 now

[19:53] <jkr> See, changing -> to ., then changing . to ~ because of the new ., and then changing ~ to ~~ because of the old ~ ...

[19:53] <qmole> not that it was particularly good practise to do so in p5

[19:54] <[particle]> qmole: ~~ is spelled ~~

[19:54] <jkr> Why not change . to _ and leave the rest as it is?

[19:55] <[particle]> jkr: the operators are now more easily understood by knowing the rules of forming them, instead of memorizing which does what.

[19:55] <jkr> There are rules for operator symbols?

[19:55] <[particle]> let me find you the correct synopsis describing it...

[19:56] <jkr> That'd be great :)

[19:56] <[particle]> it's either S02 or S03. checking now

[19:57] <jkr> Hmm, seems like pugs will compile forever

[19:57] <[particle]> S03?

[19:57] <jkr> 11 of 109

[19:57] <[particle]> feh. wish the bots understood that.

[19:58] <qmole> i meant prefix ~~ as in ~~localtime

[19:59] * qmole assumes pugs doesnt let you do that

[20:00] <jkr> Is there a good book or tutorial for P6?

[20:01] <[particle]> jkr: sorry, my internet was broken. look here http://perlcabal.org/syn/ at S03

[20:01] *** dalekbot joined
[20:01] *** buu sets mode: +o dalekbot

[20:02] <qmole> jkr: there's no one place, but the specs/examples/tests in the pugs tree should get you started

[20:03] <jkr> Uhm

[20:03] <jkr> . <-- What's that?

[20:03] <[particle]> qmole: '~~localtime' is forcing scalar context. it's the same as 'scalar localtime' but more obfuscated

[20:04] <BooK> or golfed

[20:04] <[particle]> jkr: it calls the method if it exists

[20:04] <[particle]> @object.?meth(@args) # see S12

[20:05] <[particle]> er... @object>>.?meth(@args)

[20:05] <jkr> I don't even know how to produce those characters on my keyboard

[20:05] <[particle]> you mean the pointy french quote?

[20:05] <qmole> [particle]: yeah :) how do you bitwise negate in p6?

[20:05] <jkr> Yup

[20:05] * qmole will miss the worm operator

[20:05] <[particle]> there's an ascii version nicknamed 'texas quotes' << >>

[20:06] <jkr> Ah

[20:06] <[particle]> prefix:~^ is bitwise negation

[20:06] <[particle]> ~^localtime

[20:06] *** Schwern joined
[20:07] <[particle]> er, make that ~^~^localtime

[20:07] <qmole> haha

[20:07] <[particle]> but it's better to force string context

[20:07] <lidden>  if you have an AltGr key AltGr-z and AltGr-x works

[20:07] <[particle]> ~localtime

[20:07] <qmole> no way, that's even cooler than ~~localtime

[20:07] * qmole tells his coworkers

[20:09] <jkr> lidden: Not for me

[20:09] <[particle]> but, hrm, you'll probably have to force string context anyway after you've negated it twice

[20:09] *** isaacd__ joined
[20:10] <qmole> .. with ~~ perhaps

[20:11] <silug> so i know this isn't the right place, but you all seem to be a reasonable bunch...  i have an opinion question.

[20:12] *** mr_ank joined
[20:12] <offby1> opinions are like iPods -- everyone has one, and they all stink

[20:12] <silug> do any of you see a problem with fedora splitting up thier perl package?  in other words, core perl would mostly be in the "perl" package, but there would also be some sub-packages for ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Test::More, stuff like that

[20:13] <offby1> for some value of "iPod"

[20:13] <thoughtpolice> :( i love my ipod

[20:13] <REPLeffect> For the record.  Not everyone has an ipod :-)

[20:13] <offby1> thoughtpolice: well, I said 'iPod' because it was a substitute for another word, and it has the right number of syllables and the correct stress

[20:13] <silug> so normal scripts would usually Just Work, but "development" stuff would require installing some extra packages

[20:13] <fglock_> I don't have an iPod, but I have problems with my MacBook

[20:14] <REPLeffect> my dad always uses "opinions are like noses"

[20:14] <REPLeffect> when in mixed company :-)

[20:14] <thoughtpolice> i would take a macbook. my sister got one for free. :(

[20:14] <offby1> REPLeffect: that does work.

[20:14] <REPLeffect> and it's another body part.  Hehe.

[20:15] <offby1> REPLeffect: but then he must say "and they all smell", rather than "and they all stink"

[20:15] <fglock_> silug: more or less the same problem with debian; I find it annoying

[20:15] <offby1> "My dog has no nose!"   "Really?  How does she smell?"   "Just awful!"

[20:15] <offby1> haw hwa

[20:15] <REPLeffect> his version is "opinions are like noses, everyone's got one".

[20:15] *** unobe is now known as unobe_away

[20:15] <REPLeffect> never used the "stinks" part

[20:16] <silug> fglock_: but does debian have cool module auto-dependency stuff happening in the background?

[20:16] <REPLeffect> offby1: there are no new jokes, just new audiences :-)

[20:16] <silug> rpm "knows" what modules a package provides/requires without any manual intervention

[20:17] <wolverian> silug, perl modules? no. dpkg doesn't parse perl.

[20:17] <wolverian> (unfortunately, I suppose.. :)

[20:17] <silug> rpm has a script that badly parses perl to determine dependencies, but it does work most of the time

[20:17] <thoughtpolice> silug: isn't that available in just about every major linux package management system? (apt, portage, pacman, etc.)

[20:18] <wolverian> thoughtpolice, no. they generally are concerned only with native packages, not perl's.

[20:18] <wolverian> thoughtpolice, of course, perl modules provided in e.g. apt packages have manually determined dependencies.

[20:19] <silug> thoughtpolice: rpm seems to rely less on the packager specifying dependencies and more on automagically figuring them out

[20:19] <silug> (as a packager, i only have to worry about the ones rpm misses)

[20:21] *** daxim is now known as daxim_

[20:21] <silug> anyway, there's some precedence for splitting big packages up so that development tools aren't required for the base package

[20:22] <silug> obviously there's some reluctance to do this to perl, since that's not the way we've done it for years

[20:22] <pugs_svnbot> r16793 | fglock++ | trunk:

[20:22] <pugs_svnbot> : [kp6] added KP6::Visitor::EmitPerl5Regex.pm placeholder

[20:22] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/16793

[20:22] <silug> but it is probably the right thing to do, in my opinion.

[20:23] <silug> then again, i've also resisted some changes that break previous behavior with the justification that we can fix it in our perl 6 packages.  :)

[20:23] <fglock_> I wonder how hard it would be to make a package for v6.pm

[20:23] <silug> i'm working on it

[20:23] <silug> (for fedora, obviously)

[20:25] <silug> sort of, at least.  i've mostly been concentrating on pugs.  the hard part is getting all the paths right.  we really want /usr/share/perl6 for arch-independent stuff, /usr/lib{,64}/perl6 for arch-dependent stuff, plus the vendor_perl/site_perl split in /usr and /usr/local respectively.

[20:25] <silug> that doesn't appear to currently be supported in pugs

[20:25] <silug> but it is on my list of things to do...

[20:26] *** bonesss joined
[20:26] <fglock_> silug: I'm also looking for opinions - on how we should implement 'use' (perl6 supports specifying package versions)

[20:27] <silug> that's going to make packaging even more fun.

[20:27] <fglock_> silug: the files in /debian might give you some start point

[20:27] <silug> do you just look for everything that can satisfy the dependency in @INC, then pick the one that matches the version?

[20:27] <silug> or do you actually have to handle multiple versions installed to the same area in the filesystem?

[20:28] <fglock_> silug: you have to handle multiple versions

[20:29] <silug> so how's that going to work?  is the version appended to the filename or something?

[20:29] <fglock_> otoh, 'use' is compile-time, so you have the option to link statically for distribution

[20:29] <fglock_> silug: not specified yet

[20:29] <silug> ick

[20:30] <spinclad> 9~zx

[20:30] <fglock_> linux distros would probably provide examples of what works or not

[20:31] <fglock_> silug: are you going to YAPC::EU?

[20:31] <wolverian> I wonder how sane cabal's design is in that respect

[20:31] <silug> fglock_: no, i'm in the middle of .us

[20:32] <silug> and i'm starting to regret not making it to YAPC::NA

[20:33] <fglock_> silug: how about (re)starting a discussion in the p6 mailing list

[20:33] *** Schwern joined
[20:36] <silug> fglock_: i'm just starting to work on this stuff again after some number of months.  i need to get back up to speed on everything before i post about random stuff.

[20:36] <silug> it's one thing looking like an idiot on irc...  ;)

[20:37] <fglock_> you can start with "what's the plan so far?"

[23:22] <SamB> TimToady: I'd totally go

[23:22] <SamB> on one of the PDP-1 demonstration days

[23:22] <TimToady> Oh, I've been as a viewer; I mean as an exhibit.

[23:22] <SamB> ah

[23:22] <SamB> I didn't know you were a computer

[23:23] <TimToady> It was funny to see an Amiga 1000 up on the shelf, and realize I have one current *running* at home...

[23:23] <TimToady> *currently

[23:24] <TimToady> well, maybe not since the last powerfail...

[23:25] <SamB> it isn't so strange

[23:25] <SamB> most of the exhibits could still be running at people's homes, if the people hadn't thrown them out

[23:25] <SamB> if they ever were home computers, I mean ;-)

[23:25] * SamB is guessing

[23:26] <TimToady> well, I've known people who run PDP-11 in their garage...

[23:26] <SamB> by that, I mean I don't actually know any of their exhibits besides the PDP-1...

[23:31] <Juerd> I wonder what percentage of the exhibits in that museum supports ASCII :)

[23:32] <TimToady> by count or by weight?

[23:35] <Juerd> TimToady: Heh. Count :)

[23:35] <Juerd> By weight probably no more than 4% :)

[23:36] <Juerd> Every time I see a sort { }, or use one myself, I want Perl 6.  sort has this effect more than any other operator.

[23:36] <Juerd> .=sort is cool too.
