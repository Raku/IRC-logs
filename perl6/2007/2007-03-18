Each time pugs compiles my firewall sees it as a new program and asks if it is ok to let it open a socket (one of the http tests).  I wasn't paying attention since it never asks that quickly.

[00:57] *** neonse left
[01:10] <Limbic_Region> allbery_b - out of curiosity, is use of a computer prohibited during shabbat?

[01:10] <allbery_b> strictly speaking, yes

[01:11] <allbery_b> but (a) not fully converted yet so forbidden to fully practice; (b) Reform, so it's all up in the air anyway (but I do severeley restrict what I do) (c) may have to change jobs to get ouyt of some 24x7 stuff that requires me to be online anyway (so I might as well hang out and do non-"creative" stuff)

[01:12] <Limbic_Region> allbery_b - it seems to me that avoiding the things that should (strictly speaking) be avoided is more work than doing the things themselves

[01:14] <Limbic_Region> when I was doing a comparative theology study and going to various different houses of worship (multiple faiths) - I found it quite amusing (no offense intended) that folks would turn the tv on to the channel they wanted to watch on Friday for the next day

[01:14] <allbery_b> heh

[01:15] <allbery_b> (tune TV to a channel which is empty except when there's an emergency broadcast.  given Israel's circumstances that's a wise precaution)

[01:15] <allbery_b> "get to a bomb shelter NOW" overrides Shabbat in even the strictest interpretations

[01:21] <Limbic_Region> in any case, your pugs should scream

[01:25] <allbery_b> btw, if you did Shabbat with an MO family, sometime you should try it with a traditional or Chasidic Orthodox family.  it is an experience.

[01:25] <avar> moritz: re p5->p6, seen the MAD stuff in perl 5.10? That's what larry was working on for that

[01:26] <allbery_b> the restrictions can be treated as restrictions, or they can be treated as what they're spooosed to be:  a description of how to wall away the ugliness of life and just *be*, in joy, for a day

[01:27] *** weinig is now known as weinig|zZz

[01:27] <Limbic_Region> allbery_b - I understand (and fully agree with) the intent.

[01:28] <allbery_b> the more traditional folks often (not always) manage to pull off the latter --- even if you can't live that way, you should eperience it at least once

[01:29] <Limbic_Region> most of the Jewish folks I know around here aren't even remotely orthodox

[01:31] <avar> this is what you get when you mix national/people's identity with religious identity

[01:33] <Limbic_Region> avar - I didn't mean to imply that they were "non-practicing" Jews.  Only that they were really lax with the rules

[01:33] <Limbic_Region> the same applies to a lot of "Christians" I know

[01:34] <Limbic_Region> avar - but yes, I see your point.

[01:34] <avar> true, but then again the identity of "christian" was really hijacked back in the day

[01:35] <avar> :)

[01:35] <Limbic_Region> in any case, if there is ever a conference or hackathon or what not, I would be very interested in learning more

[01:37] * Limbic_Region is planning on being in SA in the August time frame and is hoping to be at YAPC::Brazil fwiw

[01:38] <allbery_b> Judaism is far from monolithic.  there are nationalistic/non-religious Jews, there are the liberal Jews (Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, Renewal, and various oddities including hybrid Judaism/Buddhism, etc.), and a great many varieties of Orthodoxy (various degrees of Modern Orthodoxy, multiple kinds of Chasidism, Satmar, etc. --- all of this ignoring the Ashkenazic / Sephardic-Mizrachi split)

[01:39] *** buetow joined
[01:39] <allbery_b> and then there's the question of Zionism, which is in many ways orthogonal to the above

[01:41] <Limbic_Region> I try not to get too bogged down in labels.  I think it was Rumi who said they are your coffin.  And some other influential person said that it doesn't matter what group they belong to or what they say but rather by their actions

[01:42] <avar> yay

[01:43] <avar> pugs now fails tests faster!:)

[01:43] <Limbic_Region> yep

[01:43] <Limbic_Region> very fast indeed

[01:43] <Patterner> I should visit Jerusalem again... it's been a long time.

[01:44] <avar> what's there to do there besides being uncomfortbly close to a herd of other worshippers?:)

[01:45] <Limbic_Region> avar - where do live?

[01:46] <avar> Reykjav√≠k, Iceland

[01:46] <Limbic_Region> from what I understand, tourism is a booming business there

[01:46] <avar> hadn't noticed

[01:46] <Limbic_Region> in any case, you should be able to understand the point I am going to try and make

[01:46] <avar> which point?

[01:46] * Limbic_Region is getting to that

[01:46] <avar> I was just wondering what people actually do in Jerusalem:)

[01:47] <avar> those going on a pilgrimage that is

[01:48] <Limbic_Region> growing up here in the US where everyone is politically correct and no one bothers to take a silly thing like religion seriously, it is hard to understand what it means to have true convictions

[01:48] <Limbic_Region> when my daughter is old enough to start making decisions about what, if any, faith she is going to follow - I want her doing so with her eyes wide open

[01:50] * avar still recents his parents for the god/santa claus thing

[01:50] <avar> but meh, back to hacking!

[01:51] <avar> man, Pugs::Compiler::Rule is slooow:)

[01:52] * Limbic_Region 's parents didn't have anything to say on the topic of God but they kept the Santa Claus thing going even after he pulled the fake beard off to all the other kids shock and horror

[01:54] <Patterner> avar: it's warm and full of history

[01:55] <Limbic_Region> avar - according to wikipedia, things to do there not relgious in nature is go to art museum (1 million visitors per year) or go to a soccer game (apparently taken very seriously)

[01:55] <Limbic_Region> P::C::R is pure perl is it not?

[01:56] <avar> yeah, it is

[01:56] <allbery_b> the CW is:  go to Jerusalem for religion or history; go to Tel Aviv/Yaffa for culture

[01:56] <Patterner> Eilat?

[02:01] <allbery_b> somewhere in between.  Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are polar opposites culturally

[02:02] <Patterner> Jerusalem's beaches aren't impressive.

[16:38] <moritz> Limbic_Region: wb ;-)

[16:38] <geoffb> Yeah, I was thinking to myself, "Isn't Limbic back east?"

[16:38] <Limbic_Region> <---- Odenton, MD

[16:38] <moritz> Limbic_Region: which timezone are you in?

[16:38] <Limbic_Region> mortiz - EST

[16:38] <geoffb> For some reason I was thinking Annapolis ....

[16:38] <Limbic_Region> not too far away

[16:39] <geoffb> "Nearest well-known town"?

[16:39] <Limbic_Region> I'm only about 10 minutes from Baltimore - maybe 20

[16:39] <Limbic_Region> in any case, in less than 24 hours I will only have $work as a competitor for my time (Jean and Jasmine will be in the Philippines)

[16:40] <Limbic_Region> so I plan on helping make sure the donation page is up and the word is out

[16:40] <Limbic_Region> then I will probably absorb myself in one of my numerous back burner projects

[16:40] <geoffb> I personally can't wait for audreyt to merge her pad branch.  The stuff she just did helped the smoke a lot, because it's lots of short-running scripts, but it didn't help my stuff at all (one long-running script).  But she says the pad stuff definitely will.

[16:40] <geoffb> Good for you!

[16:41] <geoffb> If you don't mind me asking, why are J&J going to Philippines and you're stuck in MD?

[16:41] <Limbic_Region> long story so I will give you the abridged version

[16:41] <geoffb> Philippines seems like a cool place to go ....

[16:42] <Limbic_Region> last summer I came down with mononucleosis and unexpectedly used vacation time - over the holidays a few months ago, we went to Maine and I used up 3 more weeks.  So in a nutshell - I don't have the time

[16:42] <Limbic_Region> OTOH, I will get to go on a trip by myself later in the year (South America) so it all works out

[16:43] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - is audreyt's pad hackery mostly done or just in research phase?

[16:45] <Limbic_Region> yeah, going from 87 minutes to 148 minutes back down to 30 minutes in 35 revisions is a pretty amazing feat

[16:45] <geoffb> nodnod

[16:45] <Limbic_Region> I saw that geoffb - but that statement didn't imply to me that the refactoring had already taken place

[16:46] <geoffb> I posted some benches a couple days ago that indicated we have a factor of 1000x left to go, we could potentially have that down to 2 seconds.  ;-)

[16:46] <geoffb> (I know, I know, I/O and process forking would get in the way way before that ....)

[16:46] <geoffb> She had said she was pretty far along in her branch, but just not quite finished.

[16:47] <geoffb> Or at least, that's how I understood it.

[16:47] <Limbic_Region> well - she has a propensity for hacking offline and then merging huge checkins

[16:47] <geoffb> something along the lines of "tonight, or if not then, tomorrow" at one point.

[16:47] <geoffb> nodnod

[16:49] *** prly__ joined
[16:49] <geoffb> I'm excited, because if I can get my simple GL stuff running at say 30-50 fps, I can probably get some of my more complex stuff running at 3-5 fps, and that's enough to reasonably do some mass conversion of my main hobby coding.

[16:50] <Limbic_Region> it would also provide an opportunity to do some profiling against a real world app rather than a bunch of mostly contrived examples

[16:51] <Limbic_Region> not that I don't think there are some obvious performance issues already known - but I bet there are some hidden ones too

[17:00] <geoffb> Is pugs in need of long-running benchmarks?

[17:00] <gaal> 'make smoke' is kinda that

[17:00] <Limbic_Region> gaal - real    0m0.453s vs real    0m0.078s

[17:00] <audreyt> we have the mandel.p6 benchmark which is standard for dispatching

[17:00] <lambdabot> audreyt: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[17:00] <gaal> though sure, that's a moving target

[17:01] <audreyt> I did some padhacking tonight; it compiles and runs and fails, oh, 80% of the tests.

[17:01] <gaal> Limbic_Region: what are those numbers?

[17:01] <Limbic_Region> gaal - not sure if you saw my note regarding all_parse.t but that's my fault

[17:01] <geoffb> gaal: yes, but smoke is pretty centered on startup time, not execution of long processes

[17:01] <Limbic_Region> the time for pugs -e1 vs perl -e1 on my platform

[17:01] <gaal> Limbic_Region: no fault at all :)

[17:01] <audreyt> but I need to sleep now -- been sleeping a lot today -- it might be that my liver isn't still quite happy about continuous sleephacking :)

[17:01] <geoffb> audreyt: The glass is 20% full then

[17:01] <gaal> Limbic_Region: in fact, it means there's an extra ~170 or whatever extra prelude startup opportunities, so speedups there are multiplied :)

[17:02] <gaal> geoffb: the regexp tests do take a while

[17:02] <geoffb> audreyt: please, do get some sleep.  We'll see you tonight our time.  :-)

[21:19] <riffraff> oops, sorry aCrtierion could be a Comparator or Keyextractor

[21:19] <riffraff> *Criterion

[21:20] <riffraff> but since I don't know much haskell and pugs' internals I don't know if this situation is actually handled somehow 

[21:21] <riffraff> I just think it is not :)

[21:22] <gaal> write a test? :)

[21:22] <gaal> or check if there is one

[21:23] <riffraff> I know it doesn't work, and I think that there was a test 

[21:23] <riffraff> I'll check

[21:23] *** rashakil_ joined
[21:24] <gaal> t/builtins/lists/sort.t and t/unspecced/sort.t

[21:25] <riffraff> unspecced redefines the whole list.t

[21:25] <gaal> I.... don't really get the one in unspecced

[21:25] <riffraff> but it's broken because of the lack of subtype

[21:25] <riffraff> IIRC

[21:25] <gaal> why it includes an implementation etc.

[21:26] <riffraff> I think it is a leftover from some early iteration of pugs

[21:26] <gaal> not that early, it's from September

[21:28] <gaal> also, ":depends<subset and argument list return signatures>" is bogus

[21:28] <gaal> syntactically

[21:29] <gaal> riffraff: if you have tuits to clean this up and see what can be moved to prelude, that'd be great

[21:29] <riffraff> mh

[21:29] <gaal> bedtime for me.

[21:29] <riffraff> wait because there is more fun

[21:29] <riffraff> ah no sorry go to sleep :)

[21:29] <gaal> let's hear the fun :)

[21:29] <riffraff> g'night

[21:30] <riffraff> therre are a little bit more List.sort or Array.sort definitions all around the tree

[21:30] <riffraff> and all of them are broken due to different reasons, like &join:(Any) not parsing correctly,

[21:30] <riffraff> in one case there is "ues" instead of "use"

[21:31] <gaal> just fix that :)

[21:31] <riffraff> but I don't know why they are there in general :/

[21:31] <riffraff> so back to the iorginal question: sort is supposed to happen in prim.hs or in some List.pm?

[21:32] <gaal> try checking svn/k log and annotate?

[21:32] <riffraff> mh.. good idea

[21:32] <gaal> you mean whether Prim.hs or List.hs?

[21:32] <riffraff> t6hank you :

[21:32] <riffraff> no, I actually mean .pm :)

[21:33] <riffraff> I had this idea that some perl6 libs would be translated to haskell but kept in perl for hackability and portabilty

[21:33] <gaal> oh: well, we don't have 100% convenient separate modules yet (coming soon), so you can just put it in Prelude.pm

[21:33] <riffraff> maybe I just misunderstood 

[21:33] <gaal> you'll see there's lots of stuff like that there

[21:33] <riffraff> ok

[21:33] <gaal> yes, that's reasonable

[21:34] <gaal> as in, "the case"

[21:35] <gaal> basic sort stuff should certainly be built in (either to the backend or to a standard library, that's an implementation detail)

[21:35] <riffraff> true

[21:36] <gaal> if there are things that are more clearly library -- say, that you wouldn't expect to want to pay every time you load pugs if you aren't using it -- then put it in ext/Sort or something

[21:36] <gaal> okay, see you later...

[21:37] <riffraff> thank you again & good sleep

[22:08] <dmpk2k> Is there a nicer way to write "$a = =$*IN;"?

[22:09] <moritz> dmpk2k: you could use $a = $*IN.readline

[22:11] <dmpk2k> Hmm. Well, it's a bit of an improvement over that gobbldygook. Thanks.

[22:13] <dmpk2k> It would be nice if something more readable was aliased to it though. Reading in from console isn't uncommon. :|

[22:15] <riffraff> isn't als =<> the same thing?

[22:16] *** ruoso joined
[22:18] <dmpk2k> That's even better. I think I can live with that.

[22:19] <riffraff> I think I'd go with a "gets"

[22:20] <riffraff> how the hell I can call a routine in a namespace? ::Foo::bar does not work :/

[22:22] <dmpk2k> Is gets() a builtin?

[22:27] <allbery_b> smoke uploaded, fwiw

[22:28] <wolverian> riffraff, that's different. Foo::bar or ::Foo.bar

[22:29] <wolverian> (or Foo.bar)

[22:29] <riffraff> well, my ide was that :: would just get me to the outer scope

[22:29] <riffraff> err.. root namespace 

[22:29] <riffraff> don't knwo the exact name :)

[22:29] <wolverian> no, it's the type sigil :)

[22:30] <riffraff> isn't that ^Foo ?

[22:30] <wolverian> no, that's meta.

[22:30] <riffraff> oh, right

[22:30] <wolverian> or upto

[22:31] <wolverian> it depends on what you want to talk about

[22:34] <riffraff> but then I wonder: why does &(::Foo.bar) actually gets me the routine object?

[22:34] <riffraff> s/./::/

[22:35] <riffraff> mh.. I se that probably is just & that is DWIM

[22:36] <wolverian> but it thinks Foo::bar is a type
