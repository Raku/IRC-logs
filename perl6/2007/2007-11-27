[21:43] <moritz_> dlocaus: pong!

[21:43] <dlocaus> what does p5landish mean? in the context of MOP.pm?

[21:44] <moritz_> I'm not entirely sure... but each p6 object has a p6 way to view at it, and one in the emitted code

[21:45] <moritz_> so I guess p5landish is the "interface" of a p6 objected in the p5 code (either emitted or runtime)

[21:45] <dlocaus> uhrmm.. ok

[21:45] <dlocaus> ok, I can understand that part

[21:45] <dlocaus> but what does "p5landish" mean?

[21:45] <dlocaus> p5 = perl5

[21:45] <dlocaus> landish means ???

[21:45] <moritz_> "belonging to perl 5 land"

[21:46] <Aankhen``> dlocaus: It's basically a Perl 6 -> Perl 5 conversion function, IIRC.

[21:46] *** thoughtpolice joined
[21:47] <Aankhen``> dlocaus: You may have a Perl 6 string object that you want to compare using `eq`, for example. The object itself would be a Perl 6 object, and you'd use p5landish on it to get at the actual string contained within it so you can compare it.
