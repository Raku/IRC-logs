[00:16] <diakopter> @tell Juerd throttled svnbot.pl in its pugs checkout dir... take a look if you want.  very rudimentary.  haven't tested it.

[00:16] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[00:51] <Caelum> anyone know what I need to install in Debian to satisfy dependency pugs-hsregex-any?

[00:56] <allbery_b> I think the build is broken (on some platforms?) --- I got that as well, scanning back revealed it comes with pugs but failed to build

[00:56] <allbery_b> along with HsSyck and a few other things

[00:57] <Caelum> ahh, thank you :)

[00:58] * allbery_b should retry it soonish and send a bug report if it's still b0rked

[07:42] <moritz_> Caelum: pugs should compile

[07:45] * Caelum tries again

[07:45] <moritz_> Caelum: and parrot compiles like a charm on my maschine as well

[07:46] <moritz_> (make realclean; perl Makefile.PL; make)

[07:46] <Caelum> oops, I was using blead instead of regular perl, that's why it didn't work...

[07:47] <Caelum> now it's working

[07:48] <Caelum> err never mind, Setup: cannot satisfy dependency time-any

[07:48] <Caelum> need libghc6-time-dev probably

[07:50] <moritz_> well, you need that ;)

[08:01] <Caelum> now I get "src/Pugs/Embed/Parrot_hsc.h: No such file or directory" but there is a src/Pugs/Embed/Parrot_hsc.h . I guess I should turn off the embedded parrot?

[08:02] <moritz_> you should indeed

[08:05] * Caelum is slowly going through the "programming in haskell" book... hopefully in a few months I could actually become useful
