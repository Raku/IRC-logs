[11:28] <wolverian> reddit's main page is useless

[11:29] <wolverian> programming.reddit is cool

[17:22] <trexy> delurking for a moment to drop an idea into the meme pool ,,,

[17:23] <moritz_> trexy: go ahead ;)

[17:23] <moritz_> without activity #perl6 is quite lonely ;)

[17:23] <trexy> did someone suggest on1 as the name for the next compiler

[17:23] <trexy> ?

[17:24] <trexy> "on1" that is ...

[17:24] <moritz_> not yet

[17:24] <trexy> well ... I suppose I just did

[17:24] <trexy> o(N)

[17:24] <trexy> O(n)

[17:24] <moritz_> ah

[17:24] <trexy> kind of like O notation 

[17:25] <moritz_> but then the name should be o1, no?

[17:25] <trexy> and we all know O(1) is pretty cool

[17:25] <trexy> maybe ... just a thought

[17:25] <ebassi> on+ (like ion notation)? I know I'm bad at punning

[17:26] <moritz_> .oO( but O(1) = O(6) ;-)

[17:27] <trexy> yes ... just a thought

[17:27] <trexy> on1on

[17:27] <moritz_> on1no ;-)

[17:28] <trexy> symmetrical!

[17:29] <trexy> although a bit tricky to say

[17:29] <moritz_> yes ;)

[17:29] <trexy> that was the problem when Prince rebranded

[17:29] <trexy> no one could say his name - except "the artist formally known as Prince"

[17:29] <trexy> which was a bit of a mouthful

[17:30] <moritz_> exPrince ;)

[17:30] <moritz_> but nobody would have recognized that

[17:31] <trexy> purple guy with big hair, white doves and guitar

[17:31] <moritz_> maybe we just need a completely unrelated name

[17:31] <trexy> "distinctiveness" is the no1 feature of a brand

[17:32] <trexy> perl6 will be a distinctive language --- and it needs a power brand to go with it

[17:32] * moritz_ searches for good name in /dev/urandom

[17:32] <trexy> ;-) 

[17:33] <trexy> just don't get 666

[17:33] <trexy> that's taken

[17:34] <moritz_> maybe we should use the name of a chemical element 

[17:34] <moritz_> or a planet

[17:35] <trexy> just for the record I think Perl foundation should have a master brand and all major subprojects should have interlocking sub-brands

[17:35] <trexy> planetperl

[17:36] <trexy> with sub-planets

[17:36] <moritz_> trexy: recorded here: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2007-11-09#i_142119 *SCNR*

[17:36] <lambdabot> Title: IRC log for #perl6, 2007-11-09

[17:36] <trexy> kudos being sucked gravitationally speaking to the master brand

[17:38] <trexy> at the moment perl's branding is leaking goodwill 

[17:40] <trexy> gotta go --- but good luck!

[18:47] <spinclad> i see some signs of 'Garlic' as a rename for On6

[18:51] <moritz_> I'm gathering supporters for that idea ;)

[18:52] <moritz_> anyway, I don't think anything will happen before pmichaud makes clear if he wants to use "onion" as name

[18:52] <spinclad> i'd be happy with Garlic(k)
