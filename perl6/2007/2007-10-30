[14:10] <Tene> pmurias: avar prefixed his greeting to me with someone else's nick, so I did the same to him.

[14:15] <Tene> I started working on a simple mud in p6 on pugs, but pugs dies badly if you try to match p6 grammars inside of threads.

[14:20] <pmurias> fglock: wouldn't it be better to use Scope instead of porting Pad?

[16:01] *** Notrix left
[16:01] <avar> or you could espace the escape character when it occurs

[16:02] <fglock> it worked - but I'll use with some unicode char instead

[16:03] <fglock> avar: the char occurs in plain code inside the regex, it's hard to detect

[16:05] <rgs> fglock: is it in perl 5 or perl 6 code ?

[16:05] <fglock> perl5

[16:05] <fglock> compiled from Perl 6 regex

[16:09] <pugs_svn> r18725 | fglock++ | [kp6-perl5rx] uses chr(0) as the qr() delimiter

[16:10] *** rfordinal left
[16:10] * moritz_ wonders if subversion handles 0 bytes correctly

[16:11] *** drrho left
[16:11] <fglock> moritz_: it could probably be replaced by some high unicode char

[16:11] <rgs> perl 5 will have problems with unicode chars in the source code, whatever that means

[16:11] <rgs> since the lexer isn't utf8 clean

[16:12] <fglock> rgs: ok

[16:12] <TimToady> it should certainly be utf8 clean in strings or regexes...

[16:14] <TimToady> but in any case, trying to guess a delimiter is usually going to be wrong eventually, and it's better to just take a pass and escape it.

[20:50] <FreshCat> one question: why haskell?

[20:50] <Tene> FreshCat: because the people who started it liked haskell.

[20:50] <Tene> Specifically, audreyt.

[20:50] <Tene> Neither parrot nor kp6 are using haskell, though.

[20:51] *** weinig left
[20:51] <FreshCat> yar, parrot is in c

[20:51] <[particle]> actually, audreyt wanted to learn haskell, so started pugs

[20:51] <FreshCat> nice

[21:19] <dlocaus> pmurias: ping?

[21:21] <pugs_svn> r18735 | dlo++ | I have added a lot of documentation to this file.  I do not completely understand how $meta_Class works, however, I believe I have done a good job of documenting a lot of stuff.

[21:25] <fglock> dlocaus: in short, a kp6-perl5 object is a hash with a _dispatch key

[21:26] <fglock> _dispatch points to a sub that knows how to execute methods

[21:26] <fglock> the sub is a "method dispatcher"

[21:27] <fglock> you can construct an object that holds Method objects - this is a Class object

[21:28] <fglock> the method dispatcher in Class knows how to handle inheritance and Roles

[21:37] <pugs_svn> r18736 | fglock++ | [kp6] docs for $::dispatch_VAR

[21:38] <pmurias> dlocaus: pong

[21:38] <dlocaus> fglock: ok, I'll update that.  How is the documentation?

[21:38] <dlocaus> pmurias: hi, I had updated the MOP documentation, and I was hoping you could review it, but I think fglock got there first.

[21:38] <fglock> dlocaus: great!

[21:39] * dlocaus cheers!

[21:41] <fglock> dlocaus: $meta_Method contains the "Class" object for Method

[21:42] <fglock> $::Method contains the "Prototype object" for Method

[21:42] <fglock> which means it is a Method object with value "undef"

[21:44] <fglock> heh - ${$::Method}->{'_isa'}->[0]->{'_isa'}->[0]->{'_value'}->{'methods'}->{'add_role'}->{'_roles'}

[21:45] * dlocaus admits to be confused...

[21:48] <fglock> those pointers are a Data::Dumper artifact - it's much simpler than that

[21:49] <dlocaus> ok.

[21:49] <dlocaus> I'm updating the documentation in regards to the above comments.

[21:49] *** TJCRI left
[21:50] <fglock> the definition of $meta_Method is at line #455, and $::Method is at #507 - that's all of it
