[13:30] <ahmadz> i like this lamddabot

[13:30] <moritz_> ahmadz: I saw it in the repo...

[13:30] <masak> fglock++ # string interpolation

[13:31] <moritz_> ahmadz: how do you parse p6?

[13:31] <ahmadz> im using syntaxhiglighter regexp...

[13:31] <ahmadz> javascript regexp...

[13:31] <ahmadz> sort of a plugin

[13:31] <moritz_> does it hurt?

[13:31] <ahmadz> it is slow

[13:31] <ahmadz> but pretty perl5 like

[13:32] <moritz_> if you want a _real_ test, run STD.pm through it ;-)

[13:32] <ahmadz> 100+ lines is slow

[13:33] <ahmadz> keywords are matched like regexp's so p6 has lots of them... thus it is slower than ruby/python...

[17:15] <ruoso> besides that

[17:15] <ruoso> if you change that to $<digits>

[17:15] <ruoso> it will fail because "digit" is not defined

[17:21] <ruoso> every grammar should inherit the regex grammar

[17:26] <fglock> yes, it is the base grammar

[17:26] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[17:27] <fglock> you can declare the inheritance explicitly for now

[17:27] <ruoso> I think the test is now closer to the real problem

[17:27] <pugs_svnbot> r17764 | ruoso++ | [kp6] more details on the test... now fails just like the grammar

[17:27] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17764 - Pugs - Trac

[17:27] <ruoso> it seems to reproduce the same exact problem that Grammar.pm does

[17:29] <ruoso> the problem is really in token p5

[17:30] <fglock> i don't think you should use token p5 in 6-in-6

[17:30] <ruoso> fglock, it's still not 6-in-6

[17:31] <ruoso> it's just plain kp6

[17:31] <ruoso> I think it's using p5 tokens anyway

[17:31] <ruoso> and that's why it's failing

[17:31] <ruoso> at least it doesn't die in the grammar any more
