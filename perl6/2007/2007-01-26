[14:55] <[particle]> (not that the op isn't implemented) -- if i'm reading that right

[14:56] <allbery_b> yeh.  and ??? is effectively a warn instead of a die IIRC

[15:08] <avar> [particle]: http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S06.html

[15:08] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 6: Subroutines - perl6:

[15:08] <avar> [particle]: skip to "yadayadayada"

[15:08] <avar> I was wondering what the semantics of it were, it can probably be parsed as an expression

[15:09] <[particle]> oh, geez, right. ... only returns false

[15:09] <[particle]> as i see it, each one throws an exception

[15:09] <[particle]> the ... exception is caught and returns false

[15:10] <[particle]> ??? is caught and warns

[15:10] <[particle]> !!! is caught and dies

[15:10] <[particle]> and, yes, i think expression is a good way to parse

[19:41] <{e3}> i am here!!

[19:42] <rindolf> Hi {e3} 

[19:42] <rindolf> {e3}: what's up?

[19:44] <{e3}> not too much. whassup with you rindolf

[19:44] <rindolf> {e3}: I'm fine. Waiting for ABH to voice his opinion about some XML::RSS overhauls I sent him.

[19:44] <rindolf> And without him, I cannot make any progress.

[19:45] <{e3}> wow that is odd, i was looking at XML::RSS yesterday for no good rason

[19:46] <rindolf> {e3}: look at the version inside the svn repository - it's much better.

[19:46] <{e3}> haha nice, i take it that is your version?

[19:49] <{e3}> looks nice, i will have to install now

[19:52] <rindolf> {e3}: it's a version I heavily improved upon.

[19:52] <rindolf> {e3}: ABH also contributed stuff to it.

[19:52] <rindolf> {e3}: he's the CPAN maintainer.

[19:52] <rindolf> {e3}: but I have some other stuff in mind, which I need to see if he agrees with.

[19:53] <{e3}> i would be interested in hearing about the stuff you have in mind cause i was thinking about using this on a site

[19:54] <rindolf> {e3}: well, they are refactorings:

[19:56] <rindolf> {e3}: 1. Make the ending outer tags (</channel> , </item>, </image>, etc.) have consistent behaviour across all tags and RSS versions. At the moment they sometime end with \n\n and more rarely with \n.

[19:56] <rindolf> {e3}: 2. Get rid of the AUTOLOAD method and replace it with some accessors.

[19:57] <{e3}> cool, that would be sweet

[19:58] <rindolf> {e3}: <<<  I've been thinking of converting each version to its own class, and using the "Replace Conditional with Polymorphism" refactoring: >>>

[19:58] <rindolf> {e3}: 4. I've been thinking of conerting the XML::Parser callbacks to be

[19:58] <rindolf> closures, which will in turn call methods of the XML::RSS instance.

[19:58] <rindolf> {e3}: create a class for every top-level tag that will handle the tag opening and specific generation functions, and also handle the rdf:about and rdf:resource stuff for RSS 1.0?

[19:59] <rindolf> Ask is living in Los Angeles, right?

[20:03] <{e3}> sounds like they are all very good ideas. i am not sure i thinks so
