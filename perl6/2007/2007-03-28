[05:41] <xinming> Heard from one of my friends which likes python. He said Python is already self-hosting, Is it right? *_*

[05:42] * QtPlatypus has heard words to that effect.

[05:42] <offby1> !!

[05:42] *** tokuhirom is now known as toku_away

[05:42] <offby1> self-hosting in that the python interpreter is written in python?  That's hard to believe

[05:43] <Aankhen``> There are a number of Python implementations...

[05:43] <Aankhen``> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy

[05:43] <offby1> and as far as I know nobody actually uses any of them except the standard C one

[05:46] <offby1> "use" or "play with"?

[05:46] <offby1> i.e., do they use it to get real work done?  ("Real Work" here doesn't include developing jython.)

[05:46] <revdiablo> Yes

[05:47] <revdiablo> I know someone who used it a lot, for real stuff

[05:47] <offby1> huh.

[05:47] <offby1> I stand corrected.

[05:47] <revdiablo> So that's 1 out of 5 billion

[05:47] <revdiablo> ;)

[05:47] <offby1> :-)

[05:47] <offby1> I was about to say.

[05:48] <xinming> Pypy can already pass 98% test suite for CPython.

[05:48] <xinming> http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-1.0.0.html

[05:49] <xinming> Come on... Pugs... :-)

[05:49] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[05:50] <offby1> xinming: but again, the question is: does anyone actually use it?

[05:52] <Aankhen``> TBH, I never quite understood the concept of self-hosting.  What are the benefits?

[05:52] <xinming> offby1: Well... No one use it currently doesn't mean It's useless.

[05:52] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: To attain sentience? Take over the world?

[05:53] <xinming> Aankhen``: If a language can be written by itself, then, we when we need to add feature to a language. It's easier and many more good features.

[05:53] <xinming> Aankhen``: eg. Perl 5 is written in C, and for now, It's very hard to extend the interpreter.

[05:53] <revdiablo> Programmers who use the language can eat their own dog food by writing the compiler/interpreter for that language?

[05:53] <offby1> xinming: it doesn't _mean_ it's useless but it does make a fella wonder 

[05:56] <xinming> If Pypy can be used in production. I was a bit afraid of that python will defeat perl. >_<

[05:56] <xinming> Maybe I'm wrong,

[05:57] <Aankhen``> xinming: But the underlying language is still another one, so don't you have to replicate the changes there?

[05:59] <xinming> Aankhen``: ???

[06:00] <Aankhen``> I mean, let's say Perl 6 A is written in Perl6 B.  Perl6 B is still written in another language, isn't it?  And as such, wouldn't any changes to Perl6 A still need to be translated into the language Perl 6 B is written in?

[06:00] <xinming> Aankhen``: Read the http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html  The testing suite is from CPython.

[06:01] <lambdabot> Title: PyPy[getting-started]

[06:01] <xinming> Aankhen``: No, We just need to translate Perl 6 into any other language we like, And run perl 6 on top of that.

[06:02] <xinming> Aankhen``: It's a bit hard to understand at first. :-)

[06:02] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: I see what you mean, if the language changes and the interpreter is written to the old language, then it is no longer self hosting?

[06:02] <Aankhen``> revdiablo: That's it, yes.

[06:02] <xinming> Aankhen``: we need a language to bootstrap perl 6, eg, currently, pugs.

[06:02] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: Features can be added without fundamentally changing the language, though

[06:03] <xinming> Aankhen``: hmm, well, I'm wrong, not language, a compiler.

[06:03] <Aankhen``> revdiablo: Okay, but aren't you still doing double the work? :-S

[06:04] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: No?

[06:04] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: You feed the interpreter's code into itself

[06:04] <Aankhen``> Oh, I see.

[06:04] <Aankhen``> That's probably the critical step I was missing.

[06:05] <Aankhen``> Ah, duh... I even read it at least five times till date in the Wikipedia article, but it never sunk in.

[06:06] <Aankhen``> s/sunk/sank/

[06:07] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: Actually, I should have said compiler. There has to be a compiler that can compile the perl6 code into something else that can run independently.

[06:08] * Aankhen`` nods.

[06:08] <revdiablo> So, perl 6 compiler written in perl 6 compiles its own perl 6 code into parrot bytecode, for instance

[06:08] <Tene> Or, alternately, we could just built a cpu that can run Perl 6 code natively.

[06:08] <Aankhen``> After you've got that first version done, you don't actually need an external compiler any more, right?

[06:08] *** Debolaz2 joined
[06:08] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: That's the idea, yeah

[06:09] <Aankhen``> Awesome.

[06:09] <revdiablo> Aankhen``: Consider C compilers written in C

[06:09] <Aankhen``> Thanks for the explanation.  I've been wondering about that for a while.

[09:29] <baest> is it possible in p6 to use AOP? If the problem was to log when a certain method was called. I wonder if the solution for that would be to use a role with that method, in that role method print out the time of the method call and call the non-role version of the same method.

[19:53] <moritz> perl 6 - the only language that forces you to be happy ;-)

[19:53] <allbery_b> perl6 paranoia?

[19:54] <moritz> the Big Brother is written in p6 of course ;)

[19:54] <allbery_b> you will be happy or you will be used as regexp buffer?

[19:54] <moritz> allbery_b: no, "you will be matched" ;)

[19:56] <offby1> Why do the synopses have a "Last Modified:" field, which presumably must be manually updated,instead of using the Subversion "Date" keyword?

[20:06] <offby1> ?

[20:06] <offby1> sometimes magic can be good.

[20:06] <offby1> I suppose if nobody's ever made a mistake with those "Last Modified" fields, or if such a mistake isn't a problem, then editing it manually is fine.  But it just seems Wrong.

[20:07] <moritz> offby1: that was supposed to be ironic ;)

[20:07] <offby1> *whew*

[20:07] <offby1> wasn't sure :-)

[20:10] <jrockway> wouldn't modifying the last-modified field be a modification?

[20:10] <jrockway> and that gets recursive quickly :)

[20:11] <moritz> jrockway: modifying last-modfied and other things for an atom operation together ;)

[20:11] <moritz> jrockway: encapsulated in SVN commits ;)

[20:12] <jrockway> svn is clever about $Date$

[20:12] <jrockway> it updates it when you check it out based on the log

[20:12] <jrockway> so technically it's not a modification :)
