[01:06] <DarkWolf84> I had problems with token/rule/regex

[01:08] <DarkWolf84> wolverian, I think that only regex has backtracking

[01:08] <wolverian> I think only tokens don't :)

[01:09] <wolverian> (and anything with :ratchet)

[01:09] <wolverian> oh, wait. rule implies :ratchet too.

[01:10] <DarkWolf84> rules have space converting

[01:10] <wolverian> right

[01:11] <DarkWolf84> thats the difference between token and rule

[01:11] <DarkWolf84> I don't got all the stuff in kp6

[01:13] <DarkWolf84> some private keys are not defined at the begining and the class is not inherited

[19:00] <moritz_> well, here ;)

[19:00] <ggoebel> I see stub links for mp6 and kp6 at http://dev.pugscode.org/wiki/ should these point to http://www.pugscode.org/kp6.html? 

[19:01] <moritz_> that would be a good idea, yes

[19:02] <ggoebel> It seems the documentation for the various implementations for perl6, the spec, etc. are spread on multiple sites. Many of which are out of date.

[19:03] <moritz_> yes... hacking real code is much more fun than writing html pages about it :)

[19:03] *** lambdabot joined
[19:03] <moritz_> that's why you should always ask on IRC if something doesn't match ;)

[19:04] <ggoebel> well I'm not sure I'm up to hacking it. Seems like it'd take more tuits than I have just to grok what I'd need to know in order to add anything of value.

[19:04] <moritz_> fact is that the language spec is the most important document for the "end user", everything else is implementation dependent

[19:05] <pmurias> you can look at t/kp6 to see what's implemented

[19:05] <ggoebel> Okay I'll update the wiki... how do I get a trac login to dev.pugscode.org?

[19:06] <moritz_> you need a commit bit

[19:06] <moritz_> if you don't have one, /msg me your email address and your desired nick

[19:07] <ggoebel> Hacking may be more fun, but writing about it can make it easier for others to join in the fun

[19:07] <moritz_> or just write it here, the logging bot has anti spam features

[19:07] <moritz_> btw you have to be registered with freenode to be able to /msg :(

[19:08] <ggoebel> MSG moritz_ did this work?

[19:08] <moritz_> diakopter, Juerd, TimToady, any other feather admins: trac doesn't respond, could you please restart it?

[19:09] <moritz_> ggoebel: no, that was public

[19:13] <ggoebel> is there any list of the bots which are running and what they're good for?

[19:13] *** took` left
[19:14] <pmurias> SLAVES?

[19:15] <moritz_> pmurias: SLAVES are only the bot maintainers

[19:15] <moritz_> the bot 'test' logs for irc.pugscode.org

[19:16] <moritz_> exp_evalbot executes perl 6 via pugs, kp6, nqp, etc ;)

[19:16] <moritz_> buubot evals p5 code and has many other plugins

[19:16] <moritz_> pugs_svn echos the commit messages of the pugs repository

[19:17] <moritz_> lambdabot can @google, record @messages etc

[19:17] <moritz_> any important bot that I forogt?

[19:47] *** took` joined
[19:51] <ggoebel> the readme (http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/README) indicates that v6-MiniPerl6, v6-KindaPerl6, and yap6 are active subprojects. Looks like v6-Onion is missing from the list... and that v6-MiniPerl6-JVM might be stalled. 

[19:51] <lambdabot> Title: /v6/README - Pugs - Trac

[19:52] <moritz_> you're right about v6-mp6-JVM

[20:01] <ggoebel> In http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/docs/kp6.jpg created back on 2007-04-05, "Onion" shown as Perl6 on Parrot. Was this foresight or is this a different Onion?

[20:01] <lambdabot> Title: /v6/docs/kp6.jpg - Pugs - Trac

[20:02] <moritz_> ggoebel: that's a differnt Onion - pmichaud++ wanted to rename Perl6 on Parrot to "Onion", but didn't do it so far

[20:02] <moritz_> but since perl's symbol is an onion, that's not so hard to predict ;)

[20:03] <PerlJam> Though it looks more like garlic than onion in some renderings.

[20:03] <moritz_> maybe we should rename it to 'garlic', then ;)

[20:04] <PerlJam> I wouldn't be opposed :)

[20:05] <moritz_> /etc/apache2/sites-available/commitbit.pugscode.org only consits of comments :/

[20:07] <allbery_b> shallot?

[20:09] <ggoebel> Allium is the onion genus... which includes shallots, garlic, leeks, chives, etc. Sounds like a new prescription drug...

[20:11] <pmurias> i like garlic as the name

[20:11] <ggoebel> I like garlic too. But not everyone likes that I like garlic...

[20:12] <pmurias> i don't like garlic as food though

[20:12] <ggoebel> How about: Pip?

[20:12] <ggoebel> Perl6-in-Perl6

[20:12] <moritz_> that sounds a bit like 'pimp' :/

[20:12] <PerlJam> And parrot is the pizza with anchoives (php), garlic (perl), pepperoni (python), etc.

[20:13] <ggoebel> and when you talk about emitters, you could talk about laying pipe...

[20:13] <PerlJam> though, on a pizza, perl is more like cheese 

[20:14] *** cognominal_ left
[20:14] <ggoebel> what? it isn't pizza without it?

[20:14] <ggoebel> I need to go back to reading code and documentation.

[20:14] <ggoebel> wanders away...

[20:14] <PerlJam> perl binds everything together just like cheese does for pizza

[20:17] <avar> pip also sounds like that guy in south park cartman loves to beat up:)

[22:09] <mncharity> mostly OLPC flavored.  though just now puzzling over a bottleneck analysis of the p6 project.

[22:15] <mncharity> xmas < impl < design < existence of impl to provide foil for design < impl which passes test suite (is something weaker sufficient?) < {frontend, ast, backend} which pass suite.  Q: Does an ast spec which can cover the suite (including oo) exist yet?  Does a frontend exist which can generate it?  Does a backend exist which can run it?

[22:15] <obra> oh. what are you doing for OLPC?

[22:47] <mncharity> ggoebel: another scary number is the scale.  130 millionish kids born each year, almost all of which at least start primary school.  So, making an poor assumption of homogeneous distribution,  a 1 day project slippage means missing 300 thousand kids.  a week, 2 M.  You need to triple world laptop production just to match the rate of new kids entering school, not even touching the ~1000 M already of school age.
