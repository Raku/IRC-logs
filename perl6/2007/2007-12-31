[08:26] <avar> I'm testing that

[08:53] <avar> the current stuff is running with mp6, can't it run on kp6?

[08:54] <avar> I'm wondering how much faster the kp6-kp6 parser is with the optimization but I'm not able to run it

[08:57] *** aaron_TeeJay joined
[09:04] <pmurias> avar: i haven't timed it but the kp6-kp6 parser seems much faster

[09:05] <pmurias> but the kp6-kp6 visitors are horribly slow

[09:05] <avar> how do you run it?

[09:05] <pmurias> script/kp6-kp6.pl 

[09:06] <pmurias> i have started work on an alterantive perl5 backend Emit::Perl5V6

[09:07] <pmurias> avar: to (re)compile kp6-kp6 you need to pass the KP6_TARGET='KP6-KP6' option to Makefile.pl

[09:12] <avar> $ perl -I compiled/perl5-kp6-kp6/lib script/kp6-kp6.pl

[09:12] <avar> KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl6/Pair.pm did not return a true value at compiled/perl5-kp6-kp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Runtime.pm line 13.

[09:13] <pmurias> avar: did you recompile kp6?

[09:14] <pmurias> KP6_TARGET should be 'KP6-BOOT'

[09:53] <aaron_TeeJay> bah

[09:54] <aaron_TeeJay> naturally pugs requires a newer version of haskell than the one I downloaded and compiled for 48 hours last time I tried pugs

[09:54] <Tene> What version did you use last time?

[09:54] <aaron_TeeJay> 6.6

[09:54] <aaron_TeeJay> now I need 6.6.1

[09:55] <aaron_TeeJay> anybody have recent svn pugs and want to let me know if examples/hanoi works (without // and/or argv) ?

[09:55] <aaron_TeeJay> update http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?tower_of_hanoi if you do

[09:55] <lambdabot> Title: Tower of Hanoi / Perl 6

[09:55] <aaron_TeeJay> thanks

[09:56] *** BinGOs joined
[09:56] <Tene> aaron_TeeJay: works for me

[09:56] <aaron_TeeJay> which svn revision?

[09:56] <aaron_TeeJay> and with // and argv ?

[09:56] <aaron_TeeJay> can you benchmark it too?#

[09:57] <Tene> looks like I have 18224 on that box, but I'm not certain I've recompiled with that version

[09:57] <Tene> Tell me what to run to produce the benchmarking info you want.

[10:00] <aaron_TeeJay> ext/Benchmark/lib/Benchmark.pm

[10:01] <aaron_TeeJay> 1000 iterations of 6 discs?

[10:01] <aaron_TeeJay> which svn revision do you have installed?

[10:02] <Tene> 18224

[10:03] <Tene> aaron_TeeJay: how do you want me to run those 1000 iterations?  modify hanoi.pl or run the existing hanoi.pl 1000 times, with full startup costs, or what?

[10:03] <aaron_TeeJay> modify

[10:04] <aaron_TeeJay> no point benchmarking startup costs

[10:04] <aaron_TeeJay> thanks

[10:04] *** kanru joined

[10:06] <aaron_TeeJay> skip say

[10:07] <aaron_TeeJay> ideally, print to a file instead

[10:07] <aaron_TeeJay> can always improve later

[10:08] <aaron_TeeJay> thanks

[10:10] <pasteling> "Tene" at 166.70.38.237 pasted "hanoi-bench" (13 lines, 200B) at http://sial.org/pbot/29516

[10:11] <aaron_TeeJay> pugs still going

[10:11] <Tene> Yep.

[10:12] <aaron_TeeJay> ouch

[10:12] <Tene> I'll kill it and re-do it, printing the iteration each time.

[10:12] <aaron_TeeJay> try 100 instead

[10:13] <aaron_TeeJay> or even 10

[10:13] <Tene> pugs:

[10:13] <Tene> real    0m22.611s

[10:13] <Tene> user    0m22.384s

[10:13] <Tene> sys     0m0.101s

[10:13] <Tene> parrot:

[10:13] <Tene> user    0m0.694s

[10:13] <Tene> sys     0m0.141s

[10:13] <aaron_TeeJay> how many iterations for pugs?

[10:14] <Tene> 100, both with a 'say' for the iteration number.

[10:14] <aaron_TeeJay> right

[10:14] <Tene> also on completely different boxes

[10:14] <Tene> So not an actual usable comparison

[10:15] <Tene> I had haskell issues compiling pugs on my laptop that I didn't track down.

[10:15] <aaron_TeeJay> thanks

[10:15] <aaron_TeeJay> :)

[10:15] <Tene> No problem.

[10:15] <aaron_TeeJay> at least it gives ballpark figures

[10:15] <Tene> Yeah.

[10:16] <aaron_TeeJay> what kind of machine for pugs vs parrot ?

[10:17] <Tene> pugs: 1ghz, 640M ram

[10:17] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** ␤    Unexpected "ghz"␤    expecting "_", fraction, exponent, term postfix or operator␤    at /tmp/iPdrXKywJB line 1, column 2␤]

[10:17] <aaron_TeeJay> oops :)

[10:17] <Tene> parrot: 1.6ghz, 2G ram

[10:17] <Tene> pugs: [~] <m oo se>

[10:17] <exp_evalbot> RESULT["moose"]

[10:17] <aaron_TeeJay> so the h/w performance wouldn't alone be the cause of the difference of that scale then :)

[10:18] <Tene> Right.

[10:18] <Tene> Oh, right, I'll update parrot on that box and run it there.

[10:18] <aaron_TeeJay> neat

[10:18] <aaron_TeeJay> can you update http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?tower_of_hanoi when you're done

[10:18] * Tene has been up a bit too long.

[10:18] <aaron_TeeJay> don't worry about it then

[10:18] <aaron_TeeJay> :)

[10:18] * aaron_TeeJay ought to do some Work

[10:19] <aaron_TeeJay> i.e. stuff that pays mortgage

[10:19] <Tene> What do you want me to add?

[10:19] <aaron_TeeJay> don't worry about it

[10:19] <aaron_TeeJay> :)

[10:19] <aaron_TeeJay> have benchmarks, machines, code - I think that page is "done"

[10:19] <aaron_TeeJay> people can always add newer benchmarks, etc

[10:20] <aaron_TeeJay> I'll look at doing hilbert curve next weekend

[10:20] <Tene> Oh, you added stuff.  I should try reading.  ;)

[10:20] <aaron_TeeJay> :)

[10:20] *** penk left
[10:21] <Tene> Can you point me to a hilbert impl?

[10:21] <aaron_TeeJay> linked from hilbert page iirc ;)

[10:21] <aaron_TeeJay> but not done in perl6 yet

[10:22] <Tene> Ahh.

[10:22] <aaron_TeeJay> it's implemented in every language :)

[10:22] <aaron_TeeJay> except perl 6 and possibly some obscure assembly

[10:22] <aaron_TeeJay> it's another interesting recursion problem

[10:23] <aaron_TeeJay> but you can add layers of efficiency/complexity

[10:23] <aaron_TeeJay> very much a "solve on paper first" one

[10:23] <aaron_TeeJay> right - work

[10:23] <aaron_TeeJay> laters all

[10:23] <Tene> Or a "steal from the p5 impl" one

[10:23] <aaron_TeeJay> thanks for help

[10:24] <aaron_TeeJay> I wrote the p5 impl :)

[10:24] <Tene> What is it you do for work, btw?

[10:24] <Tene> seeya.

[10:24] <aaron_TeeJay> fuck-off-big online classifieds

[10:24] <aaron_TeeJay> so that even on a sunday morning the site is still being used by dozens of users

[10:24] <Tene> Nice.

[10:24] <aaron_TeeJay> which is annoying for maintainence

[10:25] <aaron_TeeJay> but lots of interesting problems in scaling and high availability

[10:25] <Tene> Rather.

[10:26] <aaron_TeeJay> yes - that's why I took the job

[10:26] <aaron_TeeJay> that and working from home

[20:14] <zev> I'm looking to do some work on perl6.  I've spent some time looking through the existing code, and want to start on some small tasks.  I don't see anything in the perl6 hiveminder group.  Does anyone know of anything smallish that needs working on right now?

[20:15] <[particle]> perl 6 in general, or perl6 the parrot app?

[20:15] <zev> perl6 the parrot app

[20:16] <zev> (or things in parrot or pct that need doing for perl6)

[20:16] <[particle]> hop on over to irc.perl.org#parrot, you're more likely to get answers there. but in general, we need help reorganizing the tests in pugs to align with the synopses

[20:19] <zev> ok.  I'll ask over there

[23:29] <acmoore> OK 1

[23:32] <markstos> Is pugs still alive? http://pugs.blogs.com/ is fairly silent on it, and steam seems to be picking up with the parrot backend.

[23:32] <lambdabot> Title: Pugs

[23:34] *** devogon joined
[23:35] <[particle]> markstos: pugs is all but abandoned, as nobody's made any pugs commits in a long time

[23:36] <markstos> Is the Haskell backend not consided viable, then? I heard Audrey become ill for a while, and that was a factor. 

[23:37] <markstos> I was just starting to learn some Haskell. :)

[23:38] <[particle]> it's viable, as far as i know. just lost steam when audrey got Real Life

[23:38] <[particle]> it's been waiting on a new object model, and nobody's taken up the work of merging audrey's unfinished branch with trunk

[23:39] <[particle]> (by branch i mean svk depot somewhere)

[23:39] <markstos> Ah, sounds like sort of an important and complex blocker, then. 

[23:39] *** thestarslookdown joined
[23:40] <markstos> [particle]: thanks for the update.   Maybe I'll poke at some pugs some once my Haskell gets off the ground.
