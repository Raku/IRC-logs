[05:52] <lidden> TimToady: You said three days ago that that should work. I was about to add a test for it but cant find anything about it in the synopses, so now I am a little confused.

[05:53] <lidden> would C< is("$(my $x = 2) $x", '2 2'); > be a correct test?

[05:53] <TimToady> I believe so

[05:55] <TimToady> likewise is("$(my $x = 2)" ~ $x, '22')

[05:57] <TimToady> in either case it should be adding to the current outer lexical scope

[05:57] <evalbot_r16855> Bool::False

[10:48] <agentzh> avar: are you working on compile_p6grammar?

[10:49] <agentzh> avar: i've got a lot of PCR-related stuff done in the classroom this afternoon and i'm now quite close to getting compile_p6grammar working again :)

[10:51] <agentzh> fglock: i'm thinking about making PCR more p5-ish. i'm going to introduce a "pure p5 mode" for PCR, in which PCR will not try to treat regex actions as Perl 6.

[10:51] <agentzh> fglock: i'm afraid it's a shame for PCR to rely on v6.pm to compile itself.

[10:53] <agentzh> fglock: i believe it's quite simple to get PCR compile a modified version of Rule2.pm merely using itself (without v6.pm, of course)

[10:54] <agentzh> fglock: i'm going to implement Pugs::Compiler::Grammar tomorrow for compiling an updated version of Rule2.pm (which will be Rule2.pm :))

[10:54] <agentzh> s/will be Rule2.pm/will be Rule3.pm/

[17:01] <aharoni> hi

[17:01] <aharoni> is there anything like perldiag for pugs?

[17:01] <Tene> Hi. :)

[17:03] *** gogonkt1 joined
[17:05] <daxim> not yet, wanna write one?

[17:06] <TimToady> 'course, if the diags have to be explained, a good case could be made that the diags are inadequate...

[17:09] <TimToady> and there should probably be an option to add explanatory URLs to diagnostics (language sensitive too)

[17:09] <[particle1> then write a perldoc:// protocol, and a docserv....

[17:10] <aharoni> i'll gladly start writing something.

[17:10] <Juerd> 3. profit?

[17:11] <aharoni> is there some central file in which there's a list of all diag messages?

[17:11] *** lotek_ joined
[17:11] <TimToady> no, it's currently scattered about in the various sources

[17:12] <TimToady> we haven't really I18n'ed it yet

[17:15] <aharoni> OK - where does this come from in the source?

[17:16] <aharoni> (i'm a very green pugs hacker, please be gentle :) )

[17:16] <TimToady> I'd use some kind of a recursive grep to find it

[17:16] <TimToady> it's very likely in src/Pugs though

[17:20] *** dduncan joined
[17:21] <aharoni> i'm sure there's something - the code impressed me with its cleanliness, even though i know little Haskell

[17:21] <diakopter> Juerd: apache2 was using *tons* of ram/cpu (too much even to start some of the svnbots) on feather, so I changed the apache2 logs to rotate daily (they were huge) instead of weekly, and it seems to have helped apache's responsiveness.  now to see if it has helped the ram situation.

[17:22] <TimToady> strange

[17:23] <dduncan> how would a log size affect ram usage?

[17:23] <dduncan> isn't a log just appending to a disk file?

[17:24] <diakopter> I've seen apache get very bogged down when appending to very big (500MBish) log files

[17:24] <diakopter> and that causes apache2 children to be waiting often, which means more children are required to be forked

[17:25] <diakopter> hrm. we need a http log file analyzer. 

[17:28] <diakopter> oh.  here's [one/another reason] why it's slow at the moment - googlebot is grabbing html diffs of every revision of both pugs and parrot.

[19:53] <pmichaud> fglock___: pong

[19:54] <fglock___> pmichaud: I'd like to show you kp6...

[19:55] <pmichaud> fglock___: you mean walk through the code?  will it take long?

[19:56] <fglock___> not really - I'd like to discuss the high level structure

[19:56] <fglock___> hmm - 15 minutes?

[19:57] <pmichaud> okay, sounds great

[19:57] <fglock___> cool

[19:58] <fglock___> this shows kp6 as implemented today: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/docs/kp6.jpg

[19:58] <fglock___> kp6 is p6 compiler written in miniperl6

[19:58] <avar> fglock___: backtracking-recursive-subrule looks nice

[19:58] <fglock___> kp6-on-perl5 contains a runtime written in perl5

[19:58] <fglock___> avar: thanks

[19:59] <avar> fglock___: do you have anything that compiles down to that p5 structure yet?

[19:59] <fglock___> pmichaud: the AST processors are pluggable; you can select what processing is best for each backend

[19:59] <avar> fglock___: talk to pmichaud first:)

[20:00] <fglock___> avar: under kp6, yes - but I'm having problems with the mop right now

[20:01] <fglock___> pmichaud: about the regex engine, the default option is to compile regexes into plain code, using 'substr' and 'eq'

[20:02] <pmichaud> what is "plain code"?

[20:02] <fglock___> but you can choose to use a native lib

[20:02] <fglock___> Perl6 code, which is then recompiled into native code

[20:02] <fglock___> this is how miniperl6 works, too

[20:02] <fglock___> so the regex engine is very portable

[20:02] <pmichaud> so, basically you have a regex engine written in perl 6?

[20:02] <fglock___> but kinda slow

[20:02] *** isaacd__ joined
[20:02] <fglock___> yes

[20:02] <pmichaud> nice

[20:03] <fglock___> in miniperl6

[20:03] <fglock___> it feeds back into the compiler

[20:03] <pmichaud> the regex engine feeds back into which compiler?

[20:03] <fglock___> into kp6

[20:03] <fglock___> it's recursive

[20:04] <pmichaud> I don't quite follow that

[20:04] <fglock___> parser -> regex-parser -> perl6-code -> parser -> ast

[20:04] <fglock___> parser -> regex-parser -> regex-ast -> regex-emitter -> perl6-code -> parser -> ast

[20:05] <pmichaud> the regex parser is kinda like a front end to kp6, then

[20:07] <fglock___> there is an AST processor that takes care of that: it emits the 'regex' nodes to kp6, and reparse into AST again 

[20:07] <fglock___> s/to kp6/to miniperl6/

[20:08] <pmichaud> okay, got it

[20:08] <fglock___> this is the code, just in case: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/lib/KindaPerl6/Visitor/Token.pm

[20:08] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/24p335

[20:09] <avar> fglock___: what files implement the rx parse/rx ast/rx emitter?

[20:11] <fglock___> avar: Kp6::Grammar::Regex does the parse & AST; Visitor::Token is the miniperl6-AST emitter; Visitor::EmitPerl5Regex is the p6rx-on-p5rx emitter

[20:11] <fglock___> we can have a PGE emitter too

[20:12] <pmichaud> ...PGE emitter?

[20:12] <fglock___> pmichaud: the other part of the compiler is the BEGIN processor

[20:12] <fglock___> re PGE - we can call into PGE, from kp6-in-parrot (when it gets ready)

[20:13] <pmichaud> ...but PGE is a regex compiler

[20:13] <pmichaud> so I'm not sure what a 'PGE emitter' would look like

[20:13] <avar> presumably it would stop at the regex-parser step basically and emit PIR needed to call PGE

[20:14] <fglock___> the idea is to replace the kp6 modules with native modules, as much as possible; the "emulation" modules should be optional

[20:14] <fglock___> PGE would replace the kp6 grammar engine, or complement it

[20:15] <pmichaud> okay

[20:15] <fglock___> about the BEGIN processor, it executes some code, and then looks for side-effects

[20:16] <fglock___> the side-effects part is tricky

[20:16] <pmichaud> but I think that would really need to take place at the "Perl 6 AST" stage, rather than as an "emitter"

[20:16] <fglock___> kp6 doesn't make much distinction between an AST-processor and an emitter; they are just part of a "workflow"

[20:17] <pmichaud> or is that the "DSL" section in the middle?

[20:17] <fglock___> there is a single API

[20:17] <pmichaud> "DSL" is "domain specific language"?

[20:17] <fglock___> yes - but I've changed my mind a little, I'm integrating this into the main grammar

[20:18] <fglock___> the DSL-grammar part, that is

[20:18] <fglock___> the DSL-ast processors are plain plugins

[20:20] <pmichaud> okay, got it so far

[20:21] <fglock___> that's it :)

[20:21] <pmichaud> it seems odd that the BEGIN processor is separate from the main compiler

[20:21] <fglock___> it is a module

[20:22] <fglock___> I think the parrot version would likely be implemented in parrot, for efficiency

[20:22] <fglock___> the Perl version uses a complicated Pad scheme

[20:23] <pmichaud> well, my thinking of BEGIN for parrot has been that it would be just a normal part of the compilation process

[20:23] <pmichaud> except at the conclusion of a BEGIN block we go ahead and execute it

[20:24] <pmichaud> (i.e., after parsing a BEGIN block, we go ahead and complete compilation on the block and initiate execution of the code generated by it)

[20:24] <TimToady> at CHECK time you have to have a way of saving a snapshot to start up again for separate compilation

[20:25] <TimToady> fglock___: btw, p6rx-on-p5rx looks okay to me on first glance

[20:25] <fglock___> parrot gives you a lot of control on the pads, but perl needs to do a lot of work to get to the side-effects (the snapshot)

[20:25] <fglock___> TimToady: cool - thanks a lot!

[20:25] <pmichaud> I was thinking the side-effects would be stored in the code generated by the BEGIN block

[20:26] <fglock___> yes, but how do you generate that code?

[20:26] <pmichaud> same way I generate any other sub :-)

[20:26] <pmichaud> or block

[20:26] <TimToady> you mean, capture the side effects of a BEGIN into an INIT?

[20:27] <TimToady> can't just rerun the BEGIN...

[20:27] <fglock___> like:  $a ::= 9; BEGIN { $a := $a + 1 }  -->  runtime:  { $a := 10 }

[20:27] <pmichaud> I hadn't thought about it in terms of BEGIN/CHECK/INIT sequence, so I can't say for sure how that would go

[20:28] *** weinig joined
[20:28] <TimToady> this may be one area where parrot as stayed a bit in the p5ish mode...

[20:28] <TimToady> s/as/has/

[20:28] <pmichaud> indeed, that's one of the challenges at the moment

[20:29] <pmichaud> it's not entirely clear how one can "snapshot" things in Parrot

[20:30] <pmichaud> but, in some ways something like  $a ::= 9;   is already acting as a self-contained "BEGIN" block, in that it's defining something to be done during parsing/compilation

[20:30] <pmichaud> so, that semantic has to be captured in the compiled code as well :-|

[20:30] <fglock___> yes, it does

[20:30] <fglock___> 'use' is also a begin-ish thing

[20:30] <pmichaud> yes, exactly

[20:31] <TimToady> indeed, you have to pretend the compilation is real until CHECK time, where it becomes some kind of freeze/thaw problem for existing data, not just code.

[20:31] <fglock___> kp6 has a 'Pad' module, that can create lexical scopes and inspect them for changes

[20:31] <fglock___> and reemit the changes as code

[20:33] <avar> fglock___: what syntax for regexes does kp6 understand?

[20:33] <avar> it's giving a syntax error for class Main { "foo" ~~ /bar/ }

[20:34] <fglock___> avar: regexes are currently plain methods:  something like - Main.bar( "foo" )

[20:35] <avar> I just want something I can use to test/improve the p5 rx emitter

[20:36] <fglock___> avar: I've got a test here, I'll commit it

[20:36] <avar> thanks

[22:14] <bloonix> .say for <foo bar baz>;

[22:14] <bloonix> fine

[22:14] <Tene> bare .foo is short for $_.foo

[22:14] <TimToady> well, more techinically, when it's not expecting a postfix

[22:14] <TimToady> ?eval for <foo bar baz> {.say}

[22:15] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[foo‚ê§bar‚ê§baz‚ê§] undef

[22:18] <bloonix> for expect a list and loop a condition? mixes are not possible?

[22:18] <Tene> bloonix: ?

[22:19] <bloonix> for ($i=0; $i<5; $i++){ say $i }

[22:19] <bloonix> s/for/loop/ now

[22:19] <Tene> Right, that's named 'loop' in perl

[22:20] <Tene> erm

[22:20] <Tene> in perl 6

[22:21] <bloonix> ;)

[22:21] <PerlJam> Tene: around here, perl is perl 6  :)

[22:21] <thoughtpolice> vroom.

[22:21] <thoughtpolice> how goes the hacking?

[22:24] * TimToady .oO(obviously, too busy hacking to answer)

[22:24] <bloonix> sorry, I'm a bit confused...

[22:24] <bloonix> for $+.keys { .say }

[22:25] <PerlJam> bloonix: me too.

[22:25] <bloonix> $+ = environment

[22:25] <PerlJam> not any more (if it ever was)

[22:25] <bloonix> say $+HOME = /home/bloonix

[22:25] <TimToady> we call them contextual variables now

[22:26] <PerlJam> maybe I should re-read a synopsis or two  :)

[22:26] <PerlJam> TimToady: is $+.keys meaningful?

[22:26] <TimToady> $+ is not a hash

[22:26] <bloonix> in perl 5 is write "print for keys %ENV"

[22:26] <bloonix> s/is/I/

[22:26] <TimToady> $+ is not just for getting to ENV

[22:27] <TimToady> it gets any contextual variable, and has to run up the call stack to find it

[22:27] <TimToady> so it doesn't really know the keys

[22:27] <bloonix> okay

[22:27] <TimToady> the %*ENV array is just the final place to look.

[22:27] <bloonix> for %ENV.keys { .say }

[22:27] <bloonix> ^^

[22:28] <TimToady> have to say %*ENV

[22:28] <TimToady> or import it into your current package

[22:29] <TimToady> both the %*ENV and the .say change are since we started a search-and-destroy mission for wherever the user had to memorize arbitrary lists

[22:29] <Tene> Which arbitrary list was %*ENV?

[22:29] <TimToady> well, originally, in p5, the list of symbols that magically appear in every package.

[22:30] <TimToady> in p6, just the list of auto-imported syms from *

[22:30] <TimToady> we decided the * was worth not autoimporting

[22:30] <Tene> *nod*

[22:30] <TimToady> with .say, the list of functions that happen to default to $_

[22:31] <TimToady> we've also gotten rid of the list regex metachars

[22:31] <TimToady> s/list/list of/

[22:32] <bloonix> I dont understand that:

[22:32] <bloonix> %hash<<foo>>

[22:32] <TimToady> usually just just <foo> there

[22:33] <TimToady> the double angle forms are for interpolating now

[22:33] *** Jmax joined
[22:33] <TimToady> %hash<foo> is the new $hash{foo}

[22:34] <TimToady> the p5 form was always a source of confusion

[22:34] <bloonix> but %hash{foo} is also possible?

[22:34] <TimToady> only if foo is a function of 0 args

[22:35] <TimToady> there is no special autoquoting inside {...} anymore

[22:35] <TimToady> and the <foo> forms can be applied more consistently across the language

[22:36] <bloonix> say %hash{foo}; -> *** No such subroutine: "&foo"

[22:36] <bloonix> okay

[22:37] <bloonix> http://faq.perl-community.de/bin/view/Wissensbasis/Perl6TutorialKapitel3

[22:37] <bloonix> there seems a lot of things older

[22:39] <bloonix> hmmm

[22:40] <bloonix> my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman");

[22:40] <bloonix> say %hash<audrey>;

[22:40] <bloonix> ***Unexpected "<audrey" ...

[22:42] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %hash<audrey>;

[22:42] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:42] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute<audrey>;

[22:42] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[pugs‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:42] <bloonix> arg

[22:43] <TimToady> should have given you a better error message

[22:43] <bloonix> s/%hash/%perl6leute/ :)

[22:44] <bloonix> hmmm %hash{foo} and foo must be a func, but what is %perl6leute{'audrey'} ?

[22:44] <bloonix> ''

[22:44] <thoughtpolice> same thing

[22:44] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute{'audrey'};

[22:44] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[pugs‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:44] <bloonix> seems its the same like %perl6leute<>

[22:45] <TimToady> what version are you running?

[22:45] <bloonix> but why? "" tries to eval it and '' not ?

[22:45] <bloonix> Version: 6.2.13 (r16712)

[22:46] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute{"audrey"};

[22:46] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[pugs‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:46] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute<>;

[22:46] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[audrey	pugsdamian	larry's evil henchmanleo	parrot‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:46] <TimToady> that's taking it as equivalent to:

[22:46] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute{};

[22:46] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[audrey	pugsdamian	larry's evil henchmanleo	parrot‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:47] <TimToady> the <> is not an empty string, but an empty list

[22:47] <TimToady> just as <foo bar> is a list of two elements

[22:47] <TimToady> ?eval my %perl6leute = ('audrey'=>'pugs', 'leo'=>'parrot', 'damian'=>"larry's evil henchman"); say %perl6leute<audrey leo>;

[22:47] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[pugsparrot‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:47] <thoughtpolice> <> is analogous to p5's qw() form; it creates a list where the token delimiter is whitespace

[22:47] <bloonix> ah

[22:48] <TimToady> but it works both standalone and as a hash subscript

[22:48] <thoughtpolice> yeah.

[22:48] <TimToady> and as an arg to adverbs

[22:48] <TimToady> ?eval say :foo<bar baz>

[22:48] <evalbot_r16861> Error: Named argument found where no matched parameter expected: ("foo",Syn "," [Val (VStr "bar"),Val (VStr "baz")])

[22:48] *** weinig_ joined
[22:48] <bloonix> but I dont understand the difference between %h{'foo'} and %h{foo}

[22:49] <TimToady> ?eval :foo<bar baz>.say

[22:49] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[foo	bar baz‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:49] <thoughtpolice> %h{foo} is treated as though foo is an actual subroutine; it's returning value is what's used as the key to find your element

[22:49] <TimToady> one has a string arg, and the other has something that cannot be a string

[22:49] <bloonix> okay

[22:49] <TimToady> there is not longer any special quoting rule about barewords inside {}

[22:49] <TimToady> yet another simplification

[22:52] <avar> oh goddamnit

[22:53] <avar> TimToady++

[22:53] <avar> lamers--

[22:53] <bloonix> what I said was that %h{foo} is equivalent to $h{&foo} and %h{'foo'} to $h{foo}

[22:53] <bloonix> p6 <-> p5

[22:53] <avar> and %h<foo> to %h{'foo'}

[22:53] <TimToady> well, equiv to foo(), since &foo means something weird in p5

[22:54] <TimToady> &foo in p6 is always just the sub object and doesn't call it

[22:54] <TimToady> you'd have to say &foo() to call it in p6

[22:58] <bloonix> what is the equivalent to ref() in p6 ?

[22:58] <TimToady> $x.WHAT

[22:59] <TimToady> (values are their own identity...)

[23:01] <bloonix> hmmm

[23:01] <TimToady> ?eval { 42 }.HOW

[23:01] <evalbot_r16861> \Class.new(("is" => ("Code",)), ("name" => "Block"))

[23:02] <TimToady> not all the metadata is hooked in yet in its final form

[23:03] <bloonix> $z is a hash ref if I do "my %x = (foo=>'bar'); my $y := %x;" ?

[23:04] <TimToady> well, no, but $y is.  :)

[23:04] <thoughtpolice> TimToady: you wouldn't happen to know if the circumfix category for defining your own operators is working fully, would you? in all the instances I've tried to use it, the multi-sub declaration has gone fine, however, actually attempting to use it has failed in every instance I've tried

[23:04] <bloonix> ?eval my %x = (foo=>'bar'); my $y := %x; say $y.WHAT

[23:04] <evalbot_r16861> OUTPUT[Hash‚ê§] Bool::True

[23:04] <bloonix> oops, of course TimToady :)

[23:04] <bloonix> to many x y z today :)

[23:04] <TimToady> probably not; it'll start working as soon as we can swap in STD.pm for the parser

[23:05] <bloonix> is there a equivalent to strict and warnings in p6 that I can use?

[23:05] <TimToady> it's the default for anything longer than a one-liner

[23:05] <dduncan> yay

[23:06] <TimToady> I think evalbot has strict turned off these days.

[23:06] <TimToady> ?eval $foo

[23:06] <evalbot_r16861> \undef

[23:06] <TimToady> that used to complain about undefined

[23:06] <TimToady> ?eval use strict; $foo

[23:06] <evalbot_r16861> Error: *** Unsafe function 'use' called under safe mode‚ê§    at -e line 16, column 7-63

[23:06] <TimToady> heh

[23:07] <dduncan> unfortunately, that presents problems ...

[23:07] <dduncan> when trying to reproduce an error in pugs, because evalbot behaves differently

[23:07] <TimToady> anyway, put a bare $foo into a file and run it, and you should get an error

[23:07] <thoughtpolice> TimToady: ah. at least fun can be had with infix/postfix/prefix. I assume the same can be said about postcircumfix?

[23:07] <TimToady> or just from the command-line interface

[23:07] <dduncan> how do you turn strict on for evalbot oneliners, so we can get consistent behaviour

[23:07] <TimToady> it appears to be strict by default

[23:08] <dduncan> with the command line

[23:08] <bloonix> TimToady: right. it occurs an error. fine

[23:09] <TimToady> ?eval module Foo; $foo

[23:09] <evalbot_r16861> \undef

[23:09] <TimToady> ?eval use v6; $foo

[23:09] <evalbot_r16861> \undef

[23:10] <TimToady> that *should* turn strict on, I think...

[23:11] <bloonix> $pair = :key('value'); <--- only one pair?

[23:11] <bloonix> $x = :foo('bar'), :baz('foobar'); dont works :)

[23:12] <TimToady> yes, that's a scalar assignment, so doesn't get past the comma

[23:12] <TimToady> ?eval @x = :foo('bar'), :baz('foobar');

[23:12] <evalbot_r16861> [("foo" => "bar"), ("baz" => "foobar")]

[23:12] <TimToady> works better with list assignment

[23:13] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - have you seen the dive into Perl 6 series of blogs?

[23:13] <TimToady> some

[23:13] <bloonix> how can I access bar?
