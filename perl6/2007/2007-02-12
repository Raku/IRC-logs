[16:45] <rindolf> So is audreyt really not feeling well?

[16:46] <TimToady> yes, and likely to be out for quite some time

[16:46] <TimToady> one doesn't just "bounce back" from hepatitis, normally

[16:47] <rindolf> TimToady: I see. :-(

[16:51] <BooK> which kind of hepatitis is it?

[17:01] <TimToady> BooK: didn't say

[17:02] <TimToady> 'course, the word itself just means an inflamed liver, which could have any number of causes

[17:02] <merlyn> including literally? :)

[17:03] <andara> yes, but unless it's type-A, it's very serious

[17:03] <merlyn> as in, if a person's liver is physically on fire, does it count as hep? :)

[17:03] <merlyn> and what if it's in a pan being cooked?

[17:03] <TimToady> merlyn: don't be inflamatory. :)

[17:04] <merlyn> yes, I don't mean to flame.

[17:04] <merlyn> too easy to get burned that way

[17:04] <TimToady> so we changed inflamable to flamable to avoid confusing people, why didn't we change inflame to flame at the same time?

[17:05] <merlyn> we need "outflame" :)

[17:05] <TimToady> audreyt needs her liver outflamed.

[17:05] <merlyn> exactly

[17:05] <merlyn> make some deflamatory remarks

[17:06] <TimToady> I don't want to get sued for deflamation.

[17:06] <[particle]> give me a break. can't we leave this topic alone?

[22:08] <__Ace__> I am wondering.. say I have this "bigger" project that needs to be implemented. Should this be done in C or C++?

[22:09] <__Ace__> (I am thinking that Perl which is rather big, is done in C)

[22:09] <__Ace__> but with C++ you may have some more libraries handy

[22:10] <__Ace__> or, do it in C, and still use the C++ lib...

[22:10] <nwc10> which language are you more comfortable with?

[22:10] <moritz> __Ace__: it all depends on what you're doing...

[22:10] <nwc10> and how portable does it need to be?

[22:10] <moritz> __Ace__: if it's fairly lowlevel, use C

[22:10] <moritz> __Ace__: if it's a GUI toolkit: use C++

[22:10] <jrockway> __Ace__: haskell :)

[22:11] <moritz> and for the rest: perl ;)

[22:11] <__Ace__> Im better with C

[22:11] <__Ace__> and if it has to do with databases..

[22:12] <jrockway> i can't help but think "#ifndef __Ace__" ;)

[22:12] <moritz> well, obvisly __Ace__ _is_ defined ;)

[22:13] <__Ace__> :)

[22:13] <moritz> __Ace__: just take a look if your db's c-bindings look cool or not...

[22:13] <__Ace__> hmm, looking to see if I can find some mysql API for C..

[22:13] <__Ace__> some lib that is..

[22:13] <moritz> __Ace__: if yes, then C surely is a good choice

[22:14] <Patterner> Use DBI :)

[22:14] <__Ace__> or

[22:14] <Patterner> C only if you need speed.

[22:14] <__Ace__> I embedd perl with C :)

[22:15] <__Ace__> damn, its redicoulusly easy to embedd perl in C

[22:15] <__Ace__> its little harder with embedding modules there though :)

[22:16] <__Ace__> else if would be easy to create a single executable :)

[22:17] <__Ace__> moritz: no good gui toolkit made in C?

[22:18] <moritz> __Ace__: there are (gtk), but gui toolkits are a thing that can be done _very_ neatly with object orientation
