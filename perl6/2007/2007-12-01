[03:28] <meppl> good night

[03:33] <ispy_> hey guys, how do I access an anonymous array within a hash in p6?

[03:33] <ispy_> sorta like @{ $struct{key} } in p5.

[03:34] <ispy_> I'm not convinced that "for %hash<something> -> my $element { }" actually works.

[03:36] <ispy_> when I do it, it seems to display all of the elements in scalar context.

[06:14] <TimToady> @tell ispy_ you can use "for %hash<something>[] -> $element { }" to get at all the elements; scalar values don't automatically flatten in a list even if they happen to be compositie objects

[06:14] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[17:23] <pina> So I've begun using perl

[17:23] <pina> For automating unit testing and collecting logs..

[17:23] <pina> How good is that for a start

[17:23] <pina> I like it because of CPAN ;)

[17:25] <pina> it is said that anything you might want to write can be done with CPAN and 40 lines of Perl code and that Perl is about a million times more concise than Java.

[17:27] <pina> Regular expressions are cool. But you need libraries also

[17:27] <pina> Don't you guys think we need that?

[17:31] <pmurias> pina: what do think we need?

[17:32] <pina> I would like to complete reading SICP one day

[17:32] <pina> Its a bit more easier to read than Knuth

[17:32] <pina> pmurias: I rthink perl is great, LISP is a lil low on libraries though

[17:37] <masak> pina: indeed, CPAN is an asset

[17:41] <pmurias> i would risk saying that SICP is a lot easier than the Art of Computer Programming

[17:47] <masak> yes, but that's because they're about different things

[17:48] <masak> both are great books, mind you

[17:49] <masak> but the greater complexity of TAoCP is due to its wider scope and ambitions

[17:49] <pmurias> the use of the MIX dosn't help

[17:51] <masak> :)

[17:52] <masak> From the Wikipedia article: "Some readers are put off by the use of assembly language, but Knuth considers this necessary because algorithms need a context to judge speed and memory usage."

[17:55] <pmurias> not being able to read code examples (withought looking up instructions constantly) is annoying

[17:56] <masak> so learn MIX

[17:56] <masak> it's not much more effort than to learn some other language

[17:56] *** amnesiac joined
[17:58] <pmurias> masak: do you have a working mix knowlege?

[17:59] <masak> pmurias: somewhere between being able to read it directly and being able to write it directly, yes

[18:00] <masak> then again, I keep coming back to TAoCP1 for more, and each time a learn a little more MIX

[18:03] <Patterner> MIX is obsolete. Use MMIX :)

[18:04] <masak> Patterner: good point, but it doesn't work if you're reading the book

[18:05] <masak> although these guys have been doing an admirable job so far: http://mmixmasters.wiki.sourceforge.net/

[21:32] <syle2> whats status on perl6? does it compile and does it support all the cpan modules?

[21:36] <Tene> syle2: there are a few implementations of varying completeness.

[21:36] <Tene> If you want to use Perl 6 right now, the most feature-complete implementation is Pugs.

[21:36] <Tene> Pugs can use many of the modules in cpan without problem.

[21:39] <Tene> Pugs development has mostly stopped for a while.  Parrot development has been very rapid lately, and they have a great infrastructure, but their Perl 6 implementation isn't very complete ATM.

[21:39] *** hanekomu joined
[21:41] <syle2> can i add a request?

[21:44] <syle2> currently function does: return($a,\@b,$c);You call it with: my($a,$b,$c)=test(); and have to use my @b = @$b; to get a copy of the array 

[21:44] <syle2> be nice if we could do return($a,@b,$c);  my($a,@b,$c)=test();

[21:44] <syle2> same with shift and @_

[21:46] <syle2> i think when a function exits all local variables, arrays, hashes, references should be destroyed, return on what you want out of it

[21:47] *** woremacx joined
[21:49] <syle2> I think of a function as you pass in something and should return something, end of story, I guess that would screw up reference passing but honestly if you can pass back out what you want there is no need for it, probably consume less memory cleaning up after every function execute as well without references and globals lying around everywhere

[22:35] <neuromu> as in Design Patterns, generics == parametric types
