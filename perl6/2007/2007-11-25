[18:22] <pheature> any idea when perl6 will be released?

[18:22] <yath> together with duke nukem forever and, maybe, gnu hurd

[18:25] <pheature> yath: are there such serious issues around perl6, or are you just joking?

[18:25] <yath> pheature: i'm just kidding. to be honest, i have no idea, sorry :)

[18:27] <pheature> yath: heh, ok

[18:29] <ebassi> pheature: around christmas. the exact year is unknown

[18:29] <ebassi> pheature: seriously, http://dev.perl.org/perl6/faq.html

[18:30] <pheature> :)

[18:30] *** drrho joined
[18:37] <pheature> do you people really think it's a good idea to change the regex language so radically?

[18:37] <pheature> it's not like i am against, it's just that i am afraid this (along with some other similarly radical changes) could prevent wide adoption

[18:38] <pheature> i am not a traditionalist myself

[18:50] *** drrho left
[18:56] <pheature> are there any warnings against starting to code for pugs?

[19:04] <pheature> anybody awake? :)
