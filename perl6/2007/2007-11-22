[16:08] <dlocaus> fglock: ping?

[16:08] <fglock> pong

[16:09] <dlocaus> fglock: I've noticed that some of the code isn't licenced.  I'm not a laywer, but I think the code should be licenced... I don't know GPL3 or Perl Artistic, but there are a lot of jerks out there.

[16:09] <dlocaus> It would be good to protect the community "effort", by putting a licence on the code.

[16:10] <fglock> sure

[16:10] <dlocaus> I would be happy to update the code, do you have a licence you want to use?

[16:10] <dlocaus> or is that a community decision?

[16:10] * dlocaus looks at the 129 people on the irc.

[16:11] <fglock> the Emitter::Perl5 license looks ok

[16:11] *** ruoso joined
[16:11] <fglock> just replicate it to the other files

[16:12] <dlocaus> ok

[16:12] <dlocaus> fglock: is this still right?

[16:12] <dlocaus> The Pugs Team E<lt>perl6-compiler@perl.orgE<gt>.

[16:13] <fglock> I think so

[16:14] <dlocaus> fglock: what gets licenced? everything?

[16:15] <fglock> yes, all the source code

[16:23] <dlocaus> fglock: http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/generic-licencing.txt?rev=18896

[16:23] <lambdabot> Title: /v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/generic-licencing.txt - Pugs - Trac, http://tinyurl.com/2s33r6

[16:23] <dlocaus> fglock: just to make sure.

[16:23] <dlocaus> fglock: this is what you want on all the pages?

[16:26] <fglock> dlocaus: look ok

[16:33] <pmurias> fglock: wouldn't it be better to add an mp6-runtime emitter to kp6 than to add an kp6-runtime emitter to mp6?

[16:33] *** rindolf joined
[16:39] <fglock> pmurias: the idea is to phase out the mp6 runtime, because it doesn't support "full" Perl 6

[16:41] <fglock> but I think we can go ahead without changing mp6

[16:41] <fglock> bootstrapping kp6 with kp6 seems doable, once the current problems are fixed

[16:43] <pmurias> ok

[16:50] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[16:50] <dlocaus> fglock: I've added licence(s) to all the code.

[16:50] <dlocaus> I skiped one of the lisp files, which apparently the author had GNU licenced it.

[16:50] <dlocaus> I also skipped the mp6 code as I'm not sure that we "can" licence that.

[16:50] <dlocaus> (not our code?)

[16:50] <dlocaus> fglock: can we licence the lisp code?  did we write it?

[16:51] <pmurias> avar and Aankhen wrote the lisp code

[16:51] <dlocaus> avar: Aankhen``: ping

[16:52] <fglock> I only started the Lisp emitter; most of the work is from Avar and Aankhen

[16:52] <dlocaus> @tell avar "I am currently updating all of the code to include a licence.  An example licence is at: http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/generic-licencing.txt", if this is acceptable to you please let me know."

[16:52] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[17:23] <dlocaus> fglock: I think the licencing killed the parser

[17:24] <dlocaus> I think due to the way the code parseses (a kind of incremental growth), an extra 1k has really slowed down the parsing

[17:25] <dlocaus> I think I've been compiling for about 1/2 hour now

[17:25] *** justatheory joined
[17:27] <dlocaus> oh wait a minute

[17:27] <dlocaus> might be just this file... 

[17:27] <dlocaus> can miniperl6 handle pod documentation?

[17:28] <dlocaus> pmurias: can mp6 handle pod documentation?

[17:31] <dlocaus> nope, I don't think so

[17:31] *** thoughtpolice joined
[17:32] <dlocaus> ah ha!

[17:33] <dlocaus> bug: if a pod is at the end of a file being compiled by mp6.pl it MUST have a \n to terminate the file.

[17:40] <Aankhen``> dlocaus: For my part, I'm okay with whatever licence is being used for other KP6 stuff.

[17:40] <lambdabot> Aankhen``: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[17:40] <araujo> hello here

[17:40] <dlocaus> Aankhen``: ok, thank you

[17:40] <Aankhen``> As for the POD, isn't that required?

[17:40] <araujo> who should i talk to to get my commit bits restored?

[17:40] <dlocaus> just waiting on avar now

[17:41] <Aankhen``> I mean, doesn't legal POD require a newline afterwards?

[17:41] <dlocaus> I don't know.

[17:42] <dlocaus> Aankhen``: yep

[17:43] <Aankhen``> Kewl.

[17:43] <dlocaus> Aankhen``: you are right, perl5.8.8 docs say that an blank line is required
