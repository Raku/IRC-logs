[03:47] *** justatheory left
[03:49] <TimToady> mostly is_type just wants to see if there's a package of that name in ::*, I suspect.

[03:50] <TimToady> (or in the current namespace)

[03:52] <rhr> how does one do that?

[03:57] <TimToady> it's just a SMOHP...

[03:58] <rhr> HP?

[03:58] <TimToady> Haskell Programming

[03:58] <TimToady> I suppose you could eval"$name" and see if it complains about barewords

[03:59] *** snearch joined
[03:59] <TimToady> though presumably that's just depending on whatever pugs's idea of is_type is...

[04:00] <rhr> wouldn't that find subs etc. also?

[04:00] <TimToady> well, you'd have to look at the return type, I suppose.

[04:01] <TimToady> but it'd certainly be better if pugs actually implemented symbol tables as user-accessible hashes...

[04:01] <TimToady> maybe there's a way to get at the info

[04:01] <TimToady> I just know GLOBAL::{$name} doesn't work yet

[04:02] <rhr> ah, I thought there was supposed to be some kind of hash...

[04:03] <rhr> should is_type handle things like Int|Str?

[04:03] <TimToady> probably not

[04:04] <TimToady> that's just a constraint, not a real type

[04:04] <TimToady> is_type is really for named types

[04:05] <rhr> what about e.g. unit23?  will all of those be pregenerated in GLOBAL::?

[04:05] <TimToady> unit23?

[04:05] <TimToady> oh, uint

[04:06] <rhr> yes, sorry

[04:06] <TimToady> um, some will likely be pregenerated, I suppose

[04:06] <TimToady> but probably not uint23

[04:06] <rhr> but it's supposed to take any integer there, right?

[04:07] <diakopter> heh

[04:07] <TimToady> we only guarantee powers of two

[04:07] <diakopter> (sorry)  just imagining really large integers

[04:07] <TimToady> and only insofar as "supported" by the architecture, for some def or other

[04:09] <rhr> ok.  I'll leave the current implementation in place for now, and add a commented-out GLOBAL:: impl awaiting haskell magic

[04:10] <TimToady> some of this may straighten itself out eventually when we get MO in pugs

[04:10] <TimToady> we've hardwired some unicode stuff too, which is fine for now

[04:11] <TimToady> but we do need to check for user-defined types there at some point

[04:12] <rhr> right, but that would have to go in the "action" part of STD, no?

[04:12] <rhr> which doesn't exist yet

[04:12] <TimToady> *nod*

[04:13] <TimToady> except insofar as we're currently assuming pugs is good enough, whether it is or ain't.  :)

[04:14] <rhr> :)

[04:15] <TimToady> next I need to write something that runs inside parens and rules that runs down the .prior links and builds a real match object, somehow

[04:15] <pugs_svnbot> r17409 | rhr++ | [STD] is_type should be a little different in the future

[04:15] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/17409

[04:15] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17409 - Pugs - Trac

[04:15] <TimToady> but pugs is not friendly toward people who want user-defined Match or Capture objects, sigh

[04:16] <TimToady> for now about all I can get is $<foo> and $<0> out of a Hash object

[04:17] <rhr> did you notice that at some point parsing 42+1 began failing with 'pugs: unexpected node: <Scalar:0x2b59c57e9348>'?  Not sure what the problem is or when it stopped working.

[04:18] <TimToady> I broke it when I switched to $/

[04:18] <TimToady> needs fixin

[04:18] <rhr> ok

[04:18] <TimToady> but it seemed obvious to me that $/ needed to be the real in-flight transactional object

[04:19] <TimToady> or we were going to be doing your copy-in-copy-out trick all over

[04:19] <rhr> yes, that makes sense.  afk a few mins &

[08:51] <laniz_> maybe silly to ask, but that code wont do its magic with Perl 5.8, right?

[08:52] <wolverian> hmm? it's perl5 code afaik

[08:53] <laniz_> then its a perfect example to learn from :D

[08:54] <wolverian> except it uses Net::IRC ..

[08:54] <laniz_> thats why its great to learn from for me. POE is too complex for a start

[08:55] <wolverian> well, sure, just be aware that Net::IRC is a buggy piece fo crap :)

[08:56] <wolverian> quite. 

[08:56] <wolverian> 11:56       purl : net::irc is at http://www.funkplanet.com/irc/ or always good for a laugh or a scare, depending on if you're reading the comments or the code (= or see also  POE::Component::IRC or not supported any more and dennis tells people to use PCI. or an abomination and a crime against nature.

[08:56] <wolverian> purl knows best :)

[08:57] <wolverian> but, yes, POE needs some headwrapping around to make sense.

[11:40] <pmurias> it emitts 'literal' ok, but splits literal into 7 seperate chars

[11:50] <fglock> for recompiling, there is util/build-perl5.sh

[11:51] <fglock> then recompile again, in order to check that it bootstraps

[11:55] <Shillo> Oh. Hiya!

[11:55] <Shillo> Glad to see -somebody- awake. :)

[11:56] <pmurias> agentzh: there are some syntax issues blocking it

[11:57] <pmurias> kp6 runs only t/01-sanity/01-tap.t unmodified

[11:57] <rindolf> Hi Shillo 

[11:57] <rindolf> Shillo: it's 15:00 here.

[11:58] <pmurias> but i for one would love to use the pugs test suit

[12:01] <fglock> agentzh: re test suite, yes,

[12:01] <agentzh> pmurias, fglock: thanks for the answers :)

[12:01] <fglock> but kp6 still needs some more infrastructure before it can do that

[12:02] <agentzh> okay

[12:02] <agentzh> fglock: is kp6 mature enough to replace PCR?

[12:02] * agentzh is looking for ways to let himself hack on kp6 and related stuff in $work...

[12:02] <fglock> hmm - it could

[12:03] <fglock> kp6-perl5rx is more powerful than PCR

[12:03] <agentzh> great

[12:03] <fglock> but it's not an easy task...

[12:03] <agentzh> hehe, gathered so ;)

[12:04] <fglock> i'm using v6.pm at work

[12:04] * agentzh wants a lua/c++ backend for mp6/kp6.

[12:05] <agentzh> performance is very important here...v6.pm is just not good enough to let my $boss happy ;)

[12:05] <fglock> agentzh: nferraz wants a lua backend too - are you going to the hackathon?

[12:05] <Shillo> rindolf: It's 2pm here, and I'm at work. :)

[12:05] <agentzh> fglock: i'm afraid not...but i'd love to help ;)

[12:06] <Shillo> So, few people on IRC, as Europe works while US still sleeps.

[12:06] <fglock> if you need performance, the shortest path would be to port perl5rx back to PCR

[12:06] <fglock> instead of waiting for kp6 to get faster

[12:06] *** thoughtpolice left
[12:07] <agentzh> fglock: okay, will take a closer look at perl5rx :)

[12:07] <fglock> let me find an example

[12:08] <agentzh> k

[12:08] <pmurias> agentzh: are you worried about regex speed or general speed

[12:08] <agentzh> pmurias: the latter

[12:10] <fglock> agentzh: this is an example of kp6-perl5rx - it should print a Match dump of the result

[12:10] <Shillo> Heh, parrot backend would actually be a good start.

[12:10] <fglock> perl kp6-perl5.pl --perl5rx <  examples/token-test-recurse.pl | perl -Ilib5regex -Ilib5

[12:10] <agentzh> fglock: thanks :)

[12:10] <agentzh> Shillo: parrot backend == moving target

[12:10] <agentzh> Shillo: == pain :)

[12:11] <fglock> agentzh: you can pipe the compiled code through perltidy, to see the generated perl5 regexes

[12:18] <agentzh> fglock: how are you debugging p6 regexes while hacking? is there any tracing tool?

[12:18] <fglock> agentzh: no, it just works :P

[12:18] <agentzh> wow...*impressed*

[12:18] <agentzh> it always just works?

[12:19] <pmurias> no

[12:19] <fglock> just kidding :)

[12:19] <fglock> i add print statements

[12:20] <agentzh> okay

[12:20] <agentzh> i'm going to develop a graphical regex tracer for the current PCR.

[12:20] <pmurias> i had to look at the emited code once because mp6 emitted $$<foo> eq 'a' wrongly

[12:20] <agentzh> the basic facilities are already there...

[12:21] <agentzh> pmurias: right, mp6 cannot be bug free (at least for now) :)

[12:21] <pmurias> the compile speed for me with mp6 is slow enough that it's better to think more then to add print statements

[12:22] <agentzh> pmurias: *nod* that's a very good reason for a real regex tracer/debugger

[12:22] <fglock> pmurias: there was a reason to have it frozen...

[12:23] <agentzh> fglock: i know that reason :)

[12:26] <pmurias> if kp6 obsoletes it will be very nice

[12:26] <pmurias> obsoletes mp6

[12:47] <rindolf> agentzh: do you want to write Perl6 code for production?

[15:33] <moritz_> laniz_: you're welcome ;)

[15:34] <moritz_> ilbot2.pl isn't up to date and may have db timeout issues on low traffic channels

[15:34] <laniz_> covers 3 topics at once that i want to learn :)

[15:34] <moritz_> which ones?

[15:35] <laniz_> irc connectivity, mysql access and templates 

[15:37] *** Aankh|Clone joined
[15:38] <laniz_> surprising to me was, that DBI tutorials have no real good example that explains how you access certain data that is stored in mysql. and i usually learn by playing with examples

[15:38] <laniz_> and projects like blootbot or buubot are too complex to learn from

[15:38] <laniz_> (if you start as beginner)

[15:39] *** buetow left
[15:39] <moritz_> actually the CGI code is getting a bit complex as well

[15:39] <moritz_> if you download earlier revisions, the CGI code is easier

[15:48] <moritz_> laniz_: did you do a 'svn co' first?

[15:48] <laniz_> yeah, but maybe too long ago, hang on

[15:49] <laniz_> Skipped '.'

[15:50] <moritz__> is this the pugs root directory?

[15:50] <laniz_> yep

[15:50] <fglock> pmurias: ping

[15:51] <fglock> pmurias: Can't locate KindaPerl6/Grammar/Statements.pm in @INC

[15:51] <moritz__> laniz_: I'd recommend r16066 as a starting point

[15:51] *** weinig_ joined
[15:52] <laniz_> oh

[15:52] <moritz__> r1 is _really_ old, and doesn't contain ilbot at all

[15:53] <laniz_> the svn syntax somehow does not work for me, but its not that important

[15:54] <moritz__> what does a simple 'svn up' produce?

[15:54] <laniz_> Skipped '.'

[15:54] <laniz_> but does not fetch a thing

[15:54] <moritz__> which means that something is wrong with your working copy

[15:54] <laniz_> or is "up" to upload to the repo and i need "down" or something?

[15:54] <moritz__> or you aren't in a svn repo at all

[15:55] *** Aankhen`` left
[15:55] <moritz__> no, "up" is to "update" your local copy

[15:55] <moritz__> upload is "commit" or "ci"

[15:55] *** irclogbot left
[15:55] *** moritz_ left
[15:55] <laniz_> well. but if i checkout r17416 before that it cant update a thing, no?

[15:56] <moritz__> the normal output would be "At revision 17416."

[15:57] <[particle]> svn co http://svn.pugscode.org/trunk -r 16066  # is that correct?

[15:57] <moritz__> s/trunk/pugs/

[15:58] <[particle]> laniz_: i suggest you create an empty directory for pugs, change to it, and run that (corrected) command

[15:58] <SamB> svn up is short for svn update. as in, you can run the latter and it does the exact same thing.

[15:58] <laniz_> svn co http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/irclog/ --> Checked out revision 17416. | then: svn up -r 16066 --> Skipped '.'

[15:58] <moritz__> laniz_: first you have to go into that directory

[15:58] <moritz__> cd irclog; svn up

[15:59] <moritz__> cd irclog; svn up -r 16066

[15:59] <laniz_> oh crap, you said that before. i am sorry

[15:59] <moritz__> no problem

[16:03] <moritz__> and since it'll be back in 1H I don't bother with configuring it

[16:04] <laniz_> oh wait, all this will be recorded... oh no

[17:40] <deraadt> It was in my freshman year I lost my virginity. I was always the dork in high

[17:40] <deraadt> #

[17:40] <deraadt> school, spending more time writing perl than going out to parties and doing

[17:40] <deraadt> #

[17:40] <deraadt> drugs. Freshman year taught me otherwise though, and my teacher was Geneva

[17:40] <deraadt> #

[17:40] <deraadt> Wall, known simply as "the sex demon," but most importantly the daughter of my

[17:40] <deraadt> #

[17:40] <deraadt> idol, Larry Wall.

[17:40] <ruoso> shit... can soneone kick this shit...

[17:40] <deraadt> I was sitting in my intro to Psychology class (we're all required to take some

[17:40] <deraadt> arts courses, unfortunately) when she strode in. She was a bit short and dumpy,

[17:40] <deraadt> and looked sorta' emo. I immediately recognized her, however, because of the

[17:40] <deraadt> amount of time I spent browsing the Wall family home page. I knew immediately

[17:40] <deraadt> that I wanted to get to know her, perhaps so I could just say I knew Larry's

[17:40] <deraadt> daughter. I edged towards her in the lecture hall, hoping to not seem too

[17:40] <[particle]> diakopter: ping

[17:40] <deraadt> creepy. I sat down three seats away from her.

[17:41] <deraadt> As the prof droned on about something, I felt a tap at my shoulder. I turned to

[17:41] <deraadt> see who it was, and sure enough it was my future sex partner.

[17:41] <deraadt> "Hi, I see you're reading my father's book!" I looked down and saw my copy of

[17:41] <deraadt> the Perl 5 book sitting in my lap. I turned bright red and quickly moved to 

[17:41] <deraadt> cover it up. "Don't worry, I think it's cool. Let's chat after class." She

[17:41] <deraadt> turned back to reading whatever it was she had open on her lap. I think it was

[17:41] <deraadt> a bible (after all, the Wall family was very religious).

[17:41] <deraadt> After class I waited at the exit to the lecture hall for her to come out. As

[17:41] <deraadt> she left the lecture hall, bible under one arm, backpack slung lazily over one

[17:41] <deraadt> shoulder I offered a warm handshake to her and finally uttered my first words

[17:41] <deraadt> to the stumpy Geneva Wall.

[17:41] <deraadt> "Hi, my name is Theo, it is an honor to meet you." She giggled and accepted

[17:41] <deraadt> my handshake.

[17:41] <deraadt> "Nice to meet you Theo, do you have any classes next?"

[17:41] <deraadt> "Nope, I was just going to do some oclets and head back to my dorm room." She

[17:41] <deraadt> seemed to tilt her head quizzically at the term oclet, but quickly shook it off.

[17:41] <deraadt> "Well, why don't you come back to my dorm room and we can get to know eachother?"

[17:42] <moritz_> diakopter: could you please kick the spammer?

[17:42] <deraadt> she said, with a slightly coy wink. Excited to be hanging out with the daughter

[17:42] <ruoso> obra, ping?

[17:42] <deraadt> of the legendary Larry Wall, I quickly accepted and followed her back to the

[17:42] <deraadt> residences.

[17:42] <deraadt> After a few minutes of walking in a somewhat awkward silence, we arrived at her

[17:42] <deraadt> dorm room. "Come on in!" she urged as she unlocked the door and opened it. I

[17:42] <deraadt> walked into the dorm room and had to blink a few times before my eyes could

[17:42] <deraadt> adjust to the light. She closed the door quickly behind her and set her books

[20:22] <holst> ok, but standalone in the sense of .pyc in perl and .class in java?

[20:22] <moritz_> holst: but perhaps you can avoid that by not using eval

[20:23] <holst> hmm, thats something. 

[20:23] <moritz_> but the term "standard perl6 suite" is rather vague

[20:23] <holst> its just ashame that the best thing we got in the year 2007 which compiles native code is ... C 

[20:23] *** kane_ left
[20:23] <moritz_> because everything that passes the test suite is "official" and therefore "standard" ;)

[20:24] <moritz_> allow me to disagree.. we've got eiffel

[20:24] <moritz_> nobody uses that, but for OO programming that's really great

[20:24] <holst> hmm, i've heard about it but I think the syntax was too weird for me (never used it)

[20:29] <moritz_> the syntax is quite oposite to perl: rather verbose, virtually no "special" chars

[20:29] <moritz_> and very readable

[20:30] <moritz_> you don't have to know the language to understand an eiffel program... kinda like pascal with "real" OO

[20:30] <holst> I was looking at a lot of programming languages a bit back, I might have it confused with some other languge

[20:31] <thoughtpolice> we have haskell! :)

[20:31] <holst> maybe that was the one I was thinking off =D

[20:32] * thoughtpolice is working on the new version of his irc bot

[20:32] <thoughtpolice> the first code base was alright

[20:32] <thoughtpolice> then I realized it was too cumbersome to really work with so I did the natural thing

[20:32] <holst> I was looking for a languge 'which is not C++ but efficient and can talk to C'

[20:33] <thoughtpolice> rewrite it, which is what I'm doing. :)

[20:33] <holst> and also I wanted it to be efficient to /program in/ not only in execution

[20:33] <thoughtpolice> and damn, I need something to blog about for DIP6. once school starts I don't know how much I'll be able to do that. :(

[20:34] <moritz_> holst: well, perl 5 and 6 are not C, and can/will be able to talk to C ;-)

[20:34] <moritz_> holst: and so can Eiffel

[20:34] <thoughtpolice> haskell can as well. :)

[20:34] <moritz_> Aye

[20:34] <moritz_> sadly you need a major brain twist for that

[20:34] <thoughtpolice> the 6.8 of ghc is looking nice. should be out sometime in the next month, give or take a few.

[20:35] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: well there's the standard ffi, there's also greencard but I'm not sure how much easier it makes talking to C.

[20:35] <moritz_> thoughtpolice: re DIP6, are you looking for a topic?

[20:35] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: somewhat.

[20:36] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: if you have any ideas you can have post priviledges on it. i've been thinking about it for a while and more people posting stuff on it would make it much more useful than just I posting could.

[20:36] <thoughtpolice> like I said, my last year of high school is starting in ~4 days or so, and when that happens, I'm not sure how much I'll be able to blog (or even code.)

[20:36] <thoughtpolice> so having someone else in the ring would be really nice. :)

[20:36] <moritz_> thoughtpolice: I won't have too much time either, but I can give it a shot

[20:36] <holst> not being able to code and being a student? thats an oxymoron

[20:37] <holst> you will be coding like there is no tomorrow as soon as the exams are closing in =D

[20:37] <thoughtpolice> holst: hah.

[20:37] <moritz_> possible ideas: rules (2), self defined operators...

[20:38] <holst> thoughtpolice: anything to avoid studying, you know =D

[20:38] <moritz_> modules and classes

[20:38] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: anything would be appreciated. :) if you want priviledges to post just gimmie an email.

[20:38] <moritz_> thoughtpolice: you can uses these ideas as well ;)

[20:39] <thoughtpolice> perl 6 is a community effort, so I figure a part of those people blogging would be beneficial.

[20:39] <holst> moritz_: will perl6 core interpreter still be written in haskell when it hits -std or will it be rewritten in C?

[20:39] <Tene> It will be written in Perl 6.

[20:40] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: sent. :)

[20:40] <holst> isnt that a moment 22?

[20:40] <thoughtpolice> moritz_: if you have any ideas of anybody else who would like to contribute, just ask and I'd be glad to give priviledges. ;>

[20:41] <moritz_> thoughtpolice: ok

[20:43] <moritz_> holst: what do you mean?

[20:43] <holst> to implement perl6 in perl6. it would need a perl6 parser, which is itself!

[20:44] *** ubajas joined
[20:44] <holst> I can see how to compile a C compiler with a compiler written in C is do-able, since it's compiled and not interpreted

[20:44] <thoughtpolice> naturally to be able to do this we already need a sufficient perl 6 implementation, which is what pugs aims to be once it's milestones are finished. :)

[20:45] <moritz_> holst: if perl 6 is compiled to parrot bytecode, it's the same situation as with C

[20:46] <moritz_> after all even perl 5 is mostly a compiler

[20:46] <holst> maybe I was really talking about the parrot

[20:46] <Tene> holst: perl6 is first being written in Haskell and Parrot and such with the goal of making a good enough perl 6 to write perl 6 in perl 6.

[20:46] <moritz_> holst: parrot is written in C

[20:47] * holst withdraws from *

[20:47] <holst> Im clearly opening my mouth about things I should not =D

[20:48] <holst> anyways, I was just curious about the current state of perl6 and what this bytecode optimizer etc. backend meant to me as a 'native code' lover

[20:49] <holst> if I was in my own house I would say that we have too much of this 'byte code' this day

[20:49] <holst> but I guess there is trends in everything

[20:49] <thoughtpolice> byte code isn't necessarily a bad thing. it helps bootstrap to other platforms. if you have some, say, ANSI C interpreter for bytecode, you've already got your implementation a lot of places.

[20:49] <Tene> Perhaps we need a cpu that runs parrot natively. ;)

[20:50] <moritz_> Tene: that's a good idea...

[20:50] <holst> like those 'java cpus'

[20:50] <moritz_> Tene: perhaps we can translate the parrot source code to System C to create one ;-)

[20:50] <holst> (no they dont exist, /end of concept proof)

[20:50] <thoughtpolice> i was thinking recently about a haskell compiler for embedded platforms; byte code would be an optimal choice in that instance.

[20:51] <holst> but why not compile into native code with library substitutes for things the native cpu cant handle?

[20:51] <moritz_> what about a parrot backend for GHC?

[20:51] <thoughtpolice> which is something I've thought of since I got my psp. :) haskell on the iphone would definately score a few points as well (although bindings for objective-c would be needed.)

[20:52] <moritz_> holst: I'm not a low level guru, but probably things like JIT-compiling and GC are not easily done in libraries

[20:52] <moritz_> holst: and you lose portability

[20:52] <holst> the portability is in the compiler

[20:52] <holst> like gcc

[20:52] <holst> anyways, I dont want to drive too far off topic with that =D

[20:52] <moritz_> which means "recompiling for every platform"

[20:53] <moritz_> topics are totally overrated ;-)

[20:53] <holst> (compiling is not a bad thing)

[20:53] <holst> just look at gentoo =D

[20:53] <thoughtpolice> for something like embedded platforms, you're dealing with a lot of potential architectures and binary formats, etc.

[20:54] <thoughtpolice> if you have some haskell compiler like I was saying, it'd probably just be a lot easier to have some sort of ANSI-C runtime. if you have that, you've already got your implementation a *lot* of places, by only doing the work once.

[20:54] <moritz_> holst: I'd say that looking at gentoo proves that compiling _is_ a bad thing indeed ;-)

[20:54] <moritz_> just my 0.02€

[20:55] <moritz_> my first japh: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=634962

[20:55] <holst> hehe, you are preaching to the already believing 

[20:56] <holst> gentoo is insane

[20:56] <holst> however, it would be equally insane to use a java backend for all programs in all x86 computers

[20:56] <moritz_> why isn't lambdabot posting the title of my URL?

[20:56] <moritz_> @seen lambdabot 

[20:56] <SamB> possibly more insane

[20:57] <SamB> lambdabot is seriously ill, apparantly

[20:57] <SamB> I saw a lambdabot2 in #haskell

[20:57] <holst> moritz_: will that format my harddrive or something? =D

[20:57] <SamB> ... hey ... isn't lambdabot2 in the same process as lambdabot?

[20:58] <moritz_> holst: I don't know what it will do on your maschine, but it left mine healthy ;-)

[21:40] *** Limbic_Region joined
[21:44] *** Aankh|Clone left
[21:46] <rhr> is the above correct, and should other things like "Commit branch" and "didn't match at" be changed likewise?  Or is there something wrong with $¢?

[21:47] *** Elly left
[22:01] <TimToady> $¢ should have worked there--it's set first thing in that routine.

[22:01] <TimToady> and it should be to, not from, at least for forward ops

[22:02] *** dmq left
[22:02] *** ubajas joined
[22:03] <rhr> until something matches most of $/ (includint $/.to) is undef

[22:03] *** blindfish joined
[22:03] *** iblechbot left
[22:04] <TimToady> $/ should start defined; note that first call is passed MCont.new() now, not 0

[22:04] <TimToady> however, .new could init .to to 0, I suppose

[22:05] <TimToady> s/init/default/

[22:05] <rhr> I guess it should just use +$¢ there instead of $¢

[22:05] <TimToady> but in general .from is the beginning of the *previous* match

[22:05] <rhr> oh, ok.

[22:05] <TimToady> so would be correct only when prev match was ""

[22:07] <rhr> so I guess I'll change all debugging use of $¢ to +$¢, does that sound right?

[22:08] <TimToady> $¢ should always be a StrPos now, so the + should be unnecessary, assuming ~ produces the same answer

[22:08] <TimToady> for now, if it's not really an Int, it's a bug

[22:09] <rhr> well, it's just undef, which stringifies to ""

[22:09] *** thepler left
[22:10] <TimToady> then it needs = 0 or // 0 somewhere

[22:10] <rhr> how about my $¢ = +$/.to;?

[22:11] <TimToady> again, the + should be unnecessary, and merely covers a bug elsewhere

[22:12] *** ubajas3 left
[22:13] <rhr> I don't see what you mean.

[22:13] <TimToady> string positions are not integers, in the long run, they're opaque

[22:14] <TimToady> $/.to should always return a StrPos, and a StrPos should always work anywhere a string position is necessary, without knowing whether it's measured in bytes, chars, or whatever

[22:15] <rhr> so an undef StrPos should stringify to "0"?

[22:15] <TimToady> It's only that pugs assumes all string positions are measured in codepoints that we use ints for now

[22:16] <TimToady> 0 is a convenient but misleading notation for "beginning of the string"

[22:16] <TimToady> it's the only number that doesn't care what its units are

[22:17] <rhr> I'm confused.  The problem is that $¢ starts out undef, so you get messages like "_BRACKET called at\n".  I don't see how changing the type of $¢ would fix that...

[22:17] <TimToady> $¢ should not start out undef, it should start out initialized to the beginning of the string

[22:18] <rhr> OK, so the problem is that $/ starts out with ("to" => undef)

[22:18] <TimToady> yes

[22:19] <rhr> can that only be fixed in pugs?

[22:19] <rhr> and does using +$¢ in the debug messages make sense in the meantime?

[22:21] <TimToady> no, and no

[22:21] <pugs_svnbot> r17430 | lwall++ | set proper default on .from and .to
