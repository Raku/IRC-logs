[14:09] <masak> yes

[14:10] <bloonix> this is what I ever looking for

[14:10] <agentzh> makstos++

[14:14] *** marmic joined
[14:15] <moritz_> is there a particular reason that there are no comparision infix ops in kp6?

[14:15] <moritz_> I mean there is == and !=, but no < or >

[14:17] <agentzh> moritz_: just hack them in! ;)

[14:17] *** chris2 joined
[14:17] <agentzh> moritz_: just as fglock like to say, kp6 is mostly demand-driven...

[14:18] <agentzh> moritz_: personally i'd rather it be test-driven, like pugs...

[14:18] <moritz_> agentzh: I know how to hack them into the grammar, but the implementation is the problem

[14:18] <agentzh> hehe

[14:18] <bloonix> how can I use variables between p5 and p6 ?

[14:18] <bloonix> example:

[14:18] * agentzh is still reading kp6's source...

[14:18] <pasteling> "bloonix" at 87.79.195.119 pasted "my $uid; { use v5; $uid = getp" (9 lines, 110B) at http://sial.org/pbot/27080

[14:19] <agentzh> bloonix: man, you're crazy ;)

[14:19] <bloonix> :)

[14:19] <moritz_> bloonix: I think it _should_ work this way

[14:20] <moritz_> man, compiling Grammar.pm is slow

[14:20] <bloonix> agentzh: sorry but getpwuid isnt implemented yet and I need a way :)

[14:20] * agentzh is not a kp6 hacker yet.

[14:20] <moritz_> but not as slow as pugs ;)

[14:21] <bloonix> I got it

[14:22] <bloonix> my $uid = do { use v5; getpwuid(1) }

[14:22] * agentzh has to run out of the $office and catch a bus &

[14:22] <bloonix> works very well :)

[14:22] <masak> bloonix: wow

[14:22] <moritz_> cool

[14:23] <masak> bloonix++ # brave p6 user

[14:23] <bloonix> masak: unfortunately its p5 code in the do block :)

[14:24] *** agentzh left
[14:24] <bloonix> but I think its a fine workaround until its implemented

[14:31] <moritz_> no

[14:41] <bloonix> Im confused!

[14:41] <bloonix> "unhandled support type: DESTROY at (eval 1) line 129."

[14:42] <bloonix> does anyone know why this message happends?

[14:43] <masak> in which situation?

[14:44] <bloonix> I dont know. line 129 is a comment

[14:44] *** obvio171 left
[14:44] <masak> it says "(eval 1) line 129", so it's probably not line 129 of your file

[14:45] <bloonix> yes, but I dont know where to search the line

[14:45] <masak> I understand. that's why I asked "in which situation?"

[14:45] <masak> because there must be some other part that broke

[14:45] <masak> what is it that you are running when it happens?

[15:08] <bloonix> if I comment out the part "my $usr = do { }" the message doesnt comes

[15:09] <bloonix> if I execute only the do block nothing happends

[15:11] <bloonix> if I think in p5 DESTROY will be executed if a object is destroyed

[15:11] <bloonix> maybe this way to search

[15:17] <bloonix> but:

[15:17] <bloonix>  my $usr = (~$0).getpwuid2;

[15:17] <bloonix> sub getpwuid2 { use v5; return getpwuid("@_");

[15:17] <bloonix> }

[19:39] <moritz_> is the last element of an array @array[-1] or @array[*-1]?

[19:41] <Gothmog_> The latter, iirc.

[19:41] <moritz_> I think so as well, but I can't remeber why

[19:42] <Eidolos> it's the latter according to the Synopses

[19:42] <Eidolos> but I'm pretty sure Pugs still uses [-1]

[19:42] <moritz_> I thought * in array subscripts was 'whatever', so I'd read @foo[*-1] as "everything up to the last item"

[19:43] <Eidolos> whatever is very contextual :) in subscripts it means the last item + 1

[19:43] <Eidolos> the reason for the change from Perl 5 is (at least partly) because of subtle bugs with unexpected negative subscripts

[19:43] <moritz_> good point
