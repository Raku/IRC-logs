[00:07] <svnbot6> r15172 | lwall++ | First snapshot of proposed standard Perl 6 grammar in standard Perl 6.

[00:08] <TimToady> (it is by no means complete)

[00:09] <TimToady> mostly a translation of pmichaud++'s current grammar into something more like its final form.

[00:11] <TimToady> still missing a lot of terms, and a lot of {*} commentary

[00:12] <TimToady> just checked it in so you could see the direction I'm headed with it...

[03:45] <meppl> i always read "TimToday"

[04:10] <SamB> dyslexic a bit?

[04:16] <allbery_b> no, just the usual tendency to map something to what's familiar

[04:16] <allbery_b> I went through that too, I use "today" rather more often than "toady"

[04:16] <allbery_b> so the latter always looks like a typo

[04:23] <tene> It took me a while to figure out what meppl had typed differently.

[04:24] <tene> I kept reading it as "Toady"

[07:27] <TimToady> good to see him pulling his weight a little more.  :)

[07:29] <jrockway> so is YAPC::Asia going to have a TimToady presence this year?

[07:30] <TimToady> nope, have to be on the east coast that week.

[07:30] <TimToady> alas

[07:30] <TimToady> wouldn't mind going to YAPC::Asia every year...

[19:09] <putter> Doesn't look like kp6 has one.  Drat.  (v6/v6-KindaPerl6/lib/KindaPerl6/Grammar.pm)

[19:11] <putter> There is a misc/pX/fglock/Precedence.pm, but it looks like an unfinished draft.

[19:16] <putter> tewk started a transliteration of PGE (written in parrot) to P5.  misc/pX/tewk/Rules-P5/

[19:49] <Limbic_Region> rodi - give me a few

[19:51] <rodi> Limbic_Region: thanks, I appreciate it.

[19:51] <Limbic_Region> rodi - you are listed as "pending"

[19:52] <Limbic_Region> do you want me to send a new one or tell you the address the last one went to?

[19:53] <rodi> Limbic_Region: I'm sure it went to my yahoo address, but I'm afraid I probably deleted it :-\  mind sending another?

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> oh, and btw rodi - it is a @yahoo.com  address which ate mine

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> I ended up having audreyt resend to my gmail account

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> sure

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> will do

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> if you don't get this one we can try another

[19:54] <rodi> coolio, I'll check shortly.

[20:03] *** justatheory joined
[20:04] <Limbic_Region> in any case, I just did an "add" with the exact same details as were "pending"

[20:08] <PartclCoke> So i'm looking into implementing tcl's [trace] on parrot. requires hooks for pre-HLL subs, post, and then pre and post on each *line* of the sub. I'm looking for the perl6 equivalents. S06 makes a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to PRE/POST/ENTER/LEAVE/KEEP/UNDO. Are these explained in any more detail anywhere?

[20:09] *** BooK_ is now known as BooK

[20:13] <PartclCoke> (and, is there any interest tcl's apparently slightly more fine grained settings)

[20:15] <PartclCoke> ... finally, should I be asking this on the mailing list. =-)

[20:16] <PartclCoke> (I see the test for this section in pugs is TODO...)

[20:20] <lumi> Closure traits?

[20:20] <lumi> S04 maybe?

[20:21] <PartclCoke> ah. a cross reference from s06 would have been most helpful there, danke. =-)

[20:23] *** justatheory joined
[20:24] <PartclCoke> so it looks like tcl's [trace add execution (enter|leave) ...] are like perl6's ENTER and LEAVE; I have no desire to implement any of the other stuff that perl6 needs, and it looks like tcl has a few more related features that perl6 doesn't. Hurm.

[20:24] <PartclCoke> though it looks like many of those traits can be implemented *in terms of* ENTER & LEAVE, so I don't feel too guilty.

[20:25] <PartclCoke> any sample code for those?

[20:25] *** justatheory joined
[20:25] <lumi> Other than the tests?

[20:26] <PartclCoke> Didn't see any tests in pugs.

[20:26] <PartclCoke> saw, "TODO"

[20:26] <lumi> t/closure_traits/* ?

[20:26] <PartclCoke> (in http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t)

[20:26] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 15175: /t

[20:27] <PartclCoke> ah. hadn't looked for enough different kinds of traits. thanks again.

[20:27] <lumi> np

[20:27] <PartclCoke> ... I am continually reminded of how ugly I think this is. :|

[20:28] <lumi> How is it ugly?

[20:28] *** weinig is now known as weinig|bbl

[20:29] <lumi> Looking at the smoke, it looks like everything in closure_traits passes

[20:29] <PartclCoke> perl6? Most of the samples I see leave me thinking "powerful, but ugly". If I had anything more articulate, I'd be on the language list with it. =-)

[20:30] <lumi> There's always Lisp

[20:30] <PartclCoke> eh. perl5 is fine. =-)

[20:30] <PartclCoke> Hurm. no way to add ENTER/LEAVE at run time?

[20:30] <lumi> You find Perl 6 uglier than 5?

[20:31] <PartclCoke> typically, yes.

[20:31] <PartclCoke> perhaps I'll have a change of heart if I ever actually use it. who knows.

[20:32] <lumi> Just wait til Christmas

[22:13] <moritz> hi, I just wantet to hint that the "Binary builds" link on pugscode.org is a 403 ;)

[22:14] <moritz> and the "illustrations" link as well 

[22:14] <putter> there's only a single exception flavor, and I don't really need a payload.  so simple is fine.

[22:14] <putter> E::C is slower than Error?

[23:34] <wolverian> tene, ruby2 uses -> (a, b) { ... } to denote a lambda, apparently.

[23:35] <putter> lol

[23:35] <allbery_b> oh, that

[23:35] <wolverian> what does the comment that older rubies didn't have a real lambda mean? are they broken like in python?

[23:36] <wolverian> and they're read only

[23:36] * wolverian stares at evalbot_r15175 

[23:37] <putter> ruby 1.* lambdas...   a = 2;  lambda (a) {...}  the a arg is bound to the same cell as the a = 2.

[23:37] <wolverian> oh. it doesn't grab its own context? that's no lambda.

[23:38] <putter> lambda(b) would work as expected.  as long as b isnt mentioned in surrounding context. :/

[23:38] <wolverian> well, ruby's scoping is broken in any case.

[23:51] <moritz> no, it's not in testing

[23:51] <moritz> so I'll just have to get the unstable version...

[23:52] <putter> curious that we haven't hit it before.

[23:53] <putter> tene: I'm too out of date to have anything interesting to say.  You might look at a recent smoke to get an idea of current status.

[23:53] <moritz> it's not even listed at http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/

[23:53] <lambdabot> Title: Debian -- Software Packages in "unstable", devel section

[23:54] <putter> I didn't have to install it separately.  Could it be (supposed to be?) part of the normal ghc package?

[23:55] <moritz> putter: then it wouldn't be listed separately als pool/main/h/haskell-network

[23:55] *** weinig is now known as weinig|away

[23:55] <moritz> putter: (at least I think so )

[23:56] <moritz> I'm currently playing with my pinning to get a haskell package from unstable

[23:57] *** buetow joined
[23:58] <putter> tene: if you explore, and it turns out pugs is using a p5-side implementation of p6 regexs, I would be interested in hearing that.
