[08:12] <Zoffix> moritz_, lookbehind is zero-length, you need to capture what it matches instead

[08:12] <moritz_> right

[08:12] <moritz_> as soon as you gave me the right regex it became obvious ;)

[08:13] <moritz_> $VAR1 = ['aaa','a','bb','b','c','c'];

[08:14] <moritz_> is that because split() returns the captured text as well?
