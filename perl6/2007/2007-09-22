[18:40] *** Limbic_Region joined
[18:40] <xinming> hoelzro: Don't know. But as my ghc is 6.6.1

[18:40] <TimToady> you can probably just install http://haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.6.1/ghc-6.6.1-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2

[18:40] <hoelzro> MU9214: -j is the flag

[18:41] <MU9214> but pretty fast, b/c it has no gui. just text (ubuntu server edition)

[18:41] <xinming> MU9214: I'd suggest you not try to compile ghc really.

[18:41] <TimToady> how much memory?

[18:41] <xinming> how much ram?

[18:42] <MU9214> 195mb

[18:42] <xinming> I'd suggest with at least 512. otherwise, the compiling process will make your system unusable...

[18:42] <MU9214> yeah its old

[18:42] <hoelzro> yeah, binary distribution would be ideal.

[18:42] <MU9214> binary distribution?

[18:42] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/2bxe87

[18:42] <MU9214> xinming: no

[18:43] <TimToady> but compiling pugs will also chew up a lot of memory

[18:43] <xinming> MU9214: I think debian has 6.6.1 version of ghc. not sure, as I do compile it myself.

[18:43] <TimToady> even if you have binary ghc already

[18:43] <MU9214> so pretty much i should live with perl 5, and just play with pugs on the site?

[18:43] <xinming> IIRC, compiling for GHC, the mem usage is more terrible than pugs.

[18:43] <MU9214> is that what you guys are saying?

[18:43] <Limbic_Region> MU9214 - you might be able to get a binary distribution of both pugs and GHC

[18:44] *** devogon joined
[18:44] <xinming> MU9214: For now, I think so. But you can try other distribution.

[18:44] <Limbic_Region> depends on how current you want to be and what platform you have

[18:44] <MU9214> hoelzro: just playing with it. nothing special.

[18:44] <hoelzro> MU9214: there's a pre-compiled version of 6.6.1

[18:44] <MU9214> hoelzro: ?

[18:44] <hoelzro> MU9214: good enough for me =D

[18:44] <hoelzro> MU9214: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.6.1/ghc-6.6.1-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2

[18:44] <MU9214> hoelzro: that will work without needing ghc6.6.1 ?

[18:44] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/3auyf3

[18:44] <xinming> MU9214: BTW, you can try that first really.

[18:44] <MU9214> oh wait..

[18:44] <MU9214> \lol

[18:45] <xinming> MU9214: But also prepared for some time to wait for the compiling process on your machine.

[18:45] <MU9214> will the machine still be unusable like you were saying? 

[18:45] <MU9214> (although as long as still apache works, i'm fine)

[18:46] <TimToady> it'll be unusable while you're compiling Parser.hs  :)

[18:46] <xinming> MU9214: on my 2500+ (1G ram) machine, It might take an hour to compile pugs.

[18:46] <MU9214> xinming: does it slow the machine down a lot after it's compiled? or is it just the comiling I'm worried about?

[18:46] <xinming> MU9214: the problem is that your ram is too small, and then, Linux system will doing swap heavily.

[18:46] <MU9214> compiling*

[18:47] <TimToady> it's quite likely to thrash while compiling some of the larger .hs files

[18:47] <xinming> MU9214: when It's compiling, It will slow down, after It's finished. It's all ok.

[18:48] <xinming> MU9214: BTW, I think you can consider It's a stress test for your desktop. ;-)

[18:48] <MU9214> maybe I'll just stick with perl 5, and play with pugs online..    but when pugs is done, and not in development, will it be easier to install (and not take as  long?)  

[18:48] <hoelzro> MU9214: probably

[18:48] <hoelzro> but pugs development has slowed down a lot

[18:48] <MU9214> k...

[18:48] <TimToady> kb6 and parrot are moving faster at the moment

[18:48] <TimToady> kp6 rather

[18:49] <TimToady> my keypoarp is pyslexic

[18:49] <xinming> TimToady: BTW, what distribtution you use? :-)

[18:49] <TimToady> fedora

[18:50] <MU9214> hmm..  apt-get install pugs pugs-doc    seems to be working... I'll see.....

[18:50] <MU9214> (found that online)

[18:50] <TimToady> might be pretty ancient

[18:51] <MU9214> 6.2.13

[18:51] <TimToady> what revision?

[18:51] <MU9214> doesnt say

[18:51] <MU9214> how do i find out?

[18:51] <xinming> MU9214: You have to install it first

[18:51] <xinming> and then, run pugs, It will show the revision.

[18:52] <MU9214> it installed (in apt-get)

[18:52] <xinming> MU9214: try pugs

[18:52] <xinming> pugs

[18:52] <MU9214>   Version: 6.2.13

[18:52] <MU9214>                       Copyright 2005-2006, The Pugs Contributors

[18:52] <TimToady> I'm not sure bare 6.2.13 shows the revision number.  If not, it's almost a year old.

[18:52] <xinming> Oh... then, I think yes, It's pretty old.

[18:53] <xinming> MU9214: TimToady is right. Just look at the (C). ;-)

[18:53] <TimToady> we were about to roll a new version when audreyt got very sick

[18:53] <MU9214> can I upgrade it (without going through all the compile stuff? now that its installed trough apt-get)

[18:53] <xinming> TimToady: what happened to audreyt? *_*

[18:53] <xinming> MU9214: No, You can't, You have to compile it yourself

[18:53] <MU9214> I DONT WANT TO!! lolo

[18:54] <TimToady> she got hepatitis

[18:54] <xinming> MU9214: Then. prey and wait for *perl 6* ;-)

[18:54] <MU9214> can't someone update the apt-get one?

[18:54] <MU9214> so i can use that?

[18:54] <hoelzro> it requires ghc-6.6.1 =P

[18:55] <MU9214> .......

[18:55] <MU9214> this sucks.

[18:55] <MU9214> lol

[18:55] <hoelzro> well

[18:55] <TimToady> you could get an account on feather and run it there

[18:55] <hoelzro> you could submit a ghc-6.6.1 package to the ubuntu team

[18:55] <MU9214> hoelzro: dont know how

[18:56] *** toshinori left
[18:56] <MU9214> just download it, and submit it to them?

[18:56] <hoelzro> now'd be a good time to learn =D

[18:56] <hoelzro> learn how to make a .deb

[18:56] <hoelzro> compile ghc-6.6.1 and make a .deb from it

[18:56] <hoelzro> and go through the proper channels with the Ubuntu team to submit it

[18:56] <MU9214> i dont want to compile it though. you guys said the comliling takes an hour.

[18:57] *** rindolf joined
[18:57] <hoelzro> you can compile while you sleep =D

[18:57] <xinming> MU9214: But you don't need to sit at the computer while it's compiling.

[18:57] <MU9214> but how about the ram (you said it would be bad)

[18:57] <hoelzro> it'll just take longer

[18:57] <hoelzro> or, if you can access a more powerful machine

[18:59] <MU9214> grr how do you exit pugs?

[18:59] <hoelzro> :q

[19:01] <TimToady> or ^D

[19:01] *** toshinori joined

[19:15] <hoelzro> yup

[19:15] <MU9214> how long will PUGS take to compile? Another hour?

[19:15] <hoelzro> not sure, but make sure you do "make soon"

[19:15] <hoelzro> that'll help

[19:19] <hoelzro> MU9214: I just compiled pugs from scratch;  took me 2.5 minutes

[19:19] <hoelzro> but that's my machine

[19:20] <MU9214> ...   ok, I'm gonna compile the ghc from scratch i guess too, but i hope it doesn't ruin my machine  or anything (or cause a reboot.. I'm trying to brag about my 17 day uptime lol)

[19:22] <MU9214> after I untar it what do I do,   ./configure   ?

[19:22] <TimToady> I think you're just about to the point of bragging about a 17 day compile time...

[19:22] <MU9214> for ghc

[19:22] <hoelzro> MU9214: just read the README

[19:22] <MU9214> TimToady: *sigh* your making me not want to do it again.

[19:23] <MU9214> whats the difference between the pugs I got through apt-get and the new one?

[19:23] <TimToady> I used to dream that our old black-and-white TV magically turned into a color TV.  But that never happened in real life...

[19:23] <hoelzro> the new pugs will be up-to-date

[19:23] <MU9214> hoelzro: but it will function the same, right?

[19:24] <hoelzro> MU9214: better

[19:24] <hoelzro> MU9214: we hope =D

[19:24] <MU9214> just to play around, it will be fine (what i have)

[19:24] <MU9214> right`/

[19:24] <MU9214> ?

[19:24] <hoelzro> probably

[19:24] <MU9214> k...

[19:24] <Limbic_Region> I used to dream that the C64 my sister abandoned might work until I got so frustrated I stabbed it repeatedly with a flat head screw driver

[19:25] <MU9214> for pugs, what do i use   #!/usr/bin/pugs  instead of /usr/bin/perl  ?

[19:25] <hoelzro> sure

[19:26] <MU9214> why does pugs take so long to print something?

[19:26] <hoelzro> pugs is kinda slow =(

[19:26] <hoelzro> about 100x slower than perl 5

[19:26] <hoelzro> optimization and speed aren't our priority right now

[19:27] <MU9214> will that be fixed in the off. release?

[19:27] <hoelzro> I should think so

[19:28] <MU9214> pugs took 4 seconds to print 2 lines..   

[19:28] <MU9214> sounds like I'm not missing out on much

[19:28] <hoelzro> we're trying to flesh out the feature set before we make it fast

[19:29] <hoelzro> plus, I don't know much about optimization...*yet*

[19:33] <TimToady> most of that is startup time having to do with reading in the Prelude

[19:33] <TimToady> (currently stored as yaml)

[19:33] <TimToady> when we get the Prelude compiled straight to Haskell pugs will start much faster

[19:35] <TimToady> of course, it starts much faster on a much faster machine as well... :)

[20:24] <Aankhen``> <avar> Aankhen``: Where does this global say stuff come from?! # er, what?  Are you talking about the calls to DEFINE-KP6-FUNCTION in GLOBAL.lisp?

[20:24] <avar> Aankhen``: So, the kp6-find-function and kp6-find-package stuff needs to be reworked to fit that workflow

[20:24] <Aankhen``> That workflow is messed up in its translation to Lisp…

[20:24] <avar> i.e. "I'm looking up the global package" and then "I'm looking up the say member in that package" and then "dispatch to that"

[20:24] <Aankhen``> That's fine.

[20:24] <avar> not really, just lookup, lookup and funcall

[20:24] <Aankhen``> The specifics are a problem.

[20:25] <Aankhen``> '(kp6-lookup 'kp6-Hash_KP6 (make-instance 'kp6-Str :value "GLOBAL")

[20:25] <Aankhen``> That makes no sense.

[20:25] <Aankhen``> You're trying to run KP6-LOOKUP on that value, which is a quoted call to KP6-LOOKUP with a first argument that's *almost* a class name.

[20:26] <Aankhen``> I'm not sure how to fix it, is all.

[20:26] <avar> I guess that can be chanded

[20:38] <Aankhen``> Wait, is a Lookup only a namespace lookup or a generic hash lookup?

[20:39] <avar> It's a namespace lookup

[20:39] <Aankhen``> Okay.

[20:39] <avar> at least the node is only made in Namespace.pm

[20:41] <Aankhen``> Where does $.obj in the emit_lisp method for Lookup come from?

[20:41] <Aankhen``> Rather, I know that it's a class attribute, but what object is it?

[20:42] <avar> I don't know

[20:45] <avar> $.obj comes from the ::Lookup call, see above

[20:45] <Aankhen``> Hmm.

[20:45] <Aankhen``> Ah, ::Var.

[20:46] <avar> So to emit 'kp6-Hash_KP6 (quote in front) we'd have to check if $.obj is a Var or Lookup

[20:47] <avar> I was trying to figure out how to do that yesterday which resulted in TimToady going off on a tangent:)

[20:48] <Aankhen``> We don't want 'kp6-Hash_KP6 to be emitted, do we?

[20:49] <avar> We want something which is the global root hash to be emitted

[20:49] <avar> whatever that is

[20:59] <avar>         my $op := $.code.emit_lisp;

[20:59] <avar> your class Apply should look like this

[20:59] <avar> I commited the evil hack so hello world would work

[21:00] <Aankhen``> Ah, yes.

[21:00] * Aankhen`` hax.

[21:02] <Aankhen``> Okay, my output just got messed up.  Hrm.

[21:04] *** MU9214 joined
[21:05] <Aankhen``> It does a double lookup for some reason.

[21:05] <Aankhen``> And with the wrong stuff.

[21:05] <avar> you mean in GLOBAL and Code_Say?

[21:05] <Aankhen``> (kp6-find-package (kp6-find-package kp6-Hash_KP6 (make-instance 'kp6-Str :value "GLOBAL")

[21:05] <avar> followed by (make-instance 'kp6-Str "Code_say") ....

[21:06] <Aankhen``> Yeah.

[21:06] <avar> it's looking up the GLOBAL hash and then the Code_say object in that

[21:06] <Aankhen``> Ohh, right.

[21:06] <Aankhen``> Let's see, hrm.

[21:07] <avar> $kp6_hash_KP6->{GLOBAL}->{Code_say}->("hello world")

[21:07] <Aankhen``> How would I tell whether $.obj is looking up a function or a package?

[21:07] <Aankhen``> No, that doesn't make sense.  Let me think about it a bit.

[21:08] <avar> It's either looking up a variable (kp6-Hash_KP6) or a hash element

[21:08] <avar> which can be GLOBAL or Code_say in this case

[21:08] <avar> And I can change the variable part to be a function call or whatever by changing Namespace.pm

[21:09] <Aankhen``> Wait, KP6 is handling the namespace-as-hash thing?

[21:09] <avar> Yes, that's what the Namespace.pm visitor does

[21:10] <avar> It basically explodes Foo::Bar::Zar into $global->{FOO}{BAR}{ZAR}

[21:10] <Aankhen``> Ahh.

[21:11] <avar> This is basically implementing Perl 6 globs, whatever those are called now

[21:12] <Aankhen``> The ::Lookup isn't being passed a proper ::Index object for some reason.

[21:13] <avar> index => ::Val::Buf( buf => ($node.namespace).join('::'), ),

[21:13] <Aankhen``> Goddangit, gimme a proper ::Index.

[21:14] <Aankhen``> :-P

[21:16] *** rindolf left
[21:18] <avar> I need an obj and index argument for that, currently it's only being passed a string

[21:18] <avar> what do you actually need?

[21:19] <Aankhen``> "Code_say" instead of (make-instance 'kp6-Str :value "Code_say"), and same for "GLOBAL".

[21:20] <avar> Why not just (kp6-value) on it in a generic function that does perl->cl ?

[21:21] *** Blwood joined
[21:21] <Aankhen``> I guess.  Just seems stupid to say (kp6-value (make-instance ... :value "foo")) to get "foo".

[21:22] <avar> I guess

[21:22] <avar> But I think it's better for now to make these wasteful objects everywhere in the name of simplicity

[21:23] <avar> A lot of this can be optimized later

[21:23] <avar> But we can do it if you want, just have to implement a new visitor instead of Val::Buf

[21:24] <Aankhen``> S'okay, simplicity is good.

[21:25] *** BinGOs left
[21:25] <Aankhen``> I followed my train of thought about ::Index and realized it ended at a non-existent station.

[21:26] <avar> package Lookup;

[21:26] <avar> sub new { shift; bless { @_ }, "Lookup" }

[21:26] <avar> sub emit_lisp { my $self = shift; my $List__ = \@_; do { [] }; ('(kp6-find-package ' . ($self->{obj}->emit_lisp() 

[21:26] <avar> that's how the $.whatever are implemented FYI:)

[21:28] *** BinGOs joined
[21:30] <Aankhen``> Right, time for sleep.  I'll catch you tomorrow.

[21:31] *** Aankhen`` left
[21:31] <avar> oh noes

[21:43] <MU9214> eval: print "test"

[21:43] <buubot> MU9214:  test1

[21:43] <MU9214> test1  ?

[21:43] <MU9214> ok, buubot sucks.. lol

[22:06] *** IllvilJa joined
[22:24] <dduncan> ?eval my $x = 3; say $x.WHERE;

[22:24] <dduncan> eval: my $x = 3; say $x.WHERE;

[22:24] <buubot> dduncan:  ''ERROR: 32646: Can't call method "say" without a package or object reference at (eval 213) line 1.

[22:25] <dduncan> anyway, it seems that .WHERE isn't implemented by Pugs yet

[22:25] <dduncan> what's the best currently working Pugs analogy for Perl 5's refaddr()?

[22:25] *** iblechbot left
[22:25] <dduncan> or alternately I should ask the real problem ...

[22:26] <dduncan> I have a parent object which has child objects, each having refs to the other

[22:27] <dduncan> I would like the parent's ref to children to be weak, so if external holdings of the child go away, so does the child, and then the object would be auto-removed from the parent's list of children

[22:27] <dduncan> I was currently trying to have a Perl-5 like Hash of key=obj-address, val=obj, and then the child's DESTROY would delete that item

[22:27] <dduncan> for itself

[22:29] <dduncan> generally speaking, what is the elegant Perl 6 solution for a weak-referenced collection of objects that auto-removes dead wood?

[22:29] <dduncan> for reference, see the checked-in ext/Muldis-DB/lib/Muldis/DB/Engine/Example.pm ... and the ::DBMS and ::Var classes

[22:30] <dduncan> I've already coded something Perl-5 like that should illustrate the behaviour I want
