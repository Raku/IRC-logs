[03:50] <glion> Hi everyone! 

[03:50] <glion> say i wanted to use only one perl6 feature, the new sigil rules

[03:51] <glion> are there ast transform tools to do that now?

[03:52] <glion> i.e. perl5 w/perl6 sigils -> ast -> perl5 ast -> for executing as regular perl5

[12:42] <fglock> I'm investigating BEGIN

[12:45] <fglock> in kp6 we have two scenarios

[12:46] <fglock> either detect side effects immediately when BEGIN finishes running,

[12:47] <fglock> or "dump" the whole environment when the compiler emits code

[12:56] *** ebassi joined
[13:00] <fglock> I'm looking for BEGIN examples in the synopsis, 

[13:00] <fglock> I don't see examples where BEGIN side effects need to be recorded

[13:01] <fglock> BEGIN { COMPILING::<$?FOO> = 42 }    # this can be special cased

[14:15] <[particle]> yes, i see that :)

[14:15] *** jhorwitz joined
[14:15] <fglock> it's possible to rewrite kp6 to use plain tables instead of Env, but i'm not sure we should go that route

[14:17] <pmurias> fglock: Env is?

[14:17] <fglock> pmurias: the closure structure that Pad points to

[14:18] <fglock> which makes possible to run BEGIN blocks

[14:19] <pmurias> fglock: thanks

[14:24] <pmurias> fglock: "plain tables" you mean not using the perl5 lexicals, but emulating them ourself?

[14:25] <fglock> no, just keep a table of lexicals, without creating a compile-time representation

[14:25] <fglock> which means, you forbid BEGIN

[14:26] <fglock> hmm - i don't like that

[14:26] <fglock> let's see it the other way out:

[14:26] <fglock> does it make sense to rewrite kp6 using perl6?

[14:27] <[particle]> then you need to wait for perl6 to have BEGIN

[14:27] <pmurias> [particle]: you should use onion as the project name ')

[14:27] <pmurias> s/')/;)

[14:28] <pmurias> i always get confused by perl6 vs Perl 6

[14:28] <[particle]> for perl6? yeah, i like that

[14:29] <pmurias> [particle]: you like onion?

[14:29] <pmurias> as a name
