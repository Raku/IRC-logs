[12:12] <masak> I don't know how to refer to specific lines in the synopses, but it's under "Modifiers"

[12:12] <masak> the :c modifier

[12:16] <moritz_> I know it should exist in some form, yes

[12:18] <masak> now I see -- I should have checked the tests first

[12:18] <masak> they are marked as TODO

[12:18] <masak> I wonder if that's one of those things that don't conflict with audreyt++'s MO branch

[12:19] <masak> so that it'd be safe to implement .pos

[12:19] <moritz_> masak: you should try ;)

[12:19] <masak> actually, I'd like to

[12:19] <moritz_> masak: there's no use waiting if we don't know how long

[12:19] <masak> true

[12:22] <masak> I'll probably have time to take a look at it this week

[12:22] <masak> and also, some of the failing tests

[13:04] <moritz_> so it's a grammar bug?

[13:04] <pmurias> moritz_: yes

[13:04] <masak> pmurias: what's the fix?

[13:05] <masak> have term_meth call term_meth instead of term?

[13:05] <pmurias> i think so (trying it out now)

[13:06] <pmurias> but you have also to avoid infinit recursion 

[13:08] <masak> yes...

[13:08] <pmurias> masak: do you want to try to fix it? :)

[13:08] <masak> I'm at $work right now, so not very convenient

[13:08] <pmurias> ok

[13:09] <masak> I'll have some time tomorrow or later this week, but I was going to try to get Str.pos into Pugs

[13:13] <masak> is there a graphing tool out there that generates a nice directed acyclic graph out of a set of dependencies?

[13:14] <moritz_> dot

[13:14] <moritz_> neato

[13:15] <moritz_> masak: it generated my keyring deps: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/images/tn_keyring.png

[13:19] <szbalint> I ran out of 2 gigs of memory :)

[13:19] <moritz_> well, it's 14840x18299 pixels

[13:19] <szbalint> it's a big image

[13:19] <masak> yes

[13:19] <moritz_> and firfox doesn't do any antialiased rendering

[13:19] <moritz_> that's why I also provide a map viewer: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/mapit/showmap

[13:20] <moritz_> of course that's utterly useless, but nice to have anyway ;)

[13:22] <masak> how feature-complete is v6?

[13:22] <masak> it seems to be pretty solid on grammars

[14:37] <[particle]> fglock: are you going to layer p6 on top of kp6, or is it just going to grow into p6?

[14:38] <fglock> [particle]: there are some problems i'd like to discuss; both are possible

[14:38] <[particle]> i know it's not mp6, but what features are "enough"

[14:38] <[particle]> k

[14:39] <fglock> kp6 already has enough for running 6-in-6, but not enough for runnin STD (which is the roadmap)

[14:39] <fglock> running

[14:39] <[particle]> hrmm

[14:40] <fglock> so we now have 2 roadmaps

[14:40] <fglock> one is for running STD, the other for bootstrapping kp6

[14:40] <[particle]> yeah, it's better to run STD at a lower level, for performance

[14:40] <moritz_> fglock: the roadmap has many gaps... for example, when will concurrency be added?

[14:40] *** JarJarBinks joined
[14:40] <avar> meesa want concurrency too

[14:40] <moritz_> fglock: or are these features considered optional?

[14:41] <avar> moritz_: concurrency of what?

[14:41] <moritz_> avar: threads, events, STM

[14:41] <fglock> moritz_: concurrency is not needed for STD or for bootstrapping, so it is optional for now

[14:42] <fglock> we can develop concurrency in... parallel

[14:42] <moritz_> ;)

[14:43] <moritz_> so the plan is basically "first get STD.pm working, then do the Rest"? ;-)

[14:43] *** [particle1 joined
[14:43] *** xinming left
[14:43] * [particle1 has begun playing with intel threading building blocks for parrot

[14:43] <fglock> it's more like - let's not forget STD

[14:43] <avar> concurrency is also largely the problem of the runtime which kp6 offloads to something else

[14:43] *** amnesiac joined
[14:44] <moritz_> avar: right... let's ask the parrot folks ;)

[14:44] <fglock> kp6 already has junctions, and it is up to the runtime to decide on dispatching (though Junction is implemented in Perl 6)

[14:45] <avar> Yeah, basically implemented as an array now right?

[14:45] <moritz_> avar: right

[14:45] <moritz_> not basically, exactly 

[14:46] <avar> yeah, any is just a loop with an early exit if it finds something:)

[14:46] <moritz_> right

[14:46] <moritz_> so is none

[14:46] <fglock> yes, the array stores the junction data, but the actual implementation is up to the low-level runtime

[14:46] <avar> it would probably be faster as a hash but that's a bit too early an optimization probably:)

[14:47] <moritz_> avar: that doesn't help for regex matching etc.

[14:47] *** xinming joined
[14:47] <fglock> [particle]: jonathan was considering working on a parrot backend for kp6

[14:48] <[particle1> is a junction a set or a bag?

[14:48] <avar> bag

[14:48] <[particle1> so hash won't work well

[14:48] <avar> some operations would be faster, not sure if it's a net win

[14:49] <[particle1> avar: right, that's for later, though (for me, anyway)

[14:49] <[particle1> fglock: yes, i'd like to talk to him about that, when he has tuits again

[14:50] <fglock> [particle1: re 6-in-6 problems, there are a few things that are hard to do in Perl 6

[14:50] <fglock> like pads

[14:51] <[particle1> that's hard in any language :)

[14:52] <[particle1> does kp6 'return' implementation use exceptions?

[14:52] <fglock> there is a workaround for now, but it would be nice if Perl 6 had support for high-level pads

[14:52] *** JarJarBi1ks left
[14:53] <fglock> [particle1: no (or, not yet)

[14:53] <avar> like my $symbols = $CALLER::; or something like that?

[14:53] <[particle1> ok, nqp needs 'return' and i was hoping kp6 had something helpful

[14:54] <[particle1> hey, [particle], would you cease to exist, so i can become you once more?

[14:54] <[particle1> time out, you bugger.

[14:54] <fglock> [particle1: it would be possible to desugar kp6 to nqp

[14:54] <[particle1> hrmm

[14:55] <fglock> avar: we need to be able to execute code inside a given pad; kpe currently uses an eval() trick

[14:55] <fglock> kp6

[14:56] <[particle1> so, pad contains blocks?

[14:57] <fglock> yes, pads are objects that contain closures

[14:57] <[particle1> okay. they're not in the grammar, but that seems okay. right now, nqp/perl6 do closure has-a pad

[14:58] <[particle1> kp6 is pad contains-a closure

[14:58] <[particle1> *has-a

[14:58] <fglock> it's more like Pad instances contain native closures

[14:59] <fglock> Block instances are a separate thing

[14:59] *** [particle] left
[15:03] <fglock> this is specific to the perl5 backend

[15:05] <fglock> but 6-in-6 will need something like that too

[15:06] <[particle1> so, are you currently working toward STD?

[15:06] <[particle1> or towards 6on6

[15:06] <moritz_> 6on6 implies STD, doesn't it?

[15:07] <[particle1> depends where the bootstrap is

[15:08] <pmurias> moritz_: 6-in-6?

[15:24] *** zamolxes left
[15:24] *** pmurias left
[15:25] <fglock> re 6-*-6 implies STD: yes, but there will be pre-christmas versions

[15:26] <[particle]> 5.99-on-5.98

[15:26] <[particle]> or better 5.999-on-5.99

[15:26] <moritz_> lol

[15:27] <moritz_> and then finally a christmas-on-pre_christmas ;)

[15:29] *** zamolxes joined
[15:31] * xinming prefers the 6.0(-)0.1 :-D

[15:32] <xinming> 5.99 is still perl 5. But 6.0 means we enter perl 6 world now.

[15:32] *** zamolxes left
[15:33] *** REPLeffect joined
[15:33] <moritz_> debian uses ~ for negative version numbers, so 6.0~5 < 6.0

[15:33] <[particle]> so perhaps it's 6-.01i-on-6-.1i

[15:33] <[particle]> when the imaginary component disappears, we have real perl 6

[15:33] <moritz_> nice pun ;-)

[15:34] <TimToady> masak: it's not entirely clear that strings should know their .pos anymore.  It's more like positions know their string.  Otherwise a string can't be shared between threads

[15:35] <TimToady> and the positions used in S05 will be stored in the current match state, not in the current matched string

[15:35] <masak> TimToady: that makes me very happy

[15:35] <TimToady> you might still refer to it as .pos, but only because $_ is likely to track the match state

[15:35] <TimToady> (within rules)

[15:35] <moritz_> so $_ is a "match state" in regexes, not the current string?

[15:36] <TimToady> correct.

[15:36] <moritz_> ok ;)

[15:36] <masak> TimToady: S05 is not up-to-date in that case

[15:36] *** zamolxes joined
[15:36] <moritz_> ETOOSLOW

[15:36] <TimToady> used to be $/, but that's going away

[15:36] <TimToady> no, it's not; I have pending changes

[15:36] <TimToady> $/ isn't going away entirely

[15:36] <moritz_> erm

[15:36] <TimToady> it's still the user's link to the last match

[15:36] <TimToady> but that's all it is

[15:36] <moritz_> will it go away, or just replaced by a different symbol?

[15:37] <TimToady> within a rule $/ changes to $_ for the current match state, probably

[15:37] <TimToady> (that's part of why "andthen" got defined the way it was)

[15:38] <TimToady> there are several other changes to S05 that Damian, Patrick, and I have been thrashing on recently

[15:38] <TimToady> mostly simplifications of various sorts

[15:38] <TimToady> most $<foo> just change to $foo

[15:38] <TimToady> (within the rule)

[15:38] <TimToady> for instance

[15:39] <TimToady> and current <+ws> probably settles on <.ws>

[15:39] <moritz_> for non-capturing groups only?

[15:40] <moritz_> what about char classes?

[15:40] <TimToady> <ws> captures, <.ws> doesn't

[15:40] <TimToady> as it was, either <[...]> or <+[...]>

[15:40] <moritz_> ok

[15:40] <TimToady> and you can use either <+alpha> or <.alpha> to suppress capture

[15:41] *** masak left
[15:41] <TimToady> anyway, that's the direction it seems to be heading at the moment

[15:41] <TimToady> main incompatible change is that <?foo> no longer eats positions

[15:42] <TimToady> (and that's a change we already made)

[15:42] <TimToady> also, there will be some kind of syntax for declaring my variables directly within the rule without having to fake them up in the signature

[15:43] *** ruoso left
[15:47] <TimToady> also, setting the value of a reduction closure is likely to change from "return" to "reduce" because what the rule really returns is the next match state with the reduction value attached
