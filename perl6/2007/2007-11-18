[09:29] <pmurias> ggoebel: the thing which comes to my mind is to make gather throw an exception if there is no Coro when it is used, and skip the test if it gather throws one on the first use

[09:29] <pmurias> s/if it/if/

[09:30] <pmurias> algthough that would need simple exception handling in kp6

[18:38] <ggoebel> pmurias: ok. That may require more TUITS than I've got. ...figuring out how to modify gather. But I'll try to look into it. I imagine if I get it to throw an exception the first time gather is called we'll be no worse off. The error will be more informative, and if I can't add simple exception handling perhaps someone else will ;)

[19:02] <pmurias> ggoebel: the problematic part about exception handling is adding CATCH'es to the right block

[19:02] <pmurias> exception throwing should be difficult ;)
