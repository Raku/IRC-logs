[09:16] * Aankhen`` waves at fglock and pmurias.

[09:17] <fglock> it's on "open-source corporate R&D"

[09:17] <Aankhen``> fglock: What is the best way to recognize in the AST that a sub has no explicit parameters, i.e. just the implicit @_?

[09:17] <moritz_> which lisp interpreter do I need for kp6-lisp?

[09:17] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Ideally, any should work. SBCL is recommended.

[09:17] <Aankhen``> moritz_: I believe avar uses CLISP.

[09:17] <fglock> Aankhen``: looking

[09:18] <pmurias> Aankhen``: when you wave at the abyss, the abyss waves back

[09:18] <Aankhen``> pmurias: I take it back! I take it back!

[09:18] <pmurias> moritz_: i use sbcl

[09:19] <moritz_> Aankhen``, pmurias: thanks, I'm installing sbcl now

[09:19] <Aankhen``> Kewl.

[09:20] <fglock> Aankhen``: check the contents of Sub.block.sig

[09:20] <Aankhen``> fglock: If it's empty, I should add a slurpy @_?

[09:21] <fglock> yes, you need to check that @positional and %named are empty

[09:21] <Aankhen``> I did consider that yesterday, but what about when the sub has an explicitly empty sig?

[09:22] * Aankhen`` checks the ASTs for comparison.

[09:22] <fglock> I didn't think about that

[09:23] <Aankhen``> Sigs appear identical in both cases.

[20:27] <pugs_svnbot> r18310 | Aankhen++ | 	* replaced KP6-MAKE-ARGUMENT-LIST with SIGNATURE->ARGUMENTS, which creates a new KP6-SIGNATURE object with blank fields, to avoid accidentally overwriting the sub signature.

[20:27] <pugs_svnbot> r18310 | Aankhen++ | 	* factored some functionality from WITH-KP6-ARGUMENTS into COLLECT-ARGUMENTS and BIND-ARGUMENTS.

[20:28] <pugs_svnbot> r18310 | Aankhen++ | 	* use KP6-PARAMETER objects instead of conses wherever arguments or parameters are used.

[20:28] <pugs_svnbot> r18310 | Aankhen++ | * replaced WITH-UNIQUE-NAMES in util.lisp with WITH-UNIQUE-NAMES from CL-UTILITIES.
