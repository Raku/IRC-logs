[07:25] <dduncan> what is David Koenig known by here?

[07:25] <dduncan> I have a question about Pyrl6

[07:26] <dduncan> specifically, there is an issue with the misc/Pyrl6 directory as it currently is, where it can't unpack in a case-insensitive files system, as it contains folders named Pyrl and pyrl

[07:27] <dduncan> this affects default installs of Mac OS X, and afaik Windows too

[07:27] <dduncan> can one of those be renamed without trouble?

[07:28] <dduncan> I asked for the id as there seems to be no such person in AUTHORS as I saw

[07:29] <dduncan> karhu

[07:29] <dduncan> it looks like from the Pugs log

[07:30] <dduncan> seen karhu

[07:31] <dduncan> oh, you'll do it ... okay then ... email cancelled

[07:32] <dduncan> technically, I could have fixed it too, but thought I'd ask the author

[09:25] <dduncan> you mean that 5.10 will do that, or do you refer to something else?

[09:25] <demq> we also do \R which is NOT from the perl6 spec. but hopefully thats ok as it IS part of PCRE 7 and IS part of the unicode report:tr18.

[09:25] <rgs> it does.

[09:25] <demq> 5.10 will do it

[09:25] <moritz> ok, then, release it ;-)

[09:25] <rgs> it does since right now. :)

[09:26] <rgs> moritz: easy to say !

[09:26] <rgs> I wish I could !

[09:26] <moritz> rgs: I know, I'm just kidding ;)

[09:26] <dduncan> On a tangent, any idea when 5.10 may come out?  I'm hoping it would be early enough for Mac OS X 10.5 to bundle it.

[09:26] <dduncan> rather than bundling 5.8.x

[09:26] <rgs> "asap"

[09:27] <demq> do you know how scary it is that you say that moritz?

[09:27] <dduncan> regarding X 10.5, a "near final" will be given out on disks this June, with the final supposedly in October

[09:27] <dduncan> the June being WWDC

[09:27] <moritz> demq: no, I don't - what's scary about that?

[09:27] <rgs> it will be late to upgrade

[09:27] <dduncan> but hopefully they don't feature freeze meanwhile

[09:27] <rgs> that's a major version

[09:27] <demq> its a hefty responsibility.

[09:28] <rgs> and there will be a 5.8.9 hopefully

[09:28] <moritz> then is 5.8.9 the release candidate for 5.10?

[09:28] <moritz> s/is/will be/

[09:28] <dduncan> no

[09:29] *** rashakil joined
[09:29] <dduncan> 5.9.x is the release candidate for 5.10

[09:29] <moritz> oh right

[09:29] <moritz> I confused those

[09:29] <dduncan> on that note, hopefully at least 5.9.5 will come out soon

[09:29] <gaal> WWDC == ? Whole world domination convention?

[09:30] <dduncan> Apple's main developer conference

[09:30] <gaal> Ah. I was right then, kinda

[09:30] <dduncan> I went to the one in 2001 on a student scholarship ... had a great time

[09:30] <dduncan> but in the present day I have way more interest in Perl-focused or open source focused conventions

[09:31] <moritz> let's hope they don't dominate the world - MacOS is kinda cute, but the don't take security really serious

[09:31] <dduncan> how do you get that idea?

[09:31] <dduncan> I hear that from FUD-sters

[09:31] <moritz> dduncan: wait, searching for a link...

[09:31] <dduncan> but I don't hear it from people that know anything, usually

[09:32] *** cernd joined
[09:32] <dduncan> of course, the most memorable recent FUD was where Bill Gates himself said that people hack into OS X every single day, while Windows Vista has a much better track record

[09:33] <dduncan> said in an interview around Vista's launch, when an interviewer asked him a comparison question

[09:33] <dduncan> you certainly can't trust companies who sell security software for an unbiased opinion

[09:34] <moritz> dduncan: I read it from a guy who earns his living with code audits, and he applied as security engineer at apple

[09:35] <dduncan> I can understand that there is legitimate criticism, but I also know there is a lot of FUD, and the latter usually gets the press

[09:51] <dduncan> having now read it all, I see the article raised some good points in the start, though at the same time seems to have sabotaged itself in how the interview was handled ... there may be evidence of security practices from looking at the code, but I wouldn't have seen it from the partial interview itself

[09:52] <moritz> dduncan: it's certainly not an overall assessment of macos security, but it points out that things aren't as shiny as they are seen by apple fan boys ;)

[09:52] <dduncan> yes

[18:18] <rindolf> Or at least if it is, it's more than that.

[18:19] <rindolf> One can claim that Perl is a religion too.

[18:19] <rindolf> But it's also a useful tool, a culture, etc.

[18:19] <rindolf> Judaism is also much more than a religion.

[18:19] <rindolf> Back to Perl.

[18:19] * rindolf wants to become the Pope of Perl.

[18:19] <rindolf> The Perl Messiah.

[18:20] <rindolf> Larry is the Perl patriarch (sp?)

[18:20] <moritz> rindolf: you can become the "rindolf" messiah ;-)

[18:20] <rindolf> moritz: ah, that's also OK.

[18:20] <rindolf> But N-T is in fact the anti-thesis of everything religious and mystical.

[18:21] * moritz has written a turing complemete language and interpreter (just as a toy), so now I'm its pope, messiah and implementor ;-)

[18:21] <rindolf> moritz: everyone has written his own Turing-complete language at a point.

[18:21] <rindolf> /me included

[18:21] <moritz> rindolf: well, I did not until recently ;-)

[18:21] <rindolf> Good thing I've still avoided writing my own IRC bot.

[18:22] <rindolf> "Every program becomes more featureful until it can send mail."

[18:22] <elmex> haha, i've been writing multiple irc bots and never released one :-/

[18:22] <moritz> it wouldn't be that hard if only Net::IRC was documented properly ;-)

[18:22] <elmex> there is still Net::IRC3 :->

[18:22] <moritz> elmex: in perl?

[18:22] <elmex> i've written irc bots in C, C++ and Perl

[18:24] <moritz> so it's duplacted effort again *sigh*

[18:25] <elmex> not at all

[18:25] <elmex> Net::IRC3 uses the new AnyEvent module 

[18:25] <moritz> why not?

[18:25] <moritz> I wrote an IRC logger the other day because collabti.de didn't work anymore

[18:26] <rindolf> Most people nowadays use Bot::BasicBot or PoCoIrc

[18:26] <moritz> and I searched for a perl irc logger that I might use, and I couldn't find any

[18:26] <elmex> lol, Net::IRC2 is even mor ebadly documented than Net::IRC

[18:26] <rindolf> I've avoided POE so far.

[18:26] *** ozo joined
[18:26] <elmex> hehe, i don't like POE too. i fell in love with AnyEvent

[18:27] <elmex> heh, ok, Bot::BasicBot is nicer if you don't want to write the botlogic

[18:27] <moritz> POE seems.. a bit heavy at first sight

[18:28] <elmex> not only at first sight

[18:28] <elmex> i've tried it. it's a complete event and io-event solution that imposes a structure on your programs

[18:28] <elmex> some like the framework, some now

[18:28] <elmex> s/now/not/

[18:28] <PerlJam> and will be obsolete or at least *really* simple to implement in Perl6/Parrot  :)

[18:28] <PerlJam> (POE that is)

[18:29] <elmex> yea

[18:29] <PerlJam> elmex: those that don't like POE either don't understand it or they don't understand it  :)

[18:29] * moritz doesn't understand it

[18:29] <PerlJam> It's not a panacea no matter how hard you push it.

[18:30] <elmex> PerlJam: i understand it, and i understood that i dont need it and want to manage things differently 

[18:30] <PerlJam> elmex: excellent!

[18:30] <elmex> i've even used it to write an irc bot once

[18:30] *** jisom joined
[18:30] <elmex> that even performed not too badly

[18:30] <PerlJam> We're TMTOWTDI all the way up and all the way down.

[18:31] <elmex> :-)

[18:31] <rindolf> PerlJam: Uri Guttman said he's working on his own POE replacement.

[18:31] <elmex> cool

[18:31] <elmex> lol

[18:31] <PerlJam> rindolf: you're talking about stem?

[18:31] <rindolf> In the latest Perlcast interview with him.

[18:31] <moritz> yey, more implementations ;-)

[18:31] <rindolf> PerlJam:  I don't remember.

[18:31] <rindolf> I wrote my own CMS, though.

[18:32] <rindolf> But it's an offline CMS.

[18:32] <PerlJam> stem really isn't a POE replacement IMHO.

[18:32] <moritz> rindolf: I did, too ;-)

[18:32] <elmex> reinventing the wheel is a nice thing, because they might become rounder than before :)

[18:32] <awwaiid> or pointier... if you're into that sort of thing

[18:32] <PerlJam> stem and POE are more like different philosophies of a similar idea.  But sometimes which philosophy you choose matters.

[18:32] <rindolf> elmex: "He who re-invents the wheel, may actually invent a much better wheel".

[18:33] <elmex> right

[18:33] <elmex> that was what i meant

[18:33] <moritz> actually I didn't want to write my own offline CMS, but I haven't found a suitable one

[18:33] <rindolf> elmex: yes, I got you.

[18:33] <rindolf> I was quoting myself.

[18:33] <elmex> heh, k

[18:33] <moritz> so the problem seems to be to find the software

[18:33] <elmex> my enlgihs sucks at times, so i'm often not sure wheter ppl get me

[18:33] <rindolf> moritz: my CMS grew out of the WML logic I copied and pasted to create my own sites.

[18:34] <rindolf> moritz: and eventually concentrated it into one thing.

[18:34] <rindolf> Which took some work, but was well worth it because I had less duplicate code.

[18:34] <rindolf> I'm not sure too many people are using Latemp (my CMS) now.

[18:34] <rindolf> But it's all there.

[20:18] <dduncan> it seems that misc/Pyrl6 is borked again on case-insensitive systems ... it contains both a Pyrl.py and pyrl.py

[20:19] <dduncan> therefore, on my box, even with a fresh pull and revert -R of the repository, svk status shows Pyrl.py as being modified when it wasn't, and so a commit could accidentally break that in the repo

[20:24] *** fglock joined

[20:24] <moritz> avar: macos x uses case insesitve filesystems by default as well

[20:25] <avar> (mac os x)--

[20:25] <veritos> fixed, the config should be taken care of soon.

[20:25] <veritos> good to see people caring about it tho

[20:26] *** Odin-FOO joined
[20:27] <veritos> anyway Pyrl.py (the library) will be going away soon.

[20:36] <veritos> what happened to the svnbot?

[20:46] <fglock_> if an object has a FETCH method, is it automatically considered a container? is FETCH called by default?

[20:49] <dduncan> Mac OS X is what I'm using, as with a lot of us ... now I could probably reformat my disks case-sensitive, but I don't know what side-effects that may have for some programs

[20:50] <moritz> dduncan: no, don't do that ;-)

[20:52] <fglock_> for example: does this calls FETCH?  ( function_that_returns_an_object_that_can_FETCH() + 1 )

[20:55] <veritos> so what have the people who have so far seen Pyrl thought?

[20:56] <fglock_> veritos: sorry, haven't looked yet,

[20:56] <fglock_> but do you think it can be made to run mp6 code?

[20:57] <fglock_> that would be nice

[20:57] <veritos> fglock_: once i get rules up-and-running it should be no problem.

[20:57] <fglock_> mp6 doesn't need rules, it has it's own engine

[20:58] <veritos> fglock_: so i just need a tokenizer and parser?

[20:58] <veritos> i'll try later today.

[20:58] <fglock_> yes, and a minimal runtime

[20:58] <veritos> fglock_: of course...

[20:58] <veritos> i need to go though...bye.

[21:00] *** fglock left
[21:00] *** fglock_ left
[21:00] *** fglock joined
[21:04] <fglock> I'm a bit confused about when to call FETCH; I guess I'll create a separate 'call-method' for containers,

[21:04] <fglock> which means, for FETCH to be called automatically, the object must inherit/do 'Container'

[21:37] <veritos> oh, also a question on the current channel topic: isn't reverse . show $ scanl (*) 1 [1..] !! 4 a bit cleaner?

[21:38] <moritz> > reverse . show $ scanl (*) 1 [1..] !! 4

[21:38] <lambdabot>  "42"

[21:38] <moritz> haskell will always be a secret to me

[21:40] <jrockway> > 2 + 2 where 2 + 2 = 42

[21:40] <lambdabot>  Parse error

[21:40] <veritos> reverse (show yada) = reverse . show yada = (.) reverse show yada

[21:40] <veritos> 2 + 2 where (+) 2 2 = 42

[21:40] <veritos> > 2 + 2 where (+) 2 2 = 42

[21:40] <jrockway> it works in ghci...

[21:40] <jrockway> (uh, and ghc of course :)

[21:40] <veritos> >(+) 2 2 where (+) x y = 42

[21:41] <jrockway> i'm apparently wrong btw

[21:41] <jrockway> ENOTENOUGHHASKELLRECENTLY

[21:41] <veritos> in the definition you have to do it prefix i think

[21:42] <jrockway> nah, pattern matching

[21:42] <veritos> > let (+) 2 2 = 42 in + 2 2

[21:42] <lambdabot>  Parse error

[21:42] <jrockway> why am i thinking of where though

[21:42] * jrockway finds my slides where i did this and it works

[21:42] <moritz> (+) 2 2 where (+) x y = 42 works in hugs

[21:42] <veritos> hmm. ((+)2)2

[21:42] <veritos> > ((+)2)2

[21:43] <veritos> > ( ( + ) 2 ) 2

[21:43] <veritos> urgh. it should work... (+) :: Num -> Num -> Num
