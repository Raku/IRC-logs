[10:28] <dduncan> moritz, is that so ... it seems to work for me ... looking ...

[10:28] <moritz> dduncan: perhaps you forgot to commit a script?

[10:29] <dduncan> the latest smoke I saw on smokserv also showed passing tests

[10:29] <dduncan> looking ...

[10:30] <dduncan> QDRDBMS is technically very simple, it is just Perl 6 modules and Perl 6 test files ... no special scripts required

[10:31] <dduncan> that said, if Pugs itself changed recently, I may not have built the last few patches in ... will try remake

[10:33] <moritz> dduncan: it seems more like an error with the test: make target...

[10:33] <diakopter> moritz: it might be that this build of QDRDBMS failed b/c the previous build of pugs failed...?

[10:34] <dduncan> what I usually do for testing is cding into ext/QDRDBMS and saying 'make test', and the tests all pass

[10:34] <moritz> dduncan: http://paste.debian.net/25506

[10:34] <dduncan> due to how Pugs is setup, that just works, and is like a subset of the normal make test

[10:34] <moritz> diakopter: no, the prev. pugs build succeeded

[10:34] <dduncan> anyway, I just did a full Pugs remake

[10:34] <dduncan> that is, pull, 'make'

[10:35] <dduncan> the full make, and the test in just my dir succeeded

[10:36] <dduncan> perhaps your build is messed up ... does this happen for any other ext/ ?

[10:36] <dduncan> that said, I have a theory, looking ...

[10:38] <dduncan> nope, not that ... I don't see how I'm doing anything differently from other ext/ that work

[10:39] <moritz> dduncan: most other tests in ext/ succeed for me, and they don't complain about missing scripts

[10:39] <dduncan> do any other ext/ give the same error?

[10:40] <dduncan> is there someone else here, diakopter perhaps, can you please try running 'make test' on QDRDBMS yourself and check the results?

[10:40] <dduncan> as per moritz nopaste

[10:40] <dduncan> just cd into ext/QDRDBMS/ and then say 'make test', assuming you have a recent full Pugs 'make' that worked

[10:41] <dduncan> "full" meaning the result of running "make" when you are in the root Pugs dir

[10:42] <dduncan> moritz, you shouldn't have any blib dirs under ext/ dirs anyway

[10:43] <dduncan> the only blib/ should be under the Pugs root dir, and that is where all ext/ modules are pulled during Pugs 'make'

[10:43] <dduncan> your error seems to be looking for a dir that shouldn't be there

[10:44] <moritz> dduncan: ok, I deleted blib/, made "make" in the pugs root, and now the tests work

[10:44] <moritz> sorry for the fuzz

[10:44] <dduncan> no problem, glad you got it working for you

[10:45] <dduncan> oh and fyi, any day now I will be adding more *.pm files to QDRDBMS, and so I believe the main Pugs Makefile.PL would have to be subsequently rerun in order for them to be moved to the /blib so the tests work after that

[10:45] <avar> 10:45:23  * CPAN upload: Perl6-Perldoc-v0.0.3 by DCONWAY

[14:23] <moritz> do ^^ and $$ have a meaning in p5 regex?

[14:24] <rgs> no

[14:25] <moritz> but ^^ matches an empty string, right?

[14:25] <rgs> certainly

[14:25] <moritz> so there's no way of introducing ^^ and $$ to p5 regex without breaking anything :(

[14:25] <rgs> esp. $$

[14:26] <rgs> since that interpolates to the pid

[14:26] <moritz> right

[14:26] <avar> you could write a re::engine::

[14:26] <PerlJam> I wouldn't worry too much about such breakage.

[14:26] <rgs> avar: hahaha

[14:26] <moritz> avar: no, I can't ;-)

[14:26] <PerlJam> How often is a program matchign it's own PID?

[14:27] <avar> You still have to worry about it because your engine will get some integer and not "$$"

[14:27] <rgs> it can look it up in `ps` for example

[14:27] <PerlJam> And how often does someone actually use ^^ in a RE?  (never)

[14:27] <avar> so you need /^^ \$$/ 

[14:27] <moritz> PerlJam: that's convenient if you filter the output of ps aux or something ;-)

[14:27] <PerlJam> Sure, but what I'm saying is that he benefits outweight the breakage.

[14:27] <PerlJam> s/weight/weigh/

[14:28] <avar> You don't have to break anything at all to add new regex engines in 5.10

[14:28] <PerlJam> oh, that's right.

[14:28] <PerlJam> use feature '^^';

[14:28] <PerlJam> or whatever

[14:28] <avar> no, use re::engine::PCR # or something

[14:29] <PerlJam> Either way.  I would worry even less about the breakage  ;-)

[14:29] <avar>     if ("abc" =~ /((.).)./) {

[14:29] <avar>         say ${^MATCH};           # "abc"

[14:29] <avar>         say ${^MATCH}->from;     # 0

[14:29] <avar>         say ${^MATCH}->to;       # 3

[14:29] <moritz> so how many re engines will be distributed with 5.10?

[14:29] <rgs> one

[14:29] <avar> two:)

[14:29] <rgs> well, with the debug one, two

[14:29] <avar> >:)

[14:30] <moritz> but there are other available as CPAN modules?

[14:30] <avar> yep, I've done re::engine::POSIX and Plan9, and Plugin

[14:30] <avar> all of them are broken now though, the interface in blead is a bit unstable atm:)

[14:30] <moritz> sounds cool

[14:30] <avar> PCRE too

[14:30] <avar> but that's not mine

[14:30] <PerlJam> that's just sick

[14:38] <jerrylee> and, what is the most required part for community contribution?

[14:42] <kolibrie> jerrylee: linking tests to the synopsis is a good way to both learn Perl 6 and help the community

[14:42] <moritz> jerrylee: what do you mean by "learn pugs systematically?" pugs internals?

[14:43] <PerlJam> the only way to learn about pugs' guts is to start digging around in them  I think.

[14:43] <jerrylee> moritz: programming on pugs ;) 

[14:43] <jerrylee> I might put focus on further perl6 modules

[14:44] <moritz> jerrylee: first read docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod

[14:44] <PerlJam> jerrylee: to learn how to use pugs is to learn how to use perl6 (mostly)

[14:44] <moritz> jerrylee: then the specs

[14:44] <moritz> and hope that pugs implements what you want to use ;-)

[14:45] <jerrylee> :) i guess it is becoming what i want to use

[14:46] <jerrylee> i wish maybe on perl6 we have something like ruby on rails ..

[14:46] <moritz> jerrylee: we will have catalyst on perl6

[14:49] <avar> yes, it doesn't suck

[14:50] <jerrylee> we are developing on cakephp, mvc framework, and it's good for web app

[14:50] <moritz> avar: no insult intended ;)

[14:52] <jerrylee> moritz: catalyst looks interesting

[14:54] *** bonesss is now known as bones[almoco]

[14:56] <moritz> jerrylee: it _is_ ;-)

[15:12] <PerlJam> Hopefully perl6 will get "killer apps" like RoR/Catalyst soon after its release.

[15:12] <PerlJam> (or maybe even before :)

[15:12] <moritz> before, yes ;-)

[15:14] *** penk joined
[15:19] <PerlJam> I went to a talk at SXSW by ppk (see http://www.quirksmode.org/) where he claimed that javascript will eventually disappear in the same way that asm has disappeared.  No one will write in it.  RoR validates his theory in some way because it's all about writing ruby code to implement functionality.

[15:19] <lambdabot> Title: QuirksMode - for all your browser quirks

[15:19] <jerrylee> that will be excellent

[15:19] *** Psyche^ joined
[15:19] <PerlJam> I think Perl 6 validates that idea as well in that it subsumes much of the functionality that has historically been relegated elsewhere.

[15:19] <jerrylee> because perl6 + parrot + catalyst is too good to be true!!

[15:20] <moritz> PerlJam: I think that's a bad comparison. JS is a high level language, and there are cases where people don't have server side scripting support, so they'll fallback to JS for some tasks

[15:21] <PerlJam> I mean perl6 will make javascript fade into the background and SQL and other things just like perl5 made grotty shell scripts fade into the background (once we grew a bunch of perl5 experts)

[15:21] <moritz> ok, "fade into background" is a term I can live with ;-)

[15:22] <PerlJam> good :)

[15:22] <moritz> and I won't shed a tear - js is generally hard to write and to debug IMHO

[15:23] <jerrylee> so what's perl6 progress now? when will be pugs become perl6?

[15:23] <PerlJam> jerrylee: it won't probably.

[15:24] <PerlJam> jerrylee: pugs may become the bootstrap environment to write perl6 in perl6 (maybe)

[15:25] <jerrylee> PerlJam: when is it going to happen?

[15:25] <jerrylee> anything we can help?

[15:26] <PerlJam> I am absolutely the wrong person to answer that question.  :-)

[15:26] <moritz> jerrylee: there's plenty of things you can help with - writing test cases, docs, raising funds, hacking pugs' internals...

[15:26] <moritz> jerrylee: helping the parrot folks...

[15:26] <PerlJam> jerrylee: listen to moritz 

[15:27] <kolibrie> jerrylee: pick something you like and have fun!

[15:27] <moritz> jerrylee: you could help fglock with his mp6/kp6 efforts (perl6 compiler written in a subset of perl6)

[15:27] <jerrylee> moritz: hacking, ok :)

[15:27] <jerrylee> ok :)

[15:28] <moritz> jerrylee: under src/perl6/ there are beginnings of perl6 implementation in perl6, currently most prominent is a grammar for perl6

[15:28] <jerrylee> how can i find fglock

[15:28] <PerlJam> jerrylee: perl6 is probably in chrysalis stage right now.  Its butteryfly is eminent.  (Hopefully it lives a lot longer than a real butterfly ;-)

[15:29] <moritz> @seen fglock

[15:29] <lambdabot> I saw fglock leaving #perl6 17h 57m 28s ago, and .

[15:38] <[particle]> yes, once it's implemented

[15:39] <jerrylee> [particle]: as i know python and basic can run on parrot already?

[15:39] <[particle]> basic is broken

[15:39] <jerrylee> i see

[15:40] <[particle]> python is partially implemented, like all high-level languages

[15:40] <[particle]> we have the ability to export globals from one namespace to another

[15:41] <[particle]> but nobody has written something that loads one languages' globals into another's

[15:42] <jerrylee> how about pugs? i saw it runs on parrot 

[15:42] <jerrylee> but it runs as a standalone also?

[15:42] <moritz> jerrylee: no, it doesn not _run_ on parrot

[15:43] <moritz> jerrylee: it's a stand-alone executable, that embeds perl5 (and ghc?)

[18:35] <lichtkind> as a star child i cannot die like a time lord

[18:35] <moritz> just like a friend of mine, vim user, who got an "emacs reference" mug from his sister...

[18:55] <lumi> Does anyone know the Common Lisp FORMAT function? Maybe there's some idea to be sto^Wresearched there

[18:58] <kolibrie> I do not know it, but it has been mentioned before, so now I am intrigued, but not enough to look at it yet

[18:59] <lumi> The printf in p6l reminded me; it's basically a DSL for printing deep data structures

[19:00] <moritz> sounds like a good task for a core module ;-)

[19:00] <lumi> I think so, printf is so.. C

[19:01] <lumi> "Complex FORMAT control strings sometimes bear a suspicious resemblance to line noise"

[19:07] <[particle]> perl 6 has a replacement for perl 5 formats

[19:08] <lumi> [particle]: What's that? Also, this isn't like Perl 5 formats

[19:09] <lumi> It's more like a smarter printf

[19:10] <[particle]> it's called 'form'

[19:51] <obra> folks: we've got these lovely perl6 microgrants to give out

[19:51] <obra> More pugs hackers need to apply

[20:01] * geoffb gets the feeling he's not alone

[20:03] *** Aankhen`` joined
[20:06] <obra> $500. 1 month of hackery.

[20:06] <obra> these don't need to be big projects

[20:07] <Tene> obra: perhaps gather some suggestions of projects people would like to see done.

[20:10] <zamolxes> obra: writing a working useful thing in perl6 ?

[20:10] <zamolxes> i wanted to do this for fun anyway :)

[20:10] *** wilx joined
[20:11] <obra> zamolxes: quite possibly, especially if you're writing good tests and docs and posting it publicly ;)

[20:12] <zamolxes> i'll probably delegate the stuff to my team and buy a shitload of beer (if any grant is .. granted) 

[20:12] <zamolxes> i always wanted to show them perl6

[20:12] <obra> :)

[20:17] <Tene> obra: I have time available, I just don't have any interesting ideas.

[20:18] <obra> Tene: what have you been doing with pugs so far?

[20:18] <obra> Do you hack haskell? 

[20:18] <moritz> maybe a foreign code interface?

[20:18] <moritz> or at least some preparations for that

[20:18] <Tene> Never worked with haskell.

[20:19] <obra> moritz: you mean like the current p5 stuff?

[20:19] <moritz> obra: yes ;-)

[20:19] <Tene> I've played around with some web development stuff, mostly.

[20:19] *** beppu joined
[20:20] <moritz> Tene: Juerd (iirc) had some good ideas about a replacement for CGI in perl6...

[20:20] <diakopter> obra: how many mini-grants/month have become available, if I may ask?

[20:20] <moritz> Tene: if you want to code in perl6 that might be a good idea

[20:20] <obra> we've got about 8 more to go right now

[20:21] <Tene> moritz: I remember seeing that...

[20:22] <Tene> That could be fun to work on.

[20:22] <moritz> I think that's a good idea because perl has traditionally strong on webservers...

[20:23] <moritz> so it would be good to have a working, good module as early as possible

[20:23] <Tene> I don't have any idea how to quantify that into a month or so of work with clearly-defined success, though.

[20:25] <moritz> Tene: I'd suggest you contact Juerd or darren duncan (he commited the placeholder ext/Web) and ask for ideas

[20:25] <obra> possibly a minimal subset of jifty, catalyst or rails ported to p6.

[20:31] <diakopter> obra - a port of qpsmtpd or another high-performance network server to p6?

[20:32] <diakopter> perlbal perhaps

[20:32] * Tene will investigate ideas this weekend.

[21:10] *** buetow joined
[21:15] *** the_dormant joined
[21:21] <moritz> I have two ideas about documentation projects...

[21:22] <moritz> 1) the specs are written as a diff to perl5, it would be nice to have a non-diff version (at least of some of the specs)

[21:22] *** bonesss joined
[21:22] <moritz> especially since perl5 is not very formally specced

[21:23] *** cognominal joined
[21:23] <moritz> 2) beginner's tutorial. I don't think the core language will change so much, so you could already start with that

[21:28] <diakopter> moritz: http://www.learningperl6.com/llama6_proposal.pod   brian d foy has recently posted some documentation-driven questions on a list somewhere

[21:28] <brian_d_f> I'm working on the file test operator chapter right now. It's in the SVN but not the webiste yet

[21:30] <moritz> so is intended to be both a book and the perldoc pages?

[21:30] <brian_d_f> I'm just writing Learning Perl 6

[21:31] <brian_d_f> I might be able to help with some of the perldoc stuff, but it's not my main goal righ tnow

[21:31] <diakopter> brian_d_f: aww, you're writing in pod5...

[21:31] <brian_d_f> I'd really like to see a single, definitive source. I think that's supposed to be the synopses

[21:32] <brian_d_f> heh, because I have a lot of translators for pod5 already

[21:32] <brian_d_f> and ORA has translators that go from pod5 to their internal system

[21:33] <brian_d_f> I'm trying to pretend that pod6 isn't wiki-like so I don't slit my wrists

[21:33] <Limbic_Region> brian_d_f - the synopses, as you know, are still being written.  Additionally, some of the stuff pitched over the fence to parrot land are still being worked out

[21:34] <brian_d_f> yep, they're still being written :)

[21:34] <Limbic_Region> brian_d_f - looking in docs/perl6 is a great place to see synopses as works in progress

[21:34] <buu> brian_d_f: We're actually close enough to start working on learning perl6?

[21:34] <diakopter> somebody thinks so, apparently

[21:34] <Limbic_Region> brian_d_f - I am not sure if TimToady and @larry are re-thinking this pitch stuff over the wall to parrot but I think they should

[21:34] <brian_d_f> um, I don't know if we're close enough

[21:34] <brian_d_f> but I am working on it

[21:34] <Limbic_Region> since it is obvious that multiple implementations will exist even if the one targeting parrot is "official"

[21:35] <diakopter> somebody meaning the sponsor(s)/publisher

[21:35] <brian_d_f> a learning book only covers the 80% useful stuff

[21:35] <Limbic_Region> actually, Randal said it much more candidly

[21:35] <brian_d_f> and most of that stuff is set: variables, files, rules

[21:35] <moritz> what about OO?

[21:36] <Limbic_Region> brian_d_f - the biggest thing that I think is going to be hard to write in Learning Perl 6 isn't about the commands and syntax, but more about the philosophy

[21:36] <brian_d_f> there will be some OO stuff, but only user level stuff, not class creation and that other fun stuff

[21:36] <brian_d_f> that's Intermediate Perl ^

[21:36] * Limbic_Region disagrees on that point

[21:36] <brian_d_f> yep, philosophy is hard

[21:36] <Limbic_Region> only because the philosophy of perl 6 has changed

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> in p5, oo was definately an intermediate book item

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> not so in p6 (IMO)

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> OO is baked in from the get go

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> and while a great deal of effort is being made to allow you to ignore it

[21:37] <moritz> syntax and semantic is (mostly) well specced, but philosophy isn't ;-)

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> just about everything can be treated like an object

[21:37] <brian_d_f> OO as a topic is not the same as making classes

[21:37] <brian_d_f> and that sort of stuff

[21:37] <Limbic_Region> *shrug*, I guess

[21:37] <moritz> so you have to think for yourself and can't just look it up

[21:38] <brian_d_f> i'll see what happens. personally i like the OO stuff

[21:38] <Limbic_Region> that's why I said the philosophy of perl 6 is going to be the hardest part to get right in the learning perl 6 book (which is where it is needed)

[21:38] <brian_d_f> it's what we can teach in 350 pages and have people learn in 4 days that matters for Llama 6 though

[21:38] <Limbic_Region> there was a lot of years and experience to go on before the first learning perl book

[21:39] <brian_d_f> yeah, it's a challenge, but I'm not scared of that

[21:39] * Limbic_Region wasn't trying to scare you

[21:39] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[21:40] <brian_d_f> and the OO stuff at this level isn't new, just new to Perl

[21:41] <brian_d_f> the book will be online as I write it, so there will be plenty of time for people to make comments :)

[21:41] <brian_d_f> I keep saying I when I mean we (Randal and I)

[21:41] <Limbic_Region> I wouldn't worry about that too much

[21:42] <Limbic_Region> It isn't like Randal will leave anyone wondering about his contributions

[21:42] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[21:42] <Limbic_Region> so out of curiosity, is MMD in or out?

[21:43] <brian_d_f> MMD in Llama 6? No idea yet.

[21:43] <Limbic_Region> actually, that should be MMD/MFD I think

[21:43] <Limbic_Region> since perl 6 will specifically distinguish between methods and subroutines

[21:43] <brian_d_f> I'm workign from the back of the book to see what needs to be in the front

[21:44] <brian_d_f> haven't thought about that yet. focus focus focus :)

[21:44] *** dduncan joined
[21:44] <Limbic_Region> well, I will leave you be then

[21:44] <brian_d_f> we probably won't have method creation in Llama 6 though

[21:44] <Limbic_Region> it has been something I have been thinking about for about 2 years myself

[21:45] <brian_d_f> i would like to see other beginning Perl 6 books though, written from other perspectivesw

[21:45] <brian_d_f> one book isn't going to work for everyone

[21:45] <Limbic_Region> well, the book I am thinking about isn't about perl specifically, nor perl 6

[21:46] <Limbic_Region> but all actual code is in p5 or p6 (and possibly other languages as comparisons)

[21:47] * Limbic_Region was supposed to work on said book while his family was in the Philippines but with a little over a week to go it doesn't look like it is going to happen

[21:47] <Limbic_Region> all research, lists of ideas to cover, etc but only a chapter or two actually written

[21:48] <moritz> Limbic_Region: so you are thinking about a "programming for beginners" book that happens to use perl6?

[21:48] <Limbic_Region> no, not at all

[21:48] <Limbic_Region> mortiz - it isn't even a beginners book at all

[21:48] <brian_d_f> that would be a good book, but also a book on "Perl 6 for Not Beginners"

[21:50] <moritz> Limbic_Region: so what's the (imaginary) audience?

[21:51] <Limbic_Region> moritz - primarily self-taught programmers, sys admins suddenly being asked to maintain scripts they didn't right, professional developers that don't have the benefit of a CS degree

[21:51] <moritz> Limbic_Region: I'll read it! ;-)

[21:51] <Limbic_Region> s/right/write/

[21:52] <Limbic_Region> moritz - well, I pitched the idea to O'Reilly over a year ago and we were just about to negotiate a contract when I backed out

[21:52] <moritz> Limbic_Region: why?

[21:52] <Limbic_Region> moritz - life intervened (my wife was pregnant with our first daughter)

[21:52] <moritz> Limbic_Region: that's a _really_ good reason ;-)

[21:52] <Limbic_Region> I'm not in the business of commiting to things I know I can't do - and family comes first

[21:52] *** demq joined
[21:53] <Limbic_Region> so I have continued to do research, jot down ideas, organize the arrangement of the chapters, etc

[21:53] <Limbic_Region> I talk to Allison and chromatic about it every so often

[21:54] <Limbic_Region> but writing a book (and doing it right) is hard work that takes a lot of time

[21:54] <Limbic_Region> thinking is much easier

[21:54] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[21:57] <Limbic_Region> speaking of not having the benefit of a CS degree - does anyone have some introductory links to graph theory?

[21:58] <zamolxes> Limbic_Region: the wolf book is nice ;)

[21:58] <zamolxes> http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/maperl/

[21:58] <lambdabot> Title: O'Reilly Media -- Bookstore: Mastering Algorithms with Perl

[21:59] <Limbic_Region> zamolxes - you misunderstand then

[21:59] * Limbic_Region owns that book

[22:00] <zamolxes> mee too :) . how introductory?

[22:00] <zamolxes> wikipedia has a lot of stuff, I don't know

[22:00] <Limbic_Region> zamolxes - I'm not interested in code at all, rather the theory.

[22:01] <Limbic_Region> I am trying to turn what I have in my head into something else

[22:01] <Limbic_Region> zamolxes - I need a way to take someone who doesn't have anything to relate to

[22:02] <Limbic_Region> and get them to see a problem in terms of a graph, and how various different graph algorithms can solve the problem they are asking

[22:02] <zamolxes> well most theory starts with the mathematical definition 

[22:02] <Limbic_Region> zamolxes - turning a problem not presented as a graph into that situation isn't easy

[22:02] <Limbic_Region> especially for one who never learned it in school

[22:03] <Limbic_Region> IOW - I don't want to tell you how to do it or show you how I do it, I want you to be able to figure out how to do it ;-)

[22:03] <Limbic_Region> the first 2 I can do, the 3rd I am having a hard time with

[22:03] <Limbic_Region> *shrug* - not like I have a deadline or anything

[22:05] <zamolxes> think of tree traversal. you need those every other day

[22:05] <zamolxes> (nested categories etc)

[22:06] * Limbic_Region hates artificial examples

[22:06] <zamolxes> think of route optimising (everyone trying to plan deliveries for an online delivery business) 

[22:06] <Limbic_Region> so yeah

[22:06] <Limbic_Region> perhaps that's the way to go

[22:06] <Limbic_Region> just pick a few examples and solve it several different ways

[22:07] <zamolxes> well i'm thinking these are real world uses, not artificial

[22:07] <Limbic_Region> no, you misunderstand

[22:07] <Limbic_Region> I was leading in to a compliment

[22:07] <zamolxes> i keep doing that

[22:07] <Limbic_Region> well, I think that's more my fault than yours.

[22:08] <Limbic_Region> I agree with your examples as good ones that people can relate to rather than an academic one which no one can apply to their real work

[22:08] * Limbic_Region hugs zamolxes

[22:14] <lambdabot> audreyt: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[22:15] <Limbic_Region> oh, audreyt - is she ok?

[22:28] *** dunstabulos joined
[22:29] <zamolxes> Limbic_Region: imagine wanting to know who can read an email sent to [email@hidden.address] having a huge graph of aliases

[22:29] <zamolxes> it's a very common request

[22:30] <zamolxes> what possible entry points do you have for this particular mailbox?

[22:30] <zamolxes> etc

[22:30] <zamolxes> of course this is 'interesting' and 'non academic' just for a sysadmin :)

[22:31] <geoffb> Email aliases actually give lots of graphy needs: "Did <user1> get an email sent to <foo>?"  "Are there any potential loops in these aliases?"  "What is the maximum number of emails that would receive a message sent to one of these lists?" and so on?
