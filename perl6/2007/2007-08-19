[23:30] <dduncan> question: about a month ago, I was referred to a page with instructions on installing ghc on Mac OS X, which worked then, but now that I have to do it again, I don't recall where the page was, and the pugs web log is missing a log for the day in question

[23:30] <dduncan> I don't mean where to get ghc or 2 frameworks it depends on

[23:30] <dduncan> but any other special instructions, like special config settings to do, if necessary

[23:30] *** fglock left
[23:31] <dduncan> note that 'ghc' itself runs after I thought I got it right, but pugs makefile fails

[23:31] <dduncan> saying things like: /usr/bin/ld: table of contents for archive: /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.6.1/libHSCabal.a is out of date; rerun ranlib(1) (can't load from it)

[23:31] *** bsb joined
[23:31] <dduncan> since the pugs checkout dir didn't otherwise change, save for new commits, I thought it may be a ghc misinstall thing, so perhaps the instructions may clear it up

[23:32] <dduncan> seen audreyt

[23:32] <buubot> dduncan: Sorry, I haven't seen audreyt

[23:33] <dduncan> pointers appreciated

[23:34] <Eidolos> dduncan: you'll probably have better luck in #haskell

[23:34] <dduncan> that's a thought ... will try

[23:44] <dduncan> seen audreyt_

[23:44] <buubot> dduncan: Sorry, I haven't seen audreyt_

[23:44] <dduncan> I'm talking in #haskell too, but nothing yet

[23:52] <dduncan> as an update, I actually did try to look up the instructions given a month ago, but the #perl6 channel log I was using was missing 2 days ... however, I seem to have found another logger with the missing info, so looking there now ...
