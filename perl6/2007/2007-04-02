[02:36] <mugwump> much better than ␊

[02:37] * TimToady bows

[02:40] <mugwump> So, whilst learning Te Reo Māori I had a "aha!" moment when I realised it has the same sentence structure as lojban, but uses named rather than numbered arguments to its verbs

[02:41] <TimToady> sounds like a fairly normal case system

[02:41] <TimToady> prepositions fill a similar role

[02:42] <TimToady> I always thought lojban's numbered args were quite illogical

[02:42] <mugwump> Insane!  How on earth are you supposed to intuitively grasp them

[02:43] <mugwump> It would be more like a way for adults to speak over children

[02:43] <Tene> TimToady: howso?

[02:44] <TimToady> each verb has different slots, and there didn't seem to be much regularity to it.

[02:44] <TimToady> but I haven't looked at it in a long time

[06:58] <Aankhen``> What is a buf8?

[06:58] <Aankhen``> Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but I can't seem to find an explanation of this. :-S My understanding is that it's a low-level type used for representing strings, but not much else...

[07:00] <QtPlatypus> Aankhen``: I think its in S02.pod

[07:01] <Aankhen``> Seen it mentioned there, but I don't think it explained much.  I'll take a look at it again in case I missed it.

[07:02] <Aankhen``> Oh.  Durr.  There we go.  I didn't miss it, I just conveniently ignored it.

[07:02] <QtPlatypus> And http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S09.html also covers it.

[07:02] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 9: Data Structures - perl6:

[07:02] <Aankhen``> I suppose what I really want to know is, what does the 8 indicate?

[07:03] <dduncan> 8 bits

[07:03] <Aankhen``> Does that mean a buf8 can only contain eight bits?

[07:03] <dduncan> a buf is like a compact array

[07:03] <dduncan> each array elem is 8 bits

[07:03] <Aankhen``> Ahhhh.

[07:03] <Aankhen``> It makes sense now.

[07:03] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[07:03] <dduncan> eg, like what a typical string is in C

[07:03] <Aankhen``> I kept looking at HTTP::Message's has buf8 $.content, and kept wondering how the content would fit into 8 bits.

[07:04] * Aankhen`` looks sheepish.

[07:06] <QtPlatypus> dduncan: However when moving buf8's to C we will still have to postpend a null?

[07:06] <Aankhen``> I think I'll take a stab at filling out Web::Tags a bit.

[07:09] <dduncan> it depends how you would use it in C

[07:09] <dduncan> I think the only things that care about null are certain string operators

[07:09] <Aankhen``> role Foo { our &bar = method (...) { ... }; } # is this the right way to put a dynamically created method in any class that .does(Foo)?

[07:10] <dduncan> in any event, all Perl built-in types with lower-case names are meant to be like hardware-level unboxed types

[07:10] <dduncan> in that their behaviour is architecture dependent rather than portable

[07:10] <dduncan> but the trade off is you can get better speed or memory efficiency

[07:10] *** rfordinal joined
[07:11] <dduncan> the Buf type is the boxed portable version of the compact array

[14:12] <DarkWolf84> the same error

[14:12] <DarkWolf84> :(

[14:12] <DarkWolf84> maybe it's not because threads

[14:19] <DarkWolf84> nad it says that some refs r not defined

[14:20] <DarkWolf84> like p5embed.c:(.text+0x6cd): undefined reference to `Perl_Gsigfpe_saved_ptr'

[14:26] <moritz> DarkWolf84: which p5 version do you use?

[14:26] <DarkWolf84> w8 a moment

[14:27] <DarkWolf84> 5.8.8-i686-linux-thread-multi

[14:28] <DarkWolf84> maybe is package problem

[14:28] <DarkWolf84> coz I 'm with gentoo

[14:29] <DarkWolf84> and maybe some pakages r broken

[14:32] <moritz> ... and gentoo is generally broken *duck* 

[14:32] <andara> DarkWolf84: looks like a linker error. Maybe the build script doesn't find your libperl.so

[14:32] <DarkWolf84> ok

[14:33] <andara> usually it's under /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i486-linux, but if you built it yourself it might be somewhere else

[14:36] <moritz> andara: or just under /usr/lib ;-)

[14:37] <DarkWolf84> i think i found the problem

[14:37] <DarkWolf84> i have perl and libperl tarball

[14:38] <DarkWolf84> maybe I have to recompile the libperl

[14:40] <andara> DarkWolf84: you can try to grep your existing libperl.so for Perl_Gsigfpe_saved_ptr. If it's there, the lib is probaly ok

[14:41] <DarkWolf84> the problem is that I have recompiled perl with threads

[14:42] *** xdg joined

[14:48] <DarkWolf84> I found my mistake

[17:59] <DarkWolf84> simple server

[17:59] <perlmonkey2> very cool

[17:59] <DarkWolf84> which repeats anything u say

[17:59] <perlmonkey2> simple socket server then?

[17:59] <perlmonkey2> and client?

[17:59] <DarkWolf84> no only server

[18:00] <DarkWolf84> I used telnet to test it

[18:00] <perlmonkey2> probably will wind up in the Camel Perl 6 book :P

[18:00] <DarkWolf84> I don't have this book

[18:01] <moritz> DarkWolf84: use "err die" instead of "or die"

[18:01] <DarkWolf84> ok

[18:01] <DarkWolf84> shuld I change it

[18:01] <perlmonkey2> does "err die" imply implicit exception handling?

[18:02] <moritz> iirc not

[18:02] <moritz> but it's the "more idiomatic" way ;-)

[18:02] <DarkWolf84> ok next time I'll use err 

[18:05] <moritz> hey, perl6.vim syntax hilighting doesn't hilights async as a key word

[18:06] <DarkWolf84> lol

[18:07] <DarkWolf84> gedit don't hilight many commands

[18:08] <DarkWolf84> perl6 is evolving every day

[18:08] <moritz> DarkWolf84: gedit probably uses perl5 syntax hilighting

[18:08] *** prly joined
[18:08] <DarkWolf84> right

[18:09] <perlmonkey2> So in Perl 6 failures don't return 0 but instead return ()?

[18:09] <DarkWolf84> what is ()?

[18:09] <perlmonkey2> undefined

[18:10] <moritz> perlmonkey2: I don't know.. in one of the synopsis it says "TODO: research error handling system" or something similar...

[18:10] <perlmonkey2> 'err' is '//' while 'or' is '||'

[18:10] <moritz> perlmonkey2: looks as if it's not fully specced

[18:11] <DarkWolf84> i didn't know the word for // is err

[18:11] <moritz> perhaps foo err bar is short for try { foo }; on error bar

[18:11] <perlmonkey2> that would be VERY cool.

[18:11] <moritz> perlmonkey2: what?

[18:11] <DarkWolf84> no more 0 problems

[18:11] <DarkWolf84> :)

[18:11] <perlmonkey2> your idea bout it being short for a try/error block.

[18:12] <moritz> DarkWolf84: actually that could be solved by letting "err" check for defined/undef and not for true/false

[18:12] <DarkWolf84> i know

[18:36] <moritz> geoffb: if the scrolling speed is limited by your bandwith, you need an overflow channel ;-)

[18:37] <moritz> geoffb: when so many people write in a channel that your internet connection is not fast enough, then you need to split it up ;-)
