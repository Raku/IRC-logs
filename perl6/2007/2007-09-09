[12:44] <Juerd> Who does currently maintain evalbot?

[12:44] <Juerd> (if anyone...)

[12:45] <moritz_> diakopter++ does iirc

[12:46] <moritz_> according to SLAVES

[12:54] <Juerd> I've never heard about SLAVES

[12:54] <Juerd> Sounds like a particularly useful file :)

[12:55] <moritz_> it's in the pugs root dir ;)

[12:59] <Juerd> 2007-09-09

[12:59] <Juerd> Two new virtual machines were created: feather2 and feather3. Please move

[12:59] <Juerd> important services (like SVN) to feather2, and public eval services (like

[12:59] <Juerd> evalbot, runpugs) to feather3. Ask Juerd for an account and/or root access.

[13:00] *** barney left
[13:01] * moritz_ wants root access

[13:01] <moritz_> no, just kidding ;)

[13:02] <DarkWolf84> where is that GLOBAL::Test is that someting from CPAN?

[13:03] <moritz_> it's in v6/v6-KindaPerl6/lib-modules/

[13:04] <DarkWolf84> strange

[13:04] <moritz_> why?

[13:04] <DarkWolf84> it gives me that it could not be found

[13:04] <moritz_> did you do an svn up?

[13:05] <DarkWolf84> only for kp6 branch

[13:05] <Juerd> moritz_: Sure - on which machine and why?

[13:06] <Juerd> Don't be afraid to ask for something if you think it can help you develop Perl 6 better

[13:07] <DarkWolf84> ok I make full update now

[13:07] <moritz_> Juerd: I have a server myself where I have root access

[13:07] <moritz_> timtwotdi.org ;-)

[13:07] <Juerd> There is more than w...?

[13:08] <moritz_> oh, type

[13:10] <DarkWolf84> Can't locate GLOBAL/Test.pm in @INC

[13:10] <DarkWolf84> the same error

[13:12] <moritz_> what command are you running?

[13:12] <moritz_> 'perl run_tests_kp6_mp6.pl' should work

[13:13] <DarkWolf84> ok

[13:13] <DarkWolf84> I make 'make test'

[13:14] <moritz_> I think that tests kp6-kp6 by default

[13:14] <moritz_> which is not yet ready

[13:14] <DarkWolf84> ok

[13:15] <DarkWolf84> it tests mp6-kp6 and kp6-kp6

[13:17] <DarkWolf84> no

[13:17] <DarkWolf84> only the bootstraped one

[15:30] <moritz_> and @array.last would correspend to $#array

[15:34] <masak`> but @array.last isn't an lvalue, is it?

[15:35] *** rindolf joined
[15:37] <moritz_> I don't think so

[15:37] <moritz_> but you can predeclare the size of an array in p6

[15:43] *** masak left
[15:46] * moritz_ never used $#something as an lvalue

[15:59] *** iblechbot joined
[16:01] <ferreira> moritz_: did you mean @array.elems ?

[16:02] <moritz_> no, @array.end

[16:02] <moritz_> I always confuse 'last' and 'end' ;)

[16:11] <moritz_> #pugs <foo bar baz>.end

[16:11] <moritz_> pugs: <foo bar baz>.end

[17:33] <ferreira> moritz: probably the Perl 5 " $#a = new_last_index " should be equivalent to " @array.=end( new_last_index ) "

[17:37] <TimToady> most likely roles that support preextending should support a .preextend method or some such, and .end should stay readonly.

[17:38] <TimToady> but many array implementations will probably not support it

[17:39] <TimToady> afk &

[17:41] <ferreira> Which .=method variants are implemented in pugs? I mean in primitive types/classes

[17:42] <ferreira> Hey, " $string.=chop " works.
