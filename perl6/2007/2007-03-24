[00:03] <Limbic_Region> allbery_b - well, except that the message it gave me was one I had already seen over a week ago

[00:03] <Limbic_Region> allbery_b - so unless it also had a db restored, it is messed up

[00:04] <allbery_b> db restoration is not impossible, dons runs this LB from the dbs in darcs

[00:04] <allbery_b> so if for some reason he reverted something, the state accumulated since then would also disappear unless he was very careful

[00:06] <allbery_b> you could always @ask him about it...

[00:06] <Limbic_Region> I could - but I don't really care

[00:07] <Limbic_Region> I saw what gaal had to say in the irc log

[00:07] <Limbic_Region> others may be more affected though

[00:22] <geoffb> make is doing a complete rebuild -- did the pads branch land while I wasn't looking?

[00:23] <TimToady> no, but Makefile.PL was touched a day or so ago

[00:23] <geoffb> ... causing everything to seem out of date, gotcha

[00:28] <gaal> Limbic_Region: I'd left it to Limbic~Region by accident. She's not to blame, lambdabot.

[00:29] <ayrnieu> Hah, so I guessed.

[00:29] <Limbic_Region> oh

[01:27] <allbery_b> more accurate?

[01:27] * allbery_b should let someone who knows do the updating :>

[20:57] <lichtkind> TimToady i recently polished audreys wikipedia article is there anything you want to have noticed in your :)

[21:00] *** penk joined
[21:00] <lichtkind> TimToady: sorry man but i currently doint have the nerve for this kind of fun since i got today very angry in an unfair deletion debate where some scientism-fanatics wanted to delete an exelent work because they wantet it their way and thought rebuild from scratch would be faster 

[21:02] <lichtkind> but if there is something i can to just say http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall

[21:03] <TimToady> kay, thanks.

[21:04] <lichtkind> TimToady: by the way is it true that you where employed by Unisys while gave birth to perl?

[21:04] *** mdiep joined
[21:05] <TimToady> yes

[21:06] <lichtkind> ah thanks

[21:07] <lichtkind> and when exactly began perl to evolve? in http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl i wrote around march 1987

[21:07] <lambdabot> Title: Perl - Wikipedia

[21:07] <lichtkind> based on data from an larry wall interview :)

[21:08] <TimToady> that sounds about right. version 1 was released in late 1987.

[21:09] <lichtkind> yes these facts are well documented i just ask you what nowhere stands written, when the idea began

[21:11] <lichtkind> TimToady: it sounds to me you dunno exactly

[21:12] <TimToady> I don't know exactly.  I know the actual implementation was about a month old when Geneva was born May 12.

[21:13] <TimToady> but the disk drive containing the original info was long ago melted down by the U.S government...

[21:13] <TimToady> and I don't down it was melted down, given it was for a secret project.

[21:13] <lichtkind> ah the supersecret blacker

[21:13] <TimToady> wasn't really supersecret, just secret.

[21:14] <TimToady> but secret enough..

[21:14] <lichtkind> haha 

[21:14] * geoffb boggles that TimToady has security clearance  ;-)

[21:14] <lichtkind> me too :)

[21:14] <lichtkind> but its cool

[21:14] <TimToady> would be a lot harder for me to get now that I've been in X different countries...

[21:14] <obra> lichtkind: no. jesse on perlmonks

[21:15] <lichtkind> TimToady: yeah but it sounds to me totally unreasonably to make such an effort by an company line unisys

[21:15] <TimToady> if it had been the company's business I'd never have been allowed to release it as open source.

[21:15] <lichtkind> obra thanks so i assume kudra is here also kudra

[21:15] <TimToady> and I couldn't really even ask permission, since open source really had not been invented yet.

[21:17] <lichtkind> TimToady: of course but my point is that that this effort was no way an backbone of NSA activities just an experiment or something like that

[21:18] <TimToady> and in fact NSA abandoned blacker; last I heard only Canada was till using it, and even that is old info.

[21:19] <lichtkind> TimToady: my freind made some very funny jokes out of that in the camelopedia, a satiric version of wikipedia, too bad you cant german

[21:19] <TimToady> anyway, haven't had a clearance since I left Unisys.
