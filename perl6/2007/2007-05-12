[00:07] <Juerd> obra: Yes.

[00:07] <Juerd> obra: qpsmtpd and XML::SAX things broke

[00:07] <Juerd> Of course, both Perl related. For some reason, on feather, Perl things tend to break during upgrades. I wonder why :)

[00:08] <moritz> because a lot of perl stuff is installed

[00:08] <moritz> very much more than on my maschine I suppose

[00:09] <Khisanth> what is the size of your autobundle file? :)

[00:09] <moritz> dpkg -l 'lib*-perl'|grep ^ii|wc -l

[00:09] <moritz> 250

[00:09] <Juerd> moritz: Yeah, everything Debian had, minus everything that broke during upgrades :)

[00:09] <moritz> Khisanth: I pack (nearly) everything in debian packes that I install

[00:09] <Juerd>  dpkg -l 'lib*-perl'|grep ^ii|wc -l

[00:10] <Juerd> hm

[00:10] <Juerd> 1;0 root@feather:~#  dpkg -l 'lib*-perl'|grep ^ii|wc -l

[00:10] <Juerd> 829

[00:10] <moritz> if you'd install 800 graphic packages, some would break as well ;)

[00:11] <Khisanth> I seem to approximately 1/3 of what is on CPAN installed

[00:11] <Khisanth> to have

[00:12] <moritz> and do you use it?

[00:13] <Khisanth> only some :)

[00:14] <Khisanth> SVK, Catalyst and Jifty are probably responsible for dragging in half of those!

[00:15] <moritz> yes, they have huge dependencies

[00:15] <moritz> I only use catalyst of these three, but it's bad enough ;)

[00:16] <Khisanth> it doesn't really matter, I have the space :)

[00:16] <Khisanth> I tend to install things that looks interesting to play around with them anyway

[00:17] <moritz> and I tend to run debfoster now and then ;)

[00:18] <Khisanth> oh this is all in a copy of perl installed in ~ so it can't really break anything

[00:18] <Juerd> It can at least break itself.

[00:18] <wolverian> modern apt-get can do what debfoster does

[00:18] <Juerd> What is debfoster?

[00:19] <wolverian> maintains a list of apps vs automatically installed deps

[00:19] <moritz> interactively, if you want it

[00:19] <Juerd> Oh, that.

[00:19] <Juerd> On feather, I explicitly apt-get installed all perl modules I could find

[00:19] <wolverian> heh.

[00:19] <Juerd> Then tried again, after removing some clashing modules

[00:20] <Juerd> And bit by bit I'm removing modules from feather because they don't upgrade cleanly

[00:20] <Juerd> Like XML::SAX now.

[01:17] <Tene> that's why.

[01:17] <polettix> my perl6-fu is too weak to understand :/

[01:18] <Juerd> polettix: The output is already a Perlish string

[01:18] <Juerd> polettix: \\\" is the result of double-quotemeta'ing a single ".

[01:19] <polettix> Juerd: ok, so we're dealing with \"a", but why the backslash in front of the string?

[01:20] <Tene> polettix: because the output needs to contain \ and "

[01:20] <Tene> so the actual string has "\\" for the \ and '\"' for the "

[01:20] <Juerd> 03:20 < Juerd> polettix: \\\" is the result of double-quotemeta'ing a single ".

[01:20] <Juerd> While true, that was irrelevant here :)

[01:21] * Juerd now also wonders: why a capture?

[01:21] <polettix> Tene: what I don't get is why that \ has to be there.

[05:25] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[05:57] <agentzh> Juerd: can i create new accounts on feather?

[06:01] <svnbot6> r16243 | agentz++ | removed util/timeout.pl since we already have ulimit++

[06:03] <Aankhen``> agentzh: Yeah, maybe.

[06:10] <svnbot6> r16244 | agentz++ | smartlinks.pl - running util/t/*-smartlinks.t is sufficient.

[06:12] <agentzh> storing regression data on feather makes updating a bit inconvenience but it does save a lot of room in the pugs tree :)

[06:12] <agentzh> *inconvenient

[06:16] <Aankhen``> Oh, definitely.

[06:31] <agentzh> Aankhen``: you've added support for line-based anchors?

[06:31] <agentzh> (just guessing)

[06:34] <Aankhen``> Nah.

[06:34] <Aankhen``> I cleaned up the JavaScript portion.

[06:34] <agentzh> cool

[06:34] <Aankhen``> Yeh, it's the coolest thing ever. ;-)

[06:35] <agentzh> the old js snippets were stolen from the google's pages. ;)

[06:35] <Aankhen``> I figured as much when I saw the "is_ie" and "agt" and all that, LOL.

[06:35] <agentzh> *blush*

[06:35] <Aankhen``> No sweat.

[06:35] <Aankhen``> smartlinks.pl is très cool.

[06:36] <agentzh> thanks! although it's a bit hacky ;)

[06:36] <agentzh> i'd modulize it at some point.

[06:36] <Aankhen``> Well, perhaps, but hey, it's better than nothing.

[06:37] <agentzh> to tell the truth, i didn't expect the source to be that huge but it has been bloating very quickly :)

[06:37] <Aankhen``> It happens. ^_^

[06:38] <agentzh> people are requesting features and i'm adding them without much planning :)

[06:38] <Aankhen``> I'm all in favour of organic growth.

[06:38] <Aankhen``> With regular refactoring, of course. =)

[06:39] <agentzh> *nod* regular refactoring is a very good thing.

[06:39] <Aankhen``> As long as you have the time for it.

[06:39] <agentzh> time is always a problem. ;)

[06:39] <Aankhen``> Yup.

[06:44] <agentzh> now that we have a good test suite for smartlinks.pl, it's now quite easy to do any kind of refactoring. :)

[06:56] <buu> Aankhen``: !

[06:56] <buu> Aankhen``: Where is my jseval!

[07:02] <agentzh> Aankhen``: also, do s/Show the snippet from/Show/g for smartlinks.pl before you build the new tarball.

[07:03] <agentzh> such modifications change the resulting HTML as well. sigh.

[07:04] * agentzh wants the links to be less verbose.

[07:12] <Aankhen``> buu: I already told you, I don't know how to write it.

[07:12] <Aankhen``> agentzh: Ah, well, I'll leave the tarballs till I've checked in all the changes and discussed them with you.

[07:12] <agentzh> Aankhen``: okay :)

[07:14] <Aankhen``> Ugh, Trac was disabled.

[07:14] <agentzh> *nod*

[07:14] <Aankhen``> I need a diff between r16243 and r16244.

[07:14] <Aankhen``> Don't want to clobber your changes.

[07:15] <agentzh> well, i just modified a comment

[07:15] <Aankhen``> Oh, okay.

[07:15] <Aankhen``> So it doesn't matter if it's clobbered by mistake? :-)

[07:16] <agentzh> go for it!

[07:26] <svnbot6> r16245 | Aankhen++ | * overhauled JavaScript completely to reduce markup cruft and enable use of code without JavaScript enabled.

[07:26] <svnbot6> r16245 | Aankhen++ | * removed inline CSS and JS from all generated snippets.

[07:27] <Aankhen``> Oh, poop.  I think I lost the "X correct, Y failed" in the snippet line.

[07:27] <agentzh> ah, it's not covered by the test suite. alas

[07:28] <Aankhen``> Anyway, I'll just fix it, give me a few minutes.

[07:28] <agentzh> Aankhen``: feel free to fix the test suite too if you have the tuits :)

[07:29] * agentzh needs a trac.

[07:29] <Aankhen``> I shall, but in the mean time, do you have the tuits to just give it a once over and see if everything else looks okay to you?

[07:29] <Aankhen``> A second pair of eyes and all that.

[07:30] * agentzh is looking.

[07:32] <buu> Aankhen``: Dude, my daemons are working.

[07:32] <buu> !

[07:34] <Aankhen``> buu: Awesome!

[07:34] <buu> And I really need ops on #perl

[07:36] * Aankhen`` sighs.

[07:36] <Aankhen``> Syncing development between Windows and Debian-under-VMWare is a pain in the neck.

[07:37] * agentzh knows the feeling.

[07:38] <agentzh> ubuntu and winXP-in-virtualbox in my case ;)

[07:38] <Aankhen``> Hehe.

[07:38] <Aankhen``> At least Ubuntu is dominant there.

[07:39] <agentzh> indeed

[07:42] <Aankhen``> Well, it didn't, when I tried yesterday.

[07:42] <Aankhen``> I don't quite remember what the problem was.

[07:42] <Aankhen``> Let me finish syncing up the two and I'll try it again.

[07:42] <agentzh> IE issues?

[07:42] <agentzh> or you mean .pl itself?

[07:42] <Aankhen``> The .pl itself.

[07:43] <Aankhen``> What I'm really itching to do is refactor all the POD to HTML translators out there, but I figure I'll just write a Perl6::Perldoc::To::Html instead. ^_^

[07:43] <agentzh> .pl runs fine on my winXP.

[07:43] <Aankhen``> Hmm, okay, I'll take a look at it again.

[07:44] <Tene> Aankhen``: explain "refactor all the translators out there"?

[07:44] <Aankhen``> Tene: Basically, make them generate better HTML.

[07:44] <Aankhen``> ...yes, I realize how vague that is.

[07:44] <Aankhen``> Let me see if I can find an example for you.

[07:45] * agentzh thinks smartlinks.pl uses Pod::Simple::Html to do the translation except for S26.

[07:45] <Aankhen``> agentzh: It does, I checked. :-P

[07:46] <agentzh> k

[07:47] <agentzh> Aankhen``: the generated HTML looks terrible in IE.

[07:48] <Aankhen``> Well, I look at the output from pod2html, and the things that come to mind immediately are: drop all the `name` attributes in favour of IDs, make it HTML 4.01 Strict instead of XHTML 1.0 Strict.

[07:48] <Aankhen``> agentzh: Yeh, doesn't look all that great in Firefox either, really.

[07:49] <agentzh> Firefox doesn't work either :-/

[07:51] <agentzh> Aankhen``: please revert the commits until you find a real solution or http://perlcabal.org/syn will break.

[08:59] <Aankhen``> agentzh: Remember to test the actual output, not the stuff under got/.

[08:59] <agentzh> Aankhen``: sure

[08:59] <Aankhen``> Which I'm still wondering about... hmm.

[08:59] <Aankhen``> s/\s+$//gms;

[08:59] <Aankhen``> That would be the problem.

[08:59] <agentzh> *nod*

[08:59] <Aankhen``> (From 01-smartlinks.t:111)

[08:59] <agentzh> i gathered so.

[08:59] <Aankhen``> Sorry, I'm a little slower!

[09:00] <agentzh> :)

[09:05] <Aankhen``> Does everything look alright?

[09:06] <agentzh> still looking

[09:06] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[09:07] <agentzh> Aankhen``: have you tested the HTML output with IE?

[09:07] <Aankhen``> Aye.

[09:07] <agentzh> k

[09:08] * agentzh is on a slow machine.

[09:09] <Aankhen``> Oh, hang on, just found something else on IE.  Need to investigate.

[09:09] <agentzh> Aankhen``: when there's no smoke results given, smartlinks.pl should not complain "No test results for ..."

[09:09] <Aankhen``> Oh, that's just the active content blocking thing.

[09:09] <Aankhen``> Nevermind.

[09:09] <Aankhen``> agentzh: Alright.

[09:10] <Aankhen``> Ugh, that nice radical sign looks really ugly in IE. :-\

[09:11] <Aankhen``> I think I've got my font size set too low.

[09:12] <svnbot6> r16248 | Aankhen++ | util/smartlinks.new.pl:

[09:12] <svnbot6> r16248 | Aankhen++ | * removed "No test results for?\226?\128?\166" warning.

[09:12] <agentzh> it looks good in firefox.

[09:12] <Aankhen``> :-D

[09:13] <Aankhen``> D'oh.  The ending " -" pushed itself after the colon.

[09:13] <Aankhen``> Easily fixed though.

[09:13] <agentzh> so is in IE.

[09:14] <Aankhen``> Yay.

[09:14] <Aankhen``> There isn't all that much difference (as far as I can tell), since most of the work was under the hood.

[09:14] <polettix> eval? "Val = { $a.ord.fmt('%x') }\n"

[09:14] <agentzh> cool, r16248 looks nice.

[09:15] <Aankhen``> Of course, if you have JS disabled, then you see a rather large difference. :-)

[09:16] <agentzh> with JS disabled, all snippets expand by deault.

[09:17] <Aankhen``> Yup.

[09:17] <Aankhen``> In smartlinks.pl, all snippets are hidden by default, so if you have JS disabled, the links don't work and you can never see them.

[09:18] *** tewk_ joined
[09:18] <agentzh> *nod* but it was also intentional.

[09:18] <agentzh> because snippets are normally "big"

[09:19] <Aankhen``> But then you can't see them at all. :-S

[09:19] <agentzh> right

[09:19] <svnbot6> r16249 | Aankhen++ | util/smartlinks.new.pl:

[09:19] <svnbot6> r16249 | Aankhen++ | * fixed " -" being placed after ":".

[09:19] <Aankhen``> What I could do, if the intent was to skip those blocks, is to add skip links.

[09:19] <agentzh> well, it's just a personal taste. feel free to do it the way you like ;)

[09:20] <agentzh> it doesn't matter at all :)

[09:20] <Aankhen``> Ah, I'm just trying not to step on anybody's toes, and living in fear of breaking perlcabal.org. ;-)

[09:21] <agentzh> Aankhen``: breaking it temporarily is acceptable :)

[09:21] <agentzh> (for development reasons)

[09:21] <agentzh> since it's easier to test and easier to get feedback.

[09:21] <Aankhen``> True.

[09:21] <agentzh> no fear please

[09:22] <Aankhen``> Alright.

[09:22] <agentzh> it's fine to "mv smartlinks.new.pl smartlinks.pl" now :)

[09:22] <Aankhen``> Kewl.

[09:23] <agentzh> if there's a problem, i'll receive something from feather's cron and cry out. :)

[09:23] * agentzh won't be too conservative.

[09:24] <agentzh> Aankhen``: sorry if i have give you such an impression :)

[09:24] <agentzh> *given

[09:25] <Aankhen``> Well, it was basically the notice at the top of smartlinks.pl, and it seemed reasonable to me.

[09:25] <agentzh> :)

[09:25] <svnbot6> r16250 | Aankhen++ | * moved util/smartlinks.new.pl over util/smartlinks.pl

[09:26] <Aankhen``> But it's good to know that temporary breakage won't get me yelled at. =)

[09:26] <agentzh> heh

[09:26] <polettix> what's the name of the script to send results to the smoke server?

[09:27] <agentzh> polettix: under util/

[09:27] <polettix> agentzh: yes, but I don't remember the name, probably util/smokeserv/smokeserv-client.pl

[09:27] <svnbot6> r16251 | Aankhen++ | util/smartlinks.pl:

[09:34] <polettix> there is a bug in the interaction of fmt() with interpolation in double-quotish environments. Should the test be added to t/builtins/fmt.t or to t/syntax/interpolation/strings.t, or on a test file by its own?

[09:34] <Aankhen``> t/syntax/interpolation/fmt.t?

[09:35] <Aankhen``> (Just a suggestion.)

[09:35] <polettix> option 3 seems reasonable :)

[09:41] *** tewk_ joined
[09:41] *** larsen_ joined
[09:43] <moritz> I don't think an own test file is a good idea, because it fragments the test suite

[09:45] *** the_dormant joined
[09:45] <polettix> moritz: it exercises a but that's specific to fmt and interpolation. What comes first (ideally), syntax or builtins? If we don't want an ad-hoc test, it should probably go to the one that "comes last"

[09:46] <polettix> s/but/bug/

[09:46] <moritz> then I'd vote for the builtin

[09:47] <polettix> ok, I'll add the tests there, as long as I manage to make them work (it seems that it dies or something like this...)

[09:47] <moritz> even with eval()?

[09:47] <polettix> yes, as long as I used it correctly

[09:48] <polettix> ?eval my $x = 'A'; $x.say

[09:48] *** evalbot_r16241 is now known as evalbot_r16247

[09:48] <evalbot_r16247> OUTPUT[A␤] Bool::True

[09:48] <polettix> ?eval my $x = 'A'; "$x".say

[09:48] <evalbot_r16247> OUTPUT[A␤] Bool::True

[09:48] <polettix> ?eval my $x = 'A'; "$x.ord.fmt('%x')".say;

[09:49] <polettix> ?eval my $x = 'A'; "this is $x.ord.fmt('%x')".say;

[09:49] <evalbot_r16247> "41"

[09:49] <agentzh> polettix: it seems okay

[09:49] <polettix> it lacks "this is"

[09:49] <agentzh> polettix: oh?

[09:50] <polettix> ?eval my $x = 'A'; ("this is " ~ "$x.ord.fmt('%x')").say;

[09:50] <evalbot_r16247> "41"

[09:52] *** tewk joined
[09:53] <polettix> should this trap errors?   my $y = eval( "something $x.ord.fmt('%x')" );

[09:54] <agentzh> why not eval_ok?

[09:54] * agentzh prefers eval_ok since it provides better diagnostics.

[09:55] <agentzh> eval_ok is good for "testing the tests".

[09:55] <polettix> no way, it exits and does not continue with other tests. OTOH, it prints the   # Looks like you planned 6 tests, but ran 2   line

[09:56] <polettix> eval_ok( "something $x.ord.fmt('%x')", 'interpolation and fmt live' );

[09:56] <polettix> am I missing something obvious in eval_ok() syntax?

[09:56] <agentzh> polettix: you've made a mistake there.

[09:56] <polettix> d'oh

[09:57] <polettix> maybe I should add curlies?

[09:57] <agentzh> you can only eval p6 code.

[09:57] <agentzh> is "something ..." just a place-holder?

[09:58] <polettix> it's just some text inside the string to exercise the test, but I should probably embed the string inside something else

[10:00] <agentzh> eval_ok(q{"something $x.ord.fmt('%x')".say});

[10:01] *** tewk_ joined
[10:01] *** Belaf joined
[10:01] <polettix> do I have to 'use' something more than Test?

[10:02] <agentzh> no, you shouldn't.

[10:02] <agentzh> eval_ok is no longer available?

[10:02] * agentzh has not written any p6 tests since last summer.

[10:03] <polettix> it does not complain not finding it, so it should be there

[10:03] <agentzh> or try { is "something $x.ord.fmt('%x')", "something 41"; }

[10:03] *** chris2 joined
[10:04] <agentzh> not sure if the try block works for you.

[10:05] <polettix> try works, at least it makes the test go on

[10:05] <agentzh> cool

[10:05] <polettix> is there something like lives_ok in Test::Exception?

[10:07] <agentzh> eval_ok *should* behave like lives_ok, i _think_

[10:08] *** tewk joined
[10:08] <polettix> there's a thing I don't understand... I'm invoking my test file with  ./pugs t/.../fmt.t

[10:08] <agentzh> polettix: use util/prove6 instead of ./pugs

[10:08] <polettix> but I see that the imported Test.pm comes from my perl 5 library. Is this correct?

[10:09] <moritz> I dont't think so

[10:09] <moritz> what's the value of your PERL6LIB env variable?

[10:09] <polettix> ah, prove6 is the answer!

[10:09] <polettix> sorry for your wasted time

[10:10] <agentzh> actually prove6 set the env for you.

[10:13] <agentzh> they were my favorites.

[10:13] <polettix> there is lives_ok anyway

[10:17] <moritz> "direct string interpolation" and "string interpolation via braces"?

[10:17] <polettix> ok, sorry. I didn't know if there were "technical definitions" for the two

[10:18] <moritz> btw is "{$x}" automatically "{~$x}" ?

[10:18] <svnbot6> r16253 | agentz++ | 01-smartlinks.t - fixed the newline problem (Aankhen++)

[10:18] <polettix> moritz: it seems reasonable anyway, if any guru in this field finds these description horrible... s?he will change it :D

[10:19] <moritz> right ;)

[10:19] <agentzh> scalar interpolation and code interpolation?

[10:19] <moritz> sounds even better ;)

[10:19] <moritz> guru-agentzh ;)

[10:19] <agentzh> :)

[10:21] <polettix> this *is* weird. lives_ok says that the interpolation lives, but when I call it "directly" it makes the test bail out.

[10:29] <moritz> I don't think it should make a difference, but it's worth trying

[10:30] <polettix> same result, it says that it lives

[10:30] * agentzh does not like the signature of lives_ok.

[10:30] <agentzh> a string arg is more useful since there maybe a syntax error in the code which can't even be parsed.

[10:32] <agentzh> polettix: use "ok eval('...')" for now :)

[10:33] <agentzh> ...or something like that

[10:41] <moritz> if it fails, $! or $@ is set I think

[10:43] <polettix> no, it seems that $@ is gone
