[15:43] <fglock> it's a multi token

[15:43] <dlocaus> ok, I've made that change on my own code, but it breaks

[15:43] <dlocaus> on the empty braces { }

[15:43] <dlocaus> if I put a "1;" in there it works, well it parses at least.

[15:44] <fglock> how about { '' }

[15:44] <dlocaus> I've checked the grammar for proto, but it says that it should be <.ws>

[15:46] <dlocaus> or finding out how it broke?

[15:46] *** zamolxes left
[15:47] <fglock> reverting to past versions works, but it is very tedious

[16:29] <pugs_svn> r18803 | pmurias++ | [kp6] commented out COMPILER::begin_block() in proto - it might be better to solve the runtime issues before the compile time

[16:30] <pmurias> dlocaus: MultiToken should be only used for 'proto token {}'

[16:31] <dlocaus> Yes.

[16:31] <dlocaus> Isn't that what I did?

[16:32] <dlocaus> I've traced the compilation problem to compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Pad.pm:    my $source = $data->{_dispatch}( $data, 'perl' )->{_value};

[16:32] <dlocaus> $source returns { ... } instead of "{ }"

[16:33] <pmurias> begin_block compiles and runs the ast at compile time

[16:34] <pmurias> is ... a compile error in kp6?

[16:35] <dlocaus> I think so

[16:36] *** Silence joined
[16:36] <pmurias> you can fix it ;)

[16:36] *** IllvilJa left
[16:36] <dlocaus> the  compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Grammar/Sub.pm file code expects "{}" not "{ ... }" as produced by compiled/.../Pad.pm

[16:36] <pmurias> Multi.perl would have to serialise it correctly

[16:37] <pmurias> itself

[16:37] <pmurias> commenting begin_block out is the best option untill it does

[16:38] <dlocaus> pmurias: I'm sorry, I don't get what you are saying?

[16:39] <fglock> buggy code is easy to find - commenting out code creates hard to find bugs

[16:43] <dlocaus> ::Code->perl() returns  "{ ... }", but the grammar spec requires "'{' <.opt_ws> '}'".

[16:43] <fglock> it's not a bug - it's a TODO

[16:44] <pmurias> dlocaus: the bug in Multi.pm

[16:44] <pmurias> kp6 should handle ...

[16:46] * dlocaus looks lost

[16:46] <pmurias> dlocaus: sorry the ofenting .perl is in MOP

[16:46] <pmurias> dlocaus: "..." is valid perl6

[16:46] <pmurias> pugs: ...

[16:46] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** Cannot use this control structure outside a 'routine' structure␤    at /tmp/fEyKiVbDzw line 1, column 1 - line 2, column 1␤]

[16:46] <pmurias> pugs: sub a {...}; a()

[16:46] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** Unimplemented stub called␤    at /tmp/JFGbraT6h4 line 1, column 23-27␤       /tmp/JFGbraT6h4 line 1, column 17-20␤]

[16:47] <dlocaus> I thought "..." was valid perl6 for "Unknown, code that will be replaced later"

[16:47] *** Timm3h left
[16:47] <dlocaus> the perl6 grammar spec, called for optional white space.

[16:47] *** Notrix joined
[16:48] <pmurias> dlocaus: yes

[16:49] <pugs_svn> r18804 | pmurias++ | [kp6] uncommented the line fglock requested, Multi and MultiToken exist at compile time but are empty

[16:49] <pmurias> the syntax error happened in begin_block()

[16:49] <dlocaus> so, "<.opt_ws>" should also handle "..."

[16:49] <pmurias> dlocaus: no

[16:50] *** jjore-w joined
[16:50] <pmurias> the grammar used by kp6 isn't the offical perl6 grammar

[16:50] <dlocaus> The only other option is to replace the '{' <.opt_ws> '}' with '{' <.opt_ws_or_code> '}'

[16:50] <pmurias> that's STD

[16:50] <pmurias> it wouldn't help at all

[16:51] <pmurias> dlocaus: you mean in token proto

[16:51] <dlocaus> pmurias: yes.

[16:51] <pmurias> dlocaus: token proto parses ok

[16:51] <dlocaus> no.

[16:51] <pmurias> it calls begin_block($ast)

[16:52] <pmurias> dlocaus: yes

[16:52] <dlocaus> That is what started me on this.

[16:52] <pmurias> the ast is then executed

[16:52] *** IllvilJa joined
[16:53] <pmurias> the side effects are serilised as perl6 and turned into ast

[16:53] <pmurias> the were serilised by calling .perl which returned invalid perl6 code

[16:54] <pmurias> fglock: please check if i'm correct

[16:54] <pugs_svn> r18805 | fglock++ | [kp6] a simple impl of '...'

[16:54] <dlocaus> humm, that didn't invoke the bug

[16:55] <pmurias> dlocaus: i fixed it and it disapeared

[16:56] <pmurias> the result of begin_block is then ignored as far as i know

[16:58] <fglock> t/kp6/56-token-sym.t now gives "UndefinedHashItem" messages, which is the thing I'm working now

[16:58] <dlocaus> running tests.

[16:59] <dlocaus>  :)

[17:00] <dlocaus> t/kp6/36-multi.t breaks

[17:00] <dlocaus>     proto my_multi {};

[17:00] <dlocaus>     &my_multi.long_names = [

[17:03] <dlocaus> Well, in some manner or anther, I've caused 56-token-sym.t to be closed out :)

[17:03] <dlocaus> On my plate I have the following>

[17:03] <Tene> kp6: ...

[17:03] *** exp_evalbot left
[17:03] <dlocaus> 1. Get the AST to do the following perl6 -> kp6 -> perl6

[17:03] <dlocaus> 2. Write documentation to explain the big picture of kp6.

[17:03] <pmurias> Tene: you scared of exp_evalbot

[17:04] <Tene> I did.

[17:04] <pmurias> ;)

[17:09] <pmurias> dlocaus: Multi should be used for proto my_multi {}

[17:09] <fglock> Tene: say 123

[17:10] <Tene> ENOACCESS

[17:10] <fglock> hmm - a bug

[17:14] <dlocaus> pmurias: but fglock said MultiToken should be used for proto namespace {}

[17:15] <dlocaus> well, not proto namespace, but for proto..

[17:16] <pmurias> only for proto token my_multitoken {}

[17:17] <dlocaus> pmurias: oh hurm..

[17:17] <dlocaus> oh hurmm.. I have to vote today... :).. Ducks pmurias... I'll be back in a while :)

[17:33] <dlocaus> Humm, a programmer commenting on physics being psychics, when at the ever increasing complexity of our computer systems, we actually claim to know what's going on in our computer.

[17:33] <dlocaus>  ;)

[17:33] <avar> fglock: !!! is die

[17:34] <fglock> avar: fix it !!!

[17:34] <avar> !!!

[17:34] <avar> what should ... use as a noop?

[17:34] <dlocaus> brb, gotta vote now.

[17:34] <fglock> is it a noop?

[17:35] <avar> I think so, not sure though

[17:35] <avar> !!! = die, ??? = warn, ... = noop iirc

[17:35] <moritz_> .oO( is voting a noop? )

[17:36] *** jjore-w left
[17:36] <fglock> '...' is a noop in google

[17:36] <moritz_> sub foo { ... } is a prototype

[19:42] <dlocaus> moritz_: all perl6 files beginning with "use v6-alpha;"  have to be compiled with mp6 right?

[19:42] <moritz_> dlocaus: no

[19:43] <moritz_> dlocaus: it's just a flag that says it's not perl 5

[19:43] <dlocaus> ok

[19:43] *** jisom joined
[19:44] <moritz_> because a perl 6 compiler has to assume perl 5 syntax on any file it reads, unless it encounters a 'use v6;', a 'module ...' or a 'class ...' statement

[19:44] <dlocaus> wasn't that up for debate?

[19:45] <dlocaus> weather or not to allow the perl6 compiler to parse perl5?

[19:45] <moritz_> well, maybe. But the current specs says "perl5 until told otherwise"

[19:46] <dlocaus> and eval "$perl_code_here"?

[19:46] *** drupek12 joined
[19:46] <moritz_> if called in p6, it evals p6

[19:46] <moritz_> if called from p5, it evals p5

[19:47] <moritz_> if called from python... guess what ;)

[19:48] <dlocaus> I mean, if you eval " .. code .. " you have to have the compiler too to compile what ever is in that string.

[19:48] <dlocaus> if you only have the parrot interperter you cannot compile.

[19:48] <moritz_> of course

[19:48] <dlocaus> hurmm... ok

[19:48] <moritz_> that's why you have to compile the whole compiler into PIR if you want to distribute it separately

[19:48] * dlocaus thinks the parrot people really have their work cut out for them.
