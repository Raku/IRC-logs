[15:32] <TimToady> I slept longer than I thought...

[15:33] <obra> TimToady: good morning!

[15:33] <TimToady> blurg

[15:33] <obra> take your time, but whenever you feel like it, we'd love to drag you out to brunch

[15:34] <TimToady> I'm more or less ready

[15:35] <obra> ok. I think we'd be good to go in ~10 minutes or so. Anything in particular you feel like, foodwise? Easy options at this hour include, crepes, eggs, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, salads, burritos. 

[15:36] <diakopter> mmmmmm so hungry

[15:39] *** offby1 joined
[15:44] <TimToady> Let's see, I'm allergic to crepes, eggs, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches, and burritos.  That makes it easy.

[15:50] <Juerd> Ruby's array operator "-" is useful here. Does Perl 6 have something like it yet?

[15:51] <Juerd> ['crepes', 'eggs', 'waffles', 'pancakes', 'sandwitches', 'salads', 'burritos'] - ['crepes', 'eggs', 'waffles', 'pancakes', 'sandwiches', 'burritos'] results in ['salads']

[15:51] <integral> set difference, or some other form of difference?

[15:52] <Juerd> I'm not familiar with set jargon.

[15:52] <Juerd> Does difference include addition?

[15:52] <integral> I was just wondering if order is significant

[15:53] <Juerd> It's not

[15:53] <Juerd> Maybe @foo.without:LIST in Perl 6

[15:55] *** vel left
[15:55] <Juerd> @foo.=with:LIST would be the same as @foo.push:LIST :)

[15:55] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[15:55] <wolverian> Juerd, there are set operators already, I think.

[15:55] <Juerd> wolverian: Sets don't have duplicates, right?

[15:55] <wolverian> multisets do. normal sets don't.

[15:56] <Juerd> Blergh.

[15:56] <Juerd> I hate that I have to learn all this stuff to use Perl 6.

[15:56] <diakopter> well, to follow maths-english, it would be written ['crepes', 'eggs', 'waffles', 'pancakes', 'sandwitches', 'salads', 'burritos']['crepes', 'eggs', 'waffles', 'pancakes', 'sandwitches', 'salads', 'burritos'] or $a$b if $a and $b are Array objects

[15:57] <Juerd> wolverian: Is a multiset an array without order?

[15:57] <diakopter> er, faulty paste there in the second []

[15:57] <wolverian> Juerd, basically, yes. 

[15:58] <wolverian> Juerd, this probably falls under the underspecced libraries synopsis, though..

[15:58] <Juerd> wolverian: Is the lack of order ever needed or useful? (i.e. why not just use an array?)

[15:58] <wolverian> Juerd, equality.

[15:59] <Juerd> sort(@foo) ~~ sort(@bar)

[15:59] <Juerd> Insufficient?

[15:59] <wolverian> shrug. haskell doesn't have multisets either, I think.

[16:00] <Juerd> A whole new datatype, with new operators, new everything, seems a bit much if it's just for equality testing. I can't remember when I last needed to compare two hashes or two arrays or two lists.

[16:00] <wolverian> well, sets are pretty important, I think. multisets not so.

[16:00] <Juerd> I don't see the point of sets either, if we already have hashes.

[16:01] <Juerd> For all I care, we could have a kind of hash in which every value is forced to 1 :)

[16:01] *** BinGOs joined
[16:01] <Juerd> Until someone shows me why a set is more useful, of course :)

[16:01] <Juerd> I'm willing to learn stuff, if it's pragmatic and not just academically more correct.

[16:01] <wolverian> the keys of a hash are a set. sets are not more useful than hashes, they're a component of hashes.

[16:02] <wolverian> or a way to analyse them.

[16:02] * wolverian shrugs again

[16:02] <Juerd> wolverian: Does the Perl language need a datatype for sets, given hashes?

[16:02] <Juerd> Not talking about internals, now.

[16:02] <wolverian> perl5 didn't need 'em :)

[16:03] <wolverian> s/didn't/doesn't/

[16:03] <Juerd> Sets and set operators, to me, look like language bloat. It's something that could and should be done in a module IMO.

[16:03] <wolverian> I think that's the plan.

[16:03] <Juerd> That's a relief

[16:04] <wolverian> well, okay, 'Set' is mentioned in the built-in immutable types

[16:04] <wolverian> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Immutable_types

[16:04] <lambdabot> Title: S02

[16:10] <wolverian> yes, it's a more typeful approach than perl5

[16:10] <wolverian> hopefully it won't be too awkward.. we still have implicit coercions, afaik :)

[16:25] *** greentea joined

[16:34] <Gothmog_> A hashtable ist just a way to efficiently implement a set or multiset, with values in {0, 1} or {0, 1, 2, ...}, respectively. You may think of sets and multisets as special cases of a hashtable.

[16:36] <masak> Gothmog_: the 0 values are not necessary if you delete kv pairs instead of zeroing them out

[18:22] <TimToady> See S02:829 for p6's take on Sets and Bags and their relationship to hashes.  Pretty much exactly what you folks were reinventing here...

[18:24] * SamB wonders if that means it's a good idea or not

[18:27] <amnesiac> TimToady, Bags as Counted Sets?

[18:28] <TimToady> yes

[18:28] <amnesiac> ok.

[18:28] <TimToady> or Sets as Bags that can only count in Bool

[18:29] <amnesiac> right

[18:30] * TimToady wonders if people can't even read as far as S03, how are they ever going to get to S13...

[18:30] <TimToady> s/3/2

[18:31] * Juerd still has rereading synopses on his todo list.

[18:31] <amnesiac> TimToady, because.... of lack of REAL interest, or probably too "deep" for them.

[18:31] <integral> Tablet, capsule or syrup (or suppository for the continent) forms would be handy

[18:31] <TimToady> course, if people actually did read them and comment, we'd have to change 'em all again :)

[18:31] <Juerd> amnesiac: Or plain lack of tuits and concentration.

[18:32] <Juerd> And the threshold gets higher as Perl 6 gets more complex

[18:32] <amnesiac> concentration is part of interest, if you have no interest, reading them by "force" is having no concentration at all.

[18:32] <amnesiac> well at least, I can't concentrate if I'm reading something I don't want to.

[18:33] <integral> at somepoint "perl6doc Bag" "perl6doc Set" will be nice

[18:34] <amnesiac> Juerd, agreed, that's my point :P

[18:34] <Juerd> What exactly is your point? :)

[18:34] <Juerd> A question?

[18:34] <amnesiac> integral, thing is... a Bag and a Set are abstract concepts, or you mean how they will be implemented?

[18:34] *** pmurias joined
[18:34] <amnesiac> Juerd, oh my answer is TimToady's question about why people doesn't read above S02.

[18:35] <integral> amnesiac: I thought they were interfaces

[18:35] *** funktio left
[18:37] <amnesiac> integral, A Bag and a Set is a form of representation of a data collection, with some constraints.

[18:37] *** weinig joined
[18:37] <TimToady> need to distinguish values from containers

[18:40] <amnesiac> TimToady, as for the relation ship of values and Bag/Sets?

[18:40] <amnesiac> eerr, relationship of data collection and Bag/Sets?

[18:41] <TimToady> sets and bags are immutable values.  a KeySet can represent one set at a time, but when you change it, it's representing a different set

[18:43] *** dduncan joined
[18:45] <wolverian> yeah, I need to read more than just the names of the types sometime.. :)

[18:47] <wolverian> I like Blob..

[18:48] <wolverian> TimToady, do you have any interface sketches for the basic types? 

[18:48] <TimToady> no, that would be a good thing for someone to work on

[18:48] <amnesiac> sketches?

[18:49] <TimToady> there might be some of it in Prelude.pm, but I think it's mostly in Haskell

[18:49] <amnesiac> errr I mean, interface sketches? how's that?

[18:49] <TimToady> to the extent that there is anythin

[18:49] <TimToady> well, they'd be roles in p6

[18:49] <wolverian> yeah, I meant role interfaces.. :)
