[13:46] <smallfoot-> no

[13:46] <smallfoot-> i dont even know what a puge commit bit is lol

[13:46] <smallfoot-> perl6 is vaporware

[13:46] <[particle]> pugs is an implementation of perl 6

[13:46] <masak> smallfoot-: a pugs commit bit is access to the pugs repository

[13:46] <[particle]> so you're wrong

[13:47] <masak> yes, pugs runs fairly well for a piece of vaporware :)

[13:47] <masak> smallfoot-: have you downloaded and tried pugs?

[13:48] <[particle]> ?eval "hello from perl 6, smallfoot-".say;

[13:48] <smallfoot-> i thought parrot was perl6

[13:48] <masak> #pugs "hello from perl 6, smallfoot-"

[13:48] <exp_evalbot> No output

[13:48] <masak> hm

[13:48] <smallfoot-> lol

[13:48] <masak> smallfoot-: no, parrot will be able to run perl6

[13:48] <smallfoot-> no output! PWN'D!

[13:48] <masak> but parrot in itself is not perl6

[13:48] <smallfoot-> ok

[13:49] <masak> moritz_: what's up with exp_evalbot? :/

[13:49] <smallfoot-> can parrot run python?

[13:49] <masak> smallfoot-: I know it's been a project, at least

[15:25] <masak> thx

[15:25] * masak is used to removing .say calls when passing to evalbot

[15:25] <moritz_> unfortunately I haven't found a magical solution for that 

[15:25] <masak> moritz_: maybe just as well

[15:26] <masak> it's my experience that people like to use .say :)

[15:26] * moritz_ like the old evalbot behaviour

[16:00] <moritz_> hi obra ;)

[16:00] <sunnavy> hi, obra

[16:00] <masak> y0, obra 

[16:00] <moritz_> sunnavy++ # adding more unicode tests

[16:01] <sunnavy> so shy, added just two, still need more work, :-)

[16:03] <obra> how's perl6 hackery, folks?

[16:03] <moritz_> kp6 is moving quite a bit these days

[16:03] *** cognominal_ joined
[16:03] <[particle]> hey there, obra

[16:04] <moritz_> and nqp as well I've heard, but the nqp people mostly hang around int #parrot

[16:04] <moritz_> I guess [particle] could tell us more ;)

[16:04] <[particle]> yes, nqp is moving along

[16:04] *** rfordinal_mobile joined
[16:04] <[particle]> i'm a cross-platform perl6 hacker :)

[16:04] <moritz_> ;-)

[16:05] <moritz_> "I've never seen a cross-platform installation, but many programs now support that platform..."

[16:05] <[particle]> once nqp has working sdl bindings, i'm thinking of writing logo on parrot

[16:05] * obra is looking forward to the day when 6 on 6 can target both nqp and kp6

[16:06] <[particle]> i'm hoping we have two way pugs/parrot ast transformations someday

[16:06] * moritz_ thinks a PIR emitter for kp6 would be a great idea for a microgrant

[16:07] <[particle]> moritz_: i prefer transformation at the ast level. that's the logical separation from front-end and back-end

[16:08] <[particle]> so a PAST emitter for kp6

[16:08] *** rfordinal_mobile left
[16:08] <[particle]> then the generated past can use all of the parrot compiler toolchain's optimizations during compilation, without rewriting them

[16:10] <moritz_> so how would the PAST be passed from kp6 to parrot?

[16:11] <[particle]> the ability for parrot to accept past directly does not yet exist

[16:12] <[particle]> but should be easy to add

[16:12] *** rfordinal_mobile joined
[16:12] <[particle]> for the typical hll on parrot, the developer need only write the parser and past emitter

[16:12] <[particle]> parrot handles the rest

[16:12] <[particle]> ...of compilation and execution.

[16:13] <moritz_> well, perhaps a bit of high level optimization woudn't be bad ;)

[18:12] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Array::Const␤]

[18:12] <moritz_> it's weird but not impossible... a hash can be viewed as list of pairs

[18:13] <bloonix> but I dont use constants

[18:14] *** stevan_ joined
[18:14] <bloonix> hmmm

[18:15] <bloonix> I do: "has Hash $.foo;" and return foo in a method "return self.foo"

[18:15] <bloonix> maybe this is the reason for the constant

[18:17] <bloonix> yes thats the reason

[18:18] <bloonix> CpuStats.pm:has Hash $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> DiskStats.pm:has Hash $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> NetStats.pm:has Hash $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> PgSwStats.pm:has Hash $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> Processes.pm:has Hash  $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> ProcStats.pm:has Hash $.stats = {};

[18:18] <bloonix> and that all hashes where I get an Array::Const :/

[18:18] <bloonix> are

[18:19] <moritz_> #pugs constant %h; if %h ~~ Hash { say "hash" } else { say "not a hash" }

[18:19] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[not a hash␤]

[18:19] <moritz_> but _that_'s wrong

[18:20] *** ubajas3 left

[18:31] <bloonix> %Hash2<foo> is a Array::Const but %Hash1 not :/

[18:32] <bloonix> did I say that I'm confused? :)

[18:32] *** aben_ left
[18:33] <moritz_> why don't you use a "real" hash in the class?

[18:33] <moritz_> I'm confused as well ;)

[18:34] <bloonix> what do you mean? %stats := self.stats ?

[18:34] <bloonix> if I replace self.foo with %foo "return %foo" that it runs

[18:34] <bloonix> s/that/then/

[18:36] <moritz_> I mean class Foo { has %foo; }

[18:36] <bloonix> because I didnt know that this is possible :)

[18:37] <bloonix> moment

[18:37] <bloonix> how can I access the hash in a method?

[18:37] <bloonix> self.foo is right?

[18:45] <moritz_> right

[18:45] <bloonix>  No such method in class Foo: "&foo"

[18:51] <bloonix> moritz_: if I replace $.foo with %.foo then %Hash2<foo> is a Hash::Const, but if I do "my %foo := self.foo; return %foo" then its a Hash and not a Hash::Const

[18:52] <moritz_> bloonix: that's desired because %.foo has no 'is rw' trait, e.g. it returns a read-only reference/capture...

[18:52] <moritz_> whereas return %foo; returns a copy

[18:52] <moritz_> I think ;)

[18:53] <fridim> ergo sum

[18:54] <ajs> Shouldn't simply "class A is rw { has %x }" define a public, modifiable %x with appropriate accessors?

[18:55] <bloonix> hmmm

[18:55] <ajs> Then S12 should be updated
