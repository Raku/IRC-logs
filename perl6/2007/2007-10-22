[07:24] <agentzh> hmm, my svk pugs repos is broken again :/

[07:25] <agentzh> does anyone have some idea on what is going on here?

[07:29] <moritz_> svk bug is my guess :)

[07:30] *** dduncan left
[07:32] <agentzh> moritz_: heh

[07:32] <agentzh> haven't touched my pugs copy 2 or 3 months...

[07:33] <agentzh> today when i finally have the chance to get back to it...it breaks...

[07:33] <agentzh> sigh

[07:33] <moritz_> agentzh: use git and git-svn ;)

[07:34] <pmurias> or plain old subversion ;)

[07:34] <agentzh> moritz_: git also put something like .svn in the directories, which is not grep-friendly, no?

[07:34] <agentzh> *pugs

[07:34] <agentzh> *puts

[07:34] <moritz_> agentzh: just a .git in the top level dir

[07:35] <agentzh> hmm, sounds good :)

[07:35] <moritz_> agentzh: and it's compressed, so you won't accidently find files by grepping with rgrep $pattern .

[07:35] <agentzh> great

[07:35] <moritz_> .oO( or just use rgrep $pattern * )

[07:35] * agentzh goes to try git-svn.

[07:36] <agentzh> apparently svk is not "pugs-friendly"

[07:36] <moritz_> anyway, I'm off to university &

[07:36] <integral> avar: topaz is a failed rewrite of perl5 in C++, by chip.  

[07:36] <integral> It did funky stuff like changing the class of a C++ object at run time.  Crazy.

[07:37] <pmurias> integral: is changing the vtable at runtime allowed in standard C++?

[07:37] <Aankhen``> JUST USE MERCURIAL YOU HIPPIES

[07:37] <integral> pmurias: I'm not sure the standard actually requires you to use a vtable

[07:37] <Aankhen``> Mmm, everything sounds better when you make it uppercase and add the phrase "YOU HIPPIES" at the end.

[07:38] <pmurias> integral: you have to use an equivalent

[07:39] <cj> Aankhen``: is that the fanciest these days?  What about git?

[07:39] <Aankhen``> cj: Everyone seems to love git, I prefer Mercurial.  Mercurial shares *many* features with git, as it originated through the same chain of events; it just has a lot more polish than git.

[07:40] <integral> pmurias: but not an equivalent that allows mutation :-)

[07:42] <pmurias> integral: name a (semi-)sensible nomutable alternative

[07:43] <integral> instead of using pointers to pairs of (vtable,data);  use pairs of (vtable,pointer to data)

[07:43] <integral> so a function receiving one of these can't change its caller's idea of the object's type

[10:31] <agentzh> pmurias: not for kp6 ;)

[10:31] <pmurias> i know this

[10:31] <agentzh> pmurias: the plan is to write a Firefox addon for the tracer UI

[17:09] <TimToady> I always used dmake on Windows; I suppose that's strawberry Perl though

[17:09] <[particle]> i have nmake, make, and dmake. usually use nmake, cause that's what most winfolk are used to

[17:10] <[particle]> i guess we forgot to lock the back door, cause TimToady's back

[17:10] * TimToady came back around the front.  It's not that far...

[17:10] <TimToady> but I'm pretending to be a customer now

[17:11] <moritz_> TimToady: so you want to contribute to perl6 development now? ;-)

[17:11] <TimToady> DARN IT, WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG???

[17:11] <[particle]> ha!

[17:14] <[particle]> i think there's a synopsis or two that needs some fleshing out....

[17:16] <TimToady> those synopses are scary

[17:16] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:23] <cj> who wrote those anyway?

[17:23] <masak> TimToady: I can see the slashdot headlines: "Larry Wall intimidated by Perl 6 synopses: 'those synopses are scary'"

[17:23] <[particle]> wait till he looks at the implementations....

[17:24] <masak> [particle]: they're already a bit scary. pugs scares me sometimes.

[17:24] <masak> ...in a good way

[17:24] <[particle]> seems like pugs is waiting for the competition to catch up

[17:25] <[particle]> ...and waiting...

[17:25] <masak> :(

[17:26] <[particle]> everyone else has a new object model now... what about pugs?

[17:27] <masak> I think it has been on its way in since june

[17:27] <masak> it's residing somewhere in the computer and/or mind of audreyt++

[17:28] <masak> meanwhile, strange bugs are being found, like t/builtins/arrays/init-in-exported-sub.t

[17:29] <masak> I followed that one pretty far into the Pugs jungle, but in the end the scary noises of Haskell beasts got the better of me

[17:30] <integral> There is some stuff in the pugs svn that needs hooked up for the MO stuff.  But, either someone needs to just go ahead and Do it;  or they need to figure out how to find out the status from audreyt

[17:31] <masak> integral: I think both sound like a good idea

[17:31] <masak> who knows which one will pay off?

[17:31] <masak> maybe one, maybe both

[17:32] <masak> last I heard, audreyt was finding a sustainable lifestyle

[17:32] <masak> what that means for her possible reappearance here, I don't knoe

[17:33] <masak> s/knoe/know/

[17:33] <masak> is there someplace one can read up about the MO stuff?

[17:34] <masak> I don't think I can do anything about it, but it would be nice to be able to comprehend what needs changing and why

[17:52] <TimToady> the person to ask for MO documentation is probably nothingmuch

[17:52] <[particle]> ...who's trekking in peru atm.

[17:53] <masak> oh, so r15828 contains a lot of future goodness? like a branch?

[18:05] <TimToady> also stevan_ probably knows more about the theoretical end of MOP than anyone

[18:06] <[particle]> agreed. his mind is a theoretical kitchen floor.

[18:06] <TimToady> but he's not into Haskell as much, I suspect

[18:06] <masak> why not?

[18:06] <stevan_> cause he likes Ocaml bettter :P

[18:07] <TimToady> [particle]: MO is a dessert wax AND a floor topping!

[18:07] <stevan_> nothingmuch is currently hiking the moutains of South America,.. so he is uhm,... inaccessible :)

[18:07] <stevan_> masak: were you thinking of re-starting the MO Haskell effort?

[18:09] <stevan_> masak: you can also look at nothingmuch's MO talk slides here - http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/object_meta_programming_slides/slides/start.html

[18:09] <stevan_> it might help some 

[18:09] <TimToady> stevan_: so just rewrite pugs in Ocaml.  ^_^

[18:10] <masak> stevan_: thx

[18:10] <masak> stevan_: no, nothing so grand as re-starting an effort

[18:10] <masak> right now I'm just curious

[18:10] <stevan_> TimToady: k,.. I will start now, and should be done by thanksgiving 

[18:10] <stevan_> masak: the focus of MO was to break the MOP into 2 seperate peices

[18:10] <TimToady> er which...nevermind...

[18:11] <stevan_> TimToady: the thanksgiving shortly before the christmas release of perl 6 :)

[18:11] <stevan_> masak: MO builds meta objects in a purely functional way,.. so that they can be easily manipulated and transformed without breaking things too much

[18:11] <TimToady> but then you'd be able to write pugs in prerelease Perl 6 instead of Ocaml...

[18:12] <stevan_> true

[18:12] <stevan_> I was thinking the Ocaml dialect of Perl 6,..just grammer hacking yah know :)

[18:12] <TimToady> *nodnod* :)

[18:12] <stevan_> masak: MO does all this at "compile" time... 

[18:13] <stevan_> masak: then when its ready, it "emits" a class 

[18:13] <[particle]> i think that kind of statement deserves texas quotes.

[18:13] <stevan_> there is then a whole framework for the "runtime" of MO

[18:13] <stevan_> which handles the bits that couldnt be optimized away in compile time

[18:13] <stevan_> [particle]: what are texas quotes??

[18:14] <[particle]> <<texas quotes>>

[18:14] <stevan_> ah

[18:15] <stevan_> masak: MO is much eaiser to understand if you view at two seperate frameworks :)

[18:15] <stevan_> that said there are only 2 people who actually understand MO,.. audreyt and nothingmuch 

[18:16] <[particle]> you don't understand it, you just put it on cpan?

[18:16] <stevan_> no no,.. this is nuffin's baby

[18:16] <stevan_> his $pet_project for work

[18:17] <awwaiid> You don't have to understand The Matrix to employ it

[18:17] <stevan_> [particle]: he was annoyed by how I did the class compilation in Moose... and wanted to fix it

[18:17] <stevan_> he couldnt (blame perl5) and so decided to go out on the pure research limb and write MO instead

[18:17] <[particle]> ah, that's right. mo is moose without the ose

[18:18] <stevan_> yup

[18:18] <stevan_> it will probably serve as the basis for Moose v2

[18:18] <TimToady> can we have that by halloween?

[18:19] <[particle]> TimToady: wrong channel. try #ponie :P

[18:20] <masak> stevan_: cool! I already understand it a little better

[19:46] <moritz_> my_var=$(shell perl -e "foobar") iirc

[19:47] <moritz_> at least in GNU make

[19:47] <dlocaus> I have to use "nmake" :)

[19:48] <dlocaus> nmake (microsoft's make)

[19:51] * [particle] reads the fine manual

[19:55] <dlocaus> [particle]: I'm not sure nmake supports any method of my_var = $(shell perl -e "code")

[19:56] <[particle]> no, i can't find it

[19:56] <dlocaus> I think that Makefile.PL will have to do the expansion itself.

[19:56] <dlocaus> or code will have to be added to Makefile.PL to do the expansion.

[19:57] <[particle]> no, you can generate a file, and read it in
