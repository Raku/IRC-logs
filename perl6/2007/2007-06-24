[00:44] <Juerd> rsync preserves ownership data if the remote ssh has root

[00:44] <Juerd> So I created a VM for feather's rsync

[00:44] <Juerd> Not the best way to fix this, but it works. I hope

[05:36] <cipher1a> hey does nayone know of any good tutorials for beginners? i know  alittle bit, just not much

[05:37] *** obvio171 joined
[05:38] <daxim_> mind you, this is #perl6 here, about Perl 6.  the tutorials and teaching stuff is under /docs and /examples in the pugs tree.  if you really want Perl 5, that's over in #perl

[05:39] <cipher1a> got banned from that channel even though i never went in it... but thanks for the info

[05:41] <daxim_> you seem to be using tor.  then it could be that some other tor user broke the rules and you happen to use the same exit node

[05:42] <cipher1a> most likely

[05:43] <cipher1a> ok i just started using irc where is the pugs tree

[05:43] <Tene> https://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/

[05:44] <cipher1a> thank you lol

[05:45] *** cipher1a joined
[05:46] <daxim_> how long have you been doing perl 5?

[05:46] <cipher1a> couple weeks i guess

[05:49] <cipher1a> not long

[05:49] <cipher1a> on and off here and there when i get time

[05:56] *** devogon joined
[05:56] <masak> cipher1a: have you found CPAN yet? it's good to know about from the beginning

[05:58] <cipher1a> no i havnt

[05:58] <masak> @google cpan

[05:58] <lambdabot> http://www.cpan.org/

[05:58] <lambdabot> Title: CPAN

[05:58] <masak> @google search cpan

[05:58] <lambdabot> http://search.cpan.org/

[05:58] <lambdabot> Title: The CPAN Search Site - search.cpan.org

[05:58] <masak> it's a treasure trove of code already written for you

[05:59] <masak> it's perl5's genie in the bottle

[05:59] <daxim_> and to top it off, here's perlbot's standard answer to a tutorial request:

[05:59] <daxim_> http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Tutorials | http://perl.com/cs/user/query/q/6?id_topic=74 | http://learn.perl.org/ | http://books.perl.org/onlinebooks | http://perl-begin.org/tutorials/ | http://learn.perl.org/library/beginning_perl/

[05:59] <masak> :)

[05:59] <masak> good one

[06:00] <daxim_> give me karma, harhar

[06:00] <cipher1a> yea but code written for me doesnt help me learn

[06:00] <masak> daxim_++ # greedy bastard :)

[06:00] <cipher1a> thanks for the tutorial websites

[06:01] <masak> cipher1a: no, it doesn't help you to learn. it just helps you write less code

[06:02] <cipher1a> lol true, but im not looking up perl to write programs i need, just to learn it

[06:02] <cipher1a> so i can write a perl program when i do need to

[06:07] <Tene> basically what masak is saying is that using cpan is an important part of learning to use perl.

[07:38] * Aankhen`` wonders if it makes any sense for something to be double lazy.

[07:38] <Aankhen``> s/double/doubly/

[07:38] <Tene> my $l = lazy { lazy { 3 } };

[07:38] <Tene> ;)

[07:39] <Aankhen``> Yes, but does it make any sense?

[07:39] <Tene> Not particularly meaningful sense, no.

[07:39] <Aankhen``> I mean, no matter how lazy it is, it's all evaluated at once when the value is needed and no sooner, right?

[07:39] <Tene> pretty much, yeah

[07:39] <Tene> However, you can have a lazy computation depend on another lazily-generated value.

[07:39] <Aankhen``> Okay, good.  I was trying to sort it all out in my head and it's good to know I'm not insane in that direction. :-)

[07:40] <Aankhen``> Yeah, that's not exactly related though. :-P

[07:40] <Tene> my $extrastatistics = lazy { expensiveprocessing($some_lazy_data) }

[07:40] <Aankhen``> Yup.

[07:40] <Aankhen``> Thunk upon thunk upon thunk.

[07:40] <Aankhen``> I was reading today about how it can be dangerous in some situations in Haskell.

[07:41] <Aankhen``> (You just keep building up a chain of thunks that overflows the stack.)

[07:44] <lumi> Heap?

[07:45] <Aankhen``> The page I was on talked about overflowing the stack.
