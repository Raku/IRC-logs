[05:17] <agentzh> ingy: yes

[05:17] <ingy> what's up?

[05:17] <agentzh> i have a malformed .yml

[05:17] <agentzh> http://feather.perl6.nl/agent/tmp/smoke.yml

[05:18] <agentzh> it was generated by YAML::Syck, or YAML

[05:18] <ingy> isn't that like 9 million lines?

[05:18] <agentzh> but i can't parse it using either YAML::Syck or YAML.

[05:18] <agentzh> ingy: *nod*

[05:18] <ingy> but it is likely due to one line

[05:19] <agentzh> this is the output of YAML.pm

[05:19] <agentzh> it seems that the first line should use " instead of '.

[05:20] <agentzh> not sure. but changing '...' to "..." makes the parser go further.

[05:20] <ingy> yeah the build_info line is bad

[05:20] <agentzh> so this is a YAML::Syck emitter problem?

[05:20] <ingy> I think so

[05:20] <ingy> YAML.pm did not create that

[05:21] <agentzh> i'll try YAML.pm to generate that .yml in pugs smoke system.

[05:21] <agentzh> ingy: thanks for the help!

[05:21] <ingy> YAML.pm might have it's own issues :\ but try it!

[05:21] <agentzh> okay :)

[05:22] <ingy> it's funny but the scape forms in YAML vary from double to single

[05:22] * agentzh has to do another 16min pugs smoke in order to regen the .yml file.

[05:22] <ingy> "This has \"escaped quotes\""

[05:23] <ingy> 'This has ''escaped quotes'''

[05:23] <agentzh> yes.

[05:23] <agentzh> i've noticed that.

[05:23] <ingy> "''" is the only escape in single

[05:24] <ingy> if we used \' then we'd have to also support \\

[10:54] <agentzh> sounds good

[10:54] <Juerd> I've even wrapped /bin/false to fool automated processes into doing something else :)

[10:55] <Juerd> (On a fully dedicated virtual server)

[10:56] <agentzh> hehe

[10:58] <agentzh> okay, "./pugs ..." is hard-coded in util/run-smoke.pl

[10:58] <agentzh> i think it's easier to change that line of code. ;)

[11:01] <agentzh> maybe i can introduce a HARNESS_PUGS environment.

[11:01] <Alias__> PUGS_HARNESS

[11:01] <Alias__> If you're going to do it, use french ordering :)

[11:02] <agentzh> Alias__: but HARNESS_PERL is already in use.

[11:02] <agentzh> PUGS_HARNESS may lead to inconsistency.

[11:02] <Alias__> agentzh, consider it an improvement :)

[11:02] <agentzh> oh my god...

[11:13] <Limbic_Region> what GHC is feather running these days?

[11:14] <agentzh> 6.6

[11:14] <Limbic_Region> hrm, I wonder how fast it would be using 6.7

[11:15] <agentzh> Limbic_Region: smoking on feather is quite slow, fyi.

[11:15] <agentzh> that is the result on my machine. ;)

[11:15] <Limbic_Region> oh

[11:16] <Limbic_Region> well, smoke time on my machine is circa 30 minutes 

[11:16] <agentzh> with concurrent set to 1?

[11:17] <agentzh> mine is 2.

[11:17] <Limbic_Region> I was just getting to that

[11:17] <Juerd> agentzh: What are your box's specs?

[11:17] <agentzh> Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 2.4 GHz, 1 GB RAM, ASUS P5B-E motherboard

[11:18] <Limbic_Region> I hacked in the code to get concurrency smoking on Win32 using Parallel::ForkManager

[11:18] <Limbic_Region> grrrr - I hate this client

[11:18] <agentzh> Limbic_Region++

[11:19] <Limbic_Region> unfortunately, part way through the smoke - one of the threads just dies intermittently and inconsistently

[11:19] <Limbic_Region> so yes, concurrency set to 1 and no whizbang ghc options either

[11:19] <Limbic_Region> so yes, concurrency set to 1 and no whizbang ghc options either

[11:20] <agentzh> :)

[11:21] <Limbic_Region> I have an idea on how to isolate and fix it but I haven't had the tuits 

[11:22] <Limbic_Region> then it forks 1 instance to run all the tests in that chunk

[11:22] <Limbic_Region> basically the way the current code works is it divides the total number of tests into equal chunks based off concurrent=n

[11:22] <Limbic_Region> those are out of order btw

[11:22] * agentzh is so happy that he is no longer suffering from win32

[11:22] *** TimToady joined
[11:23] * moritz stopped suffering two years ago

[11:23] <Limbic_Region> agentzh - well sure, and I could abandon it myself but then who would we have making sure it is still a viable option

[11:23] <agentzh> Limbic_Region: yeah, that's a good point.

[11:24] <Limbic_Region> there aren't that many folks using Win32 for parrot or pugs

[11:24] <agentzh> and i bet there're fewer and fewer.

[11:24] <agentzh> i'm only running windows in my virtual machine these days.

[11:25] <Limbic_Region> well, at work I mostly run a real unix (HPUX, Solaris, AIX, etc) and at home Win32

[11:25] <Limbic_Region> while I have linux and cygwin as options at home, I feel comfortable in either enviornment

[11:26] <agentzh> how about virus?

[11:26] <moritz> viruses are overrated

[11:26] <moritz> if you know something about computers

[11:26] <Limbic_Region> agentzh - most people get virii because they are idiots

[11:26] <Limbic_Region> agentzh - most people get virii because they are idiots

[11:26] <Limbic_Region> grrrr

[11:26] <moritz> .oO(and don't use MSIE)

[11:27] <agentzh> i think the situation is much more serious in .cn.

[11:27] <Alias__> moritz: Turn off firewall exception, keep up to date with Windows Update, and don't use IE or Outlook, and everything is fine, in my experience

[11:27] <Alias__> <-- 5 years with no anti-virus, and no viruses

[11:28] <agentzh> the viruses are ubiquitous here.

[11:28] <Alias__> The answer to "Well how do you know you don't have one if you don't run anti-virus" is "I install one from time to time to double check"

[11:28] <moritz> Alias__: that's my opinion as well (except for the firewall - firewalls are there to separate networks)

[11:28] <moritz> Alias__: but I don't use it anymore

[11:29] <Alias__> moritz: The windows firewall might not be great, but it's something

[11:29] <Limbic_Region> well, hw and sw based firewalls serve different purposes these days IMO

[11:29] <Alias__> Actually, I generally think the NAT is more important than the Win32 firewall anyways

[11:29] <moritz> Alias__: not if you use IPv6

[11:29] <Alias__> NATs don't work with IPv6?

[11:30] <moritz> and you don't need a firewall if you have no software working listening on open ports

[11:30] <moritz> Alias__: you don't need it, because you've got enough IPs 

[11:30] <Limbic_Region> moritz: I would never expect a hw based fw to block a program from accessing a remote network based on the program executable but rather on ports, src, dst, etc.  A sw based firewall otoh

[11:30] <Alias__> moritz, I like it for the network isolate mostly

[11:30] <Alias__> isolation

[11:31] <moritz> Alias__: but that's not what it is made for

[11:31] <moritz> Alias__: and therefore not very secure

[11:31] <Alias__> moritz, Many technologies have their nice side-effects

[11:32] <Alias__> An isolated self-managed network segment is a good thing

[11:32] <moritz> Alias__: yes, but if you don't know if NAT works the way you think it does, you shouldn't use it for its side effects

[11:32] <moritz> with IPv6 that is

[11:32] <Alias__> :)

[11:32] <Alias__> Anyways, I don't get viruses, so all is right in my world

[15:37] <agentzh> a friend of mine once asked me why a byte is of 8 bits.

[15:37] <TimToady> well, the PDP-8 my wife programmed in high school had 12-bit words

[15:37] <moritz> agentzh: what did you answer?

[15:37] <[particle]> TimToady: that reminds me of switching from saxophone to clarinet

[15:38] <moritz> agentzh: "computer scientist love powers of two"?

[15:38] <agentzh> moritz: i told him because ASCII code has 7 bits and the people want to feel safer and add one more

[15:38] <TimToady> lol

[15:38] <moritz> *g* nice explanation ;-)

[15:38] *** Blacksitox joined
[15:38] <agentzh> thanks :D

[15:38] <TimToady> and then the Europeans all added one more, and did we feel safer?

[15:39] <TimToady> I don't think so...

[15:39] *** Blacksitox left
[15:40] * agentzh wants to hear TimToady's explanation.

[15:40] *** rashakil__ joined
[15:41] <TimToady> I think the ASCII explanation is basically correct, from a cultural point of view.  When people started programming PDP-11s and doing a lot of string processing, they decided it was convenient that it came close to a power of two, and stuck with it.

[15:42] <TimToady> and it was also fairly obvious about then that the next generation would be 32-bit processors, and then you get 4 chars into it.

[15:43] <TimToady> but I think the powers-of-two argument was kind of a post-facto rationalization of the ASCII culture

[15:43] <TimToady> basically, Pascal and C thought in bytes, so everything else followed along.

[15:45] * TimToady remembers various contortions of trying to rationalize the type system of C on some weird old architectures that were not amenable to bytes...

[15:46] *** amnesiac joined
[15:46] <TimToady> and the term "byte" itself had not yet settled on 8 bits

[15:46] * moritz thinks of "mix", Donald E. Knuth's assembler, that doesn't rely on a fixed byte size

[15:46] <TimToady> yes.  36-bit computers tended to use 6 bit characters

[15:47] <[particle]> octet is the correct term, but byte has become a synonym

[15:47] <TimToady> byte is now the correct term.  octet will die eventually

[15:47] <TimToady> and go back to being 8 singers.

[15:48] <TimToady> except for in standards documents, where it will likely remain a shibboleth

[15:48] <TimToady> like "the data are" in Scientific American

[15:48] <TimToady> when everyone else says "the data is" using it as a mass noun.

[15:49] <TimToady> but you aren't allowed to be a good scientist if you say "the data is voluminous".

[15:49] <[particle]> that always got me... datum is singular, no?

[15:49] <TimToady> in latin

[15:50] <[particle]> yes, in latin

[15:50] <TimToady> I speak English

[15:50] <nothingmuch> data set

[15:50] <TimToady> which is also wrong latin, since you'd probably need a different ending on data to use it as an adjective.

[15:50] <nothingmuch> hmm

[15:51] *** fglock joined
[15:51] <[particle]> ataday

[15:51] <nothingmuch> for some reason I thought you could say things like "plural_nown set" and it works, but now i see it's all wrong

[15:51] <nothingmuch> IS BORK

[15:51] <nothingmuch> nown... sheesh

[15:52] <TimToady> indeed, you've just shown that people who use "data set" are using data as a singular, I think.  :)

[15:52] <nothingmuch> yep =)

[15:52] <TimToady> cool.

[15:52] <[particle]> maybe it's "datas set"

[15:54] <TimToady> generally, flies are not amenable to having things made up on them, I'll grant you.

[15:55] <TimToady> I just twist things around in my head until they come out wrong, I guess.

[15:55] * nothingmuch bows down with great respect either way

[15:56] <[particle]> and to think... there's a whole subculture that  bows down with great respect at that....

[16:00] <nothingmuch> [particle]: i just like jokes i can appreciate

[16:01] <nothingmuch> i have a kinda strange taste for em, but TimToady's are like my dad's joke only consistently very high quality

[16:01] <nothingmuch> i guess dad's jokes (which have occasional gems but are usually lame) kinda spoiled me

[16:02] <TimToady> well, you only see the ones I take time to type, which gives some review time

[16:02] <TimToady> if you had to live with me you'd get the bad ones too...

[16:02] <TimToady> Glo often complains that I just throw them out to see if they're funny

[16:03] <[particle]> fascinating that we get the family-approved comedy

[16:32] <[particle]> not that i can think of

[16:32] <TimToady> mlenz: yes

[16:33] <TimToady> mlenz: except / would be illegal

[16:33] <TimToady> since punctuation is now all reserved.

[16:33] <[particle]> fglock: can you get the behavior you want by using :init ?

[16:33] <mlenz> vim's perl6.vim doesn't recognize both of them in { } delimited tokens

[16:34] *** perlmonkey2 joined
[16:34] <TimToady> the punctuation simplification should help vim inside regex, I suspect.

[16:34] <fglock> [particle]: not sure what you mean; in 6-on-6, I'm adding a logger to Scalar.STORE

[16:34] <TimToady> since you don't have to keep track of what's meta any more.

[16:36] * mlenz is scared of vim's regex dialect ;-)

[16:36] <offby1> it's coming for you!

[16:37] <mlenz> and $/<foo> is the same as $<foo>, right?

[17:37] <gaal> agentzh: cool.

[17:40] <agentzh> gaal: the problem is the rev numbers for the pugs test suite and the pugs smoke results will differ.

[17:40] <agentzh> because updating of the test suite will be much more frequent.

[17:40] <agentzh> (once an hour)

[17:41] <agentzh> so we will expect some mismatch between the tests and the test results.

[17:43] <gaal> agentzh: I think this is a *wonderful* first approximation.

[17:43] <agentzh> *nod* :)

[17:43] <gaal> agentzh++! we can improve this later.

[17:43] <agentzh> right :)

[17:46] <agentzh> it's still very slow on feather.

[17:49] <gaal> how long does a smoke take on feather?

[17:50] <gaal> I'm guessing about an hour, with average load

[17:51] <agentzh> 80 min or so, i'd say.
