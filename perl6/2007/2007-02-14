[01:42] <shamu> anyone interested in fielding a source filter question?  It's a perl 5 question, but I was hoping to ask here because I suspect the population is a bit more sophisticated in this channel.  If you can recommend another channel, I'd appreciate it.

[02:00] <shamu> Well, I'll put my toe in the water anyway ... :-)

[02:01] <shamu> I was wondering if someone had heard of a filter that would let me test individual subs in a monolithic script

[02:01] <shamu> e.g., a subsidiary script 'testdb.pl' that could have a line of the form

[02:01] <shamu> IMPORT_SUB 'db_connect';

[02:02] <shamu> IMPORT_SUB 'foo.pl:db_connect';

[02:02] <shamu> the source filter would pull db_connect's prototype out of foo.pl and stick it near the top of the test script, and pull the sub body out and put it near the bottom

[02:03] <shamu> that way people developing foo.pl could keep working and the test script could test the functions by referring into it

[02:03] <shamu> I looked at the source filter stuff, but it looked a bit daunting

[02:11] <TimToady> hmm, no clue myself

[03:28] <cj> my manager is trying to talk me into switching our codebase from perl to java.  good fun there.

[03:29] <tene> cj: why?

[03:29] <SamB> obviously his manager is insane

[03:30] <cj> tene: probably because a different tier is in java and they don't want to have to pass the service results from one format to another

[03:30] <tene> there are java-specific data formats that perl can't talk to?

[03:31] <cj> tene: :)

[03:31] <tene> Serious question.

[07:18] <tene> they block other DNS requests?

[07:18] <jisom> probably to restrict your web usage and track where you go and what you send, be afraid, be very afraid!!!

[07:18] <jisom> or they're just trying to make it all more secure, who knows

[07:19] <GeJ> This is just moronic. 

[07:20] <allbery_b> did they decide, or did twhoever's other DNS you were using blck recursive queries?

[07:21] <GeJ> they block 25, but leave 587 untouched.

[07:21] <allbery_b> or perhaps other problems, like ECE's blocks TCP so if a result is >512 bytes the fallback to TCP fails (thus, when I was using ECE's nameservers instead of Speakeasy's from home, I couldn't look up google.com)

[07:22] <allbery_b> (or other akamaized services)

[07:22] <GeJ> and for DNS, I just can't connect other boxes on 53

[07:22] <tene> That's... lame.

[07:22] <tene> What ISP?

[07:22] <allbery_b> yug

[07:23] <allbery_b> but, I'm betting I know why that is

[07:23] <GeJ> small one on a small island in the middele of the pacific ocean

[07:23] <allbery_b> there's a virus out there that hammers a bunch of DNS servers to look up hosts from which it downloads its payload

[07:23] <allbery_b> some ISPs have taken to forcing use of their DNS and blocking those queries

[07:25] * allbery_b is having to deal with that one at work, someone panicked and called in the FBI on us because they have infected machines querying our nameservers

[13:09] <avar> why would something that's a "sick cult" not a count as a religion?

[13:10] <shay> I'm travelling home in an hour

[13:10] <shay> gotta get ready

[13:10] <shay> see you laters

[13:11] <lichtkind> it contradicts is proposed goals

[13:11] <Juerd> avar: Or vice versa, which is a question that popped up in my head when I read some holy books.

[13:11] * avar wanders off

[13:11] <lichtkind> good bye

[13:11] <avar> lichtkind: You're assuming that a "religion" needs to have some inherant goals

[13:11] <Juerd> It's a good thing that modern followers no longer interpret those books literally.

[13:11] <lichtkind> yes the latin word religio proposes its goal

[13:12] <Juerd> lichtkind: Religion requires spirituality? Why would that be?

[13:12] <lumi> lichtkind: What are these proposed goals?

[13:12] <avar> religion is just an adherence to some belief

[13:12] <lichtkind> the goal to lead you back to god

[13:12] <lichtkind> thats by definition spiritual

[13:13] <Juerd> o/` What if God was one of us?

[13:13] <lumi> That seems to limit "religion" to something very much like Christianity

[13:13] <lichtkind> we are god

[13:13] *** buetow joined
[13:13] <avar> No, there have been hundreds of thousands of religions throughout human history. The definition you propose doesn't cover them

[13:13] <wolverian> now you sound like satanists :)

[13:13] <Juerd> lichtkind: Perversely, I like that thought :)

[13:13] <lumi> Thou art God

[13:13] <avar> but meh, /me gone

[13:13] <Juerd> Hm. "lumi".

[13:13] <Juerd> Another bright nickname :)

[13:13] <Juerd> Bye, avar 

[13:14] <lumi> Juerd: It's a snowy one :)

[13:14] <Juerd> Snowy?

[13:14] <lumi> lumi is Finnish for snow

[13:14] <Juerd> wolverian: It all depends on one's Rorschach Test results ;)

[13:14] <Juerd> lumi: Ah

[13:15] <Juerd> lumi: I interpreted it as short for luminance

[13:15] <lichtkind> wolverian i think satanism is stupid, but with many things they say are they more correct that christians :)

[13:15] <lumi> Lumi & Chroma -- They Fight Crime

[13:16] <wolverian> lichtkind, laveyan satanism? 

[13:16] <merlyn> against the evil "Hugh"

[13:16] <Juerd> Hm. "One last song before I leave" doesn't work if it's a one hour mp3.

[13:16] <lichtkind> wolverian that too

[13:16] <wolverian> I find it pretty intuitive, though I'm not sure if it's a religion. :)

[13:17] <merlyn> maybe satanism is just being the devil's advocate about christianity? :)

[13:17] <lichtkind> Juerd how you came to that conclusion?

[13:17] <wolverian> completely atheistic religions are weird. 

[13:17] <Juerd> Ehm. The devil is playing with my mp3 player.

[13:17] <Juerd> My squeezebox just randomly selected Bach's "Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern".

[13:17] <merlyn> s/devil/RIAA/

[13:17] <lichtkind> hahah

[13:18] <wolverian> squeezebox++ # that's scary 

[13:18] <merlyn> but that's redundant

[13:18] <Juerd> I must admit that I am indeed more than surprised.

[13:27] <wolverian> lichtkind, I find the name somewhat silly, and I don't feel like I need the religious (albeit atheist) aspects of it, so I don't think so. I do consider the philosophy sensible.

[16:45] <Cafe_> is there any online POD reader tool wich I can give an URL??

[16:45] <lichtkind> hello cafe

[16:45] <lichtkind> dunno but i wanted to write an offline podreader

[16:45] <lichtkind> but its merely in my head today

[16:46] <wolverian> lichtkind, what's wrong with perldoc? :)

[16:46] <wolverian> (well, okay, many things.)

[16:47] <lichtkind> we want to have tabs, better search and some other stuff

[16:47] <lichtkind> beside thats its a demo for an techology

[16:47] <moritz> written in perl6? ;)

[16:47] <lichtkind> for an supersecret perl.com article i hopefully finish some day

[16:47] <lichtkind> of couse not :)

[16:48] <Cafe_> perldoc is nice for text mode

[16:48] <Cafe_> but I wish something like CPAN's reader, but suplying an URL for it to read

[16:49] <lichtkind> what ya mean?

[16:49] <wolverian> pinfo is nice.. too bad I can't find a pod2info

[16:50] <wolverian> (though perldoc perlamiga (!) mentions it)

[16:50] <lichtkind> info is another format?

[16:50] <wolverian> yeah. gnu apps traditionally are documented with it.

[16:50] <wolverian> the default reader happens to suck, though. pinfo is nice.

[16:50] <avar> wolverian: emacs is a better info reader than pinfo imo

[16:51] *** weinig|bbl is now known as weinig

[16:51] <wolverian> avar, probably. using it just for info reading feels a bit silly, though.

[16:52] <avar> I don't use info(1) but I don't think it's all that bad

[16:52] <moritz> avar: it is ;)

[16:52] <wolverian> compared to pinfo, it is.

[16:52] <avar> haha

[16:53] <avar> pinfo emacs brings up the man page, how sucky

[16:53] <wolverian> try installing emacs's info docs? :)

[16:53] <avar> I have emacs's info docs

[16:54] <moritz> very intuitive for vi users ;)

[16:54] <wolverian> yup :)

[17:42] <TimToady> lichtkind: yes, as long as you don't call me tim.  :)

[17:42] <lichtkind> ai sir :)

[17:43] <lichtkind> so i ask you another time , (but that are easy questions :))

[17:43] <TimToady> you may ask now

[17:43] <TimToady> feeling dead was mostly just a joke

[17:44] <lichtkind> im mostly to serious to understand jokes :)

[17:45] <TimToady> I'm sure I don't feel nearly as dead as Audrey does right now... :/

[17:45] <lichtkind> ok im writing currently a piece about perl6 and in chapter 1 about the main goal of perl and i wont to get a bit spiritual

[17:45] <lichtkind> audrey is by you?

[17:45] <TimToady> no, half a world away

[17:46] <lichtkind> its about the mathew quate the name perl is derived from

[17:46] <TimToady> I would not say "derived from", merely one of the many associations

[17:47] * dmq idly wonders if p6 will use inversion lists for its charclasses, and if yes if they are already written yet (in C) and if yes, can i steal them?

[17:47] <moritz> dmq: p6 and C?

[17:47] <lichtkind> yeah but feel free like in heaven while be creative is the main goal of perl as i understand

[17:48] <TimToady> p6 has no opinions about implementation

[17:49] <dmq> im just on the prowl for an inversion list implementation, and was hoping you guys might have one.

[17:50] <TimToady> it's certainly true that my particular theology says that good behavior must come from the inside of the person, not be imposed from without

[17:50] <TimToady> and that certainly relates to allowing people to exercise free will

[17:51] <lichtkind> yes also because vreativity without free will is no fun :)

[17:51] <lichtkind> creativity

[17:52] <TimToady> I think God is lot more like audreyt++ than even audreyt++ realizes. :)

[17:52] <TimToady> She's always saying "use your initiative"

[17:53] <lichtkind> also has perl matured a lot last times sinse best practises and perl::Critic is around :)

[17:53] *** BooK_ joined
[17:53] <lichtkind> sorry what you mean with initative?

[17:53] <lichtkind> you mean intuition?

[17:53] <TimToady> enforcement of cultural norms has its place, but cannot substitute for the goodness that comes from within

[17:54] <lichtkind> true

[17:54] <TimToady> it means "figure it out yourself"

[17:55] <TimToady> to initiate is to start something, so "initiative" is the quality of someone who is a self-starter

[17:55] <dmq> leo says "die Initiative ergreifen"

[17:56] <lichtkind> dmq thanks btu i understand

[17:57] <lichtkind> makes sense to me

[17:58] <TimToady> anyway, my goal is not to tell people how they have to program, but rather to encourage people to *become* good programmers

[17:58] <lichtkind> so lower the hurdles to all the features

[17:58] <lichtkind> without making it php like :)

[17:58] <dmq> timtoady, p6 does sortof suggest that certain implementations will be better than others, since you have mandated char class set operations. so the implementation must be ameniable to that.

[17:59] <TimToady> dmq: what implementation you want for character classes depends on what you're optimizing for

[17:59] <lichtkind> TimToaday sounds a nit like wisdom through experience to me

[18:00] *** weinig is now known as weinig|bbl

[18:00] <dmq> handle unicode, facilitate set operations, not blow up in terms of storage on large sets.

[18:02] <TimToady> yes, we attempt to specify the semantics, but there are various space vs time tradeoffs the implementation can make depending on whether your device has 500 kilobytes or 500 terabytes of memory

[18:02] <dmq> it seems to me like inversions lists have the upper hand in almost every respect except multibyte equivelencies.

[18:03] <dmq> there dont seem to be too many reasonable options. even if you do have 500 terabytes of memory. :-)

[18:03] *** xinming_ joined
[18:04] <dmq> if you know of any besides bitvectors, tries and inversion lists please let me know.

[18:04] <TimToady> well, with that kind of memory you don't care about a small table with only 0x10ffff entries.  :)

[18:04] <dmq> yeah. :-)

[18:05] <TimToady> but your telephone is likely to want a slow but small algorithm

[18:06] <dmq> yeah, worst case invlist is 0x10FFFF entries as well. hrmm.

[18:06] *** bernhard joined
[18:07] <dmq> although anybody that manages to write a charclass that creates such a list deserves what happens to them :-)

[18:07] <TimToady> for your phone, the most compact representation is probably the original character class specified by the user, and you just interpret that.

[18:08] <dmq> not a bad point

[18:10] <TimToady> course when you start pulling in Unicode properties, you start getting long lists of characters.

[18:11] <TimToady> but presumably those would be stored in one place and accessed indirectly

[18:11] <TimToady> and if phones start getting to have too much memory, I'm sure we'll have smaller embedded devices that need compact storage

[18:12] <TimToady> how much memory do your nanobots have, for instance?

[18:12] <lichtkind> TimToady thanks for answers i want hype chamelessly perl6 but not bullshiting around, currently i think hard if theres another question on my mind

[18:13] <TimToady> leaving theology out of it, religions work best if they're scalable

[18:13] <TimToady> they have to be accessible to a child, and still interest the philosophers

[18:14] <[particle]> i think that's why frisbeetarianism never took off

[18:14] <lichtkind> so all can contribute something interesting :)

[18:14] <lichtkind> and some child can be clearer in mind than philosopher :)

[18:14] <TimToady> and one never gets to a spot where you say "I've arrived" and don't need to improve any more.

[18:15] <lichtkind> ah now i get it perl6 is the sucessor of WoW

[18:15] <TimToady> but humans love their false minima

[18:15] <TimToady> World of Warcraft?

[18:15] <lichtkind> yes

[18:16] <TimToady> don't know anything about it...

[18:16] <lichtkind> some of my friends are unhealthy addicted and süpend nearly all their life in this world

[18:16] <lichtkind> its mass epidemia

[18:16] <lichtkind> your never finished

[18:16] <lichtkind> every 2 weeks content updates

[18:17] <lichtkind> gigantic worlds

[18:17] <lichtkind> trees of characters and possibilities

[18:17] <lichtkind> but its based on getting points for killing people

[18:18] <lichtkind> it ment to be joke that perl6 is programmers WoW

[18:18] <TimToady> it is a mystery of human existence that forward motion depends on having good balance.

[18:19] <TimToady> we tend to think of balance as a static

[18:19] <TimToady> thing

[18:19] <lichtkind> yes balance is one of the most important things in WoW

[18:19] <lichtkind> the founded their own term: inba

[18:19] <[particle]> like riding a bicycle

[18:19] <TimToady> but all progress depends on lack of balance.

[18:19] <lichtkind> stands for inbalanced

[18:20] <lichtkind> they say it all the time if they dont like something

[18:20] <TimToady> and the most unbalanced often make the most progress before they crash

[18:20] <TimToady> "all progress depends on the unreasonable man"

[18:20] <lichtkind> i know that one :)

[18:20] <TimToady> oh, you know me, huh?  :)

[18:20] <lichtkind> WoW is very interesting for linguist because they created their own language

[18:21] <lichtkind> no that quote from shaw :)

[18:21] * allbery_b suspects we're *all* unreasonable here :)

[18:21] <TimToady> I'll bet it's biased towards Indo-European...

[18:21] <nothingmuch> i'm perfectly reasonable

[18:21] <nothingmuch> it's just that many other people are unreasonable about accepting that fact

[18:22] <TimToady> well, I try to be unreasonable as often as possible, but I'm not very good at it.

[18:23] <allbery_b> @remember TimToady well, I try to be unreasonable as often as possible, but I'm not very good at it.

[18:23] <lambdabot> Done.

[18:23] <lichtkind> but to have fun is sometimes enough :)

[18:23] <lichtkind> ah one i forgot

[18:24] <lichtkind> i mean on theological point

[18:24] <lichtkind> because were from god we are creative, creativity as a birthright, and perl just dont try to get into my way

[18:26] <lichtkind> i think thats + the previous talked about are the points i want to make

[18:26] <TimToady> within reason.  God still classifies some behaviors as syntax errors.

[18:26] *** rashakil__ joined
[18:27] <lichtkind> you mean like murder and stealing?

[18:27] <TimToady> yes, those definitely throw an exception.

[18:28] <TimToady> and erroneous programs have bad consequences even if the compiler doesn't tell you beforehand.

[18:31] <TimToady> "there is a way that seems right to a man, but the end of it is death" is just a restatement (or a prestatement) of the Halting Problem.

[18:32] <lichtkind> i dont understand

[18:32] <TimToady> so another way to state the free will thing is that we are intended to be interesting programs, not programs that can be "proven correct".

[18:33] <TimToady> "there is a way that seems right to a man, but the end of it is death" is a verse from the Bible.

[18:33] <lichtkind> i seldom read much bible, and only in german :)

[18:34] <lichtkind> im no christian in any way, only share some insights :)

[18:35] <TimToady> I don't expect anyone to be a Christian who isn't yet.  :)

[18:35] <lichtkind> shii i missed that one too. please explain

[18:35] <lichtkind> they even failed to make me a communist

[18:36] <TimToady> a lot of Christians fall into the trap of expecting everyone to behave like Christians.  I don't expect that.

[18:37] <lichtkind> thats wise :)

[18:38] <TimToady> on the other hand, I also try not to fall into the trap of thinking that people won't change their mind on the subject.

[18:38] *** Limbic_Region joined
[18:38] <lichtkind> :)

[18:39] <lichtkind> i was lot flogged in wikipedia for standing to my esoteric beliefs thatswhy i sometime make this second mistake

[18:42] <lichtkind> i dont think god classifies, but we cant make perl6 complex as the universe itself :)

[18:42] <TimToady> it's part of The Plan.  :)

[18:42] <lichtkind> since it will always be an subset

[18:42] <TimToady> thats enough.

[18:43] <allbery_b> no, but p6 can be as complex as the human mind, just by being used and extended by human minds

[18:44] <TimToady> hmm, I guess I don't even aspire to that height.  I think humanity will always be a little more complex than Perl.  :)

[18:44] <lichtkind> its not too far http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,2009217,00.html

[18:44] <lambdabot> Title: The brain scan that can read people's intentions | Science | Guardian Unlimited

[18:45] <lichtkind> yes its i nice thougth to run perl in the brain but i dont think thats the goal

[18:46] <lichtkind> one of the reasons why programming is fun it is a way to communicate with a machine

[18:46] <TimToady> I should just get my brain scanned for intentions and then I wouldn't have to write all the specs...

[18:46] <dmq> you are planning to solve intentionality in perl6?

[18:46] <dmq> yikes. ;-)

[18:46] <TimToady> if I do, it'll be unintentional...
