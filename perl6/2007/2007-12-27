[16:22] * ruoso going to IKEA &

[16:22] <fglock_> ruoso: will look

[16:23] <fglock_> now reading through the PIR compiler to see what can be done about making :outer less static

[16:27] <fglock_> PIR seems to have "zero" support for lexical-scoped eval()

[16:30] <fglock_> though I'm puzzled about this line in imcc/pbc.c:  current = CONTEXT(interp->ctx)->current_sub

[16:30] <fglock_> it looks like it is trying to get the lexical context

[18:30] <fglock_> pmurias: in the end, kp6-parrot will need to implement it's own lexicals

[18:30] <fglock_> so we are back to the "Scope" implementation

[18:31] <fglock_> pmurias: what is the state of the optimizations you were trying out?

[18:31] *** r0bby joined

[18:33] <pmurias> i'm sceptical the would give any decent speedups

[18:33] <fglock_> you said some tests were failing, is this still happening?

[18:34] <pmurias> yes

[18:35] <fglock_> I think we'd better don't bootstrap in kp6-MOP, and focus on parrot, perl5-v6.pm, and yap6

[18:35] <pmurias> i think that too

[18:35] <fglock_> if you can call that "focus" :P

[18:36] <fglock_> would you try to revert something until the tests pass again?

[18:36] <fglock_> I'll start working on the lexical scopes again, I guess

[18:37] <pmurias> fglock_: i think all tests work with the normal emitters

[18:37] <fglock_> ah, ok
