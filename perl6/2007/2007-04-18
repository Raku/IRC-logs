[03:36] <agentzh> :)

[03:38] <agentzh> it only took 84.35 min.

[03:38] <agentzh> (shorter than i expected)

[03:39] <geoffb> Well, that's good I suppose

[03:39] <agentzh> gaal: gotcha

[03:39] <agentzh> geoffb: *nod* :D

[03:40] <agentzh> geoffb: are you familiar with sh?

[03:40] <geoffb> Bourne Shell, you mean?

[03:40] <agentzh> i'm having a problem with wrapping ./pugs with a sh script.

[03:40] <agentzh> yup

[03:40] <veritos> geoffb: what's the deal?

[03:41] <geoffb> some ... ask away, I may know

[03:41] <agentzh> is it correct to write "./pugs $*" to do that.

[03:41] <agentzh> ?

[03:41] <geoffb> veritos: huh?

[03:41] <veritos> geoffb: i was asking what your question was.

[03:41] <geoffb> veritos: er, I didn't have one

[03:42] <agentzh> geoffb: see http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/util/limited_pugs

[03:42] * geoffb is looking

[03:43] <revdiablo> agentzh: ./pugs "$@"

[03:43] <agentzh> revdiablo: thanks :)

[03:43] <agentzh> ./pugs $* is giving me troubles.

[03:44] <agentzh> so is ./pugs "$*".

[03:44] <revdiablo> $* will do word splitting after the fact

[03:44] <revdiablo> "$*" will quote all the args as one big argument to pugs

[03:44] *** amnesiac_ is now known as amnesiac

[03:44] <revdiablo> "$@" is a special case that Does The Right Thing

[03:44] <agentzh> revdiablo: fair enough :)

[03:44] <geoffb> agentzh: what revdiablo said

[03:44] <geoffb> sorry for the slow response

[03:45] <agentzh> geoffb: np :)

[03:45] * agentzh is happy.

[03:47] <agentzh> thanks for the help!

[03:48] *** justatheory joined
[03:48] <revdiablo> agentzh: No problemo. FWIW you can usually get pretty good shell help in #bash

[03:48] <agentzh> okay :)

[03:49] <geoffb> agentzh: A silly little trick for seeing how sh is going to mangle your args ... replace the program you intend to call off to with: perl -e 'print map ">$_<\n", @ARGV'

[03:49] <geoffb> So:

[03:49] <geoffb> nice -n5 perl -e 'print map ">$_<\n", @ARGV' "$@"

[03:49] <geoffb> ./test.sh "foo bar" bax

[03:49] <geoffb> >foo bar<

[03:49] <geoffb> >bax<

[03:49] <agentzh> cool

[03:50] <geoffb> With $* or $@ without quotes, the foo and bar end up on separate lines

[03:50] <agentzh> right

[03:50] <geoffb> (And "$*" gives just one line with everything together)

[03:55] <geoffb> ... and don't forget 'set -' to turn off 'set -x' when it's in the way.  Not a very obvious off-switch

[04:17] <agentzh> Juerd: smoking at 01:02:25 +0200 looks okay?

[04:18] <offby1> geoffb: wouldn't "set +x" turn off "set -x"?

[04:18] <offby1> and better: put the "set -x", and the stuff which you want it to affect, in parens, like so: (set -x; some_command; another command )

[04:19] <geoffb> offby1: suppose so.  As I mentioned before, my sh fu is rusty, so I only remember bits and pieces

[04:20] <geoffb> I find that within the first three lines of any sh script, I'm ripping at my eyeballs and reaching for Perl

[04:20] <offby1> I once had a shell script grow to a couple of screensful without morphing into perl.  I called in a naturalist from the American Museum of Natural History, and he wrote a paper about it.

[04:21] <offby1> Normally my threshold is about ten lines.

[04:21] <geoffb> My main use of shell is pipes and simple loops at the command line

[04:22] <geoffb> A friend of mind writes multi-thousand line apps in ksh.

[04:22] <offby1> to each they own.

[04:22] <pasteling> "evalbot_r15985" at 194.145.200.126 pasted "Pugs build failure" (355 lines, 20.3K) at http://sial.org/pbot/24296

[04:23] <offby1> in theory I'd love to write in scsh, but it just doesn't come up that much ... plus I've been in Windows-land most of my working life, so...

[04:23] <geoffb> We once raced to see who could implement a piece of functionality fastest -- him in ksh, or me in Perl.  We tied, even though his had twice as many lines.  And we both had exactly one bug -- the *same one*.

[04:24] <offby1> odd indeed.

[04:24] <offby1> I'd give you the award, since shorter code is worthwhile

[04:24] <offby1> unless it was really cryptic.

[04:24] <geoffb> I almost lost my tenuous grip on sanity when he should me his date and time manipulation libraries

[04:25] <geoffb> Nah, it was pretty clean.

[04:25] <geoffb> I'm pretty rigid about clean code most of the time.

[04:25] <geoffb> er, *when he showed me

[04:28] <agentzh> Oh, ext/Perl6-Perldoc/t/*.t all failed in the report. i think they are not Perl 6 at all.

[04:30] *** OwlEye joined
[04:33] <agentzh> diakopter: Perl6-Perldoc is in the wrong directory? ext/ is supposed to contain Perl *6* modules only.

[04:35] <agentzh> diakopter: the pugs smoking mechanism always tries to run these Perl 5 tests with ./pugs.

[10:23] <moritz> is anybody planning a PHP backend for perl6?

[10:24] <nothingmuch> unlikely

[10:24] <moritz> then all lame "PHP only" web hoster would be usefull again ;-)

[10:27] <nothingmuch> i suppose, but deployment of perl 6 code on xsuch hosts is probably many harvests away

[10:27] <nothingmuch> i mean, it's plausible as a long term goal, but I doubt anybody is really investing time in it right now

[10:29] <moritz> nothingmuch: I thought in terms of long term goals, yes ;-)

[10:30] <nothingmuch> ah

[10:30] <nothingmuch> i dunno then ;-)

[10:31] <nothingmuch> are you considering trying for that?

[10:31] *** avarab is now known as avar

[10:31] *** iblechbot joined
[10:31] <moritz> no

[10:32] <moritz> I'm not a good coder, I don't think I'm qualified to write any backend

[10:32] <moritz> and I'm constantly trying to improve, but it's still a long way

[10:32] *** geoffb joined
[10:35] <nothingmuch> you can try to write support code for the php side

[10:35] <nothingmuch> if you're interested that could be a nice practice project as well

[10:35] <nothingmuch> and who knows, it might be useful

[10:36] <nothingmuch> by support code I mean things like an object representing junctions

[10:36] <nothingmuch> or implementations of simple builtins

[10:36] <nothingmuch> kind of like the Perl6:: namespace on the CPAN

[10:36] <moritz> if I loved PHP that would be a nice idea ;-)

[10:37] <nothingmuch> ah, i see ;-)

[10:37] <nothingmuch> can't say i lbame you

[10:38] <moritz> ;-)

[10:43] *** kanru joined
[10:47] <avar> I wish conway's Perl6:: stuff would be more useful. Both the rules and perldoc modules work as a source filter on your program, which is fine if that's what you want but maybe you just want a rules API or a pod6 parser..

[10:47] <avar> Should be split up IMHO:)

[10:48] <Alias__> he has that problem often

[10:48] <Alias__> Hook::LexWrap is both lexical wrapping code, plus an additional weird syntax that only works in 5.8+

[10:48] <Alias__> I'd love to be able to use the same lexwrap code without the syntaxy stuff

[10:49] <Alias__> I sometimes wonder if Damian has ever learned any magic

[10:49] <Alias__> Because a lot of his code seems designed to support his talks in such a way as to always give him a Prestige

[10:50] <Alias__> Whether or not it would have been more structurally sound to split it up

[10:50] <avar> Ya, Perl6::Rules is a rules->p5 rx compiler which would be useful with a Parse::Yapp like interface, but then it's a source filter too for things like $1 => $0 

[10:51] <Alias__> I've been temped to rewrite Hook::LexWrap a few times, since he refuses to make it back-compatible

[10:53] <svnbot6> r15992 | franck++ | changes suggested by Darren_Duncan++

[10:54] <avar> But OTOH the Perl6:: namespace seems to pretty much only be source filters to boolt p6-ish stuff on p5

[10:54] *** esstone joined
[10:56] <Alias__> pretty muich

[10:57] <avar> Well Perl6::Perldoc::Parser has a /normal/ interface though

[11:05] <Alias__> I needs to

[11:05] <Alias__> Since I think it's getting used for real at some point
