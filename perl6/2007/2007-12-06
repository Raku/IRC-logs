[01:06] <Tene> So, Perl 6-ish way to get a "deep copy" of an arbitrary data structure?

[01:08] <TimToady> how "deep" is "deep"?

[01:09] <TimToady> do you care if it becomes immutable?

[01:09] <TimToady> do you care if any parts of it no longer refer to what they referred to before?

[01:09] <Tene> Do you have a variety of convenient options for the different answers?

[01:10] <TimToady> some bits of it are more convenient than others... :)

[01:10] <Tene> If it has to be done manually, I can work something out myself to do it however I like.

[01:11] <Tene> I'm curious about builtins and such.

[01:11] <Tene> Having trouble finding relevant hits on 'copy' and 'clone' in the specs.

[01:11] <TimToady> well, underlying all the "cmp" semantics is the assumption that there is some way to canonicalize, with various freeze/thaw associations

[01:11] <TimToady> so doubtless there's some way to get at that someday

[01:11] <TimToady> without perhaps going to the trouble of .freeze.thaw

[01:12] <TimToady> but I don't think we've named it

[01:12] *** tokuhirom left
[01:12] <TimToady> clone is likely to be "one level down", as in "clone this object but not what it refers to"

[01:12] <Tene> *nod*

[01:12] <TimToady> immutable objects, of course, there's no differece, just copy the reference3

[01:13] <TimToady> and let the GC sort it out later :)

[01:14] <TimToady> but basically, deep cloning is breaking all identity that isn't actual data...

[01:15] <TimToady> which is the essential difference in meaning between eqv and ===

[01:15] <TimToady> === is about identity, while eqv is about anti-identity

[01:15] <meppl> good night

[01:17] <cj> no, I'm wong that revision didn't work

[01:17] <TimToady> I oversimplify, of course, since cloning should maintain internal identity relationships

[01:18] <cj> TimToady: you familiar w/miniparrot?

[01:18] <TimToady> nope

[01:19] <TimToady> just as, if you freeze a tree of objects and then thaw it, you should get back the tree (only a different tree).

[01:19] <cj> d'oh.  I thought you were omniscient!

[01:19] <TimToady> still remembering my kiboizing days, are you?

[01:20] <cj> my dictionary doesn't even know what that means!

[01:21] <TimToady> I'll bet google can find "kiboize"

[15:48] <fglock> pmurias: yes, but we need to implement Closure first

[15:50] <pmurias> fglock: why is it hard?

[15:51] <pugs_svn> r19066 | fglock++ | [kp6-perl5] started make() implementation

[15:52] <fglock> you need to detect which variables are used in the block, and then do the Closure object with it's Scope

[15:53] <fglock> we need it for kp6-in-C, anyway

[15:54] <pmurias> i thought it $scope_level_3 = Scope.new(outer=>$scope_level_2); at the start of each block

[15:54] <pmurias> * it is

[15:56] <fglock> you need to create the Scope when you instantiate the Code object, well before .APPLY is called

[18:15] <obra> fglock: are you going to fosdem?

[18:16] <fglock> obra: have a link?

[18:16] <obra> fosdem.org

[18:16] <obra> pmichaud is going.

[18:16] <fglock> cool - looking

[18:16] <obra> he could potentially meet up for a hackathon with you elsewhere around that time too

[18:16] *** Jedai joined
[18:17] <obra> but it seems like now that p6/parrot is largely being written in nqp (with only a tiny bit of calling out to P*), there will be more opportunity than ever to collaborate.

[18:17] <obra> and, well, having two competing implementations of perl6 in perl 6 is kind of crazy ;)

[18:17] * [particle] is currently converting punie to nqp-based

[18:18] *** Southen_ left
[18:18] <obra> [particle]: EXCELLENT

[18:18] <obra> [particle]: is there a branch I can svn up to wathc progress?

[18:18] *** test joined
[18:18] <[particle]> sure, http://svn.perl.org/parrot/branches/punie-devel

[18:18] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 23543: /branches/punie-devel

[18:19] <fglock> the non-perl6 part of kp6 is getting smaller each day :)

[18:19] <[particle]> or you can subscribe to the svn commit rss feed

[18:19] <[particle]> fglock++

[18:19] <obra> fglock: very cool

[18:19] <fglock> obra: it's probably too late to get sponsoring, but I'll take a look

[18:19] <moritz_> logging is back, a few lines went to /dev/null, though

[18:20] <obra> fglock: pmichaud said he can change flights if nessecary

[18:20] <fglock> obra: kp6-bootstrapped is now working on perl5 regexes, which should be quite faster

[18:20] <obra> very nice

[18:20] *** justatheory left
[18:20] <fglock> a hackathon in Lisbon would be great :)

[18:20] *** chris2 joined
[18:21] *** justatheory joined
[18:21] <obra> I'll be sure to mention it

[18:21] <obra> [particle]: you branch all of parrot for work on one language dir?

[18:21] <[particle]> no, i branched parrot, then svn switch inside languages/punie

[18:22] <[particle]> it's possible, however unlikely, that i'll need to modify the compiler toolkit, so i'd rather be safe and branch the whole repo

[18:23] <[particle]> so, to watch, you can cd languages/punie && svn switch http://svn.perl.org/parrot/branches/punie-devel/languages/punie

[18:28] <moritz_> hi dlocaus 

[18:31] <dlocaus> my hard drive is still out, it got "imaged" 99% yesterday, and I'll find out sometime between 3-4 today if there are any results...

[18:32] <dlocaus> is there anything you guys want documented & reformated?

[18:32] <moritz_> good luck!

[18:32] <dlocaus> moritz_: :), yes... I hope so.

[18:33] *** amnesiac joined
[18:33] <dlocaus> I'm thinking about getting an rsync.net account.  But, G-Storable (google drives) may be coming out soon.

[18:33] *** Aankhen`` joined
[18:35] <fglock> obra: i sent a note to $boss - let's see 

[18:35] <dlocaus> fglock: is there anything that would be worht documenting?

[18:35] <obra> fglock: excellent.

[18:36] <obra> dlocaus: maybe a new tutorial?

[18:36] <dlocaus> fglock: my (linux) harddrive is still out for repairs 

[18:36] <dlocaus> obra: a tutorial containing what?

[18:36] <obra> or improving the current "intro to kp6" docs?

[18:36] <obra> "how to get it running and start improving it" is my usual hobby horse ;)

[18:37] <dlocaus> obra: humm, well, some of kp6 will be going by the way side once onion gets going.

[18:37] <dlocaus> obra: and I've been a bit heistant about getting it to run and everything, because I don't have a linux box (something to run make against) to test what I write against what works :)

[18:38] <[particle]> see feather.

[18:38] *** ebassi left
[18:39] <dlocaus> obra: I've begun a beginners guide containning some of the stuff I've run into...

[18:39] <dlocaus> http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/beginners-guide.html

[18:39] <lambdabot> Title: /v6/v6-KindaPerl6/docs/beginners-guide.html - Pugs - Trac, http://tinyurl.com/392x43

[18:39] <fglock> dlocaus: re compilation language,

[18:39] <fglock> the files in Runtime/Perl6/ are compiled by kp6 itself,

[18:39] <fglock> all other Perl 6 files are currently compiled by mp6

[18:39] <fglock> "bootstrapping" means we will be able to compile those files with kp6 too

[18:40] <dlocaus> fglock: pmuaris said the same thing too, but I remember that "make forcerecompile" compiled some files around that area.

[18:40] <dlocaus> and make used mp6.pl to do it.

[18:40] <dlocaus> I've added it to my local todo list to check it out once I get my linux box up and going

[18:40] *** TJCRI joined
[18:41] * dlocaus stupid harddrive.  - cries.

[18:41] *** ludan left
[18:41] <Lorn> fglock: kp6 works fine, and i dont need to install any cpan module :) 

[18:41] <Lorn> t/kp6/ its cool too 

[18:43] <fglock> script/kp6 is used for Runtime/Perl6/*, and mp6 is used elsewhere

[18:43] <fglock> the KP6-BOOT target uses script/kp6 for everything

[18:47] <pugs_svn> r19077 | dlo++ | [kp6] updated documentation.  Mostly clarification and minor corrections.

[18:54] <fglock> Lorn: :)

[19:03] <pugs_svn> r19078 | fglock++ | [kp6-kp6] added debugging info for failing test

[19:06] <pugs_svn> r19079 | dlo++ | [kp6] Cleaned up formatting.

[19:07] <pugs_svn> r19080 | dlo++ | [kp6] always just one more little change...

[19:08] <dlocaus> @seen dlo

[19:08] <lambdabot> I haven't seen dlo.

[19:14] <fglock> dlo is away, he had a hardware problem

[19:14] <[particle]> :)

[19:15] <dlocaus>  :)

[19:15] <dlocaus> I've still got my trusty windows box :)

[19:15] <dlocaus> obra: is there an existing guide for "kp6" that I should update?

[19:15] <[particle]> yes, compared to the software, that hardware is *stable*

[19:16] * moritz_ cursed his hardware again and again in the last few weeks

[19:16] <moritz_> is there nothing better to run software on?

[19:16] <moritz_> something that's cheep and works?

[19:16] <dlocaus> your brain... it runs on carrots!

[19:17] <moritz_> dlocaus: but that's no Von Neumann architecture

[19:17] <dlocaus> has an active life cycle of 75 years, 85 if you treat it right.

[19:17] <obra> dlocaus: I'm sadly not the right person to answer that :/

[19:17] <dlocaus> obra: humm ok.

[19:17] <obra> I know that fglock has blogged an intro before to the pugs blog

[19:17] <obra> it may make sense to grab that, commit and update it

[19:18] <dlocaus> obra: do you know where it is?

[19:18] * fglock scratches head

[19:19] <moritz_> if there is one, you can find it here: http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/

[19:23] <dlocaus> moritz_: I think fglock's intro has passed into the /dev/null.

[19:23] <moritz_> if there ever was one

[19:24] <fglock> I think the most early doc is docs/ANNOUNCE

[19:26] <fglock> and the less readable docs/kindaperl6-spec.pod

[19:27] <pugs_svn> r19082 | dlo++ | [kp6] minor update, perl 5.10rc2 works with kp6.

[19:40] <dlocaus> doesn't quite seam to be the right place for it

[19:41] <[particle]> why not something like docs/beginners_guide.pod ??

[19:41] <dlocaus> [particle]: html gives me a lot more formating control

[19:41] <fglock> i'm ok

[19:41] <dlocaus> fglock: ?

[19:41] <[particle]> ah, well .html, then :)

[19:42] <fglock> please do

[19:42] <dlocaus> fglock: ok

[19:42] <dlocaus> fglock: do you want me to change FAQ.pod into FAQ.html?

[19:42] <fglock> sure

[19:42] <moritz_> dlocaus: I think there's no need

[19:42] <moritz_> you can use pod2html or something if you want html

[19:43] <fglock> and you can use a css for formatting

[19:43] <dlocaus> pod2html supports css?

[19:44] <dlocaus> ah, not in the manner I want.

[19:44] <dlocaus> /I want/I was thinking of/

[19:45] <dlocaus> moritz_: why do you perfer pod over html?

[19:47] <moritz_> dlocaus: it's better suited for documentation, I guess

[19:47] <moritz_> dlocaus: it's less overhead, and has everything you need

[19:48] <dlocaus> humm, well, I'll convert FAQ.pod into pod format, and then see how it lokos

[20:25] <pugs_svn> r19086 | dlo++ | [kp6] First pass.  Converted the text documentation (a brain dump) into Perl POD format.  I have also cleaned up the wording.

[20:28] <Lorn> lichtkind: test the tests :P
