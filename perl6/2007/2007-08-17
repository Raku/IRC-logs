[14:41] <sdffdssdf> how do we do it :(

[14:43] <diakopter> sdffdssdf: this is the perl6 channel

[14:45] <masak> sdffdssdf: also, swearing might seem an appropriate way to blow off steam at the moment, but it can be a definite turn-off for a reader trying to help you

[14:45] <masak> (it was to me)

[14:46] <masak> sdffdssdf: I think you need to read "perldoc -f open"

[14:48] <sdffdssdf> I did

[14:48] <sdffdssdf> Here what i tried

[14:49] <Tene> sdffdssdf: We can show you the Perl 6 way to do things, if you'd like, but for Perl 5 you're better off asking in #perl

[14:50] <masak> yes. I don't know a solution offhand. all I know is I also had trouble using '>' and '>>' inside &system calls

[14:51] <masak> sdffdssdf: that doesn't change the fact that this is the wrong channel

[19:11] <masak> I got curious about that unicode thing in svnbot

[19:11] <masak> maybe ingy (Net::IRC's author) would know more about where the problem lies

[19:12] <masak> I looked at the code, and found no obvious place where encoding would be an issue

[19:12] <masak> from what I can see, svnbot just sends along what it gets

[19:14] <masak> kjwcode: yes, see http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/out.pl?channel=perl6

[19:14] <lambdabot> Title: IRC log for #perl6, 2007-08-17

[19:14] <masak> 17:02

[19:15] <masak> ah, http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/out.pl?channel=perl6#i_83951

[19:15] <lambdabot> Title: IRC log for #perl6, 2007-08-17

[19:15] <kjwcode> Thanks for the pointer.  It made me do a double-take when I was reviewing the logs, too.

[19:16] <masak> kjwcode: we should find out what happened! the future of perl 6 is at stake!

[19:16] <masak> :)

[19:16] * kjwcode laughs.

[19:17] <masak> no, really. it is. if we fix this, the world will have no encoding problems, ever.

[19:17] <kjwcode> It's true, I do need to find something to do while every evil X11 dependency of GHC builds from the FreeBSD ports tree.

[19:18] <masak> and I should probably sleep now, but this sounds like fun

[19:19] <masak> problem is, it seems a bit hard to test

[19:19] <masak> sure, we could feed things through commit logs until we locate the error

[19:19] <masak> but what I really would like is a testing ground that was sure to reproduce the error, but without the svn logs/IRC dependency

[19:20] <masak> maybe that's too much to ask

[19:20] <kjwcode> Shouldn't be hard to set up another svnbot on another channel.  Of course, I haven't actually *looked* at it.  :)

[19:20] <masak> kjwcode: do you have feather access?

[19:20] <kjwcode> masak: I do, at least in theory -- I haven't used it yet.

[19:20] <kjwcode> I'm a little new.

[19:20] <masak> good. now, use it.

[19:21] <masak> we need to set up svnbot in a new channel where we don't disturb anyone

[19:21] <kjwcode> I'll have to see what kind of time I have on the weekend -- $work is calling for my attention right now, unfortunately.

[19:22] <masak> ok

[19:22] <masak> then I might actually get that piece of sleep after all
