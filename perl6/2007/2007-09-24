[13:50] <fglock> ahmadz: hi

[13:52] <ahmadz> i was wondering what needs to be done on kp6... since i finished runpugs ;-)

[13:52] *** drrho left
[13:52] *** cmarcelo joined
[13:53] <fglock> ahmadz: there are several subprojects, 

[13:54] <fglock> internal architecture; bootstrap; grammar rewrite; backends

[13:55] <fglock> and more; depends on what is fun for you

[13:55] <ahmadz> where can i help most? ;-)

[13:56] *** cmarcelo left
[13:56] *** cmarcelo joined
[13:56] <fglock> you can start by reading the few documents about kp6 and getting some knowledge of the source code

[13:57] <ahmadz> v6/docs/* right?

[13:57] <fglock> yes

[13:57] <ahmadz> i was talking with avar yesterday and it seems that the parrot backend is broken atm

[13:58] <fglock> that's a cool thing to do

[13:58] <ahmadz> i can work on it and then start working on a jvm/groovy version of it

[13:58] *** masak joined
[13:59] <ahmadz> ok then so EmitParrot.pm it is for now ;-)

[14:49] <ahmadz> cool i used his slides on runpugs ;-)

[14:49] <ahmadz> so from what i understand so far, i edit v6\v6-KindaPerl6\lib\KindaPerl6\Visitor\EmitParrot.pm

[14:49] <pugs_svnbot> r18150 | fglock++ | [kp6-parrot] CompUnit.attributes is unused

[14:49] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 18150 - Pugs - Trac

[14:50] <ahmadz> and i do 'perl Makefile.PL; make' and svn commit back right?

[14:50] <ahmadz> after testing the change with: 'perl kp6-mp6-perl5.pl --parrot < hello.pl'

[14:50] <fglock> yes

[14:51] <ahmadz> cool im getting somewhere then ;-)

[14:52] <ahmadz> but quick question: why are other files changed like Perl.pm, Traverse.pm, Term.pm and MetaClass.pm?

[14:53] <ahmadz> we need to commit all of them after 'perl Makefile.Pl; make' right or just emittparrot.pm?

[14:54] <fglock> they shouldn't be changed, maybe some interaction between svn and make and timestamps

[14:54] <ahmadz> im using feather1

[14:54] <fglock> just EmitParrot

[14:56] <fglock> sometimes i just do "svk revert -R *" after make, but that's silly

[14:56] <ahmadz> oh well there goes my commit, you fixed it ;-)

[14:57] <ahmadz> anyway, it seems emittparrot.pm does not do anything useful at the moment

[14:58] <fglock> see also v6/v6-MiniPerl6/lib/MiniPerl6/Parrot/Emitter.pm  # old version

[14:59] <ahmadz> ok i see, will work on it in 2 hours ;-)
