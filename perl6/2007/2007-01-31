[01:08] <putter> Hmm.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs  says "Due to licensing and concerns about the lack of copyright assignments from contributors, it is unlikely that The Perl Foundation will bless Pugs as the official implementation of Perl 6."

[01:09] <putter> It was added in early Nov by anon.

[01:12] <putter> Does this strike anyone else as bogus?  Ie, if they meant the haskell implementation, it seems to underestimate how much of the codebase will be churned before xmas, and overestimate the number of people who have made substantial contributions.  Either of which would mitigate the concern expressed.

[01:45] <TimToady> that's funny, considering S01 specifies that we not consider any implementation "the official Perl 6 implementation".  An implementation can be "an official implementation" if it passes the test suite.

[01:47] <dduncan> TimToady, regarding r13553, I suggest you reformat that cascaded conditional example so that the !! is on the leading end of lines rather than the trailing end

[01:47] <dduncan> and they line up vertically with the assignment

[01:49] <dduncan> I refer to the example under: +A tabular form is also popular for cascaded conditionals:

[01:49] <TimToady> gonna sic Perl::Critic on me?  :)

[01:49] <dduncan> I noticed it myself, without the help of a program

[01:49] <dduncan> and I agree with the rationale of the change

[01:49] <TimToady> I don't always follow PBC myself... :)

[01:50] <dduncan> but was your choice here arbitrary, or did you have the trailing !! on purpose?

[01:51] <TimToady> I just threw the pieces of gold into the fire, and lo! out came this Golden Calf...

[01:52] <putter> re "official"/"that's funny": correcting...

[01:53] <TimToady> I probably shouldn't be putting stylistic notes into the S's in any event.

[01:54] <dduncan> but the examples could still be consistent with PBP if you don't oppose them

[01:54] <dduncan> leading by example isn't leading by doctrine

[01:56] <SamB> TimToady: that is the lamest excuse evar!

[01:57] <SamB> it was lame the first time, and it is really really lame this time!

[01:59] <putter> Hmm,  S01 was probably not written in the month of "Nob".  No, I cant say that.  It does seem likely to be a typo however.

[02:01] <TimToady> SamB: so break the stone tablets again. :)

[02:02] <SamB> do I look like my face glows?

[02:02] <SamB> no!

[02:20] <putter> "flintstones, meet the..."

[02:37] <putter> in p6 rules, can <{ }> interpolated regexs be modifiers?  eg  /<{/:i/}> GoOd ThInG ThAt InTeRpOlAtEd/ ?

[02:38] <TimToady> sure, but they're scoped to the subrule, which doesn't do you much good.

[02:38] <putter> ah, ok

[02:39] <TimToady> making pretty good progress on the Official Grammar, btw

[02:39] <putter> :)

[02:39] <TimToady> to keep "actions" from cluttering things, I'm writing the rules such that they can be preprocessed

[02:40] <putter> good choice :)

[02:40] <TimToady> so we have rules like:

[02:40] <TimToady>     when    => rule { <block> {*} },                    #ACT sc when

[02:41] <TimToady> the {*} is a placeholder where you might want an action

[02:41] <TimToady> and #ACT sc when is the identifier of that action

[02:41] <TimToady> in this case "statement_control when"

[02:42] <putter> ah.  I can live with that.  hopefully nothing with have two actions?

[02:42] <TimToady> the hope is that the grammar can be used as-is for mere syntax validation, but preprocessed into various derivative grammars for other purposes

[02:42] <putter> yes

[02:43] <TimToady> nothing says the preprocess couldn't s/<'{*}'>/{...} {...}/

[02:43] <TimToady> looked at various ways of sneaking the identifier into the rule, but it really cluttered things up.

[02:44] <putter> <action 42> ?

[02:44] <TimToady> prefer symbolic

[02:44] *** dmq joined
[02:45] <putter> <action-42> ....  rule action-42 { <null> }  ?

[02:45] <TimToady> also it doesn't look like a longest-token stopper

[02:45] <TimToady> and {*} looks like a closure because it is one

[02:45] <TimToady> just doesn't do much.

[02:46] <TimToady> so you really only have to translate the ones that you want to add an action to.

[02:48] <putter> hmm, do we have a way to "inline" a subrule?  eg,   gram Acts does Base { rule when { <inline Base::when> {random cruft} }

[02:49] <TimToady> well, there's always eval...

[02:49] <putter> I suppose inline'ing is merely bonus.  could just   rule when { <Base::when> {somewhat different code} }

[02:49] <pasteling> "TimToady" at 71.139.17.198 pasted "Top of the grammar to ya!" (181 lines, 6.4K) at http://sial.org/pbot/22748

[02:50] <putter> oooo, looking...

[02:50] <TimToady> there's probably some form of textual macroing, but it could *really* screw up the visual semantics of which field is $3

[02:51] <TimToady> now all I need is define all my terms.

[02:53] <putter> chuckle

[02:53] <TimToady> oh, the ' ' key in a magic hash tells it what to check for between the key and the value.

[02:54] <putter> hmm, one thing I've never understood about token... actually a couple of things....

[02:54] <TimToady> so it's easy to force word boundaries there, for instance

[02:54] <putter> is the non-backtracking here needed for a correct parse, or merely efficiency?

[02:56] <TimToady> not sure.  there may be other things that token implies that regex wouldn't.

[02:56] <TimToady> for a while was considering that token/rule implied longest token on | while regex didn't, but decided consistency was better

[02:57] <putter> so is there any reason all those tokens could be rules instead?

[02:57] <TimToady> but mostly it's "token" to keep reminding you that it doesn't do whitespace like "rule".

[02:58] <putter> ah

[02:58] <TimToady> tokens don't do :sigspace

[02:59] <TimToady> though "token { \{ <expression> \} }" automatically gets whitespace inside because <expression> is a rule

[02:59] <TimToady> presumably with auto-ws fore and aft

[02:59] *** justatheory joined
[02:59] <putter> so when users locally modify the p6 grammar, they have a fighting chance against backtracking rules, but if they run afoul of a token, they lose?

[03:00] <TimToady> we try to push as many tokens into hashes as possible to keep them officially independent.

[03:00] <TimToady> and deletable as well as addable

[06:20] <TimToady> @tell putter backtracking vs not doesn't have anything much to do with mutability, nor does token vs rule.  rules don't backtrack by default either.

[06:20] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[06:21] <TimToady> @tell putter we're not changing the grammar out from under ourselves in any case.  we're only changing the grammar to parse the rest of the block.

[06:21] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[06:22] <TimToady> @tell putter it's sort of a continuation idea.  But yes, how one actually does the overrides is the real question.  The problem with the hash approach is it tempts us to reinvent inheritance badly.

[06:22] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[06:25] <TimToady> @tell putter and the old <%foo|%bar> notation is really a form of MI.  even the new /%foo|%bar/ is still kinda MIish.  anyway, will think on this derivation mechanism s'more.
