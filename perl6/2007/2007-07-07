[00:06] <beppu> I haven't seen audreyt in a while.  Is she alright?

[00:07] <diakopter> health problems :[ 

[00:08] <TimToady> ramifications of her liver problems earlier this year

[00:08] <TimToady> she'll be back eventually, but just needs time

[00:09] <beppu> That's too bad.  Hope she's feeling better.

[00:09] <thoughtpolice> what exactly happened? i knew she was sick, but aside from that, not much

[00:09] <diakopter> a long recovery (and still more weeks/months, likely)

[00:12] <thoughtpolice> what a bummer. :(

[00:12] <TimToady> well, basically, her ADHD meds were keeping her liver from recovering from the liver inflamation, so she had to go off them, and it takes time to get over the bounce back effects.

[00:12] <TimToady> it'll just take time, mostly.

[00:14] <TimToady> and it still fits in with the Perl 6 timeline of letting it take however long it takes to get to Christmas.  :)

[00:15] <[particle]> (open source project planning)++

[00:18] <TimToady> so if she wants to start easing back into doing some things, we should be careful to let her do them without expecting any more than that.  We all have to learn to pace ourselves as we get older...

[00:18] <TimToady> I know I've had to learn that several times by now.

[01:19] <thoughtpolice> i was about to say 'baysian filtering'

[01:19] <thoughtpolice> but i don't know too much about it :/

[01:20] <SamB> well it apparantly isn't very complicated

[01:20] <TimToady> we'd have to gather a large corpos of data, alas.

[01:20] <SamB> the tricky part is how to train it

[01:20] <TimToady> *corpus

[01:20] <TimToady> so we invite all the spammers to a Spam Day

[01:20] <SamB> today?

[01:20] <SamB> yesterday?

[01:20] <SamB> last week?

[01:20] <diakopter> heh

[01:21] <TimToady> I don't know if you can invite someone retroactively...

[01:21] <SamB> what I mean is we already have a fair amount of spam

[01:22] <thoughtpolice> i think i have a lot of the logs since the GOUDATR0N-thing started, but it probably wouldn't be enough if we wanted to tackle filtering all these guys out

[01:22] <thoughtpolice> why don't we just filter on GOUDATR0N? i'm pretty sure nobody other than those bots care about him.

[01:23] <SamB> another clue would be if there are multiple entities saying the same thing

[01:25] <diakopter> k, so Text::LevenshteinXS distance from GOUDATR0N and other baddy phrases, some magic ratio of Text::LevenshteinXS distance (from other recent messages) and message lengths... what else?

[01:25] <thoughtpolice> oh, be sure to add in GREATER PHP ALLIANCE

[01:25] <SamB> ratio of capital/lowercase letters

[01:25] <Juerd> /great/ && /php/ ought to suffice :P

[01:26] <TimToady> I suspect bayes would notice GPA itself

[01:26] <SamB> that's true

[01:26] <rhr> consecutive lines with a small edit distance between them would be a good clue

[02:18] <avar> Needing a seperate control language for templates is really just showing the limitation of perl there..

[02:19] <SamB> well I think it's rather normal, personally

[02:19] <avar> TimToady: Have you thought about Perl 6 in applications where custom template languages are used now? Should be pretty easy to use a sane subset with the compiler in perl6 or/and the rules for parsing the syntax avalible as a library

[02:19] <diakopter> outside-in..inside-out..back-to-outside-in..what-comes-next?

[02:19] <SamB> the other option is to use a different syntax for XML...

[02:20] <avar> SamB: Or to mix code and templates as Lisp does because there data is code 

[02:20] <TimToady> yes, though as with many things, I've only thought enough about it to keep P6 within shouting distance.  others will write the actual grammars

[02:21] <Limbic_Region> avar - I am good now - thanks

[02:21] <diakopter> avar: Template::Declare shows immense flexibility, on the other hand... there, data *are* code

[02:21] <SamB> avar: um. s-expressions aren't XML's native syntax either

[03:51] <Alias_> Plus some of the Perl 5 stuff was hard to just plain ignore

[03:54] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/16863

[03:54] <avar> presumamby you could use p6 syntax for that if you used a slightly altered grammar for a for statement and variables 

[03:54] <Alias_> Well... some of the main problems are fairly tricky

[03:55] <Alias_> For example, you can't use anything that triggers code at compile-time

[03:55] <Alias_> So no use, no BEGIN blocks

[03:55] <Alias_> Because the code can modify the grammar

[03:55] <Alias_> etc etc

[03:55] <avar> indeed

[03:55] <Alias_> A cheat would be to make the grammar read-only, but you'd need to execute code in order to see if any of that code tried to modify the grammar :)

[03:56] <TimToady> it would be pretty easy to knock out those rules in the grammar; supplying some of the missing functionality would be more problematic

[03:56] <Alias_> indeed

[03:56] <TimToady> though strict is default, fortunately

[03:56] <Alias_> ya

[03:56] <Alias_> Really, I think you need to just accept limited functionality

[03:56] <TimToady> could probably use an approved list of "uses" that don't change grammar

[03:57] <Alias_> Proving they could never modify the grammar is hard though

[03:57] <TimToady> hard to be extensible without being extensible though

[03:57] <Alias_> You just wouldn't be extensible

[03:57] <Alias_> Simple :)

[03:58] <TimToady> does that include not linking in new function calls?

[03:58] <Alias_> uh... we still have the foo bar, baz problem?

[03:58] <Alias_> ugh

[03:59] <Alias_> Whether functions are linked or not should not be relevant for the grammar

[03:59] <TimToady> no, not really; a given construct is always parsed consistently; it would just fail if there weren't a function there to link to by the end of compilation

[03:59] <Alias_> Well, we're not compiling at all

[03:59] <TimToady> I think we were pretty careful about that.

[03:59] <Alias_> That's the point

[04:00] <Alias_> It's just a syntax grammar non-compiler things can use to validate that some piece of code is valid etc

[04:00] <Alias_> The whole document/code duality thing

[04:03] <TimToady> might be useful to be able to lock the current grammar down for the rest of the lexical scope or file

[04:03] <TimToady> just as a general facility

[04:03] <Alias_> quite possibly

[04:04] <Alias_> Making the grammar read-only probably has some use cases somewhere

[04:04] <TimToady> "use 100% pure Perl;"  :)

[04:10] <Alias_> TimToady, btw, maybe you can answer a p5 question

[04:10] <TimToady> don't know much about p5...

[04:10] <Alias_> I've been wondering about $^O and compile-time

[04:10] <Alias_> Is $^O generally assumed to be constant?

[04:11] <Alias_> That is, for all this $IS_VMS type variables scattered around that are evaluated at compile-time, would it be better to convert all or most of them to full-blown constants?

[04:12] <TimToady> hmm, well, doesn't do you much good unless you also inline it like constant subs

[04:12] <Alias_> right

[04:12] <TimToady> I'm not aware of any variable inlining of constants in p5

[04:13] <Alias_> I've been noticing a lot of $is_vms in core modules, and I was wondering if we could save a bunch of memory/cpu if we moved them all to constants

[04:13] <TimToady> but it's certainly a case where it's likely to remove large chunks of "useless" code

[04:13] <Alias_> or is_dos, or whatever

[04:13] <Alias_> right

[04:13] *** BinGOs joined
[04:14] <Alias_> So in general, the assumption that $^O will remain unchanged between compile and run-time is allowed?

[04:14] <Alias_> I'm kind of at the point where I suspect it's been made way too often to be reverted anyways though :)

[04:14] <Alias_> (if it's not allowed)

[04:15] <TimToady> BEGIN { my $x = $^O eq 'VMS'; eval "sub is_vms () { $x }" }

[04:15] <avar> $is_dos is often my $is_dos = $^0 =~ /win32|dos/i; or something like that

[04:15] <Alias_> ya

[04:16] <Alias_> Someone was musing about creating a master module for them

[04:16] <avar> is't this compile time resolvable already in perl6 with if ($?OS ~~ 'VMS') { pp }

[04:16] <avar> *isn't

[04:16] <Alias_> But I suspect we save far more optimising out the code compared to avoid the extra symbols

[04:16] <TimToady> anything $?ish should be considered compile-time constant

[04:16] <TimToady> that's basically what $? is for

[04:16] <Alias_> ya

[04:17] <avar> isn't it compile-time-introspective constant?

[04:17] <Alias_> Perl 6 is likely to be much clearer about compile vs run-time stuff in that way

[04:17] <TimToady> of course, just because $?OS ~~ 'VMS' doesn't mean that $*OS will

[04:17] * avar forgets the $? vars

[04:17] <Alias_> TimToady: Might be a good idea to mandate whether it's going to change though

[04:17] <TimToady> if the bytecode is sufficiently portable, could be compiled on VMS and run on MVS

[04:17] <Alias_> Because otherwise things get confusing very very quickly

[04:18] <TimToady> it's already specced that $?OS can vary from $*OS

[04:18] <Alias_> The only thing worse than having compile-time optimisation is 50% of people using it

[04:18] <Alias_> hmm

[04:18] <avar> you can assign to $^O in p5 so it's not inlineable

[04:18] <Alias_> hmm

[04:19] *** BinGOs joined
[04:19] <avar> resolvable at compile time I mean

[04:19] <Alias_> So really, $?OS is a bad code smell

[04:19] <TimToady> prolly

[04:19] <Alias_> So we should eliminate it?

[04:19] <Alias_> or something

[04:19] <TimToady> "unwarranted chumminess with the runtime..."

[04:19] <Alias_> The whole concept of $?OS varying from $*OS creates logically impossible guarentees

[04:20] <avar> Alias_: What you probably /really/ want to do is factor this all into some Config.pm like stuff:)

[04:20] <Alias_> It's a feature you can't use without creating bugs

[04:20] <avar> $?OS.is_posix

[04:20] <Alias_> Most uses relate to filesystems tbh

[04:20] <avar> say join $?OS.linesep, <a b c>;

[04:21] <Alias_> So... do things optimise away at the equivalent of BEGIN-time?

[04:21] <avar> or rather, /w 3

[04:21] <avar> eek

[04:21] <Alias_> Or do we need to keep code for every OS loaded in memory always?

[04:21] <avar> Alias_: if they're specced to be constant then they'll probably be

[04:21] <Alias_> Sounds bloaty to me

[04:21] <Alias_> But that makes no sense

[04:21] <Alias_> Variables that are both constant and not constant...

[04:22] <TimToady> in general, one wants to isolate os dependencies into their own files

[04:22] <Alias_> Ideally yes

[04:22] <avar> In general you don't really want to know what OS you're on most of the time

[04:22] <Alias_> Which means File::Spec-like structures all over the place

[04:22] <TimToady> and it would be *nice* if most of the public interface were OS-independent

[04:22] <Alias_> But that's even worse

[04:23] <Alias_> Because you wouldn't even have the file available at run-time

[04:23] <TimToady> which file?

[04:23] <Alias_> or rather, you need to bundle all dependencies for all platforms all the time

[04:23] <Alias_> I'm assuming by "file" you mean "module"

[04:23] <Alias_> File::Spec-like things

[04:23] *** ashleyb joined
[04:24] <Alias_> in fact, it might make platform-specific dependencies impossible

[04:24] <Alias_> hrm

[04:24] <TimToady> presumably one can compile for different targets if one really needs to

[04:24] <TimToady> but I confess I haven't thought much about cross-compilation yet

[04:24] <Alias_> Big difference between compiling for different targets and compiling for EVERY target

[04:25] <Alias_> If the $OS variable is both constant and variable...

[04:25] <Alias_> in fact, if it changes, how can it be constant

[04:25] <Alias_> cross-compilation is fine

[04:25] <Alias_> What freaks me out is when the OS changes after compile time

[04:25] <Alias_> And somehow is still expected to work...

[04:26] <Alias_> Which is what $?OS different to $*OS appears to suggest

[04:26] <TimToady> cross compilation in that view is just forcing $*OS to a constant at compile time, where that constant is different from $?OS

[04:27] <Alias_> wait, what is $?OS and what is $*OS

[04:27] <Alias_> $?OS is the operating system of the system doing the compilation?

[04:27] <TimToady> $?OS is the os the compiler is running on

[04:27] <TimToady> $*OS is the os the runtime is running on

[04:27] <Alias_> or WILL run on?

[04:27] <TimToady> if we take that view of cross-compilation as a constraint

[04:28] <TimToady> (on $*OS)

[04:28] <Alias_> I would suspect all compilation must be 

[04:28] <Alias_> Otherwise there's very few types of platform-specific compile-time optimisations that are possible

[04:28] <TimToady> not if you want write-once-run-anywhere, in which case you let $*OS flap in the breeze and compile everything in

[04:28] <Alias_> possibly none

[04:29] <Alias_> You mean compile-once, run anywhere

[04:29] *** BinGOs joined
[04:29] <TimToady> well, a JIT can optimize futher down the way

[04:29] <Alias_> Which is quite different

[04:29] <TimToady> *further

[04:29] <Alias_> My main concern at this point is that we'll end up with no ability to do platform-specific dependencies

[04:29] <Alias_> Logically at least

[04:30] <TimToady> as I say, most such dependencies should be off in a library anyway

[04:30] <diakopter> Alias_: what's wrong with having different distributions for different platforms? (sorry if this is a dumb question)

[04:31] <Alias_> No problem at all

[04:31] <TimToady> well, it does complicate the naming of modules

[04:31] <Alias_> But if $*OS is variable, it means you MUST have a distribution that supports all platforms

[04:32] <Alias_> It basically forbids platform-specific code

[04:32] <Alias_> At some point you need to be able to assume that the OS isn't going to change beneath you

[04:33] <Alias_> If you can NEVER assume that, we have trouble

[04:33] <Alias_> Because various code never compiles out

[04:33] <TimToady> nothing says $*OS has to be rw once INIT sets it

[04:33] <Alias_> TimToady: Can I suggest that it is extremely important that the point in time at which $*OS goes read-only be explicitly documented

[04:34] <Alias_> Because it has some big implications for modules

[04:34] <Alias_> Especially given platform-specific library dependencies

[04:34] <TimToady> for a few modules

[04:34] *** BinGOs joined
[04:34] <Alias_> Not once you factor in dependency recursion

[04:35] *** ashelyb_ joined
[04:35] <Alias_> It's that nasty OMGIBROKECPAN factor as Schwern describes it :)

[04:35] <Alias_> change one small thing and, via dependency recusion, 3000 distributions explode :)

[04:35] <Alias_> recursion

[04:36] <TimToady> in which case, we didn't have very good encapsulation...

[04:36] <Alias_> Some of the problem is impossibilities

[04:36] * diakopter heads off to refactor CPAN; bbl.

[04:37] <Alias_> File::HomeDir uses code on various platforms that is simply impossible to install or even compile except on one platform

[04:37] <TimToady> well, yes, like module Foo has never been ported to AmigaOS...

[04:38] <Alias_> File::HomeDir uses Win32::Registry on Win32... should I need to install that module on Unix, because I won't know which platform I'm on until run-time?

[04:38] <Alias_> :)

[04:38] <TimToady> that's why we need to keep track of OS dependencies as part of the long name, probably

[04:39] <Alias_> Anyways

[04:39] <Alias_> I'll shut up now

[04:40] <TimToady> I'm not so worried about the dead code problem; memory is getting cheap, but yes, distribution can be a pain if ambiguous.

[04:40] <Alias_> I'd just hate to have Perl 6 come along and not realise until it's too late that we can't write platform abstraction modules without breaking certain guarentees

[04:40] *** unobe is now known as unobe_away

[04:40] <Alias_> It's more about the dependencies than the memory

[04:40] <Alias_> I'd like to see something like File::HomeDir implemented in Perl 6

[04:41] <Alias_> It's one of the more pathological cases

[04:41] <TimToady> not familiar with that

[04:41] <Alias_> File::HomeDir->my_documents

[04:41] <Alias_> Returns the "my documents" folder on Win32, mac, linux, etc

[04:41] <Alias_> Uses Mac::Carbon code on Mac, the Win32 registry on windows, and theoretically the open desktop specification on linux

[04:42] <Alias_> It also compensates for the problem there $ENV{HOME} is safe to use in cross-platform code

[04:42] <Alias_> where

[04:42] <Alias_> er

[04:42] <Alias_> is NOT safe to use

[04:43] <TimToady> I think that's a good place for spreading out the polymorphism across OS-dependently-named modules

[04:43] <Alias_> How...

[04:43] <TimToady> multiple implementations can share the same API

[04:43] <Alias_> They already do

[04:43] <diakopter> ok, so HomeDir names a feature that is common so some targeted OSes.

[04:43] <Alias_> File::HomeDir is a front-end to File::HomeDir::Win32, File::HomeDir::Darwin etc

[04:44] <TimToady> but the OS names are all adhocly added to the name rather than being metadata.  *that's* the problem

[04:44] <TimToady> if it's metadata you can just not download the OS's you don't want

[04:44] <Alias_> huh:

[04:44] <Alias_> "want" ?

[04:45] *** unobe_away is now known as unobe

[04:45] <Alias_> I'm not sure I understand that

[04:45] <diakopter> so you're wanting to have a Module that *requires* the runtime OS provide a HomeDir-location, or *suggests*, or *can optionally be enhanced by* a HomeDir-location?

[04:45] <TimToady> if I'm downloading for Darwin, I can look at the Win32 morph and ignore it because I know it's for Win32

[04:45] <Alias_> who can...

[04:45] <TimToady> I can't do that if the OS is magically encoding in the module name in an ad hoc fashion

[04:46] <TimToady> here we have some modules that are ...::Win32

[04:46] <TimToady> and other modules that are Win32::...

[04:46] <diakopter> TimToady wants Makefiles and .spec files and Makefile.PLs to be one-in-the-same with the module namespace... 

[04:46] <TimToady> no consistency.

[04:46] <Alias_> Define an OS?

[04:47] <TimToady> well, it's a potentially treeish namespace under OS, I'll grant

[04:47] <TimToady> where different versions of OS may or may not be considered the same

[04:47] <Alias_> I tried to specify "os" in the PITA metadata and gave up

[04:47] <Alias_> I now specify it as a serialized Config

[04:48] * diakopter likes arbitrarily named modules

[04:48] <Alias_> Hell, define  Unix

[04:48] <TimToady> you can still have arbitrary names, silly.

[04:48] <Alias_> I'm not sure I understand the points here though

[04:48] <diakopter> right, I'm just saying, it's pretentious to call something "Finder" or "Explorer"

[04:48] <diakopter> or "Database"

[04:49] <Alias_> Because most of the time, the platform-specific code is 7 layers deep in module dependencies

[04:49] <Alias_> And the "user" as such has no idea about them

[04:49] <Alias_> So I'm not entirely sure what some of the uses of "I" mean :)

[04:50] <Alias_> The only way I've ever found to define platform is to not define platform

[04:50] <diakopter> I was agreeing with the point that Win32 doesn't belong in a module's 'proper' name

[04:50] <Alias_> It only exists in turing-complete form on a case by case basis

[04:50] <Alias_> Which is why Makefile.PL is Perl and why we'll never have an authorative META.yml

[04:50] <TimToady> I'm just saying we can do a much better job of giving modules long names (including identifying metadata) such that it's pretty easy to look at a module "long name" and determine whether you want it or not.

[04:50] <diakopter> oh

[04:51] <TimToady> diakopter: ah, I misunderstood you then.

[04:51] <Alias_> wait, "want"

[04:51] <diakopter> I thought you were saying it's impossible to encode enough data to transmit that info to the name's reader.

[04:51] <TimToady> including recursively want, even though you don't know you want it

[04:51] <Alias_> TimToady, can you define "you" and "want" please? :)

[04:51] <Alias_> It's impossibly to encode platforms into a list

[04:52] <Alias_> And thus into "names"

[04:52] <Alias_> Because so far as I'm aware, platforms are generally defined as a hash

[04:52] <TimToady> which is why our long names are potentially hierarchical now.

[04:52] <Alias_> %Config is the definition of the Perl platform currently

[04:52] <Alias_> $^O is a simplistic fudge that works for simple cases like filesystems most of the time

[04:53] <Alias_> The reason that module names are sporadic is because that's the only way that works

[04:53] <Alias_> File::HomeDir::Darwin was added because File::HomeDir::Unix wasn't quite good enough

[04:54] <Alias_> And the distinction was needed at that point, and was quite specifically only relevant for Darwin

[04:54] <Alias_> There's no need for File::Spec::Darwin as far as I'm aware

[04:54] <Alias_> Ditto, File::HomeDir::MacOS8

[04:55] <Alias_> Although that might actually be File::HomeDir::Mac or somethign atm

[04:55] <Alias_> Anyways

[04:55] <Alias_> I simply can't make people install dependencies for multiple versions

[04:56] <Alias_> Because the dependencies just don't install

[04:56] *** ashleyb joined
[04:56] <Alias_> So at some very well defined point in time, there needs to be a definition of "OS" that doesn't wiggle around and change

[04:56] <diakopter> Diskless::Wireless::Implantable::OpenSourceOnly::NonIntrospectable::ForUrduSpeakersOnly::UsesYsImplementationOfZsAlgorithm::RunsOnlyOnHondaProcessors::MadeBetween2020and2022::WrittenInPerl6::DocumentedInJapanese::APIInJapanese v0.3.7 uploaded to PAUSE

[04:57] <Alias_> right :)

[04:57] <Alias_> I'm even nervouse defining "platform" in PITA as a hash

[04:57] <Alias_> But at SOME point, you HAVE to make a static description, you can't leave it turing-complete

[04:57] <Alias_> Because the halting problem makes it essentially unknowable

[04:58] <TimToady> all I'm saying is that our spiffy extensible "use Foo:foo<a>:bar<b>:baz<c>" scheme can have as much specificity or genericity as we need going down the road.

[04:58] <Alias_> ok

[04:58] <TimToady> it's really a kind of big multi dispatch: "find me a module that's good enough"

[04:58] <Alias_> Just be wary of trying to solve the fundamentally unsolvable

[04:58] <TimToady> and if you can't, die

[04:59] <Alias_> Which is why every attempt to write a Perl parser failed

[04:59] <TimToady> I'm wary of imposing a fixed solution where the problem changes from year to year

[04:59] <Alias_> Well, then not dictating any method is a valid option

[04:59] <diakopter> Alias_: the solution to your problem is to further split releases/distributions

[04:59] <Alias_> use Foo:foo<a>:bar<b>:baz is what I'd call "fixed" :)

[05:00] <TimToady> anyway S11 discuss long names using version and naming authority, but I can see that os comes into it somewhere too (where os can also have a version and naming authority...)

[05:00] <Alias_> Either the module specification is complete or not

[05:00] <Alias_> We went through this in META.yml

[05:00] <Alias_> People wanted, and still want, OS keys in META.yml

[05:00] <diakopter> but as well cpu architecture and other variants?

[05:01] <Alias_> The problem is that if you start adding conditionals to a static specification, pretty soon you need extensibility, which means library support, and then you need loops, and sooner or later your static description format is turing-complete

[05:01] <Alias_> And at that point, you should really be using Perl anyways :)

[05:01] <TimToady> different uses can be pickier than others, and if a module/multi fails its constraints, you keep looking for something a little more generic

[05:02] <Alias_> I quite liked the authoraty part

[05:02] <Alias_> authority

[05:02] <TimToady> yes, we're mostly just trying to add what's obviously missing right now, but leave the door open for additional constraints on the long name

[05:02] <Alias_> Because that's a problem you can't solve in a complete fashion

[05:02] * diakopter proposes *not* encoding metadata in module's unique identifiers.

[05:02] <diakopter> modules'

[05:02] <Alias_> indeed

[05:03] <Alias_> TimToady: What's obviously missing in some cases has non-obvious pathological cases :)

[05:03] <TimToady> no, not all metadata, but it's very important that every piece of unique functionality have a unique indentity

[05:03] <diakopter> I mean, I don't see a problem with distributing tools for apt and yum and emerge that parse and explode the proper metadata for whatever searchable/filterable database.

[05:04] <TimToady> (modulo $^Oish tweaks)

[05:04] <Alias_> Well, that's fine, but you hit the limits of identification

[05:04] <diakopter> how much unique functionality will there be?

[05:04] <Alias_> Which assumes some metric exists by which something can be identified

[05:04] <Alias_> There's quite a large set of situations where no such metric exists

[05:04] <TimToady> perl has not survived this far by being worried about limit cases, but about common cases.

[05:05] * diakopter ponders

[05:05] <TimToady> first we do easy things should be easy

[05:05] <TimToady> later we worry about the impossible

[05:05] <Alias_> This is not one of those cases :)

[05:05] * diakopter chimes in "that doesn't mean that strategy will continue to be feasible"

[05:05] <diakopter> (sorry to troll so much)

[05:06] <TimToady> the world wide web exploded because they have a nice extensible way to name things.  Once the URL was invented, everything else just kinda happened.

[05:06] <Alias_> What I'd really hate to see is people making a dozen modules that just say "use the unix one"

[05:07] <TimToady> at some point the community steps in and refactors, that's all

[05:07] <diakopter> right, but that universal namespace already exists.

[05:07] <TimToady> and with the authorities, we can now do that

[05:07] <Alias_> Anyways

[05:08] <Alias_> When some comes up with a way to identify an operating system, I'll be all for os-naming in module names

[05:08] <Alias_> But so far as I can tell, it's not possible

[05:08] <diakopter> it's like putting a label on every permutation of %ENV

[05:08] <Alias_> not %ENV, %Config

[05:08] <Alias_> :)

[05:09] <TimToady> well, some subset of %Config is the identifying part, and some of it is noise.

[05:09] <Alias_> true

[05:09] <Alias_> But you'd be surprised how large the identifying part is

[05:09] <TimToady> Um, no.

[05:10] <TimToady> You forget who wrote Configure and metaconfig in the first place.

[05:10] <Alias_> Of course I don't :)

[05:10] <TimToady> I'm the one who originally argued for feature-based configuration and not OS based. :)

[05:10] <Alias_> And I think you were right then, and wrong now :)

[05:11] <TimToady> No, I was only somewhat right then, and only somewhat wrong now. :)

[05:11] <Alias_> For a relatively large value of somewhat 

[05:11] <TimToady> yeah, but you're in the Down Under, so you see the graph upside down

[05:11] <Alias_> I'm also standing upside down, so it appears right side up :)

[05:12] <Alias_> So the poison MUST be in the glass in front of me! :(

[05:12] <TimToady> well, anyway, I think it should be obvious to any casual listeners that we've thought about it a lot, and need to continue to think about it s'more.

[05:12] <Alias_> sure

[05:13] <Alias_> But as I said, be wary of leaving $OS variable for too long

[05:13] <Alias_> Currently $^O is constant at compile time purely by current code use

[05:13] <Alias_> "by popular assumption"

[05:13] <TimToady> well, we got pretty far with it.

[05:14] <Alias_> I'm quite fine having OS constant at compile time

[05:14] <Alias_> I prefer it actually

[05:14] <Alias_> But this time around, lets document it :)

[05:14] <TimToady> what do you mean by OS?  :)

[05:14] <Alias_> Rather than have it evolve :)

[05:14] <Alias_> exactly

[05:14] * diakopter notes that Perl N is deferring something to Perl N+1

[05:15] <TimToady> indeed, that is most of the design of Perl N, to do just that.

[05:15] <Alias_> Mostly, I see code that uses either the $^O archnames to derive filesystem path names

[05:15] <Alias_> And I also see some variation in dependencies depending on whether or not a compiler is available in the toolchain

[05:16] <Alias_> The variations on archname conditions is immense

[05:16] <Alias_> I've actually had to explain to people that MSWin32 doesn't mean "ActivePerl"

[05:16] <Alias_> Because they assumed Strawberry Perl would have a different $^O

[05:17] <Alias_> Anyways, hopefully I'll have CPAN 1.5 finished soon and I can turn my attention to CPAN 2

[05:17] <Alias_> And bitch some more :)

[05:17] <TimToady> looking forward that.  :)

[05:18] <TimToady> s:2nd/<ws>/ to /

[05:18] <Alias_> I think I have a good model in my head for P6 modules though

[05:18] <Alias_> in terms of "layers"

[05:18] <Alias_> But I need to dig into P6 more before I'm sure I'm right

[05:19] <TimToady> we're still honing the rough edges for a while yet, so feedback on P6 design is welcome.

[05:19] <Alias_> The model I have for CPAN1.5 seems viable as a general multi-language implementation of a source repository though

[05:20] <Alias_> Just got to get the last changes in and be sure it covers all cases

[05:20] <Alias_> configure_requires: is the big one

[05:20] <TimToady> eyes going crossed, so I should probably retire soon, having learned to pace myself several times already. :)

[05:20] <Alias_> :)

[07:30] <dduncan> just for that, I think Parrot should provide one-way functionality only, converting from PHP to other languages, and not the other way

[11:56] <pugs_svnbot> :     token idents { <ident>* }

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> :     rule blah { 'a'* <?ws>? <idents> }

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> :     grammar Bar;

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> :     regex hey { <alpha>**{2} }

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> : * implemented Pugs::Emitter::Grammar::Perl5 for emitting Perl 5 source

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> :   from grammar ASTs.

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> : * added t/04-compiler-grammar.t for testing P::C::Grammar.

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> : * updated MANIFEST accordingly.

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> :   with the improvements listed above, PCR's test suite has passed 7 more.

[11:57] <pugs_svnbot> : only 68 tests are failing now. yay!

[11:57] <agentzh> wow...

[11:57] <agentzh> smg: because audreyt loves haskell

[11:58] <smg> so

[11:58] <smg> perl6 will be implemented then all in haskell?

[11:58] <Alias_> perl6 will be in some ways inspired by the best parts of haskell

[11:58] <fglock__> agentzh: yay!

[11:58] <Alias_> And steal in much the same way it has stolen a lot from many other languages in the past

[11:59] <agentzh> fglock: i doesn't understand why "rule foo {...}" doesn't work regarding sigspace...but it doesn't work...

[11:59] <smg> eh

[11:59] <smg> but perl is implemented in C?

[11:59] <lidden> Eventully perl will likely be in perl 6 running on parrot

[12:00] <agentzh> oops, s/doesn't understand/don't understand/

[12:00] <fglock__> agentzh: sigspace is processed at the same place as the quantifiers, in the emitter

[12:00] <smg> i never did haskell

[12:00] <smg> but i know it's good

[12:00] <smg> but i don't want to learn haskell

[12:00] <smg> perl is implemented in C

[12:00] <smg> so perl6 will be implemented in Haskell

[12:01] <smg> You don't need parens on control structure conditions <-- good!

[12:01] <fglock__> I'd add some prints around that code

[12:01] <agentzh> fglock: *nod* i'll investigate it later. maybe a v6.pm bug...

[12:01] <agentzh> fglock__: the emitter works as expected...just v6.pm doesn't work that way...

[12:01] <smg> eval {} is now try {} <-- bad

[12:01] <smg> i inline C etc posible in perl6?

[12:01] <smg> so i use =begin end

[12:02] <lidden> renaming eval BLOCK is good

[12:02] <smg> =begin C ?

[12:02] <agentzh> fglock__: the next step: making compile_p6grammar use Pugs::Compiler::Grammar...

[12:02] <lidden> It takes away the confusion with eval STRING

[12:02] <smg> why?

[12:02] <smg> confusing??

[12:02] <smg> it's not confusing

[12:02] <agentzh> fglock__: and then i'll tweak Rule2.pm and feed it into compile_p6grammar instead of v6.pm :)

[12:03] <lidden> having eval do 2 very diffrent tings is confusing for some ppl

[12:05] <smg>     Was:    foreach my $x (@whatever) { ... }

[12:05] <smg>     Now:    for @whatever -> $x       { ... }

[12:05] <smg> this is more confusing i think

[12:06] <fglock__> agentzh: timtoady :)

[12:06] <agentzh> fglock__: right :)

[12:09] <agentzh> moritz: could you please not to trim the whitespaces in the logs? sometimes we need it...

[12:09] <smg> The :P5 modifier is there because the standard Perl6 syntax is rather different, and 'P5' notes a Perl5 compatibility syntax. For a substitution: <-- THAT is stupid

[12:09] <smg> sorry

[12:09] <agentzh> s/not to trim/not/

[12:09] <agentzh> sigh

[15:12] <aharoni> ok

[15:12] <TimToady> Personally I got frustrated with cygwin (probably too easily) and used strawberry

[15:13] <TimToady> but if you want to whack on it and make it work, a lot of folks would probably be grateful

[15:13] <aharoni> hmm, i couldn't make strawberry work the last time i tried. and cygwin provides a (rather) complete unix-like env

[15:13] <aharoni> there are a bunch of things that i'd like to try to fix myself

[15:14] <TimToady> mainly you have to be careful not to mix them up, I think, since the libraries are incompatible

[15:21] <agentzh> gb2312 is also known as "simplified chinese" :)

[15:23] <fglock__> TimToady: I'm lost about the scoping rules for $_ and $/ - where should I look in the synopsis?

[15:26] <TimToady> I don't think any synopsis discusses it in detail

[15:26] <TimToady> basically, every pad has its own $_ and $/

[15:27] <TimToady> an official Routine does not initialize the value of $_, so it starts undefined

[15:27] <TimToady> blocks without arguments assume the first argument is optional, and if supplied, binds $_ to it

[15:28] <TimToady> otherwise binds to OUTER::<$_> as default

[15:28] <fglock__> the specific problem is: I'm creating a method that represents a regex; how do I tell it to use the outer $_, and how do I return $/

[15:28] <TimToady> so the signature of a bare block is something like ($_ = OUTER::<$_>)

[15:29] <fglock__> ok, so $_ = OUTER::<$_> on entry, and maybe OUTER::<$/> = $/ on exit?

[15:29] <TimToady> maybe with an "is ref" or some such thrown in the middle so it stays rw

[15:29] <TimToady> don't think so

[15:30] <TimToady> p5 tends to dynamically scope the "current" match, though that is inaccessible directly

[15:31] <TimToady> so I don't think people will necessarily expect $/ to escape from a block

[15:32] <offby1> [particle]: helllp!  Spam on the seattleperl wiki!  You're an admin, so ... you're our only hope, Obi Wan Kenobi

[15:33] <fglock__> hmm - but $/ must escape from the regex-method (or not, or is it a special scope)

[15:33] *** hmisty joined
[15:34] <TimToady> pattern matchers look for $/ in their outer scope and alias it to their result

[15:34] <fglock__> ah - that works

[15:35] <fglock__> match to OUTER::<$_> and modify OUTER::<$/>, right?

[15:35] <TimToady> it's possible that the regex version of $/ should be named something different from lexical $/

[15:35] <TimToady> right now, we use the same name for two rather different things

[15:36] <TimToady> if we split them, then $/ would automatically mean the outer one in a closurely way

[15:36] <TimToady> and we wouldn't need to have a special rule about what $/ means

[15:40] <offby1> so where _is_ [particle] ?  He's usually around but has been absent the last couple days

[15:41] <TimToady> hmm, but if we split them, then the definition of $<foo> changes :/

[15:57] <aharoni> what do you mean by "uses"? it may be built with MinGW, but it is supposed to be possible to run it inside cygwin

[15:58] <TimToady> run it, but perhaps not link it to a cygwin compiled module

[15:58] <aharoni> bother

[15:58] <TimToady> depends on whether the file formats are compatible, I imagine

[15:58] <TimToady> you *might* be forced to compile ghc under cygwin  :(

[15:58] <TimToady> if someone hasn't done it already somewhere...

[15:59] <aharoni> either that or give up readline support for pugs

[15:59] <aharoni> which won't be fun

[15:59] <TimToady> but I'm just guessing--don't let me discourage you  :)

[15:59] <aharoni> oh no. i'm not discouraged

[16:05] <agentzh> i'm very close to the goal now. yay

[20:39] <avar> tell @agentzh I'm upgrading re::engines atm but I'll check out compile_p6grammar later, if it works it should be easy to write Grammar::*.pm in p5 with it and hook it into re::engine::PCR :)

[20:45] *** jedai joined

[20:52] <dduncan> question: is there any reason why the smoker config file, which is meant to be manually created and edited, is a hidden dot-file [.smoker.yml] rather than a visible file like config.yml is : [smoker.yml] ?

[20:52] *** teratoma is now known as drwxr-xr-x

[20:52] <dduncan> I'm inclined to make that change unless someone else wants to, or will explain why the current name is better

[20:52] *** drwxr-xr-x is now known as teratoma

[20:53] <dduncan> my reason for renaming it is to make it easier to migrate settings between multiple pugs checkout folders ... if the files are visible, one can just copy config.yml and smoker.yml in the gui

[20:54] <dduncan> fyi, I plan to make the change on my own system now, and if it results in a successful smoke, I'll commit that change

[20:56] <dduncan> or I think I'll further rename it to smoker_config.yml or config_smoker.yml, to make it stand out more from the generated smoke.yml

[21:00] *** vel joined
[21:00] <dduncan> s/smoke/smoker/

[21:01] <avar> It's probably because dot files are traditionally config files, some guis just hide them;/

[21:03] <dduncan> yes, but pugs main config is config.yml, and I don't like that inconsistency, not to mention the ease of use problem

[21:04] <dduncan> what would be better for a rename, smoker.yml for the least delta ... which is also more like debian/smoker.yml that exists now

[21:04] <dduncan> er, I'll just do that

[21:05] <dduncan> right now I'm just looking for what file refers to the old .smoker.yml name

[21:05] <dduncan> though I suppose if its a generic cpan module doing that, then I'm out of luck

[21:13] <dduncan> for this matter, there are already smoke config options in plain config.yml, such as smoke_concurrent ... could the contents of smoker.yml just go in there?

[21:14] <moritz> I suppose so ;)

[21:14] <avar> dduncan: It's probably good to change it, I was just pointing out that dot-files being "hidden" and not "eq config" isa relativly recent development:)

[21:15] <avar> well, then again not really, been in ls(1) from day one:)

[21:15] <dduncan> right now I'm trying to figure out how to do this though ... by looking for files that refer to ".smoker"

[21:15] <dduncan> no luck yet

[22:10] <dduncan> which ones?

[22:11] <dduncan> but fyi, I anticipate fast-tracking making the Perl 5 Muldis DB require 5.10 ... as far as that is reasonable without chopping its possible user base

[22:12] *** justatheory joined
[22:12] <dduncan> my rationale being I wanted to keep a simpler dependency list

[22:12] <avar> dduncan: re::engine::Plan9, re::engine::PCRE 

[22:12] <dduncan> not only does 5.10 (5.9.x) bundle some stuff I like, it bundles cpanplus, making it easier to install other things

[22:12] <dduncan> okay

[22:13] <avar> easier how?

[22:13] <dduncan> actually yes, if I can do regexps in 5.x like the 6.x ones, that would be nice

[22:14] <dduncan> or more generally, I'd like to make a simple Muldis D parser without some heavyweight dependency like Damian's parser

[22:14] <dduncan> after all, my grammar is very simple, so that should be reasonable

[22:15] <dduncan> afaik, cpanplus is easier to use than cpan.pm

[22:15] <dduncan> that's easier how

[22:15] <avar> CPAN.pm is easier in blead though, it asks you one question by default

[22:15] <avar> "do you want me to set up everything for you?"

[22:16] <fglock> avar: I've got examples/token-test.pl working

[22:16] <fglock> now I'm extending the compiler to support more primitives

[22:16] <fglock> (kp6)

[22:20] <fglock> dduncan: simple parser reminds me of miniperl6 ...

[22:21] <fglock> not sure how heavyweight it is

[22:24] <avar> @tell agentzh You need to check in PCR inc/Test/* stuff into svn, or all the inc/ stuff

[22:24] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[22:28] <avar> fglock: how does pcr understand stuff like:

[22:28] <avar>       token add {

[22:28] <avar>           (\d+) <?ws>? '+' <?ws>? (\d+) { return $/[0] + $/[1] }

[22:28] <avar>       }
