[00:01] <dduncan> TimToady, is pod like code comments, in that you should be able to put it on any new line and have it work (save for within multi-line quotes?

[00:02] <dduncan> I found before that Pugs was having trouble when pod is present, in places that it shouldn't be

[00:02] <dduncan> I'm assuming that wasn't part of the spec, but thought I would ask

[09:33] <agentz> it's audreyt's password, i think.

[09:33] <agentz> okay, i've successfully used my username.

[09:33] <agentz> never mind

[09:33] <clkao> oh i didn't get that far at all..

[10:18] <renormalist> Hi! I'm working on an article about Pugs/Perl6 for a german IT magazine. I want to describe the state of 6.28 release. Is someone already working on the ChangeLog file? If not, how is this typically created? Does someone read all svn log messages since last release and makes them prose?

[10:18] <lambdabot> renormalist: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[10:23] <renormalist> Maybe I can help writing some lines for the ChangeLog en passant. But I don't really know about the details that happened since 6.13. Therefore I ask who might want talk about it, who can give help or does need help.

[10:27] *** chris2 joined

[10:38] *** buetow joined
[10:46] <renormalist> moritz: k, thx, unfortunately audreyt seems to be needed for everything. I'm not sure I can take her time additionally to her lot of other stuff.

[10:46] <renormalist> Alias__: Do you mean me? No I didn't get a message. At least not from you. Only from audreyt.

[10:47] <Alias__> That's what I meant

[10:47] <Alias__> :)

[10:48] <renormalist> mkay :-)

[10:52] <agentz> renormalist: iirc, audreyt once said in the svn log that she needed 2 solid days to push pugs into the shape of 6.28.

[10:53] <agentz> renormalist: according to my experience, ChangeLog is normally prepared by working through the svn log.

[15:39] <jerrylee> thanks a lot, agentzh!

[15:40] <jerrylee> i guess so

[15:40] <agentzh> my pleasure ;)

[15:40] <agentzh> maybe you should fix your perl installation.

[16:22] <TimToady> good, that's supposed to be a syntax error

[16:22] <moritz> do method calls like <3 4 1>.join(";") always need the parenthesis?

[16:23] <TimToady> parens or colon

[16:23] <moritz> ok

[16:23] <moritz> and I don't want to write nonsense ;-)

[16:23] <TimToady> oops

[16:24] <TimToady> basically, colon turns a .method into a listop, and listops all require a space before the first arg.

[16:24] <TimToady> so this should error too:

[16:24] <TimToady> ?eval <3 4,1>.join:';'

[16:24] <evalbot_r15929> Error: ␤Unexpected ":';'"␤expecting term postfix or operator

[16:25] *** gnuvince joined
[16:25] <gaal> must the colon be flush with the method?

[16:25] <TimToady> but could probably give a more useful error message "you need a space there"

[16:25] <TimToady> yes, as must the () unless you use .()

[16:25] <TimToady> or .\  ()

[16:27] <moritz> TimToady: write a test case ;-)

[16:27] <TimToady> already did, the test is for pugs to parse STD.pm  :P

[16:27] <TimToady> (and run)

[16:27] <moritz> how far away are we from that?

[16:30] <TimToady> dunno, I can run it through "cheat" and get it to parse and start running, but I have no clue how close it is to actually working.

[16:30] <TimToady> and to be perfectly honest, there are likely a lot of bugs still

[16:30] <TimToady> including places where it should recognize "unspace".

[16:30] <TimToady> in fact, I don't think it recognizes unspace between .foo and : yet either

[16:31] <moritz> pugs or STD.pm?

[16:47] <moritz> I don't read p5p... is it because some filesystems are case-insensitive?
