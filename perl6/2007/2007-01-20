[01:27] <beppu_> Is there such a thing as run-time composition with Roles in Perl 6 land.  Moose seems to support this.

[01:27] *** avarab joined
[01:28] <wolverian> beppu_, yes indeed, see http://perlcabal.org/syn/S12.html#Roles

[01:28] <lambdabot> Title: S12

[01:29] <beppu_> cool.

[01:58] * Debolaz again gets annoyed by how roles are called "mixins" in certain other languages.

[02:00] <beppu_> Debolaz: what does "mixin" mean to you.  Is it a less precise term in your mind?

[23:12] <putter> Fyi -  I just now did cpan -i Task::Smoke on a relatively fresh v5.8.8, and got lots of test/install failures.

[23:13] <allbery_b> join the club :/

[23:15] <gaal> putter: nopaste?

[23:15] <lambdabot> gaal: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[23:15] <gaal> ah got the moosage, thanks

[23:16] *** GabrielVieira2 joined
[23:16] <gaal> oh, not related.

[23:17] <gaal> well, there is quite some rewrite

[23:17] <gaal> some of it isn't crazy hard, like for example switching over to using the existing new signature parser with function sigs

[23:18] <gaal> but the parser will need revisiting

[23:18] <gaal> probably harder is the other core parts that look at the constructed AST, since they are sometimes coupled with the old concrete structure

[23:19] <gaal> some things again shouldn't be very difficult: just transition over to new structure

[23:20] <gaal> some things are harder since they got really differnent representations. I don't grok the new way context is intuited, for example. (used to be it was an annotation wrapper on an Exp node)

[23:20] *** ofer0 is now known as ofer0_

[23:20] <gaal> likewise position, which is not an explicit part of the AST now

[23:21] <gaal> pragmas though should be easier once the new ast is used

[23:21] *** ofer0_ is now known as ofer0

[23:21] <gaal> putter: the key to transitioning rather than harmitmode singlehanded mass-commit is probably to transition through the "VV" node

[23:22] <gaal> Other than that, I think the new ast is articulated well enough, or almost well enough.

[23:23] <gaal> bedtime for me. good night!

[23:23] <gaal> zz&

[23:23] <gaal> (oh if someone could nopaste a task::smoke buildfail, or open an RT bug, or email me, that'd be great, thanks)
