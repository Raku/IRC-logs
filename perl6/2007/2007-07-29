[05:59] <obra> hey agentzh 

[05:59] <agentzh> obra: i've been pondering how difficult it would be to write a xul frontend for jifty these days...

[05:59] * obra is just getting ready for bed

[05:59] <obra> ooh. I'd love to see that

[05:59] <agentzh> obra: i may have a chance to work that out in $job_time

[06:00] <agentzh> obra: my manager loves xul as well as perl :)

[06:01] <agentzh> obra: the Template::Declare stuff that emits xul code has made him quite excited ;)

[06:01] <obra> very nice.

[06:01] <agentzh> sleep well, obra

[06:01] <agentzh> i'll post stuff to jifty-devel if the project starts :)

[06:02] <obra> I'd love to see TD refactored well enough to make T::D::XUL T::D::HTML as easy subclasses.

[06:02] <obra> with Template::Declare::Tags left only for compat ;)

[06:02] <obra> sounds good.

[06:02] <obra> I'll watch for posts or commits ;)

[06:02] <obra> have a good sunday

[06:02] <agentzh> obra: i'll take a close look at the TD tags stuff

[08:04] <moritz_> I convinced my boss to allow me perl hacking at $job ;)

[08:05] <masak> moritz_: moin

[08:05] <masak> woot

[08:05] <moritz_> now I'm converting CAD and CAE material data files to xml

[08:06] <moritz_> not exactly exiting, but much more intersting than doing it manually ;)

[08:08] *** agentzh joined
[08:11] <moritz_> is an html tag allowed to have multiple ids?

[08:13] <lumi> moritz_: How can a tag have multiple ids?

[08:13] <lumi> You mean, <tag id="foo" id="bar"> ? Then no

[08:13] <moritz_> <tr id="foo" id="bar>...</tr> I'd guess... I just don't know if it's allowed...

[08:13] <lumi> It isn't... Do you need it for CSS?

[08:14] <moritz_> lumi: thanks, that's sad :(

[08:14] <moritz_> lumi: no, for anchors...

[08:14] <lumi> Ah, can't help you then, sry

[08:14] <lumi> Try nesting

[08:14] <masak> moritz_: why do you need multiple ids?

[08:15] <moritz_>  in the irclogs, the anchors are currently based on the line number on that day, which changes if lines are marked as spam...

[08:15] <moritz_> and therefore I want to swith to id based anchors

[08:15] <lumi> Maybe switch it to database ID?

[08:15] <lumi> Oh, but you want the old links to work?

[08:15] <moritz_> lumi: exactly

[08:16] <lumi> Nesting <a> tags is the only thing I can think of

[08:16] <lumi> Or just putting them next to one another

[08:16] <lumi> <a id="foo"/><a id="bar"/>content

[08:16] <lumi> Er, ignore he XMLism

[08:17] <moritz_> why? it's xhtml 1.0 strict ;)

[08:17] <lumi> Well, don't ignore the XMLism, then :P

[08:18] <masak> I would avoid <a /> elements if I were you

[08:18] <moritz_> masak: and use <a></a> instead=

[08:18] <moritz_> s/=/?/

[08:18] <lumi> masak: Why?

[08:19] <masak> moritz_: no, just id attributes on other elements

[08:19] <masak> lumi: because id attributes are shorter to write and easier to understand

[08:19] <lumi> masak: What do you suggest for this case? id on <tr> and id on <td>?

[08:19] <moritz_> lumi: I'm doing just that right now ;)

[08:19] <masak> lumi: maybe. still a bit uneasy about having to divide it up like that

[08:20] <masak> why is backwards compatibility that important?

[08:20] <moritz_> masak: "Cool URLs don't change" ;)

[08:20] <masak> moritz_: true :)

[08:20] <lumi> The line <td>s are just backwards compat, so you can put them in the less correct location :P

[08:20] <lumi> Errrr

[08:20] <lumi> The line *anchors*

[08:21] <lumi> Although the line anchors are already incorrect, aren't they?

[08:21] <moritz_> lumi: in most cases they are correct

[08:22] <lumi> Alternately, you can have the line count consider dropped lines...

[08:22] <masak> lumi: that sounds even better

[08:22] <moritz_> lumi: using ids is simpler and cleaner on the long run

[08:22] <lumi> moritz_: I agree

[08:22] <masak> moritz_: you're right

[08:23] <Aankhen``> Why would you put two empty `a` elements next to each other?

[08:23] <Aankhen``> <span id="foo"></span><span id="bar"></span>

[08:24] <Aankhen``> `a` elements aren't the only ones that can have IDs. :-)

[08:24] <lumi> You've solved the problem of <a id="foo"/> being too long, at least :P

[08:24] * Aankhen`` grins.

[08:24] <moritz_> Aankhen``: it would look like this: <tr id="foo"><td><span id="bar"></span> :(

[08:24] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Yup.

[08:24] <moritz_> Aankhen``: then it's shorter to just put it inside the <td>

[08:24] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Why's that a problem?

[08:25] <Aankhen``> Er, what do you mean?

[08:25] <moritz_> <tr id="foo"><td id="bar">

[08:25] <Aankhen``> Ah, yes, certainly.

[08:25] <moritz_> shorter, and doesn't produce a warning ;)

[08:25] <lumi> What warning?

[08:25] <moritz_> lumi: the w3c validator used to warn on empty elements

[08:26] <moritz_> or was it just empty block elements?

[08:26] <lumi> Meanie

[08:26] <Aankhen``> What are these IDs for?

[08:26] <moritz_> Aankhen``: backlog ;)

[08:26] <Aankhen``> Oh, already did, but I missed the bit about "if lines are marked as spam".

[08:27] <Aankhen``> I'm not sure how you would solve backward compatibility by doing this.

[08:27] <Aankhen``> Could you give an example of the output you want?

[08:28] <moritz_> Aankhen``: wait a second... I just implemented what I want (problem solved), and I'll commit it in a second ;)

[08:32] <Aankhen``> OK.

[09:52] <Aankhen``> Tried reloading the page?

[09:52] <moritz_> masak: reload now, I changed the header...

[09:52] <masak> nope.. whoops there it was

[09:53] <masak> for a while the text was there

[09:53] <masak> it disappears after approx 2/3 of loading the page

[09:53] <Aankhen``> With the CSS and everything, or just unstyled content?

[09:53] <masak> not sure I understand the question

[09:54] <masak> you see the URL on the screenshot

[09:54] <masak> that's what I'm looking at -- no modifications locally

[09:54] <Aankhen``> When the text briefly appears, is it styled properly, or is it unstyled?

[09:54] <masak> it looks good

[09:54] <masak> I'll look again

[09:55] <Aankhen``> (I don't think it's the cause, but it's worth trying.)

[09:56] <moritz_> masak: try again, please ;)

[09:56] * masak tries again

[09:56] <moritz_> Aankhen``: is the overflow:hidden there to prevent horizontal scrolling?

[09:57] <masak> moritz_: everything works now

[09:57] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Yes. I didn't add it though.

[09:58] <moritz_> Aankhen``: it should be superflous now, because text is padded with spaces if it's too long, so I'll remove it

[09:58] <Aankhen``> OK.

[18:15] <moritz_> ?eval '001' .. '005'

[18:15] <evalbot_r> pugs: user error (*** *** Can't modify constant item: VUndef␤        at <prelude> line 782, column 9-46␤           <prelude> line 782, column 9-46␤    at)␤

[18:16] <moritz_> pugs -e "('001' .. '005').perl.say"

[18:16] <moritz_> ("001", "002", "003", "004", "005")

[18:16] <moritz_> so it's clearly evalbot_r that's borked :(

[18:18] *** agentzh joined
[18:19] <agentzh> when :pos(StrPos) and :continue are specified simultaneously for a p6 regex, which one takes the precedence?

[18:21] <moritz_> without knowing: probably :pos(StrPos)

[18:21] <moritz_> usually :continue is given at compile time, right?

[18:21] <moritz_> and :pos is rather used when applying the regex

[18:22] <moritz_> or do I understand that wrongly?

[18:22] *** ashleyb left

[18:24] *** weinig joined
[18:26] <agentzh> hmm

[18:27] *** REPLeffect_ left
[18:28] <agentzh> moritz_: in PCR's terms, :continue can be applied at runtime :(

[18:29] <moritz_> agentzh: aye, but it is less likely, isn't it?

[18:29] <agentzh> moritz_: *nod*

[18:29] *** thepler left
[18:29] <moritz_> agentzh: I think it's an error if both are applied at the same time...

[18:29] <agentzh> moritz_: good point :)

[18:30] <moritz_> agentzh: and if they aren't applied at the same time, the latter takes precedence

[18:30] <agentzh> the latter == :continue ?

[18:30] *** rindolf joined
[18:32] <moritz_> no, the one applied later

[18:32] <rindolf> Hi all.

[18:32] <moritz_> so if you compile with :foo and match with :bar, :bar should take precedence over :foo

[18:32] <moritz_> hi rindolf ;)

[18:32] <moritz_> agentzh: but if you compile with :foo :bar, and foo and bar conflict, it's an error

[18:33] <moritz_> agentzh: or if you match with both of them explicitly

[18:33] <agentzh> moritz_: okay

[18:33] <rindolf> Hi moritz_ 

[18:33] <rindolf> moritz_: what's up?

[18:33] <moritz_> rindolf: I've been hacking the irclogs lately, today I added fulltext search ;)

[18:33] *** Blwood joined
[18:34] <moritz_> rindolf: next thing on my agenda is perhaps adding context to the search results, or perhaps writing a kp6 homepage

[18:34] <agentzh> moritz_: what will the kp6 homepage look like? ;)

[18:34] <moritz_> rindolf: how are you? haven't seen you for a while

[18:35] <moritz_> agentzh: I don't know yet... do you have any proposals?

[18:35] <agentzh> moritz_: maybe an online demo?

[18:35] <agentzh> hehe

[18:35] <rindolf> moritz_: I'm trying to make sense of src/Pugs/Prim/List.hs

[18:35] <rindolf> And implement first

[18:36] <moritz_> agentzh: it could either be a fairly ministical thingy, or I could copy index.html from www.pugscode.org and take that layout

[18:36] <agentzh> or a set of documentation for kp6?

[18:36] <rindolf> moritz_: I'm fine. Been a bit lethargic lately.

[18:36] <moritz_> agentzh: no, the plan is to have something linkable when somebody blogs about kp6, or asks "I've never heard of that, what the hell is this?"

[18:36] <rindolf> I don't feel like doing anything.

[18:36] <agentzh> moritz_: okay

[18:37] <moritz_> agentzh: when I'm feeling lucky I might add a syntax hilighted source tree ;)

[18:38] <agentzh> moritz_: wow...

[18:38] <agentzh> moritz_: highlight the source tree of kp6?

[18:38] * diakopter tries to fix evalbot

[18:38] <moritz_> agentzh: why not? we have Text::VimColor, and vim has syntax hilighting of every relevant language

[18:39] <agentzh> moritz_: fair enough :)

[18:39] <moritz_> agentzh: including p6, p5 and the target languages (PIR, ...)

[18:39] *** franck___ joined
[18:39] <agentzh> cool

[18:41] *** evalbot_r left
[18:42] <diakopter> evalbot recompiles itself...

[18:42] <diakopter> er, its pugs

[18:42] <pasteling> "rindolf" at 88.152.16.170 pasted "Can anyone explain this? src/Pugs/Prim/List.hs" (11 lines, 365B) at http://sial.org/pbot/26532

[18:43] <agentzh> moritz_: which .t file did you mention that hang due to recent PCR changes?

[18:43] *** chris2 left
[18:43] <agentzh> moritz_: sorry, i can't remember that...

[18:44] <moritz_> agentzh: wait a sec...

[18:44] <agentzh> k

[18:44] <agentzh> t/xx-uncategorized/decode-utf-chunks.t?

[18:44] <pasteling> "evalbot_r" at 193.200.132.135 pasted "Pugs build failure" (305 lines, 17.1K) at http://sial.org/pbot/26533

[18:44] <diakopter> grr

[18:44] <agentzh> it's not very likely...

[18:45] *** evalbot_r joined
[18:45] <moritz_> agentzh: it was t/builtins/strings/subst.t, but I can't reproduce it anymore

[18:45] *** ashelyb_ left
[18:45] <agentzh> moritz_: funny

[18:46] <moritz_> but test 7 dies with:

[18:46] <moritz_> *** Cannot parse regex: l

[18:46] <moritz_> *** Error: Error: Error in rule: unknown parameter 'g' at /home/moritz/pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule/lib/Pugs/Runtime/Match/HsBridge.pm line 37

[18:46] * diakopter still tries to fix evalbot (and its autobuilds)

[18:46] <agentzh> moritz_: the only .t file killed by auto-smoke is t/xx-uncategorized/decode-utf-chunks.t according to the cron report

[18:46] *** franck___ left
[18:46] <agentzh> moritz_: looking

[18:47] <agentzh> :g is no longer a valid p6 regex modifier, right?

[18:47] <agentzh> i think it's now renamed to :continue or something

[18:48] <Juerd> IIRC it's still :g

[18:48] <moritz_> m:g:i/\s* (\w*) \s* ,?/; is an example in S05

[18:48] <agentzh> so the error message given by HsBridge is something i'd expect.

[18:48] <Juerd> S05 still mentions :g

[18:48] <agentzh> Juerd: oh

[18:48] <moritz_> :g for :global

[18:49] <Juerd> I hadn't seen :b before. I like that!

[18:49] <Juerd> (And want it in Perl 5, right now!) :)

[18:49] <agentzh> hehe

[18:49] <Juerd> What I do now, is I unidecode first.

[18:49] <Juerd> Works equally well so far.

[18:49] <agentzh> i can't see the difference between :g and :c

[18:50] <agentzh> could anyone explain that for me?

[18:50] <Juerd> agentzh: m:c/.../ is like p5's /\G.../

[18:50] <Juerd> Or probably more like /\G .*? .../

[18:50] <Juerd> x

[18:51] <Juerd> That is, it doesn't start at the beginning, if the subject already has a .pos

[18:51] <agentzh> isn't it the same behavior of :g?

[18:51] <Juerd> No

[18:52] <agentzh> why?

[18:53] <Juerd> Actually, I think S05 is inconsistent so far :)

[18:53] <agentzh> ah

[18:53] <Juerd> Because :g/:global isn't described, just listed.

[18:53] <agentzh> *nod*

[18:53] <agentzh> PCR currently doesn't handle :global at all

[18:54] <Juerd> It's used and listed, but not explained.

[18:54] <agentzh> so there's no surprise the HsBridge complains about that.

[18:54] <Juerd> Anyway, it feels to me like :g is like list /g, and :c is like scalar /g

[18:54] *** franck____ left
[18:54] <agentzh> Juerd: understood

[18:54] <agentzh> TimToady?

[18:55] <Juerd> TimToady: Please explain to us the difference between :g and :c -- :g is not explained in S05

[18:55] <agentzh> hehe

[18:55] <Juerd> gmta

[18:55] *** drrho left
[18:56] <agentzh> heh, he's not here right now

[18:56] <agentzh> it seems

[18:57] <agentzh> or a p6l mail is more appropriate :)

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ | [PCR]

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ | * removed t/emitter/00-ratchet.t

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ | * renamed t/emitter/00-basic.t to 00-ratchet.t

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ | * fixed the :p and :continue logic a bit (but it's still

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ |   not quite right)

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17173 | agentz++ | * updated Rule.pmc using the latest emitter

[19:03] <pugs_svnbot> r17174 | moritz++ | added a kp6 homepage, available from http://www.pugscode.org/kp6.html

[19:03] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17174 - Pugs - Trac

[19:04] <moritz_> Juerd: will documents in docs/feather/pugscode.org/ automatically be available via http?

[19:05] <Juerd> moritz_: In theory, yes :)

[19:05] <moritz_> Juerd: in practice, theory is overrated ;)

[19:05] <Juerd> http://feather.perl6.nl/README

[19:06] <agentzh> moritz_: i think so.

[19:06] <moritz_> Juerd: thanks

[19:08] <agentzh> hmm, :g should reset :pos if the match fail while :c should never reset :pos...does it sound right?

[19:09] <agentzh> s/:pos/.pos/g

[19:10] <Juerd> You mean s:g/\:pos/.pos/ ;)

[19:10] <agentzh> hehe, i was using p5 regex syntax :)

[19:10] <Juerd> I think this is one of the very few regexes that actually looks *worse* in P6 :)

[19:11] <agentzh> hmm, maybe s:g/ ':pos' / .pos / ?
