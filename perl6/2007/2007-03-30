[13:21] <Jedai> I found webpage that seems to suggest it's a case problem

[13:22] <Jedai> Others (like the Apache Committer FAQ) suggest that's because I need to use the https rep and not http, so I used svn switch but it still doesn't work

[13:22] <kolibrie> Jedai: it looks like your account is still 'pending'.  The next step is to reply to the commitbit invitation - I can send you a new one if you need it

[13:26] <Jedai> kolibrie: No I already did that (I'm logged in commitbit.pugscode right now), is there another step I missed ?

[13:27] <kolibrie> Jedai: I don't think so, but you still show up as 'pending' on my display

[13:27] <kolibrie> Jedai: you are chaddai.fouche

[13:27] <kolibrie> ?

[13:28] <Jedai> Yes, I am

[13:28] <kolibrie> Jedai: I'll send you another invitation

[13:28] <Jedai> Thanks again

[13:29] <Jedai> I'll try to get it right this time ! ;)

[13:30] <kolibrie> Jedai: oh, that's why, you have 'Jedai' and 'jedai'

[13:31] <kolibrie> Jedai: the lowercase one is pending - and probably is what your subversion is set to

[13:31] <kolibrie> the uppercase one is all set up

[13:31] <Jedai> Yes, I had a commitbit some long time ago, but I lost the computer I had recorded the info on it

[13:32] <kolibrie> so you should be able change your subversion to use the 'Jedai' one, and I can delete the other account

[13:32] <kolibrie> or, the other way around

[13:32] <Jedai> Could you try to delete the "jedai" account then

[13:33] <kolibrie> Jedai: done

[13:34] <Jedai> It doesn't seems to solve the problem... :(

[13:35] <kolibrie> Jedai: did you change your subversion to use the uppercase username?

[13:36] * kolibrie sent Jedai an invitation for the 'Jedai' account, too

[13:36] <Jedai> I already used the uppercase username but I hoped it was a case problem

[16:50] <DarkWolf84> oh right, got it :)

[16:51] <[particle]> does that mean p6 will be released every day?

[16:51] <DarkWolf84> I heared it the day before

[16:51] <moritz> [particle]: no, we will just change our notion of "day" ;)

[17:05] <[particle]> well, parrot won't be ready this year, i can almost guarantee.

[17:05] <jrockway> DarkWolf84: unlikely

[17:05] <[particle]> not unless we get a lot more help

[17:05] <jrockway> basically perl6 needs to be written 2 more times

[17:05] <moritz> jrockway: why so often?

[17:05] <jrockway> because it has to bootstrap itself

[17:05] <diotalevi> "Perl 6", "Perl 6", ok, we're done now?

[17:05] <moritz> jrockway: it can be bootstraped with pugs, can't, it?

[17:05] *** sachu is now known as manju

[17:06] <jrockway> pugs isn't done

[17:06] <DarkWolf84> pugs can't host itself

[17:06] <jrockway> although the parts of pugs written in perl6 can be reused i assume

[17:06] <jrockway> assume

[17:06] *** manju is now known as manjuj

[17:06] <jrockway> i do not know enough to say for sure :)

[17:06] <moritz> jrockway: I know, but it's further than p6-in-p6

[17:06] <jrockway> yeah

[17:06] <jrockway> perl6 is a really big project

[17:06] <jrockway> it's condensing though

[17:07] <moritz> jrockway: so we only need to write 1 and a half p6 implementations ;)

[17:07] <jrockway> people have a feel for it now

[17:07] <jrockway> so that's a good sign

[17:07] <[particle]> the test suite needs to be refactored heavily

[17:07] <jrockway> yeah, i noticed that

[17:07] <[particle]> before it can be reused by non-pugs projects

[17:07] * jrockway wonders how many tests are duplicates

[17:07] <[particle]> think coverity could help?

[17:07] *** diotalevi joined
[17:08] <[particle]> that'd be nice, looking for test code duplication :)

[17:08] <DarkWolf84> :)

[17:09] <DarkWolf84> some parts like let and temp vars r broken for now

[17:09] <DarkWolf84> pugscc don't work

[17:10] <manjuj> hi. i would like to contribute to Pugs. i know C programming, and am willing to learn Perl and Haskell. Where do I start?

[17:10] <DarkWolf84> there is a mach work to be done

[17:10] <[particle]> all the todo info in tests must be made platform specific, and moved to adverbial style

[17:14] <manjuj> i haven't got the mail yet, does the mail contain pointers as to how to do the followup?

[17:14] <moritz> manjuj: yes

[17:15] <[particle]> and the mail does take a few minutes, it's not immediate. dunno why.

[17:15] <manjuj> moritz: thanks

[17:15] <manjuj> [particle]:ok

[17:15] <[particle]> manjuj: if you'd like to program in C straight away, there's plenty of work to do on parrot.

[17:15] <[particle]> if you'd like to work in perl/haskell, pugs is the project for you

[17:16] <moritz> duh, /me just added a whole serendipity installation to an svn repository - 25 MB at once :(

[17:16] <manjuj> [particle]: ok

[17:16] <[particle]> me and the other parrot folks hang out an #parrot on irc.perl.org

[17:16] <moritz> perhaps that was not the best idea ;)

[17:17] <PerlJam> manjuj++ the more the merrier!  :-)

[17:18] <perlmonkey2> [particle] I've looked at the timeline, but I still am not sure why there are two seperate projects for Perl6.  Is it that Pugs might be v1.0 by the end of the year and Parrot won't be finished for much longer?

[17:18] *** pjcj joined
[17:19] <moritz> perlmonkey2: no, it's a bit different...

[17:19] <moritz> perlmonkey2: p6 will be written in p6...

[17:19] <moritz> self hosting

[17:19] <moritz> so it has to be written in p6

[17:19] <moritz> and it will use parrot as a backend

[17:19] <perlmonkey2> But first it needs to be written in something else.

[17:19] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: What makes you think there are two separate projects for perl6?  ;)

[17:19] <moritz> and pugs will bootstrap p6

[17:20] <moritz> perlmonkey2: that's what pugs is for (apart from beeing fun ;-)

[17:21] <[particle]> perlmonkey2: the only thing "official" about perl 6 is the spec, and the test suite

[17:21] <[particle]> there will not be One Official Implementation

[17:21] <perlmonkey2> Doesn't Parrot make Pugs unnecessary though?

[17:21] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: no.

[17:22] <[particle]> so, implementors are free to write it in parrot, or perl 5, or haskell, etc

[17:22] <perlmonkey2> I thought the Perl5 and C implementations died, and only Pugs is still going?

[17:23] <moritz> perlmonkey2: no, not dead ;)

[17:23] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: not quite.

[17:23] <moritz> and afaict p6 was never supposed to be written entirely in C

[17:23] <moritz> or was it?

[17:23] <PerlJam> perl6 doesn't care what it's written in. :)

[17:24] <PerlJam> moritz: in as much as parrot is written in C, perl6 will be "written in C"  :-)

[17:24] <[particle]> the pugs repository contains multiple perl 6 implementations

[17:24] <perlmonkey2> finished implementations?

[17:25] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: how can an implementation be finished when the spec isn't finished?

[17:25] <perlmonkey2> That is a good question.  Do you know the answer?

[17:25] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: all of the implementations right now are about trying out the ideas that perl6 wants to incorporate.

[17:26] <PerlJam> perlmonkey2: They're exploratory.  Can we do this?  etc.

[17:26] <perlmonkey2> Which is why I'm very excited about Pugs.

[17:27] *** DrSlump_2 joined
[17:28] *** dmpk2k joined
[17:32] <[particle]> there are no finished implementations

[17:32] <moritz> which is very sad ;)

[17:33] *** dmpk2k|z joined
[17:33] *** fglock joined
[17:33] <moritz> [particle]: no, I'd still be writing docs ;)

[17:33] <perlmonkey2> Heh, every time I try to find out the reasoning for both Pugs and Parrot, I seem to cause some friction.  My best guess so far is that Pugs is to get Perl6 running Perl6 ASAP, and Parrot is the magical virtual machine closely aligned with the Perl6 project.

[17:34] <moritz> I'm currently writing a German website on p6, and inted to translate a few docs to German once they are a bit more settled

[17:34] <[particle]> perlmonkey2: parrot is a bottom-up implementation

[17:34] <[particle]> pugs is top-down

[17:35] <[particle]> pugs is: let's implement the parser, so we can write perl6 now. we'll compile it to whatever backend we can get to work reasonably well.

[17:35] <[particle]> parrot is: let's design a virtual machine for dynamic languages, with perl 6 spec in mind

[17:35] *** pjcj joined
[17:36] <moritz> originally pugs was "let's learn haskell" ;-)

[17:36] <[particle]> there's already some idea, design, code, and test sharing between the two projects

[17:37] <[particle]> there's not friction between the pugs and parrot implementors

[17:37] <[particle]> but sometimes i wish there was some more communication

[17:37] <moritz> [particle]: just invite them all, provide much beer, and they _will_ communicate ;)

[17:38] <perlmonkey2> I just want to be able to use my favorite language AND use threading :p

[17:39] <moritz> perlmonkey2: and what is your favorite lang? p5 already implements threading ;)

[17:39] <DarkWolf84> p6 is more nice

[17:39] <DarkWolf84> :)

[17:39] <perlmonkey2> I wasted 2 months on a threaded project in P5.  They are fragile fragile, FRAGILE things.  At least when mixed with shared memory.

[17:39] <DarkWolf84> more nise than p5

[17:39] <diotalevi> . o O ( Maybe he wants *sane* threading too )

[17:40] <perlmonkey2> I switched to POE and cried about the wasted processors.

[17:40] <[particle]> perlmonkey2: the final threads spec has not yet been written for parrot

[17:40] <moritz> diotalevi: nobody wants sanity when you can have magic instead ;)

[17:40] <diotalevi> perlmonkey2: I thought we warned you off about threading in p5.

[17:40] <perlmonkey2> you did

[17:41] <rindolf> Hi all.

[17:41] <avar> just use forks:)

[17:41] <rindolf> I wish #parrot was hosted here.

[17:41] <perlmonkey2> rindolf, this isn't the perlmonkey you probably know.

[17:41] <rindolf> perlmonkey2: oh. 

[17:41] <perlmonkey2> I'm from PM where perlmonkey one hasn't been active for a long time.

[17:41] <moritz> rindolf: what refrains you from connecting to irc.perl.org√ü

[17:41] <rindolf> moritz: nothing.

[17:41] <moritz> s/√ü/?/ (damn german keyboard)

[17:42] * diotalevi recently found out that BerkeleyDB has a really nice feature for sharing memory. A db's environment gets shared with other processes pretty much automagically.

[17:42] <rindolf> moritz: it's just that Freenode is friendlier.

[17:42] <perlmonkey2> diotalive: tell us more....

[17:42] <perlmonkey2> s/diotalive/diotalevi/

[17:43] <perlmonkey2> diotalevi: do they share the on disk object, and use their own seperate caches?  And there are no transactional issues?

[17:44] <diotalevi> perlmonkey2: like anything, dbs are commonly used for shared state between processes or threads or whatever. All the caching and other stuff can exist as files on disk that are all mmap'd into your N processes/threads.

[17:44] <diotalevi> And bdb does transactions n' logging n stuff.

[17:44] <avar> why not host it on irc.perl.org?

[17:44] <avar> (#perl6/#parrot)

[17:45] <avar> not that it matters in the least to anyone with a decent client

[17:45] * diotalevi thought it unfortunate that #perl6 wasn't on irc.perl.org when he didn'th ave a decent client.

[17:45] <moritz> avar: just personal preference I guess

[17:46] <perlmonkey2> diotalevi: I tried using MySQL, but it was too slow, I needed read,process,write in < 00:00.01

[17:47] <diotalevi> *shrug*

[17:57] <[particle]> sao paulo?

[17:57] <fglock> Porto Alegre

[17:58] <[particle]> ah.

[17:58] <[particle]> let me know when it's in cuzco, peru. i'll go back there in a heartbeat :)

[17:58] <lambdabot> Title: fisl8-2007 - FÛrum Internacional Software Livre

[17:59] <fglock> yeah, I've been in Cuzco - very nice :)

[17:59] <fglock> the plan for YAPC::SA is to work in p6-in-p6; probably in the regex engine

[18:00] <Lorn> fglock: hey :)

[18:00] <Lorn> fglock: is YAPC::Brasil no? YAPC::SA is on Salvador :)

[18:00] <[particle]> that's a good plan

[18:01] <fglock> Lorn: I'm lost, too many conferences

[18:01] <Lorn> fglock: hehe, did you see my msg? we need ideas :P

[18:02] <fglock> Lorn: re plan - we could refactor kp6 regex compiler, to be able to parse the "STD" grammar

[18:02] <Lorn> fglock: ok, i can study STD? 

[18:03] <fglock> Lorn: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/Perl-6.0.0-STD.pm

[18:03] <Lorn> fglock: or better, why i need to study in perl6 code?

[18:05] <fglock> eden_c: pong

[18:05] <Lorn> fglock: ok, tks

[18:06] <fglock> Lorn: just checked: YAPC::SA is in Porto Alegre, YAPC::Brasil is in Salvador, YAPC::Sao_Paulo is in... Sao Paulo

[18:07] *** justatheory joined
[18:07] <Lorn> fglock: really? i confuse too :)

[18:07] <Lorn> fglock: well, we need to "ping" argentina, rigth?

[18:08] <fglock> sure

[18:12] <moritz> fglock: does kp6 use perl5 as a backend by default?

[18:13] <fglock> moritz: there is no default, actually - it depends on what "plugins" you use

[18:13] <moritz> fglock: and which are available, and working?

[18:14] <fglock> moritz: looking

[18:15] <fglock> moritz: you can compile p6-to-miniperl6, and then miniperl6-to-perl5 (or parrot, but that's incomplete)

[18:16] <moritz> fglock: ok, thanks

[18:16] <fglock> or p6-to-perl5, in several different implementations; there are some experiments of perl6-to-C too

[18:17] <eden_c> fglock: what's the address of the proxy you use again? I forgot to write it down the first time you told me :/

[18:18] *** bernhard joined
[18:18] <fglock> eden_c: proxy?

[18:18] <Lorn> fglock: url to access #perl6 via web

[18:19] <fglock> feather.perl6.nl - but you need to register with Juerd first (send him an email with your full name, address)

[18:20] <eden_c> fglock: what's his email?

[18:20] <eden_c> fglock: I'm using a horrible proxy that forces me to reconect every hour :/

[18:20] <DarkWolf84> i'm not using proxy

[18:25] <fglock> moritz: kp6 is "perl6-in-perl6", to some extent. It just didn't get much attention

[18:37] <eden_c> Juerd: just answered your reply

[18:38] <fglock> Lorn: the idea is to improve a p6regex engine, in order to have STD parsed, and possibly compile

[18:38] <Lorn> fglock: ok

[18:43] <fglock> Lorn: don't take it too seriously - if I know myself, we will end up working on something completely different :)

[19:50] <[particle]> and you're welcome!

[19:51] <fglock> @tell audreyt I can implement regexes in plain pugs using macros, it seems - it needs some cool syntax, like 'macro circumfix:</ />' and some way to deal with infix:<~~>

[19:51] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[20:16] <fglock> this can be abused into an actual regex implementation

[20:17] <moritz> that's sick... and cool ;)
