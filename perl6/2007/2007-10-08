[04:38] <Tene> It's been developed over the past couple of weeks or so (I think) and is now about up to the level of the perl5 backend.

[07:15] <agentzh> hi, a p5 question: how to release a very p5 hash immediately? p5's GC is very slow for a hash as big as several GB.

[07:15] <agentzh> *very big

[07:16] <agentzh> sorry if it's a bit OT :P

[07:16] <jql> p5 gc doesn't do anything at all after undef %hash;

[07:16] <jql> there's no compacting/copying gc to trigger

[07:16] <jql> it immediately frees, and that's it. :(

[07:35] <Aankhen``> Tene: Re: the Lisp backend for KP6, it's not really up to the level of the Perl 5 backend yet since it doesn't support objects, for one.

[07:36] <Aankhen``> As far as implementations go, it doesn't use anything SBCL-specific, so in theory it ought to work on any conforming implementation.

[07:37] *** drrho joined
[07:45] <agentzh> Aankhen``: how about the list-backend's performance?

[07:46] <agentzh> jql: it doesn't work for us. undef %hash still takes 20 min to complete, it seems.

[07:46] <jql> wow, that's an impressive hash you have

[07:47] <Aankhen``> agentzh: I'm not really sure, never bothered to measure it. The only metric I have is from a while back, when avar measured a compiled test performance and found it only slightly slower than the equivalent Perl 5 code.

[07:48] <Aankhen``> s/test/test's/

[07:48] <agentzh> Aankhen``: okay :)

[07:49] <Aankhen``> That was before support for a lot of things was added though, including formal sub arguments, all of which does inevitably add overhead.

[07:49] <agentzh> *nod*

[07:49] <Aankhen``> Still, I'd expect it to be pretty durned fast once compiled.

[07:49] <agentzh> heh

[07:49] <Aankhen``> The best part is, so far I've just been focusing on clarity.

[07:49] <Aankhen``> Nothing about KP6-CL takes performance into account.

[07:50] <agentzh> fair enough :)

[07:51] <Aankhen``> Oh yeah, it's also missing a lot of control structures, since I wasn't very interested in them and no one (except fax) was either. :-P

[17:06] <avar> have you been modeling the lisp stuff after the perl implementation or doing things differently?

[17:06] <avar> everything in the p5 one works on ::DISPATCH, wondering if we have an equivalent

[17:06] <pugs_svnbot> r18318 | ruoso++ | [yap6] yes... it is another prospective perl 6 implementation, but now, a simple C runtime, hopefully a target for kp6

[17:07] <ruoso> fglock, there it is

[17:08] <moritz_> ruoso: is the intention to built something like nqp, but on C?

[17:08] <ruoso> moritz_, hmm... no...

[17:08] <moritz_> i.e. fast, but not a full implementation?

[17:08] <moritz_> ok

[17:08] <ruoso> to build something like kp6

[17:09] <ruoso> but targetting that runtime

[17:09] <ruoso> actually

[17:09] <ruoso> a runtime for kp6

[17:09] <Aankhen``> avar: I don't think we do.

[17:09] <Aankhen``> avar: I haven't been modelling it after the Perl implementation.

[17:09] <ruoso> moritz_, the idea is to provide the minimal runtime for a MOP implementation

[17:09] <ruoso> that would support real p6 in the future

[17:10] <ruoso> moritz_, but I don't plan that to be complete as a start

[17:10] <ruoso> I mean

[17:10] <ruoso> it can have partial releases

[17:10] <ruoso> supporting only part of the specs

[17:10] <ruoso> but the real target is a real implementation

[17:11] <moritz_> ok

[17:11] <avar> Aankhen``: Basically we're missing the whole MOP.pm stuff

[17:11] <pmurias> ruoso: you decided against using Parrot's guts?

[17:11] <ruoso> pmurias, too complex to begin 

[17:11] <ruoso> heh

[17:12] <ruoso> I couldn't figure out where to start from

[17:12] <ruoso> it'll be much simpler than parrot

[17:12] <avar> sub ::DISPATCH {

[17:12] <avar>     my $invocant = shift;

[17:12] <avar>     unless ($invocant->{_dispatch}) {

[17:12] <avar>     }

[17:12] <avar>     $invocant->{_dispatch}($invocant,@_);

[17:12] <avar> }

[17:12] <ruoso> and, of course, much less usefull, when parrot is ready

[17:13] <avar> hrm

[17:13] <avar> Aankhen``: look at stuff like:

[17:13] <avar> my $meta_Value = ::DISPATCH( $::Class, 'new', "Value");

[17:13] <avar> $::Value = $meta_Value->PROTOTYPE();

[17:13] <avar> $meta_Value->add_method( 'WHICH', :

[17:13] <ruoso> home &

[17:14] <avar> Aankhen``: and make_class which is the parent..

[17:14] <avar> uh, wrapper for doing that

[17:15] <avar> we could piggy-back on CLOS for a lot of this, like the %dispatch member always being a lambda 

[17:16] <avar> we have some of this, like routines for checking whether an int is true, but how we're doing it is the problem

[17:16] <avar> (kp6-true isn't really "dispatched" it just checks the value member..

[17:17] <Aankhen``> Yes, currently everything's hard-coded rather than being objects.

[17:19] <avar> we have ::DISPATCH((make-instance 'kp6-Int :value 1337), 'true')

[17:20] <avar> ::DISPATCH is just $invocant->{_dispatch}($invocant,@_);

[17:27] <avar> why are C<say "foo"> and C<"foo".say> different in the AST?

[17:28] <Aankhen``> One is a function application, the other is a method call?

[17:28] <avar> I mean how is it different as far s the language is concerned

[17:29] <avar> if I rewrote everything to use method calls what would break

[17:29] <Aankhen``> The former is an indirect object call.

[17:29] <Aankhen``> (AFAIK.)

[17:29] <Aankhen``> Or perhaps "foo".say simply calls say "foo" under the cover.

[17:29] <Aankhen``> What are you planning to rewrite to use method calls?

[17:30] <avar> just wondering why they have to be different

[17:31] <Aankhen``> Actually, I'm not sure what the .say method is.

[17:33] <Aankhen``> I'll probably find out soon enough though.  Objects are next on my list.

[17:49] <Aankhen``> Why is ::Module commented out in Ast.pm?

[17:49] <avar> Aankhen``: I think we can definetely piggy-back on CLOS 

[17:49] *** Kattana left
[17:49] <avar> if it's the 'use Foo' thing then probably because it broke everything

[17:50] <Aankhen``> `class Module { ... }` is commented out.

[17:50] <Aankhen``> And I don't think we can piggy-back on CLOS.

[17:50] *** japhb left
[17:51] <avar> why?

[17:51] <avar> You don't have to use all of clos..

[17:51] <Aankhen``> Uh.

[17:51] <Aankhen``> We're going to be using CLOS the same way we're using it right now, if that's what you meant.

[17:51] <Aankhen``> In the end it's going to be CLOS objects.

[17:52] <avar> I was just thinking of using generics to handle dispatch instead of something custom, mainly

[17:52] <Aankhen``> But, for example, we're not going to create a new CLOS class for each Perl 6 class, or use generic functions.

[17:54] <avar> well we'll see

[17:57] <pmurias> Aankhen``: ::Module is comented out because it was replaced by CompUnit

[17:57] <Aankhen``> pmurias: Ah.

[17:57] <Aankhen``> So ::CompUnit should be generating a new package?

[17:57] <Aankhen``> (Assuming it doesn't exist already.)

[17:57] <pmurias> yes

[19:33] <TimToady> avar: I think I want to play with TRE for my lexer engine for STD

[19:33] <[particle]> TRE?

[19:34] <TimToady> http://laurikari.net/tre//

[19:34] <lambdabot> Title: TRE home page

[19:34] <TimToady> there are Perl and Haskell bindings

[19:35] <TimToady> so either I need to "use v5" to get the re::engine bindings, or get someone to hook up the Haskell bindings to pugs

[19:36] <avar> note that re::engine only works on 5.10

[19:36] <avar> tre is posix compatable so any posix regex binding will do

[19:36] <TimToady> well, I've got 5.9.mumble installed

[19:36] <avar> yeah 5.9.5/5.10

[19:36] <TimToady> but tre does tagged transitions efficiently, I think

[19:37] <TimToady> so I can pull out longest tokens that include subrule matches

[19:38] <TimToady> but when I cpanp install it, it tells me that cpans's re is out of date :(

[19:39] <avar> can you paste the error?

[19:39] *** barney left
[19:39] <TimToady> [ERROR] The core Perl 5.009005 module 're' (0.08) is more recent than the latest release on CPAN (0.05). Aborting install.

[19:44] <TimToady> though for the STD prototype, I'd probably just as soon use the Haskell version if it were hooked up, since I'm targeting pugs right now.

[19:44] <TimToady> but every time I argue with ghc I lose... :/

[19:49] <avar> that's cpanp -i re::engine::TRE ?

[19:50] <TimToady> no -, but yes

[20:04] <TimToady> TRE.xs:26: error: ‘RXf_SPLIT’ undeclared (first use in this function)

[20:05] *** jisom left
[20:05] <TimToady> is 5.9.5 not sufficiently 5.10ish?

[20:05] <avar> yes, your 5.9.5 just isn't recent enough, there were a lot of changes while it was called .5, you need to upgrade

[20:06] <TimToady> thanks

[20:06] *** jferrero joined
[20:06] <avar> anyway I still don't quite see the point to be honest:) But then again I haven't studied tre so closely

[20:06] <avar> but I think you mainly win on patterns not going exponential and not crapping out on some pathological patterns

[20:08] <TimToady> the crucial part is knowing which part of the pattern matched

[20:10] <pasteling> "TimToady" at 71.139.11.229 pasted "sample lexer for expect_term" (923 lines, 27.4K) at http://sial.org/pbot/27951

[20:10] <TimToady> I need to be able to run the pattern above and know which STD rules were traversed to get there

[20:10] *** blindfish left
[20:11] <TimToady> I think TRE will give me that

[20:12] <avar> I didn't see anything like that in its manual, it has an interface for that?

[20:12] <TimToady> it does substr captures

[20:13] <TimToady> as described in this paper by the same person: http://laurikari.net/ville/spire2000-tnfa.ps

[20:14] <avar> I don't think that's in the re::engine::TRE interface though

[20:14] <TimToady> if you can pull out $1, $2, as documented, it can

[20:15] <TimToady> asssuming you haven't put a hard-coded limit in

[20:16] <avar> that's to get the parts of the string that were matched, but as I understand it you want to know the parts of the regex that were matched to get there right?

[20:16] <TimToady> see example--as long as all the parens get their own number, I can derive that

[20:16] <avar> ah

[20:16] <TimToady> also asssuming that the -> foo notation turns into ()

[20:19] <TimToady> in the long run I'd like to rewrite TRE or something like it in Perl 6

[20:20] <TimToady> because it's almost exactly what I was thinking of with the revisions of S05 to define longest token matching

[20:21] <TimToady> if we integrate it well, nobody ever has to write their own lexer again.

[20:21] <TimToady> that's the goal of all this autolex stuff I've been working on
