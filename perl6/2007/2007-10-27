[16:57] <DarkWolf84> it's really quiet

[17:01] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: yeah

[17:02] <pmurias> sundays are the most quiet

[17:03] <DarkWolf84> I can help little with my skils

[17:04] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: do you want do anything particular?

[17:04] <DarkWolf84> for now I have writen only one or two test file for pugs

[17:04] <DarkWolf84> yeah

[17:04] <DarkWolf84> why not

[17:05] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: i could help you if you want to do something with kp6

[17:06] <DarkWolf84> thanks pmurias 

[17:07] <DarkWolf84> where to start from

[17:08] <DarkWolf84> the code is too mach

[17:08] *** rindolf left
[17:08] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: what do you want to do?

[17:10] <DarkWolf84> I wan't to learn mach for kp6

[17:10] <pmurias> mach = ?

[17:10] <DarkWolf84> much

[17:10] <DarkWolf84> my bad english

[17:11] <DarkWolf84> that's a big barier for me now

[17:12] <DarkWolf84> I don't know about what is done

[17:14] <pmurias> i think the best way to learn about kp6 would be to try to add a small feature to it

[17:15] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:16] <DarkWolf84> is thera something like a roadmap

[17:16] <pmurias> ../doc/kp6-roadmap.pod

[17:16] <pmurias> v6/docs/kp6-roadmap.pod

[17:17] <pmurias> but it's very general

[17:17] <DarkWolf84> ok

[17:17] <DarkWolf84> I'll read it

[17:19] <DarkWolf84> I could not found it there

[17:20] <DarkWolf84> found it

[17:21] <DarkWolf84> the bootstrap is finished?

[17:24] *** amnesiac joined
[17:26] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: no

[17:26] <pmurias> it's in initial stages v6-Onion

[17:28] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[17:28] <DarkWolf84> I know a little perl5 and little perl6 oand can help with the tests

[17:29] <DarkWolf84> they are writen in perl5 aren't they

[17:29] <pmurias> in perl6

[17:30] *** ludan joined
[17:30] <DarkWolf84> ok

[17:30] <ludan> hi

[17:31] <pmurias> ludan: hi

[17:31] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: adding new features to the regex engine might be a fun and not very difficult task

[17:32] <DarkWolf84> I like regex :)

[17:32] <DarkWolf84> I'll see what can be done

[17:32] <pmurias> see src/KindaPerl6/Visitor/Emit/Perl5Regexn

[18:32] <DarkWolf84> so onion is the next state of kp6

[18:34] *** Psyche^ joined
[18:41] *** chris2_ left

[18:55] *** theorbtwo joined
[19:00] *** rindolf joined
[19:08] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: there was a grammar bug before

[19:10] <pmurias> kp6 is compiled by now mp6 now which is a bit strange

[19:11] <pmurias> is should work withought a ; after every } now, but removing them might brake something

[19:11] <pmurias> they will be hopefull removed in onion

[19:12] <pmurias> any questions about Perl5Regex?

[19:22] <DarkWolf84> yeah

[19:22] <DarkWolf84> I don't know what do \X

[19:22] *** weinig left
[19:23] *** weinig joined
[19:23] <DarkWolf84> and I don't know how to test my changes

[19:24] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: how to do \X?

[19:24] <pmurias> DarkWolf84: you can write a test script like in t/kp6

[19:25] <pmurias> you run it with script/kp6 -Bperl5rx

[19:25] <DarkWolf84> that \X is in \N mach and I don't know why is there

[19:25] <DarkWolf84> return '(?:(?!\n\r?|\r\n?)\X)';

[19:26] <pmurias> the rule tests live in t/kp6/grammar

[19:26] <pmurias> the \N is 'not a newline'

[19:27] <pmurias> so it checks if the next character is a newline and matches a character if it's not

[19:27] <pmurias> you have seen Synopsis 5?

[19:27] <DarkWolf84> I have to read it carefuly next time

[19:27] <pmurias> \N is now perl5's '.'

[19:28] <pmurias> i use grep ;)

[19:29] <pmurias> if you want to see the ast a program compiles to use script/kp6 -Cast

[19:35] <pmurias> if you want to see what the emitted source code use script/kp6 -Cperl5rx

[19:49] *** amnesiac left
[19:49] * DarkWolf84 reads Synopsis 5

[19:52] *** penk joined
