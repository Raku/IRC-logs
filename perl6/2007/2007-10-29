[08:50] <moritz_> can PCR perform any unsafe operations?

[08:51] <moritz_> or to rephrase the question: is it safe for a CGI script to feed unsanitized input into PCR?

[08:55] *** rgs joined
[08:58] *** Silence left
[09:00] <agentzh> moritz_: it can

[09:00] <agentzh> moritz_: in action blocks

[09:00] <agentzh> and in verbatim blocks like %{ ... %}

[09:00] <moritz_> agentzh: so what language is executed in the action blocks? p5?

[09:00] <agentzh> moritz_: for online version, i think it's wise to disable all these forms

[09:01] <agentzh> p5 going through a p6 source filter

[09:01] <agentzh> for the action blocks in rules

[09:01] <moritz_> is there a specific option to disable them?

[09:01] <agentzh> moritz_: not yet...

[09:02] <agentzh> but it's trivial to write in the emitter ;)

[09:02] <agentzh> or the parser

[09:02] <moritz_> emitter sounds better ;)

[09:02] <agentzh> actually parser is easier to hack ;)

[09:03] <agentzh> but modifying the emitter is better :)

[09:03] <moritz_> I have a _very_ shallow cgi wrapper around the regex tracer, without any error handling

[09:03] <agentzh> cool

[09:03] <agentzh> moritz+

[09:04] <agentzh> +

[09:04] <moritz_> when I fixed the safety issues I'll try to fix the directory permissions, and then it can go online

[09:04] <agentzh> awesome!

[09:05] <moritz_> but soon I'll have to attend some courses, so be patient ;)

[09:05] * agentzh can surely be patient.

[09:06] <agentzh> too bad perl 5 does not have a general sandbox ;)

[09:06] <moritz_> :/

[09:06] <agentzh> will perl 6 have one?

[09:08] <moritz_> probably implementation dependant

[09:08] <moritz_> pugs has one

[09:08] <agentzh> *nod*

[09:08] <moritz_> kp6 has one, too

[09:08] <agentzh> cool

[09:08] <moritz_> kp6: mkdir('/tmp/foo/');

[09:09] <exp_evalbot> r18678: OUTPUT[no method 'say' in Class 'Str'␤ at compiled/perl5-kp6-mp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MOP.pm line 132␤    KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::MOP::__ANON__('KindaPerl6::Runtime::Perl5::DispatchSugar::Dispatch=HASH(0x86...', 'say') called at

[09:09] <exp_evalbot> r18678: OUTPUT[1␤]

[09:09] <agentzh> i'll have a try to hack a safemode option into PCR...

[09:10] <agentzh> it should be easy...

[09:10] <moritz_> damned, that command really created /chroot/tmp/foo

[09:10] <moritz_> it seems that kp6 safe mode is b0rked ;/

[09:11] <agentzh> ....

[09:11] * agentzh grins.

[09:11] <moritz_> at least it runs in a chroot

[09:12] <agentzh> i wonder how to implement such things properly

[09:12] <agentzh> kp6 checks a list of dangerous functions internally?

[09:12] <moritz_> pugs has the 'is safe' and 'is unsafe' traits in the prelude

[09:12] <agentzh> okay

[09:13] *** Gothmog_ joined
[09:13] <moritz_> in kp6 all unsafe functions have to check the global safety flag

[09:13] *** kane_ joined
[09:13] <agentzh> for PCR, it's harder...since the code in action blocks is not parsed by PCR itself

[09:13] <agentzh> it's merely a thin source filter

[09:13] <moritz_> you could just omit all action blocks

[09:13] <agentzh> should i disable actions completely?

[09:13] <agentzh> okay

[09:14] <agentzh> and give some informative error messages?

[09:14] <agentzh> is die okay?

[09:14] <moritz_> yes ;)

[09:14] <agentzh> there're at least 3 emitters in PCR...

[09:14] <agentzh> hopefully i don't miss any other

[09:15] <moritz_> what about a safety visitor?

[09:15] <agentzh> ratchet emitter, backtracking emitter, and the verbatim emitter

[09:15] <agentzh> visitor?

[09:15] <agentzh> visits the regex AST?

[09:15] <moritz_> like in kp6, where defferent 'visitors' change the AST

[09:15] <moritz_> right

[09:16] <agentzh> hmm

[09:16] <moritz_> and just purges all actions

[09:16] <agentzh> sounds good

[09:16] <agentzh> just need to traverse the AST myself :)

[09:16] <agentzh> there's no visitors in PCR yet

[09:16] <moritz_> recursion++

[09:16] <agentzh> (compared to kp6)

[09:17] <agentzh> heh

[09:17] <agentzh> yup, recursion can make things a lot cleaner.

[09:17] <moritz_> imagine haskell without recursion ;)

[09:17] <agentzh> heh

[09:18] <Patterner> my brain just imploded. thanks for that, moritz

[09:18] <moritz_> Patterner: you're welcome ;)

[09:20] <agentzh> moritz_: thanks for the hint; pruning AST is really nice since i can control in a central place :)

[16:22] <lambdabot> Title: The Perl Review interviews Jesse Vincent

[16:22] <moritz_> pmurias: I noticed that... the parrot folks wanted to rename their perl6 implementation at some point, but never did it

[16:23] <fglock> pmurias: it seems the name was not approved

[16:24] <obra> Patrick named his p6 "onion" a while back

[16:24] <obra> I'm not sure if the code represents that

[16:38] <pmurias> garlic is the more evil onion

[16:38] <TimToady> well, you could use some variant of onion, shallot or leek, or you could go with onion in some other language

[16:38] <[particle]> leek sounds like perl 6 without gc

[16:38] <moritz_> lol

[16:38] <TimToady> Japanese is negi, except that's green onion, and a round onion is "tamanegi"

[16:38] <TimToady> which is "ball onion"

[16:39] <pmurias> it's cebula in polish

[16:39] <moritz_> TimToady: the different kinds of onion are rather hard to grap for non-natives

[16:39] <TimToady> interesting how different languages have different unmarked forms

[16:39] <moritz_> "Zwibel" in German

[16:39] <moritz_> sorry, "Zwiebel" ;)

[16:42] *** Timm3h left

[18:16] <dlocaus> I looked over the perl5/parrot emiters and the roadmap as you suggested.  And I'm still a bit new to all this, so it's a bit more than I can handle.  Although, I'm understanding more and more...

[18:16] <dlocaus> fglock: do you have something a bit smaller that I can chew on?

[18:17] <dlocaus> fglock: I'm also finding a bit hard to keep up, seams that every morning, there is a slew of new code. :)

[18:18] <fglock> dlocaus: looking

[18:18] <fglock> dlocaus: did you try making small modifications to the parrot emitter?

[18:19] <pmurias> dlocaus: you might try getting Onion to work

[18:20] <dlocaus> fglock: part of the problem, with making small modifications  to the parrot emitter was actually understanding how perl6 worked.  It took quite a while for me to find documentation on the grammers, for which I still need to study some more.

[18:20] <dlocaus> the grammar(s) are easy to understand, the syntax is well, a bit difficult.

[18:21] <dlocaus> pmurias: what work does Onion? need?

[18:22] <fglock> dlocaus: there are some doable things in the runtime - Runtime::Perl6::* and Runtime::Perl5::*

[18:24] <pmurias> (spelling errors in commit messages)--

[18:24] <pmurias> dlocaus: Onion is kp6 compiled by itself, it's checking what dosn't work and fixing it

[18:25] <pmurias> it might be a bit hard for someone unfamiliar with kp6

[18:25] <pmurias> i added to things to the TODO which i would most like fixed

[18:25] <dlocaus> I'm looking for Runtime::PerlX::* now

[18:27] <dlocaus> fglock: when you say things are doable things in Runtime::PerlX::*, how are they identified?

[19:08] <dlocaus> what does MOP in KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MOP.pm stand for?

[19:09] *** devogon left
[19:11] *** devogon joined
[19:12] <pmurias> dlocaus: meta object protocol

[19:14] <dlocaus> pmurias: Would it be a good use of time to document all of the kp6 code?

[19:14] <dlocaus> pmurias: documenting is a good way of learning what's going on.

[19:15] <dlocaus> pmurias: perhaps some test cases as well?

[19:15] <pmurias> dlocaus: you want to document tests?

[19:16] <bbkr> which tests are most needed ATM? http://perlcabal.org/syn/ shows synopses coverage, but tells nothing about priorities in testing.

[19:16] <lambdabot> Title: Official Perl 6 Documentation

[19:16] <pmurias> dlocaus: i don't think it's worth to document stuff which will be thrown away

[19:18] <pugs_svn> r18709 | dlo++ | Documented the meaning of MOP in the filename.

[19:18] <pmurias> (things which use the mp6 runtime)

[19:19] <dlocaus> pmurias: ok

[19:21] <pmurias> bbkr: pugs isn't developed much nowdays and kp6 is not mature enough to use the pugs test suit

[19:23] <bbkr> so test suite is also frozen now (till mp6 will be mature enough?)

[19:24] <pmurias> bbkr: it's not frozen

[19:25] <pmurias> it's that i don't think that the implementations make something a priority

[19:27] *** drbean left
[19:27] <pmurias> meta-class test might be helpfull for kp6

[19:27] <bbkr> ok, thanks

[19:34] *** riffraff left
[19:38] <dlocaus> pmurias: I'm finding it a bit hard to read the DispatchSugar and other subroutines in Runtime::Perl5::DispatchSugar & MOP.  would anyone mind if I documented it?

[19:42] <pmurias> no

[19:43] <pmurias> feel free to document anything you want

[19:43] <pmurias> OTOH i would prefer if you removed Runtime::Perl5::DispatchSugar

[19:44] <dlocaus> ok, I'll document DispatchSugar and MOP to try and get a handle on what the code is doing.

[19:44] <dlocaus> then I'll see about removing DispatchSugar...

[19:44] <pmurias> nice

[19:45] <dlocaus> pmurias: I think I can bite this off.

[19:45] <pmurias> MOP is IMHO the hardest part of kp6

[19:48] <pmurias> dlocaus: DispatchSugar could be removed with a simple substitution, but make_class would be better then a lot of ::DISPATCH

[19:52] <dlocaus> pmurias: you are probably right, but I don't have enough experience with the code to see the big picture yet.  and to do .WHAT I need to be able to understand the MOP.

[19:52] <dlocaus> pmurias: I'm sure the documentation won't hurt anyone, and may make things easier for the next person :)

[19:52] *** xinming_ left
[19:54] <pmurias> dlocaus: go ahead with the documentation

[19:58] *** xinming_ joined
[19:59] <dlocaus> are you guys using any special form of notation to help find TODO items? ie: "todo:" or (todo) ?

[20:00] <pugs_svn> r18710 | dlo++ | added documentation to this code.

[20:01] <pugs_svn> r18711 | dlo++ | fixed minor formating error in documentation

[20:02] <pmurias> dlocaus: dunno

[20:03] *** xinming left
[20:05] <pmurias> dlocaus: you can introduce one

[20:07] <dlocaus> pmurias: it appears that everyone is just using "TODO" in caps. at least that is what grep -R suggests.

[20:08] <dlocaus> oh.. App::Ack is nice..

[21:33] <FreshCat> how close is perl6 anyhow?

[21:34] <Tene> FreshCat: I use Perl 6 currently.

[21:34] <Tene> So, depends on what oyu need.

[21:34] <FreshCat> so, the part that is there is deffinitely going to be present in the release version?

[21:34] <Tene> Yep.

[21:35] <FreshCat> awesome

[21:35] <FreshCat> linkage?

[21:35] <Tene> There are different projects that implement different parts of Perl 6.

[21:35] <Tene> They're all planning on meeting in the middle. :)

[21:35] <FreshCat> ah ok

[21:35] <Tene> http://pugscode.org/ is a place to start.

[21:35] <lambdabot> Title: Pugs - pugscode

[21:35] <Tene> As is http://parrotcode.org/

[21:35] <lambdabot> Title: Parrot Virtual Machine - parrotcode

[21:36] <Tene> pugs, parrot, kp6 are the big things you want to look at.

[21:36] <Tene> kp6 is being developed in the pugs repo

[21:37] <FreshCat> what is KindaPerl6

[21:37] *** xinming_ joined
[21:37] <moritz_> it's a perl6 compiler written in a subset of perl 6

[21:38] <moritz_> see http://www.pugscode.org/kp6.html for a (very) short intro

[21:38] <lambdabot> Title: kp6 - KindaPerl6

[21:41] <FreshCat> outstanding.  Thanks guys!
