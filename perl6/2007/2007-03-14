[00:07] <geoffb> Limbic_Region, [particle]: yeah, the error that Limbic_Region just demonstrated is why I went the Perl 5 eval route

[00:07] <geoffb> Really would like to get rid of that

[00:08] <geoffb> It's the only Perl 5 code not related to symbol import hell

[00:08] <[particle]> i wonder if you could wrap the symbol import into an import sub

[00:09] <geoffb> [particle]: I partially did that for the SDL::OpenGL.can code, which used to be even worse than it is now

[00:10] <geoffb> wrapped it in a loop inside a BEGIN block, that is

[00:10] <geoffb> I would love to just be able to say "import SDL::OpenGL;" and be done with it

[03:29] <ajs_> atan is confusing. What TimToady said earlier used to be correct, but the $base parameter is long since edited out of the atan(2) spec.

[03:29] *** lambdabot joined
[03:30] <ajs_> I think that as it stands now, other than a typo that lists two $y in the signature, there's no reason for an atan and atan2, since the signature of atan2 has an optional second parameter

[14:27] <lichtkind> rindolf: do you want the linux version :) :)

[14:30] <rindolf> lichtkind: I suppose I can give it a try.

[14:31] <lichtkind> glad to hear but there is some problems

[14:31] <lichtkind> i suppose you use linux

[14:32] <lichtkind> the problem is not that i packaged it only for windows because the sources are xplatform

[14:33] <lichtkind> the only problem ist that some parts are in transition and i plan it to be cpan installable

[14:33] <lichtkind> now its not

[14:33] <lichtkind> you have to set 2 pathes by hand and install the 2 modules it needs

[14:34] <lichtkind> but if thats no problem for you ypu can try

[14:34] <lichtkind> i use it on dayle base, even my perl6 article is wirtten in it

[14:34] <lichtkind> it has some nice little feature you hardly see anywhere

[14:35] <lichtkind> but that all you can read since the app and the docs are english as german as well

[14:35] <lichtkind> rindolf: any further questions? :)

[14:35] <rindolf> lichtkind: OK, where do I get it from?

[14:36] <lichtkind> all the good bugfixes are in the latest packages 

[14:36] <lichtkind> i have a special site for it

[14:36] <lichtkind> http://web52.xeon225.server4you.de

[14:36] <lichtkind> but it containes win binaries for all the stuff

[14:37] <lichtkind> shoul i strip the sources?

[14:40] <lichtkind> mom

[14:41] <lichtkind> im uploading

[14:44] <lichtkind> rindolf: the upmost downlowd is now sources only is much smaller, it needs the module Wx and Hash::Merge and look in the starter there you set pathes to where docs and configs lay

[16:06] <audreyt> our %vtable; sub gen {  %vtable = (k => { ...caller()... }) };  gen();  %vtable<k>();

[16:06] <audreyt> in that case &?ROUTINE is never in dynscope

[16:08] <audreyt> geoffb: symbol table access will be O(1) after the Pad-refactoring, which should land soon (like, this weekend)

[16:10] <audreyt> basically currently each statement in Pugs can introduce a lexical Pad; however perl6 spec has changed after that, and only blocks have pads now; so after the refactoring we know statically what symbol access is what, and can run O(1)

[16:10] <fglock> hmm - re O(1), I wonder how many problems I'd avoid if I didn't insist in premature optimization

[16:11] *** gnuvince joined
[16:12] <TimToady> audreyt: but caller(Routine,1) will not dwtm in a displaced closure block either.

[16:12] <Debolaz> "do what timtoady mean"?

[16:12] <audreyt> TimToady: point.

[16:12] <TimToady> do what "they" mean

[16:12] <Debolaz> Ah. :)

[16:12] <TimToady> would have to be context(&?BLOCK,1) for that

[16:13] <audreyt> what we really want is

[16:13] <TimToady> which is precisely the interpretation we're trying to avoid for non-displaced blocks

[16:13] <TimToady> so that control flow blocks aren't thought of as closures unless you need to

[16:14] <TimToady> so if they want that, the probably just write "sub {...caller...}"

[16:14] <audreyt> context({ .routine != &?ROUTINE })

[16:15] <audreyt> which seems to dwim more than either of the two

[16:15] <TimToady> that doesn't make sense

[16:16] <audreyt> mm? "nearest call frame that is in a different routine than the site of &caller"

[16:16] <TimToady> !===, you mean

[16:16] <devbot6> TimToady: Error: "===," is not a valid command.

[16:16] <audreyt> sure

[16:16] <TimToady> I guess I don't mean that, devbot6. :)

[16:17] <lichtkind> audreyt wow i thought you wanted sleep 

[16:17] <audreyt> I did (still do)

[16:17] <TimToady> but other than that, yes, that might work

[16:18] <lichtkind> so i speak with audrey subconsciousness

[16:18] <lichtkind> impressive

[16:18] <audreyt> TimToady: woot. do you have cycles to whack it in?

[16:18] <TimToady> sure

[16:18] <audreyt> TimToady++

[16:21] <fglock> just checking - <alpha> does a named capture, but <alpha+digit> doesn't ?

[16:22] <TimToady> hmm, we have no good notation for rewriting .caller as .context, because the test would have to talk about the invocant that we're passing in. could use a temporary, I guess

[16:23] <audreyt> or macro :)

[16:23] <audreyt> plus, that was still wrong... context({ .routine !=== &?ROUTINE }) doesn't handle recursion.

[16:23] <audreyt> the problem is the frame object should distinguish between "entering an inner block" 

[16:23] <TimToady> probably need to provide both

[16:23] <audreyt> and "all other kind of calls"

[16:24] <audreyt> for this to natively work

[16:24] <audreyt> for 

[16:24] <TimToady> "carpcaller"

[16:24] <audreyt> sub f { { die 1 } }

[16:24] <audreyt> sub f { { die 1 }() }

[16:25] <audreyt> are different; the first "die 1"'s caller is the one calling f; the second one is simply &f

[16:25] <audreyt> (if the second one look contrived, consider a vtable indirection, etc)

[16:26] <audreyt> (pugs's evaluator stores this info (enterBlock vs apply), which is why we can provide consistent &caller)

[16:27] <TimToady> so it's more like "find me a context that isn't 'inline'"

[16:27] <audreyt> we want to find the first frame that is generated with apply

[16:27] <audreyt> right.

[16:28] <TimToady> how to name it, then?

[16:28] <audreyt> context({ !.inline }) ;)

[16:28] <TimToady> not good enough

[16:28] *** vel joined
[16:28] <TimToady> you could be called from a context that thinks it's inline

[16:28] <audreyt> context({!.inline},1)

[16:29] <TimToady> might work

[16:29] <audreyt> true that

[16:29] <audreyt> the .inline info is populated by the evaluator

[16:30] <TimToady> plus it still doesn't do what the user expects on custom control vs &?ROUTINE, I think

[16:30] *** the_dormant joined
[16:30] <audreyt> so that should work: "find me the first frame that wasn't called as a inline block; then find the one after it"

[16:30] <audreyt> thought about that; I think the answer is that custom control are expected to always use .callswith

[16:31] <TimToady> not apply

[16:31] <audreyt> or some other frame-upto-caller erasure trick

[16:31] <TimToady> ok

[16:31] <audreyt> should talk about that in spec too

[16:31] <audreyt> macros of course by definition fix all this

[16:31] <audreyt> so that's another way out for customcontrol writers

[16:31] <TimToady> </handwave>

[16:31] <gaal> rhi

[16:31] <audreyt> er no, I mean a macro's dyncontext is naturally separated

[16:31] <gaal> oi, kyboar ropping hars again...

[16:32] <audreyt> so if you write statement:for as a macro, it doesn't even have a frame at runtime

[16:32] <audreyt> but yeah, a non-macro control structure should always use .callwith etc, which by definition erases frames upto caller

[16:33] <TimToady> so a tail-recursed caller is always outside the recursing func?

[16:33] <TimToady> (or however you're supposed to say that...)

[16:34] <audreyt> (...recursively...)

[16:34] <gaal> rerehi with an E

[16:34] <TimToady> you can say that again...

[16:35] <audreyt> tail recursion optimization, if present, by definition erases frames

[16:35] <audreyt> so either require implementations still provide CONTEXT info

[16:35] <audreyt> or explicitly say it's okay to not provide consistent context info, in exchange for speed, and pretend we're scheme (etc)

[16:36] <audreyt> (option 1 is saner imho.)

[16:37] <TimToady> but it would be nice to run fast

[16:37] <audreyt> then you say &?SUB.callwith

[16:37] <audreyt> we don't have a form that explicitly say callwith-then-return?

[16:37] <audreyt> pugs had &?SUB.goto for that (noncanonical)

[16:38] <audreyt> that we can unroll happily

[16:38] <audreyt> (as can &?SUB.callwith with more work)

[16:38] <TimToady> nextwith is the new gotowith

[16:39] <audreyt> ahh ok

[16:39] <[particle]> is nextto the new goto?

[16:39] *** jisom joined
[16:39] <audreyt> so yes. nextwith is the way if you really want fast tail call

[16:40] <audreyt> and you are not limited to tail position then

[16:40] <audreyt> so more general

[16:42] <TimToady> in any case callwith is probably "inline", which neatly captures it's "unofficial" frame, I suspect 

[16:42] <gaal> how do I iterate over two arrays in parallel and get the current element of each and an index? each(@x, @y, [1..*]) ?

[16:42] <audreyt> yeah. 

[16:42] <audreyt> how do we invoke a method with callwith?

[16:42] <audreyt> say I want to callwith $obj.meth(1)

[16:42] <moritz_> gaal: zip them first, then iterate?

[16:43] <gaal> was that yeah to me or to TimToady? :)

[16:44] <TimToady> each is non-spec

[16:44] <gaal> oh

[16:44] <gaal> so for (zip @x, @y).kv -> [$x, $y], $i { ... } ?

[16:44] <TimToady> &method.callwith(|\($obj: 1,2,3)) perhaps

[16:45] <audreyt> two invocants

[16:45] <audreyt> $obj.can('meth').callwith(1,2,3)

[16:45] <audreyt> is one way to do it

[16:45] <audreyt> (assume a precurrying .can in Code context)

[16:46] <TimToady> zip is now supposed to return flattened by default like each used to

[16:47] <audreyt> in perl5 I often wondered why .can does not precurry :)

[16:47] <gaal> TimToady: thanks

[16:47] <audreyt> if (my $f = $obj->can('meth')) { $f->($obj, 1, 2, 3) } # $obj is duplicated

[16:49] <TimToady> &meth.assuming($obj:) seems like it ought to work

[16:49] <gaal> conceivably you might want to call it on another object; maybe use used can just to avoid looking at the symbol table

[16:50] <audreyt> sure it ought

[16:50] <audreyt> $obj.can('meth').assuming($obj:).callwith(1,2,3)

[16:50] <audreyt> I don't know. maybe it's huffmanly correct.

[16:50] <audreyt> "if you really want to..."

[16:51] <TimToady> well, it's a normal thing for a dispatcher to want to do

[16:51] <audreyt> and why punish oo dispatchers :)

[16:51] <TimToady> to prevent people from writing their own, hopefully?

[16:52] <audreyt> ok :)

[16:52] <audreyt> (and .assuming is a fine way to do it; I'm content)

[16:53] <gaal> giving a precurried $f in perl 5 means you _can't_ call it on another invocant. presumably p6 .assuming accepts overrides!

[16:53] <TimToady> I don't think so

[16:54] *** VanilleBert left
[16:54] <TimToady> it's not just adding defaults

[16:54] <TimToady> it's rewriting the sig

[16:55] <gaal> nod, hmm you're right of course

[16:55] <TimToady> if you assume the invocant you just have a sub call

[17:03] <gaal> hmm maybe :($, $y, :$x, $z) is better but harder to moose

[17:16] <audreyt> er, bloom.

[17:16] <TimToady> boom works

[17:18] <lichtkind> TimToady yes even if i dont know the dicussion as well as you it was my thought that some might misunderstand the the concept

[17:19] <TimToady> it does point up something missing, though

[17:20] <TimToady> which is that I think maybe a loop in scalar context should default to returning its last value rather than all its loop values.

[17:20] <TimToady> using gather/take to return one item is kind of overkill

[18:29] <TimToady> snobol is powerful in sort of an "assembly language for pattern matching" sense, but predates regex culture basically.

[18:29] <specbot6> r14347 | larry++ | New "hyper" listop that is an explicitly parallelizing variant of "eager".

[18:31] <TimToady> in your first sense Perl didn't borrow anything directly from snobol, except perhaps the notion of keeping track of the current match position in a user-accessible fashion.

[18:32] <geoffb> TimToady: I know the compiler is allowed to parallelize over each hyper'ed op, but what about over an entire expression involving multiple hypers?  (e.g. @a = @b >>*<< @c >>+<< @d >>*<< @e)

[18:32] *** cognominal joined
[18:34] <geoffb> One of the performance problems I found with PDL is that if you didn't use PDL::PP, every op created, computed, and broke down a temp piddle.  This is way slower than computing the entire result all at once.

[18:35] <TimToady> all hypers are explicitly parallel

[18:35] <TimToady> so I think that's what you want

[18:36] <geoffb> TimToady: Ah, so my above expression needs no temp arrays, and will compute each element as @b[n] * @c[n] + @d[n] * @e[n] (in PDL::PPish notation)?

[20:03] <fglock> hmm, not really

[20:03] <fglock> it is mostly usable, but there is a long TODO list

[20:04] <geoffb> Where does kp6 fit into the big scheme of things?  And is it written in P5?

[20:04] <fglock> it needs better integration with Pugs (haskell-perl5) communication

[20:04] <fglock> kp6 is written in kp6 :)

[20:04] <geoffb> gotcha about status

[20:04] <geoffb> What is wrong with pugs communication at present?

[20:04] <fglock> kp6 is bootstrapped in perl5

[20:05] <fglock> but it could compile to parrot

[20:05] *** offby1` is now known as offby1

[20:05] <[particle]> some work was started on that, but never finished 

[20:05] <ayrnieu> where is kp6?

[20:05] <geoffb> So kp6 is investigating the boundary of how little is actually needed from the "vm", and how much can be done in pure p6?

[20:06] <fglock> re communication - it seems that variables inside regex aren't shared with haskell; needs some work to find out why

[20:07] <geoffb> .oO( This is part of why I'm on IRC again ... it's so hard to see the big picture when audreyt is not producing copious presentations, and all you have is the mailing lists to glean from.)

[20:07] <ayrnieu> oh, kp6 = v6.pm?

[20:07] <geoffb> fglock: ah

[20:07] <fglock> sorry, I meant "mp6" - mp6 is the "how little is needed" version

[20:07] <fglock> v6.pm == perl6-in-perl5

[20:08] <geoffb> OK, so we currently have: kp6, mp6, v6.pm, Pugs, PGE.  Does that about cover it?

[20:08] <ayrnieu> no, PGE is just the rules engine.

[20:08] <ayrnieu> you want: languages/perl6

[20:09] <geoffb> Oy.  OK, thanks ayrnieu

[20:09] <fglock> oh, we have about 4 or 5 rule engines actually

[20:09] <geoffb> So kp6 -> kp6, mp6 -> ?, v6.pm -> PCR, Pugs -> PCR, l/p6 -> PGE ...?

[20:10] <geoffb> jebus

[20:10] <geoffb> No wonder I'm lost

[20:10] <fglock> PCR itself has several internal engines, with different kinds of optimizations

[20:10] <fglock> lets see..

[20:11] <[particle]> this merits visiolization

[20:11] <fglock> the main projects are Perl6/Haskell and Perl6/Parrot

[20:11] <geoffb> [particle]: hell yes.

[20:11] *** vel joined
[20:11] <fglock> these projects aim to a complete implementation of the spec

[20:12] <fglock> Perl6/Perl5 implements a reasonable subset of the language

[20:12] <geoffb> (I assume P6/P5 won't implement everything because ... oh, you beat me to it.)

[20:13] <geoffb> Making sense so far.

[20:13] <fglock> then, there is Perl6-on-Perl6

[20:13] <ayrnieu> that being the ultimate, holy goal.

[20:14] <fglock> there are several small pieces of p6-p6 all around

[20:14] * geoffb hears a choir sing ....

[20:14] *** cognominal joined
[20:14] <fglock> TimToady's STD is a p6 grammar; pmichaud also did a p6 grammar;

[20:15] <fglock> PCR is partially written in p6

[20:15] *** kunwon1 joined
[20:15] <fglock> and mp6 implements a working (but limited) p6-on-p6

[20:15] <moritz_> this is partly confusing ;)

[20:15] <geoffb> PCR is a P5 module written partially in P6?  Using v6.pm?

[20:15] <fglock> yes

[20:15] <geoffb> wow, cool.  OK, go on

[20:16] <fglock> v6.pm was bootstrapped about an year ago, with a mini compiler named "lrep"

[20:16] <fglock> which is reverse-"perl"

[20:16] <geoffb> (as an aside, I'm really interested in P6-on-P5, even without all the shiny semantic features, because I like the P6 syntax so much)

[20:16] <geoffb> heh

[20:17] <fglock> lrep was then split into PCR (the regex engine), and v6.pm (the perl6 compiler)

[20:18] <fglock> Pugs now uses PCR through a haskell-perl5 bridge

[20:18] <geoffb> fglock: OK, I think I understand

[20:19] <fglock> that's it for the main projects, but then we have many small projects

[20:19] <fglock> mp6 is a completely self-contained bootstrapped compiler

[20:19] <geoffb> So why kp6 and mp6?  Why were they not just improvements on v6?

[20:20] <fglock> mp6 can theoretically be boottrapped in almost any vm/language

[20:20] <geoffb> "Supply these n primative ops, and you're set"?

[20:21] <fglock> but the compiler internals are too simple for the necessary AST transformations that Parrot (for example) requires

[20:21] <fglock> yes

[20:21] <geoffb> ah

[20:22] <fglock> it is a more complex compiler, written in mp6

[20:22] <fglock> s/^/kp6 /

[20:23] <fglock> kp6 implements "plugins" for almost all internal operations

[20:23] <geoffb> OK, so mp6 is written in mp6, bootstrapped some ago in P5 I assume, then kp6 was written in mp6, providing more complexity with the goal of ... being able to target Parrot?

[20:23] <meppl> good night

[20:23] <geoffb> g'night, meppl

[20:24] <geoffb> Is mp6 complete enough that it's not needing to change to support new kp6 features?

[20:24] <fglock> yes; kp6 can also provide a more feature-complete p6-on-p5

[21:14] <geoffb> cannoneers from the opposing army?  Oh wait, mixing time periods there ....

[21:15] <geoffb> Maybe gravity is the ultimate test case.  :-)

[21:15] <moritz_> ;)

[21:15] <moritz_> and "make smoke" is an earth quake ;)
