[00:17] <Tene> problems on feather of some unspecified nature

[00:17] <DarkWolf84> the server

[00:17] <DarkWolf84> today is server down day

[00:17] <Tene> Yes.  I can bring an evalbot in for you if you need it for something.

[00:17] <DarkWolf84> :)

[00:18] <DarkWolf84> no

[00:33] <DarkWolf84> bug?

[00:34] <Tene> Looks like pugs is trying to parse strict.pm somehow

[00:34] <Tene> perl5's strict.pm, that is

[00:35] <TimToady> do you pull in strict with an env var somehow?

[00:35] <Tene> This should be a pretty standard perl setup.  I haven't done anything tricky that I'm aware of.

[00:36] <Tene> nothing perl-related in my env.

[00:38] <Tene> Hmm.  Looks like 'make install' has screwed up my perl installation somehow.  Trying to use any modules in perl5 results in death trying to locate v6.pm.

[00:38] <TimToady> in any case strict.pm starts with "package" so pugs ought to treat it as perl 5 code...

[00:40] <TimToady> I realize it's a lame answer over the long term, but most of us never do make install

[00:40] <Tene> It's always worked fine on my other boxes, so I never thought anything of it.

[00:40] * Tene shrugs.

[00:41] <TimToady> it's one of those things like GC bugs, it doesn't tend to bite you till after the damage is done.

[00:41] <Tene> Yeah.

[00:42] <DarkWolf84> like let and temp types 

[00:43] <TimToady> what are let and temp types?

[00:44] <TimToady> let and temp are just functions on an lvalue, not declarations...

[00:44] <DarkWolf84> temporary and hypothetic vars

[00:45] <DarkWolf84> but when i try to use let i get no such subroutine

[00:46] <TimToady> the type of such a variable is orthogonal to let or temp

[00:46] <TimToady> that's because it's not implemented in pugs, I think

[00:46] <TimToady> all the temp and let tests in the smokes fail

[00:46] <DarkWolf84> some people reported that last versions did it

[00:47] <TimToady> hmm, but probably by parsing as declarations, which was bogus

[00:47] <Tene> Looks like a bunch of stuff installed in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/ on this box instead of /usr/lib/perl6/site_perl/ like on my other boxes.

[00:49] <DarkWolf84> not last, previous versions

[00:50] <DarkWolf84> I'm getting sleep and type stupid things

[00:52] <DarkWolf84> maybe I have to go to bed

[00:52] <geoffb> Interesting how "getting sleep" and "getting sleepy" mean such different things

[00:53] <DarkWolf84> sry my english is bad

[00:55] <avar> My english is oh so naughty

[00:56] <DarkWolf84> many english will laugh when i write such things

[05:46] <dduncan> question ... if I'm reading the latest synopsis updates right, it seems that one can define their own .defined method for their class, and so if I had a class with a protoobject defined, I could make it that .defined always returns true on $foo just after declaring my Bar $foo;

[05:47] <dduncan> which is useful if Bar is a class for values and it has no concept of undefinedness

[05:48] <dduncan> but does have a default defined value

[05:48] <dduncan> then users doing .defined tests, the right thing will still happen

[14:42] <masak> what's been written in the way of XML parsers and XPath engines in Perl6? does anyone know if there's such code in the pugs repository

[14:42] <masak> I took a quick look in ext/ but didn't find anything

[14:42] <masak> I think that Perl6 and XPath would be an especially sweet match

[14:43] <masak> oh, and Perl6 grammar capabilities match sweetly with XML validation, too

[14:48] <integral> err, why not just embed libxslt/libxml like the perl5 modules?  They both support callbacks to perl code for XPath functions and things

[14:49] *** sunnavy_ joined
[14:51] <masak> integral: yes, that sounds like a good idea. so my question becomes, has anyone done this? embedded libxslt and provided an attractive Perl6 API?

[14:51] <integral> afaik we don't have an implementation of a Perl6->C FFI/XS/NCI thing yet, so no

[14:52] <integral> What would be nice for a NCI (I guess) would be a p6 grammar for parsing C header files

[14:54] <masak> hmm

[14:54] <masak> so, a subset of C syntax?

[14:55] <integral> sure

[14:56] *** mdiep joined
[14:57] <masak> is that subset well-documented and easy to comprehend, or would this also require thinking long and hard about what exactly one might come upon in a C header file?

[14:57] * masak doesn't really have firm experience in C

[14:59] <integral> TBH I'd just implement a reasonably complete C grammar.  It doesn't seem to be that big judging by small compilers like TCC

[15:00] <masak> integral: ah, ok

[15:03] <ayrnieu> C header files are not a separate language.  They are simply C, with contents by convention.

[15:04] *** the_dormant joined
[15:07] *** pkundu joined
[15:10] <masak> ayrnieu: right. however, maybe a full C grammar isn't necessary if we're only interested in sub signatures or some such

[22:44] <TimToady> anyone know why the smoker is misreporting elapsed times?  I thought maybe it was because my YAML::Syck was old, but after upgrading it still reports 0.45 min when it took 27.73 minutes according to the header.
