[06:56] <TimToady> that example works, by the way.

[06:58] <TimToady> doesn't do anything with captures yet though

[06:58] <TimToady> so still kinda useless for a real grammar

[15:19] <masak> how would I implement haskell's List.group in Perl 6?

[15:20] <masak> I just tried it in Perl 5, and couldn't really think of any natural way to do it

[15:20] <wolverian> reduce 

[15:20] <masak> wolverian: please elaborate

[15:20] <wolverian> think how you'd write it with foldl in haskell

[15:20] <wolverian> (or look at the definition)

[15:20] <moritz_> like $string.comb: rx/(.)$0*/; for lists?

[15:21] <wolverian> or just recursion

[15:21] <wolverian> hm. do we have span? 

[15:23] <masak> what is it?

[15:23] * masak is just learning haskell

[15:23] <masak> I also found it in the definition of groupBy

[15:23] <wolverian> you can look it up with hoogle

[15:24] <wolverian> it splits the list in two based on a predicate

[15:24] <masak> wolverian: can I get to the source with hoogle?

[15:24] <masak> I didn't see an easy way to do that, maybe I missed it

[15:24] <wolverian> on the documentation page, 'source code' at the top right

[15:25] <masak> thx

[15:25] <wolverian> it just doesn't give you the source to a particular function, only to the whole module. unfortunately

[15:26] <masak> wolverian: I grepped that source file, and didn't find a definition...

[15:26] <wolverian> oh, of span? it's probably imported from GHC.List

[15:26] <masak> ok

[15:27] <wolverian> you can also look at the haskell98 standard prelude, which I think defines all these 

[15:27] <wolverian> so that you don't have to dig up ghc's implementation from svn or anything :)

[15:27] <masak> good.

[15:28] <masak> ah -- found it

[15:29] * masak is really starting to appreciate Haskell

[15:29] <masak> today I found myself longing for the 'where' keyword in Perl

[15:29] <wolverian> :)

[15:30] <masak> if no-one else makes that a 6PAN module, I will

[15:31] *** barney joined
[15:32] <moritz_> do that, please ;)

[15:38] <lambdabot> audreyt is in #perl6 and #haskell. I don't know when audreyt last spoke.

[15:39] <gnuvince> I'm guessing she still has electricity

[15:40] <masak> gnuvince: is there a context to that guess? I don't understand

[15:40] <masak> gnuvince: ah, ok

[15:40] <masak> she's on IRC, thus she has electricity

[16:39] <TimToady> a lysdexic is a greek with a broken right hand...

[16:40] * masak laughs

[16:40] <masak> just the other day I thought of calling myself Dexter because it sounded right

[16:41] <TimToady> but your laugh is Sinister

[16:41] <masak> most likely

[16:41] <masak> the direction Left has a bad rep through history

[16:42] <diakopter> hee hee

[16:43] <masak> & # food

[16:43] <lysdexsik> if it was the bad direction i should perhaps /nick lysdexsick ;)

[16:44] <daxim_> I got this between the &apos; quotes from the perl 6 now video on google:

[16:44] <daxim_> $ pugs -e'for each(1..*; =<>) {say "Line $^num: $^text";}' < somefilename

[16:44] <daxim_> but:  *** Cannot bind to non-existing variable: "$num" at -e line 1, column 1

[16:47] * Tene suddenly understands masak's pun and laughs more than he probably should while in front of the class.

[16:48] <lysdexsik> but, as TimToady is a linguist he already know that Lys is the flower that symbolize France, Dex is an astronomical measure, and sik (originally Sikh) is a practitioner of an ancient indian religion. Thus the conclusion of all this is that my nick means the original distance between France and India divided several times by the tail length of your average cat is phi!

[16:48] <TimToady> daxim_: eventually that kind of each() is going away, and you'll just use zip(), or 1..* Z =<>

[16:49] <daxim_> aha

[16:49] <TimToady> lysdexsik: I knew that...

[16:49] <lysdexsik> there's no doubt about it ;)

[16:49] <TimToady> that's why an above-average cat is called phi phi

[16:51] <TimToady> I guess by that reasoning a below-average cat is just called

[16:52] * gnuvince has two tattoos: pi on the left arm and phi on the right

[16:52] *** masak left
[16:52] <gnuvince> What does that make me?

[16:53] <TimToady> confused

[16:53] <lysdexsik> yeah, or FE (FEA originally for Finite element analysis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_analysis) and lix (59, not the answer to life and everything http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIX) so the just above cat average may also be called Felix

[16:53] <lambdabot> Title: Finite element analysis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[16:56] <TimToady> I'm not 59 yet, so I guess that makes me prolix

[16:56] <[particle]> gnuvince: i guess it makes you (pi + phi) / pi or about 2.3798

[16:57] <[particle]> (pi + phi)/2 that is

[16:57] <TimToady> pi and 2 aren't all that far apart

[16:57] <TimToady> 'bout 1 apart, I make it

[16:57] <[particle]> ...for large values of one

[16:57] <TimToady> and as we all know, when you divide by 1 it makes no difference

[16:59] <TimToady> hmm, SA means both "left" and "difference" in Japanese

[16:59] <lysdexsik> one must notice that's the at the very beginning of the musical area the the human history that people first "heard" of  phi, for high values of phi, it was thus called hi-fi...

[17:00] <lysdexsik> s/the the/in the/

[17:00] <TimToady> but who was St. Ereo?

[17:00] <moritz_> he invented the oreo cookies

[17:00] <TimToady> must of been dyslexic

[17:00] <moritz_> somehow the name got mangled

[17:17] <TimToady> well, I'm probably www-data

[17:18] <TimToady> that's what commitbit runs as

[17:18] <moritz_> fridim: so what are you good at? perl? perl6? haskell? C? english?

[17:18] <daxim_> what is marty pauley's dialect of english called?

[17:19] <TimToady> what is sslh?

[17:19] <fridim> I know a bit of C (how could we say this another way?), and perl

[17:19] <TimToady> lysdexsik: okay, commitbit on its way

[17:20] <TimToady> it is customary to add one's name to AUTHORS as one's first checking to make sure things work

[17:20] <fridim> moritz_, and I'am french

[17:20] <moritz_> fridim: diakopter++ suggested to write evalbots for kp6 and p6-on-parrot, and maybe combine them with the pugs svn bot...

[17:21] <moritz_> fridim: maybe you want to do a bit of work in that direction?

[17:21] <DarkWolf84> goodidea

[17:21] <TimToady> fridim: do you have a commit bit?

[17:21] <moritz_> fridim: or you could learn perl 6, and write more tests

[17:22] <fridim> TimToady, no.

[17:22] <moritz_> then /msg TimToady your email address

[17:23] <fridim> ok.

[17:24] <lysdexsik> thanks a lot for the commitbit :)

[17:25] <TimToady> fridim: use "fridim" for your svn id?

[17:25] <fridim> Yes, writing perl6 code to provide more test sounds good to me :)

[17:25] <fridim> TimToady, yep

[17:27] <TimToady> I don't think sslh should be looping

[17:27] <TimToady> I've reniced it

[17:27] <moritz_> fridim: or porting p5 modules to p6 might be fun as well

[17:27] <fridim> indeed

[17:27] <TimToady> but someone who knows what they're doing should probably glare at it

[17:27] <moritz_> especially if they don't do much low level stuff (pugs is not so good with that)

[17:28] <TimToady> fridim: commitbit sent

[17:28] <[particle]> sheesh, TimToady, you're turning into an ambassador for perl or something...

[17:28] <[particle]> when did that happen?

[17:36] <TimToady> oh, 'bout onescore and zero years ago.

[17:39] <[particle]>  

[17:39] <TimToady> that goes without saying

[17:40] <[particle]> it should have been left unsaid

[17:40] <TimToady> you can say that again

[17:40] <fridim> Ok, commitbit works just fine

[17:44] <Juerd> TimToady: You can probably reach feather now

[17:44] <Juerd> TimToady: Could you please try and let me know?

[17:44] <TimToady> yes, I've been handing out commitbits like candy

[17:44] <Juerd> [particle]: And as for your network, I have no idea - please let me know

[17:45] <[particle]> Juerd: working now!

[17:45] <TimToady> Juerd++

[17:45] <TimToady> do you know whether sslh should be looping?

[17:45] <TimToady> I reniced it, but I expect it's probably hung

[17:45] <Juerd> Neat

[17:46] <Juerd> sslh is `supervise`d

[17:46] <Juerd> So it restarts if it's killed, after a 1 sec delay

[17:46] <TimToady> that's good to know

[17:46] <Juerd> I'm seriously considering removing sslh altogether. It's nice, but for some reason hogs resources, and nobody seems to have tuits to fix it.

[17:47] <Juerd> And I'm still waiting for TPF's money to upgrade feather

[18:42] <moritz_> I assume the IO::DIR class will define a close() method as well

[18:44] <lysdexsik> moritz_, so i can safely modify:

[18:44] <lysdexsik> # L<S16/"Filehandles, files, and directories"/"closedir">

[18:44] <lysdexsik> into:

[18:45] <lysdexsik> # L<S16/"Filehandles, files, and directories"/"IO::DIR::close">

[18:45] <moritz_> sorry, it's Dir, not DIR

[18:45] <moritz_> and since it doesn't exist yet, mark it with an XXX and point it to IO::Dir::open for so long

[18:46] <moritz_> that's not entirely correct, but it's not a broken link at least

[18:46] <lysdexsik> ok, i know it sounds stupid, but where do i put the XXX before the smartlinks in a comment?

[18:47] <moritz_> yes

[18:47] <lysdexsik> ok

[18:47] <moritz_> or after it

[18:47] <lysdexsik> thanks

[19:11] <pugs_svnbot> r17261 | moritz++ | t/syntax/comments.t: fixed one of two broken smartlinks

[19:11] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17261 - Pugs - Trac

[19:13] <[particle]> is there a one-line pod comment in perl 6?

[19:13] <moritz_> not that I know of

[19:13] <[particle]> too bad :(

[19:14] <moritz_> why?

[19:14] <[particle]> we could use it for smartlinks

[19:14] <[particle]> i expect the smartlink syntax will change

[19:14] <[particle]> i wonder what it will change to

[19:15] <[particle]> needs to be compact and simple, like now

[19:15] <[particle]> but valid perl 6 pod would be nice

[19:16] <diakopter> [particle]: I thought perl 6 pod was now quite up in the air, pending any messages on perl6.language since the "I'm blocking this thread indefinitely" message from Damian?

[19:16] <[particle]> diakopter: i don't expect a complete syntax rewrite

[19:17] <[particle]> honestly, i haven't followed that thread. it got way too deep for my attention

[19:17] <moritz_> daxim++ # ASCII-Art in t/README

[19:18] <diakopter> [particle]: ironically for you, one-line comments/pod were at the heart of the thread.

[19:18] <[particle]> excellent!

[19:20] <daxim_> I also uploaded a new smoke, r17259/snapshot/linux

[19:23] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17262 - Pugs - Trac

[19:36] <yoghourth> i'm looking at the smartlink in t/syntax/comments.t: line 128: pattern "always a line-end comment" (# L<S02/"Whitespace and Comments"/"always a line-end comment">)... it's quite strange, because if the smartlink is "a line-end comment" it matches, but with the word "always" before it doesn't yet it's in S02.html and it doesnt even look special when i look at the html source...?!

[19:36] <diakopter> yoghourth: probably an encoding discrepancy..

[19:37] <yoghourth> diakopter, can you tell me where the S02.html comes from, so i can check?

[20:38] <lysdexsik> but thanks for your help :)

[20:40] <[particle]> no, thank you! if i weren't lazy and incompetent, i'd have finished implementing perl 6 by now. you're doing a good job of picking up my slack.

[20:46] <lysdexsik> count on me to always find the weird stuff that have those weird effects on the world you're trying to design, if we would live in The Matrix, nobody would call me Neo, nor the Oracle, but there's chances that they would all see 59 times the same cat moving around in the same way again and again... for one thing i hope you're lazy, but you're far from incompetent ;) thanks for your help !

[20:47] <lysdexsik> it's my first day with a commit-bit and subversion (and even participating on an open souce project), i have some questions, i'll split them:

[20:47] <lysdexsik> 1) i notified all my changes in code with comments including the string "[lysdexsik]" (i'm used to that so it's easy to retrieve changes), i suppose it's unnecessary, so i'll remove them if it is the common use here.

[20:47] <lysdexsik> 2) using ./pugs/util/smartlinks.pl --check /*/*.t t/*/*/*.t, it looks like i've brought down 8 broken link with 0 broken links. I know it's small, but it's a start anyway... how do i commit?

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: svn commit --username lysdexsik

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> :)

[20:48] <lysdexsik> and it's not to commit [lysdexsik] changes, you all helped me here

[20:49] <lysdexsik> thoughtpolice, is there a way i can check what are the changes between local files and the repository ones?

[20:49] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: svn diff

[20:49] <lysdexsik> svn: Can't open file '.svn/entries': No such file or directory

[20:50] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: hm :/ i don't work with subversion too much, but you're in the top-most level of the source tree?

[20:50] <lysdexsik> yes

[20:51] <lysdexsik> in the directory i run the svn checkout

[20:51] <[particle]> svn info

[20:51] <lysdexsik> svn: '.' is not a working copy

[20:52] <[particle]> well there you go. something go boom with your working copy

[20:52] <diakopter> inside /pugs

[20:52] <diakopter> pugs/ I mean

[20:52] <lysdexsik> ah ok

[20:52] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: if you ran svn checkout in /usr/src to download the source to pugs/, you must be inside pugs/

[20:52] <diakopter> svn info pugs

[20:52] <lysdexsik> ok it works inside pugs

[20:52] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: also before you commit make sure you won't cause issues by first running update,

[20:52] <diakopter> lysdexsik: what's your svn username?

[20:52] <[particle]> great, now you can svn diff (or svn st to list filenames)

[20:52] <lysdexsik> lysdexsik

[20:53] <diakopter> ok

[20:53] <lysdexsik> diakopter, lysdexsik TimToady gave that to me today 

[20:53] <diakopter> excellent; great

[20:53] <lysdexsik> :)

[20:53] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: while you're inside the pugs tree/ you can commit by just running svn commit --username lysdexsik 

[20:54] <thoughtpolice> and giving your password

[20:54] <thoughtpolice> also, since you'll be working with subversion a bit, I recommend you read through some of this:

[20:54] <thoughtpolice> http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

[20:54] <lambdabot> Title: Version Control with Subversion

[20:54] <lysdexsik> well i dont want yet

[20:54] <lysdexsik> i'm used to add [username] to each line i modify (in comment before or after), i guess those line are unecessary?

[20:55] <diakopter> yes; subversion stores that information elsewhere...

[20:56] <diakopter> (so don't duplicate it) :)

[20:56] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: yes, generally version control systems are quite aware of who did what change, so you don't necessarily need to duplicate such info.

[20:57] <[particle]> however specifying *why* you made the change is important

[20:57] *** REPLeffect left
[20:57] <[particle]> use -m "foo" for that

[20:58] <thoughtpolice> lysdexsik: like I said you'll be working with subversion a bit so I recommend reading that link I posted above, it's a good free introduction to subversion and you can get the basic tenets down pretty quickly. :)

[22:33] <Tene> lysdexsik: (foo => "bar")

[22:33] <lysdexsik> Tene, ok thanks

[22:34] <[particle]> lysdexsik: the third section in smartlink is keywords

[22:34] <[particle]> so it's looking for /.*Pair.*\Qone-element mapping\E.*/ in the Immutable Types section

[22:36] <lysdexsik> [particle], yes but grepping for /one-element/ doesn't bring any results

[22:41] <lysdexsik> and if i look at the text shown for "Immutable Types", and at the test file (t/var/passing_the_pair_class_to_a_sub.t) what does it match? Mapping or Set/Bag? i'm not even sure it shoudl link it to that because there's no explainations for whaat we're testing there....?

[22:41] <lysdexsik> srory for the bad english

[22:42] <lysdexsik> damn, s/srory/sorry/!

[22:42] <[particle]> yep, agreed. the comment below the smartlinks says as much

[22:42] <lysdexsik> perhaps i can leave it like that

[22:43] <lysdexsik> in fact TimToady asked me to have a look at the smartlinks and do something about them

[22:43] <lysdexsik> i didn't knew what so i first tried fixing those

[22:44] <lysdexsik> it's the first time i do something for an opensource project

[22:45] <lysdexsik> may be some can suggest something i can do, i have 8 hours left of free time

[22:46] <[particle]> well, there are plenty of tests that don't have smartlinks

[22:46] <[particle]> adding them where appropriate would be quite helpful

[22:47] <lysdexsik> that's what TimToady told me, but i dont know well enough the synopsis to do something usefull

[22:47] <[particle]> ah, i see.

[22:47] <lysdexsik> if i could make a script to do something, or eventually just make spelling/grammar corrections on the files

[22:48] <lysdexsik> i will be great for the following hours, tomorrow, i'll be off ;)

[22:48] * [particle] wonders if there's a perltidyrc file that could be applied to pugs perl 5 source

[22:48] <lysdexsik> probably for over 6 weeks ;)

[22:49] <lysdexsik> [particle], how do i do that?

[22:50] <lysdexsik> find all the perl file, apply perltidy, and test... but how?

[22:51] <[particle]> well, i'm not sure there are coding standards here

[22:52] <[particle]> or that a .perltidyrc file exists that folks have used before

[22:53] <[particle]> i have some familiarity with pugs, but i'm mostly a parrot developer

[22:53] <[particle]> our standards for committers are higher ;)

[22:54] <[particle]> however, we have many fewer committers because of it :)

[22:54] <[particle]> i believe there's more than one TODO file laying around in the pugs repo

[22:55] <[particle]> also, there's trac.pugscode.org iirc which may have some tickets to work on

[22:59] *** poky left
[23:04] <lysdexsik> [particle], well i'm a very newbie at this, so it's better i don't touch sensitive stuff... the pugs TODO is non-existent (but grepping thru the directory tree yield over 8700 results...), though there's refenreces to perltidy in the source code, there's no perltidyrc (but i'll share my config with anyone who asks) 

[23:05] <lysdexsik> if there's anyone with an idea, or a suggestion about what to do next, i'm open

[23:05] <[particle]> how about adding a perltidyrc file to the repo, and a way to run it on the source.

[23:05] <[particle]> if folks don't like the format, they can change it and rerun

[23:06] <lysdexsik> try it

[23:06] <SamB> how do you avoid the superfluous commits this would cause?

[23:07] <[particle]> you don't

[23:07] <[particle]> either periodic cleanups, or proactive developers, or both

[23:08] <[particle]> that's how parrot does it with our coding standards

[23:08] <SamB> oh, I see what you mean now

[23:08] <[particle]> plus, we have tests that make sure coding standards are being followed. so if developers run 'make test' before a commit, their source should pass the codingstd tests

[23:08] <lysdexsik> [particle], well i don't see HOW?

[23:09] <SamB> probably there aren't any coding standards yet?

[23:09] *** DarkWolf84 left
[23:10] <lysdexsik> even here, when we use RCS changing perltidy, means creating a new branch 2.0.1.1 and testing, then overwritting into 2.1

[23:11] <[particle]> just run perltidy in your working copy, and commit

[23:11] <[particle]> as long as you don't mix functional changes with it

[23:11] *** cmarcelo left
[23:11] <SamB> so probably you should really make a fresh working copy...

[23:12] <lysdexsik> ok, i dont know for svn

[23:12] <[particle]> sure, or run svn status --no-ignore

[23:12] <[particle]> that'll tell you if you have any files that shouldn't be there, or have been modified

[23:13] <[particle]> well, if they're marked with I it means they're ignored by svn

[23:13] <lysdexsik> but i frequently run perltidy on the stuff we're coding for (medium business apps) and i'm recently running perl's best practice

[23:13] <lysdexsik> (but it sucks a lot)

[23:15] <lysdexsik> and when i mean medium business apps, it means there's 3 developers going near the gobi desert in tents with laptops for the next month and a half...

[23:16] <lysdexsik> thinking about that i loose time

[23:16] <lysdexsik> what can i do

[23:39] * diakopter still thinks

[23:40] <diakopter> lysdexsik: you're a perl user.  what do you use it for?

[23:40] <obra> [particle]: I'd probably say picking a simple parrot ticket and going after it. or maybe writing tests for a synopsis that has bad coverage

[23:40] <obra> more tests is always wonderful

[23:54] <lysdexsik> ingy: i'm starting an old computer here

[23:55] <lysdexsik> ingy, i had a probelm with yaml re-indenting sutff (you read a yaml file and write it again, the file change each time)

[23:56] <ingy> well that stands to reason

[23:56] <lysdexsik> ?

[23:56] <ingy> there are million ways to yaml encode any given data

[23:57] <ingy> but it will always write in only one way

[23:58] <ingy> well maybe not a million, but more than one

[23:59] <ingy> I assume you are saying that when you Load some given YAML and Dump it again it changes

[23:59] <ingy> then again it should only change to the canonical form once
