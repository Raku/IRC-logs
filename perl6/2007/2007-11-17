[13:12] <ggoebel> Any reason not to add Coro to the PREREQ_PM hash in Makefile.PL?

[13:12] <pmurias> it's an optional dependency

[13:14] <ggoebel> then shouldn't we skip 02-gather if Coro isn't installed?

[13:14] <pmurias> yes

[13:19] <pmurias> we should skip

[13:21] <ggoebel> I'll look into it... never done tests which were optional on a module being installed.

[15:43] <ggoebel> hmm... why would you say Coro.pm is optional if perl5 is the default backend for testing?

[15:44] <ggoebel> I'm scratching my head on how to have a kp6 test be skipped if the underlying backend doesn't have a module dependency installed...

[15:44] <ggoebel> It would seem a little draconian to skip the whole test suite...

[16:00] <andara> I have patched Pugs for compilation with GHC 6.8.1. However, the changes break the 6.6.1 build. So do we stick with 6.6.1 or upgrade to 6.8.1?

[16:08] *** andara joined
[16:12] <perlmonkey2> When someone talks about "stubs" generated by a library, what are they talking about?  The API?

[16:12] <Patterner> Usually it's a small piece of code that just adjusts parameters and forwards to a library or kernel functions.

[16:13] <perlmonkey2> whups, wrong channel, but thanks Patterner :)

[16:14] <Patterner> Which would've been the right channel? #stubs? :)

[16:15] <perlmonkey2> Hah, usually I ask dorky question on #perl.  This channel always seemed to be full of very important work that shouldn't be bothered.

[23:05] <ggoebel> cyberpass2: The problem lies with the "people talking about it".  Would you like a commit bit? There are people doing it. But not enough of them. There are 3 implementations in various states of development. If you're impatient for perl6 to arrive, stop talking and do something. Find some task that needs doing and do it. Then lather, rinse, and repeat.
