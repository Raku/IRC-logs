[04:42] <avar> audreyt: do you know how to get %^H at the xs level?

[04:42] <audreyt> PL_hints surely?

[04:43] <avar> didn't know of that, I was trying to get_hv("^H"

[04:44] <audreyt> ah. no.

[04:44] <avar> PL_hints is $^H no?

[04:45] <audreyt> wait... what are you going to do?

[04:45] <audreyt> PL_compiling.cop_hints_hash ?

[04:46] <TimToady> interestingly, parrot also wants to be async underneath.

[04:46] <audreyt> the "get a hint" idiom is

[04:46] <audreyt> Perl_refcounted_he_fetch(aTHX_ PL_compiling.cop_hints_hash, 0, "open", 4, 0, 0)

[04:46] <audreyt> TimToady: yeah, but events are perthread least I heard

[04:46] <avar> lexical imports in re::engine::Plugin don't work because I don't use %^H for sub callback lookup yet

[04:46] <avar> peeking at cop_hints_vars

[04:47] <TimToady> well, at least they profess to want continuations

[04:48] <TimToady> and we can probably emulate the whole lower layer with a single event-driven thread, I expect

[04:48] <TimToady> though perhaps not get multi-cpu benefit there

[04:49] <TimToady> well, that's for later

[04:49] <audreyt> yup.

[04:49] <TimToady> and hopefully someone else.  :)

[04:49] <audreyt> so do you think it's sane to simply have

[04:49] <audreyt> async {} # share everything in scope

[04:50] <audreyt> fork {} # share nothing in scope

[04:50] <audreyt> (except for those marked "is shared")

[04:50] <audreyt> ?

[04:50] <TimToady> and ==> implies fork?

[04:50] <audreyt> which ==> is that?

[04:50] <TimToady> feed operators / pipes

[04:51] <audreyt> I thought ==> carries no parallelism promises

[04:51] <TimToady> the forgotten 3rd member of the parallism triumvirate

[04:51] <TimToady> it's a pipe

[04:51] <audreyt> I thought 

[04:51] <audreyt> @data ==> grep {...};

[04:51] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[04:51] <audreyt> is just sugar for

[04:51] <audreyt> grep {...}, @data

[04:52] <audreyt> and has no special parallelism semantics

[04:52] <audreyt> oh that changed.

[04:52] <audreyt> ok, hm.

[04:53] <TimToady> S06:848

[04:53] <TimToady> ==> and <== now delimit statements

[04:53] <audreyt> I think it's erlangish enough that we want share nothing.

[04:54] <audreyt> i.e. process parallelism, not threaded parallelism

[04:54] <audreyt> conceptually, unix pipes

[04:54] <TimToady> Cell arch

[04:54] <audreyt> yeah.

[04:54] <audreyt> if so then maybe fork{} is not needed

[04:54] <audreyt> fork() can just remain os-level fork

[04:54] <audreyt> "heavyweight fork"

[04:55] <TimToady> I think it would be confusing to use fork for internal

[04:55] <TimToady> for the Unixheads

[04:55] <audreyt> aye aye.

[04:55] <TimToady> Q: one end or the other of ==> is rooted in the current space

[04:55] <TimToady> maybe both in certain circumstances?

[04:55] <avar> audreyt: http://sial.org/pbot/22922 <- this is what I'm trying to do

[04:55] <lambdabot> Title: Paste #22922 from Someone at 85.197.228.236

[04:55] <audreyt> current space is consumer 

[04:56] <audreyt> that's standard I think

[04:56] <TimToady> but you'd kind like to loop it

[04:56] <audreyt> example?

[04:56] <TimToady> maybe as long as you feed it something lazy 

[04:56] <avar> I'e getting a HV* for %^H in XS for re::engine::Plugin lexical import

[04:56] <TimToady> 1..* ==> filter ==> @result

[04:56] <audreyt> TimToady: lazy structures does that implicitly

[04:56] <audreyt> it's called, I believe, fusion

[04:57] <audreyt> so the filter cannot write to result?

[04:57] <TimToady> anyway, I'm tired of answering the question of why we can't have two-ended pipelines

[04:58] <TimToady> no, I'd like to feed it from my current space and retrieve the result back.

[04:58] <TimToady> as long as it's all "pull" semantics, should be okay, I think

[04:58] <TimToady> and as long as the user promises

[04:58] <audreyt> my @result; 1..* ==> grep { @result.push(...); ... } ==> @result;

[04:58] <TimToady> that the feeder doesn't depend on the result

[04:58] <audreyt> what's the semantic here?

[04:58] <audreyt> the .push is noop?

[04:58] <audreyt> or rather, process-local?

[04:58] <audreyt> that is, doesn't affect the @result at the end?

[04:59] <TimToady> not sure what's sane there, but I'm not against enforcing some discipline on ==> if necessary

[04:59] <audreyt> I think anything it closes over gets cloned

[04:59] <audreyt> and it remains local absolutely

[04:59] <audreyt> aka erlang

[04:59] <audreyt> only sane model I'm aware of

[05:00] <TimToady> well, let's plan to stay sane

[05:00] <avar> audreyt: http://simnet.is/boaesd/re-engine-Plugin-0.01.tar.gz # if you want to take a look

[05:00] <TimToady> can maybe loosen up later

[05:00] <audreyt> it also means we don't get those ithread pains

[05:00] <audreyt> since the amount of freevar is encouraged to be small 

[05:00] <audreyt> OUTER var that is

[05:00] <audreyt> and as long as it's small there's no cost

[05:00] <avar> audreyt: the up-to-date example is t/methods.t. But It's not cpan-ready until I can at least get lexical imports to work

[05:01] <avar> I'm not exepecting an answer back to these mublings b.t.w:)

[05:01] <TimToady> ==> stuff is more for event layer than for thread layer

[05:01] <audreyt> sure, which is why explicit sharing is good

[05:01] * avar sleep &

[05:02] <audreyt> we can get as far as saying you need to explicitly lexicalize package globals

[05:02] <audreyt> ==> grep { our $PkgVar; ... } ==> ...

[05:02] <audreyt> otherwise you don't get to see $PkgVar

[05:02] <audreyt> (because otherwise we always need to clone the stash)

[05:03] <TimToady> sounds about right

[05:03] <audreyt> symtable that is

[05:03] <TimToady> don't mind another real use for "our" either.  :)

[05:03] <audreyt> heh, I use our all the time... even in p5

[05:03] <audreyt> in places where "use vars" won't work

[05:04] <TimToady> I use it where "use vars" would work.  :)

[05:04] <audreyt> s/in/even in/

[05:04] <TimToady> but the p5er's continually carp about it

[05:04] <TimToady> "what does it do that 'use vars' doesn't do?"...

[05:05] <audreyt> well p5 has this sublanguage in it (p4) that hates lexical scoping...

[05:06] <TimToady> there's still a bit of it in P6 too. O_o

[05:06] <TimToady> see "temp"...

[05:06] <TimToady> but I'm hoping 'is context' helps get away from that.

[05:07] *** lambdabot joined
[05:07] <TimToady> I suppose a thread sees the context vars in its spawning scope...

[05:08] <audreyt> I thought temp doesn't hate lexicals

[05:08] <audreyt> it's orthogonal

[05:08] <audreyt> unlike in p5

[05:08] <TimToady> well, but people will use it on globals

[05:08] <TimToady> and they'll think globals are all you can use it on.

[05:09] <TimToady> anyway temp is much more problematic when multiple threads are trying to do it

[05:11] <TimToady> so there's probably gotta be some restriction on temporizing things outside your current thread's storage, or some way of only letting one thread manage any global location.

[05:11] <TimToady> heh, one could almost turn temporization into the locking mechanism.

[05:11] <TimToady> assuming one needed a locking mechanism.

[05:12] <TimToady> hmm, can't temp a global outside a contend {}, maybe.

[05:12] <TimToady> but that'll really screw up the P4 programmers...

[05:14] <audreyt> well p4 has nothing like async{}

[05:14] <audreyt> and I'd be fine if temp in async setting is _always_ transactional

[05:15] <TimToady> and let, of course.

[05:15] <audreyt> yes.

[05:15] <TimToady> I think it makes sense

[05:15] <audreyt> TMVar, in GHC parlance

[05:15] <audreyt> (transactional mutex)

[05:15] <audreyt> since otherwise we can't reason about multiple dynamic scopes

[05:15] <TimToady> so it really is more like "suppose $x = 2"

[05:15] <audreyt> large bookkeepping overhead

[05:16] <audreyt> but they deserve it.

[05:19] <TimToady> luqui: how are you doin'?

[05:20] <luqui> bit sick

[05:20] <TimToady> lotta that stuff going around

[05:20] <luqui> also got a job...

[05:20] <TimToady> not as a garbage collector, I presume

[05:21] <luqui> no, but I applied for a job as one ('s author), didn't get it though

[05:21] <TimToady> if that's the one the reference was for, they never asked...

[05:22] <luqui> that was the one I wanted.  I suppose I should count my blessings; working on a C++ compiler might not be as much fun as I thought.  I mean, it's C++...

[05:22] <luqui> The reference just went on my resume.  Even if they never asked, I'm pretty sure it helped.

[05:22] <TimToady> dunno, they might have seen my name and puked

[05:22] <luqui> (hmm, no bachelors degree, but he's actually done something, unlike these other candidates)

[05:23] <luqui> heh, maybe.  I wouldn't be surprised if a C++ shop were full of zealots...

[05:23] <luqui> anyway

[05:25] <luqui> I like ruby sometimes, not others

[10:31] <moritz> hi Pat__ 

[10:34] <Pat__> so what interresting/fun stuff happening in perl6 these days ?

[10:34] <Pat__> I have been out of touch for a couple of years and just thought I'd catch up :-) Just for kicks.

[10:35] <moritz> well, we can compile to javscript ;)

[10:35] <moritz> javascript

[10:36] <moritz> and pugs passes >95% of the test suite (but that number *might* be misleading)

[10:36] <Pat__> heheh yea I guess the 95% easy part is done

[10:37] <Pat__> now the 5% hard part is left :-)

[10:37] <moritz> ?eval [+] (1 .. 10)

[10:37] *** evalbot_r15241 is now known as evalbot_r15248

[10:37] <evalbot_r15248> 55

[10:37] <moritz> some cool operators work ;)

[10:37] <Pat__> but about compiling to javascript where can i read more about it ... and playa little bit ?

[10:38] * Pat__ bows ot the eval bot :-)

[10:38] <moritz> you can play at http://run.pugscode.org/

[10:38] <lambdabot> Title: Run Perl 6 Now -- in your browser!

[10:38] <moritz> and read... well... there is svn repository ;)

[10:39] <moritz> Pat__: but honestly, Im the wrong person to ask... I only joined the project a week ago

[10:39] <moritz> Pat__: and I didnt write a single line of code, just test cases, docs etc.

[10:39] <Pat__> heheheh well I did not specify english so I guess the svn repo is a fair answer :p

[10:40] <Pat__> hey no problem, I'm just here to chat 

[10:40] <Pat__> no life saving decisions envolving perl6 (yet)

[10:40] *** TimToady joined
[10:40] <Pat__> so thatks for your help

[10:40] <moritz> ok, maybe somebody else can give you a more accurate summary

[10:40] <moritz> np :)

[10:41] * moritz is bored because my only HD died today, and all I can do is chat (booted from knoppix)

[10:42] <Pat__> heheh Everyone else seem so busy rushing perl6 out so door ;-) I don't want to bother anyoen :-)

[10:42] <moritz> you exagerate... nearly everybody fancies a half-technical chat now or then ;)

[10:43] <Pat__> well things is I had almost forgotten about perl6 ... thinking well it'll be ready when it'll be ready

[10:44] <Pat__> but then I just happened to read this http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html

[10:44] <lambdabot> Title: Stevey's Blog Rants: The Next Big Language

[10:44] <Pat__> and thought ... hey could it be perl 6

[10:45] <Pat__> and here I am enquiring about the state of the perl6 union.

[10:46] <moritz> well, it is active and progressing (I think thats important ;)

[10:47] <moritz> and of course it will be *so* cool once it is finished ;))

[10:48] <Pat__> It is already too cool and it is far from being finished :-)

[10:50] <moritz> but hey, it will be finished `til christmas ;)

[10:50] <moritz> (because when it`s finished, every day is x-mas ;)

[10:50] <Pat__> hahahaha

[10:51] <moritz> not my idea dude ;)

[10:52] <moritz> I have to go and get my laundry, brb

[10:52] <Pat__> ok thanks fo rthe pointer ... I'll be playing around with the javascript thingy. Bye

[15:26] <Juerd> My office is rewired the 24th

[15:26] <Juerd> That also means that if I'm going to the GPW, I have to leave during day 3

[15:27] <Juerd> And drive 10 hours.

[15:27] <rafl> ok

[15:28] <Juerd> "There are no parking facillities directly in the youth hostel grounds, however there are a number of free parking possibilities in the direct vacinity of the youth hostel."

[15:32] <Juerd> Why did you pick this hostel? :)

[15:33] *** prism joined
[15:35] <Juerd> Oh, it seems to be close to the venue

[15:38] <Juerd> Hm, â‚¬ 30 per night :(

[15:55] <Patterner> I plan to go to the GPW, but as long as I don't have a confirmation I won't book flights and hotel...

[15:56] <Juerd> rafl: There are hostels that charge half that amount, and provide free wifi and breakfast...

[15:57] <Juerd> Patterner: Where would you be flying from?

[15:57] <Patterner> Juerd: Hamburg

[15:57] <Juerd> Patterner: No car?

[15:57] <Patterner> Nope. Flying is cheaper and faster.

[15:58] <Juerd> I looked at flying options. For me it would be faster, but much more expensive.

[15:58] <Juerd> And it has the cost of inflexibility.

[15:58] <rafl> Juerd: oh no.. I didn't search for a hostel myself. My co-travelers did.. :-(

[15:58] <Juerd> Driving there and back again would cost me approx 80 â‚¬ for fuel.

[15:58] <Juerd> rafl: Have you already booked?

[15:59] <rafl> Juerd: yes

[15:59] <Juerd> rafl: Can you still cancel? :)

[15:59] <Patterner> 80-100 Euro for both flights... 1 hour flying time :)

[15:59] <rafl> Juerd: I think so..

[16:00] <Juerd> rafl: Talk to your cotravelers then :)

[16:00] <rafl> Juerd: will do :-)

[16:00] <Patterner> Bring a whip :)

[16:00] <Juerd> http://www.hostelworld.com/availability.php/WombatsCityHostel-Munich-8249

[16:01] <Juerd> Patterner: "free wifi in lobby" should suffice :)

[16:01] <Juerd> As should "half the price"

[16:01] <Juerd> And it's not that much further away from the venue

[16:03] <Juerd> And it's closer to the Hackerbruecke. Hacker bridges are always good.

[18:42] * nothingmuch actually saw some OGs at the train station

[18:42] <nothingmuch> note to self: get timberland boots and an ugly biege parka

[18:42] <dmq> and a gun?

[18:43] <nothingmuch> no, my assignment is simply to know how to be an OG

[18:43] <nothingmuch> not to go around OGing people

[18:43] <nothingmuch> (also, sardonic tone was lacking from that comment-- those gangsta's looked anything but original ;-)

[18:44] <dmq> heh

[18:44] <nothingmuch> my first thought on seeing the second one was "is that a different coat?" and then i realized it's a different human altogether

[18:45] <dmq> "human" :-)

[18:45] <nothingmuch> freud might have something to say about why I dind't think of using "person' ;-)

[18:45] <dmq> might?

[18:45] <nothingmuch> well, he's dead now

[18:46] <dmq> ah, that type of might. :-)

[18:51] <nothingmuch> hehe, i stole his ethernet ;-)

[19:45] <putter> is there any p5 construct which can take multiple statements and grab the value of the last (eg, do{...})  _without_ introducing a lexical scope?

[19:46] <putter> actually, what really matters is 'without introducing a scope for an local()s among the statements'.

[19:46] <putter> s/an/any

[19:54] <putter> sigh.  in p6, this will be a small macro.  in p5...

[19:55] * putter goes to explore cpan modules for something which pretends to parse p5

[19:55] <putter> suggestions most welcome

[21:23] <lambdabot> putter: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[21:25] <putter> unfortunately it looks hairy to do right, and PPI is testfailing on my platform... I'm not sure it's on the critical path so I'm punting for now.

[21:25] <putter> thanks again

[21:36] <putter> @tell cmarcelo A Commentary is indeed a better alternative to having a TALK associated with particular .hs files.  Agreed. :)

[21:36] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
