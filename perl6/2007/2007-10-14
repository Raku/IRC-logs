[10:14] <meppl> good morning

[10:15] *** xdemondogx joined
[10:16] <xdemondogx> can yuo make with perl6 games which yuo couldnt with perl5?

[10:16] <xdemondogx> small 2d games or so

[10:17] <moritz_> perl5 and perl6 are both turing complete, so you can write programs that do exaclty the same thing in both languages

[10:17] <moritz_> same as (nearly) all other programming languages

[10:17] <xdemondogx> so yuo can make small games

[10:18] <meppl> so, in perl5 theres no good data-sharing with threads

[10:19] <moritz_> xdemondogx: of course

[10:19] <xdemondogx> :o

[10:19] <xdemondogx> and 3d games :P

[10:19] <moritz_> meppl: ah yes. P6 threads will certainly be better, but they're not fully specced yet

[10:20] <moritz_> I think there was an example recently that showed how to use SDL with kp6

[10:20] <meppl> furthermore the object oriented programming is a little bit circumstantially to write in perl5

[10:21] <moritz_> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs//v6/v6-KindaPerl6/examples/sdl/simple.pl

[10:21] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/28q5og

[10:24] <xdemondogx> wtf?

[10:24] <xdemondogx> i jsut found out CrystalSpace supprots Perl5 O.o

[10:28] <moritz_> why not?

[10:32] <xdemondogx> it hough you couldnt make games with Perl lol

[10:34] <moritz_> for example "frozen bubbles" is written in Perl

[10:34] <xdemondogx> frozen bubbles?

[10:36] <xdemondogx> tetris lol

[16:06] <masak> wonder if it'll be a common pattern for infinite loops :)

[16:06] <masak> also, what happens if I feed that to an evalbot?

[16:06] <masak> it's not very memory-intensive. is there a timeout?

[17:20] <exp_evalbot> r18419: No output (you need to produce output to STDOUT)

[17:26] <masak> moritz_: good to hear

[17:29] *** DarkWolf84 joined
[17:36] <moritz_> masak: aditionally it runs in a chroot (at least exp_evalbot ;)

[17:39] <masak> moritz_: sounds sane

[17:42] <Aankhen``> Infinite loops are better written as `loop { ... }`, IIRC.

[17:42] <moritz_> kp6: loop { 1; }

[17:43] <masak> Aankhen``: yes, but this was a way to write an infinite loop as a statement modifier

[17:43] <masak> see discussion from a few days ago

[22:24] <mncharity> @tell fglock misc/kp6-repl.pl.  Cheers.

[22:24] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[22:34] *** jisom_ joined
[22:40] *** rindolf left
[22:46] <mncharity> avar: yes, go for it.  I basically just took audreyt's blog post and wrapped kp6 as a black box.  I didn't get a chance to look at the kp6 codebase, so, for instance, the file's package is currently named "RenameMe".  So assimilation is needed.
