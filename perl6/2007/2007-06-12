[00:04] <sfullenwider> how far away is perl6 to production?

[00:05] <moritz> one, two years perhaps

[00:05] <moritz> depends on your notioin of "production"

[00:06] <Tene> I've used it to produce things several months ago.

[00:07] <moritz> evalbot and svnbot are "producing" things as well ;)

[00:09] <Tene> ?eval "a small red dog"

[00:09] <evalbot_r16653> "a small red dog"

[00:09] <Tene> evalbot just produced a small red dog!

[01:08] <Tene> TimToady: I reinstalled F7 and pugs runs fine now, btw.

[01:20] <TimToady> yeah, saw that earlier, but too busy writing a talk to respond then...

[01:20] <TimToady> but I don't really want to trash my current install...

[01:21] <TimToady> I keep thinking there's some subset I can delete and reinstall

[01:21] * Tene nods.

[01:22] <Tene> However, after I installed, I added a bunch of packages with the 'Add/Remove Software' tool instead of just yum, and it failed to install dependencies for many of the packages installed, so beware.

[01:22] <TimToady> thanks

[01:23] <silug> Tene: did it just fail to download the packages?  usually you can just tell it to try again...

[01:23] <silug> <- fedora developer

[01:25] <TimToady> silug: I upgraded my laptop to F7, and now gnome always hangs coming up, so limping along on kde.  also, if I click on Languages on the greeter it immediately crashes.  any ideas?

[01:25] <Tene> silug: It claimed to have completed successfully, so I didn't bother to check.  Later, when trying to use applications, they would complain about missing deps.

[01:26] <Tene> after rpm -e and isntall via yum, everything worked fine.

[01:26] <silug> other people have told me about the gnome hangs.  the best guess i've heard is that they are dns-related.

[01:26] <silug> i'm a kde user, so i'm the wrong one to ask.  :)

[01:26] <silug> <- not terribly helpful fedora developer

[01:27] <silug> Tene: weird.  pirut is just a front-end to yum, so the behavior should have been identical.

[01:27] <TimToady> seems related to scim to me, maybe.

[01:27] <TimToady> can't bring up scim under kde either.

[01:28] <TimToady> which is why I haven't been typing much Japanese here lately...

[01:29] *** weinigLap joined
[01:29] <TimToady> so I'm guessing that F7's overall internationalization is less than robust under upgrade, at the moment.  quite possibly a complete reinstall would work, but I only have one major partition on my laptop.

[01:30] <silug> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=243234 may be the problem.

[01:31] <silug> imho f7 is one of the rougher fedora releases so far...  the core/extras merge was way more painful than ever anticipated.

[01:33] <TimToady> heh, the page with the fix is entirely in Japanese.  I guess I deserve that... :)

[01:34] <silug> and, for the record, since i'm extremely monolingual, i know almost nothing about scim

[01:34] <TimToady> but from the rest of the bug report, it definitely seems like the problem doesn't affect fresh installs, only upgrades

[01:35] <SamB> scim is also usable for maths input...

[01:35] <SamB> or would be if unicode characters were all it took

[01:36] <silug> "rm -rf /tmp/gconfd-* /tmp/scim-panel-socket-*" isn't the fix?

[01:39] <TimToady> oh, I didn't see the translation, just followed the link

[01:41] <silug> babelfish does a reasonable job translating that page.  i'm impressed.

[01:41] <TimToady> well, definitely looks like it got further, but will have to restart X

[08:52] <dduncan> well, I've basically just proven that a lot of web servers out there are refusing traffic just because the client's user agent says it is LWP ... but self-identifying as something else works fine

[08:52] *** unobe is now known as unobe_away

[08:53] <dduncan> this adds a bother if I want to test now and then that links in a web site list are still valid, automatically

[08:53] *** unobe_away is now known as unobe

[08:53] <dduncan> at least, it means I can't use LWP::Simple

[08:57] <Tene> dduncan: wow.

[08:58] <gaal> dduncan: a quick peek suggets you can override _init_ua and get around that.

[08:58] <dduncan> mind you, I got other benefits from switching to the slightly more complicated LWP::UserAgent

[08:59] <dduncan> yes, I already worked out the solution

[08:59] <dduncan> just set $ua->agent() to something else

[08:59] <dduncan> and it worked

[08:59] <Tene> Set it to "Ell Double-You Pee"

[08:59] <dduncan> oh, your suggestion was how to get LWP::Simple itself to work?

[08:59] <gaal> It would have been great if LWP::Simple had called "$ua->agent( $class->get_default_agent )" or something similar

[08:59] <dduncan> well, no matter, I like the additional benefits of switching

[09:00] <gaal> but the shotgun method is *{"LWP::Simple::_init_ua"} = sub {...}

[09:00] <dduncan> one moment ...

[09:02] <Aankhen``> $ua->agent('gaal');

[09:02] <Aankhen``> Mwahaahahahahaahaaha.

[09:03] <dduncan> the init-ua thing wouldn't have helped in my situation

[09:03] <dduncan> but just using UA instead did

[09:04] <gaal> $ua->agent('sekkrit')

[09:04] <Tene> $ua->agent('m√∏√∏se');

[09:04] <dduncan> see, the way I was using it before, LWP::Simple::get wouldn't have been using an actual $ua behind the scenes, so the init_ua thing would never be invoked

[09:04] <gaal> actually you should do agentname/version

[09:04] <gaal> 'mse/1.√∏√∏'

[09:04] * Tene laughs.

[09:05] <dduncan> it was using _trivial_http_get , which hardcodes everything

[09:05] <gaal> ouch

[09:05] <gaal> ::Simple modules are

[09:05] <dduncan> the downside of using the full UserAgent is extra CPAN prereqs ... HTML-Parser and HTMl-Tagset

[09:05] <gaal> { package DWIM::Simple; sub AUTOLOAD { die "not supported" } }

[09:05] <dduncan> which I didn't have to install before

[09:06] <dduncan> the LWP package included both Simple and UserAgent, so both were already installed anyway

[09:06] * Tene was going to make a joke about that statement being produced by gaal::Simple while waiting for the continuation.

[09:06] <dduncan> that is, installing simple installed the other

[09:08] <gaal> good thing cpan.org accepts LWP::Simple UAs...

[09:09] <dduncan> well, the majority of urls in my database that I tried did accept LWP::Simple ... just a few hundred out of about 20-thousand didn't

[09:09] <dduncan> so maybe 1-2% or so are the problem

[09:10] <dduncan> still, that's a large number

[09:10] <Tene> dduncan: what % by host instead of url?  What market segment do these hosts represent?  Etc.

[09:11] <dduncan> the web addrs are businesses and/or other organizations that provide amenities to tourists

[09:12] <dduncan> its a tourism related website

[09:12] <dduncan> that I'm working on for my $job

[09:12] <dduncan> the database was seeded a few years ago by other people

[09:12] <Tene> 'kay

[09:13] <dduncan> so for the most part, every url is a different host

[09:13] <dduncan> maybe that's what you wanted to know

[09:13] <Tene> It is.

[09:17] <dduncan> on a tangent, today is probably the first time I ever used alarm() in a program ... in this case, to timeout a page fetch ... done before the move to UA ... some pages simply hung Simple ... not sure if this is still necessary, as I also give UA a timeout value

[09:17] <dduncan> currently, I give it 30s, and have my own alarm for 40s

[09:23] <dduncan> on an unrelated matter, I note an interesting coincidence that both the GPLv3 (date announced 2 weeks ago) and the iPhone (date announced today) are both planned to be released on the same day, June 29th

[09:28] * gaal is disappointed to find you can't tie package symtable hashes in Perl 5

[09:28] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[09:29] <Aankhen``> sub FETCH { if (rand(10) % 2) { return "Sorry, no symbols for you today."; } }

[09:29] <Aankhen``> Er, int(rand(10))

[09:29] <gaal> doesn't work :(

[09:29] <gaal> doesn't work either :)

[09:30] <Aankhen``> Pah.

[09:30] <Aankhen``> A mere trifle.

[09:31] <dduncan> so it seems the end result was about 600 web addrs out of 23000 or so were rejecting traffic based on 'lwp' identifier

[17:01] <fglock>  token xyz { <foo> | <bar> }; eval " token foo { abc }; /<xyz>/ "

[17:01] <fglock> right?

[17:01] <[particle]> i think so

[17:01] <fglock> I meant to compile that to:

[17:02] <fglock>  token xyz { <foo> | <bar> }; eval " my token xyz { <foo> | <bar> }; token foo { abc }; /<xyz>/ "

[17:02] <fglock> using an AST transformation, so that it can be figured out statically

[17:03] <fglock> where the 'my' happens at the appropriate OUTER level

[19:50] <obra> Patrick is the main consumer of Parrot for Perl 6.

[19:51] <obra> I believe he's about to mail the lists about DFA and regexps

[19:52] <Coke> k. I'll bug him.

[19:55] <dduncan> I may be missing context, but if that exchange wasn't a joke, it didn't make much sense

[19:56] <Coke> it only had to make sense to me and obra.

[19:56] <dduncan> nothing else in prior backlog

[19:57] <dduncan> something about a person being the main customer

[19:57] <dduncan> but then I may have misread it

[19:57] <obra> dduncan: made perfect sense to me and coke

[19:57] <dduncan> well never mind

[19:58] <Coke> well, parrot's "customers" are the language developers. one of the languages is going to be perl6 - need to make sure parrot supports perl6 - do I talk to the perl6 PM for those requirements? (most of which are there and/or obvious) Turns out, no, I talk to the one guy who's in charge of perl6 specifically on parrot, patrick.

[19:59] <Coke> this is all part of my trying to prepare for parrot 1.0...an dmore importantly, my talk about same in 2 weeks.

[19:59] <dduncan> yup

[20:00] <[particle]> do you think it'll work?

[20:00] <Coke> do I think what will work?

[20:00] <Coke> No, i think we're all doomed. =-)

[20:00] <[particle]> *phew*

[20:01] <moritz> Coke: did you speak to fglock? iirc his miniperl6 project has a PIR emitter, maybe he has some good suggestions

[20:02] <Coke> He's on #parrot. haven't had a full discussion with him yet, though, I think he's coordinating with patrick.

[20:03] <Coke> p6 on parrot, btw, is reaaaaly close to running Test.pm; hopefully that'll open some floodgates for more development.

[20:03] <Coke> Should I complain that there are things in Test.pm that aren't tested in sanity?

[20:03] <[particle]> in pugs current sanity tests?

[20:03] <[particle]> yes.

[20:03] <[particle]> in parrot's old sanity tests? maybe not.

[20:04] <Coke> ok. we are parsing all the 01- tests. however, 'use Test' fail with a syntax error. So, some syntax isn't being testing in 01-sanity.

[20:04] <Coke> [particle]: : I've already resolved that issue to at least last week's version of pugs tests.

[20:04] <[particle]> oh? fab!

[20:05] <Coke> in fact, 'make spectest' in .../perl6 will svn export the pugs tests right there and run them, in case I missed something.

[23:22] <TimToady> hmm, I think svnbot6 and specbot6 need to be reinvited... :/

[23:24] <Limbic_Region> how does that work

[23:27] *** TimToady joined
[23:30] <TimToady> how does which work?  inviting?  I don't know, except it apparently takes a channel operator, and doesn't seem to be sticky.  that's all I've intuited so far...

[23:31] <Tene> /invite svnbot6

[23:32] *** obvio171_ is now known as obvio171

[23:32] <Tene> sends a message to the client saying "you've been invited to suchandsuch channel" and also on many servers overrides a ban, or the channel could be set to invite-only.

[23:39] <Limbic_Region> oh, chan op required - makes sense
