[00:24] <TimToady> geoffb: default is graphemes, but pugs currently does codepoints.

[00:24] <TimToady> the pragmas are probably "use codes" and "use graphs"

[00:25] <TimToady> to go with "use bytes"

[00:27] <geoffb> TimToady: right, thanks

[00:29] <moritz> pugs doesn't implement the "use {codes,graphs}" though

[00:29] <moritz> at least not now ;-)

[00:30] <TimToady> it could be taught to treat 'use codes' as a no-op for futureproofing, I suppose

[00:30] <moritz> when I define my own classes, how do I override how the stringify (or behave in arbitrary contexts)?

[13:45] <moritz> spinclad: do you have significant changes in your local svn copy?

[13:45] <spinclad> hi moritz

[13:45] <moritz> spinclad: if not, just rm -rf it, and do a new checkout

[13:46] <moritz> spinclad: or you could try --no-auth-cache (just a guess)

[13:47] <spinclad> possibly a few in my third-party/judy stuff from last year; i'll just save that and check out fresh as you say.

[14:58] <lichtkind> ahh

[14:58] <Leibsle> lichtkind, sorry for my delayed reaction. been a bit busy lately

[14:58] <lichtkind> nop

[14:58] <Leibsle> lichtkind, how is your perl fetish doing? :P

[14:58] <lichtkind> du bist wo du bist :)

[14:59] <lichtkind> what do you mean?

[14:59] <Leibsle> well. you even write wiki articles about perl. so you must have a fetish :P

[15:01] <Leibsle> maybe similar to buu and his bot fetish :)

[15:01] * Leibsle covers

[15:02] <lichtkind> its a kind of fetish true but i make it for fun fetish is always an action done instead of a true longing

[15:03] <Leibsle> you are right. i might better speak of "fascination" instead of a "fetish"

[15:14] <lichtkind> Leibsle: but you are partially right if i know there is something to do and i want to be busy i do write in wikipedia :)

[15:14] <lichtkind> but i love the way of thinking behind perl yes

[15:14] * Leibsle wants to hire lichtkind f¸r einen 1 euro job :P

[15:14] <lichtkind> why?

[15:15] <Leibsle> cause i need lots of help with my poor perl skills

[15:15] <Leibsle> i would like to port a project 

[15:16] <moritz> what kind of project?

[15:16] <Leibsle> a community portal

[15:17] <lichtkind> we have already perl monks

[15:17] <lichtkind> and perl-community.de

[15:17] <Leibsle> its licenced under BSD with the advertising clause. so i would have to spam for the community that made it. but the community stinks. its full of abusive, immature criminals

[15:18] <Leibsle> not a perl community, a community for general topics also

[15:18] <lichtkind> its human :)

[15:18] <lichtkind> aah

[15:18] <moritz> lumi: porting communitity portal = porting the software that drives the portal? *g*

[15:18] <moritz> sorry, Leibsle, not lumi

[15:19] <Leibsle> i wonder what could happen to me if i use a software licenced under the old BSD license and break the advertising clause

[15:19] <moritz> there are far too many nicks here that start with l ;-)

[18:14] <lichtkind> thtas all models

[18:14] <lichtkind> buts in facts its all geometra

[18:15] <moritz> is it all energy, or all geometry?

[18:16] <lichtkind> maybe we meet at perl workshop or so

[18:17] <moritz> personally I think that the universe can't be explained only by simple rules because it _is_ not simple

[18:17] <lichtkind> but in the end its all about geometry and dimensions

[18:17] <lichtkind> mathematicans call it algebraism

[18:18] <lichtkind> modern M-Theory speaks about up to 27 dimensions

[18:18] <lichtkind> thats is really heavvy

[18:18] <lichtkind> sometimes i think i can understand 5 dimentions

[18:18] <[particle]> she's not heavy, she's my universe.

[18:18] <moritz> lichtkind: just think of it as "n dimensions", and then project it down to 3+1

[23:23] <lichtkind> buubot: eval: [+] 3,4,5

[23:23] <buubot> Number found where operator expected at eval line 1, near "] 3"  (Missing operator before  3?) Error: syntax error at eval line 1, near "+]"  

[23:23] <lichtkind> its perl5

[23:24] <moritz> buubot: eval while(fork()) { fork() }

[23:24] <moritz> no answer...

[23:25] <lichtkind> manno

[23:25] <moritz> buubot: eval system "cat /etc/passwd"

[23:25] <moritz> lichtkind: you won't say that it's an unsecured eval()?

[23:26] <lichtkind> moritz: no i wanted say that OwlEye  wont be pleased when somebody chrashes his server again

[23:26] <OwlEye> buubot is not on my server :) master buu owns it

[23:27] <snoop0x7b> lichtkind: is that eval really... uh... that ... bad?

[23:27] <snoop0x7b> that it will do anything anyone wants

[23:27] <moritz> buubot: eval 1

[23:27] <buubot> ?eval 1 = 7;

[23:27] *** evalbot_r15829 is now known as evalbot_r15831

[23:27] <evalbot_r15831> Error: Can't modify constant item: VInt 1

[23:27] <lichtkind> snoop0x7b: ask OwlEye , its his bot

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> 19:24 < moritz> buubot: eval while(fork()) { fork() }

[23:28] <OwlEye> lichtkind, no no. its not mine. i made a copy of it once. but buubot is buu's bot

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> well since it's still alive

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> it didn't do that

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> :p

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> probably anyhow

[23:28] <moritz> snoop0x7b: I noticed that

[23:28] <snoop0x7b> :P

[23:28] <lichtkind> yes

[23:29] <moritz> buubot: eval system("pwd")

[23:29] <snoop0x7b> buubot: eval system("ls")

[23:29] <moritz> it seems to have at least a bit security built in

[23:30] <moritz> buubot: eval print join ",", @INC;

[23:30] <snoop0x7b> buubot: eval print "I'm ugly"

[23:30] <moritz> seems like buubot ignores me... for good reaseon

[23:31] <snoop0x7b> ?eval print "moo"

[23:31] <evalbot_r15831> OUTPUT[moo] Bool::True

[23:31] <snoop0x7b> apparently that eval bot likes me

[23:31] <snoop0x7b> :p

[23:32] *** prism joined
[23:32] <moritz> snoop0x7b: that should be "moose", though ;-)

[23:33] *** ofer0 joined
[23:34] *** ofer0 is now known as ofer

[23:49] <unobe> hi moritz

[23:51] <moritz> unobe: I haven't updated yet, but I manged to build 15831 - although I don't know what went wrong in the first place

[23:52] <moritz> unobe: tomorrow I'll build HEAD and tell you again, now I'm off for sleep++ ;-)

[23:52] <moritz> sorry for the fuzz
