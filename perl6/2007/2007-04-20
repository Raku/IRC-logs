[07:13] <svnbot6> r16026 | agentz++ | * run-smoke.pl now honours the HARNESS_PUGS environment which defaults to './pugs'

[07:13] <svnbot6> r16026 | agentz++ | * added util/limited_pugs for restricting './pugs' via the ulimit command in sh.

[07:13] <svnbot6> r16027 | agentz++ | limited_pugs now limited to a cputime of 120 sec

[07:13] <svnbot6> r16028 | agentz++ | * made prove6 *nix friendly.

[07:14] <agentzh> my svk seems to have problems.

[07:14] <svnbot6> r16029 | agentz++ | * run-smoke.pl - some win32 love.

[07:14] <svnbot6> r16029 | agentz++ | * limited_pugs - added the 'nice -n5' and 'ulimit -v 800000' contraints.

[07:15] <agentzh> these commits are very old.

[07:18] <agentzh> i see a lot of conflicts.

[07:19] <agentzh> and it seems i'm repeating existing commits made by others and myself over the last few days :(

[07:22] *** rissy joined
[07:23] <agentzh> maybe svk v2.0.1 is just unstable.

[07:23] <clkao> huh? what are you trying to do ?

[07:24] <agentzh> clkao: i'm trying 'svk push'

[07:24] <agentzh> (as normal)

[07:24] <agentzh> but a lot of conflicts between //mirror/pugs and //local/pugs occurred.

[07:25] <agentzh> it seems svk is repeating old commits in the last few days.

[07:25] *** jisom joined
[07:25] <agentzh> very weird.

[07:26] <clkao> is your uuid same as somebody else's?

[07:26] <agentzh> no idea.

[07:26] <agentzh> how to check that?

[07:28] <clkao> cat db/uuid

[07:28] <clkao> is this depot a fresh mirror or you copied from somewhere else?

[07:28] <agentzh> it's a fresh mirror.

[07:28] <agentzh> i'm on my own machine, not feather.

[07:29] <agentzh> 6e2bbe1e-9bb6-457c-9519-9cf87a6f6883

[07:30] * agentzh needs to revert the previous bogus commits to pugs.

[07:31] *** franck__ joined
[07:31] <agentzh> sorry, but how can i revert svn commits using svk? (i know how on win32 with TortoiseSVN, but not linux)

[07:33] *** SubStack joined
[07:33] <clkao> svk merge -c -N //path //path

[07:34] <agentzh> clkao: ah, thanks.

[07:45] <agentzh> clkao: cool, thanks

[07:46] <agentzh> $ svk merge -C -c -16029@  //local/pugs2 //mirror/pugs

[07:46] <agentzh> Change spec -16029@ not recognized.

[07:47] <agentzh> oh, i should exchange the paths.

[07:48] <agentzh> clkao: it works now. thank you :)

[07:48] <agentzh> i've started another local branch for the pugs mirror.

[09:32] <lambdabot> Title: Making it stick.: Misguided: The Road Not To Be Travelled, http://tinyurl.com/2n7gbd

[09:36] *** TimToady joined
[09:41] <svnbot6> r16034 | Darren_Duncan++ | added test t/operators/brainos.t which checks that a =~ invocation dies at compile time

[09:42] *** TimToady joined
[09:42] <dduncan> I haven't read it yet, but the principle of STM is good, so an argument against that principle would be misguided ... will read now ...

[09:44] <Aankhen``> Thanks.  I don't really understand the concepts and pitfalls involved well enough to figure out whether the arguments presented are valid, so I thought this would be a good place to find people who would. =)

[09:44] <Aankhen``> s/who would/who could/

[09:48] <dduncan> STM is just a mechanism where a coder says that a collection of actions must be atomic, and being able to do that is a good thing

[09:48] <Aankhen``> Right.

[09:48] <dduncan> I don't see how that can be bad

[09:48] *** TimToady joined
[09:49] <dduncan> the gist I got from the paper is that the writer says that STM can be misuded, and therefore its better not to include the feature,

[09:49] <moritz> but perl never worked that way

[09:49] <dduncan> which sounds like the antithesis of Perl

[09:49] <moritz> perl always offers any possibility ;)

[09:50] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[09:50] <dduncan> Perl gives you lots of tools and you choose what to use

[09:50] <moritz> even goto *g*

[09:50] <Aankhen``> Indeed.

[09:50] <Aankhen``> moritz: Hey don't be hatin' on the goto.

[09:50] <Aankhen``> goto &foo; # tr√®s useful :-)

[09:50] <dduncan> hey, goto is very powerful ... that's how we get coroutines and exceptions to work, the former particularly

[09:50] <moritz> Aankhen``: I'm merely remarking upon the fact that most "modern" langauges don't have goto anymore

[09:50] <Aankhen``> moritz: Ah, right.

[09:51] <dduncan> well, I mean the principle of goto is useful

[09:51] <dduncan> that sometimes you don't have to complete your current block before executing another

[09:51] <Aankhen``> moritz: Sorry, it's 2:50 AM and I've spent the better part of the last few hours in a groggy state reading mostly abstract papers or articles on programming. :-P

[09:51] <dduncan> its that way here too

[09:51] <dduncan> 2:52am here

[09:51] <moritz> Aankhen``: no problem ;)

[09:51] <Aankhen``> ^_^

[09:52] <moritz> 11:50 am here ;)

[09:52] <moritz> no, 10:50, sorry ;I

[09:52] <moritz> my irc client lies on a server in a different time zone

[09:52] <moritz> which is sometimes confusing ;)

[09:52] <Aankhen``> dduncan: Hmm, let me see. What I take away from the post, after repeated reading, is that we should be moving towards having no shared state.

[09:52] <Aankhen``> Whereas he implies STM is about having everything shared.

[09:53] <dduncan> I got that from it too

[09:53] *** ruoso joined
[09:53] <dduncan> I see STM as dealing about things possibly being shared, and so be safe just in case ... its like being thread safe

[09:53] <Aankhen``> Ah, good, I'm not quite insane then.  At least on that count.

[09:53] * Aankhen`` nods.

[09:53] *** TimToady joined
[09:54] <Aankhen``> Atomic operations cannot include I/O activity, right?

[09:54] <dduncan> broadly speaking, yes they can

[09:54] <Aankhen``> (In Perl 6, at any rate.)

[09:54] <dduncan> the caveat is that I/O operations can't be undone

[09:54] <Aankhen``> Yeah.

[09:54] <dduncan> I mean, some can't be undone

[09:55] <dduncan> if the I/O is with the filesystem, it should be undoable

[09:55] <dduncan> that's what DBMSs do already

[09:55] <dduncan> but if its with users or a network, probably not

[09:56] <Aankhen``> atomic { ...; $dbh->do('DELETE FROM `users`'); fail "Oops, didn't mean to do that"; }

[09:56] <Aankhen``> Might be a tad hard to get out of that one.

[09:56] <dduncan> that's why proper DBMSs have rollback

[09:56] <Aankhen``> Ergh, shame on me for mixing P5 and P6 there.

[09:56] <Aankhen``> Aye.

[09:57] <Aankhen``> But I guess from the language's point of view, it has no idea of knowing, so it has to err on the side of caution.

[09:57] <dduncan> fyi, in my DBMS, you usually specify an atomic operation with, eg, "atomic { ... }" rather than begin/commit/rollback

[09:57] <Aankhen``> So throwing an exception within that means the block fails, falling off normally means it's committed?

[09:57] <dduncan> though that's an option ... all statements in my DBMS are implicitly atomic anyway

[09:58] <dduncan> yes

[09:58] <Aankhen``> Makes sense.

[09:58] <dduncan> statements and routines both

[09:58] *** TimToady joined
[09:58] <dduncan> the only time one would actually say atomic { ... } is if they want just a block within a routine to be separately atomic, and then that block may be called try { ...} rather

[09:59] <Aankhen``> Indeed.

[09:59] <dduncan> since the STM is essentially tied to standard control flow or exceptions

[09:59] <dduncan> but that's in my system, obviously Perl would have a separate atomic {}, since everything is not implicitly transactional

[10:00] <Aankhen``> Ergh, do you know which synopsis `contend` is in?

[10:00] <Aankhen``> Doesn't seem to be in S04 or S06.

[10:00] <dduncan> fyi, what I've written on the matter so far is in ext/QDRDBMS/lib/QDRDBMS/Language.pod

[10:00] <Aankhen``> Oh, excellent.  I'll take a look.

[10:00] <Aankhen``> Hmm, I should probably svn up Pugs too.

[10:00] <Aankhen``> I've been pretty lax about that.

[10:01] <dduncan> to be clear, my last comment was about transaction support in my DBMS, not 'contend'

[10:01] <Aankhen``> Heh, figured as much.

[10:01] <Aankhen``> Er, did I just imagine `contend`?  I can't find it in any synopsis.

[10:02] <dduncan> as for 'contend', I would have expected it to be in S04

[10:02] <dduncan> or either of those actually

[10:02] <dduncan> looking ...

[10:02] <dduncan> is 'async' anywhere?

[10:02] <dduncan> I mean, 'atomic'

[10:02] <dduncan> though both of those ought to appear together

[10:02] <Aankhen``> I see a mention of both contend and async in S04.

[10:02] <Aankhen``> Under `Other do-like forms`.

[10:03] *** TimToady joined
[10:08] *** TimToady joined
[10:13] *** TimToady joined
[10:15] <dduncan> Aankhen, actually, like DBMS transactions, I see one of the main benefits of STM not necessarily having anything to do with shared state ... its that it provides an easy mechanism to undo some partitially completed actions ... and this can be true in isolation

[10:15] <dduncan> so then, STM is orthogonal to shared states, which the paper talked about

[10:16] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[10:16] <dduncan> in my understanding, STM is just like a database transaction, but it just deals with a program's memory state

[10:16] <Aankhen``> That's what I thought too.

[10:17] <Aankhen``> I think I must reluctantly go to bed now.

[10:17] <dduncan> right then

[10:17] <Aankhen``> dduncan: Always nice to talk to you. :-)

[10:17] <Aankhen``> G'night.

[11:14] <diakopter> (Damian has included many inline examples of Perldoc/Pod that would be excellent initial tests)

[11:14] <agentzh> smartlinks.pl can't parse Perl 6 POD yet.

[11:14] <agentzh> are those tests in Perl 6?

[11:14] <diakopter> oh.  I thought it parsed the html.

[11:15] <agentzh> diakopter: it parses the POD directly.

[11:15] <agentzh> parsing HTML will be harder.

[16:55] <TimToady> does IRC use TCP?

[16:57] <rindolf> TimToady: yes, it does.

[16:57] <TimToady> resetting it seems to have helped, anyway.  we'll see...

[16:58] <TimToady> (other evidence: yum couldn't actually download an entire rpm from any one repo)

[16:59] <TimToady> moritz: is it possible to set up the logger table such that it doesn't exceed the width of the page and wraps the text instead?  It's kindof irritating to have to scroll right to see the ends of many comments.

[16:59] <moritz> TimToady: I'll do my best ;)

[17:00] <moritz> is there a simple html/css solution for auto-wrapping text in tables?

[17:01] <TimToady> dunno, not an expert in css.  I think bare html has percentage widths on table columns, but whether that can be percent of page width I don't know.

[17:01] <moritz> ah, it normally does wrap, but in this case pastebot spammed the table with one long word...

[17:01] <moritz> and a single word is normally not wrapped automatically

[17:02] <TimToady> well, banning pastbot isn't the answer.  :)

[17:03] <theorbtwo> overflow: scroll ?

[17:04] <moritz> as a workaround a deleted that one line

[17:43] <cmarcelo> moritz: thank you. :) a question: are we "dropping" colabti.de because of your solution or your solution came because colabti.de "dropped"?

[17:46] <moritz> cmarcelo: second one

[17:46] <moritz> cmarcelo: we had no logger, so I wrote one ;)

[17:46] *** edenc joined
[17:56] *** ilbot-test joined
[17:57] <TimToady> colabti also defaults to latin-1 rather than utf-8

[17:58] <TimToady> and of course we pay no attention to the fact that it's written in Python.  </wink>

[18:01] <Juerd> I think an IRC logger should default to UTF-8, and then interpret invalid UTF-8 byte sequences as Windows-1252.

[18:02] <Juerd> Irssi does this, and it really works out well in the real world.

[18:03] <moritz> Juerd: mine currently uses Encode::Guess with utf-8 and latin1, and falls back to utf-8

[18:03] <Juerd> How can you ever fall back to utf-8?

[18:03] <moritz> Juerd: so far it semms to work

[18:04] <moritz> well, guess() returns either a decoding or undef

[18:04] <moritz> and in case of undef I use utf-8

[18:04] <Juerd> Oh, you're using heuristics? :(

[18:04] <moritz> Juerd: why not? it's rather easy to distinguish latin1 and utf-8

[18:05] <geoffb> Don't knock heuristics.  Heuristics made me the man I am today.

[18:05] <geoffb> ;-)

[18:05] <Juerd> moritz: On a line by line basis, yes.

[18:06] <Juerd> But you'll be considering entire lines to be latin1 if they contain a single utf8 error.

[18:06] <Juerd> I guess that's not a big problem.

[18:07] <moritz> Juerd: I decided not to think more about it until I see it failing

[18:07] <OwlEye> TimToady, was somebody messing with your connection earlier?

[18:07] <Juerd> I don't think it'll fail.

[18:07] <TimToady> nah, flakey Linksys firewall, apparently

[18:42] *** veritos joined
[18:43] <fglock_> ah, it's a macro

[18:43] <TimToady> fglock_: no, means the prototype isn't stringifying right

[18:43] <TimToady> WHAT should merely return the prototype

[18:44] <fglock_> but aren't all objects prototypes (potentially)

[18:44] <offby1> The trouble with a kitten is THAT / Eventually it becomes a CAT            -- Ogden Nash

[18:44] <TimToady> there's a profound difference under tagmemics between "is a

[18:44] <TimToady> between "is a" and "may be used as a"

[18:45] <TimToady> any object may be used as a prototype

[18:45] <TimToady> that doesn't mean that all objects are prototypes

[18:45] <TimToady> just as all objects maybe used as a boolean

[18:45] <fglock_> ok

[18:45] <wolverian> no wikipedia page for our moose? aww.

[18:50] <rindolf> TimToady: :-)

[18:50] <rindolf> "I'm not an actor! I just play one on T.V."

[18:51] <moritz> TimToady: where should I link specbot revisions to?

[18:51] <veritos> although APL can be more clean:

[18:51] <TimToady> APLs monadic vs dyadic distinction is not really that far off from what Perl 6 does with prefix: vs infix:

[18:51] <veritos> perl: print <STDIN> + <STDIN>

[18:51] <veritos> apl: (box) + (box)

[18:51] <TimToady> however, I think APL is badly Huffman coded

[18:51] <wolverian> APL has monads?! :)

[18:52] <integral> The other monadic :-)

[18:52] <fglock_> the prototype is just a special 'instance'?

[18:52] <TimToady> some operators need to be longer than one character

[18:53] <TimToady> it's an undefined instance

[18:54] <TimToady> so it can be used in reasoning about the class as if it were an instance, as long as you don't actually try to ask it to behave as an object.

[18:54] <lambdabot> Title: Image:LifeInApl.gif - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[18:56] <TimToady> Unfortunately it's a different meaning of "prototype" from how "prototype OO languages" define it.

[18:57] <TimToady> but we never thought of a better term

[18:58] <TimToady> but our prototype is actually rather more like a prototype than a parent

[18:58] <TimToady> our Rocket class is made out of cardboard, and just looks like a Rocket

[18:59] * jjore-w thinks cardboard rockets sounds like a game.

[18:59] <fglock_> ok, I think I found out a possible implementation

[18:59] <TimToady> many small rockets actually are cardboard.

[18:59] * jjore-w rolls to see if his rocket launches.

[19:00] <TimToady> you have to worry about pitches and yaws too

[19:01] <TimToady> hmm, more likely the Rocket is made out of Styrofoam¬Æ

[19:02] <veritos> TimToady: we get it. you worked at JPL. great. /sarcasm

[19:04] <TimToady> well, happens to be I did work there, but my interest in rockets goes back way before that...

[21:12] <fglock> and the class 'is' the class

[21:13] <[particle]> ...so new should create a class given a metaclass.

[21:13] <[particle]> at least, that's how i interpret it, but i may be way off

[21:17] <fglock> I see I'm still stuck with a bad concept of 'prototype' (and now 'metaclass')

[22:59] <offby1> yikes

[22:59] <offby1> guess that wasn't UTF-8

[22:59] <veritos> offby1: eh?

[22:59] <offby1> what zgh said 34 minutes ago

[22:59] <veritos> oh.

[23:00] <moritz> no, it wasn't

[23:00] <moritz> and it wasn't clean latin-1 or iso-8859-15 either

[23:00] <offby1> IRC channels ought to announce their preferred coding system in their topics.

[23:00] <TimToady> the logger decided it meant √¢‚Äû¬¢/bye

[23:01] <offby1> and the language, too, if that's not obvious from the rest of the topic ...

[23:01] <moritz> which is nonsense

[23:01] <TimToady> it also decided I should be boldface red somehow...

[23:01] <offby1> does the logger try to interpret the bytes as characters?

[23:02] <moritz> offby1: it tries to guess if a line is latin1 or utf8, and decodes accordingly

[23:02] <offby1> gosh, it's ecumenical

[23:03] <moritz> TimToady: is there a color you'd prefer?

[23:03] <moritz> scott asked me to color-code nicks...

[23:03] <veritos> i would assume that he prefers a toady green.

[23:03] <moritz> and so I did ;)

[23:04] <TimToady> and maybe audreyt would prefer red, given she's chinese...

[23:05] <veritos> TimToady: that's TAIWANESE to you.

[23:05] <TimToady> 'sides, after a while the two capital T's start looking like red thumtacks.

[23:05] <TimToady> Tang is a perfectly good Chinese name.

[23:05] <TimToady> has a lot of history

[23:06] <TimToady> but yes, I do rather like green.

[23:07] <TimToady> how are you assigning the other colors?

[23:10] <moritz> currently hand-coded

[23:15] <TimToady> actually, I also like purple

[23:15] <TimToady> maybe you should make audreyt infrared and me ultraviolet.  :)

[23:15] <veritos> TimToady: what's the shade of blue (in rgb hex) for the camel v3 cover?

[23:16] <TimToady> hmm, no clue

[23:16] <TimToady> but I'll bet it's changing with Perl 6 in any case

[23:17] <veritos> about a nice light orange?

[23:19] <TimToady> gaal should probably be moose colored

[23:21] <TimToady> another idea is to not repeat the name for subsequent messages from the same person.

[23:21] <moritz> It ried color: moose; in the CSS file, but firefox didn't recognize it ;)

[23:21] <TimToady> maybe you should have tried "chocolate moose"... :)

[23:22] <moritz> my ppor keyboard ;)

[23:27] <TimToady> unfortunately, O'Reilly already has a Moose Book, the Apache Cookbook.

[23:27] <Limbic_Region> salutatoins all

[23:27] <Limbic_Region> er um

[23:27] <Tene> Is there a Goose Book?

[23:27] <Limbic_Region> well, you get the point

[23:28] <demq> Caribou

[23:29] <TimToady> maybe we just need a Camel strapped to a Rocket...

[23:30] <Tene> We could have the Moose (plural) Book.

[23:30] <moritz> or a moose folded around an onion

[23:30] <veritos> Tene: meese???

[23:32] <TimToady> I don't think anyone has used the polar bear in the snowstorm yet...

[23:32] *** ortmage_ joined
[23:32] <moritz> Ayn Rand used that for "Atlas Shrugged"

[23:33] <moritz> but everbody thought it was just a plain white cover ;)

[23:34] <TimToady> I don't suppose we could get rights to Rocky and Bullwinkle...

[23:36] <veritos> hmm, i wonder if we could get some Microsoft clip art . . . (naughty look)

[23:38] *** [particle] joined
[23:41] <Limbic_Region> are we talking about possible O'Reilly animals for a book?

[23:42] <veritos> Limbic_Region: i think

[23:42] <Limbic_Region> I think the perfect one to use would be the spoof I am sure you have all seen

[23:42] <Limbic_Region> http://perl6.ru/img/perl6book-parody.gif

[23:43] <offby1> :-)

[23:43] <offby1> I must say I like that.

[23:43] <TimToady> it hath its charms

[23:43] <veritos> wasn't that in one of audrey's presentations?

[23:43] <moritz> nice ;)

[23:43] <moritz> bed &

[23:44] <offby1> bed & breakfast

[23:44] <Limbic_Region> veritos - possible but I don't know for sure

[23:44] <veritos> Limbic_Region: it's on youtube...just search for audrey yapc.

[23:44] <TimToady> yes, she used it in composition with some other things

[23:45] * Limbic_Region is too busy eating

[23:45] <TimToady> I hope you are eating neither your bed nor your breakfast.

[23:46] <buu> What's wrong with eating breakfast?

[23:46] <offby1> ... and too eating busy

[23:47] <Limbic_Region> It is officially the weekend and hence breakfast, dinner, lunch, supper, brunch, etc hold little meaning

[23:47] <Limbic_Region> I eat when I am hungry

[23:49] <offby1> that's crazy talk

[23:50] <Limbic_Region> so if I am hungry only once, what do you call that meal?  Or better, if I am hungry 24 times, do you give each of those meals a different name?

[23:50] <veritos> Limbic_Region: and what about second breakfast?

[23:51] <thorat> Limbic_Region: single man, are you? (standard Jay Leno joke)

[23:52] <Limbic_Region> veritos - second breakfast only comes up when I am picnicing in the brier

[23:53] <Limbic_Region> thorat - effectively single until Monday
