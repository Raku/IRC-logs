[08:37] <tene> jisom_: you must be new here.

[08:37] <jisom_> I work with parrot more than pugs

[08:37] <jisom_> was hoping to steal it

[08:37] <tene> Welcome to #perl6, where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a commit bit.

[08:37] <moritz> ;)

[08:38] <jisom_> of all the little things I've done for parrot, I never even added myself, I think leo did

[08:39] <audreyt> jisom_: anyway, the test you add will be reused on parrot end anyway (as soon as patrick makes 01-sanity pass), so why not :)

[08:40] <moritz> audreyt: are you at home again?

[08:40] <moritz> audreyt: or still in the hospital?

[08:45] <jisom_> S03 seems to say nothing

[08:45] <jisom_> at least not explicitly

[08:45] <audreyt> which means it's same with p5

[08:46] <audreyt> (anything not explicitly said as changed is assumed to be unchanged)

[08:46] <jisom_> ok

[08:47] <audreyt> the implementation is in.

[08:47] <svnbot6> r15324 | audreyt++ | * Support for the full test of file test operators: oRWXOlpSbctugkTB

[08:47] <svnbot6> r15324 | audreyt++ |   (the rest were already supported.)  For example:

[08:47] <svnbot6> r15324 | audreyt++ |     "README" ~~ :T      # True

[08:47] <svnbot6> r15324 | audreyt++ |   Thanks to jisom++ for prompting it.

[08:47] <audreyt> *full set

[08:48] <audreyt> as for implementation -- note that pugs always embed perl5 :)

[08:48] <audreyt> # so this is just a perl5 bridge

[08:48] <moritz> ;)

[08:48] <moritz> its kind of cheating isf you ask me - but never mind ;)

[08:48] <audreyt> I mean, how else would you support the full Unicode 4.0 charnames?

[08:48] <audreyt> shipping UnicodeData.txt with pugs?

[08:49] <audreyt> it's called continuity, if you ask me :)

[08:49] <moritz> or lazyness - which is a good thing, yes ;)

[08:49] <jisom_> oh pugs isn't perl6, just a perl6 interpreter, technical difference

[08:49] <audreyt> right. gcc isn't C, either.

[08:49] <jisom_> but written in c

[08:50] <jisom_> so is c

[08:50] <audreyt> eventually pugs will be written in perl6, but the plan is still to embed perl5.

[08:50] <jisom_> g++ is probably in c, but compiles c++, so not c++

[08:50] <audreyt> so sun's java is not java?

[08:50] <audreyt> parrot's tcl isn't tcl?

[08:50] <moritz> I am pretty sure that java is self-hosting

[08:50] * audreyt doesn't quite follow

[08:51] <rgs> at least, perl 5 is perl 5. probably

[08:51] <audreyt> but perl5 is written in C

[08:51] <audreyt> so it's not perl, per jisom's criteria

[08:51] <moritz> let's just redefine 'is' ;)

[23:27] <DebolazX> Out of curiosity, has anyone made any perl6/ruby comparison? Adventages/disaventages compared to each other, etc.

[23:29] <jrockway> what are you looking for in particular?

[23:29] *** CardinalNumber joined
[23:30] <moritz> perl6 is cooler, ruby is fully implemented ;)

[23:30] <DebolazX> Well, I am curious about what (perceived) adventages are with either language.. one thing that has annoyed me with ruby is the lack of variable declaration.

[23:31] <DebolazX> I'm not trying to be onesided here, there are things in perl 6 I don't like either. But I have seen several comparisons between perl 5 and ruby, so I was curious if there were any between perl 6 and ruby.

[23:32] <allbery_b> I think perl6 needs to settle down more first

[23:33] <jrockway> i would see no reason to use ruby after perl6 has stabilized

[23:34] <specbot6> r13703 | larry++ | Clarify that a named argument may name either the label or the variable name.

[23:34] <jrockway> the ruby folks are thinking about using parrot to run ruby

[23:34] <jrockway> so it will be the same VM (possibly)

[23:34] <Limbic_Region> jrockway - then you aren't thinking very polylingual

[23:34] <TimToady> and the pugs folks are thinking about using ruby to run Perl 6.  :)

[23:34] <PerlJam> jrockway: ruby may incorporate all of the things learned from perl6 by the time perl6 stablizes :)

[23:34] <Limbic_Region> jrockway - the advantage of the parrot based perl 6 implementation is that you will get to use libraries from any language that target parrot

[23:34] <TimToady> well, we already know they're borrowing ->

[23:34] <jrockway> unlikely; python 3000 is as "vaporish" as perl6

[23:34] <jrockway> i don't keep up on ruby much

[23:35] <jrockway> ruby and python both have neat features that i would like to see, but not enough neat features to switch

[23:35] <jrockway> and throw away the CPAN and years of perl experience :)

[23:35] <jrockway> haskell OTOH i quite like, and it will tide me over until perl6 is real

[23:35] <PerlJam> jrockway: what do you mean "switch"?  I program in perl.  I program in php.  I program in python.  I soon will program in ruby.   These are not mutually exclusive things  :-)

[23:36] <jrockway> no, but why bother (is what i ask myself)

[23:36] <jrockway> why write something in ruby when i can do it 3x faster in perl

[23:36] <jrockway> it's the same end result

[23:36] <jrockway> which is why i don't really care too much about the programming language holy wars

[23:36] <PerlJam> jrockway: But the journey is different 

[23:36] <jrockway> it's what you do, not how you do it

[23:36] <PerlJam> And it's the journey that's often most important.

[23:37] <PerlJam> (now, if you're just interested in getting the results, then obviously you chose the method that works best for you)

[23:37] <jrockway> how so

[23:38] <DebolazX> In my experience, perl does most real world jobs faster than most of the other languages, in part thanks to the enormous CPAN. But disregarding external factors like that, ruby does seem awfully tempting.

[23:38] <PerlJam> jrockway: It's like a C programmer asking "Why would I ever use LISP?"     There are lessons that LISP teaches quite well as compared to C.  There are some lessons that ruby can teach you.

[23:38] <jrockway> i guess writing something in ruby or python is the same journey for me

[23:38] <jrockway> haskell feels differnt to me

[23:38] <PerlJam> (At the very least think of it as a case of "hold your friends close, but your enemies closer"  :-)

[23:38] <jrockway> so in that sense, i enjoy the journey

[23:38] <jrockway> but i don't think i would enjoy ruby

[23:38] <jrockway> it's not *that* different from perl, that's all

[23:39] <jrockway> PHP is an interesting journey, however

[23:39] <jrockway> i've learned that the perfect programming language will be the complete opposite of it :)

[23:40] <moritz> jrockway: when you've done enough CGI-stuff in perl, PHP just feels .. ugly ;)

[23:40] <jrockway> yup, my current job is all PHP (not for much longer though)

[23:41] <PerlJam> my current job is PHP too.

[23:41] <PerlJam> prior to this job, I wrote some bit of perl code practically every day for years and years.

[23:41] <PerlJam> I've written maybe 10 perl programs and maybe 20 or 30 one-liners in the last 3 months.

[23:42] <jrockway> so do you like PHP better?

[23:42] <PerlJam> no.

[23:42] <jrockway> :)

[23:42] <moritz> it would be suicide to admit it in #perl* ;)

[23:42] <jrockway> there's not much to like about it :)

[23:43] <PerlJam> people who like php better don't have the breadth of knowledge from which to compare

[23:43] <jrockway> agreed

[23:43] <jrockway> i'm surprised it's so popular though

[23:43] <PerlJam> jrockway: and we're back to why you should learn ruby  ;-)

[23:43] <moritz> jrockway: it's an easy start, if you just know html

[23:44] <DebolazX> jrockway: Why? It's pretty obvious why it's so popular, it's easily deployable.

[23:44] <PerlJam> why are you surprised?  PHP is the king of ubiquity and good-enough.

[23:44] <jrockway> i'm surprised people that know better pick it (like yahoo, for example)

[23:44] <DebolazX> As opposed to perl, requiring either the ugly CGI interface or a dedicated server.

[23:44] <jrockway> they can hire some dude to keep mod_perl alive :)

[23:44] <jrockway> i'm mostly thinking about real apps

[23:44] *** __Ace__ joined
[23:44] <jrockway> not "joe's home page" or whatever

[23:44] * PerlJam wants parrot to edge into the ubiquity market though by being in web servers *and* browsers :-)

[23:45] <DebolazX> jrockway: But quantity implies popularity. A lot of people use it in general, so many people will use it for more advanced applications.

[23:45] <jrockway> sure, and it's easy to find cheap PHP programmers

[23:45] <DebolazX> Because of the quantity. 

[23:45] <jrockway> yup, same with java though

[23:45] <moritz> hey, maybe javascript on parrot could speed up mozilla & co ;)

[23:46] <jrockway> i haven't learned ruby because i don't think it would be a fundamental change in the way i think about programming 

[23:46] <PerlJam> jrockway: you're probably right about that.

[23:46] <jrockway> haskell and functional is, which has kept my interested through the no-productivity stage :)

[23:46] <DebolazX> I've talked to many perl developers who simply could not understand that easy deployment was a good thing, it seemed at the time the majority felt every application should be its own server.

[23:46] <jrockway> hmm

[23:47] *** CardinalNumber is now known as ProperNoun

[23:47] <jrockway> i PAR up my perl apps, run svc -t appname, and i'm done

[23:47] <jrockway> that's much easier than the various issues I have to fight with in PHP

[23:47] <jrockway> php.ini, etc.

[23:47] <PerlJam> DebolazX: see RoR and Jifty  :-)

[23:47] <jrockway> catalyst :)

[23:47] <DebolazX> RoR/Jifty/Catalyst isn't easily deployable compared to PHP.

[23:48] <DebolazX> For the poor soab admin running the public hosting service most people use. 

[23:48] <jrockway> i don't think easy deployment is worth the random major security problems, the lack of a sane language, no modules, etc.

[23:48] <jrockway> i guess that's the php culture

[23:49] <jrockway> "do most of the work, screw getting it right"

[23:49] <jrockway> compare DateTime to php's date/time functions

[23:49] <jrockway> datetime is bloated because date/time is a hard problem

[23:49] <jrockway> however, it's easy if you don't think about it

[23:49] <jrockway> and the bugs probably won't be *too* bad

[23:49] <PerlJam> jrockway: such things didn't hinder Microsoft and they certainly won't hinder php.

[23:49] <jrockway> so PHP wins

[23:49] <jrockway> yeah, i'm not sure i really care about PHP's success

[23:50] <jrockway> i'll have a nice Perl job in the future, and there's enough activity in the perl community to keep me very interested

[23:50] <jrockway> and that's all i need really

[23:50] <PerlJam> jrockway: what's the perl job?

[23:50] <DebolazX> jrockway: I'm not saying PHP is great as a language. I'm not saying there aren't various horrible things about its implementation. I'm saying that it beat perl on quantity through easy deployment. It was leaps and bounds better than CGI for most people, and there were few alternatives.

[23:50] <PerlJam> (and can you work parrot/perl6 into it?  ;-)

[23:50] <jrockway> PerlJam: well, i'm looking at 2 right now

[23:51] <jrockway> one is data warehousing, the other is working with $UNNAMED_MEMBER_OF_PERL6_COMMUNITY

[23:51] <jrockway> details after i make a decision :)

[23:51] <PerlJam> jrockway: depending on the latter, that's the one I'd choose.

[23:51] <jrockway> yeah, the data warehousing one would be cool

[23:52] <jrockway> but they're making me sign away my life, which scares me

[23:52] <PerlJam> "We own your soul"  sign and date below.

[23:52] <jrockway> anything that's not PHP is worth it, though, IMHO

[23:52] <jrockway> i'm just not very productive with PHP, and that bugs me

[23:53] <PerlJam> I've actually experienced a little of that in this PHP job.  But my productivity has improved the more I use it.

[23:54] <PerlJam> The thing that bugs me most about PHP right now is the lack of mnemonic cues.

[23:54] <jrockway> i miss Test::More and having a framework

[23:54] <jrockway> i like catalyst; not using it seems mildly insane to me

[23:57] <jrockway> and unfortunately i'm getting the urge more and more to rewrite parts in haskell :)

[23:57] <jrockway> i remember an hour long meeting about how to represent things like "Winter 2007" in the application

[23:57] <jrockway> data Term a = Spring a | Summer a | Fall a | Winter a deriving (Read, Show, Eq) and we're done :)

[23:58] <jrockway> unfortunately we now have an entire class, filled with random PHP and database workarounds

[23:58] <jrockway> ah, i have to go... going to miss the train :)
