[04:25] <japhb> dduncan: last time I did an apples-to-apples comparison of P5 and P6 code, I found Pugs to be about 1000x slower than perl. 

[04:27] <japhb> That was after the pad refactor merge, but before any further merging that audreyt may have done (since svnbot6 has been so spotty, I have no idea if she ever got around to the O(1) pad and MO merges, both of which had a pretty good chance of affecting my performance)

[04:42] <dduncan> japhb, thanks for your observations

[04:43] <dduncan> how big was the code base you tested?

[04:44] <dduncan> speaking conservatively, I would say the one I tested was about 100KB, not including docs/comments

[04:45] <dduncan> that is, each version was about its own 100KB

[04:46] <dduncan> this all said, regardless of numbers, there certainly feels like a world of difference in speed right now

[04:58] <meppl> good morning

[08:19] <spinclad> nice

[08:19] <agentzh> he asked me when perl 6 will be out and he had got a bit impatient ;)

[08:21] <spinclad> this is the False Impatience

[08:21] <agentzh> he told me that he learned OCaml because the "camel" thing made him believe that it must have something to do with Perl.

[08:22] <spinclad> an accidental benefit to him then

[08:22] <agentzh> indeed.

[08:22] <agentzh> now they're running a perl + ocaml + js platform for their backend system.

[09:16] <sunnavy> :-) I'll try that, aha.

[09:16] <moritz> the "perl 6 is cool" part is the more important, actually

[09:25] <Aankhen``> Oooh, might need a fair bit of updating.

[14:01] <aharoni> is there a version of GHC especially for cygwin, or should i just use the regular Win32 GHC installer from the cygwin shell?

[14:03] <aharoni> i mean install GHC from the regular installer and _then_ use it from the cygwin shell

[14:04] *** franck__ joined
[14:04] <gaal> aharoni: wow, I haven't tried building in GHC in a while. Basically: use the regular win32 GHC, and use it from the cygwin shell, yes

[14:04] * moritz doesn't know

[14:04] <gaal> this may need some love though.

[14:04] <gaal> *in cygwin

[14:05] <gaal> you may have better success with a native win32 perl5, for example any of activeperl, strawberry perl, or a perl you had built yourself

[14:06] <aharoni> it's a terrible pain to install CPAN modules with ActivePerl.

[14:06] <gaal> i can confirm the last choice works with a perl5 built with the free microsoft tools

[14:06] <aharoni> cygwin perl has its issues with CPAN, but not as bad as ActivePerl

[14:06] <gaal> aharoni: then give strawberry perl a whirl

[14:06] <gaal> that also worked for me

[14:07] <gaal> i mean, there's no innate reason why it *shouldn't* work for you with cygwin, so perhaps yes, try that first :)

[14:07] <aharoni> i haven't tried building all of pugs, but simple stuff GHCi stuff works

[14:08] <gaal> but be prepared to tweak the makefile and util/ to probably add cygpath directives here and there in forgotten places

[14:08] <aharoni> am i the first one to try it??

[14:09] <gaal> certainly not! but i don't know if anyone did it in a while.

[17:31] *** isaacd__ joined
[17:31] <gaal> A Sterne influence would have been amusing, though...

[17:34] <TimToady> considering T&I is a medieval story, any influence probably went the other direction

[17:35] <TimToady> but it's also possible the old name mutated in the direction of a more familiar name over time

[17:35] *** dduncan joined
[17:35] <TimToady> or was just confused

[17:36] <TimToady> It's really amazing how many chinese characters arose by confusion with other characters...

[17:36] <gaal> I was referring to an influence on your choice of spelling, but never mind :)

[17:36] <TimToady> I know, which is why I said "the other direction"

[17:37] <gaal> is it? I mean, much change in language is caused by what contemporaries might call mistakes, no?

[17:37] <TimToady> but I really don't know enough about the history of the names to know if they're one name that diverged or two names that converged

[17:38] <TimToady> I think most change is caused by kids hearing what their parents say but reanalyzing it differently in their heads.

[17:39] <TimToady> not sure I'd call that a "mistake"
