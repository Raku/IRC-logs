[06:23] <svnbot6> r14974 | agentz++ | - fixed the link for S26 (Documentation.pod)

[06:23] <svnbot6> r14974 | agentz++ | since we don't have a perl 6 POD HTMLifier atm, plain POD

[06:23] <svnbot6> r14974 | agentz++ | is preserved.

[06:29] <svnbot6> r14975 | agentz++ | - removed markstos' comments since i've already fixed the

[06:29] <svnbot6> r14975 | agentz++ | - made it explicit that S26 is in Perl 6 POD.

[06:34] <Alias_> Is there a graph anywhere of committers and commits?

[06:34] <Alias_> I saw at one point ages ago Audreyt had one

[06:47] <dduncan> just a minute ... I may know where one is ...

[06:52] <Alias_> ta, looking

[06:52] <Alias_> Wow, not many comments

[06:52] <Alias_> Is it just misparsing?

[06:57] <wolverian> doesn't read haskell, eh? :)

[06:57] <dduncan> nope ... I did say it was far from flawless

[13:32] <LeeD> hi, I have some trouble on compile pugs(r14975) with embeded parrot

[13:32] <LeeD> after enable embeded parrot, I find some include path is wrong

[13:33] <LeeD> at line 446 of Makefile.PL, 

[13:33] <LeeD> my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parr

[13:33] <LeeD> ot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'inc');'inc');'inc');'inc');'inc');

[13:34] <LeeD> this will generate wrong include path, like /home/lee/parrot/workinginclude

[13:35] <LeeD> but after I fix this Makefile.PL, I got more compile error

[13:35] <LeeD> like this

[13:36] <LeeD> [ 1 of 96] Compiling UTF8             ( src/UTF8.hs, dist/build/UTF8.o )

[13:36] <LeeD> In file included from /home/lee/parrot/working/include/parrot/string.h:17,

[13:36] <LeeD> from /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.6/include/HsBase.h:59,

[13:37] <LeeD> from /tmp/ghc11400_0/ghc11400_0.hc:4:0:

[13:37] <LeeD> and something like this

[13:38] <LeeD> ghc use parrot's string.h instead of /usr/include/string.h

[13:40] <LeeD> Anyone see this problem before?

[13:41] <LeeD> line 446 of Makefile.PL is

[13:43] <cognominal> that was   ./Configure -Dmad  # and one must not set PERL_MADSKILLS and PERL_XMLDUMP before compilation

[13:46] <LeeD> my $include_path = parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'prefix') . parrot_config($base, $parrot_config, 'inc');

[21:20] <riffraff> it is a proposal? I thought it was specced out since the beginning

[21:24] <allbery_b> no, someone recently asked on the mailing list if such a thing (he called it "was_taken") might be considered
