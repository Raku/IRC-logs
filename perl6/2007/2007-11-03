[01:14] <jimm> Limbic_Region: dog food, soup... still, it's consumable...

[01:15] <Limbic_Region> there are a few here dogfooding it but mostly they keep changing the recipe

[01:17] <jimm> hmm, ok

[01:19] *** cookys left
[01:19] <jimm> so does that mean what's primarily changing is the way the consumer would see it, or more about its composition?

[08:35] <agentzh> dduncan: are you still working on your RDB wrapper project?

[08:35] <dduncan> yes

[08:36] <agentzh> haven't seen your commits recently ;)

[08:36] <agentzh> has your code moved out of the pugs repos?

[08:36] <dduncan> the project is split between a language def repo and an impl repo ... only the latter has a version in pugs, and the former presently gets more commits

[08:36] <agentzh> url?

[08:37] <dduncan> have a look at http://utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/

[08:37] <lambdabot> Title: utsl.gen.nz git -

[08:37] <dduncan> 2 projects named 'Muldis'

[08:37] <dduncan> everything is currently either there or with Pugs

[08:38] <agentzh> thanks :)

[08:38] <dduncan> the versions in gitweb are also put on cpan regularly

[08:38] <agentzh> i'll try to find if i can use your work or your ideas in our company :)

[08:38] <dduncan> I've been slower in the last few weeks due to time conflicts, but I'm trying to get a lot done on it in the next few days

[08:38] *** franck___ joined
[08:39] <dduncan> agentzh, are you on any email lists where I've been posting about the releases?

[08:39] <agentzh> we are running hundreds or thousands of postgres databases in the company

[08:39] <dduncan> yes

[08:39] <agentzh> dduncan: not any that i'm aware of

[08:40] <dduncan> I usually post about releases on the dbix-class list, plus the lists I setup specifically for muldis-db itself

[08:40] <agentzh> dduncan: cool. i'll subscribe to that list.

[08:40] <dduncan> agentzh, what ideas in particular from my project were you wanting to make use of?

[08:41] <agentzh> dduncan: good abstraction :)

[08:41] <dduncan> yes

[08:41] <agentzh> dduncan: w/o much penalty of performance

[08:42] <agentzh> that's why i love compilers in (general) so much ;)

[08:42] <dduncan> in particular, I see a unique feature of my project in that stored procedures are abstracted, in fact Muldis DB is focused around the paradigm of putting everything in stored procedures as possible

[08:42] <dduncan> unlike all the others

[08:42] <agentzh> that sounds sweet :)

[08:42] <dduncan> would you like to help me with the development?

[08:43] <agentzh> dduncan: i'd love to but i think i should take a closer first ;)

[08:43] <agentzh> *closer look

[08:43] <dduncan> eg, if you want to send me details of use cases that I can try coding cookbook examples out of or tests, that would be helpful ... also if you want to help test

[08:43] <dduncan> "use cases" meaning for relational databases in general

[08:44] <agentzh> i'll have a try :)

[08:44] <dduncan> do you know my email address?

[08:44] <agentzh> no

[08:44] <dduncan> for that matter, what's yours?

[08:44] <agentzh> [email@hidden.address] :)

[08:45] <agentzh> i think it's not hard at all to find out your email address ;)

[08:45] <agentzh> there's CPAN and google :)

[08:45] *** iblechbot joined
[08:46] <dduncan> I just sent you a test email, try replying to it

[08:46] <agentzh> k

[08:46] <dduncan> that email is the longer version of what I just asked of you

[08:46] <dduncan> about use cases

[08:46] <agentzh> already sent?

[08:46] <dduncan> yes

[08:47] <dduncan> the SMTP server may take a few minutes

[08:47] <agentzh> ah...okay

[08:47] <agentzh> hopefully it's not the problem on my side ;)

[08:47] <dduncan> I recently switched to using my ISP's one, since they were blocking the normal SMTP port

[08:47] *** cognominal_ joined
[08:47] <agentzh> or try this one instead?

[08:48] <agentzh> [email@hidden.address]
[08:48] <dduncan> will do ...

[08:48] <agentzh> okay, already got your mail :)

[08:48] <dduncan> then I won't

[08:48] <agentzh> :)

[08:48] <agentzh> yahoo.cn worked :)

[08:49] *** rindolf joined
[08:49] <agentzh> very interesting stuff although you've changed its name several times, which leads to a little confusion ;)

[08:50] <agentzh> i'll give you some feedback when i read enough about your baby :)

[08:50] <agentzh> thanks for the info you've provided :)

[08:50] <dduncan> one thing you should know, or it may have been implied, is that the Muldis DB interface is optimized towards declaring all your queries up front as part of your database schema, such that they are stored procedures, and so all you typically do at runtime is invoke stored procedures rather than doing select/iud etc

[08:51] <agentzh> *nod* that's also one of the best practices we've been promoting within our company ;)

[08:51] *** the_dormant left
[08:51] <rindolf> Hi all.

[08:52] <dduncan> hi rindolf

[08:52] <agentzh> dduncan: i mean using stored procedures as much as possible

[08:52] <agentzh> hey, rindolf

[08:52] <dduncan> yes

[08:52] <rindolf> agentzh: what's up?

[08:52] <rindolf> dduncan: what's up?

[08:52] <dduncan> I'm replying to you

[08:52] <dduncan> besides that ...

[08:52] <agentzh> lol

[08:52] <dduncan> I just did a commit to my language design regarding the entity names docs in Basics.pod

[08:53] * agentzh loves docs.

[08:53] <dduncan> basically improving how the entity namespace of Muldis D is meant to map to typical DBMS backends

[08:53] <agentzh> what do you mean by entities in this context?

[08:53] <dduncan> tomorrow I expect to start doing a top-down design of the system catalog

[08:54] <agentzh> as in entity-relation?

[08:54] <dduncan> no

[08:54] <dduncan> entity, as in some named thing, like a variable or data type or routine

[08:54] <agentzh> ah, okay :)

[08:55] <dduncan> I use "entity" to describe something in the programming language or database that can be invoked or referred to

[08:55] <agentzh> it makes sense

[08:55] <dduncan> oh, and I use the word "relation" to mean what SQL means when it says "table" or "rowset"

[08:56] <agentzh> heh

[08:56] <dduncan> that'll be fun for users

[08:56] <dduncan> used to typical Perl ORMs

[08:56] <agentzh> hmm

[08:57] <dduncan> or I should say, a "relation value" is a rowset, a "relation variable" is a table

[08:57] <dduncan> the result of a select is a relation

[08:57] * agentzh tries to get used to these terms.

[08:58] *** blindfish joined
[08:58] <agentzh> dduncan: btw, how far is your system from being used in production?

[08:58] <dduncan> my language actually defines its terms where there may be confusion; see the top of Basics.pod

[08:58] <dduncan> hard to say

[08:58] <dduncan> a few months is probably the most realistic answer

[08:58] <dduncan> but I hope to have something useful for testing in a few weeks

[08:59] <agentzh> dduncan: great :)

[08:59] <agentzh> dduncan: something runnable is always nice :)

[08:59] <dduncan> hopefully once the earlier milestone is reached, people will jump on board like they did for Pugs when it could say "hello world"

[09:00] <agentzh> if i find something particularly useful in your design, i may steal it, implement it quickly myself, and use it in production directly ;)

[09:00] <dduncan> I would compare most of my work so far to be analagous to Larry's writing of the Apocalypses ... or Synopsis

[09:01] <agentzh> heh, that may be sufficient for my purpose ;)

[09:01] <dduncan> suit yourself, though I would hope that your work could merge with mine some day as is appropriate

[09:01] <agentzh> dduncan: i hope so as well :)

[09:01] <dduncan> by the way, is the LGPLv3+ license suitable for you?

[09:01] <agentzh> i think yes :)

[09:02] <dduncan> good, that

[09:03] <dduncan> agentzh, what time is it over there?

[09:03] <agentzh> we're very willing to contribute back to opensource projects that we've found useful :)

[09:03] <agentzh> 17:03

[09:03] <dduncan> its 02:03 here

[09:03] <dduncan> so I'm about to lay

[09:03] <agentzh> oh!

[09:03] <agentzh> sorry

[09:03] <agentzh> sleep well, dduncan :)

[09:03] <dduncan> but that's fine, I often keep late nights, and realize that some of you are only around now

[09:04] <agentzh> hehe

[09:04] <dduncan> on that note, do you know what's up with audrey?

[09:04] <agentzh> audreyt is still recovering very slowly

[09:04] <agentzh> she's quit excitement

[09:04] <dduncan> afaik, audrey was attending some family matter, and didn't really come back

[09:04] <agentzh> but she has not quit pressure

[09:05] <agentzh> as she recently said on #jifty

[09:05] <agentzh> family matter?

[09:05] <dduncan> I'm not sure, maybe something about a sick relative?

[09:06] <agentzh> i think it's herself :)

[09:06] <dduncan> back to my project, I'm unlikely to change its name again ... this very week I'm now registering a business with the name 'Muldis', and shortly after trying to trademark the term (in Canada anyway)

[09:06] <agentzh> wow

[09:06] <dduncan> and I registered lots of generic TLDs for it a few years ago

[09:07] <dduncan> assuming the business gets setup properly, I'll update my docs to reference it as a place to get support soon

[09:07] *** jisom left
[09:08] <agentzh> cool

[09:08] <dduncan> rather than referencing my personal name

[09:08] *** jisom joined
[09:08] <agentzh> so you'll soon be self-employed?

[09:08] <dduncan> yes, moreover, incorporated

[09:08] <agentzh> heh

[09:08] <agentzh> congrats :)

[09:09] <dduncan> so, during what hours in your own timezone are you typically responsive on this channel?

[09:09] <dduncan> myself, typically from noon to midnight my time

[09:09] <dduncan> plus or minus a few hours

[09:09] <agentzh> for me, 10:00 ~ 18:00 beijing time
