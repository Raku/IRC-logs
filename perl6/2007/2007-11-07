[18:09] <moritz_> I noticed that you have to run 'make' twice after forcerecompile

[18:11] * dlocaus wonders if a directory could be jinxed.

[18:12] <moritz_> dlocaus: after a recompile it works fine for me

[18:12] <fglock> MiniPerl6 requires 2 compilation cycles

[18:13] <dlocaus> I'm wondering if that is what is doing it, I'm not compiling it twice.

[18:13] <fglock> the first compilation compiles the compiler, and the second compiles the runtime using the new compiler

[18:14] *** rindolf joined
[18:14] <fglock> hmm - this sounds confusing

[18:14] <dlocaus> fglock: is there some way of fixing the Makefile.PL so it does it twice automatically for us?

[18:16] <fglock> not sure how to do it, mp6 uses a separate script for bootstrapping

[18:17] <fglock> but kp6 should not require 2 cycles yet, because it still uses mp6

[18:17] <dlocaus> Ah ha!

[18:17] <dlocaus> I think I've got it

[18:23] <fglock> it would be better to create a whole new compiled/, and later move it to the right place

[18:23] <dlocaus>  ;)

[18:24] <fglock> trying out -j

[18:24] <dlocaus> it works, I've done it without -j several times.

[18:24] <fglock> yes - it doesn't work

[18:24] <fglock> I mean, -j doesn't work here

[18:24] <dlocaus> which, was why I was thinking that the directory was jinxed.  I was doing it differently

[18:25] * moritz_ takes the blame, but points out that if the dependencies in Makefile were specified complete it wouldn't break

[18:25] <moritz_> s/complete/completely/

[18:26] <fglock> I think it is trying to overwrite files that are in use

[18:26] <fglock> it can't compile to Array.pm because there is another compiler using Array.pm

[18:27] <fglock> so we really need a temp directory

[18:50] <dlocaus> The problem is understand what is doing what.  Given that one language is compiled to parse another language and then perl6 code is translated/compiled into perl5 code to provide runtime for perl6 code hasn't been making things easy ;)

[19:43] <pugs_svn> r18822 | fglock++ | [kp6] set html docs to "text/html"

[19:44] <pmurias> fglock: the eval should be removed as it is puzzling and possibly slowe

[19:45] <dlocaus> yea!

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | [kp6]

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | 

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | script/mp6.pl now will use Perl::Tidy if available to clean up produced files.

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | 

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | script/mp6.pl now accepts a --noperltidy option

[19:46] <dlocaus> that was an odd pain in the butt.

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | 

[19:46] <pugs_svn> r18823 | dlo++ | mp6.pl produces the exact same output with or without perltidy as the old mp6.pl file does.

[19:46] <fglock> pmurias: I'll investigate that - probably needs more tests to be sure

[19:47] <pmurias> you could remove it and test if everthing works 

[19:47] <fglock> dlocaus: cool

[19:47] <fglock> pmurias: right now perl5rx is broken by the delimiter bug; it needs to be fixed first

[19:48] <fglock> so we can actually run big tests

[19:52] <fglock> pmurias: is it ok to move tokeninline into scripts/ ?

[19:53] <fglock> and kp6-token-debug

[19:53] <pmurias> fglock: yes

[20:15] <pugs_svn> r18825 | dlo++ | [KP6] I updated Makefile.PL to take advantage of script/mp6.pl perltidy change (last commit?).  These files are

[20:15] <pugs_svn> r18825 | dlo++ | changed as a result of perltidy being run on them.  At least for the files I checked, the changes appear to be

[20:19] <gbacon> small bug in script/kp6

[20:19] <dlocaus> gbacon: what is it?

[20:20] <gbacon> print on line 385 has a spurious comma

[20:20] <moritz_> gbacon: do you have a commit bit?

[20:20] <gbacon> prevents clisp tests from running

[20:20] <gbacon> no :-(

[20:20] <moritz_> gbacon: /msg me your email and desired nick

[20:20] <moritz_> and you'll get one

[20:21] <pugs_svn> r18826 | dlo++ | [kp6] removed misplaced comma, (gbacon++)

[20:21] <dlocaus> commited

[20:22] <nwc10> In Perl 6, if you do the Perl 6 equivalent of the Perl 5 my $foo = \&bar;

[20:22] <nwc10> does it have a side effect equivalent to the Perl 6 equivalent of the Perl 5 sub bar;

[20:22] <nwc10> ie, does taking a reference to a function implicitly declare a stub that affects method resolution?

[20:23] <pmurias> nwc10: no

[20:23] <moritz_> no, it doesn't

[20:23] <nwc10> OK.

[20:23] <pmurias> it's my $foo = &bar;

[20:23] <nwc10> what happends in Perl 6 if you try to invoke the subroutine via the reference and it does not exist?

[20:23] <moritz_> gbacon: it's a custom to add your name to AUTHORS as a first commit (and commit test at the same time)

[20:24] <moritz_> nwc10: it dies 

[20:24] <pmurias> nwc10: you can't take a reference to subroutine which does not exist

[20:24] <moritz_> nwc10: at the time of referecing it, not at calling time

[20:24] <nwc10> um. AUTODLOAD/

[20:24] <nwc10> you can in Perl 5.

[20:24] <moritz_> aye

[20:25] <gbacon> roger

[20:25] <moritz_> perl 6 breaks compatibility deliberately

[20:25] <nwc10> so you get a reference that will die always? even if you later define sub bar {...}

[20:25] <moritz_> nwc10: no, you get an compile time error in the line of the assignment

[20:25] <nwc10> Ah.

[20:25] <nwc10> that's what you meant by "it dies" :-)

[20:25] <moritz_> my $foo = &nonexisting_sub; files

[20:25] <moritz_> s/files/fails/

[20:26] <moritz_> English is hard ;)

[20:26] <nwc10> ah. interesting.

[20:26] <nwc10> Um. typing is hard too. I'm a native speaker and my fingers still do that sort of thing for me. :-)

[20:26] <moritz_> ;-)

[20:26] <moritz_> that's because you're not a native writer ;)

[20:28] <pmurias> native typer

[20:28] <pmurias> * typist

[20:28] <moritz_> typo!

[20:28] <pugs_svn> r18827 | dlo++ | [kp6] updated the Makefile.PL documentation to include note about forcerecompile and make -j

[20:30] <nwc10> thanks

[20:31] <pugs_svn> r18828 | dlo++ | [kp6] changed _patsubst_wildcard subroutine documetnation from POD to comments, so the documentation will not mess up existing Makefile.PL POD documentation

[20:43] <gbacon> whee!

[20:43] <moritz_> gbacon: welcome to Perl 6 development!

[20:44] <gbacon> feels great

[20:45] <moritz_> I never planned joining the development.. then I wanted to test pugs, and reported a dead link here

[20:45] <moritz_> somehow I never left that channel ;)

[20:45] <gbacon> I was active on p5p a few years ago

[20:45] <gbacon> I miss it

[20:46] <gbacon> is most kp6 development done on sbcl?

[20:46] <gbacon> clisp builds take a little tweaking

[20:47] <moritz_> most of kp6 dev is done with the perl5 backend ;)

[20:47] *** blindfish left

[20:50] <moritz_> but any clisp fixes are welcome as well

[20:50] <pmurias> of course

[20:53] <fridim> I wish I could help writting perl5 code. Someone would tell me : we need a function that takes this type of argument, and it returns this, or do this work, but I guess it is not that simple :)

[20:53] <moritz_> fridim: sadly that's true most of the time

[20:53] <fridim> I am very bad at reading other people code

[20:53] <moritz_> fridim: but you could find simple builtin functions to implement

[20:54] <moritz_> fridim: for example List.shuffle might be a good starting point

[20:54] <moritz_> you could implement that in pure perl 6 in the Runtime::Perl6::Array in kp6

[20:55] *** cognominal_ left
[20:55] <moritz_> or a pure perl random number generator

[20:55] <fridim> oh

[20:55] <moritz_> or any method from S29 that doesn't look too complicated

[20:55] <moritz_> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S29.html

[20:55] <lambdabot> Title: S29

[20:55] *** devogon left
[20:55] <fridim> random number generator, using modulo :]

[20:56] <moritz_> fridim: that's a starting point, yes

[20:56] <moritz_> it's not very elaborate, but it works

[20:56] <fridim> what do you mean?

[20:56] <fridim> It is not a physical generator, that should work pretty well

[20:57] <moritz_> r(n) = (a * r(n-1) + b) mod limit

[20:57] <fridim> I am not sure to understand the gaol

[20:57] *** devogon joined
[20:57] <moritz_> the goal is to a) advance perl6 implementation and b) make you familiar with the code

[20:58] <fridim> it sounds good

[20:58] *** allbery_ joined
[20:59] <ggoebel> do the mp6, kp6, onion projects have a collective name?

[20:59] <lambdabot> ggoebel: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[20:59] <moritz_> they're all under v6/, so you could kinda use that as a name

[21:00] <moritz_> usually we just say kp6/mp6

[21:00] *** allbery_ is now known as allbery_b

[21:01] <fridim> I saw "clisp". Is perl6 code transformed into lisp code and then compiled?

[21:02] <moritz_> that's one of the options of kp6, yes

[21:02] <fridim> s/Is perl6 code/Can perl6 code be/

[21:03] <fridim> ok

[21:03] <moritz_> but the backend is not yet as complete as the perl5 one

[21:03] <fridim> efforts seem to be relatively divided :)

[21:03] <moritz_> yes :/

[21:04] <moritz_> but in a volunteer's project everybod hacks what he/she likes

[21:04] <moritz_> i.e -Ofun

[21:09] <fridim> That may be some part of "divide and conquer" principle...

[21:32] <ggoebel> what was mp6 originally written in?

[21:34] <pmurias> mp6 was bootstraped by lrep

[21:34] <pmurias> which was written in perl5

[21:40] <ggoebel> so mp6 was a one off from lrep

[21:40] <ggoebel> and kp6 was a one off from mp6

[21:40] <ggoebel> and onion is a one off from kp6?
