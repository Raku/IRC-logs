[01:14] <ruoso> @tell pmurias re string: the string type must be available in stage0 as the string coercion exists there. What I'm still unsure is if the additional methods should be made available in stage0 too or only in stage1...

[01:14] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[01:15] <ruoso> @tell pmurias but anyway, I'm quite convinced that there's no harm in making the stage0 rich of this helper methods, as they will be transparently available to the higher level...

[01:16] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[15:41] <aaron_TeeJay> hi all

[15:41] <aaron_TeeJay> http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?how_to_start_a_perl_6_module_project is a bit bare - anywhere else I can get info on creating/porting a cpan module to perl 6?

[15:41] <lambdabot> Title: How to Start a Perl 6 module project / Perl 6, http://tinyurl.com/26luq8

[15:42] <aaron_TeeJay> chapter 12 - packages, etc is also empty in the pugs svn - is there something useful somewhere else?

[15:46] <Limbic_Region> you mean the S12

[15:46] <Limbic_Region> see http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S12.html

[15:46] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 12: Objects - perl6

[15:47] <aaron_TeeJay> yers

[15:47] <Limbic_Region> also, if you want to see examples of perl 6 ish modules

[15:47] <Limbic_Region> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/ext/

[15:47] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 19286: /ext

[15:47] <Limbic_Region> of course, those may be a bit stale

[15:47] <aaron_TeeJay> right

[15:47] <aaron_TeeJay> joy

[15:47] <aaron_TeeJay> baby is asleep (crosses fingers)

[15:47] <Limbic_Region> most of the development in pugs these days is in ancillory projects and not pugs itself

[15:48] <Limbic_Region> my baby is grunting and groaning (bad gas)

[15:48] <Limbic_Region> my toddler is watching Charlie Brown Christmas

[15:48] <aaron_TeeJay> thought I'd do some work on the "what can I do with perl 6 today" page/chart I mentioned on the perl6-users list

[15:49] <Limbic_Region> well, writing perl 6 code is definately a GREAT way to help

[15:49] <Limbic_Region> it does lots of things

[15:49] <Limbic_Region> it helps find where users are going to be confused - and hence ask questions

[15:49] <Limbic_Region> it helps implementers to have feature lists to implement (prioritization)

[15:49] <Limbic_Region> it helps flesh out bugs in said implementations

[15:49] <aaron_TeeJay> my plan is to create and populate a chart based on what people would be able to actually use it for today

[15:50] <Limbic_Region> it helps folks who can't be bothered to follow the synopses see real world code

[15:50] <aaron_TeeJay> I tried following the synopses when they were released

[15:50] <aaron_TeeJay> too many changes, too much to take in

[15:51] <Limbic_Region> yeah, if you watch this channel for the commits and/or the list - you will see that they have slowed dramatically

[15:51] <aaron_TeeJay> good

[15:51] <Limbic_Region> this could be for a number of reasons

[15:51] <aaron_TeeJay> feh

[15:51] <Limbic_Region> TimToady is mostly enjoying the holidays with his family and not working on design

[15:51] <Limbic_Region> TimToady is spending all his time thinking about longest token matcher

[15:51] * aaron_TeeJay is self employed and doesn't get much holiday at all

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> Design is pretty much complete and it is now just being fine tuned

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> some other reason I haven't thought of

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[15:52] <aaron_TeeJay> any perl6 stuff I do has to fit into small windows of time I have available

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> well, I took a 6 week "vacation" to help my wife with the birth of our second daughter

[15:52] <aaron_TeeJay> I had a similar plan

[15:52] <aaron_TeeJay> it didn't work

[15:53] * aaron_TeeJay planned a load of extra work before she was due so I could cover a couple of months paternity leave

[15:53] <aaron_TeeJay> guess what happened

[15:53] <aaron_TeeJay> baby arrived 6 weeks early

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> she gave birth early?

[15:53] <aaron_TeeJay> :)

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> yep

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> I hope all is well

[15:53] <aaron_TeeJay> yeah -

[15:54] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - when you backlog, I have two questions for you

[15:54] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=659502

[15:54] <lambdabot> Title: What about if (my $var = foo()) { ... }

[15:55] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - the other question is, will either binding or lazy do the the following for me  my $var = some_func();  # later on if $var eq 'foo' # defer assigning $var's value until it is asked for

[15:56] <aaron_TeeJay> gah

[15:56] <Limbic_Region> TimToady - i doubt binding is what I am after since it changes containers but I am not seeing a good example of lazy in the operators synopsis

[15:56] <Limbic_Region> gah?

[15:57] <aaron_TeeJay> apparently I can't register on the perl 6 wiki because there is already an account for that email address (i.e. the perl 5 wiki), but I can't log in either because there is no account for that email address (i.e. the perl 6 wiki)

[15:57] <Limbic_Region> not quite a catch-22 but effectively the same result

[15:58] * aaron_TeeJay has a cunning plan that involves getting very drunk with prostitutes and selling a lot of grocerys

[15:58] <aaron_TeeJay> or is that blackadder

[16:00] <aaron_TeeJay> (hosted gmail)++ # as if by magic, the new email address worked

[16:25] <Limbic_Region> what's your email?

[16:25] <Limbic_Region> ok - well, I just gave you the link too

[16:31] <aaron_TeeJay> so whats a progessive power set - 2^n for 1 .. inf ?

[16:34] <Limbic_Region> progressive just means how it is ordered

[16:34] <aaron_TeeJay> right

[16:34] <Limbic_Region> it is just the powerset in a specific ordering

[16:34] <aaron_TeeJay> hmm

[16:34] <Limbic_Region> I sent you the email, which explains why that is important
