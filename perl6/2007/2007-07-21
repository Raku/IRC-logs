[09:35] <masak> python and ruby has dropped them

[09:35] <masak> and php uses it without understanding why

[09:35] <masak> perl uses it to distinguish scalars, arrays, hashes

[11:14] <TimToady> bloonix: positional args aren't composable.  BUILD is required to be named, and the default new can only understand named, but you are free to write your own new in any order you like.

[11:15] <bloonix> TimToady: I dont understand what "named" means :/

[11:16] <TimToady> well, first, you can't put a submethod into a module, because it needs a class instead, presumably with some attributes

[11:16] <TimToady> it's the names of the attributes that you use

[11:17] <TimToady> class Point { has $.x; has $.y; }; Point.new(x => 1, y => 2)

[11:23] <bloonix> I have to read S12 again do understand the difference between modules | classes !

[11:24] <bloonix> or maybe another synopsis is better?

[11:25] <TimToady> @tell masak two other reasons for sigils: to distinguish nouns from verbs (the absence of the sigil indicating either a verb or a type) and finally sigils open up an extensible namespace for twigils, in case you want to add more weirdly scoped variables

[11:25] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[11:25] <TimToady> bloonix: yes, the synopses tend to be long on what and short on why

[11:26] <TimToady> biab

[11:26] <bloonix> synopsis => what, apocalype => why ?

[11:27] <bloonix> what and why

[11:27] <bloonix> where can I look for a description "why" class and "why" module ?

[11:32] <TimToady> a module is really just a package with a different name so that we can 1) distinguish p5 from p6 and 2) have a different export mechanism

[11:32] <bloonix> why is that possible?

[11:33] <bloonix> it shouldn't, or?

[11:33] <TimToady> shouldn't I think

[11:39] <TimToady> basically, p5 didn't distinguish packages from classes, and it turned out to be very confusing, along with not distinguishing subs from methods.

[11:40] <TimToady> arguably, since a class can also be used as a module, modules are redundant

[11:40] <TimToady> and since we fixed sub vs method, less confusing

[11:41] <TimToady> but I think it's useful to be able to group non-OO subs in a place that explicitly indicates no constructors need be autogenerated

[11:41] <TimToady> package is the same as module, but doesn't support "is export"

[11:41] <TimToady> taxi here &

[19:23] <pmurias> _moritz_: ruby uses sigils a bit 

[19:24] <pmurias> although their meaning is different

[19:25] <masak> pmurias: that's true. ruby uses the sigils for OO purposes

[19:25] <lambdabot> masak: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[19:25] <masak> @messages

[19:25] <lambdabot> TimToady said 8h 53s ago: two other reasons for sigils: to distinguish nouns from verbs (the absence of the sigil indicating either a verb or a type) and finally sigils open up an extensible

[19:25] <lambdabot> namespace for twigils, in case you want to add more weirdly scoped variables

[19:26] <masak> good reasons.

[19:29] <pmurias> i was blinded a bit by the lack of sigils when i looked the first few times at ruby code

[19:29] <masak> :)

[19:30] <masak> habit is an important part of language comprehension. that's why it's difficult for me nowadays to remember how little Esperanto people can understand before they've learned it
