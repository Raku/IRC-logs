[00:10] <TristinD> i'm bored.

[00:13] <diakopter> TristinD: do you have commit access?  if you don't, PM me your email address and preferred username, and I'll send you the credentials

[00:21] <diakopter> TristinD: welcome to pugs (a Perl 6 implementation).  If you like pointers as to where to start, ask here.

[00:32] <TristinD> alright, i'm ready for the pointers on where to start. what can i do now that i'm added.

[00:32] <diakopter> tradtional first task is to add yourself to AUTHORS

[00:33] <diakopter> after you've checked out the source code using subversion

[00:33] <diotalevi> which repository do I need to fetch to get the synopsis? I got a copy of pugs but it wasn't in there. Or I looked in the wrong places.

[00:34] <diakopter> they're in HTML format at http://spec.pugscode.org/

[00:35] <diakopter> but if you want to read the POD (and Perldoc) they're in 2 places

[00:35] <diotalevi> I wanted a copy in pod.

[00:36] <diakopter> 5 of them are here: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/

[00:37] <diotalevi> that is not all of them.

[00:37] <diotalevi> the rest have got to be in svn /somewhere/.

[00:37] <diakopter> they're under svn.perl.org somewhere...

[00:38] <diakopter> looking

[00:39] <diakopter> http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/

[00:46] <diotalevi> oooh.

[00:47] <diakopter> diotalevi: ?

[00:47] <diotalevi> you'd responded with the right address.

[16:42] <moritz> hi thoughtpolice 

[16:48] <thoughtpolice> moritz: had fun at, what was it, your girlfriends?

[16:49] <thoughtpolice> no #perl6 must have been pretty hard. :(

[16:49] <moritz> thoughtpolice: my girlfriend's nephew turned 1 year yesterday, and I'm still at her parent's...

[16:49] <moritz> will be a long ride home tomorrow

[16:50] <moritz> and it was fun, but pretty exhausting (all those childs make a lot of noise...)

[16:50] <moritz> and here I'm sitting in front of a windows PC, and have a few svn changes on my laptop but I can't commit them because I can't transfer the data :(

[16:52] <thoughtpolice> :(

[16:52] <moritz> why the new diff links of svnbot?

[16:52] <thoughtpolice> how long's a "long ride home" ?

[16:52] <moritz> the ones the irclogs point to are much more concise if you ask me

[16:53] <moritz> thoughtpolice: 5..7 hrs depending on traffic

[16:53] <thoughtpolice> ouch. :(

[16:53] <moritz> thoughtpolice: but a part of it is through some hills, and that's _very_ tiring :(

[16:53] <thoughtpolice> and i will give you the part on kids. they tend to make noise a lot.

[16:53] <thoughtpolice> moritz: where are you at?

[16:53] <thoughtpolice> EU?

[16:53] <moritz> thoughtpolice: yes, Germany

[16:54] <thoughtpolice> ah. i'm half german (mother's side. other half is texan.) :) if I ever go by that part of europe I'll find you and buy ya a beer.

[16:55] <moritz> thoughtpolice: I don't like beer :(, but we have at least two decent breweries in my town ;)

[16:56] <moritz> thoughtpolice: don't hesitate to visit me ;)

[16:56] <thoughtpolice> :)

[16:57] <moritz> anyway, gotta go... have fun ;)

[16:57] <moritz> &

[16:58] <thoughtpolice> later. :)

[17:58] <Juerd> IMO, at least 10% of the channel should be op

[17:59] <thoughtpolice> i hardly knew there were ops in here, personally. either that or i just didn't know who they were (besides say audreyt)

[18:00] *** Juerd sets mode: +o audreyt

[18:00] <Juerd> :{

[18:00] <Juerd> eh

[18:00] <Juerd> :(

[18:00] <Juerd> eh

[18:00] <Juerd> argh

[18:00] <Juerd> :)

[18:00] <Juerd> Now we have 6. 11 to go.

[18:06] *** scw joined
[18:11] <b_jonas> Juerd: well, chanserv shows about 9 people who have op rights

[18:11] <b_jonas> audreyt already has it

[18:11] <Gothmog_>  /who #perl6 

[18:11] <Gothmog_> Whoops.

[21:19] <TristinD> anyone working on any perl 6 projects. I need something to do

[21:19] <b_jonas> write perl6 tests

[21:30] <dduncan> for today, I second that notion

[21:30] <dduncan> in a week or so, you could help with Muldis-DB if you want ... though my earliest needs are also examples and tests

[21:34] <TristinD> Hmm. I'm still learning perl 6. I'm still living in perl 5. Ho

[21:34] <TristinD> What kind of tests are needed

[21:35] <dduncan> that's harder to say

[21:35] <dduncan> you could try ...

[21:36] <dduncan> there is some functionality in the test distro that relates the synopsis and the tests, so you can look at the synopsis and see what parts have test coverage ... but I forget where that is

[21:36] <dduncan> s/test distro/pugs distro/

[21:37] <thoughtpolice> http://perlcabal.org/syn/

[21:37] <thoughtpolice> those docs are smartlinked, so browse through the source and if you can find anything without tests, that would probably be somewhere to start

[21:37] <thoughtpolice> s/source/synopsis'/

[21:38] <dduncan> actually, look at  http://perlcabal.org/syn/

[21:38] <dduncan> er, oops

[21:40] <thoughtpolice> aw

[21:40] <thoughtpolice> lambdabot is dead. :(

[21:41] <thoughtpolice> i must have missed the eulogy. where'd he and svnbot go to this time? :/
