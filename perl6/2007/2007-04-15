[12:07] <agentzh> diakopter: smartlinks.pl is run every hour by the cron program on feather :)

[12:09] <agentzh> diakopter: feather has been reporting this error these days to me: "Can't locate Perl6/Perldoc/Parser.pm in @INC".

[12:09] <agentzh> seems like we need to install Perl6::Perldoc on feather. np, i will do.

[12:09] <agentzh> Juerd++ has given me the root access ;)

[12:18] <agentzh> is there any plan to convert all the synopses to Perl6 POD format (like S26.pod)?

[12:19] <gaal> agentzh: are you sure that's what the error means? who's issuing it? Perl6::Perldoc's a pretty new module

[12:19] <agentzh> gaal: feather

[12:19] <gaal> agentzh: the computer speaks to you? :)

[12:19] <agentzh> gaal: yes.

[12:19] <agentzh> via emails ;)

[12:20] <gaal> it must be some script, or part of the make process; but what made you conclude you need the module installed?

[12:20] <agentzh> i get one mail from feather's cron every 1 hour.

[12:20] <gaal> maybe the make just needs to be fixed.

[12:20] <agentzh> gaal: make?

[12:21] <gaal> whatever it is that's looking for that module

[12:21] *** bernhard joined
[12:21] <agentzh> that error is generated by /usr/bin/perl while trying to run smartlinks.pl :)

[12:21] <agentzh> *was

[12:22] <gaal> and smartlinks is depending on the new Perl6::Perldoc? then it should probably take it from blib/lib, not the system

[12:22] <gaal> since it appears we're hosting Perl6::Perldoc now.

[12:22] <agentzh> it makes sense :)

[12:23] <agentzh> are we?

[12:23] * agentzh goes to look into the pugs tree.

[12:24] <moritz> diakopter++ added Perl6::Perldoc to ext/ 

[12:24] <agentzh> gaal: ah, i didn't know.

[12:24] <agentzh> moritz: thanks for the info

[12:24] *** the_dormant joined
[12:24] <gaal> how did smartlinks come to depend on it?

[12:25] <agentzh> i don't know.

[12:25] <agentzh> i was not looking.

[12:25] <agentzh> maybe diakopter has patched smartlinks.pl?

[12:25] <agentzh> looking now

[12:26] <agentzh> i think right now it shouldn't depend on it.

[12:26] <moritz> I think the plan was to convert S26 from the pod6 sources to html

[12:26] <gaal> ah: it's a soft dependency; there's a warning if it's not installed.

[12:27] <agentzh> moritz: Hmm, that should have been done via a cron entry, not smartlinks.pl, i'm afraid.

[12:28] * agentzh is going to remove docs/feather/syn/

[12:28] <gaal> okay, looks like that's cleared up. back to work &

[12:28] <moritz> agentzh: it wasn't me ;-)

[12:29] <agentzh> moritz: np :) it's apparently my fault because i was not here when diakopter was asking.

[12:29] * moritz thinks "fault" is a faulty concept ;-)

[12:30] <agentzh> fixing

[12:32] <agentzh> (if @larry decides to convert all the synopses to Perl 6 POD, smartlinks.pl will need almost a thorough rewrite.)

[12:36] <agentzh> does pugs have somethings as nice as http://svn.jifty.org/index.cgi/jifty/browse/jifty ?

[12:36] <agentzh> *something

[12:37] <agentzh> if yes, tracking rev diff will be easier for me.

[12:37] <gaal> sure

[12:37] <gaal> http://dev.pugscode.org/browser

[12:37] <agentzh> gaal: thanks!

[12:37] <gaal> np

[12:46] <agentzh> Trac++ # very handy

[12:48] <agentzh> i think i should document how feather updates http://perlcabal.org/syn/*.html in pugs's docs/feather/README

[12:48] <agentzh> the syn directory is a symbolic link per se.

[13:04] <agentzh> interesting, the YAPC::Beijing committee says audreyt is their "default guest" :)

[13:04] <agentzh> she is the only one that i'm aware of. :)

[13:10] <gaal> agentzh: if you ever do get the tuits, a version of the synopses that has test results autogenerated in them would be very useful

[13:13] <svnbot6> r15917 | kudra++ | All threads which were not corrupted in the mbox have now been covered

[13:15] <agentzh> gaal: what do you mean by "autogenerated" ?

[13:15] <agentzh> let smartlinks.pl itself run the smoke?

[13:16] <agentzh> or like those on the smoke server?

[13:17] <agentzh> you mean grabbing a particular version of the smoked synopses from the smoke server onto feather?

[13:17] *** nathanael joined
[13:18] <agentzh> or let the HTML outputs have the errors (if any) generated while running smartlinks.pl itself?

[13:18] <agentzh> (the last one is a bit tricky ;))

[13:19] <gaal> agentzh: I mean either adding 'make smoke' to the current auto pugs build used for evalbot, or if we don't want to slow down evalbot turnaround, add a new autopugs instance, which does 'make smoke'.

[13:20] <agentzh> ah

[13:20] <gaal> then have the process that runs smartlinks on feather use the output of that

[13:20] <agentzh> what if the "make smoke" hangs?

[13:20] <gaal> we've had the technology for test cross-reffing for ages now, it's a pity we don't actually use it

[13:21] <agentzh> gaal: i see. you mean use the smoke results on feather.

[13:21] <svnbot6> r15918 | kudra++ | Started reconstructing from Google

[13:21] <gaal> on feather, specifically, we can just kill pugs instances that get too old

[13:21] <gaal> (probably not a bad idea anyway)

[13:21] <agentzh> *nod*

[13:22] <gaal> in general fixing the smoke target to timeout.. well, that's an open task that's proved harder than it looked

[13:22] <gaal> because the execution of tests is ultimately handled by Test::Harness::Straps and we don't want to fork that

[13:22] <agentzh> that's the #1 obstacle.

[13:23] <agentzh> we surely don't want someone to watch that closely everyday.

[13:23] <gaal> well, like I said, on feather specifically we can have a hacky watchdog that runs ps |grep |kill or something...

[13:23] <agentzh> gaal: gotcha

[13:24] <agentzh> how long does "make smoke" usually take on feather?

[13:24] <agentzh> (normally)

[13:25] * agentzh guesses the answer is "it depends!"

[13:25] <gaal> I don't know: but the watchdog should limit pugs, not smoke.

[13:25] <agentzh> gaal: *nod*

[13:26] <gaal> if the build takes place under a dedicated user, then ps can easily be filtered

[13:26] * agentzh has never run "make smoke" himself because...

[13:26] <agentzh> gaal: that's right!

[13:27] <agentzh> i'll have a cut on this task tonight if i have enough time :)

[13:27] <agentzh> ssh is not terribly fast here :(

[13:28] <agentzh> gaal: thanks for the idea and solution.

[13:28] <agentzh> it looks practical to me.

[13:28] <gaal> "ps -o time,pid,args" will give cputime

[13:29] <agentzh> thanks for the tip.

[13:29] <agentzh> fortunately i'm currently on linux. :)

[13:29] <gaal> agentzh++

[13:29] <agentzh> gaal++

[13:34] <agentzh> i'll use my pugs tree instead of audreyt's so as to prevent potential conflicts with evalbot6.

[14:10] <moritz> did somebody add an xhtml header for the perldoc2xhtml output?

[14:11] <diakopter> moritz: no for now it's just copy/pasted in, based on what Pod::* does for the others

[14:12] <diakopter> there needs to be a Perl6::Spec module that uses Perl6::Perldoc and the other Pod::* modules, and does what smartlinks.pl does... imho.

[16:45] *** amnesiac joined
[16:47] <agentzh> diakopter: no. ;)

[16:47] <agentzh> i'm copying .svk directly.

[16:50] <gaal> welcome back lambdabot!

[16:51] <moritz> moose

[16:51] <agentzh> diakopter: thanks. i was apparently doing something stupid

[16:53] <agentzh> oh no...audreyt's .svk has been polluted also.

[16:53] <agentzh> anyone is having the same svk issue on feather?

[16:54] * agentzh has wasted a whole night on this trouble. :(

[16:55] <agentzh> gaal: sorry, can't even take the first step on feather. have to do the auto-smoke stuff another day :/

[16:57] <agentzh> G'night everyone &

[22:14] <riffraff> mh.. are placeholder vars supposed to work with for statement modifer?

[22:14] <riffraff> ?eval say($^a+$^b) for 1..2 X 1..2

[22:14] *** fridim_bot is now known as fridim

[22:14] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[4␤4␤] undef

[22:15] <moritz> riffraff: that's because (1, 2) in numeric context gives 2

[22:15] <moritz> = number of elements

[22:15] <riffraff> mh.. should have been @(foo X bar) ?

[22:16] <moritz> I don't think so

[22:16] <moritz> ?eval say $_[0]+$_[1] for 1..x X 1..2

[22:16] <evalbot_r15921> Error: No such subroutine: &x

[22:16] <moritz> ?eval say $_[0]+$_[1] for 1..2 X 1..2

[22:16] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[2␤3␤3␤4␤] undef

[22:17] <Jedai> ?eval say($^a + $^b) for (1..3) X (1..3)

[22:17] <moritz> is there a flatten() method or something

[22:18] <riffraff> ok, I understand moritz' output with $_ works as expected, still don't understand what happens with $^a + $^b

[22:18] <Jedai> Normally @() should work (I think) but in pugs it don't

[22:18] <moritz> riffraff: they will both contain a list

[22:18] <riffraff> yes, but which list?

[22:18] <moritz> you are iterating over a list of lists

[22:19] <riffraff> ah, twice at the time

[22:19] <Jedai> ?eval say($^a[0] + $^a[2]) for (1..3) X (1..3)

[22:19] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[1␤1␤1␤2␤2␤2␤3␤3␤3␤] undef

[22:19] <Jedai> ?eval say($^a[0] + $^a[1]) for (1..3) X (1..3)

[22:19] <moritz> ?eval say $^a.join(":"), " ", $^b.join("|") for 1..2 X 1..2

[22:19] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[1:1 1|2␤2:1 2|2␤] undef

[22:19] <riffraff> I thought they would unpack $_ and instead I'm getting two subsequent elements

[22:19] <moritz> riffraff: right

[22:20] <riffraff> yes, now I remember I've hit this before.. not sure I like it but I have to learn it :)

[22:20] <moritz> riffraff: at least it's consequent

[22:21] <moritz> ?eval for 1..2 X 1..2 -> my [$a, $b] -> { say $a+$b }

[22:21] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "my"␤expecting subroutine parameters, trait or block

[22:21] <moritz> ?eval for 1..2 X 1..2 -> [$a, $b] -> { say $a+$b }

[22:21] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "[$"␤expecting subroutine parameters, trait or block

[22:21] <Jedai> In Perl6 you should be able to do something like : for (1,2) X (1,2) -> [$a, $b], shouldn't you ?

[22:21] <moritz> ?eval for 1..2 X 1..2 -> ($a, $b) -> { say $a+$b } # that will not work

[22:21] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "->"␤expecting trait or block

[22:22] <moritz> ?eval for 1..2 X 1..2 -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b } # that will not work

[22:22] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[4␤4␤] undef

[22:22] <moritz> Jedai: no, because [...] is not an lvalue

[22:22] <moritz> ?eval for 1..2 X 1..2 -> [$a, $b]  { say $a+$b } # that will not work

[22:22] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "[$"␤expecting subroutine parameters, trait or block

[22:23] <Jedai> So you can't do that...

[22:23] <riffraff> I remember trying this things when solving one of the 99problems.. I ended up just using explicit references to $_[0] too

[22:23] <riffraff> but it's very nice to know that it was not just my ignorance :)

[22:24] <moritz> riffraff: maybe you can explicitly faltten the array before, but I wouldn't know how

[22:24] <Jedai> riffraff: Yeah I had one (the 90th one) like that to

[22:24] <Jedai> moritz: There's a response in the 7th 99problem I think

[22:24] <moritz> so are there still nice ones left?

[22:25] <riffraff> a flatten builtin would be quite useful, maybe an operator :)

[22:25] <Jedai> @() normally does that

[22:25] <lb> Maybe you meant: . bf ft id pl rc v wn

[22:25] <riffraff> moritz, I think there is a lot of space for alternative solutions 

[22:25] <moritz> that flatten uses $x.isa(Array)...

[22:25] <Jedai> my $flatten = -> $x { $x.isa(Array) ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x };

[22:26] <moritz> wouldn't "$x ~~ List" be more Perl6ish?

[22:26] <riffraff> Seq maybe?

[22:26] <avar> yep

[22:26] <Jedai> Yeah, that's because @@() and @() aren't really available in Pugs

[22:27] <moritz> http://nopaste.snit.ch:8001/9977

[22:27] <Jedai> Am I correct in believing @() will flatten anything ?

[22:27] <moritz> I get weird errors executing the problems

[22:28] <Jedai> ?eval my $flatten = -> $x { $x.isa(Array) ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x }; for $flatten(1..2 X 1..2) -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b }

[22:28] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "X"␤expecting operator, ":" or ")"

[22:29] <Jedai> ?eval my $flatten = -> $x { $x.isa(Array) ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x }; for $flatten.((1..2) X (1..2)) -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b }

[22:29] <evalbot_r15921> Error: ␤Unexpected "X"␤expecting operator, ":" or ")"

[22:30] <moritz> somehow my pugs tries to parse strict.pm from my perl 5.8

[22:30] <moritz> which means that the debian builds are broken :(

[22:30] <moritz> not again

[22:31] <Jedai> ?eval my $flatten = -> $x { $x.isa(Array) ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x }; for $flatten.([1..2 X 1..2]) -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b }

[22:31] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[2␤3␤3␤4␤] undef

[22:33] <moritz>  ?eval my $flatten = -> $x { $x ~~ List ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x }; for $flatten.([1..2 X 1..2]) -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b }

[22:33] <Jedai> So this flatten still works... (Which is rather good for me since one of my test use it)

[22:33] <moritz> ?eval my $flatten = -> $x { $x ~~ List ?? ( map $flatten, $x ) !! $x }; for $flatten.([1..2 X 1..2]) -> ($a, $b)  { say $a+$b }

[22:33] <evalbot_r15921> OUTPUT[2␤3␤3␤4␤] undef

[22:33] <Jedai> That's more Perlish :D

[22:36] <svnbot6> r15922 | moritz++ | problem07.t: substitutede .isa(Array) with ~~ List

[22:36] <moritz> does it still work? I can't test it right now :(

[22:36] <Jedai> Anyway we shouldn't have to use such a subroutine, it should be a builtin, and my guess was that @() would be it

[22:37] <Jedai> Can anybody confirm ?

[22:38] <moritz> that would make it a rather pointless problem ;-)

[22:39] <Jedai> moritz: I think that's the idea :) Most of the first problems are pointless in Perl6

[22:41] <moritz> hey, we could write a core module called Problems, and then 'use Problems 4.. 23'; p20(...); ;-)

[22:50] <avar> use Problems 99;

[23:11] <TimToady> @() only flattens List of Capture, so you'd still need a deep flattener sub

[23:17] <lb> Maybe you meant: . bf ft id pl rc v wn
