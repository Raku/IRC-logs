[02:24] <allbery_b> an apocalypse is a revelation.

[02:25] <allbery_b> the "usual" meaning is tied to Christian notions of the Second Coming, hence lovely things like a world-shattering war

[07:46] <agentzh> Salzh: hi

[07:46] <agentzh> Salzh == Sal Zhong ?

[07:50] <Alias_> Is YAML::Tiny good enough to handle the smoking data?

[07:50] <Alias_> :)

[07:52] *** iblechbot joined
[07:52] <agentzh> Alias_: YAML:Tiny is more light-weight than syck?

[07:54] <Alias_> Depends on what light-weightness you need

[07:54] <Alias_> It's about the same size in memory

[07:54] <agentzh> and the speed?

[07:54] <Alias_> It's a little slower, and can't support streams or braced mode structures and circular deps

[07:55] <Alias_> But it doesn't need a compiler

[07:55] <agentzh> k

[07:55] <Alias_> And it's easily embeddable

[07:55] <Alias_> TAP::Parser has it embedded already

[07:55] <Alias_> And of course, pure perl

[07:55] <agentzh> fair enough :)

[07:55] <Alias_> Of course, if you use streams or complex stuff (tags, directives, circulars) it's of no real use

[07:56] <Alias_> Basically, it's ideal for things like META.yaml

[07:56] *** mtve joined
[07:56] <Alias_> And other light-weight uses

[07:56] <agentzh> i'll try YAML::Tiny to parse my smoke.yml produced by pugs.

[07:56] <Alias_> In fact, not having to have CPAN depend on Syck or YAML.pm was my main driver

[07:56] <Alias_> If you have samples of smoke.yml I can include on in the YAML::Tiny test suite

[07:56] <agentzh> really?

[07:57] <Alias_> The tests ONLY consist of parsing of sample YAML fragments and comparing the results (optionally) with YAML.pm and YAML::Syck

[07:57] <agentzh> it's already an auto-updated one on the web.

[07:57] <Alias_> It does very little actual struct vs content tests

[07:57] <agentzh> Alias_: http://perlcabal.org/smoke.yml

[07:58] <agentzh> Alias_: it's produced by the feather daily auto-smoke using YAML::Syck

[07:58] <Alias_> ok

[07:58] * agentzh believes TINY is a good thing.

[07:58] <Alias_> hmm

[07:58] <Alias_> nope, not gunna work

[07:58] <agentzh> why?

[07:58] <Alias_> exclude_re: !!perl/scalar:Regexp ~

[07:58] <Alias_> Directives aren't supported

[07:58] <Alias_> And things like object embedding

[07:59] <agentzh> oh

[07:59] <Alias_> objects aren't supported either

[07:59] <agentzh> what do you mean by "directives" please?

[07:59] <Alias_> The !! stuff

[07:59] <Alias_> Maybe I'm using the wrong term there

[07:59] <agentzh> k

[08:00] <Alias_> Basically, it supports what you might call the "JSON" subset of structs

[08:00] <Alias_> comments, scalar, array, hash

[08:00] <agentzh> no circular data structures and no objects

[08:00] <Alias_> yup

[08:01] <agentzh> fair enough

[08:01] <agentzh> the pugs smoke mechanism blesses the data tree with appropriate class names.

[08:01] <Alias_> Other than the objects for the results and the regexp in there, it looks like it should be ok

[08:02] <Alias_> Large file though

[08:02] <agentzh> *nod*

[08:02] <Alias_> It's probably somewhat out of the scope of YAML::Tiny :)

[08:02] <agentzh> even syck takes quite a while to handle that on my new machine.

[08:03] <Alias_> But if you wanted to make the serialize/deserialize flatten those objects/regexp to struct equivalents, and then convert them back on deserialize, it would handle it

[08:03] <Alias_> I think

[08:03] <Alias_> I'd want to check those error messages work ok

[08:04] <agentzh> blessing is not that hard to handle, it seems.

[08:05] <offby1> gesundheit

[08:06] <avar> bless you

[08:09] * agentzh is testing the smoke-server

[08:12] <agentzh> cool, the smokeserver no longer reports weird smoke durations like "0.45 min"

[14:41] <Zaba> and about the executable?

[14:41] <agentzh> or something like that.

[14:42] <Zaba> oh

[14:42] <Zaba> is it pugs not perl6?

[14:42] <agentzh> pugs is a perl6 implementation.

[14:43] <Zaba> and does it affect the /usr/bin/perl symlink?

[14:43] <Zaba> agentzh, i know

[14:43] <Zaba> i thought the executable is perl6 not pugs

[14:43] <agentzh> the executable is pugs.

[14:43] <Zaba> (as perl5 is perl5.8.8 w/ symlink perl

[14:43] <Zaba> and does the symlink exist/being modified?

[14:44] <Zaba> pugs has native OO support right?

[14:44] <Zaba> does it require parrot?

[14:48] <agentzh> Zaba: we're currently working on it. pugs 6.28 will give you real OO support.

[14:48] <Zaba> oh

[14:48] <Zaba> nice

[14:48] <agentzh> currently a lot of OO features have already been implemented.

[14:49] <Zaba> nice

[14:49] <agentzh> but the MO stuff is not ready at this moment.

[14:49] <agentzh> MO == MetaObject

[14:49] <Zaba> agentzh, when will pugs be released?

[14:49] <agentzh> you mean 6.28?

[14:49] <Zaba> no, the release

[14:49] <agentzh> there are already many Pugs releases on CPAN.

[14:50] <Zaba> maybe .28 too

[14:50] <Zaba> agentzh, but it's alpha isn't it?

[14:50] <agentzh> true

[14:50] <Zaba> well

[14:52] <agentzh> why not contribute to perl 6 and make it happen *sooner*?

[14:52] <Zaba> because i don't know haskell

[14:52] <agentzh> Zaba: you can contribute to pugs by writing Perl 6 and Perl 5 code.

[14:52] <Zaba> orly?

[14:52] <Zaba> how?

[14:52] <agentzh> our test suite is written in pure Perl 6 :)

[14:52] <Zaba> aha

[14:53] <agentzh> and there're perl6-on-perl5 compilers in the pugs tree.

[14:53] <agentzh> it's another Perl 6 implementation which does *NOT* depend on pugs.

[14:53] <Zaba> o'rly??

[14:54] <Zaba> which?

[14:54] <agentzh> see v6.pm on CPAN :)

[14:54] <agentzh> http://search.cpan.org/~fglock/v6-alpha-0.016/lib/v6.pm

[14:54] <lambdabot> Title: v6 - An experimental Perl 6 implementation - search.cpan.org

[14:55] <Zaba> aha

[14:55] <agentzh> and there're perl6-on-perl6 compilers too.

[14:55] <agentzh> see v6/ in the pugs tree.

[14:55] <agentzh> they're mini-perl6 and kinda-perl6 compilers.

[14:55] <agentzh> these implementations are written in a subset of Perl 6 themselves.

[14:56] <Zaba> agentzh, i actually liked that perl5 had one official release

[14:56] <Zaba> here you don't know what to use, appears that there's both pugs and parrot :p

[14:57] <agentzh> in terms of completeness, pugs is the best of these efforts right now.

[14:57] <Zaba> i understand

[14:57] <agentzh> parallel efforts are good for finding the best way of doing things.

[14:57] <Zaba> still, there isn't 'official' perl6

[14:58] <agentzh> we believe they'll eventually converge some time in the future.

[14:59] <agentzh> larry has clarified in the spec that there won't be an official perl 6 implementation but there will be an official Perl 6 language.

[15:09] <agentzh> evalbot == pugs

[15:09] <Zaba> so what am i doing: eating supper

[15:09] <Zaba> nvm

[15:09] <Zaba> so what am i doing: an irc perl bot (not new)

[15:09] <Zaba> but i want it completely modular

[15:10] <Zaba> which is sane to do with OO

[15:10] <Zaba> and is hard to do w/o OO

[15:10] <agentzh> there're already many Perl 6 modules runnable by pugs

[15:10] <agentzh> see ext/

[15:11] <Zaba> IO::Socket is all i need in perl5 for communications

[15:12] <Zaba> but the problem is, perl5 has no pure OO

[15:12] <agentzh> Zaba: i think you should give Moose a shot.

[15:12] <agentzh> Moose provides really wonderful OO to perl 5.

[15:12] <Zaba> hm

[15:12] <veritos> Zaba: it's really easy to use. feels like perl6 with perl5 syntax.

[15:13] <Zaba> i thought of ruby for a while, and it just proved it sucks and my opinion of it is _right_

[15:13] <agentzh> and it's now production ready.

[15:14] <Zaba> hm

[15:15] <Zaba> (IRC bots in C++ are dumb, otherwise i'd make one already ._.)

[15:15] <agentzh> there is a irc bot in Perl 6.

[15:15] <agentzh> *an

[15:15] <Zaba> oh dude

[15:15] <Zaba> there are irc bots in perl5 too

[15:15] <Zaba> and i still write one :p

[15:15] <agentzh> that is evalbot6 you are talking to.

[15:16] <Zaba> the point is writing

[15:16] <Zaba> actually

[15:16] <Zaba> releasing it to the world it very rare

[15:17] <veritos> yep, hashkell supports bignums iirc

[17:21] <davidfetter> i really don't know enough about perl6

[17:21] <TimToady> none of us do.  :)

[17:22] <davidfetter> i'd want to talk with the fedora packagers about how best to introduce the underlying perl packages to fedora

[17:23] <TimToady> they're probably waiting for "real" Perl 6 before they think about it.

[17:23] *** VanilleBert joined
[17:23] <TimToady> and redhat currently has a bit of a python bias

[17:23] <davidfetter> they may be, or may not. i notice that a lot of perl modules with version < 1.0 are there, at least in -extras

[17:23] <[particle]> somehow deadrat and python just seem to go together....

[17:25] <TimToady> anyway, don't let me discourage you!  :)

[17:25] *** takanori joined
[17:26] <TimToady> after all, I use fc6...

[17:26] <TimToady> though I just get v6 directly from pugs/

[17:27] <TimToady> must admit I haven't played much with v6 lately, but that may change now that fglock is making v6 understand src/perl6/Perl-6.0.0-STD.pm

[17:29] <avar> davidfetter: <1.0 in perl modules generally doesn't mean the same thing as it does elsewhere

[18:01] <TimToady> diakopter: at this point I'm thinking much more about getting the frontend fully implemented than any particular backend.  If the frontend is there, the backends will follow along naturally, in sort of a mammalian locomotive way.

[18:03] <Yaakov> When your backend isn't following your frontend you have serious problems.

[18:04] <[particle]> luge.

[18:04] <Yaakov> If I was on a luge, I would have serious problems.

[18:05] <SamB> that reminds me of how GHC parses the syntax for associated type synonyms, but the typechecker chokes on it...

[18:05] <gnuvince> TimToady: Pugs doesn't yet run STD.pm, right?

[18:07] *** flyby5 joined

[18:16] <TimToady> pugs can parse the cheated version, but doesn't run it yet

[18:17] <[particle]> oh, i thought there were still parsing bugs... that's good news.

[18:22] *** oZ_ joined
[18:22] <TimToady> there are still parsing bugs--that's what the cheating is for

[18:28] <oZ_> Hey, guys. Forgive the n00b, but what exactly am I doing wrong when I do a make install of pugs and it pretty much nukes my core perl 5 modules with perl 6 versions?

[18:29] <wolverian> make install seems to be broken. none of us really use it.

[18:29] <integral> You may be the only person who uses 'make install'...

[18:29] <wolverian> (which is probably the reason why it is broken.)

[18:29] <integral> Someone should give you a commitbit to fix it :-)

[18:29] <oZ_> It's possible. ;)  It worked on the last make install I did on that box, which was about 3 months ago.

[18:30] <offby1> geez, it should be deleted if it doesn't work and isn't going to be fixed

[18:30] <offby1> otherwise it's an "attractive nuisance"

[18:30] <oZ_> I'm just happy I archived my library directory.

[18:30] <integral> Well, feel free to "fix" it by deleting it.

[18:30] <oZ_> Those of you who develop against pugs, do you make, symlink.. and then what with the lib directories?

[18:31] <integral> you just configure pugs to load from them, -I, use lib, etc

[18:31] <oZ_> That was my first inclination, just seeing if there were any other tricks. ;)

[23:29] <TimToady> this time feather is slow because two people are running ghc at the same time

[23:38] <TimToady> given the history of lvalue strings in p5, I think I can confidently predict that someone will figure out a way to break it accidentally.  :)

[23:38] <TimToady> but that says more about p5 than about you...

[23:38] <TimToady> rhr: doesn't take confidence, just foolhardiness

[23:38] <rhr> and I don't have a commit bit, you can send one to [email@hidden.address]
[23:41] <rhr> I assume they'd just be variants of open

[23:41] <TimToady> I will, but at the moment it looks like commitbit is down on svn.pugscode.org for some reason

[23:42] <TimToady> Yeah, they're just strange constructors, or factories, or something

[23:43] <TimToady> strange in that a single call is returning two new entangled objects

[23:43] <rhr> how's that?

[23:44] <TimToady> see man pipe(2), which returns two fds, one for reading, one for writing

[23:44] <rhr> oh, ok.  I was just thinking about the aut-fork case

[23:55] <[particle]> commitbit.pugscode.org isn't responding, seems

[23:57] <TimToady> strange, I can telnet svn.pugscode.org 9999 which is where I think commitbit redirects to

[23:57] <TimToady> but only from home, not from work

[23:58] <TimToady> loadavg is 13, so maybe it's just slow for you...

[23:58] <[particle]> svn.pugscode.org:9999 works

[23:58] <TimToady> dns wackiness maybe
