[02:20] <thoughtpolice> monaddo({my $a = 1},{ .say }) == 1

[02:21] <thoughtpolice> once my perl 6 monad implementation is done, i will be able to boast about it because apparently a lot of people don't like monads. :(

[02:23] <luqui> thoughtpolice, woah, interesting syntax

[02:23] *** weinigFood is now known as weinig

[02:23] <luqui> am I correct in assuming that you may say monaddo({ my $a = 1 }, { $a.say })

[02:23] <luqui> ?

[02:23] <thoughtpolice> no

[02:23] <thoughtpolice> just .say works

[02:23] <luqui> okay good

[02:24] <thoughtpolice> right now actually,

[02:24] <thoughtpolice> $a.say wouldn't work anyway

[02:24] <luqui> so how do you handle monadic binding

[02:24] <thoughtpolice> it's a very basic implementation

[02:24] <luqui> i.e. do { a <- something; b <- somethingelse; return (a + b) }

[02:24] <thoughtpolice> i'm working on trying to reduce from haskell monad's as directly as possible

[02:24] <thoughtpolice> answer: i'm working on it.

[02:25] <luqui> hm

[02:25] <luqui> okay.  you might find some solace using continuations, actually

[02:25] <thoughtpolice> perhaps.

[02:25] <luqui> did I just say that ? :-)

[02:25] <thoughtpolice> the monaddo I had above is more simple than you'd think

[02:25] <luqui> monads are very simple

[02:25] * jql inserts the "and now you have two problems" quote here

[02:26] <luqui> I once worked on a monad module for perl5

[02:26] <thoughtpolice> it's only like

[02:26] <thoughtpolice> four lines

[02:27] <thoughtpolice> sub monaddo(&b,*@a) { my $x = b(); $x = $_($x) for @a; }

[02:27] <thoughtpolice> so you might say there's a bit of work to be done :)

[02:27] <thoughtpolice> but hopefully I can come up with something workable

[02:28] <luqui> yeah, that's, um, the identity monad?

[02:28] <luqui> good luck anyway

[02:28] <luqui> I couldn't find a good way to do it in p5 without resorting to source filters

[02:28] <thoughtpolice> well it's for something i'm writing. my hope is basically to implement 'maybe' by one means or another;

[02:29] <luqui> maybe the function or maybe the monad?

[02:29] <thoughtpolice> monad

[02:29] <thoughtpolice> actually to be precise it's a monad I made up; Click

[02:29] <luqui> yeah, that's a useful one

[02:29] <luqui> make sure you get the list monad, too

[02:29] <luqui> I use that all the time; perhaps it is my favorite

[02:29] <thoughtpolice> but Click is the exact same as Maybe.

[02:29] <thoughtpolice> I only introduced it that way for simplicity

[02:30] <thoughtpolice> and gave a basic implementation of what it might look like/what happens in usage.

[02:30] <thoughtpolice> but Maybe is a good monad. it's probably the simplest monad that does something fairly usefeul

[02:30] <thoughtpolice> well except maybe list but :p

[02:30] <luqui> :-)

[02:31] <thoughtpolice> but granted variable binding is the main thing that's the issue.

[02:31] <thoughtpolice> especially for a direct reduction from haskell monads to a perl 6 monad lib.

[02:33] <thoughtpolice> interestingly this thing I'm writing (blog post) helped me with monads more as well; particularly their actual implementation and how to create your own.

[02:33] <thoughtpolice> so now I can implement my own to get cred :p

[02:34] <luqui> heh

[02:35] <thoughtpolice> but i don't quite know why a lot of people eschew them so horribly; they're really a pretty useful abstraction.

[02:35] <luqui> they just take a long time to get used to

[02:37] <thoughtpolice> i suppose.

[02:38] <thoughtpolice> imo the difficulty of groking them is somewhat worked up to a degree.

[02:39] <luqui> monads as containers is a nice tool

[02:39] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: explain monads in one sentence or less ;-)

[02:40] <luqui> or take paul graham's approach: explain monads using only one-syllable words

[02:40] <luqui> but I can't even ask the question doing that, so nevermind

[02:41] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: a monad is an abstraction that lets you create 'sequential' evaluation.

[02:41] <thoughtpolice> more specifically they let you do this in a way where you can make the rules with your own monads.

[02:43] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: and you wonder why people think of them as difficult.

[02:44] <thoughtpolice> i do; but I suppose in part that's due to the way they're explained generally.

[02:44] <PerlJam> perhaps

[02:44] <luqui> like being able to make the rules for sequential evaluation... ;-)

[02:44] <thoughtpolice> not enough code and a little to many words would be a good way to put it.

[02:45] <PerlJam> I think people have trouble with monads for the same reason people have trouble with recursion.  They aren't exposed to it early enough so it seems like something out of left field when it actually is introduced

[02:46] <luqui> and it's tough to think about if you haven't been exposed to it before

[02:46] <luqui> I was lucky enough to have fully groked closures when I was introduced to monads

[02:46] <PerlJam> If lisp or scheme is you first language, you may have a better grasp of monads than your average procedural programmer IMHO

[02:47] <PerlJam> not that they are related, just that your brain is better prepared.

[02:47] <thoughtpolice> if you ask me i think people need to be shown more example than more 'theory' (which is the approach many tutorials on monads take)

[02:47] <thoughtpolice> example: http://hpaste.org/171

[02:47] <Aankhen``> I'm learning Lisp and I understand closures well enough, but monads escape my comprehension. :-(

[02:48] <thoughtpolice> that's an implementation of a useful monad; providing you can understand what do-notation does and you know the bind operator, most of it should become clear

[02:48] <thoughtpolice> fairly immediately.

[02:48] <luqui> knowing the bind operator is the hardest part, but after seeing the output it should be clear what's going

[02:48] <luqui> on

[02:49] <luqui> what's the example you're using

[02:49] <luqui> I don't understand the clicked idea

[02:49] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: monads are just more abstract than you're used to :)

[02:49] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[02:49] <Aankhen``> Well, I'm reading Wikipedia to try understanding them once again.

[02:49] <thoughtpolice> the idea is just that your expressions either 'click' or they're 'silent'

[02:49] <Aankhen``> (What is this, the fifth time? :-P)

[02:49] <thoughtpolice> a quick look reveals,

[02:49] <thoughtpolice> that the Click monad is the exact same monad as Maybe

[02:50] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: but the words are all different ;)

[02:50] <thoughtpolice> :(

[02:50] *** damog left
[02:50] <luqui> thoughtpolice, yeah, I guess... it's not obvious to me though

[02:51] <thoughtpolice> luqui: well the example comes from the article i'm writing

[02:51] <luqui> I'd probably get it with more context

[02:51] <thoughtpolice> and it's for that article specifically; I explained it there

[02:51] <thoughtpolice> which would probably explain what the deal is.

[02:51] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: where's the article?

[02:51] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: I'm still working on it

[02:52] <PerlJam> so?  let us see!  :)

[02:52] <thoughtpolice> it's about applying the principles of functional programming to Perl 6. the monad's section I prefixed with 'somewhat tangential' since monads aren't necessarily directly related to functional programming, but they're an interesting enough topic to merit the extra writing.

[02:52] <Aankhen``> Nope, fifth time isn't the charm. *goes back to Lisp*

[02:54] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: actually if you gimme a moment I'll publish it; I can continue with the implementation of a monad like 'click' in perl 6 in a later interlude. plus blogger's 'compose' mode is really, really starting to aggrivate me to the point I don't want to have to fix my code every time I want to keep adding on

[02:54] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: don't worry about it. I know I haven't fully grokked monads either. Specific instances of a monad "click" :) for me, but the generality of it tends to elude my complete understand.

[02:54] <PerlJam> (i.e., I probably couldn't create a monad to save my life, but I can recognize and use them)

[02:54] <luqui> I can use any monad comfortably now, but I still have to pound my head against the wall a bit to write one

[02:55] <luqui> I was faced with the challenge of explaining monads to my roommate a few weeks back

[02:56] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: LOL. Okay, thanks for the encouragment!

[02:56] <luqui> I ended up going with that you're building a data structure that represents your code

[02:56] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: if your article doesn't already do so, could you provide a practical application for monads in perl 6 at some point?

[02:56] <luqui> list monad!

[02:56] <luqui> great for combinatorical stuff

[02:56] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: get together with mjd and you can write HOP6 or something ;)

[02:57] * Aankhen`` will apply partial evaluation to thoughtpolice's article in hopes of being able to at least understand them. ;-)

[02:58] <PerlJam> I wonder how many other people share the same mental block that luqui and I seem to have.

[02:58] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: the fundamental abstraction of a monad -is- the benefit

[02:59] <thoughtpolice> here's the post if anybody wants to take the time to read through it: http://diveintoperl6.blogspot.com/2007/05/interlude-functional-programming-with.html

[02:59] <lambdabot> Title: Dive into Perl 6: Interlude: Functional Programming with a side of Perl 6, http://tinyurl.com/22ldza

[02:59] <mncharity> luqui: I haven't backlogged, but note that I've always liked Arrows much more than Monads.  Superset.  And feel much less of a kludge.

[03:00] * luqui doesn't grok arrows yet

[03:00] <luqui> I've tried a few times

[03:00] <luqui> but I haven't seen any applications

[03:01] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: I think you've just highlighted "the" problem with monads.  People (myself included) are always looking for the concrete and monads are almost entirely about the abstract.

[03:01] <luqui> the list monad is what brought it together for me, really

[03:02] <luqui> that's when I started seeing more to them than there is to IO

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> i don't know; I've grown use to abstractions over time.

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> so I guess the real 'answer' to the monads dilemma

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> is YMMV

[03:02] <Aankhen``> ?eval <a b c d>.map(&say)

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> and personally,

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> the Writer monad is what 'clinched' the story for me

[03:02] <luqui> thoughtpolice, how long have you been using haskell?

[03:02] <Aankhen``> ENOEVALBOT

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> luqui: um, it's june,

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> so

[03:02] <thoughtpolice> I'd say it's roughly our 3.5 month anniversary or so.

[03:02] <luqui> our?

[03:03] <thoughtpolice> haskell :)

[03:03] <luqui> ah

[03:04] <Aankhen``> thoughtpolice: One note: You could not directly say 'hiordr(say,"asdf")' # s/say/&say/ and it works.

[03:04] <thoughtpolice> Aankhen``: ah. thanks. :)

[03:04] <luqui> thoughtpolice, used the reader monad?

[03:04] <Aankhen``> Wait, I'm about 13 revisions behind, so that might have changed.

[03:04] <thoughtpolice> luqui: a little bit.

[03:04] <Aankhen``> Er, more like 17.

[03:04] <thoughtpolice> actually I have an article I wrote over using the writer monad

[03:05] <thoughtpolice> after it really brought things together for me

[03:05] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[03:05] <luqui> haha

[03:06] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: well not the exact same, but their usage pretty much is.

[03:06] <thoughtpolice> Aankhen``: no, I tried it.

[03:06] <luqui> the algebra is the same

[03:06] <Aankhen``> AIUI, what you have will only push if the tester function returns true.

[03:06] <Aankhen``> Er, false.

[03:06] <thoughtpolice> for some reason it returned the inverse.

[03:06] <Aankhen``> Hmm, weird.

[03:06] <thoughtpolice> yeah i thought so too

[03:07] <PerlJam> no, your block is just wrong

[03:07] <PerlJam> $_ % 2 == 0 when they're even

[03:07] <PerlJam> (which is a false value)

[03:07] <thoughtpolice> btw if anybody is interested in that writer monad article: http://austin.youareinferior.net/?q=node/22. it's probably *not* the best intro to using monads in general, but it shows how to use writer and I explained it best I could.

[03:17] <thoughtpolice> btw PerlJam, I hope to get you back into haskell. that is in reality my deep, dark purpose.

[03:20] <PerlJam> thoughtpolice: I don't know if I'll have time for it much.  Back in the early days of pugs, I wrote a little code here and there (I think I fleshed out the first while loop or an unless conditional or something) but I haven't had the energy to keep at it.

[03:20] <luqui> I think that's a law of analogies:  a : b :: c : d <=> a : c :: b : d

[03:20] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: fun stuff.

[03:20] <luqui> though I've written some fairly OOish things in haskell with the help of ghc's existential types

[03:21] <luqui> it's not... natural though

[03:21] <luqui> but with a little syntax sugar it could be

[03:21] <TimToady> yes, I was thinking about the best way to present it...

[03:21] <PerlJam> But, I have to admit that of all the function languages I have encounted, Haskell is the most fun.  

[03:21] <thoughtpolice> PerlJam: most def.

[03:21] <PerlJam> s/function/functional/

[03:21] <thoughtpolice> speaking of OO, anybody ever tried O'Haskell?

[03:21] <luqui> perl 6 ain't bad, when you're talking to it's functional face

[03:22] <TimToady> perl 6 embraces both determinism and non-determinism :)

[03:24] *** ajs_home joined
[03:24] <TimToady> the main problem with monads is that they're too hard to lift...

[03:25] <PerlJam> TimToady: You've gotten punnier in your old age.  (or perhaps its just that I didn't know how punny you were in your younger days)

[03:26] <TimToady> maybe I'm just not as subtle anymore...

[03:26] <PerlJam> Could be that too.

[03:26] <luqui> I remember him commenting on a talk at my first YAPC

[03:26] <PerlJam> Or maybe you *are* subtle and I'm just perceptive ;)

[03:26] <thoughtpolice> the world may never know.

[03:26] <luqui> he punned after each sentence, uh, Allison? said

[03:27] *** Khisanth joined
[03:28] <luqui> I think his punniness has stayed approximately constant

[03:28] <PerlJam> Einstein had a constant once.

[03:29] <TimToady> cc!

[03:29] <TimToady> but I actually meant the "too hard to life" seriously

[03:29] <TimToady> *lift

[03:30] <TimToady> monads can be seen as strange objects that aren't allowed to ever enter the same state twice

[03:30] <TimToady> and in OO you can encapsulate such behavior, but

[03:30] <TimToady> as soon as two objects start talking to each other

[03:30] <TimToady> the indeterminacy sneaks back in unless you're careful.

[03:30] <TimToady> monads are about preventing that...

[03:31] <luqui> hmm, interesting take

[03:31] <TimToady> whether you want to or not...

[03:31] <TimToady> I'm an idiot savant--I meta-understand monads without understanding monads... :)

[03:33] <thoughtpolice> an award is needed. :)

[03:36] <thoughtpolice> TimToady: hopefully one day i'll get to the 'meta' level. if I ever get to meta-meta, I'll send you a postcard from wherever the hell I was when I figured that out.

[03:37] <luqui> hmmm, what's the converse of meta

[03:38] <thoughtpolice> unmeta in newspeak. :)

[03:38] <TimToady> I think it's usually called "can't see the forest for the trees" :)

[03:39] <TimToady> or maybe that's Never-Meta Land

[03:39] <TimToady> .oO(I never meta ... I didn't like)Oo.

[03:40] <luqui> sigh

[03:41] <TimToady> so monads enforce computational progress much like entropy does in the universe, except at the QM level, where things seem to be able to go back to the same state...

[03:41] <luqui> what's this?

[03:41] <luqui> all QM is reversible

[03:41] *** weinig_ joined
[03:41] <TimToady> agreed

[03:41] <luqui> so it can't go back into the same state...

[03:41] <TimToady> and objects can go back to the same state

[03:42] <TimToady> which it are you referring to that can't go back?

[03:42] <luqui> I don't know that much QM, but I know about the reversibility thing

[03:42] <luqui> and if you go back into the same state, you have a cycle

[03:43] <luqui> I don't know where I'm going with this

[03:43] <luqui> it'll hit me later tonight :-)

[03:43] <TimToady> it is my understanding that a quantum computer can only fluctuate randomly, you can't actually tell it to progress

[03:44] * luqui doesn't know enough to reach that type of understanding

[03:44] *** weinig joined
[03:44] <luqui> I'm at the "a quantum computer is like nothing I've imagined before" level

[03:45] <TimToady> yes, well, I'm sure my analogy will strain itself if I push it too much further.  :)

[03:46] <TimToady> but I have to talk about The Scripting Language Paradigm this weekend

[03:46] <thoughtpolice> pretty soon, things in the universe are going to loop around to the point where your 'quantum computer' will actually be a bread box.

[03:46] <PerlJam> TimToady: According to Geoffrey Moore you're an "Internet founding stalwart" and Tim O'Reilly seems to think that you can "see around corners".  So there's something to be said for stalwarts who can see around corners. :-)

[03:46] <thoughtpolice> and 1 will == dog

[03:46] <TimToady> and am thinking about Program as Text (where there's some tie to string theory there in pun form)

[03:47] <TimToady> and I'm the 100th most influential person in IT, which means I'm only famous for very nearly not being famous... :)

[03:48] <Alias_> heh

[03:48] <thoughtpolice> would you rate that as > or < not being famous entirely?

[03:48] <Alias_> Depends if you want fanboys

[03:48] <TimToady> being famous has helped me once.

[03:48] <TimToady> when YAPC was in Munich, and I didn't know where.

[03:49] <luqui> heh

[03:49] <PerlJam> someone recognized you and showed you the way?

[03:49] <TimToady> I said to Glo, let's just wander up and down the Marianplatz until someone

[03:49] <TimToady> recognized me.

[03:49] <Alias_> heh

[03:49] <TimToady> eventually someone did a double take

[03:49] <TimToady> and I said "Where are they?

[03:49] <TimToady> "

[03:50] <TimToady> only took 1.5 trips across

[03:51] <TimToady> I suppose it's also got me some number of speaking engagements, but those don't always feel like a net positive...

[03:53] <TimToady> so I have to tell people the history of scripting languages, past, present, and future, in 12-15 minutes on Sunday. :)

[03:54] <PerlJam> TimToady: merlyn has gottne a number of speaking engagements for being infamous.  You don't want to be famous like that  ;-)

[03:54] <TimToady> I guess I can comfort myself that there's no lack of material...

[03:54] <TimToady> but I do hate writing talks...

[03:56] <luqui> there are probably enough scripting languages just to do a poem listing all of them without context

[03:56] <thoughtpolice> most likely.

[03:56] * SubStack gets right on it.

[03:57] <luqui> I wish _I_ hated writing talks and were really good at it

[03:57] <luqui> I find myself in the opposite situation

[03:57] <Alias_> TimToady: I quite enjoyed my first 5 talks or so

[03:58] <Alias_> TimToady: I'm running out of material now though

[03:58] <Alias_> Other than "So here's what I did since last year"

[03:58] <TimToady> I have to talk about that too this summer, but not this weekend, fortunately

[03:59] *** rbruno joined
[04:00] *** rbruno left
[04:00] <obra> TimToady: the Scripting Languages talk is 15 minutes?

[04:00] <obra> That's crazy

[04:00] <TimToady> it's the final panel

[04:01] <TimToady> I'm sharing 1:20 with three other of the caliber of Bertrand Meyer

[04:01] <TimToady> and they want some time for open QA

[04:01] <TimToady> Q&A even :)

[04:01] <luqui> better make sure you have a test suite for your talk

[04:02] <obra> Not so bad.

[04:02] <TimToady> the other "Paradigms" are OO, FP, and high-performance/parallel

[04:02] <TimToady> it will be difficult not to go in and say "all your paradigms are belong to us"

[04:02] <luqui> what about both logic languages!?

[04:03] <Alias_> no logic ?

[04:03] <TimToady> dropped out

[04:03] <Alias_> Or Oz/Multi-paradigmic

[04:03] <TimToady> they only support 8 paradigms

[04:03] <TimToady> my goal is for Perl 6 to be lower on the wikipedia page than Oz. :)

[04:03] * Alias_ is trying to get into Oz a bit... and not getting very far

[04:04] <Alias_> I couldn't help but appreciate the linguistic detail in Perl

[04:04] <luqui> I found it hard to get into

[04:04] <luqui> mostly because of its obsession with emacs

[04:04] <Alias_> Because the stuff in Oz feels like a bad english translation of swedish

[04:04] <TimToady> it's always a mistake to think of a programming langage as embedded in an OS

[04:05] <Alias_> oh god, the emacs thing too

[04:05] <Alias_> I was sitting there ticking off the check boxes on the "Why your project fails Ashton's Law" list

[04:05] <TimToady> Oberon tried the OS thing too

[04:07] <Alias_> What's worse then forcing emacs, the TUTORIAL Hello World examples don't run outside emacs

[04:08] <Alias_> It took me until chapter 9 to cobble together something that would compile standalone

[04:09] <mncharity> Alias_:  you might find (disclaimer: my) http://www.vendian.org/oz/wiki/index.cgi?VirtualManual helpful

[04:09] <mncharity> though quite possibly bitrotted away at this point

[04:13] <Alias_> Well, anything would help at this point

[04:15] <thoughtpolice> i looked into Oz a little a long time ago

[04:16] <thoughtpolice> only thing I've heard about it recently is their goal to get Oz to compile to Erlang

[04:18] <Alias_> I encountered looking for a contraint solver that had a more readable/usable syntax than Prolog

[04:18] <TimToady> well, now if we can just get Perl 6 compiling down to Oz...

[04:18] *** deq` joined
[04:18] <Alias_> Because Prolog has something of a Lispy-aged feel to it

[04:18] <Alias_> I have a fairly classic dinner table problem I need solved

[04:18] <offby1> what wine to serve with fish?

[04:19] <Alias_> :)

[04:19] <thoughtpolice> Perl 6 -> A++ would be a nice one. :)

[04:19] <thoughtpolice> s:2nd/\+//

[04:19] <Alias_> TimToady: Any logic solving stuff in Perl 6 atm?

[04:20] <Alias_> I couldn't recall anything...

[04:20] <TimToady> it's just a SMAG

[04:20] <TimToady> SMOG rather

[04:20] <Alias_> G?

[04:20] <TimToady> Grammar

[04:20] <Alias_> ah

[04:20] <Alias_> If it comes in Perl 6.1 I wouldn't mind tbh

[04:27] <Aankhen``> perlbot: SMOG?

[04:27] <Aankhen``> Bah.

[04:28] <Aankhen``> o_O

[04:28] <Aankhen``> Interesting.

[04:32] <TimToady> a play on SMOP

[04:33] <TimToady> a Small Matter of Programming

[04:34] <Aankhen``> Ahh, heh.

[04:38] <Tene> Alias_: I can't find anything on google about ashton's law and programming.

[04:39] <Alias_> Ashton's Law is a recent one :)

[04:39] <Alias_> Named after Elaine Ashton

[04:39] <Alias_> "Just make it fucking easy to install"

[04:40] *** obvio171_ is now known as obvio171

[04:41] <Alias_> It explains why Oz takeup is low, but PHP is everywhere :)

[04:42] <Tene> perhaps we should exploit future IE vulnerabilities so that you can click a link in your browser and have Perl 6 installed on your windows system automagically.

[04:43] <Alias_> Wouldn't be hard

[04:43] <Alias_> Strawberry Perl is close to that easy to install

[04:44] <SubStack> It's easiest when it's already installed.

[04:44] <Alias_> true

[04:44] <Alias_> Dunno how easy it would be to get a bundling deal with Dell though

[04:45] <SubStack> already does through ubuntu and friends

[04:45] <[particle]> Alias_: last time i tried to compile parrot with strawberry perl it was not happy

[04:46] <Alias_> hrm

[04:46] <Alias_> [particle]: hrm... I'm not entirely surprised...

[04:46] <[particle]> i have a new dual xeon system to play with, and as soon as i get it running, i'll try again

[04:47] <Alias_> We've tweaked most of it just for our own context, it's not really setup as a general environment

[04:47] <[particle]> i'll be building parrot for vista x64

[04:47] <Alias_> But if it works, that would be interesting

[04:47] <[particle]> ah, i see

[04:47] <Alias_> Not heavily, we try to keep things relatively untouched

[04:47] <[particle]> yes, i'd like to get it working, but it's certainly not critical to parrot

[04:47] <Alias_> But there's a novel make setup

[04:48] <Alias_> And there's a few little games with libs

[04:48] <[particle]> have you built strawberry as 64bit?

[04:48] <Alias_> I've never built Strawberry full stop :)

[04:48] <Alias_> I just steer the ship, I avoid that side of it

[04:48] <[particle]> well then

[04:49] <Alias_> Perl::Dist::Strawberry though...

[04:49] <Alias_> All the code to build it yourself

[04:49] <Alias_> Making sure everything is replicatable is about as hands on as I get in that area

[04:49] <gaal> thoughtpolice: we lifted a few techniques from the oohaskell paper. see MO and Pugs.Class

[04:50] <Alias_> (since I'm not a C coder, I'm not the most appropriate person to be playing with compiling things anyways)

[04:50] <[particle]> okay, if i get back into it, i'll pollute the appropriate list/channel with my rants

[04:50] <Alias_> ok, thanks

[04:50] <Alias_> DAGOLDEN is who you want I think

[04:50] <Alias_> I mostly deal with CPAN toolchain stuff

[04:50] <[particle]> i've noticed :)

[04:50] <Alias_> some of the others in #win32 also know C though

[04:51] <[particle]> cpan: the 'a' is for alias

[04:51] <Alias_> hahaha :)

[04:51] <Alias_> Can I quote that :)

[04:51] <[particle]> go right ahead

[04:55] <[particle]> you might have to fight audrey for that letter, though

[04:56] <Alias_> :)

[04:56] <Alias_> nah

[04:56] <Alias_> I trump Audrey on that one

[04:56] <Alias_> The person I really need to worry about is Andreas :)

[04:57] <[particle]> heh, i suppose you're right :)

[04:57] <Alias_> hrm

[08:51] <thoughtpolice> hm. i need to find a good web framework. I want to code a new blog, with as little hassle as possible.

[08:51] <Aankhen``> Tried Catalyst yet? ;-)

[08:52] <thoughtpolice> no. it's on a todo list. primarily I want something simple.

[08:52] <thoughtpolice> camping looks nice for example.

[08:52] <Tene> thoughtpolice: also check out jifty

[08:52] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[08:54] <moritz> thoughtpolice: catalyst is not that hard

[08:55] <moritz> thoughtpolice: or you could try maypole (though I didn't undestand that very well)

[08:55] <thoughtpolice> as long as it's not PHP, it's considerable

[08:56] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[08:56] <thoughtpolice> i mean, I'd use a blogging system written in it; I just don't want to -write- it.

[08:56] <Aankhen``> Awww.

[08:56] <Aankhen``> MT or WordPress are probably your only options.

[08:56] <Aankhen``> Or, hey, you could try Vox.

[08:57] <Aankhen``> Though I don't know much about it other than a few people who use it.

[08:57] *** riffraff joined
[08:57] <thoughtpolice> well mainly I just want to write a small 'microblog' for myself. drupal is taking care of my site quite nicely; but drupal is kind of 'big' for just a simple blog, y'know?

[08:59] <thoughtpolice> which is why I was looking at camping

[09:00] <thoughtpolice> primarily some place where I can write stuff and put my code up; I mean, that's pretty much what I use my site for now anyway

[09:00] <thoughtpolice> if I don't find anything else I'll have to give camping a shot and see if I can get it on my site.

[09:01] <thoughtpolice> which is probably what will happen once I get my laziness up to actually write something in it.

[09:04] <lumi> thoughtpolice: camping?

[09:10] <lumi> Ah. The secret codeword is "ruby"

[09:11] <Tene> thoughtpolice: looked at blosxom?

[09:18] <thoughtpolice> i'll have to check it out

[09:19] <thoughtpolice> but it's simple so that's instant qualification for getting examined in my case.

[16:53] <moritz> I should mention that as a depency ;)

[16:54] <Qjimbo> well it works now

[16:57] <Qjimbo> nope

[16:57] <moritz> you should be!

[16:57] <Qjimbo> I don'T have it set up like that

[16:57] <Qjimbo> though I can move it there and set up a vhost I guess

[16:57] <moritz> so are you in ~/public_html/ or something?

[16:58] <Qjimbo> yeah

[16:58] <moritz> you probably need to make /home/ readable+executable to user 'www' or whatever apache runs as

[16:59] <Qjimbo> how would I do that?

[16:59] <moritz> the sledge hammer method would be "chmod a+rx /home/" as root

[16:59] <moritz> but tell nobody I proposed that ;)

[17:00] <Qjimbo> it works!

[17:00] <moritz> YaY

[17:01] <Qjimbo> thanks =D

[21:05] <TimToady> eventually, but @@ isn't implemented

[21:08] <moritz> I know :(

[21:10] <TimToady> at least the parens won't be necessary, since @@ is now a normal listop

[21:10] <TimToady> and Z binds tighter

[21:10] <TimToady> so @a.push: @@ ^10 Z ^10 should work

[21:10] <moritz> ok, thanks

[21:10] <TimToady> or perhaps more readably:

[21:10] <TimToady> so @a.push: slice ^10 Z ^10 should work

[21:11] <[particle]> so @@ looks like slices of a cinnamon roll, or sushi?

[21:12] <PerlJam> Z binds tighter?

[21:12] <TimToady> list prefix is looser than list infix for several months now

[21:12] <moritz> actually it just looks like swearing in comics ;)

[21:12] <PerlJam> It's weird for me to think of that in light of the precedences of &&/and  ||/or

[21:37] <polettix> is Z an abbreviation for zip?

[21:38] *** japhb joined
[21:38] <riffraff> it is an inifix operator for zip

[21:38] <riffraff> a Z b

[21:38] <polettix> ah I see

[21:40] <polettix> ¥ would have been better ;)

[21:41] <moritz> I would have liked ZIP

[21:42] <moritz> it's not that much to type, and pretty obvious what it does

[21:42] <polettix> I'm not particularly fond of the single Z letter as well

[21:42] <[particle]> Y? ;)

[21:43] <polettix> [particle]: why? :D

[21:47] <japhb> polettix: the Yen sign was used for a while, then was replaced

[21:48] <[particle]> since it was the only unicode operator

[21:48] <[particle]> iirc

[21:48] <japhb> French quotes still exist ...

[21:48] <polettix> it was cool anyway

[21:48] <[particle]> ah, maybe Z is just the ascii alternative

[21:48] <[particle]> haven't read that spec in a long time

[21:49] <polettix> japhb: but they can be replaced with << and >> IIRC

[22:14] <polettix> (or is it 12:17pm?)

[22:16] <TimToady> polettix: Z is a picture of the row-major visitation order

[22:16] <TimToady> and we thought Y would confuse functional programmers, who think it's the Y combinator...

[22:17] <TimToady> (it's also short for "zip")

[22:17] <TimToady> 0017 would be 12:17am

[22:17] <dduncan> and certainly an improvement in that regard

[22:17] <polettix> TimToady: this is all correct, just thinking it would be cool

[22:18] <polettix> TimToady: anyway, I don't particularly like using a single letter as an operator

[22:18] <moritz> what about a haskell'ish `$func` syntax for infixing $func?

[22:18] <moritz> we don't have to use backticks though

[22:18] <polettix> TimToady: but it probably boils down to getting used to it (or getting not to use it :)

[22:19] <moritz> but [`zip`] would look weird

[22:19] <TimToady> `foo` wouldn't tell you what precedence it should be

[22:30] <sparvu> hey all

[22:31] <sparvu> anyone any ideas about pugs on Solaris 10 x86 or SPARC ?

[22:31] <sparvu> I have got the ghc package for Solaris x86 but get problems when configuring pugs

[22:31] <[particle]> check smoke.pugscode.org for reports

[22:32] <moritz> sparvu: "problems" is not very specific ;)

[22:32] <sparvu> moritz: yeah, true. a sec to pastebin the results

[22:34] <sparvu> pastebin.com seems not worink. Basically I have ghc in place, perl 5.8.8 in place

[22:35] <sparvu> Im trying to ./configure Pugs after I svn co the pugs source code

[22:35] <sparvu> and get these:

[22:35] <sparvu> d: fatal: symbol `s44W_info' in file /export/home/sparvu/ghc/lib/ghc-6.6.1/libHSCabal.a(Utils__90.o): section [1] .text: size 1042: symbol (address 0x400, size 20) lies outside of containing section

[22:36] <thoughtpolice> you've run the makefile.pl right?

[22:36] <polettix> is it wrong that I never did ./configure but used perl Makefile.PL?

[22:36] <sparvu> hmmm, I think I did a: configure Pugs from start

[22:36] <thoughtpolice> try perl Makefile.PL

[22:36] <thoughtpolice> then run a make

[22:36] <sparvu> do I need to clean first ?

[22:37] <thoughtpolice> i would go ahead and do so

[22:37] <moritz> eh, ./configure just calls perl Makefile.PL ;-)

[22:37] <sparvu> same thing when I ran: perl Makefile.PL

[22:37] <Tene> Hmm.  Pugs is currently segfaulting for me.

[22:38] * Tene reqbuilds everything from scratch.

[22:38] <sparvu> Just curious: could be something to dow with ghc and static libraries ?

[22:39] <sparvu> that I have no clue. Well at the moment Im trying to get pugs on Solaris 10 working

[22:39] <sparvu> I will keep you posted about results

[22:39] <moritz> sparvu: perhaps you could google for Cabal+Solaris issues

[22:40] <sparvu> moritz: thx, I will do that

[22:40] <moritz> just a guess though

[22:40] <thoughtpolice> just from the err above it pretty much means that the Cabal static lib has a symbol outside of .text where it should be.

[22:41] <thoughtpolice> how the hell that would happen, I'm not totally sure. especially if you built 6.6.1.

[22:41] <sparvu> Solaris ld != GNU ld. Could this be a problem ?

[22:41] <thoughtpolice> might be.

[22:41] <sparvu> thx, I will think about it.

[22:42] <thoughtpolice> get some gnu tools and configure pugs to build with them rather than your default tools; it could solve your problem

[22:42] <sparvu> yeah, I could try that

[22:45] <thoughtpolice> has anybody taken the liberty to put haddock documentation of pugs up? I've noticed haddock-esque comments throughout the source.
