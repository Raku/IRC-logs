[13:32] <Aankhen``> That has a good description.

[15:50] <fglock> "kp6 --perl5rx" compiles Grammar.pm 5 times faster than kp6 with the portable regex-engine

[15:51] <moritz_> fglock: and is the output correct?

[15:52] <fglock> I don't know, but fixing it should not make it slower

[15:53] <pmurias> is the resulting code faster?

[15:53] <fglock> I didn't try to run it yet

[15:55] <fglock> pmurias: do you know how to modify the Makefile to compile to "compiled/perl5/lib" instead of "lib-modules-kp6-mp6-p5" ?

[15:55] <fglock> I'm making some directory cleanup

[15:58] <pmurias> fglock: looking

[15:59] <fglock> btw, "kp6 --perl5rx" compiles Grammar.pm more than twice as fast than MiniPerl6

[16:00] <fglock> mostly because MiniPerl6 uses the portable regex engine, which requires a recursive compilation step

[16:34] <pmurias> fglock: quasi-quoting is equivalent to using ::AstNode(...) while keeping p6 syntax

[16:34] <pmurias> so it's a replacement for generating perl6 as strings

[16:35] <fglock> pmurias: got it :)

[16:36] <fglock> avar: re kp6-kp6 no, it's been broken for some time

[16:38] <avar> so we're aiming for bringing kp6 up to full p6?

[16:38] <pmurias> avar: yes

[16:38] <avar> excellent:)

[16:39] <TimToady> quasi-quoting is basically what keeps hygienic macros hygienic.

[16:39] <TimToady> otherwise you've just got scoped source filtering

[16:40] <TimToady> which is admittedly an improvement over p5

[16:50] <fglock> is it possible to separate kp6-kp6 from kp6-mp6 in the Makefile? every time I run "make test" it tries to build kp6-kp6

[16:51] <fglock> could probably use an ENV 

[16:52] *** franck____ left
[16:53] <fglock> set KP6_TARGET="KP6-KP6" ; perl Makefile.PL

[16:55] <fglock> then make and make test would do the right thing

[19:49] <pmurias> Aankh|Clone: what sort of macro examples do you consider non trival?

[19:51] <Aankh|Clone> I'm not sure.

[19:51] <Aankh|Clone> Something that shows a common (though not common enough to be a core construct, of course) use for a macro, I suppose‚Ä¶

[19:52] <Aankh|Clone> Though honestly, I've never seen a proper Perl 6 macro except in the specs, so anything would probably do‚Ä¶

[19:52] <pmurias> Aankh|Clone: the harders part is finding a non-core construct ;)

[19:52] <pmurias> * hardest

[19:52] <Aankh|Clone> Hehe.

[19:54] <pmurias> something like macro circumfix:<'( )> is parsed(/<sexpr>/) {...} comes to mind
