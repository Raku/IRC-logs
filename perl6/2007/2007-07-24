[08:33] <diakopter> um, that was interesting.  pugs 'make soon' compiled in 3 minutes, immediately following a (successful) 'make realclean'.

[08:37] <masak> that's soon.

[08:40] <diakopter> I seem to recall it taking about 10x longer than that, previously.  perhaps I'm mistaken, though.

[08:41] <masak> if nothing seems to be amiss, 3 minutes is good news, no?

[08:49] <masak> diakopter++ # haskell comment hacker

[08:51] <diakopter> Haskell.tmbundle (TextMate) is nifty... (I must always have the very best golf clubs before I fix typos in comments.)

[08:54] *** charsbar joined
[08:58] * masak goes to look up TextMate

[08:58] <Patterner> TextMate is good.

[08:58] <masak> this Mac culture thingie is disorienting for me as a long-time Linux user

[08:58] <masak> suddenly I have to pay for some things

[08:58] <masak> I'm not used to paying for software

[08:59] <Aankh|Clone> diakopter: ROTFLMAO.

[09:00] <masak> I know that FOSS != free as in beer, but still that is the immediate and most noticeable effect for me

[09:00] *** idiotmax left
[09:03] <diakopter> you don't pay to *use* !freeware.. you pay to be slightly-safer(or so they want you to think)-from-(groundless?-)prosecution-than-if-you-used-a-warez/serialz/crackd/keygen version of the !freeware. That said, I'll likely pay for a TextMate when the trial runs out.  But probably not appleDarwin10.5.

[09:04] <diakopter> a TextMate license <sigh>

[09:05] <masak> diakopter: for me it's not the consequences of using a warez version that limits me, it's the morality of it

[09:05] <masak> for some reason, I prefer to use software under the conditions that their author(s) have set up for it

[09:05] <masak> that said, I mostly use FOSSware

[09:07] <diakopter> masak: I didn't say I would *use* appleDarwin10.5... (or TextMate after the trial runs out). It's just that in some cases, the true 'author(s)' are hard to pin down.

[09:09] <masak> diakopter: why are they hard to pin down? I imagine that those who accept money should be pretty easy to reach

[09:09] *** unobe is now known as unobe_away

[09:15] *** chris2 joined
[09:18] <diakopter> masak: 'pin down', meaning 'identify'.

[09:21] <masak> diakopter: ok. when would it matter that they are hard to identify?

[09:27] <diakopter> I mean to say that in some cases (okay, fewer than I was implying), a bit of copy-protected software isn't worth the license fee b/c it's composed of a ton of FOSS, with a tiny bit of functionality added on (and perhaps a trademark on the rebrand/rename), and so, is in my opinion, not worth reimplementing myself (if even I could), but also not worth paying the license fee.  In those cases, I would rather send some money to the ...

[09:27] <diakopter> ... makers of the FOSS libraries that enabled the person to wrap/bundle/copy-protect it.

[09:28] <masak> diakopter: ah

[09:29] <masak> diakopter: also, sometimes, as is the case with e.g. Menufela, the fee is basically for the packaging of a registry setting somewhere

[09:30] <masak> nevertheless, I'm seriously contemplating paying the $5 it costs, because I liked those settings

[09:30] <masak> but still it's a strange new world for one who is used to the idea of free (as in beer) knowledge

[09:31] <diakopter> If I can honestly say that I would feel guilty demanding a license fee >USD$x for this bit of copy-protected software (if I were the copy-protector), then I'm going to have a harder time feeling good/willing about paying for it.

[09:32] <masak> that's some kind of reverse golden rule logic :)

[09:36] <diakopter> I mean, if (say) the author found out about my (theoretical) copy-protection-avoidance via a kernel extension that bypassed Little Snitch and sent a packet somewhere or (even more cruelly and effectively impossible to detect) used public DNS lookups to send himself information from my computer, but still took the time to send me an email and (somewhat successfully) try to convince me that he deserves the license fee for his ...

[09:37] <diakopter> ... efforts, I'd seriously consider paying the fee, just b/c the person was willing and able to persuade me the software is worth it.  But then I'd probably turn around and blog about the surreptitious information delivery.

[09:39] <diakopter> I don't know of any tools that help a firewall blacklist authoritative DNS servers.... and still that would be helpful only for those who don't use any intermediary recursively resolving DNS servers (but instead use only their own).

[09:40] * Alias_ has kind of always wanted to release something people liked enough to pay

[09:40] <Alias_> But I never get around to doing anything sufficiently end-usery

[09:40] <Alias_> Most of my stuff is toolchain and support modules

[09:42] <diakopter> Alias_: I daresay if you put up a donate link somewhere, you'd get donations.  I say that without knowing whether you already have a donate link..... :)

[09:42] <Alias_> I don't

[09:42] <masak> hm. the freeware concept of paying for a proper/complete version, never appealed to me

[09:42] <masak> Alias_: I agree with diakopter. put up a donate link

[09:42] <Alias_> hmm

[09:43] <Alias_> Trouble is that from what I can tell, nobody donates to small stuff

[09:43] <Alias_> I looked at the sourceforge donation stuff once, and hardly anyone ever did

[09:43] <Alias_> Except to the really popular end-user stuff

[09:46] <masak> Alias_: but you do good blogging as well. I enjoy reading your blog posts sometimes. my guess is that those give you an image and an increased target for donation than the small sourceforge projects

[09:46] <Alias_> maybe

[09:46] <diakopter> Alias_: well as long as your reputation is even somewhat close to the "Starving Artist" image as opposed to the patent/trademark-exploiting trivialware... you'd do okay. :)

[09:47] <Alias_> heh

[09:47] <Alias_> The image of a Starving Artist is something I would like to avoid though

[09:47] <Alias_> So the question is, how to do it tactfully while retaining my dignity :)

[09:47] <Alias_> masak: Glad you like the posts btw

[09:47] <Alias_> Please don't call it a blog though :)

[09:48] <Alias_> Makes me cringe :)

[09:48] *** torz joined
[09:48] <masak> Alias_: ok -- journal?

[09:48] <Alias_> yup

[09:48] <masak> the difference is slightly blurred for me

[09:48] <masak> though I agree that 'blog' is a silly word

[09:48] <Alias_> Well, I see a blog as a sort of stream of conciousness thing

[09:48] <masak> heh

[09:48] <Alias_> "What I saw on this website today"

[09:48] <Alias_> etc

[09:48] <masak> I see

[09:48] <Alias_> Some are themed, some are personal etc

[09:49] <Alias_> I see use.perl as a development journal

[09:49] <masak> yes

[09:49] <diakopter> how about The Seasoned Professional Who Deserves And Earns A Reasonable Profit, And Gives Back To The Community From His Produce?

[09:49] <Alias_> A place to note the Perl stuff I'm working on, or prototype talks/thoughts

[09:49] <Alias_> Mostly so I don't have to say the same things over and over and can just point to URLs

[09:49] <Alias_> :)

[09:50] <Alias_> Which is why I started it in the first place

[09:50] <Alias_> I got sick of explaining document/code duality

[09:51] <masak> Alias_: re avoiding the Starving Artist image: just don't be unnatural about the donation stuff. make it blend in -- not disappear, but not scream out in any way either

[09:51] <Alias_> ya

[09:51] <masak> maybe Wikipedia is a good role model

[09:51] <masak> their donation notices don't disturb me at all

[09:51] <Alias_> wikipedia is also one of those things that's heavily used and mostly by end-users

[09:51] <Alias_> I'll think of something

[09:51] <masak> Wikipedia is the only thing I've ever donated to, btw

[09:52] <diakopter> Alias_: developers are end-users, too.

[09:52] <Alias_> really?

[09:52] <Alias_> (masak)

[09:52] <masak> yes. so they did something right :)

[09:52] <masak> maybe I should say the only computer-related thing

[09:53] <Alias_> ya

[09:53] <diakopter> Alias_: I mean: they're the end-users of your products. And I'm sure many of them consider themselves such.

[09:53] <Alias_> I suppose I could start the "Strategic Drama Bomb Reward" fund

[09:53] <masak> :)

[09:54] <masak> that's a great name! where can I donate?

[09:54] <Alias_> ala Vertical Metre of Beer fund :)

[09:54] <Alias_> In fact...

[09:55] <masak> care to explain the name, btw?

[09:56] <Alias_> It comes from the original creation of Vanilla Perl

[09:56] *** wolv joined
[09:56] *** wolv left
[09:56] <Alias_> Two years ago this month, at OSCON, I did my PPI talk, but I couldn't do the live PPI::Tester demo, because ActivePerl doesn't have a working CPAN client

[09:57] <masak> it doesn't?

[09:57] <Alias_> nope

[09:57] <masak> uncool

[09:57] <Alias_> They have binary packages

[09:57] <masak> eech

[09:57] <Alias_> unfortunately, their binary package build system is also screwed

[09:57] <Alias_> Fatally

[09:57] <Alias_> I had spent almost 9 months trying to get them to fix it and help them out

[09:57] <masak> :(

[09:57] <Alias_> In the end, 3 months after OSCON, we hit a dead end

[09:57] <masak> why?

[09:58] <Alias_> They couldn't fix the problem, for business/legal reasons

[09:58] * masak sighs

[09:58] <Alias_> They had guarenteed binary backcompatibility to 5.8.0 for all their binary packages

[09:58] <Alias_> Which cause the build system to get confused about and break Scalar::Util

[09:58] <Alias_> AND EVERYTHING THAT DEPENDS ON IT

[09:58] <szbalint> oh my

[09:58] <Alias_> Recursively

[09:58] <masak> ...I seem to remember scraps of this

[09:58] <Alias_> ya

[09:58] <szbalint> nice hole they dug themselves into

[09:58] <masak> you've probably journalled about it

[09:59] <Alias_> A few times

[09:59] <masak> :)

[09:59] <Alias_> I also asked if they could just bundle dmake and mingw gcc with ActivePerl

[09:59] <Alias_> Which would give us a working CPAN client and make the point moot

[09:59] <Alias_> And that ended with a DIFFERENT legal dead end

[09:59] <Alias_> Because ActivePerl contains some minor amounts of code that is released under the ActivePerl license

[09:59] <Alias_> And the ActivePerl license is incompatible with the GPL

[10:00] <Alias_> *head*desk*

[10:00] <masak> :(

[10:00] <Alias_> So at that point, I decided ActivePerl was non-recoverable, and we should just make a new Win32 distro

[10:00] <Alias_> I mean, how hard could it be right

[10:00] <masak> :)

[10:00] <Alias_> By that point, I'd figured out through all this that the binary PPM system ActivePerl used was no longer necesary

[10:01] <Alias_> Because of dmake (nmake replacement) and gcc(mingw) working natively on Win32

[10:01] <Alias_> So theoretically you could make a complete working Perl

[10:01] <Alias_> But of course I don't know C

[10:01] <Alias_> So I spent 2-3 months trying to get people that did know C and make and such to help make me a simple Win32 installer

[10:01] <Alias_> And it went nowhere, people would offer to help, and then do nothing

[10:02] <Alias_> The curse of the volunteer project, of course

[10:02] <masak> yes

[10:02] <Alias_> So I decided I needed to take a new approach

[10:02] <masak> money

[10:02] <Alias_> kinda

[10:02] <szbalint> yeah it's kind of a "scratch an itch" thing with a lot of volunteer projects

[10:02] <Alias_> So I made a public offer, a reward.

[10:03] *** Aankh|Clone left
[10:03] <Alias_> That I would give whoever brought me a working Win32 Perl installer, meeting certain criteria but not specifying how it should be created, a vertical metre of beer

[10:03] <Alias_> That is, they pick a beer, and we buy crates of it and stack them up until it was a metre high

[10:04] <Alias_> And I pay

[10:04] <Alias_> Any beer they wanted

[10:04] <Alias_> (excepting of course stupidly overpriced $10 a bottle ones) :)

[10:04] <masak> that's a great reward

[10:04] <Alias_> indeed

[10:04] <masak> I wish there were more such rewards

[10:05] <Alias_> I posted it in my journal

[10:05] <masak> I remember

[10:05] <Alias_> And it got, I'm told, copied around to a ton of monger lists

[10:05] <Alias_> And I had a working installer in two days

[10:05] <Alias_> :)

[10:05] *** BinGOs_ joined
[10:05] <masak> *lol*

[10:05] <szbalint> lol

[10:05] <Alias_> Two in fact, using two entirely different approaches

[10:05] <Alias_> One beat the other by like an hour

[10:06] <Alias_> So it wasn't the money

[10:06] <Alias_> It was the sheer insanity and attention-grabbing nature of the reward, and the social reward of winning it

[10:06] <diakopter> it was the novelty of the reward, and the story they could tell about it.

[10:06] <Alias_> indeed

[10:06] <szbalint> nicely done anyway

[10:06] <Alias_> The guy that won it was from the same city as me

[10:06] <diakopter> what you said

[10:06] <szbalint> is the solution still in use?

[10:06] <Alias_> In fact, the head of my monger group

[10:07] <Alias_> The winning one isn't

[10:07] <Alias_> He wrote a macro-installer

[10:07] <Alias_> It was 500k

[10:07] <Juerd> I always thought vertical meters were bottles, not crates, and was underwhelmed by such contests :)

[10:07] <Juerd> And I did wonder how to stack bottles like that.

[10:07] <masak> Alias_: what did the beer cost you in the end, if you don't mind me asking?

[10:07] <Alias_> About AU $180

[10:08] <Alias_> The installer started up, then went to the ActivePerl website, and downloaded ActivePerl, then downloaded dmake, and some C++ editor that just happened to have a working gcc in it

[10:08] <Alias_> And the macro-installer installed all three, and automated the configuration to make them work together

[10:08] <masak> Alias_: also, you haven't explained the "drama bomb reward" name

[10:08] <Alias_> oh... "drama bomb" is an EVE Online term

[10:09] <Alias_> For intentionally, generally with no warning, announcing something rediculously attention grabbing

[10:09] <Alias_> And real

[10:09] <szbalint> heh.

[10:09] <Alias_> (of course)

[10:09] <szbalint> This was the last channel I expected someone to talk about eve online

[10:09] <szbalint> :)

[10:09] <Alias_> Imagine audreyt turning up and announcing she was releasing an official Perl 6 beta today

[10:09] <Alias_> That's a drama bomb :)

[10:09] <Alias_> szbalint, you play?

[10:10] *** BinGOs left
[10:10] <szbalint> indeed

[10:10] * Alias_ refers szbalint to irc.perl.org #eve

[10:11] <szbalint> ty

[10:11] <Alias_> Anyways

[10:11] <Alias_> The metre of beer reward also drove kane to defeat Acme::BadExample

[10:11] <Alias_> Which was what inspired using the same thing for good, instead of evil

[10:13] <szbalint> btw how can I connect to irc.perl.org? The dns doesn't seem to be working

[14:24] <masak> :(

[14:25] <meppl> masak, some austrian people say "gugu" to little childs. its slang. it comes from the verb "kucken"(to watch) as command "kuck!"(watch!) --> "kuck kuck" --> "gugu"

[14:26] <meppl> masak, so, the mother says "guguu" to the baby and the child looks on its mother

[14:26] <meppl> its a greeting

[15:36] <diakopter> I see someone already said that

[15:37] <diakopter> Zoffix: would you like a commit bit for pugs (so you can fix that href typo)?  otherwise I or anyone else can fix it...

[15:47] <BinGOs> I was being wonderously humourous.

[15:47] <diakopter> hm.  huggies is a diaper ("nappy"?) brand

[15:47] <BinGOs> erm

[15:47] <diakopter> sorry; huggles you said

[15:47] <BinGOs> 'huggles' is a cuter form of hugs.

[15:48] <BinGOs> anyways....

[15:48] <diakopter> i see, haskell users' golfing system

[15:48] <BinGOs> I am in your pugs, smoking.

[15:57] <masak> just wanted to note, to anyone who has the knowhow to fix it, that http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/apo/A07.html gives a 404 right now. I know it isn't very long, but it's being referenced from http://perlcabal.org/syn/ so it'd be nicer if it was present

[15:57] <masak> s/was/were/ # conditional is hard for us foreigners

[15:59] <diakopter> masak: :D it's been 404 for at least a year. I think I mentioned it to someone back then and someone said it didn't matter...

[16:00] <masak> diakopter: 404s always matter

[16:00] <masak> unless they are intentional, which they very seldom are

[16:00] <masak> and that just makes them matter but in a different way

[16:01] <masak> I think it matters because the AES are the most official in the way of docs that perl6 has

[16:02] <masak> and a 404 in the midst of official docs is a big deal

[17:23] <Alias_> I've never heard of either

[17:23] <Alias_> tbh

[17:23] <diakopter> neither had I until I started researching make replacments

[18:17] <diakopter> yesterday I asked Dr. GHC about that unified event/threading/concurrency model/implementation by Peng Li (honorary Perl 6 S17), and he said that Peng Li was working on reducing his implementation's performance hit with the goal of integrating it into GHC proper eventually (several months to a year perhaps).

[18:19] <[particle]> it'd be nice to track the progress of that project more closely. any idea if that's possible?

[18:20] <diakopter> I dunno. :) I suppose we could ask Peng Li if he wants to use the pugs subversion repo for scm. :)

[18:20] <[particle]> that's certainly one way :)

[18:22] <diakopter> does anyone know how to tell ghc/cabal to 'make install' HsSyck and hsregex?

[18:22] <diakopter> (so that they don't have to be rebuilt after a 'make (real)clean')

[18:23] <diakopter> although I suppose another make target could be forked for that purpose.

[18:40] <Aankhen``> I have to admit, I don't understand how to apply the unified concurrency model to languages other than Haskell.

[18:41] * diakopter muses MJD's HOP::Parser combined with Template::Declare's magic could be used to write Grammars....

[18:42] <diakopter> Aankhen``: for (theoretical) use in pugs... in case such optimization possibilities end up being helpful in bootstrapping.

[18:42] <Aankhen``> diakopter: Eh wha?

[18:43] *** weinig is now known as weinig|bbl

[18:44] <diakopter> Aankhen``: I'm sure I don't know what I'm talking about, but I was imagining that tool being used by pugs... but that the api/model itself is portable to Perl 6.

[18:44] <diakopter> TimToady: help? :)

[18:45] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[18:45] <Aankhen``> I know Perl 6 will use the same model, I just don't understand how it works.

[18:45] <Aankhen``> I'm probably in over my head.

[18:47] <diakopter> Aankhen``: join the club...

[18:47] <diakopter> (as they say)

[18:47] <Aankhen``> Hehe.

[18:48] <diakopter> what's (of course) up in the air is how it would work on non-Linux or Linux<2.4.

[18:48] <diakopter> (if at all)

[18:48] <Aankhen``> Yeh.

[18:49] <Aankhen``> I like the combined actors + events + threads model, personally. :-)
