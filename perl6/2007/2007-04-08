[00:02] <Limbic_Region> heh, just the other day I wrote some code for someone in #perl and they complained it didn't work - use warnings; was throwing an error # guess how old the perl he had to use was

[00:03] <dmq> er.

[00:03] <dmq> 5.005

[00:03] <moritz> that's beyond my scope ;-)

[00:03] <Limbic_Region> I think it was 5.003 or 5.004

[00:03] <Limbic_Region> but no later than that

[13:47] <moritz> agentzh: ok

[15:12] <[particle]> once pugs does process it, then this file can be shared between implementations freely

[15:12] <[particle]> pugs tests must be converted over to this style of todo so parrot can share them, too

[17:28] <agentzh> ah, datefudge is a UNIX tool, it seems :)

[17:33] <agentzh> right

[17:34] <agentzh> or i just should mock that call.

[17:34] <agentzh> what i really want to do is comparing HTML diffs.

[17:34] <agentzh> the changing dates make diff'ing much more difficult.

[17:34] <moritz> comparing diffs? second derivatives?

[17:35] <agentzh> moritz: i mean text diff.

[17:35] <gaal> is it? you could just preprocess them and elide the dates.

[17:35] <agentzh> gaal: *nod*

[17:36] <gaal> alternatively, since smartlinks already has a main() if ! caller, use a preloaded mocker that replaces gmtime...

[17:36] <agentzh> gaal: sounds like a good idea :)

[17:37] <gaal> sub gmtime { 1..6 } do 'util/smartlinks.pl'; main()

[18:16] <agentzh> feedback on the passing rate of util/t/smartlinks2.t on your platform will be very appreciated :)

[18:17] <agentzh> i've only tested it on ubuntu feisty, but it should pass on other OSes like Win32 as well.

[18:19] <agentzh> In order to save room in the pugs repos, smartlinks2.t downloads the tarball containing the "freezed" pugs test suite, perl 6 synopses, and reference HTML outputs from feather itself.

[18:20] <moritz> agentzh: which "freezed" test suite?

[18:20] <agentzh> r15859

[18:21] <agentzh> or r15858

[18:21] <moritz> what's special about them?

[18:22] <agentzh> well, they're not really special.

[18:22] <agentzh> they've been frozen because i need to do regression.

[18:24] <agentzh>  smartlinks.pl lies on too many changing things and i have to freeze them somehow.

[18:24] <agentzh> *relies

[18:24] <moritz> agentzh: maybe you should explain that in the comments of the test file...

[18:25] <agentzh> moritz: good idea

[18:25] <agentzh> :)

[18:25] <moritz> agentzh: and if it depends on a package that's not used anywhere else you should also mention that...

[18:43] <svnbot6> r15861 | agentz++ | - added comments to clarify the indention and strategy for the regression

[18:43] <svnbot6> r15861 | agentz++ | test suite, suggested by moritz++

[18:43] <svnbot6> r15861 | agentz++ | - added comments for the extra non-core module dependencies

[18:43] <svnbot6> r15861 | agentz++ | - gives informative error messages when the non-core modules are not installed

[18:46] <svnbot6> r15862 | agentz++ | mentioned smartlinks2.t in smartlinks.pl

[18:49] <agentzh> once Pod::Simple::HTML changes its output template, my test suite will break horribly :(

[18:49] <svnbot6> r15863 | agentz++ | util/t/smartlinks2.t - fixed the path problem

[18:50] <agentzh> maybe i should "freeze" Pod::Simple::HTML too? like Module::Install bundles related packages?

[18:51] <agentzh> (yes, either way is a pain)
