[00:41] <Ziggy6> or is it? :)

[00:41] <diotalevi> It's also a totem animal for an english folk dance team in Minnesota.

[00:41] <tene> Often it's just a silly random mostly meaningless word.

[01:12] <masak> it says this in E02:

[01:12] <masak> %node<VALUE>  = $val but Found(0);

[01:12] <masak> (actually it said "is" but with a comment that "is" should be "but" nowadays)

[01:12] <masak> my question: is this current perl 6?

[01:13] <masak> what is Found(0) ? it's not a sub in the E02 example

[01:13] <tene> it's not currently implemented.

[01:13] <masak> but it's correct as it stands?

[01:14] <tene> Yes.

[01:14] <masak> hm

[01:14] * masak ponders the best compromise between leaving E02 as it is and making it work in Pugs now

[01:15] <masak> I'm about to commit a translation of E02, but it would feel better if it at least compiled first

[01:15] <TimToady> properties must be predeclared these days

[01:15] <masak> oh

[01:15] <TimToady> they're just mixins, really

[01:16] <masak> how do I predeclare them?

[01:16] <masak> example and/or reference to synopsis works

[01:16] <TimToady> with a role or enum declaration

[01:16] <TimToady> S12 discusses this

[01:16] <masak> I'll have a look

[01:16] <masak> (wow, hanging out on #perl6 writing perl 6 sure beats sleeping)

[01:17] <masak> so is Found(0) a constructor call or something?

[01:17] <TimToady> which copy of E2 were you working from?  the svn copy has Update sections that give some of the differences.

[01:19] <masak> I'm working from http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E02.html

[01:19] <lambdabot> Title: Exegesis 2: Bits and Pieces - perl6:

[01:19] <masak> it seems to have updates

[01:19] *** diakopter2 joined
[01:19] <masak> though perhaps not always completely up-to-date updates, I don't know

[01:22] <masak> ok, so I ended up writing this at the top of the file:

[01:22] <masak> role Found { submethod BUILD ($.times) {} }

[01:23] <masak> hm, maybe I should declare $.times as well...

[01:23] <masak> but it didn't seem to help, because pugs still complains about not finding the subroutine &Found

[01:23] <masak> is it at least theoretically correct?

[01:25] <TimToady> Found(0) is likelier to be viewed as a type coercion.  Not sure what pugs supports as a declaration of that currently, but whatever it is is probably wrong.  :)

[01:26] <masak> :)

[01:26] <TimToady> since I recently changed the spec to make method &.() the coercion syntax

[01:26] <TimToady> but in general one should be using enums for these kinds of things anyway.

[01:27] <masak> seems unlikely I will be able to make the code compile without removing its dependence on attributes, in other words

[01:27] <TimToady> um, attributes means something else in P6

[01:27] <masak> I see

[01:28] <masak> what I mean is "those things after 'does' or 'but'"

[01:28] <TimToady> properties

[01:28] <masak> right

[01:28] <TimToady> though declarative properties we usually call "traits"

[01:28] <masak> ...without removing its dependence on properties, in other words

[01:29] <TimToady> I don't know what pugs does with "but" currently.

[01:30] <TimToady> the assumption has been that if we get mixins working properly, the properties will fall out of that.

[01:30] <masak> ?eval my $a = 1 but { "hi" }

[01:30] <evalbot_r15386> \1

[01:31] <masak> seems it takes a block and ignores it at present

[01:31] <TimToady> ?eval say "hi" if 0 but True;

[01:31] <audreyt> I think it implements the monkey-but construct

[01:31] <evalbot_r15386> Error: Cannot cast from VBool True to Pugs.AST.Internals.VCode (VCode)

[01:31] <audreyt> which is not the same as mixins

[01:31] *** fglock joined
[01:34] <fglock> I've got a cool idea while driving home :)

[01:34] <fglock> mp6 now has a pugs backend

[01:35] <fglock> and I'll make a p6-parrot backend

[01:35] <fglock> so all my code is now reusable 

[01:36] <fglock> and mp6->parrot is straightforward

[01:36] <fglock> also mp6->haskell :)

[01:42] *** miyagawa joined
[01:43] <fglock> audreyt: I'm not sure if it is specced, but I use $/.to(3) in mp6 (it's an error in pugs, so I wrote a workaround)

[01:45] <TimToady> what is it supposed to mean?

[01:46] <fglock> change $/.to to 3 

[01:46] <TimToady> 3 what?

[01:46] <fglock> 3rd char in the matched string

[01:46] <TimToady> bet it's not

[01:47] <TimToady> at least, I'll bet some platforms would make it bytes instead of chars

[01:47] <TimToady> are you using it to set the final position back from where it ended up or forward?

[01:48] <audreyt> fglock: we did that because MP6 has no assignment... 

[01:48] <audreyt> also, relative positioning (and reuse unit) makes more sense

[01:48] <audreyt> oops, TimToady already said that.

[01:48] <audreyt> fglock: I wonder if  $/.to_char(3) makes sense...

[01:49] <audreyt> $/.set_to_char(3) # heh

[01:49] <TimToady> $/.set_current_to_position_to_char_number(3)  :)

[01:50] <TimToady> but why are we moving the position around in the first place?  Looking for the use case.

[01:50] <fglock> TimToady: inside a regex, it builds an empty Match and then set .to

[01:51] <TimToady> ah

[01:51] <fglock> as the match continues, .to keeps incrementing

[01:52] <TimToady> what I've been calling .pos, actually

[01:53] <TimToady> but that's probably confusing the matcher with the matchee

[01:55] *** weinig|away is now known as weinig

[01:55] <TimToady> $_.pos presumably gets set to $/.to at certain points when the user might ask for .pos, I suppose.

[01:55] <fglock> actually, I'm using an object called $MATCH, which is then copied to $/

[01:59] <fglock> I probably need some sleep before looking at this

[02:00] <fglock> mp6-on-pugs is currently using it's own $MATCH instead of pugs internal $/

[02:01] <fglock> so this can be fixed later

[02:02] <fglock> it's probably better to make mp6 and pugs just understand each other, so that no translation is needed - but 'cheat' was so inspiring :)

[02:06] <fglock> the code for mp6 token is very very short - it should be easily fixable once I understand all the problems: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-MiniPerl6/lib/MiniPerl6/Emitter/Token.pm

[12:04] <cmarcelo> :)

[12:06] <cmarcelo> audreyt: what's this "^Str vs. Str" thing?

[12:06] *** jiing joined
[12:10] <audreyt> cmarcelo: well in Perl 5

[12:10] <audreyt> you have

[12:10] <audreyt> 'DBI'->isa('DBI')

[12:10] <audreyt> right?

[12:11] <audreyt> that is, the string 'DBI' can be used as a "prototypical" DBI object

[12:11] <audreyt> from which you can create concrete instances

[12:11] <audreyt> it is an Invocant with an Empty layout 

[12:11] <audreyt> i.e. no attributes

[12:11] <audreyt> so far so good?

[12:11] <audreyt> it uses the same ResponderInterface as any other instances 

[12:11] <audreyt> but it has no attributes

[12:11] <audreyt> so you can only call methods on it that makes no use of attributes.

[12:12] <audreyt> in Perl 6, if you look at an object, say

[12:12] <audreyt> "hello world"

[12:12] <audreyt> you can similarily ask for its prototype

[12:12] <audreyt> via

[12:13] <audreyt> "hello world".WHAT

[12:13] <audreyt> which returns the prototypical Str

[12:13] <audreyt> written as ::Str

[12:13] <cmarcelo> (right..)

[12:13] <audreyt> but if it's in scope, can also be written as Str

[12:13] <audreyt> however

[12:13] <audreyt> Str.isa(Class)

[12:13] <audreyt> is _false_

[12:13] <audreyt> unlike in other languages

[12:14] <audreyt> to repeat: Str.isa(Str), but not Str.isa(Class)

[12:14] <audreyt> however, how do we get a list of methods of the Str class?

[12:14] <audreyt> we cannot say

[12:14] <audreyt> Str.methods

[12:14] <audreyt> because there is no &Str::methods method

[12:14] <audreyt> rather, to get the list of methods we rely on the &Class::methods API

[12:15] <audreyt> how do we get the class instance that backs up the Str object?

[12:15] <audreyt> we use 

[12:15] <audreyt> "hello world".HOW

[12:15] <audreyt> or

[12:15] <audreyt> Str.HOW # same thing

[12:15] <audreyt> it returns a Class instance

[12:15] <audreyt> because of that, Str.HOW.new constructs another Class instance, not a Str instance

[12:15] <audreyt> in any case, Str.HOW is abbreviated as ^Str

[12:16] <audreyt> and stringifies as such

[12:16] <audreyt> so you can say

[12:16] <audreyt> ^Str.methods

[12:16] <audreyt> to get the list of methods of the Str class

[12:16] <audreyt> or you can use the meta method quantifier:

[12:16] <audreyt> Str.^methods

[12:16] <audreyt> which is sugar for the same thing.

[12:16] <audreyt> end of explanation

[12:16] <audreyt> :)

[12:18] <cmarcelo> nice. thanks. So: Str.^methods == Str.HOW.methods == ^Str.methods

[12:18] <audreyt> correct.

[12:21] <cmarcelo> and: "hello world".^methods too, right? (if works for Str)

[12:24] <audreyt> right.

[12:24] <audreyt> but ^"hello world" does not do that

[12:24] <audreyt> rather it's shorthand for

[12:24] <audreyt> ""..^"hello world"

[17:59] <audreyt> (in the PureClass table)

[17:59] <gaal> you can derive Monad? how? and what >>= etc. do you get?

[18:00] <gaal> ooh! (commits shorter than the log)++ :)

[18:00] <audreyt> you can only derive it for newtype

[18:00] <audreyt> the powerful thing about ... is that you can return any Typeable stuff

[18:00] <audreyt> and once you supply a Boxable instance for it (in Pugs.Meta) then it automagically becomes first-class Perl6 object

[18:01] <audreyt> so for example

[18:01] <audreyt> +instance Boxable Eval a => Boxable Eval [a] where

[18:01] <audreyt> takes care of parametric Lists

[18:01] <audreyt> i.e. we are no longer constrained to double box and use [Val]

[18:01] <audreyt> now [ID] is just as first-class as [(Val, Val)] 

[18:01] <audreyt> using the same p6-land "list" method table

[18:02] <audreyt> this makes most method body oneliners :D

[18:04] <gaal> is [: :] a 6.6 thing?

[18:05] <audreyt> I think so

[18:05] <audreyt> might be earlier not sure

[18:05] <gaal> can you explain the difference between (...) and (!!!)?

[18:05] <audreyt> need to say -fparr

[18:06] <audreyt> "aliased_method" !!! (./ "another_method")

[18:06] <audreyt> is canonical example

[20:04] <TimToady> though arguably I'm cheating with Perl 6 by building lexing right into the grammars...

[20:06] <TimToady> grammatical categories are arguably just fancy lexer states.

[23:27] <TimToady> I'm not sure why you're looking for a distinction

[23:27] <putter> rule r :mumble1 :mumble2 {...}

[23:27] <putter> which is the name?

[23:27] <TimToady> the one that's attached to the name with no space

[23:27] <putter> if either?

[23:27] <TimToady> r:mumble

[23:28] <putter> ah, distinguished by non-space attachment.

[23:28] <putter> ok

[23:28] <TimToady> infix:<*> is a specific syntax of the more general infix:adverb() syntax

[23:29] <TimToady> we use infix:<*> in naming the final operators, but the rules to parse the operator specifically don't use that form.

[23:29] <TimToady> they all officially use infix:sym<*>

[23:29] <TimToady> just that infix:sym<foo> can be shortened to infix:foo

[23:30] <Limbic_Region> was the realclean after the initial MO bridge landed required by everyone or just me?

[23:30] <putter> nifty.  duplication of info gone, but naming remains.  yay.

[23:33] <TimToady> in fact, I usually just type ".testme" which does the realclean, reconfiger, and make smoke

[23:33] * putter wonders if adverbial names could be attached to multi methods too, as they have the same "how do you name it without playing longname typespace whack-a-mole" issue...

[23:33] <TimToady> I was thinking we might allow it

[23:33] *** avar joined
[23:33] <putter> :)

[23:34] <TimToady> basically the ident+adverb gives you unique names, but different dispatchers may choose to pay attention to those names differently.

[23:36] <TimToady> I've just been trying to figure out how to document that generalization, but $job is wanting me some these days, so haven't got to it.

[23:37] <TimToady> thought we might play with it a bit more in std before making it official anyway.

[23:38] <putter> sounds good

[23:39] <TimToady> also, the cheat program can now mangle the multi names into non-multi rules.  if you run it on std and look at the end of the result, you'll see what I mean.

[23:40] <putter> once there is the concept of adverbial naming of things, I'm not much concerned about whether it's attached or not.
