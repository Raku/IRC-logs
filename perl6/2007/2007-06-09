[06:08] <gummybearx> hi, i have a question:

[06:08] <gummybearx> is the new method invocation operator going to replace '->' or merely supplement it?

[06:09] <revdiablo> Replace

[06:09] <gummybearx> argh. ok, thanks

[06:09] <revdiablo> Why argh?

[06:09] <gummybearx> i kinda liked '->' tho. it was an eccentricity....

[06:10] <gummybearx> made perl unique.

[06:10] * Caelum likes -> too

[06:10] <Caelum> but . is more standard and all that

[06:10] <gummybearx> yeah, but we dont want to be like java, do we?

[06:11] <revdiablo> I always thought Perl used -> to look similar to C structs, or maybe that was just a coincidence

[06:12] <revdiablo> Though . is easier to type and fewer characters, so I don't really mind the change

[06:12] <gummybearx> well, i dk about c, but at first i thought '->' was crazy talk, coming from java

[06:12] <dduncan> -> never made Perl unique, it copied C

[06:12] <dduncan> and now . copies other things

[06:12] <revdiablo> gummybearx: It would take a lot more than syntax to make perl "be like" java in any significant way =)

[06:12] <dduncan> practically speaking, the . is much better huffmanizing than ->

[06:12] <gummybearx> weell, yes

[06:13] <dduncan> you invoke methods a lot, and . doesn't require using the shift key like -> does

[06:13] <gummybearx> thats true. strains my frail wrists

[06:13] <revdiablo> It's one keypress vs three

[06:14] <gummybearx> its prolly just change.... hard to get used to

[06:15] <gummybearx> if . is more common, then why has the foreach loop moved away from for my $x (@a) {}?

[06:16] <revdiablo> What?

[06:16] <dduncan> because for @foo -> $elem {} is much nicer

[06:16] *** Entonian joined
[06:17] <dduncan> way to do foreach

[06:17] <gummybearx> well.... it isnt as intuitive as saying foreach thing in bucket

[06:17] <revdiablo> dduncan++ # Deciphering

[06:17] <dduncan> besides, where is . used for foreaches?

[06:17] <gummybearx> seperate thought

[06:17] <dduncan> even in Perl 5, the recommended spelling of 'foreach' is 'for'

[06:17] <gummybearx> it isnt, two seperate thoughts

[06:18] <dduncan> so in Perl 5, one should say "for my $elem (@list) {}"

[06:18] <revdiablo> gummybearx: I can't imagine many people successfully rely on intuition to learn a programming language

[06:18] <gummybearx> i meant as a human would interpret the loop, in english

[06:18] <dduncan> for humans, the order works either way ...

[06:19] <dduncan> its "for each elem in list" vs "for each list elem"

[06:19] <dduncan> those being the perl 5 and 6 directions respectively

[06:19] <gummybearx> i suppose. like i said. teething.

[06:19] <dduncan> personally, I like nearly or entirely everything that perl 6 changed from perl 5, and perl 5 is otherwise my favorite programming language

[06:20] <revdiablo> gummybearx: You don't think the visual of the arrow pointing into the variable is intuitive?

[06:20] <revdiablo> dduncan: Yeah, it is a pleasure to write Perl 6 code

[06:20] <revdiablo> It feels just like I would imagine Perl done better

[06:20] <dduncan> uh-hu

[06:21] <gummybearx> revdiablo, i like the arrow, it makes you think $thing is "emerging" from list

[06:22] <gummybearx> but also reminiscent of a method invocation, just at a glance.... at least an old 5 invocation

[06:22] <revdiablo> You can't invoke a method on an array in perl 5 ;)

[06:23] <gummybearx> yea, i know, but if you were glancing over pages of code, it would be a "huh?" moment

[06:23] <gummybearx> but i digress

[06:23] <revdiablo> I don't think that reaction would last very long after learning Perl 6

[06:23] <gummybearx> haha, yes

[06:24] <Caelum> revdiablo: you can sorta with Autobox

[06:24] <revdiablo> Caelum: Quiet you!

[06:24] <Caelum> hehe

[06:25] <gummybearx> i agree with dduncan tho, perl has quickly become my favorite language

[06:29] <gummybearx> what is the date of release perl 6?

[16:26] <sparvu> hey

[16:26] <moritz> hi sparvu ;)

[16:27] <sparvu> I identified the problem with pugs and Solaris. Basically Im building now pugs on Solaris 10

[16:27] <sparvu> But on Solaris 11(aka Nevada, the next version of Solaris) the linker has been changed

[16:27] <sparvu> so the new ld(1) has introduced some extra checks which led to the mentioned errors

[16:27] <moritz> any workaround?

[16:28] <sparvu> Basically: if somebody will want to have pugs on Solaris, they must be on S10, not on Nevada

[16:28] <sparvu> At the moment I have escalated this with Sun's linker group

[16:28] <sparvu> they are looking into. Plus the ghc maintainer of Solaris 10 package

[16:28] <moritz> cool, sparvu++

[16:28] <sparvu> People are very commited to make things work :)

[16:29] <moritz> "things" seems to a good make target ;)

[16:30] <sparvu> yeah, the process of getting pugs running on Solaris is not very dirty but require some step. I will document soon on my site and post instructions

[16:30] <sparvu> I will first test couple of days and see if I can get as well this to work on S11

[16:30] <sparvu> I will keep you informed

[16:30] <sparvu> thanks all for help

[16:31] <moritz> it would be greate if you could contribute a section to the INSTALL file

[16:38] <sparvu> will do that later. I need to rerun the procedure several times - make sure everything is ok

[20:23] <rindolf> Hi all.

[20:23] <moritz> hi rindolf 

[20:23] <rindolf> Quick question - if ($$l !~ m{\G([^\<\[\]\&]*)}gms) - why does it sometimes fail to match.

[20:23] <rindolf> moritz: hi.

[20:24] <moritz> are you talking p5?

[20:25] <rindolf> moritz: yes, Perl 5.

[20:25] <moritz> hm, seems like a bug to me

[20:25] <moritz> anything* should always match

[20:28] *** justatheory joined
[20:30] <Tene> rindolf: can you provide an example of a non-matching string?

[20:34] <rindolf> Tene: wait a sec.

[20:35] <moritz> '[' doesn't match

[20:35] <moritz> sorry, does match... I missed the !~

[20:36] <rindolf> perl -e 'my $s = "[<hello>]" ; my $l = \$s; $$l =~ m{^\[}g; if (! $$l =~ m{\G([^\<]*)}) { die "Foo"; }'

[20:38] <rindolf> I mean I cannot reproduce it with perl -e 'my $s = "[<hello>]" ; my $l = \$s; $$l =~ m{^\[}g ; if ($$l !~ m{\G([^\<]*)}) { die "Foo"; }'

[20:38] <rindolf> Maybe it's a heisenbug.

[20:39] <moritz> does it occur without the referencing/dereferencing thingy?

[20:40] <moritz> maybe pos doesn't like references?

[20:40] <moritz> perl -wle 'my $s = "[<hello>]"; $s =~ m{^\[}g; die "Foo" if $s !~ m{\G([^\<]*)}';

[20:41] <moritz> does not die

[20:41] <Tene> rindolf: you don't need to escape < in a character class

[20:41] <rindolf> Tene: I know.

[20:41] <Tene> So why are you?

[20:45] *** marmic joined
[20:54] <rindolf> This makes no sense.

[20:55] <rindolf> Tene: to be on the safe side.

[20:55] <rindolf> Tene: in Perl 6 they have a meaning.

[20:55] <rindolf> The exact same string with the same expression now succeeds.
