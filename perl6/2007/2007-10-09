[11:37] *** pina joined
[11:37] <pina> ok not trying to troll but where all does python lack in comparison to ruby or perl

[11:38] <pina> besides syntaxes

[11:38] <masak> pina: what do you mean?

[11:38] <pina> i mean where is it inefficient

[11:38] <masak> hard to say, I think

[11:38] <pina> like python sometimes is inefficient for something perl handles easily

[11:39] <masak> regexes are maximally easy in Perl

[11:39] <masak> in Python you have to use slightly more cumbersome syntax

[11:39] <masak> also, Python is more type strict

[11:39] <masak> Perl is explicitly context-sensitive

[11:40] *** ilogger2 joined
[11:42] <pina> ok

[11:42] <pina> those are pretty basic

[11:42] <pina> just syntaxes

[11:42] <masak> well, yes

[11:43] <masak> sufficiently deep down all languages are the same

[11:43] <masak> though I would say that Python and Perl have different feels to them even mid-way down

[11:44] <masak> many aspects of Python were created with Perl in mind

[11:44] <masak> Python has "There should be only one obvious way to do it" as one of its slogans

[11:44] <masak> the Python 3000 design process was made to be dissimilar to the Perl 6 design process

[11:45] <masak> I'm not saying one is better than the other, or that people cannot be friends across cultures, or anything like that

[11:45] <pugs_svnbot> r18336 | fglock++ | [kp6] tested gather/take on an infinite loop

[11:45] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/18336

[11:45] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 18336 - Pugs - Trac

[11:46] <masak> it's just that Python in many ways seems to be a reaction to Perl

[11:46] <masak> it's not only that, of course

[11:46] <masak> it's also a quite clean and easy to read programming languages, with its basis in education

[11:50] <fglock> moritz_: would you install the Coro module from CPAN in the evalbot environment?

[11:51] *** CindyLinz joined
[11:53] *** ilogger2 joined
[11:59] <fglock> is the block in 'gather' always supposed to terminate? 

[11:59] <fglock> I guess not, since it is evaluated lazily

[12:03] <fglock> I suppose the block is killed when the gather return value is no longer needed (gets out of scope)?

[12:03] <masak> fglock: sounds reasonable

[12:04] <masak> in the end, it's just iterators anyway, I suppose

[12:08] <masak> fglock: is there any case where programs would behave differently depending on whether 'gather' blocks have to terminate or not?

[12:09] <moritz_> fglock: of course, wait a second...

[12:10] *** Shillo joined
[12:12] <fglock> masak: in the case when you have an infinite loop inside gather; kp6 currently just terminates the main program

[12:13] <moritz_> kp6: say "hello"

[12:13] <exp_evalbot> r18336: OUTPUT[hello␤]

[12:13] <masak> fglock: that's correct according to me iff the gathered array is not used

[12:13] <moritz_> fglock: does that mean everything is working again with evalbot?

[12:13] *** polettix joined
[12:14] <platypus> fglock: How does it detect an infinate loop?

[12:14] <fglock> http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/t/kp6/internals/02-gather.t

[12:14] <fglock> it is used, but just as needed

[12:14] <lambdabot> Title: /v6/v6-KindaPerl6/t/kp6/internals/02-gather.t - Pugs - Trac, http://tinyurl.com/yodmcp

[12:14] <masak> fglock: what do you mean?

[12:14] <fglock> platypus: it doesn't detect the loop; it runs until it gets enough data, then pause

[12:15] * platypus nods.

[12:15] <masak> fglock: if I understand you correctly, it sounds excellent

[12:15] <masak> the gather gets stuck in an infinite loop, but the program itself doesn't

[12:15] <fglock> masak: see the test

[12:15] <masak> oki

[12:15] <fglock> yep

[12:16] *** gorax joined
[12:16] <masak> re the test: yes, we agree

[12:16] <masak> excellent use of laziness, by me

[12:18] <masak> why is `gather` spelled `Gather.new`, btw?

[12:18] <masak> is that a kp6ism?

[12:19] <fglock> because it's not in the grammar yet

[12:19] <fglock> this is the internal representation

[12:19] <masak> wohoo, sounds like a fun thing to hack into the grammar! :)

[12:19] <fglock> masak: because it was just implemented a few minutes ago :P

[12:19] <masak> ah

[12:20] <masak> fglock++

[12:27] <Shillo> fglock: Do you plan to make it truly lazy, eventually?

[12:28] <Shillo> I mean, generate nothing when called, and only generate -precisely- as much as needed?

[12:28] <fglock> Shillo: it does already

[12:28] <Shillo> Goodie. :)

[12:29] <Shillo> For a moment I thought you were describing something like unix buffered pipes, so I commented. Sowwy.

[12:30] *** iblechbot joined
[12:30] <Shillo> Come to think of it, making the lazy lists buffered could be very useful. Because then you could autoparalelize to a different thread.

[12:31] <moritz_> but then you can't guarantee "true" lazyness

[12:31] <moritz_> we need a new trait, "is half-lazy" ;)

[12:31] <Shillo> Yeah, I know. :)

[12:31] <Shillo> Well, umm, train creep = evil. ;) Maybe just a proxy-list in standard library

[12:32] <Shillo> Er, trait creep :)

[12:35] <fglock> Shillo: I don't get it - can you give an example?

[12:36] * Shillo thinks...

[12:36] <moritz_> fglock: you can define lazy lists recursively

[12:37] <moritz_> @a = (0, 1, @[*-1] + @[*-2])

[12:37] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: activity activity-full admin all-dicts arr ask . v

[12:37] <moritz_> that should generate the fibonaccy numbers lazyly

[12:37] <Shillo> moritz_: You can do that with normal laziness, too

[12:37] <moritz_> now if have a sub that read from that list, you have to switch between the list calculation and the callling sub

[12:37] <pugs_svnbot> r18337 | fglock++ | [kp6] added 'gather' to the grammar; needs some AST work

[12:37] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/18337

[12:37] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 18337 - Pugs - Trac

[12:38] <Shillo> Normal gather would create an object that contains list_so_far and a continuation that makes more

[12:38] <moritz_> but if you did some buffering, you could move the liist calculation into its own thread

[12:38] <Shillo> Threaded gather would have list_so_far, a semaphore and a thread

[12:38] <moritz_> and run them in parallel

[12:38] <Shillo> list_so_far would now contain more than needed, and the thread would block until more is required

[12:39] <Shillo> I suspect this is the primitive you need to implement hyperops and pipes with gather

[12:39] <Shillo> Not sure if semaphore is the right locking primitive, of course. Possibly not.

[12:39] <moritz_> reboot &

[12:40] <Shillo> Could be just a pair of mutexes instead. ACtually, probably is, becuase this is producer-consumer pattern

[12:40] <Shillo> But honestly, I don't think this belongs to the core language. Maybe into the runtime library

[12:41] <Shillo> You actually need it (or something like it) for autothreaded primitives.

[12:42] <Shillo> Actually, this is another good problem: Pester @Larry into thinking about interactions about autothreading and laziness

[12:42] *** pmurias joined
[12:42] <pmurias> hi

[12:43] <Shillo> As in, is @a >>+<< @b lazy list? Or does it autothread? Or, if it does both, how?

[12:43] <Shillo> Hiya!

[12:43] <masak> Shillo: good question

[12:44] <pmurias> list context is lazy by default

[12:44] <pmurias> (is what i heard)

[12:44] <Shillo> That doesn't completely answer my question, though.

[12:44] <Shillo> Or rather, it doesn't answer 3rd part of it.

[12:45] <Shillo> Basically, if it splits @a and @b into sublists and assigns them to threads, the question becomes, when do you do the summing?

[12:45] <Shillo> ... of the middle chunks?

[12:46] <fglock> Shillo: you do the sum just when you need the result

[12:46] <Shillo> fglock: This isn't what autothreading implies, though

[12:46] <masak> @ask TimToady about the interactions between autothreading and laziness. what happens in the following case? my @a = gather { ... }; my @c = @a >>+<< @b; does the calculation of @c happen lazily, or does it autothread only after the calculation of @a is complete?

[12:46] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[12:47] <Shillo> Because lazy = as needed, as late as possible. Autothreading = random order, hardware/os-dependent time. The two don't seem compatible by default.

[12:48] <Shillo> I'm not saying that they can't be made compatible, but it's worthy thinking about.

[15:04] <Aankhen``> I'm confused.  Do packages, modules, classes and roles share the same namespace or do they not?

[15:06] <[particle]> one part of this that i think i understand clearly is Class has-many Namespace

[15:06] <[particle]> in other words, you can alias classnames

[15:07] <Aankhen``> How so?

[15:08] <[particle]> i'm looking for something to support that in the synopses

[15:08] <[particle]> however, i know parrot's namespace/class design is that way to allow perl 6 aliasing

[15:09] <[particle]> and grammars

[16:10] <TimToady> @messages

[16:10] <lambdabot> masak asked 3h 24m 14s ago: about the interactions between autothreading and laziness. what happens in the following case? my @a = gather { ... }; my @c = @a >>+<< @b; does the calculation of @c

[16:10] <lambdabot> happen lazily, or does it autothread only after the calculation of @a is complete?

[16:12] <TimToady> the hyperops wants to run to completion, and pretends the array is all there for scheduling threaded execution

[16:12] <TimToady> if it isn't all there, then the thread in question will have to wait until its values start arriving from the gather

[16:13] <TimToady> on the earlier question, I have always felt that laziness should be allowed to happen in batches by default

[16:13] <TimToady> you shouldn't be relying on laziness happening in a particular order

[16:13] <TimToady> that should be considered harmful

[16:14] <TimToady> so if a thread wants to work ahead a little, I don't see why it shouldn't.

[16:15] <TimToady> most of these parallel operators in Perl 6 explicitly promise that you don't care about order of evaluation

[16:15] <TimToady> and even laziness doesn't really care about order of evaluation, just order of the resulting values

[16:17] <TimToady> but we basically give the list optimizer three settings on the dial: lazy, eager, and hyper 

[16:17] <[particle]> s/list optimizer/teenager/

[16:17] <TimToady> rofl

[16:22] <TimToady> the basic assumption is that a lazy list may not be interested in all its values; an eager list is interested in all its values and cares about order of evaluation; hyper wants all values but doesn't care about order of evaluation.

[16:22] <TimToady> (and junctions don't care about order of evaluation and don't necessarily want all their values)

[17:55] <avar> pmurias: But as CL shows you can have lots of carefully crafted dymanism without slowing everything else down, if you're ready to drop som features

[17:56] <pmurias> swimming&

[17:58] <fglock> Scope.pm is mostly meant for implementing lexical scopes and closures in backends that don't support it natively

[18:00] <avar> People studying how to design an optimizable dynamic language would do well to study CL, it was basically designed by a bunch of compiler implementors who knew what they were doing and what they needed to fix:)

[18:00] <avar> *hint* *hint* :)

[18:03] <avar> But it's clear that Perl 6 won't be as fast as CL in the general case since there's a lot of stuff that prevents you from compiling it to optimized assembly, and some of this stuff is hard to figure out statically by a compiler

[18:03] * integral notes that plenty of people can tell you what makes perl 5 hard to run fast, but little of it has changed for perl 6

[18:03] *** scent joined
[18:05] <avar> integral: That's not right, the biggest thing holding perl 5 back I'd say is magic. It's not copied in perl6 unless you bind the variable

[18:06] <avar> with that and the type system you can optimize stuff like sub add(int $a, int $b --> int) { $a + $b }

[18:06] <avar> (see sial.org paste earlier)

[18:07] <integral> avar: But how many people are going to put enough annotations on their code?

[18:08] <integral> but you're right, magic is mostly gone which is nice :-)

[18:09] <avar> integral: few, but you can do it for parts which need optimizing

[22:58] <avar> fax: interested in more hackery?:)

[22:58] <fax> yeah :)

[22:59] <fax> Looks like @source[0] = 2; has broken

[22:59] <fax> in kp6

[22:59] <fax> hows progress?

[23:00] <avar> we're passing a few more tests, but now we need the object model:)

[23:01] <avar> look at lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/MOP.pm

[23:02] <avar> The core so to speak being ::DISPATCH

[23:02] <avar> basically that's the Perl 6 object model in Perl 5. You define an object in a non-std way in Perl 5 that has a name, parents, some functions etc.

[23:03] <avar> Everything works in that model so you can tell a Str instance to tell you its length in chars for instance and it knows to look up its method, its parents method and so on

[23:04] <avar> I haven't done anything in it but I've been wondering to what amount that can be layered on top of CLOS and some standard slots/methods. So far I haven't seen any reason not to do that

[23:04] <fax> mhm

[23:04] <fax> CLOS is possible you can use the metaobject protocol in CLOS to change most all behavior 

[23:04] <avar> ...and using CLOS would mean not implementing your own method resolution mechanism from a class higherarchy 

[23:05] <fax> [if that was needed]

[23:05] <avar> yup

[23:08] <avar> echo 'my %hash = (key => "value"); say %hash.elems' | perl script/kp6 | perltidy

[23:08] <avar> that's a good example

[23:08] <avar>         ::DISPATCH( $GLOBAL::Code_say, 'APPLY',

[23:08] <avar>             ::DISPATCH( $Hash_hash, 'elems', ) )

[23:14] <fax> ah ok I get it

[23:16] <avar> basically we've been doing a lot of this stuff wrong:)

[23:17] <avar> assignment for example in kp6-perl is just:

[23:17] <avar> '::DISPATCH_VAR( ' ~ $node.emit_perl5 ~ ', \'STORE\', ' ~ $.arguments.emit_perl5 ~ ' )' ~ Main::newline();

[23:19] *** devogon joined
[23:20] <fax> hm so are you thinking about implementing the object model and then changing most of the lisp emitter stuff to use it like that?

[23:20] <avar> Yeah
