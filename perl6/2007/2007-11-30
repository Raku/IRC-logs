[00:29] <neuromu> hi everyone. i'm sure this is common knowledge already, but i'm new to pugs and perl6. make smoke is not creating a smoke.html with latest revision from svn.

[00:31] <neuromu> I get an error referencing YAML in the perl distribution I'm using, something about a malformed UTF-8 char.

[00:50] <neuromu> 5.8.8

[00:55] <neuromu> Is there still a need for more help on developing perl 6/pugs?

[00:57] <neuromu> if so, i'd really like to help, i've been in awe of this project watching from the outside off and on for about a year and a half now

[00:57] <neuromu> my email is [email@hidden.address]
[00:59] <Tene> neuromu: kp6 and parrot are where the most is happening right now. :)

[01:02] <neuromu> Tene: thanks. Is there a plan to write a C implementation for Perl 6?

[01:03] <neuromu> Or is that Parrot...

[01:03] <Tene> neuromu: That's Parrot.

[01:03] <[particle]> neuromu: we can start by giving you a pugs commit bit, so i've sent you an invitation

[01:04] *** stekodyne left
[01:04] <neuromu> [particle] -> thank you.

[01:04] <[particle]> neuromu: there's parrot, a c-based vm for perl6 and other dynamic languages, and there's yap6 (sp?) which is a c port of fglock's kp6 (kindaperl 6)

[01:05] <[particle]> those are the two c-based implementations underway

[01:05] *** ether0 left
[01:11] <[particle]> neuromu: typically new committers add their name to CREDITS to test out their bit

[01:11] <neuromu> I can't seem to find the yap6 description anywhere...

[01:11] <[particle]> look under the v6/ dir

[01:11] <[particle]> i've been away for a month, so i don't know the latest info

[01:12] <[particle]> if you're interested in c programming, parrot could use your help

[01:13] <TimToady> s/CREDITS/AUTHORS/ # a forgivable slip twixt parrot and pugs

[01:13] <[particle]> ah, thanks

[01:14] <neuromu> heck yeah im interested in c programming

[01:14] <neuromu> so add my name to AUTHORS?

[01:15] <TimToady> *nod*

[01:21] <pugs_svn> r18985 | neuromu++ | Added name to AUTHORS

[16:51] <masak> yes, that one is very cool

[16:51] <masak> agentzh++

[16:52] <Juerd> Some perl -Mre=debug alike output would be cool too

[16:53] <Juerd> I know that a lot of work is being done on Perl 6, but the things that I can *see* (e.g. in a browser) always impress me most.

[16:57] <TimToady> moritz_: there isn't really a hash context; pairs don't decide how to behave until they get bound or assigned, so list context generally suffices (of course there's a referential context that expects a hash object/role, but that's just a type)

[16:57] <moritz_> TimToady: ok, thanks

[16:58] <moritz_> the question came up on #perlde, someone sugested a DBI like interface with a magic "fetch" method

[16:58] <moritz_> where %a = $sth->fetch returns a hash, @a = $sth->fetch a list, and $a = $sth->fetch an array ref

[16:59] <moritz_> and afaict the first two can't be distinguished in perl 5

[17:00] <Tene> TimToady: There's concern expressed in the log of the phone conference about your hardware.  You need new hardware?

[17:04] <Tene> Heh.  Mine does that too.

[17:05] <rgs> TimToady: I've that question about ~~ in Perl 5

[17:05] <rgs> just to be sure

[17:05] <rgs> before we're stuck with it forever

[17:05] <TimToady> and I've got a bizillion messages saying hub 1-0:1.0: over-current change on port 3

[17:05] <Juerd> moritz_: Why would $a = $sth->fetch do an arrayref, not a hashref? And why are you calling it a ref? :)

[17:05] <TimToady> and the space bar doesn't work some of the time when I push it with my right thumb

[17:06] <Tene> USB on my laptop is too flaky to use at high-speed, so I always rmmod ehci_hcd when I need to use it.

[17:06] <TimToady> rgs: what's the Q?

[17:06] <rgs> have you tried compressed air ? (for the laptop)

[17:06] <rgs> and the real question is : @a ~~ %h means that at least one element of @a is a key in %h ?

[17:06] <rgs> (as opposed as "all elements of @a")

[17:07] <moritz_> Juerd: convenience ;)

[17:08] <TimToady> S03 sez:

[17:08] <TimToady>     Array     Hash      hash slice existence    X.contains(any @$_)

[17:08] <rgs> yup

[17:08] <moritz_> which means "one common item", right?

[17:08] <moritz_> that is, "at least one common item"

[17:09] <rgs> that's what I think

[17:09] <rgs> but I'm not an expert in exegesis

[17:09] <moritz_> TimToady: Hash has no method "contains", according to S29, so it must be some kind of meta syntax

[17:09] <TimToady> yes, only one item needs to match

[17:09] <rgs> thanks! then all is fine in P5.

[17:10] <TimToady> and .contains is a key match

[17:10] <TimToady> not a val match

[17:11] <TimToady> P6 kind of views hashes as sets with an associated piece of data called the value

[17:13] <TimToady> Tene: yeah, my shoulder biceps tendons don't like to be used quite as much as I use 'em.

[17:13] <TimToady> and I've been having trouble sleeping because of it, which greatly reduces my productivity

[17:13] <TimToady> but I think I'm getting better, except when I don't think that...

[17:13] <Tene> TimToady: want I should buy you a nicer external keyboard?  Christmas time and all.

[17:14] <TimToady> doesn't seem to correlate with keyboard use, more with heavy lifting and pushing the car door open and such

[17:15] <TimToady> and I've got lots of keyboards sitting around  :)

[17:16] <Tene> I figured that was probably the case, but most of my spare keyboards are spare because they're a pain to type on.

[17:16] <Tene> Seems to be a common attribute of spare keyboards. ;)

[17:16] <TimToady> most of mine are spare because the new computer came with a new one, and with four kids you end up with lots of new computers periodically

[17:17] <TimToady> and keyboards are the easiest thing to scavenge from an old computer

[17:17] <[particle1> at least you have other people to do the heavy lifting for perl 6

[17:18] <TimToady> sure, but that's kind of like ants trying to decide which way to push the huge crumb :)

[17:19] *** [particle1 is now known as [particle]

[17:20] <Tene> Work threw more money at me recently, and hardware is an easy donation.

[17:21] <[particle]> how 'bout a right-handed dvorak keyboard

[17:22] *** drrho left
[17:22] <TimToady> hmm, my sister-in-law just had new hardware installed in her shoulder...

[17:23] <Tene> bbl

[17:23] <[particle]> i can get you the joint itself at wholesale, but i can't get you a discount on labor

[17:23] <TimToady> can you do it on a volunteer basis?

[17:24] <TimToady> I'll bet TPF would give you a tax writeoff for it...

[17:24] <[particle]> tempting

[17:25] *** masak left
[17:25] <[particle]> besides, what could happen?

[17:48] <fglock> hmm - looks ok, here

[17:48] *** ebassi joined
[17:50] <moritz_> fglock: where is your AST.pm?

[17:51] <fglock> t-bootstrap uses this one: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/compiled/perl5-kp6-kp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Ast.pm

[17:51] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/3d3sas

[17:52] <moritz_> ah, that's Ast.pm, not AST.pm

[17:53] <fglock> please fix it if possible, I'm on os/x and it doesn't care :(

[17:53] <pugs_svn> r19000 | moritz++ | [kp6] fixed include in t-bootstrap/02-grammar.t

[17:53] <moritz_> Committed revision 19000.

[17:54] <moritz_> it dies with a segfault, but at least it compiles

[17:54] <moritz_> (case insenstive file systems)--

[17:55] <ruoso> dlocaus, fglock told me you're interested in yap6

[17:56] *** pmurias joined
[17:57] *** snearch joined
[17:58] <fglock> moritz_: which perl5 do you use?

[17:58] <moritz_> fglock: 5.8.8

[17:58] <fglock> a segfault in a perl5 regex can make this regex engine unusable

[17:59] * moritz_ installs 5.10

[17:59] <fglock> it abuses a little on regexes 

[17:59] <fglock> I'm running 5.8.8

[17:59] <moritz_> with 5.10: # Can't use an undefined value as a SCALAR reference at compiled/perl5-kp6-kp6/lib/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Match.pm line 54.

[17:59] <moritz_> at the same plase where 5.8.8 dies with a segfault

[18:00] *** justatheory joined
[18:00] <moritz_> s/plase/place/

[18:01] <pmurias> there are no segfaults here, but test 2 and 3 fail

[18:01] <moritz_> seems to be an issue with debian's perl

[18:02] <fglock> pmurias: that's ok - but a segfault is way hard to fix

[18:02] <pmurias> moritz_: you use perl t-bootstrap/02-grammar.t ?

[18:02] <moritz_> pmurias: aye

[18:03] *** justatheory left
[18:04] *** justatheory joined
[18:04] <moritz_> I just checked out a fresh copy of kp6 to ensure it's not a tainted checkout... still the same behaviour

[18:05] <fglock> hmm - there is an eval-block in that place - I'll try to remove it

[18:06] <fglock> the segfault might be caused by an error in the exception handler

[18:06] <dlocaus> ruoso: I think that may have been a mis-understanding

[18:07] *** justatheory left
[18:07] <dlocaus> ruoso: I don't have a lot of time to "share", right now I have time for 1.5 volunteer projects, and kp6 + another are already taking up a lot of my time :)

[18:08] <dlocaus> ruoso: sorry about the late response, I was moving my car for street cleaning

[18:08] <pmurias> dlocaus: what's the "other" project? ;)

[18:08] <dlocaus> A non profit wants me to help rebuild their website.

[18:08] <pmurias> dlocaus: dosn't the street cleaning get annoying?

[18:08] <dlocaus> I really hate working for free, for people who get paid.  For some reason the value of my time drops to "negative numbers"

[18:09] <pugs_svn> r19001 | fglock++ | [kp6-perl5rx] minor change trying to avoid an exception

[18:09] <dlocaus> pmurias: yes, the street cleaning does get annoying, but its considerably less annoying than all the other idiot legislation and laws passed by local, state, and federal government.

[18:09] <moritz_> fglock: no change hehe, still segfault

[18:09] <moritz_> fglock: and don't take my "in the same place" too serious

[18:10] *** justatheory_ joined
[18:10] <fglock> moritz_: ok

[18:10] <moritz_> fglock: the error message appeared in the same place, that doesn't mean the failure was in the same place

[18:10] <dlocaus> In the state of califonria, to make a left turn (drivers drive on the right side of the road), it is illegal to go "partially" out into the intersection before you make a left turn.  Ergo, it is no almost impossible to make a left turn.  We can blame Jackie Spier for that.

[18:10] *** justatheory_ left
[18:11] <fglock> I'll try it out on a new 5.10 install

[18:11] <dlocaus> I could go on for a couple more hours, but I'll spare you. ;)

[18:11] * moritz_ doesn't understand why USA's laws are so much fractured

[18:12] <dlocaus> moritz_: responding in a private irc window

[18:12] <moritz_> nor why any sane country would allow local laws to override country scale law ;)

[18:17] <fglock> the devel version in cpan is 5.9.5, dated 7/19/07 - is this correct?

[18:17] *** ebassi left
[18:17] <dlocaus> no

[18:17] <dlocaus> 5.10.rc 2 is out

[18:17] <fglock> have a link?

[18:18] <dlocaus> one second

[18:18] <moritz_> fglock: just use the latest blead: http://dev.perl.org/perl5/source.html

[18:18] <lambdabot> Title: Getting and Working With the Perl Source - perl5

[18:18] <fglock> dev.perl.org doesn't help

[18:21] <fglock> thanks

[18:22] *** justatheory joined
[18:25] <pmurias> fglock: wouldn it be better/cleaner to change Emit::Perl5Regex to use Perl6::Match?

[18:26] *** justatheory_ joined
[18:26] *** justatheory left
[18:28] <pmurias> * wouldn't

[18:28] <fglock> pmurias: I'm still debugging the perl5rx backend, specially " from_global_data() "

[18:28] <fglock> we can split the Perl 5 specifics to a separate module later

[18:29] <fglock> that is, if the segfault can be fixed

[18:30] <pmurias> fglock: do you get the segfault?

[18:30] <fglock> no, it works here - I'm now installing 5.10 

[18:31] <moritz_> it works on a different debian maschine for me

[18:31] <moritz_> so not sure where my problem is, actually

[18:31] <damianc> now whats an automation for provisioning?

[18:32] *** lichtkind left
[18:33] <pmurias> damianc: what's the context?

[18:34] *** Entonian joined
[18:34] <fglock> moritz_: nice to know :)

[18:35] <damianc> something for a DC frontend?
