[00:00] <Aankhen``> It wasn't too hard to get most of CPAN installed, though.

[00:00] <Aankhen``> I just said `i Task::Catalyst`.

[00:00] <Caelum> Tene: I wouldn't ask for one until I actually have something to commit :)

[00:00] <Caelum> haha

[00:00] <Tene> Aankhen``: find /usr/lib/perl5 -cmin -30 -print0|xargs -0 rm

[00:02] <Aankhen``> Tene: What does that do? Sorry, I'm not familiar with `find` syntax beyond -name.

[00:03] <Tene> Aankhen``: finds all files created in the last 30 minutes.

[00:03] <Aankhen``> Oh, neat.

[00:03] <Tene> actually, you'd probably want to redirect the 'find' output to a file and go through it by hand

[00:03] <Tene> just to be sure

[00:03] <Aankhen``> I dunno why I was parsing -cmin as -c, -m, -i and -n.

[00:03] <Aankhen``> Guess it must be needing to sleep.

[00:04] <Tene> Perhaps!

[10:53] <Gothmog_> func() differs from func (), so print (func 2, 3), @bar; now prints @bar, too, and you don't have to say print((func 2, 3), @bar) any more.

[20:46] <thoughtpolice> and since today was the last day of school, i have plenty of time to write during the summer.

[20:46] <thoughtpolice> thanks.

[20:47] <moritz> ?eval "123" ~~ m/.+/; +$/

[20:47] <thoughtpolice> i remember seeing blogs like "dive into INTERCAL" and I thought "why doesn't perl 6 have it's own 'dive into'?"

[20:47] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[20:47] <evalbot_r16524> 123.0

[20:47] <thoughtpolice> but so far i've been getting some good feedback

[20:47] <moritz> thoughtpolice: it's a pity that I can't comment without a google account

[20:48] <moritz> otherwise it's very cool ;)

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> moritz: i can change that right quick

[20:48] <spinclad> in INTERCAL that's "PLEASE dive from <otherlang>"

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> haha

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> i actually wrote some INTERCAL recently

[20:48] <thoughtpolice> to count from 1 to 10, but I never got it to fully work, I mean, it counted, but it failed on err after it was done.

[20:49] <thoughtpolice> i'm actually writing 'round 2' for the blog right now, but I'm sort of compiling the latest pugs repo.

[20:50] <fglock> thoughtpolice: re blog - "say @arr[1]; //this will output 2" should read "say @arr[1]; # this will output 2"

[20:50] <Aankhen``> spinclad++ # ROTFLMAO

[20:51] <spinclad> INTERCAL teaches politeness

[20:51] <thoughtpolice> fglock: oh, right. sorry :)

[20:51] <thoughtpolice> Aankhen``: I edited the post and gave you a shout out :)

[20:51] <fglock> home &

[20:51] <Aankhen``> thoughtpolice: Heh, cool.

[20:51] <thoughtpolice> fglock: i changed that too.

[20:52] <thoughtpolice> keep the errata coming, guys. i'd appreciate it. :)

[20:52] *** the_dormant_ joined
[20:52] <thoughtpolice> moritz: I changed the comment setting; if you still want to, go for it. :)

[20:52] <moritz> thoughtpolice: you write about "builtin functions" that can be called like methods - that's because they _are_ _methods_, not functions

[20:53] <moritz> that's what I wanted to comment ;)

[20:53] <thoughtpolice> ah. thanks.

[20:53] <thoughtpolice> :)

[20:54] <thoughtpolice> like I said, if you guys would keep pointing out errata i'd appreciate it; it'd help progress the blog and keep it up to date.

[20:55] <Aankhen``> Sur.e

[20:55] <Aankhen``> s/.e/e./

[20:55] <moritz> can I use m/ <( ... )> | something/ in a regex?

[20:56] <Aankhen``> Whatcha mean?

[20:56] <moritz> rather m/ '"'<( ... )>'"' | something/ 

[20:56] <Aankhen``> Seems like valid syntax to me.

[20:56] <moritz> ok

[20:56] <Aankhen``> Er, what are you trying to do?

[20:56] <moritz> Aankhen``: I'm parsing apache log files...

[20:56] <moritz> Aankhen``: and the referer is either a - or "..."

[20:56] <Aankhen``> Ohh.

[20:56] <Aankhen``> / '...' | something /

[20:57] <moritz> Aankhen``: and in case of "..." I don't want the quotes in the match object

[20:57] <Aankhen``> / '"' <( '...' )> '"' | something /

[20:57] <Aankhen``> <( ... )> # AIUI, this matches three characters and saves that as the match object.

[20:57] <moritz> <( <-["]> )> actually

[20:57] <Aankhen``> Well, you know what I mean. ;-)

[20:58] <moritz> Aankhen``: the ... were metsayntactic ;)

[20:58] <Aankhen``> Oh.

[20:58] <Aankhen``> Mmm.

[20:58] <Aankhen``> Yes, well, seems like valid syntax.

[20:58] <Aankhen``> "Either match these characters and save the result in $/, or match something else."

[21:05] <moritz> commitbit not working/timeouting again :(

[21:06] <moritz> a few minutes ago there was a patch posted

[21:06] <moritz> should I incorporate it, or just send a commitbit to the poster?

[21:06] <moritz> or apply the patch, and ask him if he want a commitbit?

[21:07] <Tene> moritz: a patch to commitbit?

[21:07] <moritz> Tene: no, to pugs ;)

[21:08] <moritz> sorry, was jumping between topics ;)

[21:08] <obra> Anyone who wants a commitbit commitbit should poke me ;)

[21:08] * Aankhen`` commits bits of obra.

[21:10] <moritz> ok, I'm applying the patch

[21:11] <svnbot6> r16526 | moritz++ | patch and test cases for zero or negative argument to 'x' and 'xx' operator

[21:11] <svnbot6> r16526 | moritz++ | postet ond p6l by chas_owens++

[21:20] <svnbot6> r16527 | rhr++ | lots of little fixes etc. Aankhen``++

[21:24] <Aankhen``> rhr: One comment.  If you just say `token m { ... }`, doesn't that match three characters in a row rather than functioning as the yada yada yada operator?

[21:24] <wolverian> hm, apache2 is eating a lot of pu

[21:24] <wolverian> er, cpu

[21:24] <Aankhen``> NO PU.

[21:26] <Aankhen``> rhr: My suggestion was `token m { { ... } }` and so on.

[21:26] <moritz> pugs build is taking lots of memory - the ony thing that regularly consumes more on my box is enblend

[21:26] <moritz> s/ony/only/

[21:26] <Aankhen``> What's enblend?

[21:27] <Aankhen``> Ugh.

[21:27] * Aankhen`` wanders off to shower.

[21:27] <moritz> Aankhen``: when you stitch panorma images that maks the colors smoother

[21:27] <Yaakov> Yes, I feel dirty too!

[21:27] <moritz> at the edges of images

[21:29] <rhr> Aankhen``: doh!

[21:36] <svnbot6> r16529 | moritz++ | added an example log file parser in its early stage to misc/pX/Common/

[22:05] <Aankhen``> moritz: Ah, I see.  Interesting app.

[22:05] <Aankhen``> Yaakov: That's because you *are* dirty. Filthy. All that sort of stuff.

[22:06] <Aankhen``> rhr: Heh, no worries, it happens. ;-)

[22:06] <moritz> Aankhen``: any idea what might be problem?

[22:06] <moritz> or just an implementation bug?

[22:06] <Aankhen``> moritz: Sorry, I meant <moritz> Aankhen``: when you stitch panorma images that maks the colors smoother

[22:06] <Aankhen``> Haven't seen the parser yet.

[22:06] <moritz> Aankhen``: ok ;)

[22:07] <Aankhen``> Do keep in mind that most major features don't work yet with regards to rules. :-(

[22:07] <Aankhen``> $<requesttype> := <+[A-Z]> # usually GET or POST # I'm guessing that's the problem...

[22:08] <Aankhen``> ?eval my $foo = "abcd"; $foo ~~ /$<bar> := (..) $/; $/<bar>

[22:08] *** evalbot_r16524 is now known as evalbot_r16527

[22:08] <evalbot_r16527> *** Cannot parse regex: $<bar> := (..) $␤*** Error: ␤\undef

[22:09] <moritz> damned, A-Z is old syntax

[22:09] <Aankhen``> yus thut too

[22:09] <moritz> Aankhen``: the regex you just posted works for me locally

[22:10] <Aankhen``> Hmm, you're right.

[22:10] <moritz> that's just evalbot's weirdness with character classes

[22:10] <Aankhen``> Hey, isn't there no \v any more?

[22:10] <Aankhen``> $<url> := (\v+)

[22:10] <moritz> where?

[22:11] <moritz> i looked in S05 before I wrote that

[22:11] <moritz> it was still there

[22:11] <Aankhen``> Oh, whoops.

[22:12] <Aankhen``> Hmm, which one was it that disappeared?

[22:12] <moritz> still, the output is "invalid aliased subrule"

[22:12] <Aankhen``> Yeah.

[22:12] <Aankhen``> By the way... token remotehost  { \V+ };         # anything but horizontal spaces

[22:12] <Aankhen``> Don't you want \H+ there since you want anything but horizontal spaces?

[22:12] <moritz> ah, right

[22:14] <moritz> maybe it's a problem that the tokens and the object variables have the same name

[22:14] <Aankhen``> Durr.  I didn't realize that non-working examples shouldn't be in examples/.

[22:23] <rhr> hmm, should I move examples/rules/unitsdat-grammar.pm to misc/pX/Common/Units.pm or something like that?

[22:40] <Aankhen``> rhr: I was trying to figure out whether I should move mine too.

[22:40] <Aankhen``> Though I take heart from the fact that examples/rules/basic.pl doesn't work either.
