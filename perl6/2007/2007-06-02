[01:56] <agentzh> morning, TimToady :)

[01:57] <TimToady> the only problem with morning is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of the day...

[01:57] <TimToady> except when it's an inconvenient place in the world...

[01:58] *** REPLeffect joined
[01:59] * agentzh gets confused by TimToady's inconvenience.

[01:59] <Caelum> does vim have a syntax file for perl6?

[01:59] * TimToady gets inconvenienced by agentzh's confusion  :)

[02:00] <TimToady> Caelum: yes

[02:00] <agentzh> Caelum: i believe there is one in the pugs repos :)

[02:00] <TimToady> see util/perl6.vim

[02:00] <Caelum> ahh cool :)

[02:01] <Caelum> what extension should perl6 files end with?

[02:01] <agentzh> .pl is confusing but...

[02:01] <agentzh> fglock++ chooses .p6 though.

[02:03] <agentzh> people, i'm translating the Synopses to Chinese. where should i put the translated version in the pugs tree?

[02:06] <Limbic_Region> oh, my smoke time after the pad refactor became stabalized is as fast or faster as before - circa 1/2 hour

[02:06] <Limbic_Region> apparently it slowed down considerably right after the refactor

[02:06] <agentzh> 200+ min

[02:07] *** weinigLap joined
[02:08] * Limbic_Region doesn't know if that is considered faster, slower, or normal

[02:08] <agentzh> much much slower

[02:09] <agentzh> or maybe that's because the auto-smoke now has a nice number of 10 or even 15 :)

[02:09] <Limbic_Region> dunno, I am smoking again now

[02:09] <agentzh> anyway, it completes without problem everyday.

[02:11] <agentzh> i was thinking a realclean might be necessary for the pad refactoring stuff, but it seems everything just works without doing that manually on feather. :)

[02:12] * agentzh has been suffering from DNS problems lately :(

[02:15] <agentzh> TimToady: are you also running some kind of autosmoking on your linux and windows machines?

[02:21] <dduncan> perl files should always end in .pm/.pl/.t/whatever, the same as perl 5

[02:21] <dduncan> using .p6 et al was ruled out a long time ago as being good

[02:22] <dduncan> rather, you put use p6-alpha in the file itself rather than use 5

[02:24] <Caelum> TimToady: nope

[02:24] <TimToady> if you msg me your email, I will attempt to send one

[02:25] <Caelum> that means I'll actually have to start working on something :)

[02:27] <TimToady> thinking about working on something is also considered working on something around here. :)

[02:32] <Caelum> TimToady: yes please :)

[02:33] <Limbic_Region> I am sure I have asked this before but do rules have natural ways of handling precedence and associativity or does one have to resort to wizardry like manual stratification and left-recursion elimination?

[02:49] <PerlJam> AFAIK anyway

[02:56] <Aankhen``> Er.

[02:56] <Aankhen``> The builtin session restore feature, on the other hand, doesn't work too well in case of crashes.

[02:57] <Aankhen``> Or at least that was my experience.

[02:59] <Aankhen``> Okay, I think it's time to run a smoke.

[04:09] <Caelum> what's the difference between $a = (1,2); and $a = [1,2]; ?

[04:11] <TimToady> *effectively

[04:11] <Caelum> cool

[04:19] <Caelum> the Capture.pod says you have to do $x = \@a; $$x.push("foo"); but $x.push("foo") works fine as well

[04:22] <TimToady> well, use on the left of . is scalar, so I'm not surprised that the extra $ is redundant

[04:26] <Aankhen``> 30m 52s for a smoke this time.

[04:26] <TimToady> probably find out the slowness of feather is caused by some ancient screen treasuring up a terabyte or so of output...

[08:26] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[08:33] <gaal> okay. the dying is not caused by bad Prelude.pm->Prelude.hs mangling, but rather by writing to %*INC at the end of the prelude load.

[08:34] <gaal> the easy fix is to declare %*INC safe, but I don't want to do that.

[08:34] <gaal> I don't understand yet why a preludePC does not trigger this problem.

[08:34] <gaal> apparently its merging of envs circumvents undeclared symbols

[08:35] <gaal> (I don't want to declare %*INC safe because this:

[10:43] <gaal> usually ghc doesn't compile via c at all

[10:46] <riffraff> I thought it used the gcc cpu-specific backends (I think they are called frontends in gcc, but anyway "the thing that spit out binary")

[10:47] <moritz> ghc6 debian package depends on gcc

[10:47] <gaal> you can compile -fvia-c, but normally you don't

[17:15] <spinclad> (OTOH if ® is alphabetic...)

[17:15] <TimToady> the above would have behaved differently if so

[17:17] <TimToady> oh yeah, evalbot doesn't do character classes...

[17:18] <moritz> so a regex match should set .pos on a string?

[17:19] <TimToady> heh, Ⓡ is considered alpha, but not ®

[17:19] <TimToady> yes, unless we decide that attaching .pos to a string is a violation of some principle or other

[17:20] <moritz> alright

[17:20] <TimToady> but it'd be nice to be able to continue one regex in a different regex like P5 can

[17:21] <TimToady> possibly .pos would have to be both per string and per thread

[17:21] <moritz> sounds... somehow scary ;)

[17:21] <spinclad> per handle... open a string for parsing, returns handle

[17:22] <TimToady> or generalize it into a marking facility, and pos is just one convention name for a mark

[17:28] <moritz> that's a bit weird anyway ;)

[17:28] <moritz> or perhaps I just didn't understand it ...

[17:29] <TimToady> maybe we could just lose the : after @@: as long as we have a space, basically say that a sigil with a space after it is a contextualizer listop

[19:58] <TimToady> was gonna install Fedora 7 this morning, but got sidetracked into revising slicing...

[19:59] <TimToady> forgot to eat too...

[20:00] <TimToady> anyway, here's the checkin log:

[20:00] <TimToady> Dropped : from all listop contextualizers, whether sigil and typename.

[20:00] <TimToady> The @@ contextualizer is now also named "slice".

[20:00] <TimToady> Consistent with that, we have regularized slice nomenclature:

[20:00] <TimToady> * A "slice" now always refers to the whole multidimensional subscript, or the list of lists corresponding to that.

[20:00] <TimToady> * We now try to avoid calling the individual sublists "slices".

[20:00] <TimToady> * The parameter to a subscript is *@@slice, not *@@slices.

[20:00] <TimToady> * The term "multislice" is now deemed redundant.

[20:01] <TimToady> so now basically we can write either

[20:02] <TimToady> for 1..3 X 1..2 -> $a, $b {...}

[20:02] <TimToady> or

[20:02] <TimToady> for @@ 1..3 X 1..2 -> [$a, $b] {...}

[20:04] <TimToady> and foo $ bar almost looks like Haskell...

[20:04] <TimToady> being equivalent to foo $(bar)

[20:17] <TimToady> you'd just end up with a hash containing 1=>4 and 2=>4

[20:17] <TimToady> maybe we'll end up with a set context though.  %% perhaps

[20:17] <mj41> :-)

[20:18] <moritz> what about user definable contexts?
