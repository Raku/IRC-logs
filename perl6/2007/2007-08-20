[13:27] <pmurias> fglock: is there anything in particular i could do?

[13:28] <fglock> pmurias: I'm trying to follow the plan at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/pugs/v6/docs/kp6-roadmap.pod.html

[13:28] <lambdabot> Title: kp6-roadmap

[13:29] <fglock> the next step could be to fix the Array and Hash implementations

[13:29] <fglock> in order to implement Signatures/Captures

[13:30] <fglock> the plan also needs work - there is no Milestone 4.2

[13:33] <fglock> 4.2 will depend on which extra functionality STD needs

[13:35] <pmurias> i'll try to do the Hash then

[13:38] <fglock> cool - there is some previous work from the pil-run implementation

[13:38] <masak> reuse++

[13:38] <fglock> but we don't need everything right now (slices, OO-keys)

[13:40] <masak> fglock: what's the goal of kp6?

[13:40] <fglock> masak: it's yet another Perl 6 compiler, but it is written in a subset of Perl 6

[13:41] <masak> what's "kinda" about it?

[13:41] <fglock> because the "real" Perl 6 compiler would be written in "full" Perl 6

[13:41] <masak> ah, ok

[13:41] <fglock> the "kinda" is about the source code

[13:42] <masak> doesn't sound like a real disadvantage to me, that it's being written in a subset

[13:42] <masak> that might be good for portability, for example

[13:44] *** zamolxes joined
[13:47] <fglock> yes, that's one advantage; the disadvantages are that we have to implement our own tools (Pugs reuses a lot from Haskell and Perl 5), and it's slow (the Parrot compiler should be much faster)

[13:47] <masak> "nod"

[13:47] <masak> *nod*, even

[13:47] <fglock> but it's fun :)

[13:48] *** jhorwitz joined
[13:48] *** rindolf joined
[13:49] <pmurias> using mp6 instead of full p6 hinders portability in a way

[13:49] <pmurias> as writing a backend in mp6 is way more work then it would in full p6

[13:50] <masak> pmurias: why?

[13:51] <masak> or rather, does that not presuppose the existence of a full p6 compiler?

[13:55] <pmurias> i mean that mp6 might be an advantage over for example pir, but when kp6 is ready enough i don't think one would gain much by not writing it in itself

[13:56] *** awwaiid joined
[13:56] <pmurias> it's not as if i had a finished p6 compiler hidden somewhere ;)

[13:57] <masak> I hope not ;)

[13:58] <fglock> pmurias: that's the idea; rewriting kp6 in itself == writing Perl 6 in Perl 6

[13:59] <masak> fglock: so the goal of kp6 is to converge towards a full p6 compiler, written in itself?

[14:00] <pmurias> fglock: i know

[14:00] <pmurias> masak: yes

[14:01] * masak ponders that

[14:02] <fglock> hmm - I'd better remember the reason why we are not using pugs to write the compiler

[14:03] *** amnesiac joined
[14:04] *** DarkWolf84 joined
[14:05] <fglock> I think it's because perl5 is just easier to hack with

[14:18] <fglock> i'm not much into sugar functions

[14:25] <fglock> pmurias: it looks like Moose

[14:29] <fglock> i think the most cryptic part is " sugar {  %{ $_[0] }, _value => {}, } ", and the sugar doesn't help there

[16:17] * moritz_ wonders if the supplemental services like evalbot, irc logging etc. should go into a separate svn repository

[16:17] <moritz_> to keep the pugs repo a bit cleaner

[16:18] <moritz_> on the other hand the overhead of maintaining to svn repos might be overkill

[16:20] <diakopter> moritz_: while you're at it, I'd like to see separate trunk/branches(/tags?) for the various implementations - pugs, mp6/kp6, etc.  And even a separate one for the test suite (building pugs' CPAN distribution would either include it or refer to a separate distribution)...  but all of that can still be in the same repo - just in different dirs.  We can do /pugs/* -> /projects/trunk/pugs/* redirecting for the old links.... yes I know it's

[16:20] <diakopter> ... suggestion. :(

[16:21] <diakopter> oops, /projects/pugs/trunk/* I meant... 

[16:21] <masak> diakopter: that sounds like a really good idea

[16:22] <diakopter> masak: there are detriments, though

[16:22] <moritz_> diakopter: you are thinking of a perl 6 repo, not a pugs one ;-)

[16:22] <diakopter> moritz_: yeah :/

[16:22] <moritz_> I don't object, but you should consult audreyt and TimToady at least ;-)

[16:22] <masak> pugs practically is a perl 6 repo...

[16:23] <masak> s/pugs/the pugs repo/

[16:23] <diakopter> I'm certainly not wholeheartedly recommending it, as I know it would cause grief

[16:23] <masak> it would certainly cause disorientation at least

[16:23] <diakopter> but I thought I'd bring it up since you mentioned splitting some out at all.

[16:23] *** kanru left
[16:23] <masak> but it might be good long-term

[16:24] <diakopter> honestly I'd kinda like to "start over" with all the non-haskell svn.pugscode.org/pugs/* stuff... in either one new repo or a bunch of new repos...

[16:25] <masak> why?

[16:25] <diakopter> masak: purely in case audreyt can't be reached for a decision on pugs proper

[16:26] *** Blwood joined
[16:27] <masak> hm

[16:27] <diakopter> masak: I mean, the repo could be cloned to retain history.

[16:27] <masak> that's what svn does, retain history

[16:27] <diakopter> bbiab

[16:27] <diakopter> er, yeah

[16:30] <masak> did not mean to score a cheap rethoric point, I just don't really understand the exact purpose

[16:31] *** weinig_ joined
[16:31] <masak> (and I sincerely hope that audreyt can be reached for a decision on pugs proper for all foreseeable future)

[16:33] *** barney joined
[16:34] <diakopter> I meant that it could be forked, (tentatively/temporarily) to leave both options open for her.

[16:34] <masak> which two options?

[16:35] <masak> restructured repo vs old repo?

[16:35] <diakopter> keeping pugs proper in the existing repo/url/structure or moving it to some new structure/url (whether in the same (actually "forked") or its own repo).

[16:37] <masak> was audreyt almost coming back to pugs development for a while, and then disappeared again? I seem to recall her talking briefly about relenging, but haven't seen her since

[16:38] <diakopter> I haven't heard much recently.  obra: ping?

[16:38] <masak> there certainly are benefits to keeping all activity in one repo, as now

[16:40] <diakopter> definitely

[16:40] *** JarJarBi1ks is now known as JarJarBinks

[16:41] <masak> this channel is one. would perl 6 activity split into many projects, channel activity might split, too

[16:41] *** thoughtpolice joined
[16:41] <diakopter> I'd hope not.  I'd think moritz_++ 's new AIO bot would keep it close :)

[16:42] <masak> yes, most likely :)

[16:42] <masak> depends how independant the other projects got, I guess

[16:42] <diakopter> sharing a virtual bazaar is healthly for competitors and cooperators. :)

[16:43] * masak is desperatly waiting for 6.28.0

[16:43] <diakopter> the question is whether/when would parrot/nqp and parrot/perl6 discussion migrate over here.....

[16:43] <masak> heh

[16:43] <moritz_> somehow I doubt that they will

[16:44] <moritz_> they have stricter coding styles, stricter access controll (less commiters)...

[16:44] <moritz_> somehow I think they feel safer in their own repository

[16:44] <diakopter> I didn't mean repository

[16:44] <diakopter> I meant the channel

[16:44] <moritz_> ah, ok

[16:45] <moritz_> @seen pmichaud

[16:45] <lambdabot> I haven't seen pmichaud.

[16:45] *** iblechbot left
[16:45] <moritz_> seen pmichaud

[16:45] <buubot> moritz_: Sorry, I haven't seen pmichaud

[16:45] <masak> diakopter: it might be that, to the extent that they intersect, the discussions have already migrated

[16:45] <masak> in which direction I'm not sure, probably both

[16:45] <diakopter> TimToady and pmichaud routinely have syntax/grammar discussions on #parrot the past coupla months

[17:28] <Muixirt> in what charcter encoding is perl souce code written in?

[17:28] <moritz_> are you talking about perl6?

[17:28] <Muixirt> yes

[17:28] <moritz_> that assumes utf8

[17:29] <Muixirt> does the language itself use characters that arent ascii?

[17:30] *** justatheory left
[17:30] *** sri__ left
[17:30] *** sri_ joined
[17:30] <moritz_> yes

[17:31] *** justatheory_ joined
[17:31] <moritz_> for example «...» (that can be written as <<...>> as well)

[17:31] <wolverian> though that is latin1

[17:31] <moritz_> ?eval «foo bar baz».perl

[17:31] <wolverian> I think the core language still doesn't require any characters outside the latin1 set

[17:31] <moritz_> even latin1 is not ascii

[17:31] <wolverian> sure

[17:31] *** kjwcode joined
[17:32] <moritz_> and previously the Yen sign was a valid operator...

[18:23] <Pat____> cananyone explain the previous ?

[18:23] <Pat____> why is my result different than wolverian's ?

[18:23] <wolverian> hm

[18:24] <Pat____> even though the precendence of the assignement should be lower ...

[18:24] *** fglock left
[18:25] <Pat____> actually it is not a perl6 thingy ... it is a perl thingy that bit us at work .. i just wanted to make sure perl6 behaves the same way

[18:29] <pugsbot_r17185> \2

[18:30] <masak> seems there is only one way to parse it, precedance-wise

[18:30] <masak> s/da/de/

[18:30] <Pat____> I tried figuring out the precedence rule but could not ...

[18:31] <masak> ?eval 2 !! 3

[18:31] <pugsbot_r17185> Error: ␤Unexpected "!!"␤expecting operator

[18:31] <masak> exactly.

[18:31] <masak> I don't understand how it goes wrong

[18:33] <wolverian> it compiles to

[18:33] <wolverian> (1 ?? $a=2 !! $a) = 3

[18:33] <masak> aaah

[18:33] <wolverian> i.e. $a = 2 = 3

[18:33] <wolverian> same thing in perl5 

[18:33] <masak> lvalues!

[18:34] <masak> ($a = 2) = 3

[18:34] <wolverian> we have constant folding too, so it's actually directly compiled to $a=2=3

[18:34] <wolverian> in perl5 anyway

[18:34] <wolverian> yar, that.

[18:34] *** dduncan joined
[18:34] <masak> will we ever get constant folding that reomves the 2? :)

[18:35] <Pat____> :-)

[18:35] <Pat____> who thanks guys

[18:35] <Pat____> i mean whoa ... 

[18:35] <Pat____> i could not have guessed on my own

[18:36] <masak> trust the #perl6 team to solve all your perl 5 questions :)

[18:36] <wolverian> Pat____, you can play with perl -MO=Deparse -e'....' , and with B::Deparse's various options to make the output make more sense

[18:36] <wolverian> it wasn't particularly useful in this instance, until I replaced the 1 with a variable.

[18:37] <Pat____> masak heheheh I thought this would do the trick ...

[18:37] <Pat____> thanks wolverian I'll sure do that next time

[18:37] *** DarkWolf84 left
[18:38] *** DarkWolf84 joined
[18:39] <Pat____> the output is at least helpful enough to know where perl was putting the implicit parens ...

[18:45] <Pat____> ok so while I am here

[18:45] <Pat____> how is perl 6 coming along ?

[18:45] <masak> :)

[18:45] <Pat____> slowly but steadily ?

[18:45] <wolverian> it's converging

[18:46] <masak> \lim t->\infty perl6 = christmas

[18:46] <Pat____> hehhehe

[18:46] <Pat____> then it'll be constant chrismas

[18:48] <wolverian> I hope we don't need to wait infinitely...

[18:48] <[particle]> don't worry, we'll let you unwrap some presents on christmas eve :)

[18:49] <masak> pugs has at least brought christmas this side of infinity...

[18:49] <wolverian> what's on the other side of infinity?

[18:50] * pmurias dosn't think constant christmas would be a good thing

[18:50] <[particle]> Pat____: the behavior is documented under Conditional Operator section of perlop

[18:51] <masak> wolverian: new years eve

[18:51] <[particle]> (thanks goes to pmichaud on #parrot for that reference)

[18:51] *** iblechbot joined
[18:51] <Pat____> thanks [particle] hehhe and to think i could have gotten an rtfm as an answer :-)

[18:52] <[particle]> seems you're not the first deranged programmer to try that :P

[18:52] <masak> Pat____: RTFM is not as -O fun as finding the answer :)

[18:53] <PerlJam> Pat____: btw, the general rule is "if you're using assignment in the branches of the ternary op, you're doing something wrong"

[18:54] <masak> heh

[18:54] <wolverian> true :)

[18:54] <Pat____> perlbot are there other reasons beside the behaviour that bit me in the butt ?

[18:54] <Pat____> oopps i meant PerlJam :-)

[18:55] <Pat____> not to imply that you are a perlbot ... or that being a perlbot is a pejorative term :-P

[18:55] <PerlJam> Pat____: There's the aesthetics of it.  The abuse of the ternary op.  And, of course, precedence.
