[00:17] <nowhere_man> there has been no list summaries for a long time, where to get any news about Perl 6?

[00:18] <nowhere_man> like the current roadmap or how far it is from a release

[00:21] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 17236 - Pugs - Trac

[00:22] <TimToady> nobody volunteered to summarize, so mostly you just have to follow along on the mailing lists and irc if you're interested

[00:23] <TimToady> the weekly phonecall minutes still show up, posted by chromatic, but we don't discuss everything there

[00:23] <nowhere_man> so how far is Perl 6 from a release?

[00:25] <TimToady> depends on how much help we get

[00:25] <TimToady> which is impossible to predict

[00:25] <justatheory_> iow, christmas

[00:26] *** justatheory_ is now known as justatheory

[00:27] <TimToady> if a billionaire hired about 300 of us to work on it fulltime, we could probably have it done by this Christmas

[00:27] <TimToady> in the absence of that, we're all just working on it in our copious free time

[00:27] <justatheory> for some other christmas. ;-P

[00:28] * justatheory suspects that there might be a mythical man month problem in TimToady's "300 of us" estimate.

[00:28] <TimToady> justatheary also suspects that the project management has been promoted to the level of its incompetence.  :)

[00:29] <TimToady> s:2nd/a/o/

[00:29] <justatheory> heh

[00:30] <TimToady> fortunately, I'm just good enough at management to delegate *all* the management to others. :)

[01:41] <diakopter> nowhere_man: would you like to help out?

[01:49] <nowhere_man> I kind of dropped out of Perl after having used it quite much, but most of what I read about Perl 6 makes me want to try it

[01:49] <nowhere_man> my various attempts with Pugs weren't that successful

[01:50] <nowhere_man> I managed to get errors with tutorial code, I remember

[01:50] <nowhere_man> not once only

[01:51] <diakopter> nowhere_man: yes; pugs  was a [very quickly] moving target for the documentation and tutorials for quite a while.  Probably not many of them have caught up, even after its cryogenic for the past 1/2 year.

[02:04] <nowhere_man> is there any tutorial/implementation couple I could try by now?

[02:08] <diakopter> hm

[02:11] <diakopter> http://www.pair.com/~comdog/Talks/LearningPerl6-NPW2007.pdf

[02:12] <diakopter> that's quite recent

[02:12] <diakopter> should work with today-pugs.

[02:12] <diakopter> do you have a recent pugs built?

[02:14] <diakopter> nowhere_man: http://run.pugscode.org/ seems to be up and running (you can use it for much of those slides)

[05:04] <nowhere_man> how do junctions work? is there any design document on their implementation?

[05:06] <nowhere_man> is it the compiler that "flattens" any expression with a junction? e.g. make « $num == any <1 2> » be « $num == 1 or $num == 2 »

[05:52] <lambdabot> Title: S03

[05:52] *** Casan_ left
[05:52] <TimToady> nowhere_man: no, it's a run-time determination based on the fact that the Junction type doesn't match most other types, so it ends up "autothreading"; in addition to S03 see also S09:932

[05:53] <TimToady> basically, it'll never dispatch a Junction to a routine that isn't expecting one.

[05:53] <TimToady> that includes things like ==

[05:53] <lambdabot> Title: S09

[05:54] <TimToady> eventually it all bubbles up to a boolean context and then the logic happens

[06:08] <diakopter> I'm wondering whether any but the most trivial of Perl6 programs (as compiled-to-disk) won't need to embed (or link to) a perl6 implementation

[06:09] <diakopter> karma lwall

[06:09] <diakopter> @karma lwall

[06:09] <lambdabot> lwall has a karma of 10

[06:09] <justatheory> I guess it doesn't pick up svnbot's ++s

[06:09] <diakopter> @karma lwall

[06:09] <lambdabot> lwall has a karma of 11

[06:10] <lambdabot> lwall has a karma of 14

[06:10] <diakopter> I think when lambdabot is restarted, it loses its memory

[06:11] <thoughtpolice> diakopter: no it keeps that sort of info with it

[06:11] <thoughtpolice> inside a State/ directory

[06:11] <thoughtpolice> same with stuff like @where and whatnot

[06:11] <kane__> lwall therefor is just a lazy committer, or collects a lot of -- for other behaviour

[06:11] <kane__> only explenation :)

[06:11] <diakopter> and usually it doesn't have to be restarted, since its hs runtime system can swap out any plugins without restarting.  it only restarted b/c of a power failure, according to #haskell

[15:06] <diakopter> is pugscode.org DNS still flapping?

[15:07] <TimToady> dunno, just did an svn up okay

[15:09] <diakopter> TimToady: do you ever use cygwin(/MinGW) while booted to Windows?

[15:09] <TimToady> sure

[15:09] <TimToady> it has...issues...

[15:10] <TimToady> my main gripe about cygwin is the "Unicode, what's that?" attitude

[15:13] <diakopter> hmm.  its gcc was having trouble finding perl's EXTERN.h yesterday, but now I don't remember which XS'd module cpan was trying to build.

[15:13] *** cognominal_ left
[15:18] <diakopter> I did (re)discover a way (for me) to easily swap between different $PATH setups/precendences - by prepending $PATH with an override dir, which is itself a symlink to zero or one of several path-override dirs, which themselves contain symlinks to the proper set of images I want the shell to find at different times.  Switching configs is as simple as making aliases to commands that change which override dir the master link points to.  <si

[15:18] *** cognominal_ joined
[15:18] <diakopter> ... that was discovered 30 years ago or something.  and there are probably recommendeder and officialer ways, but I had fun figuring it out.

[15:20] *** andara left
[15:20] *** DarkWolf84 joined
[15:21] <diakopter> the reason I needed something like that is that the installed locations of some sets of these images don't (always) correspond to being in one particular bin/.  Of course, --prefix could have been used to get them into further-stratified precedence levels, but this is frankly easier.  Anyway, enough OT spewing from me for this hour.

[18:16] <nowhere_man> so how could I get the max of a range, by using min, just to understand?

[18:17] <nowhere_man> my @a=1..9

[18:17] <nowhere_man> min @a, :by(gt)

[18:17] <nowhere_man> didn't work

[18:19] <TimToady> range objects aren't implemented in pugs yet

[18:20] *** kane_ joined
[18:20] <TimToady> and "by" wouldn't mean that anyway.  "by" is the increment

[18:21] <TimToady> the min listop will eventually take a comparator just like sort, but that is also not implemented

[18:21] <nowhere_man> TimToady: what is the increment in the context of min?

[18:22] <kjwcode> Anyone know how to get around the error above?  I'm installing a more up-to-date XCode, but I don't know if that's going to do the trick.

[18:23] <diakopter> kjwcode: what version of gcc do you have?

[18:24] <kjwcode> diakopter: Using 4.0.1, Apple build 5367.

[18:24] <diakopter> you actually must use the Apple 4.0.1 one, if I recall.

[18:24] <diakopter> ok

[18:24] <diakopter> is this a new checkout?

[18:24] <kjwcode> Yup, r17238.

[18:24] <diakopter> which version of ghc?

[18:25] *** kane_ joined
[18:25] <kjwcode> ghc 6.6.1 -- Audrey's package.

[18:25] <diakopter> hrm

[18:25] <diakopter> (and you're sure it's actually using that particular ghc?)

[18:25] <TimToady> okay, I see that it's going to be confusing to have an argument to min called "by".

[18:26] <kjwcode> It's the only ghc on the system.  The error is actually a gcc error, IIRC.

[18:27] <diakopter> kjwcode: I'm not sure why it's trying to build Universal images.  mine builds intel only

[18:28] <kjwcode> Weird.  I'm almost sure I ran into this last time I built from source, but that was too long ago to remember what I did.

[18:28] <kjwcode> I'm sure I'll figure it out.  :)

[18:44] <kjwcode> Figured it out...  Don't use ActivePerl to run Makefile.PL.  The build system seems to try to build Pugs using some of the settings of Perl, and that causes the problem (ActivePerl is universal).  MacPorts Perl appears to work.

[18:46] <moritz_> kjwcode: maybe you could add a hint to INSTALL

[20:28] <moritz_> good

[20:28] * moritz_ caresses pugsbot ;)

[20:28] <fridim> so,  my @vows is a reference to a NEW list (or array, I don't know) created when I wrote %hash<c a> ?

[20:30] <moritz_> no, if it was a ref the output would be a => 3

[20:30] <moritz_> the assignment @vows[1]=3doesn't affect %hash

[20:31] <DarkWolf84> ref?

[20:31] <DarkWolf84> I think it was just copy

[20:31] <moritz_> there are no refs in p6 ;)

[20:31] <moritz_> and yes, it's a (shallow) copy
