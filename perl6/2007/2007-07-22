[04:03] <diotalevi> In languages with continuations, is it common to package a continuation with an exception to make a "work unit" re-doable? Consider the case of soft-failure in the face of network connections.

[16:11] *** [particle1 is now known as [particle]

[16:12] <thoughtpolice> [particle]: cool.

[16:12] <thoughtpolice> i have a box sitting around and i've been bored the past few days so I figure i'll do something with it.

[16:12] <[particle]> it runs sun lint there, too (make sunlint or make lint iirc)

[16:12] <lambdabot> [particle]: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[16:12] <thoughtpolice> [particle]: it has no internet but i could just pull the smoke.html and send it from say this box right?

[16:13] <[particle]> thoughtpolice++ # you can usually find andy on irc.perl.org#parrot  to help if you need

[16:13] <[particle]> yep

[16:13] <thoughtpolice> [particle]: what's the util in the source tree for that

[16:13] <thoughtpolice> tools/util/smokeserv-client.pl ?

[16:13] <[particle]> tools/utils/smokeserv-client.pl iirc

[16:13] <[particle]> you can verify by examining the 'smoke' target in the makefile

[16:14] <thoughtpolice> yeah. i'll find a usb stick lying around (hell, i could use my psp :>) and get the source there and the smoke's back

[16:15] <[particle]> hurrah for sneakernet!

[16:15] <thoughtpolice> i can't test svn though, only releases (no internet,) if I get connections for it soon it'll be a small fileserver but i could smoke the latest repo :)

[16:16] <thoughtpolice> i'll try to do that sometime now that i think of it. :)

[17:37] *** franck____ left
[17:39] <TimToady> @tell pmurias though for any extensive use of a new metaclass I'd just replace "class" with a different keyword.  You can view the "role" declaration that way, for instance.

[17:41] *** amnesiac joined
[17:42] <TimToady> @tell pmurias though now that I think on it, it's probably "is HOW(new Bar)" since .HOW is pointing to an instance of the metaclass.

[19:13] <_moritz_> but starting from tomorrow I have $work to do, so nearly no time for hacking ;(

[19:15] <spinclad> riffraff: audreyt recently upgraded the requirement to 6.6.1

[19:17] * pmurias will be away on camp for the next 12 days

[19:18] <spinclad> on debian etch we've either upgraded to testing's ghc or backported; the backport may get submitted to backports.org...

[19:19] <_moritz_> though you can't install ghc's binaries from lenny without upgrading, because it wants a new glibc or something

[19:22] <pmurias> i'll only do c++ for that period :(

[19:22] <spinclad> upgrading glibc at least, right.  i've done that and not seen any instability, though my usage pattern is limited.

[19:22] <Patterner> to 2.6?

[19:22] <_moritz_> I was too scared, I admit ;)

[19:23] <Patterner> 2.6 works for me

[19:23] <spinclad> and glibc brought in incompatible kernel headers, which worries me some.

[19:24] <spinclad> (expect i should worry more, if i built my own kernels as i should)

[23:51] <TimToady> cognominal_: immutable types are just values, like numbers.  You can't assign to them.

[23:51] <TimToady> mutable types are like variables or containers that can change their value

[23:52] <TimToady> So you can have a value like a set--in set theory every possible collection is a different set

[23:52] <TimToady> if you have a set variable, it changes which set it holds every time you modify it.
