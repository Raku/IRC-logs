[00:22] <Limbic_Region> salutations

[00:22] <moritz> hi Limbic_Region ;)

[00:22] <Limbic_Region> so has audreyt surfaced or is she still mostly away?

[00:23] <moritz> @seen audreyt 

[00:23] <Limbic_Region> ?seen audreyt

[00:23] <Limbic_Region> hrm

[00:23] <moritz> perlbot: seen audreyt

[00:23] <jabbot> moritz: audreyt was seen 99 days 11 hours 13 minutes 38 seconds ago

[00:24] <moritz> I don't quite believe jabbot,a nd I'm wondering why lambdabot isn't responding, but she doesn't seem to be too active

[00:26] <Limbic_Region> I was just wondering if she was going to be at YAPC and if she was doing the hackathon(s)

[00:27] <jjore-w> LR, are you?

[00:27] <jjore-w> I am.

[00:27] * jjore-w would be pretty happy to finally meet you.

[00:28] *** pjcj joined
[00:31] <Limbic_Region> sorry jjore-w - was AFK

[00:31] <Limbic_Region> Unfortunately no

[00:32] <Limbic_Region> Work is nuts at the moment

[00:32] <moritz> are you talking about YAPC::Europe, or is there another soon?

[00:32] <Limbic_Region> YAPC NA is in 2 weeks AFAIK

[00:33] <Limbic_Region> http://use.perl.org/yapc/07/06/11/0915206.shtml

[00:33] <Limbic_Region> jjore-w - will this be your first perl conference?

[00:34] <moritz> what's wrong with lambdabot? no URL titles :(

[00:36] <Limbic_Region> @tell moritz I have no idea

[00:36] <TimToady> it's resting

[00:36] <Limbic_Region> if we had a chan op we could kick and re-invite and see if that had any affect

[00:37] <shachaf> moritz: Lambdabot is dead, you can use lambdabot2 for now.

[00:37] <TimToady> when can we have a lambdabot6 that ignores initial @?

[00:39] <moritz> shachaf: it's not about using it or not, but about reacting on m/^\@/ and URLs

[00:39] <moritz> shachaf: but thanks anyway ;)

[00:45] <Limbic_Region> @seen audreyt

[00:45] <lambdabot2> audreyt is in #perl6 and #haskell. I don't know when audreyt last spoke.

[00:45] <Limbic_Region> yay

[00:45] <Limbic_Region> thanks shachaf

[00:47] <moritz> shachaf++

[00:47] <shachaf> moritz: Thank sorear.

[00:47] <moritz> sorear++ # ;-)

[00:48] <sorear> :)

[00:48] <shachaf> moritz: This karma probably won't apply anyway when the real lambdabot comes back. :-)

[00:48] <moritz> shachaf: perlbot still records karma ;)

[00:48] <moritz> perlbot: karma sorear

[00:48] <jabbot> moritz: sorear has karma of 1

[00:48] <perlbot> Karma for sorear: 1

[00:49] <sorear> lambdabot2 is a real lambdabot, btw.  it normally tends the backwater channels like #haskell.se

[00:50] <sorear> you hear about lambdabot because she's the one minding popular channels

[00:50] <moritz> lambdabot is a she? actually I never thought about that before ;)

[00:51] *** nipotaway is now known as nipotan

[00:51] <sorear> yeah.  documented as such

[00:51] <shachaf> @where lambdabot

[00:51] <lambdabot2> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html

[00:51] <TimToady> lambda ends with an 'a', which is usually feminine in Indo-European...

[00:51] <shachaf> sorear: And they keep the same state, it seems (karma, @where, etc.)

[00:51] <moritz> "It operates as a command line tool[...]"

[00:52] <sorear> @listservers

[00:52] <lambdabot2> freenode

[00:52] <moritz> that's not "she operates"...

[00:52] <sorear> evidently they aren't the same process...

[00:52] <shachaf> moritz: Just look at the picture.

[00:53] <TimToady> I often called my kids "it" when they were young:  "It wants a popsicle."

[00:53] * sorear hacked multiserver support into lambdabot back in Jan; suprisingly this feature has never been used.

[14:31] <[particle]> pugs needs a dye job. her roots are showing.

[14:31] <moritz> pugs needs a working parrot backend ;)

[14:32] <PerlJam> moritz: so ... when will you have that completed?  ;)

[14:32] <moritz> PerlJam: first I have to learn a bit more haskell :(

[14:32] <[particle]> funny, it's conference season, but nobody on pugs has mentioned that as a goal. i would have expected it.

[14:32] *** REPLeffect joined
[14:32] <[particle]> parrot is >< *this close* to running Test.pm

[14:32] <moritz> PerlJam: yesterday I visited a haskell tutorial at debconf7 - I'm serious about pugs ;)

[14:33] <PerlJam> [particle]: interest in pugs has waned?

[14:33] <[particle]> maybe. interest in a parrot back end for pugs has waned.

[14:33] <moritz> with audreyt being absent most of the time the driving force is missing

[14:33] <PerlJam> yeah, haskell is more fun than parrot.

[14:34] <[particle]> well, i predict soon you'll be writing perl 6 in perl 6 on parrot.

[14:34] <[particle]> perl 6 is more fun than haskell

[14:34] <PerlJam> moritz: it's not just audreyt but the cloud of people that come with her that matters.  Enough of the cloud is absent.

[14:34] <moritz> PerlJam: right :(

[14:35] <[particle]> well, there's plenty to be done in the pugs repo now, than anyone can do.

[14:35] <PerlJam> [particle]: I've made the same prediction for a couple of months now.  (Where "soon" was "by OScon" or so)

[14:37] <[particle]> pj: that's our goal. and i think the perl6/win32 bug has been squashed with chromatic's latest patch :)

[14:38] <PerlJam> chromatic++ 

[14:38] <PerlJam> He's been doing some not-very-fun-but-very-necessary work lately.

[14:39] <[particle]> yes, that's what pugs needs too... and parrot perl6 will be driving it soon

[14:39] <[particle]> specifically, the test suite needs refactoring

[14:40] <moritz> [particle]: of what kind?

[14:40] <moritz> I hear that all the time, but never something more specific

[14:40] <[particle]> to make sure it'll run on multiple implementations

[14:41] * moritz is willing to do some work on the p6 test suite

[14:41] <[particle]> i expect there's some pugs-specific stuff that has crept into it

[14:41] <[particle]> it's hard to test without a second implementation, though

[14:41] <moritz> [particle]: somebody recently subsituted many 'pugs' calls to '$^INTERPRETER' or whatever the variable is called theses days

[14:42] <moritz> and I don't think there are any vv()'s in the test suite ;)

[14:43] <moritz> of course all the eval() for parse errors are pugs specific

[14:44] <moritz> perhaps when BEGIN-Blocks work we should move all plan $n; to BEGIN blocks?

[14:44] <moritz> but that wouldn't help very much

[14:44] <[particle]> need to add pugs-specific todo info

[14:45] <moritz> is that specced?

[14:45] <moritz> :todo<pugs> or something?

[14:45] <[particle]> yes, it is

[14:45] <moritz> wow

[14:45] <moritz> where?

[14:45] <[particle]> lemme check the docs...

[14:46] <[particle]> S02:220

[14:46] <moritz> [particle]++

[14:47] <[particle]> that will help us a lot

[14:47] <[particle]> and also, making sure every test has a smartlink

[14:49] <moritz> I did some cleanup some time ago, but it's a long, tedious task ;)

[14:49] <moritz> anyway, gotto go now

[14:49] <moritz> bye&

[14:49] <REPLeffect> moritz: You said something about "audreyt being absent most of the time" ...

[14:49] <REPLeffect> Is something going on that I didn't hear about?

[14:50] <moritz> REPLeffect: Real Life I guess :(

[14:50] <moritz> now gone for real &

[14:50] <[particle]> moritz: yes, long, tedious, and very welcome, thanks!

[14:50] <REPLeffect> OK, I was hoping it wasn't medical problems again.

[15:00] <thoughtpolice> hm. how far is the parrot backend from working? i take it pretty far?

[15:00] <[particle]> it's just bitrot

[15:00] <[particle]> some api changes

[15:00] <thoughtpolice> hm. i'd be real interested in the haskell'ing part but I really need to familiarize myself with the source layout more

[15:01] <thoughtpolice> i oft wish there was a 'cscope for haskell.' :(

[15:01] <[particle]> i'm not at all familiar with the interface, but if pointed to it, i could help somebody get it fixed

[15:02] <thoughtpolice> hm. i might take you up on that offer. :)

[15:05] *** lisppaste3 joined

[15:54] <gaal> whoa, a laziness of lambdabots

[15:55] <gaal> (and that isn't even the hit I was aiming for)

[15:56] <thoughtpolice> gaal: since hasktags can be pretty useful (especially on large source tree's,) has anybody suggested using it to build an index that people could use for a reference through the source?

[16:13] <gaal> there's haddoc that does documentation and i think also source xreffing

[16:14] <thoughtpolice> i saw the haddock-style comments through the source; is it hosted anywhere?

[16:14] <thoughtpolice> xref's would probably be better though

[16:15] <gaal> thoughtpolice: also fwiw, with vim, you can do "grep -r ruleSubName src" and then use quickfix (:cc, :cn, :cl...) for navigation

[16:15] <gaal> (i actually set the grep command to be recursive. newer vims even have an internal vimgrep; and some people prefer ack to grep.)

[16:17] <thoughtpolice> i'm an emacs man myself. :)

[16:17] <REPLeffect> gaal: Did you mean awk, or is there an ack tool I'm not aware of? 

[16:17] <[particle]> cpan App::Ack

[16:19] <PerlJam> Anyone who has used ack, prefers it to grep  :)

[16:20] <PerlJam> (except for exceedingly simple tasks)

[16:20] <REPLeffect> interesting.  I've never heard of it (and I use grep all the time)

[16:20] <gaal> thoughtpolice: "make haddock"

[16:23] <thoughtpolice> gaal: ah. :p

[16:24] <gaal> thoughtpolice: would be great to actually have that genned and put online; perhaps we could do that once trac is up again. but nobody seems to possess the tuits for that...

[16:25] <thoughtpolice> gaal: haddock docs or hasktags?

[16:25] <thoughtpolice> i could write a quick script to get a full hasktags generated index (with formatting since apparently hasktags doesn't mind it much itself)

[16:26] <REPLeffect> Hm.  After reading the ack docs, I suspect I will continue to use a find/grep combo

[16:26] <[particle]> what's it missing?

[16:26] <[particle]> i'm mostly done with adding -A -B -C to ack (search with context)

[16:27] <REPLeffect> The inability to grep files it doesn't know the type of.

[16:27] <thoughtpolice> you could just set a cron to update it like every 20 minutes or so. if you're interested gaal it wouldn't be much trouble at all; with a little time I expect I could get the generated list to contain links to the source location.

[16:27] <[particle]> the latest dev release adds --text

[16:27] <gaal> thoughtpolice: haddock, and even hoogle .hoo files while we're at it :-)

[16:27] <[particle]> and --skipped (to grep files it usually skips)

[16:28] <gaal> thoughtpolice: that would be awesome! host it on feather?

[16:28] <[particle]> and it has --all to search all files (but not normally skipped ones)

[16:28] <gaal> thoughtpolice++

[16:28] <thoughtpolice> gaal: sure.

[16:28] <REPLeffect> (like the RCS/CVS, etc?)

[16:29] <[particle]> REPLeffect: you should be able to ack --all --skipped foo and search *all* files

[16:29] <thoughtpolice> speaking of feather who would I contact to get an account there?

[16:29] <REPLeffect> interesting.  Might be worth a look then.

[16:29] <REPLeffect> What's the main advantage of ack?

[16:29] <[particle]> it's great for svn working copies

[16:29] <[particle]> and it works on windows

[16:29] <thoughtpolice> gaal: if I put it on feather I could also might as well have my dir contain the haddock docs as well. I could talk to the admin about setting me up a cron for that.

[16:30] <REPLeffect> grep works on Windows for me (cygwin)

[16:30] <[particle]> REPLeffect: and it's perl, so if you want to add something, go ahead.

[16:30] * gaal is googling for juerd's email...

[16:30] <[particle]> and i'm a committer, and andy lester created it.

[16:30] <[particle]> [email@hidden.address]
[16:30] <REPLeffect> real friends don't let friends use Windows without cygwin :-)

[16:30] * [particle] hateses cygwin

[16:30] <thoughtpolice> [particle]: thanks. :)

[16:31] <thoughtpolice> gaal: i'll email juerd about an account and see if cron is possible for hasktags generated index (and even haddock too while we're at it since it wouldn't be much more trouble.)

[16:31] <gaal> thoughtpolice: he asks that you email him the request with your real name

[16:31] <thoughtpolice> gaal: np

[16:32] <gaal> thoughtpolice: re: cron, easy as pie, just put it in your own crontab (crontab -e)

[16:32] <thoughtpolice> ah. nice. :)

[16:33] <gaal> does one of the bots have a "what's that moose's email?" feature?

[16:33] <[particle]> juerd?

[16:33] <[particle]> purl handles that on #parrot

[16:33] <thoughtpolice> i dunno if lambdabot has specifically email, but you could use ?where for that

[16:33] <gaal> ?where carmen sandiego

[16:33] <lambdabot> I know nothing about carmen.

[16:33] <lambdabot2> I know nothing about carmen.

[16:36] <thoughtpolice> gaal: email sent.

[16:36] <gaal> cool

[16:36] <thoughtpolice> :) hopefull by the end of the weekend we can have some haddock and hasktags online. :)

[16:37] <thoughtpolice> if life doesn't interfere

[16:37] <thoughtpolice> which could pose a problem.

[16:37] *** justatheory joined
[16:37] <gaal> just aim for positive interference

[16:38] <thoughtpolice> i'll keep it in mind.

[16:39] <Juerd> [particle]: pong

[16:40] <[particle]> Juerd: just testing the bots to see if they'd provide your email address

[16:40] <[particle]> thoughtpolice is looking for a feather account

[16:40] <Juerd> As long as he lets feather users think what they want, he can get one :)

[16:40] <[particle]> i'll put him on notice :)

[16:41] <gaal> that's an interesting view, citizen

[16:41] <SamB> maybe thoughtpolice is just making sure people do think ;-)

[16:42] <gaal> i'm not sure the laws of physics allow that, actually

[16:42] <SamB> why do you have two lambdabots here?

[16:43] <gaal> isn't there a symmetry associated with stupidity?

[16:43] <SamB> or, rather, two of the same lambdabot?

[16:43] <Juerd> gaal: What are the penalties for breaking that law?

[16:43] <[particle]> o/' think! think. think about what you're trying to do to me. o/`

[16:43] <gaal> is lambdabot in Eq?

[16:44] <SamB> @pid

[16:44] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: i'm friendly. :)

[16:44] <SamB> ?pid

[16:44] <SamB> why are they both acting dead?

[16:44] <Juerd> thoughtpolice: I'll await your email

[16:45] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: hm hope mutt/gmail isn't fowling up.

[16:45] <gaal> Juerd: I don't know; what's the penalty for breaking the c speed limit?

[16:46] <thoughtpolice> gaal: you get charged for 'breaking physics' and we hope that you have a backup.

[16:47] <gaal> like all backups, it's the restore that's scary

[16:48] <thoughtpolice> i'd rather be a little scared with a backup than SOL with none; especially in the case of those physics people talk about so much. they seem important.

[16:49] <gaal> .oO(resonance cascade)

[16:51] <thoughtpolice> @help unlambda

[16:51] <lambdabot> unlambda <expr>. Evaluate an unlambda expression

[16:51] <lambdabot2> unlambda <expr>. Evaluate an unlambda expression

[16:52] <thoughtpolice> figured.

[16:52] *** alecs joined
[16:52] <alecs> hi ther 

[16:52] <thoughtpolice> i think the two lambdabots need to settle it though; I think fighting to the end is out of the question though

[16:52] <thoughtpolice> alecs: hi

[16:54] <thoughtpolice> @slap lambdabot2

[16:54] <lambdabot> why on earth would I slap lambdabot2

[16:54] * lambdabot2 beats up lambdabot2

[16:54] <Juerd> Speaking of backups

[16:54] <Juerd> I need a better way of doing backups on feather

[16:54] <Juerd> I want something in between tar and rsync

[16:54] <alecs> i'm a noob in perl scripting . can anyone help/tell how to make/configure a scrip that adds ip addresses from the logs into the firewall ?

[16:55] <Juerd> rsync doesn't repeat what it has already done (incremental tar is too scary), which is good

[16:55] <Juerd> But rsync doesn't store permissions and ownership, which is bad.

[16:55] <[particle]> alecs: you probably want the good folks at irc.perl.org#perl

[16:55] <thoughtpolice> ouch. :(

[16:55] <Juerd> tar is the other way around :(

[16:55] <[particle]> alecs: we're talking about perl 6 here, you're probably using perl 5

[16:56] <Juerd> alecs: And if you're using Perl 6, I'll get you an apple pie :)

[16:56] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: hm I had something on backups a week or two ago; I'll try to find something (maybe there's a 'tarsync' around somewhere)

[16:56] <Juerd> tar isn't indexed, so I doubt it.

[16:56] * gaal agrees that would be a great name

[16:56] <Juerd> I want something that is fully omnicompatible

[16:56] <Juerd> That is: if it isn'n on a standard KNOPPIX live cd, it's out of the question :)

[16:57] <Juerd> Because indeed restoring is the scariest part

[16:57] <thoughtpolice> darn. :/ 'cause I just found this: http://www.rsnapshot.org/

[16:57] <lambdabot2> Title: rsnapshot

[16:57] <lambdabot> Title: rsnapshot

[16:57] <thoughtpolice> it's written in perl too. appropriate. :)

[16:58] <Juerd> That uses rsync, so I doubt it stores ownership without root access

[16:59] <gaal> neighborly shower&

[17:00] *** rindolf joined
[17:00] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: hm well if I find anything useful I'll let you know. I'm pretty sure that there're more than 2 backup programs; ubiquity is the problem though.

[17:00] <thoughtpolice> so :(

[17:01] <Juerd> I was thinking of maybe generating a shell script to restore ownership.

[17:01] <Juerd> It would be a big bunch of

[17:01] <Juerd> chown root:root /etc

[17:01] <Juerd> etc

[17:01] <Juerd> Heh. "etc" :)

[17:24] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: have you still not recieved my email?

[17:27] *** lluad joined
[17:30] <thoughtpolice> hm. wondering, what revision control systems do you guys use? (I've fallen in love with darcs, but mercurial's been looking really interesting lately)

[17:32] <lluad> I'm just migrating from CVS to subversion, so I'm way, way behind the fashion trend. :)

[17:34] <thoughtpolice> quite. :)

[17:34] <thoughtpolice> i like decentralized approaches, although I don't have a problem with subversion really.

[17:37] <Juerd> thoughtpolice: No, but you may be greylisted.

[17:38] <Juerd> thoughtpolice: gmail mail can take several hours because they use MANY different source IPs, and don't re-use the same IP for the retries.

[17:38] <Juerd> I haven't found a way to fix that problem yet - can't just whitelist them because they don't publish a list of IPs.

[17:38] <thoughtpolice> Juerd: I thought so; I generally send my mail through mutt, but gmail acts as my smtp server

[17:39] <thoughtpolice> normally it's fairly snappy in delivery though :/

[17:39] <lluad> They have SPF records. You could rip a list of IPs from that, probably. Dunno if it's worth the bother.

[17:49] <Juerd> thoughtpolice: It is snappy, but it gets greylisted repeatedly.

[17:51] <thoughtpolice> bummer.

[17:51] <TimToady> gaal: that's very interesting what you said to BrowserUK about monads and semicolons.  Makes me see a list of Capture as a kind of untyped monad literal, and statements vs slices vs flat as three contextual monads available by default in P6.

[17:52] *** larsen_ joined
[17:54] <TimToady> using the term "monad" loosely, of course...

[17:56] <TimToady> let's see, if statements are essentially IO monad, and flat is the list monad, what's a slice monad in Haskell...?

[17:57] *** buetow joined
[17:57] <TimToady> is there some kind of monad that the dimensions of a subscript happen in the right order, or is that also just the list monad?

[18:11] <thoughtpolice> i think I know most of the base monads but I don't exactly know how to relate it with what TimToady is asking (probably because I can't follow it but that might just be me)

[18:21] <gogonkt1> anyone know howto display big5, gbk in haskell?

[18:22] <gogonkt1> are there lib for this?

[18:24] <moritz> what do you mean by "display"? if your terminal runs that encoding, it shouldn't be a problem

[18:24] <moritz> gogonkt1: or do you want to convert it to/from other encondings?

[18:26] <gogonkt1> moritz: some irc channel use big5 or GBK , and my xp use gbk, so ...

[18:27] <gogonkt1> moritz: I want print GBK in win cli

[18:30] <moritz> though "It makes use of some knowledge of glibc's iconv that isn't guaranteed by the standard.

[18:30] <moritz> doesn't sound too good

[18:34] <gogonkt1> Thx! moritz , I'll try it
