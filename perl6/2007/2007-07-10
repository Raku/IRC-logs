[08:51] <moritz> masak: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/

[08:51] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/yp8qyt

[08:52] <masak> definitely an improvement

[08:52] <masak> I think it wastes space in a good way

[08:53] <masak> if you're too worried about it, I'd suggest adding some CSS to remove the table cell borders

[08:53] <moritz> I'll let Aankhen`` do that, I don't want to take that pleasure from him ;)

[08:54] <masak> ok, me neither ;)

[08:54] <moritz> unfortunately HTML::Calendar::Simple is not so CSS friendly

[08:55] <masak> nothing is set in stone

[08:55] <moritz> aye ;)

[08:56] <Alias_> Although building in CSS support from the start helps a LOT

[08:56] <Alias_> <-- PPI::HTML

[08:57] <moritz> Alias_: do you know by chance if PPI or Text::VimColor generate "better" markup for perl?

[08:58] <Alias_> PPI::HTML is by far the most accurate markup in existance

[08:58] <wolverian> vim isn't particularly accurate.

[08:58] <Alias_> You might need to play and tweak the CSS a bit, and maybe subclass PPI::HTML for anything esoteric

[08:58] <Alias_> But it's absolutely better than anything else

[08:59] <Alias_> Just a bit of a CPU hog for big files (because of PPI)

[08:59] <moritz> Alias_: ok I'll try it out

[08:59] <Alias_> I was using an Apache plugin for a while, but then google started trawling my repository and it killed the server somewhat

[08:59] <moritz> vim has the advantag of knowing >300  languages/config files

[08:59] <Alias_> ya

[09:00] <moritz> Alias_: use robots.txt ;)

[09:00] <Alias_> I do now

[09:00] <Alias_> After google deleted a production database 

[09:00] <Alias_> Because I accidentally left a database management web app exposed, and it went down the tool.pl/DatabaseSetup?cmd=purge;db=whatever link

[09:01] <moritz> :(

[09:01] <Alias_> ya, not fun

[09:01] <Alias_> Big lesson for the future though

[09:02] <Alias_> I'm going to rewrite my connection pool at some point so that it only hands out read-only connections to GET requests

[09:02] <moritz> "never leeave a management toll without password protection"

[09:02] <Alias_> Oh it had password support

[09:03] <Alias_> The config file got reset due to version control,  and if the config doesn't list a password, it doesn't use it

[09:03] <Alias_> Something multi-factor like that from memory

[09:03] <moritz> ouch

[09:13] <trippeh> Heh, any data modifying action should be a POST though, not GET...

[09:13] <trippeh> This is one of the reasons

[09:13] <Alias_> yep

[09:13] <wolverian> or PUT, but ...

[09:13] <wolverian> (or DELETE, for that matter)

[09:13] <Alias_> Although this makes data-stored sessions interesting

[09:13] * wolverian wishes browsers weren't so crippled

[09:13] <Alias_> Because strictly speaking you couldn't nudge last_request dates on the session in a GET

[09:14] <Alias_> (which could be bad, but I'm not sure)

[09:14] <Alias_> Maybe I could rejigger it so that it had permissions to update the session table, but that's all

[09:15] <Alias_> Instead of being a pure readonly connection

[09:16] <Alias_> I suspect my connection-pooling needs are getting complex enough to write a standalone module :)

[09:16] <Alias_> 3 classes of connections (shared read-only, shared auto-commit, and transaction pool)

[09:16] *** Blwood[dodo] is now known as Blwood

[09:16] <moritz> Alias_: are you writing a http server in perl?

[09:17] <Alias_> Just regular webapps

[09:17] <Alias_> But I have a fairly interesting ORM layer

[09:17] <Alias_> Better than anyone else, in my opinion

[09:17] *** andara joined
[09:17] <Alias_> But unfortunately based on code-generation, so not CPAN'able

[09:17] <moritz> self made?

[09:17] <Alias_> yeah

[09:18] <Alias_> I talk to mst quite a bit, and he's gradually stealing some of the better ideas from it

[09:18] <moritz> ORM-Compiler, YaY

[09:18] <Alias_> for DBIx::Class

[09:18] <moritz> (idea stealing)++

[09:18] <masak> Alias_: what's particularly good about it?

[09:19] <Alias_> You design the structure in entity-relational terms

[09:19] <Alias_> And the codegen produces both a sane schema and sane code to talk to it

[09:19] <masak> nice

[09:19] <Alias_> And it can handle 100% of all structures

[09:19] <Alias_> Handles importing and exporting circular data references

[09:19] <masak> so far it sounds like Hibernate to me

[09:20] <Alias_> It can do queries with infite arbitrary foreign key traversal

[09:20] <moritz> "combine the crazyness of perl with the power of databases"

[09:20] <Alias_> $query = Class->select;

[09:20] <moritz> or was it the other way round? ;)

[09:21] <masak> Alias_: cool

[09:21] <Alias_> $query->add_condition( 'self.parents.friends.children.school.teachers.pets.name', '=', 'Spot' );

[09:21] *** SchwarzeSchwuler joined
[09:21] *** SchwarzeSchwuler left
[09:21] <Alias_> It generates it's own schema 

[09:22] <Alias_> So the code can create it's own database structures

[09:22] <Alias_> And it can handle superfluous tables and columns

[09:22] <wolverian> "its" :)

[09:22] <moritz> Alias_: how do you distinguish references from string literals?

[09:22] <Alias_> It knows what entity names are reserved words in various databases and renames around the problem

[09:22] <Alias_> moritz: hmm?

[09:23] <Alias_> It has a model of the entity-relationships

[09:23] <moritz> Alias_: I guess 'self.parents. ...' is treated as a database column...

[09:23] <Alias_> not necesarily

[09:23] <Alias_> It's not 1 to 1

[09:23] <moritz> Alias_: and 'Spot' is a string constant, right?

[09:23] <Alias_> .friends may involve traversing a many to many rable

[09:23] <Alias_> table

[09:23] <moritz> ok, but it's not treated as a string constant

[09:23] <Alias_> or going backwards across a relationship, because it's the OTHER side of the relationship that has the column

[09:23] <moritz> whereas 'Spot' is treated as a constant, right?

[09:24] <Alias_> the entity model knows the difference between data and relationships

[09:24] <Alias_> The "=" condition class knows the data types it's allowed to build a condition for

[09:24] <Alias_> So if you tried that on something that wasn't a string or a number, it would barf

[09:24] <moritz> so if you have some external input, $dog_name, how can you be sure that it doesn't contain a string that describes a column and messes up your whole system?

[09:25] <Alias_> huh?

[09:25] <Alias_> Because of sql placeholders...

[09:25] <Alias_> The SQL generation handles placeholders

[09:25] <moritz> so you add sql placeholders in add_condition and the like?

[09:25] <Alias_> As it builds the SQL it keeps track of them and aggregates them in the correct order as it merges the parts of the query

[09:25] <Alias_> "=" is implemented by code

[09:26] <moritz> I think we are talking about different levels...

[09:26] <Alias_> There's also things like "approx"

[09:26] <moritz> if I do a $object->add_condition($foo => $bar)...

[09:26] <Alias_> you don't

[09:26] <moritz> why not?

[09:27] <Alias_> conditions are (subject, condition, value, value, ... )

[09:27] <Alias_> like in rdf

[09:27] <Alias_> Although obviously, nothing like rdf :)

[09:27] <Alias_> A condition expression is three parts

[09:27] <moritz> ok, add_condition($foo, '=', $bar)

[09:27] <moritz> how does it know how to interpret $foo and $bar?

[09:28] <Alias_> $foo is going to refer to some model element

[09:28] <Alias_> So it's split by . and mapped to the entity model

[09:28] <moritz> ok

[09:28] <moritz> and $bar?

[09:28] <Alias_> Depends on the condition

[09:28] <moritz> let's assume '='

[09:29] <Alias_> sql_equal_to( $resolved_property, $bar )

[09:29] <Alias_> sql_equal_to knows it needs $bar to be of data type $resolved_property->data_type

[09:29] <moritz> and how does that handle $bar?

[09:29] <Alias_> And it returns [ 'sql fragement including a ?', $bar ]

[09:30] <Alias_> fragment

[09:30] <moritz> ok, so $bar is _alway_ treated as constant?

[09:30] <Alias_> ah, I get you

[09:30] <moritz> s/alway/always/

[09:30] <Alias_> you want column A = column B

[09:31] <moritz> I want to know how it dispatches between string B and column B

[09:31] <Alias_> You'd need a new condition 

[09:31] <Alias_> add_condition( $foo, 'column-wise equal', $bar )

[09:31] <Alias_> I don't currently have an implementation of that

[09:31] <moritz> ok

[09:31] <moritz> then I'm happy for the moment ;)

[09:31] <Alias_> But it's probably possibly

[09:32] <Alias_> resolve the properties of $bar like for $foo, make sure that they are in the same table

[09:32] <moritz> ... or that you do a join

[09:32] <Alias_> I don't do joins

[09:32] <moritz> ok

[09:32] <Alias_> It's all done with subselects

[09:32] <Alias_> I mostly use postgres, which can do query rewriting across up to 7 subselects and turn it into The Right Thing

[09:33] <moritz> is that efficient?

[09:33] <moritz> ok

[09:33] <Alias_> There's three choices

[09:33] * moritz ends up saying "ok" all the time

[09:33] <Alias_> 1. Implement it in wetware (my head)

[09:33] <moritz> ?eval "ok" xx 5

[09:33] *** evalbot_r16941 is now known as evalbot_r16959

[09:33] <evalbot_r16959> ("ok", "ok", "ok", "ok", "ok")

[09:33] <Alias_> 2. Implement query rewriting in Perl (also from my head)

[09:33] <Alias_> 3. Implement it inside the database (not in my head)

[09:34] <wolverian> postgres++ # not crap

[09:34] <Alias_> Also, do you have any idea how complicates a join would be for self.parents.friends.children.school.teachers.pets.name

[09:34] <Alias_> which goes across at least one many to many

[09:34] <moritz> no, I don't, and I don't want to have an idea ;)

[09:35] <moritz> let other people handle the complexity ;)

[09:35] <Alias_> The nice thing about subselects is that while it might not always be stunningly fast, you can reach 100% coverage for all relationship types

[09:35] <Alias_> recursively

[09:35] <Alias_> I do a couple of small tricks to limit the problem

[09:36] <Alias_> if you had a self.parents.friends.children.school.teachers.pets.name and self.parents.friends.school.pupils.name conditions, it would merge the two at the "school" level

[09:36] <Alias_> So it merges conditions in a tree-like shape (in entity relationship terms)

[09:36] <Alias_> Which seems to work

[09:37] <Alias_> If you run explain on postgres for equivalent join and subselect queries, it actually implements it in terms about halfway between the two 

[09:37] <Alias_> in processes

[09:37] <Alias_> table scans, index commands etc

[09:38] <Alias_> Anyways, my code does some funky stuff when you say $object->store

[09:38] <Alias_> Because the values might need to be stored in multiple SQL commands

[09:38] <Alias_> So it pulls transactions internally sometimes from the connection manager

[09:38] <Alias_> And hence, I need a fairly robust connection manager

[09:39] <moritz> that doesn't sound very portable across databases

[09:39] <Alias_> codegen :)

[09:39] <Alias_> I have implementations for MySQL, Postgres and Oracle

[09:39] <Alias_> SQLite I can't build, because it doesn't have sequences

[09:39] <Alias_> But for the most parts, it does work properly between the three

[09:39] <moritz> I witdraw my last comment ;)

[09:40] <Alias_> The speed penalty is probably worse on some database

[09:40] <Alias_> But really, I only added MySQL support because I felt I had to, not for the speed

[09:40] <moritz> ;)

[09:40] <Alias_> And because I expected client-requests for it

[09:41] <Alias_> It's already slower, since I have to use innodb, and emulate sequences

[09:41] <wolverian> sqlite doesn't have sequences?! weird, I thought it did

[09:41] <Alias_> nope :(

[09:42] <Alias_> He added auto_increment instead

[09:42] <wolverian> oh

[09:42] <Alias_> You can't get a table id before insertion

[09:42] <Alias_> Which is absolutely critical 

[09:42] <wolverian> not first class, then

[09:42] <Alias_> ya

[09:42] <Alias_> And you can't emulate it

[09:42] <wolverian> too bad. 

[09:42] <wolverian> thanks for telling me that :)

[09:42] <Alias_> Because sequence actions need to occur outside of transactions

[09:42] <Alias_> And SQLite has a global lock

[09:43] <Alias_> So if you are inside a transaction, and you try to pull a sequence value, it deadlocks

[09:44] <Alias_> If I REALLY need it, I'll write an emulation implementation that does the sequence table in a seperate database

[09:44] <Alias_> And according to audrey, there's a new thingy that lets you connect to two different sqlite files as one virtual database

[09:44] <Alias_> If the locks are file-granular, that might work

[09:44] <Alias_> I've never had the time for a proper proof of concept though

[09:45] <wolverian> sequences for sqlite might be an interesting soc project

[12:15] <lichtkind> nene schon gut deustch is mir lieber tschechisch grad am liebsten

[12:16] <lichtkind> ganz gut  danke bin nur etwas verwirrt

[12:16] <bloonix> ich dachte an die anderen hier :)

[12:16] <bloonix> was ist denn los?

[12:19] <lichtkind> bloonix: your right i had 5 tabs in my irc client an thought im in perlde, what are you doing here? infected by my article ?

[12:20] <lichtkind> bloonix:  btw its ready now if you like to see it

[12:20] * moritz welcomes the german perl6 guys ;)

[12:20] <lichtkind> hihi moin

[12:21] <bloonix> I had a bit trouble on perlde so I though to avoid it. yes I read your perl 6 introduction on p-c.de and wanted to start a bit and where could I get a better start as here? :)

[12:22] <bloonix> hi moritz

[12:22] <moritz> bloonix: http://perl-6.de/tutorials/ if you want a german introduction

[12:22] <lambdabot> Title: Perl 6 - Tutorials

[12:23] <bloonix> moritz: already done ;)

[12:23] <moritz> bloonix: then what more introduction do you want?

[12:23] <bloonix> on p-c.de are a lot of shortcuts on one site. I like that

[12:24] <moritz> something like a cheat sheat?

[12:24] <bloonix> I need a lot of code examples

[12:24] <bloonix> to know how can I write nice letters in Perl 6 ;)

[12:25] <moritz> bloonix: then look into the pugs repository...

[12:25] <moritz> in examples/, or in src/perl6/Prelude*

[12:25] <moritz> or for regexes in src/perl6-Perl-6.0.0-STD.pm

[12:27] *** agentzh joined
[12:27] <lichtkind> bloonix: do you mean the perl 6 tutorial on p-c.de wiki, there is also link to  http://perl-6.de/tutorials/ i

[12:27] <lambdabot> Title: Perl 6 - Tutorials

[12:28] <bloonix> moritz: I should put a link on my home page to your introduction

[12:28] <moritz> bloonix: do that please ;)

[12:28] <moritz> bloonix: and if you have suggestions what else to add, please let me know as well

[12:31] <bloonix> lichtkind: I read the article if you like

[12:31] <lichtkind> moritz: =<> goes also in perl6 like =$*IN ?

[12:32] <lichtkind> bloonix: cool but its now cold and gone, (third deadline :))

[12:33] <moritz> lichtkind: afaict it's like the p5 <@ARGV>

[12:33] *** Limbic_Region joined
[12:34] <moritz> lichtkind: but I'm not entirely sure about that, maybe it's =$*IN

[12:42] <moritz> or how the menus are built?

[12:42] <lichtkind> moritz: the idea of the structure of the whole site

[12:42] <lichtkind> also the design could support the content more

[12:43] <moritz> I'm not aware of a very elaborate structure - just a normal tree structure like most other static sites

[12:44] <moritz> lichtkind: could you tell me more about the design, and how I could improve it?

[12:45] <moritz> lichtkind: allright, no hurry ;)

[13:11] <masak> fglock: what's the progress status of kp6?

[13:12] <fglock> masak: it's following the plan, roughly - http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/docs/kp6-roadmap.pod

[13:12] <lambdabot> fglock: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.

[13:12] <fglock> currently improving the regex engine

[13:12] <masak> fglock: ok

[13:13] <fglock> next phase will implement more library functions

[13:13] <moritz> fglock: the kp6 prelude, so to say?

[13:15] <fglock> yes, and it is missing some low level classes too

[13:17] <fglock> these are the things that it needs in order to run the Perl6-STD grammar

[13:19] * agentzh wants to hack on kp6.

[13:20] <fglock> agentzh: there are some simple things to do

[13:20] <avar> agentzh: I started fiddling with writing grammars in PCR, noticed some differences from p6

[13:21] <agentzh> oh?

[13:21] <avar> like when I wrote C<< token digit { <[0..9]> } token digits { $<num> := [ <digit>+ ] } >> in p6 I could do:

[13:21] <agentzh> there are always simple things :)

[13:21] <avar> "123" ~~ /<digits>/; say $/<num>;

[13:22] <avar> but to get that in pcr I have to do:

[13:22] <avar> C<< token digit { <[0..9]> } token digits { $<num> := [ <digit>+ ] { return { num => $$<num>> } } } >>

[13:22] <agentzh> avar: really?

[13:22] <lichtkind> fglock++

[13:22] <avar> I.e. it doesn't automatically make named and numbered captures part of the result object..

[13:23] <agentzh> avar: i think it can be easily fixed by adding tokens to Pugs::Grammar::Base

[13:23] <avar> agentzh: I just wrote that up by hand but yes, roughly

[13:23] <avar> What? Adding a token digit {} ?

[13:23] <diakopter> Alias_: you still around?

[13:23] <agentzh> avar: the match object is okay in PCR, no?

[13:23] <fglock> avar: that should work

[13:23] <agentzh> avar: yup

[13:24] <avar> I'm talking about the general idea of result objects not a digit token in particular

[13:24] <agentzh> avar: named captures: $match->{'name'}

[13:24] <agentzh> avar: numbered captures: $match->[num]

[13:25] <avar> I had a testcase where the grammar I was porting from pugs didn't work at all unless I did what I said above, manually made a hash of things that were already being captured as $<> := []

[13:25] <avar> I'll try to get it to you later-ish

[13:25] <agentzh> avar: okay

[13:26] <fglock> avar: [] captures a string, always (but let me check)

[13:26] *** jisom_ joined
[13:28] <fglock> if you use / $<x> := [ some captures here ] / then you lose the data structure, and only get the matched string

[13:28] <fglock> you need to use parentheses instead

[13:29] <avar> I'll try that (later)

[13:30] <avar> but whatever the issue was it was behaving differently in pugs and pcr

[13:37] <moritz> wow, somebody found my homepage searching for "pugs" on result page number 47 (!) ;)

[15:42] <moritz> cool

[15:42] <Juerd> moritz: Money is no longer the problem, but any donation would still be welcome. Every dollar or euro can help to get bigger CPUs, or perhaps a spare hard drive :)

[15:43] <moritz> Juerd: I'm willing to donate up to 150€ if you tell me what you do with it ;)

[15:44] <Juerd> moritz: A bigger CPU in the new hardware.

[15:44] <moritz> Juerd: write me an email with your IBAN and BIC code, then I can transfer the money to you

[15:45] <Juerd> moritz: Which address?

[15:46] <Juerd> Note that I have to charge 19% VAT btw

[15:46] <Juerd> If you have a european business, I can send you an invoice and it's 0% then

[15:46] <moritz> Juerd: I do have

[15:47] <Juerd> Please let me know the VAT number

[15:47] <moritz> I don't have it yet, I only opened my buisiness the other day :(

[15:47] <Juerd> Oh. I can send you the invoice later

[15:48] <moritz> after the bank transfer?

[15:49] *** Blwood joined
[15:49] <Juerd> moritz: In any order you wish :)

[15:49] <Juerd> I don't know if your country allows payment without prior invoice.

[15:49] <moritz> I hope so ;)

[15:50] *** Blwood joined
[15:50] <moritz> Juerd: I've done my transfer now, you should receive the money during the next few days

[15:53] <Juerd> moritz: On behalf of dozens of feather users, thank you :)

[15:53] <moritz> this is so cool - in the EU transfers to other countries may not cost more than within the country, so it's free for me ;)

[15:53] <moritz> Juerd: you're welcome

[15:53] <Juerd> Yes, it's free -- iff you say "shared costs"

[15:53] <Juerd> If you say "I pay everything" or "recipient pays everything", then voila: expenses!

[15:54] <Juerd> Which is a problem because many people pick "I'm paying" because they don't want the recipient to pay...

[15:54] <moritz> Juerd: if we host that p6explain/decrypt/perldoc project on feather I'll want an account - right now I'm fine without

[15:55] <moritz> I didn't have a choice :(

[15:55] <Juerd> moritz: If you want an account, please request it by email.

[15:55] <moritz> regarding the paiment thing

[15:55] <Juerd> That's good :)

[15:55] <moritz> Juerd: Aye, I'm just moosing randomly...

[15:55] <Juerd> Being forced into the free option is good.

[15:56] <moritz> btw what location in the pugs repository would you suggest?

[16:23] <moritz> masak: I thought about it, but ext/ is reservered for P6 modules...

[16:23] <agentzh> is it a Perl 6 module?

[16:24] <agentzh> moritz: right :)

[16:24] <moritz> masak: and it'll mostly be a collection of data, with some p5 and p6 modules perhaps

[20:03] <fglock_> WiNK79: or http://perlmonks.org

[20:05] <fglock_> mncharity: btw, the root directory for running kp6 is v6/v6-KindaPerl6/

[20:07] <fglock_> mncharity: the idea is that the match creates a linked-list of operations, which grows and shrink as the perl5 regex matches/backtracks; the list is converted to a Match object on demand

[20:07] *** weinig joined
[20:07] <fglock_> the linear structure is much easier to manage than the match tree

[20:09] *** rho joined
[20:10] <mncharity> ./lib5/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Match.pm vs lib5regex/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Match.pm ?

[20:11] <mncharity> ah, neat idea

[20:11] <fglock_> lib5regex is the p6rx-on-p5rx Match class; lib5 is for the mp5 regex engine

[20:11] <fglock_> mp6

[20:13] <fglock_> I mean: lib5regex/ is the p6rx-on-p5rx runtime; lib5/ is the mp6 runtime

[20:13] <mncharity> so it's just that one file in lib5regex/ I should be looking at?

[20:14] <mncharity> oh, no docs, and output of the test script

[20:14] <fglock_> yes, that's the runtime; you can see the compiled script by piping into perltidy

[20:15] <fglock_>   perl kp6-perl5.pl --perl5rx < examples/token-test.pl | perltidy

[20:16] *** dduncan joined
[20:17] <mncharity> re "after the match finishes, the operations are interpreted, and the result is a Match object", you will also have to do it during the matching, if the regex itself uses the match.

[20:17] <fglock_> the emitter is: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/lib/KindaPerl6/Visitor/EmitPerl5Regex.pm

[20:17] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/2h6f5d

[20:17] <fglock_> yes, it does that

[20:17] <fglock_> it is currently a copy, but I can make it rw by using references

[20:18] <fglock_> or by making a diff

[21:54] <Aankhen``> Idiot moment.  Could two conforming Perl 6 implementations generate different ASTs for the same snippet of code, all other things being equal?

[21:57] <lumi> Aankhen``: I don't think we have an AST spec

[21:57] <lumi> Also, I think you can optimize on the AST level

[21:57] <spinclad> Aankhen``: sure

[21:57] <Aankhen``> Thanks.

[21:58] <Aankhen``> I felt like the answer was obvious, but for some reason I had a mental block.

[21:58] <Aankhen``> (Hence the "idiot moment".  I tend to have a lot of those. :-P)

[22:40] <nothingmuch> w 12

[22:50] <dduncan> I would expect there to be an AST spec, at least insomuch as that the syntax for writing Perl 6 macros can take or return ASTs

[22:51] <avar> the std parser is pretty much an AST spec

[22:51] <dduncan> mind you, that could just be a role/interface to the ASTs, and not be how they are implemented internally

[22:53] <[particle1> perhaps once somebody is near the point of implementing perl6 macros, a standard will develop.
