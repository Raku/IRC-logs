[13:49] <xinming_> @seen audreyt

[13:49] <lambdabot> audreyt is in #haskell and #ghc. I don't know when audreyt last spoke.

[14:01] <moritz_> xinming_: according to the irc logs at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/search.pl?channel=perl6&nick=audreyt&q= the last activity was 2007-07-15 in this channel

[14:01] <lambdabot> Title: IRC logs - Search

[14:05] * xinming_ misses audreyt. even if she never commit. >_<

[14:05] *** theorb left
[14:09] <masak> xinming_: that sentiment is probably shared by many here. but it seems that audreyt needs to recharge and find a more sustainable lifestyle. 2005/2006 were likely very draining for her. I wish her all the rest she deserves, and that she not feel obliged to come back before she feels ready.

[14:09] <masak> in the meantime, I'm trying to understand pugs while it's not a moving target :)

[14:14] <masak> moritz_: how does the highlighting work in the above search link?

[14:14] <masak> it seems pretty random

[14:14] <moritz_> masak: it pretty much works if no matches are in the context

[14:15] <moritz_> masak: every search result is padded with 2 (I think) lines of context ...

[14:15] <moritz_> masak: and if results occur in the context they aren't hilighted

[14:15] <moritz_> I'm to lazy to do it right[tm]

[14:16] <moritz_> the logs show that the search isn't used very much, so I see no point in it

[14:16] <masak> oki

[14:16] <masak> no worries

[14:17] <masak> just a bit confused over the logic behind it :)

[14:17] <moritz_> .oO( it's all in the pugs repo, so feel free to fix it ;)

[14:17] <masak> great :)

[14:17] * masak puts it on some abstract personal TODO list

[14:18] * moritz_ wonders if he shouldn't use sphinx or some other OSS search engine

[14:18] <moritz_> mysql is very slow when many matches are found

[14:18] <moritz_> or my implementation using mysql, that is ;)

[16:43] <dlocaus> sorry guys, been working on another project "off and on"

[16:44] <moritz_> dlocaus: most of us work that way

[16:45] <moritz_> no need to apologize

[16:45] <dlocaus>  :)

[16:50] <dlocaus> kp6 is a mini project to help get perl6 going?

[16:50] * dlocaus was reading v6/docs/kp6-roadmap-...?

[16:51] *** dieken joined
[16:51] <moritz_> dlocaus: it's one of the possible bootstrapping roads

[16:51] <dlocaus> what is pugs then?

[16:52] <moritz_> another road ;)

[16:52] <PerlJam> A haskell implementation of perl 6.

[16:53] <PerlJam> dlocaus: There are several implementation-paths for perl 6: haskell, perl5, parrot  (and maybe others that I don't know about)

[16:53] <dlocaus> parrot?  Isn't parrot the "assembly" code of perl6?

[16:53] <dlocaus> actually, a CISC set for perl6?

[16:53] <PerlJam> something like that.

[16:54] *** dieken left
[16:54] <moritz_> dlocaus: yes, but there's a parrot based implemetation as well...

[16:54] <moritz_> dlocaus: parrot comes with compiler tools (TGE, PGE) that are very handy

[16:54] <dlocaus> hummm

[16:55] <moritz_> the big difference between kp6 and the other projects is that kp6 is written in itself

[16:55] <moritz_> s/written/compiled by/

[16:55] <moritz_> nearly there, at least

[16:55] *** dieken joined
[16:56] <dlocaus> ok

[16:57] <PerlJam> and while pugs and kp6 are specifically for perl 6, parrot is meant to be used for other languages as well.

[16:57] <PerlJam> (hence the compiler tools)

[16:58] <dlocaus> yes.

[16:58] <dlocaus> It's just trying to figure out how kp6 works.

[16:58] <moritz_> it's run by magic

[16:58] <PerlJam> dlocaus: hang around here an ask questions :)

[16:58] <moritz_> small fairies whirling through your CPU and memory

[16:58] <dlocaus> at the moment, I have to re-install firefox... for some reason, its not processing file types properly

[16:59] <dlocaus> .txt, .jpg etc..

[16:59] <PerlJam> moritz_: so ... the reason we don't have perl 6 today is not enough fairies? ;)

[16:59] <dlocaus> moritz_: is there anything I can help with?

[17:00] <moritz_> PerlJam: yes

[17:00] <moritz_> dlocaus: I'm not up-to-date atm... try to ask fglock or spinclad 

[17:00] *** pmurias joined
[17:00] <dlocaus> fglock: is there anything I can help out with?

[17:01] <dlocaus> I saw there was soemthing about refactoring MOP -> Runtime::(lost to memory)

[17:01] <fglock> dlocaus: I'm working on autovivification atm

[17:01] <pmurias> dlocaus: parrot is the cpu , pir is the assembly

[17:01] <fglock> I've added several TODO items to the list

[17:02] * dlocaus would die without wikipedia.

[17:03] * fglock looks up TODO in wikipedia

[17:03] <dlocaus> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autovivification

[17:03] <fglock> ah, that

[17:04] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:05] <dlocaus> r18844 | fglock++ | [kp6] added Runtime::Perl5::Container; to be refactored out from MOP.pm

[17:06] <dlocaus> that is what I was looking for.

[17:06] <dlocaus> opps... he finished it

[17:06] <pugs_svn> r18846 | fglock++ | [kp6] partial impl of $a{'key'} autovivification

[17:07] <fglock> dlocaus: you could factor out "Value" (including Str, Int, ...)

[17:08] <dlocaus> fglock: I would be happy to.  Can you tell me how you what you want the destination code look like?

[17:09] <dlocaus> ie: dlocaus: find each $::Int=make_class(...)+related code and put it into Rutime::Perl5::(insert name here)?

[17:09] *** penk joined
[17:10] *** barney joined
[17:10] <dlocaus> fglock: do you want me to use Runtime::Perl5::Container for as an example?

[17:11] <fglock> dlocaus: yes - it starts near $::Value, and the module is Value.pm

[17:11] <fglock> it doesn't need to include the "dispatch" thing, because that belongs to Object

[17:11] <dlocaus> you just want a ".pl" file of sorts, you are not looking for a "package" delcarion correct?

[17:12] <dlocaus> "grep package Container.pm" yields no results.

[17:12] <fglock> svk up ?

[17:12] <dlocaus> I am upto date

[17:12] <dlocaus> there is no "package" in the file

[17:13] <fglock> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-KindaPerl6/src/KindaPerl6/Runtime/Perl5/Container.pm

[17:13] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/ypnt38

[17:13] <fglock> the classes are global - there is no "package"

[17:13] <fglock> they are "perl 6" "packages"

[17:13] <dlocaus> I mean

[17:13] <dlocaus> package Runtime::Perl5::Container;

[17:14] <fglock> yes, there are only "Perl 6 land" classes

[17:14] <dlocaus> while the classes are global, I'm not sure what happens to the variables declared in files like Container.pm

[17:14] <fglock> which are created with make_class

[17:15] <fglock> "Scalar" is stored in $main::Scalar in Perl 5
