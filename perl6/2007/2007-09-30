[14:50] <Aankhen``> pmurias: I tried using join, but as I said, that gives me all sorts of errors.

[14:51] <Aankhen``> It's also weird because I have $GLOBAL::x in the Perl 6 code, which has the same namespace as &say (thanks to Visitor::Global), but only $GLOBAL::x shows that behaviour and not &say.

[14:51] <Aankhen``> The join for &say works just fine.

[14:52] <Aankhen``> AFAICT, the AST is the same (after Visitor::Global) for both of them, leaving aside the different variable name & sigil.

[14:54] <pmurias> '"' ~ $.namespace.join('::') ~ '"'; seems to work fine

[14:54] <pmurias> line 254 for say $Foo::Bar::x;

[14:56] <pmurias> could you give a code example which gives the error

[15:49] * allbery_b helped someone else some time back but it was more trying to decipher the documentation (such as it is)

[15:50] <pinskian> there's a BN_bntompi() function supposed to do the conversion (bignum -> mpi) 

[15:50] <pinskian> but it expects a buffer, so there must be a way to know the size of that buffer either by a max constant or by arithmetics based on bignum size

[21:14] <fglock> Aankhen``: I'm considering removing ::Assign, ::Bind, and ::Apply nodes, since these are really just method calls

[21:15] <fglock> does it makes sense for Lisp?

[21:18] <Aankhen``> What sort of method calls are they?

[21:19] <Aankhen``> (Sorry, I don't quite grasp the implications, as you can tell. :-)

[21:21] <Aankhen``> I'm not really sure.

[21:21] <Aankhen``> But you should do it based on what makes sense in the big picture.  I don't know much about writing emitters, I'm just learning as I go along.

[21:22] <fglock> ok (just planning for now)

[21:31] <Aankhen``> Is there anything we're missing for subs?

[21:32] <Aankhen``> (I consider the topic of signatures to be part of implementing them, in case there's any confusion. :-)

[21:34] <fglock> the code for signatures is still incomplete in kp6

[21:34] <Aankhen``> I just want to get it up to par with the Perl 5 emitter.
