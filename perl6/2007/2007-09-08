[00:07] <juerd> feather is going down for its hardware upgrade real soon now

[00:08] <juerd> I'm going to try and mount its filesystems readonly

[00:08] <juerd> If that works, you can still IRC and do stuff like that

[00:08] <juerd> If not, I'm taking it offline

[12:32] <szbalint> yay

[12:33] <Juerd> Now use it :)

[12:33] <Juerd> It's scary seeing a 0.0x load

[12:33] <masak> heh

[12:33] <masak> give people time to adjust

[12:34] <szbalint> what was the old hardware like and what's the new hardware like?

[12:34] <Juerd> szbalint: Old: P4 2.8, 1 GB, 2*80 SATA

[12:34] <Juerd> szbalint: New: C2D 2.33, 4 GB, 3*120 SATA

[12:35] <szbalint> I see the improvement :)

[12:35] <Juerd> It runs xen now

[12:35] <Juerd> The semipublic part gets 2.5 GB ram

[12:35] <Juerd> And the more important stuff can be hosted on separate virtual machines for proper separation

[12:35] <Juerd> Things like the SVN repository.

[12:35] <Juerd> So they keep running if someone fscks the semipublic server up

[14:09] <Juerd> Luckily I used lvm for the rest of feather0, and could easily add a 5 GB filesystem for this during runtime

[16:03] <masak> in some sense, Perl will be 20 years this year

[16:04] <masak> dec 18

[16:04] <masak> there seems to be prior art in releasing perl versions by christmas :)

[16:05] *** cognominal_ left
[16:07] <Limbic_Region> masak - well, considering there are only 6 days after Xmas and 358 days before xmas, it is always a good chance perl will be released by/before xmas

[16:07] <masak> true

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> it is of course just a marketing ploy

[16:07] <masak> yes

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> larry has the highest chance of under promising and over delivering that way

[16:07] <masak> though I was using "by" in the sense "close to" here

[16:07] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[16:09] <Limbic_Region> well, to be honest I would have put money on THIS xmas if audreyt was still burning the candle with a flamethrower

[16:09] <Limbic_Region> I am glad she took a break

[16:09] <Limbic_Region> and I am also glad so much work has started happening outside of pugs directly

[16:10] <Limbic_Region> so I am likely going to make a public wager on xmas 2008

[16:13] <TimToady> and Perl will then be old enough to drink.  :)

[16:13] <Limbic_Region> champagne to celebrate

[16:14] <masak> Limbic_Region: you're the first one I hear describing audreyt's current state as "taking a break"

[16:14] <masak> maybe I ought to be less worried about her health than I am

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> masak - well, worrying is a useless emotion

[16:15] <Limbic_Region> if you meant concerned, then the concern is likely justified

[16:16] <Limbic_Region> I have only talked to her a few times and she seems to be positive

[16:16] <TimToady> Audrey must take good care of herself.  I'd much rather have Audrey alive and Perl dead than the other way around.

[16:16] <masak> Limbic_Region: my level of English permits me little distinction between "concerned" and "worried". the latter seemed a little more involved/active

[16:16] <szbalint> Agreed.

[16:17] <masak> TimToady: yes, of course

[16:17] <Limbic_Region> I think everyone here echos TimToady's sentiment

[16:18] *** amnesiac joined
[16:19] <Limbic_Region> perlbot .se

[16:19] <perlbot> .se is Sweden

[16:19] <Limbic_Region> masak - you're use of 'worry' versus 'concerned' was fine.  It is just a hang up I have.

[16:20] <masak> heh

[16:20] <masak> I'm not sure I understood the exact nature of you hang-up

[16:20] <Limbic_Region> masak - let me try and explain

[16:21] * masak lets Limbic_Region try to explain

[16:21] <Limbic_Region> typically, when I hear people say they are worried over something they mean that they are running scenarios over and over in their head and stressing out over what ifs and what not

[16:21] <masak> ok

[16:22] <TimToady> worry is generally construed as obsessive, while concern is not

[16:22] <Limbic_Region> right

[16:22] <Limbic_Region> obessive without outlet

[16:23] <masak> it might be a false friend due to my Swedish

[16:23] <masak> I think both "worried" and "concerned" map to the same word

[16:23] <Limbic_Region> no worries

[16:23] <masak> :)

[16:23] <Limbic_Region> I know that audreyt appreciates all of our well wishes and she has indicated that she misses us

[16:23] <szbalint> well at least as a non-native english my interpretation would be worried as a stronger version of concerned

[16:24] <masak> szbalint: yes, me too

[16:24] <szbalint> but of course my english is bad :)

[16:24] <masak> perhaps it's too strong for this occasion

[16:24] <masak> I'll have to adjust my intuition about the word

[16:24] <TimToady> "to worry" actually comes from middle English "to strangle"

[16:24] <masak> *lol*

[16:24] <TimToady> as what a dog does to its prey

[16:25] <TimToady> so it still has some violent overtones, though it has softened considerably

[16:25] <masak> now I will never be able to use the word again

[16:25] <TimToady> don't let it worry you.  :)

[16:25] <Limbic_Region> heh

[16:25] <masak> I'll just think about the dog strangling its prey

[16:26] <Juerd> Do dogs do that?

[16:26] <szbalint> heh that sentence, TimToady, sound much more comforting now :)

[16:26] <szbalint> *sounds

[16:27] <Juerd> For some reason, the new feather only reaches 75 Mb/s

[16:27] <Limbic_Region> masak - I see worry as an emotion that results in the person worrying undue physical and emotional detriment while not affecting the external situation of which they are obsessing about (i.e. obssession without outlet)

[16:27] <Juerd> It's enough, but I wonder why it isn't faster

[16:28] <Juerd> Limbic_Region: Would you say that concern is less emotional, more rational?

[16:28] <nwc10> 75 Mb/s of what?

[16:29] <Juerd> nwc10: Network traffic.

[16:29] <nwc10> ah

[16:30] <masak> Limbic_Region: sounds like "to worry" has a completely differend meaning than I attributed to it. more like Swedish "att älta" -- to mentally or verbally reprocess a past or future situation

[16:30] <Juerd> It's connected at 100 Mb/s, and it should reach at least 90

[16:30] <Juerd> But 10 would suffice too, in practice :)

[16:30] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - sort of.  What I like to do in a situation in which one might worry is run through the possibilities of an outcome I have no control.  Determine what I might do in each of the situations.  Determine if there is anything I can do to feel better about the situation (prayer, letting someone else know that I am ok, etc) then I rest

[16:31] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - I still may have extreme feelings and emotions but I stop the process when it is no longer of any benefit

[16:31] *** cognominal_ joined
[16:31] <Limbic_Region> that doesn't mean I stop feeling the way I do - just that I don't let it overwhelm me
