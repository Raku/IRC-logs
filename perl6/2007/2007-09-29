[09:31] <masak> I'm back to leafing through the pugs tests, finding simple things to fix

[09:32] <masak> I have some questions about the `proto` keyword

[09:32] <masak> is it relatively fresh in the spec? how much does pugs implement it?

[09:53] *** penk left
[09:55] <masak> S06 doesn't have much to say about protos that's applicable here

[09:55] <masak> I'll put together a nopaste which specifies my question

[10:03] <pasteling> "masak" at 130.238.45.242 pasted "a bit of struggling with proto subs -- 'd be happy for directions" (43 lines, 1.2K) at http://sial.org/pbot/27785

[10:06] *** iblechbot left
[10:10] <masak> S06 doesn't seem to mention that the "proto" keyword is used to predeclare subs

[10:11] <masak> either I got that wrong, or it's in some other synopsis, or it should be added

[10:16] <pmurias> masak: i think the fully implemented version wasn't declared at that moment

[10:16] <masak> pmurias: it wasn't

[10:16] <pmurias> so pugs invokes the default proto implementation

[10:17] <masak> this all seems vaguely dangerous

[10:17] <pmurias> it's a bug :)

[10:17] <masak> it's not what I expect at all

[10:17] <masak> thank gosh

[10:17] <pmurias> the code snippet at the top should also work

[10:17] <masak> oh

[10:17] <masak> no proto needed anywhere?

[10:18] <pmurias> only if you do multis

[10:18] <masak> ah

[10:18] <masak> then I'll take back that thing about S06 needing an update

[10:18] <masak> though I did head TimToady++ say the other day that things cannot be called that weren't declared already

[10:19] <masak> but maybe that only goes for things without the & sigil

[10:20] <pmurias> masak: proto is descriped also in S12

[10:22] <Aankhen``> Does KP6 just handle signatures as lists of variables?

[10:22] <masak> pmurias: a provisional call being a call from a sub declared before the called sub?

[10:23] <pmurias> pmurias: call of a sub

[10:23] <pmurias> Aankhen``: look into Grammar/Sub.pm

[10:24] <pmurias> the AST represents the as ::Sig

[10:24] *** drrho left
[10:25] <pmurias> Aankhen``: token sig in Grammar.pm does the parsing

[10:26] <Aankhen``> Ah, it's in Grammar.pm.  I was wondering where it popped up from. :-)

[13:57] <Aankhen``> pmu: Subversion does support changing the commit message as a property, actually, but there's all sorts of gotchas and the repository has to have certain hooks enabled.

[13:58] <Aankhen``> Whoops.

[13:59] *** rhizo joined
[14:01] <allbery_b> huh, I thought commit messages were non-versioned properties, no special hooks needed

[14:03] <lambdabot> Title: subversion: Subversion FAQ

[14:04] <allbery_b> ah, ok

[16:15] <pmurias> Aankhen``: the ability to change the commit msg is restricted to the repo admin, because it can cause data loss, but if it was a versioned propery then it could be more avalible

[16:18] <allbery_b> svn versioning doesn't work that way sadly

[16:18] <pmurias> S03 uses the words "Match is a kind of Capture", does it mean a subclass of Capture

[16:19] <pmurias> allbery_b: do you know why>

[16:19] <pmurias> ?

[16:19] <masak> pmurias: without evidence to the contrary, I'd say Match isa Capture

[16:19] <allbery_b> pmurias: think about it.  versioning is tied to revisions.  if the revision's commit message is itself versioned, then is a commit message change part of the revision or is changing it a new revision?

[16:19] <pmurias> masak: thanks

[16:20] <masak> I don't think Larry would write "is a kind of" without thinking of subclassing

[16:20] <allbery_b> it's a chicken-or-egg situation

[17:48] <rhr> TimToady: is the :my $x; syntax used recently in STD Real Perl (I don't see anything in S05) or part of the cheating?

[17:50] *** hakobe is now known as hkb_zz

[17:50] <TimToady> I believe it is likely to end up real, but likely with some restrictions on just where you can put it

[17:51] <TimToady> since the order of the regex is not necessarily the order of the code that results

[17:52] <TimToady> one can implement /a b/ as (match a).map: { match b } or map { match b }, match a

[17:52] <TimToady> and I've had it both ways already, and several other ways.  :)

[17:53] <TimToady> I like the :my syntax better than, say, <my ...>

[17:53] *** rindolf joined
[17:53] <TimToady> since it's not an assertion, and :foo influences the subsequent lexical scope anyway
