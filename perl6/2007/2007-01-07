[00:01] <luqui> ahh, that's why you were resistant

[00:01] <luqui> you could go to MAGnet #perl (that's the main #perl channel)

[00:01] <luqui> I think it lives at irc.perl.org

[00:02] <dduncan> what's the relation between MAGnet and irc.perl.org ?

[00:03] <luqui> I think they are the same

[00:03] <luqui> I'm not sure

[00:03] <dduncan> I would just refer to it by the irc.perl.org name

[00:03] <luqui> probably a wise idea

[00:08] <johnjra> luqui: what do you understand by resistant ?

[00:08] <luqui> pardon?

[00:08] <luqui> do you mean what do I mean by that?

[00:09] <Limbic_Region> luqui - don't know if you remember a conversation we had on gmail chat but I told you that you wouldn't be gone from perl 6 for long

[00:09] <Limbic_Region> :-D

[00:09] <Limbic_Region> s/told/predicted/

[00:09] <luqui> I think I remember

[00:09] <luqui> :-)

[00:10] <Limbic_Region> out of curiosity, is there an online way to see the latest commits now that we are using a new repo or is that feature unimplemented?

[00:11] <Limbic_Region> ?seen audreyt

[00:11] <lambdabot> audreyt is in #perl6, #ghc and #haskell. I don't know when audreyt last spoke.

[00:11] <Limbic_Region> has she still been mostly offlinish?

[00:12] * Limbic_Region has been on vacation for 3 weeks and unplugged

[00:12] <johnjra> are there projects that i can contribute to? in perl i mean ?

[00:13] <Limbic_Region> johnjra - perl 5 or perl 6

[00:13] <luqui> johnjra, what do you know?

[00:13] <johnjra> Limbic_Region: doesnt matter to me

[00:13] <luqui> (and even if nothing related to programming, there are things you can do)

[00:13] <johnjra> luqui: i know C/C++,i used to know asm/reverse engeneering,i know some math,a little perl

[00:14] <Limbic_Region> well - phalanx is still going strong from what I know

[00:14] <Limbic_Region> that is a good perl 5 project to work on

[00:14] <luqui> johnjra, if you like C, you can work on parrot

[00:14] <luqui> (the virtual machine for perl 6)

[00:16] <johnjra> wuts phalanx ?

[00:17] <johnjra> and by working on projects in perl i meant projects written in perl,not working on languages perl-like,or even perl,jut written in perl

[00:18] <luqui> ahh

[00:19] <johnjra> so ? 

[00:19] <luqui> I don't really know of any

[00:19] <johnjra> well that is sad

[00:19] <luqui> (except perl 6 is getting to the point where we are writing it in perl)

[00:19] <luqui> you should look at phalanx, I guess

[07:55] <TimToady_> complete rethink of smartmatching along lines of luqui's suggestion now posted to p6l (as spec!)

[07:56] *** TimToady_ is now known as TimToady

[07:57] <TimToady> s/luqui's/luqui++'s/  :)

[08:22] <gaal> is there anywhere in Perl 6 that "Code:($)" is a valid expression?

[08:22] <gaal> presumably meaning .does(Code) && .sig ~~ :($)

[08:25] <rindolf> Hi TimToady, gaal 

[08:27] <Kattana> hmm I like Patterns.

[08:29] <gaal> hello rindolf 

[08:29] <Kattana> If that rethink gets implimented I just might have to figure out p6 to try it, I am working a alternative regex.

[08:33] *** aufrank left
[08:34] <dduncan> I tell you, that smartmatch stuff is really maturing ... it seems

[08:41] <TimToady> gaal: dunno if that'll be a legal shorthand.  we do have &foo:(Int,Str) to get a reference to a particular multi, or set of multies.

[08:42] <TimToady> but of course "Code" can't be the basis for such a search.

[08:43] <TimToady> anyway, it was convenient shorthand for the table...

[08:44] <gaal> nodnod

[08:44] <gaal> just wondering :)

[08:44] <TimToady> really we could just call everything as :($) except that :() would fail if we tried to pass $_ to it.

[08:48] <TimToady> arguably if you supply a Code with :($,$) etc we should call it as .(|$_) to try to feed it multiple args.

[08:49] <TimToady> but we an always just have a single parameter of [$a,$b] for that case

[08:50] <TimToady> or declare a capture parameter and deal with it ourselves in the sub.

[08:51] <TimToady> on the other hand Code:($,$) *can't* match unless we | the $_ so maybe we just should dwim it for arity > 1

[08:53] <TimToady> or maybe we should reserve it for pulling multiple values off a for list depending on which sig binds... hmm...

[08:56] <TimToady> we need some general way of saying "match this signature against the capture, pull out everything that got bound, and leave the capture containing what's unbound."

[08:57] <TimToady> when * -> $a, $b, $c, *  {...} is almost beautiful...

[08:58] <TimToady> sub foo ($a, $b, *) {...}; foo(1,2,3,4,5);  # ignores 3,4,5

[08:59] <TimToady> not sure if $cap = \(1,2,3,4,5); foo(|$cap) would successfully leave 3,4,5 in $cap though...

[09:00] <TimToady> heh "foolscap"

[09:02] <TimToady> or splatty parameters in general could leave themselves in the input, which would let us bind to a lookahead parameter in a list:

[09:02] <TimToady> for @foo -> $this, *$next { if $this ne $next {...} }

[09:04] <TimToady> for 1..5 -> $this, *@rest { say @rest } # says 2345 345 45 5

[14:26] <Juerd> "Well, we're in 2007 now.   Perl6 still isn't finished and if you take a look at the discussions it pretty obvious that it has a loooong

[14:26] <Juerd> way to go.   The people working on it (at least some of them) are pretty smart -- that they can't make progress is an indication that

[14:26] <Juerd> the language is too complicated and early decisions were ill-informed.

[14:26] <Juerd> No one wanted parrot, we wanted simple, well-understood, mainstream language features like functions with named parameter lists.

[14:26] <Juerd> Against my better judgment, on the advice of a true believer I've been waiting five years for Perl 6.  No more.  Larry Wall promised us

[14:27] <Juerd> something by Christmas but all we've had is silence.

[14:27] <Juerd> It's time to throw in the towel guys.  Cut your losses, add a few badly needed features to Perl 5, call it Perl 6, and be done with it.

[14:27] <Juerd> I wish I could make this come across better; the Perl 6 people are a bright bunch trying to do a great thing, but it just isn't

[15:47] <masak> Juerd: I think it's sad and to be expected at the same time

[15:48] <masak> frankly, I'm also a bit confused by the "by christmas" thing

[15:49] <masak> I would have expected someone in perl6 circles to have made something of the situation

[15:49] <Juerd> I think it's a bloody shame that we as a Perl 6 community fail to communicate the progress to the outside world, but I don't have any ideas for improvement.

[15:49] <masak> what I didn't expect was Christmas and then nothing at all

[15:49] <masak> "nothing" as in "no significant release which could be called 'perl6 alpha'"

[15:50] * masak is still hopeful, but understands the impatient reactions from people on the outside

[15:50] <Juerd> Well, I guess momentum's a bit gone

[15:50] <masak> Juerd: that's what I was thinking just a few minutes ago when I went to get some hot chocolate

[15:51] <masak> how to reintroduce the spirit of Feb 2004?

[15:51] <masak> if I could be even a small part of doing that, it would be worth it for me

[15:51] <masak> just to see pugs get rolling again

[15:51] <Juerd> Well, I'm a business guy. I can only think of hiring people, but there's no money :)

[15:52] <Juerd> Motivating people is hard if there's just internet communication.

[15:52] <masak> when pugs is moving along with the synopses, everything else is so mych fun and spirited

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> masak - from the pugs perspective, finding the right catalyst isn't going to be easy

[15:52] <masak> Juerd: how many people besides audreyt have been known to actively hack on the pugs compiler itself?

[15:52] <Limbic_Region> originally, nothing of the spec was implemented so there was a lot to do

[15:53] <masak> Limbic_Region: isn't there still a lot to do?

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> now, a lot of the spec is implemented so now a lot of projects are experiments

[15:53] <Juerd> masak: I don't know. TBH, I haven't been following Pugs development since half 2004.

[15:53] *** buetow joined
[15:53] <masak> hm

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> masak - yes, but it isn't so tangible

[15:53] <masak> Limbic_Region: maybe all the low-hanging fruit has been implemented

[15:53] <Limbic_Region> what would be incredibly stimulating is to invigorate the perl6 -> parrot via pugs project

[15:54] <masak> what I would like to do, more and more, is actually to get a hold of audreyt and interview her about the evolution of pugs

[15:54] <Limbic_Region> and that is the path that I think is being taken

[15:54] <masak> the different stages that the compiler has gone through

[15:54] *** nipra joined
[15:54] <Limbic_Region> but I have been out of the loop for the past 3+ weeks

[15:54] <Juerd> What's holding me back is the lack of real world examples that actually do something, and aren't limited by Pugs's capabilities.

[15:54] <masak> I think that would help me understand pugs better

[15:54] <Limbic_Region> and from what I can tell, audreyt has been mostly too

[15:54] <masak> Limbic_Region: yes

[15:55] <Juerd> It should be easy to derive from Array and build your own implementation. But so far, nobody knows how.

[15:55] <masak> she was here the other day though, backlogging

[15:55] <Juerd> It should be easy to change the grammar and add your own dialect lexically. But how?

[15:55] <masak> Juerd: that's another thing -- the status documents are out of synch

[15:55] * Limbic_Region AFK &

[15:55] <masak> basically, they fall behind when nobody's doing any coding

[15:56] <Juerd> A lot of things could use images for better documentation, easier understanding. There are very few.

[15:56] <Juerd> But the fundamental problem is man power.

[15:56] <masak> Juerd: yes

[15:56] <Juerd> Who has the time to do all this?

[15:57] <Juerd> I'm whining about it, but I'm not solving any of it myself.

[15:57] <masak> I liked that JANITORS file idea

[15:57] <Juerd> And that's true for dozens of people.

[15:57] <masak> wherein small tasks requiring little previous knowledge could be put down

[15:57] <masak> and done by people with time

[15:58] <Juerd> Another problem for me personally is that Perl 6 has become so complex that I can no longer grok it. Whenever something is discussed on IRC, people need to point me to the right synopses constantly.

[15:59] <Juerd> Every little thing makes sense by itself, but sometimes I think we would be better off with less complexity in the language, even if that adds complexity elsewhere.

[15:59] *** vamo joined
[15:59] <Juerd> masak: You mean that people with time still exist? :)

[16:00] <Juerd> (It's not just time, though. You also need tuits. Procastrination takes you nowherre.)

[16:00] * Juerd is pessimistic about the entire thing. Probably more than he should be.

[16:02] <masak> Juerd: I have time, sometimes

[16:03] <masak> not tuits right now, though

[16:03] <masak> right now I think what would be most needed is a "fresh start"

[16:03] <Juerd> What kind of a fresh start?

[16:04] <masak> someone coming up with something nice which everyone can gawk at, and then saying "come on"

[16:04] <masak> "let's do more of this cool stuff"

[16:04] <masak> sort of like audreyt used to do with her blog entries

[16:04] * masak misses audreyt's blog entries

[16:04] * Juerd too

[16:05] <Juerd> I wonder why all these projects halt when Audrey's gone.

[16:05] <Juerd> Look at feather's system load right now... 0.40; it's been at 25 because so many people were working on Pugs at the same time

[16:06] <masak> she's the spirited soul that keeps the machinery together

[16:06] <Juerd> Certainly

[16:06] <masak> if she were to come back now, before two hours we would have active development again

[16:07] <masak> question is: could someone else do the same thing? hack on pugs and invigorate people? hardly

[20:49] <MaenNJ> hi all

[20:50] <MaenNJ> guys, is there any website that gives little details about how perl6 implemented in pugs ?

[20:51] <MaenNJ> for example, the run-time representation of variables

[20:55] <wolverian> did you check the docs/ dir? and the source is always there :)

[20:58] <MaenNJ> should I know haskell to be able to read the source ?

[21:03] <wolverian> depends on how well versed you are in, say, ML, or another language (or maths) that helps. if you aren't, you'll probably want to learn haskell. it won't take too long, really.
