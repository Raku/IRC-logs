[00:00] <TimToady> and the easiest way to implement it is by really doing a lookbehind.  but that implies reversing the pattern

[00:00] <dmq> especially when you already have nfrastructure in place to do a BM for 'bar' it should really look for 'foobar' as it mean BM can go faster

[00:00] <dmq> well japhy's \K sorts it somewhat.

[00:01] <dmq> iow: /foo\Kbar/

[00:01] <TimToady> what does that do?

[00:01] <dmq> it updates starp[0] to be the current position.

[00:02] <dmq> so you can do variable length lookbehind using it

[00:03] *** CardinalNumber is now known as ProperNoun

[00:03] <dmq> for instance /(?:fnorble)*\Kbar/ is the equivelent of /(?<=(fnorble)*)bar/

[00:04] <dmq> its useful for things like s/foo\kbar/baz/;

[00:04] <dmq> about 10 times faster than s/(foo)bar/${1}baz/

[00:05] *** Limbic_Region joined
[00:05] <TimToady> okay, it's equiv to <( in P6

[00:05] <TimToady> do you have an equiv for )> as well?

[00:05] <lambdabot> Title: Regexp::Keep - filter to allow the \K escape in regexes - search.cpan.org

[00:08] <dmq> well japhy talked about a \F for "forsake" which  might be )>

[00:08] <dmq> but i didnt do it.

[00:09] <dmq> well i tried, but it caused all kinds of problems and since lookahead allows variable width i thought it was no loss.

[00:09] *** IllvilJa joined
[00:10] <dduncan> TimToady, regarding the list of data types in Synopsis 2, there seem to be a number of supporting types missing from the list, but I would think that logically they should be formally shown there

[00:10] <TimToady> it should be just as easy to set the end position as the start position in terms of internals.   It's just an implicit capture, more or less.

[00:10] <dduncan> for one thing, the data type that represents the length of a Str

[00:10] <dmq> japhys original patch: http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-07/msg01380.html

[00:10] <lambdabot> Title: Forwarded attachment..., http://tinyurl.com/2xbpbn

[00:10] <dduncan> for another, the data type that represents an Order (it has 3 values, afaik)

[00:11] *** Lectus joined
[00:11] <dduncan> such as those should be in the Immutable types list

[00:11] <dmq> timtoady: there were all kinds of hairy interactions with pos, and s/// and stuff that i decided i didnt want to spend more time on it than i did.

[00:11] <dduncan> the length of a Str isn't an Int, and I recall you said you had a special type for it, called Length or something

[00:11] <dduncan> or Str::Length

[00:11] <TimToady> StrLen I think

[00:12] <TimToady> and StrPos

[00:12] <TimToady> you get a StrLen when you subtract two StrPos

[00:12] <dduncan> yes ... such as these should be in the types list

[00:12] <dduncan> formally

[00:12] <TimToady> even informally in the types list would be an improvement.  :)

[00:12] <dduncan> yes

[00:12] <dduncan> and Order too, or whatever its called

[00:13] <TimToady> Ordering, or Ordered, or some such

[00:13] <dduncan> that <=> returns

[00:13] <dduncan> yes

[00:13] <TimToady> yeah, the enum

[00:13] <TimToady> and the role that goes with

[00:13] <TimToady> probably need to start a separate list for standard roles

[00:14] <dduncan> good idea

[00:14] <TimToady> though a goodly number of the builtin types are class/role puns to begin with, I suspect.

[00:15] <dduncan> but they should still all be listed in one place for reference

[00:15] <TimToady> well, eventually you run into the fuzzy boundary between standard and pretty nearly almost standard

[00:16] <dmq> btw timtoady you can do crazy stuff like /(foo|\Kbar)*/ 

[00:16] <dduncan> on a tangent, at one point some of your examples showed data types for representing one byte and one character respectively ... I can see that having a Char etc type would be useless, but are both of those now gone?

[00:16] <TimToady> that's just / ( foo | <( bar )* / in P6

[00:17] <TimToady> <( and )> aren't actually required to balance

[00:17] <dmq> oh, i didnt realize /that/

[00:17] <dmq> nice.

[00:17] <TimToady> mind, it'll confuse the heck out of your syntax highligher... :/

[00:17] <dmq> yes, then \K is <(, but )> is the \F i couldnt get working. sorry.

[00:18] <TimToady> I do think the relationship between <( and )> is a bit more apparent.  :)

[00:18] <dmq> yeah well.

[00:18] <dmq> :-)

[00:18] <TimToady> maybe you should just implement a /p6 option.  :)

[00:19] *** demq joined
[00:19] <TimToady> just like P6 has a :P5 option.

[00:19] <demq> well its sorta possible via a plugin engine.

[00:19] <demq> i believe thats what avar is working on

[00:20] <demq> but modifiers are evil.

[00:20] <TimToady> then (?P6)  :)

[00:20] <demq> i changed the order of the modifiers generated when stringifying a regex and all hell broke loose.

[00:20] <demq> maybe (+....)

[00:20] <demq> :-)

[00:21] <avar> demq: If I ever sort out my stupid bugs:)

[00:21] <avar> dmq++ made some changes which makes thing easy, wee:)

[00:21] *** Lectus left
[00:22] <demq> oh, dont do $^H{regcomp}=0

[00:22] <demq> delete the key.

[00:24] <demq> r->extflags = pm->op_pmflags; /* the hell is this? ==>  & RXf_PMf_COMPILETIME;*/

[00:24] <demq> lol

[00:24] <avar> haha

[00:24] <avar> it was something that was in PCRE which I started out ripping off

[00:25] <avar> I have found that it server no useful function in my case:)

[00:25] <demq> ok, look, in re->extflags you can only use RXf_FLAGS

[00:26] <demq> but 5 bits of extflags are shared with the PMOP so have the prefix: RXf_PMf_

[00:26] <demq> and have PMf_ equivelents too.

[00:26] <demq> and this is the perl6 channel.

[00:26] <demq> whoops.

[00:27] <avar> heh:)

[00:27] * demq bops over to #p5p so as not to bore anybody

[00:31] *** cjeris left
[00:34] <Limbic_Region> join #p5p

[00:34] <Limbic_Region> heh

[00:35] <dduncan> TimToady, it occurs to me that with things like StrPos and StrLen, it may not be possible to treat them as normal data types, as values of normal types have meaning in isolation, but it occurs to me that StrPos and StrLen may only have meaning in the context of a particular Str value ... eg, a StrPos or StrLen may only make sense for a specific sequence of graphemes or codepoints or whatever

[00:35] <dduncan> if so, then StrLen|StrPos is more like a reference type, that points to a container specifically

[00:36] <dduncan> except that StrLen|StrPos will work with any appearance of the same Str value

[00:38] <dduncan> I say this because, unlike units like of spacial length or time or temperature or velocity etc in standard contexts, where differing units can be converted between each other at a fixed ratio, the ratio of eg graphemes to codepoints isn't fixed, and depends on what specific graphemes or chars there are

[00:40] <dduncan> on the other hand, if StrLen or StrPos simply means "a length in graphemes OR a length in codepoints etc", then that probably would work as a normal data type

[00:40] <dduncan> such that StrPos then is simply a disjunction type

[00:42] <dduncan> is that how it is?

[00:44] <dduncan> In any event, I suggest you specifically say whether StrLen|StrPos is such a disjunctive type, which has meaning in isolation, or whether it just has meaning in context of a Str because the graphemes|codepoints are just projected views of the internal value

[05:47] <brad__> hi

[05:48] <PerlJam> hello

[05:48] <brad__> just lurking hoping to pick up some amusing info on perl6

[05:48] <brad__> and maybe chat with some perl6 luminaries

[05:49] <brad__> or is it just us?

[05:49] <nothingmuch> so this one time a cabal member walked into a bar

[05:49] <nothingmuch> and the bartender asked "do you have a commit bit?"

[05:49] <nothingmuch> along those lines?

[05:50] <brad__> sure, pass the pretzels

[05:50] <brad__> will perl6 support any concept of lazy evaluation?

[05:50] <nothingmuch> yes

[05:50] <brad__> interesting

[05:50] <nothingmuch> my $var = lazy { moose() };

[05:50] <nothingmuch> for scsalars

[05:50] <nothingmuch> lists are lazy by default

[05:51] <PerlJam> brad__: perl6 is all about the lazy

[05:51] <nothingmuch> you can unlazify lists, see s04 i think

[05:51] <brad__> would love to see lots of haskell goodness in perl6

[05:51] <brad__> i like haskell but am sorta hardwired into perl after many years

[05:51] <nothingmuch> http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S02.html#Lists

[05:51] <PerlJam> brad__: same here.

[05:51] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 2: Bits and Pieces - perl6:

[05:52] <brad__> well lambdabot is here, so i know haskell is influencing!

[05:52] <PerlJam> I tried haskell for a while in the early days of pugs, but I quickly slipped back to my perlian roots

[05:53] <brad__> i am still trying to make a go of it in haskell

[05:53] <nothingmuch> good nicht

[05:53] <brad__> immature libraries are an issue...we take things like dbi for granted

[05:53] <PerlJam> gut Nacht

[05:53] <PerlJam> :-)

[05:53] <nothingmuch> @google antibuddha

[05:53] <brad__> bye

[05:53] <lambdabot> Title: Index of /darcs/antibuddha

[05:53] <PerlJam> brad__: you mean for perl6?

[05:54] <PerlJam> brad__: or are you still talking about haskell?

[05:54] <brad__> well i meant the lack of a good stable database interface in haskell

[05:54] <brad__> there a like three, all sorta beta quality

[05:54] <nothingmuch> oops, good *night*

[05:54] <PerlJam> create a perl linkage and borrow DBI then

[05:55] <nothingmuch> i didn't realize my silly typo, thanks PerlJam ;-)

[05:55] <nothingmuch> anyway, ciao guys

[05:55] <brad__> bye

[05:55] <PerlJam> later nothingmuch (have a nice sleep (or whatever you do at night :-))

[05:56] <nothingmuch> excercise now

[05:56] <nothingmuch> shower soon

[05:56] <nothingmuch> sleep after

[05:56] <PerlJam> brad__: pugs is full of code that knows how to deal with perl5 or parrot or other stuff so that pugs can use them natively.  If it's good enough for pugs, that same technique can be used with "ordinary" haskell

[05:57] <brad__> i suppose

[05:57] <brad__> i haven't played with pugs for so long

[05:57] <brad__> i wonder if there will ever be another release

[05:57] <brad__> or if it has come time to focus on perl6 on parrot

[05:58] <brad__> not that these efforts are mutually exclusive

[05:58] <brad__> i desperately want to be able to download a perl6-0.0.1.ta.gz

[05:58] <PerlJam> Well ... given that Larry has been writing the perl 6 grammar in perl 6, we'll kind of need something that can do something useful with it if we're to bootstrap ourselves to a "real" perl 6

[05:59] <PerlJam> whether that's pugs or parrot or something else entirely, who knows?

[05:59] <brad__> hopefully that will resolve itself in 2007

[06:00] <brad__> well its too late for "something else entirely", i presume that parrot is the deal

[06:00] <brad__> is larry ever in here? i would like to virtually meet him one day

[06:00] <PerlJam> I'm expecting a useful perl6-on-parrot this year and a useful-for-ordinary-people perl6-on-parrot next year.

[06:01] <brad__> well that is great news

[06:01] <brad__> i will definitely jump on anything that gets released

[06:01] <PerlJam> brad__: larry is usually here during US Pacific day time

[06:01] <brad__> ah, well i should try during the day

[06:02] <PerlJam> And what makes you think it's too late for "something else"?

[06:02] <brad__> well, just inertia. while people say "something else" is possible, no one really seems to be venturing out in a new direction (or are they?)

[06:02] <PerlJam> pugs came together rather quickly from near nothing.  Someone else could do that again :)

[06:03] <brad__> and since parrot seems viable, i am not entirely sure what the point would be

[06:03] <brad__> not that there has to be a "point"

[06:03] <PerlJam> I'm still betting on parrot fwiw :)

[06:03] <brad__> whatever happened to audrey? i used to see lots of posts and presentations and such

[06:03] <brad__> then nothing

[06:04] <brad__> not that she is on a schedule to amuse us

[06:04] <PerlJam> I don't know ... I've been mostly out of things for several months myself.

[06:05] <brad__> are you a perl luminary hiding behind an irc name?

[06:05] <PerlJam> nope, just a long-time perl user.

[06:05] <brad__> me too

[06:05] <brad__> about eleven years

[06:05] <PerlJam> 15 for me in the summer.

[06:05] <brad__> cool. when i started, perl5 was "beta"

[06:06] <brad__> it really blew me away at the time

[06:06] <brad__> still does

[06:06] <PerlJam> perl6 will do that too  :-)

[06:06] *** Daveman joined
[06:06] <brad__> things i take for granted now like context-sensitive evaluation...tres cool!

[06:08] <brad__> it will be neat to see how high parrot implementation can crawl up the "great programming language shootout" list

[06:08] <brad__> i have always thought parrot would be the best choice for a dynamic runtime for firefox

[06:08] <brad__> why should i have to use js?!?!

[06:09] <PerlJam> parrot needs to achieve ubiquity in browsers and webservers IMHO

[06:10] <brad__> agreed, although it will be tough, the mozilla.org people are stuck on tamarin (the next js runtime), and they have no interest in language neutrality

[06:10] *** kanru joined
[06:10] <Coke_> whoa, parrot seems viable?!

[06:23] <allbery_b> er, lots of us

[06:23] * allbery_b should really be in bed...

[06:24] <brad_> i have "a haskell study plan" open in a screen split pane right now!

[06:25] <allbery_b> I'mnot much more than a beginner myself, I've figured out monads but often miss that I can use functors instead :)

[06:27] <brad_> i pretty much wedged on functors

[06:27] <brad_> i know what it is when i read it, thats it thought

[06:27] <brad_> not sure i actually need to know that part

[06:27] <brad_> just like in perl, i sorta know what i need to know, not everything

[06:27] <allbery_b> functors are the step below monads, and are simpler; I'm paying the price for hopping right over them on the way

[06:28] <allbery_b> but functors vs. monads are part of haskell

[06:28] <allbery_b> s version of TIMTOWTDI

[06:28] <brad_> thats what i figure

[06:28] <brad_> haskell is sort of like perl, you can get away with a lot without knowing the deep stuff

[06:29] <allbery_b> some of the deep stuff you don't have to know at all.  the mathy types often wank about category theory, butwhile monads were taken from category theory you don't really need to know anything about them even for complex monad usage

[06:30] <allbery_b> @go you could have invented monads

[06:30] <lambdabot> Title: A Neighborhood of Infinity: You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Alrea ...

[06:30] <brad_> yeah, i pretty much stop reading haskell-cafe posts when they go too far down that route

[06:30] <allbery_b> good article on how to work out monads without getting anywhere near the fancy maths

[06:30] <brad_> just no need and frankly no time and likely not smart enough anyway

[06:31] <allbery_b> I read them in the vague hope that some of it'll stick, but I'm funny that way

[06:31] <allbery_b> do a lot of learning by osmosis, always have

[06:33] <brad_> haskell-cafe has some gems, mostly crap though, like any mailing list

[06:33] <brad_> wonder if there is a perl6 equivalent

[06:34] <allbery_b> perl6-users but it doesn't have a lot of traffic as yet

[06:34] <brad_> i will dive in as soon as i think the syntax is settled

[06:35] <brad_> i tried making a deep dive about a year ago, but when i realized how fast the target was moving, decided i had better things to do than chase a moving target

[06:35] *** Aankhen`` joined
[06:35] <allbery_b> well, it looks like it's finally starting to settle, lwall is starting to push some stuff past 6.0, implying that he's targeting a 6.0-release

[06:36] <brad_> ah, so he is going to let some features slip?

[06:36] <brad_> to try to nail down the 6.0 featureset?

[06:36] *** rfordinal_ is now known as rfordinal

[06:36] <PerlJam> He's going to let some 

[06:36] <PerlJam> He's going to let some "features" go where they belong -- in modules

[06:37] <allbery_b> I was thinking of ;-syntax for MMD

[06:37] <PerlJam> But the syntax has settled down quite a bit.

[06:37] <brad_> mmd?

[06:37] <PerlJam> even though there have been a few minor changes in the last month or so

[06:37] <allbery_b> multiparameter method dispatch

[06:37] <brad_> ah

[06:37] <brad_> maybe i should dig up the apocalypses again

[06:38] <brad_> if they are actually stable at this point

[06:38] <allbery_b> the apocalypses are frozen.  and as such, very out of date

[06:38] <allbery_b> the synopses are where it's at

[06:38] <brad_> oh, then what are the design docs?

[06:39] <brad_> AH

[06:39] <brad_> i confused the two

[06:39] <brad_> and lets not forget the exegesi or whatever

[06:39] <allbery_b> the acopalypses are the initial thinking about the design, saved for posterity

[06:39] <brad_> the synopsi catted together seem like they are destined to be the next perldocs

[06:40] <allbery_b> the exegeses are later thinking about what the apocalypses mean

[06:40] <allbery_b> the synopses are the actual design

[06:40] <allbery_b> and yes, they're at least a skjeleton for the pods.  but rather incomplete as yet, for that

[06:41] <allbery_b> and lwall changed at least 3 synopses just today, so it's far from frozen just yet

[06:42] <PerlJam> most of the recent changes are minorish semantic changes.  The syntax hasn't changed (much :)

[06:42] <allbery_b> yeh

[06:42] * allbery_b really needs to go to bed, approaching 2am here and he's ready to fall over.  'night

[06:43] <PerlJam> good night allbery_b

[17:49] <TimToady> anyway, before I wander off, did anyone have any questions about Perl 6 (the language aspiring to be the perfect joke)?

[17:50] <kolibrie> TimToady: I did have one question about that 'for' loop with an if in it, from yesterday

[17:50] <kolibrie> does that make it act like grep?

[17:50] <TimToady> yes, grep is just another list comprehension syntax.

[17:51] <kolibrie> that's what I thought, but it was not obvious, so I thought I'd better check

[17:51] <TimToady> except grep is limited to returning the exact values it got, and the more general forms can return something related instead.

[18:23] <Coke_> TimToady: I had a question.

[18:23] <Coke_> in tcl, you can set a proc to fire when entering or leaving a user defined procedure. In perl6, looks like PRE and POST are the hooks here. is there a way to specify this *after* the sub is declared?

[18:24] *** neonse joined
[18:24] <Coke_> also, in tcl, you can additionally have something fire before/after each *line* of the sub. any interest in that level of granularity for Perl 6?

[18:24] <Coke_> (in tcl, you can't do any of this when you define the sub, you have to tack it on.)

[18:24] *** sunnavy joined
[18:44] <jdv79> is there anything like java's annotations in p6?

[18:45] *** awwaiid joined
[18:50] *** bonesss joined
[18:50] *** justatheory joined
[18:51] <TimToady> I'm not familiar with java's annotations

[18:51] <TimToady> PRE and POST and all the other blocks are just traits that can be modified

[18:51] <TimToady> though you might just want ENTER and LEAVE blocks unless you're doing DBC

[18:52] <TimToady> the line-by-line stuff sounds like something that should have to be declared in advance as a pessimization.

[18:53] <TimToady> either that, or the run-time has to pessimize the code when you supply such a property, and that potentially poses problems if some code is running optimized versions already.

[18:55] <TimToady> though for at least some kinds of code it doesn't matter if you're running two different code paths

[18:55] <TimToady> I can imagine some optimizations that depend on outside invariants that the pessimization might vary though.

[19:08] <TimToady> it would be rather unfortunate if the optimized and pessimized versions kept a given state variable in two different places, for instance.

[19:09] <jdv79> sorta gotcha, thanks

[19:09] <TimToady> but we probably have to solve this for using a debugger anyway...

[19:12] <dmq> timtoady: it just occured to me, if the [ in <+[ is mandatory, then i dont have to change the meaning of (?+ or (?- since for it to be relative goto/recursion it would have to be numeric.

[19:12] <[particle]> dmq: you can add with named rules, too, not just charclasses

[19:12] <[particle]> eg: <+foo-[abc]>

[19:13] <dmq> is that relevent in p5 tho?

[19:13] <dmq> is there an equivelent p5 structure id need to use?

[19:13] <[particle]> you said <+[, i assumed you meant p6

[19:14] <dmq> trying to make p5's forthcoming enhanced class syntax as close as possible to p6.

[19:14] <dmq> (? in p5 is < in p6

[19:14] <[particle]> identifiers can't start with a number

[19:15] <dmq> btw, wasnt trying to be snarky. it was an honest question.

[19:15] <dmq> oh sweet.

[19:15] <dmq> yay i dont have to worry about changing (?+1) then 

[19:15] <dmq> cool.

[19:16] <[particle]> (?+...) is now a multimethod :)

[19:17] <dmq> ah.

[19:17] <diotalevi> multimethods for everyone!

[19:17] <dmq> so since (?+[ is unambiguous, i can use it, as well as (?[...]) and (?-[...]) for extended char classes. whee!

[19:17] <[particle]> it's a bit confusing, but there are more confusing things in perl 5

[19:18] <diotalevi> :-) btw, I think I'm going to make that ref/defined multimethod promoting thing into Acme::Builtin::Multimethod just because I don't want anyone to expect me to support it.

[22:35] <Limbic_Region> out of curiosity, anyone here use oz/motzart/alice ?

[22:36] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: what are they?

[22:37] <Limbic_Region> they are programming languages

[22:38] <Limbic_Region> primary interest is concurrency and constraints

[22:38] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I see.

[22:38] <rindolf> First time I recall hearing of them.

[22:40] <Limbic_Region> diotalevi turned me on to them

[22:40] <Limbic_Region> I was thinking of prolog but it sounds like these are better

[22:45] <lumi_> Limbic_Region: I'm reading about it, trying to find an edge

[22:45] <Limbic_Region> I just downloaded and installed alice

[22:45] <Limbic_Region> my first program is going to be a magic square solver

[22:45] <Limbic_Region> once I figure out how

[22:46] * Limbic_Region never learned ML

[22:46] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I've worked a bit with O'Caml and SML.

[22:46] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I have the Graham Function program in O'Caml too.

[22:46] <Limbic_Region> heh, turns out they have a magic square solver in the samples directory

[22:47] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: heh.

[22:47] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: write a program to calculate the Graham function then.

[22:47] <rindolf> :-)

[22:47] <rindolf> I have it in O'Caml, Perl 5 (on CPAN too), Perl 6, and Common Lisp.

[22:48] <pdcawley> LR: I've been looking at the Oz book.

[22:48] <pdcawley> Looks interesting.

[22:52] <Limbic_Region> pdcawley - alice is just the next generation of Oz

[22:52] <Limbic_Region> and yes, looks interesting

[23:05] <Limbic_Region> in any case, it looks more complicated then copying/pasting my real problem so back burnered until at least 2007-03-19

[23:07] <eric256> has anyone been able to get the AJAX version of the "Run Perl Now" script to work?  it always hangs on me and says it took to long to complete, while the non-ajax version works fine
