[14:32] <xerox> Interesting.

[14:33] <gaal> though IIRC audreyt looked at it and mentioned something about Parsec being coupled with lists pretty tightly

[16:33] *** diotalevi joined
[16:34] <moritz> TimToady: I thought that the verb had to be somewhere near the beginning of the sentence ;-)

[16:34] <moritz> TimToady: but if a native speaker tells me it's fine then I'm glad ;-)

[16:35] <diakopter> moritz: that sentence's verb is near (in fact, at) the beginning of the sentence.

[16:38] <gaal> moritz: afaik, there are no such repos, but you can use a recent snapshot from here: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/dist/

[16:38] <lambdabot> Title: Index of /ghc/dist/current/dist

[16:38] <gaal> untar it, "./configure" and "make in-place"; set your path as it directs you.

[16:38] <geoffb> in-place == replace current install ?

[16:39] <gaal> no, not to be installed in /usr/xxxxx

[18:20] <gaal> build? did you get a source tarball? oh no! :)

[18:20] <gaal> there are generic binary tarballs there.

[18:21] <gaal> fight entropy by using one of those rather than compiling your own ghc

[18:22] <moritz> it's useless to fight entropy, but anyway that sounds like less work ;-)

[18:23] <gaal> why is it useless to fight entropy?

[18:23] <wolverian> fighting entropy is easy if you have a source of antientropy handy. like, say, sun. 

[18:23] <moritz> gaal: because you'll loose ;-)

[18:23] <ajs> and today's leading question is....

[18:23] * [particle] man fights entropy man -- entropy wins.

[18:24] *** drupek12178 joined
[18:25] <gaal> I don't think the second law of thermodynamics says anything about how much fun we're allowed to have before entropy wins.

[18:25] *** perlmonkey2 joined
[18:25] <moritz> finitely probably ;-)

[18:26] <gaal> no doubt, but that doesn't mean one shouldn't or couldn't strive to increase one's happiness.

[18:26] <moritz> finite can still be very much ;-)

[18:27] <gaal> A(A(9,9),(A(9,9))

[18:27] <[particle]> pugs -Ofun -Oentropy # "pugs error: options 'fun' and 'entropy' cannot be combined."

[19:48] <dduncan> I have questions or feedback about the Str type, specifically the methods that say how long one is using different measures, like .graphs ...

[19:50] <dduncan> assuming that .graphs and .codes etc reflect the Str as it is now behind the scenes, is it possible to explicitly ask for what the .graphs and .codes etc would be when using particular Unicode normalization forms?

[19:51] <dduncan> Eg, what if I wanted to ask ".graphs when in NFD" or ".graphs when in NFC", without caring what the current form is, which could be either, or none, or several if it isn't normalized?

[19:51] <dduncan> can that be done?
