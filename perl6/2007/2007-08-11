[01:01] <DarkWolf84> can really pugscc make executables

[01:02] <TimToady> I doubt anyone's tried it in the last N months

[01:02] <TimToady> so I'd be surprised if it worked

[08:37] <pmurias> moritz_: sort of mini perl on parrot

[08:38] <pmurias> for making tree transforms

[08:38] <moritz_> pmurias: for integration into PGE/TGE?

[08:38] <moritz_> pmurias: where can I read more?

[08:39] <diakopter> moritz_: it generates pir

[08:39] <pmurias> languages/nqp in the parrot repo ;)

[08:40] <diakopter> http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/nqp/README

[08:41] <moritz_> when PGE executes closures, what interpreter/compiler is used for that?

[08:42] <moritz_> btw the markup in the README is a bit broken.. the list is shown as floating text if viewed with perldoc

[08:52] <moritz_> @tell feb btw my irc logs now support search for multibyte characters (like chinese) as well ;-)
