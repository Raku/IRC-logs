[14:28] <wolverian> :(

[14:40] <pmurias> Aankhen``: slurpy_positional field in Sig maybe

[14:40] <Aankhen``> Okey.

[14:41] * fglock now trying out Erlang as a P6 backend

[14:43] <fglock> I met Pedro Melo at Lisbon.pm meeting, we talked a bit about P6 concurrency

[14:43] <fglock> he's been using Erlang successfully

[14:44] <fglock> we had an idea of possibly mapping each P6 object to an erlang process

[14:45] <Aankhen``> Actor model?

[14:46] <fglock> Aankhen``: have you used erlang?

[14:47] <Aankhen``> Not really.

[14:53] <Aankhen``> I make a distinction between "read a lot about" (i.e. I'm interested in the language) and "read about", though. :-P
