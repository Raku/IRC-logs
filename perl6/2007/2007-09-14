[06:10] <ahmadz> how r u moritz?

[06:21] <moritz_> I'm fine ;-)

[06:21] <ahmadz> cool

[06:21] <moritz_> no work until october 15th ;)

[06:21] <moritz_> happy hacking ;)

[06:21] <moritz_> what about you?

[06:21] <ahmadz> have lots of free time this month ;-)

[06:22] <moritz_> where are you?

[06:22] <ahmadz> jordan/middle east

[06:24] <moritz_> right

[06:25] <moritz_> no, bavaria ;)

[06:25] <ahmadz> ;-)

[06:25] <moritz_> (bavaria is in germany, but most bavarians feel that it shouldn't)

[06:25] <ahmadz> i know

[06:26] <moritz_> but thankfully nobody's gonna change it ;)

[06:26] <ahmadz> i watched a doc special about it in DW-TV...

[06:28] * moritz_ currently reads the recent diffs on p6l

[06:29] <ahmadz> i was wondering if runpugs could do kp6, but dont know if safe mode is there or not...

[06:29] <moritz_> it is ;)

[06:30] <moritz_> I requested it for exp_evalbot and renormalist++ implemented it at the YAPC::EU hackathon

[16:16] <integral> right, but it doens't go through the rate limiting stuff.

[16:16] <Juerd> As I understand it, there is no rate limiting now, but a threat.

[16:17] <[particle]> i don't know what those folks have set up for anti-spam

[16:17] <Juerd> I interpret "threat" as: it's apparently not enough to trigger automatic mechanisms, but we're willing to waste tuits for it.

[16:17] <Juerd> afk

[16:18] <[particle]> i think svnbot may be kicked occasionally now at present, and somebody has to manually fix it

[16:18] <[particle]> i really don't know the details, though

[16:18] <[particle]> just got a visit from an ircop

[19:20] <ferreira> I sent a proposal to obra about a perl6 microgrant. It is about writing light articles about Perl 6 operators to a general IT audience. The proposal is here: http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/proposal.txt

[19:20] <lambdabot> ferreira: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[19:20] <ferreira> @messages

[19:20] <lambdabot> TimToady said 3d 21h 29m 20s ago: pugs does not yet implement Range objects, nor does it really treat * as anything other than Inf, so 0..* is pretty much doomed at the moment

[19:21] <ferreira> I think I logged before but lambdabot did not tell me about this message. Is it possible?

[19:22] *** ahmadz left
[19:22] <TimToady> you have to say something or lambdabot doesn't notice you

[19:22] <ferreira> oh, that was it.

[19:23] <TimToady> rejoining could just be a flapping connection or a netsplit

[19:23] <allbery_b> I suspect handling that is just a side effect

[19:23] <allbery_b> contextual plugins don't hand;e anything other than straight talking

[19:23] <allbery_b> no login/out/join/part, no /action, etc.

[19:25] <ferreira> TimToday: I see. I have seen your elaboration on ++ for strings. I am trying to write a prototype. So the former thing of trying to understand the string as a number is out? For example incrementing '0xFFFF' will result in '0xFFFG', right?

[19:25] <TimToady> correct, convert it yourself first if you care

[19:25] <TimToady> it was pointed out to me that 0a0 eventually gets to 0b0, and then we have trouble

[19:26] <TimToady> and the new <!after '.'> constraint at least solves the 123.456 problem

[19:26] <TimToady> as well as the extension problem

[19:27] <TimToady> and the previous algorithm implied two scans of the string

[19:28] <TimToady> (well, the final scan can be from the end of the string, really)

[19:29] <ferreira> That means incrementing 'a.000.txt.gz' becomes 'b.000.txt.gz' because 'a' would be the incremented sequence. If someone wanted 'a.001.txt.gz', he must increment 'a.000' and append '.txt.gz'

[19:29] *** pelagic joined
[19:29] <TimToady> that won't work either

[19:29] <TimToady> a.000 => b.000

[19:30] <ferreira> No, it's wrong. One must increment '000' and prepend 'a.' and append '.txt.gz'

[19:30] <ferreira> Sorry, I said I said it wrong.

[19:30] <TimToady> maybe we need a language that does interpolation.  :)

[19:31] <dakkar> the only times I've used the magic-inc in Perl 5 were to generate file names inside an array scan

[19:31] <dakkar> I seem to recall that Perl 6 should have some kind of "iteration counter" somewhere. Do I recall worng?

[19:31] <ferreira> By now, I wrote two weak articles, one about zip and other about ~. There are issues with boths. These issues are mainly unimplemented things in all current implementations.

[19:32] <ferreira> For example, 1..* or (@a, *) which could be used in zip operations with infinite lists.

[19:33] <ferreira> and the string increment as well. Should I include these even if people can't try code with these just now?

[19:33] <TimToady> dakkar: you just say "for @list Z 0..* -> $value, $i {...}" to get an iteration counter

[19:33] <ferreira> The articles are at http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/zip.html and http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/stitching.html

[19:33] <lambdabot> Title: Yet Another Perl 6 Operator: Zip

[19:34] <dakkar> TimToady: yes, much better than implicit counters

[19:34] * dakkar has been working too much with TT2 lately

[19:34] <TimToady> (assuming Z is implemented correctly, which it's not yet)

[19:34] <TimToady> there's another TimToady?  8-)

[19:35] <dakkar> Template Toolkit ;) which has a handy 'loop' implicit variable. "handy" unless I'm running 5 nested loops...

[19:35] <wolverian> dakkar, like $_? :) 

[19:35] <dakkar> wolverian: same exact problems, yes

[19:38] <ferreira> pugs: for (1,2) Z <a,b> -> @pair { say "@pair" }

[19:38] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[@pair␤]

[19:39] <ferreira> pugs: for (1,2) Z <a,b> -> @pair { say "{@pair}" }

[19:39] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[1 a,b␤]

[19:39] <ferreira> pugs: for (1,2) Z <a,b> -> $pair { say "{pair}" }

[19:39] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[␤]

[19:39] <ferreira> pugs: for (1,2) Z <a,b> -> $pair { say "{$pair}" }

[19:39] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[1 a,b␤]

[19:41] <TimToady> pugs: for (1,2) Z <a b> -> $pair { say "{$pair}" }

[19:41] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[1 a␤2 b␤]

[19:41] <TimToady> but that's still incorrect by current spec

[19:42] <TimToady> should flatten except in @@ context

[19:43] <TimToady> and the parens should not be necessary by the current precedence tables

[19:43] <wolverian> heh, I was thinking that was a tuple

[19:43] <wolverian> damn you, haskell

[19:44] *** ofer joined
[19:44] <TimToady> it's supposed to be a Capture, which is flattened or not according to context

[19:45] <ferreira> So, it should be (according to S02):    for 1,2 | <a,b> -> $n, $x { say "$n - $x" }

[19:45] <wolverian> oh, even without ;?

[19:45] <wolverian> so parens are more than just precedence?

[19:46] <TimToady> where did that | come from?

[19:47] <TimToady> not to mention the , inside <>

[19:47] <ferreira> It should have been Z 

[19:47] <ferreira> oops

[19:47] <TimToady> wolverian: what ;?

[19:48] <TimToady> you need ; inside zip(1,2; <a b>), but that's because it would otherwise not be able to distinguish the parts

[19:49] <TimToady> a list infix operator like Z is of looser precedence than ,

[19:49] <TimToady> (see table in S03)

[19:49] <TimToady> likewise the X operator, and all its variants

[19:49] <wolverian> ah. thanks :)

[19:50] <ferreira> But give me a clue. Should I mention the specified behavior in the articles even though there is no current compliant implementation?

[19:50] *** ruoso left
[19:51] <TimToady> why would I have a clue about that?

[19:52] <ferreira> Because your arguments rock ;-)

[19:52] *** Blwood left
[19:53] <TimToady> well, it really depends on the purpose of your article.  in any case I'd put a disclaimer on behavior that is already destined to disappear

[19:53] <wolverian> "without you, I'm like a function without arguments" 

[19:54] <TimToady> I should just name all my arguments, and then I wouldn't have to keep positioning them...

[19:55] <ferreira> The purpose of the article would be to tell the world about Perl 6 through mentioning the shiny new operators and also not quite so new, but reformed.

[19:55] <TimToady> then you probably want to document it as it will be, not as it is

[19:55] <TimToady> in that case the disclaimer goes the other direction

[19:55] <ferreira> To tell the truth, it is the purpose of a series of micro-articles to be published in the ONLamp site blog.

[19:55] <ferreira> Ok. I will remember the disclaimer.

[19:56] <TimToady> or just fix pugs  :)

[19:56] <ferreira> Well, I think I am gonna try. But it will take longer than the articles to write.

[19:58] <ferreira> Also (@x, *) is a special construction not implemented yet. It should be especially built as a list that watches its tail and reproduces the end element forever. Isn't it?

[20:00] <TimToady> pugs: 1,2,3 Z 4,5,6

[20:00] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))␤]

[20:00] <TimToady> actually, looks like the precedence was already fixed

[20:00] <TimToady> just needs to flatten by default

[20:00] <TimToady> yes, ",*" isn't implemented

[20:02] <ferreira> for 1,2 Z <a b> -> $a { say "$a" }

[20:02] <TimToady> however, you can do $value xx * if you happen to know the final value

[20:02] <ferreira> pugs: for 1,2 Z <a b> -> $a { say "$a" }

[20:02] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[1 a␤2 b␤]

[20:03] <ferreira> it flattens. What it does not is get the captures.

[20:03] <TimToady> that should have newlines where it has spaces

[20:03] <TimToady> it's shoving 1,'a' into $a together

[20:03] <TimToady> if it were flattened, $a would get and then 'a'

[20:03] <TimToady> s/get/get 1/

[20:04] <TimToady> Z was implemented before we generalized slice context

[20:04] <ferreira> pugs: for 1,2 Z <a b> -> $a, $b { say "a: '$a', b: '$b'" }

[20:04] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[a: '1 a', b: '2 b'␤]

[20:04] <ferreira> nothing gest into $b

[20:04] <ferreira> s/gest/gets/

[20:05] <TimToady> untrue, 2,b gets into $b

[20:05] <TimToady> as your output shows

[20:05] <ferreira> ok

[20:06] <TimToady> it's not flattening like it should

[20:06] * amnesiac flattens TimToady 

[20:06] <ferreira> pugs: for 1,2 Z <a b> -> [$a, $b] { say "a: '$a', b: '$b'" }

[20:06] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** ␤    Unexpected "[$"␤    expecting subroutine parameters, trait or block␤    at /tmp/E1zeYyLYZk line 1, column 20␤]

[20:06] <TimToady> flatteny will get you nowhere

[20:07] <moritz_> amnesiac: don't do that, we need TimToady in all three dimensions ;)

[20:07] *** snearch joined
[20:07] <TimToady> pugs doesn't implement [] sigs yet either

[20:07] <ferreira> This syntax -> [$a, $b] is not ready yet also.

[20:07] <amnesiac> moritz_, true..

[20:07] * amnesiac unflattens TimToady and puts him on his previous state

[20:07] <TimToady> best short term fix would be to make everything flatten, and we can add slice context in later

[20:08] <TimToady> yow, my previous state was Georgia!

[20:09] <amnesiac> are you from Gatech?

[20:09] <TimToady> no, that's just where my plane landed on my way back from YAPC::EU

[20:09] <amnesiac> oh

[20:09] <amnesiac> hah

[20:11] *** rindolf left
[20:11] <TimToady> my current state is California.  it'd be a lot easier to put me on California because it's bigger.

[20:12] <TimToady> not to mention closre

[20:12] <amnesiac> haven't seend audrey in action lately...

[20:12] <amnesiac> what's she doin' now?

[20:12] <TimToady> achieving a sustainable lifestyle

[20:13] <ferreira> hey, but going from "Perl 6" to "Perl6" in docs is the opposite of a patch of chromatic. He bitched about that a lot.

[20:13] <ferreira> Should not POD have a non-breakable space? Like TeX with 'Perl~6' or something?

[20:13] <amnesiac> TimToady, good then

[20:13] <TimToady> it has non-breakable space there

[20:14] <TimToady> your display must not be displaying it correctly

[20:14] <ferreira> Good old Gmail and Firefox

[20:14] <ferreira> It is a Unicode character you introduced in between the words?

[20:15] <TimToady> well, it's just the nobreak space in the Latin-1 range
