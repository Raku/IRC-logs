[00:42] <Limbic_Region> :-(

[00:42] <Limbic_Region> oh wait, it appears all that is needed is a realclean

[00:43] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - you around

[00:44] <Limbic_Region> I am going to email maxcdo

[00:47] *** Schwern joined
[00:47] <diakopter> I'm around

[00:47] <Limbic_Region> salutations Schwern

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> diakopter - what were you going to ask maxcdo?

[00:48] <diakopter> nothing worth anything

[00:48] <diakopter> you figured it out I see

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> oh, was wondering if you had some advice

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> well, it hasn't finished building yet

[00:48] <Limbic_Region> but it didn't bomb out with unsatisfied dependency this time

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> so where did the 6.6.1 dependency come from?  Was there a major checkin or something?

[00:51] <diakopter> audreyt bumped it

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> I ask because I worked 53 hours this week even though I took a day off

[00:51] * Limbic_Region was a bit busy

[00:51] <diakopter> I don't recall the exact reason

[00:51] <diakopter> it's in the logs

[00:51] <Limbic_Region> oh, wonder if the pad refactor went back in

[00:52] <diakopter> I don't think so

[00:53] <Limbic_Region> hrm

[00:53] <Limbic_Region> The recent commits link of pugscode.org and the RSS are both not working

[00:53] <diakopter> urgh

[00:54] <Limbic_Region> is there a way to get just the commit message for like the last 20 checkins from svn?

[00:54] <Limbic_Region> my svn fu is weak

[00:55] <Limbic_Region> oh, pugs did build after the realclean

[00:55] <diakopter> http://dev.pugscode.org/timeline

[00:56] <Limbic_Region> that's not loading here

[00:56] <diakopter> it is here...

[00:56] <diakopter> dns problem?

[00:56] <Limbic_Region> no, it just took like 20 seconds

[00:56] <diakopter> 8.61s here :)

[00:57] <Limbic_Region> thanks btw

[00:57] <diakopter> if you haven't sent that email to that person, tell him/her to join us here! :)

[00:58] <diakopter> er, ask, not tell.

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> oh, already sent

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> but yeah

[00:59] <Limbic_Region> I got the email from the ticket

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> oh, the 6.6.1 dependency was for date/time package apparently

[01:01] <Limbic_Region> but lots of other code cleanup as the result of a utility

[07:56] <protoscript> Hey guys

[07:56] <jrockway> hi protoscript

[07:56] *** elmex joined
[07:56] <protoscript> I was wondering, why did perl6 decide to make operators special things instead of just methods... that prevents using the hyperoperators syntax as a map 

[07:58] <jrockway> what do you mean?

[07:59] <jrockway> (maybe nopaste what you'd like to write)

[08:00] <dduncan> perl operators are just a special syntax for methods, for the most part

[08:00] <protoscript>  ok

[08:00] <protoscript> it's just one line

[08:00] <protoscript> @bad_employees >>fire<<

[08:00] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[08:01] <protoscript> it complains that fire should be an operator

[08:01] <dduncan> try spelling it .fire

[08:01] <protoscript> ah ok

[08:01] <dduncan> ?eval @bad_employees >>.fire<<

[08:01] <evalbot_r17041> Error: ␤Unexpected ">>."␤expecting operator

[08:01] <dduncan> may need work

[08:01] <protoscript> < 1 2 3 > >>.say<<

[08:02] <protoscript> doesn't work either

[08:02] <dduncan> at least you can use the dot form in other places that take operators

[08:02] <protoscript> I was really curious regarding the philosophy behind the decision

[08:02] <dduncan> eg, $foo .bar $baz;

[08:02] <dduncan> er

[08:02] <protoscript> since I thought one of the greatest achievements of ruby, (smalltalk too?) was to make "operators" just funny named methods

[08:03] <protoscript> well that is cool too

[08:03] <dduncan> I was trying for the analogy for $foo += $bar, but replacing + with .meth

[08:03] <dduncan> $foo .meth= $bar 

[08:03] <dduncan> maybe?

[08:03] <protoscript> I could never stomach perl < 6 but perl6 seems really great

[08:03] <dduncan> perhaps reduction syntax works .... $foo = [.meth] @bar

[08:03] <audreyt> ?eval [1, 2, 3]>>.sqrt

[08:03] <evalbot_r17041> (1.0, 1.4142135623730951, 1.7320508075688772)

[08:04] *** rho joined
[08:04] <audreyt> you only need one side of >>

[08:04] <audreyt> because .method is not binary op

[08:04] <protoscript> I'm silly regarding aesthetics and -> syntax and the oo stuff in perl5 just grated on my nerves

[08:04] *** pro21ms4 left
[08:04] <dduncan> audreyt, since you're here, I'll say that everything ran to completion for me yesterday ... build and smoke completed with success ... perhaps a bit faster than my last try also

[08:04] <audreyt> ?eval <1 2 3>>.sqrt

[08:04] <protoscript> ?eval [1,2,3] >>.say

[08:04] <evalbot_r17041> Bool::True

[08:04] <evalbot_r17041> Error: ␤Unexpected ">>."␤expecting operator

[08:04] <audreyt> ?eval <1 2 3>>>.sqrt

[08:04] <evalbot_r17041> (1.0, 1.4142135623730951, 1.7320508075688772)

[08:04] <audreyt> ?eval <1 2 3>>>.say

[08:05] <evalbot_r17041> OUTPUT[2␤3␤1␤] (Bool::True, Bool::True, Bool::True)

[08:05] <audreyt> dduncan: cool!

[08:05] <audreyt> protoscript: note that it says "2\n3\n1\n"

[08:05] <audreyt> because hyperops runs, conceptually, in parallel

[08:05] <dduncan> audreyt, what do you see as the main preconditions now for a 6.28.0 release?

[08:05] <audreyt> so the order of side effects, such as input/output, is not guaranteed

[08:05] <audreyt> dduncan: why, mergeback of my pugs-mo local branch

[08:05] <protoscript> yeah !

[08:05] <dduncan> so that isn't what you did yesterday

[08:06] <dduncan> any eta for that?

[08:06] <protoscript> very interesting audreyt

[08:06] <audreyt> no it isn't. yesterday was just excising dead code

[08:06] <audreyt> playing with HPC, etc

[08:06] <audreyt> I think my condition is improving quite a bit this week

[08:06] <audreyt> so maybe I'll try hacking for real next week... but no promises

[08:06] <protoscript> where is the best place online to get docs rearding pugs perl6?

[08:06] <audreyt> mostly it's incessant sleep

[08:06] <dduncan> try pugscode.org

[08:07] <protoscript> hope you feel better audreyt :-)

[08:07] <dduncan> yes, be well

[08:07] <audreyt> protoscript: dev.pugscode.org perhaps?

[08:07] <audreyt> www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/ too

[08:07] <protoscript> thank you

[08:08] <audreyt> np :)

[08:08] * audreyt fades, unsurprisingly, back into sleep &

[08:08] <dduncan> and I"m about to enter sleep myself

[08:08] <protoscript> are there any cute web frameworks written in perl6?

[08:10] <jrockway> i'm sure there is some jifty6 floating around somewhere (at least on slides)

[08:10] <jrockway> audreyt would be the person to ask though

[08:10] * jrockway likes his perl5 web framework ;)

[08:10] *** ruz left
[08:10] <protoscript> ok thanks jrockway

[08:10] <protoscript> what framework is that?

[08:10] <jrockway> Catalyst

[08:11] <protoscript> Do you think the codebase could be improved porting it to 6?

[08:11] <jrockway> definitely

[08:11] <jrockway> if perl6 didn't exist, we could get by with perl5

[08:11] <protoscript> (I mean theoretically, since its probably a giant undertaking)

[08:11] <jrockway> but there are some perl5-isms that hurt us

[08:11] <jrockway> like slow method calls

[08:12] <protoscript> I've heard from the experts at canonical that catalyst is the only dynamic lang web framework period that gets orm rights

[08:12] <jrockway> we are going to port it to Moose soon, which should at least make the code look nicer

[08:12] <protoscript> -s

[08:12] * protoscript googles moose

[08:12] <jrockway> Catalyst doesn't force any ORM on you, but a lot of people use DBIx::Class

[08:12] <jrockway> and I agree that it gets ORM-ing done right

[08:13] <protoscript> I do python dev for money

[08:13] <jrockway> the nice feature is that you can say my $something = $rs->search({ some conditions }); ...; $something->search( { more conditions } )

[08:13] <jrockway> everything is pretty lazy, so you'll get an efficent query that way (and readable code of course)

[08:15] <jrockway> protoscript: moose is at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/lib/Moose.pm

[08:15] <lambdabot> Title: Moose - A complete modern object system for Perl 5 - search.cpan.org

[08:15] *** protoskript joined
[08:15] <protoskript> grumblez

[08:17] <jrockway> i have a few catalyst talks at www.jrock.us if you're interested

[08:17] <jrockway> (the YAPC::NA::2007 ones are better than the YAPC::Asia::2007 ones IMHO)

[08:17] <protoskript> absolutely thanks

[08:18] <jrockway> jifty is another perl5 framework that is more integrated and magical

[08:18] <jrockway> it's pretty cool if you're into that kind of thing ;)

[08:19] <protoskript> yeah it looked super-cute

[08:19] <protoskript> just have so much trouble with perl5 oo and some of the syntax

[08:19] * protoskript is a shameful languae snob

[08:19] <jrockway> fair enough

[08:20] <jrockway> the object system kind of takes a while to grasp

[08:20] <jrockway> once you are familiar with the conventions (and Class::C3), it's quite usable

[08:20] <protoskript> do u program in perl professionally?

[08:20] <jrockway> but if you come from a (say) java background where everything is ultra-specific ("private int foo") it might not be your cup of tea

[08:20] <jrockway> protoscript: yeah

[08:21] <protoskript> My background is javascript

[08:22] <protoskript> Which made me the subject of much derision in 1999 when I tried to explain that I could write great server-side apps in javascript

[08:22] <protoskript> "Why not just use vbscript?" o_O

[08:23] <jrockway> javascript is a fine programming language

[08:23] <jrockway> the "rhino on rails" might give it some additonal credibility

[08:23] <protoskript> Agreed. No one really understood that back in the 90s

[08:23] <protoskript> But AJAX has given it much more cred

[08:23] <jrockway> exactly

[08:24] <jrockway> what's funny is that AJAX was technically possible long before it became popular

[08:24] <protoskript> for career reasons i had to move to C#, then ruby then python which I use today

[08:24] <protoskript> I know I used to do ajax-ish stuff in 2000 

[08:24] <protoskript> I had a chat room that integrated with a dialer system for a call center

[08:25] <protoskript> just took google to have everyone say ':ok i guess it is reasonable"

[08:25] <jrockway> yeah

[08:25] <jrockway> same for python too :)

[08:26] <protoskript> indeed. ever see prothon back in the day?

[08:26] <protoskript> that was an incredibly awesome language

[08:26] <protoskript> so sad that it was ditched and now i cant even find material on it

[08:29] <jrockway> no, didn't see it

[08:29] <protoskript> It was a prototype-based python that fixed some of the goofy python decisions

[08:30] <protoskript> aaaanyways sorrt for the languages tangent

[17:21] <rhr> so I'm trying to build a new ghc according to the directions moritz++ gave and have run into a problem...

[17:22] <rhr> ghc 6.6.1 built and installed, but it looks like I have to rebiuld libghc6-filepath-dev and friends.  when I go to install the build-deps for libghc6-filepath-dev it wants to remove the old version but fails:

[17:22] <rhr> ghc-pkg: cannot find package FilePath-0.11

[17:23] <rhr> and apt is now stuck not able to do anything because of this

[17:26] <diakopter> rhr: you're on etch?

[17:26] <rhr> yup

[17:28] <diakopter> rhr: if I understand it correctly, I think you should remove libghc6-filepath-dev

[17:28] <rhr> the above error is what I get with the old ghc6 installed.  with the new one I get: /var/lib/dpkg/info/libghc6-filepath-dev.prerm: line 13: /usr/lib/ghc-6.6/bin/ghc-pkg: No such file or directory

[17:28] <diakopter> then reinstall the .deb you built

[17:28] <rhr> diakopter: I can't

[17:28] <rhr> the error prevents it from being removed

[17:28] <diakopter> hrm

[17:29] <diakopter> I guess you'll have to force or manually remove it

[17:29] <rhr> how does one do that?

[17:30] * diakopter gappy index.  consults master index.

[17:31] <diakopter> (my build keeps failing b/c that machine is running out of ram continually...

[17:31] <rhr> I've never encountered the situation where dpkg --purge doesn't work

[17:32] <diakopter> hrm; I didn't even have libghc6-filepath-dev installed.

[17:36] <rhr> even dpkg dpkg --purge --force all doesn't work

[17:37] <diakopter> same error message?

[17:37] <rhr> yup

[18:21] <moritz> any ideas concerning regarding my paste?

[18:21] <rhr> a backport would be very cool.  I can put debs for other archs up if someone supplies them.

[18:22] <rhr> moritz: that looks very similar to what happened to me

[18:22] <moritz> rhr: so how did you fix it?

[18:23] <rhr> if apt and dpkg won't remove the old version, you have to edit /var/lib/dpkg/status manually as diakopter++ describes above

[18:24] <rhr> change the status line for the package to Status: purge ok not-installed

[18:25] <rhr> worked for me anyway...

[18:27] <diakopter> rhr: although... now that I think about it... since that package is provided by the ghc6... that might confuse things

[18:27] <rhr> which package?

[18:27] <diakopter> so maybe that section should be removed entirely.  where's #debian when you need it?

[18:28] <moritz> /var/lib/dpkg/status doesn't list libgh6-filepath-dev

[18:28] <moritz> and ghc6 provides it

[18:28] <rhr> in my case it was the filepath package that was the trouble, and it turns out not to be necessary...

[18:29] *** cmarcelo left
[18:30] <rhr> moritz: you might try re-installing all of the old ghc stuff and then removing all of it before installing the new debs

[18:30] * diakopter seconds that suggestion; over and out

[18:31] <rhr> I don't really understand the underlying problem though, so listen to me at your peril :)

[19:46] <rhr> moritz: what was the missing build-dep? I had to build haddock and haskell-utils in addition to the ghc stuff, but that satisfied everything for me

[19:46] <moritz> @tell audreyt pugs build requires time-any, but Makefile.PL doesn't check for it

[19:46] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[19:47] <moritz> rhr: dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: ghc6-doc libghc6-base-doc libghc6-parsec-doc

[19:49] <moritz> rhr: aye, but ghc6-doc doesn't install for me (dies with a haddoc error)

[23:16] <Aankhen``> (I'm guessing the dependencies thing is okay since the next step is to install them, but I'm worried about not being able to delete the old directory.)

[23:17] <rhr> Aankhen``: I got the warning about the directory also

[23:18] <rhr> what is the dependancy problem?

[23:18] <Aankhen``> One sec, I'll put it on pastebin.

[23:18] <rhr> I'm not sure what the deal is with the directory, but its not being deleted didn't seem to harm anything

[23:20] <rhr> hmm, I guess you should reinstall haskell-utils and then install the new ghc again

[23:20] <Aankhen``> apt-get install haskell-utils?

[23:20] <rhr> the etch haskell-utils

[23:20] <rhr> yes

[23:20] <Aankhen``> OK.

[23:35] <pasteling> "Aankhen" at 24.80.73.85 pasted "Haddock error" (27 lines, 1.5K) at http://sial.org/pbot/26324

[23:35] <Aankhen``> rhr: Error with the doc package now.

[23:36] <rhr> fascinating...

[23:37] <Aankhen``> Um, yeah, totally.

[23:37] <rhr> you've installed the new haddock already?

[23:37] <Aankhen``> AFAIK, yes.

[23:38] <rhr> then maybe try installing the old haddock, installing ghc-doc again, and then installing the new haddock

[23:39] <Aankhen``> OK.

[23:39] <Aankhen``> Er, how

[23:39] <Aankhen``> ?

[23:39] *** justatheory joined
[23:40] <rhr> apt-get install haddock; dpkg -i ghc6-doc_6.6.1-*.deb; dpkg -i haddock*.deb

[23:40] <Aankhen``> `apt-get install haddock` seems to try to install ghc6-doc and fails with the same error as I pasted.

[23:40] <Aankhen``> Same errors, rather.

[23:41] <rhr> ok, can you apt-get remove ghc6-doc?

[23:41] <Aankhen``> Done.

[23:41] <rhr> then retry those 3 commands

[23:41] <Aankhen``> OK.

[23:41] <Aankhen``> haddock is already at the newest version, apparently.

[23:42] *** mako132_ joined
[23:42] <rhr> oh, are you looking at the latest rev of INSTALL?  I changed the order of the ghc6-doc installation

[23:42] <Aankhen``> Nope, no good.  apt-get install haddock insists that it's at the newest version already.

[23:42] <Aankhen``> I believe so.  One sec.

[23:43] <Aankhen``> Yes, I am.

[23:43] <rhr> in that case you should compile and install the new haddock before installing ghc6-doc, I think

[23:43] <Aankhen``> I followed all the instructions. :-S

[23:43] <rhr> can you verify which version of haddock is installed?

[23:44] <rhr> maybe you need to apt-get remove haddock and then apt-get install haddock to get the old version

[23:45] <rhr> if it's the new version that's causing the problem

[23:45] <Aankhen``> Okay, did that.

[23:46] <rhr> ok, now can you dpkg -i ghc6-doc_6.6.1-*.deb ?

[23:46] <Aankhen``> Same error. -_-

[23:47] <rhr> hmm, apt-get remove haddock; dpkg -i ghc6-doc_6.6.1-*.deb ?

[23:47] <Aankhen``> Now it says haddock is not installed.

[23:47] <Aankhen``> (When it reaches ghc6-doc.)

[23:48] <Aankhen``> Wait, one sec.  Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

[23:48] <Aankhen``> I'll pastebin it.

[23:48] <pasteling> Someone at 24.80.73.85 pasted "# apt-get remove haddock; dpkg" (23 lines, 978B) at http://sial.org/pbot/26325

[23:48] <Aankhen``> rhr: There you go.

[23:48] <rhr> I wish I knew what those error messages actually meant...

[23:49] <Aankhen``> Maybe it's trying to read new haddock docs with the old haddock?

[23:49] <rhr> but it didn't work with the new haddock, right?

[23:49] <Aankhen``> I think the new haddock just didn't install at all.

[23:49] <rhr> oh, what was the problem there?

[23:49] <Aankhen``> It went through the motions but doesn't seem to have had any effect.

[23:50] <Aankhen``> I'll try going through the steps for haddock again.

[23:51] <rhr> huh, ok

[23:55] <Aankhen``> Nah, no luck.

[23:56] <Aankhen``> BTW, I'm not sure if this is all I'm supposed to get...

[23:56] <pasteling> Someone at 24.80.73.85 pasted "# dpkg -i haddock*.deb Selecti" (6 lines, 235B) at http://sial.org/pbot/26326

[23:56] <Aankhen``> It just drops me back at the prompt at that point.

[23:58] <rhr> that looks normal to me

[23:58] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[23:58] <rhr> let me try it...

[23:58] <Aankhen``> Well, whatever it is, ghc6-doc is still not happy.
