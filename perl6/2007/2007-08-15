[18:57] <moritz_> squirrelmail on feather has problems (can't connect to mailserver at localhost)

[18:57] <moritz_> I don't use it so I don't mind, I just wanted to mention it

[18:57] <moritz_> ;)

[19:00] *** fglock_ left
[19:00] <Juerd> Thanks

[19:01] <Juerd> I don't think anybody uses that :)

[19:01] <[particle]> juerd: is perlsix.org a feather thing?

[19:01] <[particle]> http://perlsix.org/svn/parrot/revision/?rev=20628 doesn't work for me

[19:01] <lambdabot> Title: revision: /parrot (Rev: 20628, via SVN::Web)

[19:01] <Juerd> [particle]: perlsix.org points to feather, yes.

[19:02] <Juerd> I've never heard of the domain :)

[19:02] <diakopter> seems to work for feather accessing itself... (I own the domain)

[19:02] <diakopter> er, for lambdabot

[19:02] <Juerd> Isn't that dev.pugscode.org anyway? :)

[19:02] <Juerd> Oh, parrot

[19:02] <Juerd> Hm

[19:02] <diakopter> not that one, no

[19:02] <diakopter> it's SVN::Web (not python/trac)

[19:02] <Juerd> [particle]: Works for me by the way

[19:03] <diakopter> Juerd: TimToady was having routing problems to feather yesterday.  perhaps particle is now having routing problems as well.

[19:04] <Juerd> dovecot + squirrelmail fixed

[19:04] <Juerd> [particle]: Can you ping 193.200.132.135?

[19:04] *** weinig joined
[19:04] <Juerd> Da's niet veel.

[19:06] *** weinig left
[19:06] <[particle]> i was also having thes problems yesterday. pinging now...

[19:06] <Juerd> Any pongs?

[19:06] <[particle]> no response

[19:07] *** weinig joined
[19:07] <Juerd> [particle]: Please paste me the output of a traceroute 

[19:07] <Juerd> See pastebot :)

[19:09] <[particle]> http://nopaste.snit.ch:8001/10895

[19:12] <Juerd> Hm, annoying

[19:13] <Juerd> We have no route to your IP

[19:13] <Juerd> I wonder how that can happen

[19:13] <Juerd> Oh, we do

[19:13] <Juerd> Via abovenet indeed

[19:14] <Juerd> [particle]: I'm delegating this to $cow_orker

[19:14] <Juerd> Sorry I can't help you

[19:14] <[particle]> moo

[19:15] <[particle]> thanks for looking

[19:15] <Juerd> Anyone else who can't reach feather, and can give me a traceroute?

[19:17] <diakopter> Juerd: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/out.pl?channel=perl6;date=2007-08-14#i_82257

[19:17] <lambdabot> Title: IRC log for #perl6, 2007-08-14, http://tinyurl.com/ywg9ry

[19:19] <pasteling> "TimToady" at 71.139.42.162 pasted "my traceroute" (22 lines, 1K) at http://sial.org/pbot/26872

[19:19] <Juerd> diakopter: Can't report the issues at abovenet without a full traceroute. Their routing is complex, and the last hop isn't necessarily the problem.

[19:19] <Juerd> TimToady: Thanks! :)
