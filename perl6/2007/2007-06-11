[14:43] <jdv79> Is there any news of late?  I haven't seen any.

[14:43] * offby1 glances around nervously. 

[14:48] <jdv79> anyone picked up the summaries yet?

[14:48] <kolibrie> not that I know of

[14:48] <thoughtpolice> from my logs it's been slow for the past day or so

[14:49] <thoughtpolice> i count nine lines of actual text since about this time yesterday.

[14:50] <offby1> line number ten!

[14:50] <thoughtpolice> well, nine up to this line: 03:48 < jdv79> Is there any news of late?  I haven't seen any.

[14:51] <thoughtpolice> so you came in at 11. :(

[14:53] <jdv79> is there a root "todo" list anywhere?

[14:55] <moritz> iirc there was one on dev.pugscode.org

[14:55] <moritz> but trac is disabled :(

[14:55] <moritz> "implement perl 6" is our root todo list ;)

[14:57] <jdv79> ...

[15:05] <thoughtpolice> short, sweet, to the point.

[15:05] <thoughtpolice> i love it. :)

[16:00] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of Shlomi Fish (918)

[16:03] <ashleyb> I'm trying to understand the disjunctive and conjunctive types of 'any()' & 'all()', so I'm working through some examples in Perl 5 in http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Quantum-Superpositions-1.03/lib/Quantum/Superpositions.pm -- I'm trying the 'True love' example, but I cannot figure it out, is that a typo in damian's example or should it work.  Here's what I'm playing with: http://sial.org/pbot/25493

[16:03] *** weinigLap joined
[16:04] <ashleyb> no matter what I try to put in the if() statement there to match '$ideal'  it won't match

[16:04] <ashleyb> any suggestions?

[16:05] *** weinigLap joined
[16:05] *** Limbic_Region joined
[16:06] <ashleyb> is there a way to match a superposition of the form   'all(any(@a), any(@b))'

[16:08] <ashleyb> ehh excuse me, I meant 'any(all(@a), all(@b))'

[16:09] *** buetow joined
[16:13] <rindolf> ashleyb: if you have != then yes.

[16:14] <ashleyb> hmm

[16:15] <ashleyb> but from what I can see, they will always be not equal, as in 'any(all(1,2), all(3,4)) != all(@x)' is always true

[16:15] <ashleyb> for all values of @x

[16:15] <ashleyb> and even any values of @x

[16:16] <ashleyb> same goes for: 'any(all(1,2), all(3,4)) != any(@x)'

[16:17] <rindolf> ashleyb: or < or whatever.

[16:17] <rindolf> ashleyb: or myfunc(any(all,all)) == something.

[16:17] <rindolf> Assuming Damian's Q-S module go as far.

[16:18] <ashleyb> yeah, so am I right in thinking damian's example is misleading?

[16:18] *** jerrylee left
[16:19] <ashleyb> basically this is always true:   all(@x) != all(@y)  # even when @x := @y

[16:20] <ashleyb> hmm

[16:20] <ashleyb> maybe that's not true

[16:20] <ashleyb> if @x only has one value

[16:21] <ashleyb> and or if: @x := @y = (any(@set), any(@set));

[16:21] <ashleyb> but assuming the values of @x are not junctive types

[16:22] <ashleyb> and that @x has more than one value, that 'all(@x) != all(@x)'

[16:23] <ashleyb> qed:    I conclude Damian's example is wrong.

[17:14] <gaal> we'd lost about a week's worth of announcements

[17:17] <moritz> just re-enable trac

[17:17] <moritz> then anybody can see them online

[17:26] <[particle]> how about svnweb, does that give a log?

[17:46] <rindolf> a?

[17:47] <rindolf> avar: that's one killer feature of SVN::RaWeb::Light (my own module) that I didn't see implemented anywhere.

[17:51] <avar> I don't remember, but I'm sure it's trivial to add

[22:56] <ron__> anyone see the problem with the Bozzle class line I just posted ?

[22:56] <Tene> You're trying to have a public and private variable with the same name.

[22:58] <ron__> It originally came from redefining a class.  I could understand an error but returning the assignment to the private var seems surprising to me.

[22:58] <[particle]> yes, that seems like it should emit a warning, or throw an exception

[22:59] *** olliej|disguise is now known as weinigLap

[22:59] <[particle]> (probably the latter, although the former is an exception, too)

[23:02] <ron__> I have a few other similar examples.  If there is no objection I will probably post on perl6-compiler.

[23:02] <[particle]> please do. feel free to write failing tests, check them in, and post.
