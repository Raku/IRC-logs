[00:06] <specbot6> r14379 | larry++ | Clarification suggested by TheDamian++

[00:10] <diakopter> I accidentally committed something to my svk local mirror; how do I commit the previous revision of that file so when I push, the file doesn't get committed upstream at all?

[00:15] *** rissy joined
[00:16] <diakopter> downstream, I mean, I guess.

[00:25] <jrockway> diakopter: delete the branch and start over

[00:25] <jrockway> or you can svk cp from an older revision

[00:25] <jrockway> and push with --lump

[00:26] <jrockway> there's no good "forget this commit" comman though

[00:26] <jrockway> both will mess up merge tracking, i think

[00:26] <jrockway> *think*

[00:26] <jrockway> (not 100% sure)

[00:30] <diakopter> jrockway: thanks

[10:14] <dduncan> it would be if the default new() were used

[10:14] <dduncan> of Collar

[10:14] <dduncan> but an explicitly declared new() in Collar could do something else

[10:15] <dduncan> personally, I prefer to stick with the default named args for most constructors

[10:16] <dduncan> that is, I always declare explicit BUILD, which have named args, and the new() implicitly matches them, which I leave

[13:35] *** jerrylee joined
[13:35] <rindolf> pmurias: because he was.

[13:35] <rindolf> pmurias: and he was also known to be very unfriendly.

[13:36] <pmurias> rindolf: what valueble thing did he produce?

[13:36] <rindolf> pmurias: cars.

[13:36] <pmurias> cars--

[13:36] <rindolf> pmurias: and buses and stuff.

[13:36] <nothingmuch> and rubber

[13:36] <rindolf> pmurias: you need to look at inventions at their context.

[13:37] <rindolf> pmurias: some car companies also make buses and trucks.

[13:37] <rindolf> pmurias: I don't have a driver's licence.

[13:37] <rindolf> But I still appreciate Henry Ford.

[13:37] *** [particle] joined
[13:38] <rindolf> pmurias: Henry Ford also pioneered the 40 hours work week.

[13:38] <pmurias> i personaly belive cars are the worst invetion on earh

[13:38] <rindolf> pmurias: no, they're not.

[13:38] <rindolf> pmurias: and let's s/cars/automobiles/

[13:39] <pmurias> they are the only real threat to my life

[13:39] <rindolf> pmurias: we may transcend cars someday.

[13:39] <rindolf> Just like we transcended horses or fax machines.

[13:40] <pmurias> Eistain rindolf: what is a worse invention (not counting weapons)?

[13:40] <pmurias> s/Eintain//

[13:40] <rindolf> Einstein.

[13:41] <rindolf> pmurias: I don't think inventions can be bad.

[13:41] <rindolf> pmurias: if something can be invented then by inventing it (and developing it, etc.) it may prove useful to someone.

[13:41] <rindolf> "A worse invention"?

[13:41] <rindolf> Do you mean "The worst invention"?

[13:42] <pmurias> yes

[13:42] <rindolf> pmurias: OK.

[13:43] <rindolf> pmurias: so I think the worst invention is meaningless.

[13:43] <rindolf> You can talk about the greatest inventions:

[13:43] <rindolf> Writing, the Alphabet, electricity, etc.

[13:43] <rindolf> the Internet, computers.

[13:44] <ayrnieu> I liked Chivalry: you could then build knights.

[13:44] <rindolf> ayrnieu: heh.

[13:44] <rindolf> ayrnieu: Civilisation?

[13:45] <ayrnieu> rindolf - yes.  Sim City also has powerful metaphores.

[13:46] <ayrnieu> rindolf - e.g., did you know that the way to make money is to build public services and then underfund them?

[13:47] <pmurias> can you have negative public service spending?

[13:48] *** jerrylee joined
[13:48] <ayrnieu> no, you have a dial between 0% and 100% of funding for each Police and Fire station.  Every % below 100 goes into your own coffers, which you can use to build more interesting facilities -- air ports!

[13:50] <pmurias> i thought you got many from the taxpayers and they just demand so much stuff that you can't get a substancial income

[13:51] <ayrnieu> Yes, you can beat that by underfunding public services.

[13:51] * ayrnieu &

[13:51] <pmurias> thanks

[13:53] <ayrnieu> well, I'll stay long enough to say: governments -really do- make money this way, by raising taxes 'to fix the roads', pilfering the income from that tax, and then coming back five years later to raise taxes again over how bad the roads are.  Also, governments -really do- use their police as a form of taxation, by e.g. installing red-light cameras, raising red-light fines, and then shortening yellow-light duration.

[17:28] <wolverian> argh! unfortunately.

[17:29] <rindolf> wolverian: OK.

[17:29] <rindolf> BTW, I went to Office Depot the other day and they had a rather poor selection of keyboards.

[17:29] <rindolf> I recall being in a shop with much more.

[17:55] <fglock> how would you call an operation that, given a Regex and a Match, returns a Str?

[17:56] <moritz> fglock: reverse matching?

[17:58] *** ozo_ joined
[18:01] <fglock> moritz: in a single word (subroutine name)

[18:02] <moritz> fglock: so what should it do?

[18:02] <[particle]> my question precisely

[18:02] <[particle]> does it generate strings that match a regex?

[18:04] <[particle]> or, generate the smallest possible string from the passed Match, created from the passed Regex

[18:06] *** laye joined
[18:06] *** Southen joined
[18:06] <fglock> it should generate a string that uses all the data in the Match, and all the Regex (it's a template function)

[18:07] <moritz> "unroll"?

[18:07] <fglock>   template( /nums:\d+/, Match.new( positionals => [1..3] ) )  # nums:123

[18:08] <fglock> oops

[18:08] <fglock>   template( /nums:(\d)+/, Match.new( positionals => [1..3] ) )  # nums:123

[18:08] <rindolf> fglock: isn't it Ruby?

[18:09] <fglock> rindolf: dunno

[18:10] <rindolf> fglock: where do you see this code?

[18:10] <fglock> hmm - in my head?

[18:10] <fglock> just an idea

[18:10] <wolverian> did you search CPAN? :)

[18:11] <fglock> wolverian: it could be a module under Pugs::Compiler::Rule

[18:21] <veritos> hey...i realised that i had a problem with miniperl6-on-python.

[18:21] <veritos> you can't write a function called print.

[18:21] <veritos> def print is a syntax error, since print is a keyword.

[18:21] <veritos> it's apparently just like writing one called def if.

[18:22] <fglock> avar: rw parameters? v6.pm uses Data::Bind

[18:22] <[particle]> veritos: time for name mangling

[18:22] <veritos> [particle]: def perlfn_print(params)?

[18:23] <[particle]> that'll work

[18:23] <fglock> veritos: I've been renaming functions to 'Code_'~$name
