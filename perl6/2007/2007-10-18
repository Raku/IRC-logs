[09:09] <spinclad> @tell fax i'm sure that *all* .emit_lisp's should take '($interpreter, $indent)'  (not that $indent is doing anything useful now; if it is for counting indentation it needs to be bumped up and down at every use / paren passed.)

[09:09] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[09:12] *** IllvilJa joined
[09:13] <Aankhen``> spinclad: Yes, I punted on indentation until &infix:<x> is implemented since I was feeling too lazy to do it any other way.

[09:18] *** jisom left
[09:19] <masak> Aankhen``: is &infix:<x> far from being implemented, then?

[09:19] <Aankhen``> I'm not sure.

[09:20] <Aankhen``> It would need to be implemented in MP6, AIUI.

[09:20] <masak> why?

[09:20] <masak> isn't mp6 more or less stable?

[09:20] <Aankhen``> Because we need it in EmitLisp.pm, which (again, AIUI) is compiled by MP6.
