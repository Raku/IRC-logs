[16:04] <Limbic_Region> unfortunately, being slightly off my rocker means being more than a little unstable which is a non-option for me (have family to think about)

[16:05] <Limbic_Region> the FAQ regarding copyrighted digital media or something else?

[16:05] <moritz> I just tried to use ~~ in bleadperl

[16:06] <moritz> Feature "~~" is not supported by Perl 5.9.5

[16:06] <moritz> it says when I 'use feature qw(~~)'

[16:06] <args> certainly, it's on by default.

[16:06] <args> we judged it wasn't a syntax hazard enough to warrant mandating "use feature"

[16:07] <args> and you can't turn it off actually. (like //)

[16:07] <args> "use feature" is now only required for new keywords. which may clash (and do) with existing function names.

[16:07] <args> also, "use 5.10" will do an implicit "use feature ':5.10'"

[19:50] <tumulus> hello - just want to check some Perl 6 before I commit a test for a bug

[19:50] <tumulus> my $l = 5; say "$l {$l} {my $l=123} $l";

[19:50] <tumulus> outputs "5 5 123 5" as I'd expect

[19:51] <tumulus> is there any reason that

[19:51] <tumulus> my $l = 5; say "$l {$l} {my $l=123} {$l}";

[19:51] <tumulus> shouldn't do exactly the same?

[19:51] <tumulus> (difference is $l vs {$l} at the end)

[19:52] <moritz> I don't know... do multiple {} interpolations compose the same closure?

[19:53] <TimToady> certainly not

[19:53] <rindolf> Hi wolverian, TimToady 

[19:53] <rindolf> We're discussing COBOL on #perlcafe 

[19:53] <amnesiac> isn't pugs backend written in cobol?

[19:53] <tumulus> so the test should expect the same output in both cases?

[19:53] <TimToady> yes

[19:54] <tumulus> super - thanks :-)

[19:54] <moritz> amnesiac: certainly not ;)

[19:54] <amnesiac> ;)

[19:55] <dduncan> TimToady, the last synopsis improvement was big ... I also liked the new names for the roles that the sigils represent ... better than having roles like the type names but not like the types

[19:55] <TimToady> thought about those a long time...

[19:56] <dduncan> not surprised

[19:57] <TimToady> kinda hard to describe Essence of Sigil :)

[20:06] <rhandom> I had often wondered at the usefulness of the % and @ sigils (similar to thoughts in recent threads) - but the new synopsis really helps lay out the beauty of the sigils.

[20:06] <rhandom> It is a sort of nirvana

[20:07] <rhandom> well maybe not nirvana - but I really like the roles.

[20:07] <rhandom> it sort of opens the doors for all sorts of wonderful magic

[20:29] * tumulus discovers that it's his own local build that is broken

[20:33] <moritz> tumulus: I hope that you write the test cases anyway ;)

[20:33] <Aankhen``> Couple of questions.

[20:33] <tumulus> indeed - already committed :-)

[20:33] <Aankhen``> 1. regex foo { { #{{ CLOSURE 1 }} } ... { #{{ CLOSURE 2 }} } } # is there a way to declare a variable within CLOSURE 1 that's scoped to the regex, so that it can be viewed from CLOSURE 2?

[20:34] <TimToady> $<foo>

[20:34] <Aankhen``> 2. Is the spelling of the implicitly parallelized loop `hyperfor` or `hyper for`?  If it's the later, may I ask how it reaches into the innards of the `for`? :-S

[20:34] <TimToady> automatically scoped to the current $/

[20:34] <Aankhen``> But that sticks it onto the result object, which means it's visible beyond the regex, doesn't it?

[20:34] <Aankhen``> Oh.

[20:34] <Aankhen``> Hmm.

[20:34] <Aankhen``> Right.

[20:35] <Aankhen``> Thanks. ^_^

[20:35] <TimToady> it's hyper for

[20:35] <TimToady> yes, you may ask

[20:35] <TimToady> :)

[20:35] <Aankhen``> Consider it asked!

[20:35] <moritz> ;)

[20:36] <TimToady> same way eager vs lazy propagates context inward

[20:36] <Aankhen``> Ahh.

[20:36] <TimToady> hyper is just an eager variant

[20:36] <Aankhen``> Okay.

[20:36] <Aankhen``> I started thinking about that last night before I went to sleep and it was driving me crazy. :-P

[20:40] <moritz> I don't like the "hyper" key word, because it tells the compiler what to do... I'd better like "pure", because it describes your own code

[20:41] <moritz> but they are not always identical, so it wouldn't be a good idea to use that either

[20:42] <TimToady> we could change lazy, eager, and hyper to slow, medium, and fast. :)

[20:43] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[20:43] <TimToady> or maybe lazy, impatient, and hubristic

[20:43] <TimToady> in the sense of "I deserve all these CPUs running at once..."

[20:43] <moritz> lol

[20:43] <Aankhen``> warpspeed for @foo -> $a { say "You only THINK there's just one parameter here." }

[20:43] <wolverian> it's more like "do more work" than "be faster" 

[20:44] <TimToady> actually, one could argue that the faster variants do less work

[20:45] <TimToady> eager doesn't have to keep track of the iterators and continuations

[20:45] <moritz> with multiple CPUs faster != less work

[20:45] <TimToady> and hyper doesn't have to keep the processes in sequence

[20:45] <wolverian> it depends on how much of the result you use

[20:45] <TimToady> eager and hyper both promise that you really want it all, more or less

[20:46] <wolverian> but it's not explicit in the name 

[20:46] <TimToady> eager says "burn memory" and hyper says "burn CPUs"

[20:47] <wolverian> (not saying it should be, just pointing out they're different to lazy in that sense)

[20:47] <moritz> and eval says "burn code" ;)

[20:47] <wolverian> TimToady, I like that definition. .)

[20:47] <wolverian> s/\.)/:)/

[20:47] <TimToady> if we renamed "hyper" we'd also have to rename hyperoperators

[20:48] <moritz> I'm not really suggesting to rename "hyper", I was just pondering idly ;)

[20:50] <TimToady> we could name them neurotypical, autistic, and ADHDish  :)

[20:55] <moritz> or maybe the names of some perl developers

[20:55] <moritz> larry, randal, damian

[20:56] <moritz> perhaps in a different order ;)

[21:01] <rindolf> moritz: I want to be an operator in Perl!

[21:01] <moritz> rindolf: since you can define operators for yourself, that's no problem

[21:02] <moritz> sub prefix:<rindolf> { say "foo" }; my $a = rindolf"42"

[21:02] <moritz> or something ;)

[21:02] <Aankhen``> multi *postfix:<rindolf> (Str $operand) { $operand ~= " rindolf'd"; }

[21:02] <Aankhen``> Well, `Str $operand is rw`.

[21:02] <rindolf> Aankhen``: what does ~= do?

[21:03] <rindolf> Aankhen``: wasn't it supposed to be ~~?

[21:03] <Aankhen``> ~ is the string concatenation operator.

[21:03] <rindolf> Aankhen``: oh, OK.

[21:03] <Aankhen``> So that function appends " rindolf'd" to the string.

[21:03] <rindolf> Aankhen``: OK.

[21:03] <Aankhen``> Hmm.

[21:03] <Aankhen``> multi *postfix:<rindolf> (Str $operand) { "<rindolf>$operand</rindolf>" }

[21:04] <Aankhen``> ?eval multi *postfix:<rindolf> (Str $operand) { "<rindolf>$operand</rindolf>" }; "abcd" rindolf

[21:04] <evalbot_r16510> Error: Odd number of elements found where hash expected: VStr "abcd"

[21:05] <Aankhen``> :-(

[21:06] <moritz> Aankhen``: I think posfix ops can't have a whitespace in front of them

[21:06] <moritz> ?eval multi *postfix:<rindolf> (Str $operand) { "<rindolf>$operand</rindolf>" }; "abcd"rindolf

[21:07] <evalbot_r16510> Error: Odd number of elements found where hash expected: VStr "abcd"

[21:37] <Tene> I don't see any tests in t/ for defining circumfix operators.  Is that accurate, or do I not know what I'm looking for?

[21:39] <moritz> in unspecced/sub_application.t there are a few method postcircumfix:<( )>

[21:39] <Tene> Yes, but that's postcircumfix, not circumfix.

[21:39] <moritz> oh, sorry

[21:40] <moritz> operators/operator_overloading.t: two circumfix macros

[21:41] <moritz> but there's need for more

[21:42] <moritz> should circumfix:<[[ ]]> or some such work?

[21:43] <Tene> That's what I'm seeing in the spec.

[21:56] <meppl> good night

[21:57] <moritz> Tene: are you writing a test?

[21:57] <Tene> moritz: I wanted to check if there was a reason that it wasn't already tested where other operator definitions are tested.

[21:58] * moritz can't think of any

[22:00] <rhandom> i know this isn't on topic - how do you call a builtin from XS

[22:01] <offby1> very carefully

[22:27] <moritz> PerlJam: not yet ;)

[22:27] <rhandom> there are just many bright perl 5 people here to

[22:27] <offby1> presumably, integration with C will be lovely in p6

[22:27] <rhandom> I think NCI will be great

[22:27] <offby1> Lawd knows it's skeery in p5

[22:28] <PerlJam> moritz: not ever!

[22:28] <Aankhen``> NCI?

[22:28] <rhandom> In parrot - not sure how it ties in at Perl 6 yet.  Native Call Interface (i think)

[22:28] <moritz> PerlJam: actually I never used it ;) (happy /me I guess)

[22:28] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[22:29] <PerlJam> rhandom: The plan is for Perl to have some form of NCI-like thingy, but it is yet unspecced.
