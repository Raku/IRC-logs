[15:44] <lichtkind> i love dune

[15:44] <lichtkind> no duncon, british columbia

[15:44] <rgs> apparently there are five duncan in the USA, but none of them are in idaho

[15:45] <lichtkind> i thought that you mean duncan idaho  the figure from the dune novel

[15:46] <rgs> that was a pun, yes

[15:51] <TimToady> no, I wasn't born in any place named Duncan.

[15:51] <TimToady> I was born near LA

[15:51] <TimToady> and I don't mean Louisiana...

[15:52] <geoffb> You're from Southern California?  And you did something good for humanity?  Wow, maybe there's hope for us all ....  ;-)

[15:53] <TimToady> I'm "from" all up and down the west coast, depending on how you care to define "from".

[15:54] <jerrylee> building pugs is really not easy

[15:54] * geoffb resembles that remark ...

[15:54] <TimToady> on Windows?

[15:54] <jerrylee> yes

[15:54] <[particle]> is that why i see all those "larry wall raised here - next exit" signs on the highways?

[15:54] <TimToady> yep

[15:56] <TimToady> you'll notice none of them say "grew up" though.

[15:56] <jerrylee> it took me all night to build it

[15:56] <TimToady> how much memory?

[15:56] <fglock> [particle]: do you know how much of class/namespace is implemented in p6-in-parrot? there are no tests for this

[15:57] <jerrylee> install ghc, activeperl, nmake ...

[15:57] <[particle]> i don't know if it's implemented at all

[15:57] <fglock> k

[15:57] <jerrylee> 512m

[15:57] <[particle]> if i recall, it was waiting the object implementation, which we now have

[15:58] <TimToady> 512 works but tends to thrash ghc a bit.  My compiles got a lot faster after I upped it to 1.5M

[15:59] <TimToady> (though that was with ghc 6.4; don't know if 6.6 is still that hungry)

[15:59] <jerrylee> and it's not easy for newbie to do it :) (though i am not newbie)

[15:59] *** MikeJS left
[16:00] <TimToady> most everyone here is a trooper, or too new to figure out that they're not.  :)

[16:01] <gaal> 6.6 is still hungry, yes, but all other things being equal is much faster.

[16:01] <TimToady> the attitude we have to guard against as we go forward is "It was hard for me, so it has to be hard for everyone else now too"

[16:02] <moritz> jerrylee: I have 512mb RAM too, minus a bit video ram.. it swaps but it compiles (if you are patient ;-)

[16:02] <TimToady> I don't mind some vicarious suffering, as long as it really is alleviating someone else's future pain.  But if not...

[16:02] <gaal> er, certainly not saying that 6.6 being hungry's a good thing. :)

[16:03] <jerrylee> moritz: it's compiling, though used all resources ;)

[16:05] <TimToady> moritz: can you borrow some extra ram and see if your smoke still fails?

[16:06] <TimToady> or maybe add more swap space?

[16:06] <moritz> TimToady: no, I have a ~3 yrs old laptop, and I don't know anybody around with compatible ram

[16:06] <TimToady> running what?

[16:06] <moritz> TimToady: but I do have 1G swap, and that's never full

[16:06] <moritz> debian

[16:07] <TimToady> hmm

[16:07] <TimToady> well, scratch that theory then

[16:07] <PerlJam> moritz: the laptop is 3 years old, but how old is the debian?  ;)

[16:07] <geoffb> moritz: Are you running with X, or sitting at console?

[16:07] <moritz> PerlJam: released on sunday ;-)

[16:07] * [particle] scratches david wheeler

[16:07] <moritz> geoffb: with X + FVWM

[16:08] <PerlJam> moritz: try turning off all that X stuff and compile again.

[16:08] <geoffb> moritz: you might consider going telinit 1 and doing the compile, and see how that goes

[16:08] <TimToady> I was more addressing the smoke failure mentioned on p6c

[16:08] <moritz> PerlJam, geoffb: I'll do that tonight before going to bed

[16:08] <geoffb> or rebooting to 'single'

[16:08] <PerlJam> I know the first time I compiled pugs, I had to do it without X running. (though my situation changed such that it wasn't a problem)

[16:15] <wolverian> Juerd, thanks! you're a very gracious host. Juerd++

[16:16] <Juerd> wolverian: Can I delegate adding all the locales to you?

[16:17] <wolverian> Juerd, sure. I don't think I have sudo right now though

[16:17] <wolverian> Juerd, you want them _all_?

[16:18] <Juerd> Yes, all

[16:18] <wolverian> I can do that.

[16:18] <Juerd> You have sudo access now

[16:18] <wolverian> just manual work, I think. :) 

[16:18] <wolverian> thanks.

[16:19] <Juerd> There's probably a list of all locales, but I cuoldn't find it

[16:19] <Juerd> Thank *you*

[16:19] <moritz> dpkg-reconfigure locales should do

[16:19] <wolverian> yup, doing that now.

[16:19] <moritz> Debian++

[16:19] <wolverian> it's just annoying to click down check click down check down check down check ....

[16:20] <wolverian> oh wait, there's "All locales" :)

[16:20] <wolverian> Juerd, what's the default locale?

[16:20] <moritz> Debian++ # for debconf ;-)

[16:20] <wolverian> Juerd, that is, do you have a preference? :)

[16:20] <moritz> I think "C" should be just fine?

[16:21] <PerlJam> Juerd: Am I just a little off, or are you delegating blame?  "It's wolverian's fault the locales are still broken"  :)

[16:21] <Juerd> wolverian: System locale should be C

[16:22] <wolverian> okay.

[16:22] <wolverian> generating now. should be fixed when it's done.

[16:22] <Juerd> i.e. there shouldn't be any locale by default

[16:22] <Juerd> Great, thanks

[16:22] <Juerd> PerlJam: Yep.

[16:22] <Juerd> :)

[16:22] <wolverian> delegating is fine as long as I have a clue what to do. with debian, I usually do.

[16:42] <gaal> screen++ indeed

[16:43] * Juerd is considering using utf-32 because it compresses extremely well... ;)

[16:43] <jrockway> why isn't there a utf-24?

[16:43] <gaal> may I propose for that purpose UTF-64

[16:44] <moritz> jrockway: because 24 isn't 2^n, n integer ;-)

[16:44] <moritz> jrockway: and computer scientists love powers of 2

[16:44] <xinming_> utf-8 here is for historical reasons. And I think It will last a really long time except all server using utf-32 to send http header

[16:44] *** lichtkind joined
[16:44] <jrockway> utf-8 is a good idea

[16:44] <Juerd> UTF-32 is generally a bad idea

[16:44] <jrockway> it's efficient for most stuff

[16:44] <gaal> historical reasons are sometimes very good ones

[16:44] <jrockway> and everythign understands it

[16:45] <jrockway> it's just inefficient for things like "strlen <utf8-text>"

[16:45] <Juerd> UTF-32 is senseless for normal text. Its use is limited to academic context, I think.

[16:45] <Juerd> jrockway: With proper caching, that's not as big a problem as you'd think.

[16:45] <TimToady> and at the grapheme level you *still* have a variable-width encoding.

[16:46] <gaal> Juerd: uh, is "normal text" "English" under that definition?

[16:46] <Juerd> gaal: Any current language

[16:46] <gaal> er, s/definition/claim/

[16:46] <moritz> Juerd: why? it's really easy to work with, and with non-european charsets 2^26 chars are sometimes not enough

[16:46] <Juerd> gaal: Including Chinese(!)

[16:46] <moritz> s/26/16/

[16:46] <jrockway> a lot of stuff is still ASCII

[16:46] <jrockway> optimizing for ASCII isn't a bad idea

[16:46] <Juerd> I suggest that you read Wikipedia's articles about UTF-16 and UTF-32 respectively.

[16:46] <moritz> jrockway: as non-english speaker I can't agree

[16:47] <jrockway> moritz: well, what charset is this conversation using?

[16:47] <Juerd> moritz: It doesn't help to optimize for ASCII if that doesn't hurt non-ASCII.

[16:47] <moritz> Juerd: ok, I'll do it

[16:47] *** justatheory joined
[16:47] <jrockway> freenode would require 4x bandwidth if it switched to utf-32

[16:47] <moritz> jrockway: I don't know what you are using ;-)

[16:47] <jrockway> that would suck, because 99% of the conversations are ascii

[16:47] <moritz> jrockway: no, because of compression

[16:47] <jrockway> and the rest are iso-2022-jp :)

[16:48] <moritz> ä

[16:48] <jrockway> maybe

[16:48] <jrockway> extra CPU time

[16:48] <Juerd> jrockway: If IRC was updated to use UTF-anything, it could also be updated to use gzip

[16:48] <jrockway> with utf-8/ascii it can just blindly pass the bits around

[16:48] *** bernhard joined
[16:48] <jrockway> yeah

[16:48] <Juerd> So the bandwidth argument, for IRC, is a very silly one :)

[16:48] *** iblechbot joined
[16:48] <jrockway> i'm just saying that optimizing for ASCII isn't a bad idea

[16:48] <Juerd> The problem with IRC is that it sends almost no metadata :)

[16:49] <jrockway> it might not be a good idea either

[16:49] <Juerd> For IRC to support ASCII-incompatible encodings, you'd have to switch at some point

[16:50] *** forsaken joined
[16:50] <moritz> Juerd: but irc _does_ support encodings differnt from ascii, doesn't it?

[16:50] <avar> you could just send it along with MAXNICKLEN and such

[16:51] <wolverian> moritz, well, if "completely ignoring" can be defined as "supporting" :)

[16:51] <avar> irc is a line-based protocol where you send arbitary octets over

[16:51] <Juerd> moritz: Not for the protocol itself.

[16:51] <Juerd> The IRC protocol is strictly ASCII.

[16:51] <moritz> Juerd: ok, but for content

[16:51] <avar> no it's not

[16:52] <Juerd> moritz: Well, as long as it doesn't contain ASCII's control characters. That excludes UTF-16 and -32.

[16:52] <avar> the only protocol irc knows about is that swedish variant of whatever the hell

[16:52] *** prly joined
[16:52] <Juerd> avar: That's ASCII, where {}[] are mapped to other letters :)

[16:59] <jerrylee> why is it written in Haskell?

[17:00] <moritz> one possible answer could be "because audrey wanted to learn haskell"

[17:00] <jrockway> i think the offical reason is "the Reader monad"

[17:00] <jrockway> :)

[17:00] <jerrylee> is it going to be perl6 in future?

[17:00] <moritz> another could be "because it's good for fast buttom-up dev"

[18:44] <fglock> I've got objects working in p6-in-parrot (for some value of "objects")

[18:45] <fglock> there is some hope for mp6

[19:55] <moritz> is there a good reason why perl6.vim hilights kv in a different color than keys?

[20:03] <gaal> probably not.

[20:04] <DarkWolf84> maybe it's just a bug

[20:05] <moritz> DarkWolf84: "bug" is a rather harsh word for that ;-)

[20:05] <moritz> kv is listed as "p6KeyPropoerty", whereas keys is a "p6KeyFunc"

[20:05] <DarkWolf84> well then mistake is the word

[20:06] <gaal> "oversight"

[20:06] <gaal> commits welcome

[20:14] <fglock> would someone review a p6 snippet? http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/v6-MiniPerl6/temp/p6parrot-class.pl

[20:15] <fglock> I'm trying to emulate some missing features in p6-parrot

[20:26] <gaal> what's the arg for the closure for?

[20:26] <gaal> also I think you need {...}(), not ()()

[20:26] <fglock> gaal: () seems to be a syntax error

[20:27] <evalbot_r15886> "moose"

[20:27] <fglock> also, it doesn't work without 'my $var'

[20:27] <gaal> ?eval {"moose"}()

[20:27] <evalbot_r15886> "moose"

[20:27] <fglock> no, that's perl6-in-parrot :)

[20:28] <fglock> I'm working around

[20:29] <fglock> parrot-0.4.10 from cpan

[20:29] <gaal> so it's ( {} ).() and the () is just for grouping? not sure if that should work...?

[20:29] <fglock> yes, it works here

[20:33] <fglock> hmm - I'll try it in pugs

[20:34] <fglock> no, it only works on parrot - strange
