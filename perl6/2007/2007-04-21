[00:00] <TimToady> thorat: do you have a commit bit?

[00:00] <thorat> nope

[00:00] <TimToady> would you like one?

[00:00] <thorat> sure, thanks, how does it work?

[00:00] <TimToady> you /msg me your email, and I send you one

[00:01] <TimToady> (or most anyone else here can do it)

[00:01] <TimToady> you add yourselve to AUTHORS and that makes you an author.

[00:02] <TimToady> you want to be "thorat" there?

[00:03] <thorat> TimToady: no, make it Thorvaldur Thorvaldsson, or just Thorvaldur

[00:03] <TimToady> commit bit sent

[00:03] <thorat> TimToady: does the darcs checkout usually build? (it didn't when I tried a few weeks back)

[00:04] <thorat> thanks

[00:04] <TimToady> dunno, I've only ever used the svn

[00:04] *** zgh joined
[00:04] <thorat> ok, I'll try that then

[00:04] <TimToady> a lot of folks around here swear by (and at) svk

[00:04] <veritos> and also does the libghc6-pugs-dev package include everything required to compile pugs?

[00:05] <veritos> TimToady: and the rest of us write our own :)

[00:05] <thorat> wow, that's a debian package (-pugs-dev). Cool

[00:05] <veritos> thorat: so does that have everything needed?

[00:05] <TimToady> I don't know if that contains the extras you need

[00:05] <TimToady> anyone?

[00:05] <thorat> I'll figure it out

[00:06] <veritos> let's try compiling. it didn't even get thru setup before.

[00:06] <offby1> I build pugs with just the "ghc" package.

[00:06] <offby1> well, maybe some other packages, but if so, the build failures made it pretty clear which ones I needed

[00:06] * offby1 is probably mixing up pugs with parrot

[00:08] <veritos> yeah that worked, but you have to install libperl5.8 and libperl-dev manually also

[00:09] <thorat> ok, thanks

[00:09] <veritos> let's get to the real compile for now.

[00:13] * veritos has to install Task::Smoke first tho

[00:14] <thorat> TimToady: hmmm, I used thorat instead of Thorvaldur as nick, it worked, does that complicate anything?

[00:15] <thorat> TimToady: wasn't the user name in the email just a recommendation?

[00:15] <TimToady> nope that's fine

[00:15] <thorat> ok ;)

[00:15] <TimToady> I guess

[00:15] <TimToady> I don't know how CommitBit works really

[00:15] <TimToady> I'm just the Chief Cargo Culter around here...

[00:23] *** buetow joined
[00:24] <veritos> wow, i guess having an up to date GHC makes compilation faster.

[00:25] <thorat> veritos: do you know it is ok to do make -j2

[00:25] <thorat> (is there any reason to think otherwise?)

[00:25] <offby1> ghc 6.6 generates _alarmingly_  faster binaries than 6.4 did, too

[00:29] <veritos> thorat: i make -j4.

[00:29] <veritos> that's the BSD suuggestion

[00:29] <thorat> ok, I'll do that next time

[00:29] <thorat> (I have a dual-core machine)

[00:30] <thorat> [105 of 112]...

[00:42] <thorat> well, it compiled and linked (AFAICT) but the make run didn't complete gracefully.  I think it just has to do with some javascript stuff.  Anyway, I used darcs, I'll take a look at svk.  And Test::Smoke.

[07:08] <agentzh> or we can run it on feather.

[07:09] <agentzh> so you don't have to.

[07:09] <agentzh> if you don't mind

[07:12] <moritz> agentzh: my suggestion is that you let me refactor part of it, implement one or two features, and then I'll give you a dump of the databaseI assembled, and you install it on feather

[07:13] <moritz> agentzh: but right now this is a bbad idea because I don't have a feather account, so it's hard for me to track things if they break

[07:16] <agentzh> we need better log search than that of colabti.de

[07:19] <moritz> I never searched through the logs ;)

[07:19] <moritz> for that I use my plain textirri logs and grep ;)

[14:23] <rindolf> ingy: well, I hope you get better.

[14:23] <rindolf> ingy: if you need someone to do some emergency hacking for you - let me know.

[14:24] <rindolf> ingy: what happened to the car driver?

[14:27] <agentzh> laye: which version of activeperl are you using?

[14:27] <agentzh> laye: jerrylee seems to have problems with activeperl 5.8.8 build 820 + v6.pm

[14:28] <jerrylee> agentzh: I already give up 5.8.8 b820

[14:28] <agentzh> jerrylee: okay :)

[14:28] <jerrylee> agentzh: after that I can do things correctly ;)

[14:29] <agentzh> but there are still some people using that version of perl. :)

[14:30] * agentzh remembers migrating from activeperl 5.8.7 to 5.8.8 gave me a lot of troubles when he was still in Win32.

[14:30] <agentzh> *gave him

[14:33] *** Lunchy joined
[14:33] <jerrylee> agentzh: i think 5.8.8 is not good for running v6 ;)

[14:33] <agentzh> jerrylee: but it used to work according to [particle]

[14:33] <jerrylee> agentzh: really? why my machine ...

[14:34] <ingy> back

[14:34] <agentzh> no idea...

[14:34] <ingy> the car was fine

[14:34] <agentzh> lol

[14:34] <ingy> ingy took the brunt

[14:35] <agentzh> ingy: i hope you will drive slower in the future ;)

[14:36] <agentzh> (you were even answering my questions here right before the accident.)

[14:37] <ingy> yeah I was speeding

[14:37] <agentzh> wow

[14:37] <laye> agentzh: 5.8.8 b820

[14:37] * ingy likes to go fast

[14:37] <agentzh> laye: same as jerrylee!

[14:37] <ingy> like RIcky Bobby

[14:37] <laye> agentzh: any runable version

[14:37] * agentzh would rather ingy go fast on hacking

[14:37] <jerrylee> laye: you finished mission impossible for me

[14:37] <rindolf> ingy: I'm not going to be your friend anymore!

[14:38] <agentzh> (and internet ;))

[14:38] <rindolf> ingy: I don't like you anymore!

[14:38] <rindolf> ingy: so it was your fault?

[14:38] <agentzh> lol

[14:38] <ingy> I doubt it

[14:38] <rindolf> At times like this I'm glad I don't have a driver's licence.

[14:38] <laye> jerrylee: i didn't finished it either :-(

[14:39] <rindolf> I hate the concept of private cars.

[14:39] <rindolf> 1000's of men driving each in his own car.

[14:39] <agentzh> laye: try out 5.8.7 b813?

[14:39] <ingy> the uy was doin a uturn on a major street

[14:39] <jerrylee> laye: i see

[14:39] <rindolf> ingy: I see.

[14:39] <laye> agentzh: okay~

[14:40] <ingy> I just remembering hitting the brakes hard

[14:40] <ingy> then nothing

[14:40] <agentzh> laye: i recommend you use msi :)

[14:40] <laye> agentzh: thanks~

[14:40] <jerrylee> laye: i used msi too

[14:40] <jerrylee> it's working now

[14:40] <jerrylee> pugs rocks

[14:40] <agentzh> :D

[14:40] <jerrylee> perl6 is really amazing

[14:41] <agentzh> perl6++

[14:41] <jerrylee> read and print  pugs -v in 3 lines 

[14:41] <agentzh> (chromatic will tend to correct me maybe)

[14:42] <agentzh> ingy: please don't hack too much before you fully recover :)

[14:42] <jerrylee> i doubt if any language can do that in less code

[14:42] <agentzh> ingy: i really like your cool stuff like Test::Base. so take care of yourself ;)

[14:42] <agentzh> ingy: i'm looking forward to something even cooler from you ;)

[14:43] <agentzh> jerrylee: haskell tends to produce less code :)

[14:44] <agentzh> jerrylee: it's extremely concise.

[14:44] <jerrylee> agentzh: really? paring data into array?

[14:44] <agentzh> but very hard to learn.

[14:44] <agentzh> jerrylee: i think so :)

[14:44] <jerrylee> cool

[14:45] <agentzh> i think that's why audreyt chose haskell for pugs.

[14:45] <jerrylee> hard to learn is big issue to me

[14:45] <jerrylee> ;)

[14:45] <agentzh> jerrylee: mind you, even larry has tried 7 or 8 times to learn it.

[14:46] <jerrylee> agentzh: well, then I will follow you guys on perl6/pugs, haskell is left for you guys ;)

[14:46] <agentzh> iirc, audreyt once said, "to master haskell, you have to get your brain rewired."

[14:47] <spinclad> ingy: heal well, i send your body my best wishes

[14:49] <jerrylee> agentzh: my brain has too many wires

[14:49] * agentzh too.

[14:49] <offby1> wel'll remove some for you.

[14:50] <jerrylee> :D haha

[14:51] <agentzh> okay, i've confirmed pugs smoke is working again (with YAML::Syck 0.85).

[14:52] <agentzh> both on my machine and feather.

[14:52] <agentzh> it's taken so much time...

[14:53] <agentzh> please ensure you're not using YAML::Syck 0.84 since it has a serious bug.

[16:29] <rindolf> xahlee: and various POSIX:: functions and stuff.

[19:55] *** comet joined
[19:56] <comet> Hello, I've just compiled Pugs from svn, but I appear to have problems. When I attempt to use pugs to run any of the tests it tries to use the perl5 Test module

[19:58] <rindolf> comet: hmmm...

[19:58] <comet> and apparently make install garbled the workings of perl (5), so that for example 'cpan' no longer starts because Perl6 modules got put into @INC

[19:58] <moritz> comet: can you nopaste the error message along with the output of pugs -V?

[19:58] <comet> sure

[19:58] <moritz> did you do a "make install"?

[19:59] <comet> yes

[19:59] <moritz> that's generally discouraged, but I don't know if that is mentioned in README or someplace else ;)

[20:01] <moritz> but if perl5 doesn't work properly pugs will have problem sas well

[20:01] <comet> ouch. Alright. Well I still would like to make pugs work somehow, currently it does this: http://rafb.net/p/bF65JA90.html

[20:01] <lambdabot> Title: Nopaste - pugs error

[20:02] <comet> if not make install, what is the recommended way of using Pugs?

[20:02] <moritz> the first is to run it in-place where it's built

[20:03] <moritz> and what I do is I build my own debian packages and install them ;)

[20:04] <moritz> comet: actually I get the same errors when running pugs t/$test, but it works when I run "make smoke"

[20:06] <comet> hm. so I guess I should neglect running tests then :)

[20:07] <comet> thanks

[20:20] <gaal> it's not that it's discouraged per se, but people here don't often do it because they run out of the build dir. In fact, if anyone experiences breakage with make install that's certainly a bug, and should be fixed.

[20:22] <gaal> as for the error: make sure to run "./pugs" and not "pugs"; and export PERL6LIB=blib6/lib (or the csh equivalent)
