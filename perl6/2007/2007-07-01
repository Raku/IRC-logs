[10:19] <ayrnieu> I wonder how PHP people could get so annoyed with Perl6, when *every other language* is better than theirs.  Why don't they against Emacs Lisp?

[10:20] <ayrnieu> also, rail against.

[10:20] <Alias_> I think it might just be that the exploit used is in phpbb

[10:20] <Alias_> griefers are griefers

[10:21] <lumi> ayrnieu: Rail against? Is that a pun?

[10:22] *** isaacd joined
[10:24] *** barney joined
[10:25] <ayrnieu> lumi - no.

[10:26] <ayrnieu> although I had to read across your question for a fourth time to see that you didn't ask if it was a *gun* -- it is not a pun.

[10:26] <lumi> Not a rail gun, a Rails pun

[10:27] <lumi> What exploit is that?

[10:27] <Alias_> no idea

[10:27] <Alias_> #perl on irc.perl.org was mentioning it

[10:29] <ayrnieu> lumi - from the talk since these attacks began, these griefers use PHP, advocate PHP, harasss some !PHP... via exploits in deployed, representative PHP projects.

[10:30] <lumi> Oh, they connect to IRC via a PHPBB exploit?

[10:30] <ayrnieu> makes you want to stop sinning and take up PHP right now, doesn't it?

[10:31] <lumi> Not really fair, there could be exploits on any widely deployed software

[10:32] <lumi> I'm always much more impressed by good PHP code than good $something_else code

[10:32] <Alias_> Because it's so hard?

[10:32] <lumi> Exactly

[10:34] <ayrnieu> lumi - no: just as all languages are not equal in power, so are all languages not equal in security.

[10:37] <ayrnieu> Subshelling: many systems give you a wrapper to 'system', as PHP does, and tell you to be careful.  Better systems give you an as-easy wrapper to 'execve'.

[10:38] <Alias_> execve?

[10:38] <ayrnieu> Database access: PHP's mysql API (contrast: their postgresql api) doesn't have placeholders.

[10:40] <lumi> Instead, they SQL escape form input, ISTR

[10:40] <ayrnieu> lumi - yes, which is an utterly crap ideaa.

[10:40] <ayrnieu> alias - invoke a program with given (even unto $ARGV[0]) argv  and envp.

[10:41] <Alias_> ah

[10:41] <Alias_> handy that

[10:41] <Alias_> Do we have that?

[10:41] <Alias_> I could actually use that

[10:42] <ayrnieu> Alias - Perl's system() and exec() take %ENV and don't allow for a given $ARGV[0]

[10:42] <Alias_> lumi: It gets better

[10:42] <Alias_> lumi: I talked to rasmus

[10:42] <Alias_> At linux conf au

[10:42] <Alias_> And he decided that tainting sucked

[10:42] <Alias_> So instead he implemented a "data firewall"

[10:43] <Alias_> Which means, by default, PHP simply doesn't accept any characters outside of 

[10:43] <Alias_> \w as input

[10:43] <Alias_> And you have to "turn on" support for various characters

[10:43] <Alias_> *head*desk*

[10:45] <b_jonas> ouch. that sucks.

[10:47] *** buetow joined
[10:48] <lumi> They're very good at finding wrong solutions to problems, I guess

[10:51] <b_jonas> though of course I'm quite good at that as well

[10:51] <b_jonas> I had a cgi written in shell and awk and other shell utils that let you download files from a tree

[10:51] <b_jonas> and list directories

[10:51] <b_jonas> the same thing as the webserver does anyway

[10:52] <b_jonas> except much more unsecurely of course

[10:52] <b_jonas> and I wrote a stupid webpage loader without LWP once that spawned netcat to make the connection

[10:52] <b_jonas> well that was really stupid of me

[10:53] <b_jonas> that letter one was in perl

[10:54] *** utopia joined
[11:00] <Alias_> I just discovered today I've been using $^X badly

[11:01] <Alias_> Since you aren't supposed to use $^X to call "the perl currently running"

[16:33] <rindolf> avar: can you tell me what is 'set' magic in the context of http://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi.html ?

[16:47] <TimToady> set magic is what makes magic variables have extra semantics.  for example, setting an environment variable also modifies the process's environment, and setting elements of %SIG changes your signal handlers

[16:51] <TimToady> lidden: pugs should not accept 4 ! with a space; that's a bug by the current spec, though it was correct by an ancient version of the spec, before we made a hard rule about no space before postfix

[16:51] *** bonesss joined
[16:52] <TimToady> also -1! is incorrect; it should be parsed as -(1!), since postfix should default to same prec as ++

[16:53] <TimToady> and, of course $a ++ is also illegal

[16:57] *** zamolxes joined
[16:57] <TimToady> lidden: by the way, welcome aboard!
