[02:32] <rindolf> Hi all.

[02:32] <thorat> hello

[02:32] <rindolf> Hi thorat 

[02:32] <rindolf> thorat: what is your claim to fame?

[02:33] <thorat> uh, none

[02:34] <thorat> and you? ;)

[02:34] <rindolf> thorat: http://www.shlomifish.org/

[02:34] <lambdabot> Title: Shlomi Fish' Homepage

[02:34] <rindolf> thorat: that contains links to everything.

[02:35] <rindolf> thorat: do you have a Pugs commit bit?

[02:35] <rindolf> lambdabot: hi.

[02:35] <rindolf> lambdabot is impolite.

[02:36] <thorat> nope

[02:36] <thorat> how big is it now?

[02:36] <thorat> pugs that is?

[02:37] <thorat> I'll take a look and see if I can cruft it up a little bit ;)

[02:38] <rindolf> thorat: there's a lot of code there.

[02:38] <rindolf> They are in over r10K

[02:38] <thorat> yes, and Haskell

[02:39] <thorat> that means 1000K of equivalent C right? 

[02:39] <rindolf> 15446

[02:39] <rindolf> thorat: who knows.

[02:39] <rindolf> But maybe.

[02:39] <rindolf> Of course, Haskell has some implementation problems.

[02:39] <rindolf> ghc can only be compiled by a recent version of itself.

[02:40] <thorat> well I've managed to compile it; and there are nightly's as well

[02:40] <thorat> if you really need the bleeding edge

[02:42] <rindolf> I know.

[02:42] <thorat> and 6.6 is installed on my debian

[02:42] <rindolf> But I also found Haskell impractical in many respects.

[02:42] <rindolf> Some algorithms cannot be implemented in it well.

[02:42] <rindolf> thorat: I have 6.6 here on MDV Cooker too.

[02:42] <thorat> the stateful ones I guess

[02:42] <rindolf> thorat: yeah.

[02:43] <thorat> the imperative ones that is

[02:43] <rindolf> Or ones that use array.

[02:43] <rindolf> I got you.

[02:43] <thorat> I've not used Haskell at all, but read a lot about it; lot's of papers

[02:43] <thorat> lots

[02:44] <rindolf> thorat: I wrote stuff in Haskell.

[02:44] <thorat> I'm like that; I read a lot about programming but don't really program much outside of work

[02:44] <rindolf> Nothing too serious, but stilll.

[02:44] <rindolf> thorat: what do you do at work?

[02:45] <thorat> at the moment, I'm writing Perl; but I'm mostly at school this winter

[02:45] <thorat> before that I was programming Pocket PC

[02:45] <thorat> win32 api programming in C++

[02:46] <rindolf> Heh.

[02:46] <rindolf> Yes, I remember the Win32 API programming.

[02:47] <rindolf> I once programmed a clock for it for the Technion.

[02:47] <rindolf> Got 99% at that course.

[02:47] <thorat> ok

[02:47] * thorat just googled Technion

[02:48] <thorat> yes, it's more fun than MFC IMO

[02:49] <thorat> it's a functional API, really

[07:18] <Aankhen``> "Unicode horizontal whitespace is counted as whitespace, but it's better not to use thin spaces where they will make adjoining tokens look like a single token." # I smell... obfuscation! =)

[07:19] <gaal> hey Aankhen``! :)

[07:19] <Aankhen``> :-D

[07:19] <Aankhen``> Hacked anything interesting lately?

[07:19] <gaal> not really

[07:20] <Aankhen``> Awww.

[07:20] <Aankhen``> Ah well, there's plenty of time. =)

[07:20] <Aankhen``> I've been re-reading synopses.  Still not grokking multislices though. :-(

[07:20] <gaal> Aankhen``: re that thought, there was the proposal of Acme::Oneliner that encodes any program *really* in one line

[07:20] <Aankhen``> I suppose it would help if I weren't half-asleep.

[07:20] <Aankhen``> Heh, that would be fun.

[07:20] <gaal> with zero-width whitespace

[07:21] <Aankhen``> Yowza.

[07:21] <gaal> essentially, the file size encodes the program.

[07:21] <gaal> because you turn the program into a unary number, and prepend "use Acme::Oneliner;" to it. :-)

[07:21] <Aankhen``> Zero-width space as in U+200B?

[07:22] <gaal> yeah

[07:22] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[07:22] <Aankhen``> That would be so evil.

[07:22] <Aankhen``> I'd forgotten that character even exists.

[07:22] <gaal> you can compress this; there are three other zero-width chars.

[07:23] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[07:23] <gaal> that's okay, it's hard to lose it among all those widful characters

[07:23] * Aankhen`` nods.

[07:23] <Aankhen``> I thought hair spaces were about as thin as it gets.

[07:24] <Aankhen``> Sorry if hair spaces don't actually exist... like I said, I'm half asleep, so I might be imagining things. 8-|

[07:25] <gaal> otters have about 1k hairs in 1 sq. mm, so hairthin can be pretty thin.

[07:25] <Aankhen``> o_O

[07:25] <Aankhen``> Scary thought.

[07:25] <Aankhen``> Hmm, no wonder animators have such a hard time with hair.

[07:26] <Tene> So do I keep hacking on trying to implement a blessed string, or do I give up and re-implement URI.pm while translating to p6?

[07:26] <Aankhen``> "re-implement URI.pm while translating to p6" == "port URI.pm to Perl 6"?

[07:27] *** Belaf joined
[07:27] <gaal> blessed string? I think you want a role that "does" Str...?

[07:27] <gaal> but MO isn't totally landed yet so it prolly won't work completely.

[07:28] <Tene> Yeah, p5 URI is a blessed string, and the methods modify $$self

[07:28] <gaal> .oO( p5 does not have blessable strings, it has blessable scalars )

[07:28] <Tene> Hmm.  I misunderstand, I suppose.

[07:29] <gaal> let me look at the source...

[07:29] <Tene> in _init

[07:29] <Tene> my $self = bless \$str, $class;

[07:30] <gaal> okay, that's a scalar that happens to contain a string

[07:30] <gaal> you bless the container, not the string

[07:31] <Tene> Ahh.  I misunderstood.

[07:31] <gaal> well, the reference to the container, anyway

[07:31] <Tene> nodnod

[07:32] <Tene> I don't think I quite know enough to implement this correctly in the most useful way.

[07:32] <gaal> then implement this incorrectly in a still somewhat useful way

[07:32] <gaal> and people will make it correct and more useful :)

[20:57] <moritz> Jedai: my original implementation was in C, so it was not perlish at all - just fast in C ;-)

[20:57] <Jedai> it cut the execution time by at least a factor three

[20:57] <Jedai> Everything is fast in C !

[20:58] <moritz> not quite, if you scale it to the $n-Queen's Problem ;)

[20:58] <Jedai> See problem91.t for an algorithm who ought to be fast (it's not even backtracking) but is slowed down by implementation issues

[20:59] <Jedai> (I guess all those objects aren't so light...)

[20:59] <Jedai> moritz: Yeah, the new code should scale better I think

[20:59] <Jedai> even in C

[21:01] <moritz> would be an interesting comparison - afaict there are more array operations and less backtracking involved...

[21:01] <moritz> I guess as long as all arrays fit into the cache it's faster ;)

[21:02] <Jedai> Yeah, and then slower if it doesn't

[21:02] <Jedai> for sure !! :D

[21:06] <Jedai> Well on my computer for the 8-Queen's Problem it went from 1'40" to 20' so I changed it, maybe I should have put both method in. I lack experience in this field (contributing an Open Source project)

[21:06] <Jedai> What do you think ?

[21:07] <moritz> Jedai: no, it's fine... the best method wins ;)

[21:07] <moritz> Jedai: and the old one still lives in the SVN repository  - if somebody really cares ;-)

[22:15] <Aankhen``> Jedai: :!b is supposed to be equivalent to a => 0 in P5.

[22:15] <Aankhen``> Er.

[22:15] <Aankhen``> b => 0.

[22:15] <Aankhen``> Not a => 0.

[23:03] <Jedai> ?eval $a = "o"; <<a $a b>>

[23:03] <evalbot_r15810> ("a", "o", "b")

[23:03] <Juerd> IIRC, it even splits variables if they're not quoted

[23:03] <Juerd> ?eval $a = "o o"; <<f $a>>

[23:03] <evalbot_r15810> ("f", "o", "o")

[23:04] <Juerd> ?eval $a = "o o"; <<f "$a">>

[23:04] <evalbot_r15810> ("f", "o o")

[23:04] <Juerd> Just like shells do.

[23:04] <Jedai> Cool (but confusing)

[23:04] <Juerd> Not confusing once you know it :)

[23:04] <Juerd> And since many of us use shells all the time, we'll probably as a community learn the semantics quickly :)

[23:05] <Jedai> I guess you can think of it as a 2-step process, like the regex interpolation in Perl5

[23:06] <Juerd> Don't remind me of that.

[23:07] <Juerd> Because it reminds me of /$foo/ in Perl 6 being /"$foo"/ rather than /<$foo>/

[23:07] <Juerd> So that's a slight inconsistency between // and <<>>

[23:13] <Jedai> The regex interpolation in Perl6 is much better off like IMHO

[23:14] <Jedai> Since that's what most people expect when they first encounter it in Perl5

[23:17] <Juerd> I doubt both the reasoning and the validity

[23:20] <Aankhen``> Oh, I guess I misunderstood the angles.

[23:20] <Aankhen``> Thanks. :-)

[23:20] <Jedai> My experience with Perl newbies (which aren't always that bright anyway) seems to suggest so. But I never taught Perl formally, so I guess you might know better.

[23:22] <Aankhen``> Error: Range operation compromised due to sorting of delta after gamma.  Burst into flames? (y/y)

[23:24] <dduncan> question, what is the MANIFEST.SKIP entry to match any file containing parenthesis?  a line with just \( doesn't seem to work

[23:25] <Jedai> Is there a way to write a lazy iterator in Pugs actually, to get the same behaviour as filehandles ?

[23:30] <Jedai> Well I can write a lazy iterator, you're right in this sense, don't duck ! ;) But at a syntaxical level I wondered if I could use it in a for like a "=filehandle"

[23:56] <moritz> what's the error?

[23:57] <moritz> and is it intended that $<ident> is undef (instead of, eg an array of match object)?
