[11:58] <mncharity> Tene: re xnest, many thanks for mention it.  I've been facing a problem developing on qemu, with the qemu emulated hardware not supporting the needed monitor mode.  Xephyr, while a bit slow and buggy, looks like it does the trick.  I expect it to be a great help.  Thank you! :)

[16:19] <pmurias> hi

[16:26] <lusher00> i have a program that requires pcat.pm to compile but when I try to compile this program it complains.  I was wondering if someone could help me

[16:27] *** rintaro_ is now known as rintaro

[17:00] <Jmax> complains how

[17:01] <lusher00> hold on

[17:02] <lusher00> Can't locate loadable object for module Net::Pcap in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i486-linux /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl .) at ./aimSniff.pl line 36

[17:02] <lusher00> BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./aimSniff.pl line 36.

[17:02] <Jmax> perl 5 problem

[17:02] <Jmax> this is #perl6

[17:02] <Jmax> furthermore, you just need to install the module

[17:02] <Jmax> man cpan

[17:02] <lusher00> i installed it

[17:02] <lusher00> it is in there

[17:03] <Jmax> then there's more debugging to do

[17:03] <lusher00> otherwise there would have no problem

[17:03] <lusher00> sure is

[17:03] <lusher00> thats why im here

[17:03] <Jmax> but this isn't the right place to walk you through it

[17:03] <Jmax> try #perl

[17:03] <lusher00> thankyou

[17:03] <Jmax> you're welcome

[17:04] <Jmax> maybe the topic should say "Perl _6_, not Perl" or something similiar :)
