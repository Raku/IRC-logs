[06:36] <[particle]> thanks!

[06:36] * agentz1 grins.

[06:37] <PessimistByNatur> I would attempt to help, but seeing as I don't know much perl at all, and that I'm still learning how to program in general, I'll leave it in your capable hands ^_^

[06:37] <agentz1> heh

[06:38] *** jisom joined
[06:38] <moritz_> PessimistByNatur: that attidue fits your nick name ;-)

[06:39] <PessimistByNatur> I see no contradiction, as long as one can accept that one can't often control external circumstance, it's fairly simple to stay content even when you think everything will go wrong ^_^

[06:41] * moritz_ mumbles something inaudible about "low standards", but generally agrees

[16:01] <pmurias> ?

[16:01] <fglock> yes, fixing

[16:01] <fglock> thanks :)

[16:01] <pmurias> fglock: remove the eval while forcerecompiling

[16:02] <fglock> does it work without eval? 

[16:02] <fglock> I wonder how circular dependencies are resolved

[16:02] <pmurias> fglock: i can hand remove the bug and test

[16:02] <fglock> and self-references

[16:03] <pmurias> run_test.pl --backend=perl5rx works with kp6

[16:03] <pmurias> except for a test which was broken before

[16:07] <pmurias> transforming compiled code with vim is not nice,broke my image

[16:08] <pmurias> :(

[16:08] <pmurias> fglock: it should work the file has "no strict 'vars'"

[16:09] <fglock> but the interpolation will generate a ''

[16:09] <fglock> doesn't it?

[16:10] <pmurias> why?

[16:11] <pmurias> fglock: test 1-10 in t-bootstrap work

[16:11] <pmurias> * tests

[16:11] <pmurias> fglock: the var in (??{$var}) dosn't get interpolated

[16:12] <fglock> ok - I'll try it out after the fix

[16:12] <pmurias> ok

[16:13] <moritz_> now I get a segfault in 02-grammar.p6 even with perl5.10.0

[16:16] <pmurias> obra: i don't with perl5.8.8

[16:16] <pmurias> obra: sorry meant moritz_ 

[16:16] <pmurias> moritz_: i don't with perl5.8.8

[16:17] <moritz_> pmurias: on a different mashine with the same perl it works for me as well...

[16:17] <moritz_> pmurias: the odd thing is: otherwise it works perfectly fine, and the perl5.10 copy that I tried passed all tests

[16:17] <pmurias> moritz_: is it the segfaulty perl which gave a segfault before?

[16:18] <moritz_> pmurias: I reported the segfault before, yes ;)

[16:18] <moritz_> with the same mashine

[16:18] <moritz_> s/with/on/

[16:19] <moritz_> oh wait, now I can reproduce the segfault on a second debian box

[16:40] <fglock> hmm - the perl5.10 error message occurs in some "normal" code

[16:41] <fglock> it might be a code-inside-regex bug

[16:49] <fglock> no idea why

[16:50] <fglock> with 5.10.0-RC2

[16:52] <fglock> hmm - there are several reports of this bug - maybe it's not my fault

[16:54] <moritz_> the "previous thread" had some discussion on Carp::Heavy iirc

[16:55] <moritz_> though I lost interest in it because I didn't understand it at all
