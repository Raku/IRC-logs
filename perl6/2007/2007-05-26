[11:43] <renormalist> sometimes in P6 code there are things like :w  in open, or the conditions for grep:{ ...}.          What's that for a syntax with the ":"? Where do I find it's spec

[11:48] <spinclad> it's the adverb form of a pair: :w == {w => 1}; see S02:1982

[11:52] <ayrnieu> @eval {:a, :b, :c}

[11:53] <spinclad> your grep:{...} is something else though; perhaps @array.grep:{...} (look for 'invocant', i think)

[11:57] <renormalist> ?eval  {:a, :b, :c}

[11:57] *** evalbot_r16527 is now known as evalbot_r16530

[11:57] <evalbot_r16530> (("a" => Bool::True), ("b" => Bool::True), ("c" => Bool::True))

[11:58] <renormalist> spinclad: and it's yet another one when used as file test operators?

[11:58] <spinclad> example?

[11:59] <renormalist> $file ~~ :r     # file is readable

[11:59] <renormalist> or $file ~~ :f   # plaintext file

[11:59] <renormalist> etc.

[11:59] <renormalist> found in s16

[12:00] <renormalist> or it's the smartmatcher, that interpres right side adverb as file test when lieft side is filehandle

[12:01] <spinclad> that sounds likely

[12:02] <spinclad> S16? S26?

[12:04] <renormalist> S16, http://perlcabal.org/syn/S16.html#Filehandles%2C_files%2C_and_directories

[12:04] <lambdabot> Title: S16, http://tinyurl.com/ytd24h

[12:05] <spinclad> thanks, that one was off my radar

[12:05] <renormalist> ah. on the grep it's also an adverb form. With {...} the interpretation depends on sth., then it's closure or hash.

[12:06] *** buetow joined
[12:07] <renormalist> now I'm only not sure about my interpretation on the ~~ filetest. because in S16 they call it file test *operator*. No hint that its an adverb too

[12:10] <spinclad> (:r): S03:1478, special use of a Pair as either pattern or method name

[12:12] *** xinming joined
[12:13] <renormalist> there is a definition for ~~:

[12:13] <renormalist>     Any       Pair      test object             .:Xkey(Xval) (e.g. filetests)

[12:15] <spinclad> ( $filename ~~ :r  means  $filename.:r )

[12:16] <renormalist> ah, so it's a Pair that names the file test operator to use

[12:16] <renormalist> and the operator is its own thing

[12:17] <spinclad> using a Pair as method name seems odd to me, an overloading of the syntax i wouldn't have expected to work

[12:18] <renormalist> I already saw sth similar today in the spec, but can't find it again

[12:18] <spinclad> but it lets the filetest syntax work, and i expect that drives the grammar

[12:18] <spinclad> besides S03:1478?

[12:19] <spinclad> s/the grammar/the design/

[12:23] <renormalist> from which source do you read the synopses? I only use the html on spec.pugscode.org

[12:24] <renormalist> so I cant use linenumbers

[12:25] <spinclad> i have https://svn.perl.org/perl6 checked out, they appear under design/syn/ .

[12:25] <spinclad> sorry, URL: https://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk

[12:25] <spinclad> Repository Root: https://svn.perl.org/perl6

[12:27] <renormalist> k thx

[12:29] <spinclad> if you read moritz's irclog (http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/) i think references like S03:1478 become smartlinks into the spec (but my browser is bogged down atm, can't check)

[19:37] <smallfoot-> is Python or Ruby better than Perl(6) ?

[19:38] <Tene> smallfoot-: comparing it to DNF isn't really accurate.  If you watch the mailing list, svn commits, and IRC channel, you can see that the Perl 6 project is making a *lot* of progress.  There's no way to tell if anyone is working on DNF or not.

[19:38] <Tene> smallfoot-: depends on your needs/goals, but in general, no, they're not.

[19:40] <Tene> There isn't anything that python or ruby can do that Perl 6 can't do, and there are many things that Perl 6 can do that python and ruby can't conveniently or easily do.

[22:05] <renormalist> Is there something special in using/making the modules below ext/ ?

[22:05] <renormalist> When I perl Makefile.PL; make of modules with :: in name, then I get

[22:05] <renormalist> Makefile:521: *** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.

[22:06] <renormalist> E.g., try it in pugs/ext/Text-Glob     and in own empty experiments

[22:06] <moritz> renormalist: where do you do your "make"?

[22:06] <moritz> renormalist: I think you have to do one "make" in pugs' root directory

[22:06] <renormalist> within pugs/ext/Text-Glob

[22:06] <moritz> and after that, you can use make/make test locally within the module

[22:06] <renormalist> but I only want to write my own module

[22:07] <renormalist> globally make would take hours for the whole pugs, wouldn't it?

[22:07] <moritz> depends on your RAM

[22:07] <moritz> you can try "make soon"

[22:07] <moritz> that turns off ghc's optimization or something and consumes far less ram

[22:08] <moritz> and less CPU, but produces an inefficient pugs

[22:23] <moritz> DST is just there to make life harder for us programmers
