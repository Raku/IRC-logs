[00:02] <diakopter> maybe line endings were changed.

[00:04] <Limbic_Region> ah, that could be

[00:12] <unobe> Limbic_Region: svn diff -r PREV:HEAD works for me

[00:13] <unobe> is that just a shortcut for -r PREV?

[00:13] <unobe> nope, it's different

[00:13] *** nperez joined
[00:20] <Limbic_Region> unobe - I am only interested in a specific file

[00:20] <unobe> unobe: then just append the filename: svn diff -r PREV:HEAD filename

[00:20] <unobe> hehe oops

[00:20] <unobe> Limbic_Region: then just append the filename: svn diff -r PREV:HEAD filename

[00:20] <Limbic_Region> right

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> svn diff file -rPREV is shorter however

[00:21] <unobe> ah, well -r PREV will show the current changes that aren't versioned yet

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> I had just checked out HEAD though

[00:21] <unobe> o

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> but of course you are right

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> [19:56] <Limbic_Region> I just checked out and saw that it had been modified in the current version

[00:22] <unobe> oops, my bad

[00:22] <unobe> sorry

[00:22] * unobe needs to read instead of scan

[00:23] <diakopter> uses of 'scan' have shifted from antonyms of 'skim' to synonyms of 'skim'
