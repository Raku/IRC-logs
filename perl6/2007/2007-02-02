[02:30] <audreyt> $file ~~ :s > 42

[02:31] <audreyt> unfortunately, that is now chaincomp

[02:31] <audreyt> and eval as

[02:31] <audreyt> $file ~~ :s and :s > 42

[02:31] <audreyt> which is false

[02:31] <audreyt> unintended consequence?

[02:32] * allbery_b saw that go by and is somewhat glad the stupid parser issues are hopefully history now

[02:32] <allbery_b> frustrating

[02:32] <putter> re Inf, spec is IEEE.  and customization is needed because IEEE has had slosh, and because not everything has been IEEE.

[02:36] <putter> ashleyb: see http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine/ especially README.

[02:36] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 15164: /misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine, http://tinyurl.com/2d96yh

[02:36] <putter> Code is buried down in http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine/lib/Regexp/ModuleA.pm as is p5 current (unfortunate imho) practice.

[02:36] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/2fyhqj

[02:39] <ashleyb> putter: thank you

[02:39] <putter> goals: create a usuable p6 regex engine - we need one; create the first non-pugs parser - the pace of pugs's parser development is holding us up a bit; ideally have something which could be transliterated from p5 to p6 to get the parser part of a p6 implemented in p6.

[02:40] <putter> support parser development.

[02:40] <putter> I think that's about it.

[02:40] <putter> Written in p5.  I try to keep a "ways one can help" at the top of the README.

[02:41] <putter> There is also the main pugs "ways you can help" in http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/project_planning/TASKS

[02:43] <ashleyb> looking...

[02:45] <putter> history: the code is basically just the regex engine from the... Jan '06(?) regexp_engine_and_parser_spike, which got cleaned up slightly in... Fall '06? in the hope of making it more usable/attractive, and then overhauled with a new ast (instead of japhy's Regexp::Parser) starting a few days ago.

[02:45] *** dmq joined
[02:45] <ashleyb> what's wrong with fglocks Pugs::Compiler::Regex?

[02:46] <putter> slow.

[02:46] <ashleyb> I've been using that in production for a few months now (though I've got a few bugs I've been working around)

[02:46] <ashleyb> k

[02:46] <putter> neat!  it would be interesting to hear of your experiences.

[02:47] <putter> The cleanup was done in the hope that PCR might switch backends, but no one had the tuits or interest or something.

[02:48] <ashleyb> my needs are more for ease of implementation and of maintainability over speed

[02:48] <ashleyb> so I chose P::C::R over regular perl 5 regexs

[02:48] <ashleyb> (all my code is in perl 5)

[02:49] <ashleyb> but yes I do find it slow, but tolerable for what I want.

[02:49] *** pjcj joined
[02:50] <ashleyb> the funny bug with it is, is that instead of crashing (or throwing an error) it always hangs.

[02:50] <putter> good.  i imagine at some point it will simply start running faster.

[02:50] <ashleyb> which makes debugging interesting, but once you get the knack you can figure it out

[02:51] <putter> ah.  :/  hopefully that will improve too.

[02:51] <audreyt> TimToady: I'm going to assume that :d>10 will eventually raise a warning somehow and goahead committing the implementation.

[02:53] <ashleyb> putter: so how does P::C::Regex and yet_another_regex_engine go together?  is there something different of value in each?

[02:53] <ashleyb> putter: that they can be combined at one point?

[02:53] <putter> ashleyb: if you were interested in helping out this evening, I'm curious where the computes are going, but I think I'll spend tonight nudging the % test coverage up a bit.  If you wanted to run a profile...

[02:54] <putter> PCR runs p6 regex, yare only knows about p5 so far.

[02:54] <ashleyb> a profile of PCR?

[02:55] <putter> PCR's emitters could be changed to use the yare engine core (backtracking protocol, anonymous subs, and their factories)

[02:56] <putter> a profile off yet_another

[02:57] <putter> re combined, perhaps.  p6 is largely a bootstrapping game.  given n parts sort of working, how can we puzzle them together to make progress.

[02:59] <putter> re profile, eg dprofpp or whatever on  perl lib/Regexp/Module.pm --test

[03:01] <ashleyb> how do I get the yet_another code?

[03:01] <putter> eg, pwd misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine; perl -d:DProf lib/Regexp/ModuleA.pm --test > deleteme; dprofpp ...

[03:01] <putter> do you have a copy of pugs?

[03:02] <ashleyb> nope.

[03:02] <putter> have you used svn or cvs?

[03:02] <ashleyb> cvs a long time ago.

[03:02] <ashleyb> p4 mostly now

[03:02] <ashleyb> no svn/svk

[03:03] <putter> (someone check me on that)

[03:05] <ashleyb> hmmm that seems to be working :D

[03:05] <tene> you're right.

[03:05] <putter> then if you express even the slightest interest, someone give you a commit bit (to write back to the repository)

[03:06] <tene> Just as a warning, any response to that statement might be considered interest in having a commit bit.

[03:06] <putter> lol :)

[03:06] <putter> so true

[03:06] <ashleyb> I think I had one once -- but I'll ask again as soon as I have something to check in.

[03:06] <tene> Accidentally using an anagram of "commit" or "patch" can get a commit bit in your inbox.

[03:06] <ashleyb> haha

[03:07] *** mdiep joined
[03:07] <allbery_b> looking at the word "commit" or "patch" can land you a commit bit around here...

[03:07] <SamB> heh

[03:08] <SamB> but, you can't get a commit bit in your inbox without someone at least knowing your email address, can you?

[03:08] * SamB is safe because he already has one

[03:08] <ashleyb> the password is another matter...

[03:08] <ashleyb> :)

[03:11] <putter> from the top of README: prove ... tests and provides a nice summary; --test lets you watch the individual tests go by; and --repl lets you interactively play.

[03:16] <ashleyb> hi :D

[03:16] <putter> hi fglock :)

[03:17] <ashleyb> putter:ok so how do I run the profiler?

[03:17] <ashleyb> \

[03:19] <ashleyb> where is  lib/Regexp/Module.pm

[03:19] <putter> if you haven't looked at profiler output before, it can be rather a learning curve.

[03:19] <ashleyb> do I need to do a make?

[03:36] <putter> a month can't have passed already... are you still on vacation, but typing... (like audreyt's sleeping but committing;)

[03:37] <putter> oh, there are a whole lot of bugs in --test, that's the current exercise... :)

[03:37] <fglock> putter: I came back to the city for a wedding - I'm travelling again tomorrow :)

[03:38] <ashleyb> ah -- so fix the bugs and get the profile...?

[03:38] *** REPLeffect joined
[03:39] <putter> fglock: ah.  enjoy.

[03:41] <putter> ashleyb: probably most efficient for me to fix stuff.  though feel free.  warn me and I'll sync more often than once an evening.  if you wanted to profile it now, it's running slower than I expected, and am curious where the time is going.

[03:43] <putter> though for a first task (and a commit bit:), you might look at the project_planning/TASKS list.  some of those have much lower barriers to entry than doing a profiling exercise of code you haven't seen before.

[03:43] <ashleyb> what's svn for sync?

[03:43] <ashleyb> (i.e. how do I sync in svn?)

[03:43] <tene> svn up

[03:44] <tene> to send changes back, use 'commit'

[03:44] <tene> 'up' is short for 'update'

[03:44] <putter> re bugs, thanks for reminding me, i meant to edit README to mention the objective is 100%, or no worse than the underlying p5 implementation version.  older versions, more re_tests failures.  as we'll keep updating re_tests from the most recent p5.

[03:47] <putter> there's something about  s/\\([\\\'])/\\\\$1/g  I just find humorous.

[03:49] <putter> re 'commit', neat, didn't know that.  I always use  svn ci 

[03:49] <ashleyb> putter: it's about 8PM here.  and I've gotta decommute, so maybe I'll catch you tomorrow.  I've got revesion 15165 -- but it doesn't seem to give me any changes to misc/pX/Common/yet_another...

[06:43] <TimToady> audreyt: I'm wondering whether the base form is not .TEST(:X) but just .:X and we simply allow a type to define methods starting with :

[06:43] <TimToady> alternately, just make .:X a shorthand for .TEST(:X)

[06:44] <TimToady> then we don't have a precedence problem with $x.:s > 1024

[06:46] <TimToady> or maybe there's some other way to map a pair test to methodname space.

[06:46] <TimToady> the .TEST(:X) approach would tend to encourage people to use switch statements.

[06:47] <TimToady> the method :X approach would of course encourage method defs instead

[06:47] <TimToady> the latter would require a CANDO thing if you wanted to handle arbitrary pairs, while .TEST could handle that more easily.

[06:50] <TimToady> another possibility is :s(1_000_000..*) selectors, but that doesn't work so well for <=> comparisons
