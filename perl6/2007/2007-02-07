[00:22] <moritz> Limbic_Region: in the last comment on http://use.perl.org/~Aristotle/journal/30896 the example is really simple and non-scary => now I think I have an idea what that's all about ;)

[00:22] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of Aristotle (5147)

[00:26] <diotalevi> Y is simpler if you toss a few sacred cows out. Y isn't necessary if you're in Perl 6. :-)

[00:27] * Limbic_Region pointed to your discussion on the topic diotalevi

[00:27] <Limbic_Region> but I forgot the implicitness of it in Perl 6 as pointed out by stvn

[00:29] <diotalevi> Y's typical implementation a as combinator strives to have minimum (preferring zero) identifiers. In a simple Y I'd say C<< $p = { ... }; $p->( $p ) >> but that's against the goal of having unnecessary identifiers.

[00:30] <diotalevi> So you see {...}->( {...} ) with ... duplicated on both sides and that's hard to read. Purer though. I guess.

[13:19] <VanilleBert> delete @a, 2         is the same  as       @a[2] = undef    ??

[13:22] <VanilleBert> thought it should make @a to  [0, 1, 3, 4]

[13:24] <Limbic_Region> cj - winning what?

[13:24] <merlyn> why would perl6 have to be that much unlike perl5?

[13:25] <merlyn> (general lament) let's not break EVERYTHING we know about perl5 please!

[13:26] <Limbic_Region> VanilleBert - Are you looking at the S29 in the pugs repo?

[13:26] <cj> Limbic_Region: that's for you to decide of course :)

[13:26] <cj> merlyn!  ltns :)

[13:28] <merlyn> yeah delete there looks like it acts like perl5 delete

[13:28] <merlyn> which should NEVER have been allowed on an array

[13:28] <merlyn> stupid pseudohashes :(

[13:29] <merlyn> we create pseudohashes, we then have to build up all sorts of weird things on arrays, then we deprecate pseudohashes. :(

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> VanilleBert - http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/Functions.pod

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> grrr - I think I am lagging

[13:29] <Limbic_Region> in the event my text ever shows up, the only time delete works like splice apparently is if it happens at the end of an array - and then only if it doesn't violate another constraint

[13:32] <VanilleBert> i posted in the perl6-users mailinglist a "remove" function which just do what i expected from delete

[13:32] <merlyn> wow... why woudl someone be playing with perl6 in its current state if they have never used perl5?

[13:32] <merlyn> that's pretty ... amazin to me.

[13:32] <merlyn> is there a substantial crowd in that category?

[13:33] <merlyn> I suspect that 80% of the perl6 users were former perl5 users.

[13:33] <merlyn> maybe I'm way off

[13:33] <VanilleBert> yes :D it is amazing... just watching the development of a new language... thats interesting :D

[13:33] <merlyn> s/were/will be/

[13:34] <merlyn> if the number is more than 20% "new to perl", I might want to rethink how "Learnign Perl" for perl6 will look

[13:34] <cj> you could call it "Lurning Perl"

[13:34] <VanilleBert> perl5 didnt looked very well, i didnt like it from the first sight... but perl6 was different :D

[13:34] <qmole_> i'm not sure. i guess there's a lot of people from the haskell/fp crowd that were introduced to perl6 by pugs and haven't done all that much perl5

[13:35] *** shay joined
[13:35] <merlyn> how many of those will stick around when pugs goes away though?

[13:35] <cj> audreyt++

[13:35] <cj> pugs is going away!?

[13:35] <merlyn> I mean, haskell is nice, but it's not part of the final delivery

[13:35] <cj> yeah, I s'pose we're going to be bootstrapping ourselves eventually

[13:35] <merlyn> which will be perl6 written in perl6 compiling to parrot

[13:36] <Limbic_Region> ok, must be lagging again
