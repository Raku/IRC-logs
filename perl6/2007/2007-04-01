[00:06] <Jedai> I don't get an error running it in my Pugs, do you get this error in the pugs prompt too ?

[00:09] <Jedai> Besides I don't think that getting () for <ident> is intended, as S05 clearly state that it must be assigned an array of Match in this case

[00:12] *** prly joined
[00:15] <moritz> Jedai: no

[00:16] <Tene> In in t/oo/methods/overload.t there are two instances of 'mutli' where I would expect 'multi'

[00:16] <Tene> Can anyone confirm that that's a typo?

[00:18] <Tene> It also says "currently these classes do not compile", but if I replace mutli with multi, they seem to compile fine.

[00:19] <moritz> Tene: yeah, that's a typo I guess

[00:19] <Tene> okay to drop the eval?

[00:20] <moritz> yes

[00:21] <moritz> but they will still be declared as "todo" because of the run_tests_with routines

[00:21] <Tene> Well, then we get unexpectedly succeeding.

[00:21] <moritz> right

[00:25] * moritz tries to understand rules - very confusing

[00:25] <svnbot6> r15811 | tene++ | Typo fix.

[00:25] <svnbot6> r15811 | tene++ | Also, this code compiles fine now, so doesn't need to be hidden in an eval.

[00:25] <moritz> but not as confusing as the first time I read it

[00:25] <moritz> so I'll read it over and over again...

[00:25] <moritz> and after pass $n I'll understand 90%

[00:25] <moritz> say, $n ~~ 6

[00:26] <moritz> why does it complain that it can't parse the regex, but still returns a match object?

[00:26] <moritz> that's weird

[00:27] <Jedai> Well, I don't know where it comes from, since in my pugs it doesn't complain, it may be a bot bug there

[00:28] <moritz> Jedai: do you have r15810 pugs?

[00:28] <moritz> mine is only r15805 right now

[00:28] * Tene is updating right now to confirm

[00:28] <Jedai> I think I've done make with the r15808

[00:30] <moritz> ok

[00:30] <moritz> S05: say 'Full match context is: [$/]';

[00:30] <moritz> shouldn't that be double quotes?

[00:33] <moritz> can somebody confirm that single quotes are nonsense?

[00:35] <moritz> anyway, time for bed++ ;-)

[00:37] <Jedai> Good night :)

[00:37] <moritz> Jedai: thanks

[00:38] <Jedai> I'll be following your example...

[00:51] <dduncan> question: I understand that the .perl method of a value will generate Perl code that when evaluated will produce that value ... now, is there a similar method that produces a Perl AST for that code instead of the code as a string? ... eg, similar to what a macro definition could receive as input

[05:49] <Aankhen``> I was just trying out an example from S04.

[05:49] <audreyt> Aankhen``: I know :) but I wasn't quite able to figure out how to implement that, so I punted

[05:49] <Aankhen``> Heh, okay.

[21:38] <wolverian> don't try to compile pugs with 768mb of ram and no swap :)

[21:39] <moritz> wolverian: I guess it works... if you have no X and no firefox running...

[21:39] <moritz> wolverian: and no apache, no mysql etc ;-)

[21:39] <wolverian> yeah.. not the case on my laptop ;)

[21:40] <wolverian> (the no swap situation was an error)

[21:40] * moritz has only 448MB RAM, but a bit swap space

[21:40] <wolverian> okay, trying again with 1.5gb of swap..

[21:45] <sili> pugs made it to the ports collection. i'm excited

[21:45] <Limbic_Region> 768mb of physical memory should be plenty i think

[21:46] <Limbic_Region> if it is available anyway

[21:46] <wolverian> wasn't, but I had other large processes too

[21:46] <wolverian> probably only had around 400mb free

[21:46] <Limbic_Region> yeah, 512 is definately not enough

[21:48] <wolverian> yay, got past pugs.internals this time :)

[21:48] <wolverian> er, pugs.ast.internals

[22:07] <wolverian> eek

[22:07] <wolverian> Linking pugs.new ...

[22:07] <wolverian> /home/wolverian/Projects/pugs/third-party/installed/lib/Pugs-6.2.13/ghc-6.6/libHSPugs-6.2.13.a(p5embed.o): In function `pugs_SvToVal':

[22:07] <wolverian> p5embed.c:(.text+0x202f): undefined reference to `pugs_PvnToValUTF8'

[22:07] <wolverian> what did I break?

[22:10] <Limbic_Region> wolverian - does your env say anything about pugsembed ?

[22:10] <wolverian> no.

[22:10] <Limbic_Region> hrm

[22:10] <moritz> wolverian: when did you make your last realclean?

[22:10] <wolverian> moritz, I don't remember :)

[22:11] <wolverian> I'll just try that and come back in half an hour if it doesn't work... 

[22:12] <moritz> wolverian: that's always worth a try if pugs build fails - although it takes rather long :(

[23:29] <moritz> are there any more or less regular windows builds for pugs somewhere?

[23:34] <MaartenB> I have a problem with a procmail rule where I use perl for regular expressions, is this the right channel for such questions?

[23:36] <moritz> MaartenB: no, it's not

[23:36] <moritz> MaartenB: this is about perl 6 dev ;)

[23:36] *** gnuvince joined
[23:37] <MaartenB> moritz, ok, any suggestions about the right channel? #procmail is really silent, and I can't find any other regular expressions / perl / procmail based channels :)

[23:42] <moritz> MaartenB: there is #perl on irc.perl.org, but I don't know how much the like questions like that

[23:42] <moritz> MaartenB: but at leaste there somebody might have a better suggestion

[23:43] <MaartenB> thanks moritz
