[16:17] <InVaDeR_7> hi there

[16:17] <InVaDeR_7> i want a little help

[16:17] <InVaDeR_7> i use ubuntu

[16:18] <InVaDeR_7> and i want to check with perl if a process is running... and if not.. to run it

[16:18] <InVaDeR_7> it is easy ?

[16:19] <allbery_b> if it's not perl 6, try ##perl instead

[16:19] *** fglock left

[18:51] <pmurias> fglock: what do the containers have to support is it just FETCH and STORE or is it more?

[19:02] <pmurias> thought a bit about kp6-Moose, it might not be a bad idea if it was possible to do containers with tie and Data::Bind
