[01:04] <Caelum> the debian packages are pretty out of date

[01:04] <moritz> Caelum: if you want freshly built deb packages for i386 I could upload some

[01:05] <moritz> Caelum: they are just without the parrot backend, which is somewhat out of date as well ;)

[01:05] <Caelum> seriously? I tried building a pugs deb, but the debian/ directory wasn't working

[01:05] * Caelum just built a 0.4.8 parrot

[01:06] <moritz> Caelum: could you please post me an error message

[01:06] <moritz> with pastebot or mail to [email@hidden.address]
[01:06] * Caelum will do

[01:07] <moritz> Caelum: if you remove 'parrot' from the embed-line in debian/rules it should build fine

[01:07] <moritz> Caelum: does a "normal" 'make' or 'make soon' work for you?

[01:07] * Caelum hasn't tried in like a month

[01:08] <moritz> I fixed some minor issues the other day... for example a non-working patch

[01:08] <Caelum> err, parrot is 0.4.9 now... seems to build OK with the debian patch

[01:08] <Caelum> ahh yeah, I remember that

[01:09] <moritz> anyway, pugs builds will be at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/debian/pugs/ as soon as my damned slow upload is finished ;)

[01:09] <Caelum> cool! :)

[01:13] * Juerd is skimming over 400 p6l messages

[01:13] * Juerd missed a lot of cool stuff

[01:13] <jql> a zillion synopsis spawn[ed||ing] discussions

[01:16] *** fglock left
[01:17] * Caelum avoids building parrot with 5.9.5

[02:33] * Caelum 's debian-fu is very rusty

[02:38] <wolverian> I'm sure debian would like 'em? :)

[02:39] * Caelum is not a dev anymore...can't do an NMU

[02:40] *** ashleyb joined
[02:56] <mugwump> Caelum: share your debian/ files?

[03:04] <Caelum> crap, can't put anything on my shell, scp doesn't work...

[03:06] <Caelum> mugwump: I did an apt-get source parrot to get the latest diff, apply to svn tree, edit debian/rules to change $(MAKE) install to $(MAKE) reallyinstall, run dch to up the changelog and make sure it says 0.4.9 in the debian/ directory, also rm debian/control and fakeroot debian/rules debian/control before doing the build, that should be it

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine - some progress.

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | Regexp_Module.pm - Bugfixes and refactoring.

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | Fixed one _very_ long standing "thinko" bug with repetition.  It dated back to the original regex engine spike a year ago.  So there are many variants of it scattered around Common. :(

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | PerlMix.pm - created.  Non-working first draft of a dsl base/prototype class.

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | LangPugsRegexTests.pm - created.  Non-working first draft of a dsl using PerlMix.  It is intended to parse the small p6 dialect used in pugs t/regex/ test files, so the pugs regex testsuite can be run directly from p5.

[04:01] <svnbot6> r15355 | putter++ | OPP.pl - moved elsewhere, as the new opp in Perl-6.0.0-STD.pm should be explored instead.

[04:02] <putter> For the curious/puzzled, yet_another_regex_engine has had a mission creep metastasis.

[04:08] <putter> It looks like it might be possible to architect things so that creating your own p6 variant is as simple as creating a new p5 package, and mix-n-matching from grammars and grammar fragments, regex implementations, compilers, and runtimes.  We'll see.  It should at least be possible to reach out and use the pugs t/regex/ suite (much of it written in a very simple p6 dialect).

[04:10] <putter> Also a framework for creating a fully spec p6 regex engine.  Including dynamic modification games.

[04:13] <jql> so then 'use 6' will be a pragma importing the perl6 "defaults" for all those options?

[04:14] *** mako132 joined
[04:19] <Ziggy6> putter: do you intend to include grammar/rule support in yet_another_regex_engine?

[04:22] <putter> Ziggy6: oh yeah.  75% of the parrot rule tests are passing, though that's not saying much.  Lots of stuff is still missing.  I got distracted by mission creep.

[04:22] <svnbot6> r15356 | putter++ | yet_another_regex_engine/Regexp_ModuleA.pm - filename correction.

[04:22] <svnbot6> r15356 | putter++ | Regexp_ModuleA.pm was misnamed Regexp_Module.pm in svn.  For the entire month of its existence.

[04:22] <svnbot6> r15356 | putter++ | I gather no one tried running  prove t/re_tests.t or prove t/rx.t.  Ever.  That's just depressing.

[04:23] *** jisom joined
[04:24] <putter> jql: there is a first-draftish variation on v6.pm in Common/ .  basically it allows user and code to control which module gets to handle a  'use v6-alpha;'  declaration.

[04:24] *** jisom left
[04:24] *** jisom joined
[04:27] <putter> jql: under p5,  "use v6-alpha;" loads a module v6.pm.  The current v6.pm is perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6/lib/v6.pm, and is hardwired to Pugs-Compiler-Perl6.

[04:28] <putter> the hack draft new v6.pm defaults to Pugs-Compiler-Perl6, but will happily hand off to a different module if requested.

[04:30] <putter> the LangPugsRegexTests.pm hack is envisioned running as   $ pwd => pugs  $ PERL5_V6_IMPLEMENTATION=LangPugsRegexTests prove t/regex/...

[04:31] <putter> the environment variable requests v6.pm to hand off to the LangPugsRegexTests module which pretends to understand the small dialect of p6 used in pugs's t/regex/ test files.

[04:32] <putter> (current state is a non-working first draft based on a single test file.  <-- expectation management:)

[04:32] *** amnesiac joined
[04:34] <putter> The p5 and p6 engines are build as an  m-expression (ie, foo(bar(hee),qux)) grammar spec (rather than directly using rules), which creates an ast, from which some backend components are assembled.

[04:35] <putter> The objective for the m-expr based grammars is to get "high passes" on the test suites, thus exercising the backend.

[04:37] <putter> Then, next to LangPugsRegexTests, the other thing I'd like to see so I can hand off this exercise is a "Regex2.pm", which uses real  regex foo {} statements.  Initially based on the m-expr grammars, and then maturing from there.

[04:39] <putter> Oh, well, the third Lang I'd like to see is of course an attempt to implement Perl-6.0.0-STD.pm.

[04:39] <putter> Or more than one. :)

[04:43] <putter> Regexp_ModuleA's current code state is very highly crufty, with a lot of refactoring churn.  My hope is shortly after PerlMix starts working (not tonight;), it can serve as a stable base for folks to start playing.

[04:47] <putter> Ziggy6: to see what's currently working, you can just $ perl -w Regexp_ModuleA.pm --repl6   or run one of the testsuites as described at the top of README.

[04:47] <tene> PerlMix?

[04:51] <putter> sigh.  have to rename it.  perhaps refactor.  it is a module which can both be used as a language (use PerlMix;) and as a baseclass for your own language implementations.  use PerlMix; source filters your file, handing it to a compile method.  PerMix's compile method uses a grammar (which is just another method, and thus also overridable).  the

[04:52] <putter> default grammar understands p5 lines, regex decls, and a "BEGIN"-ish construct whose contents get eval()ed during the regex run.

[04:52] <putter> that's the rough plan anyway.

[04:54] <putter> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex_engine/LangPugsRegexTests.pm  shows how it is currently envisioned being used.  LPRT both uses it as a language (its written in PerlMix), and as its baseclass (it is intended to be used with the v6.pm hook).

[04:54] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/ytosh5

[04:54] <putter> But all this is a late evening's hackery, and so subject to radical change.  I was hoping to have it working this weekend, but oh well.

[04:56] <putter> The .t file it was drafted against was http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/regex/from_perl6_rules/anchors.t

[04:58] <putter> but the nice thing is that if the dialect of p6 used in t/regex/ looks to diverse (ie, ok() used with too many needless syntactic variations), the tests themselves can be cleaned up (which should probably happen anyway).

[04:58] <putter> s/to diverse/too diverse/

[04:59] <putter> tene: PerlMix because it implements a mix of p5 and whatever, with the notable whatever being bits of p6.  thus PerlMix.

[05:00] <putter> sooo going to change.

[05:01] <putter> any last questions, comments, odd body noises?

[05:01] <putter> just about end of day for mee

[10:03] <lichtkind> i can also but help is always appreciated

[10:04] <tene> there's examples/cookbook/ , but that's not quite a tutorial, and needs a lot of filling out, I think.

[10:06] <lichtkind> i know

[10:07] <lichtkind> i have the trunk here

[10:14] <tene> I have no standing at all.

[10:14] <lichtkind> moritz yes trunk version will be pod i think

[10:15] <lichtkind> tene so just interested?

[10:15] <tene> I touched up Net::IRC::OO, fixed a bug in Net::IRC, and commited a test for pugs crashing hard on eval()'ing some strange yaml

[10:16] <tene> I've answered a few questions on this channel.

[10:16] <tene> Pretty mundane. :)

[10:17] <lichtkind> tene but more than i did, in perl6 terms im what audrey calls english hacker :)

[10:17] <moritz> tene: then perhaps we both have the same level of ignorance ;)

[10:18] <tene> I stay pretty up-to-date on events in p6-land, I just don't have my mind together enough lately to do anything here.

[13:15] <fglock> I'm back to the net after 1 month :)

[13:17] <dmq> how bad where the withdrawal symptoms?

[13:18] <Ziggy6> hello fglock :)

[13:18] <fglock> dmq: I missed the immediate feedback

[13:19] <fglock> Ziggy6: hi!

[13:19] <Ziggy6> i've got dozens of questions, trying to prioritize them :)

[13:20] <fglock> I worked a bit on a C backend for kp6

[13:20] <Ziggy6> i saw that

[13:20] <Ziggy6> but

[13:20] <lichtkind> dmq hi man

[13:20] <Ziggy6> my question is: what's the motivation behind a C backend, isn't that what Parrot does?

[13:22] <fglock> the performance is good enough that some things can be written in p6, instead of C

[13:22] <fglock> like the GC, for example

[13:22] <Ziggy6> so you're unhappy with perl5's backend performance

[13:23] <SamB> I don't see how you can write a GC in a managed language...

[13:24] *** nipotan is now known as nipotaway

[13:24] <fglock> Ziggy6: I started coding Code.pm, and I noticed I was going too low level on it - so I thought about trying it in C

[13:25] <Ziggy6> could we use C++ for this backend? :D

[13:25] <moritz> no

[13:25] <Ziggy6> why not?

[13:25] <fglock> SamB: it would still use some low level C, but some high level decisions can be made in p6. It was just an example, anyway

[13:25] <Ziggy6> moritz: do you hate C++?

[13:26] <moritz> Ziggy6: no; read http://www.parrotcode.org/faq/

[13:26] <lambdabot> Title: Parrot FAQ - parrotcode:

[13:26] <fglock> Ziggy6: the reason to use C was because I needed to write the object system anyway, so C++ was not really necessary

[13:28] <fglock> I'm not against C++ or Parrot :)

[13:28] *** rhizo joined
[13:28] <Ziggy6> fglock: C++ would speed the development a bit, you could for example use stl map instead of handcoded hashes

[13:29] <lichtkind> juerd are you there?

[13:29] <Ziggy6> then perhaps i could rewrite your existing backend in C++ but i don't see how you will interface kp6 with it

[13:29] <fglock> Ziggy6: the plan is actually to have several hash implementations, depending on usage pattern

[13:30] <fglock> for performance tuning

[13:30] <Juerd> lichtkind: Yes, and will be for the next 2 minutes.

[13:30] <Ziggy6> my initial impresion was the hash_key and the method name are redundant

[13:30] <fglock> that's what parrot does, too

[13:30] *** rodi joined
[13:30] <fglock> hash_key is about 3x faster

[13:31] <fglock> for method dispatch

[13:31] *** rashakil joined
[13:31] <Ziggy6> but neither scales well :D

[13:32] <fglock> no, but it works well for small classes - which good enough for Str, Int

[13:32] <fglock> user-defined classes would use plain hashes

[13:33] *** the_dormant joined
[13:33] <fglock> it would be nice to try out a C++ version

[13:33] <Juerd> lichtkind: Gone now

[13:33] <Ziggy6> anyway, i guess i'm thinking too early about performance, being forced by the low-levelness of the language

[13:33] <Ziggy6> my main concern is how you are going to interface kp6 with the C backend

[13:36] <fglock> it needs an ast processor, that extracts closures into C "blessed subs", and an emitter

[13:36] <fglock> the C closure class was not written yet, but there exists a p5 prototype that can be translated

[13:37] <lichtkind> moritz are you there?

[13:38] <Ziggy6> so eval() won't be possible

[13:38] <moritz> lichtkind: pong ;)

[13:38] <kolibrie> fglock: welcome back

[13:38] *** IllvilJa joined
[13:39] <lichtkind> moritz shit i cants you send private msg

[13:40] <moritz> lichtkind: me not either...

[13:40] <moritz> lichtkind: you could join ircnet and /msg me there

[13:40] <lichtkind> url?

[13:41] <moritz> lichtkind: for example irc.uni-erlangen.de

[13:41] *** kanru joined
[13:42] <lichtkind> moritz fine conecting..

[13:42] <fglock> Ziggy6: I think eval is possible, if the code is represented as an object with s-expressions

[13:42] <fglock> interpreter-like

[13:44] <Ziggy6> it's too complicated and not very usefull I guess

[13:44] <Ziggy6> eval() is planned for kp6?

[15:07] *** forsaken joined
[15:07] <gaal> S::PM is inspired by another S::PM, which claims:

[15:07] <gaal> "Functional languages' compilers usually optimize away the pattern matching overhead of evaluating the conditions for every call until a matching condition is found. This is mostly possible because of their static typing system which Perl proudly lacks"

[15:08] <gaal> I don't see how this is generally true. function variants are desugared to case statements after all

[15:09] <gaal> -- http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/Sub-PatternMatching-1.04/lib/Sub/PatternMatching.pm

[15:09] <lambdabot> Title: Sub::PatternMatching - Functional languages' Pattern Matching for Perl subs - se ..., http://tinyurl.com/2esuo6

[15:10] <allbery_b> hm?  where exactly you  put the conditions isn't really significant.  using type information to optimize away the condition still works

[15:10] <gaal> since variant constructors are not available to the type system I'm not even sure if the compiler can inline a function case

[15:10] <gaal> consider f :: Maybe a -> ...

[15:11] <allbery_b> (since purity means you can move stuff like that around without changing the meaning)

[15:11] <gaal> f Nothing = ...

[15:11] <gaal> f Just x = ...

[15:11] <Grrrr> gaal: it was not "inspired", exactly;  the Sub-PatternMatching syntax is too horrid

[15:11] <gaal> now I have a consumer of f and a path that can only have a Just x value

[15:12] <gaal> sure, the compiler may be smart enough to figure that out and inline just the Just case of f into the consumer

[15:12] <gaal> but it's not like it's guaranteed to happen

[15:12] *** rfordinal_ joined
[15:12] <allbery_b> no, it's not guaranteed.  but FP / purity means it's easier for the compiler to find and optimize it

[15:13] <gaal> I agree; but this is not part of the static type system

[15:13] <allbery_b> (both the guarantees of the type system, and the fact that a pure expression can be moved around with fewer worries)

[15:13] <allbery_b> yeh, as I said, it's more closely related to purity

[15:14] <allbery_b> but I think the static typing thing is more getting at that in e.g. perl you can't even be certain at runtime that you have a Maybe a

[15:14] <allbery_b> (at least, nowhgere nnear as easily as when the type system guarantees it)

[15:14] <gaal> and sure, that you *don't* have IO a :-)

[15:15] <allbery_b> given both constraints (strong typing and purity) the compiler has a much easier job of inlining just the part that applies

[15:16] <allbery_b> I'm willing to be lenient on iti because many people even who know FP don't quie have straight how the various aspects of it interact, and think of the strong typing instead of other aspects like purity

[15:16] <gaal> I'm not saying FP compilers aren't better off when it comes to these optimization techniques. Of course they are :) Just that the comment in that doc is perhaps a little misleading

[15:17] <gaal> that paragraph I quoted continues: "Therefore, using this module for pattern matching currently takes an O(n) performance hit for every call to the patternmatching function. n is the number of branches, sets of conditions."

[15:17] <gaal> this suggests that FP magically gets you better than O(n)

[15:17] <gaal> when in fact there's no such promise

[15:18] <allbery_b> yeh

[15:18] <gaal> that's all I'm claiming.

[15:19] <gaal> (FWIW: how many programmers know how to tell whether a function variant was inlined?)

[17:50] <dmq> juerd.

[17:50] <dmq> heh.

[17:51] <dmq> not sure if there is room in my brain to be competent in both.

[17:51] <audreyt> well with luck I hope it'll be the same engine eventually :)

[17:51] <dmq> but im sure at some point ill take a look.

[17:51] <moritz> I didn't even knew that you can parse xml with regexes

[17:52] <audreyt> a regex that parses xml is very ex, and very not reg, indeed

[17:52] <dmq> last time i checked it was in parrot bytecode tho, which was a little offputting.

[17:52] <moritz> ok ;)

[17:52] <audreyt> dmq: there's a couple implementation in perl 5

[17:53] <audreyt> dmq: one is in pugs/misc/pX/Common/yet_another_regex engine, another is on CPAN as Pugs::Compiler::Rule (and also pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule)

[17:53] <dmq> well there you go, then i am helping. :-)

[17:53] *** thepler joined
[17:54] <dmq> thing was part of the motivation for doing the stuff i have been was to improve my C skills.

[17:54] <audreyt> one way you can help is helping avar getting ::Plugin working :)

[17:54] <dmq> so doing stuff in either Perl or PBC sort of misses the point.

[17:54] <dmq> ive been doing my best.

[17:55] <audreyt> ideally, we'd like a roundtripped-to-userland-and-back ::Plugin to pass all re tests in perl5 regression tests

[17:55] <dmq> we broke re:engine::PCRE in order to make ::Plugin easier to do

[17:55] <dmq> sure.

[17:55] <audreyt> should it Just Work, or (as far as you know) there's known problems?

[17:56] <dmq> it being what?

[17:56] <dmq> ::Plugin?

[17:56] <audreyt> having a ::Plugin that simply, in its comp hook

[17:56] <audreyt> construct a qr// and save to stash

[17:56] <audreyt> and in its exec hook

[17:56] <rindolf> Hi audreyt 

[17:56] <audreyt> simply retrieve the stash and match

[17:56] <rindolf> audreyt: what's up? How are you feeling?

[17:56] *** GabrielVieira2 is now known as GabrielVieira

[17:57] <audreyt> rindolf: feeling okay. about to sleep. will get $real_laptop back tomorrow

[17:57] <dmq> well i think it should work.

[17:57] <rindolf> audreyt: good.

[17:57] <dmq> there are structural flaws that are yet to be resolved.

[17:57] <rindolf> audreyt: what's your $fake_laptop?

[17:58] <dmq> when qr// was introduced I dont think anybody realized how it might interact with (??{..}).

[17:58] <dmq> Actually, when qr// was introduced I dont think the full ramifications of it were completely understood.

[17:58] *** xinming joined
[17:58] <dmq> So there are some serious issues with potential corruption because of the way we store match results.

[17:59] <audreyt> would it be better if we simply stash the textual regex/flags

[17:59] <dmq> there is also still a lot of global state...

[17:59] <audreyt> and recompile during exec()?

[17:59] <audreyt> s/better/less flaky/

[17:59] <dmq> no not necessarily.

[17:59] <audreyt> rindolf: a random asus M2C with WinXP

[17:59] <dmq> the issues are deeper than that. its mostly an issue of tuits, and perhaps funding, to resolve it.

[18:00] <gaal> remoose

[18:00] <dmq> im starting to apply for work so ill have dramatically less time to hack the engine.

[18:01] <dmq> although rgs has been encouraging me to apply for a grant, which i will do if i can come up with a design that has a decent chance of solving the deeper issues.

[18:01] *** Daveman joined
[18:01] <dmq> one note to p6 implementors, putting match results in the regexp object is not a good plan.

[18:01] <audreyt> uh. and perl5 does that?

[18:01] <audreyt> <- blissfully ignorant

[18:02] <Juerd> dmq: Neat!

[18:02] <Juerd> dmq++

[18:02] <dmq> i can totally see how it made sense before qr// but once you have a qr// type construct its not cool.

[18:02] <Juerd> dmq++

[18:02] <Juerd> But I have to go now (fucking server broke down, have to build one out of used spare parts)

[18:02] <dmq> juerd, i make no promises that try() will work, and i think you should replace the \xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF with (*FAIL).

[18:03] <rindolf> audreyt: ouch!

[18:03] <Juerd> Already have

[18:03] <dmq> cool.

[18:03] <dmq> actually if you dont mind i wouldnt mind seeing the generator script.

[18:03] <Juerd> You're actually using a rather old version, because the latest doesn't exhibit the bug ;)

[18:03] <dmq> id like to torture it somewhat to see if i can get the buffer overrun to happen again

[18:03] <Juerd> I worked around the A-B problems by hardcoding them

[18:04] <dmq> yes, thats something you should mention to larry. its a really weird requirement that maybe he should know about.

[18:04] <dmq> er, timtoady i mean.

[18:04] * dmq not having been introduced properly yet

[18:04] <Juerd> dmq: http://tnx.nl/6058YAIV

[18:04] <lambdabot> Title: TNX

[18:05] <dmq> audreyt: yes p5 does that.

[18:05] <Juerd> dmq: It's two requirements. The w3 people themselves don't use it consistently. This grammar can /never/ be automatically converted.

[18:05] <specbot6> r13704 | larry++ | Made one-pass parsing rule explicit so that tests can refer to it.

[18:05] <Juerd> And I think Perl 6 already does A-B

[18:05] <dmq> match data is stored in the same structure as the compiled pattern. presumably for efficiency sake, which made sense before qr//

[18:05] <Juerd> [ A && <! B > ], iirc

[18:05] <dmq> juerd: for classes yes. but for non classes?

[18:06] <Juerd> Perhaps <!before B>

[18:06] <Juerd> Assuming the RHS of && is limited to whatever A matched.

[18:06] <svnbot6> r15367 | lwall++ | Add test of one-pass parsing of regex character classes.

[18:06] <dmq> but it has to be bounded

[18:06] <Juerd> I think it'll have to be, for && to make sense at all

[18:07] <Juerd> though "barfoo" ~~ /foo && bar/ being true also makes some kind of sense

[18:08] <gaal> whatdefines removeCRLF?

[18:08] <gaal> and how come it works when mentioned before decoding?

[18:08] <gaal> *called

[18:08] <audreyt> gaal: removeCRLF is defined just below

[18:08] <audreyt> why not?

[18:09] <gaal> oh, local func. last place I looked<tm>

[18:09] <gaal> because, what encoding is the \n?

[18:09] <gaal> previously there was

[18:10] <gaal> removeCRLF $ decode

[18:10] <gaal> now there's decode $ removeCRLF

[18:13] <gaal> also, is decodeUTF8 really inlined where it's used?

[18:14] <audreyt> sure it is

[18:14] <audreyt> it's got INLINE

[18:15] <TimToady> I think && should have the same semantics as & except for the sequence point.

[18:15] <TimToady> meaning / foo && <!before bar> / can never match

[18:15] <TimToady> would have to be written /foo && <!before bar> .* /

[18:16] <TimToady> to make it end the same place.

[18:16] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[18:17] <svnbot6> r15368 | audreyt++ | * gaal++ pointed that for all non-UTF8 unicode encodings

[18:17] <svnbot6> r15368 | audreyt++ |   we need to removeCRLF _after_ the decoding, not _before_.

[18:17] <svnbot6> r15368 | audreyt++ |   (for UTF8 it's the same thing, so we preserve better chunkiness.)

[18:17] *** dec_ joined
[18:18] <audreyt> gaal: re really-inlined, note that GHC has cross-module inlining

[18:18] <PerlJam> TimToady: / foo && .{3} / matches, correct?  Is there a way to get an unbounded quantifier to do the same?  / foo && .*  /   (It seems like it could do so eventually via backtracking)

[18:18] <gaal> oh, for some reason I misremembered the pragma as "a nudge", like inline in C/C++ more or less, not the sledgehammer the userdoc seciton I just reread says

[18:18] <audreyt> i.e. it saves the Core AST for all inlinable things, and INLINE forces that, and it does inline the AST when linking

[18:18] <audreyt> *importing

[18:18] <TimToady> both of those match, but yes, the .* version might take longer unless it's in the DFA area

[18:19] <TimToady> and by definition the right side of && is outside the DFA area

[18:19] <PerlJam> ah, okay

[18:19] <TimToady> & can build dfa of both sides, presumably

[18:26] <lambdabot> Title: #perl6 2007-02-19,Mon, http://tinyurl.com/2cbrpr

[18:26] <dmq> timtoady: the problem juerd was dealing with was this nasty w3 construct PATA-PATB where PATA must match, but PATB maynot, but only in the part that PATA matched.

[18:26] <TimToady> I think && handles that naturally if you assume same length semantics

[18:27] <PerlJam> rindolf: Can you verify that TimToady is indeed Larry Wall?  ;-)

[18:27] <dmq> for instance they had something like ([class]+) - '-'

[18:28] <rindolf> PerlJam: I have verified his 2048-bit PKE using state-of-the-art and cutting-edge biometric identification system.

[18:28] <dmq> im doubtful i properly grok &&, all i know is i couldnt think of a sane way to do it in p5 regex.

[18:28] <TimToady> so you want something like <[class]>+ & <!before -> .*

[18:28] <audreyt> fglock: hey. no need to be sorry at all.

[18:29] <TimToady> or <[class]>+ & <!before .* -> .*

[18:29] <dmq> i guess so, except it has to work as part of a larger pattern, so you could have / X (Y+ - Z)/

[18:29] <PerlJam> -> naturally chunks together all too well

[18:29] <audreyt> fglock: we cleared that up with chromatic long ago, and it's all fine now :)

[18:30] <TimToady> or <[class]>+ & [<!before -> .]*

[18:30] <dmq> .... where X might match Z

[18:30] *** IllvilJa joined
[18:30] <TimToady> or <[class]>+ & <-[-]>*

[18:31] <dmq> but would that work if X matched Z?

[18:31] <TimToady> PerlJam: yea, -> should probably be spaced

[18:32] <dmq> for the '-' example they were just being stupid. but there was another one that was more complex.

[18:32] <TimToady> dmq: why wouldn't it work?

[18:33] *** shlomif joined
[18:33] <TimToady> the point of & is that it constrains both sides against the same substring, which is exactly what you want.

[18:33] <TimToady> so X has nothing to do with it

[18:34] <dmq> ah ok, i didnt get that part. i did say i didnt grok the &&.

[18:34] <dmq> cool, glad you have it sorted. :-)

[18:35] <dmq> fyi: they were being lazy about writing <[class]-[-]> - <[class]-[-]>

[18:35] <dmq> if i remember the new charclass syntax properly.

[18:35] <dmq> er i mean <[class]-[-]>+ - <[class]-[-]>+

[18:38] <TimToady> but that should just construct an anonymous class that is missing -

[18:38] <TimToady> shouldn't need &

[18:39] <dmq> they had a more complex example that probably needed the &.

[18:39] <TimToady> k

[18:39] <dmq> but i agree with that.

[18:39] <dmq> case

[18:39] <fglock> I wonder if it would be sane to link p5 to kp6-C, and reuse unicode/regex/memory management

[18:39] <dmq> anyway, nice chatting, gf is waiting for me to go to dinner.

[20:21] <fglock> Bool is an enum (afaik)

[20:21] <Juerd> $bit << 2 makes sense, $bool << 2 does not.

[20:21] <[particle]> can a Bool be undef?

[20:21] <[particle]> it seems a Bit can

[20:21] <Juerd> [particle]: IIRC, all ucfirst can.

[20:21] *** lichtkind joined
[20:22] <fglock> a Bit container can be undef, but a Bit cannot

[20:23] <[particle]> i guess that's the container, then

[20:23] <[particle]> it's in section "Immutable types"

[20:25] <[particle]> i've got to wonder what the difference between 'bit' and 'bool' is, then (native types)

[20:27] <fglock> bool doesn't promise to be 1-bit (afaik)

[20:28] <[particle]> darned two-bit booleans!

[20:29] <allbery_b> that sounds like a dailywtf

[20:30] <allbery_b> bool = true | false | maybe | somethingelse ...

[20:30] <avar> [particle]: Implementation wise: none? It's there to implement object objecty-sugar I would guess

[20:30] <baest> more likely 32 or 64 bit booleans

[20:30] * [particle] is considering the state of parrot's native type support wrt perl 6 types

[20:31] <[particle]> our boolean array uses bits, but a boolean uses a byte

[20:31] <baest> i think several implentations mapped defined a bool as an int. At least i remeber something like that

[20:31] <[particle]> so, an array of 32 booleans is the same size as one

[20:32] <avar> bit/bool would be a PMC wrapping an int that knew whether it was Int::1 or Bool::True ?

[20:32] <avar> no idea though:)

[20:32] <[particle]> i imagine the hll 'Bool::True' is dealt with by the parser

[20:33] <[particle]> no, maybe that info is carried into the ast

[20:34] <[particle]> anyway, it's likely optimized out before vm opcodes are generated

[20:34] <[particle]> so, unless there are semantic differences between bit and bool, they'll be implemented the same way, which is by a parrot IREG

[20:35] <[particle]> however, we'll have to fudge uint, since parrot only has signed integers natively

[22:30] * eric256 tries googling using "set" agian and waits for the huge number of misleading hits

[22:30] <TimToady> ?eval say list(1..10) < 6

[22:30] <evalbot_r15368> OUTPUT[12345‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:31] <eric256> i wonder if we could autogenerate an index to the docs

[22:31] <TimToady> (except it's currently each() that is specced to do that)

[22:31] <eric256> list?

[22:31] <Limbic_Region> eric256 - the original thread was "Malfunction Junction, what's your function?" 2005-04-28

[22:31] <TimToady> look for Set and KeySet

[22:31] <eric256> ?eval say list(1,2,3,4) > list(2,3);

[22:31] <evalbot_r15368> OUTPUT[34‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:32] <Limbic_Region> eric256 - the follow up (from me anyway) was "Do junctions support the intersection of lists" 2006-04-06

[22:32] <eric256> wow...didn't even know 'list' existed....thanks L~R i think i remember that from the first time around.. yea that followup was what i found

[22:32] <eric256> thanks timtoady

[22:32] <TimToady> you only get one list though

[22:33] <TimToady> your eval was doing >2

[22:33] <TimToady> and like I said, it was recently changed to each(), but pugs hasn't caught up with that yet.

[22:35] <eric256> pugs or the docs apparently...where would i be looking to see discriptions of list or each?

[22:35] <tene> ?eval list(1..10) % 2 == 0

[22:35] <evalbot_r15368> Bool::True

[22:35] <eric256> S02 talkes about KeySet but only in a vague no idea how you'd use it type way ;)

[22:36] <eric256> ?eval say list(list(1,2,3,4) > 2) > 3

[22:36] <evalbot_r15368> OUTPUT[4‚ê§] Bool::True

[22:37] <TimToady> list() > 3 was an early attempt at easy list comprehensions.

[22:37] <TimToady> it's just syntactic sugar for a grep.

[22:37] <TimToady> we might not keep it, now that we have more general list comprehensions.

[22:38] <eric256> yea but its tasty ;)

[22:38] *** devogon joined
[22:38] <TimToady> grep for 'comprehension' for the more general forms

[22:38] <eric256> @results = any(@values) ~~ all(@rules); would be cool.

[22:38] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[22:39] <eric256> S02 for those reading along at home ;)

[22:40] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[22:41] *** gnuvince_ joined
[22:41] <eric256> is there any pod syntax to specify something that should be indexed?  so that when you put a definition of each you could somehow flag it to show up in an index?  my problem is mostly that i don't know where to look and often i dont' know what it is called now.  so an index to scan could be quite helpfull

[22:41] <TimToady> for example: @results = ($_ when all(@rules)) for @values

[22:42] <TimToady> people sometimes use X<> for that.

[22:43] *** explorer joined
[22:43] <TimToady> but if we keep the list/each shortcut it's just @results = each(@values) ~~ all(@rules)

[22:43] <eric256> ahh thats pretty darn close to what i was looking for. thanks

[22:44] <tene> and what is @rules a list of?

[22:44] <eric256> match objects i would expect

[22:45] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ all(/3/,/7/)

[22:45] <evalbot_r15368> (no output)

[22:45] *** Caelum joined
[22:45] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ all(/7/)

[22:45] <evalbot_r15368> (no output)

[22:45] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ /7/

[22:45] <evalbot_r15368> [7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 87, 97]

[22:45] <TimToady> looks like all() not auththreading right

[22:45] <eric256> doesn't look like its playing nice yet

[22:46] <TimToady> *auto

[22:46] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ (/7/ | /3/)

[22:46] <evalbot_r15368> (no output)

[22:46] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ (7 | 3)

[22:46] <evalbot_r15368> [3, 7]

[22:47] <TimToady> looks like patterns aren't autothreading

[22:47] <TimToady> ?eval @results = list(1..100) ~~ ({ $_ % 7 } | { $_ % 3} )

[22:47] <moritz> so does ~~ substitute p5s grep?

[22:47] <evalbot_r15368> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]

[22:48] <moritz> (among other things of course )

[22:48] <eric256> not grep, regex...now its SmartMatch

[22:48] <moritz> ok, p6 still has grep

[22:50] <TimToady> whoops, misplaced a paren

[22:50] *** stevan_ joined
[22:51] <TimToady> it's @results = ($_ when all(@rules) for @values)

[22:51] <TimToady> basically, I recently relaxed the nested modifiers restriction to allow an if-ish one inside a loop-ish one.

[22:52] <TimToady> plus treating the inside of (...) like a statement

[22:53] *** explorer joined
[22:53] <dmq> if i wanted to use perl6 to support interval notation the unbalanced parens wouldnt necessarily be an issue would it?

[22:54] <TimToady> not to perl 6

[22:54] <dmq> stupid question i guess just something that occured to me.

[22:54] <TimToady> it'll drive any syntax highlighter completely bonkers though.

[22:54] <dmq> heh

[22:54] <dmq> s/perl\K6/ 6/

[22:54] <dmq> :-)

[22:55] <TimToady> you'd just have a term token that doesn't require its opener to match its closer

[22:55] <dmq> cool.

[22:57] <TimToady> I suspect we'll already get a certain amount of heartburn from the fact that <( doesn't have to match )> in P6 regex.

[22:58] <TimToady> which maybe means we should have used something other than parens in that token.

[22:59] *** Macae left
[22:59] <TimToady> but that's probably on a level that a syntax highlighter can deal with, assuming it can have a regex mode.

[23:00] <TimToady> the worse problem is that parsing something like (1,100] would require an awful lookahead to distinguish it from ordinary parens.

[23:01] <TimToady> that's why I went with 1^..100 instead

[23:04] <offby1> nice to know you're keeping syntax highlighting in mind -- my big fear is that there'll never be a decent Emacs mode for perl6

[23:07] <eric256> is there a way to define custom operators that would have values inside the operator?    such as (1,100] were presumably the operator is (,] with two values imbeded in it?

[23:07] <TimToady> what I'm hoping is that the grammar will be such that we can ask a grammar to spit out a highlighter for an editor, even if you're in some custom language.

[23:07] <TimToady> yes, but you have to have sufficient clue to know when to switch into a sublanguage

[23:08] <TimToady> and for (1,100] that involves lookahead to the ], probably

[23:08] *** demq joined
[23:08] <TimToady> mathematicians are great at coming up with syntax that looks good to a human but drives computers crazy

[23:09] <TimToady> but that's essentially the process that happens when you switch into a sublanguage such as inside rx//

[23:09] <TimToady> where < means something entirely different than outside

[23:09] <TimToady> now if you had a token that was "interval (,100]" you wouldn't need the lookahead.

[23:09] <TimToady> you'd just need the sublanguage

[23:11] <moritz> mathematicians are weird anyway ;)

[23:12] <TimToady> most people waste single matching bracket pairs at a time.  leave it to the mathematicians to figure out how to waste both parens and square brackets at the same time...

[23:12] *** polettix joined
[23:13] <offby1> they have an infinite supply, so they're not really wasting them ... 

[23:13] <offby1> or at least until their pencil lead runs out.

[23:13] <TimToady> there's always chalk...

[23:14] <TimToady> interesting that chalk comes from southern England, and graphite from northern England.  that could explain a lot.

[23:14] * eric256 drools over his liquid graphit pencil some before returning to work

[23:15] * offby1 never noticed fights between the chalk-fanciers and the pencil-fanciers in school, but then he dropped out

[23:16] <TimToady> well, of course "offby1" wouldn't grok (pencil,chalk]   :)

[23:17] <offby1> it'd probably be (pencil, chalk) or even [pencil, chalk] -- I'm not above being off by 2

[23:17] <moritz> chalk and blackboar where the first primitive wikis ;)

[23:17] <TimToady> nah, cave wall and charcoal, I think

[23:18] <TimToady> Booga, booga!  Wiki wiki!

[23:18] <moritz> TimToady: but cave walls aren't that easiy whipped clean

[23:18] <moritz> s/whipped/wiped/ ;)

[23:18] <TimToady> and how often do you wipe clean your wiki?

[23:18] <eric256> yea once you've drawn on them with your enemies blood its all down hill from there

[23:18] <moritz> sometimes english is harder than perl ;)

[23:19] <TimToady> hmm, what if half the cave paintings were actually spam...

[23:19] * offby1 jerks awake

[23:19] <offby1> whipped cream?  Where?

[23:20] <moritz> TimToady: what did they sell? buffalos?

[23:20] *** IllvilJa left
[23:20] <moritz> TimToady: or "extra sharp stone blades"? porn?

[23:22] <TimToady> buffalos?  perhaps, under the category "bogus stock"

[23:39] <masak> does pre- and postincrement return an rvalue? why?
