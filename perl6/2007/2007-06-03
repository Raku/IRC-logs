[06:01] *** dragonheart left
[06:02] <lumi> If it's possible to cut envEval out of env

[06:04] <lumi> Do you know why it is in Env?

[06:05] <gaal> the envoronment closes on an evaluator function

[06:07] <gaal> there's only one place where this is modified though, in evaluate itself where it's rewired to evaluate'

[06:07] <gaal> I don't understand that very well

[06:08] <gaal> like, you only _don't_ replace the evaluator when you have a debug thing set up

[06:08] <gaal> this sounds slow if it's recursive

[06:09] <lumi> Yeah, iswym, it seems wonky

[06:09] <gaal> ah actually it isn't; because you rewire the evaluator with local and from then on you don't worry abou tit

[06:09] <gaal> brb coffee

[06:11] <lumi> Would you ever need the envCaller's envEval? I'm still not seeing what it's up to

[06:20] <gaal> I don't think so

[06:21] <lumi> In that case, it can probably be cut out of there

[06:21] <lumi> It should be possible (but not necessarily a good idea) to have it in a seperate ReaderT

[06:23] <gaal> audreyt had a trick to tease apart circularity with newtypes, but I can't remember what it was

[06:23] <lumi> Got any leads?

[06:23] <gaal> early pugs.val revisions

[06:23] <lumi> If it doesn't actually belong in the frame, it probably *should* be removed

[06:24] <gaal> there are only three concrete evaluators present

[06:24] <gaal> the debugging one, the const (return VUndef) one, and the real one

[06:25] <gaal> gotta get back to work though

[06:25] *** Averell joined
[06:25] <lumi> So maybe it can be replaced with a small sh^W data type (DebugEval|FakeEval|RealEval)

[06:26] <lumi> I need to go too

[06:26] <gaal> unless the colsure effect is important

[06:27] <gaal> moose, then.

[06:27] <lumi> If it's important, it's only in the Debug case, sec

[06:28] <lumi> It isn't, afaict

[06:28] <lumi> It's not closing over anything

[06:29] <lumi> Looks to me like it's just a trick to give up the debug evaluator as soon as possible

[06:30] <lumi> Haskell code is easy to reason about

[06:32] <gaal> so the problem is just with having the Eval type visible in Env.hs

[06:33] <gaal> or rather, the Env -> Eval Val type :)

[06:35] <lumi> What problem?

[06:35] <lumi> I think it can live in Pugs.AST now?

[06:36] *** devogon joined
[06:36] <lumi> I could be very wrong, but there's an evalExp there that just asks envEval and then uses it

[06:36] <lumi> Unless there's another circularity problem

[06:37] <gaal> what are you refering to that can live in Pugs.AST? my starting point is that I want to move over Env to a separate module

[06:37] <gaal> it's in P.A.Internals now

[06:39] <lumi> Why does (Env -> Eval Val) need to be visible in Pugs.*.Env?

[06:39] <gaal> er sorry, Exp -> Eval Val. That's the type of envEval

[06:40] <lumi> Right, but still

[06:40] <lumi> Why does it need to be visible in P.A.Env?

[06:40] <gaal> the alternative is to make envEval a datatype marking which to use, like you suggested

[06:40] <gaal> but that's a runtime hit every call to evaluate

[06:41] <gaal> um i want to put the Env type there, and it's a member...

[06:41] <lumi> I wonder what the newtype trickery is

[06:41] <gaal> svk log Pugs.Val then and moose around

[06:41] <gaal> as you can tell, I'm not here

[06:42] <lumi> I'll try to look later, I'm seriously ue to be gone

[06:42] <lumi> s/ue/due/

[19:29] <gaal> moose!

[19:29] <gaal> I ran into your name just a few days ago, putter

[19:30] <gaal> saw an ooooold comment you made on some website

[19:32] <mncharity> I'm scattered far and wide. :)  How goes?

[19:32] <gaal> not bad at all!

[19:34] <gaal> except perhaps for the oppressive heat. i'm trying to work up the concentration to revisit compilation cache, and resist aping my cat, who is incessantly napping. that would not do, I prefer cats to apes.

[19:34] <mncharity> lol

[19:35] <mncharity> I've been in python land lately.  Creates cravings for p6.

[19:35] <gaal> doesn't python has some metaclass stuff too?

[19:36] <mncharity> air conditioning?

[19:36] <gaal> I don't know very much python but I've a feeling I'm about to pick up some soon

[19:37] <gaal> only in the other room. actually the ambient temp isn't bad, it's this laptop that's frying me. I remember seeing some metal frame thingie that was supposed to support laptops in many positions (incl. the audrety one, I think). but I can't find it now

[19:40] <mncharity> re py metaclass stuff, indeed.  and there are some sub-communities which believe in dsl's.  but it's far from say ruby's cultural embrace.  lots of java-like 'the language is the language and why would you use anything else?  that would just cause confusion'.

[19:42] <gaal> nod

[19:43] * mncharity pictures tube made of garbage bags used to feed cold air to a minicomputer, being moved from one room to another, while continuing to do orbital calcs for a satellite. :)

[19:44] <mncharity> (whenever someone has cooling issues, I think, well, you take some garbage bags and duct tape, and....)

[19:45] <gaal> lol

[19:47] <Tene> I have a friend who did something like that...

[19:56] <gaal> also interesting cooling system :)

[19:57] <mncharity> vinge had a sf story where people could teleport swap bits of matter with places they had been to.  so you might visit a cool mountain so you could later provide air conditioning services.

[19:57] <gaal> I think Larry Niven had a vignette about Maxwell's demon

[19:58] <allbery_b> one of his "unfinished stories"

[19:58] <gaal> this guy was living in a cave, and his demon was keeping out all the molecules moving too quickly

[19:58] <allbery_b> it was the Warlock :)

[19:58] <gaal> ah :)
