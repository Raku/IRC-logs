[05:51] <TimToady> dduncan: see both p5 and p6:

[05:51] <TimToady> ?eval 1 <=> 2

[05:51] <evalbot_r16845> -1

[05:52] <amnesiac> TimToady, p6 still supports to tell it what sorting algorithm to use for the sort call?

[05:52] <dduncan> so, my question was whether eg -1 corresponded to ::Increase or ::Decrease

[05:52] <TimToady> do you think going from 1 to 2 is an increase?

[05:53] <dduncan> I follow you now that this interpretation is given

[05:53] <TimToady> C's sort originally defined it in terms of subtraction, so <=> and friends have always returned -1 for increasing

[05:53] <dduncan> before I was interpreting the names as to be what to do if you were sorting the 2 values, what you do with the first one's position in a list

[05:54] <dduncan> so eg given 1 <=> 2, you would be decreasing the 1 relative to the 2 in the sorted list, if you move it at all

[05:54] <TimToady> I think most p6 sorts will not use <=> or cmp, but a 1-ary extractor

[05:55] <dduncan> that was my confusion ... I don't know if its worth updating the synopsis to clarify the intended interpretation of the names or not

[05:55] <dduncan> eg, "if you increase lhs, do you move towards rhs"

[05:56] <dduncan> or something like that

[05:57] <dduncan> question: might it be worth naming these ::Before and ::After instead, which could then parallel the &before and &after operators, if I remember their names correctly

[05:57] <TimToady> well, pugs should really be returning Order::Increasing much like it returns Bool::True

[05:57] <TimToady> and you shouldn't be concerned with the values of the enum

[05:58] <dduncan> I'm not concerned about the enum's values so much as that I was confused by the documentation, as it looked like 1 <=> would return increase when I thought it looked like it shoud return ::decrease

[05:58] *** Schwern joined
[05:58] <dduncan> er 1 <=> 2

[05:58] <dduncan> but still, I now understand your interpretation

[05:58] <TimToady> "as you move from left to right, the values are increasing"

[06:01] <dduncan> actually, as I think more, increase|decrease are better names for this than before|after, since they describe the 2 comparands together, and not just the first one

[06:01] <dduncan> maybe

[06:01] <Aankhen``> Uhzactly.

[06:03] <dduncan> separately ... maybe this has been discussed to death already, but does every type have a default ordering semantics, perhaps using their memory address, or would we get a fail when trying to sort 2 values that aren't of a normally ordinal type?

[06:03] <dduncan> eg, what should happen if you try to sort a list of Any ?

[06:04] <dduncan> fail or some non-important Object provided default?

[06:04] <dduncan> I mean the generic sort, not the string/num casting one

[06:04] <TimToady> cmp, not leg or <=>

[06:05] <TimToady> uses eqv semantics rather than ===, so based on canonicalization of some kind

[06:05] <TimToady> don't know what the default canonicalization for eqv is though

[06:06] <wolverian> list of Any? heresy! 

[06:06] <TimToady> certainly an arbitrary one can be imposed for types that don't support an explicit cmp operation

[06:06] <wolverian> (but old heresy, so it's okay)

[13:22] <Limbic_Region> fglock - there is absolutely no problem repainting the shed once it is built - it is when the walls themselves are made of various different colors of dried paint that you have to worry

[13:23] <moritz> ;-)

[13:59] <Limbic_Region> fglock - it counts if you say it does cause anyone else is too far removed from the problem to know if it is applicable or not

[14:04] <fglock> sigh

[15:00] <Limbic_Region> I didn't realize Linus was such a prick but after watching what he had to say about people that use subversion I am not impressed

[15:01] <args> did he use the word "nazi" ?

[15:01] <moritz> args: afaict not

[15:01] <zamolxes> 'mental institution', 'masturbation' , 'idiots' .. 

[15:02] <Limbic_Region> just a sec, I didn't watch all 70 minutes so it is a possibility

[15:02] <args> then he thinks that svn is still superior to gnome :)

[15:02] <moritz> is he a KDE fanboy?

[15:03] <wolverian> moritz, more than a gnome fanboy, certainly.. 

[15:03] <Limbic_Region> he says that anyone who disagrees with him is ugly and stupid

[15:05] <wolverian> and he says he knows he's a git :)

[15:10] <avar> Limbic_Region: You're misrepresenting him, it's quite obvious from the talk that he's half serious

[15:10] <avar> The issues he points out with cvs and subversion are valid

[15:12] <moritz> i think many tech people tend to be more honest than polite

[15:20] <diakopter> TimToady: perhaps Coke's request for 'trace add execution' could be handled with an override of ';'

[15:44] <avar> diakopter: why not overload the runloop?

[15:56] *** philv left
[15:57] <diakopter> avar: I don't know enough to understand that concept (much more than barely). I was looking for a way to do it at the parsing level, since for a trace, the developer usually cares about the statements they have made, not whatever the optimizer has turned their program into

[15:57] <diakopter> avar: although of course, they *should* care more about the optimizer's results....

[16:04] <Limbic_Region> avar - I am sorry, but if you thought it was obvious that he was in any way joking, I have to disagree with you.

[17:25] <TimToady> diakopter: certainly anything is possible at the compilation stage.  and we have to be careful about what we mandate at the run stage

[17:25] <TimToady> avar: there might not *be* a runloop in some implementations

[17:27] <avar> which is why it's probably best to solve this by altering your ast to call subs before and after rather than oveloarding a syntactic statement delimiter

[17:28] <TimToady> but it's still something the compiler is choosing, which is proper because it has performance ramifications

[17:28] <TimToady> you're just attaching it to the node that is often produced by ; instead :)

[17:30] <TimToady> now, what we *could* do is mandate that the compiler compile both the optimized and pessimized forms of output, and then pick one, but then you slow down the compiler a bit, or at least require the runtime to be able to re-emit with different characteristics

[17:31] <TimToady> the latter can actually get you compiled code that runs faster than C

[17:31] <TimToady> because if you can reemit, you can do so with the knowledge of which branches were taken historically

[17:32] <TimToady> of course, switching to a different compilation of the same code has issues

[17:32] <TimToady> which I think are mostly solved by saying that we don't try to switch in mid routine, but just pick an implementation at routine entry and go with it

[17:33] <TimToady> though in some ways you'd like finer granularity

[17:34] <TimToady> inserting "switch points" where things are sane is, alas, an *interesting* problem

[17:35] *** dmq joined
[17:35] <TimToady> and interesting questions arise like "when I invoke this loop block, is it really a new function call, or has it been assumed to be part of its surrounding context"

[17:37] <TimToady> but requiring hookable things of the runtime tends to produce results like P5's tie, which pessimizes every variable access because the compiler can't know which variables are someday going to be tied

[17:38] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:38] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[17:38] <TimToady> likewise, if the runtime has to keep every statement discrete because someone *might* start up a debugger on it, then we've limited optimizations involving code motion and constant subexpression removal

[17:39] <TimToady> (again, in the absence of run-time code re-emission)

[17:40] <jrockway> just take the haskell approach and say that debugging is useless :)

[17:40] <jrockway> "perl6 makes bugs impossible" [to find]

[17:40] <jrockway> :)

[17:40] * dmq notes the similarty between tie and $& in p5

[17:40] <TimToady> that's another example

[17:41] <dmq> tie is worse tho. :-(

[17:41] <TimToady> yes, you pay that penalty whether or not it's used anywhere else

[17:41] <dmq> yeah

[17:41] <dmq> and afaict tie doesnt admit some kind of hinting approach to work around the issue

[17:42] <dmq> wheras $& does

[17:42] <TimToady> basically, in parrot terms, it's the difference between a language than can use int and str registers, vs one that is always limited to pmcs

[17:43] <TimToady> the p6 solution to both the tie and $& problems is lexical scoping

[17:43] * dmq doesnt follow

[17:44] <dmq> ties can cross lexical boundaries..

[17:44] <dmq> i can see how lexical scoping helps with $&, but with tie i dont follow

[17:45] <avar> what do you mean lexical boundaries? You tie a lexical or global variable, right?

[17:45] <avar> TimToady: The tie optimization problem is a more general issue: magic

[17:46] <TimToady> the p6 compiler is allowed to assume that a variable is never tied unless explicitly declared as tieable

[17:47] <dmq> im still not following.

[17:47] <TimToady> a binding of a tied variable to an untieable variable must coerce to the current variable's storage constraints

[17:47] <TimToady> unboxing it, as it were

[17:48] <dmq> ok, so if you pass a tie into a subroutine its value is converted to an untied copy?

[17:48] <TimToady> if I have sub foo (int $x) the compiler can use an integer register

[17:48] <TimToady> you can pass a tied variable to it, but you won't get at the tie via $x

[17:48] <TimToady> it converts to int at binding time

[17:48] <dmq> which reduces the utility of tieing, but for a good payoff

[17:48] <dmq> imo

[17:49] <TimToady> it makes explicit what p5 is doing with the two sets of flags for whether we've actually evaluated the magic yet

[17:49] <TimToady> which is part of the kludginess of magic

[17:50] <Limbic_Region> Anyone able to use Net::Google::Calendar mind doing me a favor?

[17:51] <Limbic_Region> I need the result of $event->content->body() in a plain text file

[18:43] *** autark_ is now known as autark

[18:45] <TimToady> diakopter: you'd derive a grammar, define your own "rule statement" that calls into the STD statement rule and then tweaks the returned value

[18:46] <TimToady> you don't really want to attach it to the ';' literal because the parser doesn't know enough at that point
