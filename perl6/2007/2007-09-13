[10:08] <fglock> :)

[10:19] <szbalint> does anyone know how pugscode.org's architecture looks like? Is it run by Jifty? I'm planning to put some content on to perl.hu and I'm wondering what to use for it, and whether I can use the same style/css as perl.org/pugscode.org for it

[10:32] <Juerd> Probably /var/www/pugscode.org

[10:47] <knewt> so, just curios, do we think that perl6 might be completed and released within a year?

[10:48] <moritz_> yes, within a year... but I don't know which year ;-)

[10:48] <moritz_> presumably 2008

[10:49] <knewt> heh. was just wondering because i noticed that python3 is apparently supposed to be about a year away

[10:49] <moritz_> and so is duke nukem forever ;-)

[10:51] <knewt> hehe

[10:51] <moritz_> nobody is more impatient to see Perl 6 released than we are, that's why we're working on it

[10:52] <wolverian> knewt, note that python 3k is not a complete reimplementation and respecification of the language

[10:52] <wolverian> (unlike perl 6)

[10:52] <moritz_> but it's a language with quite a complex grammar and many nifty features, that's not so easy to tackle

[10:52] <knewt> what's the current status? have to admit i haven't been paying much attention just lately

[10:52] <moritz_> knewt: status of what? specs or the implementations?

[10:53] <knewt> specs

[10:53] <moritz_> "we're done with the first 80% and well into the second 80%"

[10:54] <moritz_> most things are specced, but a few things like concurrency and a few builtins are still missing

[10:54] <knewt> cool

[10:54] <moritz_> and the POD specs are currently pending

[10:55] <moritz_> knewt: http://perlcabal.org/syn/ <-- offical specs, annotated with tests and test results from pugs

[10:55] <lambdabot> Title: Official Perl 6 Documentation

[10:57] <knewt> oooh, that embedded tests with results is rather neat

[11:37] <masak> how does async blocks work? do they spawn their own threads and do stuff in that thread?

[11:52] <agentzh> masak: in Perl 6?

[11:53] <agentzh> masak: in Perl 5, i think there's a threads->join or something like that :)

[11:53] <agentzh> masak: in Perl 5, Thread::Queue is handly as well :)

[11:54] <masak> agentzh: yes, in Perl 6?

[11:54] <agentzh> masak: i knew little about Perl 6's multithread API...

[11:54] <masak> I notice it's still in the unspecced folder

[11:54] <masak> so maybe there's no answer

[11:54] <agentzh> heh

[11:54] <agentzh> maybe larry and audreyt have the answers in their head...

[11:54] <masak> I'm a fan of the async {} syntax

[11:54] <agentzh> or some random docs in their local machines..

[11:55] * agentzh too.

[11:55] <masak> but it's not immediately obvious to me how one would do a thread->join with it

[12:01] <masak> of course, there's always polling a shared variable... but that hardly sounds sanitary

[17:49] *** exp_evalbot left
[17:50] <TimToady> I never did the ^ trick with Perl because you don't know what will happen to the error message if it happens from inside an eval

[17:51] <moritz_> TimToady: you could print out parts of the eval()ed string

[17:52] <TimToady> point is, the contents of $! often get munged into a different form, and adding a ^ line tends to make it point at the wrong spot, which is worse than no pointer at all

[17:53] <moritz_> right

[17:53] <TimToady> that's why p5 just lists the two next tokens

[17:53] *** mncharity joined
[17:53] *** cognominal_ joined
[17:54] <mncharity> What is $¢ ?  (used in STD)

[17:55] <TimToady> current position of the match

[17:55] <TimToady> now equivalent to $_.pos, really, so may go away

[17:55] <mncharity> ah, ok.  tnx

[17:56] <TimToady> STD is not likely to be in a runnable state currently in any case, what with all the recent refactorings

[17:57] <TimToady> I'll need to whack on it some to get it back into the state it was in earlier

[17:57] <TimToady> also need to figure out how to propagate "lexicals" from tokens to actions without actually nesting the action within the token

[17:58] <TimToady> since the whole point is to be able to bypass the token if the DFA matcher has already matched that part

[17:58] *** francois joined
[17:58] <TimToady> so it has to fake up earlier bindings somehow

[17:59] <TimToady> alternately, it should put the routines all in one scope so it can do lexical nesting, and just have a way of bypassing the token matching part

[17:59] *** francois left
[17:59] <TimToady> might work better for anonymous subrule alternatives in any case

[18:00] * mncharity looks at log to determine refactoring delta...

[18:00] <TimToady> but if so, the "bypass token match" info has to get passed in somehow

[18:33] <TimToady> or use context vars to go up the dynamic scope to a lexical scope

[18:33] *** TJCRI left
[18:34] <TimToady> but in that case the outer lexical scope needs something like the %*ENV hash to allow arbitrary $+foo to be intercepted

[18:34] <TimToady> so that the outer lexical scope can be emulated by the DFA layer

[18:35] <TimToady> or, as you say, a way of attaching an outer dynamic scope as the genuine fake outer lexical scope :)

[18:36] <TimToady> but I need to think through anonymous alternations in any case, and how they'll propagate longest token info upward
