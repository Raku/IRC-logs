[08:05] <riffraff> hi

[08:05] <gugod> a/wg 24

[08:07] <dduncan> now, as far as I know, one can create a Capture using the syntax 

[08:08] <dduncan> \( ... ) and the use it with the syntax |$mycapt

[08:08] <dduncan> in any event, trying the last results in Pugs segfaulting

[08:10] <pasteling> "dduncan" at 24.69.53.198 pasted "trying to use a Capture results in a Pugs segfault" (6 lines, 149B) at http://sial.org/pbot/25457

[08:11] <dduncan> see the above 3 line example ... does it look like the right syntax?

[08:11] *** agentzh left
[08:13] *** rho joined
[08:14] <dduncan> actually, I didn't say foo.callwith(|$capt), just foo(|$capt)

[08:14] <dduncan> does that make a difference?

[08:14] <dduncan> trying...

[08:14] *** rho joined
[08:15] <Aankhen``> .callwith ought to just drop a caller frame, I thought.

[08:16] <dduncan> I looked at t/data_types.capture.t, and most examples there use callwith

[08:16] <dduncan> anyway, I"m trying doing that now...

[08:19] <dduncan> well, that appears to make it work, both using .callwith and prepending with a &

[08:19] <dduncan> that is, using &foo.callwith(|$capcha); rather than the segfaulting line

[09:36] <rindolf> Hi all! 

[09:36] <rindolf> See the bug in http://sial.org/pbot/25458 and see if you can reproduce or let me know what I've been doing wrong.

[09:36] <lambdabot> Title: Paste #25458 from "rindolf" at 88.155.0.7

[09:37] *** chaoslawful_ joined
[09:56] <Gothmog_> I can reproduce it, and I can't see of anything you're doing wrong; should match the empty string.

[10:04] <Gothmog_> Strange.

[10:08] *** xinming joined
[10:13] <rindolf> Gothmog_: thanks.

[10:13] <Gothmog_> This works, too: http://sial.org/pbot/25459

[10:13] <lambdabot> Title: Paste #25459 from "Gothmog" at 87.79.236.225

[10:14] <Gothmog_> Hm, perhaps I should have added \G to the second pattern, because that doesn't change the behaviour.

[10:14] *** schmalbe joined
[10:14] <Gothmog_> And it would be more clear that somethings going wrong. :-)

[10:16] <Gothmog_> So this is probably more clear: http://sial.org/pbot/25460
