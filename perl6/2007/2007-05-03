[09:06] <riffraff> inside pugs, what is the proper way to dup a string? 

[09:09] <gaal> that doesn't quite make sense in haskell context.. or do you mean dup a p6 string?

[09:10] <gaal> newStr <- newTVar (VStr "moose")

[09:10] <gaal> TVars are our mutable cells

[09:20] *** Loro_ joined
[09:20] <riffraff> of course dup'ing a p6 string

[09:20] <riffraff> I was ecpecting to use scalar_clone but that require strange STM usage that I0m not ready to understand yet :)

[09:38] <rindolf> Hi gaal, riffraff 

[09:38] <rindolf> riffraff: are you Israeli?

[09:38] <rindolf> Because I think riff-raff is Yiddish.

[09:38] <riffraff> no, I'm italian sorry, and I thiought riffraff was american :)

[09:38] <rindolf> riffraff: maybe it was.

[09:38] <rindolf> Let's check.

[09:39] <rindolf> http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=riffraff

[09:39] <lambdabot> Title: Definition of riffraff - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary

[09:39] <rindolf> Yes, it isn't Yiddish.

[09:39] <rindolf> riffraff: hey, Italians are cool.

[09:39] <rindolf> riffraff: well, some of them are.

[09:39] <riffraff> actually thinking of it we have an expression "di riffa o di raffa" in italian (di == of , o == or) which doesn't relate at all wioth the engligh meaning but it's cool 

[09:40] <rindolf> Even most probably.

[09:41] <riffraff> rindolf, I think we are genberally nice people, but I don't like italian tourists abroad, way too much and way too noisy, so I don't know if you had the right experience :)

[09:42] <rindolf> riffraff: I'm not sure I've met too many Italian people.

[09:43] <rindolf> Maybe in Israel.

[09:43] <rindolf> riffraff: I've been speaking with a couple of Croatian students on MSN.

[09:43] <rindolf> My favourite English tense is I will have been being spoken.

[09:43] <riffraff> that exists as  tense in english? OI always thought  of it as a bug in my language's grammar :)

[09:44] <rindolf> riffraff: yes, it's passive future perfect progressive.

[09:44] <riffraff> dehe

[09:48] <rindolf> riffraff: do you know any other human langs besides Italian and English?

[09:49] <rindolf> riffraff: I know Hebrew, and a little Arabic and even less French. (Don't know Italian).

[09:49] <rindolf> riffraff: do you still live in .it?

[09:49] <riffraff> I knew enough about latin, had it in school for 6 years, I can understand latin languages when written and I have _a clue_ on how hungarian and japanese work, but I can't  seriously understand them 

[09:51] <riffraff> yeah I do live in it, even though from september to february I was an exchange student in budapest,hungary. Great place, but  fun & uber-hard language

[09:52] <riffraff> rindolf, hebrew seems cool, sadly I'm stuck at "cheers" and don't even know how to spell it :)

[09:53] <rindolf> riffraff: you mean Lehayim?

[09:53] <riffraff> yep

[09:53] <rindolf> riffraff: szabgab knows Hungarian.

[09:54] <rindolf> riffraff: OK.

[09:54] <riffraff> mh.. szab seems to be the stem for "free" and gab seem to be the beginning of my first name (gabriele). Interesting coincidence :)

[09:54] <rindolf> riffraff: the Hebrew Alphabet is easy, but the problem is that it is usually written without the vowels.

[09:54] <rindolf> riffraff: His name is Gabor Szabo.

[09:55] <rindolf> He has too accents on his name.

[09:55] <rindolf> Which I don't remember where they are.

[09:55] <rindolf> He is named like the Jazz guitarist.

[09:55] <rindolf> But he is not the same person.

[09:55] <riffraff> well gabor and gabriele are the same name, as far as I can tell, hungarians translate names in interesting way (stephan -> istvan)

[15:25] <jerrylee> [particle]: in the pugs code

[15:25] <jerrylee> [particle]: i am reading it

[15:25] <[particle]> there's a client, which generates and sends smoke output

[15:25] <[particle]> and a server, which receives and displays it

[15:26] <[particle]> as i remember, anyway. i haven't looked at the code in a long time

[15:28] <jerrylee> [particle]: what's smoke output?

[15:29] <[particle]> smoke is a make target, like test, or install

[15:29] <jerrylee> i see

[15:29] <[particle]> it runs the test suite and generates output that can be displayed later

[15:30] *** elmex joined
[15:30] <[particle]> multiple machines submit smoke reports to the smoke server, which consolidates them on a nice page for display and comparison

[15:30] <gaal> jerrylee: http://smoke.pugscode.org/

[15:30] <[particle]> so we can see for example that a set of tests is passing on x86-linux but failing on osx-darwin

[15:32] <jerrylee> i see, so it's a way to share the make results for developers?

[15:32] <[particle]> yes

[15:32] <[particle]> it's also a way for a single developer to track progress of test results over time

[15:32] <[particle]> for example you submit smoke report for r123 and r456

[15:33] <[particle]> you can compare the pass/fail/skip/todo test results between revisions

[15:34] <jerrylee> [particle]: cool

[15:34] *** riffraff joined
[15:34] <[particle]> i think so

[15:34] <riffraff> someone as an example of something that does Str ?

[15:36] <riffraff> ah maybe found nevermind

[15:39] <gaal> you can test it by calling subst on vv("moose").subst(/oo/, "00") instead of plain "moose".subst(...)

[15:41] <riffraff> ok, let's try to be slow :) 

[15:41] <riffraff> what is Meta.Str ?

[15:41] <riffraff> Str's metaclass? what is it for?

[15:41] * jerrylee is sleepy

[15:42] <riffraff> Str.HOW says that it's metaclass is Class, afaict

[15:43] <riffraff> once I know what is Met.Str: what is vv ?

[15:44] *** ofer joined

[15:46] <riffraff> because Prelude.pm seems to use the Str class for everything but it doesn't sound right

[15:56] <riffraff> Oh I see

[16:03] <riffraff> TimToady, is there any difference between $str.match(/rgx/) and $str ~~ /rgx/ ? 

[16:03] <TimToady> not that I can think of

[16:04] <TimToady> just a difference of precedence

[16:06] <riffraff> ok, thanks

[16:11] <riffraff> I was thinking: what is the exact signature for subst & match ? I think it makes sense to allow strings as patterns but that would make them behave slightly differently from s/// and m///

[16:12] <riffraff> or maybe more similar, depending on the point of view

[16:18] <gaal> riffraff: look at the logs from http://moritz.faui2k3.org/irclog/out.pl?channel=perl6;date=2007-04-29#id_l125

[16:18] <lambdabot> Title: IRC log for #perl6, http://tinyurl.com/2hrh5o

[16:18] <gaal> that's re: MO, vv, Meta, and so on

[16:18] <riffraff> I see thanks for the link I'll investigate

[16:21] *** veritos joined
[16:24] <TimToady> riffraff: it's a good question.  s/// and m// are implemented in terms of .subst and .match, but that doesn't mean that they have to be exactly equivalent, as long as the methods are a superset of capabilities and the mapping from one to the other is stable.

[16:25] <TimToady> and as for prior art, we allow a constant string to .split now

[16:25] <veritos> TimToady: no no pesky convert-to-regex-ing now? sweet.

[16:25] <veritos> i made much use of the literal markers

[16:26] <TimToady> if something is a FAQ in P5, it probably is changed in P6...

[16:27] <TimToady> FAQs are a design smell...

[16:27] <veritos> but perl 6 has faqs too!

[16:27] <veritos> i should know--i spent 2hrs yesterday fixing them up.

[16:27] <TimToady> hopefully p6 smells different...  :)

[16:27] *** Phocean_ joined
[16:28] <TimToady> well, I always overgeneralize.  :)

[16:28] <veritos> ah. but is not the purpose of v6 to make one smell like the other?

[16:29] <veritos> "nor has the camel evolved to smell good."

[16:29] <TimToady> I wonder what mooses smell like...

[16:29] <offby1> eww.

[16:30] <offby1> that's how.

[16:30] <[particle]> eggs.

[16:30] <veritos> i lived in alaska for ages. i had one in my backyard. in a hot tub.

[16:30] <veritos> they don't actually smell too bad.

[16:30] <offby1> A moose bit my sister once.

[16:30] <offby1> (y'all knew that was coming.)

[16:30] <veritos> a moose once bit my sister. get it right.

[16:31] <riffraff> TimToady, nice to know thanks. I think I'll implement it in my next "mostly harmless hack" session :)

[16:31] <gaal> veritos: you mean you had a pet moose you kept in your hot tub? or that it was a random visitor?

[16:32] <veritos> random.

[16:32] <veritos> but the kiddy pool pic i just posted is funnier

[16:32] <gaal> not for the moose

[16:40] <torz> you signed my colleague's keyboard last year

[16:40] <TimToady> I will sign anything that my wife would let me sign.  :D

[16:40] <torz> hahahaha!!

[16:40] <torz> awesome

[16:41] <TimToady> wanted to come to yapc this year but was double booked.

[16:41] <veritos> we should have one in oregon.

[16:41] <torz> oh... I only had time to go to Audrey's talk on the first day :(

[16:41] <veritos> that covers merlyn, ingy, and you.

[16:41] <TimToady> I thought you were in Seattle

[16:42] <veritos> and i somewhat prefer oregon anyway

[16:42] <TimToady> less sales tax, anyway...

[16:42] <veritos> indeed

[16:42] <TimToady> infinitely less, by one reckoning

[16:43] <[particle]> ingy's in seattle, well he will be in a few days

[16:43] <[particle]> less income tax in washington, though

[16:44] <veritos> [particle]: you from here also?

[16:44] <[particle]> here being seattle? yes

[16:44] <TimToady> in California we have a lot of everything, though we did something about the prop taxes some time back... :)

[16:45] <torz> tax in japan is pretty frustrating also

[16:45] <TimToady> the cost of living in Tokyo is amazing

[16:46] <TimToady> the thing I find awesome though is how the city mixes skyscrapers and little houses together

[17:06] <torz> btw, one of my colleague says I should talk to your about japanese anime.

[17:07] <TimToady> yeah, we watch almost everything we can get our hands on.  well, everything decent...

[17:07] <torz> hahaha, nice.

[17:07] <torz> just recently (last night actually) watched a movie called innocent.

[17:08] <TimToady> anime?

[17:08] <torz> way too complicated, guess its one of those movies that you have to watch atleast twice to understand it.

[17:08] <torz> yep

[17:08] <TimToady> it usually takes a year or two to get over here

[17:08] <TimToady> unless they plan a simultaneous release

[17:09] <TimToady> I'll keep my eyes open for it

[17:10] <cmarcelo> moose! any of you know if there's an english version of Perl 6 Today slides? most recent I found in english is from the talk at Google...

[17:12] <TimToady> good movie

[17:12] <torz> good eh

[17:12] <TimToady> the visuals were pretty stunning

[17:13] <torz> indeed

[17:14] <torz> ガンダムすき？

[17:14] <cmarcelo> :-P

[17:15] <TimToady> gandamu?  I don't know what that is...

[17:15] <torz> bullocks :p

[17:15] <TimToady> Gundam!

[17:15] <torz> yep

[17:15] <TimToady> sorry...

[17:15] <TimToady> yes, we've watched a lot of that, though not recently

[17:16] <TimToady> early gundam in the US was very badly edited, but more recent stuff is better

[17:16] <TimToady> or maybe I'm thinking of macross...

[17:17] <TimToady> for some reason those blur together in my head

[17:18] <torz> havent watched macross... 

[17:18] <torz> it is a good watch?

[17:18] <torz> uhh, is it a good watch

[17:19] <TimToady> it's pretty good, a little more about culture and a little less about fighting than gundam, but not much different

[17:19] <torz> I heard Naruto is quite popular in the US of the A.

[17:19] <torz> oops US of A more rather

[17:20] *** larsen joined
[17:20] <torz> ahhh series with political thoughts are awesome

[17:20] <TimToady> for some reason we haven't watched Naruto yet.  I've heard of it a lot.

[17:21] <TimToady> maybe we were too poor when it first came out

[17:21] <torz> it'll suck a looooot of your time if you start watching it

[17:21] <TimToady> we were borrowing a lot from my brother-in-law at that point, and maybe it just never came over from his house

[17:21] <torz> ah

[17:22] <TimToady> or maybe my wife didn't like it for some reason.  don't recall offhand...

[17:27] <TimToady> I don't recognize it

[17:28] <TimToady> what is mixi

[17:28] <TimToady> ?

[17:28] <torz> hmmm the largest SNS service in Japan entirely written in perl

[17:29] <TimToady> yeah, I just googled for it.  :)

[17:29] <torz> one of the platinum sponsors of YAPC::Asia this year heh

[17:29] <torz> good old google!

[17:29] <TimToady> kakkoii

[17:29] <torz> what is? google?

[17:29] <TimToady> that mixi is in perl

[17:29] <torz> oh that

[17:30] <torz> yeah, totally LAMP

[17:30] <torz> where P = Perl  :D

[17:30] <TimToady> one would expect a certain amount of P = Ruby in Japan...

[17:30] *** franck__ joined
[17:31] <torz> ha

[17:31] <TimToady> which I guess is P interpreted as a Greek rho

[17:32] <TimToady> or cyrillic

[17:34] *** mdiep_ joined
[17:34] <TimToady> but then a classical greek would have had little idea what 'L' means...

[17:34] <TimToady> A and M work though

[17:34] <torz> わからない

[17:35] <TimToady> greek has capital letters for A M and P, but not L

[17:35] <torz> oh

[17:35] <TimToady> looks like Λ  instead

[17:35] <torz> would *NAMP work?

[17:37] <TimToady> but also P == 'R' in greek, so the p sound would be Π 

[17:37] *** Psyche^ joined
[17:37] <torz> hmm just going through the search results for mixi on google, english pages are outdated :(

[17:39] <TimToady> they all have their good points and their bad points.

[22:39] <TimToady> thanks!

[22:39] <avar> it's an Icelandic programming language, I was going to be really hip and use icelandic chars:)

[22:39] <TimToady> I agree, urgh

[22:39] <avar> but rule names will do:)

[22:44] <dmq> windows 2k groks unicode filenames, for a limited definition of unicode.

[22:45] <TimToady> well, it didn't like ö for some reason

[22:45] <TimToady> I suppose something's configgered rong

[22:45] <dmq> in what context?

[22:46] *** mr_ank joined
[22:46] <TimToady> svn knows it's in utf-8, but couldn't convert

[22:46] <dmq> encoded as what?

[22:46] <avar> I don't think svn knows that it's utf-8 at all

[22:46] <TimToady> the error message talked about utf-8

[22:46] <avar> which is presumably the problem

[22:46] <avar> hrm

[22:46] <dmq> ah, right, svn probably doesnt know about the widechar interface, and probably doesnt know the filename is utf8 encoded anyway.

[22:47] <dmq> scratch the last part.

[22:47] <avar> maybe it guessed or I sent locale info over in the commit?

[22:47] <dmq> perl doesnt know about the widechar interface either.

[22:47] <TimToady> that's likely the problem here

[22:48] <TimToady> anyway, it just gave up on the checkout

[22:48] <TimToady> nothing else depends on that filename, so it's not a major issue in this case

[22:48] <dmq> something to keep in mind for a C implementation of Perl 6, dont use char *'s as parameters for system routines. :-)

[22:48] <TimToady> the Makefile just gathers *.t in the normal fashion

[22:49] <TimToady> what is this C that you mention?  is it like Java?

[22:49] * dmq might go so far as to say dont use char * for anything...

[22:49] <dmq> its this language i learned to hack on this language that you invented...

[22:49] * TimToady might go so fars as to say don't use C for anything

[22:50] <avar> if you need awesome fastness use Common Lisp and SBCL:)

[22:50] <dmq> blech.

[22:50] <TimToady> the first Ada compiler was in SETL

[22:51] <dmq> I have to say, im really glad that Perl gave me an excuse to do some real C programming. That is entirely beside the fact that Perl gave me an excuse to do Perl programming.

[22:51] <TimToady> primal C therapy...
