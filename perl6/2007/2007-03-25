[00:27] <lanny> If a test doesn't parse but still passes is that a :todo or a successful test?  I'm leaning towards :todo<parse> but I find examples (regex/from_perl6_rules) which seem to say otherwise.  Any opinions welcome.

[00:31] <Juerd> It's a todo test if the feature isn't implemented yet

[00:31] <Juerd> It's a real test if the test demonstrates a bug

[00:31] <Juerd> In any case, if it's about parsing, wrap it in eval.

[00:31] <lanny> Ugh.  Maybe I'll go back to being too busy to work on pugs again.  :)

[00:32] <lanny> But yes, that's in line with what I was thinking (at least about test validity).  Thanks.

[00:32] <lanny> Oddly it isn't parsing but the test file continues on.  I recall a time that non-parse would kill remaining tests.

[00:33] <lanny> It's in the regex engine which I'm guessing is robust enough to die without killing the rest of the process.

[00:43] <Limbic_Region> oh hey

[00:43] <Limbic_Region> lanny - can I /msg you or are you not around again?

[00:46] <lanny> I'm here

[00:46] <lanny> pugscode.org seems to resolve again on my work box

[00:58] <TimToady> geoffb: did you supply a terminating case as well with sig ()?  *$head still requires a parameter.

[01:01] <geoffb> TimToady: OH!  I assumed P5 slurping ... so when the list went empty *$head would be undef

[01:01] <geoffb> (yes, I know that the test above assumed "false" not "undef", but that was my minimal variant of a larger broken routine)

[01:01] <dduncan> I have a quick opinion question about module versioning ...

[01:02] <dduncan> does it seem unreasonable to release the first version of an in-development module as version 0.0.0, say, rather than 0.1.0 or 0.0.1 ?

[01:02] <TimToady> geoffb: it's more like Haskell, so you get to write the null case too.

[01:02] <dduncan> something analagous is what Pugs did

[01:02] <geoffb> TimToady: OK, so do I have to provide all of (*$head, *$neck, *@tail), (*$head, *$neck), (*$head), and () signatures?

[01:03] <TimToady> no *@tail can be empty.

[01:03] <dduncan> and it is then visually similar to 1.0.0 later, in that the non-major versions are all zero

[01:03] <lanny> Juerd: Any chance of feather upgrade for SVN::Mirror from clkao's unreleased version which fixes 'RA layer request failed'?  Given sudo I can do the needful but understand if sudo isn't given out like commitbit.  :)

[01:03] <TimToady> s/no/no,/

[01:04] <TimToady> and you can probably even get away with saying *$neck? to make it optional.

[01:04] <geoffb> OK, so I'll need (*$head, *$neck?, *@tail) and (), right?

[01:04] <dduncan> I'm hoping to release the first QDRDBMS any day now, and currently prefer to simply make it version zero, rather than some small increment above zero, as seems to be common on CPAN ... are you aware that such a versioning may cause any problems?

[01:04] <TimToady> could probably even have *$head? as optional, but writing the () case seems easier than testing

[01:05] <geoffb> So what do you get when you try to use an optional arg that is missing?

[01:05] <Aankhen``> dduncan: Sorry to interrupt, but what is the "QD" in QDRDBMS?

[01:05] <tene> dduncan: my thought about the "non-major versions are all zero" issue is that 0.0.0 is the "doesn't have any code at all" version

[01:06] <geoffb> aka "Skeleton straight out of skeleton generator"

[01:07] <dduncan> "quick and dirty" ... because it is an early draft version

[01:07] <Aankhen``> Ah, okay.

[01:07] <TimToady> presumably replacing QD with something else at some point, in which case the version number doesn't matter much.

[01:08] <TimToady> see Pugs 6.28 < Perl 6 for instance

[01:08] <dduncan> the mature term name will be completely different, most likely

[01:08] <TimToady> CDRDBMS

[01:08] <TimToady> and now for something completely different...

[01:09] <tene> Clean and Drawn-Out?

[01:09] <dduncan> I'm actually thinking of calling it "Muldis", unless some better name can be suggested

[01:09] <dduncan> the idea is to use a nonexistent word and brand it

[01:09] <dduncan> so I made one up, and that is it

[01:09] <tene> Good plan.  I like the name.

[01:11] <Aankhen``> Are recursive regexes still on the books for the initial release of Perl 6?

[01:11] <geoffb> Dangit, for some reason I thought sub defaulted to multi, but maybe I was thinking of 'our'

[01:11] <dduncan> the first QDRDBMS release will be probably complete to about the same degree that the first Pugs release was ... it'll do next to nothing, but it'll do something at least, and enough for people to get an idea of how to use it

[01:11] <TimToady> do you mean self-recursive without naming?

[01:11] <Aankhen``> Yes.

[01:11] <dduncan> its mainly a skeleton, that will then be developed

[01:12] <TimToady> it doesn't seem terribly difficult, just haven't specced the syntax yet.  <self> comes to mind...
