[16:54] <masak> good *ing, dlocaus

[16:59] <moritz_> dlocaus: checking...

[16:59] <moritz_> iirc some tests fail, yes

[17:00] <dlocaus> I'm getting failures, on tests I don't normally get failures on.

[17:00] <dlocaus> /usr/bin/perl script/run_tests_kp6_mp6.pl

[17:00] <dlocaus> t/p5/ has no tests, this is not an error, just a warning at script/run_tests_kp6_mp6.pl line 30.

[17:00] <dlocaus> (everything)

[17:00] <moritz_> these work fine for me

[17:01] <moritz_> all up to t/kp6/35-undef.t work

[17:01] <moritz_> and startin from 36-multi there are some failures

[17:02] <dlocaus> humm

[17:02] <moritz_> Test::Harness to 3.0?

[17:02] <dlocaus> yes

[17:02] <dlocaus> I wonder if that's what is doing it?

[17:18] <dlocaus> I'm thinking that it would be good to do

[17:18] <dlocaus> eval { require 'TAP::Harness'; }

[17:18] <dlocaus> if ( $@ ) {

[19:32] <dlocaus> it does.

[19:32] <moritz_> and you have TAP::Harness installed, right?

[20:18] <moritz_> or the like
