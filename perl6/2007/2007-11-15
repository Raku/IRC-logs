[02:24] <mncharity> From another channel:  A historian who spoke last week in SF says that every project looks like failure in midstream, even right up to before the end.  (Indeed if you stopped then, you *would* fail...)   so it's important to enjoy the process all the way through, if possible.

[02:25] <mncharity> @tell fglock This went by on another channel, thought you might like it:   A historian who spoke last week in SF says that every project looks like failure in midstream, even right up to before the end.

[07:43] <Teratogen> what is to keep Perl 6 from turning into an academic language?

[07:44] <moritz_> good morning

[07:45] <Teratogen> greetings and felicitations

[07:45] <moritz_> Teratogen: what makes you think that that's a danger?

[07:45] <Teratogen> the direction that the language is taking

[07:46] <faxathisia> I think Perl 6 would be suitable for teaching as well

[07:46] *** penk left
[07:46] <moritz_> Teratogen: could you elaborate a bit more?

[07:48] <Tene> Teratogen: I'm interested in and curious about what you're referring to.

[07:50] <Teratogen> it all started with sigil invariance, imho

[07:50] <Teratogen> very un-Perlish

[07:51] <Teratogen> Junctions seem to be an academic add-on

[07:52] <Teratogen> and why not just have a simple but powerful text macro facility, like perl -P ?

[07:52] *** iblechbot left
[07:52] <Teratogen> why did Larry include -P in the first place?

[07:52] <Teratogen> because it is powerful

[07:52] <moritz_> I never used it

[07:53] <Teratogen> a textual macro preprocessor would be nice

[07:53] <moritz_> and I never saw/heard anybody recommending it

[07:53] <Teratogen> then why does -P exist?

[07:53] <moritz_> historical reasons?

[07:53] <Teratogen> because the C preprocessor is very powerful

[07:53] <Teratogen> ans simple

[07:54] <faxathisia> Teratogen: I thought Junctions are pretty useful

[07:54] *** dlocaus joined
[07:54] <moritz_> I think that sigil invariance is quite perlish, because it's very intuitive for beginners

[07:54] <rgs> perl -P has been deprecated in perl 5

[07:54] <Tene> Teratogen: I was curious about the utility of junctions before I wrote code using them.

[07:54] <Tene> Now I like them.

[07:55] *** idiotmax joined
[07:55] <dlocaus> @tell fglock I did not make much progress on refactoring $::Value out of MOP.pm, there is some intertwining with other classes, I wasn't sure how to handle. I will resume work on it tomorrow afternoon.

[07:55] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[07:55] *** pen1 left
[07:55] <dlocaus> moritz_: you are still up?

[07:55] <moritz_> dlocaus: I just got up ;)

[07:55] <Teratogen> will Perl 6 ever replace Perl 5?

[07:56] <Teratogen> there, a simpler question.

[07:56] <dlocaus> oh, I'm going to sleep :)

[07:56] <Teratogen> good night

[07:56] <moritz_> dlocaus: I'm in Europe, it's 9AM here ;)

[07:56] <moritz_> dlocaus: good night ;)

[07:56] <Teratogen> it's 1 AM here but I will be up all night!

[07:56] * dlocaus waves

[07:56] <moritz_> Teratogen: I think it will, but it will take lots of time...

[07:56] *** dlocaus left
[07:56] <moritz_> perhaps 5 to 10 years after perl 6 is released

[07:56] <Teratogen> that's a good question

[07:56] <Teratogen> when will Perl 6 be released?

[07:57] <Teratogen> is there any rush to production?

[07:57] <moritz_> you see, there are still people around who use perl 5.6

[07:57] <moritz_> even though that's _really_ old

[07:57] <Teratogen> I still see code that has "use 5.004" in it

[07:57] <moritz_> omg

[07:57] <moritz_> there's no release date

[07:57] <moritz_> the canonical answer is "christmas"

[07:58] <moritz_> but we don't say which christmas

[07:58] <Tene> Parrot has some scheduled release dates, but that's for Parrot, not for Perl 6.

[07:58] <moritz_> and once perl 6 is released, every day is christmas ;)

[07:59] <Teratogen> what's to keep Perl 6 from becoming just another flavor of Lisp?

[07:59] <moritz_> the syntax

[07:59] <moritz_> that's one of the big differences... lisp has very cool semantics, but a clumsy syntax

[07:59] <Aankhen``> Teratogen: You do realize that most languages qualify as Lisps?

[08:00] <Teratogen> you can write a Lisp pretty easily in most languages, I suppose

[08:00] <Teratogen> is that what you are saying?

[08:02] <moritz_> the more a language evolves, the more it feels like lisp

[08:02] <Teratogen> not C

[08:02] <Teratogen> C has pretty much evolved

[08:02] <Teratogen> and it is definitely not Lisp

[08:02] <moritz_> yes, there are excpetions ;)

[08:02] <Teratogen> and C has a helluva good macro preprocessor!

[08:02] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Pfft, there's nothing clumsy about it.  You simply haven't seen the light yet! :-P

[08:02] <Aankhen``> Teratogen: How much Perl 6 code have you written?

[08:02] <faxathisia> no not really CPP is quite bad

[08:02] <moritz_> it's just text replacement

[08:02] <Teratogen> zero lines of Perl 6

[08:02] <Aankhen``> <Teratogen> and C has a helluva good macro preprocessor! # LMAO.

[08:02] <Teratogen> Aankhen what is bad about it?

[08:02] <moritz_> Aankhen``: aye, I haven't seen it. Feel free to enlighten me

[08:02] <Aankhen``> Teratogen: Ah, well, if I may, I suggest you try writing some Perl 6 and see just how "academic" it feels to you.

[08:02] <Teratogen> ok

[08:03] <Aankhen``> What is bad about textual replacement of source code?  Are you asking a serious question? o_O

[08:03] <faxathisia> Teratogen: It's string and line based textual replacement.. That's does not reflect the structure of a C program

[08:03] <Teratogen> it's still very powerful for such a simple facility

[08:03] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Oh, enlightenment has to be gained for yourself. ;-)

[08:03] <Teratogen> file inclusion, macros, macros with arguments, conditional compilation

[08:03] <moritz_> Aankhen``: oh come on, don't be such a git ;)

[08:03] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Er, wha?

[08:04] *** franck___ joined
[08:04] <Aankhen``> Teratogen: Sure, it's a reasonably powerful hack.

[08:04] <faxathisia> Perl 6 is not going to be another lisp since it doesn't have homoiconicity

[08:05] <Teratogen> fax, that sounds so gay

[08:05] <Teratogen> =)

[08:05] <faxathisia> (being lisp isn't really a goal for a programming language though.. hopefully)

[08:05] * Teratogen has to look up that word

[08:05] <Teratogen> homowhaticity?

[08:06] <faxathisia> Teratogen: data and code having the same structure and being able to translate between the two, roughly 

[08:06] <faxathisia> Perl 6 doesn't work that way, but that's not a bad thing [if everybody looked the same..]

[08:08] <Teratogen> ah

[08:10] <moritz_> IRC is such an evil time killer

[08:11] <Tene> faxathisia: actually, I was pretty sure that it would... Perl 6 will ship with a Perl 6 grammar...

[13:43] <moritz_> pugs build or pugs execution?

[13:43] <Zaba> execution

[13:44] <Zaba> it takes a lot of time to load into interactive mode, or to run a script, and execution itself is slow

[13:50] <moritz_> Zaba: there's no schedule

[13:50] <moritz_> it's release when it's done

[13:50] <Zaba> well

[13:51] <moritz_> currently there's very little pugs activity, due to audreyt++ being absent
