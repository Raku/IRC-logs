[08:20] <pmurias> what is DIP6?

[08:21] <Aankhen``> I just shortened Dive Into Perl 6.

[08:23] <Aankhen``> Wow, kp6 has a rather detailed roadmap.

[08:29] <pmurias> it's a bit long term thought

[08:44] <thoughtpolice> moritz: i saw. :)

[08:45] <thoughtpolice> moritz: the next one's one rules, so it's going to be long; right now it looks like I might split it into two parts

[08:45] <thoughtpolice> it would probably be done already if not for being somewhat busy and things being hectic

[08:45] <thoughtpolice> but it'll get done. :)

[08:46] <thoughtpolice> on a side note my new blog is done. weeee. now the server just needs python/web.py support :/

[08:47] <thoughtpolice> considering it's roughly 4:00am here I might as well go ahead and work on it, though. :)

[08:49] <thoughtpolice> i should probably update my pugs repo however.

[11:50] <thoughtpolice> letting my hands rest

[11:54] <wolverian> thoughtpolice, you have some apostrophe errors. search for 's for an example. :)

[11:55] <wolverian> namely: grammar's, regex's (regexes), macro's.

[12:05] <moritz> thoughtpolice: I like your post... but of course you could do another one on rules

[12:07] <thoughtpolice> wolverian: i'm not exactly the best on usage of such things. :(

[12:07] <thoughtpolice> moritz: that's what I'm thinking

[12:08] <thoughtpolice> it might not be the next one I write, but that's where I think it'll go

[12:10] <wolverian> thoughtpolice, the rules are pretty simple. only use an apostrophe to mark either a contraction or a possessive.

[12:10] <thoughtpolice> i knew I should have paid attention during those parts of english.

[12:11] <thoughtpolice> but thanks. :)

[12:11] <wolverian> you don't need lectures to remember those two rules, though! :) I hope...

[12:11] <wolverian> (okay, I did.)

[12:12] <thoughtpolice> well, I mean more in relation to parts of speech. i never really bothered with it, because i'm too much of a bum when it comes to such things.

[12:13] *** diakopter is now known as diakopter_afk

[12:15] <thoughtpolice> moritz: don't worry though. so far I've pretty much planned for an 'unnofficial round 4b,' and I'm hoping it will cover much more of the magic than what I described in this one. we'll have to wait and see. :)

[12:15] <wolverian> (there are some exceptions too; the possessive of "it" is "its", not "it's".)

[12:15] <thoughtpolice> wolverian: i'll admit I know that one. :)

[13:15] *** fglock joined
[13:16] <fglock> pmurias: looking

[13:17] <fglock> first thing is to copy Token.pm into (for example) RegexPCR.pm

[13:18] <fglock> you can either recompile the regex from source, or transform the AST (better)

[13:18] <fglock> and then call the PCR emitter

[13:20] *** ruoso_ joined
[13:20] <fglock> this doesn't look good - we would need a new AST node for the Perl 5 code generated by PCR

[13:21] <fglock> probably just do ::Apply eval('source', 'Perl5')

[13:22] <args> ::Apply and not Thanks::Apply ?

[13:22] <args> that's rude

[13:22] <fglock> args: :)

[13:22] <fglock> pmurias: we need something that scale to other backends

[13:24] <fglock> subclassing EmitPerl5 is probably better

[13:24] <fglock> just redefine ::Token

[13:27] <fglock> pmurias: re PCR faster, I don't think so

[13:29] <fglock> PCR-in-perl5regex would be much faster, but it's incomplete

[17:24] <beppu> What's the IRC channel for this year's YAPC?

[17:26] <Aankhen``> I thought `token foo { ... }` is like `regex foo { ^ ... }` except that ^ refers to the position at which you start matching rather than the actual beginning of the string.

[17:26] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[17:26] *** diakopter joined
[17:29] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: er, no.  token just never backtrack like regex would.

[17:31] <diakopter> beppu: irc.perl.org#yapc

[17:33] <beppu> diakopter: thanks

[17:33] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: I guess I misunderstood.

[17:33] <Aankhen``> I'll try and figure out what it means to backtrack or not to backtrack later.

[17:34] <PerlJam> regex is "normal",  token is regex + :ratchet (no backtracking under normal circumstances), and rule is regex + :ratchet + :sigspace (whitespace lexically between portions of your RE actually match whitespace in your stream)

[17:35] <Aankhen``> Yes, I'm just not sure what it means to backtrack vs. not backtrack.

[17:36] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: backtracking is just about trying alternatives when the "tail" end of the regex fails to match.  You back up and try the next alternative (if there is one)

[17:37] <Aankhen``> I have to run for now, but I shall have more questions later. :-)

[20:00] <wolverian> that's actually an interesting issue.

[20:01] *** devbot6 joined
[20:03] <[particle]> Aankhen``: consider the regex /x+xy/. in order for it to match 'xxy', it first eats both 'x' during the  'x+' portion of the match.

[20:03] <devbot6> dev: Ticket #25 (defect closed): dmqnujxc <http://dev.pugscode.org/ticket/25#comment:1>

[20:04] <[particle]> Aankhen``: but it fails, because it can't find another 'x' after the two it's eaten. so, it backtracks, and tries matching the 'x+' with 'x'.

[20:05] <[particle]> then the 'xy' in the pattern matches 'xy' in the string

[20:05] <Aankhen``> [particle]: Right.

[20:05] <[particle]> so token xxy { x+ xy } will never match anything

[20:05] <[particle]> (no backtracking)

[20:06] <[particle]> x+ matches all the 'x', and can't go back and try one less

[20:06] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[20:07] *** GabrielVieira joined
[20:07] <[particle]> well, it's useful for matching tokens in grammars (hence the name)

[20:17] <Aankhen``> Kewl.

[20:17] <Aankhen``> So much factory classes? :-D

[20:21] <Aankhen``> Okay, is `token` simply for reasons of efficiency, then?

[20:21] <Randal> Oh yeah, i guess this channel will be quiet because everyone's at YAPC. :)

[20:24] <TimToady> Aankhen``: notational convenience and communication of intent, primarily

[20:24] <Aankhen``> Mmm, mmm, mmm.

[20:24] <Aankhen``> And furthermore, mmm.

[20:24] <offby1> quiet,  you.

[20:24] * Aankhen`` whines.

[20:24] * offby1 bleats

[20:25] <Aankhen``> Now you're just being silly.

[20:25] <offby1> never.

[20:25] <TimToady> I'm never silly...

[20:26] <Aankhen``> TimToady: You're missing out.

[20:26] <diakopter> TimToady is also never sarcastic

[20:26] <[particle]> no, really?!?!

[20:26] <Aankhen``> Absolutely.

[20:27] <Aankhen``> ibrown: I was just confirming that the backtracking controls only apply to the quantifiers, e.g. *, +, ?

[20:28] <TimToady> and **{$m..$n}

[20:28] <Aankhen``> I always figured "e.g." was "for example". <G>

[20:28] <Aankhen``> Come to think of it, my mother told me once that it used the be the other way around.

[20:28] <TimToady> I was adding another e.g.  :)

[20:28] <Aankhen``> Bah.

[20:28] <Aankhen``> My examples need no annotation!

[20:29] * diakopter considers how to better structure the pugs svn repo (noting things such as /INSTALL and /INSTALL.v6-alpha and the disambiguating line in /INSTALL.v6-alpha)

[20:31] * diakopter waits for bright ideas

[20:34] * TimToady almost never has bright ideas about this "structure" concept...

[20:35] <Aankhen``> thoughtpolice: One suggestion for the post. Instead of "In perl 6 rules, like perl 5 regexes, you have a lot of special characters you can use inside your rules for specific purposes", you might want to mention that all non–word characters are metasyntactic.

[21:24] <Aankhen``> Er, actually, un-ping.

[21:24] <Aankhen``> Sorry.

[21:28] <offby1> if you love a ping ... set it free

[21:30] * Aankhen`` reluctantly lets go of the ping.
