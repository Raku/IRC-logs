[02:52] <adorablepuppy> hello

[02:54] <Tene> Hi!

[02:57] <adorablepuppy> I need regex help. :) Though I am currently asking in #regex.

[02:58] <Tene> I can help you with Perl 6 Rules, which are the replacement for regexes.

[02:58] <adorablepuppy> ok

[02:59] <Tene> If you want regex help, though, #regex or #perl are better places.

[03:00] <adorablepuppy> thanks

[13:38] <avar> fglock: What does bdb have to do with /threads/?

[13:38] <avar> Use it to store something related to them

[13:38] <avar> ?

[13:38] <allbery_b> several packages use bdb's locking specifically for thread synchronization, ignoring the actual database foo

[13:41] *** ferreira joined
[13:41] <fglock> i'm not particularly interested on bdb, just fast threads

[13:43] <ferreira> hi folks! I invite you to take a look at the next article on Perl 6 operators: http://feather.perl6.nl/~ferreira/perl6-operators/compare2.html

[13:43] <lambdabot> Title: compare2.pod6

[13:48] <fglock> ferreira: @values.sort( { $^b cmp $^a } )  # don't need the arrow

[13:49] <fglock>  @values.sort: { $^b cmp $^a }   # don't need paren

[13:50] *** felipe left
[13:51] *** zomgb00bie joined
[13:55] *** lyokato left
[13:57] <ferreira> fglock: ok. This is much prettier ;-) That means placeholders are not only for -> { } things ?

[13:57] <rhr> in fact I think placeholder vars are illegal in pointy blocks by S06:1402

[13:57] <ferreira> oops

[13:58] *** amnesiac joined
[13:59] <Gothmog_> But you could write -> $a, $b { $b cmp $a } iirc

[13:59] <Gothmog_> That of course isn't as nice as { $^b cmp $^a }. :)

[13:59] <ferreira> now fixed. 

[13:59] <rhr> TimToady: should S04:293 have the -> removed because of the $^thing ?

[14:00] <ferreira> Gothmog_: that's exactly what I thought ;-)

[14:00] <Juerd> ferreira: Comments like "0 before 1" are vague. Do they describe the code? the return value? 

[14:02] <ferreira> hum, not really, I just thought of that as anterior to introducing Order::Increase, etc.

[14:03] *** Jedai joined
[14:04] <masak> ferreira: nice article

[14:04] <ferreira> maybe some extra words would convey the intented meaning, without having to repeat Order::Increase, ::Same, ::Decrease thrice. What do you think of "answers 0 before 1" instead of just "0 before 1" and so on?

[14:04] <ferreira> masak: thanks, you're very kind

[14:05] <masak> in a real-life app, @values.sort: { $^b cmp $^a } should probably be just @values.sort.reverse or similar, because of higher readability

[14:05] <masak> but as a proof-of-concept, your example code is just fine

[14:06] <Juerd> ferreira: Operators don't "answer"... They return or evaluate. A full sentence may be in order if you want to avoid the classes

[14:09] *** arguile_ is now known as arguile

[14:10] <ferreira> masak: got that. I prefered the redundancy that causes 'cmp' to be used. The last example as well would be better written with KeyExtractor's, but I don't even know how to write them, but I think it would be something like:

[14:10] *** ruz joined
[14:11] <ferreira> @values.sort: ( { $^h<name> }, {$^h<id> } )    but that would be too much (I mean, explaining all these in a light article on <=>, leg and cmp)

[14:11] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[14:17] <Juerd> ferreira: Maybe "returns that 0 is before 1"

[14:18] <Juerd> ferreira: Maybe explain cmp more, like that it does numbers, strings, and objects

[15:08] <avar> fglock: isn't there some abstraction for {_value}->{_array} and {_hash} in the p5 runtime?

[15:09] <fglock> avar: not sure what you mean, that's the low-level representation

[15:11] <avar> just wondering why it wasn't say ::DISPATCH($foo, "array")

[15:11] *** cmarcelo left
[15:11] <avar> Just wondering how best to implement stuff like ' ( @{ ' ~ $cond.emit_perl5 ~ '->{_value}{_array} } )' in CL

[15:11] <pmurias> avar you want to get to p5landish value

[15:11] *** drrho left
[15:12] <fglock> ::DISPATCH($foo, "array") works, but it returns an Array object; you need {_array}  (or p5landish) to get to the p5 data

[15:12] <pmurias> i get it its perl->cl

[15:13] <pmurias> fglock: what tests are supposed to fail?

[15:14] <avar> so stuff like ' ( ' ( @{ ' ~ $cond.emit_perl5 ~ '->{_value}{_array} } )'@{ ' ~ $cond.emit_perl5 ~ '->{_value}{_array} } )' can be abstracted but the EmitPerl5 emitter is just peeking at internals since it's old code?:)
