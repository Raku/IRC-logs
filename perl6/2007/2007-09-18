[10:50] <moritz_> ahmadz: yes

[10:50] <ahmadz> cool

[10:50] <ahmadz> moritz_: what's ur browser/os?

[10:50] <moritz_> I just used firebug, and it shows an empty line in the "POST" tab

[10:50] <ahmadz> ff2/linux?

[10:50] <moritz_> iceweasel 2.0 (unbranded firefox for debian) on debian

[10:51] <ahmadz> try ctrl-f5 [to refresh cache]

[10:52] <moritz_> doesn't make a difference

[10:52] <moritz_> I used ctrl+shift+r before

[10:53] <ahmadz> ok, it works on ff2 win; i need to try it on ff2/linux then

[10:54] <ahmadz> the good thing it worked on safari/win32

[10:54] <moritz_> is it normal that the requests (or some of them) are sent to runpugs3.pl?

[10:55] <ahmadz> no they shouldnt...

[10:55] <ahmadz> what's the address you're using again?

[10:55] <moritz_> http://feather3.perl6.nl/runpugs/

[10:55] <lambdabot> Title: Run Perl 6 Now -- in your browser!

[10:56] <moritz_> is there anything I can do to help you with debugging?

[10:57] <ahmadz> im tracing it... ;-)

[10:58] <ahmadz> moritz_: try http://feather.perl6.nl:8096/runpugs/ plz

[10:58] <lambdabot> Title: Run Perl 6 Now -- in your browser!

[10:59] <moritz_> same result

[11:00] <ahmadz> moritz: cool ;-)

[11:01] <ahmadz> moritz: i guess html escaping is different on FF2/linux in <PRE> tags

[11:01] <moritz_> ahmadz: I guess it's a problem with the input method

[11:01] <moritz_> ahmadz: on my german keyboard I have to type AltGr+q to produce an @ sign

[11:01] <ahmadz> moritz_: aha cool... we're getting somewhere

[11:02] <moritz_> a simple <foo bar>.say works

[11:02] <moritz_> as expected

[11:02] <ahmadz> moritz: try this link: http://people.w3.org/rishida/utils/keyevents/

[11:02] <lambdabot> Title: ishida utilities >> Key event monitor

[11:03] <moritz_> it produces a keydown 0 first

[11:03] <moritz_> and then a keyup 50

[11:03] <ahmadz> on a '<' ?

[11:04] <moritz_> no, on AltGr+q (which produces @)

[11:04] <moritz_> the < and > work for me

[11:04] <moritz_> the @ sign seems to be the problem

[11:04] <theorbtwo> It's been my experince that german keymaps are very annoying to code with (in general and across most languages).

[11:04] <fglock_> i'm reading http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000157.html and related articles (re: lazy gather/take)

[11:04] <lambdabot> Title: Squawks of the Parrot: Continuations and VMs, part 2

[11:05] <moritz_> theorbtwo: they are, yes

[11:05] <theorbtwo> That kevents thingy gets very confused by my compose key, BTW.

[11:05] <moritz_> ahmadz: maybe just try to strip 0 bytes from the strings before sending them to the server?

[11:06] <ahmadz> moritz_: so you enter "my @a = <foo 1 2 3>"

[11:06] <ahmadz> moritz_: and you see it echo-ed again as my @  = <foo 1 2 3>?

[11:06] <ahmadz> moritz: srry without the @

[11:07] <moritz_> ahmadz: no, it is echoed as "pugs my\n...>"

[11:08] <ahmadz> moritz_: oh, ok then

[11:09] <moritz_> also copy&paste doesn't work in the console window

[11:09] *** iblechbot left
[11:10] <ahmadz> moritz_: im doing keydown/keyup javascript handling... so that's expected... home/del/left/right/up/down should work

[11:11] <moritz_> ahmadz: they do

[11:11] <ahmadz> moritz_: cool

[11:12] <moritz_> so it's most likely a combined weirdness of my german keyboard and javascript event handlers

[11:12] <ahmadz> we can debug it if you have the time

[11:14] <moritz_> mabe later today, now I have to get some food ;)

[11:15] <ahmadz> moritz_: cool ty for your time

[11:15] <ahmadz> moritz_: one more thing, i was looking at your evalbot.pl code for possible re-use of kp6 into runpugs

[11:16] <moritz_> it's rather simplistic, not a REPL loop

[11:16] <ahmadz> moritz_: but the thing is we need the process to be running all the time in a REPL fashion like pugs

[11:17] <ahmadz> moritz_: then i should focus next on the tutorial part and maybe debug your german keyboard problem later in the night... ty for your time... enjoy ur food ;-)

[11:18] <moritz_> ahmadz: thank you, and see you later

[13:31] * K0brik ponders about a GTK perl6 debugger

[13:31] <moritz_> write one!

[13:32] <avar> well, there's a gtk perl5 debugger...

[13:32] <K0brik> good idea

[13:32] <moritz_> if you want to commit access to the pugs repository, just /msg me your email adress and desired nick name

[13:32] <K0brik> avar: whats the name?

[13:32] <avar> K0brik: emacs 22

[13:32] <moritz_> lol

[13:32] <K0brik> damn. I though emacs had lots of problems even with perl highlighting

[13:33] <jrockway> fuck no

[13:33] <avar> no, it's the best perl highlighter

[13:33] <jrockway> emacs has the best perl mode of anything else i've seen

[13:33] <K0brik> avar: what mode do you use cperl?

[13:33] <avar> yeah, cperl-mode

[13:33] <jrockway> i am planning on porting angerwhale to elisp just so i can highlight my posts the same as emacs :)

[13:33] <K0brik> cperl-mode is screwing my code

[13:33] <jrockway> how?

[13:34] <moritz_> jrockway: wyh don't you just write Text::EmacsColor?

[13:34] <K0brik> the auto indentation

[13:34] <moritz_> jrockway: in analogy to Text::VimColor

[13:34] <jrockway> K0brik: don't use it then

[13:34] <jrockway> moritz_: yeah

[13:34] <jrockway> moritz_: if you thought vimcolor was slow, wait until you see emacscolor :)

[13:34] <moritz_> jrockway: then use PPI::HTML ;)

[13:35] <jrockway> yes, that's a good idea

[13:35] <moritz_> jrockway: I wrote a offline CMS which uses vimcolor for syntax hilighting

[13:35] <moritz_> jrockway: because I couldn't find another hilighter for perl 6 code

[13:35] <moritz_> and I wanted syntax hilighting so badly for http://perl-6.de/

[13:35] <lambdabot> Title: Perl 6 - Schmerzloses Programmieren

[13:35] <jrockway> http://www.kentcowgill.org/blog/view/133

[13:35] <lambdabot> Title: Too slow - kentcowgill.org/blog

[13:36] <moritz_> jrockway: caching, caching, caching

[13:36] <moritz_> I think it's acceptable to slow on posting

[13:36] <moritz_> that happens just every once in a while

[13:36] <jrockway> i use Syntax::Higligh::Engine::Kate

[13:36] <jrockway> but it's slow, and i cache too :)

[13:37] <moritz_> or you can even let the server side script fork into the background to do the hilighting progressively

[13:37] <jrockway> angerwhale is mostly static, it only recalculates pages when they change

[13:37] <jrockway> the real reason i haven't written emacscolor is that i don't know how

[13:37] <jrockway> maybe exec emacs and have it print out its internal representation of the buffer

[13:37] * jrockway delegates to avar for that

[13:37] <moritz_> jrockway: another idea... use a MAD enabled blead perl and parse its XML output

[13:38] <moritz_> then you get correct output - always ;)

[13:38] <jrockway> emacs actually does a little better than MAD, it highlights inside regexes too

[13:39] <moritz_> I didn't know that MAD doesn't handle regexes

[13:39] <moritz_> jrockway: but it doesn't execute BEGIN blocks ;)

[13:39] <jrockway> i think it just dumps them as a string

[13:39] <jrockway> i haven't looked for a while though, so i could be completely wrong

[13:40] <jrockway> code that i post to my blog doesn't use BEGIN to affect compiliation anyway :)

[13:40] <avar> yes and the mad xml isn't very useful for most things, it's not an AST

[13:40] <moritz_> :)

[13:40] <jrockway> anyway, to get back on topic

[13:40] <moritz_> avar: is it sufficient for syntax hilighting?

[13:40] <jrockway> cperl lets you customize indentation

[13:40] <jrockway> although i still haven't gotten it right in one place, and just press "C-u SPACE" in that situation

[13:40] <avar> moritz_: it would be very painful

[13:42] <jrockway> also

[13:42] <jrockway> long time no see, avar

[13:42] <jrockway> how is #perl these days?

[15:25] <lambdabot> pmurias: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[15:26] <fglock_> avar: nice - thanks for working on it :)

[15:27] <avar> fglock_: Is the -mp6- stuff going to be kept around?

[15:27] *** barney joined
[15:27] <fglock_> yes, it doesn't bootstrap yet

[15:28] <avar> is that going to happen any time soon?

[15:28] <avar> I'm wondering how to make kp6 installable

[15:29] <moritz_> avar: you don't need the mp6 stuff at run time

[15:29] <moritz_> avar: so for non-cpan usage you can just compile it to perl 5

[15:29] <fglock_> it is possible to install the kp6-mp6 version for now, and switch when it bootstraps

[15:29] <avar> might need lib-modules-kp6-mp6-p5

[15:30] <avar> but anyway, I think it's best to have blib look like blib/lib/KindaPerl6/kp6-mp6-p5/{modules,lib}/, what do you think? That would make room for multiple emitter backends

[15:30] *** TJCRI joined
[15:31] <avar> then the frontends could look for KindaPerl6/$something/lib/ in @INC

[15:31] <fglock_> it makes sense to me

[15:35] <avar> make forcerecompile all fails b.t.w.

[15:36] *** pdcawley left
[15:36] <pmurias> fglock_: any thoughts how context wars could be implemented, they might be usefull for example gather

[15:37] <pmurias> * for gather

[15:37] <pmurias> i'm thinking of PadWalker

[15:37] <pmurias> but it's a additional dependenciy

[15:37] <fglock_> pmurias: either by asking the Pad object, or PadWalker - I'd rather use Pad, because it's more portable

[15:38] <pmurias> * dependency

[15:38] <fglock_> i think gather doesn't need it

[15:38] <pmurias> one could use a local

[15:38] <fglock_> i'm planning to use coroutines for lazy gather

[15:39] <fglock_>  $ perl examples/coro.pl

[15:39] <fglock_> i'm trying out a visitor to implement that

[15:39] <pmurias> is gathers laziness speced somewhere?

[15:40] <moritz_> I think implicitly "all lists are lazy"

[15:40] <fglock_> looking

[15:41] <PerlJam> all lists are lazy is specced, so I'd call that "explicit"  :)

[15:41] <PerlJam> (unless you've marked them otherwise)

[15:41] <pmurias> List context in Perl 6 is by default lazy.

[15:42] <pmurias> S02

[16:55] <ahmadz> hi all

[16:55] <TimToady> fglock_: note that gather/take is currently specced as dynamically scoped, not lexically.  I wonder whether coro can handle a take in different sub than its gather.

[16:56] <TimToady> ahmadz: hi

[16:56] *** weinig joined
[16:57] <moritz_> TimToady: do you think custom ternary (or n-ary) operators should be possible?

[16:57] <moritz_> is that possible with STD's approach?

[16:58] <moritz_> I'm refering to http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=639643

[16:58] <lambdabot> Title: &#91;Perl 6&#93; Even more freedom for custom operators?

[16:59] <fglock_> yes, i'm handling that case - but what i'm calling "coro" not be the same thing

[16:59] <TimToady> well, anything is possible.  the current bottom-up parser is just a method, after all

[17:00] <fglock_> may not be

[17:00] <TimToady> k

[17:00] *** justatheory joined
[17:00] <fglock_> i wonder if you had a specific implementation strategy in mind?

[17:01] <TimToady> not really

[17:02] <moritz_> TimToady: ok, let's rephrase it: it is feasible without too much change to existing STD?

[17:02] <TimToady> gather/take is just a way to hide continuations inside list context, theoretically

[17:02] <TimToady> define "too much"

[17:02] <TimToady> method EXPR does 1-token lookahead

[17:02] <moritz_> too much = change at least 30% of existing code in STD

[17:03] <TimToady> you could write an EXPR that does multi-token lookahead

[17:03] <TimToady> and it would be roughly the same size as the current EXPR method

[17:03] *** ferreira joined
[17:03] <moritz_> but it would impose a performance overhead, right?

[17:04] <TimToady> the primary difficulty is not performance, it's explaining to mere mortals why it isn't doing simple operator precedence anymore :)

[17:04] <moritz_> ok, that answers my question, thank you ;)

[17:04] <TimToady> it makes it a lot hard to answer "What went wrong with my program?"

[17:16] <TimToady> well, a yield has to know where it's sending its value somehow

[18:27] <TimToady> ferreira: "'.' was after a few years of OO practice the operator by excellence to join..." is not really English

[18:27] <Juerd> Ah. I think I've never seen a .jo hostname before!

[18:27] <ahmadz> juerd: ;-)

[18:28] <TimToady> did you mean "the operator of choice"?

[18:30] <ferreira> yes, makes sense. I use to write a few silly things in English because I try not to think in my own language. And then I think for a moment and it seems like I am not thinking at all.

[18:31] <TimToady> also "after a few years of OO practice" sounds like "after a few rounds of golf practice"

[18:31] <TimToady> that is, it sounds like you're doing the practicing, not the industry

[18:32] <TimToady> perhaps the phrase "common practice" could be used

[18:32] *** dduncan joined
[18:34] <ferreira> Replaced 'OO practice' by 'common practice'. It improved.

[18:36] <ferreira> Sometimes I insist on some expressions, like the 'OO' in this case, and then I discover it doesn't add much.

[18:39] *** pmurias left
[18:41] <TimToady> well, "common OO practice" would work fine too

[18:41] *** c9s left
[18:43] <TimToady> one other thing, I usually use Perl&nbsp;6 just to avoid line breaks in the middle

[18:44] <ferreira> ok. How do I say that in POD6: E<nbsp> ?

[18:46] *** rindolf left
[18:47] <ferreira> Yes, that works. I will need to tame perldoc2xhtml (the XHTML producer of Perl6::Perldoc) to produce the HTML without line breaks in paragraphs, to keep MT happy (that's what ONLamp uses).

[19:16] <ferreira> Well, I learned a bit of POD6 today. It seems nice. I will think about at an extension define for example a macro inline code. That would make possible to write M<Perl 6> that rendered as PerlE<nbsp>6.

[19:30] <ferreira> It seems like I spoke too soon about learning something about POD6. Strangely, perlpod2xhtml is translating S<Perl 6> into bizarre "&nbsp;P&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;l&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp;"

[19:34] <ferreira> Funny. Damian got bit by x modifier: " $text =~ s{ }{&nbsp;}gxms; " should have been " $text =~ s{[ ]}{&nbsp;}gxms; "

[19:35] <avar> shouldn't have used /x at all

[19:36] <avar> and ms? 

[19:36] <ferreira> but his rule is to always use /gxms, so what he should have not forgotten is [ ] to make space explicit

[19:37] <ferreira> s| to always use /gxms | to always use /xms |

[19:38] <ferreira> the /g was to get a global substitution

[19:39] <avar> always use /gxms? is that one of his retarded best practices? *ducks*

[19:40] <ferreira> yep. These practices made into Perl 6 as well. /x is no longer necessary, because it is the default. (Use rx:perl5// or something to get the old behavior)

[19:41] *** ferreira left
[19:41] <avar> Yes, but why would you want /s AND /m ?

[19:41] *** justatheory left
[19:41] <PerlJam> sado masochism.

[19:42] <TimToady> in p6 /s is default but not /m

[19:42] <TimToady> that is, . always matches anything, but ^ and $ are still beg/end of the entire string

[19:43] *** ferreira joined
[19:43] <TimToady> and they are no longer switched lexically.  use \N or ^^ or $$ explicitly to get the other behavior

[19:43] <avar> well that's because p6 ^ and $ != p5 ^ and $, and ^^ and $$ = \A and \z

[19:43] <[particle]> perl 6 regexes are sadistic by default, but no longer masochistic

[19:43] <avar> :)

[19:44] <PerlJam> perl 6 regex is *much* saner by default.

[19:44] *** rff_ joined
[19:44] <PerlJam> *much* *saner*

[19:45] <TimToady> avar: no, you've got ^^ and $$ backwards

[19:45] <TimToady> \A and \z are ^ and $

[19:45] <avar> yeah, seems like it:)

[19:46] <avar> But when is /sm in p5 not the same thing as /s ?

[19:46] <TimToady> mnemonic: ^^ and $$ can match multiple times in the same string

[19:46] <TimToady> they're entirely independent

[19:46] <TimToady> the /s merely changes the meaning of ., while the /m merely changes the meaning of ^ and $

[19:47] <TimToady> they're only related by both usages being correlated to having a string with multiple lines in it

[19:48] <TimToady> part of why Damian's BP on that is bogus is that /^foo/ can be optimized much better than /^foo/m can

[19:49] <TimToady> and, in fact, that's why the default is the way it is in p5

[19:52] <PerlJam> "faster"?  I don't think the bottleneck is in getting the text to Damian, but rather getting the Damian to process it and respond.
