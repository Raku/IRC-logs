[16:38] <aaron_TeeJay> anybody know what I have to do in order for http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/30/0912211 to work?

[16:38] <lambdabot> Title: use Perl | Want a perl6 Binary?

[16:39] <aaron_TeeJay> i.e. a working perl 6 compiler executable I can use to run perl 6 scripts?

[16:41] <aaron_TeeJay> from 5.1 release

[16:44] <aaron_TeeJay> anybody care to point me at the long way round of being able to run perl 6 code using parrot and perl6/nqp? (using 5.1 release)

[16:48] <allbery_b> this channel is kinda light on parrot expertise.  try #parrot on magnet?

[16:48] <allbery_b> (irc.perl.org/#parrot)

[16:49] <aaron_TeeJay> allbery_b, yes doing that too

[16:49] <aaron_TeeJay> I kinda guessed, that,  you know, actually running perl 6 code might be on topic here ;)

[16:50] <allbery_b> the problem there being that p6 != p6 :) this channel is primarily about pugs

[16:50] <aaron_TeeJay> but yes - got the answer from #parrot :)

[16:50] <aaron_TeeJay> right....

[16:51] <allbery_b> (it's a pity it's not called #pugs given its focus, really)

[16:51] <aaron_TeeJay> glad to see that perl 6 resources aren't still terribly confusing

[16:51] <aaron_TeeJay> ;)

[17:22] <pmurias> allbery_b: there isn't much pugs oriented discussion here so it definitly shouldn't be called #pugs

[17:23] <allbery_b> yeh, after I sent that I thoght that it's really mre about kp6 now.  otoh kp6 lives in the pugs repo

[17:42] <pugs_svn> r19293 | pmurias++ | [kp6-v6] more infix operators, wraping everythin in sub {...}->() so binding will work outside of subroutines

[17:42] <aaron_TeeJay> allbery_b, :)

[17:42] <aaron_TeeJay> we could do with a perl6-users channel tho :)

[17:51] <pmurias> aaron_TeeJay: to the perl6 users want to seperate themself?
