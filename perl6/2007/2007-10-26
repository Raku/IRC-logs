[07:58] *** BinGOs joined
[08:25] <moritz_> are coroutines (with yield instead of return) and gather/take isomorphic?

[08:37] <moritz_> assuming lazy gather/take, that is

[08:39] *** riffraff left
[08:39] <spinclad> hmm.  i suspect coroutines will be more general, as not constrained to a producer/consumer assymetry, but i'm not sure Perl 6 coroutines, in particular, have all the power i'm thinking of.

[08:43] <spinclad> certainly every yield point has a signature of what is yielded there, both on the calling side (yield ...) and the receiving side (... := coroutine(...));

[08:45] <moritz_> ah right, yield can probably propagate a different context than take

[08:45] <spinclad> and as i have understood coroutines, a signature back when the receiving side asks it to go on.

[08:45] *** drrho joined
[08:47] <spinclad> the simplest case keeps these signatures fixed for the life of the coroutining pair; but with careful architecture this needn't be the case, and perhaps usefully so.

[08:48] <spinclad> iow, you could have sets A and B of yield points that have different interfaces; but they would have to stay in sync on both sides.

[08:51] <spinclad> i wouldn't be surprised if this could be better expressed another way, though.

[08:52] <spinclad> say, as a persistent object with two different methods.

[08:52] *** drrho left
[08:53] *** jisom left
[08:55] <spinclad> well, back to thrashing, and bed.  g'night, @all

[09:09] *** renormalist joined
[09:11] *** devogon joined
[09:20] <TimToady> I don't think they're isomorphic.  coroutines are limited to returning from the current "sub", while a take can return from any gather in the outer dynamic scope.

[09:22] <TimToady> though, as with loop controls, it should probably prefer a visible outer lexical scope over a hidden dynamic scope, even if the dynamic scope is inside the lexically scoped gather

[09:24] <TimToady> that is, it should probably search for a gather by the same policy as S04:807

[09:25] <TimToady> (and thereabouts)

[09:25] <moritz_> TimToady: thanks

[09:26] <TimToady> and could even potentially have labelled gathers, and FOO.take()

[10:35] <pmurias> *emitters

[10:36] <fglock> pmurias: yes

[10:36] <fglock> because the AST is an mp6 object

[10:37] *** ingy left
[10:37] <TimToady> note, I just changed the precedence of x, xx and ~

[10:38] *** gugod joined
[10:38] *** ingy joined
[10:39] <TimToady> also, to get my fixed pugs compile perl5_init had to refer to &environ rather than &env.  this might break the build elsewhere...

[10:39] <fglock> TimToady: is it ok to refactor the regex AST to avoid left-recursion?

[10:39] <TimToady> where does it do left-recursion?

[10:40] <fglock> I mean, to allow left recursion, without infinite loop

[10:42] <TimToady> why would you need it?

[10:42] <TimToady> everything calls a lower rule, except things that have some other token on the left

[10:43] <pmurias> you want to turn token left {<left> <something>} into token {<something>+}

[10:43] <pmurias> ?

[10:43] <fglock> yes, for example

[10:44] <pmurias> isn't the later clearer

[10:44] <pmurias> ?

[10:47] <fglock> hmm - I need it a while ago, it would make some grammar simpler to write - I'll try to find it

[10:47] <fglock> needed

[10:48] <TimToady> it tends to completely screw up longest-token matching

[10:50] <pmurias> fglock: fixing $foo.bar.baz?

[10:52] <fglock> pmurias: that would be one case, but it is should probably be fixed with some precedence algorithm, for flexibility

[10:53] <fglock> reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion

[10:53] <lambdabot> Title: Left recursion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[10:55] <TimToady> re-zzz &

[10:56] <pmurias> fglock: left recursion is hard to understand with a NFA mindset

[11:01] <fglock> hmm - mindsets make certain things harder to understand

[11:07] <pmurias> fglock: and somethings easy, luckily you aren't limited to one

[11:07] <fglock> reading on NFA too

[11:12] * pmurias got confused is the perl regex engine an NFA?

[11:18] <fglock> I read that Perl 5.10 optimizes snippets to [DN]FA when possible

[11:20] <pmurias> i think it is (without the nonregular features) with backtracking being transitons withought taking any input

[11:21] <avar> fglock: it doesn't

[11:23] <pmurias> would a perl build script be better than a Makefile?

[11:24] *** iblechbot left
[11:25] <avar> something that could run on all makes would be a good start

[11:25] <avar> but if you're going to write it in pure-perl it'll be troublesome to write and to get it to work with makemaker

[11:29] <pmurias> avar: is Module::Build an option?

[11:30] <avar> why do you want to use that?

[11:31] <pmurias> just looking at it, it dosn't use make at all

[11:31] <avar> people generally seem to dislike it

[11:32] <avar> anyway depending on make isn't a problem, but depending on GNU make is

[11:32] <avar> you could write perl code in the .PL file to do the patsubst thing and /%.pm

[11:33] <pmurias> dlocaus++ wrote it

[11:35] <pmurias> avar: but the whole Makefile.PL feels hackish

[11:51] <avar> pmurias: I just know it routinely breaks my cpan installs by opening dialogs during make test or something

[11:52] <avar> because it insists on not installing things in the normal perl module tree or something

[11:55] <fglock> how about to add the AST to the 'Code' object, to allow serialization?

[11:55] <pmurias> sounds resonable

[11:56] <fglock>  &print.perl would just return "&print" ?

[11:57] <pmurias> fglock: or 'sub {...}'

[11:57] <fglock> pmurias: "&print" can be eval'ed back

[16:20] <bbkr> i wrote card 'war' game simulation (code at http://bbkr.org/~bbkr/card_war_game.pl) that shows some PERL6 features. do you think it's worth adding to examples?

[16:21] <[particle]> sure!

[16:22] <avar> bbkr: s/uniq operator/uniq method/

[16:23] <bbkr> ok

[16:24] <[particle]> p5 question: can a block have multiple labels?

[16:24] <avar> yes

[16:25] <[particle]> what's the syntax? foo: bar: {...} ?

[16:25] <avar> yes

[16:25] <avar> blocks don't have labels, you can put them everywhere you put a statement

[16:25] <[particle]> c:\usr\local\ack>perl -e"foo: bar: { 1 }"

[16:25] <[particle]> syntax error at -e line 1, near "foo: bar:"

[16:26] <avar> $ perl -wle 'loop: 1; loop_two: for (1..2) {}'

[16:26] <avar> urgh

[16:26] <avar> sh-3.1$ perl -wle 'loop: 1; loop_two: for (1..2) { last loop}'

[16:26] <avar> Label not found for "last loop" at -e line 1.

[16:26] <avar> sh-3.1$ perl -wle 'loop: 1; loop_two: for (1..2) { last loop_two }'

[16:26] <avar> sh-3.1$

[16:26] <avar> I'm wrong apperently

[16:26] * avar thinking in C

[16:27] <[particle]> yeah, i'm used to c labelling too :(

[16:27] <funktio> $ perl -le 'outer: { inner: for (1..2) { print } }'

[16:27] <[particle]> i guess that's what i'll have to do. funktio++

[16:28] <avar> loop: do {{ loop_two: for (1..2) { last loop } }} <= I think this works

[16:29] <funktio> avar: Label not found for "last loop" at -e line 1.

[16:29] <[particle]> yeah, do doesn't take labels

[16:29] <[particle]> you can't use next or last inside do

[16:29] *** justatheory joined
[16:30] *** justatheory left
[16:30] <avar> you can if you have a do with two brackets

[16:31] <avar> do {{ last }}

[16:32] <funktio> interesting

[16:32] <[particle]> i guess then you'd need do { label: { last label } }

[16:32] <funktio> yeah, it's last()ing the bare block, not do
