[00:02] *** Jmax joined
[00:04] <obra> I have a question for folks interested in hacking on docs

[00:04] <obra> anyone around?

[00:04] * moritz 

[00:05] <moritz> I like to form heavy objects out of printed docs and hack on my screen with them ;)

[00:05] <obra> moritz: ORA's book on perl6 and parrot has just been opensourced. (perl6 and parrot essentials)

[00:05] <obra> we now have the source under Artistic 2

[00:05] <obra> if it got checked into the pugs rep, would folks be interested in modernizing, updating and extending it?

[00:06] <moritz> obra: I read that mail, and I replied, but it didn't get through to the list

[00:06] <obra> moritz: allison and I have been having an olff-list tchat

[00:06] <obra> what was the summary of your mail?

[00:06] <moritz> 1) sounds good

[00:07] <moritz> 2) does the TPF already has a license for it?

[00:07] <obra> Artistic 2

[00:07] <moritz> 3) I'd suggest the pugs repo instead the "official" perl one, because it's open to more hackers

[00:07] <moritz> just sent it again, with a different SMTP this time

[00:08] <obra> What I talked allison into is initial commit to tpf repo then branching to the pugs repo

[00:09] <nothingmuch> wiki!

[00:09] <moritz> nothingmuch: no!

[00:09] <Tene> wiki--

[00:09] <moritz> nothingmuch: I can't use vim in a wiki

[00:09] <nothingmuch> don't you wnat pictures of pretty girls in the next edition of the book?

[00:09] <moritz> nothingmuch: and it has a much longer dev cycle

[00:09] <nothingmuch> and a 404 link chapter?

[00:09] <Tene> moritz: you can with proper browser plugins

[00:09] <Tene> or with a fuse app for that wiki

[00:09] <moritz> Tene: but that's an evil hack

[00:10] <nothingmuch> well, there is a possibility for middle ground

[00:10] <moritz> if you want something wiki-like, use a distributed SCM

[00:10] <nothingmuch> e.g. ingy's doolitle

[00:10] <nothingmuch> which is essentially a wiki frontend to a bunch of perldocs in svn

[00:10] <nothingmuch> but i was kidding

[00:10] <Tene> moritz: nah, the pugs crowd seems to love SVN

[00:10] <moritz> Tene: I wouldn't mind switching to git ;)

[00:11] * Tene likes git.

[00:12] <nothingmuch> darcs

[00:12] <nothingmuch> yay!

[00:12] * nothingmuch stops trolling

[00:12] <moritz> I haven't really tried it, but I heard great things about git... and seen examples, and all

[00:12] <moritz> today I was in git talk at debconf7

[00:12] <nothingmuch> http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/darcs_osdc/slides/start.html

[00:12] <lambdabot> Title: Darcs

[00:12] <nothingmuch> wait for the images to load, so s5 kicks in

[00:15] <moritz> obra: obviously I'll read parrot+perl6 internals prior to chaniging it ;)

[00:16] <moritz> nothingmuch: what's an advantage of darcs compared to git?

[00:16] <nothingmuch> IMHO darcs is the most user friendly VCS i've seen

[00:16] <nothingmuch> and also very powerful

[00:16] <nothingmuch> the non linearity of changes is what sold me

[00:16] <obra> yeah, when trying to write a book, that's not so hot ;)

[00:17] <nothingmuch> tangetntial

[00:17] <nothingmuch> if you change chapter a and then chapter b, and then change your mind about changing chapter a, darcs makes that trivial

[00:17] <moritz> "n Darcs every working directory is a full repository" - that's an advantage over git

[00:17] <obra> svk has that mode too, moritz. and works with svn ;)

[00:17] <obra> anyway

[00:18] <obra> I don't see pugs switching version control systems this week

[00:18] <nothingmuch> you're just pimping your buddies code ;-)

[00:18] <obra> hence it makes sense to check it into svn and go from there

[00:18] <obra> nothingmuch: mine, actually

[00:18] <nothingmuch> for the record i'm not trying to get pugs on svn, just saying why i like darcs since someone mentioned git =)

[00:18] <nothingmuch> and don't worry, i'm a happy svk user, too

[00:18] <moritz> obra: I know, but git performs a bit better than svk for large repos ;)

[00:19] <nothingmuch> that's where darcs loses

[00:19] <moritz> I don't try either ;)

[00:19] <obra> let's not have this discussion here

[00:19] <obra> it's not perl6 ;)

[00:20] <moritz> obra: that never stopped us from any discussion here ;)

[00:20] <obra> :P

[00:22] <moritz> nothingmuch: nice slides ;)

[00:22] * nothingmuch wonders why his comp is so slow

[00:22] <nothingmuch> everthing is happenning at a 1 sec delay

[00:23] <thoughtpolice> nothingmuch: I agree on the note that darcs is really 'easy'

[00:23] <thoughtpolice> pretty much all of the concepts in darcs are about as straightforward as I've seen, and a lot of them are really useful (cherry picking is one of the best)

[00:25] <thoughtpolice> git is pretty much as good as you'll get for a fast system though; mercurial is pretty quick as well. i haven't tried it, but in pushes and pulls from repo's with very large amounts of patches, some actions can take inordinate amounts of time.

[00:25] <thoughtpolice> which is kind of a downer for darcs

[00:26] <moritz> which is an advantage for us

[00:27] <moritz> because it means hacking GHC is less fun for audreyt as it could be

[00:27] <moritz> => more time for pugs ;)

[00:27] <thoughtpolice> haha

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> well the ghc guys apparently don't like some of the issues. :/ but the new ideas taking place in darcs for the SoC should help out a *lot*

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> i assume that'll be something like darcs 1.1

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> since we have 1.0.9 now. :)

[00:29] <nothingmuch> that's a little problematic

[00:29] <nothingmuch> because it's been in the queue too long

[00:29] <nothingmuch> personally i've never seen the issues with my own two eyes

[00:29] <nothingmuch> but occasionally people bring them up

[00:29] *** amadeus is now known as laye

[00:29] * nothingmuch is very happy with darcs for all of his non work, non catalyst modules

[00:29] <thoughtpolice> i'm pretty happy with it too

[00:30] *** sunnavy joined
[00:30] <thoughtpolice> but then again the ghc guys are probably playing in a pretty different ballpark than you or I are. i can imagine problems like that cropping up in a 100kloc app with thousands upon thousands [upon thousands] of patches

[00:31] <thoughtpolice> for most people though a lot of the actual pointed out issues with darcs aren't really that much of a problem. a lot of them seem to manifest more in much larger projects.

[00:31] <nothingmuch> yep

[00:31] * moritz has an active project that's on revision 7, and at least half a year old

[00:31] <thoughtpolice> nice. :)

[00:31] <nothingmuch> http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/darcs_dep.pdf

[00:31] <nothingmuch> that's probably as big as i've gotten

[00:31] <moritz> since I'm the only developer, there's no need for early commits ;)

[00:33] <thoughtpolice> i'll openly admit that probably none of my projects have had that many. :)

[00:33] <thoughtpolice> most of my code is mainly just little stuff I write in my spare time; repo's that use maybe ~20 or so patches.

[00:34] <thoughtpolice> i love darcs though. mercurial is looking really nice however, so I'm going to have to try it out more extensively sometime in the future.

[00:34] <thoughtpolice> and I've normally found the best way to learn something is to use it; I'll have to find some kind of project to hack on. :)

[00:35] <moritz> thoughtpolice: pugs ;)

[00:36] <moritz> thoughtpolice: did you apply for a microgrant?

[00:36] <thoughtpolice> no. right now I'm trying to clear up some other loose ended projects I have

[00:37] <thoughtpolice> namely ones that have taken inordinate amount of time which I'm not very happy about. a few I can lay off since they're a bit more personal, but there're a couple that've been really nagging on my brain recently that I need to take care of

[00:37] <thoughtpolice> but the recommendation for a microgrant has been on my mind over the past few days. :)

[00:38] <thoughtpolice> mainly there're about 2 projects I need to work more on. once those are done a microgrant is high up there as something to shoot for. :)

[00:39] <thoughtpolice> the funny thing is both of these things are websites. what're they both waiting on? designs. *sigh*

[00:39] <moritz> thoughtpolice: for designs I just go to oswd.org most of the time ;)

[00:39] <moritz> thoughtpolice: take a good looking design, and modify it to my needs

[00:39] <thoughtpolice> although I think I found a nice web framework that I could use

[00:39] <thoughtpolice> web.py

[00:39] <thoughtpolice> moritz: thanks. :)

[00:41] <thoughtpolice> moritz: one of those is probably good for my blog. the other one is a more domain-specific site, so I have a designer working on it specifically right now (at least, I think...)

[00:41] <moritz> ok

[00:41] <moritz> and I wrote my own little offline CMS in perl ;)

[00:42] <thoughtpolice> ah, fun stuff. :)

[00:42] <moritz> it basically handles inclues, variable substitutions and a special menu system for nested menus

[00:42] <moritz> and it can syntax hilight through Text::VimColor

[00:43] <moritz> which means it can even hilight perl 6 code decently! ;-)

[00:43] <thoughtpolice> awesome

[00:43] <thoughtpolice> :)

[00:44] <moritz> that wasn't really hard to implement, but a killer feature for http://perl-6.de/

[05:21] <weirdo> heya

[05:21] <weirdo> are strings, arrays et al subclasses of a common type

[05:46] *** rfordinal joined
[05:52] <dduncan> weirdo, yes

[05:52] <gaal> weirdo: look for "buffer" in L<S09/"Compact arrays">

[05:53] <gaal> you can coerce a string into a buf

[05:53] <gaal> shower &

[05:53] <dduncan> all types are subtypes of Object

[05:53] <weirdo> thanks

[05:53] <weirdo> but can't i map{} over a string?

[05:53] *** rfordinal joined
[05:53] <dduncan> more specifically, they all subtype Any

[05:54] <dduncan> in what way do you want to map over a string?

[05:54] <dduncan> what is a string element in this case?

[05:54] <weirdo> besides, can i print the type graph in pugs?

[05:55] <dduncan> I don't know about the latter

[05:55] <gaal> weirdo: $obj.perl or $obj.yaml give you textual representations

[05:55] <dduncan> if not now, you probably should be able to soon

[05:55] <weirdo> i was thinking in terms of, all array types (buf, @ary, string etc) working with iterators

[05:56] <gaal> oh, you meant the type graph, not an instance of the type Graph :)

[05:56] <dduncan> a Str is abstract as per what its components are

[05:56] <dduncan> so to do a map{}, you need to specify what level of abstraction you want to work in terms of

[05:56] <dduncan> eg, graphs vs codes vs bytes

[05:57] <dduncan> or vs words et al

[05:57] <dduncan> such as <...> does

[05:58] *** cnhackTNT joined
[05:58] <weirdo> i'm thinking of a string as of an array with each element having the same predefined type

[05:58] <dduncan> which is what?

[05:59] <weirdo> depends whether it's multibyte

[05:59] <dduncan> so you're thinking of a string as being a compact array of something or other?

[06:00] <weirdo> yes

[06:00] <dduncan> what is the context

[06:00] <dduncan> in Perl, a Str is specifically characters, which is an abstract notion

[06:00] <dduncan> whereas a Blob is a string of bits

[06:01] <dduncan> and a buffer is a mutable version of either

[06:01] *** buubot joined
[06:01] <dduncan> in Perl 6, you may simply want to use an array of int or something

[06:01] <dduncan> lower-case int means compact storage

[06:02] <dduncan> as it is machine native int

[06:02] <dduncan> or substitute int for some other lower-case named types

[06:02] <dduncan> or the best answer for you depends on what you actually want to achieve

[06:02] <dduncan> Perl 6 isn't exactly the same as any other language, though has close analogies

[06:03] <dduncan> eg, the C way of doing things may not be directly applicable here

[06:03] <weirdo> i was thinking in terms of common lisp's type system

[06:03] <dduncan> some fundamental concepts differ

[06:03] <dduncan> a Str in perl is fundamentally a scalar, not a collection

[06:03] <weirdo> there are sequences, vectors (compact or not), lists and arrays (multidimensional or vectors)

[06:03] <dduncan> map{} only makes sense over collections

[06:04] <weirdo> thanks. that makes sense

[06:04] <dduncan> you can derive a collection from a scalar, but a scalar is not a collection itself

[06:04] <dduncan> eg, using split() on a Str can give you a collection

[06:05] <dduncan> or various other functions

[06:05] <dduncan> depending on how you want it broken up

[06:05] <weirdo> are there any specifications on macros so far?

[06:05] *** rfordinal joined
[06:05] <dduncan> see Synopsis 6 I think

[06:05] <dduncan> do you know a url for that?

[06:05] <dduncan> if not, see http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html

[06:06] <weirdo> thanks :)

[06:06] <Aankhen``> (spec.pugscode.org)++

[06:07] <dduncan> in Synopsis 6, scroll about 80% of the way down for most Macros stuff

[06:08] <dduncan> note: it would probably be useful for the htmlized Synopsis docs to have generated tables of contents like search.cpan.org does for most pod

[06:13] *** Azur1 joined
[06:13] *** Azur1 left
[06:14] <weirdo> there's something unclear about macros. 'is parsed' implies that macro params are a string. can i get macro params as a syntax tree?

[06:15] <gaal> look for 'quoting' and 'quasiquoting

[06:15] <gaal> '

[06:18] <weirdo> can i use quasiquoting for getting an AST or only for returning it?

[06:19] <weirdo> i was thinking of getting a block passed as a param to macro and seeing its expressions as an array

[06:20] <gaal> should be possible

[06:24] <weirdo> please, show me. most i could do is pugs> macro foo ($foo is CODE) { warn $foo; undef }

[06:25] <weirdo> pugs> foo { 1 + 2; 3 + 4 }

[06:25] <weirdo> *** <SubBlock(<anon>)> at <interactive> line 1, column 28-37

[06:25] <weirdo> undef

[06:25] <weirdo> oops. sorry for the flooding

[06:25] <weirdo> i can't delve into the sub and mess with its expressions

[06:26] <bsb> weirdo: I don't think pugs has all the quasiquoting and macro stuff implemented yet

[07:26] <Tene> Aankhen``: howso, exactly?

[07:26] <jql> well, Parsec is a damn impressive library

[07:27] <Aankhen``> Well, Perl always seems to embrace side-effects, whereas Haskell eschews them entirely (leaving aside monads, needless to say).

[07:27] <Aankhen``> Just funny to see the Perl approach built on top of the Haskell approach, I guess.

[16:06] <thoughtpolice> although admittingly it could go much farther but hey, you only have one line

[16:09] <thoughtpolice> of course in most imperative languages you could just write that as "42" I guess since you can't play with infinte lists, but, uh... yeah.

[20:45] <ibrown> interesting. so from what i read, pug is just a new interpreter to parse the v6 syntax?  and that interpreter can interpret v5 syntax as well or am i incorrect?

[20:47] <fglock> ibrown: that's correct, from the user point of view

[22:35] <TimToady_> I've removed some of them already

[22:35] <moritz> TimToady_: ok

[22:36] <TimToady_> I'm about done with ch04 for the day

[22:37] <TimToady_> not sure what to do about the earlier history-in-progress chapters

[22:37] <moritz> I won't do more today either

[22:37] <moritz> perhaps tomorrow

[22:37] <TimToady_> when it says "so-and-so is currently doing this" and they aren't anymore, it seems odd...

[22:38] <TimToady_> so I think the history parts have to be put into past tense

[23:17] <thoughtpolice> well, lambdabot summed it up pretty nicely I guess

[23:17] <japhb> Don't like Deadwood?

[23:17] <thoughtpolice> deadwood's a good show.

[23:17] <moritz> ch07 will need some good portions of rewriting I guess

[23:18] <japhb> Agreed! One of my favorites.  I meant, that's what it says about the Ruby guy who made the change.  :-)

[23:18] <thoughtpolice> :)

[23:18] <japhb> You'd be hard pressed to enjoy Deadwood and have sensitive ears.  :-)

[23:19] <thoughtpolice> i dunno. either that or for some -- crazy -- reason 'cocksucker' was not a critical part of the unit tests.

[23:21] <japhb> That show is the only time I've ever heard "San Francisco cocksucker!" and *knew* it had absolutely nothing to do with sex.

[23:22] <moritz> time for some serious sleeping for me ;-)

[23:36] <ibrown> i'm pretty mad impressed.  but i guess, there's one question the webpages haven't really answered as of yet.  what are contribs being asked to do to contrib?

[23:44] <TimToady> just find a spot to grab onto the breadcrumb and push it toward the nest.

[23:44] <Aankhen``> gaal: That presentation was great. ^_^

[23:44] <ibrown> I guess the reason I ask is, i use perl every day for system administration tasks.  i'll gladly switch to perl6 and start making comments via: irc: mailing lists instead of using perl5.8 heh.  or if that's unadvisable, i guess i just don't really get a good concept of where you're at from the documentation on the websites.

[23:44] <ibrown> been reading up on it for about 3-5hrs now

[23:45] <ibrown> i use perl5.8 on both win32 and unix platforms

[23:45] <ibrown> i <3 perl on win32 systems for tasks.

[23:46] <TimToady> a lot of the documentation is about where we want to be at, and we don't go out of our way to mark which things are implemented yet, alas.

[23:46] <TimToady> so it's mostly still trial-and-terror at this point

[23:46] <[particle]> we do mark things that have been tested

[23:46] <TimToady> well, yes, that helps

[23:47] <[particle]> spec.pugscode.org

[23:47] <TimToady> but only if they've been smartlinked

[23:50] <japhb> ibrown: Tests can mark what part of the spec they apply to

[23:50] <japhb> So you can look at the spec and know what it tested

[23:51] <japhb> er s/it/is/

[23:55] <lambdabot> Title: S03

[23:56] <japhb> (picked at random, but you'll see what we mean)

[23:58] <japhb> ibrown: Cool and new since the last time I looked at it is that the tests actually have pass/fail info for pugs included!

[23:58] <japhb> (check or x mark)

[23:59] <japhb> I guess the x'es qualify as NIY marks ... it would be nice to have two columns, one for pugs smoke and one for parrot/perl6 smoke.  Though I don't know if the parrot/perl6 people are quite ready for that yet.
