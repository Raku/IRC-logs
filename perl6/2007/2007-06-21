[01:29] <TimToady> I slightly niced audreyt's pugs build processes, so load avg seems to be dropping a bit

[07:24] <Aankhen``> < and > really oughtn't to be matched as part of a URI.

[07:24] <Aankhen``> " and ' probably shouldn't either.

[07:25] <moritz> Aankhen``: I'm not entirely convinced... as soon as somebody constructs an example URL to show somebody how to pass GET parameters to cpan (or something) that will look weird in the logs...

[07:26] <moritz> Aankhen``: but I'll moose about it for a while ;)

[07:26] <Aankhen``> True… it just seemed weird to have URIs broken up by inserting spaces.

[07:27] <moritz> does HTML have any "break-but-not-display"-spaces?

[07:27] <moritz> kind of inverted nobreakspace?

[07:28] <Aankhen``> Unicode has soft hyphens, but the problem is that they're not very well supported in browsers.

[07:28] * moritz hates browsers

[07:28] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[07:29] <moritz> the absence of browser would make web design much more easy ;)

[07:29] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[07:29] <moritz> Aankhen``: I assume you know http://www.i-marco.nl/weblog/images/breakdown.png ?

[07:30] <Aankhen``> ROTFLMAO.

[07:30] <Aankhen``> Very accurate.

[07:30] <Aankhen``> Though I'd take out the "swearing" bit for me, but the rest are fine.

[07:31] <moritz> I can confirm even the swearing ;)

[07:34] <Aankhen``> Hmm.

[07:34] <Aankhen``> moritz: On a tangentially related note, what about using a fixed-width font for the logs? :-)

[07:35] <moritz> Aankhen``: good idea

[07:35] <Aankhen``> May I recommend: font-family: Consolas, "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;

[07:35] <moritz> Aankhen``: you are welcome to add that the CSS file ;)

[07:36] <Aankhen``> (I can't remember the suggested font for Linux, for some reason.)

[07:36] * Aankhen`` gets to it.

[07:36] <moritz> monospace will do on linux ;)

[07:36] <Aankhen``> A'right.

[07:36] <moritz> I like the "verdana bitstream" fonts on linux, there is monospace version of that as well

[07:36] <Aankhen``> Hmm, I don't think that was the one I was thinking of.

[07:37] <Tene> moritz: quite accurate! ;)

[07:38] <moritz> Aankhen``: btw the changes will not appear until I do a 'svn up' on my server, so don't dispair if it doesn't seem to work ;)

[07:38] <Aankhen``> No sweat.

[07:39] <Aankhen``> Mind if I do some hacking on it in general?

[07:39] <Aankhen``> I get an itch in my fingers every time I see HTML.

[07:39] <moritz> go right ahead

[07:39] <Aankhen``> Yey.

[07:57] <Aankhen``> moritz: Good luck. :-)

[09:03] <masak> especially code and ASCII art are a lot nicer

[09:04] <moritz> masak: thank you

[09:04] <moritz> so it's 3:0 for fixed with font, my own vote not included (because I'm not sure yet)

[09:04] <moritz> s/with/width/

[09:05] * moritz mooses about using single line substitution regexes to modify the previous line of the author ;)

[09:06] <Aankhen``> Well, see if this makes you feel any differently: I would not suggest for a second that a fixed-width font is more readable than a variable-width font, but I think fixed-width is much better where there's any chance of code or otherwise alignment-sensitive text.

[09:06] * moritz is convinced ;)

[09:06] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[09:07] <Aankhen``> Regarding substitution regexes: it's a great idea, but people seem to be way too loose with the syntax they use. :-P

[09:09] <moritz> I know, I wasn't entirely serious about them ;)

[09:10] <Aankhen``> Ah well.

[09:10] <Aankhen``> It would be nice to have, though.

[09:10] <Aankhen``> Except for data loss, of course.

[09:10] <Aankhen``> Wait, you wouldn't have to lose data.

[09:11] <Aankhen``> Hey, you're in #perl6 now buddy.  You don't get to use the N word!

[09:12] <moritz> for me that's not negatively connotated

[09:12] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[09:12] <Aankhen``> I always thought of "nerd" as a rather negative word.

[09:12] <Aankhen``> "geek" seemed to be the positive oen.

[09:14] <moritz> maybe my notion is just screwed up ;)

[15:19] <pmurias> kp6-perl5 or COMPILER::?

[15:20] <fglock> both, actually - but COMPILER is more important; kp6-perl5 is a bit perl5-specific

[15:21] <fglock> I've got a looong list of to-do tasks - that's why I decided to pause and make a grand plan

[15:22] <fglock> the roadmap is already obsolete, btw

[15:23] <fglock> the critical path is no longer the regex engine; it can reuse PGE/PCR; the kp6-regex will only be needed by JVM and the like

[15:23] <fglock> same for the object system, with parrot-OO and perl5-Moose

[15:24] <fglock> this will simplify things

[18:16] <moritz_> re

[18:18] <ibrown> hey moritz, can you peep a url for me right quick tell me why the loop might be roxored?

[18:19] <ibrown> http://sial.org/pbot/25707

[18:19] <lambdabot> Title: Paste #25707 from "ibrown" at 63.175.130.15

[18:19] <moritz_> peeping...

[18:19] <ibrown> thanks man

[18:19] <ibrown> its annoying.

[18:19] <moritz_> which of these is line 23?

[18:21] <ibrown> the while loop

[18:22] <ibrown> sorry

[18:23] <moritz_> sorry, but I can't tell that without context and testing

[18:24] <moritz_> first you should try to get rid of that warning - it tells you that something is terribly wrong

[18:24] <moritz_> do you 'use strict; use warnings;' ?

[18:25] <ibrown> yeah

[18:25] <ibrown> 2 secs

[18:25] <moritz_> and for the looping.. maybe if you transfer in text mode, some line endings may change, thus never resulting in equally sized files

[18:29] <ibrown> cause the way it's setup right now, i lose some images.

[18:29] <ibrown> like 1/2 the image on occasion

[18:29] <ibrown> i'm assuming cause the ftp session disconnected.

[18:31] <moritz_> ibrown: I think your approach is wrong.. transmit all data, then check on the remote host if it was transfered OK, and only then delete data

[18:31] <ibrown> i'm using net::ftp tho

[18:32] <ibrown> so isn't ftp->put($file) equiv. of doing it that way?

[18:32] <ibrown> or does that method not have a callback -> launches process of sending, and goes to next line in script

[18:33] <moritz_> you should test the return status of ftp->put

[18:33] <ibrown> with eval?

[18:33] <moritz_> no

[18:33] <moritz_> my $return_status = $ftp->put($file)

[18:34] <ibrown> sorry, i suck at error checking

[18:34] <ibrown> then if return_status = 1 it's success tru?

[18:34] <moritz_> at least that's what I'm guessing while skimming over the docs

[18:35] <moritz_> ibrown: no. Read that documentation

[18:35] <ibrown> kk 2 secs

[18:35] <moritz_> it tells you what it returns on success

[18:35] <ibrown> ugh. it's annoying, i got this db to rebuild and i have to fix this damn script i shouldn't have written the way i wrote it months and months ago lol

[18:36] <ibrown> oh so it says it returns the remote filename if none was given

[18:36] <ibrown> so i guess that means the value would be the filename passed to put

[18:37] <ibrown> is that a syntaxual thing, where, the cmd waits for eval when you store result into array?

[18:37] <ibrown> or is that just me being a retard newb?

[18:37] <ibrown> oh shit

[18:37] <ibrown> you know what

[18:37] <ibrown> the ftp_put routine.

[18:37] <ibrown> after the put ,i had $ftp->quit

[18:37] <ibrown> i'm a moron

[18:38] <ibrown> dammit

[18:38] <moritz_> ibrown: I don't know that ftp_put is, never seen its definition

[18:38] <moritz_> s/that/what/

[18:40] <ibrown> its my home-grown routine

[18:40] <ibrown> sub ftp_put($){

[18:40] <ibrown> my ($filename,$ftp) = @_;

[18:40] <ibrown>     print $filename, "\t:filename\n";

[18:40] <ibrown>         my $put_return =    $ftp->put($filename)

[18:40] <ibrown>                or die "Cannot get file $filename \n", $ftp->message;

[18:40] <ibrown>         print $put_return, " is the return\n";

[18:40] <ibrown> #$ftp->quit;

[18:40] <ibrown> }

[18:40] <ibrown> just the simple put.  j00 kno

[18:41] <ibrown> i like to organize the code into 2 sections.

[18:41] <moritz_> sorry, but you are doing bs here ;)

[18:41] <moritz_> compare the first two lines

[18:41] <ibrown> no i'm all about help homey.  

[18:42] <moritz_> ftp_put($) declares it needs one parameter

[18:42] <ibrown> i've taught myself perl as much as i know it now, without mailing lists/irc or people to teach me

[18:42] <moritz_> and in the next you are reading two parameters out of @_

[18:42] <ibrown> yeah, i just changed the script adding a function for connect/disconnect

[18:42] <moritz_> no, your general concept is fine, only these two lines are bogging me

[18:43] <ibrown> oh

[18:44] <ibrown> yeah i was adjusting the paramaters, added the ftp_put require $ftp variable

[18:44] <ibrown> so i could do the actual connect earlier, and pass the var around.

[18:44] <ibrown> previously, the whole foreach of files was one routine, and it would chop images off

[18:45] <pasteling> "ibrown" at 63.175.130.15 pasted "Whole Bo-Bo" (68 lines, 1.6K) at http://sial.org/pbot/25708

[18:46] <ibrown> that's the URL to the whole thing

[18:46] <ibrown> so you can kinda get a grasp as to what i was trying to explain.

[18:46] <ibrown> i know i didn't need a heredoc either, i just like them kinda

[18:47] <ibrown> i think that'll work now tho correctly, hopefully the picdesk will get off my ass now

[18:56] <ibrown> awesome. its chugging along now.

[20:44] <Juerd> It's never gonna make it in 5 :)

[20:45] <wolverian> uh oh, feather's rebooting.. everyone /layout save; /save quickly! 

[20:46] <Juerd> It's so damned slow :(

[20:47] <wolverian> what is?

[20:47] <Juerd> feather

[20:47] <wolverian> oh. yeah.

[20:47] <Juerd> I still don't know what exactly makes it so slow.

[20:47] <Juerd> memory test goes well, harddisks work at full speed, raid array works at full speed, the system is responsive

[20:47] <Juerd> Network works well and at low latency

[20:47] <Juerd> But *programs* go wrong

[20:48] <Juerd> There's no rootkit, according to two checkers

[20:50] <wolverian> maybe a reboot will fix it :) 

[20:51] <Juerd> It's been rebooted before

[20:54] <Juerd> Creating ramfs...

[20:54] <Juerd> This may break at reboot :(

[20:55] <Juerd> initrd needs modules, I don't know which.

[20:55] <Juerd> Let's hope udev is sufficient

[20:56] <wolverian> sounds scary, whatever you're doing

[20:57] <Juerd> Argh. I'm just stopping the timer

[20:57] <Juerd> Until it's done

[20:57] <Juerd> I hadn't expected it to be so slow during update-initramfs

[22:12] <Juerd> Defective memory module

[22:12] <TimToady> ah

[22:13] <Juerd> Was still working, but incredibly slowing down the entire system

[22:13] <TimToady> continuous interrupts, likely...

[22:13] <Juerd> The thing was too hot to touch initially - 75 celcius.

[22:13] <Juerd> [IR thermometer]++

[22:13] <Juerd> So feather is up with 1 GB now.

[22:14] <TimToady> if something interrupts continuously it can appear to work but interfere with everything...

[22:20] <meppl> good night

[22:20] <Juerd> Ah. I didn't do this :)

[22:21] <TimToady> hmm, http://commitbit.pugscode.org/admin/project/Pugs/people gets a proxy error

[22:21] <TimToady> so does the bare name

[22:21] <Juerd> moritz_: Trac is enabled now.

[22:21] <TimToady> "connection refused"

[22:21] <Juerd> But it's still dog slow.

[22:22] <TimToady> did you change IP addr?

[22:22] <Juerd> TimToady: No. It probably means that someone, a user, hasn't made their webserver reboot proof.

[22:23] <TimToady> odd to get a connection refused from it if that's the case

[22:23] <Juerd> Not really.

[22:23] <Juerd> That just means there's nothing listening on the specified port

[22:23] *** Conrad joined
[22:23] <Juerd> Which is port 6666

[22:23] * daxim_ gets his kicks on port 6666

[22:23] <TimToady> on feather?

[22:26] <Juerd> TimToady: Yes.

[22:26] <Juerd> I don't know who had a server running on that port

[22:28] <TimToady> commitbit.pugscode.org and feather.perl6.nl are the same machine!

[22:32] <TimToady> oh, I understand what you were saying earlier now.  it's commitbit itself that isn't rebootproof

[22:33] <Juerd> That hasn't worked the past few days

[22:33] <Juerd> It took more than a day to do just the root filesystem, without the homedirs...

[22:34] <moritz_> btw speaking of load... one of the packages.debian.org servers had a load of > 3000 shortly after reboot ;)

[22:34] <Juerd> Wow

[22:34] <Juerd> Highest I've ever seen is 1015

[22:34] <moritz_> not too bad either ;)

[22:34] <moritz_> fork while fork ;-)

[22:35] <moritz_> and you're there... but then you can't run `uptime` any more to monitor it *g*

[22:36] <Juerd> Uhhuh

[22:36] <Juerd> This was on an actual production machine, dieing from broken hardware

[22:37] <Juerd> The output of uptime(1) was the last thing it ever displayed before it crashed showing a 80x25 grid of colourful random characters, some of them blinking

[22:37] <TimToady> I think we want to run /data/svn/commitbit as user www-data, probably.  does anyone else know any better?

[22:37] <Juerd> I think /data/svn/* is the repository and must not be executed

[22:38] <TimToady> hmm

[22:38] <Juerd> There's probably a checkout somewhere

[22:38] <TimToady> probably audreyt's copy then

[22:38] <Juerd> Perhaps :)

[22:39] <Juerd> Will at least be safer to try

[22:40] <TimToady> but I do know it was running as user www-data, not as audreyt

[22:40] <moritz_> why shouldn't programs in the repository be executed?

[22:42] <Juerd> moritz_: Because it may detect from where it's running, and drop state files there.

[22:46] <moritz_> Juerd: good point

[22:46] <Juerd> Or worse: change them :)

[22:46] <Juerd> I don't think svn likes it when you start changing its data without notifying it :)

[22:47] <Juerd> Which is one of the reasons that I want to make feather a virtual machine of which I can take snapshots

[22:47] <Juerd> Another reason is that I can then reboot the hardware without rebooting the operating system you guys use.

[22:47] <Juerd> Which, given how "well" people make things reboot proof, would be a great improvement.

[22:47] <Juerd> But it first needs more memory :)

[22:48] <Juerd> And, when it runs xen, important things can be moved to a more secure virtual machine

[22:49] <TimToady> there is only one executable commitbit on the machine, it seems, and that's in /data

[22:50] <TimToady> (according to locate)

[22:50] *** Limbic_Region joined
[22:51] <TimToady> possibly it's run under some other name, like jifty...

[22:56] <Juerd> TimToady: But locate's database hasn't been updated in a while, because of load issues. It's currently updating, but scanning the entire filesystem takes a while

[22:59] <TimToady> ah, that might explain why I'm getting more results as time goes on...

[22:59] <moritz_> feather's "fast" again, p6-on-parrot passing sanity, more life on p6l and p6c - looks like a good time for perl 6 

[22:59] <Juerd> Nah, someone's just hacking a lot of code in a very short time span

[23:00] <Juerd> moritz_: As for real speed, a hardware upgrade would be nice but since I'm almost bankrupt, I can't do that

[23:00] <Juerd> So it's "fast", not fast.

[23:00] <moritz_> Juerd: I know

[23:01] <Juerd> I'd like to upgrade it to a dual core system with 4 GB ram, one day.

[23:01] <moritz_> Juerd: you should ask if you could get a microgrant for hardware, as you already pondered

[23:01] <Juerd> Yea

[23:01] <moritz_> and pmichaud gained a few contributers, thats (perl6)++ as well ;)

[23:02] <moritz_> and fglock gained a kp6-contributer ;)

[23:03] <TimToady> hmm, root is running two finds at once.  that's gotta hurt...

[23:04] <Juerd> Cache should make it not hurt.

[23:04] <Tene> presuming they're accessing the same parts at the same time, or that all accessed parts completely fit into cache.

[23:04] <TimToady> maybe they're on different filesystems...

[23:04] <diakopter> I started mine before Juerd's :P

[23:05] <TimToady> nope, they look identical

[23:05] <diakopter> updatedb, I mean

[23:05] <Juerd> diakopter: You're also running updatedb.

[23:05] <Juerd> Heh.

[23:05] <Juerd> I'm killing mine then.

[23:06] <TimToady> sigh...once an SA, always an SA...  :)

[23:06] <Juerd>  SA?

[23:06] <TimToady> Sysadmin

[23:06] <TimToady> sez someone who spent an inordinate amount of time upgrading to F7 over the last week

[23:07] <TimToady> and still can't get gnome working on his laptop...

[23:08] <Juerd> And trac, I don't know how it was written, in what language and using what methods

[23:08] <Juerd> But it SUCKS, performance-wise.

[23:08] <diakopter> python

[23:08] <Juerd> My god, that's a heavy CGI.

[23:09] <Juerd> The CGI regularly uses up to 45 MB of RAM, and takes a few *seconds* to load.

[23:09] <Juerd> I saw it has a fcgi equivalent. Anyone interested in making it work with that?

[23:11] <diakopter> either fcgi or mod_python would help...

[23:13] <diakopter> hmm well, current lore dictates the use of tracd

[23:13] <diakopter> (over mod_python and fcgi)

[23:14] <Juerd> diakopter: Can you make that happen?

[23:14] <Juerd> I'm off to bed
