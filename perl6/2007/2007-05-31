[00:06] <Aankhen``> Hmm... "It's worth noting if you do not define parameters with the read-write trait explicitly, they will be copies, not references." # aren't they readonly aliases to the variables passed in by default?

[00:13] <Aankhen``> Also, "You can also explicitly make your parameters have a name, by prefixing it with :" # this isn't really very clear.  You might want to say something like: "You can force certain parameters to always be passed by name rather than positionally, by prefixing them with :."

[00:14] <Aankhen``> The original version makes it seem as if all you're doing in :$foo is explicitly marking that parameter as having the name "foo".

[00:14] <Aankhen``> thoughtpolice++ though, nice article again. :-)

[00:15] <thoughtpolice> thanks :)

[00:15] <thoughtpolice> i have two in draft, the round 3 and an interlude

[00:15] <Aankhen``> I wait with bated breath.

[00:15] <Aankhen``> What's the interlude?

[00:15] <thoughtpolice> but the interlude will probably come a bit later after I've collected more thoughts

[00:16] <thoughtpolice> coming from a haskell background I like functional programming. so the article is about functional[-esque] programming in perl 6.

[00:16] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[00:17] *** weinigLap_ joined
[00:17] *** prism joined
[00:18] <thoughtpolice> so far I've gotten a section on higher order functions, and as I work with it more I'll find more parts of the language that relate to functional programming.

[00:18] <thoughtpolice> Aankhen``: I made the changes, though.

[00:19] <Aankhen``> That's cool, thoughtpolice++ :-)

[00:19] <thoughtpolice> :)

[00:19] <thoughtpolice> higher order functions are the bomb. i got really close to them because of haskell.

[00:19] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[00:19] <thoughtpolice> and now I don't think I can go back to passing function pointers 'n stuff.

[00:19] <Aankhen``> (languages without higher-order functions)--

[00:20] <thoughtpolice> agreed.

[00:20] * Aankhen`` tries to think of some modern dynamic languages without HOFs

[00:20] <Aankhen``> .

[00:21] <Aankhen``> I wonder if PHP qualifies.

[00:21] <Aankhen``> IIRC, you can pass functions as values and create anonymous functions, but there's some weird syntax for it.

[00:21] <thoughtpolice> i wouldn't know off the top of my head; i 'quit' php a while back.

[00:22] <Aankhen``> I never did PHP, just picked up some stuff from being exposed to way too much.

[00:22] * Tene highly recommends the book 'higher order perl'

[00:22] <thoughtpolice> i met this girl called rails and a friend called seaside, and shortly thereafter me and php broke up. :(

[00:22] <Aankhen``> LMAO.

[00:22] <Aankhen``> Nice way to put it.

[00:22] <thoughtpolice> i thought so too.

[00:23] <thoughtpolice> we agreed (or, at least, I stated) it was better for both of us.

[00:23] <Aankhen``> I thought PHP was neat when I first heard about it.  Then I started reading about it, and I couldn't stand it.

[00:24] <thoughtpolice> i just kind of started like, you know, hating it.

[00:24] <Aankhen``> Hehe.

[00:24] <Aankhen``> Okay, I'mma go back to Lisp now.

[00:25] <thoughtpolice> it felt messy and bloated (one namespace? :/), and once I saw how much more abstractly I could accomplish things in say, Rails, with a nice design pattern to boot, there wasn't a question in my mind.

[00:26] <thoughtpolice> then again I'm not much of a web developer these days, but when I have to, I try to do rails or at least use a framework of some sort.

[00:26] <Aankhen``> Have you seen Catalyst?

[00:26] *** knewt joined
[00:27] <thoughtpolice> that perl framework? Yeah, I haven't investigated it too much

[00:27] <Aankhen``> It's really very useful.

[00:27] <thoughtpolice> saw something on reddit a while back, Catalyst vs. Rails or something I think.

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> i haven't heard much of it though in discussion, however. just from the jist of the article though I got interested to a degree.

[00:28] <Aankhen``> You should check it out if you're doing any Web development. :-)

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> note this is really befeore I got into perl 6 and whatnot, so I have an excuse :P

[00:28] <Aankhen``> Hehehe.

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> 'cause until I started with perl 6

[00:28] <thoughtpolice> I'd say I hadn't done perl in like, 3 years.

[00:28] *** rashakil joined
[00:29] <Aankhen``> Owa.

[00:29] <thoughtpolice> some trivial apps and whatnot; when I saw pugs and perl 6 my feeling for the language was fairly revived as I'm sure you can tell.

[00:29] <Aankhen``> Perl 6 has that effect. ;-)

[00:29] <thoughtpolice> one of them got used by a commercial company, though

[00:29] <thoughtpolice> some old port scanning code I wrote.

[00:30] <Aankhen``> Fun.

[00:30] <thoughtpolice> it was unbearably slow but the person who emailed me said they liked it because A) it was simple. B) they didn't have to write it. C) speed was of little importance since the thing only had to be run once every so often or somesuch.

[00:30] <thoughtpolice> but I was about 14 at the time

[00:30] <thoughtpolice> so I was pretty proud

[00:36] <thoughtpolice> yeah, my cpu usage shot to like 100% in an instant and half my stuff became totally unresponsive. luckily I have screen + ssh though so I didn't really lose anything.

[00:36] <thoughtpolice> what was weird is it didn't do it until like, 75% way through the update.

[02:09] <ingy> which is legal but annoying

[02:09] <ingy> and hard to write tests for that work against saner implementations

[02:10] <ingy> so I want to complain to you gaal 

[02:10] <ingy> :)

[02:22] <TimToady> didn't you help write the spec?

[02:43] <evalbot_r16576> Error: No such subroutine: &s1

[02:43] <dduncan> how come no compile time errors?

[02:44] <dduncan> anyway, what I wanted to demonstrate was that the second example gave different compile time errors than the first

[02:44] <dduncan> the first example complained that $v2 was not declared

[02:44] <dduncan> but the second was a lot more cryptic, simply saying Unexpected "$v1" ...

[02:45] <dduncan> the $v2 not being declared was the problem, but it took me awhile to figure out why I got the other error, since things looked syntactically correct

[02:45] <dduncan> (and the not being declared was due to a misspelling)

[02:45] <dduncan> so it seems invoking a positional arg gives the better error, but a named arg the worse error

[02:46] <dduncan> evalbot doesn't show it, but you can try entering the snippets I quoted at the pugs command line

[08:47] <Aankhen``> Yay, v0.0.0!

[08:50] <dduncan> well, the Perl 5 version will go out right then

[08:50] <dduncan> the Perl 6 version, whenever Pugs does

[08:51] <dduncan> possibly at a later version number by that time

[08:52] <Tene> dduncan: very nice

[08:58] <dduncan> fyi, anyone who would end up using QDRDBMS would probably be writing code like in the current Validator.pm, which doubles as a SYNOPSIS of sorts, or more likely they would use a bunch of wrapper functions to make it more terse as appropriate to their needs

[08:59] <dduncan> writing in ASTs tends to be verbose

[08:59] <moritz> Tene: does it work? *g*

[08:59] <Tene> moritz: mostly.  couple of glitches had to be smoothed over, but mostly it works great. :)

[09:01] <dduncan> fyi, this example basically illustrates performing a 3-data-table join plus a search

[09:01] <dduncan> it also illustrates loading said tables, in a roundabout way, roundabout being that, in this case, the tables are lexical variables

[09:02] <dduncan> in fact, this code is directly derived from a p6l post I made 1-2 months ago

[09:02] <dduncan> the one that requested some relational operators in Perl 6

[09:02] <dduncan> relational meaning for databases in this context

[09:03] <dduncan> that post included a use case example of why a relational join is useful, and had examples about farmers

[09:04] <Tene> I remember reading that post.  I thought you were just a madly-raving nutjob at the time. ;)

[18:48] <xinming> moritz: No, I mean, maybe, the next version of perl will get more support on functional programming style. and keep perl 6 itself intaint. though, grammer might change, But not much.

[18:48] <xinming> though, that's too far,

[18:49] <xinming> As I just read synopsis. And I finally find, there are too many functional programming stuff.

[18:49] <gaal> Data.Sequence, that is

[18:49] <xinming> reduction curry lazy list etc..

[18:50] <moritz> xinming: why "too many"? if you don't want to use them, don't use them ;)

[18:50] <lumi> moritz: Semantics? I'm not sure how you'd transform all expressions into lazy ones, apply static typing and type inference, etc, with macros

[18:50] <xinming> But currently larry might not be able to think in haskell very well, so he can't steal lots. :-)

[18:50] <moritz> lumi: yes, especially the lazyness might behard;)

[18:51] <xinming> moritz: No, I like these. It's really an amazing thing to see that a language has all power in other language, and keep the syntax really understandable.

[18:51] <gaal> lumi: I'd say let it be [Var] for now

[18:51] <lumi> moritz: But maybe you can just make a (module) macro that will take the rest of your program, and transform every expression inside it

[18:52] <lumi> gaal: What do I need to do to plug it into newval then? a Boxable instance?

[18:53] *** dmq is now known as demq

[18:53] <gaal> an empty instance should do, i think

[18:53] <gaal> "instance Boxable PureList"

[18:54] <lumi> Looking at Meta.Str, it defines a Boxable instance with its class in

[18:54] <lumi> So it belongs in Meta.List, I guess

[18:54] <lumi> So I'm doing the right thing :)

[18:55] <gaal> oh, right; that's where you wire a method table etc. to the hs type

[18:56] *** demq is now known as dmq_

[18:56] <lumi> Maybe I'll just try the tiniest possible class and see if it works

[18:57] <gaal> also on your todo list are making "vv" work for lists, and ensuring the instances (Pugs.Class:72 and on) are suitable for the particular methods you need

[18:58] *** dmq_ is now known as dmq

[18:58] <gaal> the tiniest possible class doesn't have any methods you define; you just do vv(<a b>).methods and hope it works :)

[18:58] <gaal> the Pugs.Class stuff is pretty magical

[18:58] <lumi> I'm not sure I understand these instances

[18:58] <lumi> Yes, looks magic

[18:59] <gaal> they're what you need to get calls of various arities get dispatched

[19:00] <lumi> vvToVal is kinda evil-looking

[19:00] <gaal> the [: :] stuff, btw, is "parr", a fast datastructure very similar to hs lists

[19:01] <lumi> I thought it was an array?

[19:01] <gaal> you need -fparr for it to work, and then you can even patmatch against it IIRC

[19:01] <gaal> yeah. it's similar to lists in usage. :)

[19:02] <gaal> vvToVaal isn't evil, it's just a bunch of thunks

I think we're getting eq and friends returning (True|False) to mean "true", and the boolean tests just all happen to test against the True part rather the False part, so it always looks true in boolean context, unless you actually ask whether it is also === False, in which case you get a bogus result

[23:24] <PerlJam> prism: Tell me what we'll use in their place when there aren't keyboards anymore

[23:24] <TimToady> prism: which language do you think perl 6 wasn't based on?  :)

[23:24] <prism> TimToady, I wanted it on an erlang base :) 

[23:25] <moritz> Aankhen``: too many (parentheses)

[23:25] <Aankhen``> Yech.

[23:25] <Aankhen``> I tried learning Erlang, and it was really boring. :-(

[23:25] <prism> Aankhen``, i think its pretty fun

[23:25] <Aankhen``> moritz: That's because everything is a list, after all.

[23:25] <prism> PerlJam, voice to camel :)

[23:25] <Aankhen``> prism: Well, I didn't give it much of a chance.

[23:25] * moritz comes from a town called "Erlangen" ;)

[23:25] <PerlJam> prism: I think we've all seen how well that (doesn't) work.

[23:25] <prism> moritz, is it a distributed town :)

[23:26] <Aankhen``> prism: I started following along with some tutorial and didn't even complete it because the language just seemed so unappealing.

[23:26] <prism> perlbot, langauges will evolve alongside technology

[23:26] <PerlJam> I know nothing about erlang.  What does it bring to the conceptual table?

[23:26] <moritz> prism: at least it distributed me to Scotland ;)

[23:26] <prism> Aankhen``, use it enough it will seem great

[23:26] <prism> moritz, hehe :P

[23:26] <PerlJam> (lua doesn't seem to bring much though there are people who like it)

[23:26] <prism> PerlJam, its a fully OO easily distributed language

[23:26] <moritz> PerlJam: it has no "use strict;" afaict 

[23:26] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: Erlang is all about distributed, fault-tolerant computing. It's basically built around message-passing concurrency. Or at least that's my understanding of the language.

[23:26] <prism> used in phone networks and satalites

[23:26] <prism> can handle 2000+ conns with ms responce times to all

[23:26] <prism> on common hardware

[23:27] <PerlJam> gotcha.

[23:27] <prism> derived roughly from LISP

[23:27] <Aankhen``> Really? o_O

[23:27] <Aankhen``> I don't see any similarities. O_o

[23:27] <PerlJam> now you're making me not like it.

[23:27] <prism> Aankhen``, but the book lol

[23:27] <Aankhen``> Oh, I never touched any Erlang book.

[23:27] <prism> s/but/buy/

[23:27] <Aankhen``> I'll give it another try some time.

[23:27] <Aankhen``> But not any time soon.

[23:27] <PerlJam> Well, if it's derived from lisp but doesn't look like lisp, it's probably okay  :)

[23:27] <prism> Aankhen``, its a necesity the first part is free on the website

[23:27] <Aankhen``> I'm too busy with Lisp. :-)

[23:27] <Aankhen``> i luvs teh lisp

[23:28] <prism> PerlJam, the website says it was sort of derived from lisp but lots of other languages got spots in the light too

[23:28] <prism> PerlJam, so its kind of a hybrid between quite a feqw

[23:28] <TimToady> P6 will have erlangish semantics in its underlayer, see http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/unify.html

[23:28] <lambdabot> Title: Unifying events and threads

[23:28] <prism> s/feqw/few/

[23:28] <TimToady> but P6 will also have better transactional support on top

[23:29] * PerlJam *really* looks forward to the day when we stop talking about perl 6 in the future tense.

[23:29] <prism> PerlJam, hmm maybe sooner than you think

[23:29] <Aankhen``> "Apocalypse Now" ~~ s/Apocalypse/Perl 6/

[23:29] <TimToady> okay, P6 has better transactional support on top  *cough*

[23:29] * moritz wants threaded IRC

[23:30] * prism wants IRC where /slap really works

[23:30] <PerlJam> prism: How soon do you think I think?  ;)

[23:30] <Aankhen``> moritz: Threaded as in threaded conversations?

[23:30] <prism> PerlJam, next week on thursday

[23:30] <moritz> Aankhen``: yes

[23:30] <PerlJam> TimToady: :-P

[23:30] <Aankhen``> moritz: Heh.

[23:31] <prism> btw

[23:31] <prism> whats the topic bout

[23:31] <prism> about*

[23:31] <Aankhen``> If you run `make install`, the Perl 6 modules will overwrite your Perl 5 modules.

[23:31] <PerlJam> TimToady: Are you willing to give odds on another major semantic change to Perl 6 Regex?  :)

[23:31] <prism> Aankhen``, ah lol

[23:31] <prism> Aankhen``, let me find a production server I dont like 8)

[23:32] <Aankhen``> LOL.

[23:32] <moritz> prism: you can circumvent that by building debian packages first ;)

[23:32] <Aankhen``> moritz: People like me are the reason why IRC could never have threaded conversations. :-P

[23:32] <prism> moritz, all the servers I have root on are freebsd

[23:32] <prism> except one which is netbsd ;p

[23:32] <moritz> Aankhen``: It's worth a thought

[23:32] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: we have threaded conversations all the time!

[23:32] <Aankhen``> Possibly.

[23:32] <PerlJam> (they just aren't marked)

[23:32] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: Pfft.

[23:32] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: BTW, I like chicken.

[23:33] <TimToady> yes

[23:33] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: Hey, have you seen the newest PotC movie?

[23:33] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: aye!

[23:33] <prism> hmm I tell you what is really needed for perl6 when it is released

[23:33] <prism> a gui version of cpan [perl5]

[23:33] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: How'd you like it?

[23:33] <dmq> prism, so write one

[23:34] <prism> dmq, I have enough writing this dumb website I started

[23:34] <Aankhen``> prism: Go fix CPANPLUS::Shell::Tk. ;-)

[23:34] <svnbot6> r16589 | Darren_Duncan++ | ext/QDRDBMS/ : renamed the AST node types Lit(Bool|Text|Blob|Int) to make the Lit a suffix ; made a few other small changes

[23:34] <prism> Aankhen``, ill look into it :)

[23:34] <PerlJam> Aankhen``: I liked it.  It was good.

[23:35] <Aankhen``> prism: Have fun!  Though if you're serious, I'd prefer ::Curses to work. ^_^

[23:35] <Tene> prism: how would that even work?  You mean something other than http://search.cpan.org/ ?

[23:35] <lambdabot> Title: The CPAN Search Site - search.cpan.org

[23:35] <Aankhen``> PerlJam: Ah, that's good. Apparently I'm going to be watching it on Saturday.

[23:35] <PerlJam> prism: Yeah, but which should you do?  Something *important* or your website?

[23:35] <Tene> prism: what would it do?

[23:35] <prism> Tene, yeah a nice little plugin for XFCE perl6-cpan quick installer :)

[23:35] <Aankhen``> Tene: I believe prism is referring to the CPAN shell.

[23:35] <Tene> Oh.

[23:35] * moritz wants cpan6

[23:35] <moritz> any news on that?

[23:36] <prism> hmm everything is a damn 6

[23:36] <Aankhen``> LOL, I should try out INTERCAL.

[23:36] <PerlJam> TimToady: Should I wait with bated breath or ask for the odds?  ;-)

[23:36] <Aankhen``> From the manual: "Caution! Under no circumstances confuse the mesh with the interleave operator, except under confusing circumstances!"

[23:36] <TimToady> yes

[23:36] <prism> I run FreeBSD 6, IPv6 and im in #perl6

[23:36] <prism> 666? yes please

[23:36] * Aankhen`` runs off.

[23:36] <prism> :P

[23:36] * PerlJam thinks TimToady has been replaced by Tron's bit

[23:37] <moritz> d'oh, even Perl 6 will come out before Debian 6 does ;)

[23:37] <TimToady> I'm downloading Fedora 7...

[23:37] <PerlJam> (which btw, as far as techno-movies go, I think *still* stands up well in light of the last 25 years of changes)

[23:40] <moritz> sleep++ &

[23:40] <PerlJam> Well, it's time for me to go to tae kwon do.  See you guys later!

[23:40] <PerlJam> TimToady: good luck with FC7  :)

[23:40] * PerlJam &
