[02:10] <cognominal> reading the  $.grep( array, fn, inv ) in  javascript jquery  library. It occurs to me that  in Perl 6,    !$fn  where $n is a function should return a function with the same signature but the opposite boolean.  Same with other unary operators.

[02:12] <cognominal> may be this should be restructed to context where a function with the said signature is expected. need to go to bed. I leave that as a note to myself and other people. May be that is already in the synopsis

[13:27] <avar> someone make cperl6-mode.el :)

[13:28] <moritz> avar: why not write a vim-syntax-hilight to emacs-syntax-hilight script?

[13:29] <moritz> avar: that would be _really_ neat (except that I don't "do" emacs ;-)

[13:30] <rgs> that would probably not be possible

[13:30] <rgs> in the general case

[13:31] <moritz> rgs: a script that works in most cases would be enough...

[13:31] <moritz> rgs: just like you can't generally solve the halting problem, you can solve it in nearly all real world cases

[13:32] <[particle]> the real problem is that nobody uses both vim and emacs ;)

[13:32] <moritz> *lol* that's true ;-)

[13:32] <rgs> and that it's really really difficult to map one model to another

[13:33] <moritz> ok, I have to admit that the .el has many more comments the the .vim

[13:34] <avar> and the .el actually works?:)

[13:44] <jerrylee> i saw in page http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/index.cgi?Pugs%20on%20MS%20Windows   PATH has parrot

[13:44] <lambdabot> Title: Pugs on MS Windows : MJWiki

[13:46] <moritz> jerrylee: no, pugs can be build withouth parrot backend (I do it most of the time)

[13:47] <jerrylee> moritz: thanks :)

[13:52] <jerrylee> strange, on "Pugs on MS Windows ", it doesn't require other modules

[13:52] <jerrylee> just activeperl, ghc, and pugs source

[13:52] *** bonesss joined
[13:52] <Limbic_Region> pugs used to require PGE for rules support and hence parrot but I put it in the head of audreyt and fglock that fglock's implementation should suffice

[13:52] <Limbic_Region> so now using PGE for rules support is optional

[13:52] <moritz> jerrylee: did you read INSTALL.v6-alpha?

[13:52] <jerrylee> moritz: obviously i didn't ;)

[13:53] <Limbic_Region> ?seen audreyt

[13:53] <lambdabot> audreyt is in #haskell and #perl6. I don't know when audreyt last spoke.

[13:54] <avar> where is the code that embeds PGE?

[13:54] *** vel joined
[13:55] <Limbic_Region> avar - when you run perl Makefile.PL it tells you if you want to use PGE to set an env variable.  I don't know what code uses it though

[13:56] <Limbic_Region> The only contributions I have made to pugs is being a sounding board, asking probing questions and offering some hair brained ideas, advocacy, financial support, a few examples, and some p5 code.  I don't touch pugs internals

[13:58] <jerrylee> moritz: weird, pugs.exe is built

[13:58] <agentzh> jerrylee: congrats :)

[13:59] <moritz> jerrylee++

[13:59] <fglock> yapc::sa hackathon going on :) though it'll take some hours to just show people what's going on

[14:00] <jerrylee> ;) i didn't know what happen, it's built before i make smoke

[14:01] <[particle]> fglock: i'll be about for parrot questions

[14:04] <moritz> jerrylee: the "smoke" target depends on the default target, so a smoke always builds pugs 

[14:05] <jerrylee> moritz: i see, maybe i built it already hours ago

[20:15] <lambdabot> Juerd is in #perl6. I last heard Juerd speak 1d 2h 25m 5s ago.

[20:20] *** dmq joined
[20:20] * dmq wonders what characters v matches in p6

[20:20] <dmq> also what characters \h matches in p6

[20:21] *** larsen_ joined
[20:23] * [particle] points dmq to http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/compilers/pge/PGE/Perl6Regex.pir

[20:23] <[particle]> search for esclist['h']

[20:24] <[particle]> i compiled that from the unicode url listed below that code paragraph

[20:25] <dmq> ok cool

[20:29] <dmq> thanks thats just what i wanted.

[20:29] <dmq> just curious, i see \R is documented as being [^\r], but the unicode regex spec recommends \R be a generic newline matcher.

[20:30] *** rindolf joined
[20:30] <rindolf> Hi all.

[20:31] <[particle]> regex spec as in S05?

[20:32] <dmq> something like (?>\x0D\x0A|\x0A\xD|\x0D|\x0A|unicode-newline-chars-go-here)

[20:33] <moritz> hi rindolf ;-)

[20:33] <rindolf> Hi moritz 

[20:33] <[particle]> dmq: parrot's idea of newline is the ascii part of the last line you typed

[20:34] <[particle]> ...and it doesn't look like we've implemented \R yet

[20:35] * dmq is looking for the document he just referenced, one sec

[20:36] <dmq> http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/

[20:36] <lambdabot> Title: UTS #18: Unicode Regular Expressions

[20:37] <dmq> specifically: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Line_Boundaries

[20:37] <lambdabot> Title: UTS #18: Unicode Regular Expressions

[20:38] <dmq> btw that pir file you linked to is quite impressive. thanks. 

[20:38] <fglock> svn.pugscode.org is down?

[20:38] <dmq> now if only it was that easy to define a new escape in p5 :-)

[20:39] <moritz> fglock: no, works for me

[20:39] <[particle]> that \R spec should be easy to implement for pge

[20:40] <fglock> I can't 'ci' :(

[20:40] <[particle]> fglock: password troubles?

[20:40] <dmq> the synopsis says \R will be [^\r]

[20:40] <dmq> (using p5 syntax of course)

[20:40] <moritz> I can 'up' at least

[20:41] *** SubStack joined
[20:41] <fglock> [particle]: no, more people with the same problem here, maybe some firewall (but I don't think so)

[20:41] <[particle]> dmq: sounds like a question for Fearless Leader

[20:41] <moritz> fglock: dns?

[20:41] <dmq> yes indeedy

[20:41] <fglock> moritz: testing

[20:41] <[particle]> svn.pugscode.org := 194.145.200.126

[20:42] <fglock> no, resolves ok

[20:42] <fglock> the error is "Could not parse response status line."

[20:42] <dmq> tr18 seems to forget about mac line endings tho. which is weird

[20:42] <moritz> weird

[20:45] *** Limbic_Region joined
[20:45] <moritz> fglock: maybe it could work with https:// instead of http:// because proxies can't interfere with that

[20:46] *** vel joined
[20:46] <fglock> moritz: I'll try

[20:48] <[particle]> dmq: yep, seems \u000A\u000D is conspicuously missing

[20:49] <dmq> i wonder if its a deliberate omision or a reasoned one.

[20:50] <[particle]> i can't say i'm sad to see it go

[20:50] *** nferraz joined
[20:51] <[particle]> nice to see japhy quoted theer

[20:52] <dmq> ?

[20:52] <fglock> moritz: I can't find where to set https instead of http

[20:52] <[particle]> [Friedl]

[20:52] <[particle]> jeffrey friedl === japhy

[20:52] <dmq> eh?

[20:52] <dmq> no

[20:53] <dmq> japhy is jeff pinyan. 

[20:53] <[particle]> oh, rats, you're right

[20:53] <dmq> afaik

[20:53] <moritz> fglock: I'd try .svn/entries, but that's just wild guessing

[20:53] <moritz> :q

[20:53] <moritz> sorry ;-)

[20:53] <[particle]> fglock: maybe svn relocate?

[20:53] <Khisanth> just /whois japhy :)

[20:53] <dmq> although i can see the mistake. they both have hacked the regex engine, and japhy started doing a regex book so they have a lot in common i guess.

[20:54] <fglock> [particle]: I'm scared of messing with svk

[20:54] <[particle]> fglock: so am i, which is why i've never used it :)

[20:54] <[particle]> dmq: yep, that's my confusion

[20:55] * dmq nods

[20:55] <[particle]> japhy moved to princeton just before i moved away, never got to meet him

[20:58] <Juerd> eden_c: pong?

[20:59] <eden_c> Juerd, I'm waiting for an answer about the account on feather

[20:59] <Juerd> Hm

[20:59] <Juerd> Let's see...

[21:00] <Juerd> Ah

[21:00] <Juerd> You're right

[21:00] *** offby1` joined
[21:01] <Limbic_Region> dmq - I referenced our conversation regarding the release of 5.10 today at PM but as the conversation happened in IRC land I only mentioned my side of the story.  That was intentional but not because I wanted to supress what you said - just that I don't like doing that without folks permission

[21:12] <jrockway> solution: switch pugs + parrot to git

[21:12] <jrockway> :D

[21:12] <moritz> are there git clients for windows?

[21:14] <[particle]> no, just cygwin

[21:19] <Juerd> eden_c: Check your mail

[23:52] <diakopter> TimToady: I don't suppose you have a copy of (any version of) Perl6::Perldoc's t_source directory lying around?  (it was accidentally excluded from the CPAN upload, it seems).  I'm trying to track down the 'make test'/'./Build test' errors, and it's a little difficult without the test generators.

[23:55] *** forsaken joined
[23:55] <TimToady> diakopter: sorry, I just have what everyone else has.

[23:55] <offby1> so why does @ come out 0?

[23:56] <TimToady> control-@ is the typical way to write a null

[23:56] <offby1> aaahhh

[23:56] * offby1 dope-slaps self

[23:56] <offby1> somehow I didn't notice that those were all control characters

[23:56] <TimToady> but it seems we've precluded \c[ from meaning escape, and haven't implemented \e

[23:57] <offby1> that syntax is amusingly similar to (one of the many) syntaxes that Emacs uses for keyboard input.
