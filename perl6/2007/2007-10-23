[06:40] <pugs_svn> r18576 | agentz++ | PCR - tracer now works in the console (mostly)

[06:43] <agentzh> to run the current tracer, try out the following commands:

[06:43] <agentzh> $ util/compile_p6grammar.pl -D examples/adder.grammar > Adder.pm

[06:43] <agentzh> $ perl -Ilib -MAdder -e 'print Adder->add("3 + 23")->(), "\n"'

[06:43] <moritz_> agentzh: is PCR updated to the "new" regex syntax already?

[06:43] <agentzh> moritz_: nope

[06:44] <agentzh> moritz_: (afaik)

[06:48] <agentzh> yay! examples/digits.grammar works with the tracer as well

[06:48] <agentzh> currently the tracer outputs are not human-readable...

[06:49] <agentzh> should be fed into another renderer

[06:49] <agentzh> >>BEGIN concat<< 248..270 at 5

[06:49] <agentzh> >>BEGIN group<< 248..252 at 5

[06:50] <agentzh> 248..270 is the positional range in the original .grammar file

[06:50] <agentzh> while "at 5" is the current parsing focus in the input string

[06:50] <agentzh> "concat" and "group" are both regex AST node names

[06:51] *** Casan joined
[06:51] <moritz_> agentzh: as a proof of concept you could write a regex syntax hilighter based on that output ;)

[06:51] <agentzh> moritz_: that's what i'm currently working on ;)

[08:14] <ruoso> considering everything must be able to stringify, would it be sane to implement the hash lookup based on the stringification of the object? It must be noted that this doesn't mean storing the string as the key, but only using it in the needed copmarisions inside the hash implementation...

[08:14] *** Aankh|Clone joined
[08:17] *** justatheory left
[08:19] <moritz_> that's what perl5 does, right?

[08:20] *** fglock joined
[08:21] <Aankh|Clone> Yes.

[08:21] <Aankh|Clone> Wait, what?

[08:21] <Aankh|Clone> :-P

[08:24] <fglock> ruoso: I'd use the object id instead

[08:24] <moritz_> is that backend specific?

[08:26] <ruoso> the object id wouldn't work for strings

[08:26] <ruoso> because different objects with the same value must match the same key

[08:26] <ruoso> moritz_, p5 stores the stringification

[08:26] <pugs_svn> r18577 | fglock++ | [kp6-perl5] allow mixed positional and named arguments

[08:26] <ruoso> I'm only using the stringification to comparisions

[08:26] <ruoso> not storing it

[08:27] <moritz_> ruoso: so use stringification for low-level values (Str, Num...) and ID for other objects?

[08:28] <ruoso> hmm... this would complicate things...

[08:28] <ruoso> because I would need to test if it is a low-level value or not

[08:28] <fglock> kp6: sub x ($a,$b){ print " $a-$b, " }; x(1,2); x( a=>3, b=>4 ); x( b=>6, a=>5 );

[08:28] <exp_evalbot> r18577: OUTPUT[ 1-2,  3-4,  5-6, ]

[08:28] <moritz_> but hash keys need to be immutable, right?

[08:29] <ruoso> moritz_, why?

[08:29] <moritz_> ruoso: in order to allow efficient lookup

[08:29] <ruoso> ah.. ok

[08:29] <ruoso> yeah..

[08:29] <moritz_> that's what the "hash" part of a hash is all about ;)

[08:29] <ruoso> heh

[08:30] <moritz_> so perhaps stringification isn't all that bad

[08:31] <moritz_> there was a reason for the way it was done in p5

[08:32] <ruoso> yep... but the problem is... this may end up with bad behaviour...

[08:32] <ruoso> for objects that does have stringifications

[08:32] <ruoso> that aren't unique when they should be

[08:33] <moritz_> ruoso: that's a trade off between efficiency and usability

[08:33] <ruoso> maybe a "hashcode" thing is needed

[08:33] <moritz_> ruoso: thou shalt not write object that stringify identically ;)

[08:33] <ruoso> heh

[08:34] *** Aankhen`` left
[08:34] <moritz_> and take hashcode if available, otherwise stringification?

[08:34] <ruoso> having to test that is a bad thing

[08:34] <ruoso> better to have mandatory "hashcode"

[08:34] <ruoso> the default implementation may be the stringification

[08:35] <moritz_> that makes sense

[08:36] <ruoso> but hashcode must always be a string...

[08:40] <fglock> ruoso: I don't think $dog1 and $dog2 must hash to the same thing, only Constants do

[08:41] <ruoso> fglock, if $dog1 = "foo"; and $dog2 = "foo"... yes, they do....

[08:41] <ruoso> if $dog1 = "123" and $dog2 = 123... hmmm... I think they should do...

[08:41] *** masak joined
[08:42] * moritz_ agrees

[08:42] <ruoso> if class Dog has only the memeber "name", and the hashcode is its name

[08:42] <ruoso> $dog1 with name "Rex" and $dog2 with name "Rex" should do also...

[08:42] <ruoso> other way you can't reproduce the key...

[08:42] <moritz_> ruoso: I don't think you can enforce that in the general case

[08:42] <ruoso> if that's the last reference you have

[08:43] <ruoso> moritz_, if the hashcode returns the name, yes...

[08:43] <moritz_> ruoso: so use .perl instead of .hashcode

[08:43] <moritz_> ruoso: right, but you can't be sure that the dumb perl author makes that right

[08:44] <ruoso> moritz_, that way the objects won't match

[08:44] <ruoso> that's normal

[08:44] <ruoso> the default hashcode for an object is it's id

[08:44] <ruoso> ok

[08:44] <ruoso> that solves the problem

[08:44] <moritz_> um, why not?

[08:44] <ruoso> the point is, you must have a way to make two objects match

[08:45] <Aankh|Clone> Why?

[08:45] <ruoso> and this is using the hashcode methods

[08:45] <Aankh|Clone> Er, two arbitrary objects or...?

[08:45] <moritz_> ruoso: so if you have two Dog objects, that have identical content, they won't match if you use ID

[08:45] <moritz_> ruoso: do you want that?

[08:45] <ruoso> yep... that would be the default

[08:45] <moritz_> ok

[08:45] <ruoso> so...

[08:46] <moritz_> and for strings you just return self?

[08:46] <moritz_> in .hashcode, I mean

[08:46] <ruoso> the basic values default for hashcode is the stringification

[08:46] <ruoso> objects return the id

[08:46] <ruoso> (stringified id for that matter...)

[08:46] <Aankh|Clone> <moritz_> ruoso: so if you have two Dog objects, that have identical content, they won't match if you use ID # isn't that the required behaviour for a hash table?

[08:47] <ruoso> Aankh|Clone, the problem is to know whether the objects must or must not match

[08:47] <moritz_> kp6: class Foo { has $.bar }; my $a = Foo.new(bar => 'baz'); say "$a";

[08:47] <exp_evalbot> r18577: OUTPUT[::Foo(...)␤]

[08:47] <ruoso> and that's the pourpose of the hashcode method

[08:47] <Aankh|Clone> ruoso: I'm not following you.

[08:47] <ruoso> that should be at the control of the programmer

[08:47] <Aankh|Clone> Mmm.

[08:47] <moritz_> and the default should be not to match

[08:47] <ruoso> think about a XML DOM node

[08:47] <ruoso> yep

[08:48] <moritz_> ok, then the stringification of an ID is a sensible default

[08:48] <ruoso> you probably want a XML DOM node to match based in it's name and attributes

[08:48] <ruoso> moritz_, yep.. like Foo(0x123123123)

[08:48] <ruoso> :)

[08:48] <moritz_> ruoso: but the current stringification doesn't include the ID - are you going to change that?

[08:49] <ruoso> nope...

[08:49] <moritz_> ok

[08:49] <ruoso> i'm changing that: for objects, the hashcode returns a stringified id

[08:49] <ruoso> probably with the tag like p5 does

[08:50] <ruoso> so $dog1 would stringify to Dog=0x123123123

[08:50] <moritz_> you can add a 'class hashcode', so .hashcode is a natural typecasting method

[08:50] <ruoso> s/stringify/hashcode/

[08:50] <moritz_> and in that class you can implement the hash algorithm

[08:50] <moritz_> and it inherits from Str or str

[08:50] <moritz_> Str, that is ;)

[08:51] <moritz_> or is that an abuse of the coercion/type casting sytem?

[08:52] <ruoso> maybe not...

[08:52] <ruoso> I don't know yet

[08:52] <ruoso> I'm thinking in the low-level yet...

[08:52] <ruoso> low-level doesn't have type casting system yet

[08:52] <ruoso> (for low-level, I refer yap6)

[08:53] *** iblechbot left
[08:55] <ruoso> I should probably wait for TimToady's opinion on that, before taking any decision...

[09:04] <moritz_> fglock: the status for gather/take should be updated as well

[09:05] *** faxathisia left
[09:06] <Aankh|Clone> <ruoso> you probably want a XML DOM node to match based in it's name and attributes # I'm not so sure about that.

[09:06] <ruoso> Aankh|Clone, just an example...

[09:06] <Aankh|Clone> <top><one foo="bar"/><two><one foo="bar"/></two></top>

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> That way, the <one foo="bar"/> within <top> and <one foo="bar"/> within <two> would match.

[09:07] <ruoso> no, because the parentNode would be different

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> Ah, so not just attributes then.

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> Not just XML attributes, that is. :-)

[09:08] <ruoso> yep..

[09:15] <moritz_> ok, so .WHICH is roughly the same as the intended .hashcode

[09:16] * masak is still very bad at keeping the different .WHO, .WHAT and .WHICH methods apart

[09:17] <Aankhen``> Yay.

[09:17] <moritz_> pugs: say "foo".WHAT

[09:17] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Str␤]

[09:17] <Aankhen``> So WHICH is not a macro?

[09:17] <Aankhen``> Just a regular method?

[09:17] <moritz_> pugs: say "foo".WHO

[09:17] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** No such method in class Str: "&WHO"␤    at /tmp/nUduFpqUy3 line 1, column 5 - line 2, column 1␤]

[09:17] <moritz_> Aankhen``: why should it be a macro?

[09:17] <moritz_> masak: there seems to be no .WHO method, and .WHAT returns the meta-object

[09:18] <Aankhen``> I didn't say it should, I was confirming that it isn't a macro, unlike one of the other all-uppercase method thingies...

[09:18] <Aankhen``> s/should/should be/

[09:18] <Aankhen``> S12 says that it is a macro, though.

[09:19] <fglock> moritz_:  looks good, thanks

[09:19] <Aankhen``> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S12.html#Introspection

[09:19] <lambdabot> Title: S12

[09:19] <moritz_> ok, whatever ;)

[09:19] <Aankhen``> "These are all actually macros, not true operators or methods."

[09:19] <moritz_> Aankhen``: does it make a difference?

[09:19] <Aankhen``> So if .WHICH is a macro, how does a class define that its own WHICH method is called instead? :-S

[09:19] <ruoso> moritz_, yep... WHICH is hashcode

[09:19] <lambdabot> ruoso: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[09:20] <Aankhen``> Then you'd have to use .'WHICH' or ."WHICH" or something everywhere to allow for custom methods.

[09:20] <Aankhen``> Unless the macro automatically calls that method!  Yay.

[09:21] * moritz_ still doesn't grok macros at all

[09:21] <moritz_> is there a _gentle_ introduction somewhere? no lisp please ;)

[09:21] <Aankhen``> Why?  Macros take an AST and transform it into another AST.

[09:21] <Aankhen``> Awww, what's wrong with Lisp?

[09:21] <moritz_> Aankhen``: the syntax

[09:21] <Aankhen``> Common Lisp macros are the easiest thing to understand.

[09:21] <Aankhen``> Bigot. :-P

[09:22] <moritz_> they just view an AST like a nested list, right?

[09:22] <ruoso> moritz_, now... if you have problems understanding macros... you'll realise why lisp is so hard ;)

[09:22] <Aankhen``> moritz_: A list in Lisp is actually just a tree, so the answer is "sort of".

[09:22] <Aankhen``> ruoso: What's hard about Lisp?

[09:23] <moritz_> ruoso: I never really tried, I have to admit ;)

[09:23] <Aankhen``> (By which I'm guessing you mean Common Lisp.)

[09:23] <ruoso> heh... everytime I try to customize emacs, i have a headache

[09:24] <ruoso> and quit after two minutes

[09:24] <Aankhen``> moritz_: Okay, here's one way to look at it: macros are regular functions that run at compile-time; they take an AST and transform it into another AST. That resulting AST is used in the compiled code in place of the call to the macro.

[09:24] <ruoso> :)

[09:25] <moritz_> Aankhen``: ok, that's nice... how do I access the AST in p6 macros?

[09:25] <Aankhen``> Some part of the arguments passed.

[09:26] <Aankhen``> I'm not sure how exactly, though.

[09:27] <moritz_> hm, ok

[09:27] <Aankhen``> Here we go: "In the absence of a signature to the contrary, a macro is called as if it were a method on the current match object returned from the grammar rule being reduced; that is, all the current parse information is available by treating self as if it were a $/ object."

[09:27] <moritz_> ok

[09:28] <moritz_> so basically you have to know the parser's internals to fiddle with macros

[09:28] <Aankhen``> Not the parser's internals, really.  But you do have to be familiar with the grammar, at least the part that you're transforming from and the part that you're transforming to.

[09:28] <ruoso> but there are also the quasiquotes

[09:29] <ruoso> which help with that

[09:29] <jql> it's a beautiful design tactic, though

[09:29] <ruoso> you may use quasiquotes to expand the macro

[09:29] <ruoso> then you don't need to know about the ast at all

[09:30] <Aankhen``> ruoso: Yes.

[09:30] <Aankhen``> jql: What is?

[09:30] * moritz_ waits with grokking macros until somebody write a tutorial with many examples

[09:30] <jql> the macro works by manipulating whatever "is supposed to be" in $/

[09:30] <jql> whatever that is. :)

[09:30] <Aankhen``> Heh/

[09:30] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[15:40] <lambdabot> ahmadz said 1m 7d 5h 2m 11s ago: "Did runpugs work with the new fixes on your machine (http://feather3.perl6.nl/runpugs)? (Remember to refresh cache just in case)"

[15:40] <moritz> that's a darn old message, and I'm sure I already read it

[15:41] <fglock> dlocaus: hi!

[15:41] <dlocaus> does anyone know of any good documentation on the "grammar" keyword?  I've been looking around trying to find specific syntax/keyword, and descriptions.

[15:41] <moritz> lambdabot seems to be a bit buggy

[15:41] <moritz> dlocaus: it's basically a class

[15:41] <moritz> dlocaus: but it usually consists of regex/rules/tokens

[15:41] <masak> dlocaus: did you check the synopses?

[15:42] <dlocaus> masak: yes, however the documentation didn't provide enough information

[15:42] <dlocaus> I was looking at testcase #17 in grammar last night, and I couldn't make head or tails of the grammar definition

[15:42] <masak> dlocaus: maybe grep the pugs repository for 'grammar'

[15:43] <masak> dlocaus: what testcase #17?

[15:43] <moritz> masak: probably kp6 testcase 17

[15:43] <dlocaus> It appears to be testing the grammar class..  There is a bug in it, in which that memory usage grows to 1gig, and then the program dies.

[15:44] <masak> oh.

[15:44] <dlocaus> I was removing lines of code to reduce the problem and see if I could debug it.

[15:44] <dlocaus> 17-complex-return.t

[15:45] <fglock> dlocaus: it works now, on the perl5rx backend

[17:10] <TimToady> I'd guess the snapshot mechanism is spinning trying to acquire a lock it can't get.

[17:11] <Juerd> Well, it does work, but incredibly slow

[17:11] <Juerd> 2 megabytes per second datatransfer on the snapshot

[17:12] <Juerd> And I have no idea how to debug a kernel :)

[17:12] <TimToady> are you backing the LVMs serially or concurrently?

[17:13] <Juerd> I'm not sure what you mean

[17:13] <TimToady> maybe they're fighting...

[17:13] <TimToady> is there more than one LVM that you're backing up?

[17:13] <Juerd> There's one big VG, that's on one big PV, which is one big MD raid array

[17:13] <Juerd> No, just one.

[17:13] <TimToady> nevermind then

[17:14] <Juerd> It does them sequentially because they're all on the same drives.

[17:14] <Juerd> And it works perfectly on other hosts. It has worked great on feather until the crash recently

[17:14] <Juerd> It probably caused the crash too

[17:15] <TimToady> seems like there's some way it's storing persistent locks that maybe arent GC'd even by a crash

[17:30] <spinclad> TimToady: is there a spec on the order of binding positional and named args to positional parameters?  as in sub f($a,$b) {...}; f(1,:a(2)); f(:a(2),1) ... does the 1 get bound to $b in either case?

[17:30] <[particle]> i usually download firefox first, then vim :)

[17:30] <dlocaus>  :), I've been using it for a long time.  I think a lot of keyboard short cuts are now hardwired into my finger muscles.

[17:31] <spinclad> or conversely, bound to $a, and 2 bound to $a as well?

[17:32] <wolv> oh, wow, git-svn cloning the pugs repo takes a while

[17:32] <spinclad> (i saw that :a(1),:a(2) could be bound to @a, but that's something else again)

[17:32] <allbery_b> TimToady++ (you just answered a completley unrelated problem I've been figting with this morning.  unfortunately it seems to be a sleepycat-- db bug)

[17:32] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[17:34] <spinclad> (checked the specs; S06 didn't seem to say)

[17:35] <TimToady> yes, the section on binding has evolved over time as pugs was being developed, and now seems less clear than it used to be.

[17:35] <integral> .oO( git-svn clone it on feather, then rsync the git repo home, wolv )

[17:37] <TimToady> at the moment it seems to say that binding order is controlled by the call's arguments rather than the formal parameter's order, but that seems wrongish to me; maybe that sentence was trying to say something else.

[17:39] <TimToady> my mental model is that you march through the formals left to right finding either a named binding or the next position if there's no named binding.

[17:39] <TimToady> *positional

[17:39] <wolv> integral: not a bad idea :)

[17:39] <Juerd> TimToady: Thanks for the link

[17:39] *** wolverian joined
[17:40] <Juerd> TimToady: I have to maintain two RPM-based servers too, so it might come in handy

[17:40] *** wolv left
[17:40] <TimToady> in any case, it's very important that parameter binding not end up O(N**2)

[17:41] <TimToady> pugs: sub f($a,$b){ "$a:$b" }; f(2,a=>1)

[17:41] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT["1:2"␤]

[17:41] <spinclad> thinking of the arguments translating to a Capture, with its separate @ and % aspects... it seems (to me) that the named args and positional args end up in different streams, with no ordering between them.  then it seems you can only specify @| then %|, or %| then @|, globally for the whole language...

[17:41] <wolverian> what's the path to the pugs repo on feather?

[17:42] <wolverian> if there is a public one, that is.. I just assumed it's on feather for some reason

[17:42] <spinclad> sorry, your 'my mental model' is a third possibility i missed.  good.

[17:43] *** weinig joined
[17:43] <wolverian> thanks :) 

[17:44] <spinclad> (well, that amounts to eat from %| then @|, for each parameter.)

[17:45] <TimToady> part of the reason for using proto subs is to allow mapping of named arguments to positional at compile time so we know the first N args can just be slapped in positionally

[17:46] <TimToady> so you don't pay the % lookup penalty for parameters that the sig is expecting positionally.

[17:46] <lambdabot> Title: Revision 18608: /

[17:46] <spinclad> indeed

[17:47] <Juerd> wolverian: http://feather.perl6.nl/svk.html

[17:47] <lambdabot> Title: SVK on Feather

[17:48] <Juerd> I want a way to backup feather1. The only safe way I can currently think of is to suspend the virtual machine and then copy its data

[17:48] <wolverian> well, there's no git-svk I think..

[17:48] <Juerd> Which would suck

[17:48] *** weinig_ joined
[17:48] <wolverian> so I did git-svn clone file:///... I'm not sure how proper that is :) 

[17:49] <TimToady> balancing out flexibility with efficiency while keeping a simple mental model is hard; we were very happy when we came up with the proto sub hack... :)

[17:49] <TimToady> but yes, the specs don't really seem to express it right yet

[17:49] <wolverian> well, getting one revision was quite fast 

[17:50] <spinclad> TimToady: this ('my mental model') answers my question then

[17:50] <cj> TimToady: when I mention implementing perl6 on the CLI (.NET), the first response I get is that stack-based virtual machines are not as well-suited for implementing dynamic languages as register-based VMs.  Can you tell me why someone might say that, or where I might read to get some details?

[17:50] <TimToady> another reason that the binding must happen in formal order is that we allow defaults to refer to previous formals

[17:50] <cj> TimToady: there's a lot of support from MS around implementing perl6 on the CLI

[17:50] <TimToady> so I think the sentence in S06 has the terms backwards

[17:52] <TimToady> uh, they must be assuming that they would be targeting the CLI via Parrot, which is regeister based.

[17:52] <TimToady> but there's nothing about the Perl 6 language that requires a register-based VM

[17:52] <TimToady> or a stack-based VM, for that matter

[17:57] *** TJCRI left
[17:59] <TimToady> a more interesting question is how hard it'll be to at least emulate continuations for purposes of pattern matching and logic programming; and whether that forces Perl 6 to keep its own runloop

[17:59] <wolverian> is irc.pugscode.org working?

[17:59] <wolverian> oh, it is

[18:00] <wolverian> I have a terrible urge to rewrite irclog in catalyst 

[18:01] <TimToady> another interesting question is the extent to which we can make their exception model fail-soft in a way that works well will parallel programming

[18:02] <TimToady> you don't want to be unwinding the whole stack merely because one element out of your million element hyperoperation turned out to be undefined....

[18:02] <[particle]> hopefully for .net users, ms will figure that out on their own

[18:03] <Tene> wolverian: port catalyst to Perl 6 first.

[18:03] <TimToady> unwinding the stack should be the last resort, and then only when you already know where you're unwinding it to.

[18:03] <wolverian> Tene, that's even more terrible :)

[18:04] *** wilx joined
[18:04] *** weinig left
[18:04] <TimToady> another question is on porting to the CLI is whether it can support STM efficiently.

[18:05] <TimToady> wolverian: can't be any harder than porting Perl 6 to Perl 6 first... :)

[18:07] <wolverian> I'll just take a few years off from university.. 

[18:07] <wolverian> should be done by christmas!

[18:10] <wolverian> hm.. the git svn repo doesn't have any branches, does it?

[18:11] <[particle]> no branches in pugs repo

[18:11] <wolverian> damn, I was hoping for some cute gitk graphs :)

[18:14] <Tene> wolverian: nah, svn is too fond of linear history for there to be anything interesting.

[19:42] <bkaney> Hi.  Are traits available in pugs 6.2.13?  I am having syntax troubles...

[19:46] <spinclad> 'traits' == roles?

[19:47] <bkaney> Yes. http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S12.html (Traits section)

[19:47] <lambdabot> Title: Synopsis 12: Objects - perl6

[19:50] *** barney left
[19:52] *** blindfish left
[19:54] <spinclad> i think full support of roles depends on a new meta-object model for pugs, which has been pending for most of a year now.

[19:54] <TimToady> as used in S12, traits !== roles

[19:54] <TimToady> in fact, we should rename traits to something else, "tweaks" maybe

[19:56] <TimToady> but yes, bare 6.2.13 is a year old now, and you'll have much better luck with the latest revision of pugs

[19:56] <bkaney> Okay.  I did the emerge (gentoo) and that's what I got, although there could be a new ebuild...

[19:56] <TimToady> even though it doesn't have a full MO implementation yet

[19:57] <TimToady> most of us just go straight from the svn repo

[19:59] <bkaney> yea, I'll have to do that and give it a shot and see what happens.  thanks.

[20:01] <TimToady> in any case, as soon as we give you a commit bit, you'll want the fresh version anyway.  :)
