[00:20] <raschipi> Oh, I see

[00:21] <timotimo> though tbh i didn't read the original question

[00:21] <raschipi> If you want steps instead of multiples, starting with the first, be it even or odd, and adding a step each time.

[00:22] <raschipi> That range should wield 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19

[02:03] <jaush> Greetings!  I'm encountered a problem whilst attempting first-ever zef install:

[02:03] <kurahaupo> skids: do you mean wrong for failing to warn about the duplicate :a ?

[02:04] <jaush> "zef install --/test cro" on Windows, with Rakudo Star version 2018.04.1 built on MoarVM version 2018.04.1

[02:04] <jaush> Enabled fetching backends [path pswebrequest] don't understand git://github.com/jnthn/p6-docker-file.git You may need to configure one of the following backends, or install its underlying software - [git curl wget]

[02:04] <kurahaupo> Obviously only one value can go in a named scalar parameter

[02:05] <jaush> i understand how to go about fixing this (dependency whack-a-mole), but it seems that the module manager should *just work*

[02:05] *** mcmillhj joined
[02:06] <jaush> re. chasing dependencies, is there some ready-made package with *all* necessary dependencies for windows 10 64-bit?

[04:02] <yy6p6> hi

[04:02] <yy6p6> how can I generate an executable for a file?

[04:02] <yy6p6> I want a jar

[04:03] <yy6p6> I use

[04:03] <yy6p6> ./perl6-j --target=jar --output="hello.jar" hello.p6

[04:03] <yy6p6> in hello.p6 i have

[04:03] <yy6p6> sub MAIN(){ 	say "hi"; }

[04:03] <evalable6> yy6p6, rakudo-moar ec0422e75: OUTPUT: ¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[04:05] <benjikun> I see a thread in which he uses `perl6 --target=jvm --output=name.jar name.p6`

[04:05] <yy6p6>  java -jar hello.jar   >>>>> no main manifest attribute, in hello.jar

[04:07] <benjikun> you probably have to add a manifest file manually then

[04:07] *** entonian left
[04:07] <yy6p6> @benjikun if I use --target=jvm I get null pointer exception; here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/running.pod it says that jar is an option

[04:08] <yy6p6> I think I did not write that MAIN sub as it should be 

[04:08] <yy6p6> but I am not sure

[04:09] <benjikun> Oops, jar is the correct option

[04:09] <benjikun> Apparently you can't run the jar that's created with any typical JVM

[04:11] <benjikun> According to this thread, there's some script that hasn't been implemented in rakudo to do this yet

[04:11] <yy6p6> I used rakudo

[04:11] <benjikun> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/standalone-jar/tools/jvm/one-jar-script.sh

[04:12] <yy6p6> isn't thare compiler that can do this? :(

[04:13] <MasterDuke> yy6p6: the jmv rakudo has some known problems

[04:14] <MasterDuke> recommend pinging bartolin if you have any questions, he's doing the most work on it right now

[04:19] <yy6p6> bartolin: is there any way to create a jar?

[04:22] <MasterDuke> yy6p6: fyi, i don't know exactly what timezone he's in, but he isn't usually active around now

[04:22] <MasterDuke> you can use the .tell command to leave him messages

[04:23] <yy6p6> thx

[04:23] <yy6p6> .tell

[04:23] <yoleaux> Relay a telegram to someone

[04:24] <MasterDuke> it's `.tell <name> <message>`

[04:25] <yy6p6> .tell bartolin is there any way to compile a file into an executable jar?

[04:25] <yoleaux> yy6p6: I'll pass your message to bartolin.

[13:25] *** mahafyi joined
[13:27] <timotimo> hm, if you have rakudo star 2018-04, surely your zef is new enough to understand that directive?

[13:27] <timotimo> what's the zef version? i think you get it from "zef info zef"

[13:30] <bazzaar> timotimo: Identity: zef:ver<0.4.2>, ... Installed: Yes, as zef:ver<0.3.1>

[13:30] <timotimo> hm, maybe update that?

[13:31] <timotimo> i have zef:ver<0.2.2> there and <0.4.2> available, but "zef install zef" doesn't think it should upgrade? hm.

[13:32] <timotimo> ok, now it's up to date on my end, too

[13:33] <bazzaar> it's the zef that came with Star 2018-04, I remember it installing I think?

[13:33] *** mcmillhj left
[13:34] <timotimo> ok, i see, 0.4.0 is only 4 days old

[13:37] <bazzaar> not sure why "zef info zef" gives me two version numbers 

[13:38] <timotimo> well, one is the one available on the ecosystem, one is the one you have installed at the moment

[13:40] <El_Che> install a local zef? zef --install-to=home install zef

[13:41] <El_Che> and make sure ~/.perl6/bin is before the paths for star

[13:41] <timotimo> that works?

[13:41] <timotimo> like, literally putting "home" there?

[15:51] <lizmat> yes, as only non-zero numerics are true

[15:51] <lizmat> indeed

[15:51] <lizmat> in Perl 5 -1 would be returned

[15:51] <lizmat> in Perl 6 it returns Nil if not found

[15:52] <uzl> Does the with does the job of if defined in Perl 5?

[15:52] <lizmat> yes, but more

[15:53] <uzl> Oh great, thanks!

[15:53] <lizmat> in perl 5 you would have to do something like: if (defined ($_ = 42)) { }

[18:28] *** espadrine_ left
[18:29] <jmerelo> slayergames: that, and everything else. ‚Ä¶ is a "generator", that makes the * + * lazily generate the sequence.

[18:30] <slayergames> is * a shortcut for a function?

[18:30] <jmerelo> slayergames: * is called "Whatever"

[18:31] <jmerelo> slayergames: it's variable, actually, or rather a "slot". It might be a bit confusing here, since the two * mean a different thing, but maybe see this

[18:31] <jmerelo> m: say (1, 1, {$^a + $^b} ... Inf)[^30]

[18:32] <jmerelo> slayergames: so first * is actually the first argument of the generating expression, which I call here $^a, second * is $^b, third * means "All elements of this sequence", and can be substituted by Inf (or Infinity)

[19:29] <timotimo> there it swings around

[19:30] <timotimo> it also does that in the one before, but it's in the second half of the output where the steps are far bigger

[19:30] <timotimo> so not as nice to see

[19:31] <timotimo> slayergames: did you get a good answer out of that? :D

[19:33] <slayergames> yes

[19:33] <slayergames> thanks

[19:33] <slayergames> what is .&[**]?

[19:33] <timotimo> ... is just super awesome in general

[19:33] <slayergames> is .& some kind of map?

[19:33] <timotimo> &[**] is syntactic sugar for &infix:<**>, i.e. the "real name" of the ** operator

[19:34] <slayergames> oh

[19:34] <timotimo> and foo.&bleh(bar) is syntax for &bleh(foo, bar)

[19:34] <timotimo> well, bleh(foo, bar) really

[19:34] <timotimo> since the & is not necessary when you're calling a sub

[19:34] <Zoffix> slayergames: &[**] is short for &infix:<**> which is a noun form of the `2 ** 2` verb. The `.` is the method call. So you're using the operator as a method, giving the invocant as the first arg and in the eval above there's also the second arg: the power to raise the invocant into

[19:34] <slayergames> i discovered perl 6 last week, it's really intuitive

[19:35] <Zoffix> slayergames: and ¬ª is a hyper metaop, it hypers that method call over elements of that range, similar to how a map would work

[19:36] <slayergames> is there a tk library for perl 6?

[19:36] <Zoffix> (^20)¬ª.&[**]: 2   =>  (^20)¬ª.&[**](2)  =>   (^20).map(* ** 2)  => (0..19).map(* ** 2)   # this is just equivalent for this case. hyper metaop has extra features like descending into iterables and autothreadin g

[19:36] <timotimo> we don't have tk directly in perl6, but you can get a tk via Inline::Python or Inline::Perl5, or you can use GTK instead of TK

[20:14] <raschipi> timotimo: just saw that video too, but there's no way to represent -1/œÜ in Perl 6. Eventually that sequence will flip and go to œÜ.

[20:15] <raschipi> THe closer you start to -1/œÜ, the more steps it will take, but eventually it will converge to œÜ. It has to be exactly -1/œÜ, which can't be represented.

[20:58] <TimToady> doesn't install on my Linux either, but that's probably becuase there's no symlink from the .so to the .so.0
