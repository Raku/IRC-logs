[04:00] <finanalyst> good morning JJ

[04:00] <jmerelo> finanalyst: hi

[04:00] <yoleaux> 8 Nov 2018 18:01Z <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: Haven't decided yet (though I had many ideas). Any suggestions?

[04:00] <jmerelo> .tell AlexDaniel bitrot again?

[04:00] <yoleaux> jmerelo: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[04:01] <jmerelo> finanalyst: I think $!a might not be available until the TWEAK phase

[04:01] <finanalyst> ah. ok. thanks

[04:01] <lookatme_q> finanalyst, you should use TWEAK

[04:03] <finanalyst> yes I use TWEAK as well. I thought that if has containers could use contents of previously declared has containers, the contents would be available in BUILD. 

[04:03] <lookatme_q> finanalyst, refer this https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Object_construction

[04:08] <finanalyst> lookatme_q: I am carefully reading this page. It is not clear about when initialised has containers become available. 

[04:10] <finanalyst> In section on attributes, in class journey, $.destination references $.origin. BUILD comes after those initialisations, so the assumption I made was that the initialised containers would be available in BUILD. I think this needs to be made explicit in docs.

[14:55] <poohman> Is there a method to check whether a hash has already been initialised??

[14:56] <tobs`> I have an object that generates a very large string that I expect callers to want to deal with line by line. I could gather-take these lines, but I wonder if there is another way to return a string stream of sorts, which the caller can either take as a string or calls .lines on to get the lines as they arrive.

[15:00] <tobs`> but of course, my %h can become empty again after it was once initialized, as seen above.

[15:00] <poohman> I want to know if the value of a hash with a key which will be generated at runtime has been initialised

[15:00] *** abraxxa left
[15:02] <poohman> It was strange - I did not get any  error/warning for a single dimensional hash - but I got a message for a 2 dimensional hash - it continued to run though

[15:03] <poohman> tobs: what is this "so" you have used??

[15:03] <tobs`> Then it sounds like you want the :exists adverb

[15:03] <tobs`> poohman: `so` coerces to Bool

[15:03] <tobs`> this checks if the hash is empty or not

[15:03] <tobs`> but to check if there is a value associated to a key, you use

[15:11] <poohman> what is the difference between %h<my-key> and %h{my-key}???

[15:12] <timotimo> %h<my-key> is the same as %h{'my-key'}

[15:12] <timotimo> in other words it auto-quotes for you

[15:12] <timotimo> and if you have spaces in there, it splits into multiple

[15:12] <timotimo> i.e., %h<foo bar> is the same as %h{'foo', 'bar'}

[15:13] <poohman> and is %h{'foo', 'bar'} the same as %h{'foo'}{ 'bar'}

[15:13] <timotimo> no, that would be %h{'foo'; 'bar'} iirc

[15:14] <timotimo> %h<foo bar> is the same as %h{'foo'}, %h{'bar'}

[15:14] <poohman> ok 

[15:14] <poohman> thanks

[15:14] <lizmat> %h<foo><bar> would be the same as %h{'foo'}{'bar}

[20:06] <nwellnhof> Somewhat releated question...

[20:54] <delon> Any thoughts on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18417829

[20:54] <delon> ?

[20:55] <El_Che> it's a good book?

[20:56] <delon> Sure, I agree

[20:56] <nwellnhof> delon: You should add (1999) to the HN title.

[20:56] <delon> +El_che I was thinking more of the title "Diligence, Patience, and Humility"

[20:57] <delon> +nwellnhof will do

[21:03] <delon> +timotimo There's been so much progress lately, it's been a tough ride, I'm sure

[21:04] <delon> I just thought maybe the essay would be helpful, I remember being WOW'd by it back in the day
