[10:58] <timotimo> my brain is very, very slow right now

[10:58] <timotimo> does the repo have to be called perl6-advent when it's already under perl6?

[10:59] <jmerelo> timotimo: you can give me the privs if you want so that you don't have to do everything yourself.

[11:01] <timotimo> i'd like that

[11:02] <timotimo> i assume @jjmerelo is you

[11:02] <timotimo> you should have the necessary privs now

[11:03] <jmerelo> right

[11:05] <yoleaux> 06:33Z <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: can you set up the Squashable bot to follow perl6/doc as well as perl6/Pod-To-HTML and perl6/perl6-pod-to-bigpage?

[11:05] <yoleaux> 06:41Z <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: plus perl6/perl6-lwp-simple

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: so what are we going to do?

[11:06] <AlexDaniel> ah, ok

[11:06] <AlexDaniel> docs and tools

[11:06] <AlexDaniel> I see

[11:06] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: \o

[11:07] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: so what's the scope exactly for “tools”? For example, is whateverable included or not?

[11:07] *** harrison left
[11:08] <SmokeMachine> I completely forgot my suggestion of awesome perl6 ... :(

[11:08] <tbrowder> timotimo: feel free to rename it, but i think it’s more self-contained (context-free) as it is

[11:08] *** kurahaupo joined
[11:09] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: we can still do it, can you create a repo with a general structure for the document?

[11:09] <AlexDaniel> and then we can add that repo to the list of tracked repos

[11:09] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[11:09] <tbrowder> i’m just throwing some stuff in off the top of my head to get some di

[11:09] <tbrowder> usable content for new authors

[11:10] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: can you try setting up webhooks yourself? Same instructions: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/wiki/SQUASHathon#module-maintainers

[11:11] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: but the password is squashathondocsntools

[11:11] <AlexDaniel> maybe wait a minute before squashable6 comes back online

[11:11] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: In principle, tools needed for Perl 6 documentation. We can include whateverable if you want, but in principle it would be Perl6 doc and dependencies only

[11:12] <jmerelo> Basically LWP::Simple, pod::to::*

[11:12] *** squashable6 joined
[11:12] <jmerelo> OK, I'l do that right now

[11:12] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I’ll try... but probably will not have enough time... :(

[11:13] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v squashable6

[11:14] <lucasb> tbrowder: thanks for creating the repo!

[11:14] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: só you think it’s ok to create github.com/perl6/awesome?

[11:14] <SmokeMachine> *so

[11:15] <lucasb> I would prefer is someone renamed it to "advent". The repo name shows up in command lines and urls. I personaly prefer short and lowercase names

[11:15] <lucasb> *if someone could rename...

[11:15] <squashable6> Webhook for perl6/perl6-pod-to-bigpage is now active! Anything added dilutes everything else.

[11:16] <squashable6> Webhook for perl6/Pod-To-HTML is now active! Mind your words, they are important.

[11:17] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: ^^^ I just updated the password for perl6/doc

[11:18] <jmerelo> lucasb: done https://github.com/perl6/advent /cc tbrowder timotimo

[11:18] <lucasb> jmerelo: thank you!

[11:19] <jmerelo> lucasb: will you write something in return? ;-)

[11:20] <lucasb> I might :-)

[11:21] <jmerelo> lucasb: you'd better make up your mind soon, the slots are flying... not :-)

[11:22] <jmerelo> lucasb: still 5 slots to fill, and some authors are writing several slots, so if you agreed on writing something that would really help.

[11:23] <jnthn> Maybe I should take a slot near the end and "TBA" it... :)

[11:23] <jmerelo> jnthn: that would be most welcome :-)

[11:23] <jnthn> (I'm happy to write something, just undecided what yet :))

[11:24] <jmerelo> jnthn: the last one is free, if I remember correctly.

[11:24] <jmerelo> tbrowder: did you get the Advent hiliter to work?

[11:26] <tbrowder> not the Acme::* one, but the older script by Zoffix works ok. I’m going to put it in the advent repo under tools

[11:26] <jmerelo> tbrowder: great

[11:27] <jmerelo> tbrowder: you did set up your gist token, right?

[11:28] <tbrowder> yes, and so did the other user who had a failure. did you get Acme::* to work?

[11:29] <jmerelo> tbrowder: no, I didn't. I seem to remember there was some change in Gist behavior, and the problem seems to be in Pastebin::Gist

[11:29] <SmokeMachine> The link https://github.com/perl6/advent/blob/master is broken

[11:30] <jmerelo> It should be this: https://github.com/perl6/advent/

[11:30] <jmerelo> Where's that?

[11:30] <SmokeMachine> At the README

[11:31] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: there's nothing in the source. I think it's a TODO

[11:31] <jmerelo> or NYI

[11:31] <SmokeMachine> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/03P8z6Xh/1543318275.JPG

[11:33] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: Yep, but it's something generated by GitHub. There's no URL in the source.

[11:33] <SmokeMachine> Hum... sorry...

[11:33] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: no problem. I am not sure what to put there, though... 

[11:35] <tbrowder> SmokeMachine: repo is under active dev--filling stuff in now, patience my friend...

[11:36] <jmerelo> tbrowder++

[11:36] <SmokeMachine> tbrowder: I’m sorry... I was just trying to help... :(

[11:36] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: no problem, we know :-)

[11:36] <tbrowder> roger!  thnx...give me a few minutes...

[11:49] <tbrowder> ok, check the advent repo now...

[11:55] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: can we show updates to repo advent here as are doc changes shown?

[12:27] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I don't think so

[12:28] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Is it the same as p6c.org?

[12:28] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: no, which key do you use? https://github.com/JJ.keys

[12:29] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: ah actually, both of them are already there

[12:29] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: ssh [email@hidden.address]
[12:30] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: OK, I'm in.

[12:30] <jmerelo> I guess it will be a matter of rebooting something if there's some problem, right? Nothing more fancy than that...

[12:30] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I think the magic command is `sake kill:squashable`

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: or just open `htop` and kill it from there

[12:31] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: OK, I'll do that.

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: if the server runs out of ram then kill everything that takes too much ram :)

[12:31] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Thanks!

[13:24] <eiro> is there a way to clone a repo via zef ?

[13:24] <eiro> something like zef clone XML::Writer

[13:30] <Xliff_> \o

[13:31] <Xliff_> Is there a better way to write / ( <[0..9A..F]>{3} | <[0..9A..F]>{6} ) /

[13:31] <moritz> it's **3 and **6, fwiw

[13:31] <yoleaux> 26 Nov 2018 13:13Z <jmerelo> moritz: it's more approachable than rakudo. Or pretty much the same.

[13:32] <moritz> there's also a built-in <xdigit> rule, but I guess that also matches lower-case a-f

[13:34] <masak> (<[0..9A..F]> ** 3..6) <?{ $0.chars == 3 | 6 }> /

[13:34] <masak> trying to optimize for not repeating the char group; but a better way might be to use or define a subrule, a la moritz++

[13:58] <AlexDaniel> I'm just surprised that it wasn't mentioned anywhere?

[13:58] <AlexDaniel> initial release 27 Jun 2018

[14:13] <eiro> timotimo, lucasb got it: i expected the "look" subcommand to give me a ready to hack directory

[14:14] <jnthn> eiro: If it's a dist from CPAN, then it just gets a tarball, I guess, so that'd not be ready to hack either :)

[14:15] <eiro> instead, i had to open a web browser to go to packages.perl6.org to find the package, click on it and discover it is a github project. fork it and clone it ...

[14:15] <eiro> i mean come one: who still use a web browser in 2018 ? 

[14:16] <eiro> jnthn, most of the CPAN is read only for me: i want to contribute to the perl6 modules i use so i wnat to go straight to the point i can write code 

[14:17] <eiro> those kind of easy dive can ease contribution

[14:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a82deb6e: OUTPUT: «79␤»

[14:18] <jnthn> eiro: I think there's a META6.json source URL that could more usefully provide where the source is; I think probably trying to overload that onto `look` is less useful though, in that `looks` is for what'd be installed.

[14:18] <timotimo> oh

[14:18] <Xliff_> m: "Hello".substr(0, 2).say

[14:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a82deb6e: OUTPUT: «He␤»

[14:18] <timotimo> "zef info" gives you the source-url immediately

[14:18] <jnthn> Ah, cool

[14:19] <timotimo> let's see how it does for cpan

[14:19] <timotimo> hm. what's on cpan?

[14:19] <timotimo> damn it

[14:20] <SmokeMachine> that would be cool if it worked: /<[0..9A..F]> ** {3|6}/

[14:20] <timotimo> aha, that's better

[14:20] <timotimo> Sparrowdo has the source-url be the tarball from cpan, but it has a Suppord: section with source for the github .git url and bugtracker for the /issues url

[14:20] <timotimo> maybe it'd be a good idea to have a squashathon for that :D

[20:37] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: added a test for curly|square braces|brackets in doc repo

[20:37] <AlexDaniel> oh, nice

[20:40] <Kaiepi> ordered 16gb of ram

[20:40] <Kaiepi> mainly so i can test the jvm in vms properly

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: 16 in total? :)

[20:43] *** zakharyas left
[20:43] <Kaiepi> yeah

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/moarvm?date=2018-11-27#l84

[20:45] <Kaiepi> damn 64gb

[20:45] <Kaiepi> nice

[20:47] * rindolf only has 8 gb here

[20:47] <rindolf> getting low

[20:48] <Kaiepi> 8gb is barely enough for me to be able to build the jvm

[20:49] <Kaiepi> grinds my computer to a halt for half an hour when doing it from scratch

[20:49] <rindolf> https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/faq.html#exceeded_512GB

[20:50] <Kaiepi> i'm guessing degenerate here doesn't mean the same thing as how right-wing people use the word

[20:51] <Kaiepi> We have been able to complete a complete scan of all 4 freecell deals in the MS freecell 8.6 milliard range using an AWS node with only 256 GB of RAM and about 40-50 GB of hard disk (though we could probably use less or make use of s3fs-fuse or similar — to save on costs).

[20:51] <Kaiepi> only 256GB of ram

[20:53] <rindolf> Kaiepi: heh

[20:55] <Xliff_> Is there a suggests section for META6.json? 

[20:55] *** kurahaupo_ left
[20:56] <rindolf> Kaiepi: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/degenerate#Adjective - 4th meaning

[20:56] <Kaiepi> ah

[20:57] <AlexDaniel> :D

[21:00] <Kaiepi> how do you even use that much ram for a freecell solver? do you store each possible solution in ram or something?

[21:06] <rindolf> Kaiepi: yes, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

[21:06] <Kaiepi> ah

[21:07] <rindolf> Kaiepi: well, not solution, but state of the board

[21:11] <[Coke]> I'm accumulating versions of zef. wonder if we should have a prompt/flag to remove old versions of a module when installing the current one.

[23:46] <hahainternet> i've a relatively modern moar i think, but i can't seem to define a sqrt prefix of √ and i'm not quite sure why

[23:46] <hahainternet> (ie sub prefix:<√> etc)

[23:46] <hahainternet> could anyone provide a working example?

[23:50] <timotimo> let's see

[23:50] <AlexDaniel> m: sub prefix:<√>($x) { sqrt $x }; say √2

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d317f277: OUTPUT: «1.4142135623730951␤»

[23:50] <hahainternet> right ok, so something is broken with my setup

[23:50] <AlexDaniel> 6c: sub prefix:<√>($x) { sqrt $x }; say √2

[23:51] <hahainternet> is where i was

[23:51] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: what's the code and which error are you getting?

[23:51] <timotimo> that's just 3 weeks ago

[23:51] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: identical to yours, and it's scrolled off the top now, but Bogus Statement or similar

[23:51] <timotimo> oh

[23:51] <hahainternet> expected a prefix or term i believe

[23:51] <timotimo> you're in the repl?

[23:52] <hahainternet> oh, of course

[23:52] <timotimo> that's the problem :(

[23:52] <hahainternet> yes i remember there being a note about the repl

[23:52] <hahainternet> just slipped my mind, ta!
