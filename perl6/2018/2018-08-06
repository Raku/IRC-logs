[02:11] <MasterDuke> does anyone happen to know if i do a `git describe` on a branch, and then create a PR for that branch and merge it into master, will a `git describe` on master immediately after give the same thing?

[02:12] *** kerframil left
[02:12] *** eliasr left
[02:15] * Zoffix makes a wild guess and says no :)

[02:16] <Zoffix> Was gonna test it with a test repo, but `git describe` don't wanna describe me anything

[02:16] <geekosaur> I would guess not as well; you would need explicit action beyond a PR to get a tag merged that would affect it

[02:17] <geekosaur> (you need a non-lightweight tag)

[02:19] <MasterDuke> hm, i was guessing not also. make syncronizing these three PR's to moarvm, nqp, and rakudo to rename getstrfromname slightly more annoying

[02:20] <Zoffix> How come?

[02:21] <MasterDuke> once the MoarVM one is merged, nqp won't build without its PR, but it also needs a bump (which i can't pre-populate its PR with since i won't know what `git describe` will be in MoarVM after its merge)

[02:22] <MasterDuke> and then same with rakudo

[02:22] <Zoffix> ah

[02:23] <MasterDuke> so i'll just merge the MoarVM one, and then edit the NQP after. and then do the same with rakudo

[02:24] <MasterDuke> i don't see a lot of commits to any of moarvm/nqp/rakudo right now, so it seems like a good time anybody have any objections to me doing what i just described?

[02:25] <MasterDuke> s/time anybody/time. anybody/

[02:27] <Zoffix> MasterDuke: what do you mean by "edit the NQP"?

[02:27] <Zoffix> do you mean just the bumps or something else?

[02:28] <Zoffix> 'cause you can PR all the changes in all three repos and then the person merging the stuff can do the bumps

[02:30] <MasterDuke> there are existing PRs

[02:31] <MasterDuke> i was going to add a bump commit to the NQP PR and then to the Rakudo PR

[02:32] <Zoffix> *phew* done. that was annoying.

[02:44] <MasterDuke> Zoffix: does what i said make sense? if so i'm going to go ahead

[02:46] <Zoffix> except for adding bump commits to PRs. I'm not 100% sure, but I think git describes will not be the same

[02:49] <MasterDuke> it'll be the describe for the upstream repo. the bump commit in the nqp pr would be the git describe of moarvm after its pr is merged. the bump commit in the rakudo pr would be the git describe of nqp after its pr was merged

[02:50] <Zoffix> MasterDuke: if it's after the merge, why not just bump directly and not PR anything?

[02:51] <MasterDuke> could do that. i just thought it would tie it more directly to the PR, since that's the only reason for the bump

[07:20] <atweiden-air> i almost solved this by bundling xxhash src in https://github.com/atweiden/digest-xxhash/commit/93404c06b6cb71acac1ce5f82077730cdf0998f9

[07:20] <atweiden-air> unfortunately it blew up on machines where perl6 was installed system-wide for reasons i still don't completely understand

[07:21] <atweiden-air> i don't intend to add instructions for installing xxhash to my module

[07:22] <atweiden-air> as in all of my other repos, if i have a dep, i link to it, and then it's on the dep repo to 'splain how to install

[07:25] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: I don't think adding instructions to install stuff is going to hurt anyone.

[07:26] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: and anyway zef build . is failing for reasons I can't understand. zef is sometimes LTA when issuing errors. But if all you want is to download a sample file, it's probably better to use curl to download it instead of git clone + checkout

[07:27] <atweiden-air> jmerelo: i solved `zef build` in https://github.com/atweiden/digest-xxhash/commit/93404c06b6cb71acac1ce5f82077730cdf0998f9

[07:28] <atweiden-air> but it had to be reverted because it wasn't finding the native libs on machines where perl6 is installed system-wide

[07:38] *** Khisanth joined
[07:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Khisanth

[07:39] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: I mean in the TXN::* modules.

[07:40] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: I really didn't have much trouble with Digest::xxHash; the only thing that was not obvious was copying the lib files to /usr/lib (which I included as a PR)

[07:41] <atweiden-air> presumably TXN::* mods are failing because libxxhash isn't installing itself automatically. or aren't they?

[07:42] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: no, they are failing because zef build fails to download the sample files that are used in the tests. That's why I said it might be easier to download the files using curl, instead of git + checkout

[07:42] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: or simply including the files in the distro; I don't see a big problem with that either. 

[07:42] <atweiden-air> git is failing, then?

[07:43] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: I really have no idea. I have created the issue, and zef build . simply says there's an error. As said above, zef errors are LTA

[07:44] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: might be it gets fuzzy because of the change in branches, the warning or somethign like that.

[07:45] <atweiden-air> i'll take a look

[07:45] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: thanks!

[07:46] <atweiden-air> just took a look; zef build . worked fine

[07:46] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: well, lucky you. It does not work for me...

[07:48] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: I use an Ubuntu 14.04 server, and zef and Perl6 are the last version available. 

[07:48] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: as indicated in the issue, it just says: !!!> Build failure: .

[07:48] <atweiden-air> oh, i got that error myself before upgrading to zef 0.4.6

[07:48] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: which is incredibly (NOT) helpful. 

[07:48] <atweiden-air> it's because i named the Build file Build.pm6

[07:49] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: zef is latest from rakudobrew

[07:49] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: but let me update it just in case

[07:52] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: OK, it works now with 0.4.6.

[07:53] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: in that case, it would be convenient to indicate that in the README.md. As well as maybe create an issue in zef telling them to issue an error saying "I can't find Build.pm6". I mean, jeez...

[07:54] <jmerelo> atweiden-air: and, anyway, doing a build phase just for including a file for testing is maybe a bit too much. Again, this could be saved if you just included the file in the repo.

[14:46] <Altreus> Can rakudo run perl5 like this FAQ says? https://perl6.org/archive/faq.html

[14:47] <Xliff> Altreus: There is always Inline::Perl5 for that.

[14:48] <Altreus> my colleague says that I don't need both interpreters because perl6 already can do perl5 :P

[14:48] <[Coke]> That's not true.

[14:48] <[Coke]> Even if you're using Inline::Perl5 module, it's still using the Perl 5 you have installed.

[14:50] <stmuk_> Altreus: thats an obsolete faq, the modern one is at https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq.html

[14:50] <Altreus> so I thought!

[14:50] <Altreus> I shall inform him that he is silly

[14:50] <pmurias> Altreus: Rakudo could run a subset of Perl 5 in the past

[14:54] <El_Che> maybe he's not silly, but just old

[14:55] <xinming> Xliff: does it call on DBIish objct directly?

[14:55] <pmurias> .oO(a truffle backend for Perl 5 would be super cool)

[14:55] <Xliff> xinming: Yes. If you are having problems, please post code! :)

[16:58] <donpdonp> strong type checking was half the appeal of perl6 for me. sigh.

[16:58] <timotimo> the docs seem to suggest prefixing the list with an explicit identity value

[16:58] <timotimo> that's clearly not so great

[17:01] <lizmat> zostay++

[17:01] <timotimo> not if you use prefix:<|>, though

[17:01] <timotimo> that's syntax for "put these things into the argument list"

[17:01] <timotimo> you can either [].Slip or slip [] or probably (|[])

[17:02] <donpdonp> [] or (|[]) gives Cannot resolve caller reduce(Array: Block, Array);

[17:02] *** n1ge joined
[17:02] *** n1ge left
[17:02] <timotimo> yeah

[17:03] <timotimo> seems like a version of the reduce method that takes a second argument doesn't exist

[17:04] <timotimo> the sub form can do it, by virtue of taking all the values as positional args anyway

[17:05] <donpdonp> reduce -> $a, $b {say "1 {$a.^name} 2 {$b.^name}";[$b]}, [], |["a","b","c"] -> works as expected. the second param initializes the accumulator. 

[17:05] <timotimo> yup

[17:05] <timotimo> it's equivalent to calling reduce on the list [[], "a", "b", "c"]

[17:05] <timotimo> so it's not really a "initialize the accumulator" argument

[17:07] *** stee3 left

[17:13] *** Zic14 left
[17:13] <timotimo> true.

[17:14] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v nativecallable6

[17:14] <timotimo> what you can do is have a multi sub with two candidates that both have two arguments, but differentiate on the type of the first argument

[17:14] <timotimo> not very elegant, i agree

[17:14] <timotimo> also i'm pretty sure reduce with only one argument must also work, so it'd have to call the one-argument variant if there is one

[17:15] <timotimo> i'm not convinced reduce is currently behaving correctly when a sub with a one-arg multi is passed

[17:15] <timotimo> or perhaps it only does it if there's a 0 arg multi?

[17:15] <timotimo> m: multi sub reduc() { say "zero-arg"; [] }; multi sub reduc($a, $b) { say "two-arg"; [$a.Slip, $b] }; <a b c d>.reduce(&reduc).say

[17:35] <zostay> I usually end up using $.map().join() when converting an array of objects to string.

[17:35] <timotimo> the actual use case donpdonp has is much different from making a string, i believe

[17:35] <timotimo> it was just a simplified example

[17:36] <donpdonp> the input was fancy (xml elements) but the output was actually a string :)

[17:36] <timotimo> oh, OK!

[17:36] <donpdonp> b2gills: that works but reduce was made to eliminate an 'external' accumulator 

[17:38] <donpdonp> i move the reduce into its own sub and im back to oddball errors.

[17:40] <donpdonp> i try  a regex stop-gap to take out html tags, ruby:  "<p>hi".gsub(/\<[^\>]+\>/,'') => "hi", perl6:  "<p>hi".subst(/\<[^\>]+\>/,'') => "<p>hi"

[18:01] *** jmerelo left
[18:02] <timotimo> putting m:g/ / into the first arg of subst will first run the match on $_, which is how m// works, and then try to use the result as a string to search for for the subst

[18:03] <timotimo> the result of the match is "ab" from $_, then it replaces "ab" with "foo" in the "ababab" string

[18:36] <timotimo> what did i deserve to get such a warm greeting :)

[18:36] <timotimo> did i do to deserve*

[18:39] <xinming> What is the best way to alias a method in perl6?

[18:40] <xinming> something like *sub = \&another_name in perl5

[18:40] <timotimo> depends, that doesn't transfer the "self" over, right?

[18:40] *** lex joined
[18:41] <xinming> timotimo: It does

[18:41] <xinming> alias method, not alias sub

[18:41] <xinming> method aliasd-name () { self.old-method }

[18:41] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lex

[18:41] <timotimo> that is the best way we have without a module, i think?

[18:42] <jnthn> Given the optimizer inlines, it's not actually so bad (except the typing) to just install another method that delegates

[18:42] <xinming> this is not the best one I can think of, since it doesn't handle the signature

[18:42] <timotimo> i thought you wanted to pass around "sub" and later call it

[18:42] <jnthn> The alternative is to use the MOP

[18:45] <jnthn> Not sure I can imagine a solution involving ::= working for a method alias anyway

[18:45] <jnthn> They have to end up in the methods table in the meta-object, which is completely unrelated to what happens to be in a package.

[19:35] <geekosaur> regex works differently in perl 6

[19:35] <benjikun> yeah the {} part isn't right in perl6, I believe

[19:35] <geekosaur> it is not the same as the regex you may know from elsewhere

[19:35] <benjikun> also shouldn't [0-7] be [0..7]

[19:35] <geekosaur> nor the [] which is a noncapturing group, not a charlass

[19:35] *** pppingme22 left
[19:35] <Juerd> benjikun: <[0..7]>

[19:35] <geekosaur> <['0'..'7']>

[19:35] <geekosaur> and yes, quotes are probably optional there

[19:36] <benjikun> Yea

[19:36] <lindylex> my $o1 = "abcd1051710EFGHI3928920" ~~ / ( [0..7]**7 ) /;   This does not work

[19:36] <geekosaur> and the `{7,}` is `** (7..*)`

[19:37] <geekosaur> and I see you paid no attention to the earlier discussion

[19:37] <tobs> m: say "abcd1051710EFGHI3928920" ~~ / <[0..7]> ** 7..* /;

[19:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3a871256: OUTPUT: «｢1051710｣␤»

[19:38] <lindylex> I though the parenthesis are what tested positive so I can access them from the variable $0 for the first that tested positive.  

[19:39] <geekosaur> yes, if you want to caapture, you need parentheses

[19:39] <geekosaur> [] is not a character class, <[ ]> is

[19:39] <lindylex> Oh I see <[ ]> this is the charactewr class.

[19:39] <geekosaur> the <> around it is not optional. [ ... ] is a non-capturing group (spelled (?: ... ) in older regex)

[19:40] <benjikun> we should have an intro to regexes in docs

[19:40] <geekosaur> there is one, I think

[19:40] <lindylex> Like this my $o1 = "abcd1051710EFGHI3928920" ~~ / ( <[0..7]> )**7  /; 

[19:40] <benjikun> really?

[19:40] <geekosaur> but people see 'regex' and assume whatever regex they've seen before

[19:40] <benjikun> there is a grammar tutorial

[19:40] <moritz> there's also a whole book on the subject :-)

[19:40] <yoleaux> 02:55Z <Zoffix> moritz: I added info for how to manage certs for perl6.org domains, including setting up a new one. Would you review/correct it? https://github.com/perl6/infrastructure-doc/commit/73a6c0ae83c5ea1e8a499b61d85c3673bca0bdb1

[19:40] <yoleaux> 02:56Z <Zoffix> moritz: oh, and if the steps are wrong, then we'll need to fix the new marketing.perl6.org domain, because those are the steps that I followed for it

[19:40] <geekosaur> they dont even get posix vs. pcre vs. whateber right

[19:40] <benjikun> I don't think there is an actual intro to regex in docs for p6

[19:40] <benjikun> there is a pod somewhere and there is a grammar tutorial

[19:40] <geekosaur> everyone knows there is exactly one kind of regex and it has been around sin ce 1970

[19:41] <geekosaur> never ind that there's like 30 different regex variabts including *two* POSIX variants

[19:42] <benjikun> I've avoided using regexes as much as possible in perl6

[19:42] <geekosaur> I like p6 regex

[19:42] <benjikun> because I've been warned they are still slow atm

[19:42] <geekosaur> especially since the kind of regexes I end up using in p5 are ... well, I use /x for one of them and it's 15 lines

[19:43] <benjikun> lol

[19:43] <geekosaur> and still inscrutable unless you're me (luckily this is not going to be distributed)

[19:44] <geekosaur> anyway, they can still be slow, yes, but they do a lot more and are a lot cleaner than old-style regex

[19:49] <moritz> basically with named regexes you can define full recursive-descent parsers that use the regexes as tokenizers

[19:50] <moritz> https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/

[19:50] <benjikun> moritz: Are you still going to work on SVG::Plot

[19:50] <lindylex> geekosaur, and benjikun thanks for the help.

[21:01] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: the shop will probably charge you about ~10¢ more per page for A4 instead of US Letter

[21:01] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: what do you mean permanent as licensed?

[21:01] <Zoffix> We can use them many times, after we buy them, if that's what you're asking

[21:02] <tbrowder_> I mean are the ones on the site now permanent, and they can be used as their license states.

[21:04] <tbrowder_> ok, that works. if we need YUGE quantities and more fees to meet needs that’s a good thing!

[21:04] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: and the other negative about having multiple sizes is we'd have to duplicate changes on all the versions. And I know Mark Keating wanted to do some changes to that brochure.

[21:05] <benjikun> :p

[21:05] <tbrowder_> i understand, but if Mark does his master right changes shouldn’t be too hard. is mark using version control?

[21:06] <tbrowder_> PostScript can be scripted...

[21:30] <Altreus> I'm not sure what Proc.sink is for

[21:30] <Altreus> It says a sunk Proc will throw if the command dies, so I have to assume that the shell subroutine returns a sunk Proc

[21:31] <Altreus> since the program dies if the shell command fails

[21:31] <moritz> it returns a Proc

[21:31] <moritz> and if you discard the result, it is sunk

[21:32] <Altreus> so storing the proc means it is not sunk

[21:32] <Altreus> unless I sink it

[21:32] <moritz> correct

[21:32] <Altreus> ah is this the term equivalent to P5's void context?

[21:34] <moritz> yes

[21:34] <El_Che> it sounds more ordinary than The Void 

[21:35] <moritz> Void, Call Of The

[21:36] <Altreus> $void()

[21:36] <El_Che> if you call wantarray() in a row, the Void appears

[21:41] <Xliff> $void.stare-back if $void.staring-into

[23:13] <SmokeMachine> this works:
