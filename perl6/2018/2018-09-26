[00:19] <Zoffix> vrurg: because whatever doesn't close over the `~~`

[00:20] <Zoffix> So the difference is the first one is like `{ *.all ~~ Str }`  I think there's a ticket somewhere to detect and complain about that case

[00:20] <Zoffix> m: sub foo( *@v where .all ~~ Str ) { note "ok" }; foo( |<a b c> )

[00:20] <buggable> Zoffix, WhereList 'Simpler `where` constraints for items of lists': http://modules.perl6.org/dist/WhereList:github:Zoffix%20Znet

[00:21] <Zoffix> Ticket is R#2086

[00:21] <synopsebot> R#2086 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2086 [LTA][RFC] Maybe warn when thunking `*.foo ~~ $bar` constructs?

[00:21] <vrurg> Zoffix: Thanks! 

[00:22] <vrurg> I would agree with the ticket: a warning would be helpful here. .all is perfectly ok with me. Though sub foo( Str *@v ) { ... } would do even better! ;)

[00:22] <TimToady> m: say *.all ~~ WhateverCode

[00:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[00:22] <TimToady> that also wants to work

[00:22] <TimToady> and you can't have both

[00:23] <Zoffix> But that's not a thunk, is it?

[00:24] <TimToady> sure it is, but * isn't a parameter for it

[00:24] <TimToady> well, depends on how you define thunk, I guess

[00:24] <TimToady> I can see calling it not-a-thunk too

[00:25] <Zoffix> I mean were's not creating a thunk whose body is `*.all ~~ WhateverCode`

[00:25] <TimToady> right

[00:25] *** kerframil left
[00:25] <TimToady> there's no deferred execution from the ~~

[00:25] <TimToady> the deferred execution is due to the where, which does make it a thunk

[00:25] *** noobst_ joined
[00:26] <TimToady> just as && and || thunkify their right sides

[00:26] <Zoffix> So we can add a warning to the thunk-making in `where` clauses to warn if we see we're trying to thunk a QAST for `*.foo ~~ bar`

[00:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v noobst_

[00:26] <Zoffix> m: 42 andthen *.all ~~ WhateverCode andthen .say

[00:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[00:26] <Zoffix> I guess not here tho, 

[00:27] <Zoffix> oh wait, yeah here too

[00:27] <TimToady> sometimes it's okay to warn about things that are almost certainly wrong but could conceivably be intended

[00:28] <TimToady> when I do that, I'm always careful to mention a way to disable the warning

[00:28] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:28] <TimToady> but yeah, it's like the double closure warning

[00:29] <TimToady> m: my $x = { *.abs == 42 }

[00:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed double closure; WhateverCode is already a closure without curlies, so either remove the curlies or use valid parameter syntax instead of *␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my $x = { *.abs == 42 }7⏏…»

[00:29] <Zoffix> yeah

[00:29] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[00:29] <TimToady> so there's some prior art there

[00:30] *** noobst_ left
[00:30] <Zoffix> Success: I built 2018.06 on Win10 and it works fine for me. Garbage print on default prompt. Proper output after setting chcp 65001 mode.

[00:30] <TimToady> in fact, I see that we make that one fatal

[00:31] <Zoffix> Success: I actually seen that error recently when doing something with `.close` and the code did not have any concurrency in it, so perhaps there is some compiler bug lurking in there.

[00:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v someplace16

[00:35] <vrurg> While I'm digesting the info about thunking... What eventually breaks thunking in my example: .all or ~~? My guess is .all.

[00:36] *** someplace16 left
[00:37] <vrurg> m: sub foo( *@v where * ~~ Str ) { note "ok" }; foo( |<a b c> )

[00:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '@v'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Array ($["a", "b", "c"])␤  in sub foo at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:37] <vrurg> Ok, its clearly .all

[00:38] <TimToady> * is not a thunk, so I don't know what you mean by "breaking"

[00:39] *** dracosilv8 joined
[00:39] <TimToady> also, Whatever is treated differently from WhateverCode

[00:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dracosilv8

[00:40] <TimToady> m: say (* ~~ Str)("")

[00:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[00:40] <TimToady> m: say (*.self ~~ Str)("")

[00:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Bool'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:41] <TimToady> m: say (*.self ~~ WhateverCode)

[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[00:41] <TimToady> m: say (* ~~ Whatever)

[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «{ ... }␤»

[00:41] <TimToady> m: say (* ~~ Whatever)()

[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «Too few positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 0␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:41] <TimToady> m: say (* ~~ Whatever)(*)

[00:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[00:42] *** dracosilv8 left
[00:42] <TimToady> so * "works" directly on the left side of ~~, but not via WhateverCode

[00:43] <TimToady> you only get one level as currently spec'ed

[00:44] <TimToady> it's just one of those spots where a WAT is hidden behind several DWiMs

[00:46] <vrurg> Another concept to fit into my brain... TimToady, thanks for explanation! Could you, please, point me at the spec? I definitely need to understand these things by knowelege, not intuition.

[00:47] <vrurg> Or is it a precedence thing?

[00:56] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[00:58] <Zoffix> `*` is "Whatever" in those comments, and an already-closurised thing is a "WhateverCode". So, for example in `*.uc.lc` => `*` Whatever => the `.uc` is a `callmethod` op, and so we make a WhateverCode => we now get to `.lc`, since `callmethod` op is level `3` in that list, we continue closing over it and make `{.uc.lc}`-equivalent closure (without the new scope). But `&infix:<~~>` is level 1, so with `*.all ~~

[00:58] <Zoffix> Blah` => `.all` is callmethod op, we curry it => we get to `~~` op with WhateverCode in hands, and since `~~` is level 1, we don't curry anymore. But with `* ~~ Blah` we have a Whatever, not WhateverCode, on LHS, so we do curry the level 1 `~~` op

[06:40] <ToddAndmargo> Question: is `Str:D $input:` written correctly?  I have only seen it writter as `Str:D:` before.

[06:43] *** committable6 left
[06:43] <El_Che> I don't use that in my signatures :)

[06:43] <TimToady> but sure, that's fine if you want to name the invocant something other than 'self'

[06:44] <El_Che> type and a default is good enough for me 

[06:44] <TimToady> it's just a normal parameter, which can have a type and a variable name

[06:44] <TimToady> it's only the : at the end that magically makes it an invocant

[06:44] *** committable6 joined
[06:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v committable6

[06:45] <ToddAndmargo> So the writer is using the `$input` name in `multi method words(Str:D $input: $limit = Inf --> Positional)` to make it more readable?  If so, it worked

[13:35] <Zoffix> .tell cognominal-p6 in the sub, you're defining an `only`, but in the op you're defining a `multi`. Native types don't get auto-unboxed in multi dispatch, so you either need to give it a native `str` as argument or change to take a Str arguemnt or define a second multi that takes a `Str` argument. m: multi infix:<~~~>(@t, str $s where $s.chars == 3 ) { say 3 }; ['a', 'b'] ~~~ my str $ = '(,)'

[13:35] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to cognominal-p6.

[13:37] <Zoffix> hmmm

[13:38] * Zoffix tries to remember what the deal is with literals, but now I think that was for auto-unboxing into `only` subs.

[15:03] <randc> I have been looking into changing my comments to Pod documentation, but poking around other random modules it looks like the convention is to write all the Pod either before or after the code. Is there a way to do it inline... kind of like "javadoc comments" so I am not writing code comments & separate documentation comments?

[15:10] *** galls joined
[15:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v galls

[15:14] *** galls left
[15:15] <geekosaur> it's just convention. interleaving can have its own problems, mostly with respect to comprehension / breaking things up too much for readers

[15:18] <geekosaur> and usually the kind of comments you put inline like that want to be API documntation or code explanations, not necessarily end user /manual page

[15:19] <jmerelo> randc: Yep, Perl6 has got several brief ways of doing that: https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Multi-line_/_embedded_comments

[15:20] <jmerelo> randc: and it's better than javadoc, because you only need perl6 to produce the text.

[18:55] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/cf116bb50e

[18:55] <erana_> those 3 I am going to start with

[18:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ds_17

[18:56] <erana_> for google : Hidden MArkov Model, forward backwrad pass

[18:57] <erana_> in Shapeir on htp:://shameen.ddns.net you find objc code of the first 30 pages

[18:57] *** Grum18 joined
[18:57] <erana_> 2800+ lines for just exponential landscape engines and the classes need for them

[18:58] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Grum18

[18:58] <erana_> you strip a landscape in 3D coordinates then exponentially distribute them and you truncate on a rambo game I ant to make

[18:58] <erana_> X and Y

[18:58] <erana_> thus the soldier moves on one line

[18:59] <erana_> then shoots from time to time

[18:59] <erana_> ith the landscape and chance  calcs

[19:00] <erana_> per landscape, you sitch the behaviour

[19:02] <erana_> it works here

[19:02] <erana_> no secure line ?

[19:02] <[Coke]> connection refused here, 80 & 443

[19:02] <erana_> it should connect on 80

[19:03] <erana_> could you interrogate the ddns dns ?

[19:03] <[Coke]> get "no route to host" elsewhere.

[19:03] <[Coke]> 217.136.35.

[19:03] <[Coke]> 217.136.35.152

[19:03] <erana_> connect to my ip then

[19:04] <erana_> port 80

[19:04] *** crazik6 left
[19:06] *** sotona left
[19:06] <erana_> 217.136.35.152

[19:06] <erana_> right

[19:06] <[Coke]> if I'm getting connection refused & no route to host, I'm not clear on how using the IP instead of the host will help. (didn't help)

[19:06] <[Coke]> erana_: who are you working with at the TPF?

[19:07] <erana_> the brussels perl mongers company in cooperation with a VUB ex-professr, ex-vice-rector

[19:08] <erana_> it's called ISIS I believe

[19:08] *** Failure left
[19:08] <[Coke]> ah, that's not TPF, then, that's just the local PM group.

[19:10] <erana_> I've made some sound software too

[19:10] <TimToady> where do you know larry from?

[19:11] <[Coke]> as far as I know, TPF isn't funding anything like that right now. Just want to make sure someone didn't misrepresent themselves as the TPF to you.

[19:11] <erana_> talking with him, he admins my server

[19:13] <TimToady> I don't think larry admins that server...

[19:13] <erana_> sure he does, I just manage the uplink

[19:15] <TimToady> just to be clear, since "larry" is ambiguous here, you're saying larry wall admins you're server?

[19:16] <TimToady> where does he log in from?

[19:19] <erana_> And he has 4 daughters, I have 2

[19:19] <TimToady> hey, what else do you know about larry?  we're curious to find out what else you know about him...

[19:19] <Zoffix> Well, I hope I'll get to talk to him one day :)

[19:20] <Zoffix> I thought he's in America somewhere?

[19:20] <TimToady> I've been to one or two

[19:20] <Zoffix> :)

[19:21] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v davidv7

[19:21] <moritz> I've met that Larry guy in Pisa and Riga, iirc

[19:21] <timotimo> TimToady: if you ever meet him, maybe tell us a bit about what he's like

[19:21] <TimToady> well, I have met him, but I can't claim to understand him

[19:21] <erana_> I don't mail to him, we just talk over the wire

[19:22] <timotimo> "over the wire" sounds so curious

[19:22] <moritz> TimToady: understanding is a tall order for any human, let alone a Larry :)

[19:22] * TimToady wonders how many Larry Walls there actually are in America...

[19:22] <timotimo> i imagine it'd have meant using the telephone just a "few" years ago

[19:22] <TimToady> erana_: how do you know it's the real Larry Wall and not some other Larry Wall?

[19:23] <erana_> well, he do can admin my machine :-)

[19:23] <erana_> I have loads of crackers to deal with :-)

[19:24] *** davidv7 left
[19:24] <timotimo> mhhh salty crackers

[19:24] <erana_> lol

[19:25] <erana_> I am going to port the whole perl thing to the Amigas of these days

[19:25] <tadzik> oh boy, is it Hug o'clock?

[19:25] <sena_kun> exactly. :]

[19:25] <erana_> then see what SDL-perl will look like

[19:25] *** pmurias left
[19:26] <TimToady> well, personally, I think you should probably do a traceroute on him to find out which Larry Wall he really is, because I have a slight suspicion that your Larry is not our Larry

[19:27] *** Kiruwa_ joined
[19:27] <tadzik> if he deals with crackers on your server maybe that's Fire Wall

[19:29] *** foxhunt_away14 joined
[19:29] <Zoffix> plottwist: our larry isn't the real Larry :)

[19:29] <diakopter> [Coke]: isn't there a Perl Foundation of Europe that's separate?

[19:29] <Zoffix> erana_: one of the people you've spoke to here so far is The Larry Wall.

[19:29] <timotimo> this larry was made for you and me

[19:30] *** pecastro joined
[19:30] <tadzik> oooh

[19:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v foxhunt_away14

[19:30] <tadzik> now it's like a murder mystery!

[19:30] <moritz> Zoffix: well, if there are clones, I insist that all of them be considered The Real Larry

[19:30] <tadzik> He could be in this very room!

[19:30] <erana_> ah

[19:30] * TimToady should go eat lunch now...

[19:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[19:31] <erana_> so diakopter is Larry ?

[19:31] <moritz> let's all eat a [Larry the ]cucumber, shall we?

[19:31] <Zoffix> erana_: yup

[19:31] <diakopter> *cries

[19:31] <tadzik> we have to play the Guess Who thing

[19:31] <moritz> or maybe not? hard to tell

[19:31] <erana_> well, I think I owe an apology

[19:31] <diakopter> erana_: no, TimToady is.. it's a pun on TIMTOWTDI

[19:31] <erana_> ok

[19:31] <moritz> we're all a big collective, and our personalities sometimes smear out a bit :)

[19:32] <erana_> that's a point

[19:32] <Zoffix> erana_: what kind of apology?

[19:32] <diakopter> it's just the toadying of TimToady varies dramatically from time to time

[19:32] <timotimo> "guess who" reminds me of that piece that combines a snippet from the burger scene of Pulp Fiction with a photo of two people playing "guess who" and one of them has samuel l jacksons head photoshopped onto his shoulders

[19:32] <erana_> well he doesn't accept my mails

[19:33] <Zoffix> Ah :)

[19:33] *** fhats28 joined

[19:33] <tadzik> timotimo: yes, I didn't want to quote it here :P

[19:33] <tadzik> but same thing came to my mind

[19:33] <timotimo> it uses, unsurprisingly, quite unsavoury language

[19:33] <timotimo> do they speak english in #what?

[19:36] <Demos[m]> any guidence on when to use roles vs inheratance?

[19:37] <moritz> Demos[m]: prefer roles whenever possible

[19:37] <timotimo> Demos[m]: the perl6 denizens tend to suggest roles for code re-use and inheritance for liskov-y things

[19:37] <Zoffix> Liskov-y being: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle

[19:37] <[Coke]> diakopter: not to my knowledge.

[19:37] <timotimo> i.e. if one thing is supposed to always be valid when the other also is, inheritance can be better

[19:37] <Demos[m]> hmm OK

[19:38] *** andyrock15 joined
[19:38] *** trqx24 joined
[19:38] *** alexandre909921 joined
[19:38] <Demos[m]> from reading the docs it seems the main difference is that roles have better checks for insanity

[19:38] <moritz> aye

[19:38] <timotimo> yes, it sometimes forces you to disambiguate

[19:38] <moritz> and they can be parameterized (but don't exagerate that)

[19:38] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v andyrock15

[19:38] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v trqx24

[19:38] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v alexandre909921

[19:39] *** alexandre909921 left

[19:43] *** trqx24 left
[19:43] <Demos[m]> I guess I've always seen inhearatance and composition as pretty much the same, just from working in C a bunch.

[19:44] <Demos[m]> is there a concrete diference in how the object ends up looking?

[19:44] <moritz> the philosophy behind Perl 6 is more like "inheritance? sure, we can do that", and less like "YOU SHOULDN'T USE INHERITANCE!!!"

[19:44] <Demos[m]> in memory/in the low level representation or whatever

[19:55] *** pmurias left
[19:55] <Demos[m]> hehe

[19:55] <Demos[m]> so, do non-multi methods still use the same dispatch mechanisms as multis or is there a seperate vtbl

[19:56] *** TheCycoONE26 left
[19:56] *** pmurias joined
[19:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[19:57] <Demos[m]> hm so one difference seems to be if I have roles that use other roles they can't have methods named the same as those other roles, which is probably a good thing

[19:58] <leont> You should think of the method dispatching as a two stage process

[19:58] <leont> First it finds the proto in the class, and then that delegates to the multis in that class

[20:15] <cognominal-p6> zoffix++ for his answer on multis.

[20:15] <yoleaux> 13:35Z <Zoffix> cognominal-p6: in the sub, you're defining an `only`, but in the op you're defining a `multi`. Native types don't get auto-unboxed in multi dispatch, so you either need to give it a native `str` as argument or change to take a Str arguemnt or define a second multi that takes a `Str` argument. m: multi infix:<~~~>(@t, str $s where $s.chars == 3 ) { say 3 }; ['a', 'b'] ~~~ my str $ = '(,)'

[20:15] *** psychoslave left
[20:19] *** rindolf joined
[20:20] <Demos[m]> question on mixins: if I mix in a role that "does" another role that's already on the target object what's supposed to happen

[20:20] <Demos[m]> in my code it seems a new role gets mixed in

[20:20] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v rindolf

[20:27] *** sena_kun left
[20:28] *** insurgent_ left
[20:29] <jnthn> Demos[m]: A runtime mixin effectively creates an anonymous subclass, composes the role in to that, and then changes the type of the object to that new anonymous type

[20:29] <jnthn> Demos[m]: It's entirely possible to implement "the same" role at multiple levels of the inheritance tree

[20:30] <Demos[m]> so I probably want any shared state to be a real base class (with is)?

[20:30] <jnthn> Demos[m]: (Reason for "the same" is because roles are generic on the type they are composed in to, so actually what's composed is a concretization of the role)

[20:31] <jnthn> Yes, if you have `role R { has $!state }; class C does R { }; class D is C does R { }` then you'd have a $!state in C and in D

[20:33] *** Asandari4 joined
[20:33] <Demos[m]> but if I have `role R { has $state }; role X does R {}; class C does R {}; my $c = C.new(); $c does X?

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar ddb5f8fc4: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing required term after infix␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3say qp/foo/7⏏5<EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        prefix␤        term␤»

[21:58] <jnthn> I think that was once speculated, but it didn't happen (yet :))

[21:58] <timotimo> i'd assume it'd be pretty easy, maybe take :chomp as a template for "how to add some post-processing code to the string processing"

[21:58] <jnthn> It's only one letter shorter than "...".IO though :)

[22:00] <timotimo> jnthn: how likely would you enjoy information from the logged data to show up in the "Before" and/or "After" parts of the bytecode dump as well?

[22:01] <jnthn> timotimo: Not quite sure I follow...you mean from the plan?

[22:02] <timotimo> some indication inline to the code where logged data was used or maybe where it couldn't be used

[22:03] <timotimo> basically transplanting some data from the log section to the "Annotation: Logged" parts

[22:06] <jnthn> timotimo: I'm not immediately sure I've missed having that

[22:07] <jnthn> Though could try it of course and see how it looks

[22:07] <timotimo> or just a little vim macro/function/whatever that jumps right from the code to the latest log data :)

[22:07] <timotimo> maybe open it in a split window, even

[22:07] <samcv> timotimo: lol @ " (but people who know them well enough, they are just horrible)

[22:08] <leont> and utf-16 is probably worst outside of email that's still in common use

[22:09] <leont> I mean, it has all the disadvantages of utf-8, all of the disadvantages of UCS-2, and then a new unique disadvantage that binary sort != codepoint sort

[22:09] <jnthn> samcv++ # great post

[22:09] <Demos[m]> wowah what's this community stuff?

[22:09] <Demos[m]> some matrix magic?

[22:10] <timotimo> i know not what you speak of, so it probably has something to do with matrix

[22:15] <samcv> jnthn: thanks :) glad you liked it

[22:17] <Demos[m]> yay! perl makes symlinks on windows with SYMBOLIC_LINK_FLAG_ALLOW_UNPRIVILEGED_CREATE

[22:19] <Demos[m]> speaking of: How do I get the target of a symlink

[22:19] <Demos[m]> on windows

[22:20] <Demos[m]> and how can I tell if a path is a file symlink, a directory symlink or a junction

[22:20] <timotimo> did you look at the single-letter methods on IO::Path?

[22:20] <timotimo> those map to stat, but i'm not sure if everything's in there

[22:21] <Demos[m]> erm... about stat

[22:23] <Demos[m]> the MSDN docs are unclear about how stat works in this case?

[22:24] <Demos[m]> it's also not clear how windows _stat actually deals with ACLs

[22:31] <timotimo> perl6 tends to not put very OS-specific things into the language, like windows ACLs or linux filesystem extended attributes or something

[22:31] <timotimo> that'd be something for modulespace

[22:31] <timotimo> and a couple of modules for windows stuff would surely be welcome

[22:49] <Demos[m]> Makes sense. I’m also thinking about how gobject introspection would work. Can you write custom reprs?

[22:50] <timotimo> you can, indeed, but you may not have to

[22:50] <timotimo> since you can just construct classes at run-time, for example of the CStruct repr

[23:00] <leont> I'm not sure you need much of a custom repr, I though there were accessors and constructors for everything.

[23:07] <Demos[m]> The one thing is gtk’s class init. Which is super important to support composite widget templates

[23:08] <Demos[m]> Also for trying to export gir, but that’s a huge amount of work
