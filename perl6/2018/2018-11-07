[02:25] <Xliff> Can someone tell me the best way to pass a function to a C-Callback?

[02:26] <Xliff> method some_meth (&some_func (Type1, Type2, Type3)) seems like it should work, but doesn't.

[12:27] <lucasb> AlexDaniel: agreed, thanks for the advice :)

[12:27] <lizmat> AlexDaniel++

[12:27] <lucasb> so much passion

[12:29] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: as for the wiki, I think it is needed (there were a couple of cases in the past). Right now stuff ends up here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki

[12:29] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: there's an interesting question as to which wiki engine should be used :)

[12:30] <lucasb> MediaWiki, otherwise don't even bother :)

[12:30] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: I mean, surely there are many great ones, but we love dogfooding, right?

[12:30] <lucasb> perl 5 had an SocialText wiki, it didn't worked

[12:30] <lucasb> nobody was familiar with the interface. everybody knows wikipedia

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> perl5 also has oddmuse, and there's now oddmuse written in perl 6 https://github.com/kensanata/oddmuse6

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> it's in very early stages, so kinda not ready

[12:31] <lucasb> I understand that. (Oddmuse (5) user myself :)

[12:32] <lucasb> But I still think MediaWiki is the most appropriate one and robust for this situation

[12:32] <lucasb> My idea is that only registered users would be able to edit pages. This avoid the spam/vandalism problem, right?

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: yeah, maybe. I'm not insisting on anything, just listing the options :)

[12:34] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: I dislike wikis that can't be edited without going through all the hoops to get your account ready… I just end up not contributing at all…

[12:34] <AlexDaniel> but it depends on what purposes we want to use it for

[12:34] <AlexDaniel> maybe using github accounts is possible? Like through OAuth apps or what is it called? I'm not sure

[12:35] <AlexDaniel> this: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OAuth2_Client

[12:38] <lucasb> Well, if you are an P6 enthusiast, you only need to register an account once, and enjoy later. I think it's a good tradeoff to not have to deal with outside people disrupting the wiki

[12:40] <AlexDaniel> yeah, but then we're missing out on microcontributions

[12:41] <AlexDaniel> with MediaWiki I'm pretty sure we can have very fine control over privileges and stuff, so that important pages are not disrupted

[12:41] <lucasb> right, maybe it should start open and only get restricted if we face problems

[12:42] <lucasb> needs an Apache server, PHP/MySQL instance. where would this run? in the p6c hack machine?

[12:43] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: here's a repo that is related: https://github.com/perl6/infrastructure-doc

[12:43] <holyghost> AFAIK the wikie syntax matters

[12:47] <lucasb> yes. I rememebered I had already populated an MediaWiki wiki with P6 content. I'll see if I can ressurect it

[12:47] <holyghost> AlexDaniel: The wiki syntax in editing your browser should be straightforward

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> holyghost: yeah, but that's the point of that extension

[12:48] <holyghost> AlexDaniel: else you have to go to the help file

[12:48] <lucasb> if Mediaw

[12:48] <holyghost> FWIW

[12:48] <holyghost> Don't turn in P6 just for wiki

[12:48] <lucasb> if MediaWiki is chosen, then I think we should start with the standard MediaWiki syntax, and add anything later

[12:49] <holyghost> You have to manage your users

[12:49] <holyghost> AlexDaniel: I cannot lookup the extension here

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: I… I don't know… can't we try that markdown extension first?

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> personally I don't know mediawiki syntax, even though I've been wiki-ing a lot…

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> that “I don't know” lines up vertically :D

[12:58] <lucasb> although I like the idea of a git-backed wiki for my own personal usage, but not for a big open source project

[12:59] <holyghost> true

[13:01] <holyghost> To be honest, we need some hackers for the wikiweb imp.

[13:03] <holyghost> smite it on a public repo and then we can follow

[13:04] <holyghost> As I said, *turn on* your wiki syntax

[17:28] <El_Che> stmuk_: for max 6 months, sure.

[17:29] <Altreus> so I should be able to do $a = $a.lc.trim ~~ S///

[17:29] <Altreus> Correct? :s

[17:29] <El_Che> stmuk_: how is star coming along. We've had sole questions last week

[17:30] <timotimo> that will not do what you hope for, Altreus 

[17:30] <El_Che> some

[17:30] <timotimo> it'll take the result of the S/// and smartmatch it against the LHS, though it will set the LHS as the $_ of the RHS

[17:30] <El_Che> tablet typing sucks

[17:30] <timotimo> so essentially it'll result in False, unless the substitution did nothing in which case it would result in True

[17:32] <Altreus> Is that because LHS of ~~ is not a variable?

[17:32] <Altreus> not bindable, or some similar concept?

[17:32] <timotimo> no, it's because S/// is an operator that immediately does something

[17:33] <Altreus> But I thought it did it to the LHS of ~~

[17:33] <Altreus> otherwise surely it can only ever apply to $_

[17:33] <tony-o> lizmat++

[17:33] <Altreus> which is not true of lowercase s///

[17:33] <tony-o> just read the blog 

[17:34] *** scimon left
[17:36] <Altreus> See

[17:36] <Altreus> I told this non-programmer chap that in Perl6 we'd use ~~ instead of the .subst method

[17:36] <Altreus> But now I'm thinking maybe not

[17:37] <Altreus> I was like why use a method when there's an operator

[17:37] <timotimo> i notice that i'm confused

[17:37] <timotimo> i don't have a good explanation for why S/// and s/// behave so differently

[17:37] <Altreus> tsuyoki naritai? did I get that right

[17:38] <timotimo> paamayim nekudotayim

[17:38] <Altreus> I did PHP for 4 years. You'll have to try harder than that.

[17:39] <timotimo> i was not familiar with your term until now

[17:39] <moritz> timotimo: the explanation has to do with smart-matching

[17:39] <timotimo> moritz: s/// on its own also operates immediately, doesn't it?

[17:39] <moritz> timotimo: it does

[17:39] <timotimo> so the ACCEPTS method is called on the result of that, right?

[17:40] <moritz> yes

[17:40] <moritz> but s/// can just return True

[17:40] <timotimo> oh

[17:40] <moritz> and True.ACCEPTS(anything) is always True

[17:40] <timotimo> that makes total sense

[17:40] <moritz> but S/// just returns the modified string

[17:40] <moritz> which is then passed to $lhs.ACCEPTS(...), where it's lost

[17:42] <Altreus> total sense to you maybe

[17:42] <Altreus> :P

[17:42] <Altreus> This implies that $_ will be modified if I do $a ~~ s///

[17:43] <timotimo> it's true!

[17:43] <Altreus> It seems to me the whole point of doing that is to use $a *instead* of $_

[17:43] <Altreus> on account of how I also write Perl5

[17:43] <Altreus> this seems naughty

[17:43] <timotimo> that's right

[17:43] <timotimo> ~~ binds $_ for you only in the right-hand-side of itself

[17:43] <timotimo> so you don't have to my $_ := $a manually

[17:44] <Altreus> ah!

[17:44] <Altreus> so $a ~~ S/// is actually S'ing $a, but that returns a new $a, which is discarded

[17:44] <Altreus> Whereas the lowercase s does ... something else, which $a can ACCEPT and thereby modify itself?

[17:44] <timotimo> still not quite

[17:44] <timotimo> let me try to desugar it somewhat

[17:44] *** dakkar left
[17:45] <timotimo> $a ~~ S/// works a lot like this: my $_ := $a; my $result = S///; return $result.ACCEPTS($a)

[17:45] <timotimo> since S/// doesn't touch $_, it has no visible effect to the outside

[17:46] <timotimo> and the result string will be used as the thing to smart match $a against

[17:46] <timotimo> so you want the binding of $_, but not the match behaviour of ~~

[17:46] <timotimo> that's why rakudo (should?) suggests using "given" instead

[17:47] <Altreus> it did do that

[17:47] <Altreus> and we followed suit

[17:47] <Altreus> so the "side-effect" of mutating $_ is actually fine because ~~ gives us a super-local $_ for the purpose

[17:48] <Altreus> Is .subst an acceptable alternative?

[17:48] <Altreus> It seems a bit javascripty but I guess JS can be right sometimes

[17:49] <timotimo> subst is an acceptable alternative

[17:49] <timotimo> another is S[...] = ...

[17:49] <timotimo> which is super funky

[17:49] <moritz> wait what?

[17:50] <timotimo> that doesn't exist?

[17:50] <timotimo> m: my $_ = "hello"; my $result = S[ll] = 99; say $result; say $_

[17:51] <timotimo> :D

[17:51] <timotimo> i did say it's super funky

[17:53] <Altreus> I think I understand more things

[17:53] <Altreus> Possibly not S[]

[17:53] <timotimo> :D

[17:53] <Altreus> unless I just pretend it's Perl5's substr all over again

[17:53] <timotimo> how does that work?

[17:53] <timotimo> do you assign into the result of a substr call to modify a string?

[17:53] <moritz> substr($a, $from, $to) = $replacement

[17:53] <Altreus> yes

[17:53] <timotimo> ah

[17:54] <timotimo> yeah, we do have substr-rw

[17:54] <moritz> it's even *more* funky than that

[17:54] <Altreus> but you can also just provide the replacement as the 4th parameter

[17:54] <moritz> S[...], I mean

[17:54] <timotimo> yeah, the thing about S[...] = ... is that it thunks the RHS

[17:54] <moritz> because with s[...] = ... and the upper-case form, the right-hand side is evaluated for each match

[17:54] <Altreus> well the other thing is that you had to set $_

[17:54] <Altreus> I can do that anyway :P

[17:54] <Altreus> I could have done that to solve my original question :D

[17:55] <Altreus> wait hang on, this means that part of what I had was my $_ := $a.lc.trim;

[17:56] <Altreus> I feel like there's a better way hiding in here

[17:56] <timotimo> i'm not sure what code you're currently at, and what's bothering you about it

[17:56] <Altreus> sorry, I was just thinking that when I did $a.lc.trim ~~ S///, the smartmatch put the trimmed string in $_

[21:00] <jdv79> the .perl version is much more clear

[21:00] <jdv79> whatever

[21:00] <masak> Python kinda has a point there, defaulting to some variant of .perl

[21:01] <masak> or rather, the REPL always prints the repr() of things, but print an array and all its contents is repr()'d

[21:01] <jdv79> i get it.  such is the gist tradeoff.

[21:02] <masak> Perl 6 has way to many was to stringify things

[21:02] <timotimo> since you tend to be quite good at explaining stuff, and know a whole bunch

[21:02] <jdv79> maybe it should switch the stringification method contextually? :)

[21:03] <timotimo> what are the DWIMs and WATs of Any's "i'll behave as a list of a single item" behaviour?
