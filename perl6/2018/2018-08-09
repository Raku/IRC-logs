[05:16] <benjikun> You could use `$dbi.do(qq:to/END/); ... stuff { perl code } stuff ... END`

[05:18] <benjikun> Is that okay xinming?

[05:19] <benjikun> If it is user inputed, make sure you sanitize it btw

[05:21] <benjikun> You should really be using `$dbi.prepare( ... );` and putting `?` for the string values you want passed in

[06:37] <dev> Okay

[06:37] <AlexDaniel> riot (if installed through google play) shouldn't drain battery

[06:37] <AlexDaniel> but I suppose it's different when installed from f-droid

[06:38] <benjikun> F-Droid just has FOSS apps

[06:39] <AlexDaniel> eh, not exactly

[08:13] <masak> moritz: there was a term "fakecutable" that was used during the Parrot years. I forget the details -- was it just something that called parrot?

[08:13] <jmerelo> Cujincode: I think what it mentioned was compilation to bytecode, _not_ to native 

[08:13] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaiepi

[08:14] <Cujincode> That's correct, so may still have needed Parrot library to work

[08:14] <jmerelo> Cujincode: although the FAQ mentions "Rakudo, a Perl 6 compiler based on Parrot, allows compilation to bytecode, and a small wrapper exists that can pack up a bytecode file and parrot into a single executable."

[08:14] <jmerelo> Cujincode: Parrot is not really a library, but an obsolete version of the virtual machine that interpreted Perl 6. It's no longer developed. 

[08:14] <masak> oh, so Parrot got bundled into the executable.

[08:15] <jmerelo> Cujincode: As a matter of fact, I don't know why that's still in the FAQ, although it's clearly an archive.

[08:15] <masak> jmerelo: Parrot is not "an obsolete version of *the* virtual machine". :)

[08:15] <jmerelo> masak: OK. "The former Perl 6 virtual machine"?

[08:15] <masak> or *a* former one. Niecza is another.

[08:16] <moritz> masak: fakecutables existed in parrot, and it bundled parrot, and worked for NQP, but never for rakudo, iirc

[08:16] <masak> moritz: :(

[08:16] <jmerelo> masak: Right. I meant "A deprecated virtual machine". Words failed me. Too little coffee.

[08:16] <masak> jmerelo: "deprecated" is also the wrong term ;)

[08:16] <jmerelo> masak: Oh? 

[08:16] <masak> "deprecated" means "we're going to remove this API feature, but we haven't yet, so try not to depend on it"

[08:17] <masak> Parrot is no API feature, and no-one has deprecated it.

[08:17] <masak> it just doesn't get used anymore.

[08:17] <jmerelo> masak: and it's already removed... So "former" will do. Thanks!

[08:18] <moritz> parrot is just dead. Abandoned.

[08:18] <masak> Parrot went through phases of targeting Perl 6 and targeting "everything" at the cost of targeting Perl 6. in the end it ended up serving no-one well.

[08:18] <masak> like lizmat has phrased it, an Edsel.

[08:18] <jmerelo> lizmat++

[08:19] <Cujincode> And so seems my hope of doing Perl6 executables, for now

[08:19] <masak> Parrot also had interesting technological challenges, stemming from some unusual design choices.

[08:19] <masak> for example, it was CPS-based, so in effect everything was on the heap.

[08:19] <jmerelo> Cujincode: I mean, we have today Docker containers. You can use them wherever Docker is available. Which is all over the place. Docker containers are the new executables.

[08:20] <benjikun> I've heard a lot of people wanting building to executables supported constantly, including myself

[08:20] <Cujincode> Ok, thank you. I'll look into Docker

[08:21] <benjikun> It seems like a big leap, but it sure would be nice

[08:22] <masak> it feels doable (but probably not a priority) to bundle together moarvm and some bytecode into a fakecutable

[08:22] <benjikun> When will that become a priority?

[08:22] <moritz> when somebody makes it their priority

[08:23] <benjikun> Yeah, surely :P

[08:23] <masak> yeah, go for it!

[08:23] <masak> I love it when people don't just demand features, but actually sit down and help implement them

[08:24] <Cujincode> Having brought this up I'll see if I can get some wheels in motion

[08:24] *** Kaypie joined

[08:25] <benjikun> I'm not demanding them or anything, if that's what it seemed like masak. Sorry if that's the case

[08:25] <benjikun> didn't mean to seem pushy

[08:25] <masak> benjikun: "demanding" might have been overstating it -- sorry :)

[08:26] <masak> benjikun: but yeah, "When will that become a priority?" is a curious stance to take with an open-source project

[08:26] <lookatme_q> If nqp and moarvm can running not depend the path, it would be nice

[08:26] <benjikun> masak: Yeah, I don't really know why I said that

[08:27] <masak> :)

[08:28] <Cujincode> It is a reasonable question about a desired feature

[08:29] <benjikun> aren't modules installed in a way to make outputting executables possible

[08:30] <benjikun> I seem to have remember hearing that the last time this discussion popped up

[08:30] <benjikun> maybe how ~/.perl6/precomp/ lays the stuff out, idk

[08:30] <benjikun> I'm certainly not an expert in the overall scheme of internals

[08:31] <lookatme_q> Can the Perl 6 using the precomp code without the source file ? 

[08:31] <lookatme_q> the byte code

[08:32] <lizmat> lookatme_q: yes, technically there is no reason why it shouldn't be able to do that (afaik)

[08:32] <benjikun> hmm

[08:33] <lizmat> in fact, the design of the CompUnit::Repository interface is such that it should be possible for someone to create a CU:R module

[08:33] <lizmat> that could be used in an all pre-compiled only environment, such as maybe a Raspberry Pi or other such small computers

[09:45] <benjikun> sena_kun: You can use smart matching ~~

[09:46] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[09:46] <sena_kun> benjikun, what do you mean?

[09:46] <benjikun> m: my $s = 'hello'; say so $s ~~ Str;

[09:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar fa73bb48d: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[09:46] <benjikun> another way is to use .WHAT, but it's slower

[09:46] <benjikun> and yet another way is to use .isa, but it's even slower

[09:47] <sena_kun> no, I know how to check type, I want coercion from type X to a small number of other types.

[09:47] <sena_kun> I don't know which type will be used at runtime from my set, so I need to decide dynamically.

[09:47] <benjikun> ohh

[09:48] <sena_kun> the one way is to manually "If $type eq 'Array' $value .= Array else if $type eq 'Foo'` and so on, but I'd like to do it in one call. :)

[09:48] <Kaiepi> hm

[09:48] <sena_kun> m: my $value = <1 2 3>.Seq;  say $value.&{'sum'};

[09:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar fa73bb48d: OUTPUT: «sum␤»

[09:49] <sena_kun> so it is some issue with my way of calling here.

[09:49] <Kaiepi> i disabled the kernel's default way of handling ip headers so i could deal with it manually, but i guess that doesn't work

[12:27] <Altreus> hmm I asked a while ago about circular dependencies when it came to type constraints and the consensus was not to bother with type constraints, or to refactor to use roles all the time

[12:27] <Altreus> but now I discover, I have two classes that are related, and each one will at some point need to call new on the other

[12:27] *** curan left
[12:27] <Altreus> One could fetch a Message object and from it construct its related Channel; or one could have a Channel object and from it construct its related Messages

[12:27] <jnthn> It's only a problem if they are spread over different files

[12:28] <jmerelo> Altreus: you can also use add_trustee https://docs.perl6.org/routine/add_trustee

[12:28] <jnthn> And Perl 6 ain't Java. You aren't limited to one class per file.

[12:28] <Altreus> they are, just because it would be a big file

[12:29] <Altreus> welp

[12:30] <Altreus> a C++/Java trick is to have a file that uses all the other modules, and get that included at the start of the process, so everything is always visible

[13:55] <Xliff> I have this: 

[13:55] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/lib/GTK/Compat/Types.pm6#L28

[13:56] <Xliff> But I am beginning to wonder if that is causing the problems I am running into. Namely, that .next works properly, but .prev doesn't work AT ALL.

[13:57] <timotimo> that looks correct, but only if gpointer is typedef'd to "something*"

[13:58] <timotimo> typedef void* gpointer;

[13:58] <timotimo> that's fair

[13:58] <Kaiepi> would Pointer[::?CLASS] work?

[16:12] <jmerelo> Zoffix: Only 5 less... 

[16:12] <Zoffix> OTOH more, the second run got a whole ton of passes, so it's just floppers

[16:12] <jmerelo> Zoffix: I think one of the problem is basically that it's impossible so far to include dependencies... Those are still going to fail, right?

[16:12] <AlexDaniel> also, many pull requests were not merged

[16:20] <sena_kun> um, at least 6 of my PRs were merged and it made broken modules installable.

[16:21] <jmerelo> Zoffix: and, as Yogi Berra said, it's difficult to make predictions, over all if they are about the future merging of pull requests.

[16:24] <jmerelo> timotimo: probably.

[16:24] <sena_kun> timotimo, it may be so. anyway, I'd rather look at the log when toast will be ready instead of guessing.

[16:24] <Zoffix> "<Zoffix> OTOH more, the second run got a whole ton of passes, so it's just floppers"

[16:45] <Zoffix> And there's no easy switch to make it non-preemptible. You have to create a new VM and clone the drive too or something

[18:54] <atweiden-air> i'm running shell("SHELL=/bin/bash unshare --fork --pid chroot /mnt stuff")

[18:54] <atweiden-air> and, not sure if directly related, having issues unmounting /mnt until after the p6 process terminates

[18:54] <atweiden-air> it terminates due to an error unmounting, says /mnt is busy

[18:55] <atweiden-air> is there something i need to do to clean up after the shell(unshare --fork)?

[18:56] <atweiden-air> i've tried mixing in sleep(7) between unmount calls

[20:48] <Xliff> jnthn: If you have a class that's repr('CStruct') with attributes that act like a double-linked list, will == comparisons work?

[20:48] <Xliff> Aparently the attributes are boxed, which means just looking at the class won't work.

[20:51] <timotimo> you can have two different objects with the same next and previous pointer

[20:51] <timotimo> one of those would then not be "in the list"
