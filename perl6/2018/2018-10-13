[00:47] <Xliff> timotimo: MVM_JIT_DISABLE didn't do anything. I am still getting the segfault, and this one I can't trace back to a location.

[00:48] <timotimo> so in "bt" you don't see any frames that have a tc?

[00:48] <timotimo> oh, perhaps you've got a moarvm with --debug=0

[00:49] <timotimo> i'm not sure if it would have enough info left to figure out where tc lives

[00:51] *** cognominal-p6 left
[00:57] <Xliff> timotimo: I rakudobrew my stuff. Is there a way to get one with a greater debug?

[00:57] <timotimo> rakudobrew has a switch that lets you give an option to moar's configure.pl

[00:57] <timotimo> that's where --debug=3 would go

[00:57] <timotimo> if you need to dig around in the local variables and such, you'll get a whole lot of "value optimized out" if your --optimize isn't =0
