[01:18] <Xliff> Is there any way to use the Perl6 grammar to match perl6 code in a string?

[01:18] <Xliff> For example... I want to be able to add to method calls, so I'd like to invoke the parser to catch all methods. Is that possible?

[01:20] <timotimo> you can invoke the parser, but it'll also do stuff like execute begin blocks for you

[01:20] <timotimo> or the values for constants, as well as traits

[01:21] <timotimo> even if you stop it at stage parse, it won't help against arbitrary code being run

[01:33] <Xliff> Ah. I was just hoping it would help make parsing method definitions easier.

[13:28] <bichu> not that*

[13:28] <bichu> perl6-zef is being reviewed still for Debian 9 Stretch

[13:29] <bichu> i just installed it, so thought I should let the communithy know, as the online docs didnt have something relating to that.

[13:29] <bichu> so on Debian 9, we are not forced to build.

[16:26] <uzl> Hello #perl6!

[16:27] <uzl> Yesterday I uploaded a module to/through PAUSE to CPAN but it hasn't showed up to neither metacpan nor P6 module directory.

[16:28] <Skarsnik> Hello, what is the name of the module?

[16:28] <uzl> This is it: https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/U/UZ/UZLUISF/Perl6/

[16:28] <uzl> Skarsnik: ENIGMA::Machine

[16:29] <Skarsnik> hm yes it does not show on modules.perl6.org

[16:29] <Skarsnik> sorry I am not familiar with cpan module sadly

[16:30] <MasterDuke> uzl: are you sure your META6.json is correct? i don't know cpan either, but i believe some error in the META6.json is a common cause of modules not showing up

[16:32] <uzl> MasterDuke: https://gitlab.com/uzluisf/ENIGMA-Machine/raw/master/META6.json <- This is the module's META6.json

[16:33] *** titsuki joined
[16:33] *** dakkar left
[16:33] <Skarsnik> I think it's Test::Meta to test metafile?

[16:34] <MasterDuke> uzl: nothing jumps out at me, but yeah, have you run it through Test::Meta?

[16:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v titsuki

[16:35] *** poohman left
[16:35] <uzl> MasterDuke: so `zef install Test::Meta` and feed the META6.json to it?

[16:38] <MasterDuke> uzl: i'd guess so, but i haven't used it myself

[16:39] *** cjkinni left
[16:40] <uzl> Thanks. I'll see what I can do.

[16:44] <uzl> MasterDuke: Everything seems to be okay with META6.json -> https://i.imgur.com/s1GRiR2.png

[16:48] <Zoffix> uzl: did you get any email from PAUSE? Does it say all was OK? There should be a third .meta file for the dist in https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/U/UZ/UZLUISF/Perl6/ (like in https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/Z/ZO/ZOFFIX/Perl6/ )

[16:49] <uzl> Zoffix: Hold on a sec, let me check my email.

[16:49] <Zoffix> uzl: and how did you make that .tar? By hand or with App::Mi6 or something?

[16:53] <Zoffix> ah, k, those are just invalid META.json files

[16:57] <uzl> Zoffix: just the tar command I posted earlier.

[18:51] <poohman> ?

[18:52] <geekosaur> that's what tobs showed you

[18:59] <geekosaur> tbh if I wanted to use strings there I'd probably use a Set instead

[18:59] <timotimo> it won't give you a symbol for them then, though, no?

[19:00] <geekosaur> the question is whether I'd care in that case. usually, I wouldn't

[19:01] <jmerelo> Hey y'all, there's a Squashathon going on: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/wiki/SQUASHathon May I interest you in solving 1 or 10 documentation issues? https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues

[19:04] <geekosaur> for doc issues tht can be an advantage: you'd be more likely to spot things that make more sense to developers than users, when the users are the ones who most need the docs

[19:33] <yoleaux> 15 Oct 2018 15:14Z <Zoffix> lucasb: R#2131 is blocked by R#1289, so it's deferred until 6.e or later. And R#1842 is a Rakudo issue, not a language issue (neither of the classes involved are part of the spec).

[19:33] <yoleaux> 15 Oct 2018 15:17Z <Zoffix> lucasb: to clarify, R#2131 is blocked by R#1289, because current behaviour is part of 6.c spec ( https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/6.c-errata/S05-modifier/counted.t#L218-L220 ) and any modifications—if agreed on—would have to be behind a language version pragma

[19:35] <lizmat> round of confusion :-(

[19:35] <lucasb> lizmat, agreed

[19:36] <Zoffix> I'll take it.

[19:36] <lucasb> "Is it Rakudo or Raku?"

[19:36] <jmerelo> Plus, what would be do with all the plush Camelias?

[19:36] <lucasb> "Oh, they are not the same thing?"

[19:36] <timotimo> "do" is the new word for "compiler"

[19:36] <Zoffix> Yeah

[19:37] <Zoffix> Makes a lot of sense. What's Rakudo? Well, "-do" suffix is like a "compiler" and it's a compiler for Raku language :)

[19:38] <lizmat> .oO( it's the thing that does Raku )

[19:38] <Zoffix> I think there's an Issue in user exp. repo saying user went to install "Perl 6" but is being told to download "Rakudo".. Raku resolves that :)

[19:38] <lizmat> at the moment it feels to me as the start of my withdrawal

[19:39] <Zoffix> Withdrawal?

[19:39] <timotimo> and when the gnu people build a compiler into the gcc, it'll be gRakuc maybe

[19:39] <Zoffix> Withdrawal from what?

[19:40] <lizmat> from this

[19:40] <Zoffix> Not a bad idea :)

[21:36] <thundergnat> I notice that I am confused...

[21:39] <thundergnat> Is there something special about method style subroutine calling? Seems like it insists that any return value that LOOKS like a negative number, by god, IS, regardless of any Str coercion.

[22:06] <Ulti> is there a nice way to declare operating system dependence in modules?

[22:06] <Ulti> is it part of the META6 spec?

[22:07] *** zakharyas joined
[22:08] <Skarsnik> it's ... weird

[22:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zakharyas

[22:08] <ugexe> is the os an actually dependency? or is something that only runs on that os?

[22:08] <Ulti> both?

[22:08] <ugexe> i.e. what do you *actually* need access to

[22:08] <Ulti> so for example I wanted to try out Red and it depends on DB::Pg that module depends on epoll which is a profoundly Linux specific thing

[22:09] <ugexe> so you would declare a native dependency on epoll

[22:09] <Ulti> and stuff like libuuid assumed to be on the system is a very Linux thing too

[22:09] <ugexe> again, a dependency on libuuid

[22:09] <Ulti> ugexe: sure but its also the operating system not everyone down the chain will know epoll implies Linux only

[22:10] <Ulti> so if you have a choice of two DB modules like say DB::Pg and DBIish which one are you going to use if you want to have maximum user share?

[22:11] <ugexe> so add os dependency management to allow finding maximum use share asier?

[22:11] <ugexe> s/use/user/

[22:11] <Ulti> no so that when I try and install it just says its never going to happen

[22:11] <Ulti> not just deps need to be found

[22:11] <Skarsnik> damn. I had the syntax somwewhere to do that

[22:11] <ugexe> it will do that if epoll cannot be found

[22:12] <Ulti> libuuid I installed then I just got to ohhhh its never going to work so it was 30 minutes of my life wasted

[22:12] <geekosaur> it's nto going to know the difference between nto installed and not installable

[22:12] <ugexe> why wont it work?

[22:12] <ugexe> because the tests assume case sensitivity?

[22:12] <Ulti> ugexe: yes but as a user I want to know it doesnt matter that it cant be found, I want to know it will *never* be found on your system

[22:13] <Ulti> ugexe: epoll is a Linux system for doing polling BSD/macOS have their own so does Windows

[22:13] <Ulti> libuv abstracts them

[22:13] <ugexe> you said libuuid doesn't work

[22:13] <geekosaur> libuuid /per se/ is part of linux ext2 utils

[22:13] <Ulti> no I said epoll and I said I got more disgruntled when I got past one dependency I need to find, to discover I was never going to install anyway because a later dep was platform level incompatible

[22:14] <Ulti> libuuid its more its always hanging around Linux

[22:14] <ugexe> "libuuid I installed then I just got to ohhhh its never going to work"

[22:14] <Ulti> macOS you just have to go fish which is a little annoying but totally fine

[22:14] <ugexe> so you didnt meant libuuid, just transitive dependency somewhere before?

[22:14] <Ulti> ugexe: oh its never going to work the next dep is epoll failing

[22:15] <geekosaur> they said first they fought with libuuid neding to eb installed, then they fought with epoll

[22:15] <Ulti> if you could check the chain of deps to see one of them isnt for my operating system I wouldnt have even had to go looking at libuuid

[22:15] <Ulti> straight away you'd see epoll further back

[22:15] <ugexe> fwiw if you are installing DB::Pg you don't need epoll if you don't use the reactive stuff

[22:15] <Ulti> and just tell me this module is uninstallable

[22:15] <ugexe> i commented that stuff out

[22:16] <Ulti> yeah its not any slight on DB::Pg thats just where I hit this

[22:16] <Ulti> but there have been a couple others

[22:16] <Ulti> at the moment the Perl 6 ecosystem is actually quite hostile if you're on Mac

[22:16] <Ulti> and given its a unix thats kind of super bad news for Windows users

[22:17] <Skarsnik> only if your module use libraries

[22:17] <ugexe> so you can declare stuff like https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/32a8cbe889739ce667dfc2d7d44e312567318af1/META6.json#L13-L20

[22:17] <Ulti> Skarsnik: yeah sure

[22:17] <ugexe> so atm you could declare a win32 depenency on say Windows::Does::Not::Work or some such 

[22:18] <Ulti> yeah like some Win32 native GUI module is another good example

[22:19] <Skarsnik> Ui is perl6 is dead anyways, not until we have Qt/Gtk3 binding

[22:20] *** khisanth_ left
[22:20] <Ulti> https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Libui:cpan:GARLANDG  there's this

[22:20] <Ulti> which is kind of neat

[22:21] <ugexe> "name" : { "by-distro.name" : { "debian" : "epoll", "macosx" : "Doesnt::Work::On::OSX", "win32"  : "Doesnt::Work::On::Windows" "" : "Only::Works::On::Linux" } }

[22:21] <Ulti> that has some binaries it pulls down iirc so even more in need of being able to give that level of info

[22:21] <ugexe> which at least kinda does that, until some jerk uploads modules matching those names

[22:22] <Ulti> :D

[22:22] <Ulti> yeah and I guess the modules just explode with an exception on use

[22:23] <Ulti> I guess the issue is people might go hog wild and start specifying OS when its not really necessary

[22:23] <Ulti> then you'll have the opposite problem to now

[22:23] <Ulti> every module is some tiny island

[22:23] <ugexe> not just OS, but like above with distro, or however specific 

[22:23] <Ulti> yeah :(

[22:24] <Ulti> might be more you want hinting rather than control over deps

[22:24] <Ulti> like tested on X

[22:24] <Skarsnik> Os X is annoying for deps anyways

[22:24] <Ulti> true enough

[22:24] <Skarsnik> depends too much how a lib get installed

[22:24] <Ulti> at least for GNU deps

[22:27] <Ulti> a big chunk is probably tests specifically need this maybe

[22:28] <Ulti> if you made something cross platform with tests for the native stuff for each is there a nice way to avoid that in tests? I've never actually looked into it

[22:29] <Ulti> I guess you can just do an if on it and just choose tests

[22:29] <Skarsnik> you can eval a test file according to the Os value

[22:29] <Skarsnik> DBIish do stuff like this

[22:30] <Ulti> also I kind of want all the event loop DB::Pg niceness :P

[22:31] <Ulti> I guess I can just Docker myself to victory

[22:36] <Xliff> I am using Method::Also, now. Thanks so much. Makes aliasing easier.

[22:37] <Xliff> I've noticed that it doesn't work for multi methods. Is this because the strategy you are using for aliasing doesn't support such?

[22:38] <Xliff> Er... sure.

[22:38] <Xliff> Take me a minute.

[22:44] <Ulti> so you declare you want libuuid or something and then it just translates that to: port install libuuid or brew install ossp-uuid depending on which packagemanger you use on MacOS or yum/apt-get install libuuid etc.

[22:44] <geekosaur> because it's nearly impossible to write and even more impossible to maintain?

[22:44] <Ulti> windows there is choco too

[22:44] <Skarsnik> zef could do it

[22:45] <Skarsnik> the best thing is to suggest

[22:45] <Skarsnik> not do it

[22:45] <Ulti> geekosaur: sure but probably not a great deal more impossible than the volunteer contribution of something like homebrew macports

[22:45] <Ulti> like most of the time it could just try the plain name and see if it installs

[22:45] <Xliff> lizmat: https://gist.github.com/Xliff/34b9d2e3e27c76696ec60e6791075634

[22:45] <Skarsnik> like "type apt-get install libpiko before installing this module'

[22:46] <Ulti> Skarsnik: you'd still want the db of mappings of package names

[22:46] <Ulti> for that to be a nice experience

[22:46] <lizmat> Xliff: so you want *all* candidates of .m to be also handled by .M ?

[22:46] <Xliff> lizmat: Yeah

[22:46] <Xliff> If declared.

[22:46] <lizmat> add a proto:

[22:47] <lizmat> proto method m(|) is also<M> {*}
