[00:00] <buggable> üé∫üé∫üé∫ It's time for the monthly Accidental /win Lottery üòçüòçüòç We have 0 ballots submitted by 0 users! DRUM ROLL PLEASE!...

[00:00] <timotimo> can you have a look if it's better now?

[00:00] <buggable> And the winning number is 42! Congratulations to Zoffix! You win a roll of duck tape!

[00:00] <timotimo> buggable: rigged!

[00:00] <tbrowder> fake winner!

[00:01] <timotimo> i should probably do some more work on my advent calendar post, too ... you know, before it's supposed to go up on the blog ...

[00:01] <loops> what topic are you covering timotimo 

[00:02] <mornfall> as a punishment, Zoffix should add POD to WWW :p

[00:02] <timotimo> i'm hoping to do one on cellular automata

[00:03] <loops> ala Wolfram NKS?

[00:03] <tbrowder> timotimo: ref wordpress, i still see 12:01 AM for my blog schedule

[00:05] <timotimo> https://i.imgur.com/uy3Kves.gifv

[00:05] <timotimo> yeah, i read that book when i was already working for someone at uni about that whole topic

[00:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v MasterDuke

[00:10] <timotimo> mornfall: yes, but only by turning it into a module and invoking an empty script and -M-ing the module, or by having a script that just "use TheModuleThatIsActuallyAScript"

[00:12] <tbrowder> timotimo: hm, schedule time looks good in the actual time window setting, but the summary time shows in a different format!!  still think wordpress is crappy and we need another solution.

[00:12] <mornfall> okay i'll give it a try some other day :) also, perl6 on an empty script takes anywhere between 200 and 300ms :\

[00:12] <timotimo> perhaps need to flush some caches or something

[00:12] <tbrowder> my church went to wordpress some years ago and our website is crappy, too!

[00:13] <timotimo> mornfall: on my machine it's always "0:00.10 elapsed"

[00:13] *** w_richard_w joined
[00:14] <MasterDuke> mornfall: more of a style than a performance thing, but it looks like $commit is only used for it's boolean value. i might write it as `my $commit = @*ARGS.elems > 0 and @*ARGS[0] eq '--commit';` (and the `> 0` could probably even be removed)

[00:14] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v w_richard_w

[00:14] *** Cabanossi left
[00:14] <mornfall> MasterDuke: that whole thing is getting ditched :p it's just a safety measure since i was sort-of debugging the script on live data :p

[00:15] <MasterDuke> heh, the best way to debug

[00:15] <mornfall> i'll do a getopt thing when i need something real

[00:15] *** Cabanossi joined
[00:15] <tbrowder> our docs site looks good. should be "easy" to add an advent display and authors could write in pod6!

[00:15] <timotimo> no need to reach for getopt

[00:15] <timotimo> look up sub MAIN :) :)

[00:15] <mornfall> yeah i mean %*options something something

[00:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Cabanossi

[00:16] <mornfall> timotimo: i'll read it right away if you can come up with a p6doc incantation that shows me the docs ;)

[00:17] <MasterDuke> mornfall: i'm not following the code very well, what are you using Algorithm::Diff for?

[00:18] <mornfall> MasterDuke: well, the thing reads in data from a filesystem, then it reads the live (student-visible) copy of that data, then it shows me what changed and perhaps lets me sync up the live data to my copy of it

[00:20] <loops> Saw there was a bug hunting drive for perl6/doc, tried "make html" in there but it died trying to process a "defn" directive in one of the pods

[00:20] <mornfall> the first part collects and formats various bits of info and sorts it into a per-student text file (which then gets diffed to the text file the student currently sees)

[00:20] <loops> Haven't made much progress :-/

[00:21] <mornfall> where did the moarvm blog go... i remember reading something about startup times

[00:21] <mornfall> it's been a while tho (easily a year or more)

[00:21] <MasterDuke> ah, so are actually diffing a whole file, not just a single text string

[00:22] <mornfall> MasterDuke: the files don't exist on disk, they are just strings

[00:23] *** majensen joined
[00:23] <MasterDuke> ok, but you're not really looking for an edit difference, correct?

[00:23] <loops> mornfall: maybe https://6guts.wordpress.com/

[00:24] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v majensen

[00:24] <mornfall> loops: i'm paging through that right now, yeah

[00:24] <MasterDuke> loops: does it tell you which file/directive? i don't know pod very well, but it looks like tbrowder is on now and he does

[00:26] <mornfall> MasterDuke: i just want to see what changed in the approximately 1/4 MiB of text :)

[00:26] <loops> MasterDuke: doc/Language/pod.pod6     has a couple  "defn"  lines.   I deleted them and the html build is proceeding at least.

[00:28] <tbrowder> loops: some of the pod renderers are not quite current with the defn block, but so far i don‚Äôt think it is a rakudo pod issue from what i‚Äôve seen.

[00:28] <loops> i'm only building the html to run  checklink  on them,  thought i might be able to nibble away at https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/561

[00:28] <loops> tbrowder: okay, I figured as much, which is why I just deleted those lines.

[01:51] <AlexDaniel> loops: most warnings there are due to incorrect html that is produced, and that can and should be fixed

[01:51] <AlexDaniel> but maybe that's not very easy, I'm not sure

[01:51] <AlexDaniel> loops: however, if you somehow ignore all the warnings from checklink that are related to incorrect html, there are probably still some 404s and other issues

[01:51] <AlexDaniel> that can be resolved with relatively simple PRs :)

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> so judge yourself!

[02:26] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: you're right also, it's a difficult issue

[02:26] <AlexDaniel> but it's docs&tools, and IIRC a lot of checklink errors come from issues with tools :)

[09:30] <mornfall> do i understand correctly that every time i run a perl6 script, the entire compiler starts out as unoptimized (unspecialised) bytecode? i haven't read too much yet, just ran through the 6guts blog very quickly so my understanding is rather incomplete at this point

[09:31] <jmerelo> mornfall: I would say so, yes. .precomp caches do not store runtime information, far as I understand it.

[10:13] <mornfall> hmm... what would be the best way to have a bunch of modules and scripts that are part of a project which i run from its source directory? something like PERL5LIB would probably suffice, i already tweak PATH

[10:14] <lizmat> there's PERL6LIB: https://docs.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell#index-entry-PERL6LIB-PERL6LIB

[10:15] <mornfall> i see thanks (i was looking at 5to6 variables for whatever reason)

[10:15] <lizmat> also, see the caveat: Note that PERL6LIB is more of a developer convenience in Perl 6 (as opposed to the equivalent usage of PERL5LIB in Perl5) and shouldn't be used by module consumers as it could be removed in the future. This is because Perl 6's module loading isn't directly compatible with operating system paths.

[10:19] <mornfall> could i perhaps use lib $*PROGRAM? *tries*

[10:20] <mornfall> almost

[10:21] <mornfall> .parent, \o/

[10:21] <lizmat> yup... also .sibling("name") also be useful

[10:21] <lizmat> if the code happens to be in a subdir

[10:21] <mornfall> it looks a bit like something that'd be discouraged though... is it?

[10:22] <lizmat> you mean, using "use lib" in a module ?

[10:22] <mornfall> in a script

[10:22] <mornfall> especially with the $*PROGRAM.parent magic

[10:23] <lizmat> personally I don't care too much about that: I'm more of the "whatever works, works" side of the fence

[10:23] <mornfall> :-)

[10:23] <lizmat> but please don't take my opinion to carry any value, please

[10:24] *** qiqi left
[10:24] <lizmat> I'm well aware that programming should be fun, but that there is always a reason for doing it that is not "l'art pour l'art"

[10:25] <mornfall> i'm not saying that it would stop me from using it, but i'm still curious, i didn't find that much info in the docs so far

[10:25] <mornfall> the canonical solution seems to be put your modules in cpan and/or at least install them

[10:25] <lizmat> that's because I guess we haven't got "well established" practices in that area yet

[10:25] <lizmat> mornfall: yeah, if you can do that, that's the easiest

[10:25] <lizmat> let zef and rakudo do the work for you

[10:26] <lizmat> and this will also help you run code with different versions of the same module easier

[10:26] <mornfall> but i like the immediacy of edit-run cycle, without installing anything inbetween

[10:26] <lizmat> true, and that's why there is -I and use lib

[10:26] <lizmat> but you should realize that in Perl 6 they're not necessarily production tools

[10:27] <mornfall> yeah, that's fine, this is not production code either (at least for now; it's just personal-use automation)

[10:27] <mornfall> if the time comes, i'll make it a proper package and all

[10:28] <lizmat> if that works for you, go for it  :-)

[10:28] <lizmat> but remember: TIMTOWTSYITF

[10:28] <lizmat> (There Is More Than One Way To Shoot Yourself In The Foot)

[10:28] <mornfall> i parsed the last f as face for whatever reason :p

[10:37] <mornfall> okay i'm a bit stumped... how do i call a sub that 'is export' in a module, but not :DEFAULT? neither MyMod.mysub nor MyMod::mysub DWIM

[10:38] <lizmat> you can not call subs from outside a package unless they're marked "our"

[10:38] <jnthn> You'd have to mark it `our` scoped, and then the latter will work

[10:38] *** qiqi joined
[10:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v qiqi

[10:39] <mornfall> that's odd i was looking at WWW.pm6 for examples but there's no 'our' anywhere in that module (is the :DEFAULT a substitute for that?)

[10:39] *** dct left
[10:40] *** pecastro joined
[10:40] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[10:41] *** ChoHag joined
[10:41] <jnthn> It's quite common to make the subs lexical and only available through export.

[10:41] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ChoHag

[10:42] <lizmat> mornfall: you should also realize that imports of external subs are also lexical

[10:42] <lizmat> so if you only need the subs of a module inside another sub, or only inside another class

[10:43] <mornfall> i'm confused. so i have lexical sub: sub fetch() is export { yada yada }; but I can't use that when i use MyMod?

[10:43] <lizmat> you can put the use inside the sub / class and have the imported subs only be visible there

[10:43] <lizmat> m: { use Test; pass "foo" }; pass "bar"

[10:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 38bc682b0: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Undeclared routine:‚ê§    pass used at line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[10:44] <lizmat> Test::pass is marked as "is export", but "use Test" will only make that visible inside the scope in which the "use" occurs

[10:45] <lizmat> so in Perl 6 we worry a lot less about what is getting exported / imported

[10:46] <mornfall> oh! so 'is export' lets me use the sub unqualified, and 'our' lets me use it qualified... that's the bit of info i was missing

[10:47] <lizmat> also: when you use "our", it is also put on the default export list (so the "is export" is redundant in that case)

[10:47] <mornfall> is there a way to export something for qualified-use-only?

[10:49] <lizmat> hmmm... maybe I was wrong about "our" putting it on the export list

[10:50] <mornfall> yeah, 'our' seems to achieve what i want afterall

[10:51] <lizmat> hmmm... jnthn: "our" is implicit on class / module and that makes them be exported

[10:52] <lizmat> jnthn: but "our" on a sub inside a module / class doesn't export them

[10:52] <lizmat> jnthn: so I guess they need to be at the top level to have "our" export them?  Is that intentional?

[10:53] <mornfall> actually making the module a 'unit class' instead of 'unit module' allows me to use MyMod.fetch which i kinda like better than MyMod::fetch

[10:53] <jnthn> lizmat: How does it "make them be xported"?

[10:53] <mornfall> but i guess :: is more customary

[10:53] *** qiqi left
[10:54] <jnthn> lizmat: They're just visible as globals

[10:54] <mornfall> okay, completely unrelated question

[10:55] <lizmat> if I have a module file that only consists of "our sub foo() { ... }", loading that module will put &foo in the MY:: of the scope where I use it

[10:55] <mornfall> is 'return %_' somehow magic and does something else than i expect? this is what i have: my %rv; given %rv { .<foo> = 'bar'; return %rv; } # this works, but changing it to return %_ gives me an empty hash

[10:56] <lizmat> jnthn: are you saying that all the globals of a module are always exported ?

[10:56] <mornfall> yes because it should be return $_ /o\

[10:56] <mornfall> silly me

[10:57] <jnthn> lizmat: Well, at least the original mechanism was not export, just global merging. 

[10:58] <mornfall> is there a better way to write this? http://sprunge.us/1GCIJi

[10:58] *** qiqi joined
[10:58] *** sena_kun joined

[10:59] <lizmat> ok, I guess I need to look at that in more depth when I get to write that particular article

[11:00] <jnthn> mornfall: The return $_ could be just `.return`, but it's also possible to do `%args<klic fakulta kod operace zkratka> = $key, 1433, $subj, $op, $subj;`

[13:47] <tbrowder> moritz: can we get an advent practice url? or at least enable sharing the theme settings so users can get a true preview on their personal wordpress site?

[13:47] <sena_kun> tbrowder, new one looks a lot better.

[13:47] <tmtvl> 2018-11-01, eh...

[13:48] <tbrowder> yep, there is some problem with Zoffix's module 'cause i used his original script before his module was created to get the results you see

[13:48] <tmtvl> Seems fine, the first line of every code block is misaligned, but aside from that I see no problem.

[13:51] <tbrowder> yes, i saw that too in my scheduled post. i made a lame attempt to manually edit but didn't persevere--i'll see if i can fix the script and redo.

[13:54] <sena_kun> tbrowder, if you are re-doing, please note that you can get syntax highlighting if code blocks will be done not using indent, but inside of "```perl6" and "```" pair(with zero indentation!).

[14:00] <tbrowder> see the example again. i manually added a newline immediately after each <code> entry and that removed the extra leading space.  is that good enough? if so, i think i can fix the md->html script

[14:03] <tbrowder> sena_kun: ?

[14:04] <sena_kun> tbrowder, should I check November's entry? It still has a newline if you ask me. That's odd, I have used your script and it went a bit better. I still think we have to do a repost though.

[14:05] <tbrowder> refresh the 1 nov entry, i missed some places and did several updates--be sure an refresh the page

[14:05] <tbrowder> i am working on the script now and think i see the solution...

[14:06] <sena_kun> still seeing a newline

[14:06] <domm> if anybody is bored: what about coming up with nice, ideomatic Perl6 solutions to https://adventofcode.com/, and collecting/posting them somewhere? (and no (sorry!), I'm not volunteering...)

[14:08] <tbrowder> where do you see the extra newline? at the top of each code block?

[14:08] <sena_kun> yeah

[14:08] <sena_kun> my post doesn't have that

[14:08] <sena_kun> though I have used your script

[14:09] <tbrowder> so what was your solution in your md source?

[14:09] <sena_kun> well, I hadn't this from the start... My code blocks were wrapped in "```perl6" and "```" pairs, no indentation.

[14:11] <tbrowder> i'm not grokking the whole picture. can you show a one-line code example?

[14:11] <sena_kun> one-liner: no. Give me a second...

[14:13] <tbrowder> oh, i see!  all you did was add the "perl6" after the opening "```", correct?

[14:14] <sena_kun> well, I don't know if it is related to a newline, but it 1)adds a syntax highlighting, which makes things 10x better; 2)it works for me without newlines too.

[14:14] <sena_kun> *works for me and newlines are not added

[14:40] <clarkema> using 'last' in the reduce block works, but gives me the previous value

[14:41] <tbrowder> the only downside is that, for now, you have to manually insert your source md file in a github gist. when he gets back and fixes his module, it will be much easier as you can use a local md file as long as you can provide a github access token.

[15:27] <hahainternet> i'll give it a try in a min

[17:34] <sena_kun> yes, I think. You can do routine too with &foo, likely.

[17:35] <sena_kun> it is called "hyper operator".

[17:35] <Xliff> ($a, $b, $c)¬ª."method"() is the equivalent of ($a, $b, $c).map( *."method"() )

[17:37] <moritz> PSA to all advent authors: it's 2018! :-)

[17:37] <yoleaux> 14:47Z <tbrowder> moritz: can we get a wordpress sandbox site (duplicating the "real" site) for the current advent process?

[17:37] <Xliff> sena_kun: Why surprised?

[17:37] <moritz> (lots of new posts / drafts tagged with 2017 and one even tagged with 2019)

[17:37] <sena_kun> "take a look" as in "try to play with it locally and maybe suggest something"?

[17:38] <sena_kun> as in, I am not a NativeCall wizard(...or it will be sorcerer).

[17:38] <Xliff> 8-) .oO( He catches on quickly! )

[17:38] <Xliff> Oh, no! I don't expect you to go any farther than running ./build.sh and looking at things in the t/ directory.

[17:39] <Xliff> I would like to know how to improve that process though. Standard ./build.sh times on my 10-core VM is about 20 minutes.

[17:39] <sena_kun> A-a-a-ah. That makes things easier, I think.

[17:39] <sena_kun> yikes

[17:39] <Xliff> :)

[17:39] <Xliff> Yes. That's offputting.

[17:40] <sena_kun> there is no way to ship pre-built ones? maybe with some choosing code added.

[17:40] <Xliff> I know I can cut that down by just running Perl6, but during precompile there is no output emitted. I'd like to introduce a switch in rakudo that will tell you what modules are being precompiled.

[17:40] <Xliff> There is also that.

[17:41] <Xliff> I think I can use CURI and staging, but I am not to that point, yet.

[17:41] *** pmurias left

[17:42] <Xliff> Yeah. It's in META6:depends

[17:43] <sena_kun> well, I run `./build.sh` first thing, so haven't installed any deps yet. :)

[17:43] <Xliff> Oh, LOL!

[18:37] <Xliff> Yes, please!

[18:37] <Xliff> I just checked that one and it worked fine on my end. Can you try running it again? I've noticed that there can be bouncing crashes when using GTK

[18:39] <sena_kun> https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/b01ea0647922910b7791519e7aaa0eb6

[18:39] <Xliff> Yeah. That one definitely bounces. I've noted it. Can you create an issue for that?

[18:40] <sena_kun> I guess.

[18:40] <sena_kun> It also segfaults sometimes.

[18:40] <Xliff> LOL! Don't worry about it. I can do it. ;)

[18:40] <sena_kun> :)

[18:40] <Xliff> Yes. The segfaults are what bounce. 

[18:41] <Xliff> They occur probably 40-50% of the time, which makes no sense. If there is a segfault, then it should be consistent.

[18:41] <sena_kun> You are a real hero for working on this, by the way.

[18:41] <Xliff> I'm pretty sure it's something silly I'm doing, but I haven't had much luck tracing it.

[18:41] <Xliff> sena_kun: Seriously?

[18:41] <Xliff> jnthn started me on this. 

[18:42] <Xliff> Well.... his talk slides did.

[18:42] *** MasterDuke left
[18:42] <sena_kun> Why not? I am too bad with low-level code.

[18:42] <Xliff> .oO( If I knew what I was getting into... )

[18:42] <Xliff> :)

[18:43] <Xliff> I like NativeCall. That and grammars were the two reasons that got me started. Then I found more (a lot more) to keep me here

[18:43] <Xliff> So.... I plug along, doing what I can. :)

[18:43] <Xliff> Also, it might be better if you ran the code from the root directory, directly.

[18:43] <Xliff> perl6 -Ilib t/<name>

[18:44] <sena_kun> is there anything I can post besides plain log?

[18:44] <Xliff> Using prove will work, but this suite will move to examples/ when I'm ready to distribute. I will have 

[18:44] <sena_kun> a kernel, gtk version, what can help in debug?

[18:44] <Xliff> CLI-based tests and whatever tests I can automate from the GUI end. Tests should NOT require user intereraction.

[18:45] <sena_kun> Yes, agreed.

[18:45] <Xliff> Nope.¬†Just having someone go through the examples and letting me know what they think is good enough, right now.

[18:45] <Xliff> Also, anything that's clearly broken deserves an issue on github.

[18:46] <Xliff> So just having you run the tests is a BIG help.

[18:50] <sena_kun> I am not sure I have gtk3 installed in system. :)

[18:50] <mornfall> Xliff: on some (many?) systems the .so comes in the -dev package and the normal package only has so.<version>

[18:51] <sena_kun> no, I have, actually. but yes, it was in `-devel` package. It is quite common, by the way.

[18:52] <Xliff> mornfall: Ah! Thanks for the info, but I do have version objects to pass to 'is native'. Can't track that by distro, but shouldn't 'gdk',v0 be right?

[18:52] <Xliff> OOPS! No, I did not. I had "constant gdk      is export = 'gdk-3', v0"; LOL!

[18:53] <Xliff> The space after the comma is NOT supposed to be there.

[18:53] *** AlexDaniel left
[18:53] <mornfall> Xliff: don't know, *but* DBDish::SQlite uses something something ,v0 and it then goes looking for libsqlite3.so.0 which certainly does not exist on my system

[18:54] <mornfall> *but* it might be something platform-specific in rakudo is borked (i'm on openbsd)

[18:56] <sena_kun> Xliff, I am creating an issue for every new warning I see.

[18:57] <mornfall> is the build.sh essential in some sense? (I'm trying zef install . for now)

[19:00] <mornfall> it's not an issue with p6-GtkPlus

[19:00] <mornfall> everything that wants to load shared libraries is borky

[19:00] <Xliff> mornfall: The situations with the .so files are distribution specific. Those are issues a competent distro should handle.

[19:16] *** pmurias left
[19:18] <mornfall> Xliff: i disagree... this should be automated

[19:18] <mornfall> it is automated for C programs, anyway

[19:19] <sena_kun> Xliff, I think I have checked all examples and created issues for those where I saw warnings or too much of debug output or some Perl 6 errors.

[19:20] <Xliff> mornfall: Usually that was done by lb_config

[19:20] <Xliff> Er... ld_config

[19:20] <Xliff> Don't know why, but they've moved that to -dev packages.

[19:22] <Xliff> This could be because that all programs need to be linked specifically to the lib they compile with. That makes lib changes decoupled from app functionality.

[19:23] <Xliff> Think about myapp that depends on libsomething.so.1.47. Why link to libsomething.so when you don't know what the libsomething developers are going to do?

[19:23] <Xliff> So libsomething.so.48 might introduce a bug that crashes myapp.

[19:23] <Xliff> If libsomething.so.48 was symlinked to libsomething.so it would break myapp.

[19:23] *** pmurias joined
[19:23] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[19:24] <Xliff> With modern package managers, all of those versions of libsomething can be tracked. Once a package updates, the unused versions can be "GC"'d by the package manager.

[19:25] <Xliff> sena_kun: Thank you VERY much! 

[19:25] <Xliff> I appreciate it! 

[19:26] <Xliff> Now if you find some uses for it, please let me know! :)

[19:26] <sena_kun> Xliff, no problem. You can ping me if something is needed. Not really sure if I can help with code though, for this month, likely, not so. :/

[19:26] <Xliff> No worries! This was a big help!

[19:28] <mornfall> Xliff: I don't have any .so symlinks -- the system linker takes care of selecting (presumably the latest) version at build time, and the program will stick to that version at runtime

[19:29] <mornfall> Xliff: also, this is not a linux distro, it's a different operating system

[19:29] <mornfall> (still unix though)

[19:29] <Xliff> :)

[19:29] <Xliff> Still wanna have it supported. :)

[19:30] <Xliff> It wants to run on all the *nixes

[19:31] <mornfall> well, if you want to go the 'manual' route, you will have to add a line to all the packages that use NativeCall every six months just for OpenBSD :P presumably similar things happen in other operating systems

[19:31] <mornfall> i'd much rather patch NativeCall to deal with this in an appropriate platform-specific way

[19:32] <Xliff> mornfall: Actually, "is native" can take a function. That's probably the best way to handle it, although that means a run-time penalty for every call.

[19:32] <mornfall> there are already functions named 'guess_library_name' in NativeCall

[19:33] <mornfall> let me see what can be done

[19:34] <Xliff> Thanks!

[19:35] <Xliff> mornfall: Um. If "is native" only specifies a str, search for latest file matching lib<libname>.so.\d+ ??

[19:36] <Xliff> I've always been told to put the ,v<num> specifier into nativecall code. I'm assuming this is for the reason I noted, above.

[19:39] <mornfall> Xliff: it's not because of bugs, it's because the SONAME specifies the ABI revision (and that way, also an API revision)

[19:39] <mornfall> Xliff: if you remove functions from a library, or change their meaning, you are expected to bump the SONAME

[19:41] <Xliff> Ah. Technically, that's kinda the same thing I said (that's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!) =-)

[19:41] <mornfall> no, it's really quite different

[19:41] <mornfall> bugs happen all the time, and SONAME changes don't prevent that

[19:41] *** clarkema joined
[19:42] <Xliff> I'm kinda kidding. But if a program expects a specific ABI, then if that changes you do NOT want to lose the old one, yes?

[19:42] <mornfall> specifying you want v2 of cairo can give you any number of versions of the code -- you only specify the ABI

[19:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v clarkema

[19:42] <mornfall> cairo has been v2 for many years now :)

[19:42] <Xliff> :)

[19:42] <mornfall> on Linux, anyway

[19:43] <mornfall> i'm pretty sure bugs have come and gone

[19:43] <Xliff> Yes. You are correct in that reason. However I still stand by my statement that if an app expects a certain A[PB]I, then it wants to stick with that one because that's what it expects.

[19:43] <mornfall> the point is, the absolute SONAME is not a significant piece of information and I think rakudo is in the wrong here to recommend using it

[19:44] <Xliff> A change in A[PB]I almost certainly means a change in the app.

[19:44] <Xliff> mornfall: On that topic.... we can agree,

[19:44] <mornfall> A change in ABI can mean a recompile, a change in API might need some other changes.

[19:45] <mornfall> also there's absolutely no way to ask for API versions with shared objects

[19:45] <mornfall> if you build a C program, you only get to specify -lcairo

[19:45] <mornfall> that's where your choices end

[19:46] <mornfall> everything else is the responsibility of the platform (linker, runtime linker, platform conventions) to ensure that your program, after it was linked with -lcairo, will continue to get the same ABI it was built against

[19:46] <Xliff> Some distros are going far enough as to specify the version in the lib name.

[19:46] <Xliff> So '-l cairo' becomes '-l cairo_3.14'

[19:46] <Xliff> But that might touch on what you just said.

[19:47] <tmtvl> Perl 6 GTK, huh. Neat. I've been thinking about binding Qt, but it seems like a giant job.

[19:47] <mornfall> i have never seen that (other than upstreams going for things like libgtk3.so vs libgtk2.so, which leads to -lgtk2 and -lgtk3)

[19:47] <Xliff> tmtvl: Ooh! Want some help? I'm yo huckleberreh!

[19:48] <mornfall> anyway, these calls drill all the way down to $*VM.something... so the relevant bit of code is probably in MoarVM

[19:48] <Xliff> Although my dance card is currently taken up with GTK, it was an idea that I would move on to Qt after that. Depends on the nature of rakudo's C++ support in NativeCall.

[19:49] <tmtvl> Xliff, so far I've only just started wrapping my head around yowcow's slides/modules.

[19:51] <mornfall> okay maybe not moar, $*VM is still set up by rakudo

[19:52] <tmtvl> But I'll make sure to put my stuff on gh when I get things off the ground.

[19:53] <Xliff> tmtvl: Link, please?

[19:53] <mornfall> are you kidding me CORE.setting is 2.2MiB (yeah, it has the function I was looking for)

[19:53] <mornfall> surely that's generated

[19:53] <tmtvl> Xliff, Link to?

[19:53] <Xliff> yowcow's slides?

[19:54] <mornfall> yeah found it, don't mind me

[19:54] <tmtvl> https://speakerdeck.com/yowcow/introduction-to-perl-6-native-call

[19:56] <tmtvl> There's also https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/day-21-nativecall-backs-and-beyond-c/ although some of that may be outdated.

[20:03] <mornfall> I'm pretty sure you want to use smokeqt or somesuch to bind qt, not C++ NativeCall

[20:07] <clarkema> Anyone else playing with interesting AoC solutions?

[20:07] <Xliff> tmtvl: Thanks!

[20:08] *** silug joined
[20:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v silug

[20:11] <tmtvl> mornfall: smoke doesn't work with Qt 5, and Qt 4 has been EOL-ed.

[20:12] <mornfall> tmtvl: well, chrisburel has done some work in that regard (see their github)

[20:14] *** sjoshi left
[20:14] *** tobs` left
[20:15] <mornfall> i'm reasonably sure it's the right way to go about it (yes, it might need to be finished up and it needs a lot of C++ knowledge)

[20:16] <mornfall> but Qt is *huge* and the introspection provided by smoke is a substantial headstart

[20:16] *** sushi-roll joined
[20:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sushi-roll

[20:16] <mornfall> i would also consider doing it the other way around... qt has a javascript interpreter in it, and you can kinda compile raku into js?

[20:17] *** sushi-roll left
[20:17] <pmurias> mornfall: what sort of js does qt have?

[20:17] <yoleaux> 16:10Z <SmokeMachine> pmurias: sorry, I just reloaded and that haven‚Äôt warn again...

[20:17] <mornfall> modern qt apps tend to be written in javascript anyway, on top of QML

[20:17] <Xliff> Ew.

[20:18] <Xliff> Does smokeqt generate it's own CPP files? I can't find much on its proper installation or usage.

[20:19] <mornfall> Xliff: as for p6-GtkPlus -- it might be a *really* good idea to use something like NETWORK_TESTING for the interactive tests :p

[20:19] <Xliff> Why NETWORK_TESTING?

[20:19] <mornfall> (I patched rakudo to ignore the version on openbsd locally, so the thing runs now)

[20:19] <mornfall> Xliff: 'something like'

[20:19] <SmokeMachine> I'm moving my post's draft to wordpress... its not complete, but could someone take a look at it?

[20:19] <mornfall> i really don't expect 'zef install' to start popping up weird windows :p

[20:20] <mornfall> unless i perhaps ask for that?

[20:20] <mornfall> ===> Testing: HTTP::UserAgent:ver<1.1.46>:auth<github:sergot>

[20:20] <mornfall> # NETWORK_TESTING was not set

[20:20] <Xliff> mornfall: OK, the thing is that all of the 't/' files are interactive. They cannot be for use in Perl6 tests. The serious current non-interractive tests have not been developed, yet.

[20:20] <mornfall> ^^ this is a good way to do it (with a different var, presumably)

[20:21] <Xliff> For non-interractive, I mean things like... checking that CStruct classes and GTK/GDK classes match sizes, that you can use all modules OK, and other such things.

[20:22] <Xliff> This includeds non-interactive tests that may pop up windows, but will not require a user to sit in front of them and click something to make the test pass (GTK does have some automation functions that can be used for this)'

[20:22] <mornfall> i guess i can't create pull requests from the git cli, huh? :p

[20:22] <Xliff> Those are a LONG way from being developed. I'm only 5.5 months in.

[20:22] *** pecastro left
[20:22] <mornfall> Xliff: you have 5.4 months on me :P

[20:23] <Xliff> The files currently in t/ will be moved to examples/  or demo/ and run like the gtk-demo folder in the gtk source suite.

[20:23] <Xliff> mornfall: So let's combine forces! :P

[20:23] <mornfall> started looking at perl6 last Thursday

[20:23] <Xliff> (and no.. this does not mean "combine" in the anime sense. Let's leave the gattai out of this. Thanks)

[20:24] *** pecastro joined
[20:24] <mornfall> well, i sorta moved on from GUI stuff, sorry about that

[20:24] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[20:25] <mornfall> turns out I like commandline interfaces a lot more than pointing and clicking

[20:25] <Xliff> :) no worries

[20:25] <Xliff> Actually... I kinda agree with you, but as I age (and my fingers grow fatter), I appreciate the GUI aspectg.

[20:26] <Xliff> s/aspectg/aspect/ # See whut I mean?

[20:26] <pmurias> mornfall: rakudo.js depends on some modern js features so running it on some old crusty js engine might be hard

[20:28] <tmtvl> I'm kind of playing around with Sass, but if I see something useful I can do in the GTK repo I'll give it a try.

[20:28] <mornfall> pmurias: JavaScriptCore, apparently

[21:25] <pmurias> mornfall: I haven't ever used QML so I don't have an informed opinion on it, porting rakudo.js to some old JS VM seems super crazy tho

[21:27] <mornfall> i'm not saying it's a good idea, or even useful... but it may still be less work than trying to bind via C++

[21:29] <pmurias> there is https://www.npmjs.com/package/shimmy-shimmy-yam-qt for using qt from node.js

[21:33] <pmurias> mornfall: maybe I can't tell you how hard the C++ bindings are, I don't plan to do the port as it wouldn't be fun for sure and I'm not particularly interested in learning/using qt/gtk+ (I'm not convinced native desktop guis really have a future)
