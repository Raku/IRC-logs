[00:16] <diegok> Hi!, anyone using any of Redis or Redis::Async modules succesfully?. Firt one connects OK and I can set keys, but hangs forever when trying to call any "read" command on it. The later says it can't find liberedis.so but it's present on my box on /usr/local/lib/... :-/

[00:21] <jnthn> Hm, I'm sure one of my colleagues used the latter of those recently and ran into the same error, then somehow resolved it.

[00:21] <jnthn> I dunno how, but it mighta been that he'd only just installed the lib and needed to run ldconfig or something

[00:25] <jnthn> sleep &

[00:25] *** lookatme joined
[00:26] <geekosaur> possibly also changing /etc/ld.so.conf to include /usr/local/lib

[00:27] <diegok> jnthn: thanks!, ldconfig passing the local/lib did it!

[03:24] <ZzZombo> Isn't Zef supposed to be included in Rakudo Perl by default? First I suddenly found out that "zef is not an internal or external command blah blah", Because apparently 

[03:24] <ZzZombo> it went missing somehow after long time of working fine.

[03:24] <geekosaur> star yes, dev releases no

[03:25] <ZzZombo> I tried to reinstall Rakudo, but it Zef still doesn't work.

[03:25] <ZzZombo> star, that is it.

[03:28] <ZzZombo> So, either I need to somehow "unlock" it from the installer, or find an alternative way to install modules on Windows, Zef or not. Panda is also missing, BTW, that is expected I guess?

[03:51] <timotimo> so they're pulling a visual studio, git clone moar, nqp, rakudo and later probably also zef

[07:15] <lookatme> Sometimes rakudo will report thread panic trouble :(

[07:15] <El_Che> lookatme: good. It's important that people test/use it on all the supported systems

[07:16] <lookatme> Also I have rakudo under bash on windows, but windows not have a good terminal simulator :(

[07:16] <El_Che> lookatme: at's a "the programmer created a deadlock"-panic? I have that all the time on all the programming languages with threads :)

[07:16] <lookatme> no, it's the problem of rakudo

[07:17] <El_Che> some error messages, like go's, are pretty useless when you hit that

[07:17] <El_Che> if not yet reported, raise an issue on gthub

[07:18] <lookatme> I am not have a stable code to reproduce the issue :)

[08:23] <player> Hello, what's the difference between sub func(\a) { a  = 3 } and sub func($a is rw) { $a = 3 }? Both parameter declarations seem to allow modification of underlying argument.

[08:24] <moritz> player: basically the error mode if you call it with a non-variable

[08:24] <moritz> m: sub func(\a) { a  = 3 }; func(5)

[08:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 49dce163e: OUTPUT: «Cannot modify an immutable Int (5)␤  in sub func at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[08:25] <moritz> player: you'd use the (\a) form if you don't know if you're gonna write to it, or if you want to pass it to something else "raw"

[08:25] <moritz> player: and you use "is rw" if you know you want to modify it, and it's an error to pass in anything else

[08:27] <lookatme> \a is `$a is raw`

[08:27] <AlexDaniel> yesterday I was talking about postmodern ways to do shell quoting. Here's an example from Julia: https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/running-external-programs/

[08:30] <jast> hi guys, I was thinking of making a site with a concise and fair comparison of Perl 5 and Perl 6 (focusing more on actually comparing them than on all the fancy new things in Perl 6), what categories do you think should be covered?

[08:30] <player> moritz, Is  \a is `$a is raw` as lookatme mentioned?

[08:31] <lookatme> I think there some comparison about Perl 5 & 6 on the net

[08:32] <jast> most of them focus on *differences*

[08:32] <lookatme> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#index-entry-trait__is_raw

[08:32] <lookatme> player, ^

[08:32] <jast> typically very much focused on concrete syntax and more of a migration guide than anything else

[08:33] <moritz> player: I don't know if the sigil in $a implies anything in some context that would make the two not quite equivalent

[08:33] * masak .oO( the dollar means "it'll cost ya" ) :P

[08:33] <moritz> jast: are you aware of the 5to6 docs at https://docs.perl6.org/language.html ?

[08:33] <moritz> jast: they might be a good inspiration

[08:34] <moritz> jast: though a 5to6 regex document seems to be missing

[08:34] <jast> yeah, 5to6 is exactly what I don't want to write up

[08:35] <jast> it's a porting/migration guide. I want to write something to help people decide which language to use and whether to stick with Perl 5 or check out Perl 6

[08:36] <moritz> jast: sure, but the topics covered there give you an idea what to include

[08:36] <jast> the goal is to have only trace amounts of actual syntax examples in it

[08:36] <jast> and look also at things like stability, pace of development, community etc.

[08:36] <moritz> ah, more of the meta topics

[08:37] <jast> I am already using various sources to pick language features to cover

[08:37] *** Nanjizal joined
[08:37] <moritz> language extensibility and evolvability are interesting then

[08:37] <jast> certainly

[08:37] <jast> but I was thinking of a drill-down kind of thing, starting out with the big picture stuff and adding on details further down the page

[08:49] <piojo1> AlexDaniel: it looks like Julia is using shell quoting without invoking the shell. That's okay, but it's not in the same spirit as shell()

[08:49] <piojo1> I don't see the point, if a language already has a more fully specified way to deal with commands (with an array of arguments). The whole point of our shell() function is to use the shell.

[08:50] <AlexDaniel> piojo1: well, that's a followup on run&«» discussion (we're doing shell-style quoting in «»)

[08:50] <AlexDaniel> see https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1745

[08:51] <AlexDaniel> so basically they have `run` that is not a PITA to use

[08:51] <AlexDaniel> which is awesome. I love it.

[08:51] <AlexDaniel> I didn't look at the details yet but I want to steal it. Maybe in a module first though.

[08:52] *** cerul left
[08:53] <piojo1> AlexDaniel: oh, I thought it was related to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1325

[08:54] <piojo1> anyway, it's good to keep in mind that shell() is broken. So maybe if you fix one thing, it would be easy to fix another in the same neighborhood? :)

[08:56] <AlexDaniel> well, if we had a Julia-like alternative then people would have less reasons to use shell :)

[08:56] <AlexDaniel> which in my view is a fix to the problem

[08:58] <jast> this is the kind of thing I had in mind (this is a work in progress, of course): https://imgur.com/JXerkc1

[09:02] <stmuk> my personal view is that comparision table of perl 5 and 6 are likely to spark complaints

[09:02] <stmuk> we would be better reaching out to the wider programming community than the perl 5 one (which isn't very large anymore anyway)

[09:05] *** cdg_ joined
[09:05] <jast> well, as people have pointed out, there's a lot of confusion about the differences. the way to fix that is to give people an easy way to see what's different

[09:06] *** klapperl joined
[09:06] <stmuk> there is no perl 6 standard library anyway

[09:07] *** cxreg joined
[09:07] <jast> if I had no idea about either of the two languages and one person tells me, "Perl 5 is stable and Perl 6 is just this tiny hobby project thingy" and another person tells me, "Perl 6 is awesome and Perl 5 is as good as dead anyway", the only logical conclusion is that I need to take anything I read with a grain of salt or ten

[09:07] <stmuk> your target audience will just argue about the comparisions. you won't change any minds 

[09:07] <jast> so anything that is too salesy won't convince me

[09:08] *** Cabanossi joined
[09:08] *** astj left
[09:08] <jast> well, maybe it's not *called* a standard library, but there are various container types and I/O classes and such

[09:08] <stmuk> if I was evaluting two languages I'd spend a couple of evenings coding in each and make a decision based on that

[11:51] <Zoffix> scimon: .uniparse was just added a few weeks ago during 6.d spec review, to replace the working-name of .parse-names that existed since around April 2017. .parse-names will continue to work until 6.e tho

[11:52] <scimon> Yeah. I got this it's just the docs for uniparse don't mention this. It'll be fine one 6.d is released though ;)

[11:57] <melezhik> Hi! probably have already asked this. How can I know time elapsed from the beginning of my program?

[11:58] <Zoffix> jast: I rather not see any "Perl 5 vs Perl 6" charts or anything else. Especially right now, with tensions being so high. The chart in the image could be argued quite a lot: that our spec isn't "complete" or that IO/IPC is supposedly better in Perl 6 (there's at least one Perl 5 module that offers more features than ours + Perl 5 probably has unix sockets)

[11:58] <Zoffix> melezhik: $*INIT-INSTANT

[11:58] <Zoffix> m: sleep 2; say $*INIT-INSTANT

[11:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 49dce163e: OUTPUT: «Instant:1516795150.475504␤»

[11:58] <melezhik> Thanks Zoffix

[11:59] <Zoffix> melezhik: it used to be known as $*INITTIME on older rakudos (still seems to exists as backcompat fudge)

[11:59] <melezhik> ok, I will rely on the new one

[11:59] <Zoffix> c: 2015.12,HEAD say $*INITTIME // $*INIT-INSTANT

[11:59] <committable6> Zoffix, https://gist.github.com/4dbf0df95b31957b9412b5ecef3fb692

[12:00] <Zoffix> "Deprecated since v2017.09.84.gb.02.da.4.d.1.a, will be removed with release v2018.08!"

[12:17] <melezhik> Actually, I still stuck, what sould I use ?  time -  $*INITTIME // $*INIT-INSTANT ?

[12:19] <lizmat> melezhik: Telemetry wallclock gives microseconds since start of program, perhaps that is what you need ?

[12:19] <melezhik> yes

[12:19] <lizmat> m: use Telemetry; say T<wallclock>

[12:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 49dce163e: OUTPUT: «194540␤»

[12:20] <melezhik> is it core module?

[12:20] <lizmat> you have to -use- it, but it's in the compiler release, just like e.g. Test

[12:22] <melezhik> perl6 -e 'use Telemetry' throws "Could not find Telemetry "

[12:23] <lizmat> which version of rakudo are you using ?

[12:24] <melezhik> This is Rakudo version 2017.06 built on MoarVM version 2017.06

[12:24] <lizmat> I think it's since 2017.11 or 2017.12 ?

[12:24] <lizmat> ah, that explains  :-)

[12:24] <melezhik> ok

[12:24] <melezhik> can I work this around with " $*INITTIME" as Zoffix have suggested ?

[12:25] <lizmat> yeah, sure  :-)

[12:25] <melezhik> I thought I need to substruct  $*INITTIME from current time ...

[12:25] <melezhik> the only thing is how to know this current time?

[12:25] <lizmat> m: say time

[12:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 49dce163e: OUTPUT: «1516796747␤»

[12:25] <lizmat> m: say now

[12:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 49dce163e: OUTPUT: «Instant:1516796794.404767␤»

[12:26] <lizmat> I guess you want now

[12:26] <melezhik> yeah, this would be - "now - $*INITTIME"

[12:27] <melezhik> or  - "now - $*INITTIME//$*INIT-INSTANT"

[12:27] <melezhik> Thanks

[12:28] *** AlexDaniel joined
[12:30] <melezhik> my final version is "(now - $*INITTIME//$*INIT-INSTANT).Int"

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> but it's not just spaces, it's also stuff starting with -

[17:11] *** lizmat joined
[17:12] <tyil> after having spend quite some time with posix sh, I can say that things starting with -, or spaces inside strings have scared me to quote everything I can think of, and add an additional -- argument to almost everything

[17:13] <AlexDaniel> that's the right way to write stuff, yea

[17:13] <tyil> quotes are pretty much always safe to add

[17:14] <AlexDaniel> yes

[17:15] <AlexDaniel> something like this maybe https://github.com/stmuk/rakudup/pull/2

[17:15] * AlexDaniel haven't reviewed it yet actually

[17:16] <tyil> I generally keep the { } with vars because I prefer reading it like that, but they're indeed not needed

[17:16] <tyil> I'd keep the [ ] for tests instead of [[ ]], but also change bash to sh

[17:17] <AlexDaniel> well my logic is that it claims to be bash, then why not use all of the bash features

[17:17] <tyil> ah, they're mixed in the original version

[17:18] <tyil> but I'd still go for [ ] everywhere because I prefer posix sh over bash

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> to be honest I don't know the pitfalls of [ ]

[17:18] <tyil> just add more quotes and you're good

[17:18] <tyil> and use = instead of ==

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> well, but how would you do stuff like “if [[ $DEBUG ]]; then” ?

[17:19] <tyil> if [ "$DEBUG" ]; then, or as I'd probably write it, [ "$DEBUG" ] && do_whatever

[17:20] <tyil> https://github.com/Tyil/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/rc/zshrc#L4 like that, though I seem to even use it unquoted there

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> what about the [ "x$foo" = "x" ] kind of stuff?

[17:20] <tyil> why would I want to use that

[17:20] <tyil> use -n

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> I guess you are right

[17:21] <El_Che> stmuk: rakudo up?

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> and the trick is no longer relevant

[17:21] <El_Che> a wrapper for rakudo star?

[17:22] <tyil> there's a list of all the checks in the posix shell language spec

[17:22] <tyil> same for the param expansion

[17:25] <scimon> Whipped a little something up that I'll hopefully have a use for in work.

[17:25] <scimon> Should appear here soon. Meanwhile I'm heading home.

[17:26] <El_Che> scimon: in my case, the code that have in production it tied to an older rakudo release as it does not longer work with today's rakudo :)

[17:26] <El_Che> it's self contained and it works fine :)

[17:26] <scimon> Oh dear.

[17:26] <El_Che> I haven't bothered "porting"" it because it will be off circulation in some moths

[17:27] <El_Che> it was a service that was required during a cert authority transition

[20:13] * AlexDaniel clickbaits https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls

[20:14] <cono> is there any way to make this more elegant? :) https://glot.io/snippets/exo3p18bgx

[20:14] <cono> the idea is to drop clients if they are not sending anything for 4 seconds

[20:15] *** zakharyas left
[20:15] <AlexDaniel> cono: what about: whenever Promise.in(4) { … }

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> cono: so it will be “whenever { whenever { … } }” which is fine

[20:15] *** zakharyas joined
[20:15] *** Nanjizal joined
[20:16] <cono> but how to drop previous promise if user sent something ?

[20:16] <cono> user => clinet

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> just call done() ?

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> you already do, hmm…

[20:17] <stmuk> AlexDaniel: I suspect anyone with space in their home directory will have greater issues than my crummy script working :)

[20:18] <stmuk> while [ 1 ]; do ./rakudup; sleep 600; done

[20:18] <cono> AlexDaniel: your proposition drops client after first message + 4 seconds, and it doesn't matter if client continue to send something

[20:18] <stmuk> the output doesn't change .. just says "2017.12" :P

[20:18] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: so instead of fixing the code you say “let's hope it works”. It probably will, most of the time, but with that attitude there's no need to fix anything really

[20:19] <stmuk> its fixed now anyway

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> stmuk: cool, then also `git -C "${TMP}"`, `grep .rakudup "${HOME}/.profile", and -- everywhere… Sorry :)

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> I mean, all that was in the pull request

[20:21] <stmuk> I don't care about the dash in directory problem sorry

[20:23] *** sena_kun left
[20:26] *** lizmat left
[20:27] <AlexDaniel> cono: good question actually

[20:28] <jnthn> cono: I'd probably just have a timestamp that I update per message, and then a whenever Supply.interval(1) { ...check time stamp... }

[20:28] <jnthn> Or replace 1 with the margin of error that's acceptable

[20:29] <jnthn> The Promise.in approach isn't really safe

[20:30] <jnthn> Should be whenever Promise.in(4) { ...code from the then block here... }

[20:30] <jnthn> (I mean, Promise.in is fine, but the .then is less so)

[20:31] <jnthn> The other way, though

[20:31] <jnthn> Is to know that whenever returns a tap object

[20:32] <jnthn> You can call .close on that to cancel the previous timeout

[20:32] <jnthn> And keep a "current active timeout tap" variable

[20:32] <jnthn> But gets you your 4 seconds spot-on

[23:28] <jnthn> whenever is like for (statement, not expression), so needs `do`

[23:29] <cono> yeah, made a trick :) But looks like close doesn't work on returned tap object

[23:30] <cono> https://glot.io/snippets/exo94k1tgi

[23:33] <jnthn> Odd, it looks about right. What's the error?

[23:33] <cono> with interval works perfect :) The only thing I'm worry about is internal variable which counts how many times interval happend, don't want it to overflow

[23:33] <cono> jnthn: no error, its just timeouting even if I'm typing in the telnet

[23:33] <jnthn> Oh!

[23:33] <jnthn> You need also to do `done` after $conn.close perhas

[23:33] <jnthn> *perhaps

[23:34] <jnthn> Also you can put the duplicate logic in a sub and call it :)

[23:36] *** GregDonald joined
[23:36] <jnthn> Overflow - pretty sure it's a bigint, but if it isn't it's a 64-bit int, and if you triggered it every millisecond that's 292 million years, and I don't think you'll care then.

[23:36] <cono> done stopping my program totally and do not resolve problem with continous typing

[23:37] <jnthn> oh, duh, done isn't right at all, sorry :)

[23:37] <cono> https://glot.io/snippets/exo9bqvwr6

[23:38] <jnthn> Does it actually print TIMEOUT?

[23:38] <cono> previously I was trying to store promise and cancel it, but it gave me eexception about vowed object all the time

[23:38] <cono> yes

[23:40] <jnthn> Hm

[23:40] <cono> btw, what whenever does, is it something like setting .act/then on a Promise ?

[23:40] *** ChoHag left
[23:40] *** setty1 left
[23:41] <cono> this actually works perfect :) https://glot.io/snippets/exo9fghfdf

[23:41] <jnthn> whenever on a promise will call .Supply on it

[23:41] <jnthn> And it acts like a one-value Supply

[23:42] <cono> but what happens with Supply?

[23:42] <cono> is it tap-in on it?

[23:42] <jnthn> It taps it, yes. It then enforces one message at a time concurrency control across all the whenevers in the react/supply block

[23:43] <jnthn> Meaning that any state that you declare inside of there is safe provided you do all your message processing with whenever

[23:43] <cono> ah, now I'm starting to understand :)

[23:43] <jnthn> Further, it keeps track of the active taps

[23:43] <jnthn> So that if there's an exception or a `done` then it will close all open taps, to prevent resource leaks

[23:43] <cono> so I can create supply and whenever it couple of times?

[23:43] <jnthn> Yes

[23:43] <cono> cool

[23:44] <jnthn> You can even write subs inside of your react/supply block with a whenever inside of them

[23:44] <jnthn> And call those

[23:44] <jnthn> To further factor things out

[23:44] <cono> so all nested whenevers will tie to the outer react block?

[23:44] <jnthn> Yes

[23:44] <cono> double cool :D

[23:45] <cono> jnthn++ thanks! now much clear :)

[23:45] <jnthn> Welcome :)

[23:45] <cono> as for the role Tappable, is only source code I can read to understand it? Couldn't find any documentation

[23:46] *** wamba left
[23:46] <jnthn> Yeah, that's to Supply what Iterator is to Seq

[23:47] <jnthn> I considered it sorta implementation detail so far, though I think it's stable enough by now to test/document and consider part of the language

[23:47] <jnthn> It's relatively rare that you'd implement Tappable directly

[23:48] <jnthn> Much like it's relatively rare to implement the Iterator role directly

[23:49] <cono> so if I want to implement wrapper around supply it would be better to inherit from Supply and override .tap?

[23:50] <cono> as I'm currently thinking about AsyncReadTimeout class, which going to emit line or Nil in case timeout happend

[23:50] <cono> especially with all of these nested whenever magic, I think it would be really easy to make :)

[23:51] <jnthn> I'd just write a sub with a supply block in it

[23:52] <cono> class { method lines { supply { ... MAGIC ... }}} kinda like this?

[23:52] <jnthn> sub timeout(Supply $in, $timeout) { supply { my $last = now; whenever $in { $last = now; emit $_ }; whenever Supply.interval(0.1) { if now - $last > $timeout { die "Timed out" } } } }

[23:52] <jnthn> Roughly, untested :)

[23:52] <cono> wow, nice, thanks! :)

[23:53] <jnthn> We use supply { ... } to write a bunch of the built-in methods on Supply, fwiw :)

[23:53] <cono> and what about die in this code?

[23:53] <cono> ah, looks like I understan

[23:53] <cono> CATCH { $conn.print("TIMEOUT\n"); $conn.close }

[23:53] <jnthn> That will end the stream

[23:53] <jnthn> QUIT rather than CATCH, because it's an async exception

[23:54] <cono> ah, ic

[23:54] <jnthn> Oh, and you need to match on the exception

[23:54] *** comborico1611 left
[23:54] <jnthn> If you want this to be robust, I'd suggest creating a X::ReadTimeout exception or something

[23:54] <jnthn> So that you can when X::ReadTimeout { $con.print("TIMEOUT\n"); $conn.close }

[23:55] <jnthn> So you won't presume very possible error is a timeout

[23:55] <cono> cool :) sooo awesome :)

[23:55] <cono> thanks!

[23:55] <jnthn> supply blocks make writing all kinds of async combinators a decent bit less of a headache, yeah :-)

[23:55] <jnthn> np :)

[23:56] <jnthn> Time for me to go rest; night o/

[23:56] <cono> good night!
