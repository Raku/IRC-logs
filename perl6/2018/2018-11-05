[02:28] <Xliff> lookatme_q: What parameters are you trying to set?

[02:30] *** Kaiepi left
[02:32] <lookatme_q> Xliff, for example,  https://xueqiu.com/stock/screener/screen.json?order=desc, the order

[02:34] <Xliff> I get a json error packet.

[02:35] <Xliff> If you want to change the order parameter? You would just pass that as part of the URI, correct?

[02:36] <Xliff> So... my $resp = await Cro::HTTP::Client.get("https://xueqiu.com/stock/screener/screen.json?order={ $order }");

[02:36] <lookatme_q> Xliff, so I should build the URI myself ?

[02:36] <Xliff> Yes.

[02:37] <lookatme_q> oh, that's ... :/

[02:37] <Xliff> :)

[02:37] <lookatme_q> Xliff, Let me find if there any other module support this :)

[02:37] <Xliff> What do you mean?

[02:38] <Xliff> You want a module that will allow you to pass query parameters as part of the get call?

[02:38] <lookatme_q> I was consider cro first choice :)

[02:38] <lookatme_q> yeah

[02:38] <Xliff> Cro is a good first choice.

[02:38] <Xliff> But building URIs is generally something left to the module's consumer.

[02:38] <Xliff> i.e.: you!

[02:39] <lookatme_q> Hmm, I am well know of WEB things

[02:39] <lookatme_q> not

[02:39] <lookatme_q> okay, anyway thanks Xliff 

[02:40] <Xliff> I have some experience with Cro, so if you get stuck and really want help, let me know.

[02:40] <lookatme_q> Xliff, I will :)

[02:40] <Xliff> The best thing you can do in that situation is writet a sub to build the URL for you based on parameters passed. 

[02:40] <lookatme_q> yeah, I see, I will try it

[02:40] <Xliff> so: buildRequest(%hash)

[02:41] <lookatme_q> hmm

[02:41] <Xliff> Will take %hash( order => desc ) and convert it to https://xueqiu.com/stock/screener/screen.json?order=desc

[02:42] <lookatme_q> okay, Is the cro will encode the URI for me ? Xliff 

[02:42] <lookatme_q> such as replace = to something

[02:42] <Xliff> Yes. Cro should encode the URI

[02:42] <Xliff> If necessary.

[02:42] <Xliff> I say should as I have never had any problems with it.

[02:42] <lookatme_q> okay, that make sense now

[02:42] <Xliff> OK

[02:44] <Xliff> lookatme_q: Now if you have special chars in the value, you should encode THAT yourself.

[02:45] <Xliff> use URI::Escape for that.

[02:46] <Xliff> So: use URI::Escape; %hash = ( param => uri-escape('This value contains an = sign') )

[02:46] <Xliff> That should get you going.

[02:48] <lookatme_q> Xliff, yeah, you are right, the error was reported

[02:48] <lookatme_q> let me try the escape

[04:22] <Zoffix> $ ./perl6 -v

[04:22] <Zoffix> This is Rakudo version 2018.10-76-gd3f0286c3 built on MoarVM version 2018.10-74-g2fdde4a21

[04:22] <Zoffix> implementing Perl 6.d.

[04:22] <Zoffix> dduncan: yeah, bleed already shows it ^

[04:23] <dduncan> Thank you.

[04:23] <Zoffix> dduncan: oh, Rakudo Star.

[04:23] <Zoffix> dduncan: I think the next Rakudo Star is for 2018.10, which is still on v6.c. 

[04:24] <Zoffix> dduncan: and it's not yet known whether there would be an out-of-schedule Rakudo Star 2018.11, but you could always install a compiler only too

[04:24] <dduncan> Yes, my short term use cases for Perl 6 prefer something stable and easy to I use Rakudo Star.

[04:24] <Zoffix> huggable: star

[04:24] <huggable> Zoffix, Estimated Rakudo Star releases: .01, .04, .07 & .10

[04:24] <dduncan> Recent history showed it seems Star isn’t on a fixed 3 month schedule anymore.

[04:26] <dduncan> I’m only just starting to get into Perl 6 development again in the near future, currently aided by Learning Perl 6 to help remind me what changed over the last decade, and at this point I’m inclined to make my efforts cite 6.d as a hard dependency.

[04:27] <dduncan> Since a “stable” 6.d release seems imminent now.

[04:28] <Zoffix> dduncan: the spec already got released 

[04:29] <Zoffix> dduncan: and on 2018-11-18 Rakudo Compiler with 6.d will be released, and after that 2019.01 Rakudo Star might get released with 6.d lang, though if there is a volunteer to do it, there might be an out-of-schedule 2018.11 Rakudo Star release, just to get 6.d to Star users faster.

[04:30] <dduncan> I’m just saying the lowest barrier to entry will be a Rakudo Star that implements the final 6.d spec and that will run code declaring it uses 6.d without error.  Although if a much earlier Rakudo Compiler will do the same thing I might try using that first.

[04:30] <Zoffix> :)

[04:30] <Zoffix> dduncan: what OS are you using?

[04:30] <dduncan> Currently Mac OS 10.13.6 High Sierra.  I find the .dmg Star releases extremely useful.

[04:31] <Zoffix> Ah :)

[04:32] <dduncan> I have regularly compiled Perl 5 from source in the past, and may or may not have done that with Moar or Rakudo sometime in the past, but in the last few years I’ve been content to just take the Star releases when they came out, as that was cutting edge enough.

[04:32] <Zoffix> Cool :)

[04:40] <dduncan> My main intended use case in the short term is to write a port of my Muldis Reference Engine database language VM in it, versions that also do or will exist in several other languages, the very first ended up being .Net Core / C#.  This seemed the right time as, while I want to and did previously support helping find bugs in Perl 6 implementations, right now I’m just wanting to focus on my own bugs and have the Perl 6 be relatively sol

[04:40] <dduncan> and production ready, as much as other common languages.  I believe we’ve reached that point now when Perl 6 can be more vigorously used in production like anything else, and a good time for me to jump back in.

[04:41] <Zoffix> Yeah, totally.

[04:44] <dduncan> I will also mostly be referring to Raku as the implementation language in its documentation, now that Larry has blessed it.  I will also still use the name Perl 6 there enough for less savvy people to know they are 2 names for the same language.

[04:44] <Zoffix> \o/

[04:46] <dduncan> Is there a plan for releases to include a “raku” binary alongside the “perl6” one anytime soon eg officially as part of 6.d support so that people can easily refer to either in their code?

[04:46] <dduncan> Eg, in a shebang line.

[04:47] <Zoffix> No immediate plans.

[04:47] <dduncan> Okay, well that’s less important anyway.

[04:54] <Xliff> What does it mean when you get this error: 

[04:54] <Xliff> say "V: { $gv.string }";

[04:54] <Xliff> Oops. Not that one.

[04:55] *** proc left
[04:57] *** Zoffix left
[05:07] <dduncan> I’m looking for opinions: For someone / myself who were to start implementing a programming language in the Perl 6 / NQP / MoarVM ecosystem such that it is conceptually a sibling language to Perl 6, is there any good reason today to write the implementation in terms of NQP source like Rakudo is, or would that not confer any benefits over writing it just in higher level Perl 6?  Or would perhaps writing it by default in Perl 6 but some 

[05:07] <dduncan> parts in NQP be best, as Rakudo itself seems to be?  I’m operating under the assumption here that NQP is the recommended common denominator here when we want a single implementation to have the kind of VM portability that Rakudo has.

[05:08] <Xliff> dduncan: I would start off writing it in whatever you feel comfortale with, until it is complete.

[05:08] <Xliff> Once you have that reference implementation, it can then be boiled down to NQP.

[05:09] <dduncan> Fair enough.  Currently the first version is in C# as that’s what I’m most comfortable with for the purpose.  I planned to have it fully functional there before porting.

[05:09] <Xliff> So if you want to do pure Perl6, a mix or pure NQP, it really doesn't matter.

[05:09] <Xliff> Yes. That's probably for the best.

[05:09] <dduncan> Thank you for your feedback, sounds good.

[05:09] <Xliff> It's easiest to convert from C# to Perl6 and from there down to NQP.

[05:09] <dduncan> Right.

[06:32] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Do you know why this error pops up? "Cannot resolve caller AUTOGEN(GTK::Image: Str, GTK::Compat::Types::GValue); the following candidates match the type but require mutable arguments:"

[06:32] <Xliff> What does mutability have to do with method matching for multis?

[06:32] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: not excellent, but not bad either...

[06:33] <jmerelo> Xliff: some types are not mutable, I guess... If they are modified in the call, you need to use a mutable type. Str is not mutable, FWIW

[06:34] <Xliff> OK. So that means one of the arguments was somehow immutable and I just need to figure out which one?

[06:34] <jmerelo> Xliff: I'd bet on Str

[06:34] <jmerelo> Xliff: I mean, Str is immutable.

[06:34] <Xliff> Well... no... the Str in that method was never touched.

[06:35] <Xliff> OK. It gives me something to look into. Thanks.

[06:35] <jmerelo> Xliff: that's not the thing. The _type_ is immutable.

[06:35] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: uhhhh you can file a ticket I guess… of course it would be much more awesome if it said which argument was not mutable

[06:35] <Xliff> Yes. That's the problem with that error!

[06:38] *** domidumont left
[06:39] *** kerframil left
[06:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: it was a tough weekend. We'll try better next time.

[06:41] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: can you pick a winner? I mean, if we look at the amount of commits or closed issues, then you have the most, that's true. But then the playing field is a bit not level because you've been working on the doc repo for so much (including grant work)

[06:42] *** aeruder joined
[06:42] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: as I said, not eligible. Who's second?

[06:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aeruder

[06:43] <AlexDaniel> it's hard to tell

[06:44] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: let me see

[06:46] <AlexDaniel> I see chsanch who did two PRs

[06:46] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Zoffix would go second, I guess. And then, in raw commits, I would say MasterDuke.

[06:47] <AlexDaniel> and then Zoffix who did a lot of stuff

[06:47] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: but they are still there, they have not been merged. There's some work to do.

[06:47] <AlexDaniel> (I'm not listing in any particular order)

[06:48] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: same but sorted alphabetically: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/16f5084df6d6c16eb08ea879e66524e6

[06:50] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kensanata

[06:50] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Zoffix and Coke are the ones with the most commits. Maybe Coke?

[06:50] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commits?author=coke

[06:50] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Let's go for Coke...

[06:51] <AlexDaniel> but but, hold on :)

[06:52] <AlexDaniel> I can't quite figure out which of these commits were during the squashathon

[06:53] <AlexDaniel> because squashable6-- doesn't log the commit title

[06:53] <jmerelo> Coke did 7 during the squashathon

[06:54] <AlexDaniel> and Zoffix did 10

[06:55] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: let's give it then to Zoffix. I didn't pick that one because maybe he's not eligible either. But whatever.

[06:55] <AlexDaniel> why not?

[06:55] <jmerelo> Same reason I'm not.

[06:55] <jmerelo> But, as I say, whatever. He's done good work, let's go with that.

[06:56] *** domidumont joined
[06:56] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v domidumont

[06:59] <AlexDaniel> please someone make 100 PRs next time!

[06:59] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel++

[07:01] <AlexDaniel> eh, I'm still looking at contributions…

[07:04] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: we should maybe do this automatically. Exclude non-eligible people, and maybe have a scoreboard during the squashathon

[07:04] <AlexDaniel> I disagree that there's a lot of people to exclude :)

[07:05] <AlexDaniel> in fact I'd prefer rakudo devs to participate more than they do

[07:05] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I'm not say there's a lot. Just that it's a non-zero measure set.

[07:05] <AlexDaniel> there's one thing though. The text used to say that it'll go to someone who makes most/best PRs

[07:06] <AlexDaniel> and I'm thinking… chsanch did two, one was merged and closed a ticket, another one was not merged but I'm fine with that

[07:06] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: to encourage those who don't have a commit bit...

[07:07] *** HaraldJoerg joined
[07:07] <AlexDaniel> sure but those who have a commit bit are not very encouraged, unfortunately :)

[07:07] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: let's do the scoreboard and then we decide. It's not as easy as just tally the number of commits.

[09:27] <El_Che> hi lizmat 

[09:28] <lizmat> o/

[09:28] <woolfy> Thank you for making this possible.  Thank you for destroying the work of many years, trying to build some widespread knowledge about the name "Perl 6".  People are now stopping to use "Perl 6" and using "Raku".

[09:29] <woolfy> So, yes, I just left the Perl 5 community, because nobody stepped up against using a new made meme by Karen Etheridge, using Martin Luther King, using his texts that were aimed at white oppression of black people.

[09:29] <woolfy> Anybody with a shred of knowledge of history, knows that you just don't use Martin Luther King this way.

[09:30] <woolfy> And Perl 5 people who accuse Perl 6 people this way of oppressing Perl 5, subduing Perl 5...  well, it is nasty.

[09:31] <woolfy> I am so tremendously angry, even after a bad night's sleep, you have no idea how angry I am with Zoffix and Larry and Karen Etheridge and ribasushi and all those people who did this and what followed after it.

[09:31] <woolfy> I am no longer supporting Perl 5.

[09:31] <woolfy> I wanted to stop supporting Perl 6 too, but lizmat stopped me.

[09:32] <woolfy> But this, https://makeameme.org/meme/free-at-last-5bdf36?d_ , this is the result of the work of Zoffix, and I am angry as hell.  Did you really not see this coming?  And there's more stuff like this, and it will get worse, and it is bad marketing, and it is very bad for Perl 6 and for Perl as a whole.

[09:32] <El_Che> woolfy: calm down, order your thoughts, write a blogposts, review it and post it after the anger has diminished. I have trouble getting what is your opinion and what's somene leses (specially the p5 part)

[09:33] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: I am calm, and my thoughts are ordered, and I do not need this advise from you.  You have said some nasty things the last couple of days and I am damn angry at you too.

[09:34] <El_Che> Am I nasty? wow

[09:34] <ufobat> i think the MLK picture is indeed not okay

[09:34] <El_Che> Aren't you confusing opinions with nastyness?

[09:34] <El_Che> s/y/i

[09:35] <El_Che> I make an effort *not* to be nasty

[09:35] <woolfy> Well done.

[09:35] <lizmat> I think you misunderstand the depth of the insult that the MLK meme means to woolfy (or me, for that matter)

[09:36] <El_Che> lizmat: I don't see what I have to do with the MLK meme which I have never seen in my life until woolfy joined

[09:36] * lizmat still has to backlog

[09:37] <El_Che> lizmat, woolfy: I feel fine to be confronted with what I say or do. But I don't see the connection here, and I honnestly I don't see my "nastiness".

[09:47] <CIAvash> About the conference: I think what TimToady said in the past is relevant https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2016-01-08#l2242 https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2016-01-08#l2260

[09:54] *** dduncan joined
[09:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dduncan

[09:56] <dduncan> What’s the cause of the formatting of this message?  https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-11-03#l276  Something so important, why is “TimToady” indented into the message column rather than being in the left column where the speaker name of the message normally is.  It almost makes it look like it was a quotation rather than a direct post.

[09:57] <moritz> dduncan: seems like a /me action

[09:57] <yoleaux> 03:13Z <Zoffix> moritz: would you retween on perl6org, please? https://twitter.com/zoffix/status/1059282015885889536

[09:57] * AlexDaniel test test

[09:57] <AlexDaniel> yeah https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-11-05#l472

[10:00] <dduncan> Yeah so the /me caused that formatting.  But what does it mean semantically?  Why do that rather than speaking normally?  Is it like a bookmark to highlight more important comments?

[10:05] <AlexDaniel> dduncan: you can use it when you do something. Compare “dduncan wonders why the formatting is different” and “<dduncan> I wonder why the formatting is different”

[10:05] <dduncan> I see, its about talking about yourself in the third person.

[10:05] *** Skarsnik joined
[10:05] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[10:06] <AlexDaniel> you explained it better than I did :)

[10:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Skarsnik

[10:06] <dduncan> That makes sense.  Still, for those not used to it, the formatting almost made it look like the quote was someone else saying Larry said it rather than Larry saying it himself, seeming less authentic.

[10:07] <dduncan> Eg I’d hate for it to be cited given the current arguments about Raku, someone raising, Larry didn’t actually say that.

[10:08] <dduncan> But that’s probably just me.

[10:09] <timotimo> at least weechat displays the names of people on the right-hand-side of the nickname/message separator, though in my case it also puts a * on the left

[10:09] <timotimo> and the name being colored in hopefully also gives a hint to make it a bit clearer

[10:09] <Skarsnik> timotimo, where is your profiler? x) *should favorite some stuff sometime*

[10:12] <tobs`> Zoffix: in the brochure, under "Upgrade info": "The ChangeLog on the pages that follow—where possible—gives details on the alternative code to use," <- has a trailing comma

[10:12] <lizmat> El_Che: ^^^

[10:15] <lizmat> calling someone who has a. written the most Perl 6 books, b. has organized the most Perl events *EVER*, of which *TWO* YAPC::Europe's almost single-handedly in the past

[10:15] <timotimo> Skarsnik: https://github.com/timo/moarperf

[10:15] <marcusr> lizmat: https://twitter.com/perlcon/status/1059353130129874944 this is pretty childish :(

[10:15] <lizmat> because no group in the Perl community could get it together that year

[10:15] <timotimo> i'm looking forward to a star from you :)

[10:16] <lizmat> also: having been involved with organizing 2 YAPC::EU myself

[10:17] <lizmat> I can understand how uncertainty about the language can make you think twice about risking money for such an event

[10:17] <Skarsnik> it will get lost on my 200 tabs in chrome!

[10:17] <timotimo> lizmat: do we know who made the tasteless MLK meme?

[10:17] <lizmat> yes: Karen Etheridge, one of the p5p core members

[10:17] <timotimo> Skarsnik: maybe i should register a fresh & fancy domain

[10:18] <Skarsnik> na it's fine xD

[10:19] <timotimo> i don't think i know anything about her, i have no clue whether she'd just selected MLK on a whim or actually meant anything more by it than "he's a guy who talks about freedom a lot"

[10:20] <Skarsnik> the real question: what is the root password of my vps xD

[10:21] <tobs`> Zoffix: The heading "ChangeLog(cont)" on the *first* changelog page shouldn't have "(cont)", should it?

[10:21] <marcusr> It's a meme, so there's lots of variants of this picture https://www.google.com/search?q=free+at+last+meme&safe=off&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=VrZJUvaPatiCsM%253A%252CdEyzHh7nLQD1tM%252C_&usg=AI4_-kTySIGwyogqJPhRedqMJYL0jnt5Sg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwitoevOg73eAhXMDSwKHUaSBzYQ9QEwAHoECAUQBA#imgrc=fEH9Kkck4aQm6M:

[10:21] <tadzik> huh, prompt wasn't in 6.c? Never noticed :)

[10:22] <timotimo> marcusr: of course, but when you make one for yourself, you'll inevitably be confronted with what the original picture meant, i think?

[10:23] <tadzik> I think it's one of the cases when someone often exposed to something does not take it at face-value anymore

[10:23] <timotimo> that's quite possible

[10:24] <tadzik> as in: regular memers don't even see MLK in there, he's the form, not the... treść

[10:24] <tadzik> how do you english that without coffee...

[10:24] <tadzik> form, not the actual content?

[10:24] <tadzik> I had a similar conversation about violence in computer games yesterday :)

[10:24] <dduncan> I think the MLK meme is in bad taste and it should be retracted.

[10:26] <timotimo> gotta go!

[10:26] <timotimo> n'est ceci un martìn

[10:27] * timotimo knows approximately 0 frenchs

[10:28] <Skarsnik> like most people that are not french ^^

[10:37] <Juerd> Skarsnik: I don't know about other countries, but at least in the Netherlands it's common to receive some French in school

[10:38] <Juerd> I never liked these classes because it didn't seem like a language I'd ever use, but it's proven practical to be able to read at least some things.

[10:38] <AlexDaniel> here we had to choose between German and French

[10:38] <Juerd> I mostly still don't understand why we had to learn moisonneuse-batteuse though.

[10:39] <Juerd> The words we had to learn were so incredibly random :(

[10:39] <Skarsnik> it's like Spannish in Europe, it's mostly useless unless you go to Spain

[10:40] <Juerd> Skarsnik: Knowing a little bit of French has proven useful mostly for understanding French people who (try to) speak English :D

[10:40] <Skarsnik> haha true

[10:40] <huf> it helps you pronounce the french names you encounter in books though

[10:40] <Juerd> Deciphering the accent, understanding why they use a different word order

[10:40] <Skarsnik> We (french) are so bad in English

[10:42] *** kerframil left
[10:42] <Skarsnik> it's mainly because English is teached very academicly, you learn lot of grammar rules and such and barerly actually write/speak English

[10:42] <Juerd> Skarsnik: That's how French is taught here, and indeed, that doesn't work :)

[10:47] <ribasushi_> a note for posterity, as woolfy mentioned me in the same line as ether: I was one of the first ( 2 mins in ) to downvote Karen's braindead comment, and am pretty sure she doesn't even realize the irony of her expressing an opinion on "problems community is unable to solve by itself"

[10:49] *** ribasushi_ left
[10:50] <El_Che> lizmat: no one is saying the guy has done nothing (I wrote how a nice gesture it was to organize the event when there where no other candidate). The fact remains that he's making a threat to take his ball home because of something he doesn't like. "Unprofessional" is the nicer way of putting it.

[10:50] <Skarsnik> I am sure Raku will be sell as a fork of Perl 6 x)

[10:51] <Skarsnik> I am so annoyed to have this type of error : Cannot locate native library 'libssl.so'

[10:51] *** noganex left
[10:51] <tadzik> I think it remains to be seen what Raku will end up being, if anything at all in practice

[10:52] <Skarsnik> it's not like I made a way to pass an ABI version so we don't have to install devel package :(

[10:52] <tadzik> and truth of the matter is, >90% of the perl community don't really care. Hell, I am among the few who even write Perl 6 sometimes and I changes little about my life. Putting the whole conference in jeopardy becuase of a phantom threat (imho) is, like El_Che said, unprofessional

[10:53] <tadzik> which is always surprising to see from people who've been extremely professional before

[10:58] <dduncan> We really need to wait for Larry to come back from his vacation, digest the fallout of his “Raku, final answer" declaration, and for him to post a thoughtful response to the community addressing people's concerns.  I look forward to seeing that.

[11:05] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[11:05] <dduncan> I said at least 2 things you might have been replying to.

[11:06] <pmurias> El_Che: more people have been annoyed by the alias, so we have real drawbacks of something that will most likely have very little benefit

[11:06] <dduncan> But both of my comments referred to things multiple people people had big issues with.

[11:07] <dduncan> The MLK thing should be retracted.  The alias thing Larry just needs to explain his intentions better.

[11:09] <dduncan> Or rather, I think he already explained the alias thing, basically he’s blessing a specific alias, and its up to the community members to use either as they wish.  So its more that I’m hoping he will comment further on how people actually reacted to the “final answer” announcement.

[11:15] <kensanata> Skarsnik: From my README: "When installing dependencies using zef as shown, you could be running into an OpenSSL issue even if you have the correct development libraries installed. On Debian, you need libssl-dev but apparently versions 1.1.0f and 1.1.0g won't work. See issue #34. You could decide to ignore SSL support and opt to have a web server act as a proxy which provides SSL."

[11:15] <yoleaux> 29 Oct 2018 18:02Z <AlexDaniel> kensanata: how is it going? I wanna switch something to oddmuse6 and I wonder if that'd be a good idea any time soon

[11:16] <kensanata> Skarsnik: And: "In which case there is a terrible workaround available: run zef install --force-test IO::Socket::Async::SSL before you zef install XXX." Heh.

[11:35] <Zoffix> woolfy, a quote from my letter to Larry: "However, I believe such an alias has a more immediate application closer to home, by improving the wellbeing of the existing community and the interactions of its members with other programming communities, including the Perl 5 community."

[11:37] <Zoffix> woolfy, the direct result I've seen so far is prominent Perl 5 community members, some of whom were so vile in the past I had them blocked, have shown support for Raku language. I think that's tremendous progress. The only "destruction" I witnessed is you saying you no longer support Perl 5, lizmat admitting that sister language narative is incompatible with her, and Andrew making a fool out of himself by

[11:37] <Zoffix> blocking YAPC::Europe and making strange demands.

[11:37] <Zoffix> woofly: why are you guys doing it? No doom that you predicted showed up, so you decided to fuck shit up yourself?

[11:38] <Zoffix> woofly: you can be angry with me all you want, but may I remind you the final decision was rendered by Larry. Saying you're angree with me because we now have alias discredits Larry's ability to make sound decisions.

[11:39] <Zoffix> tobs: thanks for the corrections, but I think all minor stuff will stay in it, as it's already been "published"

[11:47] <pmurias> Zoffix: Perl 6 haters liking a decision isn't progress of any kind

[11:47] <sacomo> hi all

[11:48] <tadzik> hello sacomo 

[11:48] <pmurias> Zoffix: a lot of them are celebrating because they want Perl 6 dead

[11:49] <sacomo> hi tadzik

[11:49] *** Skarsnik left
[11:52] *** ChoHag left
[11:53] <sacomo> for the record, I like raku. are there any other languages, historical, that have an alias that became the common label for its language?

[11:53] <sacomo> for the record, I like 'Perl 6' too

[11:54] <marcusr> pmurias: as someone who has been blocked by zoffix, that's definitively not the case for me.

[11:56] <tadzik> I think it's easy to label people as haters, but worthwhile to think about where their hate is rooted

[11:57] <lizmat> PSA: there will be no Perl 6 Weekly written by me this week

[11:58] <lizmat> I don't think I would be doing a good job this week

[11:58] <tadzik> :(

[11:58] <sacomo> :(

[11:58] <tadzik> if they want perl 6 dead because they see its name as something inhibiting their own progress, you may (and I do) consider it to be a silly reason to hate something, they are humans just like us who have certain goals they want to achieve

[11:58] <lizmat> I think I'm goig to spend those 6-8 hours a week that it costs me on something a bit more rewarding

[11:59] <tadzik> if we can help them achieve those goals while taking the haters out of them, we all win

[11:59] <sacomo> lizmat, is there anything I can help with?

[11:59] *** Zoffix joined
[11:59] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[12:00] <tadzik> lizmat: I'm sad to hear about no weekly, but I hope you have a wonderful, enjoyable day instead, you really deserve it :)

[12:00] <Zoffix> pmurias: it is tremendous progress, as now our language promotion efforts don't need to also counteract their dispromotion

[12:01] *** ChoHag joined
[12:01] <Zoffix> I'm glad to hear about the weekly. As useful as it is, it's too much work and will get even worse the more popular the language becomes. Make it a Monthly.

[12:01] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ChoHag

[12:02] <Zoffix> pmurias: you're stopping too soon in that description: "they want Perl 6 dead… because its mere name implies the language they make money with is dead". If we eliminate the reason for them wanting it dead, it's progress.

[12:02] *** woolfy joined
[12:02] <sacomo> tadzik, Zoffix, I agree. If some people are getting hung up over the "Perl" part of Perl 6, well, now they have one less roadblock to adoption. If they are just hating to hate, so be it, a different name isn't going to win them over. 

[12:03] <Zoffix> pmurias: and here's the evidence to go with the claim: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-11-04#l856

[12:03] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v woolfy

[12:04] <lizmat> sacomo: no, thank you for offerinng

[12:04] <tadzik> sacomo: the way I see it, we get so rallied up about the name that it's distracting us from actual progress

[12:04] <sacomo> lizmat, np, ping me anytime

[12:05] <tadzik> yes, there are people who hate the name and the language,but there are also people who are insterested in what the language *does*

[12:05] <tadzik> Zoffix brought up the example of people to whom they have to explain that the language they use is not dead, and it's not that old Perl, and it's not that vapourware because it exists etc

[12:05] <sacomo> tadzik, I agree. My Japanese wife likes raku, btw. She said it sounds fun (楽)

[12:05] <tadzik> which is relevant and I can relate

[12:06] <tadzik> then again, I often talk to people who say "oh, so Perl is not dead? Cool! What cool things have been written in it recently?"

[12:06] <tadzik> and all I can show them is CPAN which literally only Perl people care about because it's building blocks and not actual tools

[12:06] <marcusr> tadzik: there are actually several cool newish perl projects.

[12:06] <pmurias> Zoffix: an alias doesn't eliminate the reason it's still Perl 6 with a "Raku" nickname

[12:07] <tadzik> meanwhile I get dozens of people whom I teach python (yeah :/), who only want to learn it because of that jupyter thing being cool

[12:07] <sacomo> Zoffix, I am glad that you persisted with this language topic. I was following from the sidelines, and for me it personally doesn't matter what name is used, but it is obvious that for some people it was a sticking point. The new 6.d announcement pdf looks great too.

[12:07] <tadzik> I think a polished product would do more good to our language than any name can

[12:07] <tadzik> and so if we can stop distracting ourselves with naming and just direct the efforts to building cool shit, we win

[12:08] <Zoffix> sacomo: thanks.

[12:08] <tadzik> nobody mistakes C# for a C++ replacement, there isn't even a discussion. They just both independently build stuff, and built things are unmistakable: they show things as alive and healthy

[12:09] * tadzik bbl

[12:10] <marcusr> https://github.com/trending/perl?since=monthly like diff so fancy, and xattacker, and Trizen (Arch package manager https://github.com/trizen/trizen). One of my nix friends (who's not a perl person) linked me https://github.com/thoughtpolice/eris/blob/master/readme.org as well,

[12:11] <marcusr> Would love to see more cool stuff at https://github.com/trending/perl6 too.

[12:12] <sacomo> One thing I noticed about devs here in Japan is that Perl-hate isn't really a thing, like seems to be in other parts of the world. The issue here is that a lot of the devs are just using other languages for their day-to-day stuff. When I bring up Perl 6 here it usually triggers sincere interest. 

[12:12] <Zoffix> Well, with 6.d outta the door, I think it's time for a little vacay for me

[12:22] <sacomo> pmurias: do you think talking about 'raku' in Poland will go further than 'Perl 6'?

[16:11] <dakkar> Hi. I was looking at https://github.com/perlpilot/p6-IO-Notification-Recursive/blob/master/lib/IO/Notification/Recursive.pm and I was surprised that a `whenever` block will find the `supply` block via the call chain, instead of lexically

[16:11] <dakkar> is that documented anywhere?

[16:12] <dakkar> https://docs.perl6.org/language/concurrency#whenever says «The whenever keyword can be used in supply blocks or in react blocks» and usually I read "in blocks" to mean lexically, not dynamically

[16:13] <dakkar> (now that I think of it, gather/take works the same way)

[16:13] <dakkar> (but at least https://docs.perl6.org/language/control#gather/take says «gather/take is scoped dynamically»)

[16:14] <timotimo> i do think on v6.d a whenever outside of the supply block will asplode

[16:14] <jnthn> dakkar: The docs are correct as of 6.d: from then on, it's only lexically that works

[16:14] <dakkar> oooh

[16:14] <tadzik> hm, having two numbers, like 4:30, can I easily make a duration of 4 hours and 30 minutes?

[16:14] <jnthn> It was accidentally more liberal in 6.c, which frustrated some significant optimizations.

[16:14] <tadzik> and by duration I mean Duration :)

[16:14] <dakkar> jnthn: good to know! so IO::Notification::Recursive would have to be rewritten with explicit taps

[16:14] <tadzik> it sounds like it'd be a good fit for it, though as I look at the docs I may prefer to roll something out myself

[16:15] <timotimo> tadzik: reverse it and use Z* :)

[16:16] <tadzik> :o

[16:16] <dakkar> jnthn: this https://www.thenautilus.net/cgit/Ultramarine/tree/lib/Ultramarine/Model/DirScanner.pm6 is how I solved the "watch directories, recursively" problem. I suspect that it works only because the GC never runs in my tests

[16:17] <tadzik> timotimo: well, I kind of did that (but without Z*) and got myself the int of minutes :)

[16:17] <dakkar> in particular, I fear that I'm not retaining the supplies returned by .watch() (or the taps) anywhere

[16:17] <tadzik> which is fitting, since I apparently already have a multi that formats those too

[16:18] <dakkar> are my fears correct? how would I write a test to catch similar problems?

[16:21] <jnthn> dakkar: The problem with not retaining the taps is actually that you never close them, and so things live forever and are never collected...

[16:21] <jnthn> I strongly suggest using `supply`/`whenever` for such things

[16:21] *** tobs` left
[16:21] <dakkar> oh, so active taps are not collected?

[16:22] <jnthn> No, because they are held onto "form the top", if you like

[16:22] <dakkar> wow, there's way too much I don't know about the memory model / gc part of perl6

[16:22] <jnthn> Bit tied up with debugging something at the moment but here's how I did the recursive watching thing: https://github.com/croservices/cro/blob/master/lib/Cro/Tools/Services.pm6#L159

[16:22] <dakkar> I should have known that Cro would contain answers ☺

[16:23] <dakkar> thank you for the explanation and pointers

[16:23] <jnthn> Well, Supply is the dual of an iterable, so most things work "the other way around". With iterable things, if you lose interest you just let go and the GC eats it. With a supply, you need to unsubscribe to stop the listener or whatever at the top of the chain.

[16:23] *** cognominal-p6 left
[16:24] <jnthn> It's not that they're GC special, just that they're being held on to by the event loop

[16:24] <dakkar> also, a bit I had misunderstood: "`whenever` must be lexically inside `supply`" does not prevent using `whenever` inside subs, as long as they're declared iside the `supply` (in other words, `sub {}` does not break "lexical containment", and why should it?)

[16:29] <jnthn> Correct. :)

[16:30] <jnthn> Also note that sub foo() { whenever $blah { foo() } } is not actually recursive, because `whenever` is async :)

[16:31] <dakkar> that too

[16:47] <[Coke]> This function is mostly identical to the C library sprintf and printf functions. The only difference between the two functions is that sprintf returns a string while the printf function writes to a filehandle. sprintf returns a Str, not a literal.

[16:47] <[Coke]> from Str.sprintf docs. I'm thinking it seems silly to say a method isn't returning a literal.

[16:48] <kybr> i'm reading through the diwali release pamphlet. we can call it raku, perl 6, or raku perl 6. cool. i noticed some mentions of QuantHash, which i have not encountered before. i'm trying to fine examples that use it and a more detailed description than whats on the docs page. link?

[16:49] <jmerelo> [Coke]: right. And printf also returns something, only we don't use it. how can you even return a literal?

[16:49] <jmerelo> kybr: if it's not in the docs page or it's no enough, that's where it should be. Please raise an issue.

[17:06] <[Coke]> yes, after the release, which I didn't think had happened yet.

[17:06] <[Coke]> ^^ jmerelo 

[17:07] <SmokeMachine> this is what Im trying: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/moving/examples/ticket/index.p6

[17:08] <jmerelo> [Coke]: sorry, I just clicked stupidly in merge instead of comment.

[17:08] <SmokeMachine> this is what happens:

[17:09] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: you've consumed the Sequence

[17:10] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: thats not a seq...

[17:10] <SmokeMachine> and that happens even if I only do the last one...

[17:11] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: it generates an iterator when you "for" it. You could copy it to a list, or use "map" or some other function that does not do that.

[17:12] <SmokeMachine> yes... I could... but it should be lazy...

[17:12] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: until you iterate.

[17:12] <SmokeMachine> and that were working some time ago...

[17:19] <SmokeMachine> and, what the me.tickets.Seq do is: `Seq.new: me.tickets.iterator`

[17:20] <SmokeMachine> and ResultSeq creates a new iterator each time you ask for one...

[17:22] *** lizmat left
[17:23] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: but if it's a lazy sequence and it's been iterated, that's it. I mean, look at the error. What's your interpretation for it?

[17:28] <jmerelo> It's not consuming the Seq...

[18:17] *** sauvin left
[18:18] <lizmat> imagine a Robert Zimmerman announcing that was also going to use Bob Dylan as a stage name in the early 60's

[18:18] <lizmat> a stage name only works its intended purpose if people do *not* know what the real name is

[18:19] <jmerelo> lizmat: but we all have stage names. I am JJ in GitHub, jmerelo here, jjmerelo elsewhere... I use other stage names in some other places.

[18:19] <Xliff> These days, most stage names are out there for the public to find, if they want to.

[18:19] <lizmat> I would consider those nick names rather than stage names

[18:20] <lizmat> like Rakudo has been a de-facto nickname for Perl 6 for years already

[18:20] <jmerelo> lizmat: well, Rakudo was rather limited to the compiler. 

[18:20] <Xliff> It's marketing. The truth is always flexible.

[18:20] <jmerelo> Xliff++

[18:21] <lizmat> jmerelo: just as jmerelo is limited to IRC here

[18:21] <Xliff> Let people think the name has been changed. If it gets Perl 6 out there, then it has served its purpose.

[18:21] <jmerelo> lizmat: OK, let's say Raku is a nickname reserver for marketing purposes.

[18:21] <lizmat> of which the marketing was botched from the start :-(

[18:22] <jmerelo> lizmat: I mean, I've seen more people talking about Perl 6 in the last few days in social networks that I'd ever seen.

[18:23] <jmerelo> lizmat: thing is, TimToady made his choice. Might not be the wisest, or might not be the best thing that a choice had to be made.

[18:23] <lizmat> options for TimToady:

[18:23] <lizmat> - decide there is not going to be a stage name

[18:24] <lizmat> - decide there *is* going to be a stage name, but also describe how that would need to be implemented

[18:24] <lizmat> - communicate

[18:25] <jmerelo> the third one is definitely a must. Second, too. I don't see the first happening. He could have simply refused to choose any stage name.

[18:26] *** ExtraCrispy left

[18:29] <El_Che> lizmat: there is a HUGE difference between campaining against or opposing the alias and throwing a tantrum and kill the biggest Perl conference in Europe.

[18:30] <lizmat> El_Che: I think "throwing a tantrum" is uncalled for

[18:30] <El_Che> I respect other opinions. I dislike childish behaviour and I won't risk my money or my reputation within the company (if I take a collegue) on an event with an unknown future

[18:30] <El_Che> really?

[18:30] <lizmat> previously you mentioned the "sad state" that a single person can apparently "kill" a conference

[18:31] <El_Che> "Take back your alias or something could happen to your nice conference"

[18:31] <El_Che> you know what? He can have it

[18:31] <lizmat> El_Che: so you're going to organize the next european Perl conference ?

[18:31] <El_Che> lizmat: NO ONE is

[18:32] <lizmat> if so, I suggest you get in touch with the YEF venue committee

[18:32] *** |oLa| joined

[18:32] <lizmat> so what does that tell about Perl ?

[18:32] <El_Che> sigh

[18:32] <El_Che> that we need an alias in order not to die?

[18:32] <El_Che> that we depend on unreliable persons?

[18:32] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v |oLa|

[18:32] <El_Che> all pretty depressing

[18:33] <El_Che> you see, my problem is not with people disliking the alias

[18:35] <El_Che> I don't understand how you fail to see how unacceptable it is for a single individual to kill a conference

[18:36] <El_Che> that is the fact in this matter

[18:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v atweiden-air

[18:36] <El_Che> not about liking of disliking an alias

[18:37] <AlexDaniel> I really don't get it. “like Rakudo has been a de-facto nickname for Perl 6 for years already”… so “Rakudo” is fine, but we take away two letters and say that this is now official, not just de-facto, and suddenly it is the end of the world?

[18:38] *** |oLa| left
[18:38] <El_Che> https://twitter.com/perlcon/status/1059353130129874944: "The conference is unpaused if Raku is unannounced." 

[18:39] <El_Che> so, if you don't do what I say, I kill the whole thing

[18:39] <lizmat> El_Che: as long as we deem it acceptable as a community to have a *SINGLE* person come forward to organize the European Perl Conference when *NO OTHER PERL GROUP IN EUROPE* was able to come up with an alternative

[18:39] <El_Che> closer than "I take my ball home" you won't get

[18:39] <El_Che> lizmat: that was a *very* nice gestur

[18:39] <El_Che> e

[18:39] <lizmat> El_Che: I think that person has the right to call it quits if that person deems the financial risk to become too large

[18:39] <El_Che> but as it turns out, an empty one

[18:39] <El_Che> wasted everyone's time

[18:40] <El_Che> yes, that would be better

[18:40] <lizmat> El_Che: not to mention his own time: having been over there already to sign contracts, canvas the area, work out arrangements

[18:40] <El_Che> to officially cancel it instead of playing a threatening game

[18:40] <El_Che> a lot of people don't like to play that kind of games

[18:40] <lizmat> those people should then get into the "organize a Perl event" game

[18:41] <lizmat> and find out how appreciated it is

[18:41] <El_Che> rather no event, than a non-event with a twitter account

[18:41] <El_Che> in the end, it's the same without the drama

[18:43] <El_Che> lizmat: so, as I understand it, you are ok with someone calling the conference off until something he can not decide on (Larry did) is withdrown?

[18:43] <El_Che> it's difficult to grasp

[18:44] <Xliff> Whenever anyone gets a chance, I could use some help.

[18:44] <lizmat> I'm ok with him waiting for clarity on how this will start to play out

[18:44] <Xliff> (yes... it's the GTK thing again, but it's self contained... I promise!)

[18:44] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/b98f00d931942b62367fafc65ad3c737

[18:44] <lizmat> and yes, if he should decide he doesn't like the odds, then yes, he can cancel the event

[18:45] <El_Che> so, you're ok with the threat?

[18:45] <atweiden-air> El_Che: where can we read more about larry's statements in regards to raku?

[18:45] <lizmat> and give the Perl community a chance to come up with an alternative in the coming *TEN* months

[18:45] <El_Che> atweiden-air: on the logs of this channel

[18:46] <El_Che> besides the twitter tantrum, the reactions are been pretty OK

[18:46] <lizmat> El_Che: I can *understand* the reasoning on why he's holding back on further investing in this conference until there is clarity (in *his* opinion)

[18:46] <El_Che> but again, I am not pissed off about people being against an alias

[18:47] <El_Che> but about people making threats if the community doesn't do as he says (he uses "we" on twitter, but it's a "he")

[18:47] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: he actually has not paused organising it.  He said he would do it, but actually, he just went on.  If you would have paid attention, you would have seen he has posted information.  He has been busy with development of tickets and prices, and more.

[18:48] <El_Che> I respect an opposed opinion, I react badly to threats

[18:48] <El_Che> I paid attention, as I wrote what I think on twitter directly to the person

[18:50] <lizmat> that there won't be a conference there?

[18:50] <woolfy> If anyone is taking a risk, it is Shitov.

[18:50] <El_Che> lost of money, time and reputation at work

[18:51] <lizmat> you cannot even register for the conference yet?

[18:51] <El_Che> everyone is talking risk getting tickets to a conference that may or may not happen

[18:51] <El_Che> plain

[18:51] <El_Che> hotels

[18:51] <El_Che> time-off of works

[18:51] <lizmat> you cannot even register for the conference yet?

[18:51] <El_Che> see if collegues can come with

[18:51] <El_Che> lizmat: that's not how conferences work in companies

[18:51] <woolfy> Shitov wrote three (!) books about Perl 6, and hoped it would be a success.  he was the first one to write any good Perl 6 book.  Huge financial risk.  This is his third European Perl conference he organises, each time a big financial risk.  He knows a lot about taking financial risks.

[18:51] <El_Che> lizmat: you need to ask for them well in advance

[18:52] <El_Che> so they can book tickets, plan around it etc

[18:52] <pyrimidine> speaking as someone who is pretty neutral on this, I read shitov's tweet pretty much as El_Che describes it (a threat). May not have been meant that way, but that's what came across to me

[18:52] <El_Che> if I am going on a personal account, I won't wait until the last minutes to get a plain ticket as they become expensive

[18:52] *** andrzejku joined
[18:52] <woolfy> The success of his books and his new conference depend on the name of Perl 6.  If that is going to be Raku, going to stay Raku, why would people sponsor a Perl conference where Raku is going to be.

[18:53] <El_Che> lol

[18:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v andrzejku

[18:53] <El_Che> his conference will fail if someone use the Raku alias? Then it *deserves* to fail HARD

[18:53] <El_Che> that is really nonsense

[18:54] <El_Che> perl 5 people don't give a rat's ass about Raku or Perl 6

[18:54] <El_Che> and the wider world don't give a rat's ass about Perl 6 because they think it's good old Perl 5

[18:54] <atweiden-air> El_Che: they don't?

[18:56] <andrzejku> he is who?

[18:56] <andrzejku> here

[18:56] <El_Che> it will be the *same* 200 people that attend the perl conference that will go to riga

[18:56] <El_Che> don't act alike you're organising the next dockercon

[18:56] <El_Che> (which I am attending by the way :) )

[18:56] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ryn1x

[18:56] <El_Che> andrzejku: he declared he will never visit a perl 6 channel ever

[18:57] <andrzejku> ops

[18:57] <El_Che> (talking about tantrums)

[18:57] <andrzejku> why?

[18:57] <andrzejku> he is busy

[18:57] <El_Che> while the discussion was very civilized

[18:57] <El_Che> because he didn't get what he wanted (the alias to be removed)

[18:59] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v natrys

[18:59] <pyrimidine> andrzejku: might check out #moarvm I think

[19:00] <El_Che> sorry, I was talking about https://twitter.com/perlcon and not about jnthn :)

[19:00] <lizmat> Xliff: sorry, but that's a bit above my head

[19:00] <andrzejku> that nice

[19:00] <andrzejku> Perl Conference

[19:01] <andrzejku> but I have small kids and my wife will not let me go : (

[19:04] <El_Che> andrzejku: I enjoyed the ones I attended a lot. I am not as difficult as my rant above would suggest :)

[19:05] <andrzejku> El_Che: nice, are you Perl developer by profession?

[19:05] <El_Che> The Perl conferences are the nicest one I have attended, maybe that why I was triggered. If other conference don't look interesting I just skip them without a second thought

[19:05] <El_Che> andrzejku: I have had different roles on different places

[19:06] <andrzejku> El_Che: ahh

[19:06] <andrzejku> El_Che: I attend only in small Linux Conference

[19:06] <andrzejku> El_Che: but it is a little bit boring for me

[19:06] <El_Che> andrzejku: mostly AAI nowadays that involves architecture, programming and devops. I tend to use P5 and Go and try to use P6 where possible

[19:06] <andrzejku> ahh

[19:07] <El_Che> andrzejku: are you a perl dev?

[19:08] <andrzejku> El_Che: No, I am working with legacy system but in past I was writing some perl scripts at my job

[19:08] <andrzejku> C Developer

[19:08] <El_Che> C never gets old. A safe bet :)

[19:08] <andrzejku> El_Che: however we have a small script

[19:09] <andrzejku> it is written in Perl

[19:10] <andrzejku> El_Che: I don't know it maybe good but it is adding things into C kind of macros in every branching point if conditions functions etc. and there is a static array

[19:10] <El_Che> perl 5, I assume?

[19:10] *** go|dfish left
[19:10] <andrzejku> then when app is executed again we have code coverage raport which is also analyzed by Perl

[19:10] <andrzejku> yes

[19:10] <andrzejku> Perl 5

[19:10] <andrzejku> all team is complaining about that script

[19:11] <andrzejku> me either

[19:11] <El_Che> complaining?

[19:11] <andrzejku> yes

[19:11] <andrzejku> El_Che: it is not working perfectly and it looks too complicated

[19:11] <andrzejku> like on in one file

[19:12] <El_Che> I see, time to refactor ir :

[19:12] <El_Che> it :)

[19:13] <andrzejku> Well, that's right

[19:13] <El_Che> there are a few places still using my perl5 proof of concept code that was planned to be rewritten in Java. Intended for a few months, 13 years later it's still in production :)

[19:14] <andrzejku> someone actually wanted to use gcov there

[19:14] <andrzejku> but our project masters still want to develop on windows

[19:14] <andrzejku> so keep using Perl script :D

[19:15] <andrzejku> the funny thing is it was written by two Dr. guys

[19:15] <andrzejku> and it looks like a crap

[19:15] *** vrurg left
[19:16] <pyrimidine> speaking as someone who's maintained a huge perl5 repo with lots of code written by many Dr. guys, I can relate :)

[19:16] <pyrimidine> Not all crap, but there are definitely some crappy bits...

[19:16] <Xliff> lizmat: Thanks for looking.

[19:16] <El_Che> :)

[19:18] <lizmat> El_Che: some code of mine from 13 years ago is still making billions of dollars / year

[19:19] <El_Che> lizmat: I hope you got shares :)

[19:19] <pyrimidine> lizmat: some of the code I mention above, likewise (though probably more in the millions).  In lots of data workflows

[19:20] <El_Che> (and I really hope the company in question keeps using perl 5)

[19:20] <lizmat> El_Che: what do you think I've been living off / supporting Perl with the past 6.5 years ?

[19:20] <El_Che> lizmat: you married rich?

[19:20] <El_Che> :)

[19:20] <lizmat> El_Che: yeah, it was effortless

[19:20] <lizmat> not

[19:22] <andrzejku> do you think that refactoring Perl it means to rewrite Perl to Perl6?

[19:22] <El_Che> andrzejku: No. That would be porting in my view

[19:23] <andrzejku> ahh

[19:23] <El_Che> I am sure lizmat disagrees :P

[19:23] <andrzejku> it is still a little bit confusing that we have to learn Perl to get money and Perl6 to have fun

[19:24] <ufobat> ha!

[19:24] <Xliff> I wouldn't mind working in Perl5

[19:24] <Xliff> Would rather "work" in Perl 6, but the world is not perfect.

[19:24] <pyrimidine> Xliff: same here

[19:24] <lizmat> El_Che: I would not disagree with that

[19:24] <El_Che> lizmat: just teasing you, I know :)

[19:25] <b2gills> kybr: SetHash, BagHash, and MixHash are QuantHash's

[19:26] <SmokeMachine> I wouldn't mind working with perl5 or perl6. If it's not in Brazil... any one know any position? :)

[19:27] <Xliff> Are CStruct's 0-filled when they are created?

[19:27] <SmokeMachine> Id love to leave Brazil befor january first...

[19:27] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: booking.com seems to be always looking for Perl 5 devs. They are in amsterdam (dunno if it's a good place to work or not)

[19:28] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: if you think Brazil is too hot, then Amsterdam should be fine

[19:29] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I do... is there a job there for me?

[19:29] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: thanks!

[19:29] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: https://workingatbooking.com

[19:30] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: El_Che: thanks!

[19:31] <El_Che> (lizmat: for the record, the MLK meme is very unrespectful)

[19:31] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: good luck

[19:31] <El_Che> if you know p5 devs, maybe you know someone working there

[19:32] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: yes... there are some friends of mine working there...

[19:33] <El_Che> you get a foot on the door and they get a bonus :)

[19:37] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: with the promise of Pinochet-like economics as declared this week, I get that Amsterdam sounds interesting :)

[19:38] <SmokeMachine> someone told me that they are not getting the bonus anymore... looks that sameone had a script to send every resume on linkedin to them...

[20:03] <Xliff> It's not fixed, per se. It's more hacked.

[20:04] <Xliff> Or at least how I am using it.

[20:11] *** BooK_ left
[20:11] *** BooK_ joined
[20:12] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v BooK_

[20:12] <Woodi> just one thing: if current Perl 6 is neutralized or de-Perl'ed what will happen to Perl 5 ?  if it will be developed than it will probably gain modern features like nicer OO, functional programming, no side effects. also some improvements to regexes ? :)

[20:12] <lizmat> one can dream

[20:13] <Woodi> lizmat: but it will be cloning current Perl 6 :)

[20:13] <Woodi> on the other hand backward compatibility will be thrown away

[20:14] *** BooK_ left
[20:14] <lizmat> Woodi: well, that's one of the points I was trying to make earlier this year

[20:14] *** domidumont left
[20:14] <Xliff> Gist updated with wacky solution...

[20:15] <lizmat> I don't see any new features "planned" for Perl 5 that we haven't already implemented in Perl 6

[20:15] <El_Che> Woodi: whatever happens to Perl 6 will not have much effect feature-wise on Perl 5. The only think that may change is perception, as the next major version becomes available (and people don't mistakingly think perl 6 is a perl 5 upgrade)

[20:15] *** BooK_ joined
[20:15] <El_Che> s/think/thing/

[20:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v BooK_

[20:16] <lizmat> and *if* there would be features planned for Perl 5, there's a good chance they will be immediately also implemented in Perl 6 (if they make sense and are any good, of course)

[20:16] <El_Che> perl 5 has a very hard time implementing new features (because of backwards compability and the complexity and age of the code base)

[20:16] *** kerframil joined
[20:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kerframil

[20:17] <lizmat> so, while I value Perl 5 very much as a programming language, I think the runtime is past its prime

[20:17] <Woodi> Perl 5 have realy good backward compatibility. maybe make it even stronger by [re]stating that "if you write something in Perl 5 I will work forever" - instant enterprise goodie

[20:17] <lizmat> Woodi: as I discussed in https://www.perl.com/article/an-open-letter-to-the-perl-community/

[20:19] <Woodi> but main problem is that for some "Perl" means "Perl 5" and nothing new is allowed. means hibernation. it's unrealistic for few reasons

[20:19] <Woodi> lizmat: checking

[20:20] <El_Che> put on your asbestos cover

[20:22] <pmurias> lizmat: the language is tied to the runtime by all the XS modules

[20:22] <lizmat> pmurias: I'm not the only one pushing for PurePerl versions of modules

[20:22] <lizmat> mst is another person pushing that, for different reasons (fatpacking, afaik)

[20:23] <El_Che> and portability

[20:23] <mst> lizmat: and also "FML don't make me debug XS I'm bad enough at plain C"

[20:23] <pmurias> lizmat: other "scripting" languages have that problem too

[20:24] <Woodi> I don't think pure Perl 5 fans will allow so easily to die for Perl 5 codebase :)

[20:24] <El_Che> pmurias: pretty much everyone? C is also shunned in Go and Java if possible

[20:24] <pmurias> TruffleRuby is running Ruby C extensions on the JVM but it's a big effort founded by Oracle

[20:24] <El_Che> (as you introduce C security problems and make the code less portable and harder to build)

[20:25] *** Skarsnik joined
[20:25] <Woodi> C is king for many decades to come, eg. want to write in Ada and use that device ? ok, here, just compile that C drivers :)

[20:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Skarsnik

[20:26] <pmurias> El_Che: what do you mean by pretty much everyone?

[20:29] <pmurias> El_Che: is Java/Perl 6/Haskell there is a proper C FFI rather then just exposing random interpreter guts

[20:29] <El_Che> That C comes at a price and therefor is also avoided if possible

[20:30] <El_Che> specially in Go there is a strong tendency to avoid C bindings

[20:30] <pmurias> bindings are a different problem

[20:30] <El_Che> which is not a FFI problem, but a cultural practice

[20:30] <Skarsnik> FFI?

[20:31] <pmurias> foreign function interface

[20:31] <lizmat> El_Che: also, some of the latest round of MoarVM improvements were about replacing C-code by NQP alternatives that *could* be JITted

[20:31] <El_Che> indeed, I was impressed by that

[20:31] <lizmat> So hand-optimized C code is not always the best anymore

[20:32] <El_Che> Skarsnik: Foreign Function interface, iirc

[20:32] <Woodi> IMO speed always wins...

[20:32] <pmurias> lizmat: hand-optimized C code can also be JITted on the GraalVM ;)

[20:32] <Woodi> night

[20:36] <El_Che> Woodi: Java and Go have less a problem with speed that makes C a necessity (e.g. compared to Perl 5 or Python)

[20:44] <Skarsnik> what was the use of python in this then?

[20:48] <El_Che> that's painful glue

[20:54] <japhb> Skarsnik: What does that bot use to do the translation?

[20:55] <El_Che> oh, nativecallable6 bot, that's cool

[20:55] <Skarsnik> there is no npm command on debian? apt-file search bin/npm find me nothing

[20:55] <Skarsnik> or whatever the command to link modules xD

[20:56] <avuserow> !eco App::GPTrixie

[20:56] <avuserow> hmm I thought that was it

[20:57] <Kaiepi> Skarsnik, npm might be a separate package from node

[20:57] <Skarsnik> http://blogs.perl.org/users/sylvain_colinet/2016/03/rewriting-gumbo-binding---a-gptrixie-demo.html

[20:58] <japhb> Skarsnik: npm on Debian is less than ideal.  The fact that it is out of date at any given time is antithetical to the node+npm release cycle.  You may get (an old version of) it as part of the node or nodejs package, depending on your Debian variant.

[21:57] <Skarsnik> timotimo, I had the idea of writing a binary decompression with grammar and action, this look super overcrafted x)

[21:57] <timotimo> yeah, it'll be great for fun, maybe not entirely practical :) :)

[21:58] <ryn1x> either way... I guess I am trying to still wrap my head around what is different... in v6.c the inner await blocks the thread, but in v6.d it doesnt? 

[21:59] <timotimo> that's right, the scheduler takes a continuation and that gets shoved back into the thread pool

[21:59] <timotimo> on 6.c, a task (start block for example) is taken from the queue and one of the threads on the thread pool runs it, and the thread from the pool only gets usable again when that task is completely done

[22:00] <timotimo> in 6.d you have to set a custom $*AWAITER or $*SCHEDULER in order to ensure an await doesn't let your task jump across threads

[22:00] <ryn1x> ok. thanks!

[22:00] <timotimo> which is important when you're interfacing with C libraries that work with Thread Local Storage

[22:25] <patrickas> Hello, I am the jackass in question

[22:26] <patrickas> Andrew Shitov asked on irc how are people looking for raku going to find the perl6 info and I thought it was a valid concern and "solved it" in 30 minutes.

[22:27] <patrickas> I did not delete any perl or perl6 tags just added raku where possible... If people think it is wrong it can be easilly deleted...

[22:27] <patrickas> I can go back and delete it myself if it is causing distress

[22:27] <tony-o> it was done without discussion, which is the point ugexe was making about "Call to anyone who uses StackOverflow, discussion of adding [raku] as a synonym ..."

[22:30] <El_Che> it would be nice to know what's ugexe vision is and how an alias blocks it? Is the the Perl 6 as the Perl heir track? Something else?

[22:30] <patrickas> Sure if people want to discuss raku and maybe revert it that is fine.... but this has nothing to do with stackoverflow...

[22:31] <El_Che> patrickas: It does not look like it was done in bad faith. I would just wait a little to see how TimToady sees the alias thing.

[22:31] <tony-o> i can't speak to his vision but it does suck to be given "marketing reasons" as the reason that a language i've written a lot of modules for is changing names

[22:31] <El_Che> tony-o: alias, not chaning name

[22:32] <pmurias> El_Che: what's super annoying is trying to do a sneak rename under the guise of an alias

[22:32] <b2gills> patrickas: Just leave it, the mods can handle changing them back

[22:32] <lizmat> El_Che: I've come to the conclusion that what is happening here, is a thinly veiled attempt at a coup d'etat

[22:32] <tony-o> you can call it an alias all you want but that isn't exactly honest and it isn't exactly what's happening when you're jumping to add `raku` to everything within a day

[22:32] <patrickas> El_Che of course it was not done in bad faith. I have no doubt that Larry is not out to destroy perl6 :-)

[22:32] <El_Che> tony-o: I understand you don't like it. I just wonder about the vision ugexe was talking about. E.g. I know of lizmat's vision for Perl as a whole.

[22:33] <tony-o> lizmat++

[22:33] <b2gills> tony-o: I'm the one that posted the synonym thing

[22:33] <El_Che> lizmat: that an heavy hyperbole

[22:33] <n0tjack> What's the modern zef equivalent of " panda install Task::Star" now that panda is deprecated?

[22:34] <tony-o> zef install Task::Star

[22:34] <b2gills> ... synonym thing on meta.stackoverflow.com

[22:34] <El_Che> n0tjack: iirc Task::Star is dead

[22:34] <El_Che> (or wasn't?)

[22:34] <n0tjack> Hmm. How can I then install the Rakudo-default packages with zef?

[22:34] <tony-o> if it's not then zef install <module> is the panda equivalent to panda install <module>

[22:34] <n0tjack> I'm asking because I installed the latest Rakudo which claims to come with zef and p6doc but didn't, so I'm installing from scratch using rakudobrew

[22:35] <n0tjack> I just want a full Rakudo 2018.10 installation with zef and p6doc etc

[22:35] <pmurias> El_Che: the whole thing looking like that is a problem even if it's not the case

[22:35] <El_Che> n0tjack: here is the list stmuk using when building star: https://github.com/rakudo/star/tree/master/modules

[22:36] <tony-o> what part of that is hyperbole El_Che ?

[22:36] <n0tjack> kinda paintful

[22:36] <lizmat> Zoffix: yes

[22:36] <El_Che> tony-o: the coup d'etat

[22:36] <patrickas> lizmat a coup d'etat by the current dictator for life? that's not how coups d'etat work! :-/

[22:36] <patrickas> did Zoffix do it without blessing form Larry?

[22:37] <lizmat> I think it is quite unclear for which Larry gave his blessing

[22:37] <tony-o> El_Che i can't see why you think that is hyperbole

[22:37] <b2gills> patrickas: I posted a link to https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/376267/1337 which has more information

[22:37] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure that retagging questions on stackoverflow was not on his mind

[22:37] <b2gills> It has the transcript of Larry settling on Raku for instance

[22:38] <tony-o> if the alias thing was a good idea, it would have happened a few years ago when it was discussed ad nauseam 

[22:38] <lizmat> that's changing the history, the past

[22:38] <b2gills> lizmat: If they are marked as synonyms then if anyone in the future trys to mark something as [raku] it will get the [perl6] tag.

[22:38] <Zoffix> patrickas: no, I followed all the proper channels and collected two screensful of *links* to discussions for Larry to consider when making his final decision.

[22:38] <lizmat> the next step could very well be removing the perl6 tag from the questions on stackoverflow

[22:38] <tony-o> if i was battered with that question for 3 years i'd probably just say "fine here ya go" 

[22:38] <Zoffix> But for some reason I'm coup d'etating now

[22:38] <El_Che> tony-o: for a coup, I would expect the one or ones in power be ousted undemocratically. In this case, TimToady just picked an alias to unify existing aliases. Nothing more, nothing less. He's still there, and core devs weren't replaced by a new posse

[22:39] <patrickas> My question was mostly rhetorical.

[22:39] <patrickas> I think it is just an unfortunate coincidence that this is happening while larry is on vacation

[22:39] <Zoffix> lizmat: for the past 6 months I've been working on 6.d release and didn't have much time for coup d'etating 

[22:39] <b2gills> Also if the name Raku becomes the main name, the synonym feature could be reversed.

[22:39] <patrickas> But it is not like any irreversible happened

[22:39] <lizmat> I will not get into a discussion now: I will write a blog post tomorrow and explain my view

[22:39] <tony-o> El_Che that falls really well short of what actually happened.

[22:40] <tony-o> coup's never happen when someone leaves the capitol 

[22:40] <tony-o> b2gills: lmftfy *when* 

[22:40] * ryn1x is a little worried about all this drama and hopes nothing happens to his new favorite language

[22:41] <b2gills> ryn1x: This is not the first, or the most heated discussion. It will be fine.

[22:41] <El_Che> tony-o: that's what I saw. Probably I am missing a zillion of discussion within selected groups.

[22:41] <El_Che> b2gills: :) true

[22:42] <Zoffix> ryn1x: nothing bad will happen. In fact, this drama is based on imaginary boogeyman of Zoffix of Znet coup d'etating by... politely asking the BDFL to make a ruling.

[22:42] <El_Che> <drama>but will it be the last</drama>

[22:42] <b2gills> tony-o: I totally expect that it will become the main name at some point.

[22:42] <tony-o> politely asking for years

[22:42] <Zoffix> lizmat: yeah you got me! It was all a rouse! Next year I plan on writing even more code!

[22:42] <tony-o> and not taking `no` as the answer

[22:42] <Zoffix> tony-o: it was about 2 months of politely asking before the alias decision was birthed.

[22:43] <patrickas> I think hugging the trolls is not good enough policy. We should also hug the contributors form time to time.

[22:43] <n0tjack> As an outsider, I'm happy a stage name was selected and acted upon.

[22:43] <Zoffix> In fact, I wasn't even asking then, I was making the case to the community. The polite ask was a month ago.

[22:43] <tony-o> sure it was 

[22:43] <b2gills> It is something that is years in the making. I'm sure it predates Zoffix's involvement in the language.

[22:43] <lizmat> Zoffix: that question existed *at least* since TPCiA

[22:43] <Zoffix> lizmat: which question?

[22:43] <tony-o> the alias question.

[22:44] <Zoffix> lizmat: I wasn't there, so tony-o's characterization that I was harping on for years is crap

[22:44] <b2gills> .hug patrickas

[22:44] * huggable hugs patrickas

[22:44] <b2gills> patrickas: You mean like that ^

[22:46] <tony-o> looking forward to your post lizmat 

[22:46] <El_Che> Looking at some reactions, Zoffix could have had asked for a rename without much difference

[22:47] <Zoffix> Looking at some reactions, people are blowing an elephant out of a fly.

[22:47] <El_Che> Will I break someone's heart if I use "raku" as a name within my workplace?

[22:47] <El_Che> people that don't like will still use perl 6

[22:47] <El_Che> I don't see the drama here

[22:48] <Zoffix> lizmat: so will I have to get a new license plate for my coup d'etat?

[22:48] <El_Che> and no coup (a would expect more in the line of a succesful fork for that)

[22:48] <tony-o> not very graceful in victory are we zoffix?

[22:48] <El_Che> tony-o: is this a victory/defeat thing?

[22:50] <tony-o> it's obviously a polarizing topic and the marketeers for renaming perl6 are on the better end of the "discussion", don't act naïve 

[22:51] <El_Che> Oh, I would have prefered a renaming altogether. An alias is a compromise that for me doesn't solve the issues with Perl 5. I don't feel naive on that matter

[22:51] <b2gills> The only way the war will be won, is when the battles stop happening.

[22:51] <El_Che> For me, an alias is a good enough solution that allows everyone to win a little.

[22:52] <b2gills> There have been many battles over the Perl 6 name (often started by the Perl 5 camp, but sometimes from the Perl 6 camp).

[22:52] <Zoffix> tony-o: it was never a battle for me. As I've stated elsewhere, I worked in Marketing for over a decated and in the past 3 years have committed to the language 1,800 commits more than any other person. I have the best interests of the language in mind and I strive to achieve them. So far, in exchange for my efforts, a small group of people called me mentally unstable and accused me of coup d'etating. It's not

[22:52] <Zoffix> a you-win/I-win. We can all win, if we start presenting cogent arguments instead of calling each other names.

[22:54] <Juerd> This will go on forever, as it has for a decade and a half already. The grave potential consequences of either solution have been predicted, and it seems having an alias is making people from both sides unhappy and as such is not much of an end to it either.

[22:55] <b2gills> I see both being used over the years with Perl 6 slowly being overtaken by Raku

[22:58] <tony-o> then to dance on the feelings of someone who most obviously feels alienated by it is a pretty flagrant flaw in character

[22:58] <pmurias> b2gills: if the plan is to gradually make the alias more and more official it will cause aton of resentment

[22:58] <Kaiepi> honestly i don't understand why this caused such a rigt

[22:58] <Kaiepi> s/rigt/rift/

[22:58] <b2gills> pmurias: Who said anything about a plan?

[22:59] <dduncan> I've decided that I like the fully spelled out "Raku Perl 6" best as the name to go by, or the one I will use.  I think it is important to show the connection to Perl.  The main reason I support the Raku word is not about hiding a relation to Perl, but rather about making it easier to see at a glance that the language isn’t simply an enhanced version of the original Perl, that it has big differences.

[22:59] <b2gills> dduncan: Sounds good.

[23:00] <pmurias> b2gills: individual plans of people

[23:00] <El_Che> dduncan: if the audience if a Perl audience, sure. If not, ymmv.

[23:00] <tony-o> pmurias++

[23:00] <El_Che> s/if/is/

[23:01] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v yqt

[23:01] <El_Che> But the thing about an alias is that everyone can do as (s)he pleases.

[23:01] <b2gills> pmurias: I don't care about the plans of people. I only care about what the end result will be.

[23:01] <dduncan> Both Perl and non-Perl audiences would see that it is something different than the original Perl even if it draws heritage.

[23:01] <Juerd> dduncan: Keeping "Perl 6" in the name means you can just as well not have something in front of it. It will still look like a version number, make p5 people feel claustrophobic, and it will cause people to avoid (Raku) Perl 6 because it's called Perl and their friends said that Perl sucks.

[23:01] <El_Che> dduncan: many people stop listering after hearing Perl, sadly enough

[23:02] <El_Che> they mentally replace it with stereotypes

[23:02] <El_Che> (or cobol)

[23:02] <pmurias> El_Che: just like before the official alias

[23:02] <Juerd> But to be honest, I feel like I'm repeating things from 2004

[23:03] <El_Che> pmurias: it still be Perl. Everyone will see that after 5 minutes. My hope is that they would try it instead of dismissing off hand

[23:03] <Juerd> Some things have changed since 2004 though, which made me more accepting of the name Perl 6

[23:03] <tony-o> Juerd lol, because you are

[23:04] <El_Che> Juerd: like a release?

[23:04] <donaldh> I think if we focus on showing the world the amazing things you can do with Raku / Perl 6 then it doesn't really matter what it is called.

[23:04] <Juerd> Mostly, that "Perl 5 is dead" seems to have become more true than before :(

[23:04] <El_Che> donaldh: a killing app or a niche market would kill, yes. 

[23:04] <El_Che> donaldh: sadly, that's what all the small languages communities dream about.

[23:05] <dduncan> I totally agree that having the number in the name is poor, but I’m not so concerned to get rid of it now because it has been around for such a long time.

[23:05] <El_Che> Juerd: that's harsh!

[23:05] <Juerd> I'm surrounded by geeks, nerds, hackers, and the like, all day, every day. Internationally too. It's hard to "sell" Perl 6 because it's Perl, but unfortunately the best selling point seems to be that it's not like Perl 5.

[23:05] *** n0tjack joined
[23:05] <woolfy> Zoffix: I have been doing marketing for 30+ years and my company (companies) earned millions with it.  Sort of "pissing contest" against your decade of marketing.  I have spent a lot of money and time on marketing Perl, "pissing contest" against your loads of contributions to Perl 6.

[23:05] <dduncan> I also like “Raku” by itself, but we do have all these books coming out titled “Perl 6”.

[23:05] <Juerd> It makes me sad and I die inside when this is received with cheers, because I'm still very much in love with Perl 5 myself.

[23:05] <El_Che> Juerd: yes, that's my experience as well.

[23:05] <donaldh> I sell the features - Unicode, grammars, concurrency, etc.

[23:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v n0tjack

[23:06] <dduncan> I also love Perl 5 still and would not say it was dying off.  I don’t believe it and the community doesn’t need that antagonism.

[23:06] <El_Che> "I wrote this small piece of our CI infra in Rakudo" -> "ah cool, nice!"

[23:07] <El_Che> "I wrtoe this small piece of our CI infre in Perl 6" -> <rolling eyes>

[23:07] <El_Che> true story

[23:07] <tony-o> seems like hyperbole El_Che 

[23:07] <woolfy> If we are doing pissing contests, I will not win... because not a coder, just doing marketing.  Bad marketing, because I have lost.  But I do know that your proposal got a lot of negative remarks, from a lot of people, as in "we are very much against it", and you still did it, knowing that this day would come and people would be angry.

[23:07] <Juerd> woolfy: You've heard people debate in favour and against changing Perl 6's name for over a decade too. This risk of this happening has always been there...

[23:07] <El_Che> tony-o: happened last month

[23:07] <tony-o> sure did

[23:08] <El_Che> "Oh I don't mind doing that in Python or Ruby, but not in Perl, however I have never written Ruby or Perl"

[23:08] <El_Che> that's the kind of things I hear

[23:08] <woolfy> And now I am angry, and Liz is, and Andrew Shitov is, and dozens of other people are angry.

[23:08] <El_Che> stupid as hell

[23:08] <Juerd> Although the concept of an alias instead of a rename is relatively new, many are discussing this as if it is, or is eventually going to become, a name change.

[23:08] <El_Che> but nevertheless, it happens

[23:09] *** natrys left
[23:09] <patrickas> woolfy you are right it got negative remarks form people. But every single other solution including doing nothing and changing the name got a lot of negative remarks from lots of more people too. No?

[23:09] <dduncan> What does “stage name” actually mean though?  For many performers or authors, the stage name is the only thing audiences/readers know them as, so it is effectively a rename.

[23:09] <woolfy> And since you, Zoffix, walked away from the Facebook group Perl6, you don't see all the angry stuff there.  But it is.

[23:10] <lizmat> dduncan: let's assume we have a large group of people who dislike Germans

[23:10] <Juerd> woolfy: Note there's a huge selection bias in any Perl 6 community :)

[23:10] <woolfy> patricas: we did not need an alias.  We already got one.  A perfectly fine one: Rakudo Perl 6.  If you didn;'t want to use "perl 6", you could use "Rakudo", as demonstrated by Claudio Ramirez , and people would not roll their eyes.

[23:10] <lizmat> and you are an artists named Robert Zimmerman 

[23:10] <tony-o> patrickas: so we'll replace a lot of negative remarks with a lot of different negative remarks is your accepted solution?

[23:10] <lizmat> dduncan: and you use the stage name "Bob Dylan"

[23:11] <lizmat> you get successful because most people don't know that that's not his real name

[23:11] <dduncan> Yes, so that’s how a lot of hollywood stage names come about.

[23:11] <lizmat> suppose he would have called himself "Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman?

[23:11] <lizmat> would not have worked

[23:11] <Juerd> woolfy: When it comes to marketing, the Perl 6 community is not the target audience. They're already convinced Camelia is sweet and the language is awesome. :)

[23:11] <lizmat> that's why "Raku Perl 6" will never work

[23:12] <woolfy> So, when we have a community of less than a thousand people, and many of those are very much against a new alias, is it wise to push through and through and go on and on and on and make a new alias despite all those people who really really really do not want that alias?

[23:12] <lizmat> "raku" but itself in isolation could

[23:12] <woolfy> The result is anger.  Tatdaaa...

[23:12] <patrickas> my accepted solution is whatever Larry deems appropriate after having considered this debate for over a decade.  :-)

[23:12] <lizmat> *by

[23:12] <Juerd> lizmat: Agreed

[23:12] <lizmat> so what's happening now is that Larry said "ok, you can use Bob Dylan" as a stage name

[23:12] <patrickas> but I totally agree that the anger of core people in the community is legitimate and should be addressed 

[23:12] <Juerd> woolfy: There has been anger from many people, for a long time, already. It's just different people who are angry now, and lots of discussion (which I hope will increase the chances of a good outcome)

[23:12] <woolfy> Juerd: as you very well know, I have done a lot of marketing outside the echo chamber.  I have stood up against hundreds of people saying "Perl is dead".

[23:12] <tony-o> after being asked the same question for 10 years ^

[23:13] <lizmat> and now some people are spreading "Bob "Dylan" Zimmerman" everywhere

[23:13] <Juerd> woolfy: Yes, but mostly with the selection bias of people at least approaching a Perl branded thing.

[23:13] *** n0tjack left
[23:13] <tony-o> "we can't handle the people that are angry so we'll just upset different people and try to sort them out"

[23:13] *** n0tjack joined
[23:14] <lizmat> which is damaging for both the "Bob Dylan" stagename, and "Robert Zimmerman" the real name

[23:14] <lizmat> but more on that tomorrow... I will grab woolfy now for some Expanse

[23:14] <b2gills> dduncan: The exact details about Raku are probably going to stay in flux for years.

[23:14] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v n0tjack

[23:15] <tony-o> the language formerly known as perl6

[23:15] <woolfy> Juerd : well, it would hardly be useful if I would go to a zoo and try to convince people to stop looking at elephants and start using the butterfly language.

[23:16] <Juerd> woolfy: No, but instead of the zoo, I might suggest asking people at a huge congress like the CCC congress

[23:16] <woolfy> Liz tells me to back off.  To go to bed.  I am going to bed with the thought "we had a perfectly fine nickname alias extra-name whatever "Rakudo".  No need to make an official alias.  No need to add an official name that would piss people off.

[23:16] <patrickas> lizmat: if you are bothered about my adding the raku to stack overflow questions then as soon as people ( or just Larry) agree that it was a bad idea to use it as an alias I will go back and delete everything myself.

[23:16] <tony-o> she's probably right woolfy :-p

[23:17] <Juerd> The CCC, you know, where a room full of a few thousand (really) hackers cheered for a slide saying "STOP USING PERL"

[23:17] <Juerd> It seemed many were happy they could finally say this out loud.

[23:17] <tony-o> why wasn't that your yard stick for adding it to the questions in the first place patrickas ?

[23:17] <woolfy> Juerd : I am all in favor for that and I have been discussing that with some people, and they will meet me tomorrow and I will give them swag to bring to the next CCC and they will hand it out and talk about the wonders of Perl.

[23:17] <El_Che> woolfy: rakudo was my preferred name for an alias (als Zoffix's iirc). TimToady picked something else, so be it.

[23:17] <Juerd> I'll never forget this experience. I was there.

[23:17] <patrickas> lizmat: it was not done in bad faith. Just as a quick and dirty solution to Andrew's concern: How will people looking for Raku find answers on stack overflow

[23:18] <El_Che> Juerd: I saw the video. GRr

[23:18] <Juerd> woolfy: Many will avoid anything called Perl. Often for awful reasons. :(

[23:18] <patrickas> tony-o: my yard stick was whatever Larry says... as far as I understand it he said Raku is an alias. So I did not deleted perl6 tags I added raku as an alias

[23:18] <n0tjack> Do I now have to install zef separately from Rakudo?

[23:18] *** cygx joined
[23:18] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: the point that I disliked is that even though many people did not want to have an "official alias" at all, Zoffix proceeded and tried and tried and tried again and again to get it done.  And now got it.

[23:19] <tony-o> n0tjack: `rakudobrew build zef`

[23:19] <b2gills> patrickas: Don't change it yourself. If you want the tags removed just flag one of the posts and ask for a moderator to remove the tags

[23:19] <woolfy> And now eradicating the name "Perl 6" gradually.

[23:19] <El_Che> n0tjack: it's part of mu linux pkgs if you're using those

[23:19] <Juerd> El_Che: I was in the audience, both times. The first time I almost cried.

[23:19] <patrickas> b2gills: I don't mind doing the work... If only to show people that there is no bad faith at all.

[23:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cygx

[23:19] <cygx> patrickas: adding raku tags would mean you have to double-tag everything or fracture the community

[23:19] <n0tjack> tony-o: yeah, that's what I did, but it entails a lot of complexity, and my understanding from perl6.org was zef & p6doc came with Rakudo

[23:19] <cygx> that's just not a good idea

[23:19] <Juerd> El_Che: It was a perfect summary of what I had seen and heard many times already.

[23:19] <timotimo> n0tjack: i'm having trouble following everything on the channel right now, but what did you download?

[23:19] <cygx> an alias sounds good to me

[23:20] <n0tjack> I'm on a Mac. I downloaded the .dmg for MacOS.

[23:20] <dduncan> If the name Raku takes over, I hope that compensation will be made to those who have gone to the expense of making product such as books etc named “Perl 6” for losses they would take as a result, such as the expense of issuing re-branded editions or whatever else.

[23:20] <tony-o> n0tjack: there used to be a rakudo package you could install that did install the package manager, i haven't ever used it so i can't speak to it

[23:20] <Juerd> lizmat, woolfy: Good night, hope you won't lose too much sleep over this

[23:20] <woolfy> Juerd: I know.  I have seen the video.  I was at FOSDEM, where often, people would come up to the Perl-booth, and said stuff to my face as "perl is dead", Perl is dying", "Perl should be dead", "You should not be here", and sometimes even "please fuck off with your fucking Perl".

[23:20] <tony-o> but with rakudobrew you definitely need to install zef separately n0tjack 

[23:20] <b2gills> patrickas: The moderators have tools that do the work for them

[23:21] <n0tjack> tony-o: Yeah, I believe that was Task::Star, which is gone now. I guess I'll install rakudobrew, but to get that to work to even install zef, I have to ask it to build perl6/moar, and then I have two installs.

[23:21] <tony-o> n0tjack: you got a .dmg of rakudobrew ?

[23:21] <n0tjack> tony-o: No, the front-page "install Perl6 now [with Rakudo]" The .dmg is Rakudo.

[23:21] <woolfy> And that namecalling and dead-wishing happened too at OSCON and T-DOSE and NLUUG and FrosCON and other open source events where Liz and I promoted Perl.  And year after year, I stood up against those people, and year after year it got less.

[23:21] <n0tjack> But it doesn't come with zef, which I was under the impression it did, maybe mistaken

[23:22] <Juerd> dduncan: If the language ever takes off, the first books will become collector's items regardless of the name :)

[23:22] <b2gills> dduncan: Programming books tend to drop in sales very quickly

[23:22] <woolfy> And now I can brace myself for laughter that those idiots of Perl decided to rename Perl 6 to Raku.  We lost.

[23:22] <tony-o> n0tjack: i haven't used it but you can install zef using zef if you check it out from the repo

[23:22] <patrickas> cygx: it is only a temporary solution on the long run the tags can become synonyms so searching for one automatically finds the other. ( which is what I wanted to do in the first place but could not because perl6 contains a digit in the name ) 

[23:22] <woolfy> Bed.  Bye.

[23:22] <Juerd> woolfy: Ciao

[23:22] *** niceperl left
[23:22] <El_Che> woolfy: you missed Juerd's CCC testimonial

[23:22] <timotimo> n0tjack: the rakudo star download is supposed to come with zef. maybe it's just not in your path?

[23:23] <Juerd> El_Che: Even if she didn't see it here, we've discussed this in person several times. She knows.

[23:23] <n0tjack> timotimo: that's what I thought too, and no it's not on $PATH, but I can't find . -iname 'zef' in the perl6 directory either

[23:23] <timotimo> i wonder if it installs a zef-m instead

[23:23] <timotimo> contains*

[23:24] <b2gills> patrickas: The ability to ask for a synonym is newer than the synonym feature. Befor the ability to ask was added it all happened on meta.stackoverflow.com

[23:24] <timotimo> did i see correctly that what you want is a 2018.10, though?

[23:24] <tony-o> n0tjack: you can always try: git clone [email@hidden.address] cd zef; perl6 bin/zef install .

[23:24] <n0tjack> Well, that's the recommended version on perl6.org

[23:24] *** pecastro left
[23:24] <dduncan> To be clear, my “Raku Perl 6” preference was more of a short-term thing, so that people searching for or knowing about “Raku” or “Perl 6” will find it.  Later on I expect I would shorten it after things start to settle.

[23:25] <timotimo> i don't know how to unpack a .dmg to find out what's inside it

[23:25] <timotimo> oh, it's literally a "disk image"

[23:25] <timotimo> like, with a partition table and everything

[23:25] <n0tjack> timotimo: I'll figure it out. EIther I'll blow away the .dmg installed platform and install from source, or I'll find out where the .dmg stuffed away zef and stick it on my path

[23:26] <n0tjack> thanks everyone

[23:26] <dduncan> @timotimo yes, that’s one of the great things about the Mac disk image tech.

[23:26] <b2gills> No one knows what the future holds.

[23:26] <donaldh> n0tjack: I prefer to "brew install perl6"

[23:26] <n0tjack> I'm aiming to minimize complexity; rather focus on learning the language than a bunch of infra stuff.

[23:26] <tony-o> n0tjack: that command above will install zef from source (there are no depends so it can install itself) and it will tell you where the bin is

[23:27] <timotimo> i wonder how much the appimage people stole from dmg

[23:27] <n0tjack> tony-o++

[23:28] <donaldh> n0tjack: I've just installed from the .dmg to /Applications

[23:28] <n0tjack> Is zef on your path? I just found it in /Applications/Rakudo/share/perl6/site/bin

[23:28] <n0tjack> I'm gonna stick that on my $PATH

[23:28] <donaldh> n0tjack: the readme says export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Rakudo/bin:/Applications/Rakudo/share/perl6/site/bin and indeed zef is in /Applications/Rakudo/share/perl6/site/bin

[23:29] <n0tjack> argh, now I feel like a dunce

[23:29] <n0tjack> (well, I am, but I feel like one too)

[23:30] <donaldh> I did wonder if the .dmg installer did something more clever, but alas no.

[23:31] <donaldh> I guess that, in general, is why I prefer to use homebrew to install stuff on my mac, when a homebrew install is available.

[23:31] <El_Che> Angry people on facebook. A good reminder why I never bothered with it ;)
