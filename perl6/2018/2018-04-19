[10:10] <jkramer> How would I go about implementing this in Perl 6? open PAGER, "| $ENV{PAGER}"; say PAGER rand(10000) for(1..20)

[10:10] <jkramer> I tried it like this but it doesn't work the same way. https://paste.pound-python.org/raw/YjOdQHtJwUXHkj4GsOuT/

[10:11] <jkramer> That is, less should be run and display whatever I write to its pipe, then when quitting less the program should continue as normal.

[10:12] <jkramer> I also tried Proc with :in(True) and writing to $p.in, but it seems like that is blocking completely until the Proc finished, so I can't even write to its pipe after starting it, is that correct?

[10:14] <jkramer> Oh wait I think I got it

[10:33] <jnthn> brrt: <[0..9A..Fa..f]>

[10:33] <AlexDaniel> jkramer: please use `run` instead of `shell` at least

[10:34] <jnthn> jkramer: Are you sure it's not IO::Pipe.new's constructor that's getting unhappy?

[10:34] <AlexDaniel> not necessarily worse than being able to point it to any other executable, but still

[10:34] <jkramer> AlexDaniel: Yeah I know, for now I'm just trying to make it work somehow :)

[10:34] <jnthn> I'm pretty sure just creating an IO::Pipe instance directly won't do anything useful

[10:35] <jkramer> jnthn: That was just to reproduce the problem, the original code that causes this is: http://dpaste.com/37ZEW0P.txt

[10:37] <jkramer> Aaaaaah ok

[10:37] <brrt> thanks jnthn

[10:37] <jkramer> No wait. Well it should be $.close, not .close. But even with that fixed I'm getting the same error

[10:39] <jkramer> Apparently it has nothing to do with the .close call after all. -_-

[10:41] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: JJ self-assigned Rules for escaping characters in enumerated character classes could be clearer https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1146

[10:41] <brrt> I was kind-of sceptical of perl6 grammars; having actually used them in the last week or so, they are a wonderful feature

[10:41] <jkramer> m: class Oi { method DESTROY { say "destroyed" } }; my $x = 123; { temp $x = Oi.new; say $x }; say $x;

[10:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9e6ae276a: OUTPUT: ¬´Oi.new‚ê§123‚ê§¬ª

[10:42] <jkramer> Doesn't temp $x not get destroyed when it leaves the scope/gets reset to its earlier value?

[10:43] <timotimo> it does, but only when GC runs

[10:43] <Altreus> isn't that what happened? ;s

[10:43] <Altreus> oh, no "destroyed" I see

[10:44] <jkramer> Hmm, is there a different method I can use that gets run when leaving the objects scope?

[10:44] <timotimo> you can use a LEAVE phaser or a "will leave" trait

[10:45] *** jmerelo left
[10:50] *** MasterDuke left
[10:51] <jkramer> The LEAVE phaser has to be in the block, not in the object right?

[10:52] *** wamba left
[10:54] <jkramer> "will leave" seems to be run as soon as the variable originally leaves its original scope

[11:10] *** zakharyas left
[11:11] <timotimo> that's right

[11:12] <timotimo> we don't do reference counting - which would allow timely destruction - among other things because getting good performance in a multithreaded setting is extremely hard to do if you have to modify every object you touch every time you shuffle it around in memory

[11:20] <jkramer> Hmm so there's no way to automatically close the handle as soon as it leaves the scope?

[11:21] <timotimo> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Trait-IO

[11:21] <timotimo> see if this helps your use case

[11:22] <jkramer> That actually looks exactly like what I need :)

[11:23] <jkramer> Oh wait, probably not. I guess that also closes the handle in the scope where it was created?

[11:24] <timotimo> yes, just like a LEAVE phaser

[11:24] <timotimo> if you need a different scope, you can always declare the variable in another place from where you assign to it 

[11:24] <timotimo> not sure how auto-close deals with leaving the scope when you didn't assign to the variable yet, though

[11:24] <masak> there's only one way to find out! :D

[11:28] <jkramer> Well what I actually want to do is this: https://paste.pound-python.org/raw/9OijmFEqhFYtQU8D2yg7/

[11:29] <jkramer> But I guess it's not possible without having the user taking care of stuff themseves

[11:29] <jkramer> +l

[11:29] <timotimo> i would recommend having your user pass a closure to your pager sub

[11:29] *** Actualeyes left
[11:30] <timotimo> then you can also set $*OUT for them

[13:45] <timotimo> yeah, i haven't touched perl 5 yet

[13:45] <timotimo> from the "how to get from perl 5 to perl 6" documents i don't think i actually want to touch perl 5 any time soon :P

[13:46] <Juerd> I come from Perl 5, and still write Perl 5 for production purposes because Perl 6 doesn't fit my needs yet, but I'm patiently waiting until that happens :)

[13:46] <timotimo> i hope you'll be able to give us regular reports on what is holding you back

[13:46] <Juerd> Perl 5 and Python are on par, so if you know one and don't have to work with the other, it'd be a waste of time.

[13:48] <Juerd> Memory use and sheer performance, basically. In every single one of the projects where I get to choose the language, those are vital.

[13:48] <araraloren> And even better we can use Perl5 module in Perl6 :)

[13:50] <Juerd> timotimo: I've taken a completely passive approach to Perl 6 because I lack time and skills to improve things myself, but I keep running my own canary to see the progress :)

[13:50] <Juerd> Its been at 5.7 seconds for a long time though. It'll scoot ahead when someone starts working on regex performance :D

[13:51] *** mryan left
[13:51] <Juerd> The Perl 5 equivalent is at 0.3 seconds

[13:53] <timotimo> can you make public the regexes and test data you have?

[13:53] *** sharksoft joined
[13:54] <sharksoft> does anybody know if there's a P6 interface to the GSL laying around somewhere?

[13:57] <araraloren> I think we don't have one

[13:58] <araraloren> sharksoft, instead, I recommend you using Inline::Perl5

[13:58] <Juerd> timotimo: It is already. It's t/regex.t in https://github.com/Juerd/p6-mqtt

[13:58] <timotimo> ah, mqtt

[13:59] <Juerd> regex.t doesn't do any network stuff

[13:59] <timotimo> that's the one that takes 5.7 seconds?

[13:59] <Juerd> Yep

[14:00] <Juerd> The function that converts an mqtt pattern into a regex can probably be made faster by doing that in a different way, but I'd consider using nqp or ugly index/substr scanning a form of cheating because I'd never bother with that in other code either

[14:00] <Juerd> https://github.com/Juerd/p6-mqtt/blob/master/lib/MQTT/Client.pm#L15-L38  # definitely not the fastest implementation :)

[14:09] <timotimo> have you tried EVAL instead of /<$regex>/?

[14:13] *** FROGGS joined
[14:13] <timotimo> that seems slower somehow

[14:14] <timotimo> ah, my moar was unoptimized

[14:16] <timotimo> 4.9s instead of 5.6s; not as much as i had hoped

[14:22] <timotimo> the profiler is extraordinarily unhappy with this code :|

[15:48] <gtodd>  is big-oh notation uhh something developers do all the time - like in heir sleep?

[15:50] <moritz> I do a rough Big-o estimtion of code as I'm writing it

[15:50] <moritz> *estimation

[15:50] <gtodd> I mean I get the idea of "decomposing" an algorithm into some kind of simpler notation for assessing its efficiency but it sometimes seems like something computer science degrees like to do  for other reasons 

[15:51] <gtodd> sort of like lawyers tossing out a bit of Latin :-D

[15:52] <moritz> when I'm writing nested loops, I ask myself how big the input lists are, and like, for two nested loops, if they are likely to be larger than 100 or so, I might start to worry

[15:52] <moritz> when the levels are thre, I worry earlier

[15:52] <gtodd> moritz: ok ... so I just think of it as a way of imagining/estimating different algorithmic approaches to some problem ... I mostly get it wrong but things work out anyway :)

[16:08] <ufobat_> Herby_, you mean how to install the module should be part of the POD / README.md ?

[16:08] <lizmat> ufobat_: I created a PR  :-)

[16:09] <ufobat_> lizmat, that was manwars job ;-p but thank you!

[16:10] <ufobat_> Herby_, i dont know, most modules dont contain information about the installation, i think. what do you think about that jmerelo 

[16:11] <Herby_> ufobat_: i was just thinking a simple:  zef install I18N::LangTags

[16:11] <Herby_> a lot of the older modules still have installation instructions using pandas

[17:28] <Herby_> jmerelo: the context was regarding feedback to put a "how to install this module" blurb in his README.md

[17:29] <Herby_> something along the lines of: zef install <module-name>

[17:29] <Herby_> I suggested that because there are some older p6 modules floating about with installation instructions for pandas, and I figured it would avoid confusion for newcomers

[17:36] <Herby_> My first p6 module is just about ready to upload and be added to the ecosystem

[17:37] <Herby_> is there a good set of instructions aimed at beginners to accomplish this?

[17:37] <Herby_> a google search sends me to this page, which basically states this method will be deprecated: https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Upload_your_Module_to_p6c

[17:49] <jmerelo> Herby_: no, it's not going to be deprecated. That should have been fixed. It's basically doing a PR to add your module to the list. It undergoes some checks, we accept the PR, and that's it.

[17:49] <jmerelo> Just give it a go, I'll give you a hand in the PR review if needed.

[18:05] <ufobat_> jmerelo, do you considder linking to https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Looking_for_and_installing_modules. better then adding a small "do a zef install my::Module" to the readme.md of a module?

[18:05] * ufobat_ is having a sushi overdose :D

[18:05] <jmerelo> ufobat_: no, of course not. But there was no such thing on the modules doc, so I just added it.

[19:27] <comborico1611> For some reason I didn't get an error in my REPL.  Some typo or something I don't understand.

[19:34] <geekosaur> you are trying to assign three things to one variable. two of them go nowhere

[19:34] <geekosaur> my <listthing> = <listthing>

[19:35] <timotimo> the repl prints the result of the whole statement; your statement parenthesizes to be equivalent to (my $dashes = "+"), "- " x 4, "+"

[19:35] <timotimo> so when the repl prints it, you get the content of dashes, followed by four dashes and finally a +

[19:35] <comborico1611> timotimo: I see!

[19:36] <comborico1611> So would parens be the solution to wrap them all under $dashes?

[20:49] <Zoffix> phdphil: filed that one as R#1750  It's just doing log_e(1000)/log_e(10) and probably can be improved, as I don't see that precision noise in C/Perl 5.

[20:49] <synopsebot> R#1750 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1750 [math] &log10(x) is just a log_e(x)/log_e(10)

[20:50] <Zoffix> phdphil: if you spot any more such things, just file a new Issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/new  I don't think this channel is monitored by devs 24/7, so some of the stuff you find might get missed.

[20:50] *** mcmillhj left
[20:53] <Zoffix> Oh, I filed the log10. I guess log(1000, 10) is meant to produce that answer :P

[20:54] <Zoffix> yeah

[21:07] <pmurias> unclechu: I'm working on the js backend, it passes a lot of tests on node.js but it's not really usable for running inside the browser just yet

[21:08] *** patrickz left
[21:08] <pmurias> unclechu: I plan on switching to making it usable for playing around with very soon (that includes a tutorial)
