[00:55] <Kaiepi> this isn't so much a perl question, but just a general programming question

[00:56] <Kaiepi> i have a native struct class that has some ucs4 string members https://hastebin.com/zoxebisalu.rb

[00:56] <Kaiepi> would it be a good idea to have start and end methods in it to convert them to utf8 strings to make it easier to view them?

[00:57] *** comborico1611 left
[00:57] <timotimo> hm, if we had ucs4 support in core, you could just define those as Str with "is encoded"

[00:57] <Kaiepi> yeah, problem is there isn't

[00:57] <Kaiepi> afaik

[00:57] <timotimo> in theory you can write your own; i'm not sure if nativecall would actually use that properly yet

[00:59] <Kaiepi> the library i'm writing this for has stringprep_ucs4_to_utf8, which can do it for me

[03:36] <Zoffix> So, for rakudo.org, 99% of posts are release announcements. I'm going as far back as 2015/11/28, up to and including "Announce: Rakudo Star Release 2015.11 (now in beta!)" and copying the stuff to new stuff. For earlier release announcements, I'll add rewrites to point to release notes on github. Everything else (there are a couple of ancient posts) I'm leaving behind.

[04:00] <Kaiepi> i love how easy it is to write c/c++ wrappers and how you can give methods and properties the same name so i can do stuff like this https://hastebin.com/pasokoxiji.rb

[04:01] <Kaiepi> doing this in node this would require several different files and be complex as hell

[04:02] <Kaiepi> and would require a Makefile and compiling on npm install

[04:02] <Kaiepi> i don't have to do any of that in perl

[04:40] <Kaiepi> thanks

[12:43] <rashadulxslam> hi, can someone please help me with example and link "how to create a pidgin plugin which will take unix command as input and sendIM as output to the user"

[12:48] *** trnh joined
[12:51] <moritz> rashadulxslam: is this some kind of homework assignment?

[12:55] <rashadulxslam> moritz: yes

[12:56] <El_Che> rashadulxslam: have a look at libpurple

[12:56] <rashadulxslam> El_Che: already working on libpurple but hard to get such example

[12:59] <El_Che> that's why homework is fun

[12:59] <El_Che> Work from there: https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Scripting%20and%20Plugins

[12:59] <El_Che> and have a look at the source of simple plugins here: https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins

[13:00] *** trnh left
[13:04] <rashadulxslam> El_Che: yes already working on those plugins - need some simple example :)

[13:04] <rashadulxslam> which i mentioned in my question

[13:07] <moritz> nobody is going to do your homework for you

[15:45] <cfa> considering creating a new p6doc page named 'Module Packages' and linking there from Packages, Modules

[15:45] <cfa> any objections, suggestions for better placement?

[16:32] <dylanwh> mst: I know the alternative for Taint::Util but I need that path to be very fast. :)

[16:33] <mst> my general solution to that sort of problem is to introduce a validation barrier and defenestrate taint mode

[16:33] <mst> I'm aware that's probably not a practical option for you, mind

[16:39] <dylanwh> I'm keen to reove it, but that will wait 'til after I have a usable 6.0 release

[19:11] <Pilu> I want to push a repository using git

[19:11] <Pilu> it asks me for username and password

[19:12] <El_Che> Pilu: use ssh or have a look at git config

[19:13] <Pilu> so it can't be done with perl?

[19:13] *** Ven`` joined
[19:14] <El_Che> shure it can, but it's a reinventing the wheel kind of thing

[19:15] <El_Che> what sometimes do in code is create GIT_ASKPASS programmatically and go from there

[19:15] <El_Che> https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials

[19:15] <El_Che> (on repos that don't use ssh keys)

[19:15] <Pilu> I am curious how to do this in perl

[19:16] <Pilu> can you tell me what to read

[19:16] <Pilu> or what to search on google?

[19:16] <El_Che> have a look at the link I pasted. A simple algorythm would be:

[19:17] <El_Che> create a file (script) that outputs the password, like "echo -n password"

[19:17] <El_Che> set the env variable GIT_ASKPASS that points to that file

[19:17] <El_Che> that's it

[20:19] <dylanwh> XS is vital for bugzilla.mozilla.org. 

[20:19] *** Kaiepi joined
[20:19] <dylanwh> before I started using untaint() from Taint::Util, we had 6 million calls to the regexp /^(.*)$/

[20:20] <El_Che> wow

[20:20] <dylanwh> also Cache::Memcached is worse than using no memcached.

[20:20] <mspo> those all sound like bugs :)

[20:20] <moritz> can you please keep the bugzilla discussion out of #perl6?

[20:20] <dylanwh> Sorry. :)

[20:22] *** FROGGS joined
[20:26] *** zakharyas left
[20:33] <timotimo> surely /^(.*)$/ is optimized out the wazzoo in perl5?

[20:36] <dylanwh> it's not faster than just unsetting the taint bit

[20:36] *** espadrine joined
[20:36] <dylanwh> but I won't speak further here. I have my own irc channel. :)

[20:36] <timotimo> right, but it could compile down to just an assignment to $/ and the untaint?

[20:38] *** zakharyas joined
[20:38] <mst> I think the regexp questions can go to #perl

[20:39] <mst> and there's a #bugzilla on irc.mozilla.org for bugz stuff
