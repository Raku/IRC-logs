[00:00] <timotimo> oh, right

[00:00] <timotimo> that happens when it doesn't return

[00:00] <timotimo> i mean when the "if" condition doesn't trigger

[00:00] <timotimo> you could have an else { %( ) } for example

[00:00] <timotimo> needs the space in between, for reasons

[00:02] <Herby_> gotcha, that fixed the error

[13:44] <uzl> good morning!

[13:44] <uzl> m: my %nums = %(flat 'a'..'b' Z 1..2); for %nums.values -> $v is rw { $v += 10 }; say %nums;

[13:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «{a => 11, b => 12}␤»

[13:44] <uzl> m: my %nums = %(flat 'a'..'b' Z 1..2); for %nums.values <-> $v { $v += 10 }; say %nums;

[13:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «{a => 11, b => 12}␤»

[13:47] <uzl> '-> $v is rw' and '<-> $v'  achieves the same thing in this example. Are they truly equivalent? Can they be used interchangeably?

[13:50] <timotimo> m: say (-> $a is rw { }).perl; say (<-> $a { }).perl

[13:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «-> $a is rw { #`(Block|55888984) ... }␤-> $a is rw { #`(Block|56150400) ... }␤»

[13:51] <uzl> So both of them are just Blocks?

[13:51] <timotimo> well, yeah, but the important bit is the signature i thought?

[13:53] <uzl> I was curious because '<->' wasn't mentioned in https://docs.perl6.org/language/hashmap#In_place_editing_of_values and they seem to achieve the same thing.

[13:54] <lichtkind> why does $m.gist() does fall back to $m.perl even there is a gist method (with 2 optional parameter?)

[14:01] <moritz> lichtkind: sounds like there's an error in there somewhere; can you provide a minimal example to reproduce that?

[14:01] <moritz> m: class A { method perl { 'perl' }; method gist($a?, $b?) { 'gist' }}; A.new.gist()

[14:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: ( no output )

[14:01] <moritz> m: class A { method perl { 'perl' }; method gist($a?, $b?) { 'gist' }}; say A.new.gist()

[14:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «gist␤»

[14:01] <moritz> seems to work

[14:04] *** stmuk_ left
[14:16] <lichtkind> moritz, yes i had a typo in it, however looks I also found a bug, because when i opt type contrains it work:       multi method gist(Math::Matrix:D: Int:D :$max-chars?, Int:D :$max-rows? --> Str) {

[14:17] <lichtkind> moritz, i meant when i leave out the Int:D

[14:18] <timotimo> that's because :D constraints and optional parameters don't mix well

[14:18] <timotimo> when you don't give it a max-rows, for example, it'll be the default value, which is Int, which doesn't pass the type check against Int:D

[14:26] *** curan left
[14:28] <lichtkind> timotimo, good point thanks but when i give them defaul values then i cant know if I got any params

[14:29] <timotimo> there's a way, but you might not like it

[14:30] <moritz> lichtkind: you could give default values that don't make much sense otherwise, like -42

[14:31] <lichtkind> timotimo, i afraid so and yes moritz true but I still dont like it 

[14:32] <lichtkind> i think i rather drop the :D

[14:32] <timotimo> what you can do is this:

[14:33] <timotimo> m: class Foo { role SentinelRole { }; constant $sentinel = 42 but SentinelRole; method gimme-an-arg-maybe(Int:D :$foo = $sentinel) { if $foo =:= $sentinel { say "no arg given" } else { say "arg given" } }; Foo.new.gimme-an-arg-maybe();

[14:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3iven" } }; Foo.new.gimme-an-arg-maybe();7⏏5<EOL>␤»

[14:33] <timotimo> m: class Foo { role SentinelRole { }; constant $sentinel = 42 but SentinelRole; method gimme-an-arg-maybe(Int:D :$foo = $sentinel) { if $foo =:= $sentinel { say "no arg given" } else { say "arg given" } } }; Foo.new.gimme-an-arg-maybe();

[14:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «no arg given␤»

[14:33] <timotimo> m: class Foo { role SentinelRole { }; constant $sentinel = 42 but SentinelRole; method gimme-an-arg-maybe(Int:D :$foo = $sentinel) { if $foo =:= $sentinel { say "no arg given" } else { say "arg given" } } }; Foo.new.gimme-an-arg-maybe(42);

[14:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 2␤  in method gimme-an-arg-maybe at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:34] <timotimo> m: class Foo { role SentinelRole { }; constant $sentinel = 42 but SentinelRole; method gimme-an-arg-maybe(Int:D :$foo = $sentinel) { if $foo =:= $sentinel { say "no arg given" } else { say "arg given" } } }; Foo.new.gimme-an-arg-maybe(foo => 42);

[14:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar e436f4e53: OUTPUT: «arg given␤»

[14:34] <timotimo> that's "a default value that doesn't make much sense", and also not easily reachable for your users

[14:44] <lichtkind> timotimo, i appreciate your effort greatly but to me its cleaner just ignore the case where people just give me niesensical type object, but my current solution is not clean either because definedness is irrelevant but rather if calue is in certain range since there are also nonesensical ints i have to reject that would make the output of gist idiotic

[23:48] <tyil> how come sprintf doesn't like this?

[23:48] <timotimo> m: (0.5).fmt("%.6f").say

[23:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9b297074f: OUTPUT: «0.500000␤»

[23:48] <tyil> oh

[23:48] <tyil> thanks timotimo 

[23:48] <timotimo> m: ("%.6f").fmt(0.6).say

[23:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9b297074f: OUTPUT: «Your printf-style directives specify 0 arguments, but 1 argument was supplied␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:48] <tyil> oh

[23:48] <timotimo> oh, not like that either?

[23:49] <timotimo> hah

[23:49] <tyil> interesting

[23:49] <timotimo> m: ("%.6f").sprintf(0.6).say

[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9b297074f: OUTPUT: «0.600000␤»

[23:49] <timotimo> sorry i forgot to switch sprintf in for that second one

[23:51] <timotimo> i think this is a job for ... putting my body onto something rectangular and soft, and not move much for multiple hours
