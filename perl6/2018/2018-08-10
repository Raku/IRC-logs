[01:19] <Elronnd> is it possible to improve perl6 startup time?  Maybe it can be compiled to native code?

[01:21] *** Khisanth joined
[01:21] <lookatme_q> yeah, I think one day it can

[01:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Khisanth

[01:22] <benjikun> Elronnd: It's an ongoing WIP

[01:22] <timotimo> compiling perl6 code to native code isn't worth a lot, since it's so dynamic. you really need run-time stats and such to know what's worth what

[01:23] <timotimo> i mean pre-compiling perl6 the compiler and such to native assembly code ahead of time

[01:23] <timotimo> we already do just-in-time compilation to x86_64 assembly

[01:23] <timotimo> but that's famously not helpful for startup :)

[01:23] <benjikun> is there an issue open for ongoing additions to improvements in startup time on rakudo/rakudo?

[01:24] <timotimo> not sure if we create tickets for such broad topics

[01:24] <timotimo> anyway, Elronnd, the more of your code is in modules, the faster your program will start up

[01:25] <Elronnd> I just mean a literal hello world -- it takes a noticeable amount of time to startup

[01:25] <Elronnd> I had planned to port some of my shell utilities to perl6 to learn it -- those run almost instantly

[01:25] <timotimo> yeah, 0.11 seconds for me

[01:25] <benjikun> timotimo: There is one open on MoarVM for contributing to the task of creating executables in the future

[01:26] <benjikun> seems equally broad

[01:26] <timotimo> wasn't that just created yesterday?

[01:26] <benjikun> not sure, just saw Zoffix link it

[01:27] <timotimo> i don't mean to gatekeep or anything, just not sure if the ticket would be of much use?

[01:27] <Elronnd> has anyone experimented with compiling to the jvm and then compiling that to native?

[01:27] <benjikun> yeah idk

[01:27] <benjikun> a discussion could help contributing to the idea is what I thought

[01:28] <timotimo> hmm

[01:28] <benjikun> Elronnd: there were hacky ways to do it a long time ago, but not that I know of as of recently

[01:28] <benjikun> even then, it depended on stuff being installed still

[01:28] <geekosaur> jvm rakudo's never been functional enough to be worth trying

[01:28] <timotimo> it was quite functional at a few points in the past

[01:28] <timotimo> those were before the 1.0 release, though, i believe

[01:28] <benjikun> :/

[01:29] <timotimo> are there compile-to-native-code jvm things that support invokedynamic?

[01:29] <geekosaur> iirc it never recovered from the GLR

[01:29] <MasterDuke> truffle supports it

[01:30] <MasterDuke> but that's just part of nqp so far

[01:30] <timotimo> OK, cool. people are working on a truffle backend

[01:32] <Zoffix> timotimo: no, the Issue has been there for 2 months. As for gatekeeping... Well, it's easier to link to an Issue that explains everything instead of writing a paragraph each time someone asks about it

[01:32] <Zoffix> And last time it was asked about was literally yesterday.

[01:32] <benjikun> Yeah lol

[02:51] <SmokeMachine> I have a module named Red, that uses an module called Red::Traits that exports some trait_mod:<is> subs... how can I make Red export those too?

[02:52] <geekosaur> painfully >.>

[02:52] <SmokeMachine> benjikun: :)

[02:52] <geekosaur> there' a lot of export machinery that's only conjectured at present; you get to create aliases in Red::EXPORTS to things in Red::Traits::EXPORTS, iirc

[02:53] <benjikun> oof

[02:53] <geekosaur> (those are packages)

[03:02] <SmokeMachine> geekosaur: like that? its not working... https://glot.io/snippets/f3pm6viiz0

[03:03] <geekosaur> no, not like that. somewhere in the docs is an explanation of how the EXPORT packages work; you will have to switch to the package and create entries

[03:05] <geekosaur> https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#UNIT::EXPORT::*

[03:05] <geekosaur> you will need to mess with the packages directly; there is no machinery to do it for you

[09:19] <timotimo> the perl6 repl doesn't have a "help" function, AFAIK

[09:20] <perl6nopath> sorry, but have it still open what can i check else ?

[09:20] <timotimo> well, the simplest thing is of course just:   say "hello world"

[09:22] <timotimo> i do most of my perl6 development in vim, specifically gvim

[09:22] <perl6nopath> ok seems to work: > say "it works"; it works >

[09:22] <timotimo> that's a good start

[09:23] <perl6nopath> but how to integrate in IDE or editor . don't want to past alwasy may file content ?

[09:23] <timotimo> of course

[09:24] <timotimo> first step is usually to make sure perl6 is in the system's PATH

[09:24] <timotimo> i.e. if you just open a cmd.exe and type "perl6", does it already give you the REPL?

[09:24] <stmuk> the MSI installation should set the windows PATH

[09:24] <timotimo> oh, nice

[09:25] <timotimo> then, all you need to do is make your editor or ide call perl6 with the filename you're editing, or whatever script file it is you want to run

[09:25] <timotimo> vim, for example, should allow something like :!perl6 %

[09:25] <pmurias> would it make sense to have the windows MSI install linenoise?

[09:25] <timotimo> pmurias: it does already

[09:26] <timotimo> if you have a "lib/" folder with module stuff in it, you will also have to put a -I lib in front of the %

[09:26] <stmuk> the problem was linenoise stopped working due to a new rakudo bug (now fixed)

[09:26] <perl6nopath> no the PATH seems unchanged after installation:Path=C:\Oracle\11_64;C:\Oracle\11_64\bin;C:\Oracle\11_32;C:\Oracle\11_32\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\ OWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Enterprise Vault\EVClient\;C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin;C:\Dwimperl\per n;C:\Dwimperl\perl\site\bin;C:\Dwimperl\c\bin; ;C:\Program Files (x86)\d.velop\d3client

[09:27] <perl6nopath> no path to C:\rakudo\......

[09:27] <stmuk> even if you open a new cmd.exe  after the MSI installation?

[09:28] <timotimo> i mean, if you're setting up a command for your vim, like for example ":rp6" or so, you can set it up to use the full path, then you don't have to add it to PATH

[09:28] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v w_richard_w

[09:29] <stmuk> perl6nopath: I think it asks you if you want to add to PATH in the installer so you may have clicked "No"

[09:31] <perl6nopath> any idea for PADRE, i started installing V6 pacvkage, but that does not need got answer: Line 1: use V6; Syntax Check: Line 1:() Perl V6.0.0 required-- this is only  v5.14.2, stopped  

[09:32] <Lasse_> Thanks timotimo, you answered someone else but -I lib was the remedy for my problem too:) 

[09:33] <timotimo> cool, glad to help

[09:37] <perl6nopath> i am reinstalling to check, there is an checkbox which i have not unchecked, and there are two lines what pathes have to or will be added (C:\rakudo\...)

[09:40] <stmuk> yes the shorter PATH points to perl6 and the longer to the zef install directory

[09:42] <perl6nopath> no the PATH is not changed, despite the checkbox, but i can do it manually.

[09:44] <stmuk> even if you login and logout again?

[09:44] <stmuk> I thought a new cmd.exe session picked up the new PATH but I'm not sure and don't use Windows much

[09:45] <stmuk> logout/login I mean

[12:22] <masak> perl6nopath: though I guess you already installed Rakudo, so it's a little odd that there isn't

[14:10] <xelak> If I have something like '$*OUT=open("/tmp/foo.out", :w"); run("ls");', should the output of 'ls' be redirected to the file?

[14:12] *** simpleauthority1 joined
[14:13] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v simpleauthority1

[14:14] <timotimo> correct, run does not use $*OUT by itself

[14:14] <timotimo> in fact, if you don't pass anything for :out, it won't do any capturing at all

[14:14] <timotimo> it will just inherit the stdio file descriptors

[14:18] *** simpleauthority1 left
[14:21] <xelak> Is this behavior intentional? When I do something similar in perl -e 'open(STDOUT, ">/tmp/foo.out"); system("ls");' the output will be redirected.

[14:26] *** pmurias left
[14:27] <timotimo> i have no opinion on that

[14:28] <Zoffix> xelak: it's not exactly equivalent in that $*OUT isn't a global variable. It's dynamic and could have many threads, each writing to it's own $*OUT set to different handles. But there's just one STDOUT. By default run makes the process inherit the actual STDOUT.

[14:29] <Zoffix> xelak: you can give it $*OUT to write to: $*OUT=open("/tmp/foo.out", :w); run("ls", :out($*OUT));

[14:29] <Zoffix> xelak: and I think the difference lies in that in Perl 6 you can't just rebind the actual STDOUT from within the program like you did in that Perl program.

[14:29] *** sena_kun left
[14:29] <Zoffix> (unless NativeCall maybe?)

[14:33] <xelak> Zoffix: I'm currently working on a fix for R#1882, and my question was more about that. My current solution uses a somehow a write to $*OUT in a certain case ...

[14:33] <synopsebot> R#1882 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1882 [easy to resolve][good first issue] run(..., :$out, :merge) does not redirect stderr to the $out file handle

[14:34] <xelak> elsif nqp::istype($out, Str) && $out eq '-' {             @!pre-spawn.push({                 $!proc.Supply(:bin).act: -> $buf { $*OUT.write($buf); };             }) if $merge;         }

[14:36] <xelak> Zoffix: So how can I do a write to stdout then?

[14:37] <Zoffix> xelak: isn't the bug that STDERR doesn't get written to the given IO::Handle?

[14:40] <Zoffix> So this conditional sets $!out to a merged pipe: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Proc.pm6#L51-L61

[14:40] <Zoffix> But it should check if $out is set to an IO::Handle, and if it is, then do `@!pre-spawn.push({ $!proc.bind-stdout: $out; $!proc.bind-stderr: $out });` and not do the rest of the things

[14:41] <Zoffix> At least in theory. I'm not familiar with proc guts

[14:43] <Zoffix> Like this I mean: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/782784e1ae1cce95fd8e506377b08952

[15:28] <xinming> tobs: Thanks, that's what I want.

[15:29] <xinming> what is the difference between nextsame and callsame?

[15:29] <xinming> I'I think callsame will come back.

[15:30] <tobs> as timotimo said, nextsame is like "goto". It jumps to next callee and never returns.

[15:30] <tobs> exactly

[15:30] <xinming> and nextsame will go

[15:30] <xinming> Thanks.

[16:49] <lizmat> yeah, you won't find Perl 6 modules on MetaCPAN  :-(

[16:54] <Altreus> in order to have sensible type constraints that don't risk resulting in a circular dependency it seems the right way to do that is use a role for the type, and then independently implement that role in a real class somewhere, and then only use the class when needed. But this means I either have role The::Type::Role and class The::Type, or role The::Type and class The::Type::Class

[16:54] <Altreus> this seems wonky

[16:54] <Altreus> anyone got any good advice on naming these things?

[17:04] <moritz> Altreus: typically, role names are more abstract than class names

[17:05] <moritz> for example, a class maybe a Tree, but the type constraint you need for a depth-first traversal is Traversable, no Tree or Treeish

[17:05] <timotimo> Treeable

[17:05] *** Tools27 joined
[17:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Tools27

[17:06] <moritz> and it typically makes sense to ask yourself "what role do I care about for this particular method?" rather than defaulting to the class itself as a type constraint

[17:14] <xinming> Ok, never thought  ,  can be an operator.

[17:14] <Xliff> OK. I can still not get a list of candidates from a method.

[17:16] <geekosaur> doesn't there need to be a & in there so you're speaking of the method and not its result?

[17:16] <Xliff> Lemme check.

[17:17] <geekosaur> although I think methods aren't currently convenient that way, may need to do something like .^find_method

[17:17] <Zoffix> Xliff: look back at moritz's code. His had ".^lookup..." bit in it

[17:19] <El_Che> it will regenerate the sha1 dir

[17:19] <Zoffix> xinming: yeah, there might be more warts currently being ironed out on new work (R#2196) You need to use a tested release if you want stability.

[17:19] <Xliff> No matter what I want to do, the first method in the list is checked.

[17:19] <xinming> I'm using newest rakudo. :-)

[17:20] <Xliff> Do I need to move that method further down the class method order to get the other two to be checked, first?

[17:20] <Zoffix> xinming: newest is 2018.06 :)

[17:20] <geekosaur> Xliff, I think currently iorder matters, for speed, you want the ore specific ones first

[17:20] <Zoffix> Xliff: they take entirely different arguments tho. The first one takes no positionals, but later two do.

[17:20] <xinming> the masterbranch

[17:20] <xinming> will wait for 2018.07 released

[17:20] <xinming> downgrading now.

[17:20] <Zoffix> xinming: 2018.08. The .07 was skipped

[17:21] <Xliff> Zoffix: I get that, but everytime I use a parameter, I don't get the expected behavior.

[17:22] <Zoffix> Xliff: isn't that's because the first candidate doesn't take any positional arguments, so naturally if you do provide one, the first candidate won't be used?

[17:22] <Zoffix> Xliff: oh, misread, nm

[17:23] <Zoffix> Xliff: just make signature more specific than the other two candidates

[17:23] <Zoffix> or less specific

[17:27] <Xliff> Yes, but the method I want is never called. Specificity regardless.

[21:43] <hahainternet> so, 1/0 doesn't seem to generate a failure, just a rat, and the exception occurs when you include it in anything, but there's some weirdness as a result?

[21:43] <hahainternet> m: defined 1/0

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3301ddb1c: OUTPUT: ¬´WARNINGS for <tmp>:‚ê§Useless use of "defined 1/0" in expression "defined 1/0" in sink context (line 1)‚ê§¬ª

[21:43] <hahainternet> m: say defined 1/0

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3301ddb1c: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[21:43] <hahainternet> etc

[21:43] <hahainternet> bit odd?

[21:44] <hahainternet> i get how it might work, but it's still weird to me :)

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: you mean mathematically odd? That 1/0 is ‚Äúdefined‚Äù?

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> if it's not Nil then it is .defined, sure

[21:46] <hahainternet> well, i'd expect 1/0 to generate a failure, which wouldn't be defined

[21:47] <hahainternet> as it stands, it's a defined rat, but you can't detect it's erroneous

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: can you create a doc ticket about 1/0 Rats?

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> because https://docs.perl6.org/type/Rat doesn't even mention 1/0

[21:49] <hahainternet> it does sorta:

[21:49] <hahainternet> Returns False if numerator is 0, otherwise returns True. This applies for <0/0> zero-denominator Rational as well, despite ?<0/0>.Num being True.

[21:49] <hahainternet> under the bool method

[21:49] <hahainternet> so yeah, it's actually weirder

[21:49] <hahainternet> m: say so 1/0; say so 0/0;

[21:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3301ddb1c: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§False‚ê§¬ª

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> that's too far down

[21:49] <hahainternet> true, but is that behaviour even reasonable?

[21:50] <hahainternet> i guess a numerator of 0 does imply the number is 0, but still smells

[21:50] *** cjkinni left
[21:51] <AlexDaniel> hm, well, .Bool is for checking if something is non-zero

[21:51] <AlexDaniel> m: say so 0

[21:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3301ddb1c: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[21:51] <AlexDaniel> m: say so 0.0

[21:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3301ddb1c: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[21:51] <AlexDaniel> so it's sorta not related to division by zero

[21:51] *** cjkinni joined
[21:52] <AlexDaniel> so yeah, this isn't even about 1/0 Rats

[21:52] <hahainternet> sure, i understand why, but i would like to know whether a rational will cause an exception when printed, i don't think i can find that out without explicitly checking denominator can i?

[21:52] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cjkinni

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> and a doc ticket will help :)

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: generally if you want to handle exceptions you use try { }

[21:53] <hahainternet> sure, it just seems a case where i'd expect a Failure and for it to be false

[21:53] <hahainternet> i'll sort out a ticket tomorrow, 11pm for me

[21:55] *** silug left
[21:57] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: it's not a Failure, (1/0) is still a Rat

[21:57] <AlexDaniel> it only becomes a Failure when you do something with it

[21:57] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: i understand, and has a valid Num

[21:58] <hahainternet> but i can't predict it'll become a failure or test it can I? because it becomes an exception immediately?

[21:58] <hahainternet> i'd have to try/catch it, which i'm not opposed to
