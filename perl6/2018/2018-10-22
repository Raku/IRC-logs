[02:26] <moony> Decided that even if i didn't want to learn python, i need to know some general purpose language. Is perl6 or perl5 a good choice?

[02:27] <moony> (General purpose as in a scripting language for quickly whipping something up)

[02:27] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Actualeyes

[02:28] <SmokeMachine> imo both are good choices... (but im having more fun with perl6 these days...)

[02:29] <SmokeMachine> moony: ^^

[02:29] <moony> mk. Python bugs me because whitespace. At least both perls use brackets :P

[02:29] * moony watches moarvm compile in the backround

[02:30] <moony> ....what? minilua? Why does moarvm need a mini lua. :P

[02:30] *** dotdotdot left
[02:30] <SmokeMachine> sorry, what means mk.? https://www.perlmonks.org/?node=mk. ???

[02:30] <moony> well, ok, that's dynasm from luajit, but ok.

[02:31] <moony> SmokeMachine, Basically just "ok" but with an accent. :P

[02:31] <SmokeMachine> sorry...

[02:31] <moony> it's fine ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

[02:31] <AlexDaniel> moony: perl6 is my favorite language for quickly whipping things up :)

[02:31] <moony> AlexDaniel, i opened the perl6 in y minutes tutorial. Looks nice to me

[02:32] <moony> also looks like prime codegolfing material

[02:32] <AlexDaniel> moony: yes, see this for unicode-aware golfing: https://code-golf.io/

[02:32] <moony> maybe i'll finally have something besides golfing x86-64 to do for lels. (Don't ask me why i find golfing x86-64 fun, i just do somehow)

[02:33] <AlexDaniel> moony: if you want to get quickly into it, there's this: https://github.com/AlexDaniel/6lang-golf-cheatsheet

[02:34] <moony> i'll save the extra confusion golf brings for a bit later, but i'll bookmark that. Thanks

[02:34] <moony> > use the corresponding unicode character for numbers. 

[02:34] <moony> Oh my god. The devs think of everything, programming language edition

[02:34] *** dotdotdot joined
[02:34] <moony> it's nethack all over again haha

[02:35] <moony> looks like some of these might be useful in my own general code tho, compose key ftw

[02:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dotdotdot

[02:35] <moony> the ¬´¬ª enclosing pair looks useful

[02:35] <AlexDaniel> moony: yeah, the intention was to make things like ‚Öî usable

[02:36] <moony> wow. *clapclapclap* now i have a reason to have the compose key on all the time when i don't even know another language

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> so ÂÖÜ works just because unicode defines a numeric value for it too

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> m: say ÂÖÜ

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> hmmmm that's a wrong character, hold on :)

[02:37] <moony> what would be nice is if the default x11 compose key made typing the union and element of operators easy

[02:37] <moony> And i'm using noto, which has nearly everything :P

[02:39] <AlexDaniel> moony: oh, I just remembered that I wrote that post: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/23/day-23-the-wonders-of-perl6-golf/

[02:39] <AlexDaniel> which may be a nicer introduction to perl¬†6 golf

[02:39] *** dotdotdot left
[02:39] * moony tries building without using AUR for good measure

[02:41] <AlexDaniel> hmmm that error‚Ä¶ is it trying to use newer moarvm with older rakudo? Or vice versa?

[02:43] <moony> maybe. I'll do it the way the site recommends instead of using AUR. Probably just a buggy AUR script or a out of date dep

[02:44] <moony> also if perl 6 isn't embeddable that's an entire powerful usage of it lost :P

[02:45] <AlexDaniel> moony: as per https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry#XCompose_(Linux) I use https://github.com/kragen/xcompose/blob/master/dotXCompose

[02:45] <AlexDaniel> moony: it has set operators, but I struggle to remember how to type them sometimes. :)

[02:45] <moony> :P

[02:46] <moony> i have good keyboard memory, so it wont be too hard i dont think

[02:46] *** dotdotdot joined
[02:46] <AlexDaniel> moony: embeddable as in making standalone executable with rakudo built into them? No, we don't have that yet

[02:47] <moony> yea. Using rakudo from C-land for a DSL of sorts. Oh well.

[02:47] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dotdotdot

[02:47] <moony> now just gotta remember how to reload xcompose

[02:47] <AlexDaniel> you can't

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> afaik

[02:48] <moony> i3 might be able to. If not, rebooting i3 isn't hard

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> well yes, you'll have to restart your whole X session

[02:48] <AlexDaniel> just hitting mod+r in i3 isn't going to do it

[02:48] <moony> RIP. Alright

[02:49] * moony logs

[02:50] <moony> ZNC ftw, never miss a message

[02:52] *** dotdotdot left
[02:52] <moony> anyways, is there some list of what unicode shorthands perl6 has? :P

[02:53] <AlexDaniel> moony: alternatively use Matrix. Never miss a message unless the bug with messages not being received is still unfixed. https://matrix.org/

[02:53] <AlexDaniel> moony: yes, see this: https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_ascii

[02:53] <moony> no matrix pls. I'm happy with hexchat :P

[02:53] <moony> also i have my own server, so ZNC is easy anyways

[02:54] <AlexDaniel`> That's OK too.

[02:54] <yoleaux> 8 Oct 2018 06:11Z <japhb> AlexDaniel`: I've got a decent draft of my ratchet-rakudo script running.  I'm going to leave it looping overnight, and see how far it gets.

[02:54] * AlexDaniel` waves from Matrix

[02:55] *** dotdotdot joined
[02:55] <moony> Judging on that list, perl6 uses some sort of vectorization?

[02:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dotdotdot

[02:56] <AlexDaniel> moony: what do you mean?

[02:56] <moony> as in, say, the + operator can do 1 + 2 = 3, or [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6]

[02:56] <moony> while still being the same op

[02:56] <AlexDaniel> you can use Z and X metaops

[02:56] <AlexDaniel> aah

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> ok I see what you mean now

[02:57] <moony> that is, of course, unless (<) and (>) are singular tokens, not some special modified < and >

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> moony: maybe you're looking for junctions? https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction

[02:58] <moony> Yep, that's the vectorization i'm refering to.

[03:01] <moony> kinda suprised 

[03:01] <moony> shoot

[03:02] <moony> hexchat pls stop eating my compose key

[03:02] <moony> i can only type some symbols and not others because you're a derp

[03:05] <AlexDaniel> moony: did you do the GTK_IM_MODULE hack?

[03:05] <AlexDaniel> moony: described here https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry#Getting_compose_working_in_all_programs

[03:05] <AlexDaniel> without it applications will treat compose key very inconsistently

[03:12] *** dotdotdot left
[03:15] <MasterDuke> moony: i've never tried the rakudo-star aur package, but the plain rakudo one works fine

[03:15] <moony> AlexDaniel, looked at the node.js to perl 6 thing in docs. Perl 6 has ===. Now i'm even more curious why ‚â° isn't ued :P

[03:27] <moony> it is

[03:28] <moony> Apparently `sub bar($name? = "moo")` is valid syntax, which makes no sense. An optional argument with a default value ü§î 

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> moony: it's just the default

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> moony: i.e. it's optional for the user, and if you don't pass it then it's initialized to the default value

[03:30] <AlexDaniel> moony: what doesn't make sense is a required parameter with a default value

[03:30] <AlexDaniel> moony: and that gives a nice compile-time error

[13:43] <Xliff> Is bisect an IRC only tool, or is there a command line tool out there that I can use?

[13:45] *** dotdotdot joined
[13:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dotdotdot

[13:48] <moritz> I'm pretty sure you can use it without IRC, but then you need a big collection of rakudo builds to bisect on

[13:50] <moritz> https://github.com/perl6/whateverable has the code

[14:00] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: I have read something about a tool called blib (I think) that bisects offline

[14:00] *** dotdotdot left
[14:00] <Xliff> SmokeMachine++ moritz++ # Thanks

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: whateverable not only has code, but also rakudo builds for every commit

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: if your module regressed and you want to bisect that, then you can use blin https://github.com/perl6/Blin

[14:02] <SmokeMachine> yes, blin!

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> :)

[14:02] *** ExtraCrispy left

[14:03] <Xliff> I have a VM

[14:03] <Xliff> And also a dual boot partition.

[14:03] <Xliff> OK, so Whateverable it is! :)

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: but may I ask what you're trying to bisect? I can assist perhaps

[14:03] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: I was writing a gist about it. Let's see if it is ready for a draft.

[14:04] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/010d1ea5a92ea6e3524e70f0a1b4b77a

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: because generally we should be able to feed a gist directly to bisectable and it will work

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> ahhh gtk‚Ä¶ hmm

[14:04] <Xliff> Don't assume it's GTK, yet. :)

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> that won't work without a running X server, right?

[14:05] <Xliff> Er... no.

[14:05] <Xliff> Although the error message you get should be different.

[14:05] <Xliff> So... it's RUNNABLE, but you may not get to the error because gtk_init() will complain of missing DISPLAY

[14:06] <Xliff> So I will grab whateverable.

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> right

[14:06] *** zakharyas left
[14:06] <Xliff> How big is it?

[14:06] *** zakharyas joined
[14:07] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: you mean the storage for whateverable? A few tens of gigabytes, but you only need to fetch the required builds so that doesn't matter

[14:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zakharyas

[14:07] <Xliff> Where can I get those?

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> shareable6: HEAD

[14:08] <shareable6> AlexDaniel, https://whateverable.6lang.org/HEAD

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> you'd need to `apt install zstd lrzip`

[14:08] <Xliff> zst?

[14:08] <Xliff> :)

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: hold on‚Ä¶ let's build a tool maybe?

[14:09] <Xliff> Sure

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: it should be a few lines of code, let's see if I can come up with a short hello world

[14:12] <Xliff> Meanwhile I am running a bisect similar process on my code.

[14:14] <AlexDaniel> yeah, it can be done without whateverable, just needs patience to wait for required rakudo revisions to build. Also you need to be careful with broken revisions (these must be skipped with 125 exit code)

[14:16] <Xliff> Build script can do that, yeah?

[14:16] <Xliff> Skipping broken revisions?

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> mmm I don't think so? You need some way of figuring that out, like based on the exit code of make maybe?

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> that's what makes whateverable awesome, it does that for you

[14:18] <SmokeMachine> `ü•û Will use up to 0 threads for testing modules`?

[14:19] <SmokeMachine> 0 threads but its running...

[14:20] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: :D

[14:20] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: that's awesome, I guess you don't have `nproc` installed?

[14:20] *** dotdotdot joined
[14:21] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: you can use --nproc=4 or something like that explicitly

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: yeah https://github.com/perl6/Blin#running

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> I'm assuming you can't just take and run a linux build on a mac, right?

[14:24] <Xliff> Damn.

[14:24] <Xliff> Getting this: MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler

[14:24] <SmokeMachine> :(

[14:24] <Xliff> And it looks like recent changes have prevented perl6 from picking up exceptions in callbacks.

[14:24] <SmokeMachine> but it was running... :(

[14:25] <Xliff> It still is running, however I don't have proper error messages.

[14:25] *** dotdotdot left
[14:25] <Xliff> Which makes debugging code MUCH harder.

[14:25] <Xliff> So now I must bisect my own code! :P

[14:27] *** pmurias left
[14:27] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: we can try fixing that, but it's work. One way is to have someone build rakudo on a bunch of commits and then contribute them. Another is to make whateverable build on demand (i.e. if build X cannot be fetched, it should try building by itself)

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> that will be much much slower of course, and the point is kinda lost

[14:28] <SmokeMachine> hum... you were talking about rakudo builds... now that make sense on my head!

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> but it's better than having a tool that doesn't work at all

[14:28] *** pmurias joined
[14:28] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[14:29] <SmokeMachine> I was thinking that Blin would build that if it couldn't find that built...

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: yeah. So bisection typically takes like what, 12 steps I think? Plus some skipped revisions and stuff. So if it takes you say 3 minutes to build rakudo, then it's 3 √ó 12 minutes just to bisect one thing

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> which is fine, actually

[14:29] <AlexDaniel> but the idea behind whateverable was to do it in 5 seconds :)

[14:30] <AlexDaniel> which it does. Blin is a bit slower because of zef overhead, but it's still less than 3 minutes for a module I think

[14:31] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: so here's the start: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/fb18003ca2b5e47337d8a6926f706ba0

[15:48] <yoleaux> Xliff: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[15:49] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: I'm still interested to know when this changed

[16:12] <Xliff> Except in my code.

[16:12] <Xliff> Which I will now revert back.

[23:15] <Xliff> Is there a way to monitor the Linux kernel for process creation, and deletion?

[23:18] *** dotdotdot left
[23:20] <timotimo> yes!

[23:20] <timotimo> Xliff: search for "execsnoop", it's a tool by brendan gregg if i'm not mistaken, and it logs every exec, which should come quite close to what you need

[23:20] <timotimo> perhaps it's easy to modify it to make an "exitsnoop", or maybe someone already did that

[23:21] <Xliff> timotimo++

[23:22] <Xliff> I also found forkstat, which is available on Ubuntu and Debian.

[23:22] <Xliff> I will look into execsnoop. Thanks!

[23:22] <timotimo> that also sounds nice, but perhaps it's more like a statistics thing?

[23:22] *** dotdotdot joined
[23:23] <Xliff> Heh. Donno. I queried the oracle for "linux /proc monitoring" and found it after a few variations.

[23:23] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dotdotdot

[23:23] <Xliff> "the oracle" == Google

[23:23] <Xliff> Does execsnoop need to be run as root?

[23:24] <timotimo> hm, probably

[23:24] <timotimo> you could give the user who wants to do it more permissions and/or set the flags that govern what individual processes/users are allowed to trace less paranoid

[23:24] <Xliff> True enough.

[23:30] <Xliff> Hmmm....

[23:30] <Xliff> execsnoop is not picking up some of the commands I am seeing from forkstat

[23:31] <timotimo> not all forks lead to execs

[23:31] <Xliff> True enough! Still, thanks for the tip!

[23:31] <timotimo> and not all execs come immediately after forks

[23:31] <timotimo> sure! :)

[23:31] <Xliff> forkstat seems to catch what I want.

[23:34] <Xliff> What would be the best way to grab output from a command like 'tail -f'?

[23:37] <geekosaur> modulo buffering, which will require either wrapping in stdbuf or using a pty

[23:37] <timotimo> oh, hmm

[23:38] <geekosaur> stdbuf -o0 tail -f ...

[23:38] <geekosaur> or -oL

[23:39] <Xliff> Really?

[23:39] <geekosaur> tail will see it's outputting to a pipe and use block buffering. you cannot change this from the perl side

[23:40] <Xliff> What about programs like forkstat? ;)

[23:40] <Xliff> Although it does look like it is buffering.

[23:41] <geekosaur> don't know. ltrace might tell you if it alters buffering
