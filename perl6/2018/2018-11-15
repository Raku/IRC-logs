[00:33] <thundergnat> Should a failed open() set $! ? I was under the impression that it would but it doesn't on my system. 

[00:34] <thundergnat> m: open("bogus/directory/file.txt") or die $! # EG

[00:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3f03e677: OUTPUT: «␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:35] <thundergnat> Or am I perhaps just confused with Perl 5?

[00:36] *** yqt left
[00:37] *** w_richard_w left
[00:37] <thundergnat> The docs imply that it will return a failure, but not exactly where that failure will be set.

[00:37] *** Sound left
[00:38] *** Actualeyes left
[00:42] <Xliff> thundergnat: If open fails, it should throw an exception.

[00:44] <thundergnat> Yeah, it should... but where is that exception so I can pass it along? It isn't in $_, it isn't in $!. Where is it? 

[00:46] <MasterDuke> saw this in hackernews, thought people might be interested http://rosie-lang.org/, a PEG implementation

[00:47] <thundergnat> A failed open definitely returns a Falsey value because the die gets called above, but I'd like to let the user know _why_ it failed.  

[00:47] <Xliff> thundergnat: You'd have to use a try/catch block to inspect the exception and react accordingly.

[00:56] <thundergnat> eval open("bogus/directory/file.txt") or die $! # perl5

[00:56] <thundergnat> bah, no perl5 bot.

[01:06] <thundergnat> Well, after poking around a bit in roast, it looks like a failed open DOESN'T return a failure, despite what the docs say, it just returns an undefined value and somehow _you_ have to figure out why it failed.. That's LTA. (I would be delighted to be proven wrong.)

[01:13] <thundergnat> Ok, if you actually want to get a failure, you need to pass a file handle to open, not just a path string.

[01:14] <thundergnat> m: my $fh = "bogus/directory/file.txt".IO; open($fh) or die $!

[01:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3f03e677: OUTPUT: «␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:14] <thundergnat> Nope. That doesn't work either. Sigh.

[01:17] <SmokeMachine> does any one have any idea why on this function (https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/better-clouser-runner/lib/Red/ResultSeq.pm6#L64) the `%poss` inside the `CONTROL` is different from outside?

[01:18] <SmokeMachine> here's how I test it... https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ZQcMCU99/

[01:18] <thundergnat> m: my $fh = IO::Handle.new( :path( "bogus/directory/file.txt".IO.path ) ).open or die $! # ok, I give up

[01:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar c3f03e677: OUTPUT: «IO::Handle is disallowed in restricted setting␤  in sub restricted at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 1␤  in method new at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 32␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:27] <MasterDuke> thundergnat: you can use evalable6 or committable6 for i/o stuff, they don't use the restricted settings

[01:33] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel, jmerelo: squashathons once a month might be hard to keep up. maybe align them right before star releases? could do something like one for docs, one for roast, one for ecosystem unbitrotting, and one whatever else is decided

[13:19] <azawawi> https://blog.discourse.org/2018/11/free-hosting-for-open-source-v2/ # if we're interested in a perl6 users discourse free hosting site

[13:22] <lizmat> looks interesting I guess

[13:22] <azawawi> :(

[13:22] <azawawi> lizmat: hi :)

[13:23] <azawawi> lizmat: http://meta.discourse.org/

[13:24] <azawawi> i started working on https://github.com/azawawi/p6-webservice-discourse to be able to use it from perl6

[13:24] <azawawi> wip

[13:25] <azawawi> most actions you do on the discourse website can be done with the api

[13:27] <azawawi> WebService::Discourse once finished  would be able to do these tasks https://github.com/discourse/discourse_api/tree/master/examples

[16:09] <jnthn> Is there any way to make these things blow up a bit more eagerly?

[16:11] <jnthn> Also for debate: should `to-json` be turning these into NaN?

[16:12] <jnthn> Because, at least for JSON::Fast, it explodes.

[16:12] <jnthn> oh, apparently JSON doesn't allow NaN?

[16:13] <jnthn> I probably exception rather than NaN anyway, in my case, though.

[16:14] <jnthn> (For detecting it)

[16:15] <AlexDaniel> yeah but what about infinity

[16:16] <AlexDaniel> maybe .denominator == 0 ?

[16:16] <jnthn> ah, good point

[16:17] <AlexDaniel> there's also .norm

[16:17] <jnthn> m: my $x = 0/0; dd $x.norm
