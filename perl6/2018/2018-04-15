[04:19] <Zoffix> Herby_: the issue isn't present on 2018.03

[04:20] <Zoffix> you need latest and greatest

[08:05] <AlexDaniel> in other words whateverable binaries will simply be a cheat to get the test result faster

[09:14] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: issues simply for discussion, not for fixing anything on the documents

[09:14] <donpdonp> maybe have a cronjob alter if the notAfter date is < 30 days

[09:14] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: that's what “style” is for I think

[09:15] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: you meant it was when it was called meta. 

[09:15] <moritz> donpdonp: that's what the cronjob does; it's just that I want to monitor the cronjob manually after I changed it

[09:16] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right now it's for "writing style, repository organization, etc". 

[09:16] <donpdonp> moritz: oh ok. if the date check and alert is small-ish, id like to see it in a gist.github.org so i can use it myself :)

[09:16] * AlexDaniel renames it to “meta”

[09:17] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: maybe we should change it back to meta and add "request for comments and general discussion" to the description

[09:18] <AlexDaniel> done I think

[10:37] <moritz> Zoffix: seems /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf came from the .deb package

[10:38] <moritz> so I'll install that again

[10:38] <Zoffix> What about fullchain.pem? (and when I dissited alerts, it wanted cert.pem for design.perl6.org)

[10:39] <Zoffix> .oO( keep .deb uninstalled; blow away all of -le-ssl.confs and re-enable them anew with /root/certbot-auto )

[10:48] <Zoffix> peace

[10:49] <jmerelo> So we're 18 days away from the squashathon and I'd like a bit of help. There are a bunch of good first issue here already https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22, but I'd like you to identify a few more among the ones you have created or handled lately. We'll try to get some new people, even those not familiar with perl6, to help with that

[10:49] <Zoffix> (and yeah, I know httpbin.org, but it ain't got the get-without-content-length this test wants to test)

[10:56] <jmerelo> Using a custom Docker environment for testing shaves 7 minutes more off perl6/doc build https://travis-ci.org/JJ/doc/builds/366746502 However, there's an error with the whateverable option I can't quite figure out.

[10:56] <jmerelo> Actually, cuts it in half, from ~20 mins to ~10 mins https://travis-ci.org/perl6/doc

[10:56] <moritz> nice!

[10:57] <jmerelo> Anyway, I'm not merging until I leave the whateverable and maybe other options as fallback... 

[10:57] <jmerelo> Help with the Whateverable error will be appreciated :-)

[10:57] <Zoffix> jmerelo: is it still present? The site it's hosted on was out of space a few hours ago

[10:58] <AlexDaniel> not out of space anymore though

[10:58] <AlexDaniel> and should work just fine

[10:58] <jmerelo> Zoffix: AlexDaniel fixed that pretty fast. In fact, that error prompted me to work on this as long as whateverable was not available. Now it's back, but, well...

[10:59] <AlexDaniel> it's definitely great to have fallbacks, yeah

[10:59] *** jmerelo left
[10:59] <AlexDaniel> though if docker solves everything then I don't know if whateverable option is needed at all

[11:04] <moritz> what is that whateverable option?

[11:04] <AlexDaniel> instead of building rakudo it just pulls it from whateverable

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> so we get tests results faster while still using rakudo HEAD

[11:05] <moritz> ah, nice

[11:05] <Zoffix> moritz: any idea why http://no-ssl-http-module-tester.perl6.org keeps redirecting me to perl6.org?

[11:06] <Zoffix> After I enabled that site in apache

[11:06] <Zoffix> oh

[11:06] <Zoffix> I used p6c. instead of perl.org

[14:05] <Zoffix> tyil: what do you mean by HSTS? The Strict-Transport-Security header?

[14:05] <tyil> you can unset HSTS easily though

[14:05] <tyil> Zoffix: yes

[14:05] <mspo> tyil: except it's cached

[14:05] <tyil> mspo: so is a redirect

[14:06] <mspo> okay

[14:06] <timotimo> i thought the point of HSTS is that you cannot unset it after you've set it?

[14:06] <Zoffix> $ curl -si https://rakudo.org | grep ^Strict

[14:06] <Zoffix> Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains;

[14:06] <mspo> timotimo: you can give a max-age

[14:06] <mspo> yeah

[14:06] <tyil> timotimo: you can update the HSTS header with a timespan of 0, which will overwrite the old one

[14:06] <tyil> Zoffix: I'm curling rakudo.org

[14:06] <tyil> without the https

[14:06] <timotimo> ah, i guess that makes sense

[14:06] <tyil> ie, the thing people will type in to their browsers

[14:07] <Zoffix> tyil: is it meant to be set on non-HTTPS virtual host too?

[14:07] <timotimo> since you'll have to have a proper certificate in order to singal that

[14:07] <tyil> Zoffix: unless you redirect http to https by default, yes

[14:07] <tyil> otherwise I'd indeed set it on https only, yes

[14:07] <Zoffix> We redirect http to https

[14:07] <tyil> doesnt seem like it

[14:08] <tyil> firefox doesnt do it for me

[14:08] <tyil> and curl gives a 200

[16:40] <jmerelo> Any idea anyone of what is happening here? https://travis-ci.org/JJ/doc/jobs/366746503 See the error at the end. 

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> oooh

[16:43] <FROGGS> if [ "" != "" ]; then prove -j  -e perl6 t; else prove -e perl6 t; fi

[16:43] <FROGGS> this looks strange

[16:44] <FROGGS> is the job number missing?

[16:44] <jmerelo> FROGGS: it's the same line there were before in .travis.yml. Only thing I've done is to move it to a script.

[16:44] <jmerelo> That line checks if we want to run prove in parallel with -j NUMBER-OF-JOBS

[16:45] <jmerelo> The "else" is what is actually been run, same as before, but I'm getting that error I can't really figure out. My hunch is that it's got to do something with environment variables.

[16:46] * AlexDaniel has no idea

[16:47] <jmerelo> I'm debugging Makefiles, of all things https://travis-ci.org/JJ/doc/jobs/366832303 Looks like it's lots its $PATH (no pun intended)

[17:56] <Geth> ¦ doc: be used to add some other parallel tests if needed, based in rakudo

[17:56] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/63b9d9c4ca

[17:58] <jmerelo> As seen in the latest travis test, time reduced by one third https://travis-ci.org/JJ/doc/builds/366848152

[18:00] <moritz> jmerelo++

[18:08] <jmerelo> I'm kinda thinking now. We could use this to run everything in parallel. The test does two things: run t/* tests and also make htmlify. We don't need to do that sequentially. 

[18:08] <AlexDaniel> 15m vs 10m is a noticeable difference. jmerelo++

[18:09] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel, moritz: basic thing is that everything is in this Docker container https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/perl6-doccer/

[18:10] <jmerelo> I can move it to a perl6/ repo, if you don't feel comfortable with using an external repo.

[18:11] *** |oLa| left
[18:12] <jmerelo> That image is only 291 MBs, so downloading it is quite fast.

[18:45] <El_Che> jmerelo: I not convinced that docker is the way to go. it still needs huge downloads

[18:45] <yoleaux> 13 Apr 2018 22:37Z <Zoffix> El_Che: how did you figure p6lert-web service had its mem limit set near the VM limit? It's got 19GB of RAM and currently uses 1.8GB

[18:45] <El_Che> Zoffix: by misreading the total ram size :)

[18:46] <El_Che> jmerelo: I use docker for the portability (build and test on different OSes than Ubuntu 14.04)

[18:53] <tobs> what's a good way to put this translation table into a sub ($degree --> Str): http://snowfence.umn.edu/Components/winddirectionanddegreeswithouttable3.htm

[18:53] <tobs> I think I need a range type for Rat modulo 360

[18:54] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: not far from there :-)

[18:54] <tobs> and then use given-when

[18:55] <jmerelo> El_Che: c'mon, half a gig. Takes 13 seconds to download. We could maybe shave a few seconds there, but that's not going to be critical.

[18:57] <El_Che> jmerelo: that's the alpine one

[18:57] <El_Che> I don't think alpine is a good test best

[18:57] <El_Che> too many edge case

[18:57] <El_Che> too many times when stuff doesn't build right without workarounds

[18:57] <El_Che> (I mean it's ok for doc)

[18:58] <El_Che> what if extra packages are needed? weird deps?

[18:58] <jmerelo> El_Che: I'm using it also for my modules, which are not in those edge cases. Still, using docker containers are a big improvement over compiling rakudo every single time.

[18:58] <El_Che> docker for docs is ok, docker for regular travis testing is too much technical overhead

[18:58] <jmerelo> El_Che: packages might be a good option, too. 

[18:59] <El_Che> jmerelo: *everything* an improvement than compiling

[18:59] <jmerelo> El_Che: maybe submit it as an option, an alternative build environment. Call it perl6docker or somesuch

[19:00] <jnthn> tobs: Well, could write it as something like `given $degree { when 11.25 .. 33.75 { 'NWE' } ... }` and a Range will smart-match to the values between the min and max. But the table is unclear what happens with a boundary value; I guess you'd want to use ..^ or ^.. to exclude the appropriate endpoint if it matters. The first line wraps around 0 but could just put it in `default { 'N' }`.

[19:01] <tobs> jnthn: right, 'N' is the only one misbehaving. Thanks.

[19:26] <brrt> hey #perl6. am i correct in thinking that all perl6 grammars construct (effectively) recursive-descent parsers?

[19:33] <moritz> brrt: yes, unless you mix them with code that does something else

[19:34] <moritz> brrt: like, you can also structure them as tokenizers, and let an operating precence parser structure them

[19:34] <brrt> hmm

[19:35] *** HaraldJoerg joined
[19:35] <brrt> we could potentially optimize them to state machines then

[19:35] *** aindilis joined
[19:35] <brrt> at least the class of parsers that are simple enough

[19:35] <moritz> the declarative part is already handled by an NFA

[19:36] <brrt> oh, interesting

[19:38] *** Kaiepi joined
[19:39] <moritz> chapter 6 of P6R has more on that :-)

[19:39] <jnthn> Effectively, you write as if it's recursive descent, but we then generate a lexer that means we don't have to go exploring all of the paths that one would with normal recursive descent.

[19:41] <brrt> oh. hehe. that's pretty cool

[19:41] <brrt> where can i order that book :-)
