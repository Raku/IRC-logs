[10:12] <Zoffix> You're not opposed to shit. You're just bent on playing a dick measuring contest.

[10:13] <Zoffix> You're the only committer on this page: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/commits/master/source/downloads/others.html 

[10:13] <Zoffix> It doesn't even bother saying the Linux and macOS sections offer different things. It just omits "Star" in the names.

[10:14] <Zoffix> But when Rakudo Star section is clearly deliniated and compiler-only offerings are explained http://hack.p6c.org:4242/files  all of a sudden you oppose because of "user confusion".

[10:36] <Zoffix> release. So nothing is changing with respect to that, except we'll actually clarify the difference so there would be LESS CONFUSION.

In your eagerness to criticize, you don't even realize that this http://hack.p6c.org:4242/files is a replacement for this http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/ not this https://perl6.org/downloads/  The perl6.org main download page would still offer Star only with http://hack.p6c.org:4242/files linked to under "other download options". The point I explicitly

[10:41] <Zoffix> stated on the bikeshed Issue: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/issues/93#issuecomment-371665629 and the only reason you think we'd be offering the "confusing" Rakudo-Only packages from perl6.org/downloads is because I posted a draft screenshot of **rakudo.org page** saying I'd like the perl6.org page to be **functionally similiar**, i.e. with platform-detection:

[10:58] <bbkr> As for "to Star or not to Star" debate I think https://perl6.org/downloads/others.html misses the most important info - WHICH packages are included in Star? If I have task to solve, let's say connect to Redis, as a user I still don't know if Star is good for me or not.

[11:00] <bbkr> So http://hack.p6c.org:4242/files is a bit more informative here.

[11:01] <stmuk> bbkr: its an arbitary selection of modules "likely to be useful", very roughly something like a core stdlib. I'd expect to be able to make web requests with it but I wouldn't expect database drivers (which often need DB libs) to be present

[11:02] <El_Che> the difference with a stdlib is that that is expected to be a static given

[11:02] *** xtreak joined
[11:02] <stmuk> bbkr: that page is bad because it offers "rakudo compiler" directly to end users along with "rakudo star"

[11:02] <El_Che> there is no warranties on the ecosystem, or even rakudo release-to-release for that matter

[11:06] <stmuk> I'm not opposed to offering nxadm's packages (which are useful to people) but I think they should be on a "drill down" type page rather than directly on the download page

[11:08] <bbkr> I know Star distro from day 0. And IMO whole release model is bad. Star should not compete with compiler, it should be added on top of it. So I should be able to BOTH "brew rakudo" AND brew "rakudo-star", where rakudo-star only adds zef and modules and has rakudo as dependency. Star should not contain compiler, it should depend on it. That's more flexible.

[11:08] <timotimo> it was important to the star process to have a very well-tested compiler version + module versions

[11:09] *** pierre_ joined
[11:09] <timotimo> if a rakudo-star package just took whatever compiler your distro currently offers and installs whatever current versions of the "bundled" modules from the ecosystem, that is lost

[11:10] <timotimo> to be fair, the actual amount of well-testing rakudo star has been lackluster with regards to community volunteering

[11:10] <El_Che> I like the Task:: idea of perl5

[11:10] <El_Che> shortcut for the lazy :)

[11:10] <stmuk> I was hoping star might become a sort of Medium Term Support version of rakudo based on a stable compiler version (similar to what timotimo is saying I think)

[11:11] <stmuk> El_Che: Task::Star has been problematic ... there are actually two 

[11:11] <El_Che> yeah, I remember

[11:11] <El_Che> stmuk: at the speed rakudo advanced, medium term sounds not desireble

[11:12] <El_Che> maybe once the developments settles

[11:13] <stmuk> El_Che: yes I suspect its still years off

[11:14] <El_Che> I started with star on my docker containers

[11:14] *** pierre_ left
[11:14] <El_Che> but had to give it up because of that

[11:14] <stmuk> but to be frank whenever star is discussed there is no consensus about what it should be 

[11:14] <stmuk> so we are probably stuck with what we have

[11:15] <stmuk> I have thought of a "mini-Star" which just had docs and zef

[11:16] *** Zoffix joined
[11:16] <bbkr> timotimo: Nothing prevents Star to require _very specific_ compiler package. And that gives user freedom. 

[11:16] <stmuk> particularly use of the base compiler means people don't use p6doc (or even know it exists)

[11:17] <El_Che> I think the main problem is considering something as a stdlib when the author may not see it that way

[11:17] <Zoffix> stmuk: dude, the perl.org/downloads would still offer star only with "drill down" to other options. That was always the plan. You're criticizing the wrong site. http://hack.p6c.org:4242/files is replacement for http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/ which already does mention compiler only options in adhoc manner

[11:18] <Zoffix> Would someone tell him that since he apparently has me "blocked for a month"?

[11:18] <stmuk> El_Che: I don't understand you. Noone said its a stdlib

[11:22] *** zakharyas left
[11:22] <stmuk> what I'm seeing now looks reasonable

[11:23] <bbkr> just take a look at debian. they did it right. meta package perl = perl-base + perl-modules + perl-docs. this way user can install whatever he wants and there are no 2 competing "brands" (bare perl / perl with modules) that are confusing.

[11:23] *** cdg joined
[11:25] <stmuk> bbkr: I'm a debian fan but I find that annoying. Typically debian perl users may not have perldoc or prove installed. Debian does that because they target embedded systems but disk space is cheap and I'm rather see docs with my lang runtime

[11:26] <bbkr> Star = perl-modules and perl-docs. I don't see a reason why it is separate brand.

[11:26] <bbkr> That's not annoying, that's lifesaver

[11:26] <bbkr> have you ever tried updating Perl on hundreds of docker images?

[11:27] <stmuk> yes

[11:27] *** xtreak left
[11:27] *** xtreak_ joined
[11:27] <bbkr> storage is cheap but in some cases it's good to have an option and skip modules you don't need in particular case.

[11:28] *** cdg left
[11:29] <stmuk> the download pages are targeting desktop users not docker users. docker images of perl 6 exist

[11:37] *** cdg left
[11:40] <bbkr> I'm talking about general principle from DevOp point of view. I'm happy to just "install perl" with all the goodies and develop something. But for release I want slim and tailored environment. I don't need PDF docs on production servers for example. So production gets "install perl-base" and manual installation of minimal required module set. And I can be pretty sure that it works because on devel and production I use the same comp

[11:40] <bbkr> iler package. While in current Star model I'm forced to install all the stuff everywhere because it is built with compiler, not on top of it.

[11:41] <stmuk> so don't use star

[11:42] <moritz> I think deploying rakudo applications at scale using anything but Docker will be a PITA

[13:48] <geekosaur> I... think that's not supposed to be a combination

[13:49] <geekosaur> (seems like binding a state var would "break" its state-ness?)

[13:49] <geekosaur> but here it breaks even more because nothing was expecting that to become broken

[13:49] *** zakharyas joined
[13:49] <Kaiepi> is it possible to have an immutable state variable?

[13:50] <geekosaur> it seems slightly contradictory, unless you're being overly clever about a constant

[13:50] *** lalitmee left
[13:50] *** mcmillhj joined
[13:50] <geekosaur> "state variable" is a specific form of mutability

[13:51] <El_Che> Kaiepi: it should be a weird use case

[13:51] *** zakharyas left
[13:51] *** zakharyas joined
[13:51] <geekosaur> that is, it's a mutable container whose identity is defined by its lexical location

[13:52] <Kaiepi> it is a pretty weird use case

[13:52] <geekosaur> binding it breaks both the mutability and the container identity, leading to Mu because it isn;t attached to anything any more (state vars need speciifc compiler support, which stops working if you bind them)

[13:53] <Kaiepi> ah

[13:53] <Kaiepi> ok that makes sense

[13:53] <geekosaur> so really that usage should throw a compile time error

[13:53] <geekosaur> since the compiler won;t be able to do anything sensible with it

[13:57] <geekosaur> I really don't know what you would intend with an immutable state var though. sounds like a constant mixed with some confusion over what a state var is

[13:58] <geekosaur> normal vars come into existence when their context does --- so if they're defined in a function, they come into existence when the function is called

[13:59] <geekosaur> state vars are defined solely by their location -- so, if defined within a function, the same variable / mutable container is used in every call, not a new one for each call

[13:59] <geekosaur> but both are mutable containers. if it's immutable, seems like it's just a constant (possibly a constant with local scope / visibility)

[14:00] *** Zoffix joined

[14:02] *** SHODAN joined
[14:02] <Zoffix> (and looks like the return of `once` adds an unwanted container)

[16:50] <Zoffix> perl6 bin/toaster-perl6 2017.07 master 2018.02 will toast 2017.07, then master, then 2018.02 release

[16:50] *** Kaiepi joined
[16:50] <Zoffix> Ah, I guess you want master + latest stable; `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags` would give you latest tag

[16:52] <tbrowder_>  Zoffix: i‚Äôm looking at just he latest stable at first, but maybe adding  current master later. i need some baby steps here while unwinding your golf-style of coding...

[16:53] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: or even without needing to have checkout handy: perl6 bin/toaster-perl6 $(TMP=$(mktemp -d); git clone -q --no-checkout --depth 1 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git ${TMP} > /dev/null 2>&1 && cd $dir && git -C ${TMP} show master:VERSION && rm -rf ${TMP}) master

[16:53] <tbrowder_> which of course is optimum for running, but not so optimum for lesser beings

[16:56] *** vcv left
[16:56] <tbrowder_>  i also plan to add more qc items and tracking dependency tests for failing modules, probably ‚Äúover-engineering‚Äù and feature explosion...

[16:57] <stmuk_> tbrowder_: https://github.com/stmuk/rakudup/blob/master/rakudup#L31

[16:58] <tbrowder_> the use of multiple cores is interesting, but i‚Äôm holding off for the moment. also will use postgesql.

[17:02] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: note that the working viewer is Perl 5 version and uses SQLite. So you'd need to update it to work with Pg (or make the P6 version working; it's slightly out of date and also nomed all my RAM last time I used it 6-12 months ago)

[17:03] <Zoffix> Oh, I think it uses Tardigrade even... :o Maybe it'd need a rewrite entirely then, to something like Cro

[17:03] <[Coke]> any love for getting perl6 --doc to format tables with visible cells?

[17:05] <[Coke]> (pod tables) and/or as indented in text mode.

[17:10] <Zoffix> [Coke]: yes, but only by editing Pod::To::Text a little

[17:11] <[Coke]> Any preference for ascii table vs. unicode table vs. indent only?

[17:12] <[Coke]> (I can put together a PR)

[17:13] <Zoffix> Looking at the output right now and I'd say indent-only table looks the easier to read

[17:13] <Zoffix> I added `--------------` between rows and that looks awful

[17:13] <Zoffix> and `|` between columns kinda makes non-textual data in cells tougheer to read

[17:14] <[Coke]> ok. and the indent also has a prayer of not breaking the spec test.

[17:18] <stmuk_> Zoffix: I'm confused. So we get a new rakudo.org which resembles the old (but without download) and the download on perl6.org gets updated later? Or something else

[17:19] *** vcv joined
[17:19] <Zoffix> stmuk_: we get a new rakudo.org that resembles the old and with download and the download on perl6.org gets updated later.

[17:20] <Zoffix> stmuk_: basically all the changes from here: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/issues/96#issue-304368951  minus all perl6.org changes and minus the API bit

[17:20] <Zoffix> That will be done now.

[17:21] <stmuk_> moving to just having one dl page is Progress (whatever the details of exactly what happens)

[17:21] <stmuk_> Zoffix++

[17:21] <Zoffix> And later, we move all the downloads to perl6.org and, I guess, leave rakudo.org just a cover page that links to someplace on perl6.org 

[17:22] <stmuk_> I guess the actual binaries are probably hosted on rakudo.org?

[17:23] <El_Che> Zoffix: I left a note on your commit, the packages I produces do include zef

[17:23] <El_Che> and like Yoda talk I

[17:25] <stmuk_> . o O ( and niecza gets re-added in the feature comparison ;) )

[17:25] <Zoffix> After rakudo.org update both rakudo.org, perl6.org (and rakudo.perl6.org) will live on the same server, so they'll need to be uploaded just once. But rakudo.org will have some sort of way to cater via the old links (the ones that always link to latest release, etc)
