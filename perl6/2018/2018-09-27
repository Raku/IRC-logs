[02:16] <knation> I am a perl 5 dev and looking to get started with perl 6, I am running into a problem that I am sure has a simple solution. I am looking to import a module into another file, I have the following file structure: bin/main.pm6 and I want to import from bin/Controller/Test.pm6

[02:16] <knation> I have read that this is the correct syntax in my main.pm6 file: `use lib 'Controller::Test'` but it does not seem to be able to find the module

[02:19] *** ZzZombo left

[02:20] <geekosaur> use lib adds a director tot he module path

[02:20] <geekosaur> use Controller::Test;

[02:20] <geekosaur> if it's in the current directory then you may need:   use lib '.';

[02:20] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aijony

[02:21] <geekosaur> this is more or less the same as perl 5 except that perl 6 likes to use precompiled modules instead of perl 6 source

[07:07] <tyil> been looking at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Main.pm#L17, to see if I can fix one of these TODOs

[07:08] <jmerelo> tyil: that would be great.

[07:08] <jmerelo> tyil: I raised a couple of issues about EnumHOW, don't know if you have seen them (maybe you have and that's why you're telling me)

[07:11] <jmerelo> tyil: you might find zoffix's z useful to build and test everything

[07:11] <jmerelo> tyil: although probably you have that (or something similar) already.

[07:12] *** graphene joined
[07:12] <tyil> not yet, but if I go into actually trying to fix it, I'll probably write up scripts to automate all the annoying parts before my first PR :p

[09:26] <lizmat> argh... the messed up the markdown -> HTML conversion

[09:27] <tyil> I just wanted to say

[09:27] <tyil> that looks like she tried to bolden it

[09:27] <El_Che> it's tricky when the formatting is done with special chars that p6 also uses

[09:29] <lizmat> the thing is that on GitHub, the markdown rendered the sigils as bold inside that table

[09:30] <tyil> GitHub has its own flavour of markdown

[09:30] <tyil> maybe that can explain some of the differences

[10:15] <cognominal-p6> A sequitur about my question yesterday. What will be the point to use str in place of Str, which caused my problem in the first place, if eventually the optimizer will be capable optimize out the OO rigmarole when possible. 

[10:16] *** Ipsilon16 left
[10:16] <tyil> because eventually is not right now would be my first guess

[10:18] <cognominal-p6> I would agree with that. So my use of str was premature optimization

[10:19] *** psychoslave joined
[10:19] <jnthn> Primarily it's there for bootstrapping reasons, but also a `my str @arr` can be rather more compact in memory

[10:19] <jnthn> There's not much reason to use it on a scalar

[10:52] <timotimo> well, you can use methods on $s if it's "str", but it'll be boxed to a Str on the spot for you

[10:52] <timotimo> and that Str object will immediately become garbage

[10:52] *** pmurias left

[12:43] <Zoffix> Ah

[12:43] <timotimo> though with a little branch i've got in moarvm, the information goes into the spesh log, too

[12:44] * Zoffix giggles at "BAIL: op <setmethcache>"

[12:44] <Zoffix> .oO( is there a setcocainecache op? )

[12:46] <cognominal-p6> Is Walter White in the core team ?

[12:47] *** nemesit|znc27 left
[12:47] <Zoffix> BAIL: op <setmethcache>

[12:47] <Zoffix> Constructing JIT graph (cuuid: 83, name: '!cursor_start')

[12:48] <Zoffix> timotimo: these two lines are one after the other. Does it mean !cursor_start was not made green because of setmethcache op?

[12:48] <timotimo> no, to find out what was bailed you have to look upwards for a "Constructing JIT graph" line

[12:48] <timotimo> potentially an "Entering inline"

[12:48] <timotimo> oh, the spesh log *does* have info about bailed jits

[12:48] <El_Che> the number of times I get an error for using ~ instead of . 

[12:49] <timotimo> "JIT was not successful"

[12:50] <Zoffix> El_Che: you should write less Perl 5 :)

[12:51] <timotimo> are perl5's error messages as good as perl6's when you write the other perl by accident?

[12:51] <Zoffix> no

[12:51] <Zoffix> $ perl -wlE 'say "foo" ~ "bar"'

[12:51] <Zoffix> syntax error at -e line 1, near ""foo" ~"

[12:51] <Zoffix> Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.

[12:51] <timotimo> i wonder if a module could be written for that

[12:52] <Zoffix> timotimo: what should I be looking for anyway?

[12:52] <Zoffix> in the log

[12:53] <Zoffix> JIT was not successful and compilation took 4us

[12:53] <Zoffix> Latest guard tree for '!cursor_init' (cuid: 80, file: gen/moar/stage2/QRegex.nqp:1415)

[12:53] <Zoffix> Is that it?

[12:53] <timotimo> that comes at the very end of a compile piece

[12:53] <timotimo> so it corresponds to what comes before it

[12:53] <Zoffix> ok

[12:53] <timotimo> is the routine red or yellow in the profile?

[12:54] <Zoffix> red

[12:54] <Zoffix> MVM_SPESH_LOG=log.log ./nqp --profile --profile-filename=out.html -e 'my int $x; while $x++ < 100_000 { "foo" ~~ /:i FOO/ }'

[12:54] <Zoffix> That's what I'm profiling and I wanna know why !cursor_init is red

[12:54] <timotimo> can you check if the spesh log ends in about a gazillion "planned nothing" bits?

[12:54] <timotimo> ah, probably not that then

[12:54] <Zoffix> Well, I wanna know how to know why a thing is red, in general

[12:55] <Zoffix> no, I don't see any planned nothings at the end

[12:55] <timotimo> i'll have a look-see myself. it's usually easy to see why something is yellow instead of red, but it's hard to find out why something is completely red

[12:55] <Zoffix> Ah

[12:57] <timotimo> param_on_o makes cursor_init bail fwiw

[12:57] <Zoffix> What does that op do?

[12:58] <timotimo> gets an optional named parameter as an object

[12:58] <Zoffix> ah

[12:58] <timotimo> it's the p argument

[13:23] <Zoffix> It's just a ton of annoying typing is all.

[13:23] <jnthn> No, it takes which profiler to use

[13:24] <jnthn> Hmm, I always just let it pick the filename for me :)

[13:24] <Zoffix> but then you run it again and you have to open again, rather than just hittin F5 in browser :)

[13:24] <jnthn> That way I never accidentally overwrite a previous profile I might want to compare against later :)

[13:24] <jnthn> I figure your memory is better than mine :-)

[13:25] <Zoffix> nah, I just re-open if I want to keep old profile (in a separate tab) or refresh I want to discard :)

[13:25] <jnthn> Anyway, not really opposed, if it's more convenient for many folks :)

[13:26] <jnthn> Though probably need to continue recognizing --profile-filename= for a while

[16:01] <Nik_> Hi there

[16:01] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v graphene

[16:01] <Nik_> Can you please guide me with few answers?

[16:01] <timotimo> we can certainly try

[16:02] <Nik_> Ok thanks..first I wanna know can we make frozen binaries for win & linux

[16:03] <timotimo> not quite; you can use WiX to create an installer for windows that will put a perl6 + your program into a fixed directory, and you can ship your application as a docker image easily

[16:04] <Nik_> Ok..

[16:04] <Nik_> Which is the most stable module to build GUI apps .

[16:05] <jmerelo> Nik_: you can use this perl6 image as base for your Docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/alpine-perl6/. There are others, of course. I don't know of any for Win, though

[16:05] <timotimo> windows also has docker

[16:05] <timotimo> i have really only tried GTK so far

[16:06] <Nik_> Yeah.. I m quite familiar with docker

[16:06] <jmerelo> timotimo: of course, but I don't know if there's a base image for that. Win needs different images and binaries.

[16:06] <timotimo> oh, it does?

[16:06] <timotimo> i did not know *that*

[16:07] <jmerelo> Nik_: there are a few in the ecosystem https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=GUI but just the last one looks like it really builds GUIs. timotimo is right, only GTK is known

[16:07] *** Ven` left
[16:07] <Nik_> What about perlQT?

[16:07] <timotimo> oh, GTK::Simple ought to have a GUI tag on it

[16:07] <jmerelo> timotimo: right. Docker isolates, does not virtualize. It needs the hosts's kernel. You can only ship images to those with the same kernel. Linuxes to linuxes (and MacOSx, but that's another story)

[16:07] <timotimo> well, you can use Inline::Perl5 to get at PerlQT, and you can use Inline::Python to get at PySide and PyQt

[16:08] <jmerelo> timotimo: originally, Windows was running a Linux VM with the docker daemon in it, and images were compatible. Now they have ported containerd to Windows, and it needs its own containers.

[16:08] <timotimo> that's probably for the better

[16:08] <jmerelo> OSX still does the Linux VM under the hood, far as I know.

[16:08] <timotimo> and surely there's a docker container somewhere that has a linux vm inside it for doing it the old way

[16:09] <jmerelo> timotimo: you can certainly test both to see which one works better...

[16:09] *** scimon left
[16:09] *** Guest18 left
[16:10] <timotimo> if you have extremely specific needs for the GUI, maybe SDL2::Raw is something to try ...

[16:10] <jmerelo> timotimo: you look at the Docker store now, it says which architecture (for the binary format) and OS (for the kernel) it's using. For instance, mysql https://store.docker.com/images/mysql-enterprise-server

[16:10] <timotimo> you mean the "linux" and "x86-64" tags below the short description?

[16:11] <jmerelo> timotimo: right. Here, Python, for instance, has a pull down with different OSs, including "IBM Z" https://store.docker.com/images/python

[16:12] <jmerelo> timotimo: the "official" docker image for Perl 6 lists only Linux https://store.docker.com/images/rakudo-star

[16:12] <timotimo> nobody has been fired for ordering ibm; why don't we have that? :)

[16:12] <jmerelo> (my image is extraofficial)

[16:12] <jmerelo> timotimo: I might have access to IBM Z under the academic initiative... I'll have to check it out. 

[16:13] <jmerelo> timotimo: and Python has it. Why don't we?

[16:30] <jmerelo> timotimo: don't know that very well. I don't know if they can be downloaded afterwards... 

[16:31] <timotimo> appveyor can at least store artifacts i believe?

[16:31] <jmerelo> timotimo: in principle, it should be possible to build a Windows image using the base image and whatever you want to use, the msi or whatever.

[16:32] <jmerelo> timotimo: as said above, that might be the case, but I don't really know. I mean, hub.docker.com builds Docker images for you, but I don't know if it does that for Windows

[16:32] <timotimo> https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-windows-docker-ci-appveyor/ - i just skimmed it but there's a diagram showing appveyor doing a "docker push" to docker hub

[16:32] <jmerelo> timotimo: let's just say I don't know sh*t about Windows and let's leave it at that.

[16:33] <timotimo> that's fair

[16:37] * jmerelo Windows free since the Spanish IRS changed the tax preparation program to a JVM based one.

[16:37] <timotimo> nice

[16:56] <koto> ufobat___, not yet(guide/doc), I believe. We do have plans for reverse proxy support for next release with support of http1.1 and http2, but it is still work in progress. However, I am talking about a Cro server's ability to work/describe reverse proxy thing. When something other routes requests to host/port, it should Just Work I think, including http/2.

[17:00] <ufobat___> Koto really? it does, i thouoght when you have a reverse proxy the tls will be terminated at the reverse proxy side, not at the cro side, and for http2 you need alpn, no?

[17:00] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v n0m4d1c

[17:03] <koto> ufobat___, I am not sure how reverse proxy you plan to use handles tls. As for alpn, we do support it... When it comes to direct request. This is where I am not too sure. Do you want some specific http/2 features like server push?

[21:02] <Demos[m]> OK next question: can I somehow indicate that I want a method defined as a sub as well?

[21:03] <lizmat> no

[21:03] <lizmat> but you *can* use a sub as a method

[21:04] <lizmat> m: sub foo($a) { dd $a }; 42.&foo

[21:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 06dfbf027: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[21:04] <Demos[m]> with a "."?

[21:04] <lizmat> .&foo in the example

[21:05] <lizmat> called on an Int object that contains 42

[21:05] <Demos[m]> can I leave out the "&"

[21:06] <lizmat> no, that indicates it should do a "sub" lookup

[21:06] <lizmat> m: sub foo($a) { dd $a }; 42.foo

[21:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 06dfbf027: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'foo' for invocant of type 'Int'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[21:20] <tobs> or using the magical :; statement separator

[21:20] <geekosaur> its not magical. ":" is like "," in a parameter list but indicates the invocant for a method

[21:20] <tobs> :-)

[21:21] <geekosaur> matters when there's other parameters

[21:22] <geekosaur> if you want $x.foo(3) in sub form it's foo($x: 3)
