[01:42] <k-man> i just got my copy of learning perl6

[01:43] <k-man> the example at the bottom of p8, is perhaps missing a ++ on the $count in: print $count, "\r";

[01:43] <k-man> i mean it works fine without it but seems pointless without a ++ in there somewhere

[11:18] <tyil> I have this in a signature: `IO::Path:D $target where *.f && *.extension eq "zip",`

[11:18] <tyil> when I Run the script, it warns Useless use of "eq" in expression ".extension eq \"zip\"" in sink context

[11:19] <tyil> but I want to ensure the extension is zip

[11:19] <squashable6> Webhook for lizmat/P5pack is now active! Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.

[11:20] <sena_kun> tyil, you probably want something like...

[11:20] <sena_kun> subset B of IO::Path:D where { .f && .extension eq "zip" }

[11:20] <tyil> I want to make subsets of it later, yes

[11:20] <sena_kun> ah, sorry, well, subset thing is unnecessary.

[11:20] <sena_kun> I just was lazy to type a sub

[11:20] <tyil> oh

[11:20] <tyil> the accolades

[11:20] <sena_kun> I mean, your `where` condition probably should have brackets

[11:21] <sena_kun> At least it does not gives a warning. :)

[11:21] <tyil> Malformed double closure;

[11:21] <sena_kun> hmm

[11:21] <tyil> `IO::Path:D $target where { *.f && *.extension eq "zip" }`

[11:22] <tyil> I could use $_ isntead of *, but those are slower 

[11:22] <sena_kun> hmm, it is broken in sub case for me too.

[11:22] <tyil> it does seem to work as expected, apart from the warning that the `eq` is apparently useless

[11:23] <sena_kun> then can't help, sorry. :/

[11:50] <timotimo> because it evaluates the rhs of … for every value to see if it should be kept

[11:50] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yes, but, there are two `*`, right?

[11:51] <timotimo> yeah

[11:51] <AlexDaniel> and both of them represent the same value?

[11:51] <timotimo> i assume it'll pass the same value for each

[11:51] <timotimo> like it does with postcircumfix:<[ ]>

[11:52] <AlexDaniel> so the WhateverCode in question still has two parameters, but it passes the same value to both?

[11:53] <timotimo> yeah, that's what i suspect

[12:04] <tbrowder__> hi, #perl6

[12:06] <tyil> hi tbrowder__ :D

[12:06] <lizmat> hmmm... looks like none of the CX:: classes are documented :-(

[12:06] <tbrowder__> grammar question: when one declares a :my var on a token, does that var and its value stay with a match?

[12:06] <tbrowder__> tyil: hi, getting close to pod data blocks

[12:07] <tyil> :D

[12:07] <tyil> nice

[12:08] <tbrowder__> i should say closer, still lots of build cycles ahead

[12:10] <tyil> I'm not in a hurry

[12:10] <tyil> I have plenty other things to do lately 

[12:10] <jnthn> tbrowder__: No, the variable is just a normal lexical variable (or dynamic if `:my $*foo = ...`)

[12:10] <timotimo> tbrowder__: it's a lexically scoped variable, so it doesn't

[12:10] <jnthn> Not associated with the Match object in any way

[12:11] <timotimo> jnthn: dynamic vars defined inside a regex like that won't survive into the action method, right?

[12:11] <jnthn> Yes, they will :)

[12:12] <timotimo> nice

[12:12] <jnthn> Because the action method is called from the regex

[12:12] <timotimo> very good

[12:12] <tobs`> I'd like to start a Proc::Async and ideally return a Supply which transforms its stdout. I can't see how I can simultaneously arrange for an exception to be thrown in case the program dies instead of producing output.

[12:13] <tobs`> https://hastebin.com/pawitaboge.pl is a start

[12:13] <timotimo> tobs`: sounds like you want a supply block, or do you want to suck up all output until it's finished and only then decide whether to emit the data or throw an exception?

[12:13] <tbrowder__> on

[12:14] <jnthn> Yes, supply block, and then you can die in there and it'll propagate the exception to the subscriber of the supply you produce

[12:14] <tobs`> timotimo: I very much don't want to wait

[12:14] <tbrowder__> while on grammars, in rakudo nqp, can we use make just as in p6 land?

[12:15] <tobs`> ahh, very nice! Thank you

[12:15] *** ChoHag left
[12:17] <tbrowder__> i need easy access to a match value later for a test, and i would like to ensure it has a zero value even though it was not matched

[12:18] <tbrowder__> that probably doesn’t make sense.,.

[12:19] <tbrowder__> i’m trying to get info out of a pod_configuration match. the key/value pairs, if they exist.

[12:20] <tbrowder__> i’ve been able to, in some cases but not all, rely on stringification, but that seems to be blind luck

[12:28] <tbrowder__> in rakudo nqp if i create some dynamic grammar vars to hold special values for use during object construction, is that an ok practice?

[12:30] <timotimo> sure

[19:37] <masak> could I ask the friendly experts here about a crazy macro use whose semantics I'm not 100% sure of?

[19:38] <masak> (...as if you have any choice in the matter...) ;)

[19:38] <masak> my $q; macro m1($ast) { $q = $ast; return Nil }; macro m2() { return $q }; for 1, 2, 3 -> $v { m1($v) }; for 4, 5, 6 -> $v { m2() }

[19:38] <masak> what should the above print?

[19:38] <masak> er, make that `say(m2())`, so that it prints something

[19:39] <AlexDaniel> what's the meaning of `return` there?

[19:39] *** dmaestro_ left
[19:40] <masak> well, a macro returns some AST (a Qtree) back to the compiler so it can re-inject it into the code, "expanding" the macro call into the returned AST

[19:41] <masak> though it's, conjectural, `return Nil` is taken to mean "there's no code to be injected here" -- an empty statement, or whatever

[19:45] <masak> I mean, on a purely textual level, `m2()` is expanded to `$v`

[19:46] <masak> but (importantly) it's not "the `$v`" from the `4, 5, 6` loop; it's the one from the `1, 2, 3` loop

[19:47] <masak> at least if macro expansion is hygienic

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> as in “wtf, where did you find that?”

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> why?

[19:59] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Praise

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> so what is $ast? I was thinking it's just a var with a name, which in case of the second loop will point at 4 5 6

[20:00] <AlexDaniel> and if $v wasn't there… I don't know, an error of some kind…

[20:00] <masak> I wish I had an excellent, final answer to that. but it's a very good question.

[20:00] <AlexDaniel> but yeah, you're asking a wrong person :)

[20:00] *** Kaiepi left

[20:12] <El_Che> I think there are some perl6 repos using submodules

[20:12] <jnthn> masak: How so?

[20:12] <El_Che> I wonder if star is built like that

[20:14] <masak> jnthn: the `$v` in the first loop does not originate from a quasi, but from mainline code. it's handled at compile time, long before it has the value 3, long before the *frame* where it has the value 3 exists

[20:15] <masak> jnthn: best I can think of is if the fixup mechanism could be bent to handle this case

[20:15] <jnthn> masak: But the "direct trick" is only about quasi, and there ain't one here?

[20:15] <masak> this is not a case where the "direct trick" can be applied

[20:15] <masak> because there isn't a runtime scope to lookup directly into

[20:15] <jnthn> I don't see what there is to apply. :)

[20:16] *** scotticles left
[20:16] <masak> those only happen inside macros, but $v is outside a macro, in the mainline code

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> though I haven't yet figured out how they got code execution from that

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> most programs don't have “ok I'll execute your argument as code” behavior :)

[20:41] <timotimo> it sounded like it just assembles a line to pass to the shell

[21:02] <geekosaur> yeh, I read this as running subsidiary git commands to do checkouts

[21:03] <geekosaur> and my question would be why they're dragging the shell into it, unless there's some compatibility gotcha with respect to e.g. windows

[21:48] <jnthn> They are named arguments

[21:57] <cheese__> Hi, I was reading the logs and saw this mentioned '1…*.say×*>10'. FWIW I found there are two values passed, so it is the same as '1… -> $a, $b { ($a.say * $b) > 10 }'. Cool example!

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: ah, two last values?

[22:00] <cheese__> yeah, first iteration it is 1, 2

[22:00] <cheese__> then 2, 3

[22:00] <cheese__> etc.

[22:00] <cheese__> that's why it is *>10

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> that makes sense!

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> but I didn't know you can use that on the right side of …

[22:01] <cheese__> me neither, the --target=ast option is really cool, didnt know that either :D

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: thanks!

[22:01] <cheese__> your welcome, i have to thank you for all the stuff!

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> ahhhh, so that's how they do Fibonacci in 17 characters

[22:07] <Demos[m]> in "sub f(|c){};" is C a sigilless parameter?

[22:07] <Demos[m]> if I write sub f(|) {} do I get *%_ as the slurp?

[22:08] *** itaipu left
[22:08] <Demos[m]> serrr slip

[22:08] <jnthn> | produces a capture containing all the positional and named arguments

[22:09] <jnthn> \p would be a normal sigilless parameter (same as the my \foo = ... syntax)

[22:09] <geekosaur> it's more or less requesting that |c contain all the parameters in as raw a form as possible

[22:09] <Demos[m]> right but what is "c"

[22:10] <geekosaur> so it turns off the slurpy stuff, named parameters, etc.

[22:10] <geekosaur> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Capture

[22:10] <Demos[m]> oh so c is just a sigiless parameter then

[22:11] <jnthn> Well, syntax wise, yes

[22:11] <geekosaur> not quite "just". it's sigilless, btu its contents wil be different from sub f(\c)

[22:11] <jnthn> In the sense that it gives you a term

[22:11] <Demos[m]> right

[22:12] <Demos[m]> but the identifier "c" is a sigilless variable

[22:14] <jnthn> Yes (except I don't really like calling them variables, because they are immutable :))

[22:30] <AlexDaniel> if Foo::Bar exports some subs, how can I make it so that whenever Foo is used it will import stuff from Foo::Bar also? In other words so that I can just do `use Foo` instead of `use Foo; use Foo::Bar`?

[22:34] <cheese__> I think the example at https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#UNIT::EXPORT::* is quite good.

[22:34] *** Sgeo_ joined
[22:35] *** Sgeo left
[22:35] *** Ven`` joined
[22:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Sgeo_

[22:35] <cheese__> So you could do it manually with my package EXPORT::DEFAULT { OUR::{'something'} := some_sub }

[22:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven``

[22:36] *** Ven`` left
[22:38] <AlexDaniel> I think this works: OUR::<&foo> := &foo;

[22:40] <cheese__> And I just read there is also the EXPORT sub, which is even simpler, because you should be able to delegate to the other module's EXPORT sub

[22:40] <AlexDaniel> ooooooooooooooh

[22:40] <cheese__> like EXPORT { %(Foo::Bar.EXPORT) }

[22:41] <cheese__> not sure if that works

[22:44] <jnthn> Also, there's been speculated a `use Foo:reexport` or something

[22:45] <thundergnat> <timotimo> "i wonder what page of the docs the "say map *.Str.chars" comes from..." I believe that would be:  https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/doc/Type/List.pod6#L236

[22:45] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: I can't figure out how to use that though

[22:45] <cheese__> I am trying something rn

[22:46] <cheese__> I will try it like this, but with blocks: unit module Foo::Bar; sub bar is export { "bar" }; unit module Foo; use Foo::Bar; sub foo is export { "foo" }; sub EXPORT { %(Foo::Bar::EXPORT::DEFAULT) }; unit module main; say foo(); say bar()

[22:51] <cheese__> AlexDaniel, I need another try with real files, or do you know how to use an inline-module?

[22:51] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: you can use github gists, will that work for you?

[22:52] <Demos[m]> is there a way to just get all the args that were passed to a method, I want to write a multimethod that has a signature but then passes all it's args along to somebody else

[22:52] <cheese__> AlexDaniel: oh cool, that could work

[22:52] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: it'd need `use lib ‘sandbox/’` in the main file, but other than that should work out of the box. evalable6 is the bot to do that

[23:08] <AlexDaniel> kbloom: is that what you are looking for, or am I misunderstanding it?

[23:09] <cheese__> AlexDaniel: got it, you need to have EXPORT outside of the unit

[23:13] <cheese__> hm.. what is going on? :D

[23:15] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: use lib ‘sandbox/’; and also rename .pm to .pm6

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> without a slash should work too

[23:16] <thebooort> Hey there! I am trying to make a perl6 tutorial about how to integrate/solve and plot differential equations with Perl6 as I did not find anysimilar in the documentation file. I have found that with rungekuta+mathmodel modules it is quite easy to generate that kind of numerical experiment and as an applied mathematician I decided to do the examples based on populations dynamics models. 

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> cheese__: you had a typo: 'sandbox'/ instead of 'sandbox/'

[23:16] <thebooort> I still have to do some changes and correct some typos, but I would like to hear your opinions! https://github.com/thebooort/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/simulating-growth-models-with-perl6.pod6

[23:16] <cheese__> yeah bit it failed again because of .pm6 I guess

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> kbloom: did I answer your question? :)

[23:16] <cheese__> biut why did it work the second time for you?

[23:17] <cheese__> ah sorry, I see now. Different gist

[23:18] <AlexDaniel> thebooort: nitpick: “Requeriments” typo (you probably want to run the whole file through a spell checker)

[23:20] <AlexDaniel> moritz: I see formulas! Somehow it makes me want to ping you? Anyway, see ↑

[23:20] <MasterDuke> thebooort: another nitpick, we usually say "Perl 6", with a non-breaking space between "Perl" and "6"

[23:21] <thebooort> yes! there are a lot of typos :lol: thank you for the corrections!  It is okay then to continue writing the tutorial? 

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> thebooort: you want that to be part of the docs, right?

[23:22] <thebooort> Yes, I would like to when i finish it (if possible of course)

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> .tell jmerelo http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-05#l1076

[23:23] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> moritz: also, what do you think, does it look like perl6/doc material?

[23:25] <kbloom> AlexDaniel: thanks, that's exactly what i meant

[23:25] <kbloom> perl 6 is amazing :)
