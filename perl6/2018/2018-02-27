[19:58] <TimToady> huh, I think our dwimmery is just a bit off there

[19:59] <timotimo> can we do this right without resorting to backtracking?

[20:01] <moritz> no

[20:01] <moritz> well, maybe with copious amounts of look-aheads

[20:02] <TimToady> it's already failing when it can't find the '>'

[20:02] <timotimo> no need to two-pass parse if you're parsing two alternatives at the same time ...

[20:02] <TimToady> we just need to throw a '='? in there and include it in the message, or so

[20:02] <timotimo> oh, *that* is what you're refering to

[20:03] <TimToady> yes, it currently checks what follows the < to see if it looks like a likely comparison term

[20:03] <TimToady> <?before \h* [ \d | <.sigil> | ':' ] >

[20:05] <TimToady> I mean, we could just add '=' to that list, but then it would misleadingly claim that an intended <= is really a < operator

[20:05] <timotimo> don't forget about <==, too

[20:05] <timotimo> and also <<==

[20:06] <TimToady> well, those are much less likely to have spaces omitted around them, and also much less likely to have a sigil or number after them

[20:07] <TimToady> so I doubt the heuristic would be useful in those cases very often

[20:07] *** Kaiepi left
[20:07] <TimToady> and the main problem is people coming from other languages where they're used to getting away with no spaces around < or <=

[20:08] *** Kaiepi joined

[20:19] <moritz> the main problem is that we overload characters to mean too many different things :-)

[23:08] <thowe> Hi.  I just discovered there is a thing called zef.  I tried to install zef using "rakudobre build zef".  It failed in testing.  Is this a known issue or am I broken all by my lonesome?

[23:20] <timotimo> thowe: can you give us your perl6 --version?

[23:20] <thowe> This is Rakudo version 2016.10-21-g697a0ae built on MoarVM version 2016.10-15-g715e39a

[23:20] <thowe> implementing Perl 6.c.

[23:21] <thowe> hm, I need d don't I?  Why doesn't running rakudo build moar do this?

[23:21] <thowe> er rakudobrew build moar

[23:22] <thowe> I probably just don't know how to use rakudobrew

[23:23] <MasterDuke> huggable: debs

[23:23] <huggable> MasterDuke, CentOS, Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu Rakudo packages: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases

[23:23] <MasterDuke> thowe: ^^^ might be an option for you

[23:23] <thowe> I think I just told rakudobrew to use a newer branch maybe...

[23:24] <thowe> 2018.2.1 or somesuch

[23:26] <timotimo> thowe: that was probably the date when we switched from using "nom" as the default branch to "master"

[23:27] <timotimo> hm, no, that was 2017.10?

[23:27] <thowe> This looks like it is building something newer maybe.

[23:33] <thowe> hm.  It says it has built moar-2018.02.1.  I switch to moar-2018.02.1 and it says "Switching to moar-2018.02.1" and then I run perl6 --version and it still says that it is implementing 6.c

[23:33] <thowe> do I need to switch to moar-master?

[23:34] <thowe> hm, that also says 6.c    how do I build/switch 6.d ?

[23:35] <MasterDuke> there is no 6.d yet

[23:35] *** kurahaupo_ joined
[23:35] <thowe> oh.

[23:35] <MasterDuke> but you can 'use v6.d.PREVIEW' in your script

[23:35] <thowe> It looks like zef may be progressing now :)
