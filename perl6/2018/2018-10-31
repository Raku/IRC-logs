[01:25] <MasterDuke> .ask xinming what code were you running to create the heap snapshot that caused the unbox error?

[01:25] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to xinming.

[01:25] <timotimo> i have the feeling that the heap snapshot code - either the part that writes or the part that reads - is subtly wrong

[01:28] <MasterDuke> i just tried with a 434mb heap snapshot, didn't have any problems

[01:30] <timotimo> try exploring one of the snapshots a bit

[01:31] <MasterDuke> i did, no problems

[01:31] <timotimo> get the top objects, find 1000 objects of a given type, "show" one of the objects near the end, follow some references

[01:31] <timotimo> i sometimes run into indices out of range for the amount of collectables there should be

[01:31] <timotimo> also, objects with a type of ""

[01:32] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[01:32] <MasterDuke> yeah, there are a couple with a type of ""

[01:32] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[01:33] <timotimo> i don't really know what these are :|

[01:35] <MasterDuke> no problems so far

[01:38] <timotimo> weird.

[01:39] <timotimo> "amount of memory freed" is a very high number, and in base 16 it looks like 1FFFE6800

[01:39] <timotimo> [ "hmm" face intensifies ]

[01:39] <MasterDuke> what gives "amount of memory freed"?

[01:40] <timotimo> that's the other profiler :)

[01:40] <MasterDuke> oh, ha

[01:42] <ryn1x> m: "abc".split("")

[01:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: ( no output )

[01:42] <ryn1x> m: say "abc".split("")

[01:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: OUTPUT: «( a b c )␤»

[01:42] <timotimo> m: say "abc".comb

[01:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: OUTPUT: «(a b c)␤»

[01:43] <MasterDuke> timotimo: profiling the heap analyzer?

[01:43] <timotimo> no :)

[01:44] <ryn1x> I am using comb to do this, but what is the design choice behind putting the blanks at the beginning and end with split?

[01:44] <timotimo> this:

[01:44] <timotimo> m: say "AhAeAlAlAoA".split("A").perl

[01:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: OUTPUT: «("", "h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "").Seq␤»

[01:45] <timotimo> there's a "" at the beginning of the string, so you get what's before the "" as the first entry

[01:45] <timotimo> if you prefer it to be stripped for you, there's a flag for that, too

[01:47] <ryn1x> m: say "hAAAeAAAlAAAlAAAo".split("A")

[01:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 266af373d: OUTPUT: «(h   e   l   l   o)␤»

[01:48] <ryn1x> i see... keeps the original indices.

[10:24] <Xliff> :)

[10:25] <Xliff> moritz: I am getting a segfault out of latest rakudo. What's the best way to insure I get a decent backtrace? 

[10:25] <Xliff> Currently I have nothing when I run perl6-gdb-m

[10:25] <Xliff> Oh, that's new... 

[10:25] <Xliff> Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)

[10:26] <moritz> perl6-gdb-m is usually the right too

[10:26] <moritz> you might need to try a few times

[10:26] <Xliff> Yes, but I don't have any tc indicator, so no MVM_backtrace

[10:27] <moritz> you can also try with various environment variable to see if you can find out which subsystem triggers it

[10:27] <moritz> MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1  MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 etc.

[10:36] <masak> is all that documented somewhere? I find I forget between the occasions I need it...

[10:40] <Xliff> .... And now I can't trigger it nymore

[10:40] <Xliff> s/nymore/anymore/

[10:40] <Xliff> I do have code in an old commit that should work. I will check it out and see after I get some rest.

[16:42] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder___: by any chance is it possible that you did `git push --force` in the last few days in rakudo master branch?

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder___: it's not the end of the world, but things break when that happens

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder___: I'm currently trying to figure out why whateverable and camelia ended up with broken repos

[16:44] <AlexDaniel> it seems like those who don't `git pull` very often didn't notice it

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6-dev?date=2018-10-28#l342

[16:51] <AlexDaniel> yeah, looks like accidental `git push --force`

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> OK, I am disabling force pushes for master everywhere

[16:52] <moritz> +1

[16:53] <[Coke]> we should protect master against force if we haven't already

[16:53] <[Coke]> ... and I just caught up.

[16:53] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel++

[16:53] <AlexDaniel> yeah I'm surprised that it's not there yet

[16:53] <[Coke]> how does one *accidentally* git force? 

[16:53] <moritz> I wanted to do that years ago, but back then, github didn't suppor that

[16:53] <AlexDaniel> now it does

[16:54] <moritz> GitHub++ # catching up with GitLab in that regard

[16:54] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[16:54] <AlexDaniel> OK done for nqp, rakudo and doc

[16:54] <AlexDaniel> MoarVM already had it

[16:55] <moritz> AlexDaniel++

[16:56] <[Coke]> Guess we need to add that to the "welcome to the repo" talk.

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: I can tell you one way I almost did it once (ctrl+c-ed in time though)

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: so I never type command, I use ctrl+r

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> so for me git push is usually “ctrl+r pus” or something like that

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> now, you sometimes have forks and stuff, and sometime you do --push

[16:57] <[Coke]> my 2¢ - if you are working on something "private" (in the past, I've done with branches named coke/whatever), then you can do whatever you want, but anything possibly shared (not just master), don't ever force.

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> but that makes it the last command, so next time I want to do a non-force push I may accidentally use the last command in history…

[18:16] <tbrowder___> AlexDaniel: i could have accidentally pushed to upstream, but if i did i surely wouldn’t have tried to force it. my habit is to pull from upstream and push to my fork for a PR, but i did at least one web edit on master recently.

[18:16] <yoleaux> 16:52Z <[Coke]> tbrowder___: https://perlconference.us/tpc-2019-pit/

[18:17] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder___: it's all fine

[18:17] <AlexDaniel> now master branch is protected so nobody will be able to force push :)

[18:17] <timotimo> and if there has been a catastrophe, admins can still revert it temporarily

[18:17] <AlexDaniel> the fact that it wasn't protected was the biggest mistake in this

[18:18] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: uh not sure how that would go

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> you'd need to recover the commits that were force pushed into nonexistence 

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> then merge these two diverging branches

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> then commit?

[18:19] <timotimo> nah, just turn it off, force-push, turn it back on

[18:20] <AlexDaniel> ? I don't get it…

[18:20] <timotimo> if there is a catastrophe that requires us to force-push

[18:20] <AlexDaniel> like what?

[18:21] <timotimo> like pushing a commit that deletes all files or something

[18:21] <tbrowder___> ok, thanks. i am trying to merge my old branch work with a new branch off master, and i am having build tool problems. but i have a bad git connection. anyone else having build issues?

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: that is fixed with a revert, not force push

[18:21] <timotimo> that's fair i guess

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> a force push can be needed like if, uh… someone pushed CP to master, or something like that…

[21:57] <Xliff> Problem is... it takes 12 minutes to compile some of it.

[21:58] <Xliff> Actually, correction. You MIGHT be able to get away with less with a simple modification, but I don't know if that will reproduce the problem, properly.

[22:04] <notable6> moritz, Noted!

[22:05] *** [Sno] joined
[22:05] <moritz> so, I've had a crazy idea

[22:05] <timotimo> dogbert has pinpointed a spesh commit i made recently

[22:05] <moritz> it seems that writing Perl 6 books the traditional route doesn't make a lot of money

[22:05] <timotimo> fortunately i put it in after the release

[22:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v [Sno]

[22:06] <moritz> but when I started with "Perl 6 by Example" on leanpub, it seemed to sell decently-ish

[22:06] <moritz> (with leanpub taking only 15% or so of the buying price)

[22:06] *** sno left
[22:07] <moritz> so, what if I wrote a Perl 6 book on leanpub, and set an income goal

[22:07] <moritz> and when that goal is met, the book is open-sourced, and could for example be integrated into the official docs website

[22:08] <SqrtNegInf> That's my gist, and I was going to open an issue with a simplified code snippet

[22:08] <moritz> so I might make some income (which is always a good motivation), and eventually, everyone profits from high-quality material in the docs

[22:09] <SqrtNegInf> In my case, avoiding the bug requires MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1

[22:19] <tobs> moritz: I've never heard of leanpub. What they say about royalty rates sounds nice, but how would "income goal" work exactly? As in, you write it for k months and as soon as it was sold often enough to generate k*monthly-income, it is open-sourced?

[23:08] <rouking> Hey folks, I'm writing a grammar whose TOP token is { <line>+ % \n }, and it only seems to match one line

[23:08] <rouking> (using Grammar::Tracer to see what it's doing, since the result was not what I wanted)

[23:12] <rouking> Here is the whole file: http://ix.io/1qzZ

[23:13] <rouking> Looks like the line rule is somehow matching more than a single line

[23:13] <rouking> Wait, is vertical space included in \s?

[23:15] <rouking> But changing that to \h causes the whole line not to match for some reason...

[23:17] *** HaraldJoerg left
[23:17] <rouking> Aha, I mistyped. Now the line rule is working, but TOP is only ever matching a single line

[23:21] <jnthn> rouking: You probably want %% so that it's good with a trailing \n too at the end of the file, but that probably doesn't fully explain the problem

[23:24] <rouking> Oh right, that's true--but you're also right that it doesn't explain the current issue

[23:26] <rouking> This is the file it's drawing from: http://ix.io/1qA3
