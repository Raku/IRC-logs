[00:01] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: I did see it.  No worries.

[00:02] <woolfy> I just thought of a nice metaphore.  We are a group of 20 friends and we have decided we all go on a nice trip together.  All of us.  Six of us tell the others "we hate the beach, we will not go to the beach, whatever else is fine".

[00:03] <woolfy> Discussions go on and on and on.  Planning a trip is a lot of work, lots of discussions.  Museum, zoo, old city center, planetarium, geochache hunting, countryside, harbour, sea trip, ballooning, skydiving, etc.

[00:03] <tony-o> in this case, it is another drag and drop .dmg 

[00:03] <woolfy> At the end, a small minority decides for the beach.

[00:04] <woolfy> At the end, 14 people go to the beach.  Six friends do not join.  Some of them, because they cannot stay too long in the sun, others because they hate the sand.  Whatever.  They just do not join in.

[00:05] <woolfy> Zoffix took me to the beach.  I hate the beach.  I really do hate sunbathing.  A lake would have been fine.  This was lake Rakudo.  He took me to Beach Raku.  I am very unhappy and I will not join in.

[00:07] <dduncan> I didn’t see most discussion, but are you saying that using “Rakudo” as an alias for Perl 6 would have been fine for you?

[00:19] <SmokeMachine> Wouldn’t be better if the 6 people had fought against the beach?

[00:22] <tony-o> they did

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> heh, reading “Raku” so many times in the last few days, I'm starting to love the name

[00:26] <tony-o> at least you're not pretending it's an alias

[00:26] <AlexDaniel> it's an alias

[00:26] <tony-o> sure

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> I mean that I love “Raku” as the word, which I didn't initially like

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> how did you get that I have no idea

[00:27] <AlexDaniel> but then, I guess my English is just not good enough to express what I mean

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> woolfy: I don't think it is accurate. More like some people wanted to swim and others wanted to sunbathe. We are all at the same beach, together. Swimming is now finally legal and safe (because interested parties have put their effort into it). Some people will not sunbathe at all and will only swim, others won't swim and will only sunbathe. There are people who will do both. In the end we will all have fun at the same party. Stop

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> flipping people who have fun in the water off just because it's not your thing.

[00:53] <AlexDaniel> After all, nobody is forcing you into the water. But yes, you will have to witness others swimming. How bad can it be?

[00:55] <tony-o> if they can't stay long in the sun then sitting on the beach while others swim is still painful

[00:57] <dduncan> Following this analogy, beach umbrellas are popular for people who can’t stay in the sun.

[00:57] <dduncan> But granted those people aren’t really having the fun participating either.

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> well, in my story they *want* to sunbathe. Just for some reason they want others to not have an opportunity to swim, at least not officially.

[00:58] <timotimo> perfect analogy. someone tells them "i can't go in the sun, so i can't go to the beach" and instead of believing they have a good reason, you say "oh just use an umbrella" and take them anyway :)

[00:58] <tony-o> that isn't an apt analogy, people don't want to rename perl6 - it's not that they don't want other people to call it rakudo or something

[00:58] <timotimo> also, swimming would have been fine in the lake, too

[00:58] <tony-o> timotimo: lol

[01:02] <Juerd> These beach analogies are amusing

[01:02] <Juerd> Keep them coming :)

[01:03] <Juerd> I don't understand any of them but at least it looks like a nice vacation

[01:04] <tony-o> the alias path is a thinly veiled shoe horn to a rename

[01:05] <AlexDaniel> I don't think these analogies are any useful. IMO the main problem right now is that people are overreacting

[01:05] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: how can it lead to a rename if “perl 6” as a name is so great?

[01:06] <timotimo> i think the overreaction was "larry wall says raku is the official alias name" becoming "we replace perl6 with raku everywhere we possibly can as fast as possible"

[01:06] <timotimo> where "as fast as possible" happens to overlap with "before larry has a chance to see what's going on and say something"

[01:06] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ok, where did that happen?

[01:06] <timotimo> that's my interpretation anyway

[01:06] <AlexDaniel> perl6 being replaced with raku I mean

[01:06] <tony-o> it's happening right now

[01:07] <timotimo> that's what the "synonym on stackoverflow" thing sounded like before it was explained

[01:07] <dduncan> I don’t think Perl 6 being actually renamed to Raku is a bad thing.  To me it looks the same as Apple using the name Swift for their next version of Objective C.

[01:07] <AlexDaniel> where? Somebody added an additional ｢raku｣ tag to stackoverflow questions that were tagged ｢perl6｣?

[01:07] <ingy> https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/376267/synonym-perl6-and-raku

[01:08] <AlexDaniel> stackoverflow synonyms is a technical problem (two different tags with the same meaning)

[01:08] <tony-o> timotimo: it doesn't help that the major proponent of the rename isn't exactly honest in his accounts with how the alias came to be

[01:08] <timotimo> dduncan: is swift really just a next version of objective c?

[01:08] <timotimo> isn't it kind of the opposite?

[01:08] <dduncan> That was always my understanding.

[01:08] <timotimo> isn't perl6 being called perl6 more like apple calling swift Objective C 2

[01:08] <dduncan> Exactly.

[01:08] <timotimo> tony-o: that reference does not resolve

[01:08] <tony-o> it would seem so

[01:09] <ingy> wait until p6 has to take on cache invalidation!

[01:09] <dduncan> I mean, using Raku instead of Perl for this new major version is like Apple using Swift instead of Objective C, and not calling it Objective C 2.

[01:09] <timotimo> to me at least

[01:10] <tony-o> impolite enough for this reaction: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-18#l6

[01:10] <tony-o> polite asking: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-11-05#l1558

[01:10] <ingy> anyone got a good stage name for YAML?

[01:10] <dduncan> JSON

[01:10] <tony-o> knowing that he's been asking for more than 2 months: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-08#l23

[01:12] <AlexDaniel> dduncan: you mean Perl *6*

[01:12] <tony-o> it's not a discussion if the major proponent is a memoryless system

[01:12] <AlexDaniel> or maybe not, I'm really not following anymore :)

[01:12] <tony-o> lol dduncan ingy 

[01:13] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: that first link is irrelevant. There was a lack of communication, we resolved it by communicating

[01:13] <tony-o> AlexDaniel: https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::XS#JSON-and-YAML

[01:14] <tony-o> AlexDaniel: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-18#l9 <- that would make it seem to be that nudging was in fact happening

[01:14] <dduncan> Re the YAML/JSON thing, I actualy invented a new one, called it MUON.  Fully specced, still have to make a parser/generator though.

[01:15] <tony-o> enough to irritate the side being nudged, which isn't irrelevant to me saying that zoffix wasn't politely asking

[01:15] <timotimo> what features does it have, dduncan?

[01:16] <ingy> dduncan: I'm already using MUON as a stage name for YAML

[01:16] <tony-o> timotimo: those links were meant for you ^ re:context why i think the recount of how the alias came to be isn't honest

[01:16] <tony-o> i have a postgres plugin that supports muon 

[01:16] <ingy> dduncan: I'll come up with a stage name for your MUON for you

[01:16] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: what happened: a blog post asking TimToady to make a decision was posted. TimToady did not respond in any way after a significant amount of time. Zoffix started to think that no progress is being done in that direction, but 6.d was approaching. So Zoffix started looking for alternative (less official solutions). TimToady responded that he is working on it. Zoffix stopped alternative efforts.

[01:17] <dduncan> timotimo: In a nutshell, MUON is analagous to JSON but more strongly typed; distinct syntax for maybe 2 dozen types.  Some Perl 6 design influence.  Includes specific support for representing source code as data also.

[01:17] <AlexDaniel> the initial blog post clearly asked for Nov 1st deadline, it was right there from the beginning, and TimToady seemed to be OK with that

[01:17] <ingy> dduncan: best of luck

[01:17] <tony-o> why exactly is zoffix imposing deadlines on LW ?

[01:18] *** HaraldJoerg left
[01:18] <ingy> dduncan: you should get Tom Werner Preston involved

[01:18] <dduncan> timotimo, ingy: https://github.com/muldis/Muldis_Object_Notation

[01:18] <dduncan> I consider the spec “done” but pull requests welcome.  Will have implementations soon.

[01:19] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: because Zoffix also works on marketing materials and 6.d related stuff, which is connected to the aliasing effort proposed in the blog post

[01:19] <dduncan> In one sense what NQP is to Perl 6, MUON is meant to be for some other langauges.

[01:19] <tony-o> the aliasing effort was created by the blog post

[01:19] <AlexDaniel> that's what I said, yes

[01:20] <dduncan> Relevant here because Perl 6 is a major influence on MUON etc.

[01:20] <tony-o> and so lw *must* respond to every blog post question or we fire for effect?

[01:20] <AlexDaniel> “I ask that Larry Wall renders his decision on the alias by November 1, 2018, so we would have the time to create proper informational materials for the 6.d language release, during which time, the name alias would be officially announced, if one is chosen.”

[01:20] <ingy> dduncan: I just started #muon for my yaml stage name

[01:21] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: Larry was free to reject the request, or ignore it, or anything

[01:21] <tony-o> don't ignore that his recount of "2 months of asking" is backed up by his claim that we've had over a year to discuss with him personally

[01:21] <tony-o> he didn't seem free to ignore it if the renaming was going to happen through other channels

[01:21] <AlexDaniel> it's not renaming

[01:21] <Juerd> yet

[01:21] <AlexDaniel> :S

[01:22] <tony-o> let's not play pretend

[01:22] <tony-o> and that ignores the point, that zoffix is imposing deadlines on lw by whatever means possible

[01:23] <AlexDaniel> it was a request, the deadline was part of the request

[01:23] <AlexDaniel> I see no problem with that

[01:23] <tony-o> and if he didn't respond to that request by 11/1 ?

[01:23] <tony-o> we'll set up a poll and then go with whatever name people vote on

[01:23] <Juerd> Many participants in these debates are assuming that the "stage name" will eventually overtake the "legal name". Nobody knows for sure, but there are proponents of the alias who want this to happen, and there are opponents who are afraid it will.

[01:23] <tony-o> the option 'wait for input from lw' wasn't there

[01:23] <AlexDaniel> then Zoffix and others would look for alternative solutions

[01:24] <tony-o> alternative solutions doesn't include 'wait for input'

[01:24] <AlexDaniel> tony-o: you say it wasn't there, but we ended up doing just that?

[01:25] <AlexDaniel> how come the option that wasn't there was picked in the end

[01:25] <Juerd> Personally, what was once my stage name (nickname, handle) became my legal name, in part because it was too hard to keep both names around.

[01:25] <tony-o> because he responded to your request

[01:25] <tony-o> so, it wasn't picked, he responded and everyone acted in kind

[01:26] <AlexDaniel> just stop bending the truth, there's no grand evil conspiracy behind a simple alias

[01:26] <Juerd> So I can definitely see that happening, even if initially people aren't specifically planning for it.

[01:26] <tony-o> i'm not bending the truth or claiming evil conspiracy.  i'm saying that the past is being recounted in a really dishonest way

[01:26] <Juerd> AlexDaniel: It might happen despite explicit disclaimers

[01:27] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: I'm not denying that “Raku” may be used by majority in the end, time will tell. “Perl 6” can also be in that position

[01:29] <Juerd> AlexDaniel: Both those in favour of that, and those afraid of that, will assume it will happen.

[01:35] <tony-o> Juerd: gross.  it's leaf blowers here

[01:36] <Juerd> I'm sure many will be able to recount the events accurately, but how likely is that in a hot debate where everyone seems to have a strong opinion?

[01:38] <tony-o> i don't really care, i don't like the idea of an alias - either rename it or don't - but i'll still help maintain zef

[01:38] <tony-o> but it's not really a decent debate if the facts are made up as you go

[01:39] <AlexDaniel> that's right

[01:41] <Juerd> Agreed there, an alias is hard work and leads to a lot of misunderstanding without actually getting rid of the old name. I've been in favour of renaming (I'm sure you'll be able to find proof of this from 2004 or 2006), but I've come to accept that it wasn't going to happen. The alias seems like none(@solutions) ~~ any(@problems)

[01:41] <tony-o> claiming the request is only 2 months old is a little disingenuous for my taste as that discussion has been going on longer than i've been in the perl6 game (and that's a lot longer than 2 months)

[01:41] <dduncan> ingy: Actually, MUON is already the stage name for my format; its full name is Muldis Object Notation.

[01:41] <tony-o> Juerd: lol, that's perfect "The alias seems like none(@solutions) ~~ any(@problems)"

[01:41] <Juerd> tony-o: As far as I know, the *alias* request is pretty young. Most related discussion over the past 15 years has been about *renaming*.

[02:06] <ferreira> The creation of the alias is a conciliation. Read the fine print: Larry Wall does not want to let go of the Perl 6 name. And why should he? He created Perl 1 to 6, and is supposed to have a say in that (following the the usual respect open-source community gives to such benevolent dictators).

[02:09] <Zoffix> tony-o: I think you misunderstood what I said. My original blog posts are dated so you could verify exact dates. Going by memory, the start was summer 2017 when I made the argument that the name was detrimental and said I would start using "Rakudo". About two month later someone asked Larry what he thought about the idea, at which point larry mentioned the alias idea. We got excited and birthed "6lang" as

[02:10] <ferreira> And finally the alias gives you a name to take Perl  to people who would not want to look at it just because of the name. Pretty silly, but the alias work in these 3 fronts.

[02:10] <Zoffix> alias and started using it, and moritz immediatelly asked us to stop until final decision and it was decided the decision will be made during 6.d release. You can see the commits to perl6/6 d-prep repo to find the date when I first added alias to TODO with my makimg request to Larry a month before release. The 6.d got delayed by a year and spec review took me longer than anticipated so I didn't prepare the

[02:10] <Zoffix> detailed marketing plan, but other than that I did write my open letter to Larry a month before Diwali. This is the first time I proposed anything to Larry directly.

[02:10] <Zoffix> woolfy: I didn't take you to any beaches, the decision was rendered by Larry

[04:25] <Xliff> OK. Correction on my last bit. It is working. I had to restart from scratch.

[09:00] <CIAvash> TimToady made an alias as a middle ground and compromise(between doing nothing and renaming), but one side is not happy with even a compromise. It's probably best to wait for TimToady to come back and talk to us, instead of us speaking on his behalf.

[09:54] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v andrzejku

[09:54] <El_Che> Altreus: yeah :(

[09:55] <lizmat> Altreus El_Che: you have a right to say that once you've organized a 3-day conference for 300+ people on your own taking all financial risk

[09:55] <lizmat> as far as I know, you haven't, so please stop that

[09:56] <El_Che> lizmat: you miss the point

[09:56] <lizmat> as long as the Perl community is dependent on people such as ash to have their conferences organized

[09:56] <Altreus> Seems like the point of an alias is you don't have to change anything if you're using the original ref

[09:56] <El_Che> the guy can be gandhi, but even if Ghandi throws a tantrum is still a childish move

[09:56] <lizmat> I think you're missing the poinnt

[09:57] <lizmat> "Seems like the point of an alias is you don't have to change anything if you're using the original ref"

[09:57] <lizmat> Altreus: indeed

[09:57] <lizmat> and that's exactly what is happening onw

[09:57] <El_Che> you missed the tantrum? Do you need links with the threads and "I take my football home" posts?

[09:58] <lizmat> if you start announcing things like "Raku Perl 6", you've soiled both brands

[09:58] <El_Che> anyway, he can do whatever hi wants with *his* conference

[09:58] <lizmat> El_Che: sorry to hear that, but that's life

[09:58] <El_Che> that's what I used to tell children that behave like that when I was a child

[09:58] <El_Che> yep

[09:58] <lizmat> I mean FOSDEM can also be considered childish for not having a Perl DevRoom in 2019

[09:59] <lizmat> there are reasons

[09:59] <El_Che> yes

[09:59] <lizmat> shit happens

[09:59] <El_Che> Perl 5 is loosing popularity, perl 6 still looks for a niche

[09:59] <El_Che> that is what happens

[09:59] <El_Che> but nobody throw an tantrum

[09:59] <El_Che> nobody threatened to kill anything over the years for whatever reason

[09:59] <lizmat> I remember at least one tantrum that involved some coffee cups

[09:59] <El_Che> you know why? adults

[10:00] * lizmat wil concentrate on writing a blog now

[10:02] <El_Che> lizmat: I understand and respect all of your arguments (while agreeing and disagreeing with many of those), besides the one defending a tantrum that killed the biggest perl conference in Europe.

[10:02] *** zakharyas joined
[10:02] <El_Che> Shit happens is a weak excuse

[10:03] <lizmat> I repeat: as long as the Perl community is dependent on people such as ash to have their conferences organized

[10:03] <El_Che> yes, we're fucked. I got that

[10:04] <woolfy> dduncan: Rakudo already was an alias.  Not officially named as such by Larry.  But I never saw the need for that, as it was / is widely used.

[10:04] <lizmat> we have *no* right to say anything about anything that person does

[10:04] <lizmat> we can suggest at most

[10:05] <El_Che> does? He just singlehanded killed it with a pluralis majestatis to give the impression that there is 1 than more person behind that account

[10:05] <lizmat> El_Che: we were fucked long before ash offered to do a conference

[10:05] <Altreus> if it's the biggest perl conference in Europe, why can't I find it on google?

[10:05] <El_Che> lizmat: I agree on that part

[10:05] <Altreus> I hadn't heard of it until now

[10:05] <El_Che> Altreus: because we suck on marketing is the mantra :)

[10:05] <lizmat> so instead of keeping going on about ash, instead you should start getting people together for a conference in 2020

[10:06] *** domidumont left
[10:06] <woolfy> AlexDaniel: quite some people, including me, were very vocal against any official alias.  We did not want to go to the beach, not for swimming, not for sunbathing, just not the beach.  A museum would be fine (no official alias).  People went to the beach without us.  The group was split.

[10:06] <lizmat> or in 2019, should ash continue his stance

[10:06] <lizmat> anything else is not constructive and not helping

[10:06] *** domidumont joined
[10:06] <lizmat> and I think I can say what I'm saying, having been deeply involved in 2 european Perl conferences

[10:07] <lizmat> and many, many Perl workshops and Perl Monger meetings

[10:07] *** zakharyas left
[10:07] <El_Che> lizmat: I struggling to see the point to organise a conference where everyone is unhappy with the status quo and unhappy about minimal changes

[10:07] <lizmat> I think ash would agree with you there

[10:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v domidumont

[10:07] <El_Che> we seem to have the same discussion every 6 months

[10:07] <woolfy> dduncan: people with a high risk of skin cancer cannot go to the beach, cannot sit under an umbrella: the radiation is just too high.  Example: my brother-in-law.  I learned a lot about cancer the last couple of years.  And Perl 6 is not about cancer.  This was about leaving people behind who did not wanted to go to the beach.

[10:07] <lizmat> because not enough people are doing things

[10:08] <El_Che> (again, I am not dismissing ashes past work or intentions, but his behaviour on this case)

[10:08] <El_Che> (I would have respected if he cancelled, but not the threatening for reasons unrelated to the conference)

[10:09] <lizmat> yeah, we should take him to a shrink to fix his tantrums: but don't fix him too much, we need the books and the conferences

[10:10] <lizmat> I think it would be an adult who could accept a tantrum from someone who is doing a lot of work for the community

[10:10] <El_Che> by the way, I am organising an (academic) conference in France in februari. I am not afraid of the work, but it feels in our case whatever you do, you loose

[10:10] <lizmat> yeah, you lose.  And if you're lucky, it won't cost you much

[10:11] <lizmat> in the TPCiA case, Wendy and I were not so lucky

[10:11] <lizmat> you can do a lot of good with 20K euros

[10:11] <El_Che> lizmat: I explained that for conferences if not profesional it has consequences at work

[10:11] <El_Che> I wouldn't care if ash burns all his perl 6 books in a tantrum

[10:11] <El_Che> or comes here yelling (he hasn't for the record)

[10:12] *** kdr21 left
[10:12] <lizmat> so because *you* have a problem at work with an "unprofessional" conference, you need to go on about it here ?

[10:12] <El_Che> but If people need to get approval to go to a conference and it's cancelled because of infighting you look like a fool

[10:12] <lizmat> isn't that a bit, dare I say, childish ?

[10:12] <El_Che> in our case, plane are booked well in advanced, non refundable

[10:12] <Kaiepi> why is there so much drama here lately?

[10:13] <El_Che> it is our problem, but that's how it works in our place (not my decision)

[10:13] <lizmat> then that is a problem for you and your organisation

[10:13] <lizmat> don't bring that here

[10:13] <El_Che> yes, it is

[10:13] <El_Che> sadly, you'll find it's more the rule than the exception

[10:14] <scimon> El_Che: I'm going to cover 24 different Perl6 modules

[10:14] <El_Che> anyway, like I said, I don't care (that much) now, I am trying to mentally move on an accept that the conference is not for me

[10:14] <Kaiepi> which ones, if you don't mind sharing?

[10:17] <scimon> Still choosing and I'd like to have some kind of surprise.

[10:17] <tadzik> Kaiepi: because there is drama in the entire community, around us here, so to say

[10:18] <Kaiepi> ah

[10:18] <Kaiepi> should've expected, it's common in language communities

[10:19] <El_Che> Kaiepi: we're all kind of special

[10:20] <Kaiepi> true

[10:20] <Kaiepi> it takes a special kind of person to be bold enough to stan a language that hasn't achieved great acceptance yet

[10:20] <scimon> I'm keeping my head down on the alias thing. 

[10:21] <Kaiepi> personally i don't care about the alias thing

[10:21] <timotimo> scimon: if you're going to cover one of mine, give me a heads-up so i can maybe paint over the most unsightly parts before people come storming my github page to read the code %)

[10:22] <Kaiepi> i doubt any of my modules will show up in the talk but if they do let me know

[10:22] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez : stop saying that the biggest Perl Conference is killed.  You are not truthfully in that.  The conference is not killed.  Shitov has paused the conference.  

[10:22] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: I told you yesterday already.  Also, that in fact, he went on with organising work, I saw him do that.

[10:22] <El_Che> woolfy: you missed until the Alias is "unannounced"

[10:23] <El_Che> woolfy: why are you ignoring the most relevant part, the demands/ultimatum?

[10:23] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: you keep repeating "tantrum tantrum" sounds like you really want him to stop organising so you have the best of reasons not to go.  What?  really?

[10:23] <Kaiepi> it's good to see people care so much about the conferences, but just remember not everyone has the capability to make it to them

[10:23] <El_Che> It's good that you give him credit in believe in his intentions and not his words

[10:24] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: " He just singlehanded killed it " What?  He said he paused it.  And meanwhile, he went on.  You are not correct here.

[10:24] <El_Che> as I don't know the guy, I take is words and actions at face value

[10:24] <El_Che> I am not a psychologist to know if the threatening is of bargaining chip or not

[10:24] <tadzik> to follow up on Kaiepi: not everyone can pick and choose which ones they want to go to as they pop up

[10:24] <El_Che> s/of/a/

[10:25] <tadzik> in some cases it requires month of planning, either for work trips, vacation days, syncing it with spouses etc.

[10:25] <woolfy> Shitov has made it very clear he was organising a conference for Perl.  Perl 5 and Perl 6.  he was busy with stuff for Perl 6, not for Raku.  He paused it untill the naming issue was resolved.

[10:25] <El_Che> woolfy: so, in short, you know the guy and you thing it's just empty threats. He will keep organising despite what he said.

[10:25] <tadzik> if you save all your efforts for that one, biggest one each year and then there's suddenly a menacing "pause" in its organization, there'd better be a good reason, you'd think, right?

[10:26] <El_Che> woolfy: that pretty much the definition of unprofessionalism to me.

[10:26] <tadzik> but when the reason is so obviously personal, it does not look very comforting indeed

[10:26] <tadzik> to avoid using the u-wor

[10:27] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: I did not miss that.  I take it with a grain of salt.

[10:27] <tadzik> the perl community is much bigger than this naming debate

[10:27] <woolfy> (I mean, the unannounced bit)

[10:27] <Kaiepi> i wouldn't try to read people minds like this

[10:27] <El_Che> woolfy: again, you know the guy. I don't. I take his words at face value.

[10:27] <tadzik> we're making the entire community suffer becuase of an issue that *right now* only affects a select few

[10:27] <tadzik> and we don't know if it will ever effectively affect anybody at all

[10:28] *** cognominal-p6 left
[10:28] *** sena_kun left
[10:28] <El_Che> The organiser can ignore the raku *alias* completely for all I care.

[10:29] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: it is not empty threats.  I know the guy.  Shitov has organised YAPC::Europe Riga and YAPC Europe Kiev and a lot of YAPC::Russias and other Perl-conferences and workshops.  Shitov wrote Perl 6 at a Glance, Perl 6 Deep Dive and Using Perl.  

[10:29] <El_Che> But pausing the conference until the alias is retracted (== killing if not retracted) is something completely else

[10:29] <tadzik> well, his rationale is that when you're making a conference for a language it's a bit tricky when it suddenly changes its name :)

[10:29] <tadzik> but I really, really don't think that's the case here

[10:29] <woolfy> Shitov is the person who has organised the largest amount of Perl events.  If you do not know him, you have not been paying attention to the Perl world.

[10:29] <El_Che> woolfy: if the threat is not empty, it's a real one. That's how I interpreted the communication. On that level, we agree then

[10:29] <tadzik> I am completely sure that whatever, if any, alias actually catches on we won't see the effect in the general public until at least 2020

[10:30] <El_Che> I wonder if a tantrum would be in order if mst re-announced Pumpkin Perl. I guess it wouldn't.

[10:30] <woolfy> If anybody is a professional, it is Andrew Shitov.  Organised 10+ YAPC's, 10+ Perl workshops, wrote 3 Perl 6 books (the first Perl 6 book ever that is useful), and contributed a lot to Perl 6.

[10:30] *** HaraldJoerg left
[10:30] <El_Che> that's besides the point

[10:31] <tadzik> woolfy: I don't believe any of us is diminishing his importance and the value of his work

[10:31] <woolfy> And now Perl 6 is going to be renamed and all the work that Shitov has put into writing Perl 6 books (not Raku books), to promote Perl 6, is what...  a waste of time?

[10:31] <El_Che> he may be the creator of Linux, Perl and the Supernintendo for all of care.

[10:31] <woolfy> Of course he throws a tantrum.  I did too.  And I am still in tantrum mode.

[10:31] <moritz> woolfy: but it *isn't* being renamed

[10:31] <tadzik> but nobody should be shielded from criticism because of things they've done in the past. And I do believe that what he does now is subject to criticism

[10:32] <El_Che> If you threaten to kill a conference because people don't agree with you, your previous merits don't matter on this question

[10:32] <moritz> heck, I've written Perl 6 books myself, and I don't feel threatened by this new alias

[10:32] *** kerframil joined
[10:32] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kerframil

[10:32] <tadzik> this topic deserves a discussion panel at a conference, not a conference shutdown

[10:32] <tadzik> our community is split, you don't need to be ash to see it

[10:32] <El_Che> woolfy: you're consistently talking about renaming instead of aliasing. I think you missed TimToady's decision.

[10:32] <tadzik> you don't fix arguments by shutting yourself off in another room

[10:32] <woolfy> moritz: but it is being renamed, slowly, bit by bit.  

[10:33] <El_Che> for the records, I would have loved I renaming. 

[10:33] <moritz> woolfy: I don't see evidence for that

[10:33] <El_Che> but that's not what we're talking here

[10:33] <El_Che> see my remark on how he can ignore the raku alias for all I care

[10:33] <scimon> timotimo: I'll try and notify people.

[10:33] *** kerframil left
[10:35] <El_Che> woolfy: the thing I don't get in your argument is. 1. How to misrepresent an alias for a rename. 2. How you accept the "pausing" of the conference because the guy did good stuff before, ignoring the real life consequences that kind of behaviour has for the conference as a whole.

[10:35] <woolfy> Perl 5 people are crowing victory.  "FREE AT LAST", even, even with racist and insulting smears.

[10:35] <El_Che> "Perl 5 people"

[10:35] <El_Che> you're illustrating tadzik point about the fracured community

[10:36] <woolfy> Yes, and I even saw somebody asking "so, now we can finally rename the next major update to Perl 5 to Perl 6?"

[10:36] *** Celelibi left
[10:36] <El_Che> woolfy: someone will ask that every 6 month and the heated discussions will return, burning some out again

[10:36] <El_Che> hence why I *do* prefer a rename

[10:37] <El_Che> the discussion will never go away

[10:37] <El_Che> *however* this is NOT *this* discussion

[10:37] <El_Che> there is no need to go to the atomic option

[10:37] <moritz> even if we did a rename, the "Perl 6" name would be burned to be ever used for Perl 5

[10:37] <El_Che> just wait, it will return

[10:37] <El_Che> moritz: certainly

[10:37] <El_Che> moritz: 6 is kind of a course version

[10:38] <woolfy> Yes, but now Larry has said it is an ok alias .  And at several places, Raku is mentioned instead of Perl 6.  Zoffix even wrote a misleading text about Raku in his new brochure.  And off it goes.  This is going to go further and further.

[10:38] <El_Che> (see PHP)

[10:38] <El_Che> woolfy: yes, as it as expected

[10:38] <tadzik> I do think that it was a bit early of Zoffix to use the alias already

[10:39] *** kdr21 joined
[10:39] <El_Che> woolfy: I think a rename is needed, didn't get that, I would have loved to use the Rakudo alias (I love that name), didn't get that, so I'll use Raku as decided by Larry

[10:39] <El_Che> I don't see the drama

[10:39] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: dammit man, stop your childish behavior on what Shitov did...  "atomic option".  

[10:39] <tadzik> El_Che: there's never drama in "I" :)

[10:39] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: stop your own drama.

[10:39] <El_Che> if people love the Perl 6 brand they'll keep using that and Raku will be a forgotten detail

[10:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kdr21

[10:40] <El_Che> if people prefer the alias, maybe Zoffix had a good point after all

[10:43] <woolfy> My tantrum sofar is, and Liz has stopped me doing it, is that I would rather stop supporting Perl altogether than use the name Raku.  But as said, Liz has convinced me for now that I should not stop.

[10:43] *** noganex joined
[10:43] <woolfy> Therefore I will continue.  As today, preparing for Amsterdam Perl Mongers meeting, packing boxes and bags with swag for sale.

[10:44] <CIAvash> woolfy: Why are you pretending that people are making you use Raku? Use Perl 6

[10:44] <El_Che> woolfy: without trolling you, that's the atomic version (" stop supporting Perl altogether")

[10:45] <El_Che> maybe lizmat's blogpost idea is a good one. It may be less heated.

[10:46] <Kaiepi> that's like cutting off contact with someone because they have a nickname you don't like

[10:46] <Kaiepi> not everyone's going to call it raku

[10:48] *** Celelibi joined
[10:48] <El_Che> woolfy: you're probably mad at me now. But I don't think different opinions should result in that scenario. In fact it will result in people not talking and resulting in more fracturing.

[10:48] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: oooh, now you got more drama...  Wendy said she is going to go atomic.  How often are you going to repeat that?  You repeated it dozens of times about Shitov.

[10:48] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Celelibi

[10:48] <El_Che> To be honest, the Perl 6 community is to small to afford that

[10:49] <El_Che> woolfy: because --in my view-- that's exactly what he did

[10:49] <woolfy> And if you read my text, is that I am going on.  You see that, don't you?  Or are you going to ignore that bit?

[10:49] <tadzik> Kaiepi: I think woolfy's argument is that we may call it a nickname, but it will eventually become The Name. And thus destroy the work of people who worked their asses of to build and promote the Old Name

[10:49] <tadzik> I understand that sentiment completely

[10:49] <Kaiepi> ah

[10:49] <Kaiepi> i misunderstood

[10:49] <tadzik> people have invested much, including themselves, into the name Perl 6

[10:49] <tadzik> Kaiepi: perhaps I have as well, but that's my best shot at it

[10:50] <El_Che> the thing is, that *that* is exactly the argument of Perl 5 people against the Perl 6 name.

[10:50] <El_Che> exactly

[10:50] <woolfy> tadzik Kaiepi : indeed.  Because that is my prediction.  Perl 6 as a name is slowly but gradually going to be replaced with Raku.  And then I can throw away my badges and buttons and stickers and tuits and brochures and Camelia Perl 6 butterfly stuffed toys and get myself drunk day after day by drinking my own Perl 6 wine.

[10:50] <tadzik> I wonder if C people made this argument about C++ at some point

[10:51] <woolfy> tadzik Kaiepi : Already, two people (Perl 5 people) said that if Raku is going to be the name of Perl 6, all Raku modules should be removed from CPAN because Raku is Raku and not perl.

[10:51] <tadzik> woolfy: hah, that's indeed a interesting development

[10:51] <Kaiepi> jesus

[10:51] <woolfy> One of the next steps is that Perl conferences will no longer accept Raku talks because Raku is not Perl.

[10:52] <El_Che> tadzik: I guess so, but less because of the lack of following versions numbers

[10:52] <Kaiepi> this is more serious than i thought

[10:52] <tadzik> woolfy: and I agree with you for the most part. I think the decision was made hastily, or at least hastily implemented. It has now caused damage before it has done anything good

[10:53] *** x[LGWs4x4i]uG2N0 left
[10:53] <tadzik> HOWEVER, I do not agree with actions of some in response to this. We're not an authoritarian state where if you don't like certain changes, you leave and never come back. There is room for discussion, debate, and change. And rollbacks. And clarifications

[10:53] <woolfy> We all know PerlMonks not being "friendly" about Perl 6.  Imagine how happy they are, they won, victory, Perl 6 can now f**k off, since it is Raku, and no longer Perl 6, so soon (maybe now already) Perl 6 is really absolutely unwelcome there.  And that is just one of the places...

[10:54] <El_Che> o

[10:54] <tadzik> perhaps, *if* this is going to follow through, there's a need for a branding specification, like there's always a spec for using a flag: you can use this flag in this situation, this flag in this, you can'd to this and that to a flag and whatnot

[10:54] <Altreus> do you suppose if Larry had started off calling it Raku, then places like Perlmongers would accept it because it's Larry's new thing and it's kinda like Perl?

[10:55] <tadzik> if there was an official alias, I'd consider it obligatory for it to have a writeup on when and how it should be used

[10:55] <El_Che> I should register that :)

[10:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Skarsnik

[10:55] <ribasushi_> >woolfy>	tadzik Kaiepi : Already, two people (Perl 5 people) said  ... modules should be removed from CPAN 

[10:56] <tadzik> for example: Raku Perl 6 in official announcements, Raku in casual conversations, Perl 6 only in technical documentation

[10:56] <ribasushi_> woolfy: can you link me to these?

[10:56] <tadzik> I'm sure that's how a lot of people understand this already, myself included

[10:56] <El_Che> ribasushi_: weren't you one of those people? :)

[10:56] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: good riddance?  Ah, well, thank you, I am still sad that my beloved PerlMonks became such a toxic place towards Perl 6.  I have spent hundreds of hours there, loving Perl, reading and writing.  Good Riddance is toxic to the core.  Thank you for being toxic.  You really just made my day. :-(

[10:56] <tadzik> it *feels* like that's what a nickname Should Be

[10:56] <tadzik> I'm Tadeusz „tadzik” Sośnierz in git logs, tadzik here, and in my national ID nobody cares about "tadzik" for a good reason

[10:56] <ribasushi_> not at all - I *specifically* jumped in to say that the "raku debacle" has nothing to do with any of what I am working on

[10:56] <woolfy> ribasushi: no thank you, you have been toxic enough, you can find it yourself.

[10:57] <Altreus> steady on

[10:57] <Altreus> no need to set fire to people when they're actually here

[10:57] <Altreus> then we all end up aflame

[10:57] <woolfy> ribasushi: you said you are working on an alternative to CPAN where no perl 6 will be

[10:58] <El_Che> woolfy: toxic? The place is very negative about Perl 6. The format is a 90s format, alien to new programmers. It's a time machine. I am not being toxic, I am saying "choose your battles, perlmonks is not worth fighting for"

[10:58] <tadzik> if there's anything worth boycotting, IMHO, is the aliasing itself, since it's the least establish and well-defined of the names we have

[10:58] <tadzik> figure it out before it causes conflict

[10:58] <tadzik> and as of now, more conflict

[10:58] <tadzik> so, in the words of ash: I'd like for the aliasing to be officially paused until futher notice

[10:58] <woolfy> tadzik: I am already boycotting the alias and I am not the only one...

[10:58] <El_Che> ribasushi_: thanks for the clarification

[10:59] <tadzik> woolfy: I find that perfectly reasonable

[10:59] <Altreus> have to agree with the sentiment about perlmonks

[10:59] <ribasushi_> woolfy: yes, I have been working on that since late 2016, mainly so there's a "no pull-request-challenge" cpan for those who want to get some work done. Among other things - yes I am not interested in hosting ( and paying for ) rakudo code, and because my work is *not* yet published, and there's a lot of ways to go, I jumped in to set the record as in "Zoffix didn't make me do anything"

[10:59] <Altreus> I've not been there for a decade

[10:59] <Altreus> I'm surprised it's still in use

[11:00] <ribasushi_> woolfy: `whois cpan.plus` reistered *way* before raku or any other renaming/alias talk started

[11:00] <ribasushi_> El_Che: ^^

[11:00] <CIAvash> tadzik: yes, that's why I asked before the aliasing if anybody thought about what happens afterwards. The details were not specified.

[11:00] <Altreus> Anyway, I like Perl5 and I like Perl6 a little bit more but I'm not very good at it yet. I don't really care what it's called but I don't own either name, so I'm in no position to have an emotional connection to them

[11:01] <ribasushi_> that aside - I have no plans to work with anyone / influence anything on cpan.org - it can host whatever it wants to host

[11:01] <Altreus> Seems like most arguments are get-off-my-lawn arguments

[11:01] <ribasushi_> woolfy: does this alleviate your concern?

[11:03] <El_Che> whatever we do we're fucked

[11:03] <tadzik> Altreus: I think a lot of people are looking at this as a "we won" or "we lost" or "they lost" topic :/

[11:03] <Skarsnik> I don't care ^^

[11:03] <Altreus> yes because people seem to think it's a war

[11:03] <timotimo> ribasushi_: is cpan.plus going to throw out like 50% of perl 5 code?

[11:03] <El_Che> - we do nothing: we alienate many Perl 5 people and also Perl 6 people that experience that the name is a blocking factor for adoption

[11:03] <tadzik> Altreus: I guess it is to some, as some demonstrated

[11:04] <woolfy> ribasushi : no

[11:04] <Altreus> those are the toxic people

[11:04] <ribasushi_> timotimo: that's offtopic

[11:04] <tadzik> "we're free at last, yayaya" and all that crap. Come on

[11:04] <El_Che> - we rename it: we alienate lots of core people

[11:04] <El_Che> - we alias it: same as aboce

[11:04] <El_Che> above

[11:04] <timotimo> ribasushi_: i'm just trying to understand what kind of sense "i don't want to host rakudo code" makes

[11:04] <El_Che> we loose whatever we do

[11:04] <timotimo> apart from "rakudo code" not being A Thing

[11:04] <Altreus> anyone who thinks there's a war on who gets to use the name "perl" hasn't recognised that it's not theirs to protect

[11:04] <timotimo> as far as i know, no parts of rakudo are hosted on cpan

[11:05] <Altreus> The problems I can legitimately understand are a) the world in general hates Perl and we shouldn't use the name, and b) Perl5 and Perl6 are different things and we shouldn't try to make the one infrastructure support the other's ecosystem

[11:05] <ribasushi_> timotimo: in light of the current temperature discussing this here and now won't be productive, plus I am still designing things

[11:06] <timotimo> OK

[11:06] <CIAvash> tadzik: But I should have opened an issue for it instead of just asking on irc

[11:06] <Altreus> the whole CPAN thing just feels like Perl6 is a little brother who's trying to be friends with Perl5 but Perl5 doesn't want it but their parents are making them share a room

[11:06] <ribasushi_> I signed in to understand what woolfy meant with "people are going to remove code from cpan" ( which imples cpan.org, for which I have zero plans to ever get involved with again )

[11:07] <El_Che> ribasushi_: you have a closet full of fire resistent clothing, I pressume :)

[11:08] *** ilmari left
[11:08] <ribasushi_> woolfy: you mentioned "two perl5 people said" - ok, one is you misunderstanding what I meant / implied. can you link me to the second instance?

[11:08] <ribasushi_> El_Che: you have no idea...

[11:09] <El_Che> ribasushi_: I remeber a few ocassions, though ;)

[11:11] <woolfy> ribasushi : no, I read your comment somewhere, and can't even find that one again, I just looked and can't find the other one.

[11:11] <El_Che> Polls just opened in the USA. I'll switch to that drama today

[11:11] <woolfy> ribasushi : you can understand that what you said can (and will) be misunderstood easily?

[11:13] <woolfy> ribasushi: and my " people are going to remove code from cpan" is of course meant "people will remove perl 6 eh raku code from PAUSE", because that is my prediction, and I have learned that Perl 6 stuff is not on CPAN but on PAUSE.  And I did other predictions.  And I would be extremely happy if my predictions will be proven wrong on the long run.

[11:14] <tadzik> CIAvash: well, you're not at fault here, as apparently this whole thing went on on IRC without a proper process

[11:14] <El_Che> tadzik: see my scenarios above. What ever is decided upon will result in some people being extremely unhappy.

[11:15] <ribasushi_> woolfy: I personally have no interest in influencing anything on PAUSE/CPAN/Metacpan, you have my word for it

[11:15] <tadzik> El_Che: yes indeed. And that's why I also think we shouldn't implement either

[11:15] <tadzik> I'm okay with the idea of a nickname, as long as everyone knows and agrees on what "nickname" means

[11:15] <El_Che> tadzik: there is zero scenario that I can think of that would result in general happiness. I hoped the alias was a "good enough" compromis for most people.

[11:15] <tadzik> otherwise, if we arbitrarily assign a name to a thing we make a lot of people confused and unhappy

[11:15] <tadzik> it feels like we've been there before

[11:15] <tadzik> hmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[11:15] <El_Che> we have

[11:16] <El_Che> and we will be again in about 6 months

[11:16] <El_Che> give or take some weeks

[11:16] <ribasushi_> and my dislike of rakudo is easily rivaled with my disdain of p5p, so no favoritism either

[11:16] <ribasushi_> anyway, carry on &

[11:16] *** ribasushi_ left
[11:16] <woolfy> ribasushi : thank you.  Please, the next time you make a comment about what you are doing, please make it a bit clearer, so you don't make me extremely unhappy with thinking "riba is going to kill Perl 6 on CPAN".  Because you got me there in tears.

[11:17] <woolfy> dammit, I should have typed 10 seconds faster...

[11:17] <Altreus> I don't want to be insensitive, but why is it so important to you that Perl6 stuff is available on CPAN?

[11:17] <tadzik> woolfy: I think we're all guilty here about assuming intentions about a few words being spoken :(

[11:17] <woolfy> tadzik : oh indeed

[11:17] <tadzik> and now we have a war over *perceived intentions* more than anything else

[11:17] <El_Che> woolfy: I read it as "riba is working on a secret Perl5 only CPAN alternative, not on chaging CPAN itself"

[11:17] <tadzik> it's dumb

[11:17] <woolfy> Altreus: because to me, CPAN is the core of all things Perl...

[11:17] *** domidumont left
[11:18] <woolfy> tadzik: I never said i am not dumb

[11:18] <El_Che> woolfy: old school perl when there was no decentralised github/gitlab/etc alternatives and no free travis-like services

[11:18] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: you read that in those few words?  Wow.  I am jealous of your genius.  I feel dumber by the moment.

[11:18] <Altreus> But again it feels like Perl6 is trying to be Perl5's younger sibling and Perl5 just wants to do its homework in peace

[11:18] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: thank you for explaining what I already know.  Please stop there.

[11:18] <tadzik> woolfy: oh, we all are, it takes a wise one to know that :)

[11:18] <El_Che> woolfy: don't go there. There is no need to antagonize on this.

[11:19] <tadzik> we're all very good at jumping to conclusions

[11:19] <tadzik> it usually works fine as a survival mechanism

[11:19] <tadzik> not so much here and now

[11:19] <El_Che> I am saying that's how I read ribasushi's words, I am not passing judgement on you.

[11:19] *** kurahaupo_ is now known as kurahaupo

[11:19] <Altreus> I have to wonder why it is if he has disdain for both Perl6 and p5p he doesn't go and use Rust or something

[11:20] <Altreus> I hear PHP7 is out :P

[11:20] <El_Che> woolfy: and again, I am not angry at you. I hope the sentiment on the other direction will fade with time.

[11:20] <tadzik> Altreus: they say you can't say you truly know something unless you hate some parts of it :P

[11:20] <El_Che> Altreus: ribasushi and rurban are known for their feelings towards p5p :)

[11:21] <masak> oh, look -- people are angry again about naming and *checks notes* aliasing.

[11:21] <masak> I should release a module that transforms naming anger into actual useful code.

[11:21] <woolfy> Claudio Ramirez: I am not angry at you, I am angry at the whole thing and sad and frustrated and seeing all that money and time and effort and energy going to the garbage bin...  You are one of the people who my anger is reaching...  (pfff my English is not sufficient here)

[11:22] <El_Che> woolfy: "glad" to hear that. And I get the argument about money and effort spent by you and liz. We all love you for that

[11:22] <masak> sorry for not engaging more in the naming anger thing. I'm very turned off by it. I will no go do something useful.

[11:23] <El_Che> Thing is, that we have a huge problem and we're having this conversation every 6 months. And whatever we do or don't do, we're stuck in the same loop again.

[11:23] <woolfy> Altreus : I know ribasushi pretty well, personally, and I have asked him that question repeatedly: if you so much hate / disdain Perl 5 and Perl 6 (ok, P5P and Rakudo), why are you still working with it.  Basically, because he is very good at programming, and programming Perl 5 especially.

[11:23] <El_Che> sounds like a SF trope

[11:23] <tadzik> masak: oh oh, I know that module!

[11:24] <Altreus> he's typecast, like Jim Carrey

[11:24] <tadzik> masak: I think it's called IRC::Command::Part or something like that :P

[11:25] <tadzik> I think more people should use it to now when not to

[11:25] <woolfy> Altreus : ribasushi is very intelligent, and a good programmer, but diplomacy is not his strongest quality (neither is mine, I admit).

[11:32] <Kaiepi> it depends on the type of programmer i work with 

[11:33] <Kaiepi> i've worked with one in the past that passive aggressively and publicly shamed anyone who dared create a bug

[11:43] <andrewshitov> OK I see it I have to come in. Although I will not discuss any Perl 6 development-related stuff here

[11:43] <andrewshitov> first of all

[11:43] <tadzik> thanks for coming 

[11:44] <Skarsnik> Times -- gccxml: 0.37396727 sec; xml parsing: 3.81911616 sec; magic: 0.3714612 Hoo the XML use to take 20+ sec on my old computer/rakudo

[11:44] <CIAvash> Opened an issue for discussing the details of aliasing: https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues/31

[11:44] <andrewshitov> TimToady: Raku may mean something in Japanese, but in Russian it sounds very close to three things: cancer, anus and doggy-style. Not exactly, but I heard all of these in the last few days after alias announcement

[11:45] <andrewshitov> Now about the conference, mainly the opinions of El_Che

[11:45] <Skarsnik> xD

[11:45] <Skarsnik> Actually why not a name like the release name?

[11:45] <tadzik> :D

[11:46] <Skarsnik> Diwandi?

[11:46] <andrewshitov> El_Che: you are repeating three things: tantrum, killed the conference, and I have no right to do that

[11:46] <El_Che> andrewshitov: the first 2 actually. You have the right to do the third. As you did in my eyes.

[11:47] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  you should know that YAPC::Europe could have stop existing (or at least have a year-long gap) in 2013. If you are not familiar to how it happens, here it is: the YAPC Europe venue committee calls for the venue a few months before the current conference. A few groups of Perl monguers submit their proposals. The committee selects the best option and announces the city.

[11:48] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I know how you saved it in a few occasions. That's not the part I critique

[11:48] <andrewshitov> El_Che: In 2012, there were no proposals received by the Venue committee for hosting a conference in 2013

[11:48] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I also know about the books and other stuff. Again, not that

[11:48] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  The same story repeated in 2018

[11:49] <El_Che> Only the part "undo the alias or else"

[11:49] <El_Che> I would have get the "else" part

[11:49] <El_Che> the "screw you guys, I am going home" reference

[11:50] <El_Che> not the demand to undo something otherwise no conf

[11:50] <El_Che> so let's get that part straight

[11:50] <andrewshitov> El_Che: Let me continue. Regardless who is organising the conference in the end, they are doing it on their own risk. The YEF foundation can give maximum 1000 € as a kick-start donation (from the money which more or less come from the previous organisers).

[11:51] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  Once agian, a group hosting the conference does not receive any financial support from the YEF or TPF or whatever except the above small amount. 

[11:51] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I do not work for YEF or either official Perl organisation. I do not receive grants from there, I do not receive any salary from there.

[11:52] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I am in conference organising because of I love Perl (both 5 and 6) and I find it important to continue the conference despite all the difficulties.

[11:52] *** pecastro joined
[11:52] <AlexDaniel> :D :D

[11:53] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I would say you even more, the YEF organisation is thinking of closing itself, and by the way, I did not ask any kickstart donations from them this year. 

[11:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[11:54] <El_Che> andrewshitov: the language wasn't renamed during your preparation. Only an alias was created that you were completely free to ignore. Being pissed about it is OK, but it wouldn't have impacted the conf

[11:54] <andrewshitov> El_Che: Instead of shouting "tantrum", you would have asked if I need any help etc. I want you to know that there was a SINGLE person to offer real money after the Raku announce. And not because he was fond of the alias but because he wanted to keep the conference.

[11:54] <andrewshitov> El_Che: Wait, I will be there.

[11:54] <El_Che> (and let's be honest, is the same 200 people that will attend even if you renamed Perl 5 to Banana)

[11:55] *** pmurias joined
[11:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pmurias

[11:55] <El_Che> ok

[11:55] <Juerd> andrewshitov: Has any sponsor withdrawn because of the alias announcement?

[11:57] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  The conference budget of a YAPC::Europe size is 60 to 80 k euro. When I agreed to host 2019, I also agreed to myself that I could loose up to 20 K, which I take a risk. 20 K allows us to have a venue and mostly that's it. 

[11:57] <andrewshitov> Juerd: 0 of 1

[11:58] <Juerd> andrewshitov: I don't really understand how it's a financial risk then, if the single sponsor is still with the event. Maybe you expect visitors to drop out?

[11:58] *** Skarsnik left
[11:59] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I do not want to limit the conference to the same 200 people as you say. First of all, I am aiming at 300+ and I do not want that only old friends come again. I want new people too.

[11:59] <andrewshitov> El_Che: As you may noticed, we announced the conference with an idea that we want to have other languages welcome. 

[11:59] <El_Che> andrewshitov: seeing you calmfully explaining your reasoning, I will not use the word tantrum any longer in the discussion. However, how good the reasons you have to pull the plug, the communication (the "or else" part) was received at face value by people that don't know you well (like me) and come over as unprofessional ("will be a conference after I book my plane tickets?").

[12:00] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  btw, "we" is not "I". There are two people working on the conference preparation. Me and my friend, who is not a Perl developer (and not any other developer).

[12:02] <El_Che> andrewshitov: there is a difference between you talking as you or the conf demanding the removal of the alias.

[12:02] <El_Che> So in short, I understand the stress and the financial risk you take, and appreciate it enormly (although it may not looks like it)

[12:02] <andrewshitov> El_Che: We spent some time talking to people in Rīga to find the best prices etc. Also, we made lots of calculations to understand what should be ticket price taking into account that all these options. I have planned a few more visits to the city, which costs money if you agree.

[12:02] <El_Che> but as a organisation, I expect the communication to be above that

[12:03] <El_Che> otherwise you'll get the exact result... we've got

[12:03] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I am working on the conference because I love Perl. Other languages are welcome. Raku is not. That is my preference, indeed. 

[12:03] <El_Che> That's the thing. Raku is not a different language, just an alias that may or may not stick

[12:04] <El_Che> You're in no obligation whatsover to add it the conf site of materials

[12:04] *** aimileus joined
[12:04] *** aimileus left
[12:04] <El_Che> on the same logic, you can not force an unaliasing as a conference

[12:05] <El_Che> you can campaign against it as yourself, of course

[12:05] <El_Che> as lizmat and woolfy do

[12:05] <andrewshitov> El_Che: Juerd: but that preference is not only my opinion. After the announce, none of the already-agreed sponsors asked for a refund, but that's because there was only one sponsor who actually transferred money. Together with that, I heard another voice from the potential sponsor that they are thinking not to invest in Perl because Perl is about to be renamed. I have strong believe that that may become a thing among more sponsors.

[12:06] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I am doing a Perl conference, but I have no obligations to do anything for another language. If the author (or whoever works on his behalf) of Perl decides to rename it, I am no longer it. I do not see anything wrong here. I agreed to host a Perl conference, Perl become Raku, sorry.

[12:06] <tadzik> andrewshitov: you bring up an important point, both with your opinion and that potential sponsor you mention: the aliasing was poorly communicated and a lot of people assumed that it is/will be a rename

[12:07] <El_Che> andrewshitov: it's remarkable how we're talking about renaming and not aliasing

[12:07] <andrewshitov> tadzik: indeed I am coming to this.

[12:07] <tadzik> andrewshitov: so your (plural) intention here was to back off from supporting Raku/Perl6, not Perl altogether? (sorry for asking in the middle of your statement)

[12:07] <El_Che> also remarkable is how people that fervently oppose a real renaming and people that fervently favour a renaming (mostly Perl 5 people) see the alias a renaming.

[12:08] <Juerd> andrewshitov: I don't share that expectation, and it doesn't consider that there may be sponsors who will want to jump in because of the new developments.

[12:08] <tadzik> El_Che: like woolfy said, it's not hard to see the alias as a symptom of a plan for renaming

[12:08] <andrewshitov> El_Che: you say I killed the conference but that's wrong. I put the preparations on pause. If you follow the conference Facebook page or Twitter account (you do), you may have read there who many was already done for the conference to happen. In the reality when we have an unclear alias introduction, I do not want to spend more time each week.

[12:08] <El_Che> tadzik: that I can see, but that's evaluating intention not today's reality

[12:09] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  I do not want to move things on until it is clear for everyone what those "stage name" and "alias" terms actually mean.

[12:09] <El_Che> andrewshitov: by killed I meant that you paused the preparation until something is withdrawn you (or me) are in no position to demand

[12:09] <tadzik> andrewshitov: full agreement on that. However, I think that announcing a pause in preparations is exactly what "moving things" is

[12:10] <El_Che> so, pause until a impossible request is complied sound like forever paused to me

[12:11] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I strongly agree that the manner in which Raku was introduced resembles a coup d'etat or how do you spell it.

[12:12] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I would have been *perfectly* ok with: "We at @percon find the alias situation confusing at the moment and will use the official Perl 6 name in the coference". 

[12:12] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  It was briefly announced, and the next day appeared in a press release. BTW I wonder if anyone have seen it before it was published. Later, the questions on SO were retagged overnight. As we saw later, SO retagging was not an intention to replace the perl6 tag

[12:12] <El_Che> It's a clear statement that does not result in uncertainity

[12:12] <andrewshitov> El_Che: So you "killing" is my "wait until it is clear if Perl stays Perl". That's all.

[12:13] *** pmurias left
[12:13] <El_Che> Ok: are you OK if we remove the "killing" as the "threat" tweets?

[12:13] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  Yes, I am not going to support Raku rename personally. But that is not the main motive to pause conference preparation. Again, it is paused because this is unclear where Perl is moving.

[12:14] <El_Che> We pretty believe what we wrote, but it can de-escalate things a little

[12:14] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I won't cite you, but your message was very straightfwd

[12:14] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  And btw, noone suggested to host a conference in 2019 after Rīga preparations was paused.

[12:14] <El_Che> pause until unaliased

[12:16] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I get that part and I remember the search after no candidates where found

[12:16] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  Also, I think you mentioned that it breaks your travel/vacation plans. Unfortunately, the majority of the attendees buy a ticket (conference/flight/hotel) not earlier than 3-4 months before the conference. I would say you that even Gloria asked me not to buy a ticket that early (I wanted to expense it in 2018) because of possible flight change or smth. So although I agree with your concern of long vacation planning, other 

[12:16] <tadzik> andrewshitov: thank you for clearing this up, I think I understand your worries now, having misunderstood them from the tweets themselves

[12:17] <andrewshitov> tadzik: twits are as short as alias announcement :D

[12:17] <tadzik> andrewshitov: :D Fair point :)

[12:18] <andrewshitov> El_Che: another important thing about the alias. It meant to be a used if you like it. I don't. I am not going to use it in conference materials. Do you agree that I have the right to do so?

[12:18] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I removed the "killed" tweets. You do as you think you should do, but I suggest removing https://twitter.com/perlcon/status/1059193997430849536 and certainly this one https://twitter.com/perlcon/status/1059353130129874944. It's up to you.

[12:18] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  If I am not using the Raku name, but if I agree that many people will use and like it, how am I going to attract those people outside of those 200 you mention? 

[12:19] <tadzik> andrewshitov: and being a twitter critic of the @perlcon announcement, while I do agree with your analysis here (from the outside, it _does_ seem a bit like a coup), I think a twitter annoucement of this magnitude is a similar mistake to what the aliasing annoucement was

[12:19] <El_Che> andrewshitov: yes, that's the core idea of the alias. Use it if you want you.

[12:19] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  For removing, you'd better ask Steve Mayott :D

[12:19] <tadzik> andrewshitov: like you saw, a lot of people assumed that the conference is now dead and buried, a conclusion to which I partially jumped myself

[12:20] <andrewshitov> El_Che: I think the whole alias thing is not very well thought out. To work properly, Raku either have to be a separate project (then I will accept it), or a parallel world has to be created. I know that Perl 6 is good at parallelism and concurrency, but I doubt anyone is about to duplicate all perl6-related stuff to have a separate world for Raku-lovers.

[12:21] <tadzik> :P

[12:21] <El_Che> andrewshitov: you'll find in the backlog the 3 scenarios I meantioned. Damned if we do, damned if we don't.

[12:23] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  So the bottom like: I don't like the idea of an alias and am not going to use it. The conference is not cancelled (neither it is paused. The preparations are paused), but I want to know if Perl stays Perl and thus the PerlCon is a valid name.

[12:23] <El_Che> andrewshitov: personally I would have love to rename the lot to Rakudo (there is 1 implementation, we worry about the rest later). That would have pissed off a lot of people as well :)

[12:24] <El_Che> andrewshitov: I can reassure you that an alias does not change the language, is not a rename and does not fork the runtime.

[12:24] <andrewshitov> El_Che:  BTW, I came up with the new conference name, which was independently suggested in the venue list. Many people wanted to get rid of "YAPC" as many did not understand the meaning (nor pronunciation), and de-facto it was not a "yet another confernece" anymore. So we call it PerlCon (we = venue committee), and now it's not a Perl :)

[12:25] <El_Che> andrewshitov: all the other fears are hypotheticals about future evolutions, not something anyone can confirm today or in the near future

[12:26] <andrewshitov> El_Che: regarding reassuring, that's your personal opinion, but we've seen how nasty Zoffix introduced it, so fears of it continues are grounded

[12:26] *** ChoHag_ joined
[12:26] *** ChoHag left
[12:26] <El_Che> with Perl 6 staying the offcial name, PerlCon is fine for the time being (it would even be ok after a rename, it would be still a Perl family lang)

[12:27] <El_Che> andrewshitov: Like I said, I would *like* a rename, although not a sneaky one. But I don't see that happening here and certainly not in the timeframe of the conference.

[12:30] <El_Che> I wouldn't fear about name changes before the conf, as PerlConf is the perfect place to announce the renaming :)

[13:29] <patrickas> Hey I just read Liz' post and want to apologize to her and those who were upset by my adding a tag on Stackoverflow... I thought I was solving the problem ash mentioned on facebook but I ended up hurting people more. I should have been more tactful about it. Sorry again.

[13:31] <lucasb> anyway, just random suggestions :) I think having a blog.perl6.org would give a more central place to look for perl6 posts

[13:31] <Juerd> The way the weekly is written, results in a nicely consistent document and a single "voice" or style.

[13:31] <lucasb> you mean curated by a single person?

[13:32] <lizmat> yes, and Zoffix++ has taken the honours once or twice as well

[13:33] <Juerd> They're great posts because there's not much fluff. It's all straight forward and incredibly readable. I fear that community edited posts would get long winded and an overview of everyone's 2 cents.

[13:33] *** domidumont left
[13:33] <masak> yeah, "community editing" simply does not work in practice

[13:33] <masak> and on that note, I hope everyone appreciates how much work lizmat++ pours into the weekly every week

[13:42] <Juerd> Glad you like doing it, because I like reading it :)

[13:42] <Juerd> Have fun at the pm :)

[13:42] <tadzik> oh wow, that presentation sounds awesome :)

[13:42] <lizmat> Juerd: yes, I like doing it...  but it is getting to be a bit of a burden

[13:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v leont

[13:42] <tadzik> I wish I could be there

[13:43] <leont> Oh right, pm today. I might come, not sure yet

[13:43] <Kaiepi> i like seeing perl 6 content on twitter

[13:43] <masak> it does indeed sounds like a very nice presentation :)

[13:43] <leont> I discovered last night flatmap is deprecated in 6.d. That is a bit of a disappointment.

[13:43] <timotimo> i like seeing perl 6 content on mastodon :)

[13:44] <timotimo> leont: .map.flat is just one character more

[13:44] <leont> I mean, it's the map that actually does what map does in perl5, quit frankly I use it quite often

[13:44] <masak> timotimo: wow, that's the reason? might be the first time I see something deprecated in Perl 6 because there's an alternative, already built-in way to do it

[13:44] <timotimo> i don't think that's actually the reason

[13:44] <masak> didn't think so :)

[13:45] <timotimo> perhaps it was deemed a waste

[13:45] <masak> if it were, then .chars would be hanging loose ;)

[13:45] <leont> The ticket was https://rt.perl.org//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130520

[13:45] <timotimo> and not making sure what exactly gets flattened

[13:45] <masak> er, I mean .ords

[13:45] <timotimo> i.e. it could be flat.map or .map.flat

[13:46] <timotimo> or it could be a deeply recursively flattening version of map

[13:46] <leont> "it does the thing the other perl's map does"

[13:46] <timotimo> we don't target exclusively perl programmers

[13:47] <leont> True. But I would argue it's the perlish map

[13:47] *** lucasb left
[13:48] <Juerd> What does "the perlish" mean, in a timtowtdi landscape?

[13:48] <timotimo> but that's just because perl doesn't have nested arrays

[13:49] <timotimo> FSVO "doesn't have"

[13:49] <leont> It has nested arrays, it doesn't have nested lists ;-)

[13:49] <tadzik> what about .5map()? /me hides

[13:49] <timotimo> i don't think we allow method names starting with numbers unless you quote

[13:50] <leont> Also, I'm rather worried how a feature got deprecated in a discussion involving only 4 people.

[13:50] <leont> That sort of thing really ought to involve a bigger segment of the community

[13:50] <timotimo> i was fine with that without saying so explicitly

[13:51] <timotimo> also there's more people in the github issue linked to at the end

[13:52] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: I agree with you with almost everything you sad on your blog post. I only disagree with having 2 different rakudo. And I think that Zoffix cannot be blamed of being proactive, he just though something different from you (probably the same I was thinking before reading your post. Myself, I changed half of perl6 mentions, on Red GitHub page, to Raku) (forgiveness > permission)

[15:27] <benjikun> if so, I wasn't alive heh ;)

[15:27] *** dogbert17 left
[15:27] <El_Che> and we are having civil war about an alias

[15:27] <El_Che> we suck at a lot more than marketing

[15:28] <benjikun> oh wow, didn't expect that

[15:29] <El_Che> take tiobe with a grain of salt, but still: 

[15:29] <El_Che> https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

[15:29] <benjikun> to be fair to matlab, most alternatives suck (e.g. octave)

[15:29] <El_Che> benjikun: it is a very nich langauge

[15:29] <El_Che> not a all-around one like perl

[15:29] <benjikun> Ye

[15:29] <El_Che> same with assembly

[15:30] <holyghost> I'm going to do my gest to cope wit matlab and mathematica

[15:30] <El_Che> It seems Ruby is in the same boat

[15:30] <benjikun> I'm attempting to completely avoid mathematica

[15:31] <holyghost> s/gest/best

[15:31] <El_Che> oh, and "Perl" is Perl 5 and 6 on tiobe

[15:31] <benjikun> I sometimes use Maxima as a CAS when I need one

[15:32] <Altreus> so what was life like when perl5 replaced perl4?

[15:32] <leont> Being king of the hill isn't healthy either

[15:32] <El_Che> leont: tell that to van Rossum :)

[15:32] <leont> We were king around 2000, later is was php, then ruby, now javascript/node

[15:33] <El_Che> leont: the problem in not not being a major language anymore, the problem is the ever declining popularity

[15:33] <mst> yeah, being king of the hill results in the hordes of barbarians who make a mess

[15:33] <El_Che> leont: python seems to be the kind

[15:33] <El_Che> g

[15:33] <leont> Python never was king, that's their strengh

[15:33] <El_Che> mst: funny, when you said barbarian I thought of you and braveheart :)

[15:34] <mst> El_Che: http://trout.me.uk/facepalm2.jpg

[15:34] <leont> They were never a hype, they just slowly conquered the countryside without hyping

[15:34] <El_Che> leont: much like Trump? :)

[15:34] <benjikun> Yeah python has had a pretty steady growth

[15:34] <benjikun> Perl has had a steady decline, sadly

[15:37] <leont> Everything that got hyped got poisoned with by what mst just called barbarians.

[15:37] <leont> Programmers in the wrong Donning-Kruger quadrant tend to flock to the most popular languages.

[15:37] <El_Che> leont: that is not our problem anymore :)

[15:38] <leont> Perl from around 2000 wasn't so good on average, php got that flock with well known result. Ruby got it later and apparently now "Ruby is dead" (it isn't of course).

[15:38] <pmurias> El_Che: do you seriously think it's about the alias not a gradual rename?

[15:38] <leont> And I don't even want to think too long about what's happening in node

[15:38] <El_Che> pmurias: yes, as people that hate it can still use Perl 6

[15:39] <benjikun> PHP is a monstrosity that was in the right place at the right time

[15:39] <mst> pmurias: I think it's about letting it shake out, I'd rather like "raku perl" to end up being what most people call it

[15:39] <El_Che> pmurias: after a while the renaming discussion will come back again

[15:39] <El_Che> and again

[15:39] <mst> pmurias: but waiting for language to evolve how it's going to evolve is a better approach than trying to enforce it top down

[15:39] <El_Che> because an alias does not fix the problem of Perl 5 people while reducing Perl 6's image to 1998's Perl

[15:40] <mst> even if, inevitably, the people who think they're going to lose see it as it being enforced top down

[15:47] <leont> Being a hype means you only can go down. The question for perl5 is how to you go down without losing vitality. And for perl 6 it's how to go up in a sustainable way.

[15:47] <pmurias> mst: not try to push inside "official" places before that by annoying everyone with backhanded tactics

[15:47] <marcusr> I get the same p6doc error in docker as well, but also realized the latest docker container is also 2018.06

[15:48] <mst> y'know, from outside of perl6, the way it was added to the perl6.org docs got commented on by a lot of people as being a very mature, low drama way of introducing the world to it without making a big deal out of it

[15:56] <mst> be a shame to spoil that appearance

[15:56] * pmurias looks

[15:57] <Zoffix> pmurias: the messaging has consistently been that Group A says "new name is beneficial" and Group B says "Perl 6 name is beneficial" and if we create the alias the two groups can use both names and if the claims of Group A are true, we'll see them

[15:59] <Zoffix> pmurias: and I don't remember the wording of what I said on leaving it for 3-8 months, but my point was is we let the users and 3rd party outlets use the alias to ****judge how successful it is**** and organically see how much it should be used in official channels instead of trying to inorganically force its use into everything.

[16:02] <El_Che> pmurias: yes, mst's is a okayish compromise

[16:02] <Zoffix> pmurias: two primary things: the argumentation that Perl 6 > Perl 5, which makes Perl 5 community our enemies and makes us do more effort to promote our language, since we have to counteract the "Perl 6 is a failure/dead" coming from upset Perl 5 users. And the second one that I care more about is that the plan going forward is to do nothing really (woolfy's talk said write blogs etc, but that's a given and

[16:02] <Zoffix> ammounts to "nothing") other than to continuously correct people who talk shit about Perl. 

[16:02] *** pmurias left
[16:02] <mst> El_Che: if we can get as far as "${name} perl" for perl5 as well we can just declare the 28/30/etc. to be the major version of "${name} perl" and escape the trap without any need for more stupid-ass shitting on perl6 from our camp

[16:02] <El_Che> pmurias: in my view the solution would be leaving Perl to Perl 5 and rename Perl 6 so it can stand on its own merits. But that's not happening, so mst's idea is not bad

[16:03] <Zoffix> pmurias: and my counterargument to that second part is we've already been doing it since Christmas 2015 and IMO it's not working. So saying just keep doing it and one day it'll probably work is insufficient for me as a resolution.

[16:03] <pmurias> Zoffix: the Perl 6 > Perl 5 part sucks

[16:04] <El_Che> pmurias: that's the reason why I appreciate mst's and Zoffix's efforts. It's *far* from perfect, but I starts from a real problem.

[16:04] <mst> that's why I like the idea of reframing it as "the sixth perl larry designed" versus "the fifth perl larry designed"

[16:04] <Zoffix> But more importantly, IMO woolfy/lizmat's plan is not annulled by the alias plan: they can continue to use "Perl 6" and improve Perl's image and it will benefit both us and the Perl 5 folks.

[16:04] <El_Che> pmurias: it is a given both will piss off many people, but every single action will by now, including doing nothing at all

[16:05] <El_Che> mst: I would not use version numbers in the narrative, though :)

[16:05] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[16:06] <mst> El_Che: no. but using that description to explain the *origin* I think works

[16:07] <pmurias> Zoffix: waiting to see if Raku pick ups before using it in official channels would work too

[16:07] <El_Che> P5 loss of popularity and reputation will not be fixed by the liberation of a major version number (so it can go to 7 or 30 or whatver), but it will not be the reason for anonimosity between both sub communities

[16:09] <Zoffix> pmurias: I'm +1 on that. I know I've included "Raku Perl 6" on release brochure, but as I mentioned it earlier, I felt that was required because of the 1.5yr plan to finalize the decision on whether we'll have the alias and not having it in there would leave that question unanswered. I also added "Raku" to the Glossary. I think that's more than sufficient for right now.

[16:09] <Zoffix> Ideally, TimToady would write a detailed blog post describing the appropriate uses of the alias.

[16:10] <El_Che> TimToady: I hope you're not reading this and we are not spoiling your vacation

[16:10] <Zoffix> TimToady is omniscient. He reads everything the second it happens.

[16:10] <El_Che> from far we must look like children screaming "wait until dad come home, you'll see!"

[16:11] <El_Che> Zoffix: that's why he needs a vacation, probably

[17:10] <leont> What does «%*ENV values are allomorphic» mean?

[17:11] <timotimo> allomorphs are things like IntStr

[17:12] *** harrison left
[17:12] <timotimo> as you can see it remembers its original string representation

[17:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b93ec9f5: OUTPUT: «IntStr.new(297, "0b100101001")␤»

[17:12] <timotimo> since the environment variables api isn't typed, we mustn't destroy the original string data by parsing them as an int, for example

[17:12] <leont> Ah. Yeah that's useful, but not clear at all

[17:13] <timotimo> https://docs.perl6.org/language/glossary#index-entry-Allomorph

[17:13] <timotimo> a quick search in the docs clears it up, fortunately

[17:13] <timotimo> maybe some terms in that brochure should be hyperlinks to the glossary?

[17:14] <leont> Yeah, that would help a lot

[17:14] <timotimo> i'd expect the right issue tracker for that to be the marketing repo under the perl6 org

[19:09] <Woodi> hi today :)

[19:10] <masak> hi Wooday

[19:12] <Woodi> SmokeMachine: lot's of work in Red :)  just a lot of methods with ^, I thinked ^ is only for meta-language stuff... also some examples with error handling would be nice

[19:13] <timotimo> the metaclass is also just a class, so you can derive from it and add more methods

[19:14] <Woodi> timotimo: I mean that in Red synopis all db calls looks ^...

[19:15] <SmokeMachine> Woodi: The intention was not adding methods on "your" class... so I added those on the metaclass...

[19:15] *** xenowoolfy joined
[19:16] <SmokeMachine> Woodi: had you taken a look at the examples and at the wiki?

[19:16] <SmokeMachine> Woodi: and more important: are you liking Red?

[19:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v xenowoolfy

[19:16] <Woodi> just github code tree

[19:16] <leont> Honestly, that changelog is more confusing than enlightening.

[19:17] <leont> Half of them leave me with questions about what changed

[19:17] <Woodi> SmokeMachine: where is wiki ?

[19:17] <SmokeMachine> at github...

[19:17] <leont> Some I can figure out by looking up things, but that really shouldn't be necessary.

[19:18] <SmokeMachine> Woodi: https://github.com/FCO/Red/wiki

[19:18] <Woodi> ah, there it is...

[19:18] <leont> «require'd symbols no longer transitively exposed» that's not helpful at all. Why can't that explain what it means? Why can't it give an example.

[19:18] <SmokeMachine> Woodi: and the examples are: https://github.com/FCO/Red/tree/master/examples

[19:19] <xenowoolfy> At the Amsterdam Perl Mongers meeting tonight. With 16 people, watching now a presentation by AndrewShitov about how to build a compiler in Perl 6. Cool.

[19:19] <timotimo> very cool

[19:19] <Woodi> hi xenowoolfy :)

[19:20] <SmokeMachine> xenowoolfy: is that being recorded?

[19:20] <xenowoolfy> SmokeMachine: no...  this is just a mongers meeting, very informal...

[19:21] <leont> «Multi-dimensional access via {…}, similar to how it works with […]» that doesn't help either

[19:21] <Woodi> SmokeMachine: overall api usage looks "fast", few calls and all data saved in db

[19:21] <SmokeMachine> xenowoolfy: :( I am playing with something like that (https://github.com/FCO/bernalang)... so wotch that could help me...

[19:33] <robertle> there anything specific you don't like about phpBB? rewriting for the sake of rewriting seems a bit tedious

[19:34] <Woodi> robertle: in my opinion it is garanteed that it have serious bugs. BIND-style - always bugged

[19:34] <El_Che> It looks like everyone started to write blogs

[19:34] <El_Che> just saw the link of the one of virtualsue and now one from stmuk

[19:36] <robertle> Woodi: I guess the whoel async-comms-threads idea needs a fresh look, rather than just a revamp in another language. I wouldn't know what that could be though

[19:36] <El_Che> mst: you called virtualsue's post a little cranky? stmuk asks to hold his beer :)

[19:36] <Woodi> robertle: but actualy my intent was to have Perl[56] app everybody installs :)

[19:36] <mst> El_Che: I liked stmuk's, hence my comment

[19:36] <El_Che> mst: I missed that on the backlog, I thought you meant virtaulsue's

[19:37] <mst> El_Che: in the backlog I did. stmuk's I commented *on reddit*

[19:37] <El_Che> ah ok, not there yet

[19:37] <mst> robertle: I have looked at the phpBB source code.

[19:37] <El_Che> wait, you and stmuk agreed on something?

[19:42] <robertle> Woodi: I didn't mean to do something more real-time, but a different way to organize non-realtime discussions. there was a really nice post a long tima go by someone (can't remember) about visual patterns of email threads. basically it had the ping-pong pattern, the one post-100-replies and so on

[19:43] <robertle> I think it drove home that a tree of responses isn't actually a good way for more than a very few people to have a conversation. so perhaps it needs something completely different. posts that float in space and you can link them to other posts with edges that "support" the other post, "oppose", "add to" and so on

[19:44] <robertle> you could then start clustering the posts in some form, and navigate along these links

[19:53] <jmerelo> xenowoolfy: you would never ruin my mood :-)

[19:54] <xenowoolfy> Oh yes I would...

[19:54] <jmerelo> xenowoolfy: if you try of course. But not by pointing me to stuff to get myself informed.

[19:55] <jmerelo> I mean, lizmat's post has been very clarifying

[19:55] <xenowoolfy> Ok

[19:55] <jmerelo> And might I point everyone to this issue: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1847

[19:56] <jmerelo> There's been some stuff here I don't particularly like, like people deleting issues or attacking other people in issues.

[19:56] <jmerelo> Clearly, the default "being civil" CoC we assume in Perl has not been followed. We should have had a CoC to deal with this kind of things. 

[19:57] <jmerelo> Plus the will to enforce it, of course.

[23:24] <jdv79> it even made it to the top of hackernews.

[23:26] <timotimo> fantastic, there was a screencast!

[23:32] <Xliff> (timo x 2): Aside from jnthn, who else is good with NativeCall issues?

[23:32] <Xliff> m: (1 x 2).say;

[23:33] <Xliff> m: say "abcdef".comb.join('').reverse;

[23:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b93ec9f5: OUTPUT: «(abcdef)␤»

[23:33] <Xliff> m: say "abcdef".comb.reverse.join('');

[23:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8b93ec9f5: OUTPUT: «fedcba␤»

[23:34] <Xliff> m: sub pali ($a) { $a ~ $a.comb.reverse.join('') }; say pali(0b1001010.Str)

[23:34] <Xliff> LOL!

[23:43] <sjn> also, calling a method with a Str-casted binary number as argument is just evil :)

[23:48] <timotimo> you don't have to .Str it there, though?
