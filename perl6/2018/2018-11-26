[03:01] <holyghost> perl6 sound software, here I come !

[03:01] <yoleaux> 25 Nov 2018 17:05Z <jmerelo> holyghost: nobody removed you from the schedule, you were never actually there. If you want to write something, please use some repo to publish and we'll review it before accepting.

[03:02] <lookatme_q> what is sound software ?

[03:03] <holyghost> I am programming a search for a pattern in the nth channel

[03:05] <holyghost> I use a matrix to interpolate the 8bit channels in a WAV file, then I have larger numbers to compare for the search of a sample/pattern

[03:06] <holyghost> Later on I'll do effects

[03:06] <holyghost> all from the command line

[03:06] <holyghost> on e.g. aiff/wave file samples

[03:08] <holyghost> The biggest thing would be to rip a voice from a WAVE file

[03:08] <holyghost> Then when I have my voice or other samples on disk, I can use them to make new music in a sound editor

[03:10] <lookatme_q> Play a WAV file ?

[03:10] <holyghost> ?

[03:11] <holyghost> I reap WAV files then sort out patterns in the WAV file, them write those samples to disk, then I can as you say play the WAV file

[03:11] <lookatme_q> Do you mean you make a command tools can make new music ?

[03:11] <holyghost> yes

[03:11] <lookatme_q> oh

[03:12] <holyghost> then do effects on the sample WAV file

[03:13] <holyghost> then with the pieces/samples in WAV files I can edit in a wave editor and mix

[03:13] <holyghost> I might make a player too

[03:14] <lookatme_q> Have you finish it yet?

[03:14] <holyghost> no

[03:14] <lookatme_q> Cool work

[03:14] <holyghost> thanks :-)

[10:22] <timotimo> hey Xliff 

[10:22] <Xliff> Oh, hey!

[10:22] <jkramer> Shouldn't this work?

[10:23] <Xliff> timotimo: I am having a weird issue with Cairo. I had an example that was working a few weeks ago, but now it is not.

[10:23] <timotimo> jkramer: i think you're running into the problem that xx thunks its LHS

[10:23] <timotimo> Xliff: oh, that sounds interesting

[10:23] <Xliff> timotimo: Tracked it to here -> https://github.com/timo/cairo-p6/blob/master/lib/Cairo.pm6#L1250. Error message is "Cannot modify an immutable Operator (OPERATOR_OVER)

[10:23] <Xliff> " 

[10:23] <timotimo> ah!

[10:24] <timotimo> all those proxy returning methods require an "is rw"

[10:24] <Xliff> Subtle change in rakudo? I can't see anything in Cairo's commit log that cause this.

[10:24] <timotimo> let me handle that real quick

[10:24] <Xliff> LOL! Thanks!

[10:24] <timotimo> yeah, it was a bug in rakudo that was discovered long ago, but we decided to be bug-compatible for a while

[10:25] <Xliff> Heh.

[10:26] <timotimo> pushed to github

[10:27] <Xliff> Thanks!

[10:28] <Xliff> Bump version?

[10:28] <timotimo> yeah

[10:29] <timotimo> bumped

[10:29] <Xliff> :)

[10:30] <Xliff> Yeah, so it's official. My GTK monster is now using your module as a dependency.

[10:30] <Xliff> Next thing is to tackle Pango.

[10:30] <timotimo> yeah, someone else also asked for being able to render multi-line strings with cairo

[10:30] <timotimo> oh, btw

[10:30] <timotimo> there is a way to render two lines of text with cairo

[10:31] <timotimo> actually, any amount of lines of text is possible

[10:31] *** vike1 left
[10:31] <timotimo> a friend found this out recently

[10:31] <Xliff> Neat!

[10:31] <timotimo> you can put <span></span> elements in your text

[10:31] <Xliff> Not surprising with the push to CSS and markups from Gnome

[10:31] <timotimo> all you need to do is give every letter its own span, give them correctly calculated horizontal offsets and vertical offsets and then just put the letters of all lines next to each other

[10:32] <timotimo> so the text would be "hweolrldo" instead of "hello" and "world"

[10:32] <Xliff> Yeeks! That sounds like a lot of CSS!

[10:32] *** vike joined
[10:32] <timotimo> yeah

[10:32] <timotimo> it's not workable in practice, of course :)

[10:32] <Xliff> Still neat though.

[12:08] <timotimo> if it's on the ecosystem, i.e. github or similar, zef will always install from the latest master commit anyway, though i think maybe it won't until the version was bumped?

[16:34] <Xliff> Here's something interesting from a perl6-gdb-m backtrace. The answer to the imposed question is most assuredly: "YES"

[16:34] <Xliff> https://gist.github.com/Xliff/600d6e0baaa1e2305132b23d9f4c05f6

[16:35] <Xliff> Still looking for how I can figure out what caused the problem.

[16:36] <timotimo> Xliff: this is with the jit enabled?

[16:36] <Xliff> Yep.

[16:36] <Xliff> Want me to rerun with it off?

[16:36] <timotimo> yes

[16:36] <timotimo> the jit messes up stack traces

[16:37] <timotimo> null_args_callsite and inv_arg_callsite aren't functions, they're constants. the instruction pointer isn't supposed to land in them

[16:37] <timotimo> and it doesn't

[16:37] <timotimo> it's just that the stack isn't in a format that gdb expects

[16:37] <Xliff> Yeah. I was getting floating segfault in this code. 

[16:38] <Xliff> I figure it's something I'm doing with NativeCall, but it's making it hard to track.

[16:38] <timotimo> i seem to recall you tried valgrind already?

[16:38] <Xliff> Turning off the JIT has prevented many of the earlier ones, but I am still getting them later in the routine.

[16:39] <Xliff> Valgrind was for something related to CArray that I still haven't figured out yet. I did gist about it for a piece of test code I wrote.

[16:39] <Xliff> But this is something unrelated.

[16:40] <timotimo> OK

[16:41] <Xliff> OK. Updated with another segfault. This one is fairly common, but there is no tc.

[22:06] <Xliff> I'm getting a lot of these, lately. "MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler" -- Could this be due to exceptions in C code not being handled properly?

[22:06] *** kensanata left
[22:07] <timotimo> "impossible to handle", more like

[22:07] <Xliff> Well, shit.

[22:07] <Xliff> Whatever is happening, is happening in the C layer, and I can't trace it to any MoarVM code.

[22:08] <Xliff> Would be nice to know the last line executed, but I'm afraid its in a signal handler. I know what action causes the problem, though.

[22:13] <timotimo> what i tend to do is wrap every callback in a CATCH

[22:14] <timotimo> and since often enough the error that occurs is from binding arguments to the callback, i tend to give it a signature of |c first

[22:59] <Xliff> Is there any way to determine if I have a type object in a container?

[22:59] <Xliff> .defined does not seem to work.

[23:00] <[Coke]> DEFINITE?

[23:06] <Xliff> Nope. Didn't work.

[23:07] <Xliff> FWIW, I'm walking a linked list and most of the methods that I expect to work... havent.

[23:09] <lizmat> Xliff: well, if you've found bugs in Rakudo, please report them!

[23:10] <Xliff> lizmat: As soon as I've verified. I've reported bugs before, but I'm finding them in a very large project and no one wants to go through my bug reports due to the size. And I don't blame them.

[23:39] <Manifest0> Can someone explain why this works: perl6 -e 'my @array = (()); push @array[0],1; say @array; ' ? Shouldn't this be an array containing a immutable list?

[23:41] *** kurahaupo left
[23:41] *** ryn1x left
[23:43] <Manifest0> For example this doesn't work: perl6 -e 'my @array = ((), (), (), ()); push @array[0],1; say @array; '

[23:44] <leont> Because my @array = (()) creates an empty array

[23:44] <leont> my @array = ((),) will fail as you expect

[23:46] <Manifest0> () is an empty list. Shouldn't this be an array with an empty list?

[23:47] <Manifest0> The documentation states: "There is one exception, empty lists are created with just parenthesis"

[23:48] <timotimo> an array constructor will iterate its outermost thing passed

[23:48] <timotimo> which is also worth knowing

[23:48] <timotimo> m: my @array = (()); dd @array

[23:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7a82deb6e: OUTPUT: «Array @array = []␤»

[23:49] <timotimo> m: my @array = ((),); dd @array
