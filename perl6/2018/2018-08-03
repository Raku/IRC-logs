[02:32] <astj> Zoffix: thanx. so is there no recommendation about this?  if not I'll keep them as is.

[02:33] <Zoffix> astj: don't think there's any recommendation. It's simply just two different ecosystems. Well, three I guess, some people choose to host on GitLab instead of GitHub. Different tokes for different folks.

[02:33] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: "Unread notifications: 249" :)

[02:33] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: oh…

[04:28] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: fwiw you can check https://toast.perl6.party/ to see why toaster considered it to be failing

[04:29] <AlexDaniel> in this case it seems to be a missing library?

[04:29] <Xliff> OK. What's the best way to fix that, here?

[04:31] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: “describe what you did to install it and ensure that same instructions are present in the README file of the module” :)

[04:32] <Xliff> Does META6.json have a facility to allow specification of native dependencies?

[04:33] <AlexDaniel> not that I know of, unfortunately

[04:33] <AlexDaniel> also it's very platform-specific

[04:33] <AlexDaniel> although… maybe not

[04:33] <AlexDaniel> I mean, it's pretty universal to demand “libogg” library, be it libogg.so or something else

[04:34] <Xliff> Yeah. I'm going to add install instructions into README and insure it still installs.

[04:41] <Xliff> OK. Setup info added to README.md and all installs OK.

[09:07] <masak> public attrs are readonly by default (aka "the public accessor method generated for the actual (private) attr is an rvalue by default")

[09:07] <Xliff> masak++

[09:09] <Xliff> masak: What's the basic use case for trait:handles?

[09:09] <masak> in a word, delegation

[09:09] <Xliff> Yeah, I get that.

[09:09] <masak> but I imagine, since you're asking, that short answer doesn't help much :)

[09:10] <Xliff> Not really. I think I get it, but sometimes it's better to see a useful example, rather than something basic, like what is shown in the docs.

[09:10] <masak> let's just say there's a style of OO programming based around composition and delegation for which `handles` greatly helps avoiding writing out very repetitive methods that only delegate to the wrapped object in the obvious way

[09:10] <Xliff> So...

[09:11] <masak> m: class Motor { method start { say "wrooom" } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; Car.new.start

[09:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0ac427612: OUTPUT: «wrooom␤»

[09:11] <masak> I didn't have to write `method start { $.motor.start }`

[09:11] <Xliff> I was about to say just that. Thanks!

[09:11] <masak> and that advantage only grows, the more you rely on composition and delegation

[09:13] <Xliff> And that prevents unnecessary complexity from trying to determine whether Motor is a class or a Role.

[09:14] <masak> it just needs to be something that typechecks

[09:14] <Xliff> masak++: That helps, thanks!

[09:15] <masak> hm, but my example wasn't super-realistic, I realize. because I accidentally relied on the Motor attribute working with a static method

[09:15] <scimon> So. I have been wondering how would I go about getting something like sub trait_mod:<requires>( Sub $s, :$auth [$type] ) { ... } (basically a trait that's not 'is' )

[09:15] <masak> m: class Motor { has $.sound; method start { say $.sound } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; my Motor $motor .= new(:sound("wroooom!")); Car(:$motor).new.start

[09:16] <masak> m: class Motor { has $.sound; method start { say $.sound } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; my Motor $motor .= new(:sound("wroooom!")); Car.new(:$motor).new.start

[09:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ab07c771: OUTPUT: «Cannot look up attributes in a Motor type object␤  in method sound at <tmp> line 1␤  in method start at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[09:16] <masak> m: class Motor { has $.sound; method start { say $.sound } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; my Motor $motor .= new(:sound("wroooom!")); Car.new(:$motor).start

[09:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ab07c771: OUTPUT: «wroooom!␤»

[09:16] <masak> :)

[09:16] <masak> Xliff: that's a more realistic (if slightly longer) example

[09:17] <masak> Xliff: you can probably spot the relationships here between stuff like composition/delegation and Dependency Injection

[09:18] <Xliff> Yes. I think I get it. I actually haven't looked into composition/delegation much, though.

[09:18] <Xliff> Probably why I didn't immediately get the concept.

[09:19] <masak> Xliff: everybody is raving about inheritance in OO, but inheritance is (IMHO) not such a strong idea. composition, on the other hand...

[09:21] <masak> inheritance is a weak idea because the dependency relationship between base class and deriving class (*especially* as those evolve over time, especially in the hands of different teams) becomes very tricky

[09:21] <scimon> Agreed

[09:22] <masak> actually, "tricky" is too vague of a term. it has a lot of inherent "risk", in the precise meaning that's connected with monetary losses and project failure

[09:23] <El_Che> masak: there is nothing more fun than subclassing without needing to think about the global design :)

[09:24] <masak> I have a long-standing theory that inheritance is popular mostly because it seems an obvious idea from the point of view of the "ambient" philosophy we're left with after Plato and Aristotle

[09:24] <masak> but they didn't say much about the risk :)

[09:25] <El_Che> ambient philosophy?

[09:27] <masak> I just mean the imprints that philosophy has made on the minds of people, even lots of people who may not have studied Plato and Aristotle directly, but only learned of it through some kind of cultural osmosis

[09:28] <masak> I mean, Plato said "there's the world of Ideas, and then there's the messy world of things that're based on those ideas". well, that's classes and instances for you.

[09:28] <masak> (paraphrased, by the way)

[09:29] <El_Che> well, Aristotle ware revived in the Middle Ages and gained influence in Western culture then. But what I know of him (mostly the part about rethorics) doesn't match that world view

[09:29] <El_Che> he's the man of maxima

[09:30] <El_Che> rules that can result in the desired result

[09:31] <El_Che> in rethorics I would see Aristotle more in the school of composition

[09:32] <masak> yes. also in the school of JavaScript's prototypes.

[09:33] <El_Che> adaptive programmig

[09:33] <El_Che> a succesful orator knows how to change his discourse to his target audience

[09:34] <El_Che> (from somewhere in the Poetics)

[09:36] <El_Che> "The whole is more than the sum of its parts." <-- sounds like composition to me :)

[09:37] <masak> as an occasional reductionist, I must protest

[09:37] <El_Che> hehehe

[09:38] <masak> if someone got more out of the parts than their sum, it might be because they're crap at addition

[09:38] <El_Che> "It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.", Aristotle before Christmas 2015

[09:38] <masak> yeah, pretty sure it was before

[09:38] <masak> didn't know Aristotle was big on platitudes, tho

[09:39] <El_Che> he's the king of the maxima we take for granted today

[09:39] <El_Che> logical maxima

[09:39] <El_Che> like the good of the many > good of the few

[09:40] <masak> do you mean "maxims"?

[09:40] <masak> "maxima" is the plural of "maximum"

[09:40] <El_Che>  maxima propositio 

[09:41] <masak> ah.

[09:41] <El_Che> there must be something left of those Latin year I had in high school :)

[09:41] <El_Che> axioma => maxima proposition

[09:41] <El_Che> (of course we all know axioma from math)

[11:04] <Xliff> Ah! Nevermind. I see it.

[11:05] <sena_kun> Xliff, you can push a PR which fixes tests, then mark the issue with `PR sent` and close. Also, IIRC MurmurHash is about native dependency: if I am not mistaken here, see if the README clearly states it, has  at least brief instructions on how to install the dependency, mark with `native dependency`, install/test, if everything is green - closing.

[11:23] <dpk> there's a bug where it joins channels before authing for some reason

[11:23] <Ulti> also this is all remarkably well organised!

[11:23] <dpk> so it doesn't manage to get into #perl6 because of +r

[11:23] <Zoffix> dpk: make it send the auth pass as password to the server and  that'll avoid that

[11:23] <dpk> so i have to make it manually issue the command until i can get round to fixing the bug

[11:23] <Zoffix> dpk: ah cool. We now removed +r so should be fine from now on

[11:24] <dpk> hmm, does that work on non-freenode networks?

[11:24] <Zoffix> dpk: no idea, but I know it works on freenode

[11:24] <dpk> well i'm not willing to add any Freenode-specific code, so i'll have to investigate before that

[11:24] <Zoffix> :)

[11:24] <dpk> but thanks for the tip

[11:25] <Zoffix> dpk: sorry, would you make it join #perl6-dev #moarvm too? Seems same issue existed there (and now the channels are no longer +r too)

[12:33] <jkramer> Should I close issues when the only problem is a failing dependency and I made a PR to fix the other module and closed the corresponding issue?

[12:33] <sena_kun> Ulti, if you cannot fix a complex module, yes, you can comment with a detailed error and that'd be an improvement. I think we can decide on what to do with such modules later, but the primary goal is to make work as many modules as we can, I think.

[12:34] <sena_kun> jkramer, try to install it with fixed dependency(it can be not always the only issue), if it works -> yes, label `failing dependency`, comment on `Foo is fixed now, closing`, and we're done.

[12:34] <El_Che> jkramer: I would leave ticker on the consuming module, so the author is aware the problem is there

[12:35] <jkramer> sena_kun: I did, it installs fine with the dependency installed

[12:35] <sena_kun> instructions say not to close such modules, but I think if it works now, then no issue present, really.

[12:35] <sena_kun> jkramer++

[12:36] <jkramer> Well it doesn't work YET (as in 'zef install' doesn't) because the PR to the dependency isn't merged yet

[12:37] <Ulti> sena_kun: yeah I think a good way to get things to work is just gentle prods too, when I've found some PR or issues in my modules I tend to actually fix what was broken plus do just a little bit more work whilst Im there too

[12:37] <Ulti> like last time someone prodded me about Stats I did some more work on functionality I've not yet pushed up

[12:40] <Ulti> hmmm an ecosystem bitrot service might not be a bad thing to build, so you can just register as an authority as being ok with spam about your modules being uninstallable

[12:41] <Ulti> like I was kind of shocked my module had stopped being installable and it was just a change to precision of how rats/nums got stringified and my test was badly written relying on stringification rather than numerically checking

[12:46] <Ulti> hmm does Travis and similar not have some kind of periodic checking functionality?

[12:46] <Ulti> feels like a genuinely missing piece

[12:46] <sena_kun> they check only commits afaik.

[12:47] <sena_kun> but we have https://toast.perl6.party/

[12:47] <sena_kun> which is awesome.

[13:16] <Zoffix> and I killed it then

[13:16] <El_Che> ZzZombo: someone forgot to disable emails from perl6 repos :)

[13:16] <El_Che> I did long time ago

[13:16] <ZzZombo> El_Che, it wasn't a problem before for me.

[13:17] <ZzZombo> I like to peek inside P6 activity once in a while.

[13:17] <El_Che> I look into the github notifications regularly

[13:17] <Zoffix> ZzZombo: sorry about that. When we did realize that people get notifications and emails it was already too late.

[13:23] <sena_kun> Odd. When installing with zef, I am getting an apparently new version of module(0.1.3), and it fails because of error. But this error was fixed a long-long ago and the version was bumped after it, to 0.1.3.

[13:24] <sena_kun> So I am getting latest version, but non-latest sources. o.0

[13:25] *** ChoHag left
[13:25] <Zoffix> sena_kun: which module?

[13:26] <sena_kun> MPD::Client.

[13:26] <sena_kun> zef install MPD::Client gives me(and toaster too) `Variable '$hits' is not declared`, but...

[13:27] <Zoffix> Xliff: yo. Can you set the https://temp.perl6.party/eco.png

[13:30] <Zoffix> sena_kun: BTW zef has `look` command `zef look MPD::Client`

[13:30] <sena_kun> Zoffix, well, that's because you don't have mpd installed & run.

[13:30] <sena_kun> so it's predictable. But I wonder what's wrong with this version difference.

[13:30] <Zoffix> Yeah, but wouldn't an error about undeclared variable be thrown before anything attempts to connect to anything?

[13:31] <sena_kun> it would, yes.

[13:31] <Zoffix> Yeah, if I do `zef look MPD::Client` I too get a version with a bunch of hits vars

[13:31] <sena_kun> Zoffix, you tried `zef install MPD::Client`, not clonned repo?

[13:32] <sena_kun> pizza afk&

[13:32] <jkramer> Should anything be done about deprecated/obsolete/abandoned modules (i.e. somehow have it removed from modules.perl6.org) or just close the issue with an appropriate comment?

[13:33] <Zoffix> sena_kun: when I clone the repo and do `grep -FIRn hits` I get nothing, but if I `zef look MPD::Client` and do the same, I get a bunch of matches

[14:16] <jkramer> AlexDaniel: I'm talking mostly about modules that should not be on modules.perl6.org anymore as they're obsolete/deprecated

[14:17] <sena_kun> jkramer, the issue is that such modules are not necessary to be deleted.

[14:17] <sena_kun> I mean, there may be some historical reasons.

[14:17] <sena_kun> Of course, I author wants, they can remove the module from ecosystem(I did it once, No Regrets(tm)), but it is not always the case.

[14:18] <MasterDuke> jkramer: there was a big discussion about that recently, i believe the end result was to leave them listed unless the author chooses to remove them

[14:18] <sena_kun> also, I wonder if we want to make squashable6 a bit more silent when I work. :>

[14:20] <jkramer> MasterDuke: I don't say we should remove them, I just think a label for those issues would be useful because there seems to be quite a few of those modules :) For now I just ping the author and close the issue

[15:06] <Zoffix> tyil: in https://toast.perl6.party/module?module=App::Assixt&commit=2018.06

[15:06] <tyil> thanks

[15:06] <Zoffix> tyil: it's listed as kill. So I think it wasn't a failure, but it just took more than 10m to install (with all the deps) and got killed

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> it did install in my run: https://toast.6lang.org/module?module=App::Assixt&commit=2018.06

[15:10] <moritz> is there an easy way to find out if one of my modules has bitrotted?

[15:10] <timotimo> moritz: travis offers "cronjob" build schedules

[15:11] <moritz> that involves looking at every module, which doesn't quite meet my standard of "easy"

[15:12] <tyil> travis will email you when the cron fails as well I think

[15:12] <timotimo> yes

[15:12] <tyil> so you'll get notifications in your mailbox when it happens

[15:12] <timotimo> correct

[15:12] <moritz> but it means I have to set up travis for all modules in the first place

[15:12] <El_Che> moritz: I have some idea about that, I'll work on that when I have time. In the backlog for now :)

[15:13] <timotimo> setting up travis testing could be a goal in the unbitrot squashathon, too

[15:13] <timotimo> something volunteers can help with

[15:13] <timotimo> needs a bit more guidance, i'm sure

[15:13] <tyil> I mainly use gitlab now, there it's just adding a yml file to the repo

[15:14] <tyil> travis requires manual clicking labour to set up new projects

[15:23] <atroxaper> I know it is not a best time for questions, but... In Java world a class can have ‘ThreadLocal’ attribute. It means the attribute of an object of such class will has a value for an each thread. Can I have something similar in Perl 6? Maybe not as a class attribute, but in form of ‘special’ global storage. If I will use %!storage{$*THREAD.id} then I will face a garbage issue cause I cannot know when a thread has gone. Or can I?

[15:24] <timotimo> atroxaper: the ThreadPoolScheduler currently doesn't quit threads

[15:24] <Zoffix> atroxaper: I think %!storage{$*THREAD.id} is not threadsafe, because you're autovivifying keys there from multiple threads.

[15:25] <timotimo> that's also true

[15:25] <atroxaper> timotimo: i can make a thread by hand, but not by thread pool

[15:25] <timotimo> that's right

[15:26] <moritz> atroxaper: Perl 6 programs tend to not interface much with threads directly, so it's not a high priority; but I can see it as a useful feature for lower-level stuff

[15:26] <atroxaper> It means there is no solution 'out of the box'?

[15:27] <moritz> if you launch threads yourself, you can subclass Thread, and put a storage attribute in there

[15:27] <Zoffix> lizmat: I just got a SEGV with your word script

[15:27] <timotimo> well, i mean, there's NativeCall and pthread :)

[15:28] <lizmat> Zoffix: repeatedly?  :-(

[15:28] <moritz> class ThreadWithStorage is Thread { has $.local-storage }

[15:28] <moritz> and then access $*THREAD.local-storage

[15:28] <moritz> maybe default it to an empty hash

[15:28] <timotimo> also, $*THREAD does role { has $.local-storage }

[15:29] <Zoffix> lizmat: no, happened the first time I ran it and it didn't happen more than that

[15:29] <lizmat> Zoffix: I thoight we could reliably read from a hash from multiple threads even if we make changes to the hash ?

[15:29] <lizmat> timotimo: or deletes ?

[15:30] <atroxaper> moritz: Actually I write a lib. There is Log4j logging library in Java.

[17:03] <squashable6> 🍕 lizmat++ labeled issue “Coroutines” (broken beyond repair): https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/262

[17:03] <xinming> Is it possible to speciffy function to either return Str or Hash?

[17:04] <timotimo> yes, but is it useful?

[17:04] <xinming> something like  sub abc returns (Str|Hash) { ... }

[17:04] <xinming> for some json, the old code uses return and decode manually,

[17:05] <xinming> Later, add option :decode, So, it'll either return Str or Hash

[17:05] <timotimo> sounds like you want a multi sub :)

[17:05] <xinming> m: sub abc returns (Str|Any) { False ?? "1" !! 123 }; abc.say;

[17:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed trait␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3sub abc returns7⏏5 (Str|Any) { False ?? "1" !! 123 }; abc.␤»

[17:05] <Zoffix> xinming: yeah, but you gotta use a subset

[17:05] <Zoffix> m: subset Ret where Str|Hash; sub abc(--> Ret) { 42 }; abc

[17:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: OUTPUT: «Type check failed for return value; expected Ret but got Int (42)␤  in sub abc at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[17:05] <Zoffix> m: subset Ret where Str|Hash; sub abc(--> Ret) { "x" }; abc

[17:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: ( no output )

[17:05] <xinming> ok, got it

[17:05] <Zoffix> xinming: at least for now. I imagine in the future you'll be able to specify that directly inside

[17:06] <xinming> actually, I know I can do multi sub, Why I asked here is, wether design will allow anonymous return type junctions. :-)

[17:20] <xinming> I get method calliing recursion

[17:20] <AlexDaniel> that's correct, we focus on many things

[17:20] <lizmat> xinming: short answer: make it :$decode!

[17:21] <lizmat> and possibly make that candidate occur *before* the other one

[17:22] <lizmat> named parameters are not taken into account in MMD, unless they are obligatory, and then only when tie-breaking is needed

[19:56] <DrForr> Yeah, I'm still targeting a few places over there, and I'm also expecting to talk with a bunch of people at TPCiG which will lead to more stuff. I'm just going to keep myself flexible, though tugging around a large bag of long-term necessities won't help; maybe I can ask someone to hold onto that for a few weeks.

[21:53] <sena_kun> that's great, though I already saw that. :)

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: cool, so what do we do? :)

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: we have 25-ish tickets marked as `native dependency`

[21:55] <sena_kun> eeh, should we do something... I might have skimmed over it too fast, maybe. can you please clarify to a dead-brainer?

[21:56] <sena_kun> we have approximately 70 according to my list.

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I'm thinking we should send PRs for missing native dependencies

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: I'm currently working on a script to modify issue texts… I was doing it because of a misspelling, but we can use it to tweak the instructions for native deps

[22:02] <sena_kun> for next unbitrotting? or do you want to redo issue repo?

[22:02] <sena_kun> *entirely

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: for this one. No need to redo it, my script will just tweak the instructions in existing tickets

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: and we'll have to reopen 25 issues, yes

[22:03] <sena_kun> oh, then fine.

[22:03] <sena_kun> also, is this feature with natives is good enough?

[22:03] <sena_kun> I mean, how does it handle e.g. different GNU/Linux distributions?

[22:04] <sena_kun> >Maybe one day we will figure out a way to resolve versions for native/bin dependencies, possibly via backends/plugins that access e.g. apt-get ( although this related more to the previously mentioned dependency hints ).

[22:05] <sena_kun> so it cannot do that yet. then I don't see how is it, hmm, well, it is clearly better, but still.

[22:45] <AlexDaniel> but it should use a fallback if it can't find the emoji in your current font

[22:46] <daemon> hexchat falls back to ascii blocks if it cannot find a match

[22:46] <daemon> that is a small [ ] with 4 digits in it representing the char

[22:46] <daemon> which really does not work well for utf stuff

[22:47] <AlexDaniel> it should be 6 digits :)

[22:48] <daemon> legacy all the way https://i.itsosticky.com/1eg588q.png

[22:50] <daemon> one thing I never got to grips with

[22:50] <daemon> in truth I never really got to grips with vim, vi yes vim not so much

[22:50] <daemon> so I likely use it a touch less efficiently than is possible

[22:51] <benjikun> why?

[22:51] <daemon> because I grown up with ee and vi

[22:51] <daemon> they just seem more natural to me

[22:51] <benjikun> I see

[22:52] <daemon> that being said ... pico was a fork of ee and nano is a fork of pico

[22:52] <daemon> likewise vim is an extension of vi

[22:52] <daemon> so I guess all is as should be :P

[22:54] <benjikun> I just use vim now

[22:54] <benjikun> The only others I've really used (in terminal that is) are joe and nano

[22:54] <daemon> ah I tried joe a ... what seems like a lifetime ago

[22:55] <daemon> cannot even remember what it was like, so most likely did not get on with it lol

[22:55] <daemon> the worst experience in my life was using ed to fix a simple config file
