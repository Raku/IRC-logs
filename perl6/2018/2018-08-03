[09:07] <masak> public attrs are readonly by default (aka "the public accessor method generated for the actual (private) attr is an rvalue by default")

[09:07] <Xliff> masak++

[09:09] <Xliff> masak: What's the basic use case for trait:handles?

[09:09] <masak> in a word, delegation

[09:09] <Xliff> Yeah, I get that.

[09:09] <masak> but I imagine, since you're asking, that short answer doesn't help much :)

[09:10] <Xliff> Not really. I think I get it, but sometimes it's better to see a useful example, rather than something basic, like what is shown in the docs.

[09:10] <masak> let's just say there's a style of OO programming based around composition and delegation for which `handles` greatly helps avoiding writing out very repetitive methods that only delegate to the wrapped object in the obvious way

[09:10] <Xliff> So...

[09:11] <masak> m: class Motor { method start { say "wrooom" } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; Car.new.start

[09:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0ac427612: OUTPUT: ¬´wrooom‚ê§¬ª

[09:11] <masak> I didn't have to write `method start { $.motor.start }`

[09:11] <Xliff> I was about to say just that. Thanks!

[09:11] <masak> and that advantage only grows, the more you rely on composition and delegation

[09:13] <Xliff> And that prevents unnecessary complexity from trying to determine whether Motor is a class or a Role.

[09:14] <masak> it just needs to be something that typechecks

[09:14] <Xliff> masak++: That helps, thanks!

[09:15] <masak> hm, but my example wasn't super-realistic, I realize. because I accidentally relied on the Motor attribute working with a static method

[09:15] <scimon> So. I have been wondering how would I go about getting something like sub trait_mod:<requires>( Sub $s, :$auth [$type] ) { ... } (basically a trait that's not 'is' )

[09:15] <masak> m: class Motor { has $.sound; method start { say $.sound } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; my Motor $motor .= new(:sound("wroooom!")); Car(:$motor).new.start

[09:16] <masak> m: class Motor { has $.sound; method start { say $.sound } }; class Car { has Motor $.motor handles <start> }; my Motor $motor .= new(:sound("wroooom!")); Car.new(:$motor).new.start

[09:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ab07c771: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot look up attributes in a Motor type object‚ê§  in method sound at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in method start at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[09:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1ab07c771: OUTPUT: ¬´wroooom!‚ê§¬ª

[09:16] <masak> :)

[09:16] <masak> Xliff: that's a more realistic (if slightly longer) example

[09:17] <masak> Xliff: you can probably spot the relationships here between stuff like composition/delegation and Dependency Injection

[09:18] <Xliff> Yes. I think I get it. I actually haven't looked into composition/delegation much, though.

[09:18] <Xliff> Probably why I didn't immediately get the concept.

[09:19] <masak> Xliff: everybody is raving about inheritance in OO, but inheritance is (IMHO) not such a strong idea. composition, on the other hand...

[09:21] <masak> inheritance is a weak idea because the dependency relationship between base class and deriving class (*especially* as those evolve over time, especially in the hands of different teams) becomes very tricky

[09:21] <scimon> Agreed

[09:22] <masak> actually, "tricky" is too vague of a term. it has a lot of inherent "risk", in the precise meaning that's connected with monetary losses and project failure

[09:23] <El_Che> masak: there is nothing more fun than subclassing without needing to think about the global design :)

[09:24] <masak> I have a long-standing theory that inheritance is popular mostly because it seems an obvious idea from the point of view of the "ambient" philosophy we're left with after Plato and Aristotle

[09:24] <masak> but they didn't say much about the risk :)

[09:25] <El_Che> ambient philosophy?

[09:27] <masak> I just mean the imprints that philosophy has made on the minds of people, even lots of people who may not have studied Plato and Aristotle directly, but only learned of it through some kind of cultural osmosis

[09:28] <masak> I mean, Plato said "there's the world of Ideas, and then there's the messy world of things that're based on those ideas". well, that's classes and instances for you.

[09:28] <masak> (paraphrased, by the way)

[09:29] <El_Che> well, Aristotle ware revived in the Middle Ages and gained influence in Western culture then. But what I know of him (mostly the part about rethorics) doesn't match that world view

[09:29] <El_Che> he's the man of maxima

[09:30] <El_Che> rules that can result in the desired result

[09:31] <El_Che> in rethorics I would see Aristotle more in the school of composition

[09:32] <masak> yes. also in the school of JavaScript's prototypes.

[09:33] <El_Che> adaptive programmig

[09:33] <El_Che> a succesful orator knows how to change his discourse to his target audience

[09:34] <El_Che> (from somewhere in the Poetics)

[09:36] <El_Che> "The whole is more than the sum of its parts." <-- sounds like composition to me :)

[09:37] <masak> as an occasional reductionist, I must protest

[09:37] <El_Che> hehehe

[09:38] <masak> if someone got more out of the parts than their sum, it might be because they're crap at addition

[09:38] <El_Che> "It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.", Aristotle before Christmas 2015

[09:38] <masak> yeah, pretty sure it was before

[09:38] <masak> didn't know Aristotle was big on platitudes, tho

[09:39] <El_Che> he's the king of the maxima we take for granted today

[09:39] <El_Che> logical maxima

[09:39] <El_Che> like the good of the many > good of the few

[09:40] <masak> do you mean "maxims"?

[09:40] <masak> "maxima" is the plural of "maximum"

[09:40] <El_Che>  maxima propositio 

[09:41] <masak> ah.

[09:41] <El_Che> there must be something left of those Latin year I had in high school :)

[09:41] <El_Che> axioma => maxima proposition

[09:41] <El_Che> (of course we all know axioma from math)

[11:05] <sena_kun> Xliff, you can push a PR which fixes tests, then mark the issue with `PR sent` and close. Also, IIRC MurmurHash is about native dependency: if I am not mistaken here, see if the README clearly states it, has  at least brief instructions on how to install the dependency, mark with `native dependency`, install/test, if everything is green - closing.

[11:23] <dpk> there's a bug where it joins channels before authing for some reason

[11:23] <Ulti> also this is all remarkably well organised!

[11:23] <dpk> so it doesn't manage to get into #perl6 because of +r

[11:23] <Zoffix> dpk: make it send the auth pass as password to the server and  that'll avoid that

[11:23] <dpk> so i have to make it manually issue the command until i can get round to fixing the bug

[11:23] <Zoffix> dpk: ah cool. We now removed +r so should be fine from now on

[11:24] <dpk> hmm, does that work on non-freenode networks?

[11:24] <Zoffix> dpk: no idea, but I know it works on freenode

[11:24] <dpk> well i'm not willing to add any Freenode-specific code, so i'll have to investigate before that

[11:24] <Zoffix> :)

[11:24] <dpk> but thanks for the tip

[11:25] <Zoffix> dpk: sorry, would you make it join #perl6-dev #moarvm too? Seems same issue existed there (and now the channels are no longer +r too)

[12:31] <Ulti> just created a new label, since not really convinced fixing everything is necessarily the right call with more complex modules, but posting a detailed issue to fix ?

[12:32] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem-unbitrot: jkramer self-assigned YAML https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/6

[12:33] <jkramer> Should I close issues when the only problem is a failing dependency and I made a PR to fix the other module and closed the corresponding issue?

[12:33] <sena_kun> Ulti, if you cannot fix a complex module, yes, you can comment with a detailed error and that'd be an improvement. I think we can decide on what to do with such modules later, but the primary goal is to make work as many modules as we can, I think.

[12:34] <sena_kun> jkramer, try to install it with fixed dependency(it can be not always the only issue), if it works -> yes, label `failing dependency`, comment on `Foo is fixed now, closing`, and we're done.

[12:34] <El_Che> jkramer: I would leave ticker on the consuming module, so the author is aware the problem is there

[12:35] <jkramer> sena_kun: I did, it installs fine with the dependency installed

[12:35] <sena_kun> instructions say not to close such modules, but I think if it works now, then no issue present, really.

[12:35] <sena_kun> jkramer++

[12:36] <jkramer> Well it doesn't work YET (as in 'zef install' doesn't) because the PR to the dependency isn't merged yet

[12:37] <Ulti> sena_kun: yeah I think a good way to get things to work is just gentle prods too, when I've found some PR or issues in my modules I tend to actually fix what was broken plus do just a little bit more work whilst Im there too

[12:37] <Ulti> like last time someone prodded me about Stats I did some more work on functionality I've not yet pushed up

[12:40] <Ulti> hmmm an ecosystem bitrot service might not be a bad thing to build, so you can just register as an authority as being ok with spam about your modules being uninstallable

[12:41] <Ulti> like I was kind of shocked my module had stopped being installable and it was just a change to precision of how rats/nums got stringified and my test was badly written relying on stringification rather than numerically checking

[12:46] <Ulti> hmm does Travis and similar not have some kind of periodic checking functionality?

[12:46] <Ulti> feels like a genuinely missing piece

[12:46] <sena_kun> they check only commits afaik.

[12:52] <Ulti> sena_kun: ahh cool I guess the only thing missing is the bit that prods me :)

[12:52] <Ulti> I can probably make a little client my side to do that

[12:53] <MasterDuke> Ulti: i just found where it's set. travis-ci.org/<user>/<repo> and then "Settings" and then at the bottom is a "Cron Job" section

[12:53] <Ulti> awesome thanks

[12:53] <Ulti> that will keep me out of the bitrot charts at least

[12:53] <MasterDuke> np

[12:54] <Ulti> did feel a bit too obvious a feature

[12:54] <Ulti> weird mine is set to monthly as default

[12:56] <jkramer> How did the issues get populated? I assume there's some script building/testing all modules and reporting all fails?

[12:56] <MasterDuke> Xliff: i think hoelzro manages the docker stuff

[12:56] <MasterDuke> jkramer: https://toast.perl6.party/

[12:57] <jkramer> MasterDuke: Thanks

[12:57] <MasterDuke> toaster tested the modules, then AlexDaniel created a script to populate https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot

[12:58] <jkramer> I ask because one module seems to build, but it takes quite some time to do so. Looks like build was killed because it took too long.

[12:59] <hoelzro> adapting it to create a more bleeding edge rakudo wouldn't be super hard, though

[12:59] <El_Che> I am working in that direction, but haven't had much time

[13:30] <Zoffix> sena_kun: BTW zef has `look` command `zef look MPD::Client`

[13:30] <sena_kun> Zoffix, well, that's because you don't have mpd installed & run.

[13:30] <sena_kun> so it's predictable. But I wonder what's wrong with this version difference.

[13:30] <Zoffix> Yeah, but wouldn't an error about undeclared variable be thrown before anything attempts to connect to anything?

[13:31] <sena_kun> it would, yes.

[13:31] <Zoffix> Yeah, if I do `zef look MPD::Client` I too get a version with a bunch of hits vars

[13:31] <sena_kun> Zoffix, you tried `zef install MPD::Client`, not clonned repo?

[13:32] <sena_kun> pizza afk&

[13:32] <jkramer> Should anything be done about deprecated/obsolete/abandoned modules (i.e. somehow have it removed from modules.perl6.org) or just close the issue with an appropriate comment?

[13:33] <Zoffix> sena_kun: when I clone the repo and do `grep -FIRn hits` I get nothing, but if I `zef look MPD::Client` and do the same, I get a bunch of matches

[14:17] <sena_kun> jkramer, the issue is that such modules are not necessary to be deleted.

[14:17] <sena_kun> I mean, there may be some historical reasons.

[14:17] <sena_kun> Of course, I author wants, they can remove the module from ecosystem(I did it once, No Regrets(tm)), but it is not always the case.

[14:18] <MasterDuke> jkramer: there was a big discussion about that recently, i believe the end result was to leave them listed unless the author chooses to remove them

[15:10] <moritz> is there an easy way to find out if one of my modules has bitrotted?

[15:10] <timotimo> moritz: travis offers "cronjob" build schedules

[15:11] <moritz> that involves looking at every module, which doesn't quite meet my standard of "easy"

[15:12] <tyil> travis will email you when the cron fails as well I think

[15:12] <timotimo> yes

[15:12] <tyil> so you'll get notifications in your mailbox when it happens

[15:12] <timotimo> correct

[15:12] <moritz> but it means I have to set up travis for all modules in the first place

[15:23] <atroxaper> I know it is not a best time for questions, but... In Java world a class can have ‚ÄòThreadLocal‚Äô attribute. It means the attribute of an object of such class will has a value for an each thread. Can I have something similar in Perl 6? Maybe not as a class attribute, but in form of ‚Äòspecial‚Äô global storage. If I will use %!storage{$*THREAD.id} then I will face a garbage issue cause I cannot know when a thread has gone. Or can I?

[15:25] <timotimo> that's right

[15:27] <timotimo> well, i mean, there's NativeCall and pthread :)

[15:27] <timotimo> BBL

[15:28] <lizmat> Zoffix: repeatedly?  :-(

[15:28] <moritz> class ThreadWithStorage is Thread { has $.local-storage }

[15:28] <moritz> and then access $*THREAD.local-storage

[15:28] <moritz> maybe default it to an empty hash

[15:28] <timotimo> also, $*THREAD does role { has $.local-storage }

[15:29] <Zoffix> lizmat: no, happened the first time I ran it and it didn't happen more than that

[15:29] <lizmat> Zoffix: I thoight we could reliably read from a hash from multiple threads even if we make changes to the hash ?

[15:29] <timotimo> the problem is specifically reading while another thread adds

[15:29] <Zoffix> lizmat: I think maybe .race's guts got a.... race... in them

[15:29] <lizmat> timotimo: or deletes ?

[15:30] <atroxaper> moritz: Actually I write a lib. There is Log4j logging library in Java. It has NDC and MDC feature (https://wiki.apache.org/logging-log4j/NDCvsMDC) Log has context for current thread and put in the log message. It is useful for http server for example for track message for one sessions.

[15:30] <Zoffix> This is on 24-core box on 2018.06-289-g38de1e5 BTW

[15:31] <Zoffix> lizmat: oh, oh and I bumped degree on that race to 24

[15:32] <lizmat> 2x race  ?

[15:32] <Zoffix> lizmat: two words, but IIRC it's just one RaceSeq

[15:32] <atroxaper> moritz: it means I cannot manage threads myself :(

[15:33] <Zoffix> like, `race` prefix on `for` when looping over a raced Seq already just tells it to not switch into serial

[17:03] <xinming> Is it possible to speciffy function to either return Str or Hash?

[17:04] <timotimo> yes, but is it useful?

[17:04] <xinming> something like  sub abc returns (Str|Hash) { ... }

[17:04] <xinming> for some json, the old code uses return and decode manually,

[17:05] <xinming> Later, add option :decode, So, it'll either return Str or Hash

[17:05] <timotimo> sounds like you want a multi sub :)

[17:21] <lizmat> and possibly make that candidate occur *before* the other one

[19:28] <yoleaux> 2 Jun 2017 12:12Z <tbrowder> dwarring: you need to actually test the module with a Font::AFM object, then the IsFixedPitch test fails for Courier using ok (expected True)

[22:02] <sena_kun> for next unbitrotting? or do you want to redo issue repo?

[22:02] <sena_kun> *entirely

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: for this one. No need to redo it, my script will just tweak the instructions in existing tickets

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: and we'll have to reopen 25 issues, yes

[22:03] <sena_kun> oh, then fine.

[22:03] <sena_kun> also, is this feature with natives is good enough?

[22:03] <sena_kun> I mean, how does it handle e.g. different GNU/Linux distributions?

[22:04] <sena_kun> >Maybe one day we will figure out a way to resolve versions for native/bin dependencies, possibly via backends/plugins that access e.g. apt-get ( although this related more to the previously mentioned dependency hints ).

[22:05] <sena_kun> so it cannot do that yet. then I don't see how is it, hmm, well, it is clearly better, but still.

[22:42] <benjikun> They get by the bannerbot :/

[22:42] <daemon> ah

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> u: üçï

[22:43] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+1F355 SLICE OF PIZZA [So] (üçï)

[22:43] <AlexDaniel> daemon: ‚Üë

[22:43] <daemon> not in my font set

[22:43] <daemon> comes up as a block of kludge

[22:44] *** zv joined
[22:44] <AlexDaniel> daemon: SQUASHathon is advertized as a gathering where you get free digital pizza. That is it :)

[22:44] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zv

[22:44] *** zv is now known as Guest48133

[22:44] <daemon> free digital bar would be far greater appreciated ;) kinda curious I do not have that char though, I seem to have most of them

[22:44] <AlexDaniel> daemon: can you see it in your browser? http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-08-03#l1935

[22:45] <daemon> yeah no problem there

[22:45] <daemon> it will be the font im using

[22:45] <daemon> Droid Sans Mono for Powerline 12

[22:45] <daemon> same as oh-my-zsh recommends or zsh recommends I forget which

[22:45] <daemon> it usually works for most things

[22:45] *** Guest48133 left
[22:45] <AlexDaniel> but it should use a fallback if it can't find the emoji in your current font

[22:46] <daemon> hexchat falls back to ascii blocks if it cannot find a match

[22:46] <daemon> that is a small [ ] with 4 digits in it representing the char

[22:46] <daemon> which really does not work well for utf stuff

[22:47] <AlexDaniel> it should be 6 digits :)

[22:48] <daemon> legacy all the way https://i.itsosticky.com/1eg588q.png

[22:48] <daemon> really need to put a more modern application type irc client together in mono or something 

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> 0 0 0 0 haha :)

[22:48] <AlexDaniel> what editor do you use?

[22:49] <daemon> freebsd(ee) linux/freebsd(vim) linux(nano) windows(notepad++,vscode,visualstudio)

[22:49] <daemon> depends what system I am in and what I am doing really

[22:50] <AlexDaniel> I was hoping you'd say emacs so that I can recommend erc :)

[22:50] <daemon> one thing I never got to grips with

[22:50] <daemon> in truth I never really got to grips with vim, vi yes vim not so much

[22:50] <daemon> so I likely use it a touch less efficiently than is possible

[22:51] <benjikun> why?

[22:51] <daemon> because I grown up with ee and vi

[22:51] <daemon> they just seem more natural to me

[22:51] <benjikun> I see

[22:52] <daemon> that being said ... pico was a fork of ee and nano is a fork of pico

[22:52] <daemon> likewise vim is an extension of vi

[22:52] <daemon> so I guess all is as should be :P

[22:54] <benjikun> I just use vim now

[22:54] <benjikun> The only others I've really used (in terminal that is) are joe and nano

[22:54] <daemon> ah I tried joe a ... what seems like a lifetime ago

[22:55] <daemon> cannot even remember what it was like, so most likely did not get on with it lol

[22:55] <daemon> the worst experience in my life was using ed to fix a simple config file

[22:55] <benjikun> lol

[22:56] <daemon> for anyone wondering what that is (and never had the fun and adventure): https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ed(1)

[22:56] <daemon> no VT100 serial connection into a router

[22:56] <daemon> took me almost 4 hours to figure out where the bloody typo was
