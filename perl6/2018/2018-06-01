[01:12] <b2gills> Zoffix: Then you have a problem with Stack Overflow's CSS, not with me. If you note, the way it is now, you can change the `1.` to any number and it will correctly renumber it on presentation, because it is now a correctly formatted Markdown ordered list. Also I told you in case you didn't like the change. There is no reason to be a _____________ about it. (Note that I made it so it would be easier to change the urls in the future 

[01:12] *** mcmillhj left

[01:22] <Zoffix> b2gills: I had no problems until you started editing my shit. The seven prior edits to the answer should've suggested to you I didn't just type it all up with my eyes closed. It was perfect and you ruined it and there isn't even a reverse button for me to undo it.

[01:24] <Zoffix> But I no longer care. In 22 hours all those posts will be from "user342432". Edit them 'till you blue in the face.

[01:24] *** Zoffix left
[01:24] <b2gills> Zoffix: I assumed that you don't know all the syntax of Markdown, partially because you keep putting way too many dashes for a horizontal rule (you only need three), and that you keep using the worst way to add hyperlinks. You should always use named "variable" links at either the top or bottom of the page.

[01:30] *** wamba left
[01:36] <b2gills> There was no need for me to notify you of the change. I gave you the courtesy of telling you so that if you really didn't like it you could click on “rollback”. I even gave you the link where you would need to go to find it. If I didn't think of you as a rational adult, I wouldn't have changed it.

[02:19] <TEttinger> I'm not sure why people continue to think of Zoffix as a rational adult... he seems to have these weird angsty phases, where he just yells at people for confusing reasons, with regularity. I'm just an observer, I have no vested interest here, but the guy needs to grow up

[02:28] * perlawhirl sings "why can't we be friends"

[02:29] <perlawhirl> talking _about_ people rarely helps. human's are allowed to get angry sometimes... but we also have the capacity to see beyond these moments

[02:34] <b2gills> TEttinger: I think that what you wrote, wasn't written in the best spirit. Neither is what I wrote. The difference is I was having a disagreement with him and was emotional over it. (It was also far nicer than what I was originally going to write).

[02:35] <TEttinger> it's just that he does this regularly... it seems like he needs to acknowledge it

[02:39] <atweiden-air> i'm almost certain i read in the docs somewhere it's possible to lookup a variable's name, e.g. `my $variable; $variable.HOW.^self_name eq 'variable'`

[02:39] <atweiden-air> does anyone know how to do this?

[02:41] *** mcmillhj left
[02:41] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: but keep in mind that only works with proper variables. If a thing has something bound to it, that will give the name of the bound thing, or even crash with "no such method"

[05:02] <gegagome> hi guys, I am new to perl so pardon my ignorance, but if an employer is looking for a perl developer, do they mean perl6?

[05:02] <gegagome> and how do I know if a tutorial is perl5 or perl6?

[05:04] <raschipi> No, they mean perl 5.

[05:05] <raschipi> Everywhere you see just Perl, it's Perl 5.

[05:05] <raschipi> If it's about Perl 6, it will be explicity about that.

[05:05] <gegagome> I see

[05:07] <gegagome> got it

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: fwiw there's no problem for me, I'm fine with not editing your comments. The thing is that in many environments these kinds of microcontributions are encouraged (wikis, stackoverflow, even source code of projects)

[07:30] <AlexDaniel> and sometimes I even explicitly note that my comment can be edited, if it's a list of something

[07:31] <AlexDaniel> recently github introduced edit history for comments, so I guess there are not many reasons for not editing someone's stuff…

[07:34] <AlexDaniel> IMO it's fine being passionate about what you do, and getting a bit emotional is totally ok for me… as long as we focus on the actual topic and not downgrade to personal insults

[07:36] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I would like also good answers in StackOverflow to _not_ be removed. 

[07:36] <AlexDaniel> and whether someone is an adult or not really should not matter, I hope we won't be using age as a means for discrimination…

[07:37] <AlexDaniel> I mean, just the idea of saying that someone is an adult or not is just wrong in its root, regardless of an actual age

[07:38] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: what do you mean?

[07:38] <AlexDaniel> I think if you delete your account then it turns your answers into community wiki, no?

[07:59] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: that I will :-)

[08:00] <AlexDaniel> that I now resolved

[10:25] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: some test files are known to either not work locally, or not work at all…

[10:25] <AlexDaniel> feel free to unbust anything

[10:25] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: as for the stuff being left behind, if that happens you probbably need to do ｢rm -rf /tmp/whateverable/rakudo-moar/*｣

[10:26] <El_Che> wow

[10:27] <El_Che> until it's cleaned up a containers would be handy :)

[10:27] <AlexDaniel> we can probably eliminate the issue if we also save the PID of the process…

[10:27] <AlexDaniel> and it doesn't affect bots running on the server because they have each their own virtual /tmp

[12:15] <jkramer> Yeah, but realistically I probably wouldn't ever write ²²² in real-life and expect it to do something useful, so for me it's no biggie :)

[12:16] <jkramer> I only found that by accident trying to find out how ² is implemented so it turns into **2 and works in code like (1,2,3)>>²

[12:17] <El_Che> I would expect it to panic there

[12:17] <jkramer> In (1,2,3)>>² ?

[12:19] <jkramer> Actually I still don't know how ² is implemented, that's why I tried ².^name in the first place. :) I expected it to be defined as something like -> $n { $n ** 2 } so it works in >>²

[13:51] <SmokeMachine> does the vim plugin works on CommaIDE?

[13:51] <El_Che> isn't commaide just a plugin?

[13:51] <El_Che> I would expect it could be combined with other plugins 

[13:52] *** andrzejku_ left
[13:52] <jnthn> El_Che: It's both standalone IDE *and* can be used as a plugin

[13:53] <El_Che> yes, that's what I mean

[13:53] <El_Che> also being a plugin it should work with other plugins

[13:54] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Just installed the Vim plugin in Comma. Wow. I shoulda done this earlier. :D

[13:54] <El_Che> pretty much how most language specific plugins/standalone intellij ide works

[13:54] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: I can't use IntelliJ without that! :)

[13:55] <jnthn> El_Che: Right, it's plugins all the way down (or up), pretty much. :)

[13:55] <El_Che> (as in: if you need more than 1 lang, you'll endup with regular intellij + plugins)

[14:08] <jnthn> I didn't see *that* happen before, now. Please use the built-in report thing to send us the full trace. As to how well it works...it certainly needs a pretty recent MoarVM to stand much chance.

[14:09] <atroxaper> Just updated perl6 from master... And send report ofcource.

[14:12] <jnthn> Thanks, we'll take a look

[14:13] <El_Che> jnthn: if rakudo java was on par with the regular one it would make your life easier in Java land, I guess

[14:16] <jnthn> Hmm...maybe, though I'm doubtful we could have re-used the Rakudo parsing impl. What the IDEA platform wants there is just a bit too different to adapt. And you need a grammar that accepts every input too.

[14:18] <El_Che> I see

[14:18] <jnthn> What we actually built is a compiler that turns a Perl 6 grammar subset into a lexer/parser

[14:18] <El_Che> impressive

[14:19] <jnthn> And then took the Perl 6 grammar and marked it up with what tokens/tree nodes should be produced

[14:19] <El_Che> it pays off to have the rakudo guy on the team :)

[14:19] <jnthn> So we follow the real grammar pretty faithfully

[14:19] <jnthn> So if you write stuff like a regex with a code block in it with a string in it that interpolates another code block that does a regex, then we'll cope alright. :)

[14:20] <jnthn> Whether the reader of such code will also cope alright is another matter :P

[14:29] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I see the pop corn part now

[14:31] <Zoffix> El_Che: yeah "Edits are expected to be substantial and to leave the post better than you found it" and which hasn't happened after b2gills's edit. "The rollback action itself then appears as the most recent item in the edit history." I only had rollback buttons for my own edits, not b2gills's, presumably because they have more rep. And since the diff included the entire post, I couldn't even manually edit it

[14:31] <Zoffix> without reviewing the entire post

[14:32] <Zoffix> El_Che: "this may not be the site for you." Yeah, agreed, which is why I deleted my account. Writing expert content to line the pockets of some nerd who does nothing while a stranger messes up your work is certainly not for me.

[14:36] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: I like to believe I started GitHub's move to implement edit history when I emailed them saying a hostile user was editing my Issues and was damaging my character by misrepresenting what content my Issues contained. Thus, I don't believe they added it just so a stranger could barge in and make three of my sentences bold just because they felt like it. The comment is listed as posted by me. Just

[14:36] <Zoffix> because there's a way to perform two clicks to view the parts that weren't added by me doesn't mean most readers will automatically see which parts aren't from me. 

[14:37] <El_Che> Yeah, it seems to be an "deal with it or leave" policy

[14:37] <Zoffix> This is the equivalent of personal space IRL. Just because you can stand 2 inches away from my face doesn't mean you should do that.

[14:39] <El_Che> Zoffix: someone was trolling you changing your issues in bad faith?

[14:39] <El_Che> that sounds bad

[14:41] <geekosaur> I have other issues with SO, unrelated to this, but it still comes down to "everything must be on SO!" translating to "you don't want me to contribute"

[14:42] <El_Che> geekosaur: I don't see it like that

[14:42] <geekosaur> I noticed

[14:42] <El_Che> geekosaur: it's just a popular medium that it's a first stop for many programmers

[14:42] <geekosaur> you do not control my opinion, so I don't care how you see it

[14:42] <geekosaur> and it's not you that's doing most of the pushing anyway

[14:42] <El_Che> geekosaur: and ofter the first link after a google search

[14:42] <Zoffix> El_Che: they weren't trolling. I left a negative review of their project on CPANRatings and then filed a few bugs. They edited the issues to remove the actual bug reports and then added their own comment saying "issue deleted because the user is agressive" or something along those lines

[14:43] <El_Che> in my opinion, the "everything" part applies to the doc site

[14:43] <El_Che> SO is marketing

[15:05] <timotimo> atroxaper: can you help me help you with the debugging issue?

[15:05] <atroxaper> timotimo: with pleasant!))

[15:05] <timotimo> i'm not 100% sure how to go about this; let's start with what version of perl6 is in your SDK?

[15:06] <Zoffix> "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."

[15:06] <atroxaper> timotimo: on CommaIDE or Plugin&

[15:06] <timotimo> Zoffix: put it at risk .. of being AWESOME! :P

[15:07] <timotimo> atroxaper: which ever you are using i guess?

[15:07] <timotimo> locally i have only the plugin in a regular IntelliJ IDEA

[15:07] <atroxaper> timotimo: I download full CommaIDE for sure. And could setup SDK perl6 only from rakudobrew.

[15:08] <atroxaper> perl6 2018.05.43 now

[15:08] <timotimo> OK, that is new enough to have the debugserver in it, at the very least

[15:08] *** skids joined
[15:09] *** domidumont left
[15:11] <timotimo> OK, here's something you can try: in the run configuration that you use to debug, open the environment variables window, add a new one called MDS_PROTOCOL, set its value to "yes"

[15:14] <timotimo> and run the debug process

[15:14] <timotimo> it should give a lot of output in the console, hopefully

[15:15] <timotimo> another thing we could try is setting the Debug Port to something that's surely unused in the Debug part of the Run Configuration

[15:15] <atroxaper> timotimo: added just "thread 1 reacting to suspend request"

[15:16] <timotimo> hm, if the address were already in use, moar would panic at the start, so that can't be it

[15:17] <atroxaper> Yes. If I run the second debug then I see MoarVM panic...

[15:17] <timotimo> right. comma needs to learn to find a free port before starting

[15:17] <timotimo> and after the output appears you get that timeout error again?

[15:18] *** mahafyi left
[15:19] <atroxaper> yes. Actually the process is not finished. Just stuck.

[15:19] <timotimo> is there any kind of firewall in place that might prevent the IDE from connecting to localhost on that port?

[15:21] <timotimo> hm, it's probably not an ipv4/ipv6 problem?

[15:21] <atroxaper> I think no/

[15:22] <jnthn> timotimo: Is the suspend request something that can only be sent from the outside, or is that just because of it starting the program suspended?

[15:23] <timotimo> the timeout for that connection is 2 seconds; it doesn't take that long to launch the moar process, right?

[15:23] <timotimo> by itself, moar reaches the point where the port is opened in under a milisecond

[15:23] <atroxaper> Gonna try to completely reinstall IntellijIDEA 

[15:23] <jnthn> timotimo: No, given it doesn't even load anything at the point it's suspended

[15:24] *** wamba left
[15:24] <timotimo> indeed

[15:29] <atroxaper> jnthn: I clone rakudo, did configure and make. If I select rakudo folder in SDK dialog then I get "currupt" message :(

[15:30] <atroxaper> jnthn: I can choice SDK only from rakudobrew folder.

[15:30] <timotimo> what folder exactly are you using?

[15:30] <timotimo> i think it has to be the one you put into --prefix= with Configure.pl

[15:30] <atroxaper> ~/git/rakudo/

[15:30] *** comborico1611 joined
[15:30] <timotimo> actually, the bin folder from the install prefix

[15:30] <jnthn> atroxaper: It needs to be a directory containing a perl6 binary (or perl6.bat on Windows)

[15:31] <timotimo> we could surely point that out in the error message

[15:31] <jnthn> Yeah, or just try looking under bin/

[15:31] <timotimo> right, or install/bin :)

[15:31] <jnthn> Though in most cases folks have a Perl 6 in their PATH and we just find that and don't make them select anything :)

[15:31] <atroxaper> The root of rakudo repository has perl6 binary...

[15:32] <Zoffix> jkramer: the superscript operators are implemented in the grammar that rewrites them to a call of &postfix:<ⁿ> : https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp#L4340 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L7679-L7691 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/c80ea2f28/src/core/Numeric.pm6#L280

[15:32] <timotimo> that's not one that works outside of the repository

[15:32] <jnthn> Yes, but that binary doesn't work outside of the Rakudo directory, I believe.

[15:32] <atroxaper> I have perl6 in the PATH and have to setup SDK.

[15:32] <timotimo> comma is supposed to find the perl6 in path and suggest it as an SDK i think?

[15:33] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes

[15:33] <atroxaper> Ok. Then I just choice the one from rakudobrew ^^

[15:33] <timotimo> we can surely figure out the case when someone selects the perl6 from inside the source folder

[15:33] <jnthn> timotimo: Probably yes, but we can't really make it work. :-)

[15:33] <Zoffix> jkramer: and handling of ² as a term is implemented as simply unicode properties: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp#L3607 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L7906-L7918

[15:34] <timotimo> indeed. we can just make sure the user understands why it's wrong

[15:34] *** araraloren joined
[15:34] <jnthn> I would like us to some day have a way that you can point Comma at Rakudo sources and then you will be able to Go To Declaration into there and debug into it and so forth :)

[15:35] <timotimo> agreed

[15:35] *** zakharyas left
[15:37] <Zoffix> The bug reporting in comma don't work for me

[15:38] <Zoffix> The bug being if you use `unit class Foo` it indents all the stuff as if I wrote `class Foo {`

[15:38] <jnthn> Zoffix: How did you try to do it?

[15:38] <jnthn> ah, then probably we're not thinking of the same thing, 'cus that wouldn't cause an exception, and the reporter I'm thinking of is for those cases

[15:39] <Zoffix> jnthn: I went to "Help-> Submit feedback" and it crashed and said "Submit a bug report". So I typed stuff up, and clicked send and it greyed out all the buttons and just sat there doing apparently nothing. I waited a couple minutes and closed it and clicking "Help Submit feedback" did nothing afterwards

[15:39] *** ZeonPeon joined
[15:39] <Zoffix> Ok, now looks like it worked (the sending after crash)

[15:40] <jnthn> Hm, weird. Was gonna say, I already had some reports in the DB from before

[15:40] <jnthn> ah

[15:41] <atroxaper> timotimo: as I understand, moar opens 9999 port and wait "somebody" to connect to it. Right?

[15:41] <jnthn> Zoffix: Aha, found what happened in the logs.

[15:41] <timotimo> that's right. somebody == comma's debugger feature

[15:42] <jnthn> btw, the site that'd used to sell and offer Comma downloads is built using Cro :)

[15:42] <ZeonPeon> Is there a way of specifying the type of list items for a sub argument?

[15:42] <Zoffix> Cool

[15:42] *** parv left
[15:42] <Zoffix> ZeonPeon: yeah, use the where clause

[15:43] <Zoffix> m: -> @ where .all ~~ Int { say "all are Ints" }(<1 2 3>)

[15:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «all are Ints␤»

[15:43] <ZeonPeon> Like "List where Str :$item"?

[15:43] <Zoffix> m: -> @ where .all ~~ Int { say "all are Ints" }(<1 2e0 3>)

[15:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '<anon>'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got List ($(IntStr.new(1, "1"),...)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[15:43] <ZeonPeon> Oh, so a subset type thingy

[15:43] <Zoffix> Basically, yeah

[15:43] <ZeonPeon> Thank you

[15:44] <Zoffix> eco: WhereList

[15:44] <buggable> Zoffix, WhereList 'Simpler `where` constraints for items of lists': http://modules.perl6.org/dist/WhereList:github:Zoffix%20Znet

[15:44] <Zoffix> There's also that module if you have a bunch of complex constraints on lists

[15:45] <ZeonPeon> Neat, mind if I ask another question?

[15:45] <Zoffix> No, ask away.

[15:45] <ZeonPeon> Is there anyway of importing using a namespace?

[15:45] <ZeonPeon> Like pythons "import <whatever> as what"?

[15:46] <Zoffix> There's some binding-to-constant syntax

[15:47] * Zoffix tries locally

[15:47] <ZeonPeon> Thanks

[15:47] <Zoffix> constant IRC = (require IRC::Client); say IRC.new

[15:48] <ZeonPeon> Ohh

[15:48] <Zoffix> So the class is named IRC::Client, but that lets you instantiate it via `IRC` name

[15:48] <ZeonPeon> That's handy

[15:49] <ZeonPeon> I'm guessing you can use that to dynamically load modules?

[15:51] <Zoffix> yeah

[15:51] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'print "Enter module name to load: "; my $name := get; my \Mod = (require ::($name)); say Mod.new'                                                                                                                     

[15:51] <Zoffix> Enter module name to load: IRC::Client

[15:51] <Zoffix> IRC::Client.new(filters =>

[15:52] <Zoffix> Tried sticking `get` directly inside ::() and it didn't wanna load it. Prolly a bug

[15:52] <ZeonPeon> odd

[15:52] *** troys joined
[15:52] <ZeonPeon> Can you import by path?

[15:54] <ZeonPeon> Say I want to have a specific module for scraping a site, would I have to have them all in the same lib directory or can I have them in their own specific directories throughout the filesystem?

[15:56] <Zoffix> dunno

[15:57] <ZeonPeon> So I'm reading the modules wiki page and I'm guessing you could store the Module name & file as "Module::File" and dynamically import based on that

[15:58] <ZeonPeon> Thank you again for the help

[15:58] <timotimo> i'll be AFK for a little bit. atroxaper if you want to try if debugging works in general, that'd be cool. you can try installing zef install --/test App::MoarVM::Debug and then "moar-remote 9999" with 9999 being the debug port used

[15:59] <atroxaper> timotimo: will try

[15:59] <timotimo> thank you. see you soon!

[16:00] <Zoffix> bdfoy would love comma... It seems to indent with his style

[16:03] <atroxaper> timotimo: "Connecting to MoarVM remote on localhost port 9999 success!"

[16:03] <Zoffix> Or maybe it's a bug... don't see any indent settings

[16:04] <Zoffix> No #commaide?

[16:06] <jnthn> Zoffix: No, though could make a ##commaide for now I guess

[16:08] * jnthn joined it

[16:08] <Zoffix> I already kinda found the answer to my question, since indents behave fine if they're in scope. Gonna email a bug report to [email@hidden.address] (since "Submit feedback" crashes)

[16:09] <jnthn> Zoffix: Yeah, though I already fixed the backend issue that you ran into when typing a bug into the crash report there 

[16:09] <jnthn> It's certainly not *meant* to indent bdf style ;)

[16:10] <Zoffix> jnthn: there are two bugs tho: clicking "Submit feedback" causes a crash and sending that crash was freezing.

[16:11] <Zoffix> jnthn: or is that how submit feedback works? It just generates an exception you can submit?

[16:11] <jnthn> Zoffix: Yes, sending the crash freezing was the thing I fixed. It was a failure in the thing that received the report.

[16:11] *** ChoHag left
[16:12] <jnthn> Zoffix: Yes, just creating an exception you could submit with details is the "hack" solution.

[16:12] <Zoffix> Cool

[16:12] <jnthn> I would say "not the long term one", but I doubt it'll survive to the next release even :)

[18:36] <colomon> Comma things I’ve noticed so far:

[18:36] *** ZeonPeon left
[18:37] <colomon> 1) Seems like it’s selecting file type based on extension?  With .pm a p5 file and no extension just plain text, maybe?

[18:37] <colomon> 2) On Mac, the tool tip’s “control-B” command is actually “command-B”

[18:38] <colomon> 3) I’ve not been able to figure out how to run my script (now that I have one recognized as p6) from within the IDE.  Hitting run doesn’t do anything as far as I can tell.

[18:39] <Ulti> jnthn: congrats on the release \o/

[18:39] <timotimo> colomon: aye, you'll need to create a "run configuration"

[18:39] <timotimo> on the left of the run/debug/stop buttons there's a drop-down that'll let you do that

[18:39] <colomon> “add configuration” ?

[18:40] <timotimo> yup

[18:40] <jnthn> colomon: https://commaide.com/docs/running :)

[18:41] <colomon> Ah.  I thought I’d done that, but apparently I actually modified the default templates instead of creating one that could be used

[18:41] <jnthn> And yes, it goes by extension to decide what is Perl 6

[18:41] <colomon> that’s got that working

[18:41] <jnthn> (.p6, .pl6, .pm6)

[18:41] <jnthn> You can associate a particular file with a file type also

[18:41] <timotimo> ah, yes, that's a feature that also surprised me multiple times, colomon 

[18:42] <timotimo> BBL

[18:42] <Ulti> "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." why are you trying to hack me!!!! zomg

[18:43] <colomon> jnthn: I think I see my fundamental problem here: from the “Comma Downloads” page, it has “For installation instructions, see the documentation”, and when you click on documentation, it takes you to the installation instructions.  

[18:44] <colomon> That (plus the tool tips) successfully distracted me from seeing that there is full documentation under the documentation tab on the website.

[18:44] <Ulti> wow that splash screen :D 

[18:44] <jnthn> Ah, and then it's not clear that there's actually more documentation :)

[18:45] <jnthn> Yeah, should probably do something at the top of the page to indicate you're within the documentation :)

[22:16] <timotimo> OK, we'll start work on SixHub right away

[22:16] <El_Che> powered by Cro

[22:16] <El_Che> the upside is that it will support pod6 just fine

[22:16] <El_Che> :)

[22:18] <lizmat> I think it need to be shorter: start with Perl6Hub, then P6Hub, then just Pub  :-)
