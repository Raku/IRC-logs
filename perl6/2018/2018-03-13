[07:39] <lookatme> there are some module you can try . I think

[07:39] <lookatme> grep: getopt

[07:39] <greppable6> lookatme, 155 lines, 16 modules: https://gist.github.com/e03db5edc08a6c188f4f2e0d11167e4a

[07:42] *** noganex joined
[07:42] <teatime> I know about getopt et al., was just wondering if Perl6's MAIN stuff was reusable

[07:42] <teatime> I will def. check out your module, though.

[07:42] <teatime> lookatme++

[07:43] <teatime> hehe, yay, I got to give it its first github star

[07:43] <lookatme> thanks

[07:43] <lookatme> MAIN is enough for most case

[07:44] <teatime> it does work surprisingly well

[07:44] <teatime> when I first learned Perl6 was going to build-in argument parsing

[07:45] <teatime> I thought it was a bad idea, because I figured it would be difficult to get right, and if it was a built-in shouldn't have obvious flaws/deficiencies

[07:45] <lookatme> yeah, that's a useful feature :)

[07:45] <teatime> but then I looked at it, and couldn't really find anything to complain about, heh

[07:46] <lookatme> though I want some more flexible style like `-foo 2` rather than `-foo=2`

[07:46] <lookatme> so I create my module :)

[08:39] <ufobat> why not inline::perl5 net::ldap?

[08:39] <FROGGS> yeah, I could give that a try

[11:38] <jnthn> Probably to understand what's happening :)

[11:38] <mr_ron> looking at https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126198

[11:39] <masak> oh; in that case, carry on ;)

[11:39] <araraloren> so it should print (Proxy) ?

[11:39] <masak> if you add .VAR it should, yes

[11:39] <masak> if you don't have .VAR, it should loop infinitely

[11:40] <masak> because you're (implicitly) calling a thing from within itself

[11:40] <araraloren> oh

[11:41] <araraloren> clear !

[14:30] <cfa> morning

[14:30] <cfa> [Coke]: thanks (and oops)

[14:30] <masak> good afternoon, cfa 

[14:30] <cfa> hi masak 

[14:31] <[Coke]> cfa: no worries.

[14:32] <[Coke]> cfa: https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests shows a way to run the extended tests on just your local changes, btw.

[14:32] * cfa nods

[14:33] <[Coke]> but I run it every few days or so, not a huge deal

[14:33] <cfa> in the MAIN case i copy-pasted the example and didn't think to test whether `unit` would cause problems

[14:33] * [Coke] notes he's working on the duplicates test, which is currently borked. nearly there.

[14:36] <cfa> neat

[16:03] <cfa> yeah, but this is re: http://design.perl6.org/S03.html#line_2537

[16:03] <cfa> where list contextualizer is used to refer to the list routine

[16:03] <cfa> whereas its behaviour differs from @() and .list

[16:11] <cfa> updated my previously confus{ed,ing} comment on https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1711

[16:14] <Zoffix> cfa: note the message at the top of that page. Those documents are historical and in many places differ from today's language. The `@` contextulizer in Rakudo calls .cache method (doesn't look like the spec mandates it; only the return value), which on all but Seq type calls .list method, which returns a Positional type (so, say, Int is not Positional so it'd be listified and returned as (Int,), while List and

[16:14] <Zoffix> Array are position so those would be returned as List and Array). When it comes to &list the sub, there's inconsistency with how it handles Seq (it just returns a Seq, despite it not being Positional). It's R#1344 which is blocked by R#1355

[23:47] <thowe> Can someone tell me how I would get the last day of a month using DateTime?  Or is there a way?

[23:50] <cfa> m: say DateTime.new(year => 2018, month => 2).days-in-month

[23:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5031dab3a: OUTPUT: «28␤»

[23:50] <cfa> thowe: ^^^

[23:51] *** mr_ron left
[23:52] <cfa> m: say DateTime.new(year => 2020, month => 2).days-in-month  # leap year

[23:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5031dab3a: OUTPUT: «29␤»

[23:52] <thowe> oh, yeah...  duh

[23:52] <thowe> I'm looking for some kind of last method or somsuch.  I'm clearly not in the right state of mind for this.  I should just go home.

[23:53] <thowe> cfa, Thank you, kind person of the net

[23:53] <timotimo> thowe: do you know .truncated-to? you can easily .earlier :1day i think

[23:54] <timotimo> i mean like take the month you're interested in, truncate to month, go forwards one month, go backwards 1 day

[23:54] <thowe> I'm just looking at it now as I want to re-write my invoice calculator in Perl6.

[23:54] <thowe> They keep throwing hardware at the old one, and I need some way to make replacing it fun.  So... Perl6.

[23:56] <thowe> the symbols like :1day suprise me.  what are these things called? 

[23:57] <thowe> if I know their name maybe I can find them in the docs.
