[00:00] <holyghost> So that should be my first working CPAN package

[00:04] <holyghost> this last working version is also on github.com/theholyghost2

[00:04] <timotimo> the source code won't be visible on modules.perl6.org for at least an hour or so

[00:05] *** kurahaupo left
[00:05] <timotimo> the first argument is the value that's supposed to be checked and the second argument is what comment to output as the description

[00:06] <timotimo> so you're just checking all these values whether they boolify to true or false

[00:08] <holyghost> It's all numbers which get compared with 'ok'

[00:08] <holyghost> the system itself is foolproof

[00:09] <timotimo> no

[00:09] <timotimo> ok does not compare numbers

[07:59] <Xliff_> Is this for December?

[07:59] <jmerelo> Xliff_: right.

[08:00] <Xliff_> jmerelo: Let me think about it. I would like to write something, but am rather swamped, at the moment.

[08:00] <jmerelo> Xliff_: you can claim Dec 24th :-)

[08:00] <Xliff_> You never know, though. The bug might strike me and I can come up with something in a day.

[08:00] <Xliff_> Well. I'd rather remain a hold-out until I KNOW I will be writing something.

[08:01] <Xliff_> Would rather not disappoint by having nothing.

[08:01] <jmerelo> Xliff_: OK. Thanks for considering it anyway

[08:01] <jmerelo> Xliff_: it's not like the slots are flying... Sadly.

[08:01] <Xliff_> I will keep in mind, though. Might give me something to do next week.

[08:01] <Xliff_> OK! I will see what I can come up with.

[08:01] <jmerelo> Xliff_: you don't need to write it now, only by the day you claim in December. A few days before that, if possible.

[08:03] <Xliff_> Yes. I know. :)

[16:23] <jnthn> lizmat: Really? self.new calls directly to BUILDALL if self.bless is just the Mu one?

[16:24] <jnthn> And that "is it the Mu one" check turns into a constant at specialization time

[16:24] <lizmat> aaah... yes, we optimized that... still, it's an extra check to see if the bless is the same ?

[16:24] <lizmat> ah,..  ok

[16:24] <lizmat> lucasb: sorry for the noise...

[16:24] <lucasb> np. so, no need to change?

[16:24] <jnthn> The specialization is keyed on the type of `self`, so it's not even an extra guard :)

[16:25] <lizmat> lucasb: as jnthn said: no, no need to change

[16:25] <jnthn> There's further opts we can do to object construction (we're not beating Ruby/Python at that benchmark yet, dammit)

[16:26] <jnthn> But this particular aspect of things is handled pretty well.

[16:26] <lizmat> yeah, it is  :)

[16:26] <lizmat> jnthn: we don't have a way to do >>op<< where "op" is a variable, right ?

[16:27] <jnthn> Bracketed infix function form allows it maybe?

[16:27] <jnthn> >>[&foo]<<

[18:23] <uzl> From the article: "If you do not specify a default value, then the type constraint will be assumed."

[18:23] <uzl> In this case, what will be the assumed type constraint? Any? Nil?

[18:25] *** zakharyas joined
[18:26] <uzl> From what I gather in Perl 6, variable assignment, instead of binding to a value, binds to a container which makes the variable mutable. What's the approach in Perl 5?

[18:33] <lucasb> I think it's the same thing. $a = $b, @a = @b, %a = %b all copies the contents of one container to other 

[18:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaiepi

[18:34] <lucasb> different from most other dynamic languages, I think, where "a = b" just copies the object reference

[18:35] *** lizmat left
[18:35] <uzl> lucasb: Are you aware of any other languages that use the concept of containers?

[18:36] <uzl> "all copies the contents of one container to other" <- btw, are you referring to P5 or P6? I never heard of container in P5, just references.

[18:37] *** hythm_ joined
[18:37] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v hythm_

[18:38] <lucasb> I think "$a = $b", "@a = @b", and "%a = %b" works exactly the same in P5 and P6

[18:39] <lucasb> indeed, "containers" in P5 doesn't get talked much, but semantically, it's there

[18:43] *** |Sno| joined
[18:44] <uzl> Oh, I see. In the most known P5 books, authors usually something "Perl Graphical Structures" to help the readers visualize how references work. Are there such diagrams to highlight the difference between binding and assigning to a variable in P6?

[18:48] <hythm_> Hi #perl6, I'm having trouble writing a recursive routine that takes a  list of lists and check the items recursively (take or leave some items based on a condition). I thought of writing a multi, when the argument  is a list, call same sub. if the argument is an item, return the item if it meets the condition. I wrote a test in the following link and explained in a more details what I'm trying to achieve

[18:59] <lucasb> hythm_: ((1)) doesn't create a nested list

[19:02] <lucasb> maybe it doesn't matter in the example, but things like "($x)" makes the example harder to read :)

[19:03] *** domidumont1 left
[19:03] <lucasb> uzl: sorry, no graphical representation of data structures that I'm aware of. But there are the types hierachy in Graphviz images in docs, you know

[19:03] <hythm_> lucas, yeah you are right, I was trying to make it simple but I think I made it more complicated.

[19:05] <uzl> lucasb: That's fine. Thanks!

[19:06] <hythm_> I used Data::Dump::Tree it makes the data structure more clearer.

[19:06] <uzl> m: my @a = [(1, ((2), (3)))]; say @a.deepmap(-> $_ { not .Int %% 2 });

[19:06] <evalable6> uzl, rakudo-moar 005261a4c: OUTPUT: ¬´[True (False True)]‚ê§¬ª

[19:07] <evalable6> uzl, Full output: https://gist.github.com/1a0434e4cd9f81066bbed9da937bb071

[19:12] <hythm_> deepmap works here but it will not work in other scenarios, it works here because (1, ((2), (3)))  is a list of two items    1    and ((2), (3))     ,, from the first item it takes 1,, from the second items it takes either 2 or 3

[19:13] <lucasb> hm, Data::Dump::Tree doesn't seem to be update recently. it's failing the tests

[19:15] <hythm_> yeah, I think some modules broke due to recent updates, thank you anyway

[19:16] <uzl> yeah. And the other thing, I think, is that you might not able to return the values that meet condition, just the boolean of the evaluation.

[19:17] <hythm_> true, thats why I'm trying to write a multi with gather & take

[19:20] <hythm_> the difficult part is in a datastructure like that  (($a1, (($b2), ($b3))), ($a1, (($b1), ($b2))))  which is basically a list of two llists,, the first is  ($a1, (($b2), ($b3)))    and the second is ($a1, (($b1), ($b2))).  and I should take all the items from either the first  or  all the items the second list

[19:21] <hythm_> deepmap will go through all the items, so it wont work here

[19:25] <hythm_> the extra parens are to separate the items in groups,, for example  ($a1, (($b2), ($b3))     indicates that I need to take $a1,,,, and  (($b2), ($b3))   it parens indiocates I need to take either $b2 or $b3
