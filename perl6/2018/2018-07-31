[00:53] <hi> how to compile libperl.a from perl source.

[00:53] *** hi is now known as Guest17966

[00:53] <Guest17966> tried with -fFPIC. no luck.

[00:53] <Juerd> Guest17966: Are you sure that's a Perl 6 question? :)

[00:54] *** kalkin-- left
[00:54] <Juerd> Guest17966: libperl looks like something from Perl 5. The channel for Perl 5 is #perl

[00:55] <Guest17966> oh great thanks. let me try with #perl.

[00:55] <Guest17966> thanks Juerd

[03:58] <rouking> I'm looking at a lazy prime sieve in Haskell and it's really nice. `sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve (filter (\x -> mod x p /= 0) xs)`

[03:58] <rouking> I tried doing something similar in Perl 6, but it seems to try to eagerly evaluate

[04:01] <rouking> Anyone know to express the logic in a similar way and get lazy evaluation? I mean, I can do it the non-functional way, but it's not really the same :(

[04:07] <benjikun> rouking: There's this https://github.com/CurtTilmes/perl6-primesieve

[04:07] <benjikun> I'm assuming since it's a module, it'll be implemented pretty well

[04:07] <benjikun> otherwise you could implement your own fairly performant prime generator with .is-prime maybe

[04:08] <benjikun> that has an iterator that goes along with it, if you scroll down on the readme

[04:33] <benjikun> Good point, `but` doesn't catch same name collisions I guess

[04:33] *** mcmillhj left
[04:35] <benjikun> if you do it with two classes, you can do it like this

[04:36] <benjikun> m: my $ex = class one { has $.a = 1 }.new but class two { has $.a = 2 }.new; say $ex.two.a

[04:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7043559bb: OUTPUT: ¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[04:39] <benjikun> Perhaps we should put a warning in for that with mixin roles ...

[04:41] *** mcmillhj joined
[04:44] <benjikun> SmokeMachine: The docpage for `but` does include this: "If methods of the same name are present already, the last mixed in role takes precedence".

[04:45] <benjikun> A compilation warning could be nice though

[11:24] <tbrowder_> jmerelo: fingers crossed!

[11:26] <tbrowder_> jmerelo: did you see my comment yesterday about using a lock to help prevent conflicts between building doc and publishing doc website?

[11:26] <tbrowder_> could that be made to work?especially with allowing web edits?

[11:27] *** vini joined
[11:29] *** vini left
[11:31] *** vini joined
[11:31] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: yep, I saw that. It might work, but it's something I have to test

[11:32] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: problem is locks can creep up pretty fast and still there could be overlap between regenerations

[11:33] <tbrowder_> erg!

[11:33] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: and that would only sweep under the rug the underlying issue: 12 minutes to regenerate the whole site, no matter what.

[11:34] <jmerelo> So, I don't know. That would solve the small problem of de-sync between the search.js script and the actual pages, which is no small problem.

[11:34] *** vini left
[11:35] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: I think a more long-term solution in general would be to overhaul the site so that it uses extensively .precom caches

[11:35] *** xinming joined
[11:36] <tbrowder_> sounds like a plan!

[11:36] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: but that would go through creating a pod::cache module, which could be used extensively. That would kill several birds with a stone: it would speed up tests, would speed up regeneration of the site, and would allow us to understand better precomp caches...

[11:36] <jmerelo> (which are not well documented, BTW. I ghink that there are only a couple of persons, ugexe and hoelzro, who understand them well)

[11:37] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: so I was wondering, if you've got the time and will, maybe we could do a hangout over this and work over the next month? 

[11:38] <tbrowder_> i can only do it remotely, sorry to say

[11:40] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: (see also the priv msg)

[11:40] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: but remotely is OK as long as we can both hammer out on the subject. You are the expert on POD, so that's needed...

[12:45] <jmerelo> timotimo: I see. I think it's simply computed in a different way https://github.com/JJ/TPF-Grant/blob/master/data/commits.csv

[12:45] <jmerelo> timotimo: (sorry, didn't want to paste that)

[12:45] <timotimo> :)

[12:48] <jmerelo> timotimo: I think I'm using also build_depends and test_depends, and considering all modules, not the top 50. I see for instance JSON::Marshall is not in his list, I don't know why.

[12:49] <jmerelo> timotimo: but it's a cool project. To tell you the truth, when we started to do that we recalled vaguely something like that, but we couldn't manage to find it.

[12:49] <timotimo> OK

[12:49] <timotimo> yeah, i found it difficult to find again even though i knew a bunch about it

[12:50] <timotimo> now i have a bookmark

[12:50] <jmerelo> timotimo: which is good, I guess. So people can start new project from scratch :-)

[12:50] <jmerelo> timotimo: anyway, thanks for pointing it out to me.

[13:32] <RubioTerra> Hi, I'm having problems getting Comma to debug scripts

[13:32] <masak> RubioTerra: what's the problem?

[13:32] <RubioTerra> It doesn't seem to be able to connect to the moar instance

[13:32] <sena_kun> RubioTerra, you can pm me with details.

[13:32] <RubioTerra> "org.edument.moarvm.exception.CouldNotConnectException: Could not connect to debug server"

[13:34] <sena_kun> RubioTerra, what OS do you use?

[13:35] <RubioTerra> Fedora Linux

[13:35] <sena_kun> RubioTerra, can you paste your "perl6 --version" output?

[13:35] <RubioTerra> Hmm... maybe it's SELinux blocking the connection...

[13:36] <RubioTerra> Let me disable it

[13:37] <RubioTerra> It is in permissive mode already

[13:38] <timotimo> i wonder if it's localhost vs 127.0.0.1 or ipv4 vs ipv6, even though it's just on loopback

[13:38] <[Coke]> (lock on building doc site) pretty sure this already has a lock.

[13:38] <sena_kun> we use "localhost", if RubioTerra has latest release.

[13:39] <RubioTerra> tcpdump shows that moar is resetting the connection

[13:40] <timotimo> ah

[13:40] <timotimo> we can get some more debug info out of it

[13:40] <sena_kun> RubioTerra, what's your `perl6 --version`?

[13:40] <timotimo> please set the MDS_NETWORK and MDS_PROTOCOL environment variables for the run config you're using to debug

[13:40] <RubioTerra> "This is Rakudo version 2018.06-276-gbb6a6f80b built on MoarVM version 2018.06-329-g21ea40f6"

[13:40] <timotimo> to 1 or yes or anything true-ish

[13:40] *** mephinet left
[13:41] <sena_kun> hmm, sounds fresh enough to me.

[13:42] <[Coke]> (lock on building docs) - it's in the cron job: */5     *       *       *       * PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin flock -n ~/update.lock -c ./doc/util/update-and-sync > update.log 2>&1

[13:42] <RubioTerra> @timotimo, I've set the variables and no luck

[13:43] <timotimo> it should spit out more stderr in the output window, does it?

[13:43] <timotimo> at least something like "responding to suspend request"?

[13:43] <RubioTerra> I now gives a new message: "thread 1 reacting to suspend request"

[13:43] <RubioTerra> but still timeout

[13:45] <timotimo> right, that message more or less only means the debug env vars have worked

[13:45] *** xq left
[13:46] <RubioTerra> I've run into the same problem on my Windows machine

[13:46] <RubioTerra> But Iet's focus on linux for now... :)

[13:47] <timotimo> you think you can strace the moar process that gets started by comma?

[13:47] <sena_kun> unfortunately, it was discovered that for Windows debug was broken. It is already fixed and will be in next release.

[13:47] <RubioTerra> good!

[13:47] <RubioTerra> let me try strace

[13:47] <timotimo> that could tell us what makes the connection reset happen

[13:49] <RubioTerra> hmm... the problem is, once I click debug it tries to create another instance of moarvm

[13:49] <timotimo> ah, it basically immediately dies and takes the moar process down with it?

[13:50] <timotimo> ah, it doesn't retry connecting

[13:50] <timotimo> a quick fix for this is to use the perl6 module App::MoarVM::Debugger, which is a CLI

[13:50] <RubioTerra> The moar instance stays running, but Comman doesn't try to reconnect

[13:51] <sena_kun> hmm, the thing is we do try to reconnect for 5 times iirc with increasing intervals. So this is odd.

[13:52] <RubioTerra> Let me try the debug module

[13:52] <RubioTerra> @sena_kun, it doesn't seem to be trying to reconnect

[13:53] <sena_kun> that sounds like an issue, yes.

[13:56] <RubioTerra> 'nc localhost 9999' connects ok

[13:56] <sena_kun> RubioTerra, can you please leave a feedback describing this issue on the site, so we could focus on it among other features/fixes before next release?

[13:56] <RubioTerra> Yes

[13:56] <sena_kun> RubioTerra++

[13:58] <RubioTerra> I'll try App::MoarVM::Debugger later to get more info

[13:58] <El_Che> RubioTerra: in case you want to test against an alternative rakudo, there are fedora packages

[13:58] *** mrdside left
[13:58] <RubioTerra> By the way, I'm using rakudobrew, it should make no difference, right?

[13:58] <sena_kun> it should.

[13:58] <El_Che> RubioTerra: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[13:58] *** mcmillhj left
[13:59] <RubioTerra> hm

[13:59] <El_Che> RubioTerra: I don't expect any difference

[13:59] <sena_kun> using linux distribution packages are preferred though for users.

[17:56] <raschipi> I hope he comes back

[17:56] <Zoffix> .oO( he? )

[17:58] <raschipi> sorry, I'm not used to languages where words are gendered that strongly

[17:58] <raschipi> My language has feminine and neutral genders, I mean neutral.

[18:00] <Zoffix> When I first came to #perl6, I made it a point to not reveal my gender and for several months I amused myself everyone assuming I was a "he" :)

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> we suck :)

[18:05] <timotimo> i generally make an effort to use gender-neutral pronouns, i consider it polite

[18:05] <tadzik> pronouns are silly

[18:06] <tadzik> and I can relate to raschipi, in Polish "user" is a male, so that's the connection in my head as well: "he left, maybe he comes back"

[18:06] <alexghacker> they're the real world equivalent of the '^' twigil

[18:07] <timotimo> in lojban the letter-words are usually used for pronouns

[18:07] <tadzik> well, but you do have ^ for all variables, not ^ for some and + for others for absolutely no reason other than hystorical :)

[18:07] <timotimo> i.e. i would refer to tadzik as "tee"

[18:07] <timotimo> or as alex as "eh" i guess?

[18:07] <lizmat> .oO( looking forward to e neural gender )

[18:08] <tadzik> I'd like e, or any alternative to the current situation for that matter

[18:08] <tadzik> we could also take ≈ùi from Esperanto, as it kind of sounds like both :)

[18:09] <raschipi> Just use he as gender neutral, solved.

[18:10] <AlexDaniel> heh‚Ä¶ :) um‚Ä¶ not really

[18:10] <tadzik> I imagine it'd piss off a similar amount of people as if you'd use "she" for everyone

[18:10] <tadzik> and pissing people off, even if for the right reason, is no way to convince people of anything

[18:12] <raschipi> lizmat: I'm aware of the issues. Like I said, it was a pure translation problem, since it's how it works in Portuguese.

[18:12] <lizmat> raschipi: no worries  :-)

[18:12] <timotimo> oh, my previous statement may be interpreted to say people are rude if they don't default to "they"

[18:13] <lizmat> but perhaps we should start using "e" from now on, saves on typing as well :)

[18:13] <El_Che> using "it" for a person is way weirder, though

[18:13] <El_Che> even if well intended

[18:13] <tadzik> it baffles me that people tend to complicate things to no visible end in an attempt to make everyone happy instead of trying to simplify things instead

[18:13] <lizmat> said e

[18:13] <lizmat> what e said

[18:13] <Zoffix> ùëí :)

[18:13] <tadzik> we're all equals, let's move behind this silly differenciation and move on. "e" is great!

[18:14] <Zoffix> I like what e said :)

[18:14] <timotimo> i like e, but they is already better understood

[18:14] * tadzik frowns at http://pronoun.is/

[18:14] <El_Che> isn't that the depressed singer from The Eels

[18:14] <El_Che> ?

[18:14] <tadzik> I find they confusing as it's wired in my head as something plural

[18:15] <El_Che> it *is* plueal

[18:15] <El_Che> plural

[18:15] <timotimo> now you sound like the fellow who was upset that people use "you" as singular

[18:15] <tadzik> hehe

[18:15] <timotimo> you is plural, you bleeps, use thou like any other normal person FFS

[18:15] <El_Che> the plural is for kings and queens, but I am a non-US republican :)

[18:15] <tadzik> well, I don't have that problem with "you" because I've seen it in both contexts for 25 years :)

[18:16] <timotimo> if you can learn a new javascript framework every three hours, you can learn a new pronoun every couple years

[18:16] <El_Che> I will refer with the pronoun the person in question prefers, but I won't generalise that for all my generic utterances

[18:16] <El_Che> it's a compromise that seems to work

[18:17] <tadzik> timotimo: ah, but I don't want to learn all those new JS frameworks either :P

[18:17] <tadzik> maybe let's just use $ for singular and @ for plural universally...? ;)

[18:17] <El_Che> I also try to switch in texts between he and she

[18:17] <timotimo> didn't mean to stick you into a too general category there

[18:19] <El_Che> same

[18:19] <El_Che> oh crap

[18:19] <raschipi> My problem with made up pronoums is that it's offensive to trans people.

[18:20] <lizmat> timotimo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90qX16aWwEY

[18:20] <raschipi> For some of them, the ones that don't buy into it.

[18:21] <tadzik> oh, now we're getting into "made up words" :)

[18:21] <timotimo> huh, this is the first time i hear that

[18:21] <timotimo> but pronouns are for more than just cis and trans people, they're also for genderqueers, genderfluid, agender, etc

[18:21] *** |oLa| joined
[18:21] <raschipi> Denies them their own gender, giving them a defective gender that's not either male of female.

[18:22] <timotimo> but trans people are free to use she or he if they want?

[18:22] <El_Che> The trans people I have met in the Perl community seemed very nice and not too preocupied with pronouns. You use what they prefer out of respoect and you continue talking.

[18:23] <tadzik> most reasonable people work like that :)

[18:24] <raschipi> Getting hang up on it is very rude indeed.

[18:26] <tadzik> I'm all for people being addressed in the way they prefer, as El_Che says, out of respect. But the moment we try to accomodate everyone with their own pronoun it just gets crazy complicated for no good reason. Wasn't the goal to treat everyone equally instead of specialcasing?

[18:27] <El_Che> That doesn not mean that I mimic the vocabulary like "cis" and the like. I just find important that person feels welcome and accepted (as (s)he is)

[18:27] <timotimo> there's a difference between equality and equity that i think applies here

[18:27] <tadzik> I'm looking at https://github.com/witch-house/pronoun.is/pulls, people request additions of "yo", "vi", "shi" etc

[18:27] <timotimo> take it from this perspective: everybody has an equal right to be addressed in a manner that fits them

[18:27] *** sauvin left
[18:27] <tadzik> maybe it's time to take a step back and just admit that pronouns serve little purpose it practice

[18:27] <timotimo> if you call everybody "he" or "she", even those who refuse to be gendered, you're giving equality to those that "he" or "she" fits well

[18:28] <tadzik> we have language contructs to differenciate men from women, but not one race from another, one hair colour from another, one body type for another. You could say "oh then we should add them all", but maybe it's better to just drop them completely?

[18:28] <timotimo> we have language constructs that differentiate married from unmarried women

[18:28] <tadzik> timotimo: that's why I'd rather pick a new word so everyone's on even ground

[18:29] <tadzik> yeah, that's silly too, and I think it's getting less and less popular

[18:29] <El_Che> you'll loose some specificallity 

[18:29] <El_Che> that can be relevant on some ocastions

[18:29] <El_Che> and not in others

[18:29] <timotimo> to me, pronouns are more like first name / last name

[18:30] <timotimo> you're not going to say "we must drastically reduce the number of different last names in the world"

[18:30] <El_Che> I think many trans people want to be refered to the gender they feel and not a neutral pronoun

[18:30] <El_Che> it's also about identity

[18:30] <tadzik> no, but we're not advocating for everyone to use other people's full names at all times

[18:30] <El_Che> (in contrast with biological classification)

[18:30] <tadzik> you pick a short version because that's easiest

[18:30] <timotimo> what about nicknames

[18:31] <tadzik> those are especially handy with name collisions :)

[18:31] <timotimo> why isn't picking a pronoun that fits you just like picking a nickname that fits you

[18:31] <El_Che> in roman languages like italian, spanish and portuguese it's easy to pick the preferred pronoun

[18:31] <timotimo> likewise, forcing a nickname that doesn't fit someone is also rather rude

[18:31] <timotimo> this fits surprisingly well

[18:31] <El_Che> on germanic languages it's more difficult

[18:31] <tadzik> it's different if you expect people to use it at all times. I wouldn't go around correcting people from Tadeusz So≈õnierz to Tadeusz ‚Äûtadzik‚Äù So≈õnierz, that'd be silly

[18:32] <timotimo> except pronouns are usually shorter than both nicknames and full names

[18:32] <tadzik> I'd rather just have people skip the irrelevant parts as long as it's clear

[18:32] <El_Che> "I am happy" in those languages already carries gender, so it's easy to continue from there

[18:33] <tadzik> timotimo: I'm now thinking of pronoun being like a title :)

[18:33] <raschipi> Holy crap don't get me starded on the 'x' or '@' nonsense.

[18:34] <El_Che> lxs chichxs :)

[18:34] <raschipi> I have no problems with it, as long as it's something possible to pronounce, ffs. :)

[18:35] <timotimo> if it's only used in writing, it's fine if it's not pronouncable, imo

[18:35] <raschipi> It's annoying as heck, because I can't read what I can't pronounce.

[18:35] <timotimo> oh, OK

[18:35] <SmokeMachine> pronouns arent the only problem if you are not talking exclusively in english... there are languages (as portuguese) that every substantive is "male"  or "female"... and you use a different article for each of them

[18:36] <raschipi> No, in Portuguese the two genders are female or neutral. There are no male gendered words.

[18:36] <timotimo> yeah, in german it's a bit awkward, too

[18:37] <tadzik> curious how languages kept all these distinctions even though they tend to simplify themselves over time

[18:38] <sena_kun> timotimo, pronounce gives you info about, well, chromosomes and you can assume things based on that, that's why it is useful. as for e.g. skin color, it gives some small differences to assumptions, but not so drastically ones as biological sex does.

[18:38] <SmokeMachine> raschipi: or you could say you use the male article for neutral words, or that there are no neutral words...

[18:39] <sena_kun> of course, "assumption are wrong because you can make a mistake in 1% of cases", but if 99% are nice... that's better than nothing. of course, if you know a person, it is a different matter, but it is not always the case.

[18:39] <raschipi> If I tell you the the student is learning, is about a male or female student? Same in Portuguese.

[18:39] <tadzik> sena_kun: right, but we (socially) tend to assume less and less based on the biological sex. I guess it's fair to say (at least around you good people) that it's an objectively good thing :)

[18:39] <sena_kun> *assumptions

[18:39] <raschipi> that the*

[18:40] <SmokeMachine> raschipi: but in portugues "estudante" is a male word...

[18:40] <raschipi> It's not, it's a neutral word.

[18:40] <timotimo> it's even funner for words that don't make much sense to be gendered

[18:40] <SmokeMachine> you say: "o estudante"

[18:40] <timotimo> what is it about a table, or chair that makes it male? but a bench is female for some reason?

[18:40] <raschipi> Even 'o estudante' is neutral. It doesn't carry any gender information.

[18:40] <timotimo> a spoon is male, a fork is female, a knife is neuter?

[18:41] <raschipi> A colher, o garfo, a faca.

[18:41] <lizmat> .oO( there is no spork )

[18:42] <sena_kun> tadzik, we do, but biology is not, there are tons of differences between bodies disregarding what people want/think. :S

[18:42] <SmokeMachine> o: artigo masculino; a: artigo feminino

[18:42] <tadzik> sena_kun: right, but I think it's a worthy goal to disregard those more than underline them even more

[18:43] <tadzik> new pronouns for new gender variants seem to me like an effort to underline the differences even more

[18:44] <SmokeMachine> https://www.duolingo.com/comment/25262212/Portuguese-articles-O-A-OS-and-AS

[18:44] <tadzik> "it's not just a person, it's a transsexual person" -- I don't care! I'll treat them just the same anyway

[18:44] <raschipi> SmokeMachine: think about how people use them, you'll see 'o' is neutral.

[18:45] <timotimo> tadzik: there isn't a "pronoun for trans people", i don't think. pronouns are for everybody.

[18:45] <raschipi> Have to create new pronoums since they aren't really women/men is the message I hear.

[18:45] <tadzik> I think I understand the point of timotimo's, about them being a bit like nicknames

[18:45] *** vrurg left
[18:46] <SmokeMachine> call every one `it`

[18:46] <tadzik> but when someone is insisting on using a particular pronoun for them, it feels a bit like "it's ¬´Jackie Brown *PHD*¬ª to you, sir", and that's just silly and annoying

[18:46] <tadzik> (to me anyway)

[18:46] <sena_kun> tadzik, if you're about tons of quickly made up words for hundreds of new genders(except for XX, XY and trans people who do transition), then I agree with you 100%. But I personally don't think we should erase difference between XX and XY, it exists and it is useful.

[18:46] <SmokeMachine> (in portuguese there is no `it`)

[18:46] <raschipi> If we are to pick pronoums, 'His Majesty' is mine.

[18:46] <timotimo> i disagree about the useful between XX and XY

[18:47] <sena_kun> Or, rather, useful to know in some situations, like doctor, not "useful to be different".

[18:47] <tadzik> timotimo: right, I picked that as an example, perhaps an unfortunate one

[18:47] <[Coke]> "So, how about that Perl 6?"

[18:47] <tadzik> :)

[18:47] <raschipi> The topic police is here!

[18:47] <tadzik> $e for singular, @e for plural, it's settled then

[18:49] <[Coke]> I'm not your granddad, though.

[18:49] <raschipi> %e for cranky people

[18:50] <SmokeMachine> I am writing a ORM where $ means a relationship to-one, @ to-many and Im thinking of using % to many-to-many...

[18:50] <timotimo> i tend to take a "it's none of your business what's in my pants or genes" stance about pronouns, i think

[18:51] *** Scimon joined
[18:51] <timotimo> especially since there's not only XX and XY, but also X0, XXY, XXXY, XXXXY, and XYY

[18:51] <Scimon> Hi all.

[18:52] <raschipi> I agree, and I do think it's appropriate to ask people you are close to you to use your chosen pronoums. The problems arise when there's too many of them to keep track and when in more formal situations where they can attacrct unwanted attention.

[18:52] <raschipi> Hi Scimon 

[18:52] <timotimo> huh, women with more than 90% XY genes have given birth, eh?

[18:52] <jferrero> XYY == "superman"?

[18:52] <Scimon> The rabbit hole that is Windows Process fun gives getting deeper.

[18:52] <tadzik> SmokeMachine: so "we like them" becomes "%e like %em"? :)

[18:52] <timotimo> jferrero: sounds like "supermale" is the term used for it, but it's not a sensible description of the outcome

[18:53] <timotimo> btw, lojban has different words for "we (including you)" and "we (excluding you)"

[18:53] <timotimo> i've wished for that to be available in german a whole bunch of times

[18:53] <tadzik> that sounds useful

[18:53] <timotimo> when my parents would tell me "we're invited over to $foo's house tonight" i'd always have to ask "you or we?"

[18:53] <SmokeMachine> like: `class Post { has Person $.author`, `class Person { has @.posts` and `class Person { has Array[Comments] %.comments{Posts}`

[18:54] <jferrero> timotimo: Oh, yes! Superman is an alien...

[18:54] <timotimo> Scimon: i do not envy you for having to deal with that

[18:55] <timotimo> huh, there's historians who suggest that joan of arc may have been XY with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, that's fascinating

[19:04] <Scimon> So yeah.... special case city. Try it an see.

[19:04] <timotimo> at this point, it may be better to grab contorl of keyboard and mouse, add a new launcher to the desktop or task bar, double-click it, and delete it afterwards, then give control back

[19:05] <raschipi> I get annoyed when application double fork on Linux too. They're not supposed to do that.

[19:06] <raschipi> "Double fork". That's not how it's done on Windows, but it's somewhat analogous.

[19:10] <Scimon> I'm getting enough info to update the docs at least.

[19:10] <Scimon> As for InvokeEditor I'll just give a list of tested editors I guess.

[19:12] <geekosaur> I think Windows really wants you to use COM instead: send 'edit this file' to an editor object, wait for a response saying 'done'?

[20:26] <xinming> so, the slip thing will auto flat in array context?

[20:26] <SmokeMachine> yes

[20:26] <tyil> m: [1, |(2, 3), 4, (5, 6), [7,8]]

[20:27] <uzl> raschipi: I guess I just wanted to show the concept (and be more explicit) but you're right, it works fine out without it. Do you recommend removing?

[20:27] <xinming> now, it get me confused again, (5, 6) vs [7, 8]?

[20:27] <xinming> are they the same?

[20:27] <tyil> xinming: first is a list, other is an array iirc

[20:28] <tyil> lists are immutable, whereas arrays are mutable

[20:28] <xinming> I mean,  (5, 6) to be a @array, second to be a array in scalar.

[20:28] <xinming> Ok...

[20:28] <SmokeMachine> m: say (1, 2).^name; say [1, 2].^name

[20:28] <timotimo> putting $a<> into [ ] will give you a scalar container around it again

[20:28] <timotimo> because array

[20:28] <xinming> a bit understand now

[20:28] <raschipi> uzl: I do recommend removing it and then pointing them it adds -h and  --help automatically. It's confusing because those are acttually automatically generated.

[20:29] <tbrowder_> tyil: maybe, but i see extra paras as separate from the definition. they would expand the definition. when you look at common renderings of definitions the definition often follows the term on the same line, logically part of one para comprised of two parts. but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

[20:30] <xinming> Will need to think more to get more clear about this

[20:30] <tyil> most definitions would be only one para, sure

[20:30] <tyil> but it's not necessarily a single para

[20:31] <tyil> and .contents is already pretty standard I'd say

[20:31] <SmokeMachine> xinming: try to read about containers

[20:31] <tyil> Pod::Block::Named have a .name and a .contents

[20:31] <uzl> raschipi: Oh, great! I'll do that then.

[20:31] <tadzik> hah, I wrote that :) What a feeling

[20:32] <raschipi> uzl: Do you want to guess what it does or do you want me to tell you?

[20:32] <tyil> so I'd expect defn blocks to have a term and contents as well

[20:32] <tyil> then it doesnt matter if it contains 1 or multiple paras

[20:32] *** vrurg left
[20:33] <tyil> and it's in line with every other pod block as well

[20:41] <Util> uzl: "multiple dispatches" should be "multiple dispatch" in all three appearances. 

[20:41] <Util> The wording ending in "es" does not appear in any of our documentation.

[20:41] <Util> Re: `notice the lack of :` - You have explained that nuance quite well!

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> hmmm‚Ä¶

[20:44] <uzl> Util: I'll fix that. I tried to make as clear as possible because it wasn't obvious to me the first time I saw.

[20:45] <uzl> raschipi: not sure I understand what you mean ;).

[20:45] <uzl> Is it a rhetorical question?

[20:46] <raschipi> -h and --help are added automatically and send the USAGE message to standard output instead of standard error like when it doesn't recognize the parameters.

[20:48] <tyil> tbrowder_: we could open it as an issue on a perl 6 repo so we can get input from others as well

[20:52] *** pmurias left
[20:53] <uzl> raschipi: This is what I have to justify their inclusion in the USAGE message:

[20:53] <uzl> You might notice that we mention the `-h` (and `--help`) flags in the 

[20:53] <uzl> usage message which we didn't need to explicitly define because they 

[20:53] <uzl> are automatically generated.

[20:54] <raschipi> uzl: That's correct.

[20:55] <uzl> After that I have: 

[20:55] <uzl> If we execute prog.p6 with the `--help` (or `-h`) flag o provide no 

[20:55] <uzl> matching signature, we get the new usage message:

[20:55] <raschipi> yep

[20:56] <uzl> I'll go with that then. Thanks for the clarification!

[20:56] <raschipi> No need to mention it on the post, but to see the difference, try to pipe it into less with -h and then with incorrect usage.

[21:26] <MasterDuke> .tell uzl i would probably say "prepending : to each variable", since it comes before the variable name

[21:26] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to uzl.

[21:32] <MasterDuke> .tell uzl also, you have '$surname' in the aliases example signature, but use '$last-name' in the body of the routine

[21:32] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to uzl.

[21:33] <MasterDuke> .tell uzl oh, and you say two kinds of aliases, but both of your list items are numbered 1

[21:33] <yoleaux> MasterDuke: I'll pass your message to uzl.

[22:30] <sena_kun> SmokeMachine, you want to .ask jnthn after his vacation. :) Though I doubt about "right now"(today) for this particular sale. I am sure it involves some law/tax-related things to resolve. And COmma is still in its beta now.

[22:35] <tbrowder_> tyil: good idea, go for it. however, i‚Äôve beeb thinking more about the defn scaffolding in S26 and am not sure multiple paras are mentioned explicitlly, although the presence of a defn delimited block allows for that. also coloring my view is the dual nature of how the term can be defined versus how the definition can be defined. i think an explicit definition attribute more closely follows S26. maybe we should ask Damian?

[22:40] <tyil> tbrowder_: I think it would be good to ask him (or other people in general) to see what they think is right

[22:50] <tbrowder_> agree

[22:51] <SmokeMachine> sena_kun: thanks!

[22:52] <SmokeMachine> and does Comma highlight custom slang?

[22:53] <sena_kun> not sure about that. I'd bet at "no" as for now, but it's up to jnthn to look into it, he's the brave person behind lexer/parser.

[22:56] <sena_kun> for all months I've been developing various things, I've changed maybe 10 or something lines in grammar area, too scared. :P

[22:57] <timotimo> i tried once, it didn't go terribly well

[22:57] <timotimo> jnthn helped me, though, so it ended up working
