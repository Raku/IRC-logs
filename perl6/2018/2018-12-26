[08:11] <Woodi> is there slimmer match object representation ? in my small script reading and parsing file is bit faster then for loop over match object...

[08:13] *** atweiden-air left
[08:21] <jmerelo> Woodi: what do you mean by slimmer? If you want to extract information without regexes, there's some way to do that too... But regexes or grammars are the only ones that do the heavy lifting, and they return Matches

[08:35] <Woodi> jmerelo: I mean: when printing match object it is HUGE :)  then I interpolated this to big cost of parsing match object content

[08:39] <moritz> Woodi: $/.Str is much faster than $/.gist

[08:39] <jmerelo> Woodi: it's an object, you can work with it, map parts of it, whatever... https://docs.perl6.org/type/Match You can also convert it to string as moritz has just said.

[08:42] <Woodi> possibly converting match object content to string is slow down...

[08:45] <Woodi> for @($h<cs>) -> $c { push @cols, ~$c; }   that ~$c is .gist ?

[08:56] <jmerelo> Woodi: ~$c calls Str. You can use some of the other methods, like chunks or pairs. There are many ways to extract information from Match, some are faster than others.

[09:37] <Woodi> looks like pre-warming 'now' in BEGIN block (and using it) change timings for a lot. so looping over match object is faster then parsing

[19:41] <moritz> yes

[19:41] <timotimo> it actually is, yeah

[19:55] <melezhik> any way to omit complication / syntax check when run perl6 --doc path ?

[19:58] <timotimo> no, the program has to be parsed, and rakudo can only parse valid syntax

[19:58] <timotimo> though you can probably somehow do something about outputs it does

[19:58] <timotimo> if not, a bug will probably want to be filed

[20:01] <melezhik> thanks, will try to access pod inside my program -https://docs.perl6.org/language/pod#Accessing_Pod

[20:02] <melezhik> ahh , it will not  not help me ):  ... 

[20:05] <melezhik> actually it is not a bug ... I mean the program gets complied but it require some "use ..." 

[20:05] <melezhik> the problem is the program itself is executed though EVALFILE

[20:05] <melezhik> and does not declare any dependencies itself ((:

[20:06] <melezhik> so not doing  syntax check when perl6 --poc would be helpful , though not critical for me right now ...
