[03:48] <dduncan> I’m starting to get into Perl 6 again after several years’ away from paying much close attention.  I’m trying to understand the Mix type.  While I know its a generalization of Bag to support real-number weights, I’m unclear on some other things.  I found docs.perl6.org to not answer my questions.  The primary question is whether it supports negative weights (which Set and Bag do not).  If it does, then I assume Mix supports 

[03:48] <dduncan> generalizations of all the operators applicable to Bag, but in that case I wonder how some of them apply to negative weights.  For example, what is the generalized definition of Mix union and intersection?  With Bag it is the max/min of the 2 weights, but with Mix does that generalize to the most positive/negative of the 2 weights or the furthest/nearest to zero of the two or something else?  While intersection of negatives producing a 

[03:48] <dduncan> number with the greater absolute value may seem non-intuitive, maybe it is the most correct and consistent.  Also I would wonder the semantics of membership when negative weights are supported.  Thank you.

[03:51] *** saki left
[03:52] <dduncan> The Mix definition I saw said the weight is “a non-zero real number” but the various operators didn’t really explain the consequences of this for negative weights.

[03:56] *** spycrab0 left
[03:57] <dduncan> On the other hand, while having documentation is nice, since Rakudo is relatively mature now, I will simply see what its actual behavior is and go by that for my answers.

[04:17] <dduncan> Maybe its just me, but there doesn’t seem to be any clear way to find the public version control for Rakudo et al by way of perl6.org.  When I go to https://perl6.org/downloads/ the section on installing from source points to http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/ and that points to tarballs with the source, but no repositories.  I know its on Github for example but there’s no mention of these on either site that I could easily find.  

[04:17] <dduncan> is in contrast to many open source projects where a Github-or-other-repo url is easy to find.

[04:21] <[Coke]> dduncan: can you add an issue to https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues ?

[04:21] <dduncan> ok, I’ll look into that

[10:34] <pmurias> ^^ this doesn't seem a very desirable result

[10:36] <pmurias> hmm, or is it? because that number is actually shorter then a pretty one with a lot of 0's 

[10:41] <jnthn> It's becasue a literal with e in it is a Num, and so its precision is constrained to that of a floating point number

[10:41] <jnthn> So I suspect that's the closest representable number

[10:50] <pmurias> JavaScript throws an exception and refuses to do the conversion

[10:51] <pmurias> The number 1e+34 is not a safe integer and thus cannot be converted to a BigInt

[10:52] <AlexDaniel> if someone is using Nums then the Num itself is likely not accurate anyway, throwing an exception sounds a bit annoying

[15:24] <uzl> Hello all!

[15:26] <uzl> So I've been working in my first module ever and I'm not sure if I'm using Perl 6's best practices.  Hopefully, somebody can take a look at it and provide me with suggestions/advice.

[15:26] <uzl> P6 module: https://gitlab.com/uzluisf/enigma

[15:26] <uzl> The module is somewhat of a P6 port of this Python library: https://bitbucket.org/bgneal/enigma/

[15:29] <uzl> I'm also writing this post (https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/posts/perl6-oop-introduction/) and would like some proofreading.

[15:29] <uzl> I'll be back later.

[16:37] <MasterDuke> .tell uzl "but can we can" has an extra 'can', should be "but we can"

[17:18] <dpk> well, the server it’s running on has 24 GB of memory ... ;-)

[17:20] <Ven`> is class :: { has Typed @.array; } supposed to work?

[17:21] <Ven`> my very small tests seem to indicate that yes, but my program doesn't accept it.

[17:23] <Ven`> Type check failed in assignment to @!function; expected AST::Fn but got List ($(AST::Fn.new(name =>...)

[17:23] <Ven`> Not sure what goes wrong and getting a smaller version of the program hides the bug :\

[17:26] <tyil> Ven`: you can use `has Str @.array` for instance, which requires all elements in the array to be Str

[17:26] <Ven`> yeah, that's what I'm doing (`has AST::Fn @.function`)

[17:27] <MasterDuke> Ven`: that looks sort of like what you

[17:27] *** rfold joined
[17:28] <MasterDuke> 're assigning to it is a List that happens to contain AST::Fns

[17:28] <Ven`> well, even Array[AST::Fn].new(...) fails.

[17:28] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v rfold

[17:28] <MasterDuke> dpk: it doesn't seem to be accepting new .tells from me

[17:28] <Ven`> oh, I think I figured it out.

[17:29] <Ven`> m: class A { has Int @.xs; }; my %vals = xs => (1, 2, 3); A.new(xs => (1, 2, 3)); say "I survived!"; A.new(|%vals);

[17:35] <tyil> I think youre looking forthis

[17:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82755848c: OUTPUT: «I survived!␤»

[17:37] <Ven`> no, I'm not

[17:37] <tyil> m: class A { has Int @.xs; }; my %vals = xs => (1, 2, 3); A.new(xs => (1, 2, 3)); say "I survived!"; my $a = A.new(xs => |%vals<xs>); dd $a.xs;

[17:50] <Ven`> yeah it just adds a level of wrapping [] on top, it's completly broken. I have to list the keys

[17:50] <MasterDuke> dpk: i got that message, but yoleaux isn't replying saying "i'll pass your message..." when i try to .tell someone else (in a priv message to yoleax)

[17:50] <Ven`> m: class A { has Int @.xs; }; my %vals = xs => (1, 2, 3); say A.new(|%vals).perl;

[17:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82755848c: OUTPUT: «A.new(xs => [(1, 2, 3),])␤»

[17:50] <Ven`> note the double wrapping...

[17:52] <MasterDuke> m: class A { has Int @.xs; }; my %vals = xs => 1, 2, 3; dd A.new(xs => (1, 2, 3)).xs; dd A.new(|%vals).xs;

[17:53] <Ven`> ah, it's probably because in my grammar I have <foo>+ and so $<foo>>>.made is actually itemized for some reason

[17:53] <MasterDuke> m: class A { has Int @.xs; }; my %vals := xs => (1, 2, 3); dd A.new(xs => (1, 2, 3)).xs; dd A.new(|%vals).xs;

[21:19] <lichtkind> is there a way to breakup class into several files?

[21:24] <timotimo> you can use roles for that purpose

[21:24] <jnthn> Short answer: no. Long answer: if the class can be decomposed into various roles, put those in files and compose them into the class. Technically you could have a chain of files using each other and doing `augment`...but don't.

[21:24] *** TreyHarris left
[21:25] <jnthn> If a class is so incohesive that there's not value in having it all in the same place, it may also be a sign of poor design.

[21:27] <lichtkind> jnthn thanks and extra thanks for looking into my ticked 

[21:29] <lichtkind> jnthn, normally i would be of same opinion but its purpose of this module to give you all the base you need to deal with matrices so its gets very big, any attemt to outsoure some functionality so far failed due lack of acess to private attributes

[21:30] <lichtkind> timotimo, yes i have to look more into roles

[21:30] <lichtkind> timotimo, roles have access to private attributes of the class they mixed in?

[21:30] <timotimo> that is correct

[21:31] <lichtkind> thanks that would work than
