[04:00] <geekosaur> you are better off doing that part outside the regex. if for some reason it absolutely must be in the regex, you need to test what you've matched after matching it --- and you must prevent backtracking, or it will get past your "917" by matching "91"

[06:00] <TisonKun> Hi #perl6, I wonder how to define a class method. It look like method(ClassName:U:) { ... } works but get lost with "ClassName:U:" part, especially the latter ":", what it is?

[06:01] <tyil> TisonKun: from my experience that's not needed to put in anyway

[06:01] <tyil> just method($foo, $bar) { "Got a $foo and $bar" } would work fine

[06:01] <geekosaur> that's only if you want ametdo that does something different as a class method than as an instance method 

[06:01] <geekosaur> what it means is that the invocant (instance) is the class's type object

[06:02] <geekosaur> :U means the value provided must be undefined; the following colon separates the invocant from the other parameters. Normally you don't have an explicit invocant

[06:04] <geekosaur> er, want a method that does

[06:05] <geekosaur> hm, although I guess if you want a compile time error for using a class method on an instance, you might use that form of definition

[06:05] <TisonKun> thanks, like A.f(args) treated as if A::f(A, args), the latter colon separates the invocant

[06:06] <TisonKun> tyil: you are right, but here I want a more exactly method that must be invoked by a class, not instance.

[06:07] <tyil> also, anyone on the mastodons that have more knowledge of Cro to help this guy out: https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/100740628894585564 ?

[12:42] <pmurias> Ven`: to make use of the typescript definitions Perl 6 would have to have real gradual typing

[12:42] <Ven`> we do, we have Any :P.

[12:44] <pmurias> Ven`: isn't that dynamic typing?

[12:45] <masak> I think the `Any` thing was a joke, but...

[12:45] <masak> `any` in TypeScript means the lack of (static) typing, which I guess one could refer to as dynamic typing (only)

[12:46] <pmurias> Ven`: we could turn the typescript gradual typing into Perl6y runtime type assertions

[12:46] <Ven`> well, a Perl 6 runtime type assertion is a "$ where Foo" instead of "Foo $" for subs

[12:48] <pmurias> masak: doesn't mean something is weakly typed rather then dynamically typed checked in TypeScript

[12:48] <pmurias> ?

[12:49] <masak> "weakly typed" as in "type coercions happen instead of type mismatch errors"?

[15:17] <Zoffix> Ulti: 0.0000000000000001 is almost a maximum Rat denominator, so you'd have to switch to Num soon enough anyway. Currently, that operation follows the pattern that two different numerics get .Bridge'd (which in this case is to a Num)

[15:18] <Zoffix> Ulti: also things have a much better chance of being seen and addressed when they're filed as an Issue, rather than mentioned on a non-dev chat.

[15:19] *** sena_kun left
[15:20] <Zoffix> (INB4: while 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 is a Rat; it's a fattish Rat and basically all non-FatRat operations with it would degrade it to a Num, unless the result gets a chance to become less than 64-bit denominator. It'd violate the patter to produce a fattish rat through .round)

[15:20] *** Zoffix left
[15:23] <El_Che> since I retired a perl6 that ran in prod for 2 years (it was an app to help with the migration of a CA provider, query servers and bug users) because the migration was completed, I added our first perl 6 service on our internal cloud. As a byproduct there are now (internal) visible perl6 Docker base images :)

[15:23] <El_Che> who knows :)

[15:24] <timotimo> \o/

[15:26] <El_Che> the funny detail is that this is a smallish script that monitors oracle jdk releases and puts the rpms in our internal artefact repo :)

[15:26] <El_Che> so our Java images are brought to you by Rakudo Perl 6 (TM)

[15:26] <El_Che> :)

[15:29] <AlexDaniel> yesterday I had to talk to people about perl¬†6

[15:29] <AlexDaniel> and the confusion that comes because of its name is very strong‚Ä¶

[15:29] *** kurahaupo joined
[15:30] <El_Che> I am too nice to say "no shit, Sherlock" (however, I may be sneaku enough to imply it)

[15:30] <El_Che> jk

[15:30] <El_Che>  /o\

[15:30] <AlexDaniel> one thing that I noticed is that even if you explain the whole thing about perl5 and perl¬†6, people still keep referring to it as ‚Äúperl‚Äù

[15:30] <AlexDaniel> maybe because it's easier to pronounce, I don't know

[15:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[15:30] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it's because they are normal

[15:31] <El_Che> and can count sequentially

[15:31] <El_Che> :)

[15:31] <El_Che> it's a lost battle

[15:31] <AlexDaniel> but then someone else joins the discussion, hears ‚Äúperl‚Äù and then it's even harder to unconfuse it

[15:31] <El_Che> I just say Rakudo

[15:31] <El_Che> except to people that know perl

[15:31] <ofperfection[m]> Yeah, I'm excited for the rebranding effort

[15:32] <El_Che> don't hold your breath

[15:32] <ofperfection[m]> When my cohorts here I'm using perl there is usually some eye rolling or wincing

[15:32] <ofperfection[m]> hard to get people excited about it

[15:32] <El_Che> yeah, people use it as banter at work

[15:33] <El_Che> me being the perl guy (because of the lack of other candidates) :)

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> yeah, my day was unnecessarily hard yesterday because of the damn name‚Ä¶ and I really hope we can fix that so that others don't have to feel the same way

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> on a related note, my university changed its name

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> well, its short name to be precise

[15:33] <El_Che> it's good that I can troll the rubyst with the same arguments

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> not entirely sure why, but it was weird, confusing and sucked anyway

[15:34] <El_Che> "Oh, haven't we moved that ruby code to go yet?"

[15:34] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: political parties around here change their names once in a while

[15:34] <El_Che> and sadly enough it works

[15:34] <ofperfection[m]> oof

[15:34] <El_Che> ("I don't want to live in this planet any more" :) )

[15:36] <AlexDaniel> .tell Zoffix I hope the alias thingie is still part of the plan for v6.d. Pleaaaase. http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-09-18#l498

[15:36] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[15:36] <ofperfection[m]> +1

[15:37] <El_Che> my I should add a "ln -s /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/perl6 /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/rakudo" to the Linux pkg build scripts :)

[15:37] <El_Che> so people do "#!/usr/bin/env rakudo" :)

[15:37] <AlexDaniel> that totally makes sense and is not related to the alias anyway

[15:38] <AlexDaniel> maybe I want to have more than one compiler installed and I want to run something specifically with rakudo

[15:38] *** domidumont left
[15:38] <El_Che> while my pkgs are opniated (they include zef) I don't want to start a war 

[15:39] <AlexDaniel> but maybe rakudo itself should produce a `rakudo` executable?

[15:39] <diakopter> but,.. a war with whom? who might realistically object

[15:39] <AlexDaniel> along with a `perl` one

[15:39] <diakopter> heh

[15:39] <AlexDaniel> or one symlinked to another

[15:39] <El_Che> (I am contemplating adding the needed libs for a working repl, thought?)

[15:39] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: that would be the pratical renaming, e.g. as output for -v as well

[15:40] <El_Che> that is way further than an alias though

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> huh? why?

[15:41] <El_Che> if even perl6{.exe} calls itself rakudo, then it will be the main name

[15:41] <El_Che> in my eyes

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> ???

[15:41] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 19edeafd1: OUTPUT: ¬´Stub code executed‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/98uO7XzRD4 line 1‚ê§¬ª

[15:41] <AlexDaniel> name of the compiler, yes

[15:41] <El_Che> I C

[15:41] <El_Che> good enough

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: or if not, then let's say I want to install rakudo along with another perl6 compiler

[15:42] <El_Che> make the main one 'rakudo' and smaller ones 'rakudo-js' or something?

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> then how can I differentiate?

[15:42] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: install path?

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: ok, but what does that mean?

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> so I do apt install rakudo

[15:42] <AlexDaniel> and then apt instal oenuhoneuh

[15:43] <AlexDaniel> I'd get the other one uninstalled because they both want to be `perl6`, no?

[15:43] <El_Che> apt-cache search perl

[15:43] <El_Che> "shall I install the old one or the most recent one?"

[15:43] <El_Che>  /civil-war-started-by-debian

[15:44] <El_Che> while apt-cache search rakudo doesn't have that effect

[15:44] <AlexDaniel> ok, actually, I guess I'm not qualified to have an opinion on that :)

[15:45] <AlexDaniel> maybe we should ask domidumont or robertle

[15:45] <diakopter> I have not heard of this oenuhoneuh

[15:45] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: this is the Internet (no one knows you're a dog)

[15:46] <El_Che> (In case the reference is lost: http://assets.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/na-internetu-niko-ne-zna-da-ste-pas.png)

[15:47] <El_Che> diakopter: it's like rakudo, but faster and with a syntax close to Perl 5.

[15:47] <diakopter> google returns no results

[15:47] <El_Che> diakopter: it will be announce in Riga

[15:47] <El_Che> by AlexDaniel 

[15:48] <diakopter> how is it like rakudo if it has a syntax close to Perl 5

[15:48] <ofperfection[m]> All the current learning materials assume Rakudo syntax do they not

[15:48] <El_Che> ofperfection[m]: there is only rakudo

[15:49] <AlexDaniel> the announcement will include a tutorial on how to come up with a good name by hitting the home row keys on a Dvorak layout :)

[15:51] <El_Che> I don't think it's a good idea

[15:52] <El_Che> "best viewed with Rakudo 6.d-moarvm-js-Internet Explorer 1024x768"

[15:53] <El_Che> do you guys remember the oracle jdk renaming?

[15:53] <El_Che> (and girls)

[15:53] <Zoffix> FWIW: There was already a pumpking-rejected ticket on renaming the executable R#2095

[15:53] <synopsebot> R#2095 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2095 [6.d review][build] Do not use `perl6` as executable

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> oh, right

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> so you can probably use perl6-m to mean rakudo on moar

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> fine :)

[15:58] <El_Che> well the single entrypoint does not help is the reason to change it is the "perl" en "6" part

[15:58] <El_Che> *if

[15:58] <diakopter> someone help me understand what is this new perl6?

[15:59] <El_Che> it helps with the discussion about the compiler ecosystem in the future

[15:59] <[Coke]> regarding perl6 vs. rakudo executables. It's my understanding that are already some packages that provide that prior art; that if you install 2 things that provide a service, the package installs cooperate so you can choose which one gets the real name, but both get their own name.

[15:59] <El_Che> like alternatives in Linux?

[16:00] <[Coke]> ISTR that pmichaud has mentioned that before. that seems like a very reasonable thing for a rakudo package to do.

[16:00] <El_Che> it does so by setting syslinks to the correct path

[16:00] <El_Che> what about the ln -s perl6 rakudo idea?

[16:00] <El_Che> bbl train arrived

[16:01] * [Coke] reads http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/alternatives.htm sure. No idea if pacakage managers support the aliases out of the box or if you'd have to do it yourself as the pkg mgr.

[17:58] <CIAvash[m]> pmurias: qutebrowser which uses webengine which uses chromium. I'm not on my computer right now, I can try it on Firefox tomorrow.

[18:05] <pmurias> CIAvash[m]: rakudo.js uses native BigInts which as far as I know don't work in firefox yet

[18:07] <pmurias> CIAvash[m]: I test it on newish chrome, it seems likely the didn't upgrade V8 in qutebrowser yet

[18:07] <pmurias> CIAvash[m]: anyway thanks a lot for helping to make the parcel bundling part portable

[18:12] <CIAvash[m]> pmurias: that's probably it, webengine is usually behind chrome. No problem.

[18:18] <pmurias> I didn't invest (much) time into portability for browsers with non-cutting edge features for rakudo.js as it's a problem that goes away with time

[18:18] <pmurias> ;)

[18:20] <CIAvash[m]> üòÉ

[18:24] <El_Che> pmurias: isn't pretty much the point of a JS port portability?

[18:24] <El_Che> (as when ready, not when work in progress, I mean)

[18:25] <pmurias> El_Che: when ready it will make sense to spend some time to all the popular browsers

[18:27] <El_Che>  yes, that's what I mean, not now

[18:27] <El_Che> but must not be forgotten then :)

[18:27] <El_Che> I don't want to hear rakudo active X jokes :)

[18:28] <El_Che> pmurias: do you still post about the port? 

[18:28] <El_Che> I remember some post on blog.perl.org, iirc

[18:28] <pmurias> I'll write on soonish now that I have something reportable ;)

[18:29] <El_Che> looking forward to it

[19:52] <sarna> I didn't see Perl 6 there

[19:53] <AlexDaniel> maybe they count perl5 and perl¬†6 as the same thing

[19:53] <sarna> so I shot them an email, Perl 6 is gonna be included the next time :)

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> heh that graph may be a bit misleading

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> KiCad is not a programming language :)

[19:55] <sarna> well, it's not ideal

[19:55] <sarna> more accurate than TIOBE though, in my opinion

[23:24] <timotimo> hi Xliff, hi k_89 

[23:24] <Xliff> timotimo.

[23:25] <Xliff> Are there any plans on getting $=pod Pod::Block::Named structures into something easier to access than an array?

[23:25] <Xliff> Thinking something like %=pod<data> would give me a Str of data if only one section was defined... or an Array if there were more.

[23:25] <timotimo>  haven't touched pod in a looooong time

[23:25] <Xliff> LOL

[23:25] <Xliff> Just looking through it and was wondering why it is all in an _array_ of all things. 

[23:25] <timotimo> i could imagine that working, especially as many items pretend to be an array of one item

[23:26] <Xliff> But easiest implementation wins.

[23:26] <timotimo> could be because it's supposed to be ordered?

[23:26] <Xliff> How would one get access to $=pod from outside its scope?

[23:27] <Xliff> I would assume that was made difficult for good reasons.

[23:27] <timotimo> hm, you mean $=pod variables are kind of lexically scoped?

[23:27] <Xliff> Yeah. Would like to see if writing a module to get all of the Pod::Block::Named sections into a hash would be possible.
