[10:08] <Kaiepi> anyone with libidn2 and not on *bsd got a minute to test something for me?

[10:08] <Kaiepi> i want to check if an issue i'm having with one of its perl 6 bindings is a problem specific to my os or not

[10:09] <moritz> Kaiepi: I'm on Ubuntu Linux and can install libidn2-0

[10:09] *** eliasr joined
[10:11] <Kaiepi> can you install https://github.com/Kaiepi/p6-Net-LibIDN2 and try running Net::LibIDN2.check_version ?

[10:11] <Kaiepi> it segfaults for me when moar's built with either dyncall or libffi, but i can't see any obvious issue with the code itself

[10:18] <Kaiepi> change the sprintf string to '%02%020000' at this line https://github.com/Kaiepi/p6-Net-LibIDN2/blob/master/lib/Net/LibIDN2.pm6#L11

[10:18] <moritz> # Failed test 'LibIDN2 v2.0.0 or greater must be installed!'

[13:57] <perlawhirl> lizmat: one more question if you don't mind. say i'm in a while loop (eg. i = k; i > 0; i--) nqp-style... can i "break" out of the loop early and  retain the `i` value

[13:57] <perlawhirl> i kinda worked around it by assigning `i` to another var, and then using that after the while loop ended... but is there a better way

[13:58] <lizmat> can you break out of a loop in nqp ?

[13:58] <perlawhirl> yeh?

[13:58] <lizmat> ah, yeah

[21:11] <lichtkind> moritz: i was coauthor of a module and want to get my latest fixes into the main line and i was thinking about taking it it over

[21:14] <lichtkind> or does anybody know her ehow to contact pierre vigier ? thanks

[21:14] <lizmat_> lichtkind: you don't need to steal anything: just upload one under your name

[21:14] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[21:15] <moritz> lichtkind: how did you manage to co-author a module with somebody you don't know how to contact?

[21:15] <lichtkind> moritz,: becasue for a time he accepted by patches

[21:16] <lichtkind> lizmat, hejho sure but how to set the module adress to my account?

[21:16] <lichtkind> lizmat i rather talk to him but he doesnt reacted to patch since month 

[21:16] <lichtkind> or two

[21:18] <lizmat> lichtkind: what is the module address ?

[21:18] <lizmat> what do you mean by that?

[21:18] <lichtkind> https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix

[21:19] <lizmat> you can also upload your version of the module to CPAN

[21:19] <lizmat> and zef will find it

[21:19] <lichtkind> i dont want really stal something but i gotta do something since my last patch is just pure maintanance

[21:20] <lizmat> http://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Mi6:cpan:SKAJI

[21:20] <lichtkind> lizmat so zef prefers CPAN or zef can handle several sources?

[21:20] <lichtkind> ah

[21:20] <lichtkind> thanks

[21:20] <lizmat> zef handles multiple sources

[21:20] *** epony left
[21:21] <lizmat> not sure which one it will take if it finds two

[21:21] <lizmat> but then the person installing will just need ton specify your :auth

[21:21] <lichtkind> meaning author
