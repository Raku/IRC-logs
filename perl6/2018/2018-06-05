[06:48] <nine> .ask moritz I wonder what's so different about the German implementation of the GDPR which makes it impossible to host the IRC logs. I've spent the last couple of months with this regulation and don't really see a deal breaker there

[06:48] <yoleaux> nine: I'll pass your message to moritz.

[06:48] *** kurahaupo joined
[06:52] *** andrzejku_ left
[06:53] <moritz> nine: since I'm only familiar with the German implementation, I can't tell you the differences

[06:54] *** andrzejku joined
[06:54] <nine> Fair enough but what in German law prevents you from hosting the log?

[06:54] <moritz> nine: if you don't see risks, you're welcome to run the software; I'll happily provide you the configuration files I used

[06:55] <moritz> nine: I need consent before I process or store PII

[06:56] <moritz> and I don't see an airtight way to obtain consent from the people in the channels that I log, much less from the people about whom they might share PII

[06:56] <sjn> isn't IRC considered a public space?

[06:57] <moritz> dunno; IANAL, which is why I'm not taking such risks

[06:59] *** lizmat joined
[06:59] *** domidumont left
[07:00] <nine> The only maybe PII in the IRC logs are the nicknames which are pseudonyms. Anyway article 2 (2) c) explicitly excludes processing by a natural person for private purposes. The logs were not hosted by a company, were they?

[07:01] *** HaraldJoerg joined
[07:02] <moritz> nine: if I wrote something about the sexual preference of somebody else on IRC, that is most certainly PII

[07:03] <moritz> anyway, I'm not continuing this discussion; if you don't see risks, either host it yourself, or arrange a consultation with a lawyer that convinces me

[07:04] <moritz> I'll happily assist in setting up ilbot installations

[07:04] <nine> I am considering both options :)

[07:52] <jmerelo> The problem are not so much nicks as the association of nicks to IPs. Also the fact that someone is connected, or not, at a particular time. Just check the latest messages. We know that Schepeers has connected from 177.70.169.55

[07:53] <jmerelo> I can connect that to their service providers, and it wouldn't be too difficult to associate that to a person.

[07:54] <jmerelo> So we thank moritz for the service provider so far, and I understand perfectly his move.

[07:56] *** zakharyas left
[07:56] *** zakharyas joined
[07:57] <El_Che> jmerelo: so, anonymising IP's is enough? moritz point was that he could not monitor when people type personal data (eg an adress in a message)

[07:57] <jast> a nation-wide hardware store has adopted a new policy to no longer make speaker announcements about things like lost wallets, badly parked (or damaged) cars etc., due to potential PII

[07:57] <jast> personally I think that's over the top, but it's definitely a topic that is getting a lot of attention

[07:58] <El_Che> jast: that's crazy. it's about holding date

[07:58] <El_Che> it's ok if they don't keep in in a db

[07:58] <El_Che> for ever en ever and spam the ppot guy with ads about wallets

[07:58] <jast> it's not just about holding it, it's also about "processing" it

[07:59] <jast> I don't know whether making an announcement is a type of processing, but evidently they've decided to go maximum paranoia

[07:59] <El_Che> they are intellectually lazy

[08:00] *** zakharyas1 joined
[08:00] <jast> no, I think it's excess caution, of the "there's a non-zero probability we might get sued for billions" variety

[08:00] <jmerelo> El_Che: I think so. But as long as personal data is stored, GDPR says the person can ask for it to be removed and searched. That's a burden that he can't possibly take.

[08:01] *** zakharyas left
[08:02] <jast> anyway, my favourite fallout of GDPR is sites that have started displaying a huge "click here to accept your tracking and ads" before you see their content

[08:02] <El_Che> jmerelo: does a nick count as a name

[08:02] <El_Che> ?

[08:03] <jmerelo> El_Che: if it can be associated to a name or an IP, it might.

[08:03] <El_Che> that's not the same level

[08:04] <El_Che> what's coutns as personal information is name, sex, age, religion, politics, etc

[08:05] <jmerelo> El_Che: no, rather things like IP, address, any VAT numbers, things like that.

[08:05] <jmerelo> And I guess the point is if you get to the coordinates, you can easily get to the other things

[08:06] <El_Che> yes, IP is personal

[08:06] <El_Che> correlation isn't

[08:06] <El_Che> it's still protected

[08:06] <El_Che> but not on the same level

[11:56] <n1ge> it's a bit of a bummer about the irclog being lost - I understand though about the GDPR question

[11:57] <n1ge> hmm - I wonder if you could get consent - even then you would need to provide a way for a user to delete their records

[11:58] <tadzik> I think the problem is retroactively getting consent from people who you know only by IRC nicknames

[11:59] <DrEeevil> "by joining this channel you agree" ;)

[12:00] <tadzik> from now on, perhaps ;)

[12:00] *** wamba left
[12:00] <tadzik> not quite explicit enough for GDPR though

[12:02] <nige> the logging service could manage the consents I suppose going into the future

[12:02] <nige> there would need to be some sort of authentication combined with the nick

[12:04] <nige> a new incoming channel user could get a private message with an invitation to log their contribution

[12:05] <nige> you would have to sync the nicks in the irc channel and those used by the loggin service

[12:06] <nige> as there is no guaranteed one to one relationship there between irc nick and web log - this could make is a non-starter I suppose

[12:14] <nige> if someone did come in and started using your nick (and leaving log messages) - then the originating nick owner would be able to purge the log - so that could work

[12:16] *** jmerelo left
[12:20] <nige> yes - I think that could work - the bot asks first time nick users to opt in for logging by consent by private message

[12:21] <masak> or you just have to shout I CONSENT TO BEING LOGGED on channel

[12:21] <huf> what if a nonlogged person says something and a logged person quotes them

[12:21] <huf> they'd get logged even though they didnt consent

[12:22] <masak> the logged person would have to pay royalties

[12:22] <nige> yes - that would be unfriendly I suppose

[12:22] <huf> the bot would have to log everything secretly so it can compare new lines to old ones

[12:22] <huf> to see if they're quotes :)

[12:23] <masak> reminds me of the xkcd-related channel where you got kicked by a bot if you said something that had been said before

[12:23] <tadzik> "hello!"

[12:25] <nige> tricky problem :-)

[12:25] <masak> tadzik: it's just a kick, it's not a kickban ;)

[12:25] <masak> tadzik: "feel free to stop by and say 'hello!' anytime!" :P :P :P

[12:26] <tadzik> masak: "stop by, for a moment" ;)

[12:26] <nige> masak - the shout thing is quite good as it lets other members know the person is logging

[12:27] <nige> hmm - what about bots though - do we ask them for consent? ;-)

[12:27] <masak> tadzik: "putting the 'relay' back in IRC" :D

[12:27] <tadzik> robot rights are still being neglected

[12:27] <masak> in #perl6's defense, though, this is the most bot-friendly place I know

[12:28] <tadzik> we like to talk about how important accesibility, and at the same time we're actively hostile to some of the less fortunate beings

[12:28] <tadzik> "prove that you're a human" -- seriouslY!?

[12:28] <masak> "we're nice because Matz^WLarry is nice. the bots are nice because we're nice"

[12:28] <nige> as we're currently log free we can say whatever we like about the bots - and the drones won't get dispatched ;-)

[12:28] <masak> including botist slurs

[12:29] <nige> peace bots

[12:29] <masak> releasable6: you're a tin can

[12:29] <releasable6> masak, I cannot recognize this command. See wiki for some examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Releasable

[12:30] * masak taps dalek rudely on the shell

[12:30] <masak> yoleaux: tell yourself that you're not eligible for the Turing test

[12:31] * masak remembers that according to H2G2, the most passive-aggressive thing you could do to a digital being was to count, slowly

[12:33] <tadzik> . o O ( you know that I am called the count... )

[12:34] <masak> tadzik: I love how there's (apparently) hordes of people who watched the Count when they were young, and then just one day in adulthood, out of a clear blue sky, got the pun :D

[12:41] <masak> it only goes to show how censoring can make [REDACTED] so much more [REDACTED]

[12:42] <masak> speaking of which, if you're on a plane to Saudi Arabia and get to pick a movie, do not pick "Kingsman". it makes much less sense when it's cut that much.

[12:42] <tadzik> oh? What was offensive about that film?

[13:37] <jonathon> Hi! I've been using "install-dist.pl" to install zef 0.3.1 into /usr/share/perl6/vendor, but with 0.4.3 this no longer works as expected, and, when run, zef complains about a "Missing or wrong version of dependency". Running `perl6 -Ilib zef` works fine however. Is there a "new" way to perform system-wide module installation?

[13:37] <yoleaux> 15 Dec 2017 16:44Z <Zoffix> jonathon: doesn't seem like any good hints for reasons in your build failure. Do you have enough memory to build? You need about 1.3GB of RAM/swap for rakudo (though I think those failures manifest differently). We already have pre-built Ubuntu packages. You could just use them: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases

I am currently playing with install-dist.pl to install perl6 packages in debian. would be great to know of possible problems. it's interesting that intalling zef doesn't work, isn't zef "just" more perl6 code? do you understand why it does not work?

[14:49] <stmuk> I'm fairly certain install-dist.pl *used* to install zef since I did consider using it to install zef in star

[14:49] <jonathon> robertle, install-dist.pl has worked well up until now for every p6 module thrown at it (see e.g. all the perl6 modules on aur.archlinux.org)

[14:49] <jonathon> i'll try older zef versions, then try with rakudo 2018.04

[15:17] <melezhik> how do I interpolate ::?module into string ?

[15:20] <melezhik> ok

[15:20] <ilmari> you can interpolate arbitrary code in strings with { ... }

[15:20] <melezhik> yeah

[15:20] <melezhik> thanks

[16:24] <jmerelo> But if anyone wants to help, I've slapped the "help wanted" tag on this issue https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/516

[16:28] <raschipi> I think Perl 6 should be split from perlmonks so that they eat all the newbs and the language choice becomes very clear for them.

[16:28] <raschipi> Bonus: fix the UI

[16:28] <El_Che> raschipi: doesn't the perl6 tag on SO do that already?

[16:29] <raschipi> Yes, but I'm talking about changing the rules there so that newbs are sent to SO instead.

[16:32] <El_Che> does debian package 3 pythons?

[16:33] <stmuk> ah I misread actually 2

[16:34] <El_Che> that's more likely :)

[16:34] <raschipi> another one in virtualenv and you're there.

[16:35] <geekosaur> there are a few things packaged that still want python 2.6. but I don't think a default install includes any
