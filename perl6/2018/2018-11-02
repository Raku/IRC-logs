[12:12] <tobs`> This is unexpected, isn't it?

[12:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e858c8d0: ( no output )

[12:16] <moritz> TIL: I don't understand how state initialization and topicalization interact

[12:17] <tobs`> Maybe this is related (though I don't understand much of it) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1467

[12:17] <tobs`> now if only I could remember how the bisect bot works

[12:18] <jnthn> Poorly. A state variable is assigned if the assignment takes place in the first execution of the block containing the state variable (strictly, of that closure clone)

[12:19] <jnthn> The thunking breaks the assumption that the assignment of a state variable and the scope it lives in will always take place in the same code object, thus leading to the observed behavior.

[12:20] <jnthn> m: state %e = (.antipairs with { :1ONE, :2TWO }); dd %e

[12:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8e858c8d0: OUTPUT: «Hash %e = {"1" => "ONE", "2" => "TWO"}␤»

[12:20] <jnthn> Do it like that

[12:21] <jnthn> Otherwise, even if somehow we found a way to let the thunking work, you'd still be wastefully running a `with` every time that will be a no-op

[12:21] <jnthn> (Well, except the first time)

[12:22] <tobs`> jnthn: thanks. The explanation is something to digest

[17:50] <poohman> it is some wierd format which ends up being downloaded

[17:51] <Zoffix> poohman: worth mentioning, the `prompt` thing is fairly new, available from 2018.08 rakudo (with earlier versions always giving you strings). You can use `val prompt` if you want to be sure , tho

[17:52] *** domidumont joined
[17:52] <Zoffix> poohman: jnthn and timotimo both work on that project and they would know more.

[17:52] <ugexe> i get it. but in this case there was a clear lack of understanding of what they were documenting

[17:52] <Zoffix> I don't have a windows box nearby ATM to try.

[17:52] <timotimo> me neither, sorry about that

[17:52] <ugexe> it cant all be about closing an issue over everything

[17:53] <Zoffix> ugexe: +1 on that

[17:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v domidumont

[17:53] <poohman> ok thanks - ill write an email

[17:53] <poohman> zoffix - will try to read up on prompt

[17:53] <timotimo> you can always just download any other intellij ide and use the comma plugin version

[17:54] <timotimo> as a temporary fallback

[17:54] <timotimo> but do write that mail anyway so that we can figure the rpoblem out and perhaps fix it for any future versions

[18:41] <lizmat> do we have a simple hyperop that creates a completely flat list ?

[18:42] <jmerelo> lizmat: something like [|]? Unless that's the thing, I don't think so

[18:46] <lizmat> I might, but I think I know the answer already :-(

[18:46] <lizmat> and actually: I phrased the question wrong: I'm looking at something I can use with Z

[18:47] <lizmat> m: dd (1,2,3) |Z (4,5,6)   # should create (1,4,2,5,3,6)

[18:56] <yoleaux> 25 Oct 2018 15:59Z <tyil> uzl: thanks, I fixed the "it's" to "its" in my local repo, I'll push it when I get home. On the .. vs ... operator, I am aware, but when I asked the question on SO I was advised to use .. and .reverse it

[18:58] <uzl> A kitchen isn't a clusterfuck of a kitchen just because it's well stacked with different ingredients. It solely means that there are lot of different ingredients to choose from.

[19:06] <uzl> .tell tyil ;)! What was the reason behind it? In one of his presentations, Damian was using (and sort of recommending?) the use of n...m instead of (m..n).reverse

[19:48] <thundergnat> lizmat; FWIW, I think we would be better served by just a postifix "flatten" operater that can then be applied to a list/sequence rather than a custom zip-and-flatten infix.

[20:00] <leont> On a big-endian architecture your first example would already give the wrong answer

[20:01] <leont> Line 20 crashes because it puts 64 bits of integer and 64 bits of pointers on the argument stack

[20:01] <leont> It then consumes 32 bits of integer, and interprets the next 64 bits as a pointer, which is actually the second 32 bits of the integer and the first 32 bits of the pointer

[20:14] <timotimo> it'd be lovely to hear what your stumbling blocks and questions on the way towards a working moarperf are

[20:15] <Skarsnik> maybe a dumb question, where is the doc for how to use it?

[20:15] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/moarperf - the readme is very short; if you can point out what exactly is missing i'll add that

[20:17] <timotimo> and i should really make release packages that you can use completely without npm

[20:17] <Skarsnik> Feels like I want to run it on my vps and upload the sql file to it or something ^^

[20:17] <Skarsnik> maybe do a docker image?

[20:17] <timotimo> you could, but i'm not sure i want to run this as a service on something

[20:17] <timotimo> yeah, i should do that

[20:18] <timotimo> there's a cro example docker file, that's probably a good starting point

[20:18] <timotimo> and then it can just include the npm stuff for installation and rm it again

[20:19] <Skarsnik> anyway. let's see if I can save time on these 450 ms of nativecast call on my 2.7 sec run x)

[20:19] <timotimo> that's an impressive amount in any case

[20:19] <Skarsnik> well 16xxx call to it

[20:21] <Skarsnik> let see if I can use the nqp call directly?

[20:22] <timotimo> oh, it's this specific version of nativecast?

[20:22] <Skarsnik> what confuse me. why it's the first multi that is called and not the last? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/lib/NativeCall.pm6#L661

[20:22] <timotimo> i assume the Native trait being applied does something... i wonder if the compler kicks in and tries to build code for it

[20:22] <Skarsnik> code is my $tab_child = nativecast(CArray[Pointer], $groot.v.element.children.data);

[20:23] <timotimo> oh, it's not the one for subs, then

[20:24] <Skarsnik> I had issue using TypedPointer directly. it was causing random segfault sadly (but it was 2-3 years ago)

[20:24] <Skarsnik> but .deref on TypedPointer is a nativecast call anyways

[20:29] <Skarsnik> https://github.com/Skarsnik/perl6-gumbo/blob/master/lib/Gumbo/Parser.pm6#L68 I could use one single nativecast to CArray[GumboNode] maybe xD

[20:35] <timotimo> oof :)

[20:35] <timotimo> but 5k is so much better than 16k

[20:35] <timotimo> did the time needed decrease about the same amount?

[20:36] *** cognominal-p6 left
[20:39] <Skarsnik> What annoy me in this test : Gumbo: 0.0292011 - XML: 2.52728475 . The C code (gumbo time) is doing most of the work (parsing a 250k html5 page with 10k elements) and it take Perl 6 100 time this time to just convert C object to xml object

[20:39] <timotimo> yeah, we should be able to figure this out somehow

[20:39] <Skarsnik> Ok Gumbo is super optimized

[20:39] <timotimo> the factor should be improvable, still

[20:40] <Skarsnik> I wonder if a way to prealloc the 10k xml object could improve this

[20:41] <timotimo> hm, these objects are gc-managed

[20:41] <timotimo> we don't really have something pre-alloc-y for that

[20:41] <timotimo> however

[20:41] <timotimo> you could create the objects lazily on first access

[20:42] <timotimo> like, create an array-like object that can create the objects the first time they are accessed

[20:42] <timotimo> that should also be better from a GC standpoint

[20:42] <timotimo> i.e. the object gets created just before it gets used the first time

[20:42] <Skarsnik> but... the method that create these object is only 634.49ms of the run

[20:42] <timotimo> oh

[20:42] <timotimo> exclusive vs inclusive?

[20:43] <Skarsnik> 650/110

[20:43] <timotimo> OK

[20:45] <Skarsnik> maybe I could send you a sql file?

[20:49] <timotimo> go ahead :)

[20:51] <Skarsnik> damn the sql profiler output is too fast!

[20:51] <Skarsnik> ok Perl 6 is only 10 time slower without the profiler xD

[20:53] <Skarsnik> hm that does not create me the sql file

[20:53] <Skarsnik> Ho, I need the profile switch too xD

[20:56] <Skarsnik> brb shower

[21:02] <timotimo> yeah, it should probably work with only --profile-filename and without --profile; we were going to change how --proflie-filename and --profile work together

[21:04] *** lizmat left
[21:15] <timotimo> ah, dang

[21:15] <timotimo> not the right version :D

[21:18] <Skarsnik> my rakudo is too old?

[21:18] <timotimo> no, my moarperf is too new

[21:19] <timotimo> i'm developing the frontend at the same time as i'm adding more stuff to the profiler

[21:19] <Skarsnik> random idea: give a fixed id so you can link the profile result to other people if it's running on a public webserver

[21:19] <timotimo> hah, identity shows up as #1 for exclusive time

[21:20] <timotimo> which is funny because it turns into "prof_enter", "set a, b", "prof_leave"

[21:20] <timotimo> the set should also be eliminated soon-ish

[21:20] <timotimo> and then the profiler should turn prof_enter, prof_leave with nothing in between into nothing at all

[21:21] <Skarsnik> I think the "current" profiler does not handle multi correctly x)

[21:21] *** jcallen_ is now known as jcallen

[21:22] <timotimo> that would surprise me

[21:22] <timotimo> how do you reach that conclusion?

[21:24] <Skarsnik> I added another multi for nativecast before the first one (same line) that take a Mu ::type as first parameter that call nqp::nativecall/stuff and still show this one as the one used.

[21:25] <timotimo> are you clicking on the links or comparing line numbers manually?

[21:25] <timotimo> have you verified that the one you're expecting is being called, like by putting a "say" in it?

[21:25] <Skarsnik> the current html one. you can't click on stuff. it only shot the path + line number

[21:25] <timotimo> ah, ok

[21:25] *** lizmat joined
[21:25] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lizmat

[21:26] <Skarsnik> and yes. it's not this one that is called ^^

[21:34] <squashable6> 🍕🍕🍕  First contribution by jnthn++! ♥

[21:36] <timotimo> i don't have anything clever yet for very recursive functions in the profiler

[21:36] <zostay> FYI https://docs.perl6.org/language/create-cli is missing on docs.perl6.org

[21:37] <timotimo> oh, how did that happen

[21:38] <timotimo> pod2onepage --html -v --source-path=./build --exclude=404.pod6 > html/perl6.html

[21:38] <timotimo> [...]

[21:38] <timotimo> processed ./build/Language/create-cli.pod6 

[21:38] <timotimo> Expected "=end pod" to terminate "=begin pod"; found "=end item" instead.

[21:38] <timotimo> at /home/doc.perl6.org/doc/./build/Language/modules.pod6:599

[21:38] <timotimo> ^- also worth looking at for sure

[21:39] <timotimo> wait, i think that log is way out of date

[21:39] <timotimo> is something broken with the way build logs are uploaded?

[21:42] *** census joined
[21:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v census

[21:42] <census> hello

[21:42] <census> why in this channel do we have + in front of our names but not some of the other channels?

[21:43] <timotimo> + means that a user has voice (commonly known as "has the +v status")

[21:43] <timotimo> we have an anti-spambot measure that gives people the right to speak only after a minute or so

[21:43] <timotimo> because there's been a wave of spam attacks lately

[21:43] <timotimo> this countermeasure has been very effective, at the cost of some user confusion

[21:44] <El_Che> more like the "power to be heard" and as it happens that is the academic definition of "voice" in academia :)

[21:44] <timotimo> ah, "the right to speak" isn't entirely correct, yes

[21:44] <timotimo> especially since mods with @ (aka +o) can still read what they send

[21:46] <census> okay thanks for explaining. some of the other channels don't seem to have this feature because i don't have a + there. what am i supposed to do?

[21:46] <timotimo> no need to do anything, unless that channel also has the channel mode +m set ("moderated")

[21:47] <census> i don't seem to be allowed to post. 

[21:47] <census> i'd like to post. not sure what i can do?

[21:47] <timotimo> what other channels are we talking about here; the other perl6 channels?

[21:47] <census> ##math for example

[21:47] <timotimo> aha

[21:48] <timotimo> i see the topic has an explanation

[21:48] <timotimo> they only allow registered users to speak, which on this network means you'll want to contact the bot called NickServ

[21:48] <timotimo> it's a regular user on IRC that you can talk to in a private chat

[21:48] <timotimo> just send "help", for example with /msg NickServ help

[21:49] <Skarsnik> Does the bugs on rt get copied to github?

[21:49] <timotimo> i believe in your irc client that ought to pop up a little tab on the top

[21:49] <timotimo> Skarsnik: no, we've decided to just not put new stuff on RT

[21:50] <census> thanks. i just typed that but i don't follow what to do from there exactly

[21:51] <timotimo> ah

[21:51] <timotimo> you'll register a nickname you like with nickserv, though it can of course be someone else already took "census"

[22:00] <Skarsnik> I remember looking at this bug and it was the parser not annoting properly the line number for the second statement

[22:00] <timotimo> i think we throw away line numbers for "internal" things

[22:00] <timotimo> like, only statements or maybe only things inside statementlists keep their line number info

[22:01] <timotimo> i think at least a part of that was Decided™

[22:01] <Skarsnik> it make me lost 2-3h while working on GPTrixie trying to fix the first line of a huge condition

[22:02] <Skarsnik> was not fun when each run took 30 sec

[22:03] <timotimo> oh no :(

[22:05] <Skarsnik> Kinda want to raise it to severe or something xD

[22:05] <Skarsnik> it's too misleading

[23:49] <timotimo> so that's a source of info missing from the profile
