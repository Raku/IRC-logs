[00:37] *** rindolf left
[00:42] *** comborico1611 left
[00:44] <timotimo> cheating at programming homework assignments should not be encouraged. in the real workplace, there's noone and especially no popular web site that can give you most of the answers you'll need

[00:52] <geekosaur> I would not expect a Python course to accept perl 6 answers

[00:58] *** fascinum joined
[01:01] <Juerd> geekosaur: Hey, I once wrote a 3-line PHP script that essentially started Perl 5 and fed it the rest of the file. Made my life a lot easier :)

[01:01] *** AlexDani` joined
[01:02] <Juerd> geekosaur: If it's executable Python code, that just happens to let Perl 6 do the heavy lifting, it's still a python program? :D

[01:02] <geekosaur> only if you can convince the teacher/prof of that

[01:02] <geekosaur> (then again I once handed a math prof who underspecified a Riemannian integration program written in RM/COBOL. I should talk)

[01:03] *** AlexDaniel left
[01:03] <timotimo> if you're using "print" to output some text, isn't it the rest of the whole operating system doing the actual heavy lifting? :P

[01:03] <geekosaur> (mind, I knew I could get away with it; we had a bit of a running joke going on all semester)

[01:04] <Juerd> timotimo: I use the same example when asking people why they think writing their own solution is better than reusing an existing one. They typically fail to see that most of what they're doing still does reuse existing code, but this argument often helps them understand that using libraries isn't bad at all :)

[01:05] <timotimo> pay the designers of the font in your terminal and code editor ffs :P

[01:06] <Juerd> I'm afraid that one day someone will take it the other way and go NIH all the way down to the hardware

[01:06] <timotimo> well, not everybody uses fonts to read text, of course

[01:07] <Juerd> Audio fonts, aka voices.

[01:08] <timotimo> well, there's also braille devices

[01:10] *** Xliff left
[01:11] *** Xliff joined
[01:12] <Juerd> I could see that as a font

[01:12] <Juerd> (no pun intended)

[01:13] <timotimo> fair enough. there's only really one braille font you can "choose" from, right?

[01:13] <Juerd> Well, it does come in several sizes, and weights

[01:13] *** cog_ joined
[01:13] <Juerd> And, er, thickness I guess?

[01:15] <timotimo> i do believe braille devices are usually very heavy ;)

[01:15] <timotimo> at least they're pretty big

[01:15] <timotimo> i'm told they use piezos for each individual nub and since piezos hardly move at all, they've got looooong levers in there

[01:18] *** athenot joined

[01:22] <timotimo> oh, ok

[01:23] <timotimo> i'm okay, not finding a good way out of a specific bug i'm seeing

[01:23] <timotimo> regarding the profiler

[01:24] <Herby_> but since I lack the chops, I'll provide moral support instead :)

[01:24] <Herby_> you can do it

[01:25] <timotimo> at this point i'm getting a whole lot of suggestions and examples of broken code that moral support feels more useful :)

[03:07] <Herby_> rookie question here: in the latest p6 weekly, there was a mention of a 6% speedup in certain areas.  If I wanted to see how those speedups were achieved, where do I look?

[03:07] <Herby_> I'm a github novice too

[03:11] <MasterDuke> Herby_: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commits/master

[03:14] <Herby_> MasterDuke: thanks

[03:22] *** AlexDani` is now known as AlexDaniel

[03:23] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: changes like this are usually also referred to in the changelog

[03:23] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: dumb question, but where can I see that?

[03:23] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/ChangeLog

[03:24] <Herby_> awesome, thanks

[03:24] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: changelog for this release is not there yet, but it will be this week

[03:25] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: I might get started on the monthly squashathon early. I think I might be able to resolve some of the LFH in whateverable

[03:25] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: oh! That's pretty cool

[03:25] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: let me know if you're able to run things locally, because I was planning to double check that things work before the squashathon

[03:26] *** w_richard_w left
[03:26] *** w_richard_w joined
[03:26] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: I do know that bisectable's tests fail because it is constantly attempting to download binaries that don't exist

[03:26] <AlexDaniel> but everything else works I think

[03:26] <Herby_> another beginner question that I was going to ask: with these being IRC bots, any guidance on how I go about testing changes?

[03:27] <Herby_> I'm not too familiar with irc bots in general

[03:27] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: oh, this should be documented

[03:27] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: in case of whateverable there are tests: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/tree/master/t

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: and if you simply run it like this: t/evalable.t

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> oops

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> perl6 t/evalable.t

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> it should work

[03:28] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: it will actually spawn a mini irc server, and the bot will connect to it

[03:28] <Herby_> ok. so I should be able to clone the whateverable github repo to my local computer, make changes, then run the test

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> yes, and add your tests for the newly added feature (or tweak tests if you're changing existing functionality)

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: second option is this: sake debug:evalable

[03:29] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: it will actually start the bot, and it will connect to freenode and join #whateverable channel

[03:30] <Herby_> great. i'll give it a go and hopefully can solve some of the low low lhf

[03:30] <Herby_> do I need to be on a specific release to do the changes and testing? right now I'm on the latest release on rakudo-pkg

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> any recent-ish rakudo will do

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: there was this page: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Adding-New-Features

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: but it is really out of date, feel free to change it

[03:31] <AlexDaniel> “It is really hard to work on these bots if you do not have a couple of thousands of rakudo builds” – totally not true anymore

[03:32] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: what's your OS by the way?

[03:32] <Herby_> My main is Windows 10 but I have a virtualbox with ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04

[03:32] <Herby_> but i'm a linux rookie

[03:32] <Herby_> so still figuring things out there

[03:34] <AlexDaniel> most bots will work much better on linux 64-bit

[03:35] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: fwiw what happens there is that bisectable needs a bunch of rakudo versions to work properly, and there are thousands of these on whateverable server

[03:35] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: one option is to build these yourself, which will take a lot of time of course

[03:35] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: but by default if you're on linux amd64 it'll pull existing builds from whateverable server

[03:35] <AlexDaniel> so you don't need to build anything

[03:36] <AlexDaniel> and 15k builds are ready for use :)

[03:37] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: and actually most bots will need to run rakudo in one way or another, not just bisectable

[03:38] <Herby_> Ok.  I'll start trying my luck with some of the simple issues and see what I can get done.  I'll probably be asking lots of questions :)

[03:38] <Herby_> thanks for the guidance

[03:39] *** khw left
[03:40] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: there's a high chance that you'll stumble upon issues that are my fault, so feel free to complain :)

[03:41] <Herby_> there will be no complaints. you do great work for p6 :)

[03:41] <AlexDaniel> I still expect bug reports though, no matter how good our work is :)

[07:54] <donpdonp> has Buf $!hash; :)

[07:55] <jmerelo> donpdonp: :hash is equivalent to hash => True. That's why it says stuff about Bool...

[07:56] <jmerelo> That's the correct syntax, I guess. It's equivalent to hash => $hash

[15:09] <lucasb> the other way around :)

[15:09] <lucasb> why <1.2> isn't a Rat/

[15:09] <lucasb> ?

[15:10] <lizmat> m: dd <42>.^name

[15:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb86392c9: OUTPUT: «"IntStr"␤»

[15:10] <lizmat> same reason ^^^

[15:10] <lizmat> lucasb: the xxxStr types are the dualvar types of Perl 6

[15:10] <lucasb> hm, ok. Int and Num's are different than Rat and Complex then

[15:11] <lucasb> with regard allomorphism

[15:11] <lizmat> not sure I follow

[15:11] <lizmat> no, they should be the same ?

[15:11] <timotimo> <x/y> is syntax for a numerator/denominator literal

[15:11] <Tison> m: say (+<1.2>).^name

[15:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb86392c9: OUTPUT: «Rat␤»

[15:11] <lizmat> m: say (~<1.2>).^name

[15:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb86392c9: OUTPUT: «Str␤»

[15:11] <Tison> If you know <...> provides a list of stringy

[15:12] <lucasb> yes, understood. <1/2> and <1+1i> and not quoted lists, but literals.

[15:12] <lucasb> *are not

[15:13] <lucasb> ok, next question :)

[15:13] <lucasb> <0+0i> is Complex, but <0i> is ComplexStr

[15:13] <lucasb> can't <0i> be a literal for a complex number?

[15:14] <lucasb> also, <0+i> is a Str. Can't it be a complex literal?

[15:14] <Tison> m: say <1+1i>.^name

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb86392c9: OUTPUT: «Complex␤»

[16:02] <Zoffix> lucasb: because there's no point in writing 1.2 with brakets. Without brakets it's still a Rat literal, so the obvious implication is you wanted a RatStr. `1/2` on the other hand is not a literal. It's an expression and you can't use it to mean a Rat literal in certain places that don't accept expressions (like signature literals). So <1/2> is the syntax for literals and if you actually want a RatStr, use

[16:02] <Zoffix> space.

[16:03] *** |oLa| joined
[16:03] <Zoffix> lucasb: same applies to complex, as `1+i` is an expression. And it's a bug that <1+i> is a plain Str.

[16:04] <lucasb> Zoffix: do you have any opinion on <1i> to mean a complex literal?

[16:05] <Zoffix> lucasb: and this stuff is documented here: https://docs.perl6.org/language/glossary#index-entry-Allomorph and on the upcoming Numerics language page: https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/car-grant-midrat/doc/Language/numerics.pod6#L382-L394

[16:05] <lucasb> makes sense now, thanks Zoffix & others for clarification

[16:05] *** robertle left
[16:05] <Zoffix> lucasb: yeah, it probably should be a complex literal, since `i` is a postfix operator, so it's an expression

[16:05] <Zoffix> m: -> 1i {say "in"}(1i)

[16:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb86392c9: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3-> 17⏏5i {say "in"}(1i)␤    expecting any of:␤        whitespace␤»

[16:06] <Zoffix> huh

[16:07] <Zoffix> Ah, right. If it were a complex literal it'd get accepted.

[16:07] <Zoffix> Kinda makes me think we should accept allmorphic numeric literals too

[16:12] <synopsebot> R#1827 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1827 <1i> should be a Complex literal, not ComplexStr

[16:26] <uzl> Other than calling a method on an invocant, can the term 'self' access an attribute?

[16:26] <uzl> I wonder if the reason this example (https://pastebin.com/Nq6xd3wx) is not working is 

[16:27] <uzl> because I'm trying to call a method on the invocant and using the wrong syntax.

[16:29] <timotimo> ah, self!foo is syntax only for method calls

[16:29] <timotimo> you really need $!color there

[16:29] <timotimo> uzl: ^

[16:30] <[Coke]> Zoffix: irc is not the best way to reach me for TPF related issues. Email is best. You don't have a GM yet, I'm working on it. Worst case, it'll be me again.

[16:36] <timotimo> yup

[16:37] <timotimo> sorry, i didn't look closely enough

[16:53] <uzl_> And self.color = %hue; means I'm calling the method on the invocant?

[16:53] <Zoffix> uzl_: yes

[16:53] <uzl_> Thank you!

[16:54] *** Zoffix left
[16:54] <uzl_> Probably not related, but how do you tag a particular user like you did with username?

[16:55] <timotimo> you mean on irc? literally just put their nickname somewhere in the line; usually irc clients will tab-complete nicknames for you

[16:59] <[Coke]> zoffix: the secretary address is fine, but so is coke at cpan.org or will at coleda.com

[17:00] <uzl_> timotimo, For some Hexchat doesn't add the colon but a comma after the username.

[17:00] <[Coke]> Zoffix: for the website, feel free to send me a list of defects, I'll see if I can find someone who can fix them or provide access.

[17:01] <timotimo> that's not important :)

[17:02] <uzl_> oh, great! Thanks!

[17:02] <geekosaur> hexchat is configurable

[17:03] <geekosaur> preferences > interface > input box > nick completion > nick completion suffix

[17:07] <uzl_> geekosaur: Just did that!

[17:08] <El_Che> hexchat, is that the successor of xchat?

[17:09] <timotimo> i think it's just "windows builds of xchat"?

[17:09] <geekosaur> it's successor

[17:09] <geekosaur> xchat still exists after a fashion but seems to be pretty much dead

[17:09] <geekosaur> hexchat cam einto existence when the xchat devs went commercial for windows

[17:10] <El_Che> I run xchat in the day, bit it didn't offer much to get me off irssi

[17:10] <El_Che> ran

[17:10] <El_Che> it felt more like a mirc->linux-alternative transition

[17:11] <geekosaur> yes and no. it's somewhere between the two; I find mirc highly annoying

[17:11] <geekosaur> but most of that is how they use screen real estate

[17:11] <timotimo> when i was little, mirc was a lot of fun

[17:11] <El_Che> yeah, it was my first irc client tough :)

[17:11] <timotimo> what with the custom scripts that could drastically change the interface

[17:12] <geekosaur> xchat/hexchat style works better for large screens. mirc always feels to me like multiple tui windows

[17:12] <El_Che> mirc -> epic II -> epic II with bitchX -> irssi

[17:12] <El_Che> last time I saw mirc it still felt likt a windows 3.11 app

[17:12] <geekosaur> which can work but is little better than irssi with cheap sprinkles

[17:12] <[Coke]> Zoffix: upcoming site migration to a new system. Probably wait until that drops.

[17:16] *** uzl joined
[17:16] <geekosaur> of course a lot of this is personal preference. I find that a mix of GUI and TUI works well, and hexchat does a decent job of giving me that mix

[17:17] <El_Che> you need a bouncer or something similar though

[18:34] <geekosaur> class Perl6 does Whatever {...}

[18:36] <timotimo> "does whatever" lets a class just typecheck "true" for any type or role or subset

[18:36] <moritz> why does this discussion remind me of "compatible with Windows NT 4.0 or better" statements? :-)

[18:38] <Herby_> question: is there an easy way to see what p6 dependencies a repo has?

[18:38] <geekosaur> ideally it has a meta file with that information

[18:38] <Herby_> ahhhh. found it. thanks!

[21:04] *** molaf left
[21:05] <El_Che> (depending on how experienced you are with Linux) docker is a lightweight alternative for virtualbox

[21:05] <El_Che> with 'docker commit $id' you can save your progress

[21:05] <geekosaur> there I'd want to make sure it's not using a port that is quietly being used by vbox for something else (like, say, host to guest communication)

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I think Windows is the main OS in that case, so docker probably not an option

[21:06] <geekosaur> although it can also mean you found yet another bug in vbox >.>

[21:06] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: docker works well on recent Windows

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> oh?

[21:06] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it uses a lightweight hypervisor

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> how in the world…

[21:06] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: like it does on mac

[21:06] <Herby_> El_Che: i have very little in the way of Linux chops. I installed VB in an attempt to learn a little linux

[21:07] <geekosaur> docker has been both a hypervisor manager and an interface to cgroups for quite some time now

[21:07] <El_Che> Herby_: in that's case it's a good choice

[21:07] <geekosaur> it transpaently uses cgroups where they;re available and sufficient, and a hypervisor when they;re not

[21:07] <AlexDaniel> well, wow

[21:07] <AlexDaniel> that's awesome
