[07:29] <AlexDaniel> that does work :)

[07:30] <jmerelo> Basically: 1. work against issues, 2. always assign issues 3. leave "first good issues" for the last day

[07:30] <AlexDaniel> I wonder if it'll announce assign event twice (once by Geth and once by squashable6)

[07:31] *** mcmillhj joined
[07:32] <jmerelo> I have also created this milestone for today https://github.com/perl6/doc/milestone/1

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: can we tweak 3 to say ‚ÄúStart by resolving one of the ‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù, if there are any. Leave other ones till the end of the day (so that others can start with something easy too)

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äù

[07:33] <jmerelo> Basically to group the issues we'll be working on. Please add issues you'll be working with there; I'll do it when one is assigned and reflected there.

[07:34] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Um, don't know. Maybe I should qualify by saying "If you have already contributed, please leave this for newcomers"

[07:34] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: in fact, it would be better for frequent contributors like you and me to tackle those issues that would take a couple of days. Together, if possible.

[07:35] <jmerelo> We can always get to the good first issues after the hackathon.

[07:35] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I'm thinking of turning into a call to action instead of a restriction thingy we have now

[07:35] *** mcmillhj left
[07:35] <AlexDaniel> it*

[07:36] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: yep, that's right. 

[07:36] <AlexDaniel> so basically like ‚Äú1. rule 2. rule 3. Go resolve an issue!

[07:36] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äù

[07:36] <jmerelo> OK, I'll put your phrase in

[07:37] *** pmurias joined
[07:38] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I think it's also important not to over-organize. Usually we have a few new contributors but not too many to create any problem :)

[07:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: of course, that's why there are few rules and mainly to avoid conflicts (and subsequent frustration). 

[07:41] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I can take care of the milestone, no problem. So far the only way of knowing what's going on is the bot, but having a milestone there and see how we advance towards it gives a sense of accomplishment that can be good for newcomers.

[07:42] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I'm not going to enforce the rules, either. But it's just common sense to assign issues, for instance. There's no problem in the regular regime, when it's highly unlikely that two persons are working on the same.

[07:43] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: but during a hackathon, it can easily happen and it's the best if we can avoid that.

[12:09] <lizmat> bringing __FILE__, __LINE__, __PACKAGE__ and __SUB__ to the Perl 6 world

[12:10] <lizmat> (which of course already existed as $?FILE, $?LINE, $?PACKAGE and &?ROUTINE)

[12:11] <xq> __DIR__ is also very useful

[12:11] <xq>  ( https://metacpan.org/pod/Dir::Self )

[12:12] <lizmat> No documentation for perl function '__DIR__' found

[12:12] <xq> yeah it's not in core

[12:12] <lizmat> ok, *phew*  :-)

[12:14] *** Guest43854 joined
[12:15] <El_Che> lizmat: I used to like you. Why do you bring python into my perl6?

[12:15] <El_Che> ;)

[12:15] <lizmat> python?  that's Perl 5

[12:15] <El_Che> lizmat: __init__

[12:15] <lizmat> that's not Perl 5  :-)

[12:16] <lizmat> init?

[12:16] <lizmat> *innit rather  :-)

[12:17] <El_Che> def __init__(self): ...

[12:17] <El_Che> it hurts my eyes :)

[12:17] *** cog_ left
[12:18] <lizmat> sorry  :-)

[12:20] <sjn> lizmat: any support for <DATA> yet?

[12:21] <sjn> (and __DATA__ and __END__)

[12:21] <lizmat> that will be *much* trickier  :-(

[12:21] <sjn> aw

[12:22] <lizmat> well, creating a DATA handle that would return a handle that starts reading at where the __DATA__ or __END__ is in the code, would be not so hard

[12:22] * sjn wouldn't mind porting his .signature file to Perl 6

[12:22] <lizmat> having compilation stop whenever a __DATA__ or __END__ is encountered, is a bit more tricky

[12:23] <lizmat> unless someone has suggestions for that 

[12:24] <sjn> lizmat: not to mention seek(DATA,0,0) # read the source code of yourself

[12:24] <lizmat> that would just fall out of reading the source file until __DATA__

[12:25] <lizmat> so not an issue... the issue is to have compilation ignore everything after __DATA__ or __END__

[12:25] <El_Che> lizmat: it would open doors for things like fatpack and the like

[12:26] <El_Che> lizmat: or even stuck C libs in there

[12:26] <El_Che> 1ste likely, 2nd not really probably

[12:27] <lizmat> unless someone has an idea to have compilation stop at the encounter of a __DATA__ / __END__ as a slang

[12:27] <lizmat> I'm stuck  :-)

[12:27] <sjn> is this something that should happen at moarvm level

[12:27] <sjn> ?

[12:28] <jnthn> No.

[12:28] <jnthn> This functionality already exists in Perl 6 as =finish, no?

[12:28] <El_Che> that categorical :)

[12:28] <lizmat> jnthn: yes

[12:28] * El_Che imagines jnthn smashing the table :)

[12:28] <lizmat> but so far my forays into slang land have been less than successful  :-(

[12:30] <jnthn> El_Che: Well, given MoarVM doesn't know anything much about parsing, it's fairly easy to answer ;)

[12:31] <jnthn> lizmat: In theory, the grammar could just override https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp#L1019 and copy what's there and add __DATA__ or some such

[12:31] <jnthn> lizmat: And the action method shouldn't need any changes

[12:31] <jnthn> So it's probably an easy slang :)

[12:32] <lizmat> ok, I'll have a go at it

[12:32] <jnthn> Which I'll resist writing instead of doing my actual $dayjob work... :P

[12:32] <lizmat> jnthn: :-)

[13:07] <jkramer> m: class Foo { has $.x; has $.y; }; my %h = <x y> Z=> (5, 10); Foo.new(|%h).note

[13:07] <jkramer> And this doesn't:

[13:10] <jkramer> They're both slips of pairs but one gets accepted and the other doesn't

[13:12] <jnthn> Precedence. 

[13:12] <jnthn> Oh, also, perhaps, not realizing that | means something different in an argument list than it does outside of one

[13:13] * jnthn did suggest two different operators for that, but TimToady disagreed :)

[13:13] <jnthn> m: class Foo { has $.x; has $.y; }; Foo.new(|%(<x y> Z=> (5, 10))).note

[13:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1447f41e6: OUTPUT: ¬´Foo.new(x => 5, y => 10)‚ê§¬ª

[13:14] <jkramer> Well ok I'll go with that then, thanks jnthn :)

[13:14] <jnthn> Argument flattening is entirely syntactic

[13:15] <jnthn> There has to be a | on the argument that is being flattened

[13:15] <jnthn> It just being a slip or a Capture won't be enough

[14:22] <ryn1x_> Is it expected for a script that runs fine to fail when using "use trace"? If this sounds like a possible bug I can post a question with my minimum test case on stackoverflow. It happens with a function I use that returns a map with object values.

[14:33] <moritz> ryn1x_: I'd say it's simply a bug in rakudo

[14:34] <moritz> $test comes out as Block with 'use trace;' in effect

[14:35] <moritz> so 'use trace;' likely confuses the block-vs-hash heuristic in the compiler

[19:39] <mcmillhj> What would be the correct return signature for a function that doesn't return a value? 

[19:41] *** st_elmo left
[19:41] <lizmat> mcmillhj: in Perl 6, *something* is *always* returned

[19:41] <lizmat> the closest thing to "void" is returning Nil

[19:42] <lizmat> m: sub foo(--> Nil) {  ... }

[19:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1447f41e6: ( no output )

[19:42] <ryn1x> was the binary 'perl6-debug' changed to 'perl6-debug-m' at some point? or is the binary installed by rakudo star named differently depending ones os?

[19:43] <lizmat> if called in a sink context, that should give the optimizer hints to completely ignore the return value

[19:43] <mcmillhj> lizmat++ thanks 

[19:46] <mcmillhj> lizmat++ thanks 

[19:46] <lizmat> you're welcome

[19:46] <lizmat> :-)

[19:46] <mcmillhj> oops :) didn't mean to paste that again 

[19:48] *** windyhouse left
[19:52] <El_Che> an explicit --> Nil signature does not makes sense though

[19:54] <lizmat> El_Che: why ?

[19:54] <El_Che> indeed, why

[19:54] <lizmat> Nil indicates the absence of a value where there should have been one

[19:55] <El_Che> if no return is given, it's a function that isn't expected to return something useful

[19:55] <El_Che> if you're expecting something, you can always return Nil

[19:55] *** windyhouse joined
[19:56] <[Coke]> m: sub a(--> Nil) {return 42}; say a

[19:56] <lizmat> El_Che: but that's the whole point of specifying it in the signature, so you don't have the last value leaking out

[19:56] <lizmat> without having to make sure it is Nil or doing a `return Nil`

[19:57] <El_Che> yeah, that's true

[19:57] <El_Che> but ugly

[19:57] <lizmat> .oO( so much better than butt ugly )

[19:57] *** TEttinger joined
[19:57] <El_Che> on the other hand

[19:58] <El_Che> if you aren't expecting a value from a sub/method, you're probably not assinging them to somewhere

[19:58] <El_Che> something like that could be catched by the compiler instead of needing syntax

[19:59] <lizmat> well, that's basically what the 

[19:59] <lizmat> warnings was of [Coke] last code

[20:01] <El_Che> but it needed the -->Nil

[20:01] <El_Che> I am saying if there is no return in the signature, it could catch it as well

[20:01] <El_Che> an implicit return value

[20:02] <El_Che> on the other hand, "sub foo() { say "foo" }" would probably die then

[20:02] <El_Che> mmm

[20:05] <lizmat> absence of a return signature is --> Any

[20:05] *** athenot left
[20:06] <El_Che> yeah, it makes sense

[20:06] <lizmat> El_Che: remember that we also have typechecks on return values

[20:06] <mcmillhj> ^ I'm confused by this , I get a missing block error .. but there is definitely a block there

[20:07] <El_Che> mcmillhj: ->

[20:07] <El_Che> typo

[20:07] <El_Che> -> is for loops, --> for returns

[20:08] <moritz> mcmillhj: -> introduces a signature

[20:08] <lizmat> El_Che++ # beat me  :-)

[20:08] <mcmillhj> gah 

[20:08] <mcmillhj> thank you 

[20:08] <moritz> so it wants a block after the signature

[20:08] <mcmillhj> I have font ligatures turned on, so it was difficult to see in my editor.

[20:27] <mcmillhj> if I have a definition like this in a class `has Stack $!in;` do I need to call the .new() method on this attribute? Or is this taken care of for me?

[20:28] <El_Che> mcmillhj: new is for creating an instance of the class

[20:29] <El_Che> $!in mean the attribute doesn't get a getter automatically

[20:29] <timotimo> if you don't put anything in there manually, you'll end up with just the Stack type object

[20:29] <mcmillhj> right, I am mainly ask where should that initialization occur? does that go in new? Or build?

[20:29] <timotimo> i.e. an undefined object

[20:30] <El_Che> in contrast to $.in (getter as .in) and $.in is rw (also a setter)

[20:30] <El_Che> mcmillhj: on simple code the automatic new is all you need

[20:31] *** ryn1x left
[20:31] <El_Che> my $instance = class.new(in => "yes!!");

[20:31] <timotimo> you can set a default value right then and there, though

[20:31] <mcmillhj> $!in is not an attribute that I would expose 

[20:31] <timotimo> has Stack $.in .= new, that works, right?

[20:32] <timotimo> m: class Stack { }; class Other { has Stack $.in .= new;  }; Other.new.perl.say

[20:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1447f41e6: OUTPUT: ¬´Other.new(in => Stack.new)‚ê§¬ª

[20:32] <mcmillhj> timotimo: yes, thank you. That is exactly what I was asking 

[20:32] <mcmillhj> timotimo: I didn't know if the initialization could occur when I declared the attribute or had to happen in another function 

[20:33] <timotimo> the code on the RHS of the = gets treated as a piece of code to be run when a default value needs to be generated

[23:13] <todd> any windows programmers here?

[23:16] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:17] <todd> I ask because I created a perl6 program for a customer and created a desktop icon (shortcut) for him to start it.  Problem: Windows 7 won't let me pin the shortcut to the task bar, as perl6 is a .bat file.  All of Google's suggestions do not work.    What did you do to work around the problem?

[23:20] <Petit_Dejeuner> I guess you make a wrapper that just calls system.

[23:20] *** mcmillhj left
[23:20] <timotimo> does anybody know how appveyor artifacts work?

[23:21] *** Guest43854 left
[23:21] *** windyhouse left
[23:22] <todd> tried `cmd.exe /C perl6 xxx.pl6` and that did not work.  

[23:22] <todd> I tried running what the batch file ran and that did not work either: C:\rakudo\bin\moar.exe --execname="%~dpf0" --libpath="C:\rakudo\share\nqp\lib" --libpath="C:\rakudo\share\perl6\lib" --libpath="C:\rakudo\share\perl6\runtime" C:\rakudo\share\perl6\runtime\perl6.moarvm C:\NtUtil\RemoveMargin.pl6"

[23:23] <jnthn> If the application is installed using `zef` or similar than that generates a batch file that launches the script

[23:23] *** ktown joined
[23:25] <jnthn> https://github.com/jnthn/p6-app-installermaker-wix may also be of interest

[23:25] <todd> I installed perl6 with the msi from perl6.org

[23:26] <todd> This is a Windows 7 issue for sure, I just worndered if you guys ever tripped across it and what did you do?

[23:32] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:33] <jnthn> todd: Hm, just played with it and got it to work

[23:34] <jnthn> It doesn't directly work to pin it, but if after pinning it, then right click on the pinned icon, right click on the top entry, pick properties. The I put in there: %comspec% /k "C:\consulting\MoarVM\install\bin\perl6.bat c:\foo\foo.p6"

[23:35] <todd> It pinned to the task bar???  What version of Winows are you using?

[23:35] <jnthn> Replace that with your Rakudo path and script path, of course, those are just my local ones :)

[23:35] <jnthn> This is in Win 7

[23:40] <timotimo> todd: https://imgur.com/poOh7mY - no promises, but maybe i can give you a bit of happyness today

[23:40] <todd> that worked!  Thank you.  now how to tell comspec to exit the cmd windows after it finishes.

[23:43] <El_Che> irc, the only place where windows is an esoteric OS for weird people :)

[23:44] <todd> timo: I don't get it.  Sorry.  That look like Windows I-Can't-Count.  If you were trying to scare me, it worked!  :-)

[23:44] <El_Che> "install\bin" <-- I wondered where the weird defaults in ./Configure.pl came from :)

[23:44] <todd> changed the /k to /c and the window exited.  Thank you!

[23:45] <timotimo> todd: i figured out that appveyor lets me RDP into a running session, and i'm compiling rakudo at the moment

[23:45] <timotimo> this is a windows server 2012 r2

[23:45] <timotimo> ... why is it a 64bit one, i thought i set it to 32bit? 

[23:46] <jnthn> todd: Add && exit

[23:46] <El_Che> timotimo: do you mind taking some notes? I have that in my todo as well. Adding windows to rakudo-pkg-canary to test rakudo prereleases

[23:46] <jnthn> todd: e.g. like %comspec% /k "C:\consulting\MoarVM\install\bin\perl6.bat c:\foo\foo.p6 && exit"

[23:46] <timotimo> how do i find out if a given .exe is a 32bit or 64bit program?

[23:47] <El_Che> timotimo: run it and look it in the task manager?

[23:47] <El_Che> 32 bit should be marked

[23:47] <timotimo> ah

[23:48] <El_Che> there is probably a ways without running it, though

[23:57] <jnthn> Though as with many things, if it blocks me at some point with something I'm working on, I'd probably try and do it. :-)
