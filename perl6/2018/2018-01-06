[06:17] <araraloren> :) Don't know what happened

[06:19] <geekosaur> it's trying to load a module. my guess is that you have modules from a different build that you copied from another machine, and they need to actually be reinstalled rather than simply copied over

[06:21] <Todd> ~.perl6 got copied over from the old machine.  Delete it?

[06:21] <geekosaur> (precomp, among other things, stores actual byte offsets to internals and system-installed modules; if those offsets have changed, the precompiled modules will fail to load, the error could be better, though)

[06:21] <geekosaur> move it aside, at least; ytou may need to see what modules you need to reinstall'

[06:21] <araraloren> ...

[07:56] <todd> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1531855

[07:59] <todd> <editorial comment> why Fedora packages rakudo and zef separately is beyond me.   rakudo-pkg-Fedora27 included zef in its rpm, so should Fedora.  It would get rid of old zef's being mixed with new. </editorial comment>

[08:02] <todd> Oh Red hat is so going to "WON'T FIX" this one:

[08:02] <todd> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1531856

[08:03] <todd>  Please package zef with rakudo 

[08:03] *** rindolf joined
[08:03] <Zoffix> todd: kinda confusing reports. zef doesn't come with rakudo. It comes with rakudo star

[08:04] <todd> Thank you all for the help in chasing this down.    The hint was revision conflict.  Fedora's Rakudo is just broken.

[08:04] <todd> take a peek inside 

[08:04] <todd> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/download/v2017.11/rakudo-pkg-Fedora27-2017.11-01.x86_64.rpm

[08:04] <todd> it comes with it

[08:05] <Zoffix> todd: those RPMs are made by a 3rd party volunteer.

[08:05] <todd> That must explain why they work and the official release does not.  :'(

[08:05] <Zoffix> todd: these are basically the only deliverables made by the core team: https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/  most users should use Rakudo Star

[08:07] <Zoffix> ===SORRY!===

[08:07] <Zoffix>     This type cannot unbox to a native string: P6opaque, Failure

[08:07] <todd> wonder why fedora is using plain rakudo.  I was following suite

[08:07] <Zoffix> todd: ^ and that could be a rakudo bug even. Are you still able to reproduce that? Can you run with perl6 --ll-exception flag?

[08:08] <todd> Can't reproduce it anymore.  It is fixed.  Do you still have that vpaste I make.  I lost it.  It would be good to add to the bug report.

[08:08] <Zoffix> todd: it might be using plain rakudo because there *are* monthly release of the compiler-only (and the confusion being witnessed right now is why we don't publicize those too much). Rakudo Star releases, by comparion, are done once every three months

[08:09] <Zoffix> This one I'm guessing: http://vpaste.net/WuHL1

[08:10] <Zoffix> Yeah... I'm not familiar with the part of the codebase it's referencing...

[08:10] <todd> That's the one.  Thak you

[08:11] <todd> I just did a `dnf whatprovides rakudo-star' and got back "rakudo-star = 0.0.2017.06-1.fc2"   Wow.  they are using Fedora 26's spin in 27 and it is way out of date.

[08:11] <Zoffix> huggable: star

[08:11] <huggable> Zoffix, Estimated Rakudo Star releases for 2017: .01, .04, .07 & .10

[08:12] <Zoffix> todd: hm, weird version number too. There ain't not 2017.06 rakudo star

[08:12] <Zoffix> These are all we got: https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/star/

[08:12] <Zoffix> Wonder if they're too confusing our compiler releases for rakudo star releases

[08:17] <todd> Me thinks...  What??  I can think! I just can't spell...  Me thinks I will stick with https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases for now.  There is something that doesn't smell right over at Fedora

[08:18] <Zoffix> cool

[08:20] <todd> Fedora has this is their 27 repo too: rakudo-star = 0.0.2017.08-1.fc26   But as you said only .01, .04, .07 & .10.  Something is seriously off.

[08:23] <todd> Oh you know what.   I goofed.  I have an ssh terminal open on Fedora 26 machine doign some upgrades.  I did the whatprovides on it, whicfh explains the fc26.  I redid in on a FC27 machine and rakudo-star is not even support on 27.

[08:23] <Zoffix> :)

[08:24] <todd> I absolute adore Perl 6 (I come from Perl5 and years ago Modula 2, what a culture shift!).  I wish Fedora would get on board asap.  But I do have somewhre else to go, so I shouldn't complain and just be grateful

[08:26] <todd> I started with P5 to replace all the stuff I did in bash and then got into p5 big time.  P6 is a real nice clean up, especially the subroutines.  I program in Top Down and I live and die in subs.  The P5 guys must have just been tired when they put the subs together.

[08:34] <todd> Just stumbled across another weird one.

[08:34] <todd> ===SORRY!=== Failed to create directory '/home/linuxutil/.precomp/6A0100E73A9E0630ECFBF4CBF870A4533AB71A3F.1511306550.98398/96' with mode '0o777': Failed to mkdir: 13

[08:35] <todd> I am not making any directories!

[08:35] <todd> Line 13 is commented out!

[08:36] <moritz> it looks like 13 is the error code, not the line number

[08:36] <todd> mv .precomp .precomp.000

[08:36] <Zoffix> That's not line 13. It's errno. Permission denied

[08:36] <todd> fixed it.  Hold over from my old machine

[08:36] <moritz> btw there is a nice trick in Perl 5 for converting error numbers to error messages

[08:37] <moritz> $ perl -wE '$! = 13; say $!'

[08:37] * Zoffix just runs `errno 13` :)

[08:38] <todd> I think this is one of those M$ error where it ways one thing and means something else.

[08:39] <El_Che> todd: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg <-- up to date pkgs

[08:39] <todd> Boy I am really tripping across stuff today.  I really, really appreciate you guys help!

[08:40] <todd> That is where I way, just one directory deeper.  It would be nice if they had a repo.

[08:43] <Zoffix> .ask jnthn pondering R#1368 and looking at `callstatic` and `chain` ops in src/vm/moar/QAST/QASTOperationsMAST.nqp. Seems like we can have `chainstatic` op and gain some perf in chains with static ops, no? Does that sound sane?

[08:43] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[08:43] <synopsebot> R#1368 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1368 "42 < $a < 666" should be faster than "42 < $a && $a < 666", but is 2x as slow

[08:43] * Zoffix drops to bed

[08:44] <Zoffix> .tell jnthn FWIW, I realize the exact code in R#1368 could be constant-folded, I'm thinking of wider options

[08:44] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[08:47] <El_Che> todd: I plan to add repo's later, but because the pkgs have no dependencies it's not urgent ;)

[11:20] <DrForr> Probably just a namespace issue.

[11:20] <araraloren_> I do test like that

[11:20] <DrForr> Well, there you go.

[11:20] <araraloren_> but can not do that in the real module

[11:24] <DrForr> So what are you doing in the "real module" that makes that not work?

[11:32] <araraloren_> just make a wrap for MAIN function

[11:32] <araraloren_> DrForr, really simple

[11:32] <araraloren_> I try declare MAIN with `our`, not work too

[11:34] <DrForr> Could you put what you have in a gist so I can see it?

[11:34] *** geospeck left
[11:35] <araraloren_> Hmm, ok

[11:36] <DrForr> I'm doing this because what you say is "Just make a wrap" has a bunch of possible interpretations, and it's easier for me to see the code than play the guessing game of "Did they mean this..."

[11:37] *** |oLa| joined
[11:37] <araraloren_> Hmm, I not a newbie :)

[11:38] <araraloren_> In the module file, just `say &MAIN;` not working, and `say &::("GLOBAL::MAIN");` not working too

[11:39] <DrForr> I know that, and I don't mean to sound insulting. It's just that the language lends itself to many ways of achieving a task, and I don't want to run through the list of what I know works only to find out what you mean is something completely different.

[11:39] <araraloren_> DrForr, I want access the MAIN sub , and make a wrapper for it, so I can run my code before MAIN, and do somethign with the MAIN signature

[11:39] <DrForr> Again, can you please put actual code up, so I don't hae to guess what your module looks like?

[11:46] <DrForr> Well, it's a fragment, but I'll try to interpolate what I can, one mo.

[11:47] <araraloren_> okay, dinner time :P

[11:47] <DrForr> I also note that your module has a ::MAIN of its own, this may cause a... sigh.

[11:48] <DrForr> Also do you mean module or class?

[11:49] <araraloren_> module class ?

[11:50] <DrForr> Perl 6 has both modules and classes, and since your code fragment doesn't tell me what this is in, I can't tell what you mean.

[11:50] <araraloren_> Hmm, how about without that ?

[11:50] <araraloren_> not a module or class

[11:51] <DrForr> In fact I can't tell if this is a BEGIN block, a subroutine, a module or even a new() method.

[11:51] <araraloren_> just in that file

[13:49] <synopsebot> R#1368 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1368 "42 < $a < 666" should be faster than "42 < $a && $a < 666", but is 2x as slow

[15:45] <comborico1611> What do y'all think of a feature to toggle from concise error messaging to verbose error messaging?

[15:46] <moritz> in which context?

[15:48] <comborico1611> For example, some people prefer a concise error message, while others prefer more detail.  So for Rakudo Star, there could be some command to toggle to your preference.

[15:54] <moritz> that's why our error messages tend to deliver the most relevant information in the first line, and you can ignore the rest if that's enough

[15:54] <moritz> so, I think it's not worth the effort

[15:55] <comborico1611> I see.  I won't be able to judge that until I have many hours of experience with P6.

[15:55] <comborico1611> But that makes sense.

[15:56] <comborico1611> Moritz, how difficult do you think it would be for P6 to assume the role of PHP in Web Development?

[15:57] <comborico1611> By "assume the role" I don't mean to compete against it or take-over it's place.  I just mean, if I am a freelance web developer, would it be difficult to integrate P6 with Apache and MySQL?

[15:58] <moritz> not really; MySQL support is already there, and the modern way to integrate with Apache or nginx is to have a stand-alone server, and have apache/nginx be a reverse proxy

[15:59] <comborico1611> Was Web Development in-mind when P6 was designed?

[16:00] <comborico1611> Or is kind of "stretching" it?

[16:00] <comborico1611> or is that stretching it*

[16:01] *** andrzejku joined
[16:01] <moritz> Web development is not a stretch for Perl 6, nor for any other modern, general-purpose language

[16:30] <Nanjizal> I managed to run some hangman fine   doing   perl6 hangman.p6   but when I tried to do it from textmate even after I added a TM_PERL   parameter it would not work and complained.  But now I am trying to run the stuff here https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple 

[16:32] <Nanjizal> But I think mac's have perl 5 preinstalled so half the time it will use that what ever you tell the terminal

[16:33] <Nanjizal> I probably should not change the mac perl version 

[16:33] <moritz> perl5 and perl6 are separate installations

[16:33] <DrForr> I don't use TextMate - All I can say is to look at https://github.com/textmate/perl.tmbundle - there's a Perl 6 .tmbundle file there.

[16:34] *** espadrine left
[16:36] <DrForr> Nanjizal: There is probably an 'Application Helper' or 'Launch' setting in the UI somewhere that tells it what application to launch a given script with. That's what you have to find and change.

[16:36] <Nanjizal> https://pastebin.com/QJqGQ7eY

[16:36] <comborico1611> The code is coming alive!

[16:36] <comborico1611> I thought it was going to be very ugly and confusing, but it is just verbose.

[16:37] <Nanjizal> I commented out my user name to ****

[16:38] <Nanjizal> But as I said with hangman.p6 it seems to work from terminal directly.  It was just more problematic with gtk-simple which I believe is setup for perl6

[16:38] <DrForr> Nanjizal: It's using a Perl 5 .tmbundle resource, not the Perl 6 .tmbundle.

[16:39] <DrForr> Er, I take that bak.

[16:39] <DrForr> *back

[16:39] <Nanjizal> The bottom of the textmate has detected it as Perl 6 code.

[16:40] <DrForr> The Perl stuff I can see has both perl 5 and 6 jammed together in the same .tmbundle file, there's probably something else that needs to be configured.

[16:40] <Nanjizal> I have point TM_PERL to the applications/Rakudo/....  before that it was picking up perl 5

[16:42] <Nanjizal> but I can live with building/compiling it on the terminal at moment.  I was trying to just run the https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple/blob/master/README.md#testing  from terminal and that does not work

[16:43] <Nanjizal> $ prove -e "perl6 -Ilib"

[16:43] <Nanjizal> No tests named and 't' directory not found at /System/Library/Perl/5.18/App/Prove.pm line 528.

[16:44] <DrForr> That means there are no tests to run, so you're running the command in the wrong directory.

[16:44] *** wamba joined
[16:44] <DrForr> 'prove' is meant to run your test scripts automatically. If you don't have any scripts to run, then 'prove' won't do what you want.

[16:45] <Nanjizal> why would it say 5.18

[16:45] <moritz> prove is a Perl 5 tool

[16:45] <moritz> Perl 6 uses the same testing protocol as Perl 5

[16:45] <DrForr> Because App::prove is a Perl 5 binary that you're using to run a perl 6 test suite.

[16:45] <moritz> http://testanything.org/

[16:46] <DrForr> It just happens to be able to launch Perl 6 when need be, that's what the '-e' flag does.

[16:46] <Nanjizal> How do I get to the right directory if I have installed per instruction ? zef install GTK::Simple

[16:47] <DrForr> zef should have already run the tests for you.

[16:47] <moritz> zef install runs the tests for you

[16:49] <Nanjizal> Well I feel a bit lost if I want to see this code running https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple/blob/master/examples/18-cairo-draw-handler.pl6  and then modify it how would I go about that?

[16:50] <DrForr> Clone the repository and run the example.

[16:50] <Nanjizal> Oh ok will do :) 

[16:50] <DrForr> You can probably find the directory in .perl6 but I wouldn't bother.

[16:51] <DrForr> Changing stuff there would muck with the actual Perl 6 code, it's safer to work from a cloned repo so you don't accidentally mess up what's installed.

[17:11] <DrForr> Don't forget to file a bug report :)

[17:13] <Nanjizal> Well it's my first look at perl so difficult to know if it's something I am doing wrong.

[17:14] <Nanjizal> I am wondering, it seems that wrapping c++ is not too hard with Perl 6?

[17:14] <timotimo> Nanjizal: i can help with that, it's my project and my example code

[17:14] <Nanjizal> the Cairo one was not working.  

[17:14] <timotimo> "unwound entire stack and missed handler" is usually when you give a callback to a C library via nativecall, and the callback throws any exception

[17:14] <Nanjizal> it's cloned repository running on mac

[17:15] <timotimo> because it's impossible to unwind over the C portion of the stack that lives between the interpreter (where the C function was invoked) and the inner interpreter (where the callback is being interpreted)

[17:15] <Nanjizal> I have not changed your code I may have renamed the file to something storter that's all

[17:16] <timotimo> that's fine, the code is almost a year untouched :)

[17:16] <DrForr> Nanjizal: What he's saying is that figuring out *what* callback is failing would help. Is there more in the stacktrace?

[17:16] <Nanjizal> Not the way I am runnning it

[17:17] <Nanjizal> is there optional args I should to get more verbose

[17:18] <timotimo> the worst is when the C function calls your callback with a different signature than you expect, because no CATCH you can put into your code can catch that

[17:18] <DrForr> It's probably not going to help in this case. Can you add a 'die;' to the code somewhere to see how far it gets before the callback dies?

[17:18] *** geekosaur left
[17:18] <timotimo> dang, on my system the gtk cairo-draw-handler example script runs fine

[17:19] <Nanjizal> you cloned the repository from scratch?

[17:20] <timotimo> no, but the checkout is clean

[17:20] <timotimo> can you clone the cairo repository, https://github.com/timo/cairo-p6.git and run its tests with perl6 -I . t/blah?

[17:21] <timotimo> ok, looks like there's only one test

[17:21] <timotimo> oh, no, six

[17:21] <Nanjizal> I tried die; it dies at the end!

[17:22] <Nanjizal> so am I right in thinking that these pm6 files are wrapping the c++ code ie: https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall

[17:22] <timotimo> i was convinced i had pulled newest from cairo, but i hadn't!

[17:24] *** geekosaur joined
[17:24] <timotimo> the gtk example still works

[17:25] <Nanjizal> So pm6 files are kind of like 'externs' are in Haxe.  I am wondering do you think it would be feasible to wrap Kore ? 

[17:25] <Nanjizal> https://github.com/Kode/Kore/tree/master/Sources/Kore  

[17:26] <Nanjizal> Because that would be really powerful for Perl 6 for graphics.

[17:26] <timotimo> opengl and directx? is it kind of like SDL2?

[17:27] <Nanjizal> No it recompile the shaders for the platform.

[17:27] <Nanjizal> So on mac it can use metal

[17:27] <Nanjizal> I normally use it via Kha and Haxe.

[17:27] <Nanjizal> it has js stuff as well but the Kore is the C++ stuff

[17:27] <timotimo> right, SDL2 offers graphics primitives that use anything that's available

[17:28] <Nanjizal> No it's lower level

[17:28] <timotimo> http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/4f3cdd0a5768/src/render

[17:28] <timotimo> OK

[17:28] <Nanjizal> http://kha.tech/

[17:29] <Nanjizal> You can code for mobile or whatever directly in Kore but I would use Kha

[17:30] <Nanjizal> But if it's not too hard to wrap it might be really nice graphics api

[17:30] <timotimo> cool. you can check out the nativecall c++ test files in rakudo's t/ folder

[17:44] <timotimo> i agree

[17:44] <geekosaur> it doesn''t automatically do a "say" because we found a bunch of problems with things in sink context and needed to be able to debug them easily, so default is sink context

[19:52] <Zoffix> So I finally got annoyed enough by lack of highlights in GitHub's markdown on perl6 code blocks to see what the hell is up.... The likely cause? "Rename Perl6 to Perl 6" https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3671

[19:53] <El_Che> :)

[19:53] <El_Che> Zoffix++

[19:53] <Zoffix> Which makes it that you need to write ```perl 6``` instead of ```perl6``` in markdown, BUT that detects it as "perl" and highlights with the wrong language

[19:53] <Zoffix> And this was broken since August and no one apparently gave two bits about it, since I re-read the caching comment and it states that cache would've cleared when new changes in repo happen

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> I've seen a lot of people struggling with it actually

[19:55] <Zoffix> Oh, sorry, &nbsp; in it

[20:25] <comborico1611> How do you search PATH for a specific program?

[20:26] <mspo> which program

[20:26] <comborico1611> mysql

[20:26] <mspo> :)

[20:26] <geekosaur> I think they want the perl 6 version, bot the (bad, btw) bash one

[20:27] <geekosaur> *not the

[20:27] <geekosaur> (use "type" or you may be seeing what the next shell will see, not what *yours* sees)

[20:27] <comborico1611> "type mysql" ?

[20:28] <comborico1611> Kubuntu 17 comes packaged with mySQL and it conflicts with my XAMPP in PATH

[20:28] <mspo> which(1) is a program

[20:28] <mspo> although I enjoy "who's on first"

[20:28] <geekosaur> comborico1611, yes

[20:29] <mspo> in perl6 you'd have to do something like split the ENV[PATH] on : and grep over it

[20:29] <mspo> as in, perl grep

[20:29] <geekosaur> *please* do not fall into the linux trap of using which(1)

[20:29] <geekosaur> and if you'd giove be a chance instead of spreading bad shell juju, it's on $*SPEC somewhere

[20:30] <moritz> https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-file-which

[20:31] <comborico1611> Are y'all implying that P6 can be used as a replacement for Bash?

[20:32] <mspo> you can implement the which command in perl6

[20:32] <comborico1611> Oh.

[20:33] <geekosaur> hm, could have sworn there was a predefined one these days

[20:33] <mspo> I think perl6 could be used to write a shell too

[20:33] <comborico1611> So "type mysql" produces /usr/bin/mysql

[20:33] <comborico1611> I tried to open mysql with Kate, but it isn't a text.

[20:33] <comborico1611> I'm not sure what to do from here.

[20:34] <moritz> what do you want to achieve?

[20:34] <geekosaur> if you really wanted to, you could probably get away with using it as a shell. I would not recommend oit. (the old warning for "m4 -e" comes to mind, but linux removed it so I suppose that means it never existed...)

[20:34] <comborico1611> Just delete mysql?

[20:34] <geekosaur> comborico1611, no

[20:34] <geekosaur> what is your actual problem

[20:34] <geekosaur> mysql is a binary executable, not text. it is also probably required by other things, so removing it will probably break something else

[20:34] <comborico1611> I need to replace Kubuntu's packaged mysql in $PATH with XAMPP's mysql

[20:34] <geekosaur> then change $PATH to point to XAMPP's first

[20:34] <comborico1611> I see.

[20:35] <comborico1611> If I just add it to $PATH, will it automatically be first?

[20:35] <comborico1611> or is there some other step to make it first?

[20:35] <geekosaur> export PATH="<the path tot he dir containing the right mysql>:$PATH"

[20:36] <comborico1611> Isn't export only temporary?

[20:36] <geekosaur> you also have to put that command in your shell's startup file

[20:36] <geekosaur> but putting it there does not run it in your currently open shells

[20:36] <comborico1611> etc/profile

[20:36] <mspo> you might want to read some docs on using unix

[20:36] <geekosaur> there is no magic that adds it to both

[20:36] <geekosaur> no, *your* shell startup, boit the systemwide one

[20:36] <geekosaur> not the

[20:36] <geekosaur> ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile

[20:37] <comborico1611> Hmm.  Okay. 

[20:37] <moritz> or, like, follow the instructions for the stuff you're currently installing

[20:37] <geekosaur> the system does not consist solely of the shell you are typing into. changing things systemwide based on what your current environment needs can break your system

[21:05] <Zoffix> More precisely: `use Config::JSON "some-file.json"; say jconf "key";` to use data from "some-file.json". But if some other comp unit in the same program does `use Config::JSON "some-other-file.json"` then for `jconf` inside that comp unit to use "some-other-file.json"

[21:17] <comborico1611> This was as a hobby?

[21:17] <mspo> but i was writing dos batch scripts and using that command line too

[21:17] <mspo> <shrug> it was just part of my life

[21:17] <comborico1611> Did you have a Compac Presario?

[21:18] * geekosaur just poked around a lot, and looked for docs on anything found

[21:18] <geekosaur> this seems to be a lost art

[21:18] <comborico1611> I remember going into Sears and seeing their Computer Section.  Back then a screen saver was like a game.

[21:19] <comborico1611> geekosaur, I don't think I have the mental ability to learn that way.

[21:19] <mspo> compaq and no I had an IBM PS/1 tower

[21:19] <mspo> comborico1611: I got OS/2 Warp 4 for christmas one year

[21:19] <comborico1611> Did you get it from Sears?

[21:19] <mspo> from Dillards

[21:19] *** Alikzus joined
[21:19] <comborico1611> You know, my Presario could have come from Dillards. 

[21:19] <comborico1611> I don't remember which.

[21:20] <geekosaur> that's not mental ability, really. my mom was convinced of that as well... then she learned to do it. from watching me, basically.

[21:20] <pmurias> comborico1611: I learned UNIX and Perl from a books when I was a kid

[21:20] <pmurias> s/a//

[21:20] <mspo> I installed FreeBSD 2.something on it from CD ROMS that I got for free from a local computer/book store

[21:20] <geekosaur> it's not lack of ability, it's self-doubt

[21:20] <mspo> and then since I could no longer play sim city I reinstalled DOS

[21:21] <pmurias> comborico1611: I guess there are plenty of UNIX books (even online in PDF form)

[21:21] <geekosaur> if anything, it's easier these days: install vbox, install something in it. shut down vbox and copy the vm. then restart vbox and play around

[21:21] <geekosaur> mess something up? shut down and copy your backup back over it

[21:21] <mspo> yeah I was constantly installing operating systems on our family's only computer

[21:21] <comborico1611> geekosaur, could be.  I'm on a time-constraint, though.  I need to get a job before this summer.  It must be computing due to a disease I suffer from.

[21:21] *** zoosha left
[21:21] <mspo> and had to get it fixed by the next day or someone would be angry

[21:22] <comborico1611> That's back when a good Start-up Floppy Disk was like gold.

[21:22] <mspo> a lot of programmers don't know how to use computers

[21:23] <mspo> do you know how to use windows?

[21:23] <comborico1611> geekosaur, so I bring up time-constraints because fishing-around for info is much much slower than a good book.

[21:23] <comborico1611> I haven't used Windows in years.

[21:24] <mspo> you've been running linux for years?

[21:24] <comborico1611> I got away from computers for like 15 years.

[21:24] <mspo> oh

[21:24] <comborico1611> Probably 10 years.

[21:24] <comborico1611> Ubuntu-only.

[21:24] <comborico1611> I tried Red Hat, back in the early 2000s.  I couldn't get it installed.

[21:25] <comborico1611> I wanted to be a programmer in the 8th grade.  I bought a C++ book.

[21:25] <geekosaur> I'm not sure linux has improved that much since then :)

[21:25] <comborico1611> I finished that book the beginning of this summer.

[21:25] <moritz> geekosaur: it has

[21:25] *** Nanjizal left
[21:25] <comborico1611> Ubuntu is so good.  VERY user friendly.

[21:26] <moritz> you install it on a laptop. Out of the box, hardware 3D graphics and wifi works

[21:26] <geekosaur> [06 21:26:06] <Sequell> linley henzell[6/7]: Henzell discussing his programming ability: "You see, I gave up on Borland's [C++] manual (which is very good, I'm just lazy) when it started talking about pointers [....] After pointers came structs, enums, pragmas, classes, macros, and a whole lot of other stuff which still means nothing to me."

[21:26] <comborico1611> I remember the first time I saw Ubuntu boot-up.  I was at a university and some guy started his laptop.  

[21:26] <moritz> nearly unthinkable 10 years ago

[21:26] <mspo> indeed

[21:27] <mspo> I recall manually iterating video settings from my x config file

[21:27] <mspo> after scanning the probe results from the logs

[21:27] <geekosaur> moritz, except I installed it on an HP laptop

[21:27] <mspo> learning about weird commands like xvidtune

[21:27] *** Ven`` left
[21:28] <geekosaur> wired network worked. wifi still doesn't. video is dubious.

[21:28] <geekosaur> ("works" at boot time. run the config utility, or plug/unplug a monitor, and it explodes.)

[21:28] <mspo> comborico1611: imho the easiest/best way to get a php job is to get really good at wordpress

[21:28] <comborico1611> mspo, (or anyone else) I have this book.  Do you think it would suffice for learning UNIX, or is it TOO INDEPTH? https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Systems-Programming-Communication-Concurrency/dp/0134424077/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1515274100&sr=8-3&keywords=unix+system

[21:29] <comborico1611> mspo, thanks!  I appreciate the tip!

[21:29] <geekosaur> comborico1611, I would start out by learning how to navigate unix first. as mspo mentioned early, Evi Nemeth's books are good for that

[21:29] <mspo> why not just start with W. Richard Stevens  (lol)

[21:29] <geekosaur> I would expect that particular book to be about advanced C programming.

[21:29] <comborico1611> I actually did that.

[21:29] <geekosaur> with Unix APIs

[21:30] <geekosaur> oh, dear.

[21:30] <comborico1611> lol

[21:30] <geekosaur> stevens is where you go for the in-depth details of how unix networking works.

[21:30] <geekosaur> not by any means beginner fare

[21:30] <comborico1611> I can attest to that.

[21:30] <mspo> yes I was joking

[21:31] *** kerframil joined
[21:31] <mspo> Evi Nemeth books are tops

[21:31] <mspo> UNIX Power Tools is a solid classic as well

[21:31] <comborico1611> I hate books with several authors . . .

[21:31] <mspo> although a little dated

[21:31] * geekosaur grins

[21:31] <mspo> <shrug>

[21:31] <mspo> I've read unix power tools and linux admin handbook cover to cover multiple times

[21:31] <mspo> of course, it's my career

[21:32] <mspo> I have tcp/ip illustrated on a shelf un-read

[21:32] <comborico1611> Me, too.

[21:32] <comborico1611> lol

[21:32] * geekosaur contributed the section on bsd vs. system V terminal stuff to UPT vol 1. of course by the time it was published, POSIX termios had taken over and it was obsolete >.>

[21:33] <comborico1611> Man, that is rough.

[21:33] <mspo> geekosaur: very tool

[21:33] <geekosaur> I had Illustrated on a shelf as well... for others to reference, since I had more or less become the department's reference librarian at that point

[21:33] <mspo> geekosaur: UPT was my go-to as a jr sysadmin
