[08:55] <ZzZombo> Or for any other language.

[09:00] <ZzZombo> well, it's one thing to forbid unsupported (invalid) syntax, even tho I don't really agree with mentioning C++ or any other language for that matter. It's another going out of your way to forbid valid syntax just because some other language also uses it (?).

[09:03] <AlexDaniel> it was meant to be helpful in case somebody writes that by mistake‚Ä¶ A for effort I guess :)

[09:04] <lizmat> I suggest we implement "no isms <C++>"

[09:04] <lizmat> and then consider making "no isms" a default for 6.e

[09:05] <AlexDaniel> .e? Doesn't have to be that far I think

[09:06] <AlexDaniel> well, as long as there's enough devpower to make that happen earlier

[11:12] <Zoffix> And probably do the work for it on an ongoing basis. Just so there isn't 3000 commits to review by the end.

[11:13] <Zoffix> And I imagine somewhere by [middle of] October there will be a changelog for 6.d released to users, and that would basically be a cutoff for all 6.d features.

[11:13] <Zoffix> Switching to "6.e" as our new go-to version for new features isn't a bad a idea :)

[14:52] <timotimo> hello louisono 

[14:53] <timotimo> we have many different ways to learn perl6, depending on how you like to learn

[14:53] <louisono> actually I'm reading a book

[14:53] <timotimo> oh, cool, so you've already got something in front of you

[14:53] <louisono> Perl6 Fundamentals

[14:53] *** robertle left
[14:53] <timotimo> i think i have that in my bookshelf as well

[14:54] <timotimo> do you have a particular question?

[14:54] <louisono> yes. At some point in the book's code there a double semi-colon ';;' at the end of a line

[14:54] <louisono> I was wondering what it meant?

[14:55] *** yqt joined
[14:55] <timotimo> if i'm not forgetting something, double semicolons are only ever relevant inside of parenthesis when you're declaring a sub

[14:55] <timotimo> so it's probably just a typo

[14:56] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v yqt

[14:56] <louisono> at first i thought it was a typo but then when changing the code the double semicolon happens again at an equivalent place in the code

[14:56] <timotimo> if you remember the page number i can take a closer look

[14:57] <louisono> thanks! it is at the end the chapter about testing page 35

[14:58] <timotimo> yes, that looks just like a typo

[14:58] <timotimo> it's not a mistake, it's just meaningless there

[14:58] <louisono> ok, thanks for your help :)

[14:59] <timotimo> moritz: ^ in case that's not already in your bugtracker or what you have

[14:59] <timotimo> feel free to stay around or come back for when you have more questions :)

[15:00] <louisono> thank you for welcoming newcomers such as me so nicely!

[15:01] <timotimo> \o/

[15:01] <moritz> indeed, a (harmless) typo that none of my proof-readers has caught

[16:19] <Zoffix> ccc_: the `(1,2,3) eqv [1,2,3]` is false, because one is an immutable List, while the other is a mutable Array. The item thing places things that are collections of many items (like lists) into a Scalar container, so that the entire collection gets treated like a single entity in things like looping or list flattening. There's an article on containers: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/

[23:49] <perlBird> hello! could somebody potentially help a fellow out with a simple thing ?

[23:49] <timotimo> we can certainly try!

[23:50] <perlBird> brilliant! I'm trying to send a post request with a json payload

[23:50] <perlBird> using the WWW module

[23:50] <timotimo> OK

[23:51] <perlBird> and I keep running into an error that looks like so:

[23:51] <perlBird> https://gist.github.com/cryptobird/4d93135f58950fb0b08b2ac0e7a1b95f

[23:52] <timotimo> ah, looks like you're passing the headers as a literal hash, but the subs expect to get it slipped in

[23:52] <timotimo> i.e. a bunch of named arguments, or alternatively |%the-header-hash

[23:52] <perlBird> that seemed to do the trick! 

[23:53] <perlBird> I was way overthinking it lol

[23:53] <timotimo> hum, but the synopsis looks different

[23:53] <timotimo> ah i was looking at the wrong one

[23:55] <perlBird> now I'm just getting a 400 error, but i expect I just don't understand how WWW wants the JSON to come

[23:56] <timotimo> are you familiar with network sniffers like wireshark? or you can just use strace which is much simpler to get running, but a bit noisier to look at

[23:57] <perlBird> never really used anything of the like

[23:58] <timotimo> do you have control over the webserver you're connecting to?

[23:59] <perlBird> nah, it's just like a ctf thing for an online job posting lol
