[09:00] <mikejw> hi

[09:00] <jmerelo> mikejw: o/

[09:01] <mikejw> how do I change where perl6 looks for installed modules?

[09:02] <moritz> why do you want to change it?

[09:03] <mikejw> I just want to run zef from my home dir

[09:03] <mikejw> I'm on gentoo

[09:04] *** isBEKaml joined
[09:04] *** noganex joined
[09:04] <moritz> and it doesn't work out of the box?

[09:05] <mikejw> I've created an alias in .bashrc to ~/code/zef/bin/zef

[09:05] <mikejw> "Could not find Zef::CLI at line 3 in:

[09:06] <mikejw> (a bunch of paths)

[09:06] <moritz> but that looks like zef itself isn't properly installed

[09:06] <moritz> in the zef source dir, run perl6 -Ilib bin/zef install .

[09:06] <moritz> (the trailing . is important)

[09:08] <lookatme> you can install zef in your home

[09:08] <lookatme> if you are using rakudo-pkg, there is a script in the /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin

[09:11] <mikejw> ah ok it installs to ~/.perl6/bin :)

[09:12] *** zakharyas left
[09:13] <mikejw> thanks

[09:13] <mikejw> does anything like App::Spec exist in perl6? longshot maybe

[09:15] <mikejw> btw I <3 perl

[09:15] *** wamba joined
[09:16] <moritz> mikejw: I'm usually happy with the built-in MAIN mechanism, but I know there are several modules on http://modules.perl6.org that try to provide an even smoother experience

[09:16] <mikejw> cool, I'll take a look!

[09:22] *** zakharyas joined
[09:27] <jmerelo> mikejw: what's app::spec? I'll check it out.

[09:28] <jmerelo> mikejw: OK, I see... https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Spec

[09:28] <jmerelo> mikejw: you can do basically the same in the signature of the MAIN function in Perl 6. You can even have many different ones using multis

[09:29] <jmerelo> mikejw: and please ask these questions, even if already answered, also in StackOverflow :-)

[09:29] <mikejw> will do. cheers :)

[09:30] <jmerelo> and I see now moritz answer :-) 

[09:31] <jmerelo> Anyone wants to have a look at this question in SO? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50210456/how-can-i-use-the-perl6-regex-metasyntax-foo-regex Really hairy grammar/regex issue

[09:44] <mikejw> tyring to think of a good name for my first perl6 project.. thinking of going with gordon

[09:45] <mikejw> haha

[09:46] <mikejw> batman! even better :D

[09:53] <mikejw> jmerelo: you were right though it was flash gordon inspired.. attempting to think laterally on from 'hashicorp'.

[09:56] <mikejw> gordon will be powerfull

[09:57] <jmerelo> That means we are probably in the same age bracket... nobody I know below 40 has heard about Flash Gordon, Ming and the rest of the crew...

[15:26] <jmerelo> timotimo: that's what I gleaned from the examples you laid out yesterday...

[15:26] <jmerelo> timotimo: you got it.

[15:27] <timotimo> why would you have -> $_ where $_ ~~ Rat instead of -> Rat $_ ?

[15:27] <jmerelo> timotimo: that too

[15:28] <moritz> also "where $_ ~~ Rat" could be written shorter as "where Rat"

[15:28] <jmerelo> m: say [[1,2,3],[[4,5],6.1,7.2]].duckmap( -> Rat $_ { $_¬≤} );

[15:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ae0526f2: OUTPUT: ¬´[[1 2 3] [[4 5] 37.21 51.84]]‚ê§¬ª

[15:28] <moritz> since "where" implies a smart-match

[15:35] <mikejw> trying to do a makeshift 'heredoc' using an array. litte confused by the output. I've tried putting curly braces around each line https://pastebin.com/Uw5Y7BQe

[15:36] <timotimo> if you put < > around the data, you'll get the , in with the strings

[15:36] <timotimo> why don't you just use a heredoc?

[15:37] <timotimo> https://pastebin.com/22PQhzHT

[15:39] <mikejw> awesome thanks!  sorry bad googling

[15:39] <timotimo> :)

[15:40] <timotimo> what did you google? we could try improving the docs to make it more easily found

[15:40] <jmerelo> timotimo: and/or post that question in StackOverflow, but you know that already :-)

[15:41] <timotimo> searching "[perl6] heredoc" on stackoverflow gives you two answers that point at the :to quoting feature

[15:41] <timotimo> and googling "perl6 heredoc" (or "heredocs"?) gives you an perl6 advent calendar post from 2013 that also seems very good

[15:41] <mikejw> I'm sure I tried 'perl6 heredoc'. must be the heat making me go blind 

[15:42] <timotimo> i wouldn't blame you :)

[15:43] <timotimo> i get perl6-centric results more easily because google knows i'm interested in perl6

[15:43] <timotimo> that can skew results significantly

[15:52] <yoleaux> 13:02Z <lizmat> stmuk: see http://pl6anet.org

[15:52] <stmuk> hmmm not sure I can fix that (apart from removing the feed from pl6anet.org)

[15:52] <jmerelo> stmuk: I'm listening. Also, not sure about "we". I am doing it (maybe a bit over the top)

[15:54] <stmuk> its just we never know who is going to buy stackoverflow and what they do with the questions which are probably their IP

[15:54] <stmuk> look what happened to sourceforge!

[15:55] <jmerelo> stmuk: I just moved my stuff to GitHub. 

[15:56] <jmerelo> stmuk: don't know, man. It's kind of a personal thing. I can be annoying at times, but the fact is that people code by StackOverflow and learn by StackOverflow. If we populate it with perl 6 questions, it will be easier for people to learn it.

[15:56] *** Khisanth joined
[15:56] <stmuk> github is different since there is less lockin (its basically just a git remote for many) also things like the wiki are open and just wiki repos

[15:57] <stmuk> not sure how exportable the gh issues are however

[15:57] <jmerelo> If you don't want to do that, fair enough. If I get too annoying, just tell me so, it's also fair. 

[15:57] <jmerelo> stmuk: they're accessible through the API. SO questions and answers too, to be fair.

[16:24] <El_Che> stmuk: yes and no. At opencsw we had an SO clone (even when Solaris was still popular and the project had many users). It was a graveyard

[16:25] <El_Che> The main infra that needs to be good is the doc site

[16:25] <El_Che> it should be the canonical source

[16:25] <jmerelo> pmurias: I do that quite proactively, even asking people what they find missing. That's why it's good to post stuff in StackOverflow

[16:26] <jmerelo> stmuk: still, the bare directory... not nice. But if it's intended, no problem.

[16:26] <stmuk> jmerelo: its not directly linked from anywhere. why would it matter?

[16:27] <stmuk> I suppose what I'd personally like is a sort of cross between the old use.perl.org and perlmonks.org (but without the legacy issues and perl5 focus of the latter)

[16:27] <jmerelo> stmuk: dunno. It's probably a tiny bit safer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2530372/how-do-i-disable-directory-browsing

[16:30] <El_Che> (specially perlmonks, the blog, perldoc)

[16:31] <moritz> perlmonks could prosper if they had proper usability

[16:31] <jmerelo> This just in. GitHub runs API https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ww-gdp-newsletter-201805 Will have to check it out...

[16:34] <stmuk> ironically the laptop driver support on OpenBSD is the best of the BSDs

[16:35] <timotimo> if you're not allergic to rails, there's this cool thing from, i think, jeff atwood? it's called discourse or something?

[16:51] <jkramer> Also having P6 stuff on SO might have an advertising effect because people randomly stumbling over a P6 question (and answer) might see how awesome P6 is :)

[18:46] <chrom> so..how can i dig into such an issue?

[18:46] <timotimo> many different ways

[18:46] <timotimo> something i like to do is launch the program with perl6-gdb-m, set a breakpoint in MVM_panic, then "up" once or twice, and then "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)"

[18:47] *** unicodable6 joined
[18:49] <chrom> seems worth a try :)

[18:49] <timotimo> if you have a grammar, you can also put a { say Backtrace.new.full } in the middle

[18:49] <chrom> no grammars yet

[18:50] <timotimo> OK, but that code in particular can also go into a regular regex

[18:50] <chrom> wondering whether i have less problems running perl6 on linux?

[18:52] <chrom> not even forced

[18:53] <timotimo> oh, what kind of output do you get?

[18:53] <timotimo> ah, also, what version of rakudo star do you have?

[18:53] <timotimo> if you're using an up-to-date zef with an older rakudo, it might explode

[18:54] <chrom> rakudo Start 2018.91 morvm 2018.01

[18:54] <chrom> *star

[18:54] <timotimo> that's hella new :P

[18:55] <timotimo> just today we released rakudo star 2018.04 :D

[18:55] <chrom> mhm

[18:55] <timotimo> but rakudo star comes with its own fixed version of zef that should work fine with it

[18:56] <chrom> so better i get new source of rakudo star and build it again?

[18:56] <timotimo> i'm a fan of getting the latest release, i'm biased :)

[20:25] <El_Che> in my repl once returns an array, the other a list

[20:25] <moritz> how is "a:" parsed there? as a label?

[20:25] <moritz> or as a call?

[20:25] <Kaypie> call

[20:26] <moritz> nope

[20:27] <Kaypie> ah

[20:27] <Kaypie> an identifier?

[20:27] <moritz> and in the REPL, it doesn't complain, because it uses the expression (to print it)

[20:27] <El_Che> aaah

[22:45] <Tison> .ask moritz I found a regex like `regex key { <![#\[]> <-[;=]>+ }` and wonder what's the different between <![...]> and  <-[...]>. BTW, the former isn't documented.

[22:45] <yoleaux> Tison: I'll pass your message to moritz.

[22:46] <Tison> It looks like the former is an assertion while the latter really matches something

[22:48] <Tison> our documentation on assertion only shows look-around assertions but no general assertion forms

[22:50] <timotimo> yeah, if you have a ? or ! after the < it becomes a zero-width matching assertion

[22:52] <Juerd> As I understand, <-[x]> is short for <!before [x]>

[22:52] <Juerd> err

[22:52] <Juerd> As I understand, <![x]> is short for <!before [x]>

[22:53] <Juerd> Or actually, probably <!before <[x]>>.

[22:53] <timotimo> it's more that you can't just put any regex syntax after the <! part, so in order to have a regular piece of regex there, you have to have a word there, and the best word was "before"

[22:53] <timotimo> like, <!before foo> is the same as <!foo> but <!"foo"> isn't valid syntax
