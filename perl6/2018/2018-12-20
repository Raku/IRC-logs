[06:45] <holyghost> jmerelo : I have an unmanaged X11 window (with dragging and resizing) which I need to write a widget kit for, for a perl6 IDE

[06:45] <holyghost> I wrote it back in the past for making X11 clients

[06:46] <holyghost> I need to wait though since I'm going to put design patterns in it and X11 Xlib widgets

[06:47] <jmerelo> holyghost: is X11 still a thing? I thought that X.org and Wayland were all the rage nowadays

[06:47] <holyghost> I have to read up for the implementation. I ordered the smalltalk companion of design patterns

[06:47] <holyghost> right

[06:48] <holyghost> It's linux, BSD based

[06:49] <jmerelo> holyghost: that's not a thing either. If it's linux, it's got the Linux kernel. If it's BSD, it's got the BSD kernel. You can have an otherwise-linuxy. OS with a BSD kernel, but the kernel defines the OS.

[06:49] <holyghost> these operating systems should support it

[06:49] *** nebuchad` is now known as nebuchadnezzar

[06:49] <holyghost> sure

[06:49] <jmerelo> holyghost: ah, OK. multi-OS

[06:49] <holyghost> I'll manage

[06:49] <holyghost> indeed

[06:50] <holyghost> it's just C drawn into C++ windowy thingies

[11:36] <harmth> Hi, can someone explain to me, or point me to the documentation, to why returning a list from a method and assigning it to an @-variable is different from doing the same except with a subroutine?

[11:36] <harmth> Example here: https://pastebin.com/skxVDF2F

[11:37] *** harmth is now known as HarmtH

[11:37] <jnthn> harmth: $.bar means $(self.bar)

[11:37] <jnthn> So you're itemizing the result of the call

[11:38] <jnthn> Just write self.bar, or @.bar

[12:12] <tobs`> Is there a best practice for shipping 3rd party code with my module, which is used by Build.pm? I'm currently using a git submodule to avoid copying all the files over, but I don't know if zef can be made to check that out before trying to build the module. I assume this would also be incompatible with CPAN?

[12:14] <timotimo> well, cpan is based on tarballs

[12:14] *** Scimon left
[12:14] <timotimo> and it's probably not encouraged for a cpan dist to hit the network to download extra stuff?

[12:14] <timotimo> maybe zef could be made to pull every git repo with --recursive by default?

[12:17] <tobs`> I'll check it out

[12:18] <timotimo> by "made to" i'm suggesting a pullrequest to zef if that wasn't clear

[12:18] <jnthn> I guess for a CPAN tarball I'd just bundle the stuff inside of it

[19:14] <lucasb> in '(something).Foo', if something is defined, then I would expect a defined Foo object

[19:14] <lucasb> but when something is undefined, and it still makes sense the coercion, would you expect a *defined* Foo object or the Foo type object itself?

[19:17] <lucasb> or maybe you think $undefvar.Foo should always die to avoid gratuitous coercions between type objects?

[19:21] <jmerelo> lucasb: that's a good question for StackOverflow

[19:21] <jmerelo> lucasb: there's also $undefvar.?Foo, which might return Foo only if Foo is defined for that particular kind of undefinition...

[19:22] <jmerelo> Also, depends on what you mean by undefined. For many variable it might mean Any or Mu... 

[19:24] *** daotoad left
[19:26] <lucasb> by 'undefined' I mean the type object, as in 'my Bar $bar', $bar is undefined, so it's the type object Bar

[19:31] <moritz> timotimo: it is not

[19:31] <moritz> timotimo: but maybe we should create a ?. that is

[19:31] <lucasb> ^^ I mean thing like these, while Hash.Hash return Hash (ok!), an arbitrary type object like Foo.Hash returns an actual hash

[19:32] <lucasb> *a concrete hash

[19:33] <lucasb> "Yeah, let's make Hash.Hash return a defined hash" NO! :D I meant to propose the other way: make SomeArbitraryTypeObject.Hash return the Hash type object

[19:35] <lucasb> but taking this idea to the extreme, you reach things like should 'Numeric.Numeric' return itself or an real number (+ warning) ? :)

[19:36] <lucasb> m: dd (Int.Int, quietly Int.Numeric)  # a little funny to me :)

[19:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar bfff01a55: OUTPUT: ¬´(Int, 0)‚ê§¬ª

[19:36] <timotimo> yeah, that *is* funny

[19:36] <timotimo> i mean, Int is already an Int, so no-op should be fine

[19:36] <timotimo> but Int is also already a Numeric, so that should also be a no-op, then?

[19:36] <timotimo> anyway, gotta AFK for a bit

[19:47] <lucasb> Yeah, I think timotimo touched on yet another detail: In '$subclass.SuperClass', you asked an object of type SuperClass, but $subclass *isa* SuperClass ('cause SubClass extends SuperClass), so it should be fine to return itself

[19:48] <lucasb> But I think objects in the P6 API goes the extra effort of converting to a parent class type

[20:47] *** HarmtH joined
[20:47] <ryn1x> Maybe a better question is I need to pass a Blob to a native call function for it to fill.. I then want to be able to manipulate that data in a normal perl6 type so I can use things like Math::Matrix

[20:48] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v HarmtH

[20:48] *** natrys left
[20:48] <ryn1x> I can pass the nativecall function a buf32, but I either want to convert what it fill to floats, or just pass it an appropriate data type that will auto fill at floats

[20:49] <timotimo> sounds like the API of that module should be changed to also accept CArray

[20:50] <ryn1x> hmm... let me try that. thanks.

[20:51] <timotimo> i asked xliff to investigate if changing the type constraint in the native called function to Positional[intblah] would work properly with Buf, Blob, native arrays, and CArrays

[20:51] <timotimo> also i suppose Pointer[intblah] would also be acceptable

[20:52] <ryn1x> cool

[20:53] <timotimo> i don't think there was a result yet. maybe you want to investigate that instead? :D

[20:55] <Xliff> m: use NativeCall; sub a(Positional[uint8] $p) { say "{$p.^name} is Fine" }; my uint8 @a = ^10; my $b = Blob[uint8].new(@a); my $c = CArray[uint8].new(@a); a(@a); a($b); a($c)

[20:55] <Xliff> So... yes! ;)

[20:55] <timotimo> that's not "is native" though

[20:55] <timotimo> which is where my worry comes from. though it should probably be fine
