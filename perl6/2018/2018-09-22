[02:44] <TimToady> well, :ii is a substitution adverb that implies :i, so it has to go on the substitution, since it implies changing the case of the right side

[02:45] <TimToady> but you don't need that here, so the :i could go either outside or inside the slash (or even inside the 'before'

[02:47] *** mcmillhj left
[02:48] <lindylex> TimToady that is what I read.

[02:49] <lindylex> my $e20 = "Jump to Jump the left and then to the right again.  :: ";   $e20 ~~ s:i/ <?before  jump> / "⇑ "/;

[02:49] <lindylex> This does not change anything.

[02:53] <TimToady> looks like a bug

[02:54] <TimToady> m: my $e20 = "Jump to Jump the left and then to the right again.  :: ";   $e20 ~~ s/ <?before :i jump> / "⇑ "/; say $e20

[02:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ee5f7577: OUTPUT: « "⇑ "Jump to Jump the left and then to the right again.  :: ␤»

[02:55] <TimToady> helps if I spell it right

[02:56] <lindylex> It only works like this $e20 ~~ s:g:i/ <?before Jump> / "⇑ "/;

[02:56] <TimToady> well, <[jJ]> works there too

[02:57] <lindylex> Sorry that also works.  The character you suggest is a nice solution.

[02:57] <TimToady> but :i ought to work in any of 3 different positions

[02:57] <lindylex> 2 hours later.  I hate bugs!

[03:44] <Herby_> rookie question as I walk through Learning Perl 6, trying to grab data file

[03:44] <Herby_> sometimes when I try to use cURL to grab a github txt file, it'll properly download and save the text file. other times it'll download all the html from the github page

[03:44] <Herby_> for instance: https://github.com/briandfoy/LearningPerl6_Downloads/blob/master/DataFiles/butterfly_census.txt

[03:45] <Herby_> if I try to cURL -O that, it downloads the html

[03:56] <lindylex> Herby_ one sec I can help.

[03:57] <Herby_> k

[03:58] <lindylex> Herby_ : is this what you want to do ?  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briandfoy/LearningPerl6_Downloads/master/DataFiles/butterfly_census.txt

[03:59] <Herby_> not sure. I'm on Windows 10, wget isnt recognized in my terminal. was trying to figure out cURL since that is not installed on W10 and I havent really used it before

[03:59] <Herby_> but i'm sure the gist is the same. download the document as a text file

[03:59] <geekosaur> it's the url thatmatters, no the command

[04:00] <geekosaur> soit'll work with curl -O

[04:01] <lindylex> This works for me also.  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briandfoy/LearningPerl6_Downloads/master/DataFiles/butterfly_census.txt

[04:01] <Herby_> geekosaur: sometimes that does work. but in this example, curl -O downloads it as a html document

[04:01] <Herby_> hmmm

[04:01] <geekosaur> did you see :"its theurl"?

[04:01] <geekosaur> raw.githubusercontent.com is not github,.com

[04:01] *** araraloren left
[04:02] <geekosaur> github serves the actual file data from the raw.githubusercontent.com url

[04:03] <Herby_> geekosaur: ahhh, ok. i got it working now

[04:03] <Herby_> thanks lindylex: i didnt see the difference in the url

[04:03] <lindylex> Herby_ you can get wget here https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/wget/1.11.4-1/

[04:04] <Herby_> lindylex: i'll take a look, thanks. for simple uses, are they roughly the same?

[04:04] <lindylex> this wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe

[04:04] <lindylex> They have some overlap.  

[04:04] <lindylex> Lots of overlap.

[04:06] <geekosaur> wget is more gnuish, curl is more bsdish, if that doesn't mean anything to you, stick to the one you know. in fact, probably just stick to the one you know anyway; there's little to gain from having both

[04:07] <Herby_> i know neither. since cURL comes with W10 now, i'll stick to it

[04:09] <lindylex> Good to know it come with it.

[04:27] <geekosaur> btu really, thats' part of the gnu vs. bsd, the thoght processes behind how things work

[04:28] <Voldenet> fun fact, powershell has curl and wget aliases

[04:28] <Voldenet> and they both point to the same command ;)

[14:01] <MasterDuke> leont: take this with a whole salt shaker, but i think mi6 mostly just helps set up your files in the right directory structure, but assixt also helps with uploading to cpan and things like that

[14:02] <leont> mi6 also uploads to cpan, in fact it's from the same author as CPAN::Uploader::Tiny (that's used by both)

[14:03] <timotimo> i think mi6 also uploads to cpan

[14:03] <timotimo> yeah

[14:04] <MasterDuke> ah, good to know

[14:12] <tyil> fwiw, assixt also uses CPAN::Uploader::Tiny internally to upload to CPAN

[14:13] <timotimo> i think that's what leont meant by "used by both"

[14:17] <tyil> ah

[14:17] <tyil> yes, that makes sense when re-reading it

[14:21] <tyil> leont: if you can confirm the MR resolves your issue, I can merge it into master and make a new release of Pod::To::Pager :)

[14:42] <leont> Fails to install with «Could not find Pod::To::Pager::Binary»

[14:44] <leont> Probably because zef (via TAP::Harness) adds the local blib path and not PERL6PATH, while that test is spawning a new perl6

[17:27] <Demos[m]> unlike ruby however the run sub works properly

[17:27] <jmerelo> Demos[m]: great! Best of luck. Other stuff is like Ruby, if you know it, like mix-ins. Did you see the Perl 6 from Ruby document?

[17:28] <Demos[m]> I delayed learning p6 for a long time because there's no semantic tooling

[17:28] <El_Che> Demos[m]: welcome

[17:28] <Demos[m]> no, I don't know ruby that well. I'm mainly a c++ and nim programmer

[17:28] <El_Che> Demos[m]: ruby was fun for me as well

[17:28] <Demos[m]> but when I learned ruby I found it fun!

[17:29] <Demos[m]> I absolutely love the attitude of perl though

[17:29] <Demos[m]> espicially coming from the C++ area

[18:26] <fake_space_whale> Is there a way to delete an element from the middle of an array? (preferably by value)

[18:26] <fake_space_whale> something like @a.remove(5) 

[18:26] <jmerelo> fake_space_whale: in-place?

[18:27] <TimToady> splice if you want everything to shift down

[18:27] <TimToady> @a[$elem]:delete if you want to leave an undefined value there

[18:27] <fake_space_whale> Splice is likely what I want then.

[18:27] <fake_space_whale> Thank you

[18:31] *** Zoffix joined
[18:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[18:31] <Zoffix> fake_space_whale: and for by-value version you can simply use .grep with .= metaop

[18:31] <Zoffix> m: my @a = <a b c d f b g e>; @a .= grep: none 'b'; dd @a

[18:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22edce40: OUTPUT: «Array @a = ["a", "c", "d", "f", "g", "e"]␤»

[18:32] <fake_space_whale> oh that is just what I was looking for. Thank you.

[18:34] <TimToady> m: say not 'b'

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar b22edce40: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[18:34] <fake_space_whale> Though I realized that I should actually be using SetHashs for what I am doing, since I really just care about membership.

[18:35] <TimToady> we could catch people using not or ! on literals and teach them to use 'none' instead

[18:35] <TimToady> much like we catch people using literal True or False in smartmatch

[18:38] <TimToady> fake_space_whale: or BagHash if there can be multiples of the same key

[18:40] <TimToady> in either case, $setorbag{$elem}-- should do what you want

[20:52] <mithaldu_> TimToady: never heard of them, but due to the war some background is lost, and due to east germany many of the religious connections were broken

[20:53] <TimToady> nodnod

[20:53] <mithaldu_> also, now that i think of it, my father was adopted, so he may even come from a different family, but took the name

[20:55] <TimToady> so maybe you're my fifth cousin-in-law :)

[20:57] *** vrurg joined
[20:57] <mithaldu_> haha, maybe :D

[20:57] <mithaldu_> i know of at least two other walde men and they're far apart

[20:57] <Juerd> lizmat: catchup's making me drool. This is so cool for quick wins in existing code!

[20:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v vrurg

[20:58] <lizmat> yeah, I like it too  :-)

[20:58] <TimToady> and maybe we're both related to Tiger Woods :)

[20:58] <mithaldu_> hmmm! i never got into golf much ;)

[20:59] <TimToady> Walde -> Woods is a pretty common anglicization, I believe

[21:02] <mithaldu_> wow, yeah, i actually failed to draw the connection

[21:02] <mithaldu_> i nver really translate walde into anything with meaning, mentally

[21:02] <lizmat> Juerd: I was thinking of using it in a from-json parser

[21:03] <lizmat> first find the outer { }, and handle those with a catchup

[21:03] <lizmat> just "make catchup { stuff }

[21:03] <lizmat> "

[21:05] <pmurias> everytime we end up with json parsing bottleneck I always wonder how fast would having a nqp::parsejson be ;)

[21:05] <pmurias> * bottlenecks

[21:06] <lizmat> JSON::Fast is pretty close to that already

[21:06] <lizmat> all it needs is some strategic catchup  :-)

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> tony-o, timotimo: so what's the plan with JSON::Fast?

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> is anybody working on making it happen, or is everyone thinking that somebody else will do it? :)

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> afaik there's no ticket

[22:25] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: I'm not familiar with a lot that is talked about in that ticket but if I'm understanding things right, the proposed changes will significantly speed-up Zef?

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: correct, more than 6 times for looking up a module

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> you can try something like this:

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> time zef --dry --/test --/build install JSON::Fast

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> or any other module

[22:26] <AlexDaniel> (that is not installed)

[22:27] <Herby_> nice

[22:27] <AlexDaniel> I mean, that line of code does practically nothing (no building, testing or installing performed)

[22:28] <Herby_> i mean that 6x speed up is nice

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> yet it takes 11 seconds for me

[22:28] <Herby_> i'm not able to test that line at the moment

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> so a chunk of that will be 6x faster

[22:28] <Herby_> thats great

[22:28] <AlexDaniel> 6x as fast to be more precise :)
