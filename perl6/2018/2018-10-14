[02:35] <Zoffix> candr: reading the speculations ( http://design.perl6.org/S26.html#Declarator_blocks ), those blocks are part of Pod and their rendering is implementation-dependent and can be affected by configuration. However, I'm not seeing any configuration handling options in the source (at least for Pod::To::Text) ( https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/lib/Pod/To/Text.pm6#L84-L109 ) so sounds like there's

[02:35] <Zoffix> currently no good way to hide them. I'm also noticing another bug with those in that they're reported as `class` rather than argument or something.

[02:47] <rouking> Hmmm

[02:48] <rouking> is it theoretically possible to just combine MoarVM and the bytecode, or does the compiler have to be there? I know it would for something like eval

[02:48] <rouking> but eval is really unnecessary

[02:56] <b2gills> There are currently limitations with the compiler that make that sort of thing difficult. One being that it isn'

[03:25] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: No. I finally got what you meant.

[03:25] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: but should that work?

[03:31] <Xliff> Two minds on the subject. One: It should work since the object can perform the method. Two: It shouldn't not work since, even though the object can do the method, it was not implemented by the object.

[03:32] <Xliff> Tricky. And I'm afraid I won't be of much further help.

[13:52] <bichu> infact centos/fedora is no more there in aws.

[13:52] <bichu> so we should add support for suse also in rakudo site, right?

[13:52] <timotimo> one of our devs is involved with suse if i'm not mistaken, so there's official packages

[13:53] <bichu> i mean, there is no documentation for installing dev packages

[13:53] <timotimo> oh

[13:53] <bichu> https://rakudo.org/files/star/source - on this page, I dont find SUSE instructions

[13:54] <bichu> SUSE is coming up very well with SAP moving their platform from RedHat to SUSE

[14:00] <timotimo> bichu: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/blob/master/templates/_from-source-prereqs.html.ep - would you like to file a pull-request?

[14:00] <holyghost> s/cng listompiler maili/compiler mailing list

[14:01] <holyghost> I need a name for Bayesian learning and so on

[14:03] <bichu> timotimo: i am new to this. what area i have to copy paste and just change the instructions alone?

[14:04] <timotimo> depends on whether we want to have it inside the same card that has redhat/centos/fedora or as a card of its own

[14:04] <bichu> it has to be a card of its own

[14:05] <bichu> suse instructions are different

[14:05] <bichu> suse normally doesnt follow yum

[14:05] <bichu> it uses zypper on command line

[14:05] <timotimo> right, zypper

[14:06] <timotimo> is Basis-Devel really all that's needed? does it also contain libssl headers?

[14:06] <timotimo> also, git

[14:06] <bichu> no

[14:07] <timotimo> is it still called "SuSE"?

[14:07] <bichu> git seems to be in by default

[14:07] <bichu> it was. not it is SUSE

[14:07] <bichu> all cas

[14:07] <bichu> caps*

[14:07] <bichu> timotimo - what is this - sudo yum install perl-ExtUtils-Command?

[14:07] <bichu> what is this used for?

[14:08] <timotimo> it's used in Configure.pl

[14:08] <timotimo> well, not necessarily directly

[14:08] <bichu> ok, in AWS, the memory is not enough

[14:08] <bichu> i will have to try for a local install

[14:09] <timotimo> ah, right, the ~1.5 gigs

[14:09] <bichu> i mean for the free tier

[14:09] <timotimo> if you run it with the env var MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=yes it could use a few megs less

[14:09] <timotimo> maybe not enough, though

[14:09] <timotimo> i've started the edit for the suse page

[14:09] <bichu> yeah

[14:10] <timotimo> can you give me all lines that you need?

[14:10] <bichu> also, to RedHat/CentOS/Fedora you might want to add Amazon as well

[14:10] <bichu> i believe it should be the same specs as RedHat

[14:11] <bichu> cant wait for ready made packages to be available for all OS. Perl6 will rule!! :)

[14:31] <candr> Is it normal or expected that Pod shows nothing of the return type of a sub? It does show typed parameters.... https://pastebin.com/c7jRQFNJ

[14:34] <lizmat> candr: I would assume that's an omission

[14:34] <candr> lizmat: intentional or overlooked?

[14:35] <lizmat> overlooked, I would say

[14:35] <candr> ok

[14:41] <candr> I'll put in a github issue

[15:17] <pmurias> how can I EVAL something with a fresh set of GLOBALs

[15:17] <pmurias> ?

[15:18] <pmurias> 'class Foo {}' does work when run twice in 6pad because the class is already declared the second time

[15:20] <holyghost> Cannot you overload the file or method ?

[18:01] <ryn1x> Found the categories on the docs were reverted because of an issue here: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2374 . Unclear if it has been resolved since the issue is closed but the categories are still disabled. Hope they come back... I use the docs at work a lot and the categories were nice.
