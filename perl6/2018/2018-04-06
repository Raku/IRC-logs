[00:24] <dominix> hi there

[00:25] <dominix> I have a simple line that I can not display completely

[00:25] <dominix> (1..2500).hyper.grep( *.is-prime ).perl

[00:25] <dominix> is says :"HyperSeq.new(configuration => HyperConfiguration.new(batch => 64, degree => 4))"

[00:25] *** mcmillhj left
[00:26] <dominix> if I just "(1..2500).grep( *.is-prime ).hyper.say" 

[00:26] <dominix> I just heve the x first primers, but I want the complete list

[00:27] <dominix> so I have a 2 problems: 1 where to place the .hyper ? 2: how do I display the complete list ?

[00:28] *** aindilis left
[00:28] *** pharv left
[00:30] <geekosaur> dominix, say uses .gist, which truncates. try: (1..2500).grep( *.is-prime ).hyper.eager.perl.say

[00:30] <geekosaur> the .eager makes it run the hyper instead of just giving you the unevaluated one back

[00:30] <geekosaur> and explicit .perl avoids the truncation by .gist

[00:31] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:31] <dominix> nice

[00:31] <dominix> thanks geekosaur

[00:51] <dominix> is there a rule or a trick that makes me understand where to place .hyper method calll ?$*

[00:52] <dominix> my keyboard is on strike, sorry (he's french)

[00:57] <geekosaur> wherever it's likely to help? generally it's for when you can do processing in parallel; you probably want it to be something worth parallelizing, but that's not something that is readily automated

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: next

[00:57] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in ‚âà9 hours (2018-04-07 UTC-12‚åÅUTC+14). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[00:59] <Zoffix> dominix: .hyper creates a HyperSequence out of regular sequence, which will cause many other operations you tack onto it be processed on multiple threads. To collapse it back to non-paralell, just call .list or .Seq on it. I guess we still need to document the semantics of HyperSeq and RaceSeq, but you can see some of them in this spreadsheet that was used during development:

[00:59] <Zoffix> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kpSb8LoskHSbM1FQvWdQ269rlRkU8vh5A_ElpN3Qay4/edit#gid=0  So that would give you a picture of what operations on a HyperSeq do what (some of them collapse it to non-parallel one)

[01:02] <Zoffix> Filed as D#1897 unsure if that stuff was already discussed somewhere

[01:02] <synopsebot> D#1897 [open]: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1897 [docs] Semantics of HyperSeq/RaceSeq appear to be undocumented

[01:03] *** mcmillhj joined
[01:04] <Zoffix> dominix: so `(1..2500).hyper.grep( *.is-prime ).perl` will cause that .grep to be executed in parallel, while `(1..2500).grep( *.is-prime ).hyper.say` won't because hyper is *after* the greppage. You can think of it as a pipeline (it doesn't have to be a single method call chain, you can break it up into variables; the pipeline is maintained via iterators). And the place where you stick the hyper will cause

[01:04] <Zoffix> all the other stuff later in the pipeline to be hypered (according to the semantics in that spreadsheet; some stuff will unhyper it)

[16:29] <interestedinperl> Is perl 6 "homoiconic"?

[16:29] <timotimo> i don't think it is, no

[16:30] <interestedinperl> But is is "reflective"?

[16:30] *** ChoHag joined
[16:30] <skids> Not homoiconic, but you can play with AST from within the language.

[16:31] <skids> We call reflection introspection but yes.

[16:31] <interestedinperl> Ok. I found the example with `eval` in this article pretty astonshingL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)

[16:32] <interestedinperl> The example is under Perl, but I'm guessing Perl 6 has the same.

[16:33] *** mwhisenhunt left
[16:33] <skids> No pretty different.

[16:33] *** pharv left
[16:34] <skids> I'm failing to see how that Perl5 example is "reflection"

[16:34] *** mcmillhj left
[16:35] <interestedinperl> How would `eval "new Foo->hello;"` in the example be coded under Perl 6?

[16:36] <timotimo> depends on how you have access to Foo

[16:36] <skids> We have EVAL, but as a general purpose tool its use is discouraged.

[16:36] <timotimo> and which parts are dynamic and which are known when typing the code

[16:37] <timotimo> i.e. you could go full dynamic with my $classname = "Foo"; my $constructormethod = "new"; my $to-invoke = "hello"; ::($classname)."$constructormethod"()."$to-invoke"()

[16:38] *** pierre_ joined
[16:38] <interestedinperl> Very neat.

[16:39] <timotimo> ::($foo) is lookup in the lexical environment, you might also have the type object in $myclass

[16:42] *** pierre_ left
[16:44] <interestedinperl> I'm looking to translate a simple, but computationally intensive application written in the proprietary Wolfram Language‚Ñ¢. The Wolfram proprietary scheme makes it difficult for me to package my source code as an app and share it with others, free of cost. My source code makes a lot of use of peculiar coding features that are difficult to implement with C/C++. So I've been looking into several different options. Julia and P

[16:44] <timotimo> irc cut the message off after "Julia and P"

[16:44] <interestedinperl> ...erl 6 being prominent among them.

[16:45] <timotimo> cool :)

[16:46] <skids> When you start using metaprogramming constructs, your code is likely to end up somewhat less efficient at runtime, so... is it computationally intensive in addition to or because of that? :-)

[16:46] <interestedinperl> In addition to!

[16:46] <interestedinperl> My program calculates the combinations and permutations of a multiset in real-time from user input.

[16:47] <interestedinperl> Fro example, how many combinations and permutations can you obtain from drawing 5 colored candy from a bag containing 20 blue, 3 red, 7 brown, infinite yellow, etc.

[16:49] <skids> m: print bag(1,1,2,3).combinations # We've got some basic combinatorics already.

[16:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar c8364d696: OUTPUT: ¬´ 1      2 3     1 2     1 1     2 3     1 1     2 2     1 3     1 2     1 1     2 3     1 2     1¬ª

[16:49] <skids> Also, there is someone currently very interested in such things IIRC...

[16:50] <interestedinperl> A user can drag a slider for his "random selection" and see the output evaluated in real-time. The output is numeric, but... there is an option to have it all visualized too. This one option I can dispense with in my code translation, lol. 

[16:50] <timotimo> we don'thave code for infinite of one kind in a bag

[16:51] <Bowlslaw> does anyone know of a better way to copy a csv file into a SQLite database than insert statements for every line? I know about the .import command, but I'd rather do it automatically with my program

[16:51] <interestedinperl> timotimo, that's ok. ill be delighted to define my functions for that.

[16:52] <timotimo> Bowlslaw: well, you can invoke the sqlite commandline program with Proc::Async and ask it to import for you

[16:53] <interestedinperl> https://scontent.fbed1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29597493_2077249715845319_644054251072012922_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=fba76aff6d494c98acd6f55db3058c0a&oe=5B342BED

[16:53] <timotimo> but otherwise i'd recommend Text::CSV, it's thorough and good

[16:53] <Ulti> yeah the .import command in SQLite is the most efficient way to get data in too

[16:53] <skids> interestedinperl: http://www.0racle.info/ is a blog from someone currently getting elbow deep in our combinatorics iterators.

[16:54] <Ulti> equivalent to the copy from file in postgres

[16:54] <Bowlslaw> timotimo: ahhh, cool, thanks

[18:24] <moritz> speaking of DWIM

[18:24] <moritz> if you only need every 4th element of an array, not the index, you can do something like

[18:25] <moritz> my @a = 'a'..'z'; say @a[0, 4 ... *]

[18:25] <evalable6> moritz, rakudo-moar fbdffc1cd: OUTPUT: ¬´(a e i m q u y)‚ê§¬ª

[18:28] <[Coke]> I think the nbsp is for Perl itself, never seen it applied to the pod.

[18:30] <Bowlslaw> omg

[18:30] <[Coke]> not that neither "pod 6" nor "pod6" appear anywhere in http://design.perl6.org/S26.html; it's referred to there as "Perl 6 Pod". My personal recommendation would be POD6, but IANL

[18:31] <Bowlslaw> moritz: so if I have an array of hashes, I can do - say @[0, 4 ... *]<Date>

[18:34] <moritz> Bowlslaw: no, because @a[...] returns a list, not a hash

[18:35] <Bowlslaw> :O

[18:35] <tobs> but you can >>.<Date> on that list

[19:12] <Bowlslaw> the Proc::Async documentation is somewhat confusing...

[19:12] <Bowlslaw> thought it could be because I don't have the requisite knowledge

[19:15] <AlexDaniel> Bowlslaw: if you say that it is confusing, then it probably is

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> Bowlslaw: consider filing a doc issue here https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> Bowlslaw: with your ideas on how to make it less confusing :)

[19:16] <moritz> Bowlslaw: it assumes basic familiarity with promises and supplies/react/whenever

[19:18] *** rindolf joined

[21:32] <Zoffix> I still don't fully get when code objects need clonning. In `loop { FIRST Nil }` the block get shoved into the var and just called without a clone, but in `sub { loop { FIRST Nil } }` we make `Seq.from-loop` and give the block to it as an arg, and there we clone. So why is it needed in one place but not in the other? Is it cause in the arg case it'll be executed in some scope other than the current one?

[21:52] <Zoffix> Actually, why is Seq.from-loop made in the first place in that case :/

[21:52] *** pharv left
[21:53] <Zoffix> Oh, we don't in that case, but we do in sub { loop { FIRST Nil; LAST Nil } } :S
