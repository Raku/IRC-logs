[05:23] <Herby_> can i have a pm6 module called 'minigrep', and inside that module have a function called 'minigrep'?

[05:24] <Herby_> when i try, i get an error "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: uninstantiable, minigrep)

[05:31] <Herby_> trying my hand at this Rust project, using p6. stumbling out the gate on getting a basic module together

[05:42] *** molaf left
[05:46] <geekosaur> I think "minigrep" is a recent(?) addition to the setting… that's not supposed to leak.

[05:47] <geekosaur> in any case, REPR: uninstantiable is almost always an internal error of some kind, unless you're playing games with indirect invocation; file a bug

[05:53] <Herby_> geekosaur: thanks, definitely not intentionally playing any games

[05:53] <Herby_> i'm a novice with github and bugs. what repo should i submit this to?

[05:53] <Herby_> and very likely its not a bug, i'm likely stepping on my toes somewhere

[05:53] <geekosaur> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues

[05:54] <geekosaur> no, if you're getting "REPR: uninstantiable", either you've done &{expression producing nonsense} or there's a compiler or setting bug

[05:56] <Herby_> ok i'll get a bug submitted, thanks

[05:56] <geekosaur> in fact I thik uninstantiable there implies an nqp type

[05:56] <geekosaur> which is a "shouldn't happen" unless you're poking nqp

[05:57] <Herby_> basically I had:  lib/minigrep.pm6: unit module minigrep; sub minigrep() {put "test"} is export

[05:58] <Herby_> then bin/main: use minigrep; sub MAIN($a, $b) { minigrep(); }

[05:58] <geekosaur> right, that should never produce that

[05:58] <Herby_> k

[05:58] <geekosaur> so you collided with an internal name that it's not supposed to be possible to collide with

[17:32] <pmurias> MasterDuke: the biggest difference would be it uses 2 spaces of indentation

[17:52] <notable6> tyil, Noted!

[17:55] <pmurias> leont: what languages are complex enough that they can't?

[17:55] <leont> I doubt a formatter would do a good job of perl6

[17:56] <leont> In my experience, clang-format can't handle C++ all that well either (unless you stay away from features like closures)

[17:56] <leont> Actually, I think closures is where it usually goes wrong

[17:57] <pmurias> leont: I hope Perl 6 ends up with a good format

[17:57] <leont> Mainly because IME you often can't judge how something should be folded by simple rules as "always on a new line" or "always on the same line"

[17:58] <pmurias> perltidy works well in Perl 6

[19:01] *** tobh16 joined
[19:01] *** tobh16 left
[19:01] <Any14Coffee> Hey, wondering if I can ask a silly question? Just breaking my gums in Perl and little stuck

[19:02] <timotimo> should be fine

[19:02] <timotimo> if it's about perl 5, though, we may tell you where to ask instead :)

[19:02] <timotimo> this is the channel about perl 6 in particular

[19:03] <Any14Coffee> So I'm using a regex to match the output of a ping on Linux and recording the min,avg and max response times 

[19:03] <Any14Coffee> However there is a part of a code I'm using I'm struggling to understand

[19:03] <Any14Coffee> Looks like this

[19:03] <timotimo> oh

[19:03] <timotimo> hold on a second

[19:04] <timotimo> IRC is very bad at pasting large chunks of text or code

[19:04] <timotimo> may i ask you to use some manner of pasting site, like nopaste or gist on github or whatever you find, really

[19:04] <Any14Coffee> I don't need all the code just like 10 chars 

[19:04] <timotimo> oh, 10 chars is fine, 10 lines would be bad :)

[19:04] <timotimo> go ahead, then

[19:04] <Any14Coffee> Haha oh yeah!

[19:05] <Any14Coffee> If ($data[10] =~ 

[19:05] <El_Che> that looks like perl 5

[19:05] *** psychoslave joined
[19:05] <Any14Coffee> What is the bit in square brackets doing?

[19:05] <timotimo> that's fine enough to answer

[19:05] <El_Che> Any14Coffee: it's an index of the array

[19:06] <lizmat> the eleventh element of array @data

[19:06] <timotimo> yeah, you'd have multiple entries in @data, and $data[10] will give you the 11th entry (the first one is numbered 0)

[19:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v psychoslave

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> .tell jmerelo yeah, thanks for poking me. It's going to be an opt-in thingie, so module authors who are interested should set up a hook. I was planning to wait for hacktoberfest news first before setting it up, but there's no info yet. I'll check back tomorrow or in two days or so.

[19:06] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> I guess those participating in this squashathon will receive both a T-shirt from digitalocean and a plush camelia from lizmat

[19:07] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: I thought only the winner ?

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> oh yes, the winner I mean

[19:07] <Any14Coffee> Ah ok, that makes sense and I'd read about them just wasnt sure, thank you  

[19:07] <lizmat> *phew*

[19:08] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: picking the wrong words lately… thanks for correcting :)

[19:08] <AlexDaniel> though digitalocean sends a t-shirt to almost everyone, as long as you have at least 3 PRs I think?

[19:08] <El_Che> so, If I understand correctly, everyone that joins the channel will get a butterfly with a personalized note from liz?

[19:08] <El_Che> :)

[19:09] <lizmat> eh, no ?

[19:09] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: he's joking :)

[19:09] <lizmat> I know

[19:09] <lizmat> and I know who's making the joke  :-)

[19:13] <cheese_cake__> hello

[19:14] <cheese_cake__> im new to Perl 6 and IRC

[19:15] <lizmat> cheese_cake__: hello, welcome!

[19:15] <El_Che> Double welcome!

[19:15] <cheese_cake__> hi :)

[19:15] <cheese_cake__> i was directed here from the perl6 subreddit

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> nice

[19:17] <cheese_cake__> i've written a hello world program in perl 6 but that's about it so far

[19:18] <El_Che> cheese_cake__: it's a fun journey

[19:19] <timotimo> o/

[19:20] *** MasterDuke left
[19:21] <cheese_cake__> so it seems, unfortunately I can't seem to find much information on it. All of my results are for perl 5. 

[19:21] *** lichtkind left
[19:21] *** erana_ left
[19:22] *** erana_ joined
[19:22] <El_Che> cheese_cake__: that's true. The naming results in "Google trouble". In the beginning, though, doc.perl6.org is your friend

[19:22] <cheese_cake__> great

[19:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v erana_

[19:23] <cheese_cake__> im trying to use something like python's input() function in perl 6, i've found slurp, but i'd like it to wait for the user to press enter, then return a value

[19:23] <cheese_cake__> maybe that's just not how perl 6 works though

[19:23] <timotimo> you'll be interested in "prompt", then

[19:23] <El_Che> "prompt"

[19:24] <timotimo> slurp will slurp up all input that is available

[19:24] <timotimo> so to finish it up you'd have to ctrl-d or otherwise EOF the input stream

[19:25] <cheese_cake__> is there a function  in the standard library to stop reading at a \n?

[19:25] <El_Che> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/prompt

[19:25] <timotimo> get will do that, too

[19:25] <timotimo> prompt is pretty much "output what you pass, then get()"

[19:26] <cheese_cake__> i see

[19:26] <cheese_cake__> thanks!

[19:26] <cheese_cake__> oh, and the docs said that the difference between say and put is one calls gist on the string, what does that actaully do. I read the gist doc page and couldnt figure out what it meant

[19:27] <El_Che> cheese_cake__: there are repl bots in this channel, when you need some feedback

[19:27] <El_Che> m: say 'Hello world!'

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3ba449fa: OUTPUT: «Hello world!␤»

[19:27] <timotimo> the difference is not for strings, but for bigger things

[19:27] <timotimo> if you have a big list, gist will only print the first few entries

[19:27] <cheese_cake__> m: my thing = "hi"; put $thing;

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3ba449fa: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed my (did you mean to declare a sigilless \thing or $thing?)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my thing7⏏5 = "hi"; put $thing;␤»

[19:36] <El_Che> cheese_cake__: in perl 6 by zoffix

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-banbot

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> cheese_cake__: actually, it seems to be indexed already

[19:38] *** cheese_cake__ left
[19:38] <AlexDaniel> cheese_cake__: if you type “input” into the search field on https://docs.perl6.org/ it already says “input (Python)”

[19:38] *** cheese_cake__ joined
[19:38] <AlexDaniel> which links to `prompt` :)

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> I was about to create a ticket for that but I'm glad somebody did it already

[19:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cheese_cake__

[19:39] <cheese_cake__> how similar is perl to perl 6

[19:41] <El_Che> cheese_cake__: difficult question. Way bigger difference than between python 2 and 3. Less than between say C and Go

[19:41] *** psychoslave left
[19:41] <El_Che> I see it more as a cleanup up syntax and a big modern standard library

[19:42] <El_Che> ^-- that is of course just an opinion.

[19:42] <El_Che> there are some people around with a less subjective take :)

[19:43] <cheese_cake__> i see :)

[19:43] <cheese_cake__> are there any good small web frameworks for perl 6? I've only seen mojolicious but i'd rather not delve into the perl5 in perl6 realm just yet

[19:43] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: it's more of a sequel and not a new version, so it feels like kind of the same thing but everything is a bit different

[19:43] <El_Che> mojo is very nice indeed. In perl 6 we have Cro

[19:44] <El_Che> https://cro.services/

[19:44] <cheese_cake__> does anyone have any experience with this https://github.com/Bailador/Bailador

[19:45] *** leepa joined
[19:45] <cheese_cake__> i found it looked interesting

[19:45] *** leepa left
[19:50] <cheese_cake__> and what is the logic being using eq instead of == for string comparison?

[19:52] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: so that different operators are used for string and numeric comparisons

[19:52] *** robertle left
[19:52] <lizmat> m: say "foo" == 42

[19:54] *** mmattice1 joined
[19:54] *** mmattice1 left
[19:56] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: there is in general a distinction between numeric and string operators

[19:56] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: that allows coercion to dwim more while it being more clear what is happening

[19:57] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: other example a ~ operator does string concatenation while + does numeric addition

[19:59] *** Any14Coffee left
[20:00] <ufobat> cheese_cake__, me :p

[20:01] <ufobat> cheese_cake__, do you know cro?

[20:07] <cheese_cake__> nope

[20:08] <cheese_cake__> ufobat, i dont even know perl 6

[20:11] <ufobat> bailador is more perl5'ish, if youd like to say so. its more like dancer/mojo, whereas cro is a more modern aproach

[20:14] *** rfold left
[20:14] <cheese_cake__> what do you mean by perl5ish?

[20:19] <pmurias> cheese_cake__: it's a more direct port of a Perl 5 module

[20:50] <xinming> How do we return an Empty list?

[20:52] <xinming> m: dd (().Slip);

[20:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3ba449fa: OUTPUT: «slip()␤»

[20:52] <xinming> 'Empty' makes me confusing.

[20:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3ba449fa: OUTPUT: «(1, 2, 3, (), 4, 5, 6)␤»

[20:53] <xinming> I understand that.

[21:06] <geekosaur> in p5, parens woudl be an error and {} was used basically as a parser hack

[21:06] <xinming> Ok

[21:06] <xinming> SO, %() and %{} are the same in perl6.

[21:06] <geekosaur> and at one point %{} in rakudo used to getyou a "this isn't perl 5" whine

[21:06] <xinming> but now, it doesn't. :-)

[21:07] <geekosaur> yes, there's beena move away from such

[21:09] *** Zoffix joined
[21:09] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[21:10] <Zoffix> xinming: %(:a) constructs a hash. %{} constructs a hash and then uses the .hash coercer on it. Because the latter is a curly, it's affected by the caveats that make it a block instead of a hash

[21:10] <Zoffix> m: (%(:a($_))).perl.say; (%{:a($_)}).perl.say;

[21:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar d3ba449fa: OUTPUT: «{:a(Any)}␤Odd number of elements found where hash initializer expected:␤Only saw: -> ;; $_? is raw { #`(Block|60298792) ... }␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:10] <Zoffix> (while the %() ain't affected)

[21:12] <Zoffix> xinming: for forcing, just use %() instead of {}

[22:52] <cheese_cake__> does anybody know if there is a library to register a program as a URI scheme handler on different platforms?

[23:00] *** ufobat left
[23:02] <cheese_cake__> and perl6 is compiled, right? If so, is it possible to create byte/native code for distribution?

[23:03] <timotimo> cheese_cake__: we don't have something convenient yet. for windows there's a module that will build an installer, but it'll just install a complete perl6 + application in a specific folder

[23:03] <timotimo> i'm not aware of something that creates, like, .desktop files and such

[23:35] <cheese_cake__> how can i read command line arguments? I know this should be simple but I cant find it on the docs

[23:37] <tobs> cheese_cake__: there is a command-line args parser built into MAIN using signatures, see https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#sub_MAIN

[23:42] <cheese_cake__> now that is nifty

[23:43] <timotimo> it's extremely good, indeed

[23:43] <cheese_cake__> does anyoen know if this is the right format for a .desktop file to set myneatprogram:thing urls to launch my program? MimeType=x-scheme-handler/myneatprogram; 

[23:43] <timotimo> cheese_cake__: do you happen to remember what exactly you searched for so maybe we can make it easier to find?

[23:44] <cheese_cake__> 'perl6 read args', 'perl6 arg parser'

[23:45] <timotimo> perhaps the python-to-perl6 document ought to be findable with "argparse" and "parse args"

[23:45] <timotimo> and "optparse", too

[23:46] <cheese_cake__> yes, i looked at that, ctrl-f arg didnt bring up any results 

[23:46] <timotimo> aye

[23:46] <timotimo> it's not in there at the moment

[23:47] <cheese_cake__> yeah, that would be useful

[23:47] <cheese_cake__> are you a linux user?

[23:47] <timotimo> i am

[23:47] <timotimo> are you perhaps interested in contributing that little bit to the docs? :)

[23:47] <cheese_cake__> i'd love to!

[23:48] <timotimo> way cool

[23:48] <cheese_cake__> is there a github or some other git hosting platform you're using?

[23:48] <timotimo> the docs page at the very bottom has the links

[23:48] <cheese_cake__> ahh i see

[23:49] <cheese_cake__> what is the HTML built from?

[23:49] <timotimo> it's pod6, a partial rethink of perl's "plain old documentation" format

[23:50] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/doc/Language/py-nutshell.pod6

[23:51] <timotimo> it should be fine to just cargocult the syntax and when you make the github pull request, travis-ci should build it for you and explode if there's something wrong

[23:51] <timotimo> and then (or earlier) you can just ask for advice, too :)

[23:51] <cheese_cake__> thanks :)

[23:51] <timotimo> \o/

[23:51] <cheese_cake__> forking it 

[23:53] <cheese_cake__> what desktop or window manager do you use if you dont mind me asking? I've been stuck on xfce for ages, dont know what people use now

[23:54] <timotimo> hah, i'm on xfce4 as well

[23:54] <timotimo> i was on plasma for a bit in between, but something annoyed me about it

[23:54] <timotimo> i went through many phases

[23:55] <cheese_cake__> plasma is a bit like gnome except I find it unpleasant to use

[23:55] <cheese_cake__> it feels like windows 8 trying to be linux-y

[23:55] <timotimo> surely everyone has had or will have a "tiling window manager" phase or two in their life

[23:55] <timotimo> i had at least dwm, xmonad, and i3

[23:55] <cheese_cake__> haha yeah I used i3-gaps for a couple months

[23:55] <AlexDaniel> oh please not the second one

[23:55] <AlexDaniel> I still haven't learned to use i3 properly

[23:55] <cheese_cake__> i3 isnt that hard?

[23:56] <timotimo> you're not a fan of xmonad, eh?

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> well yes except that I don't use tabs, or containers, or anything

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> all I know is “move this thing to the right” and “move this thing to the bottom”

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> and with that I can create any configuration, really :)

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> except when I need to move the whole workspace to another window, or something like that

[23:57] <timotimo> all that matters is that you find it pleasant and comfortable to use

[23:57] <AlexDaniel> that's when you have to do finger noodles and hit a hundred of keys at the same time because… no this shortcut renames the workspace, no this one does something else…

[23:57] <cheese_cake__> I liked i3 a lot, but i went back to xfce just cause I could bind a lot of the same stuff, but I could mess with it really quickly, no need for rewriting my 200 line config

[23:58] <cheese_cake__> zef is taking quite a while to install these deps

[23:58] <Esca> i use xfce for misc settings, panel and convenience but swapped xfwm for i3

[23:58] <timotimo> just recently i read a little blog post about using xfce with i3

[23:58] <cheese_cake__> how does that work?

[23:58] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: definitely more comfortable than non-tiling, but it'd better start reading my mind…

[23:59] <timotimo> mostly just "don't use xfce-desktop or xfwm"

[23:59] <AlexDaniel> cheese_cake__: oh yeah we're working on making zef faster

[23:59] <cheese_cake__> great

[23:59] <cheese_cake__> how many dependencies can the docs have??
