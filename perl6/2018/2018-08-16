[00:01] <vrurg_> timotimo: but no slurpy?

[00:01] <vrurg_> m: my $c = -> $v, *%h { say "$v with ", %h }; $c( pi, a=>1, b=>2);

[00:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 927945dac: OUTPUT: ¬´3.141592653589793 with {a => 1, b => 2}‚ê§¬ª

[00:02] * vrurg_ is confused... 

[00:02] <vrurg_> Fails when calling a method with Capture.

[00:02] *** JJJ000 left
[00:03] <timotimo> slurpy also works

[00:03] <timotimo> can you show more closely how you're doing it, and what the error is?

[00:04] *** Ven` left
[00:04] <vrurg_> timotimo: a bit too complex to extract the essence. Gonna try figure it out. Basically, it ends with something like: instance.$method(|(@invoke-params.Capture)); 

[00:05] <vrurg_> instance is a class instance. params could be a mixture of positional and named ones.

[00:06] <timotimo> OK, can you perhaps print the result of @invoke-params.Capture? i suppose it should just be the same as what Array.Capture would do?

[00:08] <vrurg_> Just working on it. ;) Test takes a bit to complete.

[00:08] <timotimo> OK!

[00:08] <vrurg_> \(:attribute("\$!bar"))

[00:08] <vrurg_> The block is defined like this: has $.bar is mooish(:lazy, :builder(-> $s, *%h {"block builder"}));

[00:08] *** DarthGandalf left
[00:09] <vrurg_> Block signature is reported as ($). So, I get: Unexpected named argument 'attribute' passed

[00:10] <timotimo> oh? that doesn't seem right :)

[00:10] * vrurg_ absolutely agrees.

[00:10] <vrurg_> Hope it's not right with my code.

[00:11] <timotimo> can you somehow output bar's builder block as early as possible to see if it changes for some reason?

[00:12] *** jlf23 joined
[00:12] <vrurg_> timotimo: working on it. Use of same attribute name all across a test suite makes it somewhat tricky to catch the right one. ;)

[00:14] <vrurg_> It's definitely lost somewhere as trait_mod gets the right signature. Ok, I'll trace it down to the moment where it's lost first.

[00:24] <vrurg_> My fault, same error from another location. No signature was harmed while filimg this code...

[00:25] <timotimo> ah, OK

[00:25] <vrurg_> filming

[00:25] <timotimo> yeah, it's sometimes hard to figure out what got called when you get an error about signatures

[00:25] <timotimo> sometimes --ll-exception helps, but not always

[03:43] <MasterDuke> SmokeMachine: i've never used an ORM, so i don't really know how to evaluate it, but you might want to ask lizmat to mention it in the weekly, especially if you're looking for comments

[03:47] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: you can even weekly: it

[03:48] <SmokeMachine> MasterDuke: that‚Äôs a good idea!

[03:50] <benjikun> what's the command to add stuff to the list for weeklies

[03:50] <benjikun> is it weekly:

[03:51] <benjikun> or am I imagining that this is a thing

[03:51] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: wouldn‚Äôt that be a little too invasive?

[03:52] <benjikun> I don't think it would be

[03:52] <benjikun> start a thread on /r/perl6 maybe for it

[03:52] <AlexDaniel> benjikun: it's a thing

[03:52] <benjikun> phew that's what i thought

[03:52] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: not at all, especially if you yourself write some text for liz to include :)

[06:46] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: I am not a heavy user, but like someone on the reddit thread recommended, I would suggest looking at other APIs. I like this one: http://gorm.io/docs/models.html

[06:46] <benjikun> Yeah that's probably a good idea

[06:47] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: I like it because it makes my usecase very simple. It matches tables to datatypes (structs) and the querying is very similar to regular SQL.

[06:47] <El_Che> those 2 things pretty much cover all of my ORM usage :)

[12:39] <Altreus> it says pod6 must begin with =begin pod

[12:39] <Altreus> Is this actually true or can I start with =head2 like perl5?

[12:39] <Altreus> cos that was very useful

[12:40] <Altreus> It made inline documentation 3 lines long rather than 5

[12:40] <tadzik> where does it say that?

[12:40] <tadzik> cos it's wrong :)

[12:40] <Altreus> https://docs.perl6.org/language/pod

[12:40] <tadzik> =begin starts a pod block, that must end in an =end

[12:41] <Altreus> right but I can't do =head2 whatever\n\ndescription\n\n=end pod

[12:41] <tadzik> nope

[12:41] <Altreus> ah

[12:41] <tadzik> but you may like paragraph blocks

[12:41] <araraloren> The compile hang on with above code ^^

[12:41] <tadzik> they end with a blank line

[12:42] <Altreus> This says they end with the next block command

[12:42] <Altreus> oh my mistake

[12:42] <Altreus> I stopped reading

[12:43] <Altreus> Although the POD6 is shorter, it seems less clean: https://gist.github.com/Altreus/77e9f5d737ef9845e6c3aa3e8ac235a1

[12:44] <Altreus> ah drat, now I need new vim folding rules

[12:44] <Altreus> ;_;

[12:45] <tadzik> Altreus: do a =for head2\nThis is how you might describe a method called pod6\n\n

[12:45] <tadzik> should be equivalent

[12:45] <tadzik> or even =head2 This is how you might describe a method called pod6\n

[12:45] <Altreus> well then you lose =head2 pod6

[12:46] <tadzik> oh right

[12:46] <tadzik> hm

[12:46] <Altreus> can't do a quick header-with-paragraph without begin & end

[12:46] <Altreus> which is fine

[12:46] <tadzik> true

[12:46] <Altreus> most of the time I look for my vim folds anyway :)

[12:46] <Altreus> ah!

[12:46] <Altreus> but in perl5, my vim fold says -- =head2 pod5

[12:46] <Altreus> in perl6 it's always going to say -- =begin pod

[12:47] <Altreus> Anyway I already extended POD5 to make it good :P

[12:47] <Altreus> It didn't need fixing again

[12:47] <Altreus> someone should have asked :D

[12:48] <tadzik> Altreus: https://gist.github.com/tadzik/9655a59cf657636695237ef5066b8266 :)

[12:48] <Altreus> golly

[12:48] <Altreus> a) wat

[12:48] <Altreus> b) does it work for properties too

[12:48] <tadzik> should work for everything

[12:48] <Altreus> I just found declarator blocks

[12:48] <Altreus> I can dig it

[12:48] <tadzik> including function arguments

[12:49] <tadzik> kind of works for function arguments, though not in the way I expected the output to look

[12:50] <araraloren> I don't like that POD* 

[12:50] <araraloren> I prefer AsciiDOC or MarkDown

[12:50] <Altreus> This format, however, will not translate to a multi-line display by perl6 -doc.

[12:50] <Altreus> :(

[12:50] <tadzik> oh? Hm

[12:51] <Altreus> araraloren: actually I went to the effort of extending POD5 precisely because I didn't like markdown

[12:51] <Altreus> It didn't suit blog posts, which seemed silly

[12:51] <araraloren> oh, so I like AsciiDoc much than markdown

[12:51] <Altreus> never tried asciidoc :)

[12:51] <Altreus> unless that's the Java one with /**

[13:22] <timotimo> hm, are you sure it's the sprintf that does it, and not for example stringifying $type or $name, or calling self.perl?

[13:22] <timotimo> hm, the arguments passed to match aren't complex

[13:22] <timotimo> so it wouldn't be that

[13:22] <araraloren> yeah, I am not sure, but without the line or with correctly format string, it is fine

[13:23] <timotimo> what's wrong about the format string, just not enough arguments?

[13:23] *** sotona left
[13:23] <timotimo> it could very well be that it throws an exception and the matchByName and matchByExt taps just don't do any error handling at all

[13:23] <timotimo> so the pipelines just get stuck perhaps?

[13:24] <araraloren> no, it missing %s in the format string

[13:24] <araraloren> without the line, it can print something

[13:26] <timotimo> perhaps it's vulnerable to timing differences

[13:26] <araraloren> that's another problme of the script

[13:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v w_richard_w

[13:26] <araraloren> timing difference ?

[13:26] <timotimo> yeah, a race condition perhaps

[13:27] <araraloren> The code is running in different thread ?

[13:27] <araraloren> the react block and the other code ?

[13:27] <timotimo> hm, not really

[13:28] <araraloren> I thought they were in one thread :/

[13:28] <timotimo> also, i don't think the "return" inside your matchBy functions will work right

[13:29] <araraloren> hmm, so they can't do what coroutine do ?

[13:29] <timotimo> how about sprinkling some CATCH { .say } in your code?

[13:29] <timotimo> oh, the reason is just that you're using a pointy block there

[13:29] <timotimo> and pointy blocks are transparent to "return"

[13:29] <timotimo> you can just turn it into an anonymous sub

[13:30] <araraloren> oh

[13:30] <araraloren> I got your mean

[13:31] <araraloren> timotimo cool

[13:31] <araraloren> that's solve the script hang on trouble

[13:57] <Tison> Recently I got thoughts like this, even Rakudo Perl 6 has announced production ready so we would no change so basic concepts, but I still wonder how important '@' and '%' "as a sigil"

[13:58] <yoleaux> b2gills: I'll pass your message to scimon.

[14:19] <Altreus> why does p6doc try to compile the code? Could not find API::Discord::Types at line 1

[14:22] *** w_richard_w left
[14:27] <lizmat> Altreus: to make sure it's valid code ?

[14:27] <Altreus> but it is valid code

[14:27] <Altreus> doesn't seem like the p6doc's job

[14:28] <Altreus> that's perl6 -c's job

[14:28] <Altreus> It's valid code if I run it with perl6 -I lib

[14:28] <Altreus> but p6doc doesn't have -I lib

[14:28] <lizmat> ah, then maybe you need something like "=for code :skip-test"

[14:29] <pmurias> b2gills: IMHO a lot of the decisions in the Perl 6 where heavily influenced be preserving the Perl 5 flavor

[14:29] <Altreus> I don't follow what's happening

[14:29] <Altreus> I rather thought the point of p6doc was to read the POD, irrespective of whether the code is valid or not

[14:29] <lizmat> or ":preamble<class API::Discord::Types {};>

[14:30] <Altreus> no but I mean

[14:30] <Altreus> what if it's valid if I install it, but not valid if it's in dev?

[14:30] <Altreus> should I ... have a git hook that removes these things?

[14:30] <Altreus> I guess there's probably PERL6LIB, right?

[14:31] <pmurias> Altreus: isn't

[14:31] <Altreus> that seems to have worked

[14:31] <pmurias> a some documentation generated from the code instead of taken from the pod?

[14:31] <Altreus> hmm

[14:32] <pmurias> Altreus: you can attach Pod to classes and methods

[14:32] <Altreus> It doesn't like the #| form of documentation when attached to a has

[14:33] <Altreus> they all come up as "class Attribute.new"

[17:19] <stmuk> its the "pod" branch in the repo

[17:20] <stmuk> the probably is "perl6 --doc" can't run the code in the absence of installed dependencies

[17:20] *** Ckat3 left
[17:21] *** Facilitating left
[17:21] <tyil> yeah, p6man has the same issue, perl6 --doc=Text as well

[17:21] <tyil> and both p6doc and p6man rely on perl6 --doc behaviour

[17:22] <tyil> I had a hacky solution to work around this, but decided to use perl6 --doc instead because that was what p6doc used

[17:23] <tyil> maybe I should go back and implement the hacky solution to extract pod before trying to parse it

[17:24] <stmuk> yeah pod6 needs to be displayed in a "dumb" way (although this is probably against the whole idea of pod6)

[17:24] <tyil> because I dont think Pod should fail to render because the actual code might contain issues, especially when the iissue is simply a use which was not found

[17:24] *** uzl left
[17:25] <stmuk> if I were a github admin I wouldn't want to have to run code to render pod6

[17:26] <tyil> (fwiw, my hacky solution was to just look for a =begin pod and start saving lines to a temp file until I find a =end pod, then try to render that temp file)

[17:28] <tyil> maybe I can discuss it with jj, he's around here anyway

[18:46] <tbrowder_> regarding pod6 and working code: a separate pod6 parser external to p6 was recently discussed on #perl6-dev and jnthn and others were against it. the pod6 declarator blocks should not have line breaks unless the pod6 has non-breaking spaces in which case they may. declarator block formatting is a feature request i believe.

[19:35] <robertle> I am doing Duration.new(2.rand) and it works often, but sometimes gives me Type check failed in assignment to $!tai; expected Rat but got Num (1534447726.7543569e0)

[19:35] <robertle> which I find surprising: I would have thought that rand always gives me back the same type, but also that duration does take a num, not only a rat...

[22:45] <lucasb> nice!

[22:45] <releasable6> timotimo, Details: https://gist.github.com/27d22acb5eb6ef0d578b8162f79aac48

[22:46] *** kerframil left
[22:47] <lucasb> ^^ look! lowercase hashs! :)

[22:47] <lucasb> and rakudo installs those hashy filenames as uppercase, like 84D9B14D532447225425A06C8065C422465F168D

[22:48] <lucasb> can I make a formal suggestion to lowercase those dir and filenames created inside the installation directory?

[22:49] <lucasb> git uses lowercase, obviously. I know these names aren't supposed to be user-facing, but sometimes you stumble upon them, no?

[22:50] <lucasb> It's a comestic change, but I think it's easier on the eyes to see them lowercase, when you stumble upon a wall of hashs

[22:52] <lucasb> If I submit this request, will I get some support? Any opinion?

[22:55] <timotimo> i wonder how existing repositories should be handled then

[22:57] <lucasb> search both for uppercase and lowercase, but creates always as lowercase (?)

[22:57] <timotimo> startup is already slow :(

[22:58] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¬¶9A45B2B: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[22:58] <lucasb> not thinking about backwards compatibility for a second, would this have a chance in 6.next?

[22:59] <AlexDaniel> so it should be changed because you think lowercase strings look better?

[23:00] <lucasb> a little too subjective? :)

[23:00] *** hoffentlichja left
[23:01] <lucasb> but yeah, I think they look better

[23:01] <lucasb> ooc, do you?

[23:02] <jnthn> I guess uppercase kinda shouts "GO AWAY", which is kinda on point :P

[23:06] <lucasb> 40-char hashes are scary enough already

[23:06] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: so we're now at 2000+ open tickets

[23:06] <AlexDaniel> :)

[23:09] <lucasb> do you mean if we keep opening tickets for superfluous things like these?

[23:09] <lucasb> I agree it's silly

[23:09] <jnthn> No, I think AlexDaniel means we're already there ;)

[23:10] <AlexDaniel> last week was 2003 ‚Üí 2010 https://gist.github.com/82e3048c9a494e95340d73fa3c4cc0e0

[23:10] <AlexDaniel> more stats here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Ticket-updates

[23:11] <lucasb> I was looking at R issues only, almost 500

[23:11] *** pmurias left
[23:11] <lucasb> but anyway, this change, if accepted, would be just a "lc" inserted somewhere :)

[23:12] <AlexDaniel> I believe it can't be that simple :)

[23:13] <AlexDaniel> and I'm serious

[23:14] <jnthn> I believe we do have the ability to version precomp repos, so we can do such changes

[23:14] <jnthn> But yeah, it probably won't be "just insert an lc"

[23:40] <Kaiepi> how can i write a CStruct for this? https://hastebin.com/xovahahori.cpp

[23:45] <Kaiepi> never mind, i don't need it for ICMP

[23:51] <lucasb> my second request is this:

[23:52] <lucasb> Consider the 3 installation paths 

[23:52] <lucasb> install/share/perl6/{core,site,vendor}/

[23:53] <lucasb> expect, there is NO "core" subdirectory. It's mixed with the parent dir of both site and vendor

[23:54] <Kaiepi> wait, yes i do need *mbuf

[23:54] <lucasb> I wish the relevant directories to be nested under a "core" subdirectory (or any other name), just to keep the dir structure in the same hierarchy level

[23:55] <Kaiepi> i want to be able to use the icmp.c functions

[23:55] <lucasb> *except

[23:55] <Kaiepi> i can do icmp without icmp.c, but the functions would be useful to have

[23:57] <SmokeMachine> m: class P { has &.bla; method STORE(|c) { say "STORE: ", c } }; multi trait_mod:<is>(Attribute $attr, Bool :$related) { $attr does role :: { method type { P } } }; class C { has Int @.a is related = say C.^attributes }; say C.^attributes; say C.new # why is it being converted to an array? is it the closure returning the array?
