[06:03] <wbiker> Hi all

[06:04] *** cdg left
[06:06] <wbiker> I have got a hash and want to check certain hash keys for existence. My problem is the hash key names can be upper and/or lower case. My approach would be to go through the hash and create a new hash with all key names in lowercase. Then I can be sure that I find all keys I am looking for doesn't matter if there are in upper or lowe case. Is there another way?

[06:07] <AlexDaniel> wbiker: what about normalizing your keys before adding something to the hash?

[06:08] <AlexDaniel> there are other ways, but that's the most obvious thing I could expect from the code

[06:09] <AlexDaniel> if you need to preserve the original string, put it into the value

[06:10] *** troys left
[06:16] <wbiker> AlexDaniel: Thanks for helping. Good point. Too easy probably :-) But I have to check how this hash is build. It is not my module. It is LWP::Simple. And the hash is the response_header hash with the header names as keys. Has to check wher and what builds it

[11:50] <tbrowder> is there work underway to make a cpan frontend for perl 6 similar to metacpan?

[11:51] <jnthn> I suspect the most likely way to get to that will be evolving modules.perl6.org over time

[11:52] *** holyghost joined
[11:52] <tbrowder> sounds like a plan! thnx

[12:15] <masak> in UTC maybe. here it's more one o'clock-ina

[12:15] <tbrowder> looking at the current modules listing for my modules caused me to file an issue on modules.perl6.org: travis status doesn‚Äôt show their true status.

[12:40] <jkramer> Are you aware of any "code challenge" websites that support P6 for practicing/learning?

[12:41] <jkramer> You know, that kind of website where you get a challenge and some input and then you implement the solution in a language of your choice (on the website), the run the code and if the output is correct (usually using several different test cases to avoid cheating) you pass.

[12:43] <lizmat> something like http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code ?

[12:44] <DrForr> I think he's talking more along the lines of hackerrank?

[12:45] <DrForr> https://code-golf.io/ is a different thing among the same vein, but it does in fact support Perl6. Disclaimer: I've only used hackerrank.

[12:47] * AlexDani` is still wondering how it's possible to get evil numbers down to 25 freaking characters

[12:47] *** AlexDani` is now known as AlexDaniel

[12:51] <jkramer> DrForr: Yeah I know codingame.com which is nice, but they only have P5.

[12:52] <jkramer> Thanks I'll check out code-golf.io

[12:54] <DrForr> tbrowder: Yes, rather.

[12:55] <tbrowder> i just removed the ‚Äú?branch=master‚Äù from my github README.md file in the hope that will change the travis statuses to a green check. how often does modules.perl6.org run its module checks?

[12:59] <lizmat> it's simple a link to an image on the travis-ci.org site, isn't it ?

[12:59] <lizmat> *simply

[13:01] <jkramer> Shouldn't "rakudobrew build moar" get me the latest version? I just did and it built something, but I'm still on 2017-07, even though list-available has 2017-12 listed.

[13:01] <jkramer> Do I need to `switch` or anything?

[13:02] <tbrowder> yes, maybe, but i looked at one of zoffix‚Äôs modules that shows a travis green check and his readme.md had a slightly different syntax: no branch soecification.

[13:03] <tbrowder> *spec. my status on github shows green, but on modules shows not setup.

[13:06] <jkramer> Oh nice, made it on #4 on code-golf.io's "divisors" challenge on the first try :D

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> very interesting post

[13:52] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: thank you  :-)

[13:52] <El_Che> "Place a moratorium on new features, with development confined to maintenance on the current runtime." <-- pretty sure some people spilt some coffee :)

[13:53] <lizmat> El_Che: to some people who would have spilt coffee over that, they knew this was coming

[13:54] <lizmat> I've circulated drafts of this post to many people in the Perl community for the past month or so

[13:54] <El_Che> that's pretty my the last discussion on p5P

[13:54] *** efg joined
[13:55] <El_Che> s/my //

[13:56] <DrForr> I haven't had a chance to read that deeply; will do that when I get back to my desk.

[13:56] <leont> The general mood at the top of p5p can be summarized to "why can't we have nice things", but generally speaking almost any new language feature since Larry left has been a failure, except two or three minor ones (defined or, s///r and perhaps say)

[13:57] <leont> Not trying too hard on the new features wouldn't be a bad thing in my book, though I would love to get usable signatures.

[13:57] <rjbs> I use signatures every day and they are terrific.

[13:58] <rjbs> Also postfix dereferencing.

[13:58] <rjbs> Also lexical subroutines.

[13:58] <timotimo> i use signatures every day, too, but i use only perl 6 :P

[13:58] <lizmat> rjbs  o/

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: does it mean that you're -1 on things like https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1356 because it kinda goes the opposite way from what the post is talking about?

[14:00] *** pmurias joined
[14:01] <pmurias> what is an STR on Match supposed to be (as opposed to a Str method)?

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> I'm just thikinking that we've been doing some changes lately (for mostly technical reasons?) that are pushing towards the break-off from perl¬†5, and the article talks about uniting both languages in a way‚Ä¶ hmm

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> thikinking, yes‚Ä¶

[14:02] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: working on a comment to the issue

[14:03] <timotimo> pmurias: maybe it's for nqp interoperability?

[14:03] <timotimo> or perhaps just an internal helper method that we didn't want to make private

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: other related things: https://github.com/perl6/6.d-prep/issues/3#issuecomment-355111122 https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1705

[14:07] *** Exodist joined
[14:08] <leont> p5 on nqp sounds interesting, but the different memory model sounds like a PITA, even without the lack of XS (I know cpython versus jpython also had this issue)

[14:09] <lizmat> leont: could you elaborate ?

[14:09] *** epony left
[14:09] <leont> refcounting versus gc, basically

[14:09] <pmurias> the lack of reference counting means that DESTROY is called at different times

[14:09] <lizmat> yup, there's that

[14:10] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: fwiw maybe I'm misreading but that ticket is about these variables only: https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/1f54bd963c2d75a7b7b28a17777def4682c28436/S32-exceptions/misc.t#L195-L207

[14:10] <leont> RAII patterns are quite common in perl, even when people aren't used to think about it in those terms (in particular, people assume they don't need to close their filehandlers)

[14:25] <lizmat> fwiw: modules for the CPAN Butterfly Plan so far: http://modules.perl6.org/t/CPAN5

[14:31] <scimon> So the goal is for the replacement modules to be as close as possible (barring syntax differences like -> to . and $a) to the P5 versions? 

[14:31] <lizmat> the goal is that the API is as close as possible

[14:32] <lizmat> inside a ported module all bets are off

[14:40] <timotimo> is WWW::Mechanize even useful nowadays? it doesn't do JS on its own, right? or is it just a front-end API module and you slot in webkit or something anyway?

[14:42] <scimon> It does not it's pure HTML link following and form posting. But apparently lots of people like it and I saw it mentioned here a few weeks ago some one said "I tried to get a friend to use Perl6 but they wouldn't becuase WWW:Mechanize" didn't exist.

[14:42] <leont> People use it. Not all of the web has fallen to the insanity of javascript frameworks yet

[14:42] <DrForr> ::Firefox handles most of those needs.

[14:43] <scimon> Also... well it can be quite good for testing none js based sites. (I've never really used it directly except in test suites).

[14:43] <DrForr> I've got the outline of a Spreadsheet:: module that needs finishing, but then what module *doesn't*?

[14:45] <scimon> The ones that aren't used any more?

[14:46] <scimon> Getting the DBI and DBIc stuff in place and up to scratch would be another good one.

[14:46] <lizmat> yeah, fortunately, DBIx::Class is almost completely PurePerl

[14:51] <tbrowder> lizmat: love the plan, and two of my modules are ports of all or part of p5 modules.

[14:58] <lizmat> tbrowder: please add the CPAN5 tag to your META6.json then  :-)

[15:09] <El_Che> it's interesting as an upgrade plan for Perl 5, but I wonder if you don't end up with a lot of anti-patterns instead of a more Perl6-ideomatic way of doing things. Will you end up with P5:: and P6:: competings modules?

[15:10] <scimon> So... in my ongoing quest to try out all the different things you can do with Signatures I seem to have hit a wall. If there anyway of looking at the values in self within a method signature? (Which... is kind of bonkers I know but I've tried alll the sane things)

[15:11] <scimon> El_Che: One would hope that the P5 versions would be phased out. Possibly you could pin a version and say "This is the last version who's API is based on the Perl5 module) and then start iterating. 

[15:12] <El_Che> If the P5 version is stable & feature complete (otherwise people won't use it), I don't see that happening

[15:13] <DrForr> scimon: You can look at the signature that someone's called you with - my App::Prancer does something like that.

[15:15] <DrForr> You also can't guarantee that the person that wants to do a fully Perl6 version and the person that did the Perl5 version are the same, and have the same approach. I'd be for cordoning them off in a Perl5:: namespace, or possibly even adding a tag like :version<> or :from<>, maybe :api<Perl5> that can be grep'ed for straightforwardly.

[15:17] <scimon> (On the method sig thing I finally worked out how to do what I wanted to do) multi method do-thing( $self where ! $self.test: ) { note "Skipping this won't work"; } )

[15:17] <El_Che> I am curious about lizmat's porting guidelines. Is the API kept? Would the naming of functions be identical to perl5 and alien to perl6? What about signatures or threading?

[15:18] <DrForr> Or even that Perl5 modules will be worked on before the Perl6 implementation.

[15:18] <scimon> Well I think we partly want to wait for the mentioned document ;)

[15:19] <El_Che> I started working on a Net::LDAP port some time ago (stranded because of acute shortage of time), and I had this questions all the time in the back of my head

[15:20] <El_Che> the other idea in the back in my head was "wouldn't it be easier just to bind to the C library?"

[15:20] <DrForr> And I'd really like to get started on Excel read/write, even though I really have no desire to work with spreadsheets, this is only because I see so many places still using them.

[15:21] <scimon> Spreadsheets are never going away. 

[15:21] <DrForr> And that I'd want definitely to use a 6-inspired API, possibly with a ::Perl5 module below to act as a shi.

[15:21] <DrForr> *shim

[15:21] <scimon> (Excel going away would be nice)

[15:24] <scimon> Because as a document format all the xls versions are horrible.

[15:27] <timotimo> oi, spreadsheets are amazing

[15:27] <timotimo> the way they empower people doesn't compare to anything else

[15:29] <pmurias> re porting over Perl 5 modules with old APIs, why would we want to do that?

[15:30] <El_Che> pmurias: if I follow lizmat's view to facilitate a straight migration

[15:30] <stmuk_> what was the reason (other than programmer time) "v5" stalled? I recall vaguely something to do with "goto"?

[15:30] *** stmuk_ is now known as stmuk

[15:32] <moritz> does there need to be any reason except programmer time/motivation?

[15:32] *** someuser left
[15:32] <El_Che> moritz: it's presented as a march direction to unite the communities

[15:32] <stmuk> maybe it was something to do with labels in tests?

[15:32] <yoleaux> 12 Jan 2018 14:44Z <lizmat> stmuk: is the "iniside" in the "title "Perl 6 Iniside Out" of the syndication of Shitov's blog post intentional or a typo ?

[15:32] <El_Che> moritz: not as a an "itch"

[15:33] <moritz> Pugs was the march direction for Perl 6, and it stalled when audreyt left

[15:33] <pmurias> moritz: that's a serious enough obstacle, but it's also interesting if there is a more technical obstacle

[15:33] <El_Che> moritz: true

[15:34] <DrForr> One benefit might be that you find people more willing to port existing modules where they have code to translate rather than have to make up new code...

[15:35] <El_Che> DrForr: the langs are different enough that you'll end transposing instead of porting

[15:35] <scimon> I've loved spreadsheets since I first saw visicalc. 

[15:35] <DrForr> I'm trying to gloss over that :) (Remember, I *did* write Perl::ToPerl5 :) )

[15:35] <DrForr> s/5/6/;

[15:36] <DrForr> (damnit)

[15:36] <El_Che> lol

[15:36] <pmurias> DrForr: porting over codes (regardless if it's from Perl 5/Ruby/etc) makes sense what I'm questioning is the need to have botha Perl 5 flavored and a Perl 6 flavored variants of APIs

[15:36] <stmuk> I think perl6 was supposed (originally) to be able to use perl5 cpan modules

[15:37] <El_Che> pmurias: that was also my question (with the addition that we may end up with old style api's and/or antipatterns in a Perl 6 context)

[15:37] <DrForr> Liz did point out 'use v5;'.

[15:37] <El_Che> stmuk: perl 6 was supposed to be the next version of perl 5 as well :)

[15:38] <pmurias> El_Che: Perl 6 can use perl 5 modules with Inline::Perl5

[15:40] <El_Che> pmurias: I know, and while I admire the effort and result, it's a road I don't want in my project

[15:40] <El_Che> pmurias: (with a SRE/architect/the-guy-that-deploys hat)

[15:41] <DrForr> "I am the one who deploys."</heisenberg>

[15:41] <stmuk> https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/ # The main missing pieces that hurt are:

[15:41] <stmuk> labels and goto/barewords and pseudo filehandles

[15:41] <stmuk> etc

[15:42] <El_Che> perl 6 stack is complex enough, you don't want to manage perl5 , python and ruby stack on the same project

[15:44] <DrForr> More modules are fine, and I'm for whatever gets more into the ecosystem. I think the overarching problem is that we simply don't have the application base yet. The cruelty is that smaller modules are easier to talk about, and you as the author don't have to use them in anger, as it were.

[15:46] <El_Che> Well, more than once I looked at Perl 6 and Golang for a project and I ended with Perl 5. There is no way I'll add complexity to a project by managing perl 5 in perl 6 or play with C bidings in go.

[15:46] <El_Che> (ending with Perl 5 was not a bad thing for me, but I wanted to try new things)

[15:47] *** lowbro left
[15:48] <tbrowder> it would helpful to create a category in the most-wanted module list for things the experts believe is needed to make Perl 6 able to be the go-to language for advanced users and uses.

[15:49] <El_Che> cro is a nice addition now that micro services are in. It could result in an ecosystem like it was the case with Mojo

[15:50] <stmuk> I don't think "v5" works anymore anyway .. or didn't last time I looked

[15:50] <DrForr> Right, so Inline::Perl5 isn't a long-term solution. Agreeing on that; and I think the problem (again, having delved into it) is that the two languages have diverged enough that there really isn't a simple migration track. XS needs to be rewritten (I.E. scrapped and maybe simplified), and there are too many gotchas lurking in trying to mechanically transate 5 => 6 that you'd be rewriting the 5 compiler.

[15:51] <El_Che> DrForr: Inline::Perl5 is not a short-time solution either imho. It's cool, nice, but not something I would give a green light for production.

[15:51] <El_Che> (I would totally use it locally, though)

[15:52] <El_Che> of course, maybe other people look at it differently

[15:52] <DrForr> Perl::ToPerl6 goes through the motions of translationg operators and basic accesses, but what it leaves behind you'd have to know Perl 6 in order to see the intent, so I don't think it's a viable route.

[15:54] <DrForr> Now, one thought that *does* come to mind with PPR (I had some other issues that I hit with PPI that haven't been fixed to my knowledge) it might be possible to at least start a cross-compiler, leaving behind blocks that can't be translated in comments rather than just leaving them in-situ for the poor programmer to puzzle out.

[15:54] <El_Che> DrForr: Inline::Perl5 is part of the category "I-really-really-want-to-use-Perl6-for-this-project" instead of "Perl 6 is a really good fit for this problem"

[15:55] <DrForr> Yeah, "I've gotta have module X to do this, the rest I can do in 6" or something similar?

[15:55] <DrForr> And I wouldn't be deploying it in a mixed environment either, FWIW.

[16:03] <scimon> The stuff lizmat has done so far is interesting. I was looking through List::Utils (which generally you don't *need* in Perl6) and I can see the use of being able to Take a script that uses it in Perl5 and just drop that in. 

[16:03] <scimon> Tie's too. Pesky things but used in a lot of places.

[16:06] *** pmurias left
[16:06] *** pmurias joined
[16:07] <DrForr> scimon: Yes, if you're doing an automatic translator it helps to not have to translate idioms from List::Util over to raw perl6 code and run risks.

[16:10] <DrForr> One nice precursor to have might be code that looks at a block of Perl 5 code and properly creates inline #`(..) comments to surround it, because of how 5 and 6 use (){}[] differently. One less thing to worry about when transliterating.

[16:10] <DrForr> Having a P6 version of PPR would be too much to ask, I fear, especially knowing how radically different the RE engines are.

[16:12] <El_Che> The question (I don't have an answer) is of people will convert old and big codebases

[16:13] *** sjoshi joined
[16:14] <scimon> Well.... many of the big old codebases I know of are under constant work. And people are moving away from monoliths and stuff. If you can write a new part of a system in Perl6 but use existing data sources that would be a win.

[16:15] <DrForr> If it's old and big, then I'm not sure what we can do to mitigate, because quite often the answer will be simply to scrap it and rewrite. At which point the question is "rewrite it in what?" And perl6 won't come up, because Python or Go or whatever.

[16:16] <DrForr> Having a tool that'll rewrite 5 to 6 in an enterprise-ready fashion will help, but the cost/benefit ratio for the person that does it...

[16:16] <El_Che> scimon: yes, and you write that in ideomatic perl 6

[16:16] <El_Che> scimon: or in whatever lang you want for your micro service

[16:17] <DrForr> Cro then is sthe system you'd want to push for that, at least in p6, I'd think.

[16:17] <El_Che> that's tbrowder's remark: what is needed to make cro more useful

[16:17] <DrForr> Once I get finished with the bloody talks I'll dive into PPR, I suppose.

[16:19] <DrForr> Hometime, have fun.

[16:19] <scimon> You too

[19:55] <jberger> and that seems to be true

[19:55] <jberger> and I have to say, it is pretty upsetting to me

[19:56] <lizmat> fwiw, I don't think Perl 5 needs anybody outside to kill perl5: I think p5p at the moment is doing a fine job

[19:56] <DrForr> Note to self: fold riot shield out of something before giving talk.

[19:56] <jberger> that and the lack of a path forward for us sure

[19:56] <jberger> now I wonder what effort has caused that?

[19:57] <jberger> I don't hate Perl 6, I don't dislike Perl 6, mostly I don't think very much about Perl 6

[19:57] <lizmat> then you don't have anything to worry about

[19:57] <jberger> and yet while our version is less than yours we are marked for death

[20:19] <El_Che> lizmat: stagnation feature wise and perception of stagnation are related but not the same thing. The no mayor version number possible did hurt Perl 5 dramatically if I look in my surroundings.

[20:19] <El_Che> so, in this case you and jberger both have a point

[20:19] <lizmat> ok, but has it been hurting in the last say 5 years ?

[20:20] <tadzik> I think it speaks volumes that there's a "Perl 6 core development fund" and a "Perl 5 core maintenance fund"

[20:20] <El_Che> I think so

[20:20] <tadzik> and I don't think any community meme caused that :)

[20:20] <lizmat> tadzik: good point, didn't even think of that  :-)

[20:20] <El_Che> again not directly tied ti progress or lack of in p5p (although related), but in the perception of old and potential users

[20:21] <lizmat> so what would possibly change that perception?  

[20:21] *** domidumont left
[20:21] <lizmat> Perl 6 getting another name?  won't happen, that ship has sailed

[20:21] <El_Che> start with leaving the Perl 6 name (I know, I know)

[20:22] <lizmat> bumping Perl 5 to Perl 7 ?  Won't that be seen as just putting the same old wine in a new bottle ?

[20:22] <El_Che> now, not 5 or 2 years ago, the name has only downsides for both Perl 5 and 6

[20:22] <moritz> not true

[20:22] <El_Che> lizmat: it may well be, but it's to the perl 5 communty to decide or fix that

[20:22] <moritz> there are many folks who see "Perl" as a strong brand

[20:23] <El_Che> moritz: it is a strong brand

[20:23] <El_Che> moritz: but it's a Perl 5 brand

[20:23] <El_Che> *not* a Perl 6 brand

[20:23] <moritz> El_Che: many people don't make that distinction

[20:23] <moritz> which is both blessing and curse, but it is what it is

[20:24] <El_Che> the deciding factor is if it's more of a course or more of a blessing today

[20:24] <El_Che> -o

[20:25] <El_Che> In my opinion, it hurts Perl 5 today and it doesn not bring much to Perl 6 anymore

[20:25] <El_Che> those who wanted to switch did already

[20:25] <El_Che> those happy in Perl 5 will stay there

[20:26] <El_Che> and many new users won't give Perl 6 a go because they think it's 2005's Perl 5

[20:26] <moritz> my experience is different

[20:26] <lizmat> fwiw, mine as well

[20:26] <moritz> I've written Perl 6 articles for IT journals

[20:26] <El_Che> moritz: again, subjective as hell

[20:26] *** jberger joined
[20:26] <jberger> sorry, I shouldn't have jumped off, I was just very upset

[20:26] <moritz> and there seems to be continuous interest about it

[20:26] <lizmat> jberger: I understand

[20:26] <lizmat> and I'm sorry

[20:27] <moritz> and people said "oh, I wanted to check that out, but it didn't seem mature enough"

[20:27] <moritz> and then they give it another go

[20:27] <jberger> all I want to say is that (unless this has changed) we don't have any recourse

[20:27] <jberger> we need you guys to say they are separate languages

[20:27] <jberger> I would love to rename one or the toher

[20:27] <moritz> and they tell me about all the cool things they've done with perl 4 and perl 5 and so on

[20:27] <jberger> I would love to release Perl 5 as Perl 7 or 28 or whatever, but I've been told that isn't allowed either

[20:27] <moritz> so, it doesn't seem that interest in Perl 6 would be there without the "Perl" brand

[20:28] <El_Che> moritz: sure, true, but that's the Perl 6 is the succesor of 5 mindset

[20:28] <tadzik> there was a mention of Perl 5 being marked for death, but I can't help too think that it did this to itself

[20:28] <jberger> so in the meantime, we (p5) ONLY have the sister languages story

[20:28] <El_Che> (of those users, not yours)

[20:28] <tadzik> a few years ago I recall a talk of a p5-mop as a potential core feature

[20:28] <El_Che> pixie

[20:28] <lizmat> jberger: things change

[20:28] <jberger> but if the story really becomes p6 replaces p5 then literally we die out

[20:29] <tadzik> a few months ago I watched sawyer's talk about new features in P5, and my takeaway from it was "there'll be an avocado in our Unicode support, also we're finally stabilizing that feature that Fortran had"

[20:29] <jberger> lizmat: we aren't going to let that happen, the actual other option is war

[20:29] <tadzik> (sub signatures)

[20:29] <jberger> people make their livings on p5

[20:29] <jberger> me includes

[20:29] <jberger> included

[20:29] <tadzik> these days when people say "Oh, you do Perl, isn't Perl dead?" I just say "well, programming languages never die"

[20:29] <jberger> managers being told that p5 is dead changes my actual life

[20:30] <tadzik> I make a living off of P5 too

[20:30] <lizmat> jberger: and now you're accusing me to rob you of your livelyhood ?

[20:30] <jberger> yes I am

[20:30] <mspo> jberger: that's been happening for years, though

[20:30] <jberger> this is the story we agreed to

[20:30] <jberger> mspo: I would love to have seen it happen differently

[20:30] <jberger> this is where we ARE

[20:30] <tadzik> and in the back of my head there's always "if I continue on this path, I'll be an equivalent of a cobol programmer 30 years from now"

[20:30] <jberger> sister languages is our agreement, our detange

[20:30] <jberger> detante

[20:30] <mspo> I learned perl5 in ~2000 and by 2005 python was on the first part of its big upswing

[20:31] <mspo> with little upsets by ruby

[20:31] <jberger> if p6 doesn't want to abide by that, it has to be war, and I DON'T want that

[20:31] <mspo> and perl was already seen as old :)

[20:31] * lizmat doesn't want that either

[20:31] <jberger> so hold the line, why do you have to try to win?

[20:31] * lizmat believes arms are for hugging

[20:31] <jberger> p5 can't win, that's decided unless we are given or take a new version number

[20:32] <jberger> lizmat: then please act like it

[20:32] <jberger> those quote earlier are really bad

[20:32] <El_Che> the sister narrative was a way to burry the major release trouble

[20:32] <El_Che> if that goes away, the problems returns

[20:32] <tadzik> you really think that a new version number will change *anything*?

[20:32] <jberger> tadzik: PHP just proved that it does

[20:32] <El_Che> maybe it's a good idea to finally fix it

[20:32] <jberger> PHP7 is getting good press

[20:32] <mspo> php7 was a big enhancement

[20:32] <jberger> it added some minor features, fixed complaints

[20:32] <mspo> I got a 40% performance improvement "for free"

[20:32] <jberger> people are seeing it in a different light

[20:33] <mspo> like qualified and everything

[20:33] <jberger> it really IS a thing, not just something a few of us have been screaming into the void

[20:33] <El_Che> I know about the "ship has sailed thing", but I feel we're all loosing ATM

[20:33] <jberger> El_Che: I agree

[20:33] <lizmat> ok, let me get this straight: the sister language meme is keeping Perl 5 from dying, because Perl 6 is not renamed to something else, and a bump to version 7 is not allowed

[20:34] <jberger> yes

[20:34] <jberger> otherwise people who don't know (and that's most of them, think non-technical managers)

[20:34] <mspo> jberger: are you trying to safe the perl5 language or the runtime?

[20:34] <jberger> they don't understand how 6 doesn't replace 5

[20:34] <tadzik> well if perl 5.30 got a 40% perf bump, I'll be telling it to everyone

[20:34] <jberger> so we have to tell them that, over and over and over

[20:34] <tadzik> but all I have to say now is "their unicode support is getting better!"

[20:35] <mspo> yeah that php7 thing was no joke

[20:35] <jberger> the highest version number is the winner

[20:35] <tadzik> which, let's face it, is only appealing to an infinitesimal audience

[20:35] <jberger> tadzik: there are plenty of things p5 could do with a major version number release

[20:35] <tadzik> in the general case, nobody gives a shit

[20:35] <lizmat> jberger: are you trying to safe the perl5 language or the runtime?

[20:35] <jberger> strict and warnings by default, signatures

[20:36] <jberger> mspo: there is only one runtime

[20:36] <tadzik> jberger: is that really what's keeping p5p for changing things for the better though? "We can't because we can't change a version number significantly enough?"

[20:36] <jberger> sure it would be great if there were more

[20:36] <lizmat> so: 2 lines less in each properly maintained module and a feature that all other languages in the world already have for decades ?

[20:36] <jberger> but right now there is only one

[20:36] <tadzik> they just don't want to drop support to 90% of their users, which is understandable

[20:37] <jberger> lizmat: sane defaults for newcomers and let us decide what is good for us please

[20:37] <mspo> jberger: I know but it's a question is all

[20:37] *** Scimon joined
[20:37] <lizmat> jberger: there is no single Perl 5 runtime anymore: there's rperl, cperl, perlito

[20:37] <mspo> there is only one that matters

[20:37] <lizmat> jberger: but you were talking about features that would attract new Perl 5 users

[20:37] <jberger> lizmat: fine, but lets say they are under the umbrella, possibly with the exception of perlito

[20:37] <jberger> lizmat: yes

[20:37] <jberger> are we allowed to want new users?

[20:38] <lizmat> yes, of course

[20:38] <mspo> jberger: perl5 should port to moar and evolve from there as something else :)

[20:38] <jberger> mspo: great, who's doing that?

[20:38] <mspo> moarvm could use the man power!

[20:38] <jberger> moar is like, what, 3 years old?

[20:38] <lizmat> and your point is?

[20:38] <jberger> we couldn't have known which backend to target until like a year ago

[20:38] <jberger> so maybe it will, but it will take time

[20:39] <lizmat> well, that's my point: things *are* changing

[20:39] <jberger> and in the meantime the existing problems dont go away

[20:39] <mspo> larry owns "perl", right?

[20:39] <lizmat> afaik, yes

[20:39] <tadzik> it's younger than pypy, which hasn't even attracted the attention of the whole python community :)

[20:39] <jberger> lizmat: who's going to spend all the time porting a language that is dead to a new mv?

[20:39] <jberger> vm

[20:39] <[Coke]> http://news.perlfoundation.org/2018/01/tpcislc-2018.html

[20:39] <tadzik> great, that's what the open letter was for

[20:40] <mspo> like you said, a major version bump could bring a lot of good changes

[20:40] <mspo> but without that freedom it is "dead"

[20:40] <lizmat> jberger: my point is that Perl 5 as a language is *not* dead

[20:40] <jberger> without that freedom and without the help of the owners of the higher version number

[20:40] <lizmat> but that perl5 as a runtime is nearing its end of life

[20:40] <tadzik> oh come on

[20:40] <jberger> lizmat: you REALLY didn't say that

[20:40] <moritz> fwiw rakudo dropped moar in Jul 2016, and it was clear that moar was the winner long before that

[20:40] <Phil21> haha

[20:40] <Phil21> I can guarantee you zero business leaders care about perl5's runtime :)

[20:40] <tadzik> how many years is it taking p5p to standarize and accept signatures as a given?

[20:40] <Phil21> (the ones who give me money to pay dev teams)

[20:41] <tadzik> and supposedly bumping a number would make development faster? Features more modern?

[20:41] <mspo> https://www.perl.com/article/an-open-letter-to-the-perl-community/ sounds great

[20:41] <lizmat> if anything, I'm trying to conserve all of the people years of development of Perl 5 modules

[20:41] <jberger> is XS going to work in moar?

[20:42] <lizmat> no

[20:42] <lizmat> never

[20:42] <tadzik> p5 has a perfectly good way of bringing new features to the language without breaking backcompat

[20:42] <tadzik> it's just not doing it

[20:42] <lizmat> well, maybe  not never

[20:42] <lizmat> everything becomes fluid under pressure, but I don't see XS being ported

[20:42] <lizmat> because Perl 6 has NativeCall

[20:42] <Scimon> jberger: if you need it then why not write pure C libs and use NativeCall?

[20:42] <lizmat> for all of the external library interfacing

[20:43] <lizmat> and for the speedup  argument: running on a VM that does inlining should remove the need for optimizing by hand

[20:43] <tadzik> I guess half (or more) of XS stuff is not for *external* interfacing

[20:43] <tadzik> it's digging deeper into 5

[20:44] <lizmat> many of the introspection XS code, is built in into Perl 6

[20:44] <lizmat> Sub::Name being a prime example of that

[20:44] <tadzik> often to compensate for what could be seen as its shortcomings

[20:44] *** petdance joined
[20:44] <leont> I can imagine a subset of XS being ported, but as soon as people start using PerlAPI that does out of the window pretty quickly

[20:45] <leont> And IME most real XS does use the api

[20:45] <lizmat> indeed: but as Scimon said: why not write C code and NativeCall it ?

[20:45] <lizmat> perhaps we need to focus more on porting Inline::C

[20:47] <Scimon> As is my way I've played about a bit with Native Call and it's impressive how fast you can get stuff done. Thing is you're then losing the power of which ever VM you are running on.

[20:47] <Scimon> (I would guess)

[20:48] *** petdance left
[20:50] <lizmat> Scimon: afaik, NativeCall works on both MoarVM and JVM backends

[20:50] *** evalable6 left
[20:50] <lizmat> Javascript backend will be a bit more troublesome, especially when running in the browser, I guess

[20:51] *** evalable6 joined
[20:52] <jberger> anyway, none of this matters, the runtime of p5 isn't going to materially change any part of this in the medium term

[20:53] <mspo> jberger: what do you want to happen?

[20:56] <sena_kun> _cough_ I don't know what I'm writing about right now, so apologizing in advance and, please, don't pay any attention my post at all, just my 5 cents. Languages are just tools. If you make money by writing a software, it is plain as day that you can(and should) learn many of them. You cannot, like, learn language X(be it any langauge, literally ANY) and use it forever and ever. I'm using java/perl 6/python/nodejs/plain js plus things like 

[20:56] <sena_kun> haskell on a daily basis and I don't think it's mpossible. When I needed to read/write perl, php, go or, oh gosh, VisualBasic - well, I just did it and that's all. It's just given. In the end of the day, there are some differences, but it's just some data and algorithms.

[20:56] <jberger> mspo: I think I've said that several times but I'd say it again. Best case, p6 renames and/or p5 rolls version say 28 ("and" preferably). In the absence of that just not shooting the horse in the head

[20:57] <jberger> sena_kun: no need to apologize. This really has nothing to do with syntax, in fact syntax is almost a distraction

[20:57] *** kraih joined
[20:58] <lizmat> jberger: about 6 years ago, I was of the same opinion, believe it or not

[20:58] <kraih> lizmat: just wanted to tell you that i'm very disappointed with your letter, what you're doing is not good for either language :(

[20:59] <lizmat> kraih: I'm sorry to hear that

[20:59] <lizmat> I know the path to hell is paved with good intentions  :-(

[21:00] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:00] <lizmat> even just before the 6.c release in December 2015, it would have been possible to change the name of Perl 6

[21:01] *** TEttinger joined
[21:01] <lizmat> but now we're more than 2 years down the road again

[21:01] <lizmat> there are now 7 Perl 6 books published compared to one re-release of a Perl 5 book since then

[21:02] <jberger> lizmat: plenty of people asked for that to happen, to say now that you could have then but didn't is crazy

[21:02] <jberger> "the ship has

[21:02] <lizmat> and if you read this book: https://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Orange-Glow-Untold-Cyberculture/dp/1101871555

[21:02] <jberger> sailed" has been the argument for years

[21:03] <jberger> look at the comments on my blog posts from years ago

[21:03] <jberger> I would have LOVED that, so why didn't it?

[21:03] <lizmat> you will see at least one language that I have been proficient in and made my livelihood in

[21:03] <lizmat> that just doesn't exist anymore

[21:03] <jberger> lizmat: sure, things change

[21:03] <lizmat> right

[21:03] <jberger> but if people take an active role in changing my life against my will I'm going to react

[21:04] <jberger> and right now, that person is unfortunately you

[21:04] *** Kaiepi left
[21:04] <jberger> btw Perl 5 would love to change (or I'd like to see it at least)

[21:04] <kraih> trying to destroy perl5 won't make perl6 magically happen, you have to actually put in real work and build up a new identity

[21:04] <jberger> what recourse do you see that we have?

[21:04] *** wamba left
[21:04] <kraih> Perl 6 is a dead brand, it's never going to happen

[21:05] <lizmat> well, I think Perl 5 as a *language* has so much to offer, that it should be preserved

[21:05] <kraih> and you're dragging down Perl 5

[21:05] <lizmat> kraih: I'm sorry you feel the existence of Perl 6 is dragging down Perl 5

[21:06] <lizmat> jberger: I think I said it in my blog post:

[21:06] <kraih> as a language i don't care about Perl 6, it's the name

[21:06] <lizmat> I would really love to see p5p become *Porters* again

[21:06] <jberger> lizmat: great, join up and donate your time

[21:07] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:07] *** wamba joined
[21:07] <lizmat> jberger: I've already donated quite a bit

[21:07] <lizmat> and not just for Perl 6

[21:07] <jberger> I know, and you've done a lot for both languages

[21:07] <lizmat> as a latest example: without Wendy and me there would not have been a TPCiA (aka YAPC::Europe) this year

[21:07] <jberger> but that doesn't mean that current p5p users should chase a fools errand while p6 lobs grenades at us

[21:07] <Scimon> Here's the thing. If we create API similar versions of major Perl5 libs for Perl6 who does that hurt?

[21:08] <lizmat> if p5p users don't want to participate, it's their good right!

[21:08] <jberger> lizmat: so why would they if you are saying that perl5 feature development should stop?

[21:08] <lizmat> it's open source, dammit, and it depends on *volunteers* (and people who get paid to be volunteers :-)

[21:08] <jberger> lizmat: totally agree

[21:09] <jberger> I don't think you'll see anyone take you up on this proposal is all I'm saying

[21:09] <jberger> what is the benefit?

[21:09] <lizmat> I hope you're wrong, but there is that chance, yes

[21:09] <lizmat> in any case, *I* have already started porting stuff

[21:09] <lizmat> http://modules.perl6.org/t/CPAN5

[21:09] <Scimon> You have it's scarily impressive. :)

[21:09] <jberger> to perl6 or to another p5 language runtime?

[21:10] <jberger> you are allowed to port perl5 libraries as their licenses permit

[21:10] <jberger> that is really irrelevant to this discussion

[21:10] <lizmat> I see the CPAN Butterfly Plan as a prerequisite for a *possible* Butterfly Perl 5

[21:11] <jberger> but what benefit is that to perl5?

[21:11] <Scimon> Well I think that's the thing there were a few parts to lizmat's post.

[21:11] <jberger> anyway, I really need to get back to $work

[21:11] <Phil21> ^

[21:11] <jberger> I've spent too much immediate time on this as it is

[21:11] <jberger> (Phil21 is my boss)

[21:12] <jberger> (and sometime sponsor of perl events)

[21:12] <Scimon> I'm focussing my efforts on the "making perl6 libraries that are functionally similar to perl5 ones" to make it easier for people to migrate.

[21:12] <lizmat> jberger: thanks for your time, and Phil21: it's my fault

[21:12] <Phil21> it's an interesting conversation

[21:12] <TEttinger> I think at least backwards-incompatible (breaking) features shouldn't be added to perl5, it's responsible for a lot of stability stuff and it would be hard to have the issue of "you have to use an older version of perl5 than the current perl5 to use library X"

[21:12] <Phil21> that is somewhat dear to me, but don't really have enough of a foot in the community to really make any comments :)

[21:12] <Phil21> just seems like an argument that's been going on for a decade+ :/

[21:13] <lizmat> Phil21: thank you for letting jberger comment :-)

[21:13] <Phil21> lizmat: thanks for all your hard work!

[21:13] <lizmat> *blush*  :-)

[21:14] *** petdance joined
[21:15] <petdance> Here's the key: Is Perl 6 a sister language or not?

[21:15] <petdance> Can both languages co-exist?

[21:15] <petdance> What I read in the open letter and in the IRC logs is that no, Liz does not want to co-exist with Perl 5.  

[21:15] <petdance> Is that the opinion of the Perl 6 community as a whole?

[21:16] <kraih> this channel has always been hostile towards Perl 5

[21:16] <Scimon> IMO they will both co-exist for a googly long time.

[21:16] <lizmat> what?

[21:16] <lizmat> kraih: what ?

[21:16] <Scimon> (goodly)

[21:16] <kraih> it scared me away from the community a few years back when i started a Mojolicious port

[21:16] <moritz> kraih: that is simply not true

[21:17] <moritz> I use perl 5 for $work, and don't experience hostility here

[21:17] <Scimon> I have to agree. Heck most perl6 devs are perl5 devs too in some way or other.

[21:17] <Scimon> Me too.

[21:17] <kraih> but that's another argument

[21:17] *** zakharyas left
[21:17] <moritz> petdance: I don't think it's the opinion of the whole Perl 6 community

[21:17] <Scimon> I think what you do have here is people who get paid to write perl5 (ifthey are lucky) who would much rather write perl6 

[21:18] <El_Che> kraih: I don't agree with that

[21:18] <Scimon> I personally would just like to make it easier to sell Perl6 to devs and management. 

[21:18] <petdance> Is Perl 6 a sister language or is that idea of coexisting with Perl 5 a "fiction" that was a "necessary evil"?

[21:18] *** stmuk_ joined
[21:18] <Scimon> Making it easy for a perl5 dev to move to Perl6 by giving them modules they recognise is part of it.

[21:18] *** wamba left
[21:19] <moritz> petdance: please don't create false dychtonomies

[21:19] <moritz> petdance: things can change without the past being a fiction

[21:19] <petdance> Fiction isn't my word.

[21:19] <moritz> (not that I say they did change)

[21:19] <petdance> I'm just quoting.

[21:19] <moritz> "fiction" then

[21:19] <petdance> That's exactly what I wrote.

[21:19] <El_Che> petdance: Liz' opinion is pretty clear on the log, the question is where to go from here

[21:19] <petdance> I know what her opinion is.

[21:20] <petdance> Is that the opinion of Perl 6 as a whole?

[21:20] <moritz> no

[21:20] <lizmat> fwiw: jberger used the worth "fiction", I used the word "argument"

[21:20] <moritz> jut as I'm pretty sure the Perl 5 community as a whole doesn't have a unified opinion

[21:20] <moritz> *just

[21:20] *** stmuk left
[21:20] *** zakharyas joined
[21:20] <petdance> fair enough, jberger said "fiction".

[21:21] <petdance> "necessary evil" is bad enough.

[21:21] <Scimon> I think all perl5 and perl6 devs can agree we prefer either to node ;)

[21:21] <moritz> personally, I think Perl 5 needs some radical changes, or obsolete itself over the next ~20 years or so

[21:21] <lizmat> yes, it is *evil* because it puts both Perl 5 and Perl 6 in a cul-de-sac

[21:21] <Scimon> (Scimon attempts to lighten the mood)

[21:21] <jberger> moritz: I would love to. How can we proceed? I'd like to know

[21:21] <El_Che> Scimon: how is that working out? :)

[21:21] *** espadrine joined
[21:22] <moritz> jberger: that's the catch. I don't see how it can, without sacrificing backwards compat

[21:22] <lizmat> petdance: it was necessary to prevent "civil war"

[21:22] <lizmat> at the time

[21:22] <moritz> jberger: on a purely technical level

[21:22] <petdance> But you didn't believe it.

[21:23] <lizmat> petdance: well, I'm allowed to have my own opinion, no?

[21:23] <jberger> moritz: to a first cut, I'd love to see a release in which strict and warnings are enabled by default (no strict; no warnings; would still allow backcompat) and hopefully similar for a few other warts

[21:23] <jberger> but I don't see how we can do that without a major version number

[21:23] <jberger> I'd also love to enable signatures and other such features

[21:23] <moritz> jberger: how would a major version number help?

[21:23] <petdance> I feel betrayed today.

[21:23] <jberger> give new users the sane defaults that we all use

[21:24] <jberger> moritz: semver

[21:24] <lizmat> petdance: but now, the "sister language" meme is working against Perl 5 and Perl 6

[21:24] <moritz> jberger: I don't see how that answers the question

[21:24] <jberger> we

[21:24] <jberger> sorry

[21:24] <moritz> jberger: do you mean, invoking the perl interpreter through different names?

[21:24] <lizmat> petdance: and it's working more against Perl 5 than Perl 6

[21:24] <lizmat> petdance: I'm sorry you feel betrayed

[21:24] *** cpup joined
[21:24] <El_Che> the sister thing was a compromise for the lack of compromise on the naming problem

[21:25] <petdance> Why not let the Perl 5 folks decide what's best for Perl 5?

[21:25] <jberger> nm, sorry, I can't right now. too much work

[21:25] <moritz> jberger: because otherwise you still either don't have a sane default or break back compat

[21:25] <lizmat> petdance: who is saying that they shouldn't ?

[21:25] <moritz> jberger: ok

[21:26] <moritz> jberger: feel free to point me to an explanation when you have more time

[21:26] <petdance> "it's working more against Perl 5 than Perl 6"

[21:26] <Scimon> I'm still confused about this idea that Perl5 people and Perl6 people are different. 

[21:26] <lizmat> petdance: I've expressed my ideal world: p5p becoming Porters again

[21:26] <petdance> Let Perl 5 decide if that's the case.

[21:26] <lizmat> petdance: with Perl 5, do you mean p5p ?

[21:26] <petdance> Here's my bottom line: I can't support a project that wants to replace another one.

[21:27] <petdance> And what I read in Liz's post is "P5 needs to go"

[21:27] <TEttinger> I got the exact opposite impression

[21:27] <lizmat> petdance: I'm sorry you read that into that

[21:27] *** lowin left
[21:27] <petdance> Please stop with the BS "I'm sorry"s.

[21:27] <TEttinger> emphasizing stability is saying it needs to _stay_

[21:27] <kraih> lizmat: your module porting effort will not be particularly successful, it will only alienate the Perl 5 community further

[21:28] <El_Che> petdance: isn't it a little early to look for a unified project stance? At the moment we're talking about 1 open letter

[21:28] <Scimon> kraih: Why do you say that?

[21:28] <petdance> That's why I asked my question.

[21:28] *** stmuk joined
[21:28] *** sena_kun left
[21:28] <geekosaur> I am starting to think a lot of people can't read for comprehension

[21:28] <petdance> If you'll recall, I asked at the very beginning if that's the stance of Perl 6 as a whole.

[21:29] <geekosaur> petdance, as I read it, lazmat is saying p5p's attitude is killing perl 5 and that needs to change

[21:29] <moritz> petdance: yes, and I've answered that, twice

[21:29] <geekosaur> yoiu, and some others don;'t seem to be able to read very well

[21:29] <geekosaur> or you prefer to believe that lizmat said something else

[21:29] <kraih> lizmat: if you're aiming for a positive outcome you'd have to bring the communities closer together, make v5 actually work

[21:29] <petdance> moritz: I know you have.  I was replying to El_Che.

[21:29] <lizmat> kraih: as I said in my blog post: that's something I would like to see happen

[21:30] <lizmat> but I also realized it may be too soon for it, because Perl 5 us *also* a set of modules that would need to be ported

[21:30] <El_Che> The emotions are fresh, let agree not to burn all bridges on the first day?

[21:30] <lizmat> which you could argue, is actually a prerequisite for the success of making "v5" work

[21:30] <moritz> El_Che: +1

[21:31] <El_Che> most people know each other for years here

[21:31] <geekosaur> personally I think the perl 5 core has been throttling perl 5 to death since *before* perl 6

[21:31] *** stmuk_ left
[21:31] <geekosaur> this is not perl 6's fault, this is a rotten perl 5 core that needs to be replaced with people who actually care about perl 5

[21:31] <lizmat> petdance: if anything, I wanted to be a "amicus curiae" to p5p when I said I would like to see them become Porters again

[21:32] <moritz> geekosaur: you make it sound like p5p doesn't care about p5, which is certainly not the case

[21:32] <kraih> geekosaur: perl 6 is what's harming perl 5 the most, it comes up in every single argument i ever have about perl with people from other language communities

[21:32] <petdance> It's all people ask about.

[21:32] <geekosaur> kraih, "it comes up in" yes this sis 100% proof

[21:32] <geekosaur> ok, yes, stupid people are oin fact God

[21:32] <lizmat> kraih: ok, given that Perl 6 is not going to go away, or be renamed

[21:32] <dylanwh> the peopel confused by perl6 and perl5 are not stupid.

[21:33] <lizmat> kraih: how do you see things moving forward then?

[21:33] <El_Che> geekosaur: let's moderate the tone. Calling users stupid does not help. It's something people experience (I have)

[21:33] <TEttinger> just as an outsider (I use neither perl5 nor perl6), I've seen some rude phrasing on one... make that both camps. maybe try to bring the civility up a notch

[21:33] <lizmat> TEttinger++

[21:33] <Scimon> TEttinger++

[21:33] <Scimon> It's all getting a bit crazy in here. 

[21:34] <kraih> lizmat: i've been part of the rename Perl 6 camp since like 2008

[21:34] <lizmat> petdance: suppose the CPAN Butterfly Plan works out, wouldn't that actually give you some arguments to all of the people that ask you about perl ?

[21:34] <moritz> kraih: fwiw I have quite a different impression on what's hurting Perl 5: sigils, coercive semantics (which many people don't seem to like), lack of signatures, lack of a good threading option, performance

[21:34] <Scimon> I've never had a manager tell me I can't write a project in Perl because of Perl6. I HAVE had then tell me because I should use Jave, or Node, or Python because Perl is dead. But Perl6 is never on their radar. 

[21:34] *** traxex joined
[21:34] <moritz> kraih: weird OO, and so on

[21:35] <lizmat> suppose we would have a functioning Butterfly Perl 5, wouldn't that strengthen your argument to keep / start using Perl 5 ?

[21:35] *** klapperl left
[21:36] *** klapperl joined
[21:36] <El_Che> Butterfly Perl and Rakudo Perl could work. "Butterfly Perl 5" is recreating the same naming problem... again

[21:37] <kraih> moritz: by all accounts Perl 5 is a much more successful language than Perl 6

[21:37] <Scimon> Yup. 

[21:37] <TEttinger> after 30 years I'd hope so

[21:37] <kraih> so it can't just be about features

[21:37] <moritz> kraih: that's not the point you were making earlier, and not the one I'm addressing now

[21:37] *** wamba joined
[21:38] <Scimon> Nope 30 years of use with little competition at the start might have something to do with it.

[21:38] *** Kaiepi left
[21:38] <Scimon> Anyway. I was going to bed. 

[21:38] <TEttinger> heh, absolutely

[21:38] <lizmat> Scimon: good night!

[21:38] <Scimon> Night all. Be nice. 

[21:38] <TEttinger> comparing early perl to other tools at the same time must have been night-and-day

[21:38] <kraih> moritz: but by your argument Perl 6 should be much more successful

[21:38] <El_Che> bye Scimon 

[21:38] *** Scimon left
[21:39] <moritz> kraih: no

[21:39] <kraih> lizmat: why tap into the perl 5 market at all, why not python?

[21:39] <El_Che> I repeat what I said earlier: at the moment we're all loosing.

[21:40] <kraih> why not port python modules?

[21:40] <petdance> I think all projects would be well-served by not trying to claim what's best for other projects.

[21:40] <TEttinger> ...

[21:41] <TEttinger> that's a contradiction, what you just said

[21:41] <moritz> it's not as if projects had singular voices and could claim anything

[21:41] *** Kaiepi joined
[21:41] <El_Che> well, if you want both projects to proper going back to an status quo won't cut it this time (or maybe it will, but we will be at the same place in a few years)

[21:41] <moritz> or as if lizmat's participation in Perl 6 would exclude her from the Perl 5 community, and forbid her to say things about Perl 5

[21:42] <petdance> It's frustrating to hear someone on Perl 6 say "We should do such-and-such, and it will help Perl 5, too"

[21:42] <moritz> petdance: please remember that lizmat is a perl 5 person too

[21:42] <petdance> I do know that.

[21:42] *** setty1 left
[21:42] <petdance> I wasn't talking about her in specific.

[21:43] <moritz> then what *are* you talking about?

[21:47] <Zoffix> "I think tyil and Zoffix are working on that?" No, I'm not. As I explicitly said in https://rakudo.party/post/CPAN6-Is-Here I started the ball rolling, but I won't have time to continue

[21:48] <Zoffix> It may have been a mistake to make the site in Perl 5. Just not enough volunteers who know the language and personally coding in it is just "work" not "fun" to me, so I'm not motivated at all.

[21:48] <petdance> lizmat has said that she doesn't buy into the idea of Perl 6 and Perl 5 co-existing.

[21:49] <kraih> lizmat: i still remember when there were plans to just embed perl5 in perl6

[21:49] <moritz> kraih: that has happend, with Inline::Perl5

[21:49] <petdance> So it's hard to take seriously claims of wanting to help Perl 5.

[21:49] <moritz> petdance: so if your statements about frustration weren't about lizmat, who were they about?

[21:50] *** rindolf left
[21:50] <petdance> Now that I think about it, it includes her.

[21:50] <moritz> kraih: it just happens to be a PITA to deploy anything that uses Inline::Perl5

[21:50] <moritz> ...

[21:50] *** dct joined
[21:50] <kraih> doesn't sound impossible to solve

[21:51] <petdance> And it also makes it hard for me to want to support Perl 6.

[21:51] <lizmat> petdance: I'm sorry you can't take me seriously ( and I'm not sorry for having used I'm sorry again)

[21:51] <jnthn> moritz: What makes it a pain, out of curoisity?

[21:52] <jnthn> (I haven't tried yet, though will likely have to in the not too distant future... :))

[21:52] <moritz> jnthn: needing correct versions of perl 5 and perl 6 and their modules

[21:52] *** leedo left
[21:52] <moritz> and each on is own is already kinda painful

[21:52] <lizmat> petdance: I've invested roughly 17 years of my life in Perl 5 only

[21:53] <moritz> I wouldn't even begin to know how to do that, except with some kind of container format, like Docker

[21:53] <lizmat> petdance: I think I can also say that Perl 5 wouldn't be in the position it is now because of me

[21:53] <kraih> making Inline::Perl5 work well seems way more productive than porting Perl 5 modules randomly

[21:54] <petdance> lizmat: OK, and?

[21:54] <kraih> interoperate, bring the communities together

[21:54] <kraih> instead of this hostile shit lizmat is starting

[21:54] <Zoffix> lizmat++ for stirring the pot and talking about the elephant in the room :)_Gonna knock up a few modules for Buttefly Project some time in the future

[21:54] <kraih> sorry, i'm getting a little upset

[21:54] <kraih> time to cool off

[21:55] <Zoffix> I'm a bit burnt out on humans, so I'll sit this one out, as far as discussions go \o

[21:55] <moritz> petdance: you see, cross-community advice isn't just a one way street. I find it frustrating too, at times

[21:55] *** Zoffix left
[21:55] <El_Che> kraih: Inline::Perl is a no go for deployment for me. No way to maintain 2 stacks (and the debugging headaches) on 1 project

[21:55] <petdance> Really, I think my questions have been answered.

[21:55] <lizmat> petdance: and the answer is ?

[21:55] <El_Che> (I know a lot of perl 6 people disagree with me on that)

[21:56] <El_Che> petdance: please remember about the no burning bridges on the first day. Everyone has a lot to digest

[21:56] <lizmat> petdance: do you think my blog post was written on a whim?

[21:56] <petdance> No.

[21:57] <lizmat> fwiw, I've been working on it for nearly a month, and had ~ 20 people (mostly Perl 5) preview it

[21:57] <petdance> lizmat: Do you think Perl 5 and Perl 6 can coexist?

[21:57] <petdance> Do you want that to happen?

[21:58] <lizmat> I have taken *all* of their comments and suggestions into review, and rewrote once from scratch, and finessed significantly before publication

[21:58] *** Ven`` left
[21:58] <lizmat> I believe Perl 5 and Perl 6 as *languages* can co-exist

[21:58] <petdance> But?

[21:58] <lizmat> I believe that perl5 as a runtime is come to the end of its life

[21:58] <lizmat> *has

[21:59] <El_Che> lizmat: isn't it to p5p to prove you right/wrong?

[21:59] <lizmat> I would *love* to be proven wrong about the longevity of the perl5 runtime

[21:59] <lizmat> but the signs are *not* favourable

[22:00] <lizmat> fwiw, I *am* subscribed to p5p and follow the discussions there

[22:01] <lizmat> petdance: or do you think I'm wrong about that ?

[22:01] <El_Che> lizmat: I don't think some perl5 people blame you because you see p5p as doomed, but because your letter may be interpreted as wanting to accelerate that in order for people to migrate to 6

[22:01] <petdance> I don't have an opinion one way or the other.

[22:01] <petdance> Yes yes yes.

[22:02] <petdance> "wanting to accelerate that in order for people to migrate to 6"

[22:02] <petdance> El_Che++

[22:02] <lizmat> eh, let me get this right ?

[22:02] *** Ven`` joined
[22:02] <El_Che> (notice the "interpretation" part)

[22:02] <lizmat> so we agree that perl5 as a runtime is doomed ?

[22:03] <petdance> No, I don't agree or disagree about the perl5 runtime.

[22:03] <petdance> I'm saying that what I read in your post is that you want Perl 5 as it is to die.

[22:03] <lizmat> that feels strange coming from such a Perl 5 supporter ?

[22:04] <lizmat> I want Perl (note the absence of a version there) to *live* a long life

[22:04] <lizmat> that means Perl 5 and Perl 6 as languages

[22:04] <lizmat> if had wanted Perl 5 dead, I would have taken a different set of actions

[22:05] <lizmat> like not organizing Perl events anymore, or manning Perl booths, or sponsoring events

[22:05] <El_Che> lizmat: I know you personally and I know how much you care (and how many years you have been thinking of this), so I would interprete it like that. But I certainly understand some people will.

[22:05] <lizmat> note again: no version there

[22:05] <El_Che> "so I wouldn't"

[22:05] <El_Che> (I meant)

[22:05] *** markong joined
[22:06] <lizmat> petdance: so if you look at this "commercially"

[22:06] <lizmat> petdance: I think investments into new features on the perl5 runtime, are bad investments

[22:06] <lizmat> petdance: I think investments into maintenance and efficiency improvements of the perl5 runtime are good investments

[22:07] <petdance> Those investments cost you nothing.

[22:07] <petdance> People work on what they want.

[22:07] <lizmat> if the perl5 runtime could be made 40% faster, that would mean several less datacenters to have fill at former $work

[22:07] <lizmat> petdance: only the people who don't get paid, work on what they want

[22:08] <moritz> good night all, try not to tear each others to shreds etc. :-)

[22:08] * El_Che off for a while. Keep the communication lines open, please.

[22:08] <lizmat> people getting paid to remove features from Perl 5 that were once *not* experimental, then became experimental

[22:08] <lizmat> and now not getting removed at all

[22:09] <lizmat> that's a bad investment

[22:40] <kraih> lizmat: my day job is mostly Perl 5

[22:41] <lizmat> I'm glad that's the case: there are many Perl 5 programmers out there that need to program in other languages for a living out of necessity

[22:42] <lizmat> Perl programmers that would *love* to be able to come back to programming Perl

[22:42] <lizmat> be that Perl 5 or Perl 6

[22:43] <lizmat> because they miss DWIM in other languages, and need to deal with too much WAT

[22:43] <kraih> in the Mojolicious community it's more often lack of applicants than jobs

[22:43] <kraih> we are all heavily employed

[22:44] *** wamba left
[22:44] <Phil21> lizmat: haha, I just asked jberger that exact question (porting mojo to python)

[22:44] <lizmat> Mojo is one of the reasons Perl 5 is being used extensively

[22:44] <Phil21> you started an office discussion :)

[22:45] <Phil21> yes, Mojo is the reason I was able to launch a Perl(5) project recently, as a semi-technical manager

[22:45] <lizmat> I think I've started discussions in many other places as well  :-)

[22:45] <lizmat> discussions are good: they make things clear(er)

[22:45] <Phil21> but man it's an uphill battle, which is what really makes me so curious why Perl 6 wants to keep the "perl" name since it seems to me as PHB it can only be a negative

[22:45] <Phil21> (aka whenever I say the word "Perl" minds close)

[22:46] *** Xliff joined
[22:46] <Xliff> \o

[22:46] *** dct joined
[22:46] <lizmat> the decision of Perl 6 keeping the Perl name was TimToady's

[22:46] <lizmat> and as benevolent dictator, he is by definition right  :-)

[22:46] <Phil21> fair enough

[22:46] <Xliff> Are there any console-based GUI libraries for P6?

[22:47] <Xliff> Something a little more high level than Ncurses.

[22:47] <kraih> at some point i was actually looking for a company to hire me to port Mojo to Perl 6, but there was very little interest

[22:48] <lizmat> Phil21: fwiw, as a long term goal I think we can (as a Perl community) reappropriate the Perl branc

[22:48] <lizmat> *brand

[22:48] <Phil21> lizmat: I hope so (really) but I've somewhat lost the faith in the last 6mo

[22:48] <lizmat> well, I've also seen the signs, and hope that my effort won't be too late

[22:49] <Phil21> agreed

[22:49] <Phil21> I certainly understand wanting a unified community

[22:49] <Xliff> kraih: Are you talking Mojo.js or another Mojo?

[22:49] <lizmat> and I think a unified Perl (supporting both Perl 5 and Perl 6) would be a USP in the world

[22:55] <Xliff> I think what I want is closer to Curses::UI (p5)

[22:56] <lizmat> kraih: have you had a look at Cro ?  http://mi.cro.services ?

[22:56] <Xliff> Which I may just use through Inline::Perl5 for now.

[23:00] <Xliff> Yeah. Curses::UI will do. Thanks, all.

[23:00] <kraih> lizmat: just briefly, but it doesn't appear to bring much new to the table
