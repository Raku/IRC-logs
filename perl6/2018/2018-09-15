[13:28] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v vike1

[13:29] <Zoffix> I don't know why we're being lazy with respect to all these private subs

[13:30] <leont> Sure, but given that there isn't any non-internal way to do this, I would still like it to keep working.

[13:30] <leont> Now working around it with a multi, but it's a bit unfortunate.

[13:30] <Zoffix> leont: "do this" is do what?

[13:30] <leont> Install a different argument parser

[13:31] <Zoffix> leont: and basically replace the MAIN_HELPER with a new sub?

[13:32] <leont> Yeah. I'm not even the first to do that.

[13:36] <Zoffix> Filed R#2279 if you have some example of what people are doing linked on that issue, to have a better idea of what the feature meant to allow that'd be great.

[13:38] <Zoffix> That's probably a viable workaround to call MAIN_HELPER in the meantime before and after that commit that modified it sig

[13:39] <Zoffix> There's no way to find caller's language version tho, so if the user is using 6.d that (0) would normally be (1), but you'd still be setting it to 0

[15:16] <timotimo> like a server on some vserver host, or there's probably hosters offering znc accounts, or a computer in your cupboard or something like that

[15:18] <mimododa> Hello, Perl

[15:18] *** Dollah left
[15:19] <mimododa> Is this the place I can ask some basic perl6 questions?

[15:19] *** sena_kun left
[15:20] <tobs> mimododa: absolutely

[15:21] <mst> there are many places where you *can* ask, but this is the place where you *should* :D

[15:22] <mimododa> I installed Rokudo latest version using brew install. and I was running the example from https://docs.perl6.org/language/101-basics in my MacBook;

[15:22] <mimododa> I got some errors: Cannot resolve caller split(Any, Str); Routine does not have any candidates. Is only the proto defined?   in block <unit> at wlist.pl line 12

[15:23] <mimododa> It seemed my perl6 complained the syntax...

[15:24] <timotimo> actually, it looks like a broken error message for the fact that $result doesn't have the expected contents?

[15:24] <timotimo> m: say Any.split(":")

[15:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed9b48de6: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot resolve caller split(Any, Str); Routine does not have any candidates. Is only the proto defined?‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[15:24] <timotimo> m: say "Hello:World".split(":")

[15:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed9b48de6: OUTPUT: ¬´(Hello World)‚ê§¬ª

[15:24] <timotimo> m: say Str.split(":")

[15:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed9b48de6: OUTPUT: ¬´Cannot resolve caller split(Str: Str); none of these signatures match:‚ê§    (Str:D: Regex:D $pat, $limit is copy = Inf;; :$v is copy, :$k, :$kv, :$p, :$skip-empty, *%_)‚ê§    (Str:D: Cool $match;; :$v is copy, :$k, :$kv, :$p, :$skip-empty, *%_)‚ê§   ‚Ä¶¬ª

[15:25] <timotimo> so your input file perhaps doesn't have a | in one of the lines, or maybe it's reading na empty line at the end of the file

[15:25] <timotimo> either way, something like "next without $result" to skip the rest of the code if $result is undefined should help

[15:25] <mimododa> ohhh, let me double check

[15:26] <timotimo> c: 2018.01 say Any.split(":")

[15:26] <committable6> timotimo, ¬¶2018.01: ¬´Cannot resolve caller split(Any, Str); Routine does not have any candidates. Is only the proto defined?‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/WUf6I_Mf_x line 1‚ê§‚ê§ ¬´exit code = 1¬ª¬ª

[15:26] <timotimo> didn't that error change recently?

[15:26] <committable6> timotimo, https://gist.github.com/2f111a442d5494d12db756d2a5798fd4

[15:26] <mimododa> say Any.split(":") Badly placed ()'s.

[15:27] <timotimo> i don't think it's good to have the "is only the proto defined?" error for a sub from the core setting

[15:31] <timotimo> could you put a dd $line, $pairing, $result; after the $p1, $p2 line?

[15:31] <timotimo> then we can see what's going wrong

[15:32] <mimododa> ok, let me try

[15:34] <timotimo> aha, there is indeed an empty line there

[15:34] <timotimo> and that's where it explodes

[15:34] *** Summertime joined
[15:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Summertime

[15:34] <mimododa> oops, then I should remove the empty line?

[15:34] <timotimo> either that, or you can add some condition to reject lines that aren't proper

[15:35] <timotimo> for example, right after -> $line { you can put "next unless $line.contains('|') && $line.contains(':')"

[15:35] <timotimo> or "next unless $line.chars > 0" (which can be shortened to just "next unless $line")

[15:35] <timotimo> which rejects only completely empty lines

[15:36] <timotimo> and by reject i mean skip processing

[15:36] <mimododa> great!!!! it works!

[15:36] <timotimo> \o/

[15:36] <mimododa> thanks for the help. 

[15:36] <timotimo> maybe something about this should also be added to the tutorial

[15:37] <timotimo> if you want, you can open a ticket on github; i'll be afk for like half an hour, and if you prefer i can open one then

[15:37] <mimododa> @timotimo great analysis and suggestion. my copy-paste adds an extra blank line

[15:38] <timotimo> it's likely that other users will also experience the same issue you saw

[20:00] <ccc> I'm trying to debug a module. When I use perl6-debug-m on a script that uses my module, it doesn't step into method calls when using enter

[20:00] <timotimo> ah, yes, it relies on compiling the code with a different compiler that puts in extra hooks to the code

[20:00] <timotimo> if you prevent it from using a precompiled blob, it'll let you step into module code as well

[20:01] <timotimo> the easiest way to get that is probably to change a line (add a comment or so) to the module's source code

[20:01] <ccc> How do I prevent it from using a precompiled blob

[20:05] <timotimo> we'd prefer getting long pieces of output via a pastebin-like service

[20:05] <timotimo> IRC is quite bad at handling many lines at once

[20:06] <ccc> sorry, but I don't remember how to do that (I've not used IRC in a long time)

[20:06] <timotimo> you'd go to a pasting website, put your stuff in, and the site would give you an URL that you can paste into IRC

[20:08] <ccc> This message is what I got earlier when I replaced the "use Mymod;" with the source from Mymod.pm6

[20:08] <geekosaur> or if you use somethng like irccloud or I think matrix.org, you paste it all into a singlemessage and the gateway makes a paste for you and sends that here

[20:08] <timotimo> i wonder if something in the perl6 grammar has significantly changed and the debugger needs to change its derived grammar to match?

[20:09] <ccc> I checked github for the module it's based on and there have been no issues for over a year

[20:09] *** leont left
[20:10] <timotimo> i don't think it gets used very frequently

[20:10] <ccc> my  rakudo star was installed on Sep 4

[20:10] <ccc> People aren't eating their own dogfood?

[20:10] <timotimo> i myself am working on a debugger based on a completely different approach. it's not as far along as the existing one, but it lets you even step around in precompiled stuff

[20:11] <timotimo> the perl6-debug-m one also doesn't support multithreading properly

[20:11] <timotimo> since people tend to build apps with asynchrony and multithreading nowadays, the usefulness is limited

[20:11] <ccc> timotimo: Ok Godspeed on your debugger replacement

[20:12] <timotimo> thanks. there's a little bit of reading about it online if you're interested

[20:15] <timotimo> perhaps; i'd say the issue would go in the rakudo repository, since that's where the grammar is implemented

[20:38] <Xliff> What's the best way to get a piece of code to run automatically after self.bless()?

[20:38] <Xliff> This is WITHOUT using BUILD or TWEAK

[20:39] <timotimo> override the bless method

[20:39] <timotimo> alternatively, manipulate the BUILDALLPLAN

[20:41] <Xliff> m: class A { method new { my $a = self.bless(); dothat; $a; }; method dothat { &?ROUTINE.name.say; }; }; my $a = A.new; $a.^name.say;

[20:42] <Xliff> ^^ Or that?

[20:42] *** MilkmanDan left
[20:42] <timotimo> do be aware that the "self.dothat" is actually run on the type object, not the object you just created

[20:42] <Xliff> So I'd still need to override bless?

[20:42] <timotimo> no

[20:42] <timotimo> you can $a.dothat

[20:42] <Xliff> Ahh!

[20:43] *** OrangeBacon left
[20:43] <timotimo> if other classes inherit from A, they will not get the same behaviour if they have their own method "new"

[20:43] <Xliff> m: class A { method new { my $a = self.bless(); $a.dothat; $a; }; method dothat { ::?CLASS ~ "." ~ &?ROUTINE.name.say; }; }; my $a = A.new; $a.^name.say;

[20:53] <Xliff> timotimo: What does tha basic implementation of bless() look like?

[20:53] <Xliff> Are ther docs on that, or is there just code?

[20:54] <moritz> I'm pretty the documentation on object construction methods that bless calls CREATE and BUILDALL

[20:54] <timotimo> i think CREATE doesn't exist, it's just nqp::create

[20:55] <lizmat> m: dd Str.CREATE

[20:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8fcebb861: OUTPUT: ¬´""‚ê§¬ª

[20:55] <lizmat> it does exist

[20:55] <lizmat> :-)

[20:55] <Xliff> :)

[20:55] <timotimo>     method bless(*%attrinit) {

[20:55] <timotimo>         nqp::create(self).BUILDALL(Empty, %attrinit);

[20:55] <timotimo>     }

[20:55] <timotimo> OK

[20:55] <timotimo> but method bless uses nqp::create rather than self.CREATE

[20:55] <Xliff> What file was that in? I was looking for it.

[20:55] *** rindolf left
[20:55] <timotimo> Mu.pm6

[20:56] <lizmat> timotimo: the reason it says nqp::create there, is to avoid another method call

[20:56] *** leont left
[20:56] <timotimo> OK

[20:57] <Xliff> Thanks, everyone.

[20:57] <timotimo> sure

[20:57] <jnthn> I suspect with inlining that matters rather less than it used to. That said, .CREATE should probably be macro-like and just compile into nqp::create.
