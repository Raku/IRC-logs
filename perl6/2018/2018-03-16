[06:21] <bocaneri> How do you make perl6 ignore "malformed UTF-8"? As soon as a file read hits it, the IO object stops reading anything more.

[06:25] <tobs> bocaneri: if you're reading a binary file, set :bin?

[06:25] <bocaneri> It's not bin. Log files from hexchat.

[08:41] <moritz> m: sub f($x, :$y, :$z) { }; say &f.signature.params.grep(*.named)

[08:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar dffbd68a7: OUTPUT: «((y) (z))␤»

[08:42] <masak> Kaiepi: terminology nitpick: in the declared sub/method, they are "parameters". when you pass in values in a call, they are "arguments"

[08:42] <moritz> m: class A { method f($x, :$y, :$z) { } };say  A.^lookup('f').signature.params.grep(*.named).map(*.named_names)

[08:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar dffbd68a7: OUTPUT: «((y) (z) ())␤»

[08:42] <moritz> Kaiepi: ^^ like this?

[08:42] <masak> the CS world (and much of non-Perl) calls them "formal parameters" and "actual parameters", respectively. for some reason. I'm kind of fond of "arguments".

[08:43] <moritz> .oO( we can have arguments about that all day long :-)

[08:43] <masak> heh, I used that pun in an advent post once ;)

[08:43] <masak> moritz: why did we get a `()` above?

[08:43] <moritz> masak: around each name?

[08:44] <moritz> because there can be more than one

[08:44] <moritz> it's a list

[08:44] <Kaiepi> not really, i'm looking for a way to pass the method's name arguments to an exception for it to print

[08:44] <moritz> m: class A { method f($x, :y(:$long_y), :$z) { } };say  A.^lookup('f').signature.params.grep(*.named).map(*.named_names)

[08:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar dffbd68a7: OUTPUT: «((long_y y) (z) ())␤»

[08:44] <Kaiepi> *named

[08:44] <masak> yes, but you filtered out the $x, did you not

[08:44] <Kaiepi> but i don't know which ones it will get passed

[08:44] <masak> so why are there three still, and why is the third empty

[08:44] *** aindilis` left
[08:45] <moritz> masak: huh, good question

[08:45] <moritz> m: class A { method f($x, :y(:$long_y), :$z) { } };say  A.^lookup('f').signature.params.grep(*.named).elems

[08:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar dffbd68a7: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[08:45] <moritz> masak: oh, the implicit *%_

[08:45] <masak> oh!

[08:45] <masak> because it's a method

[08:45] <masak> right

[08:45] <moritz> m: class A { method f($x, :y(:$long_y), :$z) { } };say  A.^lookup('f').signature.params.grep(*.named)[*-1]

[08:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar dffbd68a7: OUTPUT: «*%_␤»

[08:45] <masak> after 14 years with Perl 6, I still find the implicit *%_ constantly surprising ;)

[08:45] <masak> I know rationally why it's there

[08:46] <masak> and I buy that it's a valid argument (no pun intended)

[08:46] <masak> but it still surprises me

[08:46] <masak> I blame inheritance. inheritance sucks.

[08:58] <jkramer> In a multi method, how can I do a where on self? Something like multi method Str(Int:D $_ where * == 2) { ... } (in a augment class Int for example)

[09:01] <moritz> multi method Str(Int:D: SELF where { SELF == 2 }) { ... }

[09:01] <moritz> the : after the type is the magic sauche

[09:02] <jkramer> Ah right, I didn't know where to place it when there's a where involved.

[09:02] <jkramer> Thanks!

[09:03] <jkramer> m: use MONKEY-TYPING; augment class Int { multi method Str(Int:D: SELF where { SELF == 2 }) { 'foo' } }; .say for ^5

[12:07] <pmurias> re removing Perl 5 warning instead of getting rid of them completly wouldn't it make more sense to just turn them into suggestions what might be wrong instead of stuff that disallows legal code?

[12:08] <masak> jkramer: did you expect a different result? an evenly distributed random non-negative integer, say?

[12:09] <jkramer> masak: I'm not really sure what I expected, just found the result curious. :) But I guess it makes sense somehow, picking a random thing from an infinite list is tricky

[12:10] <jkramer> Probably should be mentioned in the docs though

[12:10] <El_Che> the answer could be blocking like and take forever

[12:12] <jnthn> .oO( See how much RAM the system has and then pick the largest upper bound we can with enough working space and... :P )

[12:12] <yoleaux> 06:58Z <nine_> jnthn: On the issue of `composalizable` and `inheritalizable` I'm firmly in the "brilliant use of English derivational morphology" camp. But then, I'm native German speaker, so I'm used to torturing words ;)

[12:12] <yoleaux> 10:47Z <nine_> jnthn: What do you thing about this patch giving us reproducible nqp builds? With it a simple make clean && make install without changes won't break an installed rakudo anymore. https://gist.github.com/niner/c82676810ce4fb2d4aee50e0ef086ef6

[12:12] <jkramer> m: my @foo = lazy gather { loop { take 100000.rand.Int } }; @foo.pick.say

[12:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Cannot .pick from a lazy list␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:12] <jkramer> Maybe (^Inf).pick should throw the same error instead of returning Nil?

[12:13] <jkramer> (^Inf) is a lazy list, isn't it?

[12:13] <masak> jkramer: it's not "picking a random thing from an infinite list" *as such* that's tricky. if that were the only problem, we'd probably be fine

[12:13] <jnthn> .tell nine Goodness, that's a tiny patch to achieve such a thing! Can't think of an objection :)

[12:13] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to nine.

[12:13] <jnthn> lunch &

[12:13] <masak> jkramer: it's more like, the probability of each number being picked is 0, or at best infinitesimal

[12:14] <jkramer> m: (^Inf).eager.head(10).say

[12:14] <masak> jkramer: worse, for any number N you picked, it's infinitely unlikely that you picked that one instead of a bigger one

[12:14] <jkramer> Oopsie :D

[12:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «(timeout)»

[12:14] <masak> most non-negative integers are simply unfathomably, ridiculously huge

[12:14] <jkramer> masak: True, makes sense

[12:15] <masak> somewhere out there is a positive integer whose digits encode your entire life in stupendously fine detail

[12:15] <jkramer> But if (^Inf) is a lazy list, shouldn't (^Inf).roll fail with the same error as the example above?

[12:16] <masak> m: say (^Inf).roll

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[12:16] <jkramer> (or pick)

[12:16] <masak> m: say (^Inf).pick

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[12:16] <masak> LGTM

[12:16] <masak> or, well. I guess Perl 6 could be more strict than that, and throw an exception.

[12:16] <masak> but Perl has a tradition of being lenient, for better or worse

[12:18] <jkramer> I mean wouldn't it be more consistent if (^Inf) and the example above would behave the same? Given they're both lazy lists

[12:18] <jkramer> m: my @foo = lazy gather { loop { take 100000.rand.Int } }; @foo.pick.say

[12:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Cannot .pick from a lazy list␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:18] <[Coke]> ^Inf isn't a lazy list, though, is it?

[12:18] <[Coke]> m: (^Inf).^name.say

[12:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Range␤»

[12:18] <masak> no, it's a range

[12:18] <[Coke]> ^^

[12:18] <jkramer> Ah

[12:19] <masak> which is what I meant by, it's not a problem in itself to pick things from a very large range

[12:19] <jkramer> Ok now I get it :)

[12:19] <masak> because we can just use the endpoints and straightforward math

[12:19] <jkramer> m: (^Inf).list.pick.say

[12:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 51c4d4d89: OUTPUT: «Cannot .pick from a lazy list␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:20] <jkramer> Yeah that was my fault, I was somehow thinking (^Inf) was an infinite list of integers, not a range

[12:22] <El_Che> jkramer: there is no fault on Perl 6, only git blame

[15:45] <nine> My Linux installation on this computer is older than some of my interns...

[15:46] <El_Che> do you move disk images around of is you pc 17y old?

[15:46] <El_Che> (and if so, have you tried to compile rakudo? :) )

[15:47] <nine> The PC itself is even older than 17 years. But I don't think any individual part is that old anymore :) So yes, I replace disks but not the contents.

[16:18] <nige> hi - just wanted to share a list of branding suggestions for Perl 6 - http://nigelhamilton.com/perl-branding-proposal.html#suggestions

[16:18] <nige> please take this in the intended spirit - the more the merrier

[16:18] <nige> and of course TimToady is at liberty to select none

[16:20] <nige> if you would like add one to the list - please email me nige (at) nigelhamilton.com

[16:20] <moritz> I can't say I like any of them very much, but I do appreciate the effort and thought

[16:21] <nige> thanks moritz - that's a fair comment - I'm not in love with any either

[16:21] *** mcmillhj left
[16:24] <El_Che> nige: my favorite one is not on the list :(

[16:26] *** Zoffix joined
[16:26] <Zoffix> nige: 6lang isn't my suggestion, it was AlexDaniel++'s

[16:26] *** psychoslave left
[16:26] <nige> that's fine El_Che - you can always suggest one ;-)

[16:26] <nige> Zoffix - shall I update with AlexDaniel instead?

[16:27] <El_Che> nige: it isn't a popular one because of reasons, but it's the only one that doesn't suck ;) : Rakudo

[16:27] <nige> OK - I'll add that too

[16:27] <Zoffix> nige: yeah. But if you want to list a suggestion from me, it's "Rakudo"

[16:28] <El_Che> For the record, I find *all* the names in the list now terrible, but I would take any one of them to break the Perl 5 - 6 PR nightmare

[16:28] <Zoffix> Some commentary from Damian Conway's email: "Ideally the language itself would be "Rakudo" ("Way of the Camel") and the current implementation would be "Rokudo" ("Way of Six")"

[16:28] <El_Che> (list == as of now, I love the Rakudo name)

[16:28] <Zoffix> nige: Damian also lists a few more, like "Zeta": https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/522abeb84debe64041ea70afeebc058a

[16:29] <nige> ok - updated the list

[16:29] <Zoffix> I like Rakudo 'cause it's already in use.

[16:30] <El_Che> zeta would result in not a lot of people from Mexico and ex-Mexican USA territories joining: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Zetas

[16:31] <El_Che> I like the tech advances, sophisticated, efficient part

[16:33] <Zoffix> nige: "can be used as an identifier in common languages" is also a good criteria to consider. It's why TimToady didn't like 6lang and why we had syntax highlights issues on GitHub for half a year

[16:33] <El_Che> MS 13 (mara salvatrucha 13) has more PR options though, great for starting talking at conferences: https://i1.wp.com/unitedgangs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_lx6quy_ye_lp1qfc2z3o1_500.jpg?fit=500%2C333&ssl=1

[16:33] <nige> looking up the trademark system TESS shows a lot of things happening for Zeta - need to look deeper there

[16:34] <nige> ok - can you have a Perl 6 identifier that starts with a number ? I though not.

[16:34] <nige> thought*

[16:34] <moritz> you can't

[16:35] *** epony left
[16:35] <El_Che> to me the 6lang name falls in the cute l33t names

[16:35] <El_Che> sounds extremely unprofessional

[16:36] <Zoffix> As opposed to "Go" or "D-Lang" or "Rust"? :)

[16:36] <nige> Ok - will add Zeta to the list too later and other suggestions from the Damian - need to be afk - can add more to list later - please email me nige (at) nigelhamilton.com if you would like more added

[16:37] <El_Che> Go and Rust have a bigger marketing budget and therefor name recognition. Haven't heard much of D though

[16:37] <Zoffix> m: my &term:<6lang> = {state $v}; 6lang = 42; say 6lang; 6lang = 100; say 6lang

[16:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0194ef46a: OUTPUT: «42␤100␤»

[16:38] <Zoffix> I started disliking "6lang" (with it's originally suggested pronunciation "Slang") when someone pointed out we our Slang feature would make talks about Slangs rather awful... "So Slang the language has Slang the feature...."

[16:39] <Zoffix> m: my &term:<6lang> = {$}; 6lang = 42; say 6lang; 6lang = 100; say 6lang

[16:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0194ef46a: OUTPUT: «42␤100␤»

[16:39] <El_Che> slang has bad association when related to languages

[16:40] <El_Che> throw perl into the mix...

[16:43] <Zoffix> .oO( Z-lang )

[18:02] *** pharv joined
[18:04] <cfa> and i agree, there's a bit of a circular problem at the moment: to validate the current mop design, we probably need to document things so that it's clear what can be used (and how); if we document what can be used, we effectively spec it.

[18:04] <cfa> but that was better said by jnthn in the ticket :)

[18:33] <Zoffix> .ask lizmat is it intentional that a bunch of subs lost their purity in this commit? They do come out faster on HEAD, but I wonder if `is pure` would give even more benefit https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/cdb45fa5a65f06b543db7939fc51af7b598e0bfb

[23:40] <Herby_> How can a programming novice contribute to Perl 6?

[23:43] <timotimo> finding problems with documentation is a big way

[23:44] <timotimo> i got my start in perl6 development writing tests for bug reports, iirc

[23:44] *** mcmillhj left
[23:44] <timotimo> depending on the bug it might take a bit more in-depth understanding that a novice might have, or maybe it's just the right amount of "unknown" for a good learing experience

[23:45] <Herby_> where do i go to view bug reports?

[23:46] <timotimo> buggable: testneeded

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> buggable: tag testneeded

[23:47] <buggable> AlexDaniel, There are 52 tickets tagged with TESTNEEDED; See http://fail.rakudo.party/t/TESTNEEDED for details

[23:47] <timotimo> ah, that's how!

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> yea, stupid bot

[23:48] <timotimo> that has been updated to also nom github issues, right?

[23:49] <AlexDaniel> not yet, github issues here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atestneeded

[23:49] <timotimo> good to know

[23:49] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/zoffixznet/r6/issues/11

[23:50] *** wamba joined
[23:50] <AlexDaniel> fwiw there are many LHF tickets there

[23:50] <timotimo> there's probably also a module you could write and publish that could help others, that can be an interesting and important experience

[23:50] <AlexDaniel> because dogbert++ marked a bunch as ｢testneeded｣

[23:51] <AlexDaniel> (and nobody looked at these tickets yet!)

[23:51] <timotimo> you could be the first human to look at these tickets! exciting!

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> well, the first human after dogbert added testneeded tag

[23:52] <timotimo> oh, so dogbert *is* a human?

[23:52] <timotimo> i suppose more bert than dog, then

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> I don't want to assume anything

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> … even though I did :P

[23:53] <timotimo> people do things they don't want to do all the time

[23:53] <Herby_> :)

[23:54] <timotimo> oh, and of course doing perl6 stuff publically is also a good way to help

[23:54] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:55] <timotimo> i should do more SDL2::Raw stuff with perl6 again

[23:55] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: also, maybe https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/ ?

[23:55] <timotimo> haven't done anything after the last bits of performance improvements have landed, i don't think

[23:56] <AlexDaniel> by the way, looking for suggestions for the next squashathon

[23:57] <AlexDaniel> I was thinking maybe whateverable, but we'll have to delay that for a bit (until tests stop segfaulting)

[23:58] <timotimo> Herby_: https://twitter.com/loltimo/status/904058942078246915  -  https://twitter.com/loltimo/status/904038390131286025  -  you think i should make more like this

[23:59] *** mcmillhj left
[23:59] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: thanks, i'll take a look

[23:59] <Herby_> timotimo: that is pretty cool. is the code posted somewhere?
