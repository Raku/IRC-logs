[00:00] <holyghost> basically you have a 16-bit system at the minimum then so you char array is doubled

[00:00] <timotimo> i remember some of that code! :)

[00:00] <holyghost> :-)

[00:01] <timotimo> so, where does the issue arise? from the decode method? or decode-part?

[00:03] <holyghost> 0xff = 16*15+15 I meant to say

[00:03] *** leont left
[00:03] <holyghost> 0xffff = 15*16^3 + 15*16^2 + 15*16^1 + 15

[00:04] *** ryn1x joined
[00:04] <Kaiepi> both encode and decode

[00:04] <timotimo> maybe store the original length and just cut it off after doing the calculations?

[00:05] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ryn1x

[00:07] <Kaiepi> ohh

[00:07] <Kaiepi> yeah i could do that

[00:07] <holyghost> my system does not use a length, to be honest

[00:08] <holyghost> you just encode a string as as number

[00:08] <timotimo> if you explicitly transport the length, your code will also accept things like null bytes in the middle

[00:09] <holyghost> right

[00:28] <hythm_> Hello, I only know how to write cli scripts,  what would be the way to go (module/framework) if I want to  learn to write a desktop app, where i can align squares together, flip, reverse positions,  swap, etc... may be this picture will explain better what I have in my mind https://goo.gl/images/wTZygK        

[00:29] <hythm_> The squares will have unicode characters 

[00:30] <timotimo> depending very much on how you want the input to go, it could be rather complicated

[00:31] <hythm_> The input will be set of symbols,,, basically i want to write a program to create the Zodiac cipher,, and be able to change, displace these symbols

[00:32] <timotimo> the easiest is perhaps GTK, like with GTK::Simple; GTK::Plus is a new module that's in development since not too long and i'm not sure what percentage of it already works; i think a lot?

[00:33] <timotimo> i don't know anything about that cypher

[00:35] <hythm_> This is a picture of the cipher http://www.zodiacciphers.com/uploads/4/9/7/1/4971630/340cipher_orig.gif

[00:35] <timotimo> you'd want to offer a bunch of pieces that the user could add to each character?

[00:37] *** leont left
[00:38] <hythm_> Im not sure, what im thinking (for now) is for example to select a subset of the symbols say 4x4,, or 6x8,, the flip or reverse this dubset,,, then draw the whole tjing again with the new position

[00:39] <timotimo> i know you can do this with SDL2, but then you'll have to roll your own UI stuff

[00:40] <hythm_> So i need to learn both GTK and SDL2 ? 

[00:40] <timotimo> no, it'd be one or the other

[00:40] <hythm_> Im sorry if the quetion does not make sense, this all new to me

[00:41] <timotimo> theoretically they combine, but not quite easily

[00:41] <timotimo> what does combine fine is GTK and Cairo

[00:42] <timotimo> cairo gives you drawing functions like "draw a line from here to there" or "draw an arc" or "fill this circle"

[00:42] <timotimo> and GTK gives you "put a row of buttons here" or "give me an input field" and "a menu bar at the top please"

[00:44] <timotimo> and to combine them you can tell GTK "put a big rectangular space here" and then Cairo "draw some stuff on this space"

[00:46] <hythm-> Thank you timo

[00:47] <timotimo> good luck!

[00:48] <timotimo> the SDL2 stuff is ... pretty raw. not very well documented on the perl6 side, but the SDL2 wiki translates very straight-forwardly if you know how NativeCall calls things from the C world

[00:51] <hythm-> Looks like I will need to learn a lot, but i don't mind, as learning with perl6 is ofun

[00:55] <timotimo> :) :)

[00:59] <holyghost> hythm-: look at github.com/theholyghost, search for PaganVisions2 directory and look at the SDL2::Raw stuff, I've made a window with drawing loop there

[01:00] <holyghost> inside one of the repos, Holly6Game I think

[01:00] <MasterDuke> i would love a good Perl6QT binding...

[01:00] <timotimo> wouldn't we all

[01:00] <holyghost> That's a monster to work on

[01:01] <hythm-> Thanks holyghost, will do

[02:33] <holyghost> ^-- there's ask and get routines now which should make you any Agent except for agent-to-agent dispatching

[02:34] <holyghost> that's for parsing parsers and shouldn't be too difficult

[02:35] <holyghost> although agents have a default "agent" message where you double dispatch them and do your own code (parsing) on them

[02:36] <holyghost> Agent is just an Actor with a dispatch routine for sending it messages (sync or async, depending on your further code on them

[02:42] <holyghost> Now I need an agent network system, I'll do that later on

[04:13] <holyghost> I've added 2 agents' databases with a microcode database (a hash of {"add.l" => opcode hex } for M68000 assembler and an empty one for NES assembler), if you parse with this inside an agent you can transform binaries with it e.g. automatic programming/genetic programming should write a binary file or another example you translate the game language inside the ROM's machine code, you can also dump rom offsets for e.g. ripping gra

[04:13] <holyghost> phics from rom files

[04:15] <holyghost> I still need to write the parsing methods for them, which takes a bit longer  ;-)

[04:18] <holyghost> Which is where my Bayes::Learn, Game::Markov and Mathx::Stat comes into play, if you want to make the agent learn something, needs an hidden markov model though

[07:06] <holyghost> I had to put in some legalese for the Perl6 crew and Perl6 users, you can ask Agent (derived) classes anything, but you have to know what you are deploying/disking. So always use the "ask" message on your Agent's dispatch method to see if you would deploy illegally.

[07:07] <holyghost> "ask about *text*" and "ask" just list Agent's databases

[07:08] <holyghost> So deploying "Faxanadu" Nintendo ROMs would be illegal unless you change it e.g. to support Nintendo

[07:08] <holyghost> you can translate it to Spanish for example, which hepls everyone

[07:08] <holyghost> Then send the agent to Nintendo ;-)

[10:40] <tyil> so many ways to solve things!

[10:40] <lizmat> hehe

[10:40] <tyil> I presume .indices is faster as it doesnt do a regex?

[10:41] <tyil> I like regexes, too bad they're still relatively slow in Perl 6

[10:41] <tyil> but good to know about .indices :)

[12:23] <moritz> because that's what pmichaud wrote years ago

[12:26] <masak> wasn't there an email group perl6-announce ?

[12:26] <moritz> there was

[12:27] <masak> then that wordage probably predates pmichaud's use, even

[12:29] <masak> maybe the names of the groups (which I think were formed around the time of the RFC process) were inspired by some other language community

[12:32] <isBEKaml> masak: wordage, heh

[12:33] <Zoffix> masak: the MAIN handler tries to figure out whether the defined MAIN can be called with the given arguments, but Block ain't got a .cando method

[12:38] <masak> Zoffix: thank you kindly.

[12:38] <masak> this happens to be a case where, 'cept for the lack of a .cando attitude on the part of the Block, that &MAIN would actually work since I passed in 0 arguments

[12:40] <masak> I'm pretty sure I know how blocks differ from routines, and I don't see any of those differences being in the way of giving blocks a .cando

[12:41] <masak> also, the method name "cando" is very silly in a way that feels almost compulsively Perl 6ish at this point, and by the way it looks like two words without a separator, like a hyphen or something

[12:42] <masak> but I'm not really out to clamor for changing it; making light fun of it is enough for my purposes ;)

[18:31] <jdv79> ah, so it is uding parts of the existing stuff

[18:31] <jdv79> what is the line length of these 500 lines?

[18:32] <Zoffix> I think you're misunderstanding what's being built.

[18:33] <jdv79> isnt it a "perl6 compiler"?

[18:34] <Zoffix> The premise of Roast is anything that can pass it can claim to be a Perl 6 compiler. That begs the question: how little can that compiler do in order to pass the test. Ignoring the most nonsensical answers (just output a single `1 - ok`), the base requirement is it must be capable of producing valid TAP output and for that TAP output to contain the correct number of tests present in roast. The rest is all

[18:34] <Zoffix> optional

[18:35] <Zoffix> So—presumably—and all it needs to do is able to figure out sub calls for a select number of subs and print " - ok" for all of them, with a test counter.

[18:35] <Zoffix> And the further that is from the truth, the stronger is the spec.

[19:29] <jdv79> what's an easy way to say "string exists in a key of hash"

[19:29] <jdv79> kinda like $str ~~ any(%h.keys) ?

[19:29] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:29] <jdv79> is htat right?

[19:30] <jdv79> but that's whole matches.  i want substring.

[19:30] *** AlexDaniel joined
[19:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v AlexDaniel

[19:31] <jnthn> I'd probably so something like ?%h.keys.grep(*.contains($str))

[19:39] <timotimo> no, that's whole matches again

[19:43] <lizmat> ah, I misinterpreted "$str ~~ any(%h.keys)"

[19:46] <lizmat> jdv79: then probably something like "with %h.keys.first(*.contains($str))"

[19:46] <lizmat> so it will short-circuit on the first match

[19:53] <jnthn> lizmat: grep in boolean context also will, no? :)

[19:56] <jdv79> actually its the opposite.  its the keys that are the substrings

[19:57] <lizmat> m: say so ^10 .grep: *.say   # jnthn, looks like  :)

[19:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 078b05f64: OUTPUT: «0␤True␤»

[20:01] <jdv79> "The use of hash variables in regexes is preserved."

[20:01] <jdv79> smells like a typo in the docs

[20:01] * jnthn likes pickles :)

[20:02] <jnthn> Should be reserved :)

[20:02] <jnthn> m: my %h; "foo" ~~ /%h/

[20:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 078b05f64: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤The use of hash variables in regexes is reserved␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my %h; "foo" ~~ /%h7⏏5/␤»

[20:02] <jnthn> At least it's correct there

[20:02] <jdv79> pickle reserves?

[20:02] <jdv79> so the var in the regex has to be explictily be an array (starts with @) to be interpolated as a alternation?

[20:03] <jnthn> Yes, but note that you can do @(%h.keys)

[20:04] <jdv79> ah.  i tried @{}.  been doing a lot of p5 lately.

[22:07] <Xliff> Is that due to a fact that the action class method is using ($/) as a parameter? What's the best way to work around that?

[22:24] <TimToady> ($/ is copy) is one way
