[12:05] <Altreus> The earlier line 81 says (0 READY) and then it says emit READY

[12:06] <Altreus> But then 81 gives me (0 GUILD_CREATE) and I never get emit GUILD_CREATE

[12:06] <squashable6> 🍕 JJ++ wrote a comment on “No books mentioned in Perl 6 documentation”: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2143#issuecomment-403211111

[12:07] <Altreus> yes

[12:07] <Altreus> if I add a say immediately below `when OPCODE::despatch`, I get it

[12:07] *** lizmat joined
[12:08] <El_Che> my wip branches are "Oh, I need to go home, so I'll commit anyway, no idea if it compiles at all" :)

[12:08] <Altreus> ah mine is "this doesn't work but I need to commit it"

[12:08] <Altreus> I've discovered that it simply stops at line 85

[12:09] <Altreus> but it stops there on every received message

[12:09] <Altreus> (with op 0)

[12:09] <Altreus> Do I need to handle something, in order to get an error? :s

[12:10] <timotimo> you're trying to .emit on the Supply rather than the Supplier?

[12:10] <El_Che> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/emit

[12:11] <El_Che> it looks like it need a Spupply or react block

[12:11] <timotimo> no, i don't think that's the right fix

[12:11] <El_Che> wouldn't it block?

[12:11] <Altreus> Line 85 seems to die if $payload<session_id> doesn't exist

[12:11] <Altreus> but with no error

[12:12] <Altreus> the supply/supplier pattern I thought I was borrowing from cro but I might have confused it

[12:13] <Altreus> I see what I've done wrong

[12:13] <timotimo> please put a CATCH { .say } somewhere in the outer level of handle-opcode

[12:13] <Altreus> cro has a lexical $receiver and a member $.receiver and one is a supplier and the other a supply

[12:13] <Altreus> ok :)

[12:13] <timotimo> you may only .emit on the supplier

[12:15] <Altreus> it is working :)

[12:15] <Altreus> let me try and trigger the CATCH I just added

[12:15] <Altreus> timotimo: the CATCH indeed outputs an error now

[12:16] <timotimo> you weren't using the result of the promise you're building with the .then

[12:16] <timotimo> so it just gets set to Broken and nothing looks at it

[12:16] <Altreus> ah yes, the body is a Promise

[12:16] <timotimo> i think a supply block might be much better for your case

[12:16] <Altreus> I didn't think of that

[12:16] <timotimo> kind of like El_Che suggested

[12:17] <timotimo> it'll be a bit more of a refactoring

[12:17] <timotimo> but it'll help handle errors

[12:17] <Altreus> I'm not sure I grok how to do it, but I'll add it as a fixme

[12:18] <Altreus> It might become clearer the more I write

[13:15] <tbrowder_> hi, anyone want to discuss Language page order and display?

[13:16] *** gabiruh left
[13:22] *** blackberry9900 joined
[13:23] <tbrowder_> i have a first-step solution to htmlify.p6 so the Language page titles and links are shown in page-order value order. if my upcoming PR is acceptable, the next steps, imo, are to (1) agree on some kind of grouping and titles of such, (2) create pod6 pages for the group titles, (3) edit each Language pod6 page, including the group title pages, to get the desired order, and (4) modify htmlify.p6 so page listings under a group

[13:23] <tbrowder_> title are rendered showing the child staus

[13:23] <tbrowder_> of the page.

[13:25] *** araraloren_ joined
[13:25] *** blackberry9900 left
[13:26] <tbrowder_> i suggest using page-order values of a00, b00, etc., for the group title pod6 pages, and child pages should have their page-order vales start with the same letter as their parent, and the other two digits for the desired order under the parent group.

[13:27] <MasterDuke> is there a way in git to see my most recent commit, regardless of what branch it was in and what branch i'm on now?

[17:16] <chienjo> Hi, is anyone else having a problem accessing https://rakudo.org/latest/star/source. Seems like there is problem with the certificate.

[17:17] *** Zoffix joined
[17:17] <Zoffix> chienjo: yeah, I just saw an Issue filed for that. Looking into it.

[17:17] <yoleaux> 10:14Z <araraloren> Zoffix: thanks, never seen that in the document

[17:19] <chienjo> Zoffix, Thank you.

[17:20] <Zoffix> moritz: you around?

[17:22] <Zoffix> moritz: in the last ~24hr rakudo.org ended up with generic perl6.org cert it seems. And certbot ain't installed on the server anymore. Do you know if anything changed or what we do for certs now?

[17:23] *** mcmillhj left
[17:25] <geekosaur> [07 06:50:03] <moritz> fun fact: perl6.org ssl files have been renewed by cron job as they should, but written to a different directory than what the apache config used for the SSL certs and keys

[17:57] <geekosaur> make sure that's not your browser?

[17:58] <timotimo> could be HSTS

[17:58] <timotimo> i.e. it remembers that the server told it to never try http again on this address

[17:58] <Zoffix> wget http://rakudo.org/.well-known/test.txt   fails too

[18:01] <moritz> Zoffix: I'll look into

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix++ moritz++

[18:04] <Zoffix> moritz: OK, here's as far as I got into it: the ./more-certs.sh didn't have rakudo.org listed, and it says "using blah blah for all unmatched domains" so I think it swapped the cert for rakudo.org for one of the default .perl6.org subdomains. So I edited more-certs to add -w /var/www/rakudo.perl6.org/webroot-rakudo.org/ -d rakudo.org \ but when I run it it tells me failed to get the challenge. I looked at

[18:04] <Zoffix> rakudo.org's apache conf and saw it doesn't set up neither webroot nor .well-known stuff (anymore? I thought we had it before) so I added Document root and well-known exclude cond in rakudo.org.conf in sites-available, but it's not picking it up. Even when I disabled rewrite engine, it still didn't pick it up

[18:05] <Zoffix> moritz: also, I accidentally hit the ratelimit, which looks to be like 20 per *week* ... oops

[18:05] <Zoffix> moritz: and they have a staging server for debugging. You can use with:    ./letsencrypt-auto --agree-tos --staging -n --webroot --renew-by-default --test-cert -w /var/www/rakudo.perl6.org/webroot-rakudo.org/ -d rakudo.org --email morits@teh-email.com certonly

[18:06] <Zoffix> (well, I used the proper email from more-certs)

[18:06] <moritz> Zoffix: I think I screwed up the symlinks in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled, and now they are all regular files

[18:06] <moritz> so if you edit /etc/apache2/sites-available, it doesn't take effect

[18:06] <moritz> I'll need to clean up that eventually

[18:06] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:06] <Zoffix> oh

[18:08] <Zoffix> moritz: oh and I also created .well-known dir and test.txt file inside /var/www/rakudo.perl6.org/webroot-rakudo.org/   (mentioning in case it'd interfere with whatever certbot does)

[18:08] <Zoffix> There's also an open Issue for this issue: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/issues/14

[18:14] <uzl> Does the way the types are arranged in this cheat sheet connote a certain relationship among the types? or purely stylistic? 

[18:14] <uzl> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/mu/master/docs/Perl6/Cheatsheet/cheatsheet.txt

[18:17] <Zoffix> uzl: looks like some of them are aligned next to the ops that operate on them

[18:18] <uzl> Zoffix: you mean the operator? Can you give me an example?

[18:19] <moritz> WTF

[18:19] <moritz> root@www:~# apache2ctl configtest

[18:19] <moritz> Syntax OK

[18:19] <moritz> but when I try to start apache, it says

[18:19] <moritz> AH00016: Configuration Failed

[18:19] <moritz> in the logs

[18:19] <Zoffix> heh

[18:20] <Zoffix> uzl: on closer look, it's not really aligned. But I was looking at "Str Buf Blob Uni NFC NFD NFKC NFKD buf8 buf16 buf32 utf8" being next to "~" op (now I see it's not really there)

[18:21] <Zoffix> uzl: also that stuff looks to be a bit outdated. There's no Bit type

[18:22] <moritz> ok, the actual error message was in one of the virtualhost log files

[18:22] <uzl> Zoffix: ~ belongs to the operators precedence section. 

[18:23] <moritz> Zoffix: huh, the old certs don't include rakudo.org either... do you know where they came from, originally?

[18:23] <uzl> so no Bit type. that's good to know.

[18:23] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:23] <Zoffix> moritz: IIRC I installed whem with cerbot from the repos, which we later removed.

[18:24] <Zoffix> moritz: it's possible they were installed without the webroot stuff, back when LE had a different authen method available

[18:24] <Zoffix> (I think that's true, but I maybe confusing it with dozens of other sites I use LE on)

[18:25] <Zoffix> I also hope I didn't break rakudo.org for a week :|

[18:25] <Zoffix> At least this still works.. https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/

[18:25] <uzl> I created this pdf version (http://docdro.id/CERRgm9) of that cheat sheet and was unsure if the order in which the types are placed were conveying any meaning.

[18:27] <chienjo> Zoffix, Thank you.

[18:27] <uzl> Zoffix: Thanks. I'll take a look at that!

[18:34] <moritz> ok, I think I fixed it, kinda, for the next 7 days

[18:34] <El_Che> I love when admins say that :)

[18:34] <moritz> Expires on: Saturday, July 14, 2018 at 11:43:51 AM

[18:35] <moritz> I hope that by then, the rate limit for LE has expired, and we can get new certs

[18:35] <Zoffix> oh man

[18:36] <Zoffix> .in 6d rakudo.org certs expire tomorrow. Did we fix the renewal issue?

[18:36] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll remind you on 13 Jul 2018 18:36Z

[18:36] <Zoffix> Though it's possible the rate limit that got tripped is the "There is a Failed Validation limit of 5 failures per account, per hostname, per hour"

[18:37] <Zoffix> Which happened ~45m ago

[18:37] <moritz> i'll try one more time before I go to bed tonight

[18:53] <chienjo> Zoffix, moritz thanks for the quick response.

[18:55] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:56] <moritz> you're welcome, and sorry for screwing up

[18:58] <moritz> huh, https://crt.sh/?q=perl6.org doesn't list the cert that was issued today

[18:59] <gfldex> is there any way to get the current value of an iterator?

[19:00] *** gabiruh joined
[19:00] *** chienjo left
[19:00] <moritz> I think the iterator API doesn't provide that

[19:01] <moritz> just pull-one to get the next one

[19:02] <lizmat> gfldex: there is no "peek-one" in Iterator  :-)

[19:02] <gfldex> and since all Iterators are forward iterators, there is no way to cheat

[19:02] <lizmat> gfldex: well, you could create a cheating Iterator

[19:02] <lizmat> that that's a non-cheating iterator as input

[19:03] <lizmat> s/that's/takes/

[19:03] <gfldex> I need to prewind an iterator on a list to a given value. Winding it past a given value would be easier :(

[19:12] *** uzl left
[19:17] <gfldex> Dennis Ritchie saved me :)

[19:17] *** sena_kun left
[19:17] *** sena_kun joined
[19:18] <gfldex> I got so used to not use C-loops that I forgot that they can setup an iterator and keep it's value (that is returned from a setup sub)

[19:23] <moritz> Zoffix: I've managed to obtain new certs via LE. This time including rakudo.org :-)

[23:15] <p6noob> Hi, am having a flaky problem with NativeCall.  Posted short example code here: https://is.gd/DaVu5t

[23:16] <p6noob> If you compile the c library and run the perl6 script, it will die 3 or 4 times out of 5

[23:16] *** mcmillhj left
[23:19] <p6noob> Just tried it with latest from git (2018.06-82-gb236fae built on MoarVM version 2018.06-34-g411f73f), weirdness.

[23:21] <jnthn> If you have valgrind installed, try running with perl6-valgrind-m to see if it provides any clues

[23:21] *** benjikun2 joined
[23:21] <p6noob> jnthn: okay, i'll install valgrind and see

[23:25] <p6noob> jnthn: seems to be a bit of a heisenbug, doesn't show up under valgrind run

[23:25] *** lizmat joined
[23:25] *** benjikun left
[23:27] <p6noob> but there is a huge amount of memory still "reachable" at the end of the run.    https://pastebin.com/CXCmRd30

[23:28] *** dct_ left
[23:36] <jnthn> Yeah, the VM leaves cleanup to the OS, since it can do it faster.

[23:37] <jnthn> One other thing to try: if you set MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 in the environment, does the problem go away?

[23:38] <jnthn> And either way, please do file an issue (https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues if you have a GitHub account, there's an email way if not), so we can try and reproduce and fix it

[23:38] <jnthn> (It's sleep time here, so I can't right now)

[23:55] <tbrowder_> ok, folks, my pr shows a viable method of grouping! we need to work on the html renderer to take advantage of the group/child hierarchy and decide what categories we want.

[23:55] <tbrowder_> and how we want them shown.

[23:56] <tbrowder_> check out the current Language display on the docs website.
