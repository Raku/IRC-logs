[01:53] <AlexDaniel> hmm…

[01:55] <AlexDaniel> or how did you install zef?

[01:55] <lookatme> zef --cpan install Bailador 

[01:56] <er2> AlexDaniel: I'm installed perl6 and zef via the debian sid repo

[01:56] <lookatme> or I think you can trying install JSON::Fast manually

[01:56] <timotimo> that error for "zef --force install zef" looks like something is trying to treat a list of file names as a single file name

[01:57] <timotimo> so it's getting the file names separated by spaces as "the file name"

[01:57] *** Celelibi joined
[01:57] <timotimo> i'd say grabbing zef via a tarball would be a good idea

[01:58] <AlexDaniel> there's no zef in debian repos

[01:58] <timotimo> i see there's no download link from modules.perl6.org directly to cpan dist tarballs

[01:58] <timotimo> anyway, i GTG. good luck!

[01:59] <er2> AlexDaniel: correct, it's the rakudo package

[02:02] <er2> I actually have an older package than what's currently in sid. I'll try updating it.

[12:25] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: no, because that module just uses .kill and I can do that myself.

[12:25] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: you can try using SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM/SIGSEGV in Proc::Q. I'm fairly sure I tried already that when I wrote that module, but maybe it works better now.

[12:26] <tbrowder_> did you try using any other signals except sigsegv?

[12:27] <tbrowder_>  i’ll try sigkill

[12:28] <tbrowder_> there are some notes in man pages about orphans and such depending on wait, blah blah

[19:34] <thowe> moritz!  You're a guy on here!  I just bought both your books :)

[19:34] <thowe> well, the two Perl6 books I know about anyway, maybe there's more...

[19:35] * masak is fairly sure moritz is a guy on most places ;)

[19:35] <timotimo> moritz: does that mean you'll set it up?

[19:39] <cfa> thowe: https://perl6book.com/

[19:39] <cfa> but yeah, moritz's are great

[19:40] <El_Che> kind of a diva, though

[19:41] <moritz> oh my, how did I earn that reputation, El_Che? :-)

[19:41] <moritz> thowe: let me know how you liked them; feedback is always appreciated

[19:41] <moritz> and good ratings on Amazon, of course :-)

[19:42] <El_Che> moritz: when you're on +1 books, you get the vip treatment :)

[19:43] <moritz> El_Che: might be a cultural thing, but "diva" sounds fairly negative to me

[19:43] <El_Che> moritz: it means you know your worth and whant to be treated as such

[19:43] <El_Che> (just kidding about the diva thing)

[19:44] <El_Che> (same meaning here, we don't live that far :) )

[19:44] <moritz> thought so :-)

[19:51] <thowe> moritz, I just started looking at the Parsing one last night.  My other one hasn't arrived yet.

[19:52] <thowe> I think Amazon ran out(?)

[19:52] <moritz> thowe: sure, I meant once you've finished one of them

[19:52] <thowe> is that a good sign?  Are Perl6 books selling well?

[19:52] <moritz> thowe: they dropped the price recently; maybe that's related

[19:52] <thowe> Yeah, I was watching them and then saw the price drop and hit them both.

[19:54] <thowe> I also donated to the Learning Perl6 kickstarter, but there are work projects I want to use to slip Perl6 into our code base, so I figured I should read something.

[19:54] <thowe> sooner than later, I mean.

[19:55] *** wamba joined
[19:55] <moritz> re selling, Fundamentals sold 54 ebook and 156 softcover copies until end of September 2017, if I read my roalty statement correctly

[19:56] <moritz> I don't have any data later than that

[19:56] <timotimo> someone gifted me one :3

[19:57] <moritz> and it was published around 2017-07-20, so that's roughly two months worth of data

[19:57] <thowe> If I like the Fundamentals one I will also get one for the office.  I've managed to get another guy here into Perl5 and Mojo, and he has an interest in Perl6.  The other guy is a Ruby guy, so I think I can garner some interest there as well.

[19:57] <thowe> I know my office mate also donated to the kickstarter.

[20:00] <cfa> [Coke]: i see you tweaked some whitespace already but it looks like html/images/Camelia{,-faded}.svg use tabs, so they're failing the doc test suite

[20:11] <Zoffix> Those svgs should just be excluded from whitespace tests. They're made by software entirely.

[20:11] <[Coke]> Ok.

[20:13] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: no idea what you mean by "safe enough" for me. I don't plan to run anything.
