[01:27] <ToddAndMargo> I am having troule with a checker error: ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/linuxutil/GetUpdates.pl6 Missing block at /home/linuxutil/GetUpdates.pl6:288

[01:27] <ToddAndMargo> ------>       #             'UNKNOWN'       =>‚èè 0,    #  0000b, unknown (default)

[01:28] <ToddAndMargo> Why is it complaining about a "comment" I wrote?  How do I troubleshoot this?

[01:29] <timotimo> i would assume you had an opening < on an earlier line

[01:29] <timotimo> so it was parsing an array like <foo bar baz>

[01:30] <ToddAndMargo> checking!

[01:30] <timotimo> i get that from seeing that it puts the error marker after the >

[01:31] <DrForr> .seen lizmat

[01:31] <yoleaux> I saw lizmat 1 Aug 2018 16:08Z in #perl6: <lizmat> in any case, it didn't even build  :-(

[01:33] <ToddAndMargo> not finding it.  the closest is `PrintRed( "$Str\>\n" );`

[01:34] <timotimo> i'd probably have to see the rest of the file. maybe syntax highlighting in your editor can give a clue, but editors often get the finest details wrong

[01:37] <ToddAndMargo> I am going to put some junk in to find where it chashes and waht it up to the error

[01:38] <timotimo> maybe you can put in a > earlier than the error happened and move it further and further back until the error message changes

[01:39] <timotimo> a > in the wrong place will, of course (?) also give an error

[01:39] *** lizmat joined
[01:40] <ToddAndMargo> I am walking it with `$xxx= (25;`

[01:40] <timotimo> m: my $foo = (25; 26; 27;); say $foo.perl

[01:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0ac427612: OUTPUT: ¬´$(25, 26, 27)‚ê§¬ª

[01:40] <timotimo> that's actually a valid code fragment you have there

[01:42] <timotimo> i've got to go now, good luck!

[01:43] <ToddAndMargo> Found it!  `if $Debug || $Status >= %StatusHash<%StatusHash<ERROR> { `  Now I have a new tool to troubleshoot!

[02:23] <ToddAndMargo> What is the proper way to escape all the slashes in the following:

[02:23] <ToddAndMargo> if  $Line ~~ | '/windows/security/anti-virus/c/combofix/ComboFix.exe' |  {do something}

[02:28] <ryn1x> Forward slashes should work fine on windows.... or you can 'c:\\path\\to\\file.exe'... I do not think your path is correct though... windows does not have a root '/' dir like unix... you have to start with a drive letter like 'c:/windows/security ...'

[02:39] <ToddAndMargo> I am in Linux

[02:40] <ryn1x> What are you intending the vertical bars to do? I haven't seen that syntax yet, but I am still pretty new.

[02:42] <ToddAndMargo> I am testing to see if this line exists:

[02:43] <ToddAndMargo> https://download.bleepingcomputer.com/dl/e2821c2ab7f86d00ce296cbdbdab14dc/5b626705/windows/security/anti-virus/c/combofix/ComboFix.exe

[02:43] <ToddAndMargo> Thjis was my workaround: `if  $Line ~~ m{ "dl/" (.*) ( "/windows" ) }  {}`

[02:51] <ryn1x> ```.contains``` might be easier than a regex

[02:51] <ryn1x> p6: say 'https://download.bleepingcomputer.com/dl/e2821c2ab7f86d00ce296cbdbdab14dc/5b626705/windows/security/anti-virus/c/combofix/ComboFix.exe'.contains: '/windows/security/anti-virus/c/combofix/ComboFix.exe'

[07:50] <masak> good morning, #perl6

[07:50] *** Kaiepi left
[07:50] <masak> I usually constrain Perl 6 macro discussions to #perl6-macros, but I have two pieces of good news that I'd like to discuss here if anyone has the stamina

[07:50] *** dpk joined
[07:51] <masak> oh, and a question, which is really for TimToady but which might be good to broadcast

[07:57] <moritz> masak: I'll have to leave for a meeting, but I'd love to read your news when I backlog :-)

[07:58] <masak> wonderful.

[08:04] <masak> (I) There's now a concrete plan for how to achieve hygiene with macros. Jumping straight to the big insight, macros have the useful property that they run _once_ per bit of injected code, so any lookups into the macro can be precomputed and replaced by a Location, which can then be read and written. it's nice and confluent, because we were already sniffing at a Location abstraction for unrelated reasons: 

[08:04] <masak> https://github.com/masak/007/issues/214#issuecomment-409670173

[08:06] <masak> (II) Something called "contextual macros" has taken shape in the past week or so. They seem to be able to implement (syntactic) junctions, an `each` macro, and the `amb` macro.

[08:07] <masak> they essentially supersede the older, less concrete idea of "watcher macros"

[08:07] <masak> https://github.com/masak/007/issues/349

[08:07] <masak> and here now, is my question:

[08:08] <masak> does COMPILING:: only dig into the _static_ scope? is there/could there be something corresponding that digs into a _runtime_ scope from a macro?

[08:08] <masak> (I don't know what to call such a pseudo-package. I suppose MY:: is not quite it. maybe RUNTIME:: ?)

[08:14] *** xiaomiao joined
[08:22] *** Xliff joined
[08:25] <Xliff> \w

[08:25] <Xliff> \o, even

[08:25] <lizmat> masak: UNIT:: perhaps

[08:25] <lizmat> Xliff  o/\

[08:26] <Xliff> lismat: Your head is outsidef your arms!

[08:28] <lizmat> yeah, it felt funny :-)

[08:29] <Xliff> :)

[08:50] *** sena_kun joined
[08:56] <masak> lizmat: hm -- what makes "unit" a fitting description of a runtime scope corresponding to COMPILING?

[08:57] *** vrurg joined
[08:57] *** maettu left
[08:57] <lizmat> hmmm... good question: I guess I wasn't awake just yet

[08:57] <masak> it feels to me that the initial use case for COMPILING:: is that things like $?LINE are constant, but that's weird because we know it changes all the time ;)

[08:58] <masak> so COMPILING:: is the scope that can bend the rules a little bit, and $?LINE is assignable in it

[08:58] <lizmat> so do you think COMPILING:: has a narrowed scope than MY:: ?

[08:58] <lizmat> *narrower

[08:58] <lizmat> perhaps THUNK:: then ?

[08:58] <lizmat> as a name ?

[08:59] <masak> heh -- I definitely wouldn't think THUNK:: was what I wanted if I went looking for it in the docs :P

[08:59] <lizmat> my $a; ENTER $a = 42   # is that one COMPILING:: or 2 ?

[09:00] <lizmat> so are you asking for something new or something existing

[09:00] * lizmat is confused

[09:00] <masak> I've lost count of how many cross purposes we've accumulated o.O this is hard to talk about

[09:00] <masak> please slow down :)

[09:00] <masak> COMPILING:: already exists. I think I can pick out three orthogonal use cases for it. one of them is "from macros/quasis", which is neat

[09:02] <masak> that latter one is the only one where COMPILING:: isn't close in _space_ to the scope you're in. so besides meaning "a mutable static scope (used by the compiler)" it also kinda means "the scope that the macro call is in; where we were just now before calling the macro"

[09:02] <masak> I find all of that neat and I don't want to change any of that

[09:03] <masak> but -- I'm now having use cases where I want everything from the above list except the "static scope" bit

[09:04] <masak> my use case is an infix:<ff> macro, by the way

[09:04] *** vrurg left
[09:04] <masak> it turns out it falls out _very_ nicely if the macro is allowed to inject (gensym'd) variables into the current _runtime_ scope of the macro

[09:05] <masak> the variable in question would keep track of whether the `infix:<ff>` operator is "switched on" or not

[09:05] <lizmat> but at runtime, scopes (lexpads) are static, no ?

[09:06] <masak> in my mental model, each _block_ (thing with braces) has one static scope/lexpad, and zero or more runtime scopes/lexpads, one per time it was entered

[09:07] <masak> the static lexpad (a) populates the runtime lexpads with defaults, and (b) acts as an ultimate fallback for lookup that's doing weird enough things, like the fun method-in-method example

[09:07] <masak> m: class C { method foo { my $x = "OH HAI"; method bar { say $x } } }; C.new.bar

[09:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0ac427612: OUTPUT: ¬´(Any)‚ê§¬ª

[09:14] <masak> but the terminology is confusing and varies from case to case. moarvm talks about frames where I would talk about blocks, for example.

[09:18] <lizmat> and then you talk about a mental model, when it is maybe more a frame of mind  :-)

[09:18] <masak> haha

[09:19] <masak> I should add that I'm aware that what I'm asking for here is, um, temporally suspicious

[09:19] <masak> in the sense that a macro is definitely BEGIN-time, and so it shouldn't have much to say about what happens to variables at runtime

[09:20] <lizmat> that is my feeling as well

[09:20] <lizmat> but the flag could be planted at compile time, and set/inspected at runtime, no?

[09:21] <masak> that's the idea

[09:21] <masak> in the case of this flag, it needs to be initialized in a `once` statement.

[09:21] <lizmat> in a way this feels like being able to export a phaser to the scope in which a "use" statement is done

[09:21] <masak> yeah, kinda like that

[09:22] <masak> except that this is exporting "in time" instead of "in space" :)

[09:27] <masak> in a very real sense, the quasi in a macro is already talking about the dynamic/runtime aspects of the code, in the simple sense that the code injected is meant to be run

[09:29] <lizmat> but that's the basic BEGIN conundrum, no?

[09:32] <masak> not sure... what's the basic BEGIN conundrum? :)

[09:33] <lizmat> that you're running code when compilation has not finished yet

[09:33] <lizmat> (of the compilation unit(

[09:33] <masak> oh! yeah, there are gnarly side effects of that, for sure

[09:33] <masak> particularly http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/lexpads-and-why-roles-need-fixups which shows up as an issue in macros, too

[09:39] <masak> there's jnthn's vodka quote about that one. I talked about it with him again last week, and he just said "yeah -- let me know if you find a good solution to that one"

[09:41] <lizmat> vodka quote ?

[09:46] <masak> literally the first line in the linked post ;)

[09:48] <lizmat> ah, ok... I try not to get distracted too much  :-)

[09:49] <masak> no worries; didn't mean to distract :)

[09:49] <masak> the blog post uses "lexpad" where nowadays I'd use "frame", but those are 1-to-1 so it doesn't matter very much

[12:50] <masak> I have some encouraging microbenchmark news:

[12:50] <masak> I just went back to http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/send-more-money-in-perl6 and re-ran some of the Perl 6 examples

[12:50] <[Coke]> MasterDuke: it was delicious but weird.

[12:51] <masak> the Perl 6 port of the Perl 5 version of Version A used to take 15 minutes back in 2015. it now takes 2m19s on my laptop.

[12:52] <masak> Version B used to take 15 seconds. it now takes 4 seconds.

[13:13] <masak> that code seems to have bitrotted. I don't know exactly why; maybe lizmat knows.

[13:13] <masak> (-) seems to now be returning Pair values, which I don't think it did back then

[13:13] <Zoffix> the error suggests a missing decont in the guts somewhere

[13:14] <timotimo> shees, the iteration one spends 21.6% in sink, but it's called 26,064,244 times

[13:14] <masak> Zoffix: oh, so it's a rakudobug?

[13:14] <timotimo> but it does do something, as the inclusive time is a bit more than the exclusive time

[13:15] * Zoffix sprays masak with WD40 he won yesterday

[13:15] <timotimo> jeez, all the time sink doesn't spend in "itself" it spends in identity

[13:16] <timotimo> i wonder if that's almost 100% profiler overhead %)

[13:18] <Zoffix> masak: but what I was gonna say about that program is if you're using `(-)` a ton of times, wouldn't it make the program faster to just use a Set instead of @digits?

[13:18] <masak> timotimo: if nothing else, I guess it says something about the need for eliminating sinks

[13:18] <masak> Zoffix: probably.

[13:18] <Zoffix> I think p6sink already does some elimination

[13:18] <masak> Zoffix: or maybe arrays and grep instead of sets

[13:19] <Zoffix> (or maybe I'm misremembering)

[13:20] <timotimo> this is sink from List, it has a few ops left in it

[13:22] <Zoffix> List.sink is a noop. Maybe we should eliminate the call entirely in static optimizer/p6sink?

[13:22] <timotimo> how often do we know it's that exact type?

[13:22] <timotimo> what if someone mixes in something, etc

[13:23] <masak> g'ah, exact types. the bane of optimizations everywhere.

[13:23] <timotimo> that's spesh's domain :)

[13:23] <Zoffix> :)

[13:23] <tbrowder_> can we have an irc channel for pod? say, #perl6-pod

[13:24] <Zoffix> Why do we have a million channels?

[13:24] *** alexghacker left
[13:24] <Zoffix> TIL we have #perl6-macro

[13:24] <Zoffix> or whatevere it was masak mentioned. I don't even remember anymore

[13:25] <Zoffix> #perl6-dev was ded for the past ~12 hours. Why do you need a separate channel to be dead for pod dev?

[13:25] <timotimo> maybe it should be renamed to #007-perl6

[13:25] * Zoffix finds all the 007 stuff offputting TBH

[13:25] <timotimo> oh?

[13:25] <Zoffix> The bond stuff I mean

[13:25] <timotimo> i find it cute and harmless

[13:25] <timotimo> it's not like we expect to be pushing 007 to business execs

[13:26] <Zoffix> I mean, I wanna read the docs, but I keep getting through references to some movie

[13:27] <tbrowder_> because we can? anyone want to talk pod? we need some consensus on getting formatting code working everywhere, but how to do it is the question. only in the renderers? a text class for every pod string that will always have format attributes?

[13:28] <tbrowder_> etc.

[13:28] <tbrowder_> big changes...

[13:28] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: that doesn't answer the question. If you want concensus, why seek it in a place most devs won't know exists instead of‚Äîyou know‚Äîthe channel specifically designed for development discussions.

[13:29] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: especially if in the future you want to refer to previous conversation. Now you got to search through $n number of channels because you don't really remember which channel the discussion was on.

[13:29] <tbrowder_> well i‚Äôm blocked at the moment and haven‚Äôt been able to register

[13:30] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: so register. It takes 2 seconds.

[13:30] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: how do we know you're the real tbrowder_?

[13:30] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: what's the problem with registering?

[13:30] <Zoffix> mst can probably fix it

[13:31] <Zoffix> /msg NickServ REGISTER teh-password tbrowser@some-email.com

[13:31] <Zoffix> Did you do that?

[13:31] <tbrowder_> not if you‚Äôre a non-irc xpert, catch 22, define an alias before you register it,

[13:31] <Zoffix> What alias?

[13:32] <tbrowder_> but i‚Äôm registered here, how? beats the heck out of me

[13:32] <timotimo> https://imgur.com/Ei9UwJs - masak, Zoffix, how do you like this view?

[13:32] <Zoffix> NickServ (NickServ@services.): tbrowder_ is not registered.

[13:33] <tbrowder_> any hoo, i‚Äôll quit whining until i can get it sorted out

[13:33] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: did you register with the NickServ register command?

[13:33] <timotimo> "register" alone isn't enough, you also need to "identify" whenever you connect. though your irc client likely has a feature that automates it

[13:33] <timotimo> also, i think freenode allows sasl-based authentication, which logs you in even before you're fully connected

[13:33] <tbrowder_> i originally did, but then that trailing underscore popped up, so who knows

[13:34] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: well, switch back to nick without underscore

[13:34] <timotimo> tbrowder without underscore is currently logged in, too

[13:34] <tbrowder_> freenode knows my email and i have a password

[13:34] <timotimo> has been idle for 14 hours, says /whois

[13:34] <Zoffix> NickServ (NickServ@services.): tbrowder is not registered.

[13:35] <Zoffix> tbrowder_: doesn't look like you registerd that nick either

[13:35] <tbrowder_> \o/

[13:36] <mst> your irccloud account is connected twice

[13:36] <mst> the first connection is as tbrowder

[13:36] <mst> use that one to register, then confirm it, then everything should be fine

[13:36] <Zoffix> m: dd 1 (-) ($ = :42foo,) # golfed crash for the set thing

[13:37] <Zoffix> timotimo: don't know what any of the stuff on the image means, so I have no opinion :)

[13:39] <timotimo> it's like the profiler, but newer!

[13:40] <timotimo> here you can see that sink spends a lot of time in total, but only 0.06 nanoseconds per call

[13:40] <timotimo> at least i think ns is what comes at 1/1000 of a ms

[13:41] <Zoffix> timotimo: microsecond

[14:01] <Ulti> another one is to know any of those tags exist to find the tickets

[14:01] <timotimo> masak: we're already fully inlining these sinks and the "identity" functions inside them (identity is what a decontrv that doesn't do anything spesh-plugins to)

[14:01] <timotimo> masak: it's just we keep too much crap around due to deopt potential, i believe

[14:04] <timotimo> ooh that's funny

[14:04] <timotimo> directly after the "next" we leave in the call to speshresolve and the call to the result of it

[14:05] <timotimo> because we never logged anything there, because the point after "next" wasn't reached before the routine got speshed

[14:08] *** jmerelo joined
[14:08] <Ulti> so I think this script I just hacked up is really torturing Rakudo possibly because it creates a very large string it has to deal with

[14:45] <masak> timotimo: it looks like in the rightmost column there is a space before the '/' but not after

[14:46] <timotimo> ah, indeed!

[14:46] <timotimo> i have to put that in explicitly after i split the JSX into lines

[14:46] <timotimo> so a {" "} was necessary

[14:47] <Zoffix> xelak: try again

[14:47] <masak> :)

[14:47] <timotimo> and the colors for the bars are obviously atrocious :)

[14:48] <timotimo> i'm looking for a design pattern that would let me point out to the user "you can click here to get an explanation for this little thing", do you know of anything better than just a little question mark in a box or circle?

[14:48] <timotimo> there's the "what's this" thing that windows used to have, that it seems like never got any use anywhere

[15:19] <El_Che> what about making the channel moderated and giving everyone a voice 10 seconds after joined?

[15:21] <El_Che> (my client ignore every newly joined nick for 10 seconds)

[15:22] <Zoffix> Kinda confusing. You join, say "Hey all!" and get a message that you can't talk.

[15:22] <El_Che> the boot could write something for the new user

[15:23] <El_Che> nick: Welcome. You'll be able to write to the channels in 10 seconds (a temporarely measure against spam).

[15:23] <El_Che> anyway, let's see if the active setup works

[15:23] <El_Che> maybe the spammers will die from hepatitis C sooner

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: hello

[15:54] <nebuchadnezzar> Zoffix: what about setting the chan to +r to allow only registered and logged in users to speak instead of being in moderated mode?

[15:54] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: haven't read the intsructions yet, but it looks freaking awesome

[15:54] <xinming> don't forget me please

[15:55] <Zoffix> nebuchadnezzar: that's what it originally was, and people said, "what about giving voice after 10seconds instead of requiring users to register" :)

[15:55] <xinming> I can speak, I was afraid of being blocked out. :-)

[15:55] <geekosaur> +r means they can't even join

[15:55] * El_Che ducks

[15:55] <nebuchadnezzar> Zoffix: so a bot will voice new people after 10 seconds, I'm ok with that

[15:56] <El_Che> nebuchadnezzar: we're a newbie friendly channel, lots of unregistered people pop in for a question

[15:57] <Zoffix> hm, weird.

[15:57] <Zoffix> The bot's meant to +v web users right away

[15:58] <nebuchadnezzar> so what happen to bots trying to spam the chan? How are they discriminated from users?

[15:58] <Zoffix> nebuchadnezzar: that's why there's a 10 second delay

[15:58] <El_Che> nebuchadnezzar: they are k-lined automatically

[15:58] <El_Che> mostly before the 10 secs

[15:58] <Zoffix> nebuchadnezzar: at least in theory, the bot will send the spam in those 10 seconds and then piss off, and we never get it

[15:58] <Juerd> I feel we came full-circle, because the first Perl IRC channel I've visited was efnet #perl which had +m and a bot that would give +v, delayed... :D

[15:58] <Zoffix> lol

[16:01] <Juerd> El_Che: PHP started as a Perl script. There's probably some pattern here...

[16:01] <Zoffix> I wonder if the bot just waits until it gets voiced if the channel is +m.

[16:01] <Zoffix> That's how I'd make it if I made one

[16:01] <El_Che> perl 6 started as a perl5 script

[16:01] <nebuchadnezzar> Zoffix: notify new comer with a token to reply to the bot?

[16:01] <Juerd> Zoffix: Could be. I never expected it to be that smart...

[16:01] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: ah, makes sense

[16:01] <Juerd> nebuchadnezzar: Ooooh. An IRC captcha!

[16:02] <Zoffix> nebuchadnezzar: my original idea seems simpler than that , but people didn't like it

[16:02] <Zoffix> nebuchadnezzar: the idea being the user just changes nick to end with "-p6" or registers it or uses webchat. And the bot tells them to do any of those things

[16:02] <El_Che> bump the time and see if it's ok?

[16:02] <jmerelo> .seen AlexDaniel

[16:02] <AlexDaniel> I'm right here?

[19:42] <vrurg> Ok, then manual type-checking is what I doomed to have. 

[19:42] <xinming> Is it possible to apply roles to loaded class for the runtime globally?

[19:42] <Zoffix> vrurg: there's a module for that stuff. I think a couple even

[19:42] <Zoffix> xinming: I think augment can do it

[19:42] <vrurg> Zoffix: two. Both doing it absolutely wrong way.

[19:42] <Zoffix> vrurg: ah, too bad :)

[19:42] <vrurg> One fails if attribute is declared in a role.

[19:43] <Zoffix> m: use MONKEY-TYPING; class Foos {}; role Meows { method z { say "meow" } }; augment class Foos does Meows {}; Foos.z

[19:44] <moritz> vrurg: if you work with a Proxy, you need to store the actual value somewhere else

[21:06] <Zoffix> [Zoffix] (WeeChat@perl6/zoffix)

[21:06] <moritz> hey mst, can I please get a perl6 affilication/cloak whatever it's called on freenode? kthxbye

[21:06] *** chsanch left
[21:06] <timotimo> have you looked through the test cases in the Inline::Perl5 repo?

[21:06] <timotimo> oops

[21:06] <timotimo> my ssh session is laggy %)

[21:07] <Zoffix> El_Che: see the host is all cool-lookin'? That's a cloak

[21:07] *** vrurg left
[21:08] <El_Che> yes, I know what a cloack is, I just wonder how it works (a reverse dns type of setup, a login to the services, etc)

[21:08] <Zoffix> A login I think

[21:09] <Zoffix> SmokeMachine: that means everyone will lose 1 message before they can talk. That'd be mighty confusing for noobs and annoying for everyone else

[21:10] <SmokeMachine> the bot could "print" it

[21:10] <Zoffix> SmokeMachine: oh yeah... that's the other issue. How would the bot see the message? Is there a user mode that lets you see muted messages?

[21:11] <SmokeMachine> Zoffix: thats a good question...

[21:11] <SmokeMachine> :(

[21:11] <Zoffix> Also, doesn't look like there's been any spam attacks after bumping to 15s (even tho #zofbot did get spammed), so I guess we're good

[21:12] <El_Che> \o/

[21:12] <Zoffix> moritz: BTW we have two: @perl6/moritz and @perl6/developer/moritz. Tell mst which one you want

[21:12] <El_Che> +Zoffix+

[21:15] <Zoffix> Just noticed: a user joining all 4 of our channels gets 4 notices :P

[21:16] <Zoffix> Made it ban by `.host.contains: '/'` I think that covers all the cloaks and none of potential spam domains
