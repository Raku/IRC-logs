[00:23] <timotimo> there is not, you will have to use something like Z perhaps

[00:23] <timotimo> fake_space_whale: ^

[00:23] <timotimo> it'll not quite be as simple as the ». version, then

[00:23] <timotimo> though of course you can have a local sub and ».&mysub

[00:23] <timotimo> that can do your bidding

[10:08] <Ulti> well unless I have a bunch of RAM which quite a lot of the machines I'd run this code on would have

[10:09] <Ulti> which is why I really need to spend some time writing a wrapper to the C libraries for dealing with these much heavier formats

[10:10] <timotimo> true. in that case i'd probably go with the approach of storing beginning-of-sequence offset integers in a native int array

[10:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v saki

[10:12] <Ulti> https://github.com/samtools/htslib binding this direct to Perl 6 objects is probably the way to go for that sort of thing

[10:12] <Ulti> most of the formats are also indexed or can be

[10:12] <Ulti> as in on disk you have an index, essentially they reinvented databases for every format *faceoalm*

[10:13] <timotimo> hah

[10:13] <Ulti> in fairness sometimes with slightly more optimal compression than you'd get otherwise

[10:13] <timotimo> that's fair

[10:13] <timotimo> at the very least you can put three bases into one 16 bit number, even when you also support all letters of the alphabet

[10:15] <Ulti> yeah Im currently working on a super compact format for genetic variation with bit packing where I can get it into 64bits so if you know the genetic variant you know the database ID

[10:16] <Ulti> at the moment everyone uses an abstracted identity that just makes it super slow to move data around or from file to a database

[10:16] <Ulti> when you could just have a strict definition of computing a uuid like thing instead

[10:16] <Ulti> none of the formats kind of exist for a good reason

[10:17] <timotimo> :D

[10:17] <Ulti> or worse are optimised way too far for one purpose but used for everything

[10:17] <Ulti> the xkcd on formats applies really hard in bioinformatics

[10:23] <timotimo> i think there's one more, too

[10:25] <timotimo> Ddt is the one i always forget

[10:25] <timotimo> it's the only one that has the Authoring tag apart from GPTrixie, but it's also in there three times :D

[10:26] <timotimo> https://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Assixt:cpan:TYIL

[10:26] <Ulti> yeah not sure why names are quite so whimsical in Perl 6 given sensible name space is wide open, I guess its indicative of O(fun)

[10:26] <timotimo> this renders the pod properly

[10:27] <Ulti> do any of them cut a release to cpan for you, the one thing I would love to never have to do myself

[10:27] <timotimo> mi6 and assixt do that

[10:28] <timotimo> push is actually a shorthand for bump, dist and upload. As such, it will bump the version number and update the version number throughout the files in your module, then create a distribution of it (as a .tar.gz file) and finally try to upload that distribution to CPAN.

[10:28] <timotimo> this is from the assixt readme

[11:00] <tyil> if that doesnt work either, I'll have time tonight to look into your specific issue

[11:00] <tyil> it should work, it passed CI testing, but I'm only human and I can make bugs in the tests as well :p

[11:01] <rindolf> tyil: see https://slashdot.org/story/06/05/20/1651253/the-cvs-cop-out

[11:01] <tyil> eh, I'm just trying to help you

[13:43] <buggable> New CPAN upload: App-Assixt-1.0.0.tar.gz by TYIL http://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Assixt:cpan:TYIL

[13:49] <Summertime> would it be possible to define some code that works syntaxically like sub/method/et al.

[13:49] <Summertime> thinking: query some-name ($variable) { blah };

[13:50] <lizmat> m: my $code = { say "foo" }; $code()   # like that ?

[13:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar df2783ca6: OUTPUT: «foo␤»

[13:51] <Summertime> sorta

[13:52] <Summertime> for context, I'm looking at the graphql funsies, which usually have a website's api split across a schema, and a pre-defined query system

[13:52] <Summertime> https://graphql.org/learn/queries/

[13:53] <Summertime> so having introspection on definition of the block is the main aim

[13:54] <Summertime> https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables visually maps to a sub fairly well, but... well its not a sub, or... wait would traits be the go?

[13:54] <lizmat> m: sub a($a.$b,:$foo) {}; dd &a.signature  # something like this?

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar df2783ca6: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed parameter␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3sub a($a7⏏5.$b,:$foo) {}; dd &a.signature  # someth␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[13:54] <lizmat> m: sub a($a.$b,:$foo) {}; dd &a.signature  # something like this?

[13:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar df2783ca6: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Malformed parameter␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3sub a($a7⏏5.$b,:$foo) {}; dd &a.signature  # someth␤    expecting any of:␤        constraint␤»

[13:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar df2783ca6: OUTPUT: «:($a, $b, :$foo)␤»

[13:55] <Summertime> I know there is introspection, just wanting it to be as abstracted away as possible

[13:55] <lizmat> I'm still not following exactly :-(

[13:56] <Summertime> well, current aim would be

[13:56] <Summertime> sub a-query($a-variable) is query { ... }

[13:57] <lizmat> and what would the trait do ?

[13:57] <Summertime> take the sub, and make it call the graphql api instead of just being a sub

[13:58] <Summertime> a DSL I guess

[13:58] <Summertime> there is also some stuff in perl6 for DSLs right? used to embed other languages into perl6?

[14:00] <pmurias> Summertime: you can extend arbitrarily extend the grammar in Perl 6

[14:00] <pmurias> it's called slangs

[14:13] <lizmat> so maybe that should not compile

[14:37] <rindolf> Ulti: thanks

[14:38] <Ulti> https://github.com/araraloren/perl6-getopt-advance/blob/master/lib/Getopt/Advance/Option.pm6#L330 uses a grammar which is quite fancy

[14:39] <Ulti> I should pay a bit more attention to whats coming onto the ecosystem

[14:40] <Ulti> some of this feels like it should make its way into how MAIN works in core, I've had some issues recently with limitations of numeric types like someone having to give 1e4 type strings if its a Num type and not if its a Rat in the signature

[14:41] <Ulti> the user of a CLI program shouldn't have to care about those sorts of differences in literal rep inside Perl 6 from the outside

[14:41] <Ulti> I guess I now have an ecosystem module for that so can't complain >:3

[20:12] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[20:15] * rindolf is afk

[20:21] <timotimo> geekosaur: i think .Slip vs prefix:<|> is a difference when it's in a sub/method call

[20:22] <timotimo> m: sub takes-args(*@pos, *%nameds) { dd @pos; dd %nameds }; sub makes-hash { %( :1a, :2b ) }; takes-args(makes-hash.Slip); takes-args(|makes-hash)

[20:22] <timotimo> Altreus: ^- important difference

[20:23] <Altreus> oh yes that is quite important

[20:23] <Altreus> and I did want |

[20:23] <timotimo> method calls bind tighter than prefix operators

[20:29] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cbk

[20:30] <cbk> wow! That was new?

[20:31] <timotimo> are you refering to our anti-spam thing?

[20:32] <cbk> yeah.  Sorry to see #perl6 is having those issues.

[20:32] <cbk> hope it works good and keeps the spamers out!!

[20:34] * rindolf is back

[20:35] <timotimo> yeah, freenode was being hammered for a while

[20:35] <timotimo> a few days ago we thought it was over, but it came right back

[20:35] <timotimo> the spam bots don't realize their messages aren't reaching the channel and so they join, and a bit later they either quit, or get banned from the network

[20:35] <timotimo> and we never see their spam

[20:35] <cbk> Guess I need to log in more frequently.

[20:35] <timotimo> on the other hand, newcomers and casual visitors are inconvenienced

[20:36] <cbk> not really that much of an inconvenience though, no worries.  Just never seen that before.

[20:36] <timotimo> i'm not sure if p6bannerbot will react if someone logs in to nickserv and immediately voices you in that case

[20:36] <timotimo> glad to hear it's okay

[20:37] <cbk> I have an issue i seek assistance with...  What would be the best way to (if possible) in a single statement to match an value in a list of unsigned integers OR an list of strings? 

[20:37] <cbk> like ether 1 or 2 or 3 OR 'day' or 'night'

[20:38] <timotimo> hm, so your code sometimes gets a list of strings, and in that case it should match "day" or "night"

[20:38] <timotimo> or it gets a list of ints and then it should match 1 or 2 or 3?

[20:38] <cbk> I had orgnally used a regex but my [1..4] keeps matching 2.5 and thats not what I was looking for

[20:39] <timotimo> ah, you're writing the character class as if it were a mix of perl 5 and 6

[20:39] <cbk> no it can match day or night or a list of unsigned integers [1..4]

[20:39] <rindolf> shlomif[Perl6]:$trunk$ zef install -v --deps-only --/test . is not helpful

[20:39] <timotimo> oooh, i see

[20:40] <cbk> ok so an regex character class?

[20:40] <rindolf> timotimo: any idea about my issue?

[20:40] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, 3, 4, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5).grep((1..4).list.any)

[20:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc23b197a: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3 4)␤»

[20:40] <timotimo> the trick is that a range as matcher will indeed match any numeric thing in between

[20:40] <cbk> I have this as a regex..

[20:40] <timotimo> but if you translate it into a list first, and then do a membership test (or if you make it a Set) ...

[20:42] <cbk> my regex value { [1..4] || :i['day' | 'night'] }

[20:42] <timotimo> rindolf: i don't know why it doesn't install the test-depends, maybe it only does that if you "zef test"?

[20:42] <timotimo> i mean, you literally have --/test, maybe zef interprets that as "don't run tests" and "don't install test deps"

[20:42] <timotimo> cbk: right, that would match 1ab4 or 1.24 or 1  4

[20:43] <timotimo> you have to put the [1..4] inside < >

[20:43] <timotimo> on the other hand...

[20:43] <cbk> like this?: my regex value { <[1..4]> || :i['day' | 'night'] }

[20:43] <rindolf> timotimo: zef test is invalid

[20:44] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, 3, "day", 9, 10, 11, "cat").grep(/ @( 1..4 .Slip, "day", "night" ) /)

[20:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc23b197a: OUTPUT: «(1 day 10 11)␤»

[20:44] <timotimo> ah, this also probably needs to be bounded

[20:44] <cbk> how do i do bounding?

[20:44] <timotimo> because right now it says "hey there's a 1 here, great!"

[20:44] <timotimo> depends on what's around your stuff. left and right word boundary is usually a good choice

[20:44] *** itaipu left
[20:44] <cbk> yeah I had that issue thats way i was using the 1..4

[20:45] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, 3, "day", 9, 10, 11, "cat").grep(/ @(<1 2 3 4 day night) /)

[20:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc23b197a: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Unable to parse expression in quote words; couldn't find final '>' (corresponding starter was at line 1)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3, "cat").grep(/ @(<1 2 3 4 day night) /)7⏏5<EOL>␤    expecting an…»

[20:45] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, 3, "day", 9, 10, 11, "cat").grep(/ @(<1 2 3 4 day night>) /)

[20:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc23b197a: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3 day 10 11)␤»

[20:45] <timotimo> a tiny bit shorter way to write it, if your range is short

[20:45] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, 3, "day", 9, 10, 11, "cat").grep(/ << @(<1 2 3 4 day night>) >> /)

[20:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar fc23b197a: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3 day)␤»

[20:46] *** davercc joined
[20:46] <cbk> !!? ok so the << and >> does the bounding?

[20:46] *** davercc left
[20:46] <timotimo> that's right

[20:46] <timotimo> either << or «, and >> or »

[20:46] <cbk> Ok I'll go play around with that!  Thank you timotimo 

[20:47] <timotimo> good luck & have fun :)

[20:47] <cbk> timotimo++

[20:47] <cbk> is that ++ still a thing?

[20:47] <cbk> karma or something

[20:47] <cbk> :)

[20:48] <timotimo> yeah, we still do that

[20:48] <timotimo> we don't count it, though

[20:48] <timotimo> we also have prefix ++ for when someone says they'll do something and you want to encourage them

[21:13] <timotimo> lichtkind: you were probably expecting Math::Matrix to be a class or role or something, but it apparently is just a package?

[21:14] <lichtkind> timotimo, well im trying outsource some methods out of the module but need it as a type still in the signatures

[21:16] <timotimo> hm, so it kind of exists
