[01:30] <timotimo> it was a piece of hardware that a german electronics online/phone store offered a couple of years ago

[01:31] <timotimo> it was supposed to be a picture frame, you could upload jpegs and it'd give you a slideshow

[01:31] <timotimo> and there was a debug mode that would let you flash updates, so people went ahead and wrote their own custom firmware

[07:06] <Xliff> jj: Missing a few constants. Did you want standard gravity (g), electron-mass, neutron-mass and proton-mass?

[07:06] <Xliff> Let me know and I will write the tests and submit a PR

[07:07] <jmerelo> Xliff: if I remember correctly, I should have the first two, not the others. By all means, give them a try. Thanks!

[07:07] <Xliff> Is Constants.pm for constants not found in Parser/ ?

[07:08] <jmerelo> Xliff: sorry, what?

[07:08] <Xliff> p6-Math-Parser has a Constants.pm and another file called ebyteParse-output.txt

[07:09] *** telex joined
[07:09] <Xliff> I can find some of the constants I mentioned in the 2nd file, but not in the first.

[07:09] <jmerelo> Xliff: not mine, I think. 

[07:09] <Xliff> OK.

[07:09] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v telex

[07:09] <jmerelo> Xliff: oh, yes, that was mine. 

[07:10] <jmerelo> A PR I didn't remember

[07:10] <jmerelo> Sorry

[07:10] <jmerelo> So, back to this "Constants.pm for constants not found in Parser/"

[07:11] <jmerelo> Xliff: it should be in lib/Math/Constants.pm6

[07:11] <Xliff> OK, then. Now I feel silly, because my changes are GONE.

[07:11] <Xliff> TYou have universal G, but not standard g

[07:12] <Xliff> Electron mass, photon mass and neutron mass are not in Constants.pm

[07:12] <jmerelo> Xliff: then g would be great. And the rest too, I guess :-) Thanks!

[07:12] <Xliff> And there are a lot more listed in the second file, but not in Constants.pm

[07:12] <Xliff> I will regen and send a quick PR, then.

[07:13] <squashable6> 🍕 JJ++ synchronize pull request “Add magnetic permittivit…”: https://github.com/JJ/p6-math-constants/pull/9

[12:00] *** Hotkeys left
[12:03] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: that's not the most optimistic way to look at things! :)

[12:03] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I still like ake

[12:03] <AlexDaniel> I'm fine with ake

[12:04] <jmerelo> I mean, it's like looking for a parking space. You can pick whatever one you have handy, or you can go further and further away from your destination looking for an easier, or nicer, one.

[12:04] <AlexDaniel> but they're building a new parking lot over there! All I have to do is just wait a little bit!

[12:05] <AlexDaniel> :)

[12:05] <jmerelo> If eventually þerl is chosen (which it will, because it's the nicest), we can always change it back to þake. But it's been sake for some period of time, it might change to ake for a limited period...

[12:05] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right :-)

[12:05] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: ... then maybe perl6 gets a new alias, and we want to change it to whatever makes it more similar to that name... Or not, because everybody loves ake by then.

[13:03] <El_Che> Zoffix: your blog post is greatly appreciated

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> yes

[13:06] <AlexDaniel> I found it somewhat surprising that it didn't propose some specific alias

[13:06] <moritz> that's a very useful tactic

[13:06] <AlexDaniel> but I guess there's a reason for that

[13:06] <El_Che> yeah

[13:06] <moritz> because it means you aren't conflating calling for an alias with promoting one particular alias

[13:06] <moritz> +1 on that

[13:07] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[13:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[13:08] <El_Che> is als a more fundamental question to TimToady, than 1 specific name. 

[13:08] <El_Che> so you can be OK with an alias, but not ok with one specific one

[13:11] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I'd be OK with any alias as long as it doesn't have “perl” in it. I'm just too tired

[13:12] <kensanata> After all these years, I'm fortified!

[13:12] <kensanata> I started saying Perl 5 instead of Perl, for example...

[13:14] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: but do you write perl 6 with a non-breaking space? :P

[13:14] <CIAvash> How would an alias actually work? Everywhere(website, docs, excecutable, ...) mentions Perl 6 but we call it something else?

[13:15] <kensanata> AlexDaniel: I'm sure that's not part of the name, and no trademark registry would allow for it, so for all indents and purposes, even if you believed it to be necessary, it'd be a joke. 😛

[13:16] *** cognominal-p6 left
[13:16] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[13:16] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: I'm serious

[13:17] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: it doesn't need to be part of the trademark, I'm just asking if *you* write it with nbsp

[13:17] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[13:17] <kensanata> AlexDaniel: Of course not.

[13:17] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: because if you don't, and say you write a blog post

[13:17] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: then “Perl” and “6” can be broken into separate lines

[13:18] <AlexDaniel> which makes it look rather weird

[13:18] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: so for the documentation and everything, we try to use nbsp

[13:18] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: and we recommend others to do the same :)

[13:18] <kensanata> AlexDaniel: But doesn't that happen to all sorts of names? Even words are split accross lines. The question of typography is separate from the name.

[13:19] <kensanata> So having a convention saying please use a non-breaking space between A and B is fine, but the *name* still consists of A and B.

[13:19] <AlexDaniel> sure, yes

[13:20] <AlexDaniel> but I liked your “Of course not.” answer :)

[13:20] <kensanata> https://framapic.org/vzeEWQ3zMu8M/q6g4tmptm084.png

[13:21] <kensanata> I wanted to fix it, but now I'm going to leave it, as a statement.

[13:22] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: do you have compose key configured?

[13:22] <kensanata> Of course! Caps lock it is.

[13:22] <AlexDaniel> I think `compose space space` should give a non-breaking space on most systems

[13:23] <kensanata> Yes, that's true.

[13:23] <AlexDaniel> .tell jmerelo I'll take a little break and then will write a page for results

[13:23] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[13:23] <El_Che> In case TimToady is reading: please veto names with spaces in it, and everything needing a compose key :)

[13:24] <kensanata> Haha

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: but 🦋!

[13:24] <kensanata> Better limit ourselves to ASCII.

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> :)

[13:24] <moritz> what about  駱駝道? </troll>

[13:26] <kensanata> It's name is 🦋 but we call it "butterfly". 🦋 is the language, "butterfly" is the name of the language, because we don't want to use "Perl 6" since it's associated with "Perl" which other people might not like. Also, "Perl 6" is the name for a Perl programming language and "Perl 5" is also a name for a Perl programming language, but a different one. It's more like a set, not sequence…

[13:26] <El_Che> Ƭ̵̬̊ the artist formely known as prince-vibe

[13:27] <kensanata> El_Che: I'll admit it. This is cool.

[13:29] <CIAvash> Has anybody thought about what happens after an alias is chosen? Are there going to be any changes to the website and docs?

[13:30] <lizmat> I think everybody knows my stance in this

[13:31] <lizmat> I would also like to have people think about what this would mean for conferences and stands at conferences

[13:34] *** Zoffix joined
[13:34] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[13:34] <Zoffix> lizmat: I don't remember what your stance on it is. All I recall is you saying it won't happen

[13:34] <yoleaux> 10:13Z <brrt> Zoffix: Summation -> Summary, Numerious -> Numerous

[13:35] <Zoffix> lizmat: I don't see much happening with conferences, since it's not a rename.

[13:35] <timotimo> i'm 100% on board with getting a name that gives us the same acronym as brainfuck (re: butterfly)

[13:35] <El_Che> I think lizmat has a good point, Zoffix. But we'll cross that bridge if we get there

[13:35] <CIAvash> Because at the very least it can add a new layer of confusion, people hear name X and then see Perl 6 and wonder what that is about

[13:36] <Zoffix> CIAvash: I thought yes. We ban all blanket name changes and let people use whatever name they prefer when writing content. This will make one of the names superior to the other, based on the amount of use.

[13:38] <moritz> so, I visited a talk by Damian Conway, and the organizers told him not to use the name Perl until the end, because people might walk away

[13:38] <moritz> dunno if that was warranted, but he did

[13:38] <El_Che> moritz: whut?

[13:38] <Zoffix> El_Che: someone on Facebook brought that up as well. They posted a bunch of pictures of "PerlConf" and "The Perl Conference" and said the alias would affect it. What I don't understand is why a "Perl" (as opposed to "Perl 6") conference is a perfect fit. I can't know whether there will be any Perl 6 talks at all unless I look at the program. Same would be with the alias name. 

[13:38] <moritz> and called it "Albus", after a certain wizard, and because the language was pretty magical

[13:38] *** cognominal-p6 left
[13:38] <moritz> and I kinda liked it

[13:39] <moritz> short, has a positive annotation, and I'm not aware of other software with that name

[13:39] <El_Che> Zoffix: I don't think it will be a problem, but it will be something to take into account, in lizmat's conf role

[13:39] <moritz> El_Che: this talk was organized by Frankfurt.pm, but in collaboration with a pretty general web development conference, and hosted by a university

[13:40] <Zoffix> +1 on Albus, though I'd settle for any non-offensive, non-joke name that doesn't have whitespace or numbers in it :)

[13:40] <moritz> it's the first proposed alias for Perl 6 that I actually liked

[13:41] <El_Che> I am very fond of the rakudo name, but like zoffix I am in the everything-non-silly-is-better camp

[13:43] <CIAvash> Zoffix: what do you mean by "We ban all blanket name changes"?

[13:44] *** ChoHag left
[13:45] <Zoffix> CIAvash: like, no commits that just go in and change every instance of "Perl 6" to "Albus". 

[13:45] *** ChoHag joined

[13:46] <Zoffix> And I guess contested spaces (e.g. title of homepage) would just be the same as how bilingual countries do signs and stuf: "The Perl 6/Albus Programming Language"

[13:48] <pmurias> Zoffix: re why having joint Perl 5&6 conferences makes sense, the vast majority of Perl 5 people at conferences like Perl 6 and a lot of people are part of both communities

[13:49] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[13:50] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[13:50] *** vike1 left
[13:50] <Zoffix> pmurias: that wasn't my question tho.

[13:51] <CIAvash> Zoffix: if people call it whatever they want, wouldn't that make it hard to find the content? I'm a bit confused, if the amount of the usage of a name is important, where does TimToady come in?

[13:52] <Zoffix> pmurias: the question was: "Why is 'The Perl Conference' a perfect fit for a language named 'Perl 6'?" And that question was made in response to a claim that creating an alias would make it hard for people to find Alias conferences. Yet, they don't seem to have trouble finding them, without the language name being featured in the conferences right now

[13:53] <El_Che> to be blunt, the perl5+6 communities are to small to have separated conferences

[13:54] <Zoffix> CIAvash: by "whatever they want" I meant either "Perl 6" or $Alias. TimToady comes in to bless some particular alias so instead of using Camelia, Rakudo, Albus, the folks who don't want to use Perl 6 name can use a single thing

[13:54] <El_Che> for people that use both, it's an advantage :)

[13:54] <pmurias> Zoffix: 'The Perl Conference' name itself doesn't tell you if it's a Perl 5 or Perl 6 or both conference

[13:54] <Zoffix> pmurias: yes, that's my point

[13:55] <Zoffix> CIAvash: as for finding content, yes it's not ideal, but IMO overall still better than doing nothing, especially since currently DuckDuckGo gives you Perl 5 content when you search for "perl6 argv" for example, so it's not like search is perfect at the moment.

[13:56] <Zoffix> CIAvash: and a pro: using alias in search will give you recent content instead of all those deeply outdated old Perl 6 articles :)

[13:59] <Zoffix> And I'll take search problems over The Damian being told not to mention the name of the language any day :)

[13:59] * Zoffix returns to being sick &

[13:59] *** Zoffix left
[13:59] <pmurias> Zoffix: get well soon

[14:01] <pmurias> Zoffix: I understand why you want to do have an alias, but I think the choice of the alias is important, as a bad one doesn't seem like a win

[14:02] <moritz> I don't think anybody disagrees with that

[14:03] <moritz> but it might help to decouple the discussion "do we want an alias name, assuming a good one can be found?" from the discussion "what should the alias name be?"

[16:59] <jdv79_> i dont get the name thing.  its still a perl.  as soon as someone see sigils theyll know.  why try to obfu it...

[17:00] <timotimo> could also be basic

[17:00] <timotimo> or php

[17:02] <jdv79_> seems futile.  everything has perl in it.  modules.perl6, the irc chan names, the subreddit, etc...

[17:02] <jdv79_> like i said.  i dont get it;)

[17:09] <AlexDaniel> jdv79_: it depends, some people indeed see no problem with it. However, have you tried talking to somebody about perl 6?

[17:09] <AlexDaniel> was there any confusion?

[17:10] <jdv79_> no

[17:10] <jdv79_> its also in the code, the lang braid, tge gh artifacts, etc.

[17:10] <AlexDaniel> there was no confusion or you don't talk about perl 6?

[17:11] <jdv79_> i talk of perl6 all the time.  no confusion.

[17:11] <AlexDaniel> so let me get this straight

[17:11] <jdv79_> cause at the outset i say perl as you know it is p5.  im talking about p6.

[17:12] <jdv79_> any confusion is handled up front

[17:14] * AlexDaniel shrugs

[17:14] <AlexDaniel> that doesn't work for me

[17:14] <AlexDaniel> because in the end I'm the “perl guy” and stuff like that

[17:15] <lizmat> why can't you be the "rakudo" guy ?

[17:15] <jdv79_> how would you explain to someone the compiler calks this lang in the braid Perl6 but you call it foobar?

[17:15] <AlexDaniel> yes I'll take any alias once it is there

[17:16] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: why couldn't you be the "rakudo" guy *now* ?

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> because rakudo is a compiler, not the language

[17:17] <lizmat> so?

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> well, you see, I can play all kinds of games in the attempt to work around the confusion

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> but clarity is one of my goals when I speak

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> if I'm talking about the language, I want to call the language by its name

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> substituting it with the name of the compiler… is just weird

[17:19] <lizmat> is it?  I know 

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> so the person will go search for language rakudo and there's no language rakudo, it's perl 6

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> ah-ha, perl! OK now it's clear. Hehe

[17:19] <lizmat> plenty of people in the car business that are "ford" or "citroën" or "peugeot" or "fiat" people

[17:20] <lizmat> they're all car mechanics

[17:20] <lizmat> but they identify with the brand they know best

[17:21] <lizmat> and I do think you can apply such an analogy to Perl 6 / Rakudo / Fanlang / Niecza

[17:21] <AlexDaniel> ehhh… I don't know, maybe you're right

[17:22] <lizmat> "rakudo" 4 / 5 hits mention Perl 6 for me on google

[17:22] <lizmat> actually 5/5

[17:22] <lizmat> at DDG its 4/5

[17:23] <AlexDaniel> well if on November 1st I'm told that my favorite programming language is rakudo, I'm fine with that. I'll use it

[17:23] <lizmat> I'm telling you would be fine to use that now already  :-)

[17:24] <lizmat> Google / DDG will back you up that you're not fantasising  

[17:24] <AlexDaniel> I don't like muddying the distinction between the language and the compiler, not until Nov 1st at least…

[17:36] <El_Che> I get AlexDaniel's point about talking with other people. I have exactly the same experience.

[17:37] <El_Che> (About the rakudo name, I love it and I don't care about the lang/compiler collision if it means we get a good name)

[17:39] <El_Che> I am introducing perl6 in production in small CI/containers related tasks, but I refer the code as Rakudo and not Perl 6. The devops code is mostly Go, and the Perl 5 code some teams use is very old school Perl 5.

[17:39] <ugexe> I'm a software engineer. I've work as one for many years. I've work with many other software engineers. I've always been the Perl6 guy at the last 4 places I've worked ( before 6.c ). There has never in my professional career been any confusion between Perl and Perl6 with any of my colleagues. This has involved me teaching colleagues, invitings others such as jnthn to talk with colleagues, raising money from

[17:39] <ugexe> colleagues to go towards Perl6 advancements ( Sync sockets, atomic operations, Cro OpenAPI tooling ). 

[17:39] <yoleaux> 4 Jan 2018 16:17Z <tyil> ugexe: Do you want me to close the ticket I created, as its a dupe of #157

[17:39] <yoleaux> 20 Jul 2018 16:10Z <stmuk> ugexe: I don't seem to be able to install zef on windows

[17:39] <ugexe> The Perl name has *never* been a deteriment to any of these accomplishments, and if anything contributed towards these things happening at all. I think the seconds long snippet of larry mentioning the possiblity of an alias have been overblown. Why aren't alias backers out there testing their theory and emulating the Damian talk and making up a name and mentioning it at the end? But I'm not a marketer, i'm a

[17:39] <ugexe> software engineer, so maybe it doesn't matter what I think. Maybe making the language easier for marketers to market is worth looking like amateur hour.

[17:41] <timotimo> ugexe: sorry for being so cold on your speed improvements pullrequest for JSON::Fast; i'm hoping to give it another look-over soon, though i'm still not quite sure if i want parallelization to take place

[17:41] <El_Che> .tell araraloren ping me about the rakudo-pkg problem so we can have a look. Feel free to raise an issue in github

[17:41] <yoleaux> El_Che: I'll pass your message to araraloren.

[17:42] <ugexe> timotimo: i have no speed improvement PR. it was something about not turning Version.new(...) into (0,0) or something

[17:42] <ugexe> the PR itself is probably no good, but the problem behind it is probably worth thinking on

[18:22] <davidp> there is a module, iam new to perl 6, how to know if it is safe for use please ?

[18:22] <tobs> I have to say Curses::UI:from<Perl5> looks more convenient than what is in the p6 ecosystem. I haven't tried it out yet, though.

[18:23] <CIAvash> shmup: It means the json value is an item so you need to decontainerize it. In this case you can also use the list method on it. https://docs.perl6.org/routine/%3C%3E

[18:24] <tobs> davidp: hmm, "safe to use", I don't know. If you're not worried that it deletes all your files when you touch it or something like that, the modules has an example directory.

[18:24] <tobs> You can check that out, run some of the examples and see if it fits.

[18:25] <davidp> thanks i know that lib

[18:25] <shmup> love it, cool/thanks CIAvash

[20:01] <lizmat> hmmm

[20:01] <lizmat> CIAvash: that looks like a bug

[20:01] <lizmat> :a<b> should not be allowed

[20:02] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's a full-blown introduction to perl 6, written in proper Russian. I wonder what their inspiration was (were they looking at docs.perl6.org or something else?), but so far it looks original… which makes me wonder why didn't they publish it as a book or something like that

[20:02] <lizmat> m: my Int %h = "a", "b"  # it should give this

[20:03] <CIAvash> Yeah, I was expecting that too

[20:03] <lizmat> CIAvash: could you please create an issue for that ?

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> I'd love to provide feedback for that, though

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> for example they recommend .pl extension, which we nowadays avoid

[20:05] <CIAvash> There are other issues I haven't created yet as well! Maybe tomorrow

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> also nowhere in the file it talks about `spurt` or `slurp` and instead recommends `open`

[21:32] <uzl> I'm reading https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature and there are multiple sentences where one finds 'default default'. The sentences seem to make sense with only one 'default' so I'm wondering if it's a just a typo or some meaning behind it.

[21:34] <timotimo> default default actually makes sense in signatures

[21:34] <timotimo> if you have $foo = 5, then 5 is the default for $foo, but if you just use $foo? you'll get the default default instead

[21:35] <timotimo> though it'd surely be helpful - especially for non-native speakers - to point it out a little more clearly?

[21:36] <timotimo> the first occurence of "default default" seems to explain what that means, without explaining explicitly that a "default default" is A Thing™

[21:36] <uzl> yeah, it makes after you explained but at first sight it's like 'What?'.

[21:39] <mniip> "implicit default" perhaps

[21:39] <timotimo> i think that'd be an improvement

[23:18] <AlexDaniel> .tell jmerelo by any chance are you interested in this? http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-10-07#l884

[23:18] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[23:19] <AlexDaniel> uzl: is it public, by the way? Your translation I mean

[23:19] <timotimo> jnthn: i'm not sure i understand "there's still lots more to be had. which is a good job, since ..."; like, the "a good job" part?

[23:20] <uzl> AlexDaniel: https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/piensaperl6/ <- It has a link to the gitlab repo.

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> awesome, in LaTeX! jmerelo is the right person :)

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> as long as they have time of course

[23:23] <uzl> That's what I realized. JJ might not have the spare time to do so.

[23:24] <uzl> But I guess there's not rush.

[23:29] <yoleaux> timotimo: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[23:30] <k-man> morning

[23:30] <timotimo> greetings k-man 

[23:30] <k-man> p14 of learning perl6 says i can get info on perl6 language variables by doing "p6doc language/variables"

[23:30] <k-man> but its not found oh my system

[23:31] <k-man> ooh

[23:31] <k-man> maybe because i didn't source my .bashrc in that term

[23:31] <k-man> nope, that's not it

[23:31] <k-man> hi timotimo 

[23:34] <k-man> hmmm... p6doc should have a document about p6doc imho

[23:35] <k-man> p6doc on its own seems to work

[23:36] <timotimo> you may not yet have p6doc installed

[23:36] <k-man> i do have it, it works

[23:36] <timotimo> oh!

[23:36] <k-man> 'p6doc variables' seems to find a document

[23:37] <k-man> i think its a typo or outdated info in the book

[23:37] <timotimo> learing perl6 is really new, though

[23:37] <k-man> yeah

[23:38] <k-man> i know

[23:38] <timotimo> i haven't used the p6doc tool in a long long time

[23:38] <timotimo> all the perl6 doc stuff is on the doc.perl6.org site, too, if that helps :\

[23:41] <k-man> timotimo, yeah, i found it

[23:41] <k-man> just wanted to be sure it wasn't me doing it wrong, and more likely an error in the book

[23:41] <k-man> i sent an errata note

[23:45] *** HaraldJoerg joined
[23:45] *** itaipu joined
[23:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v HaraldJoerg

[23:46] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v itaipu

[23:46] *** HaraldJoerg1 left
[23:47] <[Coke]> k-man++

[23:48] <k-man> thanks [Coke]!

[23:49] <k-man> i found 2 errata and I'm only up to p14 :(

[23:49] <k-man> should have done this before it was printed

[23:56] <ugexe> re perl 5&6 having conferences/summits split up -- how many conferences do you attend? because i really hope that such an argument is coming from attendees. or donating for p6 developers to go to PTS

[23:58] <ugexe> or do we just expect this shit to figure itself out?
