[00:03] <vrurg> timotimo: if you're here by occasion: my earlier question on StackOverflow is seemingly macOS/darwin dependant. Closure is not lost on my vboxed Linux Mint.

[00:04] <jeek> ugh

[00:04] <jeek> Tried Julia

[00:05] <jeek> Arrays starting at 1 ftl

[00:05] <timotimo> but is it blazing fast?

[00:05] <jeek> No idea, I got two Euler problems in before my gag reflex kicked in over the array thing, haven't gone back yet.

[00:07] <timotimo> but is that any better than saying "i won't use perl because sigils are terrible"? :)

[00:08] <timotimo> then again, i have an irrational desire not to use lua for the same reason

[00:11] <jeek> I was also irked by UNICODE operators. ‚äª is the bitwise xor operator. :D

[08:55] <ChoHag> How can I install modules with filenames instead of numbers?

[08:55] <moritz> ChoHag: what do you actually want to achieve?

[08:56] <ChoHag> site (and vendor) directories who's contents filenames are not a hash.

[08:58] <moritz> well, that's how Perl 6 modules are installed. Why does that bother you?

[08:59] <ChoHag> Because I have a folder containing 100s of files with no indication what they are.

[09:00] *** graphene left
[09:00] <ChoHag> Are you saying that it's essential and not just some sort of optimisation?

[09:00] <moritz> yes; it has to do with the fact that not all Perl 6 module names can be accurately reflected in file names

[09:01] <ChoHag> So because 100% readable wasn't possible they went with 0% readable?

[09:01] *** graphene joined
[09:01] <moritz> "they" aka "us" went with something that works

[09:02] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v graphene

[09:02] <moritz> and it's quite an engineering feat that the module system works, and works fairly fast, with all the constraints placed on it

[09:02] <ChoHag> It doesn't work for browing the filesystem.

[09:02] <ChoHag> +s

[09:02] <moritz> why do you feel you need to browse the filesystem?

[09:04] <ChoHag> Sorry is that a real question?

[09:04] <ChoHag> That's what the filesystem is _for_.

[10:56] <ChoHag> Postgres' data store isn't scripts I'm expecting to read, execute or find specific things in.

[11:02] <timotimo> if you know what you're looking for, you can "zef locate"

[11:02] <timotimo> but the compunit repo also contains all the precompiledbinaries

[11:02] <timotimo> also, editing the sources in a CUR is a Big No No

[11:03] <timotimo> and the filenames in the source archive don't necessarily correspond to their "actual names", which is what's in the "provides" section of the META6.info

[11:37] <Zoffix> ChoHag: the modules are installed as precompiled binary blobs. You aren't meant to "read, execute or find specific things in" the installed blobs. They don't even have to be files and there's a joke that you could have repo that reads data from /dev/random as a source of modules. I think source of the modules is in fact kept somewhere, but that's merely to provide more useful errors that include line numbers

[11:37] <Zoffix> to modules. Modifying those source files won't change the installed module.

[11:38] <Zoffix> ChoHag: you can use `zef look Some::Module` command to fetch the module's source and play with it and I think `zef locate Some::Module` will give the sha dir location that has the source in it as well, but as mentioned, modifying it won't change the installed module

[11:41] <Zoffix> (to clarify, by "play with it" I meant you'd include that source dir with `use lib` or `-I.`; making changes to it won't change the installed module)

[13:28] <tbrowder__> i‚Äôm working in rakudo nqp land and have a compiler hang on a ‚Äúmake‚Äù command. no noted errors, just still hanging after almost an hour. i can ping the make host from another host but, so far, i haven‚Äôt been able to get access to find out what is happening. eventually i will try the process on a host with much more memory (the hanging host only has 4 Gb). note i am buildng only for moar.

[13:29] <tbrowder__> the hang is occurring in the mast stage.

[13:30] <tbrowder__> i will give more details when i have them.

[13:31] <tbrowder__> any good hints for debugging?

[13:32] <tbrowder__> the hang came after i added a debug function in Pod.nqp to unbox an object i want to inspect.

[13:32] <diakopter> tbrowder__: usually that means there's some leftover process locking a file; look at your process list and kill anything leftover from a prior run

[19:23] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[19:24] <kensanata> Now that I'm trying to understand the code generated by cro stub, how do I find and read the documentation on my system for a libary like Cro::HTTP::Router, for example? I'm so very used to man, I guess.

[19:32] <MasterDuke> kensanata: perl6doc Cro::HTTP::Router should just work if you installed star

[19:35] <kensanata> MasterDuke: It doesn't. Do you know where I should be seeing the perl6doc program? It's not in ~/rakudo/install/bin where perl6 and moar and some other binaries are.

[19:37] *** cognominal-p6 left
[19:38] <MasterDuke> hm, maybe it's p6doc?

[19:38] <geekosaur> it's called p6doc, and it's aseparate install

[19:39] <MasterDuke> huh, thought it was bundled with rakudo star

[19:40] <geekosaur> hm, dunno about star, sorry

[19:41] <kensanata> Hm. I used zef search p6doc and found 1 result. Tried zef install p6doc and it says All candidates are currently installed. So I guess it is *somewhere* on my system. :)

[19:43] <MasterDuke> what does `zef locate p6doc` say?

[19:43] <kensanata> OK, there's /home/alex/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/bin/p6doc which isn't on my path. 

[19:43] <kensanata> MasterDuke: "===> From Distribution: p6doc:ver<1.002001>:auth<>:api<>"

[19:44] <kensanata> OK, works now. Thanks for the push in the right direction!
