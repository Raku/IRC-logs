[10:14] <yoleaux> 23 Aug 2018 23:33Z <TimToady> lizmat: I didn't see any fix.  The .. operator is currently specced to translate to ... when iterated, and ... is operating as designed.  We could make .. behave differently, but then we might break any current code that relies on '000000' .. '177777' to generate all the octals.

[14:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «class A␤»

[14:28] <uzl> I'm quite confused here. I thought submethods couldn't be inherited by child classes.

[14:28] <TimToady> it isn't, but attribute accessors are

[14:28] <yoleaux> 10:19Z <lizmat> TimToady: fwiw, I was surprised by the behaviour.  And I haven't been able to see any documentation or tests for it  :-(

[14:28] <yoleaux> 10:21Z <lizmat> TimToady: changing the "AAS" .. "ABS" (Range) behaviour, did not set off any spectests

[14:29] <TimToady> building B entails building A, which sets the attribute, which the .name accessor can get to

[14:29] <TimToady> m: class A { has $!name; submethod TWEAK() { $!name = 'class A' } }; class B is A { }; say B.new().name();

[14:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «No such method 'name' for invocant of type 'B'. Did you mean any of these?␤    none␤    note␤    take␤␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:30] <jnthn> Or if the surprise is that the submethod is called, it's because BUILDALL calls the BUILD and TWEAK submethods all the way down the class hierarchy

[14:31] <jnthn> That's why to write initialization logic there: it'll still be run reliably even if there's a subclass

[14:34] <TimToady> and the submethod is used there instead of a method because submethods only apply infrastructural changes at the one level the submethod knows about, and not at any other level, which would happen if you accidentally used 'method' instead

[14:34] *** skids joined
[14:34] <TimToady> m: class A { has $!name; method TWEAK() { $!name = 'class A' } }; class B is A { }; say B.new().name();

[14:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «class A␤»

[14:35] <TimToady> hmm, that should probably fail better

[14:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v skids

[14:36] <TimToady> it looks like the initializer is assuming TWEAK is a submethod, when it isn't

[14:37] <jnthn> The fail there was just because you declared $!name, not $.name, no?

[14:37] <TimToady> no, the last one should fail, methinks

[14:38] <jnthn> It just does a lookup and calls what it finds at that level, whether or not it's inherited.

[14:38] <TimToady> it's acting like a submethod because of its name, seemingly, not because of a 'submethod' decl

[14:38] <TimToady> why didn't it fail when called from B then?

[14:38] <TimToady> since the attr is private?

[14:38] <jnthn> Why would it fail? There's a method TWEAK visible from B

[14:39] <TimToady> B shouldn't be able to set $!name

[14:39] <jnthn> It can't

[14:39] <TimToady> then why didn't it blow up?

[14:39] <jnthn> It just does B.^lookup('TWEAK') and since the TWEAK in A is visible from there it finds it

[14:40] <TimToady> I guess cause it's defined in the same class...

[14:40] <jnthn> Right

[14:40] <jnthn> It's just normal inheritance semantics

[14:40] <TimToady> but we're calling it twice instead of once, which is suboptimal, I guess

[14:40] <jnthn> S12, iirc, even says that you *can* write a normal method, you just better know what you're doing. I'm not actually sure how you would write one that is sensible, mind :)

[14:41] <TimToady> well, it'd have to smart about 6model and stuff

[14:41] <jnthn> Yeah, but it's not clear that it knows what "level" it's being called on

[14:41] <jnthn> Or can find that out

[14:41] <jnthn> Since `self` is of the type of the object we're constructing

[14:41] <TimToady> maybe we should just have a (suppressible) warning if you define a BUILD/TWEAK as a method

[14:42] <jnthn> That'd work for me. I've only ever done it by accident :)

[14:42] <TimToady> method TWEAK is intentional-darn-it (...) {...}

[14:45] <uzl> "TimToady: building B entails building A, which sets the attribute, which the .name accessor can get to". Oh, that makes sense. I didn't even think about that.

[14:46] <uzl> I'm just getting the rope of it so my bad if my question is kind of basic/naive. :)

[14:46] <uzl> Thanks for being so helpful!

[14:46] <TimToady> no problem, took us years to detangle all this at the start :)

[14:47] <TimToady> and we didn't even quite get BUILD right, which is why there's now a TWEAK :)

[16:32] <sarna> hey, how can I match only the first letters of words using a regex? I've been trying for quite some time now but I can't get it right :^(

[16:33] <timotimo> so you want to express something like "the letters xyz and then any amount of any word letters"?

[16:34] <sarna> no, something like "an example sentence" -> matches 'a', 'e' and 's'

[16:35] *** inbioz left
[16:35] <benjikun> m: say 'asdf apple american' ~~ /[(\w)\w+' ']+/;

[16:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «｢asdf apple ｣␤ 0 => ｢a｣␤ 0 => ｢a｣␤»

[16:35] <benjikun> whoops, only matches with the space

[16:35] <timotimo> how about using the % operator here?

[16:35] <timotimo> seems like a perfect situation

[16:36] <timotimo> alternatively, use comb

[16:36] <timotimo> especially if you're only interested in the string anyway

[16:36] <timotimo> m: say "asdf beetle cellophane diogenes".comb(/«(\w)\w+»/)

[16:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «(asdf beetle cellophane diogenes)␤»

[16:36] <benjikun> true, `%` seems good

[16:36] <timotimo> oops wrong one

[16:36] <benjikun> if you want regex, that is

[16:36] <timotimo> m: say "asdf beetle cellophane diogenes".comb(/« <( \w )> \w+ »/)

[16:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «(a b c d)␤»

[16:37] <sarna> very nice, thanks :^)

[16:37] <avuserow> m: say "foo bar qux".comb: /<|w>(\w)/;

[16:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar ea387a12a: OUTPUT: «(f b q)␤»

[16:37] <timotimo> <( and )> let you get only a part of the matched stuff even in a comb, without having to use <?after> and <?before>

[16:37] <timotimo> that's also good

[16:37] <timotimo> ah, especially since my regex up there won't match any words with only a single letter

[16:37] <timotimo> would have to be a * rather than a +

[16:38] <avuserow> <|w> is a word boundary, like \b in p5 and some other engines

[16:38] <sarna> that explains many things
