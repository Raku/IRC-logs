[00:16] <ingy> usually takes me an hour or so to fix the accumulated wiki errors that crash the crawler...

[00:16] <timotimo> haha, ouch

[00:17] <ingy> just little sloppy errors. usually I fix the wiki pages. once in a whiile I tweak the crawler.

[00:48] <ingy> timotimo: I just talked a friend into pairing on the RosettaCodeData update tonight :)

[00:48] <timotimo> that sounds like fun!

[00:48] <ingy> should go faster that way

[00:49] <ingy> oh yeah? maybe I'll talk you into it next time. :)

[00:49] <timotimo> i'm hoping more for in-person pair programming, actually. i reckon i'm rather far from you at the moment :)

[00:49] <ingy> where are you?

[00:49] <timotimo> germany

[00:50] <ingy> where?

[00:50] <timotimo> i seem to recall you were going to a TPC?

[00:50] <timotimo> karlsruhe

[00:50] <ingy> yeah, but I'm thinking about germany after yapc::eu

[00:50] <ingy> most of my favorite pairs are there :)

[00:51] <timotimo> .o( pairs of feet )

[00:51] <ingy> I just finished pairing with tobs, who is from .de

[00:52] <ingy> ah, one of my favorite yaml hackers is from stuttgart

[00:53] <ingy> I waas hoping to get there to see him

[00:54] <ingy> and tinita++ is working in heidelberg now, iirc

[00:57] <ingy> and not far from lizmat++

[00:57] <ingy> and ribasushi ?

[00:57] <timotimo> oh, i believe i saw ribasushi at the GPN18, but I was too shy&awkward to approach :(

[00:57] <ingy> heh

[00:58] <ingy> ribasushi is fantastic

[00:58] <ingy> I hope you aren't too shy to hack with me if I make it out there

[00:58] <timotimo> i've spoken to him before, not sure when that was, but it was most likely a GPW, SPW, or APW.

[00:59] <ingy> 2001  was my last GPW

[00:59] <ingy> :)

[00:59] <ingy> predates #perl6

[01:00] <ingy> iirc I started this channel in Dec 2005

[01:00] <ingy> or thereabouts

[01:17] <timotimo> i might actually go sleep and review it again in the morning before i post it

[01:18] <ingy> does your irc stay connected?

[01:18] <timotimo> yup

[01:18] <ingy> I'll message you if I have any thoughts

[01:44] *** mcmillhj left
[01:44] <MasterDuke> good post

[01:45] <ingy> s/mistery/misery/

[01:46] <ingy> maybe mistery == mystery | misery

[01:47] <ingy> I might start saying "mistery solved" more often

[01:48] <MasterDuke> maybe a mistery is a place where one can go to get misted

[01:48] <ingy> Elliott Smith has the song Miss Misery. Ingy d√∂t Net is Mister Mistery.

[01:48] <MasterDuke> like they have at stadiums and amusement parks and such

[01:49] <Juerd> benjikun: Yes, but did you know there are several other Perl 6 books already available?

[01:49] <benjikun> Yeah, I know

[01:49] <benjikun> Maybe having more books under O'Reilly will gather more attention for Perl6, though

[01:49] <ingy> benjikun: what's the animal?

[01:50] <ingy> I thought books went out of style in at the end of the last millenium...

[01:50] <benjikun> Butterfly

[01:51] <ingy> a giant one?

[01:51] <benjikun> https://www.learningperl6.com/images/cover.png

[01:51] <benjikun> I'm no butterfly expert, but it looks fairly large to me

[02:48] <timotimo> so while i was trying and failing to fall asleep, it occured to me that perhaps examples.perl6.org ought to be upgraded one or two steps for the book release user influx

[02:50] <timotimo> 1) maybe put tags on examples, 2) make examples immediately runnable in glot.io or similar services, 3) perhaps put dates of creation on our examples more prominently, so Very Old examples stand out as "maybe not the best thing to look at", 4) maybe put a huge portion of rosettacode examples up on that site; currently we have only 12

[02:51] <timotimo> also, do something about the top bar with the tabs; i have my browser set to 150% zoom by default, and it wraps into two lines, which is kinda weird :)

[02:52] <timotimo> on top of that, have a "try in your browser" page on perl6.org, with a prominent way to find it from the perl6.org front page

[02:53] <timotimo> maybe give the examples at the bottom a button that evals it on glot.io or similar

[02:53] <timotimo> huggable: try

[02:53] <huggable> timotimo, https://tio.run/#perl6 https://glot.io/new/perl6 https://f.perlbot.pl/#perl6 https://ideone.com/ https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bduggan/p6-jupyter-kernel/master?filepath=eg%2Fhello-world.ipynb

[02:54] <timotimo> ugh, we should probably have a much shorter link for the last one

[02:56] <timotimo> also, if we run all the examples through --target=ast we can surely have lists of example programs that use any given thing in the doc.perl6.org site and we could make them discoverable that way?

[03:16] <benjikun> timotimo: What do you think about having the "try it in your browser" type thing linked or embedded on the frontpage of perl6.org like how golang/dart/rust has

[03:16] <timotimo> i don't know how golang/dart/rust have it, but yes!

[03:17] <benjikun> https://golang.org/

[03:17] <benjikun> Something like this

[03:17] <benjikun> or we could have a link next to the examples shown on perl6.org that says something along the lines of "try it for yourself"

[03:17] <timotimo> wow, that is extremely prominent

[03:18] <benjikun> mhm

[03:21] <timotimo> hm, i wonder if people would appreciate being able to turn off syntax highlighting on our sites

[03:24] <benjikun> perhaps

[03:24] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues/24 - please feel very free to edit my potentially incoherent rambling into something that makes more sense

[03:25] <timotimo> also, i kind of want to build a little course based on mybinder.org for people new to perl6, maybe as a screencast (because i've kind of always wanted to make screencasts)

[03:25] <benjikun> The example page shouldn't list the examples in the "File", "Title", "Author" tables imo

[03:25] <timotimo> being able to asynchronously communicate with html/js that you also put into the notebooks is a feature with a *lot* of potential in my eyes

[03:27] <benjikun> hm

[03:27] <timotimo> did you see that? bduggan++ had a presentation about it and it kind of blew my mind

[03:28] <benjikun> No, I didn't

[03:28] <benjikun> Could I snatch a link from ya

[05:08] <u-ou> what's perl 6 for open(my $fh, 'foo | bar | moo |');?

[05:13] <El_Che> I don't use that often with open, but with run

[05:13] <El_Che> here is an example using async: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proc::Async (grep on piping)

[05:14] <u-ou> ty

[05:15] <El_Che> shell understand piping with the commands, but that's not what you're asking

[07:54] <moritz> most likely, yes

[07:54] <lookatme> IDK :)

[07:55] <lookatme> a kind of butterfly ?

[07:55] <lookatme> I've heard that long time ago

[07:55] <lizmat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali

[07:56] <sarna> will it be different for every edition? like, Diwali - 6.d, ?? - 6.e ? or Diwali all the way

[07:56] <lookatme> hmm, yeah, Diwali is a festival 

[07:56] <lookatme> I prefer the name of butterfly :)

[08:03] <AlexDaniel> moritz: what?

[08:04] <AlexDaniel> where is that info coming from?

[08:04] <moritz> old #perl6 lore

[08:04] <AlexDaniel> that ‚ÄúDiwali‚Äù is even proposed as an alias

[08:04] *** benjikun left
[08:05] <AlexDaniel> definitely not here https://github.com/perl6/6.d-prep/blob/master/TODO/README.md#language-extended-naming

[08:05] <El_Che> The alias discussion is not about the compiler version

[08:05] <El_Che> more a marketing thing

[08:05] <AlexDaniel> and who is talking about the compiler version?

[08:05] <El_Che> something to stay and not change with every compiler spec bump

[08:05] <AlexDaniel> ok look‚Ä¶ let's deconfuse this

[08:06] <AlexDaniel> rakudo compiler versions are 2018.02, 2018.03, 2018.03, etc.

[08:06] <AlexDaniel> *language* has its own releases: v6.c (Christmas), v6.d (Diwali), etc.

[08:06] <AlexDaniel> these are versions, but the language itself is Perl¬†6

[08:06] *** scimon joined
[08:07] <AlexDaniel> now, there's also a discussion on whether language ‚ÄúPerl¬†6‚Äù should have an alias, or simply another name

[08:07] <AlexDaniel> it could be ‚Äú6lang‚Äù or ‚Äúpsix‚Äù or something else

[08:07] <AlexDaniel> but not ‚ÄúDiwali‚Äù, at least I don't remember anyone proposing that. And in fact, that would confuse things ever more

[08:09] <AlexDaniel> and there's no single clear candidate at the moment

[08:09] <AlexDaniel> sarna: does that make sense? ‚Üë

[08:09] <AlexDaniel> also I noticed that I wrote 2018.03 twice, heh :)

[08:10] <sarna> AlexDaniel: yes, thanks :)

[08:11] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I've always liked √ûerl

[08:11] <AlexDaniel> u: √û

[08:11] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+00DE LATIN CAPITAL LETTER THORN [Lu] (√û)

[08:12] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: oh ye, I remember that. Therl :)

[08:12] <lookatme> not easy to type

[08:12] <sarna> üÖ±Ô∏èerl so we're hip and trendy

[08:12] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: It looks like a P, but better (because it's Icelandic, and everything in Iceland is better), it's pronounceable (th), makes for a nice extension (.√û), and, well, it's just cool

[08:13] <AlexDaniel> lookatme: Therl would be the ascii alternative I guess

[08:13] <jmerelo> sarna: that's ver cool to.

[08:13] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right

[08:13] <AlexDaniel> in fact, my compose key already gives √æ for compose t h

[08:13] <lookatme> Therl ? hmm

[08:13] <AlexDaniel> u: √û√æ

[08:13] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+00DE LATIN CAPITAL LETTER THORN [Lu] (√û)

[08:15] <lookatme> it looks like posix :)

[08:15] <El_Che> good morning

[08:16] <sarna> well, it kinda fits

[08:16] <lookatme> afternoon here :)

[08:16] <sarna> "apsik" is the sneezing onomatopoeia in Polish

[08:16] <sarna> it fits too

[08:16] <AlexDaniel> sarna: psix a lot of people like, for some reason. ‚Ä¶ but the moment it was proposed we've seen ‚Äúpee sex‚Äù jokes going around immediately‚Ä¶ not cool

[08:16] <sarna> AlexDaniel: oh well

[08:17] <sarna> AlexDaniel: on the other hand, "Python"..

[10:49] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: what should I do with https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/pull/329 ?

[10:49] <AlexDaniel> merge it first and then docs will materialize?

[10:49] <AlexDaniel> or wait for the docs first because otherwise they won't ever‚Ä¶ :)

[10:50] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I'll try to do them...

[10:50] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: to tell you the truth, I didn't have time to test it extensively

[10:50] <jmerelo> So let me check and document it, probably some problem will arise and I'll have to do some stuff.

[10:50] <jmerelo> Sorry about that...

[10:51] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: actually, now that I think about it, https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/288 does not need docker

[10:51] <AlexDaniel> or what was the issue‚Ä¶

[10:51] <AlexDaniel> the issue was that it is reaaaally sloooow?

[10:51] <AlexDaniel> hmm‚Ä¶

[10:52] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: yep. And some parts not really testable...

[10:52] <AlexDaniel> but that's ok

[10:52] <AlexDaniel> according to https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/issues/122

[10:52] <jmerelo> Docker will also help with deployment... 

[10:53] <AlexDaniel> bisectable6, committable6, evalable6, unicodable6, notable6 and benchable6 are testable!

[10:53] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=6439415) the exit code is 1 and the output is identical as well

[10:53] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/a68a29f7a8ce42266e8e8a4b40264c0b

[10:53] * AlexDaniel facepalms

[10:53] <jmerelo> Yep, but docker can also help with that. Download container, fire it up, you've got bot running.

[10:53] <AlexDaniel> these are the main bots pretty much, we shouldn't worry too much about others

[10:54] *** zakharyas left
[10:54] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: OK, I'll test them...

[10:55] *** zakharyas joined
[10:56] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I'm all for dockerizing, just saying that it's not a blocker

[10:56] <AlexDaniel> although‚Ä¶ maybe it'll help with travis time limits

[10:56] <AlexDaniel> if no time is spent on building rakudo and modules, then more time is available for running tests

[10:57] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: of course. It will shave 15 minutes off travis, that's it.

[10:58] <jmerelo> If that's what it takes, OK. If travis takes > 65 minutes, well...

[10:58] * AlexDaniel has no idea what kind of machines travis is using

[10:59] <AlexDaniel> ‚ÄúWhen a job on a public repository takes longer than 50 minutes.‚Äù

[15:03] <hoelzro> I suppose I should try OpenBSD

[15:05] <El_Che> hoelzro: wanted to look at it today, but didn't find the time

[15:06] <sarna_> > my constant LIBLINENOISE = %?RESOURCES<libraries/linenoise>.Str; - maybe that's the Nil that's used in Str context?

[15:06] <El_Che> the latest ubuntu has a "minimal" install, in the case something is missing at runtime

[15:06] <hoelzro> sarna, El_Che: that's a good point

[15:06] <hoelzro> I would bet that's it

[15:06] <hoelzro> I wonder if the linenoise library is linking against something that isn't available

[15:07] <sarna_> probably

[15:07] <hoelzro> but you'd think that it would still be in %?RESOURCES...

[15:07] <El_Che> which seems to be an empty key

[15:07] <timotimo> oh hey hoelzro 

[15:08] <hoelzro> hey timotimo! how's it going?

[15:08] <timotimo> something's telling me you might be interested in bduggan's presentation on perl 6 on the jupyter notebook

[15:08] <timotimo> oh i've been better. how about you?

[15:08] <hoelzro> I've been sick all week, but other than that, pretty good

[15:09] <hoelzro> my wife and I are expecting a baby soon, so that's exciting

[15:09] <hoelzro> I would definitely be interested in that presentation!

[15:10] <hoelzro> thanks!

[15:10] <hoelzro> thanks sarna_ !

[15:11] <sarna_> http://code.activestate.com/lists/activeperl/21354/ - is it true for perl6?

[15:12] <geekosaur> perl 6 is fine with hyphens. And whoever wrote that is short just a bit of history, among other things

[15:13] <geekosaur> COBOL supported dashes.

[15:13] <geekosaur> there's admittedly not many that do, but perl 6 definitely does

[15:13] <sena_kun> m: unit module My-Nice-R'lyeh;

[15:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: ( no output )

[15:13] <geekosaur> there's a small number of others, but most folks took the lazy way out of parsing identifiers vs. expressions

[15:13] <timotimo> when I die, please scatter my dashes on Io.

[15:14] <raschipi> Lisp also supports it.

[15:15] <sarna_> oh well

[15:15] <sarna_> because I'm making a connect four game for the command line as an exercise

[15:15] <sarna_> and my tool created a App::connect::four project

[15:17] <El_Che> cheers, hoelzro 

[15:17] *** rindolf left
[15:17] <El_Che> the lower case looks weird

[15:18] <geekosaur> m: unit module App::Connect-Four;

[15:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: ( no output )

[15:19] <El_Che> m: unit module App::ConnectFour;

[15:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: ( no output )

[15:19] <sarna_> El_Che: do you use uppercase for this? heck, I could really use a style guide

[15:19] <hoelzro> El_Che: thanks!

[15:19] <geekosaur> mixed case is a good idea because all the same case tends to mean pragma

[15:20] <geekosaur> but it's all one identifier (if not, it's a bug somewhere) so "App::" covers that

[15:20] <geekosaur> still, as style goes mixed case is preferred

[15:20] <sarna_> 'App::ConnectFour' would be alright? how to name my github repo?

[15:22] <El_Che> app-connectfour, AppConnectFour, p6-app-connectfour, etc

[15:22] <El_Che> many possiilitie

[15:22] <El_Che> s:)

[15:23] <sarna_> oh well, thanks

[15:23] *** rindolf joined
[15:23] <El_Che> I tend to go for the first style

[15:24] <sarna_> it looks the best imo

[15:25] <sarna_> yeah

[15:26] <El_Che> e

[15:30] *** p6noob joined
[15:31] <p6noob> Arrays are passed by reference to subs which allows the sub to alter their contents.  Is there a sub signature that promises the caller the array will not be altered.  Can perl6 enforce such a restriction on a sub?

[15:31] *** kybr left
[15:32] <jnthn> is copy

[15:32] <jnthn> m: sub foo(@a is copy) { @a[1]++ }; my @x = 1..5; foo(@x); say @x

[15:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: OUTPUT: ¬´[1 2 3 4 5]‚ê§¬ª

[15:33] <p6noob> jnthn, makes sense.  is it okay performance wise to make a copy?  maybe it's a lazy copy?

[15:34] <jnthn> Depends how big the array is. Also it can't really be very lazy since that also risks action at a distance.

[15:34] <p6noob> jnthn: yeah, would be nice to have the "readonly" attribute work to do the same thing without needing a copy

[15:35] <jnthn> Yes, but how would that actually work?

[15:35] <p6noob> but it seems to only protect the reference itself, not the contents.

[15:35] <El_Che> can binding do something there?

[15:36] <p6noob> jnthn, i don't know. 

[15:36] *** kybr joined
[15:36] <geekosaur> no, because you're binding to the container for the array, not the containers within it

[15:36] <geekosaur> which is why "is copy" is the only real option

[15:37] <El_Che> geekosaur: thx

[15:37] <p6noob> okay.. thanks for the help.

[15:37] <sarna_> what if the array was a const? would I be able to change stuff within it?

[15:38] <geekosaur> if the array itself is constructed to not have r/w containers, you can't chaneg it

[15:38] <geekosaur> although I think then you don;t have an array, you have a list?

[15:38] <geekosaur> or a seq

[15:39] <sarna_> oh

[15:39] <jnthn> Yes, a List can't be modified

[15:39] <jnthn> Well, unless it contains mutable things inside of it of course :)

[15:40] <El_Che> a list o constants

[15:40] <El_Che> is copy is looking good :)

[15:40] <jnthn> In theory we could have some kind of "wrap the array up in something that doesn't let you modify it"

[15:40] <El_Che> an object

[15:40] <El_Che> it's already there

[15:41] <jnthn> Well, I meant as something a signature could declaratively do, and that'd intercept the AT-POS and so on

[15:41] <El_Che> is ro

[15:41] <sarna_> wrap it in an object that has only getters?

[15:41] <jnthn> But that brings its own problems. For one, it isn't the same type that was passed.

[15:41] <El_Che> yes, that was what I was thinking. The array should be a private attribute

[15:41] <sarna_> ah, right

[15:42] <jnthn> And yes, doing good OO design (and following the tell-don't-ask principle) can also help :)

[15:43] <jnthn> Trouble is a lot of OO doesn't help in this regard at all because it has a load of getters/setters, so there's no real data hiding.

[15:43] <El_Che> protcting against casual changes is often enough

[15:45] *** perlpilot joined
[15:45] <jnthn> Can be. If using an object boundary as a concurrency control boundary, however, one needs to be very strict on these things. :)

[19:01] <El_Che> should it link to linenoise?

[19:02] <hoelzro> no - linenoise should be bundled in there

[19:02] <El_Che> install seems to work on the container

[19:03] <hoelzro> wth

[19:03] <kjk> moritz: thanks, good to know. Is there some kind of automatic generation of doc templates for each routine, so that we know what's documented and what's not, and just need to fill in the doc in a generated skeleton .pod file or something

[19:03] <El_Che> I could nuke ~/.perl6 and then my rakudo install

[19:04] <hoelzro> I'm tempted to say "go for it", but I don't want to lose this environment

[19:05] <hoelzro> I wonder if it has something to do with a global install under /opt and modules under ~/.perl6...

[19:05] *** MasterDuke joined
[19:05] <El_Che> the error when the repl is run is weird: I ran into a problem while trying to set up Linenoise: Must specify something as a path: did you mean '.' for the current directory?

[19:06] *** sarna joined
[19:06] <El_Che> hoelzro: the only module in /opt is zef

[19:06] <sarna> hoelzro: yes! iirc openSUSE doesn't use ext4, I'll tell you in 10 minutes though

[19:06] <hoelzro> I'm guessing it's because the path to the .so is Nil, so the nativecall loader is doing what it can with that

[19:06] <El_Che> and it's not the same zef as the one installing Linenoise in  ~/.perl6

[19:06] <hoelzro> sarna: sounds good

[19:06] <hoelzro> oh, that's interesting

[19:07] <El_Che> $ which zef

[19:07] <El_Che> /home/claudio/.perl6/bin/zef

[19:07] <moritz> kjk: iirc there's a tool that creates a new, mostly empty pod file for a type, but it's not pre-filled with all methods

[19:07] <hoelzro> sarna: when you have a chance, could you look for those files El_Che and I were talking about above?

[19:08] *** eliasr left
[19:08] <sarna> hoelzro: could you please specify? I've been offline for a while

[19:08] <hoelzro> sure - I would like to see if you have 91857A0CE92503F53D56DEBB6F633402878D0FF0 somewhere in your modules directory

[19:09] <El_Che> hoelzro: f....hell

[19:09] <El_Che> $ sudo PATH=/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin:$PATH /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/zef install Linenoise

[19:09] <El_Che> ...

[19:09] <El_Che> ===> Installing: Linenoise:ver<0.1.1>:auth<Rob Hoelz>

[19:09] <El_Che> (ok)

[19:10] <hoelzro> interesting...

[19:10] <El_Che> but perl6 repl is still broken

[19:10] <El_Che> probably because using the local one

[19:10] <El_Che> let me fix that

[19:10] <hoelzro> yeah

[19:11] <El_Che> nope

[19:11] <El_Che> no install errors, but still broken

[19:11] <hoelzro> interesting

[19:11] <El_Che> I ran into a problem while trying to set up Linenoise: Must specify something as a path: did you mean '.' for the current directory?

[19:12] <hoelzro> well, I'm thinking it has something to do with a global install of Perl 6 (and potentially zef) and a local install of Linenoise

[19:12] <El_Che> the undef value may be a red herring

[19:12] <hoelzro> so I'm going to start sleuthing in that direction

[19:13] <El_Che> the user's zef is installed like this: /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/zef --install-to=home install zef

[19:13] <El_Che> nothing fancy

[19:13] <hoelzro> I'm going to go offline for a bit - need to walk the dog and take a nap to try and beat this cold

[19:13] <El_Che> get better, thx for your time!

[19:13] <hoelzro> thanks for helping me walk through this issue!

[19:14] <El_Che> don't mention it

[20:42] <benjikun> timotimo: Want to work on improving examples.perl6.org today?

[20:47] <timotimo> do you have good ideas?

[20:49] <timotimo> there wasn't yet a reaction to my issue in the user-experience repo

[20:50] <timotimo> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ƒ•elp my cat is puting her paws on the keyboard

[20:50] <benjikun> lol

[20:50] <benjikun> cute

[20:51] *** wamba joined
[20:51] <benjikun> Well, here's the class for the highlighting on the frontpage of perl6.org: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/blob/master/source/style.css#L120

[20:51] <timotimo> too adorable to make her readjust her lie-down position

[20:51] <timotimo> <!-- Error while syntax highlighting this piece of code: No such symbol 'Text::VimColour' -->

[20:52] <timotimo> well that souds easy to fix

[20:54] <benjikun> Do you think we need to make it somehow use Text::VimColour on examples.perl6.org automatically when adding examples

[20:55] *** epony left
[20:55] <benjikun> Otherwise everyone who adds an example will have to manually highlight their code bits

[20:55] <timotimo> i think the only problem is that it's not yet installed on the machine that builds the website perhaps?

[20:56] <benjikun> hrm

[20:59] <timotimo> oh, i have a suspicion

[20:59] <benjikun> https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/lib/Pod/Htmlify.pm6#L193

[21:00] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/lib/Pod/Htmlify.pm6#L192

[21:00] <timotimo> yes

[21:00] <benjikun> so you were right?

[21:00] <benjikun> Text::VimColour isn't installed

[21:00] <timotimo> it is installed

[21:01] <timotimo> the conditional require mechanics haven't been updated to the change, i think?

[21:01] <timotimo> i.e. lexical require makes Text::VimColour only available inside the curly braces of the try?

[21:02] <benjikun> oh wow

[21:02] <benjikun> oof

[21:02] <timotimo> http://rakudo.org/2017/03/18/lexical-require-upgrade-info/ - that's the post about it

[21:04] <benjikun> seems fairly easy to fix

[21:04] <timotimo> i'm trying it out locally now

[21:04] <timotimo> the docs page uses a different mechanism for syntax highlighting, btw. perhaps that should be ported over, too.

[21:07] <timotimo> hum, not entirely sure why it suddenly complains about LWP::Simple missing right in the middle. it probably EVALs the pod to get the metadata out and that includes "use" statements from the example itself

[21:11] <benjikun> hm

[21:16] <timotimo> the cronjob to update the website ran just 1 minute ago, so we'll have to wait for it to run the next time

[21:29] <timotimo> hum. the update.log file is empty, though?

[21:29] <benjikun> it works!

[21:29] <timotimo> it does?

[21:29] <benjikun> check it out

[21:29] <timotimo> oh, indeed!

[21:29] <timotimo> cool.

[21:30] <benjikun> the background color for the <pre> box could be a bit more complementary but looks good

[21:31] <benjikun> what do you think, timotimo?

[21:31] <benjikun> I think plain white backgrounds for the codeboxes looks nice

[22:35] <Xliff> ^^ When did this happen?

[22:36] <geekosaur> that sounds wrong to me (OpaquePointer := Pointer): Pointer wants to be parameterized, but I'd expect "opaque" to not be

[22:47] *** sftp joined
[22:48] *** HaraldJoerg left
[22:53] <benjikun> How can I clear a hash?

[22:53] <benjikun> without iterating through it

[22:54] <geekosaur> %foo = ()

[22:54] <benjikun> when I do `%h = Nil`, it fails for some reason

[22:54] <benjikun> should Nil not be used there?

[22:54] <geekosaur> it should not

[22:54] <benjikun> hm

[22:55] <benjikun> that worked with arrays, though

[22:55] <geekosaur> it's kinda special, and there are few circumstances when it will do something useful. mostly it exists to mean complete absence, not even "nothing" but "nothing to see here, move along"

[22:55] <jnthn> m: my @a = 1,2,3; @a = Nil; say @a;

[22:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: OUTPUT: ¬´[(Any)]‚ê§¬ª

[22:55] <Xliff> m: say class { has $.x = 42 }.^attributes.say

[22:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: OUTPUT: ¬´(Mu $!x)‚ê§True‚ê§¬ª

[22:55] <geekosaur> so it's kinda like saying "%h = oh wait, I didn;t mean to do anything here at all"

[22:55] <jnthn> Note that Nil doesn't really work for emptying an Array, beyond not giving an error

[22:55] <Xliff> m: say class { has $.x = 42; has $.y = 3.14159 }.^attributes.say

[22:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 64394152c: OUTPUT: ¬´(Mu $!x Mu $!y)‚ê§True‚ê§¬ª

[22:56] <geekosaur> right, it assigned a single default value into it. but for a  hash you need a key and a value, and gave only one (of the wrong type, even)

[22:56] <benjikun> I see

[22:56] <jnthn> `= ()` or `= Empty` will both do it; I tend to use the first because it's less than half the number of chars :)

[22:56] <geekosaur> actually, it might have turned into (Str)

[22:56] <benjikun> didn't realize Empty was a keyword

[22:56] <jnthn> It's not

[22:57] <jnthn> It's a constant

[22:57] <benjikun> oh, does the compiler handle that?

[22:57] <benjikun> ohh

[22:57] <jnthn> Like Nil :)

[22:57] <benjikun> sweet, thanks for the help

[23:30] *** sarna left
[23:48] <benjikun> has anyone here used Template6?

[23:48] <benjikun> not sure how to get the iteration number with the [% for %] loops

[23:51] <benjikun> at least, without using arrays in arrays or something where it would be ((number content) (number content) ...)
