[00:01] <jnthn> El_Che: Yes, I think the disconnect was that I designed precomp as a cache that you should never care about the insides of, and had nowhere near enough idea of how packaging/distribution works to know this might not really fly. Thankfully, folks more clueful on those things are taking care of that area now. :-)

[00:03] <El_Che> \o/

[00:03] <El_Che> jnthn: I think of it as a necessary evil for now, that will disapear once perl6 is faster

[00:03] <jnthn> Oh, we won't ever get rid of precomp, I don't think.

[00:04] <El_Che> or hide it better :)

[00:04] <jnthn> Yes, "hide it" is precisely what I was trying to do. The whole point of the SHA-1s was "you should totally not be poking in here, take a hint" :)

[00:04] <El_Che> as it, show the original module names in errors instead of sha1

[00:04] <jnthn> I thought that already was happening?

[00:05] <El_Che> not on the last stacktrace I saw

[00:05] <jnthn> Hmmm. I thought, sans --ll-exception, they were translated

[00:05] <El_Che> lemme check

[00:05] <jnthn> I may well be wrong on that, but at least my expectation is that they are :)

[00:06] <geekosaur> the original name should be displayed along with the hashed one

[00:06] <MasterDuke> jnthn: thanks, i'll take a look there

[00:06] <jnthn> geekosaur: By default, or by using --ll-exception to ask for it?

[00:06] <geekosaur> by default

[00:06] <jnthn> OK, reasoning?

[00:07] <geekosaur> that I don't know

[00:07] <geekosaur> possibly in case it was something internal/precomp-related going wrong

[00:07] <geekosaur> since it was done while precomp was still a bit troublesome

[00:08] <jnthn> Oh, hang on, are you saying how things are, or arguing how things should be?

[00:08] <kkrev> considering linenoise is apparently problematic and stock readline is broken on many distros I might humbly suggest you get rid of the line perl6 spits out on the console suggesting both of them. rlwrap works pretty well.

[00:08] <El_Che> nope

[00:08] <jnthn> I'd assumed the latter, but perhaps shouldn't have

[00:09] <El_Che> jnthn: i see sha1 paths https://gist.github.com/nxadm/e84b72cc23d5b5e16642796e08ad3dd9

[00:09] <geekosaur> I'm saying what it has been doing ever snce people complained about the hashes back then

[00:09] <jnthn> Ah, OK

[00:10] <geekosaur> El_Che, note the names after the hashes?

[00:10] <geekosaur> that is what was added

[00:10] <El_Che> that's the good part

[00:10] <El_Che> the sha1 is the one that make me grind my teeth

[00:10] <geekosaur> ok, you;re saying the hash should be made not to be at all. suspect you will get argyument there

[00:11] <geekosaur> no I anot going to try to dig up the old discussion that led to this

[00:11] <jnthn> Yeah, I'd somehow thought we only showed the "good part" and you got the hash under --ll-exception

[00:11] <El_Che> geekosaur: that's what I meant by well hidden (an implementation detail)

[00:11] <jnthn> e.g. concise by default, all detail upon request

[00:11] <El_Che> +1

[00:11] *** TreyHarris left
[00:12] <El_Che> I was told the line nr matched, so for debuggin purposes it should be transparent

[00:12] <geekosaur> but note that if you follow that path and look at that line number, you should see thecode in question

[00:13] <geekosaur> so shall everything provide full filesystem mappings so that editors that parse these things work, or is that an unnecessary detail?

[00:13] <geekosaur> it mis not present in a file called Zef::Client

[00:13] <geekosaur> not even in that directory

[00:13] <El_Che> geekosaur: yes, it's usable and useful. But ugly

[00:13] <geekosaur> bnecause you can have multiple versions installed

[00:14] <geekosaur> or potentially a module with the same name but a different authority

[00:14] <El_Che> true

[00:15] <El_Che> about: kkrev's sugestion, if someone is in touch with Linenoise or Readline authors, please ping them

[00:16] <El_Che> as perl6 indeed recommends the modules and they both are broken at least on the latest LTS ubuntu (probably the biggest install base)

[04:51] <ZeonPeon> Is there any perl6 language construct like lisp's "quote"?

[04:54] *** BenGoldberg left
[05:07] <MasterDuke> ZeonPeon: what does that do?

[05:13] <ZeonPeon> Are you familiar with lisp?

[05:16] <ZeonPeon> if so, it transforms lisp code into a list which can be manipulated (and turned back into lisp code with unquote)

[05:16] <geekosaur> I'm familiar, I just don;t see how it fits. A name like $foo is *already* quoted, in that sense; you don't need syntax to prevent a name from being dereferenced.

[05:16] <geekosaur> If what you were looking for was the opposite, that does exist

[05:16] <geekosaur> oh, you mean backquotes.

[05:16] <geekosaur> there's a macro extension, which is not well defined as yet

[05:16] <ZeonPeon> I was looking to capture a function call to be manipulated by an operator

[05:22] <geekosaur> anyway I don't think you can do that as such currently

[05:22] <ZeonPeon> bummer, I guess it's still "early days"

[05:23] <geekosaur> perl 6 is not lisp

[05:23] <ZeonPeon> sadly

[05:24] <araraloren> thinking in Perl 6 :)

[05:24] <ZeonPeon> I guess that's a week ban?

[05:24] <araraloren> what ?

[05:25] <ZeonPeon> off colour jokes?

[05:25] <araraloren>   haha

[05:26] <geekosaur> lisp is somewhat unusual in letting you capture any expression as an AST. I don't think a form as general as lisp's is ever intended. not sure it's even possible as rakudo is implemented; already things like thunking need to be special cases in the grammar, not a general mechanism

[05:28] <ZeonPeon> I like it as a possiblility (not that I would use it effectively often)

[05:28] <geekosaur> I don't much. mostly because I know what it costs to support it ghenerally

[06:49] <Tison> hi guys

[06:50] *** jmerelo joined
[06:51] <Tison> is `knowhow` a perl6 INTERNAL keyword? I've seen it at jnthn's OO::Monitor but it is not  documented.

[06:51] <Tison> anyway, how `knowhow` works

[06:51] <Tison> interesting sentence :-)

[06:52] <Tison> btw, our ecosystem can have modules having same name, right? IIRC we use :auth to distinguish it, but I'm not that sure

[06:52] <araraloren>  they are in different repo, such as github/cpan

[06:54] <jmerelo> Tison: I'll have to check. Anything with HOW is usually part of the metamodel, and this one tends to be implementation-dependent. So it might be Rakudo internal

[06:54] <araraloren> where the knowhow, I am not see it

[06:55] <jmerelo> araraloren: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/search?q=knowHOW&unscoped_q=knowHOW

[06:55] *** damaxi joined
[06:55] <araraloren> I mean in OO::Monitor..

[06:55] <damaxi> Hey :)

[06:55] <araraloren> okay, that's fine

[06:56] <Tison> https://docs.perl6.org/language/mop#Bootstrapping_concerns

[06:56] <Tison> some sentences about `knowhow`

[06:57] <araraloren> so, it said NQP has a ..

[06:57] <araraloren> it's maybe not stable in mean

[06:57] <jmerelo> Tison: yep, but it's NQP. 

[06:58] <Tison> araraloren: seems like I misremembered it :-(

[06:58] <jmerelo> You can apparently use it https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/bafe575799d83256c263d35404acbb3cedc3a4a0/v6/Mildew-Setting-SMOP/t/p6/basic/classhow_add_method.t

[06:58] <araraloren> okay

[06:59] <jmerelo> But that code is old, so who knows. It's probably called something else now.

[07:00] *** Sgeo joined
[07:02] <Tison> ok, back to modules have same name. I know that they are in different repos, but do we distinguish them by `zef install <module>:auth<...>`?

[07:02] <Tison> ..if we use zef to install module

[07:02] <araraloren> yeah, I am not well know it

[07:02] *** Sgeo_ left
[07:03] <jmerelo> Tison: what else could you use? Yep, that's the way to distinguish them.

[07:04] <Tison> thanks :P

[11:36] <Summertime> is there a way to get perl6 to not output unicode versions of quotes around things or whatever?

[11:36] <Summertime> makes debugging a grammar a bit of a pain

[12:17] <El_Che> run a utf8 capable VM :)

[12:31] <jnthn> Tison: knowhow is a mechanism for bootstrapping the object system. It declares a type using the most primitive existing meta-object, and in fact the only one that a Perl 6 runtime needs to provide. It knows how to have attributes and methods and type-match precisely against itself. No inheritance, no role composition, etc. All other OO features are implemented then in NQP or Perl 6 code.

[12:32] <jnthn> Tison: There's very little use for it, unless you decide you'd like to bootstrap an object system from scratch. :-)

[12:34] <jnthn> The main interesting observation is that we don't need to implement things like inheritance, role composition, subset types, enum types, etc. at the level of the VM. Just one very minimal object system that enables writing more interesting meta-objects is enough to base the rest on.

[12:35] <jnthn> As it happens, roles and, to a limited degree, inheritance, are quite nice for factoring a complex meta-model, so NQP's relatively simple object system has meta-objects built on knowhow, and Perl 6 has meta-objects implemented atop of the NQP object system.

[12:40] <moritz> and if your mind isn't bent enough yet, read "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol" by Kiczales et al

[12:40] <moritz> :)

[12:41] <jnthn> My mind's so bent I don't find this stuff mind-bending any more. :P

[14:35] <El_Che> oops

[14:35] <El_Che> we did the same commit

[14:35] <andreoss> araraloren: I used to want JVM backend to run perl6 on Solaris

[14:35] <El_Che> andreoss: jvm is part of the rakudo compiler

[14:36] <El_Che> rakudo has a moarvm and jvm backend (where the moarvm is the more advanced one for now)

[14:36] <El_Che> andreoss: rakudo already runs on Solaris. samcv did the work and tested it recently

[14:36] <El_Che> (it used to fail on libuv in the past)

[14:37] <araraloren> will rakudo have js backend in the future, NQP have a js backend under construction 

[14:38] <andreoss> El_Che: I've already changed the job

[14:38] <moritz> araraloren: rakudo already has a "js" branch

[14:38] <araraloren> oh, so I don't understand, why we need 3 backend ? 

[14:39] *** psychoslave left
[14:39] <moritz> because you cannot rakudo Perl 6 in the browser right now (js)

[14:39] <moritz> moarvm because it's the most versatile one

[14:39] <araraloren> Perl 6 will run on the browser ?

[14:39] <moritz> and jvm because some shops are very experienced with JVM, and are suspicious of everything that's not JVM

[14:40] <El_Che> araraloren: we don't need it. People work on what they find useful. And tha depends on what ecosystem they need to work

[14:40] <andreoss> araraloren: it'd be much easier to sneak perl6 into prduction with JVM backend 

[14:40] <moritz> and with open source projects, the question typically isn't "do we need it?" but "does somebody implement/maintain it?"

[14:41] <araraloren> okay

[14:42] <El_Che> araraloren: if it makes it easier to digest, most efforts seem to be focused on moarvm

[14:42] <El_Che> I certainly can see the value of a js and jvm backend, though

[14:43] <araraloren> I found we build it with node.js, Is node.js is server side language ? or is my mistake

[14:43] <El_Che> it can be used on the client

[14:48] <andreoss> pmd is not very happy about java code rakudo got

[14:49] <andreoss> may be i should try to fix some of it?

[14:49] <jnthn> What's pmd?

[14:51] <andreoss> not actually java's

[14:51] <andreoss> i guess it has rulesets even for perl 

[14:53] <andreoss> no, i'm wrong it has only copy-paste code detection for Perl

[14:55] <Summertime> araraloren, looking to not match though, so, the opposite of $0 I guess?

[14:59] <Summertime> I'll see if I can work a lookahead in

[17:24] <mscha> I think I've got myself a Heisenbug...

[17:25] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { @m[$i]<> X*= 2; }; dd @m; # doesn't work

[17:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «Array @m = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]␤»

[17:25] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { @m[$i]<> X*= 2; say @m[$i]; }; dd @m; # works after adding a .say

[17:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «[2 4 6]␤Array @m = [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]␤[8 10 12]␤[14 16 18]␤»

[17:25] <jmerelo> mscha: when it works after adding a "say" it's a problem with doing stuff in sink context.

[17:26] <mscha> I don't see how the context of the "X*=" is different in both cases...

[17:26] <jmerelo> mscha: probably not sink context. Item context in this case. In the second case, you're reifying @m[$i] when you do "say". In the first case, you're not

[17:27] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { @m[$i]<> X*= 2; 1; }; dd @m;

[17:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of constant integer 1 in sink context (line 1)␤Array @m = [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]␤»

[17:27] <jmerelo> mscha: kinda similar to this https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps#Containers_versus_values_in_a_Capture

[17:28] <mscha> This works as well, so it is indeed a context thing, but I'm not reifying @m now, am I?

[17:29] <geekosaur> mscha, I think what goes on here is that the sink context is that of the 'for'

[17:29] <jmerelo> mscha: you're using @m[$i]<>, decontainerizing and thus not reifying @m[$i]. That is why if you "say", it's reified. If you just did the multiplication without decontainerizing, the multiplication would reify

[17:29] <jmerelo> my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { @m[$i] X*= 2; }; dd @m; 

[17:29] <evalable6> jmerelo, rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «Array @m = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]␤»

[17:31] <jmerelo> it's complicated

[17:31] *** domidumont left
[17:31] <jmerelo> You're decontainerizing to eliminate item context. You should probably use deepmap here

[17:32] <jmerelo> my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; say @m.deepmap( * * 2 )

[17:32] <evalable6> jmerelo, rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «[[2 4 6] [8 10 12] [14 16 18]]␤»

[17:32] <mscha> Without the decont it doesn't work correctly (wrong context)

[17:32] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { @m[$i] X*= 2; 1; }; dd @m;

[17:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of constant integer 1 in sink context (line 1)␤Array @m = [6, 6, 6]␤»

[17:32] *** domidumont joined
[17:32] <jmerelo> my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; say @m.deepmap( * X*= 2 )

[17:32] <evalable6> jmerelo, rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «[[(2) (4) (6)] [(8) (10) (12)] [(14) (16) (18)]]␤»

[17:34] <mscha> In my actual code I'm multiplying (actually dividing) each row with a different number, so deepmap is not an option.  I guess I'll go back to my nested for.  :-(

[17:35] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for ^3 -> $i { my @r := @m[$i]; @r X*= 2; }; dd @m; # even this doesn't work

[17:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «Array @m = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]␤»

[17:35] <jmerelo> mscha: if you need the row number it's going to be complicated no matter what. But think that anythink you can do with for you can do with nested maps, using adverbs. 

[17:35] <jmerelo> mscha: for loops are not p6y, but they do the job.

[17:36] <mscha> I know.  But I want to write p6y code.  ;-)

[17:37] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for @m -> @r { @r X*= 2; }; dd @m; # still no good

[17:40] <mscha> That's pretty close to what I'm actually trying to do.  But I still don't really understand why it doesn't work without the dummy statement.

[17:42] *** kwb joined
[17:43] <geekosaur> I feel like the for is optimizing it away because it ends up in the for's result context where it is discarded, possibly because it's part of a list

[17:43] <geekosaur> we've had bugs like that before

[17:43] *** kwb left
[17:43] <geekosaur> and "features" (Failures don't fire in that case because why loop through a list thats's being discarded?)

[17:43] <mscha> m: my @m = [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]; for @m -> @r { my $div = @r[1]; @r X/= $div; $div = 0 }; dd @m; # works, still a dummy statement, but no warning

[17:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 398c270e4: OUTPUT: «Array @m = [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [0.8, 1.0, 1.2], [0.875, 1.0, 1.125]]␤»

[17:44] <mscha> So this is a bug, right, and worth reporting?

[17:44] *** zakharyas joined
[17:45] <geekosaur> I would say so, although others might differ

[17:46] <geekosaur> the line between "bug" and "normal but unexpected in some cases" is sometimes blurry

[17:50] <jmerelo> mscha: I would say it's a trap. Things get complicated when you involve different contexts (item, sink...)

[17:51] <jmerelo> dummy statement == statement in sink context. There's usually no warning, it just sinks.

[17:51] *** pmurias joined
[17:52] <jmerelo> mscha: it's worth the while to ask in StackOverflow; there will someone very knowledgeable who will explain what's going on. And they someone (or me) will reap the explanation and improve the documentation.
