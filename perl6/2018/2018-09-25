[06:05] <moritz> Hi all

[06:06] <moritz> Apress has asked me to write a book "Perl 6 Quick Syntax Reference"

[06:06] <moritz> currently I'm not really motivated -- is there anybody who wants to write something like that? I could refer you to the Apress folks

[06:07] <jmerelo> moritz: what would be needed to motivate you?

[06:07] <yoleaux> 23 Sep 2018 19:06Z <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: yeah, thanks for poking me. It's going to be an opt-in thingie, so module authors who are interested should set up a hook. I was planning to wait for hacktoberfest news first before setting it up, but there's no info yet. I'll check back tomorrow or in two days or so.

[06:08] <jmerelo> .tell AlexDaniel I would be interested.

[06:08] <yoleaux> jmerelo: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[08:30] <ZzZombo> Offtopic, but did anyone came up with a good way of representing arrays in XML? I right now stick to `<item>value</item><item>value 2</item>` etc without an explicit "container" element.

[08:31] <ZzZombo> I like this because no matter the number of array elements, the underlying code is a simple loop over all `item` elements.

[08:32] *** sotona left
[08:33] <ZzZombo> However, sometimes I feel like it's better to wrap them into another element, but then one item arrays look ugly.

[10:20] <Vijay_> I am a Newbie with perl6 grammar. I find it strange that a string which matches <alpha> does not match <alnum>

[10:21] <Vijay_> isnt <alnum> a superset of <alpha>?

[10:22] <tyil> do you have an example of the string you're trying to match on?

[10:22] *** g029 joined
[10:22] <tyil> (and the grammar you're trying to work with?)

[10:22] *** g029 left
[10:24] <Vijay_> https://pastebin.com/fTWYsS4h

[10:26] <Vijay_> I am basically matching a c++ templated variable defination of the form 'foo<bar> baz, bump;'

[10:27] <masak> Vijay_: would it be possible to golf the example to just the distinction between <alpha> and <alnum>?

[10:28] <masak> (I'm really curious what charaters those are!)

[10:28] <masak> m: say so "a" ~~ /<alpha>/; say so "a" ~~ /<alnum>/

[10:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar b96f60ff7: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[10:29] <masak> clearly "a" ain't it, for example ;)

[10:29] <Vijay_> My understanding is  <alpha> is [a-z_] and <alnum> is [0-9a-z_]

[10:30] <masak> m: say so "б" ~~ /<alpha>/; say so "б" ~~ /<alnum>/

[10:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar b96f60ff7: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[10:30] *** mcmillhj joined
[10:30] <masak> well, that might have been true in olden, pre-Unicode days

[10:30] <masak> the above is a Cyrillic б.

[10:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[10:31] <masak> m: say so "字" ~~ /<alpha>/; say so "字" ~~ /<alnum>/

[10:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar b96f60ff7: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[10:31] <masak> even a Chinese 字 is alphabetic :)

[10:31] <masak> Vijay_: I'm still waiting for your alnum-but-not-alpha character

[10:32] <masak> m: say so "ı" ~~ /<alpha>/; say so "ı" ~~ /<alnum>/  # Turkish ı

[10:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar b96f60ff7: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[10:33] <masak> Vijay_: I think your main problem right now is that you have a big grammar and a hypothesis about what goes wrong in it, but no way to verify/falsify that hypothesis

[10:34] <masak> I'd advise making a copy of the grammar, and then gradually making the copy smaller, until it exposes *only* the thing you find surprising

[10:34] <masak> aka "golfing"

[10:34] *** mcmillhj left
[10:34] <Vijay_> If I change the alpha in the type field to alnum (and delete the variable field) the pattern breaks.... 

[10:35] <Vijay_> Just a minute, I will create a paste with both the examples.

[10:35] <masak> nah, I suggest you do the work yourself and minimize the grammar

[10:36] <masak> I just tried it locally. it prints "Nil" for both <alpha> and <alnum>

[10:37] <masak> so the null hypothesis, that you're confused, can't be rejected at this time ;)

[10:43] *** Zoffix joined
[10:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Zoffix

[10:43] <Vijay_> +masak, the Nil in the paste was because of the variable defination....  In the latest paste the only difference between the two code fragments is alpha and alnum

[10:44] <Zoffix> .tell Xliff both work, and the difference is <before> will just stick an empty capture in the match object. I just went with the one that has fewer characters

[10:44] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to Xliff.

[10:44] *** Zoffix left
[10:45] <masak> Vijay_: reproduced locally.

[10:48] <masak> Vijay_: unrelated, but note that your .* gets grouped with your <ruport> in TOP, so only ruport matches right now

[10:48] <masak> you probably wanted [<port>|<rport>|<ruport>] .*

[10:49] <masak> oh... and if I make that single change, then the alpha/alnum difference goes away

[10:49] <masak> I'm sorry, I'm working now and I don't have time to golf it completely :/

[10:49] <masak> but it does look like a bug to me in the grammar engine

[10:49] <Vijay_> I agree, If I have a single rule in TOP it goes away too. 

[10:50] <Vijay_> Should I report it someplace?

[10:51] <masak> guess this one goes into RT

[10:52] <Vijay_> Is there a separate one for Grammer or should I file it under P6

[10:52] <masak> you can send an email to [email@hidden.address] that will file it as an issue in the perl6 queue

[11:24] <Zoffix> masak: FWIW, it's easier if our GitHub tracker is recommended by default, with the email thing being suggested only if the user doesn't have a GitHub account. RT is a crappy tracker and it's not unheard of emails being blocked/lost, due to all the spam filtering.

[12:45] <Zoffix> El_Che: that link does show comments for me (on desktop). Your link on the other hand, just leads to group page and will show whatever recent post is there

[12:45] <yoleaux> 12:36Z <jnthn> Zoffix: I was originally thinking of doing it by tweaking the call to Promise.start to pass some extra named arg that'd then cause it to set up the handler. About uncaught_handler, that's a property of a Scheduler; thus, we'd respect the scheduler-level handler that was set (if any).

[12:45] <yoleaux> 12:37Z <jnthn> Zoffix: Or alternatively a `start-foo` method (never found a good "foo" word yet; "unsupervised" isn't quite it...)

[12:45] <yoleaux> 12:38Z <jnthn> Zoffix: Anyway, we already look up the scheduler inside of .start so we have it handy in there, plus it's less QAST generation required :)

[12:46] <Zoffix> .tell jnthn feel free to revert my start-in-sink work. It just a fun experiment. I won't shed tears seeing it gone

[13:04] <leont> E.g. sub MAIN(:$foo is getopt("=i@")) { ... }

[13:04] <tadzik> heh, what you're writing reminds me of my GetOpt::Type :P

[13:10] <perlawhirl> Cro::HTTP::Server does not seem to allow access from other machines on the LAN... which is fine... but how do I make it work?

[13:11] <robertle> what do you pass into the "host" arg when building it? localhost?

[13:11] <perlawhirl> yes

[13:11] <perlawhirl> should I use it's lan address instead?

[13:11] <[Coke]> try using a non-local IP addy or hostname.

[13:12] <robertle> Cro inherits something I find counter-intuitive: when you bind a socket, it always binds to an address. so in this case it will resolve "localhost" and then bind to 127.0.0.1 or whatever that is on your machine

[13:12] <[Coke]> otherwise it's probably binding only to that interface.

[13:12] <robertle> you could use "0.0.0.0" instead, or your actual address.

[13:12] <[Coke]> robertle++

[13:12] <robertle> I find that weird because when I create a socket in C an bind it, I can bind to just a port and ignore which interface the traffic is on. for me that is what you typically want

[13:13] <perlawhirl> robertle++ thanks

[13:13] <robertle> is that a libuv thing? or do we do that on purpose? it also has weird effects for ipv4 vs ipv6

[13:14] <lizmat> robertle: perhaps a question for SO or on #cro ?

[13:14] <[Coke]> I'm used to deal with it for other tools.

[13:14] <[Coke]> *dealing

[13:15] <perlawhirl> robertle: i'm fairly un-knowlegable on such things... but it seems to me that in "the old days" most web servers allowed access from the LAN by default, but more lately they have mostly moved to opt-in

[13:15] <perlawhirl> i suspect it's due to security concerns ?

[13:15] <scimon> In my random "I should be working but I'm writing a talk" kind of way I found "is hidden-from-USAGE". Any reason it's not documented (beyond no one's done it). 

[13:15] <robertle> right, but there should be a option to bind to any address. otherwise I have to set up multiple servers to get it to listen on all addresses

[13:16] <leont> robertle: binding is always to an adress and a port

[13:17] <robertle> leont: really? I am sure I have done that...

[13:17] <leont> You probably used INADDR_ANY

[13:18] <robertle> probably! but that is a really useful thing, and I am wondering why there isn't such an option on a perl 6 socket

[13:19] <leont> What do you mean?

[13:20] <leont> The example in the IO::Socket::Async docs does exactly that

[13:21] <leont> Well, the first example, the second binds to localhost. All balanced and stuff :-)

[13:22] <robertle> you mean the '0.0.0.0' being the equivalent of INADDR_ANY? yeah, I now seem to get that to work as well. not sure why I had problems before

[13:22] <robertle> ah, hold on, I know!

[13:23] *** graphene left
[13:23] <jnthn> I think localhost is a sensible default; it's a bit more secure for local testing, the right thing for container deployment, and probably a right thing for putting an nginx/apache proxy in front of it (which is often a good idea).

[13:23] <robertle> because on my machine "localhost" resolves to "::1" rather than "127.0.0.1"

[13:23] <leont> Yeah, in 2018 localhost is probably the better default

[13:24] <robertle> and of course you can't bind to an ipv4 and an ipv6 address at the sane time

[13:24] *** graphene joined
[13:24] <robertle> note that my problem wasn't with the default, but with the (mistaken) impression that you can't get the behavior of INADDR_ANY and always bind to a specific interface

[13:25] *** graphene left
[13:25] <robertle> jnthn: btw, I managed to golf the atomics segfault/weirdness to a much smaller program. doesn't help e with figuring out anything though...

[14:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v vike1

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> hi

[14:08] <jmerelo> I'm going to try and prepare a meetup for hacktoberfest, as well as some "special" issues for people to work on.

[14:08] <jmerelo> Main idea is to have self-contained issues, as in 1. Look up what pod6 is about 2. Check out stuff in perl6intro 3. Check out that.

[14:09] <jmerelo> In hacktoberfest, people flock directly to issues. Letting them face some chosen "easy" issues will probably not get them interested.

[14:09] <jmerelo> I still have the "help with the doc" issue open, and I'll try to close that up before this, for some people who might be acquainted just a bit with the language.

[14:10] *** FranciscoD17 joined
[14:10] <jmerelo> So if y'all see several issues sprung up in the perl6/doc repo, that's the reason.

[14:10] *** mcmillhj joined

[17:27] <TimToady> Xliff: asking about "the <<>> form of enum" is a bit of a sideways-think

[17:27] <TimToady> it's just the list form, and <<>> produces a list

[17:27] <TimToady> anything else that produces a list of pairs or strings would work

[17:27] <TimToady> m: my enum TestE ( A => 0, |<B C D E> ); say TestE.enums;

[18:03] *** Ajr is now known as Guest15977

[18:04] <Guest15977> I dropped in here yesterday with a question about continuing only if a chosen name was already an executable. Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. The code that seems to work is:

[18:04] <Guest15977> exit note "$progname is an existing command\n" if shell "which $progname 2> /dev/null";

[18:05] <Guest15977> though I encountered all sorts of odd results around returns.

[18:06] <Guest15977> Correction, NOT an executable.

[18:10] <AlexDaniel> Guest15977: it may be ok but it looks fragile to me. Generally, variables can be anything, so what's in $progname may get interpreted by the shell in all kinds of funny ways if it's not sanitized properly. If there's a static string there then fine, maybe, but I still don't understand why you need shell there

[18:10] <jmerelo> leont: the thing is that it actually is. Test is part of roast, part of Synopse so it's Perl 6 through and through.

[18:11] <AlexDaniel> i.e. why not `run :!err, 'which', '--', $progname`

[18:11] <leont> I know. I mind have minded less if the thing was well-designed, but it isn't IMNSHO

[18:11] <AlexDaniel> or alternatively `run :!err, <which -->, $progname`

[18:12] *** zxcvz left
[18:13] <Guest15977> I'm aware of the riskd of running unsanitised input, but since I'm the source, it's not that scary.

[18:13] <AlexDaniel> actually it needs :!err and :!out also

[18:13] <AlexDaniel> Guest15977: that doesn't answer the question why you need shell there in the first place

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> if it can be done properly why not do it properly

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> I mean, it's your code and your choices :)

[18:14] <leont> The difficulty in writing extensions (or even customizations) for it is a problem

[18:26] <jmerelo> leont: you lost me there... You mean the issue number?

[18:27] <leont> I meant it's strange to document it as part of the language

[18:27] <leont> I mean, p5 for example has test.pl to test itself against, but that's clearly an internal library which doesn't also try to be a general purpose testing library.

[18:28] <leont> The two have very different use-cases

[19:01] <leont> pmurias: it has some good ideas, but also some things that one would do very different in perl6

[19:01] <leont> dynamic variables feel like a good match for contextual stuff

[19:04] <leont> Test2 essentially does a few things better than Test::Builder. It has objects for events (which allows not only for various transformations, but also sane testing). It has a more usable context idea than "skip X level". And its implementation of subtests doesn't involve localizing all the state.

[20:58] *** graphene joined
[20:58] <lizmat> since you didn't specify any "a" named in the .new, it is Any, and hence the error

[20:59] <lizmat> so I'm not really sure what you're trying to achieve ?

[21:02] <lizmat> https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#index-entry-TWEAK

[21:02] <hythm_> So i m trying to use BUULD to modify this attribute and leave the rest (if paased to .new or not) intact

[23:55] <Success> how come using the character π says 'Decoder may not be used concurrently'

[23:56] <Zoffix> Success: do you have a piece of code that reproduces that?

[23:57] *** bitspill7 left
[23:57] <Success> say 'π'

[23:57] <evalable6> Success, rakudo-moar 5a974cb9e: OUTPUT: «π␤»

[23:57] <Success> hmm... maybe it's windows causing issues or my installation is broken

[23:57] <Zoffix> Success: what's your perl6 version?

[23:58] <Zoffix> Did you run `chcp 65001` in the shell to set utf8 mode?

[23:59] <Zoffix> On 2018.08-108-ga4db33e I get no issues:

[23:59] <Zoffix> C:\rakudo>perl6 -e "say π"

[23:59] <Zoffix> 3.141592653589793

[23:59] <Zoffix> And quoted it gets printed as trash by default and works fine after you run chcp 65001 to set the prompt into utf8 mode
