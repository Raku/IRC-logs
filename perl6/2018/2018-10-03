[01:14] <AlexDaniel> squashable6: next

[01:14] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in 2 days and ‚âà8 hours (2018-10-06 UTC-12‚åÅUTC+14). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[01:14] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: I was just about to ask about hackathon / squashathon

[01:14] <Herby_> :)

[01:15] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: what's the question? :)

[01:15] <Herby_> basically where does one go to get info

[01:17] <AlexDaniel> by default https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day then click on GUIDE

[01:17] <AlexDaniel> currently it points to https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/wiki/SQUASHathon

[01:18] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: if you have a module you should set up a hook, label your issues and help contributors with their PRs

[01:18] <Herby_> great. i don't have any modules, just want looking to contribute towards others. hopefully some easy wins or good beginner issues :)

[01:19] <AlexDaniel> that one depends on others, so I don't know how it's going to go :)

[01:19] <AlexDaniel> meanwhile I'm fixing the guide‚Ä¶ :)

[01:47] <Herby_> sure

[01:47] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: let me know what can be improved, or if there's anything else that's unclear

[01:49] <Herby_> initial feedback: the Frequently Asked Questions bullet doesn't have a hyperlink like the contributers and maintainers do

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> fixed

[07:26] <kensanata> Sometimes error messages are weird. I was struggling with Cro this morning, wanting to set a cookie to 'rainbow unicorn'. The error I got said it expected a CookieValue but had gotten a Str instead. I didn't know what to make of this. It was only by reading the source code that I figured out that this is due to a constraint (because cookie values may not contain spaces etc).

[11:07] <Altreus> What's the difference between Promise(supply {...}) and start { supply { ... } } ?

[11:08] <timotimo> i think the former is equivalent to (supply { ... }).Promise, so it'll tap the supply and resolve the promise when the supply is finished, or maybe when it emits the first value

[11:08] <timotimo> Returns a Promise that will be kept when the Supply is done. If the Supply also emits any values, then the Promise will be kept with the final value. Otherwise, it will be kept with Nil. If the Supply ends with a quit instead of a done, then the Promise will be broken with that exception.

[11:09] <timotimo> that's the description of method Promise on class Supply

[11:19] <Altreus> Say role A has a method frob($x), then role B does role A and wants to add new versions of frob. But role A hasn't declared it multi.

[11:19] <Altreus> This seems odd

[11:20] <Altreus> Because it means that by not declaring a method multi you constrain extension

[11:20] <timotimo> worst case you can add a multi method frob($x) { self::A.frob($x) }

[11:20] <Altreus> But then class C that does B is not allowed to have method frob($x) and also multi method frob()

[11:20] <Altreus> and

[11:20] <Altreus> I tried adding multi method frob($x) but it still complained

[11:21] <Altreus> I'll make a small test

[11:21] <timotimo> OK, in that case you may have to put an empty class in the hierarchy to do that

[11:21] <timotimo> since role composition is kind of like copy-pasting the role's contents into your class

[11:24] <Altreus> Pretend Frobber comes from someone else though

[11:24] <Altreus> Seems strange because it means any code on CPAN is immediately impossible to extend because the methods aren't multi

[11:25] <Altreus> which means why would you ever make a method not multi

[11:25] <lizmat> fwiw, I also think this behaviour of roles wrt to multi / only methods is sub-optimal, almost LTA

[11:25] <Altreus> Does any other language have this sort of default restriction?

[11:25] <Altreus> Every OO language I know of is multi-dispatch by default

[11:26] <Altreus> luckily, in my analogous case, I have control over Frobber

[11:26] <Altreus> I dunno why I'm being secretive about it; all the code is on github anyway

[11:26] <Altreus> I fear judgement ;)

[11:27] <lizmat> I think you're a bit paranoid  :-)

[11:33] <masak> re "why would you ever make a method not multi" -- designing for *lack of* extensibility is a valid use case/tradeoff in many cases, IMHO

[11:33] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v leont

[11:33] <masak> whether `only` is a good default for methods is another matter

[11:33] <masak> (but it is consistent with how subs work, and macros)

[11:34] <leont> I can see the advantage for subs but not for methods (in the general case)

[11:35] <leont> Then again, global subs are something to avoid anyway, and properly namespaces it isn't really an issue

[11:36] <pmurias> timotimo: I can't tell if it's a thought out decision or just a literal interpretation of S29

[11:36] <masak> not sure where "global" comes into it, or whether I agree there's something wrong with global subs for (say) small scripting uses

[11:36] <pmurias> Zoffix: do we really want use the value of --encoding for EVAL on Blob?

[11:38] <pmurias> masak: almost everything is okish for small scripting uses ;)

[11:39] *** pmurias left
[11:39] <masak> yes, well, "properly namespaced it isn't really an issue" -- when you start scaling up to modules, each "global" is really only a private module namespace

[11:54] <tadzik> masak: in case of objects it feels like a bit of an open-closed violation imho

[11:59] <masak> no, I think it goes deeper than that

[12:00] <masak> quoting Bloch, "Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it" (Item 19 in Effective Java)

[12:01] <masak> I think that's an extreme stance (measured relative to what most people think), but I think it makes sense from an API perspective

[12:01] <masak> crucially, some classes one writes *should not be extended*

[12:01] <lizmat> afk for a few hours&

[12:02] <leont> TBH, most classes I write shouldn't be extended

[12:02] <masak> right

[12:03] <masak> inheritance is not a universal right -- it's more like a fairly limited design choice

[12:03] <masak> from that perspective, I think it makes sense for methods to be `only` by default, actually

[12:04] <masak> it's only in recent OO languages that methods are *virtual* by default ;)

[12:04] *** domidumont joined
[12:05] <pmurias> masak: do you think methods being *not* virtual makes any sense from a language design perspective

[12:25] <masak> I've had real-world bugs come from virtual/overridden methods being called from a constructor in Java

[12:25] <masak> the order in which initializers/constructors in base/derived classes run in Java is very surprising

[12:26] <masak> pmurias: I dunno. I haven't really taken a stance on that issue. from what I've read there's kind of a final-by-default camp and a virtual-by-default camp

[12:27] <masak> and they both have reasonable arguments

[18:05] <kensanata> I'm looking for some Perl6 and Cro advice for this route: https://github.com/kensanata/oddmuse6/blob/master/Oddmuse/lib/Oddmuse/Routes.pm6#L65 -- it's a simple CAPTCHA sort of thing: if you don't have the secret cookie, go answer a question; if you have the answer, go set the cookie. The first problem I have is I don't know how to move this code into a sub.

[18:06] <kensanata> set-cookie only seems to work in this particular context and I don't know what to pass to a sub so that I can call set-cookie over there. Something about the invisible request, I assume.

[18:07] <kensanata> I was also wondering how to write this using the Auth idea that Cro comes with but wasn't sure how to do it, exactly, since I don't actually have accounts so translating the examples wasn't straight forward.

[18:07] <sena_kun> kensanata, give me a second...

[18:09] <sena_kun> kensanata, so you did try to just move your code into the sub and call it from route? The thing is it works using dynamic variable, so I am tend to think it should just work here.

[18:10] *** puddingpimpvP left
[18:12] <kensanata> sena_kun: Let me recreate what I had and get back to you with an error. :)

[18:32] <mantovani> do you recommend some article to learn perl 6 grammar ? the example of the documentation is quick simple

[18:32] <El_Che> mantovani: http://theperlfisher.blogspot.com/2016/02/from-regular-expressions-to-grammars-pt.html

[18:32] <El_Che> there are 4 pieces

[18:33] <mantovani> thank you El_Che.

[18:33] <El_Che> The author is a regular here :)

[18:33] <mantovani> great :)

[18:33] <moritz> mantovani: I'd recommend https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/ but I'm biased :-)

[18:34] <El_Che> also, moritz published a book on the subject

[18:34] <El_Che> ah, his spam was faster than my reaction :P

[18:34] <mantovani> thank you moritz

[18:35] <mantovani> moritz: when I read a book from safaribooking they pay you?

[18:36] <moritz> mantovani: there is a one-time payment to me for inclusion in safari books, but not per read there

[18:36] <moritz> but that's fine. If I were after the money, I'd spent my time differently than writing Perl 6 books :-)

[18:37] <El_Che> moritz: interesting to know

[18:37] <El_Che> I thought it was an streaming model

[18:37] <moritz> might depend on the publisher

[18:38] <moritz> anyway, I'd be much happier about an amazon rating (doesn't need to be a full review) than another paying customer

[18:39] <tison> oh I forget to give a rating, your book is the first recommendation when someone asked me if there is a Perl 6 book.

[18:40] <El_Che> moritz before (the beginning) the amazon review and after (from sec 40): https://twitter.com/ThatEricAlper/status/1047286804645199872

[18:45] <El_Che> mantovani: do you have "Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars" in Safari? I don't and I wonder if it's a region thing

[18:46] <El_Che> (think perl6 is there)

[18:46] <El_Che> (also Perl6 Deep Dive)

[18:46] <mantovani> El_Che: what do you mean ?

[18:46] <moritz> right, Apress sells watermarked but DRM-Free PDFs

[18:46] <mantovani> Safari the browser?

[18:47] <El_Che> no o'reilly service

[18:47] <geekosaur> oreillys online thing

[18:47] <El_Che> learning perl6 also arrived

[18:47] <El_Che> so we have 3 recent books there

[18:47] <El_Che> and 3 old ones

[18:47] <mantovani> moritz: I just bought the book 

[18:48] <moritz> mantovani: thanks

[18:48] <El_Che> (2 old instead of 3: 2003, 2004)

[18:48] <El_Che> It may be interesting to read to see what's changed

[18:49] <El_Che> DrForr's series of talks is also there

[18:49] <Garland_g[m]> moritz: Thanks for writing that book. I got myself a copy and it's really helped me understand Grammars better.

[19:13] <masak> m: say ((63 - 58) / 63 * 100).fmt("a %.1f%% speedup")

[19:15] <tbrowder__> i‚Äôm still looking for a new best editor. has anyone ever used Sublime Text or UltraEdit or Komodo?  if so, can they be modified, by the user, to work with p6?  same questions for Slick Edit.

[19:15] <ufobat> funny, the stack trace looks differently when i clone cro and do a perl6 -I ../to/cloned/cro/lib

[19:15] <tbrowder__> thanks

[19:17] <tadzik> 7.9% is pretty fat :)

[19:17] <mantovani> DrForr: your blog is not being indexed by Google

[19:17] <tbrowder__> i have a love-hate relationship with emacs, hate the lisp stuff, but love the results (sometimes).

[19:20] <sena_kun> tbrowder__, vim maybe? I am an emacs user though(well, moving to Comma for testing purposes). Is there something particular you don't like in just using emacs's perl6-mode(without a couple of bugs) or just general lack of features?

[19:21] <Zoffix> .tell pmurias I imagined --encoding was for source code encoding, hence why it makes sense in blob evals

[19:21] <tbrowder__> sena_kun: hi!

[19:22] <sena_kun> o/

[19:22] <ufobat> i see the bug, i dont know how to fix it :(

[19:23] <sena_kun> ufobat, can you please post your guesses to https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/68 (if it's relevant)? Otherwise, https://github.com/croservices/cro/issues/65

[19:24] <ufobat> ty for the links

[19:24] <jnthn> tbrowder__: Also, please remember to submit details about things you run into (beyond those you already have, of course). I'm using it for nearly all my Perl 6 coding by now, to also uncover stuff (and also because by now I miss the auto-complete and error detection too much everywhere else... :))

[19:25] <sena_kun> I remember the same bug was reproducible after N times of running just plain YAML loading, so we suspected it's concurrency issue with YAMLish. But now iirc we have a guard there and the bug is still here it seems.

[19:25] <tbrowder__> well, for emacs, i would really like a good unicode visual map, get perl5 mode working, and get horizontal sliders working. since i moved from xemacs to emacs with p6, i‚Äôve not been real happy (although i‚Äôm very pleased with my p6 sub/class/var indexer contribution).

[19:25] <ufobat> then maybe i run into a different bug, sena_kun 

[19:25] <jnthn> Yeah, I remember putting in some kind of locking around the YAML loading...did that get released yet, though?

[19:26] <ufobat> sena_kun, give me a sec, i'll create a gist to let to know what i have spotted. maybe i am wrong

[19:26] <sena_kun> ufobat, then please report it, it'd be very appreciated.

[19:26] * jnthn really wants to get 0.8.0 out late this week or early next week; probably, looking at my schedule, the latter.

[19:27] *** steamport joined
[19:27] <sena_kun> tbrowder__, oh, you have more needs than just "type text with some highlighting and indentation" it seems. then I am afraid I am not much of help.

[19:27] <masak> does anyone want to hear something freaky I just realized about unquotes?

[19:27] * masak .oO( don't ask to horrify )

[19:28] <tbrowder__> jnthn: to be fair i‚Äôve not used commaide much. the lack of a visual tool for unicode is a feature i really want, and it‚Äôs been a little slow on my laptop‚Äîi‚Äôm probably not a typical user, ‚Äòcause i don‚Äôt use many power features.

[19:31] *** steamport left
[19:31] <jnthn> tbrowder__: What visual tools for Unicode are you using otherwise, out of curiosity?

[19:31] <sena_kun> ufobat, thanks! bookmarked it.

[19:32] <ufobat> i dont know if it is the same bug, but if you tell me if it fits to one of those 2 issues i'll comment on it. i just started cro, i have no clue what the cro-file is in a service

[19:33] <sena_kun> ufobat, seems to be something different at a glance.

[19:33] <jnthn> ufobat: https://cro.services/docs/cro-yml fwiw 

[19:33] <tbrowder__> jnthn: i‚Äôm just using the klingon mind meld with emacs to insert codepoints, and i use \x and \c a fair amount when needed inside rakudo source

[19:34] <masak> "vulcan mind meld", surely?

[19:34] <masak> or is the Klingon mind meld a really aggressive version of that?

[19:34] <tbrowder__> yeah, that, couldn‚Äôt think of vulcan soon enough

[19:34] <tbrowder__> i did mean vulcan

[19:35] <ufobat> i do have such a .cro.yml file

[19:35] <geekosaur> masak, were you looking to be unquoted?

[19:35] <geekosaur> :p

[19:35] <masak> geekosaur: I'll take that as a "yes" :P

[19:36] <masak> ok, so you all know that when you compare two operators A and B for precedence, there are three possible answers

[19:36] <masak> "A is tighter", "B is tighter", "A and B share a precedence level"

[19:37] <masak> these are the *only* three possible answers on a totally ordered set

[19:37] <masak> for a *partially* ordered set, there's a fourth answer

[19:38] <masak> "A and B are do not have a comparable precedence"

[19:38] <masak> but that answer is not possible, since the precedence levels are totally ordered...

[19:38] <masak> ...*until* you introduce quasi unquotes o.O

[19:40] <jnthn> Well, that's an interesting point to poset... :P

[19:41] *** pyrimidine left
[19:41] <jnthn> This effectively means that you can't actually put a quasi's quoted material into tree form until the unqoutes are filled?

[19:41] <masak> correct

[19:41] <jnthn> Or at least, not a final tree form...

[19:42] <jnthn> That's kinda evil :)

[19:42] <masak> I realized this time last year that you shouldn't even try to put it in tree form before evaluation

[19:42] <masak> the JS templating libraries that implement templates as functions got it right

[19:43] <jnthn> Especially given that Perl 6 actually tries to do this while parsing EXPR, not even in an actions phase later (every compiler I've written in Perl 6 actually defers it to actions, though :))

[19:43] <jnthn> So that implies maybe we need a different EXPR (and who knows what else) for parsing quasis

[19:44] <masak> yeah, there's certainly a tension going on there

[19:44] <masak> a... different EXPR. but that'd be *gasp* two code paths!

[19:44] <jnthn> Oh no!!!

[19:44] * masak .oO( meanwhile, in the other code path: Oh no!! )

[19:45] * jnthn goes to cry, though mainly 'cus he has to chop onions :)

[19:57] *** pyrimidine joined
[19:58] <kensanata> When I'm on my Debian server, I am offered perl6 and rakudo, but on this laptop I installed rakudo-star, if I remember correctly. How do I decide what I need?

[19:58] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pyrimidine

[19:58] <El_Che> She is a miniter in the Taiwanese government nowadays

[20:01] <moritz> kensanata: look at the version numbers available for either

[20:01] <moritz> also, "apt-cache show $package" can provide some insight

[20:02] <moritz> for example on ubuntu, the info for perl6 contains

[20:02] <moritz>  perl6 package is a meta package that aims to depend on a Perl6

[20:02] <moritz>  compiler and Perl6 core modules. Currently this package depends only

[20:02] <moritz>  on a compiler (rakudo). Dependency on the perl6 modules shipped by rakudo-star

[20:02] <moritz>  will be added later once they are available on Debian.

[20:02] <kensanata> moritz: One says 6.c-1, the other 2016.12-1 and my own is 2018.06 but is apparently also 6.c

[20:02] <kensanata> Ah.

[20:04] <El_Che> on my ubuntu: 2018.03-1 (what's packaged on Ubuntu 18.04) and 2018.09-01 (my rakudo-pkg debian/ubuntu repo)

[20:04] <El_Che> I guess star is something in between

[20:05] <jnthn> 6.c is the language version, 2018.06 is the compiler version; 2018.06 will be an enormous amount better. :)

[20:06] <kensanata> OK!
