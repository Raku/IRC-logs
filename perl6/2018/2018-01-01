[00:26] <Herby_> I'm teaching myself a little bit about SQL and am stumped on an example

[00:26] <Herby_> I have a table with two columns:  FilmName, FilmProfit

[00:27] <Herby_> I'd like to return a count of films with FilmProfit > 500000000, and count of < 500000000

[00:27] <Ven``> happy new year :)

[00:27] <Herby_> I'd like to start using actual databases for my programs instead of text files

[00:28] <Herby_> Ven``: you too!

[01:00] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: fwiw sql and database management systems are cool, but for simple programs using files is just fine

[01:00] <timotimo> IMO, sqlite is a nice replacement for "just use a text file"

[01:01] <timotimo> (i have heard often "sqlite is not a replacement for mysql/postgresql/mssql, but a replacement for fopen". i like that sentiment)

[06:29] <Zoffix> Looks like throws-like() is warty too. While it checks for throwage, it does so while enabling `use fatal` and probably sinking result too, so deliberly explodes Failures that the user of the routine might wish to not have

[16:07] <comborico1611_> I see it in Docs.  The search will not show cross operator, but it will meta operator

[16:07] <stmuk> Perl6: it might be easier to install Rakudo Star 2017.10 anyway and take note of the paths displayed at the last step of the install

[16:07] <comborico1611_> I forgot how to submit a complaint.

[16:08] <Perl6> stmuk: Yeah, probably :P Thanks for your help

[16:08] <comborico1611_> I too had trouble installing Rakudo Perl 6.  Eventually, I just typed in "perl6" into Bash.

[16:08] <comborico1611_> Then the prompt said to install this type "blah blah blah".

[16:09] <comborico1611_> Blah blah blah = sudo apt install rakudo 

[16:09] <comborico1611_> Something like that.

[16:10] <comborico1611_> The official installation instructions were not good.

[16:11] <comborico1611_> Herby_: Nope.  It's not Infix Cross Operator.

[16:11] <comborico1611_> I tried a capital x in the code, and it threw an error.

[16:12] <Herby_> then I'll have to defer to one of the brighter minds lounging around here :)

[16:12] <gfldex> m: say "many" x 10;

[16:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 333efa0b6: OUTPUT: ¬´manymanymanymanymanymanymanymanymanymany‚ê§¬ª

[16:12] <gfldex> this ^^^ one?

[16:12] <comborico1611_> Ahh

[16:12] <Herby_> m: say "Happy New Year" x 3

[16:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 333efa0b6: OUTPUT: ¬´Happy New YearHappy New YearHappy New Year‚ê§¬ª

[16:13] <comborico1611_> No problems, Herb.  Thanks for the help!

[16:13] <comborico1611_> A clue!

[16:13] <comborico1611_> Yeah, it's that.

[16:13] <comborico1611_> Now, what is its name?  Haha. 

[16:14] <comborico1611_> And, what does infix mean?

[16:14] <comborico1611_> Dictionary and Docs didn't help.

[16:14] <Herby_> infix operator: characterized by the placement of operators between operands

[16:15] <Herby_> essentially the operator is in the middle

[16:15] <Herby_> 2 + 3

[16:15] <Herby_> 5 * 8

[16:15] <Herby_> "hello" x 5

[16:16] <Herby_> versus postfix:  $number++

[16:16] <Herby_> versus prefix: ++$number

[16:17] <comborico1611_> Thanks!

[16:17] <comborico1611_> Strange that the normal setup of operator and operands needs a name.

[16:18] <comborico1611_> So the categories again are infix, postfix, and prefix, right?

[16:18] <Herby_> https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators

[16:18] <comborico1611_> Thanks!

[16:18] <Herby_> take a peek there. looks like there are quite a bit of categories that i've never heard of

[16:20] *** domidumont left

[16:25] <Herby_> :)

[16:25] <Perl6> wow

[16:25] <comborico1611_> No offense, dear perl6ers, but I think this is how perl gets a reputation for unreadable.  

[16:25] *** geospeck joined
[16:26] <gfldex> any language you don't know is unreadable

[16:26] <comborico1611_> There are so many operators that one can be good with perl6, but still not understand some things because of the copious operators.

[16:26] <comborico1611_> Yes, I get that.

[16:27] <timotimo> there are more operators compared to, for example, python, but one operator only means ~one thing in perl6 whereas it can mean ~many things in, for example, python

[16:27] <comborico1611_> I'm just giving an honest opinion of what seems to be obvious to me.  But I don't know any programming language well, but I am familiar with 3 others, and this one by-far has the most operators.

[16:28] <timotimo> yeah, perl is definitely operator-rich

[16:28] <comborico1611_> But you know, I get these feeling Larry Wall really knows what he is doing.  And that's why I'm here.

[16:28] <gfldex> operators are easy to search for. If you got a method call on an object, you first need to find the type of that object, before you can even start to look the method up.

[16:28] <comborico1611_> these=this

[16:28] <timotimo> but we tend to think putting the information of what an operator does into the operator rather than the types you pass it is a good idea

[16:29] <Herby_> Is there a Perl 6 style/formatting guide floating around somewhere? I find that would help newcomers/beginners manage better

[16:29] <Herby_> i include myself in that crowd

[16:33] <comborico1611_> What does this mean at the top of a program? use v6;

[16:33] <gfldex> Herby_: we don't got any that I know of. You may want to read code by jnthn if you want to see beauty.

[16:33] <comborico1611_> I took it out, and it didnt' crash the program.

[16:34] <gfldex> comborico1611_: it's a hint to the compiler. A perl5 compiler should complain.

[16:34] <Herby_> gfldex: thanks

[16:34] <comborico1611_> gfldex, oh yeah?  I'll need to look at that.  Thank!

[16:34] <comborico1611_> Thanks!

[16:34] <gfldex> in the future we can use that to tell the compiler it should compile for an older verion of perl6

[21:26] <Juerd> Or to be honest, probably (%ENV<PATH> // $default-path).IO

[21:26] <Juerd> But that kinda depends on the rest of the code

[21:26] <Zoffix> El_Che: I see some failures on travis on Linux, but I think it's still reverberations from New Years glitch  and none of the failures are in the test file you're mentioning: https://travis-ci.org/rakudo/rakudo/jobs/323768096#L1480

[21:28] <timotimo> yeah, the other half of the thing was actually $other-thing.add("blah"), so it was already an IO

[21:28] <timotimo> an extra .IO is of course a no-op on that, but i still wanted it separate

[21:32] <Zoffix> sudo apt-get time;  # unless you don't want to install it; in which case, does that code say "True" or does it fail?

[21:39] <Zoffix> It should bail out ^ like that right away

[21:39] <El_Che> it did now

[21:40] <El_Che> took 20 sec or something like that

[21:40] <El_Che> identic error

[21:41] <Zoffix> why does it take 20sec tho :S

[21:41] <El_Che> first test with correct perl6: https://gist.github.com/nxadm/52e8e320a92fe86b939c652f12c06195

[21:42] <El_Che> machine has 16gb of ram, mostly not used

[21:42] <El_Che> i7

[21:42] <El_Che> ssd

[21:42] <El_Che> seems fast enough

[21:42] <Zoffix> El_Che: what distro are you using there? I'm gonna fire it up in VM to see if I can repro this

[21:42] <El_Che> ubuntu 17.10 amd64

[21:43] <El_Che> but the point is, is that it fails on ALL distros

[21:43] <El_Che> (see my travis link)

[21:43] <El_Che> make it 40 sec

[21:43] <El_Che> real0m39,520s

[21:44] <Zoffix> El_Che: ok, then lets try something else first. How do you build your rakudos? Perhaps our build steps differ

[21:46] <Zoffix> $ cd $(mktemp -d); echo -e '#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void) { printf("%lld\\n", 0xFFFFFFFFLL); return 1; }' | gcc -x c -; ./a.out 

[21:47] <Zoffix> 4294967295

[21:47] <Zoffix> Do you get the same number?

[21:51] <geekosaur> o.O

[21:52] <Zoffix> lol

[21:52] <Zoffix> What's wrong? :)

[21:53] <geekosaur> that result is correct for (long) and (int). (long long) should be larger unless printf() is broken

[21:53] <geekosaur> wait, I am misreading, sorry

[21:53] <Zoffix> *phew* :)

[21:54] <geekosaur> LL suffix should prevent extension of that constant

[21:54] <geekosaur> although C has some problems even in the standard around that

[21:55] <geekosaur> and, well, printf. even with ll flag (this gets into why the problems extend even into the standard)

[22:06] <gfldex> lizmat: a surprisingly sober weekly :)

[22:07] <lizmat> well, I did have a lot to drink last night and got only out of bed around 3:30pm, almost immediately catching up to work on the P6W

[22:08] <lizmat> so...  sober?  more a bit hangovvery  :-)

[22:10] <Zoffix> lizmat++ # good weekly. The Yearly Stats blew my mind

[22:11] <lizmat> hehe...  mischief achieved :-)

[22:11] *** pecastro joined
[22:12] <Zoffix> for pushing weeklys as info alerts: it's up to you really. If you give me some stable host for your IRC, I can add you to the p6lert bot so you could publish

[22:12] *** espadrine joined
[22:14] <lizmat> well, the P6W is not really core now, is it ?

[22:15] <lizmat> that would be my reason not to push it as an alert

[22:15] <Zoffix> OK :)
