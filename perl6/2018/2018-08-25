[11:49] <tbrowder_> tyil: hi! i enjoyed your notes on glasgow. were you offended by anything?

[11:50] <tyil> there were things I disagreed with, surely, but those notes were part of the redacted area :p

[11:51] <tbrowder_> i have finished my observations and proposals for p6 pod on the rakudo wiki. comments are welcome.

[11:51] <tyil> link?

[11:52] <tbrowder_> um, go to the github rakudo repo and see the wiki tab

[11:52] <tyil> I just finished rewriting assixt documentation in pod 6

[11:52] <tyil> gonna re-read it all, merge it, take a glass of whisky and then I can probably read through it all

[11:53] <tbrowder_> is that irish, tennessee, or scotch whiskey?

[11:54] <tyil> scotch

[11:54] <tyil> Arran single malt scotch whiskey, aged 10 years

[12:00] <tbrowder_> ah, good sipping stuff

[12:01] <tyil> I had a taste of it in Glasgow, but it was cheaper to buy it online in NL than to buy it there in the store :p

[12:01] <tyil> and it was delivered this morning

[12:48] <tyil> \o/

[12:49] <tbrowder_> which will be a nativecall wrapper around either brlcad or pango, but don’t place any bets yet!

[12:50] <tyil> I had already pulled up my credit card :(

[12:50] <tyil> als, on your proposal, I personally have had no problems dealing with mixed content in a Para's @.contents

[12:53] *** sotona joined
[12:53] <tbrowder_> i know, but for me, visualizing, walking, and manipulating the doc tree is harder

[12:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sotona

[12:54] <tyil> I'm using multi-methods extensively to make it easy (for me) to deal with

[12:54] <tbrowder_> writing $obj.contents[0],contents[0].contents[0] is not fun

[12:54] <tyil> https://gitlab.com/tyil/perl6-pod-to-pager/blob/master/lib/Pod/To/Pager.pm6 as an example

[12:54] <tbrowder_> nor intuitive

[12:54] <stmuk_> Macallan 12 Year!

[12:55] <tyil> I just pass on the contents to another render() which will loop through the contents array and call render() on each element

[12:55] <tyil> and the multi methods will resolve to the correct render() method based on the content

[12:57] <tyil> I was working on a role to extract that idea and implement it as an interface that can be used easily by others as well

[12:57] <tyil> hopefully making it easier to work with pod formatters

[12:57] <tbrowder_> cool, i will try that module, too

[12:57] *** sotona left
[12:58] <tyil> it is far from finished, sadly, but feel free to try whether it works Good Enough for you :p

[12:58] <tyil> I'l make Pod::To::Man with that role, if I find the time and interest

[12:58] <tyil> and some documentation would probably be nice to have

[12:59] <tyil> do you have a preferred time in which you would like to start using it?

[12:59] <tyil> I can try to shift some priorities to spend more time on Pod::To::Anything for a while

[13:00] <tbrowder_> i see you moved to gitlab early this year, glad you moved?

[13:00] <tyil> yes

[13:00] <tbrowder_> um, don’t make any plans based on my erratic plans :)

[13:00] <tyil> I've found it to be a much better platform than github so far

[13:00] <tyil> especially with regards to automated testing

[13:01] <tyil> as defined here https://gitlab.com/tyil/perl6-pod-to-anything/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml, I can just use rakudo-star docker images as a base

[13:01] <tyil> so I don't have to deal with ssetting up a Perl 6 bin repo, or compile it

[13:02] <tbrowder_> ah, did i read somewhere it’s faster because rakudo doesn’t have to be recompiled each test?

[13:02] <tyil> it also builds a distribution after succesfully testing the master branch

[13:02] <tyil> yes, it's much faster than compiling

[13:03] <tbrowder_> ok, i’ll check it out, thnx

[13:24] <tyil> I'm sure on the jamesons, might have done tilamore as well

[13:24] <tyil> most of my whisky experiences come from the perl mongers

[13:24] <tyil> they're a bad influence on my drinking habits

[13:40] <tyil> hi

[13:42] *** sacomo left
[13:44] <Vlasis> new to Perl 6 here, I'm considering a move from Perl 5 because I read that there is a compiler available

[13:44] <Vlasis> is this already available in Rakudo?

[13:44] <tyil> cool!

[13:45] <tyil> if I'm not mistaken (I'm not a core dev, so take my words with a grain of salt), Rakudo *is* the compiler

[13:46] <Vlasis> so we could then distribute an executable instead of a script file with the source code in visible format? the reason why we are considering the shift of our code to Perl 6 is to protect it

[13:47] <tyil> ah, like that

[13:47] <Vlasis> this is good to hear!

[13:47] <Vlasis> thanks!

[13:47] <tyil> I'm not sure if that's a possibility yet, but someone with more knowledge might have better answers

[13:47] <Vlasis> thank you!

[13:47] <timotimo> there's a perl6 module that generates an installable msi which bundles a full rakudo with your application code

[13:48] <timotimo> the "best" way we currently have to distribute a perl6 program as "a single thing" is perhaps a docker container. there's been a prototype for creating appimages, too.

[13:48] <timotimo> maybe at some point someone could try building tooling to build flatpaks out of perl6 programs

[13:49] <Vlasis> and if Rakudo is already installed I suppose that I could distribute a file format that is not a script, something like bytecodes that do not show the source code? Is this already possible?

[13:49] <timotimo> but rakudo is not a compiler that outputs a .exe or executable machine code, at least not with any of the backends we currently have

[13:49] <timotimo> though the java backend perhaps comes close? i haven't tried building a single .jar file from rakudo and a program

[13:50] *** sacomo joined
[13:50] <Vlasis> using a backend would not be problem for us, as long as we could distribute a file that does not show the source code in plain sight

[13:50] <timotimo> you could distribute bytecode, but it would depend on your users having the exact same compilation results of rakudo's innards as well

[13:51] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sacomo

[13:51] <timotimo> by backend i mean that rakudo can run on the jvm, moarvm, javascript almost fully, and truffle a little bit

[13:53] <Vlasis> @timotimo: so, if a user has Rakudo+one of the backends (for eg. MoarVM) then I could give them a bytecodes file suitable for the backend and they would be able to execute it?

[13:54] <timotimo> i don't know for sure

[13:54] <timotimo> but i hope you realize the bytecode is not too hard to understand

[13:55] <Vlasis> @timotimo: yes, but at least it is not just plain code... :(

[14:01] <timotimo> in order to actually run bytecode, you will have to run "perl6 -I folder-with-the-precomp-stuff-available -MNameOfEntryModule -e ''"

[14:02] <timotimo> i.e. tell it to run an empty program

[14:02] <timotimo> or have a tiny script that loads the module

[14:03] *** Ven` left
[14:09] <Vlasis> @timotimo: thanks, I will give it a try

[14:10] <timotimo> you may want to research CompUnit::Repository::Staging which is meant to handle precompilation before distribution if i'm not mistaken

[14:13] <Vlasis> @timotimo: many many thanks

[14:14] <timotimo> i hope it'll work :S

[14:14] <timotimo> it'd be great if you could give us a little write-up of your experience, regardless of success or failure

[14:18] <Vlasis> @timotimo: sure! :)

[21:51] <jnthn> If your plan is "don't break back-compat for rather little" and "don't break back-compat for rather a lot", then that boils down to "don't break back-compat at all"? :)

[22:08] <tyil> its a good intention to never break backwards compat

[22:09] <tyil> but it's *very* rare to never have this lingering feeling of "maybe, we couldve done this better" when looking at older code

[22:13] <tyil> it feels mostly like the 2 in Go 2 is supposed to lack any significance, from what I gather from the slides
