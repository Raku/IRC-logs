[01:29] <colomon> p6: say “5134”.substr(0, */2)

[01:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 404f30217: OUTPUT: «This type cannot unbox to a native integer: P6opaque, Rat␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:29] <colomon> p6: say “5134”.substr(0, * div 2)

[01:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 404f30217: OUTPUT: «51␤»

[01:34] <colomon> documentation ( https://docs.perl6.org/routine/substr ) seems off, plus requiring an Int instead of a Rat seems needlessly picky

[01:45] <MasterDuke> colomon: have you created an issue for that?

[01:45] <colomon> nope

[01:45] *** entonian joined
[01:45] <colomon> was trying to get actual work done in p6 :)

[01:46] <colomon> doc issue is obvious… dunno if allowing Rats makes sense or not

[01:47] <colomon> is https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues the right place to report doc issues?

[01:47] <MasterDuke> fwiw, i just tried adding a .Int to where it blows up and that makes it work

[01:47] <MasterDuke> yeah

[01:48] <MasterDuke> i'll create a rakudo issue for discussion

[01:53] <MasterDuke> ok, still want me to create an issue?

[02:05] <Zoffix> Thanks.

[02:05] <colomon> p6: my $s = “5134”.chars; say “5134”.substr(0, $s/2)

[02:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 404f30217: OUTPUT: «51␤»

[02:06] <colomon> So I figure the same thing done with Callable definitely should work

[02:06] <Zoffix> (it's gonna take me ~30-60m, 'cause Range also has this problem and substr-rw and substr-eq don't take the same args yet they should)

[02:06] *** ufobat_ left
[02:07] <colomon> no worries from me!  thanks for taking the time to do it properly.

[06:14] <yoleaux> 8 Apr 2018 18:46Z <Zoffix> jmerelo: FWIW, the discouragement against rakudobrew isn't just first time users. It introduces a bug with USAGE. It is known to introduce precomp bugs. It builds random dev commit instead of a release. It requires running a command after installing any binary. And it requires reinstalling modules after each update, which isn't needed anymore for rakudo.

[15:24] <Zoffix> it's possible the search is broken because there's no longer html/js dir where it's meant to write stuff into

[15:25] <Zoffix> (the dir is still there on the build server)

[15:29] <jmerelo> The problem with search is different, I think.

[15:35] <Zoffix> No

[15:35] <Zoffix> I saw that one during last update on build server, but merely upgrading rakudo + all modules fixed that.

[15:35] *** pharv left
[15:35] *** zakharyas left
[15:36] <Zoffix> But the MAST::Frame stuff that's the guts from QAST->MAST compiler and end users should never see it, really. So there's some bug that makes the guts spil out

[15:37] <Zoffix> (presumably fixed on latest rakudo)

[15:38] <jmerelo> Zoffix: I haven't been able to reproduce that with 2018.03, actually. Can downgrade to 2018.01 to see if it does, but I did make many builds with all versions and it didn't show up.

[15:39] *** zakharyas joined
[15:39] <jmerelo> Zoffix: my hunch is that's it's an old version of some module included from Pod::To::BigPage. But it might also be some Mac thing. So no idea. As I say, not being able to reproduce it.

[16:37] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: how do I get "$SHA_OF_REQUIRED_BULID"?

[16:38] *** sno left
[16:38] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: well, what's the revision you need? 2017.11? that would be e0394b6acc44e439568bd8b5e767678cb60dcd43

[16:38] <Zoffix> "Not an lrzip file"

[16:38] <AlexDaniel> oh, because maybe it's a zstd archive?

[16:38] <Zoffix> I wanted 2018.02

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> tagged revisions are typically zstd

[16:39] *** mcmillhj joined
[16:39] <AlexDaniel> so use the other command

[16:39] <Zoffix> K, fuck it. I don't got zstd installed or in repos.

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> :(

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> that's a known issue, but unfortunately there's nothing that can compress rakudo builds as good as zstd does

[16:40] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: try 2018.02^ ? :)

[16:41] <Zoffix> but how do I get the sha?

[16:41] <AlexDaniel> b69bc8b9a934a0f0ed6bff1ad53714726a143ab8

[16:41] <Zoffix> "2017.11? that would be e0394b6acc44e439568bd8b5e767678cb60dcd43" <- how do you know this?

[16:41] <AlexDaniel> I used github…

[16:41] <Zoffix> You mean it's a commit sha?

[16:41] <AlexDaniel> went straight to releases, then clicked on a commit, then clicked on its parent

[16:41] <AlexDaniel> yes

[16:41] <Zoffix> Ahh

[16:44] <Zoffix> same thing not an lrzip file

[16:44] <AlexDaniel> ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh…

[16:44] <AlexDaniel> it's not, yes :(

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> sorry :(

[16:49] <Zoffix> .seen pmichaud 

[16:49] <yoleaux> I saw pmichaud 22 Mar 2018 09:56Z in #perl6: <pmichaud> happy spring equinox to all

[16:49] <Zoffix> 6 days until rakudo.org goes dark... Gonna be pretty lame if we don't swap it to a new host in time :\

[16:57] <Bowlslaw> WHAT?!

[16:58] <Zoffix> What?

[17:02] <Bowlslaw> Zoffix: 6 days until rakudo.org goes dark... Gonna be pretty lame if we don't swap it to a new host in time :\

[17:02] <Bowlslaw> that's really a problem?

[17:03] <Zoffix> Is that a statement or a question? :)

[17:03] <El_Che> no, the owner of the domain if away. The (new) site has moved but the domain info must be switched

[17:03] <Bowlslaw> i'm just surprised it's an issue

[17:04] <Bowlslaw> does perl 6 not have the support it needs?

[17:04] <Zoffix> heh

[17:04] <lizmat> well, one could argue that that is true in this case if rakudo.org goes black

[17:05] <Zoffix> Bowlslaw: I'd argue it's merely the case of a person who's no longer very active holding the keys to few resources, like domain registration. So it's hard to reach them, even if the things to be done are trivial to do (like enabling HTTPS or swapping domain to new IP)

[17:06] <Zoffix> Bowlslaw: the site itself has already moved: http://perl6.org:4242/  just need to change DNS entries

[17:06] <Bowlslaw> ah, i see

[17:06] <AlexDaniel> geez I love this design so much

[17:09] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: quite cool, actually.

[17:12] <Zoffix> jmerelo: for the docs indexing issue, somehow `find-definitions` never returns and so `find-references` call that follows it never gets called.

[17:13] <Zoffix> So far I traced up to Perl6::Documentable.new and if I change nextsame to just self.Mu::new I can see that it never returns and the problem seems to be with something in %_ because if I try to dump it, I get infinite loop of dumpage.

[17:13] <jmerelo> Zoffix: but why does it happen only for some pages?

[17:15] <jmerelo> Zoffix: by never returns you mean that the program hangs? So far it seems to be running and processing the two pages that have not been indexed alright. It's as if it simply skips all definitions from the first one.

[17:15] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: my OSD tickets are probably very annoying 😂 https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/issues/3

[17:15] <jmerelo> Has there been any change in that part of the code recently?

[17:15] <Zoffix> jmerelo: by never returns I mean if I stick a debug print after the call to find-definitions, it never gets printed.

[17:15] <Zoffix> jmerelo: as I've said, this may be a rakudo bug

[17:17] *** aindilis left
[17:17] <Zoffix> jmerelo: also, why do you think this is something recent?

[17:17] <Zoffix> The indexing breakage I mean

[17:17] <jmerelo> It wasn't there when I fixed ?? !!

[17:18] <Zoffix> jmerelo: do you remember the date when that happened?

[17:18] <jmerelo> I'm trying to get the issue

[17:19] <jmerelo> Zoffix: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1851 I closed it 20 days ago, had to open it back when it disappeared, along all the indexed terms in operators.pod6

[17:23] <Zoffix> gonna try building 21-day old rakudo and seeing if problem is there

[17:26] <jmerelo> Zoffix++

[17:34] <Zoffix> `make test` on this box takes about the same time as `make stresstest` on my 24-core box :)

[18:53] * [Coke] gets bitten by the rakudo build update bug despite seeing it mentioned like 4 different places. whoops. (at least the workaround was already found. :)

[18:53] <yoleaux> 8 Apr 2018 12:32Z <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: can you write a description for ｢new｣ label on https://github.com/perl6/doc/labels ? Because I think it's currently being misused often

[18:53] <yoleaux> 8 Apr 2018 12:42Z <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1909

[18:53] <jmerelo> This question on the perl6 tag has gone unanswered for some time. Can someone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36864006/why-does-this-documentation-example-fail-is-my-workaround-an-acceptable-equival

[18:53] <yoleaux> 17:48Z <lizmat> jmerelo: have been playing with your algorithm: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/b33a04cf7f1ef4c5e6a19fe4660985f2

[18:54] <jmerelo> lizmat++ 

[18:54] <jmerelo> lizmat: you're great. Thanks. 

[18:54] <jmerelo> lizmat: which version would that be?

[18:55] <jmerelo> I guess it would work pretty much everywhere. Thanks!

[18:56] *** jmerelo left
[18:58] <lizmat> .tell jmerelo that would be blead: I improved the handling of native arrays in those respects quite a bit

[18:58] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[18:58] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: wrote one for that and many others.

[18:58] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: thank you

[18:59] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: do we need to have "good first issue" and "LHF" ?

[19:00] <[Coke]> jmerelo, AlexDaniel : renamed "TPF Grant" label to "JJ TPF Grant" label.

[19:01] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I'd remove "experimental" - no description, no tickets.

[19:01] <[Coke]> I'd also remove "bug" - we have more specific tags for bugs, e.g. "build", "site", "xt"...

[19:02] <[Coke]> (or, treat "bug" more like "docs" where we have other labels with the same color that are considered sub-types.)

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> experimental deleted

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> there were 2 tickets

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> (closed)

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: LHF is a perl6 thingy, but github only understands “good first issue”

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> so-o-o… I think we can go with “good first issue”

[19:03] <AlexDaniel> especially given that everybody keeps asking what LHF is

[19:04] <AlexDaniel> but that'd need some retagging

[19:04] <[Coke]> I think the one "pod" ticket is really an external for pod-to-html

[19:04] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I'll start moving them.

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> ok POD label removed

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> but maybe it can come back if we want to differentiate

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> in that case the tag can be “POD::To::HTML” :)

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: yes, there are better labels than ｢bug｣

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> I didn't even know that label existed :)

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: do we need ｢duplicate｣ ?

[19:12] <[Coke]> eh. probably not.

[19:12] <[Coke]> all LHF's moved to the new one.

[19:13] <AlexDaniel> ok, deleted ｢duplicate｣

[19:13] <[Coke]> Not sure what "help wanted" is meant to indicate.

[19:13] <[Coke]> I'd kill that one.

[19:13] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: that's another github thingie IIRC

[19:14] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: https://help.github.com/articles/helping-new-contributors-find-your-project-with-labels/

[19:15] <AlexDaniel> ok that link doesn't show what happens when you do that

[19:15] <AlexDaniel> but basically, whenever a non-contributor goes to doc/issues there's a popup

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> https://screenshots.firefox.com/2YxEnx9stLc4OR6f/github.com

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> this one

[19:17] <AlexDaniel> maybe we don't need to have both, I don't know

[19:26] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: if you can relabel ｢bug｣ then we can delete it too

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> heh, annual label cleanup

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> .tell dalek You still there? :)

[19:31] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to dalek.

[23:14] <timotimo> i wonder if i got what liz had

[23:15] <timotimo> something flu-like

[23:17] <Zoffix> thundergnat: I see the bug. Fix coming up

[23:17] <thundergnat> Awesome.

[23:24] <Zoffix> m: use nqp; dd nqp::null_s.DEFINITE; # wonder if this should be fixed instead

[23:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 518f2c319: OUTPUT: «Bool::True␤»

[23:24] <timotimo> hm, make definite behave differently on strings?

[23:25] <timotimo> null_s is the empty string, right?

[23:25] <Zoffix> Don't think so

[23:25] <Zoffix> m: use nqp; my str $x; dd $x; dd nqp::isnull_s($x); $x = nqp::null_s; dd nqp::isnull_s($x); dd $x; # last one dies

[23:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar 518f2c319: OUTPUT: «""␤0␤1␤chars requires a concrete string, but got null␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:25] <timotimo> indeed, it does assign a null

[23:41] <Zoffix> (nm, I don't see the bug anymore, so the fix isn't coming right up :P)

[23:41] <Zoffix> ZofBot: Oh whyy... whyyy didn't I break its legs?

[23:41] <ZofBot> Zoffix, ” And she said, “ know

[23:43] <thundergnat> Ah well, I'm sure the fix is still coming up, just not quite as speedy as you first thought. Zoffix++ anyway.
