[00:01] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: In some ways, a feature of my post was that we can test the route impl even without having written the real store. :-) But yes, of course a Red impl of it is a nice thing :)

[00:02] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Feel free to put it up as a sample app somewhere

[00:02] <jnthn> Though note the suggest-tree would need to check for if there's a tree already submitted at that location :)

[00:03] <jnthn> You already have the unique constraints, so probably can map an exception into the domain exception

[00:04] <jnthn> And yes, if the Red example you wrote there already really works, please do put it in the ecosystem. :)

[01:43] <jnthn> SmokeMachine: Lovely. The CATCH is a catching absolutely everything rather than just a constraint failure; perhaps it's hard to portably know that's what is wrong, but if it were possible, that'd be neat

[01:44] <jnthn> (I've a similar situation on a $dayjob app, but there's only one DB being used there, and I just do a /UNIQUE/ or some such on the error message... :)

[02:49] *** HarmtH left
[02:52] <timotimo> doesn't look bad, SmokeMachine, but i hope there can be a prettier way to add that unique constraint in there

[02:52] <timotimo> maybe red could, like, call all methods with a specific name where you could do setup like that?

[02:53] <timotimo> since model surely already has something like a specific compose phase or something

[02:53] <timotimo> maybe even $*RED.add-unique-constraint?

[02:53] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: if its a single column unique constraint, you do: `has Type $.col-name is column{ :unique }`

[02:54] <SmokeMachine> you could do `Tree.^add-unique-constraint`

[03:01] <timotimo> true

[03:11] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: what do you think of releasing Red?

[03:23] <timotimo> release early, release often :)

[03:23] <timotimo> i'd say it looks quite good, release it :)

[03:39] <timotimo> er

[03:39] <timotimo> no need for the long url actually

[03:39] <SmokeMachine> does that highlight perl6?

[03:40] <timotimo> not really :|

[03:40] <timotimo> maybe we can get them to, though?

[03:40] <SmokeMachine> we could try... :)

[03:42] <timotimo> btw, how do you feel about a trait or something that prevents methods on the HOW to be called from anything other than methods of the model itself? :)

[03:42] <timotimo> hm. probably a better idea to have a private attribute with the model inside instead?

[03:43] <SmokeMachine> I think something like that could be a good idea!

[07:29] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v rindolf

[07:29] <sacomo> does anyone know of a way to detect if a test is being run during `zef install` from inside the .t file?

[07:32] *** domidumont joined
[07:32] <moritz> sacomo: what do you want to achieve?

[07:33] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v domidumont

[07:34] <sacomo> I can use an env var or move a test to xt, but I am looking for a simple way to skip a test during install only. just wondering if there is some exposed envvar or flag that indicates a test is being run during module installation. 

[07:36] <jmerelo> sacomo: I don't think so. What you are looking for is a test that only runs during zef test but not during zef install?

[07:38] <jmerelo> sacomo: There could be some way, but it will probably be a hack and not supported... 

[07:39] <sacomo> yeah, that is what I was thinking. ok, no worries. I will just move it to xt.

[07:39] <sacomo> thanks

[07:39] <jmerelo> sacomo: that's probably the wise thing to do.

[07:39] <jmerelo> sacomo: ugexe, the main zef author, is usually active in StackOverflow. You can try and ask there too.

[07:40] <sacomo> ok, thanks

[07:41] <jmerelo> sacomo: what you are proposing, anyway, it's a very interesting idea. A zef introspection API would be a nice thing. Maybe expose the phase as a dynamic variable, or simply as a Zef::API call.

[07:44] <sacomo> yeah, I can think of a few uses for something like this

[07:44] <Xliff> Someone have any idea on the best way to release something that takes almost 40 minutes to precompile?

[07:45] <Xliff> Would love some ideas. Thanks! 

[07:45] <Xliff> o/

[07:45] <jmerelo> Xliff: as in, a note saying "hang in there, buster, some way to go?"

[07:45] <jmerelo> Xliff: or you want to make that time shorter?

[07:46] <jmerelo> Xliff: Whenever something takes a long time to do something I stuff it into a Docker container. Compile once, download it in no time.

[07:46] <jmerelo> Xliff: but I don't know if that's what you're looking for. Probably not.

[07:49] <moritz> Xliff: are you generating rainbow tables at compile time? :D

[17:30] <ufobat> Injector looks magical :)

[17:31] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: :) is it a good thing?! :P

[17:32] <ufobat> that is not a right questionfor a perl6 adept

[17:33] <ufobat> you dont have much boilerplate, i like it

[17:34] <ufobat> it is not obivous how it works

[17:35] <SmokeMachine> When I was writing it my first thought was to port Bread::Board but then I thought it could look more perl6...

[17:36] <SmokeMachine> (Even for me... I don‚Äôt think I remember how it work...)

[17:37] <ufobat> i need to admit, from the README.md and the example i dont know how to use it correctly, how to do block injection and stuff like this

[17:38] *** reach_satori left
[17:40] <ufobat> i started a module called XML::Rabbit, do you know that, SmokeMachine? that does also exist in perl5

[17:42] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: there is no block inject...

[17:43] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: no... I haven‚Äôt known... reading it...

[17:43] <ufobat> dont read my module, i failed on it

[17:44] <ufobat> have a look at the original

[17:45] <ufobat> i was just reminded on this, when you said "do it more in the perl6 way"

[17:46] <moritz> also, "don't exaggerate"

[17:46] <SmokeMachine> That looks fun!

[17:47] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: are you writing it?

[17:47] <ufobat> writing what?

[17:47] <SmokeMachine> moritz: is there such a thing as ‚Äútoo much perl6‚Äù?

[17:48] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: the perl6 XML::Rabbit

[17:49] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: still writing that?

[17:49] *** zacts left
[17:49] <ufobat> I just started it, I am currently not giving it any love :-(

[17:53] <SmokeMachine> I have a problem: when I see something that looks fun, I tend to stop everything I‚Äôm doing to do that ‚Äúshine thing‚Äù...

[17:53] <SmokeMachine> But I‚Äôll not get any new module to write until I release Red

[17:55] <SmokeMachine> Does any one here live on the uk?

[17:55] <ufobat> i am looking forward for Red

[18:01] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: really? Do you feel like using it?

[18:02] <ufobat> i would give it a go instead of using DBIish directly for a project i am doing with a friend

[18:05] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: what do you think of using it and help me finding bugs and missing features?

[18:06] <ufobat> a friend of mine is doing the perl6 part, in this project. i already recommended Red to him. but he is gone for 1-2 weeks for xmas holidays

[18:06] <ufobat> of course I would write issues and such if I run intro troubles

[18:36] <tadzik> hmm

[18:36] <tadzik> maybe https://github.com/tadzik/ClassX-StrictConstructor hasn't :)

[18:37] <SmokeMachine> Hum! StrictClass!

[18:37] <SmokeMachine> What‚Äôs the bug?

[18:38] <ufobat> let me write a test :-)

[18:42] *** pmurias left
[18:44] <ufobat> the funny thing is, in my real world problem i do get a different error

[18:46] <ufobat> SmokeMachine, could it behave different depending if you put the classes and roles in a seperate file

[18:47] <SmokeMachine> ufobat: I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not with my computer now...

[18:48] <ufobat> SmokeMachine, no worries could you have a look at it later in the next couple of days?

[18:49] <SmokeMachine> Sure! As soon as I come home...

[18:50] <ufobat> awesome :-)

[18:50] <ufobat> and in the meanwhile i'll prove that there are bugs in tadziks module ;-)

[19:21] <SmokeMachine> nadim: sorry, what?

[19:22] <nadim> Maybe I misunderstood from the conversation above, thought you wrote Injector

[19:22] <SmokeMachine> nadim: yes, I did

[19:23] <nadim> what is it?

[19:23] <nadim> not obvious to me from the readme

[19:24] <SmokeMachine> It‚Äôs a ioc the same idea of the ufobat‚Äôs IOC

[19:25] <SmokeMachine> nadim: but you just add an `is injected` where you want to inject stuff...

[19:25] <SmokeMachine> And `bind()` what you want to be injected...

[19:26] <nadim> I'll look at Stevan's module, there's documentation ;)

[19:26] <rindolf> nadim: hi

[19:27] <nadim> rindolf: hi

[19:28] <rindolf> nadim: sup?

[19:28] <SmokeMachine> nadim: I don‚Äôt know how to explain ioc... I think that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt write a good doc...

[19:28] <rindolf> SmokeMachine: inversion of control?

[19:28] <nadim> SmokeMachine: steal the doc from Bread::Board ;)

[19:28] <moritz> internet of crap :)

[19:28] <rindolf> moritz: heh

[19:29] <SmokeMachine> rindolf: yes

[19:29] <SmokeMachine> nadim: that is a good idea! :)

[19:31] <SmokeMachine> nadim: do you understand at least a little what Injector does?

[19:32] <nadim> little, run time dependency, aka comfiguration, kind plugins that have to be plugged in. what I got after 3min, I may be completely wrong

[19:33] <nadim> 20 years old concet/name and it's the first time I hear about it!

[19:34] <moritz> the idea is: if A needs B, it doesn't instantiate B itself, but gets the B supplied from the outside

[19:35] *** trex42 left
[19:35] <moritz> a Web Scraper needs a HTTP user agent: it doesn't built it itself, it just declares that it needs one

[19:36] <moritz> and then you can use outside configuration to supply a HTTP user agent that conforms to the desired API

[19:36] <nadim> that's what I meant with plugins that have to be plugged in

[19:37] <nadim> sorta pure virtual functions in c++ except that the instantiation is done somewhere else

[19:39] *** domidumont left
[19:39] <SmokeMachine> The beauty of this is that if I want to test that web scraper, I can change the http use agent without changing the web scraper and mock it...

[19:40] *** kst left
[19:41] <nadim> isn't it exactly what we have doing with plugins for 40 years?

[19:41] <moritz> it's not a new idea :)

[19:41] <moritz> it's also not a complicated thing

[19:42] <nadim> indeed not, composition is old as linux pipeline

[19:42] <nadim> I don't see the usage pattern (when/where/why) but get the principle

[19:47] <nadim> seen timotimo around?

[23:18] *** |oLa| joined
[23:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v |oLa|

[23:20] <timotimo> you should be able to do much of the same stuff as OO::Monitors, but instead of ClassHOW use the right other HOW, there are multiple with "Role" or "Parametric" in their name, one of them is the right one

[23:23] *** SqrtNegInf left
[23:24] <vrurg> timotimo: The problem is that role is being initialized differently. Look into Actions.nqp, line 3157.

[23:25] *** ferreira left
[23:25] <vrurg> It doesn't matter what HOW is used ‚Äì would it be ParametricRoleHOW itself ‚Äì if the keyword is not 'role' then one gets the error.

[23:25] <timotimo> curious

[23:26] *** rindolf left
[23:26] <timotimo> right, that makes sense. huh.

[23:26] <jnthn> Yeah, it's hard-coded on the $*PKGDECL at the moment. Probably it should be replaced with looking at $*PACKAGE.HOW.archetypes.parametric or whatever it's called

[23:26] <timotimo> sounds like it'd be $package instead of $*PACKAGE, maybe

[23:26] <jnthn> I didn't look at the code :P

[23:26] <jnthn> I think there is a dynamic though :)

[23:27] <timotimo> yeah, $*LEAF

[23:27] <jnthn> But yeah, if there's a local then use that :)

[23:27] <timotimo> i want to be leaf

[23:27] <jnthn> I be leaf in you

[23:27] <jnthn> I'm fine with patching it to look at archetypes instead, anyway.

[23:28] <jnthn> I think the code may pre-date the archetypes existing

[23:28] <jnthn> And then nobody tried to do their own role-y meta-objects until now

[23:28] <timotimo> vrurg++ # operating at the edge of known science

[23:28] <jnthn> Indeed :)

[23:29] <jnthn> I'm glad to see more and more folks doing MOP stuff. At first I was like, "oh no, have I created something only I understand to use?" :)

[23:30] <vrurg> jnthn: So far, it's only you, I'm afraid. But I hope to get back on this same time next year... ;)

[23:30] <timotimo> i've also been MOPing! well, last time was a couple of years ago already ...

[23:31] <jnthn> Yeah, SmokeMachine++ has been making nice use of the meta-level in Red also :)

[23:31] <timotimo> .archetypes.databasy

[23:33] <vrurg> Since we're taking on this... Where can I find an example of patching the grammar? I've seen it before, just can't recall...

[23:33] <timotimo> slangs, like tuxic for example

[23:33] <jnthn> Various Slang:: modules would be doing it

[23:34] <timotimo> you probably want to look at the refine-slang method on ... something :)

[23:35] <vrurg> Exactly! Thanks!

[23:38] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: thanks! :)

[23:38] *** jeek left
[23:38] <nadim> timotimo: so what was you DDT/6Pad integration idea?

[23:39] <vrurg> timotimo: hm, neither googling, nor grepping came up with anything on refine-slang. Kidding me?

[23:39] <timotimo> i must have remembered it wrong

[23:40] <timotimo> nadim: i'm not entirely sure yet; i think the whateverables should be able to output a gist of the right "format", so we could totally have a regexable bot that dumps a match object, or even cooler: give a steppable little html interface from a regex trace

[23:40] <vrurg> Nevermind... I have enough now. It's about a very simple injection of a single keyword.

[23:41] <timotimo> ok, it has to be define_slang

[23:41] <timotimo> i thought a refine_slang also existed

[23:42] *** i1nfusion left
[23:43] <nadim> timotimo: I am not following, yet, is it a regex dump you want to give (including the steps it takes) or any object dunp? automatically or under the user control? 

[23:43] <timotimo> all of those would be interesting, i think

[23:44] *** i1nfusion joined
[23:44] <timotimo> like, it could put the input text and starting regex into the 6pad, maybe also in a textarea with an "evaluate" button to allow for experimentation without recompiling the code itself

[23:44] <nadim> I just noticed that it is not possible to use a module through the interface

[23:44] <timotimo> and outputting the match object with DDT should be a nice possibility

[23:44] <timotimo> that's possibly just a matter of having the right $*REPO built for the job

[23:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v i1nfusion

[23:45] <timotimo> pmurias would probably know how to do this

[23:45] <nadim> timotimo: let me check what example I have, I haven't touched this for a year

[23:47] <timotimo> that's fine. i probably need a bit of time with a notepad :)

[23:48] <nadim> if you install the latest version of DDT, there is an example/match,pl in the distro

[23:49] <nadim> It shows multiple ways to dump a match

[23:50] <nadim> they are all much shorter than the standard dd output

[23:50] *** Manifest0 left
[23:51] <nadim> DDT doesn't dump matches by default, it's an extra role. So it would be easy to modify if we want something else

[23:51] <nadim> and there is all the filtering one can do to make things even better looking
