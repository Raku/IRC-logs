[09:20] <AlexDaniel> do we even have that?

[10:42] *** pierre__ left
[10:44] <samcv> but nqp::encodeconf and nqp::encoderepconf are default strict. with 6.d the one byte encodings will become strict by default. also notable is that nqp::decoderep needs strict for it to be able to replace anything

[10:44] <samcv> decoderep is new in the last week or so

[10:45] <samcv> plus the *conf ones. but decoderep didnt exist at all. the other are just variations on the previous ones

[11:09] <tyil> Perl 5 is older and seems to have more widespread use, Perl 6 is still busy taking off in that regard.

[12:11] <masak> I can see why a question like aldaco's feels like a "oh no, it's more like this" in the Perl 6 world/bubble, but feels more like a latent threat for p5ers.

[12:12] <El_Che> masak: and for perl 6 as in "why are there more modules/jobs/... for the older version than for the new one"?

[12:12] <masak> (but the question of renaming/rebranding doesn't interest me in the slightest)

[12:12] <El_Che> you're more of the philosopher type :)

[12:13] <masak> I think in retrospect we can all agree that, yeah, it was unfortunate to just call it "the next major version" and to use the same language name. I'm curious if it *could* have been handled in a better way (while still calling it Perl 6).

[12:14] <masak> I mean, even Python 3, a much more modest language change, has had its definite challenges along the way.

[12:14] <El_Che> but that *was* the next version

[12:14] <El_Che> even if some people didn't liek it

[12:14] <El_Che> like

[12:14] <masak> well, so was Perl 6.

[12:15] <El_Che> not by the time it was out

[12:15] <masak> we are in agreement.

[12:15] <El_Che> when it stated, it was certainly the right choice to call it 6

[12:16] <El_Che> as time kept slipping away, the Perl wasn't the part but the version locking of wat whas the stable version

[12:16] <El_Che> when runtime and language diverted and something was out, Perl was out of vogue

[12:19] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: are you saying he didn't know? pretty sure I saw the email go out to him.

[12:19] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: yes, yesterday he clearly said that he doesn't know

[12:21] <[Coke]> Email was sent to his address 4 days ago.

[12:21] <El_Che> jj? he didn't know who his manager was

[12:22] <[Coke]> Yes. he was notified 4 days ago.

[12:22] <[Coke]> Have him check his spam filter, I guess.

[12:22] <El_Che> something go lost, I'll ping him when I see him

[12:24] <[Coke]> I responded to the email, maybe that'll help bring it back to his inbox. Thank you, El_Che

[13:46] <Zoffix> .tell tyil your article is potentially confusing ( https://www.tyil.nl/tutorials/perl6-introduction-to-application-programming/ ). It says "After this, the bins exposed by Perl 6 need to be updated: `rakudobrew rehash`". That's just a quirk of rakudobrew. It's the only time rakudobrew is mentioned in the article, and it is a piece of software that's actively being discouraged due to its deficiencies and isn't

[13:46] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to tyil.

[13:46] <Zoffix> used by most users. You also end the article by saying $PATH needs to be rehashed in most shells.. Isn't that the glitch of rakudobrew too? I don't need to rehash anything in bash and I don't use rakudobrew.

[13:58] <jkramer> Did you experience a similar problem and is there anything I can do about it?

[14:01] <Zoffix> jkramer: yeah, I experienced it but never had time to debug it. Looks like https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client/issues/40 and is mentioned in https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client/issues/50

[14:01] *** cdg left
[14:03] <jkramer> Hmm too bad :(

[14:03] <tyil> Zoffix: that rakudobrew part is because its used in the tutorial before it that installs Perl 6 (using rakudobrew)

[14:03] <yoleaux> 13:46Z <Zoffix> tyil: your article is potentially confusing ( https://www.tyil.nl/tutorials/perl6-introduction-to-application-programming/ ). It says "After this, the bins exposed by Perl 6 need to be updated: `rakudobrew rehash`". That's just a quirk of rakudobrew. It's the only time rakudobrew is mentioned in the article, and it is a piece of software that's actively being discouraged due to its deficiencies and isn't

[14:03] <yoleaux> 13:47Z <Zoffix> tyil: used by most users. You also end the article by saying $PATH needs to be rehashed in most shells.. Isn't that the glitch of rakudobrew too? I don't need to rehash anything in bash and I don't use rakudobrew.

[14:03] <tyil> also, rehashing is simply a thing shells sometimes need when you add something to $PATH, some shells these days dont require it anymore, but better be safe than sorry I guess

[14:04] <Zoffix> jkramer: possible first step in debugging would be sticking `CATCH { default { warn $_; warn .backtrace } }` in some of the async places. Maybe there's an exception being thrown that's being silently ignored.

[14:05] <tyil> Zoffix: I could add a note saying you'll need the rakudobrew rehash part only if you installed using rakudobrew as used in <previous article>

[14:05] <El_Che> tyil: I am been using unix shells for +20y and I have never rehashed my shell except for apps like rakudobrew and the similar tool for perl 5

[14:06] <El_Che> except if by rehash you mean sourcing

[14:06] <tyil> no, by rehash I mean `rehash` or `hash -r` depending on the shell

[14:07] <tyil> might be that I'm wrong, I just prefer to add that part so I can be sure everything is ok

[14:07] <El_Che> tyil: times that I have done that on Solaris, AIX and Linux: 0

[14:07] <El_Che> must be running a linux desktop from around 1999

[14:08] <Zoffix> tyil: why tell people to install rakudobrew in the first place? It's buggy, by default it installs minimally tested dev commits instead of releases, it causes awful paths in default USAGE messages in all Perl 6 scripts, and you have to reinstall modules each time you upgrade.

[14:09] <Zoffix> And you have to `rakudobrew rehash` each time you install binaries :)

[14:11] <Zoffix> (FWIW, there are third-party instructions to create a bash alias for updating to latest release (and no rehashing/module reinstallation needed): https://github.com/zoffixznet/r#table-of-contents ); (rakudo.org will also gonna be updated in 0-3 weeks to include more comprehensive and easier-to-navigate installation instructions: http://perl6.org:4242/files )

[14:11] <tyil> Zoffix: because it used to be reasonably popular from my experience, and for most people it's (seems) easier than cloning source and compiling that

[14:12] <eater> time to make our own rakudobrew with blackjack and hookers

[14:12] <eater> rakudown

[14:12] <tyil> eater: late to the party

[14:12] <tyil> rakudup or something already exists

[14:13] <tbrowder_>  [Coke]: the command is from Zoffix’s Toaster: zef —/cached —debug install $module —install-to=$dir

[14:14] <eater> lol

[14:14] <tbrowder_> note “—/cached”, not “—/cache”

[14:14] <tyil> eater: when r we gonna do a cool p6 project together :333

[14:14] <tyil> I did have plans for a querybuilder if you feel bored 

[14:14] <Zoffix> But you have to set it up first, just as you have to setup the alias. So if we assume that part is equivalent, then the alternatives are far easier. You either *just* have to type `update-perl6` once in a while to fetch latest version. Or you (1) have to find out what's the current latest release if you don't want to risk severe bugs; (2) have to know to type correct installation command including correct

[14:14] <Zoffix> backend and release number; (3) re-install the modules you want to use; (4) run `rakudobrew rehash` to update binary shims; (5) repeat this entire process any time you want to upgrade.

[14:14] <tbrowder_> eater: o/

[14:15] <Zoffix> I'm not buying the "it's easier to use rakudobrew" argument at all.

[14:15] <moritz> it's easy to get started with, and then you get entangled in all of its warts

[14:15] <tyil> Zoffix: to the "average" user, the idea to "get this tool and tell it to install" is easier to sell than "now lets compile from source manually"

[14:15] <Zoffix> tyil: but you're not compiling anything.

[14:15] <eater> tbrowder_: \o

[14:16] <Zoffix> tyil: you run `update-perl6`. That's all there is to it.

[14:16] <eater> anyway, anyone know how I get const's from header files inside Perl 6

[14:17] <eater> I'm afraid this has to be done in the VM

[14:17] <tyil> I am aware, I'm using such a script myself, but if I look at the alias in your repo, it sure as hell looks more daunting than a simple git clone, init, build

[14:17] <tyil> if there were up-to-date builds in distro repos the issues would be resolved altogether, tbh

[14:18] <eater> mfw VoidLinux has that

[14:19] <tyil> tfw gentoo seems to have dropped their outdated perl6 builds and now has none :(

[14:19] <tyil> I should get back to maintaining those ebuilds myself

[14:24] <Zoffix> tyil: the alias is a copy-pasteable set of commands. Yours have `$` in them and have to be copied individually. Yours also follow by a set of additional commands and advice to follow notices, while the alias is all done. You're also ignoring entirely that your instruction build a minimally tested random development commit rather than a stable release. That has the potential for the user to get extremely broken

[14:24] <Zoffix> perl6 that in a rare circumstance could have a system-damaging bug. Yet, you don't even mention that fact in your tutorial and if you had, you'd have a lot more instructions for finding the latest stable release and specifying its version. Lastly, the user is forced to reinstall all modules on each upgrade and has to run a rakudobrew command after installing any binaries—the caveat you were even forced to

[14:24] <Zoffix> mention in another article. None of that is needed with the alias or the copy-pasteable instructions that build latest star. Seems to me saying that rakudobrew's usage is less daunting is intellectually dishonest.

[14:24] <Zoffix> And IMO it's irresponsible to tell unaware users to install development versions of software using a discouraged tool.

[14:26] <tyil> I'm being called dishonest for trying my best to make Perl 6 articles to promote it :/

[14:26] <tyil> the real issue to me is still that there's no straightforward, user-friendly way to get a recent Perl 6 installed on their machines

[14:27] <eater> then... solve that problem?

[14:28] <tyil> calling me dishonest for not going with your personal favorite solution sounds pretty silly

[14:41] <robertle> for my own understanding: the problem some distros have with the packaging is that the pre-compiled perl6 modules installed on a system somewhat depend on the version of rakudo? so if you upgrade rakudo you have to do something to re-compile these already installed modules?

[14:59] <Zoffix> tyil: my point wasn't in using my alias, but in not using rakudobrew. Instead of linking to the alias, I'd recommend you link to https://perl6.org/downloads/ that way the users will get the best "officially supported" options.

[14:59] <Zoffix> (that page will see some improvements in a month or two)

[15:00] <tyil> I'll see what I'll do, I don't really feel like updating it after your recent comments

[15:00] <eater> m: constant A = %( :B(10.rand.ceiling) ); enum C ( A ); say B ~ '=' ~ B.value;

[15:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3e4f9e3e: OUTPUT: «B=3␤»

[15:00] <eater> :D

[15:02] <Zoffix> m: my \A = %( :B(10.rand.ceiling) ); enum C (A);

[15:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3e4f9e3e: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Cannot find method 'List' on object of type Mu␤»

[15:03] <Zoffix> filed as R#1637

[15:04] <cfa> tyil: re: your change, i was thinking it might be nice to also list standard digraph bindings for common operators

[15:04] <tyil> that could be useful

[15:04] <cfa> i mean, they're discoverable but vim spews a _lot_ of digraphs out

[15:05] <tyil> yeah, we only need the ones that can be used in Perl 6

[15:05] <cfa> and stuff like ^K1s and ^K1S aren't abbreved, i think

[15:05] <cfa> (sub and super)

[15:06] <tyil> seems not, no

[15:06] <tyil> we can probably add a table like we have in the docs to show all unicode ops and texas ops, and just add a column to show vim digraphs

[15:07] <cfa> that'd be nice, yeah

[15:07] *** Shoop left
[15:08] <tyil> should we extend the existing table, or add one in the input page and have a column for equivalent combinations in other editors

[15:10] <cfa> it should probably live in this 'entering unicode' section; people using other editors don't need to see vim digraph info

[15:30] <Zoffix> pmurias: the original discussion was about installation of **perl6** using the alias vs. rakudobrew being daunting.

[15:30] <yoleaux> 15:24Z <pmurias> Zoffix: installing rakudobrew feels less daunting, not sure why but the command you copy and paste being too long might be an issue

[15:31] *** sena_kun joined
[15:31] <Zoffix> What difference does it make if installing rakudobrew itself is a shorter command if you have to type have a dozen other commands to get proper installation of perl6?

[15:33] <Zoffix> s/have a/half a/;

[15:33] *** mcmillhj joined
[15:33] <Zoffix> And considering you have to type a rakudobrew command after each installation of binaries, the rakudobrew setup gets more daunting the longer you have it installed.

[15:35] <Zoffix> And considering you have to re-install all modules on upgrade, rakudobrew setup gets even more more daunting the longer you use perl6

[15:37] * [Coke] wonders if it would be possible to update rakudobrew to address the issues.

[15:38] <mst> rakudobrew is (a) a giant hack (b) specifically designed for people *developing* perl6

[15:38] <mst> for that purpose it's potentially rather useful

[15:38] <mst> if you're *using* perl6 it's completely the wrong design

[15:38] <cfa> the name's rather confusing for people using perlbrew

[15:38] <cfa> because it'll be thought of as an analogue

[15:38] <Zoffix> People just ignore that you're installing a random dev commit and ignore that you have to rehash binaries and then go "oh look, it's so easy!". Oh yeah, but then let's find bugs caused by rakudobrew and blame rakudo for them ( R#926 ), and have users be confused when they didn't rehash and couldn't find binaries ( https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2018-01-19#i_15711027 ) and then keep talking about how daunting

[15:38] <synopsebot> R#926 [closed]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/926 Usage replace $*PROG-NAME with literal “command”

[15:38] <Zoffix> all the alternatives even when offered much simpler alternatives

[15:38] <Zoffix> ZofBot: RAGE!

[15:38] <ZofBot> Zoffix, had to go to the dentist and have two of my molars out

[15:39] <mst> well, perlbrew is mostly for people writing cpan modules who need to test against multiple perls

[15:39] <Zoffix> mst: it isn't even useful for devs, now that we have committable6 bots letting us eval on different commits

[15:39] <mst> normal perl5 users shouldn't be using perlbrew most of the time either

[15:39] <[Coke]> mst: ? For me, perlbrew is for machines where I want to install a perl and not worry about system perl.

[15:39] <cfa> +1

[15:39] <cfa> and test on multiple versions

[15:40] <mst> [Coke]: that's plenv or Perl::Build

[15:40] <mst> using perlbrew for deployment is 100% insane

[15:40] <[Coke]> mst: never heard of either of those before just now.

[15:40] <mst> I regularly fix production systems by ripping perlbrew out

[15:41] <cfa> yeah, i'm not talking about deployment really

[15:41] <pmurias> Zoffix: re instructions doesn't https://github.com/zoffixznet/r#linux install the latest  commmit too?

[15:42] <mst> [Coke]: well you're not even in #perl anymore - if you cut yourself off from the community and don't ask questions, you may end up with 'copy and paste from stack overflow' quality solutions :)

[15:42] <cfa> i guess my point is perlbrew is a go to tool for installing a local modern perl without fuss; rakudobrew's name suggests it'll do the same

[15:42] <[Coke]> Neither am I, really. personal use on hosts where I need a perl tool.

[15:42] <cfa> it seems a bit unfair to blame users of the tool for associated warts

[15:42] <cfa> especially as the advice to stop using rakudobrew is fairly recent

[15:42] <[Coke]> mst: I've never been a regular there.

[15:43] <mst> if nobody's really using rakudbrew for its original purpose

[15:43] <mst> I would suggest it wouldn't be a terrible idea to say "stuff this" and write a "rakudobrew 2" that shares only the name

[15:43] <mst> and does what people who're trying to use it are expecting to get

[15:43] <[Coke]> Anyway, now that I know about plenv, I can check that out. but the plenv vs. perlbrew info in the plenv project doesn't really give a compelling use case for when you'd pick one over the other.

[15:43] <cfa> mst: agree

[15:43] <cfa> mst: rakduobrew should probably be for switching between release versions

[15:44] <Zoffix> pmurias: that was just outdated description text. The command itself installs latest release

[15:46] <yoleaux> I saw pmichaud 7 Mar 2018 19:20Z in #perl6: <pmichaud> tadzik!  \o/

[15:49] <pmurias> Zoffix: how installing Perl 6 feels is super important to getting people to try it

[15:49] <pmurias> for Rust they have something like this: https://www.rustup.rs/

[15:49] <Zoffix> pmurias: and is entirely pointless if the installed version is broken or worse, damages user's system.,

[15:50] <Zoffix> pmurias: we have `curl https://rakudup.github.io/rakudup -s | bash`

[15:51] <pmurias> Zoffix: yes, I'm not arguing that we should keep using rakudobrew when it's causing trouble

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> pmurias++

[16:52] <AlexDaniel> wait but what was the number before merge? :)

[16:53] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: not sure, spectests on roast takes a long time so I mostly rerun tests I work on

[16:53] <pmurias> (and I was using an old roast before the merge)

[16:56] <Zoffix> jkramer: I wonder if the extra pings get lost in the $leftovers https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client/blob/master/lib/IRC/Client.pm6#L210  They probably shouldn't since the grammar parses all complete events, but implementations are very lax with following the RFCs, so I wonder if the sent PINGs got extra stuff in 'em that prevent full parsing or something

[16:56] <ZofBot> Zoffix, Will remind you on 2018-03-28T12:56:43.507388-04:00 about hack on IRC::Client tickets

[16:56] <Zoffix> About time to knock down the bugs in that module. Gonna try to fix the ping stuff too :)

[16:57] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: and I know have a bunch of regressions to fix after the merge

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> pmurias++ too, of course :)

[16:58] <El_Che> pmurias: how does the js version compares in speed the the moarvm rakudo?

[17:00] <Herby_> pmurias: that's awesome

[17:02] <jkramer> Zoffix: Good point, I'll add some more debug-prints for that case. But just now I had an interesting new development. :) The bot was watching itself timing out. It dumped the PING to stdout but didn't react, then it dumped the messages from the IRC server about itself being disconnected due to a ping timeout :)

[17:02] <Zoffix> heh

[17:03] <jkramer> But that might be a different issue, it happened for the first time now. The times before it didn't dump a PING in the log or, if it did, it also sent a PONG.

[17:05] <jkramer> Oh wait that probably happened because of some debug code I added. :)

[17:05] <[Coke]> pmurias: perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --backends=js # fails on the JS branch, looking for an nqp tag that doesn't exist.

[17:20] <pmurias> El_Che: and for NQP I think changing the semantics a tiny bit could make huge speed ups

[17:21] <El_Che> how is the speed enhanced in node? JIT?

[17:26] <pmurias> El_Che: I don't understand the question

[17:27] <El_Che> pmurias: node itself is fast. How wonder how they got it so fast

[17:27] <[Coke]> make: *** No rule to make target `js-runner-default-install', needed by `install'.  Stop.

[17:28] <pmurias> make install is not supported yet :/

[17:28] <pmurias> El_Che: they use a JIT, with tons of effort by people who have been doing JITs for decades

[17:28] <[Coke]> pmurias: I never typed make install; that's coming off the build.

[17:28] <[Coke]> nqp's make install?

[17:29] <[Coke]> off /the build/rakudo's Configure.pl step/

[17:29] <El_Che> pmurias: and can rakudo code eventually use that JIT or it's something restricted to javascript?

[17:30] <pmurias> El_Che: it uses it, but there is a huge layer of inefficency because the code we generate is not optimal

[17:31] <El_Che> I see, thanks for the info!

[18:59] <Zoffix> stmuk_: there's this site that has a bunch of fonts (including free ones) https://www.dafont.com/ and you can you can use this site to create the CSS and things to embed a custom font on the site: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator

[18:59] <Zoffix> lichtkind: (List $ where .all ~~ Int)

[18:59] <Zoffix> lichtkind: (@foo where .all ~~ Int)

[19:00] *** kaare_ left
[19:00] <lichtkind> Zoffix thank you very much , i thought there are shortcuts for this

[19:00] <Zoffix> lichtkind: second one would take any List (and Array/Slip are subclasses of List). The third one would take any Positional

[19:00] <lichtkind> like [Int]

[19:00] <Zoffix> lichtkind: that's for parametarized types. You can parametarize an Array, but not a List

[19:01] <lichtkind> what does parameterize mean?

[19:01] <Zoffix> lichtkind: so those would contain just Ints, but in addition you'd also have to create a parametarized type when passing to the array

[19:03] <lichtkind> Zoffix, you mean only when i put a variable into the call not data?

[19:03] <Zoffix> m: -> @ where .all ~~ Int {}([1, 2, 3])

[19:04] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[19:05] <Zoffix> ^ you actually have to make a parametarized array to make it work. What "parametarized" means. Dunno there are some docs on it ( https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#index-entry-Parameterized_Roles ). Basically, Array[Int] says it'll only contain Int stuff ahead of time, or something

[19:05] *** mcmillhj left
[19:05] <lichtkind> Zoffix, thanks a lot becasue i start to write some serious code

[19:06] <lichtkind> i think i understood now

[19:06] <Zoffix> m: class Foo {}; my Foo @a; @a[0] := 42

[19:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar a3e4f9e3e: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller BIND-POS(Array[Foo]: Int, Int); none of these signatures match:␤    (Array:D $: int $pos, Foo \bindval, *%_)␤    (Array:D $: Int:D $pos, Foo \bindval, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:07] <Zoffix> ^ if you try to use a different type there isn't even a method to bind it. The signatures for binding method are automatically typed even.

[21:40] <Herby_> two minor bits of feedback: I wasn't able to get App::Assixt to install

[21:40] <tyil> I might make another one in a project to proxy tweets from the perl6 news twitter to mastodon (since this is something I'd like to have anyway)

[21:40] <Herby_> and the code in "Creating the elements" section is a tad bit different than the final product

[21:40] <Herby_> as far as the label names

[21:40] <tyil> the latter one should be easy to fix

[21:40] <tyil> could you open an issue with the error you get when trying to install App::Assixt?

[21:41] <tyil> I'd be interested in solving that if possible

[21:41] <Herby_> sure. I'm a github rookie but I'll give it a shot

[21:41] *** mcmillhj joined
[21:41] <tyil> add a perl6 --version if you make an issue :>

[21:42] <Herby_> will do

[21:42] <tyil> https://github.com/scriptkitties/perl6-App-assixt/issues that's the repo

[21:43] <tyil> I'm probably going to bed soon-ish, but I can probably look at it tomorrow 

[21:43] <Herby_> sounds good, i'll work on getting it submitted

[21:43] <tyil> thanks!

[21:45] <timotimo> Herby_: to be honest, jnthn did the first bunch of work on it and i just continued the same way he started, and a lot of extra work was done by azawawi iirc, so i feel a little uneasy calling it mine :)

[22:04] <tyil> Herby_: could I ask you to run `zef --force install zef` to ensure you're on the latest zef version?

[22:04] <Herby_> sure one sec

[22:09] *** mcmillhj left
[22:09] <Herby_> k. ran that command, and tried install App::Assixt again, errored out

[22:10] <tyil> its test 6 that's failing, but it only fails on the Rakudo Star release, not my local installation  (2018.02)

[22:10] <tyil> so I'll have to figure out why it's being a pain

[22:10] <Herby_> is there a way to confirm what version of Zef i'm using?

[22:11] <tyil> zef info zef maybe?

[22:11] <tyil> not sure

[22:11] <tyil> lets downgrade my local perl6 to see if I can make it fail there too

[22:11] <Herby_> zef:ver<0.2.3>

[22:12] <El_Che> it's weird zef doesn't hava a --version parameter

[22:12] <tyil> the odd thing is the "error" it gives: t/06-deduce-parser.t .. All 4 subtests passed 

[22:13] <tyil> it also plans 4, and all subtests have plans according to their amount of runs

[22:13] <tyil> prove -e "perl6 -Ilib" -v t also says everything is ok

[22:16] *** rindolf left
[22:28] *** itaipu left
