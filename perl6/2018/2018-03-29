[06:09] <moritz> o good morning

[06:11] <moritz> I've just received my royalty statement from my publisher; it seems that the regex book sold 113 print and 14 ebook copies in December when it came out

[06:12] <moritz> I don't quite know what numbers to compare it against to make sense of it, but if 100 people actually read the book, it was worth the effort :-)

[06:12] *** cdg left
[06:13] *** cdg joined
[06:14] <TEttinger> you wrote a book on regexes? perl 6 variety?

[06:15] <moritz> sure did: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/

[06:17] <moritz> and "Perl 6 Fundamentals" sold 76 print copies, 58 ebook in Q4 2017

[06:18] *** cdg left
[06:18] <moritz> TEttinger: seems I haven't spammed enough about it :-)

But I would like to get Proc::InvokeEditor working cross platform so it's useful so I feel I really need ot.

[13:34] <perlawhirl> hi perlers

[13:36] <perlawhirl> I'm probably going about this the wrong way... but say i want to move functions into their own sub-modules, but still be importable by the user

[13:36] <perlawhirl> is there a better way to go about it than this?

[13:36] <perlawhirl> https://gist.github.com/0racle/a8121cfbb8ba920dca3670d47ca1861a

[13:37] <perlawhirl> ie. without explicitly creating export packages for each sub-module

[15:59] <jnthn> It's all public content, and I'm not sure illicit Cro use is on any nasty government's radar. :P But it should be easy to add HTTPS. Just a matter of getting around to it.

[16:00] <FROGGS> no, but chrome wants to discourage all none https-sites at some point

[16:02] <timotimo> i do assume you already get downgrades in your search rank if you don't have https on?

[16:03] <FROGGS> likely

[16:09] <Zoffix> Google's been penalizing for a couple of years already and in Oct2017 they even made chrome cry that stuff' insecure when you enter any content on non-HTTPS site

[16:10] <Zoffix> jnthn: that's not the only reason to use HTTPS. A malicious attacker can inject "Download CroInstaller.exe" into the page fetched by the user, installing malware to them

[16:10] <timotimo> remember that fun instance where some bank site or something was complaining to a browser (was it firefox or chrome?) that it shows something about being insecure?

[16:10] <timotimo> and they firmly claimed their site is totally secure

[16:11] <timotimo> and shortly thereafter - because the bug report was public and surely passed around like an adorable kitty at a children's birthday party - someone hacked the 'site?

[16:11] <Zoffix> jnthn: this thing is easy to use and can hook you up with free SSL in like 2 minutes: https://certbot.eff.org/

[17:33] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: insert should return something, if you want to do that with insert.

[17:33] <Bowlslaw> jmerelo: how do i make it return an object?

[17:34] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: just do return. But you should maybe try and do that in a constructor. You can override the default constructor by using submethod new. 

[17:35] *** Zoffix joined
[17:35] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: also, you might want to take db and create-schema outside that class, since they are not working on self. They can be just average routines.

[17:35] <Bowlslaw> hmm

[17:35] <Zoffix> Bowlslaw: just put `self` at the end of insert method's body. Right now you're returning the return value of `say`, which is a `Bool` which is what the error is telling you

[17:35] <Bowlslaw> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[17:41] *** mahafyi_ joined
[17:42] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: Well, they are, but they are not actually working on any instance variable. You could change line 23 to just create-schema() and it would work the same, if you also take $!db outside the class. Bear in mind that, in this way, the db handle is going to be an attribute of a particular object. You probably don't want that...

[17:42] *** mahafyi left
[17:42] *** mahafyi_ is now known as mahafyi

[17:42] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: or from another point of view, you will have a database handle in every Item object. It's better if you either create a Singleton class to hold that, or simply a global variable.

[17:43] <Bowlslaw> ahh

[17:44] <Zoffix> m: sub trait_mod:<is>(Method:D \meth, :$fluent!) { meth.wrap: method (|c) { callsame |c; self } }; class Foo { method a is fluent { say "a" }; method b is fluent { say "b" } }.new.a.b.a.b.a.b

[17:58] *** cpage_ joined
[17:58] <Bowlslaw> so all I have to do is expand upon this foundation to implement the other functionality!

[17:58] <Bowlslaw> i admit i was quite hesitant to adopt perl 6...

[17:58] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: congrats :-)

[17:58] <Bowlslaw> i'm enjoying it now for some reason ;p

[17:59] <Bowlslaw> it's like a holy child of Haskell, Perl 5, and Scala

[17:59] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: happy to hear that. To tell you the truth, Haskell and Scala are a bit over the top for me. And the community here is much more welcoming :-)

[18:00] *** cpage left
[18:00] *** cpage_ is now known as cpage

[18:01] <Bowlslaw> yeah, not a fan of Scala, but I think Haskell is quite cool, and their community is super friendly and helpful

[18:02] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: and smart on top of that. I guess that coming from Perl I found the Perl 6 community easiest. And I still find Haskell a bit difficult to follow. Still, mightily powerful.

[18:02] <Bowlslaw> perl is a lot more useful, in general, than Haskell is, but Haskell really excels at mathematical modeling

[18:03] <Bowlslaw> if you are curious about Haskell, I highly recommend this book: https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1522346584&sr=1-2&keywords=haskell&dpID=41MyvljUPQL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch

[18:03] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: you will find that most of the things that make Haskell good at maths are also in Perl 6. First compiler, by Audrey Tang, called PUGs, was written in Haskell.

[18:03] <jmerelo> Bowlslaw: Thanks. I'll check it out.

[20:25] <masak> as long as $g is in scope for the `where`, it's fine for it to change during its lifetime

[20:25] <masak> whether it's _sane_ for a type to change dynamically like that is another discussion :)

[20:25] <masak> lichtkind: yes, I think also on private attributes

[20:26] <vcv> It appears you might have to put it in a block explicitly?

[20:26] <lichtkind> thanks so much and i think it is sane i do the matrix lib and i want types for basice range check or column and row indeces

[20:26] *** zakharyas left

[21:41] <Bowlslaw> I hope Perl 6 fixes Perl 5 biggest weakness: lack of GUI ;p

[21:41] <Bowlslaw> needs screenshots

[22:14] <Bowlslaw> Zoffix: DO you know how one would take the sum of all values of all rows in SQLite?

[22:15] <Bowlslaw> for example, this code gives me the total number of elements, instead of the sum of the values:

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> heh, nice use of emoji: https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs/blob/master/README.md#contents

[22:16] <Bowlslaw> my $sth = $dbh.prepare('select price from $table'); $sth.execute; my $total = $sth.allrows; say $total.sum;

[22:40] <Bowlslaw> yes

[22:41] <Bowlslaw> haha i'm likin my simple app so far

[22:41] <Bowlslaw> it accepts items into tables and then can sum up their total prices, select by date, description, etc

[22:42] <Bowlslaw> now I just need to make some graphs and a nice GUI >_>

[22:45] <titsuki_> bisectable: say log(3/4 * (3/7) ** 3 * 1/14 * 1/14) == log(3/4) + 3 * log(3/7) + log(1/14) + log(1/14)

[22:45] <bisectable6> titsuki_, On both starting points (old=2015.12 new=7572983) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[22:45] <bisectable6> titsuki_, Output on both points: «False␤»

[23:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7572983a4: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[23:01] <Zoffix> titsuki_: log is gives a Num, which is floating point math

[23:03] *** pharv left
[23:03] <Zoffix> .tell Bowlslaw well, first `$dbh.prepare("select price from $table")` is an unsafe statement. You need to quote $table properly. I don't use DBIish, but there should be some method to quote stuff (placeholders might work too). As for the sum, `my $total = $sth.allrows».head.sum`

[23:03] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to Bowlslaw.

[23:04] <Zoffix> c: 2018.03,HEAD say [log(3/4 * (3/7) ** 3 * 1/14 * 1/14), log(3/4) + 3 * log(3/7) + log(1/14) + log(1/14)]

[23:04] <committable6> Zoffix, ¦2018.03: «[-8.10769031284391 -8.10769031284391]␤» ¦HEAD(7572983): «[-8.107690312843909 -8.10769031284391]␤»

[23:05] <Zoffix> And on HEAD Num stringification is fixed ^ and you can see those are slightly different numbers.

[23:08] <titsuki_> so should I use "is-approx" even if they are equivalent in mathematically?

[23:08] <Zoffix> Yeah

[23:08] <titsuki_> Zoffix: OK, I see. Thanks!
