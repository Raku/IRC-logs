[00:54] <Xliff> geekosaur: Naw. The whole $/ is copy thing when using Action classes.

[00:55] <geekosaur> might be a trap

[00:55] <Xliff> LOL

[00:55] <Xliff> If you do further ad-hoc matching on $/, it won't work because that match wants to set $/, which is now read only.

[00:55] <Xliff> And throws an exception and BEWM!

[00:56] <Xliff> You're wondering WTF the assignment to a readonly object is where there is no "=" involved.

[00:56] <geekosaur> https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps#Using_regexes_within_grammar's_actions

[00:57] <Xliff> Well, feh!

[04:23] <holyghost> ^-- I have a NESMusicAgent with a message such as "rip roms", which method searches for sound enable in a NES ROM file

[04:24] <holyghost> Now I have to search for sound loops later on

[04:24] <holyghost> There's also M68000 processor hashmap of opcodes which you can use to let your agent assemble something

[04:40] <holyghost> Now I'll stop with the rom ripping code as further work on it is illegal. I am going to invent something like a parser for several agent types (e.g. youtube links, FB poster, the methods are legion

[05:13] <holyghost> I am going to make a system inside an agent which recognizes your (headerless) binary, I can use machine learning or hidden markov models for it

[05:14] <holyghost> So you know what you can do with a binary, some sort of linux "file" command but with searches of opcodes on a binary

[05:14] <holyghost> then classify etc

[05:15] <holyghost> It's also a method to salvage binaries if you like

[05:39] <Xliff> How can I force a shared resource through only one thread?

[05:41] <jmerelo> Xliff: what do you mean by force?

[05:42] <Xliff> I just want to make sure that when I erase a shared resource, I can do it where no other thread can add to it.

[05:42] <Xliff> Kinda like a blocking call.

[05:43] <holyghost> a virtual pointer ?

[05:43] <Xliff> No

[05:43] <holyghost> reference-counted pointer I mean

[05:43] <Xliff> NO

[05:44] <Xliff> synchronized { %empty-this-hash = {}; # No other thread can access %empty-this-hash until the block ends. }

[05:44] <holyghost> you can then use a mutex to lock everything since it's only one thread

[05:44] <Xliff> OK. I will look that up.

[11:01] <atroxaper> As I see, the signature is the same after wrapping the sub. But ACCEPTS works differently. Why? Moreover, signatures has the same WHICH...

[11:05] <jmerelo> atroxaper: well. Thing is, one thing is the signature of the container, other the signature of the thing contained

[11:19] *** zakharyas left
[11:20] <jmerelo> atroxaper: the problem is that by wrapping you are blending in a role which acts like a block. You are not actually modifying the signature. I don't know what's the deal with ~~ and/or ACCEPTS 

[11:21] <jmerelo> atroxaper: really, beats me. You can try and ask in StackOverflow, where there are people much more knowledgeable than me; question and answer will help the rest of the community

[17:08] <Zoffix> A Capture. 

[17:09] <Zoffix> jkramer: what difference is there between ("lol", "test", :foo(123)) and ("lol", :foo(123), "test") ?

[17:09] <jkramer> Zoffix: I want to print them in the order the user gave em to the sub :)

[17:10] <jkramer> I'm making a log module with the obvious methods debug, warn, info etc and want to pass the args on to a generic log method which then formats and prints them

[17:11] <jkramer> Would be weird if $log.debug("Here's a pair:", :foo(123), " and here's a number:", 123) would print the stuff in random order :)

[17:13] <jkramer> I guess I could use a slurpy array and pass it around but I thought this is exactly what captures are made for

[17:14] <Zoffix> But slurpy array wouldn't capture any positionals...

[17:14] <Zoffix> Captures were made for capturing the arguments, but named arguments aren't ordered.

[17:15] <leont> Yeah, been bitten by that before, solved that by reordering them in a way that made sense in my case, that approach may not be workable for all situations

[18:22] <El_Che> Kudos, Garland_g[m] 

[18:23] <El_Che> the only thing with the -c is that most of the time ot's delivered disabled, because it does run code, maybe external

[18:24] <El_Che> that's the case with syntastic

[18:26] <TimToady> Zoffix: just a heads up wrt the alias, which I'm thinking of as "It's the stage name (but Perl 6 still cashes the checks)"; at the moment I'm liking Raku the best for a short name (it's 4 letters like Enya or Pink or Gaga), with long names of either Raku-go or Go-raku (where "go" is Japanese 語 for "language") because I'm not terribly fond of the "-lang" neologism

[18:27] <TimToady> Ofun is a close second, but unfortunately "fun" is Japanese for excrement :)

[18:29] <TimToady> also Raku pottery is "imperfect but sophisticated", so that's a fit :)

[18:30] <TimToady> most of the existing uses of "raku" in trademarks appears to be for medical supplies or food processing

[18:31] <TimToady> and there doesn't seem to be an existing "raku" command, at least that Linux Mint knows about

[18:36] <Zoffix> haukex: you're in good company then. Because we don't call shots on Perl 5.28 either :P

[18:36] <TimToady> oh, also, it can be read as "rock you" :)

[18:36] <Zoffix> :D

[18:36] <TimToady> as in we-will-we-will

[18:37] <haukex> heh

[18:37] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v noganex

[18:38] <TimToady> though, to be honest, rakkyuu in Japanese means to fumble the ball :)

[18:39] <haukex> Zoffix: I meant in general, for any 5.x where x>6 (btw, I'm perfectly happy with Perl 5 staying Perl 5, it's just I've read others complaints)

[18:40] <Zoffix> haukex: that's what they should do, but that'd hurt Perl 6, so I hope they won't :P

[18:40] *** noganex_ joined

[18:42] <haukex> Zoffix: hm, I see your point... my idea was of the "*try* to make everyone happy" sort :-) Raku 6.d = Perl 6.d, Perl '30 = Perl 5.30

[18:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v noganex

[18:43] <Zoffix> haukex: where does that place perl11 then? :)

[18:44] <TimToady> .oO(Her long name is "Raku Roku Rock-U" so the 6 is permanent...)

[18:44] <haukex> Emojis I guess? ;-) the next Unicode version is adding an onion

[18:45] <Zoffix> u: butterfly

[18:45] <unicodable6> Zoffix, U+1F98B BUTTERFLY [So] (🦋)

[18:45] <Zoffix> It's even listed on Unicode sponsored chars page as dedicated to Perl 6 :)

[18:45] <TimToady> if it's invoked as "raku" I'm pretty sure we can assume we're dealing with p6 numbering

[18:46] *** Zoffix left
[18:47] <TimToady> anyway, "it's the stage name for Perl 6" seems like about the right level of cultural hack to me

[18:49] *** jmerelo left
[18:50] <haukex> Zoffix: nice, in your name too :-)

[18:51] <haukex> TimToady: +1 

[18:52] <TimToady> We invented the dual licensing, so why not dual naming too?

[18:53] <TimToady> ss/the //

[18:53] <haukex> I think some people will still want to interpret it as a "rename", but I liked your statement at last year's YAPC about Perl being a culture

[18:55] <TimToady> if people need to think of it that way, they may, but there's to be no stigmatizing of people who feel differently

[18:56] <TimToady> it's an 'any' junction, not a 'one' junction

[18:59] <haukex> I agree... if someone wants to think of it as a "rename" to feel better about it, that's probably a good thing :-)

[18:59] <TimToady> that being said, sometimes in context "Enya" communicates better than "Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin" :)

[19:00] <haukex> I stayed out of the whole 5 "versus" 6 thing, which is probably why I can't wrap my head around why some people have such strong feelings about it, but I've been reading a bit more about it recently.

[19:01] <haukex> anyway, I'm just happy that both 5 and 6 are great langauges :-)

[19:02] <haukex> IIRC Enya (the artist's) music was used in a Beck's (beer) commercial... that's the first association that comes to me ;-)

[19:05] <El_Che> TimToady: you don't cease to amaze me :)

[19:05] <El_Che> raku is the best, adding Go as a pre- or postfix may cause other confusions :)

[19:07] <Garland_g[m]> El_Che:To clarify, the linter is disabled by default because of code execution.

[19:08] <TimToady> El_Che: if we really wanted to confuse people we'd call it raku-golang :)

[19:09] <El_Che> Garland_g[m]: yes, exactly. It's choosing between an anoyence and a security risk when you randomely open perl6 code from the internet :)

[19:09] <ryn1x> Raku and Raku-go both sound real nice. Go-Raku does not flow as well IMHO. Raku 6.d looks nice too, but in this case is the 6 part of the name or version number...

[19:09] <SmokeMachine> I like Ofun...

[19:09] *** haukex left
[19:10] *** haukex joined
[19:10] <TimToady> SmokeMachine: so do I, in fact that's the one I was considering a couple weeks ago when one of my friends mentioned I'd asked about it

[19:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v haukex

[19:11] <TimToady> but in the end Raku is a better stage name

[19:11] <El_Che> ofun is more a inside-crowd reference which is nice, but it lack the strong pronunciation of raku

[19:12] <El_Che> on the other hand how do you pronounce the u in this case

[19:13] <El_Che> /uː/ or /ʊ/

[19:13] <SmokeMachine> Is the r of raku with the Japanese sound of r?

[19:13] <TimToady> well, Japanese doesn't have an "uh"

[19:14] <El_Che> https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/raku

[19:14] <TimToady> if you want to pronounce it "laku" in Japan, I doubt anyone will bat an eyelash

[19:14] <SmokeMachine> Easy?!

[19:14] <El_Che> the japanese r sounds like a h

[19:14] <TimToady> yes, it means "easy" or "comfort"

[19:14] <El_Che> 楽

[19:15] <TimToady> and yes, I made sure it wasn't the character used in "comfort women"

[19:15] <El_Che> it's a *very* nice character for posters

[19:15] <TimToady> well, it's essentially the same as the traditional Han character for music

[19:15] <El_Che> and it looks like a butterfly look at it funy

[19:16] <SmokeMachine> I’m asking that because in portugues there’s a difference between the sound of rr and r...

[19:16] <TimToady> 樂

[19:16] <El_Che> that a butterfly doing the rock and roll hand sign

[19:17] <SmokeMachine> The r sound does not exists in the beginning of the word in Portuguese... so every time I say Rakudo to some one the feels strange...

[19:18] <TimToady> らく also looks a bit like a butterfly

[19:18] <SmokeMachine> But I like raku too

[19:18] <El_Che> 楽: music; comfort, enjoyment; ease, simplicity; final day of a performance

[19:18] <El_Che> I like all the translations

[19:18] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:18] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: just say Haku

[19:19] <El_Che> like Hio de Janeirho

[19:19] <TimToady> well, it can also mean things like "drop", hence "fumble" or "fail"

[19:19] <El_Che> :)

[19:19] <TimToady> there is much space for punning the name in Japanese :)

[19:19] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: r in the beginning of the word sounds like rr...

[19:19] <El_Che> TimToady: it's applicable to you as a Japanese student

[19:20] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: it sounded more like a strong H to me when I was in Brazil

[19:20] <TimToady> of course, the fact that it's a back-formation from rakudo helps too

[19:20] <El_Che> haven't been to portugal though

[19:21] <El_Che> TimToady: I am looking at translation in other languages just to be sure

[19:21] <TimToady> it might also justify a better backronym for Moar

[19:21] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: the sound of r on rio is different of the r in janeiro

[19:22] <TimToady> El_Che: it's mostly just place names

[19:22] <El_Che> in Estonian is means "the cell" according to google, maybe AlexDaniel` can tell us more

[19:22] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: true

[19:22] <El_Che> omg

[19:22] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: I’m Brazilian

[19:22] <TimToady> it's also an odd verb form for some not-positive things in certain slavic languages, I think

[19:23] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: yes, I suspected so :)

[19:23] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: I’m Brazilian

[19:23] <haukex> Armenian: raku = raccoon

[19:23] <El_Che> in Vietnamese I get cancer

[19:23] <TimToady> that too

[19:23] <TimToady> but all those were taken into consideration :)

[19:23] <El_Che> in Uzbek: I get raccoon

[19:23] <haukex> Bosnian: cancer

[19:23] <El_Che> I like that one

[19:24] <El_Che> Urdu: hold on

[19:24] <haukex> same for Croatian

[19:24] <El_Che> in Telugo it's a raghu :)

[19:25] <TimToady> I guess we'll have to rename the Tropic of Cancer now...

[19:25] <haukex> Hawaiian: rash

[19:25] <El_Che> also applicabl

[19:25] <El_Che> e

[19:25] <haukex> Indonesian: confess

[19:25] <timotimo> Krita (art program) also doesn't have the best name when you look at some language ...

[19:27] <El_Che> it difficult to find a short 4-letter name without some weird translation somewhere

[19:27] <El_Che> ofun in Yoruba means "one of them"

[19:28] <El_Che> in Urdu "faithful"

[19:28] <haukex> ok, that was most of the Google Translate languages

[19:28] <El_Che> (although without native speakers weighting in we don't know if the nice translation have conotations)

[19:29] <haukex> true, Google Translate can often be quite inaccurate

[19:30] <TimToady> well, it's not like we're trying to sell a car named "nova" :)

[19:30] <haukex> I like how when you click the audio button in google once, it says the word normally, and when you click it a second time it says it much slower ;-)

[19:44] <El_Che> haukex: google translate have a sarcastic mode :)

[19:45] <El_Che> "Meta Objects Arouse Raku" could be an option as well

[19:45] <haukex> "what, you didn't hear me the first time? okay, I'll say it reeeal slow" ;-) (but seriously, a useful feature)

[19:46] <lizmat> ,oO( Moar Objects Around Raku )

[19:46] <El_Che> that could work

[19:47] <lizmat> for that necessary bit of recursiveness

[19:47] <El_Che> Don't ask TimToady to pick an alias, he'll alias the lot :)

[19:47] <TimToady> Above, Adorn, I looked at most of the A words already :)

[19:48] <TimToady> Arm, Allow, etc

[19:48] <TimToady> I just thought "Amuse" fit better with the stagename vibe :)

[19:49] <El_Che> Amerce

[19:49] <TimToady> Arouse is perhaps NSFW

[19:50] <El_Che> yeah :)

[19:51] <El_Che> TimToady: on the other hand, wearing a "Roku" t-shirt at YAPC-JP may be a little tricky :)

[20:07] <SmokeMachine> so, is rakudo the way of raku?

[20:08] <El_Che> Wow

[20:08] <El_Che> good none

[20:08] <El_Che> good one

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> well, I'll take it, but to be honest I'm not sure why everyone is so happy about that particular one. Though I'm indeed happy that there's at least something coming

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> right off the bat couldn't figure out how to pronounce that R there, but maybe I'm the only one

[20:11] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: you can alias the pronounciation

[20:12] <El_Che> being an international buch, we'll always have that problem

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> and then there's also “long name” coming? Like if this name is not confusing by itself already

[20:12] <El_Che> (I propose the french pronounciation)

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> there's also… I don't know… something about it just doesn't ring to me as a name

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> but again, I'll take it if that is it

[20:15] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: what was your favorite

[20:16] <SmokeMachine> could someone who speak Japanese confirm if rakudo could be translated of "the way of raku", please? (im curious about that)

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I liked 6lang and ofun

[20:18] <AlexDaniel> there's just some catchiness about them that I like, that raku lacks IMO

[20:39] <Zoffix> SmokeMachine: no idea

[20:40] <El_Che> rakudo is translated as "comic" and "paradise" by google

[20:40] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: it's fine. Don't look a gifted horse in the teeth. It works well when combined with Perl 6 ("Raku Perl 6"). It fits with the compiler name and the already established Raku* name due to that compiler.

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> 🤷

[20:46] <El_Che> Zoffix: luckily there isn't a popular language called Go
