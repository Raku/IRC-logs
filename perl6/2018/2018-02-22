[00:56] <Xliff> timotimo: Still there?

[00:57] <timotimo> Xliff: yup

[00:58] <Xliff> Do you have a copy of rindolf's port of that euler problem to P6?

[00:58] <Xliff> The pastebin seems to have expired.

[00:58] <Xliff> How is that going, BTW?

[01:00] <timotimo> haven't been able to work on it any more since rindolf told me the numbers would fit into 64bit

[01:03] <timotimo> http://hack.p6c.org/~timo/rindolf_primes_thing.p6

[01:05] <timotimo> i reduced it to 2..19 so it would finish is ~7 seconds instead of the ~10 minutes i read in the backlog

[01:05] <timotimo> i also downloaded a primesieve x64 binary

[01:06] <timotimo> so i started writing the first report blog post for my grant and ... i'm really not good at this ...

[01:06] <timotimo> it's already past 1k words

[01:09] <Xliff> Ahhh.

[01:14] <Xliff> FWIW, mine runs in ~11, but I'm on a 32bit VM

[01:51] <Xliff> timotimo: Yes, seconds.

[01:52] <timotimo> i got it down to under 3 seconds just now

[01:52] <timotimo> i had to split the calculation in the hot loop, the one with the assign-pos and at-pos and such

[01:53] <timotimo> into three pieces that are all defined int

[01:54] <timotimo> somehow it's still allocating a crapton of int objects

[01:55] <timotimo> well, Int objects

[01:56] <timotimo> yet somehow there's much fewer GC runs and every gc run is almost half as long

[01:58] <timotimo> something's way off :)

[17:57] <jkramer> If there's a perl6 process running while upgrading rakudo, that process dumps core due to a "bus error"

[17:58] <mspo> AlexDaniel: I'll have to check it out.  I haven't done anything since 2017.08 or so

[17:58] <mspo> AlexDaniel: where the filenames for modules were based on things like build timestamp :)

[17:59] <AlexDaniel> mspo: well, there's this issue: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/117

[18:00] <mspo> yeah all related

[18:00] <AlexDaniel> jkramer: I've never seen a ticket for this, although I've known about this issue for a long time (in fact I abused it to restart the bots). So maybe you can file a ticket?

[18:03] <jkramer> AlexDaniel: Do you think it's worth it? :) I was just curious about why this happens as I assumed everything's in memory already, but I wouldn't consider this a bug

[18:04] <AlexDaniel> jkramer: if it's not a bug we'll have a properly written explanation in the rejected ticket. I think it's worth it

[18:05] *** [Sno] left
[18:05] <jkramer> Ok then :)

[18:06] <El_Che> sounds like it seriously breaks the least surprise principle, at least

[18:12] * [Coke] has a bunch of stickers from a conference called "rise of the bots", feel like I should ship that all to AlexDaniel++ :)

[21:13] <DrForr> Figured out the issue with the CommonMark module, will hopefully release it this week.

[21:13] <DrForr> (github.com/commonmark/cmark)

[21:14] <DrForr> Also, if the person who I was talking about rebuilding Markdown is around, ^^^

[21:26] <dylanwh> DrForr: I'm working on binding github's markdown for perl5.

[21:27] <sjn> something like http://search.cpan.org/~minimal/Pod-Markdown-Github/ ?

[21:28] <dylanwh> sjn: no, https://github.com/github/cmark/

[21:29] <sjn> aah

[21:29] <dylanwh> my users desire 100% github compatibility :)

[21:33] *** cdg joined
[21:35] <DrForr> Heh. I think it's the same library, but let me take a look.

[21:37] <DrForr> Almost exactly the same, they appear to have added a generic linked-list on top of cmark...

[21:37] <DrForr> I can throw what I have onto github right now if you need a basis to work from - I've just finishe cmark_node_* calls.

[21:38] *** cdg left
[21:38] <DrForr> Eeh, let me do that anyway.

[21:43] <DrForr> Done, look at https://github.com/drforr/perl6-CommonMark

[21:45] <DrForr> You can do CommonMark.to-html('*commonmark* text'); # and get UTF-8 HTML back, and it also apparently (passes the tests, anyway) handles the CommonMark node with a somewhat-useful wraper class.

[21:48] <dylanwh> yeah, I'm already basing it on that

[21:49] <dylanwh> figuring out when I need to allocate the linked list of extensions is the hardest part

[21:51] <DrForr> Oh, I put that up up last week, right :/ Senioritis...

[21:51] <DrForr> Right, I put it up from a different VM.

[21:52] <DrForr> Well, what I've got up there covers the base and ::Node, I'm putting up ::Iterator here in a few minutes.
