[10:50] <jast> "Something went wrong, code -1"

[10:52] <moritz> "Cannot read /etc/foo" vs "Cannot read /etc/foo: Permission Denied"

[10:53] <moritz> this level, for example

[10:53] <jast> "This shouldn't happen"

[10:54] *** cdg joined
[10:54] <jast> let's not make it too straightforward... "Cannot read file: Address already in use"

[10:55] <masak> I once read a thing about an FTP client that had the worst error message ever, where not knowing the terminology would make the user *horrified*

[10:55] <masak> the error was something like: "Error when running process: child killed"

[10:56] <jast> you mean like git's messages about detached HEAD? :)

[10:56] <masak> the "detached HEAD" thing always makes me think of Nearly Headless Nick in Harry Potter

[10:57] <masak> I do wonder whether, had it had a much milder term, the very verbose message would also have have been less panicky

[10:58] <jast> that's semi-detached you seem to be thinking about

[10:58] <jast> git semi-detach --hinge HEAD

[10:58] *** cdg left
[10:59] <masak> :)

[11:00] <masak> recently I've come to think of Git branches as laundry labels, and HEAD as the pointy-bubbly you-are-here symbol from Google Maps

[11:10] <jast> they're more like post-its... easy to move

[13:53] <moritz> masak: speaking of fast-and-loose thinking, there's a nice way to solve differential equations

[13:54] <moritz> say, dy/dx = x

[13:54] <moritz> as somebody who studied physics, I'm allowed to tear apart the differentials

[13:54] <moritz> and have dy = x dx

[13:54] <moritz> and then I slap an integral sign on both sides, and I'm good

[13:54] <timotimo> i remember that

[13:55] <moritz> mathemticians have... qualms with that method

[13:56] <masak> moritz: there's half a dozen of "rules of thumb" like that, where doing the obvious thing with differentials actually works and has good rationales behind it

[13:56] <masak> moritz: I think the reason there's even hesitation around that (and the reason you mention qualms) is that infinitesimals were at one point shown not to be rigorous in some ways

[13:57] <masak> but -- and I'm not able to back this up with proof -- they are often rigorous enough for the rules of thumb to work

[13:59] <moritz> masak: a prof I asked about this said there that you needed to proof certain properties of the solution function first to separate the differentials

[13:59] *** wamba joined

[19:34] <novalinium> I'm trying to use slurp on a captured output pipe from run, and I'm getting "Invocant of method 'slurp' must be an object instance of type 'IO::Handle', not a type object of type 'IO::Pipe'." I thought that IO::Pipe inherits from IO::Handle?

[19:35] <timotimo> novalinium: it probably does, but you've got a type object there, not an instance

[19:37] <novalinium> Can you point me at documentation for the difference? Minimal example of my syntax at http://ix.io/DON

[19:38] *** Ven`` left
[19:38] <timotimo> well, you're trying to call slurp on an undefined object

[23:10] <Zoffix> lizmat++ good weekly

[23:11] <ennio> good evening perl6!

[23:12] <Zoffix> lizmat: some errata, if you wish to make corrections: "which also include a check on definedness" I don't think I added that; I made Int:D(...) coercers parse as coercers (they used to parse as just smileys).

[23:12] <AlexDaniel> c: HEAD https://gist.githubusercontent.com/COMBORICO/dc9d458e524060763519d0a1e45fcfa1/raw/2336a580815cd2cb9dc17e146f8cffab00c7d9d1/gistfile1.txt

[23:12] <committable6> AlexDaniel, Successfully fetched the code from the provided URL.

[23:12] <Zoffix> lizmat: and Jeremy Studer made negated chained operators work correctly. They used to give different results. The perf was actually lost and will need to be remade again

[23:13] <ennio> quick info: I just published a perl6 language extension for visual studio code

[23:13] <ennio> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scriplit.perl6-lsp

[23:14] <Zoffix> Well, the coercers have a check on definedness sometimes, but it's kinda broken 'cause the code used just uses the general knob for definedness

[23:27] <Zoffix> That was ridiculous. Just clicked random things for 2nd 3rd of the survey. I imagine I'm not the only one and their data is biased.

[23:28] <gfldex> that's why it is called a "survey"

[23:29] <Zoffix> Travis chimed in on our rakudo linux failures; tho so far only asked if we're still experiencing them: https://twitter.com/travisci/status/950463103464067073
