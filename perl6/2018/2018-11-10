[00:36] <timotimo> :)

[00:36] <timotimo> i'm thinking i should probably record a screencast or something detailing exactly how to install and run all of this

[00:37] <timotimo> until the frontend gains some automatic "run this code and profile it and load the profile" button

[00:59] <MasterDuke> timotimo: package it as a docker container/appimage/snap/flatpack?

[00:59] <timotimo> i looked into appimage. it was a little bit No

[01:00] <timotimo> i'll probably go for docker, that ought to be a bit easier

[01:00] <timotimo> though i'm not entirely sure how to easily make the system-wide perl6 installation available to be used from inside the docker container without building some hacky RPC

[01:01] <timotimo> basically a container-escape exploit, but on purpose

[01:09] <MasterDuke> not include perl6 in the container?

[01:12] <timotimo> it has to be in there for the cro app to run

[01:13] <MasterDuke> then why do you need access to the system perl6?

[01:21] <timotimo> well, the user wants to benchmark their code, right?

[01:21] <timotimo> they probably have some libraries they want to use

[01:23] <woolfy> timotimo++   I hope you get the attention it deserves.  I posted it also on Perl6 facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/perl6/permalink/2221859944747019/

[02:58] <Xliff> Yeah, I'll do that when it's done.

[02:59] <holyghost> thanks

[02:59] <holyghost> really appreciate it

[17:51] <timotimo> you don't have to, no :)

[19:47] <sena_kun> Xliff, I am sorry, but I am not sure why I am being casted in this case.

[19:49] <Xliff> sena_kun: Sorry. I thought you knew a little about NativeCall.

[19:49] <sena_kun> ah, no problem then, but no, I think I am not. :)

[20:06] <timotimo> anything erroneous, when you get an RST?

[20:07] <timotimo> Xliff: do you ever have to introspect the types involved? what happens if you turn them all into Pointer?

[20:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v delon

[20:08] <timotimo> for example, if your GValue is somehow not the right size, it could make init_value and friends write into unowned memory

[20:08] <timotimo> you could compare "nativesizeof GValue" with what you get from sizeof(GValue) in gdb

[20:12] <Xliff> Yes. It's 24 bytes across the board.

[20:12] <Xliff> I think I talk about that in the second link.

[20:15] <jnthn> I'm probably way to full of cold to think about anything difficult :)

[20:15] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cydf

[20:16] <Xliff> Heh! No worries. 

[20:16] <jnthn> I wonder if it's relevant that CArray, when allocated from the Perl 6 program, allocates memory up to the size of the last assigned element

[20:16] <timotimo> have you valground it yet?

[20:16] <jnthn> And that also it caches the Perl 6 values

[20:17] <jnthn> So if it's some kind of out-dated data problem then there's some native refresh thingy that is sometimes needed.

[20:17] <jnthn> I forget the details.

[20:17] <Xliff> timotimo: No. No valgrinding, yet.

[20:17] <jnthn> And yeah, what timotimo said; valgrind can do wonders in explaining memory problems.

[20:18] <Xliff> Excellent! Then that's a place to start. Thanks.

[20:42] <kensanata> Style question, cro related: I have $pw is cookie declared and to decode it. That means I can't use the same variable name. So: my $pw_decoded = uri_decode_component($pw || ''); Now I need to all a function and would love to use :$pw but no, I need to use pw => $pw_decoded. What am I doing wrong? What I really want to do is $pw = uri_decode_component($pw || '') and then use :$pw.

[20:46] <sena_kun> well, I am not sure you can avoid that. If you mean something like "I want to tell Cro to apply this decoder to this cookie, so do it for me", we don't have anything like that. And it is, in fact, more of user side of things, imho. So I'd do it with `pw => $pw-decoded`, as it relates to application logic, not http processing.

[20:46] <sena_kun> kensanata, ^

[20:49] <sena_kun> if you have, like, 10 such cookies per route and it makes the code look worse, I'd factor this decoding & response setting piece out into a subroutine, but no more.

[20:49] <kensanata> Well, I guess I could frame it as a general case: perl6 offers the shortcut :$foo, but disallows the changing of functino arguments, forcing me to write ugly code for every function that has an argument $foo, has to do something to the value and wants to pass it along to the next one, still calling it $foo.

[20:53] <sena_kun> kensanata, can you try with `is rw` applied to cookie parameter? I suspect it might be a bad thing in Cro case, but as in general case, it might help.

[20:54] <kensanata> sena_kun: interesting proposition. I thought that only applied to classes and attributes...

[20:55] <sena_kun> ahh

[20:55] <sena_kun> nope, I am wrong.

[20:56] <sena_kun> well, then I don't know. And, probably, don't even consider the code you worry about as _too_ ugly to worry about. 

[20:57] <sena_kun> s/you worry about/you write/

[20:57] <kensanata> Both! :D

[20:57] <sena_kun> well, without `:g`, only first one, or at least I remember it being so. :)

[20:58] <timotimo> you probably don't want rw, you'll want copy instead

[20:58] <timotimo> m: sub bar(:$foo is copy) { $foo.say }; bar(99)

[20:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 307a98bdb: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 0 arguments but got 1␤  in sub bar at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:58] <timotimo> m: sub bar(:$foo is copy) { $foo.say }; bar(foo => 99)

[20:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 307a98bdb: OUTPUT: «99␤»

[20:58] <timotimo> "is copy" works with optional parameter

[20:58] <sena_kun> m: sub bar(:$foo) { $foo.say }; sub foo(:$foo is copy) { $foo = $foo + 10; bar(:$foo) }; foo(foo => 10);

[21:06] *** ryn1x left
[21:09] <jnthn> Probably `is copy` is cleanest, though an alternative is `:pw($pw-undec)` to decouple the named parameter name from the variable it's bound into

[21:10] <jnthn> You may also want to file a Cro feature request for a way to ask the router to do a certain decoding of cookies; we might be able to add such a feature at some point.

[21:12] <sena_kun> jnthn, with matching API for e.g. headers?

[22:10] <kensanata> I'm not sure what to suggest. I'm using URI::Encode because I'm encoding two or three strings. Is this rare? Common? Do people store complex data? Is base64 what they expect? I have no idea. So perhaps all I would ask is for an example in the documentation?
