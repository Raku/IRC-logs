[11:36] <Guest8963> is it possible to do `for 0..10 -> $y {for 0..10 -> $x{ #`{do stuff} } }` but in one for loop like `for 0..10 -> $x, $y { #`{do stuff} }` ?

[11:36] <Guest8963> nesting loops is a common pattern

[11:38] <Guest8963> like junctions

[11:42] <geekosaur> not like that, that syntax should grab pairs of numbers instead of single ones iirc. I don;t think there's a way to collapse multiple loops together currently

[15:50] <mr_ron> AlexDaniel - next squashathon is "testneeded" which describes many/most open roast issues.  Wondering if you think the "testneeded" tag I added there yesterday makes sense.

[15:51] *** rfordinal left
[15:52] <AlexDaniel> mr_ron: feel free to work on roast tickets, yes. squashable6 will track roast repo, so all changes there will be counted for the squashathon

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> mr_ron: in my opinion there are not many easy issues there

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> mr_ron: usually half-resolved rakudo tickets already come with short examples and right/wrong output, so it is fairly easy to write a test and close such issues

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> the stuff in https://github.com/perl6/roast/issues is more difficult, for me at least

[15:53] <AlexDaniel> but maybe there are some LHFs, feel free to mark them as such :)

[17:39] <Zoffix> .ask pmurias what does `say 8.737675311215749e+198` print on the JS backend? I can't get MoarVM's nqp::div_In to avoid drift and I'm coming to the conclusion that current approach of converting to doubles first ain't gonna cut it and we need to divide using big decimals. That's how JVM does it and it gives right answers.

[17:39] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to pmurias.

[17:39] <timotimo> greetings benjikun 

[17:40] <benjikun> Howdy

[17:42] <timotimo> what can i do for you?

[17:43] <benjikun> Nothing in particular, just wondering if you're still actively workin here

[17:43] <timotimo> oh, yes i am :)

[17:44] <timotimo> my laptop battery will only last about 30 more minutes :|

[17:44] <benjikun> good to hear :)

[17:44] <benjikun> What laptop is it?

[17:44] <timotimo> t440s

[17:44] <benjikun> I normally use cheap-ish thinkpads

[17:44] <benjikun> ah

[17:45] <tony-o> thinkpads are nice

[17:45] <timotimo> they really are

[17:45] <timotimo> i didn't get this one for cheap, though ;)

[17:45] <benjikun> I'm fairly happy working with older thinkpads

[17:45] <benjikun> the displays are a little dim, though

[17:45] *** Zoffix left
[17:45] <timotimo> my next thinkpad might be an older thinkpad (so maybe one that's new this year ;) )

[17:46] <timotimo> but this one will get a proper repair soon i think

[17:46] *** pierre_ joined
[17:46] <timotimo> i broke both the ram slot and the touchpad

[17:46] <benjikun> The T440s is fairly recent right?

[17:46] <timotimo> and i think i want to replace one of the batteries

[17:46] <timotimo> that's right

[17:47] <benjikun> I've swapped thinkpad parts a ton

[17:47] <benjikun> my laptops are frankenstein-tier

[17:47] <timotimo> :)

[17:47] <Bowlslaw> you know, if i were first learning to program, perl 6 would be horrible, but since i have decent experience, perl 6 seems quite cool

[17:47] <benjikun> Bowlslaw: What makes you think it's bad for a first?

[17:48] <timotimo> i think i got it around 2013.06

[17:48] <timotimo> so it's really not old yet

[17:49] <timotimo> i think it was the latest generation at that point

[17:49] <benjikun> timotimo: Where'd you learn the low-level knowledge necessary to work on MoarVM?

[17:50] <benjikun> Are there any good books you'd recommend for the virtual machine barebones buildup stuff?

[17:50] *** pierre_ left
[17:50] <timotimo> actually C++ was somewhat early in my programming carreer

[17:50] <timotimo> so i was capable enough at C to get started

[17:51] <timotimo> i had my fingers in parrot for a little bit before moarvm arrived

[17:51] <benjikun> I have a basic understanding of C/C++

[17:51] <benjikun> is parrot still ongoing?

[17:51] <timotimo> but most of it was asking the other moar devs

[17:51] <timotimo> the last release was in 2016, i believe. we don't maintain rakudo-on-parrot any more

[17:52] <benjikun> hm

[17:52] <Bowlslaw> benjikun: Well, it's a very complicated language, the syntax is not intuitive, and tim toady

[17:52] <Bowlslaw> if I were first learning, I would probably be rather confused without strict guidance

[17:53] <timotimo> the concept of "baby perl" exists

[17:53] <timotimo> my food is here

[17:53] <benjikun> Tim toady is a double-edged sword in my opinion

[17:53] <Bowlslaw> it's true, but I do believe it makes things more difficult initially, but marvelous in the longer run

[17:54] <timotimo> shutting down my laptop now o/

[17:54] <Bowlslaw> \o

[17:54] <benjikun> timotimo: Enjoy your food friend o/

[17:54] <Bowlslaw> \o/

[17:54] <benjikun> What would you recommend a child to start with as a first programming language Bowlslaw?

[17:55] <benjikun> I didn't really start with a specific language

[17:55] <benjikun> I jumped languages in the beginning, probably more to my dedriment

[17:56] *** Guest94130 is now known as kaare_

[17:56] <benjikun> *detriment

[18:01] <Bowlslaw> benjikun: a child?

[18:01] <Bowlslaw> like a 10 year old?

[18:01] <benjikun> Bowlslaw: Or anyone starting to program

[18:01] <Bowlslaw> C XD

[18:01] <benjikun> I suppose those recommendations would vary lmao

[18:01] <Bowlslaw> it depends on their end goal IMO

[18:01] <benjikun> Fair enough

[18:02] <Bowlslaw> if they really want to learn about computers and programming, I say C

[18:02] <benjikun> To be honest, I don't think it's a terrible idea for a newcomer to start with C

[18:02] <Bowlslaw> I learned with K&R C and vim lol, it was sooo hard

[18:03] <benjikun> Bowlslaw: I did the same

[18:03] <Bowlslaw> but with C, what do you learn, in addition to basic programming concepts?

[18:03] <benjikun> alongside a friend who knew it

[18:03] <Bowlslaw> you learn how memory works

[18:03] <benjikun> True, learning the fundamentals really impact your view on programming as a whole

[18:04] <benjikun> I'd say in a good way

[18:04] <Bowlslaw> on the other hand, if their end goal isn't to be as much of a computer scientist or dev, and more to use a programming language as a tool to complement your primary discipline, perhaps python would be better

[18:04] <Bowlslaw> it's simple, one way to do things

[18:05] <Bowlslaw> I personally dislike it for those very reasons, but for someone who isn't interested in the deeper aspects and just needs pure git-er-done'ness...

[18:05] <benjikun> What's your GitHub?

[18:05] <Bowlslaw> tiny learning curve

[18:05] <Bowlslaw> https://github.com/Bowlslaw

[18:05] <Bowlslaw> haha it's a mess right now

[18:06] <benjikun> no worries

[18:06] <Bowlslaw> i haven't added any of my real projects to it yet

[18:06] <benjikun> It's the same way for me

[18:06] <benjikun> A year or so ago, I decided to ditch github and deleted my account

[18:06] <benjikun> and then I decided to come back lol

[18:07] <benjikun> I hosted my own git server w/ a cgit web interface

[18:10] <Bowlslaw> cool

[18:20] <mst> gogs is interesting for self hosting

[18:20] <benjikun> Never used it

[18:20] <benjikun> I checked out Go early on and haven't checked in since

[18:20] <tony-o> jnthn: orm stuff is starting to come together https://gist.github.com/tony-o/d63648c0271857baa5b68e5f2aa411f0

[18:24] <mst> tony-o: note that I have always regretted having set_column and friends be public

[18:24] <tony-o> what would you change about it?

[18:24] <tony-o> or, what headaches has it caused?

[18:25] *** darutoko left
[18:25] <mst> mostly that accessors end up getting bypassed so, basically, somebody wraps an accessor (or converts it into a method because the column's been renamed or split or whatever)

[18:26] <mst> and then people using set_column directly poke past that into the object internals and everything goes horribad

[18:27] <tony-o> ah, hmm

[18:27] <tony-o> i can see where that might turn into some kind of nightmare trying to determine if it's wrapped (how many times), overridden etc

[18:28] <El_Che> mst: here is your chance for seconds-system done right!

[18:33] *** Guest18_ joined
[18:33] *** FROGGS joined
[18:33] <mst> personally I'm leaning more towards having a relational metaprogramming tool

[18:33] <mst> and then bolting orthogonal persistence on top

[18:34] <moritz> I must say that I quite enjoy working with sqlalchemy

[18:35] <moritz> the disadvantage is mainly that it's quite big, and has a huge API surface

[18:36] <tony-o> mst: i saw a proposal/spec? that you wrote a while ago (3 or so years ago now?, possibly more) for making sql more object-y, trying to recall what it was called.  more of that style?

[18:38] <mst> tony-o: I think that might've been Data::Query but I wasn't entirely happy with that

[18:40] <tony-o> the syntax or just the structure in general?

[18:41] *** khw left
[18:42] * mspo goes to look up "orthogonal persistence"

[18:42] <mst> mspo: I may have invented that phrase. I don't remember.

[18:42] <mst> what I mean is "the object itself doesn't have to know it's database backed"

[18:42] *** pecastro joined
[18:43] <tony-o> ah

[18:43] <mspo> mst: google has a lot of results for it

[18:43] <mspo> even a wikipedia

[18:43] <mst> oh good

[18:43] <mspo> "Persistence is said to be "orthogonal" or "transparent" when it is implemented as an intrinsic property of the execution environment of a program. An orthogonal persistence environment does not require any specific actions by programs running in it to retrieve or save their state."

[18:44] <mspo> seem more like AUTOCOMMIT=1 :)

[18:44] <Bowlslaw> OOOO you're making an ORM for perl 6?

[18:44] <mst> mspo: no.

[18:45] <mspo> "Orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system."

[18:45] <mst> the important part is "only code that wants to care about the fact this is database backed should need to care"

[18:46] <mst> (which is another reason e.g. set_column was a stupid idea on my part, you end up with DBIC-specific code where there's no good reason)

[18:46] <mspo> oic

[18:47] <tony-o> does set_column do an auto update of the fields?

[18:47] <tony-o> in the db, i mean

[18:47] <mst> no

[18:48] *** dct joined
[18:48] <mspo> just normalizing prepared statement placeholders is a real chore :)

[18:49] <tony-o> it is rather messy

[22:42] <timotimo> holy wow. i was super annoyed by ctrlp being slow, but i chalked it up to something in the display parts being slow, because even when the list was narrowed down to just one entry it'd still take almost a second for each letter to be accepted

[22:42] <timotimo> turns out it's not narrowing down at all. just re-running the filter on the whole dataset every time you enter a new letter

[22:42] <timotimo> ctrlp-py-matcher is drastically slower and now ctrlp is pleasant to use

[23:15] <El_Che> any updates on github's perl6 recognision? This perl5 repo is wrongly marked as perl6: https://github.com/ology/Music-ScaleNote

[23:17] <MasterDuke> when i was writing a bunch of racket and clojure, i had tap left shift be '(' and tap right shift be ')'

[23:22] *** Zoffix joined
[23:22] <Zoffix> El_Che: the update is that issue has been resolved ages ago... 

[23:23] <Zoffix> El_Che: I mean, the GitHub Issue.

[23:24] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:25] <Zoffix> Prolly should add `use strictures` to this list: https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3880/files#diff-e56a8d50b1a75fc4212ffb3504faa007R85

[23:27] * Zoffix opens a new Issue

[23:28] *** mcmillhj left
[23:30] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: well I guess if the file used .pm6 extension there wouldn't be this issue

[23:30] <yoleaux> 22:16Z <titsuki_> AlexDaniel: thanks, It seems that this pull-one example should be more practical one (e.g., use until syntax and check if..pull-one hits IterationEnd or not): https://docs.perl6.org/routine/pull-one

[23:30] <AlexDaniel> not that it shouldn't be fixed

[23:30] *** ufobat joined
[23:31] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: the issue is the inverse. The code is Perl 5, was detected as Perl 6, before .gitattributes was added

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> ah oops
