[00:08] <Juerd> Why do rats stringify with a decimal point notation, and is there a method like .nude that will return a string that roundtrips with val(), i.e. 23/3 instead of ~.nude, which returns "23 3"?

[00:31] <AlexDaniel> it's basically just a print call, and someone is talking about write-only code O_o

[00:33] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: it's unacceptable that it's && and not "and" like in python which is a readable programming language because it looks like words

[00:38] <timotimo> at least C is a letter

[00:38] <timotimo> perl 6 has the audacity to have a *number* in its name

[00:49] <Kaiepi> huh, didn't know && and || had different priorities between perl and perl 6

[00:49] <lucs> Kaiepi: That's not what's happening.

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> “Perl 6 started as Larry throwing a coffee mug during a conference two decades ago”

[00:49] <Kaiepi> it's not?

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> haha…

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> Kaiepi: yeah, it's "0" that is truthy in one and is not in the other

[00:50] <Kaiepi> ohh

[00:50] <lucs> Kaiepi: In Perl 5, "0" evaluates to false, but in 6, to True (as for any string).

[00:50] <Kaiepi> guessing perl's the one where "0" is falsey

[00:50] <Kaiepi> yeah

[00:51] <timotimo> perl5 has the "0 but true" thing

[00:51] <Kaiepi> sounds like javascript

[00:51] <timotimo> which in perl6 it'd be "0" but false instead

[00:51] <lucs> It's a pretty nice example, showing where Perl 6 has cleaned up its act so to speak.

[00:51] <timotimo> it doesn't get to show up the new ternary

[00:52] <timotimo> though i've seen people see it for the first time and say "wtf why would you do that"

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> also doesn't demonstrate `say`

[00:52] <timotimo> so ... *shrug*

[00:52] <lucs> It doesn't show a lot of things :)

[00:52] <timotimo> why doesn't it do multithreading, huh?

[00:53] <AlexDaniel> ye, have to show off react block!

[00:54] <Kaiepi> odd question but how would i make it so &say calls &die instead?

[00:54] <Kaiepi> i know i've done it before but idr how

[00:54] <timotimo> m: my &say = &die; say "hello"

[00:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7e86d4e30: OUTPUT: «hello␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:54] <Kaiepi> oh

[00:54] <Juerd> AlexDaniel: Thanks for the answer, although .perl wasn't what I was looking for :)

[00:56] <MasterDuke> Juerd: ISTR a similar question recently (past month or so), was that also you?

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> m: my &say = &say ∘ &die; say ‘foo’

[00:57] <Juerd> MasterDuke: I don't know what ISTR means, but I don't recall having asked a similar question before.

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> this craptacular error message, *again*

[00:57] <MasterDuke> "i seem to recall"

[00:57] <AlexDaniel> though maybe it shouldn't work?

[00:58] <AlexDaniel> actually, that's probably the case when the error message is right :)

[00:59] <Kaiepi> m: (&say but role { method CALL-ME(Str $t) { die $t } })(1)

[05:37] <yoleaux> Xliff: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[05:38] <lookatme_q> Xliff, If you mean the method itself, I think it doesn't

[05:41] <Xliff> Well, I'm more concerned with what happens when I $s.emit and want the tapped code to return a value.

[05:41] <Xliff> If the tapped code returns a value, where does it go?

[05:41] <Xliff> That's not clear from the docs.

[05:41] <Xliff> And I understand that there is an issue if a Supply has multiple taps.

[05:42] <lookatme_q> The Tap is not have detail in document

[05:42] <Xliff> Yeah. I know. :(

[05:43] <Xliff> Thanks for the information, though.

[05:43] <lookatme_q> And what the issue is ?

[05:47] <Xliff> Take this code: sub setup_callback { my $s; my $callback = -> $arg1 --> uint32 { $s //= Supply.new; do_something_in_c(--> uint32 { $s.emit($arg1) }); $s }; setup_callback().tap(-> $arg1 --> uint32 { do_something($arg1) }); 

[05:48] <Xliff> I'd want the return value of the code in the tap to return to the C code via $s.emit

[05:48] *** jmerelo joined
[05:48] <Xliff> I thought that was possible, but now I think that is not. Mainly for the reason of multiple taps on a single Supply.

[05:49] *** fbynite left

[05:50] <Xliff> lookatme_q: I see. I am looking at the same choice.

[05:51] <Xliff> I have a version of this with supply and one without and the one without works.

[05:52] <lookatme_q> If you want the return value of tapped code, I think you should emit them such as `supply {  emit do_something($arg1) }`

[05:53] <lookatme_q> oh, may not work in tap :/

[05:54] <lookatme_q> But it's like you gave something to a Supply, and the code return another Supply of return value

[05:54] <lookatme_q> or return the value from another Supply

[05:54] <lookatme_q> I am not find another way to do it

[05:55] <lookatme_q> s/am/can/

[05:56] <lookatme_q> Xliff, Finally, I replace the Supply with some publish/subscribe code 

[05:56] <lookatme_q> And it works fine currently

[10:08] <ToddAndMargo> I used `$var[0..*]` before I knew the difference

[10:10] <jnthn> $var[] is also fine

[10:12] <ToddAndMargo> ^j  ???

[10:13] *** ZzZombo left
[10:15] <ToddAndMargo> I wonder is $var[0..Inf] would have also worked?  Trivia question.

[10:16] <timotimo> ToddAndMargo: if i understand correctly what you mean, you cannot do that by outputting from your program

[10:16] *** piccolo joined
[10:16] <timotimo> what is ^j supposed to do again?

[10:17] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v piccolo

[10:20] <ToddAndMargo> Linux: when you echo a binary file or part of one to your terminal, it screws up your terminal with weird control characters.  The solution is to type `sane^j` and it will reset your terminal.  Since I will be sending some weird stuff to my terminal, I wanted to end it with`sane^j`

[10:22] <timotimo> you can do something else instead

[10:22] <timotimo> run "reset"

[10:22] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 7e86d4e30: OUTPUT: «reset: terminal attributes: No such device or address␤»

[10:22] <timotimo> it's a program

[10:23] <ToddAndMargo> This one?  $ which reset     /usr/bin/reset

[10:23] <timotimo> yes

[10:23] <ToddAndMargo> `stty sane^j` is the full command

[10:24] <ToddAndMargo> any idea how to send a ^j ?

[10:24] <ToddAndMargo> reset:  Thank you!

[10:24] <ToddAndMargo> ^j ?

[10:25] <ilmari> ctrl-j

[10:25] <timotimo> ToddAndMargo: a brief google search reveals that ctrl-j just inputs a \n

[10:26] <timotimo> same as the return key, but i expect there's a mode for the terminal where the return key is configured to do something else

[10:26] <timotimo> so "stty sane^j" is equivalent to running the command "stty sane"

[10:29] <ToddAndMargo> not when the return key has been remapped.  Hmmm.  maybe all I have to do is `stty sane\n`.  I will try!  Thank you!

[10:31] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[10:32] *** cognominal-p6 left
[10:32] <timotimo> no

[10:32] <timotimo> you need qx or run or shell

[10:33] <timotimo> if outputting "foo bar\n" would cause "foo" to be run with the argument "bar", then you couldn'n "say 'hello world'" without it trying to run /usr/bin/hello with the argument word

[10:33] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[10:33] <timotimo> even though inputting something on the terminal usually results in your input being echoed back at you doesn't mean that whenever something is outputted at you it will also be input'd to the shell, if that helps explain

[14:27] <finanalyst> hi, I'd like to discuss the language.html page of the documentation. I have two png screenshots, one with new, one with current version. Can I share them here?

[14:27] <yoleaux> 02:03Z <tbrowder__> finanalyst: i’m going to sleep, but i leave my upvote for your doc changes, tell AlexDaniel so

[14:29] *** curan left
[14:29] <finanalyst> The language.html page is the link from the language tab at doc.perl6.org

[14:31] <finanalyst> currently it is a psuedo-random collection of content pages because the order is the alphabetical name of the pod6 file, but the Name of the page is defined inside the pod6 file. So someone coming to the page wonders why it is such a clumsy list

[14:32] <finanalyst> Tom Browder did a lot of work so that the order and subtitles would be taken from a CONTROL file. I have finished this work.

[14:32] <pmurias> finanalyst: yes you can share the screenshots

[14:32] <finanalyst> pmurias: how?

[14:34] <pmurias> finanalyst: dunno, upload them somewhere and paste the links here?

[14:36] <finanalyst> ok.

[14:45] <finanalyst> I have done nothing to the css. I think that the table dimensions could be made the same through css

[14:46] <finanalyst> Also in the PR is a intro to the Documentation, basically listing a few sections that should be read for a better understanding

[14:46] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: btw I left some commens on the PR (which is now already merged)

[14:46] <finanalyst> Mileage will vary. 

[14:46] *** pmurias left

[14:47] <AlexDaniel> automatic table sizing doesn't look too horrible to me

[14:55] *** itaipu joined
[14:55] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: looking at styleguide, it does not recommend sentence case yet, though it doesn't say anything regarding the page titles at all https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/writing-docs/STYLEGUIDE.md

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> however it recommends to fall back to whatever is used in Wikipedia, and using that it should be sentence case for titles

[14:57] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: so “Please use sentence case” :)

[14:59] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: OK. My preference for Section headings is Title Case. Title Case is used for the main title

[14:59] <finanalyst> But that's a matter of taste, and I will not push my view here.

[16:46] <tyil> I believe she tested with a VM, not a native system, but that shouldn't matter (right?)

[16:47] <timotimo> we do have people working on rakudo-for-BSD, but i'm not sure what exactly the state is

[16:49] <tyil> I know I got Perl 6 running on FreeBSD a while back

[16:49] <tyil> havent tried it recently

[16:53] <tony-o> i had it running on freebsd about 4 years ago, i'll try again with a fresh

[16:56] <CIAvash> Just so people know what El_Che was talking about:

[16:56] <yoleaux> @jmaslak @nxadm It's not just a marketing issue, you have to explain to people that Perl 6 is not Perl version 6. Read the http://alternativeto.net incident here(http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2016-12-06#l1507). After I explained things they asked me to readd the page. They also added a note so others don't get confused (@CIAvash, in reply to tw:1049648800510275584)

[16:58] <El_Che> yeah, I am nxadm as well

[16:58] <El_Che> like the aliasing concept ;)

[17:00] <ilmari> interestingly, perl is listed as an alternative to perl 6, but not vice versa

[21:11] <tony-o> even if he/she wasn't, the line of "it's tedious to explain that it's a different language" is more tedious to read than to explain and it only begs the question "why is <whatever alias that hopefully doesn't happen> constantly compared to perl if it is _not_ an iteration of perl?"

[21:49] <shmup> theyre not under one of the navbar listings (routines, types, etc) afaik

[21:50] <timotimo> that kind of thing is usually under language/

[21:51] <timotimo> NP

[21:52] <shmup> vim's perl6 stuff is godawful slow, i don't really get it. best you can do is setting the foldmethod to indent/manual, afaik

[21:52] <timotimo> you have to make sure no lines like # -------------------------------- exist in your file

[21:52] <shmup> syntax foldmethod is slow for all languages given buffer size, however

[21:52] <shmup> cool cool timotimo 

[21:52] <timotimo> if there's too many dashes or = or whatever it looks for are in there, it'll stand still until you ctrl-c

[22:06] <bazzaar> I wonder whether anyone would be so kind to have a quick look at a reduced-down Inline::Python perl6 script(+ module), it works, but there's a wrinkle I can't explain, it's all in the following gist (see first comment for background) : <script src="https://gist.github.com/bazzaar/d1436636613f1f1d7e0157df204f98ec.js"></script>

[22:11] <bazzaar> that's better, apologies

[22:11] <timotimo> i saw a crapton of javascript code with document.write and i was skeptical %)

[22:12] <bazzaar> is it possible for me to delete the previous link?

[22:12] <timotimo> no, but no worries

[22:16] <timotimo> could it be you're expecting the class to be a closure?

[22:17] <timotimo> hm, no, it doesn't seem to be the case

[22:56] <timotimo> oh, OK

[22:56] <DetroitDan> Thanks

[22:56] <timotimo> it is possible that you wrote something before the p6bannerbot gave you the +v status, and nobody would have seen it

[22:56] <timotimo> it's a measure against a spam attack that has been going on for a while now

[22:57] <DetroitDan> Ok, thanks for the update.

[22:57] <timotimo> i'll be AFK for another while, but you can put your question here and later check the irc logs to see if anybody answered in the mean time: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6
