[00:57] <Qwerasd> I've been searching google for quite a few minutes now but can't seem to find anything useful on using perl 6 for CGI. Does anyone know how I would go about doing this or where to point me to learn how?

[00:57] <Xliff> Qwerasd: Your best bet is to run Bailador on a backend machine and use a proxy.

[00:58] <Xliff> https://github.com/Bailador/Bailador

[00:58] <lookatme_q> Qwerasd, check out some module ? https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=cgi

[00:58] <Qwerasd> Hmmm :\ Perhaps I'll look elsewhere (other languages, possibly just perl5) then as I'd really like to keep it all under apache.

[00:59] <Xliff> https://github.com/supernovus/SCGI#apache-2-with-mod_scgi

[00:59] *** pmurias left
[01:00] <Xliff> But if you can do that, you can also run a Bailador app and set up a proxy in the same way.

[01:01] <Xliff> Depends on what the needs of the application are. If perl5 is the best choice, then that's what you use.

[01:01] <benjikun> Qwerasd: whatcha makin?

[01:01] <Qwerasd> It's a very simple processing task that just involves generating some files and returning them.

[01:03] <benjikun> I see

[01:03] <benjikun> there are a few (mostly old) CGI libraries in P6

[01:03] <timotimo> if it's that simple, why not just do cgi manually?

[01:03] <timotimo> put a .p6 file into your cgi-bin, give it the right hashbang, make it executable, and presto

[01:05] <Xliff> Especially if it is a simple CGI script and doesn't need any of the mod_perl mojo.

[01:05] <Xliff> I am really thinking about taking Slashcode and porting it to Perl6.

[01:05] <Xliff> Not that anyone uses that as much, anymore.

[01:06] <Qwerasd> Thinking it through I just realized I'm probably gonna want to accept more than just GET, so CGI probably isn't the best choice anyway. I think I'll probably just proxy a node.js server, though I will check out bailador first. Thanks for all the help!

[01:06] <benjikun> Yeah slashdot seems pretty old

[01:06] <timotimo> i like cro a lot

[01:06] <benjikun> ^

[01:06] <benjikun> Cro is pretty great, in most cases

[01:06] <timotimo> it's all about the multithreading and async

[01:06] <timotimo> but you can use it in a simple manner without too much magic

[01:06] <benjikun> mhm

[01:07] <benjikun> Qwerasd: I'd use cro over bailador

[01:07] <Xliff> benjikun: It is old, but has worked for years.

[01:07] <Xliff> And Slashdot is still running, IIRC.

[01:07] <benjikun> Xliff: fair enough, iktf

[01:07] <Qwerasd> I'll check it out, too. Thanks for the suggestions. I'm off now! ttfn

[09:07] <jmerelo> benjikun: what's with this person? Another kind of spam?

[09:07] <benjikun> Yep

[09:07] <benjikun> I've been seeing a few of these recently, just started popping up

[09:08] <benjikun> The p6bannerbot always cuts off the top (15 second delay or whatever it is)

[09:08] *** sena_kun joined
[09:09] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sena_kun

[09:12] <jmerelo> benjikun: So delaying is not enough, apparently...

[09:14] <El_Che> it depends on the spam

[09:14] <El_Che> this is probably not the same

[09:14] <El_Che> it help against the freenodegate crap

[09:15] <benjikun> I have a feeling if we just hosted an irc server @ perl6.org, we'd get little to no spam compared to this freenode stuff

[09:15] *** stmuk_ joined
[09:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v stmuk_

[09:16] *** stmuk left
[09:17] <tyil> benjikun: we have an irc server on perl.org

[09:18] <benjikun> tyil: Really?

[09:18] <benjikun> Does anyone get on it

[09:18] <tyil> but we'd also have less people here in general if the main perl6 channel was there (they do have one iirc)

[09:18] <tyil> one of the things of freenode is that most people using irc today, are already here

[09:19] <benjikun> I use rizon.net equally as much

[09:19] <tyil> rizon's not much better in terms of spam :p

[09:19] <benjikun> Yeah, fair enough

[09:20] <benjikun> I don't see the harm in having our own IRC server instead of utilizing freenode/rizon/any other

[09:20] <tyil> in general use, I'd get more "funny" people in my channel on rizon than on my same-named channel on freenode

[09:20] <benjikun> everyone would move to it if we decided

[09:20] *** stmuk joined
[09:20] <tyil> do we have a webclient to interface with that one?

[09:20] <benjikun> tyil: Yeah, less oriented solely towards open source projects

[09:20] <tyil> those are a must for random people to easily ask a question

[09:21] <benjikun> that wouldn't be hard

[09:21] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v stmuk

[09:21] <tyil> it wouldn't but it would be effort required to take nonetheless

[09:21] <tyil> which we dont have to now

[09:21] <benjikun> we could just link kiwiirc with some parameters for the perl6.org irc server

[09:21] <benjikun> for sure

[09:21] <benjikun> that'd be nice though, i agree

[09:21] <benjikun> for the people who don't use IRC, I suppose

[09:22] *** stmuk_ left
[09:22] <tyil> also, just as an aside, I'm looking for someone with a lobste.rs account that's willing to invite me so I can post my blog (as requested here: https://lobste.rs/s/hrxdoq/what_s_url_your_technical_blog)

[09:23] <benjikun> don't have one

[09:24] <benjikun> we could post more Perl6 stuff on hackernews or general programming subreddits too

[09:24] <tyil> I generally post my stuff to /r/programming and /r/programminglanguages (and /r/perl6)

[09:24] <benjikun> If you have a medium.com account, make sure to like/clap the articles on Perl6, lol

[09:25] <tyil> I dont have a medium account 

[09:25] <benjikun> same

[09:25] <tyil> I personally very much dislike medium, and wonder why people still use it

[09:25] <benjikun> yeah, I don't know

[09:25] <benjikun> simple I guess

[09:25] <tyil> for those on mastodon, I also often post perl6 stuff on there

[09:25] <benjikun> I've thought about getting a mastodon but never did

[09:26] <benjikun> twitter is a mess...

[09:26] <tyil> it is

[09:27] <tyil> there's a mastodon instance which has a twitter-like interface

[09:27] <tyil> if that's your thing :p

[09:27] <benjikun> maybe, I'd probably end up not using it in the longrun

[09:29] <benjikun> or do you just use mastodon.social

[09:29] <tyil> I use .social, but it is decentralized so you can use any other mastodon federating network

[09:29] <benjikun> Yeah

[09:30] <benjikun> Doesn't it aggregate the "toots" though

[09:30] <benjikun> or do the individual networks not share stuff

[09:30] *** spycrab0 left
[09:30] <benjikun> we could make one for perl6 and ditch twitter lol

[09:30] <tyil> I'm not knowledgable on the nitty-gritty internals

[09:30] <tyil> but iirc, it shares whats needed

[09:30] <benjikun> I see

[09:30] *** stmuk_ joined
[09:30] <tyil> so if you follow people, it'll share those toots to your instance

[09:31] <tyil> but of nobody on your instance follows someone from another instance, their toots wont be shared with your instance (until someone does look for that person)

[09:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v stmuk_

[09:31] <benjikun> oh, interesting

[09:32] *** stmuk left
[09:33] <tyil> it comes with a downside, though

[09:33] <benjikun> that not many people use it?

[09:34] <tyil> if you're on another instance as me, and nobody of your instance follows me, you also wont see my #perl6 tagged posts even if you're looking for #perl6

[09:34] <benjikun> they should make some sort of universal aggregator for that

[09:34] <tyil> you mean a twitter-like entity?

[09:34] <tyil> :p

[09:35] <benjikun> maybe it would turn into something similar but not like that intrinsically

[09:35] <benjikun> just fetch updates from all added servers & relay

[09:35] <tyil> the current solution to the issue is https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/139

[09:35] <tyil> and the current in-practice solution by some instances is to run a bot that follows everyone they can find

[09:36] <tyil> to ensure they get all the toots of other people from other instances

[09:36] <benjikun> I wish we could all stop using github

[09:36] <benjikun> it's just as bad as twitter

[09:36] <benjikun> but sadly, everything has built up a reliance onto it and gitlab has memory leaks

[09:36] <benjikun> cgit & running your own git server is what git was meant to be

[09:36] <tyil> I'm mostly using gitlab nowadays

[09:37] <tyil> if only because it's objectively superiour than github in many cases

[09:37] <tyil> and they actually sport a free software variant you can host yourself

[09:37] <benjikun> yea

[09:37] <tyil> github itself is closed source

[09:37] <benjikun> github isn't really FOSS in any way

[09:37] <benjikun> lol

[09:37] <tyil> ironic, for a company that hails open source as being the best thing ever

[09:37] <tyil> it should give you a slight hint as to their morality

[10:00] <tyil> I'd suggest putting +s on the channel, but I'm no chanop here (+s makes it secret, ie not appear in public lists)

[10:00] <benjikun> pmurias: unless they put in delays to compromise that effect

[10:00] <benjikun> that's kind of annoying to have, though

[10:00] <BinGOs> freenode doesn't have LIST

[10:01] <BinGOs> oh it does.

[10:01] <tyil> yes it does

[10:01] <benjikun> good idea tyil

[10:01] <BinGOs> I am sure I tried that before and it didn't work.

[10:02] <CindyLinz> In my channel, I kick each nick when it joined once, and leave a reason to it: please join again. And I accept it if it join again less than 3 mins..

[10:02] <tyil> thats not user friendly at all

[10:02] <tyil> say someone not familiar with irc joins through the webirc, they get kicked imediately 

[10:02] <tyil> they dont know the command to join a channel

[10:03] <tyil> they're basically being told only "advanced" people are allowed to be here

[10:03] <tyil> who know their way around irc

[10:04] <araraloren> that's so bad

[10:05] <tyil> I'd rather have +m, with a bot that NOTICES a person they need to wait 10s because of spam, and then gives them +v

[10:05] <tyil> which can be enabled/disabled by chanops in times of spam

[10:05] <CindyLinz> Can one, who is not familiar with irc, find a secret channel?

[10:05] <benjikun> Yes

[10:05] <tyil> you can still join it

[10:05] <benjikun> because it's listed on perl6.org

[10:05] <benjikun> lol

[10:06] <tyil> and all the public posts talking about it arent removed from the Internet :p

[10:06] <benjikun> yea

[10:06] <CindyLinz> I've also used +m mode, to prevent the bots speaking anything before kicked..

[10:06] <tyil> I doubt many people here joined through finding usin /list

[10:06] <benjikun> Honestly, these spam bots could just be googling "irc.freenode.net" and grep for the channel name for results

[10:06] <benjikun> even for secret channels

[10:06] <araraloren> why they not have a captcha 

[10:07] <benjikun> they do if you do it ton

[10:26] <tbrowder_> \o #perl6 (and spammers)

[10:26] <benjikun> howdy

[10:27] <CindyLinz> ....and spammers.. T_T

[10:28] <tbrowder_> i‚Äôm helping my brother with a class invitation list and he and an associate don‚Äôt agree with my head count. i was able to throw together a short p6 script to double check master list in short order.

[10:29] <tbrowder_> i‚Äôve almost forgotten how to do p5 cause p6 is so natural. i don‚Äôknow how python people can ignore p6 either.

[10:30] <tbrowder_> i love p6!

[10:30] <benjikun> same

[10:38] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: Python is almost the opposite of Perl 6.

[10:39] <tyil> python people generally ignore many things

[10:39] <Ulti> there is a large disconnect between Python the actual language and "pythonista" culture

[10:39] <tyil> that's their whole design goal: there's just one way to think about things

[10:39] <tyil> so you never even have to consider another way of doing things to begin with

[10:39] <jmerelo> tyil: which they drop straigh away when convenient.

[10:39] <tyil> they do, yes

[10:39] <tyil> that's a seperate issue, though

[10:40] <tyil> there's what, 4 ways to print of formatted strings now?

[10:40] <tyil> and none of them are considered the standard form

[10:40] <Ulti> python has loads of ways to do things, but usually only one accepted way thats the difference

[10:40] <jmerelo> Plus they hate functional programming. They used @ for decorators which is like saying, OK, we have this thing here, to make it clear we hate it we will use a weird sigil for them.

[10:41] <tadzik> and they removed reduce from the global namespace

[10:41] <yoleaux> 3 Aug 2018 17:09Z <lizmat> tadzik: please check https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/262

[10:41] <Ulti> the OO programming is especially limited in how people think about and write it in Python almost zero meta programming ever happens or more complex OO patterns 

[10:41] <tadzik> and their lexical scoping is shit

[10:41] <tadzik> grr

[10:41] <Ulti> yet the language is quite rich for it

[10:41] <Ulti> tadzik: they dont have lexical scoping they have dynamic function scope

[10:42] <jmerelo> tadzik: that made absolutely no sense. They dropped it into "functools" which is like saying, OK, we have to do this because it's fashionable, but you shouldn't, and just to make it clear we'll eliminate this keyword of the 33 we had. We will leave "map" to make it more evident.

[10:42] <tyil> OO in pythong is a pain tbh

[10:42] <tyil> you need to add "self" as an argument to all methods

[10:42] <jmerelo> Yep, scoping is like: you don't know scoping. I know scoping. You can't be trusted with scoping things. I'll do that for you, bozo.

[10:44] <tadzik> Ulti: oh yeah, you're right

[10:44] <tadzik> tyil: except when you call them ;)

[10:45] <Ulti> I used a metaclass last week there are several thousand voices online saying this is somehow inherently "unpythonic"

[10:45] <tyil> tadzik: oh yea

[10:45] <tadzik> jmerelo: yeah, and closing over variables is closing over a name of the variable. Which somehow survives the function declaration because whatever. And it's totally not surprising, not a design mistake and there are more important things to adjust :P

[10:45] <jmerelo> tadzik :-) Still. Widely popular.

[10:45] <Ulti> that its to implement a parametric singleton you can inherit from is essentially heresy.... yet the language quite nicely lets you do it once you spend the crazy effort finding the functionality no one uses

[10:46] <tadzik> the lifetime of variables is just complete bonkers

[10:46] *** koto joined
[10:46] <jmerelo> Although now Guido van Rossum has left for some problem or other. I really don't know.

[10:46] <tadzik> I was coaching a guy who wrote some python code for his stock market stuff or whatever

[10:46] <Ulti> the reason was the huge battle around assignment in expressions

[10:46] <tyil> jmerelo: I believe it was mostly due to the virtol he got from some parts of the community

[10:46] <Ulti> which is in part because of scope being how it is

[10:46] <tadzik> he had a function which used a variable that it neither declared nor took as an argument

[10:46] <Ulti> := instead of = to do the same operation

[10:46] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v koto

[10:47] <jmerelo> tyil: why? The community hated Guido? REally¬ø

[10:47] <tadzik> I told him that it wouldn't work, and just because he has a variable with the same name in mainline code somewhere else

[10:47] <tadzik> but I had to shut up when he ran it and it worked

[10:47] <jmerelo> tadzik: :-)

[10:47] *** sena_kun left
[10:47] <tyil> jmerelo: some ideas that he had were met with less than kind responses from some parts of the community

[10:47] <Ulti> tadzik: plenty of perl is like that

[10:48] <Ulti> especially historically

[10:48] <tadzik> oh, is it?

[10:48] <tyil> and he got annoyed enough at that happening at every new change in python

[10:48] <jmerelo> "some developers felt PEP 572 was a poor approach that reflected van Rossum‚Äôs opinions more than best practice." https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/13/python_creator_guido_van_rossum_quits/ That's the definition of Python, in general...

[10:48] <Ulti> yeah making crazy long reaching globals is basically a trope of self taught 90s code

[10:48] <tyil> that's the whole reason the dont have a switch

[10:48] <tadzik> jmerelo: haha exactly what I thought

[10:48] <tyil> rossum doesn't like a switch/case

[10:49] <tadzik> people adopt an opinionated language and then get annoyed that it's opinionated by someone else %)

[10:49] <tadzik> Ulti: oh, you mean the perl code around. Yeah, that happens

[10:49] <Ulti> its ok when the BDFL opinion is everyone should have their opinion facilitated with enough effort on their part

[10:49] <pmurias> jmerelo: re removing reduce, I think that the argument was that a loop would be better

[10:50] <jmerelo> pmurias: but of course! Loops are better for everything! With globally scoped loop variables!

[10:50] <tadzik> but in that case I was surprised it even ran at all, I expected a NameError. I should've copied and anonymized the code for later analysis, now I'll never know exactly what it was

[10:50] <jmerelo> pmurias: yep, they probably had some reason like that. Still, removing a keyword that way might have been LTA.

[10:51] <jmerelo> pmurias: no wonder it took the community so long to migrate from Python 2 to 3. They are still moving, far as I can tell.

[10:51] <tadzik> they now say "2020 is the absolute end, we're cutting life support in 2020!"

[10:52] <tadzik> they may have learned their lesson from Perl 6, but surely haven't learned the one about 5.8...

[10:52] <pmurias> jmerelo: I don't feel reduce combined with the python lambda syntax is super elegant

[10:52] <jmerelo> pmurias: but just because it's been designed to be that way. Eliminate reduce because they introduced lambdas is not so elegant either.

[10:54] * Ulti wanders back to his python

[10:54] <pmurias> jmerelo: I don't view the reduce with lambda as having any added value over a loop so removing it is a benefit

[10:54] <tyil> take-off for glasgow is tomorrow at 12:30

[10:54] <tyil> :D

[10:55] <pmurias> jmerelo: maybe the use case with a preexisting function was rare enough to just move it to a library

[10:56] <jmerelo> pmurias: but then, I guess it's more an opinion than actual measurements over programs. I really like reduce, in general. It makes you think in a different way about list transformation.

[10:56] <jmerelo> pmurias: but then I dislike loops, so...

[10:58] <tadzik> tyil: I'm jelly :(

[10:59] <tyil> tadzik: youre not coming? :(

[12:25] <stmuk_> well that looks an easy client side /ignore

[12:25] <jast> that is almost entirely about handshake which I don't care about at all. I care about combating spam, and exactly one sentence of that post covers that

[12:26] <jast> it's not *that* easy. it's a different nick/IP each time, and there are a whole lot of different messages (right now it seems like they come up with new messages every couple of hours)

[12:26] <stmuk_> I was refering to the lines avoid rather than the problem in general

[12:26] <stmuk_> s/avoid/above

[12:27] <jast> sure, and even then it's ~27 different messages

[12:27] <xq> easy enough (channel mode +r) if you're willing to accept that all legitimate users will need to have/make a nickserv account

[12:27] <xq> if not willing, it requires some creativity

[12:27] <jast> yeah, I did something quite similar to that in a different channel and spam is ~0

[12:28] <jast> but spammers will eventually scale up their approach, too

[12:39] <jnthn> I did +r on #MoarVM, but unlike #perl6 it's mainly populated by a small number of regulars, whereas here being accessible is a bigger deal

[12:39] <jast> in #git we have +q $~a plus a bot who gives +v to people who send a straightforward message to the bot

[12:40] <araraloren> and seems like normal people can not speak so qucikly

[12:40] <araraloren> XD

[12:41] <jast> if the bots actually start spamming without waiting... hard to tell here because the bot voices them after 40 seconds

[12:41] <jast> but it's a great idea for most spam

[12:42] <jast> actually I suppose you meant "speak so quickly" as in lines per time unit? yeah, true. some network have integrated support for flooding limits, that would be helpful, too, I guess

[12:43] <araraloren> yeah

[12:44] <jast> honestly the best thing would be a a central spam detection service that can be added to many channels, similar to how vipul's razor for e-mail works

[12:44] <stmuk_> block anything running an IoT-like sshd (ie. not OpenSSH)!

[12:45] <jast> *if* those spammers are IoT devices... and if those devices actually do have sshd... and if the router doesn't actually filter access

[12:45] <jast> where I live, internet routers default to locking everything down

[12:46] <jast> (home routers, that is)

[12:46] <stmuk_> all the ones I've checked have clearly vunerable sshd banners

[12:46] <jast> also you might actually be talking to a router's SSH port, so there's a decent potential of false positives

[12:47] <jast> in many places all the LAN devices are NAT'd

[12:49] <stmuk_> they are mostly routers hacked via several year old dropbear sshd or similar

[12:49] <stmuk_> either direct bufferover type attacks or default password guessing

[12:50] <stmuk_> there are probably 100,000s (if not millions) such system which will never be patched

[12:54] <stmuk_> eg. CVE-2016-7406

[13:39] <diakopter> ugh, sorry I was slow

[13:41] <jast> don't blame the ops, blame the spammers

[13:41] <diakopter> who runs p6bannerbot

[13:41] <jast> and whoever decided to not add any anti-spam features to freenode's ircd :}

[13:41] <tyil> can we make such a copter with a camelia logo instead

[13:41] <stmuk_> zoffix

[13:41] <araraloren> Can you tell him the color flash my eyes :/

[13:41] <jast> you can set channel mode +c to disable colours

[13:42] <jast> only disadvantage is it will strip camelia's coloured output, too

[13:43] *** skids joined
[13:43] <Ven`> what the heck

[13:43] <tyil> jast: does it strip colors on freenode?

[13:43] <tyil> on most ircds it stops the message from being sent

[13:43] <jast> yes, it strips the actual colour codes and preserves the text

[13:43] <tyil> if it contains colors

[13:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v skids

[13:43] <jast> seen it in action on a different channel

[13:43] <tyil> ah, interesting

[13:44] <jast> stopping the entire message is a relic from older ircds where CPU time was a concern

[13:44] <diakopter> nowadays we can borrow cpu time from hordes of pwned routers

[13:45] <tyil> heh

[13:45] <jast> scanning the message for certain bytes is a fair bit faster than copying strings around :)

[13:45] <stmuk_> that was a pi

[13:45] <tyil> I have a raspi

[13:45] <tyil> was it mine? :(

[13:45] <jast> yes

[15:09] <Zoffix> pmurias: so what is your proposal?

[15:10] <Zoffix> You've been poo-pooing every strategy we came up so far, so let's here your take then.

[15:10] <stmuk_> Zoffix: https://github.com/kaniini/antissh   

[15:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v reportable6

[15:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v committable6

[15:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v benchable6

[15:11] <Zoffix> stmuk_: and you've tried it and it banned something Freenode's new scanner didn't ban?

[15:11] <Zoffix> Same goes for suggestions about IPs. They're already being banned by Freenode.

[15:12] <timotimo> "asyncssh is kind of slow" - i wonder if our async ssh implementation is faster

[15:12] <timotimo> but a rewrite of antissh in perl6 will probably eat more memory, which is potentially more expensive than cpu time?

[15:13] <stmuk_> Zoffix: The fact the bots have targeted the author of antissh suggests to me it is useful in blocking them, as for Freenode you need to ask them and not me

[15:14] <stmuk_> another simplier option is to just kick anything with a dropbear sshd banner which would probably get rid of the majority of the bots

[15:15] <pmurias> Zoffix: I don't think I have a good on in store :(, maybe just giving voice to only registered users (and the in browser chat) and sending the users a message that they can't talk because they aren't registered

[15:15] <Ven`> rip me

[15:16] <Zoffix> stmuk_: how to get that banner, /whois or something?

[15:16] <timotimo> connect to the ip via ssh

[15:16] <Zoffix> ah

[15:16] <stmuk_> just telnet to port 22 on the host

[15:16] <pmurias> Zoffix: one node.js you don't have a voice if you aren't registered and they have info about that in channel topic

[15:16] <timotimo> oh, telnet's good enough? well that's nice

[15:17] <stmuk_> timotimo: that usually works, proper SSH neg is needed for some sshd I think

[15:17] <timotimo> if it works for dropbear, it's already a big win

[15:17] <stmuk_> I think antissh actually tries password guessing itself which seemed a bit over aggressive to me

[15:18] <timotimo> mhm

[15:18] <pmurias> is password guessing legal?

[15:18] <timotimo> it'd be funny if the irc server you're trying to connect to were banned from your computer by fail2ban and that would lock you out of the irc server

[15:18] <diakopter> not in the US

[15:19] <timotimo> though of course fail2ban doesn't ban outgoing connections to the ips it bans

[16:54] <xinming> a returned hash, If I try to access the key on it, I got error. Then, I dig down down down, %h.perl.say works, then I return pairs, and print key/value works too. But the app will die if I try to compare the value.

[16:55] <xinming> If I try to compare the $pair.key or $pair.value, I'll get error, but if I .say .perl.say  they worked perfectly fine.

[16:55] <xinming> I have no idea how I can hunt this bug down.

[16:55] <xinming> will wait ATM

[16:59] <timotimo> could you give a bit of code?

[17:00] <timotimo> you can try passing --ll-exception to perl6 and see where in the internals the error originates

[17:00] <timotimo> and what exactly is the error?

[17:01] <xinming> Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)

[17:01] <xinming>   in method <anon> at /home/xm/p6-projects/zen-hosting/lib/ZenHosting/Row/ZnPayment.pm6 (ZenHosting::Row::ZnPayment) line 18

[17:01] <timotimo> does MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=yes in the env vars make a difference?

[17:02] <timotimo> (must be set before moarvm starts, so you can't put it in %*ENV)

[17:02] <xinming> a moment, I'll try all you said

[17:05] <timotimo> i have to go AFK for now, maybe someone else can see what's up

[17:05] <timotimo> output from perl6 --version could also be helpful

[17:05] <xinming> Yea, I'm put in BLABGLA=yes perl6 script...

[17:05] <xinming> This is Rakudo version 2018.06 built on MoarVM version 2018.06

[17:06] <xinming> Do I need to try the newest version?

[17:06] <timotimo> it could help

[17:06] <timotimo> we skipped the release this month, but maybe try last month's release

[17:06] <timotimo> good luck!

[17:08] <jmerelo> xinming: you might try Rakudo Star, but I don't think there's actual code difference. Just a bit of the packaging.

[17:09] <xinming> jmerelo: I'll use the newest version, if we meet the bug, We should fix it if someone is helping

[17:09] <jmerelo> xinming: OK :-)

[18:24] <xinming> I've isolated the bug.

[18:25] <xinming> At least, we'll get a small script to start to test with.

[18:25] <xinming> though, I still don't get where the problem is. someone who is more knowledgable would help at least. :-)

[18:25] <xinming> http://termbin.com/zh7r    <-- Please check this

[18:26] <xinming> I'm hoping wether there is a way to write part of pod to file before executing the script, This will be helpful

[18:29] <xinming> in Row::Test,  the method added with .^add_method,  in that method, if we do  $.api-data.perl.say;  It succeed, If we do   `for $.api-data.pairs -> $p { ... }`   also succeed, But if we try to do something like    $p.key eq 'blabla'

[18:29] <xinming> the error thrown

[18:31] <xinming> But if we define the   method status () { $.api-data<status> }   <--- This works.
