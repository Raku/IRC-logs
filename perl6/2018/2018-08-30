[06:00] <Xliff> If I wanted a command line switch to act like the traditional verbosity count, would I have to use @*ARGS?

[06:00] <Xliff> So -v -> 1

[06:00] <Xliff> And -vvvvv -> 5

[06:01] <Xliff> for @*ARGS { when /^ '-v' / { $verbosity = $_.chars -1 } }

[06:23] <quester> Xliff: the first thing that you should think of for parsing arguments is the sub MAIN feature, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29704106/how-do-i-parse-and-validate-command-line-arguments-in-perl-6 for an example and https://docs.perl6.org/routine/MAIN for details.  But its convention is to use -v=5, rather than -vvvvv, so you may not want to use it for this particular problem.

[06:23] <TimToady> quester: I just gave Xliff a solution for that

[06:26] <quester> Hi TimToady.  Sorry, I just thought casual readers would get the impression that command line arguments are usually parsed ad-hoc, rather than using built-in tools.

[06:26] <TimToady> AlexDaniel & I were just being lazy and leaving out the 'sub MAIN' before the sig

[06:27] <TimToady> but yes, it's good to think of the innocent bystanders :)

Do you have any thoughts on how to implement these? I'm thinking either a separate Route argument or a forwarding method that picks off the last part of a route name, handing it off to another class. Or a way to de

[13:03] <timotimo> let's have a look at the code

[13:03] <timotimo> oh, bot's not here

[13:05] <timotimo> oh, huh, method match doesn't seem to have support for :i

[13:06] *** avar left
[13:07] <DracoChartin> hmm yess the :i adverb is not listed for match in the docs: https://docs.perl6.org/routine/match - Do you know why match does not support :i

[13:10] <timotimo> it should definitely be possible to implement it

[13:10] <jnthn> It's because rules are compiled, and :i is a compilation option

[13:11] <timotimo> jnthn: but if you supply a Str, it'll just make it / "$to-match" / anyway!

[13:11] <timotimo> which ... we could do it faster for Str than that

[13:11] <jnthn> timotimo: True, though it's probably more confusing to have .match accept :i only in some cases

[13:18] <tbrowder_> can someone please help with my git problem with perl6/roast?

[13:19] <timotimo> what's happening?

[13:20] *** kerframil joined
[13:21] <tbrowder_> my setup for both roast and rakudo are the same as  far as i can tell: git remote -v shows origin to my repo on github and upstream to perl6/roast and rakudo/rakudo.

[13:25] <tbrowder_> work...work... "git commit -a -m'msg'"; "git push origin new-branch".

[13:26] <tbrowder_> got to github in browser and start the  PR... on rakdo all looks fine, but on my last  several roast pr's it looks like some of the commits are not getting merge or are getting merged twi\ce.

[13:27] <timotimo> ^- this is my alias for "git lg"

[13:27] <timotimo> it shows stuff with nice lines that tell you how the commits relate

[13:27] <timotimo> maybe that can tell you what's wrong

[13:27] <timotimo> it could be that you have a merge commit in there that pulls master into your branch or something

[13:27] <tbrowder_> *twice. also, only with roast, i always get an automatic merge msg template when updating from upstream but not with rakudo.

[13:29] <timotimo> ah, yes, that's when you've based your branch on a remote branch that has changed in the mean time, when your branch also had changes

[13:29] <tbrowder_> timotimo: your theory sounds likely, thanks for the git code!

[13:29] <timotimo> since "git pull" is basically "git fetch + git merge"

[13:29] <timotimo> (and "git pull --rebase" is "git fetch + git rebase")

[13:30] *** pmurias joined
[13:31] <tbrowder_> so, in general, should i alway be rebasing when i "update" from master?

[16:45] <El_Che> timotimo: word in a VM suddenly (after an update) started consuming 100% of the cpu of the VM.

[16:45] <timotimo> does it already browse the internet?

[16:45] <El_Che> timotimo: it tuns out, MS phones home even if it's disabled in the settings, and the domain was blocked by my pihole

[16:45] <El_Che> timotimo: needed a group policy to really disable it and the machine was fine

[16:45] <El_Che> grr

[16:46] <timotimo> because my chrome gets to 100% of one core every now and then, and the chrome-internal task manager shows the "Browser" process taking the ~100% and the individual tasks below that add up to like 20%

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> Summertime: I guess I didn't

[19:16] <Summertime> sorry for not mentioning earlier!

[19:17] <geekosaur> AlexDaniel, not sure, may be related to the way method resolution has a tendency to use the type it knows instead of the one it's derived from, to avoid having to search for the right method? (see also complaints about overriding .gist in subclasses not always being effective because traversing a structure uses the type it knows instead of the actual type)

[19:23] <pukku> Out of curiosity, would there be an easy way to use the nqp JavaScript version to parse Perl6 and generate a syntax tree?

[19:23] <timotimo> should be very easy

[19:23] *** mcmillhj left
[19:23] <timotimo> if you have access to Perl6::Grammar and Perl6::Compiler (which nqp::getcomp can give you)

[19:23] <timotimo> all you need to do is run the eval method with a "target" option of either "parse" or "ast" or "optimize" depending on your needs

[19:25] <dant> Can I install modules via zef in an alternate location? I'm trying to package something for distribution but it would be awkard to include  a ~/.zef directory in my package

[19:25] <timotimo> zef has a --to option

[19:25] <timotimo> i don't know how you use it

[19:25] <timotimo> i mean beyond passing a path to it

[19:27] <pukku> OK, so now I just need to figure out which NPM package I should install.

[19:27] <timotimo> you could check if there's a travis file or something

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> dant: IIRC something like --to=inst#some-path-here and then PERL6LIB=inst#some-path-here

[19:47] * AlexDaniel did it a few days ago but can't remember 🤦

[19:48] <pukku> I wound up sending an email to P Murias, as suggested on the git repository, because I'm lost.

[19:49] <pukku> However, I also decided to take a look at what the parse target does in the perl6 binary, and it's taking minutes (so far, with no progress) to run over a program that usually executes in seconds. Do you know why this would be taking so long?

[19:50] <timotimo> it's probably spending a whole lot of time constructing the string to print out

[19:50] *** mcmillhj left
[19:51] <pukku> Huh. OK, the moar process is now taking 5G of RAM, so I guess that makes sense.

[19:52] <pukku> That probably doesn't bode well for my plan of using NQP to create a syntax highlighter. That would blow browser memory entirely.

[19:52] <timotimo> it does have a rather big blow-up factor

[19:53] <timotimo> oh, especially since it indents with two spaces per level

[19:53] <timotimo> i'd assume you'll end up with lines starting with multiple kilobytes of spaces at some point

[19:54] <timotimo> the textual output isn't terribly helpful anyway, you'll want to inspect the match tree manually so that you also get the "from" and "to" values for every single match

[19:54] <pukku> Another issue for my plan is that if I try to just parse a snippet of Perl 6, it won't do it if it can't find the definitions of various functions, so you can't parse it without the context.

[19:54] <timotimo> the dumper for parse cuts out the piece of code every node matched, which can sometimes be a whole lot at once (i think it abbreviates?) but it's more difficult to turn that back into location info, especially when the code contains the same thing multiple times in a row, like 1, 1, 1

[19:55] <timotimo> getting the output of the ast or optimize stages helps with that

[19:55] <timotimo> you'll have QAST::WVal nodes where the .value is the object it's refering to, and you have symbol tables available for every QAST::Block as well

[19:58] *** HaraldJoerg left
[19:59] *** HaraldJoerg joined
[19:59] <pukku> If I try `perl6 --target=ast -- foo.pl6`, where foo.pl6 contains only some of my program, it still complains about undeclared routines, just like the `parse` target. Back to square 1.

[19:59] <timotimo> yeah, that's a compile-time error

[19:59] *** timewasteable6 sets mode: +v HaraldJoerg

[19:59] <timotimo> at the end of the ast stage, references like that are already resolved

[21:30] <hythm_> Noted

[21:31] <timotimo> if two elements are considered the same by the sorting function but not by the comparison function, you'd be in trouble :)

[21:32] <timotimo> if your values have a WHICH with a ObjValueAt or what it's called, you can put them into a Set and WHICH them?

[21:38] <hythm__> My understanding is junctions execute in parallel, so would not that make it faster than sorting 

[21:38] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v xinming

[21:38] <timotimo> they are not implemented to take advantage of parallel execution yet

[21:38] <timotimo> and if the individual tasks are so small, like comparing two strings, the overhead from parallelization will be much more costly than what you can gain

[21:39] <hythm__> Makes sense

[21:40] <timotimo> we do have .hyper and .race that parallelize, but they are used differently from junctions
