[01:39] <parsonsNose_> I just read the docs

[01:42] <lookatme_q> parsonsNose_, index is the method of Str

[01:44] <geekosaur> https://docs.perl6.org/type/List#routine_grep if you just want the index, use :k

[01:44] <parsonsNose_> but that seems a bit cumbersome

[01:45] <Zoffix> ParsonsNose: .grep has `:k` adverb so you don't need to do the .pairs stuff

[01:46] <Zoffix> m: my @a = <1 2 3 4>; { say @a.first: $_, :k } for @a # also this, if you want just the first thing

[05:59] <holyghost> It can use several hypotheses now to learn with a set of experiments

[06:01] <holyghost> It's all built for speed in games, so no great OOP because of overloading and disptaching

[06:01] <holyghost> s/disptaching/dispatching

[06:02] <holyghost> light speed :-)

[06:06] *** domidumont joined

[06:08] <lookatme_q> what's that ?

[06:10] <holyghost> Bayesian learning ?

[06:10] <lookatme_q> hmm, the package

[06:10] <holyghost> See en.wikipedia.org

[06:11] <holyghost> It uses Bayes' rule to compute several hypotheses

[06:12] <holyghost> You can enter data and calculate the conditional probability of the hypothesis

[06:13] <holyghost> for example, in Age of Empires you move and attack by using chances e.g. of proxmimity

[06:13] <lookatme_q> oh, I see

[06:13] *** [Sno] left
[06:13] <holyghost> the proximity learn is a hypothesis where you calculate an integral to sum up 

[06:13] <holyghost> then you find a prob

[06:14] <holyghost> you throw away the hypothesis or narrow your probs

[06:14] *** [Sno] joined
[06:14] <lookatme_q> oh

[06:14] <holyghost> by keeping or adding hypotheses e.g. I want to attack because I'm close of an enemy

[06:14] <holyghost> the "want to attack" is a probability

[06:14] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v [Sno]

[06:15] <holyghost> Bayes just caluclate P(A|B)

[06:15] <holyghost> condition B with Prob on A

[06:15] <holyghost> then you go multi-variate

[06:16] <holyghost> Quite an simple concept but very much used in games e.g. RTS because it's fast

[06:16] <holyghost> RTS == real-time strategy

[06:16] <lookatme_q> cool

[06:16] <lookatme_q> It's in Perl 6 ?

[06:16] <lookatme_q> I mean you can using it in Perl 6 ?

[06:20] *** [Sno] left
[06:20] <holyghost> I will make an example game with that later on

[06:20] <holyghost> Java uses AWT

[06:22] <holyghost> SDL2 is full-featured for making a game 

[06:22] <lookatme_q> oh, not know that, I just know Minecraft is written in Java

[06:22] <holyghost> so is the perl5 package

[06:22] <holyghost> s/perl5/perl6

[06:22] <holyghost> I don't play games, I just make them :-)

[06:23] <holyghost> Civilization IV used python and Java 

[06:23] <holyghost> Perl6 games are not far away

[06:23] <lookatme_q> I play game, sometimes

[06:23] <holyghost> The math basically stays the same again because you need to gain speed

[06:24] <lookatme_q> oh

[06:24] <holyghost> I play Darkside Chronciles sometimes

[06:24] <holyghost> I like the Final Fantasy system 

[06:25] <holyghost> s/Chronciles/Chronicles

[06:26] <El_Che> awt? is that still a thing? I thought Oracle killed ir

[06:26] <holyghost> I think it's still a package with the import syntax

[06:26] <lookatme_q> not familiar with console game

[11:52] <leont> Should it matter if you use a module before or after a ¬´unit class X¬ª?

[11:53] <masak> leont: no, don't think so

[11:54] *** Ven` left
[11:55] <leont> Hmmmm

[11:56] <leont> I have a module (TAP) with a class named Version in it. It seems that loading it before a versioned unit declaration confuses it ("An exception occurred while parsing package version", "Default constructor for 'TAP::Version' only takes named arguments")

[11:56] <leont> The class isn't exported BTW

[11:58] <moritz> there's a built-in class Version

[11:58] <moritz> which might be used to version modules

[11:58] <moritz> which you might be inadvertently overriding

[11:58] <moritz> m: say Version

[11:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar fde779de4: OUTPUT: ¬´(Version)‚ê§¬ª

[11:58] <moritz> m: say v5.^name

[11:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar fde779de4: OUTPUT: ¬´Version‚ê§¬ª

[11:59] <leont> But I shouldn'tbe overriding it, as I'm not exporting that class. It's properly namespaced inside TAP::

[12:02] <moritz> if you declare a class, it's also a lexical symbol

[12:02] *** domidumont joined
[12:02] <moritz> m: class TAP { class Version { }; say Version === CORE::Version }

[13:35] <leont> Ah, I think I found it

[13:36] <leont> I can eliminate the error by removing two lines: ¬´$?CLASS.^add_method($name, $method);¬ª and ¬´$?CLASS.^compose¬ª

[13:37] <leont> Interestingly, it only fails when loaded from another module. If loaded at a "root" namespace (e.g. a script) the error doesn't seem to happen

[13:51] <leont> Filed as https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2378

[13:55] <jnthn> I hpoe you're doing those at BEGIN time...

[13:58] <leont> No one ever told me I should, but that does sound like something I should be doing

[13:58] <timotimo> m: class test { say "hi" }; test.new; test.new;

[13:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0fb95aef2: OUTPUT: ¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[13:59] <timotimo> it could very well be that that runs once per importation or something dangerous like that

[14:01] *** Sigyn left
[14:03] <leont> Moving the code to begin blocks leaves me with a "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)", even in cases that previously worked

[14:03] <timotimo> you have a .^compose inside the class body?

[14:04] *** Sigyn joined
[14:04] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Sigyn

[14:04] <leont> It appears $?CLASS isn't defined yet during BEGIN time

[14:05] *** scimon joined
[14:05] <leont> Or actually, it appears existent but not very useful yet

[14:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v scimon

[14:08] <leont> I'm not quite sure yet how to solve this.

[14:09] <leont> Possibly I should compose everything in a role and then compose that into the class, but I may end up with the same problem.

[14:10] <leont> Or invent my own ClassHow, but that seems rather like an overkill

[14:11] <timotimo> perhaps try a trait

[18:36] <perl5to6justforf> Hey i just started "using" perl6...I just created my first class. I put it in a seperate file from my main program. How can i "use" that Class? is there an @INC like in perl5 or a 'use lib' ?

[18:37] <perl5to6justforf> The Problem is that perl6 doesnt look in the cwd

[18:37] <perl5to6justforf> so in perl 5 i would have said "use lib '.'" or BEGIN { push @INC, '.'}

[18:41] <robertle> the environment variable PERL6LIB can be used to do this, be aware that the separator for multiple entries is not a colon but a semicolon

[18:41] <robertle> and you can still do "use lib 'lib';"

[18:42] <robertle> but after that the module lookup is a bit more complex than in perl5, at least to my ignorant eye

[18:42] *** regreg__ left
[18:43] <robertle> so I guess both methods above work ok for local tests, but once you build something that is meant to be deployed by zef you can't really do that anymore. good news, you also don't really need to anymore

[18:43] <robertle> also note that perl5 also does not look in cwd, at least not on all OSes 

[18:44] <robertle> to the great frustration of users, but for good (security) reasons

[18:45] <perl5to6justforf> yeah i know they removed '.' in perl 5.26 i think!? well yeah i know but its just to try the language not for anything serious ;)

[23:12] <xinming_> When I use rakudo source code on tag 2018.09  And I do ./Configure.pl   then make, I got error which is

[23:12] <xinming_> src/vm/moar/ops/perl6_ops.c:80:76: error: ‚ÄòMVM_SPESH_FACT_DECONTED‚Äô undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‚ÄòMVM_SPESH_FACT_RW_CONT‚Äô?

[23:12] <xinming_>      tfacts->flags |= MVM_SPESH_FACT_CONCRETE | MVM_SPESH_FACT_KNOWN_TYPE | MVM_SPESH_FACT_DECONTED;

[23:12] <xinming_>                                                                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[23:12] <xinming_>                                                                             MVM_SPESH_FACT_RW_CONT

[23:12] <xinming_> Oops

[23:12] <xinming_> sorry, I thought it's just 3 lines of erorr. :-)

[23:13] <xinming_> What do I need to do to compile it?

[23:13] <jnthn> Use the 2018.09 tag of MoarVM too, not HEAD

[23:14] <xinming_> Got it, thanks

[23:14] <jnthn> (That symbol was removed)

[23:14] <jnthn> Eventually we'll get rid of the extops (C code) in the Rakudo repo, so we won't have issues like this :)
