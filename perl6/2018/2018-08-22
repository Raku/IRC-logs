[04:46] <perlawhirl> https://gist.github.com/0racle/468e3272852f51fcf05498e11e51d090

[04:48] <perlawhirl> for those backlogging ... (&f ∘= &g) does not act the same as (&f = &f ∘ &g)

[04:48] <perlawhirl> not sure if a bug or not

[04:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37a30ab9b: OUTPUT: «4␤»

[04:56] <lookatme_q> yeah, without the * works right, thought it is not documented

[04:56] <lookatme_q> though

[04:57] <lookatme_q> m: my &f = o *.elems; say f 'this is a test'

[04:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 37a30ab9b: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[04:59] <perlawhirl> that last one is just elems, I think you mean `my &f = [∘] *.elems, *.words` which works fine, btw

[05:00] <lookatme_q> oh, I see, just a test

[05:00] <perlawhirl> it's only pairing the function composition assigment expression (∘=) with WhateverCode that seems to be the issue

[05:00] <perlawhirl> still curious if it's a bug. I will update my gist

[07:15] <masak> ZzZombo: rumor has it there's a way to edit files outside of Github. the secret, passed down by word-of-mouth through the generations, is somewhat of a legend in IT circles.

[07:18] <ZzZombo> Yeah, tell me more. What are you saying is that somehow if I ever need to review a change done by somebody ELSE, I can just clone the repo, _quickly_ jump to the changed file locally and review the change, as opposed to simply opening the file in question via the web interface and doing it here?

[08:00] <scimon> Firstly it would appear that if you want to use a live Supply created by a Supplier then in the whenever you need to use whenever $supply.Supply -> $v {} not just whenever $supply -> $v {} which is what I'd expect.

[08:01] <scimon> Wait... a sec....

[08:01] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v abraxxa

[08:02] <scimon> Ah. I think it's a binding / assignment thing. If I do my $supplier = Supplier.new(); my $supply := $supplier.Supply; I don't need the .Supply in the whenever.

[08:03] *** zakharyas joined
[08:03] <masak> as opposed to what?

[08:03] <scimon>  $supplier = Supplier.new(); my $supply = $supplier.Supply;

[18:15] *** sena_kun left
[18:15] <panicbit> Is there any chance of being able to call into rakudo from other languages at some point?

[18:15] * masak thinks so

[18:16] <masak> panicbit: Rust macros are hygienic, yes? something with symbols happens automatically?

[18:16] <panicbit> masak: they are hygienic. I'm not sure what you mean with your second question

[18:16] <masak> I mean the mechanism by which hygiene happens

[18:16] * masak .oO( hygiene doesn't happen on its own, you know! )

[18:17] <panicbit> I'm not sure how the mechanism works internally

[18:17] <masak> ah. too bad :/

[18:17] <panicbit> however, not all macros are actually hygienic

[18:17] <masak> that's good. :)

[18:17] <panicbit> macro_rules or "Macros 1.0" are hygienic

[18:17] <masak> oh!

[18:18] <timotimo> the three hardest problems in computer science are hugging and autopuns

[18:18] *** imcsk8 joined
[18:18] <panicbit> However, derive macros (and procedural macros in general) are not completely hygienic

[18:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v imcsk8

[18:22] <masak> thanks -- that gives me some threads to pull!

[18:23] <panicbit> One prominent example of hygine is probably the fact that you can't simply use variables without passing their identifiers into the macro http://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=20f96a93f42b9c4193e537fbfaf431a3&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015

[18:23] <panicbit> hygiene**

[18:25] *** releasable6 joined
[18:25] <timotimo> so a tiny bit like C++ lambdas that force you to mention everything you want to close over

[18:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v releasable6

[18:26] <panicbit> yeah, I think so

[18:27] <panicbit> note that this is not true for items. you can just use any module, function, const or static, without having to pass in paths or identifiers

[18:28] *** sauvin left
[18:29] <panicbit> And iirc, another part of hygiene is that a macro alwyas expands to either an expression or an item

[18:29] <timotimo> is an item a bit like an atom?

[18:29] <panicbit> you cannot do somthing weird like `); print("hacks"); foo(`

[18:30] <timotimo> ah

[18:30] <panicbit> timotimo: an atom? In Rust items are any decarations that can appear at the top level of a module

[18:31] <timotimo> OK

[18:31] <panicbit> that is functions, module declarations, functions, extern crate declarations etc

[18:31] <panicbit> statics, consts...

[18:31] <timotimo> in perl6 that can also be code statements, though

[18:31] <panicbit> yeah, that is not the case in Rust

[18:31] <timotimo> so i don't think there's something that corresponds to that

[18:35] *** imcsk8 left
[18:40] <Voldenet> rust macro rules are good, but at times overly verbose, compared to C macros

[18:42] <timotimo> C macros aren't verbose? :)

[18:42] <timotimo> you have to put so many parenthesises!

[18:42] <Voldenet> Yes, but apart from that, you can do many funny things

[18:43] *** imcsk8 joined
[18:43] <Voldenet> like generics :D

[18:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v imcsk8

[18:44] <Voldenet> in rust this makes little sense imo: http://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=b99946dc99826ca0fbcd4c857c7ff1f9&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015

[18:44] <Voldenet> you can't use x, even if macro clearly should have x in scope

[18:45] <timotimo> tbh i often use C macros when i have a crapload of places where some locals of the exact same name are in scope and have the same purpose and i don't want to repeat them over and over

[18:45] <Voldenet> so, it removes part of verbosity

[18:46] <timotimo> http://www.raylib.com/ - this could be a cool target for a perl6 binding

[18:46] <Voldenet> macros in C make writing test libs or handling errors easier and less verbose

[18:47] <timotimo> and can make debugging extremely tedious, and syntax highlighting b0rk

[18:48] <Voldenet> Absolutely, apparently people dislike debugging convoluted mess of macros

[18:48] <timotimo> my main problem is just that everything inside a macro becomes just a single line

[18:48] <timotimo> and you can't step around inside it

[18:48] <timotimo> in MoarVM we have macros that combine pushing and popping temporary roots, so it takes a block as "argument"

[18:50] <timotimo> if you happen to have an idea for that ... :)

[18:50] <timotimo> except maybe write our own C preprocessor

[18:50] <robertle> ... in perl 6!

[18:50] <Voldenet> That'd be actually cool

[18:50] <Voldenet> "You need perl6 to compile perl6"

[18:51] <timotimo> there's already parts of the C code that we use perl6 to generate, but the results are checked into git since they also don't change often

[18:54] <Voldenet> I agree that default C preprocessor might get better, but you can still annoy people

[18:55] <Voldenet> Something like this is better than the usual code http://ix.io/aRs

[18:56] <Voldenet> if I re-did that, I'd macro "return" as well

[18:56] <pmurias> timotimo: re raylib binding seems like it should be possible to generate them from the cheatsheet: http://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html

[18:59] <pmurias> timotimo: passing structs by value might be problematic (I'm not a NativeCall expert) but that's nothing a wrapper can't fix

[19:03] <panicbit> RE macro verbosity: Macros 2.0 will hopefully fix that ;P

[19:14] <panicbit> masak: oh col

[19:14] <panicbit> cool*

[19:14] <masak> as Dylan says "the meaning of names is preserved" -- so `x` inside the macro is different from `x` outside it

[19:15] <masak> ooh, a nice long github issue! ta <3

[19:16] <panicbit> what annoys me a bit is that the RFC is basically only like "we'll have a new macro thingy"

[22:18] <lizmat> .tell AlexDaniel S02-literals/quoting.t runs ok for me in either branch.  I'm not sure if the other files should have their failing tests marked as todo or to check for changed semantics: marking as todo feels more correct to me

[22:18] <yoleaux> lizmat: I'll pass your message to AlexDaniel.

[22:59] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's the todo() issue so I can fix that easily, no problem

[22:59] <AlexDaniel> but I'm still wondering how come the error does not appear on your side, hmm

[23:08] <Garland_g[m]> Is there a way in NativeCall to store a Callable in a CStruct Pointer? I need to be able to store a Perl6 method inside a CStruct so that it can be called by C code later.

[23:28] <vrurg> Is there a way to preserve attribute initialization from .new call when custom BUILD is defined?

[23:29] *** sena_kun left
[23:29] <TimToady> use TWEAK instead?

[23:29] <yoleaux> 18:12Z <tbrowder_> TimToady: any thoughts on treating pod formatted text downstream from rakudo’s treatment? i.e. rakudo treats the format chars as ordinary text and leaves treatment to the renderers.

[23:30] <vrurg> Or put it other way around: is there a way to hook into object creation between BUILDALL and BUILD?

[23:30] *** fake_space_whale joined
[23:31] <TimToady> anything is possible if you try hard enough, but we can't promise not to break it if you make assumptions :)

[23:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v fake_space_whale

[23:31] <vrurg> TimToady: I'm replacing attribute containers with Proxy and wanna do it before they're initialized from constructor parameters

[23:32] <vrurg> This I do understand. For that reason installing own BUILD or wrapping an existing one would do the trick to me. The problem is that I would have to initialze the attributes manually then.

[23:32] <vrurg> But the target is to preserve as much of the original language functionality as possible.

[23:34] <vrurg> Wrapping BUILDALL would be even better but this bug breaks everything: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2178
