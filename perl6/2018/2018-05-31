[07:17] <Voldenet> That may be a silly question, but how do I add a day to a date with local timezone?

[07:17] <Voldenet> and I'm not sure why dates don't have a timezone

[07:20] <Voldenet> It matters a little bit, because some countries might have skipped a day or two, but I guess it's possible to use DateTime everywhere

[07:21] <Voldenet> but in-timezone doesn't actually accept a timezone, which is even more confusing, it accepts a number

[07:21] <jmerelo> Voldenet: hum. Not sure I understand you.

[07:22] <jmerelo> Let's rewind. You have an Instant, a DateTime or a Date?

[07:23] <Voldenet> I have a string-formatted date and need to get a utc timestamp of previous and next day

[07:25] <jmerelo> Voldenet: the TZ is somewhere else, right? Or you have something like 2015-12-24T12:23:00+0200

[07:25] *** aindilis left
[07:26] <jmerelo> Voldenet: you can convert the date to UTC and then simply add or substract one day. There are all these methods to add/substract offset https://docs.perl6.org/type/DateTime#method_timezone

[07:26] *** zakharyas joined
[07:26] <Voldenet> hm, but adding a day to utc timestamp will lose the repeating hours

[07:27] <Voldenet> made by dst changes

[07:27] <Voldenet> I like how the day can have 23 or 25 hours thanks to that, it makes my life easier and better :D

[07:27] <Voldenet> and obviously, this is wrong: DateTime.now.later(days => 200).say

[07:28] <Voldenet> in CEST it returns a date that's one hour too late

[07:28] <jmerelo> Voldenet: but DST changes by country, even by state

[07:28] <Voldenet> Yes! That's why we have timezones :P

[07:29] <jmerelo> Voldenet: it's difficult to put that into a core module.

[07:30] *** dakkar joined
[07:30] <jmerelo> Voldenet: DST actually changes the TZ. 

[07:30] <TEttinger> 200 days and a move cross-country

[07:31] <Voldenet> It changes the offset, but the TZ remains Europe/Berlin for example

[07:31] <TEttinger> 200 days and in that time venezuela changes their timezone by 15 minutes

[07:31] <Voldenet> ...I think, I'm not sure

[07:31] *** mcmillhj joined
[07:31] <jmerelo> Voldenet: it's because in Europe all the TZ changes DST at the same time.

[07:32] <jmerelo> Voldenet: I seem to remember Arizona is, depending on DST, either in Pacific or Rocky Mountains time.

[07:32] <Voldenet> good heavens...

[07:32] <jmerelo> Voldenet: https://eu.azcentral.com/story/travel/2017/03/06/why-arizona-doesnt-observe-daylight-saving-time/98639074/

[07:33] <jmerelo> So you need additional information besides TZ to take DST into account. 

[07:34] <jmerelo> Voldenet: it's even worse, because inside Arizona, the actual time will depend on whether you are inside a Navajo or Hopi reservation.

[07:34] *** mrdside joined
[07:35] <jmerelo> Voldenet: you should visit Arizona. Beautiful country, if somewhat wacky re: clocks and time.

[07:36] <donpdonp> 'store all dates as utc, apply timezone tweaks for display.

[07:36] *** mcmillhj left
[07:36] <Voldenet> I really wonder why tz db doesn't have America/Arizona and how do people in IT deal with this issue

[07:38] <mrdside> hi. i asked tomorrow about new encoding. i found this - https://docs.perl6.org/type/Encoding and this - https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-encoding-huffman-pp6/blob/master/lib/Encoding/Huffman/PP6.pm6 . but i can't find information about 'Encoding::Decoder'

[07:38] <yoleaux> 06:21Z <jmerelo> mrdside: right; you would have to implement something that mixes the Encoding role.

[07:39] <jmerelo> mrdside: it's a method you have to override https://docs.perl6.org/type/Encoding#method_decoder

[07:39] *** aindilis joined
[07:41] <Voldenet> meh, for now I'll just add 86400 to a timestamp and hope nobody notices :)

[07:41] <mrdside> i should define class, that doing role Encoding with overrid there four methods. and what about 'Encoding::Registry'?

[07:42] <lookatme> I make a binding of libiconv currently

[13:57] <Zoffix> titsuki_: the bug is in that line of code :) sets are unordered and unless you stringify them with .gist or .perl (pending RT#131244 ) you'll get them stringified as unordered. The `is` routine is not an appropriate routine to test sets. Use `is-deeply` instead.

[13:57] <yoleaux> 30 May 2018 12:42Z <lizmat> Zoffix: re your last tweet: I would stick "@*ARGS.List.perl.say" in a script called "qw"  :-)

[13:57] <synopsebot> RT#131244 [new]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131244 Baggy/Setty .Str/.gist/.perl needs to guarantee order, like Map/Hash do

[13:58] <Zoffix> Ah, ok, .Str is also apparently meant to be ordered.

[13:58] *** mcmillhj joined
[13:59] <Zoffix> titsuki_: then there are two bugs. RT#131244 and using `is` routine, as say, `set($(<foo bar>), 42)` and `["foo bar", 42]` would still have the test passing despite being wrong types and having wrong contents

[14:01] *** Ven`` joined
[14:02] <titsuki_> so I should use "is-deeply" and use data type other than set (e.g., Array) ?

[14:03] *** mcmillhj left
[14:03] <Zoffix> titsuki_: you can use a set

[14:03] <Zoffix> m: use Test; is-deeply set(<a b c>), set <b c a>

[14:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - ␤»

[14:05] <Zoffix> m: use Test; is-deeply ["foo bar", 42], set($(<foo bar>), 42)

[14:23] <Juerd> What does ,= do, and what's the usecase for that?

[14:24] <Juerd> ",=" was mentioned in #perl as the operator that push could have been. I began to wonder if Perl 6 did anything with it. It does, but it doesn't seem too useful.

[14:26] <Juerd> In its defense @foo ,= 6; does do exactly what @foo = @foo, 6; does...

[14:26] *** nnunley joined
[14:26] <jkramer> m: my @foo = <foo bar baz>; @foo,=6; dd @foo

[14:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «Array @foo = ((my @Array_76155224) = [@Array_76155224, 6])␤»

[14:26] <jkramer> Wat

[14:26] <jkramer> m: my @foo = <foo bar baz>; @foo,=6; .say for @foo

[14:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «(\Array_66713320 = [Array_66713320 6])␤6␤»

[14:26] <Juerd> You get an array of a self-reference and the new value.

[14:27] <Juerd> @foo is @foo[0] is @foo[0][0] is @foo[0][0][0] ad infinitum :D

[14:27] <jkramer> Nice :D

[14:27] <jkramer> m: my $foo = 5; $foo,=6; dd $foo

[14:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «List $foo = (my \List_63201824 = $(List_63201824, 6))␤»

[14:27] <Juerd> But am I understanding it correctly, and does it have *any* use case at all?

[14:28] <jkramer> It's not listed in https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators

[14:39] <moritz> = is a meta operator; I don't think we list all the combinations you can do with operators

[14:40] <moritz> += *= /= -= etc.

[18:18] <jmerelo> Data in the usual place, the same TPF grant repo

[18:19] <jmerelo> March and April were the 2nd and 3rd with the highest number of issues open, BTW

[18:19] <jmerelo> April and May 1st and second with the highest number of issues closed.

[18:20] <jmerelo> I keep finding September'17 was a very special month. Summer 17, in general. Any idea what happened?

[18:22] <matzek> Hello folks. I have a perl6 script which is checking links, getting A records etc. and then stores all in a postgres database. The script is working well so far. But it stores nothing in a database when it runs via cron (fbsd, PATH is set properly). Any hints?

[18:23] <jmerelo> matzek: cron has usually got its own user. Also, possible problems with path.

[18:23] <timotimo> it could be unable to find its necessary libraries

[18:23] *** pmurias left
[18:24] <matzek> path is set - the job is running as root

[18:24] <matzek> top also shows that moar is running and consuming cpu time

[18:24] <timotimo> that seems like a very bad idea :)

[18:24] <matzek> there are many jobs runng as root ;)

[18:24] <jmerelo> matzek: could be library path. You'll have to find why it's not putting anything into the database. Most likely privileges; maybe root has not privileges to update the database...

[18:25] *** sauvin left
[18:25] <timotimo> well, if it can't find the libraries, it would probably die early throwing an exception

[18:25] <timotimo> so perhaps that isn't what's wrong

[18:25] <matzek> root has its own db 

[18:26] <matzek> so i should print some debug stuff in a file first, hm

[18:26] <timotimo> can always hook up to the moar process with gdb, "up" a few times until you're in a frame that has a tc available (for example MVM_interp_run) and then "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)", resume, ctrl-c, repeat

[18:26] <timotimo> to figure out what it's doing

[18:26] <El_Che> or do like I do and insert prints all over the place :)

[18:27] <timotimo> can you access the prints while the program is running, or only when cron has finished and sends the mail?

[18:32] <El_Che> cron sends a mail with the output

[18:32] <El_Che> or you can write to a file (>) etc

[18:39] <lizmat> jmerelo: maybe in the summer more people have time to try out fun things ?

[18:42] <jmerelo> lizmat: who knows. That might be the case...

[18:45] <matzek> nah, cron dont get an output..the log says just that the job has startet

[18:46] <matzek> lizmat: strange logic :D

[18:46] <jmerelo> lizmat: it's only that particular month in that particular summer, though...

[18:47] <lizmat> well, there *was* a Perl conference in Amsterdam that month  :-)

[18:49] <jmerelo> lizmat: so you think that was it? Lots of people were encouraged to try Perl 6?

[18:50] <lizmat> I'd like to think so  :-)

[18:50] <jmerelo> lizmat: it didn't happen in the American conference, though...

[18:52] <matzek> maybe thats the reason for perl6 :D

[18:54] <masak> is it just me, or is Python's read-and-evaluate style of traversing a program surprisingly similar to Lisp's?

[20:01] *** rindolf joined
[20:01] <AlexDaniel> this was a nice example: my $p = Proc::Async.new: ‘less’, :w; start { sleep 2; await $p.put: “hello world $_” for ^50; sleep 3; $p.close-stdin }; react { whenever $p.start { say ‘pager closed’ } }

[20:01] <AlexDaniel> it is somewhat unrelated to the question, but maybe some ideas can be borrowed from it :)

[20:02] <AlexDaniel> Guest59250: what program are you running? And what kind of user interaction is expected?

[20:03] <Guest59250> AlexDaniel: qx{apt-get install ...}

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> Guest59250: my $p = Proc::Async.new: ‘apt-get’, ‘install’, ‘pidgin’, :w; react { whenever Promise.in(3) { $p.put: ‘n’ }; whenever $p.start { say ‘done’} }'

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> like, that's one way

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> let's try with bind-stdin also

[20:11] *** matzek_ joined
[20:11] <AlexDaniel> here it is: my $p = Proc::Async.new: ‘apt-get’, ‘install’, ‘pidgin’; $p.bind-stdin: $*IN; react { whenever $p.start { say ‘done’ } }

[20:12] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: can we now declare Proc::Async to be expect replacement? :P

[20:13] <El_Che> Expect had a very simple linear api

[20:13] <El_Che> async tends to make your head explode :)

[20:14] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: sounds like a great module, well volunteered

[20:14] <geekosaur> and expect handles things that want a terminal, you need to at least do more work to make Proc::Async use a pty instead of a pipe

[20:14] <AlexDaniel> .oO( 6pect )

[20:14] <El_Che> yeah, I'll add it to the plan after I finish this damn dessertation :)

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> geekosaur: yes that's true :(

[20:15] *** matzek left
[20:15] <AlexDaniel> in fact I'm a bit surprised that apt-get says “Do you want to continue? [Y/n]” to a non-tty

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> like, who is it talking to?

[20:16] <geekosaur> …and now you;re in trouble on windows which doesn't do ptys (and other related things, like, er, entire tty interface. which makes interactive programs idiosyncratic in general when run in batch context)

[20:17] <geekosaur> iirc that's semi-deliberate. as in, they punish interactiove use in non-interactive contexts directly instead of potentially leading to nasty surprises later

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> makes sense

[20:18] <AlexDaniel> geekosaur: hey, but if I do bind-stdin to $*IN, what's going to happen exactly?

[20:19] <AlexDaniel> will it be a simple pipe?

[20:21] <geekosaur> depends on what it was given. by defaultg is is a pipe

[20:21] <geekosaur> bind-stdin is too late to change this

[20:21] <geekosaur> you have to plumb the process with the right thing beforehand

[20:21] <AlexDaniel> but the process is not started before .start

[20:22] <AlexDaniel> and you can't bind-stdin after .start

[20:22] <AlexDaniel> iirc

[20:22] <geekosaur> this may mean the interface has made a common mistake that renders it potentially broken in other cases as well

[20:23] <AlexDaniel> what do you mean? What common mistake?

[20:23] <geekosaur> the very fact you're asking this… no understanding of how inter-process communication works? how it has to work?

[20:24] <geekosaur> there are many common mistakes, really. I'm not exactly sure what it does currently therefore which of many mistakes it could have made

[20:24] <geekosaur> at one point the implementation did "link one procerss's stdout to anothrer's stdin" by making thjem separate and writing data --- once --- from one to the othet

[20:24] <geekosaur> which. very no.

[20:25] <geekosaur> worked for extremely simple things, broke anyone trying to actually use it

[20:25] <AlexDaniel> m: my $p = Proc::Async.new: ‘bash’, ‘-c’, ‘if [ -t 1 ] ; then echo terminal; else echo "not a terminal"; fi’; $p.bind-stdin: $*IN; react { whenever $p.start { say ‘done’ } }

[20:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «Proc::Async is disallowed in restricted setting␤  in sub restricted at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 1␤  in method new at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 32␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:25] <AlexDaniel> e: my $p = Proc::Async.new: ‘bash’, ‘-c’, ‘if [ -t 1 ] ; then echo terminal; else echo "not a terminal"; fi’; $p.bind-stdin: $*IN; react { whenever $p.start { say ‘done’ } }

[20:25] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar c80ea2f28: OUTPUT: «not a terminal␤done␤»

[20:25] <AlexDaniel> well, here it's not a terminal ofc

[20:25] <geekosaur> Proc::Async is using pipes

[20:25] <AlexDaniel> but if you run it locally

[20:25] <AlexDaniel> then it say “terminal”

[20:26] <geekosaur> hold on

[20:26] <geekosaur> I guess I have to go dig thought the impl now

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> but I guess I answered my question

[20:26] <geekosaur> and then confuse you a different way instead of the current way, probably

[20:27] <geekosaur> I *think* bind-stdi9n means you connected to its input, so output is still the thing you ran it on

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> ooooooh

[20:27] <geekosaur> because stdin and stdout are not magically always connected, otherwise you couldn't use pipes a | b | c becuase the first would loop a and b together

[20:27] <geekosaur> leaving nothing for c

[20:28] <geekosaur> *terminals* bind the tty / pty to all of stdin, stdout, stderr by default

[20:29] <geekosaur> ok, yes, bind-stdin tells the Proc::Async how to plumb the process's input

[20:29] <AlexDaniel> right

[20:29] <geekosaur> output is not affected and will be that of the perl script

[20:29] <Guest59250> AlexDaniel: Method 'bind-stdin' not found for invocant of class 'Proc::Async'

[20:30] <AlexDaniel> but my -t check is useless, right…

[20:30] <geekosaur> which for camelia is a service environment, stdout is a log file or /dev/null depending on how service is set up

[20:30] <geekosaur> and for a command line is going to be the pty unless redirected

[20:30] <AlexDaniel> Guest59250: what is your rakudo version?

[20:30] <geekosaur> as for that last, Proc::Async::Pipe actually

[20:31] <Guest59250> AlexDaniel: This is perl6 version 2015.11 built on MoarVM version 2015.11

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> Guest59250: well, that's very old, in fact that's even before the first stable language release

[20:31] <AlexDaniel> huggable: deb

[20:31] <huggable> AlexDaniel, Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu Rakudo packages: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#rakudo-pkg

[20:31] <Guest59250> I'm using Mint.

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> Guest59250: maybe you can grab a package from here ↑

[20:32] <Guest59250> They don't have Mint?

[20:32] <geekosaur> doesn't look like we currently expose pty. iirc that's a separate libuv interface and may be difficult, not to say unportable to windows

[20:32] <geekosaur> Guest59250, for very nearly everything Mint is Ubuntu

[20:33] <geekosaur> unless you're running LMDE in which case it's the corresponding debian unstable

[20:33] <AlexDaniel> unless you're using a debian-based mint, I think

[20:34] <matzek_> .oO( what about openbsd :( )

[20:34] <AlexDaniel> matzek_: it should work if you compile it

[20:35] <AlexDaniel> we do try to keep it working on openbsd & freebsd

[20:35] <matzek_> rakudo * wont build and rakudobrew also dont build on obsd 6.3

[20:35] <AlexDaniel> matzek_: btw maybe you can even help with this ticket: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1867

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> .seen Kaiepi

[20:36] <yoleaux> I saw Kaiepi 27 May 2018 11:10Z in #perl6: <Kaiepi> thanks

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> matzek_: maybe talk to Kaiepi about that, it looks like they have it working on 6.3

[20:36] <matzek_> fbsd works well

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> geekosaur: thank you, by the way

[20:37] <matzek_> currently there is a port for rakudo 2017.10 or on obsd

[20:37] <geekosaur> POSIX IPC is tricky business. ptys make it more so. at one point there was something in ecosystem with a simple expect interface, I think, but it may be broken

[21:45] <geekosaur> it doesn't automatically unwind itself into a list, no. 'iterable' sounds like you;re using a different model than per;

[21:45] <geekosaur> perl6

[21:45] <scovit> geekosaur just learning

[21:46] <b2gills> scovit: You want to call .keys on a Set

[21:46] <geekosaur> +@ gives you a list made up of everything left, the one thing left is a set

[21:46] <b2gills> +@ will reuse the list if there is one *@ will flatten **@ doesn't flatten

[21:49] <scovit> b2gills to use multi was the solution proposed also by moritz. But I am left wondering how different is this from augment that is considered MONKEY

[21:49] <geekosaur> multi is declaring up front you want to allow additions. augment allows arbitrary additions at runtime

[21:49] <geekosaur> so augment is monkey patching something not intended for it

[21:50] <geekosaur> also you can't alter a multi across modules iirc, but augment can. (this means augment forces runtime resolution whereas multi can be compile time resolved because it knows it will see all variants)

[21:51] <geekosaur> runtime is more flexible but a lot slower, no optimizations possible

[21:51] <scovit> I understand.. compile time errors are good also

[21:51] <geekosaur> not just errors. if the compiler knows which variant will be used ahead of time, it can skip the runtoime part entirely and hardcode the one it knows

[21:52] <geekosaur> this makes for fairly big speedups compared to runtime dispatching

[21:52] <El_Che> if you don't need something specific from runtime, always to for compile time

[21:52] <El_Che> errors will be catch before data is touched
