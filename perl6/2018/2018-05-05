[00:01] <timotimo> JIT isn't supported on platforms with 4 byte pointers.

[00:01] <timotimo> this does bode well

[00:02] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:02] <timotimo> and i got a higher resolution this time \o/

[00:02] <El_Che> last time I asked, 32-bit is no-Jit territory (more relevant on ARM)

[00:03] <timotimo> yes

[00:03] <timotimo> well, ARM not having a jit isn't because of 32bit

[00:04] <timotimo> it's just that x86 has very few registers, and using the template jit we built to make that work would be rather painful

[00:04] <timotimo> ARM does have more registers, doesn't it? even under 32bit?

[00:04] <timotimo> oh crap

[00:48] <todd> timo: C:\Users\Claire>perl6 -v This is Rakudo version 2018.04.1-2-g68e0dad78 built on MoarVM version 2018.04.1 implementing Perl 6.c.

[00:48] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:49] <todd> and it is working nicely with the program I wrote them.  :-) :-) :-)

[00:49] <timotimo> oh, right, that's not exactly the version

[00:49] <timotimo> and everybody else who sees that version will get confused

[00:49] <timotimo> just pretend it's exactly 2018.04.01

[00:49] <todd> still can't pin it to the task bar though

[00:50] <todd> I am good at pretending!  Any change of getting this up in the perl6.org download?

[00:50] <timotimo> well, it's not a rakudo star, i.e. no modules bundled at all. and not an installer

[00:50] <timotimo> it'd be about 110% inofficial

[00:50] <timotimo> also, i can't support this, i don't have a windows of my own

[00:50] <timotimo> oh, also, i had to throw out the unicode symbols for pi, tau, and e

[00:51] <timotimo> so you won't be able to use them in your programs, just use "pi", "tau", and "e" instead

[00:51] <todd> hey, the 2016 version is so buggy it is almost unusable.  I used it anyway

[00:51] <El_Che> timotimo: does star throw those out?

[00:51] <todd> can you compile it on 64 bit windows?

[00:52] <timotimo> "throw those out"?

[00:52] <El_Che> " oh, also, i had to throw out the unicode symbols for pi, tau, and e"

[00:52] <timotimo> oh

[00:53] <timotimo> no, that's literally a bad hack to get around a compile failure that i have no idea how it happens

[00:53] <todd> how about thorn?  Just being silly.  Pay no atention

[00:53] <El_Che> 3am

[00:53] <El_Che> to bed

[00:53] <El_Che> see you

[00:54] *** mcmillhj left
[01:04] *** mcmillhj joined
[01:07] <timotimo> the real question is: why does rakudo think the declaration for those is invalid? something strange is happening and i don't have the patience to debug this over RDP with tools i'm not familiar with in the slightest 

[01:07] <timotimo> also, it's not letting me use my own keyboard layout, which makes typing special characters a trial-and-error game of fun

[01:09] *** mcmillhj left
[01:09] <timotimo> El_Che: i'm sure you would have wanted to know how to automate building packages using appveyor. i cannot supply that. i just RDP'd in there and did all necessary changes, zipped it up, used a file-transfer website to get the zip onto my disk and uploaded it manually

[01:10] <timotimo> so it's basically 100% manual with the benefit that i didn't have to set up a windows VM on my local machine

[09:56] <jmerelo_> So, who's squashatoning?

[09:57] <ufobat> jmerelo, hi o/

[09:58] <ufobat> i wanted to thank you for helping me with the rakudo-star image, i switched to your alpine-perl6 image now, DBIish works now, but Bailador dosn't ;)

[10:01] <ufobat> how does zef parse tests results while installing modules? it might use TAP::Harness, if installed? but if it's not installed.

[10:01] <ufobat> ?

[10:03] *** araraloren joined
[10:04] <jmerelo_> ufobat: my pleasure.

[10:04] <jmerelo_> ufobat: I seem to remember I created some Dockerfile specifically for Bailador, some time ago...

[10:04] <jmerelo_> ufobat: I couldn't do much anyway with that... 

[10:05] <ufobat> i've got a test that is marked as TODO and i think zef missreads that

[10:06] <jmerelo_> ufobat: there is another alpine container with all test stuff included

[10:06] <ufobat> https://nopaste.xyz/?4447f7a87d10cd0e#c3SMTcAuySVpuawh1Vxn97pvqm/1UW1JqrE4CRgtfBQ=

[10:07] <ufobat> there you can see that TAP::Harness is to be installed as well, and you can see that the output of the failing test

[10:07] <jmerelo_> TAP::harness needs perl, but everything is included in this container... https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/test-perl6/

[10:08] *** todd left
[10:08] <ufobat> i do a zef install Bailador -> Bailador fails; i do a zef install --serial Bailador -> Bailador fails, but all dependencies stay/are installed; i do a zef install Bailador -> works

[10:09] <jmerelo> But what fails there has nothing to do with TAP, there is a problem with the content.

[10:09] <ufobat> so my assumption, zef works differently as soon as TAP::Harness is installed 

[10:09] <jmerelo_> ufobat: that's basically right.

[10:10] <jmerelo_> ufobat: zef uses what's available. It uses TAP::Harness if it's available, but there are a couple of fallback options.

[10:11] <jmerelo_> Problem is TAP::Harness needs perl.

[10:11] *** jmerelo left
[10:11] <ufobat> imho in my nopaste link that is not a failure, thats a testcase marked as todo

[10:11] <ufobat> https://docs.perl6.org/language/testing#index-entry-todo-todo%28%24reason%2C_%24count_%3D_1%29

[10:11] * jmerelo_ realizes I was chatting in a couple of different terminals.

[10:11] *** espadrine joined
[10:12] <ufobat> m: use Test; ok "works"; todo "lala"; nok 1; done-testing;

[10:12] <ufobat> this is a successful test

[10:12] <jmerelo_> Ah, OK. Anyway, the docker container above should have everything you need for testing. You can use it in travis as-is. 

[10:13] <ufobat> jup i just need to have zef install TAP::Harness && zef install All The Others

[10:13] <ufobat> but thats a workaround, zef should be able to parse the todos, right?

[10:14] *** sjoshi joined
[10:16] <jmerelo_> ufobat: I think it's cpanm TAP::Harness, if I remember correctly. And right, it will always use the available TAP parser, but maybe the fallback option is not as good and is not able to parse the TODOs.

[10:17] * ufobat is a little confused

[10:17] <ufobat> i ment perl6 TAP::Harness

[10:17] <ufobat> oh you mean zefs fallback is perl5 TAP::Harness?

[10:18] <jmerelo_> ufobat: I think so. Let me check...

[10:19] <ufobat> i think this is worth to be at least documented in zef as well in Bailador, because its not obvious why the installation fails :)

[10:20] <jmerelo_> right, I'm installing perl5's Test::Harness https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/alpine-perl6/~/dockerfile/ which is used later on by zef

[10:22] <jmerelo_> ufobat: and this is what they answered https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/214 when I had a similar problem...

[10:22] <jmerelo_> ufobat: baseline is you've got to install prove instead of prove6. zef will use that.

[10:23] <jmerelo_> ufobat: and yep, a bit of documentation will always help

[10:24] <jmerelo_> ufobat: the final fallback is running tests one by one https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/214#issuecomment-348713575

[10:26] <ufobat> after installation of the perl6 module TAP::Harness, the installation of Bailador is successful. doesn't that mean zef preferes proove6 over proove?

[16:17] <timotimo> zef gets a little confused

[16:17] <jmerelo> timotimo: I've seen that in some other place recently... 

[16:18] <AlexDaniel> haha, someone should put a btc/usd graph on top of that to show negative correlation :D

[16:18] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: oh wow... I had forgotten about that.

[16:18] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: :-)

[16:19] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: There are several issues there. One of them is this https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1838

[16:19] <AlexDaniel> oh yeah‚Ä¶

[16:19] <timotimo> tadzik: want me to use a "with"/"else" instead?

[16:19] <jmerelo> Second is that there is invalid HTML being generated, which makes checklink confused

[16:20] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I'm halfway there with Pod::to::BigPage, but Pod::to::HTML is another piece of cloth. 

[16:20] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: once the first is fixed, maybe we could look at sharing code and fix the other one.

[16:21] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I would say that genuine 404 are next to none, at least checking it in the single-page version returns no "real" 404. 

[16:22] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: also, addressing that issue above might fix a good deal of the missing links, leaving only those generated by errored HTML.

[16:25] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: that's why we have grep and ctrl+f :)

[16:25] <AlexDaniel> ctrl+f for 404 worked very well for me in the past

[21:26] <cono> ah, old one

[21:26] <cono> I have another issue :)

[21:26] <cono> but maybe its something about lack of knowledge in MMD

[21:31] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i think it's because most of them come directly from moarvm

[21:31] <timotimo> yeah

[21:31] <timotimo> the open function checks "is it a directory" before trying to open, that's racy

[21:31] <timotimo> so i put a CATCH that does a message check instead

[21:32] <MasterDuke> that's from https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/io/syncfile.c#L460

[21:33] <timotimo> i'm aware ;)

[21:33] <timotimo> in theory we could put an hllsym

[21:33] <MasterDuke> what's the best way to "upgrade" them to typed exceptions?
