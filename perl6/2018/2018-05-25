[08:06] <jmerelo> Another SO question with a problem I bumped into today https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50524378/element-membership-and-identity

[08:06] <jmerelo> m: say (1,1) === (1,1)

[08:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar afbbf8f82: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[08:06] <jmerelo> Related to that above, but also to how set membership works.

[08:09] *** pmmmm left
[08:09] <donpdonp> my $a = (1,1); $a === $a => true

[08:09] <donpdonp> === is more about pointer equality

[08:09] <donpdonp> (1,1) eqv (1,1) => true

[08:09] <donpdonp> note I know little of what I speak, but I had the same sort of structural comparison question (two Bufs) and solved it with eqv

[08:09] *** stmuk_ joined
[08:10] <jmerelo> donpdonp: that seems to be the case; the problem is that set membership seems to be using that instead of eqv or ==

[08:10] <jmerelo> So the strange behavior I point to in the SO question occurs...

[09:05] <lookatme> sorry, splice

[09:05] <lookatme> Qwerasd, no, it would not work in that form

[09:05] <Qwerasd> How would I do that though? I don't have the index.

[09:05] <lookatme> Using while I think

[09:05] <Qwerasd> I don't really want to use the long c-style for loop if I don't have to.

[09:07] <lookatme> It's UB in Perl 6 that remove element from Array you are iterating

[09:07] <Qwerasd> UB?

[09:07] <lookatme> yeah, I think 

[09:08] <lookatme> undefined behavior, you must heard it from C

[09:12] <AlexDaniel> Qwerasd: how big is the array? Can't you just use grep?

[09:12] <AlexDaniel> or map

[09:13] <Qwerasd> I just bit the bullet and used loop(;;)

[09:13] <AlexDaniel> right, that will work

[09:13] <lizmat> Qwerasd: what's wrong with just 'loop { }' ?

[15:26] <Luneburg> Is there any way to loop through a string?

[15:26] <geekosaur> you want substr, not indexing

[15:26] <geekosaur> a Str is a single entity, not a fake list

[15:26] <timotimo> what you really want is .comb, it looks like

[15:26] <geekosaur> or that, yes

[15:28] <Luneburg> geekosaur: Thanks, what does .comb actually do though? I can see it adds spacing between the characters?

[15:29] <jkramer> Without arguments it returns a list of the single characters

[15:29] <geekosaur> that's just how a list is rendered by default. it explodes the Str into a list of characters

[15:30] <Luneburg> Thanks ;)

[15:31] <geekosaur> you can use .perl to see what the value actually looks like, or use "dd" instead of "say" to get even more internal detail (usually too much unless you're debugging)

[15:31] <geekosaur> m: say "abc".comb.perl

[15:32] <geekosaur> (Seq is a read-only, one-shot list; saves memory and garbage collection time for most ephemeral lists)

[15:34] <b2gills> Luneburg: rather than `loop (my $i = 0; $i <= $sequence.chars; $i++) {…}` use `for 0..$sequence.chars -> $i {…}` or better yet in this case `for $sequence.comb { say $_ }`

[15:35] <timotimo> also a very useful feature of comb

[15:35] <b2gills> Basically you should almost never use `loop (;;)`, as you are probably doing something that is easier done another way.

[17:47] <lucasb> whenever you want to call methods on a new anonymous state var, you have to wrap it in parentheses, right? like ($).foo, (@).bar and (%).baz

[17:48] <lucasb> because otherwise it would be interpreted as calls to the object/class the code is inside: $.foo, @.bar, %.baz

[17:48] *** margeas left
[17:49] <jmerelo> lucasb: say what?

[17:49] <raschipi> I didn't see any other idiom to do that, you get to create one.

[17:49] <lucasb> *except* when the call is a subscripts, like @.[...] or %.{...}, %.<...>, in this case you are calling on the anonymous state var

[17:49] <jmerelo> lucasb: is that documented?

[17:50] <lucasb> jmerelo: which part? :)

[17:50] <El_Che> why would you use anonymous vars if you reference the later? Is there an added value there?

[17:50] <jmerelo> lucasb: well, pretty much everything...

[17:51] <lucasb> ok, let me conclude, then I go back to the raised issues :D

[17:52] <lucasb> What I'm suggesting is that syntax like @.[42] %.{'key'}, %.<key> be changed to mean access to the current object/class the code is within

[17:52] <lucasb> m: $.foo

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Variable $.foo used where no 'self' is available␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3$.foo7⏏5<EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        term␤»

[17:53] <jmerelo> lucasb: $.foo is syntactic sugar for self.foo

[17:53] <lucasb> obviously, *if* the objects are of the type Associative and Positional, etc.

[17:53] <jmerelo> that's probably the reason why you have to put the () around, to disambiguate

[17:53] <lucasb> jmerelo: you are correct. the same way @.foo and %.foo also are

[17:54] <lucasb> jmerelo: correct. and I want that to stay the same

[17:54] <lucasb> in things like @.[42] %.{'key'}, %.<key>, it should be required to put () around too!

[17:55] <lucasb> (@).[42] (%).{'key'}, (%).<key> if you want to access the anonymous state var, otherwise let this syntax mean access to the current self object

[17:56] <jmerelo> lucasb: so what you are saying is try to extend that same criterium to other "bracketing" things, so that $. == self whenever possible.

[17:56] <lucasb> yes, exactly :)

[17:56] <jmerelo> so @.[42] would be self[42] if that makes any sense.

[17:57] <lucasb> except that there's a problem with "$." being the old P5 special var, so I took it out of the examples

[17:57] <jmerelo> lucasb: OK, it's not a documentation problem then :-), although it might be good if you open an issue with some example where disambiguation needs to be done.

[17:57] <jmerelo> lucasb: old p5 special vars are not really a problem. 

[17:58] <jmerelo> lucasb: maybe you should open a discussion in the rakudo repo, after checking what the specification says about that. If it's not specced, it might be reasonably argued.

[18:01] *** Zoffix joined
[18:01] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel++ samcv++ # release

[18:01] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel++ samcv++ and the rest of the team 

[18:02] <Zoffix> lucasb: why add a gazillion variants of some cryptic syntax? Especially one that's close to anon vars.

[18:02] <Zoffix> Reminds me of a joke I heard on Twitter: "Perl 6 is what happens when the answer to every bikeshedding session is: 'Let's do both!'"

[18:03] <jmerelo> Zoffix: now that you mention twitter... https://twitter.com/jjmerelo/status/1000069722224852992

[18:03] <Zoffix> jmerelo: what am I looking at?

[18:04] <jmerelo> Zoffix: the official extraofficial announcement of perl 6 2018.05

[18:05] <lucasb> Zoffix: my suggestion would make things more orthogonal than they currently are

[18:05] <Zoffix> lucasb: and especially one that's close to attribute syntax that isn't entirely trivial for newcomers to understand. It's quite a lot of mental processing required to discern $.<foo> between anon state var, attribute access or just a method call on self.

[18:05] <jmerelo> Zoffix: I mean, if you're looking at that Twitter URL. 

[18:05] <Zoffix> I don't know why folks use $.foo syntax for non-attribute method calls. Seems like a good way to confuse the reader

[18:07] <lucasb> well, maybe folks have a usecase, since self.foo is different from $.foo :)

[18:08] <lucasb> They are contextualizers, right? $.foo is $(self.foo), @.foo is @(self.foo), %.foo is %(self.foo)

[18:08] <lucasb> m: class { method foo { 1,2,3 }; method bar { self.foo } }.bar.perl.say

[18:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «(1, 2, 3)␤»

[18:08] <lucasb> m: class { method foo { 1,2,3 }; method bar { $.foo } }.bar.perl.say

[18:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «$(1, 2, 3)␤»

[18:09] <Zoffix> lucasb: because it's not just %.<foo>. It's also %».<foo>, %».+<foo>, %».*, %».+, %.&bar and dozens more variants. Which of those would mean `self` and which would mean a static anon? Or will you now force all static var use to use parens?

[18:10] *** sjoshi left
[18:10] *** markong left
[18:10] <Zoffix> In fact, when $.+foo syntax was being argued for, I said, no don't add it, because then we'll start going insane. And here we are, proposing more things. And how many people used $.+foo syntax? One?

[18:10] <lucasb> I'm suggesting only method-ish calls

[18:10] <Zoffix> lucasb: why the omission then?

[18:11] <Zoffix> This is all special casing: %.<foo> works, but only (as you earlier said) `self` is an Associate and now only with "method-ish" calls, which I don't even know the definition of.

[18:12] <lucasb> currently, %.<foo> always means (%).<foo>

[18:12] <lucasb> currently, $.foo always means $(self.foo)

[18:13] <lucasb> I'm not suggesting *if and only if* classes are Positional, Associative, etc.

[18:13] <El_Che> "it's not just %.<foo>. It'sit's not just %.<foo>. It's also %».<foo>, %».+<foo>, %».*, %».+, %.&bar and dozens more variants" <-- that's what I meant with a big language some days ago :)

[18:13] <lucasb> The syntax should be invariant

[18:14] <Zoffix> mst: would you be able to add a link to our second logger to the /topic of #perl6-dev #moarvm #perl6-toolchain : http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6  or give one of the non-op regulars ops so they could do it themselves?

[18:57] <moritz> IRC logging is a huge privacy nightmare; I might have to stop doing that if the GDPR really hits

[18:59] <masak> :(

[19:00] <masak> moritz: it strikes me that I've had immense use of the IRC logs over the years. mille grazie

[19:01] <moritz> masak: my pleasure. So far I don't have concrete plans to shut them down, but...

[19:02] <moritz> there are so many unsolved problems

[19:02] <moritz> * GDPR requires explicit consent before processing data. Getting consent from every IRC user is simply impossible

[19:02] <moritz> * It's not clear if nick names automatically consistitute personally identifiable information

[19:03] <moritz> * It's not clear to me how to process requests for data removal without destroying the whole context of a conversation

[19:03] <masak> right

[19:04] <moritz> on the plus side, I'm not logging any IP addresses

[19:04] <masak> are you allowed to mark in some way if a conversation has had messages removed?

[19:04] <moritz> I'm pretty sure I do

[19:05] <moritz> so I could replace all removed messages with nickname (removed) and line (removed)

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> I wonder what Matrix folks figured out regarding GDPR and their freenode bridge

[19:05] <moritz> it gets really murky if somebody has messages (partially) bounced off of bots

[19:05] <AlexDaniel> but through that bridge you can't get messages from before you joined the channel

[19:06] <raschipi> I'm not logging any IP addresses --> You're required to do that by Brazillian law, btw

[19:06] <jmerelo> The GDPR could potentially affect even bots

[19:07] <jmerelo> If you somehow log whoever is asking and what they asked... 

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriight

[19:07] <moritz> raschipi: how charming :-)

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> quotable6 actually caches irc logs…

[19:08] <moritz> fwiw on the webserver side I delete the last octet of IPs in the logs

[19:09] <raschipi> But Freenode is the one required, not people that archive the messages.

[19:09] <moritz> (and the last 4 bytes for IPv6 addresses)

[19:09] * masak .oO( we're letting you know that your processing^Wprivacy is important to us )

[19:10] *** comborico1611 joined
[19:10] <raschipi> Anonymity is forbidden by the constitution in Brazil.

[19:11] <moritz> is that why they fought with WhatsApp?

[19:11] <comborico1611> I find it sadly amusing that nations call themselves republics when they don't even pretend to be.  At least in America, we pretend to be a republic.

[19:12] <raschipi> Well, not specifically using the Constitution directly, but the laws implement the constitutional mandate saying they need to point which IP adress said what and when.

[19:13] <raschipi> With the IP number and the timestamp, after a WHOIS, you can go to the ASN and they need to point which customer it came from.

[19:14] <raschipi> s/ASN/AS/

[19:14] <moritz> ... unless there's a NAT inbetween

[19:21] <raschipi> Well, if the ISP keeps the NAT, they need to keep records. If the client has it, that will narrow the investigation to a very small area. And it doesn't deal with a VPN and much less Tor.

[19:23] <raschipi> But most people aren't that sofisticated and they regularly inprison people for what they said on the internet.

[20:37] <timotimo> i don't find it terribly odd

[20:37] <timotimo> you can have a coercive type constraint in the signature, though

[20:37] <timotimo> m: sub got ( Int() $x where ^10) { dd $x } ; got split(/\,/,"2,1")[0] ;

[20:39] <lucasb> not "1" before 0

[20:39] <lucasb> oops, sorry

[20:39] <ktown> in the signature, the right side is an int 

[20:39] <ktown> oooh, where is eq not ==

[20:39] <timotimo> no, where is ~~

[20:41] <timotimo> is it lexicographical sorting that messes this up?

[20:41] <timotimo> m: say "01234567890".comb.grep(45..69)

[20:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «(5 6)␤»

[20:41] <timotimo> looks like

[20:41] <timotimo> that looks a lot like a trap

[20:43] <ktown> i have seen a few example that use $x where ^10 to check an int 0..10, but in a case where I split a string and pass to method it's not happy

[20:44] <timotimo> yeah, it's doing lexicon comparison

[20:44] <timotimo> the numbers have to come after 0 but before 10 in the lexicon, but 10 comes before 2

[20:45] <timotimo> so the only numbers that would fit in ^10 would be 0 and 1

[20:45] <lucasb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Any.pm6#L498-L504

[20:46] <ktown> in p5 it was always clear the operater coerces the arguments

[20:46] <lucasb> before and after always do str comparison 

[20:46] <lucasb> should they have different multis for doing different comparisons?

[20:47] <timotimo> aren't before and after DWIM comparisons?

[20:47] <timotimo> leg and friends always do str comparison

[20:47] <lucasb> well, 'cmp' is Stringy

[20:47] <timotimo> s: &infix:<cmp>, \(1, 2)

[20:47] <SourceBaby> timotimo, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/847d3d60b/src/core/Order.pm6#L46

[20:48] <lucasb> oops, sorry, mixed with Perl 5

[20:48] <timotimo> i was about to say

[20:48] <lucasb> :)

[20:50] <lucasb> I think this multi get selected for this case: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Order.pm6#L10-L13

[20:51] <lucasb> and so, ends up being Stringy comparison

[20:51] <timotimo> s: &infix:<cmp>, \(1, "2")

[20:51] <SourceBaby> timotimo, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/847d3d60b/src/core/Order.pm6#L15

[20:51] *** Kaiepi joined
[20:51] <ktown> is there a numberic version of where in the signature?

[20:51] <timotimo> actually, the two below it, but it comes out the same way

[20:52] <timotimo> you can use the coercion type i showed above

[20:52] <timotimo> m: sub got ( Int() $x where ^10) { dd $x } ; got split(/\,/,"2,1")[0];

[20:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[20:52] <timotimo> this one

[20:53] <ktown> timotimo: yes but that is not obvious from the docs on signatures or the examples

[20:54] <timotimo> "where" uses smartmatch semantics, so you have to search for that

[20:54] <timotimo> if there isn't a link from "where" to "smartmatch" that's worth an issue in the issue tracker

[20:57] * ktown reads https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature again

[20:57] <timotimo> The where clause doesn't need to be a code block, anything on the right of the where-clause will be used to smart-match the argument against it. So you can also write:

[20:57] <timotimo> that's where the link is

[20:58] <timotimo> https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_~~

[20:58] <timotimo> though i'd even say it should link to ACCEPTS instead?

[20:58] <timotimo> huh

[20:58] <timotimo> that only handles ranges overlapping

[20:58] <timotimo> that seems like a major oversight

[20:59] <timotimo> When smart-matching a Range of integers with a Cool (string) the ACCEPTS methods exploits the before and after operators in order to check that the Cool value is overlapping the range:

[20:59] <ktown> down around the "sub can-turn-into" stuff

[21:06] <timotimo> not sure what part of that is relevant here

[21:09] <ktown> in javacript you need parseInt because there is no hint for the coercion. p5 never had that issue. But here I passed a string to an Int comparison and got an error sometimes (0 and 1 are special)

[21:10] <timotimo> smartmatch is not int comparison, it's dwim comparison

[21:10] <ktown> yes...

[21:10] <Kaiepi> i love how you can pretty well do whatever you want with roles https://hastebin.com/cezazuyeja.pl

[21:10] <timotimo> if you want it a different way, you can also have "where 0 <= * < 10

[21:11] <timotimo> " in the signature

[21:11] <timotimo> that will be a numeric comparison and that will work as you expect it to

[21:13] <ktown> yah, that would be the note to add to the docs to force a numeric range comparison the "where ^10" or "where 0..10" did not do what I expected 

[21:15] <ktown> I always thing "10" is a string but 10 is an int but in this case it's not

[21:16] <ktown> *think

[21:16] <timotimo> it is surprising to have string comparison there, yeah

[21:17] *** raschipi joined
[21:17] *** Herby_ left
[21:20] <ktown> m: 10 ~~ "10"

[21:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: ( no output )

[21:20] <ktown> m: say 10 ~~ "10"

[21:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[21:21] <ktown> i'm not completely (just mostly) crazy

[21:23] <raschipi> I don't see why Numeric.ACCEPTS or Range.ACCEPTS can't convert strings to numbers before testing them.

[21:25] *** ChoHag joined
[21:31] <raschipi> They know their own type...

[21:37] <lucasb> Maybe infix:<cmp>(Real, Any) should do numeric comparison and infix:<cmp>(Any, Real) should do string comparison. IOW, do different things depending on the type of the first operand.

[21:37] <lucasb> they way they are now, both do string comparison, regardless of the order of the operands

[21:38] <lucasb> *the way

[21:38] <raschipi> But ~~ doesn't use cmp, does it?

[21:39] <lucasb> iiuc, in this case it does

[21:41] <raschipi> The documentation says they first coerce the arguments to numeric, then do numeric comparisson. If they just call cmp between the operands, that should be pointed out, I think.

[21:42] <raschipi> Then what cmp does is another question, currently it prefers string comparisson as was pointed above. Is it supposed to be a transitive operator?

[21:46] <lucasb> do you mean transitive or symmetric? :)

[21:46] <raschipi> transitive too

[21:47] <Geth> ¦ doc: d0fbecd26c | (Ben Davies)++ | doc/Language/js-nutshell.pod6

[21:47] <Geth> ¦ doc: Fix some redundancy in JS nutshell bitwise operators section

[21:47] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/d0fbecd26c

[21:47] <synopsebot> Link: https://doc.perl6.org/language/js-nutshell

[21:47] <lucasb> hmm, dunno

[21:48] <lucasb> is there a negation/toggle operator for Order values? More->Less, Less->More, Same->Same ?

[21:49] <masak> m: say -More

[21:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «-1␤»

[21:49] <raschipi> Yes, negate it

[21:50] <raschipi> Oh, already answered

[21:51] <lucasb> ok, works, but lost the enum value

[21:51] <lucasb> *type

[21:56] <masak> m: say Order(-More)

[21:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 847d3d60b: OUTPUT: «Less␤»

[21:58] <lucasb> right :)

[21:59] <lucasb> so, I guess I can say that 'cmp' is symmetric in the sense that "A cmp B" is equivalent to "OrderNegation(B cmp A)"

[22:00] <lucasb> if it did different types of comparison depending on the type of the first operand, the above property wouldn't hold true anymore
