[00:38] <Hotkeys> I have a question to which the answer is probably no, but I figured I'd ask: is there a nice way (or a way at all) to hot reload modules for eg. live plugin reloading for an IRC bot

[00:41] <lookatme_q> I think we not have one

[00:49] *** b2gills left
[00:49] <epsilonphase> Do classes in Perl6 have destructors(Or something else that's essentially a cleanup method)?

[00:52] <Hotkeys> iirc DESTROY submethod is called when something is garbage collected

[00:53] <lookatme_q> But should not depend on the GC

[00:53] <epsilonphase> From what I understand, classes aren't guaranteed to be collected when the program exits?

[00:54] <lookatme_q> there is no DESTRUCT currently

[00:55] <epsilonphase> Too bad, that'd have been perfect for that temporary file cleanup.

[00:56] <lookatme_q> you maybe put them in LEAVE or others block

[00:56] <geekosaur> but there should be a phaser for the main file?

[00:56] *** molaf_ left
[00:56] <Hotkeys> you might be able to make use of the END phaser

[00:57] <lookatme_q> epsilonphase, https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#___top

[00:58] <epsilonphase> Well, with weak references, if those exist, I think that could definitely work.

[00:59] <timotimo> we do not currently have weak reference support

[01:06] <epsilonphase> Oh. I guess that trying to make concessions to the language in order to handle it like C++ is probably not productive then. :S

[01:08] <Hotkeys> what're you trying to do?

[01:09] <timotimo> fwiw, things you eval will not stick around forever

[01:09] <timotimo> so maybe that can help

[01:09] <timotimo> will just probably have to work around some built-in caching maybe?

[01:09] <epsilonphase> More or less RAII style cleanup.

[08:07] <masak> so, the perl6/nqp repository has a vulnerability warning...

[08:07] <masak> https://github.com/perl6/nqp

[08:07] <masak> (guess it's only visible if you're logged in, and maybe a contributor)

[08:14] <masak> I'm curious about this comment left in nqp's regex grammar by Mouq in 2013: "XXX Eventually squish termseq and termish and get < || && | & > infixes using by EXPR in nibbler"

[08:14] <masak> I *think* this means that the regexes could be written using an operator precedence parser, like Perl 6 itself is, but right now it's done more recdescent-y

[09:15] <masak> lookatme_q: TCO is one of those things that are a definitive "nice to have" in a language, but it's also typically not something that's added after the fact. (cf JavaScript implementations)

[09:16] <masak> lookatme_q: for starters, how will this interact with (a) giving truthful stack traces, and (b) JIT/on-stack replacement?

[09:17] <masak> my point: it's a neat feature, but it ain't for free, nor does it have zero repercussions on the rest of the language

[10:08] <masak> I'm reading an old Smalltalk tutorial, and it uses an example where Timestamp is a subclass of Date

[10:08] <masak> so it has Date's year, month, dayOfMonth, but it also adds hour, minute, second

[10:08] <masak> apparently there used to be a time where this was considered a good idea

[10:19] *** ZzZombo left
[10:23] <Ulti> not just reuse, also generalisation you can treat a timestamp as a date directly, thats an example of where I see it working well actually because all the methods for a date apply equally well to a datetime but not the other way around

[10:26] <Ulti> also everyone forgets that composition is totally a thing you did with traditional class heirarchy type OO you just had attributes and proxies to achieve the same thing with none of the advantage of types

[10:29] <Ulti> like Java really only fixed the typeness of that paradigm with interfaces, it didnt really make it more convenient like roles/mixins do

[10:57] <samcv> great!

[10:57] <samcv> it seems i may be making a perl6 module that lets you get the git log

[10:58] <jmerelo> samcv: as in, without using the git command?

[10:58] <samcv> well it uses the git command. but it will probably return a perl6 data structure

[10:59] <jmerelo> samcv++

[11:00] <samcv> it doesn't seem to exist yet. i was going to use from-json to make it a perl 6 structure after processing the input to escape things. but i might not do that now hmm

[11:00] <jmerelo> samcv: I did some ad-hoc stuff for my TPF grant, mostly to analyze commits, not exactly log.

[11:01] <samcv> yeah. i need the log's text and the files modified

[11:04] <Summertime> dang, and yeah thats better practice, just was thinking of a quick fix if possible

[11:08] <Summertime> man sometimes I feel like I have a handle on perl6 and then I see more to learn

[11:11] <samcv> what is the best way to create key/value pairs from one array that's keys and one that's values

[11:11] <samcv> i know there's an operator or sub but i can't remember

[11:12] <AlexDaniel> Summertime: it should be something like:  multi method irc-join ($e where .nick eq $nick) { .send: :where<ChanServ>, text => “op {.channel}” }

[11:12] <sena_kun> samcv, Z=>?

[11:12] <samcv> that sounds like it

[11:12] <sena_kun> m: say <one two three> Z=> (1, 2, 3)

[11:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «(one => 1 two => 2 three => 3)␤»

[11:13] <samcv> perfect

[11:13] <sena_kun> `zip (=>) foo bar` looks a bit more familliar for me, on the other hand `Z=>` is less to type. :)

[11:14] <sena_kun> m: say <one two three> >>=><< (1, 2, 3)

[11:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «(one => 1 two => 2 three => 3)␤»

[11:14] <sena_kun> m: say <one two three four> >>=><< (1, 2, 3)

[11:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of infix:«=>» are not of the same length␤left: 4 elements, right: 3 elements␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[11:14] <sena_kun> will give you nice exception when lists have different length, where Z will just omit elements I think.

[11:26] <masak> re https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/QRegex/P6Regex/Grammar.nqp#L164-L165 -- does the p6 regex slang have a "juxtaposition"/"empty infix" operator for concatenation?

[11:26] <masak> (it was in order to answer that question I was looking at the grammar in the first place)

[11:26] <sena_kun> jmerelo, well, in Haskell you have nice >=>, >>>, >>= kind of ops, so... And I am too lazy for nice Unicode `»«` symbols.

[13:11] <masak> moritz: re "you need a specialized EXPR", yes -- I think so too

[13:12] <masak> moritz: I think it comes down to every language/slang choosing what TTIAR should mean. should it be an error, or should it be a juxtaposition operator?

[13:13] <masak> crucially, if it's the latter, then you cannot also have things like `if 2 + 2 == 4 {`, where the TTIAR between the `4` and the `{` signals that the EXPR is over

[13:15] *** sotona left
[13:16] <moritz> also, tokenization can be very dependent on TTIAR behavior

[13:17] <masak> "tokenization"? :)

[13:18] *** abraxxa1 left
[13:18] <masak> you mean that thing that shows up at the beginning of every textbook about compilers, but which I never use because I use Perl 6 grammars? :P

[13:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[13:20] <moritz> well, if you detect two terms in a row, you've identified two substrings as terms

[13:20] <moritz> which lies firmly withing tokenization, even if you don't explicitly think about it that way

[13:21] <moritz> and / <term>+ % <infix> / is a quite different tokenization than / <term>+ /

[13:21] <masak> aye

[13:21] <masak> what the p6regex grammar does currently is basically / <termish>+ /

[13:22] <masak> I dunno, I was tickled about what's basically a TODO comment from 2013 left in the source :)

[13:22] <masak> especially since it suggested migrating things to EXPR when I was out hunting for a juxtaposition operator

[13:22] <moritz> .oO( <termish> is so TimToadyish :D )

[13:22] <masak> it is

[13:23] <masak> I strongly suspect you know this, but it means "term, cushioned in zero or more prefixes and postfixes"

[13:23] <masak> there's also "infixish", which ISTR includes metaop things

[13:24] * masak .oO( masaksplaining )

[13:25] <moritz> I knew it once, at least :-)

[13:28] <masak> m: sub infix:< >($l, $r) { "lol, I'm zero-width" }; "OH " "HAI"

[13:41] <candr> Is there a way to validate if a string is an acceptable path without attemping to create a new file/dir or using a regex? I want to check if a path input by the user is valid, but it may or may not actually create it at a later time.

[13:42] <moritz> candr: on Linux, any string that doesn't contain the zero byte is an acceptable path

[13:43] <moritz> (possibly with a length limitation)

[13:44] <candr> moritz: What if I need it to be OS agnostic? Like on windows it must start with a drive letter etc...

[13:44] <moritz> candr: what does it mean to be OS agnostic?

[13:45] *** sotona left
[13:45] <moritz> candr: does it need to be valid on all OS? or on the current OS? or something else?

[13:46] <candr> moritz: must validate path if on unix or windows or... this program in particular is mainly being used on a windows machine.

[13:46] <moritz> candr: the proper solution to whatever problem you are actually having is probably to come up with a set of rules that are stricter than windows and linux, but present a reasonable subset for the user

[13:48] <moritz> also, strings like "../../etc/hostname" are valid paths, but should usually not be treated as acceptable inputs

[13:48] <moritz> the answer is "it's complicated" :(

[13:48] *** skids joined
[13:49] <candr> moritz: so I am trying to validate user input for a project directory.... we were initially thinking of using a regex to validate the input, but was wondereing if there was a built in method to avoid the added complexity of a regex.

[13:49] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v skids

[13:50] <moritz> the complexity is not in the regex, but in deciding what to allow and what not

[13:52] *** abraxxa left
[13:53] <tyil> candr: you can try to create an empty file at the location, if that succeeds, the path is OK and you can remove the file again

[13:53] *** abraxxa joined
[13:54] <tyil> if you need to create dirs to create the file, dont forget to remove those as well

[13:54] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v abraxxa

[13:54] <tyil> as moritz says, most strings are acceptable paths (at least on GNU+Linux)

[13:54] <moritz> you can perfectly legally create directories that contain an RTL marker, but it's most likely not a good idea

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> m: say "hello\0world".IO

[13:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «Cannot use null character (U+0000) as part of the path␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:55] <tyil> even something like `touch '+[+&][){+&)\'` is ok, and will create a valid file

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> sure, because it *is* a valid filename

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> I don't see a problem

[13:56] <tyil> does IO::Path.new check for validity on windows?

[13:56] <moritz> m: say IO::Path.new('con')

[13:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «IO::Path is disallowed in restricted setting␤  in sub restricted at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 1␤  in method new at src/RESTRICTED.setting line 32␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[13:57] <tyil> interesting

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> stupid restricted setting

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> e: say IO::Path.new('con')

[13:57] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «"con".IO␤»

[13:57] <moritz> it does that just fine, even though "con" is a reserved name on windows

[13:57] <moritz> along with nul and some others

[13:57] <tyil> so I guess just make an IO::Path of the string, and if you want to be super sure, try to create an empty file

[13:57] <moritz> PRN, AUX, COM1, LPT1 etc.

[13:59] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v itaipu

[14:01] <candr> Thank you all for the help. There are definitely some things I did not think about... The problem is both more simple and more complicated that I thought =)

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> another thing to consider is path length

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> for example

[14:02] <AlexDaniel> e: say (‘sandbox/’ ~ "h" x 9999).IO

[14:02] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «"sandbox/hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…»

[14:02] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, Full output: https://gist.github.com/3c30193270ac9f9fe0f21144026cc7ab

[14:02] *** Zalabaslea left
[14:02] <AlexDaniel> so it created a Path object just fine

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> but

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> e: spurt (‘sandbox/’ ~ "h" x 9999).IO, ‘blahblah’

[14:03] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 3117cfd9b: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) Failed to open file /home/bisectable/git/whateverable/sandbox/hhhhhhhhhhhhhh…»

[14:03] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, Full output: https://gist.github.com/ff6c083e93e79324be05290c8ce2de6c

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> candr: so I'm thinking, if it's some sort of a script or a tool for a user, then perhaps there's no need to validate it that much

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> i.e. you asked the user for a path, they gave something. Just trust them and take it, that's totally fine locally

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> but if that's a webservice or something like that, you shouldn't be using user-submitted strings in paths *at all*

[14:06] <moritz> ... or use whitelisting

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> or that, yes

[14:06] <candr> :AlexDaniel Thanks. It is a small application that runs some lab equipment, but it might not be worth validating to that point.... all of the input fields are saved so a crash in the rare case of a path that is too long would't be the end of the world...

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> but then the answer is simple and you just have a..z in the whitelist :)

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> moritz: ok now that I'm thinking about it, it's actually not that simple

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> also have to make sure that it's not too long and not too short (i.e. not empty)

[14:10] <AlexDaniel> so maybe just taking a hash of the input will avoid the need to list all these cases

[14:10] <AlexDaniel> though now you have unreadable filenames :)

[14:11] <moritz> well, validiating that it 1) doesn't exist yet and 2) matches / ^ <[a..z A..Z>]**3..63 $ / isn't too bad :-)

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> moritz: and then the application is installed on windows… :)

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> or even better, *moved* :)

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> though maybe the file manager will complain when moving the files 🤷

[14:19] <AlexDaniel> never tried that

[14:20] <candr> This was an interesting discussion. I think I know why a lot of windows GUI applications have you create _then_ select something like a project directory now =)

[14:21] <moritz> AlexDaniel: try cloning a git repo on windows if it contains the same file with two different casings

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> I don't have a windows machine to try… though that reminds me of the .git folder vulnerability :)

[14:25] <moritz> what I want to say is: it's a mess :-)

[15:22] <SmokeMachine> hi guys! i have a "definition" question to you: Im writing an ORM (Red) for perl6 , but I don't want just map tables/columns to classes/objects... I want to make perl6 "operations" on sql queries, for example: `Customer.all.grep({ .orders.map( *.price ).sum > 1000 })` would be the equivalent of the query of this page: https://ponyorm.com . So, Im not sure it should be called an ORM... I was thinking on LSRM (Language Syntax

[15:22] <SmokeMachine> Relational Mapper). Does that make any sense? Or do I need to tae some rest and do not think on Red for some time? :P

[15:29] *** sotona joined
[15:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sotona

[15:31] <uzl> Hey, #perl6! I'm wondering what's the preferred or recommended way of validating arguments passed to a constructor.

[15:32] <jnthn> Depends how complex the needs are. If the validation is per attribute, consider defining subset types and typing the attributes with them

[15:32] <timotimo> very complex validation can go into TWEAK

[15:32] <TimToady> intermediately, type the named arguments to TWEAK

[15:33] <uzl> However, any validation with TWEAK won't be inherited by the child class, right?

[15:33] <TimToady> it will for those particular arguments

[15:33] <timotimo> TWEAKs from all classes will be run

[15:33] <TimToady> since all the TWEAKs are called

[15:34] *** sotona left
[15:34] <jnthn> Just make sure to write it as submethod TWEAK

[15:34] <TimToady> if you're writing a custom constructor that takes a bunch of similar positionals, then the constructor itself could validate all the elements

[15:34] <TimToady> in short, TMTOWTDI :)

[15:35] * TimToady is back home from TPC, btw, so it massive backlog mode :)

[15:35] <TimToady> *in

[15:35] <uzl> I guess I'd also create a private method to delegate the arguments validation to it and then use it in a modified new constructor?

[15:36] <TimToady> if you want to do it post-bless, sure, you could do that

[15:37] <timotimo> is post-bless a bit like post-haste?

[15:37] <TimToady> but if your subclasses are depending on the validation, it might go better into BUILD or TWEAK

[15:37] <TimToady> (or on the individual attribute type)

[15:38] <TimToady> a subset declaration can call out to random code as well

[15:38] <TimToady> just depends on how often you wanna enforce the invariant

[15:40] <uzl> Wow, so much information! #perl6 truly rocks!

[16:41] <benjikun> What are the grammars in P6 inspired by?

[16:41] <benjikun> anyone know some other similar features in other languages

[16:42] <mst> SmokeMachine: my big issue has been "you can't overload and/&& in perl5 because short-circuit"

[16:42] <SmokeMachine> mst: thanks! :)

[16:42] <mst> benjikun: PEG grammars have been around for a long time, and I*think* the remaining features are inspired by, well, reading up on everything else and stealing the good parts

[16:44] <benjikun> mst: I see

[16:46] <mst> somebody more involved in the design process could probably give a more detailed answer, of course

[18:56] <ufobat> jmerelo, the decoder is.. well, working.. the encoder is missing at all. compress::zstd would be missing. i dont understand the p5 sereal testscases, so some more tests would be awesome as well

[19:13] <ufobat> the reason why i am not using dbic in perl5 is, i have a single process app and i do everything async there with AnyEvent::DBI

[21:48] <Altreus> I don't suppose anyone has a vim fold expression for pod6? I cargo-culted my perl5 one literally 10 years ago and so I have no idea what I'm doing

[21:48] <yoleaux> 16 Aug 2018 22:05Z <tbrowder_> Altreus: can you please file a rakudo issue on the pod6 problem,

[21:49] <yoleaux> 17 Aug 2018 22:11Z <tbrowder_> Altreus: do you have a pod problem other than the declarator/attribute issue?

[21:49] <Altreus> oh

[21:49] <Altreus> yoleaux: tell tbrowder_ No, except I don't think it's as helpful as pod5

[21:49] <Altreus> is that how I do that?

[21:50] <Altreus> hmm

[21:50] <Altreus> maybe they'll see it anyway

[21:51] <avuserow> Altreus, it's ".tell nick some message here"

[21:51] <geekosaur> it's .tell

[21:51] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: to ast to yoleaux to tell something to someone, just say: ' .tell someone something

[21:51] *** pmurias left
[21:52] <SmokeMachine> Altreus: to ast to yoleaux to tell something to someone, just say: `.tell someone something`

[21:52] <SmokeMachine> .tell Altreus thats how you do it

[21:52] <yoleaux> SmokeMachine: I'll pass your message to Altreus.

[21:54] <tbrowder_> Altreus: if you can file an issue giving an example of pod6 input as you understand it, what you get, and what you would like to see, we may be able to do something about your perception,

[21:56] <tbrowder_> Altreus: Damian Conway has a giant vim resource file that has p6 stuff in it. i think it’s publicly available but i don’t have a link handy.
