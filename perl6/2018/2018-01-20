[00:39] <timotimo> tbf, .<abc> is the same length as $<abc>, so maybe i should go with that more often. on the other hand, you can just write $<foo> inside a double-quoted string, whereas you'd have to spell out $_.<foo> for the other thing

[00:41] <timotimo> well, $_<foo> also works

[06:18] <seeg> hello, i just learned about perl6 grammars, they remind me of logstash' grok function: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html

[06:18] *** konsolebox joined
[06:19] <seeg> is it possible in perl6 to combine smaller grammars into a bigger one? i can't find it in the docs

[06:19] <seeg> also this tool for the 'grok' plugin http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ is quite nice as it allows for auto-discovery of the grammar components from raw text, is there something similar in perl6? :)

[06:27] *** Zoffix joined
[06:28] <Zoffix> seeg: yeah, grammars are just classes. You can subclass them or make roles and mix them in

[06:29] <Zoffix> seeg: bottom of this section has a small example of subclassing original "Calculator" grammar and its actions class to add more features to it: https://docs.perl6.org/language/grammars#Proto_regexes

[06:29] <seeg> ah ok great thanks

[06:38] <Xliff_> seeg: I think that "auto-discovery" is the site running through all of its predefined patterns until it finds the first thing that matches.

[06:38] <Xliff_> It would be interesting if it applies some heuristic to determine which match is "best"

[06:40] <seeg> there are many possibilities here i guess, starting from "get first that matches" to something like "get the most optimal one that tries to match the whole string with minimal number of patterns"

[11:01] <Zoffix> \o  Any idea what's the reasoning for `readline` to keep attempting to read from STDIN once EOF is reached? Is it just because C's read() would block (I'm guessing) on TTYs and wait for stuff but not do so for non-TTYs?

[11:01] <Zoffix> Trying to figure out if there's a deeper reason for allow this behaviour; e.g. that in this script you have to press CTRL+D on each loop iteraton: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Attachment/1435362/776537/multi-eof.pl

[11:43] <Nanjizal> Well it says it's immutable but I wanted a mutable structure.  I was experimenting with Haxe Compiler and wondering about implementation of a String for Perl. 

[11:45] <Nanjizal> It seems many base structures of Perl are immutable by design and then they have mutable ones above? 

[11:45] <moritz> the interesting thing about Str is that they are based on grapheme clusters, not on codepoints

[18:26] <BenGoldberg> moritz, Does that mean that you would also expect people on 4chan to be nice and polite, too?

[18:31] <moritz> BenGoldberg: the word "expectation" has several meanings, I think

[18:31] <moritz> BenGoldberg: if you ask me for my predition on how they behave, I'd say "not nice"

[18:32] *** sjoshi left
[18:32] *** Nanjizal left
[18:32] <moritz> BenGoldberg: but when talking about expectation in the sense of social norms, my answer is that they should limit their non-niceness to people who have chosen to be part of that community, not "innocent" strangers

[19:53] <preaction> especially if Perl.com is linking to you as the place to make comments?

[19:55] <preaction> if r/perl is given official status (which it looks like it is), then r/perl is the official face of the community. so, look at your face, community...

[19:55] <moritz> is perl.com in any way official/authorotative?

[19:56] <DrForr> It has a .com in it, so in the minds of people new to the discussion it will be.

[19:56] <preaction> the official announcement says The Perl Foundation is its "custodian"

[19:56] <preaction> https://www.perl.com/article/welcome-back-perl-com/

[19:58] <DrForr> Maybe I should get an account there and add my blog postings, just to see how much traffic I can draw.

[19:58] <preaction> the about page says it's "managed by The Perl Foundation"

[19:59] <preaction> so, not sure how official something can get in Perl-land, but it seems pretty official to me

[20:00] <preaction> i consider Perl.com an opportunity to have a community news / announcement pipeline. but then i realize that the TPC::NA announcement isn't up there and realize that's probably not happening

[20:01] <DrForr> Maybe someone should submit it?

[20:39] <stmuk_> . o O ( I should never publish this blog I'm writing )

[20:45] <dmaestro> I'm having trouble using modules and namespaces. I've read the relevant docs on perl6.org, but haven't found a rule or example  that describes what I'm trying to do. Hoping someone can help me or point me in the right direction.

[20:46] <dmaestro> Example code at https://github.com/dmaestro/p6-packages

[20:47] <dmaestro> I want to share an outer namespace between related modules but get this error: ===SORRY!=== P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol Shared

[20:48] <dmaestro> I'm pretty sure I'm violating some rule about namespacing; but there ought to be a way to do this ...

[23:16] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: 

[23:16] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: In the first example where show_captures is defined, the call to it has also $string as its second argument(line 1937). this is not used in the sub signature.

[23:16] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: 

[23:16] <Geth> ¬¶ doc: Furthermore a small typo on line 1917 (matched instead of match).
