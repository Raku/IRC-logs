[00:00] <jnthn> You can .^lookup the method and, iirc, .cando passed a Capture will give all of the canidates that could match. Then iterate over them and call them. Alternatively, could just put nextsame or callsame at the end of each candidate.

[15:37] <caasih> So is it unwise to learn Perl 6 and then Perl 5? If my final goal is to understand pugs and the diverged moment in my next 5 or 10 years.

[15:39] <moritz> I don't see why you have to learn Perl 5 at all to understand Pugs

[15:40] <El_Che> caasih: do you understand haskell?

[15:42] <caasih> El_Che: I know some haskell. I know some basic type classes like functor and monad. But I can’t understand advanced topics like lenses.

[15:42] <El_Che> pretty much the only thing I remember from pugs was that it was written in haskell

[15:43] <caasih> moritz: Ok. So I just learn to program in Perl 6 first. And I can forget about Perl 5 for now.

[15:43] *** huf joined
[15:43] <caasih> El_Che: I read some dev logs about pugs but I can’t understand junctions at that moment.

[15:45] <caasih> Does Perl 5 have junctions? Why we need them? I didn’t notice them in other languages like C or JS.

[15:45] <moritz> caasih: maybe https://docs.perl6.org/type/Junction.html helps?

[15:45] <El_Che> clarify it a little for me. Are you a haskell afficionado, an Computer Science historian that want to figure how pugs worked? Or do you want to know how Junctions work in Perl 6?

[15:45] <moritz> no, Perl 5 doesn't have them

[15:45] <El_Che> if the latter, the Runtime of Perl 6 is Rakudo now. Pugs was abandoned

[15:45] <moritz> and they are mostly a convience

[15:46] *** zakharyas joined
[15:47] <caasih> El_Che: I think I am the historian in this case.

[15:48] <El_Che> caasih: ok, thx for clarifying

[15:48] <El_Che> there are people around here that worked on pugs and may have some answers

[15:49] <caasih> I may not use high level languages like Perl 6 or Haskell in my career. But I’d like to know stories about them in my free time.

[15:50] <caasih> El_Che++ cool, thanks for the advice.

[15:59] <Voldenet> It isn't unwise to learn perl6 and then perl5, they are different languages

[15:59] <Voldenet> perl6 is a fun toy language

[16:02] <Voldenet> I believe perl5 to be used more in real world environments

[16:02] *** wamba joined
[16:05] <El_Che> Voldenet: of course is Perl 5 more widely used being a popular lang with 30y history. No need to call perl6 a "toy language" though

[16:07] *** lucasb joined
[16:08] <Voldenet> I call that every language that is fun to use

[16:09] <El_Che> a 'it's not you, it's me" thing?

[16:10] <Voldenet> Yeah, 't was meant to be complimentary :P

[16:10] <El_Che> :)

[16:32] <lucasb> Any type object can be coerced to Numeric and they will return integer zero (and emit a warning). Method .Numeric is inherited from Mu.

[16:32] <lucasb> But what about the actual numeric types, can't they overload the .Numeric method to return a value of their type?

[16:32] <lucasb> m: quietly say (.WHAT for +Num, +Rat, +Complex)

[16:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0d39321e: OUTPUT: «((Int) (Int) (Int))␤»

[16:33] <lucasb> wouldn't you like if this ^^ returned ((Num) (Rat) (Complex)) ?

[16:36] <lucasb> the actual values returned would then be (0e0, 0.0, 0+0i) or (NaN, 0.0, 0+0i)

[16:36] <lucasb> any opinions?

[16:40] *** psychoslave left
[16:43] *** troys joined
[16:45] *** Zoffix joined
[16:46] <Zoffix> lucasb: I recall chasing down the "undefined numerics are zero" thing a year or so ago and I recall rage-quitting and wishing we never carried over that feature from Perl 5. I forget the exact details tho.

[16:47] <Zoffix> m: Rat + 1

[16:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0d39321e: OUTPUT: «WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of "+" in expression "Rat + 1" in sink context (line 1)␤Cannot look up attributes in a Rat type object␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[16:47] <Zoffix> That probably was one of them. i.e., sure, you can make Rat.Numeric return <0/1>, but, Numeric isn't always used in operations

[16:49] <Zoffix> m: Int²

[16:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0d39321e: OUTPUT: «Invocant of method 'Bridge' must be an object instance of type 'Int', not a type object of type 'Int'.  Did you forget a '.new'?␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[16:49] <Zoffix> And many operations don't work with type objects, so why do we even have "undef is zero" thing in some random places.

[16:50] <Zoffix> When is it useful?

[16:52] <Zoffix> m: class { method z (Rat $x) { say "Numerator is {.nude.head}" } }.new.z: Rat

[16:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0d39321e: OUTPUT: «No such method 'nude' for invocant of type 'Any'. Did you mean any of these?␤    none␤    note␤␤  in method z at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[16:52] <Zoffix> m: class { method z (Rat $x) { say "Numerator is {$x.nude.head}" } }.new.z: Rat

[16:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0d39321e: OUTPUT: «Cannot look up attributes in a Rat type object␤  in method z at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[16:53] <Zoffix> And there are plenty of custom places where type Numeric objects would explode instead of being coerced to 0. So really, I wish we'd remove this whole idea entirely.

[16:55] <pmurias> Zoffix: do we have a lot of tests depend on that?

[16:56] <Zoffix> I'm about to test it.

[16:57] <timotimo> it looks like state variables in `perl6 -ne` don't behave right

[16:57] <Zoffix> There's also RT#130383

[16:57] <synopsebot> RT#130383 [new]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130383 [BUG] perl6 -n does not set $_ when it's interpolated via a block

[16:58] *** lowbro left
[16:59] <Zoffix> timotimo: what's the code that doesn't work? perl6 -ne 'say $++' and perl6 -ne 'state $x; say $x++' seem to work OK

[17:00] <Zoffix> And RT#130383 is just a mis-scoped QAST::Block

[17:02] <lucasb> Zoffix: I guess I'm not surprised by "undef is zero" in the language. That's a behavior to be expected from a Perl language. I wouldn't mind if it goes away. I was just trying to make the already existent behavior a little more convenient.

[17:03] <Zoffix> lucasb: is it really expected though? I imagine modern practices fatalize those warnings

[17:04] <Zoffix> (`use strictures 2;` doesn't tho)

[17:04] <jnthn> I've had production code survive (desirably) in the case of missing data thanks to that

[17:04] <jnthn> Rather than crash and burn

[17:05] <jnthn> (Which wouldn't have been useful)

[17:05] <jnthn> Certainly I prefer to handle such things explicitly, but sometimes things are unexpectedly missing.

[17:05] <Zoffix> jnthn: I'd say that's pure luck. Had you used any of the ops that expect a :D value on that value, then it'd crash and burn. 

[17:06] <jnthn> Zoffix: I was thinking as much about Perl 5 as Perl 6

[17:06] <Zoffix> pmurias: making Mu.Real and Mu.Numeric return 42 instead of 0 makes these stresstests fail: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/310e04b9ec3821cbacba1d0ff09cbbc6

[17:06] <jnthn> Zoffix: Just saying that I'd lean towards "try to consistently warn and behave well" than "rip it out"

[17:07] <Zoffix> Based on those tests results, it's probably too deeply ingraned to rip out by now

[17:08] <jnthn> Yeah, I consider it a part of the forviging Perl-ish nature, so on that count I'd be hesitant to see it go

[17:08] <Zoffix> Weird a bunch of S32-io/lock.t tests fail too :S

[17:21] <ZzZombo> Ye, I got it, I just didn't read the messages right and thought they still complained about the parentheses.

[17:23] <lucasb> Zoffix: BTW, I appreciate your comment on that issue. I'll try to reply later.

[18:25] <Zoffix> lucasb: and I changed my mind on `num` defaulting to NaN. The fact that unitialized value is true is kinda bad. I think that's the single case of that being so in all of our types.

[18:25] <Zoffix> So +1 on changing it. You now need to convince others :)
