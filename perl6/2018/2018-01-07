[04:04] <kyan> What's the difference between a Match resulting from calling parse() on a grammar, and a inline Pair like this? https://github.com/masak/xml-writer/blob/master/svg-example#L5

[04:04] <kyan> I'm trying to use XML::Writer to print out the parse tree for a string.

[04:05] <kyan> If I just do XML::Writer.serialize($parsed) or XML::Writer.serialize($parsed), it says "The XML tree must have a single root node", even though the grammar match as far as I can tell does only have a single root.

[04:06] <geekosaur> a Match is a very different thing. but using .gist doesn't show you the actual Match

[04:06] <geekosaur> ("say" calls .gist for you)

[04:06] <geekosaur> try explicitly using .perl on it to see what it really looks like

[04:07] <kyan> Oh, that looks *very* different, yeah.

[04:11] <kyan> What is the right way to go about getting my parse tree out into XML?

[04:11] *** cdg joined
[04:12] <geekosaur> that I wouldn't know offhand since I don't know what you are starting with

[04:12] <kyan> calling .tree() on the Match still doesn't seem to be in the same format as the thing in the XML::Writer example

[04:12] <kyan> I'm starting with a Match object.

[04:13] <kyan> (well, at this point of the process. Originally I start with a string and a grammar, then I use the grammar to parse the string, and that gives the Match.)

[04:16] <kyan> If I run "say $parsed.tree;", it prints out a tree that looks like the XML I'd like to get out.

[04:16] <kyan> e.g. https://gist.github.com/ethus3h/7ce684c7d1311c09473d75d849e589ba

[04:16] *** cdg left
[04:19] *** yoleaux left
[04:19] <geekosaur> yes, and that's a bunch of nested Match objects instead of an actual XML tree

[04:20] <geekosaur> not sure offhand how you'd auto-extract that to something useful

[04:20] <kyan> Ah... is there a better way to get XML or a normal tree out of a grammar?

[09:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 880dbfaa1: ( no output )

[09:19] <Zoffix> Is there a way to "eval" a QAST tree in HLL to see what it does?

[09:20] <Zoffix> like above would be like running `die "meow"`; or rather a crash saying can't stringify it, but it'd be die "meow" if you write the missing part right

[14:27] <timotimo> hey, so, off-topic question: i've opened a drive with "cryptsetup luksOpen" and the block device that belongs to it shows up in /dev/mapper, but the individual partition block devices are missing and pvscan and vgchange don't find the pv's in them, unsurprisingly

[14:27] <timotimo> gparted sees the partitions i'm looking for, though

[14:28] <DrForr> linkbait://theperlfisher.blogspot.ro/2018/01/tree-surgery.html

[14:31] <timotimo> ah, partprobe helped. you just gotta give it the devices, too

[14:36] *** eliasr joined
[14:37] *** committable6 joined
[14:37] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v committable6

[14:39] <hahainternet> timotimo: if you are trying to activate partitions of a mapped block device, in general you want kpartx -av and kpartx -dv

[14:39] <hahainternet> depends on how you've set things up

[14:39] <timotimo> i have not heard of that

[14:39] <hahainternet> i use it for storing vm disks inside a single lv

[14:39] <hahainternet> without having to bother with anything special

[14:39] <hahainternet> but yeah, it works with anything that has partition tables and can use mapper

[14:40] <timotimo> what limitation does partprobe have that this can solve?

[14:40] <hahainternet> partprobe just rescans the scsi bus

[14:40] <hahainternet> kpartx gives access to embedded partitions

[14:40] <hahainternet> well, i guess partprobe rescans all storage buses or whatever, i don't know the specifics

[14:40] <timotimo> ah, so with kpartx i wouldn't have had to pass the dev paths

[14:41] <hahainternet> i can't say i've done luks on an entire disk before, so i don't know if i can say

[14:41] <hahainternet> but if you ever have a filesystem in a block device, and want to access a partition

[14:41] <timotimo> i'm a bit disappointed by lvm2 here. i had tried zfs before running into a problem and it was a whole lot faster

[14:41] <hahainternet> use lvm thin partitioning

[14:41] <timotimo> likely because it spread individual files out over multiple disks

[14:41] <hahainternet> yes if you set up a zpool

[14:41] <timotimo> yeah

[14:42] <hahainternet> lvm is just effectively jbod, with thin provisioning now

[14:42] <hahainternet> zfs is millions of dollars of research, but is owned by a predatory company, so i avoid it :(

[14:42] <timotimo> at least zfsonlinux isn't owned by those terrible people

[14:43] <hahainternet> it is, Oracle sued in the US to claim ownership of the organisation of an API

[14:43] <hahainternet> and won

[14:43] <hahainternet> so i would not think open source code makes any real difference

[14:43] <hahainternet> Google only got away through fair use

[14:44] <hahainternet> anyhow just don't tie your company's fortunes to it is all i'm saying :p

[14:44] <timotimo> well, i'm not using it any more anyway, so ...

[14:45] <hahainternet> well hope kpartx helps when you come to need it, time for me to enjoy my sunday, what's left of it

[14:45] <hahainternet> ttyl

[14:45] <timotimo> have fun!

[14:46] <timotimo> my day started waking up far too early, checking on the computer, finding the kernel had bugged inside the nvidia driver and the rsync process had stopped; rebooted into memtest and continued to sleep. then i updated the bios and managed to make my system not boot any more until i removed all pci cards ...

[14:47] <moritz> wow, sounds like a fun start

[14:48] <timotimo> this whole ordeal has been Fun

[14:49] <timotimo> in the middle of my first attempt to move all this data over (about 10 terabytes) i ran into an "unrecoverable error" reported by the sata drive (that i had just bought two days earlier)

[14:49] <hahainternet> timotimo: spinning disks? small files?

[14:49] <hahainternet> use dd instead of rsync

[14:49] <hahainternet> for a start, dd recovers better with conv=noerror / ddrescue

[14:50] <timotimo> can't. the source device is a few terabytes bigger than the target device

[14:50] <timotimo> and many of the files are actually big

[14:50] <hahainternet> move the big sequentially stored files

[14:50] <hahainternet> resize the source filesystem

[14:50] <hahainternet> dd it

[14:50] <hahainternet> i mean this is just for performance

[14:50] <timotimo> i don't think i'm allowed to do that

[14:50] <hahainternet> but once you get to 6 figure numbers of small files

[14:50] <timotimo> the source disks ain't mine

[14:50] <hahainternet> dding becomes significantly faster

[14:50] <hahainternet> ah, damn that is a huge pain

[21:41] <lizmat> hmmm... getting an execution error when trying to upload a distribution to CPAN with "mi6 upload"  :-(

[21:41] <lizmat> 500 Internal Server Error, https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery

[21:42] <timotimo> oh, that's not happy

[21:42] <lizmat> indeed... but I've verified that my .pause file has the correct credentials

[21:42] <lizmat> I think I'll check with Andreas to see what's going on

[21:43] <lizmat> it's not the password, wrong password gives a 401

[21:43] <timotimo> does authenquery do everything, not just signing in?

[21:44] <timotimo> maybe something's wrong about the file to be uploaded

[21:44] <lizmat> yeah, apparently

[21:44] <timotimo> can you make mi6 output what the server has to say to go along with the 500 status code?

[21:46] <lizmat> no debug output in CPAN-Uploader-Tiny

[23:45] <ckraniak> 2 questions

[23:45] <ckraniak> In Nativecall, how does one pass a CStruct by value?

[23:46] <ckraniak> And how does one pass an array of CStructs (array containing values, not refs/pointers)?

[23:47] <timotimo> for the latter, please see the NativeHelpers modules in the ecosystem

[23:47] <timotimo> buggable: eco NativeHelper

[23:47] <buggable> timotimo, Found 3 results: NativeHelpers::CBuffer, NativeHelpers::Blob, NativeHelpers::Array. See https://modules.perl6.org/s/NativeHelper

[23:47] <timotimo> i think one of those does what you want

[23:47] <timotimo> for the former, i'm pretty sure we can't support returning CStruct by value, but i'm not sure about passing CStruct by value.

[23:48] <ckraniak> Let me take a look at that module

[23:49] *** cdg joined
[23:49] <ckraniak> I tried unioning this struct with a uint32 (correct sizeof) and making an array of those

[23:50] <timotimo> in that case you're in luck; you can just nativecast(YourStruct, @buffer[$index]) i think

[23:51] <ckraniak> And the passing struct by Val I declared the signature to have the struct fields and not the struct itself

[23:51] <timotimo> unioning a uint with a struct is problematic, because "has SomeStruct $.blah" makes it a pointer rather than embedded. but perhaps you can "HAS SomeStruct $.blah" and that could work

[23:51] <ckraniak> Yes I used HAS

[23:51] <ckraniak> I think the issue is with the pass by value hack I was trying

[23:52] <ckraniak> Specifically I don't think it packs the same way in a function signature as it does a struct 

[23:53] <ckraniak> It doesn't say it segfaults, but it seems to crash on that line

[23:54] *** cdg left
[23:54] <timotimo> if you have valgrind installed, you can try running your code with perl6-valgrind-m

[23:55] <ckraniak> Isnt valgrind is Unix only?

[23:56] <timotimo> yeah, didn't know you're on windows

[23:57] <ckraniak> Yes, this is WriteConsoleOutput I'm trying to hook

[23:58] <ckraniak> Lemme check Nativehelpers out
