[18:13] <rouking> What's the correct way to pass a hash to a default constructor? e.g. `my ClassWithHash $a .= new: hash-member => %local-hash;`

[18:15] <rouking> Or do I need to construct the class, then fill in the hash?

[18:16] <sena_kun> m: class A { has %.foo; }; my %a = one => 1; say A.new(foo => %a);

[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 430266629: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => {:one(1)})␤»

[18:16] <tobs> m: class CWH { has %.hash-member }; my %local-hash = a => 5, b => 10; my CWH $a .= new: :hash-member(%local-hash); say $a.hash-member

[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 430266629: OUTPUT: «{a => 5, b => 10}␤»

[18:16] <sena_kun> m: class A { has %.foo; }; my %foo = one => 1; say A.new(:%foo);

[18:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 430266629: OUTPUT: «A.new(foo => {:one(1)})␤»

[18:18] <rouking> I must be doing something stupid here

[22:26] <comborico> Can't find the answer to this:  9 / 4 .  nine is the dividend, four is the divisor, 2 is the quotient, and one is the remainder.  But what is it called when you carry the remainder over to as in 2 1/4?

[22:28] <Zoffix> fractional part?

[22:28] <timotimo> maybe "mixed number"?

[22:29] <timotimo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)#Mixed_numbers

[22:32] <comborico> It doesn't have a special name in relation to division?

[22:32] <timotimo> in german it's called the "rest"

[22:33] <lizmat> as it is in Dutch for that matter :-)

[22:34] <lizmat> perhaps "remainder" ?

[22:59] <Todd> Hi All, I am over on https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sprintf.  I can not figure out how to format a real number.  perl6 -e 'my $x="123456"; my $y = sprintf ( <%f2.3>, $x ); say $x;'

[23:00] <Todd> I am looking for 12.3435

[23:00] <Zoffix> Todd: you'd need to divide it beforehand

[23:00] <timotimo> doesn't the f go after the 2.3?

[23:00] <Zoffix> that too

[23:00] <timotimo> m: say sprintf("%2.3f", 12.3456)

[23:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 72b54ddd6: OUTPUT: «12.346␤»

[23:01] <comborico> lizmat: It can't be remainder because the remainder is 1, not 1/4.

[23:01] <Todd> and say $y too

[23:01] <Todd> perl6 -e 'my $x="123456"; my $y = sprintf ( "%2.3f", 12.34567 ); say $y;' Your printf-style directives specify 1 argument, but no argument was supplied   in block <unit> at -e line 1

[23:01] <Zoffix> Todd: and third error is you're calling sprinf with a single argument: a List. You need to remove that space

[23:02] <Zoffix> `sprintf(`  or just ditch the parentheses entirely

[23:02] <Todd> Ah Poop!  Thank you!

[23:02] <Todd> death to paranthsis!

[23:03] <Zoffix> w00t http://rakudo.org/

[23:03] <timotimo> fantastic!

[23:06] <Zoffix> .ask moritz how do you use certbot on www.p6c.org? If I run `sudo certbot` it tells me it's trying to read 0.23.0's config with 0.21.1 certbot, so looks like we got more than one certbot installed?

[23:06] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to moritz.

[23:07] <timotimo> i wonder if something like "alternatives" is involved?

[23:10] <Todd> how do I say this is Perl 6   $y = $x * 1e9

[23:11] <timotimo> $y = $x * 1e9

[23:11] <Todd> perl6 'my $x="123456"; my $y = $x * 1e9; say $y' Could not open my $x="123456"; my $y = $x * 1e9; say $y. Failed to stat file: no such file or directory

[23:12] <Zoffix> Todd: you're missing -e

[23:16] <Zoffix> out of space

[23:17] <Todd> Wrong machine.  Fedora 27.  I am remoted in.

[23:18] <Todd> Speaking of Windows, is there a recent 32 bit perl 6 yet?

[23:18] <Zoffix> No

[23:18] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: yo, you around? The box with the bots is out of diskspace, and I'm not sure what to delete...

[23:19] <timotimo> perhaps there's some core dumps?

[23:19] <Todd> is it a dead project?

[23:20] <timotimo> it's not, it's just that nobody has built one recently

[23:20] <Zoffix> Todd: I wouldn't really call it a "project". It's just no one got a 32 bit windows + volunteer time to build the binaries

[23:20] <Zoffix> They might not even build (I tried a few months ago and failed)

[23:20] <Zoffix> (though it might've been due to other reasons and not that that the box was 32bit)

[23:21] <Zoffix> Don't have access to it anymore

[23:21] <Todd> bugger.  I have to code somethig for Windows 7 32 bit and I really don't want to do it in Perl 5

[23:21] <timotimo> you can build rakudo yourself on windows, though

[23:21] <timotimo> if you have to deploy your app, use the installermaker

[23:22] <Todd> It look over my head

[23:22] <Zoffix> Todd: you could try building from source: https://rakudo.org/files/star/source

[23:22] <Todd> will look

[23:23] <Todd> can I build the 32 bit on a 64 bit platform?  does it have a 32 bit switch?

[23:24] <timotimo> it's likely possible
