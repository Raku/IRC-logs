[17:50] <shinobi-cl> what is the most appropiate value for "Empty" ?

[17:52] *** dct left
[17:52] <moritz> Empty

[17:53] <moritz> depends on what you want, really

[17:53] <moritz> in a list of Int's, the Int type object might be sensible for a missing value

[17:53] <moritz> or a Failure

[18:04] <shinobi-cl> Hmmm... is for a immutable bidimensional array that can have any value (int, Str, other arrays) but where some cells are undefined at creation.

[18:04] <shinobi-cl> i was thinking on using medat-data for indicating this so a query for empty for an undefined cell would return true

[18:04] <shinobi-cl> meta-data*

[18:06] <shinobi-cl> ["A"], [1], [], [2]... say @a[2]:empty; # True 

[18:19] <shinobi-cl> Empty is actually nullifying the element, like it never existed.

[18:22] <stmuk_> if I have "(2,4).Seq" is there any neat way of returning values and a count like ("1:2", "2:4")?
