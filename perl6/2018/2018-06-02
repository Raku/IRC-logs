[08:26] <scovit> this kind of mechanism

[08:26] <scovit> checking if an object can do something

[08:27] <jmerelo> scovit: there's can and cando

[08:27] <jmerelo> scovit: https://docs.perl6.org/routine/cando

[08:33] *** mcmillhj joined
[08:33] <scovit> is there a way to custom the error message of Constrint type check?

[08:35] <scovit> like to something like:  expected "so $g.^can("c")" but got B (B.new)

[08:36] <scovit> also, if I understand correctly, the check is runtime

[08:36] <scovit> yep..

[08:37] *** psychoslave joined
[08:37] *** Schepeers left
[08:37] *** mcmillhj left
[08:37] <scovit> are these kind of checks ever gonna become compile time?

[08:37] <scovit> I am thinking also about Roles

[08:40] *** MilkmanDan left
[08:41] *** MilkmanDan joined
[08:41] <moritz> nominal types are check at compile time, if possible. That applies for roles too

[08:42] <moritz> I don't know if anybody plans to hoist constraint type check to compile time

[08:42] <moritz> you could

[08:44] <jmerelo> scovit: there's an issue for constraint unmet errors https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1883

[08:47] *** mcmillhj joined
[08:49] *** Schepeers joined
[08:52] *** mcmillhj left
[08:55] <scovit> this is runtime:

[08:55] <scovit> m: role Q { }; class A is Q { method c {} }; class B { method d {} }; my $e = A.new(); my $f = B.new(); sub ciao(Q $g) {}; say "we"; ciao($f);

[08:55] <scovit> could be compile time, no?

[09:03] <moritz> could be, though requires some sophisticated analysis

[09:03] <moritz> because $f isn't typed as B

[09:12] <scovit> true, then it would be probably worth it to do it for modules but not for scripts

[09:12] *** lizmat left

[14:06] <MasterDuke> that's the idea, but i don't know what the input will be and i still want it to take a long time

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> oh, then just use zero-width assertion and make sure your regex fails

[14:30] <Summertime> for smartmatching against regex literals, is there any difference between m/something/ and rx/something/?

[15:08] <Summertime> another question that has been stumping me a bit

[15:09] <Summertime> trying to find all 2 element lists with both values the same

[15:09] <Summertime> m: say ((1,1),(1,2),(3,3),(3,7)).grep: {.[0] == .[1]}

[15:10] <Summertime> is what I've got, but having the subscripts there feels a bit off, like I'm doing something wrong

[15:14] <Summertime> perl confuses me more every day

[15:15] <Summertime> I'm guessing @_ causes the input to grep to change, which gives the unexpected extra list

[15:16] <Summertime> but, using [==] $_ worked

[15:17] <Summertime> still have the {} though, but it feels a lot neater now

[15:17] <Summertime> also scalable, which is a bonus for any code golfing :D

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: actually, for testing some single changes, you can also use ｢sake debug:unicodable｣

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> and the bot will join #whateverable channel

[21:27] <AlexDaniel> well, that's fun :)

[21:27] <AlexDaniel> but I have to get some sleep now, and tomorrow I'm away for a trip

[21:28] <AlexDaniel> o/ 🍕

[21:28] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: wow

[21:28] <El_Che> active-active :)

[21:28] <El_Che> lots of pizza for ypu

[21:28] <El_Che> have fun tomorrow!

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: speaking of fun, this is probably one of the coolest contributions from today:

[21:29] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, Using file “heh” as a main file, other files are placed in “sandbox/”

[21:29] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar af645c9f4: OUTPUT: «foo␤bar␤baz␤»

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> but maybe you've seen it already :)

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> interesting, which file did it choose and why?

[21:30] <El_Che> :)

[21:31] *** maia joined
[21:31] <AlexDaniel> I mean, I totally see which file was executed, but why? :)

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> ah: https://github.com/perl6/evalbot/blob/a9ed3caa2bd772adac6ec301b028130963ec1a69/lib/EvalbotExecuter.pm#L91

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> pure luck then :)

[23:16] <kkrev> MasterDuke: I just wanted to play around. Figured I'd mention it here if anyone wants to let the right people know something's broken. This is standard Fedora.

[23:18] *** psychoslave left
[23:19] <MasterDuke> kkrev: how did you get your perl6?

[23:19] <kkrev> MasterDuke: rakudobrew

[23:20] <MasterDuke> kkrev: rakudobrew is mostly discouraged now, unless you really have a need to switch between multiple versions of rakudo

[23:21] <El_Che> kkrev: rakudobrew is a bad match for regular users. Use rakudo-pkg (https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg) or rakudo star

[23:21] <El_Che> (rakudo pkg has fedora repos)

[23:21] <El_Che> (rakudo star compiles a released version locally)

[23:22] <kkrev> OK thanks. I think you have five years of web inertia to fight on rakudobrew. I will try rakudo-pkg now.

[23:23] <El_Che> kkrev: I launched rakudo-pkg because people where complaining about rakudobrew-for-regular-users on this channel :)

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar af645c9f4: OUTPUT: «SetHash(1 3)␤»

[23:36] <kkrev> switched to rakudo-pkg. Another FYI I guess: https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1181607

[23:36] <jnthn> m: my $sh = SetHash.new; dd $sh{2}

[23:36] <yoleaux> 15:32Z <nine> jnthn: So if I'd want to use the multi dispatch machinery to pick between a multi candidate that takes named args and one that doesn't, my best chance is to give the proto a different find_best_dispatchee method. Right?

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar af645c9f4: OUTPUT: «Bool::False␤»

[23:36] <yoleaux> 16:54Z <nine> jnthn: unless you tell me that this is a really bad idea, I'm going to merge it somewhat soon into Inline::Perl5's master: https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/commit/053b8d0c3a9d298cf28bd1c2877de549b82405a8

[23:37] <mscha> Never mind.  $sh{2} = False is defined

[23:37] <jnthn> mscha: SetHash entries produce False by default

[23:37] <jnthn> Right :)

[23:37] <kkrev> I definitely have libffi installed.

[23:38] <MasterDuke> jnthn: while you're thinking about SetHashes, any thoughts on https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1847 ?

[23:40] <MasterDuke> kkrev: ignoring the libffi part (and this is definitely going outside things i know about for sure), but i think linenoise is known to be problematic and readline is recommended if possible

[23:43] <kkrev> MasterDuke: https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1181608

[23:43] <kkrev> readline-devel is installed

[23:43] <El_Che> kkrev: yes, I forked until DrForr has time to fix it

[23:44] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/perl6-readline

[23:44] <jnthn> .tell nine Well, it comes with the same caveats of using any nqp:: ops outside of core, which is that while they're often de facto stable, there's no promises made about them. There's a non-zero chance that the current multi cache mechanism will eventually be subsumed by my work on spesh plugins.

[23:44] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to nine.

[23:44] <El_Che> kkrev: zef install https://github.com/nxadm/perl6-readline.git

[23:44] <El_Che> 1 line patch

[23:45] <El_Che> I opened a ticket for the linenoise and readline perl modules that are broken on some distros

[23:46] <kkrev> OK, thanks, your readline works fine.

[23:46] *** mscha left
[23:47] <El_Che> yeah, the fix works on modern distros with readline 7

[23:47] <El_Che> but not on distros with older readlines, hence no PR

[23:48] <El_Che> it has to do with a wider versioning challenge about versioning of libs and nativecall

[23:49] <jnthn> .tell nine So, effectively, you can commit it, but those ops might at some point go away, so there'd be some updating to do at that point. So long as you're good with that, I'm also ok.

[23:49] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to nine.

[23:49] <El_Che> and since jnthn is taking requests this evening ---^

[23:49] <El_Che> :)

[23:55] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Hm, does that introduce a potentially awkward discontinuity between assigning one set and two sets into a SetHash, where in the first case it flattens away, and in second not?

[23:55] <jnthn> m: say Set ~~ Iterable

[23:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar af645c9f4: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[23:55] <jnthn> We generally consider sets as items

[23:57] <jnthn> El_Che: I'm pretty sure we've people in the community who know better than me on handling native library versioning issues and such. :)

[23:57] <jnthn> El_Che: I already designed one bit of module/versioning infrastructure and haven't heard the end of "oh no sha1s!!!" ever since. :P

[23:57] <MasterDuke> jnthn: ah. think the problem should be solved at the meta-op level?

[23:58] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Potentially, yes

[23:58] <El_Che> jnthn: lol

[23:58] <El_Che> jnthn: full disclosure, I am a sha1 winer :)

[23:59] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I'm pretty sure I agree with the result you're aiming at on assignment meta-ops with SetHash and friends.

[23:59] <jnthn> MasterDuke: I'm just worried about the STORE(Set) way of achieving it, and that probably does mean it wants a META_OP_ASSIGN candidate dedicated to it
