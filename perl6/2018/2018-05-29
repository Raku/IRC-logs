[06:08] <jmerelo> In February the visits were a binary number: one day there was 1, the next 0, the next 1, and so on. Now it's on average 2 questions per day. We're not anywhere near we we should be, but we're improving.

[06:09] <jmerelo> Last 3 months have been the 1, 2nd and 6th with the most questions. 3rd was January after release, 4th August 2017, 5th November.

[07:31] <jmerelo> Mixing roles into callables, the question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50578740/mixing-roles-into-callables

[07:31] <moritz> Summertime: it's complicated :(

[07:34] <moritz> GDPT contains provisions that somebody who processes your data needs to inform you

[07:34] *** zakharyas joined
[07:34] <moritz> so in the strictest interpretation, the editor would need to send an email to whoever they write about as soon as they start taking notes

[07:36] <Summertime> complicated but worthwhile c:, can't imagine trying to implementing it sanely, but... I'm glad I can look at a site that I trust, and understand what they do with things now

[07:56] <AlexDaniel> moritz: I don't think p6weekly deals with personal data

[07:59] *** robertle joined
[07:59] <AlexDaniel> hm I guess you're right

[08:00] *** scimon joined
[08:00] <moritz> jmerelo: correct. That's one of the points critics dislike about GDPR

[08:00] <moritz> afaict, there's no exception for journalistic activities

[08:01] <jmerelo> moritz: hum. But you are not actually "requesting" information (such as email) from that person. That person has published that information in another provider.

[08:02] <moritz> jmerelo: but requestion information from users isn't the sole scope of GDPR

[08:02] <moritz> processing PII is

[08:02] <moritz> *requesting

[08:02] <jmerelo> moritz: I mean, think about someone citing an interview from a newspaper. I think that's covered by other laws (right to rectification, or something like that, I guess... Or the one that allows you to request Google to erase things)

[08:03] * jmerelo just loves the word "requestion"

[08:03] <AlexDaniel> there's also this thing about doing something in the public interest

[08:03] <AlexDaniel> in which case you don't need consent…

[08:04] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right. When you're publishing something, you're just "quoting". It can also be said that you are "notified" by the fact that you can ego-google yourself and find your name.

[11:46] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: you probably have to use brined and salted, not pickled, capers. Also, it's better if you use fresh pasta. There's a nice Italian shop here that prepares it daily.

[11:47] <hahainternet> haha not what i expected to see in this channel

[11:47] <hahainternet> anyone have any recommendations for cooking chorizo? :)

[11:48] *** raschipi joined
[11:49] <jmerelo> hahainternet: I'm Spanish. I probably have nothing else.

[11:50] <tbrowder_> to me the tomatoes were the issue. wife used fresh tomatoes but they tasted too light (not enough body). i sent her the link.

[11:50] <jmerelo> hahainternet: do you want it with pasta, added to chili con carne, in burritos, with lentils, cooked in wine? Fried eggs with chorizo, anyone?

[11:50] <hahainternet> jmerelo: I like an italian cured meat, but the spanish seem to have hit the jackpot

[11:50] <hahainternet> jmerelo: i've made a habit of back bacon and eggs every saturday, but i'm going to try smoking bbq, and this looks intriguing: https://www.farmison.com/pantry/cured-potted-and-preserved/cooking-chorizo

[11:51] <jmerelo> hahainternet: the chili is the key, I guess. It's Spanish paprika.

[11:52] <hahainternet> i should grow some bell peppers i guess

[11:52] <hahainternet> i have some jalapenos just germinated

[11:53] <jmerelo> hahainternet: If it's for BBQ, probably Argentinian chorizo is better. But as long as it's not too dry, you can try anyone

[11:53] <hahainternet> jmerelo: it's for smoking, so 4-5 hours at a low heat, i figure any chorizo should be good as the flavour will diffuse into the meat

[11:53] <jmerelo> hahainternet: you can try and make your own. It's minced meat plus paprika, basically, dried for a time. You can invent jalapeño chorizo :-)

[11:53] <hahainternet> hah, i could burn water so for now i'm happy to buy, but yeah i'd love to get good at this sorta thing

[11:54] <jmerelo> jmerelo: sounds delicious. And I'm too close to cooking. I'll eat everything before it cooks...

[11:54] <jkramer> A friend of mine recently made a habanero soup with chorizo, it was wonderful! <3 You need to love spicy food though, it's basically just lots of habaneros, garlic and some tomatoes :)

[11:54] <jkramer> hahainternet: I can get find the recipe if you're interested

[11:54] <jmerelo> jkramer: sounds mouth-watering and also -burning. Which is kind of paradoxical, but in a nice kind of way.

[11:56] <jkramer> jmerelo: Indeed! I'm not as used to chilis as my friend is (he grows tons of the hottest chilis on his balcony every year) so I was dying during the first bowl of the soup, but then I got accustomed and needed to have 2 more :D

[11:56] <hahainternet> jkramer: no rush at the moment thank you, i already have too long of a list :)

[11:59] <jkramer> It's actually really easy to make. Fry ~10 habaneros and as much garlic as you like in some oil. Then take it out (but keep the oil), then fry diced chorizos in the same oil. Again, take it out but keep the oil. Then fry (uncooked, ie hard) spaghetti in the oil until they're brownish.

[12:00] <jkramer> In the meantime put the habaneros and the garlic with some (sieved) tomatos in a blender, then pour it over the spaghetti, add the chorizos back and boil the spaghetti in the soup.

[12:02] <raschipi> I got really confused for a moment, chouriço (which would be a direct transliteration of chorizo) means blood sausage in Brazilian Portuguese.

[12:02] <jkramer> I forgot what spices to add but I think you don't need much with all the garlic, habaneros and salty chorizos. :) I'm sure there were some fresh herbs in there though, maybe parsley. Serve with some avocado slices and half a lime that you can squeeze in if you like it fruity

[12:10] <tbrowder_> jjmerelo: if you’re having strange doc issues i’ve found a pod bug that may be the cause. master rakudo is passing all pod tests in spite of the bug...investigating.

[12:12] <tbrowder_> er, false alarm...i forgot about no need for a return statement since last sub value is used as implicit return—whew!

[12:14] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: not really. I was checking to see if your PR was in the latest release to proceed and close the issues in Pod::To::Html and perl6/doc

[12:15] <jmerelo> There's some stuff that's kind of problematic with writing the documentation: knowing what is spec and what's not. I'm checking out Iterable, for instance. Apparently, only the 'iterator' method is.

[12:15] <tbrowder_> i don’t think fix is in latest release

[12:16] <jmerelo> But you have to look up, one by one, the rest of the methods (BAGIFY or MIXIFY) in roast to find that out. It would really help if there was some documentation added to methods saying "Don't look for this in roast, it's a Rakudo thing" (or some compactified thing to that effect)

[12:16] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: hope it makes it into the next one...

[12:16] <raschipi> jmerelo: You can do it the other way around. Send pull requests to ROAST and doc at the same time.

[12:16] <lizmat> BAGGIFY / MIXIFY are supposed to be internal methods

[12:17] <jmerelo> raschipi: roast is not to blame, I guess.

[15:28] <jmerelo> raschipi: there's already a page for the nativetypes, so just a single issue would be needed if so.

[15:29] <jmerelo> I mean an issue... https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1512

[15:29] *** athenot left
[15:30] *** skids left
[15:30] <jmerelo> There are a couple of pages that could be added there too, but I have preferred not to to be able to close it. One is the page on "independent" routines (which I just started) and another one on statement prefixes 

[15:30] <jmerelo> And maybe pragmas, which is out there too...

[15:36] <jmerelo> raschipi: last one is kind of similar to #1518...

[15:36] <raschipi> You get two for one, then.

[15:37] <jmerelo> raschipi: and besides, that one should be closed, I guess, since exit is already moved to the new page

[17:04] <jmerelo> [Coke]: Long term it would be interesting to group line-oriented and full-document oriented tests. That will also speed them up a bit. 

[17:05] <jmerelo> [Coke]: but long term also, this would be interesting https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1952: sharing Pod6 caches.

[17:05] <jmerelo> [Coke]: right now, they are used only by Pod::To::Bigpage

[17:06] <jmerelo> [Coke]: it's an under-documented feature of CompUnits, but I was thinking about creating a Pod::Shareable module, spin it off, and use it from here. 

[17:06] <jmerelo> [Coke]: the way it's been done now, we're interpreting every page 3-4 times when testing. That's not too efficiente.

[17:32] <jmerelo> [Coke]: maybe it was left because make html is only done in some cases, and is not needed for generating the web pages.

[17:32] <[Coke]> ? make html is how the web pages are generated, no?

[17:32] <[Coke]> (it's just another way to call htmlify)

[17:33] <jmerelo> [Coke]: right. I mean whatever target runs make1bigpage (or whatever). I'm not too sharp right now.

[17:33] <jmerelo> [Coke]: I don't know, anyway. Maybe it was done so at some point in the past, but I haven't seen that.

[17:40] <[Coke]> thanks for fixing the long-present aspell bug

[17:40] <jmerelo> [Coke]: no problem. My pleasure. Thanks for saying that, I appreciate :-)

[17:41] <jmerelo> [Coke]: long term maybe we should move to hunspell, anyway... 

[17:42] <[Coke]> I only picked aspell because it was there.

[17:42] <[Coke]> not tied to it.

[17:43] <jmerelo> [Coke]: the main problem now is converting the dictionary if possible. It shouldn't be hard, but I tried that and it failed. Anyway, if it's working now, no need to fix it.

[17:44] <jmerelo> [Coke]: long term solution also would be to have a Pod::Test::Spelling which skips code and some other things... And at this point it starts to look like yak shaving, so let's leave it like that.

[17:45] <uzl> Hi to everybody!

[17:46] <uzl> I was wondering if there was a way to get information (in a manpage style) about a function/method from the Perl 6 REPL.

[17:46] <jmerelo> uzl: Hi! Yep, there's p6doc. not exactly the same.

[17:47] <jmerelo> uzl: and in fact, that's precisely what it doesn't do https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1088

[17:48] <jmerelo> uzl: so you'll have to make do with the web search, I'm afraid. Maybe we could make p6doc include an API to the web... or read the JS which implements search or whatever.

[17:48] *** Sgeo_ joined
[17:50] <uzl> jmerelo: Yeah, I use p6doc from time to time.

[17:50] <uzl> jmerelo: it just happens that I was fiddling with R the other day and found this feature kind of neat.

[17:51] *** Sgeo__ left
[17:51] <[Coke]> There was a thought at one point that .WHY would do this, but it's a lot of data to shove into the runtime atm.

[17:52] <jmerelo> uzl: well, as [Coke] says, you have that but only if you call .WHY from a program and only if that particular feature is documented. AFAIR, you can't call p6doc on a module function that will, in turn, call WHY

[17:53] <jmerelo> uzl: would be nice to have.

[17:54] <jmerelo> Another mixins/iterable question in StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50590224/cannot-assign-to-immutable-value-when-trying-to-assign-to-a-string-role

[17:54] <uzl> [Coke]: jmerelo: Oh, it makes sense!

[17:57] <uzl> jmerelo: hopefully the community can cook up something similar in the near future!

[17:58] <jmerelo> uzl: you can always open an issue. p6doc is part of the perl6/doc repo. Or comment in the issue opened by [Coke] I have linked above.

[18:15] *** [particle] joined
[18:16] *** zakharyas joined
[18:16] <raschipi> kjk: ls probably sent the error message to standard error, while you captured standard output.

[18:22] <Zoffix> s/as/at/;

[18:22] <kjk> ok will do.

[18:23] <moritz> iirc there are known bugs with merge

[18:23] <Zoffix> kjk: just doing `:$out, :err($out)` will probably do the job in the meantime.

[18:23] <Zoffix> moritz: IIRC they were fixed during Proc refactor

[18:25] <moritz> Zoffix: ah nice, wasn't aware of that

[18:25] <kjk> Zoffix: that works! thanks

[18:27] <Zoffix> Briefly scanning the code, looks like the pipe-to-IO::Pipe option is handled in the same conditional tree as merge, and merge comes first. Should be a simple fix.

[18:27] <Zoffix> The merge being handled here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Proc.pm6#L51-L62 while piping is up here, in the `else` branch from merge: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Proc.pm6#L90-L92
