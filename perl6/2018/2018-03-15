[00:56] <rouking> Is there any way I could make a Supply backed by $*IN.lines? I want a Supply variable that is either backed by a socket or STDIN depending on the situation

[01:01] *** cognominal left
[01:01] <rouking> Essentially I want a command-parsing loop that's unaware of the source of its input

[01:01] <rouking> If there is any better way of going about that, I'm open to suggestions

[15:57] <cfa> bumping my question from yesterday: "i notice for ClassHOW and EnumHOW we don't document new, new_type (and EnumHOW doesn't document its compose method); is this intentional?"

[16:11] <moritz> cfa: not intentional

[16:11] <moritz> the MOP is vast, and my feeble attempts to document it have only covered a very small portion of it

[16:12] <cfa> i'll send a pr in a few with last night's drafts
