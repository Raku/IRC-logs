[00:14] <tbrowder> Zoffix: that module was renamed Net::IP so i could tag it CPAN5 for lizmat’s butterfly effort. i am happy to remove the *Lite version.

[00:14] <yoleaux> 22 Feb 2018 23:42Z <Zoffix> tbrowder: build log shows your cpan://id/T/TB/TBROWDER/Perl6/Net-IP-Lite-Perl6-1.0.1.meta having invalid JSON in its meta file. Was that ever meant to be a valid module? If not, you should delete it from PAUSE https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=delete_files

[02:38] <galactus6x> hello. 

[02:38] <galactus6x> i have some questions about the use of perl6

[02:39] <galactus6x> i am a bit weary of the python evangelicals. i want to use perl as my scripting and glue language. 

[02:40] *** mcmillhj joined
[02:40] <galactus6x> does anyone know what i can do with perl6? as far as data science. i want to use it along with R.

[02:43] <MasterDuke> galactus6x: well, perl 6 doesn't anything quite like numpy or scipy yet, but yeah, it's a good scripting/glue language

[02:43] <MasterDuke> NativeCall makes it easy to call C/C++ libs

[02:43] <galactus6x> thanks! 

[02:44] <MasterDuke> have you used python much?

[02:44] <galactus6x> i am currently debating what to use either python or R and I just am fed up with always being told to use python. 

[02:45] *** mcmillhj left
[02:45] <galactus6x> perl6 looks intriguing. 

[02:45] <galactus6x> do you use python MasterDuke?

[02:47] <MasterDuke> no, but the docs do have a "from python" section. https://docs.perl6.org/language/py-nutshell

[02:47] *** Zoffix joined
[02:47] *** ilbot3 left
[02:47] <galactus6x> i guess, if python is the better language for that purpose then fine, it is just that i am used to learning C and the indenting i find odd. 

[02:47] <Zoffix> galactus6x: no idea about data sciencing, but you could flip through the available modules: http://modules.perl6.org/search/

[02:47] <yoleaux> 02:24Z <tbrowder> Zoffix: i have "deleted" all Net::IP::Lite files from CPAN.

[02:49] <Zoffix> galactus6x: you'll likely find more modules in that area for our sister language, Perl 5, on https://metacpan.org/ (thought you can use many of them in Perl 6 via Inline::Perl5 https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Inline::Perl5:github )

[02:49] <Zoffix> There's also Inline::Python; dunno how good it is

[02:49] <Zoffix> eco: Inline::Python

[02:50] <buggable> Zoffix, Inline::Python 'Use Python code and libraries in a Perl 6 program': https:\\/\\/github.com\\/niner\\/Inline-Python

[02:50] <Zoffix> uhh.. buggable, what's with the weird escapeage :o

[02:50] <Zoffix> https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python

[02:51] <galactus6x> i think that would be slower and clunkier. but i may be wrong. 

[02:52] <Zoffix> galactus6x: yeah, speed ain't the game we're good at yet. We've had our first release in just December 2015. (Python was in 1991 by comparison). They had a lot more time optimizing stuff :) Perl 5 should have decent speed, or you could use Python directly. Though I know what you mean about indenting... I never grew on me either :)

[02:52] *** mcmillhj joined
[02:53] <Zoffix> s/I/It/;

[02:53] <galactus6x> i am currently going through the perl6 book Think Perl6. 

[02:53] <Zoffix> Ah, cool.

[02:54] <galactus6x> i am going to throw in and stick with Perl6. i can also learn R for data science.

[02:54] <Zoffix> \o/

[02:55] <galactus6x> i am still trying to find my place in programming. ;)

[02:58] <galactus6x> thanks for your help Zoffix. hey, how well does perl6 work with Catalyst or Dancer?

[03:00] *** mcmillhj left
[03:01] <Zoffix> galactus6x: you'd need to use Inline::Perl5 for them. There's these slides from presentation by the author of Inline::Perl5 and there are a few Catalyst slides (starting with 36): http://niner.name/talks/Web%20development%20and%20Perl%206/Web%20development%20and%20Perl%206.pdf

[03:01] <Zoffix> galactus6x: I think a year and a half ago, the lead dev of Catalyst was trying it out married with Perl 6 and they didn't have a huge amount of luck.

[03:02] <galactus6x> will it always have to be an inline? or does it matter?

[03:03] <Zoffix> galactus6x: it'd always have to be that module, yeah. Perl 5 and Perl 6 are different languages. But code itself it's not as in strings with code. Once you load the module, the stuff mostly looks and behaves like normal.

[03:04] <galactus6x> okay. thank you for all the help.

[03:05] <Zoffix> buggable the bot actually uses Inline::Perl5. It got this Perl 5 code: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable/blob/master/lib5/Buggable/CPANUploads.pm  that it loads here: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable/blob/master/lib/Buggable/Plugin/CPANUploads.pm6#L6 and here it loads it just as if it were a Perl 6 class:

[03:05] <Zoffix> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable/blob/master/lib/Buggable/Plugin/CPANUploads.pm6#L9 and using hashrefs from Perl 5 land as if they were normal Perl 6 hashes here: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-buggable/blob/master/lib/Buggable/Plugin/CPANUploads.pm6#L26-L27

[03:06] *** syntaxman joined
[03:06] *** galactus6x left
[03:07] <Zoffix> (it's not always that smooth going tho... I wrote that Perl 5 module because IIRC I had trouble writing the code it has directly in Perl 6, via Inline::Perl5. It was easier to just write a Perl 5 module with a single class and method and load that instead)

[11:02] <jkramer> AlexDaniel: I played around a bit with that bot restart feature of yours and found an easier and faster way to trigger a restart that doesn't require a full upgrade. ;) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1554#issuecomment-367978291

[11:02] <jkramer> Hope that helps

[11:03] *** SyrupThinker left
[11:03] <AlexDaniel> well, there *is* a killall command: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/177b77cb2ebc045736b8e7a1cf6eb8e25fdce7b6/Sakefile#L40

[11:04] *** mcmillhj joined
[11:05] <AlexDaniel> but I don't know if it works or not because ｢rakudobrew build moar｣ is so much more handy because it does two useful things at once :D

[11:06] *** zakharyas left
[11:06] <jkramer> Yup, it actually is kind of a nice feature if you know about it :)

[11:07] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: ↑ is it actually safe? I recall you were saying that something can go wrong if you do that

[11:07] <jkramer> If someone accidentally removes it, I suggest adding `pkill -9 perl6` or something like that at the and of `make install` in case people rely on the feature

[11:09] * teatime notes that on many non-linux unixes, killall does not do what you want; not sure if those are supported platforms or not

[11:11] <jkramer> I think pkill is more common than killall.

[11:12] *** astj joined
[11:12] <jkramer> Just run both to be safe :)

[20:15] <bdmatatu> p6: class A does Associative { }; my %a = A.new;

[20:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: OUTPUT: «Odd number of elements found where hash initializer expected:␤Only saw: A.new␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:15] <bdmatatu> I was confused by this ... should I be able to use a sigil to make a new A as long as it does Associative?

[20:19] <moritz> bdmatatu: yes, but you need to bind to the variable

[20:19] <moritz> m: class A does Associative { }; my %a := A.new

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: ( no output )

[20:19] <bdmatatu> oh, cool

[20:19] <moritz> m: class A does Associative { }; my %a is A;

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: ( no output )

[20:19] <moritz> also works

[20:19] <moritz> m: class A does Associative { }; my %a is A .= new()

[20:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: OUTPUT: «Cannot modify an immutable A (A.new)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:20] <moritz> m: class A does Associative { }; my %a is A; say %a.defined

[20:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[20:20] <moritz> m: class A does Associative { }; my %a is A; say %a.defined; say %a.^name

[20:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: OUTPUT: «True␤A␤»

[20:21] <bdmatatu> What does 'is' do in that context?

[20:23] <moritz> it specifies the container type

[20:24] <bdmatatu> neat, thanks

[20:25] *** Zoffix joined
[20:26] <Zoffix> The "Cannot modify an immutable" is a bug, isn't it?

[20:26] <Zoffix> Wonder if it's just a too-strict check that the `is` thing ain't a Set/Bag/Mix type

[20:27] *** lucasb joined
[20:28] <Zoffix> Oh wait no, it just wants method STORE or something don't it?

[20:28] <Zoffix> m: class A is Associative { method STORE(|) { say "storing" } }; my %a is A .= new()

[20:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar : OUTPUT: «Cannot allocate memory»

[20:28] <Zoffix> Yeah, \o/ no bugs

[20:28] <Zoffix> m: class A is Associative { method STORE(|) { say "storing" } }; my %a is A .= new()

[20:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 748d1a57b: OUTPUT: «storing␤»
