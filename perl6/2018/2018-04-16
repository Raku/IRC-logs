[15:44] <jmerelo> At least it can be a fast check of the t/*, which are the most usual problems

[15:44] <jmerelo> It should save 4 minutes more, I think, as soon as it's cached, so we might have early results of tests in less than 4 minutes.

[15:45] <Zoffix> jeckyhl: here, stick it somewhere at the top of your program: for Str, IO::Path { with .^lookup: 'IO' { .wrap: -> \p { IO::Path.new: (p ~~ Str ?? p !! p.absolute).encode("latin1").decode: "utf8-c8" } } }

[21:24] <samcv> hello

[21:25] <El_Che> lizmat: the link of jjmerelo's tweet is weird: "Understanding Repo Dynamics by ."

[21:26] <samcv> MoarVM: i fixed libtommath building on solaris (got changed upstreamed too), fixed a problem building moarvm on 32-bit solaris; fixed a problem with Configure.pl on solaris (nqp/rakudo)

[21:28] <Zoffix> lizmat: would you mind changing "please contact Zoffix Znet" to "please see blog post for details: https://rakudo.party/post/WANTED-Perl-6-Historical-Items " ?

[21:28] <samcv> El_Che: the reason i fixed solaris was while i was testing my MoarVM pr on all platforms https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/841 since it depends on platform specific random functions on os's that support them

[21:28] <Zoffix> I kinda lurk in the shadows and I imagine most people don't know how to contact me and it's better if they commit history items directly to repo.

[21:28] <samcv> which was a pain in the BUTT

[21:28] <samcv> and finding all the C define's for determining OS version, and finding what os version these commands were added to, researching whether they blocked or not, testing on every platform etc

[21:29] <El_Che> samcv: did you build it with gcc or SunStudio?

[21:29] <samcv> gcc

[21:29] <El_Che> ok

[21:29] <samcv> well i followed solaris's instructions

[21:29] <El_Che> it used to be the wrong answer

[21:29] <El_Che> but nowadays it's the better choice

[21:30] <samcv> and on solaris had to fix a problem compiling on 32bit with cflags

[21:30] *** robertle joined
[21:30] <El_Che> so, If I try to build 2018.04, the changes will be included?

[21:30] <samcv> which was annoying. we pass -U_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 so we get access to large files on 32 bit

[21:31] <samcv> but one of our libraries includes libelf from solaris which basically puts in a die condition if that is defined to something not our arch

[21:31] <samcv> which i guess makes sense, since that section of the codebase can't access large files since it's 32bit arch. but annoying that solaris dies there

[21:32] <El_Che> (I used to do a lot of Solaris infra, then Oracle happened, moved to a job without Solaris and the opensource solaris project I helped with their Perl (5) packages is kind of in coma)

[21:32] <Zoffix> lizmat++ # thanks :)

[21:32] <lizmat> Zoffix: yw

[21:33] <samcv> so disabled -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS by setting -U_FILE_OFFSET_BITS to negate the flag. which is okay since on solaris 64 bit that flag being passed is not needed at all after researching for a while

[23:53] <samcv> for k trials and N buckets and x is the maximum number of things allowed in the bucket

[23:54] <Zoffix> samcv: how did you come up with 46.1?

[23:54] <samcv> and we multiple the two complex fractions by N becuase there's N buckets, otherwise we'd be getting probability for only one bucket. and we multiply everything by 2, because we want to know if it's 10 items or greater,

[23:54] <samcv> i just plugged in numbers. i could get wolfram alpha to solve for it though

[23:54] <Zoffix> samcv: and the 0.50 result it shows, what does that represent?

[23:54] <samcv> i think multiplying by 2 makes sense. it makes things match reality. because without the 2 it should jus ttell us how many buckets have exactly 10. but we want 10 or more

[23:54] <samcv> 50 % chance

[23:55] <Zoffix> 50% chance that at least one bucket fills after 46.1 trials?
