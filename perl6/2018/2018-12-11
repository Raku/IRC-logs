[00:01] <zengargoyle> i think there might be a module (or if not some code from the forrest fire thing) that may use ANSI escapes and such, but that's all in the +x+y area.  guess the easy way is to just translate the points into positive space.

[00:01] <zengargoyle> sorta thought somebody might have already done that.

[00:03] <holyghost> zengargoyle : maybe use zef search or write us your module :-)

[00:04] <holyghost> you can put it on github

[00:04] <holyghost> the syntax of the repo is Zengargoylemodule-submodule

[00:05] <holyghost> for zengargoylemoulde::submodule

[00:05] <holyghost> with capital etters though

[00:05] <zengargoyle> i've written p6 modules in the past.  (not sure what's changed in the procedure in the past couple of years).

[00:07] <holyghost> if this sounds familiar : you need a README.md, LICENSE lib and t dir and a META.JSON

[00:07] <holyghost> that's your top dir

[00:07] <zengargoyle> i really need to catch up on the docs and such... evidently zef is still the module-thing of choice.

[00:07] <holyghost> indeed

[00:07] <zengargoyle> yeah, i have modules in the ecosystem.

[00:08] <zengargoyle> pre cpan support

[00:08] <zengargoyle> and i hope they still work (should test them)

[00:08] <holyghost> well AFAIK most people publish on github

[00:08] <holyghost> cpan is for working stuff

[00:09] <zengargoyle> but i'm sure things have changed a bit in the past couple of years so starting up is probably a bit of trying to find the latest information.

[00:09] <zengargoyle> and hanging out here long enough to catch up.

[00:09] *** w_richard_w joined
[00:09] <holyghost> ok

[00:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v w_richard_w

[00:11] <holyghost> zengargoyle : the perl6 Advent and google should give you enough information

[00:11] <holyghost> the docs are updated daily in a cron job

[00:12] <holyghost> for p6.c

[00:13] <zengargoyle> oh, i thought p6.d had arrived at some point.

[00:13] <holyghost> also

[00:14] <holyghost> anyway, all kinds of modules are welcome

[00:15] <zengargoyle> yeah.  i've been avoiding modules just because i'm doing Advent of Code and trying to keep things really simple and like 'all in one script' sort of solutions.

[00:16] <holyghost> ok, OOP is the way to go of course

[00:16] <zengargoyle> and not even using classes or anything else really fancy.  but the problems may be getting complicated enough to just start 'use'ing things.

[00:17] <zengargoyle> and there's a slight battle over speed of implementations.... the C person seems to always win on execution time. :)

[00:17] <holyghost> the debugger should tell what you can use or not, by default it's use Zen::Module::Filename

[00:17] <holyghost> :-)

[00:19] <holyghost> zengargoyle : to follow on, you need to read the class docs on perl6.org

[00:19] <timotimo> zengargoyle: have you had a look at Terminal::Print?

[00:19] <holyghost> ah

[00:19] <zengargoyle> i will now

[00:21] *** kurahaupo left
[00:27] <zengargoyle> timotimo++

[00:28] <zengargoyle> looks good. transform points into screenable space and let Terminal::Print just blit them.

[00:31] <holyghost> zengargoyle : do not forget to use OOP from time to time

[00:32] <zengargoyle> i think by the 25th if the problems get more complicated (or as i remember my p6) i'll start to get fancy with the  p6 feature set...

[00:33] <zengargoyle> i'm already sneaking in Z and X and >>op<< type stuff. :)

[00:33] <zengargoyle> haven't yet got to $x₁ type stuff.

[00:35] <zengargoyle> but i did cut one solution's runtime in about half by sprinkling 'int' around.

[00:49] <timotimo> holyghost: opening up MarkovChain.pm6 i see three problems already; "undef" isn't a thing in perl6, "new Foo(...)" isn't a thing in perl6, using "<>" like that is also a compile time error, and "push (.timedata, $v)" is actually calling push with just one argument: a list of .timedata and $v, so that also won't work

[00:49] <holyghost> can you PR ?

[00:51] <timotimo> just about to go to bed now

[00:51] <holyghost> ok then I'll fix myself

[00:52] <timotimo> there's also a wrong "new Time(...)" and "push (.foo, $bar)" in AbstractMarkovChain.pm6

[00:59] <Juerd> MasterDuke: I run Net::MQTT's regex unit test, and it was at 5.7 seconds for a while. Now it's >7 :(

[01:00] <Juerd> This is Rakudo version 2018.11 built on MoarVM version 2018.11

[01:05] <timotimo> with a perf map, it could be, you'll have to manually figure out which frames belong to the new mast compiler, though

[01:06] <Juerd> timotimo: Most of it isn't EVAL though

[01:06] <Juerd> timotimo: Is /<$regex>/ a form of eval?

[01:08] <timotimo> yes

[01:10] <MasterDuke> timotimo: i was just thinking maybe some new functions would show up toward the top of a perf report with the recent rakudo that weren't there before

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> is that the issue we're talking about?

[01:50] <AlexDaniel> a bit noisy but noticeable

[01:50] <zengargoyle> oh, did i run into something other than the .Int -ing of input?

[01:50] <Juerd> AlexDaniel: I don't know whether that's the only problem there though :)

[01:51] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: the parent of a41c37c89f was definitely faster

[01:51] <Juerd> Maybe it went from 5.7 to 5.8 to 6.1 to 6.8 to 7, maybe it was a single commit. If you understand what I mean.

[01:59] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: soo… this is weird…

[02:00] <Juerd> How do you determine which commits to use?

[02:00] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: using bisectable

[02:01] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: foo^ is just the parent of foo

[02:01] <Juerd> Ah, right

[02:01] <Juerd> Why the parent?

[02:01] <AlexDaniel> (this one I bisected privately, but still)

[02:01] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: this way we can see the performance before and after that commit

[02:01] <zengargoyle> is mi6 still the module/project tool?

[08:38] <daotoad> Howdy folks.

[08:39] <daotoad> I finally got my act together and have an article for the advent calendar ready.  Since I was delinquent, it isn't due until the 17th. 

[08:40] <daotoad> Which is nice, because I can ask for feedback: https://gist.github.com/daotoad/47bcbc6f1dc066fff982a72481c6bcd2

[08:40] *** dakkar joined
[08:41] <daotoad> And it also means there isn't a huge hurry to do the Wordpressery necessary to publish it.

[08:41] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dakkar

[08:52] <daotoad> Although if @moritz, or @jmerelo or any of the other Advent-mins are handy, I could use the account setup.

[08:52] <Ulti> daotoad: I can probably add you

[08:53] <daotoad> Sweet.

[08:53] <Ulti> have you got a wordpress account?

[08:53] <daotoad> Not that I know of.

[08:57] <daotoad> Mischief managed!  

[08:57] <jmerelo> daotoad: get a Wordpress account and Ulti or myself can add you there.

[08:58] <jmerelo> Anyway, as I said, I don't see either the draft or the finished article for tomorrow. So if it's ready, that might be you...

[08:59] <jmerelo> Ah, OK, you're in already.

[09:00] <jmerelo> daotoad: I see some problem with the code. Can you precede it with ```perl6 to have it highlighted?

[09:01] <jmerelo> daotoad: I would also post the final script somewhere else and link it from the article; much better that way. A gist or repo would do.

[09:01] *** CindyLinz left
[09:01] <jmerelo> daotoad: I see it's nicely documented :-)

[09:01] <daotoad> Easy enough.  Thanks for the feedback.

[09:02] <daotoad> If I hadn't been sick and useless for 2 days, you wouldn't have had to shuffle days around.  Sorry about that.

[09:02] <daotoad> Bad planning on my part.

[09:03] <jmerelo> daotoad: No problem, we finally managed. You can't plan for sickness. Glad you feel better now.

[09:04] <jmerelo> daotoad: also, as I've said (repeatedly) we don't have confirmation for tomorrow's article, so it would be extremely helpful if you uploaded it as a draft today and give us premission to publish it tonight for the 12th if needed.

[09:05] <daotoad> I can do the edits around noon US Pacific time, GMT-7, i think.  I am on my last legs.

[09:06] <daotoad> You have my permission to publish it all under same terms as perl.

[09:06] <daotoad> And if I get hit by a train, you can even pull it from the gist, make the edits and call yourself a co-author.

[09:06] <jmerelo> daotoad: :-)

[09:06] <jmerelo> jmerelo: I call myself a co-pusher :-)

[09:07] *** CindyLinz joined
[09:07] <jmerelo> daotoad: anyway, don't worry then. Tomorrow early in the morning, if there's some problem, and as long as I've got your permission, I'll publish it if drafted or edit it if still in the gist.

[09:07] <daotoad> The original version of the article was written from the perspective of a new hire at the hot startup, catpix.io

[09:07] <jmerelo> :-)

[09:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v CindyLinz

[09:08] <jmerelo> Take rest now and recover completely :-)

[09:08] <daotoad> Excellent.  If I run into any issues I'll check here for help, but otherwise, I'll have it edited and ready for you in around 12 hours.

[09:08] <jmerelo> Great :-)

[09:09] <daotoad> Thanks and good localtime!

[09:09] <jmerelo> You too :-) It's early morning here in sunny (but a bit chill) Granada, Spain.

[09:09] <jmerelo> (Spanish early morning, I mean. 10:09) ((Early morning is until you take your second coffee...))

[09:10] <daotoad> There much work there for wanna-be expat Americans who speak terrible Spanish with a mostly Mexican accent?

[09:10] <El_Che> South Spanish chill

[09:10] <El_Che> 15 C or something

[09:10] <El_Che>  ;)

[09:11] <daotoad> That's 59 in Amurican.

[09:12] <jmerelo> daotoad: not too bad, actually. Lots of companies hiring under this initiative: https://www.ongranada.com/ Many international companies, continuous job fairs...

[15:45] <presiden> so, I followed upgrading perl6 in https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew#upgrading-your-perl-6-implementation

[15:45] <tadzik> uh-oh :)

[15:46] <presiden> but it seems that: perl6 --version, still outputting 2015.3

[15:46] <presiden> even tho, I see that it install moar 2018.11

[15:46] <tadzik> what does 'which perl6' tell you?

[15:47] <presiden> tadzik, ~/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6

[15:48] <tadzik> sounds good then,  hmm

[15:48] <tadzik> presiden: does 'rakudobrew rehash' help?

[15:49] <presiden> rakdobrew list list two version

[15:49] <tadzik> ah!@

[15:49] <tadzik> and does what 'rakudobrew current' show?

[15:49] <tadzik> er, what does*

[15:50] <presiden> Currently running moar-2015.12

[15:50] <tadzik> there's the problem :)

[15:50] <presiden> the other that on the list is moar-master

[15:50] <tadzik> 'rakudobrew switch' should fix it

[15:51] *** holyghost left
[15:53] <presiden> ah, I guess it pin at certain version of moar instead of the one on moar-master

[16:01] <kirisame> Hello! I just compiled rakudo 2018.11 so that I could use 6.d, but it seems that no `zef` is included with that when I compile?

[16:02] <El_Che> kirisame: zef is not part of rakudo

[16:02] <El_Che> you need to install it 

[16:02] <El_Che> kirisame: what OS are you running?

[16:03] <kirisame> Ubuntu, but that's odd because zef came with both 2018.04 and 2018.10 when I check...

[16:03] <El_Che> you can find install instructions here: https://github.com/ugexe/zef

[16:03] *** st_elmo joined
[16:03] <El_Che> of you can this repo for ubuntu packages : https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[16:03] <El_Che> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#debian-and-ubuntu

[16:04] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v st_elmo

[16:04] <kirisame> when I run `which zef`, it returns ~/perl6/share/perl6/site/bin/zef which is a symlink to ~/rakudo-star-2018.10/install

[16:04] <kirisame> so I assumed it came from there

[16:04] <El_Che> oh Rakudo Star

[16:04] <El_Che> that distribution does indeed include zef

[16:04] <kirisame> rakudo != rakudo star?

[16:04] <El_Che> rakudo star == rakudo and some modules

[16:05] <kirisame> I see what I've misunderstood now, rakudo 2018.11 has been released, but not rakudo star 2018.11

[16:05] <Altreus> oh you're here

[16:05] <Altreus> I was going to ask for you but you're doing it

[16:05] <El_Che> star follows a 3 monthly cyclus. I don't know if it includes .d

[16:05] <kirisame> thanks for clearing that up :)

[16:06] <El_Che> the packages I pointed to have .d

[16:06] <kirisame> 2018.10 is the last release of star, so I assume 2019.01 will have 6.d

[16:06] <El_Che> (they follow rakudo release, hence monthly)

[16:07] <Altreus> huh, I've normally been wary of using debs but this time it might actually be a good idea

[16:07] <El_Che> Rakudo Star is in a transition (probably new maintainer). I don't know when they will release or if the frequency will change.

[16:07] <El_Che> Altreus: I build them, so you know who to hit

[16:07] <El_Che> (they are built by travis, checksum can be found on the travis logs. You get what you see, no magic sause)

[16:08] <kirisame> Altreus: I guess I'll just wait until the next release of star to see if our library works on 6.d :)

[16:09] <Altreus> kirisame: just use the debs because El_Che has foolishly accepted responsibility

[16:10] <El_Che> kirisame: test them on your CI infra (or Travis): https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#using-rakudo-pkg-on-travis

[16:11] <Altreus> ci infra? us?

[16:11] <kirisame> hah

[16:11] <Altreus> kirisame: wouldn't it be funny if shuppet had one before opus

[16:12] <kirisame> I highly suspect we will have CI before they do

[16:12] <Altreus> considering it's probably just docker run travis

[16:12] <kirisame> travis is proprietary, jenkins for us :)

[16:13] <kirisame> i shudder a little every time I think about jenkins

[16:13] <El_Che> we use jenkins at work

[16:13] <El_Che> it's ok

[16:14] <El_Che> once you've written a good collection of pipelines it's pretty plug and play

[16:34] <SmokeMachine> moritz: do you know if wordpress is on UTC?

[16:34] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: I set it back to Madrid time

[16:34] <jmerelo> Or forward

[16:35] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: so, what is 0 UTC in madrid time?

[16:36] <jmerelo> One hour less, I would say

[16:36] <SmokeMachine> I mean: what time should I put to my post be published?

[16:36] <jmerelo> 00:01 Madrid time

[16:36] <jmerelo> But one hour or two later is not a problem either.

[16:36] <SmokeMachine> so I must publish my post at 20th 11:00pm?

[16:37] <jmerelo> 11 pm where?

[16:37] <jmerelo> You can schedule it

[16:37] <moritz> SmokeMachine: what time zone are you in?

[16:37] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: yes, that's my question... what time should I schedule it?

[16:37] <SmokeMachine> is wordpress on the user's timezone?

[16:38] <jmerelo> I think that the WordPress interface does not show a different time based on your own... it just shows a single time. On _that time_ on the server, 00:01 of the say you're assigned.

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> yes, so if the wordpress server is stetted to use UTC, than I should set to 00:00... but is it on UTC?

[16:39] <SmokeMachine> moritz: Im on brazilian timezone +3:00, I think...

[16:39] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: just set it to 00:01 in whatever time is on Wordpress

[16:40] <moritz> SmokeMachine: just put 00:01 in

[16:40] <SmokeMachine> ok then!

[16:41] <SmokeMachine> you guys that speek english much better than me: what is a better way to say this: "As a bonus, let's see what's the track Red wants to follow. This is a current working code:" ?

[16:42] <jmerelo> Looks OK. I might say "This is a work in progress", but other that that, it looks good.

[16:42] <abraxxa> sena_kun: thanks for the genmon xfce plugin pointer, was the quickest way to do it and already works like a charm ;)

[16:42] <sena_kun> abraxxa++

[16:42] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: thanks!

[16:42] <jmerelo> maybe let's check out instead of let's see

[16:43] <jmerelo> or maybe "let's check the track Red is going to follow", or will follow.

[16:43] *** rindolf left
[16:43] <jmerelo> But That's just a matter of preference. If you think it's better that way, so be it.

[16:43] <abraxxa> that's the third perl 6 script on my notebook for such little things, the other two are show-menu which opens the pdf of the canteen in the default browser (they name the file different every week) and the monthly time tracking

[16:44] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: by "This is a current working code" I mean that if you run the following code, it'll work...

[16:45] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: "This is a work in progress" won't mean that the code doesn't work yet?

[16:46] <jmerelo> SmokeMachine: as I say, it's fine. WRT to code, it's always a work in progress, and it's always (more or less) working. So... 

[16:46] <jmerelo> It depends on what you want to convey, the fact that it's not totally finished or the fact that you can run it. Either way is fine.

[16:46] <SmokeMachine> jmerelo: ok, thanks!

[16:50] <matze_> i have already in lwp

[16:50] <matze_> *it

[16:51] <sena_kun> matze_, I think, cro version would be longer... or, _might_ be longer.

[16:52] <sena_kun> matze_, give me a minute, please...

[16:52] <matze_> yes, but i would like to see cro running with this :)

[16:52] *** aindilis joined
[16:53] <sena_kun> ah, then ok... is there a particular thing you are having issues with looking at docs or you just want an example?

[16:53] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aindilis

[16:54] <jmerelo> matze_: you want a server for that?

[16:54] *** robertle joined
[16:54] <matze_> no

[16:55] <jmerelo> If you want to make that request in Perl 6, you can simply use HTTP::Agent

[16:55] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v robertle

[16:55] <matze_> i have added two of my trys to the paste

[16:55] <jmerelo> matze_: see for instance this: https://github.com/JJ/azure-cli/blob/master/code/Perl6/get-locations.p6

[16:55] <matze_> i also checked the multipart section of the documentation

[16:55] <jmerelo> matze_: it's not exactly what you are looking for, but it sets the headers, interprets results, and all the stuff.

[16:56] <matze_> as i said, i have it already running using LWP :)

[16:56] <jmerelo> matze_: also: use StackOverflow, where you might get more (and better) answers... 

[16:56] <matze_> i just would like to know how solve this with cro

[16:57] <jmerelo> matze_: but Cro is server-side. If you want to request from an API, you'd use HTTP::UserAgent. 

[16:57] <sena_kun> jmerelo, Cro can do client part too. :)

[16:57] <jmerelo> sena_kun: I just saw that: https://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-client#Setting_the_request_body

[16:58] <jmerelo> sena_kun: Cro does everything :-)

[16:58] <sena_kun> jmerelo, see Cro::HTTP::Client.

[16:58] <sena_kun> well, Client is "just a Server, but other way around", so... It was too tempting to write that. :]

[16:58] *** molaf left
[16:58] <jmerelo> sena_kun: and it's asynchronous. Cool. HTTP::UserAgent does not do that. Thanks!

[16:58] *** st_elmo left
[16:59] <matze_> sena_kun: i tried all the samples :/

[16:59] <jmerelo> sena_kun, matze_ anyway, syntax is pretty much the same. Set the headers, add the content...

[16:59] <jmerelo> matze_: what was the error?

[16:59] *** abraxxa left
[16:59] <sena_kun> matze_, I think, something like https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/ca2c8cef7529fb522cab0a515b412937 will do.

[17:00] <sena_kun> if not, please provide an error message or something, so we could help or create a bug ticket.

[17:01] <matze_> its not an error but i receive an 503 exception from the server and the http request doesnt looks the same like with LWP or curl on shell

[17:02] <jmerelo> matze_: 5xx means usually "Something's wrong, it's not your fault"

[17:02] <sena_kun> matze_, 503 is quite interesting...

[17:03] <Xliff> sena_kun/matze_: You should pass user and password via auth option.

[17:03] <Xliff> auth => { username => $user, password => $password }

[17:04] <sena_kun> Xliff, does curl set Authorization?

[17:04] <Xliff> oh. That was json! My bad.

[17:04] <sena_kun> looks so, yes. np.

[17:04] <jmerelo> But 503 is service unavailable. I don't thing it's got anything to do with the client... 

[17:05] <jmerelo> I mean, in general 5xx is not the client's fault.

[17:05] <jmerelo> 4xx, that's _your_ fault.

[17:05] <sena_kun> I wonder if something is wrong because of https. Though responding with 503 will be really odd.

[17:05] <matze_> in curl i use -d option..with is pretty much the same as submitting form data

[17:05] <jmerelo> sena_kun: might happen in Heroku, for instance. 

[17:06] <Xliff> matze_: Yes, but your curl request is sending JSON, not form-encoding.

[17:06] <sena_kun> iirc, a form is passed with `-f`, but I cannot guarantee, as I am not a curl persion...

[17:06] <lucasb> .oO( A persian! )

[17:06] <sena_kun> matze_, can you please check if client works for you at all? You can do a get request to some site, just replace `post` with `get` and remove body/content-encoding, maybe `google.com` or something will be enough to check.

[17:07] <lizmat> jmerelo: re pod in setting: in the parrot days size of code to be parsed was more or less dependent on the total size, not the number of uncommented lines

[17:07] <lizmat> so there was little point in documenting in pod: it would only slow down compilation of setting

[17:07] <lizmat> and that was already slow enough in those days

[17:08] <matze_> sena_kun: it does the same in this case @curl

[17:08] <lizmat> nowadays, I think allowing for multiple implementations is really the reason not to document in pod in the setting

[17:08] <jmerelo> sena_kun: He can do that, but he can also check why the server is returning 503, which has little to do with the client.

[17:08] <matze_> yes, i can do get requests (also with ssl)

[17:08] <jmerelo> lizmat: you're following up on the discussion in Twitter.

[17:08] *** Ven`` joined
[17:08] *** domidumont left
[17:08] <lizmat> jmerelo: yeah, I'm not on Twitter :-)

[17:09] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven``

[17:09] <matze_> jmerelo: the server is fine..he geives me the right answer when i use curl on shell or the LWP lib 

[17:09] <jmerelo> lizmat: so what you're saying is that documentation was not included initially as a design decision, to speed compilation up, right?

[17:10] <lizmat> wouldn't call it a "design" decision, rather more a practical one  :-)

[17:10] <lizmat> but yeah

[17:10] <sena_kun> matze_, then, I think, something is wrong with our request. can you check the server, or it is outside of your authority?

[17:10] <jmerelo> lizmat: and that eventually became a frozen accident, which was retconned into not doing it because of the possible multiple implementations...

[17:11] <sena_kun> matze_, "check the server" as in "check what it gets in curl and Cro cases".

[17:11] *** ErhardtMundt19 joined
[17:11] <matze_> its outside of my authority

[17:11] *** ErhardtMundt19 left
[17:11] <sena_kun> matze_, give me a minute, please...

[17:11] <jmerelo> matze_: but anyway, 503 is "service unavailable". Why is it unavailable with Cro and not with the others?

[17:11] <Xliff> Probably the use of the pem file?

[17:11] <sena_kun> jmerelo, something is wrong with request formed.

[17:12] * sena_kun assumes pem file was used.

[17:12] <jmerelo> sena_kun: but that would return either 403 forbidden or 401 unauthorized. 503 is issued, for instance, when there are many requests or something like that. Or you've exhausted free requests.

[17:13] *** Ven`` left
[17:13] <jmerelo> sena_kun: normally it will also give a reason, like "too many megabytes"

[17:13] <matze_> it shows me an maintenance site

[17:13] <matze_> https://account-api-test.icann.org/api/authenticate/

[17:14] <jmerelo> matze_: that's exactly one of the reasons why 503 is returned, because a site it's in maintenance. Once again, not Cro's fault. Maybe it switched into maintenance mode when you started using Cro.

[17:14] <sena_kun> jmerelo, in a perfect world - yes, sure. but if it consistently replies ok to curl, but returns 503 to cro, I won't believe my eyes. :) As in, errors do not always give us what really happened, unfortunately.

[17:15] <matze_> jmerelo: but with curl i receive an answer :)

[17:15] <sena_kun> maintainence page says that GET requests are not allowed, hence 405. if POST with curl work -> that is "our" fault.

[17:15] <matze_> so this is some weird handling by the serve ri promise

[17:16] <matze_> this is the api doc if you like to see: https://github.com/icann/czds-api-client-java/blob/master/docs/ICANN_CZDS_api.pdf 

[17:17] <matze_> there is a curl sample, which is working

[17:17] <jmerelo> matze_: it does not even list 503 as a possible error... 

[17:18] <matze_> its ICANN :D

[17:18] <sena_kun> I am trying to check it myself, but firstly I need to find where my system pem file is...

[17:18] <matze_> so dont worry

[17:18] <matze_> here is a sample in python https://github.com/icann/czds-api-client-python/blob/master/do_authentication.py

[17:18] <matze_> this is exactly what i like to do with cro

[17:19] <jmerelo> matze_: why don't you try StackOverflow? There might be some people there more familiar with Cro (you can tag it with Cro), that particular REST API, and the world at large

[17:20] <jmerelo> plus, we need more questions (and answers) in StackOverflow.

[17:20] <sena_kun> huh, I am getting 503 too... let's try to trace it...

[17:21] <matze_> i got alway a solution and good hints here, but your statemant makes sense

[17:22] *** ferreira joined
[17:22] <sena_kun> well, so what I have found out

[17:23] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ferreira

[17:33] <matze_> because of your wrong set of user/pass?

[17:33] <timotimo> Xliff: sup?

[17:34] <sena_kun> mephinet, 401 one? yup, it returns 401 because of a wrong set, the issue I am talking about is why 503 is returned to Cro. :S

[17:35] <matze_> yep

[17:35] <sena_kun> it might be not so quick to resolve, so I'll look into it later. hence the issue to not forget about this case.

[18:02] <tobs`> I want to get the number of elements from a finite supply. Can I expect Supply.list.elems not to cache the values itself?

[18:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «[6 7 8]␤»

[18:08] <[Coke]> tobs`: why not use .elems on the Supply itself?

[18:09] <Xliff> m: my @foo = 1, 2, 3; @foo »+=» (5, 1); say @foo

[18:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «[6 3 8]␤»

[18:11] <tobs`> [Coke]: because that turns into .elems.tail.wait if I want to get just the number. I was hoping for something which is as short as the task is easy.

[19:16] <jmerelo> daotoad: we do have tomorrow's article ready on the site, so you're back to 17th :-) Thanks anyway

[19:16] <lizmat> lucasb: the reason is that (20..10).minmax is on Range

[19:16] *** sivoais left
[19:16] <lucasb> agreed :)

[19:16] <lizmat> [20..10] is on an Array, that has flattened the range (into an empty array)

[19:16] <lizmat> m: dd [].minmax

[19:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «Inf..-Inf␤»

[19:17] <lizmat> m: dd ().minmax

[19:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «Inf..-Inf␤»

[19:17] <lizmat> I guess -Inf..Inf is the equivalent of NaN

[19:19] <lucasb> Range.minmax is more like Rational.nude that returns it's 2 fields. not similar to List.minmax

[19:20] <lucasb> m: dd (10..20).minmax, [10..20].minmax

[19:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «(10, 20)␤10..20␤»

[19:21] <lizmat> lucasb: but [20..10] is empty

[19:21] <lizmat> m: dd [20...10]

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «Array element = [20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10]␤»

[19:21] <lizmat> m: dd [20...10].minmax

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «10..20␤»

[19:22] <lizmat> note the use of ... instead of ..

[19:23] *** pecastro joined
[19:23] <Xliff> m: [20..10].minmax.say

[19:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «Inf..-Inf␤»

[19:23] <Xliff> m: [20...10].minmax.say

[19:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «10..20␤»

[19:24] <Xliff> m: [30, 50, 20, 85, 6].minmax.say

[19:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «6..85␤»

[19:25] <lucasb> All I'm saying is that the names "min" and "max" are Range's attributes, while in the context of lists, they are list operations. So their usage/behavior/results are different. 

[19:26] <lizmat> lucasb: no, you should consider the Range flattened for .minmax

[19:26] <lucasb> This is unfortunate apparent inconsistency is because of choosing those names for the Range attributes

[19:27] <lizmat> the semantics are the same: produce a Range with the smallest / largest value

[19:27] <lucasb> m: dd (20..10).minmax

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 011c6f11d: OUTPUT: «(20, 10)␤»

[19:27] <lizmat> ah, good point

[19:27] <lizmat> hmmmm....

[19:28] <lucasb> Did you noticed that (10..20).minmax returns (10, 20) and [10..20].minmax returns 10..20 ? That's why I compared Range.minmax with Rational.nude. Do you disagree with that?

[19:29] * lizmat is unsure now of the intended semantics

[19:29] <lucasb> .min, .max and .minmax for lists is for finding the numeric values

[19:29] <lucasb> .min, .max and .minmax for ranges is for getting their attributes

[19:30] <lizmat> that's not so according to documentationn

[19:30] <lizmat> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Range#method_minmax

[19:30] <lizmat> lucasb: in any case, this is worth an issue  :-)

[19:31] <Xliff> If you have «class A is repr('CPointer') { }», and «sub create_a() returns A is native»; what's the best way to instantiate A?

[19:32] *** sivoais joined

[20:16] *** sivoais left
[20:18] *** st_elmo joined
[20:19] <lucasb> Yes, I could argue it should return a Range object (maybe itself even :) to match List.minmax, instead of returning a 2-element list

[20:22] *** sivoais joined
[20:22] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sivoais

[20:23] <lizmat> because it returns a 2 elem List, it looks like it was trying to mimic the List.minmax semantics

[20:23] <lizmat> otherwise it would have just returned self

[20:23] *** sivoais left
[20:24] *** st_elmo left
[20:24] <lucasb> I rather think it (may be) trying to mimic Pair.kv, Rational.nude, Complex.reals semantics, in returning a 2-elem lists

[21:06] <sena_kun> tools/p6advent-md2html.p6 <- personally, I am using this script, you need to replace a link to your gist in sources, then `perl6 foo.p6 go` and that'll generate advent.html. Then you paste it in HTML editor of wordpress and schedule it.

[21:06] <sena_kun> daotoad, please ask me if there are any questions. :)

[21:07] <daotoad> Oh, I see.  Yeah.  I just did that conversion and it seems to have worked fine.  Now I am trying to figure out where to upload the HTML.  I suppose the best thing is just to paste it.  I just hate that in the modern world I get to be the pipe character.

[21:08] <daotoad> The hubris of assuming I want to use their editor.

[21:11] <daotoad> What should I set for the title?

[21:13] <sena_kun> well, there is no specific pattern, but, I think' `Day $day - $yourtopic` is the common one.

[21:13] <lizmat> Day 12 - ....
