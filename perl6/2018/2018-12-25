[06:01] <Xliff> Merry Christmas!

[06:01] <Xliff> Can someone tell me why I get the following error from zef?

[06:01] <Xliff> ===> Searching for: RandomColor

[06:01] <Xliff> Enabled extracting backends [git path tar p5tar unzip] don't understand /home/cbwood/.zef/tmp/1545717544.13956.8648/p6-RandomColor

[06:01] <Xliff> You may need to configure one of the following backends, or install its underlying software - [psunzip]

[06:26] <no-n> is 2 GB of RAM enough to build rakudo? I tried with 1 but it failed.

[06:27] <AlexDaniel> no-n: hmm, any reason why you can't use a prebuilt package? What's your OS?

[06:29] <no-n> Ubuntu 16.04

[06:29] <no-n> but apt-get gets me 2015.11

[06:30] <no-n> I'm stuck on this OS because of my VPS provider :p

[06:30] <AlexDaniel> huggable: deb

[06:30] <huggable> AlexDaniel, Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu Rakudo packages: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#rakudo-pkg

[06:31] <no-n> ahh. thanks =)

[06:34] <no-n> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#debian-and-ubuntu -> E: Unable to locate package rakudo-pkg

[06:37] <no-n> AlexDaniel: ^

[06:38] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: ↑ any idea?

[06:38] *** i1nfusion left
[06:39] <AlexDaniel> no-n: what's going to work for sure is if you download a deb manually and install it https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases

[06:39] <AlexDaniel> but it's weird that the recommended way does not work…

[06:39] <no-n> ok

[06:46] <Xliff> hythm_: Working on the issues you sent. Thanks, a lot!

[06:46] <no-n> ok, cool. that worked for 2018.11 Ubuntu 16.04 2018.12 seems to be missing from that list.

[06:51] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: there's rakudo-pkg-Ubuntu16.04_2018.12-01_amd64.deb.sha1 but no deb itself :D

[06:52] <hythm_> Thank you Xliff.

[06:54] <no-n> just out of interest, is 2 GB enough RAM to build rakudo?

[06:55] <no-n> ahh, rakudo site says 1.5

[06:56] <AlexDaniel> no-n: yeah, it should be enough, I think

[07:00] <Xliff> hythm_: Check your issues. I did a few minor changes on the project and also on your examples. Both are now included in my test cases.

[07:07] <lookatme_q> Xliff, I got that error on windows when my git is broken :)

[07:08] <Xliff> lookatme_q: Hrm. I know that is not the case here, since I am using git and it's working! :)

[07:10] <lookatme_q> Xliff, okay 

[07:10] <Xliff> So is RandomColor properly added to the ecosystem or did I miss something?

[08:03] <Woodi> hi today :)

[08:03] <Woodi> en-joy merry Christmas everyone !

[08:10] *** rindolf joined
[08:11] <Woodi> no-n: if you got old OS you should probably upgrade it just after power up, just: apt-get update; apt-get upgrade   If you set to 'stable' branch and don't have huge amount of packages yet installed it should be quick...

[08:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v rindolf

[08:12] <no-n> how do you set to stable?

[08:14] <Woodi> no-n: assuming Debian: put into /etc/apt/preferences: Package: *\nPin: release o=Debian,a=stable\nPin-Priority: 900\n

[08:15] <Woodi> change 900 into max of other pin priorities

[08:16] <Woodi> pmurias: I think rakudo.js could have internet endiannes, same as IBM systems probably

[08:23] <Woodi> there was "empty core in Perl6" meme... maybe i mis-imagined what it should be but curently imo we have loooots of things available without "use". not saying what is what but maybe some think could be factored as modules in Linux ? :)

[09:31] <Ulti> at the moment whats the best plan for providing the native deps for a native wrapper library?

[09:32] <Ulti> my current one is to create a submodule with what I want to support in /src/<dep_name> and deal with everything myself and essentially build the library myself

[09:35] <Ulti> anyone know if zef or the way p6 modules in general are meant to behave is friendly to submodules?

[09:36] *** scovit left
[09:40] <Ulti> maybe a subtree is better... 

[09:58] <Woodi> Ulti: probably best is to build native lib as a system shared/static library :)  if provided stuff in lib is usefull it could have separate life from module...
