[11:55] <kensanata> I'm writing routes for this Cro application and I would like to invoke a certain action only if the hash of query parameters has a key matching a particular regular expression. Something like 'my %h where .keys.grep: /rollback/; %h = foo => "rollback"; say %h' (which doesn't work) so that I can write "get -> 'diff', $id, :%params where .keys.grep: /rollback/ { ...}". Ideas?

[11:57] <kensanata> The reason why I need this stupid construction is that I am trying to solve a UI puzzle. Here's an example: https://oddmuse.org/wiki?action=history;id=About;username=foo Basically the rollback button is nested inside a form for the diff radiobuttons.

[11:57] <kensanata> Thus, the alternative to an answer to my Perl 6 question would be an answer to my UI design problem, haha.

[11:58] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: Hi! https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/wiki/SQUASHathon

[11:58] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: I'm just thinking that oddmuse6 can participate for sure :)

[11:59] <kensanata> Haha. I've applied for a CPAN account twice, now, and never gotten a reply.

[11:59] <AlexDaniel> don't need a CPAN account for that

[12:00] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't have to be in the ecosystem, as long as you intend it to be there eventually :)

[12:01] <sena_kun> kensanata, by "invoke a certain action" you mean firing a handler, right? Why not make it succeed on url you want(without key presence check), and in the body of handler you can write something like `if $my-condition { do-something; } else { not-found }`. Of course, `not-found` may be a different error.

[12:02] *** ChoHag joined
[12:02] <sena_kun> that'd be effectively the same if I understood you correctly.

[12:02] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ChoHag

[12:03] <kensanata> sena_kun: Yeah, that's right. I'll do that. I was trying to learn more about these pesky constraints, though. So if anybody knows why this can't work, or where I can read up on constraints, then I'll do that, too.

[12:03] <sena_kun> ah, that's another deal.

[12:03] <sena_kun> well, another option is to use a subset.

[12:03] <sena_kun> but I myself don't know much about state of applying constraints in signature itself.

[12:03] <kensanata> AlexDaniel: I actually have this pull request that isn't being merged because of the test setup isn't working. https://github.com/Takadonet/Algorithm--Diff/pull/16

[12:29] <greppable6> lizmat, Sorry, can't do that

[12:30] <lizmat> will probably a lot faster

[12:30] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: so there's name and value, right? Why is rollback-123123 in the name and not in the value?

[12:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> kensanata: this way you'd need to just check if key exists, and then use value to see which button it is

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> I may be wrong

[12:31] *** harrison joined
[12:31] <kensanata> AlexDaniel: because for input of type submit, the value is the actual label shown on the button, i.e. "rollback" in all cases. Thus the information has to be encoded in the name instead, which is super awkward, I know.

[12:31] <AlexDaniel> also what lizmat++ said, depending on how often you expect the code to fire avoiding regexes can give you a noticeable speedup

[12:32] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v harrison

[14:03] <kensanata> More Cro questions... In my routes: post -> 'rollback', $id, $revision where /^\d+$/, :$author is cookie, :$secret is cookie { request-body -> (:$summary!, :$from, :$to) { ... } }. I don't actually use :$from, :$to in this route even though they are sent along by the form. If I remove them from the signature (is that what you call it?), this breaks in cro run but not for my tests.

[14:03] <kensanata> What's the explanation for this? Why can't I just drop :$from, :$to?

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: at least it has gons, unlike many submissions there

[14:05] *** rfold left
[14:06] <kensanata> Interesting. I had made some feeble attempts at guessing using %rest and :%rest, but I didn't know what I was doing.

[14:06] <kensanata> moritz: Where would I read up on this in the documentation?

[14:07] *** Guest46735 joined
[14:07] <moritz> kensanata: I think https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#index-entry-signature_literal should have all the documentation

[14:08] <moritz> kensanata: though signatures is such a big topic that I considered writing a small book about it :-)

[14:08] <kensanata> Haha.

[14:08] <moritz> basically, * means slurpy, so "give me all the rest"

[14:08] <kensanata> Actually, now that I've tried it, *% didn't work as intended.

[14:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Guest46735

[14:08] <moritz> and then @ stands for positional and % for named

[14:08] <moritz> and after that, optionally a name

[14:09] <moritz> hm, maybe Cro does some introspection of the signature? no idea...

[14:09] <jnthn> No, that is just a normal signature unpack of the body

[14:09] <jnthn> I've used *% plenty in that context

[14:09] <kensanata> Hm, going to try again.

[14:10] <jnthn> If it's JSON then it's just a Perl 6 hash there (well, provided the top level thing in the document is an object)

[14:10] <jnthn> If it's a www url encoded thingy or a multipart thing it's an object with a Capture method so it can support unpacking

[14:10] <jnthn> If you have some custom body parser / body object, then of course it has to implement Capture to say how it unpacks

[14:10] <kensanata> It worked. I think I mistakenly tried *$ instead of *%. Sorry!

[14:11] <jnthn> Ah :)

[14:11] *** Guest46735 left
[14:12] <jnthn> Cro does do a bunch of introspection and stuff on the signatures of the get/post/etc. handlers themselves, but `request-body` is just using the normal Perl 6 mechanism and not doing anything clever :)

[14:16] <El_Che> jnthn: if you're too often clever, people expect cleverness all the time :)

I remember talking about the libssl-dev dependency on https://rakudo.org/files/star/source but this sk_num thing confuses me. Ideas?

[14:42] <kensanata> Duckducking around, for unrelated stuff: "It looks like in version 1.1.0f of openssl the symbol OPENSSL_sk_num has moved to libcrypto.a." https://stackoverflow.com/a/45499265

[19:01] <azawawi> VSCode implements most things ofcourse with atom catching up and then neovim... etc

[19:01] <pmurias> azawawi: so being client agnostic isn't the goal?

[19:02] <azawawi> nope so far

[19:03] <azawawi> it is actually the hard part so far

[19:03] <azawawi> the plugin part

[19:04] <pmurias> isn't the plugin part supposed to be mostly starting up the Perl 6 language server?

[19:05] <squashable6> 🍕 AlexDaniel++ opened pull request “Minor code formatting changes”: https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/51

[19:10] <timotimo> what do you have against german quotation marks?

[19:10] <timotimo> oh, it's emacs that has the problem, i see.

[19:10] <azawawi> pmurias: yup 100% correct

[19:11] <azawawi> in startServerProcess

[19:11] <squashable6> 🍕 timo++ merged pull request “Minor code formatting changes”: https://github.com/timo/json_fast/pull/51

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yeah it sees the last “ and decides that the rest of the file is a string :( at least “” are supported

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> last time I checked german quotation marks were working, but I guess it depends

[19:13] <AlexDaniel> I don't know how it works, but I noticed that emacs attempts to be as lazy as possible when it comes to highlighting, or something like that

[19:14] <AlexDaniel> except that it is lazy and stupid, so sometimes I'm looking at mishighlighted code and I need to do some changes above the part that is mishighlighted to rehighlight it properly

[19:17] <timotimo> in vim i usually just have to scroll up a few pages, then back down

[19:21] <pmurias> azawawi: why isn't the language server that's being started intended to be client agnostic?

[19:23] *** cognominal-p6 left
[19:24] <AlexDaniel> heh, was looking for a big json file for benchmarking

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> 189.9 MB https://github.com/zemirco/sf-city-lots-json

[19:47] <azawawi> pmurias: the server is client-agonistic (HTTP-like headers + JSON::RPC payload) but you need metadata to open that document / langserver combination by the client (aka editor or ide)

[19:48] <azawawi> pmurias: so far it seems to be stdin/stdout but i saw also a socket implementation

[19:48] *** fake_space_whale left
[19:49] <pmurias> azawawi: so all the client/server pairings need to be done individually?

[19:49] *** cognominal-p6 left
[19:50] <pmurias> seems to be missing the point of the whole think but I haven't looked at it closely

[19:50] <azawawi> pmurias: also each client implements a subset of required features (syntax check, hover, rename var, ..etc) and your server can implement a subset

[19:51] <azawawi> pmurias: so basically Padre / farabi6 codebases are re-usable as a basis for a Perl 5 / 6 langservers

[19:51] <El_Che> azawawi: that would be awesome

[19:51] <azawawi> pmurias: but once a langserver is written, it is needs plugins for each editor / ide to activate it

[19:52] <azawawi> that'

[19:52] <azawawi> yup :)

[19:52] <azawawi> https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification

[19:52] <El_Che> this would make vim + perl6 awesome

[19:53] <azawawi> https://langserver.org/ # implementations

[19:53] <azawawi> scroll to "LSP clients" section

[19:54] <pmurias> azawawi: looking at some other language servers for the simpler ones the plugins are tiny

[19:55] <azawawi> some are re-using an SDK (library) :)

[19:55] <azawawi> we do not have an SDK

[19:55] *** goddess joined
[19:55] <azawawi> once done, we can do that :)

[19:56] <pmurias> azawawi: on the server side we don't have an SDK

[20:07] <Juerd> Yay, for the first time since months, my own benchmark canary is actually faster than before. It's been at 5.7 seconds for quite a while, and now it's consistent at 5.35 :)

[20:08] <El_Che> it's a counter that suppose to count till 2? :)

[20:09] <timotimo> phew

[20:10] <timotimo> Juerd: is that MQTT, by chance?

[20:19] <Juerd> timotimo: The regex.t from the mqtt module, but that doesn't do any actual mqtt connectivity, just regex building and matching

[20:21] <timotimo> right

[20:21] <timotimo> i remember something about expensive regex building, but that's probably from jdv's module

[20:22] <Juerd> It does expensive regex building

[20:29] <Kaiepi> why is this the case?

[20:29] <moritz> because you cannot assing to a sigilless "variable" later on

[20:29] <moritz> so it doesn't make sense to declare one without also assigning a value

[20:29] <moritz> the class doesn't matter here

[21:09] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: no, because I squinted really hard and tried making it a bit faster

[21:09] <AlexDaniel> adding more nqp ops seems to do it, but in the amount of less than 1%

[21:09] <timotimo> :D

[21:10] <timotimo> i still hope it can be drastically improved in the future.

[21:10] <AlexDaniel> not like this for sure: https://github.com/MasterDuke17/Text-Diff-Sift4/commit/524f98cdc95c3dc0d982c0ce0782406c61e4a772

[21:10] <timotimo> by cooperating with further optimizations in moarvm

[21:12] <AlexDaniel> in that code above changing every line was resulting in a measurable difference, and I can't get that with JSON::Fast no matter what I do

[21:12] <timotimo> yeah, it's a frustrating little module :) :)

[21:12] <AlexDaniel> and I have to wait for 20+ seconds between runs, annoying

[21:13] <squashable6> 🍕 AlexDaniel++ wrote a comment on “JSON::Fast is not fast enough!”: https://github.com/timo/json_fast/issues/45#issuecomment-427606743

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> on a positive note, my changes didn't seem to make the run time worse

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> even in hot paths

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> so I guess moarvm is doing a great job nowadays

[21:15] <AlexDaniel> I remember with Text::Diff::Sift4 you'd change something a little bit and boom, twice slower

[21:16] <AlexDaniel> anyway, I'll go find another victim :)
