[02:00] <atweiden-air> i updated the Digest::xxHash module today to bundle the xxHash native library

[02:00] <atweiden-air> however, i can only be sure it works on MacOS

[02:00] <atweiden-air> all tests pass on travis, but i can't get it to work on Arch Linux

[02:01] <atweiden-air> i suspect it has to do with how perl6 is installed on travis through rakudobrew

[02:03] <atweiden-air> if anyone wants to give Digest::xxHash a spin on their *nix, it's just a `zef install Digest::xxHash` away

[02:11] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: ===> Install [OK] for Digest::xxHash:ver<1.1.0>

[02:11] <Zoffix> looks like latest commit is passing on travis too

[02:12] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: my hunch is %?RESOURCES is the culprit; it's resolving to Nil post-installation, so Digest::xxHash module doesn't know where to find the xxHash shared object file on disk

[02:12] *** kurahaupo_ joined
[02:12] <Zoffix> Tho don't really follow the changes in this commit: you basically told it not to install any dependencies and try to build the module instead (and I think it builds it anyway at a later step) https://github.com/atweiden/digest-xxhash/commit/cecead8162cfd7efeb8dec6fafce2da7035a5714

[02:13] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -MDigest::xxHash -e 'say xxHash("dupa");'

[02:13] <Zoffix> -365782567106637186

[02:14] <atweiden-air> that commit is to instruct zef to run Build.pm, which then runs Digest::xxHash::BuildTools.{build,install}

[02:15] <atweiden-air> (there are no deps)

[02:15] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: right, but that's supposed to happen automatically no? 

[02:15] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: is using a constant for the path standard practice? It won't get updated on next recompilation of the module. https://github.com/atweiden/digest-xxhash/blob/cecead8162cfd7efeb8dec6fafce2da7035a5714/lib/Digest/xxHash.pm6#L5 

[02:15] <atweiden-air> dunno, travis-ci is a black box to me. i was just trying to nudge it into building libxxhash

[02:15] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: err, I mean, it'll get frozen after precompilation of the module and won't change 

[02:16] *** kurahaupo left
[02:17] <Zoffix> Somewhere there's a list of what the perl6 travis config runs, but I'm failing to find it

[02:17] <atweiden-air> not sure on `constant`. copied it from https://github.com/skinkade/p6-crypt-argon2

[02:18] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: travis is running rakudobrew, as is my mac. rakudobrew mysteriously has no issues with this

[02:19] *** pharv joined
[02:19] <Zoffix> No idea myself. Never used nativecall stuff

[02:19] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: seems the module works on Linux and I'm not using rakudobrew.

[02:19] <atweiden-air> do you install it with zef?

[02:20] <Zoffix> Yeah

[02:20] <atweiden-air> weird. how is your zef installed?

[02:21] <Zoffix> Here's full output of the install: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/299e5508fa899ca570853cfc4a5b7214

[02:21] <Zoffix> My zef is installed with manual installation steps: https://github.com/ugexe/zef#installation

[02:22] <Zoffix> And I'm using zef 0.2.3, on Rakudo version 2018.03-129-g7572983a4 on Bodhi Linux (fork of Ubuntu 14.04)

[02:23] <Zoffix> and rakudo's installed manually from sauce ( with https://github.com/zoffixznet/r#linux but building latest commit rather than release)

[02:27] *** Herby_ left
[02:30] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: i had never tried installing zef like that before

[02:30] <atweiden-air> but now that i've tried installing zef this way, it changes nothing :p

[02:31] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: which could mean my system-wide rakudo installation is somehow at fault (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rakudo)

[02:32] <atweiden-air> with my system-wide rakudo and zef manual installation, i noticed a warning "Use of Nil in string context" on line 5 in lib/Digest/xxHash.pm6, suggesting %?RESOURCES<libraries/xxhash> is Nil

[02:35] <atweiden-air> this raises a larger question i have, which is what is the best practice of deploying rakudo? building from source and installing without sudo?

[02:38] *** stee joined
[02:39] *** kurahaupo left
[02:39] *** kurahaupo joined
[02:42] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: I think packages are the best practice... 2018.03.1 is the latest compiler release, so that should be good.

[02:45] <AlexDaniel> wait, 2018.03.1?

[02:45] <AlexDaniel> oh, 2018.03-1

[02:46] <Zoffix> oh right, it was 2018.02 with the point release

[02:46] <atweiden-air> is there any way to specify %?RESOURCES for the repl's sake? maybe with an environment variable?

[02:47] * Zoffix has no idea

[16:48] * timotimo just checked in and will drive to the pre-conference meeting soon

[16:48] <Bowlslaw> anyone going to perl con in salt lake?

[16:48] <Bowlslaw> i'll be there :)

[16:49] <timotimo> oof, it's 45 minutes from here, eh?

[16:49] <Bowlslaw> you're in utah?

[16:49] <Bowlslaw> let me guess, park city?

[16:50] <Bowlslaw> naw...maybe...lindon or something

[16:50] <timotimo> uh, no, that's even farther from here

[16:51] <timotimo> sounds like a 16 hour flight

[16:52] <[Coke]> yes, I'll be there, just booked travel.

[16:52] *** pierre joined
[16:52] <Bowlslaw> i live here

[16:52] <Bowlslaw> me = lucky

[16:52] <[Coke]> https://github.com/perlconference/tpc-2018-slc/wiki/Perl-6-BOF

[16:52] <Bowlslaw> the thing is, why would they make it in Salt Lake? There are only 3 companies of which I know that use Perl, one of which I work at

[16:53] <El_Che> Bowlslaw: probably good venue

[16:53] <Bowlslaw> El_Che: Excellent venue, it's the Little America

[16:53] <Bowlslaw> and it's just a great city overall

[16:53] <[Coke]> One big requirement for hosting the TPC is having an active set of volunteers to run the con.

[16:53] <Bowlslaw> except for the pollution

[16:54] <El_Che> I have never been to a conference in the USA, but from what colleagues tell me and what I have seen, I think I would hate it

[16:54] <[Coke]> so every year, different groups put up proposals for hosting.

[16:54] <El_Che> congress halls and the like instead of in the city

[16:54] * [Coke] wonders what a "congress hall" is

[16:54] <timotimo> i hope i won't miss most of the meetup :o

[16:54] * timotimo drives off

[16:54] <Bowlslaw> why would you hate it? i've never been to one

[16:55] <El_Che> conference venue too far from civilization

[16:55] <Bowlslaw> eh??

[16:55] <El_Che> I am not saying the one at salt like is like one

[16:55] <Bowlslaw> Little America is the middle of downtown Salt Lake

[16:55] <[Coke]> not sure if you've seen the map, but this looks like it's in the middle of a huge city.

[16:55] <El_Che> good venue then

[16:55] <Bowlslaw> i live there

[16:55] * [Coke] hurls https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/location/

[16:56] <El_Che> collegued asked me if I wanted to go to a microsoft conference in the middle of nowhere in florida

[16:56] <El_Che> answer was no and no :)

[16:57] <Bowlslaw> well, what kind of food do you like?

[16:57] *** pierre left
[16:57] <Bowlslaw> becuase I can show you some delicious and authentic: Korean, Indian, Chinese, Italian, Greek, and other random great places

[17:00] <El_Che> not the stay-in-the-conference-hall/hotel-and-join-us-to-the-organized-trip-to-disneyland :)

[17:00] <El_Che> Bowlslaw: it seems to be a nice city

[17:00] <Bowlslaw> haha hell no

[17:00] <El_Che> got to go

[17:00] <Bowlslaw> It is a nice city, but when there is no wind or it becomes winter

[17:00] <El_Che> train arrives

[17:00] <Bowlslaw> the air becomes polluted

[17:00] <Bowlslaw> due to an "inversion" effect which traps the air in the valley
