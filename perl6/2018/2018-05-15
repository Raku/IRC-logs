[06:16] <Guest60583> `run 'echo', "\$0"`

[06:17] <Guest60583> how do you get $0?

[06:18] <jmerelo> Guest60583: as in the executable name? Or the first argument of an external program?

[06:18] <tyil> Guest60583: you mean just capture the output of the `run`?

[06:18] <Guest60583> `shell 'echo $0'` = /bin/sh

[06:19] <jmerelo> p6: run "echo", "\$0"

[06:20] <Guest60583> shell = qx = qqx

[06:21] <jmerelo> perl6 -e 'shell "echo \$0"' returns "/bin/sh" in my case

[06:21] <Guest60583> what does run use if not /bin/sh?

[06:26] <Guest60583> is `run` faster than `echo` & `qx` & `qqx` because it does it without the shell overhead?

[06:26] <Guest60583> s/echo/shell

[06:27] <moritz> Guest60583: have you tried to benchmark it?

[06:27] <jmerelo> Guest60583: that might be the case. Did you benchmark it?

[06:27] <jmerelo> (and I saw moritz's answer while I was writing...)

[06:27] <Guest60583> how do you benchmark it?

[06:27] <Guest60583> cpu scheduling and stuff can interfere

[06:28] <Guest60583> run only runs a single command

[13:49] <Zoffix> donpdonp: maybe .perl is lying? Did you figure out the problem?

[13:50] <SourceBaby> Zoffix, Sauce is at https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/9aa6747f8/src/core/Buf.pm6#L856

[13:50] <timotimo> yup

[13:52] <donpdonp> Zoffix: i took the easy way out and rebuilt the Buf from the Buf :)

[13:52] <timotimo> i sure hope it isn't one of the cases where there's two types of the same name that should be equal but have different addressess

[13:52] <Zoffix> donpdonp: what's the code that was causing the problem?

[13:52] <donpdonp> well now i need to learn what .WHAT does  :)

[13:52] <Zoffix> If it's a bug, it should be fixed.

[13:52] <Zoffix> donpdonp: it returns the type object of the thing

[13:52] <Zoffix> it's a fake method

[13:52] <timotimo> since buf is one of the things that are punned roles

[13:54] <donpdonp> Zoffix: well hard to narrow down the bug. $my_class.param.buf_var eqv $identical_buf is False

[13:54] <donpdonp> also its late here and my brain is tired.

[13:54] <Zoffix> donpdonp: what's .param? Just some method?

[13:55] <donpdonp> https://github.com/donpdonp/blkmev/blob/master/lib/BlkMeV/Chain/Chain.pm6#L23

[13:55] <Zoffix> donpdonp: also, is this in a module? As in, is the $my_class from one module, but.... .. Ok, I'll play with the repo

[13:55] <donpdonp> $chain.params is set to BlkMeV::Chain::Params::BitcoinCash.new, which has a Buf (.header)

[13:58] <Zoffix> FWIW you can write this https://github.com/donpdonp/blkmev/blob/e73142e298d118dad9b9e4c99a28659c60e052cc/bin/blkmev#L21-L22   as just `$client_supplier.emit: $chain, :$host.Pair, True;`¬†That way `:$host` won't get passed as named arg

[14:11] <idiosyncrat> Hi.  I've been doing a "Timeline" of parsing history, in which TimToady plays a signficant role.  He's been generous in answering Q's in the past, and I hope he'll indulge another.

[14:12] <idiosyncrat> When *I* used yacc, I didn't know how to calculate LALR, so I did it by trial-and-error and a sense of what had worked in the past.

[14:13] <idiosyncrat> Once I did know enough math to calculate LALR states, I also knew better than to try to use yacc/bison :-)

[14:13] *** Zoffix left
[14:14] <idiosyncrat> TimToady: you created what AFAIK is the largest most-sophisticated yacc/bison grammar to achieve wide use.  Did you ever explicitly calculate LALR states?

[14:19] <yoleaux> I saw TimToady 11 May 2018 00:39Z in #perl6: <TimToady> or maybe it's looking for the corresponding action routine

[19:49] <El_Che> nope

[19:49] <timotimo> they have analyzed your mouse movements and such and have found out that you are likely to shell out cash for a plan if they just make it difficult enough to find the free plan

[19:50] <Zoffix> OK, I get the "Free" option is I use my US proxy.

[19:50] <Zoffix> But not if I connect from Canukistan

[19:54] <Zoffix> k, I see. If, when it asks you, you say you wanna sell products on the site, it doesn't offer you free option and it saves that setting in a cookie so even if you unselect "store" option it still doesn't show you free version

[20:16] *** Ven`` joined
[20:16] <masak> but what Perl 6 calls @array[*-1], C# spells string[^1]

[20:17] <masak> also, they're introducing Python's slice operator in indices `:`, except they're spelling it `..`

[20:33] <lucasb> m: enum bool <true false>; multi f(true) { 'true' }; multi f(false) { 'false' }; say list f(true), f(false)

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´(true false)‚ê§¬ª

[20:33] <lucasb> ^^ I wanted to do this with real booleans, but apparently I can't

[20:34] <lucasb> m: multi f(True) {}

[20:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´Potential difficulties:‚ê§    Literal values in signatures are smartmatched against and smartmatch with `True` will always succeed. Use the `where` clause instead.‚ê§    at <tmp>:1‚ê§    ------> 3multi f(True7‚èè5) {}‚ê§¬ª

[20:35] <masak> there's an old curse installed about smartmatching literal Bool types

[20:35] <masak> m: my $b = True; say "well hello there" ~~ $b

[20:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[20:36] <masak> it's because of that ^

[20:36] <masak> the $b on the rhs (True) always matches, no matter what's on the lhs

[20:36] <masak> m: my $b = True; say False ~~ $b

[20:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[20:37] <masak> m: multi f(Bool $b where $b == True) { say "this works" }; f(True); f(False)

[20:37] <masak> but yeah, it's the WAT corresponding to a DWIM

[20:38] *** Ven`` left
[20:39] <masak> oh, and the real use case for the DWIM behavior is something like this:

[20:40] <masak> m: sub is-odd($n) { $n % 2 != 0 }; say 33 ~~ is-odd($_)

[20:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[20:40] <masak> m: sub is-odd($n) { $n % 2 != 0 }; say 20 ~~ is-odd($_)

[20:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[20:41] <lucasb> that made it clearer. thanks masak

[20:42] <masak> m: sub is-odd($n) { $n % 2 != 0 }; say 33 ~~ &is-odd; say 20 ~~ &is-odd

[20:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§False‚ê§¬ª

[20:42] <masak> apparently, that works, too :)

[20:43] <masak> also also, the case for actually smartmatching with booleans is a lot stronger in a `when` clause than with the actual infix:<~~> operator, I'd wager

[22:33] <timotimo> say, perl6.org and all related sites also write logs from the webserver, and i believe we do analyze them?

[23:24] <tyil> yes, I am aware

[23:25] <tyil> it has been discussed already

[23:25] <tyil> source-url is not specced yet so I dont use it yet

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> weekly: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/8jj5tv/mixing_function_overloading_and_named_parameters/dz0mmxn/

[23:25] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted!

[23:25] <tyil> I've had very bad experience with using things that are documented somewhere and used somewhere but not actually specced yet

[23:26] <tyil> as in, they break installation of the module completely with very LTA errors

[23:26] <tyil> so I just dont use them at all now

[23:26] <tyil> I aint taking the risk

[23:26] <AlexDaniel> tyil: yes but‚Ä¶ it's really inconvenient when you can't file a bug report because there's no link at all

[23:27] <tyil> better get it specced asap then

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> or a PR

[23:27] * tyil shrugs

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> tyil: is there a bug report for that?

[23:27] <tyil> idk really, I was told it would be discussed at the Perl Toolchain Summit

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> what's that?

[23:28] <tyil> some event where they discuss Perl toolchain aspects

[23:28] <tyil> I wasnt there myself

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> mmm‚Ä¶

[23:29] *** wamba joined
[23:30] <tyil> I was also informed that App::Assixt broke on a recent commit of perl 6

[23:30] <tyil> which saddens me

[23:31] <Zoffix> tyil: source-url isn't part of spec. It's the ecosystem extension. You can add support->source which is part of proposed spec

[23:31] <Zoffix> tyil: the PTS already occured BTW.

[23:31] <tyil> yes, as I told before, I'm eagerly awaiting it to be accepted and implemented instead of proposed

[23:31] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: but clones the objects before mixing in, while does doesn't

[23:32] <tyil> and I know it occured, I havent heard anything new yet

[23:32] <tyil> so I just went on to write more articles on Perl 6 and patching my modules where necessary

[23:32] <tyil> and work on a new feature of assixt

[23:32] *** Zoffix left
[23:32] <tyil> with feedback from the local perl mongers

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> tyil: it shouldn't sadden you I think. A 4 day old commit broke something, but didn't cause any failures in the spec. I test the ecosystem before the release, which is why we see that some modules are kaput

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> so it's marked as blocker for the release, and I make sure it's fixed before 2018.05

[23:34] <tyil> neat

[23:34] <tyil> even though samcv does releases I dont know much of the process itself

[23:35] <AlexDaniel> I do the same thing every month btw, but in the past I used not to publish any results from toaster

[23:35] <AlexDaniel> but basically I go through every failure and file blocker tickets

[23:35] <tyil> if an actual release breaks something or someone comes to me and reports a bug I'll look at it, but I tend to only support Star releases since they're easier to target

[23:35] <AlexDaniel> or submit PRs to modules if it's actually the module itself that is in the wrong

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> e.g. this month we have a bunch of modules that are sometimes red because of:

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> m: my %h = <a 1 b 2 c 3>; say %h.keys

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5ce24929f: OUTPUT: ¬´(c b a)‚ê§¬ª

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> m: my %h = <a 1 b 2 c 3>; say %h.keys
