[02:10] <Todd_> I want to remove `/.xx` (could be xxx) from the string

[02:13] <AlexDaniel> Todd_: like this?

[02:13] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x=‘"123","abc /.55",""’; say $x; $x~~s|‘/.’<[0..9]>+||; say $x

[02:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8cd70d1ee: OUTPUT: «"123","abc /.55",""␤"123","abc ",""␤»

[02:13] <AlexDaniel> or this

[02:13] <Todd_> testing

[02:14] <AlexDaniel> you can use normal '' quotes instead of curly unicode ones ‘’

[02:15] <Todd_> `` can be used only once in `perl5 -e ''`

[02:16] <Todd_> Is there a way to tell the to find the `/` and staop right before the next quote?

[08:06] <jast> the difference is that Perl 6 treats your escape sequences as Unicode characters, whereas Perl 5 just outputs the raw bytes by default

[12:45] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: great, thanks. Let's see if the intermitent bug is solved... Before, it was one out of every 3-4 builds.

[12:45] <AlexDaniel> I don't think anything changed regarding that issue

[12:46] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: my hunch is that it was some memory issue in the test where it failed. I divided the tests in two different batches.

[12:46] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: so, who knows...

[12:46] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: it's not solving the underlying issue, but the underlying issue is hard to catch... 

[12:48] <jmerelo> Next Friday, Perl 6 meetup in Granada https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Granada-Geek/events/250371416/?_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDJmNGRkN2FlLWYxODUtNGNkNi04YjhiLWMyMmZlMDhlY2M2NA&_af=event&_af_eid=250371416 Perl 6 and free beer (it's on me). Anyone's in? :-)

[12:52] *** mcmillhj joined
[12:52] <AlexDaniel> we can start earlier if it's not

[12:52] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: yep, pretty much. Don't worry about that. First hour or so will be a talk on Pod 6, and some guidelines on how to spot bugs.

[12:54] <jmerelo> Most people will have very little or no experience with Perl 6. It will be more an introduction to Perl 6, and maybe some help translating README.md or some intro to the community

[12:54] *** natrys joined
[12:54] <jmerelo> My intention is not so much having them squashing bugs, but try to create a core of a small community here that can help in the future.

[13:49] <evalable6> comborico1611, rakudo-moar 8cd70d1ee: OUTPUT: «word count: 8␤»

[13:50] <comborico1611> What are the 8?

[13:51] <moritz> the number of matches

[13:51] <moritz> but if you want the word count, ues \w+, not \w*

[13:51] <comborico1611> There are many more \w than 8 there.

[13:51] <moritz> because empty words aren't very interesting

[13:52] *** Zoffix joined
[13:52] <Zoffix> moritz: how come empties get in there?

[13:52] <moritz> but you didn't ask for m:g/\w/ either

[13:52] <moritz> Zoffix: \w* matches the empty string

[13:52] <moritz> and :g skips to the next starting position before trying again

[13:52] *** molaf joined
[13:53] <Zoffix> If it's an empty string, wouldn't the next starting position be the same?

[13:53] <moritz> no, only with :exhaustive

[13:53] <moritz> :g *always* advances the position by at least one

[13:55] <Zoffix> Then, I don't get it: "foo bar" => [0] = "[foo] bar"; it advances by one to after space => [1] = "[bar]". Where does the empty come from? Is it from before or after the space?

[13:55] <Zoffix> Ah

[13:55] <Zoffix> OK, before space

[13:55] <Zoffix> OK, I get now. Thanks.

[13:55] <moritz> yw :)

[13:56] <moritz> and yes, that was kinda confusing to figure out before we could implement it

[13:56] <Zoffix> :)

[13:56] <moritz> (at least, confusing to me; not sure if TimToady++ or pmichaud_++ were confused by such trivia :D)

[13:57] <moritz> the starting position is basically max( $previous.to, $previous.from + 1)

[13:59] <comborico1611> Well, I'm going to ignore it and move on.  I'm feeling low energy this morning.

[14:00] <moritz> that... doesn't motivate me at all to answer future questions

[14:00] <comborico1611> You should realize not everyone is in perfect health.

[14:01] <moritz> I'm not expecting perfect health, but I do expect some other feedback than "I'm ignoring your answer" when I answer a question

[14:01] <moritz> could be as simple as "can't understand it right now, will save it and look at it later"

[14:01] <comborico1611> I never said I was ignoring your answer.  By "it" I mean, I'm ignoring the issue.  Too much too tackle and not worth the time.  I need to move on to more fundamental topics.

[14:03] <moritz> well, I'll know what to expect in future.

[14:04] <comborico1611> Likewise.

[14:05] <Zoffix> comborico1611: `\w` is what you match. The `*`, `+`, `?` and a bunch of others are quantifiers that tell the computer how many things to match. So `\w*` says to look for `\w` things and match them 0 or more times. If you want each of \w things, then don't specify the quantifier (default is match 1 thing). If you want words only (so exclude the zero-sized matches), then change `\w*` to `\w+` to mean "match one

[14:05] <Zoffix> or more of \w things". There's also `.words` method that would do the same but a lot clearer

[16:34] <jkramer> I think it there should be a way to use the return value of .keys or .grep(:k) as address somehow

[16:37] <jkramer> Well because .grep currently returns a single Int that seems to be the office of the match in @foo.flat :)

[16:40] <jkramer> I guess .grep internally just runs itself on .flat of the invocant

[16:41] <jkramer> At least for multi-dimensional arrays

[22:35] <Herby_> tyil: it's gathering dust at the moment.  I wasn't sure if it would be useful

[22:35] <yoleaux> 13:18Z <tyil> Herby_: How's the SO bot coming along (iirc you were working on that, right?)

[22:35] <Herby_> .tell tyil:  it's gathering dust at the moment.  I wasn't sure if it would be useful

[22:35] <yoleaux> Herby_: What kind of a name is "tyil:"?!

[22:35] <Herby_> .tell tyil it's gathering dust at the moment.  I wasn't sure if it would be useful

[22:35] <yoleaux> Herby_: I'll pass your message to tyil.

[23:20] <Herby_> tyil: you got any more tutorials in the works?  That "Introduction to application programming" was great

[23:21] <tyil> Herby_: I've been thinking to make one to highlight the neat tricks provided by the MAIN sub more

[23:21] <tyil> it's why I've asked https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50135530/how-to-require-1-or-more-of-an-argument-in-main

[23:22] <tyil> I have made a small application to play around with it more, how POD will be rendered in the USAGE, and how you can apply the correct constraints on them

[23:22] <Herby_> awesome!

[23:22] *** dylanwh joined
[23:23] <tyil> in this case I want to constrain to getting one or more arguments

[23:23] *** marcusramberg joined
[23:23] <tyil> there's some nice tricks in the answers, but none seem like a cleaner solution than what I have already without breaking default USAGE

[23:24] <tyil> cant have it all :p

[23:26] <tyil> I might add in some binary testing, so running the actual program and looking at it's STDOUT stream to see if you're getting the intended effects

[23:27] <tyil> (not sure how to do that myself properly, which makes it all the more interesting)
