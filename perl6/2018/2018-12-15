[09:27] <jmerelo> lizmat: roast? Rakudo? There are 600 issues in Rakudo. Let's tame that monster before it turns 666

[09:28] <lizmat> :-)

[09:28] <jmerelo> (it's 662 already, so it's probably too late anyway)

[09:29] <jmerelo> lizmat: roast has 11 PRs there. Some of them from 2014... 

[09:30] <jmerelo> roast is probably more approachable than Rakudo. At least for me...

[09:32] <lizmat> jmerelo: I would like to get read-int/write-int into proper shape before the release, promise to look at PR's after having done that

[09:33] <jmerelo> lizmat: great. But do you think it would be a good topic for the Squashathon?

[09:34] <jmerelo> lizmat: last "testneeded" hackathon was in April

[09:34] <lizmat> sounds like a plan to me  :-)

[21:23] <TreyHarris> *way

[21:38] <TreyHarris> I rewound to the most recent commit before mine, that passed and was written to the website, by JJ Merelo (is he on here? I don't know his nick) -- it fails the same way

[21:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kensanata

[21:46] <TreyHarris> So, there were updates to some of the modules tests depend on since 3 days ago (when the commit before mine was done), so I'm assuming the issue was introduced by one of them

[21:49] *** rindolf left
[21:53] <TreyHarris> I can't figure out an easy way to rewind the modules though, so... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

[21:58] <tobs`> I have a module that ships with a program in its %?RESOURCES which it has to execute at runtime. It works with `perl6 -Ilib` but I get "permission denied" when the module is installed.

[21:59] <tobs`> I assume the installer removes the +x bit? Can I get it back somehow?

[22:00] <TreyHarris> tobs`: you get that for free if you put it into bin/ rather than lib/ -- create a wrapper there?

[22:02] <TreyHarris> tobs`: it can be as simple as https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/bin/zef

[22:02] <tobs`> TreyHarris: the program is built from C sources, it's not a perl6 bin.

[22:04] <tobs`> or would your suggestion still apply in that case?

[22:07] <TreyHarris> tobs`: not sure, but it's worth a try

[22:07] <TreyHarris> I'd think so, grepping through some build code

[22:15] *** molaf joined
[22:15] <tobs`> TreyHarris: I'm trying it now, but there is a problem: how do I find the program if not through %?RESOURCES anymore? I assume that it'd be in PATH as soon as the module is installed, but the installation needs the tests to pass, which in turn require access to that program.

[22:15] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v molaf

[22:16] <tobs`> It's really more of a resource for my module than a product of it.

[22:16] <TreyHarris> tobs`: append './bin' to PATH as you do '.' to PERL6LIB?

[22:16] <TreyHarris> Oh, you mean it won't be in the shipped package?

[22:17] <TreyHarris> It's author-only?

[22:17] <tobs`> TreyHarris: no, it's a C program (in no distro's repositories) which my Perl 6 module provides an interface to.

[22:18] <TreyHarris> "in no distro's repositories"... meaning no Linux distro? No module repo? No GitHub repo?

[22:20] <tobs`> no Linux distro. There are repositories of it on the web, one of which is a submodule in my module's repo. A concrete example: https://github.com/taboege/p6-SAT-Solver-MiniSAT

[22:21] <tobs`> with "no repositories" I was trying to say that I can't delegate correct installation of that C program to some other dependency mechanism outside zef.

[22:56] <SmokeMachine> I can override the `~` operator, so I can make `"bla " ~ $my-obj` make anything I want... but how can I do that with `"bla { $my-obj }"`?

[23:00] <tobs> SmokeMachine: that calls $my-obj.Str

[23:01] <SmokeMachine> tobs: yes, but it will always return a Str, right? I mean:

[23:01] <tobs> m: class A { method Str { "something completely different" } }; say "bla { A.new } "

[23:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 203487f3e: OUTPUT: ¬´bla something completely different ‚ê§¬ª

[23:02] <tobs> yeah, about bending its meaning more, I have no idea.

[23:03] <SmokeMachine> ?

[23:06] <SmokeMachine> m: class C {}; multi infix:<~>(Str, C) {42}; say "test" ~ C.new

[23:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 203487f3e: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[23:17] <TreyHarris> ^that confuses me

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> I don't think `is default` is doing anything there

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> at least not for what you're showing

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> I guess there's another candidate that is narrower?

[23:22] *** lucasb left
[23:27] *** zakharyas left
[23:29] <TreyHarris> The other candidates are (Str, Str), (Str, Junction), (Junction, Str), and (Junction, Junction)

[23:30] <TreyHarris> So I thought (_, C) would be narrower for parameters (Str, C) than (Str, Str)

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: ok let's check something‚Ä¶

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> 6c: class C {}; multi infix:<~>($a, C) is default {42}; say "test" ~ C.new

[23:31] <TreyHarris> Either the first argument can be passed as whatever and C matches exactly, or C must be coerced to Str so you have two Strs... 

[23:31] <AlexDaniel> wait for it

[23:31] <committable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/b3d7c62a7ef369a765cd4cfa2b7d15ef

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> so until 2018.08 it used to do what you want

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> let's bisect then‚Ä¶

[23:32] <AlexDaniel> bisect: class C {}; multi infix:<~>($a, C) is default {42}; say "test" ~ C.new

[23:32] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, Bisecting by output (old=2015.12 new=203487f) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[23:32] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, bisect log: https://gist.github.com/efff3094c4c18896eaf8fc6797107997

[23:32] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, (2018-08-09) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/3ae97e5f38e85a5db76053ed2c7757c59a22f73d

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> and let's double check just to be sure

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> c: 3ae97e5f38^,3ae97e5f38 class C {}; multi infix:<~>($a, C) is default {42}; say "test" ~ C.new

[23:33] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¬¶3ae97e5f38^: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª ¬¶3ae97e5: ¬´testC<94427766515840>‚ê§¬ª

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[23:33] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: can you file a ticket?

[23:33] <jnthn> `is default` is just a tie-breaker, fwiw

[23:34] <jnthn> It only comes into play if there'd otherwise be an ambiguous dispatch

[23:34] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: been trying to figure out how the docs broke... after that, sure

[23:35] <TreyHarris> Or maybe I'll just file an issue for that, too

[23:35] <AlexDaniel> I'll file it now if you don't mind

[23:36] <TreyHarris> Not at all. Cc me?

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: R#2548

[23:52] <SmokeMachine> is there a way to override `"bla {ble}"` to return something that's not a Str?

[23:54] <timotimo> m: sub circumfix:<` `>($a) { say "i'm returning $a now"; }; `"hello {1 + 1}"`

[23:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 203487f3e: OUTPUT: ¬´i'm returning hello 2 now‚ê§¬ª

[23:54] <SmokeMachine> hum!

[23:55] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: sorry, I mean ""...

[23:55] <SmokeMachine> q(), qq(), etc...

[23:56] <timotimo> not without a Slang, i believe
