[03:40] <lucs> I'm wondering why for example neither IO::String nor Text::CSV appear there (but they are both on github).

[03:41] <lucs> Oh, wait.

[03:44] <lucs> Hmm... A search on the site finds both (but Text::CSV doesn't show up when clicking the "TEXT" tag, and IO::String, the "IO" tag).

[03:44] <lucs> Now, for my real question.

[03:45] <lucs> How can I get those two modules to work together, given that Text::CSV implements its own version of IO::String?

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> raschipi: but locking anything related to that issue is not going to help really

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> in some sense we actually had a lot of progress recently in understanding what we actually want from a new name

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> or an alias, or whatever you want to call it

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> problem is that this understanding is not evenly distributed across the community :)

[14:52] *** pierre_ left
[14:53] <AlexDaniel> so speaking out your mind regarding this issue is actually helpful in this case, IMO, even if it looks like there's a lot of tension in the discussion

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> and IMO this comment by Zoffix is very helpful to get us all thinking into the same direction

[14:59] <Zoffix> ufobat_: not really, .? is more about checking whether method exists, not whether the given args can be accepted. The shortest I can think is `my $b = "meow".encode; $b.can("decode").grep(*.cando: \($b)).head andthen .($b).say`

[14:59] <yoleaux> 1 Mar 2018 21:57Z <DrForr> Zoffix: pushed.

[14:59] <yoleaux> 1 Mar 2018 21:58Z <DrForr> Zoffix: (for perl6-ANTLR, that is)

[14:59] <yoleaux> 1 Mar 2018 22:09Z <DrForr> Zoffix: passed on Travis, thanks again.

[14:59] <Zoffix> I can see how that could be useful in core. Would be great to try it out as a slang module first.

[15:00] <raschipi> I agree that the discussion should go on, just on the appropriate forums, not in an urelated bug report. 

[15:00] <Zoffix> m: my $b = "meow".encode; $b.can("decode").grep(*.cando: \($b)).head andthen .($b).say

[15:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 611764757: OUTPUT: ¬´meow‚ê§¬ª

[15:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 611764757: ( no output )

[15:01] <raschipi> Even because that will be archived shortly and remove good arguments to somewhere they can't be found easily.

[16:32] <vcv> For a return constraint in a signature, can you specify the return value must be a list of 2 items where the first item is a Str and second is an Int?

[16:34] <jnthn> Don't think you can put a where clause directly there, but there's always something like:

[16:35] <jnthn> m: my subset ListStrInt of List where (Str, Int); sub foo(--> ListStrInt) { return ("foo", 42) }; say foo

[16:51] <ctilmes> moritz: re: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49036300/nativecall-loading-a-library-symbol-i-dont-call, I don't think I'm expressing my need properly

[16:52] <ctilmes> moritz: I call one third party library (I don't control), that then calls a second third party library (I don't control).  In C, I just "-l<lib1> -l<lib2>" and it works fine

[16:52] <ctilmes> moritz: but in perl, I can only specify "is native('lib1')"

[16:53] <ctilmes> moritz: I need a way to say "look for symbols in lib2 also"

[16:53] <moritz> ctilmes: so isn't it a bug in lib1 that -l<lib1> itself doesn't work?

[16:53] <moritz> or is this usual in C land?

[16:54] <ctilmes> In C land, it is normal to list all the libraries that are needed to the linker

[16:54] *** pharv joined
[16:54] <moritz> I know that, but that doesn't answer my question :-)

[16:54] *** robertle_ left
[16:55] <ctilmes> Is it a bug in lib1 that you must link in lib2 when you build your executable?  I don't think so.

[16:55] <moritz> depending on how common that case is, I see two possible solutions

[16:56] <ctilmes> Some libraries have 'plugin' type dynamic library loading, and will pull in the right one, but many don't.  I don't think that is a bug.

[16:56] *** pharv left
[16:56] *** pharv joined
[16:56] <moritz> one is to build a very thing thing in C that you link with both libraries, so that you don't expose that complication to NativeCall

[16:57] <moritz> and the other is to teach NativeCall to load more than one lib for a symbol

[16:57] <ctilmes> yes!  #2 is what I think we need.

[17:00] <ctilmes> I don't really understand MoarVM or NativeCall internals, but I suspect the is native() trait says something like "load library x, then call symbol y".  I just need a way to say "load library x", but don't call anything yet.

[17:21] <ctilmes> jnthn: is there a `nqp::loadlibrary('xxx')' or some such?

[17:24] <thowe> As a pedagogical example for showing some basic concept about ints and floats, they generate a SVG surface plot.  So I get caught up in the details of relearning highschool geometry and SVG XML markup.

[17:26] <thowe> They try to say the details aren't that important, but then the exercises kind of require you to get in to those details to do anything.  I don't know if I'm stupid or the authors just love the smell of their own farts too much.

[17:26] <El_Che> thowe: which one is it?

[17:27] <thowe> "The Go Programming Language"

[17:27] <thowe> I feel I'm getting exposed to a lot of things and learning nothing interesting about the language.

[17:28] <El_Che> I recall vaguely that "Go in Action" was better

[17:28] <El_Che> but I did the go reading on safari

[17:28] <El_Che> so no memory of physical artefacts

[17:31] <thowe> I'm an occasional programmer/hobbiest...  I need to at least do a couple of them.  I just play with this stuff for fun.

[17:31] <El_Che> thowe: I always invent a small project

[17:31] <thowe> It has been proven nobody will pay me to just write code.

[17:32] <El_Che> for learning go I wrote a small check script that read the netscaler load blaancer api and waned when a percentage of backends were down

[17:32] <thowe> I usually have one in mind before buying the book.  There's always small scripting needs at work.

[17:33] <El_Che> and a deployment tool (git, encryption, docker deployment) used until our Linux admins deployed an orchestration tool (they did, so obsoleting the tool)

[17:34] <thowe> I was going to write a script that generated some config data for snmp requests.  I ended up just writing it in Perl.

[17:34] <El_Che> for perl6 I wrote a small program for our CA migration (we have about 3000 domains). It connected to the host, verified if the cert was renewed with the new CA, if not send warnings to the owners in -30, -15, -7, -1 and +1 days

[17:34] <El_Che> it's still in production until somewhere in april this year

[17:34] <thowe> IThe Influxdb version in Go isn't very flexible

[17:35] <El_Che> then all the cert should be EOL'ed :)

[17:36] <El_Che> yeah, been there. For a project with advanced LDAP funcionalaties I tried in order Perl 6, Go and Perl 5

[17:36] <jnthn> ctilmes: Pretty sure not

[17:36] <thowe> I want to rewrite our invoice calculator and LD rating engine for work in Perl6

[17:36] <El_Che> on perl5 had a mature lib

[17:36] <jnthn> ctilmes: Think it passes down the library and symbol together

[17:38] <thowe> It is pretty low tech today...  Practically just some really basic Ruby wrapping SQL.  A decent DateTime lib and persistent DB connections will revolutionize it.  Also, Perl6's Integer math will make it more readable since I won't need to use a bigfloat lib.

[17:38] <ctilmes> or some sort of undefined or empty string or whatever

[17:38] <El_Che> thowe: in general it's more fun to write code in Perl6, Perl 5 has the libs (on the devops ecosystem Go has more libs) and Go is way easier to deploy

[17:38] <jnthn> Could be one way to do it, though whatever we do, we'll want some decent Perl 6 level interface

[17:41] <raschipi> Go is easier to deploy but much harder to give security support.

[17:41] <El_Che> raschipi: it's ok if part of a CI system

[17:42] <El_Che> (aka go programs are part of my docker image)

[17:42] <El_Che> (same goes for perl programs)

[17:43] <raschipi> It's not in my experience, keeping track of where everything is on programming.

[17:43] <El_Che> raschipi: what go is lacking, and this affect security, is decent lib versioning

[17:44] <raschipi> Oh, but introducing it means it will not be as easy to deploy...

[17:44] <El_Che> not really

[17:44] <El_Che> it's a compile time thing, not runtime

[17:44] <raschipi> They will introduce it because they want to support reproducible builds.

[17:44] <El_Che> the work is for the programmer

[17:44] <El_Che> raschipi: exactly

[17:45] <raschipi> To give it proper security support it's necessary to rebuild everything with security patches, so not a job for the ISV.

[17:46] <raschipi> Not easy, besides deployment environment, supporting go requires a build environment.

[17:52] <raschipi> I would agree go usual procedures would be acceptable (without gcc-go) if it was a pure go shop. But I have to support C, C++, Perl, Pascal, Javascript (both node and in the clients), etc. Go requires a very different procedure, requiring full rebuilds when depedencies release patches instead of just deploying patched binaries like the others.

[17:53] <raschipi> So I try to use go with gcc-go and shared libraries, which makes it similar to the others, but not always possible.

[17:56] <raschipi> And proper support for versions won't mean much if the community doesn't pick up supporting stable versions, which they won't. They will keep requiring and supporting only HEAD, breaking ABI every other version, requiring rewriting applications constantly.

[19:38] <ionest> Hi guys. Is there a way to get a string (not a match object) when you match against a regex? 

[19:39] <ionest> e.g., my $title = $html ~~ /'<title>' (.*?) '</title>'/

[19:39] <ionest> rakudo: my $title = "<title>Title</title>" ~~ /'<title>' (.*?) '</title>'/

[19:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 440fceacc: ( no output )

[19:39] <ionest> rakudo: my $title = "<title>Title</title>" ~~ /'<title>' (.*?) '</title>'/; say $title.^name;

[19:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 440fceacc: OUTPUT: ¬´Match‚ê§¬ª

[19:40] <ionest> Using a prefix ~ in a separate line is too wordy

[19:41] <AlexDaniel> m: my $title = ~"<title>Title</title>".match: /'<title>' (.*?) '</title>'/; say $title.^name

[19:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 440fceacc: OUTPUT: ¬´Str‚ê§¬ª
