[02:28] <perlawhirl> hrm... just noticed 'set' gist is lowercase, but 'Bag' and 'Mix' are not

[02:28] <perlawhirl> m: say (.Set, .Bag, .Mix given <A B>) 

[02:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(set(A B) Bag(A, B) Mix(A, B))␤»

[02:29] <perlawhirl> anyone else pedantic enough for this to bother them? :D

[02:29] <MasterDuke> also no comma

[02:29] <perlawhirl> ahh, I'd missed that

[02:29] <perlawhirl> MasterDuke++

[02:29] <perlawhirl> so there's that too

[02:30] <perlawhirl> I don't really mind which way it's normalised, but consistancy would be nice

[02:31] <MasterDuke> m: say (.SetHash, .BagHash, .MixHash given <A B>)

[02:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(SetHash(A B) BagHash(A, B) MixHash(A, B))␤»

[02:31] <perlawhirl> the plot thickens.

[02:31] <MasterDuke> same capitalization, but no comma

[02:32] <tony-o> timotimo: https://gist.github.com/tony-o/ec7420820aeb840d52be10504fe6ca14 # so far in the ORM workings, DBO will change to something else eventually

[02:33] <perlawhirl> I seem to recall a commit to ensure Set gist is always lexicographic (or at least alphabetic?) so maybe it was changed sometimes way back then.

[02:33] <perlawhirl> bisectable6: say Set(<A B>)

[02:33] <bisectable6> perlawhirl, Bisecting by output (old=2015.12 new=6e37c7f) because on both starting points the exit code is 0

[02:33] <MasterDuke> yeah, it's being sorted in .gist

[02:34] <perlawhirl> ^ that was the gist that sorted it... but yeah also removed comma. Seems it was lowercase before that, though

[02:36] <MasterDuke> m: say (.SetHash.perl, .BagHash.perl, .MixHash.perl given <A B>)

[02:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(SetHash.new("A","B") ("A","B").BagHash ("A","B").MixHash)␤»

[02:36] <MasterDuke> m: say (.Set.perl, .Bag.perl, .Mix.perl given <A B>)

[02:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(Set.new("A","B") ("A","B").Bag ("A","B").Mix)␤»

[02:37] <MasterDuke> Sets are consistently inconsistent!

[02:42] <MasterDuke> m: say (.Set.perl, .Bag.perl, .Mix.perl given ())

[02:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(set() bag() mix())␤»

[02:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6e37c7f04: OUTPUT: «(set() Bag() Mix())␤»

[02:43] <MasterDuke> and now they're inconsistently consistent!

[06:01] <jmerelo> Just created a file-co-modification graph for the perl6/doc repository. https://github.com/JJ/TPF-Grant/releases/tag/v0.1 If nothing else, it allows everyone to see the importance of the htmlify.p6 program

[06:03] <moritz> why does that scare me? :-)

[06:05] <jmerelo> Here's also the png https://github.com/JJ/TPF-Grant/blob/master/perl6-doc-graph.png Big balloon up on the top right-hand corner are the "old" pod, blob on the left is the current pod6 cluster, if you zoom you will see what are the most important (in the sense of co-modified with other files) files among the bunch. Maybe the .svg which is also there allows you to zoom a bit more, and of course there's the

[06:05] <jmerelo> .gephi file just in case you want to play with it.

[06:06] <jmerelo> moritz: not really unexpected, right?

[06:09] <jmerelo> moritz: if nothing else, it's witness to the fact that it's been developed in fits and starts, as new needs arose, and without a plan. Or tests. It's a great piece of work, but it's like an old carillion. You can't really move the sheep that dance when it's o'clock without everything coming down unraveled.

[06:14] <jmerelo> Just uploaded a zoom https://github.com/JJ/TPF-Grant/blob/master/illos/graph-zoom.png It highlights the most "important" pages among pod6: Num, 5to6perlop, and, of course, grammars. Also Signatures... These are "important" in the sense that they link different sub-groups of pages that appear together in commits

[06:15] <jmerelo> BTW, from today I'm staying at home (i.e. out of my office at the university) 3 days a week, to focus on the TPF grant.

[06:16] <jmerelo> It's going to be from Tuesday to Thursday, usually. Except for some weeks like next one, when I'm flying to Portugal for a tenure jury. 

[06:18] <jmerelo> I'll try to communicate my availability anyway. By default, Tuesday to Thursday, I'm (almost) exclusively a perl6/doc person.

[06:18] <jmerelo> I'll try to use these days to focus on the more heavyweight tasks, but I won't leave the rest, of course. Will try not to, anyway.

[15:53] *** mcmillhj joined
[15:54] <Ulti> it undoes the native compilation when your code at runtime hits upon a situation it knows the native code cant handle then interprets the bytecode etc. its not a single binary you could just output

[15:55] *** pharv left
[15:55] *** pharv joined
[15:56] <wanderer_> Ok, so the WiX installer will install my program plus the MoarVM dependency? 

[15:56] <Zoffix> I think so

[15:57] <Ulti> yeah plus the slug of bytecode for the runtime I assume

[15:58] <wanderer_> Ulti by that you mean the JIT compiler follows these steps "perl6 code->bytecode->native" or "perl6 code->native->(recur to bytecode when needed)"?

[15:59] *** mcmillhj left
[16:00] <Zoffix> wanderer_: no, when it sees a hot path in a running program, it swaps MoarVM bytecode to native code and places guards against its assumptions and if the guards fail, it reverts back to MoarVM bytecode

[16:00] <Ulti> its better to not think of the JIT compiler as a compiler and more as an optimiser of bytecode interpretation

[16:00] <Ulti> the Rakudo compiler emits bytecode for the target virtual machines

[16:01] <Ulti> thats what is "compiled" in the more familiar sense

[16:03] <wanderer_> Check. I think I get it.

[16:03] <Ulti> *not as

[16:03] <Ulti> dog

[16:03] <Ulti> DOH

[16:03] <Ulti> lol

[16:03] <Ulti> so much fail in so little time

[16:04] <Zoffix> ZofBot: why did the agnostic dyslexic spent the whole night awake? They were wondering whether there is a dog.

[16:04] <ZofBot> Zoffix, github

[16:04] <Zoffix> You're up for a brain reset...

[16:05] <Ulti> I think I am too

[16:06] <wanderer_> So Perl6 should in theory run as fast as Java and in practice faster than Python or Perl?

[16:06] <Zoffix> Yeah, eventually.

[16:07] <Ulti> wanderer_: if you're interested in the sort of theoretical best speeds check out NQP which is much closer to the virtual machine operations, and especially close to the MoarVM ones

[16:07] <El_Che> it's a question of time

[16:07] <El_Che> bad pun

[16:07] *** st_elmo joined
[16:09] *** mcmillhj joined
[16:09] <Ulti> wanderer_: there are sort of limitations with the features of the language by default, like if you dont say what type some variables/parameters are then that can change arbitrarily

[16:09] <Ulti> even if you define a type as some class in Perl 6 that can actually be mutated at runtime at the drop of a hat unless you promise not to

[16:10] <wanderer_> Ulti_: I'm really gonna need Perl6's high-level syntax contructs (e.g. list comprehension, esp. list comprehension in fact...) :'( If those aren't available in NQP my small project doesn't stand a chance.

[16:11] <Ulti> try doing some loops with no types then add in 'int' its faster because you've stated you're going to work within the native range and are happy for all the limitations and wins that brings

[16:11] <Zoffix> wanderer_: NQP isn't for end users. There's absolutely no promises made to users and no compatibility support is offered

[16:11] <Ulti> wanderer_: oh yeah I wouldnt do your project in NQP

[16:11] <Ulti> just if you were curious about possible future speeds

[16:11] <Ulti> Rakudo eventually should approach those speeds with sufficiently awesome optimisation

[16:12] <Ulti> and given I believed that a long time ago when we had no sufficiently awesome optimisations, I can now say that fairly confidently as a user is something that's happening

[16:13] <wanderer_> I'm so distressed... If an expert could only analyze my code and tell me something like: "yes, this would translate to perl 6 fairly well and execute fairly," then I'm all in.

[16:13] <Ulti> wanderer_: if you want to make your project faster start out writing it how you would write in any high level dynamic language, then you can profile where its slower

[16:14] <Ulti> wanderer_: perl6 --profile has a nice output ;)

[16:14] *** mcmillhj left
[16:14] <Ulti> wanderer_ do you have some code you are porting?

[16:15] <wanderer_> Yes from Wolfram. I was here the other day asking other questions.

[16:16] <wanderer_> Wolfram won't let me share my app unless my end-user pay $210 dollars for the Pro version of their runtime or I pay +$7,000 for an enterprise edition capable of saving the "pro" file

[16:16] <jmerelo> wanderer_: just give it a try. My experience with my own code is that everyone is very helpful to the point of speeding up the particular stuff I'm working on

[16:16] <jmerelo> Or else give you tips on how to run stuff faster.

[16:17] <Ulti> wanderer_: I have some code that a very long time ago took 10 minutes to execute, today it executes in under 1s where the startup time of perl6 is a large chunk of that under a second

[16:18] <wanderer_> Is anyone willing to give my app a try? You can copy-paste the source into the Wolfram Cloud free environment hit "shift-enter" and run it from there... Not a good deployment option (lol)

[16:18] <Ulti> just let people in here know if your code is slow and they'll at least record why and it might eventually get sorted

[16:18] * jmerelo starting to think I need a third screen

[16:19] <jmerelo> wanderer_: sure. Why not.

[16:43] <Zoffix> timotimo: what do you mean cut out?:

[16:43] <wanderer_> El_Che: Yes. Haha.  The cheaper alternative is suscribing to the Wolfram Cloud and deploy my app as a link. But... what happens, if I die and my subscription ends?

[16:44] <timotimo> Zoffix: like, the brochure comes with it, and you'd take your scissors that you always have with you like a normal person, and you cut it out

[16:44] <timotimo> yeah, that doesn't make terribly much sense

[16:45] <Zoffix> I've no idea what you're talking about.

[16:45] <timotimo> hm, i don't *think* i have a fever

[16:49] <El_Che> jmerelo: I did some tests some months ago and had something way smaller

[16:50] <El_Che> I think there should be 2 images: 1 with the kitchensync (star and whatever is useful, including repl modules), and one for real life deployments

[16:50] <El_Che> (as small as posible)

[16:51] <El_Che> no way

[16:51] <jmerelo> El_Che: test-perl6 includes some testing stuff, and it's 618 MB

[16:52] <jmerelo> El_Che: just give it a spin, docker pull jjmerelo/alpine-perl6

[16:52] <El_Che> my alpine rakudo image was around 50mb

[16:52] <jmerelo> El_Che: no way

[16:52] <jmerelo> :-)

[16:52] <El_Che> gcc bumps it to the 300-500mb range however

[16:53] <El_Che> (it includes zef)

[16:53] <timotimo> time to check out if tcc is good enough for moarvm

[16:53] <jmerelo> El_Che: I actually delete it, along with linux-headers and other stuff

[16:53] <jmerelo> So that should not be a problem.

[16:54] <El_Che> do you delete it in the same RUN command?

[16:54] *** Zoffix left
[16:54] <jmerelo> El_Che: right.

[16:54] <jmerelo> El_Che: why?

[16:54] <El_Che> aka do you have 1 RUN command with cmds linked with && ?

[16:54] <El_Che> otherwise you aren't deleting anything

[16:54] <El_Che> just hiding it in an underlaying layer

[16:55] <jmerelo> El_Che I see what you mean.

[16:55] <El_Che> there are 2 ways to create minimal images: - as few layers as possible (certainly RUNS)

[16:55] <El_Che> or multi img Dockerfiles

[16:55] <El_Che> the last is new

[16:55] <El_Che> but it requires a recent docker on the build client, not at runtime

[16:56] <jmerelo> El_Che: yep, just got that from a student. It's "from this_image that layer"

[16:56] <jmerelo> Something like that

[16:56] <jmerelo> El_Che: let me try that

[16:57] <El_Che> jmerelo: see the huge RUN: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile-alpine-amd64-3.6

[17:10] <timotimo> there is

[17:10] <timotimo> it's what you get when you "make spectest6"

[17:11] <[Coke]> so if you want to try to remove p5 from the docker container, maybe you can

[17:12] <jmerelo> timotimo, [Coke]: Let me try that...

[18:40] <Zoffix> Yeah

[18:40] <mspo> El_Che: I'm catching up

[18:40] <El_Che> :)

[18:40] <mspo> anyway I'm sure you've got it

[18:40] *** abraxxa left
[18:41] <El_Che> as long as petdance of pmichaud don't change the DNS, there is no way it will work

[18:41] <Zoffix> And we already have the hosting.

[18:41] *** darutoko left
[18:41] <mspo> adding ssl would be nice too

[18:41] <Zoffix> And the proxy is already setup even.

[18:49] <El_Che> jmerelo: is there a reason you use rakudobrew?

[18:51] <jmerelo> El_Che: mainly so that I can keep track of versions and eventually upload them as tags

[18:51] <jmerelo> El_Che: and, don't tell anyone, but it's what I use.

[18:51] <El_Che> jmerelo: ok

[18:51] <El_Che> a fan :)

[18:53] <jmerelo> El_Che: since they accepted this PR from me https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew/pull/17 I really fell in love with it. :-)

[18:54] <El_Che> let put a quick alternative POC

[18:55] <[Coke]> lester used to be involved back in the day. ISTR he was instrumental in the original perl6-vim plugin

[18:55] <[Coke]> Based on when I remember seeing him, would have been back in the parrot heydey

[18:55] <[Coke]> *heyday ?

[18:57] <El_Che> yeah, many people didn't survive parrot it seems

[18:58] <jmerelo> Can someone say what happened in a few words?

[18:58] <[Coke]> (back at the chicago tpc)

[18:59] <moritz> jmerelo: parrot died, that happened

[18:59] <El_Che> jmerelo: https://gist.github.com/nxadm/f925fdbf66b4a08975c6417ab7e3fc66

[19:00] <El_Che> (docker not parrot)

[19:00] <El_Che> got zef, no Linenoise

[19:00] <El_Che> (the 257MB is the one from my PR)

[19:02] <jmerelo> El_Che: wow

[19:03] <jmerelo> El_Che: we should maybe decide on different names

[19:04] <El_Che> jmerelo: yours is the canonical

[19:04] <El_Che> this is a poc based on my pkg

[19:04] <jmerelo> El_Che: looks amazing, anyway

[19:04] <jmerelo> Maybe I can try and build a perl 6 test container based on that...

[19:05] <El_Che> let me create a repo and put the Dockerfile in there

[19:06] <El_Che> my idea was to automatically create a container for each OS/reelase I provide a pkg for

[19:07] <El_Che> (or you can do that :) )

[19:08] <jmerelo> El_Che: That would be great. I can do it, but please feel free. 

[19:08] <El_Che> or we can create a common repo, whatever you want

[19:36] <El_Che> jmerelo: for the record, a "full" image (including gcc, make, some header files) is 198mb. The big file is good for a multi build process or for checking things out. The smallest 48mb is handier as a base image where you install stuff as needed and remove gcc+kitchensink afterwards

[20:00] <jmerelo> All those questions, and many more, will be answered by (maybe) the end of next week.
