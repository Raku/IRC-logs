[00:14] <Garland_g[m]> I think function pointers are the reverse of what I need here. I need to take a function from perl6-land and store it in a CStruct.

[00:16] <timotimo> right, callbacks

[00:16] <timotimo> those also exist

[00:16] <timotimo> i wonder if the libssh bindings have any of those

[00:16] <timotimo> as examples

[00:24] <Garland_g[m]> My naive implementation looks something like: class Thing is repr('CStruct') { has Pointer $.method; submethod BUILD(method => &method) { $!method = &method } }

[00:25] <timotimo> i think you want an actual callable in there, but i'm not sure

[00:25] <timotimo> or perhaps you have to nativecast?

[00:27] <Garland_g[m]> Nativecast on &method complains about receiving a P6Opaque (Block)

[00:28] <timotimo> ah, mhm

[00:31] <Garland_g[m]> Trying to assign to a Pointer attribute gives me "cannot assign to an immutable value."

[00:31] <timotimo> that's potentially just missing "is rw"

[00:33] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v nolsen7

[00:36] <Garland_g[m]> Whoops. I forgot to add "is rw" to my example, but I have it in my code.

[00:37] <timotimo> OK, i see now that libssh hasn't got CStruct in it

[01:08] <ToddAndMargo> Hi All,  How do I get "contains" to tell me if a fragment exists starting at the beginning of the string?

[01:08] <ToddAndMargo> p6 'my $x="-v abc"; if $x.contains( "^-v" ) {say "yes"}else{say "no"};'

[01:10] <timotimo> m: my $x = "-v abc"; say $x.starts-with("-v")

[18:47] <timotimo> can you put the text up on a nopaste site or something?

[18:48] <DavdiChipman> I wil once I've retried compiling things. 

[18:48] <DavdiChipman> I saw a path in the error output that made litle sense given the way the source archive was arranged.

[18:58] <DavdiChipman> Sorry for taking so long. Here you go: https://pastebin.com/ubeVGuQu

[18:59] <jnthn> Ah, it isn't even getting to NQP, it's MoarVM that's got a bunch of compiler errors.

[19:00] <jnthn> Which isn't so surprising; MoarVM depends on libuv, and until recently that didn't support cygwin. I believe it does now, but probably there's other work needed for that to build on cygwin.

[19:01] <DavdiChipman> Huh, OK... Thanks, jnthn

[19:01] <jnthn> I know little about cygwin, but glancing the errors it seems it's trying to compile uses of the Win32 API
