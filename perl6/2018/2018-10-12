[08:36] <scimon> So after giving a talk about command line scripts with Perl6 last night I get home read my email and find out the bit I did about Auto Documentation is already out of date.

[08:36] <yoleaux> 08:10Z <lizmat> scimon: what you told about yesterday will continue to work until at least 5.e

[08:36] <yoleaux> 08:14Z <lizmat> scimon: and judging from your slides, you didn't mention the internals apart from $*USAGE, and that will stay

[08:36] <yoleaux> 08:14Z <lizmat> scimon: all changes are under the hood for all of your viewers

[08:37] <scimon> lizmat: I guess you meant 6.e ? 

[08:37] <lizmat> scimon: so what part is out of date ?

[08:37] <lizmat> 6.e, yeah, duh :-)

[08:37] <scimon> Will you still be able to query $*USAGE ? Looking at the code changes I wasn't sure? If so I think it's OK :)

[08:38] <lizmat> yes, $*USAGE continues to  work

[08:38] <lizmat> but indeed, let me add tests for that

[08:38] <scimon> I think it went over well with people. :)

[08:38] <jmerelo> scimon: great. Guess you'll publish, or have already published it, somewhere, right?

[08:42] <scimon> The slides are up on Slideshare. Video will hopefully be published later.

[09:44] <leont> Running into ¬´Expected MAST::Frame, but didn't get one¬ª (on latest Rakudo release), not understanding at all what's going on

[09:44] <yoleaux> 10 Oct 2018 19:04Z <lizmat> leont: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/33c241532b

[09:45] <timotimo> leont: the compiler is exploding

[09:45] <leont> That must was obvious

[09:45] <leont> (or actually the VM)

[09:45] * lizmat will clone and look at the fallout

[09:46] <timotimo> well, at least it's probably not something in your code, at least not directly

[09:46] <lizmat> leont: which code creates the explosion ?

[09:46] <leont> Thing is, it dies on ¬´use TAP;¬ª, where in other places (like prove6) that works fine

[09:47] <timotimo> have you tried deleting all precomp files?

[09:48] <leont> Got a one-liner for that?

[09:48] <leont> (not sure where "all" is)

[09:49] *** domidumont left
[09:49] <timotimo> if you use RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG (or something similar) i believe it will print details including what precomp files it's loading perhaps?

[09:49] <timotimo> not sure if that's a good idea

[09:55] <lizmat> leont: I just re-installed Tap::Harness (right?) and 'use TAP' does not do anything strange for me

[10:10] <woolfy> To all who sent us a talk proposal: thank you.  Maybe you can try to get into the main halls.  The deadline for sending in talk proposals is end of tomorrow, Saturday, October 13:  https://fosdem.org/2019/news/2018-08-10-call-for-participation/

[10:12] <lizmat> could you gist the code ?

[10:13] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v newbie1

[10:16] <lizmat> ===SORRY!===

[10:16] <lizmat> Tap is a builtin type, not an external module

[10:16] <lizmat> where Foo.pm6 is 'use TAP'

[10:17] <leont> Huh

[10:17] <leont> Tap != TAP

[10:18] <leont> Weird

[10:18] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v pecastro

[10:18] <lizmat> indeed

[10:18] <lizmat> I assume you are on HEAD, right ?

[10:21] <scimon> timotimo: So off the top of my head -i would be nice -a and -F could be interesting but the one I personally would really like it -E being an alias for -e .

[10:21] <timotimo> -E being an alias for -e?

[10:21] <scimon> Yup.

[10:21] <timotimo> like, literally no difference between the two?

[10:21] <scimon> Yup

[10:21] <timotimo> as a non-perl5-er i don't like it :)

[10:22] <lizmat> yeah, if you're coming from perl 5, you got used to using '-E' if you wanted to be able to 'say' something

[10:22] <scimon> Because I write Command line stuff in both Perl5 and Perl6 and like say

[10:22] <scimon> (I'm not that bothered. I'm now at the point I'm MORE likely use -e and say in Perl5 then use -E in Perl6. But it would be a nice little treat for others). 

[10:23] <leont> I'm on 2018.09 release

[10:23] <scimon> Of all the ones I mentioned I think -i might be the most useful. 

[10:23] <lizmat> leont: a *lot* has happened since then..

[10:23] <scimon> the number of times I've done perl -i~ -lpe 's/something/else/g' * in my life is quite high. 

[10:24] <leont> Ah, I see

[10:24] <lizmat> I mean, *really* a *lot*

[10:26] <El_Che> bad news: https://wendyga.wordpress.com/2018/10/12/no-devroom-for-perl-at-fosdem-2019/

[10:59] <leont> Might just wait until 2018.10 then. No point in releasing code people can't use anyway.

[11:00] <lizmat> leont: well, I would like to know if the API I devised yesterday actually makes sense

[11:00] <lizmat> or that I have overlooked somethinng

[11:00] <leont> The Getopt one?

[11:00] <lizmat> yeah

[11:02] <leont> GENERATE-USAGE is the tricky one at this stage, I think

[11:03] <leont> ARGS-TO-CAPTURE does the obvious thing

[11:04] <lizmat> leont: why is GENERATE-USAGE the tricky one ?

[11:05] <leont> Because reimplementing it hasn't been done before

[11:05] <leont> But I think passing it Callable and Capture should be all that's needed, yeah

[11:05] <lizmat> ah, well you *don't* have to

[11:06] <leont> True, that is also good

[11:06] <lizmat> all intercept vectors are optional

[11:50] <lizmat> ++holyghost 

[11:51] <holyghost> I can start the game statisical theory package I wanted to make

[11:54] <scimon> lizmat: I'll ask again. (I've asked a couple of times here before) is hidden-from-USAGE isn't documented anywhere but as a fan of the auto generated usage I think it's kinda useful. Should it be documented or is it one of those things we don't talk about?

[11:54] <lizmat> it's most definitely intended to be documented

[11:55] <lizmat> I'l do that, as I'm rewriting the docs for MAIN at the moment into a separate "command line interface" chapter

[19:24] <Zoffix> Demos[m]: fairly sure you don't need `is export` there, as that would be an `our` class, and thus visible elsewhere by default anyway. So it'd be just `unit class BlahBlah;`

[19:55] <Zoffix> Was just pondering birdrock's comments about fast calculation, but very slow rendering of a large Int... The slowness comes from these two mp_* routine calls: https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L955-L963 and I was pondering if there were a way to do some sort of a similar fast-path trick one of those routines got for binary:

[19:55] <Zoffix> https://github.com/MoarVM/libtommath/blob/289e346bb9b968377ffbbbe6876342fedda4e072/bn_mp_radix_size.c#L37-L41

[19:55] <Zoffix> except for decimal.

[19:56] <Zoffix> Or at least do something for something digits instead of doing `mp_div_d` for every digit basically (in base 10)

[20:58] <timotimo> Xliff: usually you can "call MVM_dump_backtrace(tc)" after going "up" often enough to reach a frame where "tc" is available (usually the first argument)

[21:00] <tbrowder___>  [Coke] The Perl Foundation website does not show TPC NA 2019 on the Events tab on the home page. Yapc.org shows YAPC::NA 2018, and Perlconference.us shows The Perl Conference in 2019 will be in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA, but it doesn‚Äôt show dates.  It seems to me that the Perl Foundation ought to be the canonical place to show major Perl events.

[21:34] <Xliff> lizmat: Gist updated. It works with one type in the array, but not with anything more than one.

[21:52] <lizmat> Xliff: it's not so strange once you realize how NativeCall really works  :-)

[21:53] <Xliff> Yeah, but when working on large projects, forgetting type sizes is embarassing. %-)

[21:58] <lizmat> good to hear :-)

[21:59] <tbrowder___> used MAIN again a few days ago and it takes some trial and error with the old doc to get it working just right.

[21:59] <tbrowder___> i look forward to using the new info, thanks!

[22:49] <timotimo> Xliff: gdb can't know how our jit stack frames work, so you quite often can't "up" past the JIT; try re-running with MVM_JIT_DISABLE=yes and see if it still crashes

[22:49] <timotimo> oh, it looks like you solved the issue
