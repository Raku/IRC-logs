[01:58] <TimToady> vrurg: seems like it could be a buglet

[01:58] <TimToady> but use of "does" at runtime is always a bit...fraught...

[01:58] <vrurg> TimToady: reported already: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2282

[01:58] <TimToady> vrurg++

[02:00] <vrurg> Being used accurately dynamic role application allows for some pretty neat tricks. 

[02:01] <vrurg> In my case application object would depend on what command was used on CLI. Plugin-like behavior.

[17:48] <ab6tract> read a great shout out to Perl 6 today: http://esoteric.codes/blog/the-128-language-quine-relay

[17:49] <ab6tract> a quine that transforms through 128 languages is astonishing enough.. but here's a choice quote: "Piet, the language that uses images as source code (read the interview with Piet‚Äôs creator here) was a bit easier as it came after Perl 6, which bundles Zlib as standard library, making it straightforward to generate a PNG file. Had it followed, say, brainfuck, it would have been a much larger challenge."

[19:33] <Zoffix> You can do this, as long as the variables don't vary much (each variant creates a new role or something along those lines)
