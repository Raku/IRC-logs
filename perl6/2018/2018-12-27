[06:46] <Xliff> Hope everyone is enjoying a Happy Holiday Season.

[06:55] <holyghost> Xliff : would you know where to put the docs in Bayes/Learn.pm6 ?

[06:58] <holyghost> Xliff : happy holidays :-)

[07:05] <Xliff> holyghost: :)

[07:05] <Xliff> holyghost: Confused. What docs?

[07:05] <Xliff> If it's committed, I'll take a look in a minute. 

[07:05] <Xliff> (and pushed)

[07:06] <holyghost> Xliff : I need to write docs for Bayes::Learn, jmerelo told me I had to put in a Learn.pm6 file for docs

[07:07] <holyghost> (and pushed) ?

[07:09] <holyghost> anyway, I'll ask JJ later on today

[07:13] <holyghost> .tell jmerelo Could you explain how to put docs with Learn.pm6 in Bayes::Learn ?

[07:13] <yoleaux> holyghost: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[07:16] <Xliff> holyghost: Do you have the docs written? If so, you can add POD comments and those can become your docs.

[07:19] <holyghost> ok, I'll write a pod6 later on then, thx Xliff

[07:20] <holyghost> I'm too drunk now :-) I'll probably best wait until next week

[08:30] <jmerelo> I have been unable to discover where the official perl6 documentation container was hosted. There's a perl6 organization in Docker Hub, but I have no idea how to work with it or if I have access to it

[08:30] <yoleaux> 07:13Z <holyghost> jmerelo: Could you explain how to put docs with Learn.pm6 in Bayes::Learn ?

[08:30] <jmerelo> .tell holyghost you can check out my Perl6 advent calendar entry https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2018/12/02/

[08:30] <yoleaux> jmerelo: I'll pass your message to holyghost.

[08:32] <jmerelo> Anyway, I have created it with my tag, hopefully nobody minds, and of course I don't mind if somebody manages to put it under the perl6/ namespace in docker.

[08:32] <jmerelo> It's going to be built automatically every time we push to master, and you'll be able to use it with docker pull jjmerelo/perl6-doc

[09:47] <sjn> El_Che: he asked if that image was available on OpenShift, I answered "I don't know, maybe El_Che knows?"

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: where?

[09:59] <Xliff> LOL!

[10:00] <Xliff> Sorry. Was busy reading jmerelo's Advent post from 12/02

[10:01] <Xliff> Now I think I need to add a background color. :/

[10:01] <Xliff> .oO( Wonder how long that will take me... )

[10:03] *** kurahaupo left
[10:05] <Xliff> Answer... not that long. :)

[10:06] <El_Che> sjn: if Openshift can pull Docker images, sure.

[10:07] <El_Che> but I must say, with containers and orchestrators I completely fail to see the point of openshift :)

[10:08] <sjn> El_Che: it's good for visibility

[10:09] <sjn> it's heavily used, and by being in that index, we show those users that Perl 6 is "available"

[10:09] <sjn> "exists"

[10:10] <El_Che> yeah, my point is that openshift shifted (ho-ho-ho) to containers and kubernetes, so I expect it uses upstream Docker registry

[10:11] <El_Che> but I can be wrong

[10:11] <El_Che> I been a while since I looked at OpenShift and asked "why"

[10:11] <El_Che> Ok, posing the question in a full room Red Hat paid event made it somewhat awkward and funny, but still :)

[10:17] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Better version with background color. I will brighten the text in a sec.

[10:20] <jmerelo> Xliff: did you like it?

[10:20] <jmerelo> sjn: there are quite  few Perl 6 docker containers, official and otherwise...

[10:21] <jmerelo> And El_Che is right about OpenShift. It was a very nice PaaS, but now it's got OpenShift.io, which I can't figure out, and OpenShift 3 "online", which kicked me out after I didn't create a project in 90 days.

[10:27] <Xliff> jmerelo: I learned something, therefore it is good!

[10:27] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/stats/OutputGraph-20181227-0341.svg <-- Better version

[10:28] <Xliff> Note that 12/21 results are WAY higher than 12/27. And for a laugh, see if you can find the ones from Christmas.

[10:28] <jmerelo> Xliff: thanks!

[10:28] <jmerelo> Xliff: those are benchmarks? 

[10:28] <Xliff> jmerelo: Compile times from my current obsession.

[10:28] <Xliff> More like parse times, but that's the lion's share of --stagestats

[17:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «(b)␤»

[17:07] <jmerelo> Well

[17:07] <jmerelo> Weveral things

[17:08] <jmerelo> %a<foo> returns a single element, which is a list. You need to de-containerize it (via <> to convert it in a list)

[17:08] <jmerelo> That's why you have couple of parentheses above.

[17:08] <jmerelo> Putting grep behind listifies, which has the same effect.

[17:10] <melezhik> m: my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say grep{ $_ eq "b" } %a<foo><>

[17:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    a used at line 1␤␤»

[17:10] <melezhik> ?

[17:11] <melezhik> m: my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say grep{( $_ eq "b" )} %a<foo><>

[17:11] <melezhik> I get stuck ):

[17:11] <melezhik> I wish perl6 grep would be more friendly ... to be honest ...

[17:12] *** CoderPuppy joined
[17:12] <lizmat> what's unfriendly about grep in Perl 6 ?

[17:12] *** cpup left
[17:12] <lizmat> as opposed to Perl 5 I assume, melezhik?

[17:12] <melezhik> it is complicated ... how can I make my code working?

[17:12] <melezhik> yes

[17:12] <jmerelo> m: my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say grep{ $_ eq "b" }, %a<foo><>

[17:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Calling grep() will never work with signature of the proto (Mu, |)␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say 7⏏5grep{ $_ eq "b" }, %a<foo><>␤»

[17:13] <jmerelo> melezhik: ^^^

[17:13] <jmerelo> m: my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say grep { $_ eq "b" }, %a<foo>.list

[17:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «(b)␤»

[17:13] <melezhik> yeah ...

[17:13] <jmerelo> melezhik: you gotta be careful with spaces and commas...

[17:13] <melezhik> thanks ... jmerelo:

[17:13] <jmerelo> melezhik: eventually you'll do fine, don't worry :-)

[17:14] <melezhik> yes ... this is kinda a level of friendliness ... it's not complain ... just my personal feeling ... I need to get used to that ... thanks guys 

[17:14] <lizmat> m: my %a; %a<foo> := ("a", "b", "c"); say grep { $_ eq "b" }, %a<foo>   # alternate solution

[17:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «(b)␤»

[17:15] <lizmat> melezhik: depending on how you initialize the hash

[17:15] <jmerelo> melezhik: good luck, and you where to find us :-) Happy season greetings, too.

[17:15] <melezhik> ah, oh ,, thanks for that lizmat: 

[17:16] <melezhik> sure ... the perl6 community is friendly of course ((-; 

[17:18] <lizmat> m: my %a is Map = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say grep { $_ eq "b" }, %a<foo>   # yet another alternative

[17:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 236351ade: OUTPUT: «(b)␤»

[17:18] <lizmat> in a map, the values are never containerized

[17:18] <lizmat> so the grep doesn't need to decontainerize them   

[17:18] <lizmat> melezhik ^^^

[17:20] <melezhik> yeah ... I have straight forward %f = () ... so need to add .list  here  not for Map? ... I see ... thanks lizmat:

[17:20] <lizmat> not for my %h is Map  :-)

[17:20] <melezhik> yeah :-)

[17:20] <lizmat> it actually saves on memory as well

[17:21] <melezhik> yeah ... worth to add some examples to perl6 doc on grep/map?

[17:21] <lizmat> basically, for all Hashes that you initialize and not change, the "is Map" makes sense

[17:21] <melezhik> good thing ...

[18:03] <jmerelo> I had already created the alpine-based containers, but these containers will be plug-in compatible with the rakudo-start ones, but will have many more versions.

[18:04] <jmerelo> Still getting built in docker hub, but I expect to have them ready this evening. And then, a Perl 6 documentation container (which is the thing that started the yak shaving)

[20:12] <Voldenet> is there any shorter way of writing `given $x { when "[" { 1 }; when "]" { 2 }; default { 0 }}`?

[20:14] <jmerelo> Voldenet: you can pre-initialize a hash and just use the hash. 

[20:14] <Juerd> { "[" => 1, "]" => 2 }{ $x } // 0

[20:18] <melezhik> lizmat: jmerelo: based on my today experience on learning perl6/grep/sort. - kinda interactive console Perl6 tutorial for those who need "get things done" - https://asciinema.org/a/218669 (https://github.com/melezhik/p6-GTDT), any thoughts? it's just an idea ... 

[20:21] <b2gills> melezhik: I generally prefer the method form of grep/sort/map `@a.grep({CODE})`

[20:21] <b2gills> m: my %a = %( foo => ("a", "b", "c")); say %a<foo>.grep({ $_ eq "b" }).sort({.a cmp .b})
