[01:25] <benjikun> Yeah, it could

[01:25] <AlexDaniel> like maybe we can write a script that'd send a bunch of PRs to these modules, just tweaking the META6.json file to list the dependency

[01:25] <benjikun> Yeah that could be nice, true

[01:26] <benjikun> some amount of automating the detection of problems in the p6 ecosystem could be very good for us, I think

[01:28] <AlexDaniel> for now just put `native dependency` label and close if it installs with that dependency satisfied

[09:10] <benjikun> Hi Kaiepi

[09:11] <benjikun> Are you planning on making anymore Net:: modules?

[09:11] <Kaiepi> possibly

[09:11] <Kaiepi> i'm busy with net::telnet atm

[09:12] <benjikun> I see

[09:13] <benjikun> Net::ICMP and Net::NNTP seem like fairly low-work modules that could be nice to implement

[09:14] <benjikun> Both wanted on the wanted modules page

[09:17] <Kaiepi> i'll take a look

[09:19] <benjikun> :)

[09:22] <jmerelo> benjikun: I'd be surprised if people are still using NNTP, but who knows...

[10:17] <sena_kun> is auth field in META mandatory?

[10:17] <jmerelo> sena_kun: pretty much, yes.

[10:18] <sena_kun> jmerelo, yup, thanks.

[10:19] <sena_kun> hmm, not really, it seems.

[10:21] <tbrowder_> fyi, i’m merging my rakudo PR #2171 later today if there are no objections, it implements pod =defn

[10:21] <jmerelo> sena_kun: no? I thought so. It's displayed in the ecosystem along with the module name. And it allows to have several modules with the same name, different authors

[10:21] <jmerelo> tbrowder_++

[10:22] <lizmat> tbrowder_++

[10:23] <sena_kun> jmerelo, yes, I thought so, but it seems to be not really "enforced" to say (near) every module in ecosystem has it. E.g. ours cro modules use only `authors` field, as well as e.g. Java::Generate. Those I can fix, but now I cannot claim that every module use it <- this is what I was trying to ask. :)

[10:31] <jmerelo> sena_kun: that's right, I wouldn't say it's checked the way the license, for instance, is. It's good to have, anyway.

[14:26] <pochi> what's a good way of expressing "match these 3 things in any order, but each at most once"?

[14:27] <sena_kun> xor?

[14:27] <sena_kun> what do you mean by matching, pochi?

[14:27] <pochi> I have 3 sections in a file I want to match with a grammar

[14:29] <sena_kun> grammar Foo { ... rule/regex/token foo { <rule-a> | <rule-b> | <rule-c> } ... } <- something like that?

[14:29] <pochi> wouldnt that match rule-a, then don't try the rest?

[14:30] <sena_kun> it will. do you want a random order?

[14:30] <pochi> yes

[14:30] <sena_kun> ah.

[14:31] <sena_kun> hmmm...

[14:31] <pochi> the only solution I can come up with is catching duplicate sections in the actions file

[14:31] <pochi> keeping a %seen-sections variable, but that didn't feel very clean

[16:15] <Xliff> Digest::MurmurHash3 looks to test just fine, however it won't install via zef because the build "fails", when in fact it is just fine. 

[16:17] <timotimo> i find Build.pm a bit difficult to debug in general

[16:17] <timotimo> does murmurhash3 use something like librarymake?

[16:17] <timotimo> perhaps the "makefile from json" feature we've got in META6.json now (do we?) is right for that

[16:18] <Xliff> timotimo: It uses Library make to build a Docker image to run its tests.

[16:18] <timotimo> oh? that's interesting

[16:18] <Xliff> Yeah. It uses the last Rakudo star.

[16:18] <Xliff> But what I don't get is why it says the build fails.

[16:19] <Xliff> Maybe it's because it's looking for a file in resource?

[16:22] <timotimo> i'm not sure how exactly the docker part fits in there

[16:22] <Xliff> Build process fails because "make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.

[16:22] <Xliff> "

[16:22] <Xliff> I'm not quite sure how that is a failure.

[16:22] <timotimo> yeah, that sounds like "it's already finished"

[16:23] <jmerelo> Xliff, timotimo: I submitted this pull request: https://github.com/yowcow/p6-Digest-MurmurHash3/pull/10

[16:23] <jmerelo> But it's been apparently changed... See the comments.

[16:23] <jmerelo> I think you have to do zef build . before zef install .

[16:23] <jmerelo> it says so in that comment; don't know if anywhere else...

[16:24] <timotimo> Configure.pl6?

[16:24] <timotimo> i think i'm kind of confused

[16:24] <Xliff> No. Looking at everything, the install should build, and then test.

[16:25] <timotimo> right

[16:25] <jmerelo> timotimo: it was deleted.

[16:25] <Xliff> Even with his changes, the install still fails because "make" fails.

[16:25] <Xliff> And make isn't really failing, it's just saying: "There's nothing to be done"

[16:25] <jmerelo> Xliff: hum

[16:26] <timotimo> does LibraryMake do some extra checks?

[16:29] <yoleaux> 10:37Z <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Been looking at that. Turns out it's not so simple to fix, and the fix that does land will likely force an API change in the module.

[17:15] <AlexDaniel> that's not old

[17:16] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: not really, except basically he's not come back to GitHub after that. And the PR is from april. And there are interesting modules, like Net::Jupyter, that depend on that.

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> yeah but Net::Jupyter is by the same author

[17:16] <AlexDaniel> so just leave it be

[17:17] <El_Che> I think only modules that will end in core should be adopted by an official org

[17:17] <El_Che> otherwise you're just moving tombs

[17:17] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: but that one, and Log::ZMQ, fail because of that tiny error.

[17:17] <jmerelo> El_Che: there are several modules adopted by the Perl 6 org that have nothing to do with core.

[17:18] <El_Che> jmerelo: yes, I find it a bad idea

[17:18] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel, El_Che: OK, what would be the way of adopting it myself then?

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: so? clone ugexe's fork, install the module, then try to install other modules that depend on it

[17:18] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: if they work, close corresponding issues

[17:19] <AlexDaniel> and leave it be… :)

[17:22] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: ugexe's fork is changing quotes by <>. It's no big deal... I don't think the unbitrot issue should be closed, since that would still not be in the official repo.

[17:22] <El_Che> yeah, that's better

[17:22] <AlexDaniel> but don't adopt a module that has been inactive for just 8 months… especilaly if you're not ready to maintain in actively

[17:22] <AlexDaniel> it*

[17:23] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I find waiting for a time reasonable, as long as the person has been active anywhere else in GitHub. But that's not the case.

[18:59] <AlexDaniel> pong? :)

[18:59] <timotimo> success

[18:59] <xinming> yea, It worked.

[18:59] <xinming> In DBIish, when we do something like  my $sth = $db.prepare(..);  $sth.execute; $sth.row;   <--- In this cause, Is it possible to get the sth directly?

[18:59] <xinming> for now, When I try $db.do('...');   the sth returned can't return rows.

[19:00] <timotimo> i think do just can't give values?

[19:00] <mst> yeah, you'd want it to provide an equivalent of selectall_arrayref or something

[19:00] <xinming> 'do' should not be used for statements that return rows

[19:01] <timotimo> that'd be .allrows(:array-of-array)

[19:01] <xinming> this is the error, So I'm think wether there is something short

[19:01] <xinming> for now, only  my $sth = $db.prepare(...);  $sth.execute;  $sth.row   worked.

[19:01] <xinming> do we need other shortcuts?

[19:02] <timotimo> don't forget about $sth.finish

[19:02] <moritz> wanting just one row as an answer happens quite often

[19:03] <moritz> so maybe there is a use case for that

[19:03] <tim> How does Perl 6 compare to Perl 5 as far as memory efficiency is concerned?  I've a 2D array of 8-bit values I need to process in a limited amount of RAM.

[19:03] <moritz> now we need a good name...

[19:03] <timotimo> tim: there's a bunch of overhead from the runtime, but we can handle arrays of small integers very well.

[19:04] <xinming> moritz: Yes, It's ofen, something simple select with one row and return a hash for the data.

[19:04] <tim> Does the method/approach/structure have a name that I can look up?

[19:04] <timotimo> just "native arrays" i think?

[19:04] <timotimo> you just need "my int8 @foo" and you're golden

[19:05] <timotimo> the overhead i'm refering to is that an empty perl6 program already uses ~75 megabytes of ram to run, which includes compilation and such

[19:06] <timotimo> turning off the dynamic optimizer makes stuff slower, but saves about 9 megabytes on the empty program, and more as the program grows

[19:07] <tim> The runtime doesn't matter too much, I'm at the stage where I need to optimise some loops

[19:07] <timotimo> ah, i meant "the runtime environment" rather than "the time it takes to run"

[19:07] <xinming> I'm thinking that probably, perl6 won't be as fast as we can have in perl5 for a long time.

[19:08] <timotimo> in isolated cases we're already faster than perl5 if you know what you're doing, but it's easy to accidentally find something that's extremely slow

[19:08] <timotimo> on the upside, changes to make things faster are sometimes just single word or line changes

[19:08] <timotimo> and if you find something annoyingly slow, we'll always appreciate a little report on the channel so we can figure out what we can improve in rakudo

[19:09] <timotimo> or, if you prefer, figure out how we/you can make your program faster

[19:09] <tim> So, if I use the my int8 @foo approach, how much memory would a 64x64 array of 8-bit ints (4096 values) actually take op?  Approximately?

[19:11] <timotimo> 4 kilobytes for the data itself, maybe a hundred bytes for the array object, and then whatever else the program has, including stack frames, bytecode, data recorded for the optimizer, temporary objects created to box your int values

[19:11] <tim> I need to fit certain things inside of L1 and L2 caches... which are measured in kB

[19:11] <timotimo> +/- the fact that the nursery stays the same size of 4 megabytes, which if your objects all die young will "absorb" pretty much every allocation you may have

[19:12] <timotimo> "my int8 @foo" of 4k values will keep the values themselves as one long contiguous piece of memory

[19:12] <tim> Nursery?

[19:12] <tim> Is that like global garbage collection?

[19:13] <timotimo> yes, perl6 is garbage collected

[19:13] <timotimo> well, it is on moarvm, and on the jvm/truffle as well as node.js/browser

[19:14] <timotimo> for a native int or num array, the garbage collector can basically just ignore the data region and only look at the object that represents the array, which is far smaller

[19:14] <timotimo> i'm not too good at explaining that %)

[19:16] <tim> But that garbage collector only comes into play when the object is destroyed, correct?  Not when values in the array are being read or updated?

[19:19] <timotimo> it's not that easy

[19:20] <timotimo> when you pass values from the array around, like to functions that want to have them as a read-write scalar variable, we'll build a little object that gives access to one spot in the array

[19:20] *** tokomer left
[19:20] <timotimo> and when you use method calls on the values from inside the array, they'll first be boxed into Int objects

[19:20] <timotimo> objects that die soon after they get created are very, very cheap to GC

[19:20] *** kerframil joined
[19:20] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kerframil

[19:21] <timotimo> you can use the built-in profiler (on moarvm) to see what functions allocate what objects, and how much time is spent doing GC

[19:21] <timotimo> just perl6 --profile yourprogram.p6

[19:23] <tim> Not written in P6 (yet).  I'm tyring to work out if it is feasible first.

[19:24] <timotimo> not very easy to say without a bit of experimentation

[19:24] <tim> Your example made ti sound like passing references to the value as a parameter.  If I don't do a function call and just process them directly... that eliminates all the 'boxing', correct?

[19:25] <timotimo> it should, but there are cases that the optimizer still fails at

[19:26] <tim> Hmmm...  Well I think I need to grab a cup of tea and look into native arrays some more.

[19:26] <tim> Thanks for your help timotimo!

[23:56] <MasterDuke> oh damn, that's nice

[23:57] <MasterDuke> is it faster that the current one for large/deep graphs?

[23:58] <timotimo> haven't tried it yet, but at the moment it dumbly recalculates the breadcrumbs for every piece you click on, even when going upwards

[23:58] <timotimo> the main reason the old one is so slow is the icicle graph at the top

[23:58] <timotimo> i'll have to make sure my new one performs extremely well.
