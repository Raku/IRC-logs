[01:45] <kjk> so I'm using this mi6 tool to help with authoring a module, and I'm trying to upload my module to cpan, but it says I should prepare a ~/.pause file, I'm not sure what to put in there? I'm guessing it should contain my credential, but in what format?

[01:48] <timotimo> kjk: one line is "user KJKPAN", the next line is "password GoodBagels"

[01:49] <timotimo> end it with a newline i guess?

[01:52] <kjk> hmm upload failed with an error: 599 Internal Exception, https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

[01:53] <kjk> however, I see the files in PAUSE

[02:07] <kjk> hmm, does that message mean it's successful?

[02:09] <kjk> if yes, I kind of wish it wasn't successful lol, coz I wanted to change the name of the module to just P6Repl::Helper, i.e., no 's' at the end.

[02:13] <kjk> ok that's it, I'm renaming it. just scheduled a delete of the files on PAUSE, hope it's ok.

[09:59] <Altreus> Apparently a Promise.in is already vowed? How would one set up an event for the future, like a timeout, but then cancel it if the thing being timed out succeeds first?

[10:00] <Altreus> I thought I would just make a Promise.in and then break it if the timeout is not needed

[10:00] <lizmat> Altreus: you don't: the promise will be kept and the object will be removed automatically when the GC kicks in

[10:01] <Altreus> But the promise is a timeout

[10:01] <Altreus> if it's kept, the connection is closed

[10:01] *** ChoHag left
[10:01] *** benjikun joined
[10:01] <Altreus> Presumably there's a better way of setting up an alarm like this, such that it can be cancelled

[10:02] <lizmat> Altreus: please show the code, I think there's some misunderstanding

[10:02] <Altreus> let me commit the wip :)

[10:03] <Altreus> lizmat: https://github.com/kawaiiforums/p6-api-discord/blob/wip/lib/API/Discord.pm6

[10:03] <Altreus> You see I set up $!hb-timeout on line 76

[10:03] <Altreus> The idea is that if the heartbeat is acknowledged, I cancel the timeout

[10:03] <Altreus> if it's not, I close the connection

[10:04] <Altreus> But I can't work out how to cancel the timeout

[10:04] <Altreus> The *other* problem is that if I try to break a promise like this in a trivial script, I get an error

[10:04] <Altreus> but in this situation I do not

[10:05] *** stmuk_ joined
[10:06] <lizmat> hmmm... indeed, that also seems to have the same logical issue as: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Promise#method_in

[10:07] <Altreus> I mean it does seem like I should be able to not timeout if the proc finishes first

[10:07] <Altreus> I guess I can set it up in a slightly more complex way so the then block closes over state it can later read

[10:07] *** stmuk left
[10:07] <lizmat> I think that's the way to do it now

[10:08] <lizmat> I think we want Promise.in / at to return an augmented promise that you can call "cancel" on

[10:08] <Altreus> or to not be avowed so you can break it

[10:08] <Altreus> I'm surprised trying to break it in this code does not cause an error

[10:09] <lizmat> I just realize that the implementation of Promise.in / at predates the cancellation feature of ThreadPoolScheduler.cue

[10:09] <Altreus> aha

[10:09] <Altreus> Well this is why we need to try writing things in perl6 :D

[10:09] <Altreus> find all the kinks

[10:10] <lizmat> yes, please continue to do so!

[10:10] <jnthn> my $cancelled = Promise.new; Promise.anyof(Promise.in(5), $cancelled).then({ unless $cancelled { ...do stuff... } });

[10:11] <Altreus> ah that's nicer than a new member

[10:13] *** ChoHag joined
[10:14] <lizmat> jnthn: how do you feel of adding a "cancel" method on the Promise returned by .in / .at ?

[10:14] <jnthn> Not convinced that's the right way to do it at all.

[10:15] <Altreus> It feels tidier to never run the code than to run the code and check if you really want to

[10:15] <Altreus> Whenever I have something like promises it strikes me that I should almost never have to write another if

[10:15] <lizmat> well, I guess there's still a race condition

[10:16] <jnthn> Well yes, it's inherently a race

[10:16] <Altreus> a timeout is literally that :)

[10:17] <lizmat> well, I think at least the example at https://docs.perl6.org/type/Promise#method_in is wrong

[10:17] <lizmat> in the sense that it will *always* run the .kill after 5 seconds

[10:18] <lizmat> I guess the timeout code should be something like: unless $promise { note "timeout" ... }

[10:19] <jnthn> Yeah, that's not a good way to write that

[10:19] <scimon> Altreus: I wrote Timer::Breakable for this kind of situation.

[10:19] <jnthn> That's what a react block is for

[10:19] <lizmat> well, I think this example predates react  :-)

[10:22] <Altreus> scimon: oh handy

[10:22] <Altreus> definitely a perl

[10:24] <Altreus> time to take off the rose-tinted glasses and do real work though :(

[10:25] <scimon> And I've just spotted the docs are a bit wrong.... Ooops.

[11:38] <tbrowder_> hi, #perl6

[11:38] <El_Che> hi, dr Nick^Wtbrowser_

[11:42] *** Technato1 joined
[11:43] <tbrowder_> i’m looking at the doc order in the Language section. i like the idea of grouping by categories with topics under them in some order that may not be alphabetical. i can’t promise any progress any time soon, but it would be helpful to have some concensus on grouping titles and their order.

[11:44] <stmuk_> tbrowder_: I'm experimenting with a "quick fix" .. which is to just sort language by filename order again (like you did with the program section)

[11:44] <stmuk_> but ordering in a more explicit way is certainly better

[11:46] *** markoong joined
[11:47] <tbrowder_> ok, good. i suggest using a renaming format something like xyy-name where x is a-z for grouping and yy is 00-99 for subgrouping.

[11:48] *** lizmat joined
[11:48] *** wamba joined
[11:49] <stmuk_> I wondered if the ordering should be done within the pod6 itself somehow rather than the filename

[11:49] <tbrowder_> stmuk: i think that’s not a bad solution (but devil in naming details).

[11:50] <tbrowder_> to create groups we can just add a page with the desired title for each group.

[11:50] <tbrowder_> using the xyy-name scheme.

[11:52] <squashable6> 🍕🍕🍕  First contribution by AlexDaniel++! ♥

[11:52] <tbrowder_> ordering within the pod could be done with more backend work using some agreed-upon id or other key as a config entry on a defined or paragraph block.

[11:54] <tbrowder_> stmuk: for long-term maintenance that is imo the best way to go. maybe the easiest since we already use pod data!

[11:55] <stmuk_> I also think we should aim to make it easier for other HTML front-ends to process the pod6

[13:10] <timotimo> moritz: ^

[13:11] <moritz> it should, yes

[13:11] <yoleaux> 13:00Z <Zoffix> moritz: I wasn't sure what your timetable was, so I deferred the ".DEFINITE @%& params" to 6.e: https://github.com/perl6/6.d-prep/tree/master/deferred-to-6.e#--and-possibly--sigils-only-accept-definite-objects   If you still want them to go into 6.d, now's a good time to implement them :)

[13:11] *** _sjn left
[13:12] <Zoffix> TBH, last night I was thinking about it and while it's true the proposal says people don't expect to accept typeobjects, it's equally true that it's not quite a problem I encountered IRL that a `@foo` parameter would all of a sudden be a type object. So to me, it feels like this is solving a hypothetical edge-case scenario, but it's introducing extra things for the programmer to learn: now a person learning

[13:12] <Zoffix> about `@foo` in parameters has to learn about `:D`/`:U` constraints at the same time

[13:12] *** sjn_ is now known as sjn

[13:13] <Zoffix> And now it's complicated by the fact that we're dropping the constraint conditionally, which invalidates the original purpose of the change.

[13:13] * Zoffix switches to -½ on that change

[13:13] <moritz> Zoffix: we have had people in the chat asking questions that had this as root cause

[13:13] <Zoffix> And if we're conditionally dropping that contraint from `@foo`, why aren't we dropping it from `Int:D $foo`?

[13:13] <moritz> so it's not theoretical

[13:14] <Zoffix> moritz: how did they end up with a typeobject in those parameters?

[13:15] <moritz> Zoffix: my memories are fuzzy, but I think they did something like foo(bar()), and bar accidentally returned a type object

[13:16] <Zoffix> I think it's easy to come up with all sorts of crazy special behaviour that may look easy for us to remember because we already know most of the language, but from the perspective of programmers coming to the language or programmers who use it infrequently we're weaving a complicated web of special cases and behaviours. There's already a language that does that: Perl 5.

[13:35] <Altreus> The only thing it's not given me out of the box so far is being able to abort a Promise.in

[13:35] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: Incomplete because it gives only one value or broken because it silently picks an arbitrary value from a set of available ones

[13:35] <Zoffix> heh

[13:35] <Zoffix> "probably" :)

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> :) I personally have seen no tests for it

[13:36] <timotimo> i hope it relies on hash order :P

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> but maybe it is tested, I don't know

[13:36] *** Zoffix left
[13:39] <AlexDaniel> but I don't think it's incomplete

[13:39] <timotimo> i would not expect MyEnum(1) to give me anything but an instance of MyEnum

[13:39] <timotimo> i.e. not a list

[13:39] <AlexDaniel> you said “give me enum entry that has value 0” and it answered “here you go: c”

[13:40] *** Zoffix joined
[13:40] <timotimo> perhaps if you have debug output, like you get something returned from a C library and you want to output what enum values it corresponds to but you don't know the "context"

[13:40] <Zoffix> Just realized why Array[42] gives Any: it's needed for autovivification magic

[13:40] *** Zoffix left
[13:40] <timotimo> yup

[13:41] <timotimo> well, the scalar is what's responsible, not the Any itself

[13:41] <timotimo> but that's the reason it doesn't, for example, throw an exception

[13:41] <timotimo> except if you have a shaped array, in that case autoviv doesn't exist

[13:42] <raschipi> That's why I was confused. I just saw normal autovivification and thought: what is he on about?

[13:42] <timotimo> i must have missed where he was first confused about that

[13:42] <timotimo> ah, there it is

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: well, we can make it return any() junction, and then bring popcorn to see the world burn and people scream in pain :D

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> at least no one will argue that it is “incomplete” :D

[15:43] <Zoffix> Wonder if promoting Perl 6 counts as "commercial use"

[15:48] <Juerd> It shouldn't

[15:52] <Zoffix> No? :) OK

[15:52] * Zoffix limbos under the legal bar

[15:52] *** sena_kun joined
[15:53] <Juerd> Perl 6 itself is not a for-profit or commercial project

[15:53] <Juerd> And that it may also be used for profit or commercial projects, is not relevant

[15:56] <Zoffix> What about TPF grants? That don't count? Like if someone is doing a grant and is promoting P6 and is benefitting directly from it?

[15:57] <Juerd> TPF is a non-profit organisation

[15:57] <Juerd> Getting paid for something doesn't necessarily make that something a commercial endeavour 

[15:58] <Juerd> It's normal for non-profit organisations to have paid employees and to pay external workers

[15:59] <mst> Zoffix: this sounds like you have some sort of specific worry

[16:05] <Zoffix> Ah, OK.

[16:06] <Zoffix> mst: yeah, I'm making some Diwali flyers and this sexy font is not allowed for commercial use :) https://www.dafont.com/pw-curvy-regular-script.font

[16:07] <mst> I would imagine that, provided you're not charging for the result, you're fine

[16:07] <Zoffix> cool

[16:07] <mst> well and also not promoting a for-profit company

[16:07] <mst> but promoting perl6 doesn't suffer from either of those

[16:19] <El_Che> in .be real grants are exempt from taxes

[16:19] <Zoffix> in .ca I had to give ~33% of mine to gov

[16:19] *** psychoslave left
[16:20] <El_Che> as there is a difference between a grant and employement

[16:20] <El_Che> the ltter being commercial even if the organisation is a non-profit

[16:20] <El_Che> Zoffix: as expected, not everyone can give grants around here

[16:20] <El_Che> mostly academic and scientific organisations

[16:21] <El_Che> (universities's grant is just employment which grants you taxes, but also social protection)

[16:23] <El_Che> heat and trains is a bad combination (waiting in a broken train to me moved from the tracks)

[18:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar ade83c861: OUTPUT: «oc ea n »

[18:34] <uzl> Is using a default positional argument in a pointy block the right way to account for a word with an odd letter count in the previous example?

[18:34] <moritz> uzl: I'd say it's one valid way

[18:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar ade83c861: OUTPUT: «oc ea n »

[18:35] <perlpilot> uzl: for what you were doing, probably.  Typically, it looks something like this:  for 'ocean'.comb -> $l1, $l2? { ... } but then you get an uninit value

[18:35] *** Kaiepi joined
[18:36] <perlpilot> uzl: When I said "typically", I wasn't being specific to .comb  :-)

[18:37] <uzl> moritz: yes, one valid way ;)

[18:38] <uzl> perlpilot: it's a simplified version of this: https://github.com/LaurentRosenfeld/thinkperl6/blob/56301edb538ee294b5cdabf5104b3030d17b40f6/book/appendix_solutions.tex#L3857-L3860

[18:39] <uzl> it seems to throw an error when it finds an odd-numbered word.

[18:41] <perlpilot> yeah, because you get an uninitialized value in the mix

[18:42] <perlpilot> my gut reaction to that would be to use classify, but tmtowtdi  :)

[18:43] <perlpilot> or maybe for $word.comb -> $even, $odd? { push @evens with $even; push @odds, $odd with $odd; }

[18:49] <AlexDaniel> (available since rakudo 2017.02 it seems)

[18:49] <uzl> I'll probably go with the most obvious, albeit less elegant way. the positional parameter defaulted to an empty string.

[18:50] <AlexDaniel> uzl: depending on how large your data is, you might also want to measure performance of different solutions

[18:50] <uzl> But this is awesome! So many ways to approach the same problem! :)

[18:50] <perlpilot> uzl: programming isn't about elegance, it's about getting stuff done  ;)

[18:52] <uzl> I was about to submit a pull request to the book's Github repo. Probably will just point the author to this thread.

[18:55] <perlpilot> uzl: so you've been using "Think Perl 6" for learning?  What do you think of it?

[19:00] <uzl> perlpilot: It's been great. Even though Perl 6 is an extensive language, Laurent covers a lot ground with that book. Certainly useful for complete beginners

[19:00] *** natrys joined
[19:00] <uzl> to computer science, programming and Perl 6.

[19:01] <perlpilot> I haven't really looked at the book extensively, but that's the impression I got from speed reading a few sections.  So, I pointed my 12 year old son at it for learning.  He hasn't gotten very far, but I think he's doing okay.

[19:02] *** Zoffix left
[19:05] <uzl> perlpilot: It's a great book. He should learn a few things if he commits to it and do the exercises. The solutions in the back are really detailed so it's worth look into them.

[19:05] *** telex joined
[19:09] <uzl> perlpilot: There have been few commits to the repo with few fixes and corrections after the book was published. Probably worth looking into the commit history to spot the errors in the physical copy if that's what he's using.
