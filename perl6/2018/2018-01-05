[14:03] <Nanjizal> Good afternoon

[14:06] <Nanjizal> I was wondering how Perl6 compares in features to what I like at the moment Haxe

[14:07] <moritz> Nanjizal: hi. I Don't know Haxe, but if you ask questions about specific features, I can probably tell you if Perl 6 has them

[14:08] *** geekosaur left
[14:09] <Nanjizal> There are some features spec'd here  https://haxe.org/manual/introduction.html, it's a typed language.

[14:13] *** geekosaur joined
[14:13] * perlpilot wonders if masak looked at Haxe's macros for any nuggets of information.

[14:14] <moritz> Nanjizal: which one are you curious about?

[14:15] *** bart_ joined
[14:16] <jnthn> Perl 6 is gradually typed. Generally, there's more safety than in most other dynamic languages on things that are lexically scoped (so, you find out about typo'd variables and sub call names at compile time); OO is fully late-bound.

[14:17] *** bart_ is now known as brrt

[14:20] <Nanjizal> Ok I learnt flash is my late 30's so I probably don't know all the computer engineering names.  Could I create say a tetris clone easily in Perl6 and run it in the browser and could I also use it with say some shaders

[14:21] <Nanjizal> I find if I can do graphics with a language then it's more interesting to learn.

[14:21] <Nanjizal> for me

[14:22] <perlpilot> someone did write a version of tetris on one of the earlier PerlÂ 6 implementations: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/tetris-on-niecza/

[14:22] <perlpilot> I bet it could be updated for modern Rakudo without too much troubl

[14:22] <perlpilot> er trouble

[14:22] *** cdg joined
[14:23] *** geekosaur left
[14:24] <perlpilot> looking at the source, it seems that all of the graphics interface would need to be rethought and redone, but not too terribly bad

[14:25] <Nanjizal> This was the experiment I did in haxe it was kind of for job interview but did not get it :(  https://github.com/nanjizal/PolyominoTriangles   It's kind of more complex than normal tetris.  

[14:25] <Nanjizal> So you don't normally use multiple files for code?

[14:26] <perlpilot> when needed, sure.

[14:26] <mspo> you had to write tetris for a job interview?

[14:26] <mspo> that seems a little extreme :)

[14:26] <mspo> (or maybe not, idk)

[14:27] <Nanjizal> Think I took too long.

[14:27] *** geekosaur joined
[14:27] *** geekosaur left
[14:27] <Nanjizal> And did not use mvc stuff and unit Testing 

[14:28] <perlpilot> well, if they asked you "do this simple thing" and you made it way more complicated and didn't quite finish ....  them maybe this task accomplished what they were after.

[14:29] <perlpilot> Nanjizal: This was like a "take home" assignment?  (i.e. here's the problem we want you to solve, you have N time-units)

[14:29] <perlpilot> where the time-units were probably days?

[14:30] *** geekosaur joined
[14:31] <Nanjizal> yer I had a week, my solution works with all the graphics toolkits and is more analog tetris and more configurable but took two weeks. 

[14:34] <Nanjizal> Ah the Rubic Cube example I should look at from that guys blog to get a feel for Perl6

[14:34] *** darutoko- left
[14:35] *** domidumont joined
[14:35] <Nanjizal> or maybe not!

[14:35] *** darutoko joined

[14:36] <perlpilot> I once knew a guy who was told "write a simple rolodex web-app.  Nothing fancy, just record people's names, addresses, phone numbers, and have the ability to search by name.  No fancy interface, just plain HTML to add entries and search for them."   when he called me, he was 10 hours into the project and hadn't gotten anything close to working.  He was suffering from Analysis Paralysis.  Unfortunately, this was for a job he already had and because he 

[14:36] <perlpilot> was taking so long, they let him go.

[14:42] <Nanjizal> I have got large flash AIR projects shipped, but due to bad management and excessive opensource restrictions after taken over by plc quit after 3 years.  But being expert it flash is not needed these days so unsure what direction to take.

[14:44] <moritz> the question is really: what do you want to do?

[14:44] <moritz> web development? application development? backend? devops? project management? agile methodologies? ...

[14:45] *** geekosaur joined
[14:45] <Nanjizal> Well I was not overly excited by React when i looked at it.  I like visual stuff.

[14:46] <moritz> there is lots of web development that isn't react

[14:46] <mspo> perlpilot: interview for your own job?

[14:47] <mspo> brutal

[14:47] <perlpilot> mspo: my last job interview was something like "implement an API for a tic-tac-toe game"

[14:48] <mspo> perlpilot: that doesn't seem too bad

[14:48] <perlpilot> it wasn't  :-)

[14:48] <mspo> whiteboard-able, I'd say

[14:48] <mspo> I mean the design and pseudo-ish code parts

[14:48] <perlpilot> well, they wanted me to use a few specific PerlÂ 5 technologies

[14:49] <perlpilot> so, yeah, they wanted to see some real working code

[14:49] <mspo> mojolicious::lite :)

[14:49] <perlpilot> that technology was not on the list

[14:49] <perlpilot> I think they just wanted me to use Dancer and Moo(se)

[14:49] <mspo> put /move/game/*/coords/*

[14:49] <mspo> or whatever

[15:03] <timotimo> i'd like to get a little bit of support for a linux/hard drive question: https://gist.github.com/timo/e766094726dd167849bc9d2b1d567efa - should i be worried about this disk?

[15:04] <moritz> good question. Do you have SMART data for it?

[15:05] *** jkramer joined
[15:05] <moritz> or whatever that disk self-reporting protocol is called

[15:05] <jkramer> Ahoy

[15:06] <scimon> My Perl6 Library grows a little bit with todays arrival.

[15:06] *** domidumont joined
[15:06] <gfldex> timotimo: that's bad sectors. Most large disks will get a few of those. If it persists after overwriting those sectors replace the disk.

[15:07] <scimon> Hopefully now I can get my head around Grammars. :) moritz++

[15:07] <timotimo> i just bought this disk two days ago

[15:07] <gfldex> timotimo: did you run `badblocks` on it?

[15:07] <timotimo> i did not

[15:07] *** domidumont left
[15:07] *** domidumont joined
[15:08] <gfldex> you should do that with any (non-SSD) drive before using it

[15:08] <moritz> scimon: when read it, I'd appreciate feedback

[15:08] <moritz> *you

[15:08] <gfldex> SSDs will compress and dedup, so you need bigger tools to test those

[15:08] *** comborico1611 joined
[15:10] <gfldex> timotimo: if the disk is just installed, it might be a cabeling issue too. `smartctl -x /dev/sdf` can tell the difference

[15:12] *** domidumont left
[15:12] <scimon> Will do :)

[15:13] <moritz> https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/ says "#1 New Release in Perl Programming", and has been since November at least \o/

[15:14] <moritz> the actual selling ranks aren't as great though :(

[15:16] <timotimo> gfldex: not sure what exactly to look at there

[15:16] <timotimo> gfldex: if i want to "badblocks" a hard drive that's currently in use, i.e. copying data onto it, do i have to do something special?

[15:17] <timotimo> also, if i already ran it for a few seconds before i decided it'd be better to read the man page first, did it destroy any data?

[15:17] <moritz> and why oh why is the kindle version more expensive than print? https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484228987

[15:18] <timotimo> also, if that was just a bad block, why did zfs call it an unrecoverable error?

[15:18] <scimon> These things are meant to try us. Don't know why but I prefer print for coding books.

[15:19] <scimon> I guess the diagrams and code exmaples don't always translate to ebook well.

[15:23] <comborico1611> Print for every book.

[15:23] <comborico1611> The complier complained that I didn't put a braces around return: else { return; }.  Is that normal?

[15:29] <gfldex> timotimo: as you are talking about sdf, I assume there is sd[aâ¦e]. I found that one can't trust a bunch of sata cables. Spending some monay there can save you a great deal of time.

[15:29] <timotimo> interesting

[15:29] <timotimo> three of the cables i just bought recently

[15:30] <timotimo> i'm transfering data over from a fileserver and i took the disks from there and put them into my computer (because this cpu has AES-NI, whereas the other one does not)

[15:30] *** stmuk_ joined
[15:31] <DrForr> comborico1611: Yeah, Perl still doesn't let you do C-style 'return', sorry, you need braces.

[15:31] <jkramer> How do I initialize attributes in a BUILD submethod when BUILD has arguments of the same name?

[15:31] <scimon> So with new book, Tau Station and project Euler (Having so much fun writing really small solutions to things).... I probably should be doing some work.

[15:32] <jkramer> I.e. submethod BUILD(:$foo) { self.foo = $foo } or whatever

[15:32] <jnthn> submethod BUILD(:$!foo) { }

[15:32] <scimon> What he said.

[15:33] <jkramer> Ah thanks, that works

[15:33] <scimon> https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects#Object_Construction best thing to look at. (If you want build to do other things).

[15:34] <comborico1611> DrForr, thank you. 

[15:34] <perlpilot> comborico1611: or use a ternary

[15:37] *** webstrand joined
[15:38] <Nanjizal> I was wondering does Perl6 have VSC, something like Kode where perl6 compile maybe embedded in the editor?

[15:38] <Nanjizal> ( eg: https://github.com/Kode/KodeStudio ).  Is Atom the best editor to use at moment?

[15:38] <comborico1611> It's alright.  I actually do prefer the braces. 

[15:38] <comborico1611> Thanks, though!

[15:39] <timotimo> gfldex: btw, i'm worried that perhaps my computer's PSU might not be sufficient to handle all 6 + 2 disks; how do i tell if the PSU is at its limit, and how do i tell if a problem comes from power?

[15:40] *** rindolf joined
[15:40] <Nanjizal> Kode is kind of Visual Studio Code with haxe and kha within so you can do single download for editor language and toolkit. It's really nice for starters.

[15:40] <gfldex> timotimo: if you system is fine when the disk spin up all at the same time, it wont be a problem

[15:40] <Nanjizal> So thought I would mention in case you had similar approach for perl6

[15:40] <timotimo> thanks

[15:41] <comborico1611> Man, I'm just loving the KDE environment.  

[15:42] <timotimo> comborico1611: sarcasm or really?

[15:42] <DrForr> Nanjizal: Sounds cool. Got a URL?

[15:42] <comborico1611> Heh.  Really.

[15:42] <Nanjizal> https://github.com/Kode/KodeStudio/releases

[15:44] <Nanjizal> I mean if you can do that with Perl6 that would be nice for people like me curious, at the moment on a mac I downloaded something I put it my app folder but it is just a folder it's kind of not clear the next step

[15:45] <DrForr> Looks like you'd have to file a bug or make a PR.

[15:48] <Nanjizal> What is the textmate support for perl6 like I seem to have perl.tmbundle installed

[15:49] <timotimo> comborico1611: i'm unhappy with my plasma setup, but it can very well be user error

[15:49] <DrForr> I don't use TextMate, couldn't say.

[15:51] <DrForr> As you say there's a perl6 textmate bundle file, no idea what it does.

[15:54] <timotimo> we do have plugins for atom, i'd expect they also come with a "run my code" and/or "run my test suite" buttons built-in

[15:56] <DrForr> With tmux they're only ^Bn!! away.

[15:57] <timotimo> :)

[16:02] <DrForr> Not that I dislike GUI editors, I just find they're too helpful.

[16:02] *** dogbert17 joined
[16:03] * DrForr goes back to conference-driven development.

[16:04] <Nanjizal> Well from experiance of trying Haxe with lots and lots of editors I like textmate because it's simple but has no completion etc... cross platform Visual Studio Code seems to be the best for people customising and for general use, I think Visual Studio Code is based on Atom.  It's far from perfect but VSC seems quite nice I saw on google there is some stuff but not idea if it's robust?  There...

[16:04] <Nanjizal> ...is a big difference between a nice code text editor and full on IDE eclipse thing.  I think something between eclipse and vim is my preference.

[16:06] <DrForr> I have Atom installed, I just haven't found a pressing need for it. I keep thinking if I just force myself ot use it in preference to Vim I'll get the itch to fix the plugin menus and such, but I eventually throw up my preoverbial hands and go back to vim.

[16:07] <Nanjizal> As I said Kode actually has the Haxe compiler embedded in the app, and the Kha framework so like now I am trying to work out how to setup atom for perl6 and its effort.  Vim is keystroke I have devorak keyboard layout and no patients to learn vim.

[16:08] <DrForr> A few core perl6 developers use Atom, so it should get some love. Don't know how it's going though.

[16:09] * El_Che would love Perl6 support for IntelliJ

[16:09] <DrForr> If nothing else put your atom config into Git and when you find things, commit and push.

[16:09] <comborico1611> I like emacs.

[16:09] <MasterDuke> huggable: ide

[16:09] <huggable> MasterDuke, nothing found

[16:09] <Nanjizal> I guess the view point is allow people to create with a language with the least setup friction, you only to look at stuff like node to realize that.  I would not touch the InteliJ stuff for haxe if you paid me but I do know some large games companies etc... that use it like Tivo

[16:09] <MasterDuke> huggable: atom

[16:09] <huggable> MasterDuke, nothing found

[16:10] <El_Che> atom is painfull compared to intellij

[16:10] <El_Che> use a proper ide (intellij and the like) or vim

[16:10] <El_Che> atom uses a sad space in between

[16:10] <DrForr> Nanjizal: So where are the friction points you find with Atom and perl6?

[16:11] <mspo> :)

[16:11] <Nanjizal> DrForr download Kode and try some Kha.

[16:11] <mspo> El_Che: people seem to like it

[16:11] <MasterDuke> well, this is what i was trying to find. https://github.com/perl6/Atom-as-a-Perl6-IDE

[16:12] <El_Che> mspo: for perl6? Sure, there insn't much out there

[16:12] <Nanjizal> https://github.com/Kode/Kha/wiki/Getting-Started

[16:12] <DrForr> (he says, waiting for Atom to spool up...)

[16:12] <mspo> El_Che: I mean Atom in general

[16:12] <mspo> El_Che: although I think VSCode is nicer (in that space)

[16:12] <El_Che> mspo: a desktop in JS, geniousÃ§

[16:12] <DrForr> Nanjizal: That sounds like not so much pain points as nobody getting around to configure it.

[16:12] <El_Che> except when it supposed to be fast

[16:12] <El_Che> :)

[16:13] <DrForr> Huh, haven't touched it in a while and it already throws a configuration error at me.

[16:14] <Nanjizal> DrForr I can just drag a kha project into Kode debug twice and it's running.

[16:14] <mspo> I should try switching to emacs again

[16:14] <mspo> hard to stop using vim

[16:15] <DrForr> Great, then figure out where Kha reads its configuration file, add the '.pm6' => 'perl6' bit or whatever is needed, ake a pull request and you're off and running.

[16:15] <eiro> mspo, why switching to emacs ?

[16:15] <mspo> eiro: I tried looking at vimscript and my head exploded

[16:16] <eiro> i mean: sure it's probably much powerfull but i really think it's not that consise to script and use

[16:16] <DrForr> Nanjizal: Also, if you're hoping that someone else will write this for you, then maybe you can dig around for fellow Kha users and see if they have any ideas.

[16:16] <eiro> * there is an embedded perl 

[16:16] <mspo> eiro: I'd have to use evil mode regardless; I genuinely like modal editing

[16:17] <mspo> cool kids use emacs :)

[16:17] <eiro> * the async of vim8 changes the why extensions will be developped 

[16:17] <eiro> really ? :) well ... i'm too old for those things :)

[16:18] <eiro> i'm stuck to vim just because i got old 

[16:18] * DrForr grabs the community IntelliJ edition out of curiosity.

[16:18] <comborico1611> I prefer emacs because they help the beginner.

[16:18] <Nanjizal> NOOOOOOO!!!

[16:18] <comborico1611> At least in the program itself.  It's always nice when things are self-contained.

[16:18] <eiro> DrForr, there is an awesome vim mode extension... i was really surprised how good it was 

[16:18] <eiro> but ... wait ...

[16:19] <mspo> eiro: I don't even like ALE (async-version of Syntastic)

[16:19] * El_Che is a cheapass and had a legal licensed version for free :)

[16:19] <moritz> let's start an editor flame war right now!

[16:19] <Nanjizal> IntelliJ is eclipse based so if you want to set it up to compile something for two setups good luck!!!

[16:19] <El_Che> Nanjizal: you're are talking nonsense

[16:19] <eiro> wait for the splashsceen to appears, the features to start 

[16:19] <eiro> event completion is slow 

[16:19] <mspo> eclipse didn't have functional maven support the last time I used it

[16:19] <mspo> EclipseOS

[16:20] <eiro> mspo, so it's time to switch to ... builder :) 

[16:20] <eiro> gnome-builder seems to be very cool

[16:20] <mspo> eiro: I also don't particularly like the completion UI that most editors use

[16:20] <eiro> especially the gnome debug integration 

[16:20] <DrForr> And now at the launch of the editor wars you see the *real* reason I don't play in this arena :)

[16:20] <mspo> eiro: I'd prefer a fixed size screen on the bottom or something

[16:21] <eiro> :)

[16:21] <mspo> eiro: in vim does that go int othe quickfix or the location list window?

[16:21] <eiro> i have to admit i still use vim from a terminal and it's ok for me. especially because i started to use and abuse the ! operator since i tested plan9

[16:22] <mspo> eiro: are the builtin fd plugins overriding the 3rd part ones or..?

[16:22] <mspo> yes I also just use terminal

[16:22] <eiro> reading the question again ... sorry

[16:22] <mspo> native gui don't interest me

[16:22] <Nanjizal> https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/intellij-haxe/issues     - 175 issues, I will not touch Intellij for any language that is not in the top 5.

[16:22] <mspo> so younger people just view the browser as I view the terminal

[16:22] <eiro> mspo, sorry i don't get your question 

[16:23] <mspo> eiro: doesn't matter :)

[16:23] <eiro> about quickfix window

[16:23] <Nanjizal> I am not talking rubish Intellij is just too hard to configure for a language.  I saw how fast VSC was setup and became useful in Haxe community.

[16:23] <El_Che> Perl 5 support is pretty good (third party)

[16:24] <El_Che> builin java and go support in in the enterprise version are top

[16:24] <eiro> mspo, please try again once please "that go int othe " doesn't make sense for me 

[16:24] *** jkramer left
[16:24] <mspo> eiro: the quickfix and location list windows are, basically, the same thing

[16:24] <mspo> eiro: so if I wanted to get completions drawing into one of those, which would I use and how would I do it?

[16:25] <mspo> eiro: my point is that vim is confusing :)

[16:25] <eiro> oohhh ... i use an empty buffer for this

[16:26] <eiro> with a fuzzysearch

You can't tell me that Intellij is as simple? Sure it's not so simple from Kode to make android app but once you have your app you can rebuild that with simple command from terminal after installing haxe.

[16:38] <Nanjizal> is there a simple run through on getting the hello world to run from 'atom'.

[17:11] <Ulti> afaik Im doing mostly what's shown in the docs there

[17:11] <Nanjizal> on a mac- download put into application directory and brew installed so probably have two copies.  I am in atom and I am not sure how to get the folder with a p6 file to run.  The end to end starting process for a new user is not really going to sell perl6 over something like nodejs, at moment perl6 start pages assume a perl or sys admin with interest in perl, rather than any old developer....

[17:11] <Nanjizal> ...Perl6 has to assume that many developers have a huge number of languages they could start using and if they can't easily try it out then they will probably move on to some corporate sponsored language, before even finding out how useful the language is.  I am not intending to be negative just frank.

[17:12] <Ulti> with Atom there's a single package to install to get it to do a lot of nice Perl 6 things

[17:13] <Nanjizal> You assuming i know Atom?

[17:13] <Nanjizal> I have managed to install the package despite any screenshots 

[17:13] <Ulti> Im assuming if you've chosen Atom you know how to find the install modules section and type in "perl6"

[19:53] <geekosaur> it's not running a gui so it doesn;t have the same order of memory leaks etc,

[19:54] * geekosaur has a vps running nothing but a dedicated znc. why would it get slow?

[19:55] <[Coke]> 19:49 < comborico> There it goes.  Timeout.  Hmm.

[19:55] <[Coke]> 19:49 < comborico> That makes sense.

[19:55] <[Coke]> (oops, accidental cut and paste)

[19:56] <geekosaur> as for slow disconnect, it indeed depends on the network. you don't want the server to assume any momentary network blip is a hard disconnect, so it waits a bit before declaring the connection dead.

[21:57] <comborico1611> Heh.  Thanks!

[21:58] <comborico1611> I formatted a partition and installed a new OS, and Xchat knew my username when I installed it . . .

[21:58] <comborico1611> It must be keeping track of my IP or something.

[21:59] <El_Che> it's gets it from your unix username?

[21:59] <comborico1611> OHHH

[21:59] <timotimo> usually that, yeah

[21:59] <comborico1611> Thanks, dude.

[21:59] <El_Che> or the NSA is after you

[21:59] <comborico1611> You're right.  It is.

[21:59] <comborico1611> Okay, another question.

[22:00] <El_Che> the Russians

[22:00] <comborico1611> What is the command-line in Bash for turning on a drive.

[22:00] <comborico1611> Like you know when you use a File Manager, you see the drive, but it isn't "mounted?" yet

[22:00] <El_Che> mount

[22:01] <El_Che> on the file manager you can mount the drive by clicking on it

[22:01] <timotimo> lsblk is a nice tool to see what's available

[22:01] <comborico1611> What is the option you give to "mount" ?

[22:01] <comborico1611> sudo mount /media BLANK

[22:02] <El_Che> timotimo++: I have dmesg stuck in my fingers, but your way is better

[22:02] <timotimo> you need the device node that represents the disk or partition you want

[22:02] <timotimo> i like /dev/disk/by-id/ for that

[22:02] <El_Che> e.g. sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

[22:02] <timotimo> but often it's enough to just use /dev/sda through /dev/sdz and then the partition number after that

[22:02] <timotimo> like /dev/sdb3

[22:03] <comborico1611> Okay.  Thanks, guys!
