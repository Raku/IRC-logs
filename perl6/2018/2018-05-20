[00:45] <wolfshield> hi, i'm trying and failing to get DBIish working in the official latest rakudo star docker

[00:46] <wolfshield> keep getting DBIish: DBDish::mysql needs 'mysqlclient', not found

[00:48] <wolfshield> have tried advice from googling, installing default-libmysqlclient-dev, without success

[00:54] <MasterDuke> wolfshield: what os? i think i saw some issue recently with libmysql vs libmariadb

[00:55] <wolfshield> it is debian 9 

[00:56] <MasterDuke> have you seen https://github.com/perl6/DBIish/issues/99 ?

[00:59] <wolfshield> yes, but apt-get install libmysqlclient20 did't find anything, and installing the mariadb-compat didn't help

[01:00] <wolfshield> i think i just found the ticket -- creating the right symlink in debian 9, as per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50175106/installation-requirements-for-mysql-with-dbiish-on-rakudo-star-docker-image

[01:00] <MasterDuke> good. i don't use DBIish myself, so you'd reached the end of any help i could give

[01:01] <wolfshield> do you talk to dbs with perl6?

[01:02] <MasterDuke> nope. my perl6 is all for fun, and that hasn't involved dbs yet

[01:02] <wolfshield> gotcha, thanks.

[01:03] <MasterDuke> (i do enjoy dbs, and used to use DBI in perl5 for $work years ago, just hasn't come up in perl6 yet)

[09:44] <pmurias> I'm mostly asking about this because it rounds to zero in JavaScripts new BigInt implementation and I have to explicitly implement the round down

[10:12] <pmurias> a quote from the JavaScript BigInt proposal

[10:12] <pmurias> Guido has wrote a blog post why Python rounds down

[10:19] <jmerelo> pmurias: http://python-history.blogspot.com.es/2010/08/why-pythons-integer-division-floors.html

[10:19] <jmerelo> pmurias: it has some vague references to Python arithmetic

[10:20] <jmerelo> pmurias: but the argument he uses about dates before 1970 is patently false. You divide a negative epoch by number of seconds, you'll round the number of days up, not down.

[14:13] <MasterDuke> i don't have any particular interest in using rust, and there are lots of jokes to be made about the rust evangelism squad, but it does seem like a pretty decent language for what it's targeting

[14:15] <pmurias> El_Che: what I mean MoarVM-in-rust would be basically more with different tradeoffs for development, when there are other Perl 6 backends I (and others) could spend time on

[14:17] <pmurias> El_Che: the js backends will be able to put Perl 6 in some new interesting places, a GraalVM potentially overs very likely super good performance and easy interop with JVM-stuff and other dynamic languages

[14:18] <El_Che> yes

[14:18] <El_Che> rust made sense as in replacing the C backend, not in addition

[14:18] <MasterDuke> pmurias: speaking of GraalVM, do you have any particular plans for it?

[14:19] <El_Che> things like JS provides advantages as it's an other platform

[14:23] <pmurias> MasterDuke: I plan to explore it some more, and see if/how I can get people exited enough to help

[14:24] <pmurias> MasterDuke: not sure how I'll split efforts towards it and the js one (but working on it when I'm stuck on the js one instead of just getting discouraged towards everythings seems like one strategy)

[14:28] <MasterDuke> pmurias: cool. are there any clean next steps?

[14:33] <pmurias> MasterDuke: getting sub calls working is the next big step, a low hanging one would be adding the simple ops, like: nqp::print, nqp::add_i etc.

[14:34] <pmurias> MasterDuke: the most important step would be figuring a strategy how to have the effort be easy/fun to get involved with

[14:36] <MasterDuke> i kind of hate to say this because documentation usually isn't that fun, but is anything written up about how to start contributing? e.g., software/environment prerequisites

[14:39] <pmurias> MasterDuke: not yet, but I feel too that's what's I should start working on

[17:19] <tbrowder_> actually, i don‚Äôt see where ‚Äú#‚Äù followed by a back-tic is documented as a legal declarator block, but i need to check S26, roast, and the grammar.

[17:21] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: you are probably right. But I seem to remember there's some issue with the backtick, maybe not specced.

[17:22] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: besides that, what else would be missing? 

[17:22] <tbrowder_> i‚Äôll fiddle with that problem...

[17:23] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: there's something here https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/c442265897690d299f1f3afd30ba4f8b69955ce5/doc/Language/syntax.pod6

[17:24] <tbrowder_> i don‚Äôt know of anything else, but i‚Äôll dig a bit deeper, first into Damian‚Äôs mind, i.e., S26

[17:24] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: Damian's mind... there be dragons...

[17:24] <tbrowder_> yepper!

[17:24] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: I'll add references to the embedded comments. They are all over the place, but where they belong. I'll reopen the issue 

[17:25] <tbrowder_> cool

[17:32] <tbrowder_> so far, in roast, i‚Äôve only found ‚Äú#|‚Äù and ‚Äú#=‚Äú (but no grep yet)

[17:33] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: it's used all over the place in the docs: git grep '#`'

[17:34] <tbrowder_> yep, but is it correct...checking S26 now...

[17:39] <tbrowder_> i see NO reference in S26 to any valid declarator block start other than ‚Äú#|‚Äù (leading) and ‚Äú#=‚Äú (trailing).  in fact, ‚Äú#=‚Äú may be speccd wrong since S26 says it refers to the line immediately before it.

[17:50] <lucasb> what? #`(...) is an embedded comment, right? not a POD thing

[17:50] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: there goes the documentation.

[17:50] <jmerelo> lucasb: POD are just fancy comments.

[17:52] <tbrowder_> lucasb: does embedded mean something like Z<>?

[17:52] <jmerelo> lucasb: anyway,#`[] is now commented in syntax and in pod. This one is a bit better. You want to move it around, feel free.

[17:52] <lucasb> tbrowder_: it means something like standard C comment: CODE /*...*/ CODE

[17:52] <tbrowder_> thnx

[17:52] <lucasb> say #`(hi) 42

[17:52] <evalable6> lucasb, rakudo-moar f98ea64de: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[17:53] <tbrowder_> ah!

[17:55] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: that was the issue I linked from your issue, which was closed with this text https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Multi-line_/_embedded_comments

[17:56] *** shareable6 left
[17:57] <tbrowder_> now i see...so we still need an example of the multi-line pod declarator block, correct?

[17:58] *** shareable6 joined
[17:59] <tbrowder_> and maybe some words per lucasb  on the diff between embedded comment and pod declarator block

[17:59] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: using #|, you mean?

[18:00] <tbrowder_> yes, that and ‚Äú#=‚Äú

[18:03] <tbrowder_> note that ‚ÄúZ<>‚Äù is the embedded comment INSIDE

[18:04] <tbrowder_> inside pod while ‚Äú#backtick‚Äù is an embedded comment inside code‚Äîboth should result in a zero space during p6 parsing

[18:08] <tbrowder_> thanks, jmerelo, i‚Äôm not very energetic today so i appreciate you

[18:09] <tbrowder_> i think you‚Äôve earned your grant!

[18:10] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: by the way, what's the right link to your May report?

[18:10] <AlexDaniel> or whatever month that was‚Ä¶

[18:12] <AlexDaniel> there was a blog post on blogs.perl6.org I think but the link was broken

[18:12] <AlexDaniel> ah, April that was

[18:12] <AlexDaniel> http://news.perlfoundation.org/2018/05/grant-report-improving-perl-6-.html

[18:13] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right, it's linked to StackOverflow :-) That might explain a lot...

[18:14] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: it's right here https://jj.github.io/TPF-Grant/

[18:14] <jmerelo> The rest of the stuff I'm doing can be found more directly in the repo

[18:14] <jmerelo> tbrowder_: thanks, I really appreciate that.

[18:16] *** lizmat left
[18:17] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I'd say main contributions are not very documented in that report

[18:17] <tbrowder_> AlexDaniel: do i remember correctly that we can move bugs from rt.perl to github issues, at least in some cases?

[18:18] <AlexDaniel> graphs are cool but even ‚ÄúOther contributions‚Äù section is more valuable for me as a reader

[18:18] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: usually that happens when a duplicate is created on github (we then close RT ticket and leave GH ticket open)

[18:18] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder_: if you want to move some specific ticket, feel free to

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> but generally, yes, github is the main tracker now

[18:19] <AlexDaniel> but we're not forcefully moving any tickets

[18:20] <tbrowder_> ok, i‚Äôm thinking of moving some major pod issues (major to me, at least) from rt to github.

[18:21] <AlexDaniel> if that would make life easier to you, feel free to do it

[18:21] <tbrowder_> thnx

[18:22] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: should I move it upwards maybe?

[18:22] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I was thinkig about a section like ‚Äúmost notable documentation tickets resolved‚Äù

[18:22] <AlexDaniel> or something like that

[18:23] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Can you please issue that on the repo? I'll do my best. Also for next month (which is not so far away)

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: which repo? doc repo?

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> ah

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> found the repo

[22:37] <TEttinger> I like Iosevka, which also handles LGC and some unusual parts of unicode but I don't think it covers the vietnamese accented vowels or any non-European scripts

[22:37] <Kaiepi> yeah, it's one of my favouriü§î

[22:37] <Kaiepi> nah emoji doesn't show up

[22:37] <Kaiepi> nor in vim

[22:38] <Kaiepi> i have my locale set up for en_us.UTF-8 in my .profile

[22:39] <TEttinger> 73.9 MB TTF in a .7z archive

[22:40] <Kaiepi> nice

[22:40] <Kaiepi> why do people keep using node as if it were python or perl?

[22:40] <Kaiepi> after having to write ipc in node i never want to use that for general scripting again

[22:42] <Kaiepi> there's no equivalent to .lines like in perl¬†6, you have to buffer messages sent yourself

[22:42] <Kaiepi> go and perl make it really easy

[22:42] <benjikun> I don't like javascript-only developers really

[22:42] <Kaiepi> i used to be one

[22:43] <TEttinger> well I don't think there's a TTF generating lib i python or perl

[22:43] <TEttinger> *in

[22:43] <TEttinger> that's probably why they use it...

[22:43] <Kaiepi> can't install sarasa-gothic, missing some dependencies but they're not available on openbsd

[22:43] <TEttinger> releases

[22:44] <benjikun> building a lot of stuff for openbsd is a pain

[22:44] <Kaiepi> oh perfect

[22:44] <Kaiepi> yeah, especially with node-gyp

[22:44] <benjikun> are you on a laptop?

[22:44] <Kaiepi> i have to do CC=egcc CXX=eg++ CPP=ecpp npm install every time i need to install something that uses node-gyp because it keeps trying to use the ancient default version of gcc

[22:45] <Kaiepi> yeah

[22:45] <benjikun> what laptop

[22:45] <Kaiepi> t470p

[22:45] <benjikun> ah

[22:45] <benjikun> I want a newer laptop soon

[22:45] <Kaiepi> thinkpads are pretty great

[22:46] <Kaiepi> i don't like how the newer releases make it such a pain in the ass to replace the keyboard though

[22:46] <Kaiepi> i broke the right arrow key replacing it 

[22:46] <benjikun> I don't much like the newer thinkpads

[22:46] <benjikun> but I love the old models

[22:46] <Kaiepi> i don't mind the newer ones

[22:46] <Kaiepi> except for that prtsc placement

[22:47] <Kaiepi> what were they thinking?

[22:47] <timotimo> oh god yes

[22:47] <timotimo> my cat loves stepping on that exact spot; at least in xfce that causes a hundred thousand screenshot tool windows to show up

[22:47] <Kaiepi> thankfully i have it mapped to nothing

[22:48] <Kaiepi> scrot -d 5 is good enough for me

[22:51] <benjikun> lol

[22:51] <benjikun> my cat(s) like laying on my entire keyboard

[22:52] <Kaiepi> what do you call operators like +, -, /, div, %, %%, etc.?

[22:53] <benjikun> numeric?

[22:54] <benjikun> when they're inbetween two terms, they're infixed

[22:57] <benjikun> Kaiepi: is that not what you were looking for :P

[22:59] *** tharkun left
[22:59] <Kaiepi> it's not?

[22:59] <Summertime> binary operators?

[23:02] <El_Che> Kaiepi: pick something from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)

[23:02] <jnthn> The Perl 6 terms for operators are prefix (like ~$x), infix (like $x ~ $y), and postfix (like $x++)

[23:02] <benjikun> arithmetic/numeric, binary, infix (sometimes)

[23:02] <benjikun> not sure what else

[23:02] <jnthn> In terms of syntactic position, at least.

[23:05] <MasterDuke> is circumfix considered separate?

[23:05] <Summertime> maybe the question is literal? "plus, minus, slash, div, mod, divisible" :p

[23:06] <El_Che> Summertime: maybe the question was rethorical and we need to shut up :P

[23:06] *** wamba left
[23:07] <jnthn> MasterDuke: Circumfixes are kinds of term rather than operator

[23:07] *** cpage left
[23:07] <jnthn> A postcircumfix is a case of postfix

[23:08] <MasterDuke> huh, didn't know they were terms

[23:09] <Kaiepi> when is the =:= useful? doesn't === also work?

[23:09] <Kaiepi> m: my %a = {}; my %b = %a; %a === %b

[23:14] <Kaiepi> is there an equivalent to bitwise not?

[23:15] <Kaiepi> like in node i'd do ~1 to get -2

[23:17] <MasterDuke> Kaiepi: https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#index-entry-Integer_bitwise_negation_operator

[23:18] <Kaiepi> perfect

[23:18] <Kaiepi> thanks

[23:18] <MasterDuke> i don't think there's a section just for bitwise operators, the operators are grouped by precedence

[23:20] <El_Che> I wouldn't be surpised if jmerelo wrote one while you were typing that :)

[23:20] <Kaiepi> i can't find the operator equivalent to XOR

[23:20] <Kaiepi> like 1 ^ 1 === 0

[23:21] <Kaiepi> oh found it

[23:31] <Kaiepi> ffs updating node broke my node install again
