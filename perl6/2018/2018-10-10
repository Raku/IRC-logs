[08:50] <yoleaux> 9 Oct 2018 23:37Z <[Coke]> pmurias: - https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2359 - REPL borked

[08:52] <jast> in small/embedded systems 32bit is probably still quite popular. whether that's an important target is a different question, of course...

[08:52] * timotimo is sitting in front of some assembly code for an 8bit cpu :P

[08:53] <lizmat> that brings back memories:  doing 8080 assembly  :-)

[08:53] <jast> funnest project I've done in recent times is try and match source code to a specific binary build so I could make binary patches

[08:53] <timotimo> this one's 8051 compatible

[08:54] <jast> I did some 6502 assembly back in the day

[08:54] <lizmat> inside a terminal with ~ 800 bytes of RAM to have your program *and* stack in

[08:55] <jast> but does it have a javascript VM?

[08:55] <timotimo> how else are you supposed to cycle hyperlinks through all colors of the rainbow?

[08:57] <jast> well this MVVM framework I'm using needs a DOM implementation, can't just run it on the Fabric of the Internet(tm)

[08:57] <timotimo> run your app on the microchips embedded into the ethernet plugs

[08:58] <timotimo> you know, the ones that control the yellow and green blinking patterns!

[08:58] <timotimo> BBL

[08:59] <jast> yellow and green is hardly enough for getting all colors of the rainbow, as you said

[09:18] <Xliff> Is there a way to convert a function signature (for callbacks) to a constant or a subset?

[09:22] * erana has made a correlation dimension functionality, statistical chaos theory to use in perl6 games

[09:23] *** Kaypie left
[09:26] <Altreus> i don't understand those words but they sound supreme

[09:27] <erana> I'm just implementing a theory for e.g. decision making in perl6 games

[09:27] <erana> which is statistics

[09:28] <erana> It's from a book I'm reading

[09:29] <erana> Eventually I'll need an integral/differential package

[09:29] <erana> but now it's just a la hidden markov models for example, which does not use those

[09:30] <erana> It'll be a third party package, not in the distribution of course

[09:30] <erana> You can make nethack games with it, but random at init and runtime

[09:31] <erana> using SDL2::Raw for gfx

[09:33] <Altreus> Can I create a Supply.interval that is live rather than the default on-demand one?

[09:33] <erana> eventually

[09:33] <erana> init time are uniform ditributed random vars

[09:33] <erana> then at runtime you generate more

[09:34] <erana> then you calculate things happening faster as in the real world and you upgrade your enemies

[09:34] <erana> for example

[09:34] <erana> It's based on population arrays of variables and stochastics for now

[09:35] <jnthn> Altreus: Not directly but you can .share any on-demand Supply to get a live one

[09:35] <erana> ok

[10:47] <erana> I'm thinking of making a package for a math (integral/diff) problem solver

[10:48] <erana> which is better than just another math package

[10:48] <erana> so you can 'prolog' yourself out of numerical analysis for diffs/integrals

[10:48] <moritz> are you aware of the Runge/Kutta integrator in the ecosystem?

[10:48] <erana> no

[10:49] <erana> I'll search for packages later on

[10:49] <erana> it's still in the future

[10:54] <erana> the thing is you cannot describe full differential equations with it, that's why I might make a problem solver wit it

[10:55] <erana> so you can use a syntax such as LaTeX for example

[10:55] <erana> hence prolog/progol

[10:55] <moritz> erana: https://github.com/moritz/Math-RungeKutta and https://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/physical-modelling.html might be of interest

[10:55] <moritz> it always depends on what you mean by "full differential equations"

[10:55] <moritz> you can express scalar PDEs

[10:56] <erana> that should be ok but it does not use a learning algo

[10:57] <moritz> no, it uses 4th-order Runge Kutta iirc

[10:57] *** vike left
[10:58] <erana> yeah it should do

[10:58] <erana> I read it

[10:59] <erana> I need differential eqs for lagrangians 

[10:59] <erana> to support kernel methods, I still need to read that chapter

[10:59] <moritz> and for that you need a learning algorithm?

[10:59] <erana> I know the SVM (support vector machine) for it

[11:46] <masak> how do people usually capitalize their enum values?

[11:46] <masak> like THIS, like This, or like this?

[11:47] <bazzaar> these book recommendations are building up :-), perhaps we could do with a perl6 module to automate the process :-)

[11:47] <masak> the example at docs.perl6.org/language/enumeration seems to prefer the second form (`CanWrite` etc)

[11:49] <masak> the examples in design.perl6.org/S12.html#Enumerations use the second and third forms interchangeably

[11:55] <masak> a priori, I would say that the all-lowercase form makes sense (if we think of enum values as variables or properties) and the ALL_UPPERCASE form makes sense (if we think of enum values as constants)

[11:55] <masak> but the (popular) CamelCase form doesn't make sense -- it makes enum values look like a type

[12:00] <fredolaredo> Hi, is there e specific channel for perl6 beginners ?

[12:00] <masak> you're in it

[12:00] <masak> (welcome!)

[12:00] <fredolaredo> great, thanks, I didn't want to bother with silly questions 

[12:00] <masak> please do ;)

[12:01] <fredolaredo> what is the difference between pick(1..6) and (1..6).pick , don't have the same result in the perl6 REPL 

[12:02] <masak> m: say (1..6).pick

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «4␤»

[12:02] <masak> ^ this is what I would use

[12:02] <masak> I'm not familiar with the second form

[12:02] <masak> m: pick(1..6)

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: ( no output )

[12:02] <masak> m: say pick(1..6)

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[12:02] <masak> m: say pick([1..6])

[12:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[12:02] <masak> hm

[12:02] <fredolaredo> should do the same but the first needs a "say" right ? 

[12:02] <lizmat> m: pick( 1, 1..6)

[12:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: ( no output )

[12:03] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaypie

[12:04] <lizmat> hmm... looks like the +values sig is just taking the number of elements in the range

[12:04] <masak> lizmat: then why does it return () in the first few evals?

[12:04] <lizmat> because it doesn't get anything to pick from

[12:05] <fredolaredo> ???

[12:05] <evalable6> fredolaredo, rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «Stub code executed␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/sdUYfTOaYm line 1␤»

[12:05] <lizmat> the first parameter is supposed to be the number of picks you want to do

[12:05] <masak> oh!

[12:05] <lizmat> and that is taken up by the range I think

[12:05] <masak> right, that makes sense

[12:05] <fredolaredo> trying in REPL 

[12:05] <masak> forgot about that N argument :)

[12:05] <lizmat> m: sub a($n, +values) { dd $n }; a 1..10

[12:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «1..10␤»

[12:07] <masak> to be honest, I still don't understand the kind of "DWIM"/leniency in Perl 6 that prefers to return () rather than fail loudly when asked to pick > 0 elements from something empty ;)

[12:07] <masak> who benefits from that? that's just hiding a logical bug

[12:08] <fredolaredo> and how do I specify the N argument in method form ?

[12:08] <masak> m: say (1..10).pick(3)

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «(10 6 5)␤»

[12:08] <fredolaredo> ok thx 

[12:09] <lizmat> masak: well, blame TimToady way back in 2015 :-)

[12:09] <masak> I'm more interested in understanding than in blame, but OK :)

[12:09] <lizmat> but I guess we could make smarter candidates

[12:09] <jnthn> m: say (1..3).pick(5)

[12:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «(3 2 1)␤»

[12:10] <lizmat> one that takes a single iterable could be a iterable.pick

[12:10] <jnthn> I think "pick as many as you can, up to 5" isn't such a bad behavior

[12:10] <masak> yeah, maybe that's it

[12:10] <lizmat> jnthn: it's about the sub version

[12:11] <masak> reminds me of the ** {range} discussion we had recently

[12:11] <lizmat> m: dd pick( 1..10)

[12:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0d1be77ea: OUTPUT: «()␤»

[12:11] <jnthn> And handling an empty list differently creates an edge

[12:11] <masak> jnthn: yes, I withdraw my suggestion for strictness

[12:11] <masak> jnthn: "as many as you can" makes sense, and is consistent with some other behavior in ranges, substr, etc

[12:15] <jnthn> It's always a tricky one, in that strictness often feels like it might lead us to make more robust things by making potential edge cases blow up so we notice and handle them, but a reasonable default can remove edge cases and lead to a program that does the right thing in a wider range of cases.

[12:59] <[particle]> anyhow, back to perl6ing!

[13:00] <masak> "and now a word from our sponsor, Rapha..."

[13:02] <masak> since we're talking about nothing in particular anyway, you know what the most humorous thing I've found lately about any language is?

[13:02] <timotimo> please, go ahead

[13:02] <masak> in JavaScript, `null` is a keyword

[13:02] <masak> but

[13:02] <masak> `undefined` is not

[13:03] <masak> instead, it's a *global variable* whose default value just happens to be the value `undefined`

[13:03] <masak> like, I... it's...

[13:03] <masak> wh...

[13:03] <tyil> 03>javascript

[13:03] <tyil> found your issue

[13:04] <masak> tyil: it's not possible to bash JavaScript these days without also acknowledging that it has practically taken over the world while we weren't looking

[13:04] <tyil> I can bash it just fine without praising its popularity

[13:04] <tyil> mostly because I dont think popularity has anything to do with quality

[13:05] <masak> it doesn't

[13:05] <tyil> see javascript and windows for example

[13:05] <masak> it's popular because it's the language browsers run

[13:05] <tyil> I am aware of this

[13:05] <tyil> not sure what you're trying to tell me

[13:05] <masak> what I mean is that it's not realistic to try to ignore or avoid JavaScript anymore

[13:05] <tyil> oh, but it is, I still block js by default 

[13:06] <tyil> I prefer a fast web, without malware at every corner

[13:06] <masak> oh, that's fine, and your perogative

[13:06] <masak> but also not what I meant :)

[13:06] <tyil> peoply trying to say that one cannot live without javascript are silly

[13:06] <masak> I mean something like, there's a reason rakudo just got a js backend

[13:06] <tyil> because someone wanted to make it?

[13:07] *** regreg left
[13:07] <masak> I guess my main point is the same as in Eich's "always bet on JS" slide

[13:07] <tyil> I am not aware of that

[13:07] * tyil shrugs

[13:08] <tyil> I'd prefer if people would stop this silly "b-but you cant live without js" joke already

[13:08] <masak> again, that was not my point

[13:08] <tyil> it hasn't improved the web in a decade, and it wont start becoming good anytime soon

[13:09] <masak> I'm glad purists like you still exist. you fill an important purpose in the ecosystem

[13:09] <[particle]> welcome to #perl6, the channel where everything is made up, and the points don't matter.

[13:09] *** aindilis left

[13:10] *** cognominal-p6 left
[13:10] <tyil> there's still no point that I've seen, only some vague references that I pointed out I'm not familiar with

[13:10] <[particle]> https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/whose-line-is-it-anyway

[13:10] <masak> oh!

[13:11] <masak> tyil: anyway, you managed to derail my point about a specific feature about JavaScript by explaining how you never run JavaScript in your browser...

[13:11] <tyil> ok

[13:11] <masak> I'm curious how `undefined` ended up an identifier, not a keyword

[13:11] <tyil> lack of good design, probably

[13:11] <masak> or s/good //

[13:11] <tyil> fair

[13:14] <masak> I also think, in all honesty, that ES6 is a much nicer language, and much closer to (say) Perl 6, than ES3 is

[13:15] <tyil> does it have actual ints yet or is it still all floats?

[13:15] <masak> BigInt is stage 3

[13:16] <Xliff> You know... we just need to make a really fast, nice browser that uses both JS and Perl6 as scripting languages.

[13:16] <Xliff> Then just let it loose on the woild.

[13:16] <Xliff> Here's a question.... will the JVM backend allow you to NativeCall jars?

[13:17] <timotimo> no, nativecall is strictly for C. you can, however, just :from<Java> the jars

[13:18] <timotimo> "just"

[13:18] <timotimo> something something classpath something

[13:18] <Xliff> HAH! 

[13:18] <Xliff> Will that be available for Moar, in the future?

[13:18] <masak> will what be available for Moar?

[13:18] <timotimo> you can nativecall into jni or what it's called

[13:19] <timotimo> that lets you run java code

[13:19] <Xliff> Oh!

[13:19] <Xliff> OK.

[13:19] <Xliff> masak: I was trying to see if the JVM backend would be able to run Jars.

[13:19] <timotimo> i.e. you'd run your java as if you were a C or C++ program

[13:19] <Xliff> Right, so you'd have to wrap your Java code via jni.

[13:20] <timotimo> tbh i have no clue about jni

[13:20] <jast> makes sense if you're not running within the JVM

[13:20] <jast> gotta wrap _something_ around it :)

[13:20] <Xliff> jast: LOL!

[13:21] <jast> you could build a bridge that is parts java and parts perl6, I guess that would make it dual-wrapping?

[13:21] <Xliff> Well.... sorta.

[13:22] <Xliff> Actually... now that I think about it.... yes.

[13:22] <timotimo> put a TCP or unix domain socket or shared memory in between

[13:22] <Xliff> ( (JAR -> JNI) -> NativeCall) -> Perl6

[13:22] *** HaraldJoerg left
[13:22] <jast> yeah, that was the idea when I said "bridge"

[13:22] <timotimo> ah, that's what i expected

[13:23] <jast> but I'd use a pair of XML pipes

[13:23] <timotimo> sure

[13:23] <timotimo> especially on CPUs with native XML support %)

[13:23] <Xliff> jast: Yeah. Better to use multi-process, if you can.

[13:23] <jast> has the added advantage of being able to filter your java interface with XSLT and all them other goodies

[13:23] <Xliff> Talk over a socket. Use JSON, SOAP, etc.

[13:23] <jast> XML-RPC over SOAP

[13:23] <Xliff> Yeah

[13:23] <jast> now we're getting somewhere

[13:24] <Xliff> But for application logic? Stand alone machine? Airgapped?

[13:25] <jast> if all else fails you can have multiple systems communicate via cover sheets of TPS reports compiled by employees

[13:26] <jast> well, anyway. interfacing between things like java and perl6 isn't going to be all that efficient no matter what you do, so might as well be as interoperable as you can

[13:27] <jast> (where here, in a leap of laziness, perl6 stands for any impl that doesn't run on the JVM)

[13:46] * tyil shivers

[13:46] <tyil> the sad part is, I can totally see it happen :(

[13:48] <timotimo> should be easy to reverse-engineer usb drivers when they're written in javascript

[13:48] <timotimo> compared to disassembling some C compiler's output

[13:49] <tyil> then they find a way to transpile it 38 times so its neigh impossible to ever read the original source

[13:49] <timotimo> though of course javascript also usually goes through at least one compiler nowadays

[13:49] <tyil> and bundle a couple dozen trackers into it

[13:49] <timotimo> there's a windows driver for ps3 controllers

[13:49] <timotimo> it comes with a little app that you need to use to connect and configure the devices

[13:49] <timotimo> it has ads in it

[13:49] <tyil> I am not surprised

[13:50] <timotimo> there's an open source program that communicates with the same kernel driver as this program, but isn't ... shit

[13:50] <tyil> xbox controller seemed to just work on stream on gnu+linux

[13:50] <timotimo> yeah, controllers on linux are pretty good

[13:51] <timotimo> i recently tried the user-space driver for joycons. it wasn't bad. IIRC it was written in go?

[13:53] <candr> i see

[13:53] <tyil> candr: for most practical reasons, it's same enough :p

[13:53] <tyil> it depends on what you want to achieve

[13:54] <timotimo> world peace?

[13:54] <pmurias> tyil: that's what modern application platforms are ;)

[13:54] <tyil> then I'd suggest doing %updates

[13:55] <tyil> pmurias: js-based crap is a whole new level of garbage tho

[13:55] <jast> I was this >< close to making an inflammatory joke about world peace :)

[13:55] <candr> the % sigil of for the associative role then?

[13:55] <timotimo> that's right

[13:55] <timotimo> @ is for Positional

[13:55] <candr> ok

[13:56] <candr> thanks! very helpful!

[13:56] <jast> tyil: I think most people in the know will agree that it's bloat-ridden... but also nobody is solving the problem

[13:56] <timotimo> can you put "is rw" on a %foo parameter btw?

[13:56] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[13:57] <tyil> jast: not using it solves a large chunk of it

[13:57] *** kurahaupo joined
[13:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[13:57] <tyil> and not reminding everyone that you shouldn't forget js whenever you're doing *anything* isn't going to help humanity progress past it either

[13:57] <jast> I'm not really in a position where I can not use it

[13:58] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[13:58] <jast> all I can do is not write code for it

[13:58] <tyil> same at work, sadly

[13:58] <tyil> my own blog works without js tho

[13:58] <jast> which is comparably easy since I do backend development... but our frontend team does increase the JS footprint

[13:58] <tyil> disabling js will not introduce any issues while using the site

[13:58] <tyil> which is how it was intended to be used

[13:59] <jast> we're currently replacing all backend components that were written in JS

[13:59] <tyil> at least my company doesnt throw in a couple dozen tracking engines and ad malware

[13:59] <tyil> and it's not electron based either

[13:59] <jast> we essentially sell web chat widgets for websites... and for people who don't have javascript chat is close to impossible to implement decently on a website, so no loss if you have JS turned off

[13:59] <tyil> so most of the harmful parts of js are not used

[14:00] <tyil> using js sanely, as an upgrade, without breaking the website for people who dont like js, isn't too big of an issue

[14:00] <tyil> silly people will get all the silly stuff they seem to love for silly reasons

[14:00] <jast> yeah, breaking essentially static websites with JS is one of my big pet peeves, too

[14:01] <tyil> using 100mb to render a 1kb text file is what triggers me

[14:01] <tyil> and the tremendous privacy invading and malware spreading stuff as well

[14:02] <jast> yeah, at least most websites still work if you filter that out... the really bad ones actively break their site if you filter

[14:02] <tyil> I've made a shortcut to solve that issue

[14:02] <tyil> it's ^w in my browser

[14:02] *** candr left
[14:02] <jast> that's funny, I have the same shortcut

[14:02] <tyil> lb 67

[14:02] <tyil> wops

[14:03] <jast> #perl6 is now shutting down

[14:03] <tyil> (I actually dislike the ^w default shortcut, as it closes tabs when I try to delete a word)

[14:03] <shmup> i thought the joke was that it closes

[14:03] <shmup> and that does solve the issue

[14:03] <jast> yeah, I find that quite annoying, too

[14:04] <jast> though many times "undo close tab" will rescue me

[14:04] <tyil> same

[14:04] <tyil> ^T

[14:04] <jast> in firefox I have the hidden option enabled to keep the window open when the last tab closes

[14:05] <tyil> its not that common for me, I've learned to live with it

[14:05] <tyil> also it doesnt happen often that I close my last tab

[14:05] <tyil> I generally have a couple hundred of those things open

[14:05] <jast> I aggressively prune tabs

[14:06] <tyil> at one of my previous jobs a colleagua asked me to install one of those tab count addons (that display the number of open tabs)

[14:06] <tyil> and it clocked in at 2.4k

[14:06] <tyil> then I did prune some tabs

[14:06] <tyil> (there's also no good addon to deal with tree style tabs anymore in firefox, so I would've had to downscalel ater anyway)

[14:07] <jast> it's actual dual pruning: closing a tab means I'm dismissing the topic, too

[14:07] <jast> tree style tabs still exists in firefox and it's not completely useless

[14:07] <jast> except to me because I prune too much :)

[14:07] <jast> but obviously some of its benefits went away with the move to WebExtensions

[14:08] <tyil> Ive tried the new one 

[14:08] <timotimo> what is WebExtensions?

[14:08] <tyil> the webextension one

[14:08] <jast> see, mozilla *is* doing something to clean up the JS world! :-)

[14:08] <tyil> but because js is utter crap to do anything right

[14:08] <tyil> it took 100% of a cpu core to scroll through the list

[14:08] <tyil> I would drain more battery scrolling through the list than opening and reading an article

[14:08] <jast> timotimo: new API that replaces direct access to XUL/XPCOM in mozilla/firefox extensions

[14:08] <jast> basically gives the extension mechanism more control over what extensions can do

[14:09] <jast> from the extension developer's POV it means less features (which they'll allegedly add back in over time)

[14:09] <tyil> allegedly is a good word to put in there, yes :p

[14:09] <timotimo> how do you two feel about the initiative to do dns through https?

[14:09] <jast> I'm guessing the slowdown is because it used to be XUL and now it's HTML/DOM

[14:10] <tyil> timotimo: stupid to say it in kind words

[14:10] <jast> DNS through HTTPS: just webshit things

[14:10] <jast> that's the less kind words

[14:10] <tyil> throwing everything over http(s) is a silly thing that mediocre js devs use because they got no clue on how to design anything right

[14:10] <tyil> http(s) is not a cure-all for every protocol, and shouldn't be seen nor used as such

[14:11] <jast> also I still don't think virtually criminalizing non-S HTTP is a great idea

[14:11] <tyil> I'm torn on that

[14:11] <tyil> on the one hand, I think we should promote secury variants of protocols

[14:11] <tyil> on the other, the current CA system is crap

[14:12] <jast> admittedly I mainly care about it in local networks where signing things is just aggravatingly complicated

[14:12] <jast> yeah, that's the other thing

[14:12] <tyil> internally, I think it matters a lot less, but it mostly depends on what you're doing

[14:12] <jast> I'd definitely prefer a pinned pubkey in DNSSEC if anyone actually supported it

[14:12] <jast> s/any/every/

[14:13] <tyil> if your "internally" is a high security environment, then you should look into encrypted internal connections as well

[14:13] <tyil> if "internally" is "my home network that is not accessible from the outside"

[14:13] <tyil> eh, just http is fine, and less of a hassle

[14:13] <jast> yeah, and if it's not I'm looking forward to browsers showing me an error page each time I want to look at my home network's status page

[14:14] <tyil> tfw my desktop at home has a webserver running

[14:14] <tyil> it does https only for connections from the outside

[14:14] <tyil> but internally it does http

[14:14] <tyil> because you cant get a cert for an IP

[14:14] <jast> either way I'd really appreciate not having to deal with the TLS certification nonsense

[14:14] <jast> I doubt that will stop browser vendors from preventing you from accessing it (without jumping through tiny hoops) in a year's time or so

[14:17] <jast> http://127.0.0.1:8080/ THIS PAGE IS INSECURE AND YOU CAN'T VIEW IT except if you open developer tools and type (new console.developerSecurityInterface.TLS)().promptConfirm().then(x => x.overrideInsecure(console.developerSecurityInterface.TLS.UNENCRYPTED, console.developerSecurityInterface.TLS.local))

[14:17] <jast> (example made up but who knows...)

[14:18] <tyil> oh yeah, I've seen that happening too

[14:18] <tyil> browsers refusing to load a non-standard port

[14:18] <pmurias> teaching users to open developer tools is the last thing browser vendors want

[14:18] <jast> and yet that's what you have to do in chrome already, to override invalid certs

[14:18] <tyil> browser vendors dont want to make good browsers anymore

[14:18] <jast> for some types of invalid certs, anyway

[14:19] <jast> you have to open developer tools, security tab, certificate, view, something something (which is also the only way to look at the cert details)

[14:19] <jast> oh, never mind, they added details back in, it's less hidden now

[14:22] <jast> so the types of bad certs you currently can't easily override in chrome are revoked certs and certs that violate key pinning

[14:23] <jast> also ciphers that are too weak

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> “Let's wait until there is actually another Perl 6 implementation to worry about ambiguity”

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> hehe

[14:51] <AlexDaniel> and then what, change the alias? :D

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> from https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9m2k6l/a_request_to_larry_wall_to_create_a_language_name/e7i37az

[14:52] <Juerd> I'm assuming that part of waiting is also that the "then what" is delayed until it's actually relevant

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> this makes no sense whatsoever

[14:54] <Juerd> Really? I think I agree with the post.

[14:55] <Juerd> Naming doesn't have to deal with hypothetical future circumstances. It can, but it doesn't have to.

[14:55] <AlexDaniel> of course future circumstances should be considered, that's what makes the name good

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> especially considering that we already had different implementations in the past

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> and we have another implementation *even now*

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> it's not public, but it exists

[14:56] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: fanlang is not a Perl 6

[14:57] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: what is it then?

[14:57] <Juerd> There are so many languages where the executable, the runtime, and the language all share the same name. That shouldn't stop anyone from creating alternative implementations.

[14:57] <AlexDaniel> “Our Perl 6 dialect, fanlang, can now do an arith expr calculator”

[14:58] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: it's a spin-off

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> https://twitter.com/agentzh/status/826922812099043328

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> that looks like perl 6 to me

[14:59] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: it has a base in Perl 6 but it doesn't implement everything and adds it's own alternativs

[14:59] <pmurias> * alternatives

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> surely every implementation can be different in their own way

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> rakudo on jvm also doesn't implement everything

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> so it's not perl 6?

[15:00] <pmurias> it's partial Perl 6

[15:00] <AlexDaniel> and rakudo implements stuff that is not part of the spec

[15:00] <AlexDaniel> don't know if r-j has any extra functionality that's not in r-m, but does that really matter?

[15:01] <pmurias> yes

[15:01] <AlexDaniel> :S

[15:01] <pmurias> it has alternatives 

[15:01] <pmurias> so instead of grammars they have their own PEG derived syntax

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> this is just weird. First people say that other implementations is just a hypothetical future, then when presented with an actual different perl 6 implementation they say that it's not perl 6 because it implements something differently

[15:05] <Juerd> Different people :)

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> how far would the goalpost move I have no idea

[15:05] <Juerd> IIRC with the current definitions it's simple: it's Perl 6 if it passes roast

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: define “passes roast”

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> there are fudges, for example

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> so if it doesn't implement a bunch of stuff, and has fudges for these tests, does it pass roast?

[15:06] <Juerd> Yes. This might imply that none of the dialects out there is actually Perl 6

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> that's the case with r-j

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> ok nice so even rakudo-moar is not perl 6, awesome

[15:07] <Juerd> Well, if it isn't Perl 6 then we don't need any alias ;)

[15:07] <AlexDaniel> on the other hand, you shouldn't call it Perl 6 then :P

[15:08] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: is Perl 5 a Perl 6?

[15:09] <Juerd> According to practically everyone in the Dutch hacker scene, Perl is dead. I can't seem to "sell" Perl 6, because it's Perl. 

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: no, and afaik it doesn't even attempt to be it

[15:09] <AlexDaniel> unlike fanlang

[15:10] <Juerd> I wish to use Perl 6 (or whatever its name will turn out to be) in a paid job in the future, and for that I need it to be popular.

[15:10] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: fanlang doesn't attempt to pass roast

[15:10] <Juerd> I really don't really care about the exact semantics of how this is going to happen, and whether that is technically or historically correct.

[15:10] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: it adds it's own syntax

[15:11] <pmurias> Objective C isn't C++

[15:11] <Juerd> For purely practical reasons I want the thing we currently call Perl 6 to not be Perl.

[15:11] *** pmurias left
[15:11] <Juerd> More irrationally, I'd rather have people love Perl 5 and Perl 6.

[15:31] <araraloren> okay, I see

[15:31] <tony-o> scimon: the same MAIN (:$a) { } signature will take multiple -a=5 -a=6

[15:32] <scimon> And I agree with ilmari that I would expect @a to match 1 item (or zero) arrays can have less than 2 items in. 

[15:32] <araraloren> Just like the sample, and you can let the module generate help message for u, scimon

[16:18] <blork> hi. if i coded a useful TTY or CLI util in P6 and want to bundle it for friends on, say, macOS ... is there a preferred (or possible) way to do this, without the first step being "please install Perl 6" ?

[16:18] <timotimo> we have that for windows in a module called App::InstallerMaker::WiX, but i know of nothing in particular for macOS

[16:19] <timotimo> though docker is always a possibility

[16:20] <buggable> New CPAN upload: Math-FFT-Libfftw3-0.0.1.tar.gz by FRITH https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/F/FR/FRITH/Perl6/Math-FFT-Libfftw3-0.0.1.tar.gz

[16:21] <blork> interesting. yeah i guess a container could be a fallback. thx timotimo.

[16:22] <timotimo> especially for console/tty programs, though of course docker is still pretty "heavyweight" even though we have docker images for rakuto based on alpine linux

[16:23] <blork> lol i just thought of this ... self-contained P6 -> JS bundle of some sort, runnable in any browser. (i've heard this may be possible, or soon.)

[16:23] <jmerelo> blork: remember Docker is CPU architecture and kernel specific. You can't run a Linux container on Windows unless you have a Linux virtual machine running containerd

[16:23] <blork> precludes local file manipulation, etc. so a whole class of applications not possible. but interesting.

[16:23] <jmerelo> blork: that's what happens under the hood in macOSX, so you're good to ghere.

[16:24] <tyil> I thought windows finally caught up with docker

[16:24] <El_Che> jmerelo: the same happens on Windows

[16:24] <tyil> and does something similar nowadays

[16:24] <jmerelo> blork: a PoC of that was just released. So you're almost good to go.

[16:24] <blork> jmerelo: thx. yes. and it will be too heavyweight for CLI and small things anyways, as timotimo says. 

[16:25] <jmerelo> tyil: yep, but again, containers are kernel-specific. Containers can only run in the architecture you've got your daemon running. If the daemon is windows native, you can only run windows containers.

[16:25] <El_Che> it works like thta on Windows from solewhere in 2016

[16:26] <El_Che> windows versions with hyperv

[16:26] *** cognominal-p6 left
[16:26] <blork> okay, scratch containers. unless it needed to be a GUI/SDL/etc.   i suppose "please install Perl 6" (homebrew or DMG) isn't a terrible 1st step for my recipients.

[16:27] * timotimo was just now touching one of his SDL programs again

[16:27] <jmerelo> blork: definitely better than installing Docker...

[16:27] <blork> lol, yes. omg 100x yes. :-)

[16:28] <El_Che> blork: it should be ok if they use homebrew

[16:29] <blork> yeah, i don't cringe too hard asking non-tech friends on macOS to install homebrew. it's really quite lovely.

[18:26] <yoleaux> 8 Oct 2018 06:09Z <jmerelo> uzl: I don't have much time for translations. There's a small, but enthusiastic, Perl Spanish translation team that would probably be willing to help, anyway.

[18:26] <yoleaux> 8 Oct 2018 06:10Z <jmerelo> uzl: I can take a look anyway.

[18:41] <timotimo> what's keeping you from using a multi-file module at the moment?

[18:42] *** uzl joined
[18:43] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v uzl

[18:43] <Demos[m]> lemme post a gist

[18:45] <Demos[m]> https://gist.github.com/barcharcraz/0e0ba8f64b86544856e156ee1573fe1c

[18:45] <uzl> .tell jmerelo They're welcome to take a look at it. https://uzluisf.gitlab.io/piensaperl6/ <- gitlab page which also has a link to the repo.

[18:45] <yoleaux> uzl: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[18:46] <Demos[m]> so like I want to be able to import stuff from a bunch of files with one use statement

[18:46] <Demos[m]> I know in 6.d I can have "use Base::Test :ALL :EXPORT" in Base.pm6

[18:46] <Demos[m]> but that doesn't work in 6.c

[18:48] <timotimo> oh, i didn't even know about that

[18:48] <timotimo> though maybe it works if you put , in between?

[18:49] <Demos[m]> nope

[18:49] <timotimo> huh

[18:49] <Demos[m]> well it would probably work in 6.d

[18:49] <moritz> I don't think so

[18:49] <Demos[m]> but like, how can I do what I want, which is to have something like re-exporting

[18:49] <moritz> it's been speculated about all along

[18:50] <moritz> so if somebody had implemented it, they wouldn't have bothered putting it behind the 6.d firewall

[18:50] *** yqt left
[18:50] *** metelik_ joined
[18:51] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v metelik_

[18:51] *** metelik__ left
[18:51] <Demos[m]> it could be that it just doesn't work in the perl6 that's in f28

[18:51] *** dogbert17 joined
[18:51] <Demos[m]> but I want to support f28

[18:51] <Demos[m]> is this just like, not possible?

[18:51] <Demos[m]> seems like somewhat of a big deal

[18:52] <moritz> only somewhat :-)

[18:52] <moritz> you could try to implement it if it's important to you

[18:53] <SmokeMachine> Demos[m]: I'm reexporting stuff like this: https://github.com/FCO/Red/blob/master/lib/Red.pm6

[18:53] <Demos[m]> that's just what I need

[18:55] <Demos[m]> there's even a test for re-exporting in roast

[18:55] <Demos[m]> but it looks like rakudo doesn't run it???

[18:57] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[18:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[18:58] *** vrurg left
[19:01] <timotimo> it could either be fudged, like with #todo or #skip, or it could be missing from spectest.data

[19:02] *** dedelafrite left
[19:03] <Demos[m]> it's missing from spectest.data

[19:03] <Demos[m]> is that a bug? should I fix that

[19:05] <Demos[m]> OK going through Base::Test::foo works, even if foo is not exported and I don't use :EXPORT??

[19:05] <Demos[m]> and even if Test.pm6 is unit module Base::Test

[19:06] <Demos[m]> is that intended?

[19:06] <moritz> is foo declared as our?

[19:06] <Demos[m]> yes

[19:06] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:06] *** AlexDaniel joined
[19:07] <Demos[m]> that seems transitive, which is common, but not what I was expecting based on the perl6 docs

[19:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v AlexDaniel

[19:08] *** kensanata left
[19:09] <moritz> "our" means it's accessible through the namespace

[19:09] <moritz> if you don't want that, use "my" instead

[19:10] *** cognominal-p6 left
[19:10] *** cognominal-p6 joined
[19:10] <Demos[m]> what if I want it accessable through the namespace from Base.pm6 but not from importers of Base.pm6

[19:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v cognominal-p6

[19:11] <moritz> either it's available or not

[19:59] <tony-o> is that in one of those files that i'm not seeing?

[19:59] *** sena_kun left
[20:00] <timotimo> i think you jus tput --backend=js in Configure.pl

[20:01] <[Coke]> perl Configure.pl --gen-nqp --gen-moar --backends=moar,js

[20:01] <tony-o> is this only on the `js` branch?

[20:02] <timotimo> hasn't it been merged recently?

[20:02] <lizmat> yes, it has been merged

[20:02] <lizmat> don't you two read the Perl 6 Weekly ?

[20:02] <lizmat> https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2018/10/08/2018-41-merged-the-js/   :-)

[20:22] <tony-o> also not a fan of SO

[20:23] <tyil> it usually gets my questions answered, so it serves its purpose for me

[20:24] <tyil> its generally a better way to pose questions than irc, when the question requires some context

[20:24] <tyil> and faster response times than the ML

[20:27] <tony-o> i find a gist or repo to be nicer for providing context to questions in irc..my experience with SO was it mostly looked like a gamification of answering questions and in doing that a lot of people answer questions with a 'make it work so i can get imaginary points', i haven't looked at it much in the last 3 or 4 years though

[20:28] <tyil> I think it helps that most of my questions are Perl 6 related, and the Perl 6 community is by far the friendliest I've been in

[20:28] <tyil> many web centric communities are just very toxic in general

[20:56] <shmup> it's all noise you dont need

[20:56] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Kaiepi

[20:56] <shmup> and to call the perl6 the friendliest community youve been in, is a very reddit sort of comment

[20:56] *** st_elmo left
[20:57] <shmup> i hate communities mostly because of the circlejerking

[21:04] <tyil> shmup: or it might've been true ;)

[21:04] <pyrimidine> tyil++

[21:04] <shmup> it could be tyil 

[21:05] <tyil> after a decade on irc, I've been in many, many channels across many networks, and most programming or distro related channels haven't been the most friendly of places

[21:05] <tyil> and I can easily say I've been on the unfriendly side in those channels plenty of times

[21:07] <tyil> though I can also say that not every engagement in here has been friendly, nor do I expect it to be, but in general, I've had very few problems in here

[21:28] <Kaiepi> i don't think of perl6 as a circlejerk

[21:29] <Kaiepi> people aren't afraid to shit on your bad code in a nice way and that's a good thing
