[00:44] <raschipi> ktown: https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#Coercion_Types

[00:48] *** mcmillhj left
[00:49] <ktown> I started forcing types becasue the dynamic types did not do what I was expecting

[00:51] <ktown> m: sub got( $x where ^10 ) { dd $x }; got "3"

[00:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$x'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Str ("3")␤  in sub got at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:58] <ktown> the option to enforce a type is good, as is the option to force a specific coercion, but failing on a simple int math comparison :(

[00:58] <raschipi> m: "3" ~~ ^10

[00:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: ( no output )

[00:58] <raschipi> m: say "3" ~~ ^10

[00:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[00:58] <raschipi> m: say +"3" ~~ ^10

[00:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[01:00] <raschipi> m: sub got( Numeric() $x where ^10 ) { dd $x }; got "3"

[01:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[01:00] <raschipi> m: sub got( Numeric() $x where ^10 ) { dd $x }; got "13"

[01:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$x'; expected anonymous constraint to be met but got Int (13)␤  in sub got at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[01:01] <ktown> perl -e 'print "3" eq 3' => 1

[01:01] <ktown> perl -e 'print "3" == 3' => 1

[01:01] *** mcmillhj joined
[01:03] <raschipi> Yeah, Perl 6 doesn't go that far, you need to use either explicit coercion or use one of the operators that will coerce automatically. Smartmatch doesn't autocoerce.

[01:04] <raschipi> Smartmatch isn't a typed operator, it doesn't know if it should do numeric or string comparisson.

[01:05] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[01:06] <raschipi> m: say "3" eq 3; say "3" == 3

[01:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[01:07] <raschipi> Those are typed, one will coerce to string and the other will coerce to numeric

[01:07] <raschipi> That's because they have Str() or Numeric() in their signatures

[01:08] <ktown> yes, but it did not do that with the signature, but more odd was sometimes is did and sometimes it did not

[01:09] <raschipi> Well, if it doesn't coerce for you, prefix + and prefix ~ will

[01:09] <ktown> the odd bit, I was looping a list of strings and after a few it would error

[01:10] *** mcmillhj_ left

[01:32] <raschipi> vector based or cartesian based?

[01:32] <ktown> it's vi bindings... l is right

[01:33] <raschipi> right of the turtle or absolute right?

[01:36] <ktown> l one "pixel" to the right

[01:36] <raschipi> To the right of the screen?

[01:36] <ktown> relative to the current cursor position

[01:37] <raschipi> So it's not really a turtle graphics program

[01:38] <ktown> no, it's an etch-a-sketch

[01:39] <raschipi> That would be fun too

[01:47] <raschipi> what does  x,y,z do?

[01:48] <ktown> teleport, x,y,p p=1 will write, p=0 is pen up

[01:49] <raschipi> is the grid numbered starting at 0 or 1?

[01:50] <raschipi> doesn't matter

[01:50] <ktown> it's perl, array are zero indexed

[01:51] <ktown> the timer is running

[01:52] <raschipi> I will take some more time then, can't have enought of it

[01:55] <raschipi> No idea what it is

[02:02] <ktown> git is one of those spells you cast at the commandline

[02:04] *** mcmillhj_ left
[02:26] <raschipi> yes it is, do you know how to do it?

[02:27] <Summertime> just make an alias `git pulshmit` and use it for everything, works fine

[02:30] <Kaiepi> git's confusing at first but it's not as bad as some of the alternatives out there

[02:30] <Kaiepi> the only cvs command i know is up

[02:31] <ktown> is that a real command?? or a euphemism for pull shit?

[02:31] <geekosaur> short for update

[02:31] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[02:32] <geekosaur> oh, the Summertime comment. that wasn't in base git/ but git is extensible to the point that there's noi promises there isn't one *somewhere*

[02:32] <ktown> i have only used it a bit, need to learn more

[02:32] <geekosaur> and some of the stuff I've seen in git extensions is ...

[02:32] <Summertime> pulsh is common for pull push

[02:32] <Summertime> I was joking that commit should be added to that as well

[02:33] <Kaiepi> mercurial has some useful extensions

[03:02] *** atweiden-air joined
[03:02] <atweiden-air> if you have a module like `use ABC; use DEF; unit module XYZ;`, can you make it so that doing `use XYZ` elsewhere is also using `ABC` and `DEF`?

[03:02] <ktown> I started with only 0-9 as ascii greyscale, then added unicode chars, then added 32-126, but really one can create any non standard char mapping.

[03:02] <atweiden-air> how can unit class XYZ export `use ABC; use DEF`?

[03:03] <atweiden-air> looking at the docs (https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#EXPORT), `sub EXPORT` shortname looked promising, but it isn't working for me in unit module XYZ

[03:04] *** mcmillhj left
[03:07] <ktown> raschipi: yes the Numeric() changes the turtle! 

[03:08] *** Zoffix joined
[03:09] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: what code you got?

[03:09] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: here's a sample of a module that uses a bunch of stuff and exports the symbols from the used sub whenever just the module is used: http://modules.perl6.org/dist/P5built-ins:cpan:ELIZABETH/lib/P5built-ins.pm6#L3

[03:11] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: basically this http://ix.io/1b7w

[03:11] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: put it before `unit ...`

[03:12] <Zoffix> s/it/sub EXPORT/;

[03:13] *** mcmillhj joined
[03:14] <Zoffix> atweiden-air: works: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/eb5863c40a1bcff441654a400d76fe74

[03:15] <Zoffix> but if you place sub EXPORT after the `unit` bit, it becomes a sub inside that thing, rather than a global

[03:15] <raschipi> Zoffix: do you have any plans for modules.perl6.org to render pod like Github does?

[03:16] <atweiden-air> Zoffix: ic

[08:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «(2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229 233 239 241 251 257 263 269 271 277 281 283 293 307 311 313 317 331 337 347 349…»

[08:08] <dominix> ok, how could I say. I taken isprime as example,but my function is not linear, and is time based ... so basically I have to test on the result, not on the input.

[08:10] *** mcmillhj left
[08:10] <dominix> I will try until infinite, so "for ((^∞)." is a good begining, then my func apply ... and then I would like to test and stop if I have reached 1000

[08:10] <dominix> as a result

[08:18] <jmerelo> dominix: you can try generators: https://docs.perl6.org/routine/....html

[08:18] <jmerelo> dominix: also, formulate the question in StackOverflow :-)

[08:19] <jmerelo> m: say 1, 1, * + * … * < 1000

[08:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «(1)␤»

[08:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar d1d31fd57: OUTPUT: «(1)␤»

[08:20] <dominix> yes generators seem the right way

[11:49] <lizmat> .oO( cool seeing changes to French version with Spanish commit messages )

[11:50] <jmerelo> lizmat: she's someone from Granada, actually, although I don't really know her. 

[11:50] <jmerelo> lizmat: that makes three translations from Granada: Spanish, French and Japanese... :-)

[11:50] <El_Che> maybe it's the prelude of a Catalan version, being a language pretty much in the middle of Spanish and French linguistically

[11:50] <jmerelo> El_Che: that, or occitan :-)

[11:51] <raschipi> Gonna start sending changes to the English version with Portuguese commit messages.

[11:54] <jmerelo> Rmarkdown, scripts, data is in the repo too. I'll upload it to ResearchGate pretty soon, when I've polished it a bit.

[11:55] <jmerelo> That's also open science (or source, or whatever), so feel free to send pull requests and comments.

[11:55] <El_Che> jmerelo: are you having fun during the grant? :)

[11:55] <jmerelo> El_Che: I always do when I learn new stuff :-)

[11:56] <jmerelo> Gist of it is: self organizing works pretty well, all things considered, but a thin management layer could boost productivity. 

[11:56] <jmerelo> But no spoiler, you'll have to read the report beyond the pretty charts :-)

[11:58] <jmerelo> As an immediate conclusion, it would be good to label all open issues... There are quite a few with no labels yet. I'll try to do it later on today or maybe tomorrow, I'm doing a graffiti workshop this afternoon.

[17:11] *** rindolf joined
[17:14] <raschipi> Because it's "EXCLUSIVE"-or.

[17:15] <raschipi> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/$CIRCUMFLEX_ACCENT$CIRCUMFLEX_ACCENT link above got mangled.

[17:16] <mcmillhj> oh whoops, I was actually meaning to use https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#infix_+^

[17:16] <mcmillhj> thanks raschipi

[18:54] <skids> Success: I see people ask whether PDL/Perl6 is available yet once in a while, and some hint they may start on it, but nothing seems to be in the ecosystem yet.

[19:00] <raschipi> Success: Maybe Nativecall a C/C++ library?

[22:56] <Summertime> wait no that wouldn't work

[22:56] <Summertime> context: perl6 -pe 'next if not s/"data: "//'

[22:57] <Summertime> wanting to skip every line that doesn't match the s///, instead of printing it unaffected

[22:58] <MasterDuke> Summertime: couldn't you just do perl6 -ne 'say if s/"data: "//' instead?

[23:00] <Summertime> oh found `next unless X`

[23:00] <Summertime> and yeah I could but then I need to work out if its say, gist, print, etc

[23:01] <Summertime> for the output I want x-x

[23:02] <Summertime> and it would need to be .say to pull the $_ in implicitly
