[10:25] <El_Che> lol

[10:26] <El_Che> be honest, you're all illuminati!

[10:26] <El_Che> did you do the secret handshake? :)

[10:26] <jmerelo> El_Che: I offered them tea, but they were in a hurry :-) They didn't leave without me telling them about Perl 6, of course :-)

[10:27] <jmerelo> El_Che: unfortunately, they didn't found it noteworthy.

[10:27] <El_Che> I bet  you asked them to post question on SO

[10:27] <jmerelo> I mean newsworthy.

[10:27] <jmerelo> El_Che: :-) that will have to wait until next time

[10:27] <El_Che> did you tell them it's a new blockchain language?

[10:29] <jmerelo> El_Che: Lol

[10:33] <jmerelo> El_Che: :-) That's probably NOT SPECCED, so I don't have to document it :-)

[10:34] <El_Che> on the other hand, that specific grant would pay for itself, quite literally

[10:46] <El_Che> the fact that you can combine grantwork with staying a few days at home and cook for the family is a huge win

[12:54] <timotimo> i'm not sure if P5 regexes get any optimization at all from the optimizer

[12:54] <jnthn> masak: I'm somewhat doubtful; I/O these days is optimzied to the point that UTF-8 line reading in Perl 6 matches or slightly beats Perl 5. Perl 5 still wins on the "encodings? what is those?" case. :)

[12:54] <jnthn> But only by a factor of ~3

[12:55] <MasterDuke> rindolf: most of the time is spent in Match and Str methods. i'm not sure there's much to do until perl 6's regex related stuff gets some optimization thrown at it

[12:55] <rindolf> MasterDuke: ah

[12:56] *** Kaiepi joined
[12:56] <MasterDuke> timotimo: the top entry in a profile is `<anon> <unknown>:<unknown>`. is that cause something got inlined and/or jitted?

[12:56] <masak> would be fun to hand-code that regex in C or something, to see how fast it could run in theory

[12:56] <timotimo> shouldn't be

[12:59] <MasterDuke> also, a couple of the top things aren't jitted. the BAILs are coerce_Si (which i think samcv's recent PR adds) and ctxouter

[13:10] <timotimo> the input file has not a single line that would match the regex

[13:11] <timotimo> in fact, the input files look like they are actually the output files, and the actual input files aren't in the repo

[13:14] <dogbert17> timotimo: the latest nqp bump added jstuder's PR containing the chain ops fix. That should hopefully improve the performance of rindolf's previous example

[13:16] <AlexDaniel> rewriting the regex in perl6 gives a slight improvement

[13:17] <AlexDaniel> m/^(<[0..9]>+)‚Äò = Verdict: ‚Äô(Intractable|Solved|Unsolved)‚Äò ; Iters: ‚Äô<[0..9]>+‚Äò ; Length: ‚Äô[<[0..9]>+|‚Äò-‚Äô1]$/

[13:18] <rindolf> timotimo: which input file?

[13:19] <timotimo> the file that you would run the .p6 script on

[13:19] <dogbert17> rindolf: probablu http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/text/0fc-log.lg.txt.xz does it contain the right data?

[13:19] <rindolf> timotimo: it is dogbert17 's link

[13:20] <rindolf> timotimo: heh, i avoid caffeinated drinks

[13:21] <El_Che> rindolf: do you keep all these different python-pypy-perl6 comparisons in a central repo?

[13:22] <rindolf> El_Che: not really

[13:22] <El_Che> rindolf: it looks interesting to run them constantly or at least with new versions

[13:22] <AlexDaniel> changing $0 to ~$0 shaves off some seconds

[13:22] <rindolf> El_Che: some of them are in https://github.com/shlomif/project-euler

[13:23] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: how does ~ instead of .join do?

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: same I think

[13:24] <El_Che> rindolf: you added perl6 along the way it seems

[13:24] <AlexDaniel> yeah, looks same to me

[13:24] <dogbert17> rindolf: did the solutuion to your previous code example end with ...496 ?

[13:25] <rindolf> dogbert17: which one?

[13:25] <dogbert17> rindolf: my $N = 24; my $E = 1 +< ($N-1); ...

[13:30] <rindolf> dogbert17: it is better than my p6 time, but much slower than pypy and c

[13:31] <AlexDaniel> rindolf: eh, does changing .say to .put show any difference on your machine?

[13:32] <rindolf> AlexDaniel: should i also add a "\n"?

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> hm‚Ä¶ false alarm, I guess there's no difference, and the stars simply aligned just right :)

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> is there something wrong with doing regex matches in hyper for?

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> I have this: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/8c3a9cf26a74df0adc2c5f6ed0be12eb

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> but the output is different if you remove hyper

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> the run time is half though

[13:45] <timotimo> i've written a replacement that uses .words on the line and does some manual validation and it's no faster

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: can you take a look at my hyper version?

[13:50] <timotimo> throwing out the verification of the numeric fields that we aren't using makes it a bunch faster

[13:52] <timotimo> completely without verification it gets down to about 30 seconds, which still isn't good

[14:00] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: You probably need to declare `my $/` inside of the loop

[14:01] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Arguably the `hyper` or `race` on a loop should do that automatically for you, as we do for `start` blocks

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> oh, that helps

[14:01] *** brrt joined
