[14:04] <jc_denton_> Hello! I have a small question. I feel a bit silly asking. I'm writing some inline documentation but I haven't seen the command to just read the pod like how you could do perldoc on a file. Does such a command exist?

[14:13] *** cdg left
[14:18] <jc_denton_> lizmat: Is p6doc just the perl6 docs? the github makes it sound like it's a copy of the perl6 docs which isn't what I was looking for.

[14:37] <jc_denton_> The rest of the error seemed to be just tracting back through thr zef client.

[14:38] <jc_denton_> It's a liittle odd because it is on my colleagues machine already. just not mine.

[14:38] <moritz> so, can you resolve rakudo.org?

[14:42] <jc_denton_> I can just fine.

[14:43] <moritz> and the colleague too?

[14:49] <jc_denton_> I assume so since we are on the same network but p6doc was already on his machine.

[19:33] <jimav> How is zef installed?  Somewhere the docs said it comes with rakudo-star, but it's not in the Ubuntu 'rakudo' package.  So I downloaded & built rakudo-star-2018.01 but it did not install anything named "zef" under --prefix dir.  

[19:35] <timotimo> huh, yeah, the readme doesn't tell you

[19:35] <timotimo> though perhaps it outputted something during the installation

[19:35] <moritz> you can clone the git repo

[19:35] <moritz> the zef git repo, that is

[19:36] <moritz> and its readme describes how to install it

[19:36] <moritz> or

[19:36] *** b2gills joined
[19:36] <moritz> use the packages from https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[19:36] <moritz> and then run install-zef-as-user

[19:41] <squashable6> AlexDaniel, ‚ö†üçï Next SQUASHathon in ‚âà14 hours (2018-03-03 UTC-12‚åÅUTC+14). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[19:44] <jimav> Ach!   I did "make" not "make install".    ("make" seems to install some things anyway, which is a bit odd...)  But all is well now!

[19:44] <[Coke]> \o/

[20:27] <SCHAPiE> timotimo: over here, it ended up in /usr/share/perl6/vendor/bin/zef

[20:27] <SCHAPiE> ehm i meant: jimav

[20:28] <SCHAPiE> so i just put export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/perl6/vendor/bin in my ~/.zshrc

[21:53] <thowe> It I like embedded Perl templates as provided by Mojolicious, is there a a way to do templates similarly with Perl6?

[21:53] <thowe> s/It/If/

[21:54] <DrForr> There's a Template::Mojo in the ecosystem, but I'm headed to bed so I can't hang around :(

[21:54] <yoleaux> 22 Feb 2018 23:40Z <Zoffix> DrForr: you have a moldy PR unbreaking your module being listed in ecosystem: https://github.com/drforr/perl6-ANTLR4/pull/15

[21:54] <thowe> Cro seems to be the new hotness and I want to see if I can do something for work with it.

[21:55] <DrForr> Aiyee.

[21:57] <DrForr> .tell Zoffix pushed.

[21:57] <yoleaux> DrForr: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[21:58] <DrForr> .tell Zoffix (for perl6-ANTLR, that is)

[21:58] <yoleaux> DrForr: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[21:59] <DrForr> thowe: Cro was my latest side project before getting sidetracked on Markdown stuff, it's fun. I had some issues at the start because it was close to Dancer but buggy enough the way I was using it that it caused some issues, but once my coe settled down it was fie.

[21:59] <[Coke]> coe?

[21:59] <[Coke]> (at previous dayjob that's "Center of Excellence")

[22:00] <timotimo> code i think?

[22:00] <DrForr> *code *fine

[22:01] <DrForr> My laptop keyboard is bending around the '3'-'c' axis so those keys are a bit wonky.

[22:02] <thowe> I have a couple of things still using CGI, and I was going to replace with Mojo lite...  Another guy at work who I have managed to bring in to the world of Perl also likes Mojo and has interest in Perl6.  I think he would be down for a Cro replacement.

[22:02] <thowe> The other guy likes Ruby, so we might get him interested eventually.

[22:03] <thowe> We actually have production code running Mojo now.

[22:03] <thowe> Cro might just be the Perl6 gateway drug we need

[22:03] *** SyrupThinker left
[22:06] <DrForr> Mojo was meant for a fll async core, so of {Dancer, Mojo} Mojo would be the closest fit. I haven't use Mojo so I can't say, but from what I've followed on the channel...

[22:09] <DrForr> .tell Zoffix passed on Travis, thanks again.

[22:09] <yoleaux> DrForr: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.
