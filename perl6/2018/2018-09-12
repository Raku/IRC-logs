[00:20] * geekosaur wonders at what pont this becomes "so if what works better for everyone else doesn't work for you, you may have to wait until someone comes up with a version of the docs that works for you"

[00:21] <timotimo> i do have to agree that some examples are pretty bad :)

[00:22] <geekosaur> neverteless. he's repatedly asserted tat perldocis the only corect way to doit

[00:23] <timotimo> i didn't interpret it as "perldoc is the only correct way"

[00:23] <timotimo> just that perldoc is more useful because it's less "academically" written i suppose?

[00:30] *** graphene joined
[00:31] <[Coke]> one note about the perldoc stuff; I don't liek the thought of adding the p5 style func THING, OTHERTHING because I really don't see how that improves over the literal signature.

[00:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v graphene

[00:32] <[Coke]> which I argued with dha about back in the day, I think. I absolutely agree that having a page on "how the docs work" would be a great thing, though, explaining common signature elements, among other things.

[11:41] <ZzZombo> I've been watching the "no isms" commits today, and while they are on the right track, I don't agree with those silly restrictions where valid AND harmless syntax is forbidden out of fear that somebody somewhere manages to shoot himself or something.

[11:43] <ZzZombo> The `new Foo` thing specifically is so stupid, I don't even. I'd actually expect there to be a `sub` version of the `new` method to do `Foo.new`, in line in all others sub versions of methods.

[11:46] <timotimo> i disagree. "new" is only a convention in perl6

[11:48] <ZzZombo> But then again, restricting that lies in line with forcing a specific way of working with class (composition over inheritance, private-public only access levels, etc), in contrary with the supposed freedom of choosing your way of things, i. e. typed vs untyped variables.

[11:49] <ZzZombo> Disagree with what? `new Foo` is a valid syntax?

[11:49] <ZzZombo> It may be just a convention, but doesn't justify forbidding it as a whole.

[11:50] <timotimo> you can already write "new Foo:"

[11:50] <timotimo> no need for a sub

[11:50] <timotimo> and this syntax works with every method, rather than just with "new"

[11:55] <pmurias_> timotimo: why do we need a hard ban on new Foo instead of just having a custom error message if a &new sub is not is scop

[13:30] <AlexDaniel> well, I specifically made that ticket to cover a very narrow scope (variables only)

[13:30] <AlexDaniel> but people want to discuss the whole thing so much :)

[13:31] *** mscha joined
[13:31] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mscha

[13:31] <AlexDaniel> also, many 5to6 and 4to6 error messages for variables are now gone

[13:31] <AlexDaniel> since May

[13:31] <mscha> m: for ^3 { for ^3 { once { say 'foo' } } }

[13:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a9105ae2: OUTPUT: «foo␤foo␤foo␤»

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> mscha: that's correct

[13:32] <mscha> “A block prefix with once will be executed exactly once, even if placed inside a loop or a recursive routine.”

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> huh… now that's wrong

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> I mean, the description

[13:32] <AlexDaniel> mscha: a proper-er description is here: https://docs.perl6.org/language/traps#Using_an_once_block

[13:33] <mscha> I figured.  Either the doc or the functionality must be wrong.  ;-)

[13:34] <AlexDaniel> and then the doc goes to say “This works per "clone" of the containing code object, so:”

[13:36] <mscha> But in my example there aren't any clones of code objects, no?

[13:37] <AlexDaniel> but are there any “clones” :P

[13:38] <AlexDaniel> IMO `once` is pretty confusing, and having no clear description in the docs is not cool

[13:39] <AlexDaniel> that traps section is actually alright, but too long

[13:39] <lizmat> "once" has changed its name already a few times

[13:40] <lizmat> FWIW, I believe it follows the same logic as state variables wrt scoping

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> yes

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: what were its names?

[13:40] <lizmat> as it internally uses a state variable to keep state  :-)

[13:41] <lizmat> I guess a bisect on "once 42" should tell you when it changed

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> bisect: old=2014.01 once say 42

[13:42] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, On both starting points (old=2014.01 new=5a9105a) the exit code is 0 and the output is identical as well

[13:42] <bisectable6> AlexDaniel, Output on both points: «42␤»

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: 2014.01 is the first rakudo on moar, unfortunately :)

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> pretty sure there's a ticket somewhere asking to add parrot builds to whateverable

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> but IIRC even 2014.01 is not buildable with the latest perl5… and the only reason I have those is because at the time the server had a slightly older version

[13:46] <mscha> m: sub foo { once say 'a'; for ^3 { once say 'b' }; once say 'c'; }; foo for ^3; # confusing

[13:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5a9105ae2: OUTPUT: «a␤b␤c␤b␤b␤»

[13:48] <scimon> So a while ago (just before LPW 2017) I wrote a script that would spider through a directory and look in each file within it for matching strings. (Recursively grepping). At the time it was slower than just running find and egrep. Ran it today in my company dojo where we were discussing Channels and Supplies and it's now faster on my laptop than the find / grep method. 

[13:48] <scimon> I should probably blog that.

[13:48] <AlexDaniel> BLOG IT!!!

[13:48] <AlexDaniel> :)

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> scimon: are you sure that it's correct though?

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> because I'm really surprised

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> mscha: so b is once per sub and a/b are once per mainline I guess?

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> a/c**

[13:52] <timotimo> "once" has the same semantics as "state", i believe

[13:52] <timotimo> so when a block gets a closure taken, it'll get its own state, and when the closure gets invoked multiple times it'll have the same state

[13:53] <timotimo> so when you enter foo, the inner loop gets its closure taken and executed three times

[13:53] <timotimo> and when the mainline is entered, the "once say 'a'" gets its closure taken

[13:53] <timotimo> so that gets executed once in total

[13:53] <scimon> So the script fires up 5 promises one does spidering passing IO objects into a channel.

[13:54] <timotimo> scimon: it may not be easy, but can you find out if it's actually giving the same results and performing about the same work?

[13:55] <scimon> So I've got a folder with 100 subfolders. Each has 100 files. Each has 500 lines each is a 100 character random string.

[13:55] <AlexDaniel> also, ssd or hdd? First run or not?

[13:56] <scimon> ssd

[13:56] <scimon> Not first run/

[13:56] <scimon> I have a script called lof which has this in it "find . -type f -exec egrep "$1" {} /dev/null \;"

[13:57] <timotimo> why wouldn't you use the recursive flag for egrep?

[13:57] <timotimo> oh, $1?

[13:57] <scimon> On my box that's taking 8 seconds. real	0m7.366s, user	0m4.287s, sys	0m2.497s

[13:57] <timotimo> so it'd search for the file name inside the file?

[13:57] <scimon> So I can do lof 1234567890 

[13:57] <timotimo> ah, no, $1 is what you pass to lof

[13:57] <scimon> (Turns out 1 of my random strings has that in it)

[13:58] <scimon> The perl6 version times : real	0m2.486s, user	0m7.252s, sys	0m0.370s

[13:58] *** mscha left
[13:59] <timotimo> 4 cores?

[13:59] <AlexDaniel> so 3x as fast…

[13:59] <scimon> 4 cores and 4 promises doing the grepping.

[13:59] <scimon> 1 promise spiders through the folder and feeds into a channel then closes it and stops.

[14:00] <scimon> I was a bit shocked when it worked out faster.

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> well… I still don't believe it :D

[14:00] <timotimo> it doesn't have to exec processes over and over

[14:01] <scimon> (It was a bit slower when I was demoing it but I was doing a hangout stream)

[14:01] <timotimo> you can see that the egrep version has 2.5 seconds of system time

[14:01] <timotimo> i.e. time spent doing system calls and such

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> then, what about using xargs to batch files?

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> and maybe parallelize as well

[14:02] <timotimo> so the execing and folder reading and all that is taking as long as the perl6 version takes in total (when on 4 cores)

[14:02] <scimon> These' might be cool and if people can tell me how. lof is something I made ages ago and use a lot because I know it.

[14:04] *** zakharyas left
[14:04] <scimon> Ok so using grep -drecurse gives these times : real	0m2.183s, user	0m0.591s, sys	0m0.292s

[14:04] *** zakharyas joined
[14:04] <timotimo> that's not that much faster than perl6, though of course it only uses one core

[14:04] <scimon> Still that's not a bad comparison.

[14:05] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zakharyas

[14:05] <timotimo> but grep can use regex and you're probably using .contains? ;)

[14:05] <scimon> I am. Oh boy am I.

[14:06] <scimon> But I think it's still pretty good. And the code to write it is pretty simple.

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> scimon: find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n5 echo

[14:06] *** yqt left
[14:06] *** aborazmeh joined
[14:06] *** aborazmeh left
[14:06] *** aborazmeh joined
[14:06] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aborazmeh

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> scimon: something like that. It echo's 5 files per run

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> scimon: and then also add -P4

[14:07] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v aborazmeh

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> so that it does at least 4 processes at a time

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> perhaps you can increase it to 5 to improve the result a bit more

[14:07] <scimon> Yeah. That's faster.

[14:08] <scimon> real	0m0.807s user	0m0.970s sys	0m0.409s

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> ok that makes more sense

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> so now in parallel?

[14:08] <timotimo> huh, how come the user + sys isn't that much more than real?

[14:09] <scimon> I have no idea. I'm just writing numbers.

[14:09] <scimon> Anyway. I'm pretty sure it's a lot faster than this time last year :)

[14:09] <timotimo> :)

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> by the way I love xargs

[14:10] <timotimo> gnu parallel is also nice

[14:10] <AlexDaniel> the name doesn't sound like it can solve problems like this, but it works so well

[14:10] <scimon> Also it's a good framework for more extendable stuff.

[15:50] <ofperfection> Hey guys, I have a question on regexs that I wasn't able to find in the docs, which typically implies that I'm doing something completely wrong

[15:50] *** mcmillhj left
[15:50] <ofperfection> specifically, I'm wondering if you can implement a range in a regex pattern

[15:51] <ofperfection> i.e.: my $regex-name = /{1..@arr.elems}/

[15:51] <timotimo> what exactly do you want the range to match?

[15:52] <timotimo> m: my $rex = /^ <{ 9..30 }> $/; say "5" ~~ $rex; say "19" ~~ $rex;

[15:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «Nil␤｢19｣␤»

[15:52] <ofperfection> I have a simple to do list application

[15:53] <timotimo> interpolating an array (or positional things in general, which ranges also are) will act like a longest-token-matching alternation (single vertical bar, |) of the individual array elements

[15:53] *** mcmillhj joined

[15:55] <ofperfection> basically as written

[15:55] <ofperfection> I'm just trying to match the '1' in the "1 modify" string

[15:56] <ofperfection> I realize I'm not doing the regexs correctly

[15:56] <ofperfection> I think what you said answers it

[15:56] <ofperfection> I appreciate the help

[15:57] <timotimo> no problem :)

[15:58] <sena_kun> ofperfection, I think what you want can be done without regexes. You want to 1)in this exact case("1 modify") just split the string by space(s); 2)get first piece and convert it to integer. But regexes can help you validate input that user gives you.

[15:58] <sena_kun> so it's like

[15:59] <sena_kun> m:say "1 modify" ~~ /\d+ ' ' \w+/

[15:59] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «｢1 modify｣␤»

[15:59] <sena_kun> m: say "bad input modify" ~~ /\d+ ' ' \w+/

[15:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[15:59] <sena_kun> and then

[15:59] <sena_kun> m: say "1 modify".split(' ').first.Int

[15:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[15:59] <sena_kun> m: say "1 modify".split(' ')[0].Int # if you want

[15:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[16:00] <timotimo> i tend to recommend .words over .split(" ")

[16:00] <sena_kun> timotimo++

[16:00] <sena_kun> that's nice too.

[16:00] <sena_kun> also, maybe...

[16:01] <sena_kun> m: say "1 modify" ~~ /\d+ ' ' ['modify'|'add']/

[16:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 213e3282b: OUTPUT: «｢1 modify｣␤»

[16:01] <ofperfection> My aim was to validate the item number selection with the dynamic regex range, which I could also do after by checking the respective .Int that you recommended I suppose

[16:02] <ofperfection> I really appreciate you guys helping me out

[16:02] <ofperfection> I'm bouncing around between a couple perl6 books

[16:02] <ofperfection> and I'm not always able to find examples of what I'm doing wrong exactly

[18:53] <robertle> I got some weird stuff with a concurrent I/O benchmark: it sometimes works, sometimes moarvm segfaults, sometimes I get unhandled exceptions from within rakudo core code (threadpoolscheduler,lock,atomicops). not sure whether to report against moar, rakudo, or both, or neither

[18:54] <timotimo> are you sure you're using objects safely?

[18:54] <timotimo> i.e. not causing hashes or arrays to resize from one thread while another is trying to use it

[18:54] <robertle> no, not sure. let me look at it again

[18:57] <AlexDaniel> robertle: sorry, what's the situation with 2018.08 in debian? You're skipping it completely because of https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/951 or is there something else going on?

[18:57] *** marcusramberg joined
[18:57] *** hitchcock.freenode.net sets mode: +v marcusramberg

[18:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v marcusramberg

[18:58] <robertle> AlexDaniel: I was mostly thinking about 951, yes. but then again that bug isn't going to solve itself, so perhaps giving a spin in the debian porter box might shed some extra light on it

[18:58] <robertle> but I am also totally short on time :)

[18:58] <AlexDaniel> that's what I was hoping for, yes :)

[18:58] <robertle> do we have anything on that bug yet? 

[19:00] <robertle> timotimo: I do not think that I resize anything from different threads, but I guess that could easily be overlooked. I don't have much shared state between these threads though...

[19:01] <AlexDaniel> it was fine on 2018.06 and it's not ok on 2018.08, and according to the ticket you can get good/bad state by just trying to build rakudo

[19:01] <AlexDaniel> so that makes it bisectable, but very often that's not very helpful

[19:01] <robertle> timotimo: I also get the same behavior if I do RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=1, which takes most of the code out of the running-concurrently game (I think)

[19:02] <AlexDaniel> robertle: can we see your code?

[19:02] <robertle> AlexDaniel: also bisecting rakudo builds on armhf is a tedious game :)

[19:02] *** domidumont left
[19:03] <timotimo> can i get the code? :)

[19:03] <robertle> AlexDaniel: sure! it's not very nice though. backtraces and so on in https://gist.github.com/robertlemmen/5691c653b2016535e1133185f463c986 code is at https://github.com/robertlemmen/p6bench/blob/cb5ad52/03-backend

[19:03] *** chenyf_ joined
[19:04] <AlexDaniel> robertle: why is it? I understand it can be slow, but if you can build rakudo once then surely you can do it 9 extra times, no?

[19:05] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Khisanth

[19:05] <robertle> hey it's pretty much most of http client and server impl...

[19:06] <AlexDaniel> that's not much, especially given that it uses almost no modules

[19:06] <timotimo> OK, OK :)

[19:07] <robertle> the aim is to have it not use any modules

[19:07] <timotimo> using IO::Socket::Async will give you at least the event loop thread, but also the thread pool scheduler to handle tasks

[19:07] <timotimo> check RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG=yes or something like that

[19:08] *** chenyf_ left
[19:09] <robertle> right, I get the problem even with RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=1 so I was guessing it would not be between "my" main threads. I/O thread vs mine could happen of course, but I guess the libuv thread never modifies any structures I can see/use?

[19:10] <robertle> there is also a section with explicit threads towards the bottom (the clients), but they have even less shared state

[19:11] <timotimo> it still uses worker threads to handle stuff from the libuv event loop thread

[19:11] <timotimo> i see your Client is using tap instead of act

[19:12] <robertle> I thought these worker trheads would be what is limited by RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS, am I wrong there?

[19:12] <timotimo> i believe it'll add more if it detects that things are deadlocked

[19:12] <timotimo> as i said, RAKUDO_SCHEDULER_DEBUG

[19:12] <timotimo> that ought to give clarity

[19:16] <robertle> not much: first run I get "Created initial general worker thread" then one "Added a general worker thread", then my segfault

[19:16] <robertle> second run I get two "Added a general worker thread" and then the unhandled rakudo core exception

[19:16] <timotimo> OK

[19:17] <robertle> when I run with that and RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS I never get the "added", but still the bug

[19:17] <timotimo> gdb is telling me it's creating craptonnes of threads actually

[19:17] <robertle> I believe these are not the worker threads, but the ones towards the bottom of teh code, created by Thread.start explicitly

[19:18] <timotimo> oh, obviously

[19:18] <timotimo> you're right

[19:18] <robertle> but I do not see where they share anything

[19:19] <robertle> I want to replace them with tasks on the thread pool as well at some point

[19:19] <timotimo> i'm still distracted doing tpf grant work, so not looking closely enough to help terribly much

[19:20] <robertle> tpf grant for the win!

[19:21] <timotimo> :)

[19:24] <robertle> but if I convince myself that I am not sharing structures between my threads, what would be the next thing to look at?

[19:32] <AlexDaniel> maybe you can try golfing it

[19:32] <robertle> I was worried you would say that...

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> robertle: it doesn't have to be problematic, perhaps try replacing some parts with static input

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> or, if it's client/server, maybe separating these into two files?

[19:43] <timotimo> that's not a bad idea at all

[19:43] <timotimo> then the crash is contained to one or the otheŕ

[19:43] *** molaf left
[19:45] <robertle> that is a fab idea, I can easily separate them by client/server

[20:29] <timotimo> there's also a PG-only module

[20:29] <timotimo> eco: PostgreSQL

[20:29] <buggable> timotimo, Found 2 results: DB::Pg, Pg::Notify. See https://modules.perl6.org/s/PostgreSQL

[20:30] <vrurg> timotimo: Actually, this is what I'm doing. New dbh/sth per thread. It SIGSEGVs somewhere in Oracle instant client libs.

[20:30] <lindylex> AlexDaniel :  this is what I get as output >> (｢4,294,967,295｣ ｢4,294,967｣ ｢4,2｣)

[20:30] <timotimo> perhaps you're writing something like %handles<$*THREAD.id> and not realizing that won't interpolate and you're sharing one handle for all threads

[20:32] <vrurg> The biggest mistery to me is that it dies later, when all thread workers are done and I create a new dbh in the main thread. And – now, it's clearly new .connect per Thread.start

[20:32] <timotimo> oh, you're actually using Thread, interesting

[20:34] <vrurg> Yep. A Channel and a receiver per thread which actually does INSERT. Just playing with what I can get out of asynchonosity.

[20:35] <vrurg> timotimo: Ok, thanks a lot! It's not something critical for my task. Just exploring.

[20:48] <lindylex> My output should be  aa instead I get aa and b.  say "aab :: " ~~ m:global/ a+ || \w+ / ;

[20:50] *** Kaypie joined
[20:51] <timotimo> the global adverb means it'll continue trying to match after it got "aa"

[20:51] <timotimo> then b matches against \w+

[20:51] <lindylex> Thanks I get it now.

[21:29] <Kaypie> why does this throw "Cannot find method 'compile_time_value' on object of type QAST::Op" when i try to load the module? https://pastebin.com/4apUQrhs

[21:31] <timotimo> whoops! that's a good find

[21:31] <lizmat> Kaypie: didn't you mean "uri => ..." instead of "uri -> ... " ?

[21:31] <timotimo> i think normally we have to first .has_compile_time_value or nqp::can to check first

[21:31] <timotimo> maybe some new code in the optimizer isn't careful enough

[21:32] <Kaypie> ohh lol

[21:32] <lizmat> or it is simply an LTA error ?

[21:32] <timotimo> turn off the optimizer and see if it still crashes, i'd say

[21:32] <timotimo> --optimize=0 or --optimize=off

[21:32] <timotimo> (they are different)

[21:33] <lizmat> hello

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> hm, so zef will automatically install all scripts from bin/, right?

[21:33] <lizmat> "uri -> string" feels wrong to me

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> any way to prevent that? (besides renaming the directory)
