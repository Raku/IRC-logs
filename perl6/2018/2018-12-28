[00:46] <Xliff> ^^

[00:47] <vrurg> Hm, interesting approach. Thanks!

[00:47] * vrurg re-read signatures documentation. Got some information refreshed in memory...

[00:47] <Xliff> It's especially useful if, in this example, you want to do something with @a, while still having separate parameters.

[00:48] <Xliff> Like passing @a. To other subs that take the same argument, or a subset.

[00:48] <Xliff> Because you can always force @a to be passed as positionals ala |@a.

[00:49] <vrurg> This is clear. One more degree of freedom.

[00:50] <vrurg> Perl6 is beatiful.

[00:50] <Xliff> m: sub a ( *@a ($a, $b, $c, $d, $e) ) { b(|@a[2..*]) }; sub b ( *@b ($a, $b, $c) ) { say $a, $b, $c; say @b.join(',') }; a(|<1 2 3 4 5>)

[00:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5c0ac4db9: OUTPUT: «345␤3,4,5␤»

[00:50] <Xliff> vrurg: Yes! It! Is!

[00:54] * vrurg just have finished extedning the core grammar.

[00:54] <vrurg> Can't remember any other lang allowing this kind of trick.

[07:19] <jmerelo> Hi, AlexDaniel

[07:19] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[07:21] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: hello!

[07:21] <jmerelo> squashable6: status

[07:22] <squashable6> jmerelo, Next SQUASHathon in 7 days and ≈2 hours (2019-01-05 UTC-12⌁UTC+14). See https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[07:22] <jmerelo> ^^^ We should kind of get ready for this...

[07:23] <AlexDaniel> testneeded is a relatively easy topic for the bot

[07:23] <AlexDaniel> just plug roast into the bot and that's almost it

[07:23] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I was thinking more about the human side...

[07:23] <AlexDaniel> many times tests should be added to rakudo too, so rakudo repo is also in, usually

[07:24] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: re: hype and difussion and getting people to actually _know_ about it

[07:24] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: right, right :)

[07:24] <AlexDaniel> I don't do social media, so I don't know if I can help with that…

[07:24] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: (and I'm going to be on holidays and in London... )

[07:25] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Is there some landing page that people have used before for that? 

[07:25] *** kurahaupo left
[07:25] <AlexDaniel> well, there's https://twitter.com/perl6org/, I think people follow that

[07:25] *** kurahaupo joined
[07:25] <AlexDaniel> then there's facebook, reddit…

[07:26] <AlexDaniel> also p6weekly

[07:26] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I mean, some guide like the one that we wrote for unbitrot

[07:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[07:26] <AlexDaniel> weekly: Squashathon time again! Help us by writing some tests and win plush camelia! https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-Day

[07:26] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted!

[07:27] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: see what I mean? You will land people directly on the Squashathon page. They'll be lost before they find the pizza

[07:27] <AlexDaniel> I know, I understand, I agree

[07:28] <AlexDaniel> but there's no guide for testneeded squashathon

[07:28] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: That's the thing

[07:29] <AlexDaniel> maybe we need a squashathon for squashathons

[07:30] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: there's this thing: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Rakudo-SQUASHathon-Guide with a small section for testneeded. We could fork that.

[07:31] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I'm all for that

[07:31] <AlexDaniel> though right now I'm of no help… focused on something else :S

[07:32] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: here you go: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/TestNeeded-SQUASHathon-page

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> ok that's a wonderful start actually

[07:33] <AlexDaniel> “Reviewing older tickets” section should go

[07:33] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: It's a copy/paste of relevant sections of the Rakudo Squashathon page

[07:33] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: you gotcha

[07:34] <AlexDaniel> hmm that's a good start for sure

[07:34] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: actually, some things need updating. I'll check.

[16:24] <lizmat> if not, that would be the first step  :-)

[16:24] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: yes... I have several perl5 modules on CPAN

[16:24] <lizmat> it makes my life a lot easier wrt tracking updates for the P6W, as updates are tweeted

[16:24] <lizmat> then App::Mi6's "mi6 release" is your friend

[16:25] <SmokeMachine> Several means a few, right?!

[16:25] <lizmat> well, it is to me...  :-)

[16:25] <lizmat> > 1 I would say ?

[16:25] <lizmat> dictionary says "more than 2 but not many"

[17:56] <MasterDuke> Xliff: is there any convenient subset of your stuff that can be used to profile compiling? i.e., profiling a 40m build wouldn't work

[17:57] <Xliff> MasterDuke: You can pull things out of BuildList if you don't want to do it all.

[17:58] <Xliff> And I'll be doing regular compiles. If you want me to run a profile of the whole package, I don't mind. I'm doing it anyways.

[17:59] <Xliff> MasterDuke: Plus latest rakudo has brought that time way down.

[18:01] <Xliff> MasterDuke: If you prune the BuildList file at GTK::Raw::WindowGroup, I think that will make good profiling test.

[18:01] <Xliff> (So include GTK::Raw::WindowGroup and delete the rest)

[18:02] <MasterDuke> Xliff: cool, i'll give that a try

[18:03] <Xliff> MasterDuke: Unfortunately, I think the latest commits have kind of tied my projects together.

[18:05] <Xliff> MasterDuke: You should be fine on whatever you have, but 4ffb99f0c2a53126fc20eca758dbffda9e9405e8 is the last "safe" commit.

[18:05] <Xliff> At least for now.

[18:05] <MasterDuke> k, good to know

[18:05] <Xliff> I hope to release p6-Pango, soon. I still have some issues with Pango/Cairo integration that I need to solve first.

[18:06] <Xliff> Plus, I'm hoping that when I get done, timotimo can merge the PRs I've been submitting. ;)

[18:43] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: a better example https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/tORQbD3I/

[18:44] <SmokeMachine> its a fix for the first one (this is how I understood)

[18:47] <SmokeMachine> is .^ rakudo only???

[18:48] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: yes, Foo.^method is short for self.HOW.method(self)

[18:49] <lizmat> s/self/Foo

[18:49] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: yes, but is it this way on Rakudo, or on any perl6 implementation?

[18:50] <lizmat> aaah   eh... good question

[18:51] <lizmat> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/.$CIRCUMFLEX_ACCENT.html   # seems to be Perl 6, but I'm not 100% sure

[18:51] <sena_kun> o/

[18:52] <timotimo> stable in question is called Red::Column

[18:52] <timotimo> that should totally go in the original message,t oo

[18:54] <sena_kun> I am "writing" a grammar looking at some yacc/bison one in the next window, and the neat thing is that one can say "I don't mind newlines(and spaces too), please ignore it for me" in yacc/bison. Is there a way to do it neatly with Perl 6 grammar? As I have to put `\n` near every possible thing and it is kind of LTA.

[18:55] <sena_kun> yes, I know a separate lexer/parser is different from how regex engine does stuff.

[18:56] <sena_kun> One can get on with white space using `rule` instead of `token` afaik(or was it `regex` again?), but not for newlines it seems. :S

[18:57] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: yes, it should!

[19:43] <Xliff> Only thing I did was change $!author-id to $.author-id

[20:21] <Xliff> That's rakudo internal.

[20:25] <Xliff> The only other thing I can think of is that add_method doesn't specifically cover submethods, and that's why you are hitting a VMNull when you get to nextsame.
