[08:12] <scimon> Just looking.

[08:14] <rindolf> how do i pass an array ref to a subroutine?

[08:14] <scimon> xml-g-write-bash is calling write-bash with named parameters ( param-name=>$param-name etc) but wr-tebash is expecting positional parameters. 

[08:15] <scimon> Perl6 doesn't have Array Ref's it's got array objects. 

[08:15] <Xliff> \o

[08:15] <scimon> That you can just pass.

[08:15] <Xliff> What's the best way to convert a signed integer to uint8/16/32/64?

[08:15] *** dakkar joined
[08:16] <Xliff> I was doing $int +& 0xffff, but that's only good for unsigned.

[08:16] <scimon> Easiest fix for rindolf is check write-bash to have this signature : (:$param-name, :@pkgs )

[08:16] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dakkar

[08:16] <scimon> Makes the arguments named. :)

[08:16] <scimon> Not sure about the signed thing. Bit shifting isn't my forte.

[08:17] <Xliff> ($int +& 0xffff) * ($int < 0) ?? -1 !! 1

[08:17] <Xliff> Or.., maybe ($int +& 0x7fff) * ($int < 0) ?? -1 !! 1

[13:35] <timotimo> er

[13:35] <timotimo> i should be more clear

[13:35] <timotimo> subs are "my" scoped by default, so they aren't even a package thing, but totally lexical

[14:10] <sarna> hey, what does * mean in a twigil like @*foo?

[14:12] <geekosaur> normally, a dynamic variable. but in a signature it's special (dynamic variables can't occur there), means its "slurpy"

[14:13] <timotimo> well, in signatures the * actually goes in front of the sigil

[14:14] <timotimo> though saying *@ is a twigil is probably also not wrong

[14:14] <timotimo> like, an argument could be made

[15:30] <sarna> can I somehow call subs like methods so I get a nice .foo instead of foo($_) while dealing with a topic variable?

[15:31] <sena_kun>  m: sub foo($_) {.say}; 1.&foo;

[15:32] <sena_kun> It gives a warning because of an explicit declaration, but I hope I understood you correctly. :)

[15:34] <sarna> sena_kun: whoa, that's interesting. I can't name the parameter though in this case, can I?

[15:35] <sena_kun> sarna, I think you can. I just used `$_` as parameter to make code shorter. :)

[15:35] <sena_kun> m: sub foo($foo, $bar) {say $foo + $bar}; my $_ = 2; .&foo(2);

[15:35] <sena_kun> sarna, ^

[15:36] <geekosaur> bare . doesn't care about $_ so much as it wants to be method instead of sub

[15:37] <sarna> oh my!

[15:37] <sarna> thanks sena_kun <3

[15:37] <geekosaur> but it's using . / metod syntax with no invocantt hat defaults to $_, not someting abiout the sub/method

[15:47] <sarna> is there a sub like is-upper? I'm browsing the docs but can't find anything like this, only .uc

[15:47] *** robertle left
[15:47] <sena_kun> sarna, I can come up with just doing `$foo eq $foo.uc`.

[15:48] <sarna> sena_kun: well yeah, that's what I'll end up doing I think

[15:48] <sena_kun> you also can check with regex, but I believe that might be not so fast.

[17:01] <TimToady> telma: .* in a rule is almost always wrong, because rules don't backtrack by default, so the .* will always eat up the rest of the string, and never give any back

[17:02] <TimToady> you need the 'regex' keyword instead of 'rule' or 'token' if you want backtracking by default

[17:05] <TimToady> you can also put a ! or a ? on the .* to force it to backtrack right-to-left or left-to-right, but it won't by itself in either a rule or token

[17:29] <masak> TimToady: I have lots of questions, but I've currently forgotten most of them :)

[17:30] <masak> TimToady: here's one: do you think of concatenation in regexes as a "zero-width infix operator"?

[18:07] <TimToady> masak: not really; regexes just naturally match a bunch of things in a row, so it's more like an iterable recursive function

[18:07] <TimToady> so more like "foo bar baz 42" only written the other way around

[18:10] <TimToady> I tend to think of the prototypical infix as a symmetrical operation, but the terms in / a b / are more hierarchical

[18:12] <TimToady> of course, not all our infixes are entirely symmetrical...

[19:22] <robertle> I am mucking around with another benchmark to compare perl 6 performance, the aim being that the tests would be closer to what I want to run and more full-sized rather than synthetic (https://github.com/robertlemmen/p6bench). But I am having weird issues with older versions of rakudo. for example 2017.05 (with matching nqp and moar) fails with

[19:22] <robertle> /usr/bin/moar --libpath="/usr/share/nqp/lib" --libpath="/usr/share/nqp/lib" perl6.moarvm --nqp-lib=blib --setting=NULL --ll-exception --optimize=3 --target=mbc --stagestats --output=CORE.setting.moarvm gen/moar/CORE.setting

[19:22] <robertle> Unhandled exception: Failed to write string to stream: broken pipe

[19:22] <robertle>    at gen/moar/stage2/NQPHLL.nqp:1713  (/usr/share/nqp/lib/NQPHLL.moarvm:command_eval)

[19:23] <robertle> which is odd, I am sure that I did manage to build rakudo versions early last year. also when I did have build problems in the past, the error messages were far more helpful

[19:24] <robertle> has anyone seen stuff like this before? or any ideas? Is my asumption that matched versions of rakudo/nqp/moar should work together incorrect? is it possible they don't build anymore beacuse other stuff on my computer (e.g. libuv or so) is too recent?

[19:25] <robertle> clarification for the above, it's the rakudo build that fails of course

[19:25] <lizmat> robertle: if you're not using the libuv that comes with that version of MoarVM, that feels like a recipe for disaster

[19:26] <lizmat> as I think Moar has been adapted to match subtle changes in libuv more than once

[20:27] <lizmat> bazzaar: you're using Slang::Tuxic, which implies you may need parens in some places ?

[20:28] <lizmat> specifically the "$contents.lines" may need "($contents.lines)"

[20:32] <bazzaar> lizmat: the code also worked with 'for $contents.lines[^5] -> Str $line {' ..... I remember

[20:35] <lizmat> if not, I suggest you remove it

[20:35] <lizmat> it will at least make your script compile a lot faster

[22:34] <timotimo> o/

[22:35] <Herby_> timotimo: how goes it?

[22:37] <timotimo> all right. i finally got back to playing with cellular automata. but my wrists are getting worse since yesterday :|

[22:37] <timotimo> how's you?

[22:38] <Herby_> cellular automata? Can't say I'm too familiar with that

[22:39] <Herby_> and I'm doing well, just got off work, drinking coffee, and trying my hand at programming exercises

[22:39] <timotimo> sounds like a chill time

[22:39] <Herby_> I can't complain :)

[22:40] <Herby_> whats happening with your wrists? rsi?

[22:42] *** huf joined
[22:42] <timotimo> yeah

[22:42] <Herby_> bummer :(

[22:42] <timotimo> it really is :\

[22:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v huf

[22:42] <timotimo> want a short primer on cellular automata?

[22:43] <Herby_> I'm always up for learning

[22:44] *** mcmillhj joined
[22:44] <timotimo> OK, so the most general definition is this: you have some kind of grid with individual cells. every cell can have one of N different states - think colors or numbers or animals

[22:44] <timotimo> (that's not all of it!)

[22:45] <timotimo> (just as much as fits into one line)

[22:45] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[22:45] <timotimo> so, the whole system makes "steps", where every cell is looked at, along with its "neighborhood" - for example "the cells north, east, south, and west of it on a chess board

[22:46] <timotimo> and depending only on the states of the cell itself and the cells in its neighborhood, does the cell change its own state

[22:46] <timotimo> and things like what states can exist, and what the neighborhood is, and what the rules for changing state are, that's the same for every cell

[22:47] <timotimo> that's the basic case for cellular automata. Game of Life is probably the most famous one

[22:47] <timotimo> in game of life, the neighborhood is north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest

[22:48] <timotimo> and the rules are expressed as "if the cell is 'alive' and there are between X and Y cells nearby, it dies (starvation/suffocation), otherwise it stays alive"

[22:48] <timotimo> "there are between X and Y 'alive' cells nearby"

[22:49] *** mcmillhj left
[22:49] <timotimo> "if the cell is 'dead' and there are between F and G alive cells nearby, the cell becomes alive (reproduction/splitting/growth), otherwise it stays dead"

[22:49] <timotimo> i don't know the "default" numbers by heart, but there are variants with different values anyway

[22:51] <Herby_> ok. I've often heard of the Game of Life but I never really understood what it was about. this helps

[22:51] <timotimo> cool :)

[22:52] <timotimo> game of life is an example of CAs with "simple" rules that can execute arbitrary calculations

[22:52] <timotimo> in fact, there is a method to build a game of life simulator out of configurations of cells inside a game of life world

[22:54] <Herby_> sounds like inception.

[22:54] <Herby_> What are you currently exploring with CA right now?

[22:55] <timotimo> the ones i have right now are on a regular 2d grid with NESW neighborhood and just two states, but every cell has a random chance in every step to just do nothing

[22:55] <timotimo> that chance is at 5% right now, but sometimes i change it on a whim

[22:56] <timotimo> https://mastodon.social/@timotimo/100674655508783180 - i've made a thread on mastodon with a few example videos

[22:57] <Herby_> those are awesome. is the code posted anywhere?

[22:57] <timotimo> not yet, still working on it :)

[22:58] <timotimo> i just made it 40% faster by removing an "int8" from one variable %)

[23:00] <Herby_> i love optimizing things, even with my very limited programming skillset

[23:00] <Herby_> speaking of making things faster, could you eyeball my code for this puzzle to see if there are any easy wins to speed it up?

[23:00] <Herby_> https://gist.github.com/sylints/df1c8e2619e57a0168882009d7668c09

[23:00] <Herby_> puzzle is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/98ufvz/20180820_challenge_366_easy_word_funnel_1/

[23:01] <Herby_> The goal for Optional Bonus 2 is to have it run within 1 to 2 seconds. I'm currently sitting at 10 seconds

[23:01] <Herby_> but the result is correct

[23:01] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:02] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[23:02] <timotimo> since $word doesn't change in that loop inside funnel-bonus, you could move $word.chars out of the "while" statement

[23:02] <timotimo> that'd be a miniscule win at best

[23:02] <timotimo> substr is a bit faster if you use the form without Ranges, even though it looks less beautiful

[23:03] *** sotona joined
[23:03] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v sotona

[23:03] <timotimo> sometimes using .IO.slurp.lines is faster than .IO.lines

[23:04] <timotimo> oh, and you're reading the file in twice, perhaps read the words list once, and create the Set from that afterwards

[23:05] <timotimo> it's possible that making $index and $counter native ints, i.e. "my int $counter", though with a bit of bad luck it'll end up slower

[23:06] *** mcmillhj left
[23:06] <timotimo> you could use my %w := funnel-bonus, which is probably faster, since it doesn't copy the hash that was created inside funnel-bonus

[23:06] <timotimo> i.e. binding := instead of assignment =

[23:07] <timotimo> let me know how it goes!

[23:07] <Herby_> thanks for the feedback! i'll tweak the code and let you know how the timing changes

[23:08] <Herby_> probably the root cause of the run time is my poor choice of algorithm

[23:09] *** dominix joined
[23:10] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v dominix

[23:13] <timotimo> not enough focus to look much at the algorithm and such

[23:21] *** mcmillhj left
[23:23] <MasterDuke> Herby_: you check if %words.elems > 4 in funnel-bonus and in the mainline

[23:24] <MasterDuke> might be able to change to something like `if my %w = funnel-bonus($line, $word_set) { $counter++; say "bonus('$line') => " ~ %w.keys; }`

[23:25] <timotimo> or just if funnel-bonus($line, $word_set) -> %w { ... }

[23:26] <Herby_> MasterDuke: doh! nice catch

[23:30] *** [particle] joined

[23:32] <timotimo> Herby_: "return" at the end of a sub is a little slower than just putting the result value there

[23:33] <vrurg> Can somebody have an idea on how to get around this bug: https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130794 ?

[23:33] <vrurg> s/have/give/

[23:34] *** mcmillhj joined
[23:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[23:35] <timotimo> yes, you can make an inner lexical scope to do the "use" in, and return what you wanted from it into a constant, for example with a do block

[23:36] <timotimo> m: class is::all::right { }; constant OtherNamespace = do { use Test; Test }; OtherNamespace::is "me", "me", "yay"

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 07089e89e: OUTPUT: «Could not find symbol '&is'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:37] <timotimo> m: class is::all::right { }; constant &is = do { use Test; &is }; OtherNamespace::is "me", "me", "yay"

[23:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 07089e89e: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - yay␤»

[23:37] <timotimo> wait what

[23:37] <timotimo> that's very wrong %)

[23:37] <timotimo> m: class is::all::right { }; constant &namespaced-is = do { use Test; &is }; namespaced-is "me", "me", "yay"

[23:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 07089e89e: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - yay␤»

[23:37] <timotimo> m: class is::all::right { }; constant &namespaced-is = do { use Test; &is }; namespaced-is "me", "me", "yay"; say is.WHAT

[23:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 07089e89e: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - yay␤(is)␤»

[23:38] <timotimo> m: class is::all::right { }; constant &namespaced-is = do { use Test; &is }; namespaced-is "me", "me", "yay"; say is.^name

[23:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 07089e89e: OUTPUT: «ok 1 - yay␤Perl6::Metamodel::PackageHOW␤»

[23:38] <timotimo> is that helpful at all? the example isn't quite 1:1 because it's a sub that i'm importing, not apackage

[23:38] <timotimo> oh ... also "is" as a sub wouldn't conflict with "&is" anyway

[23:40] <timotimo> i don't get that error locally

[23:46] <vrurg> timotimo: Thanks! But it turns out that there is a better solution for my task. I didn't know that a method could be run on a role itself without applying it to a class.

[23:46] <timotimo> ah, yes indeed

[23:46] <vrurg> But your examples are very interesting from the syntax point of view. Another thing I've just learned. :)

[23:46] <timotimo> it'll act as if you had an empty class to compose it into

[23:46] <timotimo> that's called "punning"

[23:58] <timotimo> nice!

[23:58] <Herby_> using substr() instead of $word.substr() had the biggest impact by far

[23:58] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[23:59] <Herby_> using that binding idea you mentioned gave me this error: Type check failed in binding; expected Associative but got Slip (Empty)

[23:59] <Herby_> but > 50% reduction in runtime is awesome, thanks
