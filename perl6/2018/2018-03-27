[07:58] <lizmat> when smartmatches its parameter with $_

[07:58] <lizmat> so it smartmatches True / False with the Buf

[07:58] <lizmat> which is always false

[07:58] <lizmat> so you were using "when" incorrectly

[07:58] <lizmat> m: given 42 { .say }

[07:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 24ddff73b: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[07:58] <lizmat> 'given' is basically just a topicalizer

[07:58] <lizmat> m: $_ = 42; when 42 { say "whee" }   # you don't need 'given' to be able to do a 'when'

[07:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 24ddff73b: OUTPUT: «whee␤»

[08:00] <donpdonp> im so confused

[08:00] <donpdonp> even if i try to fall back to if, its not intuitive

[08:01] <donpdonp> m: if Buf.new(1,2,3) cmp Buf.new(1,2,3)  { say "Z" }

[08:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 24ddff73b: OUTPUT: «Z␤»

[08:02] <lizmat> donpdonp: cmp returns either Less / Same / More

[08:02] <lizmat> only the Less / More cases are True in boolean context

[08:02] <donpdonp> oO

[08:02] <donpdonp> o^O

[08:02] <lizmat> Same is False as a Boolean

[08:02] <lizmat> Numerically they are -1, 0, 1

[08:02] <donpdonp> ohhh

[08:03] <donpdonp> m: if Buf.new(1,2,3) cmp Buf.new(1,2,3)  == Same { say "same" }

[08:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 24ddff73b: OUTPUT: «same␤»

[08:03] <lizmat> but I think you've actually found a bug in Buf ~~ Buf

[08:03] <lizmat> I think that should be True

[08:04] <lizmat> am checking with core devs to see whether that is a bug or not

[08:04] <lizmat> I intended the "cmp" suggestion as a temporary workaround

[17:59] <mr_ron> Don't understand 'False' mismatch results ...

[18:06] <timotimo> i think i know why it shows that it matched the token backwards

[18:07] <timotimo> that's actually how <after> is implemented; it flips both the target string and the rule around so it can use the regular forwards parsing code

[18:07] <timotimo> that way you can have variable-width lookbehind

[18:08] <mr_ron> how come it matches for the token but not for the literal?

[18:08] <mr_ron> oh - it flips the rule

[18:09] <mr_ron> not clear it is doing the right thing in all cases here though

[18:09] <timotimo> oh

[18:10] <timotimo> it's correct that it's matching "or" because that's in the source string

[18:10] <timotimo> because it's <!after>, right?

[18:10] *** natrys joined
[18:11] <mr_ron> it's matching 'ro' not 'or' ... I think

[18:12] <timotimo> hm, ok, it's not the negation, it's the flipping

[18:13] <mr_ron> should the token and the literal give different results?

[18:13] <AlexDaniel> RT#131964 is related I think

[18:13] <mr_ron> I noticed the RT but wasn't sure it was the same problem ... will check again

[18:14] <AlexDaniel> it's a different problem, but a bit similar

[18:14] <timotimo> hm, so maybe we flip the order of things in the regex but we also need to exchange a few pairs?

[21:12] <[Coke]> do you have sqllite installed?

[21:12] *** kurahaupo left
[21:12] <Bowlslaw> yes

[21:12] <[Coke]> (the binary/dev package)

[21:13] <Bowlslaw> I tested it with basic statements and it works fine

[21:13] *** kurahaupo joined
[21:13] <Bowlslaw> yes i have libsqlite3-dev installed

[21:14] <timotimo> that's not the problem here

[21:14] *** mcmillhj left
[21:14] <timotimo> looks like DBIish just doesn't support directly binding Date objects into a statement

[21:15] <Bowlslaw> hmm

[21:15] <timotimo> so maybe stringify it first or something; not sure how sqlite likes it

[21:15] *** itaipu joined
[21:15] <Bowlslaw> ok so I will try something like, my $date = date.new(now), and then using the $date var 

[21:16] <timotimo> it seems like you've already got a date object and dbiish doesn't like it, though?

[21:17] *** skids left
[21:17] <[Coke]> that'd still be a Date.

[21:17] <Bowlslaw> what do you mean?

[21:17] <Bowlslaw> oh

[21:18] <Bowlslaw> it can't be a Date object at all?

[21:18] <Bowlslaw> hmm

[21:18] <[Coke]> Seems like that's a reasonable feature request for DBIsh, but in the meantime, you might be able to use a string like timotimo suggests (but you'll probably have to format it yourself to get the right format)

[21:19] <Bowlslaw> ok, thanks

[21:21] <Bowlslaw> yeah it's the date object

[21:21] <timotimo> if you're interested in the internals, here's a few lines for you to look at: https://github.com/perl6/DBIish/blob/master/lib/DBDish/SQLite/Native.pm6#L113-L137

[21:22] <timotimo> https://sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html - this is the official sqlite c interface docs, they don't seem to have anything in particular for Date

[21:22] <Bowlslaw> hmmm

[21:22] <Bowlslaw> maybe the timestamp type is what they use

[21:23] <[Coke]> timotimo: wonder if it would make sense to wrap it and have DBIish pick a "sane" format as a default and then save it as a string. 

[21:23] <timotimo> yeah, that'd surely be possible

[21:23] <[Coke]> (but then yah, do you want timestamp, ISO dates...)

[21:23] *** mcmillhj joined
[21:23] <timotimo> the first stackoverflow find suggests you can just use unix timestamps

[21:23] <timotimo> and bind them as 64 bit integers

[21:24] <Bowlslaw> I want it to be in YYY-MM-DD so I can easily select purchases between certain dates

[21:24] <Bowlslaw> YYYY*

[21:25] <timotimo> this is only about the internal format, you can still use datetime functions in SQL syntax as you are used to

[22:06] <AlexDaniel> perlawhirl: basically, bisectable only checks 2015.12 and HEAD, but it's a 2-year range now

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> further we go, more functionality tends to flap back and forth… and checking just 2015.12 and HEAD is becoming less meaningful :(
