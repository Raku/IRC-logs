[00:04] <AlexDaniel> yeah probably… hm I think I'm having some sort of issue when there's only one element on one of the sides

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> whatever

[00:06] <benjikun> Yeah probably eqv

[00:09] <AlexDaniel> `(@a cmp @b) == Same` works better for some reason… whatever, it's a throwaway script

[02:23] <Aearnus> hey all! i just started with perl6 & i've got a question. is it possible to refer to the parent class of a method from the type signature?

[02:23] <squashable6> 🍕 AlexDaniel++ wrote a comment on “Selenium::WebDriver”: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/67#issuecomment-410415944

[02:24] <Aearnus> i'm trying to do something like `role A { method foo(&a) { ... } }` where foo only takes a callable that produces an A

[02:25] <Aearnus> or, not a callable that produces an A, i meant to say a callable that produces the class that implements the A role

[02:27] <AlexDaniel> it doesn't sound like this answers your question, but:

[02:27] <AlexDaniel> m: role A { method foo(&a where .returns ~~ A) { say 42 } }; A.new.foo( sub (--> A) { A.new }

[02:28] <AlexDaniel> Aearnus: ↑ does this help?

[02:28] *** xi- left
[02:28] <Aearnus> AlexDaniel: i want to restrict the function signature to the specific class that implements A (i'm writing a Monad role)

[02:29] <Aearnus> so any specific Monad isn't able to return a different Monad 

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> aaah

[02:29] <AlexDaniel> ok now I understand the question :)

[02:30] <AlexDaniel> I don't know the answer though…

[02:33] <Aearnus> it's okay :) thank you though

[02:34] <Aearnus> i could check it at runtime by just defining two separate methods (one of which doesn't get overloaded by the classes) but that would defeat the purpose of using the type system imo

[02:36] <AlexDaniel> Aearnus: it would be checked at runtime anyway, at least with the current implementation

[02:37] <Aearnus> either way, defining two separate methods seems like an unelegant solution

[02:37] <Aearnus> wait, could i check `.WHAT` in the `where` clause of the function signature?

[02:37] <AlexDaniel> yes, but better check .^name

[02:37] <Aearnus> (what's the ^ sign before name for?)

[02:39] <AlexDaniel> Aearnus: I can't phrase it better than this: https://docs.perl6.org/language/classtut#index-entry-^methods

[02:39] <AlexDaniel> basically .^ is for introspection

[02:39] *** xi- joined
[02:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v xi-

[02:40] <Aearnus> ah, so `.^` calls the function on the class that the object uses. cool

[03:33] <Aearnus> I found some possibly unintentional behavior though: when you're defining a class, if you have to use the class name in a type parameter, it will only work in an `also` clause

[03:33] <Aearnus> ex: `class Foo does Monad[Foo] { }` doesn't work while `class Foo { also does Monad[Foo] }` works

[06:24] *** domidumont left
[06:40] <xinming> m: sub t (:$a!, :$b!, :$c!) { ($a, $b, $c).perl.say }; my %h = (:a(1), :b(2), :d(5)); t (%h<a b>), :c(4)

[06:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 0 arguments but got 1␤  in sub t at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[06:40] <xinming> in this case, How do we use use extracted hash slice pairs to pass to function?

[06:41] <tyil> m: sub t (:$a!, :$b!, :$c!) { ($a, $b, $c).perl.say }; my %h = (:a(1), :b(2), :d(5)); t (|%h<a b>), :c(4)

[06:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: OUTPUT: «Too many positionals passed; expected 0 arguments but got 1␤  in sub t at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[06:41] <tyil> hmm

[06:42] <xinming> I've been trying this for an hour at least. :-)

[06:43] <tyil> %h<a b> retuns (1, 2), not (:a(1), :b(2))

[06:43] <tyil> doesnt it?

[06:43] <tyil> so it gets called as t(1, 2, c(4))

[06:44] <tyil> :c(4) *

[06:44] <benjikun> That's correct tyil

[06:44] <tyil> not sure if there's a shorthand to retrieve those hash elements with their keys

[06:44] <benjikun> m: my %h = a => 1, b => 2; say %h<a b>;

[06:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar e0a27ce37: OUTPUT: «(1 2)␤»

[06:44] <xinming> %h<a b>:p

[06:44] <benjikun> ^^^

[06:45] <xinming> m: sub t (:$a!, :$b!, :$c!) { ($a, $b, $c).perl.say }; my %h = :a(1), :b(2), :d(5); t %h<a b>:p), :c(4)

[06:45] <xinming> This doesn't work either

[06:48] <tyil> I don't think I know a solution for you then, and I have to go for now

[06:48] <tyil> sorry xinming 

[06:49] <xinming> THanks for your time anyway. :-)

[07:38] <andrzejek> give me admin I will punish them

[07:38] <Aearnus> is there a way to automatically convert a function that takes a bunch of arguments into a function that takes a list of said arguments?

[07:39] <Aearnus> `my @grid = ((-2, -1.9 ... 2) X (-2, -1.9 ... 2))».(Complex.new)` i want to do something like this (but obviously this specific bit of code doesn't work)

[07:51] <CIAvash> m: my @grid = ((-2, -1.9 ... 2) X (-2, -1.9 ... 2)).map: { Complex.new: |$_ }; say @grid[^5]

[07:55] <Aearnus> why doesn't `my @grid = ((-2, -1.9 ... 2) X (-2, -1.9 ... 2))».{Complex.new(|$_)}` work?

[08:06] <CIAvash> Aearnus: I think that should be ».&{Complex.new(|$_)}, but here » doesn't work like map. It goes deeper and operates on each element seprately. read the part about nodality: https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#index-entry-hyper_%3C%3C-hyper_%3E%3E-hyper_%C2%AB-hyper_%C2%BB-Hyper_operators

[08:06] <CIAvash> https://docs.perl6.org/language/typesystem#trait_is_nodal

[08:08] <Aearnus> that's annoying

[08:09] <Aearnus> fwiw ».&{Complex.new(|$_)} descends into the nested list (and shoots back an error `Cannot resolve caller new(Complex: Int); none of these signatures match`)

[08:10] <Aearnus> but without using the `&` it shoots back the same error complaining about `new(Complex: Any)`

[08:11] <Aearnus> so it must not be descending into those inner lists if it's not giving me the same error  :I

[08:13] *** fk_ left
[08:14] <CIAvash> it runs inside the {} once, it's trying to access $_ but it's not set

[09:40] <Xliff> \o

[09:40] <Xliff> Has anyone discussed the possibility of writing a native dependency for META6?

[09:43] <Xliff> I did get something from from ugexe: https://gist.github.com/ugexe/b0660c937268ff76cc0015215ecf578d

[09:43] <sena_kun> you mean implementation-wise or just specs in META file?

[09:43] <Xliff> Specs and an implementation to test that assertion.

[09:44] <sena_kun> it looks nice, but we(me and AlexDaniel) decided it'd be a stretch goal if unbitrot repo will achieve 0 issues, otherwise maybe some other time to volunteer so.

[09:44] <Xliff> However, there are some modules that will build its own copy of the lib. Wouldnt' that imply a way to add a provision to "provides"?

[09:44] <Xliff> sena_kun: No worries. I do realize that a goal is a goal, but sometimes a subgoal is necessary.

[09:45] <Xliff> I've run into at least one Module that has this exact issue.

[09:45] <sena_kun> what kind of issue? Missing native dependency or?

[09:45] <Xliff> Algorithm::LBFGS was the one that stands out.

[09:45] <Xliff> Missing native dependency, but it builds its own copy and passes travis-ci. However when I went to install it, it failed, which is why it was listed.

[09:46] <Xliff> I sent in a PR, but this is what the maintainer said: "Works for me, since it works for travis-ci."

[09:47] <Xliff> My module also worked on travis-ci, and it was listed. And properly so.

[09:47] <Xliff> Said module being Audio::OggVorbis

[09:47] <sena_kun> the thing is that (right now) this mechanism(natives in meta) doesn't really install stuff, just checks it and gives a better error. but error is error anyway, while our goal is to check a lot(really _a lot_) of modules.

[09:48] <Xliff> Yes. And I will adjust my module to account for what ugexe suggested. I am about to commit that fix, now. Hence me raising this discussion.

[09:48] <sena_kun> I agree that it is a great feature, but I am not sure that this particular squashhathon is meant for it.

[09:48] <Xliff> Fair enough.

[09:48] <Xliff> Thanks for taking the time.

[09:48] <sena_kun> np

[09:48] <lizmat> .

[09:49] <sena_kun> of course, it is just my humble opinion, you know. If you want, you surely can send PRs to people with updated META and I cannot prohibit it by any means. :)

[15:09] <Kaiepi> the Compress::Snappy issue reminds me i should add install instructions to Net::LibIDN and Net::LibIDN2

[15:09] <lizmat> you don't need to: you can use the [email@hidden.address] as email address

[15:10] <Xliff> OK, thanks.

[15:11] <Kaiepi> what's the name of the third-party package manager on mac?

[15:12] <Kaiepi> oh homebrew

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: only on CPAN → send an email, tag with “issue sent”

[15:13] <Xliff> AlexDaniel++: Currently in progress.

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: author no longer maintaining the module → still send a PR if you can, why not :)

[15:13] <Xliff> Can't do a PR if it is not on Github

[15:13] <Xliff> Otherwise I wouldn't be asking. ;)

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> that's for the MadcapJake thingie

[15:14] <Xliff> No. FindBin

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> 's :)

[15:14] <Kaiepi> does homebrew require root to install packages?

[15:17] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: In this situation, do I close the issue or leave it open? I have closed it, but can reopen.

[15:17] <Xliff> I have made an offer to attempt to fix.

[15:17] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: close it, that's as much as we can do for the module

[15:17] <Xliff> Thanks.

[15:17] <AlexDaniel> I mean, you can also send a .patch file, but… eh…

[15:18] <Xliff> I have a copy of the source. I will wait until I get a response... 

[15:18] <AlexDaniel> we can later come back to “issue sent” tickets and do PRs for them, if there's time

[16:34] <sumandoc> This is sum_c function in C that I want to run from Perl 6 with Nativecall. It basically calculates the sum of an array. https://pastebin.com/q63fHKgj

[16:35] <sumandoc> I wrote perl 6 code also to do that but how to run the function in perl 6 https://pastebin.com/nrRs6sRG

[16:37] <timotimo> you'll have to use CArray for this purpose, or buf, or "my int @foo"

[16:37] <timotimo> actually

[16:37] <timotimo> must be int32

[16:37] <Kaiepi> make it sub sum(Pointer[int32]) is native('./libsum.so') {*}

[16:38] <Kaiepi> wait what's your c code trying to do?

[16:38] <timotimo> it uses the first element as the array size

[16:38] <timotimo> and as return value also?

[16:38] <timotimo> oh!

[16:38] <timotimo> i was very wrong

[16:38] <timotimo> it's meant to add values from 0 through the number in x

[16:39] <timotimo> i wouldn't call that "the sum of an array", though

[16:39] <sumandoc> Kaiepi trying to find sum of an array

[16:40] *** xi- joined
[16:40] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v xi-

[16:40] <Kaiepi> i'd do it like this https://pastebin.com/6fBiMWh5

[16:42] <Kaiepi> the code you had would loop up until whatever the first number in the array was

[16:42] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; }; try { my $a = A.new; CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; 

[16:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; };7⏏5<EOL>␤»

[16:42] <Kaiepi> and if it were large enough it could segfault

[16:42] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; }; try { my $a = A.new; CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; }; 

[16:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: OUTPUT: «HI!␤»

[16:42] <timotimo> Kaiepi: i don't think it would do that

[16:43] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; }; try { my $a = A.new(a => 2); CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; }; 

[16:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: OUTPUT: «HI!␤»

[16:43] <Kaiepi> no?

[16:43] <timotimo> you see, i isn't a pointer, nor being dereferenced

[16:43] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; }; try { my $a = A.new(:!a(2)); CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; }; 

[16:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Argument not allowed on negated pair with key 'a'␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3is required; }; try { my $a = A.new(:!a(7⏏052)); CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required␤»

[16:43] <timotimo> so all it does is count up and add up the numbers it goes through from 0 to n

[16:43] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; submethod BUILD(:$!a) {}; }; try { my $a = A.new(:a(2)); CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; };

[16:44] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; submethod BUILD(:$!a) {}; }; try { my $a = A.new; CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; }; 

[16:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: ( no output )

[16:44] <Kaiepi> oh

[16:44] <timotimo> m: class A { has $!a is required; submethod TWEAK(:$!a) {}; }; try { my $a = A.new; CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; };

[16:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: OUTPUT: «HI!␤»

[16:44] <Xliff> ^^ What am I doing wrong, here

[16:44] <timotimo> submethod BUILD opts you out of most features of object creation

[16:44] <timotimo> including "is required"

[16:44] <timotimo> and default values

[16:45] <timotimo> TWEAK was introduced for that reason

[16:45] <timotimo> BBL

[16:46] <Xliff> ^^ Still getting exception, tho

[16:46] <lizmat> Xliff: you can't set private attributes with the standard ".new"

[16:46] <lizmat> for that, they have to be public

[16:46] <Xliff> So privates have to be set by BUILD, then?

[16:47] <Xliff> s/privates/requireds/

[16:47] <Xliff> m: class A { has $!a is required; submethod BUILD(:$a) { $!a = $a }; }; try { my $a = A.new(:a(2)); CATCH { when X::Attribute::Required { say "HI!" }; }; };

[16:50] <Kaiepi> what's the error?

[16:50] <Kaiepi> sumandoc, 

[16:50] <lizmat> ah, I guess they're checked after BUILD, and before TWEAK

[16:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 6ad50d794: ( no output )

[16:51] <sumandoc> I was thinking if I could do this

[16:51] <sumandoc> use NativeCall; sub sum_c(Pointer[int32]) is native('duo') { * };   sum_c(9)

[16:51] <Xliff> sumandoc: That's not a pointer.

[16:52] <lizmat> Xliff: yeah, that's why I thought making it an error, was a good thing

[16:52] <lizmat> but it broke too much in the ecosystem

[16:52] <Xliff> OK. There's a module that uses "is required" but it isn't functioning right.

[16:52] <Xliff> I will raise an issue.

[20:33] <Kaiepi> can you throw exceptions in a pure method?

[20:34] <timotimo> yes

[20:34] <timotimo> you can do whatever you like in a pure method or sub

[20:34] <timotimo> note, however, that the optimizer is very unlikely to actually do anything with a pure method, given how late-bound method calls are

[20:35] <timotimo> and the exception will be caught by the compiler

[20:36] <Kaiepi> thanks

[20:37] <Kaiepi> i think i'll try to make whichever methods/subs i can get away with pure to help force myself to write code i can actually unit test

[21:43] <Xliff> :P

[21:43] <Xliff> OK, if we have a distro dependent library issue for ecosystem-unbitrot, how should that be handled?

[21:43] <masak> is there a serial version of &all ?

[21:43] <Xliff> I am writing an issue to the maintainer, but...

[21:43] <Xliff> .seen FROGGS

[21:43] <yoleaux> I saw FROGGS 28 Jul 2018 11:59Z in #perl6: <FROGGS> though that'd mean that if something was not present at compile time, it wont be used if it get installed later on

[21:43] <Xliff> \o/

[21:44] <Xliff> OK. No worries, then.

[21:44] <masak> what I would like is for something that (a) traverses a list of values, (b) applies a predicate to them each in turn, (c) returns True if it gets through them all, or the first falsy value if it doesn't, (d) (crucially) doesn't progress beyond the first falsy value

[21:45] <AlexDaniel> masak: .map and [&&] ?

[21:45] <masak> JS calls this `Array.prototype.every` -- is there a similar thing in Perl 6?

[21:46] <masak> AlexDaniel: I thought [&&] deliberately didn't short-circuit

[21:46] <masak> I thought none of the reduce metaops did

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> well, that's news to me… is it documented? :)

[22:20] <Xliff> ^^ Looks like a short circuit to me.

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: good, yes, now with an array :)

[22:20] <Xliff> m: ([&&](do { say 2; 2 < 5 }, do { say 3; 3 < 5 }, do { say 8; 8 < 5 }, do { say 1; 1 < 5 }).Array).say

[22:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar c4bb1b19d: OUTPUT: «2␤3␤8␤[False]␤»

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> I mean, with array as your input :)

[22:21] <Xliff> LOL

[22:22] <Xliff> m: sub a($x) { say $x; $x < 5 }; say [&&] lazy <2 3 8 1>.map(do &a)

[22:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar c4bb1b19d: OUTPUT: «2␤3␤8␤1␤False␤»

[22:22] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: The problem to me is that you still have a sub defined by map

[22:22] <Xliff> Which will cause all elements to be eval'd.

[22:23] <Xliff> m: sub a($x) { say $x; $x < 5 }; say [&&] lazy <2 3 8 1>.map(a(*))

[22:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar c4bb1b19d: OUTPUT: «*␤Cannot resolve caller Real(Whatever: ); none of these signatures match:␤    (Mu:U \v: *%_)␤  in sub a at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar c4bb1b19d: OUTPUT: «2␤3␤8␤1␤False␤»

[22:24] <Xliff> There is still an anon sub, so && sees something defined, even though the sub evaluates to false.

[22:24] <Xliff> m: sub a($x) { say $x; $x < 5 }; say [&&] lazy <2 3 8 1>.grep( a(*) )

[22:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar c4bb1b19d: OUTPUT: «*␤Cannot resolve caller Real(Whatever: ); none of these signatures match:␤    (Mu:U \v: *%_)␤  in sub a at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:25] <Xliff> m: sub a($x) { say $x; $x < 5 }; say [&&] lazy <2 3 8 1>.map(&a).grep

[22:26] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: It's not that I DON'T see your point, it's just that I don't know the best way to write it without a definition that && will NOT assume is true.

[22:30] <AlexDaniel> masak: sorry I get a bit emotional when behavior changes without tests :)

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> at least I can't find any

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> and I can also tell just by looking at the commit, heh
