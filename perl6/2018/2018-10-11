[10:40] <MitarashiDango[m> I stumbled upon some weirdness with &?ROUTINE and &?BLOCK when using control flow in a subroutine. If I use loop in a sub, &?ROUTINE should refer to the sub, shouldn't it? Because &?BLOCK does instead

[10:41] <MitarashiDango[m> But inside a for block &?ROUTINE does in fact refer to the sub

[10:41] <masak> m: sub foo { say &?ROUTINE }

[10:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 8cc3d5d7d: ( no output )

[11:18] <erana> It's based on distributions in a population, so it should not become a general statisticsc package such as Math::Statistics SFY later on

[11:18] <erana> so it can use evolution with genetic algorithms and more

[11:20] <erana> It's not multi-variate however

[11:21] <erana> but you have variance, expectance, covariance, correlation, very small as I said

[12:57] <scovit> where my regex float { <[+-]>?\d*'.'\d+[e<[+-]>?\d+]? }

[12:58] <scovit> it is very simple, but results in quite a complex $/ object

[12:58] <scovit> how do I get to the matched (<float>)s ?

[12:58] <moritz> first, remove the ()

[12:58] <moritz> <float> already captures

[12:59] <scovit> didn't know that, ok

[12:59] <moritz> and then just iterate: for $<float> -> $f { ... }

[12:59] <jnthn> That's probably why it looked complex :-)

[12:59] <moritz> I might be biased, but I'd recommend https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1484232275/ :-)

[13:00] <masak> moritz++ # biased in exactly the right way

[13:02] <scovit> moritz, great, your for cycle works!

[13:03] <scovit> is there a more sugarish way to take $<float> and get an array of strings out of it?

[13:03] <moritz> $<float>¬ª.Str

[13:03] <evalable6> moritz, rakudo-moar 8cc3d5d7d: OUTPUT: ¬´Use of Nil in string context‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/0oUT9zW2UZ line 1‚ê§¬ª

[13:04] <moritz> or even ~¬´$<float>, but I'd consider that exaggerated

[13:05] <scovit> mortiz it works!

[13:05] <scovit> I cannot get the non-unicode version to work tough

[13:05] <scovit> the Texas version

[13:05] <jnthn> ~<<$<float>

[13:06] <moritz> it's just ugly

[13:06] <jnthn> Actually with the texas version I prefer the prefix ~ 'cus then you don't have two different kinds of > against each other :)

[13:06] <scovit> yep I will avoid the ugly one :)

[19:21] <bobbyJim> Working thru brian's Learning Perl6.  I'm finding Perl6 to feel quite natural so far.

[19:22] <moritz> that's good to hear :-)

[19:22] <buggable> New CPAN upload: Sparrowdo-VSTS-YAML-Angular-Build-0.0.5.tar.gz by MELEZHIK https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/M/ME/MELEZHIK/Perl6/Sparrowdo-VSTS-YAML-Angular-Build-0.0.5.tar.gz

[19:23] <bobbyJim> Is there a forum for brainstorming about Perl6? Uses, targets, applications, conquer-the-world matters?

[19:24] <El_Che> ((o))

[19:24] <El_Che> here :)

[19:24] <bobbyJim> I don't know if it is proper to clutter this channel with that chatter?

[19:25] <bobbyJim> channel clutter chatter

[19:25] <El_Che> this channel is the most generic one

[19:25] <El_Che> there is also #moarvm and #perl6-dev

[19:26] <bobbyJim> mmmm yes those are targetted

[19:27] <bobbyJim> I was listening to a speaker extolling Node at a meetup, and all I could think about was "

[19:27] <bobbyJim> Perl could do this better

[19:27] <bobbyJim> "

[19:28] <El_Che> Not everything, but it will

[19:29] <Demos[m]> yeah like the biggest draw for node is that it's pretty fast consiering the language. Perl6 has a lot more headroom on this front

[19:30] <robertle> I thought the biggest draw of node was that you can do frontend and backend work in the same lang, which is really cool

[19:30] <robertle> ...so how is the JS backend again? ;)

[19:31] <Demos[m]> I kinda don't understand that draw

[19:31] <Demos[m]> but *shrug*

[19:32] <robertle> I guess it depends a bit on what your backend language is, but not everything fits well into one head at a time together with javascript

[19:33] <geekosaur> yeh, easier tot hink about interactions in one langauge instead of two

[19:33] <bobbyJim> The JS backend is easier to develop than Java.  For example, ORM is easy.  Even Node evangelists know that it's not the full solution, but it seems quite good for responsive front-end development, and I admit its ORM mapping is handy.

[19:33] <geekosaur> esp. snce your'e vulnerable to idiosyncratic differences in handling of json, yaml, ...

[19:34] <bobbyJim> Yes, you need a one-source standard.  I think V8/Google is Node's standard, but these things are moving targets, so...

[19:38] *** bobbyJim left
[19:40] <Demos[m]> one thing is that if you're compiling a language to JS the JS backend actually has to be good and a large portion of the ecosystem needs to support it

[19:41] <Demos[m]> nim has this problem. the js backend is good, but much of the ecosystem doesn't work on it

[19:42] <robertle> because some packages don't work and the transitive dependencies wreck the rest? or some othger reason?

[19:43] <Demos[m]> well it's a systems language, so plenty of packages make FFI calls to C

[19:43] <Demos[m]> and load DSOs and whatnot

[19:43] <Demos[m]> also the memory and threading model is different on JS as opposed to the C target
