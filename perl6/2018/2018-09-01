[15:42] <jjmerelo> @uzl I'm afraid so. It goes for all monthly versions. You can use rakudobrew to do it for you.

[15:45] <drudgesentinel> To further practice my perl6, I'm writing a very simple backup utility for my openbox configuration files. What module/method would you recommend for sending my file to a remote server?

[15:45] <uzl> jjmerelo: I see. By the way, what issues do you recommend for a somewhat beginner? Most of them in perl6/doc seem to be out of my grasp.

[15:58] <drudgesentinel> is it silly to try to do that in perl6 and I should just use bash?

[15:59] <TimToady> you could run scp directly without the shell

[20:43] <xinming> http://termbin.com/16gn    <--- For this kind of code, Can we issue a warning for this? something like, missing ',' in list. The reason I say this because I meet a subtle bug which is missing , in middle of a list definition

[20:43] <xinming> Or, someone gives me a better idea to avoid this problem.

[20:49] <lizmat> xinming: that feels like a bug to me: that shouldn't parse like that

[20:49] <Voldenet> m: my @a = x => { a => "a" },  y => { b => "b" }, z => { c => "c" }; @a.perl.say

[20:49] <Voldenet> m: my @a = x => { a => "a" },  y => { b => "b" } z => { c => "c" }; @a.perl.say

[20:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 39db408a1: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Strange text after block (missing semicolon or comma?)‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3 = x => { a => "a" },  y => { b => "b" }7‚èè5 z => { c => "c" }; @a.perl.say‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        infix‚ê§‚Ä¶¬ª

[20:49] <Voldenet> I use this syntax

[20:51] <lizmat> Voldenet: with the missing comma ?

[20:51] <Voldenet> No, the first one :D

[20:51] <Voldenet> in fact, if you remove newlines from the provided snippet, it works well

[20:53] <lizmat> you mean, it's a compilation error?

[20:54] <Voldenet> Indeed

[20:54] <lizmat> aaaahhhh

[20:54] <lizmat> I know what it is

[20:54] <jnthn> } as last thing on the line terminates a statement

[20:54] <lizmat> indeed

[20:55] <lizmat> so xinming: alas, it's a feature that maybe has too much DWIM so it causes a WAT

[20:55] <jnthn> Though we should perhaps detect the thing that's terminated that was is a list in sink context and complain

[20:55] *** benjikun left
[20:56] <jnthn> Wow, the grammar in that sentence is so broken I can't figure out what I meant to type :D

[20:56] <jnthn> We should be able to warn about the terminated part being a list in sink context

[20:56] <jnthn> We could maybe then add some smarts to the warning

[20:57] <Voldenet> in fact, doing http://ix.io/1lLY is even worse

[20:57] <Voldenet> :z() just disappears

[20:57] <lizmat> so definitely worth an issue, right, so it won't fall through the cracks  :-)

[21:25] <Kaiepi> i won't be able to contribute anything this squashathon since i'm dealing with some personal stuff atm but keep it up champs

[21:29] <Kaiepi> btw net::icmp's coming along, albeit slowly

[21:29] <Kaiepi> it almost works on *bsd, just need to finish that up and write the linux code for it before i can push it to cpan

[21:30] <Kaiepi> linux's version will be much speedier since there are plenty of examples out there

[21:30] <Kaiepi> s/speedier/\0 to write/

[21:31] <Kaiepi> and after that, Net::NNTP!

[21:32] <Kaiepi> that should be much simpler to write in comparison since i was forced to use c for Net::ICMP

[22:31] <stmuk_> perl seems to have lost its sense of humour

[22:31] <timotimo> call my sense of humor bad, but i'd be glad to not have any reference to mister drumpf in the conferences i attend

[22:32] <timotimo> there's been one that had the "make x great again" and it wasn't so great

[22:34] <timotimo> AFK again

[22:35] <lizmat> stmuk_: I think the world has a lot of rethinking on what humour is lately :-(
