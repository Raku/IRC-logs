[01:49] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ToddAndMargo

[01:49] <vrurg> timotimo: Ok, thanks! So, it's only a matter of somebody's will and time and efforts... 

[01:49] <ToddAndMargo> I am trying to test if a bit patter appears on another pattern.  This works, but seems awfully long winded:

[01:49] <ToddAndMargo> $ p5 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b1000; my $z=$x & $y; if $z gt 0 {say "True"} else {say "False"};' syntax error at -e line 1, near "if $z " Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.

[01:49] <timotimo> looks like

[01:50] <ToddAndMargo> Is there an operator for bitwise IN that I am missing?

[01:50] <timotimo> you're running it in perl5, is that what you meant to do?

[01:50] <ToddAndMargo> poop.  Wrong line

[01:50] <ToddAndMargo> $ p6 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b1000; my $z=$x +& $y; if $z {say "True"}else{say "False"};'

[01:50] <timotimo> well, yeah, you can make that shorter

[01:51] <timotimo> the if/else there is pretty redundant

[01:51] <timotimo> m: my $x = 0b1001; my $y = 0b1000; say so $x +& $y

[01:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 687a3cbb0: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[01:51] <timotimo> m: my $x = 0b1001; my $y = 0b0110; say so $x +& $y

[01:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 687a3cbb0: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[01:52] <timotimo> "so" turns its argument into a bool, so before it was 0b1000, and that turns into True

[01:54] <ToddAndMargo> yes.  If it find the second pattern in the first, then True.  I can write a sub for this, but I don't want thre reinvent the wheel.

[01:55] <timotimo> you don't need to write a sub for this, all you need is to use +& and use it either with "if" or "unless", or use it with "so" if you need a Bool result, for example for storing in a variable

[01:55] <timotimo> you'd either have "so $x +& $y", or you write "has-overlapping-bits($x, $y)"

[01:55] <timotimo> the latter can be a win in terms of readability

[01:55] <timotimo> but it's barely a difference :)

[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> $ p6 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b1000; my $z=$x +& $y; say so $z;' True

[01:58] <ToddAndMargo> p6 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b0100; my $z=$x +& $y; say so $z;' False

[01:59] <ToddAndMargo> Pretty Thank you!  Do I presume correctly that p6 does not have a bitwise "IN"?

[01:59] <timotimo> "bitwise in" is not a thing that i have heard of

[02:00] <timotimo> what does it do?

[02:00] <ToddAndMargo> I tried searching hte docs for "IN" but got a bazillion hits.  Thank y for the confirmatin.  And I adore "so"!!!!  LEarn somethign new every day.

[02:01] <timotimo> where did you find "IN"?

[02:01] <timotimo> in perl5?

[02:03] <ToddAndMargo> Never did.  I am writing a bitwise Keeper file and am documenting both p5 and p6.  That is why I copied the wrong line.

[02:03] <timotimo> ah, ok

[02:03] <timotimo> it sounded like you knew of a "bitwise IN" that you were expecting to find in perl6 because you had used it before in some other programming language or so

[02:04] <ToddAndMargo> Also, did you catch booboo in my logic?  if y is in x AND'ing shold give me back y

[02:04] <Herby_> timotimo: \o

[02:04] <timotimo> indeed, that's not true

[02:05] <timotimo> hey Herby_ 

[02:05] <ToddAndMargo> Oh no doublt.  I am 62 years old and have been programming stuff since I was a kid.  And to add to that I have also designed digital circuits

[02:05] <timotimo> oh

[02:05] <timotimo> no, you're right, i misread the sentence

[02:05] <Herby_> Does p6 have a module for generating fake data?

[02:05] <Herby_> I was reading a python article about the topic and found this module: https://pypi.org/project/Faker/

[02:06] <geekosaur> there aren't so much "langauges:" as packages that have such a thing; they underly things like interval arithmetic packages

[02:06] <ToddAndMargo> $ p6 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b0101; my $z=$x +& $y; say so $y eq $z;' False

[02:06] <ToddAndMargo> $ p6 'my $x=0b1001; my $y=0b1001; my $z=$x +& $y; say so $y eq $z;' True

[02:06] <geekosaur> and graphics packages sometimes

[02:06] <Juerd> ToddAndMargo: I've never before seen that explained as a number being "in" another number.

[02:07] <timotimo> ToddAndMargo: eq is an equality operator for strings, you probably want to use == here instead

[02:07] <ToddAndMargo> will do

[02:07] <Juerd> timotimo: Which is for numbers? :)

[02:07] <timotimo> using eq will not give an error, or wrong results. it'll just be slower

[02:07] <timotimo> Juerd: yes

[02:08] <Juerd> timotimo: Oh, sorry, I misread. Let's just keep it at "yes, == is for numbers" to avoid further confusion :)

[02:08] <timotimo> sure

[02:09] <timotimo> i'll head towards bed now

[02:09] <Juerd> Good night!

[02:09] <timotimo> o/

[05:53] <moritz> maybe need some other modifiers there...

[05:53] <Xliff_> I usually use "{...}" when I interpolate for exactly that reason. I was being fast.

[05:54] <Xliff_> ...and careless... but that's a given./

[08:11] <erana> Xliff_: if you do not know http://pharo.org

[08:12] <erana> There's traits in perl

[08:12] <erana> among other things from smalltalk

[08:12] <erana> It's just some offshore work, so I can program someting different 

[08:13] <erana> it's not mentioned in the hacker dictionary, in the languages of choice

[08:13] <erana> but it's nextstep in another language

[08:13] <erana> whereas apple used it in S. Jobs time

[08:14] <erana> Then I also do some SDL bound gnu smalltalk

[08:14] <erana> which is also fantastic to program in

[08:14] <tobs`> I want to `run` a memory-hungry child process. Is there a way (POSIX would be fine for a start) to set resource limits for the child, but not to the main process?

[08:14] * erana is a vi user

[08:14] <tobs`> I guess in C I would fork(), then setrlimit() before execve(), but the docs discourage forking

[08:15] <erana> tobs: nice, renice

[08:16] <erana> tobs: that's in you shell, there's probably a kernel userspace API for it

[08:16] <erana> (signal etc)

[08:18] <tobs`> erana: but niceness is only the process priority, isn't it? (I should've been clearer but) what I want is to limit memory consumption (maxrss)

[08:19] <erana> double fork ?

[08:19] <tobs`> but what you said gave me an idea: instead of `run` I could probably use `shell` and prepend a call to the ulimit shell built-in

[08:20] <erana> for example

[08:20] <erana> also look at shm

[08:20] <erana> shm == unix shared memory

[08:21] <erana> ulimit is bash

[08:21] <erana> that might work, but if you want to be portable in C,Perl you better renice in your environment

[08:22] <erana> with the kernel system call

[08:27] <tobs`> hm, I tested bash, zsh and mksh. All support ulimit

[08:28] <erana> sure, but not /bin/sh

[08:28] <erana> nor tcsh, csh AFAIK

[08:28] <erana> where csh is one of the BSD shells, which are not evil

[08:29] <erana> Also,

[08:29] *** Ven` joined
[08:30] <erana> You can do things with exec, execvp and system 

[08:30] <erana> in C or Perl

[08:30] <erana> you can run the nice command from these commmands

[08:30] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven`

[08:31] <tobs`> yes, I mentioned that at the beginning. The problem is that I would have to fork prior to setrlimit and forking is discouraged in the docs. Adjusting niceness doesn't help me, unless I misread and it can really be used to limit memory consumption(?)

[08:31] <erana> you can use the 'access' procedure in Perl to see if the nice command exists if you want to tprogram it this way

[08:32] <erana> no

[08:32] <erana> look, you cannot limit memory consumption except that it's a clean little ELF file in your kernel when you run the process

[08:33] <erana> if you want to limit from Perl/Perl6 you have to change the vm itself

[08:33] <erana> but,

[08:34] <erana> most processes are bare bones, they only coory as far as needednsume mem

[08:34] <erana> they only consume as far as needed

[08:34] <erana> so for example,

[08:35] <erana> you bootstrap the main procedure in C or Perl, you put in a grand chunk of memory for a Perl/C process but you have to watch the process mey usage with deletes and so onmor

[08:35] <erana> you can of course limit this with ulimit etc

[08:36] <erana> but you need to be inside the program to actually do what yantou w

[08:38] <tobs`> alright, thanks for your time

[08:38] <erana> np

[08:39] <erana> try to read the command 'nice' it's code, that should help

[08:39] <erana> in e.g. bash etc

[10:36] <azawawi> jnthn: the closest example to Perl6 that i could find was https://github.com/cazador481/App-LanguageServer-Perl

[10:40] <jnthn> azawawi: No plans for me to do that at the moment, no. Already juggling quite enough things, and I've kinda forbidden myself from starting any new big things until I get the Perl 6 concurrency book I want to write actually going somewhere. :)

[12:05] *** Mochi101 left
[12:09] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: we are talking about python functions indexed as such

[12:09] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: yes

[12:09] <jmerelo> Let's say this clearly, so that it sinks in. Some Python functions are indexed in the Perl 6 documentation, and show up as search results.

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> yes, “input” shows up as “input (Python)”

[12:10] <AlexDaniel> I see no way it can hurt but I see how it helps

[12:11] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: it hurts becausee you are looking for input in Perl 6, because you are in the Perl 6 documentation, and instead, a (apparently badly placed) reference for a Python function shows up

[12:11] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: what input in perl 6?

[12:11] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: exactly.

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> ?

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> why are you looking for a non-existent `input` in perl 6?

[12:12] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: and you get as a prize how you do input in Python?

[12:12] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: yes, because why did you type `input` there in the first place?

[12:13] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: whatever you think the answer is, it's probably not "Because I wanted to know how to do it in Python"

[12:14] <AlexDaniel> but what's your answer?

[12:14] <jmerelo> You can still type "input python" and then "use Google for searching"

[12:14] <AlexDaniel> and currently you don't need to go through google to do the same

[12:15] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: There's no answer to that. People will simply not expect Python functions when they type in the search slot of Perl 6 documentation.

[12:16] <AlexDaniel> http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2018-09-23#l490

[15:50] <jmerelo> Let me try Chromium

[15:51] <jmerelo> pmurias: nope, not in Chromium either.

[15:51] <timotimo> did you push the "run" button, jmerelo?

[15:51] <yoleaux> 10:21Z <azawawi> timotimo: I sent you a PR regarding SDL2::Raw. Please review and let me know if anything is needed. Thanks.

[15:52] <jmerelo> timotimo: yep.

[15:52] <timotimo> works on my end

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> doesn't work here too

[15:52] <timotimo> maybe you clicked it too early?

[15:52] <jmerelo> It loads in all three, produces an error "windows.evalP6 is not a function"

[15:52] <jmerelo> timotimo: Maybe

[15:52] <jmerelo> Let me see

[15:53] <timotimo> does "loaded eval enabling code" show up in the console?

[15:55] <jmerelo> timotimo: maybe, but it looks the same as the error for AlexDaniel's

[15:56] <jmerelo> Firefox is 62.0 in my case

[15:56] <jmerelo> timotimo: hey, that's cool!

[15:57] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: that's mean that your browser doesn't support bignum literals

[15:57] <jmerelo> Chrome is 65.0

[15:57] <pmurias> I should add a feature check for that

[18:50] <luqui> unless you have something else in mind...?

[18:51] <jmerelo> luqui: You're asking open source developers, it's only fair that you share the results of the survey with an open data license. Even if you weren't, as a matter of fact.

[22:15] <tbrowder__> hi, folks, need some advice. trying to teach an intro to coding using linux but it’s a huge learning curve for older windows users.  so i will try to do it on a windows host but i have no experience programming on windows other than cygwin and the OLD windows unix module.

[22:17] <tbrowder__> are notepad++ plus rakudo on windows plus powershell sufficient to run p6 in a linux-like manner?

[22:27] <Xliff_> tbrowder__: I find powershell to be more confusing than bash.

[22:28] <Xliff_> Do your users find cygwin bash to be too much, even though all of the commands they are familiar with are available?

[22:56] <tbrowder__> Xliff: i haven’t had an audience on windows yet, just trying to determine best way to do things on windows with folks who are not familiar with *nix environment.

[22:58] <tbrowder__> it’s too much of a steep learning curve to take long-time windows-only users to linux and introduce them to coding at the same time. we’re talking about middle-aged or older people who were not raised on computers.

[22:59] <Xliff_> tbrowder__: Sure. So using cygwin is probably the best of both worlds. Add to the fact that you can customize the command prompt environment to look like something familiar.

[23:00] <Xliff_> Most Windows users shy away from the command prompt, anyways

[23:00] <Xliff_> The only thing you'd use it for is running Perl6 code. As long as perl6 is in the path, they should have no problem.

[23:00] <Xliff_> The only big issue is getting them used to "/" instead of "\"

[23:01] <Xliff_> That shouldn't be THAT bad, especially if they are only using relative paths.

[23:01] <tbrowder__> except that installing cygwin is not for the faint of heart as i recall. my users will have to install our p6 environment themselves.

[23:01] <Xliff_> Now I am talking classroom environment. For home, something pre-packaged that they can double-click and get the same environment will probably be required.

[23:02] <Xliff_> Heh. Read my mind, there.

[23:02] <Xliff_> And yes. Cygwin install is problematic. I still don't think I have a working perl6 env directly on Windows. I have to use a VM to do my work.

[23:02] <tbrowder__> exactly, i don’t have the luxury of presetting a computer lab.

[23:03] <Xliff_> Then the only thing I can think to do is to write a wiki page with step-by-step installation instructions.

[23:03] <Xliff_> You can look at that as weeding out people who may NOT do well in your class. 

[23:03] <Xliff_> Writing that page will be time-consuming, but dooable.

[23:04] <Xliff_> They can think of it as performing their first homework assignment.

[23:06] <tbrowder__> you are right given the little info i’ve given. this shortncourse is experimental and the community college here has  not cooperated as they might have in offering dual-boot or prepared VM programs. it’s the typical windows-only outfit. but i’m trying to make headway.

[23:07] *** Xliff_ is now known as Xliff

[23:08] <Xliff> Of course, you could always prepare a VM image and get them to run it using VirtualBox.

[23:08] <Xliff> They'll probably have about as much difficulty getting that working as they would CygWin, of course.

[23:10] <tbrowder__> i tried that, but their network restrictions made the VM images almost unusable.

[23:10] <Xliff> Ah. OK.

[23:12] <tbrowder__> but there is hope i think, but not in time for this round. thanks for your input.

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> how can I `touch` a file in perl 6?

[23:36] <timotimo> open and close it

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: that works, thanks

[23:46] <SmokeMachine> m: role R { method r {...} }; class C { method r { 42 } }; class S does R { has C $.c handles <r> .= new }; say S.new.r # isn't it implemented?

[23:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 687a3cbb0: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Method 'r' must be implemented by S because it is required by roles: R.␤at <tmp>:1␤»

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: actually, wait, it doesn't

[23:47] <SmokeMachine> m: role R { #`(method r {...}) }; class C { method r { 42 } }; class S does R { has C $.c handles <r> .= new }; say S.new.r # isn't it implemented?

[23:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 687a3cbb0: OUTPUT: «42␤»

[23:47] <SmokeMachine> it seems implemented to me...

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: it does create a file, of course, but how do I update its mtime?

[23:50] <AlexDaniel> even writing an empty string doesn't help

[23:53] *** ZzZombo left
[23:54] <timotimo> oh? can you compare with strace what touch does vs what your script does?

[23:55] <geekosaur> toch on unixuses a syscall. which isn't portable

[23:55] <timotimo> oh, whoops

[23:55] <geekosaur> man 2 utimes

[23:56] <timotimo> i'm overdue for bed :S

[23:56] <timotimo> have a good one!

[23:57] <Xliff> AlexDaniel, you'd have to use nativecall, I think.

[23:58] <AlexDaniel> well, I can even do `run <touch -->, $file`, but I'm looking for a portable way

[23:58] <geekosaur> what Xliff said

[23:58] <AlexDaniel> portable way with nativecall?

[23:58] <geekosaur> or get them to modify print or what's under it so it will do 0-byte writes, but that has its ow implications

[23:58] <Xliff> Yeah. You'd just have to use the right call depending on the OS.

[23:59] <Xliff> Not exactly write once portable, but...

[23:59] <geekosaur> in particular, 0-byte write can interact with buffering (do you want a buffer flush? or to only do it on an unbuffered file? and can we even do that properly yet?)
