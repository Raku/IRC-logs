[04:37] <perlawhirl> so i think you will need to say: $word if lc($word) ~~ /<$tmp>/;

[04:38] <ccc> wouldn't be necessary if the :p was seen by the matcher, but my tests show that the matcher only ever gets the value

[04:38] <perlawhirl> lindylex: I don't understand why you are accepting args as *@wordNum, if you only care about the first arg.

[04:39] <perlawhirl> can just do: sub MAIN($pattern) { for 'words.txt'.IO.words -> $word { say $word if $word.lc ~~ /<$pattern>/ }

[04:43] <lindylex> perlawhirl : interesting it needed the <> around it to work.   

[04:44] <lindylex> Thanks

[04:44] <lindylex> It is so slow.  Any ideas how to speed it up?

[04:45] <perlawhirl> regex engine is quite slow at the moment, unfortunately :/

[04:45] <lindylex> Thanks I will try to use a system call instead then.

[04:48] <perlawhirl> FYI, it could also be golf'd down to: .say for 'words.txt'.IO.words.grep(/:i <$pattern> /)

[04:52] <lindylex> Oh let me try.

[04:52] <perlawhirl> it'll still be slow tho :D

[04:54] *** Herby_ left
[04:54] <perlawhirl> if i was using external grep... i would do it this way: .say for run(« grep -i "$pattern" words.txt », :out).out.lines

[04:56] <perlawhirl> the '/' in './words' is closing your 'q:x/'

[04:57] <perlawhirl> so use another delimiter, eg. .say for qq:x{ grep '$pattern' ./words.txt }

[04:57] <perlawhirl> and use 'qq' so that $vars get interpolated

[05:03] <perlawhirl> m: my %foo=(j => True, A => (2,3,5)); say %foo.pairs.grep(*.key eq any <A B C>)

[05:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar b07874e06: OUTPUT: «(A => (2 3 5))␤»

[05:04] <perlawhirl> sorry... '.pairs' isn't even needed there

[05:04] <perlawhirl> m: my %foo=(j => True, A => (2,3,5)); say %foo.grep(*.key eq any <A B C>)

[05:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar b07874e06: OUTPUT: «(A => (2 3 5))␤»

[05:04] <ccc> perlawhirl: no the one I used above is what I really wanted

[05:04] <ccc> m: my %foo=(j => True, A => (2,3,5)); say %foo{<A B C>}:p

[05:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar b07874e06: OUTPUT: «(A => (2 3 5))␤»

[05:05] <perlawhirl> ahh, i didn't see that message... nice work

[05:05] <perlawhirl> lindylex: yeah, external grep is much faster. it's nice that it's so easy to call from perl 6, but still wish regex engine was faster.

[05:07] <lindylex> Same, I feel like a failure.  

[05:09] <perlawhirl> think of it as a positive... you learned a bit more about how to call external commands in Perl 6

[05:09] <ccc> goodnight

[05:09] *** ccc left
[05:09] <lindylex> Indeed you are the best.

[05:11] <lindylex> One time I had a technical job interview for python.  The guy have a teask I made a system call because that tool would be faster he did not like it.  I said why not.  There production env is a unices.  He was not having it and said everything must be within the language.  I was like dud if it can be done a faster way with a system call why does it matter?  I proposed no security risk.

[05:12] <lindylex>  It proposed no security risk.

[05:13] <lindylex> ccc: nite

[05:14] <perlawhirl> there are 2 sides... i usually try to write everything in language. you can't always rely on system commands (and flags!) being portable across unix/linux/bsd. but, if there's no need for portability and it's faster, it can be a quick win

[11:35] <MorayJ`> Hi, I'm looking to do some edits on https://docs.perl6.org/type/Cool and need clarification on what are methods and what are routines. Had thought methods would be those defined as method, and routines as those defined as sub or method and sub. Doesn't seem to be the case. Anyone able to give me a quick explanation or a link to an explanation..?

[11:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v chenyf_

[11:38] *** lichtkind joined
[11:39] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v lichtkind

[11:47] <moritz> that's how it's supposed to be

[11:47] <moritz> Routine is the parent class of Sub and Method

[11:51] <MorayJ`> method exp

[11:51] <MorayJ`> Defined as:

[11:51] <MorayJ`> multi sub exp(Cool:D $pow, Cool:D $base?)

[11:51] <MorayJ`> Whoops sorry, bad pasting

[11:51] *** ZzZombo joined
[11:51] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ZzZombo

[11:52] <MorayJ`> Method exp (for instance) is defined as a multi sub and a multi method - would that then be best be described as a routine?

[11:56] <MorayJ`> And if something is only defined as a sub, should it then be sub name?

[11:57] *** psychoslave joined
[11:57] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v psychoslave

[11:58] <moritz> both correct

[12:01] <MorayJ`> Great...thanks. Will raise it as an issue and look into fixing it

[12:14] <lichtkind> how to get a change into modules.perl6.org if module changes to different fork

[12:17] <moritz> get the maintainer to merge it?

[12:22] <lichtkind> moritz, i dont understand what you mean but Pierre, (current  owner) and meare of one opinion that it should move to my github adress

[12:23] *** araraloren joined
[12:23] <moritz> lichtkind: then you should change the URL in the ecosystem repo

[12:26] <lichtkind> moritz ah thanks thats what i wanted know, becaause i looked on the modules repo

[12:35] <moritz> araraloren: looks like a bug to me

[12:35] <moritz> m: class A { has $!a; method f(:$!a) { } }; say A.find_method('a').signature.params[0].twigil

[12:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar b07874e06: OUTPUT: «No such method 'find_method' for invocant of type 'A'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:35] <El_Che> moritz: yes, I thought so. But it's good that you know in case someone asks here.

[12:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v domidumont

[12:37] <El_Che> moritz: I was having a look at the new Learning Perl 6. I think your Fundamentals books approach works better

[12:37] <araraloren> moritz I check the source code, so it only support attribute, not for dynamic variable ?

[12:38] <El_Che> moritz: haven't finished Learning yes, just impression after a few chapters

[12:39] <moritz> El_Che: it has quite a bit of a different target audience

[12:39] <moritz> El_Che: and you are squarely in the Fundamentals target audience, not in the Learning one

[12:39] <moritz> Learning and Thinking overlap more in audience

[12:39] <El_Che> I don't know about that

[12:40] <El_Che> Thinking is more about learning to program

[12:40] <araraloren> I will fill an ticket :)

[12:40] <El_Che> and it happens to be with Perl 6

[12:40] <El_Che> Learning has a reference book feel to it (without being one)

[12:40] <El_Che> e.g. as it feels compelled to discussed complex numbers, while it's out of the scope of most readers

[12:42] <MorayJ`> moritz: I quoted you in the issue. Just to confirm I understood. "Moritz confirmed on #perl6 "Routine is the parent class of Sub and Method" and that if only a method, it should be method name, if only a sub it should be sub name and if both routine name"

[12:42] <El_Che> Moritz as an argument by authority. I like that :)

[12:44] <MorayJ`> If Moritz is happy with it, I'll leave it for a while and see if anyone has anything to add, but a good authority from what I can tell :-)

[16:17] <timotimo> seems like we don't support that, but also don't error out

[16:17] <Xliff> Yes. :)

[16:17] <timotimo> but what you want may be .assuming rather than putting a constant in the signature

[16:17] <timotimo> since constants there are about matching, not "providing for the caller"

[20:20] <sarna> yes

[20:22] <sarna> well, I have troubles expressing myself today. I meant - is there a standard way of doing this stuff? should I just load the entire file into memory, loop over the lines, check for matches, insert text I need and overwrite the file?

[20:24] <moritz> the best way is typically to write a temp file with the new contents

[20:26] *** mcmillhj joined

[20:31] *** mcmillhj left

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> that shouldn't slurp the whole file, right?

[20:32] <AlexDaniel> I mean, even .lines probably won't

[20:32] <masak> moritz: re "temp file with the new contents" -- doesn't the -i flag do this in Perl 5?

[22:39] <geekosaur> it sees $a[1]= (30, $a.say), runs say with the value before the assignment, and then drops the result of say because there's nowhee to put it

[22:42] *** mcmillhj joined
[22:42] <lucasb> I thought it was item assignment, so precedence of "=" was tighter than comma

[22:42] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mcmillhj

[22:42] <timotimo> it's the difference between item assignment and list assignment

[22:42] <timotimo> the LHS of the = doesn't look like something listy

[22:43] <timotimo> so $a.say doesn't become part of the assignment

[22:43] <timotimo> oh, er

[22:43] <lucasb> $a[1] becomes (30, True)

[22:43] <timotimo> hm, that's not entirely right, i don't think

[22:43] <timotimo> because it does evaluate the whole list first

[22:44] <lucasb> m: my $a = 10; ($a = 20, $a.say)

[22:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85da7b206: OUTPUT: «20␤»

[22:46] <lucasb> so, @a[...] and %h{...} always imposes list assignment (?)

[22:46] *** mcmillhj left
[22:47] <lucasb> m: my @a; @a[1] = 1,2,3; say @a  # seems so. My mistake was that I was expecting item assignment here

[22:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 85da7b206: OUTPUT: «[(Any) (1 2 3)]␤»

[22:47] <lizmat> lucasb: only if what's between [] and {} is Iterable

[22:49] <lizmat> sleep&

[22:53] <timotimo> TBH i don't have a complete understanding of when it does one vs the other

[22:53] <timotimo> since it's a syntactic distinction, as both have different precedence levels
