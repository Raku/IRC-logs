[11:44] <El_Che> I don't get what the problem was. Github is depreciating the integration in favour of webhooks, but they haven't kill it yet

[11:45] <El_Che> I just removed what we had, and created a new one according to the new docs

[11:45] <El_Che> which is btw way easier

[11:45] <El_Che> just login to travis with github and enable the repo

[11:46] <El_Che> no need to enable the integration

[12:25] <timotimo> ooh, unfluencing, he?

[12:25] <timotimo> that's a funny word

[12:28] <lizmat> well... if you look at docs.perl6.org for how to create objects, it was one of the first things you'd see

[12:28] <lizmat> it should be more or less the last thing to be seen, if ever

[12:28] <lizmat> imo  :-)

[12:29] <lizmat> especially since BUILDALL is now generated for each class

[12:35] <timotimo> right

[12:36] <timotimo> i should check again whether TWEAK still looks like an "alternative to BUILD" 

[12:36] <timotimo> rather than "the first thing you should reach for, unless you have very specific needs"

[20:59] <Zoffix> What are "value-less" `next`/`last` etc? Are there value-full forms or are these test descriptions simply wrong? https://github.com/perl6/roast/blob/master/S04-statements/for.t#L468-L480

[21:00] <AlexDaniel> maybe it's about labels?
