[11:38] *** Cabanossi joined
[11:38] <Swinebead> I've not had to code for several years but learned perl 5 and now perl6 is out

[11:38] <Swinebead> It all looks straightforward except for the parallel stuff

[11:39] <masak> (I always thought "released"/"not released" was a funny distinction to use for an open-source project, but there you go... people seem to think that way)

[11:39] <Swinebead> Where's a good place to understand? The docs confused me a bit

[11:39] <masak> there are books on the way

[11:39] <masak> this channel is a pretty great place to learn

[11:39] <moritz> I'm biased, but I like https://leanpub.com/perl6 :-)

[11:39] *** xtreak left

[11:40] <moritz> (pro tip: buy it today, tomorrow you can't buy it anymore because a publisher takes over)

[15:43] <bazzaar> brilliant blog series by Oracle using matplotlib from perl6, with Inline::Python, in Part7 last coloured butterfly plot, found I needed to add .cache to $x,$y sequences to get it to work, couldn't find a way to add comment or send email

[15:49] <timotimo> hm, what version of perl6 are you running?

[15:51] <bazzaar> timotimo: Rakudo version 2017.01 built on MoarVM version 2017.01 implementing Perl 6.c

[15:52] <timotimo> okay, that's a little out of date, but it's probably the latest rakudo star you can get

[15:52] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem: matiaslina++ created pull request #316: Add Matrix::Client to ecosystem

[15:52] <Geth> ¬¶ ecosystem: review: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/pull/316

[15:52] <timotimo> perhaps it's not necessary in a newer version

[15:52] *** abraxxa left
[15:53] <bazzaar> timotimo: been having issues with datetime.date too :-) , looking forward to upgrading to next rakudo star

[15:54] <timotimo> aye, this upcoming release will come with a rakudo-star

[15:54] <timotimo> until then, we actually just started building AppImages for rakudo and rakudo-star

[15:55] <timotimo> https://samcv.github.io/rakudo-appimage/ - feel free to try 'em out

[15:56] <isBEKaml> timotimo: Sorry, what are appimages? Docker? Digital Ocean?

[15:57] <timotimo> neither of those

[15:57] *** jmiven left
[15:57] <timotimo> appimage is just chmod +x my.appimage; ./my.appimage

[15:57] <isBEKaml> timotimo: Oh, okay. When are we doing the next Star release?

[15:58] <timotimo> NeuralAnomaly: status

[15:58] <NeuralAnomaly> timotimo, [‚úò] Next release will be in 1 day and 12 hours. Since last release, there are 24 new still-open tickets (0 unreviewed and 1 blockers) and 138 unreviewed commits. See http://perl6.fail/release/stats for details

[15:58] <isBEKaml> \o/

[15:58] <timotimo> i think zoffix wanted to delay it by a bit, i don't know if that is already in this date/time or not

[16:02] <timotimo> oh, cool

[16:02] *** Dunearhp joined
[16:03] <bazzaar> timotimo: I like those AppImages, and the instruction how to run 'em, it'll give folk a way of seeing if an issue in their code is due to running an oldish perl6 implementation 

[16:03] <timotimo> yeah, should be good

[16:04] <timotimo> also, currently travis jobs for checking modules will pull down moar, nqp, and rakudo, compile all of them, then install zef, and then it'll test the module

[16:04] <timotimo> using an appimage that gets updated daily or more often will clearly be much better

[16:04] *** mcmillhj left
[16:10] *** Zoffix joined
[16:11] <RabidGravy> yeah, it takes ten times as long to build rakudo than it does most of the tests for my modules

[16:12] <Zoffix> The bot reports normal time, and there's still the posibility it'll be delayed by 2 days. And that's the time for *compiler* release only. Rakudo Star was planned to be done in 2017.04 and with the RC releases the final release of it is usually 1-2 weeks after the compiler's release.

[16:12] <Zoffix> So normal time is 3rd Saturday of the month, but this month it might be delayed by 2 days to be on Monday

[16:13] <timotimo> thanks for the clarification

[16:13] <RabidGravy> my tablet needed 36 apps updated

[16:15] <Zoffix> And delay is due: squeezing all IO into the release. I'm gonna be done with all the functionality changes by normal release date, but the 2 day delay will let me squeeze in all the performance improvements as well; especially on Windows. If that stuff misses the release, regular users will only get it in July, when next-next Rakudo Star ships. So, I figured may as well delay this release by 2 days and ship it

[16:15] <Zoffix> all in it

[16:16] <Zoffix> ^ and that's not a real blocker. It's just a reminder for me to throw out TAP.pm6 from core; the release bot won't proceed when there are blockers :)

[21:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar fbc669: OUTPUT: ¬´25‚ê§¬ª

[21:55] <sammers> whenever I do the . notation chaining on subs I can't put the .bar on a newline...

[21:55] <sammers> like we can with methods

[21:55] <timotimo> yeah, only allowed when . is followed by alphanumeric

[21:55] <timotimo> actually, alpha only

[21:56] <sammers> thanks, that is mentioned here https://docs.perl6.org/routine/$FULL_STOP

[21:58] <sammers> is there a technical reason for that? or is this some rational decision to not allow this?

[21:58] <timotimo> still wanna catch people trying to use . for concat

[22:00] <sammers> ok, so with .& that would look something like: 'string ' . &foo(123)

[23:32] <sammers> I wonder if it might make sense to have an exception for `.&`? I am most likely not considering all situations, but other than this, where else would .& or . & be attempted?  sub bar($b){$b}; say "first" . &bar("second"); # which should fail with Unsupported use of . to concatenate strings;

[23:33] *** labster joined
[23:34] <AlexDaniel> sammers: why put whitespace around . at all in this case?

[23:35] <sammers> right, I wouldn't. that is the case they are trying to capture 

[23:35] <sammers> for p5 users when they use . for concat instead of ~

[23:36] <sammers> for method chaining .n has to be followed by an alpha. but what about subs that need to be called with & or unicode names?

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> m: sub bar($a, $b){ $a ~ $b}; say ‚Äòfirst‚Äô\ .\ &bar(‚Äòsecond‚Äô)

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar fbc669: OUTPUT: ¬´firstsecond‚ê§¬ª

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> m: sub bar($a, $b){ $a ~ $b}; say ‚Äòfirst‚Äô\   .&bar(‚Äòsecond‚Äô)

[23:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar fbc669: OUTPUT: ¬´firstsecond‚ê§¬ª

[23:36] <timotimo> i'd +1 a flag that prevents those "you're a naughty p5 programmer, aren't you?" errors

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> just use unspace instead

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: sometimes I feel like +1-ing a full removal of p5 errors

[23:37] <sammers> ok, I know that we can use the unspace now, but, I am suggesting that there could be an exception for .&

[23:37] <sammers> for chaining 

[23:37] <AlexDaniel> sammers: or at least the error message can be more awesome by suggesting unspace

[23:37] <timotimo> do we also want an exception for .""?

[23:37] <timotimo> well, have to spell it .""()

[23:37] <sammers> just sub names

[23:38] <sammers> so if there is a unicode sub name

[23:40] <sammers> it would be nice to just chain methods / subs regardless. as long as they had valid sub / method names.

[23:40] *** gdonald left
[23:40] <sammers> without unspace

[23:41] *** gdonald joined
[23:43] <timotimo> it's a little dangerous that putting a .foo on the next line after something is highly sensitive to the presence or absence of a ;

[23:43] <timotimo> if the user doesn't make it clear with indentation, it can be misleading

[23:45] <sammers> "(1,2,3)\n.map(...)\\n.&bar(special => 'second')\n.grep(...)\\n&foo.say;"

[23:45] <sammers> like this example, http://perl6intro.com/#_chaining

[23:45] <sammers> if you use your own subs inbetween you have to unescape

[23:45] <sammers> of you put the routines on a new line

[23:48] <TimToady> re .&foo, you can always put .self.&foo if you hate unspace

[23:49] <timotimo> m: say &unique

[23:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar fbc669: OUTPUT: ¬´sub unique (| is raw) { #`(Sub|60835656) ... }‚ê§¬ª

[23:49] <timotimo> oh, didn't realize

[23:49] <timotimo> so, here's something hilarious

[23:49] <sammers> hmm

[23:49] <TimToady> on the design decision to allow .foo on the next line, most of the time when you default to $_ it's in a very small context, a map or grep or small loop, which tends to work against the situation where you want a lot of newlines

[23:50] <TimToady> so they don't overlap as much as you'd expect

[23:50] <timotimo> trying to open a file with a really long name gives a funny result

[23:50] <timotimo> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa: name to

[23:50] <TimToady> or to put it the other way, when you use a lot of newlines, you're unlikely to be defaulting methods to $_

[23:50] <timotimo> dang, it didn't copy over

[23:50] <TimToady> you're more likely to be using explicit vars in that case

[23:51] <timotimo> 000003f0: 6161 6161 6161 3a20 6e61 6d65 2074 6f00  aaaaaa: name to.

[23:51] <timotimo> 00000400: 1300 0000 000a 2020 696e 2062 6c6f 636b  ......  in block

[23:51] <timotimo> it totally put a 00 byte there %)

[23:52] <sammers> that makes sense, I like to use a lot of small subs and write them in a way that allows me to chain them. so it isn't that I am unable to chain them, it would just be "nice" to be able to chain them like any other method when I have to use .&. 

[23:55] <timotimo>         char      *c_message = MVM_malloc(1024);

[23:55] <timotimo> OH NO YOU DIDN'T :D :D :D

[23:59] <samcv> hmm?
