[00:24] <MasterDuke> tbrowder: something like this perhaps? `for $pod -> $_ is rw { $_ = pod2text($_) }; my $string = $pod.join("\n\n");`

[01:01] <Zoffix> .tel ksn00b yes, `when` can smartmatch one an Enum. Your issue was you used commas inside the `<...>`. The angle brackets already separate on space; no need for commas. Also, enums can start at values other than 0. Also, `when` can be used without a `give`. It smartmatches against the topic (the $_ variable). https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/1fe539715b0332be7361990785b0dd87

[01:48] <timotimo> looks like it's not closing over the $r as much as you were expecting, and i'm not sure what amount of closing is to be expected here

[01:50] <timotimo> more likely the regex compilation isn't closing over the $r as much as you're expecting it to

[01:53] <zengargoyle> so the additional -> code is somehow makes $r more closed.  why doesn't this affect the eq version as well or is it just some regex thing.  hrm...

[13:05] <Zoffix> How to get symbols the module exports via EXPORT sub?

[13:06] <Zoffix> m: require Test; dd ::('UNIT::Test::EXPORT::DEFAULT::&is')

[13:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 608e88: OUTPUT: «Sub is = sub is (;; Mu | is raw) { #`(Sub|75608552) ... }␤»

[13:06] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -Irepo/lib -e 'require Benchy; dd ::("UNIT::Benchy::EXPORT::DEFAULT::&b")'

[13:06] <Zoffix> Failure.new(exception => X::NoSuchSymbol.new(symbol => "UNIT::Benchy::EXPORT::DEFAULT::\&b"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)

[13:06] <Zoffix> Seems the above way only works for routines marked with `is export`

[13:08] <ufobat> is tehre a better way for sub a($a where {$a ~~ Int|Callable}) { ... }

[13:09] <Zoffix> ufobat: $a where Int|Callable

[13:09] <Zoffix> `where` smartmatches already

[13:10] <Zoffix> also: multi a (Int $a) {}; multi a (&a) {}

[21:24] <AlexDaniel> but for bisectable it is too much thinking on your side :)

[21:25] <AlexDaniel> the reason it didn't work is because it should be “ne '(CArray[Pointer])'” I think (with parens)

[21:25] <AlexDaniel> c: cdc3fb041^,cdc3fb041,518b46feb^,518b46feb use NativeCall; CArray[int]; say CArray[Pointer]

[21:25] <committable6> AlexDaniel, ¦cdc3fb041^: «(TypedCArray[Pointer])» ¦cdc3fb0,518b46feb^: «(CArray[Pointer])» ¦518b46f: «(Pointer])»

[21:25] <AlexDaniel> raiph: ↑ this is basically the whole history of that thing changing :)

[21:25] <raiph> that's amazing

[21:52] <timotimo> that got renamed a while back

[21:52] *** st_elmo left
[21:52] <timotimo> but CArray is always of pointers to structs if they aren't of native nums or ints

[21:54] <raiph> m: use NativeCall; put gist CArray[Pointer] # timotimo: this is the tangent I'm chasing right now

[21:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: OUTPUT: «(Pointer])␤»

[21:54] <raiph> note the missing `CArray[`

[21:56] <timotimo> interesting

[21:56] <timotimo> m: use NativeCall; put CArray[Pointer].^name; put CArray[Pointer].^long_name

[21:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: OUTPUT: «NativeCall::Types::CArray[NativeCall::Types::Pointer]␤No such method 'long_name' for invocant of type 'Perl6::Metamodel::ClassHOW+{<anon>}+{<anon>}'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:56] <timotimo> is it perhaps actually shortname?

[21:56] <timotimo> m: use NativeCall; put CArray[Pointer].^shortname;

[21:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: OUTPUT: «Pointer]␤»

[21:56] <timotimo> right, that's b0rked

[21:57] * timotimo spits hot debug printfs

[21:58] *** nadim left
[21:59] <timotimo> ah, interesting

[21:59] <timotimo> in set_name it spits by :: and sets the shortname to be only the stuff after the last ::

[21:59] <timotimo> that's in Naming.nqp

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> beginner: like a class?

[22:15] <raiph> beginner: create a new class with whatever attributes and/or methods you want

[22:15] <timotimo> beginner: what do you consider a "data type"?

[22:16] <raiph> m: enum my-enum <a b c>; role my-role {}; class my-class {}; grammar my-grammar {}; # etc.

[22:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: ( no output )

[22:16] <AlexDaniel> so everyone was quiet for 8 minutes, and then we all decided to reply in one second? :)

[22:17] <raiph> heh

[22:17] <beginner> timotimo : suppose a need a type that contains underscore and digits

[22:18] <MasterDuke> or like the examples from the discussion from yesterday. subset My-Int of Int where ... . constant My-Array = Array of Int

[22:19] <raiph> m: subset MyType of Str where / '_' / & / \d ** {2..Inf} /

[22:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: ( no output )

[22:19] <jnthn> m: subset MyType of Str where /^ <[0..9_]>+ $/; my MyType $x = '123_456'

[22:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: ( no output )

[22:19] <jnthn> m: subset MyType of Str where /^ <[0..9_]>+ $/; my MyType $x = '123_456!!!'

[22:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5e3393: OUTPUT: «Type check failed in assignment to $x; expected MyType but got Str ("123_456!!!")␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:20] *** pecastro joined
[22:20] <jnthn> Heh, I see raiph and I took the alternative interpretations of the problem. :)

[22:20] <beginner> AlexDaniel : we have built in types like int for numbers ,str for characters. I need to create a type that is combination of number and symbols

[22:21] *** ne_robot left
[22:23] <raiph> beginner: if a dynamically checked type is OK then I think creating a subset type as demo'd above is the natural solution
