[10:28] <zengargoyle> there are a few slightly similar things in the Japanese codepoints where there are 4 characters arranged in a 2x2 pattern as a single glyph.  probably a holdover from the pre-unicode days and cellphones.

[12:21] <lollercopter> samcv: not IMO. No other IO routines take their paths in arbitrary chunks like that, so adding this would be inconsistent. You can always use '/' as the separator, so it'd be $*CWD.child('foo/bar') or $*CWD.child: @parts.join: '/' and will just work and will be faster than adding a slurpy multi candidate.

[12:53] <zengargoyle> hrm... i thought 'rule { <F> | <F> <B> }' would do longest match.  that didn't work but 'rule { <F> <B> | <F> }' did.

[13:05] <timotimo> only does longest match with the declarative prefix

[13:05] <timotimo> so maybe you have something in F that stops the longest token from becoming any longer

[13:17] <zengargoyle> hrm,  <F> maches 'now' and <B> matches '+ 1 min'.  they're pretty direct exact match of a specific string or digit.

[13:17] <timotimo> strange, can you golf it?

[13:19] *** domidumont joined
[13:20] <zengargoyle> i'm not sure, it goes down a few levels from F and B.  lemme see.

[13:27] <zengargoyle> it works if backtracking or the longest match is given first.

[13:28] *** Cabanossi joined
[13:32] <zengargoyle> timotimo: what's 'declarative prefix'?

[13:34] <zengargoyle> there's a TOP { ^^ <t> $$ } around that in reality.

[13:34] <timotimo> the initial part of a regex that can be matched with a simple DFA

[13:35] <timotimo> so no backreferences, or lookahead/lookbehind, no code blocks

[13:37] <jnthn> rule { <F> | <F> <B> } # <.ws> is not declarative, so these two have identical declarative prefixes

[13:37] <zengargoyle> so that S can match some pretty complicated things (it just doesn't in this case since one of the things it can match is 'now')  does that negate longest matching?

[13:39] <zengargoyle> ok, that makes some sense.  will arranging the branches in longest to shortest help any?

[13:40] <zengargoyle> i basically just tried to transcribe the .l file into tokens and the .y file into rules as straightforward as possible.

[13:40] <zengargoyle> this is the unix `at` command's time specificaton format...

[13:43] * zengargoyle figures if lex/yacc can do it, Grammars can too one way or another. :)

[13:51] *** nightfrog joined
[13:52] <timotimo> jnthn: ah! i would have missed <.ws> there

[13:52] <timotimo> zengargoyle: you can change your <ws> token to behave differently or use something other than "rule

[13:59] <zengargoyle> cool, i have it parsing all of the strings from the minimal test program shipped with the `at` src.  i think everything is simple enough to order by longest and use regex if needed.
