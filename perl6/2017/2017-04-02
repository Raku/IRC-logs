[00:05] <samcv> yay I finally got travis to spit out coverage stats https://travis-ci.org/samcv/MoarVM/builds/217646397#L1051

[00:07] <timotimo> ttttttttravis

[00:08] <timotimo> nan% covered <3

[00:08] <samcv> heh

[00:08] <timotimo> in green

[00:08] <timotimo> because why not

[00:08] <timotimo> i'm making progress with the moarvm MVMObject pretty-printer

[00:08] <samcv> well it has no functions in the file

[00:08] <timotimo> even though i didn't expect it at all

[00:14] <timotimo> MVMObject * (IterationBuffer) of repr VMArray = {...}, data=0x7ffff4d6dc60, value=..., kind=8)

[00:15] <timotimo> i have no idea why the data= is there, or what the value= is supposed to be ... and i also don't really know why kind= is in there?

[00:16] <timotimo> oh

[00:16] <timotimo> that's the rest of the function arguments

[00:17] <timotimo> (gdb) print root[0]

[00:17] <timotimo> $2 = 0x7ffff7dbed40

[00:17] <timotimo> MVMObject (IterationBuffer) = {0x7ffff7d23060

[00:17] <timotimo> MVMObject * (Scalar), 0x7ffff7d23060

[00:17] <timotimo> MVMObject * (Scalar), 0x7ffff7d23060

[00:17] <timotimo> MVMObject * (Scalar)}

[00:17] <timotimo> that's not even bad!

[00:18] <timotimo> the hex values are debug prints

[00:18] <timotimo> but having "Scalar" for every entry is a bit rubbish :) :)

[00:19] *** Guest36204 is now known as Ven`

[00:20] <timotimo> $1 = MVMObject * (array[int]) = {476821, 476822, 476823, 476824, 476825, 476826, 476827, 476828, 476829, 476830, 

[00:20] <timotimo> yay~

[00:22] <timotimo> oh ... pretty printing MVMHash from inside python code using gdb will be ... fun :(

[00:22] <timotimo> but first: P6opaque

[00:25] <samcv> and i figured out how to only include certain files now

[00:26] <samcv> can supply it a list of files. so using find ./src -name '*.c' | grep -v unicode.h

[00:26] <samcv> err .c. cause that has our whole unicode database in it. so not gonna do that one for now

[00:31] <timotimo> yeah, that's probably good :)

[00:31] <samcv> thanks travis

[00:32] <samcv> when i tried to print out coverage stats for all src .c files except unicode db file

[00:34] <samcv> /Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: eval: line 54: syntax error: unexpected end of file

[00:36] <samcv> it's only 80,000 lines. they could have at least had some kind of normal error message or something if i can't print out 80,000 lines

[00:39] <samcv> well i'm very close to getting it to put each file coverage in a seperate html file. so then after i do that, will figure out how way to upload it somewhere

[00:42] <timotimo> \o/

[00:43] <timotimo> hum. how do i teach gdb that "if this value is to be stringified, it has its STable living at this other address"?

[00:45] <samcv> no clue

[00:45] <timotimo> maximum shrug ...

[00:46] <timotimo> like, i'd have to introspect the flattened stables to figure out what byte size a given attribute has, and its signedness

[00:46] <timotimo> (if it's an int)

[00:49] <samcv> F A N C Y 

[00:49] <samcv> https://cry.nu/coverage/

[00:50] <samcv> check it out timotimo 

[00:50] <timotimo> that's rad!

[00:50] <samcv> \o/

[00:51] <timotimo> everything is red :o

[00:51] <timotimo> oh

[00:51] <timotimo> just bad luck selecting a .c file

[00:52] <timotimo> https://cry.nu/coverage/coverage/home/samantha/git/MoarVM/src/main.c.html ??

[00:53] <samcv> that's in moar binary not libmoar.so

[00:53] <samcv> the ones that are missing were either added in the last day or are files that i need to run the command on moar binary not libmoar.so

[00:53] <samcv> there are only a few of them

[00:54] <samcv> maybe can come up with something with tables

[00:54] <samcv> so can have the index of filenames and also show the overall file stats

[00:55] <samcv> without having to process tons of files into new formats and do a ton of work

[00:55] *** Actualeyes joined
[00:57] <samcv> timotimo, uploading new files now

[00:57] <samcv> this is really awesome tho :-) very happy

[00:58] <raschipi> timotimo: I got a 404 from your last link

[00:58] <samcv> not anymore raschipi 

[00:58] <samcv> i just generated the ones that are in the moar binary and not in libmoar.so (which has 95% of the files in it)

[00:58] <timotimo> raschipi: that's why i "??"'d ti

[00:59] <raschipi> Yep, thanks. Never seen a snappier bugfix before.

[00:59] <samcv> if there's any missing now, let me know and i'll try and figure out how to make it generate for that

[00:59] *** cyphase joined
[00:59] <samcv> and these coverage are for the nqp test suite fyi

[00:59] <timotimo> pretty cool.

[01:01] <timotimo>     self.val.hello = "bar"

[01:01] <timotimo> AttributeError: 'gdb.Value' object has no attribute 'hello'

[01:01] <timotimo> aren't i supposed to be able to put any new field on a python object that i want?

[01:03] <geekosaur> no

[01:03] <geekosaur> at least, not like that

[01:04] <samcv> also https://cry.nu/coverage/report-libmoar.html

[01:04] <samcv> this is an overview

[01:04] *** Ven` left
[01:04] <timotimo> that looks really good

[01:04] <timotimo> per-function is a lot nicer than just per-file

[01:04] <samcv> yeah

[01:05] <samcv> and here is https://cry.nu/coverage/report-moar.html for moar. which only has main.c on it. otherwise is blank

[01:05] <timotimo> yeah, probably not interesting at all

[01:05] <samcv> will have to find some way to get those combined somehow

[01:05] <timotimo> unless we want to cover moar's option parser

[01:05] <timotimo> nah, forget it

[01:05] <samcv> main.c has pretty low coverage

[01:06] <samcv> hahah

[01:06] <timotimo> main.c has pretty low impact

[01:06] <samcv> yeah

[01:06] <samcv> well we could cover it and just write some moar tests or something idk

[01:06] <samcv> to try the different options and such.

[01:50] <timotimo> too tired to think

[01:50] <u-ou> so I wonder how it works with precompiled regexes

[08:39] <samcv> Zoffix, was link not previously documented?

[08:44] <Zoffix> samcv: I guess it was (not sure how I missed it), but it has the same problem as the docs for symlink

[08:44] <samcv> but the order was not what our other commands were

[08:45] <Zoffix> it's currently implemented as $link, $target, but it's documented as $target, $link, with the prose confused about what "target" means.

[08:46] <samcv> yeah. for sure

[08:46] <samcv> argh tired. night everybody

[08:46] <Zoffix> all the other related routines and command line tools use $existing-thing, $new-thing format (so that's $target, $link for &link/&symlink)

[09:30] <moritz> in unrelated news, it looks like "Perl 6 by Example" will be published through a major tech publisher, both in print and ebook form

[16:11] <tbrowder> hi, Voldenet.  I saw the same thing you saw about the type graphs, but there is a reference to them on the same page.  Let me find it.

[16:14] <Voldenet> hm, "See also the related class IO::Path"

[16:16] <tbrowder> Ok, on role IO doc it mentions related classes IO::Handle and IO::Paths and it shows the IO::Handle but not the IO::Path. a bug maybe? hm, I can't find IO::Path in the same type graph with any of the others. AlexDaniel??

[16:19] <tbrowder> Ach!  Zoffix is modifying stuff on IO::Handle--I hope I haven't messed that up!

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: yes, Zoffix probably has a better answer

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: he hangs around on #perl6-dev

[20:10] <moritz> $_ = @ls[l].subst(/^ '# '/, '')

[20:10] <ParsonsNose> That looks much cleaner, tnx

[20:11] <moritz> timotimo: but then we could name it .remove :-)

[20:12] <timotimo> yeah

[20:12] <timotimo> well, i think in python you'd use .lstrip('# ') for that, even though it'd then also strip off "   " or "###" or " # "
