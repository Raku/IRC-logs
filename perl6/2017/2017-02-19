[01:46] <TimToady> though probably doesn't work in a grammar that defines FAILGOAL

[01:49] <timotimo> TimToady: do we have a clue how we can emit regexes that don't actually compile to regexes?

[01:49] <timotimo> for example, on the mailing list we just had someone want s|.*'/'||

[01:49] <timotimo> that'd totally work as just a substr with an rindex

[02:22] <kalkin-> hi #perl6

[02:22] <kalkin-> How do i read from a file descriptor which I obtained from a native call?

[02:23] <timotimo> well, you can definitely use nativecall for regular libc functions like fprintf

[02:24] <timotimo> we do have a "give me the native descriptor for this perl6-level IO thingie"

[02:24] <timotimo> not sure about the other side

[02:24] <timotimo> well, you can "/proc/self/fd/$num".IO.open(...)

[02:24] <timotimo> but only on linux

[02:24] <kalkin-> timotimo: i think the other side is missing

[02:25] <kalkin-> timotimo: TIL about fd/$num

[02:26] <kalkin-> timotimo: is linux only anyway, thanks!

[02:26] <kalkin-> timotimo: is linux only anyway, thanks!

[02:43] <timotimo> well, accessing it from a different thread surely won't work

[02:43] <timotimo> how were you checking for it?

[08:38] <samcv> it's basically like \s+ when you have a space when doing sigspace

[08:38] <samcv> well

[08:38] <samcv> m: say 'blah' ~~ /:s blah/

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «｢blah｣␤»

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «｢blah｣␤»

[08:38] <samcv> that still matches though?

[08:39] <samcv> so it's like \s* at the last token but like \s+ on others?

[08:39] <samcv> m: say 'blah' ~~ /:s b lah /

[10:43] *** bwisti joined
[10:43] <masak> like, say you just defined a new operator in your program. now you've technically extended the language with that operator.

[10:43] <masak> that's like adding one little thread (your operator) to an already quite woven-together braid (Perl 6)

[10:44] <masak> ZzZombo: the reason Perl 6 needs to invent a fairly new term for this is that it's trying to do something other languages are not (as far as I'm aware)

[10:45] <masak> the thing it's trying is something like having the cake and eating it wrt everyone being able to extend the language while also minimally colliding with everyone else in doing so

[10:45] <ZzZombo> well then

[10:46] <masak> the closest thing in Perl 5 is something called "source filters". I know next to nothing about them, but I can say with certainty that they are not famous for their *composability*

[10:47] <masak> I've gotten the eerie feeling that source filters are not very far removed from being regex-manipulations on source text -- someone feel free to enlighten me further on that point

[10:47] <masak> hm, I wonder if someone has ever done something like source filters, but with PPI as a foundation :)

[10:48] <masak> does PPI round-trip back to source text?

[10:50] <ZzZombo> HELP! I'm here watching my cursor suddenly moving by itself towards the right bottom corner....

[10:50] <ZzZombo> I am not holding the mouse and its resting on its pad

[10:51] <ZzZombo> it's greased, there is no way it can somehow start to move by itself...

[10:51] <masak> how long since you performed the Mousa Calibration Ritual?

[10:51] <masak> Mouse*

[10:51] <ZzZombo> what is that? Is that some thing related to the old devices with a track ball inside them?

[10:52] <masak> maybe you need to reboot your fridge or toaster of they're IoT devices. they might interfere with the mouse.

[10:52] <ZzZombo> WTF, this is so creepy.

[10:53] <araraloren> ...

[10:56] <masak> maybe it's your neighbor who has hacked the mouse. you did password-protect your mouse, right?

[10:56] <ZzZombo> hunter2

[10:56] <masak> all I see is asterisks

[10:56] <ZzZombo> see, it works.

[10:57] <masak> oh, that was a password? great!

[11:08] <IOninja> wtf

[11:08] <masak> ZzZombo: I know TimToady and possibly jnthn have been making braid-related Rakudo commits lately, but I don't know what prompted it

[11:09] <IOninja> RabidGravy: that code looks insane to me. What's with the 0 xx * bit?

[11:09] <RabidGravy> dunno

[11:09] <IOninja> RabidGravy: also, that's the wrong commit. The fix is in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/51b0aba

[11:10] <masak> `0 xx *` just means "a fair amount of zeros" :)

[11:10] *** cibs left
[11:10] <IOninja> RabidGravy: and why eager the fetchall? You'd think that to be a heavy operation that can benefit greatly from not fetching everything at the same time

[11:10] <IOninja> masak: ... which aren't used in that code.

[11:11] <RabidGravy> hence "naive fix"

[11:12] <masak> huh.

[11:12] <IOninja> masak: my thoughts exactl.y

[11:12] <masak> if you mean that they aren't used for the .map, that just means that the `0` could've been anything

[11:12] *** cibs joined
[11:13] <IOninja> like repeat...until? Sure.

[11:13] <masak> basically.

[11:13] <RabidGravy> I didn't write the code, I'm sure whoever did had their reasons

[11:16] <RabidGravy> it wasn't lazy before due to the flat losing the laziness so I was just preserving the tested behaviour

[11:16] <IOninja> It was lazy.

[11:17] <IOninja> star: my $x = (0 xx *).flat; say $x[^10]

[12:06] <jnthn> We used to generate this error by default

[12:06] <jnthn> e.g. there was a default FAILGOAL that did "Cannot find ]" or so

[12:06] <andrzejku> hi people :)

[12:07] <sena_kun> jnthn, this default will be returned on some point or I can document it as "do it yourself"?

[12:07] <jnthn> And pepole whined "oh but every other regex construct backtracks, why not this one", so we ended up changing it...

[12:07] <jnthn> I suggest providing an example like the one IOninja just gave

[12:08] <sena_kun> jnthn, FAILGOAL works only for ~ or is it a default method for failure errors in general?

[12:09] <sena_kun> jnthn, noted. Thanks, folks, I'll finish it faster now.

[12:46] <masak> I remember arguing the point in an RT ticket somewhere

[12:47] <masak> I think what stood out to me was that grammars already have a composable kind of failure mechanism (backtracking), and this one thing incongruously used exceptions instead

[12:48] <stmuk_> I think all the slangs in the ecosystem are broken now

[12:49] <stmuk_> is braid getting moved to 6.d?

[13:02] <DrForr> Afternoon, sammers.

[13:02] <stmuk_> slangs aren't documented either so I guess its not really supported yet

[13:50] <tbrowder> hi, sena_kun

[13:51] <tbrowder> my question for today involves initializing and assigning to arrays

[13:55] <gfldex> you can do it if you assign a Pair of Str and Array in the initialiser

[14:39] <tbrowder> my examples have been with one key, but the need is for a basic hash of arrays, one mutable array per hash key

[14:40] <tbrowder> how can that most painlessly and correctly be created incrementally? anyone?

[14:41] <tbrowder> in p5 terms i believe: an HoA

[14:44] <SmokeMachine> m: dd a => 4; dd 'a' => 4 # why?

[14:46] <gfldex> tbrowder: ^^^

[14:48] <gfldex> SmokeMachine: yes

[14:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {}␤»

[14:49] <gfldex> i did expect it to add the Pair to the Hash.

[14:49] <timotimo> SmokeMachine: because a => 4 is a named parameter and 'a' => 4 is a pair literal that'll be put into a positional parameter

[14:49] <SmokeMachine> m: my %h; %h.push('A' => 1); %h.push('B' => 2); %h.push('A' => 3); dd %h;

[14:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {:A($[1, 3]), :B(2)}␤»

[14:50] <SmokeMachine> timotimo: ok, that makes sense...

[14:50] <gfldex> timotimo: as stated in the docs :->

[14:51] <SmokeMachine> gfldex: I didn't read everything... thanks... :(

[14:51] <timotimo> yup, the docs say that

[14:52] <timotimo> it's a common gotcha, especially for .push :)

[14:52] <gfldex> luckily it wasn't me who wrote that

[14:52] <timotimo> sooo, do the docs actually tell about s{abc} = "def"? i couldn't find anything about that form when i was answering that question on the users mailing list

[14:52] * IOninja recalls writing that

[14:53] <gfldex> timotimo: it's not in the docs because it's not in roast

[14:53] <SmokeMachine> Couldn't the hash's push receive named parameters and act as it was positional pairs? I'm not sure if it's a good idea...

[14:53] <IOninja> timotimo: last code example: https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#s///_in-place_substitution

[14:55] <gfldex> SmokeMachine: it could but then loads of ppl would not learn about the named-argument rule on Method

[14:55] <DrForr> My mistake there, I'm afraid.

[14:55] <tbrowder>  ok, but why is, in my examples, %r<a>, not an array var?

[14:56] <SmokeMachine> gfldex: thanks!

[14:56] <IOninja> SmokeMachine: it'd make it much slower, lock us out from adding any options to the routine later on, and this quirk is present in literally all method calls, so adding support for that just in push is a drop in a bucket

[14:56] <IOninja> tbrowder: which example exactly?

[14:56] <SmokeMachine> IOninja: thanks!

[14:57] <timotimo> OK, so there's a line in one of the examples... it's not very visible, though. like, it's not pointed out at all that that example is going to be presenting such a different syntax out of the blue

[14:57] <IOninja> timotimo: well, it is, kinda. The last sentence is all about that syntax.

[14:58] <timotimo> also: how the heck do we put it into the index?

[14:58] <timotimo> i'd like it to have a heading of its own

[14:59] <tbrowder> IOninja: my %r<a>; %r<a>.push: 'a'; # repeat push one or more times...

[14:59] <timotimo> but "my %r<a>" doesn't even work?

[15:00] <tbrowder>  so no simple way to incrementally create a p6 HoA?, not good pr

[15:01] <timotimo> of course there is?

[15:02] <timotimo> what's wrong with this?

[15:02] <tbrowder> but there needs at least needs to be a good example in the docs which i'm happy to add if i knew how to make one :)

[15:02] <IOninja> tbrowder: well, you keep using my %r<a> even though it's been pointed out to you that's not correct syntax.

[15:04] <IOninja> tbrowder: which one keeps pushing to the first element?

[15:04] <tbrowder>  sorry, but isn't that what timotimo just did?

[15:04] <timotimo> no

[15:04] <timotimo> i used "my %h"

[15:04] <pmurias> n "my %r<a>;" is the part that does not work

[15:05] <timotimo> "my %h<foo>" would (in the future, when we've implemented that) be a declaration for a hash that only accepts the key "foo" and will never accept any other key

[15:05] <tbrowder> oh, slapping forehead,...gross series of typos

[15:06] <tbrowder> let me try again:

[15:06] <timotimo> oh, i think i see what your problem is

[15:06] <timotimo> m: my %h; %h<a>.push(1); %h<a>.push(2); my @a = %h<a>; my @b = @%h<a>; dd @a, @b;

[15:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [[1, 2],]␤Array @b = [Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "Type Seq does not support associative indexing."), backtrace => Backtrace.new)]␤»

[15:06] <timotimo> whoops %)

[15:07] <timotimo> m: my %h; %h<a>.push(1); %h<a>.push(2); my @a = %h<a>; my @b = @(%h<a>); dd @a, @b;

[15:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [[1, 2],]␤Array @b = [1, 2]␤»

[15:07] <timotimo> tbrowder: your mistake was that the arrays in the hash are in an itemized container, so when you assigned to @a with "my @a = %h<a>" you were only putting a single item into @a

[15:07] <timotimo> and you interpreted that as if %h<a> was a list with a list as its first element

[15:08] <tbrowder> m: my %r; %r<a>.push: 'a'; %r<a>.push: '3'; say %r<a>.perl

[16:07] <tbrowder>  timotimo: my examples today were very shortened from the code i'm working with. here today we could see the array form with the say .perl syntax, but in my real code i was seeing just a string concatenation of the array contents. i vaguely remember having the same problem last year but unpacking the array in code took some magic...don't know what best

[16:07] <tbrowder> practice is but i was creating a var like this: my @d = %r<a> which gave a single string but this works: my @d = @(%r<a>) which gave me the array elements

[16:17] <IOninja> tbrowder: no referencing or dereferencing involved. %r<a> array is itemized, so you're providing just 1 item to @a. The `@` is a coercer, not dereferencer. You could also slip with `|

[16:21] <tbrowder>  IOninja: thanks, that helps understand the array some better, i have to say the docs probaby could introduce arrays a little gentler, at least for me, haven't gotten head wrapped around itemization yet

[16:24] <IOninja> If you have to boxes of crayons and I tell you to put one in the other, there are two ways to interpret it: shove the entire box into the other (so you retain information about the crayons inside of it) or move the crayons themselves, discarding one box. The former is itemization—treating something as one thing—the latter is the slipping of one array into another: you end up with one homogenous set of

[16:24] <IOninja> elements.

[16:24] <IOninja> *two boxes

[16:26] <IOninja> m: my @box1 = <a b c>; my @box2 = <d e f>; @box1.push: @box2; say @box1

[16:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar b9332a: OUTPUT: «[a b c [d e f]]␤»

[16:58] <tbrowder>  sounds like a page turner!

[16:59] <sena_kun> tbrowder, glad to hear it!

[17:01] <tbrowder> sena_kun: the pr 1187 looks ok to me, too. have you figured out the conflict?

[17:01] <tbrowder> maybe try splitting into smaller prs

[17:02] <sena_kun> tbrowder, it was my edits for output style, so I can fix it easily. The new web editor is very handy too.

[17:33] <stmuk_> well the footer says its generated from a repo it isn't

[17:34] <stmuk_> I was git greping perl/doc but its a different repo

[17:36] <IOninja> probably just a copy-paste of a page that used to be in docs but was taken down for Christmas because we never finalized slangs API

[17:38] *** pyrimidine joined
[17:42] <stmuk_> I don't think the content was actually ever in the docs repo itself but generally yes

[17:51] <timotimo> no, you misread the footer

[17:51] <timotimo> "using htmlify.p6 from perl6/doc on github"

[17:52] <timotimo> that's the intended bracketing for that phrase

[17:53] <regnarg> Plans for a Perl6 chromium-based web browser: https://github.com/regnarg/perl6-cef Currently it doesn't do much apart from initializing the CEF using NativeCall but it's a start...

[17:54] <IOninja> cool

[17:54] <travis-ci> Doc build errored. Altai-man 'Merge branch 'master' into grammar'

[17:54] *** travis-ci left
[17:54] *** ChoHag left
[17:56] <regnarg> It might need some improvements to NativeCall, I think it's currently not possible to put function pointers to structs, which half of the CEF API is comprised of. But some callback code is in NativeCall already and shouldn't be hard to adapt.

[17:58] <timotimo> i think you can nativecast a pointer to a function by giving a signature or something like that

[18:00] <regnarg> I will more often need the opposite: put a pointer to a Perl6 function (callback) into a struct. I'm not sure whether it can be currently done with some casting because it requires generating a C wrapper function. But the required infrastructure is already there because you can already pass Perl6 callbacks as arguments to C functions (at least the docs say so).

[18:00] <timotimo> nativecall does the c wrapper thing for you

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> m: my @manna = :a1, :b2, :c3; dd @manna

[18:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 254f76: OUTPUT: «Array @manna = [:a1, :b2, :c3]␤»

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> m: my @manna = :a1 :b2 :c3; dd @manna

[18:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 254f76: OUTPUT: «Array @manna = [:a1]␤»

[18:01] <AlexDaniel> hm

[18:01] <timotimo> you might have to create a function that takes a pointer and immediately returns it to appease nativecall?

[18:01] <RabidGravy> I think there is support for callable attributes in CSTructs

[18:01] <IOninja> There's a ticket for that.

[18:01] <regnarg> That might run into problems with the lifetime of the C wrapper

[18:02] <AlexDaniel> regnarg: nice!

[18:02] <regnarg> It might get freed after the function returns

[18:02] <regnarg> Specifically you cannot just keep a void pointer around because NativeCall would not know when to free the wrapper

[18:03] <regnarg> So my guess is that some (possibly simple) changes to NativeCall would be needed.

[18:03] <regnarg> But I might be wrong, haven't yet looked into the details.

[18:03] <timotimo> no, the wrappers leak

[18:03] <IOninja> AlexDaniel: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129143#ticket-history and https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127143#ticket-history and https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127134#ticket-history

[18:03] <timotimo> they get freed at end of life at the moment

[18:03] <IOninja> more or less

[18:03] <regnarg> Ok, in that case it might just happen to work

[18:04] <regnarg> Even though it's probably not a robust solution in the long term

[18:04] <timotimo> right, something clever is needed

[18:04] <regnarg> I'll try that sometime soon

[18:04] <timotimo> you want to just pass an anonymous block to a c function and not worry about it

[18:04] <AlexDaniel> IOninja: so add RT #130816 to the list? :)

[18:04] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=130816

[18:04] <timotimo> but you'll have to also assign it to a variable and manually free it at some point with some kind of API that we'll have to design

[18:05] <AlexDaniel> not sure if I will ever be able to use chromium-based anything because it never respected my system settings, but this looks like a great project :)

[18:06] *** mspo left
[18:06] <regnarg> Chromium has a very good core (w.r.t. speed and security) but it UI and especially configurability is horrendous.

[18:07] <regnarg> But the CEF API is quite flexible (you can intercept every key event, every request, and so on) so one should be able to build something more flexible atop it.

[18:15] <robertle> i have some functionality i want to put in a module, but I sometimes need it exposed in an OO fashion, sometimes procedurally. I could put both in the same module, but is that a terrible idea? so you would "use MuStuff" which would give you a role "MyStuff" as well as a sub my-stuff

[18:15] *** agentzh joined
[18:15] <robertle> alternatively these could be two modules, e.g. Role::MyStuff and Module::MyStuff... not sure what is worse

[18:17] <DrForr> I'd do the export module and have it be just a wrapper to methods in the main module.

[18:20] <RabidGravy> yeah

[18:20] <robertle> so two modules, the OO one wrapping thje procedural one?

[18:23] <regnarg> Alternatively, you can use the export groups functionality

[18:23] <regnarg> Or sets or how it is called

[18:24] <regnarg> https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Exporting_and_Selective_Importing

[18:25] <regnarg> and then the user does either    use MyModule :oop;   or use MyModule :procedural;   or even use MyModule :ALL;

[18:25] <regnarg> It might be cleaner than two modules but it depends on the specifics

[18:25] <robertle> oh wow, that sounds great I'll do that!

[18:26] <robertle> specifics: it's like "Pluggable"

[19:52] <moritz> and some magic in htmlify to make that happen

[23:57] <tbrowder> btw, i can't remember ever using escapes in a shell command, ever, in or out of perl 5 or 6.  btw, glad to see p6 mkdir defaults to the -p arg that p5 didn't last time i looked.  that was one thing that always made me go to shell.
