[00:26] <ugexe> re: $*THREAD.id - I dont know how evans was creating his threads, but if he was using `start { }` then its totally expectable to get the same $*THREAD.id since that only schedules code to be run

[00:27] <perlawhirl> .tell lizmat I'm not sure I'm an authority :D The docs say a Mix is like a Bag, so my opinion is it should behave similar to bags, ie: False.

[10:40] <Zoffix> "we do have something that makes sure dynamic variables from where you called start will stick around for the inside of the start block"

[10:41] <Zoffix> It's the $*PROMISE dynvar whose $!dynamic_context is set to the context of pre-cue code. Recently-ish (~2017.06) there was a bug where .then wasn't setting it, though I took care for look for all other cases in Promise.pm that failed to set it and I think they all do now.

[10:42] <Zoffix> And &DYNAMIC looks to see if there's a $*PROMISE dynvar if get getlexdyn fails (and lastly looks in PROCESS::)

[10:44] *** wamba joined
[10:46] <timotimo> but does the dynamic_context of the $*PROMISE not keep the old $*THREAD alive?

[10:48] <Zoffix> I see a $*THREAD made when Thread gets created

[10:48] <Zoffix> I've not seen the code that shows it not being updated or whatever...

[10:50] <Zoffix> perhaps OP assumed each `start` would have a unique thread.id

[10:52] <timotimo> i wrote some code that prints the $*THREAD.id as well as the $_ for the task created

[10:52] <timotimo> and it gave me lots of different thread id -> $_ combinations

[10:52] <Zoffix> What's $

[10:52] <Zoffix> ?

[10:52] <timotimo> just from the for loop i used to create 20 tasks

[10:53] *** mr-foobar left
[10:53] <Zoffix> There's only 16 threads, so yeah, the ids would repeat

[10:53] *** gregf_ joined
[10:54] *** broquaint joined

[10:54] *** mr-foobar joined

[12:49] <Morfent> quick question, is does perl6 support freebsd? rakudo and pugs ports have been deleted for years now, and parrot apparently no longer targets perl6

[12:50] <Morfent> *does perl6 support freebsd

[12:51] <Zoffix> rakudo is the lastest game in town. Whether it supports freebsd is really a question of whether there's any volunteers willing to ensure that support. I think someone was trying that out not so long ago; unsure what the end result was

[12:53] <llfourn> I'm pretty sure you can build it on fbsd

[12:53] <Zoffix> You could try compiling from sauce: git clone https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/ ~/.perl6; cd ~/.perl6; perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar; make; make test; make install; 

[12:53] <llfourn> (not sure if there's a port though)

[12:53] <Zoffix> and adding ~/.perl6/install/bin to PATH and runnign with perl6

[12:54] *** pierre__ joined
[12:55] <Morfent> there is no port

[12:55] <Morfent> i'll try that though

[12:55] <Morfent> thanks

[12:58] *** mcmillhj joined
[12:58] <perlpilot> Morfent: you might want to use rakudobrew if you want something that takes care of the details for you.

[12:59] <Zoffix> *sigh*

[12:59] *** awwaiid joined
[12:59] *** domidumont1 joined
[13:00] <Zoffix> You don't want rakudobrew, unless you plan to use multiple versions of rakudo at the same time.

[13:01] <Zoffix> And it requires doing extra stuff like rehashing after installing binaries that you normally don't need to do

[13:01] <stmuk_> perl6 worked fine on FreeBSD last time I tried it

[13:01] *** Zoffix left

[13:04] <nicq20> Comments are considered part of whitespace right?

[13:04] <llfourn> by the compiler? yes.

[13:05] <lizmat> fg

[13:07] <nicq20> Well that explains why my stuff is not working then.

[13:08] <Morfent> i don't think rakudobrew's something i entirely need

[13:08] <llfourn> nicq20: what kind of stuff is that?

[13:09] *** broquaint left
[13:09] <nicq20> I'm trying to emulate the P5 module Smart::Comments. The idea is that comments beginning with >3 '#' will be displayed.

[13:10] <llfourn> ah, for that you'll need to modify the compiler with a slang. Is that what you're doing?

[13:10] *** broquaint joined
[13:11] <nicq20> llfourn: Yeah, this is what I have so far: https://github.com/nicqrocks/perl6-smart-comments

[13:13] <llfourn> hmm what you did looks like it should work :\

[13:13] <nicq20> llfourn: By calling the regex 'comment:sym<smc>' it gets called, but the QAST returned is never executed. If I call it 'statement_control:sym<smc>' then it never gets called due to the compiler seeing it as whitespace.

[13:13] <llfourn> ahhhh

[13:14] <llfourn> yep that makes sense

[13:14] <nicq20> Really not sure how to get aroun that. :/

[13:14] <nicq20> *around

[13:15] <llfourn> well...I'm pretty sure there's a $*CURPAD or something variable

[13:15] <llfourn> you could append your QAST into it perhaps

[13:15] <llfourn> though YMMV

[13:16] <nicq20> What is that?

[13:16] <llfourn> it's the current QAST::Block object ie lexical scope

[13:16] <llfourn> the things that are in it will be executed. Each statement appends to one.

[13:16] <nicq20> What about YMMV?

[13:17] <llfourn> your milage may vary

[13:17] <llfourn> # YMMV is a thing right?

[13:18] *** colomon joined
[13:19] <moritz> it is

[13:20] <llfourn> ah nice.

[13:21] *** colomon left
[13:24] <nicq20> Are there any docs/examples on how to use it? I can't seem to find it in Rakudo or NQP.

[13:24] <llfourn> definetly not

[13:25] <llfourn> but you can .push onto it and I think that will work

[13:25] <llfourn> maybe if it doesn't try wrapping your QAST in a QAST::Stmts

[13:26] <llfourn> so $*CURPAD.push(QAST::Op.new(...)) # or whatever

[13:26] <nicq20> Ah, ok.

[13:26] <llfourn> though I've never tried this and it might be a terrible idea

[13:29] <nicq20> Hmm... Looks like it does not have a `.push` method.

[13:29] <nicq20> "of type NQPMu"

[13:29] <llfourn> $*CURPAD is NQPMu?

[13:31] <llfourn> nicq20: you might try looking at Actions.nqp

[13:31] <llfourn> there are some places where $*CURPAD/QAST::Block are used

[13:31] <nicq20> I am, but there are examples of using `.push` with $*CURPAD.

[13:46] <evanm> Hi, I would like to contribute information to the bug tracker, but I can't seem to find a way.

[13:46] <AlexDaniel> huggable: rakudobug

[13:46] <huggable> AlexDaniel, Report bugs by emailing to [email@hidden.address]
[13:47] <AlexDaniel> evanm: just send an email to this address ↑, that's if you want to file a bug report

[13:47] <evanm> I would like to comment on an existing bug.

[13:47] <AlexDaniel> ah-ha, then… there are two options

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> I think one is to write an email to [email@hidden.address] and include this in your subject: [perl #131722]

[13:49] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131722

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> where instead of 131722 you write the actual ticket number

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> or, you can create a bitcard account, and then you'll be able to write a comment directly on the website

[13:49] *** Cabanossi left
[13:50] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Thanks. I have already created a bitcard account, but the "Reply" and "Comment" links don't seem to work.

[13:50] <AlexDaniel> evanm: hmm, what do you see when you click them?

[13:51] <evanm> I get a mostly blank page with the message "This service is sponsored and maintained by Best Practical Solutions and runs on Perl.org infrastructure."

[13:51] *** gfldex left
[13:51] <AlexDaniel> evanm: can you see anything at all when you're logged in?

[13:52] *** Cabanossi joined
[13:52] <evanm> fwiw the page has no opening <html> tag, <head>, etc

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> evanm: for some reason some newly created accounts are experiencing this bug and we don't know why, yet…

[13:52] <evanm> AlexDaniel: I can see the bugs but it says "Welcome anonymous guest" at the top

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> ah wait, but then you're not logged in?

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> click “login as another user”, what happens next?

[13:53] <evanm> AlexDaniel: I appear to be logged in

[13:53] *** nadim joined
[13:53] <evanm> AlexDaniel: If I log out, the "About" page includes information about Bitcard

[13:54] <evanm> AlexDaniel: If I log in, the information about bitcard disappears

[13:55] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Rather, the gray "Login" box disappears, the yellow box about Bitcard is still there

[13:55] *** ab6tract joined
[13:55] <AlexDaniel> evanm: hm, I think a screenshot would help a lot, but I have a feeling that you're experiencing the bug mentioned above

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> although what you see is slightly different…

[13:56] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Oh, I think I figured it out

[13:57] <evanm> AlexDaniel: I had a bitcard account but had not finished creating a "Persona"

[13:57] <nicq20> llfourn: I think it's not working because $*CURPAD does not exist in the comments scope.

[13:58] *** W4RL0RD left
[13:59] *** araraloren left
[13:59] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Now when I am logged in I see "My open tickets" (empty) but no way to browse the bugs.

[14:00] <evanm> AlexDaniel: If I enter a specific bug number, I get the message "No permission to display that ticket"

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> evanm: like this? https://files.progarm.org/2016-02-05-021403_666x501_scrot.png

[14:03] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Yes.

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> evanm: okay, *now* we are seeing the bug I was talking about :)

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> evanm: just drop an email to [email@hidden.address] saying that your account is broken, and of course include the information about your account

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> evanm: oh also

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> evanm: in your email, say that it is associated with #127461

[14:06] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127461

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> (which is the internal ticket ID for the same problem I had a year ago)

[14:07] <AlexDaniel> evanm: I know it's confusing, sorry for the trouble.

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> in fact, I have a feeling that there are more people experiencing this problem, but they probably give up completely and don't even reach this channel…

[14:08] <AlexDaniel> so in the end we have only a couple of documented cases, uh…

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> mst, [Coke]: is there anything we can do about this? ↑

[14:09] <AlexDaniel> that's *at least* the fourth time I see somebody get into this trouble

[14:11] <mst> odd

[14:12] <mst> so this is "newly created bitcard accounts sometimes don't get any permissions" ?

[14:15] *** nadim left
[14:16] <evanm> mst: I also hit an issue where a half-created bitcard account (without a "Persona") led to a buggy experience in the RT... maybe related?

[14:16] <evanm> AlexDaniel: Ok, I sent a message to perlbug-admin about not having permissions

[14:20] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I can do nothing about it other than refer people to ping the bug admins, as you did.

[14:21] *** ab6tract left
[14:21] <mst> might be worth trying to convince them to consider there's a general bug rather than just fixing stuff one at a time

[14:33] <evanm> Speaking of new user issues, the issue I was going to comment on is #131025. Rakudo Star's p6doc is broken on OSX; it appears to be because the DMG does not ship with any pod files / "doc" directories.

[14:33] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131025

[14:34] <evanm> Would be great if the Keeper of the Star could take a look at this issue, as it's a pretty significant usability problem for Mac users

[15:20] <evanm> Hi, is Rakudo's Configure supposed to accept "--with-moar="? INSTALL.txt indicates that it should work, but the script doesn't recognize the option

[15:21] <stmuk_> evanm: I know what the problem is (not OS X specific) and its now fixed if you upgrade p6doc

[15:22] <evanm> stmuk_: Great, thanks. I worked around the issue by symlinking .perl6/doc to a checkout of perl6/doc

[15:23] <Zoffix> evanm: doesn't look like it: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/Configure.pl#L35-L42

[15:25] <mst> I thought rakudo's configure took maybe --with-nqp ?

[15:25] * mst needs to go back and see how much of the crazy involved in his cpan dist prototypes is still required

[15:25] <mst> and actually upload the bloody things

[15:25] <Zoffix> yeah, but not --with-moar looks like

[15:25] <mst> well NQP is tied to the moar so surely it should find the moar from the NQP ?

[15:25] <mst> in theory

[15:25] <jnthn> Rakudo depends on nqp, not MoarVM directly

[15:26] <mst> it may still not be exactly *good* at doing that, but that should theoretically work

[16:07] <geekosaur> most systems have a limit to how deeply you can nest #! lines

[16:07] <geekosaur> on linux that limit is fairly high; on *BSD (including OS X) it's low

[16:08] <geekosaur> so at some point the exec fails and the shell's fallback path interprets it

[18:41] <evanm> Hi, I have a question about wrapping C libraries

[18:42] <evanm> Is there a preferred convention for Enum values? Let's say in C there's something like:

[18:42] <evanm>  enum { LXW_CHART_LINE, LXW_CHART_SCATTER }

[18:43] <evanm> I'm curious whether I should make the Perl 6 API "enum Chart <line scatter>" or "enum Chart <LXW_CHART_LINE LXW_CHART_SCATTER>"

[18:44] <evanm> (or even <lxw-chart-line lxw-chart-scatter>)

[18:44] <timotimo> yeah that's a good question

[18:44] <timotimo> i have no good answer to

[18:47] <evanm> e.g. it doesn't seem to like "enum Chart <line scatter>" and "enum Shape <line rectangle>" in the same scope

[18:48] <geekosaur> I think that's expected, yes, since the enum values get exported into the main namespace

[18:48] <geekosaur> although arguably it should be a warning and then require qualification on names

[23:09] <kybr> anyone have pointers on setting up callbacks with c libraries and NativeCall?

[23:10] *** dubi0us left
[23:16] <timotimo> we have a few projects that do it

[23:16] <timotimo> and there's tests in t/nativecall under rakudo that also show how it's done

[23:16] <timotimo> kybr: ^

[23:17] <timotimo> GTK::Simple has callbacks, for example. the async SSH one does, too

[23:27] <kybr> timotimo: thanks. that's just what i wanted.

[23:33] <kybr> MoarVM panic: Internal error: Unwound entire stack and missed handler :(

[23:35] <geekosaur> you have to handle perl 6 errors including Failures inside your callback; there's nothing to do with them otherwise because C has no clue what they even are

[23:36] <geekosaur> (note that Nil is a delayed silent 'exception' and Failure is a delayed noisy one)

[23:45] <timotimo> yeah, there's nothing in C that moarvm could cooperate with to do stack unwinding and cleanup. the C code you were calling that called you back, it could have done all sorts of things on the stack, like it could assume its stack frame would live a bit longer and pass some pointers to the stack around

[23:46] <timotimo> not to mention resources allocated between oyu calling it and it calling you back. that's buffers malloced, sockets created or other kinds of files opened ...

[23:46] <timotimo> anyway, bedtime
