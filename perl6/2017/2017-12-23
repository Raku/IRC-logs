[00:46] <kilobyte> Hi! (Not even a perl6 user yet, messing with fonts); I just learned perl6 uses ï½¢ï½£ in its preferred syntax.  Are there other such characters that are unlikely to be found in minimal fonts?

[00:51] <kilobyte> I mean, stuff that's not merely allowed (like ğŒ²ğ‰ğŒ¸ğŒ¹c identifiers in perl5 with "use utf8"), just ones that are likely to be found in real non-fancy code

[01:05] <kilobyte> AlexDaniel: default glyph set for the console on Debian looks like it has been last visited in the previous millenium, it could use a refresh

[01:05] <kilobyte> AlexDaniel: also, x terminal font authors need to be told which glyphs to prioritize

[01:06] <kilobyte> I mean, in my current font ï½¢ï½£ look nice when borrowed from other fonts, âš› spills over taking almost two positions

[01:07] <geekosaur> X11 stuff defers that to your .fontconfig

[01:07] <geekosaur> and terminals intrinsically have no good way to deal with character widths

[01:07] <kilobyte> I can set this up on my personal machine, yeah -- but 99.99% of users don't know how

[01:09] <kilobyte> geekosaur: right, I asked for clarification, which resulted in the yellow text on https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/tr11-34.html (will need another iteration to request a table which _is_ intended for use)

[02:19] <geekosaur> CPAN is CPAN. CPAN supports both perl 5 and perl 6. CPAN is not modules.perl6.org. I think modules.perl6.org is transitional and you'd use metacpan.org or similar instead eventually

[03:15] <Zoffix> It's not quite the plan any more. The metacpan fork was limping all along and last time I got the update about it it was "stalled but not yet dead", which is why CPAN support was added to mp6o. My crystal ball says mp6o's featureset will slightly develop further for ~2 years, then there'll be move to write proper Rakudo version of the site. Perl 5 version just isn't working out, the way I see it.

[03:15] <Zoffix> manchicken, CPAN is CPAN. It has support for both Pumpkin Perl 5 and Rakudo Perl 6 modules. It's one of our ecosystems, with the other being GitHub/GitLab based, called "p6c". The modules.perl6.org ("mp6o") is the front-end for both of those ecosystems

[03:16] <manchicken> Aww... I like metacpan.

[03:30] <Zoffix> manchicken: this one in particular is in high demand: https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org/issues/81

[03:30] *** konsolebox joined
[03:32] <manchicken> So much to do.

[03:33] <manchicken> Was going to implement Fcntl in p6.

[03:33] <manchicken> Trying to determine approach. Thinking that I'd make a C program to print the constants to a module that can be pulled in by the Perl 6 module.

[03:34] <manchicken> I could use NativeCall, but it seems silly.

[03:34] <manchicken> But do we think that the mp6o's stuff is higher priority?

[03:35] <Zoffix> briefly glancing at Fcntl's perldoc, doesn't look like something I'd ever need. there's .lock and .seek on IO::Handle. Dunno what else Fcntl does

[03:35] *** konsolebox left
[03:36] <Zoffix> https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org/issues/81 is kinda high priority in that P6Weekly used to always include new module releases, but now it doesn't because we got to ecosystem and whatnot and the Recent Modules page would be handy for Weekly and whatnot.

[03:37] *** konsolebox joined
[03:38] <manchicken> Fcntl gives you your standard C constants.

[03:38] <Zoffix> Ah, I don't know C

[03:38] <manchicken> Modules like open2/open3 use it.

[03:38] <manchicken> It's a foundational module.

[03:41] <manchicken> A bunch of the modules on the wishlist—at least in their P5 implementation—use Fcntl.

[14:28] <psychoslave> Hi, I'm interesting with Perl6 "slang" facilities that I have heard of, but I don't find introducing documentation. I'm looking at this within a broader research on [programming language internationalization](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Internationalisation_of_Programming_Languages) I just started. I would like to know if Perl6's slangs could be used for this purpose. Notably, I would like to know if this facility: 1. enable

[14:28] <psychoslave>  to modify even reseverved keywords 2. expose the same debugging/profiling features as the native Perl6 language, or if it operate a kind of transpiler work which won't enable to track the additional layer.

[14:28] <psychoslave> Your feedback will be highly appreciated, thank you.

[14:29] *** piojo_ joined
[14:42] <timotimo> psychoslave: yes, you can change even reserved keywords, though hardly anything in perl6 is really reserved in that sense

[14:43] <timotimo> https://github.com/bduggan/mosdef - here's an example slang that allows you to use "lambda" or Î» to declare anonymous subs

[14:43] <timotimo> and "def" to declare methods

[14:49] <psychoslave> thank you timotimo that's an excellent feedback for me

[14:50] <timotimo> search "slang" in modules.perl6.org to find more; v5 is an extremely thorough slang, replacing basically all of perl6 with perl5, but it has bitrotted so you can't run it on a current rakudo

[14:52] <psychoslave> on a side note, I found you nickname doubly [frightening](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/timo#Esperanto) ^^

[14:53] <timotimo> yeah, i believe the original name would have been "timotheus", which means god-fearing

[14:53] <timotimo> "the god-fearing one"

[14:53] <lizmat> .oO( intimodating )

[14:54] <timotimo> this isn't a timo dating community :P

[14:56] <psychoslave> Otherwise, I'm interested with more technical details with how all that is architectured. Is the perl6 default syntax also a slang?

[14:57] <psychoslave> From what I can infer from v5 being a slang, I guess one could possibly integrate any programming language as a slang of perl6, is that so?

[14:58] <timotimo> basically

[14:58] <timotimo> perl6 is parsed with a Grammar and an Actions class (plus the World that holds all definition-like things)

[14:58] <timotimo> you make a slang by either replacing the grammar entirely or mixing in a role into the existing grammar

[14:58] <lizmat> one of the exercises in the rakudo internals course, is an implementation of PHP  :-)

[14:58] <lizmat> and people *have* worked on doing Ruby, afaik

[14:58] <timotimo> you see, Grammar is really class-like, so you can derive from a grammar, and you can mix into a grammar

[15:00] <psychoslave> Very interesting. Is Rakudo coded in C?  

[15:01] *** comborico1611 joined
[15:01] <timotimo> no, we have a language called NQP which is "Not Quite Perl6" that we use to bootstrap rakudo

[15:01] <timotimo> nqp already has full perl6 grammars built in

[15:02] <timotimo> a lot of rakudo is written in NQP, but the "core setting", i.e. almost all built-in classes and subs (including operators), are written in perl6

[15:02] <psychoslave> By the way, don't be shy on giving me many links, I will put them on the references of the research of language i18n :)

[15:02] <timotimo> nqp runs on MoarVM, the JVM, and (work ongoing) JavaScript

[15:02] <psychoslave> impressive

[15:03] <timotimo> and MoarVM is written in C

[15:07] *** aindilis left
[15:12] *** mingdao left
[15:13] <psychoslave> also, there is no "reserved keyword" timotimo, does it mean that `sub` might easily be used as an other keyword or as an identifier in in a slang?

[15:14] <timotimo> m: my \sub = 1; say sub

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 729caa8f1: OUTPUT: Â«5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>â¤Missing blockâ¤at <tmp>:1â¤------> 3my \sub = 1; say sub7â5<EOL>â¤    expecting any of:â¤        new name to be definedâ¤Â»

[15:14] <psychoslave> I mean, it deals collision with clean namespaced grammar ?

[15:14] <timotimo> okay, it does not like that at least

[15:15] <lizmat> m: my \if = 1; say if  # other cases do work

[15:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 729caa8f1: OUTPUT: Â«5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>â¤Unsupported use of bare "say"; in Perl 6 please use .say if you meant to call it as a method on $_, or use an explicit invocant or argument, or use &say to refer to the function as a nounâ¤at <tmp>:1â€¦Â»

[15:15] <lizmat> weird, that works locally ?

[15:16] <lizmat> m: my \if = 1; say if

[15:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 729caa8f1: OUTPUT: Â«1â¤Â»

[15:16] <lizmat> looks like the comments handling is interfering

[17:55] <manchicken> Neat! I have Fcntl making a module by simply appending Perl code to the end of a template.

[18:09] <manchicken> OK, I'm confused...

[18:09] *** nativecallable6 left
[18:09] *** nativecallable6 joined
[18:09] <manchicken> I have this:

[18:09] <manchicken> `use Fcntl <SEEK_SET SEEK_CUR SEEK_END O_DIRECTORY>;`

[18:10] <manchicken> It's complaining about a lack of `EXPORT` function, even though each of those symbols is defined as `constant CONST_NAME is export(:ALL) = VALUE;`

[18:10] <manchicken> I'm clearly misunderstanding something in the documentation.

[18:11] <manchicken> I thought the `is export` trait made it available to be explicitly imported one-at-a-time.

[18:16] <manchicken> _sigh_ What's the point of having the ability to compile code snippets if everybody `:skip-test`s their snippets?

[23:17] <yoleaux> 16:14Z <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: i think i have all the pod config hash stuff ready for a PR (after a bit of tidying). i hope all the work i see on value arrays and typing doesn't interfere with it--we'll see--i don't think it will. i have tested all the stuff as it shows currently in the docs (including lists and hashes).

[23:18] <comborico1611> Do you use standard cursor moving keyboard bindings?

[23:20] <AlexDaniel> comborico1611: hmmâ€¦ I guess so

[23:20] <AlexDaniel> ah these, no.

[23:21] <comborico1611> I'm just wondering of the merits of that.  Seems like it's more intuitive to use a video game setup that mimics the arrow keys

[23:21] <comborico1611> Do you use arrow keys or custom?

[23:21] <AlexDaniel> I have a custom keyboard layout where I have arrow keys on altgr+ESDF

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> well actually .oeu because I'm using dvorak

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> and my altgr is on the spacebar so that's rather convenient

[23:22] <comborico1611> That's sounds like a nice setup!
