[07:34] <samcv> guys is it a bad idea or not to create an AppImage with ALL the perl 6 modules

[07:35] <samcv> well. as many as pass building

[07:35] *** pmurias joined
[07:35] <samcv> i think that might be fun

[07:35] <pmurias> grondilu: hi

[07:38] <moritz> samcv: as long as it's not the only option, go for it!

[07:39] <samcv> or could make zef availible and have it install to like ~/.perl6 or something

[07:39] <samcv> since it looks there anyway

[07:40] <samcv> make a rakudo moar-blead with everything in it. or whatever

[07:41] <samcv> and also would test the modules and give a report on it. though some of them may fail because of the appimage and it not starting out in ./

[07:41] <samcv> well. but i can install them before making the appimage. so that shouldn't be too hard.

[07:41] <samcv> might still have the issue they have to recompile when first run. and they may or may not be cached after that. still need to investigate full

[07:45] <samcv> just added cron to it

[07:45] <samcv> but yeah the main real problem is getting it to change path before doing anything. so the relative paths work normally

[07:46] <samcv> does anybody have input on what command line option could be added to do that? what it wuold be?

[07:47] <moritz> --cwd=path

[07:47] <moritz> or --workingdir=path

[07:47] <moritz> or something like that

[07:47] <samcv> yeah that would be great

[07:48] <moritz> or --chdir=path

[07:48] <samcv> good suggestions

[07:48] <samcv> i tried adding a module that does it. but with how the appimage is relative, it totally breaks things to preload modules

[07:49] <samcv> they can be loaded fine in scripts but not *before* because the precompilation and stuff triggers a dependency cycle (even if it's an empty file you're preloading)

[07:51] *** Cabanossi left
[07:54] <samcv> argh. precomps have nonrelative paths in them

[07:54] <samcv> frustrating. so can't put them back in because then hashes are wrong

[07:54] *** Cabanossi joined
[07:55] <samcv> wonder if i can just rename them based on the checksum?

[13:48] <moritz> timotimo: fwiw perl6-all-modules is now up-to-date

[13:52] <timotimo> thanks!

[13:52] <masak> moritz++

[13:52] <timotimo> moritz++

[13:53] <timotimo> so it turns out that we never precompile nfas for grammars that are written in perl6 code. only grammars in nqp code get that benefit, like the Perl6::Grammar itself

[13:53] <masak> huh

[13:54] <masak> potential big speedup?

[13:58] <timotimo> startup improvements could be had

[13:58] <timotimo> so, this is confusing me right now:

[13:59] <timotimo> i see that in the bootstrap a Regex gets @!caps, $!nfa, @!alt_nfas set as attributes, and SET_CAPS, SET_NFA, SET_ALT_NFA, and such set as methods

[14:00] <timotimo> ah, it was just one of the <anon> in there

[14:00] *** lowbro left
[14:01] <timotimo> okay, let's see ...

[14:02] <timotimo> haha

[14:02] <timotimo> could it be ...

[14:02] <timotimo> m)

[14:02] <timotimo> nqp has the method ALT_NFAS that it calls to get at the nfas

[14:02] <timotimo> rakudo calls it ALT_NFA

[14:04] <timotimo> oh, not quite

[14:04] <timotimo> that's supposed to be a different method

[14:04] *** jdmmmmm joined
[14:05] <timotimo> why ALT_NFA is calling atkey on an attribute that's supposedly a List ... nobody will ever know?

[14:05] *** jdmmmmm left
[14:08] <timotimo> yeah, we're totally storing a hash inside an attribute that's defined to be List

[14:11] <timotimo> it's iterating over the result of ALT_NFAS into a variable named $name, but it's actually expected to be a pair ... who thought of all this :D

[17:39] <alphah> how can I merge these two hashes:

[17:39] <alphah> %mainhash: {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => value2}, subhash2 => {key3 => value3, key4 => True}}

[17:39] <alphah> %otherhash:  {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => othervalue2}, subhash2 => {key5 => value5, key6 => True}}

[17:39] <alphah> sotha %mainhash becomes {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => othervalue2}, subhash2 => {key3 => value3, key4 => True, key5 => value5, key6 => True}}

[17:40] *** xfix_ left
[17:41] <alphah> merge keys of %otherhash to %mainhash, if duplicate keys , then overwrite %mainhash and use the vlaues from %otherhash

[17:44] <MasterDuke> m: my %a = (a => 1, b => 2); my %b = (b => 3, c => 4); %a ,= %b; dd %a

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 064b58: OUTPUT: «Hash %a = {:a(1), :b(3), :c(4)}␤»

[17:45] <MasterDuke> that works for a single level of hashes, haven't tried with multi-leveled hashes

[17:46] <alphah> yes, doesn't work for multi level hashes

[17:49] <TimToady> m: my %a = :1a, :2b, :3c; my %b = :42b; %a «=» %b; say %a

[17:51] *** setty1 joined
[17:51] <TimToady> that might recurse

[17:52] <TimToady> but it's probably gonna screw up your top level

[17:52] <TimToady> sometimes you just gotta write a map :)

[17:53] <alphah> hmm

[17:53] <TimToady> at one point we had a .tree command that could remap differently on different levels, dunno if we still do

[17:55] <jnthn> m: my %mainhash := {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => 'value2'},subhash2 => {key3 => 'value3', key4 => True}}; my %otherhash := {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => 'othervalue2'}, subhash2 => {key5 => 'value5', key6 => True}}; for %otherhash { %mainhash{.key} = hash %mainhash{.key}, .value }; say %mainhash # shortest I figured so far

[17:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 064b58: OUTPUT: «{subhash1 => {key1 True␤key2       value2 => {key1 => True, key2 => othervalue2}}, subhash2 => {key3       value3␤key4     True => {key5 => value5, key6 => True}}}␤»

[17:56] <jnthn> Uh, not sure it's right though :)

[17:57] <jnthn> m: my %mainhash := {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => 'value2'},subhash2 => {key3 => 'value3', key4 => True}}; my %otherhash := {subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => 'othervalue2'}, subhash2 => {key5 => 'value5', key6 => True}}; for %otherhash { %mainhash{.key} = hash %mainhash{.key}<>, .value<> }; say %mainhash # shortest I figured so far

[17:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 064b58: OUTPUT: «{subhash1 => {key1 => True, key2 => othervalue2}, subhash2 => {key3 => value3, key4 => True, key5 => value5, key6 => True}}␤»

[17:57] <TimToady> maybe ««=»=» or some such

[17:57] <jnthn> that looks more like it

[18:20] <TreyHarris> Can anybody point me at a P6 port of a perlxs-dependent module? I just want to crib off how it was done, I can figure out my own way but there are probably already conventions I can follow

[18:21] <TreyHarris> (A full port, I mean, not a p6-to-p5 bridge)

[18:21] <mst> I'm not sure there exactly are such things, p6 seems to go straight to FFI

[18:21] <mst> so it's more like a perl5 module using http://p3rl.org/FFI::Platypus

[18:22] <mst> jnthn: suggestions for a good example of 'is native' ?

[18:23] <TreyHarris> mst: that's what I was going to do when I said "I can figure out my own way"-- just translate the .t files into Perl 6 and rewrite the XS into "is native" calls. Assuming that the P5 API is equivalent to the best P6 API, which it may not be.

[18:29] <jnthn> Depends what kind of library it is. If it's some C code that you want to compile on install and call, see Digest::SHA1::Native. If it's to some installed library (and maybe include a Win32 binary install option) then there's loads of examples; Acrhive::LibArchive::Raw is probably a nice mix of non-tiny but isolated.

[18:30] <jnthn> And if it's some kind of non-blocking library and you want an example of how to front it with Promise/Supply, SSH::LibSSH is probably the best example so far

[18:30] <TreyHarris> I'm specifically curious if anyone has done it in a case where different OS variants are smooshed together via XS into the same Perl 5. Like Proc::ProcessTable. 

[18:31] <TreyHarris> $*OS and $*SYS, which I remember from the Apocalypses, don't seem to exist anymore, so I don't even see how to switch on it

[18:31] <jnthn> It's $*DISTRO and $*KERNEL nowadays

[18:32] <jnthn> So far as native calls go, we don't resolve them until the first call

[18:32] <TreyHarris> jnthn: and regex matching against it at compiletime (to switch on <linux bsd etc>) is allowable?

[18:33] <jnthn> I think they're objects rather than strings so you may be able to exact match

[18:33] <jnthn> m: say $*KERNEL

[18:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1b4af: OUTPUT: «linux (4.4.57.18.3.default)␤»

[18:33] <jnthn> m: say $*KERNEL.^methods

[18:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1b4af: OUTPUT: «(BUILD name version release hardware arch bits signals signal Str gist auth signature desc)␤»

[18:33] <jnthn> m: say $*KERNEL.name

[18:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1b4af: OUTPUT: «linux␤»

[18:34] <TreyHarris> m: say $*KERNEL.^methods

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1b4af: OUTPUT: «(BUILD name version release hardware arch bits signals signal Str gist auth signature desc)␤»

[18:34] <TreyHarris> ah, cool

[18:34] <TreyHarris> m: say $*KERNEL.name

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar f1b4af: OUTPUT: «linux␤»

[18:34] <TreyHarris> that may be sufficient.

[18:37] <TreyHarris> -Should I define such native subs in a phaser if I'm going to do that kind of thing? Or since it's not resolved until first call can I just do method dispatch on something I get out of $*KERNEL and assume the invalid native calls will never be reached?

[18:38] <TreyHarris> i.e., method exposedthing (not native) uses $*KERNEL to call method hiddenthing-linux or method hiddenthing-bsd, etc.?

[18:39] <TreyHarris> or can I even subsignature off of $*KERNEL itself and use a multi?

[18:39] <jnthn> Personally I'd probably rely on it not being resolved until first call and just dispatch to the correct one

[18:39] <TreyHarris> (Sorry, I know I _can_. I just don't know if I should.)

[18:40] <jnthn> Unless there were a load of calls and I wanted to break them out into separate modules by OS or something

[18:40] <jnthn> Not sure if I'd where-cause it off $*KERNEL

[18:40] <jnthn> Those aren't...entirely optimal :)

[18:41] <jnthn> Another option would be to have a role declaring the "interface" and then write a class doing it per OS or whatever

[18:42] <jnthn> And then something like constant TheThingy is export = do given $*KERNEL { when 'linux' { TheLinuxImpl } ... }

[18:43] <jnthn> Then the implementation is selected at compile time and you don't have repeated runtime checks, and export a consistent symbol name to userspace

[18:43] <jnthn> uh, s/userspace/the user of your module/ :)

[18:43] <jnthn> The interface role is optional of course, it just gives people a portable type they can talk about

[18:45] <jnthn> shopping, bbl

[18:45] *** Actualeyes left
[18:47] <TreyHarris> jnthn: yeah, makes sense. The compiler doesn't even let you write a where clause for a parameterless signature, and taking advantage of it letting you write something like "multi foo($a where { $*KERNEL.name ~~ 'linux'}) { ... }" when you do have a parameter seems fugly as hell

[18:49] *** Actualeyes joined
[18:49] <TreyHarris> jnthn: I like the "constant TheThingy is export = do given $*KERNEL" a lot. It answers a lot of cases where I felt frustrated that I couldn't declare the same name twice globally and disambiguate between them lexically

[18:50] *** kaare__ joined
[18:51] <TreyHarris> why I was complaining to geekosaur yesterday that use lack's Haskell's "import Long.Thing as T" and "import Prelude hiding (coreThing); import Elsewhere (coreThing)"

[18:56] *** kyan joined
[18:56] <TreyHarris> That said, does that mean we've entirely given up on the idea of answering the diamond dependency problem where you depend on A and B where A depends on C version 1 and B depends on C version 2?

[18:57] <TreyHarris> Because I know that was a design goal

[19:00] <geekosaur> not so much given up, as not having tackled it yet and probably not going to happen for v6.d either

[19:00] <geekosaur> it's a Hard Problem

[19:01] <TreyHarris> geekosaur: Oh, I know, and you know I know :-)

[19:20] <skids> TreyHarris: I had a relatively efficient runtime backend chooser in the Sum:: module (lib/Sum/Recourse.pm), but it is currently bitrotten.  Allowed the module to roll with it if someone installed/uninstalled a native library and fallback to a different one or pure Perl6.

[22:04] *** mcmillhj joined
[22:07] <[Coke]> it has the dynamic bar at the top, which usually has an escape "key" in it.
