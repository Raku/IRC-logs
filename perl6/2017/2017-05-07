[02:11] <raschipi> mienaikage: I always wanted to do it, but didn't because it didn't have a Perl6 track.

[02:16] <mienaikage> There is a Perl 6 track there, it's currently in the upcoming section

[02:17] <mienaikage> I've been poking around with the repo for it over the past few months

[02:17] <mienaikage> There's about 20 exercises at the moment

[18:58] <Zoffix> 2 days ago, we were talking about IO stuff and I said nqp-only Perl 6 read was 4.4x slower than Perl 5's version, but I actually forgot the chomp in Perl 5 version, so the actual difference is just 3.5x

[18:59] <Zoffix> And well, even then it's not a perfect comparison 'cause we do all the grapheme stuff

[18:59] <timotimo> hold on

[18:59] <timotimo> ah, that was with built-in chomp config for the file handle, yeah?

[19:00] <timotimo> isn't there "autochomp" in perl5, too?

[19:00] *** aindilis left
[19:00] <Zoffix> On command line yeah

[19:00] <Zoffix> or maybe that's just appending "\n" on print

[19:01] <Zoffix> Basically, I timed:

[19:01] <Zoffix> time perl -C -wlE 'open my $fh, "<:encoding(UTF-8)", "foo"; while (<$fh>) { chomp }'

[19:01] <Zoffix> vs

[19:01] <Zoffix> time perl6 -e 'use nqp; my $fh := nqp::open("foo", "r"); nqp::while(($_ := nqp::readlinechompfh($fh)), nqp::null)'

[20:18] <BenGoldberg> After installing perl6 on bash on windows, running certain commands (p6doc, zef, panda) produces "Dynamic variable $*REPO not found" ... how do I fix this?

[20:19] <El_Che> BenGoldberg: how did you install it?

[20:20] <BenGoldberg> sudo apt-get install rakudo

[20:21] <El_Che> can yoy try this pkg?  https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases/tag/2017.03_03

[20:21] <El_Che> the ubuntu 16.04 one

[20:22] <robertle_> even sid only has 2016.12, not sure that's worth installing anymore..

[20:22] <timotimo> "$*REPO not found" sounds like you have a rather old version; can you tell us your perl6 --version?

[20:23] *** lizmat joined
[20:23] <BenGoldberg> "This is perl6 version 2015.11 built on MoarVM version 2015.11"

[20:26] <timotimo> that's really bad

[20:26] <timotimo> you won't be able to run any package manager's recent versions with that

[20:26] <timotimo> as you've already found out :)

[20:29] <BenGoldberg> When running "sudo /opt/rakudo/bin/install_zef_as_root", I got this error message: "/opt/rakudo/bin/moar: error while loading shared libraries: libmoar.so: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument"

[20:30] <El_Che> /opt/rakudo/bin/fix_windows10

[20:30] <El_Che> first

[20:30] <BenGoldberg> It's not there.

[20:31] <El_Che> did you pick 16.04?

[20:32] <BenGoldberg> I ran "sudo dpkg -i perl6-rakudo-moarvm-ubuntu16.10_20170300-03_amd64.deb"

[20:32] <El_Che> you need to download the 16.04 pkg

[20:32] <El_Che> windows runs ubuntu 16.04 on it's last service pack (creator's upgrade)

[20:32] <El_Che> the previous runs Ubuntu 14.04

[20:33] <El_Che> howover, the ubuntu 16.04 pkg works on both

[20:33] <BenGoldberg> And 16.10 doesn't exist on windows yet?

[20:33] <El_Che> indeed

[20:33] <El_Che> it's the same rakudo

[20:34] <El_Che> just compiled on the stated os

[20:34] <El_Che> thing is pretty self contained, so the 16.04 version does also work on 17.04

[20:34] <El_Che> maybe I need to clarify in the readme

[20:35] <BenGoldberg> Do I need to uninstall the wrong one, or can I just dpkg the correct one and the wrong one will go away?

[20:35] * BenGoldberg is not an expert

[20:35] *** labster left
[20:35] <BenGoldberg> Err, not a linux expert

[20:35] <El_Che> normally it will overwrite the old one, but remove it first to be sure

[20:36] <BenGoldberg> Ok.

[20:36] <BenGoldberg> So just rm -rf /opt/rakudo ?

[20:36] <El_Che> no

[20:36] <El_Che> sudo apt-get remove --purge perl6-rakudo-moarvm-ubuntu16.10

[20:37] <El_Che> got to go, ping me if you have problems

[20:39] <BenGoldberg> El_Che++
