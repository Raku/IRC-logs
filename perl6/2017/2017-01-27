[07:44] <samcv> it's a sequence

[07:45] *** holyghost left
[07:46] <samcv> has links to all of them if you want to see

[07:46] <samcv> yeah it's git commit

[07:46] <parv> thanks.

[07:47] <samcv> the Name Alias and the Emoji sequences/ZWJ sequences were in the latest Jan release of rakudo

[07:47] <samcv> i need to make it more clear, BELL isn't a name alias that's the actual name of the symbol

[07:51] *** pyrimidine joined
[07:53] *** agentzh left
[07:53] <parv> samcv, is an emoji symbol (in Perl 6) some kind of (font independent) graphic/icon?

[07:54] <samcv> well. it follows Unicode grapheme rules

[07:54] <samcv> m: "\c[woman gesturing ok]".chars.say

[07:54] *** wamba joined
[07:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar ae9d51: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[07:54] <samcv> so it's one grapheme/character

[07:54] <samcv> because unicode says it should not be split up

[07:54] <samcv> m: "\r\n".chars.say

[07:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar ae9d51: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[07:54] <samcv> this is a common one as well. but there's lots of things that are like that

[07:55] <samcv> like letters with diacritics are actually multiple codepoints, but in perl6 it seperates them as graphemes so they stay together

[07:56] <samcv> m: say "\c[woman, ZWJ, boy]".chars

[07:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar ae9d51: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[07:56] <samcv> like i don't think ^ is actually a real emoji, but it follows the unicode grapheme rules and counts as 1

[07:57] <samcv> obviously in case ones get added. ZWJ = Zero width joiner

[12:49] <tragr> BAD NEWS, rumors say that Trump plans to set unicode illegal for all governamental agency. This affect all software which "allows typesetting, printing or visualizing character outside the ASCII standard range", including the ones which fit in an 8bits encoding. All those softwares are deemed anti-american

[12:50] <jast> since when are rumours news?

[12:53] <brokenchicken> I wish Trump would issue an executivie order that forbida mentioning anything about Trump to anyone eho isn't in Murica

[12:56] <DrForr> Anyway, this weekend I'm going to see about adding .find() and proper walking to Perl6::Parser so it'll filter out docs or whatnot.

[12:58] <sena_kun> DrForr, it's really cool. I'm looking at Perl6::Parser for some time(but kinda too lazy to read docs really serious), am I right that with this module it will be possible to parse a tree, walk over it with some modifications along the way and dump the tree as a string similar to parsed?

[12:59] <sena_kun> *seriously

[13:01] <DrForr> You can aleady parse and dump. I need to add .next(), .previous(), .parent(), .children() axes and then I'm either going to add a proper .splice() or override the array slicing operations somehow.

[13:03] <sena_kun> Oh, amazing. DrForr++

[13:07] <DrForr> That way when the parser returns $root, you can call $root.children() to get the doc children &c, and $node.splice(...) will insert while maintaining links. It might even skip infrastructure nodes or build them as needed.

[14:35] <brokenchicken> These are the relevant rules: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/055d00d0e2d76ec7445a16f33403d6fb#file-p6-p6-L18-L26 and the text to parse is "fuc greet\n üí¨ 'hi'\nton"

[14:40] <brokenchicken> And here's the .^trace-on() for that grammar: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/7862c94abb6c2008df928608806447d4

[14:42] <brokenchicken> Seems the part that's missing from the match is the closing 'ton' in rule fucbody

[14:44] *** rba_ left
[14:44] <perlpilot> brokenchicken: my guess after a brief look is: fucbody is a rule which means :sigspace is on and eating your whitespace so that \n won't match.  

[14:45] *** rba_ joined

[15:57] <brokenchicken> The syntax should really sell it to Ruby programmers ;)

[16:14] <gregf_> Perl 7?

[16:15] <perlpilot> sub/bus would appeal to the shell programmers 

[16:15] <brokenchicken> I went with fun/ion

[16:15] <brokenchicken> To encourage more fun in programming ;)

[16:15] <brokenchicken> gregf_: yeah man. It's the latest and greatest Perl of them all. With largest version number and bestest logo: https://github.com/perl7/perl7

[16:16] <perlpilot> Programming languages need the ability to have more whimsy like Perl  ;-)

[16:16] <gregf_> Heh

[16:17] <perlpilot> brokenchicken: so ... what happened to the "ct" anyway?  

[16:17] <brokenchicken> perlpilot: what ct?

[16:17] <perlpilot> fun ct ion

[16:18] <perlpilot> it just got elided because func/tion was too many letter?

[16:18] <perlpilot> er, letters

[16:18] <brokenchicken> perlpilot: Ah, well, Perl 7 wants to preserve its heritage of using just three letters to start a function, but at the same time we want to attract Javascript programmers and we don't want to confuse them with 'subs' hence the change to calling them functions

[16:19] <brokenchicken> Exactly. Too many letters. In the no-time-for-nonsense futuristic programming of Perl 7 we don't need to type 4 letters where 3 will suffice

[16:20] <perlpilot> Surely then, there should be single unicode letter synonyms for fuc/ion

[16:20] <perlpilot> (why type 3 letters when 1 will do?)

[16:20] <perigrin> brokenchicken: obviously what you need to do is core https://metacpan.org/pod/lambda

[16:22] <brokenchicken> Our marketing research shows programmers don't want any silly symbols in their programs and so Perl 7 will stick to using just the symbols written on the keyboard. The only exception is the print function that in Perl 7 is üí¨ because we still want to show people how cool and trendy we are.

[17:01] <haxmeister> did you have any difficulty with permissions?

[17:01] <brokenchicken> Nope

[17:01] <haxmeister> well poo

[17:01] <brokenchicken> What sort of permissions?

[17:02] <haxmeister> it won't let me save a file.. even a new one.. saying I don't have permission

[17:02] <brokenchicken> As I recall, I just downloaded a .deb from https://atom.io/ and sudo dpkg -i it

[17:02] <brokenchicken> Where are you trying to save it to?

[17:03] <brokenchicken> You could try running it from the terminal to see if it spews out any debug info into it.

[17:03] <haxmeister> actually it just worked

[22:47] <yoleaux> 22:15Z <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: it's not completely terrible as is. how much nqp:: is required to get that 20%?

[22:49] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: for example, this line https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/Unicodable.p6#L103 turns into this: for @words -> str $word { $sieve .= grep({nqp::isge_i(nqp::index(nqp::getuniname($_), $word, 0), 0)}) };

[22:59] <MasterDuke> that's not bad

[23:03] <kybr> brokenchicken: https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry C¬´ fixed-width POD text ¬ª i still don't get it.. is C something i can look up and read about?

[23:03] <cale2> Do you think Dependent types and Contracts/Guards are similar? 

[23:04] <cale2> I guess the difference is that dependent types are built in as a required system. Whereas contracts are optional

[23:04] <cale2> But functionally they provide the same thing

[23:07] <cale2> The example I see with Idris is `reverseInvolution : (xs : List a) -> reverse (reverse xs) = r`

[23:08] <geekosaur> kybr, http://design.perl6.org/S26.html#Example_specifiers

[23:08] <geekosaur> this is not part of perl 6 code, but perl 6 documentation (POD6)

[23:08] <cale2> But the same in P6 is `subset ReverseInvolution of Str where { $_.reverse == $_ }`

[23:13] <kybr> geekosaur: ooooh. i get it now. much thanks!

[23:14] <geekosaur> heh

[23:16] <brokenchicken> heh? :)

[23:16] <geekosaur> just the way you jumped on it as soon as I clarified :)

[23:17] <brokenchicken> Nah, I jumped on it before, I was just struggling to get the code example to compile correctly :)

[23:52] <brokenchicken> In `sub foo:sym<meow> {}` what is the `:sym<>` bit called? "The :sym<> _____ is reserved" what fits in the blank?
