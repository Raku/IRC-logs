[00:24] <TimToady> which one looks darker depends on how many times I type Alt-I

[06:41] <noub> not sequence \r\n?

[06:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «1␤»

[06:42] <lookatme> or \r\n will convert to \n automate

[06:43] <moritz> noub: match \c[LINE FEED] for the single \n

[06:45] <noub> i think this is not really problem if it will convert to \n if i can take to token string between "Descr=" and \' \' or \" \" or without and to comma

[06:46] <noub> something like { "Descr=" (<quotation-multiline-text-with-commas> | <multiline-text-without-commas> ) }

[06:47] <noub> if text between \"\", than could contain '""'

[06:48] <noub> i need comething like in CSV-example, but more complex

[06:48] <moritz> you can model that as   / \" ~ \" [ <-["]>+ | '""' ]* /

[07:21] <Voldenet> How to say "parse as int or use 0" in perl6?

[07:22] <moritz> m: sub maybe-int(Str $x) { $x.Int // 0 }; say ('abc', '42').map: &maybe-int

[07:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «(0 42)␤»

[07:22] <moritz> you don't need try/CATCH because .Int returns a Failure

[07:22] <Voldenet> ah, a failure is not like an exception

[07:22] <Voldenet> say ('abc', '42').map: { .Int // 0 }

[07:22] <evalable6> Voldenet, rakudo-moar f3f99b3ac: OUTPUT: «(0 42)»

[07:23] <Voldenet> i forgot m:... but it still worked :D

[07:23] <moritz> magical realism!

[07:26] <lookatme> How about .?Int // 0

[07:26] <lookatme> m: sub f($x) { $x.?Int // 0; }; f(class F {}.new());

[07:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: ( no output )

[07:26] <lookatme> m: sub f($x) { $x.?Int // 0; }; say f(class F {}.new());

[07:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[07:27] <moritz> m: sub f($x) { $x.Int // 0; }; say f(class F {}.new());

[07:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «No such method 'Int' for invocant of type 'F'␤  in sub f at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[07:27] <moritz> it really depends on what you / Voldenet want :-)

[07:27] <lookatme> em.

[07:29] *** skids left
[07:29] <moritz> the "parse as" seemed to imply to me that the basis was a Str. I might be wrong, of course

[07:29] <Voldenet> yeah, it's string

[07:29] <Voldenet> actually they're all Cool

[07:29] <Voldenet> because it's a shell script

[08:13] <Voldenet> I tried to make some piece of code that'd figure out how to transform one list into another and made this horrible piece of code:

[08:14] *** Cabanossi joined
[08:14] <Voldenet> it's just for practice, got any suggestions or syntaxes i should've used?

[08:20] <masak> Voldenet: it's a matter of taste, but I tend to do smaller things and more pure transformations inside of a .map

[08:21] <masak> Voldenet: so I'd be tempted to have that entire loop as a `for lines() { ...; push @fns, $ret }` instead

[08:21] <masak> or, I guess, if you wanted to be fancy, `gather for lines() { ...; take $ret }`

[08:21] <masak> but I realize I hardly ever use `gather` anymore

[08:21] <masak> I should blog about that :)

[08:22] <Voldenet> I tend to use a lot of .map because it can be optimized later ;)

[08:22] <Voldenet> map here can even work in parallel most of the time, which would help if I turned a transformation functions into service calls

[08:25] <lookatme> gather take would be faster than map

[08:25] <Voldenet> Oh, really? :O

[08:27] <lookatme> And `{}()` is clear enough, no need enclosed with `()` 

[08:27] <lookatme> I mean line 19 - 23

[08:27] <Voldenet> Oh, right.

[08:27] <Voldenet> hm, can gather take be parallelised later?

[08:28] <masak> I think both `for` and `map` could have a `hyper` or `race` added in front...

[08:28] <masak> might be wrong, though

[08:30] <Voldenet> yeah, lines().hyper and @t.race would work

[08:32] <Voldenet> m: my @x = gather { for 1..10 { take start { sleep($_/10); $_ }}}; say await @x

[08:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)␤»

[08:33] <masak> lookatme: no

[08:33] <Voldenet> one could do this

[08:34] <lookatme> oh, seem like **faster** is depend on situation

[08:35] <lookatme> but `gather take` can make lazy list

[08:38] <Voldenet> well, the .grep.Set will make full evaluation anyway

[08:38] <Voldenet> so there's no reason to make it a lazy list

[08:39] <Voldenet> with lazy eval, i'd probably use .cache anyway, which destroys the point

[08:39] <Voldenet> (I guess lazy approach could use less memory though)

[08:40] <Voldenet> (...but would cost performance, so it's a tradeoff, if my intuition isn't wrong)

[08:48] <lookatme> em, yeah, lazy list has its advantage, but not  suitable for every case

[10:48] <Zoffix> grondilu: you could look at "EXPR" parser in nqp.

[10:48] <Zoffix> There might even be a way to use it in Perl 6

[10:48] <Zoffix> m: use QAST:from<NQP>; say grammar Mathy is HLL::Grammar { token TOP { <EXPR> } }.parse: '2+2'

[10:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar f3f99b: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Cannot find method 'submethod_table' on object of type NQPClassHOW␤»

[10:48] <Zoffix> which isn't this I guess...

[11:43] <Voldenet> hm, is it even possible with perl's parser?

[11:44] <Voldenet> (the a+b+c case)

[11:45] *** curt_ joined
[11:45] <Voldenet> because "expr -> binary | unary | '(' expr ')', binary -> expr '+' expr" is left-recursive

[11:48] <Voldenet> even easier "expr -> expr '+' expr | '(' expr ')' | digit"

[11:50] *** aborazmeh left
[11:51] <masak> Voldenet: I tend to rewrite left-recursive stuff as using the `%` metaoperator

[11:52] <masak> so `expr -> expr '+' expr` would become something like `rule add-expr { <mult-expr>+ % "+" }`

[11:52] <grondilu> .tell Zoffix thanks! I used one of the external links to write this:  https://gist.github.com/f1b52ab99dcfd503b09ef6041e641531

[11:52] <yoleaux> grondilu: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[11:53] <Voldenet> hmm, any info on this?

[11:53] <Voldenet> https://docs.perl6.org/language/grammars doesn't even contain any %

[12:03] <Voldenet> Oh I know it's possible. :P

[12:03] <Voldenet> I just know how to do this using perl6 grammars

[12:03] <Voldenet> s/know/don't know/

[12:03] <Voldenet> slight difference ;)

[12:03] <Zoffix> Perl 6 parses itself using a perl6 grammar (pretty much)

[12:05] <grondilu> maybe it does but if so it's quite convoluted

[12:06] *** kurahaupo left
[12:06] *** kurahaupo joined
[12:08] <Zoffix> Sure. You can setup your own precendence and stuff; all handled by it

[12:08] <Zoffix> Like this: https://github.com/perl7/perl7/blob/master/src/perl7.nqp#L112-L116

[12:08] <Zoffix> m: say grammar Algebra { rule TOP { ^^ <expr> $$ }; regex expr { "(" <expr> ")" || \d+ || <expr>+ % "+" }}.parse("1+1");

[12:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar e89ba8: OUTPUT: «｢1+1｣␤ expr => ｢1+1｣␤  expr => ｢1｣␤  expr => ｢1｣␤»

[12:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar e89ba8: OUTPUT: «｢test｣␤ expr => ｢test｣␤  invalid => ｢test｣␤»

[15:33] <eater> this is what Im doing currently

[15:34] <eater> it's a slurpy parameter and flattens the arrays together

[15:36] <ugexe> if you trust the input it doesn't really matter, since it can just as well delete all the files using perl6 IO

[15:37] <eater> but < > doesn't parse anything right? it's just "rm -rf /vagrant".words or am I wrong?

[15:48] <hahainternet> so i asked a question yesterday i'm just going to blatently repeat today, using something like 'regex whatever { <@listoftokens>}' in a grammar doesn't seem to backtrack, i'm presuming because the regex only ever matches the first of the list and won't try alternatives

[15:48] <hahainternet> can anyone provide advice on debugging and/or programmatically adding a bunch of sym tokens so i can distinguish but group them?

[15:52] <AlexDaniel> m: my @a = <aa a c>; say ‘ab’ ~~ /<@a>‘b’/

[16:10] <hahainternet> jnthn: roger, having said that, that is rather ugly and i'm not sure if it's explained well in the docs that things will behave this way

[16:10] <hahainternet> i don't even know if what i described is the actual cause

[16:10] <hahainternet> however, regardless, thanks for the answer, i'll do that :)

[16:11] <jnthn> I'm pretty sure that <@foo> isn't something that can be backtracked in to

[16:12] <hahainternet> i should file bugs i know :(

[16:32] <timotimo> so numpy has a "nanmin" function that gives you the smallest number in an array ignoring NaN

[16:32] <timotimo> perl6 doesn't need that because apparently NaN is never min-er than another number

[16:32] <timotimo> however

[16:32] <timotimo> a NaN inside a list that you pass to max will dominate

[17:07] <hythm> git clone https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew ~/.rakudobrew; cd ~/.rakudobrew; ^Ckudobrew build moar; rakudobrew build zef; zef install linenoise; zef install Grammar::Debugger

[17:08] <hythm> but for some reason I get this error when I lunch perl6-debug-m: Non ast passed to WANTED: NQPMu

[17:08] <timotimo> sorry, perl6-debug-m is b0rked at the moment ;(

[17:08] *** setty1 joined
[17:09] <timotimo> Grammar::Debugger is something different, though. you use that by putting a use statement into your code

[17:09] <hythm> hmm, Thanks timotimo. 

[17:10] <raschipi> Bork bork bork.

[17:10] <hythm> Yeah Grammar::Debugger is not working for me. this gist has the error and also the output of installing perl6:

[17:10] <hythm> https://gist.github.com/alphah77/9535aeefec2a76ec1164075f4e1e30a9

[17:15] <hythm> so basically if I added use Grammar::Debugger to the code, it throws error when try to parse TOP regex.

[17:15] *** raschipi left

[17:30] <hythm> looks like I will have to troubleshoot a grammar issue manually, which i know it will be difficult :D

[17:55] <Zoffix> hythm: which rakudo version are you using? Recall what I mentioned: 2017.03 rakudo might now have the issues you're experiencing. Did you try using that version? Also, none of these issues will get fixed if we don't know about them, so it's in your own best interest to report them.

[17:55] <Zoffix> huggable: rakudobug

[17:55] <huggable> Zoffix, Report bugs by emailing to [email@hidden.address]

[17:58] <Zoffix> would save me ~1hr of time a month

[18:03] <hythm> Zoffix, I tried 2017.03 but there is no difference. I want to report the bug, but I don't know what to report. I made simple programm has simple Grammar and Grammar::Debugger worked fine. So I'm trying to see if this is really a bug or I have something wrong in my code

[18:03] <hythm> this is a gaming laptop :P

[18:05] <Zoffix> hythm: "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)" error is not very useful to users, so there's a good chance it can be improved even if it's a problem with your code. "Non ast passed to WANTED: NQPMu" is a definite bug and users should never see such errors

[18:05] <hythm> I will report a bug and mention this error I get "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)", if that is sufficant

[18:06] <hythm> alright, I will report that then

[18:25] * TimToady doesn't give a rip whether something seems js-y or not; we designed our various equality operators by our own selves

[18:26] <Voldenet> I still find it moderately funny, because it's identity operator in js as well :-)

[18:26] <Voldenet> not that I don't like familiarity

[18:26] <TimToady> convergent evolution, and all that :)

[18:27] <Zoffix> yeah, JS got `use strict` and soon (already?) will get the /s switch for regexes, like Perl 5

[18:28] <TimToady> mebbe they'll borrow Perl 6 regexes in another 15 years or so...

[18:28] <Zoffix> :)

[18:29] <Voldenet> js is a serious and modern language now, it has classes

[18:31] *** Zoffix left
[18:32] <Voldenet> actually, if I were to choose the important feature in JS, i'd pick async and promises

[18:32] *** Ven_ joined
[18:32] <Voldenet> it greatly improved quality of most code

[18:34] <Voldenet> and one could argue that anything above C and its structs is syntax sugar ;)

[18:34] <Voldenet> because you're just implicitly passing objects

[18:35] <timotimo> but that's only run-time

[18:36] <timotimo> at compile time you're free to stack on as much as you want

[20:52] <jnthn> https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/perl6/

[20:52] <tadzik> they should perhaps mention to not rely on master but rather on a specific tag

[21:08] <ugexe> hehe you beat me by a few minutes robertle... im getting slow

[21:09] <robertle> beer helps :)

[21:11] <user3> why can't I compile this to MoarVM byte code:  perl6 --target=mbc -e "say 'Hello, world'"

[21:11] <user3> I get the error message: "Cannot dump this object; no dump method"

[21:11] *** skids left
[21:12] <user3> I've done the basic installation for rakudo Moar

[21:12] <jnthn> It needs an output file, since it's a bunch of binary, so it decides not to dump it on your terminal

[21:12] <timotimo> user3: you have to --target=foobar.moarvm

[21:13] <timotimo> or, wait

[21:13] <timotimo> --output=foobar.moarvm

[21:13] <jnthn> --output=foo.moarvm

[21:13] <timotimo> and then you can dump that with moar --dump foobar.moarvm

[21:14] *** Cabanossi left
[21:14] <jnthn> Yeah, worth noting that compiling a script is only really a debugging aid; only modules are usefully usable in compiled form (so far, at least)

[21:14] *** Cabanossi joined
[21:15] <jnthn> And you don't need to do that manually, it's handled automatically

[21:15] <awwaiid> japhb: you should come by and say hi :)

[21:15] <ugexe> put your script in a module, and have your script just be `use My::Script` to compile scripts

[21:17] <ugexe> ya know we already use wrappers around installed scripts... there is no reason we don't just use those wrappers as the perl6 entry point and do that automatically on install

[21:18] <jnthn> Only caveat is that a MAIN needs an is export sticking on it

[21:18] *** TEttinger joined
[21:19] <ugexe> hmm no way to import them explicitly?

[21:21] <jnthn> At Perl 6 level not a way to import things that aren't exported. But yeah, the whole import mechanism works by being given the UNIT of the imported thing, which is normally just used to find EXPORT, EXPORTHOW and friends.

[21:21] <jnthn> But of course &MAIN could be dug out of it :)

[21:23] <timotimo> hm, it's not lexical-only?

[21:24] <timotimo> well, i guess top-level lexicals would show up in the module itself perhaps?

[21:24] <jnthn> timotimo: UNIT is the top-level lexical scope

[21:25] <jnthn> And on being loaded a module stashes that somewhere the module loader can get at it

[21:25] <jnthn> Which is how EXPORT and GLOBALish and friends are located

[21:26] *** skids joined
[21:27] <timotimo> ah, i see

[21:29] *** cdg left
[21:30] <user3> ok so I did this: perl6 --target=mbc --output=foobar.moarvm -e "put 'hello, world'"

[21:30] <user3> And this: moar --dump foobar.moarvm > foobar.mbc

[21:30] <user3> Then I tried "moar foobar.mbc"  I get the error message "Unhandled exception: Bytecode stream corrupt (missing magic string)"

[21:30] <user3> I also tried "moar foobar.moarvm" I get the error message "Unhandled exception: While looking for 'ModuleLoader.moarvm': no such file or directory at <unknown>:1  (foobar.moarvm:<dependencies+deserialize>)"

[21:30] <timotimo> oh, no

[21:31] <timotimo> i thought you wanted to dump the contents of the moarvm file

[21:31] *** cdg joined
[21:31] <user3> i just want to compile the code a bit to improve performance

[21:31] <timotimo> you will have to invoke the code with the perl6 script or at least steal the commandline flags it uses

[21:31] <timotimo> in that case, do it like jnthn and ugexe suggested

[21:31] <timotimo> put everything into modules because these get precompiled for you automatically

[21:31] *** nadim left
[21:32] <timotimo> then just have a "program" that does "use MyApp::Entrypoint" or whatever you call that module

[21:32] <ugexe> all of your MAINs have to be in one module

[21:34] <robertle> jnthn: in your latest blog post re funding, what does "non-blocking await" mean? isn't blocking the whole point of await?

[21:37] *** dct joined
[21:39] <Voldenet> robertle: await actually yields continuation

[21:39] <Voldenet> non-blocking, that is

[21:39] <Voldenet> and blocking await probably does some magic with a thread

[21:39] <Voldenet> while capturing the thread in the process

[21:40] <Voldenet> (actually I'm not sure how await could be blocking, but probably because it takes a thread)

[21:40] <jnthn> I thought I'd written this up somewhere but I don't find it

[21:41] <hythm> m: class A { multi method a(Str :$b) { say "First" }; multi method a() { say "Second" } }; A.new.a # (named arg) Why dispatch to first method

[21:41] <robertle> not sure I understand: my current thread calls await on a promise, which will block until the promise is kept/broken. right? that's the point, isn't it?

[21:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «First␤»

[21:41] <jnthn> Anyways, the Perl 6.c semantics - for lack of time to do anything better - is that await will use a condition variable

[21:41] <robertle> makes sense

[21:41] <hythm> m: class A { multi method a(Str $b) { say "First" }; multi method a() { say "Second" } }; A.new.a

[21:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «Second␤»

[21:42] <jnthn> This "works", but it means that a real OS thread is blocked

[21:42] <Voldenet> hythm: named arguments are optional, but

[21:42] <Voldenet> m: class A { multi method a(Str:D :$b) { say "First" }; multi method a() { say "Second" } }; A.new.a # (named arg) Why dispatch to first method

[21:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «Second␤»

[21:42] <Voldenet> m: class A { multi method a(Str:D :$b) { say "First" }; multi method a() { say "Second" } }; A.new.a("x") # (named arg) Why dispatch to first method

[21:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller a(A: Str); none of these signatures match:␤    (A $: Str:D :$b, *%_)␤    (A $: *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «First␤»

[21:43] <timotimo> m: await do for ^64 { start { sleep 0.1 } }; say now - INIT now

[21:43] <timotimo> huh?

[21:43] <robertle> jnthn: but if you change that then the real OS thread after the await could be a different than the one before the call, right?

[21:43] <jnthn> The idea behind non-blocking await is that, when an `await` takes place on the thread pool, we instead take a continuation

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem: 335cd23715 | (Curt Tilmes)++ | META.list

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem: Move LibYAML repo to yaml github

[21:43] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem: review: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/commit/335cd23715

[21:43] <jnthn> And then, when the thing awaited on is done, the continuation is scheduled on the thread pool

[21:44] <robertle> ok, so even the perl thread could be a different one after the await?

[21:44] <jnthn> robertle: Yes, that is an upshot, which is why non-blocking await is being brought in as part of 6.d

[21:45] <jnthn> Note that this only happens on threads managed by the thread pool

[21:45] *** skids left
[21:45] <Voldenet> robertle: that's the whole point of await

[21:45] <jnthn> And if you're using a thread pool you already don't know what thread the code will run on

[21:45] <robertle> understood now. sounds cool, but also potentially a bit surprising. you don't usually expect th thread that runs your code to change ...

[21:45] <hythm> Voldenet yes I needed the define smiley :D. Thanks 

[21:45] <Voldenet> hythm: (;

[21:46] <jnthn> If you are doing something where you really need more control, and work with `Thread` directly, or if you `await` in the main program thread, then you'll get the same semantics as today

[21:46] <Voldenet> jnthn: does perl have something like AsyncLocal?

[21:48] <jnthn> Voldenet: A dynamic variable will work out for that

[21:49] <jnthn> A key difference between await in Perl 6 and await in C#, even once the non-blocking stuff happens, is that the a continuation is taken involving the whole call stack between the place that does the `await` and the thread pool

[21:49] <jnthn> Whereas in C# it's a pre-rotuine code transform

[21:49] <jnthn> *per-routine

[21:50] <jnthn> That's why there's no equivalent to `async`; we don't need one

[21:50] <jnthn> Or, arguably, the equivalent is `start` :)

[21:50] <robertle> continuations are an internal-only thing in perl6, right? I can't create a continuation in perl6 code?

[21:50] <jnthn> Correct

[21:50] <jnthn> gather/take uses them also

[21:50] *** alimon left
[21:51] <Voldenet> You technically could write your own version of await by wrapping it

[21:51] <Voldenet> and then decorating the result

[21:51] <jnthn> gather/take is also an exmaple of something where various languages have a "yield" feature that transforms a routine at compilation, whereas in Perl 6 you don't need to do that

[21:51] *** espadrine left
[21:52] <robertle> I played with gather/take, but you can't use that across threads. continuing a continuation in another thread is quite cool!

[21:52] <robertle> if you could do that in your own code...

[21:53] *** user3 left
[21:54] *** dct left
[21:54] <jnthn> A `start` block will capture the dynamic variables in scope at the point it was taken

[21:54] <Voldenet> robertle: you can kind of use gather take across threads

[21:54] <robertle> Voldenet: how? I tried that a bit...

[21:55] <jnthn> m: my $*x = 1; await start { $*x++; await Promise.in(1); $*x++ }; say $*x

[21:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[21:55] <jnthn> So I figure ^^ gets you the AsyncLocal style functionality

[21:55] <Voldenet> m: @x = gather { for ^10 -> $v { take start { $v*2 } }; say await @x

[21:55] <jnthn> Voldenet: There you're just taking a bunch of Promise objects, so all the threading happens outside of the gather/take.

[21:56] <jnthn> (Which is fine and useful)

[21:56] <jnthn> But yeah, gather/take is not intended for concurrent use

[21:56] <jnthn> The iterator pattern is inherently synchronous.

[21:56] <robertle> yeah, and shifting the promise across thread boiundarioes seems to await on it (right??)

[21:57] <jnthn> A Promise is just a data structure

[21:57] <jnthn> And await is just an operation that means "continue with the stuff after this point once the Promise is done"

[21:57] <jnthn> await actually can work on a Channel and a Supply too

[21:58] <jnthn> This lot was special cased

[21:58] <jnthn> In 6.d, instead `await` accepts anything that does the `Awaitable` role

[21:58] <robertle> jnthn: but that's what you are changing: it's no longer just waiting...

[21:58] <jnthn> (6.d.PREVIEW, I should say)

[21:59] <jnthn> Opening the doors to folks making their own things usable with await too :)

[21:59] <timotimo> it's the best kind of waiting

[21:59] <Voldenet> the best kind of waiting is fire-and-forget

[21:59] *** Cabanossi joined
[21:59] <Voldenet> ;)

[22:00] <Voldenet> m: start { say "i'm confident this will surely work" }

[22:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: ( no output )

[22:00] <Voldenet> ;-)

[22:00] <jnthn> robertle: What's changing is that await will not always mean "blocking an OS-level thread"

[22:01] <jnthn> robertle: At the end of the day, that's just a means to an end, the end being that the code after the await continues when the result is available.

[22:01] <Voldenet> eh, but why 'not always' instead of 'never'? :)

[22:01] <timotimo> the OS-level threads were already being pre-empted :P

[22:01] <timotimo> which is kind of like a continuation being taken and resumed

[22:01] <jnthn> Voldenet: No; the non-blocking behavior of await only applies if you're running code in the thread pool

[22:02] <Voldenet> ah, right, because if you're running your own thread... you're running your own thread

[22:02] <jnthn> Voldenet: This is an effort to let people who want tighter control over what thread they're on to have it, but not have to totally throw away using higher-level things like await

[22:04] <jnthn> Occasionally - like when writing native bindings - it's really important to have control over that.

[22:04] <timotimo> oh yes

[22:04] *** lizmat joined
[22:05] <jnthn> The most recent case I had was writing the SSH::LibSSH binding, where I have a single thread interacting with it, essentially running an "event loop"

[22:06] *** _kristian left
[22:06] <Voldenet> well, a lot of things have to use event loop, like renderers

[22:06] *** dct joined
[22:06] <Voldenet> + they must really have their own thread, so it's understandable

[22:06] <jnthn> Yeah, GUI stuff is also good at caring

[22:06] *** rindolf left
[22:07] <jnthn> Final note: besides the Awaitable role, there's also an Awaiter role

[22:08] <jnthn> Meaning that we should be able to do stuff like "if I call await on a GUI thread, it will make sure the result is marshalled back to the UI thread after"

[22:08] <jnthn> A bit like .Net's SynchronizationContext

[22:08] <Voldenet> and .ConfigureAwait(false)

[22:08] <Voldenet> right?

[22:08] <jnthn> Related to that, yes

[22:09] * jnthn should go and get some sleep...

[22:09] <timotimo> good rest, jnthn :)

[22:30] <hythm> I would like to call multi methods without args,and the dispatching need to happen from withing the parameters, would this be a bad practice? example to clarify:

[22:31] <hythm> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(Str :$s = $!var ) { say "First" }; multi method a(Any :$s = $!var) { say "Second" } }; A.new(var => "string").a;

[22:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «First␤»

[22:31] <hythm> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(Str :$s = $!var ) { say "First" }; multi method a(Any :$s = $!var) { say "Second" } }; A.new.a;

[22:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «Second␤»

[22:35] *** wamba left
[22:36] *** pmurias left
[22:36] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[22:36] *** mcmillhj joined
[22:38] <Voldenet> this doesn't look like a bad practice, just a bit convoluted

[22:39] <Voldenet> + depends on actual use case

[22:40] *** yqt left
[22:41] *** mcmillhj_ left
[22:41] *** mcmillhj left
[22:46] <hythm> If it will be convoluted and might give problems later I think I will not proceed this way, my intention was to keep the scripts under bin* cleaner(for example caliing methods as "$obj.method-name; instead of $obj.method-name(arg 1=> "a",...)  and hide most of the work in lib/*,in program executable, and I wanted to hide most of the work under lib/*

[22:51] <timotimo> hythm: you can have the invocant as a parameter by putting it before a : and you should be able to put a "where" constraint on it

[22:52] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(A $ where { .var ~~ Str }) { say "is string" }; multi method a(A $ where { .var ~~ Int }) { say "is int" } }; A.new(var => "hi").a; A.new(var => 99).a

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «Cannot resolve caller a(A.new(var => "hi"): ); none of these signatures match:␤    (A $: A $ where { ... }, *%_)␤    (A $: A $ where { ... }, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:52] <timotimo> actually, a subsignature could work here

[22:53] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[22:53] *** mcmillhj joined
[22:53] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(A $self(Str :$var)) { say "is string" }; multi method a(A $self(Int :$var)) { say "is int" } }; A.new(var => "hi").a; A.new(var => 99).a

[22:53] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(A $self (Str :$var)) { say "is string" }; multi method a(A $self (Int :$var)) { say "is int" } }; A.new(var => "hi").a; A.new(var => 99).a

[22:53] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var }; say A.new.Capture.perl

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «\(:var(Any))␤»

[22:54] <timotimo> haha

[22:54] <timotimo> i forgot the :

[22:54] <hythm> lol

[22:54] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(A $self (Str :$var):) { say "is string" }; multi method a(A $self (Int :$var):) { say "is int" } }; A.new(var => "hi").a; A.new(var => 99).a

[22:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «is string␤is int␤»

[22:54] <timotimo> i forgot the : in the example with "where", too

[22:55] *** kyan joined
[22:55] <hythm> I understood what you mean, gonna test that on my code timotimo

[22:55] <timotimo> m: class A { has $.var; multi method a(A $ where { $_.var ~~ Str }:) { say "is string" }; multi method a(A $ where { .var ~~ Int }:) { say "is int" } }; A.new(var => "hi").a; A.new(var => 99).a

[22:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 541597: OUTPUT: «is string␤is int␤»

[22:55] <timotimo> there you go

[22:55] <timotimo> works with one way, as well as the other
