[01:26] <tbrowder> if i want to go back and test an old rakudo release named 2017.04.3-275-g84502dc how do i get it.

[01:26] <geekosaur> git checkout 84502dc

[01:26] <tbrowder> i don't see any branches with that name. is it a tag?

[01:26] <geekosaur> it's the start of a commit hash

[01:27] <geekosaur> well. the full string is from git describe

[01:27] <geekosaur> <most recent tag before the commits>-<number of commits since then>-g<commit hash>

[01:27] <geekosaur> (the "g" is because you can import from a non-git repo; those will have hashes not prefixed with "g")

[01:28] <tbrowder> on the nom branch?

[01:28] <geekosaur> yes

[01:28] <geekosaur> or whatever branch has that tag on it

[01:29] *** colomon left

[03:44] <zengargoyle> lookatme: REPL is a work in progress and is *hard*.  it's something like every line you enter is a new scope of some sort because it's got to be compiled into a unit just like a file would be (mostly, maybe, -ish)

[03:45] <zengargoyle> some things stick around line to line, some things don't, some things need to be made 'my' to work.  etc.

[03:47] <zengargoyle> for anything non-trivial, i setup inotify to watch a file and run p6 on it whenever it changes and then just edit the file in $EDITOR in another window.

[03:49] <lookatme> zengargoyle, oh.

[03:50] <lookatme> I wonder is something different between `nqp` and other module ?

[03:50] <lookatme> use other module would be affect all lines

[08:11] <masak> can I construct a Routine at runtime, the way I can construct a class using the MOP?

[08:12] <masak> specifically, can I programmatically populate the parameter list of a Routine I'm creating?

[08:13] <melezhik> HI!

[08:14] <masak> hi, melezhik

[08:18] <masak> hm, Routine is Block is Code...

[08:18] <masak> ...which has a Signature...

[08:19] <masak> I suspect for what I want to do, I'm better off slurping in all the arguments, and then writing the checks in the routine body

[08:19] <lizmat> m: sub a() {}; BEGIN dd MY::<&a>   # was hoping that would work  :-(

[08:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7b230: OUTPUT: ¬´Nil‚ê§¬ª

[08:20] <lizmat> masak: ^^^

[08:20] <masak> expecting that to work does not seem terribly unreasonable to me

[08:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7b230: OUTPUT: ¬´Sub a = sub a () { #`(Sub|33849992) ... }‚ê§¬ª

[08:20] <lizmat> well, I guess there isn't a MY:: yet until runtime

[08:21] <masak> yeah, perhaps not

[08:21] <masak> but lexical variables definitely exist at BEGIN time :)

[13:03] <cschwenz> perl6 being 120ms slower despite doing more work is still impressive.

[13:03] <sacomo> hi #perl6

[13:04] *** raschipi left
[13:04] <sacomo> do we have any way to specify a module dependency with version in META6?

[13:05] <llfourn> sacomo: yup

[13:05] <llfourn> "depends" : ["DispatchMap","JSON5::Tiny","Terminal::ANSIColor", "JSON::Fast"],

[13:05] <llfourn> # from my META6.json

[13:05] <sacomo> I mean, the version number

[13:05] <llfourn> ugexe: ^^

[13:05] *** cgfbee joined
[13:06] <llfourn> (oh sorry I didn't see the version bit :S)

[13:06] <sacomo> something like this: "depends" : ["JSON::Fast:ver<1.2.2.2>"],

[13:06] <sacomo> np

[13:07] <llfourn> I'm not sure as where would get get the version from. Right now mostly everything is done with git so you'd have to tag the version for it to have a chance of working.

[13:08] <El_Che> fixing versions instead of minimal versions for a lib can be tricky (what happen when different libs depends on the same lib but impose different versions?)

[13:08] <llfourn> though there was some cpan integration project that I haven't looked at

[13:08] <sacomo> there is a description of the concept here http://design.perl6.org/S22.html#depends

[13:08] <sacomo> hmm

[13:08] *** lizmat joined
[13:09] <llfourn> anyways ugexe is the person who'd know for sure

[13:10] <sacomo> ok, thanks

[13:10] <sacomo> seems like that syntax from that link works for zef

[21:34] <timotimo> getc is about characters, and a single character can be many unicode codepoints

[21:35] <timotimo> perl6 is trying its best to never give you a broken-off combiner character

[21:35] <timotimo> so it dutifully waits for some kind of confirmation that there's not going to be a "combining acute" or something

[21:59] <samcv> my friend found a possible regression. it only shows when launching the script with a command line argument. and for some reason tries to open the command line argument as a file, but only at the end of execution

[22:00] <samcv> this is the file https://pastebin.com/raw/MaURicBg if you download it, and start it as perl6 deckofpain.p6 easy

[22:00] <samcv> then press enter until the end (like 10 seconds if you just hit enter) then it tries to access the filename provided "easy" which is just the mode of the file. but if you have no command line argument, $mode defaults to easy anyway

[22:00] <samcv> but it doesn't try and open the file

[22:19] <samcv> here's your problem. "mirror" is misspelled /s

[22:21] <geekosaur> several typoes in the messages indeed. there's also a "Cheching" earlier :p

[22:23] <samcv> XD

[22:23] <samcv> that's great

[22:23] <Lambd0x_> geekosaur, samcv, timotimo. I've written this log due to the fact windows PowerShell or cmd won't allow me to copy its content. The message is ok, just a few typos because I was in a hurry yesterday.

[22:24] <samcv> you can't copy?

[22:24] <timotimo> should be possible by just marking and it'll immediately be in your copy buffer

[22:24] <geekosaur> otherwise I would wonder if a proxy needs to be configured for something other than browsers

[22:25] <Lambd0x_> Well, it's Windows.

[22:25] <ugexe> looks like it happened in 0.1.18 when I added file locking to some things. you could try `perl6 -Ilib bin/zef install https://github.com/ugexe/zef/archive/v0.1.17.zip`

[22:25] <geekosaur> copy is normally in the window menu

[22:26] <Lambd0x_> geekosaur, Agreed. However a cmd or Powershell app, doesn't have this menu.

[22:26] <geekosaur> edit > mark, or control-m

[22:26] <geekosaur> er? it does here

[22:26] <geekosaur> click the icon at the left side of the titlebar

[22:27] <Lambd0x_> Ah, here is windows 8.1

[22:27] <Lambd0x_> yours?

[22:27] <geekosaur> 8.1 should still have that menu

[22:27] <geekosaur> (I'm on 10)

[22:27] <geekosaur> 8.0 I'm not sure about but 8.1 reversed some of 8.0's more questionable decisions

[22:27] <Lambd0x_> geekosaur, You're right man

[22:28] <Lambd0x_> the icon is a menu, never even dreamed about it.

[22:28] <geekosaur> and in any case control-m should work

[22:28] <Lambd0x_> Well, it will improve the report. Will get a decent copy for you guys now.
