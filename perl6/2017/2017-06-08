[01:56] <raschipi_> bioduds: the META6.json file can't even be put under copyleft, because the ecosystem manipulates it so people can browse and get the modules. That field indicates the license the rest of the software is under.

[01:56] *** atta joined
[01:58] <raschipi_> That's what those checkboxes were. Well it can be under copyleft, but then it couldn't be distributed.

[01:58] <raschipi_> The SPDX identifier will also be made mandatory at some point.

[06:48] <masak> though it's possible to argue for "civilian" names for both of these

[06:48] <masak> I'd go with something like "alternative" for `|`

[06:48] <masak> and "overlap" for `&`

[09:51] <parv> thanks jnthn.

[09:53] <rightfold> Is there a shorter form of {o.m($^a, $^b)}?

[09:57] <rightfold> Is there a way to work around the special casing that *@xs does when you don't know whether your number of arguments will be 1?

[09:58] <rightfold> For example, in: reduce &f, $x, |@xs;

[09:58] <rightfold> I suppose I should make it so that I always avoid passing multiple arguments in such case.

[09:58] <rightfold> Then I won't run into that issue ever.

[09:59] <jnthn> *@xs flattens, but **@xs doesn't

[09:59] <rightfold> *@xs does it depending on how many arguments there are and if the first one is iterable

[10:03] <rightfold> I really don't understand all this special casing wrt lists

[10:04] *** domidumont left
[10:06] <rightfold> Ok, so I have to write reduce &f, ($x, |@xs) if @xs may be empty and $x may be an empty list

[12:14] <eveo> .tell parv that's entirely incorrect tho, which is why it's best not to guess. &{Str.NFC}.signature gives you a block that calls Str.NFC and you're calling signature on that block. You could stick anything into that block and still get the same signature. The correct way is Str.^lookup('NFC').candidates».signature. You should use .candidates bit for subs too, otherwise you only get the sig of the proto

[12:48] <eveo> Why?

[12:49] <perlpilot> because it reads well I guess.

[12:49] <moritz> back in the days, we allowed calling positional arguments by name

[12:50] <moritz> during these bad old days, calling it with by => ... would have worked

[13:03] <araraloren> perlpilot, thanks. That's make sense

[13:04] <Unavowed> does this mean that the behaviour is different for subs and methods?

[13:05] <perlpilot> ding!  :-)

[13:05] <timotimo> yup, the default signature differs between subs and methods

[13:05] <timotimo> methods also have the invocant argument, which subs don't usually have

[13:05] <araraloren> m: sub f() { say %_; }; f(a => 2, c => 1);

[13:05] <timotimo> araraloren: have to drop the () after f

[13:06] <araraloren> Er..

[13:06] <Unavowed> ah, that explains it then.  thanks for the link, perlpilot 

[13:06] <timotimo> the f() says "there's a signature. it's empty", then you use %_ and it's like "that doesn't fit the signature you declared!"

[13:08] <raschipi> One thing I was bothered about, don't remember who was complaining the other day about it, is that the .& syntax for calling a subroutine as a method puts the object in the invocant, but a sub expects data to be manipulated in the rightmost positional argument.

[13:09] <perlpilot> why bothered?   That makes sense for how methods should be called.

[13:09] <araraloren> It pass parameter you provided as last parameter

[13:09] <araraloren> .&

[13:52] *** astj joined
[13:52] <raschipi> It says there's no point on using AIO on Linux for anything except for direct (unbuffered) file access. It blocks anyway for other I/O.

[13:53] <jnthn> I have no idea if that's the actual API that libuv uses

[13:53] <raschipi> Or does libuv creates worker threads?

[13:54] <jnthn> It may do for file stuff

[13:54] <jnthn> This seems to be just about file I/O, though?

[13:54] <raschipi> by "This" you mean the article or libuv?

[13:54] <jnthn> The article

[13:55] <jnthn> Most of the useful places to do async I/O are sockets and processes.

[13:55] <jnthn> We don't even *have* async file I/O support in Perl 6

[13:56] *** astj left
[13:57] <raschipi> Well, libuv was the one dealing with the standard handles, which are actually file I/O. /dev/std*

[13:58] <jnthn> raschipi: Yeah, but we were only doing file I/O or standard handle I/O with libuv in order to use its platform abstractions, not because we actually wanted to not block :)

[13:58] <jnthn> Goes without saying that we're better off not doing that :)

[13:58] <raschipi> Or a pseuterminal, which is also a file.

[13:59] <raschipi> OK, thanks, that's solves my confusion.

[14:00] <raschipi> Now it's using what for the abstraction?

[14:00] <mspo> unix socket files?

[14:02] <raschipi> "Once again, synchronous file I/O looks similar enough everywhere to not need all that much in the way of an abstraction layer." I see now. No need for an abstraction.

[15:47] <eveo> daxim: that command gives "Need a valid installation target to continue" because location is missing '#inst' part. What exactly are you running and trying to accomplish?

[15:47] <eveo> daxim: just a custom module location or entire custom perl6 location?

[15:48] <daxim> you forgot to create the directory.  it's a bug in zef that the maintainer doesn't rush to fix

[15:48] <eveo> daxim: this appears to work for me without issues:   zef --install-to=inst#/tmp/perl6 install zef; /tmp/perl6/bin/zef info Testo

[15:49] * eveo tries

[15:49] <lucasb> but, from another angle, one usually expects $obj.self to have *no* side-effects. In contrast with the ".Bool" method, which is well learned that Failures get "de-activated" in boolean contexts

[15:50] <eveo> lucasb: handled. Yes, both .Bool and .defined methods handle Failures.

[15:55] <eveo> lucasb: almost all methods called on unhandled Failures throw, so it doesn't feel all that shocking that calling .self would do the same. And the new additions solves a real problem; the alternative is using a contraption like has $.foo = ($_ :="foo".IO.mkdir) ~~ Failure ?? .throw !! $_; which with new way is written as simply: has $.foo = "foo".IO.mkdir.self;  IMO the Needs of The Real Usecase outweigh the

[15:55] <eveo> needs of some hypothetical and unlikely usecase.

[16:03] <tony-o> eveo: does it create a CURI or CURF?

[16:04] <Juerd> https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/redo uses redo without an explicit loop construct; using redo like this is valid in Perl 5, but this example does not work (in Perl 6) because "Control flow commands not allowed in toplevel"

[16:04] <Juerd> Is that a doc bug, a spec bug, or a rakudo bug? :)

[16:04] <eveo> tony-o: I've no idea. Looks like a CURI. Here's the stuff there: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/126bb143a1fd22438e158ce9fcfd8074

[16:05] <eveo> Juerd: doc bug

[16:06] <Juerd> Okay, in that case: how do I do the same thing in Perl 6? I thought of until $++ { ... }, but that's kinda obscure.

[16:07] <tony-o> i'm mostly just being grumpy eveo.  my point was that creating either is going to not be 'least surprise' to *someone*.

[16:07] <eveo> Juerd: loop { my $x = prompt("Enter a number"); last if $x ~~ /\d+/ }

[16:07] <moritz> and yes, doc bug

[16:07] <moritz> code samples from the docs should work :-)

[16:08] <eveo> daxim: building 2017.05 now to try out on it. How did you get your Perl 6? From deb packages?

[16:08] <dogbert17> moritz: there's somthing odd going on with that code snippet

[16:09] <eveo> daxim: What's in in /tmp/perl6/bin/zef ?

[16:09] <Juerd> eveo: But in my use case it doesn't make sense to label something as a loop. I only want to redo (retry).

[16:09] <eveo> cat /tmp/perl6/bin/zef

[16:09] <Juerd> eveo: I'm basically having a "goto 10", but the normal flow of the program is to run only once.

[16:09] <eveo> Juerd: sure it does: you want to loop until you have successful output :)

[16:15] <Juerd> eveo: I'm not insisting on doing it exactly the same way, but I'd like to keep a way to distinguish between two use-cases. If I want to be able to maintain my own code, I need flags to signal intentions for the future reader of my code, i.e. me.

[16:16] <Juerd> Typically I shape my code along the intended flow for regular execution

[16:16] <daxim> I gotta go afk. if you know how to make this work, just tell in the channel, I can catch up later

[16:17] <Juerd> For example, I wouldn't have an if (error) { error handling } else { rest of the program }, but a guard statement to quit the current block early.

[16:17] <eveo> mhm

[16:17] <Juerd> That's another thing I'm missing in Perl 6: I can't "last" a bare block, and "leave" is NIY. Of course I can just write subs and "return" instead.

[18:03] <lucasb> maybe... try renaming grammar VERSION and token VERSION to different names (?)

[18:03] <bioduds> let me

[18:04] <Juerd> bioduds: You used 'rule' instead of 'token', and that means whitespace becomes significant (:sigspace)

[18:05] <Juerd> bioduds: Given that, you probably shouldn't end 'Hello I am ' in whitespace like you're doing...

[18:05] <Juerd> bioduds: Likewise, don't begin and end ' and my version is ' with whitespace

[18:05] <bioduds> ops, sorry

[18:05] <bioduds> thanks Juerd

[18:05] <Juerd> Or use 'token' instead of 'rule' if you wish to only match whitespace that you explicitly put there

[20:31] <ingy> expression: operand (operator operand)*

[20:31] <ingy> operand: (paren-expr | token)

[20:32] <ingy> token: ( string | number | variable )

[20:34] <ingy> it was a tiny grammar change and the unary became just more binary

[20:35] <ingy> it might not be best for complex syntaxen

[20:37] <ingy> I'm effectively writing a TT2 grammar (and it seems that TT2 doesn't allow not as var :)

[20:46] <rightfold> Can I have a word with a space in it when I use <a b c>?

[23:02] <ugexe> installed bin scripts has no direct dependencies, so they are able to attempt to `run $real-bin-script`

[23:08] <Juerd> Is there something like Perl5's FindBin?

[23:09] *** itaipu left
[23:16] <ugexe> $?FILE.parent, $*PROGRAM.parent, etc

[23:16] <Juerd> Heh, just found that too :). $Bin becomes $*PROGRAM-NAME.IO.parent and $RealBin becomes $*PROGRAM-NAME.IO.resolve.parent

[23:17] <Juerd> Oh, $*PROGRAM, you say. Is that short for $*PROGRAM-NAME.IO?

[23:17] <Juerd> Seems to be

[23:17] <ugexe> probably just remembering wrong heh

[23:17] <timotimo> that could totally go into the perl5-to-6 document

[23:17] <timotimo> somewhere

[23:17] <timotimo> if there's any part where common modules are covered

[23:20] <Juerd> use lib "$*PROGRAM.resolve.parent()/lib";  # yay, works

[23:20] <timotimo> string concat for paths? :(

[23:21] <timotimo> hm, have we got a sibling method?

[23:21] <Juerd> I really see nothing wrong with simple string concatenation for paths at the end

[23:22] <Juerd> In practice it works just about anywhere.

[23:22] <Juerd> Especially if you don't care about win32 at all :D

[23:22] <timotimo> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/sibling

[23:23] <Juerd> I'll use that if it makes you happy :D

[23:24] <timotimo> m: say ".parent()/lib".chars; say ".sibling('lib')".chars.say

[23:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar f0c3bf: OUTPUT: «13␤15␤True␤»

[23:24] <Juerd> Oh, meh, have to stringify it myself now :(

[23:24] <timotimo> it's only two more chars to Do The Right Thing

[23:24] <timotimo> oh? we should fix the lib pragma, then

[23:24] <timotimo> to accept IO::Path, too

[23:24] <Juerd> Type check failed in binding to parameter '$spec'; expected Str but got IO::Path

[23:24] <Juerd> Or Str() it

[23:24] <timotimo> that'd be a possible fix

[23:28] *** MasterDuke left
[23:29] <timotimo> a bug report would probably be a good idea

[23:29] <Juerd> Although this common use case might even warrant a "use lib :findbin;"

[23:29] <Juerd> Or something like it. "./lib" and "../lib" are extremely common

[23:30] <Juerd> I'll report the bug

[23:31] *** skids joined
[23:39] <ugexe> lib pragma just uses a CUR, and which one it uses depends on if the file path is relative or not, if there is a meta6.json file, etc

[23:39] <Juerd> What is a CUR?

[23:39] <timotimo> CompUnit Repo

[23:40] <ugexe> and because lib/ doesn't mapped to the installation structure its not really a good practice to be putting `use lib "lib"` in your code

[23:40] <timotimo> if you have a script inside a bin/ it'll get the lib set correctly anyway, right?

[23:42] <ugexe> if you are using the typical CURFS/perl5-ish structure yes

[23:42] <Juerd> ugexe: If that's a bad practice, could you open a ticket explaining it? I can't explain it because this is new to me.

[23:44] <ugexe> Juerd: because if you install a script (in bin/) with `use lib 'lib';`, where does that point once its installed and the file structure no longer even has a lib/ folder?

[23:45] <Juerd> ugexe: I'm not familiar with anything but linux, where $*PROGRAM.resolve.parent.sibling('lib') would hold true: /usr/lib for things in /usr/bin, /usr/local/lib for things in /usr/local/bin, etc.

[23:45] <ugexe> again there is no lib/ for installed items

[23:45] <Juerd> Although come to think of it, Perl modules don't follow that structure :(

[23:45] <Juerd> ugexe: What do you mean by "there is no lib/"?

[23:46] <Juerd> Also, most of what I write never gets "installed".

[23:46] <timotimo> well, perl6 (at least rakudo) is installing modules in a way where their checksum becomes part of the filename

[23:46] <Juerd> It runs from wherever the git repository is cloned to.

[23:47] <Juerd> timotimo: That seems important for CPAN and distributed modules, not for tightly coupled "libraries" that are basically not even libraries, but just parts of my program spread over separate files.

[23:47] <timotimo> mhm

[23:47] <ugexe> why not then invoke them with -Iwhatever or PERL6LIB="..."

[23:48] <Juerd> ugexe: Because that's ugly, and because I want other users of my program to be able to run it without getting to hate Perl 6 for being hard to use... :)

[23:48] <ugexe> im not sure that you get precomp with use lib either

[23:48] <Juerd> I'm already requesting that they install Perl 6; that's about as far as I dare to go.

[23:50] <Juerd> ugexe: Yes, you do. There's now an incredibly ugly .precomp in my lib/, but I suppose I'll have to get used to that.

[23:50] <ugexe> the program not running unless they cd to a specific directory first is just as bad

[23:50] <Juerd> ugexe: Yes. That's why I'm not using "use lib 'lib';", but instead "use lib ~$*PROGRAM.resolve.sibling('lib');"

[23:50] <ugexe> just because there is a precomp folder there does not mean everything got precompiled, so im not so sure

[23:51] <Juerd> I'm adding 'resolve' because the typical way of 'installing' things like this is to symlink them to /usr/bin :)

[23:52] <Juerd> ugexe: It's not slow enough to not be precomped.

[23:52] <ugexe> well, precompiling is pretty slow

[23:54] <Juerd> It's very slow the first run, but subsequent runs are only a little slow.

[23:59] <ugexe> it would be nice if CURs could be smart enough to handle this
