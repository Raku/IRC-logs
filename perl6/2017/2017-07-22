[03:22] <goofy> Hello, I'm having a problem install IO::Socket::SSL on Windows 10 Rakudo Star version 2017.04.3.

[03:22] <goofy> I've traced it to the OpenSSL package test 02-socket. It is trying to connect to google.com on port 443 using IO::Socket::INET.new(:$host, :port(443)).

[03:22] <goofy> From the REPL: IO::Socket::INET.new(host => 'www.google.com', port => 443)  Failed to connect: connection timed out

[03:22] <goofy> However: IO::Socket::INET.new(host => 'stackoverflow.com', port => 443) connects just fine

[03:23] <goofy> More importantly, I was wanting to experiment with GTK and its build process gets the dll's from https://gtk-dlls.p6c.org/ which requires the above.

[03:24] <goofy> BTW... I'm very new to Perl so I may be doing something entirely wrong

[03:25] <MasterDuke> goofy: are you using zef to install IO::S::SSL?

[03:25] <goofy> Yes

[03:25] <MasterDuke> i think you can pass --/test to the install command to skip tests

[03:26] <goofy> I tried that and it does install. However, when I try to install GTK::Simple. GTK::Simple fails for the same reason.

[03:26] <goofy> And GTK::Simple will not build without downloading the dll files from https://gtk-dlls.p6c.org/

[03:28] <MasterDuke> i haven't installed GTK::Simple, so take this with a grain of salt, but you may be able to just clone it manually, download the dlls manually, and the do a 'zef install .' from its directory

[03:29] <goofy> I will give it a try. Thanks for the tip.

[03:29] <MasterDuke> assuming it checks whether the dlls are already present or not before trying to download them

[03:31] <Zoffix> goofy: and don't forget to report this problem on the appropriate repo so the author could fix it

[03:31] <Zoffix> buggable: eco IO::Socket::SSL

[03:31] <buggable> Zoffix, IO::Socket::SSL 'IO::Socket::SSL for Perl 6 using OpenSSL': https://github.com/sergot/io-socket-ssl

[03:36] <goofy> HA I've never reported a bug before... or even used github for that matter. This will be interesting.

[03:37] <Zoffix> There's a first time for everything :) But if you don't report it, then likely the next person to try what you're trying will have the same problem

[03:39] <goofy> From what I can tell, the issue is with IO::Socket::INET and not GTK::Simple.  GTK::Simple just happens to use IO::Socket::INET which causes it to fail. So do I report this in both or just IO::Socket::INET?

[03:45] <goofy> MasterDuke: Downloading the dependant dlls manually worked. A quick test GTK app worked as expected! Thank you.

[03:45] <Zoffix> goofy: IO::Socket::INET is a core class. If there's a failure with it you can report it like all the other Rakudo bugs, by emailing to [email@hidden.address]
[03:46] <Zoffix> And include what Rakudo version you got ( perl6 -v )

[03:47] <goofy> Zoffix: Thank you for the information.

[04:12] <zengargoyle> hythm: IIRC the buffer is used only at the end when it's faster to just linear search through the last N KB of data in memory rather than seeking back and forth to narrow it down.

[04:13] <goofy> Zoffix: Just a quick follow up. I think it is IPv6 related. If I disable IPv6 on the ethernet adapter, it works just fine. If I re-enable it, it breaks. Possibly something on my end? although other software and dev environments work normally.

[04:13] <zengargoyle> hythm: Search::Dict is pretty much a port of the p5 module of the same name (IIRC).  when benchmarking i never found where the buffer-size helped vs p6 IO at the time.

[04:16] *** mcmillhj left
[04:16] <zengargoyle> hythm: so it does binary search for a while, seek and readline, then when it's down to less than buffer-size between low and high it just searches that last bit in one go.

[04:16] <Zoffix> goofy: it might be a bug in IO::Socket::INET. It still needs a lot of love. I'd suggest reporting it; if it turns out to be not a bug, then no harm done, but if it is, then we can fix it.

[04:18] * Zoffix goes to bed

[04:18] <Zoffix> \o

[04:20] <zengargoyle> hythm: i meant you could maybe use the binary search algo from Search::Dict to find your start-time.  i don't see how you could actually use Search::Dict as-is.  it only matches against *whole* lines.

[04:21] <zengargoyle> (and probably only works on ascii data and would barf on unicode when it seeks into the middle of a character...)

[13:12] <masak> moritz: congrats on the book! <3

[13:13] * masak doesn't know why he wrote "<3" when Unicode Is Your Friend: "♥"

[13:14] <masak> um... under what conditions is a lib/ directory with a .precomp/ directory created for me when I run a Perl 6 script? :/

[13:15] <masak> fortunately, I already have .precomp directories git-ignored, so it doesn't show up. but I was still surprised to find a lib/ that I hadn't myself created...

[13:15] <moritz> masak: thanks

[13:16] <jnthn> Odd, maybe it's a side-effect of `use lib` or -Ilib or some such?

[13:16] <moritz> masak: re precomp, I think on first execution of a script that loads the module; maybe related to whether other locations are writable to you

[13:16] <jnthn> moritz: Yeah, I think masak is saying there isn't a module and wasn't a lib directory at all before though

[13:17] <masak> jnthn: the only thing I `use` in that script is Test.pm6

[13:17] <jnthn> Hm, odd

[13:18] <masak> but when I try to reproduce that in a script somewhere else, that's not enough. still looking.

[13:18] <jnthn> And if you delete it and run the script again it comes back?

[13:18] <jnthn> Do you have a PERL6LIB in your env?

[13:19] <masak> oh!

[13:19] <masak> I do!

[13:19] <masak> good deduction

[13:19] <masak> if I delete it and run again, it comes back, yes

[13:19] <masak> it does not seem to be created in an env without PERL6LIB set

[13:20] <jnthn> So, mystery solved-ish :)

[13:21] <masak> ...and I had PERL6LIB set to 'lib', essentially a relative path

[13:21] <masak> but in this case I was in a subdirectory, which did not have a lib/

[13:21] *** ufobat joined
[13:21] *** ufobat left
[13:21] <masak> I guess it's debatable whether perl6 should ever create the PERL6LIB path if it's not there

[13:22] <masak> I would prefer it didn't, even if that meant no caching ;)

[13:22] <jnthn> I guess what it really wants is the .precomp folder there, and it creates it up-front, possibly because it avoids a bunch of existence checks down the road.

[13:22] <jnthn> But I don't know the code's current form well enough to make a judgement on that :)

[13:24] <jnthn> I've a slight preference for it not to create it also, though. And it's possible it's more accident than design.

[13:30] *** nadim joined
[13:34] *** lucasb left
[13:46] <nine> I happen to know the author of that code somewhat well enough to claim that it's probably by accident

[13:48] <nine> Well it just tries to create the .precomp directory but our mkdir is really an mkpath.

[13:49] * nine never was really a fan of that and would have liked to see an explicit mkpath method in addition instead

[14:07] <Zoffix> andreoss: if you want the `use` really really hard. You could use the unofficial and unsupported slang interface to modify what `use` module loading pragma does and do it a sub instead. ^ that module has an example of how to do that

[14:53] <Aaronepower> Can anyone explain to me this "expecting any of: colon pair" in a string error? https://gist.github.com/Aaronepower/8b6d7e565a23977f18a9f2efe20994f3

[14:54] <AlexDaniel> m: say "{25 + 5}"

[14:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb7ecb: OUTPUT: «30␤»

[14:54] <Aaronepower> I tried escaping the colon, but apparently that just made the compiler more confused.

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> Aaronepower: try qq:!c and see if it helps

[14:56] <Aaronepower> What does that do?

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> Aaronepower: {} in double quotes are understood as code blocks

[14:56] <Aaronepower> AlexDaniel: Ah!

[14:56] <Aaronepower> AlexDaniel: Yep, that worked thanks!

[14:57] <AlexDaniel> Aaronepower: and :c tells it if this should happen or not. By default it's on it double quotes (or qq)

[15:01] <Aaronepower> AlexDaniel: Thank you. Also how do you remove all whitespace from a string?

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘ hello   world  ’.subst(:g, /\s/, ‘’)

[15:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb7ecb: OUTPUT: «helloworld␤»

[15:02] <Aaronepower> AlexDaniel: Why do you those style of quotes?

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> Aaronepower: you don't have to. You can use '' or ""

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> Aaronepower: I prefer them because I can nest them, and I find them easier to read

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> m: say “hello “world””

[15:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb7ecb: OUTPUT: «hello “world”␤»

[15:05] * Zoffix is -1 on :?

[15:05] <Zoffix> Pointlessly making an already complex feature more complex

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: no, it's making it consistent

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> m: say ?25

[15:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb7ecb: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[15:05] <AlexDaniel> m: say !25

[15:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar fb7ecb: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[15:05] <Zoffix> But :! is not a colon followed by an operator. It's actual syntax

[15:06] *** silug joined
[15:06] <AlexDaniel> this doesn't really matter

[15:06] <Zoffix> By that logic :+42foo should work too

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> not really?

[15:06] <Zoffix> And we might need an extra syntax in the future, so why waste it on something useless

[15:06] <AlexDaniel> oh gosh…

[15:07] <Zoffix> oh gosh what?

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> :?foo will never be used for anything else because it is natural to assume that it gives you a * => True pair

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> in fact, I almost edited the page being completely sure that it does work

[15:08] <AlexDaniel> and then decided to try it, surprise-surprise!

[15:09] <Zoffix> If you're going to suggest we need to lock in :?foo syntax for pointless feature because :!foo looks like a prefix ! op and we have ? prefix op too, I don't understand why you don't think :+42foo or :-42foo shouldn't work, since we have + and - prefix ops

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> because ! gives me falsy things, and normally I can use ? to mean the opposite

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> it's not so much about “prefix”

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> ops*

[15:10] <Zoffix> - gives me negative things, and normally I can use + to mean the opposite

[15:11] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: sure. Are there any places where + doesn't work like you expect when - does?

[15:12] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: nope. Just like ? works any place where I expect ! to work.

[15:12] <AlexDaniel> except :?foo

[15:13] <AlexDaniel> unless you don't expect :!foo to work, but that's a whole different thing :)

[15:13] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: it's not a ! in :!foo. It's ":!". By your logic it should be possible to write ?? !! as !! ?? to mean the inverse

[15:13] <Zoffix> Colon pairs are probably the most complex syntax feature of the language. Expanding it even further for zero practical benefit is just stupid.

[15:13] * Zoffix &

[15:14] <AlexDaniel> heh, that's an interesting take on !! ?? :)

[15:25] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: as masak++ has once put it: “"strangely consistent" is all about using loose connections people have in their brains, so that a feature feels syntactically vaguely right for various reasons. your proposal does the opposite.”

[15:26] <AlexDaniel> that's probably exactly what I wanted to say instead of the gibberish I produced :)

[16:17] <moritz> eater: search for ':my $*' in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp and then further occurrences of these variables

[16:20] *** zakharyas left
[16:21] <arnsholt> In a nutshell <?{ CODE }> is a zero-width assertion that succeeds if CODE returns a true value, and fails if not

[16:26] <eater> altho that means if I want to have it set a length limit that it needs to be executed as many times as the length is?

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> eater: no, simply tells it not to backtrack

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> eater: if you're using | then LTM is already implied

[17:08] <zengargoyle> probably my fault for starting with the BNF? grammar in the .y file w/o trying to re-write it into more grammar-ish from the start.

[17:08] *** ufobat left
[17:09] <AlexDaniel> but it seems that backtracking is defined as something that happens across regexes/tokens, so inside one regex it is allowed even with :r

[17:14] <AlexDaniel> it's very aggressive about it

[17:14] <zengargoyle> but it's not backtracking, it's still going forward from the 'oo' first match.

[17:15] <zengargoyle> it's only backtracking if it undoes the 'oo' match to try something else.  i'm thinking...

[17:16] <zengargoyle> isn't there a 'cut' like operator that actually means fail if you got this far and don't finish....

[17:27] <eater> maybe we can compare to diff langauges?

[17:28] <zengargoyle> somehow i still think it's related to the candidate match only growing.  things like <?{}> get fired twice because they're that sort of action thingy, but the actual match never shrinks in size.  so yeah maybe definition of 'backtracking'

[17:41] <eater> but if you make it non-greedy, it works

[17:41] <eater> hmmmm

[17:41] <zengargoyle> i think <?{}> is zero-width so doesn't count for backtracking.

[17:42] <eater> even if it did, backtracking is still being done over [ || ], even when they're 2 levels deep

[19:42] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: re strangely consistent wasn't Zoffix just proposing not adding something we don't need?

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: yes, but what do you mean?

[19:46] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: I don't think we should add something just for strange consistency

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: well, what we have now is strange inconsistency

[19:49] *** itaipu joined
[19:50] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: but I'm not against discussing the topic properly. Maybe indeed it's not that good of an idea, just please no irrelevant nonsense

[19:52] <AlexDaniel> fwiw, the change itself is a tiny 2 line patch

[19:54] <pmurias> what would :?foo do?

[19:56] <AlexDaniel> the opposite of :!foo

[19:56] <AlexDaniel> I would have expected :foo to be a shortcut for :?foo, but you know :) Got them other way round

[19:57] <pmurias> :?foo would be just a worse form of :foo

[19:58] <pmurias> I don't see ? as an opposite of !

[19:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b14721: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> too bad we have this then

[19:59] <pmurias> I see ? as the "is this true?" operator not as a double negation

[20:00] <AlexDaniel> that's an interesting point, I've never thought about it this way

[20:00] <AlexDaniel> like, to me ? was the commonly missing counterpart for !

[20:00] <timotimo> no, ! is the opposite of ?

[20:00] <timotimo> :P

[20:01] <Skarsnik> :?foo is not like optionnal parameter foo? xD

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> on the other hand, we don't have ! in regexes

[20:09] *** cdg_ left
[20:09] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: anyway I feel that just being strangely consistent is not a reason to add something, in programming languages there are always things that you can imagine how they would work and are not allowed

[20:10] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: true, but why not allow them if it's so easy?

[20:10] <pmurias> because they are useless

[20:10] <geekosaur> maintenance costs down the road, for one

[20:11] *** emeric joined
[20:11] <geekosaur> sounds YAGNI to me

[20:11] <pmurias> and strange consistentcy is subjective

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> /o\ come on, that's not a feature that requires hundreds lines of code

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> we've just spent more time discussing it than we'd have to spend to maintain the damn thing

[20:14] <pmurias> why would anyone ever use :?foo?

[20:15] <AlexDaniel> Interestingly, ?/! in signatures is probably the side effect of having positional parameters required by default and named parameters not required. With both ?/! you can switch back and forth

[20:15] <Skarsnik> Did you discuss some defined operator? like to replace stuff like if $foo.defined and $foo < 6 ?

[20:16] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: no, pairs

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> m: say (:!foo)

[20:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar b14721: OUTPUT: «foo => False␤»

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> therefore…

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> m: say (:!foo) # ?

[20:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar b14721: OUTPUT: «foo => False␤»

[20:17] <AlexDaniel> m: say (:?foo) # ?

[20:17] <Skarsnik> Ok, carry on

[20:18] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: one could be aligning the code vertically, but then you could say that a space or an unspace will do :)

[20:18] <AlexDaniel> oh, unspace won't…

[20:20] <AlexDaniel> for me the learning itself makes a good point. Like, once you understand that ? is used somewhere like this, then you immediatelly know about prefix:<?> and ! for required named args

[20:22] <AlexDaniel> 20 minutes ago I didn't really know about required named args (I should've seen them somewhere, but it never really crossed my mind), now I do :)

[20:22] <AlexDaniel> or maybe I did, I don't know now… given that I was assuming that you can switch from ? to ! and other way round, I guess I knew?

[20:25] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: you assume that everyone views ? as an opposite of ! (double negation)

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> well, I view it as non-negation, but I understand it in a weird way

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> I assume people view ? and ! as two opposite things though, yes

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> especially when this pattern is established by two precendents

[20:32] *** alexi5_ joined
[20:33] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: have two what?

[20:34] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: well, two cases when ? does the opposite of !

[20:34] <Zoffix> "that's not a feature that requires hundreds lines of code "

[20:34] <Zoffix> Maintenance isn't about writing initial code. 

[20:35] <Zoffix> It's everything that happens after. Like some conflict in interaction of features.

[20:36] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: ^ there is a formal ambiguity in that code. How can you guarantee you're not introducing the same shit elsewhere with your proposal?

[20:36] <Zoffix> Stop adding features just because you can. There's a word for it: featuritis.

[20:37] <AlexDaniel> well, given enough effort you can reject any feature also

[20:37] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel: as for "now we have two". There's a big difference: $foo! actually does something useful. :?foo doesn't

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> blargh

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> like talking to a wall

[20:38] <AlexDaniel> does $foo actually do something useful?

[20:38] <Zoffix> As for wasting time talking instead of writing features we don't need. We could instead use that time fix existing bugs.

[20:39] <Zoffix> You were the proponent of adding ≤ and ≥. How about you fix their bugs first instead of adding more stuff?

[20:39] <AlexDaniel> I mean, :$foo! is, but $foo …

[20:40] <AlexDaniel> you mean the PERF one?

[20:40] <Zoffix> Yes.

[20:41] <AlexDaniel> oops, I seem to have missed the ! in both messages :)

[20:42] <Zoffix> As for talking to the wall: you haven't responded to the critique of your proposal: how do you guarantee it will be a bening consistency-enhansing quirky code that works instead of creating ambiguity in some construct that will require workaround, like the ambiguity in <> arrays and reduce ops

[20:42] *** domidumont left
[20:43] <AlexDaniel> well, I also haven't seen any ambiguity yet

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> mainly because I've *just* submitted the ticket…

[20:43] <Zoffix> You want to alter a feature used all over the entire language by adding functionality that will be documented as "but there's no reason to do this"

[20:43] <AlexDaniel> and also “how do you guarantee there are no bugs”, well, you know the technically correct answer to that /o\

[20:44] <Zoffix> Design flaw isn't a technical bug. It's a flaw in design.

[20:44] <AlexDaniel> well there's no reason to do $bar? also

[20:44] <AlexDaniel> ok enough

[20:45] <Zoffix> You can't fix a design flaw by replacing broken code. You often have to continue to support.

[20:45] <Zoffix> is-deeply is a case in point

[20:47] <Zoffix> Or even better case in point: &is   Its design was taken from Perl 5, but in Perl 6 it's nearly useless and almost always a wrong routine to use for testing.

[21:18] <dugword> Hey all, I noticed some odd behavior in my perl6 program

[21:18] <dugword> I have an array and I am trying to flatten it so I can pass it into a sub.

[21:18] <dugword> However, when I use the pipe "|" prefix operator to flatten it one of my values gets changed from (Any) to (Mu) like this:

[21:18] <dugword> my $op = [Any, "NULL", "null", Any, Any, Any]

[21:18] <dugword> say |$op

[21:18] <evalable6> dugword, rakudo-moar b147217ed: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) 04===SORRY!04=== Error while compiling /tmp/3rg2WU8jnM␤Variable '$op' is not declared␤at /tmp/3rg2WU8jnM:1␤------> 03say |08⏏04$op»

[21:18] <dugword> # (Any)NULLnull(Mu)(Any)(Any)

[21:18] <dugword> say $op.values

[21:18] <dugword> # ((Any) NULL null (Any) (Any) (Any))

[21:18] <dugword> I cannot replicate this quirk outside of my very large program (2428 lines of code in a single file translated from an archaic perl5 program), so I'm sure theres some weird state I have created.

[21:18] <dugword> But should this ever be possible? And are there any ways I can inspect the values of the $op array to see if I have something odd going on?

[21:18] <dugword> I have a work around to get my program working, but it seems goofy I would get different results from using "|" and I am curious if this might be a perl6 bug.

[21:19] <zengargoyle> so ² is first a Number and parses as such, then there is a *special* case that /^¹²³.../ are operators and also multiple Nu's get turned into an actual Int power.  go figure.

[21:20] <AlexDaniel> dugword: so you get only one Mu?

[21:20] <dugword> Yeah

[21:20] <Skarsnik> that prety weird lol

[21:20] <zengargoyle> i'd also think :?$foo  would boolify into foo=>True or foo=>False.

[21:20] <dugword> Right, lol

[21:20] <zengargoyle> if say $foo were "hello"

[21:28] <Skarsnik> but I did not updated gumbo, but it does not happend too in travis

[21:28] *** jameslenz left
[21:29] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: :O IT WORKS!

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> yess

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: should we add it as a stress test in Gumbo repo?

[21:30] <BenGoldberg> m: print 'Look, a μ';

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar b14721: OUTPUT: «Look, a μ»

[21:31] <Skarsnik> hm

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: ah wait, it didn't go away

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> just reproduced it…

[21:31] <Skarsnik> Oo

[21:31] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: ok, if I give you ssh access to a machine where this happens, will you be able to take a look?

[21:31] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: I looked it up, the unicode exponents had a bug of their own

[21:31] <dugword> https://github.com/dugword/perl-Convert-ASN1/blob/master/lib/Convert/ASN1P6.pm6#L1100 That's where I am seeing the oddness 

[21:32] <Skarsnik> I don't think I can do something about it, the perl6 code is pretty simple

[21:32] <Skarsnik> and I quite sleepy now x)

[21:33] <dugword> If you clone the repo and run `perl6 t/00prim.t` you'll see the output where the quirk is right near the end

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: well, I guess you fixed both bugs then at the same time https://gist.github.com/c91a1cb511e2e1424c686e4e9459b4fc https://gist.github.com/a49301c13e12991d2819afc8572976c5

[21:33] <Skarsnik> But yeah, feel free to add it to the gumbo rep and travis

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: wrong gist, this one: https://gist.github.com/6e47f7aaf6803e6d8c2503a5a62098bd

[21:34] <AlexDaniel> damn, not this one also :)

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> this and this https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/6e47f7aaf6803e6d8c2503a5a62098bd https://gist.github.com/Whateverable/3c398c9284f3438c1c5123c6c04185bc

[21:38] <Skarsnik> AlexDaniel, maybe you can paste your gumbo version in the issue?

[21:40] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: hm, zef says just “Gumbo:auth('Sylvain Colinet')”

[21:40] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: right, because the version is just "*"

[21:41] <Skarsnik> I mean the C lib

[21:41] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: 0.10.1+dfsg-2.1

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> from the debian package

[21:42] <Skarsnik> is that testing?

[21:42] <AlexDaniel> yes

[21:43] <AlexDaniel> there's no newer version than that

[21:44] <AlexDaniel> dugword: ok, reproduced

[21:44] <dugword> Woo!

[21:45] <Skarsnik> I only installed the lib from source

[21:45] <Skarsnik> since it's not in stable :(

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> dugword: interesting. “say” shows no Mu-s, “.perl” also

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> but if you flatten, then there are Mu-s :)

[21:49] <MasterDuke> @$op doesn't have Mus, but |$op does

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> yup, even dd gives no Mus

[21:49] <Skarsnik> root@debian:/home/skarsnik/perl6# rakudo/install/bin/perl6 -I perl6-gumbo/lib/ -I exemel/lib/ crashgumbo.p6 

[21:49] <Skarsnik> should've crashed before reaching this

[21:50] <dugword> Yeah it took a while to find where the Mu was coming from when I saw it later in the program 

[21:51] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: you think I should try compiling it from source?

[21:51] <Skarsnik> I am just testing with the same version from debian than you

[21:52] <Skarsnik> Linux debian 4.3.0-1-686 #1 SMP Debian 4.3.3-2 (2015-12-17) i686 GNU/Linux

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.43-2+deb8u2 (2017-06-26) x86_64 GNU/Linux

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> but I don't think it should matter much

[21:53] <Skarsnik> This is Rakudo version 2017.06-133-ga7b2304 built on MoarVM version 2017.06-29-ga51ba62

[21:53] <Skarsnik> this is confusing

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> This is Rakudo version 2017.07-11-g91be8bc1c built on MoarVM version 2017.07

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> but I've been having this issue for several months now

[21:54] <AlexDaniel> like, since I reported it, and probably even earlier

[21:55] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: you sure you don't want ssh access? :)

[21:58] <Skarsnik> I just realised something

[21:58] <Skarsnik> it does not show something

[21:59] <Skarsnik> .say for parse-html($response).root.elements(:TAG<a>, :RECURSE);

[21:59] <Skarsnik>  show nothing on my 32 bit vm

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: I see a lot of output

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> dugword: this is a very interesting issue. Maybe you should start deleting code until you golf it down?

[22:02] <samcv> i found a decent way to seed srand if you want a more random seed

[22:02] <samcv> srand (qx{od -An -N4 -i /dev/random}.trim + qx{od -An -N4 -i /dev/random}.trim +< 32);

[22:02] <samcv> will read a 64 bit integer from /dev/random and set that as the seed

[22:02] <Skarsnik> Hoo no curl on this

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> samcv: this can hang for quite a bit if you exhaust it, I think

[22:03] <samcv> it's only getting a 64 bit integer. it only reads 8 bytes

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> samcv: this doesn't mean that there are 8 bytes readily available :)

[22:03] <samcv> too bad :P

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> but the chances are good, yes

[22:04] <Skarsnik> aaah

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: are you sure?

[22:15] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: because if so, then I can bisect it

[22:16] <Skarsnik> I am doing that

[22:16] <Skarsnik> well bisecting only with release

[22:16] <Skarsnik> since I have them all compiled

[22:16] <samcv> hmm maybe i should do that

[22:16] <samcv> is there some way i can automate that tho

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> well, this particular one I can do with bisectable

[22:17] <samcv> how much space does bisectable need

[22:17] <AlexDaniel> 60 GiB or so

[22:17] <samcv> hm

[22:17] <samcv> well i don't have that much

[22:18] <AlexDaniel> but most of the time you don't need to bisect as much

[22:18] <AlexDaniel> so maybe under 15 GiB

[22:18] <Skarsnik> https://gist.github.com/Skarsnik/9e66ab5fcad4e2ed2b8fb4f34bd92d22

[22:18] <Skarsnik> I have a texte file with rakudo release listed x)

[22:18] <Skarsnik> probably could ask github to get them

[22:19] <samcv> i wish i had a texte file. i only have text files :(

[22:19] <AlexDaniel> a better question is why would you need this if there's bisectable :)

[22:19] <samcv> because it could be down

[22:19] <samcv> or i want to run more extended tests

[22:20] <samcv> and i like being self sufficient

[22:20] <samcv> Skarsnik, can i get your rakudoversion.txt?

[22:21] *** itaipu left
[22:21] <AlexDaniel> samcv: in theory, I can write a script tha would bisect locally, but pull builds that are already available

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> if not, it can always downgrade to building rakudo locally, right? :)

[22:21] <samcv> appimages of all releases would be nice too

[22:21] <AlexDaniel> oh, or that

[22:22] <samcv> but i'm lazy and don't have time to do that atm

[22:22] <Skarsnik> https://gist.github.com/Skarsnik/9e66ab5fcad4e2ed2b8fb4f34bd92d22

[22:22] <Skarsnik> should have the rakudoversion.txt file

[22:22] <Skarsnik> 2016.06 crash too

[22:23] <Skarsnik> running old version of rakudo is so slow lol

[22:24] <samcv> your file has a syntax errror

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> samcv: in theory, appimages are not strictly required in this particular case, I think

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> it's built somewhere in /tmp, so sure enough should be installable on most systems :)

[22:25] <AlexDaniel> unless you have different architecture or something

[22:37] <Skarsnik> skarsnik@vps300582:~/perl6/benchmark$ 

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: the real problem of bisecting like this is modules and dependencies

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> and also precomp files :)

[22:39] <Skarsnik> I think they get redone when you give a path like this?

[22:39] <AlexDaniel> hm, maybe. I should make it easier for sure

[22:40] *** Guest90987 left
[22:40] <Skarsnik> and if I remember correctly pre comp is... something around these releases

[22:44] <ugexe> if you pass callbacks into a native lib you might want to try HEAD

[22:48] <Skarsnik> pre comp is very slow around that

[23:26] <Skarsnik> AlexDaniel, dunno add these commit info to the ticket on RT and ping someone that more knowlegeable?

[23:30] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: well, the first part is already done…

[23:31] <Skarsnik> It's funny because I ran a script that did 40 parse and it never crash (but it leaked in the XML module code)

[23:34] <Skarsnik> AlexDaniel, for funsie call parse-html once and call elements() lot of time and watch the memory usage of the script

[23:34] <Skarsnik> (on a sizeable html page)

[23:34] <Skarsnik> I stopped my VM

[23:34] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: is it so on the most recent rakudo also?

[23:35] <Skarsnik> I dunno, I wanted to try but realise I closed the VM xD

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: well, I don't know… Some of the commits touched garbage collection

[23:36] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: so there's a chance that the answer is no there at all

[23:37] <Skarsnik> https://gist.github.com/Skarsnik/03b970d2a4b827ba1e1d let see

[23:37] <jnthn> iirc the commits in question fixed a bug where some objects were not collected that should have been, leading to a leak

[23:37] <jnthn> This could have hidden bugs in NativeCall-using code that was not keeping hold of objects for the duration that C code that was passed them needed them

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: any chance that it collects things that should not be collected?

[23:38] <jnthn> Very low

[23:38] <jnthn> Well, in the "becuase MoarVM bug" sense

[23:39] <jnthn> However, if you allocate an object instance of CStruct REPR and pass that to C land, and the C code stashes it away somewhere, then you don't keep hold of the object you passed so long as the C code needs it, then the GC will nom it and free the memory the C code would like to have.
