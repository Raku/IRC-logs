[00:38] <samcv> 🤪 Grinning Face With Crazy Eyes

[00:39] <samcv> also Breast-Feeding 

[00:39] <samcv> i want to know if that will be usable with ZWJ sequences

[00:39] <samcv> so you can have like a whole family breastfeeding of whatever genders and skin color you want

[00:39] <dalek> doc: dcf1498 | (Tom Browder)++ | doc/Language/operators.pod6:

[00:41] <samcv> they're adding merperson. wow

[00:41] <samcv> child and adult. interesting

[00:42] <samcv> not sure how that's different from the man emoji or woman emoji. but who doesn't love more unicode characters am i right

[00:42] * samcv checks to see if they are adding any more matching brackets

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> samcv: or rather… breastfeeding with exploding head

[00:42] <samcv> well so far they don't have like emotion cambiners

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> samcv: where's the list?

[00:43] <samcv> http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html

[00:43] <AlexDaniel> samcv: huh? Isn't it what ZWJ is for?

[00:43] <samcv> well. i mean they _could_ add that in the future

[00:43] <samcv> but there are defined combinations, like doctor, whatever firefighter maybe something

[00:43] <samcv> and then use ZWJ to do gender and or skin color

[00:44] <samcv> they adding dinosaur emoji nice

[00:44] *** pyrimidi_ left
[00:44] <AlexDaniel> “merperson” xD

[00:44] <timotimo> with feathers or without?

[00:44] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: font authors decide

[00:44] <samcv> yep

[00:44] <timotimo> i hope they decide right.

[00:45] <samcv> the only reason they have pictures on the site for emoji

[00:45] <samcv> is so people don't all implement it totally differently

[00:45] *** pyrimidine joined
[00:45] <timotimo> hmm

[00:45] <samcv> i think companies stopped them adding the rifle emoji

[00:45] <rightfold> Is there a nice way to do lcfirst?

[00:45] <samcv> i remember microsoft turned the pistol into a ray gun

[00:45] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘hello’.tc

[00:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«Hello␤»

[00:45] <samcv> which is retarded. could cause like. miscommunication

[00:45] <samcv> it's a gun. not a toy

[00:46] <rightfold> AlexDaniel: that's like ucfirst

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> oh…

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> … lcfirst? :o

[00:46] <AlexDaniel> .oO( whhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? )

[00:47] <rightfold> I want to lowercase the first letter of a string.

[00:47] <samcv> oh AlexDaniel looks like you can combine crying face with baby. to make crying baby

[00:47] * samcv doesn't see it on the zwj emoji list

[00:48] <AlexDaniel> samcv: yea, I know! There are other combinations too!

[00:48] <samcv> should still be fine if you check the Grapheme_Cluster_Break property tho

[00:48] <timotimo> "unicode first"

[00:48] <timotimo> samcv: i didn't realize babies come in non-crying variants

[00:48] <samcv> also country flags can be three characters with no ZWJ

[00:48] <samcv> true

[00:49] <samcv> also need to somehow magically be able to be able to use \c[ ] with ZWJ

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x = ‘HELLO’; say $x.substr-rw(0,1) = $x.substr(0, 1).lc; say $x

[00:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«h␤hELLO␤»

[00:49] <samcv> gonna be crazy

[00:49] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x = ‘HELLO’; $x.substr-rw(0,1) = $x.substr(0, 1).lc; say $x

[00:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«hELLO␤»

[00:49] <samcv> tho i'm not looking forward to implementation at all

[00:50] <samcv> m: "🤹🏿‍♀️".uniname

[00:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: ( no output )

[00:50] <samcv> m: "🤹🏿‍♀️".uniname.say

[00:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«JUGGLING␤»

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> samcv: there's a ticket for ZWJ though

[00:50] <samcv> for which part of support

[00:50] <samcv> grapheme count and character counting? or like

[00:50] <geekosaur> rightfold, afaik there is no special localization needed for initial lowercase, so it doesn't need a special method (yes, there are locales where initial capital is not the same as just uppercasing the first character)

[00:50] <samcv> \c[ ] whatever

[00:50] <AlexDaniel> samcv: RT #127048

[00:50] <synopsebot6> Link:  https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127048

[00:51] <samcv> initial lowercase? 1st character or what geekosaur 

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x = ‘HELLO’; $_ = .lc with $x.substr-rw(0, 1); say $x

[00:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«hELLO␤»

[00:52] <AlexDaniel> that's the shortest one I can come up with

[00:53] *** Ven joined
[00:54] <samcv> also geekosaur that is not true

[00:54] <samcv> if you mean lowercasing the first character. not true

[00:54] <samcv> Introduce an explicit dot above when lowercasing capital I's and J's

[00:54] <samcv> # whenever there are more accents above.

[00:54] <samcv> lithuanian

[00:54] <rightfold> I'll go with $name.substr(0, 1).lc ~ $name.substr(1), thanks

[00:55] <geekosaur> in that case maybe we do need an lcfirst type method

[00:55] <geekosaur> ...shoulda known. l10n is /o\

[00:55] <samcv> do we though

[00:56] <samcv> i mean. lithuanian and some other languages have special rules but we don't have any localized casing changes implemented

[00:56] <samcv> but adding lcfirst would be fine i guess

[00:59] <AlexDaniel> that's how it looks like?

[00:59] <timotimo> clearly we need q:turkish"..."

[00:59] <yoleaux> U+0030 DIGIT ZERO [Nd] (0)

[00:59] <samcv> looks like an error AlexDaniel ?

[00:59] <yoleaux> U+0033 DIGIT THREE [Nd] (3)

[00:59] <psch_> oh phooey

[01:00] <samcv> yes timotimo quite

[01:00] <AlexDaniel> u: U+0307

[01:00] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE [Mn] (◌̇)

[01:00] *** holli left
[01:01] <AlexDaniel> hmm I wonder if they have any justification for adding an orange heart

[01:01] <psch> samcv: so what would be correct for turkish?

[01:01] <samcv> the dot should be removed

[01:01] <AlexDaniel> u: HEART

[01:01] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+2619 REVERSED ROTATED FLORAL HEART BULLET [So] (☙)

[01:01] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+2661 WHITE HEART SUIT [So] (♡)

[01:01] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+2665 BLACK HEART SUIT [So] (♥)

[01:01] <samcv> cause 'i' is already dotted

[01:01] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, https://gist.github.com/5d4e285646bad95ad00c724ec9288e01

[01:01] <samcv> so just a plain letter i

[01:01] <samcv> İ => i

[01:02] <psch> samcv: i don't see how that's specific to turkish?  or is "I".lc that one "i" without the dot..?

[01:02] <samcv> unicode says it is

[01:02] <timotimo> did you hear about german getting an actual upper case sharp s to be used in common practice now?

[01:02] <psch> oh, okay.  i'm not aware of any locale specific parts of unicode

[01:02] <psch> (or much of unicode itself either, tbqh)

[01:03] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: is there any character for it?

[01:03] <timotimo> yes

[01:03] <samcv> timotimo, like not SS anymore?

[01:03] <samcv> ooo

[01:03] <samcv> hot

[01:03] <timotimo> ß vs ẞ

[01:03] <psch> AlexDaniel: the new bit is just that the capital sz is orthogonally correct now

[01:03] <psch> or, well, whenever that bit passes whatever it has to pass i suppose

[01:03] <timotimo> yes we no longer have to turn ß into SS when uppercasing

[01:04] <timotimo> ... or Ss?

[01:04] <timotimo> like, i have no clue. it's terrible anyway

[01:04] <psch> the wicked part was how they tried to remove it completely and then backpedaled, imo

[01:04] <psch> like, *why*

[01:04] <samcv> also unicode specifically says unless it's turkish to keep the dot

[01:04] <samcv> because idk they are pretty smart though. when it comes to anticipates problems

[01:04] <psch> samcv: right, that means we need some locale mechanism i guess?  not sure that shouldn't be module space though

[01:05] <AlexDaniel> u: ßẞ

[01:05] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S [Lu] (ẞ)

[01:05] <unicodable6> AlexDaniel, U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S [Ll] (ß)

[01:05] <samcv> naw module sounds horrible

[01:05] <samcv> we can and should do it in moarvvm

[01:05] <samcv> ack imagining a module to do that. horrible.

[01:06] <timotimo> doesn't sound so terrible to me, honestly?

[01:06] <rightfold> More PureScript preprocessors :) https://glot.io/snippets/elreyb4mfl

[01:06] <samcv> i mean we already hold special cases

[01:06] *** Ven left
[01:06] <samcv> it would be easy to define a locale conditional to check if the locale is set

[01:06] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘ß’.uc; say ‘ß’.tc; say ‘ẞ’.lc; say ‘ẞ’.tc

[01:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar d7cd5d: OUTPUT«SS␤Ss␤ß␤ẞ␤»

[01:07] <samcv> so i don't see why we shouldn't add it, since moarvm is already the unicode database

[01:07] *** holli joined
[01:07] <timotimo> i can imagine having a system locale setting change what I will lc to and what i will uc to in anything perl6 does

[01:08] <samcv> anything?

[01:08] <samcv> why not per string or set to the scope?

[01:11] <timotimo> oh

[01:11] <timotimo> well that'd be possible

[01:11] <psch> a pragma (or module) sounds saner to me, fwiw

[01:11] <timotimo> i misread your suggestion with the "locale conditional" to mean system locale setting

[01:12] <psch> although i guess q:locale<foo>// is probably workable as well

[01:12] *** Ven joined
[01:13] <timotimo> it might be as easy as mixing in a role that uses different lc and uc and other methods

[01:39] <pjablonski> Strange question, that I feel like I've had before.  What would cause the REPL to silently fail?  As in, $ perl6 just hangs forever until it gets ^C, without printing anything

[01:39] <pjablonski> Running source files still works beautifully though, so my build should be fine

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> pjablonski: how long have you been waiting? :)

[01:40] <AlexDaniel> pjablonski: I know it's a weird question, but this got me a few times

[01:41] <AlexDaniel> pjablonski: it takes some time for some stuff to precompile I think, so the first run on my slow pc actually took enough time for me to ^C it

[01:42] <pjablonski> That's... strange, I suppose.  You're right, of course, leaving it up for a solid 3 minutes caused it to work

[01:42] <pjablonski> I mean, other than it whining about ReadLine, but that's par for the course

[01:42] <AlexDaniel> but next time you do it it should be fast

[01:44] <pjablonski> Every time I update things with rakudobrew, something gets squirrely :).  At least it works!

[01:45] *** bjz left
[01:46] <timotimo> it can hang because of a repository being locked while it's trying to load a file

[01:46] <timotimo> that especially happens when you "panda look"

[01:47] <samcv> ok so somebody tell me if this seems okay https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/477

[01:47] <samcv> as in does it sound sane the return values

[01:48] <psch> samcv: you probably want to .tell that to jnthn 

[01:48] <samcv> yeah

[01:48] <samcv> curious what people think though

[01:48] <samcv> i want to make sure I think of everything before i like fully settle on the return valuse

[01:48] * psch thinks "gee i wish i knew unicode enough to have a meaningful opinion about collation"

[01:48] <samcv> heh

[01:49] <samcv> psch, in Latin, primary is alphabetic, secondary is diacritic, and tetriary is case

[01:49] <samcv> it is different in other scripts though

[01:49] <psch> samcv: right, that's too disjunct for me to apply immediately, actually

[01:51] <samcv> i'm trying to cover everything i can initially. like codifying iso standardsn for country ISO numbers and language identifiers when we implement that down the road

[01:51] <samcv> so as to be unchanging with time (the country codes and the language 3/2 letter identifiers for ISO)

[01:51] <samcv> specified we will use the ISO country number code, not the name, since countries can get renamed

[01:52] <samcv> but their number won't change, so that is more dependable to not get changed

[01:52] <samcv> exceptions being if the country splits in two, usually one gets a new number and the other keeps the old

[01:52] *** Ven joined
[01:52] <samcv> so we should be able to have casless or cased sorting as well as being able to ignore diacritics

[01:53] <samcv> which is kind of nice

[01:53] *** petrutrimbitas left
[01:53] *** wamba left
[01:53] <samcv> i still need to think about how to request to ignore the codeponts and only sort by collation weights

[01:54] <samcv> which may be wanted in some cases, and will return 0 for cases which the weights are equal

[01:54] <psch> samcv: sorry for not being actively helpful.  all i can say is "jnthn probably has ideas about this" :/

[01:55] <samcv> .tell jnthn new PR https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/pull/477 want your input on the return values and if they seem sane

[01:55] <yoleaux> samcv: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[01:56] <samcv> hmm now that that's done, need to try and get the (almost last) unicode 9.0 grapheme break thing we don't support, the Extend property added in 9.0

[01:56] <samcv> which is different from all the rest because the combining characer comes BEFORE the base, which never happened in unicode before

[02:35] <psch> webstrand: is there a rakudo-level trace?  and what's the code you're running to get the error?

[02:36] <webstrand> How do I obtain a rakudo trace?

[02:37] <webstrand> https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/master/t/call_back.t is the test

[02:37] <webstrand> specifically, it fails when python tries to call obj.ok(1) on line 14

[02:37] <samcv> holy shit guys

[02:37] <samcv> I did it

[04:00] <samcv> err that's the name of the character 'invisible letter'. you can put combining marks on it, even though it is invisible

[04:02] <geekosaur> makes sense, actually. someone was failing to parse an irc log in JSON format because it contained a string starting with combiners and parsed the combiners as going on the quote

[05:46] <samcv> there has got to be a moarvm function to print out to terminal. but i do not know it, so i just used panic to kill it to know which unicode code path it was taking. took a while to nail down the layers there

[05:47] <samcv> should probably be reworked to make more extensive use of grapheme break property at a higher level than the longest code path

[05:51] *** Ven joined
[05:54] <samcv> i wonder the best way to benchmark it though

[05:54] <samcv> need some generator of lots of random things

[05:54] <samcv> err i guess i could use the unicode spec test, but make it be actual text reading from a file or something, and copy it a ton of times

[08:09] <samcv> that makes no sense

[08:14] <samcv> apparently  ISO 8601:2004 has a year zero. though i guess that's fun for them

[08:14] <samcv> just changing the yeasr by one year

[08:15] <hobbs> makes life easier in many ways

[08:15] <samcv> for who? people dealing with dates in the past?

[08:15] *** Ven joined
[08:15] <samcv> idk i think it should display as 1 BC. it can be stored as 0 though if they like that

[08:15] <samcv> but 0 is not a year, does not exist, never existed

[08:15] <samcv> and it's been true for thousands of years.

[08:16] <hobbs> ain't nowhere in the ISO8601 grammar to put a "BC" :)

[08:16] *** labster joined
[08:17] <samcv> then have it negative?

[08:17] <samcv> -1

[08:17] <samcv> i guess they just uh idk

[08:17] <samcv> whatever year 0 is stupid there should be one

[08:17] <hobbs> then arithmetic would be broken :)

[08:17] <samcv> but there isn't so everybody should fall in line dammit

[08:18] <hobbs> anyway, in lieu of a video from today, here's one from 18 months ago: https://vimeo.com/133728097

[08:18] <samcv> The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1 BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. 

[08:18] <samcv> ok can we at least use -0?

[08:18] <samcv> since other BC's are negative

[08:19] <samcv> it at least makes it clear it's not The Year Zero, but it's part of the BC section of the timeline

[10:06] <gfldex> samcv: I don't want to use them in a module because of their experimental nature. Esp. for something that may be a dependency for quite a few modules.

[10:06] <samcv> exactly

[10:07] <samcv> gfldex, also why are routines or operators not good for this use case? when are macros better?

[10:08] <gfldex> the idea is to write stuff like `say N(75kg)` resulting in `735.49875N`

[10:08] <gfldex> i would like to have macros so I don't type my fingers bleedy

[10:08] <gfldex> vim is of great help tho

[10:10] <geekosaur> the state of macros is "in nom, known to be very limited and rather buggy, needs significant redesign; talk to masak"

[10:10] *** Ven left
[10:13] <samcv> say N(75, :kg ); sub N ( $num, :$kg?, :$m? ) { … }

[10:13] <samcv> why can't do that?

[10:13] <samcv> more typing I know

[10:14] <geekosaur> (or go take a look at https://github.com/masak/007 which iirc is masak's macro playground trying to come up with a more workable macro scheme)

[10:16] *** labster left
[10:16] <gfldex> with `75kg` I get a Numerical with a role mixed in

[10:16] <gfldex> so I can do `multi sub N(SI-kilogram $kg){ $kg * g }` to provide typesafety

[10:17] <gfldex> next step would be to overload infix:<*> to complain if stuff is multiplied that shouldn't

[10:17] <samcv> nice

[10:17] <samcv> why can't you just add postfix kg

[10:18] <gfldex> I also overload .gist already so you get nice short numbers

[10:18] <gfldex> i did add postfix kg

[10:18] <geekosaur> I think you end up writing it as 75\kg or some such

[10:19] <gfldex> but I have a long list of units prefixes so for each base unit I have 18 postfixes to define

[13:09] <geekosaur> er?

[13:11] <froggs> Pauls is plural

[13:30] <geekosaur> object code's a different beast, yes. can be highly compressible, because you have lots of boilerplate code generated for various language constructs, function prologs/epilogs, etc.

[13:32] * RabidGravy wonders whether he is slipped back in time forty years

[13:33] <iH2O> perl6 object code should compress tremendously given its tremendously underoptimized

[13:33] <geekosaur> more than that :)

[13:33] <iH2O> :)

[13:34] <iH2O> i mean perl6 intermediary code

[13:34] <geekosaur> actually that was the "40 years" comment I was responding to

[13:35] <geekosaur> as to intermediate code, every time I look at nqp I want to write a macro processor to generate most of it for me :p

[13:39] <iH2O> i use English as a 2nd language but i never confuse "its" and "it's". i'm puzzled no end every time i see a well educated native English speaker confuse them

[13:39] <iH2O> which happens all the time

[13:40] <geekosaur> not sure how much of it is confusing them and how much is sloppiness from e.g. texting where why would you hunt down the apostrophe?

[13:41] <RabidGravy> this is largely to do with how people learn their native language

[13:41] *** pierre_ joined
[13:41] <RabidGravy> I always make an effort to use the correct apostrophes in text messages

[13:49] <masak> I'm gonna OT you some more by telling you that I'm still enjoying fleshing out https://gist.github.com/masak/8e082999e06bfb4d03b8d12899bbcde5

[13:49] <masak> I'm now up to (or down to) having defined subtraction. yay!

[13:50] <masak> iH2O: I find I only make it's/its type mistakes when I'm really tired and my brain basically only has the energy to type "by sound" instead of by the underlying words' spelling.

[13:51] <masak> strangely, it only happens to me with it's/its, not with there/their/they're, as far as I can remember

[13:51] <geekosaur> RabidGravy, I do wonder how much https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151208094229.htm generalizes

[13:51] <masak> (oh! the gist above is worth reading solely for the awful Peano pun near the end!)

[13:51] * geekosaur more likely to thinko the latter when tired

[13:52] <geekosaur> and yes, going by sound does seem to be part of it, but if I mess up with it's/its I'm more likely to have fat-fingered the enter key instead of '

[13:53] <toolforger> Heh. Curry is spicy, even in programming :-)

[13:54] <masak> :)

[13:55] <toolforger> +1 for the Kronecker quote, too

[13:55] <masak> I've always liked that one

[13:55] <masak> but lately I've come to feel that only 0 and 1 are in fact real

[13:55] <masak> everything else is, like, so made up

[13:55] <toolforger> Also, "God made time, but calendars are the work of the Devil"

[13:55] <RabidGravy> nothing is real

[13:55] <masak> RabidGravy: cf. 0-tuples in the gist :P

[13:56] <toolforger> My first course in math defined integers like this: zero is the empty set, the successor to x is the set containing x

[13:56] <toolforger> so, 0 is represented as {}, 1 as {{}}, 2 as {{{}}}, etc

[13:56] <toolforger> it all worked... so not even 0 and 1 are real, just the empty set, and sets containing a single element

[13:56] <toolforger> :-D

[13:57] <geekosaur> ...someone teaches arithmetic from ZFC?!

[13:57] <geekosaur> (well, a variant)

[13:57] *** dugword left
[13:57] <masak> toolforger: that's not the standard ZFC definition, but yeah, I've seen that one too

[13:57] <toolforger> It was more an introductory course to induction, if you will forgive me the pun

[13:58] <toolforger> They never told us what that particular model was called

[13:58] <masak> toolforger: I think what one needs to not lose sight of is that while it's definitely *possible* to define everything with sets, it's definitely not the *only* way, let alone the only *right* way :)

[13:58] <toolforger> if you say "ZFC variant", I'll happily agree with whatever you say

[13:58] <masak> toolforger: think it's "von Neumann numbers" or something. let me check.

[13:58] <toolforger> But yeah, it's just models

[13:59] <toolforger> the thing per se is just the axioms, but these don't represent well

[14:00] <toolforger> not in the human mind, and not in computers

[14:00] <masak> I've become very partial to CT's way of defining foundations of algebra lately

[14:00] <toolforger> so we use one of many models, and hope that the model doesn't mislead us into overly specific conclusions

[14:00] <toolforger> CT?

[14:00] *** aries_liuxueyang left
[14:00] <geekosaur> or other mistakes (ohai Gödel!)

[14:00] <geekosaur> category theory, I think

[14:01] * toolforger takes a cautious step back

[14:01] <masak> yes, category theory

[14:01] <masak> not as bad as it sounds :)

[14:01] * toolforger runs

[14:01] <geekosaur> it's just a generalization of sets, what's the problem? :p

[14:01] <masak> toolforger: I was wrong. von Neumann ordinals are those that I'm used to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#Von_Neumann_definition_of_ordinals

[14:01] <toolforger> :-)

[14:01] <masak> geekosaur: yeah, but that's selling categories a bit short, IMHO

[14:02] <toolforger> It's just that I never took a course in CT, and the reading material that I saw was either too handwavy to be useful or assumed too much background and was too heavy

[14:02] <masak> toolforger: category theory has a bad name, I guess, because it's very abstract and condensed. it takes a bit of patience to learn enough context around it in order to appreciate CT itself

[14:03] <masak> toolforger: I found it useful to start by beefing up on algebraic topology, out of which CT was largely born

[14:03] <toolforger> Yeah, that would be part of the "too much background"

[14:03] <masak> I've never taken a course in it either :)

[14:03] <toolforger> I know my way around formal logic

[14:03] <masak> anyway, the tl;dr is that CT has shown me that the natural numbers really *are* quite fundamental

[14:04] <toolforger> Up to and including basics of fixed-point theory

[14:04] <toolforger> masak, I can imagine

[14:04] <masak> and integers too

[14:05] <masak> the ring of the integers is the "initial object" in the category of rings. that means, hand-wavily, that it relates to all other rings in a unique way.

[14:05] <toolforger> Another observation just how fundamental naturals are: They are the smallest model where Diagonalization works, so they are the smallest domain where incompleteness, indecidability and all that stuff happen

[14:05] <toolforger> They are also the smallest model that can carry algorithms

[14:05] <masak> aye

[14:05] <masak> that's why they are so freaky

[14:06] <toolforger> so undecidability is fundamental to algorithms, which is sort of freaky, too

[14:06] <masak> somewhere out there there's a huge natural number that encodes your entire life in bits

[14:06] <masak> everything that ever happened or will happen to you

[14:06] <toolforger> yeah, but the number is probably just as large as the binary log itself

[14:07] <masak> it's cool, I won't ask you to write it down or read it aloud

[14:07] <masak> just to contemplate it

[14:07] <toolforger> I.e. the famous "Shakespeare works typed by monkeys" thing - I assume that on the average, the number needed to specify WHICH of those monkey works is the Shakespearian works is just as large as the works itself

[14:07] <toolforger> I can't prove it though

[14:08] <toolforger> but I suspect it could be proven using information theory

[14:08] <masak> intuitively it feels like it could be a fair bit smaller

[14:08] <masak> but yeah, you'd have a "librarian's problem" of filing and categorizing all the huge reams of infinite garbage coming from the monkeys

[14:08] <toolforger> Add another letter to the works multiplies the possibilities by alphabet size

[14:08] <toolforger> so you need another alphabet letter to file the works

[14:09] <masak> kind of reminds me of the discussions around Maxwell's Demon, actually

[14:09] *** aries_liuxueyang joined
[14:09] <masak> ooh! someone write up some Infinite Monkeys/Maxwell's Demon crossover fanfic! :D

[14:10] <toolforger> the protagonist told it to build a wall of tax legislation, which it gleefully did

[14:10] * geekosaur briefly considers checking ao3, decides that having been up all night due to sinuses he is officially too tired

[14:11] <masak> moritz: I'm going to need to explain the Y combinator in order to define division. kind of looking forward to it, in a weird way.

[14:12] <toolforger> Don't you need Y for subtraction already?

[14:12] <masak> nope, just the natural iteration of numbers

[14:12] <geekosaur> only for the zero case :p

[14:12] <masak> geekosaur: that's not Y, that's just diverge :)

[14:13] <masak> Y is like a harnessed version of diverge

[14:13] <toolforger> Well, actually the predecessor function

[14:13] <masak> which is probably a neat way to start explaining it

[14:13] *** aries_liuxueyang left
[14:13] <masak> toolforger: right. see the bottom of the gist.

[14:13] <masak> toolforger: it dismays me a little how many resources online define `pred 0` as `0`

[14:14] <toolforger> I stopped reading at the paragraph, that's the point where my brain starts turning into a Klein bottle :-)

[14:14] <toolforger> But sure, pred 0 is undefined, not 0

[14:14] <masak> right

[14:14] <masak> which is why we diverge if someone asks for it

[14:14] <toolforger> Plus pred 0 is the perfect point to explain partial functions, and what problems they cause

[14:14] <masak> hm

[14:14] <toolforger> but can you even define pred in Lambda calculus if you don't have Y?

[14:14] *** hartenfels joined
[14:15] <masak> I believe I just did

[14:15] <masak> all you need is to iterate up to n-1

[14:15] <masak> that can be done using the iteration in Church numerals

[14:15] <masak> of course, those are themselves defined inductively

[14:15] <masak> with a... scheme

[14:16] <toolforger> Ah right, you set up a function that returns the list and wrap it in a selector function that returns the predecessor

[14:16] <masak> something like that, yes

[14:16] <toolforger> Yeah

[14:16] <toolforger> I'm pretty sure it's not what you're actually doing, but it's the overall structure

[14:17] *** aries_liuxueyang joined
[14:17] <masak> I iterate over the (conceptual) sequence (diverge, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2)...

[14:17] <toolforger> But... it's recursive

[14:17] <masak> I maintain it's not -- at least not the way I see it

[14:17] <toolforger> Wait... no, it isn't

[14:17] <toolforger> Strange

[14:18] <masak> all you do is have arbitrarily high Church numerals

[14:18] <toolforger> it *should* be recursive if it unwraps to a for loop

[14:18] <masak> no, it's just that the Church numeral for N has N application in it

[14:18] <masak> think of it as "brute-force iteration" or something

[14:20] <toolforger> Maybe the lambda expression for pred is inaccurate

[14:20] <toolforger> I cannot check it, not confidently enough to be sure anyway

[14:23] * geekosaur spots the point in the gist where the original notation for function application gets rediscovered >.>

[14:24] <toolforger> Oooo-kay, I think I just grokked Church numerals

[14:24] <masak> toolforger: :)

[14:24] <masak> geekosaur: could you enlighten me, please? I'm not sure what you're referring to.

[14:24] <toolforger> i.e. why it's useful to define numbers in this way

[14:25] <geekosaur> exponentiation

[14:25] <masak> geekosaur: I can see that in many places in mathematics, there is a *notational* parallel being drawn between exponentiation and function application

[14:25] <masak> geekosaur: it even makes some sense on a semantic level

[14:26] <masak> geekosaur: but I don't feel I have the full picture there. specifically, arithmetical exponentiation still seems to me to be completely unrelated to function application.

[14:26] <masak> toolforger: a Church numeral for N is basically just N repeated applications, frozen into a lambda

[14:26] <toolforger> yes

[14:26] <toolforger> I knew that

[14:27] <geekosaur> well, the context I'm talking about is lambda calculus. and originally they used the notation for arithmetic exponentiation to represent application, because of the equivalence at the lambda calc level

[14:27] <dalek> doc: 3d5e064 | (Tom Browder)++ | doc/Language/syntax.pod6:

[14:27] <dalek> doc: add missing word

[14:27] <synopsebot6> Link: http://doc.perl6.org/language/syntax

[14:29] <toolforger> I just have been thinking that Church numerals are just the function-land equivalent of nested sets - pretty but useless

[14:29] <masak> geekosaur: who are "they"? Alonzo Church?

[14:29] <masak> toolforger: then what was it you just realized?

[14:29] <toolforger> Now I see that defining N as "N applications of some functions", there's actually real power

[14:30] <masak> aye

[14:30] *** pierre_ left
[14:30] <toolforger> you don't need an external definition/axiom to DO something with a number, it is already a function that does something for you

[14:30] * toolforger is going to bed smarter today than he stood up

[14:31] <masak> right; I love the "ostensive" feel of Church encoding

[14:31] * toolforger nods

[14:32] <masak> a boolean is a two-way chooser; a number is a function iterator

[14:32] * toolforger is going back to hacking NQP, that's easier

[14:32] *** cdg joined
[14:32] <toolforger> :-D

[14:32] <masak> ooh! and *that's* how you define the Y combinator!

[14:33] <masak> the Y combinator is simply an *infinite* function iterator :)

[14:33] <toolforger> Note that the Y combinator is easy to define in Lambda Calculus, but cannot be defined in any Typed Lambda Calculus

[14:33] <toolforger> you cannot assign consistent types to parameter and result types

[14:34] <masak> right

[14:34] <toolforger> I'm feeling pretty uneasy with that

[14:34] <masak> nah; you just need something stronger than simply typed lambda calculus for it

[14:34] <masak> I think something like "forall" is enough

[14:35] *** cdg left
[14:35] <toolforger> Dunno; I didn't follow the reasoning, I just noted the result as presented

[14:35] <masak> it's not so surprising that something with the power to diverge in its innards is hard to type with the simplest possible type system :P

[14:35] <geekosaur> masak, yes it was Church and in fact it followed from his definition of ordinals

[14:35] <geekosaur> since they are themselves exponentiations, in a sense

[14:35] <masak> geekosaur: very interesting. thank you.

[14:37] <toolforger> I have a question about "make test" in nqp

[14:38] <toolforger> does it run the tests with all backends, or just with the default backend?

[14:38] <toolforger> I need to validate that all backends built correctly

[14:38] <psch> you should have backend-specific test targets

[14:38] <psch> i.e. j-test, m-test

[14:38] <toolforger> because I'm mucking around with the makefile(s)

[14:39] <toolforger> psch, I see, running these as well

[14:39] <toolforger> thx

[14:39] <psch> those do run the normal test battery, i.e. for a moar-only nqp build m-test and test are equivalent

[14:39] <psch> at least as far as i am aware

[14:40] <toolforger> I have a backends=all build here

[14:40] <toolforger> not sure which of the three backends are being run with just 'make test'

[14:41] <toolforger> oh, and there's also qregex-test

[14:41] <psch> well, the test target runs the primary backend

[14:41] <psch> the easiest way to check which one that is is checking what ./nqp calls i guess

[14:42] <toolforger> it's doing install/bin/moar nqp.moarvm

[14:42] *** kurahaupo__ joined
[14:42] *** kurahaupo__ left
[14:43] <toolforger> so I guess I also need make 'j-test' and 'make js-test', is that right?

[14:44] <psch> i'd say so

[14:44] <psch> i think those also run qregex tests..?

[14:44] <toolforger> Um... I am getting a java.lang.RuntimeException

[14:45] <toolforger> ah right, 'make test'  reports that it is doing "prove -r --exec "./nqp-m" t/nqp t/hll t/qregex t/p5regex t/qast t/moar t/serialization t/nativecall"

[14:45] <toolforger> then nqp-j

[14:45] <toolforger> so make test is indeed exercising all available backends, which is sweet

[14:46] <psch> oh, neat.  i wasn't aware of that

[14:46] <toolforger> Test failures for "make j-test":

[14:46] <toolforger> t/serialization/01-basic.t ............. 1/1502 java.lang.RuntimeException: No such attribute '$!written' for this object

[15:33] *** cibs joined
[15:33] <geekosaur> but, really, the ideal way to handle that is to have a dedicated character to act as a holder, and require everything to use it instead of having to special case combining character handling for quotes

[15:36] <geekosaur> well, ideally it goes with an indicator of whether a character takes combining characters (this may already exist) and writing that would be ill-formed unicode

[16:50] <dugword> $foo is an optional named argument, but I get a warning about trying to convert it to an int because of the signature. Should it, or is there an idomatic way to write this? Or do I need to check if it is defined and cast it in the sub definition.

[19:31] <dugword> What is it?

[19:33] <notviki> You made :$localhost required, but it wasn't before, so in that test .new() fails to find the candidate to call and fails, and because we let that start block ignore exceptions it doesn't throw and tries to listen to a sock that failed to get created

[19:34] <notviki> well

[19:34] <masak> all I heard was "...ignore exceptions..." o.O

[19:35] <notviki> dugword: well, that's one issue. Still fails.

[19:35] * notviki looks harder

[19:43] *** thundergnat left
[19:44] <notviki> OK. Now it gets stuck :P

[19:44] * notviki looks harder

[19:44] <dugword> :$localhost previously worked if it wasn't defined and it would listen on a random port, just like if you pass port 0. Do we need to preserve that behavior? And the :D on :$localhost?

[19:44] <dugword> (Or I think that is what it was doing)

[19:46] <RabidGravy> For a listener you can't require localhost

[19:47] *** shayan_ left
[19:48] <dugword> Why is that?

[19:48] *** Tonik joined
[19:50] <RabidGravy> because a listener may want to listen on all interfaces on all families

[19:51] <RabidGravy> so not specifying right now gives you both v6 and v4 if available

[19:53] <RabidGravy> if you specify 0.0.0.0 you only get v4

[19:54] <RabidGravy> unless there's something in this that "fixes" that

[19:54] <dugword> I see

[19:54] <notviki> We do specify that: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/IO/Socket/INET.pm#L75

[20:01] <RabidGravy> oh that one isn't surprising

[20:01] *** brrt joined
[20:02] <notviki> dugword: so one issue is Str:D :$localhost! needs to be Str :$localhost

[20:03] <notviki> dugword: and the other issue is then you pass undefined args to split-host-port/v4-split and it throws because it can't resolve, for example, split on a :U stringf

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> hey, um… I have a qustion

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> m: dd ‘aaa bbb ccc’.split(‘ ’, 2)

[20:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b5ea: OUTPUT«("aaa", "bbb ccc").Seq␤»

[20:03] <AlexDaniel> so it just takes the first element and puts the rest as a second one, right?

[20:03] <notviki> dugword: I don't know why the test passes for you, are you sure you correctly built your perl6?

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> so, if this is like this:

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> m: dd ‘aaa bbb ccc’.split(‘’)

[20:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b5ea: OUTPUT«("", "a", "a", "a", " ", "b", "b", "b", " ", "c", "c", "c", "")␤»

[20:04] <RabidGravy> AlexDaniel, yes that is my understanding

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> and this is like this:

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> m: dd ‘aaa bbb ccc’.split(‘’, 2)

[20:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b5ea: OUTPUT«("", "aaa bbb ccc").Seq␤»

[20:04] <masak> from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Y_combinator#Perl_6 -- "Note that Perl 6 doesn't actually need a Y combinator because you can name anonymous functions from the inside" -- with all due respect, but that's kind of missing the point about the Y combinator ;)

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> then why is this like this?

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> m: dd ‘aaa bbb ccc’.split(‘’, 1)

[20:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b5ea: OUTPUT«("aaa bbb ccc",)␤»

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> oh, because it gets merged

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> ok, no question, thanks

[20:06] <notviki> What do you mean merged?

[20:06] <AlexDaniel> nevermind, it was a bug in my head

[20:06] <notviki> So why is it the original string and not ""?

[20:07] <dugword> Thanks Not viki, I'll take a look at my build. Very likely I am not doing something right... 

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> notviki: huh?

[20:08] <notviki> dugword: here's my alias for building it: build-rakudo is aliased to `perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar; make; make test; make install'

[20:08] *** brrt2 joined
[20:09] <notviki> .... 

[20:09] <dugword> would v4-split not have been throwing before? I don't think I changed that function

[20:09] <notviki> dugword: you didn't but you're passing undefined arguments and old code doesn't

[20:09] <notviki> AlexDaniel: why is the first item in the result changes when you set a different limit

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> notviki: because when you ask for 1 item only it will attempt to shove in the whole string into it

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> notviki: so the empty string kind of disappears

[20:11] <notviki> ok

[20:15] <huggable> AlexDaniel, nothing found

[20:15] <psch> claytonrowe: you are in the right place.  https://docs.perl6.org is a start, and https://rt.perl.org has the perl6 bug tracker queue

[20:15] <moritz> claytonrowe: welcome to #perl6. What aspects are you interested in?

[20:19] <psch> claytonrowe: well, you *can* just hang around here honestly :)

[20:19] <psch> that's usually at least a little conductive to learning the language i find

[21:23] <psch> ...actually that's "and here's why you can't use that other trick that works in similar situation", and not just a detail

[21:23] <kalkin-> ugexe: I see. Thank you for your explanation, but this way it's very cumbersome to maintain multiple versions. 

[21:24] <ugexe> yes, but thats because the p6 ecosystem was not intended to be a permanent solution. things like CPAN will be able to do things like automatically add a source-url (a non-spec) to whatever you upload

[21:25] <kalkin-> This also makes versioning dependencies hard if the dependency provider doesn't take care of it

[21:25] <ugexe> i dont understand how that makes it harder

[21:26] <ugexe> you depends on "Some::Module:ver<foo>" - its up to the recommendation managers (p6 ecosystem, cpan, or a combination) to resolve that into the download urls

[21:26] <kalkin-> ugexe: well say you are using semantic versioning. you depend on v1.* of your library. The author publishes version 2.0, if he doesn't think about making a PR to the ecosystem, you are screwed

[21:27] <psch> m: say v2 ~~ v1.*

[21:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar 29b5ea: OUTPUT«False␤»

[21:27] <psch> kalkin-: you'd still get v1.* from the ecosystem..?

[21:28] <ugexe> well thats how packaging works. `apt-get` doesn't automatically know every 3rd party mirror for instance - the user has to add those things 

[21:28] <psch> ...actually no, i'm wrong, please disregard

[21:28] <kalkin-> ohh so basically i need my own recomendation manager which is smart enough given some a git url as source-url to find in some custom way (i.e. through tags) all the existing versions?

[21:28] <moritz> claytonrowe: do you think you have a way forward now, re learning / contributing to Perl 6?

[21:28] <psch> afaiu the META6.json just has to be updated, which isn't in the ecosystem

[21:29] <ugexe> no. first you need to quit thinking of the perl6 ecosystem as a solution instead of a temporary thing that is holding us up for now

[21:29] <kalkin-> k

[21:29] <ugexe> tbrowder examples show how it *can* work, but as you see its not ideal

[21:30] <mst> the current ecosystem stuff is very much a "simplest thing that can possibly work" bootstrap hack

[21:30] <ugexe> when you upload a module to CPAN it can add its own URL. cpan doesnt need to know how to clone anything from git because you're supposed to upload the actual distribution

[21:30] <kalkin-> So what shall be done? What is the desired state?

[21:30] <mst> (and I do not mean that as a criticism, if we'd tried to design something proper straight off, it wouldn't've worked anyway)

[21:30] <kalkin-> I get the feeling that I only see a part of the problem

[21:31] <ugexe> you're seeing a problem with something that we're going to throw away eventually because precisely because it has problems

[21:32] <geekosaur> I think the point is that nobody can see more than a part of the problem; the ecosystem needs to evolve into a usable shape, it is evolving, nobody yet knows where it will end up because that will be shaped by what is actually needed

[21:33] *** Wanderer68 joined
[21:33] <geekosaur> and it's not the kind of problem where you can guess the end result beforehand, except in very broad/vague terms

[21:33] <ugexe> fwiw I can see the entire problem as well as the solution

[21:35] <moritz> ugexe: then you should write up your envisioned solution somewhere, if you haven't done so already

[21:35] *** Wanderer68 left
[21:36] <ugexe> we've had these discussions in #perl6-toolchain

[21:36] <moritz> and is there a consensus?

[21:38] <ugexe> the only thing i'm aware of that is up in the air is how to handle the difference between the perl6 concept of `auth` and CPAN's author

[21:38] <psch> wouldn't CPAN be one :auth in our world?

[21:39] <ugexe> no

[21:39] <ugexe> :auth doesn't imply anything, although a reccomendation manager could choose to only allow auth's it could verify

[21:39] <psch> okay.  i always understood it as "authority", in a "takes responsibility to provide it"

[21:39] <ugexe> but if i upload Foo::Bar:auth<github:ugexe> to cpan it is still Foo::Bar:auth<github:ugexe>

[21:40] <psch> ahh, so it's more like "where's the authorative version"

[21:40] <psch> ...in a way

[21:40] <ugexe> authority really means the 'original'

[21:40] <ugexe> yeah its just another name-part for uniqueness

[21:42] <ugexe> TimToady has commented that :auth<email@address.com> is probably the best form of auth because it takes some of the confusion around treating it as a source of something away

[21:45] <kalkin-> so how do i proceed now if I want this version recommendation feature and I don't want to hack zef and maintain a my own fork of it?

[21:46] <kalkin-> Also you all are talking about ecosystem is just provisory, it should be more like CPAN, for me both look like "just" a webfrontend, like pypy or cargo. What am I missing?

[21:46] *** pierre__ joined
[21:48] <ugexe> tbrowders example does not use multiple forks

[21:48] <RabidGravy> CPAN is a network of mirrors, indexing and so forth, the web front end is a tiny part

[21:49] *** hartenfels left
[21:49] *** pierre_ left
[21:50] <kalkin-> so the plan is to make perl6 in some way compatible with the original CPAN?

[21:50] <ugexe> kalkin-: https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-toolchain/2016-10-08#i_13363041 here is where i explained how to do multiple versions in the ecosystem

[21:50] *** pyrimidine left
[21:50] *** pyrimidine joined
[21:51] <kalkin-> ugexe thanks

[21:51] <pmurias> is how the Foo is chosen in 'use Foo' figured out?

[21:52] <pmurias> what I mean is how is a short name without an auth mapped to one with an auth

[21:52] <ugexe> technically thats up to the CompUnit::Repository

[21:53] <RabidGravy> selecting for auth and ver works fine though

[21:53] <ugexe> a short name without an auth simply searches without looking at the auth

[21:55] <pmurias> so if there are two modules what will happen?

[21:55] <RabidGravy> it may well load the wrong one

[21:55] *** labster joined
[21:56] *** zakharyas left
[21:57] <RabidGravy> which is why e.g. HTTP::Server::Async and HTTP::UserAgent load HTTP::Request with an explicot auth

[21:57] <ugexe> https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6-toolchain/2016-12-12#i_13727142 Here is a recent discussion where i brought up concerns with :auth (which I brought up due to the just mentioned HTTP::UserAgent bit)

[21:59] *** bjz joined
[21:59] <RabidGravy> but then you get into a name registry game

[22:00] <kalkin-> why don't we just use pgp keys in auth? (SCNR)

[22:00] <ugexe> i dont see how. you still have auth, i just propose the way it resolves what to use be ordered differently

[22:01] <ugexe> because without pgp installed its just some string like the current auth

[22:01] <RabidGravy> but the argument seems to be from nine that using auth to solve that is a bad thing

[22:01] <ugexe> RabidGravy: click 'next day'

[22:01] <ugexe> i think he agrees with that now

[22:02] <kalkin-> ugexe: i would say it's a windows problem, but I suspect #perl6 wouldn't agree with me :)

[22:03] <RabidGravy> I'm not going to forever backlog toolchain, it needs summaries

[22:18] <masak> pretty happy with how it turned out.

[22:21] *** Ven left
[22:22] <toolforger> reading up

[22:22] <toolforger> turns out that understanding lambda calculus requires that you grok higher-order functions

[22:23] *** TEttinger joined
[22:23] <masak> when all you have is a s/hammer/function/... :P

[22:25] <toolforger> lol

[22:25] <toolforger> btw did you grok the fixed-point idea behind the Y combinator?

[22:25] <geekosaur> pretty much :)

[22:26] <masak> toolforger: yes; was tempted to mention it

[22:26] <masak> might still weave it in somewhere

[22:26] <toolforger> I think it's worth expounding in a separate gist

[22:26] <toolforger> TMI after all

[22:26] <masak> the fixed-point idea is what I'm hinting at with my "limit" reasoning and Church aleph-null

[22:27] <masak> oh, this gist is already far too much -- no sense in holding back now :P

[22:27] <toolforger> Ah, you didn't grok fixed points

[22:27] <toolforger> ;-P

[22:27] <masak> I'll see what I can do. you're right that fixpoints are worth mentioning

[22:27] <toolforger> taking the fixed point of a function is a combinator

[22:27] <masak> ...makes sense

[22:28] <masak> I tend to think of it as a functor :P

[22:28] <toolforger> I think functor = combinator

[22:28] <geekosaur> but "functor" is rather overloaded when it comes to computer languages

[22:28] <toolforger> both take functions and return functions

[22:28] <geekosaur> SML, Haskell, and C++ all have "functors" --- each defined differently

[22:28] <toolforger> well, you can't evade overloaded terminology in CS :-D

[22:28] <masak> ah, no. CT's functor is what I meant.

[22:29] <masak> which maps between categories.

[22:29] <geekosaur> yeh, I;m just saying there is reason to avoid dragging the term in at all

[22:29] <toolforger> anyway - the definition of a fixed point is nonconstructive

[22:29] <toolforger> i.e. the definition does not do recursion

[22:29] <geekosaur> (and of those three, only Haskell's comes close to the CT definition, and it's still not the same --- it's a CT *endofunctor*

[22:29] <masak> toolforger: will look into that some more -- thanks for the tip

[22:29] <toolforger> that's how you define recursion without having to trace actual execution semantics

[22:29] <toolforger> which is pretty awesome

[22:29] <geekosaur> specifically on the category Hask)

[22:29] <masak> geekosaur: ah, yes; endofunctor is what I meant to say :)

[22:30] <toolforger> e.g. try to define equality

[22:30] *** shayan_ joined
[22:30] <pmurias> masak: is the initial claim that all computations can be represented by the applications and abstractions audacious?

[22:31] <geekosaur> if you're starting from zero, it is

[22:31] <toolforger> it's recursive, so you need a fixed point

[22:31] *** curt_ joined
[22:32] <toolforger> so you can have reference equality, value equality, or abstract away representation when doing equality, and it's still all consistent unless you start mixing up definitions

[22:33] <geekosaur> ...but in a sense it's a different way of looking at the core of number theory, and if you're aware of Turing equivalence then you can approach it from that angle as well

[22:33] <toolforger> ?

[22:33] <geekosaur> response to pmurias

[22:34] <toolforger> ah ok

[22:34] <geekosaur> sorry

[22:34] <toolforger> np

[22:34] *** pyrimidine left
[22:34] <toolforger> I agree that the initial claim is audacious, but it's also justified so it isn't audacious after all

[22:35] *** pyrimidine joined
[22:35] <geekosaur> a fair chunk of the middle of _Gödel, Escher, Bach_ is dedicated to proving that claim, actually (take another look at TNT)

[22:36] <toolforger> GEB was both an eye-opener and disappointing to me

[22:36] *** petrutrimbitas left
[22:36] <masak> pmurias: I think so.

[22:37] <toolforger> the Gödel part is sound, but the idea that intuition is somehow linked to self-referentiality is pretty hilarious

[22:37] <masak> pmurias: it's easier for me to swallow that a Turing machine can emulate all computations than that the symbol games of lambda calculus can.

[22:37] <masak> 'night, #perl6

[22:37] <toolforger> seeya

[22:37] <geekosaur> toolforger, the funny part about GEB is that Hofstadter was using math in an argumnt in modern philosophy. which is ... kinda screwy from the start

[22:38] * toolforger would like modern philosophers to have a better understanding of math and science

[22:38] <geekosaur> philosophy and math parted ways centuries ago, and modern philosophy in particular hasn't looked back

[22:38] <toolforger> it should

[22:39] <toolforger> not because it's math, but because it's a yardstick that can evaluate the validity of some arguments

[22:40] <toolforger> so if a philosopher does not know math, he won't know when he's talking nonsense that any mathematician will be able to refute

[22:42] <toolforger> Physics would usually be more relevant, as would be statistics, psychology, sociology

[22:42] *** shayan_ left
[22:43] <geekosaur> sadly, I have the impression that modern philosophy is proud of not polluting its purity with such trivialities

[22:44] <toolforger> That's unwise, so that kind of philosophy isn't philosophical at all

[22:44] <toolforger> ("philosophia" = "love of wisdom", I hear)

[22:44] <geekosaur> (which is why I find GEB so odd)

[22:45] <toolforger> off to bed - seeya!

[22:46] *** toolforger left
[22:47] *** newbie1 joined
[22:50] <geekosaur> probably for the best... first argument there would be with the ancient Greeks, for whom natural philosophy (which begat science and math) was only one of many options
