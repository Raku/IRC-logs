[02:52] <ZzZombo> timotimo, it doesn't work:

[02:53] <timotimo> you're returning a single string from alternative-names

[02:53] <ZzZombo> ah shit

[02:53] <timotimo> alternative-names is an optional method for this role, though, as it has an implementation

[02:53] <timotimo> the error could definitely be improved there

[02:54] <timotimo> by putting a typecheck in place

[02:58] *** mcmillhj joined
[03:00] <ZzZombo> I don't see how can my encoder access the options passed to `encoder` call of my encoding.

[03:01] <timotimo> you take that parameter in your encoder method and pass it on to the constructor of your encoder

[03:02] <timotimo> for example method encoder(*%opts) { Encoding::UCS2.new(*%opts) }

[16:05] <tadzik> so how about we rewrite rakudobrew into something meant for end-users and rebrand a tool for devs into something else?

[16:19] <timotimo> you mean the one who starts with m and ends in st? :)

[16:36] <ZzZombo> timotimo: help with writing decoder is appreciated, it's the last thing that holds me back.

[16:36] <timotimo> right, the decoder is a bit more complicated because we really want to be able to deal with partial data coming in

[16:37] <timotimo> i thought you only needed an encoder

[16:37] <timotimo> however, you're relatively in luck. you don't have to deal with variable width data pieces at all; everything is 16 bit units all the time, and you don't even have to support surrogates!

[16:38] <ZzZombo> Well, it would complicate having to encode/decode using different encodings.

[16:38] <timotimo> oh, you mean switch in between?

[16:39] <ZzZombo> No, I'm answering your previous line

[16:39] <ZzZombo> <timotimo> i thought you only needed an encoder

[16:39] <timotimo> right, i thought you were only taking data in, never writing data back out into this horrible horrible format :)

[16:40] <ZzZombo> I could use UTF-16 encoding to read files, and write using my custom UCS-2 encoding, but that's a terrible mess then of a code to support.

[16:42] <timotimo> i can't help terribly much, need to rest my wrists for RSI reasons

[16:43] <ZzZombo> I could help if you could tell me if it's possible to write an decoder that would just delegate decoding to the built-in UTF-16 decoder.

[16:43] <ZzZombo> It*

[16:43] <timotimo> oh

[16:43] <timotimo> well, yes of course it is :)

[16:44] <timotimo> something like that

[16:44] <ZzZombo> and here I am, preparing myself to write a dozens of lines for that.

[16:45] <ZzZombo> the asterisk isn't needed in the `decoder` call, is it?

[16:46] <timotimo> it expects options to be passed as individual named parameters, not a single hash

[16:46] <ZzZombo> ah

[17:56] <timotimo> if you turn your BUILD into a TWEAK you won't have to re-write all the default values in the signature

[17:58] <ZzZombo> done.

[18:00] <timotimo> huh. well, that's certainly wrong.

[18:02] <timotimo> for now just pass the encoding object to :enc instead, does that work?

[18:02] <timotimo> actually it doesn't seem to work?

[18:04] <ZzZombo> Malformed UTF-8 at line 1 col 1

[18:04] <ZzZombo>   in sub MAIN at encode.p6 line 101

[18:05] <timotimo> it ignores anything but Str passed to enc, and it doesn't seem to look at the registry at all

[18:06] <ZzZombo> huh

[18:07] <timotimo> i'm afraid you might have to use the decoder API directly here

[18:07] <timotimo> or since you're just slurping put "utf16" instead

[18:09] <ZzZombo> you mean in the meantime? Until it's fixed?

[18:09] <ZzZombo> whenever that will be

[18:09] <timotimo> yeah

[18:10] <timotimo> the next release is like today

[18:10] <timotimo> so a fix likely won't make it in

[18:10] <ZzZombo> last resort, I'll do it, sigh

[18:10] <ZzZombo> so much for this though

[18:11] *** domidumont joined
[18:12] <timotimo> might be enough to nqp::decode(nqp::decont($myblob, Encoding::Registry.find("foobar"))

[18:14] <timotimo> ugh, we don't have a streaming decoder implementation for utf16

[18:14] <timotimo> setting the encoder properly seems to be set up for IO.open, but not for slurp and friends

[18:14] <timotimo> and also not for Blob.decode and such

[18:15] <timotimo> Str.encode on the other hand does query the registry

[18:18] <timotimo> or maybe the fix is so blatantly easy that i can just commit it right soon

[18:19] <timotimo> hackety hack …

[18:20] <ZzZombo> That would be best, not the hack, but fixing it.

[18:31] <timotimo> i'm not making much progress, and i've gotta go again

[18:33] <jstuder> Hey all. I have a question regarding the docs. In the "Truncating slices" section of /Language/subscripts it says that using a Range will truncate the output to only defined elements. But this is not currently the case in Rakudo.

[18:33] <jstuder> Is this a bug in Rakudo or an error in the docs? I can't find it in the specs or roast.

[18:34] <jnthn> m: my @a = 1..10; say @a[5..15]

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 149ed2429: OUTPUT: «(6 7 8 9 10 (Any) (Any) (Any) (Any) (Any) (Any))␤»

[18:34] <jnthn> m: my @a = 1..10; say @a[5..*]

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 149ed2429: OUTPUT: «(6 7 8 9 10)␤»

[18:34] <jnthn> It's only true for ranges with a * or Int endpoint

[18:34] <jnthn> And the general rule is that lazy = truncate, non-lazy = don't

[18:34] <jnthn> m: my @a = 1..10; say @a[lazy 5..15]

[18:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 149ed2429: OUTPUT: «(6 7 8 9 10)␤»

[18:34] <jstuder> yeah. the docs say it is the case for all ranges

[18:34] <jnthn> Yeah, that's not right

[18:35] <jstuder> ok i'll open an issue in the repo and can change that in the docs.

[18:35] <jstuder> thanks for the clarification

[18:38] <jstuder> I can add a new test in the roast as well to make it explicit that Non-lazy ranges/iterable means the potential of undefined elements

[18:42] <jnthn> I'm pretty sure there are some there

[18:42] <jnthn> I remember implementing these semantics (truncate if lazy, don't otherwise)

[18:42] <jstuder> Ok, but if not, I'll add them.

[18:43] <jnthn> The issue with ranges always truncating was things like @a[^10] = 1..10; on an empty @a would become a no-op :)

[18:43] <jnthn> Sure, please add any for things you feel aren't sufficiently covered :)

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> jstuder++

[18:44] <jstuder> Oh I see. yeah that would be a problem. I'll try to get all that in the docs

[20:41] <poohman> hello all

[20:41] <poohman> java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: blib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP.jar

[20:42] <poohman> this comes up when I try to use perl6-j

[20:42] <poohman> perl6-m works fine

[20:43] <poohman> I compiled rakudo with both backends

[20:43] *** lizmat joined
[20:44] <bartolin> poohman: hmm, what version of rakudo ddid you compile?

[20:45] <poohman> did a git clone today

[20:45] <poohman> let me check

[20:45] <poohman> This is Rakudo version 2017.10-211-g2f0da94c3 built on JVM

[20:45] <poohman> implementing Perl 6.c.

[20:45] *** comborico1611 left
[20:45] *** AndChat|688961 joined
[20:46] <bartolin> the jvm backend has a lot of issues, unfortunately. but it shouldn't fail like that ...

[20:46] <bartolin> do you get the same error if you run ./perl6-j -e '' in the directory where you build it?

[20:47] <poohman> let me try

[20:48] <bartolin> there definitely is an issue with 'make test' (which uses the EvalServer) before executing 'make install'. it fails with the same error, see https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132101

[20:52] <bartolin> poohman: I've run a spectest with a perl6-j just one commit older than yours. there are failing tests, but most things work fine.

[20:53] <poohman> ./perl6-j -e 'say "Hello"' works in the rakudo source folder

[20:53] <poohman> even perl6-j -e 'say Hello"' works

[20:54] *** char_var[buffer] left
[20:54] <bartolin> ah, good. and what caused the above error (NoSuchFileException)?

[20:54] <poohman> should I include the source folder in the PATHand try? to get the blib folder in

[20:54] <poohman> ?

[20:56] *** eroux joined
[20:59] <bartolin> after running 'make install' that shouldn't be necessary. could you gist the code that triggers the error? maybe that rings a bell with me.

[21:02] <poohman> https://paste.gnome.org/prdbbzp9z

[21:02] *** zakharyas joined
[21:03] <poohman> i had just used zef to install the modules

[21:03] <poohman> should I use zef-j also?

[21:04] <bartolin> last time i looked, zef did not work with perl6-j :-( I haven't tried in a while, though ...

[21:06] <poohman> i found something else

[21:06] <poohman> ~/source/rakudo/install/bin/perl6-j -e 'say "Hello"'

[21:06] <poohman> gives the same error

[21:08] <poohman> ~/source/rakudo/perl6-j -e 'say "hello"'

[21:08] <poohman> Error: Could not find or load main class perl6

[21:09] <poohman> this happens when my PWD is not ~/source/rakudo/

[21:09] <poohman> it works onlz when the PWD is ~/source/rakudo 

[21:12] <bartolin> poohman: yeah, i can reproduce it :/

[21:13] <poohman> ok so I hopefully didnt botch the install up

[21:14] <poohman> i tried the jvm backend only todaz

[21:14] <bartolin> poohman: no, it just doesn't look at the right place (and that's a bug). the BOOTSTRAP.jar file should be in your install dir under share/nqp/lib/Perl6/

[21:15] <poohman> ok

[21:16] <bartolin> poohman: the jvm backend is in bad shape. you really should use the moar backend, if you want to use perl6 (instead of hunting bugs :-)

[21:16] <bartolin> poohman: but this particular problem should be fixable. I'll take a closer look.

[21:17] <bartolin> so, thanks for bringing this up!

[21:18] <poohman> ok - was trying some clojure and scala - java interop was pretty easy - atleast in scala - but after seeing paul Phillips rants thought would be great if perl6 java interop worked

[21:20] <poohman> will try to get stuff done via nativecalls in moar - thanks for your help

[21:23] <bartolin> your welcome

[21:26] *** mson left
[21:29] <bartolin> poohman: it turns out there is a superfluous 'nqp-lib=blib' in the installed versions of 'perl6' and 'perl6-j'. removing that seems to help with finding BOOTSTRAP.jar. but as feared, installing zef fails after a while ...

[21:33] <poohman> you mean you cant install zef after removing it or zef cant install modules?

[21:50] <tyil> kline told me to talk to you as well

[21:51] <tyil> cool tho

[21:51] <tyil> can I request such a cloak? :3

[21:51] <mst> sending in a duplicate request and putting samcv's name on it without bothering to tell them you were doing that was not particularly good.

[21:52] <tyil> I didnt put her name in it tho

[21:54] * mst shrugs

[21:55] <mst> it's so much easier if you listen to people in channel sending you to the right place :P

[21:55] <tyil> that was past the time I contacted kline :(

[21:55] <mst> also staff *don't* give out project cloaks, projects do

[21:56] <mst> I just happen to be staff as well as perl+perl6 group contact

[21:59] <mst> yeah, it's all fine

[21:59] <mst> however, given just yesterday we had

[21:59] <mst> < ugexe> tyil: i would suggest removing the folder "perl6-nigger" from your distribution before uploading it to cpan (App-Cpan6-0.8.0.tar.gz)

[21:59] <mst> I don't think I'll be offering tyil a perl6 affiliated cloak for the moment

[22:00] <mst> anybody else who wants one is welcome to /msg me and ask

[22:00] <tyil> :<

[22:00] <tyil> that mistake was already fixed tho

[22:00] <simcop2387> i wouldn't mind one but i expect i should do something perl6 related first

[22:00] <mst> simcop2387: I was assuming you'd want a perl cloak if any

[22:01] <simcop2387> probably but i don't think i care. came here since i got an alert in here because of so many spammers using that word it's on a hilight for me now.
