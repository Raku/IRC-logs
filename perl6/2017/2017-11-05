[02:14] <comborico1611> Since a few new people came in, I'll ask again.  Why does Perl use the term routine instead of function?

[02:15] <timotimo> maybe to avoid using the mathematical term for something imperative?

[02:15] <comborico1611> Routine is a better name, in my opinion.  It's more descriptive.

[02:16] <comborico1611> "Imperative" as in giving a command.

[02:16] <comborico1611> Yes, that's good.

[02:17] <comborico1611> I don't like the term method. I prefer member-function.

[02:17] <comborico1611> I suppose member-routine is fine.

[02:18] <timotimo> well, imperative programming vs functional programming vs object-oriented vs ...

[02:20] <comborico1611> Reactive is the new one i just learned about.

[07:48] *** darutoko joined
[07:49] <geekosaur> structs as values is highly C compiler specific, and best handled by the C compiler itself. that said, I think timotimo was looking at switching NativeCall to use libffi, which claims to be able to do it on all supported platforms (but iirc it doesn't support all the platforms dyncall does)

[07:50] <geekosaur> likewise returning CStructs as values

[07:52] <azawawi> so what happens if you need to call a C function that expects a CStruct and not a pointer to a CStruct (i.e. without wrapping it)

[07:52] <geekosaur> you have to wrap it

[07:52] *** R0b0t1_ left
[07:53] <geekosaur> it is *always* passed by NativeCall as a pointer; 'is rw' just tells NativeCall to copy the values back into Perl after the call, in case the C function changed things in the pointed-to struct

[07:53] <azawawi> Missed the following: "CStruct objects are passed to native functions by reference and native functions must also return CStruct objects by reference." from documentation :)

[07:53] <azawawi> geekosaur++

[07:53] <azawawi> i think this needs to highlighted though

[07:53] *** Cabanossi left
[07:54] <azawawi> the nativecall documentation is great but needs examples

[07:54] <geekosaur> probably. It's not that unusual though; it's only recently that libffi supported passing structs by value, and several other languages' FFIs don't try to support struct passing/returning as values (e.g. Haskell)

[07:54] *** R0b0t1_ joined
[07:54] <geekosaur> the ones that do support it make you write C code

[07:55] <geekosaur> (lua, python, perl 5 since XS compiles to C)

[08:00] <azawawi> https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/issues/356

[08:01] <azawawi> and given no CStruct forward declarations  in Perl 6, there is a lot of wrapping needed

[08:02] <azawawi> given that msgpack_object is basically a struct with union of structs with pointers (CArrays) in them...

[12:08] <geekosaur> if you can't use $!b then you have to make it rw

[12:09] <HoboWithAShotgun> that's exactly what i wanted to avoid wander :)

[12:10] <lizmat> m: class A { has $.a is rw = "a" }; class B is A { method TWEAK(:$.a = "b") { } }; dd B.new   # HoboWithAShotgun 

[12:10] <wander> well

[12:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar d5fc6cbb9: OUTPUT: ¬´B.new(a => "b")‚ê§¬ª

[12:10] <lizmat> you *can* use :$.a

[12:10] <lizmat> which is just another way to write self.a

[12:10] <lizmat> but fits better in signatures  :-)

[12:12] <HoboWithAShotgun> yes, bt that still requires rw

[12:14] <lizmat> HoboWithAShotgun: yes, that's true

[12:15] <lizmat> HoboWithAShotgun: the alternative is to make A a role:

[12:15] <lizmat> role A { has $.a = "a" }; class B does A { method TWEAK(:$!a = "b") { } }; dd B.new(a => 42)

[12:15] <lizmat> m: role A { has $.a = "a" }; class B does A { method TWEAK(:$!a = "b") { } }; dd B.new(a => 42)

[12:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e4ef2e0f: OUTPUT: ¬´B.new(a => 42)‚ê§¬ª

[12:16] <lizmat> m: role A { has $.a = "a" }; class B does A { method TWEAK(:$!a = "b") { } }; dd B.new

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e4ef2e0f: OUTPUT: ¬´B.new(a => "b")‚ê§¬ª

[12:16] <lizmat> m: role A { has $.a = "a" }; class B does A { method TWEAK(:$!a = "b") { } }; dd A.new

[12:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 3e4ef2e0f: OUTPUT: ¬´A.new(a => "a")‚ê§¬ª

[12:16] <lizmat> you will still get to use A as a class, as it will autopun the role into a class as soon as it's used as a class

[12:16] <lizmat> basically doing a "class :: does A { }" for you

[12:17] <lizmat> brb&

[12:23] *** ChoHag left
[12:25] *** cdg joined
[12:28] <wander> lizmat: do we have something like `super` to invoke parent class in a child class?

[12:28] <wander> self invoke the object itself

[12:28] <wander> super invoke its parent

[12:28] <wander> thus we can pass message from child to parent

[12:29] <lizmat> wander: there's only one object

[12:29] <lizmat> which happens to have attributes from the parent and attributes from the child

[12:29] <wander> yes

[12:30] <lizmat> wander: perhaps "trusts" is what you need?  https://docs.perl6.org/routine/trusts

[13:26] <dakkar> jnthn: Cro queston: how would I implement a ::Router-based transformer that "wraps" another one? for authentication purposes, for example

[13:27] <dakkar> get -> *@, :$user!, :$pass! { if authentication-ok($user,$pass) { go-ahead-to-the-inner-transformer(...) } else { forbidden ... } }

[13:27] <dakkar> how do I do the "go-ahead-" part?

[13:27] <dakkar> alternatively, what's the smarter way of doing this?

[13:28] <HoboWithAShotgun> allright, in here: https://hastebin.com/qumiqosabo.pl, is there a way to not having to tell the type Foo as a string?

[13:28] <HoboWithAShotgun> basically can a role know who is "doing" it?

[13:29] <lizmat> HoboWithAShotgun: is it intentional that there is only one instance ?

[13:29] *** cdg joined
[13:29] <HoboWithAShotgun> That is indeed the point. yes :)

[13:30] <dakkar> HoboWithAShotgun: the invocant to a method will be the type object, won't it?

[13:30] <dakkar> also, you have one $instance per process, regardless of how many clasess consume the role

[13:31] <HoboWithAShotgun> oh.

[13:45] <census> dakkar oh i understand sorry i freaked out

[13:45] <dakkar> extra pairs of eyes are always useful üòú

[13:46] <dakkar> although, if the implicit decoder told you where it's reading from and what it found, figuring out the problem would be easier

[13:46] <dakkar> (but I suspect that it's quite a bit harder to do than to say, given the many layers involved)

[15:04] <dakkar> I am!

[15:05] <census> i'm trying to write another code. would you please be willing to take a look at it?

[15:06] <jnthn> dakkar: Cro works less in terms of "wrapping" and more in terms of a linear pipeline. For auth, I'd approach it in the same way that we handle HTTP2 ping/window update/settings ack: have something in the pipeline ahead of request processing that applies the auth checks, and if it wants to bypass the rest, then emits the response into a Supplier in ConnectionState, and the another step in the processing pipeline later subscribes to that and spits i

[15:09] *** vike left
[15:09] <jnthn> On auth stuff in general, my thinking is to add something to the request object that carries an "identity", and also provide access to it in the route signature

[15:09] <dakkar> I'm not ever sure what you expect it to do‚Ä¶

[15:10] *** Cabanossi joined
[15:10] *** HoboWithAShotgun left
[15:11] <dakkar> jnthn: oh, so I could do ¬´get -> 'something', :$user is identity { ... }¬ª

[15:11] <jnthn> So if it was a JWT with a bunch of permissions, one could write Admin :$user is identity, having declared subset Admin where *.perms.any eq 'admin'

[15:11] <dakkar> clever!

[15:13] *** blakebooyah joined
[15:13] <dakkar> oh, another detail I'm not sure about: if I have multiple routes that could match a request, which one is picked? narrower, first, last?

[15:13] <dakkar> random? ‚ò∫

[15:13] <jnthn> No, the rules are actually quite Perl 6-y :)

[15:14] <jnthn> See near the end of the http://cro.services/docs/reference/cro-http-router#URI_segment_matching docs

[15:15] *** blakebooyah left
[15:16] <jnthn> The rules are inspired by Perl 6's LTM semantics (the longest literal part) and multi-dispatch semantics (the other parts)

[15:17] <jnthn> The first bit being handy because it means we can compile the route table into regex and then let Perl 6 build an NFA to do the route matching for us

[15:17] <dakkar> I should actually read the docs, you know. I was going to reverse-engineer the matcher compiler to figure out the logic ‚ò∫

[15:18] <dakkar> (or maybe I could have looked at the tests)

[15:18] <jnthn> That may be more fun ;)

[17:12] <moritz> comborico1611: you need to separate statements with a semicolon, a statement ends with }\n

[17:13] <comborico1611> Are you saying a statement can end with either a semicolon, brace, or new line?

[17:14] <moritz> no

[17:14] <comborico1611> The author has yet to use };  

[17:14] <moritz> I'm saying that you need to separate statements with a semicolon, which means the semicolon after the last statement in a block or a file is optional

[17:15] <moritz> and you don't need one if the previous statement ended with a } *and* there is a newline after it

[17:15] <comborico1611> Yeah when I enter his code into this terminal thing, it errors unless I put };

[17:15] <moritz> m: sub f() { 1 } sub g() { }

[17:15] <moritz> here there is no newline after the }

[17:16] <moritz> so you need a semicolon

[17:16] <moritz> m: sub f() { 1 }; sub g() { }

[17:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1c387153e: ( no output )

[17:16] <moritz> or a newline:

[17:16] <moritz> m: sub f() { 1 }‚ê§ sub g() { }

[17:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 1c387153e: ( no output )

[17:16] <moritz> (camelia translates ‚ê§ into actual newlines on input, and vice versa on output)

[17:17] <comborico1611> OHH!

[17:17] <comborico1611> The issue is because I'm entering this code on my phone, and I'm not indenting anything.

[17:22] <comborico1611> You get me?

[17:25] <comborico1611> So the indent feature is very similar to pythons indent feature, where you don't need a semicolon.

[17:26] *** ryn1x joined
[17:26] <dakkar> uh‚Ä¶ there's no "indent feature"

[17:26] <dakkar> just "close-brace + newline, terminates the statement"

[17:26] <dakkar> that's all there is

[17:27] <comborico1611> If you enter code all in one line, you must use close brace semicolon. But if you and dents you don't need to put the semicolon after every code block (except the last one).

[17:27] <moritz> it's the newline that's important, not the indention

[17:28] <comborico1611> I see.

[17:41] <timotimo> gfldex: is "stay tuning" a pun or typo?

[17:42] <gfldex> all my typos are puntastic!

[17:42] <lizmat> gfldex++  # I'm tempted to just import your httpd code into Telemetry

[17:42] <gfldex> was meant as a pun tho

[17:43] <gfldex> lizmat: it needs a little more error handling first

[17:43] <timotimo> OK

[17:43] <lizmat> gfldex: ok, well I have another idea to play with

[17:44] <lizmat> basically Telemetry atm is two sets of Telemetry data: from nqp::rusage, and from ThreadPoolScheduler

[17:44] <lizmat> I was thinking of abstracting these into an Telemetry::Instrument::Rusage and a Telemetry::Instrument::ThreadPool

[17:45] <lizmat> and creating a Telemetry::Instrument role with which you could create your own "instruments"

[17:46] <jdv79> what's the simplest way to handle daylight savings in p6

[17:47] <lizmat> jdv79: standard p6 is timezone agnostic afaik, so there is no handling ?

[17:47] <jdv79> i realize that.  hence my question.

[17:49] <lizmat> http://modules.perl6.org/dist/DateTime::TimeZone:github:Timothy%20Totten ??

[17:50] <jdv79> i guess

[17:51] *** zakame left
[17:51] <dakkar> dst is part of timezone info, which is a mess because humans

[17:53] <dakkar> oh, that library looks a bit misguided‚Ä¶

[17:55] <dakkar> (a tz is a pair of functions between a human-readable representation of a point in time, and the actual point in time)

[17:59] <jdv79> m: DateTime.now.earlier(days => 1).truncated-to('day');

[17:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77142fdb2: ( no output )

[17:59] <jdv79> m: DateTime.now.earlier(days => 1).truncated-to('day').day;

[17:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77142fdb2: ( no output )

[17:59] <jdv79> m: DateTime.now.earlier(days => 1).truncated-to('day').say;

[17:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77142fdb2: OUTPUT: ¬´2017-11-04T00:00:00+01:00‚ê§¬ª

[17:59] <jdv79> well for me that's confusing because the TZ offset of y'day is -5 accoring to perl6 but it was actually 4

[17:59] <jdv79> -4

[18:00] <jdv79> i'm in ET

[18:01] <jdv79> in other words, DateTime allows for non-instanct manipulation but fouls the TZ

[18:01] *** Khisanth left
[18:02] *** setty1 joined
[18:03] <dakkar> jdv79: DateTime seems to have no idea what a timezone is

[18:03] <dakkar> it seems to only know offsets

[18:03] <dakkar> (which are almost always the wrong thing to care about)

[18:03] <dakkar> ¬´Int :$timezone¬ª aaargh

[18:04] <dakkar> I suspect that the DateTime class is a bit sub-optimal at date/time math

[18:04] <timotimo> dakkar: in minutes

[18:04] <dakkar> no

[18:04] <timotimo> oh

[18:04] <dakkar> a timezone is not an offset

[18:04] <dakkar> a timezone is a pair of functions, DateTime --> Int

[18:04] <jdv79> its still troublesome that the class offers higher level manip but doesn't carry the offset through them

[18:04] <dakkar> argh, sorry, not that signature

[18:04] <jdv79> i find it confusing

[18:05] <dakkar> a timezone is a pair of functions to convert between point-in-time, and human-readable representations of points-in-time

[18:05] <dakkar> so maybe DateTime --> Instant, and Instant --> DateTime

[18:06] <dakkar> e.g. timezone "Europe/Rome" converts posix-epoch+1509905188seconds into "Sun Nov  5 19:06:28 CET 2017"

[18:07] <dakkar> or something like that

[18:07] <dakkar> an offset is part of that conversion

[18:08] <dakkar> or maybe it's just the result of diffing two human representations of the same instant, using different tz

[18:08] <dakkar> (why am I trying to channel Zefram??)

[18:28] <comborico1611> Why does it matter not including braces?

[18:29] <Zoffix> comborico1611: first, your last version is missing a term for the LHS of the `*` operator. Second, if you added that you'd have a block WITH a WhateverCode inside (and it either errors out or warns).

[18:31] <Zoffix> m: my @evens = map * * 2, 1..5; say @evens # can write this too.
