[10:08] <Zoffix> DrForr: ok do { my $setup = 1; return 3 }, 'the block returns true'

[10:11] <Zoffix> well, can't `return` from a block, but just use `do`. No need to invent anything new :)

[10:30] <Zoffix> Also, we already have a `does-ok` with a different meaning :)

[10:30] <Zoffix> m: use Test; does-ok 42, Numeric

[10:37] <HoboWithAShotgun> how do i turn an into into a hexadecimal string representation?

[10:37] <HoboWithAShotgun> s/an/an Int/

[10:37] <jnthn> m: say 16.base(16)

[10:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´10‚ê§¬ª

[10:38] <HoboWithAShotgun> ?? i thought it tried that

[10:38] <moritz> m: printf '%x', 32

[10:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´20¬ª

[10:42] <moritz> m: say '20'.unbase(16)

[10:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'unbase' for invocant of type 'Str'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[10:42] <moritz> m: say :16('20')

[10:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´32‚ê§¬ª

[10:44] <HoboWithAShotgun> m: "0;255;12".split(";").map({ .Int }).map({ sprintf("%02x", $_) }).join.say

[10:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´00ff0c‚ê§¬ª

[10:44] <HoboWithAShotgun> fine. but is there a better way?

[10:44] <Zoffix> perlawhirl: there are 4 syntaxes for the object hash thing: `my Int %h` constraints *values* to just `Int` objects; `my %h{Int}` constrains *keys* to just `Int`; you can combine these two and write, say, `my Num %h{Int}` to constrain keys to Int and values to Num; there's also `Hash[Num].new: 42 => 2e0`, `Hash[Num,Int].new: 42 => 2e0` or `Hash.^parameterize(Num,Int).new: 42, 2e0` to do the same; except here

[10:44] <Zoffix> you can do it with values from variables and stuff. And lastly, there's the `:{ }` circumfix op that creates an object hash with `Mu` constrainted values and `Any` constrainted keys.

[10:45] <HoboWithAShotgun> m: "0;255;12".split(";").map({ sprintf("%02x", .Int) }).join.say

[10:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´00ff0c‚ê§¬ª

[10:45] <moritz> m: say "0;255;12".split(';')¬ª.Int¬ª.fmt('%02x').join

[10:49] <Zoffix> tyil: a few moons ago [Coke] mentioned it to TPF, but I guess it never got fixed

[10:49] <tyil> neat

[10:49] <tyil> Zoffix: is there a public repo for this where I can put up a PR?

[10:51] <Zoffix> c: HEAD use lib <data/all-modules/zoffixznet/perl6-Color/lib>; use Color; Color.new(|"0;255;12".comb(/\d+/)¬ª.Int).say

[10:51] <Zoffix> I guess that ain't much improvement....

[10:52] <Zoffix> tyil: don't know. Ask [Coke] or lizmat. They're the TPF people

[10:53] <tyil> [Coke], lizmat: it looks like there's an encoding bug on https://donate.perlfoundation.org/, in the third paragraph it shows √¢‚Ç¨≈ìPerl√¢‚Ç¨

[10:53] <Zoffix> m: "0;255;12".comb(/\d+/)¬ª.fmt("%02x").join.say

[10:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a28c00: OUTPUT: ¬´00ff0c‚ê§¬ª

[10:53] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: ^ two better ways

[10:53] <lizmat> hmmm... wonder being on the Grant Committee makes you a TPF person

[10:54] <HoboWithAShotgun> ty zoffix. but terminal::ansicolor and the rest don't deal with rgb colors, they are all just using the 16 color palette

[10:54] <lizmat> anyways, [Coke] would be the person to be able to actually fix that, I have no access to the perlfoundation site

[10:54] <Zoffix> Ah :) my bad

[10:54] <tyil> he's been highlighted a couple times now, I guess he'll read back what the fuss was

[10:55] <DrForr> HoboWithAShotgun: Yeah, 'Color' is an overloaded term :)

[10:56] <HoboWithAShotgun> that's why my module to deal with them is called Terminal::Vision::Screen::Driver::Xterm

[10:57] <HoboWithAShotgun> Of course there's other stuff too under T::V

[10:57] <Zoffix> You should make a PR to Color to add a method for conversion to 16 pallet :)

[10:58] <tyil> Zoffix: that would only work decently if one uses the default 16 color, but its not uncommon for people to define their own colors in their terminal

[10:58] <Zoffix> Ah, OK

[10:58] * Zoffix &

[10:58] <tyil> I've even made a little config change to make the console use slightly different colors to fit better with my main terminal emulator's colors

[10:58] <HoboWithAShotgun> besides color matching ain't easy

[10:59] *** domidumont left
[10:59] <HoboWithAShotgun> i mean mathematically it is, but your brain/eyes beg to differ with the math at times

[11:00] <DrForr> All the more reason to have a module for it so others don't have to do the math :)

[12:15] <HoboWithAShotgun> now i wish i could control the scope better. if i declare the enum lexical in a package, it's useless. if i use our all these symbols pollute the namespace and potentially collide. and "is export" isn't working

[17:17] <samcv> so for RTL text. it's still encoded the same

[17:17] *** setty1 joined
[17:17] <samcv> the "first" character comes first and last comes last

[17:18] <tyil> AlexDaniel_: I'll get on with HMAC stuff first, that looks more useful 

[17:18] <samcv> it's only display that is different. i.e. if a user were typing it on their keyboard. (that order)

[17:18] *** mr-foobar joined
[17:18] <robertle> but in right-to-left text the first/rightmost character comes first in the character sequence, correct?

[17:18] <samcv> yes. as they would type it

[17:18] <samcv> it is only display which is different. but input is the order that it is typed in

[17:18] <robertle> in the line I highlighted, the "first" farsi character comes last in the farsi sequence, so that it renders ok in left-to-right

[17:19] *** wamba joined
[17:19] <robertle> so basically it is wrong, but looks correct

[17:19] <samcv> first in rtl would be the right most

[17:19] <robertle> but that type of wrong is all I can do in a mixed LRT and RTL file

[17:20] <samcv> oh so you're saying it's arabic script rendering LTR?

[17:20] <samcv> so it's reversed?

[17:20] <robertle> correct!

[17:20] <samcv> (in the encoding)

[17:20] <samcv> hah

[17:20] <samcv> you can use .flip i suppose to flip it and test against both?

[17:20] <robertle> I believe that is the only way I can put arabic words in my text file with other languages

[17:20] <samcv> well. it depends on what is displaying it

[17:20] <samcv> what is your editor?

[17:21] <robertle> right, that's what i am wondering: does the flip and match work in all cases? it does work in any script or unicode range that I understand, like the example:

[17:21] <robertle> 'ofenrohr'.flip ~~ /'rnef'/

[17:21] <robertle> but does that work across all unicode ranges?

[17:22] <robertle> I guess that bils down to me not undertsanding what a "grapheme" is...

[17:22] <samcv> yeah

[17:22] <samcv> well. ok. it doesn't flip codepoints but flips graphemes

[17:22] <robertle> right, and that is where my confusion comes in

[17:22] <samcv> m: say "√°"\c[COMBINING CARON]".flip

[17:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar c73221: OUTPUT: ¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Confused‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3say "√°"\7‚èè5c[COMBINING CARON]".flip‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        postfix‚ê§¬ª

[17:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar c73221: OUTPUT: ¬´√°Ãå‚ê§¬ª

[17:23] <samcv> so that isn't flipped becuase it's one grapheme. it doesn't flip codepoints. i mean what are you trying to do?

[17:23] <samcv> who is this for? is it just because your own editor doesn't support RTL text?

[17:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar c73221: OUTPUT: ¬´€å⁄Ø⁄ò€åŸêŸà‚ê§¬ª

[17:27] <samcv> that's the difference between doing it by grapheme with flip and reversing the codepoints

[17:27] <samcv> m: "ŸàŸê€å⁄ò⁄Ø€å".chars.say; "ŸàŸê€å⁄ò⁄Ø€å".codes.say

[17:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar c73221: OUTPUT: ¬´5‚ê§6‚ê§¬ª

[17:29] <robertle> ah, that's interesting! about the editor: that appears to be the core problem really. how to put both LTR and RTL text into one file and keeping it accessible...

[17:29] <squashable6> Webhook for MoarVM/MoarVM is now active! It's not fully shipped until it's fast.

[17:29] <AlexDaniel_> samcv: ‚Üë thanks :)

[17:30] <AlexDaniel_> timotimo: do you have access to rakudo repo settings?

[17:33] <robertle> thinking more about it, reversing the characters in the file just to make it look right in some random cases seems to be a stupid idea...

[17:33] <samcv> yay

[17:33] <samcv> \o/

[17:34] <HoboWithAShotgun> can i have method aliases? i know i can export what i want, but maybe i can do something like "method foo alias bar"

[17:34] <yoleaux> 14:36Z <japhb> HoboWithAShotgun: Terminal::ANSIColor does indeed support extended color escape codes, see https://github.com/tadzik/Terminal-ANSIColor/blob/master/example.pl

[17:34] <timotimo> AlexDaniel_: it doesn't seem so, no

[17:34] <AlexDaniel_> timotimo: do you know who does?

[17:34] <samcv> robertle, i mean you could insert a code to force RTL? though idk if the editor doesn't support it then

[17:34] <samcv> may be out of luck anyway. depending on what the issue is

[17:37] <timotimo> AlexDaniel_: no clue :\

[20:01] <thou> There seems to be an error with */tbrowder/* entries in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/ecosystem/master/META.list

[20:01] <thou> dups pointing to various commit hashes instead of /master/

[20:02] <thou> resulting in broken module pages, e.g. http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Text::More

[20:02] <moritz> seems to be multiple releases

[20:02] <thou> (I assume it's the cause of the breakage)

[20:03] *** rba joined
[20:03] <moritz> which breakage?

[20:03] <thou> http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Text::More

[20:03] <thou> none of those links go to anything useful

[20:04] <moritz> no?

[20:04] <moritz> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbrowder/Net-IP-Lite-Perl6/5c276aa50069c7bf7e6c379865ae08c7fdce971f/META6.json

[20:04] <moritz> seems to point to version 0.1.2 of Net::IP::Lite

[20:04] <moritz> what's not useful about that?

[20:05] <thou> Do you find that on http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Text::More ?

[20:06] <thou> I'm just seeing 4 links that all go to http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Text::More:github:github:tbrowder

[20:06] <thou> and when clicking on that link, it's the same content as http://modules.perl6.org/dist/Text::More

[20:06] <moritz> that looks like problem with modules.perl6.org to me, not with the ecosystem list

[20:06] <moritz> or simply a "not yet implemented"

[20:07] *** synergy left
[20:07] *** rjbs joined
[20:08] <thou> could be; i'd assumed that ecosystem list wasn't intended to have multiple links for a single module

[20:11] *** Zoffix joined
[20:11] *** ChoHag joined
[20:12] *** Xal left
[20:13] <Zoffix> It's both a now-pointless dupping of entries in meta-list and a NYI on modules.perl6.org of being able to distinguish when multiple metas point to the same dist but multiple versions (they're uniqued on meta URLs)

[20:13] <thou> I do get meaningful results from `zef search Text::More` (lists ::ver<0.1.{2, 3, 4, 7}>). That's probably not useful in this particular case but it's at least intelligible.

[20:14] <Zoffix> thou: do you get the same for dists without multiple metas in the list? I think zef has some service running that fishes out which commits correspond to which version

[20:16] <thou> it just shows `List::Utils` or `Test::Harness` in those two cases, no explicit version in the module name

[20:17] <thou> Not sure if there might be some subset of modules that zef knows more version info about.

[20:17] *** Xal joined
[20:17] <thou> I am assuming that it's looking at the META6.json files pointed to by those 4 Text-More lines in ecosystem and reporting version from there.

[20:17] <thou> Or something similar

[20:19] *** astj joined
[20:21] *** skids left
[20:23] *** astj left
[20:23] <thou> I'd be happy to just remove the commit-hash-referenced entries and keep things simple, but perhaps there is more that should be done

[20:25] <Zoffix> would be nice to teach mp6o to link to different versions of p6c dists

[20:25] <Zoffix> (using the same service zef uses to find version bump commits)
