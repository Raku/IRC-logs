[03:24] <skids> hashes are iteratable and iterables blow up if they are the single argument, is why.

[03:24] *** virtualsue left
[03:25] <skids> With the comma, the single iterable argument is the list which the comma made.

[03:26] <PapaChub> For all the times, e.g., JSON barfs on "extraneous" commas, it seems odd that it's significant here

[03:47] *** troys_ is now known as troys

[03:47] <geekosaur> this was NQPRoutine that came up iirc

[03:50] <todd> geekosaur: yes we did.  The routine given in https://docs.perl6.org/type/CallFrame is foobar.  Timo went into it.  Look for the third post under subject: "what am I doing wrong here?"

[03:50] <geekosaur> yes, that's what I was talking about

[03:50] <geekosaur> so you hit a rakudo bug that needs to be fixed

[03:50] <todd> Lucky me!  Huh!

[03:51] *** Exodist left
[03:51] <geekosaur> there may not be a good workaround in the meantime, since internals-leaking bugs are often hard to get around without digging into internals

[03:51] <geekosaur> and you probably don't want to have to mess with nqp just to find out your caller

[03:51] *** pilne left
[03:52] *** Exodist joined
[03:52] <todd> I may just wait until `https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=123826` gets fixed.  I will play a bit with callframe to see what it will cough up.

[03:53] <geekosaur> I should probably also ask if you figured out the other issue

[03:53] *** pyrimidine joined
[03:53] *** pyrimidine left
[03:53] <todd> I program in top down.  When a lot of folks are calling a sub, I sometimes need to know who the culprit was that sent bad data

[03:53] <geekosaur> perl 6 subs are lexical, perl 5's are (by default) shared and externally visible

[03:54] <geekosaur> you might want to consider inverting it for now: instead of trying to find that out yourself, immediately return a Failure and let the culprit handle it :)

[03:54] <geekosaur> (or not, and explode in their context instead of yours)

[03:55] <geekosaur> the NQPRoutine issue might not let you find out who called you, but the Failure will remember where it came from

[03:55] <todd> "lexical" doesn't mean anythign to me.  I look it up int he disctionary and I understand for about three minutes.  Would you mind writing out what you mean without that word.

[03:55] <geekosaur> I showed it to you in my last email

[03:56] <todd> I adore the method in the sub because I only have to write the degubbing code one and not into every caller

[03:56] <geekosaur> m: module A { sub foo { say "nope" }; our sub bar { say "yep" } }; A::bar(); # bar has a globally visible name

[03:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 627de7: OUTPUT: ¬´yep‚ê§¬ª

[03:56] <todd> what was the subject line of the eMail?

[03:56] <geekosaur> m: module A { sub foo { say "nope" }; our sub bar { say "yep" } }; A::foo(); # foo's name only exists within A

[03:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 627de7: OUTPUT: ¬´Could not find symbol '&foo'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[03:57] <geekosaur> in perl 5, both of those would be visible from outside (and before 5.18 you couldn't even put 'our' on it)

[03:58] <todd> oh.  I played a bit with it and saved it for when I have time and not a bunch of stuff tearing at me (I am a computer jack of all trades)

[03:59] <geekosaur> so basically you can only use Module::subname if it was declared "our". in perl 5 you can "always" use it (perl 5.18+ has local subs, but they were/maybe still are? apparently broken)

[03:59] <geekosaur> so the only way to do that is to make them all "our" subs

[04:01] <geekosaur> I think at some point there is supposed to be a pragma that lets you specify defaults (like 'our') but it doesn't exist yet

[04:03] <todd> What cionfused me was that the sub came from a module (pm6).  I did not know where to put the "our".  `our sub Which($ProgramName) is export {good stuff;}` or put it is the "use" (our use)?  I was also told that specifying what subs you want to import from modules is still on the drawing board.  That is why you saw me comment is out `use CheckDependancies; # qw[Which]`

[04:03] <geekosaur> the former

[04:04] <geekosaur> this is specifying in the definition of the sub that it is to be part of the module's symbol table (so Module::name works)

[04:04] <todd> Sorry for all the typos.  

[04:05] <geekosaur> it is distinct from 'is export' which means some other module can request that an alias to it be installed, so you can call it *without* the Module::

[04:05] <geekosaur> and if you do neither then it's not accessible from outside the defining module at all

[04:06] <todd> I like it!  That way I don't have to 1) worry obout duplicate names and 2) don't have to scratch my head trying to figure out where that came from.  I came from Modula2.  I use modules A LOT.  That is where I got the Top Down too.  They take longer to write, but are insanely easier to maintain.

[04:08] <todd> I am copying and pasting myself an eMail of what you just wrote me.  Thank you!  You are a good teacher.  There is a tallent to that all of its own.

[04:16] <todd> I put together a quick test of callframe.  It got kind of weird. See http://vpaste.net/yawFm

[04:24] <todd> Is `m:` part of the code or part of the chat line?

[04:24] *** geekosaur joined
[04:26] <PapaChub> No, that's to run the example.  Basically `callframe(1).code.name` is a [VERY!] Quick-and-Dirty way to get your caller's name.  Like I say, though, it's totally not production-quality!  (What happens if you're called from a closure, or anonymous sub, e.g.)

[04:26] *** kannan joined
[04:27] <todd> oh no problem there.  Todd is not smart enought to  use closures or anonymous subs!  It pays to be a dumbdumb at times!

[04:31] <todd> made me look up `note`!  Cool.  I use the $*ERR a bunch and it will be easier to use that writing it all out for "say"

[04:39] <SmokeMachine> is that ok if on Callable's .assuming I transform the Callable (WhateverCode) into a Block (using EVAL) and use its .assuming?

[04:40] <SmokeMachine> skids: ^^

[04:40] *** BenGoldberg left
[04:41] <skids> You mean for a rakudo patch or as a workaround in general code?

[04:41] <SmokeMachine> rakudo patch...

[04:42] <SmokeMachine> i don't think its pretty... but even the original Block's .assuming uses multiple EVALs...

[04:42] <SmokeMachine> to construct signatures...

[04:43] <skids> I think what we should do is have callable stub (require, via interface) a method assuming, add an "NYI" method to ForeignCode, and write an assuming for WhateverCode.  Because WhateverCode only has positionals and its .assuming can be much, much simpler.

[04:44] <skids> (or find out who all the users of Foreigncode are and add "NYI" methods there.)

[04:44] <SmokeMachine> that makes sense...

[04:45] <SmokeMachine> this was my first try: https://github.com/FCO/rakudo/commit/e9aa878419ddf105ddf89f5854eb4461cd92bfe8

[04:46] <SmokeMachine> ill move it to WhateverCode and try to make it better...

[04:47] <skids> As far as getting rid of the EVALs in Block.assuming, really what needs to happen is meta-api's into World and the VM binder have to be made available.  Otherwise you'd end up reimplementing a whole lot of QAST construction.

[08:57] <moritz> you can't

[08:57] <moritz> lexpads are immutable at run time

[08:57] <moritz> the only thing you can do is something  my &newsub = EVAL '...';

[08:58] <moritz> the REPL cheats by putting subsequent lines in artificial inner scopes

[08:59] <redhands> ah thanks

[08:59] *** scovit joined
[09:00] <scovit> Hello, the docs states that declaring your own ".new" makes correct initialization of objects from subclasses harder, how to deal with the issue?

[09:00] <scovit> specifically, how to make a subclass of the class Proxy, which provides her own ".new" ?

[09:01] <moritz> why do you need a separate .new method?

[09:01] <scovit> the question is how to make a subclass of Proxy, I can sacrify the new method in the subclass

[09:02] *** adu joined
[09:02] <scovit> I need to add some attributes, a DESTROY and specific FETCH and STORE to proxy

[09:03] <scovit> last part less important then adding a DESTROY

[09:03] <moritz> what are you trying to achieve?

[09:03] <scovit> just a Proxy with a DESTROY would be fine

[09:03] <scovit> this ^

[09:04] <moritz> no, that doesn't answer my question

[09:04] *** cdg joined
[09:04] <moritz> why do you want/need it?

[09:04] <scovit> to free up memory once the proxy get garbaged

[09:04] <moritz> which memory?

[09:05] <moritz> 'cause in general, the GC frees memory for you

[09:05] <scovit> memory I allocate in the method with calls Proxy.new, or in FETCH. using a LEAVE dont work because a Fetch get called x4 times what would be needed

[09:06] <scovit> for instance when say proxy; instead of my $a = Proxy.

[09:06] <moritz> but if that memory is only referenced in the proxy, the GC will automatically collect it for you

[09:06] <scovit> I honestly think those are all bugs but can leave with it if the language is flexible enough to give workarounds

[09:06] <scovit> moritz it doesnt

[09:06] <moritz> then yes, it's a bug and needs to be reported and fixed

[09:07] <scovit> the memory is allocated by nativecall

[09:07] *** adu left
[09:07] <moritz> hmm, that might be tricky; but putting the handling into a Proxy sounds like the wrong idea

[09:08] <scovit> why Proxy has a .new method in the first place?

[09:08] <moritz> fwiw the problem with subclassing Proxy is that Proxy is marked as a container (so that it's ignored in type checks etc.)

[09:08] *** cdg left
[09:08] <scovit> I just need a "smarter" proxy, nothing more or nothing less

[09:09] <moritz> seems like Proxy.new is a performance optimization

[09:10] <moritz> if you look at BOOTSTRAP.nqp in rakudo's source, there's a call to nqp::setcontspec

[09:10] <moritz> that's what a subclass of Proxy likely also needs

[09:10] <scovit> thanks, I'll look

[09:11] <scovit> should be fine to reimplement proxy if it is not that big

[09:11] *** TEttinger left
[09:17] *** cdg joined
[09:17] *** xtreak joined
[09:18] <redhands> hmm, so is there is a simple way to pass a context to EVAL, or a simple way to do the same cheating that REPL does? Ideally would like to call the REPL, all I need is for stdout to be immediately flushed after every write.

[11:02] <stmuk> abraxxa: lowercase the Cro to cro

[11:03] * stmuk wonders if anyone uses "local" in rakudobrew

[11:03] <jnthn> I wonder if zef is case-insensitive on distribution names? The actual distribution name is "cro", not "Cro"

[11:03] <abraxxa> hm, -Ilib doesn't work either

[11:04] <jnthn> Since what it gets you is the "cro" executable

[11:04] <cschwenz> abraxxa: hmm, i haven't ran into that because i always start me perl6 test files with use v6; use Test; use lib 'lib';         :-(

[11:04] <stmuk> jnthn: I think zef is genreally sensitive

[11:05] <Xliff> abraxxa: Yeah. That's why I asked my earlier question.

[11:05] <jnthn> stmuk: Hm, interesting, I wonder why "zef install Cro" did anything other than an error, then...

[11:08] <jnthn> Also those things in the cro-http repo

[11:09] <abraxxa> ok

[11:09] <Xliff> Has cglobal matured to the point where you can use a version number instead of using a full lib name?

[11:09] <Xliff> Ala cglobal('xml2', v2, 'symbolname', int32)

[11:10] *** geekosaur joined
[11:11] <abraxxa> jnthn: what about ssl params, rename those to TLS too?

[11:11] <jnthn> Yeah, distribution names and module names are two separate namespaces. There actually is no Cro::Core module, but there is a Cro::Core distribution.

[11:12] <jnthn> abraxxa: Ummm..hmmm

[11:12] <jnthn> abraxxa: Maybe alias them?

[11:12] *** llfourn left
[11:12] <jnthn> :tls-config(:$ssl-config) lets us accept both

[11:14] <jnthn> Young doesn't mean zero users :)

[11:14] <jnthn> We don't have to keep the alias forever, it'll just smooth things over a bit for current users, and while we update docs etc.

[11:15] <abraxxa> ok

[11:15] <abraxxa> env vars?

[11:15] <jnthn> Hm, which ones?

[11:16] <stmuk> I think the dependency order for installing Cro rather cro was wrong when I tried and abraxxa seems to see something similar

[11:16] * jnthn can't immediately think of one with SSL in it

[11:16] <abraxxa> jnthn: HTTPService.pm6 line 124 and 130

[11:16] <Xliff> jnthn: The only problem with that is that libxml2 has its own globals. I don't know if what I describe will handle those, or even if I have to worry about them.

[11:17] <jnthn> abraxxa: ah, yeah, I forgot about those

[11:17] <jnthn> abraxxa: Just rename those, I think

[11:17] <abraxxa> ok

[11:21] <timo> is Cro::TLS more than just refering to SSL by the proper name? :P

[13:02] <Zoffix> .oO( stub required methods? An obvious answer, so there's probably a reason why it's not really workable in this case ) 

[13:03] <grondilu> shouldn't Numeric have a default Bridge to NaN or something?

[13:03] <Zoffix> Maybe

[13:03] <scovit> I can imagine that the signature of $b keeps fetching and fetching and fetching... but I am missing a piece of knowledge

[13:04] <perlpilot> It's been a while since this has happened, but lately I look at #perl6 and think "what are they talking about?!?"   ;-)

[13:04] <Zoffix> scovit: just so you know: nqp is not meant for end users. We're free to change it at will and without notice, so if you use it, you risk code breakages in the future

[13:04] <scovit> Zoffix: thanks I acknoledge

[13:05] <Zoffix> The whole .Bridge thing looks superfluous to me.

[13:05] *** kannan joined
[13:05] <Zoffix> It coerces to Num, so why not just use .Num instead of .Bridge vOv

[13:08] *** Cabanossi left
[13:09] *** Cabanossi joined
[13:09] <grondilu> isn't Bridge more general than that?

[13:09] *** HoboWithAShotgun left
[13:09] <grondilu> since it's being used by other roles

[13:10] <scovit> Zoffix: imagine somebody which loves Perl has some time to spare, start to program in Perl6. At first he is excited: so many nice new features! He takes some time, he ports some libs using nativecall. Then he want to really do things in Perl 6 which you cannot do in other languages but which the docs claim to be doable

[13:10] *** void1 joined
[13:11] <scovit> he discovers that most of the library is written in another language, nqp. Then he is presented with a blue pill: take it and it will be all just a bad dream

[13:11] <Zoffix> grondilu: I only ever seen it coerce to Num; what other types have it?

[13:12] <Zoffix> scovit: sure. Learn nqp :) Then you can help us with core hacking :) 

[13:13] <Zoffix> I was just pointing it out in case you assumed that was user-facing stuff and was meant to follow same changes policy as the rest of Rakudo.

[13:13] <BooK> the way I understand scovit's argument is that the whole "Perl6 is written in Perl6" is a half-truth

[13:13] *** strangemk2 left
[13:14] <Zoffix> It's not true at all, I'd say :)

[13:14] <teatime> c'est la interpreters

[13:14] <scovit> Zoffix I am mostly inclined to learn npq in order to accomplish my project

[13:14] <Zoffix> (though I think I made such clames in the past)

[13:14] <scovit> I might end up helping you in stuff in the core, but just at some point and by chance

[13:14] *** mcmillhj joined
[13:15] <grondilu> Zoffix: Real

[13:15] <Zoffix> Well, not "at all". "Parts of rakudo are written in Rakudo, so it's easier to understand core code than were it written in an entirely different language" is the true statement :)

[13:15] <scovit> specifically, i was trying to make a custom proxy class

[13:15] <Zoffix> grondilu: but all Reals are Numeric

[13:15] <Zoffix> well, all core Real types are also Numeric 

[13:16] <Zoffix> And so they .Bridge to Num

[13:16] <grondilu> ok you meant Numeric not Num

[13:16] <Zoffix> No, I meant Num

[13:16] <grondilu> hum

[13:17] <grondilu> not all reals are Num, are they?

[13:17] <grondilu> m: my $x = 1; say $x ~~ Real; say $x ~~ Num;

[13:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ad51a: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§False‚ê§¬ª

[13:17] <Zoffix> No, only Num are Num

[13:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2ad51a: OUTPUT: ¬´Num‚ê§Num‚ê§Num‚ê§Nil‚ê§Num‚ê§¬ª

[13:18] <grondilu> that's because they use the default Bridge

[13:19] <grondilu> Real.Bridge must return a Real, but it doesn't have to be a Num.

[13:19] <Zoffix> It does. It bridges different types to one type (Num)

[13:20] * grondilu is skeptical

[13:20] <Zoffix> And all core types return Num from .Bridge (though, now I see Complex doesn't have it), so my original point was: why the roundabout, just use a .Num

[13:20] *** mcmillhj left
[13:20] *** mcmillhj joined
[13:20] <grondilu> I'm currently writing a Polynomial class.  I want it to implement Real.  So I'm writing a Bridge method and I intend it to return a Real, not a Num.  Am I doing it wrong?

[13:21] <Zoffix> grondilu: my bet would be you'd encounter more infinite loops like you did above. Some operator will be trying to .Bridge your Real into something it can work with and will loop forever in dispatch

[13:21] * grondilu suddenly realizes that can be circular

[13:22] <grondilu> yeah

[13:22] <grondilu> otherwise I could just write class :: does Real { method Bridge { self } }

[13:23] <masak> I've never quite understood Bridge either. I've never encountered the term "bridge" used in this way outside of Rakudo's core :)

[13:24] *** xtreak left
[13:25] <perlpilot> It's analogous to a network bridge, but with types instead of networks.  (at least that's how I accept the term in my own head :)

[13:27] *** Skarsnik__ is now known as Skarsnik

[13:27] <masak> yes, I _understand_ the term fine :)

[13:27] <grondilu> I can implement Real but apparently I can overwrite its Str method :/

[13:28] <masak> I was just never fully convinced that Rakudo's number tower needs a Bridge in the first place

[16:43] *** user123123 left
[16:44] <timo> have you tried mlterm? it has sixel support :)

[16:45] <skids> I may look it over but it gets really frustrating trying 10s of terms to find the one that has decent actual emulation and won't get screwed up by my various switches/vendor kit.

[16:45] <timo> yeah

[16:46] <skids> I actually got desparate enough to hack quick-select support into pterm just to call it a day.

[16:46] *** mr-foobar left
[16:47] <teatime> libvte is indeed cruminess.  I was happy with urxvt for a long time.  now I mostly just use xterm.

[16:47] <timo> what's quick-select again?

[16:47] <skids> The second cut and paste buffer in linux.

[16:47] <skids> (well X)

[16:47] <timo> ah

[16:47] <teatime> I need to figure out how to make ctrl+shift+pgup/pgdn scroll in tmux (or screen)

[16:47] <timo> i'm currently using mate-terminal, but it's got the worst crap for copy-paste

[16:48] <timo> where when you copy something it'll apparently only remember what part of the terminal you selected

[16:48] <timo> and when you paste it just takes whatever is at that spot at that very moment

[16:48] <skids> Ow.

[16:48] <teatime> lol, wow.  wtf?

[16:48] <timo> so good luck copy-pasting across like channels in weechat or something

[16:48] <stmuk> I quite like the smaller vte stuff like roxterm or sakura

[16:48] <timo> oh, on my desktop i actually use konsole

[17:25] <HoboWithAShotgun> can i have aliases in signatures? such as foo(alpha=>45) is the same as foo(Œ±=>1) ?

[17:26] <jnthn> :alias(:$name)

[17:29] <Zoffix> m: sub foo (:alpha(:$Œ±) = 45) { dd $Œ± }; foo :42alpha; foo :70Œ±; foo

[17:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 55aa7f: OUTPUT: ¬´Int $Œ± = 42‚ê§Int $Œ± = 70‚ê§Int $Œ± = 45‚ê§¬ª

[17:32] <timo> Zoffix: you mentioned you'd also find 3k acceptable, but i somehow ended up with 6k; does that still sound good?

[17:33] <Zoffix> timo: I'd need to more thoroughly read the proposal. What's the link again?

[17:33] <timo> https://docs.google.com/document/d/102h_Nlpq4ED-PpJVfy7kggp5LYmpORhsB3E1eeZ3yfI/edit#heading=h.b0iufphxvxhj

[17:33] <timo> i'll surely take at least 200 hours, hopefully not terribly much more

[17:33] <HoboWithAShotgun> allright. so using "multi sub prefix:<‚ñ≥>(List $list) returns Math::Triangle" I can now write say (‚ñ≥(Œ± => 75¬∞, c => 3, b => 3) ).beta; #prints 52.5¬∞ 

[17:34] <HoboWithAShotgun> I would like to get rid of the inner parens

[17:34] <HoboWithAShotgun> or maybe even the outer ones

[17:35] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: .beta.say with ‚ñ≥ Œ± => 75¬∞, c => 3, b => 3

[17:35] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: .beta.say with ‚ñ≥ Œ± => 75¬∞, :3c, :3b

[17:35] <Zoffix> :)

[17:36] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: oh, wait, it'd help if I read the actual code lol :P

[17:36] <HoboWithAShotgun> :3b? what kind of black magic is that again

[17:36] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: .beta.say with ‚ñ≥ "Œ±" => 75¬∞, "c" => 3, "b" => 3

[17:36] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: basically, without quotes there, it's getting passed as a named arg.

[17:37] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: :3b is the same as b => 3

[17:37] <skids> HoboWithAShotgun: It's for stuff like :3rd

[17:37] <Zoffix> You can use any non-negative integer there

[17:37] <Zoffix> huggable: colonpairs

[17:37] <huggable> Zoffix, All the shortcuts of colonpairs: https://twitter.com/zoffix/status/839807414211854337

[17:37] <Zoffix> HoboWithAShotgun: ^ lots of good stuff there

[17:39] <skids> Anyway probably you want a slurpy rather than List $list.  Which one depends on how you want to handle flattening.

[17:41] <HoboWithAShotgun> skids, i am just routing the arguments to the triangle operator to call the  Math::Triangle constructor

[17:42] <Zoffix> Oh yeah, you need a slurpy there too. And if you use a named arg slurpy, you won't need to deal with the quoting business

[17:43] <HoboWithAShotgun> i'm doing this multi sub prefix:<‚ñ≥>(List $list) returns Math::Triangle is export( :operators ) { return Math::Triangle.new( |%$list ); }

[17:43] <HoboWithAShotgun> works fine

[17:44] <HoboWithAShotgun> what benefit would i get from using a slurpy?

[18:15] <Zoffix> timo: basically, I've no idea what the work involved is gonna look like. If it costs 6G, it's fine. But right now to the reader who's not intimately familiar with the interals, it just reads like a wall of acronyms and buzz words, and all they walk away with is there'll be an optimizer program at the end of the 6G. If you'd describe the challenges and problems that need to be solved in more detail, I think

[18:15] <Zoffix> it'd help convince more people.

[19:52] <davidfetter> hi

[19:53] <davidfetter> i know it sounds insane, but i'm looking to embed perl6 in a C program (well, a PL for PostgreSQL)

[19:53] <davidfetter> is that a thing?

[19:54] <moritz> davidfetter: since Inline::Perl6 exists in Perl 5, I'm sure it's possible

[19:54] <davidfetter> https://docs.perl6.org/language/nativecall <-- kinda the opposite way 'round

[19:55] *** zakharyas left
[19:58] <timo> moritz: the thing is that Inline::Perl6 just replaces the perl5 process with a perl6 process that includes the rest of the program with Inline::Perl5 :)

[19:58] <davidfetter> somebody page Rube Goldberg

[19:59] <davidfetter> perhaps PL/npq might be a better plan

[21:56] <Altreus> what do I read to understand this? my @fact = [\*] 1..*;

[21:56] *** orac1e_ joined
[21:56] <Altreus> specifically this \* in the operator

[21:57] <timo> it's a triangle reduce rather than a regular reduce

[21:57] <timo> (because the [\ looks a bit like a triangle)

[22:03] <Altreus> oh interesting

[22:03] <timo> some languages call it "produce"

[22:13] <Altreus> I found the docs that explained it :)

[22:13] <Altreus> it was pretty obvious once I simply removed it :P

[22:16] <timo> it'd be nice if [\ would give you an entry immediately, but when you "use web search" you immediately get the right answer, too

[22:16] <timo> but it's got a big red background as if "you did something wrong"

[22:22] <timo> and it would probably be cool if reduce-[ ] and produce-[\ ] also showed up on the page for [ ]

[22:23] <timo> i think i'll open a doc issue
