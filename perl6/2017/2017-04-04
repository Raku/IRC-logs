[08:05] <daxim> samcv, I'm doing customised collation with perl5: <http://paste.debian.net/925841/>  you can translate it into a test case for your grant

[08:07] <samcv> daxim, what is your planned supporting of codepoint that have multiple arrays?

[08:07] <samcv> err multiple collation arrays

[08:08] <samcv> and series of codeponits that have one or more arrays that are distinct from when the codepoints appear individually or next to other characters?

[08:08] <daxim> it appears I don't have those

[08:08] <samcv> kk

[08:08] <samcv> my moarvm collation does not have those yet eater

[08:08] <samcv> eather

[08:09] *** mcmillhj left
[08:09] <samcv> you can read about the collation functions of perl 6 here https://docs.perl6.org/language/experimental#Collation

[08:09] <samcv> currently rethinking the collation levels interface, because i want you to be able to reverse things

[08:09] <daxim> nice, the foundation is laid

[08:09] <samcv> so capital letters before lowercase would be the most common example i can think of

[08:09] <samcv> yep :)

[08:11] *** mr-foobar left
[08:12] *** mr-foobar joined
[08:13] <eater> samcv: ?

[08:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 067208: OUTPUT: «(a A b B)␤»

[08:22] <samcv> atm can only turn on or off the collation levels. so will hopefully be do that as part of the grant too

[08:22] <samcv> hi eater 

[08:23] *** mr-foobar joined
[08:26] <eater> samcv: y u mention me

[08:26] <samcv> you said my name

[08:27] <moritz> now you can start talking :-)

[08:37] *** movl joined
[08:43] <samcv> daxim, i added a COLLATION_QC property for codepoints that are starters or have multiple collation element arrays so i could run it against the unicode collation test txt files

[08:44] <samcv> have you done anything similar to check, not sure how your implementation is, that could be a pain. though you could always use perl 6 to process the collation list and then feed in to perl 5 and see how your collation algorithm is doing

[08:45] <El_Che> samcv: good luck with the grant

[08:45] <samcv> thanks El_Che :)

[08:46] <samcv> daxim, this the file i tested our collation with https://github.com/samcv/UCD/blob/master/CollationTest.t#L42

[08:49] <daxim> in my code, I'm just adding three new letters, and then the collation module knows how to treat them for the ->index method.  what you linked to looks like a different purpose or goal

[08:50] <samcv> that code just tests perl 6 code against the unicode collation test files in CollationTests from the zip here ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest

[08:50] <samcv> if you want me to write you a script that just filters out all the 'tricky' lines in the file i will do so

[08:50] *** Cabanossi left
[08:51] <samcv> would make it easy for you to test your collation on the unicode tests without getting failures from all these weird things

[08:51] <samcv> like 'ﬆ' sorting with 'st'

[08:51] <daxim> no, I showed you the perl5 code because I hoped with the result of your work I can do the same in perl6

[08:51] *** mcmillhj joined
[08:52] <samcv> oh sorry i thought you were the one who made the Unicode sort module in perl 5

[08:52] <samcv> maybe i misunderstood.

[13:26] <Skarsnik> Hello Zoffix :) IO::Path is an IO::Handle too?

[13:27] <Skarsnik> the XML module use IO to handle these 2 types

[13:27] <Zoffix> :S

[13:27] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: they're vastly different types :/

[13:27] <Zoffix> And no, it isn't an IO::handle

[13:28] <Skarsnik> https://github.com/supernovus/exemel/blob/master/lib/XML.pm6#L35

[13:29] <Skarsnik> nvm IO::handle probably work as open method is used on the IO::Path

[13:29] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: yes, IO::Path.open returns an IO::Handle.

[13:30] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: and this is an error, as it [used to] accept IO::Path and IO::Socket* types, none of which have a .slurp-rest method: https://github.com/supernovus/exemel/blob/master/lib/XML.pm6#L12

[13:35] <Skarsnik> it's me or the language did not grow much on popularity/use? I did not get some tickets on my modules. I was expecting to get some on like Discord/Gumbo x)

[13:35] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: for which period?

[13:35] <Skarsnik> a year?

[13:36] <Skarsnik> I haven't much contributed since a while.

[13:38] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: language definitely grew. New faces on IRC. 4 or 5 new books being published (some finished!). People outside the community no longer go "lulzwat Perl is dead" and mostly know Perl 6 is a new language. However, I did notice ecosystem growth slowed down quite a bit, which I suspect has a lot to do with Inline::Perl5 and Inline::Python being improved greatly. There's little reason for people to write

[13:38] <Zoffix> new modules, when they can just use Perl 5's or Python's well-tested gems

[13:38] <Zoffix> And I remembered what the web stats URL was, I'd even say by how much usage grew :)

[13:38] <Zoffix> *and if I rememberd

[14:09] <raschipi> Zoffix has a bot that bridges this channel and his twitter, so he pops in when he wants to help.

[14:10] <Skarsnik> lol

[14:11] <Skarsnik> I could try on my 64 bits VPS 

[14:14] *** Zoffix joined
[14:15] <Zoffix> raschipi: no, the bot only bridges messages that include my name. And I backlog the channel only if I get bored.

[14:15] <Skarsnik> Maybe it's a bug in gumbo parser (the c lib), I did not update the lib

[14:16] <raschipi> Right. I'll keep that in mind.

[14:16] <Zoffix> So if there's some IO breakage that's not answered by the two upgrade notices, direct people to #perl6-dev as I don't monitor this channel 24/7. 

[14:17] *** bbkr joined
[14:17] <Zoffix> The notices being http://rakudo.org/2017/04/03/part-2-upgrade-information-for-changes-due-to-io-grant-work/ and  http://rakudo.org/2017/04/02/upgrade-information-for-changes-due-to-io-grant-work/

[14:18] <maasta> hi everyone! quick question, is there an easy way to XOR two hexstring? 

[14:19] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: I will write one. The first naive attempt to use `zef smoke` took ages and I killed it midway

[14:19] <moritz> m: say (:16<DEAD> +^ :16<BEEF>).base(16) # for maasta

[14:19] <moritz> like that?

[14:20] <maasta> yes, did not think to do it like that

[14:20] <maasta> thanks moritz

[18:49] <beginner> hi

[18:49] <raschipi> hello

[18:49] *** eroux joined
[18:49] <beginner> is there a way to suspend the current process and start another process in perl6

[18:53] <raschipi> You want to execute something else and wait for it to finish?

[18:53] <beginner> want to execute something

[18:55] <raschipi> "run" https://docs.perl6.org/routine/run Executes something and waits for it to finish.

[18:58] <beginner> i guess this will help...thanks...my scenario is i want to check a variable value(n = 5)...if it is not true then i want to suspend this process and do some other asynchronous call...and then after the asynchronous call is complete i want to come back and check the variable again(n =5 )

[18:58] <beginner> any ideas for this?

[19:00] *** labster joined
[19:03] <perlpilot> beginner: I don't know about the "suspend this process" part, but calling something asynchronously doesn't seem too bad.

[19:05] *** tokomer left
[19:06] <beginner> if we take an producer consumer problem...instead of making it sleep i want it do some other process

[19:08] <raschipi> When the process blocks, you want to do something else? You should just launch two threads and let the kernel sort it out.

[19:10] <vendethiel> https://twitter.com/zoffix/status/847234269227253760 zoffix: this is the first instance I actually thought "hey, R=> would be useful here" :). nice snippets as always

[19:11] *** sufrostico left
[19:12] <Zoffix> vendethiel: I don't get how R=> helps there. Unless you linked to the wrong tweet?

[19:12] <vendethiel> well, `$text R=> do with`, I mean.

[19:12] <vendethiel> (it took me some time to understand you mixed a postfix with with a do'ed statement with)

[19:13] <Zoffix> m: my $n = 4; unless $n == 5 { $n = await start { sleep 2; 5 }; if $n == 5 { say "all good now" } }

[19:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 87fe80: OUTPUT: «all good now␤»

[19:13] <Zoffix> beginner: ^ that does what you described.

[19:14] <Zoffix> beginner: you can pop it into its own start {} and not care about `await` blocking this part of code. There are also Supplies

[19:14] <Zoffix> huggable: Supplier

[19:14] <huggable> Zoffix, Live: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Supplier

[19:14] <Zoffix> vendethiel: oh! right :) Then I have two uses of R=> now :)

[19:14] <vendethiel> \o/

[19:15] <Zoffix> vendethiel: well, I guess just one, since it's the same usecase: https://twitter.com/zoffix/status/846449596649877504

[19:15] <Zoffix> And that tweet is from earlier time, so I forgot my discovery doh :P

[19:16] <vendethiel> XR=>, huh? What a mess it would be if we had to pronounce those ;-) *winks at Haskell lenses*
