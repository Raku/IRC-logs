[08:17] <yoleaux> 03:11Z <Zoffix> lizmat: any idea why this gives only `"\n"` in the list instead of both `"\n"` and `"\r\n"`? Bisectbot points to the `is default` change in IO::Handle. I'm failing to golf it out of IO::Handle tho even after copying all the relevant bits. Code:  class Z is IO::Handle { method x { dd $.nl-in } }.new.x;

[14:16] <Zoffix> Can't even spread a function call onto multiple lines on this thing without putting ' _' as unspace on each line

[14:16] <moritz> though I can kinda imagine that GUI automation is unfun in any language

[14:17] <Zoffix> It's pretty neat in this language, I'd say. It's the lang itself that kinda eww. If I had Rakudo's features, it'd be pretty sweet. I think there's a C lib that comes with AutoIt. Might write bindings for it.

[14:18] <RockyBalboa> Hello! Just a quick question. I have played with Perl 6 the past few days. I LOVE the language: the synthax, all the features, it's so good. I would love to switch to Perl 6 (coming from Ruby), but right now Perl 6 is sadly too slow (for a web app for example). I was wondering, where are now? When can we expect to have better performances? I would love to help, but I am just a web developer. Anyway, thanks for your work guys. :)

[14:19] <moritz> RockyBalboa: Rakudo (the compiler) has been getting faster steadily over the last few years

[14:19] <Zoffix> RockyBalboa: couple days ago we added new spesh that made our bench run 20% faster. And more work is being done. You can help sponsor the person most capable of performing the needed work: https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/05/12/looking-for-perl-6-rakudo-and-moarvm-development-funding/

[14:24] <RockyBalboa> For example, just parsing a string variable seems somehow slow compared to Ruby. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be rude, I know you are working hard :)

[14:24] <moritz> RockyBalboa: what do you mean by "parsing"? matching a regex against it?

[14:25] <timotimo> rakudo has a few "performance cliffs" in my experience; there's ways to do things that are definitely fast enough, but you can easily shoot your performance to hell with just a simple change or two

[14:26] <RockyBalboa> For example, if I declare: my $string = 'long long string' and simply run this perl file, it's kind of slow (compared to other scripting languages).

[14:26] <moritz> oh, that's mostly startup time

[14:27] <RockyBalboa> Oh ok, startup/compile time?

[14:27] <moritz> and yes, last I measured, rakudo was around 100ms, and ruby around 40ms

[14:27] *** nadim joined
[14:27] <raschipi> TimToady is working on making that faster, isn't he?

[14:28] <Zoffix> RockyBalboa: nothing rude in that :) Ruby first release 22 years ago, we first released less than 2 years ago :) Ruby had a much larger head start :)

[14:28] <Zoffix> Last I heard TimToady was raking in huge amounts of air miles traveling :)

[14:28] *** st_elmo joined
[14:28] <Zoffix> But yeah, latest Cursor/Match stuff he worked on was to eventually make more optimizations in that area

[14:30] <Zoffix> RockyBalboa: what rakudo version are you on BTW? perl6 -v

[14:30] <RockyBalboa> Zoffix: Ok nice! Yes, I imagine it's a huuuge task! Ruby was very slow too a few years ago

[14:31] <RockyBalboa> I was on rakudo-star-2017.07

[14:31] <Zoffix> Ah. Good. That's the latest.

[14:32] <RockyBalboa> In a web app, we need to do a lot of html template parsing and every ms count

[14:33] <timotimo> you only need to parse html templates once, then a piece of code is generated for you that only does some string concatenation and loops and such

[14:33] <RockyBalboa> But still, Perl 6 synthax is a magnificient! I love all these features. :)

[14:34] <RockyBalboa> Yes timotimo, I should do that. Ruby is fast enough I didn't even cache generated code, I just eval it on the fly

[14:35] <timotimo> there's multiple benefits to not generating the code new every time you use the template

[14:35] <timotimo> the dynamic optimizer starts investigating code after it's been run a few times

[14:35] <timotimo> if you only run it once, then toss it, that's not going to help terribly much :)

[14:36] <RockyBalboa> Ok thanks! Yes, I am maybe too used to 100% interpreted language (and Perl is compiled...)

[14:36] <mspo> 100% interpreted?

[14:38] <timotimo> there aren't many of those around any more

[14:45] <moritz> RockyBalboa: in Perl 6, we try to encode the unit of the result in the method name

[14:46] <moritz> RockyBalboa: .size -- could be size in bytes

[14:46] <moritz> RockyBalboa: likewise, string lenghts are measured in .chars and .codes (and .bytes on buffers), there is no .length

[14:47] <geekosaur> people like to think strings are simple, but they are anything but and pretending leads to e.g. web pages containing Âœ style gobbledygook

[14:48] <RockyBalboa> Ok thx, it makes sense :) 

[14:49] <RockyBalboa> In Ruby, we can make string.chars (returns an array of chars) and chain with string.chars.size, but it's not efficient, so there is string.size as a shorthand

[14:50] <raschipi> .comb.elems does the same thing in Perl6 as .chars

[14:51] <ugexe> it probably returns the same result, but does it really do the same thing?

[14:51] <raschipi> m: "Hello World!".comb.say

[14:52] *** andrzejku joined
[14:52] <geekosaur> I thinkt hat is only true if all your "characters" are < 0x80

[14:52] <RockyBalboa> Ok nice! In the end, it's just about embrassing the change, and not trying to do Ruby in Perl :)

[14:52] <geekosaur> but poeeple like to pretend that's the world of characters

[14:53] <raschipi> I think I got confused in my anser, .comb.elems does the same thing in Perl6 as .chars.size in Ruby.

[14:53] <raschipi> Or does it?

[14:55] <RockyBalboa> But what I was really saying is that "elems" feels like I will get an array or a collection of elements back, not an integer :)

[14:55] <geekosaur> the real problem is, what is a character? how many characters in Æ̈̊ ?

[14:55] <RockyBalboa> But it's a minor thing yes :)

[14:55] <RockyBalboa> A character = a unicode character?

[14:56] <raschipi> RockyBalboa: Yes a "grapheme cluster".

[14:56] *** rurban joined
[14:57] <timotimo> it could very well be that when you comb a string and ask for the .elems that it'll use count-only to not have to create an array of characters

[14:57] *** Guest12799 left
[14:58] <andreoss> is it possible to specify varience for parametric role?

[14:59] *** robertle left
[14:59] <moritz> we do

[14:59] <timotimo> is that perhaps what andreoss is asking for?

[15:00] <andreoss> role Container[::A] { has A $.v }; class Foo {}; class Bar is Foo {}; Container[Foo] is a super class of Container[Bar]

[15:01] <timotimo> ah, now i get it

[15:01] <timotimo> i.e. do we smartmatch (for example) the parameters when we smartmatch roles

[15:04] <andreoss> m: role Container[::A] { has A $.v }; class Foo {}; class Bar is Foo {}; say Container[Foo] ~~ Container[Bar]

[15:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 674551: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[15:05] <timotimo> looks like we don't

[15:21] <jnthn> andreoss: Classes are open (can be augmented) would be one notable problem, but in general roles are units of re-use and classes are units of instance management.

[18:30] <sena_kun> arnsholt, hi! I am interested in Net::ZMQ a bit and sent a PR today, but it brings some changes and I think it needs to be reviewed. If you are still interested in this project, I will be very grateful for any help from you.

[18:56] <ugexe> since it was fixed in .10, it might be that your zef version doesn't have the fix where it was doing numerical comparison

[19:05] <[Coke]> (xt vs. t) - perl6/docs also needs this separation.

[19:06] <ugexe> nadim: maybe need to `zef nuke site home` if the module with that code is already installed (so it can be reinstalled)

[19:06] <ugexe> that will delete all installed modules

[19:08] <nadim> ohhh noooo!

[19:08] <nadim> can I get a list that I can give back to zef to reinstall all?

[19:34] <Zoffix> No, that's for unpacking

[19:34] <smls> ok

[19:34] <nadim> Meh! now that works and I have updated the repo ... I have nothing to do

[19:34] <Zoffix> | calls a secret method

[19:35] <jnthn> smls: No

[19:35] <jnthn> Shh, it's secret!!!

[19:35] <smls> I'm not using   f |%(...)  because one of the named argument values is an Array, and the  %(...)  creates a Hash which itemizes the Array, and that messes up the assignment to the object attribute.

[19:35] <Zoffix> :D

[19:35] <Zoffix> Yeah, they're secret methods. Don't use them directly

[19:45] * Zoffix doesn't see what a JS piece of code with an error in it has to do with UNIX or the love of it :P

[19:48] * Zoffix will fix in 1hr, unless someone beats to it

[20:05] <Zoffix> Blow it up and rewrite it and make it generate an SQLite db instead of HTML. Then have a mojo web app serve from that db. Solve all the problems with URLs, improve search, and shorten build times

[20:05] <Zoffix> ???

[20:05] <Zoffix> Profit!

[20:06] <Zoffix> and have a bot use the docs from the API

[20:06] <Zoffix> and have p6doc just use the DB

[20:10] *** andrzejku left
[20:10] <Zoffix> p6doc would just use a locally stored db, if that's what you meant

[20:16] <Zoffix> good, even

[20:16] <jdv79> you seem to be building up modules.perl6.org and i haven't heard of any clamoring for metacpan6 so...

[20:20] <Zoffix> wow :) that's a lot 

[20:20] <Zoffix> cool

[20:33] <Zoffix> the `is default` stuff is suspicious too. I think dogbert is now having socket bug that looks similar that I had with handle before is default was reverted from it

[20:33] <Zoffix> or rather, I think it's hitting somw other bug

[20:34] <Zoffix> buggable: toast

[20:34] <buggable> Zoffix, Between 2017.06-241-gb3f679b and 2017.06: 13 (1.56%) modules got burnt; 14 (1.68%) got unsucced; 203 (24.37%) out of 833 modules appear unusable. See https://toast.perl6.party/ for details.

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> that's a bit outdated, no?

[20:36] <Zoffix> yup

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: are you planning to rerun this stuff this month?

[20:36] <AlexDaniel> or, this week rather :P

[22:01] <MasterDuke> i think i saw that jnthn++ fixed a leak today or yesterday, but i don't believe it's the one we're seeing

[22:02] <MasterDuke> figuring out what's going on is difficult, because one of the recent changes increases memory churn a lot

[22:03] <MasterDuke> which makes some numbers look much much bigger than before, but aren't necessarily indicative of a leak or truly increased consumption

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: can you submit a ticket or should I do it? I find it hard to track the status otherwise

[22:04] *** zengargoyle joined
[22:04] <timotimo> MasterDuke: i don't properly recall, did we try reverting that one commit that turned memset into free + calloc

[22:04] <timotimo> ?

[22:04] <MasterDuke> i can't do it for a while, about to afk for a bit

[22:04] <MasterDuke> timotimo: don't think so

[22:06] <El_Che> lizmat: how was the pre-social? I went to dinner and it was to late to make it

[22:06] <lizmat> well, it wssn't on the roof because of the rain / wetness after the rain

[22:06] <lizmat> it was a nice gathering  :-)

[22:07] <lizmat> people had to be thrown out at 22:30  :-)

[22:07] <El_Che> lots of people?

[22:07] <lizmat> I would say about 100

[22:07] <El_Che> we considerirng walking to the venue at 23h, but we reckon that 23:30 would be too late

[22:08] <MasterDuke> timotimo: think just that commit can be reverted?

[22:08] <El_Che> are you having breakfast in the hotel tomorrow morning?

[22:10] <timotimo> MasterDuke: i think so

[22:38] <ugexe> but maybe thats only for extraction

[22:38] <El_Che> mmm

[22:39] <El_Che> I wanted a way to tar modules directories to package dependencies. Dependency on perl 5 would be difficult on windows

[22:50] <timotimo> the line in collect.c is what does the calloc for the nursery

[22:50] <jnthn> El_Che: I used https://github.com/frithnanth/perl6-Archive-Libarchive in an app on both Windows and Linux.

[22:51] <jnthn> El_Che: To produce tarballs

[22:51] <jnthn> And extract them

[22:51] <jnthn> It's set up on Windows to automatically download the DLLs

[22:52] <jnthn> So they ship and work if made into an installer with https://github.com/jnthn/p6-app-installermaker-wix

[22:55] <El_Che> jnthn: thx, I will look into it. I was thinking on a way to bundle all perl6 only deps so an app can be packages. Was reading stuff to understand if it's better to create a versioned pkg to be unpackaged and run, or to do something like Fatpacker on perl5

[22:55] <El_Che> that's why I would prefer no C deps so it's really portable
