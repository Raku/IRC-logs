[02:59] <thou> tbrowder, my name is Tim Smith, being generic enough that it's nearly always taken anywhere I want to sign up for something. :-)

[02:59] <tbrowder> thou: that grammar looks interesting but i don’t see how tables with whitespace column separators can be defined.

[03:00] <geekosaur> at least they didn't manage to bowdlerize you :p

[03:00] <thou> Could be, I didn't dig into it.

[03:02] <tbrowder> they rely on aligned columns over the set of rows that, imho, requires the complete set to analyse, and tables with visual column separators don’t mix with the other table type.

[03:03] <thou> tbrowder, the untwine patch isn't all that large, but I've done very little rakudo hacking so may have just a bit of a curve before I can try it. Given that it's a few years old, I'm not sure the original author is active anymore? Is LLFourn around, looks not based on http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log_search/perl6?search=LLfour&action=search&timespan=&nick=checked

[12:37] <DrForr> Not yet that I'm aware of, but I'm terribly excited by the fact that we have people deploying code live that we might be able to actually *talk* about instead of make vague statements about :)

[12:37] <mahafyi> DrFprr, lol. 

[12:38] <mahafyi> DrForr , typo 

[12:40] <DrForr> Oh. If you mean perl5 there are plenty of consultants out there, no real "Perl5 Inc." office though.

[12:41] <mahafyi> well, I really meant I'd like to talk to folks in here to help me build many things (I originally was here on a borrowed nickname, kannan, and I havent yet gotten around to learning much perl6) but I am contrarian enough to risk it

[12:42] *** piojo_ joined
[12:42] <DrForr> Aha.

[12:42] <DrForr> Most of us are already building stuff but happy to lend a hand, got a project in mind?

[12:42] <mahafyi> for the record I fully intend to learn perl6 .. but i also want to pay for it when I use it

[12:43] <mahafyi> yes, I would like to bootstrap a startup, providing cloud telephony, as well as I have a highly specialized area for a particular product

[12:43] <DrForr> Pay as in money? You can always contribute to the Perl6 development fund...

[12:44] <mahafyi> DrForr, yes I surely will, but I'd like to have someone to actually help me build things.

[12:45] <mahafyi> so far the only money i spent has been on  Learning Perl 6 Fundamentals, :)

[13:05] <moritz> _ramix_: the schedule is at https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/perl6advent-2017/schedule and already quite full

[13:05] <moritz> _ramix_: but, there are still options

[13:05] <moritz> you could write a post for the 25th

[13:05] <moritz> or you could write a post, and hope that somebody doesn't write theirs in time, and we can swap it in

[13:05] <moritz> or somebody could give up their spot

[13:06] <DrForr> (the latter has happened before, I know, I've done it :) (though my issue was network related more than anything.)

[13:06] <_ramix_> ook, thanks!

[13:06] *** mahafyi joined
[13:07] <moritz> _ramix_: what do you want to write about?

[13:07] <moritz> [Coke] hasn't announced a topic yet, so he might be a candidate for giving up a spot

[13:07] <mahafyi> and I am back. Whenever one attempts to great good to the world (like build a new company with perl6) one faces many hurdles (like a power outage)

[13:08] <_ramix_> A post about HTTP and Concurrency  (IO::Sockets:Async)

[13:08] <moritz> _ramix_: nice :-)

[13:08] <DrForr> Also a certain moritz has two posts there :) Not that I'm encouraging anyone to stop writing :)

[13:08] <_ramix_> this is the post: https://ramiroencinascom.wordpress.com/2017/12/07/concurrent-http-perl6-implementation-and-the-scripts-point-of-view/

[13:09] <moritz> DrForr: yes, but I already wrote both, so I'm loath to throw one away :-)

[13:09] <DrForr> Dude. You know what they say: Write one to throw away :)

[15:21] <comborico1611> Does anyone know the difference between multiprogramming and time sharing?  I've done a search on it and I'm still confused.  The best answer I have is time sharing allows multiprogramming to be done in equal shares based on time limit.

[15:24] *** mscha joined
[15:24] <mscha> How do you specify that a sub returns a list of integers?

[15:24] <mscha> m: sub foo returns List { 1,2,3 }; say foo;

[15:24] <camelia> rakudo-moar f70e20bdf: OUTPUT: «(1 2 3)␤»

[15:25] <mscha> This works, but can I specify "of integers"?

[15:26] <tbrowder> my 8 dec post is available for critique on wordpress--i would appreciate some other eyes on it (thnx to perlpilot for an earlier review). note that Zoffix's new highlighter still throws an exception so i'm using  last year's version.

[15:28] <perlpilot> comborico1611: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing  :-)

[15:29] <perlpilot> mscha: why do you want "List of Int"?

[15:31] <moritz> comborico1611: with multiple cores, you can have multiple programs run in parallel without time sharing

[15:31] <perlpilot> mscha: you can probably do something like:  subset ListOfInt of List where { all(@($_)) ~~ Int }; sub foo returns ListOfInt { 1, 2, 3 }

[15:31] <moritz> comborico1611: or phrased differently, time sharing is an implementation of multiprogramming, but not the only one

[15:33] *** mienaikage joined

[15:38] <sjn> m: subset ListOfInt of List where .all ~~ Int; sub foo (--> ListOfInt) { 1, 2, 3.14 }; say foo();

[15:39] * perlpilot forgets that all/any/one/none are methods apparently

[15:41] <sjn> is it possible to add a custom error message to the subset?

[18:23] <poohman> hello all - a quick question - in regex, how to negate a literal? !'>' or ^'>' or -'>'

[18:24] <TimToady> <!before '>'>

[18:25] <TimToady> note that it doesn't advance the cursor

[18:26] *** abraxxa joined
[18:26] <poohman> thanks anyway to advance cursor as well, if  am not asking too much

[18:26] *** kyan joined
[18:27] <TimToady> well, how much? one character?  the length of the literal?

[18:27] <TimToady> just put a . to advance one char

[18:27] *** mahafyi_ joined
[18:27] <kyan> Hi! So I had a big .p6 file, and now I cut out part of it and pasted it into another file. How can I make the first file import it?

[18:28] <TimToady> but if you're doing a single char, then <-[ > ]> will do that already

[18:29] *** mahafyi left
[18:29] <poohman> {!before'<'.}*

[18:29] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:29] *** mahafyi_ is now known as mahafyi

[18:29] <kyan> I tried putting "unit module EmParser;" at the beginning of the files, but it can't seem to find the class declared in other file.

[18:29] <poohman> will that work?

[18:30] <TimToady> no, you can't just change <> to {} like that

[18:30] <TimToady> <-[<]>* will do that though

[18:31] <poohman> great thanks - grinning wide - learning from Larry himself

[18:31] <TimToady> kyan: you wanna use 'use' to pull in the other file

[18:32] <TimToady> if your subfile is declaring a class, you probably want 'unit class' or so

[18:35] <kyan> Um, what do I put after "use"? I tried "use parserSupport.p6", "use parserSupport", and "use EmParser" (EmParser being what I put in "unit module EmParser;")

[18:35] *** mienaikage joined
[18:36] <geekosaur> kyan, if it's in the current directory, run perl6 with -I. or put "use lib '.';" in the using module

[18:36] <kyan> (they're all saying things like "Could not find parserSupport at line 9 in:")

[18:36] <TimToady>  you probably need some kind a 'use lib ".";" declaration or so, depending on where

[18:36] <TimToady> what geekosaur said

[18:36] <geekosaur> otherwise it looks in the module path, which does *not* contain the current directory by default

[18:37] <geekosaur> (current directory is kinda a bad default for that because now paths depend on where you ran the script from: it'll only work if you run it from where it is, not if you are somewhere else and reach it with a pathname)

[18:38] <geekosaur> ...and if you change it to mean that, now you can't refer to the *other* version

[18:39] *** darutoko left
[18:39] <geekosaur> this is fine in C because once it's compiled it no longer matters. for perl (or python or ...) it's always going to be a bit ambiguous

[18:40] <kyan> Hm, it still can't find it. Here's what I have at the moment: https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-information-technology-environment/tree/master/implementations/p6

[18:40] <kyan> I'm running ./parser.p6 from Bash.

[18:42] <DrForr> parserSupport has a package named SymbolTable, I'd recommend changing parserSupport to SymbolTable.pm6 an 'use SymbolTable;'.

[18:43] *** domidumont joined
[18:44] <kyan> Aha! It worked!

[18:44] <DrForr> You might also want to go to modules.perl6.org, choose a module name and look at how it's laid out.

[18:45] <kyan> When I run ./tests.p6, though, it says 'use lib' may not be pre-compiled (since it tries to import parser)...

[18:46] <kyan> Yeah, I tried using https://github.com/zostay/p6-DOM-Tiny/blob/master/lib/DOM/Tiny.pm6 as a model but couldn't make head nor tail of it

[18:46] *** domidumont1 left
[18:47] <comborico1611> tbrowder, glad you found your article!  I write my stuff on my local machine for that reason.

[18:47] *** domidumont left
[18:48] *** domidumont joined
[18:49] <DrForr> kyan: Same basic issue. grammar EM {}, so you probably should rename parser.pm6 to EM.p6 and then the same 'use lib...; use EM;'.

[18:49] *** mahafyi left
[18:50] <kyan> DrForr: EM.p6 or EM.pm6? The former says it couldn't find EM; the latter says use lib may not be precompiled

[18:51] <kyan> ooh I have an idea

[18:52] <DrForr> The latter, but don't let me tell you hat to do :)

[18:53] <kyan> (just wondered since the SymbolTable got .pm6)

[18:55] <kyan> I tried getting rid of all the use lib; and use whatever; outside of the tests.p6 (now runTests.p6) file I'm running, and putting them all in it

[18:55] *** cdg_ left
[18:56] *** cdg joined
[18:57] <kyan> That seemed to make the "use lib may not be pre-compiled" issue go away, but it still bombs out with "Could not find EM" despite EM.p6 existing

[19:00] <DrForr> Your files are kind of combinations of scripts and a more usual class, I'd try to separate those two.

[19:00] <kyan> Separate them in what way?

[19:01] *** cdg left
[19:01] *** Slayerk joined
[19:01] *** AlexDaniel joined
[19:01] <Slayerk> Hello p/

[19:01] <kyan> SymbolTable is a class, EM is a grammar, testSupport is a collection of subs, and runTests is a script...

[19:02] <Slayerk> Does $a %% $n[^20].any check if the number $a is divisible by any number from 1 to 20 in the list $n?

[19:02] <DrForr> Line 3 of EM.pm6 has code that creates a symbol table and *then* declares the grammar.

[19:02] <DrForr> You can still initialize the symbol table, but I'd do that in a separate file, and include the grammar.

[19:03] <kyan> ok, so have a file that's like, my $*ST = SymbolTable.new; use EM;

[19:04] <kyan> something feels weird about that

[19:04] <DrForr> Yeah. It might seem redundant, but you can reuse the grammar with a different symbol table.

[19:04] <kyan> oh, true

[19:06] <DrForr> And once it's up on CPAN someone else can reuse your grammar.

[19:06] <kyan> Hmm, it's back again with the Could not find grammarPrep thing...

[19:07] <kyan> DrForr: I mean I guess, I wasn't planning on posting it (I'm kind of learning while writing this, so it probably sucks / is of limited utility...)

[19:07] <DrForr> grammarPrep doesn't have a class in it, so there's nothing to "include".

[19:07] <kyan> DrForr: um...

[19:08] <timotimo> "use blah" doesn't automatically re-export stuff

[19:08] <yoleaux> 6 Dec 2017 23:10Z <tbrowder> timotimo: the old advent md2html from Zoffix seems to do fine.

[19:08] <DrForr> Don't think of 'use' as a C #include directive, think of it as a Python import of a class.

[19:09] <kyan> Ok, yeah, that's probably my problem, I don't "get" how Python does it either :P

[19:09] * kyan understands Bash and to some extent C and PHP. Not much of a programmer.

[19:10] <DrForr> You're loading a class definition, not inlining a file.

[19:10] <kyan> my small bits of Python have been thoroughly trial-and-error (mostly error)

[19:10] <DrForr> (really you are under the hood, but it's better to know the "proper" way to use it before abusing it :)

[19:11] <kyan> I guess "use" isn't necessarily what I want to use? I'm kinda confused, sorry...

[19:11] <DrForr> No, you're just thinking about it differently.

[19:11] *** setty1 joined
[19:12] <kyan> if it's just loading classes tho, how do I import stuff that's not classes?

[19:12] *** domidumont left
[19:12] <kyan> I don't just want to copy-paste my code everywhere, that always ends badly...

[19:12] *** domidumont joined
[19:12] <DrForr> Put it in a class and use the 'is export' declaration.

[19:13] <kyan> wait, put the "my $*ST = SymbolTable.new;" thing in a class, you mean?

[19:13] <DrForr> No, put that in a script thhat does 'use SymbolTable; my $*ST = SymbolTable.new;'

[19:14] *** ChoHag_ left
[19:14] *** domidumont1 joined
[19:14] <kyan> DrForr: Ok, but then how do I include *that* script?

[19:14] <DrForr> Single driver script that imports your classes.

[19:14] <timotimo> dynamic variables like $*ST are only available in things you call from the place it's declared, and a module that only declares a dynamic variable and calls nothing won't do much for you

[19:15] <kyan> Initializing the SymbolTable and importing the grammar are kind of a single step from the perspective of the test runner. Is there a way to stick the symboltable initializer into the grammar's constructor?

[19:16] *** raschipi joined
[19:17] * kyan reads the docs and thinks maybe knows how to do that

[19:17] <DrForr> I think you need to check out the :actions() adverb on the parser.

[19:17] *** domidumont left
[19:18] <DrForr> http://theperlfisher.blogspot.cz/2016/02/from-regular-expressions-to-grammars-pt_28.html # look for 'Taking Action.'

[19:19] <kyan> Thanks!

[19:19] <DrForr> You can make code run when an identifier is parsed without playing with the constructor.

[19:20] <kyan> "when an identifier is parsed" — by identifier, do you mean whatever I stick in the parens in EM.parse()?

[19:20] <DrForr> Yep.

[19:20] <kyan> Cool, thanks!

[19:20] <DrForr> (I think, will look.)

[19:20] *** poohman left
[19:20] *** poohman joined
[19:21] *** poohman left
[19:21] <DrForr> A method would run whenever the 'identifier' token is parsed, and it gets what's atched at that point.

[19:22] <DrForr> method identifier($/) { %.table{$/<escapedName>} = $/<parameterList>; }

[19:22] <DrForr> (full disclosure - I'm the author of said article.)

[19:37] <DrForr> You probably shouldn't be using the dynamic variable there.

[19:38] <DrForr> And $/ is already a matched object, so you're probably doing things too early.

[19:38] <kyan> Oh... I'm totally lost, sorry :P

[19:38] <moritz> kyan: show some code, maybe?

[19:38] <moritz> I might have missed some context

[19:39] <DrForr> https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-information-technology-environment/blob/master/implementations/p6/testSupport.p6

[19:39] <kyan> Five files right now: https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-information-technology-environment/tree/master/implementations/p6

[19:39] <kyan> I started with a single big script that did everything, and i'm having trouble breaking it up into separate files

[19:40] <kyan> the entry point is ./runTests.p6

[19:40] <Slayerk> Yeah

[19:40] <Slayerk> raschipi: Yeah

[19:40] <DrForr> kyan: It's also nice to be able to do 'is-deeply $parser.parse( Q{int i;} ), { identifier => { i => 'int' } };'.

[19:41] <raschipi> Slayerk: so, what's the problem?

[19:42] <kyan> DrForr: Oh, I guess wrapping it in a new class breaks that...

[19:42] <kyan> that's awkward.

[19:43] <DrForr> I was just looking at your test suite, and it's really more complex than it needs to be, IMO.

[19:43] <Slayerk> raschipi: I have a loop, and an if statement inside of the loop to test if the numbers are divisible by any number from 2 to 21

[19:43] *** itaipu joined
[19:43] <Slayerk> raschipi: But it comes back as all numbers being divisible by 2 to 21, even though I am looping to 1 million

[19:44] <kyan> DrForr: That is very much on my to do list... trying to get this thing split up before I go back to working on it so it's less of a headache to scroll through and doesn't have a million levels of indentation

[19:44] <DrForr> kyan: Here's a small module that might be inspiration - https://github.com/drforr/perl6-Grammar-Common

[19:46] <kyan> inspiration for this specific refactoring problem, or for how grammars are put together in general?

[19:46] <DrForr> The latter.

[19:46] <kyan> cool, thanks! :D

[19:48] <[Coke]> m: say (^1000).grep(* %% any(2..21))

[19:48] <DrForr> It's a pluggable set of roles that do some simple parsing tasks, the test suite might especially be interesting.

[19:48] <kyan> yeah, i'm looking at the tests ;)

[19:48] <kyan> much more orderly than mine, heh

[19:49] <DrForr> It's a little bit unusual in that I've got a grammar in the test suite, but that's because I'm testing how a role integrates into its parent grammar.

[20:30] <kyan> Ok, yeah, this is way over my head... thanks all :)

[20:30] * kyan will make a bash script to build the desired script from the chunks and then run that

[20:30] <DrForr> Oof.

[20:31] <Slayerk> raschipi: Thanks, but it still seems to be happening with () instead of [] :P

[20:33] <timotimo> m: my @a; @a.push[99]

[20:33] <kyan> I mean, I know bash, so at least I have some semblance of understanding how it works ;P

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f70e20bdf: ( no output )

[20:33] <timotimo> i didn't know you could .push without arguments

[20:33] <timotimo> m: my @a; @a.push(); say @a

[20:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar f70e20bdf: OUTPUT: «[]␤»

[20:34] <Slayerk> raschipi: It works now!

[20:35] <Slayerk> raschipi: Thanks for all your help! :D

[20:40] <kyan> Ok, that worked. :) Thanks all. :)

[20:40] <kyan> sorry I couldn't understand the modules.

[20:41] <DrForr> No worries, it takes some time to get used to it.

[20:41] <kyan> :P

[20:42] <kyan> Ty again, and thanks for the reusable grammar bits package

[20:42] <kyan> ! :D

[20:42] <DrForr> Quite welcome.

[21:04] <Marlik> Hi guys, I can not put Rakudo, I have Ubuntu 16.04, I use the manual https://perl6.org/downloads/

[21:05] <DrForr> What did you try, and what happened?

[21:08] *** geospeck left
[21:10] <moritz> Marlik: I recommend https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg

[21:11] <Marlik> I have no path to perl6, cd /home/marlik/opt and on manual do it. 

[21:13] <moritz> Marlik: I can't parse what you write

[21:14] <Marlik> moritz: Sorry, i check your link.

[21:14] <Marlik> moritz: Thanks.
