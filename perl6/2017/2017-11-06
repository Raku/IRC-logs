[00:01] <perllover> AlexDaniel still error https://pastebin.com/7HcPmqLR

[00:02] <AlexDaniel> yeah, that's the point

[00:02] <perllover> yea i understand. but you're saying you wouldn't get such an error when you run that 2-line code ?

[00:03] <AlexDaniel> yeah, no error here

[00:03] <HoboWithAShotgun> do we use prepan for 6 modules? if not, is there a similar place?

[00:04] <perllover> AlexDaniel what can i do?

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> well, as I said, you can try disabling ipv6 and trying again

[00:06] <perllover> do you think there's an easy way to do it in perl5?

[00:06] <perllover> i'm a bit rusty with perl5, however. but a quick way to convert that same code over

[00:07] <perllover> i'm nervous to disable ipv6. it looked risky

[00:07] <perllover> am i overreacting about ipv6 ?

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> it depends

[00:09] <perllover> depends on?

[05:51] *** wamba joined
[05:53] <wander> [Coke]: yes, I hesitate if it should be add

[05:53] <wander> 1. Telemetry::Period inherits from Telemetry, this is the main reason I add it

[05:57] <wander> 2. However, it's a rakudo-specific class, I wonder if it should even not be in /Types

[06:00] <wander> That's the problem, other classes in rakudo/rakudo/lib, such like `Pod::To::..`, `NativeCall` are not documented in /Types. But `Telemetry` is thought a useful class, at least lizmat wrote a initial doc of it.

[06:01] <wander> To resolve this problem, maybe we have to think about where a rakudo-specific class should be documented, if the doc.perl6.org, how we should doc it.

[13:29] <timotimo> aha, hyper hypers the values from both hashes together "quietly", that's why the + operator won't complain when one of the sides is undefined

[13:29] <timotimo> but this "undefined turns to 0" is a feature of Any, not of Int

[13:30] <timotimo> m: say Int + 5

[14:00] <AlexDaniel> docs also say ‚Äúas part of exponentiation‚Äù :)

[14:01] <sproctor> If we require a c lib to be installed for a module is there anyway of specifying it in the Meta? Or should the module include tests that fail in a helpful fashion if the lib doesn't exist? 

[14:01] <AlexDaniel> hmmm but the provided ASCII equivalents are maybe wrong, because it's a feature of its own

[14:08] <wander> several hours ago I saw this page

[14:08] <wander> https://github.com/perl6/perl6-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/documentation.md

[14:09] <wander> so hyper is an interesting while confusing part of Perl 6

[14:09] <timotimo> last update was on 10 dec 2015?

[14:09] <wander> especially whitespace matters

[14:10] <timotimo> given that hyper has just been re-implemented, i'd say this page might want to be reconsidered

[14:10] <wander> yes, I saw it because the latest update of the repo is some hours ago

[14:10] <wander> `has just`? when

[14:11] <jdv79> every midnight i want to calc "tomorrow at midnight" in my local tz and handle daylight savings and leap seconds properly.  how would you do that in p6?

[14:13] <ZzZombo> ugh, it's strange, I `make` an object that is then saved into an attribute of the actions object for the grammar, but it somehow always comes as the type  object, i. e. it's not initialized to the value I gave.

[14:13] <wander> ZzZombo: what's the code

[14:15] <timotimo> ZzZombo: could be a different match object you're looking at for some reason. or you could be storing Nil and it's restoring the default value because your rakudo is too old?

[14:25] <comborico1611> Why does a hash print out with => instead of -> ?

[14:25] <timotimo> because the => operator is how you create pairs

[14:25] <wander> m: :b(3).perl

[14:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar e3f6ababf: ( no output )

[14:25] <wander> m: :b(3).perl.say

[14:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar e3f6ababf: OUTPUT: ¬´:b(3)‚ê§¬ª

[14:25] <timotimo> there's different ways to print out a hash, though

[14:25] <timotimo> wander: that's just the pair, though

[14:26] <wander> m: { :b(3), c(4)}.perl.say

[14:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar e3f6ababf: OUTPUT: ¬´{:b(3), :c(4)}‚ê§¬ª

[14:27] <wander> comborico1611: for what reason you think it should print out with -> ?

[14:28] <comborico1611> Technically as comments. # -> value

[14:28] <timotimo> that's not about hashes

[14:28] <timotimo> that just means "here's what that evaluates to"

[14:28] <wander> agree

[14:28] <comborico1611> All the pages. 167 for instance.

[14:29] <timotimo> (either "what it evaluates to" or "what it prints out", depending on what the author likes more)

[14:29] <comborico1611> Oh, i see.

[14:29] <wander> in the very page, I've only found "# -> Found it!"

[14:30] <comborico1611> That's the print out.

[14:30] <comborico1611> I thought prompt returned -> value

[14:30] <wander> I think it means "# OUTPUT: ¬´Found it‚ê§¬ª"

[14:30] *** pmurias joined
[14:30] <comborico1611> I see.

[14:30] <timotimo> there ought to be a section near the front of the book that explains things like that

[14:31] <wander> so it has nothing to do with hash

[14:31] <comborico1611> He should have wrote on page 184 this: -> one => uno

[14:32] <comborico1611> He's just not been consistent with how he is doing the output. Actually now that I think about it, what's going on is he's using the other mode of rikudo.

[14:32] <ZzZombo> I `make` it this way in my `section` action method: `make my $section=Grammar::VDF::Section.new(:name($<name>.made),:condition($<conditional>.made));`

[14:32] <ZzZombo> later I assign that in another action method (by calling `$<section>.made`) and I get the type object instead.

[14:47] <holyghost2> I misposted my HollyGame toolkit for writing games at pause, I am probably going to port it to non-inline perl6

[14:47] <wander> real world issue, I crashed it once

[14:47] <holyghost2> It's at http://holyghost.yellowcouch.org/perl5/src

[14:47] <timotimo> holyghost2: i was quite confused by the email you sent :)

[14:47] <comborico1611> Is Binding the same as Aliasing?

[14:47] <holyghost2> you were ?

[14:48] <timotimo> yeah, the file you attached looked like 1:1 my particle system example from the SDL2::Raw repository

[14:48] <holyghost2> ok, I tried to port a small game library

[14:48] <holyghost2> It's still an issue

[14:48] <timotimo> the url you just posted is also 404 :(

[14:48] <holyghost2> aaaaaagh!

[14:49] <holyghost2> I do not remember the /ctcp send

[14:49] <census> i'm unable to run this code on my computer https://pastebin.com/qnYAZJ7v  but it should work. it works on other perl6 computers 

[14:49] <holyghost2> timotimo : I will first try to make it perl6 from perl5

[14:50] <holyghost2> I need a little time for that as I forgot my perl6 skills

[14:50] <wander> census: error msg?

[14:50] <timotimo> holyghost2: you'll probably find many sdl2 functions missing; that's just because i didn't know what order to do things in. if you need anything, feel free to open an issue on github or maybe even a pull request

[14:54] *** kerframil joined
[14:54] <timotimo> the sdl2 module doesn't expose any of the surface blitting stuff that you'd use if you only have sdl 1

[14:54] <wander> I'm not an expert on that.

[14:54] <census> wander an expert on what?

[14:54] <wander> WWW or net

[14:57] <holyghost2> It's in the ftp incoming of pause

[14:57] <perlpilot> holyghost2: I haven't seen your stuff either, but I think you should port it to SDL2  ;->

[14:58] <wander> .ask zoffix I bump version for Pod::To::HTML, but cannot upgrade with zef. also seems doc.perl6.org don't build with the newest Pod::To::HTML. why?

[14:58] <yoleaux> wander: I'll pass your message to zoffix.

[14:59] <holyghost2> It's a stupid class overriding system of a 2D collision system and some lists for NPCs

[14:59] <holyghost2> It's ok but basic

[15:00] <holyghost2> You can override with SDL images and so on

[15:04] <census> for any input, i always get 3 as the output https://pastebin.com/FAicYnH3

[15:04] <ZzZombo> <timotimo> dumb question, but the value in $section is correct afterwards?

[15:04] <ZzZombo> Well, almost... it itself lacks another object field that is set later in the `section` method... I wonder if it's the same thing.

[15:05] <holyghost2> ok

[15:05] *** ryn1x left
[15:05] <ZzZombo> I mean, the the name and value attributes of sections are ok, but not parent.

[15:06] <ZzZombo> parent is another section, and it's also undefined, even tho I do set it.

[15:06] <ZzZombo> Example: `Grammar::VDF::Section.new(condition => Grammar::VDF::Condition, name => "04", parent => Grammar::VDF::Node)`

[15:07] <ZzZombo> (condition is supposed to be undef right now, but maybe it's bugged as well).

[15:26] <Zoffix> wander: you can also install from github URLs btw; that way you don't need to wait for ecosystem list to update or to run `zef update`:  zef --force install https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-HTML.git

[15:29] <Zoffix> census: so number of rows in parsed CSV always gives you three... Sounds like dumping that CSV and ensuring it got right data up in it might be a good idea.

[15:31] <census2> It should say 755, but it says 978

[15:32] *** mcmillhj joined
[15:33] <wander> yes, i miss `update`

[15:34] <Zoffix> census2: why do you think it shouls say 755?

[15:34] *** ryn1x joined
[15:34] <census2> Zoffix because when i downloaded the .csv manually there are 757 rows but the first 2 are meaningless so 755

[15:35] <Zoffix> census2: I get 993 rows total when I open that CSV in Excel. With first 2 meaningless.

[15:36] <Zoffix> "that CSV" => the file downloaded by the program

[15:37] <census2> Zoffix i'm a little confused even why 993 if the code i'm running says 978

[15:37] <census2> I appreciate your looking into it! Are you saying the code is telling you 993 or you went to the website directly and got 993

[15:37] <wander> Zoffix: what is "upgrade the module on the build box" means?

[15:37] *** Phi_mb joined
[15:37] <wander> bad syntax :(

[15:39] <Zoffix> census2: if I go to https://patents.google.com/?q=Cancer&country=US&before=filing:20011231&after=filing:20010101 and click "Download CSV" I get 793 rows. But if I use the link the program uses ( https://patents.google.com/xhr/query?url=q%3DCancer%26country%3DUS%26before%3Dfiling%3A19901231%26after%3Dfiling%3A19900101&exp=&download=true ) I get 993 rows. So sounds like you got your CSV URL in the program wrong.

[17:43] <El_Che> pmurias: if the process is complicated docker is always an option

[17:44] <El_Che> if, let's say, you want to build the rakudo js against different distros, you can use a matrix and docker. Run are parallel, so you won't hit the 50m max

[17:54] <census> wander i love a good regex :)

[17:54] <timotimo> 5xx http codes are the server's fault

[17:54] <timotimo> 4xx codes are your fault

[17:55] <census> timotimo i was getting a 503 error for a website in which i was still able to get to the website in my browser

[17:55] <wander> census: pardon?

[17:55] <[Coke]> I would say that 4xx codes are "normal" errors and 5xx are "exceptional" ones.

[17:55] <dylanwh> census: no, it usually means some backend server is down, IME

[17:55] <census> <[Coke]> so i've added a sleep(120) to the code -- far from ideal though

[17:55] <census> dylanwh it's google

[17:55] <ugexe> i'd be surprised if google lets you crawl their services the way you are

[17:55] <dylanwh> that's... interesting

[17:55] <[Coke]> census: the request from your browser and the request from your command line are not necessarily the same request, and the server can respond how it wants.

[17:56] <sena_kun> if I have some non-BMP character(like 'üòÇ'), is there a way to get its surrogate pair?

[17:56] <[Coke]> if you're doing a crawler, for example, and you're not respecting the robots file, they can stop you however they want.

[17:57] <sena_kun> I've found algo to do it by hands, but just in case there is some predefined thing exists.

[17:57] <census> <[Coke]> i don't know what the robots file is. i'm okay making the code run very slowly. i read somewhere there's a limit of searchers per every 30 mins

[17:58] <ugexe> https://patents.google.com/robots.txt

[17:58] <census> ugexe what does that mean? i don't follow

[17:59] <[Coke]> if you're writing a crawler and dont know what robots.txt is, that could be problematic. (but as ugexe points out, that one seems permissive enough). but they could still be rate limiting you, sure. If there's no defined API, I'm not sure what you can do other than guess (if it were not google, I'd say "try to ask the support team for the site")

[17:59] <ugexe> it doesnt allow /q=

[18:07] <timotimo> they might have protection against people just grabbing the data from that url, but would allow people who are legit browsing the page through. so your program needs to seem like it's a legit human legit browsing their site?

[18:07] <census2> timotimo how may i set that up?

[18:08] <timotimo> no clue how exactly they do it

[18:08] <ugexe> basically. the less ethical way would be to use a pool of proxies and legit user agent strings, although driving a headless browser is becoming more of a requirement

[18:08] <census2> timotimo the only way i know is making changes like the user-agent to one that isn't perl6

[18:20] <census> <[Coke]> I'm totally okay with that. However, I can't even envision how such a code would go

[18:21] <ugexe> use Net::HTTP::GET; say Net::HTTP::GET("https://patents.google.com/?q=cancer&country=US&before=filing:20171231&after=filing:19900101") # this returns 200, but i imagine if i do it enough times it will start to 503

[18:21] *** Cabanossi left
[18:21] <census2> ugexe you mean it returns a 200 error but you envision a 503 error

[18:22] <ugexe> 200 is not an error, it is success

[18:22] *** mcmillhj left
[18:22] <[Coke]> when I've done this sort of exercise, I start with the browser, find what I need there, and assuming the urls are permissible, go through there. If the data is only available via an ajax call from a permissible page, then setting up a headless browser as ugexe suggested is probably the way to go (using something like selenium)

[18:22] <[Coke]> but if there's an old API, I'd definitely go through that route.

[18:22] <[Coke]> APIs are easier to code against, less fragile...

[18:22] <[Coke]> screen scraping HTML is always at best, problematic.

[18:23] <ugexe> especially scraping google stuff

[18:24] *** Cabanossi joined
[18:24] <census2> ugexe okay then what would you suggest so there wouldn't be a 503 error? isn't what you showed basically what I did just with NET::HTTP::GET rather than the libraries I did ?

[18:25] <census2> <[Coke]> i appreciate your help, but i don't follow how to change my approach to do your approach

[18:25] <census2> 1. start with the browser. (? is that not what i'm currently doing)  2. find what's needed there (i'm finding the .csv?)

[18:26] <census2> <[Coke]> how do I know if there's an API. i wrote this code--i did try hard

[18:26] <ugexe> basically even if this isn't your current problem, it will be eventually since you are crawling and not using their api

[18:29] <wander> Zoffix: thanks

[18:32] <ugexe> census2: doesn't look like it (I a made a query to it and it says it is closed). and the page you -were- using looks like it uses javascript to do the actual searching (so to scrape anything useful you need to render the page)

[18:32] <ugexe> and to render a page you need to render javascript, so again need to use a browser in some fashion

[18:38] <ugexe> you `use WWW::Mechanize::Firefox:from<Perl5>` after installing WWW::Mechanize::Firefox to perl5 and Inline::Perl5 to perl6, then you use the object as explained in the docs but use perl6 calling convention on the object instances you create (.foo() instead of ->foo())

[19:13] <knight__> lizmat: I have problem with modules

[19:14] <knight__> when I am executing script with modules from different directories

[19:14] <knight__> And I have not clue, how to fix it.

[19:14] <knight__> i use lib 'lib'

[19:14] * lizmat is not very versed in that area of the system either, maybe nine or ugexe or timotimo can help

[19:15] <lizmat> use lib gives you P5 module loading semantics

[19:15] <wander> Zoffix: does doc site really build with Pod::To::HTML:ver<0.3.11>? It's strange because /language/Regex still not escapeHTML in toc, but it should work since I built it locally(source same as perl6/doc:master) and got correct result

[19:15] *** mr-foobar left
[19:15] <lizmat> aka: a module Foo::Bar needs to be in lib/Foo/Bar.pm6

[19:15] <knight__> ok, thank you

[19:15] <knight__> I will try it

[19:16] <wander> or its build spends a lot of time

[19:17] *** cdg joined
[19:20] <knight__> lizmat: Ehm, it does not work :-X

[19:22] <knight__> @sirius:~/Skola/PJS2/projekt$ perl6 perl/main.p6 

[19:22] <knight__> ===SORRY!===

[19:22] <knight__> Could not find Bank::currency-value at line 67 in: /home/a/Skola/PJS2/projekt/lib

[19:22] <knight__> lizmat: 

[19:23] <knight__> so, as you can see, it will add path

[19:23] <knight__> but it is incorrect

[19:23] <knight__> it should be PJS2/projekt/perl/lib

[19:23] <knight__> I am using use lib 'lib';

[19:23] <knight__> and I am calling from directory one level up.

[19:24] <lizmat> so in what directory are you ?

[19:24] <knight__> a@sirius:~/Skola/PJS2/projekt

[19:24] <lizmat> looks like you should do    use lib 'perl/lib'   then

[19:24] <knight__> yep, but if someone call script from "something else"

[19:25] <knight__> It will not work

[19:25] <knight__> And it is problem for me.

[19:25] <lizmat> use lib '/home/a/Skola/PJS2/projekt/perl/lib' ?

[19:25] <knight__> but, what If I am on different computer?

[19:25] <knight__> And My script is not there

[19:25] <knight__> ;-)

[19:26] <knight__> is in different directory

[19:26] <knight__> i need make lib

[19:26] <knight__> with relative path

[19:26] <lizmat> then don't put the use lib in the code, but do it externally perl6 -Iperl/lib ?

[19:28] <knight__> I do not understand what is the point of doing NOT relative 'use lib 'lib''

[19:28] <knight__> Because I am calling module, which is in somewhere in directory

[19:28] <knight__> in relative path

[19:28] <knight__> And now I must use library arguments...

[19:29] <knight__> moritz: Are you there?

[19:29] <knight__> ^

[19:32] <knight__> Or, how can I do it.

[19:36] *** mcmillhj left
[19:40] <moritz> hm, what's up?

[19:40] <yoleaux> 18:01Z <wander> moritz: plz build the doc site using the newest module Pod::To::HTML:ver<0.3.11>. I've locally made and ensure it fixes perl6/doc#1662.

[19:40] <synopsebot> DOC#1662 [open]: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1662 "<!|w>" disappears in ToC of Regexes

[19:40] <perlpilot> knight__: sounds like you want Dir::Self for Perl¬†6.

[19:41] <knight__> perlpilot: It will work?

[19:41] <knight__> I think with "use"

[19:41] <knight__> because it is in compile time I guess..

[19:41] *** ryn1x left
[19:42] <moritz> wander: "zef upgrade Pod::To::HTML" says "All requested distributions are already at their latest versions"

[19:43] <wander> `zef update && zef upgrade Pod::To::HTML`?

[19:44] <moritz> same result

[19:44] <perlpilot> knight__: too many unknowns for me.  $*CWD tells you the dir from which you're running things if you want to make something relative to that.   Or if you need something like Dir::Self, you can make a sub that uses callframe.file to get the full path to the file that the sub is in, then make something relative to that.

[19:44] *** mcmillhj joined
[19:44] *** bdmatatu joined
[19:45] <wander> hmm, that is strange. different result between local make and the doc site

[19:45] <moritz> wander: it seems there is some lag in the ecosystem; will have to try again tomorrow

[19:47] *** mr-foobar joined
[19:47] <knight__> perlpilot: I want something like that, I am calling the file from different directory

[19:48] <knight__> So

[19:48] <knight__> I must change the path to the use lib some_path ~ '/lib';

[19:48] <knight__> because 'lib' is static path not relative

[19:48] <knight__> Yep, Dir::self

[19:49] *** philomath joined

[19:52] <ugexe> if you want to call a module by namespace where you dont know where it mat reside then -install- it

[19:53] <ugexe> otherwise its the same as in perl5 where you have to figure out inside your module what your current location is and what location you are looking for

[19:53] <census2> ugexe are you talking to me still? thanks :)

[19:54] <ugexe> census2: no

[19:54] <census2> ugexe so far i'm doing better with the sleep() and useragent in the program

[19:57] <wander> oops

[19:57] <[Coke]> you can also touch a file on the server to trigger it

[19:57] <wander> maybe this is the problem

[19:57] <[Coke]> for this very reason. :)

[19:58] <ugexe> also note that non-installed module use is not cross platform. for instance on mac osx `perl6 -Ilib -e 'use Bar;'` will load lib/bar.pm or lib/Bar.pm whereas on linux only lib/Bar.pm

[21:23] <dogbert17> you should also check that your factors are indeed prime numbers

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: Fix infinite loop when passing certain arrays to pg-array-str

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: 

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: The inputs that show the problem are: an array in item context, or a nested array with one element.

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: 

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: The problem is that `my @arr = ...` creates a new array instead of binding to the RHS.

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: So use `my @arr := ...` instead.

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: 

[22:07] <Geth> ¬¶ DBIish: This fixes issue #107.

[22:20] <comborico1611> Is the method Int in 50.rand.Int modifying random or 50?

[22:23] <geekosaur> it's operating on the result of 50.rand

[22:23] *** HaraldJoerg1 left
[22:23] <comborico1611> Thank you.

[22:24] <geekosaur> if you replace rand with something else, you can't know just by looking at it what it will do; that method could potentially return an object of any type, and Int is applied to that object

[22:25] *** niceperl joined
[22:25] <comborico1611> I see.

[22:29] <HelpWithPerl> Quick question: does if @x[$a] %% $y[^100000] be false if x[$a] is indivisible for just a single value of $y[something]?

[22:31] <AlexDaniel> HelpWithPerl: oh, that's not exactly what it does

[22:31] <HelpWithPerl> What does it do?

[22:31] <AlexDaniel> HelpWithPerl: it will probably numify $y[^100] and it'll turn into a number of elements

[22:31] *** dct left
[22:31] <AlexDaniel> so it's @x[$a] by the number of elements in $y[^10000]

[22:31] <HelpWithPerl> Oh

[22:31] <HelpWithPerl> Did not expect that :P

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> you need $y[^10000].any

[22:32] <AlexDaniel> or $y[^10000].all
