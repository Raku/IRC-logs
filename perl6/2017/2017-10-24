[00:00] <bazzaar> well simplistically I could eliminate case, and filter away 'prefixed-by-sigil' occurrences, it might be gnarly, but it could be useful, and perhaps be less of a source of frustration than the poorly populated utility tags collection is

[00:02] <ugexe> right, but the simplistic case is already served better by the simple regex it would require

[00:03] <ugexe> your idea is indefinitely better, but to achieve it is much more difficult (regex idea breaks down when its not so simple to come up with and type as a query)

[00:04] *** kyan left
[00:05] *** Kyo91_ left
[00:08] <bazzaar> agree that it might be a poor man's egrep, but it would be a first pass summary index of coding 'examples' embedded within the modules code, where the user only need to click to get some results

[00:13] *** Kyo91_ joined
[00:14] <ugexe> you could always write a microservice (with Cro or Bailador) to proof of concept, and then simply provide the module website API access to it should you decide it is polished enough

[00:14] <bazzaar> was just an idea that has sprung to my mind a few times, wanted to post it, appreciated folks taking the time to consider 

[00:14] <ugexe> come up with a list of keywords, and `git grep $_` your way to a database

[00:15] <ugexe> probably less than 100 lines of code, assuming you have something to clone the repos

[00:16] *** wamba left
[00:17] <ugexe> or write a bot to come in here and send `greppable6: $_` for all your keywords and build your database from that hehe

[00:17] <bazzaar> ugexe: thanks for the insight, I will pursue that line of approach :-)

[01:00] <Herby__> Also: how can I use a variable as a regex pattern? my @list-of-patterns[0;1] = '(\w+)'; say $/ if "some string" ~~ / @list-of-patterns[0;1] /;

[01:01] <Herby__> rather, how do i interpolate a variable in a regex pattern

[01:03] <MasterDuke> Herby__: just the variable if you want it interpreted as a string, <$var> if you want it interpreted as a regex, <{ code }> to execute the code and interpolate the results into the regex

[01:07] <Herby__> sorry

[01:07] <MasterDuke> Herby__: you might need to use EVAL, not 100% sure

[01:07] <Herby__> hmmm

[01:07] <MasterDuke> i.e., create the "regex" as a string and then EVAL that

[01:08] <geekosaur> it is known that subcaptures are lost in that case, I don't think anyone has sorted out why yet

[01:08] <MasterDuke> m: my $r = "/a(.)c/".EVAL; say "abc" ~~ $r

[01:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar e4a5bb17c: OUTPUT: «｢abc｣␤ 0 => ｢b｣␤»

[01:09] <Herby__> maybe there is a better way to accomplish my goal.  I have a list of regex patterns (that have capture groups) and I want to apply each pattern to a string

[01:12] <Herby__> MasterDuke: thanks

[12:38] <Zoffix> mienaikage: you can workaround it by not using the `:D` in your types or sticking `no precompilation` at the top of your module (note that'd cause it to be re-compiled each time which can make things very much slower)

[12:46] <perlpilot> huh ... I was just reading the weekly and the code for running "once in a batch" surprised me.  

[12:48] <lizmat> perlpilot: why ?

[12:48] <[Coke]> do we want doc tickets to get announced her?

[12:48] <[Coke]> *here

[12:49] <raschipi> yes

[12:50] <perlpilot> lizmat: because "once {...}*      run only once, suppressing additional evaluations"  That batching is a side-effect of .hyper/.race should factor in to that IMHO.  At least not without something more explicit.

[12:51] <perlpilot> *shouldn't

[12:52] <[Coke]> I would not expect once to mean "once per batch"

[12:52] <Zoffix> perlpilot: then which batch should it be run in?

[12:52] <Zoffix> The phasers will also get special treatment

[12:53] *** mson joined
[12:54] <Zoffix> [Coke]: it'd just need to add an event handler here https://github.com/perl6/geth/blob/master/lib/Geth/GitHub/Hooks.pm6#L114-L121 and IRC responder here: https://github.com/perl6/geth/blob/master/lib/Geth/Plugin/GitHub.pm6#L123  AlexDaniel` probably already has code for that from the squashable6 bot

[12:54] <lizmat> my proposal would be to *not* handle phasers in hypers/races differently

[12:54] <lizmat> but set a $*BATCH dynamic variable indicating that it's being run in a batch

[12:54] <perlpilot> Or put another way, if I have a .map that calls a function to do work and that function calls `once { }` somewhere down the line, will I accidentally change the semantics of the once block by adding .hyper or .race?

[12:54] <Zoffix> lizmat: but would it be per-batch?

[12:54] <lizmat> which could have additiional information, like batch number

[12:55] <Zoffix> perlpilot: yes

[12:55] <Zoffix> perlpilot: same as if you have that function do something thread-unsafe

[12:55] <lizmat> Zoffix: yes, a FIRST / LAST would be per batch

[12:56] <Zoffix> Yeah, sounds like what I was thinking

[12:56] <lizmat> *and* before the very first batch

[12:56] <lizmat> (FIRST that is)

[12:56] <lizmat> and after the very last batch (LAST)

[12:56] <lizmat> those two cases would *not* have $*BATCH set

[12:56] <Zoffix> Not that I know much about this part of language :)

[12:57] <lizmat> NEXT/REDO/ENTER/LEAVE phasers should work as normal

[12:59] * Zoffix had no problems a couple weeks ago

[13:00] <Zoffix> piojo: is that with a fresh checkout?

[13:00] <Zoffix> e.g. like these steps: https://github.com/zoffixznet/r#windows

[13:00] <Zoffix> That's how I built it a couple weeks ago

[13:00] <piojo> Zoffix: no, it's not. Thanks! I'll try that

[13:01] <perlpilot> anyway ... let's just say that I continue to be uncomfortable with the action-at-a-distance for once (and other phasers)

[13:01] <mienaikage> Zoffix: Thanks. I've added a little extra info on GH re: require as well

[13:01] <lizmat> perlpilot: what would be your suggestion?

[13:01] <lizmat> a complete new set of phasers ?

[13:02] <lizmat> or just no phasers (change the NYI into a real error)

[13:02] <lizmat> afk again&

[13:03] <perlpilot> I dunno, I'm not awake enough yet :-)   Maybe I'd be more comfortable if the documentation for .hyper/.race called these things out explicitly?   Right now, the weekly reads like ".hyper/.race makes things faster" (and I think that's how many people will think of them  too) but really it's more like ".hyper/.race will make things faster, but beware the semantic differences they impose upon certain phasers and phaser-like constructs"

[13:03] *** ggoebel left
[13:04] <Zoffix> perlpilot: my impression of watching this work from a distance is people seem to be expecting a magic "make it faster" button that will perform work on all the cores, when in reality there's gonna be a bunch of race conditions people will be struggling with or, like you point out, receiving new semantics for stuff like `once` because they expected the program to know when once has been executed already on one

[13:04] <Zoffix> of the threads. gfldex already had a bug in their code that cached a Seq twice from a hyper and it took even jnthn some time to figure out what the crash was about. I fully expect more of that stuff to turn up and possibly people eventually realizing .hyper/.race aren't a magical fire-and-forget make-it-faster solution

[13:13] <Zoffix> perlpilot: ^ (my last eval) another semantic difference. `for` is no longer just a `map` under the hood; it's `.serial.map` and a `for` without a `hyper` or `race` prefix iterates over HyperSeq and RaceSeq serially

[14:11] <Grimy> Maybe? They’re listed in S03.

[14:12] <Grimy> How do I know when an idea in the Synopses has been abandonned?

[14:12] <Zoffix> Ah, OK. Just vaugely recall TimToady talking about these 

[14:12] <Grimy> Also ...^ is implemented but isn’t listed in https://docs.perl6.org/routine.html

[14:13] <Zoffix> Grimy: no real way. Synopses are historical documents. Roast is the current spec. Some of the design desisions are archived ( e.g. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/2017-IO-Grant--Action-Plan.md )

[14:23] <Zoffix> FWIW, I closed a couple of NYI last week 'cause they were not applicable anymore. So I'd say just 'cause there's an NYI ticket doesn't mean it's accepted that it should be implemented that way or implemented at all.

[14:25] <[Coke]> I mean, why not 365.24? :)

[14:25] <Zoffix> :)

[14:29] <piojo> Thanks for the help, everyone--I found the problem was basically "git checkout master"--that does nothing, since there is no "master" branch in rakudo ;)

[14:29] <Zoffix> lol

[14:29] <piojo> so I had an old commit checked out the whole time, and didn't notice.

[14:29] <Zoffix> :)

[14:29] <piojo> :D

[14:29] <AlexDaniel`> well… maybe we should finally rename it

[14:29] <Grimy> Why is the branch named «nom», anyway?

[14:30] <Zoffix> Grimy: historical reasons. it started as "New Object Model" and eventually became the "master"

[14:30] <Grimy> Ooh ok

[14:30] <piojo> The funny thing is that it was in the first line of my bug report. It feels like I accidentally made a riddle

[14:31] <Zoffix> I like "nom" as name, though I admit to on occasion typing "git checkout master" only to be told there ain't no master... 

[14:31] <AlexDaniel`> I'm doing that all the time

[14:31] <AlexDaniel`> especially when working with moar or nqp

[14:32] <piojo> I'm surprised I didn't notice, but building moar then nqp then rakudo, the process gets a little robotic

[14:32] <moritz> I think we had an agreement that basically all core devs were fine with renaming nom to master

[14:32] <AlexDaniel`> OK

[14:32] <moritz> just nobody done it so far

[14:32] <AlexDaniel`> then will do it after the release

[14:32] <moritz> ++AlexDaniel`

[14:32] <piojo> good idea

[14:33] <stmuk> I think there may have been talk of using nom as a dev branch and master the release (or was it the other way round?)

[14:34] <Zoffix> Yeah, something like that. My pushback against that is people will be more loosy with pushing breaking changes and the commits have to be sequential anyway due to reliance on MoarVM/nqp/roast

[14:35] <piojo> That reminds me, do --gen-moar and --gen-nqp only use the latest release, or are there stable versions in between releases?

[14:35] <AlexDaniel`> I expect it to be consistent across the trio, so if it's “master” for nqp and moar, then let's please have “master” in rakudo

[14:35] <Zoffix> So "release" branch would be blocked anyway. The current system where people make scary changes in branches kinda more preferable IMO.

[14:35] <moritz> piojo: they use whatever is in tools/build/NQP_REVISION

[14:35] <moritz> or MOAR_REVISION in nqp

[14:36] <piojo> moritz: Is that bumped more frequently than the montly releases?

[14:36] <AlexDaniel`> piojo: yes

[14:36] <[Coke]> only slightly

[14:36] <piojo> oh, great

[14:36] <pmurias> Zoffix: if I remember correctly master was meant to be the nom commit that passes automated testing

[14:37] <Zoffix> pmurias: yeah. So what happens when latest nom commit doesn't pass stuff?

[14:37] <Zoffix> The devs won't care as much, since bleed users are using master and aren't affected, and the rest of the devs now have a breaking commit in their workflow

[14:37] <[Coke]> There's no rush to move it immediately post release; why don't we plan on having it hashed out in time to do so immediately after the next release?

[14:38] <stmuk> talking of "release" .. is there going to be one? :)

[14:38] * moritz kinda agrees with Zoffix 

[14:38] <moritz> at $work we had some kind of stabilization branch, and it didn't work out too well

[14:39] <Zoffix> BTW, that branch proposal is documented here: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/language_versions.md#rakudo-branches

[14:39] <moritz> people did stuff there that wasn't tested by the same mechanism as the trunk, and so we had untested releases

[14:40] <moritz> and the "oh, people can just use master" mentality also took hold, at least somewhat

[16:57] <knight__> How can I mix positional argument in perl6?

[16:58] *** telex joined
[17:00] <knight__> i want call function for example fun($a, b=>100, c=>300). Of course I can do it with ($a, $:b, $:c), but what if I want something like fun(20, 30, c=>300)?

[17:00] *** itaipu joined
[17:00] <timotimo> you can have three optional positional parameters and the three nameds

[17:00] <knight__> How can I do it without definition in signature?

[17:01] <timotimo> then depending on how many positionals were actually passed, you fill those into the variables you want

[17:01] *** ChoHag left

[18:40] <knight__> ok, this works https://ideone.com/sa8j79 ,but I do not understand why this not https://ideone.com/UOcLOj Can somebody explain me...

[18:41] <knight__> thanks :-X

[18:42] <ugexe> what is `Str $currency_?` supposed to mean?

[18:43] <ugexe> i see

[18:43] <knight__> I am calling method fun

[18:44] <ugexe> because your new method returns the result of say("..."), which is true

[18:44] <knight__> when 'new' method is not overrided It is works, but when I override it, fun method does not work

[18:44] <knight__> Ahm

[18:44] *** aindilis joined
[18:44] <knight__> I understand

[18:44] <ugexe> if you use .new you need to bless attributes

[18:44] <knight__> thank you!

[19:29] <AlexDaniel`> because I realize that some things are missing

[19:31] <tyil> you cant match spaces for iabbrev afaik, since spaces indicate the end of an abbreviation

[19:42] <tyil> oh, its not particularly missing

[19:43] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel`: just noticed the term doc you just linked to has a definition for Rat terms that includes numbers with a dot, but not for <1/3> forms. So what's happening there?

[19:49] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel`: ah, that makes sense. Then it doesn't really have a proper place in the docs except in Rat's own, does it? Unfortunate, as it surfaces as a higher-level feature.

[19:54] <TreyHarris> < n/d > form is clearly better than <n/d> for most uses where you'd use a literal, but it's not obvious unless you generally put spaces inside bracketing constructs (which in my experience most don't if the contents are very simple like 1/3)

[20:48] <timeless> [Coke]: anyway, TreyHarris is right, that sounds familiar

[20:48] <timeless> and i don't think i got very far w/ it. I suspect I still have access to the vm that hosts it

[20:48] <timeless> but it definitely isn't something i'm spending time on

[20:48] <timeless> (tomorrow's adventures are fighting ldap and jenkins)

[20:48] <[Coke]> TreyHarris: ok. tempted to rip it out, but will try to fix it instead.

[20:49] <TreyHarris> timeless: yeah, you mentioned trying to run it on 100 cores

[20:49] <timeless> yep, that's gcc112, the box i still use :)

[20:50] <TreyHarris> but Moore's law is still in effect, right? So between June and now ew've had a 100x speedup anyway. Just on chips that have had since June to evolve though, so if you rebooted a lot in the meantime you may not have as much speedup. ;-)

[20:51] * TreyHarris thinks this is how that works

[20:51] * timeless chuckles

[20:51] <timeless> actually there was a recent argument about moore's law

[20:52] <timeless> some pointed out that mostly we're getting more of a coore's law -- we can double computing power by doubling die count or something

[20:52] <TreyHarris> "recent" meaning every year since it was proposed? yes.

[20:52] <timeless> no

[20:52] <timeless> an argument about whether we're still properly shrinking, or whether we're just gaining by adding cores

[20:52] <timeless> i think intel came back and showed they could still gain by shrinking

[20:54] <timeless> -- it's actually 160 cores, but to be polite, I try to avoid using more than 100  :-)

[20:54] <[Coke]> (docs) anyone mind if I remove the highlight path that doesn't use proc::async? i seem to recall we only needed it for the mac.

[20:54] <timeless> back then, when I wasn't on gcc112, i was probably on a mac ;-)

[20:55] <timeless> anyway, i'm off, happy iterating

[20:56] <TreyHarris> sorry, was kidding again. No, in all seriousness, I think Moore's Law "informal" form, about the speed of a general-purpose consumer CPU to carry out however many ops/sec, has already died. but we are still cramming transistor density at predicted rates right now--we won't hit fundamental issues with unknown physics for at least a few more years, I think.
