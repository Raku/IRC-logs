[00:15] <zengargoyle> but really, make sure you remove the old package you installed.  then install as El_Che described. :)

[00:16] <Shanta> I used apt-get and it says it dose not exist.

[00:26] <Shanta> zengargoyle Finnely got the old perl 6 off the machine. When all else fails use synatic.

[00:26] *** rindolf left
[00:29] <zengargoyle> cool, make sure you have no perl6 and then it's probably best to follow El_Che's link to install up-to-date packages, it will probably work.

[00:30] *** shlomif2 left
[00:31] <zengargoyle> or you can try my thing with the manual PATH setting.  the `make install` really just installs perl6 into the ./install directory from where you ran the make command (it doesn't put it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or anything like that)

[00:32] <zengargoyle> you want to be able to `perl6 --version` and see 2017.06 ...

[00:52] <zengargoyle> .tell El_Che you might want to add at least the site directory to PATH so that scripts intalled by zef can be found.

[01:26] <zengargoyle> does p6 have the p5-like INSTALLSCRIPT thing where you tell the installer to put scripts in a certain location?

[02:36] <ugexe> well... the bin scripts get installed alongside other non-bin scripts. site/bin vendor/bin etc get *wrappers*

[02:37] <ugexe> and a single wrapper may point to multiple versions and/or auths

[02:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar c56f0a: OUTPUT: «Array|59257944␤Array|59258000␤Array|59257944␤»

[03:00] <ugexe> rouking: ^

[03:01] <zengargoyle> ugexe: ok, i thought only rakudobrew did the wrapper thing.

[03:01] <ugexe> if you're using rakudobrew you go through 2 wrappers

[03:02] *** Cabanossi left
[03:03] <zengargoyle> that's cool, but a bit weird too. :)

[03:04] <zengargoyle> i'm sure i have site in my bin for some reason.  maybe pre-zef?

[03:04] *** Cabanossi joined
[03:04] <ugexe> its a tad faster to use zef via `perl6 -MZef::CLI -e '' --help` than `zef --help`

[03:05] <ugexe> you point at site/bin if you don't use rakudobrew

[03:06] <zengargoyle> right, which is El_Che's rakudobrew .deb/.rpm/whatever that install to /opt/rakudobrew

[03:06] <zengargoyle> frak /opt/rakudo

[03:07] *** bjz left
[03:07] <zengargoyle> i assume it's just like a make install --previx=/opt/rakudo, no rakudobrew magic...

[03:08] <rouking> ugexe: thanks -- didn't know about WHICH or I would've tested it myself :P

[03:08] *** skids joined
[03:08] <ugexe> ok to be more precise: you should not have site/bin in your PATH if you also have a rakudobrew/bin in your PATH

[03:09] <ugexe> maybe he is using rakudobrew for a single install only, and maps the rest of the PATH stuff to that installation and not the rakudobrew shim directories

[03:09] *** zacts left
[03:10] <zengargoyle> ugexe: yeah, it's late and i'm tired. :)  El_Che's .deb/.rpm packages are not 'rakudobrew' and probably need site, vendor, ~/.perl6/bin in path or some things will not be found.

[03:11] <zengargoyle> assuming zef doesn't auto-wrap and move things to the base perl/bin

[03:12] <zengargoyle> i.e. i'm talking about making perl6 yourself, or using a package, not rakudobrew.

[03:13] <ugexe> zef doesn't wrap anything. by default it'll install to site/ or ~/.perl6 if thats not available, but they could have configured it to install to, say,  vendor/

[03:15] <zengargoyle> yeah, but El_Che's docs don't include either site or vendor in the "set your path to this" part.

[03:16] <zengargoyle> it's a really nice start, but it's my nature to complain. :P

[03:17] <zengargoyle> but it's still in the more for personal use stage where the default is going to be ~/.perl6

[03:17] <zengargoyle> vs an actual distro package.

[03:20] * zengargoyle just sets /path/to/rakudo to root:bin and rwxrwsr-x and adds myself to group bin to avoid the hassle and let other users get my stuff. :P

[03:21] <zengargoyle> ~.perl6 is a PITA

[03:22] <zengargoyle> anyways, bedtime.

[15:15] <araraloren> How using perl6 determine whether a file is block or socket file or not?

[15:16] <moritz> how would you do it in C, or in Perl 5?

[15:17] <araraloren> In C I will use fstat

[15:17] <araraloren> I don't know in perl5

[15:18] <moritz> then it's probably easiest to use NativeCall and fstat

[15:21] <araraloren> I thought IO::Path or IO::Spec::Unix have method for that..

[15:55] <timotimo> perl6 shies away from putting posixy things in core

[15:55] <Lambd0x> Hi there. I have a situation which is this: I developed an app in perl6 which runs ok in Linux. However, I'm also testing it to run with Windows, after stalling the last .msi Rakudo Star I needed to solve a dep for my app so I went to use zef and initially wasn't working because it needed git, after getting it one error to install the module used in my app still remained. It looks for a file in C:\Users\your-user\.zef\store\projects.json which doesn't 

[15:55] <Lambd0x> exists, but in the same dir there exits a file named packages.json. My question is, how can I get to fix this and install the module I need.

[15:55] <timotimo> i don't recall other good examples of things not in core, though

[15:56] <timotimo> you don't require git to install stuff with zef if you grab things from cpan or by giving it download links for github's zip files

[15:57] *** lichtkind left
[15:57] <Lambd0x> timotimo, I chose to install it. But it ain't the problem :D

[15:59] <araraloren> How you install git for win ?

[15:59] <Lambd0x> with an git installer for windows. It was ok. The problem was really the remainder error.

[16:00] <Lambd0x> When it starts the downloads of the deps for the modules, zef looks for a file in the dir I described above.

[16:01] *** rindolf joined
[16:01] <Lambd0x> Hence it doesn't find it, it quits the download of the module.

[16:01] <Lambd0x> *a

[16:03] <araraloren> You can try run `zef update` first

[16:05] *** zakharyas left
[16:05] *** ChoHag joined
[16:05] <Lambd0x> same problem

[16:09] <Lambd0x> I'm actually trying. I'll have to write manually the contents of the image since the pastbin client for windows doesn't allows for pastebin images

[16:20] *** domidumont left
[16:20] <Lambd0x> araraloren, Nops, what does exists as I stated earlier is the file called packages.json and packages.json.bak

[16:21] <Lambd0x> I tried creating the filename, but don't work. I'm running cmd.exe with admin access btw.

[16:21] <araraloren> I check on my pc, it was exists

[16:22] <araraloren> IDK, maybe you can ask zef's author

[16:23] <Lambd0x> which version of rakudo star you have, my friend?

[16:23] <araraloren> I think packages.json would be exists in sub directory of **store/**

[16:23] <Lambd0x> I'm using the one of two months ago (latest release)

[16:24] <araraloren> I manual install from rakudo source

[16:24] <Lambd0x> I see.

[16:24] <araraloren> Maybe you can reinstall zef by yourself

[16:24] <araraloren> only zef

[16:24] <Lambd0x> I guess. Will get a terminal emulator running for that purpose then.

[16:24] <Lambd0x> Thks.

[16:25] *** jamesaxl_ left
[16:25] <araraloren> my version is old too, it was version 2017.02

[18:38] <BenGoldberg> So I'm attempting to implement perl class representing a fixed-length C array, by defining a class with a repr of CStruct, and appropriately large; I do nativecast( CArray[...], self )  for efficient access.  *however*, I want to cache the result of the cast, and I'm not sure how to do so.

[19:19] <moritz> how do you cache something? by assigning it to a variable

[19:26] *** domidumont left
[19:27] <BenGoldberg> And how do I make sure that that variable has the same lifetime as a particular object?

[19:27] <timotimo> make it an attribute :)

[19:28] <BenGoldberg> And how do I make it an attribute, when the class I want to make it an attribute *of*, has repr('CStruct')?

[19:30] * BenGoldberg gives up.  I'll just implement PositionalBindFailover, and let the array version get (re)generated on an as-needed basis.  Not precisely performant, *shrug*

[19:31] <timotimo> might have to use composition for that

[19:31] <timotimo> hmm

[19:34] <moritz> BenGoldberg: you make a container object that has both the repr('CStruct') as an attribute, and the cached value as another attribute

[19:34] <timotimo> the problem is that you can't just pass that CStruct to native functions/methods
