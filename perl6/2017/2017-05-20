[00:37] <Todd_> Hi Everyone.  I need to ask a question about zef.  I am about to install a module with it.  Is there a way to tell zef I want the module stored in the universal location and not some user's profile?

[00:39] <Todd_> Actaully, how do I tell the zef creator I also want zef stored globally?

[00:44] <Todd_> okay, I jsut did a global find on zef and removed everything.  Then reinstalled zef and it when into /usr/lib64/perl6/site/bin which makes me happy.

[10:23] <tbrowder> hi #perl6

[10:25] <lizmat> tbrowder  o/

[10:26] <tbrowder> i think the docs need a new entry under Language, called something like Core Modules, that lists modules included with Perl 6.  they probably should also be listed in modules.perl6.org. opinions? hi, lizmat!

[10:27] <lizmat> tbrowder: re CORE Modules, seems like a good idea

[10:28] <tbrowder> yeah, i keep wasting time looking for Pod::To::Text...

[10:29] <tbrowder> and forgetting it is in rakudo

[10:29] <lizmat> well, maybe that *should* live as a module, similarly to TAP.pm6 perhaps ?

[10:31] <tbrowder> hm, sounds good to me.

[10:33] <tbrowder> which of the core modules really need to be in core?

[10:34] <tbrowder> perl 5 over the years has moved out some core modules

[10:35] <lizmat> well, I think the list that can be moved is actually pretty small

[10:37] <tbrowder> anyhoo, that's probably something for another time...i'll try to add a  doc chunk later

[14:01] <nine> tbrowder: CompUnit::Repository::Staging is _not_ for zef. It's for installing modules into a staging area and moving them into their final position later on, i.e. creating distro packages.

[14:01] *** eyck joined
[14:02] <nine> lizmat: yes, I'm just still not used to using .pm6 as extension :)

[14:02] <lizmat> ok, propose we change that after the release  :-)

[14:03] <tbrowder> nine: so it should be listed under internal modules then??

[14:04] <lizmat> tbrowder: no, it's about .pm vs .pm6

[14:05] <nadim> not using .pm6 either, maybe I should change alll the modules I have while I have so few. do we have a P6 syntax for vim somewhere?

[14:05] <tbrowder> i was referring to nine's comment about the use of compunit...staging

[14:06] <tbrowder> should i move it to the list of internal-use modules?

[14:08] <MasterDuke> nadim: i think it's built-in to recent versions of vim now

[14:08] <yoleaux> 10:47Z <brrt> MasterDuke: i'll look into it

[14:08] <tbrowder> i'll remove the use comment anyway...

[14:08] <nadim> can someone have a look at travis,yml at https://github.com/nkh/P6-Data-Dump-Tree and tell me if they see something obviously wrong?

[14:09] <tbrowder> change panda to zef

[14:09] <nadim> ok

[14:11] <nadim> what would be the exact config? still need a "rekudobrew something" in the yaml file?

[14:11] <nadim> I mean: how does Zef get installed?

[17:12] <Zoffix> araraloren: I think ugexe++ was going to add a helper unzip script to zef so that `unzip` command is not required. So then the Issue I opened wouldn't matter

[17:12] <Zoffix> araraloren: OR, upload to CPAN. zef now defaults to it, as I understand

[17:14] <Zoffix> araraloren: and I see Inline::Perl5 links in ecosystem like this: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/blob/master/META.list#L277  and look at the source URL... A CPAN dist: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niner/Inline-Perl5/aa06e66e937f49f9061de4aed6a43cc4d796948d/META6.json

[17:22] <yoleaux> araraloren: I'll pass your message to Zoffix.

[17:37] <tbrowder> ugexe recommends zip version release for cross-platform use

[17:38] <ugexe> tbrowder: eh Zoffix proved me wrong when his linux dist didnt have a way to unzip

[17:39] <tbrowder> well he needs to add zip package to it

[17:39] <ugexe> the same can be said from the other side

[17:39] <tbrowder> we linux peops are much more forgiving than msw

[17:40] <ugexe> .tar.gz should be cross platform enough. just not on windows without perl5 in PATH

[17:40] *** astj left
[17:41] <tbrowder> so do we now need two source url entries?

[17:41] <araraloren> Use a zip module as backend would be better. It's reliable than zip command.

[17:43] <nadim> not using .pm6 either, maybe I should change alll the modules I have while I have so few. do we have a P6 syntax for vim somewhere? pretend it is not installed even if it is?

[17:45] <tbrowder> ahem, at some point it seems to me we need some kind of module check for minimum requirements before a module can be entered into the ecosystem. there are new entries without any functionality at all--basically a skeleton WIP.

[17:45] <nadim> thanks araraloren, the message above is garbage, half an old question and half a new one. typo of the day :)

[17:46] <araraloren> oh

[17:51] <nadim> is it possible to tell prove to "not find a module" even if it is installed? I want to test as if Term::ANSIColors wasn't there without modifying 50 tests.

[18:36] <moritz> MasterDuke: thanks

[18:40] <mst> 1 (I did vote), because the other two I think I can grok from the reference docs

[18:46] <moritz> I wonder if a Perl 6 version of "Mastering Regular Expressions" is in order

[18:49] <moritz> does anybody here know Jeffrey Friedl personally, and would be willing to introduce me to him?

[18:49] <MasterDuke> i love that book. one of the only two reference/programming books i've read cover-to-cover (the other being programming perl)

[18:51] <moritz> I love it too, and regularly recommend it

[18:54] <moritz> he, so far there are 8 responses, and the percentages are 75, 13, 12

[18:54] <moritz> rounding in action, I suppose :-)

[18:55] <mst> oh dear

[18:56] *** Cabanossi left
[18:56] *** tokomer left
[18:57] *** Cabanossi joined
[18:58] <moritz> I've actually written code that does similarly horrible rounding

[18:59] <moritz> exporting invoice data to the finacial accounting system, breaking it down into cost centers

[19:00] <moritz> and it's super important that the book entries sum up to the total on the invoice, but much less important if one of the cost centres is a cent off

[19:01] <moritz> if the rounding error is 0.01, I can just put it on "misc", but -0.01 isn't acceptable, so I have add that randomly to one of the other cost centers

[19:12] <haxmeister> \o/ :-D

[19:14] <haxmeister> chaining functions with dot notation is my new favorite syntax to abuse :-D

[19:20] <AlexDaniel> abuse it is :)

[19:22] <haxmeister> well that is what many people secretly love about perl right?.. all that syntactic sugar that we can abuse in our own scripts.. you know those scripts we keep for ourselves and hopefully never show to anybody else

[19:22] *** labster joined
[19:24] <moritz> or not so secretly :-)

[19:26] <mst> I'm pretty much ok with the idea that perls are expressive, and that gives you the potential to write both extremely readable and extremely unreadable code

[19:27] <haxmeister> I tend to lean towards the "wth is that?" readability rating lol

[19:28] <haxmeister> sometimes the "why did you do it like that?" zone as well

[21:05] <Voldenet> the thing I'll ask now is very evil, but I'll ask anyway

[21:05] <Voldenet> can you run perl6 with python interpreter?

[21:07] <jnthn> Haven't heard of a bridge in that direction, no. You can via Inline::Python use python modules from Perl 6, though (which works by embedding a Python interpreter). :)

[21:23] <nadim> moritz: I want to make sure Term::ANSIColor is not loaded during tests as the module  generates a different output when it is found.

[21:25] <jnthn> nadim: Does it do a runtime require of it?

[21:26] <jnthn> (Guarded with try?)

[21:26] <jnthn> It's not an especially "clever" solution, but I'd probably just env var it.

[21:27] <jnthn> (Have an env var that, if set, causes the require to not be attempted)

[21:28] <jnthn> Another potential (though utter hack) option is to have a t/hack/Term/ANSIColor.pm6 that simply dies upon being loaded and the -It/hack so it takes precedence and hides the real one

[23:58] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: if cats are arrays, and you have a list of cats, how do you put them into @a and @b ?

[23:59] <timotimo> huh, i meant to write this in a different channel

[23:59] <timotimo> i should maybe put on my glasses for computer use

[23:59] <timotimo> no matter

[23:59] <AlexDaniel> m: sub foo { my @a = 1,2,3; my @b = <a b c>; return @a, @b; }; my ($a, $b) = foo; dd $a; dd $b

[23:59] <AlexDaniel> that's one way to do it, but what if I insist on @a and @b?
