[00:00] <samcv> err no  9.24x faster

[00:00] <samcv> yay

[00:00] <raschipi> yay!

[00:00] <raschipi> taht's awesome, samcv

[00:02] <samcv> to get a really nice boost when the haystack is made up of strands, i could have the KMP algorithm use a grapheme iterator but that'd be a lot of work since instead of getting a grapheme by index in the string it gets each one, one after another

[00:08] <samcv> raschipi, i wonder if that makes building rakudo any faster

[00:08] <samcv> since that may happen a lot

[00:09] *** ccntrq left
[00:09] *** Kyo91_ joined
[00:09] <raschipi> It's like the linux kernel hackers, the usecase they care most when developing the scheduler is someone working on code while GCC runs on the back

[00:09] *** ccntrq joined
[00:12] <samcv> what i think i'm gonna make is a caching grapheme iterator

[00:13] <samcv> it stores a normal grapheme iterator plus also stores its current location and it caches the value it last returned, so you can request the same grapheme a second time and it'll pass it back to you

[00:13] <samcv> since the knuth morris pratt algorithm never goes backwards but very often can check the same grapheme twice

[00:13] *** Kyo91_ left
[00:14] <skids> Heck I'm enjoying the 60-second 'Stage parse' these days.  Used to be like 79.

[00:14] *** mcmillhj joined
[00:14] <raschipi> You know linux has special support for that, right? Building in the background while coding... Launch builds in a separate session and the kernel will ensure the active one is completely responsive.

[00:15] <samcv> raschipi, ah has it already sped up a lot?

[00:15] <skids> Well, the 79 seconds was probably like 4 months ago or so.

[00:15] <raschipi> <ctrl>-<alt>-<f1-12>  will start a new session, and you can go back with <alt>-<f1-12>.

[00:15] *** Cabanossi left
[00:15] <samcv> yeah i know that

[00:16] <raschipi> samcv: No, it will be s little bit slower, but won't make a text editor lag.

[00:16] <skids> raschipi: us ancients just call that "switching VTs"

[00:16] *** Cabanossi joined
[00:17] *** hunter_ left
[00:18] <raschipi> Yeah, but the important part here is that it also changes the session, not just th vt. vt-> console subsystem concept. session->scheduler concept

[00:19] *** mcmillhj left
[00:26] <raschipi> This is a sysadmin nitpick, of course, but it's possible to build linux with CONFIG_VT=n so one doesn't have virtual terminals anymore (except for the pseudo ones) but there will still be sessions.

[00:29] *** cpage_ joined
[00:30] *** ryu0 joined
[00:32] <raschipi> The init system will launch each service in a new session but won't connect them to a vt. When connecting the kernel log ring to a vt, there will be a vt but no session.

[00:35] <skids> just use setsid(1)?

[00:40] <samcv> wow. ok it works. my caching grapheme iterator. neato

[00:44] *** llfourn left
[00:45] *** cdg joined
[00:46] <raschipi> skids, then youll have to be the session leader and there's plenty of setup, it's not straighforward.  Anywy I was just explaining why I used precise terminology instead of the traditional one.

[00:46] <raschipi> samcv: how much faster?

[00:46] <raschipi> samcv is a ricer.

[00:58] <Zoffix> Wonder if GitHub tries to be too smart and converts nbsps to spaces when you're using the online editor... I'm fairly certain I did insert nbsps in those FAQ sentences when I edited them

[01:00] <samcv> nice i'm getting 2.5x faster nqp::index when the Haystack is made up of strands with caching and saving the graphemeiterator

[01:00] <samcv> \o/

[01:00] <mst> I wouldn't trust the online editor for anything personally; ingy's git-hub plus a command line actually does what it's told. but I know that's me being a curmudgeon, so please don't take that as a criticism or whatever

[01:00] <samcv> did some statistics doing nqp::index("aaaag" x 100000000 ~ 'h', 'aaagh')

[01:01] <samcv> cache_hit: 200000000 jump: 0 next: 500000000 # so 200000000 times it requested the same grapheme again. and 500000000 times requested the grapheme after the previous

[04:31] <Xliff> samcv: Adding the proper argument to GNU's make

[04:31] <Xliff> -J I think

[04:31] <samcv> -j

[04:31] <Xliff> so -J <num threads>

[04:31] <Xliff> Oh. Well.

[04:31] <samcv> that won't do too much

[04:32] <Xliff> :(

[04:32] <Xliff> No, it won't help stage parse, but it should get there faster. :/

[04:32] <samcv> i have: alias make="make -j $(($(nproc) - 1))"

[04:33] <samcv> but most of the perl 6 stuff is linear since it's bootstrapping compilier

[04:41] <japhb> protium: Currency math is often fixed-point (neither floating point nor abitrary-denominator rational arithmetic).

[04:42] <protium> japhb: That makes sense — is there a better way to do it than I was thinking? I am certainly no expert

[04:42] <japhb> Just something to watch out for ... the difference may show up as e.g. a few pennies off in a pile of calculations.

[04:43] <japhb> As for a better way ... well, when I did that kind of work, I did all calculations in whole millicents.

[04:43] <japhb> (So every amount specified in fractional dollars was multiplied by 100,000 and carried out in exact integer math)

[04:43] *** AnotherNick joined
[04:44] <japhb> I carried millicents in all internal data structures, and converted at first input and final output.

[04:44] <protium> japhb: I thought about that too, and then thought it would be tedious converting back and forth. Nevertheless, that's probably what I should do, too

[04:44] *** Cabanossi left
[04:45] *** Cabanossi joined
[04:46] <protium> And you're right about the differences, I am pennies out here and there

[04:46] <protium> But that gets annoying when reconciling, so I finally thought I should clean it up

[04:46] <japhb> However you do it, make sure your test suite is strong enough to catch common mistakes (mixing floating point, rational, and fixed-point match in different calculations -- easy to do when you e.g. calculation taxes or interest -- forgetting to convert fixed point back and forth)

[04:47] <japhb> (Trivia: One of the first major cases of international computer espionage was discovered because of a penny-scale failure to reconcile two different computer billing systems.)

[04:48] <protium> Very interesting.

[04:48] <protium> Is there somewhere I can read about that?

[04:48] <japhb> Clifford Stoll: The Cuckoo's Egg.

[04:48] <japhb> I can't believe I can still remember that off the top of my head.

[04:48] <protium> And yes, that's a good point, I should write some more tests when I refactor

[04:49] *** MasterDuke left
[04:51] <raschipi> If you're up to a deep refactoring, you could write types that did all the boring stuf and them teach the operators how to deal with them. This way you'd get rid of the cruft and have clean code at the end.

[04:52] <teatime> japhb: neat.

[04:52] <raschipi> And have them write out the correct format when you convert to string.

[04:52] <japhb> Oh, one final bit: When you do need to do a calculation where you'll have to temporary work in higher precision -- calculating tax on your value in millicents, for example -- remember to round-to-even when going back to your fixed-point format.  This keeps half values from always rounding the same way and slowly drifting the calculation in a single direction, rather than jittering around zero error.  That drift was why round-to-even was invented; it would become vi

[04:53] <teatime> cut off, "it would become vi" ...

[04:53] <protium> Thanks for that! Yes, that's a really good idea

[04:53] <japhb> it would become visible in stock exchange transaction levels.

[04:54] <protium> Both, though I am not sure that I want to do as deep a refactoring as to start making types, though that would probably yield the cleanest code in the end...

[04:54] <japhb> At some point you have to stop yak shaving.  :-)

[04:57] <raschipi> protium: do it and them publish it as a module so that other people can ensure your math works

[04:59] <protium> Well, could roll my own there, or probably I could just use Math::Currency

[05:00] <raschipi> You know how it works, the easiest way to get the correct answer is not to ask for it, but to publish the wrong one.

[05:00] <japhb> raschipi: That only works if the right person happens to notice said wrong answer.  :-)

[05:01] <raschipi> Well, he could come here and tell you he figured a better way of doing it.

[05:02] <raschipi> protium: Yeah, write perl6 bindings to it and you're set.

[05:03] <protium> Decisions, decisions...

[05:03] <protium> Well, thanks for all the info, this will be good. Hopefully doing this will eliminate the small current amount of glitchiness that I've got

[05:05] <raschipi> G'night people.

[14:16] <timotimo> because the line numbers i get in my profile are weird

[14:19] <lizmat> yes, you do!

[14:21] <raschipi> profiler tui explorer sounds sweet

[14:21] <timotimo> it can already display a tiny bit of stuff

[14:22] <timotimo> then i got distracted wanting to write a unicode-and-ansi-color segmented-bar-graph thingie

[14:22] <timotimo> sadly it's not trivial :P

[15:23] <lancew> Hello all, I am experiencing issues installing DBIish, with NativeHelpers::Blob failing, is this something others have encountered?

[15:25] <lancew> Here is example of the errors I see: https://gist.github.com/lancew/cd281098cf75973ebcb494f1a4a9098e

[15:26] *** raschipi_ joined
[15:27] *** raschipi left
[15:28] <ugexe> hey lancew - it ended up being an error in DBIish that never bubbled up until the last rakudo release

[15:28] *** raschipi_ is now known as raschipi

[15:29] <lancew> ugexe ok, I thought someone else would have to have encountered this

[15:29] <ugexe> give me a minute and i'll see if i cant get you a workaround

[15:30] <lancew> Thanks!

[15:30] *** st_elmo joined
[15:35] <ugexe> darn, looks like there is another error though (which I remember nine found a week or so back)

[15:35] <ugexe> zef install  https://github.com/ugexe/NativeHelpers-Blob.git@3108ac4 (this has your error patched, but then hits the second problem :( )

[15:47] <lancew> Sorry, I have no idea what 'moar-2017.07' is

[15:48] <ugexe> you'd have to `rakudobrew build moar 2017.07` first then

[15:48] <ryu0> But waits, there's moar!

[15:48] <lancew> ahhh ok

[15:55] <[Coke]> what OS?

[15:56] <sumdoc> Coke This is Rakudo version 2017.07 built on MoarVM version 2017.07 implementing Perl 6.c.

[15:56] <[Coke]> did you cut and paste the command you're running exactly?

[15:56] <sumdoc> Windows 10 64 bit

[15:56] <sumdoc> Coke Yes

[15:57] <sumdoc> Coke Can you see the last comment in this discussion by Yihui

[15:57] <lancew> sumdoc, does Coke's example work for you (  perl6 -e 'say 3.^name'  )?

[15:57] *** mcmillhj left
[15:58] *** pilne left
[15:58] <sumdoc> lancew No. Its throwing this error "===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e Unable to parse expression in single quotes; couldn't find final "'" at -e:1 ------> 'say<HERE><EOL>     expecting any of:         single quotes         term"

[15:59] <jnthn> iirc, the Windows command prompt doesn't deal with single quotes, only double

[15:59] <jnthn> perl6 -e "say 'hello'" likely works

[15:59] <[Coke]> checking.

[16:00] *** lizmat left
[16:00] <sumdoc> Coke lancew Looks like bug in the windows build. It though works in this docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/sumdoc/exper2/

[16:01] <[Coke]> jnthn++ has it.

[16:01] <lancew> That would make sense sumdoc that docker image is Debian. :-)

[16:01] *** mcmillhj joined
[16:01] <[Coke]> works fine with double quotes as the command quotes.

[16:02] * [Coke] hurls https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24173825/what-does-single-quote-do-in-windows-batch-files

[16:02] * lancew now has a happy looking DBIish install, cheers!

[16:02] <[Coke]> the docker image is no doubt running a linux variant, where the shell can handle either quoting mechanism.

[16:02] <TimToady> on windows you have to use "" for shell quoting, don't you?

[16:03] * lancew goes back to trying his hand at Bailador

[16:03] <TimToady> oh, jnthn++ got it already

[16:03] <TimToady> and [Coke]++

[16:03] * TimToady crawls back to his coffeemaker

[16:04] <lancew> lol... now watching "zef install bailador" install. Should have figured out that I'd need to install that again too. :-)

[16:05] *** zakharyas left
[16:05] <[Coke]> TimToady: I was kidding about nbsp'ing the version, probably don't do that. :)

[16:05] <TimToady> figgered

[16:06] <ugexe> strange, after installing DBIish in 2017.07 I switched back to 2017.08 and its no longer failing

[16:06] <lancew> ugexe, odd. I'll try in a sec also

[16:06] *** mcmillhj left
[16:08] <ufobat> lancew, i am going to make a new bailador release today or tomorrow, fyi

[16:08] <sumdoc> Coke TimToady jnthn With double quote, yeah it works

[16:09] <ugexe> or just use powershell

[16:11] <lancew> ufobat, great stuff. I'm slowly getting there with it. :-)
