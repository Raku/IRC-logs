[19:22] <Zoffix> Is a way to specify a horizontal rule in POD6? Like if I were writing in a book, I'd use centered "\n***\n" between the paragraphs and in HTML I'd use <hr>... Is there a POD6 directive that lets you do something similar? a "section break"

[19:27] <TreyHarris> Zoffix: grepping ALL-MODULES, looks like a "=begin Html\n\n<hr />\n\n=end Html" is the way it's been done so far

[19:27] <TreyHarris> I don't see anything in POD6 that would emit an explicit hr tag

[19:28] <Zoffix> OK. Thanks

[19:28] <Zoffix> Seems Pod::To::HTML has a bug it renders that as "<p><hr></p>" :/

[19:28] <TreyHarris> :-/

[19:28] *** darutoko left
[19:29] <TreyHarris> For display purposes, that shouldn't make much difference though

[19:30] <Zoffix> Unless you're using a wonky browser that's unhappy with invalid markup :)

[19:30] <haxmeister> doesn't <p> add a preceding break?

[19:30] <timotimo> it's a block element by default, so it will in effect do that

[19:31] *** kyclark joined

[19:32] *** Cabanossi left
[19:32] <Zoffix> haxmeister: <p> element cannot contain block level elements, of which <hr> is one, and its closing tag is optional (closed by any block elemnt), so it's '<p></p><hr>' with a dangling </p> 

[19:33] <Zoffix> If you mean about margins... yeah, it adds margins, but I want MOAR margin :D

[19:33] <Zoffix> section break

[19:33] <haxmeister> didn't know <p> doesn't require a closing tag :/

[19:33] *** domidumont joined
[19:34] <Zoffix> haxmeister: and html/body/head are not required at all :) Though I noticed some search engines choke when they're missing

[19:34] <Zoffix> There's no ambiguity

[19:34] *** Cabanossi joined

[19:39] *** Guest52168 left
[19:39] <TreyHarris> haxmeister: you're probably aware HTML5 is no longer SGML (and pre-XHTML HTML was just barely); the autoclosing is one of the behaviors

[19:39] <[Coke]> (might be a dayjob networking issue)

[19:41] *** labster joined
[19:41] <raschipi> At least they made these things standard. Much better than before where it was supposed to be SGML but browsers accepted it anyway and there was no way to know how it would behave.

[19:42] *** Ven_ joined
[19:43] <haxmeister> TreyHarris: no I didn't know that at all... always just assumed I should close them properly.

[19:44] <haxmeister> sounds kind of backwards to me though.. wasn't xhtml supposed to be the next progression in standards??

[19:44] <TreyHarris> Yeah. Otherwise <p> tag handling particularly would be madness, since it went from delimiter to enclosure and HTML in the wild had <p />, and and and... the autoclosing is kind of like rules that make it less important in modern languages to know and consistently use semicolon as a delimiter or as a terminator.

[19:45] <raschipi> No, no one adopted xhtml because it was bad for clients. A single typo would take an entire websites ot.

[19:45] <TreyHarris> haxmeister: no, HTML5 abandoned the move towards XMLization

[19:45] <TreyHarris> == raschipi 

[19:45] <haxmeister> I guess xhtml was a flop then eh?..lol

[19:45] <TreyHarris> validating HTML as a DTD has catastrophic failure patterns

[19:46] <raschipi> Just like Unicode in Perl6

[19:46] <TreyHarris> you ain't wrong...

[19:46] <moritz> that's not very XMLized, right

[19:47] <raschipi> a single malformed byte makes the program die.

[19:47] *** Ven_ left
[19:48] <moritz> just like it should be

[19:48] <moritz> just like a single malformed bytes makes every json or yaml or XML decoder die

[19:48] <haxmeister> well I abandoned the idea of designing webpages for a living 15years ago when the world decided you needed to have a team and code in 6 different languages to compete..lol

[19:48] <raschipi> that's DoS right at my fingertips

[19:49] <moritz> raschipi: no more or less than any other input that comes with validation

[19:50] <haxmeister> you know.. if it would just die, how many hackings would have been prevented?.. I can think of a few

[19:50] <raschipi> It should do validation but use the other option the standard gives

[19:50] <TreyHarris> It's good for reasons beyond validation. It's simpler. The standard HTML5 skeleton is basically exactly the same as the first HTML you ever learned to write if you learned HTML back at the dawn of the Web. They jettisoned all the cruft that had accumulated mostly just for syntactic reasons

[19:55] <haxmeister> javascript is the most widely abused language in the world

[20:00] <TreyHarris> hythm: unless you meant ^^

[20:01] *** zakharyas joined
[20:02] <TreyHarris> haxmeister: much of HTML5 was designed so that HTML/CSS/JS each do their respective things without taking over the roles of the others, but that doesn't mean people actually follow that design (especially since for awhile yet they currently still need to interoperate with older browsers)

[20:04] <TreyHarris> There was a period when it seriously looked like HTML5 would eliminate the style attribute to at least force CSS to be kept separate. But the transition would have been too hard so that idea was dropped.

[20:04] <hythm> TreyHarris, I did not mean to inherit whole classes, but was thinking that there might be a shorter way: As I dont think I will make use of $.h1 and $.h2 attributes after that

[20:05] <TreyHarris> hythm: if you never rever to the attributes, then except in typing terms how is your class not a subclass of both? I mean, TMTOWTDI of course

[20:09] <hythm> TreyHarris actually you are right, I'm just playing around with OO to get familira with it's concepts

[20:11] <TreyHarris> hythm++

[20:11] <hythm> I wanted to see if there is different syntaxs, instead of using an attribute, may be a trait "handles"  class C handles A,B { }

[20:12] <hythm> but again, it is not so much differnt than just inherits it with "is" trait

[20:12] <moritz> right, delegation only makes sense if you delegate *to* something

[20:12] <TreyHarris> Your instincts are right, I think; classes should generally be used for "has-a" relationships and roles should be used for "does" relationships. It would be very weird to create an attribute that "but"s a role just to delegate to it. It's less weird to do the same with a class

[20:12] *** zakharyas left
[20:13] *** cdg joined
[20:14] <TreyHarris> particularly since multiple inheritance opens up much more potential for clashes of things you're not meaning to pay any attention to, while taking on several roles does not (usually)

[20:15] <hahainternet> is there a form of Q (or other quoting) that allows multiline word splitting with comments?

[20:16] <hythm> Right, I  was just reading this few minutes ago, Role will throw compile time error for duplicate names ^^

[20:16] <hahainternet> actually i don't really care whether it splits words as i can do that trivially, but i'd like to comment some lines

[20:18] <haxmeister> TreyHarris: with javascript, css isn't even needed which is sad. I think it could be better if the role of javascript was scaled back a bit.

[20:19] <moritz> hahainternet: << .. >> should work

[20:19] <hahainternet> moritz: what's their name so i can read the docs?

[20:19] <moritz> m: say <<a b c␤# a comment here␤d e>>;

[20:19] <hahainternet> oh that's a lovely use of newline too

[20:20] <moritz> camelia takes ␤ in its input and translates it into real newlines

[20:20] <hahainternet> yeah, it solves an obvious problem very elegantly

[20:20] <hahainternet> but, what's the name of <<>> or is it on the quoting page and i missed it?

[20:21] <hahainternet> cheers, as usual perl6 exceeds expectations :)

[20:21] <moritz> the search box on docs.perl6.org did have a "<<>> quote" entry

[20:21] <hahainternet> noted

[20:22] <TreyHarris> haxmeister: well, as you noted, you could technically have a page consisting of nothing but javascript. but I don't think there's obvious ways to "scale that back". Unlike HTML and CSS, JS is a Turing-complete programming language, and its raison d'être is changing the DOM, which is munging what the literal HTML and CSS says, so.... *shrug*

[20:33] <haxmeister> just preventing the loading of new content by javascript would be helpful.. though I know a lot of people who would be bitterly dissappointed at me for mentioning that

[20:36] <TreyHarris> "preventing the loading of new content"? so search box autofill, mail, messaging and live-update apps that don't work by polled page reloading, alerting like on GitHub when the onsreen content has become invalid since it was loaded... you think getting rid of all those would be an improvement? JS would be limited to a glorified client-side form-sanitizer

[20:36] <TreyHarris> I think you're throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

[22:09] <hahainternet> i'm parsing a simple string in a grammar, where a token can be one of a small number of values, but case insensitive, the parsing is successful, but i'd like to recover the original case of the token that matched, rather than the input string

[22:09] <hahainternet> so for example, "HELLO" and "goodbye"

[22:10] <timotimo> you might have to have something like { make "HELLO" } and { make "goodbye" } in your token

[22:10] <timotimo> and then use .ast to recover that value

[22:10] <hahainternet> the token is currently just { :i <{@statements}> } so that's a slight problem

[22:11] <timotimo> ah

[22:11] <hahainternet> i assume i could use some fancy meta type stuff to programmatically add a bunch of tokens to a grammar

[22:11] <hahainternet> i guess that just shifts the problem to the TOP token however

[22:11] <timotimo> why do you <{@statements}> rather than just @statements?

[22:12] <hahainternet> because i didn't realise just @statements worked :)

[22:12] <timotimo> OK

[22:12] <timotimo> well, after the match succeeds you could grep through @statements for the matched value to find which one matched

[22:12] <timotimo> sounds terrible, but it'll do

[22:12] <hahainternet> i guess, that's a shame really

[22:13] <hahainternet> cheers for the help timotimo
