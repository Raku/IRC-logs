[00:07] <timotimo> did you get the message about your first message getting cut short?

[00:08] <timotimo> "at learning perl and comes the" were the last words

[00:10] <ShadowManu> oh, it got truncated: "(...) I was looking at learning perl and comes the question: Perl5 or 6?" I have no issues with being in the bleeding-edge and updating code (if it's worth).

[18:16] <AlexDaniel-> now I'm hunting for regressions, so I took all m: snippets from IRC logs

[18:16] <AlexDaniel-> and I run them on several rakudo versions and check for differences

[18:17] <TEttinger> yeah, I think the similar issue that affected clojurebot and the earlier lazybot has been fixed. On the lazybot I host, apparently you would have had access to remote code execution, within message size limits

[18:17] <AlexDaniel-> well, remote code execution is kinda the point of having an evalbot :)

[18:20] <AlexDaniel-> (I'm not too concerned because most of the filesystem is read-only for the bots, but precomp files and other stuff isn't, so it will disturb the bots a little bit)

[18:20] <TEttinger> if you can execute a file as another user maybe

[18:21] <TEttinger> JVM has stuff to run shell commands with privilege

[18:21] <AlexDaniel-> for that reason, for example, *ables no longer have RESTRICTED setting (it was worthless anyway), but please don't do crazy shit

[18:21] <TEttinger> yeah

[18:21] *** troys is now known as troys_

[18:22] <AlexDaniel-> as for the internet access, there was at least one time when we were bisecting IRC::Client on bisectable

[18:22] <AlexDaniel-> so it's super useful to have unrestricted bots, even though it's scary as f

[18:22] <wander> so now when we overload operator infix:<=, it doesn't work on ≤?

[18:25] <geekosaur> this is something of a known wart. it's a bit more widely visible than it used to be

[18:47] *** sergot left
[18:48] <geekosaur> wander, ideally the names infix:< <= > and infix:<< <= >> and infix:<≤> etc. should be aliases. instead they are separate definitions, *and* certain parts of the code expect to see only one canonical form for them.

[18:49] <geekosaur> I am not sure what's up with aliases, possibly they are intended to be implemented at some point but aren't yet.

[18:49] <geekosaur> the second problem I mentioned is harder because making the code handle any of the possible forms the name can take will make it very slow

[18:50] <geekosaur> given that you have to support both unicode and ascii versions along with any of multiple possible quoting formats, which end up being part of the name

[19:17] <wander> since what we care about is the operator form, s/infix:<≤>/infix< <= >/

[19:17] <HoboWithAShotgun> fricking smartmatch. %h ~~ $key doesn't work. It has to be $key ~~ %h

[19:17] <gfldex> jdv79: there is still Thread.start

[19:18] <wander> what zoffix did in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/6ec21cb473 is  `if ($name eq '&infix:<≤>') { $op.name: '&infix:«<=»' }`

[19:18] <[Coke]> You can write your own schedule, I think.

[19:18] <[Coke]> *er

[19:19] <geekosaur> HoboWithAShotgun, did you see my earlier remark about that?

[19:20] <wander> maybe definition should also be converted

[19:20] <geekosaur> ~~ CANNOT be commutative. (think of it this way, a subclass is not a superclass. so A ~~ B can't imply B ~~ A if B is a subclass of A)

[19:21] <geekosaur> wander, you are still missing the point that you can use any of umpteen different kinds of quoting

[19:22] <jdv79> i get a weird mutex error if i try to set initial_threads

[19:22] <jdv79> but i can still set max_threads in a new Scheduler like before the rework 

[19:22] <wander> isn't simply textual-substitution, but when deal with a operator definition it performs

[19:22] <jdv79> oh, its not public

[19:23] <jdv79> gah

[19:23] <geekosaur> infix:<≤> and infix:<<≤>> and infix:«≤» and infix:‹≤› are all supposed to be the same thing (and there's still other ways to write it)

[19:23] <wander> well

[19:23] <geekosaur> do you start to see the problem?

[19:24] <wander> so the fix doesn't work, right?

[19:24] <wander> it just deal with '&infix:<≤>'

[19:27] <wander> if we can reduce all forms of use into '&infix:<≤>', we shall be able to reduce all form of definition into one, says, standard form

[19:29] <jdv79> so tried to recompile with initial_threads set to 4 and got a lock error

[19:29] <jdv79> :(

[19:30] <ugexe> there have to be a certain number of threads initially, although i dont know what that number is

[19:30] <ugexe> 1 for gc for instance

[19:30] *** ryn1x left
[19:30] <jdv79> the default worker count is 1

[19:31] *** ryn1x joined
[19:31] <timotimo> yeah the MAX_THREADS is only the default for any scheduler created without that argument passed in code

[19:31] <jdv79> i think what's happening is that I'm piling (possibly dependant) work on the scheduler before it decides to start enough threads and it deadlocks

[19:31] <wander> convert the definition instead of substitute text

[19:31] <jdv79> or something like that 

[19:32] <timotimo> moarvm will start one thread for spesh and jit, and one thread for eventloopy things

[19:32] <jdv79> unless there's a better theory for why my test case only works if a second general worker is started 

[19:32] <ugexe> that doesn't explain the exception i see though

[19:33] <jdv79> i'm not sure that's necessarily related

[19:33] <jdv79> i don't everr get an exception here but the test passes and doesn't

[19:34] <ugexe> did you run the code exactly as is from that gist?

[19:35] <jdv79> yeah

[19:35] <ugexe> because it -is- slightly different in that the same perl6 instance would be managing every retry

[19:35] <yoleaux> 19:15Z <AlexDaniel-> Zoffix: regarding RT #131515, you say that it is not the right commit, even though it totally feels like it's exactly the right one. I'm too tired right now, but I've added [BISECTME] tag so that I'd get to it later. ⅕ of a step this time, but eventually we'll get it nailed

[19:36] <Zoffix> wander: convert definition to what?

[19:38] <Xliff> \o

[19:39] <Xliff> geekosaur: What mneumonic do you use to determine smartmatch order?

[19:39] <Xliff> I typically think of ~~ as one of "matches", "is" or "does".

[19:40] <Xliff> You could even use "in", but that's semantics.

[19:41] <Xliff> Ahh. That actually is better than what I've been using.

[19:41] <jdv79> if you go back to before the scheduler rework, say 2017.09, mmy test always passes

[19:41] <Zoffix> s/shuffling/shuttling/;

[19:42] <jdv79> but now i'm just repeating myself 

[19:42] <wander> seeing your fix `if ($name eq '&infix:<≤>') { $op.name: '&infix:«<=»' }`, I wonder if all ≤ calls have the form `&infix:<≤>`

[19:42] <wander> if so, we may write `if ($name eq infix:<≤>) { $op.name: 'infix:«<=»' }` "when dealing with multi operator definition"

[19:42] <jdv79> anyway, anyone have any ideas here?:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dbe5c79eeed3b3e456f7e872d146603d

[19:43] <Xliff> geekosaur: is .ACCEPTS nqp?

[19:43] <jdv79> all i did was change the # of initial_threads from 0 to 4

[19:43] <wander> premise, <= is the alias of ≤

[19:45] <geekosaur> m: say Int.ACCEPTS(3)

[19:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 7bea3a2dd: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[19:45] *** ryn1x left
[19:46] <geekosaur> ~~ is just shorthand for aliasing $_ to the left side and then invoking the ACCEPTS method of the right side with $_ as parameter

[19:46] <Xliff> kk

[19:46] <wander> Xliff, https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/ebac9feeb696f5f1774a3feb1ef10e8262e8e6f3/src/core/NQPMu.nqp#L86

[19:47] <geekosaur> so I guess I read ~~ as 'is ACCEPTed by'

[19:47] <Xliff> Which is a more conside way of how I was thinking about it. LOL.

[19:47] <Zoffix> wander: yeah, any way you write them will be cannonicalize to one form: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/7bea3a2dd/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L5023-L5039

[19:48] <Zoffix> wander: you can see it gets converted to infix:<≤> form if you dump AST: perl6 --target=ast -e 'infix:«≤»(4, rand)' and if you dump optimizer stage, you can see it gets converted: perl6 --target=optimize -e 'infix:«≤»(4, rand)'

[19:49] *** espadrine joined
[19:49] <Zoffix> wander: unsure what you mean by "`if ($name eq infix:<≤>) [...] "when dealing with multi operator definition""`. The `$name eq infix:<≤>` won't be valid code in the optiimizer

[19:55] <wander> Zoffix, since we are able to convert_unicode_op_to_ascii when optimize_call, can we convert_unicode_op_to_ascii when define_multi_sub?

[19:57] *** ryn1x joined
[20:00] <wander> then both definition and use of there ops are equivalent, so they are aliases

[20:01] <Zoffix> wander: probably yes. But I don't know how. I'm a n00b at this. lizmat++ proposed doing something like that when the commit when it, so maybe she know how. Prolly should watch out for how it works out with user defined ops. Unless we define all Unicode ops as strictly aliases for ASCII ops (prolly make sense). IIRC there as an `is alias` trait lizmat made in the past but it disn't make the cut

[20:02] <Zoffix> huggable: alias

[20:02] <huggable> Zoffix, Alias methods (with `aka` trait): https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2017-08-31#i_15093699  Condensed to an "also" trait: sub trait_mod:<is>(Method:D $m, :$also!) { my $c := $m.package; $c.^add_method($_,$m) for @$also }

[23:40] <[equa]> guess I can work around it by turning into a function that tests each regex in order, I guess

[23:41] *** araralonre__ left
[23:41] <BenGoldberg> Hmm, make that my $combined = qr/$a|$b/, since you want to match if any of them match.
