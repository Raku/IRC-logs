[00:00] <jnthn> Hurrah

[00:00] <thou> tbrowder, llfourn: I've re-merged the Untwine Pod commit and made a new pull request: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1300

[00:00] <jnthn> And just in time :)

[00:02] <thou> tbrowder, llfourn: I've verified that spec tests pass (modulo the changes needed to remove the unwanted "" contents).

[00:04] <thou> I guess it would be cleaner for llfourn to update their branch, so they get credit for the work. But if they're not available I'd like to move it forward if it gets positive reviews.

[00:06] <jnthn> Zoffix++ # highlighting tool to make posts look pretty :)

[01:24] <timotimo> tbrowder: you may be interested to know that "say" in nqp is actually not only the opcode but also a subroutine built-in to nqp (via its own setting)

[01:25] <timotimo> nqp-m: say(&say.HOW.name(&say))

[01:25] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT: «BOOTCode␤»

[01:25] <timotimo> well, that's not terribly enlightening, because BOOTCode is not what you'd find as the type of subroutines in rakudo land

[01:28] <tbrowder> timotimo: yes, i’ve used it bare (also print) but i haven’t seen it documented as a built-in and wasn’t sure it was always safe to use. 

[01:29] <timotimo> hah, you're right. there is places where it's not actually safe to use say, i stumbled upon that when i did some frighteningly internalsy hacking on nqp itself at one point

[01:30] <timotimo> or maybe what i'm thinking of was the bug with the grammar tracer module?

[01:44] *** cdg left
[01:44] <adu> I recently successfully installed Redox

[01:44] <tbrowder> counting down til christmas, lots of christmas cards to get out

[01:44] <tbrowder> what is Redox?

[01:45] <adu> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_(operating_system)

[01:47] <adu> Do you think anyone will ever write an OS in Perl6?

[01:52] <tbrowder> probably, just for the challenge if nothing else!

[01:54] <adu> I could see maybe writing it in nqp

[11:37] <lancew> Hi all, just looking for namespace advice for a module I have written. I was thinking of breaking this https://github.com/lancew/MyJudo/blob/master/lib/Judo.pm6 out of the application and making it a Module and extending it a bit. But had two questions, A) Would it just be "noise" as not sure how many people would ever use it. and B) If (and I do mean if) I submitted it for modules.perl6.org what namespace would you put it in?

[11:40] *** piojo_ joined
[11:41] *** cdg left
[11:42] *** geospeck left
[11:42] <timotimo> well, we do have the App:: namespace that's probably for that kind of thing?

[11:43] <teatime> hi lancew, thanks for thinking about contributing the the perl6 ecosystem :)

[11:43] <lancew> The P5 equivalent is https://metacpan.org/pod/Acme::MetaSyntactic::kodokan I guess (which to be fair I could just use right. :-) 

[11:44] <teatime> lancew: what is this data / perhaps some English comments?

[11:44] <timotimo> FWIW, even if you have the same name as someone else's module, you can still just :auth<cpan:LANCEW> or :auth<github:lancew> or whatever to get the right one

[11:44] <lancew> timotimo, not sure the Judo.pm6 is an "app"? It's a component I use in the app.

[11:45] * lancew goes off to explore the app namespace

[11:45] <timotimo> it can live under App::MyJudo::Judo or something

[11:46] <teatime> ah, so App:: is a convenient/welcoming place to claim a private namespace?

[11:46] <teatime> and collisions aren't a big deal

[11:46] <lancew> Oh I see. Yeah that makes more sense to me. :-)

[15:47] <yoleaux> 10:23Z <perlawhirl> Zoffix: fenced code blocks on github hilight properly if you use 'perl 6' instead of 'perl6'

[15:48] <Zoffix> perlawhirl: they don't. They get highlighted as Perl 5 code if you do that.

[15:51] <Zoffix> perlawhirl: compare the md.md file highlight with p5.pl and p6.p6 highlights: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/2faa177a2ea0745b54d8847d6f1f8294

[15:51] <Zoffix> It's supposed to be like p6.p6 highlight, but they broke it.

[16:09] <AlexDaniel> I've always thought that ```perl6 works just fine

[16:10] <AlexDaniel> hm, it no longer does :o

[16:12] <dmaestro> I've been having trouble with a number of corners of Rakudo* 2017.10 :-(

[16:12] <dmaestro> The last few previous star releases have "just worked" ...

[16:14] <dmaestro> Here's the latest, trying to install on linux. The following test fails (t/02-rakudo/repl.t):

[16:15] <dmaestro> # uint8 lexical type encountered while building context iterator

[16:15] *** AlexDaniel left
[16:16] <dmaestro> not ok 33 - Using native numeric types does not break REPL # TODO RT#127933

[16:16] <synopsebot> RT#127933 [open]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127933 [REPL] int# bug

[16:16] <dmaestro> Ooops - I see it's TODO and it passed the individual test - thought that was the one that broke 'make test' ?

[16:17] <dmaestro> looking again ...

[16:19] <dmaestro> Hmm ... transient failure I guess ....

[18:20] <Ulti> has anyone used q:x with the time command? I've tried putting in my command a redirection of stderr to stdout around the time which works on the shell but q:x doesnt appear to capture the output

[18:24] <Ulti> also this is the macOS time which doesn't have the -o option :(

[18:40] <geekosaur> Ulti, beware that bash has a time builtin that overrides the executable... and you need to redirect the *shell's* stderr to capture its output

[18:42] *** darutoko left
[18:43] <geekosaur> actually I am not sure which one q:x will run there

[18:44] <geekosaur> it should be using /bin/sh but that might be a different bash build with different options

[18:44] <geekosaur> (on os x it almost certainly will be)

[18:45] <timotimo> i don't think we have a way to capture the output of something run by the shell but not what the shell outputs

[18:45] <geekosaur> actually I thinkt hat's not it because it worked from a command line apparentlu

[18:46] <geekosaur> although at worst 'exec 2>&1; ...' should handle it

[20:02] <mspo> examples link isn't https

[20:04] <mspo> and why does this page exist with a link on the footer of perl6.org?  (under STD.pm - official Perl6 grammar)

[20:05] <mspo> "viv ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5) is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to build. It is actively developed along with STD. "

[20:05] <mspo> " Note: STD and viv aren't actively developed any more "

[20:06] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: aeca866856 | (Moritz Lenz)++ | includes/footer

[20:06] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: remove STD link from footer

[20:06] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: 

[20:06] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: it is not that relevante anymore

[20:06] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: review: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/commit/aeca866856

[20:07] <mspo> 'Everything that can't be categorized otherwise fits into the "Whatever" slot, or as the Perl 6 hacker would write it, *.'

[20:07] <mspo> that * should be a link

[20:07] <mspo> on https://perl6.org/whatever/

[20:07] <mspo> did someone stard a lang server for perl6 yet?

[20:08] <DrForr> What do you mean by 'language server'?

[20:09] <mspo> http://langserver.org/

[20:09] <mspo> isn't like a daemon a text editor can talk to to get access to the AST and stuff

[20:09] <mspo> vim (new versions), neovim, and vscode can all use it (at least)

[20:10] <DrForr> I don't see Perl on the list, either 5 or 6, so I think your answer is 'no'.

[20:11] <DrForr> Feel free to implement your own :)

[20:12] <moritz> mspo: to which/whose TODO list?

[20:12] <DrForr> There's a "most wanted" file in the ecosystem, feel free to add it :)

[20:17] <DrForr> I'm probably wrong. I know there's a most_wanted.txt file somewhere there.
