[00:33] <Geth> ¦ modules.perl6.org:     to server side

[00:33] <Geth> ¦ modules.perl6.org: - Start with non-weak tags visible by default instead of starting

[00:33] <Geth> ¦ modules.perl6.org:     them all hidden and showing them with JS after load

[00:33] <Geth> ¦ modules.perl6.org: - If weak tag is active, do not hide weak tags either

[00:33] <Geth> ¦ modules.perl6.org: - If active tag is clicked, assume user wants to go back to all tags

[12:52] <DrForr> s/contributor/alien/ :)

[12:53] <masak> ;)

[12:54] <DrForr> Any Unicode suggestions? I'm already showing that ½τ == π works (with \c[INVISIBLE TIMES])...

[12:54] <raschipi> masak: please don't try to kill Perl6.

[12:55] *** bjz joined
[12:55] *** itaipu joined
[12:55] <masak> raschipi: unexpected reply. hold on, I'll make a note here "try not to kill Perl 6"... :P

[12:56] <raschipi> I'm all in favor of a contributor agreement, just not that one. That one is toxic.

[12:56] <masak> DrForr: maybe mention that any use of invisible characters in source code is automatically sinful :P

[12:57] <raschipi> How is one supposed to program without spaces or newlines?

[12:57] <masak> raschipi: I feel like there's some background information here I should know about but don't

[12:57] <DrForr> Nearly fell out of my chair. I'm watching CinemaSins.

[12:57] <masak> raschipi: those two get some kind of exception

[12:58] <raschipi> Let me get a coffee first, then I will tell you the drama.

[12:58] <masak> don't know if I should look forward to the story or not

[12:59] <raschipi> Well, it's simple, that contributor agreement was created to ALLOW harassement, not to stop it. As long as it's the politically correct kind of harassment, of course.

[13:01] <masak> I'm no expert, but I hear that kind of argument sometimes at the edges of my Twitter feed. often together with phrases like "social justice warrior" and "ethics in journalism"

[13:01] *** robertle joined
[13:02] * sjn reads masak's link

[13:02] <raschipi> I'm just trying to avoid drama, from any side.

[13:02] <masak> raschipi: you have been most civil so far. that is appreciated.

[13:02] <masak> I'm not sure "avoid drama from any side" is the right metric, short-term

[13:03] <masak> to optimize for, I mean

[13:03] * masak looks forward to hearing what sjn thinks

[13:03] <raschipi> Like I said, I'm in favor of a contributor agreement, but one that doesn't bring the king of baggage that one brings.

[13:03] <masak> well, it's good to know that according to at least some people, it has baggage

[13:03] <raschipi> I have to do something, we will talk more later.

[13:04] <masak> I wasn't necessarily thinking of adopting it so much as being inspired by it, perhaps

[13:04] <sjn> Hm. A cursory look at it already shows a few problems.. :-(

[13:04] <DrForr> Contributor agreement... sigh.

[13:13] <lucs> I'm amazed that all these covenants and other codes of conduct are popping up all over the place.

[13:14] <lucs> It looks like at least a whole generation forgot or was not taught or ignores a simple concept:

[13:14] <lucs> Behave

[13:14] <sjn> masak: First impression; it's not horribly bad; maybe little is said about how the document evolves, and it leaves terms like "appropriate", "fair", "offensive" and "inappropriate" to be defined by the project maintainers... :-\

[13:15] <masak> lucs: I've come to think that "behave" isn't enough and that an explicit Code of Conduct can be better than none

[13:15] <masak> sjn: well, take something like the Perl 5 IRC ecosystem

[13:15] <lucs> masak: Yes, people appear not to know what behave means.

[13:15] <masak> lucs: I don't think it's because we've left some lovely Golden Age, though

[13:16] <masak> lucs: I think this is what happens when communities grow and mature

[13:16] <jast> personally, the only reason I'm not put off by the language in Codes of Conduct is that I don't read them and rely on my common sense being enough

[13:16] <masak> sjn: people like mst perform a community service by intervening when someone acts in a trolling way, kicking and banning as needed

[13:17] <DrEeevil> I find them very confusing

[13:17] <masak> sjn: it's a job I don't imagine is very fulfilling, but it's needed

[13:17] <DrEeevil> most are badly worded and arbitrary, which makes enforcement very ugly

[13:17] <sjn> yeah

[13:17] <jast> my point is that you can just as easily intervene when there is no code of conduct

[13:17] <masak> sjn: I get the impression that "mst and his clique" end up getting a lot of hate/flames because of it

[13:17] <masak> sjn: but I'd rather they keep cleaning up obvious trolls than not

[13:18] <masak> (and rather them than me, too) :/

[13:18] <sjn> To me the text looks like the type of ad-hoc "legal" document that might curb certain behaviour, but at the cost of taking away attention from just helping eachother with the everyday community work

[13:18] <masak> jast: sure, of course

[13:18] <jast> at the core is this: put up a document of rules and you end up getting a legal system developed around it, whether you want one or not

[13:19] <masak> Perl 6's one venture into the code-of-conduct thing was a document that can be summarized as "just be level-headed and reasonable, OK? give people the benefit of the doubt and don't yell"

[13:19] <jast> that sounds reasonable ;)

[13:19] <masak> well

[13:19] <sjn> masak: I like the Reasonable Person Principle

[13:20] <masak> then the author of that document went and had a big argument with someone on the channel

[13:20] <masak> and wouldn't calm down or listen to arguments

[13:20] <DrEeevil> jast: you might end up with an acute infection of bureaucrats ;)

[13:20] <masak> and ended up leaving the community

[13:21] <masak> not sure a different code-of-conduct could've prevented that, but...

[13:21] <sjn> http://www.irc.perl.org/reasonable_person.html

[13:21] <jast> definitely not

[13:21] <masak> ...it made me conclude that "just be reasonable" isn't always enough

[13:21] <jast> that seems to me like inverse logic

[13:22] <jast> "the document did not prevent the behaviour it was meant to highlight as being bad, therefore it's not sufficient"

[13:22] <jast> if that's your standard, no document will achieve it

[13:22] <masak> more like "the author of the document couldn't live up to the guideline outlined in the document"

[13:23] <jast> that's a failure of the author, not of the document

[13:23] <masak> more the former than the latter, yes

[13:23] <masak> anyway, I see what you're saying

[13:23] <masak> I'm still thinking about all these things

[13:24] <masak> still not convinced either way

[13:24] <jast> apart from that, let's look at this from another angle. if you have a document, prominently advertised, that keeps talking about abuse and harassment and insults and trolling, what kind of impression does that create about what are the most central problems to your project?

[13:24] *** bjz_ joined
[13:24] *** bjz left
[13:24] <jast> putting up a set of rules like that implies: "this is the behaviour we anticipate having to deal with"

[13:25] <jast> I don't know about you, but to me that kind of implication doesn't actually seem like something that creates positivity

[13:25] <kurahaupo__> jast: we should anticipate dealing with it, because it happens everywhere. But it could focus more on education and amicable resolution.

[13:26] <DrEeevil> even worse: since it defines unacceptable behaviour people will argue that everything else is acceptable, and there's subjective stuff like "being offended"

[13:26] <b2gills> Just looking at the second paragraph saying “… thoughtless use of pronouns, assumptions of gender, …” has put me off of it.

[13:26] <DrEeevil> ... now you have more problems ;)

[13:26] <kurahaupo__> no, the last item is "whatever else would not be acceptable in a professional environment"

[13:27] <jast> kurahaupo__: definitely anticipate that it's going to happen, but not give it so much focus that it seems like the *expected* thing to happen

[13:27] <b2gills> Has the document that ShimmerFairy created been put into a prominent place yet

[13:27] <DrEeevil> kurahaupo__: that is difficult - I've worked in very weird but professional environments

[13:27] <kurahaupo__> It would be nice to add some words like "we hope it doesn't come to this but..."

[13:27] <jast> how often do you see stores put up a prominent sign saying, "please do not insult our employees"?

[13:28] <jast> putting up that sign will bias your customers in ways that probably aren't going to help you

[13:28] <masak> there's something about that argument I don't exactly like

[13:28] <masak> can't put my finger on it, but...

[13:29] <b2gills> Just go to a construction site, and listen.

[13:29] <masak> using a similar argument, you could never really say something like "we expect people not to be jerks"

[13:29] <jast> oh, it's a terrible argument, because nobody likes for this to be going on, but it does

[13:29] <jast> (go on)

[13:29] <masak> that's the thing, though

[13:29] <masak> for years, the Perl 6 community has been a source of joy and happiness for me, because people are largely nice

[13:29] <masak> I'd like for it to stay that way

[13:30] <jast> quite understandable :)

[13:30] <masak> but I also know that when communities grow and mature, they grow less polite and the discourse deteriorates

[13:30] <jast> documents don't fix that, people do

[13:31] <jast> a community needs people who reinforce positive behaviour, and swift action against unreasonable people

[13:31] <masak> ok, that's something I can agree with

[13:32] <b2gills> Well reasonable interpersonally, Larry is quite unreasonable, otherwise he wouldn't have come up with Perl 6 … or even Perl in general

[13:32] <jast> unreasonable in terms of conflicts with others, I mean

[13:33] <jast> there's nothing wrong with having unusual ideas and pursuing them, but if you start attacking others over it, something's wrong

[13:34] *** lukaramu_ joined
[13:35] <jast> I guess it boils down to: differences in opinion/values are good, attacks over differences in opinion/values are not

[13:36] <masak> but that's so generic that virtually anyone would agree

[13:36] <masak> even trolls

[13:37] <IOninja> masak, imo these codes of conduct are the one sure way to create a hostile environment. The safe people won't even bother reading them and the trolls will just use them to troll everyone. The crucial point their near universally miss is: whom to contact in private to resolve serious issue... "This guy keeps messaging me and asking for nudes; what do I do?" "This person keeps closing my Issues because they

[13:37] <IOninja> don't like that I'm gay. Who do I talk to?" "This person keeps posting my personal information. How do I stop them?" Those are the real problems and I'm yet to see a CoC that doesn't just stupidly enumerate "unwanted behaviours".

[13:37] <jast> I don't think so. many (not all, but this wasn't meant to be the One Golden Rule) trolls are, quite obviously, very much in favour of attacking people

[13:37] <masak> I find the argument "codes of conduct are what creates a hostile environment" totally bizarre

[13:38] *** lukaramu left
[13:38] <jast> personally I think that argument overstates things a bit

[13:38] <masak> but I do agree on the importance of addressing those crucial points

[13:38] <DrEeevil> masak: you've not seen an infection of bureaucrats and legalistic trolls? very easy to be a pain in the ass while within the rules, while everyone who attacks you oversteps them

[13:38] <jast> it's true that some people like doing nasty things with detailed sets of rules

[13:38] <jast> and those people WILL cause you serious issues if you give them that kind of ruleset

[13:39] <IOninja> masak, oh yeah? Look up the day when Mojolicious implemented code of conduct and read their channel log. It's nothing but incessant trolling about what does and does not constitute appropriate

[13:40] <IOninja> And the rest is silence, because people are utterly confused about whethet they can talk about $X or not

[13:40] <masak> DrEeevil: haven't seen, no. but it does sound like some of Wikipedia's problems.

[13:41] *** wamba joined
[13:41] <masak> anyway, DrEeevil and IOninja: interesting feedback. thank you.

[13:41] <DrEeevil> masak: augh. yeah, wikipedia is difficult ... 

[13:41] <kurahaupo__> I think I like the 3-sentence version: This project runs on good will, so we must all tend and nurture the community. If something you do (or neglect) offends or discomodes another member of the community, it is expected that you will apologize, whether or not you intended it and whether or not you think that taking offense was a reasonable response. And though we sincerely hope it never comes to it, anyone whose activities cause distress may be excl

[13:42] <jast> FWIW, here's what the #git channel (avg. ~1250 users) has in terms of a "code of conduct":

[13:42] <jast> A sense of community thrives on people connecting on a personal level, if even just very slightly. Personally, I like the idea that Git developers and users can be one big chosen family, if you'll forgive the needlessly cheesy metaphor. It doesn't matter if you only visit us for a few minutes, or stick around for years! Of course there will always be wildly different people in that family, and all of us won't hit it off equally well, but that's okay! We're pretty go

[13:42] <jast> full disclosure: I wrote that

[13:42] *** hlafarge joined
[13:42] <IOninja> masak, IME it's the regulars who are often the source of hostile tone. They start getting abusive but no one steps up to tell them to stfu because they got ops, or they contributed a billion commits. 

[13:42] <DrEeevil> kurahaupo__: that is very badly phrased

[13:43] <jast> kurahaupo__: your message got cut off at "distress may be excl"

[13:43] <masak> jast: your message got cut off at "We're pretty go"

[13:43] <jast> [...] We're pretty good at disagreeing without killing each other... not even slightly. (We've argued about text editors and we're still here!)

[13:43] <kurahaupo__> DrEeevil: well, it's a work in progress

[13:44] <kurahaupo__> jast:  cat>|

[13:44] <jast> and here's #git's message to regulars: https://jk.gs/git/helping.html

[13:44] <jast> it's not perfectly applicable to a project with a larger scope than just "support", of course

[13:44] <DrEeevil> kurahaupo__: "it is expected that you will apologize" ... that's something I wouldn't accept

[13:45] <DrEeevil> ("I'm offended that you feel offended. Now whose offense is more important?")

[13:47] <jast> in any case, I find it very valuable to have a light-hearted tone in these things, especially if you want light-hearted interactions in the project ;)

[13:47] <IOninja> masak, and IME, regulars start getting abusive when they're burnt out but are still not taking a break and try to field questions. So they start getting annoyed by "stupid questions" or users not responding fast enough. In fact, I think Code of Burn Out would be more effective than any CoC.

[13:48] <jast> yeah, that's what my helping.html was about... it focuses on reducing burn out and frustration when dealing with newcomers

[13:48] <raschipi> kurahaupo__: That takes away all the power apologies have.

[13:50] <jast> and the thing IOninja mentioned, about core contributors brushing off/rejecting contributions from some contributors, is a problem that needs a rather delicate discussion between that person and other core contributors... it's basically a responsibility all the most visible project members have

[17:21] <tadzik> yeah, I was worried about that

[17:21] <IOninja> No one reads them anyway. The common two reasons they get violated are: cultural differences and people just being assholes. And instead of communicating the issues like humans, people throw CoCs at each other and you always have 1 person who acts as a policeman and 1 person who's automatically in the defensive mode. And arguing ensues whether the policeman is applying the written law correctly and whether the

[17:32] <IOninja> I think places where CoCs work aren't so much about the CoCs' content but about people applying them. There's a big difference between "We try to keep an inclusive and professional atmosphere in the channel. Would you mind trying to avoid using coarse language?" and "First warning! No swearing. Don't you see rules in the TOPIC?"

[17:34] <tadzik> honest question, where have you seen the latter?

[17:35] * AlexDaniel apologizes and corrects himself: “I see you people are having fun here”

[17:35] <geekosaur> I've seen it in a number of IRC channels

[17:35] <tadzik> (not literally of course, but this sort of attitude)

[17:35] <geekosaur> and, for what it's worth, the Haskell ops are big fans of the former over the latter

[17:35] <tadzik> *shudder*

[18:20] <IOninja> Guest78040: it's probably just an outdated README. People use `zef` these days.

[18:20] <IOninja> buggable: eco zef

[18:20] <buggable> IOninja, zef 'It's like [cpanm] wearing high heels with a tracksuit': https://github.com/ugexe/zef

[18:21] <timotimo> that makes sense

[18:21] <IOninja> Guest78040: I think it's included with latest Rakudo Star, so you may already have it. If not, ^ that link has bootstrapping instructions

[18:22] <Guest78040> zef gives me an error when running msys shell because no script file is there. zef works under powershell because perl6.bat is in path

[18:22] <IOninja> No idea, sorry. I've never even heard of msys shell

[18:22] *** nightfrog joined
[18:23] <Guest78040> msys2 shell

[18:23] <Guest78040> basically msys2 is mingw bash port for windows 7 & 10

[18:24] <IOninja> Is that the "Ubuntu on Windows" stuff?

[18:24] <jonadab> No.

[18:24] <IOninja> Ok

[18:24] <Guest78040> trying not to need a virtual machine all the time, like Ubunto on Windows

[18:24] <raschipi> timotimo: I have seen those people that insist transgender people are sick to actually cooperate a lot with them sometimes. Transgender activists want medical care to be paid by the government to help transgender kids just kicked out of home. They are actually closer than one would suppose at first.

[18:25] <jonadab> msys has been around a while (not as long as Cygwin).

[18:25] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:26] <jonadab> The subsystem for Ten is superior in most respects but requires that you be running Ten, which a lot of folks don't want to do because of the UI changes.

[18:26] <Guest78040> transgender kids are high risk of suicide, that is one good reason they need a lot of help. without a lot of help, they might not survive.

[18:26] <timotimo> that makes sense; i was thinking of "just mentally ill", though. people who say that would also tell them to "just get over it" or it's "just in your head", though. at least that's my expectation

[18:27] <timotimo> no doubt about them needing help

[18:30] <Guest78040> but msys2 cant find perl6 in path because it is a .bat file. I need to find a script without the .bat and written in bash not microsoft

[18:36] <timotimo> andrzejku: what kind of slow are you experiencing?

[18:36] <timotimo> maybe you need to turn hardware virtualization on in your BIOS, for example

[18:37] <timotimo> or maybe the slowness is just downloading installation media or prebuilt images or what

[18:37] <andrzejku> timotimo no it is like i pass vagrant command

[18:38] <andrzejku> and i even need to wait for help output

[18:38] <timotimo> oh, huh

[18:38] <timotimo> what does "time" say? is there a lot of time spent in "system", or is it all "user"?

[18:38] <andrzejku> timotimo wait I will try to analyze it

[18:39] <timotimo> i've actually got to go AFK for a bit anyway. i hope you can figure it out!

[18:39] <andrzejku> it is like 1 second

[18:39] <andrzejku> to wait

[18:40] <timotimo> it's 0.54s on my machine, 0.04s system time

[18:41] <timotimo> so yeah

[18:41] <timotimo> i guess that's expected? maybe it's the language it's written in. ruby, right?

[18:41] <andrzejku> yep

[18:41] <andrzejku> timotimo however as I know perl6 is slower than ruby

[18:41] <andrzejku> so I shouldn't complain for that

[18:41] <timotimo> a bit

[18:42] <timotimo> i suppose it depends on what vagrant does, exactly. for example, does it have a mechanism that allows plugins to put new subcommands in?

[18:42] *** mcmillhj joined
[18:43] <andrzejku> nevermind

[18:43] <timotimo> that'd mean it'd have to look through whatever module installation/registration mechanism they have

[18:43] <andrzejku> anyone

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> yes

[18:44] <andrzejku> AlexDaniel for which language?

[18:45] <AlexDaniel> andrzejku: for almost everything, actually

[18:46] <andrzejku> AlexDaniel nice I know only a bit emacs

[18:46] <andrzejku> AlexDaniel but I think to use it more, for C++

[18:48] <andrzejku> AlexDaniel would you lie to stay my emacs mentor?

[21:22] <sena_kun> LR parsers are hard to deal with by humans, afaik. LL is much easier to understand, though less efficient. Hence yacc/bison/etc.

[21:24] <bazzaar> I'd appreciate if someone could take a quick look and say why 'Cash' literal seems to have the observed effect

[21:25] *** jjido left
[21:26] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: ok, so what's exactly unexpected?

[21:27] <AlexDaniel> ah

[21:28] <bazzaar> AlexDaniel: the result is down at the bottom of the pastebin , :Cash(....) is unexpected (for me)

[21:28] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: interesting. Seems like it's just a pair that's .perl-ified differently

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> m: say ("Cash Flow" => ["48.070000", "£1.000000", "£48.07", "1.69\%"]).perl

[21:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 79f268: OUTPUT: «"Cash Flow" => ["48.070000", "£1.000000", "£48.07", "1.69\%"]␤»

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> m: say ("Cash-Flow" => ["48.070000", "£1.000000", "£48.07", "1.69\%"]).perl

[21:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 79f268: OUTPUT: «:Cash-Flow(["48.070000", "£1.000000", "£48.07", "1.69\%"])␤»

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: ↑

[21:29] <bazzaar> I wondered if Cash is a reserved word?

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> no

[21:29] *** Cabanossi left
[21:29] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: it's just that .perl is smart enough in this case to dump it slightly differently

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> m: say (hello => world).perl

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 79f268: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    world used at line 1. Did you mean 'words'?␤␤»

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> m: say (‘hello’ => ‘world’).perl

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 79f268: OUTPUT: «:hello("world")␤»

[21:30] <AlexDaniel> m: say (‘hello with a space’ => ‘world’).perl

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 79f268: OUTPUT: «"hello with a space" => "world"␤»

[21:32] *** Cabanossi joined
[21:32] <sena_kun> well, now I didn't get it. What is the difference between those two lines? They seem completely the same for me, though diff shows that `("Cash-Flow"` part is different.

[21:33] <bazzaar> AlexDaniel: aah, ok ... so false alarm right, just different notations for <pair> for keys with or without a space?

[21:33] *** Sound joined
[21:33] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: the difference is that ｢:hello foo("world")｣ is not a valid perl6 syntax

[21:33] <sena_kun> ah, I'm stupid, nevermind.

[21:33] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, I've noticed the space now, right. Thanks.

[21:33] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: yes

[21:34] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: there is a list of different ways to write pairs here: https://docs.perl6.org/type/Pair

[21:34] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: in theory, .perl can use any of them, as long as it is valid code :)

[21:34] <bazzaar> AlexDaniel: thanks for clearing that up, I'd have been staring at that for the next month of Sundays :)

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: if want to output this for users, it is probably better to stringify it yourself the way you want

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: I don't think we even have any guarantees as to what .perl will give exactly, so it may change

[21:37] <bazzaar> AlexDaniel: thanks for the advice, I will look into doing just that :)

[22:54] <ugexe> IOninja: zef does not need git on windows technically. But the ecosystem lists all source-url as .git links, so in practice yes you do

[22:55] <ugexe> if they edited the package list to change the github urls to github tar.gz urls then it would work without git

[22:56] <IOninja> ugexe: not all, it normalizes URLs but doesn't change protocol. 

[22:56] <IOninja> ugexe: it wouldn't need git if they were https:// URLs, correct?

[22:56] <ugexe> it still uses git for those as well

[22:56] <IOninja> Oh, OK.

[22:57] <hobbs> if they're https urls of git repos, it does :)

[22:57] <timotimo> does our meta.json format have some way to say "use any of these URLs to fetch the source"?

[22:57] <IOninja> ugexe: It could just download .zip file instead, no?

[22:58] <IOninja> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-WWW/archive/master.zip

[22:58] <ugexe> IOninja: yes, but if zef is supposed to guess that stuff then it needs logic on a per-git-server basis

[22:58] <IOninja> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-WWW/archive/cfb407192f8a19151f2d0d47567f3662dc5db475.zip

[22:58] <ugexe> e.g. i doubt mangling the urls to the archive is the same got bitbucket, gitlab, etc

[22:58] <IOninja> Seems a branch/SHA can be used.

[22:59] <ugexe> yeah, thats how tbrowder versions his modules in the ecosystem

[22:59] *** cibs left
[22:59] <timotimo> hm? how?

[22:59] <timotimo> putting a link to the tagged zipfile into the source url?

[22:59] <ugexe> you link the source-url in your meta file to the archive .tar.gz, and then link the meta6.json from that commit to the ecosystem alongside other versions

[23:00] <IOninja> ugexe: are you open to people implementing these URL manglers and submitting a PR?

[23:00] <IOninja> Feels like even if just GitHub were implemented that'd cover like 95% of our ecosystem

[23:00] *** dct left
[23:01] *** cibs joined
[23:02] <ugexe> yeah I would, but im not sure where that logic can be cleanly used

[23:02] <IOninja> Cool.

[23:02] <ugexe> but its easier to just mangle an ecosystem packagelist.json

[23:03] <IOninja> .oO( make ecosystem figure this out.... )

[23:03] <IOninja> Cool. I'll add this to my todo list to take a crack at then :) In May, unless someone beats me to it.

[23:29] <ugexe> (on windows that would also have `,pswebrequest]` for instance)

[23:29] <ugexe> although I think zef invokes wget and curl in a way that their powershell aliases work
