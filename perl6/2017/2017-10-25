[08:54] *** wamba joined
[08:54] <wander> why not add <.ws> at the beginning of rules automatically?

[08:55] <wander> it's what people want it to do, i think

[08:55] <moritz> no

[08:55] <moritz> <.ws> terminates LTM

[08:55] <moritz> which is why it tends to be a bad idea to parse it at the start

[08:56] <moritz> so the common wisdom is to parse whitespace at the end of each rule

[08:56] <moritz> and add a single <.ws> call inside TOP

[08:57] *** ccntrq joined
[08:58] <wander> how it terminates LTM?

[08:59] <moritz> the default ws uses ||, which is sequential

[08:59] <moritz> https://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Longest-token_matching

[08:59] <timotimo> also default ws has a <ww> in it, doesn't it?

[08:59] <timotimo> no, not ww

[08:59] <timotimo> a look-around assertion

[09:00] <moritz> <!ww> \s*

[09:00] <moritz> and ww uses ||, iirc

[12:55] <jast> at least not easily. a Sufficiently Smart Compiler (tm) can, of course, add memoization

[12:58] *** Cabanossi left

[13:06] <moritz> no

[13:06] <raschipi> what does it do, then?

[13:06] <moritz> it gives the optimizer a hint that it's allowed to compile-time-evaluate it if the arguments are known at compile time too

[13:06] <raschipi> right

[13:06] *** cdg joined
[13:07] <raschipi> thanks 

[13:07] <moritz> but there is no hard promise that an "is pure" will always inline, or that indeed that is the only semantics attached to it

[13:09] <HoboWithAShotgun> i just benchmarked the fact function above with compile time known arguments with and without pure

[13:09] <HoboWithAShotgun> no difference

[13:14] *** bdmatatu left
[13:22] <[Coke]> there isn't a memoized in p6, I don't think. (just cached)

[13:23] <HoboWithAShotgun> ok so apparently is cached and recursion don't like each other. https://hastebin.com/gemeviqiba.pl

[13:23] <HoboWithAShotgun> also, in that code, when i replace cached by pure, the pure version is reproducably 30% slower

[13:25] <perlpilot> that makes some sense at least.   You've lied to the compiler and in believing you, it does extra work  :)

[13:26] <HoboWithAShotgun> why lie? the sub has no side effects so it is "pure"

[13:27] *** Cabanossi left
[13:27] <HoboWithAShotgun> oh, "always produce the same output" not "always produce the same output (per given input"

[13:28] <raschipi> no, it's for the same input, but the input has to be known at compile time

[13:30] *** Cabanossi joined
[13:31] <HoboWithAShotgun> mmh, so an iterative solution should be faster here, because then the compiler could see the 20 and optimize, rather than recurse down to 2

[13:36] <perlpilot> HoboWithAShotgun: "is cached" is almost specifically for recursion.   I think it's that "is cached" and multi subs don't get along.

[13:50] <perlpilot> Maybe we should  throw a NYI error like we do for methods, but I don't know off the top of my head how to determine if a routine is a multi or not.

[15:01] <jdv79> there's no bytes method on Str?

[15:02] <[Coke]> which bytes would you expect?

[15:03] <sena_kun> .encode('utf-8') you want

[15:03] <jdv79> i want the real size

[15:04] <jdv79> ok

[15:05] <raschipi> doesn't make sense to talk about bytes without specifying the encoding.

[15:05] <[Coke]> .NFC, .NFD might also be of interest.

[15:05] <jdv79> yeah, just utf8
