[02:32] <samcv> ok so what is the best way to compare elements of two arrays

[02:32] <samcv> that are almost identical but may have one or two words in different spots

[02:32] <samcv> well elements, elements are words but. that's beside most of the point

[02:33] <samcv> i simplified way wuold be to just count how many of each element exist, but order is important

[02:34] <samcv> but i mostly want to know at what indexes one has additional elements compare dto the other or if the element is different

[02:34] *** bjz joined
[02:36] <BenGoldberg> samcv, Find a good string similarity algorithm, then change it to arrays of strings instead of arrays of chars.

[02:36] <samcv> hm

[02:36] <samcv> thanks

[02:37] <samcv> technically i need to compare similarity of two documents by words

[02:37] <BenGoldberg> Looking for plagarism?

[02:37] <samcv> no checking licenses

[02:37] <samcv> and yes i know tools exist for this

[02:38] <samcv> though maybe i'm making a module right now and don't know it ;)

[02:39] <samcv> spdx has a json of all the license text's. so i need to compare the documents not regarding whitespace or case

[02:39] <samcv> but punctuation matters

[02:39] *** geekosaur left
[02:39] *** geekosaur joined
[02:41] * BenGoldberg wonders whether a plagiarism detector might actually be the right tool for the job ;)

[02:41] <samcv> and people often put in random copyrgiht lines, sometimes at the end sometimes at the end or other text, so would be nice if it could tell you "oh this is the part that differs: 'copyright 2005 some persons name here and associates\nSome random other line here someone could add in"

[02:41] <samcv> maybe

[02:41] <samcv> but... it needs to be the right order of the words

[02:41] <samcv> but that might work maybe. but it's critical that ALL the matching sections have the right order and not new words added in

[02:41] <BenGoldberg> Normalizing whitespace and capitalization is the easiest part.

[02:42] <samcv> whereas that's common in plagarism and they are plagarizing as much if they add one word extra or not

[02:42] <samcv> yes of course

[02:42] <samcv> do we have a plagarism detector module ;)

[02:43] <samcv> BenGoldberg, i may take the approach of making a bag for every license. then taking my unknown license document and finding which bag is closest by the words it contains

[02:43] <samcv> then it has the best match, and then checks it for ordering of words etc

[02:44] <japh_com> is it possible to get a list of all of the classes/modules that are loaded in memory? something akin to ".^methods(:all)" but for all of the classes that are loaded... I'm assuming this has to be done at the NQP or maybe Metamodel level... Working on a debugger ui...

[02:44] <samcv> but it's important to be able to tell the user running the program which lines differ and it's not like "This is not the license of my software project. Copyright foo bar"

[02:44] <samcv> and it detects it as the project being that license. would be not good

[02:44] *** cyphase left
[02:44] <samcv> that would be nice japh_com let me know. there is some way maybe

[02:46] <BenGoldberg> Maybe a Bayesian classifier?

[02:46] <samcv> well. i mean i want to get back the words which are different between the two

[02:46] <samcv> would that do that

[02:47] <samcv> or you mean for comparing the bags

[02:47] <MasterDuke_> japh_com: have you looked at jnthn's heap profile analyzer?

[02:47] <kurahaupo_> samcv: sounds like the sort of thing that would be easily thwarted by a global search-and-replace with some synonyms

[02:47] <samcv> what would kurahaupo_ 

[02:47] <samcv> uh

[02:47] <samcv> well.

[02:47] <samcv> how does that defeat it i don't see

[02:48] <samcv> if they alter the text of the license...

[02:48] <samcv> also  there are guidlines for certain words which are equivilant like en_GB and en_US

[02:49] <japh_com> @MasterDuke_ Great suggestion. Checking jonathan's heap profile analyzer code now :-)

[02:49] <BenGoldberg> kurahaupo_, We're assuming that the people in whose code (or docs) these liscences are embeded aren't deliberately making it harder for readers to identify which license it is.

[02:49] <samcv> if you scroll down here to section 8.

[02:49] <samcv> https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines gives guidelines for words which are the same

[06:36] <timotimo> yes

[06:36] <samcv> if i clone the git, and zef install . all is fine

[06:36] <timotimo> you see, it has a "mi6" and a "mi6.bat"

[06:36] <timotimo> the mi6.bat contains only that exact line

[06:36] <samcv> :\

[06:37] <samcv> i do not use windows

[06:37] <timotimo> i expect zef is stripping extensions for binary scripts

[06:37] <timotimo> and just installs one after the other, thus overwriting mi6 with mi6.bat

[06:37] <timotimo> the solution is to not have two files with the same basename in bin/

[06:37] <timotimo> is there not yet an issue in the mi6 repo?

[08:14] <masak> IIUC, blippy (who asked the SO question) is aiming to get the program text out of the $expr AST argument being passed

[08:14] <masak> his attempt at doing so amazes me a bit -- that's not something I'd've tried

[08:15] <masak> I think something like $expr.Str ought to work -- assuming we want the standard stringification of ASTs to yield the program *code* itself, and not something more AST-y

[08:17] <nadim_> a few weeks ago this link was, I believe, in a P6 weekly, interesting read an nifty example of what lazy evaluation can be used for. But the main part was about attribute grammars. I find the idea interesting, grammar that can ct on objects rather than text. first things that comes to mind is XSD/DDT or even complex searches. Does P6 Grammar already support that or could easily be extended? is it altogether rubbish?

[08:27] <masak> nadim_: p6 grammars are (currently) fairly Str-centric

[08:27] <masak> nadim_: there's been discussion about allowing them on Cat, but Cat is still (IIRC) wildly unimplemented

[08:28] <masak> nadim_: I could see some uses on Buf, especially if it leads to a whole serialization/deserialization story

At this point, we'd need to recut point releases of three different projects, using the unbeaten path, which has a good chance of resulting in even more issues, so we (I?) knocked it on the head and finished for 2017.04.

[10:15] <xiaomiao> Zoffix: I see. Mostly reasonable (bugs happen, bugfixes happen). But having a rakudo release that can't be built against released nqp is not very nice

[10:16] <xiaomiao> (not complaining, just pointing out that you've accidentally made distro packagers a bit sad)

[10:16] <Zoffix> xiaomiao: I understand that.

[19:36] <moritz> took me only a few dozen attempts

[19:37] <tyil> thats not too bad

[19:43] <robertle> until (quite) a while ago, I could call a method in a different module, which would do "require ::Foo", and that made Foo available to the code calling into this module. this does not work anymore, which seems right as importing into the caller sounds wrong

[19:43] <robertle> but is there a differnt way to do this? I am trying to do something like "Pluggable"...

[19:44] <timotimo> right, you can't import "into the caller", you can only import into a "user", because then you can have a sub EXPORT

[19:44] <[Coke]> it's now lexically scoped.

[19:44] <[Coke]> (which might impact your use case)

[19:45] <robertle> ok, that makes sense. but is there a way to get the old behavior back? otehrwise I can't see how to dynamically load plugins...

[19:46] <timotimo> after you've required a module, you can stash it away in any datastructure you want

[19:46] <geekosaur> the code is present but not in scope. you could access it by global name instead of names imported into the lexical namespace?

[19:47] <robertle> I think what I am after is your "stash it" with an emphasis on the "it". currently i stash the require'd module name rather than the actual thing

[19:48] <timotimo> yeah, you ought to stash the module away, or chosen subs inside it or whatever

[19:50] *** rindolf joined
[19:51] <robertle> hmm, how do I get to the actual module from it's name?

[19:52] <timotimo> you "require ::($name)" it, no?

[19:52] <timotimo> m: my $name = "Test"; require ::($name); say ::($name).WHAT

[19:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar d057ef: OUTPUT: «(Test)␤»

[19:53] <timotimo> m: my $name = "Test"; require ::($name); say ::($name).WHO

[19:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar d057ef: OUTPUT: «Test␤»

[19:53] <robertle> right, that's what I do. and of course I could do a .new right after that, and store the result

[19:53] <timotimo> well, you don't want to .new a module

[19:53] <robertle> but that only works for modules that have a new, and has other problems

[19:53] <samcv> moritz, thanks for that. should work pretty well for my uses :)

[19:53] <robertle> I would rather store the module itself, and then pass that to someone else so that they can do .new on it without having to require it themselves

[19:54] *** Cabanossi left
[19:54] <robertle> like store the class rather than an instance of it

[19:54] *** zakharyas joined
[19:54] <timotimo> why would you ever .new on what require gives you?

[19:54] <timotimo> i mean, if it has a "unit class" in it, then sure

[19:54] *** ribasushi joined
[19:55] <samcv> m: say "blah".isa(Str:D)

[19:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar d057ef: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[19:55] <samcv> this does not work

[19:55] <robertle> exactly, it was just an example! so I want to dynamically load plugins. if the plugins are classes, then you could do .new on them. but they could just be modules, e.g. each with a sub do-sth() in them

[19:56] *** kurahaupo_ left
[19:56] <robertle> hmm, makes less and less sense the more I think about it

[19:57] *** Cabanossi joined
[19:57] <robertle> essentially I need a replacement for Module::Pluggable in perl5

[19:57] *** kurahaupo joined
[19:57] <robertle> until some time ago I could do this easily in perl6, but the (good) change to make require lexically scoped breaks that

[19:58] <robertle> so I am looking for some work around it...

[20:00] <robertle> if my plugins are always classes, then the plugin system can do require and then .new and store instances rather than the class. that's a bit oif a pity, but workable

[20:00] <robertle> but for non-oo, regular modules I seem to be bust...

[20:01] <geekosaur> there's a Package with that name though

[20:01] <robertle> Pluggable? yeah, that is broken too...

[20:06] <alphah>  hello Perl6, I'm getting this error when trying to merge two hashes, (it happens when left side hash is empty)

[20:06] <alphah> Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of  are not of the same length while recursing

[20:06] <alphah> left: 2 elements, right: 1 elements

[20:06] <[Coke]> m: my %stuff; { require Test ; %stuff<t> = Test } ; %stuff<t>.WHAT;

[20:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar d057ef: ( no output )

[20:06] <[Coke]> alphah: can you gist the code?

[20:06] <tyil> samcv: ^

[20:06] <alphah> I'm printing the hash before merging (That part in code is in TOP method for grammar action), here is in the output below:

[20:07] <tyil> does Hash::Merge suffer from this?

[20:07] <samcv> i don't think that's published to the eco yet tho?

[20:07] <tyil> but before it is :'D

[20:07] <samcv> yes alphah show us your code

[20:08] <samcv> me and tyil gonna publish a hash merging module shortly

[20:08] <alphah> Alright one moment, Will paste rest of info I have then show code

[20:08] <alphah> ./bin/program.p6  dummy

[20:08] <[Coke]> alphah: use a nopaste or gist service if it's more than a few lines. 

[20:08] <tyil> I'll wirte up a testcase either way

[20:08] <alphah> cnf hash: ${:origin("/tmp"), :yolo}

[20:08] <alphah> cmd hash: {}

[20:09] <tyil> also, `nc termbin.com 9999 < file.pm6`

[20:09] <alphah> cnf hash: ${:origin("/tmp"), :yolo}

[20:09] <alphah> cmd hash: Nil

[20:09] <alphah> Lists on either side of non-dwimmy hyperop of  are not of the same length while recursing

[20:09] <alphah> left: 2 elements, right: 1 elements

[20:09] <alphah> I dont get that error if I added cmd arg:

[20:09] <alphah> alphah@slackwork$ ./bin/program.p6 yolo  dummy

[20:09] <alphah> g cnf: ${:origin("nono"), :yolo}

[20:09] <alphah> g cmd: {:yolo}

[20:09] <[Coke]> alphah: please use a nopaste service.

[20:09] *** pat_js left
[20:10] <alphah> ok, one second

[20:10] <robertle> [Coke]: awesome!

[20:11] <tyil> samcv: seems like merging a hash into an empty hash is ok for us

[20:11] <samcv> yeah prolly

[20:11] <[Coke]> m: my %stuff; { require Test ; %stuff<t> = Test } ; %stuff<t>.WHAT.say # forgot the say

[20:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar d057ef: OUTPUT: «(Test)␤»

[20:11] <samcv> don't see why it wouldn't

[20:11] <[Coke]> Assuming you can't keep your require in the scope it's needed in, that trick might help.

[20:11] <samcv> alphah, does this description fit your needs? https://github.com/scriptkitties/p6-Hash-Merge

[20:11] <samcv> and if so what is not covered here or does not work for you

[20:12] <samcv> method name may change

[20:13] <alphah> samacv looks exactly what I need, but need to test it first

[20:13] <samcv> oh ok

[20:13] <samcv> cool.

[20:13] <samcv> also [Coke] what sholud i call the method so it won't conflict with any future merge method?

[20:14] <[Coke]> samcv:  unless you pick some-long-name-that-will-very-likely-never-conflict, you can't know.

[20:15] <samcv> mix lower and uppercase letters.... hehehe

[20:15] <[Coke]> I would use the simplest thing that works for now, and if a new version of p6 appears with a merge method, you can make yours be conditional on version.

[20:15] <samcv> %hash.MeRgE

[20:18] <alphah> Coke: here is the whole file, the problem happen in method TOP. (Please ignore the naming I'm using)

[20:22] <pmurias> ^^ can someone please check what the above does on Rakudo on windows?

[20:22] <samcv> that. hm

[20:23] <samcv> did not know we could turn strings into nums like that...

[20:24] <geekosaur> that's what Cool does

[20:25] <samcv> yes. didn't know it did that when asigning a string to a number like that. but i guess it makes sense sorta

[20:25] <samcv> didn't know about Inf though

[20:25] <samcv> or that you could have random text after a number and have it not freak out

[20:25] <samcv> i never tried

[20:26] <pmurias> geekosaur: it's a low level coercion that doesn't involve Cool

[20:27] <geekosaur> that does sound like trouble tbh

[20:27] <pmurias> it also seems to be operation system dependent, which sucks ultra hard

[20:34] <[Coke]> alphah: and how do you trigger the error you were mentioning?

[20:35] <[Coke]> do we have a "how to ask for help" link somewhere?

[20:36] <alphah> I have the main program includes, have this line my %hash = LawCmd.create(@*ARGS.Str);    and run the program as "alphah@slackwork$ ./bin/program.p6  dummy"

[20:36] <alphah> Coke:

[20:37] *** kurahaupo left
[20:37] <alphah> that will trigger the error, because %cmd arg hash will be empty, but running the program as  "alphah@slackwork$ ./bin/program.p6 yolo dummy", I dont get that error

[20:37] <[Coke]> so you're not showing us the code?

[20:37] <[Coke]> you're showing us some other code?

[20:37] <alphah> Coke: I pasted the whole file

[20:38] *** kurahaupo joined
[20:38] <alphah> this is the other file that has this line of code: 

[20:38] <[Coke]> (if I run your code with "dummy" as an arg, nothing happens)

[20:38] <[Coke]> you posted one file, then said you had another file.

[20:39] <[Coke]> part of helping us help you is to make it easy to see what's going on with the existing code you have, or for you to golf that code to highlight the problem (remove extraneous code until only the problem you're dealing with is present in the code)

[20:39] <alphah> sorry my mistake, thought I posteed the second,, really the second file doesn't have anything at all important, except creating the hash... posting it now

[20:40] <[Coke]> ok. I'm heading out shortly, hopefully someone can help you out. Good luck.

[20:41] <alphah> Alright, Thanks, here is the other file anyway https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8f7584cf60fbbead4f53d2d5dc39f8fd

[20:42] <alphah> I'm ccreating account on gist so I can have the code easily available next time

[20:43] <[Coke]> ok, that still doesn't compile, and also has a dependency on a file in /etc

[20:43] <[Coke]> I tried to switch the use's to load the first file, but then get stuck on other errors.

[20:44] *** alimon left
[20:45] *** alimon joined
[20:45] <[Coke]> I would recommend golfing down your error. make a small 10 line program which highlights the issue you're having; hardcode whatever data you need to show the issue.

[20:47] <[Coke]> (%physics<star> ««=«« $<star>.ast if $<star>; looks weird to me, fwiw)

[20:48] <alphah> alright will do that, I was trying to do that, by printing the two hashes that got produced from the program (as these the only things <<=<< op deals with during merging),  Iposted them earlier but will make a small program that shows the issue

[20:48] <alphah> Thank you for help

[20:48] <[Coke]> might help the next person if you posted that output in a separate gist.

[21:19] <Geth> Swapped META.info → META6.json in 8 dists in https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/commit/66b891e9fa

[21:19] <Zoffix> alphah: well, how can I repro the issue? So far I have a bunch of gists, but they don't fit together well.

[21:19] <Zoffix> alphah: stick --ll-exception flag to perl6; it'll tell you where the error is at

[21:21] <alphah> Zoffix: I just created the account at Github and pushed the code there: https://github.com/alphah77/galaxy

[21:22] <Zoffix> alphah: OK. And how do I make it error out?

[21:23] <alphah> and error shows when run "./bin/galaxy.p6  dummy"  , also the conf file should be in "/etc/galaxy/laws"    ,,, (laws file also is in "bin" directory in the project

[21:25] <alphah> works as expected without error in many other cases: for example "./bin/galaxy.p6 yolo dummy" . works fine.

[21:25] <Zoffix> alphah: what does this supposed to do again? I don't know hyperops: %physics<galaxy> ««=«« $<galaxy-laws>.ast;

[21:27] <alphah> that should merge the hash produced by .ast  $<galaxy-laws>.ast  to %physics<galaxy>  hash,,, overwriting duplicates keys, and save result in %physics<galaxy>

[21:27] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem: review: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/pull/331

[21:27] <alphah> and the error happens when $<galaxy-laws>.ast produces empty hash

[21:28] <Zoffix> alphah: so why not avoid that error same way as in:    %physics<star> ««=«« $<star>.ast if $<star> 

[21:30] <Zoffix> m: my %h = foo => { bar => { ber => 42 } }; my %h2 = foo => { meow => { moo => 72 } }; %h ««=«« %h2; dd %h

[21:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar ff4a03: OUTPUT: «Hash %h = {:foo(${:bar(${:ber(42)}), :meow(72)})}␤»

[21:30] * Zoffix wouldn't call that merging...

[21:30] <alphah> Zoffix: It's actually inside if statment, so I'm using the same conditional, the conditional is at line 145

[21:31] <Zoffix> m: my %h = foo => { bar => { ber => 42 } }; my %h2 = foo => { meow => { moo => 72 } }; %h «=« %h2; dd %h

[21:31] <Zoffix> How come two «« are used?

[21:32] <Zoffix> alphah: this is where the error points; I don't see an `if` statement up there: https://github.com/alphah77/galaxy/blob/master/lib/Physics.pm#L144

[21:32] <alphah> lol, that was typo, I was using <<=<<  ,, thats probably confused me.. I just fixed it and tested again but give same issue

[21:33] <Zoffix> Well, right that was just a side note. The original issue is there's no conditional for when $<galaxy-laws>.ast is empty
