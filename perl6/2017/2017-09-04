[02:15] <samcv> nice on this test of nqp::index, improves the speed for haystacks that are strands from 14.9s to 8.2495808s

[02:15] <samcv> should be commiting that very shortly

[02:16] <samcv> hopefully eventually we can get to the point where it takes more time to flatten the haystack than to keep it as strands for our regex

[02:16] <samcv> someday

[10:26] <sproctor> So I got back from holiday and decided to give Cro a poke. I'm getting an error about peer-host not existing on an IO::Async::Socket. Would this be related to running and requesting locally? 

[10:27] <jnthn> sproctor: No, just means that it depends on a feature in Rakudo 2017.08

[10:27] <sproctor> Ahhhhhh...

[10:28] <sproctor> See, the other thing I did this morning was move from rakudobrew to star.

[12:23] <Zoffix> There's an open issue somewhere.

[12:25] <raschipi> I'm aware.

[12:25] *** Aaronepower joined
[12:26] *** Aaronepower left
[12:26] <Skarsnik> the issue is not just .pod6 or not for pod file?

[12:27] *** pmurias left
[12:27] *** snarkyboojum joined
[12:28] <raschipi> Sorry Skarsnik, can you rephrase it?

[12:28] <Skarsnik> like should we name pod file as pod6 so github have a clue it's perl6 pod and not p5?

[12:29] <Zoffix> The issue is there's no (current) way to safely render pod6 as you can inject arbitrary code and IIRC GitHub never responded to whether they have a problem with that; and if they don't how we go about implementing that. IIRC they asked for a PR but no idea what the PR should do or where it should go.

[12:29] <Zoffix> Skarsnik: no, the issue is actually rendering .pod6 so they could display it on GitHub, instead of just raw file

[12:29] * lizmat starts on the P6W  (it's going to be a big one this week)

[12:30] <Zoffix> with .pod abiguity with Perl's pod... I'd say it's a non-issue TBH. Rakudo users should name their pod .pod6 and the issue disappears.

[12:30] *** pmurias joined
[12:32] <census> Zoffix maybe they changed the website? i tried to make a simpler version of the code and got this erro: Could not parse URI: https://patents.google.com/xhr/query?url=q%3DBabesiosis%26country%3DUS%26before%3D~ 2001 ~0101%26after%3D~ 2001 ~1231&exp=&download=true   in sub get at C:\rakudo\share\perl6\site\sources\A43871137AF18FF267579BE6084BD32415A09002 (WWW) line 9

[12:32] *** Aaronepower joined
[12:32] <census> Zoffix Indeed, I went to the website, and it does look a little different: https://patents.google.com/?q=Babesiosis&country=US&before=20011231&after=20010101

[12:32] <census> For example, there's no more /xhr/query?url

[12:33] <Zoffix> xhr => JS stuff

[12:33] <census> Zoffix okay are you saying I need that then?

[12:33] <Zoffix> You probably shouldn't have it in your code and instead use that different one.

[12:34] <census> Zoffix I don't follow what you mean. Are you saying to make the change I was thinking?

[12:34] <Zoffix> census: I mean the URL you're accessing in your code might be wrong. Try using this format: https://patents.google.com/?q=Babesiosis&country=US&before=20011231&after=20010101

[12:35] <Zoffix> census: also that "could not parse URI" error suggest the code in your pastebin differs from the code you're actually using. 

[12:35] <Zoffix> 'cause the latter looks like you stuck ~ chars in an attempt to concatenate, but you stuck them inside the string itself

[12:35] <census> Zoffix i wasn't clear. i just rewrote the code. so that's why it's 2 different errors

[12:35] <Zoffix> ok

[12:36] <Zoffix> Well, try the https://patents.google.com/?q=Babesiosis&country=US&before=20011231&after=20010101 lin

[12:36] <Zoffix> k

[12:37] <census> Zoffix that seems to work better: https://pastebin.com/yUReR4Yn  however i got an error now about the my $results-num variable. i understand the error, but i'm not sure why it's an i issue. is it the csv part is not good?

[12:38] <census> Variable '$results-num' is not declared at C:\Users\owner\Desktop/testgoogle.pl6:12 ------> my <HERE>$results-num = csv(:in<temp>).elems - 2;

[12:38] <Zoffix> census: you forgot the quote on the previous line, so it's trying to interpolate $results-num in the string

[12:47] *** Aaronepower left
[12:50] <Zoffix> .tell [Coke] FWIW, I'm not yet jump-in-ready. Was just curious. Though, I think I'll have time to give the SQL-based doc site a try in 4-5 weeks; it'll naturally have a new web app powering the site, so I'd be able to do BootStrap conversion then, if needed. The new system is a lot of work tho, so I'm hesitant to say "I'm gonna do it" :)

[12:50] <yoleaux> Zoffix: I'll pass your message to [Coke].

[12:50] *** Kyo91_ left
[12:51] <census> There's an issue with the .csv line I presume: https://pastebin.com/gFbJeBPF   to indicate it's 3 no matter what the search is

[12:52] *** pmurias left
[12:56] *** itaipu joined
[12:58] <Zoffix> Don

[12:58] <Zoffix> Don't presume. Print it and inspect it for yourself.

[12:58] <census> Zoffix I just checked the .csv and I still want to delete the first 2 rows. This one should give about 700, not 3

[13:00] <census> Zoffix I say I presume because I can't figure out where else the error is coming from. I did inspect it

[13:01] *** raschipi left
[13:02] <census> in perl5 there was a way to do something like a print screen (i forgot what it was called) to confirm that the html was indeed the correct screen

[13:05] *** pmurias joined
[13:06] <Zoffix> census: how did you inspect it?

[13:07] <census> Zoffix inspect what?  i went to the link that corresponds with what i'm typing into perl6. then i downloaded the .csv and examined how many elements there are in it

[13:08] *** xtreak_ left
[13:08] <census> by went, i mean I went to the link in my browser

[13:09] <Zoffix> census: so you only verified that the link you open in the browser works. It tells you nothing about the issue in your program.

[13:09] <census> Zoffix so that means either perl6 isn't going to the link the way i think it is or it's not grabbing the .csv the way i think it is.

[13:09] <Zoffix> census: print the data your script is downloading and inspect it before you parse it with CSV module.

[13:09] <census> Zoffix yes that's what i was saying before. there was a way to do so in perl5. what is the way to do so in perl6?

[13:10] <census> i used to test my code out like that all the time in perl5

[13:10] <Zoffix> census: simple `put` will suffice. There's also `dd` routine

[13:10] <census> are you sayign the `put' command will save it as an .html file

[13:11] <census> Zoffix I'm looking at: https://docs.perl6.org/routine/put

[13:21] <araraloren_fake> evening

[13:27] <sproctor> So I'm trying to see if I can use Cro::HTTP::Client standalone to get around the libSSL and threading issues. And I'm getting some errors. Does anyone know if there's anyway to get the details of the request made? the response object in the exception has a request in it but that seems to be empty. Thoughts? (And it's not done yet is a fine answer I know this is all bleeding edge).

[13:28] *** someuser joined
[13:29] <timotimo> cro has the tracing environment variable

[13:29] <timotimo> you could see if that does anything for the standalone client module, too

[13:38] <sena_kun> raschipi, never heard about this one, so at least me - no. :) And it's going to be cross-platform(at least for windows/macos), so I can feel if's.

[13:38] <sena_kun> *ifs

[13:39] *** itaipu joined
[13:39] <jnthn> Also, is that not something OpenSSL could use, and thus we'd get the benefit via that?

[13:42] <raschipi> link: https://lwn.net/Articles/666509/ It landed in 4.13

[13:43] <sena_kun> >Linux miskatonic 4.12.10_1 #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Aug 30 09:44:02 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux

[13:43] <sena_kun> I was close.

[13:43] <raschipi> OpenSSL needs to be involved in supporting it, but it can't be transparent.

[13:44] <sproctor> sena_kun, I'll try and get some more info first. 

[13:45] <sena_kun> sproctor, thanks~

[13:45] <census> Zoffix I'm not following the exact syntax

[13:46] <sena_kun> >he said the in-kernel TLS showed 2-7% better performance than the equivalent done in user space

[13:46] <census> i tried  dd "temp";

[13:47] <census> Zoffix i had also tried "temp".put;

[13:49] <raschipi> sena_kun: It's not certain that will help, they are going for the usecase where it can be offloaded to the NIC.

[13:51] <jnthn> I don't think this is going to help much without significant changes to the way IO::Socket::Async::SSL works fwiw

[13:51] *** ShalokShalom_ is now known as ShalokShalom

[13:51] <jnthn> Since the socket is a normal libuv socket

[13:52] <jnthn> And so we are getting buffers and then using the BIO interface to give them to the SSH lib to decrypt

[13:53] <jnthn> Maybe I'm missing some detail, though

[13:55] <geekosaur> this support would need to live in libssl

[13:55] <sproctor> sena_kun running with CRO_TRACE=1 it looks like the query string is being stripped off the URL. I'll try and golf it a bit and get something more useful.

[14:05] <yuyuyu> Zoffix, Timotimo What about introducing a type "Expo", which is a combination of two Rats, a base and an exponent. This way you solve those issues and you also get a precise representation of Complex numbers

[14:07] <sproctor> sena_kun: I've raised the issue. I *think* I might know that's causing it from a casual poke through the code.

[14:09] <Zoffix> yuyuyu: what? I think you're confusing me with someone

[14:10] *** yuyuyu left
[14:11] <Zoffix> ...

[14:11] <Zoffix> .oO( the hell was that about )

[14:11] <timotimo> it was about your log10 function

[14:12] <timotimo> if we carry on information about how such a number was made, i.e. by exponentiation, we could have exact results always

[14:12] <timotimo> except of course if we parse an int from a string, or calculate a gigantic sum, or stuff like that

[14:15] *** eliasr joined
[14:15] <Zoffix> Wouldn't a mathemical calculation be a lot more efficient than hauling every Int made outta a power op as an Expo type that has two Rats?

[14:16] *** Aaronepower joined
[14:16] <Zoffix> And what do you do with Ints made outta other operations? Fail to calculate the log? I think if I could type log 10**2000, I could type the result of it too. The goal is to get the answer for arbitrary numbers

[14:16] <timotimo> it seems a bit fragile

[14:39] <census> i tried to install the module but i still get the same error

[14:40] <Zoffix> Ah, it's faster 'cause &log10 delegates to methods and stuff

[15:49] <sjn> some of the terminology is a bit confusing

[15:52] <sjn> also, I'm having a little trouble getting the ":link" option to work

[15:53] <jnthn> No, name is human-friendly and can contain anything, id is what it's referred to in other instructions

[15:53] <jnthn> Though name is set to id by default

[15:55] <jnthn> We're still largely to do :link stuff (it's pretty high on the roadmap)

[15:55] <jnthn> The upside of writing docs before code is that everything is doc'd. The downside of writing docs before code is sometimes you didn't write the code yet. :)

[15:56] <rindolf> Can anyone help me? Is it a bug?

[15:56] <sjn> or just a "..." :)

[15:57] <jnthn> Yeah, sorry about that. Once we're a release or two down the line (and certainly once we hit 1.0) we'll make sure to have versioned docs.

[15:58] <sjn> here's another doc-confusion: under "HTTP Services" in the cro-tool document, it says ":link<service>", but the terms before this talk about "service-type" or "id"

[15:58] <jnthn> Yeah, :link<service-id> would be clearer.

[15:59] *** abraxxa left

[17:21] <census> Zoffix i thought the get from "temp".IO.spurt: get "https: ... " is stored in "temp" so i had tried "temp".put 

[17:21] <census> i'm not going to do data dump -- i do remember that from perl5, but i'm still having trouble with that package

[17:22] <census> that package in perl6. i'm just not figuring out how to set it up on this computer for perl6

[17:23] <geekosaur> census: "temp" is not a handle. "temp".IO is a file path, to which you can spurt (open, write an entire thing, close)

[17:24] <census> can i do something like dd "temp.IO ;

[17:24] <geekosaur> you can but it'll just show you an IO::Path object, not file contents

[17:25] <geekosaur> "temp" is a Str. "temp".IO is an IO::Path object --- a pathname.

[17:25] <census> may i ask how to see the file contents? saved as an .html file. i've done it before in perl5

[17:25] <geekosaur> "temp".IO.slurp

[17:27] *** Sound joined
[17:28] <census> i can't remember in perl5 geekosaur. is there a way to save data dump to an .html. i feel like i used to do a print command with it so i'd save as an .html and then i can open up the file

[17:29] <geekosaur> I don't recall an html dumper but there's this bit where web programmers always assume everyone is a web programmer and eat and shits html and json and no other formats ever exist

[17:30] <geekosaur> not to mention that "ibfrstructure" can only mena web infrastructure, "api" can only mean web api, etc.

[17:30] <census> geekosaur i don't follow you but i know in perl5 i was able to see the .html i was doing

[17:30] <geekosaur> basically my whole career has been erased because web programmers know there only is and only ever has been the web

[17:30] <geekosaur> I do not know what html magic you used in perl 5

[17:31] <census> i'll have to read my old codes again

[17:31] <census> anyhow, here's my current code geekosaur: https://pastebin.com/qp0fLmx3

[17:31] <geekosaur> I know you expect that all perl 5 programmers know that everything is, always has been, and always will be html, and therefore everyone knows only of those things

[17:31] <geekosaur> in perl 5 I used Data::Dumper. which does nto create html

[17:31] <geekosaur> I do not know what you used

[17:32] <geekosaur> yes, that's right, there are dumpers that do not produce html

[17:32] <geekosaur> and some programmers even use them

[17:32] <census> you're correct now that I think about it. but I did use Data::Dumper I believe with an html print sort of statement

[17:32] <census> geekosaur in my current code, the "say" statement prints the wrong number. i don't know it he problem is in how the $results variable is being created or with the get statement

[18:03] <yoleaux> 12:50Z <Zoffix> [Coke]: FWIW, I'm not yet jump-in-ready. Was just curious. Though, I think I'll have time to give the SQL-based doc site a try in 4-5 weeks; it'll naturally have a new web app powering the site, so I'd be able to do BootStrap conversion then, if needed. The new system is a lot of work tho, so I'm hesitant to say "I'm gonna do it" :)

[19:00] <geekosaur> I think it's a holdover

[19:01] <geekosaur> we used to expand @ (possibly pre-6.c) but it was decided that literal use is more common

[19:01] *** Skarsnik_ left
[19:02] <geekosaur> er, I meant pre-glr there

[19:03] <lizmat> [Coke]: the reason is probably that .perl output is intended to be EVALlable

[19:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b02b8: OUTPUT: «">>»[]\@foo"␤»

[19:04] <Zoffix> Probably because it's easier to escape the `@` instead of all the possible following chars that could make it interpolatable

[19:04] <lizmat> m: my @a = <a b c>; my $s = '@a[]'; dd $s.perl

[19:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4b02b8: OUTPUT: «"\"\\\@a[]\""␤»

[19:34] <tyil> .hug samcv 

[19:34] * huggable hugs samcv 

[19:34] <sena_kun> ipatrol, Japanese grammar is (mostly) easy, isn't it? Very ambiguous though. And hard to produce correctly. And sonkeigo is horrifying. And numerical system is a disaster. Well, ok, don't listen to me.

[19:34] <samcv> yay hugs

[19:35] <samcv> .hug tyil

[19:35] <ipatrol> sena_kun: the syntactical grammar is easy, what's hard are the semantics

[19:35] <sena_kun> ipatrol, true.

[19:36] <ipatrol> Right now I'm trying to write a toy program designed to automatically conjugate Japanese verbs given their hiragana form and the desired mood/tense

[19:36] <sena_kun> oh, sounds cool.

[19:36] <ipatrol> Which probably already exists, but I'm writing it mostly for study/reinforcement

[19:37] <sena_kun> but why do you need kana? you have already the ending of the verb.

[19:37] *** tesla_ joined
[19:37] <ipatrol> sena_kun: do I? I'm not far enough along in the course to know if that's so

[19:38] <ipatrol> I just figured that conjugations are a thing, looked them up, and indeed they are

[19:39] *** andrzejku left
[19:40] <sena_kun> I know about 2k kanji as for now and I've never seen an exception from what I'm going to say... For example, if you have "使う"(or (perhaps, almost) any other verb), you can derive conjugation just from "う" already. You don't need to feed "つかう"(i.e. hiragana of the verb) to your program.

[19:40] <sena_kun> Or I didn't understand properly how you're doing it.

[19:41] <ipatrol> sena_kun: I'm just using a simple tail regex to separate the verb endings. Doesn't matter either way, actually

[19:41] <sena_kun> true.

[19:42] <ipatrol> I started with this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc6f6a3e4968e1ce59f4a823549b360a but I'm actually rearranging it to take advantage of the vowel table

[20:51] <ugexe> wonder what the best way to display the entire dependency graph is

[20:52] <ugexe> i.e. is a simple \t per level going to take up too much space to be useful for any non-trivial dependency chain?

[20:53] <ugexe> i had this feature implemented before and it just labeled things 1.0.0.0, 1.0.0.1, 1.0.1.0, 1.0.1.1, 1.0.1.2 etc, so it was machine readable but to a human not as much
