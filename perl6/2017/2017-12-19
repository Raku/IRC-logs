[05:42] <Hotkeys> is there a handy way to use Z+ as part of an assignment operator

[05:42] <Hotkeys> like how you can `$foo += $bar`

[05:42] <Hotkeys> instead of `$foo = $foo Z+ $bar`

[05:43] <Hotkeys> oh

[14:57] <timotimo> that's fair. i've tried that in the past

[14:57] <Ulti> araraloren the modern version is called Unicon with OO stuff in, but it is incredible niche like tens of people in the world who publicly use it... there are certain private institutes I know (but shouldnt) that use it

[14:58] *** Morfent left
[14:58] <mspo> timotimo: it also seems like it would make it easier to link libedit (for repl) and libarchive (for reading .tar bundles of code) or whatever

[14:59] <araraloren> Ulti, Hmm, I see it in wiki

[14:59] *** konsolebox joined
[14:59] <araraloren> The Unicon

[14:59] <Ulti> yeah its well loved by the people who use it :D

[14:59] <timotimo> yeah, if those are statically (or even dynamically by ld.so) linked you don't have to bother with getting nativecall to find the files

[14:59] *** piojo_ left
[15:00] <mspo> timotimo: yeah I was trying to grok how the repl worked ages ago and got lost immediately :)

[15:02] <araraloren> Ulti, Thanks for your time :) go to bed now 88

[15:02] *** araraloren left
[15:05] <timotimo> well, the repl is perl6-level code

[15:06] <timotimo> if you mean how it makes the "execute after a line has been put in" magic work ... that's rather ugly and has many bad side-effects

[15:07] <Ulti> plus lots of editors now aren't C based and instead just want some API to twiddle with

[15:08] <mspo> Ulti: perl6 langserver is needed

[15:08] <Ulti> mspo: check out the Jupyter notebook stuff

[15:08] <Ulti> might be up your street

[15:08] <mspo> Ulti: that thing confused the hell out of me

[15:08] <Ulti> yeah

[15:08] <Ulti> its kind of a complex spec

[15:08] <mspo> Ulti: I ended up downloading some kind of program (I thought it was on the web?)

[15:08] <mspo> I mean just *using* jupyter at all :)

[15:08] *** comborico1611 joined
[15:09] <mspo> I'm too old for this shit

[15:09] <mspo> (apparently)

[15:10] <Ulti> yeah the web has sort of retired binary interfaces as a thing the majority care about

[16:07] <mahafyi> connected at long last with the asterisk manager. the change was not to use localhost but 127.0.0.1 as host 

[16:08] <mahafyi> and to run script as root, since asterisk daemon is running as root

[16:10] *** kaiwkx left
[16:10] *** astj left
[16:12] *** astj joined
[16:17] <timotimo> that sounds wrong

[16:17] <timotimo> you're connecting over a tcp socket; the daemon has no way of finding out what user you're connecting as

[16:18] *** geospeck left
[16:18] <timotimo> mahafyi: what kinds of errors were you getting?

[16:19] <mahafyi> timotimo : i will re echeck on that

[16:19] <mahafyi> i changed the ownership of script to root, prior to changing the host from localhost to 127.0.0.1

[16:19] <mahafyi> i will re run as a user

[16:20] <timotimo> who owns a script and who runs it are two different things, unless the setuid flag is set on the file; "setuid root" scripts are extremely risky things

[16:21] <huf> nah, they're fine since the suid bit doesnt matter on the script unless the interpreter is also suid and does bad things.

[16:21] <huf> at least that's how i remember it

[16:21] <timotimo> oh? that's very interesting

[16:21] <mahafyi> that is correct, the only change i needed was not use localhost, i am trying to find on why that is

[16:22] <mahafyi> there is no need to run as root / sudoer 

[16:22] *** troys is now known as troys_

[16:23] <timotimo> one difference can be ipv6 vs ipv4

[16:23] <timotimo> localhost is probably aliased to both 127.0.0.1 and ::1

[16:24] *** david_xd joined
[16:25] <mahafyi> right, and i will leave it aside actually for now. i have to understand what asterisk::perl is doing first. looks like i have to start out now bu understanding functions and how to use them in programs

[16:25] <timotimo> there's a method of connecting to services that are on machines that have both an ipv4 and ipv6 address but are only reacting on either of the two, which is to first try connecting via ipv6, and if that fails, somewhat-quickly fall back to ipv4

[16:25] *** Cabanossi left
[16:27] *** Cabanossi joined
[16:34] *** domidumont left
[16:36] <mahafyi> there are only three things , write ACTION string to the socket , which is simply Action: some-action-text , followed by crlf separated params specific to each Action, then await and do something on Response. And then there are events, which are written into that socket as specified by the asterisk admin in config files.

[16:36] *** troys_ is now known as troys

[16:38] <mahafyi> looks simple, but i guess its going to be a long uphill work for me. its all made in functional and OO programs, i checked python and php libs also for asterisk in github

[17:28] <mahafyi> in asterisk::perl,  there is one function which all other Actions use, like  %resp = $self->sendcommand( Action => 'Login', param1 => 'param1-value' etc). So I go back to the books now and learn to do the same, i suppose if one action worked, everything else will too. Then I can have a custom module to use for asterisk manager. Also, need to do with ssl support and md5 auth instead of...

[17:28] <mahafyi> ...plaintext, as it is what generally everyone uses.

[17:29] <timotimo> turning on ssl support is almost as easy as changing "IO::Socket::INET" to "IO::Socket::SSL"

[17:29] <timotimo> of course you really ought to check the correctness of the certificate, and that it's a certificate for the right thing

[17:29] <mahafyi> timotimo : oh ok, thanks

[17:30] <timotimo> under the hood, you'll be sending a stream of bytes and receiving a stream of bytes the same way in SSL or TCP

[17:37] <Zoffix> mahafyi: FWIW, this was all that was needed to enable SSL in IRC::Client module: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client/commit/bf3b492f3eda79a5b492a87750b26d4228777601#diff-1dbf71872cd219ba8fcdb00fa0edff9f

[17:38] <Zoffix> mahafyi: for MD5, you can use https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5 to do the hashing, so "md5 auth" sounds like something from last century and with today's hardware is easily cracked

[17:40] <mahafyi> Zoffix, thank you verymuch. I missed your last message yesterday, though i got it first thing from irc log today and thats what connected to the asterisk manager. i will work on it. As for the md5, sure, i guess the security controls comes from firewalling the port and later on maybe more. right now, i will use it only only localhost and disallow everything else.

[17:40] *** ruschlem_ left
[17:42] <Zoffix> .tell araraloren FWIW, here's how IRC::Client reads from an async sock. It just parses what it gets as much as it can and saves left over stuff for the next time some data arrives: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IRC-Client/blob/master/lib/IRC/Client.pm6#L203-L214

[21:47] <moritz> huh?

[21:48] <lizmat> looks like Camelia lost its $*IN

[21:48] <moritz> where's camelia?

[21:48] <moritz> that's not camelia :/

[21:48] <lizmat> ah 

[21:48] <lizmat> duh :-)

[21:48] <geekosaur> camelia's host is apparently wedged

[21:48] <Ven``> cpan install of Text::Multimarkdown failed :\ mmh..

[21:48] <geekosaur> [19 19:31:14] <Zoffix> looks like box is ded. can't ssh to niner.name

[21:49] <moritz> nine: "ssh niner.name" hangs, and camelia is dead. Please fix at your convenience

[21:50] <Slayerk> moritz: "camelia is dead" RIP

[21:50] <geekosaur> (or it just needs some hot tea to wake it up...)

[21:50] <Slayerk> ;_;

[21:50] <Ven``> seems like I need to code-indent by hand after markdown-izing

[21:51] *** Ven`` left
[21:52] *** Ven`` joined
[21:53] <moritz> ssh niner.name eventually worked

[21:53] <moritz> and the host doesn't feel slow

[21:54] <Slayerk> Hmm, trying .words or IN.get still gives only 1 element in the array

[21:54] <moritz> typically, that's some kind of DNS problem or so, but DNS seems to work fine on the box 

[21:54] <Slayerk> I guess I could add the commas "gasp" ... manually

[21:54] <moritz> or split on the spaces

[21:54] <moritz> though if they are really spaces, why doesn't .words work?

[21:55] <MasterDuke> m: say "a b c".words.join(',')

[21:55] <evalable6> MasterDuke, rakudo-moar 334b87226: OUTPUT: «a,b,c␤»

[21:56] <Slayerk> Master Duke: I think that's a good idea. I could slurp it first, and spaces and then add the elements to the array

[21:56] <Slayerk> I meant add commas

[21:56] <Slayerk> :P

[22:04] <Ven``> Ok, post scheduled

[22:04] <Ven``> after some fixings

[22:04] <lizmat> Ven``++

[22:05] <lizmat> Ven`` : perhaps prefix "Day 20: " to title ?

[22:05] <moritz> Ven``: very nice. Might be a good idea to add a link to the 007 git repo somewhere

[22:07] <lizmat> Ven``: is the FizzBuzz code example supposed to be runnable Perl 6 code ?

[22:07] <Ven``> lizmat: nope! it's runnable 007 code :-).

[22:07] <lizmat> oki

[22:08] <Ven``> did prefix, lizmat++. also added the missing link, moritz++

[22:08] <Ven``> lizmat: did you receive my PMs, or did I fail sending them?

[22:10] <lizmat> Ven``: perhaps also link "Perl 6 docs on ff apply here" to https://docs.perl6.org/routine/ff ?

[22:11] <Ven``> done!

[22:11] <lizmat> Ven``: I would remove the line: "Before I leave you with your appriopriate amount of meta-fun," and replace it with something lika "have a lot of meta-fun" after the code example

[22:11] *** Morfent joined
[22:11] <lizmat> in the current way, the blog post sorta feels unfinished

[22:12] <lizmat> at least visually ( rather than textually)

[22:13] <Ven``> lizmat: I can add "here's the code in 007 <xx> and here are the 007 docs <yy>"?

[22:14] <lizmat> sure... it was just a suggestion as to what *I* would do  :-)

[22:16] <Ven``> well, I'm looking for ways to fix it :)

[22:21] <lizmat> Ven``++

[22:21] * lizmat goes afk again

[22:27] <Slayerk> Is it possible to use .grep to replace spaces with commas in a string?

[22:30] <MasterDuke> Slayerk: you don't want to use .subst ?

[22:31] <MasterDuke> or .tr ?
