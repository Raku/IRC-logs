[00:12] * zengargoyle FML - "thanks @zengargoyle ! been looking for a replacement for something like FocusMe on win/mac, this is the closest iv'e found so far so will continue giving it a shot"

[00:18] * zengargoyle expects i will have to write a non-gui version.  this person listened to my non-documented hack-arounds, isn't afraid of the Terminal and sudo and editing YAML files and still wants that thing i made on a whim in response to some random post on a Q&A site.

[00:20] * zengargoyle that i never actually used myself because knowing how it works negates the reason for it's existance. aaarrrrggghhh.

[01:32] <geekosaur> I don't think that does what you want

[01:33] <geekosaur> "handles" trait defines AT-KEY in Foo to do AT-KEY in %.hash

[01:33] <geekosaur> oh, I see, you want overrideable. I think you have to do that by hand

[01:34] <geekosaur> just as you would have to define your own accessors instead of somehow modifying the autogenerated ones with has $.whatever

[10:40] <baar> hello all. One question about sigils:

[10:41] <baar> in Python I can create class with methofs typical for some containers. But without to extend base container type

[10:41] <baar> for example iterable but without setting. Or with indexable getter but without setting and other combinations

[10:42] *** dubi0us joined
[10:43] <baar> This mean that I can not say what is it: list, hash or something else. So if I can do the same in Perl, what sigil I should use for such instances? How to select sigil?

[10:43] <baar> I mean Perl6 sure

[10:44] *** mr-foobar joined
[10:46] *** notbenh joined
[10:46] <jnthn> You can put anything in a $ so that's always an option.

[10:46] *** dubi0us left
[10:46] *** mr-fooba_ left
[10:47] <jnthn> @ means "I can index into it like @a[...]"; you don't have to subclass anything, just do the Positional role. The role for % is associative and means "I can index into it like %h{...}"

[10:47] <jnthn> *Associative

[10:48] <jnthn> m: my %h is BagHash # an example of an Associative built-in that's not Hash

[10:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 047464: ( no output )

[10:49] <jnthn> https://docs.perl6.org/language/subscripts#Custom_types may be useful also

[10:50] <timotimo> hmm, if BagHash isn't Hash, maybe it should be called something different. maybe HashyBag :D

[13:49] <lucasb> yo

[13:49] <sacomo> konbanwa

[13:50] <sacomo> are either of you familiar with match?

[13:51] <sacomo> when I return a list of matches the results are wrapped in ｢｣ brackets

[13:52] *** dubi0us left
[13:52] <lucasb> you want just the string matched, not the match object?

[13:52] <sacomo> is the best way to get thos to Str to just use .Str?

[13:52] <sacomo> yeah, is there a better way? like some option I can pass to match?

[13:53] <lucasb> yes, I would guess calling .Str on it is the way to go

[13:53] <jnthn> Can also stringify them with the ~ prefix operator, or if you just use them in a context that wants a Str then you'll get that

[13:54] <jnthn> fwiw, in Perl 6 a Match is an object (and nested matches form a tree)

[13:54] <sacomo> ok, thanks.

[13:55] <jnthn> And it's the .gist method that does the formatted output (which is used by `say`)

[13:55] <jnthn> If using, for example, `put` instead of `say`, which just outputs the string value, then you'd also get them without that

[13:56] <sacomo> the ~ prefix is simple

[13:56] <sacomo> ok, that is good to know

[16:12] <timotimo> the built-in clone doesn't do what you need it to? you need deep cloning semantics?

[16:12] *** dubi0us left
[16:13] <FROGGS> araraloren: usually you care about dependencies first (in a recursive manner)... but I dunno what your use-case is, and whet difference there is

[16:13] <araraloren> timotimo, yeah right, I want a deep clone

[16:14] <timotimo> with a clone you won't likely have any inter-attribute dependencies?

[16:14] <timotimo> you just set all the attributes?

[16:15] <araraloren> I want figure out what is the right way to do it .

[16:16] <araraloren> m: class B { has $.s; method clone(*%_) { self.bless(s => %_<s> // $!s.clone); } }; class A is B { has @.a; method clone(*%_) { self.bless(a => %_<a> // @!a.clone()); }; }; my $a = A.new(a => [1, 2, 3], s => 8); my $b = $a.clone(); $a.a.push(23);say $b;

[20:58] <Juerd> Interesting that adverbs are looser than ||

[20:58] <Juerd> Does that have use cases?

[20:59] <leont> Solved it be switching them around

[20:59] <masak> Juerd: adverbs don't really participate in the precedence game. they just seek out the highest node in the AST fragment they're in.

[21:01] <Juerd> masak: What's a good strategy for me, as a code reading human, to know what the adverb will be applied to?

[21:01] <leont> ugexe: And now zef doesn't want to do anything. «Too few positionals passed; expected 2 arguments but got 1», Zef::Repository::LocalCache line 90

[21:04] <masak> Juerd: it will apply to the loosest operator that precedes it (but no looser than infix:<,>)

[21:05] *** parv joined
[21:05] <masak> Juerd: so if you have a sense of the order the operators will execute in, you can form an intuition of what the adverb will bind to

[21:05] <Juerd> masak: Oh, so in %foo{$key}:exists it applies to the operator {}, rather than the hash?

[21:05] <masak> aye

[21:05] <Juerd> I should read up on adverbs. I understand very little about them.

[21:05] <masak> %foo is a term, not an operator :)

[21:05] <Juerd> Good point, but I find this syntax rather alien :)

[21:06] <masak> but with `+%foo{$key} :exists`, it applies to the prefix:<+>; probably not intended

[21:06] <Juerd> Ahh

[21:06] <masak> because prefix:<+> is very loose

[21:06] <Juerd> Thanks, this clears up a lot of the fog in my mind, regarding adverbs

[21:06] <masak> the one that always bites me is the `||` above. or `&&`

[21:06] <masak> basically, I find (for me) adverbs break a fundamental expectation of refactoring

[21:07] <masak> that subexpressions can be re-arranged according to mathematical laws

[21:07] <leont> I would have expected them to bind on proximity

[21:07] <masak> yes, that might have been nice

[21:09] <timotimo> maybe it's time for a slang to explore this

[21:09] <masak> \o/

[21:09] <masak> to the slang machine!

[21:09] <timotimo> that was not me volunteering

[21:09] <timotimo> :)

[21:10] <masak> history will be the judge of that

[21:11] <timotimo> historians from the future will not be able to retroactively force me to implement this :)

[21:12] <timotimo> well, if sufficiently far in the future, it might be possible

[21:13] <masak> any sufficiently advanced future-historianism is indistinguishable from coercion

[21:14] <iH2O> why doesn't "say;" work to print an empty line? what is the cleanest way to do it?

[21:14] *** araraloren left
[21:14] <masak> m: say ""

[21:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar c56f0a: OUTPUT: «␤»

[21:14] <masak> iH2O: historical reasons.

[21:14] <evalable6> iH2O, rakudo-moar c56f0af9a: OUTPUT: «»

[21:15] <masak> iH2O: in Perl 5, `say` means `say $_`

[21:15] <iH2O> ok

[21:16] <masak> iH2O: and it was decided early on that people who wrote `say;` in Perl 6 would be far too likely to mean `say $_;` (influenced by Perl 5) even though by the logic of Perl 6 it clearly means `say "";`

[21:18] <yoleaux> 30 Jun 2017 10:19Z <HelpBot[perl6]> parv: you should only ever use releases and not "build every day" off a random commit. Non-release commits aren't as thoroughly tested and it isn't uncommon for them to have some regressions. People who build them are like people who do 30 over speed limit: they think they know better and would like to get (bugfixes) fast, but eventually they'll come across a untested pothole that wipes all their data.

[21:18] <masak> I've always felt that those of us who don't have a strong Perl 5 lilt have been short-changed by that "potential difficulty" error. `say;` is such a nice, short, clear, straightforward thing to write.

[21:18] <masak> but, on the other hand, I haven't been strongly pushing for a pragma-or-something to turn it off, either, so... :)

[21:20] <parv> masak, i won't have minded if Perl 6 would not even bear a passing similarity to Perl 5 (which I have been using for a long time)

[21:34] <Shanta> This is Rakudo version 2016.12 built on MoarVM version 2016.12 implementing Perl 6.c.

[21:35] <timotimo> that's rather old

[21:36] *** lucasb left
[21:38] <Shanta> zengargoyle tried yor sugestion shorter error list but same problem

[21:44] <timotimo> Shanta: it's definitely possible that your version of rakudo is too old to install zef

[21:47] <Shanta> Just downloaded from the site.

[21:51] <timotimo> you're on a 32bit windows?

[21:51] <timotimo> no, that's 2016.01

[21:51] <Shanta> linux

[21:51] <timotimo> where did you download it? rakudo.org has 2017.04, or 2016.01, not 2016.12

[21:51] <Shanta> yes

[21:52] <Shanta> I will try again from the tar.

[21:53] <Shanta> did the first install from the web page code as shown way above.

[21:54] *** wamba left
[21:57] <El_Che> Shanta: in case you just want rakudo and want to install modules with zef: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases

[21:57] <Shanta> wget  https://rakudo.perl6.org/downloads/rakudo/rakudo-2017.06.tar.gz 3 tar xzf rakudo-2017.06.tar.gz 4 cd rakudo-2017.06/ 5 perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar 6 make 7 make install

[21:58] <timotimo> it will not install that rakudo systemwide btw

[21:58] <Shanta>  El_Che can't get zef installed yet.

[21:59] <timotimo> maybe you have a PATH that points to an older perl6 binary?

[21:59] <timotimo> what would "which perl6" say?

[22:00] <El_Che> Shanta: the link I gave you are precompiled linux packages that include a script to install zef.

[22:00] <Shanta> I am reading the i should have .06

[22:00] <El_Che> rakudo star on linux are: source to compiles with a set of pre-chose modules

[22:01] <Shanta> code used to get zef git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git Cloning into 'zef'...

[22:02] <timotimo> + documentation

[22:02] <Shanta>  path seems to be /usr/bin/perl6

[22:02] *** parv left
[22:03] <timotimo> okay, it wouldn't install that with the commandline you gave above

[22:03] <timotimo> so that must be the przoblem

[22:03] <timotimo> did you try installing a perl6 with your package manager?

[22:03] *** |oLa| left
[22:03] <Shanta> yes them removed it as it would be too old.

[22:04] <timotimo> hm, but somehow it must have stuck around

[22:07] <Shanta> Maybe I pull a windows to get the path to refresh Primarily flowing Gabor Szabo's new book.

[22:07] <timotimo> oh cool

[22:07] <timotimo> if there's no perl6 binary at that path, which wouldn't output it and calling perl6 wouldn't try to run it
