[02:05] <AlexDaniel> I thought whateverable used abspath, but no, it is using .absolute method

[02:06] <AlexDaniel> feels like I won't need to change any code because of IO grant work

[07:10] <lizmat> sjn++  # good catch, fixed

[07:12] <moritz> what's an appimage? something for macos?

[07:15] <samcv> no, linux

[07:15] <samcv> you download the binary, and run it. standalone

[07:15] <moritz> so statically compiled? or some kind of package manager?

[07:15] <samcv> uh.

[07:15] <samcv> not a package manager

[07:15] <moritz> or like an .exe installer for windows?

[07:16] <samcv> no

[07:16] * moritz a thick today

[07:16] <samcv> you +x it

[07:16] <samcv> then run it

[07:16] <samcv> and it starts perl6 prompt

[07:16] <samcv> that's it.

[07:16] *** curan joined
[07:16] <samcv> no install

[07:17] <samcv> and you can put it in whatever path you want

[07:17] <moritz> wow, that's *way* cool

[07:17] <samcv> yeah

[07:17] <u-ou> is it like docker

[07:17] <moritz> relocatable!

[07:17] <samcv> dl https://github.com/samcv/rakudo-appimage/tree/gh-pages one of these

[07:17] <samcv> the stable is uh. things work fine

[07:17] <samcv> the testing you can give it relative paths and it will find things

[07:18] <samcv> and that works mostly fine but there's some hackage of the command line args in the perl6 shell script

[07:18] <samcv> not really u-ou 

[07:18] <samcv> it's like those linux iso's

[07:18] <samcv> same format. like an executable tmp disk image

[07:18] <samcv> thing...

[07:18] <u-ou> ahh

[07:19] <samcv> idk it's great. lots of hacks to get it to work though, including patching all the binaries

[07:19] <samcv> to have relative paths ;)

[07:19] <samcv> it builds in /rsu folder. and then my build script i made patches the binaries into ././

[07:19] <samcv> and many other assorted things

[07:20] <samcv> and i just an hour or so ago, got travis commiting to the repo with appimages that travis builds itself

[07:21] <samcv> which is amazing

[07:21] <samcv> i could put it on a cron and have it do nightly builds of rakudo blead

[07:22] *** parv joined

[08:41] <samcv> if we had a command line argument or something to do that, would solve the last main issue with the appimages, with them starting out with $*CWD in the ramdisk/whaever it is

[10:50] <melezhik> Hi Perl6 gurus!

[10:50] <melezhik> I am struggling with main sub , passing options as array

[10:50] <melezhik> perl6 -e 'sub MAIN ( Array :@a ){ }' -a=1

[10:51] <melezhik> get this:  usage: -e '...' [-a=<Positional[Array]>]

[10:51] <melezhik> and none zero exit code

[10:52] <masak> yes, because that `1` you're passing is not an array

[10:52] <melezhik> so, how can I pass is as array?

[10:52] <masak> I've never thought about it. not sure you can

[10:53] <ilmari> perl6 -e 'sub MAIN (Int :@a){ say @a }' -a=1 # no worky either

[10:53] <ilmari> Usage: -e '...' [-a=<Positional[Int]>] 

[10:54] <ilmari> Array :@a asks for an array of arrays

[10:54] <masak> oh, right. forgot to mention that.

[10:54] <jnthn> I think the only place an array makes sense in MAIN is a slurpy one

[10:54] <masak> that's an eternal gotcha for newcomers; the `@` already encodes Array/Positional

[10:55] <melezhik> well, let me reshape , how can I pass a  list of values to MAIN sub? is it possible?

[10:56] <jnthn> melezhik: I'm not aware of a way besides the slurpy

[10:56] <melezhik> ok

[10:56] <jnthn> sub MAIN(*@foo) { } # if you run it as script foo bar baz, then @foo has 3 elements

[10:57] * jnthn has used that somewhere

[10:57] <lizmat> melezhik: perhaps -a=1,2,3  and then split on ',' ?

[10:57] <melezhik> good, but I need to pass a named parameters 

[10:57] <jnthn> OK, then juist take a string and split it yourself

[10:57] <jnthn> As lizmat suggested

[10:57] <melezhik> yeah, I already have a "split" version

[10:57] <melezhik> just looked more elegant way

[10:57] <melezhik> but that's ok

[10:57] <lizmat> melezhik: or perhaps .words 

[10:58] <melezhik> will go with "split", not a big deal ... 

[10:58] <jnthn> I don't think there is one... Also if there was then it might also mean that you could pass -a=1 -a=2 and so on and it should collect all of the a options into the array

[10:58] <jnthn> So it's not clear an auto-split semantic is what's wanted either

[10:59] <melezhik> yeah, not still clear  why "-a=1 -a=2 -a=3" is bad idea?

[11:00] <jnthn> melezhik: I didn't say it was a bad idea, just that it might be a more natural mapping for arrays in MAIN signatures

[11:00] <jnthn> (Than splitting a single thing)

[11:01] <jnthn> It can't mean both things, so we'd have to pick 

[11:01] *** kurahaupo joined
[11:01] <melezhik> jnthn : Ok, I see

[11:02] *** xtreak joined
[11:02] <melezhik> as for me "-a=1 -a=2 -a-3" would be good ))

[11:05] <masak> $ perl6 -e 'sub MAIN(:@a) { say @a }' -a=1 -a=2

[11:05] <masak> [1 2]

[11:05] <masak> seems to work

[11:05] <jnthn> Oh...

[11:05] * jnthn had no idea :)

[11:06] <ilmari> oh, I had an ancient rakudo, so my test was probably invalid

[11:06] * ilmari brews a new one

[11:06] <jnthn> I note usage is like

[11:06] <jnthn> [-a=<Positional>]

[11:06] <jnthn> Which is a bit LTA

[11:06] <masak> aye

[11:06] <masak> m: sub foo(:$a) { say $a }; foo(a => 1, a => 2)

[11:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[11:06] <jnthn> That's what I was going on when I figured it didn't know how to handle it.

[11:07] <masak> some time in the distant past, this used to be spec'd to also make an array

[11:07] <masak> but I think moritz and I killed off that bit, mebbe

[11:07] <masak> semi-funnily, the "make an array" semantics makes some sense now that I consider it in light of MAIN, which I'm sure I didn't way back when

[11:11] <ilmari> masak: ah, it works without the type constraint on the array parameter

[11:11] <ilmari> but only if you pass more than one -a

[11:11] <masak> yes, type constraints on arrays are more or less useless in Perl 6

[11:11] *** Cabanossi joined
[11:11] <masak> yes, you need to pass more than one -a for it to *become* an array

[11:12] <masak> heh. my several-years-down-the-line impression of Perl 6's efforts at being DWIMmy with types is... "don't" :P

[11:13] <masak> I'd rather be explicit about what's an array/list/sequence than suffer the WATs of Perl 6 trying to figure it out

[14:46] <raschipi> URI is a bigger generalization than that. file:/// for example, is a URL too.

[14:46] *** jonas1 left
[14:47] <raschipi> URI is the union between URLs and URNs.

[14:47] <raschipi> URNs of course, were abandoned.

[14:47] <ilmari> ISBNs are examples of URNs

[14:49] <raschipi> Yeah, they are. But I haven't seen them used in the internet. There's DOI, but there's not much use too.

[14:54] <moritz> I used DOIs when I was still in academia, but probably not in any way you could have counted

[14:54] <moritz> raschipi: those are probably just the institutions that generate new DOIs; many more users actually use them

[14:54] <raschipi> It's the number of entities that can register them. Of course they're all big and register a lot of them for their affiliates.

[14:54] <raschipi> moritz: Yes, I agree.

[14:55] <moritz> much like there is a small number of institutions that allocate ISBNs, but everybody who buys or cites a book uses them

[14:55] *** stmuk left
[14:57] <raschipi> Well, it is growing. They recently creted a registration authority system, similar to what ICANN does for domain names.

[14:57] <timotimo> or like domain names

[17:00] <TreyHarris> Isn't there a 'use Very::Long::Name :as<Short>;' feature? I thought there was, but I can't find it

[17:02] <geekosaur> no, in perl a module is always in its specified namespace. in perl 5 there's a glob-alias hack; dunno offhand how you'd translate it to perl 6

[17:02] *** Geth left
[17:02] <TreyHarris> And related question: how can I create a class named the same as one that's already been used and still refer to the old class? In this case, I want to use a native Perl 6 class that's named the same as a class that I got using Inline::Perl5

[17:02] <geekosaur> (you may be thinking of haskell's import ... as ?)

[17:03] *** Geth joined
[17:03] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v Geth

[17:03] <TreyHarris> geekosaur: I definitely am, but I thought Perl 6 had similar.

[17:03] <geekosaur> problem being that perl has an actual gobal namespace

[17:03] <geekosaur> *global

[17:03] <geekosaur> so the module space you see is the module space everything sees

[17:04] *** Geth left
[17:04] <TreyHarris> Right. Can I do some lexical tricks to solve either problem? Make A::Very::Very::Long::And::Unwieldy::Module something I can refer to with a shorter variable, or to refer to the :from<Perl5> variant separately from the Perl 6 variant?

[17:09] <TreyHarris> (To put into context: as part of my project, I will need to port a Perl 5 module, because using it directly via Inline::Perl5 is unwieldy and misses some very obvious features because it isn't Perl 6. Porting the module is going to be slightly painful, and for my POC I wanted to just write a bridge. I can do that--*have* done that--by slapping ::P6:: into the namespace of the Perl 6 bridge. But I _keep_ making

[17:09] <TreyHarris> the mistake of referring to the Perl 5 name instead of the ...::P6::... name, and because it works 90% of the time, it ends up being a really annoying bug to squash. So just naming my bridge exactly the same as the Perl5 module would fix it, but it appears that is just not possible?)

[17:12] *** rindolf joined
[17:13] <geekosaur> no, you'd have to inject the p6 stuff into the p5 module's namespace... which might be difficult given it lives in perl 5

[17:15] *** bjz left
[17:16] <TreyHarris> Sigh. Maybe my best bet then is to rename my bridge into something very different from the P5 version and very short (instead of Proc::ProcessTable:from<Perl5> and Proc::ProcessTable::P6, maybe XBridge::ProcTable), then I can do a grep-replace once I've ported Proc::ProcessTable.

[17:18] *** domidumont joined
[17:24] <TreyHarris> Different subject: I'm finding in writing Inline::Perl5 bridges in general (which I do frequently for one-offs and POCs), there's a frequent need for something like this for "static methods": multi method foo (Klass:U $:) { self.new.foo } multi method foo (Klass:D $:) { ... }

[17:24] <TreyHarris> Is there a shorter/idiomatic way for that?

[17:30] *** ChoHag joined

[17:33] <TreyHarris> b2gills: yes! Looking at my WIPs, I tried that, but when I had a different bug going on at the same time masking the issue. though I did binding to the const.... is there any reason to prefer "constant XYZ = X::Y::Z" over "constant XYZ := X::Y::Z"?

[18:41] <unclechu> like `chr(8)` to get char to move cursor one column left

[18:42] <moritz> what do you mean by "native"?

[19:26] <alphah> christmas!

[19:27] <gfldex> from the standpoint of the compiler, it doens't have special meaning beyond 'b'.succ

[19:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «No such method 'succ' for invocant of type 'Version'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[19:30] <TreyHarris> Is there an idiom or something that will help with creating "static methods" that can be called on instances, or, when called on classes, call the method on a throwaway object? See https://gist.github.com/treyharris/919902805f27f447893e43b504d246bd

[19:36] <gfldex> TreyHarris: you could use $?CLASS

[19:36] <El_Che> don't you just want a sub for that?

[19:39] <gfldex> m: class C { our sub s(){ dd $?CLASS::new } }; C::s

[19:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «Any $v = Any␤»

[19:39] <gfldex> m: class C { our sub s(){ dd $?CLASS.new } }; C::s

[19:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «C.new␤»

[19:40] <TreyHarris> gfldex: As in 'multi method hrm($?CLASS:U $: Int $n)' ?

[19:40] <jnthn> Would need to be ::?CLASS:U

[19:40] <jnthn> And the $ ain't needed

[19:40] <gfldex> yes, that can help if you copypasta from methods between classes

[19:40] <TreyHarris> That gives me en error: In signature parameter $?CLASS, it is illegal to use the ? twigil

[19:40] <jnthn> Though this is optional; any method that doesn't access attributes can be called on the type object

[19:41] <jnthn> So unless for some reason you want to *force* the user to only ever call it on the type object, and never on an instance, there's no particular need to mark it

[19:41] <TreyHarris> yes, ::?CLASS:U works.

[19:41] <jnthn> m: class C { method m() { say "look I'm static!" } }; C.m; 

[19:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «look I'm static!␤»

[19:42] <TreyHarris> jnthn: but then I can't call it as a class method

[19:42] <gfldex> m: class C { method m() { say "look I'm static!"; dd self } }; C.m;

[19:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «look I'm static!␤C␤»

[19:42] <gfldex> please note that self in this case points to the type object, not an instance of C

[19:42] <TreyHarris> jnthn: Your example isn't relevant because it doesn't use an instance attribute. The compiler catches that and complains.

[19:42] <TreyHarris> My gist does that

[19:43] <TreyHarris> Are you saying in my gist I can remove the multi from the ":D" version and remove the ":U" version completely and get the same behavior? Because I'm not...

[19:43] <jnthn> Ah, no

[19:43] <jnthn> You want more than just a static method, I see

[19:44] <jnthn> So yeah, multi over :D and :U is the way to go

[19:44] <TreyHarris> So ::?CLASS is my first fix. Can I avoid repeating "hrm"?

[19:44] <gfldex> m: class C { method m() { self := self // C.new } }; C.m;

[19:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Cannot use bind operator with this left-hand side␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3 C { method m() { self := self // C.new 7⏏5} }; C.m;␤»

[19:44] *** Guest64639 left
[19:44] <jnthn> An alternative idiom for this might be

[19:45] <TreyHarris> (Reload the gist for the ::?CLASS version.)

[19:45] <jnthn> m: class C { has $.x = 0; method m($self is copy:) { .= new without $self; say $self.x } }; C.m

[19:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Preceding context expects a term, but found infix .= instead␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3s $.x = 0; method m($self is copy:) { .=7⏏5 new without $self; say $self.x } }; C.m␤»

[19:45] <gfldex> callwith should work if you provide the invocant by hand

[19:46] <jnthn> m: class C { has $.x = 0; method m($self is copy:) { .=new without $self; say $self.x } }; C.m

[19:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar b6838e: OUTPUT: «0␤»

[19:46] <jnthn> Though that'll only work if youuse the . forms, not the ! forms, of attributes

[19:46] <TreyHarris> what's the correct callwith syntax then?

[19:47] <jnthn> An alternative is to just to meta-programming and write a MOP module that wraps everything :)

[19:47] <jnthn> *just go

[19:49] <gfldex> TreyHarris: i wrote 'should' not 'will' to indicate a guess on my side

[19:51] <TreyHarris> jnthn, this is not the correct syntax, can you tell me what is? callwith(self.new(): $n);

[19:51] <jnthn> callwith iterates an existing candidate list, rather than re-dispatching

[19:51] <jnthn> So that isn't useful in this case

[19:51] *** TEttinger joined
[19:53] <jnthn> I *think* samewith - which does redispatch - also latches onto the original invocant

[19:54] *** ChoHag joined
[19:54] *** AlexDaniel left
[19:55] <TreyHarris> jnthn: I'd dealing with a whole mess of Perl5 modules that all have this issue where all methods must be called on a blessed reference even though that's only in order to get defaults. (Specifically, they all have "->fields" methods which tell you what fields are available for the given class, which is surely not something you need an instance for, but the way it was done in Perl 5 requires it.) I was trying

[19:55] <TreyHarris> to write bridges to fix this behavior along with methods that used directly via Inline::Perl5 results in broken list-return behavior.

[19:57] <TreyHarris> jnthn: samewith has exactly the same behavior as nextwith and callwith I wrote in my comment notes.

[19:57] <jnthn> *nod*

[19:58] <jnthn> So, MOP-y stuff is likely the best way

[19:58] <jnthn> m: multi trait_mod:<is>(Method:D $m, :$auto-new!) { $m.wrap: -> \obj, |c { callwith(obj.DEFINITE ?? obj !! obj.new, |c) } }; class C { has $.x = 0; method m() is auto-new { say $!x } }; C.m; C.new.m

[19:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d0924f: OUTPUT: «0␤0␤»

[19:58] <jnthn> That's probably the minimal way

[19:58] <jnthn> With a little more effort you can make it into a class trait

[19:59] <jnthn> So you only have to put "is auto-new" on the class, not on each method

[19:59] <jnthn> Though maybe that's too sweeping

[19:59] <jnthn> But it gets away from having to to :U/:D stuff and re-mention the method name

[19:59] <jnthn> m: multi trait_mod:<is>(Method:D $m, :$auto-new!) { $m.wrap: -> \obj, |c { callwith(obj.DEFINITE ?? obj !! obj.new, |c) } }; class C { has $.x = 0; method m() is auto-new { say $!x } }; C.m; C.new(x => 42).m # just checking :)

[20:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar d0924f: OUTPUT: «0␤42␤»

[20:00] <jnthn> phew :)

[20:00] <TreyHarris> but with that I'd write: use Whatever:from<Perl5>; class P6::Whatever is Whatever { method fields is auto-new { nextsame; } }

[20:00] <nine> TreyHarris: feel free to ping me if there's anything I can do on the Inline::Perl5 side.

[20:00] <jnthn> Do you need it to be a subclass?

[20:01] <jnthn> And to respond correctly to .can?

[20:01] <jnthn> If those don't matter than there's just wrapping it up and using FALLBACK

[20:02] <TreyHarris> jnthn: "need"? Perl5 objects don't respond correctly to .can. But I would like to avoid rewriting the names of methods whose behavior I don't need to change

[20:04] <TreyHarris> nine: my biggest issue has been with methods that return lists... the container they return is very odd. comparing 'my $t = FromP5.new.listy(); my @t = FromP5.new.listy();' is strange. Neither is directly iterable, but $t.elems is correct and $t can be indexed, while @t.elems is 1 and the single element is another list. I've dealt with this by wrapping such methods in 'method listy (--> Slip(Any)) { return

[20:05] <TreyHarris> Also, oddly, 'my $obj = FromP5.new; $obj.listy() === $obj.listy() or die' dies, as does eqv and =:=

[20:08] <TreyHarris> Oh! Sorry, only when something within the overall object is in XS. Hope you weren't writing your own test for this. (Proc::ProcessTable is a very simple thing to see this behavior.)

[20:09] <TreyHarris> Proc::ProcessTable.new.table shows this behavior for instance.

[20:10] <TreyHarris> Pure Perl5 seems to get translated okay.

[20:10] <nine> TreyHarris: that sounds odd. Perl 5 arrays get wrapped in a Perl5Array object which does Iterable and Positional

[20:17] <TreyHarris> (must go for ~1hr, sorry)

[20:19] <nine> TreyHarris: if those wrappers misbehave, you can also just .list them

[20:22] <TreyHarris> nine oops sorry on phone so briefly: yes positional and iterable but the @version only has single element, @var[0] is actual list. Is why I used a Slip(Annie) return type

[20:23] <TreyHarris> *Any

[20:23] <nine> my @t = Proc::ProcessTable.new.table.list

[20:23] <nine> ^^^ does what you need

[20:26] <nine> Aaaand I may have a patch that fixes the issue altogether

[20:26] <nine> Just have to sprinkle some "is raw" to avoid containerization of the Perl5Array return object.

[20:30] <TreyHarris> nine: I see. .fields does not exhibit this behavior because its structure is pure Perl. But I can do a trait that just puts ".list" at the end of everything; I do enough maps and greps and such in code that having to put .list in each place it should go will be annoying. Got to write an override either way; not sure if "method table (--> Slip(Any)) { $p5obj.table }" or "method table() { $p5obj.table.list }" is

[20:30] <TreyHarris> better. First is a few chars shorter, so it wins? :-)

[20:31] <nine> TreyHarris: I already have a patch for making my @t = Proc::ProcessTable.new.table; do what you need. Just need to write a test for it.

[20:33] <nine> Writing a test seems to be the harder part actually...

[20:34] <TreyHarris> nine: Always is the case innit

[20:53] <nine> Can't get the darned thing to fail :) And I also don't see why it should make a difference if a sub is in XS or pure Perl. They all just push onto the stack and Inline::Perl5 doesn't even know what exactly it is.

[20:59] <nine> Ooooh...of course! Proc::ProcessTable::table returns an array ref, not just an array.

[21:00] <nine> TreyHarris: I wonder if Inline::Perl5 is actually correct there. A Perl 5 array reference sounds like it's closer to an itemized Perl 6 array than a flat one.

[21:09] *** RabidGravy left
[21:11] <TreyHarris> nine: It's arguably "closer" but it's far, far more unwieldy (unless you know to just never use it until you use .list). In Perl5, the most you need do is add an @-sign to get it to work with built-ins, for, etc. In Perl 6, I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out if there was any way to assign it to an @array. Even '@a = ...table; @a = @a[0]; @a = @a[0]; say @a.elems' still gave you the same darn thing.

[21:12] *** ufobat left
[21:16] *** jdmmmmm left
[21:18] <TreyHarris> nine: In fact, you can't delay the '.list'. "my @a = ...table; say @a.list.elems # 1" is just as unusable. You have to do ".list" at call-time or wrap it in a Slip(Any). Otherwise, you're stuck with something that's uniterable and un-flat()-enable and only indexable through @a[0][$n], though @a[0] itself isn't iterable. It really, really confused me for a long time
