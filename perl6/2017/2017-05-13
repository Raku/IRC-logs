[02:04] <samcv> what should I use instead of exec? if i need to start a program that needs user input

[02:05] <samcv> start the program then when it's done return control back to the P6 script

[02:06] <samcv> if i don't capture :out, :in will it magically go through? i'd never tried it... not sure . on nice! it works

[02:06] <Zoffix> That's not what exec does. It doesn't return. You can just not specify `:in` and it'll use the parent's STDIN

[02:07] <Zoffix> $ perl6 -e 'run(:out, $*EXECUTABLE, "-e", "say q|Got: |, get").out.slurp(:close).say'

[02:07] <samcv> yes i know

[02:07] <Zoffix> meow

[02:07] <Zoffix> Got: meow

[02:07] <samcv> but there is no exec so i need alternatives

[02:07] <samcv> and that works fine

[12:47] <masak> macros watch: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14329249 -- this would indeed be a reasonable use for macros, I think.

[12:47] <yoleaux> 11 May 2017 03:07Z <MasterDuke_> masak: the inconsistent examples in https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122990 now are errors. e.g., `say \(1) ~~ :(int as Str)` gives `===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e Malformed parameter at -e:1 ------> say \(1) ~~ :(int⏏ as Str)     expecting any of:         constraint         formal parameter`. is that ok or should the ticket be re-worded to make them work at all?

[12:47] <masak> though would need to measure before/after so it's not just a microoptimization

[12:48] <masak> MasterDuke_: I don't know. why are they now parse errors?

[12:49] <masak> is it because we no longer have the `as` syntax?

[12:49] <masak> maybe it should be `Str(int)` ?

[12:49] <masak> m: :(Str(int))

[12:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4c8136: ( no output )

[13:08] <fatguy> i tried simple program to convert seconds to h:m:s https://pastebin.com/WuaaX3mH , got error "expected a writable container, but got IntStr value" , can someone guide me what's wrong

[13:09] *** darutoko- left
[13:09] <AlexDaniel> fatguy: maybe you want polymod instead https://docs.perl6.org/routine/polymod

[13:09] <AlexDaniel> fatguy: but let's see what's wrong with your code… one second :)

[13:09] *** pierre_ joined
[13:09] <AlexDaniel> fatguy: ah, you probably need ｢Int $seconds is copy｣

[13:10] <AlexDaniel> fatguy: so “is copy” instead of “is rw”

[13:10] <fatguy> i'm doing 'think perl 6' book exercise, i haven't learn what is polymod

[13:10] *** poohman left
[13:10] <fatguy> oh i thought i can do rw, so i can pass reference

[13:10] *** poohman joined
[13:11] <AlexDaniel> fatguy: you can! But your $seconds come from MAIN

[13:11] <AlexDaniel> soo… perhaps you'll need “sub MAIN (Int $seconds is copy)” ?

[13:13] <AlexDaniel> yea, that works

[13:13] <fatguy> AlexDaniel: ouch, ya, ok, make sense. thx Alex/Daniel

[13:51] <masak> oh, that's interesting

[13:51] <pink_mist> timotimo: https://metacpan.org/release/HMBRAND/Text-CSV-0.007

[13:51] <masak> how do we make the tools not think that next time?

[13:51] <timotimo> is that perl6?

[13:52] <tadzik> pink_mist: he's here, yes

[13:52] <timotimo> only a few people actually put real perl6 stuff up on cpan

[13:52] <timotimo> i believe nine puts Inline::Perl5 there? or is that just Inline::Perl6?

[14:35] <timotimo> yeah, use a my \var

[21:58] <samcv> ugh i keep getting these errors that make no sense. there must be somewhere messing the code up

[22:10] <samcv> i think sometimes the error messages can be a little different if you have one variable $package and one $package-mask (when you have some other errros i the file)

[22:11] <samcv> got it though
