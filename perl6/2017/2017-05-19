[10:59] <tbrowder> hi #perl6

[11:03] <tbrowder> i notice that, according to the docs, perl6 pod can be rendered as a man page, but i don't see a Pod::To::Man module listed. maybe zef can someday automagically install man pages on *nix systems.

[11:04] <moritz> maybe start by writing Pod::To::Man? :-)

[11:05] *** imcsk8 joined
[11:05] <tbrowder> but how is that done now with the --man option?

[11:07] <tbrowder> i assume there must be one or more of the pod6 man sections in the code, but something must be rendering that to man format--or not, just text in man format i guess--haven't tried it.

[11:08] <moritz> which --man option?

[11:09] <tbrowder>  see the docs, language, pod, bottom of the page: rendering pod

[11:11] <moritz> that will just use the normal --pod output

[11:11] <moritz> so it uses Pod::To::Text

[11:11] <tbrowder> ok, thanks

[13:52] <robertle> are there any guarantees around .tap executions on the same supply in terms of concurrency? can I rely on the block within the tap code to not be executed in parallel?

[13:52] <moritz> robertle: iirc you can if you use .act instead of .tap

[13:54] <jnthn> Supplies are by default serial

[13:54] <jnthn> You *can* find a way to get a supply that won't deliver messages one at a time

[13:55] <jnthn> But by default they process one message at a time

[13:55] <jnthn> (The way being the unsanitized-Supply method or whatever it's called on Supplier)

[13:55] <robertle> super, thanks!

[13:55] <jnthn> .act promises it even then

[13:55] <jnthn> But you're pretty safe with tap

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ doc: the-eater++ created pull request #1315: Add docs for Proc::Async.ready

[20:05] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/1315

[20:07] <webart> feeds ... ("==>") ... when are they useful?  

[20:08] <webart> I like the "style" of he syntax for some reason   

[20:11] <perlpilot> webart: they're currently useful when you want to better indicate data flow in your code

[20:11] <webart> since it seems like you are building a sort of processing pipeline 

[20:12] <perlpilot> webart: or change the direction of flow to be more "natural"

[20:12] <webart> yeah ok

[20:12] <webart> perl6 -e 'say "/usr/share/dict/words".IO.slurp.lines.grep("zygote") ' takes .8 seconds

[20:13] <mst> I bet most of that is startup overhead

[20:13] <webart> perl6 -e 'my @arr = "/usr/share/dict/words".IO.slurp.lines(:eager) ;  @arr ==> grep({m/<<zygote>>/}) ==> my $stuff; say $stuff'  

[20:13] <webart> takes 20 seconds :-)

[20:13] <webart> ok very bad example 

[20:13] <webart> mst: agreed

[20:13] <mst> also what about

[20:13] <webart> startup time

[20:14] <mst> "/usr/share/dict/words".IO.slurp.lines(:eager).grep("zygote") ?

[20:14] *** andrzejku left
[20:14] * mst suspects it's the eagerness that's screwing the performance in the second case

[20:14] <webart> I thought maybe ==> was optimized for something esoteric  along with what perlpilot mentioned

[20:15] <perlpilot> webart: there's a promise of parallelization, but I don't think it's implemented yet.

[20:16] <webart>   obviously using ==> grep() instead of .grep() is dumb but I wondered if there was some performance area where it excelled

[20:16] <webart> perlpilot: aha! that is it!

[20:16] <perlpilot> S06 has some info on feed ops and what's guaranteed or not

[20:16] <perlpilot> I dunno if any of that made it to docs.perl6.org  though

[20:18] <webart> perlpilot: one day massive networked AI in the sky applications will use it :)

[20:18] <webart> to "feed" on us 8-{

[20:21] <perlpilot> webart: If you have interest in using the feed ops for their implicit parallelization that is not yet implemented, you could take jnthn up on his offer (https://6guts.wordpress.com/2017/05/12/looking-for-perl-6-rakudo-and-moarvm-development-funding/) and fund him to make it happen  :-)

[20:22] <webart> :-D  excellent

[21:13] <jnthn> Was certianly a warm/clear day up here in Prague. :)

[22:16] <Zoffix> webart: where did you learn about `:eager` argument for .lines?

[22:18] <Geth> ¦ doc: e016b7efc0 | eater++ (committed by Zoffix Znet) | doc/Type/Proc/Async.pod6

[22:18] <Geth> ¦ doc: Add docs for Proc::Async.ready (#1315)

[22:18] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/e016b7efc0

[22:26] <Zoffix> hythm: no difference, other than `defined $foo, $bar` will be an error and will require parens: `defined($foo), $bar`. Perl 6 has many routines for those who prefer "functional" programing, which just delegete to a method call, in this case, `defined $foo` just calls `$foo.defined`

[22:27] <Zoffix> hythm: so defined my $var1 ?? "y" !! "n" is same as `defined( my $var1 ?? "y" !! "n" )` 

[22:27] <Zoffix> And is always true

[22:30] <Zoffix> zostay: FWIW, »... is not the same as .map(*...). Hyper will descend into iterables for nodal methods, while .map won't. 

[22:30] <Zoffix> m: dd (^3, [^4], '5')».Numeric

[22:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7c23a: OUTPUT: «($(0, 1, 2), $[0, 1, 2, 3], 5)␤»

[22:30] <Zoffix> m: dd (^3, [^4], '5').map: *.Numeric

[22:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7c23a: OUTPUT: «(3, 4, 5).Seq␤»

[22:35] <Zoffix> or rather... methods that are nodal will descend

[22:36] <Zoffix> m: dd (^3, [^4], '5')».[0]

[22:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7c23a: OUTPUT: «(0, 0, "5")␤»

[22:36] <Zoffix> m: dd (^3, [^4], '5')».head

[22:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar a7c23a: OUTPUT: «($(0, 1, 2), $[0, 1, 2, 3], "5")␤»

[22:39] <Zoffix> webart: anyway, reason I asked is because there's no (longer) such an arg and if any no-archived materials mention it they need to be updated
