[01:15] <comborico1611> I'm back. Good supper. Homemade hamburgers.

[01:15] <ivans> sounds nice

[01:15] <ivans> what did you put in them?

[01:15] <comborico1611> They are so easy and fast to make, as well.

[01:16] <comborico1611> Salt and pepper, onions, ketchup. 

[01:17] <comborico1611> My brother actually puts ingredients IN the meat.  Wortstershire, i forgot the rest.

[01:17] <ivans> it's weird how homemeade food tastes so good

[01:17] <ivans> even if it's the simplest thing in the world

[01:18] <lookatme> China hamburgers :)

[01:18] <comborico1611> For some foods homemade is amazing. For others, not as good as professional. I'm thinking steak here.

[01:18] <ivans> for sure, there's a place for professionals

[01:19] <ivans> one of the best meals I ever had was a nice big steak in canada

[01:20] <ivans> I've noticed some active people on projecteuler.net using Perl 6, is anyone of them on this channel? :)

[01:20] <ivans> the solutions I've seen on the forums is a big reason I'm interested in Perl 6 again

[01:20] <ivans> looks like a proper useful language now

[01:21] <comborico1611> Not me. I'm not that into math.

[01:21] <comborico1611> What about China hamburgers?

[01:22] <ivans> I have no clue what that would be

[01:22] <ivans> TIL

[01:22] <MasterDuke> heh. i was working on a projecteuler.net problem in Perl 6 and it wasn't running fast enough. i started looking into the rakudo compiler and ended up contributing to Rakudo, NQP, and MoarVM

[01:22] *** troys is now known as troys_

[01:22] <MasterDuke> but still haven't solved that problem

[01:22] <timotimo> i imagine china hamburgers are really hard to chew and also cut up your mouth from the inside when you try to eat them

[01:22] <comborico1611> Heh

[01:22] <ivans> MasterDuke: :D

[01:23] <ivans> I really like chinese food in general

[01:23] <comborico1611> I need to go back a self-study mathematics.

[01:23] <ivans> had some just the day before

[01:24] <comborico1611> American Chinese food is the best.

[01:24] <ivans> comborico1611: I'm studying (re-learning) math on my own right now

[01:24] <lookatme> If you interesting in china food, I recommend you watch video of "The food ranger" on the Youtube

[01:24] <comborico1611> What branch are you in now?

[01:24] <ivans> "mathematics and its history" is a very nice book to get an overview of different areas

[01:25] <comborico1611> Lookatme, ty I'll check it now.

[01:25] <ivans> I skimmed through it once, now I'm reading it again carefully

[01:25] <comborico1611> Hmm. I love history, so that sounds great.

[01:25] <ivans> it's a really nice splend of history and actual math

[01:26] <ivans> I think it'll take me a year to finish this careful second reading

[01:26] <comborico1611> I bought a math book that sounds similar. It is a classic. Can't remember the name. Not sure why i didn't finish it.

[01:27] <ivans> I've started 50 math books for every one I've finished

[01:27] *** ryn1x_ left
[01:27] <ivans> so nowadays when I pick up a new one, I'll plan to read it twice

[01:28] <comborico1611> I believe it. For me, Math is a subject that has to have a talented teacher, or i don't understand.

[01:28] <ivans> first time I'll skip everything that's too complicated and just skim

[01:28] <comborico1611> That is a wise strategy.

[01:28] <ivans> and if I liked the 1% I understood, I'll go over it again

[01:28] <ivans> incidentally, I re-read "How to read a book" this year

[01:28] <comborico1611> Hmm.

[01:29] *** margeas left
[01:29] <comborico1611> I never thought to study such a subject. Makes really good sense to, now that i think about it.

[01:29] <lookatme> Also I heard there is a snack bar under the Empire State Building in NewYork sold China hamburgers from ShanXi (China city).

[01:30] <comborico1611> Heh. 

[01:30] <ivans> if I ever visit the US, I'll check it out :

[01:30] <ivans> :D

[01:30] <ivans> the images I got from google look tasty

[01:30] <ivans> just like most asian food

[01:31] <lookatme> Yeah, if you want try Chinese food, welcome to China :)

[01:31] <comborico1611> Asian food is the best in the world. Then, Mexican.

[01:32] <timotimo> the best pizza i had in recent memory was from a chinese restaurant (for delivery)

[01:32] <comborico1611> üòÜ

[01:33] <MasterDuke> heh. the best neapolitan pizza i ever had was in tallin, estonia. better than the place in naples, italy where the pizza was invented

[01:36] <MasterDuke> chicago-style is actually my favorite. i was just in nyc, but i don't really like their pizza

[01:36] <ivans> I've been travelling for quite a few years now

[01:36] <ivans> nothing's better than local asian food

[01:38] <MasterDuke> i've never been to that part of asia, but would love to get there sometime

[01:38] *** kalkin-- joined
[01:38] <comborico1611> I must be in the mood for Chicago (deep dish) pizza. 

[01:39] <ivans> I've managed to find surprisingly good pizza everywhere in south-east asia I've been

[01:39] <ivans> even my Italian friend had no complaints, and that's saying a lot

[01:40] <comborico1611> lol

[01:40] <ivans> there are so many expats that decide to buy a restaurant and show how it's really done

[05:20] <piojo> Is there any way to do a parallel "for" loop? This doesn't work: for @objects.race { }

[05:20] <piojo> I've been using .race.map (conceptually this is a mismatch), or for @objects { start { ... } } (this is slower)

[05:21] <geekosaur> you may be looking for hyperoperators?

[05:21] *** Cabanossi left
[05:21] <piojo> geekosaur: don't those only work with functions/operators?

[05:22] <piojo> I couldn't get hyper operators to work with a block, but perhaps my syntax was just wrong

[05:22] *** Cabanossi joined
[05:26] <geekosaur> I'm not sure if you need to define your own operator to make the syntax work. think there's some evil abuse of [] ?

[05:28] *** cdg joined
[05:29] <piojo> geekosaur: abusing `map` (using it in sink context) is less evil than abusing operators. Unless there's something I just missed in the docs, like @a¬ª.{ ... }

[05:33] *** cdg left
[05:33] <piojo> is there a method which invokes a block, like a method version of `given`?

[05:34] <piojo> this definitely doesn't work: <a b c>¬ª.given( -> $obj { logic here })

[05:37] <geekosaur> actually, I think you just want the example for race. map and for are not so different

[05:38] *** ryn1x joined
[05:38] *** mempko joined
[05:39] <geekosaur> in fact, in the perl 5 community there's a thing about people using map instead of for, which is wasteful because it builds a result list only to throw it away

[05:39] *** wamba left
[05:39] <geekosaur> but iirc in perl 6 for builds the result list anyway, so not even that difference

[05:39] <piojo> geekosaur: but in perl6 it's faster to use .race.map than to call 'await do for { start { } }'

[05:39] <piojo> oh, I didn't realize calling map wasn't wasteful

[05:42] *** ryn1x left
[05:46] *** napo1eon joined
[05:57] <piojo> still, this is such awkward syntax, there should be a better way. I think I'll ask on SO

[05:58] <piojo> IMO, calling map in a sink context should give a warning, since it's likely that `@foo.map` should be `@bar = @foo.map`

[05:59] <piojo> but it's still the fastest way to do concurrent iteration with a block

[05:59] <geekosaur> yeh. it's actually worse than that, we tend to rely on stuff in sink context doing something (at least wrning) but a list or hash that is sunk silently vanishes

[06:00] <geekosaur> which includes, say, Failure-s embedded in the list/hash

[06:00] <geekosaur> so they never throw

[06:32] <piojo> geekosaur: oh, that is quite bad

[06:33] <geekosaur> the flip side is you don't want to wait for everything in a 1000000 element list to be sunk

[06:34] <geekosaur> which makes me wonder if things like for need to be aware of their context and propagate it to the block

[06:34] <geekosaur> but that probably has its own problems

[06:34] <piojo> Also, I notice "await do for @foo { start { ... } }" also does not print failures

[06:35] <piojo> so that makes the "map" case less problematic, if the competition exhibits the same symptom

[08:12] <wander> do we have Class like bitset?

[08:12] <wander> or say bitmap

[08:12] <moritz> this was with rakudo 2017.10-132-g1c38715

[08:12] *** Mrofnet left
[08:13] <lookatme> Here is  This is Rakudo version 2017.10 built on MoarVM version 2017.10

[08:14] <piojo> lookatme: the actual example is searching a file: $path.IO.slurp.contains($str)

[08:15] <piojo> It's a little slower, and it shows the difference between .race.map and await do for { start { } }, though they're both much faster than normal loop

[08:15] <lookatme> I haven't seen bitmap in docs 

[08:16] <TEttinger> wander: what's the purpose you have in mind? I wonder if binding Roaring would make sense if you want compressed bitsets

[08:17] <TEttinger> Roaring is interesting among all the bitset libs out there because it has a not-super-tiny amount of overhead per bitset, but can compress large bitsets much better

[08:18] <lookatme> Unfortunately, the for + start is the slowest in my pc, it took 45s

[08:19] <TEttinger> EWAH, which is used in some form by Git, has much less overhead per bitset but less compression. I have some crazy code that uses a simpler version of EWAH's RLE-type encoding, but uses it for 2D data and can generally compress spatially nearby areas into one 16-bit "all on" section, and keep most of the rest in one or a few "all off" sections

[08:24] *** domidumont joined
[08:25] <piojo> @moritz, I don't think hyper even works right on my computer. it's much too fast, and I don't think the block even gets executed

[08:25] <wander> I need a bitset to hold a state vector

[08:47] <lookatme> It works on my pc

[08:48] <wander> ok I can build a mask full of 1 at first

[08:48] <piojo> Oh, it only fails in the REPL

[08:48] <piojo> But I've had strange results from "hyper" ever since I discovered what it was. Still, I need to upgrade.

[08:51] <lookatme> m: my Int $a = 0; $a +|= (1 +< 1000); say $a.base(2)

[09:58] <moritz> what's the ticket in question?

[09:59] <moritz> and why do you want to close it?

[10:00] <piojo> moritz: I would be grateful if you could close this for me: https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132447

[10:00] <moritz> correction: I can't right now, because RT doesn't let me log in :(

[10:00] <piojo> because the bug I made such a careful testcase for is no longer happening with the newest build.

[10:01] <moritz> then we should still have a test before we close the issue

[10:01] <moritz> just send a mail that the problem is fixed on newest rakudo

[10:01] <piojo> oh, I need to reply to the auto-send, don't I?

[10:02] <piojo> moritz: I think this one would be hard to test for. My test case needs to be run repeatedly in a bash loop until it fails

[10:02] <piojo> In fact, I can't guarantee it was fixed. All I can say is that I can't reproduce on the a fresh build of the master branch.

[12:50] <tyil> I havent used Cro yet, so I cant really comment on whether its good or not :(

[12:51] <piojo_> I can't comment very much because I haven't used any other web services framework

[12:51] <ZzZombo> Can this be simplified? Need to return either a item type specific localized string, or from fallback object, or a decorated token as last resort.

[12:51] <ZzZombo> return .value with ($localization{$item} && $localization{$item}{$type} && $localization{$item}{$type}{$note} || Nil,$localization{$type} && $localization{$type}{$note} || Nil).first({.defined && .isa(Grammar::VDF::Key-Value)});

[12:51] <ZzZombo> 		"#$note";

[12:51] *** wander joined
[12:51] *** Actualeyes joined
[12:51] <piojo_> But I do like that it's synchronous, and it seems like most of the other modern web frameworks want to be async

[12:52] <wander> .

[12:53] <ZzZombo> I just noticed I can replace the argument to `first` with just `*.isa(Grammar::VDF::Key-Value)`, but anything else?

[12:56] <tyil> cant you shorten the entire first part with the && to just the last one, and replace the || with //

[12:57] <tyil> so `$localization{$item} && $localization{$item}{$type} && $localization{$item}{$type}{$note} ||` becomes `$localization{$item}{$type}{$note} //`

[12:57] <ZzZombo> no, if an intermediate element doesn't exist, accessing its contents is illegal.

[12:58] <ZzZombo> it's not a Hash.

[12:58] <ZzZombo> It's an instance of a custom class.

[12:59] <ZzZombo> It just happens to do the magic necessary to make subscript access work with it.

[13:00] <tyil> I wouldn't call it magic :p

[13:00] <moritz> it's magic until you understand how it works :-)

[13:01] *** ryn1x joined
[13:02] <ilmari> what does it return for non-existing elements? why not just return something like Any, which itself returns Any on any subscripting

[13:03] <ilmari> or you could make it return Nil

[13:03] <ZzZombo> It returns Nil.

[13:04] <ZzZombo> Maybe yea

[13:05] <ilmari> well, Nil allows subscrpting and just returns Nil, so even the // is unnecessary

[13:05] <moritz> the magic really happens when you start writing ot it

[13:05] <moritz> *to it

[13:05] <ZzZombo> I forgot about that, I don't need the `|| Nil`

[13:05] *** ryn1x left

[15:26] <[Coke]> maybe we can do that for this year's crop, add a small banner showing the language spec and rakudo version any code was run with)

[16:00] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/d60cefdbd100d097eec78663b5a97b26

[16:00] <timotimo> alternatively, can you run this with perl6-gdb-m?

[16:00] <comborico1611> Ho, moritz. Still making good ground on your book?

[16:01] <timotimo> then you would "break io.c:144

[16:01] <timotimo> oh, but then you'll need debug info or it'll be annoying AF to find a reference to the actual object

[16:01] <timotimo> also, --debug=0 in moarvm's compiler flags

[16:01] <timotimo> anyway, the patch is easier; gotta run!

[16:02] <ZzZombo> I could, but it's pretty late here, I hoped to wrap things up for today when this issue cropped up.

[16:02] <ZzZombo> I'm not sure how to apply the patch, I need to build from source, right? And that's gonna be for sure a pin on Windows?

[16:02] <ZzZombo> pain*

[16:04] <ZzZombo> I can only add that I'm trying to save a file in UTF-16LE encoding, via `IO.spurt`.

[16:04] <ZzZombo> The same code path works for UTF-8 fine.

[16:08] <moritz> comborico1611: yes, progress is fine
