[03:50] <geekosaur> you chose a bad time to build from git, I think

[03:50] <aeruder> heh

[03:50] <geekosaur> BUILDALL's being reworked. this sounds like Zef needs to be updated to match

[10:29] <tyil> geekosaur, jnthn: I wrote a small article on how I solved the forking issue, and I have added quotes to you both, do you guys mind if I publish this on my site?

[10:30] <tyil> its reviewable here if you want to take a look first: https://github.com/Tyil/website/blob/master/_tutorials/perl6-creating-a-background-service.adoc

[10:33] <lizmat> tyil: why not a "proper" blog post ?  :-)

[10:33] <tyil> lizmat: if they are ok with me quoting them, it'll become a real post on my site

[10:33] <lizmat> ok, cool  :-)

[10:34] <tyil> that is just the source that'll be turned into a post, but I don't want to publish it until I know they're ok with it :>

[10:35] <tyil> I'll post it on twitter with a10 #perl6 once it goes up

[10:35] <tyil> (and mastodon)

[10:35] <lizmat> :-)

[10:35] <Xliff> 6lang.... I kinda like it.

[10:36] <Xliff> Although you will have to rip "Perl6" from my cold, dead hands.

[10:36] <tyil> Xliff: while I like the perl 6 name, I've come to understand those wanting to tweak the name more with everyone I try to explain that perl 6 is not the same as perl 5

[10:37] <tyil> as if the false preconceptions against the name "perl" in general weren't bad enough ;~;

[10:39] <Xliff> tyil: Oh, I understand that aspect of it.

[10:40] <Xliff> However, I've never thought of Perl as a "four letter word".

[10:40] <Xliff> I've always loved it.

[10:40] *** astj joined
[10:41] <Xliff> I can do more in Perl5 and 6lang than I can do in any other language with less code.

[10:41] <tyil> me mostly with 6lang

[10:41] *** araujo joined
[10:41] <tyil> I'm not that well versed with either perl version as some of the veterans in here

[10:41] <tyil> but 6lang feels powerful, and I find it easy to convert my ideas to code in 6lang

[10:41] <Xliff> Well, it's been a while since I've done Perl 5 coding.

[10:42] <tyil> much easier than with langs like python, ruby or php

[10:42] <Xliff> And as of now, I prefer 6lang to P5.

[10:42] <tyil> same

[10:42] <Xliff> Still. 

[10:42] <tyil> the only thing I'm missing is 6lang being installed by default on most distros :p

[10:42] <Xliff> 6lang has some quirks I wanna strangle it for.

[10:43] *** headcase left
[10:43] <Xliff> BUILD/TWEAK were my most recent nemesis. But now I grok them.

[10:43] *** xtreak left
[10:44] <Xliff> Supply, Channel, await and others of that ilk still loom before me.

[10:44] <lizmat> Xliff: ooc, what aspect of BUILD/TWEAK gave you problems?

[10:44] <Xliff> I have nibbled around those edges and get the heebs.

[10:45] *** astj left
[10:45] <Xliff> lizmat: Well, namely that I was trying to do things in BUILD/new that I needed TWEAK for, and I didn't know it even existed!

[10:45] <Xliff> Rather, I read a passing mention of them in the docs and quickly forgot about it.

[10:45] <lizmat> TWEAK was a rather recent addition

[10:45] <Xliff> Ah.

[10:45] <tyil> Xliff: my most recent quirk was that I cannot fork a 6lang program into the background as you'd do for services

[10:46] <Xliff> Because I was trying to do things in BUILD that it was not meant for... namely callwith/nextwith

[10:46] *** chakli left
[10:46] <Xliff> tyil: Yes. I have been following that. I take it you've had luck. Oh. I need to read your post.

[10:46] <tyil> its a draft thus until I push it to my webserver

[10:48] <Ulti> tyil: there's also http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/

[10:49] <Ulti> everyone always forgets the change working directory which always comes back to haunt them a decade later

[10:50] <Zoffix> Xliff: no one's ripping "Perl 6" out of any hands :) 6lang is (potentially) the second name. Similar to how Canada has both English and French as official languages :)

[10:51] <Xliff> Zoffix: Well good! That's the way it SHOULD be! ^_^

[10:51] <tyil> Ulti: interesting

[10:51] <Zoffix> .oO( TMTOWTNI )

[10:51] <Xliff> tyil: Nifty post. Most of the tricks there I already knew, but that was a nice writeup!

[10:51] <Xliff> In this situation, couldn't you get the forked script to write out its own PID file?

[10:51] <tyil> Ulti: I mostly went for the posix sh so that it can be used in every real OS without extra deps

[10:52] <tyil> Xliff: yes

[10:52] <tyil> you can, but you dont need to :p

[10:52] <Xliff> *shrug*

[10:52] <tyil> timtowtdi extends to the shell too if you really want

[10:52] <Xliff> Well, you said "SOL! LOL" (basically) so I was offering that as an alternative. :P

[11:55] <noobie_> Hi. What is the best way to download large binary files in Perl6? I'm looking for something similar to PHP's stream_copy_to_stream.

[12:01] *** HoboWithAShotgun joined
[12:02] <timotimo> we don't have a "sendfile" op yet; that's the linux sys call that asks the kernel to suck data out of one file descriptor and spit it out into another

[12:02] *** Zoffix left
[12:02] <timotimo> it's not standardised, though, i.e. not portable

[12:03] <timotimo> oh, it looks like stream_copy_to_stream in php doesn't do that

[12:04] <timotimo> it also seems to be rather wasteful on memory

[12:05] <timotimo> hm, maybe splice is better than sendfile

[12:05] <noobie_> Currently I'm using a combination of LWP::Simple.get and spurt, which works well for small files only.

[12:05] <timotimo> (which is also not portable)

[12:06] <jnthn> The Cro HTTP client lets you get the body as a Supply

[12:06] <jnthn> Which spits out the data as it arrives

[12:06] <jnthn> And so you can write each chunk into a file

[12:07] <timotimo> aye, LWP::Simple doesn't know anything other than returning all data as a single string or buffer

[12:08] *** nadim left
[12:10] <noobie_> Cro::HTTP::Client sounds good to me. I'll give it a try. So this is the best option I have, I assume?

[12:10] *** nadim joined
[12:11] <timotimo> it's a young module, but it's Very Good‚Ñ¢

[13:01] <Xliff> Is there some way that the precompile cache could get corrupted?

[13:02] <Xliff> I have been working on my own code, but sometime in the last 18 hours a bug creeped in that seems to be affecting HTTP::UserAgent. At least the error appears in HTTP::UserAgent, and it doesn't make any sense.

[13:02] *** cdg left
[13:02] <Xliff> Cannot find method 'sink': no method cache and no .^find_method

[13:02] <Xliff>   in method request at /home/cbwood/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6/site/sources/550EDE9A5964CAD65D8DE06101C62DC9A1145D0A (HTTP::UserAgent) line 150

[13:03] <Xliff> Now I've run the test suite for HTTP::UserAgent, and everything runs fine.

[13:03] <Xliff> I've also just rakudobrewed.

[13:06] <Xliff> Reason I am asking is because the code where the error occured, was not directly related to any of the code changes I made.

[13:07] <timotimo> jnthn: on the cro http client docs page there's a wikipedia link to "Byteordermark" :)

[13:07] <timotimo> hm, the formatting didn't come through, did it?

[13:08] <timotimo> anyway, the _ in the link are interpreted as italic markers for the middle word

[13:09] <lizmat> Xliff: you could try reverting the commits marked Stage X of auto-generated BUILDALL

[13:09] <tyil> jnthn: I saw your commit, nice

[13:10] <jnthn> timotimo: Probably a Text::Markdown bug

[13:10] <tyil> now just gotta get an okay from geekosaur to include his quote and I can publish the article

[13:10] <timotimo> probably just have to mark the whole thing as a link

[13:11] <Xliff> lizmat: I am hoping I don't need to go that far into the trees.

[13:11] <Xliff> I am just wondering why working code just suddenly... stopped working.

[13:12] <Xliff> Now the script I was working on, which was running, but errored due to badly parsed date, is now erroring out in a place that it was originally working in.

[13:12] <Xliff> What's the best way to force all modules to recompile without blowing away all of .rakudobrew and starting over?

[13:58] <unclechu> hey guys, what's better to use inside promises? `sleep n` or `await Promise.in: n`?

[13:58] <unclechu> is there any difference?

[13:58] *** headcase joined
[14:00] <jnthn> await Promise.in: n

[14:00] <jnthn> sleep is really sleep; it blocks the thread for reals

[14:00] <unclechu> jnthn: okay, any explanation? maybe `sleep` blocks whole process while `Promise.in` just based on event-loop?

[14:00] <jnthn> In Perl 6.d (use v6.d.PREVIEW), await is non-blocking, and so using await Promise.in: n won't block up a real thread.

[14:01] <unclechu> jnthn: okay, thanks

[14:01] <jnthn> So it'll let you get away with less real threads, and so save memory

[14:01] *** epony joined
[14:02] <lizmat> jnthn: should sleep be expressed in Promise.in in 6.d ?

[14:02] <lizmat> *as

[14:02] <jnthn> No, I've already ruled on that.

[14:02] <lizmat> ok

[14:04] <jnthn> We need a way to be able to do the real sleep also, and I don't think there's a better name for it than sleep :)

[14:08] <lizmat> perhaps we need a snooze()

[14:09] <lizmat> Promise.in(5) etc seems pretty long and not something that is easily findable for newbies

[14:10] *** HoboWithAShotgun left
[14:11] <jnthn> How would snooze be more findable?

[14:19] *** ryn1x left
[14:20] <Xliff> What does this error message really mean "Cannot find method 'sink': no method cache and no .^find_method

[14:20] <unclechu> lizmat: got it, thanks

[14:20] <El_Che> if there is a thing I love about Zoffix it is his perseverance

[14:20] <unclechu> but what would be the best way to do some stuff of my app in background?

[14:21] <donaldh> also http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/threads-and-fork-think-twice-before-using-them

[14:22] <lizmat> Xliff: that usually means something from NQP slipped into HLL land in void context

[14:23] *** eliv left
[14:24] * donaldh was just caught out by multi candidate with named params always winning over those without, even when not provided in call.

[14:25] <donaldh> It would be helpful to get a warning that a multi candidate is shadowed and will never be called.

[14:27] <Xliff> lizmat: Something like this?

[14:28] <Xliff>  X::HTTP::Response.new(:rc('Max redirects exceeded'), :response($response)).throw;

[14:28] <Xliff> That is the line rakudo is referencing.

[14:28] <lizmat> m: X::HTTP::Response.new(:rc('Max redirects exceeded'), :response($response)).throw;

[14:29] <Xliff> That's defined by HTTP::UserAgent

[14:29] <Xliff> Somewhere.

[14:29] <lizmat> that would imply the .throw didn't throw ?

[14:29] <Xliff> And this code was working, yesterday. 

[14:29] <Xliff> And I am wondering if it could be something in $response that is causing the problem, because that is something that I could fix.

[14:30] <Xliff> Would throw not throw if there was an exception in the catch for X::HTTP::Respnose.new?

[14:30] <lizmat> not sure

[14:32] <Xliff> Odd.

[14:32] <Xliff> It doesn't look like X::HTTP::Request has a $!response.

[14:32] <Xliff> Might that do it?

[14:32] <Xliff> Lemmesee

[14:33] <Xliff> Nope. Same error.

[14:33] <donaldh> it has code

[21:14] <AlexDaniel> tyil: unfortunately, no. I created this issue though: https://github.com/JRaspass/code-golf/issues/6

[21:15] <AlexDaniel> personally I'm not sure if it's better this way or not

[21:15] <tyil> it would be cool to be able to see the results of others after you submitted your result

[21:16] <tyil> and that you arent eligible for a better result once you've seen the results of others

[22:36] <Herby__> o/

[22:36] <timotimo> Juerd: interesting. i would have expected it to automatically box an Int, which does ~~ Numeric

[22:37] <Juerd> A value that's int, does

[22:37] <Juerd> int itself doesn't

[22:37] <Juerd> Thanks for the insight though. I hadn't looked into that yet.
