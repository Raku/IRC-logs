[03:02] <u-ou> Not sure if this is a bug or not, but when I try this script I get broken and glued together lines in my IO::Socket::Async's Supply. Docs say "Control characters (such as \n) always serve as grapheme boundaries, so any text-based protocols that use newlines or null bytes as terminators will not need special consideration." script here: https://pastebin.com/NHbLfqhQ

[03:03] *** jeek left
[03:04] *** astj left
[03:07] <geekosaur> u-ou, were you expecting lines to transit the network as lines?

[03:07] *** miatomi left
[03:08] <u-ou> I'm not sure what it's supposed to do but that line from docs sounds as though it's meant to

[03:08] <geekosaur> the network does not know of anything but octets. if you are not using UDP, routers and kernels will arbitrarily segment and reassemble packets; there is no guarantee the receiver will see anything but the same *stream*

[03:08] <geekosaur> how that stream is reported to you will vary

[03:08] <u-ou> ok

[03:08] *** astj joined
[03:08] <u-ou> so I have to take care of it myself

[03:09] <geekosaur> grapheme boundaries are not related to anything but how it looks for combining characters in a grapheme

[03:09] <geekosaur> yes

[03:09] <u-ou> ok

[03:09] <geekosaur> this is true of any network protocol. yours mayhappen to be line based, but this is not a universal

[03:09] <u-ou> ohhhh

[03:11] <geekosaur> presumably someone could do a layer that reassembled lines and passed them on as such (just make sure that's always what you need; some protocols have text-like commands but the data following them might be length delimited binary)

[03:12] <u-ou> yeah, I'm just wondering what is the right way to do it

[03:13] <geekosaur> I want to say another Supply which your receiver feeds reassembled lines

[03:14] <u-ou> *nod*

[07:01] <moritz> Perl 6 is newly designed from scratch, but inspired by Perl 5

[07:02] <moritz> so it's quite different. You can't throw Perl 5 scrits at a Perl 6 compiler and expect them to run

[07:02] <samcv> it is not back compatible

[07:02] <samcv> but it is so much fun :)

[07:03] *** bitrauser joined
[07:03] <TEttinger> there's inline stuff also

[07:03] <moritz> right, you can load the perl 5 interpreter in Rakudo, thus using Perl 5 code in Perl 6 (or vice versa)

[07:16] <tane> howdy

[07:16] <tane> is there anyway to return a pair of array from a sub routine? i.e. my (@a, @b) = some-sub; ?

[07:22] <masak> morning, #perl6

[07:23] <masak> m: my (@a, @b) := sub { return [1, 2], [3, 4] }(); say @a; say @b

[07:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 099512: OUTPUT: ¬´[1 2]‚ê§[3 4]‚ê§¬ª

[07:23] <masak> that latter one is grammatically correct -- and I don't have to name the sub -- but it kind of goes against my "visual pill" instincts

[11:37] <nadim> Moning #perl6,  can someone tell me if "also" is something more than   allowing inheritence (class, role) to be defined in the body of a class rather than the class header?

[11:37] <timotimo> nothing else to my knowledge

[11:38] <moritz> same here; except maybe it allows some weird stuff that would otherwise be hard

[11:38] <timotimo> stuff that derives from itself? :P

[11:38] <moritz> m: class A { class B { }; also is B }

[11:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 099512: ( no output )

[11:38] <moritz> m: class A { class B { }; also is B }; say A ~~ A::B

[11:38] <timotimo> neat, you can make that private and it'll be super strange and useless but cool!

[11:39] <nadim> "super strange and useless but cool", weirdly, I like that

[11:43] <moritz> any output above that?

[11:43] <leont> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/557779

[11:44] <timotimo> leont: heads up, i'm hoping i can add some better error messages to YAMLish; got any hints for me? like what kinds of code changes you'd like or not like to see?

[11:44] <timotimo> leont: that error is mea culpa. i rm'd the libtommath folder and reincarnated it as a git submodule and you have to rm -rf it manually to make stuff work again :)

[11:45] <moritz> right, if you rm -rf /home/leont/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/nqp/MoarVM you should be fine

[11:45] <leont> YAMLish needs a major refactor first. It really needs an AST

[11:45] <timotimo> leont: i don't have that much time :D

[11:45] <leont> I had this hunch a rm -rf would be involved in fixing this :-p

[11:45] <timotimo> also: holy crap, a whole lot of stuff you'd intuitively think would be invalid ... is actually valid and not quite what you'd expect

[11:45] <moritz> yes, YAML is "fun" like that

[11:46] <leont> Yeah, I've learned a lot of things about YAML that I didn't want to know.

[11:46] <timotimo> i can definitely put in an error when a map has a mis-indented key

[11:46] <timotimo> but not when a sequence does

[11:46] <timotimo> however, when a sequence has a mis-indented key, YAMLish rejects that outright as a parse fail, which it shouldn't

[11:46] <timotimo> so that's also something i'd like to "fix"

[11:47] <leont> My favorite exampe is putting a block scoped thingie inside an flowing thingie

[11:47] <timotimo> no, i don't want to see that. ever.

[11:48] *** raschipi joined
[11:49] <timotimo> are you looking to implement something like YAMLReference? like, a streaming parser for tokens/"events" and an interpreter for that to create the objects or proper errors from it?

[11:51] *** bjz joined
[11:51] <leont> I don't thing it has to be streaming

[11:51] <leont> YAML documents are rarely large enough to benefit from that

[11:51] <timotimo> fair enough

[11:51] <timotimo> the difference is just whether the list is consumed right away, or stored until the document has ended

[11:52] *** profan_ is now known as profan

[11:52] <timotimo> though also, it'll potentially change what errors you'll get

[11:53] *** robertle joined
[11:53] <timotimo> you won't get errors from the consumer rejecting the token stream, unless the producer reached the end without complaining

[11:53] *** AlexDaniel joined
[11:53] <timotimo> but i'm not sure if there are cases like that

[11:54] <leont> I don't think of it as a token stream, mainly because Grammars are recursive-decent

[11:54] <timotimo> that's fair, i guess

[11:55] <leont> Even if all other YAML parsers do work that way

[11:55] <timotimo> i didn't dive down far enough to get a clear understanding of the whole, rather than just individual pieces

[12:00] <leont> I have a moar--j=2/ folder, that looks like a mistake to me

[12:16] <leont> Editing it on both ends is problematic and not keeping them in sync is problematic.

[12:16] <leont> *is even more

[12:17] <timotimo> you mean how tap::harness fails with many test suites of perl6 modules?

[12:17] <timotimo> or have i missed something additional?

[12:17] <leont> I've just synced them

[12:17] <timotimo> i think i've missed something; sync tap::harness and what?

[12:18] <leont> It's in rakudo, and it's in separate repository, but it's the same code

[12:18] <timotimo> oh, i didn't realize

[12:20] *** perlawhirl joined
[12:21] <leont> Possibly the easy solution is to not have it in the ecosystem, given that it has been in rakudo for a year now. Not sure how far zefs backward compatibility goes.

[13:35] <timotimo> right, can't make templates work unless they are already instantiated in the way you want them to

[13:44] <moritz> which is a real PITA even when using C++ libraries in C++

[13:45] <moritz> it means you always have to keep the full source code o fthe libraries around

[13:47] <lizmat> which, atm, is not unlike Perl 5 or Perl 6 for that matter  :-)

[13:47] <lizmat> for Perl 6 we will be able to do better in the future  :-)

[13:54] <timotimo> not the full source code, just the header files!

[13:54] <timotimo> except of course that people write their whole projects in header files instead of source files!

[14:11] <moritz> well, if you write only headers into the header files, and give somebody an object file and the headers, they can't instantiate templates with unknown combinations of parameters

[14:11] * moritz guesses he missed the irony in timotimo++'s statement :-)

[19:20] <masak> Ubuntu is droppoing Unity? hadn't heard, but that sounds like good news from where I'm sitting.

[19:20] <masak> dropping*

[19:21] *** ChoHag joined
[19:21] <El_Che> masak: I suffered through the first buggy releases and I end up liking it :)

[19:21] <El_Che> just installed gnome on this laptop

[19:21] <El_Che> :)

[19:23] <El_Che> https://t.co/3Lu0WHO8k5

[19:23] <El_Che> The announcement

[19:25] <raschipi> All because of language bindings.

[19:26] <El_Che> gtk3?

[19:27] <raschipi> Qt bindings are few an far between and they suck everywhere but on C++ or Python.

[19:27] <El_Che> ah, unity 8

[19:37] <leont> Gnome Shell's awesome side is its extensibility, if they would want to they easily could

[19:38] <El_Che> I switched this "irc + firefox" machine first (and 2gb 9y old ultrabook)

[19:39] <El_Che> and gnome3 does not feel slow

[19:39] <El_Che> that's a win

[19:42] <raschipi> Amazon integration comes disbled by default for a long time. And it wouldn't be hard to write an amazon search provider for GNOME.

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> thinking about it, Canonical has done a lot to make sure I would never recommend Ubuntu to anyone

[19:46] <AlexDaniel> ‚Ä¶ only to revert it all back

[19:47] <leont> I loved Ubuntu when it was an up-to-date Debian, but got annoyed by the QA and now I'm on Arch

[19:48] <samcv> i use arch too

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> debian unstable works fine too :P

[19:49] <raschipi> It sure does.

[19:49] <samcv> i have debian unstable on my server

[19:50] <samcv> arch on desktop/laptops

[19:50] <AlexDaniel> :O

[19:50] <AlexDaniel> well, wouldn't really do that on a server‚Ä¶ :)

[19:50] <samcv> well. unstable is not unstable, it's just. the version numbers change

[19:50] <samcv> stable refers to the versions not changing

[19:50] <samcv> which i am totally fine with

[19:51] <samcv> though it also refers to the other kind of stability too, but. i want the latest versions

[19:52] <raschipi> I don't put unstable on servers because I like to activate automatic security upgrades.

[19:52] <raschipi> And unstable doesn't have those.

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> well, you can upgrade it automatically anyway

[19:55] <AlexDaniel> and then check your server every day to see if it is actually running‚Ä¶

[19:55] <raschipi> My clients would kill me...

[19:55] <samcv> i guess that's fair enough raschipi 

[19:58] <raschipi> It's good to avoid new features unless you can sell them.

[20:16] <raschipi> I think they already have the newest version in AUR

[20:16] <El_Che> ah nice

[20:17] <El_Che> (then no use case there)

[20:17] <MasterDuke> yeah, they're usually updated only a couple days after a release

[20:17] <El_Che> impressive

[20:17] <El_Che> I'll try to add alpine soon

[20:19] <raschipi> Debian also updates within a few days when they're not frozen.

[20:21] <El_Che> was glad when ubuntu came out: frozen recent packages
