[02:49] <dorothyw> I had thought there were macros in perl6 but they were called slangs

[02:49] <dorothyw> because apparently a macro is a very specific sort of way to add syntax.

[02:55] *** mcmillhj left

[03:07] *** mcmillhj left
[03:09] <dorothyw> based on this it seems macros do exist in perl6 https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/day-23-macros/

[03:12] *** mcmillhj joined
[03:13] <lookatme> yeah, IDK is slang is a kind if macro

[03:13] <lookatme> s/if/of/

[03:15] *** nadim left
[03:16] <dorothyw> AFAIK actual macros are supported

[03:17] *** Cabanossi left
[03:17] *** mcmillhj left
[03:17] <dorothyw> You just have to treat perl6 macros very gingerly by the sound of it

[03:17] <mst> I believe that while there is a macro facility in core it's not an officially-for-use thing because it's not a finalised design

[03:18] <lookatme> dorothyw, Perl 6 of course has macro, I found that in test suite

[03:18] *** Cabanossi joined
[03:19] <mst> slangs OTOH are a way to sort of lexically subclass the parser

[03:19] <lookatme> but there has no document about macro

[03:19] <mst> generally internal-use-only features don't get documented, no

[03:19] <lookatme> and I have read some slang example, there are not similar with macro for me

[03:28] <lookatme> you mean the sigilless variable ?

[03:28] <lookatme> https://docs.perl6.org/language/variables#Sigilless_variables

[03:31] <ipatrol> lookatme: is that how `lines` is created?

[03:32] <ipatrol> see https://github.com/dnmfarrell/Perl6-One-Liners#tutorial for an example

[03:33] *** mcmillhj joined
[03:33] <lookatme> ipatrol, it is not create container as document said, the different with sigil variable is it not enforce context

[03:33] <ipatrol> lookatme: but what is `lines` then?

[03:34] <lookatme> ipatrol, no

[03:34] <lookatme> there is just a sub

[03:34] *** skids left
[03:34] <lookatme> It's no a variable

[10:14] <eythian> is there a canonical place to go to read about perl6 keywords? e.g. I want to know about react and whenever, but when I google them I get the page on concurrency which does talk about them, but doesn't give me a perldoc-type explanation of everything about them.

[10:16] <jast> I think that is currently the primary location that documents react blocks

[10:18] <eythian> ah OK. I was hoping for something like 'perldoc -f foo' gives. But perhaps it's just not existant yet :)

[10:19] <stmuk> there is p6doc -f react but it may not even return that page

[10:20] <jast> the documentation for classes/objects is more structured

[10:20] <eythian> my computer doesn't seem to know anything about p6doc, alas

[13:31] <HoboWithAShotgun> good localtime() you wonderful people.

[13:31] <timotimo> o/

[13:31] <HoboWithAShotgun> Do you guys use any tools to enter the unicode operators of perl6?

[13:32] <timotimo> well, i have been typing neo2 for a long time and that has a whole lot of useful things easily accessible

[13:32] <timotimo> we do have a documentation page on unicode input that goes into a few different editors and operating system's input methods

[13:32] <timotimo> https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry

[13:33] <mspo> HoboWithAShotgun: it's tough

[13:33] <mspo> maybe a touchbar mac would be good :)

[13:33] <mspo> I was also thinking a phone/tablet app with a supplemental keyboard might be cool

[13:34] <HoboWithAShotgun> Not exactly flow friendly

[13:35] <mspo> that's probably why you'd use the texas symbols most of the time

[13:35] <mspo> and just let your editor transform them if you wanted

[13:35] *** epony joined
[13:35] <HoboWithAShotgun> maybe some kind of auto-correct?

[13:35] <mspo> sure

[13:35] <timotimo> i don't think there's anything you can't use an ascii equivalent for

[13:36] <mspo> in vim I think it would be easy-ish to setup

[13:36] <mspo> I think those set symbols are difficult to distinguish anyway :)

[13:36] <HoboWithAShotgun> so when you type <<< it turns it into «

[13:36] <mspo> although I can definitely see the appeal of them

[13:36] <timotimo> i remember a plugin that displays things pretty while keeping the "original" ascii underneith

[13:36] <mspo> HoboWithAShotgun: yeah you could do that

[13:37] <mspo> timotimo: that's another thing but now I forgot the name :)

[13:37] <timotimo> they call it "conceal"

[13:37] *** skids joined
[13:37] <AlexDaniel> HoboWithAShotgun: there's this page: https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry

[13:38] <HoboWithAShotgun> maybe i can hack an auto-hotkey script together. but that wouldn't help the majority of you guys 

[13:38] <AlexDaniel> ah, already mentioned

[13:38] * AlexDaniel is blind, sorry

[13:38] <HoboWithAShotgun> i know. i dont uuse vim or emacs and (i know, i know) windows

[13:38] <raschipi> timotimo: That would be supported in the font, it's called ligatures.

[13:38] <mspo> I think I'm thinking about ligatures

[13:38] <mspo> yeah

[13:38] <timotimo> raschipi: that's a different thing

[13:38] <timotimo> syn match HateWord /hate/ conceal cchar=!

[13:39] <timotimo> this would replace "hate" with a ! until you cursor into it

[13:39] <mspo> HoboWithAShotgun: both of those work on windows :)

[13:40] <timotimo> raschipi: though of course you can have a font with a ligature "math.pi" that looks like π

[13:40] <mspo> in the perl6 world you could replace the *actual* characters though, not just the display

[13:40] <timotimo> well, yeah

[13:40] <eythian> can't you just press compose-<< to get «?

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> yes

[13:40] <eythian> turns out you can

[13:40] <timotimo> but this is about when you can't easily input unicode characters

[13:41] * mspo looks for the compose button

[13:41] <timotimo> ≤_≥

[13:41] <eythian> I have it set to be the menu button, because I never use that

[13:41] * AlexDaniel has it on TAB, heh… :P

[13:41] <raschipi> I have it set to the right super button because there's two of those.

[13:42] <mspo> ⊎ vs ⊍  are just too similar for me

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> HoboWithAShotgun: I've come to a (possibly wrong) conclusion that getting your tools to enter unicode freely is a personal journey, so there's no easy answer

[13:42] <Altreus> caps lock seemed like a good candidate to me

[13:43] <timotimo> for me it's capslock + tab

[13:43] <Altreus> At once? :o

[13:43] <timotimo> at the same time, yes

[13:43] <timotimo> capslock is already what gives me stuff like \/{}*?()-:@

[13:43] <timotimo> and …_[]^!><=&ſ and #$|~`+%"';

[13:44] <timotimo> and ¹²³›‹¢¥‚‘’

[13:44] <AlexDaniel> there are three keys that you probably want to be placed in a better position: compose, hyper and altgr. But there is only one caps lock :(

[13:44] <mspo> I don't know how to type those bracket-looking quotes

[13:44] *** cpage_ left
[13:44] <mspo> ｢these｣

[13:44] <jast> I've repurposed altgr to enter umlauts and other assorted characters while using the US layout

[13:45] <Altreus> My keyboard already has keys for every ASCII character in that set :\

[13:45] *** cpage_ joined
[13:45] <Altreus> do you have a special tiny keyboard

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> jast: \o/ yay for custom layouts! If you have altgr placed in a comfortable position, consider adding altgr-ed arrow keys on the home row :)

[13:47] <timotimo> aye, altgr and esdf on neo2 are arrow keys

[13:47] <jast> I don't use arrow keys enough for that

[13:47] <timotimo> and there's pgup/pgdwn, home/end, escape, tab, backspace, delete around it

[13:47] <AlexDaniel> .oO(and also changing your spacebar to altgr. Just don't tell anybody that I recommended this)

[13:48] <jast> and I don't mind moving my hands sometimes, helps avoid muscle issues due to prolonged immobilization

[13:49] <mspo> I want an interrobang key

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> jast: that's ok :) One thing to note, however, is that your layout defines your workflow. If your arrow keys are too far, then you don't use them often.

[13:51] <timotimo> the fridge is far away from my desk and i still use it too often :<

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: consider changing it so that you have to hold a modifier to use it

[13:52] * eythian plans to install foot pedals

[13:53] <AlexDaniel> eythian: I've tried that, didn't work too well :( turns out that I'm moving around too often

[13:54] <eythian> Maybe a microphone then. So "AAAAAAAARGH"-<< gives you «

[13:54] <timotimo> fantastic

[13:54] <timotimo> vocal modifiers

[13:54] <eythian> it's the future, especially for open-plan offices.

[13:55] <jast> AlexDaniel: to be honest I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with distance of keys. I wouldn't want my letters and symbols spread all over the place, but going from typing to movements is a mental mode switch anyway. the speed at which I can move my hands has never felt like a limiting factor.

[13:56] <AlexDaniel> jast: it's no longer a mental mode switch for me. Movement, typing and editing is blended together for me

[13:56] <jast> in fact, I find that moving the hands and doing that mental mode switch correlates nicely on a cognitive and so I almost prefer moving my hands :)

[13:56] *** lizmat left
[13:56] <jast> maybe you're just way faster than me

[13:57] <AlexDaniel> no, that's because my layout has all these keys in the same place :)

[14:31] <hythm> Hello Perl6, For some reason I don't understand how to organize the code as modules... I read the docs multiple times (checked perl6 modules in github) but still don't get it, for instance where to use unit package, unit module, unit class,  subs inside these modules.

[14:32] <hythm>  I probably will get a better idea if I looked into an aplication example, where there is bin/app.p6 includes App.pm main module, and App.pm includes other major and small features of the app

[19:47] <ckraniak> Ok, native call on FormatMessage

[19:49] * stmuk finds an odd looking object which appears to be a Uk->Swiss plug adaptor

[19:49] <stmuk> useful!

[19:50] <ckraniak> "Native call expected return type with CPointer representation, but got a P6opaque (Int)"

[19:50] <timotimo> yeah, you passed an int where you were supposed to pass a pointer

[19:51] <geekosaur> I don't think you can use Int with NativeCall because it's a boxed, arbitrary-sized value

[19:51] <ckraniak> The call has uint32 (DWORD) in it

[19:51] *** hankache left
[19:51] <timotimo> oh god not windows api

[19:52] <geekosaur> m: my uint32 $x = 0

[19:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5fcce6: ( no output )

[19:52] <geekosaur> but that is not Int

[19:52] <timotimo> why does it say "return value" though?

[19:53] <ckraniak> That is once I call it

[19:53] <ckraniak> I assume it's because I am not setting up the return buffer right but I cannot find any example code that returns that way

[19:54] *** markmont left
[19:55] <timotimo> what's your definition look like? in perl6 code i mean

[20:00] <thunderheart> hi all, am doing my first steps into Perl6. Can you explain me the help syntax from docs.perl6.org, ie multi sub infix:<lcm>($a, $b --> Int:D) ?

[20:01] <ckraniak> sub __FormatMessage(uint32 $flags, Pointer[void] $source, uint32 $message-id, uint32 $language-id, Str $buffer is rw, uint32 $size, OpaquePointer $arguments --> uint32) is native('kernel32') is symbol('FormatMessageW') { ... }

[20:01] <ckraniak> But

[20:01] *** mack[m] left
[20:01] *** ilmari[m] left
[20:01] *** unclechu left
[20:01] <ckraniak> I have been messing with the signature to try to extract a different error message

[20:01] *** wictory[m] left
[20:02] <ckraniak> So the pointers and Str are just whatever right now

[20:03] <ckraniak> Been messing with types for $buffer and $argument mostly

[20:03] *** cdg joined
[20:03] <ckraniak> I am pretty sure OpaquePointer is wrong

[20:03] *** mienaikage joined
[20:04] *** cdg_ joined
[20:05] <timotimo> oh, this is about variable number of arguments?

[20:06] <ckraniak> Maybe?

[20:06] <ckraniak> Is this a known issue?

[20:06] <timotimo> yeah, we don't have proper support for var args yet, but you can declare multiple multi candidates that have any number of arguments ...

[20:07] *** thunderheart left
[20:07] <ckraniak> Tried leaving it off and that gives the same message

[20:07] <ckraniak> Documentation indicates a uint32 is rw will be accepted there

[20:08] *** cdg left
[20:09] <ckraniak> I don't understand the current error message and can't make it do any others

[20:12] <ckraniak> Or a Pointer[Pointer[uint32]]
