[00:02] <lucs> How does 'has $foo' (simple sigil) compare to 'has $.foo' or 'has $!foo'?

[00:03] <timotimo> it means one of the two

[00:03] *** noganex_ left
[00:03] <timotimo> m: class A { has $a; method foo { say $a } }; A.new.foo

[00:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84502d: OUTPUT: ¬´(Any)‚ê§¬ª

[00:04] <timotimo> m: class A { has $a; method foo { say $a } }; A.new.a

[00:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84502d: OUTPUT: ¬´No such method 'a' for invocant of type 'A'‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[00:04] <timotimo> looks like it's the same as $!a

[00:05] * lucs looks back at the code where he accidentally did the 'has $foo'...

[00:05] <timotimo> i'd recommend perl6critic to mark that up

[00:06] <timotimo> not that we actually have that just yet

[06:15] *** domidumont left
[06:16] <ugexe> can you post both of those files in the same gist (you can post multiple files in a single gist) as well as an additional file that shows the output with Grammar::Tracer ?

[06:22] <ugexe> you probably need to account for newline

[06:22] *** mcmillhj left
[06:22] <ugexe> maybe token TOP { ^^ .. $$ }

[06:25] <mrdside> <ugexe> why <descr> mathes only to "... -d3d"?

[06:25] <ugexe> huh

[06:25] <mrdside> <ugexe> whith your TOP the same has result

[06:26] <mrdside> not the same, but nothing

[06:28] *** domidumont left
[06:28] <ugexe> in any case you need to account for newlines or something

[06:29] <mrdside> ok, https://gist.github.com/mrDSide/0af89805d88471b85f750365bca9c227

[15:06] <tbrowder> hi #perl6

[15:07] <tbrowder> i've been away for a while but see reports of lots happening in the ecosystem

[15:08] <tbrowder> are we almost ready to move away from the current procedures?

[15:11] <timotimo> you mean away from modules.perl6.org and onto cpan?

[15:14] *** domidumont left
[15:14] <tbrowder> yes

[15:17] <tbrowder> i have several modules in work and am working on some tools to ease integration with the current ecosystem. i don't want to keep working in that direction if we're about to see a major change in procedures.

[15:24] <jdv79> the plan, for a year or two now, has been to move off github and onto cpan

[15:24] <curt_> https://github.com/ugexe/zef#cpan

[15:24] <jdv79> curious how far along we are myself

[15:27] <pmurias> didn't the recent Toolchain Summit make a lot of progress towards moving to cpan?

[15:32] <ugexe> yes you can upload distributions to cpan through PAUSE (or using App::Mi6 + CPAN::Uploader::Tiny), and you can enable searching cpan with --cpan

[15:32] <ugexe> enable searching cpan with zef --cpan^

[15:34] <ugexe> tbrowder: so something you might consider is then keeping your versioned distributions on cpan, but using github master + ecosystem to provide the absolute latest code

[15:37] <ugexe> last I knew Inline::Perl5, Acme::Meow, and Text::CSV were the only author uploaded modules on cpan as of yet

[15:37] *** marcovorg joined
[15:37] <ugexe> https://gist.github.com/ugexe/0e77eaba67c893e5a18042a59f20c164

[15:39] <ugexe> tbrowder: but anyway - you can have your modules on both cpan and the perl6 ecosystem if you want

[15:40] *** margeas left
[15:41] <jdv79> so, uploading to cpan has been working for over a year

[15:41] <ugexe> once a fair number of authors (some number more than 3 anyway) have uploaded their own perl6 dists to cpan then it will be enabled by default in zef

[15:41] <ugexe> jdv79: yeah but now you don't have to do the Perl6 folder thing

[15:41] <jdv79> oh?

[15:42] <ugexe> a META6.json can mark a distribution as perl6 in pause now

[15:43] <ugexe> which then does the Perl6/ folder thing for you when you upload

[15:43] <jdv79> oh neat

[15:44] <tbrowder> so how should we mod the META6.json file for the dual life?

[15:45] <ugexe> tbrowder: if you upload your distribution to cpan the source-url will be added for you automatically by my indexer

[15:45] <ugexe> it won't edit the actual file cpan has, but it does in the big ol json index of cpan that zef searches

[15:45] *** wamba joined
[15:46] <ugexe> additionally nine has a PR to pause that will do this *for the source-url in the distribution itself*

[15:49] <perlpilot> ugexe: did anyone at the summit discuss mods to metacpan.org for showing Perl¬†6 modules?

[15:50] *** bjz_ left
[15:50] *** wamba left
[15:50] <perlpilot> (I'm mostly just curious how people who would use CPAN can find Perl¬†6 modules in the same way they would Perl 5 modules)

[15:50] <jdv79> so wouldn't it be nicer to just kick the upload if a source-url is not correct or if anything about the dist is incorrect?

[15:51] <jdv79> i did the out of date metacpan mods.  is someone working on another set?

[15:52] <jdv79> if not i have part of the work to get them up to date i could do

[15:52] *** bjz joined
[15:53] <jdv79> the old idea was there will be 2 seperate metacpan instances.  i'm not sure if that is the current thinking after the summit.

[15:53] *** mcmillhj joined
[15:53] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[15:54] <ugexe> we didn't get a chance to discuss metacpan with anyone, although I did get to point people to jdvs working fork and show that there is a working implementation (that zef can also use fwiw)

[15:54] *** cpage_ left

[15:55] <jdv79> nice

[15:55] <ugexe> jdv79: the source-url should be set by pause/cpan because you might not know what the source-url is until you upload

[15:55] <jdv79> is the mi6 thing redundant to zef?

[15:55] <ugexe> (technically you could know because it follows a pattern, but still)

[15:55] <ugexe> App::Mi6 is an authoring tool

[15:56] <jdv79> isn't source-url field moot since to get the meta6.json file you had to fetch teh dist or somwhere very close to it in url

[15:57] <jdv79> i thought that field was originally a panda thing to point to gh from the eco

[15:57] <raschipi> I suggest the name "yondercpan" for the P6 tool.

[15:57] <ugexe> for instance: metacpan uses download-url

[15:57] <perlpilot> I thought the META6.json file was in the tarball they uploaded to PAUSE.

[15:57] <jdv79> also, if and when we do signed dists that's not gonnna fly

[15:58] <ugexe> source-url and where the meta6.json is found do not have to be related

[15:58] *** zakharyas joined
[15:58] <ugexe> all cpan json is currently at https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/blob/master/cpan.json

[15:58] <jdv79> the dist should probably just be validated and kicked

[15:58] <jdv79> ah, that's your file.  i had forgotten.

[15:58] *** Cabanossi left
[15:59] <ugexe> if you want to sign it then you would probably have to set the source-url yourself

[16:00] <raschipi> Pause should sign it.

[16:00] <ugexe> it could

[16:00] <raschipi> Like kernel.org does for linux.

[16:00] *** Cabanossi joined

[16:05] <jdv79> i guess.  modifying a dist on upload just seems dirty.

[16:08] *** wamba left
[16:08] *** CIAvash left
[16:09] <ugexe> jdv79: maybe the PR only changes the source-url in the .meta file that gets extracted alongside the .tar.gz

[16:09] <ugexe> nine ^ ?

[16:10] *** TimToady left
[16:11] <raschipi> What about Pause submitting a PR to the source-url provided so that if it's accepted it doesn't need to change it every time?

[16:12] *** TimToady joined
[16:17] *** BenGoldberg joined
[16:23] <ugexe> there is no reason a dist has to be git based

[16:23] <pmurias> what is supposed to be stored in the source-url?

[16:24] <raschipi> I know, but having it in case it is would be nice.

[16:24] <ugexe> source-url tells a module installer where to fetch a distribution from. so whatever "ecosystem" should be handling this

[16:25] <pmurias> what do we need source-url from?

[16:25] <ugexe> people have to manually set it for the ecosystem-api.p6c.org/projects.json ecosystem because it has no way of knowing itself (although it certainly could guess pretty easily)

[16:25] *** dakkar left
[16:25] <ugexe> if you are uploading to cpan you don't need to set the source-url

[16:26] <ugexe> for the p6c ecosystem you set it to whatever you want it to download (maybe its even a .tar.gz url to cpan)

[16:26] <araraloren> Any format uri which cam fetch module source code, right ?

[16:26] <ugexe> e.g. source-url is not part of META spec, its a recommendation manager / content storage  field

[16:27] <pmurias> so is there a need for it to be inside dists on CPAN or in module repos?

[16:27] <ugexe> araraloren: yes - it is expected that your package manager will understand the uri

[16:28] <tbrowder> ok, i will try out the mixed system with a new module soon.

[16:28] <ugexe> pmurias: it would be nice, but it doesn't have to be. it only needs to be in the *index* of meta data, not in the actual downloaded meta data extracted from the .tar.gz

[16:30] <araraloren> pmurias, No, actually even you can write plugin for zef to deal your uri format 

[16:32] <pmurias> ugexe: are module author aware what source-url is supposed to be or do they just cargo cult the github repo there

[18:16] <ugexe> well it depends, it'll take whichever is the highest version as stated in meta6.json - if its the same then it would take whichever it sees first (at the moment this is p6c ecosystem but only because its first in the config and doesn't search concurrently yet)

[19:19] <tbrowder>  so does zef still need --cpan to look there?

[19:22] <hahainternet> so the example i gave yesterday with 'token whatever { :i <@listoftokens> }' becomes a problem when you try and enable backtracking

[19:22] <hahainternet> i'm assuming that what's happening is that the token with a bunch of possibilities is always matching the first possible, so backtracking doesn't match alternatives

[19:23] <hahainternet> i assume the solution would be what i was considering yesterday, programmatically adding a bunch of tokens from the list rather than declaring a single token that's any list member

[19:23] <hahainternet> does this seem correct/dumb/reasonable/absurd etc?

[19:30] <nine> tbrowder: yes. FAIK it's ugexe's plan to make that the default this weekend.

[19:49] <Zoffix> Feels like the second option is more prefereable, I've just downloaded http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PS/PSIXDISTS/Perl6/Pastebin-Gist-0.000.001.tar.gz is it's pretty messy... Has 2 META file, both with authority "zoffixznet", but one lists original version 1.001001, but the other lists the faked out version 0.001001

[19:49] <Zoffix> 0.000.001 rather

[19:50] <Zoffix> And that's the only version is see listed in https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/blob/master/cpan.json

[19:50] <Zoffix> Meanwhile, the real latest version is 1.001003, with several bugs fixed: https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Pastebin-Gist/blob/master/META6.json#L5

[19:51] * Zoffix is a bit annoyed with PSIXDISTS 'cause that shit stays on backpan forever...

[19:52] <ugexe> zef --debug --cpan install Pastebin::Gist # installs version 1.001003 for me

[19:53] <ugexe> you have to do `zef --debug --cpan --/p6c --/cached install Pastebin::Gist` to get the crusty old version

[19:58] <ugexe> we have to stop making modules version *

[20:05] <Zoffix> In fact, PSIXDISTS breaks the license of all my modules in several points: it modified from orinal without specifying how it differs, and since modified version still bears the original name it interferes with installation of Standard Version were I to choose to use * as version

[20:06] <geekosaur> not this again. why do people think it;s just fine to accept any random version of an api (or module version that inevitably will express an API)?

[20:06] <geekosaur> this is one of those "you claim to accept any version? fine, my api launches nethack"

[20:19] <moritz> we shouldn't ban * as version until we make it really easy to create and publish releases of modules

[20:19] <moritz> with the current system of pushing stuff to github, you have to remember to change a version number for each commit, or you end up with multiple different versions with the same version number, which totally defeats the point of version numbers in the first place

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> wait, what is this? https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-perl6

[23:22] *** mcmillhj_ joined
[23:22] <AlexDaniel> I can't see it in the module directory

[23:23] <BenGoldberg> It's pure perl6, not a library binding, so it will be slow.

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> I see it, but that's ok

[23:23] <AlexDaniel> AH

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> it's called just ‚ÄúDigest‚Äù

[23:24] <AlexDaniel> ok

[23:24] * AlexDaniel is blind

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> awesome

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> .seen FROGGS

[23:27] <yoleaux> I saw FROGGS 17 Jan 2017 21:11Z in #perl6: <FROGGS> dataf3l: to this: http://hg.dyncall.org/pub/dyncall/dyncall/file/011b5e3a8548/dyncall/dyncall_callf.c#l91

[23:28] <AlexDaniel> .tell grondilu Some sha tests are failing when installing Digest, perhaps worth taking a look

[23:28] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to grondilu.
