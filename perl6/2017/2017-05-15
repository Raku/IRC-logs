[01:46] <SmokeMachine> Hi there! Is there any way to get a sub code?

[01:46] *** pierre joined
[01:47] <lookatme> sub code ?

[01:47] <lookatme> you mean source code ?

[01:48] *** ilbot3 joined
[01:48] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v ilbot3

[01:48] <SmokeMachine> Yes...

[01:48] <SmokeMachine> The source code of the sub

[01:49] <SmokeMachine> m: sub a {say 42}; say &a.perl

[01:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 95e49d: OUTPUT: «sub a () { #`(Sub|50406888) ... }␤»

[01:50] <SmokeMachine> I mean something like that, but not with the ... but the actual code...

[01:50] <MasterDuke_> SmokeMachine: there currently is no way for regular subs/methods/etc

[01:50] <MasterDuke_> you can get the source to tokens/rules/regexes though

[01:50] <lookatme> Why you tried get source code?

[01:50] <SmokeMachine> MasterDuke_: is there any plan to make it possible?

[01:51] <MasterDuke_> timotimo and jnthn were talking about this recently, i don't rememeber the conclusion though

[01:51] <SmokeMachine> lookatme: I'm trying to share functions between different computers...

[01:52] <lookatme> SmokeMachine, oh, why you make a service run function ?

[01:52] <MasterDuke_> SmokeMachine: i think nadim was talking with them about it (in the past 2-3 weeks), you could try searching the logs

[01:52] <lookatme> s/why/how/

[01:52] <SmokeMachine> MasterDuke_: thanks! I'll look for that on log!

[01:53] <lookatme> ...why not make a service run function

[01:53] <SmokeMachine> (I was away to long...)

[01:53] <SmokeMachine> lookatme: I'm trying that for 2 different projects...

[01:54] <lookatme> That's like a RPC service

[01:54] <SmokeMachine> lookatme: first to use as a remote promise lib

[01:55] <SmokeMachine> lookatme: and the second one is a datomic like database...

[01:57] <lookatme> I think it's not safe run code in your server

[01:58] <SmokeMachine> lookatme: what do you mean?

[02:00] <lookatme> I mean run any code send on server  it's not safe, 

[02:00] <lookatme> maybe some risky operator would be execute

[11:40] <araraloren> timotimo, thanks for your advice about that module

[11:40] <timotimo> i've made one in the past that allowed for some borders to be double and some to be single lined

[15:21] <perlpilot> bioexpress: Linux::Cpuinfo perhaps

[15:22] *** araraloren joined
[15:22] <haxmeister> but the perl module is a pure perl solution and requires no system call :)

[15:22] <robertle> not sure it is exposed, but there must be something within perl6, how would it set the size of the default thread pool otherwise?

[15:23] <timotimo> robertle: it evaluates "16" and uses the result of that

[15:23] <robertle> timotimo: wow, that is really clever!

[15:23] <timotimo> unless a RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS is set

[15:23] <timotimo> it's a highly technical and complicated process

[15:24] <robertle> yeah, and really good engineering: use heuristics first!

[15:24] <robertle> and it also does not require a system call!

[15:24] <timotimo> it might require a sbrk to get enough memory for the variable!

[15:24] <haxmeister> windows stores it in a env variable: echo %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%

[15:25] <haxmeister> can also system call msinfo and parse it out

[15:26] <robertle> timotimo: I have done that before in some app, would you be interested in a patch?

[15:33] <robertle> yes, a patch to set the number of pool threads to the number of logical cores. but I had a quick look and stumbled on the obvious: you would probably want to put some portable method into moar, and expose through nqp. so a bit more involved that I was initially thinking...

[15:34] <robertle> that is based on my assumption that all platform-specfic stuff should be in the VM?

[22:49] <timotimo> and that didn't work?

[22:54] <beginner> timotimo : it shows up error "Failed to update p6c mirror Enabled fectching backends [path] don't understand"

[22:55] <timotimo> i've seen this from someone else recently, but the installation still went through in that case
