[01:00] <lizmat> "$ = $ for $primes"  ??  am I missing something ?

[01:00] <lizmat> Zoffix: ^^^

[01:00] <Zoffix> lizmat: dunno. Why do you think you're missing something? The idea is nqp::null for $primes

[01:02] <lizmat> shouldn't that be "$_ = $_ for $primes" ?

[01:02] *** astronavt joined
[01:02] <Zoffix> lizmat: doesn't matter. The problematic bit is the `|$primes` iteration itself, not what the for loop does

[01:03] <Zoffix> I just don't know anything better than `$ = $` for a null operation that doesn't emit a warning

[01:03] <lizmat> then maybe "Nil for #primes" ?

[01:03] <lizmat> *$primes

[01:03] <Zoffix> m: Nil for <a b c>

[01:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: ( no output )

[01:03] <Zoffix> How come that doesn't warn?

[05:49] <geekosaur> it found the lexical max

[05:49] <geekosaur> not the numeric one

[05:50] <Herby_> doh

[05:50] <geekosaur> you use split, it produces Strs

[05:50] <Herby_> what would be the clean way to do that, given a string?

[05:50] <Herby_> simple for loop?

[05:50] <teatime> m: my $line = "86 440 233 83 393 420 228 491 159 13 110 135 97 238 92 396"; say $line.split(/\s/)».Int.max()

[05:51] <geekosaur> that yes

[05:51] <teatime> is one possibility

[07:16] *** Todd joined
[07:16] <Todd> HI all,  A dumb question (but that never stopped me!)

[07:16] <Todd> Why does this work: $cmd = "/usr/bin/atop 1 1 > $GoodATop 2>&1";    $str = qqx{ $cmd };

[07:17] <Todd> but including the string on the qqx lie does not.  Why do I need to use a variable?

[07:17] <Todd> symptom: /bin/sh: /usr/bin/atop 1 1 > /opt/Cimcor/CimTrak/CimTrakServer/logs/atop.txt: No such file or directory

[07:18] <Todd> $str = qqx{ "/usr/bin/atop 1 1 > $GoodATop 2>&1" };  doesn't work

[07:18] <teatime> that's not getting shell quoted

[07:18] <teatime> or rather, I think it is, but you put it in "" which get passed to the shell :)

[07:18] <Todd> Oh, so leave the quotes off?

[07:19] <teatime> try:  $str = qqx{ /usr/bin/atop 1 1 > $GoodATop 2>&1 };

[07:19] <teatime> yeah.  qqx{} is itself the quoting construct

[07:19] <Todd> Bugger.  Thank yoU!

[07:20] <Todd> worked perfectly  Thank yoU!

[07:20] <teatime> excellent.

[07:22] <Todd> This one worked too!

[07:22] <Todd> my $str = qqx{ cd /opt/Cimcor/CimTrak/CimTrakServer; ./CimTrakServer.exe -Diagnostics \"Level=255\" > $GoodCimDiagErr 2>&1 };

[07:22] *** wamba joined
[07:23] <Todd> Will wonder ever cease!

[07:23] <geekosaur> I think the backslashes are unnecessary there

[07:23] <teatime> do you even need to escape

[07:23] <teatime> yeah

[07:23] <geekosaur> in a "" string theyd be needed but here the quotes are { }

[07:23] <geekosaur> so they unescape to "

[07:24] <geekosaur> also I can't imagine $str contains much useful after that since you send it all to a file

[07:24] <Todd> ordinarily no, but the program required it for some reason.

[07:25] <Todd> It is ported from that "other" operating system, whose name I can not mention.

[07:25] <geekosaur> qqx  does because it's an expression. you probably wanted

[07:25] <teatime> Todd: VMS?

[07:25] <geekosaur> shell " cd /opt/Cimcor/CimTrak/CimTrakServer; ./CimTrakServer.exe -Diagnostics \"Level=255\" > $GoodCimDiagErr 2>&1 "

[07:26] <geekosaur> and here you do need the escapes

[07:26] <teatime> well only because you chose to use " "  ;)

[07:26] <geekosaur> also note that, as with perl 5's ``, using qqx when you don;t need the output is kinda expensive

[07:27] <geekosaur> yes, I could have used « » or something instead

[07:27] <geekosaur> also, uh, good luck running that on VMS :p

[07:28] <geekosaur> directories don't work the same way, redirection requires something that looks more like JCL than Unix

[07:28] * teatime looks at geekosaur.

[07:28] <geekosaur> (yes, I know. ironically that'd actually stand soem chance of working as is on modern windows)

[07:28] <teatime> oh, the command line

[07:29] <geekosaur> simple Bourne-shell-style redirections have worked in cmd.exe since windows nt 3.5 and win98 (win95 had a few more limitations but I think that one did work)

[07:30] <geekosaur> ok, modulo the slashes needing to be backslashes in cmd.exe

[07:30] <teatime> heh

[07:31] <Todd> This is Fedora 27.  I need the quotes and backslash when run from the (bash) command line too.  I was warned by the program's tech support.  It also has to run in its own directory too.  Weird, but ..

[07:32] <geekosaur> oh, one of those programs. bad win port

[07:32] <geekosaur> in that case I would actually be surprised that the qqx one worked because perl would strip the backslashes before it went to the shell

[07:33] <Todd> I asked this last time, but has anyone come up with a better perl 6 for win 32?  I really do not want to use Perl 5.

[07:33] <geekosaur> last I heard the win32 build reliably ran out of memory

[07:34] <geekosaur> while building

[07:34] <Todd> I got the above to work trial and error.  I had the 2>&1 redirect wrong and you guys helped me figure it out.

[07:34] <geekosaur> might be fixable but I don't think we have anyone working on perl 6 who has a win32 setup

[07:35] <geekosaur> (like, I have a windows vm always running but it's 64 bit)

[07:35] *** anant joined
[07:35] <Todd> that is what I heard.  Any way to build a win32 msi on a 64 bit system?

[07:35] <anant> Does perl6 support nested classes?

[07:35] <teatime> yes.

[07:35] <geekosaur> (and insufficient memory to run a second concurrently, and I use the main one often enough that shutting it down kinda messes things up)

[07:36] <geekosaur> it would have to be a cross-build and I don't think that's currently supported

[07:36] <Todd> bugger.

[07:36] <teatime> ... did I just lie

[07:36] <geekosaur> (windows has odd restrictions. best bet might be to try to get a wow32 build env; not sure how painful that is.)

[07:36] <geekosaur> nested classes should work fine

[07:37] <Todd> anyone know what the P5 equivalent of slurp and spurt is?

[07:37] <geekosaur> but accesses might be funny

[07:39] <Todd> When building Wine Staging, I have a "./configure --disable-win64" option.  Nothing like that for Perl6?

[07:39] <geekosaur> don't think there is a spurt. slurp is { my $o = select $fh; local $/ = undef; my $r = <$fh>; select $o; $r } assuming $fh is the filehandle (this can be simplified a bit in some circumstances)

[07:39] <anant> I didn't an example of a nested class in https://docs.perl6.org/language/objects

[07:39] <geekosaur> that tells wine to not build win64 emulation into it, not that it should build a win32 program

[07:39] <anant> I didn't = I didn't see

[07:39] <Todd> no sign of either over on https://perldoc.perl.org/index-functions.html#S

[07:39] <geekosaur> it'll generate a 64-bit executable that only handles win32 emulation

[07:40] <geekosaur> m: class A { has $.a; class B { has $.b }}; my $x = A::B.new(b => 6); say 'alive'

[07:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «alive␤»

[07:41] <geekosaur> so it may depend on what you mean by nested

[07:41] <geekosaur> since it's mostly namespacing not e.g. need an A to make an A::B

[07:45] <geekosaur> heh. back in the old days FileHandle.pm had a slurp but it looks like current IO::Handle lacks it

[07:45] *** aborazmeh left
[07:46] <geekosaur> I recall it being somewhat discouraged

[07:46] <geekosaur> although there were two camps on the issue

[07:46] <anant> Thanks geekosaur and teatime :)

[07:47] <teatime> geekosaur++

[07:47] <anant> teatime++

[07:51] <geekosaur> oh, if you wanted that nested class to only be accessible nside of class A, it's 'my class B { ... }'

[07:53] *** darutoko joined
[07:53] <anant> ok. Are nested classes discouraged in general?  I searched many perl6 tutorials, but didn't see them mentioned.

[07:53] <buggable> New CPAN upload: Inline-Go-0.0.4.tar.gz by AZAWAWI https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/A/AZ/AZAWAWI/Perl6/Inline-Go-0.0.4.tar.gz

[07:54] <geekosaur> not so much discouraged as of dubious use

[07:55] *** Todd left
[07:56] <anant> Hmm. Does Perl6 have a "Zen" guide like Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

[07:56] <geekosaur> nope.

[07:57] <anant> It would be nice to have :) 

[07:57] <anant> I liked how the Python Zen said: Flat is better than nested.

[07:57] <geekosaur> python is One Correct Way; perl is There Is More Than One Way To Do It

[07:57] <anant> ah!

[07:57] <anant> geekosaur++

[07:58] <geekosaur> which is why perl 6 mixes OO, FP, procedural, etc. and lets you mix and match according to need or convenience

[08:00] <geekosaur> I imagine some conventions will eventually be agreed on by the community, but p6 is young enough that there aren't many such yet

[08:03] <wander> still so many things TODO

[08:04] <anant> Hmm. 

[08:05] <wander> that is why i am somewhat anxious about our Advent Calendar Day1. feature `but` has several known bugs

[10:53] <bartolin> kupopo: yeah, unfortunately the jvm backend was badly broken when Rakudo Star 2017.10 was released. it should look a bit better (and actually be installable) on HEAD. there are major problems, still (e.g. 'make' does not work before 'make test', nativecall is broken). i added some details to your gist: https://gist.github.com/shicks/27df7cf0d868b61eea59b950942d4c62

[10:59] <hahainternet> .min and .max on an array of strings gives back nonsense results

[11:00] <hahainternet> ».Numeric solves it, but I wouldn't expect them to give back such weird outputs

[11:00] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: why so

[11:00] <hahainternet> the strings don't get coerced into the numbers they represent though, i am far too perl6 ignorant to discover why

[11:00] <AlexDaniel> m: say <abcdoeu sthiozeu uloeuhal>.max

[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «uloeuhal␤»

[11:00] <AlexDaniel> m: say <abcdoeu sthiozeu zzozzzt uloeuhal>.max

[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «zzozzzt␤»

[11:00] <AlexDaniel> m: say <abcdoeu sthiozeu zzozzzt uloeuhal>.min

[11:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «abcdoeu␤»

[11:00] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: i understand

[11:01] <hahainternet> but this kinda violates the whole cool interoperability of strings/numbers in perl doesn't it?

[11:01] <hahainternet> perl6*

[11:01] <AlexDaniel> I don't think so. You gave it a list of strings, and then asked for the max element

[11:02] <hahainternet> i actually gave it just a list, never specifying strings

[11:02] <hahainternet> (semantics i know, but from a programmer's perspective it's important)

[11:02] <geekosaur> you have it a list of things that don't look like numbers

[11:02] <hahainternet> they certainly do look like numbers

[11:02] <geekosaur> if they look like numbers then you get IntStr-s

[11:02] <geekosaur> if they don't then you get Str-s

[11:02] <AlexDaniel> what's the code we're talking about?

[11:02] <geekosaur> (this means you can actually get a mixture)

[11:03] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: it's just for AOC #2, for 'file'.IO.lines -> $l { my @n = $l.split(/\t/); }

[11:03] <hahainternet> presumably that produces some sort of hard String type

[11:04] <hahainternet> that won't coerce in a cool way

[11:04] <AlexDaniel> well, you took a string and split it, so you got strings back

[11:04] <geekosaur> ^

[11:04] <hahainternet> ok, how would i recover the cool behaviour?

[11:04] <geekosaur> we discussed thsi earlier, actually, split is a Str operation, it will always give you Strs

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: $l.split(/\t/)».Cool ? :)

[11:05] <geekosaur> $l.split(/\t/)>>.Int (or that)

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> that doesn't work :(

[11:05] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: doesn't appear to exist?

[11:05] <hahainternet> geekosaur: doing ».Numeric, so that's fine

[11:05] <AlexDaniel> .IntStr doesn't work too

[11:06] <hahainternet> anyhow not a major complaint, but it felt a bit wart-y

[11:06] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: any reason why we don't have Str.IntStr ?

[11:06] <geekosaur> too much magic has its own problems

[11:06] <geekosaur> "every DWIM has a WAT"

[11:06] <hahainternet> geekosaur: speak for your own wizardry ;)

[11:06] <geekosaur> you say that now...

[11:07] <hahainternet> no i know what you're saying

[11:07] <hahainternet> but it should be up to the programmer to opt in or out to the wizardry they want

[11:07] <hahainternet> and i got opt-outed by default :)

[11:07] <geekosaur> because it's easy to opt back in with the hyperop

[11:07] <hahainternet> geekosaur: right but it isn't, that only coerces, it doesn't restore the cool behaviour i mentioend

[11:07] <hahainternet> i mean my problem is solved, so ty

[11:07] <geekosaur> and you have more control, which matters quite a lot in many cases

[11:08] * geekosaur keeps being reminded of nancy typing

[11:08] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: but you can also think about performance. That is, should it actually look into every single element returned from .split, and check if it's a number or not?

[11:08] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: if it's an IntStr sure? :)

[11:08] <geekosaur> (which was p5's "cool" behavior gone wrong plus a NaN parsing issue)

[11:08] <hahainternet> i don't mean the existing case should be changed

[11:09] <hahainternet> i would just like ».Cool or ».IntStr as you gave as an example

[11:09] <AlexDaniel> hahainternet: not sure I understand, how would it know if it's an IntStr? :)

[11:10] <hahainternet> AlexDaniel: methods are dispatched on types? i'm not suggesting .split or anything do the coercion

[11:10] *** Aaronepower joined
[11:11] <geekosaur> you seem to think a type is determined solely by looking at it. do you really want everything that touches it to have to compute its current type first

[11:11] <hahainternet> geekosaur: where do i think that? I just would like a way to coerce them

[11:11] <hahainternet> 11:09.07 < hahainternet> i would just like ».Cool or ».IntStr as you gave as an example

[11:13] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: I don't see a reason not to have Str.IntStr

[11:15] <lizmat> but I would make it slightly more involved than just IntStr.new(self.Int,self), because with that, any error in converting to Int becomes multi-level, and thus complicated

[11:15] <lizmat> m: dd "foo".Int

[11:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «Failure.new(exception => X::Str::Numeric.new(source => "foo", pos => 0, reason => "base-10 number must begin with valid digits or '.'"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)␤»

[11:15] <lizmat> as Str.Int returns a Failure, that will explode when trying to bind

[11:15] <lizmat> so if self.Int returns a Failure, you should throw that immediately, I think

[11:16] <wander> m: my $x = IntStr.new(12, "42"); say $x + 4; say $x;

[11:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «16␤42␤»

[11:16] <wander> the evil way :)

[11:21] <AlexDaniel> m: my $x = IntStr.new(12, "I'm not a Str, get off my lawn!"); say $x + 4; say $x;

[11:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «16␤I'm not a Str, get off my lawn!␤»

[11:28] <lizmat> not too dissimilar from dualvar() in P5  :-)

[11:29] <lizmat> handy for things like errno(), where the Str version contains the error message

[11:34] <squashable6> 🍕 W4anD0eR96++ opened issue “MOP ^add_method could be renamed as ^add-method”: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1292

[11:36] <poohman> hello all, I have a question regarding grammar tokens - if the * is for zero or more, why does the following token work and not the next 

[11:36] <poohman> token frame {\s*<top_left>\r\n\s*<date_or_time>'</TD>'\r\n}

[11:36] <poohman> the above works

[11:36] <wander> mainly about consistency, not have to be kebab-case

[11:36] <poohman> token frame {\s*<top_left>\s*\r\n\s*<date_or_time>'</TD>'\r\n}

[11:37] <poohman> the only difference is the \s* before \r

[11:37] <geekosaur> because * is greedy and \r and \n both match \s, so you have \s*\s* which is kinda asking for problems

[11:37] <wander> what is the text?

[11:38] <geekosaur> or put otherwise, you've given that regex *way* too much rope

[11:38] <wander> m: say so "\r\n" ~~ /\s*/

[11:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[11:38] <wander> m: say so "\r\n" ~~ /\s*?\r\n/

[11:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5929887c7: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[11:39] *** espadrine left
[11:39] <wander> also note that it's 'token'

[11:40] <wander> so backtracking is disable

[11:40] <geekosaur> (I oversimplified that a bit; the reality is that it's got far too many ways to match --- and token is ratcheting, so once the first \s* commits to matching the \r\n, it can;t backtrack when it sees the literal ones

[11:40] <poohman> ok

[11:41] <geekosaur> so (a) since it can;t backtrack, it can't "unmatch" the \r and \n it committed to the first \s* and will fail when it hits them in the pattern (b) and if you make it non-ratcheting, it will be sloooooooooooooooow

[12:19] *** Aaronepower joined
[12:20] <pdcawley> jamesnvc: I'm not sure that Emacs has a concept of a <menu> key by default. However, you can pick something (say Key_Menu or whatever) and then use `key-translation-map` to map from whatever emacs thinks it is initially, to `(kbd "<menu>")`, and you should be able to bind to `(kbd "<menu>")` rather than the weird name.

[12:27] <AlexDaniel> pdcawley: that's great to know, but is it the right channel? :D

[12:27] <pdcawley> Arse!

[12:27] <pdcawley> And, it turns out, I'm wrong. Emacs _does_ know about the menu key.

[12:27] <AlexDaniel> pdcawley: yeah, it defaults to M-x I think

[12:30] *** ChoHag left
[12:32] <AlexDaniel> pdcawley: some keyboard *layouts* are weirder. I remapped my spacebar to AltGr :)

[12:33] <pdcawley> AlexDaniel: Don't talk to me about weird layouts. I've got a KeyboardIO model 01, 64 keys in an an approximation of the Malt layout ('E' on the left thumb, ANIS/THOR on the home row.

[12:34] <AlexDaniel> (or is it other way around? What I meant is that my spacebar is AltGr now)

[12:35] <AlexDaniel> pdcawley: oh, that one is cool. Have you seen X-Bows by the way? Another relatively similar keyboard, although it probably doesn't come with a crazy keyboard layout :)

[12:37] <pdcawley> Nope. But I do have an original Maltron that I've cut down to a 64 key matrix, rewired and rebrained to do NKRO and other such stuff, and a Kinesis that I keep meaning to hack palm keys into (and possibly rebrain, but it's got more sophisticated hardware than the Maltron, which was entirely hand wired to begin with.

[12:38] <AlexDaniel> maaaan… keyboardio should really come with perl 6 manual or something :D

[18:46] <TimToady> but (&say) is not a valid postfix, except insofar as it passes &say as an argument to something

[18:47] <TimToady> this is definitely somewhere in the "undefined behavior" realm

[18:47] <wander> yes, so you can see `[1,2,3]>>&say` throws "expecting any of:␤        postfix␤"

[18:48] <wander> however the form (&say) escapes for some reasons

[19:53] <jnthn> Note that if you omit the : before $num then it isn't one of the exposed names

[19:54] <jnthn> You can in fact do this any time you want to have one external name for a named parameter but put it into a variable of a different name

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1696

[19:56] <TreyHarris> oh, duh, I did try it, but I tried to name it "ordinated-2", which isn't a legal sub name. :-P

[19:57] <jnthn> That's another way to avoid an unexpected bonus name for it, yes :)

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> maybe it'd make sense to support something like :st:nd:rd:th($num)

[19:58] <ctilmes> Should :3st be an error?

[19:58] <TreyHarris> jnthn: "bonus name"? what's the "bonus name"?

[19:58] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: ordinated(:32num)

[19:59] <TreyHarris> ctilmes: no, specifically for the benefit of non-English-speakers, th/st/rd/nd are interchangeable

[19:59] <jnthn> TreyHarris: If you do sub foo(:nd(:st(:$num))) { } then you can pass it as :num($value) too

[19:59] <jnthn> TreyHarris: Make it just sub foo(:nd(:st($num))) { } and the $num name is purely for internal use

[20:01] <TreyHarris> ctilmes: I think that was specifically mentioned in Apocalypse <mumble> in 2002

[20:02] <TreyHarris> I know this because I can remember the desk I was sitting in when I read that and thought, "ah, makes sense"

[20:02] <AlexDaniel> aliases are not even documented I think. Maybe a little bit in https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#sub_MAIN

[20:03] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: re your issue, is that an faq, or for a useful example of aliasing in functions.pod6? I'll take the issue and write it up

[20:04] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: I'd say aliasing should be documented, and this can be one of the examples

[20:04] <TreyHarris> (Though as an FAQ it's an easy add, for functions we should add a bit about aliases.)

[20:04] <TreyHarris> AlexDaniel: agreed.

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> TreyHarris: also this https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#sub_MAIN should probably link to that newly written section

[20:20] <TreyHarris> I was nearly done with a package that I need to finish but need to update it first

[20:52] <Morfent> i think i might port net::dns to perl 6

[20:54] <TreyHarris> Morfent: it's only 5 years old, from the CPAN history? That really surprises me, I feel like I've known about it forever

[22:56] <Herby_> rookie question incoming...

[22:57] <Herby_> how should module naming conventions work? sometimes I see Net::FTP convention

[22:57] <Herby_> other times I just see FTP

[22:57] <Herby_> why one or the other?

[22:57] <Herby_> If I wanted to create a module for the oxford dictionary api, should I name it Oxford::Dictionary? or just Dictionary

[22:58] <Herby_> that seems to be something Python avoids, for one reason or another

[22:58] <ctilmes> Or Dictionary::Oxford so later someone else makes a similar API to Dictionary::Foo

[22:58] <Herby_> ah

[22:58] <Herby_> good point

[22:59] *** Cabanossi left
[23:00] <Herby_> one more dumb question: does the file structure matter with the naming convention used?

[23:01] *** donaldh left
[23:01] <Herby_> If I use Dictionary::Oxford, does my file structure need to be:  ./lib/dictionary/oxford.pm6

[23:01] <ctilmes> Perl5 makes a concerted effort to maintain organization of module hierarchies.  It kind of failed at that.  IMHO, it is much less important in Perl 6 world

[23:01] <Herby_> or should it be ./lib/oxford.pm6

[23:01] *** Cabanossi joined
[23:02] <ctilmes> Convention would be to match file tree to name scheme, but it actually doesn't have to.

[23:02] <Herby_> thats what I assumed but I never knew for sure.

[23:02] <Herby_> thanks

[23:04] *** dmaestro left
[23:07] <ctilmes> You have to put it somewhere it can be found in the manner you cause it to be searched for.

[23:07] <jnthn> If you want it to work with -I then you need to follow the directory structure

[23:08] <ctilmes> https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Finding_Modules

[23:08] <jnthn> If you don't care about that (though it'd make development a bit "fun" :P) then one doesn't *have* to follow the convention, however :)

[23:09] <Herby_> gotcha

[23:09] <Herby_> thanks for that link ctilmes 

[23:10] <jnthn> As ctilmes said, though, trying to build some neat hierarchy isn't something we worry about so much in the Perl 6 world. Searching and tags have won as ways of people fidning stuff.

[23:12] *** kitsunenokenja joined
[23:12] <Herby_> makes sense. as a beginner I just want to make sure I stick to any standard conventions if there are some

[23:28] <timotimo> so ... the official csv games use 100x more lines in their hello.csv than we do in our test-t

[23:28] <timotimo> but almost all of them are faster than rakudo is at the task

[23:29] * geekosaur was going to say "they're also probably 100x faster" :p

[23:29] <timotimo> yup.

[23:29] <geekosaur> we... have a ways to go

[23:30] <timotimo> the slowest seems to be ruby, which takes about 9.3 seconds

[23:30] <Herby_> and what is p6 at?

[23:31] <timotimo> takes just below 3 seconds now

[23:32] <timotimo> maybe we want to have a version based on libcsv, too :P

[23:32] <timotimo> the luajit version uses that adn clocks in at just below a second

[23:34] *** dmaestro joined
[23:36] *** mson left
[23:40] <timotimo> since the input file is 23 megs big, taking a second means you're doing 23 megs per second 

[23:40] <timotimo> at that point you might as well be bottlenecked by spinning rust and filesystem :P

[23:42] <timotimo> our csv library spends barely any time doing GC, that is good

[23:43] <timotimo> i'm refering to percentage-wise, though

[23:43] <timotimo> 14 seconds in total

[23:43] <timotimo> the gc runs 9950 times

[23:46] <timotimo> we're still spending 20.7% of total time doing splitting

[23:47] <timotimo> 3.46% of that is sorting the indices of different split-pieces found in the string (adds up to 13 secodns)

[23:47] <Herby_> This API requires headers in the get request.  app_id = 123, app_key = xyz .  How do I use those in an HTTP::UserAgent get request?

[23:47] <Herby_> I'm poking around the documentation but I can't quite figure it out

[23:50] *** yqt left
[23:51] <timotimo> it looks like headers get put as named arguments into the call

[23:51] <timotimo> i see an example with post rather than get that passes X-Foo => "foodle"

[23:52] <timotimo> so it's probably the same way for get

[23:52] *** kitsunenokenja left
[23:54] <Herby_> something like: my %response = $ua.get($url, {app_key => $app_key, app_id => $app_id}) ?

[23:55] <timotimo> no, without the braces

[23:56] <timotimo> i think what you pass as a hash there would be form data for post requests and such
