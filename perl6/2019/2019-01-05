[00:13] <zachk> how can do I something like : say "my dog's name is $d.name" ?

[00:16] <atweiden-air> zachk: class Dog { has $.name is required }; my Dog $d .= new(:name<fido>); say "my dog's name is {$d.name}";

[00:17] <zachk> thank you atweiden-air 

[00:19] <jnthn> Can also do it with $d.name()

[00:20] <zachk> nice, now how come just $d.name doesn't work? is it because of parsing?

[00:22] <holyghost> because $d.name is undefined then and you don't parse it

[00:23] <jnthn> It was decided to require some kind of postcircumfix on the end of dereference-like things inside of interpolation

[00:23] <jnthn> [email@hidden.address] and "data_$i.txt" being two obvious cases where it's more likely to be something to trip over instead of a help

[03:09] <daotoad1> I keep running into issues like this with slips and collection type constraints.  What am I doing wrong?  And what part of the docs will set me straight? 

[03:09] <timotimo> committable6: releases class Foo { has Int @.attr; }; my %foo = attr => [ 1, 2, 4 ]; my $foo = Foo.new(|%foo);

[03:10] *** AlexDaniel left
[03:10] <timotimo> it's probably a difference between assignment and binding

[03:10] <timotimo> m: my @bar = 1, 2, 3; my Int @foo = @bar

[03:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: ( no output )

[03:11] <timotimo> ^- this only works because the original @bar is iterated over and the individual items are put into @foo

[03:11] <timotimo> but i guess when you have @.attr and create the object with the default new method it will try to bind it?

[03:11] <timotimo> m: class Foo { has Int @.attr }; @(Foo.new.attr) = 1, 2, 3, 4

[03:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: ( no output )

[03:14] *** cfa left
[03:15] <daotoad1> If I say:  %foo.perl, I get {:attr($[1, 2, 4])}

[03:15] <timotimo> ooh

[03:15] <timotimo> it's containerized, so it'll actually do exactly what it says in the error message

[03:15] <timotimo> it tries to put the array into the first slot of the @.attr array

[03:16] <daotoad1> How do I prevent the containerization?

[03:16] <timotimo> and then it sees that what was supposed to be an Int was actually an Array

[03:16] <timotimo> m: my %attrs; %attrs<attr> := [1, 2, 3]; dd %attrs

[03:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: OUTPUT: «Hash %attrs = {:attr([1, 2, 3])}␤»

[03:16] <timotimo> that's one way i know of

[03:16] <timotimo> m: my %attrs = foo => [1, 2, 3]<>; dd %attrs

[03:16] <camelia> rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: OUTPUT: «Hash %attrs = {:foo($[1, 2, 3])}␤»

[03:17] <timotimo> this doesn't work, the hash constructor is apparently what creates the scalars

[03:21] <daotoad1> perl6: class Foo { has Int @.attr; }; my $foo = attr => [ 1, 2, 4 ]; my $f = Foo.new(|$foo);

[03:21] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 08b449e1a, rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: ( no output )

[03:22] <timotimo> interesting, it works with a pair, then? then you'd perhaps have to have one slip for every argument

[03:28] <daotoad1> Making a List also seems to work.

[03:29] <daotoad1> But as soon as I make a hash, either with a hash constructor on the RHS, or a sigil on the LHS, failure.

[03:34] <daotoad1> perl6: my %foo = attr => |[1,2,4]; say %foo.perl

[03:34] <camelia> rakudo-jvm 08b449e1a, rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: OUTPUT: «{:attr($(slip(1, 2, 4)))}␤»

[03:35] <daotoad1> Which also works for initializing an object.

[03:36] *** Aceeri left
[03:39] <daotoad1> Since there's an easy, non-verbose way of saying something that works, I am happy to see this as a case of "my expectations were broken". 

[03:40] <daotoad1> But I am pretty sure that this is also not documented anywhere.   I'm not sure what needs to change to help people expect this result.

[03:41] <timotimo> finding the right place in the docs to put something is a bit of an art

[03:41] <daotoad1> Perhaps in the Hash docs, it would be good to say that Hashes, by nature, force their values into containers.

[03:43] <daotoad1> So to make a literal Key => Array, you need a slip in there to unpack the container?

[03:44] <timotimo> i'm not entirely sure where exactly the slip gets unpacked

[03:44] <timotimo> probably inside the constructor when taking something from the positional args and assigning it into the attribute

[03:45] <daotoad1> I ran into the issue trying to apply a Hash to object initialization, so maybe a note with a link to the Hash docs also?

[03:45] <timotimo> yeah

[03:47] <daotoad1> Not sure I am up to actually writing the change myself, but I can definitely open an issue in the docs repo.

[03:48] <timotimo> that's a good start :)

[03:48] <daotoad1> Thanks for the help!

[03:49] <daotoad1> I messed around with this for like an hour the other night, you really helped me find the solution.

[03:50] <timotimo> no problem!

[03:50] <timotimo> feel free to come to irc earlier next time something's not quite working, or post to stackoverflow, or reddit, or ... ):

[03:50] <timotimo> :)

[03:51] <daotoad1> I was supposedly going to go to bed in 5 minutes and didn't want to start a long chat. :P

[03:51] <daotoad1> Instead I kept trying one more thing.

[03:51] <timotimo> ha, i know that feeling

[03:51] <timotimo> but irc is fine for quick chats, too

[03:52] <timotimo> the kind of quick chat that i don't like on irc is when people come in, ask a question, and leave two minutes later

[18:00] <zachk> how would I use a for loop to loop over an array nested in a hash? 

[18:00] <zachk>  my %h = x => {a => 1 , b => 2} , y => [[1, 2 ,3]]

[18:00] <zachk>  for %h{'y'} {.say}

[18:00] <zachk> that prints out the whole array not every element on a separate line 

[18:02] <koto> well, you have to either `@` it or convert to e.g. Seq, List or something like that.

[18:02] <koto> m: my %h = x => {a => 1 , b => 2} , y => [[1, 2 ,3]]; .say for @(%h<y>);

[18:04] <koto> well, very-very simplifying in "unpacks" a scalar that holds something that may be iterated and does number of things. For example, you can:

[18:05] <koto> m: sub a(:$a, :$b) { say $a + $b }; my %h = a => 1, b => 3; a(|%h);

[18:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar a5b9fc2de: OUTPUT: «4␤»

[18:08] <koto> in fact, you can do various cool things with Capture being first-class citizen, but that's another question. :)

[18:08] <tobs> m: my %h = x => {a => 1 , b => 2} , y => [[1, 2 ,3]]; .say for %h<y><>

[21:34] <scovit> Hello, it is possible to export symbols from a module that are imported from another module (and still be able to "use" both modules in the importing script)?

[21:35] <scovit> Trying to workaround this: Cannot import symbol Pointer from Robba::Buona, because it already exists in this lexical scope

[21:35] <Kaiepi> oh i missed some precomp files

[21:35] <Kaiepi> it works now

[21:35] <scovit> so that the user does not need to 'use NativeCall' just to get Pointer

[21:36] <scovit> and I do not have to define tens of opaque types

[21:36] *** moony joined
[21:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v moony

[21:37] <scovit> I guess that the answer is not.. what would be the idiomatic way to do that?

[21:38] *** domidumont left
[21:39] <scovit> class NativeAny is repr("CPointer")

[21:40] <scovit> and then s/Pointer/NativeAny/g ?

[21:40] <koto> I may be wrong, but likely not. Transitive import doesn't work in turn to be able to use different versions of the same module at the same time. But you can write a `sub EXPORT`(you can look it up on docs site) where you can manually re-export needed symbols.

[21:40] <scovit> I am doing it with sub EXPORT

[21:40] <koto> oh

[21:40] <zachk> does s///g not work in perl6? 

[21:41] <scovit> koto: the problem is that the used module would neet to check if the symbol is already thre

[21:41] <scovit> before exporting, to make it work

[21:41] <scovit> (and trust that it is the right symbol)

[21:42] <koto> cannot help with this one, sorry. :(

[21:43] <scovit> thanks for replying :)

[21:43] <scovit> it seems to me that it is like this by design and for some reason

[21:50] <Altreus> I've had to reinstall my OS and recovered my home dir, so I have the same $PATH and all my perl6 files, but I suspect I'm missing something at the system level because this happens https://gist.github.com/Altreus/c7fb5ab155f1693512ed629604c85a96

[21:51] <Altreus> perl6 itself seems to work

[21:59] <Altreus> it seems to happen regardless of what I try to install

[22:01] <lizmat> Altreus: perhaps some port blocking ?

[22:01] <Altreus> I can access the URLs from the browser

[22:01] <lizmat> weird

[22:01] <Altreus> the warning on the first line seems weird

[22:02] <Altreus> since @names doesn't appear on that line

[22:02] <Altreus> or in that file

[22:02] <lizmat> well, then you may have an older zef installed somewhere still ?

[22:04] <Altreus> rerunning make install in my rakudo build dir

[22:05] <Altreus> /home/altreus/perl6 -> /home/altreus/rakudo/rakudo-star-2018.04/install

[22:05] <Altreus> so both perl6 and zef are pointing to the same perl6 dir

[22:05] <Altreus> Is it entirely self-contained or is it expecting something to exist?

[22:05] <Altreus> hmmm

[22:11] <scovit> Is there a way to compose different pieces in a module? The way you do on Classes with Roles?

[22:11] * lizmat is not sure

[22:11] <lizmat> scovit: not sure what you mean

[22:12] <scovit> module B { our sub ciao { } }; module A is B { }, and then you can do A::ciao

[22:12] <Altreus> This has a test failure in LWP::Simple:ver<1.0.1> because IO::Socket::SSL is not installed

[22:13] <scovit> is it possible?

[22:13] <Altreus> it's the same 2018.04 I've had since ages ago so I'm guessing it fetched it from cpan

[22:14] <scovit> since right now I find myself using class methods (not instance methods) because I dont know how to achieve that

[22:14] <lizmat> scovit: no, because "is" is about object inheritance

[22:14] <lizmat> not about subs that happen to exist in a class

[22:15] <scovit> this seems like a more complex task than what I am trying to achieve
