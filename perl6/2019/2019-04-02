[13:26] <ugexe> Not sure I‚Äôll be able to figure out a polyglot base35 encoder and decoder. I think it‚Äôll require bitwise operations...

[13:27] <ugexe> Other than that something like Base64 is otherwise not that difficult to port to polyglot 

[13:27] <jnthn> Wonder if anyone knows whether a) we're really losing precision that exists in the .Rat conversion above, and b) if it's possible to do better?

[13:28] <ugexe> Perlglot 

[13:31] <jnthn> Ah, and alternatively, does anyone know of a slower, but more precise, way of dealing with franctional exponents on Rat if willing to pay for the calculation?

[13:34] *** curan left
[13:38] <tobs> jnthn: nothing short of full-blown algebraic numbers comes to mind

[13:40] <tobs> I remember how betrayed I felt by the "math that works" slogan in P6 talks when I discovered 2.sqrt is a Num and nto a polynomial :)

[13:41] <jnthn> Well, yeah, the concrete problem I have is that we picked Rat for precision in financial calcs, which makes sense, except there's like one formula that raises to a negative fractional power (I think some depreciation thingy) and dumps things back into Num land

[13:41] <jnthn> And then the conversion back to a Rat loses precision, so we're doing worse than Num all the way by that point :S

[13:42] <timotimo> you can build your own interval "search" algo

[13:42] <timotimo> to get arbitrarily amounts of precision

[13:42] <jnthn> I'm guessing there ain't a module for this already... :)

[13:42] <timotimo> not that i know of

[13:43] <timotimo> i do believe you'll tend to get irrational numbers when square-rooting and such

[13:43] <timotimo> and some-kind-of-rooting is what's part of fractional exponentiation

[13:43] *** maettu joined
[13:43] <jnthn> That's fine, I don't need all the precision, just not to do "worse than Excel" :P

[13:44] <jnthn> I'm still not sure if it's a shortcoming in Num.Rat, however

[13:44] <timotimo> you can probably use the regular formula that makes an ieee float from its three parts

[13:44] <timotimo> that'll give you a rational number "naturally"

[13:44] <timotimo> then you should be able to subtract from what .Rat gives you

[13:45] <timotimo> you probably know all this

[13:45] <timotimo> just saying i don't know of a better way off-hand

[13:45] <jnthn> Hmm...if we can get it that way "naturally" why is .Rat doing a convergence algorithm?

[13:46] <timotimo> so that the number is prettier i guess?

[13:46] <jnthn> Hm, perhaps, yes

[13:46] <timotimo> if you are okay with getting a fatrat, that's probably not necessary?

[13:46] <jnthn> Passing :fat and a tiny epsilon doesn't help, alas

[13:47] <jnthn> Hm, I'm guessing there's no better way to get the parts of a double than to just grab the bits?

[13:48] <timotimo> not to my knowledge

[13:48] <timotimo> it's probably not better to log2 the value

[13:48] <timotimo> or i guess log16

[13:48] <jnthn> aye

[13:49] <jnthn> Will try that out and see if it gets me more precision than the standard .Rat conversion

[13:49] <timotimo> i wonder if there's something easily reachable to get 128bit (or whatever) floating point arithmetic. like, via nativecall or something

[13:50] <jnthn> Dunno; I know it's tricky in MoarVM 'cus we assume all the VM registers are 64-bit wide

[13:50] <timotimo> aye, it'd have to be done with Buf8

[13:50] <timotimo> or CArray or whatever

[19:39] <woolfy> lizmat and I went to Concerto Record Store in Amsterdam because Todd Rundgren came over to sign his autobiography.  lizmat gave him a Camelia, and he was quite happy with it.  He knows about Perl.  He will check it out.

[19:59] <guifa> So three cheers for grammars/actions.  There was a proposal on the main Fluent project github to add a specific reference type that would basically combine two things that already existed.  Literally took five minutes to code it up and it seemed like it was going to actually be a substantial amount of work for the other languages / reference implementations :-)

[20:50] <jackfly26> im having issues with some grammars

[20:50] <jackfly26> theyre technically nqp but should be the same

[20:51] <jackfly26> p6: say (1..5).eager

[20:54] <jackfly26> whoms'td've is online

[20:54] <jackfly26> 11why my code no work

[20:57] <timotimo> hi

[20:59] <jackfly26> hi

[20:59] <timotimo> what kind of issue are you experiencing?

[20:59] <timotimo> it's not matching when you expect it to? or is there an exception or something?

[20:59] <jackfly26> kinda

[21:00] <jackfly26> https://hastebin.com/ebutuwitaq.xml

[21:00] <jackfly26> the function won't match when i use the brackets as parameters

[21:01] <timotimo> did you try any kind of tracing?

[21:01] <jackfly26> i cant

[21:01] <jackfly26> this is nqp

[21:01] <timotimo> then you haven't heard of --rxtrace yet!

[21:01] <timotimo> it's not very good, i don't think

[21:01] <jackfly26> well its running for parrotvm

[21:01] <jackfly26> so i dont do nqp command directly

[21:02] <timotimo> parrot you say?

[21:02] <jackfly26> yes

[21:02] <timotimo> i thought nqp doesn't run on parrot any more

[21:02] <jackfly26> well i guess it does

[21:03] <lucasb> what's your rakudo version? 

[21:03] <jackfly26> umm

[21:04] <jackfly26> again that shouldnt matter because its nqp

[21:04] <jackfly26> 6.c

[21:04] <lucasb> what's your nqp version? 

[21:04] <jackfly26> umm

[21:04] <jackfly26> i got it yesterday

[21:04] <timotimo> right, it shouldn't matter if you're not using any rakudo in your thing

[21:04] <lucasb> no, in months :)

[21:04] <jackfly26> oh

[21:04] <jackfly26> 2018.10 for perl6

[21:05] <jackfly26> oh its same for both

[21:05] *** vrurg joined
[21:06] <timotimo> i've long forgotten how to work with parrot

[21:06] <lucasb> I'm surprised nqp still works with it even :)

[21:06] <jackfly26> lol

[21:06] <jackfly26> well im using the pct

[21:06] <timotimo> i mean, there are no pir files in the nqp repo, so ... how does it even have anything to run?

[21:06] <timotimo> oh

[21:07] <timotimo> that's ...

[21:07] <jackfly26> also what does the red username mean

[21:07] <jackfly26> parrot compiler tools

[21:08] <timotimo> where does the pct live? in the parrot repository?

[21:08] <timotimo> ah yes

[21:09] <timotimo> well, i'm not sure what to tell you

[21:09] <Xliff> Is ::?CLASS lexical?

[21:09] <timotimo> the last meaningful change to ptc seems to from 2011

[21:10] <jackfly26> umm

[21:10] <timotimo> i don't think anybody in here can help you meaningfully with exactly what ptc can or can't do compared to the nqp we have

[21:10] <jackfly26> oof sorry i was on discord

[21:10] <jackfly26> its the same nqp i think

[21:10] <jackfly26> its just a perl 6 grammar too

[21:10] <timotimo> yeah, except it's a lot older

[21:10] <jackfly26> or soo parrot says

[21:10] <jackfly26> or so parrot says

[21:11] <timotimo> there have been some bugfixes to the grammar stuff in the last 8 years

[21:11] <jackfly26> oh

[21:11] <jackfly26> its 2018

[21:11] <jackfly26> version

[21:11] <jackfly26> so should be ok

[21:11] <timotimo> not sure when ptc and nqp diverged

[21:12] <jackfly26> pct*

[21:12] <timotimo> parrot doesn't seem to have a release newer than 2016, where did you get a ptc with a 2018 version number?

[21:13] <jackfly26> huh

[21:13] <jackfly26> yeah

[21:13] <jackfly26> lemme check the github

[21:14] <jackfly26> maybe it gets the latest version when i run make

[21:14] *** buffet joined
[21:15] <timotimo> what did you download and compile? how did you even find pct?

[21:15] <pmurias> jackfly26: why are you using parrot?

[21:17] <jackfly26> to work ona language

[21:17] <jackfly26> parrot.org had it in the tutorial

[21:17] <jackfly26> i just pulled from the parrot github

[21:17] <jackfly26> and ran Configure.pl make make install

[21:18] <jackfly26> also parrot says rakudo uses parrot

[21:18] <timotimo> rakudo dropped support for parrot a couple years back

[21:18] <jackfly26> also i just realized i ran nqp instead of parrot-nqp

[21:18] <jackfly26> so it is the 2016 version

[21:19] <timotimo> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/9a75383d91d690ec71c0f4f3440cb00432cc6f7c#diff-daffed346e29c5654f54133d1fc65ccb - february 2015

[21:19] <timotimo> http://pmthium.com/2015/02/suspending-rakudo-parrot/ - a blog post about it

[21:20] <timotimo> i'm sorry to say you're working off of a tutorial that may have bitrotted a little too much to be used 1:1

[21:20] <timotimo> however, there is good news

[21:21] <timotimo> https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course - check the "pre-built PDFs" link in the readme

[21:21] *** zachk joined
[21:22] <timotimo> though i guess if you continue to use parrot-nqp maybe things will work out? though you don't really have a way forward if you want to develop the language itself much further
