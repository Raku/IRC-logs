[04:00] <dominix> hi everyone

[04:00] <adu> hi

[04:00] <dominix> how do I compare to .. list or array ? 

[04:01] <dominix> how do I compare two .. list or array ? 

[04:01] <dominix> sorry

[04:01] <dominix> m: say "ok" if (a b c) = (a b c);

[04:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 845433b47: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routines:␤    a used at line 1␤    b used at line 1␤    c used at line 1␤␤»

[04:02] <adu> »~~«?

[04:02] <dominix> I have something that return (a b c) and I want to compare to same thing

[04:02] <adu> oh as a whole, not elementwise

[04:02] <dominix> m: say "ok" if (a b c) ~~ (a b c);

[04:04] <MasterDuke> dominix: regular parens don't create lists/arrays. you either need <> or commas between your elements

[04:04] *** dominix_ joined

[04:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 845433b47: OUTPUT: «(List)(List)(Array)␤»

[04:06] <dominix_> ok; that <> vs () confuse me

[04:07] *** dominix left
[04:08] <adu> are there perl6 implementations of awk/sed?

[04:09] <MasterDuke> adu: not that i'm aware of

[04:09] *** dominix_ left
[04:10] <adu> is it because it would be too easy?

[04:10] *** dominix joined
[04:12] <MasterDuke> adu: no idea, but a possible problem is that the -n and -p flags for Perl 6 aren't quite perfect, and -i isn't implemented yet at all

[17:05] <mst> hang fire for a bit, hopefully mitigations will be incoming

[17:05] <mst> like, say, wait 24h or so and *then* deploy the bot

[17:06] <AlexDaniel> mst: thank you, that's what I was hoping for

[17:06] <mst> while I'm not going to reveal details in a public channel since that would risk providing information to the enemy, I can confirm that discussions are underway

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> I also wish there was a way to let Sigyn moderate the first message

[17:07] <AlexDaniel> so that the user is kicked before everybody can see the message… but I understand that might not be possible…

[17:08] <discord6> <Rogue> That's bot-based moderation for you

[17:08] <discord6> <Rogue> One of the many reasons I dislike Discord

[17:08] <AlexDaniel> why?

[17:08] <mst> that was discussed, but it turned out to be aggravatingly complex in terms of how to get everything to work

[17:09] <mst> fortunately, we came up with an alternative plan that wasn't

[17:12] <antoniogamiz> ah okay, thanks a lot! and as fot the issues that requires  changes in the docs?

[17:48] <AlexDaniel> .tell rindolf actually, now that I look at it, `%… = True` lines take around 4 seconds or so, so it's not just the regexes being slow!! Maybe that can be isolated into a benchmark

[17:48] <yoleaux> AlexDaniel: I'll pass your message to rindolf.

[17:50] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: maybe you're interested in that ↑ ? It seems like `%h{$a}{$b}{$c} = True` in a loop with different abcs is really slow

[17:53] <antoniogamiz> negative zero support is documented in language/numerics but not in Num, is that valid?

[17:57] *** rindolf joined
[17:57] <jdv79> so a start block in sink context has a default exception handler but a then in sink does not?

[18:53] <jmerelo> antoniogamiz: it's a default method, which is in Any, I think. Normally it's not included in every subclass. You can either add something in the intro, or mention wherever you think it's necessary. Or if you find some reference like "this does not work" change it to "from 6.d, this works OK"

[18:54] <jmerelo> antoniogamiz: in some cases that the previous behavior is not mentioned and what happens is What Should Happen (TM) just check the mark and go on to the next one.

[18:55] <antoniogamiz> jmerelo: I think I'll do that hahaaha

[18:55] <antoniogamiz> and I'll make a pr with the next check because I gotta leave in a while

[20:25] <rindolf> AlexDaniel: hi

[20:25] <yoleaux> 17:43Z <AlexDaniel> rindolf: it looks like the regex itself is the bottleneck in that script. You can still make it faster, and I tried something like this: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/2d5a6107d2f8bc950bd7b8c00d9240d7

[20:25] <yoleaux> 17:44Z <AlexDaniel> rindolf: keep in mind that `say` takes a second or two by itself, and maybe perl5 is faster in that case because there's no buffering by default? I'm not sure…

[20:25] <yoleaux> 17:45Z <AlexDaniel> rindolf: it only went down for me from 9+ seconds to 6+, so definitely not the improvement we were looking for

[20:25] <yoleaux> 17:48Z <AlexDaniel> rindolf: actually, now that I look at it, `%… = True` lines take around 4 seconds or so, so it's not just the regexes being slow!! Maybe that can be isolated into a benchmark

[20:26] <rindolf> AlexDaniel: thanks

[20:27] <rindolf> AlexDaniel: you've commented out some data validation

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> rindolf: I know, I think it doesn't make any difference in terms of performance

[20:28] <AlexDaniel> I was just trying to isolate the issue

[22:25] <elcaro> rindolf: Regex is pretty slow in Perl 6, so avoid it if you can. 'my ($s, $e, $sum) = $line.words[2, 6, 10]' should shave a bit of time

[22:25] *** rootd00d left
[22:26] <rindolf> elcaro: ah

[22:27] <rindolf> elcaro: i also want to make sure theline is fmted well

[22:33] <elcaro> rindolf: I would just run the input through `column` first :D

[22:33] <elcaro> column -t -s '' e658log2par.txt

[22:33] <elcaro> oh, you also want to make sure the key names (ie. start =) are there too

[22:33] <elcaro> right

[22:35] <elcaro> you could write a validator using a lot of `$line.substr(...)` checks, but it'd be a bit tedious
