[10:13] <tbrowder> .ask jmerelo want me to delete module Foo::Bar?

[10:13] <yoleaux> tbrowder: I'll pass your message to jmerelo.

[10:17] <jmerelo> tbrowder: if it's yours, it would probably be better off the ecosystem

[10:17] <yoleaux> 10:13Z <tbrowder> jmerelo: want me to delete module Foo::Bar?

[10:18] <tbrowder> i'm happy to delete it, but what prob is it causing?

[10:19] <jmerelo> tbrowder: well, modules should be there if they have some functionality. If they were used for testing something and they're no longer used, it's probably better if you delete them.

[10:19] <jmerelo> tbrowder: but where's that module?

[10:20] <jmerelo> Ah, OK, I found it.

[10:20] <tbrowder> ok, will delete from cpan right now, afk&

[16:26] <Xliff> Is there a way to introspect a block to see if it catches a specific exception type?

[16:42] *** molaf joined
[17:05] <MasterDuke> m: { CATCH { when X::IO { note "i/o error"; } } }.phasers("CATCH").say

[17:06] <MasterDuke> not sure why nothing is returned for `CATCH`...

[17:11] <tobs> but I suspect the exception types handled in CATCH are beyond reach.

[17:11] <MasterDuke> jnthn, timotimo, lizmat: ^^^ should that work for CATCH/BEGIN/INIT/CHECK/CONTROL (some of the ones i tried that don't work) like it does for PRE/POST/LEAVE (some of the ones i tried that do work)?

[17:12] <MasterDuke> tobs: yeah, that might not be possible since they'd be in when blocks

[17:13] <timotimo> aye, it's completely programmatic, not declarative

[17:14] <MasterDuke> but it looks like you should be able to see if there is a CATCH phaser at all

[17:14] <Xliff> MasterDuke++: So it sounds like I'd have to enhance the grammar and get that data stored, somehow. :/

[17:17] <MasterDuke> m: { LEAVE { when X::IO { note "i/o error"; } } }.has-phaser("LEAVE").say; { CATCH { when X::IO { note "i/o error"; } } }.has-phaser("CATCH").say   # simpler example

[17:17] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «1␤0␤»

[17:17] <MasterDuke> timotimo: should that work for CATCH, etc?

[17:17] <timotimo> i dunno, i haven't used those yet

[17:17] <MasterDuke> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Block.pm6#L50-L53

[17:18] <MasterDuke> i'll create an issue before i forget

[17:23] <MasterDuke> also, should the code in has-phasers be wrapped in an nqp::hllbool to make it a true Bool?
