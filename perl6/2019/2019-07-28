[12:10] <sena_kun> let's see...

[12:13] <sena_kun> hmm, curl understands it, I think so should we

[12:27] *** rindolf joined
[12:36] <sena_kun> hmm, this is a bit involved...

[12:40] <sena_kun> ah, it is not

[12:50] <ugexe> maybe because \_ isn’t a valid escape sequence 

[12:50] <sena_kun> yeah

[12:50] <sena_kun> writing an answer now...

[12:57] <draxil> Hi. Is there a perl6y way to do "which $MYCOMMAND"? Basically I want to test for the presence of a command in a test, and bail out if it's not present. 

[12:58] <sena_kun> https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-file-which ?

[13:00] <sena_kun> you can, of course, write it by hands

[13:01] <draxil> Thanks.Good to know that exists. I probably don't want to add a dependency here. In hindsight I should probably just try and run the command and bail out.

[13:01] <sena_kun> give me a second...

[13:01] <draxil> ..if it fails. Perhaps I should look at the error you get for not being able to find the thing

[13:01] <nepugia> draxil: if you want to run the command run "command -v" not which

[13:01] <sena_kun> I am now writing a two-liner...

[13:02] <draxil> thanks.

[13:02] <sena_kun> m: my @paths = %*ENV<PATH>.split(':'); for @paths -> $path { if $path.IO.child('cat').e { say "cat is found at $path" } }

[13:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «cat is found at /usr/bin␤cat is found at /bin␤»

[13:03] <sena_kun> this is GNU/Linux only, so apparently won't work on Windows and probably OSX

[13:03] <sena_kun> alternatively, of course, you can just try to run it and see the output

[13:03] <draxil> thanks .

[13:03] <nepugia> command -v is POSIX anyhow, that should def work on osx

[13:05] <ugexe> The not nice thing about trying commands that might not exist is that enough of those tries will deadlock you 

[13:05] <draxil> that's just leave windows, which would probably require other modifications anyway. Is there much perl6 in windows? Anyway. You've been helpful cheers.

[13:06] <ugexe> Yes people are using perl6 on windows 

[13:07] * ugexe wonders if one dependency is really that bad

[13:08] <nepugia> You start with one dep, and soon you have two :)

[13:08] <timotimo> i think we have a variable that gives you the separator of $PATH

[13:08] <ugexe> So you grow an entire project with 0 dependencies out of fear of a second dependency?

[13:09] <nepugia> but of course ;)

[13:09] <draxil> probably not, I haven't gotten to the packaging side yet.. I'm probably overthinking every step as this but I haven't released anything into the wild for Perl6 yet so I don;t have confirmed biases and habits yet :)

[13:11] <ugexe> Something that requires a bunch of crap to work cross platform is a good candidate for a dependency, unlike e.g. leftpad 

[13:13] <timotimo> i mean, it's easy to get leftpad wrong

[13:14] <ugexe> Chances are they are already doing a bunch of shit wrong because they are programmers. So who cares 

[13:14] <timotimo> yeah, maybe

[13:15] <timotimo> at least in perl6 you're not accidentally cutting characters in half

[13:15] * sena_kun does that in repl all the time

[13:16] <ugexe> Leftpad, but multithreaded 

[13:17] <timotimo> multipadding

[13:17] <chloekek> One thread for each transitive dependency, be careful not to reach threads-max!

[19:18] <Xliff> Can someone tell me why Perl6 throws an error when two signatures match, but they are at a different level of the MRO?

[19:19] <Xliff> If I have a class C, that is a descendant of class A, why isn't class C's method chosen over class A's?

[19:19] <Xliff> Both methods have a matching signature.

[19:20] <timotimo> is it the type constraint on the invocant that's doing it?

[21:25] <sena_kun> irced, can you provide a bit more of your log? I am sure there should be some reasons for tests to fail, but nobody can guess them with only a fact that tests are failing for someone somewhere?

[21:26] <irced> sena_kun: cpan-p6 announced the new module. perhaps you can try yourself?

[21:26] <sena_kun> irced, I tried, I don't have libgtk-3 installed.

[21:26] <irced> sena_kun: i do have libgtk-3 installed. did you get the same error tho?

[21:27] <sena_kun> irced, I don't know what error you are getting, so I can't tell if they are the same.

[21:28] <irced> sena_kun: well, without getting too specific, the the test failed on  ===> Testing:

[21:48] <Elronnd> "Could not find Gnome::Gdk3::Events at line 40 in"

[21:49] <irced> Elronnd: thanks for confirming it's not an isolated issue (at least not completely)

[21:50] <lizmat> weekly: https://p6steve.wordpress.com/2019/07/28/mind-the-gap/

[21:50] <notable6> lizmat, Noted!

[21:55] <irced> maybe it's just a 0.17.6 thing and 0.17.7 will be available shortly

[21:58] * irced found the tarbell for 0.17.7. same deal

[21:58] <irced> has anyone successfully installed a recent version of Gnome::Gtk3 ?

[21:58] <irced> Elronnd: what linux distribution are you using?

[21:58] <Elronnd> arch

[21:59] <irced> gentoo here. do you have gtk3 development files installed?

[21:59] <Elronnd> (also, how do you know I'm running linux?)

[21:59] <Elronnd> you don't need development files

[21:59] <irced> Elronnd: have you installed this module before?

[21:59] <Elronnd> what are called 'dev files' are for developing with c.  These *are* dev files for p6

[21:59] <irced> Elronnd: just libraries

[21:59] <Elronnd> I don't think I have

[22:00] <irced> Elronnd: just libraries i see

[22:00] <Elronnd> on arch they're not separate

[22:00] <irced> Elronnd: or that :-)

[22:00] <Elronnd> :)

[22:04] <irced> Elronnd: I just assume everyone runs linux and is as scared of microsoft as i am.

[22:04] <irced> Elronnd: and other big tech.

[22:05] <Elronnd> ms is not very scary.  Nor apple.  I can't stand windows nor macos but they're fine

[22:05] <Elronnd> Scary is google and facebook and tencent

[22:06] <irced> Elronnd: oh, ok, well, that's good, you're well adjusted 😄at least more than I am

[22:06] <Elronnd> lol

[22:07] <Elronnd> the main thing is just, ms can survive without windows.  They can sell support contracts for exactly the same price.  Google can't survive without taking away everyone's freedom

[22:08] <irced> Elronnd: I see, some are relatively scarier. Nice observation.

[22:09] <irced> Elronnd: how long you been coding in perl6?

[22:09] <Elronnd> well

[22:10] <Elronnd> I started learning it seriously a good few months ago

[22:10] <Elronnd> but I dropped off.  Been focusing on other things

[22:10] <Elronnd> you?

[22:12] <irced> Elronnd: I started and dropped off a few months ago and am now getting into the details.

[22:16] <irced> Elronnd: these types are a mental trip. like Range List Seq Array and their relations feel like astronomical science with relativity in the mix.

[22:18] <irced> Elronnd: in other words, positionals. did i miss one?

[22:18] <Elronnd> no idea

[22:18] <Elronnd> I never got that deep into all the types

[22:18] <irced> 😄

[22:19] <irced> Elronnd: well, you will 😄

[22:20] <Elronnd> if I get the time!

[22:20] <Elronnd> I have too many projects in other languages

[22:21] <irced> Elronnd: right, time. time is the key to learning a programming language. what other languages?

[22:21] <Elronnd> main one right now is d

[22:21] <irced> Elronnd: whoa, you like to stay on the fringe.

[22:21] <Elronnd> heh

[22:22] <Elronnd> also gonna write a WM for arcan

[22:22] <Elronnd> also want to fix the web, which probably involves a lot of c++ and python

[22:23] *** Cabanossi left
[22:23] <irced> Elronnd: what's arcan ? yeah, the web feels like a spider web what with privacy concerns abound.

[22:24] <sena_kun> Array is, well, an array of things you can address by index, List is an immutable array, range is a range of usually numbers of strings, think "from 1 to 10", "from a to z", "from pi to infinity" and so on, Seq is something that produces values lazily.

[22:24] <Elronnd> arcan is a display server, competitor to x11 and wayland except unlike both of them it's actually sanely designed

[22:24] <Elronnd> I actually don't want to fix the privacy issues.  I mean, I'd like them to be solved but I don't think that can be done

[22:24] <Elronnd> I mainly want to solve the developing-for-web-is-a-clusterfuck and using-web-is-a-clusterfuck problems

[22:26] <irced> Elronnd: yeah, i hope to use perl6 to help me develop more fluidly in other languages, which it seems to be in part made for, supposedly trumping all lex'ers with its versatility....

[22:26] <irced> sena_kun: good summary

[22:27] <Elronnd> hmm.  I didn't take anything from it to other languages.  But yeah that was what I took from it; it's so fluid I can do whatever I want

[22:28] <irced> i once was blind and now i can see!

[22:28] <Elronnd> m: .say for (1 ... 10)

[22:28] <irced> thanks sena_kun. i made the sequence non-lazy and it behaved like a list

[22:29] <Elronnd> hmm

[22:30] <irced> for seems to take ( ... ) as a list when you define the sequence in the for statement

[22:30] <irced> that it, it assumes it will not be lazy

[22:30] <irced> as after all, every value will be iterated upon

[22:30] <irced> now i can see even better

[22:37] <irced> tobs: itemization of a sequence, that's new to me, thanks

[22:37] <ugexe> .cache, .Array, etc

[22:37] <tobs> $seq is inside a scalar container, so for sees only a single element. If you call a method like .eager or even .self (which doesn't remove the laziness), you get rid of the container.

[22:37] <irced> m: my $seq = ( 20 .. 30 ); my $counter=0; for |$seq { say "{$counter++}: $_"; }

[22:38] <irced> tobs: excellent!

[22:38] <irced> itemization of a sequence is key for "for" to iterate over each member of the sequence

[22:38] * irced no really.

[22:39] <irced> 😄

[22:39] <irced> tobs: the binding part is going to take awhile for me to get completely i think

[22:41] <ugexe> you do make ranges with 2 dots

[22:41] <irced> yeah, i started with sequences

[22:41] <tobs> irced: I found this helpful (and it became more ever more helpful after I read it the 10th time): https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/perl-6-sigils-variables-and-containers/

[22:44] <irced> oh yes, i know, but it's the for loop operating on ranges and sequences requiring itemization that i was not really seeing until now

[22:45] <irced> the for loop treats the sequence/range as a single entity unless itemized or slipped

[22:46] <ugexe> no its treating the sequence as a *single item*

[23:48] <irced> it is hard to see, but flat does not treat the sublists individually

[23:48] <irced> nevertheless, i appreciate your observation about archaic syntax

[23:51] <irced> sorry for the spam, anyway, ugexe, flat does not treat sublists individually in the for loop, but i see what you're saying, thanks again

[23:51] *** sauvin left
[23:52] *** sauvin joined
[23:53] <irced> ugexe, though i could use flat in the innermost for loop

[23:53] <irced> 😄

[23:53] * irced gives camelia a break.

[23:55] *** aborazmeh joined
[23:55] *** aborazmeh left
[23:55] *** aborazmeh joined
[23:59] <irced> ugexe, then again, I moved the discussion beyond iterating over a sequence and the outer loop was not a sequence or a range so you're absolutely right. thanks again.
