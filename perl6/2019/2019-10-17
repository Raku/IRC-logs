[10:23] <xinming_> m: slip(2,3).perl.say; |(2,3).perl.say;

[10:24] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «slip(2, 3)␤(2, 3)␤»

[10:24] <xinming_> In my understanding,  that the slip(2, 3)   will create an slip object, but  |(2, 3) won't, it'll expand the list item,   Is my udnerstanding correct?

[10:25] <xinming_> and another quesiton, How do we create a "raw" container for array when we do   @array.push:  ?

[10:25] <lizmat> m: dd slip(2,3)

[10:25] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «slip(2, 3)␤»

[10:25] <lizmat> m: dd |(2,3)

[10:25] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «2␤3␤»

[10:25] <lizmat> hmmm...

[10:25] <xinming_> Let's say,      my @x = (2, 3);    my @result;  @result.push: @x.map: * + 1;

[10:25] <lizmat> m: dd $|(2,3)

[10:25] <xinming_> m:  my @x = (2, 3);    my @result;  @result.push: @x.map: * + 1;

[10:25] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «any(Any, (2, 3))␤»

[10:25] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «»

[10:25] <lizmat> he

[10:25] <xinming_> m:  my @x = (2, 3);    my @result;  @result.push: @x.map: * + 1;   @result.perl.say;

[10:25] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «[(3, 4).Seq,]␤»

[10:26] <lizmat> m: dd $(|(2,3))

[10:26] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «$(slip(2, 3))␤»

[10:26] <lizmat> hmmm...

[10:26] <xinming_> In this example, How can I make the   @x.map: * + 1     returns the raw cotnainer?

[10:26] <xinming_> So, I don't need to use slip  or force  something liek   @result.push:  |(@x.map: * + 1);

[10:27] <xinming_> @result.push:  slip @x.map: * + 1;

[10:27] <lizmat> use .append

[10:28] <xinming_> Thanks, let me try.

[10:28] <lizmat> m: my @a =1,2,3; @a.append( (4,5,6) ); dd @a

[10:28] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]␤»

[10:28] <xinming_> m:  my @x = (2, 3);    my @result;  @result.append: @x.map: * + 1;

[10:28] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «»

[10:28] <lizmat> m: my @a =1,2,3; @a.push( (4,5,6) ); dd @a

[10:28] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6)]␤»

[10:28] <xinming_>  m: my @a =1,2,3; @a.append( @(4,5,6) ); dd @a

[10:28] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]␤»

[10:28] <xinming_>  m: my @a =1,2,3; @a.append( $(4,5,6) ); dd @a

[10:28] <evalable6> xinming_, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «Array @a = [1, 2, 3, (4, 5, 6)]␤»

[10:28] <xinming_> So, understanable.

[10:28] <xinming_> thanks.

[10:29] <xinming_> lizmat: Then,  slip(xxx)   is the same as    |(xxx)    right?

[10:29] <xinming_> the | is just a syntax sugar

[10:30] <lizmat> yeah, but there appears to be a subtle difference wrt to "dd", but that could be an artefact of how "dd" works

[10:30] <lizmat> m: say (slip(2,3)).perl

[10:30] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «slip(2, 3)␤»

[10:30] <lizmat> m: say (|(2,3)).perl

[10:30] <evalable6> lizmat, rakudo-moar f3dda96a8: OUTPUT: «slip(2, 3)␤»

[10:30] <lizmat> yeah, artefact of dd

[12:26] <finanalyst_> I was wondering which should be the cannon?

[12:27] <finanalyst_> Also in this channel, I note that some bots, eg. benchable6 have name in user list, but camelia does not

[12:27] <finanalyst_> So, how can I discover which bots are active?
