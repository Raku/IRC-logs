[07:34] <brrt> folks, I was asked yesterday, 'what is scripting'.

[07:35] <brrt> my answer was, 'scripting is when you control a large system (which is implied by context) with a small program'

[07:35] <brrt> a): do you agree, b): is Perl6 properly a scripting language, according to that definition, c): is it a *good* scripting language?

[07:36] <brrt> e.g. for javascript, the 'large system' would be the browser. For perl5, the 'large system' would be the UNIX environment and the POSIX interface that perl5 provides

[07:37] <brrt> For a lua script embedded in a larger C/C++ program, the C/C++ program is, obviously, the large system / implied environment

[07:39] <brrt> and d): what is, precisely, the large system controlled by perl6 programs.

[07:39] *** tyil[m]1 left
[07:39] <brrt> I think the answer to d) is the answer to the question 'what is perl6's niche'

[07:54] <patrickb> brrt: a) yes (there are probably other good definitions, but I like this one) b) yes c) yes, it can be used unakwardly in such contexts d) there can be many answers. I have used p6 for poke-files-around-do-some-regex tasks quite some. So it does file the perl5/UNIX niche well too.

[07:55] <masak> lazyweb question: someone like Kernighan (but not necessarily Kernighan) once implemented (or just designed) a "better shell than bash". there were great simplifications in how quoting worked, for example. what's the name of the shell, and where's the article he wrote where he described this that I can't find right now despite looking?

[07:56] <brrt> masak: haven't heard of it

[07:58] <masak> he was quite clear that bash, as languages go, was not up to the task

[08:07] <masak> I'm currently trying to explain to a more junior friend why there are so many scripts written in bash, when Perl and Python exist, are better languages, and allow for more flexible/safe/manageable code

[08:10] <patrickb> For me it's mostly easy copy-paste-ablity of what I already tried in the console + bash being more widely available than the Ps.

[08:10] *** Manifest0 joined
[08:15] <rfold> Clearly those were not better languages in the eye of the script authors.

[08:36] <Skarsnik> It can be defined in the constructeur I guess without the code using the class to define x

[10:17] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, I think it is useful. when sending a patch, running tests is faster than doing a full build.

[10:19] <antoniogamiz> mmm it takes a big time though, I said it because I'm trying to integrate the Pod::To::Cached module 

[10:19] <antoniogamiz> and only compile pods once in the whole process

[10:19] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, but testing and building are two separate processes, no?

[12:48] <yoleaux> 24 Mar 2019 23:28Z <TreyHarris> grondilu: I think you want `.ACCEPTS(Array) && .all ~~ Num given [pi]`

[12:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82fc4e570: OUTPUT: «hi␤»

[12:48] <grondilu> TreyHarris: can you remind me what this was about?

[12:49] <grondilu> anyway .ACCEPTS(Array) is really an ungly notation.

[12:49] <grondilu> IMHO

[12:51] <Altreus> ahoy! I've got a %json from a deserialised JSON object and I'm trying to use it as a constructor (indirectly). However, if I have an array in the JSON structure and an @ in the class I'm constructing, I end up with the JSON array being the first element of the object's array property, rather than the entirety of it

[12:51] <Altreus> «dd %json» shows me :roles($["506956809471262731", "506956997543985222"])

[12:51] <Altreus> This seems clear that it would go in as a scalar into the array instead of being the entire array, but how can I stop this?

[12:52] <grondilu> you want to use an instance as a constructor o.O?

[12:52] <Altreus> I don't want to have to meticulously pick apart %json to turn them into real arrays but I can probably deal with a quick x for %json.values

[12:52] <Altreus> what :)

[12:52] <Altreus> I want to use a hash as a constructor?

[12:52] <Altreus> Class.new(|%json)

[12:53] <grondilu> That's not how you instantiate a class in Perl 6

[12:53] <Altreus> It has been so far

[12:53] <Altreus> What should I be doing?

[12:53] <grondilu> hang on

[12:54] <timotimo> ah, i think this is a problem often encountered, isn't it?

[12:54] <grondilu> oh wait I may have confused this with Perl 5 instantiation for a bit.

[12:54] <Altreus> xD

[12:54] <grondilu> I haven't coded in Perl 6 for a while either lol

[12:54] <Altreus> perl5 would be easy because it's always a reference

[12:55] <grondilu> perl5 is not as fun as perl6 though

[12:55] <Altreus> no but it's way quicker for me to write :D

[12:55] <Altreus> I don't have to keep asking IRC about core language principles

[12:55] <Altreus> hopefully perl6 will go the same way soon

[12:56] <grondilu> What was confusing is what you wrote is that you talked about using %json as a constructor, but what you were realy talking about is construction parameters.

[12:56] <grondilu> *in what you

[12:56] <Altreus> ah yeah, that is true

[12:56] <grondilu> Have you read the Apocalipse?

[12:56] <grondilu> *Apocalypses

[12:56] <Altreus> Nope

[12:56] <grondilu> I find they are the best docs.

[12:56] <Altreus> I was hoping there was a book called the Apocalisp

[12:56] <jnthn> Altreus: Class.new(|%json.Map) should remove the containerization

[13:17] <rba> AlexDaniel: Thanks for adding me. Just invited brm-ryd to the perl6 org.

[13:17] <AlexDaniel> 👍

[13:18] <grondilu> I've found the specs I was talking about.

[13:19] <grondilu> I'll make a html mirror

[13:22] <grondilu> hum... weird, I can't find my grondilu.github.io repo

[13:23] <grondilu> ok, found it.

[13:25] <grondilu> oh I found my local clone

[13:25] *** vrurg joined
[13:26] <grondilu> oh my bad, I think it wasn't pushed or something

[13:26] <rfold> Does anyone else get a HSTS error when visiting https://marketing.perl6.org ?

[13:27] <rfold> Seems like an expired certificate.

[13:28] *** bbkr left
[13:28] <rfold> Oh no, the domain of the certificate is wrong, it's for perl6.nl instead of marketing.perl6.org

[13:37] *** Manifest0 left
[13:42] <grondilu> Someone earlier was asking for good docs.  IMHO https://github.com/perl6/specs are the best.

[13:43] <grondilu> too bad they are not available in html though

[13:43] <grondilu> though I thought they were somewhere.

[13:48] <candr> I have some subs that have a lot of parameters and was thinking about just passing around a struct instead.... is the best thing to use in perl6 for this a class? 

[13:48] <AlexDaniel> grondilu: they were, before the infrastructure collapsed :)

[13:48] <lucs> Is there any special reason why IO::Path doesn't supply a file test for sockets?

[13:49] <AlexDaniel> grondilu: http://design.perl6.org/ it was I think

[13:50] *** brrt left
[13:51] <AlexDaniel> grondilu: but, I mean… what's good about them? They're mostly outdated, and they talk about the design which is not strictly important for the end user

[13:53] <jnthn> candr: Yes, probably.

[13:55] <candr> I thought it might be weird to start passing around class object just for parameters without going full blown oo and making methods and all that

[14:00] <jnthn> Just 'cus it says "class" doesn't mean there's any real OO going on. And for a simple parameter object there's no methods to write; just `class Foo { has $.bar; has $.baz; }` :)

[14:00] <timotimo> maybe even "class Foo is rw { ... }"

[14:00] <timotimo> then all attributes will be re-assignable at any time

[14:00] <timotimo> if you want that, of course

[14:43] <grondilu> guys, I have a 11Mo tar file of the old specs

[14:43] <grondilu> what is the best way to publish it nowadays?

[14:44] <grondilu> Those specs were summaries of the Apocalypses.  I learned Perl 6 with them.

[14:45] <grondilu> It started as :

[14:45] *** epony left
[14:45] <grondilu> damn I can't copy paste for some reason

[14:48] <grondilu> "This document originally Apocalypse 1, which covers the initial design concept."

[14:48] *** breinbaas joined
[14:49] <grondilu> "That original summary may be found below under 'Random Thoughts'."

[14:49] <grondilu> oops I missed a word in the first sentence.

[14:50] <grondilu> "This document originally summarized Apocalypse 1, which covers the initial design concept."

[14:54] <grondilu> "However, these synopses also contain updates to reflect the evolving design of Perl 6 over time, unlike the Apocalypses, which are frozen in time as historical documents."

[14:55] <grondilu> "These updates are not marked--if a synopses disagrees with its Apocalypse, assume the synopsis is correct."

[14:55] <lucasb> wow, only now I see https://design.perl6.org/ is being redirect to the docs site

[14:56] <grondilu> I just relized I could just take a picture.

[14:56] *** xiaoyafeng left
[14:56] <grondilu> of my screen, that is.

[14:57] *** molaf joined
[14:57] <lucasb> well, the HTML version of those POD5 documents can be browsed in e.g. https://github.com/perl6/specs/blob/master/S01-overview.pod

[14:57] <lucasb> was that what you are talking about? :)

[14:58] <tyil> what's the way to check for the latest available rakudo-star on rakudo.org? https://rakudo.org/latest/star/source is still doing 500 errors from what I can tell

[15:02] *** patrickb left
[15:03] <grondilu> There is more than S01

[15:05] *** candr left
[15:05] <grondilu> S02 was about bits

[15:05] <grondilu> I've posted a screenshot on Facebook

[15:10] <grondilu> oh no worries, it turns out they are all on https://github.com/perl6/specs/blob/master/

[15:10] *** sena_kun joined
[15:11] *** jkramer joined
[15:11] <jkramer> Ahoy

[15:11] <grondilu> lizmat: do you still have access to this repo?

[15:11] <jkramer> m: my %h = :lol<123>, :foo<asd>; 'foo' ~~ /$<asd>=({%h.keys})/; dd $<asd>

[15:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82fc4e570: OUTPUT: «Match.new(from => 0, list => (), pos => 0, orig => "foo", made => Any, hash => Map.new(()))␤»

[15:11] <jkramer> How do I do this correctly? I want to match any key of %h.

[15:12] <grondilu> what is it you want to do?

[15:13] <grondilu> try to explain it ELI5

[15:13] <grondilu> or don't, nevermind

[15:14] <jkramer> Well I'd expect this to be evaluated the same way an array would, like here: https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Quoted_lists_are_LTM_matches

[15:14] <moritz> m: my %h = :lol<123>, :foo<asd>; my @keys = %h.keys; say 'foo' ~~ / @keys /

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82fc4e570: OUTPUT: «｢foo｣␤»

[15:14] <timotimo> i'd expect it also to work with @(%h.keys) in the regex

[15:14] <grondilu> jkramer: have you checked on rosettacode.org?

[15:14] <moritz> jkramer: attention, {} is a code block for side effects

[15:14] <jkramer> Ahh, I see. Thanks! :)

[15:14] <moritz> its return value is not used by the regex engine

[15:15] <moritz> so, create an array outside the regex

[15:15] <moritz> 'cause otherwise, the regex engine needs to re-evaluate the expression in each backtracking step

[15:15] <moritz> which will be horribly slow

[15:16] <jkramer> Yep, I kinda thought it works the same as {} in strings. Speed is not an issue here, just trying some stuff

[15:17] <grondilu> I'm off, see you later guys.

[15:17] *** grondilu left
[15:18] *** brrt left
[15:20] <moritz> there are interpolating code blocks as well, <?{ ... }> if memory serves right

[15:22] *** epony joined
[15:25] <timotimo> no, that's for True/False

[15:26] <timotimo> interpolating regex code would be <{ }>

[15:29] <moritz> ah, thanks timotimo :D

[15:29] <moritz> I forgot all that after I wrote a book about it :D

[16:07] <rfold> p6: class C { has %.tags is Set[Str:D]; }

[16:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82fc4e570: OUTPUT: «===SORRY!===␤Object of type Set[Str:D] in QAST::WVal, but not in SC␤»

[16:08] <rfold> What does this error message mean?

[16:09] <jnthn> It's an internal compiler error

[16:10] <jnthn> (And so implies a compiler bug of some sort)

[16:11] <lizmat> hmmm.... maybe we should disallow that for now?

[16:11] <jnthn> Or figure out the bug :)

[16:11] <lizmat> I'm not sure what the semantics would be

[16:12] <lizmat> it being an immutable Set ?

[16:12] <rfold> jnthn: thanks :D

[16:19] *** domidumont joined
[16:23] *** Kaiepi joined
[16:24] <jnthn> lizmat: Oh, right, 'cus it's on an attribute... Well, arguably the STORE in a newly created object is initialization....

[16:25] <lizmat> yeah, but what if you do it in a TWEAK ?

[16:25] <jnthn> Tough luck, I guess :)

[16:26] <jnthn> Though we could maybe treat such an assignment in TWEAK/BUILD as initial also

[16:26] <lizmat> thing is, that I do find the idea of an immutable Set as an attribute useful

[16:26] <jnthn> But then what if they call a private method to help with stuff, and the private method is also called from elsewhere, etc.

[16:26] <lizmat> I guess some dynamic variable being set ?

[16:27] <lizmat> in any case, things would need to be thought out here

[22:14] <sboss> I am looking for some information on Perl6 regex to match symbols like <, >, & / (for example).  I tried googling it but I have failed.

[22:15] <sboss> If someone could just point me in the right direction I would appreciate it

[22:15] <timotimo> sounds like you want "<", ">", "&", "/" for example

[22:15] <sboss> Yes

[22:16] <timotimo> yeah, that's literally all you need, just need to quote it

[22:16] <sboss> Kk thanks

[22:16] <timotimo> perl6 regex has the simple rule where symbols need to be escaped to match literally, and letters match literally

[22:19] <AlexDaniel> sboss: also https://docs.perl6.org/language/regexes#Predefined_character_classes

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘Hello <world>, this “is” a 'test'.’.match(/<punct>/)

[22:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 82fc4e570: OUTPUT: «｢,｣␤ punct => ｢,｣␤»
