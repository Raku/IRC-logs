[00:54] <Doc_Holliwood> united domains says raku.org is registered but for sale (1800 Euros)

[00:54] <timotimo> rakud.org

[00:54] <Doc_Holliwood> well it currently redirects to perl6.org

[00:55] <timotimo> what, raku.org?

[00:55] <Doc_Holliwood> so it makes sense to assume the owner might be here?

[00:55] <Doc_Holliwood> yes

[00:55] <timotimo> oh

[00:56] <Doc_Holliwood> why is there no .lang domain anyway?

[00:57] <Doc_Holliwood> raku.network is available, so it raku.help

[00:59] <lizmat> raku.org is mine

[01:00] <lizmat> where does united domains say that ?

[01:00] <Doc_Holliwood> https://www.united-domains.de

[01:00] <Doc_Holliwood> search for raku

[01:01] <timotimo> maybe if someone is willing to shell out the 1.8k they'll contact liz and ask her to pay 2k to keep it

[01:01] <Grinnz> could just be out of date

[01:01] <lizmat> too tired to look at that now...

[01:02] <lizmat> will look further into that tomorrow

[01:02] <lizmat> but it looks to me like their just outdated info, let some poor schmuck pay 1800 US$ and make 600 US$ in the process (because I bought it for 1200)

[01:03] <timotimo> oof

[01:04] <lizmat> it's a nice business model: scrape all domain sellers, add 50% on the price and sell it on your own site

[01:04] <lizmat> somebody orders with you, then they buy the domain at the original seller and make 50 profit

[01:04] <lizmat> 50%

[01:12] <Doc_Holliwood> i looked at ICANN and those are the guys with the say right?

[01:12] <Doc_Holliwood> there it says status: clientTransferProhibited

[01:13] <Doc_Holliwood> so, lizmat seems to be right, a reselling scam

[01:14] <lizmat> yeah, had that happen to us once: sold a domain we had for a long time for 1000 euro, only to find out the guy immediately sold it for 5000

[01:14] <lizmat> ok, I really need to get some sleep&

[01:35] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> That is to say, a small website that can be used to attract passerbys by being pretty

[01:36] <timotimo> rakudo.org is very pretty from a design standpoint, but probably not what you mean?

[01:37] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> I thought Rakudo was the compiler?

[11:58] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: Just found 'Community' Tab

[11:59] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: yeah, that ticket is about this page: https://perl6.org/community/irc

[11:59] <AlexDaniel> so it is sorta documented, but the ticket is more up-to-date

[12:00] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: I'll look at trying to update Community page. May be good to have a link in perl6 topic????

[12:01] <finanalyst> When is name change to be finalised? I saw Larry's agreement.

[12:01] <finanalyst> How will transition be managed, eg. namespaces, documentation, IRC channels etc

[12:02] <finanalyst> Will rakudo be an alias for perl6, then perl6 an alias for rakudo?

[12:02] <El_Che> finanalyst: there is a PR, and it will be expanded/complemented where necessary

[12:02] <El_Che> finanalyst: monday will be the day of the merge of no one opposes.

[12:05] <AlexDaniel> 2019-10-14T08:08:35Z it is, btw

[12:18] <finanalyst> El_Che: Just read the PR. Not quite sure on a couple of things. One is: I use perl6 in a terminal. When can I start using raku?

[12:19] <finanalyst> Will this be after .e or after next merge?

[12:19] <El_Che> finanalyst: if you use my Linux packagesn you already can for a long time :)

[12:20] <El_Che> but the build process needs to be changed indeed

[12:20] <finanalyst> just tried raku on my Ubuntu (I use latest rakudostar), and got raku not found

[12:22] <El_Che> finanalyst: yeah, I didn't mean star (which I don't use), but these: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#os-repositories

[12:23] *** satori__ joined
[12:23] <El_Che> finanalyst: but anyway, the renaming hasn't happened yet.

[12:23] <El_Che> finanalyst: I just added the raku alias when it was an... alias

[12:25] <finanalyst> El_Che: I'm beginning to be a bit more active in community. Slow period for a while. Rakudostar seemed the least painful way to update. What's good practice now?

[12:26] <finanalyst> Also I seem to have broken my perl6 compiler for documentation. Can't get --doc=HTML to work

[12:26] <El_Che> finanalyst: the easiest is the packages frim the distros theselves.

[12:27] <El_Che> but if you want the latest, I think compiling yourself or rakudo-pkg is the easiest

[12:27] <finanalyst> I'm considering reinstalling perl6. Should I wait til Monday for merge?

[12:27] <El_Che> finanalyst: no

[12:27] <El_Che> the merge will take some time

[12:27] <El_Che> I mean the changes it introduces

[12:28] <El_Che> I originally create the rakudo packages because I had a different use case than rakudo star

[12:28] <El_Che> 1. I don't want extra packages (I want to use it in containers), I want to install whatever I need with zef

[12:29] <El_Che> 2. I wanted precompiled packages in the format of my os

[12:29] <finanalyst> El_Che: which os do you run?

[12:30] <El_Che> Ubuntu (desktop, Server), alpine (server), CentOS (server)

[12:30] <El_Che> but I added other distros when people asked for it

[12:30] *** reach_satori_ joined
[12:30] <El_Che> like fedore, suse and so on

[12:30] <El_Che> s/e/a

[12:32] <finanalyst> El_Che: I use Ubuntu too. Very happy to see. How often do you update packages?

[12:32] <El_Che> finanalyst: with every rakudo release

[12:32] *** satori__ left
[12:33] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: sorry. i will, i looked at a few of the new commits and promptly forgot to continue

[12:33] <finanalyst> El_Che: FAB!!!!! I avoided packages with perl6 as I had some issues (very long time ago) with the packages being out of date

[12:33] <El_Che> finanalyst: I try to create packages rigth away at release time to see if something is broken

[12:34] <El_Che> finanalyst: if everything is ok, the packages are available just a few hours after release

[12:36] <finanalyst> El_Che: Great! Suppose I update using Ubuntu to a new release, say of rakudo. Do I need to run a zef update to recompile all modules?

[12:36] <finanalyst> I'm thinking that isn't necessary, but just checking

[12:37] <timotimo> rakudo updates precomp files by itself

[12:37] <El_Che> finanalyst: nothing fancy about the packages, just regular Rakudo. So the first time you use them the precomp stuff will happen if needed

[12:37] <timotimo> we still don't have anything that clears out precomp files that are no longer needed (or reachable) i believe?

[12:39] <finanalyst> I am looking at everything I can find about CompUnit. a) I think there should be some sort of tutorial page (b) I think the design of Pod::To::Cache needs to be changed

[14:47] <timotimo> libuv is most probably not in build-essentials

[14:47] <timotimo> and also not libatomic_ops

[14:48] <timotimo> they are things used in moarvm

[14:48] <timotimo> when moarvm is installed i think it also installs the header files for those libs in some place?

[14:48] <timotimo> i think?

[14:48] <finanalyst> timotimo: I've just installed -dev versions of these libraries and libtommath. How to provide info for future users?

[14:49] <timotimo> hmm. i *think* we no longer have custom patches in libtommath

[14:49] <timotimo> for a while there hadn't been a release with fixes that we required, but there has since been one

[14:50] <finanalyst> I installed rakudo using rakudo_pkg and then got these problems when installing modules with zef

[14:50] <timotimo> i'm not actually sure how exactly it's meant to be handled

[14:50] *** kensanata left
[14:50] <finanalyst> Linenoise and NativeHelpers::Blob generated the ld errors. 

[14:51] <timotimo> modules that build their own C stuff tend to take the config from moarvm, i.e. what paths were used for compilation and such

[14:51] <timotimo> that isn't really sensible for multiple reasons

[14:51] <timotimo> like when you use a moarvm that's been built with clang, but you only have gcc

[14:51] <timotimo> or when you're on windows and you don't have MSVC, but you have cygwin gcc or whatever

[14:51] <timotimo> i really don't know :(

[14:53] <finanalyst> zef stops processing other modules, not surprisingly. On Ubuntu, its a quick fix once the libraries are located, but finding what to do took a while without any information

[15:01] <timotimo> did it hide the output from ld?

[15:02] <timotimo> maybe modules should bundle a configure.sh with their stuff, but that's not a thing for windows :\

[15:02] <finanalyst> No the output was visible, but it took a while to find libatomic-ops-dev, not libatomic_ops-dev

[15:03] <finanalyst> I've solved the problem for myself, but I was wondering where I could put a troubleshooting note for others

[15:06] <finanalyst> perhaps a general note in a Trouble shooting page?? eg., if zef with an ld error look to install a lib<name>-dev library with the name from -l<name>. Maybe this seems a bit silly, but I've been tripped up by this a couple of times

[18:02] <finanalyst> the perl6 compiler is not working on my Ubuntu system as specified. I installed only rakudo. Then I used zef to install modules, including Pod::To::HTML. I ran `perl6 --doc=HTML somefilewithpod` . This generates the error 'no such method 'render' for invocant of type Pod::To::HTML. P2H module DOES have a multi sub render. 

[18:06] <timotimo> could be method vs sub

[18:07] <moritz> finanalyst: what version of rakudo did you install?

[18:07] <finanalyst> This is Rakudo version 2018.12 built on MoarVM version 2018.12

[18:07] <finanalyst> implementing Perl 6.d.

[18:07] <timotimo> ouch

[18:08] <finanalyst> When I installed perl6 using Rakudo Star, the invocation with --doc=HTML worked. 

[18:09] *** aborazmeh left
[18:09] <moritz> finanalyst: well, that's a pretty old rakudo, and "zef install" depends on the newest version of modules, which might or might not be compatible with old rakudo version

[18:09] <finanalyst> Then I was trying to understand a double call problem, so I deleted Pod::To::HTML and tried to reinstall it. But then the invocation with --doc=HTML failed

[18:10] <moritz> finanalyst: if you absolutely want/need such an old version of rakudo, I recommend to install Rakudo Star, because it bundles the modules that worked with the compiler back in the day of the release

[18:10] <finanalyst> So I completely deleted all instances of perl6 and zef, and reinstalled only perl6 and zef, then added other modules.

[18:35] <xinming_> something like,    class A { method a { "a".say }; method a-alias { self.a } }; A.new.a-alias;

[18:36] <xinming_> m: class A { method a { "a".say }; method a-alias { self.a } }; A.new.a-alias;

[18:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4df02facd: OUTPUT: «a␤»

[18:36] <xinming_> I feel it's a bit tedious here to write for method a-alias, What if there are several ones needs to be aliased?

[18:38] <SmokeMachine> xinming_: there is a module for tha

[18:53] <xinming_> after we changed perl6 to raku, What will module ext be?

[19:05] <timotimo> rakumod

[19:06] <xinming_> I mean the new  .pm6 ext

[19:07] <MasterDuke> finanalyst: fwiw, there's a known problem with Pod::To::HTML and/or new rakudos

[19:07] <xinming_> now we use .pm6,   In the future, Do we use  rk  or rak or rku

[19:08] <sena_kun> .rakumod for modules

[19:08] <xinming_> Ok, So, seems too long

[19:09] <finanalyst> MasterDuke: I'm trying to look into that problem. I just realised I had reinstalled the Ubuntu perl6 package, which is OUTOFDATE!!! Now installing the rakudo-pkg

[19:09] <sena_kun> if you are creating thousands of new module files everyday...

[19:09] <AlexDaniel> then script it!

[19:09] <sena_kun> yes. :)

[19:09] *** aborazmeh left
[19:10] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: what's the actual version of the out of date one?

[19:10] <sena_kun> I mean, even if you are typing by hands a single filename, 4 more letters (compared to .pm6) are how many fractions of second spent to type it?

[19:10] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: 2018.12

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> that's not bad at all

[19:11] <finanalyst> But I thought I had the latest one

[19:11] <finanalyst> Newer version seems to be installing modules much faster

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> that's probably true!

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> but overall 2018.12 is definitely usable

[19:13] <finanalyst> Also the rakudo-pkg has 'raku' as a binary :) So, I've started using it instead of perl6

[19:14] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: your packages are too good

[19:15] <finanalyst> xinming: I had a similar reaction early today when I read the PR about the change of name, viz., use of rakumod/rakudoc/ etc as extensions. But really the three letter extensions are too inflexible for a modern world. 

[19:15] <timotimo> let's make it .raku.mod then the extension is only three letters long

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> why

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> Foo.rakumod. 

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> better

[19:16] <timotimo> no, it makes the extension so much shorter

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> can't be shorter than zero, no?

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> :)

[19:16] <timotimo> oh!

[19:16] <timotimo> i didn't see the . there

[19:16] <timotimo> that's even smarter

[19:18] <moritz> but, BUT, what about DOS compatibility? </troll>

[19:18] <timotimo> rakum~1.

[19:21] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: or another one: .🦋 (that's one character, right? Right?!)

[19:22] <timotimo> let's look through combining characters and see if we find something nice

[19:22] <timotimo> for raku doc we require the user to strike-through every letter of the filename

[19:22] <timotimo> because nobody reads the docs anyway

[19:23] <AlexDaniel> xD

[19:24] <MasterDuke> ha

[19:30] <finanalyst> :)

[19:33] *** molaf left
[19:34] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: I just created a PR for Pod::To::HTML. It's a patch that allows perl6 --doc=HTML to work

[19:34] <finanalyst> but it seems a bit of a hack to me

[19:34] <Grinnz> just be glad with raku, the suggestions of dos compatibility are only trolling ;)

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: it does look like a hack :D

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> finanalyst: I'm surprised it works

[19:37] <finanalyst> AlexDaniel: It works for me locally, but I am wary of my set up at present. 

[19:38] <finanalyst> I'd like to know whether anyone else has problems generating HTML by invoking perl6 with --doc=HTML

[19:40] <MasterDuke> finanalyst: there was some conversation here a couple days ago and several other people had problems with `--doc=HTML` (myself included, i get the error you mentioned)

[19:40] *** leont joined
[19:41] <finanalyst> MasterDuke: I think I started the convo. Finally, got to look at it. I've hacked Pod::To:HTML to add a method that calls a sub. Then perl6 --doc=HTML works as advertised

[19:42] <finanalyst> MasterDuke: It seems that render is only called once!!! ????

[19:43] <MasterDuke> that whole codebase is unknown to me, but i thought there was some concerns about it being called twice?

[19:48] <sena_kun> yes

[19:48] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2588

[19:49] <finanalyst> MasterDuke: I'm trying to figure it out. But with the patch I just put in the PR for P2HTML, the 'render' method is only called once! Whereas for another arbitrary module, it is called twice 

[19:49] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, and it is even reproducible with Pod::To::Text...

[19:49] <finanalyst> Unless, I've misread the profiler report

[19:49] <MasterDuke> huh, odd

[19:52] <leont> Is there a clear description of for dependency versions are interpeted?

[19:54] <finanalyst> leont: sorry. "of for" is missing something. You talking about Pod::To::HTML?

[19:56] <leont> Nope, sorry for interrupting that conversation

[19:56] <leont> Is there a clear description of how version in dependencies in META6.json are interpreted?

[19:56] <leont> Would :ver(0.0.8+) match 0.1.0 or only 0.0.X?

[20:01] <moritz> m: say v0.1.0 ~~  v0.0.8+ 

[20:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4df02facd: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[20:01] <moritz> leont: I'm not certain, but I'd assume it'd just use the smart-match of the built-in Version objects

[20:02] <MasterDuke> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Version doesn't seem to answer that exact question, but gives some mechanisms for finding out (as moritz++ showed)

[20:03] <finanalyst> MasterDuke: still being called twice, but pod is only rendered once.

[21:06] <xinming_> Is there a flag to make .perl method pretty the output?

[21:07] <sena_kun> no

[21:07] <sena_kun> as it is a sub-question of a very complex question of "how to format Perl 6 code"

[21:08] <sena_kun> and people are giving different answers

[21:08] <xinming_> Ok. :-)

[21:08] <xinming_> I understand.
