[06:56] <discord6> <Aearnus> I didn't even know Perl 6 had windows support

[06:57] <jmerelo> Aearnus: it does have, and you can even install it using chocolatey. However, I'm not sure if paths are automatically translated (via IO::Path::Win32) or we need to explicitly create them that way.

[07:17] <Xliff> I don't think that feature is in, yet. Is the code on github?

[07:18] <El_Che> https://github.com/perl6/whateverable I think

[07:18] <Xliff> Ah.

[07:19] <jmerelo> Problem is, only way that I have to test Win32 stuff is to use Appveyor. Which is fine, but it takes time...

[08:56] <jmerelo> If anyone has a Windows machine handy, I'd be inmensely grateful if they downloaded https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached and run the tests

[08:56] <Xliff> jmerelo: I'd have to reboot.

[08:57] <Xliff> And do you want me to try native Windows or use the WSL?

[08:57] <jmerelo> I'm trying to come up with a "rm -rf" equivalent that works also in Windows, but I can't seem to get the path right.

[08:57] <Xliff> deltree?

[08:57] <jmerelo> Xliff: I didn't know that...

[08:57] <Xliff> :)

[08:57] <jmerelo> Xliff: anyhow, the command is rmdir /s /q, but the path does not seem to be correct...

[08:58] <El_Che> deltree

[08:58] <jmerelo> Xliff: deltree only works in Win10?

[08:58] <El_Che> oh Xliff was faster

[08:58] <Xliff> OK. Well I will reboot to Windows and attempt to install Pod-To-Cached

[08:58] <El_Che> jmerelo: I remember deltree from the DOS days

[08:58] <Xliff> El_Che: :)

[08:59] <jmerelo> I don't remember the DOS days

[08:59] <jmerelo> This is the thing: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JJ/pod-to-cached/builds/27169716

[08:59] <jmerelo> Now it's saying: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

[09:04] <jmerelo> deltree is not used now, apparently

[13:53] <timotimo> does "perl6" work in the console?

[13:55] <asd> C:\rakudo>perl6 hello.p6

[13:55] <asd> i think so

[13:56] <timotimo> i have no clue about the windows build of rakudo :(

[13:57] <tellable6> 2019-09-04T05:09:37Z #perl6 <jmerelo> Coke will check out the issue. Thanks.

[13:58] <asd> then perl6 is working does it?

[13:58] <[Coke]> ?

[13:59] <[Coke]> that looks like a command you run, not a message you get

[14:03] <[Coke]> you have a file "hello.p6" ?

[14:03] <[Coke]> no, I'm just verifying.

[14:04] <[Coke]> you can also try: perl6 -e "say 'hi'"

[14:04] *** daxim joined
[14:05] <[Coke]> you shouldn't have to be in any particular directory when you run perl6.

[17:13] <Grinnz> someone has written one that works

[17:13] <Grinnz> basically, just grabbing perlbrew from apt and going from there it looked like

[17:14] <jmerelo> Can you do that? It would be interesting to have one for Perl 6 too...

[17:14] <jmerelo> We've got the containers and everything.

[17:14] <Grinnz> i'm sure it could be doable in that way

[17:41] <perryprog> I'm having some trouble: why does my @lines = slurp("CONTRIBUTING.md") ==> split("\n") assign lines to a one elem list of the result of slurp? Perl ignores split unless I surround the RHS of the assignment with parens

[17:42] <perryprog> Hopefully that makes sense.

[17:42] <perryprog> Ah shoot, I didn't read the second part of the docs on the ==> operator. Never mind.

[18:27] <tobs> the bottom line to keep in mind is that ==> has extremely loose precedence, looser than assignment and even looser than `and` and `or`

[19:09] <varjack> what in the heck

[19:10] <thiccdaddy> wow a gist output, classy

[19:10] <varjack> was not expecting that, but your bot looks nice

[19:10] <Grinnz> cute, but not how irc works, even if any of the bots were opped

[19:11] <varjack> depends on how the bot interacts with the channel, but in most cases yes

[19:11] <Grinnz> maybe if it's a mirc bot, but i try to put those out of my mind

[19:12] <varjack> I think I've only ever gotten that to work on an mirc bot

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> you should `use IRC::Client`, then set up the client and connect to freenode

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> *with* your password :P :P

[19:31] <AlexDaniel> and then you can op anyone from the bot on the channels that you own :P :P :P
