[00:27] <elcaro> What's the recommneded way to re-build HEAD these days. I had an alias set up for years that used to work all the time: -

[00:27] <elcaro> git pull && perl Configure.pl --gen-moar --gen-nqp --backends=moar --prefix=/usr/tools/perl6 && make && make install && make clean

[00:28] <elcaro> but ever since the builds were modified (i guess to make them reproducable) the above alias fails sometimes

[00:28] <elcaro> I think mainly after a Moar bump

[00:29] <elcaro> when it fails I'll get a failure in NQP/Config.pm complaining that moar is too old

[00:29] <elcaro> the old build system would update moar when it found the version was too old.

[00:38] <vrurg> elcaro: please, use #raku, this channel is deprecated now.

[00:42] <moon_child> vrurg: yet, this channel still has nearly 3x the user count

[00:56] <vrurg> moon_child: a) this is wrong b) in either case today #raku had much higher activity.

[00:56] <vrurg> and c) the higher number of users doesn't make this channel official anyway.

[01:41] <Doc_Holliwood> yeah i was looking at the ticket, trying to figure out how to add "blocker" as an alias for "update"

[01:42] <AlexDaniel> like

[01:42] <Doc_Holliwood> i couldn't find where the lookup takes place, suspected deep magic

[01:42] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, It looks like a URL, but mime type is ‘text/html; charset=utf-8’ while I was expecting something with ‘text/plain’ or ‘perl’ in it. I can only understand raw links, sorry.

[01:42] <Doc_Holliwood> now i realize those are all aliases

[01:43] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: yep, it's a common pattern in most *able6 bots. If it's possible to use other information instead of the command, the code does so

[01:43] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: it helps, I've spent a lot of time making sure that bots DWIM when people use the wrong command

[01:43] <AlexDaniel> because people never use the right one :)

[01:44] <AlexDaniel> for example

[01:44] <AlexDaniel> relesable6: help

[01:44] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, status | status link # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Releasable

[01:44] <AlexDaniel> ok that might be a bit over the top, but it did work :)

[01:44] <AlexDaniel> so all bots autocorrect their names

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> because once someone didn't spell right the name of bisectable6 three times in a row

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> and gave up after that :D

[01:45] <Doc_Holliwood> rlsble: when

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> yeah, the acceptable distance can't be too large because as you can see they start to clash with other things

[01:47] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to Doc_Holliwood

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> it attempt to use normalization before falling back to did-you-mean :)

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> attempts*

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: so it's not that much of a facepalm, really, it's just how forgiving the bots are :)

[01:52] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to Doc_Holliwood

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> no command required

[01:52] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to Doc_Holliwood

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> also works

[01:53] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to Doc_Holliwood

[01:53] <AlexDaniel> :)

[01:54] <AlexDaniel> it's not perfect though, I've seen people start their message with “please” more than once

[01:55] <AlexDaniel> and I see no reason not to add that, maybe when I have a bit more time :)

[01:56] <AlexDaniel> they already understand some stuff, you can say for example: thank you very much, tellable6!

[01:56] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, It's my pleasure!

[01:59] <Doc_Holliwood> I take it the whole thing than reliable whenever/react semantics? Older than Cro?

[02:02] <AlexDaniel> there was no IRC::Client too, the first version was in perl5

[02:02] <AlexDaniel> there was just bisectable, and very shortly MasterDuke++ contributed committable6

[02:02] <AlexDaniel> which was pretty much just a copy of bisectable with some tweaks

[02:03] <AlexDaniel> how it turned into 18 bots (19 next week, I think) I can't remember :D

[02:04] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: if you see anything that can be written better with react/whenever, please do

[02:05] <AlexDaniel> I mean, please do rewrite it, or at least tell me what to do :)

[02:06] <Doc_Holliwood> They probably had bot sex when you weren't looking

[02:08] <Doc_Holliwood> And if you find that amusing  because bot sex sounds a bit like butt sex then you're a pig and should be ashamed of yourself

[02:08] <Doc_Holliwood> ^^

[02:09] <AlexDaniel> they can do what they want, I don't discriminate!
