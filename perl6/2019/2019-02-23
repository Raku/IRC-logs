[02:48] <hahainternet> thanks for the post timotimo, i'm working on things kinda unrelated to perl6 but it's always nice to read strategies, especially when i don't understand the problem domain :)

[02:53] <timotimo> :D

[02:53] <timotimo> i need to finally write up something for my SDL2 experiments, even though they are still super simple

[02:57] *** ayerhart left
[02:58] <hahainternet> i am trying to concieve of a grammar that describes itself increasingly accurately while it is iteratively being designed

[02:58] *** ayerhart joined
[02:59] <timotimo> not entirely sure how you mean that? like invent a new EBNF-like?

[03:00] <hahainternet> more or less, but designed around more human language

[03:00] <hahainternet> EBNF is exactly accurate/precise immediately

[03:00] <hahainternet> but humans describe things in big gloopy messes

[03:00] <timotimo> that's true

[03:00] <hahainternet> i'm intrigued by the idea of taking an abstract description, diving down and formalising each segment, then stepping backwards and genericising the formalised version

[03:00] <hahainternet> and seeing what you get

[03:01] <timotimo> at some point we should have the other way around: put in perl6 grammar, get out a human-readable description :)

[03:01] <hahainternet> well, all my playing is done in p6 because grammars are so wonderful

[03:01] <hahainternet> it's not so much human readable, but the ideal confluence

[03:01] <hahainternet> human writeable, machine readable, human rewriteable

[03:02] <timotimo> mhm

[03:02] <timotimo> that makes sense, yeah

[03:02] <hahainternet> currently slowly tackling Syntactical Structures

[03:02] <hahainternet> (in PDF format, gah)

[03:04] <hahainternet> ah excellent and the guy i was arguing with on reddit was basically entirely arguing a red herring

[03:04] <hahainternet> wonderful :)

[03:04] <timotimo> ;(

[03:05] <hahainternet> my fault too, the thread will be informative for passers by though, which is ideal

[03:05] <timotimo> yeah, there's often many more of them than the people actually involved

[03:10] <hahainternet> anyhow, half of what i am doing already looks perl6y because it's like "class Pump { has Inlet; has Outlet; }" etc

[03:10] <hahainternet> a linguistic approach really feels right

[03:10] <discord6> <Rogue> I love "has" for class members

[03:10] <hahainternet> 'is' and 'does' too

[03:10] *** zachk left
[03:11] <discord6> <Rogue> After all, programming languages other than machine code are for humans

[03:11] <hahainternet> that's not entirely true imho

[03:11] <hahainternet> we don't have any programming languages truly for humans, just ones that are more humanistic than others

[03:11] <discord6> <Rogue> Well, okay, programming languages are for programmers

[03:12] <hahainternet> hah are you suggesting we are all part machine? ;)

[03:12] <discord6> <Rogue> and what do you get taught in any OO-focused introductory programming course? Object A has object B

[14:07] <chee> is there a way using the `sub MAIN` for command line args, to say that the single letter args are able to be passed all together?

[14:07] <chee> like in `wc -lwc` i mean

[14:09] <timotimo> interesting, https://github.com/tadzik/Getopt-Type does seem to support that

[14:09] <timotimo> it hasn't been updated in years, though

[14:09] <chee> i've specified them all as optional, like `sub MAIN (Bool :$l, Bool :$w) {}` but then they need to be passed `wc -l -w`

[14:09] <timotimo> and there's now ways to customize parts of sub MAIN directly

[14:10] <El_Che> There is also leont's https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Getopt::Long:cpan:LEONT

[14:10] <El_Che> if you like the perl5 like functionality

[14:10] <chee> i was hoping it would be a `%SUB-MAIN-OPTS` value, but there's only one of those ^_^ 

[14:12] <El_Che> chee: lizmat added that after I complained about the functionality here, so you know how things get into core :)

[14:12] <chee> El_Che: :D

[14:13] <chee> maybe i should come back and complain again at a more carefully planned time

[14:13] <El_Che> that's the spirit

[14:27] *** manchicken joined
[14:33] <chee> would i use a META6.json in the root directory of an app also, is that a sensible thing to do? or is there another process for keeping track of dependencies when you aren't going to be distributing the thing as a library

[14:34] *** xinming joined
[14:38] <moritz> chee: that's sensible for applications too

[14:38] <El_Che> it's even probably the only wya

[14:38] <El_Che> way

[14:38] <El_Che> (isn't it?)

[14:39] <moritz> well, you could have a shell script with "zef install" lines

[14:39] *** volkov joined
[14:40] <El_Che> moritz: I don't like you anymore

[14:40] <chee> i could copy all my dependencies into the directory and run it as `perl6 -I.`

[14:40] <chee> there are all sorts of terrible things we can do !

[14:41] <El_Che> thin ice, mister/missy

[14:41] <volkov> So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl6 script.
