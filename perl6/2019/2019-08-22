[00:00] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: Is SVG good enough? BTW, timotimo works on a game already.

[00:00] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: seems great

[00:01] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: actually, check with modules.perl6.org. For example: https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=plot

[00:02] <aearnus[m]> i'm taking a look. if timo released his cairo bindings those would work

[00:02] <aearnus[m]> oh, he did

[00:02] <aearnus[m]> :D

[00:07] <Doc_Holliwood> how very much prettier Perl 6 is, you can really see in direct comparison: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57592117/compare-two-strings-and-find-mismatch-and-match-and-count-them-both-in-perl/57600097#57600097

[00:09] <aearnus[m]> Doc_Holliwood: fwiw, `@strings.comb` is a nicer way to write `@strings.map: *.split('', :skip-empty)`

[00:09] <aearnus[m]> ** @strings.map: .comb

[00:10] <aearnus[m]> m: my @s = <hello world>; ([Z] @s>>.comb).say

[00:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: ¬´((h w) (e o) (l r) (l l) (o d))‚ê§¬ª

[00:13] *** dominix_ is now known as dominix

[00:15] <dominix> AlexDaniel: sorry, I was away, ClearLinux has support for snap or flatpak, but no rpm nor deb

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> rba: but then, evalable6 also has a few brain cells :)

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> rba: for example

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> say 42

[00:15] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar cd8463a85: OUTPUT: ¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[00:15] <AlexDaniel> how did it know? ;)

[00:16] <aearnus[m]> say, I wonder...

[00:16] <AlexDaniel> :P

[00:17] <aearnus[m]> (ahh, I thought I could trick it)

[00:18] *** god joined
[00:21] <aearnus[m]> aha................. so, it looks at nonalphawhitespace characters

[00:21] <vrurg> say if True ??

[00:21] <vrurg> say if True

[00:21] <vrurg> But it's a valid thing! 

[00:21] <aearnus[m]> ohh, I see. it throws out bad requests if it doesn't see the prefix

[00:22] <aearnus[m]> vrurg: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/master/xbin/Evalable.p6#L46

[00:22] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: cheating? Looking at the last page? :p

[00:23] <aearnus[m]> hehe, it's not cheating if the book of answers is splayed out in front of me :p

[00:24] *** cpup left
[00:24] *** cpup joined
[00:29] <AlexDaniel> aearnus[m]: that thing only checks if the message is more wordy than symboly

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> aearnus[m]: if it is, then it's unlikely to be code, so it doesn't bother

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> .say if True

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> say ‚Äòx‚Äô if True

[00:29] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar cd8463a85: OUTPUT: ¬´x‚ê§¬ª

[00:30] <AlexDaniel> aearnus[m]: but TL;DR it executes every message and looks at the output, if it's kinda clean then it replies

[00:31] *** pamplemousse left
[00:32] <AlexDaniel> that's the magic: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/blob/9d16c7cd3789aff5a9df233933e4e31a9c00be48/xbin/Evalable.p6#L71-L79

[00:34] <AlexDaniel> that if doesn't make much sense to me, actually

[00:37] <aearnus[m]> "forcefully proceed with non-zero signals"

[00:37] <aearnus[m]> allows zero signals

[00:40] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure what did I even mean

[00:41] <AlexDaniel> ahhh actually it's right?

[00:41] <AlexDaniel> so if it's sighup, then'll it'll return

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> if it's zero, then it depends on other rules

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> if it's segfault, then it won't go into that block

[00:42] <AlexDaniel> I think it's right. Should I participate in code obfuscation contest? :D

[10:08] *** sortiz left
[10:11] <cono> I was expecting nextsame, actually uses values after multi dispatch

[10:26] <jnthn> nextsame iterates through a pre-determined candidate list (based on the original arguments). 

[10:27] <jnthn> (As does nextwith, etc.)

[10:27] <jnthn> If you want to redispatch, use samewith

[10:30] <cono> yeah, I understand, but problem here is not in the list of next candidates. problem that default value for :$x not accounted when I do nextsame but does if I do nextwith and explicitly specify :$x

[10:30] *** nepugia left
[10:30] *** vike1 left
[10:32] <jnthn> Ah, yes, that's unsurprising also, because nextsame uses the argument capture that was originally passed (which is immutable)

[10:32] <jnthn> $x is just a variable bound to something from that capture

[10:33] <jnthn> Binding an alternative value to that variable is a method-local action; it doesn't have any impact on the underlying argument capture

[14:03] <scimon> Functions! For the win!

[14:05] <kawaii> I always feel bad looking at code from even just a few weeks ago :(

[14:05] *** dolmen joined
[14:05] <scimon> Well I either feel bad or confused ;)

[14:05] <scimon> Don't worry. This is normal. Coding is about packing a complex problem into your head and holding it there long enough to put it on the computer.

[14:06] <scimon> And then it wanders off. It's like Wizards spells in D&D. If you want to do it again you have to get your head in the same space.

[14:07] <sena_kun> kawaii, no need to feel bad, it happens. Though the fact that it happens does not justify an absence of prettifying afterwards, of course.

[14:10] <kawaii> sena_kun: you and jnthn write really elegant looking programs and it makes mere mortals like me feel bad :P

[14:11] * sena_kun blushes

[14:11] <scimon> It takes time and practice. (If you want to feel better about your code feel free to take a look at mine ;) )

[14:12] <scimon> I still write very Perl5y Perl6.

[14:12] <vrurg> scimon: I hope you dont 'use Moose'? :p

[14:12] <scimon> Not... THAT bad.

[14:13] <scimon> But I still use () where : could work instead.

[14:14] *** dolmen left
[14:14] <kawaii> I tried to write Perl 5 once and gave up because I couldn't use a hyphen in a variable name.

[14:15] <scimon> Ah well I think I'm a bit older. This whole kebab case thing is both cool and slightly weird.

[14:15] <scimon> (I didn't write Perl4 but I have written a lot of Perl5. Not all us Perl5 geezers dislike new things).

[14:15] <kawaii> I'm only 25 which I think makes me one of the younger Perl 6 users. :)

[14:16] <Grinnz> as a perl 5 user, hyphen not being valid in identifiers was a mistake IMO

[14:16] <scimon> It's awesome. And frankly it's what we need. Sure convincing a bunch of middle aged peeps to change their minds would be neat but seeing new people picking it up is awesome.

[14:17] <scimon> I remember when I read Learning Perl (would have been 28 or so) and it was the first programming language I really grokked.

[14:17] <Grinnz> but I am pretty sure the "word character" set which excludes hyphens did not originate with perl

[14:18] <Grinnz> I'm going to blame POSIX like for most things :P

[14:18] <scimon> Sounds like a plan.

[14:18] <scimon> (I think it's a C thing and probably before that).

[15:42] <SmokeMachine> scimon: wouldn't that be "1d10 - 1"?

[15:42] <scimon> Yes but you roll up to 4. 1 or more need to equal or beat a target number (so similar to WoD games). With some added stuff.

[15:43] <scimon> Oh and for 3 of the 4 potential dice (which you get through magic) a 0 makes weird stuff happen.

[15:43] <scimon> (But not the first dice).

[15:44] <scimon> I have this kinda crazy idea to basically have a dice rolling module that covers every game I can with a parser as well. 

[15:44] <scimon> Because I need to relax somehow.

[15:46] <SmokeMachine> scimon: will it can return a boolean, for example "run 3d6 and it's true if at least 2 of them are higher than 3"

[15:47] <SmokeMachine> scimon: and it roll the dices and return a boolean?

[15:49] <scimon> Yeah I want to be able to do something like parse("3d6 vs 10").Str and get "Rolled 13. Success"

[15:49] <scimon> While .Bool gives True (in this case)

[15:49] <scimon> :D

[15:50] <scimon> But some games you total the roll. Others it's individual dice (and some like the new Star Wars are *really* weird).

[15:51] <SmokeMachine> "3d6 vs 2x3" for "run 3d6 and it's true if at least 2 of them are higher than 3"?

[15:52] <scimon> something like that.

[15:52] <SmokeMachine> scimon: interesting...

[15:53] <scimon> Vampire is dice pool vs target and generally you need 1 success but more is good.

[15:53] <scimon> But there's lot. Star Wars has it's own dice and you make a pool of different dice. It interesting because you can succeed but have bad stuff happen.

[15:54] <scimon> Or fil but have good stuff.

[15:54] <scimon> Or fail but have good stuff.

[15:54] <scimon> Even

[16:11] <lucasb> will keep at least one core developer from leaving the project?

[16:12] <tadzik> that's what it says, yes ;)

[16:14] <lucasb> FTR, I think #81 and #89 are absurd. I'm not OK with they being kept open.

[16:17] <tadzik> I think #81 is open for your concerns

[16:25] *** dakkar left
[16:25] <lucasb> I don't think I would be able to put into better words what others have already said, so I would bringing nothing new to the discussion. I'm just expressing my feelings here on the channel, if that's ok. :)

[16:27] *** scimon left
[16:27] <tadzik> heh, having been opposed to the idea too, I wrote down my thoughts in #81 and was frustrated at the "silent agreement" that some have expressed

[16:28] <tadzik> "I've read what you said and I agree!", the would say. But without them saying it themselves on github it makes it seem like nobody ‚Äì except me ‚Äì has the same concerns

[16:29] <tadzik> so I'd say: even if you'd just repeat somebody else's points, please do so, if you can take the time

[16:29] <Grinnz> the reactions were helpful for that. it's unfortunate that it's not possible to allow reactions without allowing more peanut gallery

[16:29] <tadzik> then again, I think at this point the case is basically closed and the issues is resolved

[16:29] <lucasb> tadzik: ah, ok. I think understand what you said. FTR, I *totally* agree with your comment there. 

[16:30] <tadzik> Grinnz: they kind of fill that need, yes, but I think that the magnitude of how much nobody cares about emoji reactions can only be matched by how much I hate them personally :P

[16:30] <lucasb> By "case is closed and issue is resolved", do you mean the renaming will happen?

[16:30] <tadzik> lucasb: I think so, ye

[16:31] <Grinnz> I think it's a very useful indicator

[16:31] <lucasb> 100 thumbs-up against 1 thumbs-down? I don't think those reactions mean much, lol. Isn't they all P5 people?

[16:31] <Grinnz> it's not a vote, only the 13 mentioned people have that, but it's a piece of the difficult "what does the community think" puzzle

[16:32] <Grinnz> they certainly are not.

[16:32] <tadzik> I feel like because of how easy they are to make ‚Äì and how kinda-anonymous they are (who's checking each individual reaction before they decide if they're legit or not?") ‚Äì bound them to total worthlessness

[16:33] <tadzik> in a closed, curated community they may have been a useful indicator

[16:33] <Grinnz> it's as useful as any statistics, really

[16:34] <Grinnz> in a closed, curated community they would only be useful if you want to know what the closed, curated community thinks

[16:35] <Grinnz> another word for that is echo chamber

[16:35] <Grinnz> (phrase?)

[16:35] <tadzik> yeah, fair enough

[16:36] <tadzik> I guess what I meant to say is: a proper, well-worded comment is worth 1000 winky faces

[16:36] <lucasb> tadzik++

[16:37] <lucasb> GH is social media. I care about the opinion of the core developers, not about the outside community

[16:37] <AlexDaniel> peanut gallery xD

[16:37] <tadzik> I'm not a big fan of echochambers, but on the other hand I don't see much value in a contribution of dozens of people who don't really give a shit about the project all the issue, but if they can hop in and click a single button to vote for something random, they will

[16:37] <tadzik> it's like internet petitions really

[16:37] *** ravenousmoose joined
[16:38] <tadzik> everyone can join in, the cost of signing is close to zero, so why not have your internet bandwagon make it seem like something is a popular idea?

[16:38] <Grinnz> lucasb: well, several core developers opinions are in that issue as well

[16:38] <Grinnz> including the opening comments ;)

[16:39] <AlexDaniel> tadzik: honestly, I'm not sure if a comment is worth much. There are more than 200 comments, absorbing them all is kinda difficult

[16:39] <lucasb> as I said, there are NO consensus among them

[16:39] <Grinnz> there is not. and until there is, one way or another, this issue will reappear

[16:39] <tadzik> AlexDaniel: that's true ‚Äì and the discussion got a bit... distracted at times, making it even harder

[16:40] <tadzik> still, if you were to substitute them all with an aggregation of emoji reacions, you'll get *none* of their value rather than a sample of it, imo

[16:42] <AlexDaniel> all that doesn't matter anyway

[16:42] <tadzik> but it's perhaps reasonable to take what I say with a grain of salt, since I just hate emojis *so much

[16:42] *** ravenousmoose left
[16:42] <AlexDaniel> there are 13 reviewers, and they'll decide

[16:43] *** antoniogamiz left
[16:43] <lucasb> how long will that take? I think we'll be in agony until everything's resolved

[16:43] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: as for keeping them open, #81 is a valid problem so even if #89 won't go through, I believe #81 will stay open

[16:44] <AlexDaniel> and again, reviewers will decide if #89 should be accepted or rejected

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: who's in agony? :)

[16:45] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: a few weeks

[16:45] <tadzik> the ones who hope for one outcome but expect another, I feel :)

[16:46] *** chloekek joined
[16:49] <AlexDaniel> so who's really hoping that Perl¬†6 will remain ‚ÄúPerl¬†6‚Äù?

[16:49] <lucasb> \o/

[16:50] <AlexDaniel> that's‚Ä¶ two hands

[16:50] <tadzik> o/

[16:50] <tadzik> but I've moved on to the 5th stage of grief already :P

[16:51] <tadzik> and am utimately hopeful for the future

[16:51] <lucasb> I hope moritz, masak, ugexe, nine and other fellows will be more eloquent than I'm, because I'm really starting to worry about the renaming.

[16:52] <lucasb> *sorry* to directly request for your opinion, but I wish this problem would settle earlier.

[16:54] <gdonald> what sort of concurrency would work best for console I/O?  for example a non-blocking console game

[16:56] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: it's actually the right thing to do, I think. If you're not on the list then talking to reviewers is a good approach

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> gdonald: hmm I'm not sure, terminal stuff can be difficult sometimes

[16:57] <AlexDaniel> gdonald: anything specific you're going to use? Or are you planning to read straight from stdin?

[16:59] <gdonald> I want to do keyboard input while also redrawing the screen, in a non-blocking manner

[16:59] <gdonald> I'm reading from tty, with some stty params to do one char at a time

[16:59] <gdonald> that works

[16:59] <gdonald> but I'm blocking my draw code :(

[17:01] <AlexDaniel> gdonald: something like this? https://github.com/RGVID-EU/RoboRG-Middleware/blob/1f20ba99ebdb1af4268190b8070e8995ca6510c2/visuals.p6#L63-L64

[17:02] <AlexDaniel> it's maybe a bit too simple but it does work

[17:02] <gdonald> thanks, I was actually thinking to try a Channel next.

[18:42] * [Coke] wonders what the most sixish way of saying "does anything in this list contain any fragments from this other list" is.

[18:43] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: set intersection?

[18:43] <AlexDaniel> or what do you mean by fragments?

[18:45] <chloekek> any(@xs) ‚äÜ @ys

[18:45] <[Coke]> @data.first({my $i=$_; @fragments.grep({$i.contains: $_})})

[18:46] <[Coke]> so, if I want to scan through email addresses and find anything with 'coleda.com' in it, e.g. 

[18:46] <[Coke]> @data.first({my $i=$_; @fragments.first({$i.contains: $_})})

[19:36] <El_Che> The SWOT is a reall waste of time

[19:37] <El_Che> so subjective that's it's useless

[19:37] <El_Che> we're all guessing

[19:37] <chloekek> Will the P and 6 in Camelia‚Äôs wings remain? :D

[19:37] <El_Che> chloekek: yes

[19:37] <chloekek> yay

[19:38] <El_Che> (however I would prefer to get rid of the mascotte, by far the worst I've seen)

[19:38] <Grinnz> El_Che: it's a very managerial thing to do... but it does lay out some things

[19:38] <El_Che> and by far, I mean very by far

[19:39] <El_Che> I seen many in a business setting, mostly bullshit :)

[19:39] <El_Che> I you are for something make a good proposal

[19:39] <El_Che> if

[19:39] <El_Che> if you're against, make a counterproposal

[19:40] <El_Che> what's a risc for someone is an opportuity for an other

[19:40] <Grinnz> the problem is that the only opposition I have seen is with the counterproposal of do nothing and pretend there are no problems.

[19:40] <El_Che> same for weakness and strenght

[19:40] <uzl[m]> chloekek: It's so much of an easter egg that I think most people miss it. I myself didn't notice the first time I saw Camelia.

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: feel free to start a new problem-solving issue about that. And good luck!

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> looks like we're not touching camelia as part of the rename, and that's for the better

[19:42] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: yeah, that's what we need :)

[19:42] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I am for not changing it

[19:42] <El_Che> while I hate it

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> good. Next topic please :D

[19:43] <El_Che> becasue it's not fundamental to me

[19:43] <El_Che> it's crap marketing, that's all

[19:43] <El_Che> I'll end with this: even children hate it :)

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: have they seen the plush version?

[19:44] <El_Che> yes

[19:44] <El_Che> it's an infantalized version of what an adult think children like

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> but dunno, golang has retarded turd as a mascot, seems to be working fine for them

[19:44] <El_Che> anyway, enough ranting

[19:44] <El_Che> it's retarded all right

[19:44] <El_Che> but not that retarded

[19:44] <El_Che> it a simple form

[19:45] <El_Che> we're are a overly complex...

[19:45] <El_Che> oh no

[19:45] <El_Che> :)

[19:45] <Grinnz> I honestly didn't know what their mascot was until just now... and yeah that is not great

[19:45] <El_Che> too much metaphores here :)

[19:53] <aearnus[m]> uzl (@uzluisf:matrix.org): my thought for a Raku logo was to exploit the fact that R A K U looks really pretty when arranged in a square

[19:53] <El_Che> 60's tie

[19:54] <AlexDaniel`> someone should really make a badass version of camelia

[19:54] <uzl[m]> Yeah, probably more like a lava lamp.

[19:54] <AlexDaniel`> I'll even agree to have it on the front page of perl6.org

[19:54] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: a reimagining? that would be great. A variation? meh

[19:55] <uzl[m]> It's supposed to be a vase though.

[19:55] <El_Che> on the other hand if even google with all its moneys can't get a proper mascot...

[19:55] <Grinnz> Zoffix made a really nice butterfly for one of those announcements

[19:55] <El_Che> uzl[m]: if course, we're half winding you up

[19:56] <rba> Personally I like the analogy of broken pottery. Yet it should not be confused with the art ot the pottery creating process.

[19:56] <El_Che> I think AlexDaniel had a good point about no associating to much to pottery, were there may be trademarks

[19:56] <uzl[m]> aearnus: Do you mean just the letters?

[19:57] <aearnus[m]> Yeah. Just as far as doing something typographically with them

[19:57] <aearnus[m]> As far as the rest of the contents of the logo, /shrug

[19:57] <El_Che> you need to find an explanation for the 

[19:58] <El_Che> backronym

[19:58] <rba> Grinnz: one published on https://marketing.perl6.org

[19:58] <El_Che> Oh "raku"? It's an ancient word in a Japanese dialect meaning "not Perl 5"

[19:58] <Grinnz> the one under brochures, yes

[19:59] <El_Che> ok, it may be the colours also: this is probably one of the best I've seen https://marketing.perl6.org/asset/pics/logo.png

[19:59] <Grinnz> it also looks very artistically cromulent with raku, but that's just my view

[19:59] <El_Che> not being a fan, but not extremely repulsed

[19:59] <uzl[m]> aearnus: Oh, I see. I think something like that could look nice.

[19:59] *** nepugia joined
[20:00] <aearnus[m]> :)

[20:01] <uzl[m]> Grinnz: I submitted a variant with softer colors and what I consider a more inviting smile (sorry, Larry ;-))

[20:01] <uzl[m]> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22332927/54382212-e8a0bc00-4665-11e9-9200-8e3188f94a05.png

[20:02] <El_Che> uzl[m]: it's better. The pink is still very bright though

[20:02] <El_Che> it could be a 80s tshirt

[20:03] <Grinnz> at the risk of overstepping what my opinion is worth on this matter, yes the smile is much better on that one

[20:04] <rba> In general I like ‚Äûthe butterfly‚Äú as symbol for the language. As it‚Äòs a second life for a creature. 

[20:04] <uzl[m]> Let's rock the 80s :-)!

[20:04] <El_Che> rba: as a metaphore, sure.

[20:04] <El_Che> and I *love* butterflies

[20:04] <rba> And some bools choose really beautiful ones on there cover. 

[20:04] <El_Che> please no jokes about the butterfly effect :)

[20:05] <Grinnz> camelia reminds me more of those moths with eyes on their wings. just saying :P

[20:06] <rba> https://perl6book.com

[20:11] *** pmurias left
[20:12] <uzl[m]> Yeah, the book covers look great.

[20:12] <uzl[m]> Literal eyes? Or just the illusion of eyes to scare predators away?

[20:13] <Grinnz> haha, I don't think there's any with actual eyes on their wings

[20:13] *** pmurias joined
[20:14] <chloekek> Or a raptor holding a Swiss Army magic wand

[20:16] *** pamplemousse left
[20:19] <uzl[m]> Grinnz: My imagination was already running wild. Their wings are too flimsy and don't have any tissue but could it be possible though?

[20:20] <uzl[m]> chloekek: I think Perl 5 has also a raptor as its logo. Or so I've read.

[20:20] <Grinnz> yes, unlike the camel, it is owned by the community

[20:20] <Grinnz> so it's useful there

[20:20] <El_Che> raptor perl

[20:21] <aearnus[m]> Why not a moth? https://images.app.goo.gl/okGRJ7uCrUAqPTRV9

[20:21] <chloekek> http://www.markkeating.me.uk/2011/02/25/raptor-with-a-swiss-army-chainsaw/

[20:35] <rba> The raptor is strongly associated with Perl 5.

[20:37] *** kensanata joined
[20:38] <rba> The swiss army knive might violate some rights of Victorinox. The company who produces them.

[20:39] <rba> I like the caterpillar, yet then you assume that Perl 6 is grown out of NQP.

[20:40] <aearnus[m]> Could do something reminiscent of a Swiss army knife. The multitool is kinda an overdone trope for technologies, but there are plenty of things that have multiple functionalities

[20:40] <aearnus[m]> Y'know what's versatile? The brick. Perl 6 bricks :p

[21:18] *** chloekek left
[21:25] <AlexDaniel> rba: then maybe alpine?

[21:26] <AlexDaniel> or, well‚Ä¶ what do you mean by dockerizing

[21:26] <AlexDaniel> you want to use rakudo in docker and you're deciding on your host os?

[21:27] <AlexDaniel> or?

[21:28] *** cpan-p6 left
[21:29] *** cpan-p6 joined
[21:29] *** cpan-p6 left
[21:29] *** cpan-p6 joined
[21:29] <rba> rakudo in docker (+Perl 5 + a bunch of CPAN modules)

[21:29] <rba> + NGINX

[21:30] <rba> I think Apline Linux is a lightweight OS and fits well into a docker container...

[21:32] <AlexDaniel> yeah, Alpine is one of the favorites :)

[21:52] <woolfy1> I was curious how discussions would go.  Apparently, as low as this... "The SWOT is a reall waste of time" and ""so subjective that's it's useless", and nobody protested against it, and it was not nuanced.  Nice insult to lizmat.

[21:52] <tellable6> 2019-08-21T22:00:02Z #perl6 <El_Che> woolfy1: Grinnz has been very polite and constructive, I don't think conflict is needed

[21:52] <tellable6> 2019-08-21T23:47:04Z #perl6 <AlexDaniel> woolfy: thank you for your work!

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> meh, I don't know. People asked about risks and got SWOT

[21:53] <woolfy1> Also as low as this, regarding the Perl 6 mascotte Camelia: "it's crap marketing, that's all", and "I'll end with this: even children hate it :)" and about the stuffed toy: "it's an infantalized version of what an adult think children like".

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> useless or not, that's what people were interested in, so there we go

[21:54] <woolfy1> I've spent 11 months on getting that infantalized version of Camelia, I paid to have a thousand copies made, it was of the few times I saw Larry being so emotional he was close to crying when he got the first copy.

[21:55] <woolfy1> I've been sent dozens of pictures of children (ranging from toddlers to teenagers, boys and girls) sleeping and/or cuddling their Camelia stuffed toy, by proud parents who got / bought one from me.

[21:56] <rba> woolfy1: My 7 years old daught *loves* the Camelia stuff toy you made and sleeps with it every night.

[21:56] <rba> s/daught/daughter/

[21:56] <woolfy1> Quite some people who won the Squashathon got one from me and sent me a emotional thank you when I sent them their prize Camelia stuffed toy: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5507503/46286803-2f539b80-c589-11e8-8d21-c04336a62cb4.png

[21:57] <woolfy1> So I get it, it's a f**king "infantalized version of what an adult think children like, and nobody protested here against that.

[21:57] <woolfy1> Sorry rba, not getting there...

[21:58] <woolfy1> I mean, it does not reach my furious mind.

[21:59] <woolfy1> AlexDaniel: a SWOT analysis is a way to define what the risks are of renaming Perl 6 to whatever.  If you know a better way than such a waste of time, something so subjective that it is useless, and you did not protest against those words, well, please, think of something more useful and less ubjective.

[21:59] * rba cares about woolfy1‚Äòs blood pressure

[21:59] <woolfy1> I am damn furious indeed.

[22:00] <El_Che> woolfy1: why do you care if someone does not like a mascotte. I am pretty sure there is lots of stuff you hate with good reasons

[22:00] *** aborazmeh left
[22:00] <woolfy1> And if people would care about me to stay in the Perl-community, today's discussions and tone of voice and abscense of protest against those words, were not the right way to keep me in the community.

[22:00] <El_Che> that's really what the mascotte feels like to me and everyone I've shown them at work

[22:01] <El_Che> there has been zero positive reactions about it

[22:01] <woolfy1> I do care because I have put a f**king amount of work in it.  And because of the words you used.

[22:01] <El_Che> you are projecting the infant to the maker

[22:01] <woolfy1> You want a ragequit instead of a grieve-sad-quit?  You got it

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> woolfy1: but‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶

[22:01] <woolfy1> exit

[22:01] *** woolfy1 left
[22:02] <El_Che> you could see it as: "it looks like what adult think children likes"

[22:02] <El_Che> -s

[22:02] <El_Che> it does not mean the adult is infantile

[22:03] <El_Che> it means the the good intentations did not result in the desired outcome

[22:03] <El_Che> that's something completely different

[22:03] <El_Che> I have told a zillion go people that I don't like their mascot much. They don't care :

[22:03] <El_Che> :)

[22:04] <El_Che> that's an healthy attitude in my book

[22:05] <El_Che> there is lots of stuff I dislike where people put hard word in, e.g electronic music

[22:05] <Grinnz> it is hard to get to the perspective of not having an emotional reaction to people disliking something you put work into, or even something you like

[22:05] <El_Che> do techno music fan care that I find their music sounds like an 8 bit nintendo? No they don't care

[22:06] <Grinnz> it's human nature

[22:06] <El_Che> I know loooooooooots of people that don't like perl

[22:06] <El_Che> it's ok

[22:07] <Grinnz> for perl you have to get desensitized to it, or you will have to give up in the first month

[22:09] <El_Che> my point, don't take bad feedback personally. It's a feedback about the effectiveness of a mascot, not about ones work, or ones intention, or talent

[22:09] <El_Che> hell, apple is full of designers and they created a laptop that looked like a toilet seat and one like a wastebasket

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> no it was a trash can and then a cheese grater

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> ah, a laptop?

[22:10] <AlexDaniel> oh yeah, these actually do look like toilet seats‚Ä¶

[22:10] <Grinnz> the first google result for "apple laptop toilet": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook

[22:10] <El_Che> https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/FcHHbWykfxTk54tj.large

[22:11] <Grinnz> I didn't know they made a laptop version of the eMac :)

[22:11] *** kensanata left
[22:11] <Grinnz> or, I guess it was the origin iMac

[22:14] <El_Che> So, to summarize, I respect everyone effort and work --specially woolfie's-- spent on the mascot, I laughed with the 12-years girls anecdote, I am not arguing for chaning the mascot today, but hell will freeze over before I wear a Camelia t-shirt.

[22:15] <rba> Maybe the name change discussion did open our minds so much to think about what all needs to be changed, that we are starting questioning many things.

[22:15] <El_Che> no, I dislike it from the day I saw it

[22:15] <El_Che> damn, I am the grumpy old man waiving his cane to a butterfly

[22:15] <rba> Instead we should focus on the things we have and will stay as they are and use our energy to do things we like.

[22:16] *** robertle left
[22:16] <El_Che> for the record, my 2 daughter have dozens of stuffed animals, I always take something when I am abroad on a conference

[22:17] <El_Che> Camelia didn't get much love

[22:17] <El_Che> they liked suse's and posgres stuff :)

[22:18] <El_Che> (I mostly buy real ones, but once in a while there are nice things in conferences :) )

[22:19] <rba> the suse camaeleon is qute though

[22:19] <rba> postgres stuff toy? what is it?

[22:20] <Grinnz> elephant, I would guess

[22:21] <rba> maybe they both have a better ‚Äûhugability‚Äú :-)

[22:22] <El_Che> blue one

[22:22] <El_Che> you can't go wrong with cameleons and elephants

[22:56] <jnthn> *sigh* No, the mascot is not up for grabs, if nothing else because it's done a good job of filtering out folks who would make a nuisance of themselves in other ways anyway. By, for example, deciding that just because there's a rename discussion, they can drag in any other thing they might wish were different.
