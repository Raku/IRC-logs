[08:51] <pmurias> El_Che: a WASM+WASI future doesn't seem too good for dynamic languages

[08:51] <jmerelo> pmurias: why?

[09:03] *** rindolf joined
[09:07] <pmurias> jmerelo: as of now it's heavily compiled to native languages focused and offers a simplified view of the machine

[09:07] <jmerelo> pmurias: so it's better to just use the JS virtual machine for the time being?

[09:08] <pmurias> jmerelo: I think they are working on adding gc to wasm

[09:08] <pmurias> jmerelo: hard to say how efficent the JS backend will get

[09:09] <pmurias> jmerelo: if you want to run any dynamic language like JS itself instead of Perl 6, the JS virtual machine is a ton better

[09:09] <jmerelo> pmurias: GC is like the single thing that makes it more useful for dynamic languages?

[09:11] <pmurias> GC is pretty important for dynamic languages

[09:11] <pmurias> jmerelo: you mean for js vs wasm?

[09:11] <jmerelo> jmerelo: well, in general. I have no idea what makes anything a good target for dynamic languages.

[09:13] *** __jrjsmrtn__ joined
[09:13] <pmurias> jmerelo: WASM as now mostly offers just a subset of the underlying machine instructions, it's something that MoarVM would run on

[09:13] *** shlomif joined
[09:14] *** eseyman left
[09:14] <jmerelo> pmurias: MoarVM or NQP? Is it better to port the underlying VM?

[09:14] <pmurias> MoarVM

[09:14] <pmurias> jmerelo: it's like targeting ARM

[09:15] *** rindolf left
[09:15] <jmerelo> pmurias: OK, cross-compilation to a particular instruction set.

[09:17] <pmurias> it's like the common question of why don't we target LLVM directly

[09:18] <pmurias> running MoarVM on WASM could work well tho

[09:18] <jmerelo> pmurias: I really have no idea. Why?

[09:21] <pmurias> because both LLVM and WASM offer just a simplified view of the CPU while higher level virtual machines like MoarVM/JVM offer a higher level abstraction with GC/JIT/an object model/etc.

[09:21] <pmurias> it that wasn't needed we could just target x86 directly without MoarVM

[09:22] *** eseyman joined
[09:26] <jmerelo> pmurias: great. Nice :-) Thanks for all the explanations

[16:49] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: no spaces around “—” ?

[16:50] <timotimo> i think that was already in the previous version

[16:59] <bazzaar_> well that works ok, I just fall back to Rakudo Star 2018.04 when wanting to use Inline::Python and matplotlib. I'm a happy customer :-)

[17:00] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar_: wait, why is there a need to do that?

[17:02] <bazzaar_> AlexDaniel: zef install Inline::Python is failing with the 2019.03.01 RC2 (closed issue #33) 

[17:03] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar_: issue #33 in which repo?

[17:03] <tbrowder> hi \o/

[17:04] <bazzaar_> AlexDaniel: sorry, in Inline::Python repo (https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/issues/33)

[17:05] <AlexDaniel> nine: what is this thing about? ↑

[17:07] <tbrowder> off topic, but using either module DBIish or DB:SQLite, how does one get the rowid of the last inserted row?

[17:08] <tbrowder> for sqlite only

[17:08] <timotimo> does sqlite have the "returning" thing?

[17:08] <timotimo> oh

[17:08] <timotimo> https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/last_insert_rowid.html - so we'd need this bound?

[17:09] <tbrowder> sorry

[17:09] <tbrowder> i

[17:11] <tbrowder> if i use the primary unique key sqlite will assign its value automatically so i think i need to know that when associating that row with other tables

[17:12] <tbrowder> never mind, bad question

[17:49] <bazzaar> I've said it a few days ago on here, if I was a prospective perl6 customer, I'd just ignore the 'Whatever' and 'Fun' tabbed pages, 'Whatever' would not mean anything to me.

[17:54] <tbrowder> tony-o: thanks for the reminder, i'll check it out

[17:54] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: I think it should be called “Tools”, please submit a PR here https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org

[17:54] <tony-o> tl;dr is you can get the last id by select last_insert_rowid();

[17:54] <tony-o> :-)

[17:54] <bazzaar> On the perl6/org 'Whatever' page, the link to zef, couldn't that be on a Modules page instead, highlighting a few tasty modules to get the customer excited and then a link to the main module search page. It all seems so abrupt the modules page as it is now. 

[17:55] <tony-o> has it in there for DBIish or DB::*-ish 

[17:56] <AlexDaniel> bazzaar: yeah, that makes sense I think. A pr to perl6.org and https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org can do the trick

[17:58] <bazzaar> AlexDaniel: I'll have a go, I tried to suggest a bunch of changes to Rakudo.org, by raising an issue, but it never got anywhere.

[18:00] <bazzaar> I'm just a newbie as far as git goes, I'd probably be better trying to put all my thoughts into an issue, rather than getting bogged down with PR's and repo's etc.

[21:38] <uzl> Is there a IO::Path routine that behaves in the same manner as https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath?

[21:39] <timotimo> maybe "resolve"?

[21:39] <Geth> ¦ perl6.org: review: https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/commit/aee549b9ef

[21:43] <uzl> timotimo: "resolve" doesn't seem to dereference symbolic links which "realpath" apparently does

[21:44] <uzl> I'm going by this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/37863619

[21:46] <uzl> I tried the same setup in the SO answer but `"b".IO.resolve` returns `"/home/luis/Projects/wyag/b".IO` instead of `"/home/luis/Projects/wyag/a".IO` as in the Python example.
