[05:53] <holyghost> If someone can take a look at http://github.com/theholyghost2/Mathx-Stat and Bayes-Learn, I can rerelease them (using issues)

[05:53] <jmerelo> holyghost: did you delete the releases from CPAN?

[05:54] <holyghost> no

[05:54] <jmerelo> holyghost: That's the first thing you should do.

[05:54] <holyghost> It compiles and has ocvs howwever

[05:54] *** cpan-p6 left
[05:55] <jmerelo> holyghost: That's not the minimum requirement for releasing something on CPAN.

[05:55] <holyghost> also includes tests

[05:55] <jmerelo> holyghost: please run them and come back to us.

[05:55] <holyghost> they run

[05:56] <jmerelo> holyghost: meanwhile, and as stated yesterday, please delete them from CPAN and don't release them again until at least two of us have reviewed them.

[05:57] <jmerelo> holyghost: yesterday you agreed to a series of things, including the fact that something released to CPAN must go beyond a certain level of quality.

[05:57] <jmerelo> holyghost: you seem to have forgot everything we said. 

[05:57] <jmerelo> holyghost: by "run them" I mean "run the tests"

[05:57] <jmerelo> holyghost: really, I'm not going to go every single day over the same old issues.

[05:58] <jmerelo> those repos are exactly the same they were yesterday and in Novembre 2018

[05:58] <holyghost> the tests work I mean

[05:58] <holyghost> I have run them all, they succeed

[05:59] <jmerelo> holyghost: can you walk me through the commands you issued for running them?

[06:00] <holyghost> a perl6 with a flag, they all succeeded

[06:01] <jmerelo> holyghost: those repos you've pointed to have not changed for the last 8 months. They didn't get any better by themselves. The issue is still not addressed. The markdown in README.md is badly formatted.

[06:01] <holyghost> I updated them yesterday

[06:02] <jmerelo> holyghost: in CPAN?

[06:02] <jmerelo> holyghost: the Mathx-Stat repo says "Latest commit 04c683a on 23 Nov 2018"

[06:02] <jmerelo> holyghost: I don't know if you are lying, or simply you don't know better.

[06:03] <holyghost> I used my browser, I'll try later on with a git shell command

[06:03] <jmerelo> holyghost: your GitHub activity panel is empty since December last year.

[06:04] <jmerelo> holyghost: I am starting to lose my patience here.

[06:04] <jmerelo> holyghost: please get your act together.

[06:04] <holyghost> I need to use a git shell, I said, my browser does not work for it

[06:05] <jmerelo> holyghost: No, you need to delete all your modules from CPAN right now.

[06:05] <jmerelo> holyghost: you simply seem unable to use, or understand, the basic tools involved in creating, testing and publishing a module.

[06:05] <holyghost> I'll remove the modules later on

[06:06] <jmerelo> holyghost: Please do it now.

[06:06] <holyghost> I will

[06:06] <jmerelo> holyghost: we'll help you solve all your doubts about publishing modules, git, testing and perl itself when you do that. If you do that, and only if you do that.

[06:31] <jmerelo> thanks, holyghost 

[06:31] <jmerelo> you need to learn how to use git properly

[06:31] <holyghost> np :-)

[06:31] <jmerelo> for starters, it's not called "git shell client". it's simply called git.

[06:32] <holyghost> yes, I have it on Xliff's server

[06:32] <holyghost> I mean git bash etc for windows

[06:33] <holyghost> which is horrible of course :-)

[06:33] <jmerelo> holyghost: git does not need bash. You can download a GitHub client that includes a bash shell with git in it. But git can be installed in Windows and used directly. You can also use it from the Ubuntu subsystem (in W10)

[07:33] <jmerelo> holyghost: all guidelines for publishing a module are public. You should create a checklist yourself and follow it strictly. 

[07:34] <jmerelo> holyghost: we can't help you with a blanket "review". We can help you if you have specific doubts about the procedure.

[07:34] <holyghost> jmerelo, I won't upload anything 

[07:34] <holyghost> ah

[07:34] <holyghost> So I have to specify, ok

[07:35] <jmerelo> holyghost: just a cursory look at the code shows that it will not compile in some cases. That's why you need to go through all the things that have laid out in the issues in Bayes, which I will not repeat in other modules.

[07:35] *** domidumont joined

[09:16] <masak> lizmat: is the "huh?" comment because you didn't expect your override to work and give the value 42? because it looks unsurprising to me...

[09:17] <lizmat> this was about holyghost's way of testing

[09:17] *** feldspath_ joined
[09:17] <lizmat> holyghost is always testing 1+1 versus 1+1

[09:17] <lizmat> which passes, but 1+1 is still giving the wrong result

[09:18] <lizmat> so the huh? was about "but I thought I tested it correctly before?"

[09:18] *** feldspath left
[09:18] *** feldspath joined
[09:19] <masak> oh, I see!

[09:19] <masak> yes, hidden assumptions are hidden

[09:20] <masak> in general, `is X, X` for any X is pretty unnecessary... unless we're testing equality itself

[09:21] *** feldspath_ left
[09:21] <timotimo> masak: unless X is something that you would like to verify doesn't modify state that changes its outcome for the next time

[09:22] <masak> I'm not sure I'd consider that exceptional case to be very strong

[09:23] <timotimo> yeah, it's not very strong, and it's surely not the only kind of test you should have, not by a long shot

[09:23] <masak> mostly because I was on the verge of saying something about `is <actual value>, <expected value>`, and your case doesn't follow that pattern

[09:23] <timotimo> there's also one test of the form "ok <actual value>, <expected value>;"

[09:23] <timotimo> which is wrong for different reasons

[11:27] <lizmat> please make an issue...

[11:45] <tobs> How do I add a multi candidate via .^add_method? Specifically I want to add a particular ACCEPTS method to an enum.

[11:45] *** skav left
[11:45] <timotimo> tobs: i think there's actually an .^add_multi_method perhaps

[11:47] <tobs> timotimo: you're right, there's a role Metamodel::MultiMethodContainer but it's not documented it seems

[11:47] <jmerelo> tobs: I heard documented

[11:47] <timotimo> haha

[11:48] * tobs flies to the doc issues

[11:49] <jmerelo> tobs: but yep, you're right. Since Metamodel::* are implementation dependent, we're doing that... slowly. A bit slowlier than the rest, anyhow.

[11:50] <jmerelo> tobs: grateful if you raise the issue.

[12:29] <holyghost> I managed to make a XCode, Objective-C prototype of a game for perl6, Xliff I'll upload to objc on the ama server

[12:30] *** skids joined
[12:30] <holyghost> 1000 lines of quest for glory thingies

[12:31] <holyghost> I know it's copyrighted, don't worry

[12:31] <SmokeMachine> I would love if someone write a iOS perl6 app like pythonista (but for perl6)

[12:32] <SmokeMachine> http://omz-software.com/pythonista/

[12:32] <SmokeMachine> does anyone know how possible it is?

[12:34] <holyghost> that's easier than it looks, but however I don't know how to make a perl6 iOS app

[12:35] <holyghost> You can use the SDL2 module for the widgettree or Gtk for a prefab widget system

[12:35] <holyghost> so you need a gfx module to make an editor

[12:35] <holyghost> I worked on Aldhebrand perl IDE for macos in objc

[12:35] <holyghost> It was never fnished though :-)

[12:37] <holyghost> It's on Xliff's ama server, in the objc dir

[12:37] <holyghost> holyghost's home dir then objc dir

[12:38] <holyghost> Then AFAIK you need pango for syntax highlighting

[12:38] <holyghost> or again XCode, cocoa features

[12:39] <holyghost> pango is an old gnome system for fonts AFAIK

[12:39] <sdo> hello

[12:39] <holyghost> hi

[12:40] <sdo> Is there anyequivalences for Perl 6 to use CGI?

[12:40] <sdo> I found Astaire but can't intall it from zef

[12:40] <sdo> hi holyghost

[12:41] <holyghost> sdo, maybe it's on github

[12:41] <sdo> ok

[12:41] <holyghost> I wouldn't know if there's perl5's use CGI etc in perl6, I'm no web dev

[12:42] <timotimo> sdo: yeah, astaire is suuuuuper old

[12:42] <timotimo> 2010 was the last meaningful commit

[12:43] <timotimo> there are FastCGI modules for perl6, and there's an SCGI module

[12:43] <timotimo> also ,there's an adapter between FastCGI and PSGI

[12:44] <sdo> I found SCGI but couldn't figure out how it worked :-(

[12:44] <timotimo> to be honest, perl6's startup can be a problem for something like web apps

[12:44] *** pmurias left
[12:45] <timotimo> pretty much every web framework we have should support just listening on a local port, so that you can use mod_proxy or similar in your actual web server to make it reachable

[12:45] <masak> what about Cro?

[12:45] <timotimo> that way the web server can handle SSL and HTTP2 and all that, while your app can just receive requests and deliver responses via simple HTTP

[12:45] *** abraxxa left
[12:46] *** abraxxa joined
[12:46] *** abraxxa left
[12:50] <sdo> Ok I check thanks for the advices

[12:50] <timotimo> cro is very good

[12:50] <timotimo> powerful if you need it, but simple enough if you don't

[12:53] *** leont joined
[12:53] <masak> I guess my question is really "should we recommend Cro by default to people who come and ask #perl6 about web frameworks?"

[12:55] <masak> also, I'm a bit freaked out that people even find the Web.pm project, let alone Astaire -- maybe I should put up a big warning about staleness and bitrot?

[12:55] *** Manifest0 left
[12:57] <timotimo> perhaps :)

[12:57] <timotimo> if you only edit the github project description, you can change things without the date moving up

[13:00] <holyghost> .tell Xliff, there's an objc dir now on the ama server, you can take a look for MacosX apps (XCode from apple, objective-C as a language), a game system and Sound Studio WIP

[13:00] <yoleaux> holyghost: What kind of a name is "Xliff,"?!

[13:08] <holyghost> It's nethack licensed, I hope to release "our" game under that license with the default perl licenses

[13:08] <holyghost> It's a nice license for games :-)

[13:10] <holyghost> haha, only serious, I might add a ncurses system except for the collision detection *lol*

[13:10] <Xliff> FIRST! Before any games. I want to get you to learn how to set up build and dependency scripts so that your releases improve!!!

[13:11] <holyghost> I'd like to make a nethack/roguelike with gfx

[13:32] <holyghost> Xliff, there's a page for nethack game development (and roguelikes for that) on http://nethack.org/docs/nh362/ it includes dungeon compiler syntax and so on, I need to read that first before next week, then do my thing on Mathx::Stat and Bayes::Learn (JJ's issues on github)

[13:33] <holyghost> So we have enormously time left before you have to do anything :-)

[13:56] <holyghost> Xliff, you are of course free to mail me with game ideas, but, the graphical interface I've done many times, so we need to debug that first then write *any* type of game with it, then personally I'd like to setup *a* RPG system

[13:59] <holyghost> Xliff, I guess game modules have to be made for it as stated above, but nothing too difficult, e.g. no Baum-Welch algorithm or an ANN and so on

[14:00] <holyghost> The drawing of images should be the first thing I work then make adapter code, AFAIK, for any game entities

[14:00] <holyghost> *work out

[14:01] <holyghost> I mean the design pattern for an adaptor

[14:03] <holyghost> Basically, you just make several Entity subclasses paint them from a list in a loop, update them each loop and you have a game server

[14:03] <holyghost> Room subclasses update likewise

[14:03] <holyghost> you just scroll of a stupid backgroundd image and you're done

[14:04] *** curan left
[14:04] <holyghost> Then adapters just get dispatched to game subsystem such as e.g. a physics engine 

[14:04] <holyghost> *game subsystems

[14:05] <holyghost> Then AI messages, as the word says, are very noisy code which dispatch a AI message to the DM, NPCs, PC and so on

[14:06] <holyghost> NPC=nonplayerchar, PC=player char DM=dungeon master

[14:06] <holyghost> That's the most easy thing you can do to make a game

[14:08] <holyghost> AI,gfx and gameplay, then opengameart.org for example

[14:09] <holyghost> Xliff, also I do make my own graphics sometimes, I'm not terrific but I can manage

[14:09] <holyghost> I mostly use The Gimp

[20:58] <antoniogamiz> moritz: hi! 

[20:59] <antoniogamiz> moritz: why do you add every new definition/reference to $*DR?

[20:59] <antoniogamiz> if you use them later reading them from %routines-by-type

[20:59] <Xliff> Is there a way to create an enum of objects, or constants of objects?

[21:00] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:01] <Xliff> When I try enum, I get: Cannot auto-generate a proto method for 'Int' in the setting

[21:01] <Xliff> When I try constants, I get: Missing serialize REPR function for REPR CStruct (Clutter::Raw::Types::ClutterColor)

[21:04] <Xliff> ClutterColor is the CStruct I use as a base for the object Clutter::Color. Code is here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-Clutter/blob/master/lib/Clutter/Raw/Types.pm6#L552

[21:04] <timotimo> that means an instance of that struct is ending up in the serialized blob

[21:05] <timotimo> i.e. an instance was alive at the point where precomp finished

[21:05] <timotimo> i don't see a reason why cstruct shouldn't have support for that, though

[21:05] <Xliff> What's the best way to store objects (ie CStructs) as global types?

[21:06] <Xliff> Right. Otherwise, it would be impossible to have global types for a CStruct... unless they were already in C.

[21:06] <timotimo> hum?

[21:17] <Xliff> timotimo: I want to map NAME to OBJECT. I'd like to do it using ENUMS

[21:17] *** aindilis joined
[21:17] <Xliff> Can constants be defined in INIT?

[21:18] <timotimo> nah, "constant" is compile-time-constant

[21:18] <Xliff> :(

[21:18] <Xliff> So I can't use enums, and can't use constant.

[21:18] <Xliff> So it looks like hash-defined-in-init.

[21:19] <timotimo> if you know the keys up front, you can at least have a bunch of variables that get assigned to during init time

[21:20] <timotimo> if you don't know the keys yet at compile time, how do you expect to use the enums :)

[21:20] *** skids left
[21:20] <Xliff> I know the keys.

[21:21] <timotimo> OK

[21:21] <Xliff> Trying INIT block, now.

[21:23] <Xliff> Getting serialize REPR using INIT block, as well.

[21:34] <Xliff> Hmmm....

[21:34] <Xliff> Using our $OBJECT in INIT worked. Now I have an even weirder issue.

[21:35] <Xliff> I have an object with 4 guint values. guint := uint8

[21:35] <Xliff> So why is it that I am getting signed values?!?

[21:35] <Xliff> *values back from C?!?
