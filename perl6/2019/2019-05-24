[03:40] <swissChili> Hey folks, I'm trying to learn perl6 again, I've used perl5 estensively but am fairly new to perl6. How can I check if a file exists in p6?

[03:41] <swissChili> I've looked on the subroutine docs and can't find anything

[03:42] <sjn> m: say "/etc".IO.e

[03:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: ¬´True‚ê§¬ª

[03:43] <sjn> it's an IO method

[03:43] <sjn> m: say "/etc/example".IO.e

[03:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: ¬´False‚ê§¬ª

[03:44] <sjn> swissChili: docs at https://doc.perl6.org/routine/e

[03:46] <sjn> a good place to start when you already know Perl 5 is to check out the migration guides at https://doc.perl6.org/language.html

[03:48] <swissChili> great, thank you so much!

[03:48] <swissChili> From what I gather perl style flags (-e, -m, etc) aren't a thing in p6, is that correct?

[17:56] <sena_kun> I think "yes"

[17:56] <MasterDuke> yeah

[17:56] <samcv> ok. then yeah. my package works but can be simplified now :)

[17:56] <samcv> maybe why it's failing the build. in addition to maybe other things. i used to have to use sed on binary files to change the directory :)

[17:56] <kawaii> timotimo: ah, no it's the API::Discord module I maintain :)

[17:56] <samcv> so now it's muchhh easier to do :)

[19:53] <antoniogamiz> can someone tell me difference between when :(Pod::FormattingCode $) and :("",Pod::FormattingCode $,"")

[19:53] <antoniogamiz> ?

[19:53] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, where is this from?

[19:54] <antoniogamiz> htmlify

[19:55] <antoniogamiz> there's a comment that says             # XXX: Remove when extra "" have been purged

[19:55] <sena_kun> both are signatures, first one takes a Pod::FormattingCode object(though leaves it anonymous), the second takes three arguments, two are constant empty strings, in between there is a Pod::FormattingCode.

[19:56] <sena_kun> m: sub foo("", Int $_, "") { say $_ }; foo('', 42, '')

[19:56] *** ravenousmoose_ left
[19:57] <sena_kun> so it enforces a call like `'', $code, ''`, though I don't have an idea for what it can be necessary, you can be interested in taking a look at callers

[19:57] <antoniogamiz> that happens a lot in htmilify xdd

[19:57] <antoniogamiz> thanks sena_kun

[19:59] <sena_kun> I don't know what you are doing, I would just look at recent attempts to rewrite the whole thing from scratch... but that's just me. good luck, anyway.

[20:00] <sena_kun> s/doing, /doing, but /

[20:00] <antoniogamiz> I'm trying to understand how definitions are made 

[20:00] *** discord6 left
[20:00] *** veesh left
[20:02] *** ravenousmoose_ joined
[20:03] * sena_kun would stick a `say $_` at https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/htmlify.p6#L570 and something like `say normal`, `say a thing with weird "" around` in `when` blocks, and then run the thing to see what it prints out and what items go into ("", Pod::FormattingCode $, ""), and what items go into :(Pod::FormattingCode $), once you can figure the difference in input, you can think of what to do with it.

[20:07] <antoniogamiz> this is also to build tests and move that logic to Perl6::Documentable

[20:39] <antoniogamiz> use say everywhere is the best debugger :D

[20:40] <sena_kun> I remember Comma to be unable to parse htmlify, not sure if it is so today

[20:41] <antoniogamiz> Comma?

[20:41] <sena_kun> https://commaide.com/

[20:41] *** Manifest0 left
[20:42] <antoniogamiz> uoh :oo

[20:42] <sena_kun> yes, unfortunately, it cannot process htmlify.p6 as it is now. :/

[20:43] <antoniogamiz> for the moment :D

[20:43] <sena_kun> yup

[20:44] <jnthn> sena_kun: Hm, why not?

[20:44] <sena_kun> jnthn, it fails to parse it in multiple places

[20:45] <sena_kun> for example, `=begin` with an indentation, `>>` operation in an expression(which is a hard one)

[20:46] <kawaii> I should probably update my Comma, still using the release version

[20:47] <sena_kun> kawaii, hmm, what release?

[20:47] *** Manifest0 joined
[20:47] <kawaii> sena_kun: like the first public release of the community edition

[20:47] <jnthn> Ah, then yes, there is a newer community one than that. :)

[20:48] <sena_kun> and it fixes a number of bugs

[20:49] <kawaii> can I just overwrite the files with the files from the new tarball?

[20:50] *** discord6 left
[20:50] *** discord6 joined
[20:50] *** tyilanmenyn joined
[20:50] <sena_kun> better to put it in the sibling directory, and once you migrate, you can just remove the old one

[20:51] <jnthn> sena_kun: Will see if I can figure out any of the htmlify.p6 issues...at least when I'm not distracting myself with $shiny-new-feature :)

[20:51] <sena_kun> jnthn, good luck.

[20:51] <jnthn> heh, for the =begin identation one and my recollection of the grammar there, "good luck" is indeed useful :)

[20:51] *** discord6 left
[20:52] <sena_kun> this way, I hope a grahical debugger will be helpful for antoniogamiz to hack on docs. ;)

[20:56] <uzl> Hello #perl6!

[20:56] <sena_kun> o/

[20:56] <timotimo> greetings uzl

[20:57] <uzl> So do I pass an array of values to a MAIN with an array signature?

[20:57] *** Manifest0 left
[20:57] <uzl> greetings, sena_kun and timotimo!

[20:57] <antoniogamiz> o/

[20:58] *** discord6 joined
[20:58] <AlexDaniel> uzl: you mean like, properly? I don't think it actually works, but if you have sub MAIN(:@foo) you can then do --foo=42 --foo=43

[20:59] <AlexDaniel> it only works if you have zero, two or more elements

[20:59] *** discord6 left
[21:00] <MasterDuke> hm, didn't someone say they were going to work on that recently

[21:00] *** discord6 joined
[21:00] <uzl> AlexDaniel: Oh, I see! Do you think a similar behavior will ever be part of Rakudo?

[21:00] *** [Sno] left
[21:01] <AlexDaniel> uzl: it's already part of rakudo, it just doesn't work if you only pass one argument

[21:01] *** [Sno] joined
[21:01] <AlexDaniel> ah wait

[21:01] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2797

[21:01] <AlexDaniel> according to this ticket, it was recently fixed

[21:02] <AlexDaniel> so lizmat++ and feel free to use it :)

[21:02] <uzl> BTW, what does the '<foo>' symbolizes in the usage message?  A list of values?

[21:03] <kawaii> sena_kun: wow, Comma detected my previous installation and asked if I wanted to import my settings :O

[21:03] <sena_kun> kawaii, well, it is based on IntelliJ, and IntelliJ does that. ;)

[21:03] *** tyilanmenyn left
[21:04] <AlexDaniel> uzl: it doesn't symbolize anything I think, IMO it should say foo instead of <foo>

[21:04] <sena_kun> so you don't want to overwrite anything, really, just enough to get a new one, import settings, possibly remove the old one if you want, and get back to work with new features. :]

[21:04] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: do i need any additional plugins to also use comma for c (moarvm) development?

[21:04] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:04] <AlexDaniel> uzl: although, if you have something like `sub MAIN(‚Äòfoo‚Äô)`

[21:04] <AlexDaniel> uzl: then it'll be foo instead of <foo>

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> uzl: man git seems to use a similar notation

[21:06] <AlexDaniel> where fixed strings like subcommands are shown as is and everything else is in <>

[21:06] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, do we have a lot of Perl 6 code in moarvm? If it is (almost) pure C, then I'd take something that you are using usually.

[21:07] <MasterDuke> sena_kun: not a lot of perl 6 code. i mean to use comma for the pure c

[21:08] <sena_kun> MasterDuke, no, Comma is a Perl 6 IDE. You can try out CLion, which is based on IntelliJ as Comma is.

[21:10] <uzl> AlexDaniel: Thanks for the explanation. I just noticed that the foo example in the issues uses a named array but I'm trying with a positional (e.g, sub MAIN(@foo) { ... }).

[21:10] <uzl> Is it possible to use a positional instead?

[21:10] *** discord6 left
[21:10] <AlexDaniel> uzl: yes, just has to be *@foo

[21:13] <uzl> Oh, great! Thanks. The reason why it needs the '*' is the same reason why one would use in a regular subroutine right?

[21:13] <uzl> I mean... for the slurpy behavior.

[21:15] *** patrickb joined
[21:15] <AlexDaniel> uzl: I guess, but it makes me wonder why `sub MAIN(@foo)` works at all

[21:15] <AlexDaniel> shouldn't it complain or something?

[21:17] <uzl> It doesn't work on my end! That's why I was struggling with it ;-)!

[21:17] <nadim_> I have a sub that returna  Str but I want it to return a variable container. how does one do that? 

[21:17] <uzl> It prints out the usage message.

[21:17] *** synopsebot left
[21:17] <uzl> nadim_: return-rw?

[21:18] <nadim_> ah, right!

[21:18] <uzl> nadim_: https://docs.perl6.org/syntax/%20return-rw

[21:18] *** redhands joined
[21:18] <nadim_> I read about it yesterday :) memory is not so goodany longer

[21:19] <nadim_> but what if one wants to return some variables as rw and other ro?

[21:21] <uzl> I'm not a 100% sure but wouldn't using just `return` returns a value which means it's ro since it cannot be mutated?

[21:21] <uzl> Or do you mean returning both from the same subroutine?

[21:22] <nadim_> returning both

[21:25] <AlexDaniel> doesn't complain and doesn't work

[21:25] <uzl> AlexDaniel: Yeah, it works for me too. I was just confirming that without the *, the usage message is printed.

[21:25] <uzl> with just @foo

[21:25] <uzl> So I guess it's working as expected
