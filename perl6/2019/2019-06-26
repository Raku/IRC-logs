[09:29] * masak .oO( cannot, as in prohibited for religious reasons )

[09:32] <jnthn> :D

[09:36] *** Marcool joined
[09:36] <Marcool> Hi all, does anybody here use the Comma IDE by any chance?

[09:37] <masak> yes! \o/

[09:37] <masak> but it feels like you have a followup question

[09:37] <jnthn> Nearly every day :)

[09:37] <masak> jnthn: oh, you're a user too? nice! :P

[09:38] * jnthn mumbles something about dog food

[09:38] <Marcool> masak: indeed :)

[09:38] <masak> jnthn: eeew :P

[09:38] <Marcool> I'm trying to start out with it‚Ä¶ but it's giving me parsing errors on perfectly valid code

[09:38] <masak> how rude

[09:39] <jnthn> Marcool: Do you have an (preferably somewhat small/isolated) example?

[09:39] <masak> I've noticed that, once the parse fails, the rest of the document typically turns red.

[09:41] <Marcool> such as this : https://pasteboard.co/Ilbj2oh.png

[09:41] <jnthn> masak: If it gets confused enough, that can be a last-gasp behavior, though it's also not a very desirable one.

[09:41] <Marcool> jnthn: I was just in the process of extracting an example from longer code

[09:41] <jnthn> Marcool: I suspect the most interesting thing in that example is behind the tooltip, which I can't read because of the tooltip :)

[09:42] <jnthn> Also, is that `;` really valid there?

[09:42] <masak> I think it's the semi... right

[09:42] <masak> my guess is that's invalid code

[09:42] <masak> look, it fails right after the semi

[09:42] <Marcool> well the sorry the ; is wrong

[09:42] <Marcool> it's not in the original code

[09:42] <masak> haha :)

[09:42] <Marcool> :)

[09:43] <masak> but that's what's wrong here, I suspect

[09:43] <masak> ("I accidentally pasted a completely different bit of failing parse") :P

[09:43] <Marcool> hum‚Ä¶ no I was looking in the wrong place, that ; is there in the original code‚Ä¶

[09:44] <Marcool> but strangely it compiles and runs fine

[09:44] <Marcool> only Comma can see it's wrong :/

[09:44] <jnthn> m: class C { has $.foo; }; C.new(foo => 'bar' ; ).foo.say

[09:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9b639961c: OUTPUT: ¬´Unexpected named argument 'foo' passed‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[09:45] <jnthn> Marcool: Curious, it doesn't fail like ^?

[09:45] <jnthn> Though you're right that it's not actually a syntax error

[09:46] <jnthn> (According to the Perl 6 compiler)

[09:46] <Marcool> jnthn: it defenitely doesn't trigger a complier error, cos the whole code runs, I'm just wondering if I actually ever test that code path though‚Ä¶

[09:46] <Marcool> maye this never runs

[09:46] <Marcool> (it is an exception handler after all)

[09:48] <lizmat> heh, Damian made it to HN  :-)  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20281760

[09:52] <Marcool> lizmat: oh yeah that was a good read :)

[09:55] * tadzik started of with the comment section :P

[09:56] <tadzik> praise TheDamian++ for the good press

[09:57] <jnthn> Marcool: So...a Comma parser bug probably found you a real bug? :D

[09:58] <jnthn> But yeah, it should probably both parse it as the compiler does *and* then give you an annotation like "this semi is probably not meant to be here"

[09:59] <Marcool> jnthn: no I totally get that semi shouldn't be there, I'm fine with the error, just supprised that project had been compiling fine before

[10:00] <lizmat> jnthn: cro supports WebSockets, no ?

[10:02] <jnthn> lizmat: Sure

[10:02] <lizmat> so why doesn't the blurb on cro.services mention that  :-)

[12:00] <kawaii> Are there any modules in the ecosystem for taking config values from a JSON file and seeding the environment with them? :)

[12:13] *** dolmen joined
[12:23] *** candr joined
[12:27] *** zakharyas joined
[12:27] <candr> Is there any way I can do something like "tap" stdin? I want to monitor for key presses in a async thread, but in a non-blocking way. I am currently trying to use getc with a timeout but it seems like a pretty hacky solution and the timeout starts yet another thread that seems unnecessary.

[12:35] <candr> also, with my current solution I can really only recognize a  "enter" key press because of getc()...

[12:38] <tobs> candr: $*IN is an IO::Handle that you can call the .Supply method on to get a supply, which you can in turn tap. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. IO::Handle.Supply looks like it was supposed to give you a chunked file reader instead of an something interactive.

[12:38] *** ravenousmoose_ joined
[12:38] <tobs> that you have to wait for enter to be pressed is because of line buffering, I assume.

[12:40] <tobs> candr: There is a Term::ReadKey module in the ecosystem which turns that off and already seems to present key presses as a Supply.

[12:41] *** ravenousmoose left
[12:42] <candr> Oh cool! I did not even think of looking at modules yet... was zoned in to looking at built in stuff. I will check that out.

[12:57] <candr> shoot... I need my program to also work on windows and ReadKey relies on some unix c libraries... windows always has to make my life difficult.

[13:02] <candr> time to experiment with WSL again I guess...

[13:04] <Marcool> Any reason why atom gives a "Error: spawn perl6-langserver ENOENT

[13:04] <Marcool> ?

[13:04] <Marcool> when perl6-langserver in a terminal window works fine‚Ä¶ ?

[13:07] * masak .oO( ENOENT: could not locate Treebeard )

[13:08] <Marcool> masak: Treebeard? Is Saruman behind this?

[13:08] <masak> he's a big believer in technology, so the smoking gun is there, I'd say

[13:09] <Marcool> black magic this stuff‚Ä¶

[13:09] <Marcool> so where did my ENT go then‚Ä¶? :P

[13:10] <masak> in all seriousness, NOENT means "no such file or directory"

[13:11] <masak> so there's something it doesn't find, maybe `perl6-langserver`

[13:11] <masak> ENT as in "directory ENTry"

[13:15] <masak> yeah, it's not really about ents at all

[13:16] *** khisanth_ left
[13:17] <masak> I think "[directory] entry" was considered a more all-inclusive term than just "file", which doesn't always cover strange things like directories, pipes, and stuff

[13:17] <masak> that, and the regular Unix/C tendency to use few letters for important things

[15:06] <nepugia> a google survey?

[15:07] <jmerelo> nepugia: it's a survey to know better Perl 6 users

[15:07] *** molaf left
[15:07] <nepugia> well, biased results, but good luck

[15:08] <jmerelo> nepugia: I know I'm going to regret this, but...

[15:08] <jmerelo> nepugia: why will results be biasesd? You don't need to authenticate. It's just a web form.

[15:09] <nepugia> because not everyone trusts google with their responses, so atleast in that regard it will be biased

[15:09] <jmerelo> nepugia: you don't trust Google with the fact that you're been using Perl 6 for more than a year? Or less?

[15:11] <moritz> every poll/survey you do online will be biased

[15:11] <jmerelo> There's only a question that's mandatory, and it's not age. 

[15:11] <jmerelo> moritz: for starters, for people who _do_ find out about it. Also, for people who are actually online.

[15:12] <kawaii> I thought the survey was good. :)

[15:12] <kawaii> Not too personal, and covered a lot of ground.

[15:14] *** rindolf left
[15:16] <nepugia> jmerelo: i don't trust them in generall, i don't evalute every perl specific query of whether that would be okay :P

[15:37] <TreyHarris> nepugia: I very much doubt the number of people who share your view (refuse to consider using anything where a "*.google.com" URL pops up) is enough to bias the whole survey.

[15:38] <nepugia> TreyHarris: It is already biased, even if not by much ;)

[15:39] <TreyHarris> I'd note that other form-hosting sites have had serious XSS and data breaches and frequently have ads or trackers

[15:39] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: not to mention Facebook, Amazon and Google tracking cookies.

[15:39] <TreyHarris> So just _navigating to_ one of them would give me pause.

[15:39] <moritz> back when I hosted perl6.org, I'd occasionally look at the referers

[15:40] <moritz> and of all the search engine referers, google made up at least 95%

[15:40] <moritz> ususally more around 98/99%

[15:40] <moritz> so google avoiders can't be more than 5%, more likely much less

[15:41] <jmerelo> moritz: as a mather of fact, I've been looking up Perl 6 related concepts in several search engines, including yandex. None of them come close to Google in terms of accuracy.

[15:41] <jmerelo> moritz: and I'm really sorry for DuckDuckGo, who are very Perl friendly, and all around good persons. But somehow the "6" in the name does not register too much.

[15:43] *** Possum joined
[15:43] <jmerelo> Also, at the end of the day, we are using those freedom-loving companies, the big telcos, to do all of this, good or bad sites. So, well... traffic encrypted and everything, but still, something will leak

[15:43] <moritz> jmerelo: I also use around ddg for about 30% of my searches, can't say i'm thrilled by their Perl 6 results

[15:43] *** dolmen joined
[15:43] <nepugia> I do use searchx, but i have to admit the results are of very poor quality most of the time

[15:44] <nepugia> especially when the results are pulled in from bing or reddit.. :)

[15:44] <TreyHarris> I worked at Google and was on the Privacy Review team. I think I'm comfortable saying that any fear of giving data to Google, if justified at all, should be based only on your fear of AI targeting. Googlers take data privacy very seriously and after the last incident of an employee looking at user data without blinding it almost ten years ago, steps were taken to make that impossible without automatically

[15:44] <TreyHarris> raising alarms in several other parts of the company as cross-checks.

[15:44] <TreyHarris> An employee today couldn't read a particular person's data if they wanted to--well, if they wanted to avoid getting fired and prosecuted, anyway

[15:45] <nepugia> TreyHarris: The reason i avoid google is not so much the fear of beeing tracked, but moreso the generall believe that a monopoly is not a good thing, no matter what company occupies that space

[15:46] <TreyHarris> nepugia: So you make sure to live somewhere that has choice of electricity and water providers? Where's that? Or do you use a generator and your own well or bottled water?

[15:46] <TreyHarris> (Sorry, I'll drop it now.)

[15:47] <jmerelo> nepugia: monopolies are bad. We've all plaid the game. Been sent to jail. Got that. But it's a survey. We can set up a Raspberry at home and create a Cro website. But this is simply more convenient. We can live with the bias.

[15:47] <nepugia> jmerelo: I am not arguing about that :)

[15:47] <jmerelo> Also, the raspberry would be using the pipes provided by a monopoly or duopoly in most countries. 

[15:47] <jmerelo> I mean, it's just a survey.

[15:47] <nepugia> You can choose whatever tools you think are apropriate, in the end it is only my problem if i don't want to participate

[15:49] <nepugia> TreyHarris: There are cities where you don't have a choice for who provides your elecritiy?

[15:50] <jmerelo> nepugia: there are whole countries.

[15:51] <TreyHarris> nepugia: I've never encountered a city that had two separate power grids except for redundancy for hospitals and such

[15:51] <huf> there's got to be one *somewhere* :D

[15:51] <TreyHarris> You can choose whose generators you're paying, if you want to pick a renewable-only provider, but that's just bookkeeping--you're still gettig the same electrons

[15:51] <nepugia> Sure, but from whom you buy it is still a different story

[15:52] <nepugia> trying to be less dependant on your sorounding is not the same as not wanting to buy from a monopoly :P

[15:52] <huf> how long did it take after the fall of the berlin wall to put both halves of the city on the same grid?

[15:52] <TreyHarris> The company that lays the lines is a monopoly, the company that provides the pipes is a monopoly

[15:53] <TreyHarris> huf: 3 years

[15:53] <nepugia> Doesn't have to be, I really doubt that it is /one/ company anyhow

[15:53] <huf> there we go!

[15:53] <nepugia> in any case.. we are wandering more and more offtopic :)

[15:53] <huf> same city, two grids!

[15:54] <huf> and as we all know, berlin just after the wall came down is a 100% typical example of a city :D

[15:55] <nepugia> berlin as it is now is still a bad example of a city ;)

[15:56] <huf> i mean, it's big. so it's definitely an outlier. the average size of a city has to be very small

[15:56] <jmerelo> Going back to where it's started: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX6cjuhen2xepsr_Cg8eYSdlEE4wbhufgOR1BrDwStby_hNg/viewform

[15:57] <jmerelo> We're up to 175 answers now, I'd like to close it when it reaches around 200 (but it's going ot be difficult)

[15:58] <TreyHarris> difficult to reach 200? or difficult to close it?

[15:59] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: we will just stop paying attention and start charting results

[15:59] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: difficult to reach 200, I would say.

[15:59] <Woodi> hi #perl6 :)

[16:03] <kawaii> hello! o/

[16:03] <Woodi> TreyHarris: I think I like gmail for one thing: they are, imo, first free webmail that goes SSL. and obviously search engine is good. but ;)  a) I HATE advertisements ! and google live from this;  b) free servicess killed self-hosted services...

[16:04] <nepugia> free self hos... no that doesn't work :p

[16:04] <Woodi> but ;)  b) is unrealistic anyway, ppl hate to pay :)

[16:05] <Woodi> nepugia: also administration and upgrades by ppls is a fiction-fiction :)

[16:06] <nepugia> indeed

[16:07] <TreyHarris> I think it's fairly likely that the EU and the US (followed by other countries once those two move) will have laws that allow people to opt out of all advertising and tracking in exchange for paying a fee; recent estimates put it at around US$35 for the typical user (up to about US$40 if you use Gmail, down to US$20 if you don't use Facebook or a free email or other messenging/social media service)

[16:07] <TreyHarris> sorry, those dollar amounts are monthly

[16:08] *** satori__ joined
[16:08] <nepugia> payed to whom?

[16:09] <nepugia> I certainly never agreed to load random third party ressources when i load a site, incidentally i don't even mind ads themselves, i mind the garbage that comes bundled with it

[16:09] <nepugia> (some sites deliver ads as normal pictures, which is just fine imo)

[16:10] <nepugia> TreyHarris: also, how will you opt-out of advertising if it is literally on subway walls, do you get one of those google glass things to censor the ads out? ;)

[16:10] <Woodi> btw. anyone know something about Clojure transducers ? they generalise map/grep/reduce but have some requirements I not grok... eg. chain of map/greps 'fails' so function need to returns error but functions later in chain still need to be called ? - yt-level-knowledge - sory :) or maybe after fail rest of items need to be processed ?

[16:14] <TreyHarris> nepugia: how do subway wall ads track you? I don't follow. The idea is you can choose not to be tracked and to be able to use advertising-supported services by paying the company for the revenue they're losing for not being able to advertise to you. That gives you a third choice besides "be tracked and advertised to" and "don't use the sites". I'm not thrilled with what that means for haves vs. have-nots, but

[16:14] <TreyHarris> you can't regulate companies into losing money (at least not for long and not with their cooperation)

[16:14] <zostay> What are others using for the #! line? I just discovered that if I do run "foo.p6" where the #! is something like #!/usr/local/bin/perl6 that the script gets sent bash instead. I've only found #!/usr/bin/env perl6 to be successful, but that's always felt janky to me, but I still use it.

[16:14] <jmerelo> zostay: #!/usr/bin/env perl6

[16:14] <nepugia> TreyHarris: i never claimed they track you?

[16:15] <nepugia> I already have a third choice now, just don't load the scripts

[16:15] <TreyHarris> nepugia: then why would you think a law covering internet tracking and advertising would have anything to do with a subway ad? You're just being silly 

[16:15] <nepugia> I certainly can't be forced to execute foreign code on my hardware

[16:15] <jmerelo> zostay: not janky... I use it in every language

[16:15] <kawaii> `/usr/bin/env` is a way better way of forming your shebang in most cases

[16:16] <nepugia> doesn't matter what you put into the shebang pretty much, they are not portable, and posix sais the installation script should just rewrite shebangs

[16:17] <nepugia> TreyHarris: You weren't specific, and 40$ something sounds ridicilous if it were only 'online' advertisements

[16:17] <nepugia> >you can't regulate companies into losing money

[16:18] <moritz> sorry folks, could weplease go back to Perl 6 topics?

[16:18] <TreyHarris> nepugia: https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/24/18715421/internet-free-data-ads-cost I'm not making these numbers up

[16:18] <TreyHarris> sure.

[16:18] <TreyHarris> let's drop it.

[16:19] <jmerelo> moritz: let's go to the survey results, for instance. Still, almost 4 out of 5 Perl 6 users come from Perl 5. I would have expected that percentage to go down with time.

[16:19] <jmerelo> Perl 6 talks outside Perl events are still residual, I'm afraid.

[16:19] <moritz> jmerelo: agreed

[16:28] <TreyHarris> Interesting that my earlier commit lost its PGP signature... I guess autosquashed commits don't get automatically signed even if each commit making them up were signed. Makes sense, but is still surprising.

[16:30] <TreyHarris> It also dates it from the first commit of the autosquash 21 hours ago, not the last commit of, like, 10 minutes ago. Weird.

[16:40] <Woodi> re: Perl6 newcomers: we need app everyone wants like phpmysql or phpbb or blender (python ui). killer ap would be good too :)

[16:41] <Woodi> maybe some monitoring dashboard ?

[16:41] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: Is it a known issue that docs.perl6.org hasn't updated in 11 days?

[16:42] <TreyHarris> It isn't the last time CI passed; CI's been failing a lot longer than that

[16:44] <TreyHarris> Woodi: something with grammars, maybe. I was thinking of trying to write up a generalized tool for something I did many, many times as a sysadmin: classify a file's (or, more often, many files') lines so that you can do statistics on them. I think grammars are helpful for that since you can make tha action record the line number(s).

[16:47] <Woodi> TreyHarris: I just wanted to ask: "let someone tell me Perl6 good features" :)  grammars are first bat what else ?  code readability isn't for users...

[16:47] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: Also, I just included the same code snippet in two places because it explains how two things (Failures and else topicalization) are related. Will the update work include a way to do includes so I could have that code just one place?

[16:49] <TreyHarris> Woodi: for me, I would kill for a framework that does what the Elm architecture does, but I'm not sure if the JS backend is in shape for that kind of heavy lifting yet. A lot of Perl 6 features seem well-suited to that sort of "building up web elements programmatically", if Perl 6 could directly address the DOM, though.

[16:50] *** nepugia left
[16:50] <TreyHarris> Elm is lovely, but even as a 25+ year Haskeller, it frustrates me (though, it has to be said, more often for the parts of Haskell it doesn't implement than for being a Haskell derivative) and I'd like a different language than JavaScript or Elm that can do that stuff

[16:51] <zostay> I will continue to use the /usr/bin/env perl6 shbang, but I did report the my odd behavior as a bug. Hopefully, it's just some odd quirk of how my laptop is setup.

[16:52] <kawaii> I'd like to see a CMS of sorts (i.e. WordPress-Lite) in the Cro framework :)

[16:52] <Woodi> what about Emacs replacement ?  :)

[16:53] <Woodi> or just org-mode.  pleas ?

[16:53] <TreyHarris> Woodi: of all things the world does not need, another programmable editor is the top of the list.

[16:53] <Woodi> can't agree :)

[16:53] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: I just did

[16:54] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: it's done by hand, mostly by me; it can be done by anyone with access to the new site, somehow.

[16:54] <Woodi> we need such able-to-be-programed ui

[16:54] <TreyHarris> jmerelo: you got the version with my typo still in it, dang ;-)

[16:54] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: we should have to do it automatically.

[16:55] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: I can do it again later...

[16:55] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: I'm afraid pod includes do not work yet... 

[16:56] *** pamplemousse left
[16:56] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: now that you mention CI failing, it's this issue: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2977

[16:57] <jmerelo> TreyHarris: I can't get it to work. I have no idea where to obtain the right version of that library from repos, or if they even work for those versions of ubuntu

[16:57] <TreyHarris> I think when you're talking cross-platform programming editors, there's Vim, there's Emacs, and then there are domain-specific editors like IDE's.Sublime Text and Atom and such I think come under the third category "pretty, easy, or whizzy". I think new editors can only enter expecting any chance of being a success, let alone a "killer app", if they're in one of the latter two categories. The "general-purpose

[16:57] <TreyHarris> programmer's editor" is going to continue to be Vim and Emacs for the forseeable future.

[16:59] <TreyHarris> Since Perl 6 isn't really suited yet to being a language you write a beautiful user-facing UI in, I think that puts "editor" in the realm of "stretch goal that makes you work on making the language itself better with no real expectation of ever actually getting the goal thing"

[17:00] *** dolmen left
[17:01] <Woodi> I want such universal *ui/framework*. something something not very specified.... maybe I mean "architecture"  generally editor need anyway ;)

[17:01] <Woodi> *need to be included :)

[17:02] <Woodi> also blender ui architecture is such configurable that I'm jealous :) 

[17:03] <Woodi> so maybe dbus ? ;)

[17:04] <TreyHarris> Woodi: if you can rewrite blender in Perl 6, that will be an amazing feat--and if it's programmamble in Perl 6, it'll immediately be far more accessible than Blender + Lua, since Blender's Python API really requires API programming expertise, and its Lua scripting is a pain

[17:05] <TreyHarris> Actually... not to crap all over Lua, Lua's fine, but you could go down the list of everything that has Lua embedded to look for candidates for your application :-)

[17:07] <TreyHarris> (Though, to be fair, Blender's pretty damn weird-looking as a Windows or Mac application, and "weird-looking" can't be beautiful to a large subset of programmers--an app's first claim to beauty is if it looks at home in its surrounding UI.)

[17:08] <TreyHarris> (Sorry to keep going on this, but one more thought: *I* think Blender's quite beautiful--in its latest version. But I also agree that it just looks wrong on Windows or Mac.)

[17:09] *** kaare__ joined
[17:14] <Woodi> yea, blender is just "full screen" app :)

[17:21] <timotimo> it looks wrong everywhere :) :)

[17:22] <TreyHarris> timotimo: somebody's got to have written a Linux window manager that matches it

[17:22] *** pamplemousse joined
[17:22] <TreyHarris> hell, there's a window manager written in Emacs Lisp now, so I refuse to believe nobody's done that

[17:22] <timotimo> perhaps, but that's far from enough if you still have other programs on the computer

[17:23] <TreyHarris> Gnome may have dropped off the theming train, but KDE is themable enough, if anyone still uses it, I think

[17:24] <Woodi> TreyHarris: what you mean by "clasiffy lines in file" ?  and what's nice in Elm architecture ?

[17:25] <timotimo> i'm sure there's only afew kde users left; most of them have moved on to plasma

[17:25] <timotimo> :P

[17:25] <TreyHarris> Woodi: those were two different thoughts

[17:28] <TreyHarris> Woodi: The "classify" thought: For instance, doing something like Splunk or other operations systems do with logging statistics, or that things like Purify do with giving statistics on a large codebase, so you can get answers like "have my fatal log messages increased over the past month, what's the 99th percentile frequency of exception $x being thrown, how many public static methods do I have in C++ files",

[17:28] <TreyHarris> etc.

[17:28] *** domidumont left
[17:29] <TreyHarris> Woodi: the Elm architecture just has to be experienced (and it's a very fun thing to play around with): https://guide.elm-lang.org/ but, for the tl;dr version...

[17:32] <TreyHarris> It lets you define a web widget in terms where the argument is a datastructure and the output is HTML (provided in a form that makes tags look like functions), and then you just create events that create and modify the datastructure, and voila, you compile down to JavaScript that will provide a live client-side widget. See https://gist.github.com/CliffordAnderson/972907dc8c98b954290723bc68de5fd6 for a simple

[17:32] <TreyHarris> counter example, and that is a full Elm web app in 29 lines of code

[17:33] <TreyHarris> (If you don't know Haskell, it will be pretty inscrutable to you, but if you know Haskell it should be very familiar.)
