[07:07] <huyna> yeah tyil hope we can improve it, right now the DOM::Tiny is faster, with this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber, DOM::Tiny take 7-8s to parse while HTML::Parser::XML take 17-19s

[07:07] <tyil> that's a decent improvement :p

[12:28] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: could you check the redirect now ?

[12:28] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: same as we have perl6docs.github.io

[12:28] <tyil> AlexDaniel: I don't run Geth as a standalone service, but as a Docker container in Kubernetes, though

[12:29] <jmerelo> Also, I wanted to squat the name, just in case.

[12:36] <AlexDaniel> tyil: I tried redelivering and nothing happen, I think the previous instance was holding the port or something like that

[12:37] <tyil> from a GitHub repo?

[12:42] *** finanalyst_ joined
[12:43] <tyil> AlexDaniel: it looks to work for me (check #raku), so perhaps the old container was still shutting down when you tested

[12:43] <tyil> can you retest your case, so we can confirm it works for you?

[12:44] <tyil> I should also spend some time on that NickServ plugin for IRC::Client

[12:47] *** Geth__ left
[12:48] <tyil> ah, it also just takes a long time to shut down

[12:48] <tyil> wonder if I can fix that by listening to the specific signal kubernetes sends

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> tyil: d'oh! I was redelivering the wrong event

[12:48] <tyil> and just immediately disconnecting upon that signal

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> it works

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> thank you

[12:48] <tyil> AlexDaniel: ah, that should also help :p

[12:49] <tyil> glad that it works again :)

[12:49] <tyil> nine: are you running the other Geth?

[12:50] <kawaii> Is there an easy way of measuring how many seconds a subroutine took to run? I'd like to log some console output i.e. "Parse completed in 1.34 seconds"

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> tyil: maybe it's not working fully, actually, because it seems that there's still some output on #perl6-dev

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> tyil: it did redirect the commit message to #raku-dev though

[12:50] <tyil> hmm

[12:50] <AlexDaniel> but some other code path is not working as it should‚Ä¶

[12:50] <tyil> so it's posting to both, now?

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> depends on the payload I think‚Ä¶

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> but it should only post to #raku-dev really, that was my intent

[12:52] <tyil> that's what I expected it to do from your latest commit

[12:54] <AlexDaniel> tyil: it did, yes, but: ‚Äúgeth/master: 10 commits pushed by (Patrick Spek)++‚Äù

[12:55] <AlexDaniel> how did that happen :)

[12:55] <tyil> `git push github master`

[12:56] <tyil> I think the Geth__ (2 underscores) was running the old docker image, I think

[12:56] <tyil> I restarted Geth when I was pushing the new Docker image, maybe I was too quick with restarting Geth there

[19:39] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: and this also applies to you

[19:39] <El_Che> Grinnz: there is no problem with emotions. Some people here were very emotional about the issue, and that's OK

[19:39] <Grinnz> my problem is specifically when the emotions drive comments like andrew's

[19:40] <sjn> It just means that those of us that are optimistic need to compensate a little extra. :)

[19:40] <AlexDaniel> sjn: :)

[19:40] <sjn> I AM OPTIMIST, HEAR ME YAY! \o/

[19:40] <El_Che> emotions is not the opposite of rationality. Some people were very sad/angered/disappointed by the rename, but they didn't call anyone amoral or didn't see Illuminati-like machinations

[19:41] <El_Che> they just expressed how they felt

[19:41] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: ‚ÄúThe hijack lobby‚Äù, yes :)

[19:41] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: exactly

[19:42] <sjn> btw, I'm currently hanging out on the Perl 6 discord. anyone up for a chat? https://discord.gg/bBggC7K <- invite link

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> sjn++ that's really interesting, btw

[19:42] <AlexDaniel> I think rba previously mentioned the idea of voice chats, or something like that

[19:43] <AlexDaniel> I don't use discord but I think the idea is really great

[19:43] <Xliff> Ah. Voice chats.

[19:43] <Xliff> Can't do that right now. I'm watching Jon Oliver in the background. 

[19:44] <El_Che> Xliff: the Brexit ones were hilarious

[19:44] <Xliff> Oh, yes. Yes they were.

[19:48] <discord6> <mj41> now it works

[19:49] <discord6> <sjn üá≥üá¥> alright

[19:50] <sjn> yeah, working mic is needed on Discord. :)

[19:51] <lucasb> AlexDaniel and others: ok, I'm guilt for making a few jokes, but I hope I wasn't disrespectful to anyone, and sorry if I was.

[19:53] <AlexDaniel> lucasb: now if only others were able to chill out while we're working on stuff‚Ä¶

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> that'd greatly reduce the pressure and all of us will be more productive

[20:01] <patrickb> .tel tadzik I'd like to move rakudobrew to its own github project. Are you OK with that?

[20:01] <patrickb> .tell tadzik I'd like to move rakudobrew to its own github project. Are you OK with that?

[20:01] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tadzik

[20:01] <rba> This works just fine. So whenever we need to discuss something and don‚Äòt like to type always, thats an possibility.

[20:02] <patrickb> .tell tadzik Also I'm pondering renaming it to rakubrew. What do you think about that?

[20:02] <tellable6> patrickb, I'll pass your message to tadzik

[20:02] <tadzik> (to the rename)

[20:02] <tadzik> it installs the compiler, and the compiler is called rakudo :)

[20:03] <Xliff> tadzik++

[20:03] *** wamba joined
[20:05] <AlexDaniel> patrickb: by its own github project you mean a new github org specifically for rakudobrew?

[20:05] <AlexDaniel> or moving it into perl6/raku org?

[20:06] <patrickb> I'm fine with both. I just think tadzik/rakudobrew might not be the best place.

[20:07] <Xliff> tadzik: Do you feel rakudobrew is intrinsic to the Raku experience?

[20:07] <Xliff> (fwiw... I do)

[20:08] <tony-o_> it hasn't worked on osx for me for a few months

[20:08] <tony-o_> i've been rebuilding from source, nuking site, and reinstalling when i need to update

[20:08] <tadzik> patrickb: +1 to the org :)

[20:08] <patrickb> Also I turned it into a cpan installable perl6 distro. To keep it clean and dandy I'd like the repo to be called `App-Rakudobrew` so combining the repo rename with a move suggests itself

[20:09] <tadzik> oh that's nice!

[20:10] <patrickb> tadzik: Resoning for the idea of rename was, that the executables one deals with are called raku, and I'm not objected to have it manage different implementations should others come up.

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> I agree that personal repos are less than awesome

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> IIRC you can't even give access to the Settings tab to others

[20:11] <AlexDaniel> but please don't move it before we set up raku github org

[20:13] <patrickb> tony-o_ I'd be interested in more detailed information. I'd like to have rakudobrew working reliably on osx

[21:06] <Doc_Holliwood> did you mean 10, 20, 0?

[21:07] <Doc_Holliwood> note the comma. if not, what do you want to achieve with '0;'?

[21:08] <Doc_Holliwood> if you want to return 0, move that to the end of the block or use an explicit `return`

[21:09] <mj41> I want to catch this "sink" warnings.  These are there by purpose. https://docs.perl6.org/language/phasers#Exception_handling_phasers

[21:10] <mj41> there is example CONTROL {        when CX::Warn { say "WARNING!!! $_"; .resume } in documentation. Going to grep roast for that.
