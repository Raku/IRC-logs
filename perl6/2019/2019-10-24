[15:35] <jaywalkerTux> Hi, I'm a bit confused as to learn whether perl5 or perl6. I'm a absolute beginner in terms of perl but fluent in python. I see that perl5 have much more modules, but perl6 is latest. Which one do you recommend for a perl newbie?

[15:36] <moritz> jaywalkerTux: what do you want do with the language?

[15:37] <jaywalkerTux> Mainly system administration scripts in linux

[15:39] <moritz> I'd actually recommend Ansible then :D

[15:41] <jaywalkerTux> Is it a programming language? It seems like a software

[15:44] <Grinnz> jaywalkerTux: perl6 is now known as raku, and it's not latest, but it is newer - both languages coexist

[15:44] <Grinnz> and i think both of them will be usable for system administration, but you'll probably find more information on those tasks for perl

[15:47] <jnthn> If you want to write scripts that run different tasks concurrently, you'll probably find that aspect of things easier in Raku

[15:47] *** jaywalkerTux left
[15:48] <Grinnz> aaand he didnt see any of that :D

[15:48] <jnthn> :)

[17:45] <jaywalkerTux> Grinnz I did see all of that, thanks to the irclog :)  So, perl5 will be there and maintained as it is(i.e I don't have to worry about it being discontinued after I learn it )? In that case I'll go with perl5 as I can see many scripts I'm interested in are already in perl5

[17:46] <Grinnz> that's correct

[17:46] <timotimo> there are no plans, nor signs, to discontinue perl5

[17:48] <jaywalkerTux> Excellent! I'll go with perl5 then, will hop in here if I'm stuck anywhere while learning. Thanks all for replying(y) 

[17:48] <Grinnz> it would be appropriate to ask in #perl about perl5, and #raku about raku, now

[17:48] <timotimo> yeah, there are people who know perl6 (aka raku) but not perl5

[17:50] <jaywalkerTux> Gothca, thanks :)
