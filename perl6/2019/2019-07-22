[00:28] <timotimo> i wonder if the loads and loads of repeated "requested for settings *" lines hint at something that could perhaps be deduplicated somehow, or if that's just informational and has barely an impact on performance

[08:00] <chloekek> In a regex how can you skip until the first occurrence of the string ']:', and then check if it is followed by ' <'? The regex / ^ .*? ']:' ' <' / skips until the first occurrence of ']: <', even if that comes after the first occurrence of ']:'.

[08:00] <chloekek> I tried putting the non-backtracking : in various places to no avail.

[08:00] <chloekek> Example string that should match: "[foo]: <", but not: "[foo]: [bar]: <".

[08:02] <chloekek> I think : doesn't work if you have a nongreedy .*? before it.

[08:39] <masak> but, hm, it's probably not robus to not finding the "]:"

[10:14] <antoniogamiz> I will do that then!

[10:16] <antoniogamiz> it's kind of messy, sorry for that D:

[10:17] <chloekek> You're writing to the root directory, /, for which you have no permission.

[10:17] <antoniogamiz> it executes everything correctly until the line that writes the file

[10:17] <chloekek> Absolute path on line 15 in CLI.pm6.

[10:17] <antoniogamiz> you're right, what a fail x'd

[10:18] <AlexDaniel`> chloekek : re minecraft stuff, is there a video? Sounds like a nice material for the weekly

[10:19] <antoniogamiz> minecraft stuff? :OO

[10:20] <chloekek> Speaking of which I wish there was a way for Path.copy to not preserve the permission bits.

[10:21] <Xliff> chloekek: Why the use of the $prefix regex in another regex?

[10:21] <chloekek> I want to use it in multiple regexes later.

[10:22] <Xliff> Ah!

[10:22] <chloekek> In particular when people join I want to send MOTD to them.

[10:23] <Xliff> Nifty.

[10:23] <Xliff> I didn't know something like that would work. 

[10:23] <chloekek> I think I'll make a grammar for server stdout lines though, instead of a series of regex checks.

[10:24] *** pat_js left
[10:24] <Xliff> I would have written it: "my regex { .*? ‚Äò]: ‚Äô }; ‚Ä¶ if m/^ <prefix> ‚Äò<‚Äô ‚Ä¶/"

[10:24] <Xliff> LOL!

[12:46] <chloekek> Unless it's still a scalar container, of course.

[12:46] *** sena_kun left
[12:47] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: I've just started using \vars in parameters.

[12:47] <Xliff> Saves me some typing.

[12:48] <AlexDaniel> it makes things look a bit weird without sigils

[12:48] <chloekek> Coming from a Haskell background I'm used to noticing the difference between normal variables and IORefs, which is similar to non-Scalar and Scalar values in Perl 6, except in Haskell you must dereference explicitly.

[12:48] <jnthn> I use := for arrays/hashes in performance-sensitive code where I want to avoid the copying. OTOH, I went on a 30-minute bug hunt last week because that happened somewhere that the copying *was* important.

[12:50] <Xliff> ^^ Anyone want to take a gander at this while I'm still awake?

[12:50] <Xliff> It's a doosy.

[12:51] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: wouldn't it make sense to only copy when there's an attempt to change the original array?

[12:52] <Xliff> jnthn: I'll have to remember that optimization tip.

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> that could make things weird because suddenly changing an array can become slow, but‚Ä¶

[12:52] <AlexDaniel> given that most people don't use binding, it could save some cycles all over the place, right?

[12:53] <chloekek> My understanding: https://glot.io/snippets/febjrur037

[12:59] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Various copy-on-write schemes might be possible, but they're typically harder to get right than it first looks.

[13:00] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: (Will we introduce leaks? Will we need locks to make it threadsafe? etc.)

[13:00] <AlexDaniel> right, cow is what I was thinking about :)

[13:00] <jnthn> So, "maybe", but it may not be easy :)

[13:01] <chloekek> I also like to use Unicode infix operators and I would like to start using the CJK brackets but I have to look up how to make custom digraphs in VS Code Vim plugin.

[13:01] *** yqt joined
[13:02] <chloekek> I want to use the CJK brackets for English natural language messages because then I don't have to worry about nested quotes.

[13:02] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: by CJK brackets you mean ÔΩ¢ÔΩ£ specifically or other brackets?

[13:03] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: which OS do you use?

[13:03] <AlexDaniel> ah, VS

[13:03] <AlexDaniel> ok then I guess windows?

[13:04] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: what about https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode_entry#index-entry-WinCompose ?

[13:04] <chloekek> I'm using NixOS GNU/Linux with VS Code as editor.

[13:05] <chloekek> Yeah the corner brackets.

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: thing is, being able to write certain characters in just one editor is generally kinda limiting

[13:05] <chloekek> Apparently they're more like CJ brackets.

[13:05] <AlexDaniel> so I'd recommend system-wide solutions

[13:06] <chloekek> Ah yeah, that'd be nice.

[13:06] <AlexDaniel> compose key is one of the easiest ones, and existing configs let you type all kinds of other characters intuitively

[13:07] *** yqt left
[13:07] <AlexDaniel> I use a custom keyboard layout, but I don't really recommend it to others :) That being said, https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Keyboard_Layout_Customization (Advanced section)

[13:07] <chloekek> Or remap some of those useless numpad keys to insert such symbols. :)

[13:08] <AlexDaniel> I do some crazy stuff with my layout. In my case, spacebar is AltGr, so all other symbols are on regular letter keys on 3rd and 4th layers

[13:09] *** Kaiepi joined
[13:09] <AlexDaniel> (and if anyone wonders where my space is, it's on ÁÑ°Â§âÊèõ)

[13:12] <chloekek> I've never used compose key before, I'll check it out with setxkbmap.

[13:15] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: you just need to pass one of these options to map it to one of the keys: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/bb5963bac6c421703342df992128dd7f

[13:15] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: and then most layouts already have some compose sequences predefined, I think

[13:15] <AlexDaniel> not the ones you'd need for perl¬†6, but it'll get you started :)

[13:15] <Xliff> I don't know how I lived without the compose key.

[13:16] <AlexDaniel> and then later you can get this: https://github.com/kragen/xcompose/blob/master/dotXCompose

[13:16] <Xliff> Maybe it's because I wasn't programming in Perl6 then and I could continue living in ASCII land.

[13:16] <AlexDaniel> which is a reasonable config, although I'm not 100% happy with it

[13:17] <Xliff> What is a good monospace font for windows with unicode support?

[13:18] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: right? Kinda weird that we have ‚Äúwindows key‚Äù and other crap but not a dedicated compose key

[13:19] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: but then once you start properly fixing the physical layout it doesn't look like a traditional keyboard anymore x)

[13:20] <Xliff> We're at the point where our keyboard glyphs can change as we type.

[13:20] <Xliff> We have that tech right now!

[13:34] <AlexDaniel> that was quick

[13:35] <chloekek> Ten minutes of X configuration further and my hope for the Year of the Linux Desktop has once again sunken by a few miles.

[13:35] <chloekek> Had to edit ~/.XCompose, change the input method and reboot.

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> you have to reboot though :'(

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> or at least restart the X server, which is pretty much the same‚Ä¶

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> I wish there was a way to reconfigure it live

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> or maybe just logging out and back in is enough?

[13:37] <chloekek> Apparently some programs support reloading it.

[13:37] <AlexDaniel> still not very convenient :S

[13:37] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[13:37] <chloekek> It's up to a program to load .XCompose, and GTK calls the configured input method to do this.

[13:38] <chloekek> Oh, also had to add -option compose:ralt to my setxkbmap command.

[13:44] <Xliff> Close, but still not quite there yet.

[13:44] <Xliff> Compose key is still considered a thing for "power" users, so the command line isn't something to fear.

[13:47] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: the user experience is not too bad for that one, actually. IIRC on most systems there's a graphical way to add xkb options from a dropdown, so enabling the compose key is not that difficult

[13:48] *** Xliff joined
[13:48] <AlexDaniel> chloekek: and some basic sequences should be there by default

[13:48] <AlexDaniel> why distros come with shitty default xcompose files? That I don't know. But something is better than nothing :)

[13:49] *** antoniogamiz left

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> oh, they even have that by default!

[18:34] <Elronnd> wildtrees: afaik, gmail often regects attempts to authenticate through smtp/imap, and forces you to go through openid or something

[18:34] <Elronnd> not openid.  Oauth

[18:35] <wildtrees> oh, is that complicated? is there something simpler? I am not married to using gmail, whats the easiest way to do this? I dont have my own mail server 

[18:37] <sena_kun> have you seen https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/9squpl/not_able_to_send_mail_through_gmail_using_an_smtp/ ?

[18:39] <Elronnd> Cost $$$.  I think 5/month

[18:39] <Elronnd> amazon's is closer to 4 actually

[18:39] <Elronnd> or could try hotmail.  Free, but less sexy than gmail
