[05:44] <qzix> Agree you can get the value of Duration with Num but as oulined above you don’t have to yet with Instant we do. Couple other curiouse things to me which is around nowing the actual granularity of these values I think narrow rather than Num me be more appropriate but doing that also seems inconsistent when comparing the Instant values with Durations results.

[08:24] <daxim> does a grammar ever fill in the `list` attribute of the return value of nested `Match`es?

[08:30] <moritz> yes

[08:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar cbc3e72e2: OUTPUT: «(a c)␤»

[08:32] <daxim> no, I mean a `grammar Foo {}` grammar

[08:32] <moritz> these are the two cases

[08:32] <moritz> daxim: a grammar and a regex match produce the same match object structure

[08:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar cbc3e72e2: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[08:34] <moritz> these are two cases where .list is interesting

[08:35] <daxim> can we look at the real output?

[08:35] <daxim> I think the list method call coerces something

[08:36] <daxim> m: grammar Foo { token TOP { <alpha>+ }; }.parse('a').perl.say

[08:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar cbc3e72e2: OUTPUT: «Match.new(orig => "a", pos => 1, hash => Map.new((:alpha([Match.new(orig => "a", pos => 1, hash => Map.new(()), list => (), from => 0, made => Any)]))), made => Any, list => (), from => 0)␤»

[08:36] <moritz> sure, you can say() the match objects, I just recommend doing it at a real terminal

[08:36] <daxim> empty list

[08:36] *** XieST joined
[08:36] <daxim> ok, once again, with the grammar Foo {} construct, is the list attr ever filled in?

[08:36] <moritz> yes, becaues TOP itself wasn't quantified

[08:37] <moritz> alpha is quantified, so $/<alpha>.list makes sense

[08:37] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v XieST

[08:37] <moritz> the other thing that fills Match.list is positional captures

[08:38] <moritz> m: say (grammar { token TOP { (.).(.) } }).parse('abc').perl

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar cbc3e72e2: OUTPUT: «Match.new(list => (Match.new(from => 0, pos => 1, list => (), orig => "abc", hash => Map.new(()), made => Any), Match.new(hash => Map.new(()), made => Any, orig => "abc", list => (), pos => 3, from => 2)), pos => 3, from => 0, hash => Map.new(("" => […»

[08:38] <moritz> m: say (grammar { token TOP { (.).(.) } }).parse('abc').list.elems

[08:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar cbc3e72e2: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[08:38] <daxim> I see, thanks

[08:40] <daxim> what a steal :D

[08:42] <moritz> Apress belongs to Springer, which is focused on scientific publishing; makes more sense to buy separate chapters when a book is > 80 USD

[08:43] <moritz> amazon might have a cheaper ebook, but with DRM

[09:53] <masak> if we're generating bytecode from a language with macros, do we even need to put the macro bodies in the generated bytecode?

[09:54] <masak> I mean, it's not like we're going to call those macros at runtime

[09:55] <masak> (S06 has some wording about `moo()` being a "compile-time call" and `&moo()` being a "runtime call" to the macro. but I don't think that holds up to closer scrutiny. I can elaborate further if someone wants.)

[09:59] <masak> (or, let's put it like this. my current stance "I don't think that works" really means "I'm unable to imagine how that would work". it's perhaps more a limiation in me than anything else.) :)

[10:00] <masak> anyway, given that we're *not* calling macros at runtime, it seems to me we should at most be installing a callable stub which complains when called.

[10:41] <jnthn> masak: Assuming you can export macros, and we have pre-compilation, that's one reason you'd need to. Another less common but possible case would be an EVAL with a macro in lexical scope.

[23:38] <vrurg> What might be causing "Internal error: inconsistent bind result" on a construct like $obj.&routine( $foo, |args )?

[23:40] *** ChoHag left
[23:45] *** zakharyas left
[23:47] <moritz> a bug in rakudo

[23:51] <jnthn> When signature binding fails, the slow-path binder is used to figure out what went wrong and report a good error. That error occurs when instead it is perfectly happy with the binding, so fails to produce the error. This should never happen (and I've not seen it do so for a long time, so congrats or something...)

[23:52] <vrurg> Aha, I guessed it's a bug (the text suggests) but can't strip it down to simple code.

[23:53] *** molaf left
[23:53] <vrurg> Perhaps would have to link to github in my report. Again.
