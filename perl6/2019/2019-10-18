[01:28] <koalaking> Hi, I have a newb question - I am trying to learn inheritance in perl6 - following the book Learning Perl 6. In ex 12.4, I am asked to print using inheritance. Here is a gist - https://gist.github.com/skrisna/57c2e15beed8071faf82094253faeb10#file-p6-inheritance-p6

[01:29] <koalaking> It prints Hamadryas is Hamadryas, Hamadryas, Hamadryas, Hamadryas, Hamadryas 

[01:29] <koalaking> This is not what I expected

[01:29] <koalaking> any suggestions?

[01:30] <koalaking> Thanks in advance!

[03:23] <AlexDaniel> koalaking: yeah, that's not how it works, the object itself is still Hamadryas. With your code you can do something like this: https://gist.github.com/AlexDaniel/47d913c1a02095d815a72613c4f4fb97

[03:23] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to koalaking

[03:24] <AlexDaniel> koalaking: but really you can do just: say Hamadryas.new.^mro;

[03:24] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to koalaking

[03:24] <AlexDaniel> koalaking: also, people are more active on #raku :)

[08:47] <Alex22> hi

[08:49] <Alex22> tyring to compile to bytecode, then run bytecode on moarvm, any good docs?

[09:04] *** Doc_Holliwood left
[09:16] <MasterDuke> Alex22: i don't remember how, but people have talked about it before on these channels

[09:17] <MasterDuke> i'd either try asking again in #raku (people are switching over to there) or searching the irc logs for something like "bytecode" https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log_search/perl6

[15:02] <timotimo> ah, you already have a string though i thought we were working with an array

[15:02] <timotimo> in that case:

[18:47] <fingolfin3> Hi! Can I use only Str for hash keys? I have confused becouse Pair can contain any object for key or value, but this does not seem to be true for hashes.

[18:48] *** abraxxa left
[18:50] <MasterDuke> fingolfin3: you can use other types, those are called object hashes https://docs.perl6.org/language/hashmap#Non-string_keys_(object_hash)

[18:50] <MasterDuke> and fyi, most people are moved over to #raku

[20:01] <xkr47> so what is happening in this old channel? just telling people to move on? :)

[20:02] <sena_kun> xkr47, people are moving to #raku, what'll happen with this channel... no idea.

[20:03] <xkr47> ^^

[21:20] <simcop2387> i'm going to upgrade the install of raku on perlbot (and also probably setup a rakubot) this weekend, i think I ask this every time, but are there any particular libraries or modules that you folks would like added (or removed) when I do so?  only real restriction is that the pastebin and eval can't do network traffic

[21:21] <simcop2387> xkr47: sena_kun: i haven't been told anything official about it, but from what i have heard it'll like end up redirecting to #raku as things move along.

[21:29] <Grinnz> it's pretty much always official. just go there

[21:29] <Grinnz> already*

[21:29] <Grinnz> i guess the docs just have to be updated to point people there if it hasn't
