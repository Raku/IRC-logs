[01:42] <Rich_Morin> Apologies for the OT question, but I can't find Larry's discussion about how breaking the Unix "do one thing well" mantra led to adding more and more power in Perl.  I thought it might be in a Camel Preface, but I don't see it in the copy I have.

[23:01] <ToddAndmargo> anyone on newbie duty?

[23:02] <ToddAndmargo> I just upgraded Fedora from 30 to 31.  I reinstalled rakudo-pkg-Fedora31-2019.07.1-03.x86_64.rpm.  Now p6 can not find any of my modules

[23:02] <phogg> ToddAndmargo: if you get not luck try #raku

[23:02] <ToddAndmargo> # perl6 -I/home/linuxutil/p6lib -MPrintColors -e 'PrintGreen( "Hi\n" );'===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -eUndeclared name:    PrintGreen used at line 1
