[14:33] <antoniogamiz> and have you ever found a program that does not work in that distribution but works in other?

[14:33] *** lucasb joined
[14:34] <tyil> the only times such things have happened is when I either need a newer Perl 6, or I needed a higher module version than what r* shipped with

[14:35] <tyil> are you running into a problem rn that you could show an example of?

[14:35] <antoniogamiz> mmm installing Perl6::Documentable

[14:36] <antoniogamiz> it looks like it does not work in r*

[14:37] <tyil> what is the error you're getting?

[14:37] <noisegul> My best assumption right is that modules shipping with r* are masking dependencies which causes Documentable to get the wrong ones?

[14:38] <tyil> masking dependencies?

[14:38] <noisegul> lack of a better term

[14:38] <antoniogamiz> https://github.com/antoniogamiz/Perl6-Documentable/issues/48

[14:38] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: version 1.1.2 also fails?

[14:39] <noisegul> antoniogamiz: See my follow-up, that's with 1.1.2

[14:39] <tyil> let my try to install Perl6::Documentable with zef

[14:39] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: ah right

[14:40] <ugexe> does your module depend/use any namespace that is also included in rakudo star? if rakudo star installs to $HOME/.perl6 it could be its (old/outdated) modules are getting chosen

[14:41] <noisegul> ugexe: that's what my assumption was

[14:41] <tyil> that should be fixable by adding version numbers to the deps (which they should always have if you need a minimum version)

[14:41] <ugexe> it could also be a transitive dependency

[14:42] <antoniogamiz> I will have to check that then, problem is I did not know I need a minimum version

[14:42] <antoniogamiz> it simply works with rakudo so I will have to check exact versions

[14:43] <ugexe> antoniogamiz: try `mv $HOME/.perl6 $HOME/.perl6.bak`. that should exclude any modules rakudo star has provided (i think).

[14:43] <ugexe> if it then works (or you get a different error, probably about a missing dependency) then your issue is an incompatible old version of something provided by rakudo-star

[14:43] <Geth> Â¦ problem-solving: AlexDaniel self-assigned Issue templates for every label https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/65

[14:44] <antoniogamiz> ugexe: thank you! I will check that :D

[14:44] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: please try this too

[14:45] <noisegul> antoniogamiz: Perl6::TypeGraph causes the error on my test installs

[14:47] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: I know but maybe some of the modules used by typegraph conflicts with r* as ugexe as said

[14:48] <antoniogamiz> well, though now I think about it, it cannot be that because typegraph does not have dependencies

[14:49] <noisegul> antoniogamiz: Will do to reconfirm; If it's not Typegraph dependencies, could it be the Typegraph version itself?

[14:50] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: mm I'm not sure

[14:57] <noisegul> Renaming the .perl6 folder does not change the error, however according to the error it doesn't load it from there anyway

[14:57] <antoniogamiz> It looks like the error is caused by this line =>     state $tg    = Perl6::TypeGraph.new-from-file;

[14:58] <antoniogamiz> I think I know where the error comes from now

[15:00] <antoniogamiz> https://gist.github.com/antoniogamiz/dbdfbd2f65b9866c7181d116b98864d8

[15:01] <antoniogamiz> so that what zef info Perl6::TypeGraph outputs

[15:01] <antoniogamiz> it looks like zef is not installing the module it should

[15:05] <ugexe> it is installing what has been requested

[15:05] <antoniogamiz> ok, I have made zef update and it's working now

[15:05] <ugexe> first, p6doc provides a Perl6::TypeGraph module of version 1.0+

[15:06] <ugexe> or at least it used to 

[15:06] <ugexe> (mabye still does)

[15:06] <ugexe> this is higher than the version of the stand alone Perl6::TypeGraph

[15:06] <antoniogamiz> noisegul: can you check if you have the correct version of Perl6::TypeGraph? I have public 0.0.3 right now

[15:06] <antoniogamiz> s/public/puslbished

[15:07] <antoniogamiz> published*

[15:07] <ugexe> the module was found in zef's local cache -- so if p6doc no longer includes that module then it is finding an older version that used to (but is still higher version than your module)

[15:07] <ugexe> `zef nuke StoreDir` will clear zef's cache

[15:07] <antoniogamiz> ugexe: thanks for your help, I have updated everything and all problems are solved :D

[19:06] <[Coke]> note that my input to the second process is the output of a proc::async - in your example it's the result of a file open.

[19:07] <TreyHarris> Not an answer to the question, but should we be using the term "stdout" in the docs like that? Rather than "standard output" or `$*OUT`?

[19:11] <[Coke]> stdout is literally the name of the method I'm calling, so it's fine in that regard. (it's output from perl6, not in the docs)

[19:13] <TreyHarris> Oh, I found it in Type/X/Proc/Async/TapBeforeSpawn.pod6 so I thought it was in the published doc

[19:14] <TreyHarris> All clear now.

[19:28] <ugexe> that output comes from where

[19:28] <ugexe> and it sure sounds like its coming from a pipe

[19:29] <ugexe> s/where/somewhere/

[19:30] <AlexDaniel> Where should we move old RT tickets? Disagree now! https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/49#issuecomment-511953136

[19:31] <ugexe> IO::Pipe doesn't have a close method anyway, so ignore me

[19:34] <ugexe> calling .close-stdin works for me though

[19:34] <ugexe> m: my $proc = Proc::Async.new($*EXECUTABLE.absolute, "-e", "say(42)"); my $proc2 = Proc::Async.new($*EXECUTABLE.absolute, "-e", "say $*IN", :stdout); $proc2.bind-stdin(my $stdout = $proc2.stdout); $proc.start; $proc2.start; $proc2.close-stdin

[19:35] <ugexe> nevermind again, i didnt see the error blaring in my face

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> or maybe I should just start a PR right away, so that later people don't complain that they were not askedâ¦ :)

[20:58] <[Coke]> golfed my open files issue down to rakudo#3057

[20:58] <synopsebot> RAKUDO#3057 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3057 "too many open files" when repeatedly using Proc::Async

[20:58] <[Coke]> I'd appreciate it if someone could try it on a slightly newer perl6 on something other than os x

[21:02] <ugexe> [Coke]: on OSX your golf doesn't stop for me

[21:02] <El_Che> [Coke]: Ubuntu 18.04, latest release rakudo from rakudo-pkg (2019.03.1): still running at 850

[21:03] <El_Che> ok, it stops at 1010

[21:03] <El_Che> Unhandled exception in code scheduled on thread 6

[21:03] <El_Che> too many open files

[21:03] <ugexe> ah my ulimit is unlimited

[21:03] <El_Che> too many open files$ ulimit -n

[21:03] <El_Che> 1024

[21:04] <El_Che> 1024 in my case, makes sense to stop there

[21:22] <DrForr> Does anyone know offhand if there's a NativeCall module using a .a file on modules?

[21:24] <timotimo> can you actually just load those without linking them into a .so or similar?

[21:24] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:25] <timotimo> i think an .a file is an archive file of a bunch of .o files?

[21:25] *** veesh left
[21:25] <DrForr> Could very well be. I was just wondering if there were already prior art.

[21:26] <timotimo> might first have to implement your own ld, then write it to a file and then load it with nativecall

[21:27] <DrForr> Which is to say "moving on..." :)

[21:27] <El_Che> DrForr: I can be mistaken, but I think this uses .a as intermediary: https://github.com/azawawi/perl6-inline-go

[21:27] <DrForr> Nice, I'll take a look.

[21:33] <DrForr> It'd be nicer if I could get a proper .so file but what can ye do...

[21:40] *** MasterDuke joined
[21:43] <MasterDuke> in [Coke]'s example, should @!close-after-exit have something in it here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Proc/Async.pm6#L355 ? 

[21:46] <timotimo> it only seems to be added when bind-stdin is used for stuff

[21:46] <MasterDuke> his example does

[21:46] <timotimo> OK, i hadn't looked at thaty et

[21:47] <MasterDuke> `$b.bind-stdin: $a.stdout: :bin;`

[21:47] <MasterDuke> or alternately, should https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Proc/Async.pm6#L234 be copied into the other multi?
