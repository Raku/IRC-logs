[01:30] <eno> can anyone help me with an error I'm getting while trying to install a compiled version of perl6

[01:30] <eno> this is the error:

[01:30] <eno> perl6-m tools/build/install-core-dist.p6 /gnu/store/qp5w8m517cfbi5lc30g8127ss92d2ycs-rakudo-2018.12/share/perl6/No writeable path found, /gnu/store/qp5w8m517cfbi5lc30g8127ss92d2ycs-rakudo-2018.12/share/perl6 not writeable  in block <unit> at tools/build/install-core-dist.p6 line 28

[01:30] <eno> and here is what is in install-core-dist.p6

[01:31] <eno> $*REPO.install(    Distribution::Hash.new(        {            name     => "CORE",            auth     => "perl",            ver      => $*PERL.version.Str,            provides => %provides,        },        prefix => $*CWD,    ),    :force,);

[01:31] *** zacts left
[01:32] <eno> for some reason $*REPO.install says the dir is not writable when it is running as root

[01:32] <eno> btw, this is coming from the Makefile in the rakudo repo

[01:33] <eno> line 641

[01:34] <Xliff> eno: Can you check the permissions on those directories?

[01:35] <Xliff> Worst comes to worse, you can make them world-writable and see if that fixes the error.

[01:35] <Home> is there any way to run perl6 on windows 10 and get the libraries that need gmake, like cro?

[01:36] <eno> ls -la /gnu/store/qp5w8m517cfbi5lc30g8127ss92d2ycs-rakudo-2018.12/share/total 16drwxr-xr-x  4 guixbuilder1 guixbuild 4096 Jan 17 18:13 .drwxr-xr-x  4 guixbuilder1 guixbuild 4096 Jan 17 18:13 ..drwxr-xr-x  3 guixbuilder1 guixbuild 4096 Jan 17 18:13 nqpdrwxr-xr-x 12 guixbuilder1 guixbuild 4096 Jan 17 18:13 perl6

[01:36] <eno> thats messy

[01:36] <eno> drwxr-xr-x 12 guixbuilder1 guixbuild 4096 Jan 17 18:13 perl6

[01:37] <eno> guixbuilder is running the build

[01:37] <eno> all the other perl install commands work except for the $*REPO.install

[01:38] <eno> I'm not that familiar with the perl6 module system so I'm kinda stuck

[01:40] <eno> "Worst comes to worse, you can make them world-writable and see if that fixes the error." this is an automated build script so it's hard to make changes in the middle of the make install process

[01:48] <eno> does anybody know how $*REPO.install works and the types of permissions it needs? The Makefile shouldn't be failing

[01:49] <eno> even if i run the command manually as root it still gives me a permission error

[10:17] <ufobat> anyone intersted in maintaining https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-Temp-Path ?

[10:17] <ufobat> ;)

[10:19] <robertle> I actively use it, so I could look after it as well

[10:20] <ufobat> i've having directories that dont get lost

[10:20] <ufobat> and i think that is because of the issue number 4

[10:21] <ufobat> is there something you need to be aware of when you use Channels in combiation with END phasers?

[10:21] <ufobat> Some exceptions were thrown in END blocks:

[10:21] <ufobat>   X::Channel::SendOnClosed+{X::Await::Died}: Cannot send a message on a closed channel

[10:22] * jmerelo clickbaits https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2575 for some brainstorming on documentation organization.

[10:28] <ufobat> i love the pink/black tags on it, jmerelo :D

[10:29] <jmerelo> ufobat: let's see if they draw everyone's attention...

[10:29] <ufobat> *crosses fingers*

[10:31] <jmerelo> ufobat: I've also used the new "pinning" thing in GitHub to pin this one: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2542

[10:31] <timotimo> you have to be aware that an END block gets registered immediately when the parser finds it

[10:31] <timotimo> so it'll be run even if the scope it's in was never actually called

[10:36] <jmerelo> ufobat: if you are still in your module fixing and creating frenzy, could you take a look at this? https://github.com/perl6-community-modules/uri

[10:38] <ufobat> am i? i am not like mohammad anwar :)

[10:40] <hkdtam> sorry for bothering guys, should any shift result of uint32 also within uint32?

[10:40] <jmerelo> ufobat: Manwar thing is permanent, yours seems to be time-constrained.

[10:41] <jmerelo> ufobat: anyway, you seem to have some issues (literally) there, and it's a community maintained module. That means us.

[10:41] <ufobat> and he is the more skilled guy :-)

[10:41] <ufobat> i am wondering that's going wrong there, the grammar is not matching

[10:41] <ufobat> youre talking about your issue that you've craeted there recently, jmerelo?

[10:42] <ufobat> is it a "released" version or is it HEAD?

[10:42] <jmerelo> ufobat: well, that's one

[10:42] <jnthn> hkdtam: Calculations are done at full width, the size is about the storage

[10:42] <jmerelo> ufobat: but there are issues dating back to 2015

[10:43] <ufobat> the hacktoberfest issues, yeah :)

[10:44] <hkdtam> jnthn: oh thx a lot

[10:45] <jmerelo> ufobat: anyway, if you've got the time, please take a look. I'll keep it in my own backlog (which includes lots of pink-and-black labeled issues in /doc) anyway

[10:46] <ufobat> I'll write it down on my list as well. So far i just send PR to stuff that i was using and didnt work as i wanted it.

[10:49] <jmerelo> ufobat: this URI thing is pretty down the food chain in the ecosystem. It's bound to come up sooner or later. The doc builds, since they happen several times a day, are kind of a canary for the modules it's using, because it's also using HEAD in Rakudo.

[10:51] <ufobat> your issue is just with HEAD?

[10:51] <timotimo> DBDish::SQLite: Error: not an error (17)

[10:51] <timotimo> what fun!

[10:52] <jmerelo> ufobat: not sure. Might be. 

[10:53] <jmerelo> ufobat: it's not been failing so far, so it's likely it is.

[10:53] <ufobat> i dont know (yet) how to have multiple perl6 installations on windows

[10:53] <ufobat> any advice?

[10:54] <jmerelo> ufobat: rakudobrew does not work? Or p6env?

[10:54] <jmerelo> ufobat: I mean, about HEAD, yep, that issue is with HEAD, since that's the binary we use, but the error that produces it need not have been introduced in the last commit.

[10:54] <ufobat> i am not sure, i think rakudobrew does not work because the PATHs need to be fixed in the configuration gui of windows, no?

[10:55] <ufobat> i wasn't aware of p6env

[10:55] <jmerelo> ufobat: No idea. I've been Windows-free since circa 2003.

[10:55] <ufobat> likewise :-)

[12:24] <ufobat> $ prove6 --version does return 0.0.6 for me

[12:24] <ufobat> the current version should return 0.0.3, and thats the case for 1 year now

[12:25] <moritz> it seems that you have a new version installed than was released?

[12:27] <ufobat> i did install it with zef!

[12:27] <ufobat> there is a TAP.0.0.6 in my .zef/ directory

[12:27] <ufobat> 0.0.6 is released on cpan

[12:28] <moritz> then why do you say it should return 0.0.3?

[12:28] <ufobat> becase it is either not leont's module or it is on cpan by accident

[12:29] <ufobat> https://github.com/perl6/tap-harness6/blob/master/bin/prove6#L67 <- that file has not been modified since 1 year

[12:29] <ufobat> the current version of the module is 0.0.4

[12:29] <ufobat> zef search TAP::Harness shows 0.0.6 on cpan

[12:30] <ufobat> and the cpan version (0.0.6) does "test" a file named t/whatever.txt instead of only *.t files

[12:30] <ufobat> thats the reason why perl6-community-modules/uri fails

[12:30] <ufobat> it "tests" this https://github.com/perl6-community-modules/uri/blob/master/t/expected.txt

[12:32] <ufobat> https://modules.perl6.org/dist/TAP:cpan:LEONT <- thats the 0.0.6

[12:33] <moritz> but that's TAP, not TAP::Harness

[12:35] <ufobat> but if you click on the github-repo button you're on tap-harness6.

[12:36] <ufobat> it's the same code, it's just in a different state 

[12:37] <moritz> ah, confusing :/

[12:37] <ufobat> and there is the bug that jjmerelo was getting on uri -> https://modules.perl6.org/dist/TAP:cpan:LEONT/bin/prove6#L11

[14:55] <kudzo> Hello perl community. so I found github thread where https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues/33

[14:57] <kudzo> perl community became too toxic with all this sjw shit.

[14:57] <kudzo> my question now is If you need to move from perl to another language what whould U choose? 

[14:58] <El_Che> kudzo: yes, please do

[14:58] <El_Che> kudzo: choose whatever you like

[14:59] <kudzo> most priorities are fast-development, containerable

[14:59] <jnthn> Choose a language with as few users as possible. Then you won't have any community to worry about. :)

[15:00] <eseyman> I don't know of any language that has avoided "all this sjw shit"

[15:00] <huf> sumerian?

[15:01] <eseyman> plus that specific issue has more or less resolved itself

[15:01] <eseyman> so there is nothing to complain about

[15:01] <eseyman> kudzo: give perl6 a try :-)

[15:02] <kudzo> eseyman, yes but we lost good man because of this issue. And perl6 has chance to become dead faster than become popular.

[15:02] *** kurahaupo left
[15:02] *** kurahaupo joined
[15:03] <pmurias> kudzo: how was the renaming drama sjw related?

[15:03] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo

[15:04] <El_Che> kudzo: I would try Java if I was you. Oracle is still evil, so no chance of whatever Illuminati plot or whatever

[15:05] <kudzo> El_Che, yes. I looking forward kotlin nice lang and U can express your self easily like in perl.

[15:05] <eseyman> pmurias: from experience, sjw doesn't mean anything anymore

[15:05] <El_Che> See you have world of choices, and if they ever get women programmers in that language, you can move on

[15:06] <tyil> El_Che: "sjw bullshit" and "women programmers" existing are two entirely different subjects

[15:07] <tyil> you're not helping anyone by acting like those are the same thing

[15:07] <El_Che> people that use sjw are stupid in my book, same page as people that feel uneasy with women or gay people

[15:07] <El_Che> so, whenever I see SJW used in a sentences my bullshit alarm goes on

[15:08] <tyil> so you have to limit your way of thinking too, and make silly arguments that are in no way beneficial?

[15:08] *** sena_kun left
[15:08] <El_Che> getting read of people that are stupid enough to use the term SJW? A great day

[15:08] <El_Che> rid

[15:09] <tyil> people who dislike the "sjw culture" are in no way related to people who feel uneasy with women or gay people

[15:09] <El_Che> "sjw culture"

[15:09] <El_Che> lol

[15:09] <jnthn> This isn't on-topic here.

[15:09] <tyil> jnthn: good point

[15:09] <tyil> this isn't going anywhere anyway

[15:09] <El_Che> nope

[15:09] <El_Che> someone wants to leave because of SJW? sure, go ahead

[15:09] <El_Che> my 2c

[15:10] <kudzo> El_Che, sorry that I triggered U(;

[15:11] <kudzo> El_Che, The main reason I want to leave language because I dont feel its safe for bussines.

[15:11] <El_Che> Zoffix leaving has nothing to do with SJW

[15:12] <kudzo> El_Che, but because of what? can u explain please ? 

[15:13] <tyil> kudzo: Zoffix left because he no longer had fun working on Perl 6, "I think I need to take a long look at my life and re-evaluate what is in it that actually makes me happy."

[15:14] <El_Che> kudzo: I don't want to reopen the discussion (most of it can be read on the channels logs), but I'll just say there is nothing that can be labelled as SJW (despite on how stupid that label is).

[15:14] <tyil> I do think this could've been avoided, but it already happened, and I'm not a great mediator in any case anyway :'D

[15:14] <El_Che> for the record, I sympathized and voiced my support for Zoffix's efforts (e.g. the renaming/alias thing)

[15:15] <El_Che> and with that, I'll refrain from comments

[15:15] <pmurias> kudzo: the github thread was caused by drama in regards to aliasing/renaming Perl 6 to Raku and not as as far as I know any SJW activity

[15:16] <kudzo> ok why ribasushi left community? 

[15:16] <El_Che> ribasushi was never in the Perl 6 community (that I know of)

[15:17] <El_Che> he's mostly focused on Perl 5

[15:17] <kudzo> I just think perl5 and 6 communities are almost all the same people

[15:17] <El_Che> No, it's not the case

[15:17] <tyil> there's overlap, but they're not all the same

[15:18] <El_Che> Zoffix was only part of perl 6 the last years, riba only of perl 5

[15:18] <tyil> conversely, there's also a subset that hates the other with a passion

[15:18] *** w17t left
[15:19] <El_Che> also, in the case of ribasushi, it's wasn't anything "SJW", he's concerned about perl5 and p5p. He's on the channel, so you can check with him :)

[15:20] <masak> kudzo: you seem to have fallen in with the wrong kind of people, based on your usage of both "sjw" and "trigger" in the past brief exchanges.

[15:20] <masak> kudzo: out of curiosity, does it make sense to you to describe "social justice warrior" as a derogatory term?

[15:21] <masak> do you feel there's too much of a focus on social justice nowadays? :)

[15:21] <pmurias> please don't make sjw support an official stance of the channel :(

[15:21] <El_Che> We have people here from different backgrounds (including gay and trans people) and they need to be treated with respect like everyone else. There is nothing SJW about that. If that's an issue, I think we're missing common ground here.

[15:21] <tyil> pmurias++

[15:21] <kudzo> as for ribasushi I read this https://twitter.com/ribasushi/status/945637302402998273

[15:23] <El_Che> there is no abuse on this channel and no people policing everyone words. So, using SJW in this context is really investing problems that we luckily don't have

[15:23] <eseyman> inappropriate language, fact-free and insulting; yup, that's by ribasushi

[15:24] <kudzo> El_Che, thanks for explanations. I like to take information from first hands not from gossip

[15:24] <El_Che> contact Zoffix if you feel you need more details

[15:25] <El_Che> and again ribasushi's conflict is pretty centered on p5p

[15:25] <b2gills> I think this conversation is running afoul of the culture we want to have: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/specs/master/S27-perl-culture-draft.pod6

[15:25] <masak> the founding member of this channel is transgender, and has transitioned. I always admired how this community embraces people of different backgrounds.

[15:26] <tyil> I had too, until they started censoring talks at the conference

[15:26] <kudzo> El_Che, but all this shit happening in both communities past years makes our company very nervous. We considered to move to perl6 from p5 before january. 

[15:27] <tyil> there's a difference between being respectful to people, and trying to constantly play a victim and have the world change to your wishes

[15:27] <masak> b2gills: as much as I don't disagree with anything in particular in that document, I no longer believe "be reasonable" (its thesis) is enough as a community guideline.

[15:27] <tyil> the first is being a decent human being, the second is being an sjw

[15:27] <b2gills> The person who was "censored" agreed that they shouldn't have said the things they said.

[15:27] <kudzo> tyil, ++

[15:27] <tyil> convincing the person of some insane ideology doesn't mean that ideology is correct now, b2gills 

[15:28] <El_Che> kudzo: I don't know what you're referring to. Communities and not project direction?

[15:28] <eseyman> kudzo: these things happen in all programming communities (and I could remove the word programming here)

[15:28] <tyil> it's also very hard to judge anyway, since nobody is willing to give *any* details on what actually happened

[15:28] <tyil> or what was said that was inappropriate, or how many people complained

[15:28] <El_Che> Besides the naming discussion that returns every six months, I haven't seen much drama inside the perl 6 community

[15:29] <tyil> I do agree with El_Che, the Perl 6 community seems remarkably stable and friendly

[15:29] *** curan left

[15:29] <tyil> but I do hope we can keep it this way, and last year's TPC really made me doubt that for the first time

[15:30] <El_Che> tyil: my last one was 2016, I missed the episode you're referring to

[15:32] <b2gills> tyil: So then as far as you know it could have been the most hateful words to ever come out of anyone's mouth. My guess is the person said something that they didn't realize could be hurtful, and once they found that out they didn't want to be associated with those words anymore.

[15:32] <pmurias> masak: I'm all for embarcing everyone in the community (regardless of their background or whatever horrible right wing or left wings view they hold privately as I don't see how that's relevant towards writing Perl 6 code), I just don't want to have an official ideology

[15:32] <tyil> I don't think this channel is the place for that discussion, b2gills 

[15:33] <tyil> so I'm not going to respond to it

[15:44] <kudzo> Ok! Sorry ppl for disturbing you on all by this questions(: I just needed to fix the information that I got from gossips.

[15:45] <El_Che> kudzo: the discussion is no problem, but be careful with the approach (like I demonstrated, SJW labels are not appreciated).

[15:45] <kudzo> El_Che, ty (;

[15:46] <El_Che> I would have been less sarcastic if I'd known your reasons were not meant as trolling

[15:46] <kudzo> pmurias, python is one of the candidates but not preferable.

[15:46] <El_Che> so excuses for that

[15:46] <kudzo> As for perl6 I think we will give it a try

[15:47] <kudzo> we all here are perl5 fans so perl6 is our candidate n1

[15:49] <kudzo> El_Che, I am from generation that born inside trolling communities. And good sarcasm sometimes can explain much more better than trying to be polite. So nevermind (;

[15:51] <pmurias> tadzik: we currently don't have no language design process for Perl 6 either :(

[19:53] <melezhik> hi! any does any perl6 module exist to merge 2 hashes?

[19:54] <melezhik> similar to https://metacpan.org/pod/Hash::Merge

[19:55] <melezhik> I found something - https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Hash::Merge:cpan:TYIL

[19:55] <melezhik> looks like what I need?

[19:57] <jmerelo> melezhik: Might be. And tyil is around here sometimes, you might ask him.

[19:57] <melezhik> sure

[19:57] <melezhik> will try this module and let see

[20:22] <melezhik> I wonder what hash-merge try to assign? 

[20:23] <Kaiepi> i guess i could just use die

[20:23] <Kaiepi> but it'd be nice if there was an equivalent to pass but for failing a test

[20:35] <melezhik> yes

[20:36] <melezhik> how do I access inside class? via $.foo ?

[20:36] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v zakharyas

[20:37] <lizmat> $.foo will use the accessor, so handles subclassing correctly

[20:37] <lizmat> $!foo is direct access to the attribute, without regards to subclassing

[20:37] <lizmat> $.foo is syntactic sugar for self.foo

[20:37] <timotimo> self.foo.item

[20:38] <timotimo> ^- this sometimes catches people off guard

[20:38] <lizmat> timotimo: good point :-)

[20:38] <lizmat> although...  eh... why ?

[20:38] <lizmat> because of the sigil ?

[20:38] <timotimo> yeah

[20:38] <lizmat> wouldn't that already be an item *without* the .item ?

[20:39] <melezhik> Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value

[20:39] <timotimo> yes

[20:39] *** jmerelo left
[20:39] <timotimo> i meant that $.foo is equivalent to self.foo.item

[20:39] <melezhik> $.task-config = %( foo => 100 );

[20:39] <melezhik> class Runner { has Hash $.task-config is rw }

[20:40] <timotimo> having it be "is rw" means that you can assign new stuff to the attribute itself

[20:40] <melezhik> which I do

[20:40] <timotimo> OK

[20:40] <melezhik> through $.task-config = %( foo => 100 );

[20:41] <timotimo> right

[20:41] <melezhik> and it throws Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value

[20:41] <timotimo> can you golf that?

[20:41] <lizmat> m: class A { has Hash $.b is rw }; my $a = A.new; $a.b = %( a => 42 ); dd $a
