[00:15] <sena_kun> please note `|` in call.

[00:15] <sena_kun> like, `say(abc(|%mode.pick));`.

[00:15] <atweiden-air> ok

[00:15] <atweiden-air> thanks

[00:16] <sena_kun> the reason is that in a hash you store pairs, so when you pick one, it tries to pass a Pair there

[00:16] <sena_kun> to pass it as a named argument, you need to "decontainerize" it.

[00:16] <sena_kun> which can be done using `|`. another option will be...

[00:18] <sena_kun> hmm, I am not sure about another option, but I hope that helps. please ask if there is anything unclear. :)

[00:18] <atweiden-air> yes, it does https://gist.github.com/atweiden/23c881c066d2a5aafecd2378f5f4c2ab

[00:20] *** yqt joined
[00:20] <sena_kun> oops, I need to re-learn that... https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#index-entry-parameter_%7C-Capture_parameters <- docs here say that `|` converts parameter into Capture, which is different from deconteinerization. :( Well, as Capture is a something that represents routine arguments, once again, it converts a Pair into something that might be passed into a routine as a named arg.

[00:21] * sena_kun memoized hiragana the hard way using drag-n-drop. :)

[00:22] * atweiden-air was there

[00:22] * atweiden-air saw flash

[00:22] <sena_kun> hehe

[00:23] <sena_kun> well, it was like around two years ago from now, can say it becomes very natural with some practice. atweiden-air just out of curiosity, have you started recently or not so?

[00:23] <atweiden-air> very recently

[00:23] <sena_kun> not flash though, but hiragana.

[00:25] <sena_kun> atweiden-air, oh, good luck and I wish you a lot of perseverance. If any advices wanted: wanikani every single day at least twice does a miracle and totally worth it(no, I didn't get paid for this).

[00:26] <sena_kun> but back to Perl 6, atweiden-air, are you just trying out various stuff from Perl 6 syntax to learn or want some tips on how to make the script less "official"?

[00:26] * sena_kun probably the first one, but just in case

[00:27] <sena_kun> s/probably/guesses/

[00:28] <atweiden-air> in this case, i wanted to avoid flash; did it in about 10 mins

[00:28] <atweiden-air> i have some more extensive p6 scripts at github.com/atweiden

[00:29] <atweiden-air> sena_kun: thanks for the wanikani recommendation; wish i had heard of it before buying skritter for 2 yrs

[00:30] *** rindolf left
[00:31] <sena_kun> atweiden-air, I have no longer studying kanji(though probably have to, lol, but anyway too lazy when can read books and stuff) and hearing first time about skritter service, but I guess anything with SRS and some kanji order presence does the job with enough time investment. Even e.g. Anki.

[00:38] <atweiden-air> about to buy lifetime membership i think

[00:41] <sena_kun> unfortunately, I don't think so, sorry. :( I have used montly payment and haven't recieved any promo codes. they have a three level trial and I _highly_ recommend firstly go through it fully, to check if that's "your" thing, because an advice of some random person(such as me) over the internet is cool, but everyone is still different.

[00:41] *** rindolf left
[00:42] <sena_kun> and it depends on your goals, I think. It doesn't teach you a big about stroke order and handwriting, so if your goal is to recognize && be able to read stuff - that's one thing. If you want to write using pen&paper... Wanikani is not really useful.

[01:06] <Xliff> At least enough to be able to listen to it.

[01:06] <sena_kun> Xliff, how can I be helpful? :)

[01:07] <Xliff> What would be the best tool to use to accomplish that?

[01:07] <Xliff> Would Wanikani work for me?

[01:07] <Xliff> I actually have SOME experience with Hiragana.

[01:07] <Xliff> Kanji? Not so much.

[01:09] <sena_kun> Xliff, well, listening depends on what do you want to listen to. Some cool lectures on hard topics? Some schoolgirls chatting in some random anime? Real-life talking?

[01:09] <Xliff> Anime, mostly. :)

[01:09] <sena_kun> Xliff, well... :]

[01:09] <sena_kun> I am here between a golfed script and hexchat, give me a minute please...

[01:31] <sena_kun> https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/1555ae3a5c231be676b2e80a60b30efd <- not super-short, but I tried.

[01:32] <sena_kun> I wish I could inline `@map `definition too into previous line, but it seems I miss something about unpacking of positionals.

[01:32] <sena_kun> and this last `$q. $a` is totally cheating, as in original script it shows an index to user...

[01:33] <sena_kun> Xliff, mind if I pm you?

[01:37] <Xliff> Not at all! :)

[01:38] <leont> Ran into another ¬´Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)¬ª

[01:39] <Xliff> sena_kun: Shouldn't %HIRAGANA.pick.map be %HIRAGANA.pairs.pick.map?

[01:40] <sena_kun> Xliff, why?

[01:40] <sena_kun> %HIRAGANA is already a Hash and Hash has pick implemented.

[01:40] <sena_kun> so no need to convert to an array of Pairs, I think.

[01:41] <Xliff> Oh! I am looking at the docs and they don't mention pick!

[11:07] <tadzik> ufobat_: sure thing

[11:07] <ufobat_> thanks :D tadzik++

[11:08] <ufobat_> a comment on that https://github.com/tadzik/Shell-Command/issues/20 would be awesome

[11:08] <ufobat_> i am currently on windows and I am reimplementing those 2 lines over and over again

[11:10] <ZZZzz___> Hello Everybody. Short question about defining a list of hashes containing lists of hashes. This is what I came up with: https://pastebin.com/XGnECTpV

[11:10] <ZZZzz___> When iterating over the hashes in key-list it seems that the whole first hash is taken as a key for the second one. What I intended was that key-list contains two hashes. How do I accomplish that? 

[11:11] <tadzik> ufobat_: sounds like a good fit imho. It's not a shell command on linux, but from the looks of it it seems to be one on windows :)

[11:11] <tadzik> if it makes the module more useful then I'm all for it, to hell with purity :P

[11:11] <ufobat_> woho! \o/

[11:13] <ufobat_> i am not sure what you want to do, ZZZzz___ 

[11:14] <ufobat_> the key-list, is a list, there are no "keys" there are indexes

[11:14] <ZZZzz___> @list is supposed to be a list of hashes. each of those hashes should hold a list of hashes in key 'key-list'.

[11:16] <ufobat_> ZZZzz___ say @list[0]<key-list>[0]; # numer: 1, name: joe

[11:16] <ufobat_> aye

[11:17] <ufobat_> @list[0] is a hash, @list[0]<key-list> takes the list again, and then with [0] you get the hash {'number' => 1, 'name' => joe}

[11:19] <ZZZzz___> but for @list -> %h1 {

[11:19] <ZZZzz___>     for %h1{"key-list"} -> %h2 {

[11:19] <ZZZzz___>         say %h2;

[11:19] <ZZZzz___>     }

[11:19] <ZZZzz___> }

[11:19] <ZZZzz___> yields Type check failed in binding to parameter '%h2'; expected Associative but got Array ($[{:name("joe"), :num...)

[11:20] *** reach_satori joined
[11:21] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v reach_satori

[11:21] <ZZZzz___> Seems I am using 'for' incorrectly. for @(%h1{"key-list"}) -> %h2 seems to do the trick!

[11:22] <Altreus> tyil: right on :)

[11:22] <ufobat_> ahh

[11:22] <Altreus> 'cept it didn't work ü§î

[11:22] <tyil> works for me

[11:22] <ZZZzz___> and for me

[11:23] <jnthn> ZZZzz___: Yes, it's because hash values are considered items, and `for` doesn't iterate an item

[11:23] <yoleaux> 07:51Z <nine> jnthn: http://niner.name/files/inline-issue/master.log.gz vs. http://niner.name/files/inline-issue/patched.log.gz

[11:23] <yoleaux> 07:54Z <nine> jnthn: To reproduce run: `time perl6 csv-ip5xs.pl < /tmp/hello.csv` from Tux' CSV repository and compare Inline-Perl5's master branch to the inline-demonstration branch (1 commit difference). I do not think that it's JIT related. Feels more like inlining will push the inliner's size over the inline limit and we'd benefit from that much more. Or so.

[11:23] <jnthn> ZZZzz___: Another way is to put [] on the end rather than wrapping it up

[11:23] <tyil> if you have vim views enabled, it may ignore it on consecutive opens, Altreus 

[11:24] <tyil> Altreus: you also need to have modeline enabled in vim, which I thought was default

[11:24] <ZZZzz___> Thank you all very much for your input!

[11:24] <ufobat_> but woudn't it be simple to put a | infront of the %h1<key-list>

[11:24] <ufobat_> ?

[11:24] <ufobat_> simpler

[11:25] <Altreus> I thought so too

[11:25] <Altreus> it might be being overridden by the au I have in my vimrc maybe

[11:25] <Altreus> but you'd think modeline would win

[11:26] <ufobat_> ZZZzz___, yup for |%h1{"key-list"} -> %h2 { works too

[11:26] <ZZZzz___> ufobat_, I like this one even better. Thanks!

[15:09] <andrzejku> I want to write an SDL game for kid is it possible to run Perl6 on Android?

[15:14] <timotimo> andrzejku: on the moarvm backend you won't have a jit unless the device is an x86-64, so performance won't be very good i'm afraid

[15:20] <daxim> m: my $r = role { has Int $.x; }; my $foo-thing = Any.new but $r; $foo-thing.^name = 'Foo::some-dynamic-name-under-user-supplied-namespace-Foo'; dd $foo;   # how to rebless?

[15:20] <andrzejku> timotimo I remmember you was working on Perl6 SDL

[15:20] <timotimo> aye

[15:21] <andrzejku> timotimo what's the state now?

[15:21] <timotimo> it works. i don't have a very shiny example but that's only because i'm not good at game development or art :)

[15:23] <andrzejku> timotimo ahh

[15:23] *** silug left
[15:23] <andrzejku> timotimo the problem is that my kid is small

[15:23] <andrzejku> he is only 3 y old and he have a problem with mouse

[15:23] <andrzejku> has*

[15:24] <andrzejku> but on tablet it is eathier to tap with finger

[15:24] <timotimo> OK, if there is no need for high speed and fast reaction times, that should be totally fine

[15:26] <timotimo> you could also investigate how well rakudo.js works in the browser of the device you've got

[15:26] <andrzejku> mm yes but as I understand I have to compile moarvm with arm compiler?

[15:27] <timotimo> yeah, the android NDK should come with everything you need i'd assume

[15:27] *** jme` left
[15:27] <andrzejku> ok :O

[15:27] <timotimo> when using SDL you'll have to draw every frame manually, but when you have an engine - which in this case can be the browser - you'll only have to do business logic for high-level behaviour and the frame-by-frame work is done by the engine

[15:28] <andrzejku> timotimo I am not fan of browser

[15:28] <andrzejku> it is trap for humanity

[15:28] <timotimo> fair enough

[15:29] <sena_kun> andrzejku, while unrelated to programming, I have to warn you that screens are not totally safe for children as they increase risk of severe vision issues later in life(while adults are affected less strongly). Running Perl 6 on Android is a great thing on its own thuogh. :)

[15:29] <timotimo> it should be possible to make a gdnative thing to work with rakudo, i.e. use rakudo with godot

[15:29] <andrzejku> timotimo well ok :-) I will think about that

[15:29] <andrzejku> sena_kun Ya I heard about that

[15:30] <andrzejku> sena_kun but I was also a display kid I should say that the times and I was playing games is better then to drink vodka

[15:31] <andrzejku> vodka is much worse than screens

[15:32] <sena_kun> andrzejku, it likely is, just wanted to note as health comes first. :)

[15:33] <timotimo> if your 3 year old would start drinking vodka if you don't let them use the android tablet, i think something might be going wrong %)

[15:33] <timotimo> just kidding, of course

[15:33] <andrzejku> timotimo :-D

[15:34] <andrzejku> timotimo maybe we have to start work on something like e-paper number games etc. for small kids

[15:34] <andrzejku> which not damage their vision

[16:32] * AlexDaniel wonders if there was any better way to do it‚Ä¶

[16:32] <dpk> woah

[16:32] <[ptc]> omfg

[16:33] <dpk> apparently ChanServ isn't aware that you can voice/devoice up to (iirc) four people with one MODE command

[16:33] <AlexDaniel> dpk: it accepts a bunch of nicks but then splits them by itself anyway‚Ä¶ weird stuff

[16:34] <Kaiepi> am i nuts for writing code like this? https://hastebin.com/erirevuhas.rb

[16:34] <AlexDaniel> dpk: oh wait, MODE command?

[16:35] <AlexDaniel> dpk: I mean, there's probably a way to do it‚Ä¶

[16:35] <dpk> i mean the IRC MODE command, not a/the ChanServ MODE command

[16:35] <sena_kun> Kaiepi, it depends. If that's "end user" application code, I'd say... Probably. If that is _necessary_ "library-writer-side torture" to do magical things for end user... It depends. And in any way, COMMENT THE MEANING. :)

[16:36] <Kaiepi> it's meant for library authors, not end users

[16:36] <Kaiepi> and yeah it definitely needs commenting

[16:37] <sena_kun> if you pour in enough comments and documentation for this piece explaning what is happening at all, then it'd be a less nuts, I guess. :)

[16:45] <melezhik> how to declare class attribute as obligatory?

[16:45] *** reach_satori joined

[16:46] <melezhik> thanks sena_kun:

[16:51] <jmerelo>  m: class A { has $.a is required is rw}; my $new_a = A.new(a=>3); $new_a.a = Nil;

[16:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5b231e099: ( no output )

[16:51] <jmerelo>  m: class A { has $.a is required is rw}; my $new_a = A.new(a=>3); $new_a.a = Nil; say $new_a.perl

[16:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5b231e099: OUTPUT: ¬´A.new(a => Any)‚ê§¬ª

[16:52] <jmerelo> melezhik: so it's compulsory in the sense that you have to provide it when you create the object, but you'll have to check that it's non-null afterwards because the class will not do it for you.

[21:34] <sauvin> AlexDaniel, yea, a common problem.

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: yeah I see something like that too, but I think it'll settle at some point

[21:37] <sauvin> AlexDaniel, does this channel have an -ops channel?

[21:37] <timotimo> we don't have anything like that to my knowledge

[21:38] <sauvin> I was kinda hoping to huddle with some of the ops to discuss spam mitigation measures.

[21:38] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: there's #perl6-dev but no ops channel

[21:39] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: is it still an issue? It was quiet for a few days even though the bot was practically not doing anything

[21:40] <zachk> i've seen like two spammers on freenode in the last month and one got banned fast by the freenode auto ban system on spam 

[21:40] *** patrickb left
[21:40] <sauvin> Spam has been something of a waxing/waning net-wide nuisance for some time now. A number of channels have imposed restrictions in an effort to curtail it, such as requiring identification to nickserv before being allowed to enter the channel.

[21:40] <sauvin> (fsov "some time now")

[21:43] <Kaiepi> i'm not seeing any atm since i'm not running it on head anymore but it was trying to allocate 1.5GB of memory in 30 seconds

[21:43] *** dataangel joined
[21:45] <timotimo> well, i'm on head, it's now at 311 megabytes

[21:45] <timotimo> it surely isn't from precompilation for example, right?

[21:45] <Kaiepi> it does

[21:46] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: so the way p6bannerbot worked was like this

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: +m so that only voiced can speak, +z so that ops see messages of those who don't have voice

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: p6bannerbot bots gived voice like a minute after you join

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> if you spoke earlier, you're a spammer :)

[21:48] *** |oLa| joined
[21:48] <pmurias> I think the wait time was smaller then a minute

[21:48] <AlexDaniel> 45 seconds

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> https://github.com/zoffixznet/perl6-banbot/blob/master/bot.p6#L29

[21:49] <pmurias> I guess our measures worked mostly because they weren't used network wide

[21:49] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: so the assumption is that normal users wouldn't send a message that fast‚Ä¶ which was actually correct most of the time. Most.

[21:50] <AlexDaniel> and yes, pmurias is right

[21:50] <sauvin> I've considered installing a twit filter in my own channel: anybody who utters anything more than X times per minute is a flapjaw and needs to be removed.

[21:50] <AlexDaniel> I guess they were banned on other channels and got kicked off the server entirely

[21:50] <AlexDaniel> but that measure worked extremely well for #perl6

[21:51] <sauvin> THere's a bot called sigyn that automatically bans or klines spammers.

[21:51] <timotimo> 314 megs

[21:51] <sauvin> I believe it can be invited into the channel. Freenode staff runs it.

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> sauvin: it used to be here, I think. It does ban bots very well :D

[21:52] <timotimo> Kaiepi: is heaptrack available on your platform?

[21:52] <sauvin> Why is it gone?

[21:52] <pmurias> sauvin: I would guess the banning bots part

[21:52] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure. Does it have to be on the channel at all times to do its work?

[21:53] <timotimo> i'd expect it to have to be, yeah

[21:53] <sauvin> It can't react to what it can't see.

[21:53] <AlexDaniel> mst: so we're curious, where's sigyn?

[21:54] <timotimo> i'd expect we have asked for it to be removed?

[21:54] <timotimo> it's still online

[21:54] <mst> sigyn wanders off after 30 days of no hits

[21:54] <timotimo> 316 megs by now

[21:54] <mst> any op can re-invite her though

[21:56] <AlexDaniel> I see. Thanks!

[21:57] <Kaiepi> heaptrack?

[21:57] <Kaiepi> doesn't look like it

[21:59] *** _isomorphismes left
[21:59] <mst> AlexDaniel: basically if we get hit again, try a /invite as +o, if that doesn't work, poke me, if *that* doesn't work, cry in #freenode and blame me

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> mst: OK, thanks. fwiw I can also get p6bannerbot back up when needed, it seemed to do its thing for us

[22:00] <mst> yeah, that was a neat hack, I seriously considered using it in #perl

[22:02] <mst> (and I suspect you're right that being weird helped save us, I've seen spambots optimised to e.g. not trigger sigyn if they're started in a particular mode, we just weren't a big enough target to develop mitigations against our defenses)

[23:33] <Kaiepi> timotimo, i tried using ktrace and for some reason it *doesn't* panic while i'm running it

[23:34] <timotimo> ha

[23:34] <timotimo> fantastic

[23:43] <El_Che> In what world do we live in where ktrace does not panic? Doesn't anyone think of the children?

[23:48] *** dataangel joined
[23:51] <Kaiepi> 77662 mmap calls and 370558 futex calls from moar over the 30 seconds i had the bot running

[23:51] <Kaiepi> is that bad?

[23:52] <Kaiepi> that's all that stood out from the logs

[23:53] <timotimo> futex calls could come from locking/unlocking sockets perhaps? though that probably doesn't happen with async sockets, though they do use the message queue to transfer received/sent message data to the user code threads

[23:54] <timotimo> the mmap calls could be any number of things, including the jit acquiring memory to put bytecode into

[23:54] <timotimo> and any individual allocation that's "too big", like probably the bigger pages of the gen2 as well as the Fixed Size Allocator
