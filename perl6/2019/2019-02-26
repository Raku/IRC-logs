[00:41] <hythm> is it possible to customize the validation of an assignment operation? for instance if I have my Int @a, this will allow only Int to be stored in @a, is it possible to customize this further to make it only accept adding two items at once ( @a.append: 1, 2  # works), (@a.append: 1 # fails)

[00:42] <timotimo> not that i know

[06:34] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: there's been a breaking change in zef. The location of the files has changed. Now no old versions of zef will get updated with the new stuff in the repos

[06:41] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/289

[06:42] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: and this is one of the issues I have with the modules stuff, which apparently can only be handled by people that are personally certified and declared Experts by someone.

[06:43] <adu> And thus begins perl6 certification

[06:47] <jmerelo> Apparently, the problem is simply that those indices take some time to update, both of them. 

[06:49] <jmerelo> I also have an issue with that... When you click in some newly announced distro in Twitter, it's not there yet because the update cycle is 12 hours. 

[07:13] *** reach_satori left

[07:16] <jmerelo> Other than comma, is there any other editor that runs directly Perl 6 code?

[07:17] *** reach_satori joined
[07:19] <moritz> I don't quite understand this question. Comma doesn't run Perl 6 code itself, it invokes rakudo

[07:19] <moritz> so do vim, emacs and the likes

[07:19] <discord6> <Rogue> you can configure a lot of command-line editors to run code like that

[07:19] <jmerelo> How does emacs invoke rakudo?

[07:20] <jmerelo> moritz: I meant load a file, click on "run", run the code. I don't know how to do that with emacs or atom. It's probably some easy thing to do, but I haven't figured it out yet...

[07:22] <moritz> jmerelo: I don't know about emacs, in vim you do something like  imap <F5> <Esc>:w<CR>:!clear;perl6 %<CR>

[07:22] <moritz> to bind the F5 key to run the code for you (and save first, that's the :w)

[07:26] <adu> What's comma?

[09:42] <masak> Xliff: you're aware that you can also do random experimentation via privmsg with camelia, right?

[09:42] <Xliff> NQPRoutine is a thing I am running into.

[09:43] <masak> Xliff: it's down on the nqp layer. AFAIK it's not exposed.

[09:43] <Xliff> masak: You have asked this question before. My response was a simple "Yes".¬†Please do not ask again when you KNOW the answer.

[09:43] <Xliff> masak: And my point is yes it is'

[09:43] <Xliff> Cannot resolve caller ACCEPTS(Routine:U: NQPRoutine); none of these signatures match:

[09:44] <Xliff> Hence my PUBLIC experimentation with camelia, which EVERYONE does.

[09:44] <Xliff> So how did I get that error message from Rakudo without a "use nqp", praytell?

[09:46] <lizmat> Xliff: one possibility: something in NQP is calling Perl 6 and passes on something from NQP that Perl 6 doesn't know about

[09:47] <lizmat> we would need a full --ll-exception backtrace to figure out why

[09:47] <lizmat> Xliff: can you create a gist of the problem ?

[09:48] <Xliff> lizmat: A gist? Yes. A test case or golf? Not at the moment.

[09:49] <lizmat> can you gist a stacktrace  ?]

[09:49] <lizmat> :-)

[09:49] <masak> Xliff: public experimentation with camelia is fine, I guess. we can't be super-sensitive to it. bit it's also _kind_ to do the initial experimentation privately, and then publicly share the result

[09:49] <masak> Xliff: I was reminding you of that. sorry if I came off snarky.

[09:51] <Xliff> masak: Yet I see you active and the only time I see you make that admonishment is when I do it.

[09:52] <Xliff> The channel is not active at the moment. I had a test case I thought would work straight off the bat. It didn't,.

[09:52] <Xliff> All I ask is that you be consistent and either stop doing it or admonish everyone else.

[09:56] *** kurahaupo_ left
[09:56] <masak> Xliff: you may feel like you're the only one I've reminded. you're not.

[09:57] *** kurahaupo joined
[09:57] * lizmat likes to remind everyone here she's still waiting for a gist to look at  :-)

[09:58] <Xliff> lizmat: And here it is https://gist.github.com/Xliff/b4c5b6c100d8aba52d54d31e809b5777

[09:59] <Xliff> masak: I'll take you at your words, but I may go to the channel logs and check for myself.

[10:00] <Xliff> But until then, I'd appreciate it if you'd back off.

[10:04] <lizmat> Xliff: I'd say the my $c = callframe($nf).code; produces a $c that is a NQPRoutine

[10:04] <Xliff> lizmat: Yes, I'd agree.

[10:04] <Xliff> And up until now...surprisingly... that hasn't been a problem.

[10:05] <lizmat> hmmm... there was a trick to detect that, we use that somewhere in core

[10:05] <Xliff> The line in question that triggers the error is here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/lib/GTK/Roles/Protection.pm6#L9

[10:06] <lizmat> brb&

[10:07] <Xliff> cbwood@cbwood-VirtualBox2:~/Projects/rakudobrew/moar-master$ find . -name \*.pm -exec grep -Hn NQPRoutine {} \;

[10:07] <Xliff> o_O

[10:08] <Xliff> Er. That command returns no results, hence my surprise.

[10:08] <Xliff> Neither does cbwood@cbwood-VirtualBox2:~/Projects/rakudobrew/moar-master$ find . -name \*.pm -exec grep -Hn NQPRoutine {} \;

[10:13] <Xliff> my knowhow NQPRoutine { ... }

[10:13] <Xliff> That means it'

[10:13] <Xliff> That means it's not a class, or a package, correct?

[10:13] <Xliff> What is a knowhow?

[10:14] <Xliff> It's got methods, so let's assume it's something specific to nqp

[10:18] <Xliff> Although I hope .^can is supported by NQPRoutine

[16:43] <patrickb> I'm asking because breaks on my machine with moar 2018.12. That release did not have timotimos CStruct change, but NativeHelpers-Blob already uses the new repr because of the above check.

[16:43] <timotimo> yeah, sorry, that just got reverted

[16:43] <timotimo> the cstruct internals change

[16:47] <patrickb> timotimo: I don't understand.

[16:48] <timotimo> i think you may actually want ~~ for version comparison involving * or + or what have you

[16:48] <patrickb> I wanted to find out if the check here: https://github.com/salortiz/NativeHelpers-Blob/blob/master/lib/MoarVM/Guts/REPRs.pm6#L60 is wrong or the comparison logic...

[16:48] *** grayrider left
[16:48] <timotimo> i believe letters after a dot will be considered "before" (like rc5) and numbers "after" (like 2018.12.2) and i suppose *+ falls under "not numbers, so letters"

[16:50] *** comborico1611 joined
[16:53] <patrickb> So given the next release (2019.02?) will also not have the changed cstruct repr, the check should probably be: `$*VM.version > v2019.2` right?

[16:55] <patrickb> Wait, but that revert did not revert the cstruct order, only the other thing in your commit.

[16:55] *** kurahaupo_ left
[16:56] <patrickb> So the correct check in NativeHelpers-Blob should be: $*VM.version >= v2019.2

[16:59] <bolshoi> Hi TimToady

[17:01] <bolshoi> Is Perl6 going to have a name that is not Perl6?

[17:01] *** vrurg left
[17:02] <sena_kun> "Raku" is accepted as an alias(not a complete rename).

[17:02] <jmerelo> .seen timtoady

[17:02] <yoleaux> I saw TimToady 12 Nov 2018 16:33Z in #perl6: * TimToady is officially back from vacation, but completely trashed due to helping SoCal family deal with wildfire evacuations (nothing of ours burnt down, thankfully), and now I get to breathe all the smoke in NorCal, so it's gonna be a while before I'm back in sync enough to act like a BDFL...and maybe that's a good thing :)

[17:02] <jmerelo> bolshoi: so short answer, no.

[17:02] <bolshoi> Raku is japanese?

[17:03] <bolshoi> TimToady was studying japanese

[17:03] <sena_kun> you might look at it this way, I think. :)

[17:03] <bolshoi> last time I checked

[17:03] *** vrurg joined
[17:04] <sena_kun> I am not sure it was the intention all the way, but, at the very least, we have a working compiler called "Rakudo", so.

[17:04] <bolshoi> yep

[17:04] <sena_kun> but there is also https://jisho.org/word/%E6%A5%BD <- of course.

[17:05] <bolshoi> very interesting

[17:06] <bolshoi> https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/raku-2746086

[17:06] * sena_kun .oO ( and now I can lamely pun about Raku... Go )

[17:06] <bolshoi> Raku generally refers to a type of low-firing process that was inspired by traditional Japanese raku firing

[17:07] <patrickb> PR created.

[17:07] <bolshoi> not having a number in it speeds up writing on the terminal and calling the program ;)

[17:07] <bolshoi> also raku would be short and easy

[17:07] <bolshoi> I liked it

[17:13] * jmerelo thinks that's unlikely.

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: where are you getting that ‚Äúno‚Äù answer

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> we didn't have any infrastructure to make a proper decision and agree on it

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> now we will have it on https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> whether it will make ‚ÄúRaku‚Äù as a name more useful or not, I don't know

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> but the short answer is definitely not ‚Äúno‚Äù, it's ‚Äúwe're working on it‚Äù

[17:27] * jmerelo still thinks that a new name is unlikely

[17:27] <AlexDaniel> your pessimism is irrelevant

[17:31] *** dakkar left
[17:32] <jmerelo> However, I've been wrong in the past, so it might stick after all. Who knows.

[18:48] <discord6> <Rogue> In my opinion, we should try to adopt it as it will solve the "getting perl 5 answers on searches" problem, plus I'm just lazy and find it hard to constant explain to people that Perl 6 is not a daughter language to PErl 5

[18:48] <discord6> <Rogue> constantly*

[18:49] <jmerelo> Rogue: it's a sister language

[18:49] <discord6> <Rogue> right, but for the unitiated it sounds like a close successor, which it isn't

[18:49] <discord6> <Rogue> uninitiated*

[18:50] <jmerelo> Rogue: it's a "your mileage may vary" successor.

[18:51] <tadzik> it's a bit of a "It would've been a good idea 15 years ago" imho

[18:51] <jmerelo> As a matter of fact, it's a successor for every other language. A 100-year language.

[18:51] <jmerelo> tadzik: you mean the name?
