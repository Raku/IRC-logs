[02:32] <wtwt5237> hello. I am a perl5 diehard, and I am now seriously thinking about moving to perl6/raku. Could someone give me some insight of whether this will be worth the effort? will raku start to gain popularity one day?

[02:34] <sjn> wtwt5237: it's worth it, in my opinion

[02:35] <sjn> wtwt5237: as for the future, it kinda depends on people like us

[02:35] <wtwt5237> thanks, really want to see raku succeed. but there seems to be a difficult task. also, will raku get faster one day? performance seems to an issue

[02:36] <wtwt5237> yeah, I am a bioinformatician. I want to promote raku in bioinformatics

[02:36] <sjn> if everyone postpones learning (and consequently being able to speak informedly about it) because we're waiting for everyone else to "get it"... nothing's going to happen

[02:37] *** p9s joined
[02:37] <sjn> so asking about popularity (future or present) is fundamentally the wrong question to ask

[02:37] *** p9s left
[02:38] *** aborazmeh left
[02:38] <sjn> if you want to promote Raku, then skip the waiting part, and just dive into it

[02:38] <sjn> in fact, try - just for fun - to implement some bioinformatics tools and libraries in Raku

[02:38] <sjn> this means a few things

[02:39] <sjn> 1) you'll have fun, because learning is fun, and Raku is fun

[02:39] <sjn> 2) you'll hone your bioinformatics skillset in general (which increases your employability and understanding of and within the field)

[02:40] <sjn> 3) you might help the Raku devs finding weak or slow spots in the implementation that they can help optimize

[02:40] <wtwt5237> thx. starting to learn today!

[02:41] <sjn> 4) you'll be able to truthfully share your actual experience and the opinions you build from that, instead of just do some empty hyping

[02:41] <sjn> 5) and, just to repeat myself; you'll have fun. :)

[02:42] *** Cabanossi left
[02:42] <sjn> performance is ok for many things, but there's still lots of things that has room for improvement

[02:43] <sjn> but to identify those bits, the devs need more real-world relevant code

[02:45] <sjn> so if you make something that is actually useful for actual bioinformatics research or computation or [whatever], you can come here later and say "this thing here - it's waay to slow! can you make it finish in faster than 10 seconds? that's how fast it goes when I use the feature-equivalent Python implementation"

[02:45] <sjn> now, *that's* useful feedback

[02:46] <sjn> so please don't wait for what everyone else does, instead proceed having fun and use that to find the bits that needs improving first

[02:47] <sjn> btw, feel free to join the #raku channel :)

[02:47] <wtwt5237> cool. great to see there are still people who are so emotional about "making perl great again":)

[02:47] <sjn> nah, I'm just a bit frustrated about how common your question is :-P
