[00:56] <discord6> <Aearnus> there are only like 3 irc channels i frequent anyway so ahah

[00:56] <Xliff> Yeah. I'll stick with HexChat. It's close to what I was using when I was an OS/2 weenie.

[00:57] <Xliff> Although WeeChat looks nice. No windows version, though.

[00:57] <discord6> <Aearnus> it's a sad state of affairs that there really aren't any good IRC clients

[01:29] <AlexDaniel`> if it works for you :)

[01:30] <uzl> Any idea how the first sentence could be reworded/improved in https://docs.perl6.org/language/functions#sub_nextcallee?

[01:32] <discord6> <Aearnus> uzl: "nextcallee captures and returns the next valid matching candidate. This is the same candidate that would have otherwise been called by nextsame"

[01:36] <uzl> Sorry, I'm kinda of lost. I mean this "Redispatch may be required to call a block that is not the current scope what provides nextsame and friends with the problem to referring to the wrong scope."

[01:36] <aearnus[m]> it's just trying to provide a reason to use nextcallee

[01:38] <aearnus[m]> it could be something more like "In some situations, you might want to save the function that would have been otherwise called through redispatch."

[01:39] <uzl> What I had at first was "Redispatch may be required to call a block that is not the current scope which

[01:39] <uzl> provides nextsame and friends with the problem that refers to the wrong scope."

[01:39] <uzl> I'm not sure if it's technically correct though.

[01:40] <aearnus[m]> hmm

[01:41] *** jaldhar left
[01:41] <aearnus[m]> i mean they're trying to talk about the problem of "let's say you want to use `nextwith`, but you return from the current `multi` block before you want to use `nextwith` -- so you can save the function with `nextcallee` instead"... but the code example doesn't show that

[07:41] <kent\n> "more like changing your family name than your given name -- it's explicitly disavowing the Perl heritage." .. people do this all the time. My mother got married, changed her last name. We still have christmas with what's left of her side of the family :p

[07:43] <kent\n> ( And people who have family names that have poor connotations tend to change them in order to avoid undue persecution. Not many people around these days with the surname "Hitler". Oops, Godwinned it )

[08:08] <moritz> kent\n: there's nothing wrong with doing that, but doing that and at the same time claiming to not want to disavow the heritage, that's just split-brained, IMHO

[08:09] <kent\n> you're not disavowing your heritage when you change your surname to avoid undue persecution. You're avoiding repeated problems due to peoples /perception/ of what it means.

[08:10] <kent\n> I have family members who wish to change both their first name, and their surname, simply due to the repeated problems they have that NOBODY can spell it right, even when the spelling is given to them in hard digital copy.

[08:11] <kent\n> My brother recently applied for an ID card, and it arrived to him, with his name spelled wrong. ( This is in "you had ONE JOB" category )

[08:11] <robertle> perhaps "avoiding persecution" isn't the best analogy 

[08:11] <kent\n> When he filed a complaint, the response to that complaint *also* spelled his name wrong in the reply!

[08:11] <moritz> it's not like spelling "perl" is the problem here

[08:12] *** quester left
[08:12] <kent\n> Yes, sure, not the "spelling" so much. But changing your name != disavowing your ancestry.

[08:12] <kent\n> Ancestry and Heritage are so much more than your name.

[08:13] <moritz> but in this case, it's explicitly to not be perceived to be the Perl heir, to stay with the family analogy

[08:13] <kent\n> The key word is "perceived" 

[08:13] <lizmat> robertle: I think the "avoiding persecution" analogy is very apt

[08:13] <kent\n> Peoples perceptions about words are ... well, not necessarily any reflection of truth.

[08:14] <lizmat> "Nobody ever got fired for choosing Python"

[08:14] <lizmat> In a way, "Perl" is not given a fair chance *because* of its name, be that Perl 5 or Perl 6

[08:15] <kent\n> I mean, if your last name was Hitler, I bet you wouldn't list that fact on any Resume's you put forward to jobs.

[08:15] <lizmat> see Peter Scott's, Curtis Poe comments

[08:15] <kent\n> Doesn't mean you wouldn't still associate with the rest of your family, who probably also had that surname.

[08:15] <robertle> lizmat: yeah, I get that. but just changing the name isn't going to help much, and the Perl 6 needs to prove that it does not accrue the same reputation pretty quick

[08:15] *** jaldhar left
[08:16] *** jaldhar joined
[08:16] <robertle> but I am not arguing against the name change, just that we should avoid words like "divorce" or "prosecution" in this context and frame it a bit more positive

[08:17] <lizmat> I was just trying to get my point across to moritz :-)

[08:17] *** jaldhar left
[08:18] *** jaldhar joined
[08:18] <robertle> yeah. still, I guess we *also* need to focus on making sure we don't repeat Perl 5's reputation-fate under a new name :)

[08:18] <robertle> *another* great name wasted...

[08:18] <lizmat> noted

[08:18] <lizmat> :-)

[08:19] <aearnus[m]> quick, someone register rakumonks.org :P

[08:20] <lizmat> I think the monk analogy has worn out

[08:20] <moritz> and install software from the 1980s there? SCRN

[08:21] <aearnus[m]> lizmat: agreed, the sarcasm didn't come through over IRC

[08:21] <lizmat> sometihing like "cameliakeepers.org" would be better  :-)

[13:28] <Grinnz> I know that almost no Pod6 will be valid Pod because it appears that Pod6 directives are not paragraph based

[13:28] <Grinnz> but I'm not sure about the other way around

[13:30] <moritz> I'm pretty sure it's not a proper superset of pod5

[13:31] <Grinnz> there weren't 5 pods (maybe I'm agreeing with AlexDaniel saying the 6 doesn't make sense there :)

[15:36] <El_Che> moritz: the idea is that Perl 6 is NOT the heir of Perl 5. It's also about "unfuckingup" the relation with Perl 5.

[15:39] *** jaldhar left

[15:40] <El_Che> moritz: sure, in my professional surroundings is Perl a curse worse and it means that a Perl 6 project has zero chance if you want more than 1 person. But it's also about giving Perl 5 people a change to clean up their reputation. If they succeed in that or not (or if we believe it possible or not), is up to them. But doing whatever possible to help with that is being a good community member.

[19:24] <timotimo> just filter out anything that starts with psaces

[23:27] <timotimo> haha, uint is so funny

[23:27] <Xliff> Yes. That's still a problem.

[23:28] <timotimo> not a problem when passing data to C

[23:29] <Xliff> Still. If I have a uint8, and I set it to 255. I bloody well wanna see 255, when I print it out!
