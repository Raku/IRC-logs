[10:59] *** ab6tract joined
[10:59] <ab6tract> o/ all :)

[10:59] <ab6tract> long time since i've been around, hope everyone is doing well!

[11:00] <ab6tract> i'm wondering if it is possible to define an infix:<'> operator that somehow has tighter precedence than quoting

[11:01] <ab6tract> The issue is that I'm not sure how to refer to the q/Q operator when calling the is tighter() trait

[11:04] <ab6tract> and/or that it might very well not be possible to get tighter than the quote parser

[11:05] <lizmat> wouldn't you need a postcircumfix operator ?

[11:05] <lizmat> or actually, a circumfix operator ?

[11:06] <pmurias> ab6tract: why would you want to do that?

[11:08] <ab6tract> no, it's to pass arguments to a constructor..  the idea is that 5'6 would be a call to sub infix:<'> ($min,$sec) { CoordDetails.new: :$min, :$sec }

[11:09] <ab6tract> then i could create a tighter infix:<°> operator that would take (Int, CoordDetails) as arguments

[11:09] <ab6tract> and return a Coord object

[11:10] <ab6tract> it might be a better approach to just make it a proper DSL using grammars but i thought there might be a way to do it with operators and export

[11:12] *** lizmat_ joined
[11:13] <pmurias> ab6tract: this seems like something that will work beyond horrible with syntax highlighting

[11:13] *** lizmat left
[11:14] *** pamplemousse joined
[11:15] <ab6tract> good point, but that's not a major concern for this project

[11:16] *** molaf joined
[11:17] <ab6tract> if it were a DSL, there would be no rule for quotation other than this infix representation

[11:18] <pmurias> ab6tract: what are you creating?

[11:18] <ab6tract> i'd rather keep that a bit quiet for the moment, if you don't mind :)

[11:19] <ab6tract> it's meant to be an interactive environment where you are exploring geometric relationships between objects

[11:19] <pmurias> ok, will it be unveiled later on?

[11:19] <ab6tract> based on command-line inputs

[11:19] <ab6tract> pmurias: very much so, yes 

[11:19] <ab6tract> the use case for this DSL is sort of an interactive terminal application, using Terminal::Print

[11:20] <ab6tract> "DSL" .. it's just meant to be a way to quickly create objects without having to use quotation marks

[11:21] <pmurias> by DSL you mean short snippets of Perl 6 with notation shortcuts?

[11:21] <pmurias> snippets being relatively simple expressions?

[11:21] <rba> rakudo.org is running on the nine-server now. let me know if there are any issues.

[11:22] *** dolmen left
[11:22] <rba> timotimo: May you have a look in the access log if you still have requests on the temp-server?

[11:24] <ab6tract> pmurias: right, I'm thinking of these operators as a "constructor chain" that slowly builds it's arguments from right to left.. first CoordDetails, then Coord, then Position, etc, which in the end returns an object that is fed into yet another operator, this time an infix to compare it with another Position object

[11:25] <antoniogamiz> m: enum A <b>; say so A::b;

[11:25] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[11:25] <ab6tract>  5°43'54

[11:25] <antoniogamiz> why enums evaluates to False?

[11:25] <ab6tract>  5°43'54 => Position.new: :degree(5), minute(43), :second(54)

[11:26] <ab6tract> sorry, that fat arrow is meant to imply 'returns this object'

[11:26] <Geth> ¦ rakudo.org: review: https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org/commit/838adbc882

[11:27] <ab6tract> one way to do it would be to use a slang, i assume

[11:30] *** lizmat joined
[11:30] <ab6tract> but this approach seemed sort of elegant, in a weird way

[11:31] <ab6tract> using custom operators and precedence

[11:32] <ab6tract> but honestly, i don't think it will work anyway because custom ops want whitespace

[11:35] <antoniogamiz> should I report this kind of errors in rakudo? => ===SORRY!===No such method 'Str' for invocant of type 'NQPMu'

[12:33] <crella> It seems not right. For example, when $a = 1,I want to set $b='1'; when $a = 77, I want to set $b = '77'

[12:33] <crella> I haven't found enough docs to solve this problem...

[12:34] *** lizmat_ left
[12:35] <timotimo> the code cygx gave you should be doing that, what issue are you seeing?

[12:35] <timotimo> m: my Int $a = 1; my Str $b = 'c'; $b = ~$a; dd $b # dd will output some extra info, such as the type and variable name

[12:38] <crella> c12  Str $b = "c12"

[12:38] <crella> c123  Str $b = "c123"

[12:39] <timotimo> oh, the issue is probably using the $b ~= $a, which is short-hand for $b = $b ~ $a where you really wanted $b = ~$a

[16:12] <timotimo> the very latest rakudo didn't yet get a bump for nine's incredible bug-fixing spree i don't think

[16:13] <jdv79> cool

[16:14] <timotimo> if the html output is too massive, you can ask it to output an .sql file and get moarperf from my github

[16:14] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/

[16:14] <timotimo> Comma also uses the sql format for its builtin profiling UI

[16:21] *** robertle joined
[16:23] <timotimo> maybe the profiler output should figure out if the html file ends up over like 50 megs and interactively offer to output sql instead/in addition

[16:41] <jdv79> idk.  but devel::nytprof manages to pump out html that's not killer like that:)

[16:41] <ugexe> in the profiler some tabs (like the default one) would crash if kept running but other tabs would immediately show their data

[16:41] <jdv79> maybe just kill the html output if it only works for trivial code sizes

[16:42] <jdv79> arm chair critiquing is too easy though

[16:43] <timotimo> it's still extremely valuable, since moarperf is quite a dependency

[16:44] <timotimo> i would say moar's profiler has a lot more information that nytprof (though it doesn't do per-line like nytprof does)

[16:44] <timotimo> i wonder if giving the json hashes in the output single-letter keys would help at all

[16:45] <timotimo> or using lists everywhere instead of maps

[16:45] <timotimo> if anybody would like to prototype that ... :)

[16:45] <jdv79> cool.  for me devel::nytprof is gold

[16:46] <jdv79> statement level has been invaluable to get some really perf sensitive code opti'd

[16:47] <jdv79> maybe p6 won't need those sorts of optis in the future so maybe not needed

[16:47] <timotimo> vrurg: yeah, put tracy start/end points all over the code

[16:47] <timotimo> but integrating the code with our current build system frightens me a little

[16:49] <vrurg> Hm... Not sure how much helpful can I be. I've got involved with nqp/rakudo for the reason I needed 6.e and I knew what I want from the result. But Moar – I've never been deep into it.

[16:49] <timotimo> well, i heard you can do perl5 code :D

[16:49] <vrurg> Need to carefully consider if it's be more help or damage if I try. ;)

[16:50] <timotimo> the fun thing is that the whole rest of moar is built with C, and this is now C++ code

[16:50] <vrurg> timotimo: not much, just ~20 years of it...

[16:50] <timotimo> i hope we can get this done in under a year

[16:51] <vrurg> How I wish it could be at least nqp... Perl5 regexes are so much out of the stone age to me now...

[16:53] <timotimo> jdv79: build and link tracy in moarvm's build

[16:54] <jdv79> is that some sort of best of bread profiler type thing?

[16:54] <timotimo> i don't know what "best of bread" means

[16:55] <jdv79> oh, breed

[16:55] <jdv79> best of its ilk

[16:55] <timotimo> hm. really more of a "good" profiler?

[16:55] <vrurg> timotimo: as a coincidence, I was looking into profiling lately too, with no success too. But still wonder how useful it would be in locating memory leaks on rakudo level? I.e. my code was relocating ~70k records from a .txt and .csv and ending up bloated to 6-7Gb. 

[16:55] <timotimo> it probably can't compete with Rad Game Tools's Telemetry

[16:56] <timotimo> vrurg: we have the moarvm heapanalyzer for that :)

[16:57] *** lizmat left
[16:57] *** lizmat joined
[16:57] <timotimo> moarvm already has "telemeh", which is slightly similar to tracy, but crucially there's no visualization tool, which makes it basically useless

[16:59] <vrurg> timotimo: moar-ha failed to read the dump for me. Can't remember details, something about unexpected uint size or alike. I'm gonna give it another try later and create a ticket if needed.

[17:00] <jdv79> what led to the decision to build a webapp to do the profiler?

[17:00] <jdv79> why not just static html files?

[17:01] *** lizmat_ joined
[17:01] * vrurg is preparing for diving into the dark waters of moar's configure...

[17:01] *** lizmat left
[17:02] <timotimo> vrurg: the moar heapanalyzer currently requires the program to shut down gracefully, maybe that didn't happen in your case

[17:03] <jdv79> installing the deps for moarperf might be worse than for $work and i thought that was the worst i'd ever seen:)

[17:03] <rba> Please help us to check if static generated docs on docs.p6c.org are looking fine before we make it available under docs.perl6.org

[17:03] <timotimo> in the future i'm hoping to just distribute finished js bundle files for that part of the whole

[17:03] <vrurg> timotimo: could be.

[17:04] <jdv79> both the p6 and the js took a while

[17:04] <jdv79> but that would help

[17:04] <timotimo> vrurg: if that's the case, you can also "use Telemetry" and then whenever you want a heapsnapshot to be made "snap :heap"

[17:04] <rba> https://docs.p6c.org

[17:04] * vrurg slaps own forehead.

[17:04] <MasterDuke> vrurg: heaptrack is also good for finding memory leaks

[17:05] <vrurg> Telemetry, of course!

[17:05] <vrurg> MasterDuke: noted, thanks!

[17:05] <timotimo> vrurg: to be fair, that is a new feature of that module

[17:05] <jdv79> moarperf seems to not work:(

[17:05] <timotimo> many cases of memory leaks in perl6 code are from where your program actually holds on to data for too long, which means it's not actually leaked

[17:05] <jdv79> i get a blank page

[17:05] <timotimo> jdv79: oh no! can you get output from the javascript console in the "inspect element" thingie?

[17:06] <timotimo> dev tools the experts call it i believe

[17:07] <jdv79> [ERROR] 403 /js/main.js - 127.0.0.1

[17:07] <timotimo> did you "npm run build"?

[17:07] <vrurg> timotimo: 6Gb is still too much. Besides, I suspect it's something in DB::Pg where nothing like this should happen. But, anyway, I have to process the information collected here so far first. :)

[17:08] <timotimo> vrurg: of course. i just mean it's not a leak that a regular c-level heap tracker like heaptrack or massif would figure out

[17:08] <jdv79> oh, forgot to after waiting for hte deps.  oops.

[17:08] <timotimo> it would make a lot of sense for moarperf to actually figure out when that happens

[17:09] <timotimo> it's a nightmare to build already with all the different moving parts

[17:09] <timotimo> gotta run! bbl!

[22:35] <vrurg> And on top of it – perhaps ulimit was reset as it leaving me no coredumps.

[22:43] <timotimo> is that with --profile=heap or with Telemetry?

[22:43] <vrurg> --profile=heap

[22:43] <vrurg> Still no core dump but have crash report from macOS. Perhaps this is for  a moar ticket?

[22:44] <MasterDuke> that should be a regular profile written to a file named `heap`

[22:47] *** mowcat left
[22:47] <vrurg> MasterDuke: ?? I mean, SIGSEGV should've been accompanied with a core file but my system ignores 'ulimit -c unlimited' and creates none.

[22:48] <MasterDuke> vrurg: i don't know anything about the crash, i just meant that --profile=foo now means the filename to write to. if you want a heap snapshot you have to use --profile-kind=heap

[22:49] <vrurg> MasterDuke: ah, I see. It was just a shortcut. for profile-kind. ;)

[23:35] <randy80> Should I report that as a bug? If so, where? I'm in the very early stages of learning Perl 6.

[23:36] <timotimo> yeah that's totally worth a bug

[23:37] <jdv79> i never got why people have such an issue with sigils

[23:38] <timotimo> i basically started with QBASIC, so ... :)

[23:38] <jdv79> maybe cause i learned p5 ver early, maybe my 3rd lang or so.

[23:38] <jdv79> nice

[23:38] <timotimo> i was young and i didn't know what i was doing

[23:38] <timotimo> after that came VB5 :)

[23:43] <jdv79> im trying to remember.  maybe qbasic, php, p5, js, cf...

[23:44] <jdv79> all meh langs
