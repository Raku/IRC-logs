[01:29] <zachk> how can i compare types of variables?

[01:29] <timotimo> you can get an object's type object with the .WHAT pseudo-method

[01:30] <timotimo> if you are interested in the variable, actually, like the constraint it was declared with, you'll need to access the .VAR

[01:34] *** Ven`` joined
[01:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v Ven``

[01:47] <zachk> but say i want to compare two variables and see if their types are equal?

[01:51] *** kurahaupo_ joined
[01:52] *** kurahaupo left
[01:52] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v kurahaupo_

[01:58] <timotimo> there are many different ways to interpret that

[01:58] <timotimo> m: my Int $foo; my Str $bar; say "$foo.VAR.WHAT.^name() equal to $bar.VAR.WHAT.^name()?"

[01:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «Scalar equal to Scalar?␤»

[01:59] <timotimo> m: my Int $foo; my Str $bar; say "$foo.VAR.of.^name() equal to $bar.VAR.of.^name()?"

[01:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «Int equal to Str?␤»

[01:59] <timotimo> m: my Int $foo = <0xff>; my Int $bar = 255; say "$foo.VAR.of.^name() equal to $bar.VAR.of.^name()?"; say "$foo equal to $bar?"

[01:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «Int equal to Int?␤0xff equal to 255?␤»

[01:59] <timotimo> m: my Int $foo = <0xff>; my Int $bar = 255; say "$foo.WHAT.^name() equal to $bar.WHAT.^name()?"; say "$foo equal to $bar?"

[01:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «IntStr equal to Int?␤0xff equal to 255?␤»

[02:00] <timotimo> what semantics are you interested in?

[02:01] <timotimo> the kind of variable, aka Scalar vs Proxy vs Native Reference?

[02:01] <timotimo> the constraint the variable was declared with? i.e. my Int $foo vs my Str $bar?

[02:01] <timotimo> the type of the value that's in the variable? that'd be $foo.WHAT vs $bar.WHAT

[02:01] <timotimo> and do you want to accept subclasses of one in the other?

[02:02] *** mowcat joined
[02:02] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v mowcat

[02:03] <timotimo> i think what you want will be $foo.WHAT === $bar.WHAT

[02:04] <timotimo> not many prog languages have first-class scalar variables or introspectable lexicals or stuff like that

[02:14] * Ven`` certainly can't think of many off the top of their head

[02:15] <Ven``> m: subset MyInt of Int; say MyInt ~~ Int; say Int ~~ MyInt;

[02:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[02:26] <vrurg> Can I have own control exceptions defined? I.e. to have them processed in a CONTROL block? Application of X::Control is not sufficient, seemingly.

[02:27] <zachk> whats that triple equals? === ? 

[02:28] <vrurg> zachk: same object equality. 

[02:28] <vrurg> m: my $a = 1; my $b = 1; say $a === $b; $b := $a; say $b === $a

[02:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «True␤True␤»

[02:30] <vrurg> Ah, constant.

[02:30] <vrurg> m: class Foo {}; say Foo.new === Foo.new

[02:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[02:32] <lookatme_q> m: say 1 == True; say 1 === True; say True === True;

[02:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar f010ef57a: OUTPUT: «True␤False␤True␤»

[02:32] <lookatme_q> zachk, you can using === check if they are same object

[02:33] <zachk> does that compare instance variables too inside an object instance?

[14:17] <HaraldJoerg> Is there a way to have Perl 6 *write* integers as non-ASCII numerals?

[14:18] <timotimo> well, there is a module for roman numerals

[14:18] <SmokeMachine> there is a module for japanese too...

[14:19] <HaraldJoerg> I know this one, but I'm more interested in extant systems

[14:22] *** vrurg joined
[14:22] <timotimo> it's relatively easy if the other numeral system is 10-based

[14:23] <HaraldJoerg> I've used two 10-based here: indian and devanagari

[15:38] <tadzik> the backstories of those commits are fun to read, like https://github.com/perl6/DBIish/commit/1137c6dbf0d85e600315ec652fdae9c237e6b656

[15:40] <tadzik> https://github.com/perl6/DBIish/commit/97247e2dcf0a80c2dcf6fa5991c127b5392e715d I find the most surprising

[15:40] <Kaiepi> i had no idea conditional method calls were possible

[15:41] *** glom left
[15:46] <fluca1978> I read about conditional method calls in brian d foy's book

[15:47] <fluca1978> however I did not realized it was optimized with regard to .^can

[15:48] <jnthn> It's optimized to the point that, if in type-specialized code, it can even throw out the conditional part, rendering it as a constant or a normal method call, and the latter is then an inline candidate.

[15:48] <Kaiepi> brian d foy's book?

[15:48] <jnthn> So in the best cases it's "free"

[15:49] <fluca1978> Kaiepi:Learning Perl 6: Keeping the Easy, Hard, and Impossible

[15:49] <jnthn> Goodness, punctuation really saves that book title :P

[15:51] <fluca1978> anyone can help me understanding the relationship between nqp and rakudo? I mean, nqp is somehow used to implement rakudo (bootstrapping) or am I misunderstanding?

[15:51] <Kaiepi> is it worth giving a read if you've already been using perl 6 for around a year?

[15:52] <jnthn> fluca1978: It's a little confusing in that we tend to use "NQP" to refer to two things. One of them is NQP the language, which is a bootstrapped subset of Perl 6 that's easier to implement and optimize.

[15:52] <fluca1978> Kaiepi: I don't think, one year is enough to get all the concepts expressed in the book. But, on the other side, brian is a very proficent developer and writer, so...

[15:53] <jnthn> However, also contained in the NQP repository is a bunch of compiler infrastructure (such as code generation) that Rakudo uses too

[15:53] <jnthn> So you can see NQP as being a mini Perl 6 that includes a compiler toolkit in its standard library. :)

[15:54] <fluca1978> jnthn: but what compiles NQP then?

[15:55] <jnthn> fluca1978: NQP. The repository includes a snapshot that is good enough to compile the current version.

[15:55] <jnthn> fluca1978: Of course, if you go back enough years, there was an NQP written in something else.

[15:56] <jnthn> Just like there was a first C compiler not written in C, for example.

[15:57] <fluca1978> jnthn: therefore, there is a binary snapshot of NQP to bootstrap the compiler that in turn compiles NQP the language, so in this sense it is meta-circular, right?

[15:58] <sena_kun> it is

[15:58] <jnthn> fluca1978: Yes

[15:59] <jnthn> At some point it stops hurting to think about. :)

[15:59] <fluca1978> and what does it mean that NQP is lighter than Perl6? I mean, NQP has classes itself, so what makes the runtime smaller?

[16:00] <[Coke]> supports less language syntax, for example

[16:00] <[Coke]> fewer builtin classes.

[16:00] <jnthn> It has simplified/cheating versions of a lot of Perl 6 language features, and then excludes quite a number of other features.

[16:01] <[Coke]> only binding, no assignment.

[16:01] <jnthn> That also, which is a big simplification.

[16:01] <jnthn> Also no laziness

[16:01] <jnthn> No high-level concurrency stuff

[16:02] <jnthn> No operator overloading or custom operators, etc.

[16:02] <fluca1978> got it

[16:03] <vrurg> The above mentioning of .^can reminded me: what is the best way of getting method object of a class? So far, I'm stuck to find_method.

[16:03] <jnthn> vrurg: What does "best" mean? .^find_method is best if you're just after something to invoke; .^lookup is best if you're after it for introspection.

[16:04] <Xliff> jnthn: At which point does it stop hurting, and when it does, should I worry?

[16:04] <Xliff> (and you are right about that title! LOL)

[16:05] <vrurg> jnthn: For invoking. Thanks! I just thought that I might be missing something like &sub but for methods.

[16:06] <jnthn> Xliff: I guess the point I really got settled with it was when I was working on the JVM porting, and realized that one can write a bytecode generator, then run the compiler on the VM that already exists but have it "cross-compile", and then use that cross-compiler to compile NQP itself.

[16:06] <jnthn> So basically, you get it to spit itself out but for another virtual machine

[16:06] <jnthn> I've done that twice over by now. Whether that's worrying, well... :-)

[16:07] <Xliff> So kinda like Java and Android?!?

[16:07] <fluca1978> Xliff: java and jikesrvm

[16:08] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v jmerelo

[16:08] <Xliff> fluca1978: So similar situation. jikesrvm uses the Java language spec, but does not compile to the JVM

[16:08] <Xliff> Android apps work in the same way.

[16:09] <fluca1978> Xliff: jikesrvm is written in java and does compile to java bytecode (JIT), it bootstraps out of an image obtained by another virtual machine

[16:09] <jnthn> Yeah, it's all the same kind of stuff.

[16:11] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v ferreira1

[16:12] <Xliff> OK. So meta-circular. Got it.

[16:12] *** fluca1978 left
[16:13] <sena_kun> is NQP interpreting though?

[16:14] <sena_kun> as in, a C compiler written in C doesn't really belong to the list.

[16:14] <jnthn> Yeah, I'd tend to refer to it as a "bootstrapped compiler"

[17:01] <mux__> I'm experiencing a strange behavior from perl6 + tmux. I want to record the cursor position and restore it using tput.

[17:01] <mux__> This works as expected in a bare Xterm or VT: perl6 -e'print "save"; run <tput sc>; say ""; sleep 1; print "restore"; run <tput rc>; sleep 1; print 42'

[17:01] <mux__> But running it in tmux seems to only restore the column, not the row.

[17:01] <mux__> Using tput in the shell works just fine everywhere though: echo -n save; tput sc; sleep 1; echo; sleep 1; echo -n restore; sleep 1; tput rc; echo 42

[17:35] <Xliff> I mean, about the best you can do is say "returns Pointer"

[17:35] <sena_kun> Kaiepi, what's the rule of this progression? are 1,2,9 hard-coded?

[17:35] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v rindolf

[17:36] <Kaiepi> it starts with 1,2,3, then the next three digits are the last digit of the previous triple and its consecutive digits

[17:36] <Kaiepi> so 1,2,3, then 3,4,5, then 5,6,7, etc.

[17:36] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: but how do I call it?

[17:37] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: You can't.

[17:37] <Xliff> Not from Perl6.

[17:37] <sena_kun> hmm... that seems quite specific to me, I'd go with a simple iterative approach to make later understanding easier. though it sounds like a golfing task where cryptic == better, yes?

[17:37] <Xliff> SmokeMachine: About the only thing you could do is write a wrapper that would take the pointer and do the invocation from C. Then you have the whole hassle of parameters.

[17:38] <Xliff> C calling C is best left to C.

[19:26] *** guifa joined
[19:26] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v guifa

[19:28] <guifa> When calling a grammar with an action, the grammar can refer directly to its action class with .actions but is there any built-in way to do the reverse (reference the grammar in the action)

[19:29] <masak> no

[19:29] <masak> what is it you want to do, more broadly?

[19:30] <SmokeMachine> can you, from the Grammar, do something like `self.actions.grammar = self`?

[19:34] <guifa> Just trying to better separate grammar from actions.  I'm writing a pretty extensive/customizable brainfuck interpreter using grammar/actions, the main stumbling block I've had is handling the loops.  Their inner code has to parsed separate from regular code to avoid early execution, but then sent back to get parsed as runnable code, which is easily done with the actions code is embedded in the grammar, but no really elegant way to do

[19:36] <masak> hm

[19:36] <masak> what you do sounds like a bit of a grammar code smell, if you don't mind me saying

[19:37] <masak> notably, I'm pretty sure it should be possible to parse everything with one pass, and then not again

[19:37] <masak> that should be your goal, too ;)

[19:37] <guifa> Single pass would be optimal haha, but I'm a bit stumped at doing that

[19:38] <guifa> I mean, obviously there are more efficient ways to process BF, but I wanted to try to learn Grammar/Actions and it's actually be pretty useful as a exercise in learning

[19:41] <SmokeMachine> guifa: I've been doing something like it... not with brainfuck, but with bernalang... https://github.com/FCO/bernalang

[19:42] <SmokeMachine> guifa: here is my grammar: https://github.com/FCO/bernalang/blob/master/lib/Berna/Grammar.pm6

[19:43] <SmokeMachine> Xliff: Im thinking of doing a machine-code bernalang^^ compiler using gccjit... :)

[19:44] *** zakharyas left
[19:46] <guifa> I'm glancing it over really fast but it looks like you're parsing/compiling and then doing a separate execution phase yeah?

[19:47] <masak> oh, you're not? then I understand your predicament better

[19:47] <masak> so your actions are basically an interpreter?

[19:47] <guifa> Indeed.  BF is sufficiently simple enough that you can do that.  When it parses a +, it increments the value at the point as the action right then and there.

[19:49] *** cfa left
[19:49] <masak> I think you'll find the order the actions fire is a bad fit for your interpreter idea

[19:50] <masak> with the example of a +, at the point the action sees it, you don't know if that + is inside a loop (and should be deferred) or not inside one (and shouldn't)

[19:50] <masak> because actions fire bottom-up, and loops (kinda) are more top-down :)

[19:50] <guifa> Yeah.  That was something that took me a bit to work around, but I did get it all working.

[19:50] <masak> heh :)

[19:51] <masak> don't really know what to say except it seems you're working against the grain

[19:51] <guifa> Probably :-)

[19:51] <masak> I think you'll find it's a lot easier to write a brainfuck *compiler* than a brainfuck *interpreter* using grammar/actions

[19:53] <guifa> Possibly.  I might do a later modification for that.  My real goal wasn't so much learning to write compilers, but just getting a good feel for grammar rules that adequately catch stuff, and then attaching some actions.  I had tortured myself way back when making an Applescript Brainfuck interpreter so figured what the hell ;-)

[19:53] <guifa> but as is typical for me, once I start, I like to see how far I can take it

[19:54] <masak> moritz++ might amend what I'm about to say here, but...

[19:54] <masak> ...I find actions work best when you exploit the fact that they're bottom-up, rather than try to fight it

[19:54] *** sena_kun left
[19:54] <masak> it's one of those things, I realize that nowadays I've started to *think* that way, and I try to do stuff bottom-up even outside of actions sometimes

[20:00] <masak> second more advanced rule (for free, even though nobody asked):

[20:00] *** El_Che joined
[20:00] <masak> never *ever* fire a side effect before you know you're in the right rule

[20:00] <guifa> Yeah, the only way to handle (AFAICT) a loop is to do a separate inner code rule from the main rule that doesn't have actions attached, and then inside the action call .parse(:rule<maincode>, :actions(self.actions) repeatedly.  For anything more complex than BF I don't think an interpreter inside of the grammar itself is really feasible just because you'd have to include both executing and not executing rules for all code

[20:00] *** p6bannerbot sets mode: +v El_Che

[20:01] <masak> also, you're multiple-parsing, which is maybe fine for an interpreter, but just generally problematic :)

[20:01] <masak> how do you handle missing `]` ?

[20:02] <guifa> At the moment, I don't.  The joys of BF is there's no single specification (which did let me have fun with some adverbs)

[20:03] <guifa> :8bit :16bit :32bit for instance is a cool way to take advantage of the adverbs

[20:05] *** rindolf joined

[20:06] <masak> yes, that reads quite well :)

[20:09] <guifa> I originally included ? as a built in dump command, but then I figured it'd be cooler as a grammar extension.  I get that the not-best-practices in handling the loop but… I think I can make a pretty cool tutorial with it to show off some of the nicer features of p6 (while including a warning that it's probably best not to make an interpreter out of grammars in the real world ;-) )

[21:40] <sena_kun> can someone point me to how names declared as enum values are promoted to types? I am reading https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L4851 but no much luck. When I am constructing an enum using MOP with base_type == Int and with a simple `add_enum_value($str-int-pair))`, is type created? If yes, how can I get it to set it a name and export appropriately? If not, how can I create one?

[21:40] <sena_kun> As in...

[22:38] <rindolf> hi all

[22:38] <sena_kun> o/

[22:38] <rindolf> how was the squashathon?

[22:40] <sena_kun> testneeded tickets... Some were closed, I think. :)

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> not very active actually

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> there were many easy tickets but people didn't feel like resolving any of them

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> maybe every month is too often, I dunno :)

[22:42] <sena_kun> any ideas on how to imitate nqp::rebless op from high level code? I really don't want to do `use nqp` and copy-paste what rakudo does.

[22:56] <Kaypie> i'm surprised i was considered to have made the most/best prs during the squashathon in order to win the camelia plushie

[22:56] <Kaypie> i only made one pullreq and it was like 5 lines

[22:56] *** molaf left
[23:02] <sena_kun> next one may be more popular. :)

[23:03] *** Ven`` joined

[23:06] <scovit> I do not care about performances now (I plan to add caching)

[23:06] <scovit> sorry

[23:15] <jnthn> sena_kun: nqp::rebless is used by .^mixin, so that's probably what you want

[23:15] <jnthn> (This is in turn what's used to implement does and but)

[23:16] <jnthn> (Which is also what would normally be used)

[23:21] <sena_kun> jnthn, so if I want to turn `1` into my created enum type, it'd be like... hmm. `but` gives me `Int+{foo-enum}`, which fails a check against plain `my custom $a` type. 

[23:22] <sena_kun> I have found https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/World.nqp#L3900 but not yet sure how to recreate it without nqp. :)

[23:23] <jnthn> sena_kun: You don't want to do that :)

[23:23] <jnthn> m: enum A <B C D>; say A(1)

[23:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d7cdc0f4: OUTPUT: «C␤»

[23:23] <jnthn> Just use the coercion form like that

[23:25] <sena_kun> jnthn, well, I have to create enum without using explicit `enum Foo <>`. And I hope to do it without EVAL. This is what I "want" to do. :)

[23:26] <jnthn> Ah

[23:26] <sena_kun> or, rather, I can create it, but values.

[23:26] <sena_kun> that's the issue.

[23:26] <sena_kun> as in, well...

[23:27] <sena_kun> I can create a type, but `add_enum_value` MOP call just does a binding, so I cannot just bind some Int as a value, it'll break typing.

[23:27] <jnthn> Can you do $the-enum-type-object.new($the-integer) ?

[23:27] <sena_kun> so I looked at how rakudo creates stuff and found out that e.g. Int value can be reblessed to newly created enum type(not even composed yed as I get it), but... Nope, I can't.

[23:28] <sena_kun>  my $new-enum = Metamodel::EnumHOW.new_type(name => 'custom', base_type => Int); $new-enum.new(1).say;

[23:28] <sena_kun> m: my $new-enum = Metamodel::EnumHOW.new_type(name => 'custom', base_type => Int); $new-enum.new(1).say;

[23:28] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d7cdc0f4: OUTPUT: «P6opaque: must compose custom before allocating␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:28] <sena_kun> not how it would work.

[23:28] <jnthn> Try $new-enum.^compose before the .new call

[23:28] <jnthn> Or at least .^compose_repr

[23:29] <sena_kun> jnthn, will it be possible to still `^add_enum_value` after compose? That's why I avoided it... Let me try...

[23:29] <jnthn> I think yes, and if there's issues you can perhaps always re-compose

[23:29] <jnthn> I wonder if we should provide some nice MOP method to save people figuring this all out...

[23:30] <sena_kun> woooah

[23:30] <sena_kun> ^compose_repr

[23:30] <sena_kun> ugh

[23:30] <sena_kun> sorry. *compose_repr has helped. \o/

[23:30] <jnthn> yay ;)

[23:30] <jnthn> *:)

[23:30] <sena_kun> m:  my $new-enum = Metamodel::EnumHOW.new_type(name => 'custom', base_type => Int); $new-enum.^compose_repr; my \Two = $new-enum.new(2); say Two;

[23:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d7cdc0f4: OUTPUT: «2␤»

[23:30] <sena_kun> m:  my $new-enum = Metamodel::EnumHOW.new_type(name => 'custom', base_type => Int); $new-enum.^compose_repr; my \Two = $new-enum.new(2); say Two.^name;

[23:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d7cdc0f4: OUTPUT: «custom␤»

[23:31] <sena_kun> one less issue towards the goal. \o/

[23:31] <sena_kun> jnthn, thanks a lot!
