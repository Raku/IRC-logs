[09:47] <jmerelo> I don't know who's around, but for the past week no one else has worked on the documentation repo. And not a whole lot of people in the last month.

[09:47] <jmerelo> Documentation is essential for newcomers to the language and seasoned programmers alike. We need to keep it current, fresh and accurate.

[09:48] <jmerelo> Camelia would really be grateful if you devoted even a minute amount of your time, 30 minutes a week, to address and help solve an issue

[09:48] <jmerelo> I would be kinda grateful too.

[09:50] *** ravenousmoose left

[10:40] <antoniogamiz> mmm zef has given me this error while installing Perl6::TypeGraph

[10:40] <antoniogamiz> Invocant of method 'match' must be a type object of type 'Any', not an object instance of type 'Pair'.  Did you forget a 'multi'?

[10:40] <antoniogamiz> do you think it's a problem with the module or with zef?

[10:41] <sena_kun> with the module

[10:41] <antoniogamiz> oh right I've just seen build is failing :(

[10:42] <sena_kun> you call somewhere `match` on Pair, which won't work

[10:45] <antoniogamiz> yep but I think the problem is Perl6::Load module

[10:45] <antoniogamiz> If I use extract-pod it does not happen, I will talk to jmerelo to see what's happening

[10:46] <antoniogamiz> ty sena_kun :)

[10:46] <sena_kun> hmmm...

[10:46] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, `zef test .` in this repo gives me Testing [OK].

[10:46] <sena_kun> travis is happy too

[10:47] <antoniogamiz> yep, that's the weird thing

[10:47] <sena_kun> https://travis-ci.org/antoniogamiz/Perl6-TypeGraph

[10:47] <antoniogamiz> but this errror appears if I use pod::load

[10:47] <antoniogamiz> https://travis-ci.org/antoniogamiz/Perl6-Documentable/builds/543102809

[10:47] <antoniogamiz> now I have changed to extract-pod again

[10:48] <antoniogamiz> I'm not using pod::load in Typegraph

[10:48] <antoniogamiz> agh I sent another link sorry 

[10:49] <antoniogamiz> uoh, ok, I have messed up a little. Sorry for the confusion

[10:50] <sena_kun> no problem

[10:50] <antoniogamiz> problem is Perl6::Typegraph passes all tests but zef gives an error

[10:51] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, what "zef"? `zef install`?

[10:51] <antoniogamiz> yep

[10:51] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, with your changes on what is on master right now?

[10:51] <sena_kun> s/changes/local changes/

[10:52] <antoniogamiz> master

[10:52] <sena_kun> ooh, I see it

[10:54] <sena_kun> ran it with `perl6 --ll-exception /home/koto/.perl6/bin/zef install .` and seeing a full exception trace

[10:54] <sena_kun> `in code  at /home/koto/.perl6/sources/41DA11BE079F2990A0E18D318378B5EBD357C8EF (Zef::Client) line 514`

[10:56] <sena_kun> it seems to try to report `"Filtering [FAIL] for {$candi.dist.?identity // $candi.as}: {$*error}"` but can't

[10:58] <sena_kun> why am I even looking into it instead of Cro::WebSocket bug... Ah, right, I can't fix it. :/

[10:58] *** mowcat joined
[10:58] <antoniogamiz> mmm uoh

[10:58] <antoniogamiz> :/

[10:59] <antoniogamiz> good luck with that bug :D

[11:05] <sena_kun> hmm, UNDO block just gives a warning, but the actual error is somewhere else...

[11:07] <sena_kun> aaaaah

[11:07] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, I see the issue

[11:08] <sena_kun> https://github.com/antoniogamiz/Perl6-TypeGraph/blob/master/META6.json#L18-L22 <- this is either incorrect or not yet implemented format. it has to be just "resources": ["data/type-graph.txt"]

[11:09] <sena_kun> let's see if I can get us a better error message...

[11:11] <sena_kun> `data => [type-graph.txt]` this is a Pair...

[11:11] <sena_kun> m: say from-json('{"data": ["a"]}')

[11:17] <antoniogamiz> meta test doesnt give an error mm

[11:18] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, that's a miss of meta test. ;) pull requests are welcome, I think

[11:18] <sena_kun> I wrote a patch for zef

[11:18] <sena_kun> to print `Every item in 'resources' Hash of META6.json must be a string, got $type instead` instead of this cryptic error

[11:18] <sena_kun> preparing it...

[11:19] *** veesh joined
[11:19] <antoniogamiz> :D

[11:27] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, https://github.com/ugexe/zef/pull/305 <- here is the PR

[11:30] <sena_kun> using stacktrace from using --ll-exception flag, I obtained this file/line, saw it is related to processing 'resources' field, checked your META6.json, saw it isn't a list of strings. then an `unless` and `die` improved the issue.

[11:32] <sena_kun> tested it out with `perl6 -I../zef/lib ../zef/bin/zef install .` when playing with zef sources in sibling directory

[11:32] <sena_kun> hope that helps

[11:33] <sena_kun> so it was an error in the META6.json... but zef's error message was LTA too. :)

[11:34] <antoniogamiz> thanks a lot sena_kun :)

[11:34] <antoniogamiz> are you altai_man too? 

[11:34] <sena_kun> yup

[11:34] <antoniogamiz> ah :D

[11:35] <antoniogamiz> ups now it gives a different error :(

[11:35] <sena_kun> there is certain confusion because I tend to use different nicknames on different services. :/

[11:35] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, a log?

[11:35] <antoniogamiz> https://gist.github.com/antoniogamiz/1bd0c122938fc3baa14cec2ce3439050

[11:36] <antoniogamiz> ah permission denied..

[11:36] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, and it is not related to `Perl6::TypeGraph`, I suspect. I was able to install typegraph distribution just fine after 'resources' field fix.

[11:37] <antoniogamiz> yep it's my fault sorry, I had to execute it with sudo

[11:40] <antoniogamiz> everythings working now! ty sena!

[11:41] <sena_kun> you are welcome

[19:03] <tobs> I want to parse expressions (mostly polynomials, but extensibility would be nice). The operator precedence parser part of nqp's HLL::Grammar looks really neat. Is that available in a stable form (as I hear you shouldn't use nqp in Perl 6 code)?

[19:04] <moritz> not really

[19:06] <moritz> though if you create one and put it on modules.perl6.org, people will use it

[19:07] <tobs> sounds like something worth doing, indeed

[19:07] <tobs> The Rakudo and NQP internals course calls it only "mildly" terrifying. I'll have a look :-)

[19:09] <moritz> well, you probably don't need all the jazz that p6 needs

[19:09] <moritz> like chaining ops *and* postcircumfixes *and* whatever

[20:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «hello␤True␤»

[20:26] <uzl> Would it be possible to capture a sub's output to STDOUT in a variable?

[20:27] <Kaiepi> i think? gimme a sec

[20:27] <timotimo> IO::Capture::Tiny? :)

[20:29] <Kaiepi> m: sub get-out(--> Str) { $*OUT.seek: 0; $*OUT.print: 'ayy lmao'; my Str $ret = $*OUT.slurp; $*OUT.seek: $ret.elems; $ret }; say get-out

[20:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «a␤y lmao»

[20:29] <Kaiepi> i'm probably using seek wrong but  that's the gist of it

[20:31] <timotimo> wow, why does that work

[20:32] <uzl> timotimo: I was hoping that I could without a module but will give it a try though ;-)

[20:32] <mst> this is a perl. it's modules all the way down

[20:32] <uzl> Kaiepi: I'll have to unpack and go back to the docs ;-)

[20:34] <uzl> mst: I know ... but I must install it ...

[20:35] <mst> clearly you need to copy p3rl.org/CloudPAN

[20:36] <uzl> Kaiepi: Your snippet isn't working on my machine. I'm getting: It is not possible to seek this kind of handle

[20:38] <timotimo> well, you can't use it if your stdout is just connected to the tty

[20:38] <timotimo> or pty i guess

[20:38] <lizmat> weekly: https://twitter.com/Mrofnet/status/1137424708591390721

[20:38] <notable6> lizmat, Noted!

[20:39] <Kaiepi> how about this

[20:39] <Kaiepi> m: sub foo { $*OUT.lock; $*OUT.print: 'ayy lmao'; my Str $ret = $*OUT.slurp; $*OUT.unlock; $ret; }; say foo

[20:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «ayy lmao␤»

[20:39] <Kaiepi> oh sweet i'm in the weekly!

[20:40] <timotimo> greppable6: "use JSON::Fast"

[20:40] <greppable6> timotimo, Found nothing!

[20:41] <timotimo> phew, that's a relief

[20:41] <timotimo> greppable6: use JSON::Fast

[20:41] <AlexDaniel`> without quotes maybe

[20:41] <yoleaux> 14 May 2019 13:52Z <vrurg> AlexDaniel`: VERSION is in tools/templates; the submodule isn't in Perl Foundation because I had no access to it. I wish to see it under perl6.

[20:41] <greppable6> timotimo, 238 lines, 106 modules: https://gist.github.com/8afed318d51317404d79b0827603ed68

[20:41] <AlexDaniel`> it's a p5 regex

[20:41] <AlexDaniel`> is it? now you have to maintain it

[20:43] <uzl> Kaiepi: That seems to work but but the terminal stays as if waiting for input. I needed to press ctrl+c.

[21:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Array @o = ["foobar"]␤»

[21:08] <timotimo> but then no methods on $*OUT will work, like .nl-out or .t or something
