[20:50] <hythm> how to match anything between '<' and '>' ? this regex works / '<' ~ '>'  <-[<>]>* /  but of course will fail  when the string in between contains '<' or '>' 

[20:52] <Grinnz> if it's HTML or XML, use an HTML or XML parser

[20:52] <Grinnz> regexes are not good at balanced text

[20:52] <Grinnz> perhaps they can be in perl 6, but i don't know :)

[20:53] <tadzik> yeah, they can

[20:54] <tadzik> because they're not regular anymore :P

[20:54] <hythm> its not html, its to parse module spec, like Module::Name:ver<0.0.1>:auth<name>

[20:55] <tadzik> well then you have a problem: how do you know if it's ver => 0.0.1, auth => name and not ver => "0.0.1:auth<name"

[20:55] <tadzik> it only makes sense to disallow the <'s and >'s inside the <'s and >'s

[20:55] <hythm> i have a grammar that works but it fails to parse when auth field has email if the form "name [email@hidden.address]
[20:56] <tadzik> does perl 6 actually allow that?

[20:56] <Grinnz> the only way that would be possible is balanced parsing

[20:56] <tadzik> or a lot of backtracing

[20:56] <tadzik> for that case

[20:56] <Grinnz> ok, the only sensible way ;)

[20:57] <tadzik> :P

[20:57] <japhb> hythm: Why not just copy the way that Rakudo itself does the module spec parse?  That's part of the advantage of having a parser for the language written in the language itself.  :-)

[20:58] *** netrino joined
[20:58] <tadzik> possibly it's even possible to use it directly without copying

[20:58] <tobs> m: class X:auth<abc<> {}; say X.^auth

[20:58] <japhb> I mean, depends on your exact usage of course, but I suspect you will at the very least get ideas, and in the best case, can just use the real parser.

[20:58] <japhb> Yeah, what tadzik says.

[20:58] <tobs> apparently it has to be balanced in Perl 6

[21:01] <hythm> looking at rakudo code to see how its parsed, hopefully its not in nqp land
