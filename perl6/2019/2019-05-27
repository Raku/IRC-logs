[06:18] <Xliff> Oh noes! Ppl will have to actually do something with other ppl!

[06:18] <jmerelo> Xliff: there's always Twitter... And IRC!

[06:18] <Xliff> Oh gawd. When Twitter dies... that's when Prince comes back to life and we party like it's 1999.

[06:19] <lizmat> https://www.reddit.com/r/perl6/comments/btij1g/perl6_on_jvm_how/   # question on Reddit

[06:20] <jmerelo> Xliff:  :-)

[06:22] <jmerelo> lizmat: so, what's the state of the JVM now? I'm not really sure

[06:22] * lizmat neither

[06:22] <lizmat> I guess bartolin knows best

[06:22] <lizmat> and maybe pmurias

[06:23] <jmerelo> Last Saturday I also went to a presentation about GraalVM. I checked out the repo for Perl 6 on GraalVM and it seems to be somewhat advanced

[06:23] <lizmat> that's what pmurias is also working on, no ?

[06:24] <jmerelo> lizmat: right. And Rakudo.js as well, which is totally different, right?

[06:26] <Xliff> Actually...what is the state of PERL6 right now?

[06:26] <Xliff> I cannot use rakudobrew to build moar-master. Only moar-blead seems to work.

[06:27] <Xliff> Also...noticing HUGE increase in compile time for moar-blead on my VM

[06:27] <Xliff> By a factor of like... 2

[06:27] *** netrino left
[06:27] <jmerelo> Xliff: it's on its way to 2019.06, I guess... 

[06:28] <lizmat> Xliff: compile time of the setting, or of modules ?

[06:28] <Xliff> Compile times of my modules.

[06:28] *** Manifest0 left
[06:28] <lizmat> do you recompile rakudo regularly ?

[06:29] <Xliff> Yes

[06:29] <lizmat> if so, you may want to purge your .precomp directories

[06:29] <Xliff> OK.

[06:29] <lizmat> every re-compile of rakudo, will cause a fresh batch of your modules precomp files

[06:30] <Xliff> lizmat: I know.

[06:30] <lizmat> oki  :-)

[06:30] *** sauvin left
[06:30] <lizmat> not sure if that's the reason, but it definitely doesn't help

[06:30] <Xliff> This is the second time I've had a performance degredation like this. Fortunately doesn't appear to factor in to runtime.

[06:30] <Xliff> Just parse

[06:31] <Xliff> I will bug the build errors with rakudobrew, then.

[14:14] <timotimo> hum. modules.perl6.org doesn't render ```blah``` as code, we should perhaps find out why that is (since the Result dist uses it in its readme and that is linked from the weekly, it'll have some visibility)

[14:22] <ugexe> patrickb: looks right to me? my $x = C.new ($x is C). $x .= c.b ($x is assigned the result of $x.c, and then .b is called on that)

[14:26] <patrickb> ugexe: I do understand what it's doing. I was just wondering whether it's intended behavior, as my intuition points in a different direction.

[14:28] *** Ven`` left
[14:28] <patrickb> I guess I expected that `$x .= c.b` somehow desugars to / is equivalent to `$x = $x.c.b`

[14:30] <antoniogamiz> o/

[14:31] <antoniogamiz> moritz: could you explain to me how Perl6::Documentable::Registry lookup method works please?

[14:32] <ugexe> i suppose that might be more useful than being able to if($x .= child("myfile.txt").e) { ... }

[14:32] <antoniogamiz> I dont understand how it is initialized

[14:32] <ugexe> i avoid mutating usually so i suppose my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt

[14:32] <moritz> antoniogamiz: that's the "unless %!cache{$by}:exists {

[14:32] <moritz> }" part

[14:33] <antoniogamiz> yep, but I still dont know how that code initializes the cache :(

[14:33] <moritz> which part is unclear to you?

[14:34] <moritz> if $by is "kind"

[14:34] <moritz> then it goes through all documentables

[14:35] <moritz> and adds the documentable $d to %!cache{"kind"}{$d.kind()}

[14:36] <antoniogamiz> aaahhhh that the second pair of curly braces initializes that key?

[14:36] <antoniogamiz> I did not know that :p

[18:08] <xinming_> What I mean is, with array like var, Maybe seq, When we use decont operation, There will be no result saved.

[18:08] <xinming_> I just confused with these.

[19:14] <nadim_> hi all, two questions, one of them pretty serious, #1 am I the only one that gets tests failing sometimes but at the next run they work just fine! And it's quite often.

[19:14] <nadim_> #2 what's "New type Stash for Str is not a mixin type"?

[19:16] <nadim_> the error points at this code: if $clone.flat && (try require Data::Dump::Tree::LayHorizontal <&lay_horizontal>) !=== Nil    but  it happens when I modify code_after_ that line

[19:50] <Xliff> What's the best way to populate a CUnion from Perl6?

[20:06] <[Sno]> Xliff: can you describe a little bit more detailed what you plan to do? I think I don't get the core of your question.

[20:29] <Xliff> [Sno]: Well, I have a CUnion of several different structs. 

[20:29] <Xliff> And I want to know the best way to assign one of those member structs back to the CUnion.

[20:30] *** dolmen joined
[20:31] <Xliff> It's been a while since I've used unions, so I don't know if $union = nativecast(UnionType, $memberstruct) will "just work"

[20:31] <jnthn> Xliff: Hm, I wonder if it's just a case of making the attribute `is rw` in the union type decl and then assigning into it?

[20:34] *** Manifest0 joined
[20:34] <Xliff> jnthn: For CStucts, using "is rw" is still problematic. I have an open ticket about that.

[20:34] <Xliff> Anyting not a float-based or int-based member will throw an immutable error. 

[20:35] <Xliff> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2589

[20:36] <Xliff> class A is repr('CStruct') { has Str $.s is rw; }; 

[20:36] <Xliff> my $a = A.new( s => 'Hello' );

[20:36] <Xliff> m: class A is repr('CStruct') { has Str $.s is rw; };  my $a = A.new( s => 'Hello' );

[20:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «assign requires a concrete object (got a Str type object instead)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:36] <Xliff> Ah! New error message.

[20:43] *** netrino left
[20:43] <jnthn> m: class A is repr('CStruct') { has Str $.s; }; my $a = A.new( s => 'Hello' ) 

[20:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «assign requires a concrete object (got a Str type object instead)␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[20:44] <jnthn> Not about the `is rw` even. Hmm

[20:45] <tadzik> m: class A is repr('CStruct') { has str $.s; }; my $a = A.new( s => 'Hello' )

[20:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: ( no output )

[20:45] <tadzik> m: class A is repr('CStruct') { has str $.s; }; my $a = A.new( s => 'Hello' ); say $a.s

[20:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Hello␤»

[20:46] <tadzik> I guess that works, unless you really want a proper Str ;)

[20:48] *** netrino joined
[20:48] <Xliff> tadzik: "str"?

[20:48] <Xliff> What's the diff?

[20:49] <Xliff> m: my Str $a = "Hello"; my str $b; $b = $a; $b.say

[20:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Hello␤»

[20:49] <tadzik> it's like int vs Int, one of them is a native type, the other is boxed

[20:49] <Xliff> tadzik: Ah! 

[20:49] <Xliff> Now I have LOADS of code to go over and change... LOL!

[20:50] <tadzik> :D

[20:54] <Xliff> tadzik: While you are here. I am having trouble getting latest rakudobrew to compile moar-master. Is this a known error?

[20:55] <tadzik> Xliff: not to me. To be fair, I'm very active in rakudobrew atm, but I'd rather put the blame on rakudo/moar than rakudobrew, it's pretty dumb when it comes to building things :P

[20:55] <tadzik> what's the errorr/
