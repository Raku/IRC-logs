[01:18] <yoleaux> 3 Apr 2019 03:19Z <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: well, almost every. Most of them for sure

[01:22] <Xliff> NQPHLL is only recognized by nqp, correct?

[01:22] <jackfly26> wdym

[01:22] <jackfly26> i think

[01:23] <Xliff> Commenting out all of "method statement:sym<putln>" reveals a new error.

[01:23] <Xliff> Cannot find method 'language' on object of type NQPMu

[01:24] <jackfly26> huh

[01:24] <MasterDuke> jackfly26: it parse/compiles if you comment out all the putln action

[01:24] <Xliff> Ah! There is no Fly::Language

[01:24] <jackfly26> is that needed

[01:24] <Xliff> Er.

[01:24] <jackfly26> the tutorial mentioned in the repo doesnt show that

[01:24] <Xliff> Fly::Compiler.

[01:25] <jackfly26> oh

[01:25] <jackfly26> its the $comp.language()

[01:25] <jackfly26> so compiler is pretty much null

[01:25] <Xliff> Yes. Fly::Compiler is missing.

[01:26] <jackfly26> i must have accidentally deleted that

[01:26] <Xliff> :)

[01:26] <jackfly26> oh

[01:26] <MasterDuke> ah, think i figured it out. use different quotes around say

[01:27] <jackfly26> the blockoid literally got fixed by double quotes

[01:27] <jackfly26> thats stupid

[01:27] <Xliff> ??

[01:27] <Xliff> Post fix?

[01:28] <MasterDuke> u: ‚Äô

[01:28] <unicodable6> MasterDuke, U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK [Pf] (‚Äô)

[01:28] <Xliff> Oh... wooow

[01:28] <Xliff> :op("say") -- works

[01:29] <Xliff> :op('say') -- works

[01:29] <Xliff> :op(‚Äôsay‚Äô) -- doesn't work

[01:29] <Xliff> Yeah. Wrong quotes.

[01:29] <Xliff> u: '

[01:29] <unicodable6> Xliff, U+0027 APOSTROPHE [Po] (')

[01:30] <MasterDuke> it probably would if it started with a left single quotation mark and ended with a right

[01:30] <jackfly26> wow

[01:30] <jackfly26> ok

[01:31] <MasterDuke> oh, maybe not. guess nqp doesn't support those

[01:31] <jackfly26> it doesnt give any errors but 

[01:31] <Xliff> Yep. 

[01:31] <jackfly26> it still doesnt print out

[01:31] <Xliff> :op('say') -- works

[01:31] <jackfly26> i got that working

[01:31] <Xliff> MasterDuke: You are correct. It parses with left quotation mark.

[01:31] <jackfly26> it just won't print to screen

[01:32] <Xliff> Yeah. Well can't help you further coz missing Fly::Compiler.

[01:32] <jackfly26> oh

[01:32] <jackfly26> lemme post updated code

[01:33] <Xliff> :)

[01:33] <jackfly26> https://hastebin.com/gafiyezefa.xml

[01:38] <MasterDuke> jackfly26: don't you need to eval the input?

[01:39] <jackfly26> no

[01:39] <jackfly26> i think the HLL::Compiler does that

[01:40] <Xliff> After this operation "$output := $output();".... $output is an empty string

[01:40] *** AlexDaniel joined
[01:41] <jackfly26> i just realized i can take everything out of the compiler class

[08:48] <kawaii> Keybase keep a copy of your private key, of course they claim it is all encrypted and secure but as with anything - you will never know.

[08:48] <kawaii> Personally, I've used and trusted the service since it was in closed beta. But I can understand why others might now.

[08:48] <kawaii> not**

[08:49] *** abraxxa joined
[08:50] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: the idea of having a profile with links to multiple sources where your key can be verified is cool, but anything beyond that makes me worried. Like I don't see any good reason for a yet another chat application‚Ä¶ and it looks like someone has sent a file to me, but I can't get it unless I install their thing, apparently? I don't want to install things

[08:50] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: wait what? Why would they have your private key? They definitely don't have mine

[08:50] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: ah well if you used their key generation service (i.e. you didn't previously have a key at all), they store both parts.

[08:51] <AlexDaniel> o_O

[08:51] <kawaii> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/UCiXdp3G/Screenshot%20from%202019-04-04%2009-51-15.png

[08:51] <kawaii> >Export my private key

[08:52] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I think you can download from browser, can't you?

[08:54] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: no

[08:54] <AlexDaniel> not for files, apparently

[08:55] <kawaii> You need to use the desktop or mobile clients to use Keybase chat/filestorage/git etc...

[08:55] <SmokeMachine> maybe you can't if its crypt  with your pub key because they don't have you prove key (neither mine)

[08:56] <AlexDaniel> why can't they just give the encrypted file to me?

[08:57] <AlexDaniel> ok so to install their app they recommend to curl a deb package and install it

[08:57] <AlexDaniel> I don't feel like doing that

[08:58] <SmokeMachine> what about clone theirs repo?

[08:58] <kawaii> Speaking of repos, Debian stable has Rakudo from 2016 - and as far as I can see, we don't have our own upstream Debian repos for Rakudo, do we AlexDaniel?

[08:59] <xq> I've looked at keybase and even have an account, but I've never found a problem that I can solve with it

[08:59] <xq> a hammer looking for a nail

[08:59] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: no repo but there's https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg/releases

[09:00] *** pecastro joined
[09:01] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: also, new debian release is coming this year, hopefully

[09:01] <kawaii> I know a little bit about Debian packaging, maybe we could get something like deb.(rakudo|perl6).org and provide an upstream?

[09:02] *** sftp joined
[09:02] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: we can have our own repo, yes, but I'm not convinced that it's a super useful thing to have

[09:03] <kawaii> Could be, I hardly ever use Debian's own repos for most things (i.e. I use nginx upstream, postgresql upstream...)

[09:03] <kawaii> Most people want bleeding-edge unless it's for a server.

[09:04] <AlexDaniel> people who want bleeding edge stuff use ubuntu, no?

[09:04] <AlexDaniel> and ubuntu comes with updated rakudo like every 6 months

[15:04] <wahnwitz> hi, how can I add a class from another file into my code? :/

[15:04] <wahnwitz> i have multiple files with classes

[15:05] <timotimo> hi

[15:05] <timotimo> usually when you're working on a module, you'll have them in a lib/ folder and outside of that a META6.json with a "provides" section in it that lists them with their names

[15:05] <zostay> I can't get to perl6.org subdomains. I'd search IRC history to see if this was a known problem, but I can't get to irc.perl6.org either to do that. What's up with DNS?

[15:05] <timotimo> then you can "use" them

[15:06] <timotimo> zostay: for me, docs.perl6.org works at least

[15:07] <timotimo> wahnwitz: if you're okay with being more closely bound to paths and directory structure and such, you can "use lib 'blah/';" from your code to put "blah/" into the module search path

[15:08] *** reach_satori left
[15:09] <zostay> Hmm... I wonder if my ISP is doing something stupid. It does not work from either of my laptops, but if I connect to the VPN it switches resolver setups and then it works.

[15:09] <wahnwitz> thx timotimo ..thats what I want

[15:10] <timotimo> usually when i'm developing on one of my modules or have a dependency i'm making changes in i'll use -I flags to point at the module folders

[15:10] <timotimo> either point them at the folder that has the META6.json in it and it'll pick that up, or the lib/ folder

[15:11] <wahnwitz> its just training for now..i have something like this: use lib './classes/Importer.class'; my $imp = Importer.new("blabla");

[15:12] <wahnwitz> still get an "undeclared name" "Importer 

[15:13] <timotimo> yeah, "use lib" is only to add paths to the list

[15:13] <timotimo> and normally perl6 won't pick up files ending in .class

[15:14] <wahnwitz> so i need a use "Importer" than

[15:14] <timotimo> without quotation marks

[15:15] <wahnwitz> ok..now i have an Could not find Importer at line 4 in:     file#/usr/home/Abuse/classes .. its going better :D

[15:16] <wahnwitz> ahh, ok .. with .pm its going well

[15:20] <zostay> Weird. Google's DNS servers won't resolve perl6.org subdomains, but my ISP DNS doesn't have a problem, so I've switched back to that.

[15:21] <wahnwitz> thx timotimo 

[15:22] <moritz> zostay: it has a catchall for the subdomains

[15:23] <moritz> can confirm, dig docs.perl6.org @8.8.8.8 +short comes up short

[16:10] <moritz> it's not an operator that is used often enough to warrant such a shortcut

[18:06] <jmerelo> Anyone around has any idea of Haskell?

[18:06] <yoleaux> 03:54Z <japh> jmerelo: so I asked $wife if she could print the pdf on her laser printer at work, few hours later she called me up, freaking out, "dude, did you ask me to print the whole internet?"

[18:06] <jmerelo> .tell japh that's rich :-)

[18:06] <yoleaux> jmerelo: I'll pass your message to japh.

[18:07] <jmerelo> .tell but that pretty much describes Perl6, yes. "Everything _and_ the kitchen sink"

[18:07] <yoleaux> jmerelo: I'll pass your message to but.

[18:07] <jmerelo> I'll just drop it here: typeclasses are basically like roles in Perl 6?

[18:08] *** chansen_ left
[18:09] *** chansen_ joined
[18:15] <jmerelo> Well, maybe actually like roles with abstract methods. And no instance variables. 

[18:26] <ugexe> conceptually sure

[18:26] *** b2gills left
[18:27] <ugexe> its just you can do things with roles that would not be considered something a typeclass should do

[18:27] <jmerelo> ugexe: like putting state into instance variables. State is bad. Functional languages don't like that.

[18:28] <jmerelo> ugexe: or punning...

[18:28] <jmerelo> ugexe: OK, thanks!

[18:28] <ugexe> you can put default implementations inside of a role, although thats not something an interface should o

[18:28] <ugexe> do

[20:40] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: don't have time to answer now. Just wanna see if it builds. Especially on Win.

[20:40] * vrurg is away now

[20:40] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: briefly: started with adding a new lang specs letter. The decided that overall the configure looks not so good.

[20:42] *** lucasb joined
[20:45] <guifa> If you do something like

[20:45] <guifa> my %data = BEGIN {¬†‚Ä¶ }

[20:45] <guifa> versus

[20:45] <guifa> my %data = INIT {¬†‚Ä¶ }

[20:45] <guifa> Is there any reason that callables that get stored in %data should be any different?

[20:51] <guifa> AHA! There *is* a difference

[20:52] <lucasb> please show

[20:52] <guifa> Although I think it‚Äôs definitely in bug territory.  If you use MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL in a BEGIN block, the callables created with it are basically deemed callables non grata.  If you do it on INIT, they‚Äôre dconsidered acceptable

[21:11] <gabc> Hi, is it normal that the link to smoke testing on the community page gets me a 500 error?

[21:11] <gabc> That page http://smoke.perl6.org/report

[21:11] <timotimo> i wonder when the last time that was mentioned was

[21:12] <timotimo> to the irclog!

[21:12] <gabc> ahah

[21:12] <gabc> I don't know what is a smoke test, I was curious :P

[21:13] <ugexe> http://testers.perl6.org/ still lives though

[21:14] <timotimo> the last report was 2017 though :

[21:14] <timotimo> :)>

[21:15] <timotimo> hm, does the updater for that site still eat up cpu on hack? maybe we should retire it

[21:15] <timotimo> anyway, the smoking stuff has been superceded by Blin

[21:15] <timotimo> but we don't really have a site for blin results; they always just land on github as issues
