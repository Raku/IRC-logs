[00:03] <timotimo> nice.

[00:03] <timotimo> that's surely also friendlier on the GC :)

[00:04] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: that's… not that much data actually? Even if it was fully leaked I'd be fine with it… :D

[00:06] <AlexDaniel> let's say 20kB per query, you'd need to use camelia (m: ) whooping 50 times to leak a 1 MB

[00:08] <timotimo> wellllll

[00:08] <timotimo> depends entirely on how many objects you split the data over :D

[00:28] <Xliff> Yawn...

[00:29] <Xliff> I hate naps. They sneak on you and strike when you least expect them.

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> tobs: why not declare FromDiscord in Discordable.pm6 ?

[00:29] <AlexDaniel> tobs: you'd need to `use Whateverable::Discordable;` in evalable but that's fine

[00:30] <tobs> AlexDaniel: I wanted to keep the `unit role` with less indentation

[00:30] <AlexDaniel> tobs: can't it be inside anyway?

[00:31] *** mowcat joined
[00:31] <tobs> can it? Let me try

[00:32] *** [particle] left
[00:32] <AlexDaniel> also now that I look at it, you don't need `is export` on roles?

[00:36] <tobs> It works when I declare it `my role FromDiscord is export` inside the `unit role`. Without `my` it complains about role scope being too generic

[00:36] <AlexDaniel> I'd prefer that

[00:37] <tobs> test just finished as well

[05:55] <AlexDaniel> oh

[05:56] <tyil> I know there's a Discord module and an IRC::Client module, so it should be reasonably easy to write a similar thing in perl 6

[17:02] <timotimo> guifa: do you mean the second one has a different separator set on the file handle or something?

[17:03] <guifa> First example used  a | b | c | d \n a | b | c | d \n a | b | c | d \n

[17:04] <guifa> (where | is the delimiter, sans spaces but trying to keep it readable here)

[17:04] <guifa> Second example used a \n b \n c \n d \n a \n b \n c \n d \n a \n b \n c \n d \n 

[17:04] <timotimo> ah, ok

[17:09] <guifa> It’s not a huge difference, but the former is about 20% faster. Maybe the optimizer realizes that for $foo.lines { @bar.push: $_.split($delim) } doesn’t need a new context, but the for $foo.lines -> \a, \b, \c, \d { … } does require it?  I remember someone (you or jnthn) talking about that could make post-fixed forms in the past a bit faster

[22:30] <tbrowder> .tell jjmerelo i want to create a new docs page that shows all the valid "opener" chars from the rakudo repo: src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp. the page could also be used for other char sets of interest that have no other home. given the proposal is acceptable, i'm open to suggestions for (1) the file name (Language/?.pod6), (2) the TITLE, (3) the SUBTITLE, and (4) the sort section and order.

[22:30] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to jjmerelo

[23:14] <gdonald> thank you

[23:14] <jnthn> Ah, and also ::(...) is useful if it's a multi-part name too
