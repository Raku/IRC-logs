[13:22] <andreios> i've tried to compile nqp-j with jdk11, and it compiles to 8s bytecode and passes tests just fine. Though one class uses deprecated sun.mics.Unsafe. i've managed to replace it with VarHandles, but apparently the code which uses Unsafe is completely dead or not triggered by any test at least

[13:23] <andreios> I wonder how can I trigger this code from nqp?

[13:24] <El_Che> andreios: visit #perl6-dev, maybe a higher concentration of people that would know

[14:36] <antoniogamiz> how useful is that all methods inherited by cool appears in every class documented?

[14:38] <moritz> some more, some less, and it highly depends on the use case

[14:39] <moritz> if your use case is "somebody is calling .split on a Rat here, I wonder WtD that does?", then it's very useful

[14:51] <moritz> antoniogamiz: it preserves container status (doesn't take a read-only reference of the argument)

[14:54] <antoniogamiz> so if I modify min inside that method the change will be applied to the external var?

[20:50] <Xliff> ufobat_: From what?

[20:51] <ufobat_> Could not find symbol '&compilxe'

[20:51] <Xliff> ufobat_: Is this from your code or rakudo?

[20:51] <ufobat_> thats from rakudo

[20:52] <ufobat_> i mine the &compilxe method that is not found is from my code

[20:52] <ufobat_> but there is ===SORRY!=== before this line

[20:52] <Xliff> ufobat_: Can you gist or pastebin?

[20:52] <ufobat_> and before the sorry line there is regular/expected runtime output

[20:52] <Geth> ¦ doc: taboege self-assigned Create a test to ensure there are no accidental Camelia invocations in examples https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2695

[20:53] <Xliff> I have been using 2019.03.1-278-gc5bc71e3c all day and have not had this problem.

[20:53] <ufobat_> the compilxe method is wrong, but i am confused that i am seing the SORRY in front of it

[20:53] <Xliff> ufobat_: Hm. I've never heard of the compilxe method. Might be above my pay grade. 

[20:54] <moritz> a "git grep" doesn't find anything of that name in either rakudo, nqp or MoarVM

[20:55] <ufobat_> no sorry, I wasn't clear enough, the &compilxe method is one of my methods, not from rakudo itself. i am just confused by the SORRY cause it's a runtime error

[20:55] <ufobat_> not a compile time error that i am seeing

[20:55] <Xliff> Ah. Definitely above my pay grade, then.

[20:55] <ufobat_> plus no stacktrace or no line number or sourcefile name

[20:56] <Xliff> If you use --stagestats does that occur during stage parse?

[20:56] <moritz> ufobat_: have you tried with --ll-exception?

[20:56] <ufobat_> nope

[20:59] <ufobat_> moritz, i dont see how this helps me - https://pastebin.com/tsn7WAbc

[21:00] <ufobat_> Xliff, https://pastebin.com/MhcAnUX9

[21:01] <ufobat_> dont know?

[21:03] <moritz> ufobat_:  from /home/barthm/repos/others/scheme6/lib/Scheme/Compiler.pm6 (Scheme::Compiler):6 is the last line of your own code in the backtrace

[21:03] <moritz> and it looks like you got the binding type check error from there

[21:04] <moritz> why rakudo thinks this is a compile time error is beyond me though

[21:05] <ufobat_> m: sub bar(Array $a) { bar($a[0]) }; say 123; my $a = [1,2,3]; bar($a)

[21:05] <ufobat_> thats more or less what i did wrong

[21:05] <ufobat_> i cant reproduce it as a compile time error in a oneliner

[21:06] <ufobat_> i put the sub into a own file/module and it's still not a compile error

[21:06] <ufobat_> *shrug*

[21:07] <ufobat_> anway! thanks for the help

[21:08] <Xliff> Anyone know what this error means? Cannot resolve caller handle(Pod::Defn{:term("Hap..., :pod-name(/language/039-pod.pod6)

[21:09] <sena_kun> Xliff, apparently, there is a Pod::Defn element in /language/039-pod.pod6 and the script doesn't know how to deal with it

[21:09] <Xliff> Yeah. I thought that might be the case.

[21:10] <Xliff> OK. I will bug it.

[21:10] <sena_kun> we can either look at the usage or patch the script itself

[21:10] <ufobat_> meh, different error, agan compile time error

[21:10] <Xliff> Might want to patch the script. I do not know the intended behavior for it.

[22:23] <masak> "No such method 'cache' for invocant of type 'Mu'" -- what does that error message mean? never gotten it before.

[22:25] <masak> (I am not calling a method 'cache' from my code)

[22:26] <vrurg> masak: --ll-exception?

[22:30] <jnthn> masak: @(blah) desugars into (blah).cache

[22:30] <jnthn> Not sure it that'd explain anything though

[22:31] <masak> I think a parse failed and a Mu got in somewhere

[22:31] <masak> I am indeed doing a @$somevar

[22:31] <timotimo> Mu should be rather rare, though

[22:32] <masak> it's a less than awesome error message, with no real relation between 'cache' and the `@` conversion

[22:33] <jnthn> Since @(...) is just sugar for .cache, they compile into the very same thing

[22:33] *** matiasli1a joined
[22:34] <jnthn> So I don't think there's any currently available way to distinguish them

[22:34] <jnthn> (By the time we need to produce the error)

[22:34] <timotimo> the error message could have a special case for that name

[22:34] <jnthn> So...yes, we'd probably need to mention it in addition

[22:38] <masak> yes, I understand the limitations involved. and I'm not super-happy about adding a special case. just saying it's nice when the error message helps to figure out what's wrong ;)
