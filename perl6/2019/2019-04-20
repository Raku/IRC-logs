[07:30] <jaldhar> Hello, I'm attempting to build 2019.3 MoarVM, nqp and rakudo on Ubuntu LTS.  My MoarVM build is failing with

[07:30] <jaldhar> No rule to make target '3rdparty/cmp/cmp.h',

[07:31] <jaldhar> Which package am I missing?

[07:31] <jmerelo> hi, jaldhar . Where did you download the source?

[07:32] <jaldhar> jmerelo: from git

[07:33] <jaldhar> perl6.org and rakudo.org appear to be down atm

[07:33] <jaldhar> or not responding anyway

[07:33] <jmerelo> jaldhar: right. 

[07:33] <jmerelo> Did you download all three repos from github?

[07:34] <jaldhar> yes but I haven't touched the other two yet.  Just MoarVM

[07:35] <discord6> <timotimo> Jaldhar, die you "got clone" the repo or download a zip or tarball?

[07:35] <jmerelo> jaldhar: is the 3rdparty dir empty? cmp is in a subrepo

[07:35] <discord6> <timotimo> Rakudo.org should be up, but it will not have the rakudo star archives at the moment

[07:37] <jmerelo> jaldhar: as timotimo says, using the tarball is not going to include 3rdparty files. Baseline is, is 3rdparty/* directories are empty, they cannot be if you want to compile

[07:37] <discord6> <timotimo> Anyway, the releases tab on GitHub gives you a broken archive, and probably the same for the download zip button on the top right where there is also the clone url

[07:38] <discord6> <timotimo> We have not been able to figure out how to turn off the releases feature on github

[07:38] <jmerelo> Please note that Rakudo Star is the preferred way to use Perl 6; you might want to use that when it comes back. It's also available from repos.

[07:38] <jaldhar> I just downloaded the tarball.  The cmp directory is empty but that's okay because I want to make .deb files.  So I will just use the existing packages for those libs

[07:38] <discord6> <timotimo> We should totally be able to recognize that situation in configure.pl and give a helpful error message fwiw

[07:39] <jaldhar> but the packaging scripts are out of date so I guess they miss a dependency.  I can't tell what cmp is supposed to be in ubuntu hence my question.

[07:39] <discord6> <timotimo> Ok, I'm not sure if configure.pl allows --with-cmp to take one from the system

[07:39] <discord6> <timotimo> Also, if you're fine with that, we have pre-built Deb packages

[07:40] <discord6> <timotimo> CMP is a messagepack libraby

[07:40] <discord6> <timotimo> Wow libraby what an amazing typo

[07:40] <jaldhar> yeah prebuilt is fine for me but can I access them if rakudo.org is down?

[07:41] <discord6> <timotimo> Rakudo.org should be up, do you get a specific error message? Could be hsts is preventing access

[07:41] <discord6> <timotimo> You can just look for nxadm on GitHub for the packages, they are hosted there

[07:42] <jaldhar> ok let me try...

[07:44] <discord6> <timotimo> Which is to say, rakudo.org currently only does http not Https, if your browser remembers from last time that rakudo org told it to only use Https, that would be the reason

[07:45] *** rindolf joined
[07:45] <jaldhar> timotimo: you said nxadm on github.  I'm not getting any results for that

[07:45] <discord6> <timotimo> Should be a user

[07:45] <jaldhar> ok nevermind

[07:45] <discord6> <timotimo> Https://GitHub com/nxadm/

[07:46] <discord6> <timotimo> I'm on a dreadful internet connection right now

[07:49] <jaldhar> timotimo: I got it but the packaging is a bit strange.  I think I will continue building my own.  I also think I should go to sleep now and try again tomorrow.

[07:49] <jaldhar> timotimo: jmerelo: thanks for your help

[07:49] <discord6> <timotimo> Ok good luck!

[07:49] <jmerelo> jaldhar: good luck!

[07:49] <discord6> <timotimo> And good night

[07:50] <discord6> <timotimo> I'll afkbbl

[12:52] <sena_kun> likely a hardware failure, and holidays happen at the same time. a backup exists at http://perl6.wakelift.de/ and http://docs.perl6.wakelift.de/ for main site and documentation

[12:52] <sena_kun> rakudo.org is up at the backup server, though without binaries, I think

[16:12] <sena_kun> I'd still like to see it resolved, as it makes Comma debugger broken with rakudo 2019.03 (and possibly 2019.04, unless resolved). Considering Comma release was not so long ago, community folks won't see a Comma fix for some months, so I'd expect rakudo to have a fallback support for some more time.

[16:13] <sena_kun> not like I can demand anything, of course

[17:13] <patrickb> tadzik, nine: nine just merged my rakudobrew PR

[17:14] <patrickb> tadzik, nine: for this to actually work it's necessary to also pull the `v1` branch under that name.

[17:14] <patrickb> I didn't even know it's possible for someone not the owner of a personal repository to commit stuff.

[17:15] <tadzik> patrickb: ah, yes, nine has a commit bit probably :)

[17:15] <patrickb> tadzik: Was the merge ok with you?

[17:15] <patrickb> If yes, could you also copy the `v1` branch?

[17:15] <tadzik> patrickb: yes, but did we fix/improve that message situation?

[17:16] <patrickb> Yes I did. That's why the v1 branch is now necessary.

[17:16] <patrickb> I can't create a PR, because the target branch doesn't exist yet.

[17:16] <tadzik> we can just tag the previous commit as a "v1"

[17:16] <tadzik> okay

[17:16] <patrickb> You have to pull it locally and push under that name.

[17:17] <patrickb> It diverted. There is now one change in v1 that is not in master. (A notification at `self-upgrade` that this won't update to latest anymore.)

[17:18] <patrickb> https://github.com/patzim/rakudobrew/commit/ac064b7eb3448aa67ee75e15b5fc0dd910af085a

[17:18] <tadzik> I just tagged bdd060c8886da6049f87ea30fdc01dc457747a18 as v1

[17:18] <tadzik> that was the first commit before your changes

[17:18] <tadzik> I think that'll be sufficient :)

[17:18] <patrickb> tadzik: v1 has another commit!

[17:19] <tadzik> oopsie

[17:20] <tadzik> ok, done now :)

[17:21] <patrickb> tadzik: Looks good, thanks!

[17:24] <tadzik> patrickb: the zsh config fails for me: Couldn't find shell hook implementation for shell '-'.

[17:24] <tadzik> I got the lines from rakudobrew init Zsh

[17:27] <patrickb> tadzik: You need to recreate your .profile line

[17:27] <patrickb> oh! You did?

[17:28] <patrickb> they should list `rakudobrew init Zsh` instead of `rakudobrew init -`

[17:30] <tadzik> oh, I may have both lines now :)

[17:31] <tadzik> that was indeed the case

[17:31] <patrickb> is it working now?

[17:31] * patrickb hopes it does

[17:31] <tadzik> it at least builds moar :)

[17:58] <sena_kun> timotimo, sorry, what env vars?

[17:59] <timotimo> PERL6_HOME and NQP_HOME

[17:59] <timotimo> for the debug launch thing

[18:00] <sena_kun> in rakudo? if that'll work, that's great

[18:04] <timotimo> we'd set it in comma when we launch a perl6 or rather a moar

[18:05] <sena_kun> well, the release is just shipped and I am not sure we can do a release with a hotfix soon

[18:05] <timotimo> oh

[18:05] <sena_kun> so the issue is to make it work without changing anything in Comma

[18:05] <timotimo> right, the problem is *that* way around

[18:05] <sena_kun> that's obvious that we can patch that, but

[18:06] <timotimo> sorry for the noise :)

[18:06] <sena_kun> no problem. :)

[21:18] <El_Che> lol, I wanted to build packages for Ubuntu 19.04 and wondered why it failed. Then I realised our upstream is down :)

[21:19] *** Yary joined
[21:19] <sena_kun> yes. :|

[21:19] <Yary> I'm having trouble opening http://perl6.org - any idea on that site's health?

[21:20] <moritz> yes, it's down

[21:20] <El_Che> It's temporarely down

[21:20] <El_Che> Yary: do you need something specific?

[21:20] <moritz> https://twitter.com/perl6org/status/1119234204221562882

[21:21] <Yary> thanks for that link. I'm at a Perl6 study group and we can't get to the docs. I'll check at archive.org

[21:21] <El_Che> http://docs.perl6.wakelift.de/

[21:22] <Yary> ah yes saw that in the tweet too! That works for us

[21:26] <discord6> <Tyler (Aearnus)> perl6 study group? sounds exciting

[21:51] <Yary> We're in Oakland California, one of the perlmonger organizers has been doing it off and on for a year or two

[21:52] <Yary> I'm encouraging him to get on this irc...

[21:55] *** Mutter joined
[21:55] <Mutter> hi there

[21:55] <sena_kun> Mutter, hi

[21:56] <Mutter> I cant reach perl6.org for three hours now...

[21:56] <Mutter> something wrong?

[21:56] <Yary> I had the same q! see https://twitter.com/perl6org/status/1119234204221562882

[21:56] <Yary> docs are up at http://docs.perl6.wakelift.de/ temporarily

[21:57] <sena_kun> Mutter, that's a known issue, likely due to hardware failure on the provider side... not much we can do with holidays, but there are backups running for perl6.org and docs.perl6.org

[21:57] <Mutter> Danke schon

[21:57] <sena_kun> zef module installation also works, though with a 2 minute delay

[21:57] <ugexe> 6 minute

[21:57] <ugexe> two p6c mirrors, 180s timeout each

[21:58] <sena_kun> ah, indeed

[21:58] <sena_kun> then 6 minutes. :(

[22:04] <ugexe> although you can do `touch ~/.zef/store/p6c/p6c.json` if you already have downloaded the index previously

[22:05] <ugexe> to update the last modified time to be less than 1 hour, thus bypassing fetching the index

[22:35] <timotimo> ugexe: maybe we should put that on twitter as well, and on the reddit post

[22:36] <ugexe> in that case might want to suggest just downloading it directly with curl or something

[22:37] <timotimo> you mean the p6c.json file?

[22:38] *** SCHAPiE left
[22:39] <ugexe> curl -L -o ~/.zef/store/p6c/p6c.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/master/p6c1.json

[22:39] <discord6> <Tyler (Aearnus)> could ask people to add an entry to their hosts file for the time being
