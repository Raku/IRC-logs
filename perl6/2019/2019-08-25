[09:37] <ufobat> why does the Backtrace.new.list.elems not reflect to the number of calls I made to a()

[09:39] <ufobat> i am playing around with recursive calls, and I wand to find out how "deep" I am in the recursion. I was hoping that Backtrace can help me out 

[09:39] <ufobat> but the maximum depth I get is 101

[09:42] <ufobat> perl5 yielded a "Deep recoursion", since i dont considder 101 to be quite deep.. Is there a way I could for example rather terminate my programm then consuming all the memory :)  

[09:43] <jmerelo> ufobat: I'm not sure you can access memory used from Perl 6 unless you use something like POSIX calls

[09:52] <ufobat> I was assuming that Backtrace contains a list of all Backtrace::Frames. could it be a bug? 

[09:52] <jmerelo> ufobat: it's probably limited for some reason; also probably you can change that. Check the source and/or raise an issue in the documentation.

[09:56] <ufobat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Backtrace.pm6#L316 <- looks like its limited

[10:00] <jmerelo> ufobat: that was a very safe bet. You can either request from Rakudo to include that as a configuration option, or request from documentation to document that. Or both...

[20:03] <moritz> Precompiling templates from src/jit/core_templates.expr

[20:03] <moritz> "pairkeys" is not exported by the List::Util module

[20:04] <timotimo> interesting, did we accidentally depend on a too new perl5 for that?

[20:04] <timotimo> i mean, it's a development-time dependency

[20:04] <moritz> build-time dependency

[20:04] <timotimo> so not nearly as critical as what we have in Configure.pl and such

[20:04] <moritz> this is from the rakudo build log

[20:05] <moritz> and a perl 5.20 cannot build moarvm right now, it seems

[20:05] *** |oLa| left
[20:05] <moritz> (I assume it's moar, not rakudo directly

[20:05] <timotimo> it's not supposed to have to work with core_templates.expr

[20:06] <moritz> https://gist.github.com/moritz/3dc056e66acdcdeda4fc5073203a9d16

[20:06] <moritz> with a bit more context

[20:07] <Grinnz> 5.20.0 should have List::Util 1.38 which is new enough for pair functions

[20:08] <timotimo> maybe the linux distro in question removes 90% of perl5 modules from the core

[20:08] <Grinnz> then it wouldn't have List::Util at all

[20:10] <timotimo> who knows! maybe they cut out individual lines from the module to minimize it even further

[20:10] <Grinnz> that's not a thing anyone does, except PAR packer with pod

[20:11] <El_Che> Grinnz: it is on long lived distros like Centos

[20:12] <timotimo> *shruuuuug*

[20:12] <Grinnz> no, the second thing

[20:12] <El_Che> (they change course, but Centos 6 and 7 are still there)

[20:12] <Grinnz> also they didn't change course, they just named it better

[20:13] <El_Che> potato - earth apple (the litteral translation of the dutch name)

[20:13] <moritz> it has List::Util 1.38

[20:14] <Grinnz> my guess is that the wrong perl is being used

[20:14] <moritz> possible

[20:15] *** atweiden-air joined
[20:15] <moritz> ah yes, crontab...

[20:15] *** aborazmeh left
[20:16] <Grinnz> any perl older than 5.20 would need to update their List::Util

[20:16] <moritz> where the bashrc doesn't activate perlbrew

[20:16] <Grinnz> absolute paths to perls in cron, always ;)

[20:25] * guifa just watched the video from Riga that talked about perl6 / javascript.

[20:25] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> Hello

[20:25] <Xliff> Do roles allow for a :U: type smiley

[20:25] <guifa> I had no idea it was so far along.  Now I feel like a bit of a fool for creating a fairly cruddy rudimentary parser in JS when I could have just copied the grammar over lol

[20:27] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> m: say (2 + 1);

[20:27] <guifa> p6: role Foo { ; }; class Bar does Foo { ; }; sub xyz (Foo:U $foo) { say "yes" }; xyz(Foo)

[20:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar: OUTPUT: «sudo: /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst/bin/perl6-m: command not found␤»

[20:27] <guifa> m: role Foo { ; }; class Bar does Foo { ; }; sub xyz (Foo:U $foo) { say "yes" }; xyz(Foo)

[20:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar : OUTPUT: «sudo: /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst/bin/perl6-m: command not found␤»

[20:27] <guifa> o.O

[20:28] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> Alas.

[20:28] *** ravenous_ left
[20:28] *** |oLa| joined
[20:28] <guifa> Anyways, Xliff: yes they do.  (I was trying to be cute and have it respond with “yes” lol)

[20:28] <Xliff> guifa: How about within the role, itself. ;)

[20:29] <Xliff> m: role A { method B (A:U:) { say "N

[20:29] <Xliff> m: role A { method B (A:U:) { say "Boo!" }; }; class AA does A { }; AA.B

[20:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar : OUTPUT: «sudo: /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst/bin/perl6-m: command not found␤»

[20:30] <Xliff> Well... :(

[20:30] <Xliff> mrole A { method B (A:U:) { say "Boo!" }; }; class AA does A { }; AA.B

[20:30] <Xliff> role A { method B (A:U:) { say "Boo!" }; }; class AA does A { }; AA.B

[20:30] <evalable6> Xliff, rakudo-moar 2b52e0f55: OUTPUT: «Boo!␤»

[20:30] <Xliff> \o/

[20:31] * guifa ’s answer holds haha

[20:31] <Xliff> Yes. Yes it does! :)
