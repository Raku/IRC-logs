[09:50] <nadim_> founf another dd quirk I believe

[09:50] <nadim_> lizmat: what do you think?

[09:50] *** wamba joined
[09:51] *** Manifest0 left
[09:51] <lizmat> it's not a quirk, it's a side effect of it becoming a named parameter

[09:53] <lizmat> and using the (|) signature

[09:54] <nadim_> ok but shouldn it be dump to something which shows the contents? 

[09:54] <nadim_> m: dd a => 2 

[09:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «block <unit>()␤»

[09:54] <nadim_> m:  a => (< a >, b => 2).perl

[09:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: ( no output )

[09:55] <lizmat> I vaguely recall trying to do just that, and losing some type of info

[09:55] <lizmat> m: dd (a => (< a >, b => 2))

[09:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «:a(("a", :b(2)))␤»

[09:55] <lizmat> ah yes, if I use |c, I cannot get at the name of a variable anymore

[09:56] <lizmat> m: my $a = 42; dd $a   

[09:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Int $a = 42␤»

[09:56] <lizmat> would then not work anymore

[09:56] <lizmat> I figured that was more useful than needing to do an extra set of params when trying to dd a Pair

[15:58] <Xliff> Yeah. Still getting a SEGV.

[15:59] <Xliff> I will gist.

[15:59] <tobs> Xliff: independently of it being const, I believe cglobal() gets variables out of libraries.

[17:24] <El_Che> sena_kun: I wrote a typical LDAP-admin script today (like we talked about), you want me to paste it somewhere?

[17:24] <sena_kun> El_Che, sure

[17:24] <sena_kun> El_Che, well, I guessed that

[17:25] <sena_kun> El_Che, would be a bit more helpful to try to do a port and then create issues for everything that is missing or doesn't work, but I can as well look at it myself, probably

[17:26] <El_Che> sena_kun: sure

[17:26] <El_Che> sena_kun: it's short, so it should be even shorter in p6

[17:32] *** dwarring left

[17:33] <El_Che> sena_kun: it's always so impressive to see how much boilerplate can be dropped when converting p5 to p6

[17:34] <sena_kun> from what I know immediately, StartTLS doesn't work(we have ldaps instead), also extensions are not supported yet, controls are supported

[17:35] <Xliff> lizmat: Thanks. See above. I was using %% instead of %

[17:46] <sena_kun> oooooh, cool

[17:46] <sena_kun> El_Che++

[17:46] <sena_kun> El_Che, is SASL used?

[17:46] <El_Che> sena_kun: the ldap_modify is the only thing calling ldap

[17:46] <El_Che> no; simple auth

[17:46] <sena_kun> El_Che, ldaps?

[17:46] <El_Che> (on ssl)

[17:46] <El_Che> yes, but the code is protocol agnostic

[17:46] <El_Che> it expect an URI

[17:46] <El_Che> s

[17:47] <sena_kun> yup, seeing this

[17:47] <El_Che> just ran it on out production db and haven't got any calls yet :)

[17:47] <sena_kun> well, right now I don't see anything that cannot be written with Cro::LDAP

[17:47] <El_Che> the ldap server is provisioned by an IAM system

[17:47] <sena_kun> as all features are in place already

[17:47] <El_Che> but it can not set pwdChangedTime

[17:48] <El_Che> as it's an operational attribute

[17:48] <El_Che> password resets are done through the IAM system

[17:48] <El_Che> but the pwdChangeTime is useful for stuff using that to trigger password changes from users

[17:48] <El_Che> like our Shibboleth SSO IDP

[17:48] <El_Che> I wrote some code to keep it in sync, but it's in Go

[17:49] <El_Che> this small script is just meant to rectify history mismatches and/or if something goed wrong with the service doing this

[17:49] <El_Che> it would be extremely cool if it would be in native perl6 :)

[17:50] <El_Che> so, does cro-ldap support operational aatributes?

[17:50] <El_Che> (the Relax control in the sub)

[17:50] <sena_kun> El_Che, Relax is supported

[17:51] <sena_kun> El_Che, https://github.com/Altai-man/cro-ldap/blob/master/docs/reference/cro-ldap-client.md#controls <- https://github.com/Altai-man/cro-ldap/blob/b001997493da7151eaae4cecca4629cdcf51fd52/lib/Cro/LDAP/Control.pm6#L26

[17:51] <El_Che> nice

[17:51] <sena_kun> once again, I don't see anything that cannot be done with cro-ldap right now, so

[17:51] <sena_kun> El_Che, I will try to rewrite ldap_modify sub part in Perl 6 and then post the code

[17:52] <El_Che> thx, I'll post the rest

[17:52] <sena_kun> s/post/port/ ? :)

[17:52] <El_Che> I must say the Perl 5 code is single-threader but damn fast

[17:52] <El_Che> yes, port

[17:52] <sena_kun> ok

[17:52] <El_Che> (depending on time of course)

[17:53] <sena_kun> sure

[17:53] <sena_kun> anyway, got it, thanks a lot. I am having a rest day today, so cannot promise anything, but at least I plan to make some docs-related work along with cro-ldap related work

[17:53] <sena_kun> El_Che, I'll ping or .tell you when the results will be available

[17:54] <El_Che> sena_kun: you see how slow I am to react, so don't feel any pressure what so ever

[17:55] <El_Che> sena_kun: it was a fun little script (it's been a while), but I see how much I missed the p6 error messages

[20:24] <kybr> okay. i found the text that i mentioned.. it is Lenz 2017 Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars. he describes a recursive descent parser and an operator-precedence parser. i don't know why i remembered these as limitations of perl 6. they are just specific examples.
