[05:31] <elcaro> because it affects the class globally

[05:31] <elcaro> also, calling subs in a method form (ie. 4.&foo calls foo(4))

[05:31] <elcaro> is pretty easy, further reducing the need to add methods to core classes

[06:50] <holyghost> 2 blockers only, so there's gonna be a second 2019

[06:51] <holyghost> I used a 2018.10 for the netbsd release, I might wait on the latest 2019

[06:52] <holyghost> AFAIK there's only a 10 year old perl6 release on ubuntu

[06:52] <holyghost> so I hope I can cope, netbsd is Ken's BSD

[06:53] <holyghost> then there's fedora who also need a release

[06:54] <holyghost> there's a link to help them out but everything can probably not be managed by a mere hacker 

[06:54] <holyghost> I mean, they probably release themselves

[06:55] <holyghost> you cannot get into their package system IIRC

[06:58] <holyghost> anyway HAND jmerelo 

[07:03] <holyghost> ooh, Castlevania sounds on my internet radio 

[07:09] <jmerelo> Hi

[07:10] <holyghost> You're probably fixing the 2 blockers JJ

[07:11] <holyghost> I'll wait for next release then (see above)

[07:16] *** Xliff joined
[07:18] <jmerelo> holyghost: not me. I don't do much with the core; I stick to what I kinda know, which is the documentation.

[07:21] <xinming_> Anyone knows how I can compile perl6 code to js, So I can run it with node?

[07:21] <xinming_> nodejs*?

[07:24] <holyghost> jmerelo : I have enough problems already with keeping up with the docs of my modules

[07:24] <holyghost> I know though, docs hackers are well respected

[07:25] <jmerelo> xinming_: I don't know if you can do that. You can, however, run rakudo.js to use perl 6 on a js virtual machine, including node, probably.

[08:44] <yoleaux> 27 Apr 2019 11:44Z <holyghost> Xliff: I'm going to upload my old server home directories to my holyghost account, they should be cherished as it's all my software during 10 years

[08:44] <yoleaux> 27 Apr 2019 11:45Z <holyghost> Xliff: they're tarballs home-X.tar.gz, thanks for looking :-)

[08:45] <Xliff> holyghost: I may have to take the machine down in the very near future. I will need to perform some maintenance on it as it ran out of space, today.

[08:57] <holyghost> so p6- or something, just a guess

[08:57] <holyghost> for the modules I mean

[08:59] <holyghost> Xliff : do you know anyone who can webspace them ?

[08:59] <holyghost> some perl6 wakelift.de server or something ?

[09:03] <El_Che> holyghost: 4 years ago? 4 years ago perl 6 wasn't even released!

[09:03] <holyghost> parrot was perl6 then

[09:04] <holyghost> in ubuntu then you could install perl6 as a package whihc was parrot

[09:04] <El_Che> yes, so irrelevant for packages

[09:05] <El_Che> anyway, it's been a while since popular distro have recent packages on recent releases

[09:05] <holyghost> it was perl6 from 2013 I believe

[09:05] <holyghost> sure

[09:05] <El_Che> yeah, a dead born experiment

[09:05] <holyghost> people need to cope with our release schedule

[09:05] <holyghost> I know

[09:05] <holyghost> debian/ubuntu is ok then

[09:06] <El_Che> on Linux there is no problem. Do you need recent, well integrated packages? Use the ones included in the distro? Do you want standalone monthly releases? Use the rakudo packages

[09:06] <El_Che> macos is also fine

[09:07] <El_Che> homebrew has the monthly rakudo as well

[09:40] *** domidumont left
[09:41] <holyghost> El_Che : right, rakudo is it now

[09:42] <holyghost> the fact is we do not have CORBA though, what they wanted to acheive for perl

[09:43] <holyghost> parrot was not just a single language, the meaning was we could translate to several languages in perl

[09:44] <holyghost> though perl6 is cool as it is

[10:03] <holyghost> right

[10:03] <Xliff> Can't you split things up?

[10:04] <Xliff> Upload only what you need right nao

[10:04] <holyghost> ok w8

[10:04] <Woodi> actually Perl6 taking so long allowed to include quite a few features. and skip few like STM...

[10:09] <ugexe> so use a usb stick?

[10:10] <holyghost> else I deposit 5$ 

[10:10] <Woodi> I think I'm still fuzzy about grammars... in v5 regexes was mainly for grepping over text. And v6 announces grammar as better regexes. So I try to use grammars as regexes in v5 but always ending in work to implement whole grammar for text format I want to work with... so I have ability to validate whole text. but I just wanted to extract some information...

[10:33] <Woodi> holyghost: I have this book. also recomend it :)  but my problem with grammars is more in use-case category...

[10:33] <holyghost> my boss is a smalltalk overlord so I had to jump on

[10:33] <holyghost> I'm hack code for her

[10:34] <holyghost> that's everything I do for PF and Pm Brussels and the VUB

[10:34] <Woodi> holyghost: smalltalk still use MVC as in Viewer modifies Model ?

[10:34] <holyghost> Woodi : I'm not too good in grammars but you have to understand the features of s// and so on

[10:35] <holyghost> Woodi : smalltalk has been Squeak and Pharo.org in recent years, there's also dolphin smalltalk for windows

[10:35] <holyghost> USENET knows this :-)

[10:36] <holyghost> there's patents from Adele in there, IBM IIRC

[10:36] <jmerelo> Woodi: if regexes are not enough, or you have nested regexes, or simply want to have a more structured way of processing text, use grammars.

[10:37] <holyghost> Woodi : as jmerelo says

[10:38] <jmerelo> m: say $*PERL.compiler.version.gist

[10:38] <evalable6> jmerelo, rakudo-moar cac95fbbc: OUTPUT: «v2019.03.1.252.gcac.95.fbbc␤»

[10:38] <Woodi> jmerelo: I think I would like tutorial how to replace nested regexes with grammar... or maybe just how to write grammar that is not full text format specification :)

[10:39] <jmerelo> Woodi: I wrote a few in dev.to

[10:39] <Woodi> jmerelo: link ?

[10:39] <jmerelo> Woodi: here's the first: https://dev.to/jj/introduction-to-grammars-with-perl6-75e

[10:39] <holyghost> Woodi : as I understand, jmerelo is our docs wizard

[10:40] <jmerelo> Woodi: I also wrote about them in the Perl6 calendar

[10:40] <jmerelo> holyghost: this wizard would be a happy wizard if more people helped with the documentation.

[10:40] <holyghost> aaagh, then I cannot hack :-)

[10:41] *** Xliff left
[10:41] <Woodi> I wonder do I stated my problem clear... my main problem is not with using grammar or regexes :)  but checking post

[10:41] <jmerelo> Woodi: here's all the tagged articles: https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/tag/grammar/ some are easier than other...

[10:41] *** domidumont joined
[10:42] <jmerelo> Woodi: as I said above, if you're good with regexes, stick with that. But if you're using a regex to extract a pattern that you're analyzing later with another regex, that's grammar's turf

[10:42] <holyghost> Woodi : what are you doing with your code ?

[10:42] <holyghost> jmerelo can probably help you out with an example, or me more or less

[10:43] <Woodi> holyghost: ATM I just parse some reports with numbers :)

[10:43] <holyghost> right :-)

[10:44] <holyghost> in Excell ? :-)

[10:45] <jmerelo> Woodi: since they probably have a line structure, and they're separated by some, well, separator, it's likely that you don't even need regexes

[10:45] <Woodi> holyghost: no, perl 5 :)  plus I have project that codes that in Perl 6. but performance is 20 times worse and groving...

[10:45] <jmerelo> Woodi: however, if you do extract first numbers from lines, and then parse what's in a cell, a simple grammar that would parse lines or whole tables would probably be a good way of dealing with it.

[10:46] <holyghost> Woodi : perl 5 should do, I once parsed 5000 genetic algorithms with it

[10:46] <holyghost> then put that to gnuplot.info

[10:47] <Woodi> jmerelo: I have script that succesfully use grammar for that. my *fuzzy* problem is that I needed to write whole format specification as grammar...

[10:48] <jmerelo> Woodi: that's a different thing altogether. If you mean some MARFA grammar or similar, I think there's a Perl 6 module for that. But grammars in perl 6 can't be inicialized with grammar notations such as BNF or similar.

[10:48] <jmerelo> Woodi: if you have the grammar in Perl 6 already, might not be too difficult to transcribe it to some reasonable format.

[10:49] <holyghost> Woodi : write more code I guess

[10:51] <holyghost> regexes should do for number parsing, IIRC

[10:51] <Woodi> I'm not scientist... just use regexes... and Perl 6 says: grammars are better regexes ! and then I land with working on whole text format specification...

[10:52] <Woodi> so probably my fault but I just do as advertised :)

[10:53] <jmerelo> Woodi: grammars _are_ better regexes. But if you don't show a bit of text, what you've done with it, and what you intend to do with it, it's kinda difficult to help you

[10:53] <jmerelo> Woodi: because there are grammars and grammars. grammars in perl6 are programs, but if you want to specify some grammar using conventional grammar notation, that's a different thing.

[10:54] <holyghost> as jmerelo says, I do not understand why you should not use a regex

[11:02] <Woodi> jmerelo: example could be: find what is inside '<tr> ... </tr>' in html pages using grammar. it is easy with nested regexes. but with grammar I somehow got a habit of implementing whole HTML grammar. and every tutorial about grammars do just that: they implement grammar for EVERYTHING in text format :)  I did not met any post/tutorial that says: skip headers, body and table just get what you interested in. 

[11:02] <Woodi> so efectively using grammar as regex ...

[11:02] <Woodi> ... :)  so just other use-case

[11:03] <jmerelo> Woodi: you can use a table to regex to extract the table and then a grammar... Don't need to overengineer.

[11:03] * jmerelo goes AFK to vote right now.

[11:03] <holyghost> you just do embedded < and >

[11:03] *** jmerelo left
[11:03] <Woodi> jmerlo: GL !

[11:03] <holyghost> then parse your system

[11:04] <holyghost> ok, so I'm on my own now :-)

[11:04] <holyghost> Woodi : try to parse the < and > with a variable++ and variable--

[11:05] <holyghost> then adjust with the keyword such as body or tr

[11:05] <Woodi> holyghost: that is just example of use case :)

[11:05] <holyghost> you can write a html2txt with that

[11:06] <holyghost> anyway, I'm also afk for a while unless you need me, I am getting my wine on sunday done :o|

[11:09] <Woodi> don't be too familiar with wine...

[19:22] <xinming_> and   `node node_modules/rakudo/rakudo.js`    worked.

[19:23] <xinming_> How do I list all $? variables in perl6?

[19:27] <xinming_> For now, Need ideas to use pg modules from node instead of DBIish

[19:36] <MasterDuke> m: .say for (MY::.keys, OUR::.keys, CORE::.keys, GLOBAL::.keys, PROCESS::.keys, COMPILING::.keys).flat.grep(*.substr(1, 1) eq "?")

[19:37] <MasterDuke> xinming_: ^^^

[19:38] <xinming_> MasterDuke: Thanks.

[19:39] <MasterDuke> np

[19:40] <Voldenet> MasterDuke: not sure if I should report that in rakudo, nqp or moarvm repo - i'm guessing NQP is the right place

[19:41] <MasterDuke> Voldenet: i'd start at rakudo, it can always be moved if needed. but that probably has more eyes on than the other two

[19:42] <Voldenet> okay, will do that

[19:42] <xinming_> My web will be written in perl6. :-)

[19:42] <xinming_> Never feel that is so close after I try rakudo.js today.

[23:18] <guifa> Ah, I didn’t realize so much of that was being done on the fly.  I figured it was hard coded with each build of Rakudo

[23:19] *** rindolf left
[23:21] <raschipi> Well, you can't do it at build time, because it's entirely pausible that one distro will be used to build for many others.

[23:23] <guifa> Fair.  I’m just trying to think o fother values to check for for the UserLanguage module.  Right now I can confirm it checks okay for linux/windows/mac, but other *nix builds I don’t know what their values look like.  And it looks like it’s pulling those from ENV variables so… I’m just gonna have to wait until someone uses P6 on one of those systems and sends me a message :-)

[23:24] *** abraxxa left
[23:27] <ToddAndMargo> Anyone on newbie duty?

[23:28] <ToddAndMargo> What is the proper way to path a module in a non-standard directory?   Apparently " use lib /xxxx'" gets me into speed trouble starting up, especially is it is used in a moduels that calls other modules.

[23:35] *** xi- left
[23:36] <raschipi> ToddAndMargo Yeah, searching recursively for any modules can take a whiel, I guess. I sugest puting META6.json https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6.json-META6.json files and listing everything there so that you avoid the recursive search

[23:36] *** xi- joined
[23:36] <ToddAndMargo> Thank you!

[23:41] <raschipi> np

[23:43] <raschipi> ToddAndMargo: You can also tell zef to install your module from the directory: zef install ./your-module-folder so that they get precompiled and are found fast.

[23:46] <ToddAndMargo> will do.  META6.json is way over my head

[23:47] <ToddAndMargo> This normal?  $ zef install /home/linuxutil/p6lib No meta file? Path: /home/linuxutil/p6lib

[23:54] <raschipi> Hum, perhaps zef needs the META6.json file. meta6 can create meta6.json files for you: https://github.com/gfldex/perl6-meta6-bin

[23:56] <ToddAndMargo> give me a bit to check.  It may be an hour or so
