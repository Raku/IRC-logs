[13:50] <finanalyst> Is there anyone here that could help me with an optimisation issue? I've written a new module to replace Pod::To::HTML but it is 3x slower, and I'm trying to work out why

[13:53] <timotimo> sure

[13:53] <timotimo> finanalyst: i'm the moarperf developer, so that's kind of sort of my job :P

[13:56] <finanalyst> great. I have run `time raku --doc=HTML small-prog` and got real:0.2ms, user:0.3s,sys:0.0ms, then run `time raku -Ilib --doc=HTML small-prog` and got r:2.1ms, u:3.2ms, s:0.1` 

[13:57] <finanalyst> When I ran raku with --profile, however, the standard module uses more time than the new one

[13:58] <finanalyst> So, for standard 'The profiled code ran for 139.28ms', while new is 'The profiled code ran for 81.16ms'

[13:59] <timotimo> ok, interesting

[13:59] <finanalyst> This indicates to me that my actual code is more efficient, but that it is calling an inefficient module (Template::Mustache)

[13:59] <timotimo> can you try --stagestats to see if there's any precompilation going on?

[13:59] <timotimo> the profiler should also show time spent in modules you're using

[13:59] <timotimo> oh, also

[13:59] <timotimo> the html profiler doesn't do multithreaded stuff

[13:59] <timotimo> you'll want moarperf for that

[14:00] <finanalyst> timotimo: i'll try stagestats, but I can't find module information easilty, the graphs are a bit difficult to interpre

[14:01] <finanalyst> Both codes use a >> on the pod-tree, but for the simple files there is only one very short Pod::Block, so that should not affect performance

[14:02] <timotimo> would you be willing to give moarperf a try?

[14:02] <finanalyst> I tried both on the largest pod file in docs/ but the same timing ratio seemed to be showing up, eg. my modules is 3x slower

[14:03] <finanalyst> By the way, I have handled double calls to render by the raku  compiler using a state variable

[14:04] <finanalyst> timotimo: moarperf, sure. where and how to get/use it?

[14:04] <timotimo> https://github.com/timo/moarperf/releases/tag/untagged-5c24c51440646d6875ae

[14:04] <timotimo> it's a little cro app

[14:04] <timotimo> you'll want to --profile=/tmp/profile.sql to get a compatible output file

[14:04] <timotimo> or if your rakudo is a little older it'll be --profile --profile-filename=/tmp/profile.sql

[14:04] <finanalyst> looking

[14:05] <finanalyst> I have Rakudo version 2019.07.1 built on MoarVM version 2019.07.1

[14:05] <finanalyst> do I need to update?

[14:05] <timotimo> nope, that's new enough by far

[14:06] <finanalyst> timotimo: installation instruction?

[14:06] <timotimo> "zef install --deps-only ."

[14:07] <timotimo> if you want it faster --/tests will help

[14:07] <finanalyst> great

[14:07] <timotimo> then perl6 -I. service.p6 /tmp/profile.sql

[14:07] <timotimo> if you could check the readme and point out possible improvements, that'd be appreciated

[14:07] <timotimo> maybe an INSTALLING file?

[14:08] <finanalyst> I'll look now.

[14:26] <Woodi> hi #perl6 :)

[14:27] <Woodi> "PHP7 will release FFI at the end of _next_ month" :)  and our lovely lang already have it for how many years ? :)  https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=PHP-7.4-FFI-Good-Shape

[14:56] <finanalyst> timotimo: downloaded moarperf and will test and look at help etc. BUT also ran stagestats on both. Big difference

[14:57] <finanalyst> For standard module, stage parse: 0.133, for myMod, stage parse 2.128

[14:58] <timotimo> stage parse includes loading modules

[14:58] <timotimo> in an even newer rakudo --stagestats will display other "nested" stagestats

[14:58] <timotimo> like for modules that are precompiled on demand

[14:59] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/7636a953266519f0d0a214056fabc9e1 - here's an example for moarperf

[14:59] <finanalyst> This found the answer mostly. I had a 'no precompilation' in one of my classes for debugging

[14:59] <timotimo> perfect

[15:00] <finanalyst> Thank you! 

[15:01] <timotimo> you're very welcome

[15:02] <timotimo> actually, the profiler could totally record the time-since-vm-start-when-profiling-was-initiated

[15:02] <timotimo> and the frontend could suggest "hey btw the profiler only recorded the last 5% of execution time; maybe you want to check if compilation is slow?"

[15:03] <finanalyst> I think it would have helped if the information from stagestats could be included in the profiler overview

[15:03] <finanalyst> and like what you just said
