[03:46] <atweiden-air> can anyone on macos with rakudo 2019.11 installed do me a huge favor?

[03:46] <atweiden-air> i'm trying to update the macos homebrew formula to 2019.11, it builds fine, but test is failing:

[03:46] <atweiden-air> cd nqp-2019.11; cd src/vm/moar/stage0; moar nqp.moarvm -e 'for (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) { print($_) }'

[03:46] <atweiden-air> this test passes on void linux with MoarVM-2019.11, so i think it must be macos-related

[03:46] <atweiden-air> i can't install moar-2019.11 with either p6env or rakudobrew, so i have no way of see if this test failure is being caused by system libs on macos

[03:47] <atweiden-air> can someone who has 2019.11 installed on macos run this test using the nqp-2019.11 source code release?

[03:47] <atweiden-air> cd nqp-2019.11; cd src/vm/moar/stage0; moar nqp.moarvm -e 'for (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) { print($_) }'
