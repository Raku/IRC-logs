[11:17] <sjn> One thing I'm missing in 89 is a few words about pre-annoucing the Raku name-change

[11:19] <sjn> so where some perl6 things may get a deprecation message, wouldn't it make sense that equivalent raku things get an "apprecation" message before the change?

[12:39] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> That would be unexpected, in my opinion. If you're already using Raku methods, nothing should appear and everything should work as expected. An exception would be if people are using Raku methods before they're implemented, which would be just cause to display that kind of message.

[12:40] <discord6> <RaycatWhoDat> But then, I would wonder if some sort of bridge/migration library would be required.

[13:34] <Doc_Holliwood> ok... check a files content without reading it

[13:34] <Doc_Holliwood> piece of cake

[13:35] <Doc_Holliwood> No, seriously, that's impossible, isn't it?

[13:36] <Doc_Holliwood> unless you rely on file magic, but technically that's "reading" too

[13:36] <scimon> Yeah... 

[13:54] <scimon> Perl5 is easy enough use the -T test and pretend you're not reading the file.

[13:55] <lizmat> sadly, -T is not implemented in https://modules.perl6.org/dist/P5-X:cpan:ELIZABETH

[13:55] <lizmat> patches welcome  :-)

[14:05] <scimon> :D

[14:08] * Doc_Holliwood interprets "reading" as "your own program is reading"

[16:43] <uzl[m]> o/

[16:46] <uzl[m]> I know from the definition it might not be possible but could I bind to a variable in an array by pushing to the array instead of using binding assignment?

[16:46] <Xliff> Hey, uzl!

[16:46] <uzl[m]> m: my $x = 5; my @a; @a[0] := $x; (@a[0] =:= $x).say

[16:46] <uzl[m]> Hi, Xliff!

[16:47] *** domidumont joined
[16:47] <Xliff> uzl: I don't see how you could do that without a bind somewhere.

[16:48] <uzl[m]> Instead of @a[0] := $x;, I'd use @a.push($x) which would bind  $x to the end of the array's container.

[16:48] <Xliff> my $x = 'some value'; my $y := $x; my @a = <a b c d>; @a.push: $x; @a.say; $b;

[16:48] <Xliff> m: my $x = 'some value'; my $y := $x; my @a = <a b c d>; @a.push: $x; @a.say; $b;

[16:48] <Xliff> m: my $x = 'some value'; my $y := $x; my @a = <a b c d>; @a.push: $x; @a.say; $y.say;

[16:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: ¬´[a b c d some value]‚ê§some value‚ê§¬ª

[16:49] <Xliff> uzl[m]: But that's only until something else is pushed on to @a

[16:50] <Xliff> my @a = <a b c d e>; my $x := @a[* - 1]; say $x; @a.push: $f; say $x;

[16:50] <Xliff> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my $x := @a[* - 1]; say $x; @a.push: $f; say $x;

[16:50] <Xliff> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my $x := @a[* - 1]; say $x; @a.push: 'f'; say $x;

[16:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: ¬´e‚ê§e‚ê§¬ª

[16:51] <Xliff> Would have been something if that second value was 'f'

[16:51] <Xliff> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my $x = -> { @a[* - 1] }; say $x; @a.push: 'f'; say $x();

[16:52] <Xliff> m: my @a = <a b c d e>; my $x = -> { @a[* - 1] }; say $x(); @a.push: 'f'; say $x();

[16:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: ¬´e‚ê§f‚ê§¬ª

[16:52] <Xliff> Can do that, though.

[16:53] <uzl[m]> Oh, I see. I'll try to work with that then and see what I can do.

[18:58] <lizmat> and another Perl 6 Weekly hits the Net: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/2019-39-with-a-lump/

[19:02] <guifa> lizmat++ 

[19:02] * guifa got to come home from work today to new weekly and new Comma, it‚Äôs like Christmas 

[19:04] <lizmat> :-)

[19:04] <guifa> And I‚Äôll have to continue the gift giving with an update to Intl::CLDR with a much improved interface for finding numbers in text

[19:05] <guifa> But I was wondering first if I should add a custom action and if so, what best practices might be

[19:06] <guifa> Right now you can do ‚Äúasofijw eoifj sodifjsd fois 2.546394 E     +43 asdoij ‚Äú ~~ /<local-number>/

[19:08] <guifa> and it will pull out the components.  But if I make a method local-number($/), what would folks want the return value to look like?

[19:08] <guifa> Just dump a Rat?

[19:10] <guifa> Or should it be a method that returns a value and some meta data that someone might use inside of the action (and thus need a different name to avoid collision)

[19:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 17d036ad4: OUTPUT: ¬´===SORRY!===‚ê§Cannot find method 'panic' on object of type QAST::MASTRegexCompiler‚ê§¬ª

[19:13] <Doc_Holliwood> Less than awesome.

[19:13] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[19:13] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: indeed, mind creating a rakudo issue?

[19:14] <Doc_Holliwood> Sure, can do

[19:14] <MasterDuke> great, thanks

[19:15] <mojca> What changed in nqp configuration between version 2019.03 and 2019.07.1? I'm trying to update a package which now says "Can't locate NQP/Config.pm in @INC (you may need to install the NQP::Config module)". I see https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2919, but I'm not sure what to make of it.

[19:15] <Doc_Holliwood> it's especially bad since that is a likely typo

[19:15] <Doc_Holliwood> at least on german keyboards where the . is right next to the -

[19:15] <mojca> The error happens immediately after "/opt/local/bin/perl Configure.pl --prefix=/opt/local --prefix=/opt/local --backends=moar"

[19:23] <MasterDuke> mojca: the build system had an almost complete rewrite

[19:23] <mojca> MasterDuke: thank you. But now I'm not sure how deep I should keep digging to solve the issue.

[19:23] *** kylese left
[19:24] <mojca> I'm not even using perl6 myself, I just happened to end up packaging it

[19:24] <MasterDuke> how did you update your source? you might need to do something like `git submodule init` (i'm not sure the exact command)

[19:24] <mojca> I'm fetching the released sources, I'm not using git

[19:24] <mojca> Let me check

[19:25] <MasterDuke> vrurg: ping, ^^^

[19:26] <vrurg> MasterDuke: do you know how do we create the sources archive?

[19:26] <mojca> I believe I'm fetching from https://github.com/perl6/nqp/archive/2019.07.1.tar.gz

[19:26] <MasterDuke> i don't. AlexDaniel or rba might know

[19:26] <mojca> But I also see https://github.com/perl6/nqp/releases/download/2019.07.1/nqp-2019.07.1.tar.gz, so maybe I need to switch

[19:27] <vrurg> mojca: It's not related, not in the sense of your problem.

[19:27] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: tl;dr `make release`

[19:27] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod

[19:28] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also this (based on the release guide) https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/tools/releasable/Sakefile

[19:28] <mojca> Unrelated: what's the point of shipping https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/ports/macports/Portfile?

[19:29] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: thanks.

[19:29] <mojca> almost everything in that folder is wrong

[19:30] *** MilkmanDan left
[19:30] <mojca> ... and nobody is doing it any longer

[19:30] <AlexDaniel> yeeeaa I'm not sure what that is

[19:30] <mojca> I would suggest deleting everything that's inside "macports"

[19:31] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: It's for MacPorts.

[19:31] <mojca> except it's not

[19:31] <mojca> it's so horribly outdated that it's useless

[19:31] *** MilkmanDan joined
[19:31] <mojca> so: are the released files missing something?

[19:32] <vrurg> mojca: yes. But I'll have it fixed today. Not sure about the tarball on the web though.

[19:33] <mojca> vrurg: thank you; is there any chance to publish nqp-2019.07.2?

[19:33] <AlexDaniel> mojca: does that make sense? https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/0b8c8c79b3

[19:33] *** Houl left
[19:34] <mojca> AlexDaniel: yes

[19:34] <vrurg> mojca: I think it is likely.

[19:34] *** pecastro joined
[19:34] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: I think, 2019.07.2 is more a question to you, I think.

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[19:35] *** krychu joined
[19:35] <AlexDaniel> mojca: what are you packaging it for?

[19:35] <mojca> Before the fix happens: is there something I could test in the meantime to see if that actually solves my problem?

[19:35] <mojca> AlexDaniel: macports

[19:36] <vrurg> mojca++++

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> mojca: nice! Any chance you can apply a patch yourself on top of 2019.07.1 ?

[19:36] <mojca> I can, but I'm not sure which one

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> mojca: ok, that vrurg will hopefuly figure out :)

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> as for doing a nqp-2019.07.2 release just for that issue, that's not very likely

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> we'll definitely have the fix in the next release though

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> releasable6: status

[19:37] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Next release in ‚âà18 days and ‚âà23 hours. R6 is down. At least 4 blockers. Unknown changelog format

[19:37] <releasable6> AlexDaniel, Details: https://gist.github.com/9f689d5f7bdc4ddbfd6c058ff7b1f759

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> and I hope that one will actually happpen :)

[19:38] <mojca> If I get a patch, I can add a patch and then I don't need a new release. I thought that files were missing since someone mentioned adding git submodules

[19:40] <vrurg> mojca: may I ask you to open issues for both NQP and Rakudo? 

[19:40] <mojca> What should I open for Rakudo?

[19:42] <vrurg> mojca: It has the same problem. nqp-configure is a git submodule shared by NQP and Rakudo. Neither includes files from it into the source tarball.

[19:44] <mojca> Is this ok? https://github.com/perl6/nqp/issues/581

[19:45] <mojca> rakudo seems hopeless with > 900 issues :)

[19:45] <vrurg> mojca: yes, thank you!

[19:45] <mojca> so it's just a submodule missing in the release?

[19:46] * AlexDaniel afk

[19:46] <vrurg> mojca: right. To be a bore one ‚Äì files from the submodule. ;)

[19:47] <timotimo> yeah, don't use the release downloads that github creates

[19:47] <timotimo> at one point i made an effort to delete them

[19:47] <timotimo> but every time someone does "git push" it re-creates all of them

[19:47] <timotimo> and all of them are missing all the submodules

[19:47] <mojca> Well, when one makes a proper release, one can upload proper files.

[19:48] *** Sgeo joined
[19:48] <mojca> If you look at https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases, you'll see a gazillion of binary files + of course the auto-generated one

[19:49] * vrurg is afk, will implement the fix later today.

[19:50] *** Sgeo__ joined
[19:50] *** Sgeo_ left
[19:50] <mojca> Hmmm ... you just told me that the file doesn't matter, but it in fact does

[19:51] <mojca> After fetching nqp-2019.07.1.tar.gz from https://github.com/perl6/nqp/releases/download/2019.07.1, the build seems to work

[19:51] <mojca> which is what I would have initially expected, but you convinced me to the contrary

[19:53] *** Sgeo left
[19:59] *** finanalyst left
[20:05] <guifa> Is it possible to add a role via a ‚Äúuse‚Äù statement?  right now using ‚Äúuse Foo::Bar; also does FooBarRole‚Äù but I feel like there ought to be an easier way, but I don‚Äôt really think use could do it since it‚Äôs really supposed to just add stuff to the namespace yeah?

[20:06] *** reach_satori_ joined
[20:06] <lizmat> yeah, use could make the role available, not mix it in

[20:06] <lizmat> at least, afaik

[20:08] <guifa> meh, it‚Äôll work for now.  Three lines for automagic localized number parsing isn‚Äôt the worst (one in grammar, two in actions)

[20:43] *** Sgeo joined
[20:45] <AlexDaniel> ah, that's the actual release tarball, yes

[20:45] *** wamba left
[20:46] <AlexDaniel> the other one is a thing generated by github

[20:46] <AlexDaniel> which I can't disable, unfortunately

[20:46] <AlexDaniel> so if you look at the release, there's both a github-generated tarball and the one that we do: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/releases/tag/2019.07.1

[20:46] <AlexDaniel> it's confusing but I don't know how to solve that‚Ä¶

[20:47] <mojca> Yes, one is ok and the other one is not, and you cannot do anything about it.

[20:47] <AlexDaniel> previously we had our own downloads page but that's still not restored

[20:47] <AlexDaniel> rba: ‚Üë maybe we should?

[20:47] <AlexDaniel> I don't know, using github releases is easier and more straightforward, except for that shitty autogenerated tarball stuff

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> I can't even sign these autogenerated tarballs because they're different every time

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> well, not exactly every time, but they change

[20:48] <AlexDaniel> something something tar

[21:02] <rba> AlexDaniel: we can have our downloads page again. 

[21:02] <rba> All past releases are restored. Moritz was able to restore all 

[21:02] <AlexDaniel> I know, they were backed up by multiple people

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> and now all these past releases are also on github

[21:03] <AlexDaniel> I wrote a script that uploaded them all, with the changelog automatically in the description :)

[21:04] <rba> Cool. So what else you need?

[21:04] <AlexDaniel> rba: well, do we want to rely on github releases?

[21:04] <AlexDaniel> or do we want ot have our own download page?

[21:05] <rba> Github is usually already redundant. 

[21:05] <rba> If you like I can copy them back to the webhost too?

[21:06] <rba> I think deploy to github is proven process?

[21:11] <AlexDaniel> rba: it's not exaclty proven, we just did it last time and nobody seems to be complaining

[21:11] <AlexDaniel> we never did that before

[21:18] <jnthn> guifa: I don't think there's any problem with parameter defaults and JIT. It can handle those pretty well - including being able to optimize out the check entirely and use the type of the default in further analysis.

[21:20] <jnthn> guifa: And the hard work on the .dmg wasn't mine - but yeah, the background was my contribution. 10 minutes to draw, 90 minutes to get the tiff such that it was happy with it and showed it correctly. :P

[21:27] <rba> AlexDaniel: what is your wish? An account for an upload directory?

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> rba: you can also add the other one if there's no support for ed25519 on that machine‚Ä¶

[21:49] <rba> AlexDaniel: Will do tomorrow. Good night.

[23:14] <Xliff> Maybe QT in like.... 5 years. LOL!

[23:14] <Xliff> QT is huge

[23:15] <Doc_Holliwood> Isn't that, once you laid the foundation, mostly grunt work?

[23:20] <Xliff> Yeah. Kinda.

[23:20] <Xliff> But not really.

[23:20] <Xliff> See... each bit has its own variation.

[23:20] <Xliff> But I've got it down to a science, now.

[23:20] <Xliff> Sorta.

[23:21] <Xliff> I'm looking at QT now for shiz-and-giggles.

[23:21] <Xliff> 1793 classes! Hahahaha!

[23:25] <Doc_Holliwood> That's it?

[23:25] <Xliff> Um. Yeah. That's it.

[23:26] <Xliff> Sounds like this is up your alley, DH!

[23:27] <Xliff> Comparitively, GTKPlus has about 914 modules. Not all of those map directly to a Class. It's more like 450 classes.

[23:29] <Doc_Holliwood> I meant that in an ironic way ;)

[23:29] <Xliff> I figured. :p
