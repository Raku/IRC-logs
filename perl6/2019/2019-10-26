[05:44] <Hermit> [{a=>1}, {b=>2}, {c=>3}].reduce({ $^a{$^b.keys} = $^b.values })

[05:45] <Hermit> should work?

[05:49] <Hermit> anyone home?

[05:50] <Hermit> another version, better error message:

[05:50] <Hermit> ({a=>1}, {b=>2}, {c=>3}).reduce( sub (Hash $a, Hash $b) { $a{$b.keys} = $b.values })

[05:51] <Hermit> so basically, if you try to .reduce an Array of Hashes, it won't bind the individual Hashes to Hashes -- it tries to bind something to List

[05:53] <Hermit> never mind, figured it out

[05:53] <Hermit> reduce is a weird operator

[11:25] <timotimo> i'm pretty sure the surprise came from $b.values being returned from the first invocation and being passed as $a the next time
