[10:24] <rindolf> is this a networking problem?

[12:58] <Juerd> I have servers.

[12:59] <timotimo> we also have servers

[12:59] <timotimo> http://doc.perl6.wakelift.de

[12:59] <Juerd> So why can't we point doc.perl6.org there?

[13:01] <timotimo> this is my snarky way to say that we can't reach the person who has access to the dns server to change stuff, and we're honestly not even sure if we the person we've been trying to reach even is the right person

[13:01] <timotimo> i don't think they can be changed without convincing the current domain owner/administrator/whatever

[13:01] <timotimo> provider?

[13:02] <Juerd> Damn

[13:02] <Juerd> Meh, the whois info doesn't say who has the domain either

[20:54] <sena_kun> is there a way to change the, uhm. let's say I have a file with a name(not its content) encoded in SHIFT_JIS, but my system is utf8. I want to play with this file name in Perl 6, but it automatically produces me a an IO::Path with a "garbage" name, as it seem to try to get filenames in utf8. Is there a way to say "Get me this file with its name in bytes" or "Get me this file with its name decoded as SHIFT_JIS, not utf8"?

[20:55] <sena_kun> I have a looot of such files, so the ultimate goal is to write a script that will convert all broken names into proper unicode... but firstly I have to do it for a single file.

[20:55] *** isacl___ left
[20:58] *** skids left
[20:58] *** mrsolo left
[20:59] <ugexe> im guessing you need to use NativeCall since maorvm is doing encoding of e.g. input file paths

[21:01] *** kipd left
[21:01] <sena_kun> unfortunately, I have no idea on how to resolve it with C(implying NativeCall)

[21:01] *** BuildTheRobots left
[21:01] <sena_kun> any points to functions I might want?

[21:02] <timotimo> sena_kun: you can get back to the original bytes by decoding the stuff as "utf8-c8"

[21:03] <ugexe> if you want to open such a file I'm guessing you would just call open instead of going through MVM_file_open_fh

[21:03] <sena_kun> timotimo, what can I decode? I can only use `dir[0]` and it gives me an IO::Path with a name like `x94􏿽xED􏿽x8`. And I can't call `decode` on IO::Path or on Str, I don't have a Buf.

[21:04] <sena_kun> I can open it, I want to rename it to result of "get raw bytes of this file's name -> decode as SHIFT_JIS -> encode as UTF-8" operation

[21:13] <timotimo> sena_kun: hold on

[21:13] <sena_kun> yes

[21:13] <sena_kun> timotimo, I am now trying to look at in under Windows, actually

[21:14] <sena_kun> because Windows has SHIFT_JIS support and I wonder if I'll be able to do something with it...

[21:14] <timotimo> you should be able to get the filename out of the IO::Path with the typical methods

[21:14] <timotimo> you can use any Buf for an IO::Path by using .encode("utf8-c8") because moar will decode that to get the right bytes to use with the filesystem layer

[21:15] <timotimo> m: IO::Path.new("\x01\x02\x03".encode("utf8-c8")).say

[21:15] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 90e18b65f: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) Cannot resolve caller new(IO::Path:U: Blob[uint8]:D); none of these signatur…»

[21:16] <sena_kun> timotimo, what if I am getting filenames from `dir` and they are already decoded incorrectly?

[21:16] <timotimo> it's not incorrect

[21:17] <timotimo> just go via utf8-c8 to bytes, then via shift_jis to a string

[21:17] <ugexe> they will just look incorrect right?

[21:17] <timotimo> yes

[21:17] *** lucasb joined
[21:17] <timotimo> when you just print them, you're encoding as utf8, and the string actually has some special-use sequences moarvm invents that are picked up by the utf8-c8 encoder

[21:18] <timotimo> so it'll look funky, but it'll tell you what's in the original, especially if you have mostly utf8, but some b0rked bits in the middle

[21:18] <sena_kun> like `dir[0].path.encode('utf-8').decode('windows-932')`? I am getting `Error decoding shiftjis string: could not decode byte 0xF4`

[21:18] <timotimo> encode it via utf8-c8

[21:19] <sena_kun> Unknown string encoding 'utf-8с'

[21:20] <timotimo> you're not supposed to typo it :D

[21:20] <sena_kun> укьююю

[22:38] <xinming> Anyone here knows is it possible that I remove the use of immediate var %res there?

[22:38] <xinming> Thanks. :-)

[22:38] <xinming> I mean make the logic oneliner.

[22:39] <sena_kun> xinming, what the code do? sorry, too sleepy to read it, but maybe I can write some...

[22:40] <sena_kun> so you have a hash of hashes, every inner has account and amount, and you want to get it in one line, right?

[22:41] <xinming> Yes.

[22:41] <sena_kun> m: my @h = {account => 'a', amount => 50}, {account => 'b', amount => 250};

[22:41] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 7af60cef7: OUTPUT: «»

[22:41] <xinming> I think we can use state var. But I'm not sure what is the best idea to do it.

[22:42] <sena_kun> m: my @h = {account => 'a', amount => 50}, {account => 'b', amount => 250}; say @h.map({ $_<account> => $_<amount> }).Hash;

[22:42] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 7af60cef7: OUTPUT: «{a => 50, b => 250}␤»

[22:42] <sena_kun> like this?

[22:42] <xinming> But the 'account' may duplicate

[22:42] <xinming> my @h = {account => 'a', amount => 50}, {account => 'b', amount => 250}, { account => 'a', amount => 5 };

[22:42] <sena_kun> maybe a Bag?

[22:42] <xinming> the amount will be sumed

[22:43] <xinming> first group by account key, then, sum the list.

[22:43] * sena_kun has a feeling Bag is for such things

[22:43] <xinming> Just wish to know the right way to do things in perl6. :-)

[22:43] <xinming> the code does work, but not elegant

[22:47] <sena_kun> m: my @h = {account => 'a', amount => 50}, {account => 'b', amount => 250}, { account => 'a', amount => 5 }; say @h.classify({ $_<account> }).map({ .key => .value.map(*<amount>).sum });

[22:47] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 7af60cef7: OUTPUT: «(a => 55 b => 250)␤»

[22:48] <sena_kun> m: my @h = {account => 'a', amount => 50}, {account => 'b', amount => 250}, { account => 'a', amount => 5 }; say @h.classify(*<account>).map({ .key => .value.map(*<amount>).sum });

[22:48] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar 7af60cef7: OUTPUT: «(b => 250 a => 55)␤»

[22:49] <sena_kun> is probably my best golf... And still looks so-so.

[22:49] <sena_kun> and just a friendly note that I'd not golf such an easy construct

[22:50] <sena_kun> in this late night I am having trouble reading a "normal" code without a comment on what it does, and after a golf...

[22:55] <xinming> Thanks. :-)

[22:56] <xinming> I'm still thinking about how that worked.

[22:56] <xinming> Good night.
