[13:12] <user3> why doesn't that flatten

[13:13] <evalable6> user3, rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «0␤0␤»

[13:13] <user3> why is "state" ignored?

[13:14] <jnthn> Because state works per closure, and your {...} is a closure, cloned at returned from the sub

[13:14] <user3> ok, so it's not like C static

[13:14] <jnthn> m: sub s { { state $i++ } }; my $s1 = s; say $s1(); say $s1();

[13:14] <evalable6> jnthn, rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) No such method 'CALL-ME' for invocant of type 'Int'␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/biYAZpiPis line 1␤␤»

[13:15] <jnthn> No

[13:15] <jnthn> Ah, though...it's a bare block there so less useful :)

[13:15] <jnthn> m: sub s { return { state $i++ } }; my $s1 = s; say $s1(); say $s1();

[13:15] <evalable6> jnthn, rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «0␤1␤»

[13:15] <jnthn> That's what I wanted to show

[13:15] <jnthn> m: sub s { return { state $i++ } }; my $s1 = s; my $s2 = s; say $s1(); say $s2(); say $s1(); say $s2();

[13:15] <evalable6> jnthn, rakudo-moar 044b33902: OUTPUT: «0␤0␤1␤1␤»

[13:16] <jnthn> That's why you can use `state` in a `for` loop and it's just scoped to that iteration
