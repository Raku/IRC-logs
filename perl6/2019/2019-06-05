[07:52] <jast> possibly related to the person you wanted to reach earlier? I don't know any of the names unfortunately :)

[07:53] <jast> a quick web search supports that hypothesis :)

[08:17] <holyghost> ok, take care

[08:17] <Xliff> I will try to do something, but I can't make any promises. :(

[08:17] <holyghost> ok, is your $dayjob Gtk based ?

[08:17] <holyghost> just interested

[08:17] <Xliff> Um. Yeah (?)

[08:17] <Xliff> I'm trying to work on it so that it is.

[08:18] <holyghost> ok, I need to fix Mathx::Stat and Bayes::Learn myself still, so take your time

[08:18] <Xliff> Are you on a machine that can handle X11? I spun up another VM to demo my GTK projects.

[08:18] <holyghost> The issues from JJ

[08:18] <Xliff> Unfortunately I can't get Clutter to work from there since it relies on OGL and GLX.

[08:18] <Xliff> At least not yet, anyways.

[08:19] <Xliff> Is your last public key good for YOU?

[08:19] <holyghost> yes

[08:19] <holyghost> You're doing OpenGL ?

[08:19] <Xliff> If so, I can set it up so you can take a look.

[08:19] <Xliff> Well. Clutter is based on OpenGL because COGL is.

[08:19] <Xliff> GNOME's latest desktop is Clutter-based

[08:20] <holyghost> I read the OpenGL primer once, if you like I'll return the favor if it's on github for example

[08:20] <holyghost> It's probably not OSS, I guess

[08:21] <Xliff> It's on Githgub

[08:21] *** domidumont left
[08:21] <Xliff> *Github

[08:21] <holyghost> can you give me a link ?

[08:21] <Xliff> I'm spinning up the VM.

[08:21] <holyghost> As long as I can hack ...

[08:22] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/p6-Clutter

[08:22] <Xliff> I don't mind you hacking. Send PRs

[08:22] <Xliff> Heh. I can start EC2 instances from the CLI using Perl6, now. 8-D

[08:23] <holyghost> Looks like serious work

[08:23] <Xliff> Yup

[08:24] <holyghost> I am glad for the GL things, I think vanilla GL is too easy to program in

[08:24] <holyghost> for the GL things in perl6 I mean

[08:24] <holyghost> but I'm not too fond of the procedures in common OpenGL (Mesa for example)

[08:25] <holyghost> The extensions I need to look into TBH

[08:25] *** dakkar joined

[08:46] <woolfy> holyghost : Your discussion is a private one.  If I want to privately discuss things with others, I will go to the private chat options.  And I know, sometimes I can be chatty, but I will stop when other people are bothered.

[08:47] <holyghost> woolfy : we're already doing that :-) 

[08:47] <woolfy> holyghost : Thank you.

[08:48] <Xliff> But that's beside the point.

[08:48] <Xliff> Your point is well taken. 

[08:48] <woolfy> holyghost : That's not a good reason to not do it.

[08:48] <holyghost> woolfy, I know

[08:49] <woolfy> Xliff : your comments are actually interesting to read...

[08:50] <holyghost> anyway, me and Xliff are going to write perl6 games in Cairo, HTH

[08:52] <woolfy> Xliff : Nice, re: Amazon to talk to a cro-based client.  I guess that will lead to a nice blog.  Because that would be good Perl 6 promotion.

[08:53] <woolfy> Question to #perl6 regarding the webserver on which perl6.org was located and that died.  I am missing https://marketing.perl6.org/  and there was a lot of useful stuff on there.

[08:53] *** Manifest0 joined
[08:53] <woolfy> Re https://marketing.perl6.org/  : I hope a backup was available and could at some point be restored.  Some of my stuff was on there...

[08:54] <woolfy> and I could try to gather all of it, but that will be many hours of work, and it would just be my stuff.  While putting a full backup back, would probably be much less time.

[08:55] <woolfy> At the moment, https://marketing.perl6.org/ says "Perl 6 Documentation", which is nice information, but not related to marketing.

[08:55] <holyghost> *

[08:55] <Xliff> Yeah. The XML deserialization needs some work though, hence my need to talk to RabidGravy.

[08:56] <Xliff> I'm having an issue with XML::Class and class reuse.

[08:57] <Xliff> woolfy: You might need to talk to AlexDaniel or timotimo about getting those backups.

[08:57] <woolfy> Xliff : maybe.  But I am placing it here, because they read this as well.  I hope.

[08:57] <rba> woolfy: Moritz was able to recover some stuff from the servers hard drive. I thing there was no backup.

[08:57] *** netrino__ joined
[08:57] <rba> think

[08:57] <holyghost> woolfy, do download tarballs from time to time

[08:58] <woolfy> rba That would make me very sad.  And a bit angry.

[08:58] <woolfy> holyghost ; that is not helpful.

[08:58] <holyghost> why not ?

[08:58] <woolfy> Sorry, I have to go.  Checkout of hotel room in minutes...

[09:00] * rba is understanding woolfys feelings.

[09:00] <holyghost> I would'nt know here

[09:01] <rba> woolfy: we will add backup to further hostings

[09:03] <holyghost> rba, can she backup with a downloadd of a tarball now ?

[09:03] *** lizmat left
[09:03] <holyghost> shell access then tar zcvf etc

[09:04] *** Xliff left
[09:04] <holyghost> Good night, Xliff

[09:05] <rba> holyghost: I think the only way is to ask moritz to search the broken hard drives.

[09:05] <holyghost> rba, I mean in the future 

[09:06] <rba> holyghost: sure, yet I like the files backuped from the hard drives too.

[09:06] <holyghost> indeed

[09:07] <holyghost>       cron/crontab job then download with a shell, TMTOWTDI

[09:07] <rba> As most websites have a github repo as source: Is this the one for marketing.perl6.org? https://github.com/perl6/marketing

[09:10] <timotimo> yeah, the web/ folder has the web app

[09:11] <timotimo> it does have the rakudo.org website readme in it

[09:11] <timotimo> but the app itself is the right one, i'm sure

[13:16] <timotimo> hey tyil, is geth down?

[13:16] <tyil> deployment says it should be up, but I can restart it

[13:16] *** pmurias joined
[13:17] <timotimo> mhh, we're gonna need a watchdog or something

[13:17] <timotimo> ideally figure out how it can disconnect without noticing

[13:17] <tyil> kubernetes should be that watchdog

[13:17] *** Geth joined
[13:17] <tyil> might have been in a netsplit

[13:17] <timotimo> well, kubernetes would have to check irc if geth is present :D

[13:17] <tyil> one could add cro and expose a healthcheck over http

[13:18] <tyil> which could report it's current connection status

[13:18] <tyil> if it fails the healthcheck, k8s will kill it off and respawn it

[13:18] <timotimo> would be possible, yeah

[13:18] <tyil> I see a geth

[13:18] <timotimo> yeah, geth is back \o/

[13:19] <tyil> I still need to figure out why systemd-journald just dies and refuses to start if a server is using a lot of memory (which happens pretty often using perl 6, sadly)

[13:19] <tyil> that's the main cause of nodes dying and taking deployments with them

[13:20] <timotimo> wow, journald dies?

[13:20] <tyil> systemd is a curse in itself

[13:20] <timotimo> could be that it's taking the core dump and that takes very long?

[13:20] <timotimo> that's certainly a thing journald does by (i imagine) default

[13:20] <tyil> idk, I still think any logging (and by extension, init system) that dies this easily and breaks itself is horrible

[13:20] <timotimo> so a core size ulimit could help

[13:20] <tyil> I can set one

[13:21] <tyil> if you think itll be beneficial

[13:21] <timotimo> like, does it actually die? as in, the process disappears?!

[13:21] <tyil> yes, that's the last thing I see in the server's consoles if they die

[13:21] <tyil> a couple OOMKiller messagse saying a Perl 6/moar process was using too much memory and gets killed

[13:22] <tyil> and then journald saying it's failing to start for a couple times

[13:22] <tyil> and then emptiness

[13:22] <tyil> b 28

[13:22] <tyil> I preferably would run with a sane init, but k8s doesn't really play nice with those

[13:24] <timotimo> i wonder if dmesg gives any more interesting output after the oom happens

[13:24] *** netrino__ left
[13:24] <tyil> by the time I notice all my perl stuff dying I can't ssh in anymore

[13:25] <tyil> I could try the web console from the provider next time, and check if that still works

[13:25] <tyil> maybe dmesg has something interesting

[13:25] <tyil> in case of low memory I'd prefer it to just kill a process and respawn it on another node

[13:25] <tyil> not completely kill the node, which causes all deployments to be scheduled to another node, which will then run out of memory, which then dies etc...

[13:26] <tyil> (in all fairness, I'm not a master of kubernetes either, which is why I'm looking for people in here that want to assist me for the perl deployments in my cluster)

[13:38] <timotimo> how do you mean Version can't parse it?

[13:42] <vrurg> Sorry, it can. It was a mistype in my code.

[13:47] <ugexe> version can't parse what?

[13:47] <vrurg> timotimo: anyway, what is the meaning of it? v6.* eq v6?

[13:47] <ugexe> n/m

[13:47] <ugexe> should have read 3 more lines

[13:47] <timotimo> i guess

[13:47] <timotimo> ugexe: is use v6.* equivalent to use v6?

[13:49] <ugexe> v6.* contains v6

[13:49] <ugexe> v6 is equivalent to v6 followed by any number of 0s

[13:49] <timotimo> you don't mean that as in "string-contains", right?

[13:50] <ugexe> v6.* is a range of v6 .. v6.9999999~

[13:50] <ugexe> well, not totally true, v6.a .. v6.999999~

[13:51] <timotimo> v6 comes after that?

[13:51] <ugexe> v6 is v6.0

[13:51] <timotimo> ok

[13:51] <ugexe> v6.a comes before v6.0

[13:51] <timotimo> you said that up there already! sorry

[13:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Perl 6 (6.d)␤»

[13:53] <ugexe> thats not right

[13:53] *** ravenousmoose joined
[13:53] <vrurg> What sense does it make in 'use v6.*;' then? 

[13:54] <ugexe> because its a version, so why wouldnt you be able to do so?

[13:54] *** [Sno] left
[13:54] <ugexe> this is why i said `use Perl:ver<6.*>` syntax would have been better

[13:55] <ugexe> its still an odd thing to do, but it should be more apparent what is going on

[13:55] <ugexe> anyway v6.* should take the highest available version and its not

[13:56] *** moony joined
[13:56] <ugexe> so anyone literally using `use v6.*;` is not going to be getting the behavior they think

[13:57] <timotimo> should it also get a .PREVIEW?

[13:57] <timotimo> in a regular version object sense it should

[13:58] <ugexe> hard to say. ultimately the final .PREVIEW version would `emulates` the actual finalized spec version

[13:58] <ugexe> er i misunderstood

[13:59] <ugexe> you are saying v6.* if choosing the newest version it could be argued it should choose .PREVIEW in some cases

[13:59] <timotimo> aye

[14:00] <timotimo> but .PREVIEW is there to "opt in to features that may change before the final spec version appears"

[14:00] <vrurg> My logic says that .PREVIEW must be explicitly stated.

[14:00] <timotimo> and v6.* isn't really a clear "yeah i want that"

[14:00] <ugexe> yeah no one wants .PREVIEW when they say 6.*, but module loading in general works that way

[14:00] <ugexe> however

[14:01] <ugexe> module loading does not always choose the highest version. it chooses the highest version in the first repository containing any match at all

[14:01] <timotimo> huh, at first glance that sounds kind of odd

[14:01] <ugexe> yes there are pros and cons for it

[14:02] <ugexe> i kind of like the "include results from everything" approach but that isn't the performance path

[14:02] *** [Sno] joined
[14:02] <timotimo> can a repo object implement "include everything" semantics? i'd assume it could

[14:03] *** netrino__ left
[14:03] <ugexe> yes now that .candidates exists

[14:37] <ugexe> why would it coerce? maybe you are doing string comparison

[14:38] <vrurg> It's a Version on rhs, that's why.

[14:39] <ugexe> does anything else magically coerce when using smart match?

[14:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: ( no output )

[14:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[14:40] <vrurg> For example

[14:40] <ugexe> how do you compare 1.a to 1.1

[14:40] <ugexe> you have to choose some semantics

[14:41] <vrurg> Version-wise I'd say they don't match – different versions. If that's what you're asking.

[14:41] <ugexe> right. now how do you sort it

[14:42] <ugexe> version is entirely a sort order mechanism

[14:42] *** netrino__ left

[14:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «False␤»

[14:43] <ugexe> missing the point

[14:43] <ugexe> m: say Version.new("1.a") cmp Version.new("1.1")

[14:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Less␤»

[14:43] *** mtg joined
[14:43] <ugexe> m: say "1.a" cmp "1.1"

[14:43] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «More␤»

[14:44] <ugexe> by coercing you take away the choice

[14:44] <ugexe> both are valid

[14:45] <vrurg> Ok, no problem. The semantics of smarmatch is "rhs accepts lhs". So, Str ~~ Version -> Version ~~ Version; OTOH Version ~~ Str -> Str ~~ Str

[14:46] <ugexe> what if i want to know if it accepts an actual string type and not a version?

[14:47] <ugexe> i would even ask: is there a single instance of ACCEPTS coercing its argument?

[14:48] <vrurg> Any practical use for it? A parameter with any value of any type?

[14:48] *** netrino__ joined
[14:49] <ugexe> m: Version.new("1.a") ~~ Version.new("1..a") # another example

[14:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: ( no output )

[14:49] <vrurg> ugexe: Does this line in Numeric counts? '(try my \numeric = a.Numeric).defined'

[14:50] <ugexe> i dunno, but just seeing that screams its not something to be emulated

[14:51] *** kurahaupo1 joined
[14:51] <vrurg> Ok, it's not really important. I like that "1.2" ~~ 1.2 – it follows DWIM well enough. I would extend this to Str vs Version too. But won't insist. We have bigger problems to take care of. :)

[14:51] <vrurg> Thanks, I must go now.

[14:52] <ugexe> "1.2" ~~ 1.2 is the most simple possible example one could come up with though

[14:52] *** kurahaupo1 left

[14:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[14:53] <ugexe> so we can see Version is not just a string

[14:53] <ugexe> not just a Str rather

[14:55] *** ravenousmoose left
[14:59] <ugexe> looks like Str.ACCEPTS coerces too

[14:59] <ugexe> so the problem is then this

[14:59] <ugexe> m: say Version.new("v1.0")

[14:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «vv.1.0␤»

[14:59] <ugexe> that is not correct

[14:59] <ugexe> so it cant just naively coerce

[15:00] <ugexe> one cannot also assume they can just strip a leading v

[19:15] <antoniogamiz> o/

[19:15] <timotimo> \o

[19:15] <antoniogamiz> someone knows how to specify mi6 to use more than one file to generate the README?

[19:17] *** Manifest0 joined
[19:18] <timotimo> https://modules.perl6.org/dist/App::Mi6:cpan:SKAJI/lib/App/Mi6.pm6#L131 - all i know

[19:18] <timotimo> if you look closely, you'll find that it runs perl6 --doc=Markdown $the-file-you-put-in-the-config

[19:18] <timotimo> and there's a phaser named DOC that runs only when documentation is being generated

[19:19] <antoniogamiz> so... it cannot be done?

[19:20] <timotimo> quite the opposite

[19:20] <timotimo> anything you output in the DOC phaser will go in the file

[19:20] <antoniogamiz> ah then I'm a bit lost here haha

[19:20] <antoniogamiz> what's the DOC phaser? :/

[19:20] <timotimo> m: DOC { say "this only runs when the documentation of this file is being requested" }

[19:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared name:␤    DOC used at line 1␤␤»

[19:21] <timotimo> wait what?

[19:21] <timotimo> m: DOC INIT { say "hi" }

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: ( no output )

[19:21] <timotimo> oh, i didn't realize you have to put it in front of BEGIN, CHECK, or INIT

[19:23] <antoniogamiz> so I have to add a phaser INIT and DOC?

[19:24] <antoniogamiz> but what do I put in the DOC?

[19:24] <antoniogamiz> sorry for not get it

[19:25] <timotimo> it'd be "DOC INIT", "DOC BEGIN" or "DOC CHECK"

[19:28] <antoniogamiz> I've put that but it's not working :/

[19:28] <antoniogamiz> I've opened an issue: https://github.com/skaji/mi6/issues/72

[19:30] <timotimo> what exactly did you put, and what did it do or not do?

[19:31] <antoniogamiz> I added exactly DOC INIT to the beginning of the pm6 file I want to be included in the README

[19:32] <antoniogamiz> and after that I've executed mi6

[19:33] <antoniogamiz> agh I must go, pls tell me what you think and I'll come back later

[19:33] <antoniogamiz> thanks a lot for the help ;)

[19:33] <timotimo> gotta install mi6, hold on

[19:43] <zostay> Anyone know of a way to get DBIish to find homebrew installed /usr/local/lib/libmysqlclient.dylib under macOS Mojave? I've tried symlinking, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, and just about everything else I can think of, but no joy.

[19:43] *** Kaiepi joined
[19:43] <timotimo> i think we don't automatically look at these env vars in NativeCall

[19:44] <timotimo> you can try dtruss to see where it looks, perhaps

[19:44] *** Manifest0 joined
[19:45] *** abraxxa left
[19:45] *** abraxxa joined
[19:49] <zostay> running dtruss on mojave requires arcane knowledge i don't have

[19:49] <zostay> that is, root is not normally permitted to run dtruss or dtrace

[19:51] <timotimo> dtruss isn't the equivalent of strace on linux?

[19:52] <zostay> i think it is, but you can't run it without getting real root access macos is rootless normally

[19:52] <zostay> root is not root

[19:52] <zostay> i try not to do system level debugging on macos if i can avoid it... if it's that involved, i'll just pin up a container and run my code in there :-p

[19:53] <timotimo> can you attach gdb or lldb?

[19:53] <zostay> probably

[19:55] <zostay> but that's like asking if i can fix the starter on my truck... i could eventually find it and probably figure out how to get it off and buy a replacement... but gee whiz, i don't want to fix my truck, just drive it

[19:56] *** eseyman joined
[19:56] <timotimo> we'd probably want to set a breakpoint in MVM_nativecall_load_lib

[19:56] <timotimo> if you're building with libffi, it'll be defined to just be dlopen, if you're building with dyncall it'll be dlLoadLibrary

[21:05] <timotimo> oh hey jaffa4 

[21:05] <timotimo> ~ is an infix operator in regex

[21:05] <jaffa4> is it not?

[21:06] <timotimo> it actually needs three pieces to parse correctly

[21:06] <timotimo> but not having one in front gives that error

[21:06] <timotimo> which seems LTA

[21:07] <jaffa4> LTA?

[21:07] <timotimo> "less than awesome"

[21:08] <timotimo> as in "not good enough for the standards of perl6 error messages"

[21:08] <timotimo> could make a ticket for it if it isn't already there

[21:08] <jaffa4> ok

[21:08] <jaffa4> is there not operator in regex?

[21:08] <jaffa4> like - for classes

[21:10] <timotimo> there's negative lookahead/lookbehind

[21:11] <jaffa4> so coming back to previous message

[21:12] <jaffa4> it is just a misleading error message. The real problem is ~

[21:13] <jaffa4> ok ... I need to go bye
