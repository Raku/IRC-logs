[00:08] <TreyHarris> The killing isn't the issue; the inability to suppress backtrace output and exit 0 rather than with an error code is.

[00:11] <nadim_> there's a ticket already https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2014

[00:13] *** Manifest0 joined
[00:20] <nadim_> and here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2695

[00:23] <TreyHarris> nadim_: Ah, I see (I came back to this window after coding up a version with traps and handlers in every single scope, and then another one without a MAIN, and then a third one with a unit MAIN, wish I had come back earlier to see ;-)

[00:24] <nadim_> :)

[00:25] <nadim_> I tried catching the exceptios and the signal to no end

[00:27] <TreyHarris> Hm, those tickets... they don't give any workarounds and there aren't any responses, so I guess this isn't solvable. Damn; my project was to switch all my Perl 5 text-munging scripts into Perl 6, but all of them that have indefinite output use this same trick

[00:28] <TreyHarris> Guess line-by-line text-munging remains Perl 5's forte, not Perl 6's.

[00:34] *** Manifest0 left

[00:40] <TreyHarris> Too bad; turns out grammars can be pretty useful for this sort of thing

[00:47] *** Manifest0 left
[00:50] <leont> I'm wondering if a little bit of NativeCall can work around this

[00:51] <leont> But it sure is ugly :-/

[00:52] *** Manifest0 joined
[00:54] <TreyHarris> From some quick checks, it seems like every "scripting" language I have on-hand deals with this silently--a SIGPIPE handler is installed that exits gracefully.

[00:55] <TreyHarris> Looks to be an interesting sort of marker of what's a "scripting" language and what's not, actually.

[00:55] *** jeromelanteri joined
[00:56] <leont> That's not because they handle it, but because the default behavior is to kill the process

[00:56] <leont> This is good for command line tools, and bad for networking applications

[00:57] <leont> perl6 has the other default, which is fine, but appears to lack a way to restore the POSIX behavior.

[00:57] <leont> What does "No appropriate parametric role variant available for 'NativeCall::Native'" even mean?

[00:58] <TreyHarris> Are you sure? Golang's behavior is to do the command-line thing if the SIGPIPE is on stdout or stderr, but to throw an exception on any other file descriptor

[00:58] <TreyHarris> That seems right and doesn't seem bad for networking applications

[00:59] <leont> Then it probably ignores the SIGPIPE, and just handles the EPIPE

[00:59] <TreyHarris> I mean, unless you're running as a CGI, which lots of Perl 5 is still doing, but I don't imagine is something you want for new applications

[00:59] <leont> Though I think handling this in a signal handler possible (at least on Linux)

[01:00] <TreyHarris> leont: right. But since at an OS level you install a handler on a signal basis, not a "signal if following conditions are true", they did install a signal handler even when it ended up doing default behavior

[01:06] <leont> Go's behavior sounds like a sensible default, actually.

[01:08] <leont> But I don't think nqp offers enough signalling logic to actually implement it.

[01:11] <ugexe> does libuv? http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/signal.html

[01:17] <leont> Ha!

[01:18] <leont> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/585019

[01:18] <TreyHarris> There's an old an well-known gotcha with that... the most recent write-up I could find of the issue is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52465835/weird-perl-sigpipe-behavior-ignore-works-sub-doesnt

[01:19] <TreyHarris> I think the Camel book, back when it was more Unix-specific, actually said you should only set a SIGPIPE handler to ignore, die, or leave it alone and let Perl and the OS deal with it

[01:19] <leont> (actually, that int64 should probably be a long)

[01:20] <leont> Yeah, I can't think of many cases where handling SIGPIPE is useful

[01:21] <TreyHarris> It's a weird one in that it's catchable but ultimately not really handleable since in most cases you're going to get killed again with SIGPIPE while handling SIGPIPE

[01:22] <leont> Yeah, it's probably dying again when flushing or some such

[01:23] <perryprog> Is there a plan to add (better) support for multi-dimension list comprehensions with inter-list dependencies?

[01:51] <TreyHarris> Anyone have a suggestion for a module to use as a model for POD documenting all your classes, methods, properties and arguments? I'm still getting the hang of it--it's lighter-weight than some languages' doc extraction tools I've used before and heavier than others

[01:52] <TreyHarris> There seems to be some DWIMminess about where you can put POD referring to a particular argument or property, too, and I don't totally understand it (though it seems to work fine)

[01:57] <TreyHarris> Ah, that latter part is explained in the POD doc in perl6/doc. I see now; clever. I'd still like to look at a CPAN module that uses all the inline documentation stuff well

[08:30] <nadim_> Good morning!

[08:31] <jmerelo> nadim_: hey!

[08:31] <nadim_> I have noticed, at many occassions, that running test sometimes fail for nothing. Tests pass when re-running them. this happened when running them in parallel or  not.

[08:32] <jmerelo> nadim_: might be a flapper

[08:32] <nadim_> I noticed that this happens wuite often when I checkout another branch. Anyone else having the problem?

[08:32] <nadim_> a flapper?

[08:32] <jmerelo> nadim_: yep, a test that sometimes fails, sometimes not.

[08:33] <jmerelo> nadim_: but it also depends on how it fails. There are some unsolved problems somewhere that cause errors when there are lots of tests, for instante.

[08:33] <nadim_> not in this case, it happens when code changes are made, after the first fail, they always succeed.

[08:33] <nadim_> here is a message I get: Cannot iterate over a VMNull type object

[08:34] *** Manifest0 joined
[08:34] <nadim_> that looks like something from the guts of P6 not my code

[08:34] <nadim_> I don't even know what a VMNull is :)

[08:36] <nadim_> I'd report this but it is not really reproducible, that's why I ask if other have the same problem

[08:37] <jmerelo> nadim_: then it's the second class. Yep, we have that problem. D#1951

[08:39] *** sjm_uk left
[08:40] <nadim_> Ah! IMHO it could be related to the caching of libraries. I did a very unscientific experiment, when changing branches (when I got many errors) I also removed the lib/.precompiled directory and I didn't get any errors.

[09:34] <skyte> I wrote a simple module , how to publish it on perl6 modules

[09:35] <jmerelo> skyte: I assume you don't have a CPAN identity

[09:35] <jmerelo> skyte: and also that your module is in GitHub. Can we take a look?

[09:36] *** Manifest0 joined
[09:37] *** AlexDaniel joined
[09:37] <skyte> I am a fresh ,  this is my git address https://github.com/skyter10086/Date-Util

[09:38] <jmerelo> skyte: it would benefit from a few more tests... including the methods of the class

[09:38] <jmerelo> skyte: you should test date_cmp and date_diff

[09:39] <skyte> ok , I will check Test docs.

[09:39] <jmerelo> skyte: also, did you check out DateTime? https://docs.perl6.org/type/DateTime

[09:41] <jmerelo> skyte: at any rate, publishing in the ecosystem is just a matter of editing a file in the ecosystem repo and asking for a pull request. Check out instructions here: https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#Upload_your_module_to_p6c

[09:41] <skyte> I 've checked  Date .https://docs.perl6.org/type/Date

[09:41] <jmerelo> skyte: DateTime does have a cmp operation, for instance: https://docs.perl6.org/type/DateTime#sub_infix:%C2%ABcmp%C2%BB and most arithmetic operators.

[09:42] <skyte> All right . I will take a look at that . Thank you!

[09:42] <jmerelo> skyte: you're welcome. Good luck!

[09:42] <sena_kun> before publishing it, it won't hurt to check if DateTime can't do the same in a line or two, and ad more test coverage. but as an exercise, it doesn't look bad. :)

[18:45] <nadim_> comb can be called with -1, 0, 'x' but not Inf, nor NaN, shouldnt it handle them?

[18:51] <tobs> nadim_: what do you imagine it doing for NaN?

[18:58] <ugexe> or Inf for that matter

[18:58] <ugexe> what is the first digit of Inf?

[18:58] <ugexe> oops wrong argument

[19:00] <tobs> Inf would blend in well with the explanation of "Int argument is like /. ** {1..$arg}/", i.e. return everything, like a "sufficiently large number"

[19:03] <nadim_> IMHO, Inf should return the whole string

[19:03] <ugexe> i was thinking you meant Inf.comb, not "...".comb(Inf)

[19:03] <nadim_> as for NaN, what's the differentwith "hello Dolly"?

[19:03] <nadim_> ugexe: ah, no I meant .comb(Inf)

[19:04] <nadim_> lol!

[19:04] <nadim_> I see them in the error message

[19:08] *** natrys left
[19:08] <tobs> I meant: it turns the string into a regex that it combs for. To me that's sensible and expected. I don't know what I would expect for a NaN

[21:01] <AlexDaniel> I've seen some really weird errors that magically go away

[21:04] <guifa> So let’s say you did this

[21:04] <guifa> p6: say "abcabcabc".match(/ab/):g.Str

[21:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 887121991: OUTPUT: «ab ab ab␤»

[21:05] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[21:05] <guifa> That takes the main match object and stringifies. But let’s say I wanted to stringify each of the sub matches

[21:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 887121991: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Missing « or »␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3say "abcabcabc".match(/ab/):g».7⏏5Str␤»

[21:06] <guifa> the hyper operator doesn’t seem to work on account of the adverb.

[21:06] <guifa> (yes I know I can just say .match(/ab/,:g) but this is for code golf ;-) )
