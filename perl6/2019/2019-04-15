[00:05] <Xliff> Huh.

[00:06] <Xliff> MasterDuke: If you want to see the problem in action, you can always check out p6-GtkPlus. ;)

[00:06] <Xliff> It takes a LONG time to compile, but maybe not if you run an example.

[00:07] <Xliff> Checkout latest, and uncomment the block starting here: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/lib/GTK/Dialog/FileChooser.pm6#L113

[00:08] <Xliff> Then run https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/t/0b3-filechooserdialog.t

[00:08] <Xliff> Unfortunately, you will also need: https://github.com/Xliff/p6-Pango.git

[00:08] <Xliff> I need to split this up!

[00:17] <MasterDuke> Xliff: should that test die right away?

[00:17] <Xliff> With that block uncommented? Yes.

[00:18] <Xliff> You should get the circularity message in the console.

[00:18] <MasterDuke> it popped up a dialogue box, i selected a file, clicked exit. it then finished just fine. no circularity message (that block was uncommented)

[00:18] <Xliff> What's your rakudo version?

[00:19] <MasterDuke> This is Rakudo version 2019.03.1-203-g3060d1d0b built on MoarVM version 2019.03-76-gc10fee65c

[00:19] <Xliff> 2019.03.1-202-gad8b5a649

[00:19] <Xliff> Oh lordy. Really?

[00:20] <Xliff> MoarVM version 2019.03-75-g9b1b60f66

[00:20] <Xliff> Huh.

[00:21] <Xliff> MasterDuke: Enough variation to warrant a test. But if it works on your end, I'm not going to sweat too much.

[00:21] <Xliff> I have the fix in place, now.

[00:21] <Xliff> I'll recompile, later. Working on another issue.

[00:22] <MasterDuke> btw, i think there was some discussion that https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0990ecc4b7e2aee383c7acd21013eb63b30b8ee4 might help your problem with modules recompiling more than they should

[00:24] <Xliff> Ooh! Thank you!

[00:25] <MasterDuke> i wouldn't take my word for it though, should check with nine and/or ugexe

[00:26] <Xliff> ugexe gave me some tips a couple of days ago. Seems to work better, but I've started developing via dual-boot rather than a VM.

[00:26] <Xliff> Still am having to recompile a LOT, so maybe I will try the next rakudo pull, soon.

[08:00] <kawaii> jmerelo: looks like there are some blockers, was going to ask AlexDaniel if we're still going ahead with the planned release in 5 days or not (unless they all get magically fixed in that time), the tests with Blin report no regressions though.

[08:01] <jmerelo> kawaii: great :-) AlexDaniel is back to release master? (or whatever the title)

[08:01] <kawaii> jmerelo: no, he's not, but since this the next release is my first I'm taking a lot of guidance from him :)

[13:31] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: the deadline is somewhat arbitrary, although it'd be nice if releases were happening with a slightly stricter timeline, so feel free to fix that. IMO it takes a little bit of “wait why do we still have no release this month” for people to focus on fixing things instead of adding new things :)

[13:35] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: also, I'll be away for this whole week, probably. Especially so on the weekend

[13:35] <AlexDaniel> good luck :)

[13:39] <lizmat> AlexDaniel: hope you're going to have a good time

[13:39] *** sena_kun joined
[13:39] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: also, I think there's no *obligation* to make a release. If it turns out that things are very broken then skipping a release is an option, arguably a much better one than releasing buggy rakudo with some rushy workarounds

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: the dev team is awesome, sometimes you'd see 3-4 blocker resolved per day, so some patience helps also :)

[13:40] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: so what I'm feeling from this discussion is that there probably isn't much point in cutting a release next week unless something urgent comes up that people need?

[13:41] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: not exactly, it's wörk

[13:41] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: also I'm very stressed right now and kinda happy that I won't need to cut a release in the following months…

[13:41] * lizmat wishes AlexDaniel strength

[13:42] <kawaii> lizmat: thank you! As AlexDaniel said it really doesn't look like there are too many major issues, at least things are pretty quiet in here these days and no one is begging for a release like they were for 2019.03 :)

[13:42] <lizmat> kawaii: indeed

[13:43] <kawaii> I'm going to keep running Blin once per week, and file issues relating to regressions

[13:43] <lizmat> but since there's not going to be a Star release depending on this release, I would argue that some blockers may be ignored for the 2019.04 release

[13:43] <AlexDaniel> that's a good point

[13:44] <kawaii> I will wait for more people to complain about a lack of 2019.04 release for now then 

[13:44] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: well, no, what I'm saying that is that there's no point in cutting it in exactly 5 days, but during next week it'd be nice

[13:45] <kawaii> understood

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: keep in mind also that there will be some delays, like blin takes some time to run, it takes some time to review the results, etc.

[13:45] <kawaii> I'll run Blin again on the weekend then

[13:45] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: you'd also be waiting for a moarvm release, which by the way you have to give green light for once things look good :)

[13:50] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: I used to run it about a week before a release, then a day or so before the planned date, then once everything was fixed I'd run it again before making a release. If I noticed something fishy, I'd file some tickets and repeat…

[13:51] <AlexDaniel> if you're not paying for the uptime out of your pocket then you can do it more often

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> it'd be nice to have Blin results like every day or so

[13:52] <kawaii> Nope, it's a server kindly donated by $work, so I can run it 24/7 if we want

[13:52] <AlexDaniel> though I don't know how to arrange that easily

[14:51] <Geth> ¦ ecosystem: review: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/pull/449

[14:52] <kawaii> PS ^ if anyone is creating command-line tools i.e. bots and such, I'd appreciate some feedback on our Command::Despatch module, works nicely for creating commands and subcommands with arguments.

[15:11] <pmurias> kawaii: why is it called Command::Despatch not Command::Dispatch?

[15:12] <kawaii> pmurias: because 'despatch' is the correct spelling in my locale :)

[15:13] <pmurias> what crazy locale is that? ;)

[15:13] <kawaii> pmurias: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/despatch :)

[15:15] * pmurias has too run

[15:15] <pmurias> kawaii: isn't dispatch also the more common spelling in the uk?

[15:16] * pmurias is not from the uk so he just googled it

[15:16] <kawaii> In more recent times, yes, it seems we've got a lot of American spellings becoming more and more common here.

[15:16] *** pmurias left
[15:16] <kawaii> Traditionally though, we used 'despatch'.

[15:22] <sena_kun> kawaii, sure

[15:22] <kawaii> thanks!

[15:22] <sena_kun> kawaii, should I?

[15:22] <sena_kun> give me a second...

[15:22] <kawaii> sena_kun: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/pull/449

[15:22] <kawaii> it failed until I fixed it

[15:22] <kawaii> just needs to be re-checked

[15:23] <sena_kun> kawaii, don't you have enough rights, by the way? You just have to click `Details` right to "continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr — The Travis CI build failed ", and then `Restart build` button(now it is "Cancel build" though).

[15:26] <kawaii> sena_kun: seems that I do now that I logged into travis :)

[15:26] <kawaii> thanks though!

[15:26] <sena_kun> you are welcome
