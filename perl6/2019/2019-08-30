[00:14] <guifa> How would I go about making a trait to modify/override the get/set methods?

[00:18] <timotimo> i'd expect you'd want to at compose time add your own accessor methods

[00:19] *** [particle] joined
[00:20] <guifa> Should I add that to the Variable, or to the Variable.var or the Variable.var.VAR

[00:20] <Xliff> guifa: GTK::Simple has a good example of that.

[00:20] * guifa thought a fantastic way to show off the power of traits would be to let you declare a string as “is localized” and automate all the behind the scenes stuff with gettext/Fluent/etc

[00:20] <timotimo> there should be examples in the ecosystem

[00:20] <Xliff> Actually, those are roles. My bad.

[00:21] <Xliff> guifa: https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple/blob/master/lib/GTK/Simple/PropertyFacade.pm6

[00:21] <timotimo> usually you'll be using the trait to apply a role that then does the work

[00:21] <Xliff> Well... there goes the role.

[00:36] <guifa> Okay, so looks like I “just” need to check it’s applied to a Str and somehow patch in the proxy for the value.

[00:51] <guifa> Xliff: kind of.  This is more or less what the proxy looks like, I’d just need to find some way to bind it with the trait

[00:52] <guifa> https://tio.run/##hY9BCsIwFET3PcVQ6q4Ibly0VASpuFNsdyIlmkgDsZGmUGvJXbyDN9CDxdi6EBFczp/3/8w/sVKMjTk2SKoSnpB7IviFUQQRqETrANYbUFIRRMg5ogncXAri@tg1rJOE8sdNuWHPesoesqzbDValPDfDgtWBFUCQpMt13PZQhGm2GW2h/d6bx@ls0d6vNa/yPrJ9cRqWz6DBhGJ472poRzvOR2GbmHObqUjz8Uf4hdjOf5lCVqDswAtGf7DGPAE

[01:09] <AlexDaniel> is it storing the whole code snippet in that link? :D

[01:09] <Grinnz> yeah that's how that site works

[01:10] <AlexDaniel> interesting!

[01:10] <AlexDaniel> I kinda like that :)

[01:11] <Grinnz> it's neat, but not optimal for irc :P

[01:11] <AlexDaniel> I wonder if using zstd with a predefined dictionary can make it noticeably shorter

[01:15] <Grinnz> mm, or snappy or something

[12:30] <El_Che> tadzik: to give you an idea

[12:30] <tadzik> curious. When I was writing that comment I had a feeling like the rename is a done deal and it won't change anything

[12:30] <tadzik> I guess I overestimated the resistance to some degree :)

[12:30] <El_Che> tadzik: we had someone fresh out of school here. Didn't know much except the superficial languagues you learn at school.

[12:31] <El_Che> tadzik: "you want to do this in Go? I don't know Go, but OK"

[12:31] <El_Che> tadzik: "you want to do this in Ruby? I don't know Ruby, but OK"

[12:31] <El_Che> tadzik: "you want to do this in Perl? Perl? Awful, god no! it's the worse"

[12:32] <El_Che> tadzik: "Do you know Perl? No, but from what I heard it's like COBOL"

[12:32] <El_Che> true story

[12:32] <AlexDaniel> tadzik: from what I understand, not all reviewers hold the opinion that a rename is actually going to improve things. Personally I don't want them to give in just because the majority wants a rename, I want them to truly understand the issue.

[12:32] <tadzik> El_Che: eh, that sucks

[12:33] <tadzik> and it is a marketing problem, and it's funny how that works when you start to actually teach people these things

[12:33] <tadzik> I occasionally teach Python to folks

[12:34] <tadzik> and a lot of them are people who used to do Perl in the past but now they need Python because it's the cool thing and so

[12:34] <tadzik> so I show them all the good stuff, and they like it, and then I show them how it does lexical scoping in closures

[12:34] <tadzik> and they frown and say "you told us this language is good!"

[12:34] <tadzik> and I smile and say "I also told you that I do Perl for a living"

[12:37] <AlexDaniel> but… but… but that's perl5. For perl 6 you also need to explain what it is and how it's different from perl5 and all that

[12:38] <tadzik> right, but that's not what I do there, I just teach Python. If they ask over dinner, then sure

[12:39] <tadzik> but I don't want to digress two much into "let me tell you the whole story about this other language I like" while I'm already timefucked because the client wants to go from zero to writing ansible extensions in 3 days :)

[15:33] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: what about issue text bodies?

[15:33] <jjmerelo> Everyone can check and use now Documentable, the new documentation tool & API https://github.com/perl6/Documentable, just released into the ecosystem by antoniogamiz

[15:34] <jjmerelo> I think that most of the errors have been ironed out, we'll be transitioning into generating and deploying it with this in the next few days

[15:34] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: I'll do that on this weekend... but I tried to make the issues do not need a body... but I'm adding it anyway...

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> cool

[15:34] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: let me know if you need help using the script

[15:34] <jjmerelo> antoniogamiz has done an excellent job; we'd like to incorporate work by noisegul now in the next few weeks.

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: like we check for whitespace and other stuff, let's also check that the output doesn't have bare symbols like < or > or & or @, etc.

[15:40] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: I wonder, would Documentable make it easier?

[15:42] <jjmerelo> As a matter of fact, that web you're pointing to hasn't been updated in days

[15:42] <jjmerelo> I just updated the new one, took all of 20 seconds https://docs-stage.p6c.org/type/Telemetry::Instrument::ThreadPool

[15:43] <jjmerelo> Guest93: thanks a lot. Fixed.

[15:44] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: what Documentable will make sure is that pods are parsed only once. We'll have to make all tools depend on that, including tests

[15:44] <Guest93> jjmerelo: nice!

[15:45] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel so it's not going to make that easier; only faster. 

[15:46] <jjmerelo> Before, we had to run htmlify.p6 to generate documentation, even if only one file had been changed. Now you generate the cache only once, and then you run documentable update to re-generate what's changed.

[15:47] <AlexDaniel> nice nice

[15:47] <jjmerelo> Time for re-generating documentation has gone from 15-20 minutes to a few seconds. Even initial generation is faster, taking around 8 minutes

[15:49] <discord6> <Rogue> Wow, very nice

[15:50] <jjmerelo> documentable is also configurable and you could use it for any module. URL generation as also been decoupled from physical layout in the repo, so that we can move stuff around at our convenience without changing the API

[15:52] <jjmerelo> It's still not perfect (type graphs and highlighted code is not cached, for instance), but I feel it's more solid now; everything is tested and specified, so it's easier to evolve or improve.

[15:52] <jjmerelo> Antonio has really made a great job out of his GSoC project. Is still doing, in fact.

[15:54] <satoriprints> lol perl6

[15:54] <satoriprints> j/k

[15:55] <tbrowder> jjmerelo: hi, any progress yet with adding a new doc?

[15:55] <tellable6> 2019-08-29T06:34:36Z #perl6 <jjmerelo> tbrowder we're still kind of wary to deploy it in the production server. It will arrive eventually.

[15:55] <jjmerelo> tbrowder that's been fixed. It works with update, also, no need to regenerate the cache

[15:56] <jjmerelo> tbrowder Pod::To::Cached gets kind of confused with that, but antoniogamiz has worked around it so that it works now. We tested it this morning with a new file (which is _very_ incomplete)

[15:58] <tbrowder> ok, thnx. i shouldn't have added the new doc before i had worked out the bugs (my bad, sorry), the first couple of time the build process failed.

[15:58] <Kaiepi> m: class Foo { has Int $.foo = 1; method CALL-ME(Int $foo --> ::?CLASS) { self.new: :$foo } }; my Foo $foo .= 1; say $foo

[15:59] <Kaiepi> hm

[15:59] <jjmerelo> tbrowder did it? Well, we fixed that yesterday... But no problem absolutely, the old system is still usable. We'll be eliminating it in the next few days, after documentable has been released into the ecosystem

[15:59] <Kaiepi> in some code i wrote i accidentally wrote `$!users{$userid} .= $user` instead of `$!users{$userid} = $user` and it somehow ended up calling PSBot::User.CALL-ME

[16:00] <timotimo> right, you can $foo.$bar and it'll $bar($foo)

[16:11] <tbrowder> jnthn: i've been admiring the style of your slides in your presentations lately. are you still making them from text source as in your original tooling you put on gitgub?

[16:13] <tbrowder> that was the tooling you used to make your original doc on the nqp course

[16:17] *** jjmerelo left
[16:19] <jnthn> tbrowder: No; that tooling was used for courses, and for shorter presentations I've pretty much always done 'em with PowerPoint :)

[16:25] <tbrowder> thnx

[16:30] <tbrowder> that tooling has been very useful to me (thanks again for that), but my needs are simpler for sure. btw, in recent years a nasty bug crept into the tex part of the tooling and i have a hack for it if you ever need it.

[22:17] <Xliff> The '»' was my insert.

[22:17] <tadzik> where's the class? :)

[22:17] <Xliff> This is an excerpt. ;p

[22:18] <tadzik> and which line does it complain about?

[22:18] <Xliff> The $!tl's below it don't trigger the error.

[22:18] <timotimo> forgot a "method" after "multi"?

[22:18] <tadzik> you mean 23?

[22:18] <tadzik> yeah, it's a multi sub

[22:19] <Xliff> O I C

[22:19] <tadzik> :)

[22:19] <Xliff> You know you've been staring too long at a block of code when you miss that. 

[22:19] <Xliff> Thanks timotimo++, tadzik++

[22:20] <timotimo> Comma shows methods and subs differently in the structure view :)
