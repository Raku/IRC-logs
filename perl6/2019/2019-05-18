[00:05] <sena_kun> maybe the first fix can do?

[00:05] <sena_kun> i.e. <+[\W]-[\s]>

[00:05] <jnthn> Didn't that cause a different issue?

[00:06] <jnthn> Or was that the one we just solved?

[00:06] <jnthn> [<:punct>|<.sigil>] might do it also

[00:06] <sena_kun> well, I think that nibble issue was another one, we solved that, so now we are solving the first, & issue in a way that does not upset spectest

[00:07] <jnthn> Maybe try the first idea then

[00:08] <sena_kun> all three files are passing... trying out the full spec now...

[00:23] <sena_kun> Result: PASS

[17:22] * sena_kun .oO ( time for a new Perl 6 User Survey is coming )

[17:26] <jmerelo> sena_kun: right :-) There was one half-made last year, right?

[17:26] <timotimo> haven't we had two so far?

[17:26] *** zacts left
[17:27] <jmerelo> timotimo: is that so? Either I missed the second one, or I don't remember it. 

[17:27] <timotimo> it's entirely possible i'm hallucinating

[17:28] *** ufobat joined
[17:29] <jmerelo> I have the initial survey in GDocs, plus another survey in August 2018 that wasn't actually run (or has no answers)

[17:33] <sena_kun> I am looking at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19qSBpGWWc9RNruxPWySHkmy3tppaqeqUNGfZpHhdsMs/viewanalytics

[17:33] <sena_kun> and it says "June"

[17:34] <jmerelo> sena_kun: that was the first one.

[17:34] <sena_kun> and I am not aware about any other surveys, so I suspect if jmerelo doesn't know about it, I guess it is as well as non-existent

[17:34] <sena_kun> so we can plan the second one next month

[17:34] <jmerelo> sena_kun: I can share the draft of the second version if you want. Do I have your Google Account?

[17:37] <jmerelo> sena_kun: I don't seem to have it. Please send it to me privately.

[17:37] <jmerelo> Already editing it to say "June 2019"

[17:38] <sena_kun> well, we still have some time until June

[17:40] <timotimo> i'm sure it'll arrive faster than expected

[18:05] <ufobat> I've got a multi method a (with different signatures) and I want to add another version of a where the parameters are `(Positional $a)` for only those positoinal that could `self.b(|$a.values)`. b is a multi method as well

[18:05] <ufobat> how does this work?

[18:06] <moritz> you can use a subsignture in which you duplicate the signature of b

[18:07] <moritz> so if it's method b (Int $x, Str $y)

[18:07] <moritz> you can do  multi method a (Positional $a (Int $, Str $)) { ... }

[18:07] <moritz> or maybe even use @a instead of "Positional $a"

[18:08] *** Altai-man_ joined
[18:10] <ufobat> in this case I need to add as many `multi method a`s as there are `multi method b(..)`s?

[18:11] *** sena_kun left
[18:12] <moritz> erm, you didn't mention that b was a multi :-)

[18:13] <ufobat> ". b is a multi method as well" <- :p

[18:13] <moritz> maybe you can use a where-block and bake something with cando

[18:13] <moritz> https://docs.perl6.org/routine/cando

[18:13] *** espadrine joined
[18:18] <ufobat>  multi method a(Positional $a where { self.b.cando(|$a.values) }) { } # that's probably wrong, it doesnt work

[18:18] *** zacts joined
[18:21] <ufobat> first, i think, I can't do self.b i need something like self.^lookup('b'), but lookup wont work, that only gives the first matching method

[18:23] <moritz> .^find_method maybe?

[18:24] <moritz> where { self.^find_method('b').cando(self, |@$a) }

[18:24] <moritz> maybe

[18:25] <ufobat> in a(Positional $a )say self.^lookup('b').signature ~~ \|$a.values; <<- this returns always False :(

[18:27] <ufobat> meh

[18:27] <moritz> you're skipping the invocant

[18:28] <ufobat> the self

[18:28] <ufobat> ?

[18:28] <moritz> yes

[18:28] <ufobat> in perl5 it would the first parameter, but in perl6?

[18:28] <moritz> same

[18:28] <ufobat> \(self, |$a.values) ?

[18:29] <moritz> yes

[18:29] <ufobat> still always false

[18:30] <ufobat> https://repl.it/repls/YellowishRemarkableLevels <- this is the code in a repl browser

[18:31] <moritz> isn't it the wrong way round? Capture ~~ Signature?

[18:32] * moritz a bit rusty

[18:33] <ufobat> if i change the order its always true ;-)

[18:51] <masak> looks right-way to me

[18:52] <masak> given that a Capture contains arguments and a Signature contains parameters, and we want to match arguments against parameters

[18:53] <moritz> in the case of regexes, we do Str ~~ Regex, so Data ~~ Pattern

[18:54] <moritz> by that token, I'd expect Capture ~~ Signature

[18:55] <moritz> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#method_ACCEPTS

[18:55] <moritz> the docs agree with me :D

[19:06] <ufobat> when i look at the signature that i see when i print it out: :(::T : |), it looks as if thats just the proto

[19:06] *** jmerelo left
[19:07] <ufobat> since b is a multi how could .signature reflect on that multi signature thingy?

[19:07] <timotimo> there's a signature on the proto and one signature per candidate

[19:07] <moritz> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Signature#method_ACCEPTS

[19:07] <moritz> sorry

[19:08] <moritz> the auto-generated proto always matches everything

[19:08] <moritz> but cando might help

[19:09] <ufobat> ah

[19:10] <ufobat> now it works!

[19:10] <moritz> \o/

[19:11] <ufobat>     multi method a(Positional $a ) {  say so self.^lookup('b').cando( \(self, |$a.values))    }

[19:12] *** ufobat left
[19:13] *** ufobat joined
[19:13] <ufobat> and it works in a where block as well

[19:15] <ufobat> but i guess it wont work in a subset since self might be not available there
