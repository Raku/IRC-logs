[03:19] <happyhans> I'm a linux noob -__-  

[03:20] <irced> happyhans: well are you using sudo then ?

[03:24] <happyhans> oo running `sudo apt upgrade` fixed it for me... thx irced

[03:24] <timotimo> https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg - maybe this is easier to get working

[03:24] <timotimo> oh, ok

[03:24] <irced> happyhans: good luck tho 16.04 might only provide an old rakudo, which might not work as you expect

[03:24] <irced> happyhans: anyway, hth

[03:27] <timotimo> your "perl6 --version" should be from this year, or near the end of last year

[03:27] <timotimo> otherwise things like zef, the module installer, are likely not going to work right

[03:28] <timotimo> unless of course ubuntu 16.04 ships an appropriate older version of zef

[05:12] <Atomic_gToDY> Hi,what's the main difference between php and perl6?

[05:13] <Elronnd> Programmers Hate PHP

[05:13] * irced raises his hand to high five Elronnd.

[05:13] <Elronnd> but PERl is Loved by (6)9% of programmers

[05:13] * irced for his wit.

[05:14] <jaldhar> Hello.  How would I translate this perl5 regex to perl6:  / (.+?) \K (?!\g{1}) /\n/gx

[05:15] <irced> Atomic_gToDY, well perl6 is like a language to write languages, php i believe is pretty fixed. other than that, i think the module ecosystem differences may be relevant.

[05:16] <jaldhar> sorry s/ (.+?) \K (?!\g{1}) /\n/gx

[05:16] <irced> jaldhar: as opposed to inlining perl5?

[05:16] <jaldhar> irced: that's cheating :-)

[05:17] <jaldhar> I came up with /<( .+? )>  <!before $<m> > /

[05:17] <irced> Atomic_gToDY: i dunno if i helped with my answer. i don't know PHP from Adam.

[05:18] <jaldhar> but that just gives me one letter per line instead of all same letters which is what I want.

[05:18] <irced> Atomic_gToDY: imho perl6 is a programmer's universal tool to make tools whereas php is about the premade tools and working directly with those ? :-p

[05:19] <Elronnd> Atomic_gToDY: the main difference is that php uses $ for all variables, whereas p6 uses it only for scalars; @ is for arrays/lists/other vectory things, and a symbol that's not a hash is for hashes

[05:19] <Elronnd> (but that's ok, the # is for smoking)

[05:19] <irced> well first of all, let's ignore the s/ and also the global matching at the end would come as an adverb...

[05:19] <jaldhar> yep

[05:19] <Elronnd> aside from that, they're pretty much the same

[05:19] <irced> says the guy who smokes #

[05:20] <irced> just adding that

[05:20] <irced> jaldhar: well, i am digging into perl6 regexes and just know the basics of perl5 but maybe i can help. looking up some perl5 stuff

[05:22] <jaldhar> irced: basically given a string like ABBCDEEF it should split into A BB C D EE F.  (I'm choosing to display one set perl line hence the \n in my substitution)

[05:22] <irced> jaldhar: ah thanks for specifying the goal

[05:24] <jaldhar> In perl5 I get all consecutive letters which are the same lookahead to see if there are letters which are not the same and if so replace them with a \n.  Then repeat until all letter groups are matched.

[05:25] <jaldhar> In perl6 for some reason I'm only getting one letter per set and I don't understand why.

[05:25] <irced> jaldhar: ok, maybe i can work with your current pattern... ...

[05:27] <irced> jaldar: would you consider using grammars instead?

[05:27] <irced> jaldar: or are you trying to win a competition for least amount of characters in code?

[05:28] <irced> jaldhar: anyone, have camelia show us your output thus far

[05:28] <irced> jadlhar: anyway

[05:28] * irced can't type suddenly

[05:28] * irced looks at the clock

[05:29] <jaldhar> irced: I considered grammars but if I can do it as a one-liner in perl5, I can surely do it as one in perl6

[05:29] <irced> jaldhar: ok, can you have camelia show us your subst call?

[05:31] <jaldhar> hmm that didn't work.

[05:33] <jaldhar> am I doing this right?  I just msg camelia with the code right?

[05:33] <jaldhar> oops forgot the p6

[05:33] <irced> m: say "Hello jaldhar, I am happy to assist."

[05:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «Hello jaldhar, I am happy to assist.␤»

[05:34] <Atomic_gToDY> OK.I know that php runs faster  thanks to FB's effort, and Swoole is often mentioned on v2ex, so I am kind of interested just now. But many critics said that php programmers usually code in chaos and bring problems to java coders.And a bit of php coders haven't been trained in colleges so they know not enough common theory of IT.

[05:35] <jaldhar> sheesh

[05:37] <jaldhar> irced: did you see any of that?

[05:37] <irced> m: print "nope"

[05:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «nope»

[05:37] <jaldhar> m: $_ = "ABBCDEEF";  s:g/  <?after (.+?) > <!before $0 > / \n /; .say;

[05:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «A ␤ B ␤ B ␤ C ␤ D ␤ E ␤ E ␤ F ␤ ␤»

[05:38] <jaldhar> that's it I think

[05:42] <irced> yep

[05:42] <jaldhar> Atomic_gToDY: the main implementation of Perl6 called Rakudo is somewhat slow at the moment though incrementally getting faster with each new release IMO.  

[05:42] *** Atomic_gToDY left
[05:44] *** Atomic_gToDY joined
[05:51] <Elronnd> (but it will never be really fast.  It's just impossible, it's too dynamic.  It's still already plenty fast for most applications, though)

[05:56] <jaldhar> Elronnd: I think there is a lot of room for optimization.  Look at perl5.  That's very dynamic but its been tuned carefully for many years and it is blazing fast at many tasks.

[06:03] <irced> so i still don't have a solution but i haven't given up 😃

[06:04] <Elronnd> jaldhar: true.  I still don't think it'll happen but...we'll see

[06:05] <jaldhar> irced: thanks for trying

[06:11] *** happyhans left
[06:20] <jaldhar> bah I'm going to sleep and this regex will magically fix itself in the morning.

[06:20] <irced> possibly!

[06:20] <jaldhar> goodnight all

[06:20] <irced> thanks for bringing it here anyhow

[06:20] <irced> good luck

[06:21] <jaldhar> irced: and thank you once again for taking the time to help

[08:45] <El_Che> if you don't want to use zef to download the modules in star, there will be propably RC candidates soonish

[08:45] <El_Che> why?

[08:46] <antoniogamiz> because Perl6::TypeGraph is in the ecosystem and in the old versionof perl6/doc that Rakudo Star has

[08:46] <El_Che> dor the users or do you buildnon top of star?

[08:46] <antoniogamiz> so there's a conflict

[08:47] <El_Che> I see. 

[08:48] <antoniogamiz> there's some users who cannot install Perl6::Documentable

[11:39] <antoniogamiz> Doc_Holliwood: you are using named parameters

[12:58] <timotimo> when nil gets assigned to a variable, that variable gets reset to its default value

[13:05] <chloekek> I'm not quite sure I understand how run(..., :out) works with respect to exit code.

[13:09] *** imcsk8 left
[13:09] <chloekek> How come this does not print «-1␤hi␤␤»? exitcode should return -1 if the process hasn't exited yet, which means that this code does wait for the program to exit, somehow.

[13:14] *** veesh joined
[13:14] *** imcsk8 joined
[13:14] <chloekek> Ah, Proc.exitcode waits for the process to terminate: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/15e0601078f35fe88cc1fda51972e31ed0dcdc5a/src/core/Proc.pm6#L219

[16:26] <chloekek> With the --transform option to tar, it seems to work. Let's try another upload.

[16:27] <timotimo> i believe mi6 literally creates a folder with the "right" name and tars that up

[16:28] <chloekek> I'll check out mi6, seems it has dependencies so I need to deal with that first.

[16:29] <chloekek> Yes, now it seems to not fail. It created a .meta file too.

[19:48] <lembark> Q: If I want the docs for a module accessible via "p6doc" the only place to put them is in the module itself, or is there some set of steps that I'm missing for being able to utilize the ./doc directory contents from the module?

[19:58] <Doc_Holliwood> i think you can create a "pod" directory with the same structure as the lib drectory but .pod6 files 

[19:58] <Doc_Holliwood> i have a vague memory having read something like that somewhere

[20:29] <masak> not so surprising, really. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/rak%D1%8A is the original root.

[20:30] <masak> we have that meaning "shrimp" in Swedish. the original meaning is just "crayfish".

[20:30] <masak> and given the etymology of "cancer" and its connection to crabs...

[20:31] <masak> I'm guessing whenever the association in the Slavic languages isn't "cancer", it's simply "crab"

[20:31] <masak> or "crayfish"

[20:41] <cpan-p6> New module released to CPAN! FileSystem::Parent (0.3.6) by 03LEMBARK

[20:42] <lembark> Say that "./pod" (vs. ./doc) is the correct place to leave pod6 files for a given module. How should they be referened from META6.json in the resources section? Or does the pod need to be referenced from the META6.json? Or is thare a tag for doc/pod/whatever that isn't described in https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#index-entry-META6.json-META6.json? Or is it in the ondline docs, if so where?

[20:42] <lembark> Thanks.

[22:37] <uzl> .tell lembark The modules I've come across in modules.perl6.org use "./doc" for their documentation. I don't think the pod files need to be referenced in META6.json. You just need to follow the file structure from "lib/". Thus if you have "lib/Mod.pm6, lib/Mod/Utilities.pm6" and you want only p6doc-accessible documentation for "lib/Mod.pod6", then you end up with "/doc/Mod.pod6".

[22:38] *** jaldhar joined
[22:38] <uzl> .tell lembark For an example: https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Terminal::Table:cpan:ALOREN

[22:39] <uzl> Is the bot not working 😅?

[22:40] *** jaldhar left
[22:41] *** jaldhar joined
[22:41] <timotimo> do we have the new bot active already?

[22:41] <vrurg> uzl: yoleaux was taken down a while ago.

[22:41] <vrurg> timotimo: I guess it's not yet.

[22:42] <vrurg> timotimo: BTW, can I debug rakudo with Comma?

[22:42] *** jaldhar left
[22:42] * vrurg have somehow got it working eventually... ;)

[22:43] *** jaldhar joined
[22:44] <timotimo> well, it lets you debug your scripts, and you can step around inside of rakudo's core setting and such, but i think it cannot yet pull up the "right" source code for you out of a rakudo checkout

[22:45] <vrurg> Argh... Yes, I was stepping in, but without the source it's useless. 

[22:45] <timotimo> right. sorry about that! :(

[22:46] *** jaldhar left
[22:46] <vrurg> No worries. I rather wonder where people get time to do all this work.

[22:46] *** jaldhar joined
[22:46] <timotimo> people paying for comma makes it possible :)

[22:46] *** netrino left
[22:46] <uzl> Ah... Hopefully they read the backlogs.

[22:47] *** netrino joined
[22:47] <vrurg> timotimo: I will soon join the club. Perhaps the next release. Currently I don't have work for it yet as rakudo core is where I need it most.

[22:48] <timotimo> right, then you'll probably also want support for not marking every nqp op as "routine not found"

[22:50] <vrurg> Didn't know about this problem, but most likely I will. ;)

[22:51] <timotimo> you're not nqp-in-ecosystem-modules-using scum like me

[22:53] <vrurg> timotimo: I'm not a Comma user yet, in first place. Just trying it once in a while.

[22:54] <timotimo> ah

[22:54] <timotimo> well, the Log::Timeline viewer is super nice

[22:54] <vrurg> This time I have managed to get around a problem of not being able to open a new project from File menu. Had to turn off project autoopening to do it from the start screen.

[22:55] <timotimo> ah, i think you can also get the start screen from File -> Close Project

[22:55] <timotimo> but maybe that doesn't help there

[22:55] <vrurg> Read about it, haven't tried yet. Though, the project I was doing locally turned out to be useless. So, I'm free for core development for a while. 

[22:56] <vrurg> timotimo: It wasn't closing too.

[22:56] <timotimo> damn

[22:56] <vrurg> Re-checkd again. It doesn't.

[22:57] <vrurg> But considering how fast it starts for me, quit/start isn't a big deal.

[22:57] <vrurg> I also got a freeze one while tested debugging, but unreproducible one.

[22:57] <timotimo> oof

[23:03] <timotimo> ugh wtf why is this bug now coming back

[23:09] <vrurg> Whatever. I set up my domain watcher for camelia.org which is being squattered now. It expires on Aug 24. If I'm lucky, I will re-capture it.

[23:13] <timotimo> pssst this is being publically logged
