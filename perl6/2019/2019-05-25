[06:43] <nadim_> morning!

[06:44] <nadim_> I guess that there is a more concise way to write: defined $_ ?? $_.join !! ''

[06:48] <jmerelo> nadim_: can't think of any.

[06:49] <nadim_> the Any in String context is exactly what I am getting away from

[06:49] <nadim_> jmerelo: thanks for the try :)

[06:49] <jmerelo> m: my $a is default =''; say $a // $a.join

[06:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «␤»

[06:50] <nadim_> but I was thinking about in the lines $_.¿join // ''   where ¿ whorks like ? except that it would check if the variable is defined rather than the method exists

[06:51] <jmerelo> nadim_: there's such thing as overestimating the capabilities of perl6

[06:51] <nadim_> hahaha, wishful thinking

[06:51] <jmerelo> .? is not an operator, it's syntax if I understand it correctly. 

[06:53] <jmerelo> of course you might declare an infix .¿ with Str on the left and a method on the right. That's going to be tricky, anyway. Even more so taking into account the definedness requisite

[06:53] *** jmerelo left
[06:53] <nadim_> can one create an operator that has a method name as one of the operands?

[06:53] <nadim_> you answered before I asked

[06:54] *** chakli joined
[06:55] <chakli> Is there any way to iterate a list from the end? without reversing it completely?

[06:59] <nadim_> what if it is lazy?

[07:00] <nadim_> the problem also exists when reversing it though

[07:42] <nadim_> chakli: it's a list, you can get the number of elements and work from the last one to the first, you'll have to write the code, maybe passing it a code block to apply

[07:43] <lizmat> list.reverse ?

[07:43] <lizmat> list.reverse.map  ?

[07:58] <timotimo> chakli: if you're allowed to modify the list, you can just .pop() until it's empty

[07:58] <timotimo> chakli: but .reverse works with iterators, so it doesn't create a whole new list; instead, it just gives the entries in the reverse order

[07:59] <moritz> you can also iterate over @list.keys.reverse and then use the indexes

[18:05] <simpleUser> hello i'am testing Perl6 for a moment on windows 7 i still can't use modules, when i try to write one for test it's not found

[18:06] <timotimo> hi simpleUser, where is the module relative to your code, and where do you run the code from? like, on the commandline, or do you have an IDE or something?

[18:08] <simpleUser> i have created a text file with extension .pl which runs the script and another one with extension .pm or pm6 located in rakudo/share/perl6

[18:09] <timotimo> ah, that folder is a repository that has a very specific format. if you want a module to appear there, you'll have to use a module installer. however:

[18:09] <timotimo> you can put the module file under a folder named "lib" and either call your script with "perl6 -I lib blahscript.pl" or put a "use lib 'the/path/where/the/lib/folder/lives';" near the start of the script

[18:10] *** vrurg joined
[18:10] <simpleUser> ok thanks i'm trying it right now

[18:11] *** xi- left
[18:11] <timotimo> good luck! i'll probably be AFK soon, not sure for how long, but others in here can surely help you, too

[18:11] <simpleUser> thank you very much i continue testing this

[18:21] <simpleUser> hello i've tried several methods to call the module but it says use v or v6.c but doesn't load the file

[18:23] <timotimo> ok, i'm still here for a moment

[18:23] <simpleUser> cool thanks

[18:23] <timotimo> if you use "use lib 'blah/';" in your script (and the module lives in that blah/ folder) the blah folder has to be relative to your CWD, which you can output like this:

[18:23] <timotimo> m: say $*CWD

[18:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «"/home/camelia".IO␤»

[18:24] *** Manifest0 joined
[18:25] <simpleUser> ok i'm trying this

[18:28] <simpleUser> it says use prefixe for pragma use v or v6.c

[18:28] <timotimo> i'm not sure i understand what error that is

[18:29] <timotimo> are you sure you're running it with perl6 rather than perl?

[18:29] <timotimo> m: v6.c; say "test"

[18:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «test␤»

[18:29] <timotimo> m: use v6.c; say "test"

[18:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «test␤»

[18:30] <simpleUser> i'm running Perl 6.d 2019.03.1 built on moarvm 2019.03

[18:31] <simpleUser> maybe i've missed something in the making of the files

[18:32] <timotimo> perhaps

[18:32] <timotimo> the error message doesn't seem familiar, perhaps it's just a typo

[18:33] <simpleUser> yes i'm going to simplify it from start it's just a hello world test for the moment

[18:34] <simpleUser> trying to do this https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/day-12-modules-and-exporting/

[18:35] <timotimo> OK, what does your "use" statement for v6 or v6.c look like, and how's the one for your module?

[18:35] <lizmat> simpleUser: that's really outdated information, perhaps better to look at https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#index-entry-sub_EXPORT

[18:36] <simpleUser> ok i'm looking at it to correct my two files...

[18:37] <timotimo> BBL

[18:45] <simpleUser> i think i have found the way to use module because now it says i made a mistake into it thanks very much for your help :-)

[20:04] <Xliff> This is on the VM. On the Linux side, I got around this by switching to moar-blead when using rakudobrew

[20:04] <Xliff> It looks like there's an upgrade path missing.

[20:09] *** ufobat__ joined
[20:11] <simpleUser> yes that's it i tried it this afternoon with no effect even if i copied every files in every locations. now that i'm testing files giving the exact path it finds it but i still dont understand mechanic

[20:12] <simpleUser> even if i copy the exemples of https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#use it says undeclared routine

[20:13] *** antoniogamiz left
[20:13] <Xliff> simpleUser: I think I'm running into your conversation. Are you talking about the compile error I just pasted?

[20:13] <Xliff> Or something else?

[20:13] *** ufobat_ left
[20:13] <simpleUser> i'm trying to run modules on windows do you do the same ?

[20:14] <Xliff> No. I run all of my Perl6 projects in Linux. Sorry.

[20:15] <Xliff> Do you have a gist or pastebin of your problem?

[20:16] <simpleUser> i copy paste the exemple of this page https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#use

[20:16] <simpleUser> unit module MyModule;   my package EXPORT::DEFAULT {    for <zero one two three four>.kv -> $number, $name {       for <sqrt log> -> $func {          OUR::{'&' ~ $func ~ '-of-' ~ $name } := sub { $number."$func"() };       }    } }

[20:16] <simpleUser> use "c:/users/name/desktop/ici/MyModule"; say sqrt-of-four;  say log-of-zero; 

[20:17] <simpleUser> is says undeclared routine

[20:17] <Xliff> Did you save the block that starts with "unit module MyModule" into a file called MyModule.pm6 in the current directory?

[20:17] <timotimo> any particular reason you're using a more complicated mechanism to get the subs in there?

[20:18] <Xliff> timotimo: He's working from the docs.

[20:18] <Xliff> https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules#use

[20:18] *** xinming_ joined
[20:18] <timotimo> if the line with 'use "c:/users/..."' is literally like that, i don't think it'll work with a full path like that?

[20:19] <simpleUser> yes i have two separate files. yes first of all i was trying to install GTK::Simple to make GUI on windows but it wasn't finding it

[20:19] <Xliff> Oh! No. That use statement will not work.

[20:19] <simpleUser> it has been found it just says undeclared routine now

[20:20] <timotimo> there is a way to load a module with a full path, but i forgot how to do it

[20:20] <timotimo> ah, yeah, if it complains about the routine missing, it'll be a different problem

[20:20] <timotimo> let me try that code locally

[20:20] <Xliff> Why not just save it as MyModule in the current directory and just use -I.?

[20:20] <simpleUser> yes i was sweating all the day lol

[20:21] <timotimo> also, that path ends just in "MyModule"? like, without a ".pm6" or so?

[20:21] <simpleUser> yes without .pm6 just the name

[20:21] *** xinming left
[20:22] <timotimo> huh. it works on my machine

[20:22] <timotimo> gives 2 and -Inf

[20:22] <timotimo> oh, but i "use"d the module differently, with perl6 -I . and "use MyModule"

[20:23] <simpleUser> so it works on Linux but something is missing on windows 7

[20:23] <timotimo> oh

[20:23] <timotimo> that's how you get the error use used at line 1 (in Perl 6 please use "v" prefix for pragma (e.g., "use v6;", "use v6.c;") instead)

[20:23] <timotimo> the important bit is the "Undeclared routines:" heading before it

[20:23] <timotimo> you use the "use" as if it were a subroutine

[20:23] <timotimo> so it thinks you used it with a value, like "use 6" for example

[20:23] <simpleUser> yes that's the problem because the path is good now

[20:24] <timotimo> in this case it's a string, though. not a number

[20:24] <timotimo> it still says "log-of-zero used" and "sqrt-of-four used" there, too?

[20:24] <timotimo> anyway, that error message really needs improved

[20:25] <simpleUser> yes do you think i must change something ?

[20:26] <timotimo> yeah, i'm not sure how you got it to stop complaining about the "use" part

[20:26] <timotimo> but there's still something wrong with it

[20:27] <timotimo> m: use("this doesn't exist and i have no clue what's going on"); say "test"

[20:27] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Undeclared routine:␤    use used at line 1 (in Perl 6 please use "v" prefix for pragma (e.g., "use v6;", "use v6.c;") instead)␤␤»

[20:27] <simpleUser> yes you are right my mistake, i changed files so many times sorry

[20:28] <timotimo> no problem

[20:28] <timotimo> i can understand it to be super frustrating

[20:28] <timotimo> can you try it with this:

[20:28] <timotimo> use lib "c:/users/name/desktop/ici/"; use MyModule; say sqrt-of-two;

[20:28] <simpleUser> well i give up for the moment, just a question do you have a way to make GUI on Linux ?

[20:28] <timotimo> yeah, GTK::Simple can also be used on linux to make GUIs

[20:29] <timotimo> there's also an "electron" module that allows you to build your GUI by using an embedded browser

[20:29] <timotimo> like the atom and visual studio code editors for example

[20:29] <simpleUser> yes it stopped complaining with use lib

[20:29] *** Xliff left
[20:30] <simpleUser> nice that it works on Linux, too bad they havent made it to windows it must quit time consuming

[20:31] <timotimo> GTK::Simple also works on windows, though

[20:31] <timotimo> not sure what problem exactly you're encountering

[20:31] <timotimo> oh

[20:31] <timotimo> oh, i think i know what's going wrong

[20:31] <timotimo> it's trying to download the windows DLLs from gtk-dlls.p6c.org or something like that

[20:32] <timotimo> that's the server that turned to dust a month ago

[20:32] <timotimo> i totally forgot about that site and didn't restore it yet

[20:32] <simpleUser> well i made a zef install this afternoon

[20:32] <timotimo> ... also i don't know if we have a backup of the files?

[20:32] <simpleUser> and it has not worked even with force install

[20:32] <simpleUser> so  i tried to find where to put files

[20:33] <simpleUser> then i tried testing a simple module

[20:34] <timotimo> yeah, it wouldn't be able to install without that website :(

[20:35] <simpleUser> yes it made me quite angry LOL but no problemo it's nice to test things my level is very low yet but Perl6 is amazing

[20:36] <timotimo> https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php - this is how easy it is to get DLLs for gtk

[20:36] <timotimo> in other words: not

[20:37] <timotimo> oh wow vcpkg what's this

[20:37] <simpleUser> yes i had tested even that method a few times ago, i pulled my hair off my head and it didn't work

[20:38] <timotimo> vcpkg or the gtk.org thing?

[20:38] <simpleUser> i'm curious to see that on Linux i must reinstall a  HDD one day

[20:40] <timotimo> OK, so it's not possible to use the "linux on windows" thing

[20:42] <timotimo> you know what, why don't we use appveyor free windows virtual machine continuous integration service to build GTK DLLs automatically

[20:43] <Xliff> timotimo: Quick look, pls? https://github.com/timo/cairo-p6/pull/26

[20:44] <simpleUser> nice idea i didn't know this one

[20:44] <timotimo> Xliff: if it compiles, feel free to merge it

[20:45] <Xliff> It compiles.

[20:45] <timotimo> wanna help me set up building GTK DLLs on appveyor for GTK::Simple (and of course possibly also your GTK modules)

[20:45] <Xliff> Humm... what would that involve?

[20:46] <timotimo> i think with vcpkg it's actually only three lines to compile everything and then copying and zipping stuff?

[20:46] <Xliff> Sure. Please note my experience with appveyor is Nil. 

[20:46] <timotimo> no prob

[20:46] <Xliff> But if you want help, I'm here!

[20:46] <timotimo> i'm having a hard time focusing today, but maybe all i need is one little push

[20:47] <timotimo> git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg

[20:47] <timotimo> cd vcpkg

[20:47] <Xliff> HA! I know that feeling.

[20:47] <timotimo> .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat You can then install the GTK packages with

[20:47] <timotimo> vcpkg install gtk:x64-windows

[20:47] <Xliff> This on windows?

[20:47] <timotimo> yes

[20:47] <Xliff> Wow! You're in luck! I'm on the Windows side, today. ;)

[20:47] <Xliff> One sec.

[20:49] <timotimo> it looks like appveyor images already come with vcpkg installed

[20:49] <timotimo> so you can ignore the first three lines

[20:51] <Xliff> I'm already running the gtk:x64-windows line

[21:52] <timotimo> oh, did you look at Dear ImGui again since we last discussed it?

[21:58] <timotimo> 8 minutes to go until the build finishes

[21:58] <timotimo> i wonder if a --no-tests flag exists

[22:21] <timotimo> welp.

[22:21] <timotimo> now all we need is hosting

[22:25] <Xliff> Haven't had a chance to.

[22:25] *** Manifest0 joined
[22:25] <timotimo> no problem

[22:26] <Xliff> Looking now, tho.

[22:26] <timotimo> there's no rush. it's not like i have the time&energy to really do anything with it

[22:26] *** rindolf left
[22:26] <timotimo> so please chill

[22:26] <Xliff> I can still look. :p

[22:29] <RaycatWhoDat> D'oh.

[22:29] <Xliff> timotimo: Dear ImGui would be something to play with starting late summer -> fall

[22:29] <RaycatWhoDat> p6: say 3

[22:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «3␤»

[22:29] <RaycatWhoDat> Sweet.

[22:31] <timotimo> simpleUser: i'm super tired now and will go to bed soon, but i built GTK3 DLLs on appveyor, want me to send them your way?

[22:34] <Xliff> timotimo: Latest project is porting Clutter: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Clutter

[22:36] <timotimo> i wonder if that'd be useful for anything video-game-like

[22:37] <Xliff> Yep.

[22:38] <timotimo> the clutter website seems very odd

[22:38] <timotimo> 1.12

[22:38] <timotimo> Target date for API freeze: 2012-08-22

[22:38] <timotimo> oh, they put the oldest stuff at the top

[22:38] <timotimo> not at the bottom

[22:40] <timotimo> all of this clutter stuff seems kind of stale

[22:42] <timotimo> jesus, i hope nothing in perl6-land is like this at all

[22:43] <timotimo> is clutter, like, stable?

[22:45] <timotimo> the last commit with actual source code changes is like a year old

[23:13] <simpleUser> thanks very much for you patience your timean your skill, didn't expect so much really enjoy. see you later :-)

[23:15] <timotimo> Xliff: you still here? i'd like to pass the gtk dlls on to you

[23:15] <Xliff> timotimo: Yup

[23:15] <timotimo> https://www.sharedrop.io/rooms/d279c8bf-9d31-4081-a7ad-b5bc3900220f

[23:16] <timotimo> good good.

[23:16] <timotimo> simpleUser: if you want them too you can connect there, too

[23:16] <Xliff> *slurp*

[23:16] <simpleUser> thanks that's nice

[23:16] <Xliff> timotimo: Thanks!

[23:17] <timotimo> i'm not sure how to get GTK::Simple to use them, though

[23:17] <timotimo> i hope Xliff can maybe have a look?

[23:17] <Xliff> I haven't used GTK::Simple in a while, either.

[23:17] <Xliff> I'm also about to go offline in a bit. 

[23:18] <simpleUser> no problem i'll test and experiment that soon i've downloded it

[23:18] *** espadrine_ left
[23:18] *** Manifest0 joined
[23:18] <timotimo> simpleUser: https://github.com/perl6/gtk-simple/blob/master/Build.pm - this file has the logic to find the dlls

[23:18] <Xliff> simpleUser: We can work on it more when I get back. If you have time tomorrow, I'll be around then, too.

[23:19] <timotimo> the hashes will for sure not match up with what's in the file

[23:19] <simpleUser> ok nice have a good night thanks again :-)

[23:19] <timotimo> and the filenames may also not match up

[23:19] <simpleUser> bye

[23:19] <simpleUser> ok

[23:19] <timotimo> ah, i see

[23:19] <timotimo> if the thing finds libgtk-3-0.dll at the start, it will say "yup, we have everything we need! nothing to do here!"

[23:20] <timotimo> so ... i guess if it's windows, you just dump all those dll files in C:/Windows/System/ or something?

[23:20] <simpleUser> that will be the ring a bell to GUI

[23:20] <simpleUser> yes system32

[23:20] <timotimo> but those are 64bit dlls

[23:20] <timotimo> so ... no clue how you handle that

[23:21] <timotimo> worst case just put the dlls in whatever folder you run "zef" and "perl6" from

[23:21] <timotimo> maybe it will also look next to perl6.exe?? perhaps?!?

[23:21] <simpleUser> no problem i'll be looking for

[23:21] <timotimo> or next to moar.exe

[23:21] <timotimo> i wish you the best of luck!

[23:21] <simpleUser> yes i hope so if they are aware of it and have time

[23:22] <simpleUser> thanks very nice

[23:43] <sena_kun> Xliff, what do you want? a custom value for enum label or?

[23:45] <Xliff> No.

[23:45] <sena_kun> hmm...

[23:45] <Xliff> Want to take name of enum key and get the entire pair.

[23:46] <Xliff> m: my enum TriLet <AAA BBB CCC>; my %h = ( AAA => 'aaaaa' ); say TriLet.hash

[23:47] <sena_kun> that's the more complex question...
