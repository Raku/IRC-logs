[14:53] *** antoniogamiz left
[14:53] <sena_kun> anyway, uzl, right, you are asking the correct question and the solution is not bad for Cyrillic character. There is even a sub for such a transition, I think, let me check...

[14:54] <sena_kun> https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str#method_trans <- this one

[14:55] <sena_kun> m: "хихихи".trans(["х", "и"] => ["h", "i"]).say

[14:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 56af07bf1: OUTPUT: «hihihi␤»

[14:55] <sena_kun> I see you already have hashes with substitutions, so likely can adapt the code to use `trans` method.

[14:56] <Voldenet> after writing some async code, I truly believe that Promise.in is an awkward name for an async version of sleep

[14:57] <sena_kun> but the more important part is what to do with languages that don't have some sort of alphabet, or have symbols that go beyond one, e.g. Chinese, Japanese and so on. I have no idea how to do that.

[14:57] <sena_kun> Voldenet, "A Promise that completes _in_ 5 seconds", is it awkward?

[14:58] <uzl> sena_kun: Oh, I see. As of now, I just pass whatever character to char2ascii and return it if it's in the hash. Otherwise, return the same passed character.

[14:59] <sena_kun> https://www.jeremyselier.com/entry/uslug.js-a-unicode-slug-generator <- here they don't convert Unicode into ASCII.

[14:59] <uzl> Do you think it's necessary to do it with .trans? Or is char2ascii just enough?

[15:00] <sena_kun> uzl, you can do either way, but I suspect that .trans is much more effective. Or it should be.

[15:00] <Voldenet> sena_kun: when you read it in async code, it reads slightly worse than "say 'a'; await delay(.1); say 'b'"

[15:00] <Voldenet> (I've just named it delay in my code, seems less awkward)

[15:00] *** sisar left
[15:00] *** antoniogamiz joined
[15:01] <uzl> sena_kun: Oh, I great. I'll read the article. The only thing about .trans is that I must know the characters a priori or that's what I think.

[15:02] <sena_kun> I wonder why are you required to use async one if you still await it just there, why not just `sleep`. And if you want to actually do some stuff on a timer, then `Promise.in(5).then(...)` reads not so bad.

[15:03] <Voldenet> $*SCHEDULER.cue({ … }, :in(.5))

[15:03] <uzl> For instance, if I wanted to transliterate "Компьютер", then I'd need each character's romanized version before using .trans. With char2ascii, I just give it a character and return whatever it has for it.

[15:04] <sena_kun> uzl, https://github.com/cocur/slugify/pull/195/files <- here they are using a dictionary of words.

[15:05] <sena_kun> and the results promise to be pretty useless, I believe.

[15:06] <sena_kun> uzl, you can do basically the same with .trans. of course, it won't work for Chinese.

[15:07] <uzl> What would be the reason for that?

[15:07] <sena_kun> Or, well, technically you can use a whole dictionary of symbols, but ugh. This is tricky.

[15:08] *** AlexDaniel joined
[15:08] <sena_kun> uzl, what is the purpose of your module? Do you want it for some specific usecase for people to use?

[15:09] <uzl> uzl: Don't worry! I'll look at the link you provided but instead of using a json file which then needs to be parsed, I'll just use a hash.

[15:10] <uzl> sena_kun: I need it for something I'm doing but I figured other people might find it useful so I packaged it as a module instead.

[15:11] *** sjm_uk left
[15:11] <uzl> I'll look at the link you provided but instead of using a json file which then needs to be parsed, I'll just use a hash right in the code.

[15:12] <sena_kun> uzl, can you set some scope of the project? If you want to convert _any_ human writing system that is in Unicode into ASCII, it seems like a research-level project.

[15:13] <sena_kun> this thing gets complicated fast

[15:14] *** Sgeo__ joined
[15:14] <uzl> Oh, not at all! That'd be too much. I'll add Chinese if only to pass the test that is still failing.

[15:15] <sena_kun> for example, in Japanese "体" can has ASCII of "karada", "katachi", also "tai" and "tei" depending on the situation. And it is a very simple case, there are kanji with more reading than those entry-level ones.

[15:16] <uzl> sena_kun: Anyway... Thanks for the all the help :)!

[15:16] <sena_kun> if you certainly need to support Chinese, then adopting a dictionary is your way. Don't forget to check licenses too, because this is pretty important.

[15:16] <sena_kun> if you don't, just remove the test. ;)

[15:17] <uzl> Sure, will do! Thanks!

[15:18] <Voldenet> sena_kun: Promise.in doesn't do the same stuff sleep does, consider this

[15:18] <Voldenet> m: for ^30 { $*SCHEDULER.cue({ say $_; sleep(.5); say $_ }) }; sleep 1

[15:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 56af07bf1: OUTPUT: «0␤1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤6␤7␤8␤9␤10␤11␤12␤13␤14␤15␤16␤17␤18␤19␤20␤21␤22␤23␤24␤25␤26␤27␤28␤0␤29␤1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤6␤7␤8␤9␤10␤11␤12␤13␤14␤15␤16␤17␤18␤19␤20␤21␤22␤23␤2…»

[15:18] <Voldenet> the output is different

[15:24] *** Manifest0 left
[15:26] <Voldenet> because Promise.in just tells the scheduler to return to the code after some time, sleep actually puts threads to sleep

[15:27] <sena_kun> I still have a feeling that `Promise.in` has more than one usage patterns, and using it as a delayer is not the single one.

[15:27] <sena_kun> e.g. https://github.com/croservices/cro/blob/3cf63cd6b3382a825fc76c5b10a60156de031d9d/lib/Cro/Tools/Services.pm6#L112 or https://github.com/croservices/cro/blob/5496766e9699ad8a51ad32cea5067870af78e3c7/lib/Cro/Tools/Runner.pm6#L135

[15:28] <sena_kun> I am not too familiar with .cue, though, so just ignore me, please. :)

[15:28] <mst> Voldenet: also commonly used for timeouts

[15:28] <Voldenet> mst: that's what I'm using it for - timeouts

[15:29] *** jeromelanteri left
[15:29] *** Manifest0 joined
[15:29] <mst> right, over in perl5 where we've got a few more years experience, we tend to refer to 'succeeds after N seconds' as a delay and 'fails after N seconds' as a timeout

[15:29] <mst> so when you said 'as a delayer' I assumed the former

[15:29] *** molaf joined
[15:30] *** antoniogamiz left
[15:33] <Voldenet> Actually, it's a task for failing a connection when it hasn't authenticated itself for N seconds, so after the delay it checks some condition and drops the connection

[15:33] <Voldenet> so it's kind of a timeout, but the other way around

[16:28] <louisono> ok so I'm trying to use phasers

[16:56] <Voldenet> and you get the funny little warning

[16:57] <louisono> haha that's weird indeed

[16:58] <louisono> anyway thanks for pointing out a way to avoid the unexpected behaviour I encountered in the first place

[16:59] <Voldenet> "LAST" phaser doesn't seem to be most used feature though, I'm pretty sure I've never used it

[17:00] <louisono> ok I was just curious since I'm still in the learning phase where I "play" with the language and try things out

[19:23] <pepeperl> Hi. Can I ask what is the prefered way to install perl 6 that provides a package manager? is it rakudo star? And if yes, would it provide zef as the package manager? There are a couple of options on the downloads page, not cear what's the primary / preferred one. Thx

[19:24] <moritz> pepeperl: what operating sytem are you using?

[19:24] <pepeperl> debian

[19:24] <moritz> then I recommend https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/#os-repositories

[19:25] <moritz> and also read https://nxadm.github.io/rakudo-pkg/#zef-module-manager-as-a-regular-user

[19:26] *** Manifest0 joined
[19:26] <pepeperl> global zef installing packages in  $HOME, got it :)

[19:28] <pepeperl> moritz could you provide a tl;dr on rakudo-pkg vs rakudo star?

[19:29] <moritz> pepeperl: rakudo-pkg is debian packaged

[19:29] <moritz> and is only rakudo + zef, afaict

[19:29] <moritz> rakudo star also installs some other modules

[19:29] *** redhands left
[19:31] <pepeperl> ok I'll just give it a try with your suggestion. Thanks for the advice

[19:42] *** patrickb joined
[19:44] <pepeperl> hmm... I've ran the add-perl6-to-path script and confirmed that perl6 -v is working, but the install-zef-as-user script is failing with a bunch of "Failed to update cpan/p6c mirror" erors. Any advice?

[19:45] *** xinming-pad joined
[19:46] *** xinming-pad left
[19:46] <pepeperl> looked in the script, not many cues

[19:47] <lizmat> hmmm... I wonder if that zef is still using the broken links ??

[19:47] <lizmat> El_Che ^^

[19:47] <tyil> matiaslina: .

[19:49] <pepeperl> lizmat maybe? https://pastebin.com/uAnmzwkc

[19:49] <El_Che> hi, rakudo-pkg packager here

[19:49] <pepeperl> El_Che hi

[19:50] <lizmat> http://ecosystem-api.p6c.org/projects1.json  works for me

[19:50] <pepeperl> my browser gets it fine too

[19:50] <El_Che> weird

[19:50] <lizmat> pepeperl: if you paste that URL in a browser, does it do something for you ?

[19:51] <El_Che> what the script does is install a vanilla zef from github according to the zef instructions. No magic there

[19:51] <pepeperl> lizmat yes, as I just said, it shows the json fine

[19:51] <El_Che> pepeperl: try curling the url on the same shell you're running the script

[19:51] <El_Che> (or wget)

[19:52] <pepeperl> good point

[19:53] <pepeperl> just installed debian 10 and it ended upobeing rather spartan, like no lspci spartan

[19:53] <pepeperl> also no curl

[19:53] <pepeperl> it works afterinstalling curl

[19:54] <pepeperl> oh this is going to be causing me a lot of unrelated headaches...

[20:00] *** TreyHarris joined
[20:01] <El_Che> pepeperl: https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#what-about-rakudo-star

[20:02] <El_Che> zo in short, with rakudo-pkg you get the runtime and the pkg manager in a OS package, with rakudo start you get a selection of preinstalled modules and the runtime, all to be compiled locally

[20:02] <El_Che> my mindset is getting the base and installing what I need

[20:03] <pepeperl> yeah, it does feel leaner. 

[20:04] <El_Che> I need to find the time to release Windows and MacOS pakages, but Linux is covered so far :)

[20:05] <El_Che> and macos also by homebrew since they added a rakudo pkg next to rakudo-star

[20:15] <TreyHarris> I _really_ need to move this virtual onto an SSD, I forgot to start restoring it before bed after the power came back and it only just now came back online

[20:16] <TreyHarris> I would've been fine except the power blipped about twenty minutes before the 4-hour outage and it didn't have time to finish fsck in the interim

[20:17] <TreyHarris> I stopped bothering with a UPS after we went ten years without an outage in Manhattan... my last UPS died just last year. whoops.
