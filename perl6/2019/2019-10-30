[12:04] <hungryd27> hello, does Perl6 have a way to handle matrices?

[12:04] <hungryd27> I need to do some math

[12:10] <hungryd27> Hello everyoneÔºåI need to do some math about matrices. 

[12:10] *** wamba joined
[12:14] <tadzik> hungryd27: https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix may be what you need

[12:14] <tadzik> I found it on https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=matrix :)

[12:14] <hungryd27> Oh, thanks.

[14:18] <Ulti> the only downside to that implementation is you end up with perl6 lists of rats very easily... rather than native arrays of floats or something a bit more efficient/vectorisable 

[14:19] <Ulti> its not a binding to low level libs like blas/lapack or anything

[14:30] <Ulti> "Multiple shapes not yet understood" for native arrays is I guess one of the reasons no one has gone here yet

[14:39] <timotimo> native arrays are working very well, and have not-terrible performance

[14:39] <timotimo> the performance of native *shaped* arrays and shaped arrays in general is poor, though. barely any optimization work has gone into them as far as i know

[14:48] <Ulti> timotimo: at the moment you can't even define them though 

[14:49] <timotimo> can you give an example?

[14:49] <Ulti> you also can't do C like trickery where you allocate a big single dim but access with multi dimensions

[14:49] <timotimo> m: my int @foo[5,4]

[14:49] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 9f433da0d: OUTPUT: ¬´¬ª

[14:49] <timotimo> m: my int @foo[5][4]

[14:49] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 9f433da0d: OUTPUT: ¬´(exit code 1) 04===SORRY!04=== Error while compiling /tmp/Hx2TMuu2tU‚ê§Multipl‚Ä¶¬ª

[14:49] <evalable6> timotimo, Full output: https://gist.github.com/3425d99f7caf2877433f63d538c39c47

[14:49] <timotimo> is that what you tried?

[14:50] <Ulti> the second one yeah

[14:50] <timotimo> i honestly have no clue what "multiple shapes" means

[14:50] <Ulti> so is the first a 5 by 4 2D array?

[14:50] <timotimo> yes

[14:50] <Ulti> lol then for real what is the second o____O

[14:50] <timotimo> m: my int @foo[5,4]; @foo[3,2] = 1

[14:50] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 9f433da0d: OUTPUT: ¬´(exit code 1) Partially dimensioned views of shaped arrays not yet implemented. Sorry.‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/RP3Zm8oiGq line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[14:51] <timotimo> m: my int @foo[5,4]; @foo[3;2] = 1; say @foo.perl

[14:51] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 9f433da0d: OUTPUT: ¬´array[int].new(:shape(5, 4), [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0])‚ê§¬ª

[14:53] <Ulti> so I guess multi shape is you say it can be a 1D and a 2D or something? like you have different dimensioned views?  so  int @weirdthing[10][5,2] = ^10;

[14:53] <timotimo> oh? i have no idea how to actually use that tho?

[14:54] <Ulti> that is pure speculation but my only guess at what it could possibly do as valid syntax if [x,y] is the syntax for a 2D declaration

[14:54] <timotimo> hm, greppable6 uses perl6 regex, right?

[14:55] <timotimo> greppable6: my \s+ int \s+ "@" <ident> \s* \[\d+\]\[\d+\]

[14:55] <greppable6> timotimo, Found nothing!

[14:55] <timotimo> greppable6: help

[14:55] <greppable6> timotimo, Like this: greppable6: password # See wiki for more examples: https://github.com/perl6/whateverable/wiki/Greppable

[14:55] <timotimo> oh, module ecosystem, not spec tests

[14:56] <timotimo> and perl5 regex, too

[14:56] <Ulti> also it feels bad that I could have been using multi dim native arrays this whole time

[14:57] <timotimo> performance is, like, really bad though
