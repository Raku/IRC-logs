[14:12] <Tirifto> Hello all!

[14:20] *** go|dfish joined
[14:22] <timotimo> o/

[14:26] <Tirifto> I'm going to try and write a (fairly simple) program in Perl 6, or nowadays rather in Raku, which I'm new to! I already got familiar with Perl 5, and Raku looks like it keeps everything that made me like it and adds much more. I haven't seen any other language encourage the usage of all the various Unicode symbols in the code, so I already like Raku a lot for that. So far I've only been having good impressions, so I thought I'd mention th

[14:26] <Tirifto> at here. :-)

[14:27] <timotimo> good to hear :)

[14:27] *** wamba left
[14:28] <timotimo> people often react a little exasperated when they see the atomic operators :D

[14:28] <timotimo> well, that's what my tweetdeck column that searches for mentions of perl6 and such would have me believe

[14:28] *** go|dfish left
[14:30] <Tirifto> I find that odd; the atomic operators are ingenious! :D

[14:32] <timotimo> not only that, they also all have an alternative that's just a sub made of normal letters

[14:32] <timotimo> perl6 thinks "different things should look different" and "rare or dangerous things should stand out" or something like that

[14:33] <timotimo> which is why EVAL was made upper case, and why phasers are uppercased, including CATCH, and why BUILD and TWEAK methods are as well

[14:37] <Tirifto> Seems like a good convention, though I haven't dabbled in the affected much.

[15:09] <Tirifto> Is ‚Äòtwigil‚Äô a combination of ‚Äòtweak‚Äô and ‚Äòsigil‚Äô?

[15:18] <tobs> Tirifto: I think "tw" comes from "two", as in secondary sigil. They add orthogonal information to, not tweak, the primary sigil. In my undestanding anyway

[15:23] <tobs> Tirifto: the synopsis is not explicit about where it comes from, but points in that direction: https://github.com/perl6/specs/blob/master/S02-bits.pod#twigils

[15:23] <Tirifto> tobs: Ah, thanks!

[15:24] <Tirifto> I also think I finally managed to install Rakudo and Zef! 

[15:29] <timotimo> tw is short for twecondary!

[17:11] <samcv> what is the state of relocatable builds? i want to try and get perl6 into my workplace. a coworker said there were some issues when they tried 2 months ago to create a centos spec file because installing to directory X where final directory is Y didn't work properly. anything i need to know?

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I think 2019.10 will be the first release that's relocatable

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> samcv: which will happen pretty soon, actually, are you up for some releasing?

[18:44] <AlexDaniel> :)

[18:45] <AlexDaniel> we're not ready yet, but given the current state of things, I'm optimistic

[19:11] <samcv> i was looking into a bug you opened today. bugs in .samemark. so i should probably be fixing that tomorrow.
