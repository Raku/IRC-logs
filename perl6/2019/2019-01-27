[00:12] <leont> It seems IO::Path.dir gives less than awesome error messages

[00:12] <leont> Failed to get the directory contents of '/var/spool/cups': Failed to open dir: 13

[00:13] <leont> 13 means "permission denied", but somehow it prints the number instead of the message

[00:14] <leont> Also, returning a Failure object when the user is expecting a Sequence is not very helpful (use fatal was though)

[00:17] *** MasterDuke left
[00:24] <leont> It works fine when iterating over it immediately, but not so much when putting it in an array first :-/

[00:25] <El_Che> That would be a nasty surprise

[00:26] <leont> m: my @foo = "/var/spool/cups".IO.dir; dd @foo

[00:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «Array @foo = [Failure.new(exception => X::IO::Dir.new(path => "/var/spool/cups", os-error => "Failed to open dir: 13"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)]␤»

[00:26] <leont> That

[00:26] <El_Che> I wonder if, unlike the Java-like failure throwing, the style of (return value, error) returns (like in Go) make defensive programming easier 

[00:28] <leont> One could argue Failure should blow up when listified, but I'm not sure I can see all the implications of that

[00:29] <El_Che> catch it early or catch it later

[00:30] <El_Che> it would break loops like "read all these files and show me their contents or error code"

[00:46] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; my @foo = willfail; say @foo.perl

[00:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «[Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "oh no"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)]␤»

[00:46] <timotimo> yeah, that's not so cool

[00:46] <timotimo> but it's not being sunk, and sinking a failure or trying to work with it is what blows it up

[00:46] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; my @foo = willfail.list; say @foo.perl

[00:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «[Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "oh no"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)]␤»

[00:47] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; my @foo = willfail.eager; say @foo.perl

[00:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «[Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "oh no"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)]␤»

[00:48] *** dct left
[00:49] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; for willfail { .perl.say }

[00:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5===␤Function 'willfail' needs parens to avoid gobbling block␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3il "oh no" }; for willfail { .perl.say }7⏏5<EOL>␤Missing block (apparently claimed by 'willfail')␤at <tmp>:1␤------> 3il "oh no" }; for …»

[00:49] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; for willfail() { .perl.say }

[00:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «Failure.new(exception => X::AdHoc.new(payload => "oh no"), backtrace => Backtrace.new)␤»

[00:50] <timotimo> failure is also a thing for cases when you're doing a whole bunch of things in parallel and you want to finish stuff before a single failure blows everything up

[00:50] <timotimo> so that necessitates that failures can go into lists

[00:52] <El_Che> or when failure is a expected return (my reading lots of files examples)

[00:53] <El_Che> the "13" exit code is LTA in this case, indeed

[00:53] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; for try willfail() { .perl.say }

[00:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «Nil␤»

[00:53] <leont> I don't mind it going into a list, but it shouldn't become a list

[00:53] <timotimo> well, assigning to a @foo will turn things into lists

[00:53] <leont> Obviously. That's where I want it to fail ;-)

[00:53] <leont> s/fail/throw/

[00:53] <El_Che> oh, I see what you mean now

[00:54] <timotimo> m: sub willfail { fail "oh no" }; for willfail.self { .perl.say }

[00:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 71a19c61a: OUTPUT: «oh no␤  in sub willfail at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[00:55] <leont> Yeah, self or use fatal will make it DWIM, but it's still non-intuitive behavior

[00:58] <timotimo> agreed

[03:37] <Xliff> Now I need ideas for other things to do with what I have. Suggestions welcome! :)

[03:37] <Xliff> Simple GTK apps would be nice.

[03:38] <Xliff> Like... I'm not currently able to write a media player, yet. But wouldn't mind helping create one. :)

[03:41] *** aborazmeh left
[03:47] <Xliff> Is there any way to distribute a module through zef that has already been precompiled?

[03:48] *** ufobat_ joined
[03:48] <Xliff> p6-GtkPlus is already clocking in at 30 minutes using optimal build order, and I'd prefer if end users didn't have to endure that prior to getting their hands dirty.

[03:48] <Xliff> Maybe I could have said that better.

[03:49] <Xliff> s/hands dirty/feet wet/

[03:49] <Xliff> ??

[03:52] *** ufobat__ left
[03:53] <vrurg> Xliff: WOW! Amazing!

[03:54] <Xliff> vrurg: :) Thanks.

[03:54] <Xliff> Unfortunately, depends on GTKPlus, which depends on Pango which has a blocker.

[03:54] <Xliff> Actually, I need to make an issue on that so I can track it.

[03:58] *** jast left
[03:58] *** jast joined
[04:01] *** zacts joined
[04:04] <Xliff> OK. So I am currently stuck on p6-Pango with the two issues listed. Once those are fixed, I can release Pango, and p6-GtkPlus

[04:05] <Xliff> Once those are released p6-WebkitGTK is only a week's worth of work behind.

[04:05] <Xliff> Until then, to use everything I've been working on, you have to go through a lot of shite.

[04:06] <Xliff> See instructions for  https://github.com/Xliff/p6-VisualGrammar

[05:01] <Xliff> hahainternet: I hear you. Right now I am using a module I converted from Javascript. See http://github.com/Xliff/p6-RandomColor

[05:01] <Xliff> hahainternet: If there were an algorithm to generate random colors... or even an infinite set of colors for colorblind users, I would implement it in a second.

[05:02] <Xliff> Or, at the very least, something that I could use to convert a RandomColor to something colorblind-aware.

[05:02] <Xliff> Thanks for the suggestion! Could you add an issue to RandomColor?

[05:02] <hahainternet> Xliff: the problem is people fail to understand colourblindness

[05:02] <Xliff> I know.

[05:02] <hahainternet> it's not just a question of being unable to see absolute colours

[05:02] <hahainternet> but also adjacent colour differences

[05:02] <Xliff> Yes. And I know I need further education on that.

[05:02] <hahainternet> i also am not aware of any algorithm for picking optimal colours

[05:02] <hahainternet> but i have seen colourblind schemes before

[05:03] <hahainternet> i've got time tomorrow, i'll do a bit of research ☺

[05:03] <Xliff> Be aware that p6-VisualGrammar does attempt to prevent colors too adjacent to each other.

[05:03] <Xliff> =D

[05:03] <hahainternet> yes, the problem is that the 'too adjacent' map is generally based on colour distance

[05:03] <hahainternet> but obviously that map changes when you have broken eyes :(

[05:03] <Xliff> I am very grateful for interested persons who find a problem and are willing to offer a solution.

[05:04] <hahainternet> i'd like to know the correct solution tbqh

[05:04] <Xliff> Yeah. Me too.

[05:04] <hahainternet> it's a problem i encouter a lot, as i have bad red/green and a weak blue channel i think

[05:04] <Xliff> It is more an issue for RandomColor than it is for VisualGrammar, tbh

[05:04] <Xliff> Ah.

[05:04] <hahainternet> it's 5am for me so i won't be able to do much now

[05:04] <Xliff> No worries. I am patient.

[05:04] <hahainternet> but it's on my list for tomorrow now :D

[05:04] <Xliff> :)

[05:05] <Xliff> Do you think you could just add a quick issue to http://github.com/Xliff/p6-RandomColor?

[05:05] <Xliff> I don't need details, just a quick notice.

[05:06] <hahainternet> yeah can do

[16:48] <moritz> ok, I now know why perl6-all-modules doesn't include many of the Cro-related modules

[16:48] <moritz> the job starts by downloading https://modules.perl6.org/s/from:cpan/.json

[16:48] <moritz> and then for each distribution, it looks at the "url" field

[16:49] <moritz> and expects a link to a tarball, but finds for example https://github.com/croservices/cro-core.git

[16:50] <moritz> where other modules contain URLs like http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/H/HO/HOLYGHOST/Perl/AI-Agent-0.2.7.tar.gz

[16:50] <moritz> my problem is, I have no idea if my script should be able to deal with git URLs, or if something is wrong

[16:51] <moritz> and if yes, if it's in modules.perl6.org, or with the Cro dists, or something else

[16:51] <hahainternet> github always gets special cased in dep managers, frustratingly

[16:51] <hahainternet> same is true for Go

[16:55] <Harzilein> sometimes gitlab gets special cased too

[16:57] <moritz> http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/5c4de2fd.326b.c7

[16:58] <moritz> what's the point to upload things to CPAN if our meta data doesn't even contain links to the CPAN URLs?

[20:36] <hahainternet> Xliff: so i did some reading, and it seems the theory is fairly well established, in the standard colourspace diagram, a series of lines radiating from one of 3 points models deficiency in one colour receptor set

[20:36] <hahainternet> but specific algorithms to reduce the colourspace to a linear pick i don't yet know

[20:36] <hahainternet> so i'll get back to you if i find something :p
