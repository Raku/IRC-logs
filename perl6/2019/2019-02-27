[10:06] <sena_kun> patrickb, what is your command? just `zef install NativeHelpers::Blob`?

[10:06] *** cpan-p6 joined
[10:07] <patrickb> sena_kun: I tried: `zef install NH::B`, `zef update` then `zef install NH::B`, `zef uninstall NH::B` then `zef install NH::B`, `zef upgrade NH::B`

[10:09] <patrickb> Could it be, that zef won't refetch the repo as long as the version number does not increase in the repo?

[10:10] <sena_kun> it may be it.

[10:11] <sena_kun> but I wonder why it didn't work out after uninstall.

[10:11] <patrickb> :-( That would mean, that people end up having different things installed, depending on when they installed it in the first place.

[10:11] <discord6> <kawaii> I think that's correct, with my own module I just resorted to cloning it and doing zef install $PWD each time I want to update it.

[10:11] <patrickb> I think that's worth a bug report for zef.

[10:12] <sena_kun> well, the github approach is a bit fragile anyway, I think. I wonder if something like stackage can be suitable.

[10:14] <discord6> <kawaii> I wonder why cpan5 wasn't just duplicated for perl6?

[10:15] <patrickb> kawaii: Well we are reusing cpan5 in perl6. The ecosystem is rather quickly moving over there currently.

[10:16] <discord6> <kawaii> ecosystem aside, is this the correct place to post lengthy (and messy) perl 6 code snippets that are buggy and ask where I should even start debugging it? :]

[10:17] <sena_kun> it is the right place. :)

[10:18] <discord6> <kawaii> This is part of my first real Perl 6 application, so be kind. :]  https://gist.github.com/kawaii/32762d9cf40ee73c4972d3434ed8b61c  my problem lies within the grant-level-roles routine, which will sometimes freak out and assign a user all or some of the role IDs from the %level-roles hash, and I'm really unsure why or where I need to start debugging the issue.

[10:19] *** cpan-p6 left
[10:20] <discord6> <kawaii> i.e. it assigns the user roles which they don't have the required experience points for, so maybe the issues lies in the calculate-level or get-user-xp routines?

[10:27] <sena_kun> are you sure there are no races in calling code?

[10:28] <sena_kun> I don't see anything too wrong with your gist, but "sometimes it behaves odd, but most of the time it is ok" sounds like a race to me.

[10:35] <discord6> <kawaii> I don't understand how it can be a race condition though when surely I'm just doing a single query to get a value from the database, and using that in some synchronous routines.

[10:36] *** zakharyas left
[10:37] <sena_kun> well, I don't see any top-level calls or MAIN, so I have assumed you are calling this code from some outer place. If it is synchronous too, then I wonder what it can be.

[10:39] <discord6> <kawaii> sena_kun: I have extended the gist with my MAIN :]

[10:39] <discord6> <kawaii> that code is async, but I wasn't aware it could cause issues in the way it is

[10:42] *** rindolf left
[10:42] <sena_kun> well, no, `whenever` is thread-safe.

[10:42] <sena_kun> so it likely can't hurt as far as I understand it.

[11:02] <sena_kun> not yet merged though.

[11:04] <patrickb> sena_kun: As you say. But I'd say that's the minor part of that project. So once that branch is merged I'd ask brrt to change the description a little and all is good.

[16:45] <jkramer> Is there a workaround for using URI with URLs that contain unicode characters? I tried URI.new($u.decode) but then it dies saying it only allows named arguments

[16:45] *** cpan-p6 left
[16:45] *** cpan-p6 joined
[16:45] <jmerelo> jkramer: that's unrelated. You probably need to find out what's the name of the named argument it's looking for.

[16:46] <jkramer> There's already an issue but it's pretty old and no one seems to care :/ https://github.com/perl6-community-modules/uri/issues/38

[16:46] <jmerelo> jkramer: right... those community modules really need some love.

[16:46] <jkramer> jmerelo: Well URI.new($url) works when $url is a Str

[16:47] <jmerelo> jkramer: looking at the source now, trying to figure it out...

[16:47] <jmerelo> but $u.decode might not be a string. Maybe it's a Buf?

[16:48] <jkramer> Yes it is, I was just trying stuff to work around the unicode problem :)

[16:48] *** ChristopherBotto joined
[16:48] <jkramer> So apparently it only accepts Str and they may not contain "special" unicode characters, including umlauts :/

[16:48] <timotimo> i think you have to use URI.parse rather than URI.new?

[16:48] <jmerelo> jkramer: there are only two "new", both take a Str, one as a named argument, the other as a positional. You will need to render it to a Str

[16:48] <timotimo> oh

[16:48] <timotimo> nope

[16:49] *** choiboi left
[16:49] <jmerelo> jkramer: it accepts special characters as long as they are rendered to a Str, is what I understand.

[16:49] <jkramer> timotimo: Just looking at the code, .new just calls .parse

[16:49] <timotimo> OK. when you're not passing the Str $uri or Str :$uri, you'll get the default constructor, which probably wants to be shadowed

[16:50] <jmerelo> ChristopherBotto: Hi!

[16:50] <jkramer> Ah

[16:50] <timotimo> greetings

[16:50] <ChristopherBotto> I'm not able to download rakudo-star to our cluster.

[16:50] <ChristopherBotto> wget https://rakudo.org/dl/star/rakudo-star-2018.10.tar.gz

[16:50] <jmerelo> ChristopherBotto: 404?

[16:51] <timotimo> rakudo.org doesn't seem to work at the moment?

[16:51] <ChristopherBotto> But I can from my laptop, but I have to use --no-check-certificate

[16:51] <jmerelo> it does for me?

[16:51] <timotimo> oh, so maybe only https is broken?

[16:51] <timotimo> that's not it, either

[16:52] <jmerelo> If it works only for some, could it be some DNS problem?

[16:52] <timotimo> on my end rakudo.org gives the front page to the p6c servers

[16:52] <ChristopherBotto> I even installed a new copy of wget with openssl, but it doesn't work.

[16:52] <jmerelo> Maybe it has not propagated everywhere?

[16:52] <ChristopherBotto> But downloading perl5 from an HTTPS address isn't a problem (i.e. wget https://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/perl-5.28.1.tar.gz)

[16:53] <timotimo> it's a v4/v6 thing

[16:53] <timotimo> ChristopherBotto: you can pass -4 to wget, that may work

[16:54] <ChristopherBotto> Wow. -4 did the trick. Thanks timotimo!

[16:55] <jkramer> jmerelo: What did you mean with "rendered to a Str"?

[16:58] *** cpan-p6 left
[16:58] *** cpan-p6 joined
[16:59] *** brrt`` joined
[16:59] <ChristopherBotto> It looks like IPv6 for rakudo.org is what is having issues, as far as I can tell.

[16:59] <jmerelo> jkramer: you can convert a buf to a string, interpreting it as utf8-c8 or whatever. Let me see if I find how.

[17:00] <jmerelo> jkramer: right, it's simply decode. it will decode to UTF8 by default. Maybe you need utf8-c8. I'd need to see the whole thing.

[17:01] *** AlexDaniel joined
[17:03] <jkramer> jmerelo: So I need to encode my Str to utf8/utf8-c8 first and then decode it back to Str using some other encoding, hoping the validation won't complain?

[17:04] <jmerelo> jkramer: that very much depend on where your string comes from. if it's already a Str, you should be good to go. If you're reading it raw from somewhere, you might need to decode using that to a Str.

[17:05] <jmerelo> jkramer: but it's always better to see the whole thing, if possible. It might still be a URI bug, the one you've pointed to. Let me see if I can add a test or something.

[17:05] <jkramer> jmerelo: It's already a Str, but it's not accepted. I tried fooling URI by decoding/encoding it but nothing seems to work. :/

[17:05] <jkramer> jmerelo: The whole thing: URI.new('http://test.de/Ã¶')

[17:06] <jmerelo> jkramer: OK; let's try then with a test.

[17:06] *** abraxxa left
[17:06] <timotimo> encoding something as utf8-c8 and decoding it as utf8 on the other end will give you a fun surprise

[17:07] <jkramer> timotimo: Tried that to, decoding it works but than URI complains again that it can't work with the Ã¶ :)

[17:07] *** scimon joined
[17:07] <jkramer> I'm too tired for typing propertly

[17:08] <jmerelo> jkramer: this works: $u = URI.new(uri-escape('http://test.de/Ã¶'));

[17:09] <jmerelo> Let's see if it also does what is should do

[17:09] <timotimo> Ã¶ isn't something that utf8-c8 would be useful for anyway

[17:10] <jmerelo> without the uri-escape it says "could not parse URI". But I think we shouldn't need to uri-escape to, well, create an URI. 

[17:10] <jkramer> jmerelo: uri-escape with the full url generates this: http%3A%2F%2Ftest.de%2F%C3%B6

[17:10] <jmerelo> jkramer: I hadn't seen that, but anyway that's bad.

[17:10] <jkramer> I think it's only meant for parameters and stuff, not the whole URL

[17:10] <jmerelo> jkramer: correct

[17:11] *** cpan-p6 left
[17:11] *** cpan-p6 joined
[17:12] <jmerelo> jkramer: it's using a grammar

[17:13] <jmerelo> jkramer: and the grammar is not tested...

[17:13] <jkramer> Yep I've had a short look at it but no idea what it's doing with those pchar and unenc-pchar thingies

[17:13] *** abraxxa joined
[17:15] <timotimo> domain names aren't urlencoded, they are punycode-encoded

[17:15] <jmerelo> Well token uri-alpha         { <[A..Za..z]> };

[17:15] <timotimo> only the part after the / (fragment?) is urlencoded if at all

[17:17] *** abraxxa left
[17:18] <jmerelo> jkramer: fixed and bumped up version

[17:18] <jmerelo> jkramer: it was an error in the grammar.

[17:19] <jmerelo> Version 0.1.6 should be good to go. clone it from the repo, but I think that zef will download the new version anyway.

[17:20] <ChristopherBotto> jmerelo and timtimo: thanks for helping me diagnose rakudo.org issue. Signing off.

[17:30] <MidCheck> Hi, jmerelo

[17:30] <MidCheck> I saw Google Summer of Code ideas for Perl projects and I am happy to participate in this project.

[17:31] <discord6> <Rogue> Do you have a link to the ideas?

[17:31] <jmerelo> MidCheck: you're very welcome! 

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> MidCheck: nice! Any particular topic you like?

[17:31] <jmerelo> MidCheck: there's the organization page https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4713351599357952/; the ideas page is linked from there

[17:31] <discord6> <Rogue> Thanks

[17:31] <jmerelo> MidCheck: you can check out the ideas already posted, or post new ones as issues. If you want a bit of orientation, just ask!

[17:32] <MidCheck> i like Improving Decoding Modularity and Implementing the GB2312 Encoding (Simplified Chinese)

[17:33] *** abraxxa joined
[17:33] <discord6> <Rogue> Oh boy, "Documentation Tooling Revamp" sounds like a lot of fun

[17:33] <jmerelo> It could be

[17:34] <jkramer> jmerelo: Awesome, thanks!

[17:34] <jmerelo> And it will have a big impact on the community. And it involves a lot of low-to-intermediate Perl 6 to learn. Plus it's something we sorely need

[17:34] <jmerelo> jkramer: sure :-)

[17:34] <discord6> <Rogue> Oh man, if we could get single executables for programs, that would be fantastic. I have a friend who would use Perl 6 but needs to be able to ship a single executable

[17:35] <jmerelo> Rogue: just suggest it as a project, in an issue, or if you want to be a mentor, as a full-fledged project. I think that would be nice too.

[17:36] <discord6> <Rogue> I was referring to "Linking Perl 6 Compiler and Programs" on the ideas list

[17:36] <jmerelo> MidCheck: it's Samantha McVey who's proposed that project. You can try and contact her through an issue to the site, mentioning her. She's here from time, too.

[17:37] <jmerelo> .seen samcv

[17:37] <yoleaux> I saw samcv 07:00Z in #perl6: <samcv> do we have any perl 5 projects?

[17:38] <jmerelo> Rogue Oh, I had missed that one. 

[17:39] <MidCheck> jmerelo: thank you, I found her in the list and sent hello

[17:39] * DrForr waves weakly.

[17:39] <discord6> <Rogue> Does Moar actually depend on any shared libs during runtime?

[17:39] <jmerelo> MidCheck: great. Good luck!

[17:39] <MidCheck> But my country has restricted some websites so that I can't access it.

[17:39] <jmerelo> o/ DrForr

[17:39] <jmerelo> MidCheck: where are you from if I may ask?

[17:39] <DrForr> MidCheck: VPN?

[17:39] <AlexDaniel> hm, maybe it's a good idea to have a project related to tooling for rakudo releasesâ¦ this way we'd at least find a new release manager :)

[17:39] <MidCheck> China

[17:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: do propose it.

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: ok what's the process exactly? I'm a bit lost

[17:41] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: full-fledged project (with mentors), PR with file following that format. Half-baked, an issue. They we'll try to find mentors, if the students go for it.

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: ok

[17:42] *** aindilis left
[17:42] <MidCheck> DrForr: my country has blocked all vpn sites and cannot download them.

[17:42] <jmerelo> MidCheck: but that might be a problem. Can you work with GitHub then?

[17:43] <MidCheck> jmerelo: yes, i can

[17:44] <jmerelo> MidCheck: then you're good to go, I guess, although filling some forms might be a problem. Just check with us if you need help there when the time to apply comes.

[17:50] <jmerelo> MidCheck: happy to serve :-)

[17:52] <Kaiepi> i've been looking through the page on the perl foundation in google's summer of code and came across this in https://perl-gsoc-2019.github.io/ideas/perl6/linking.html

[17:52] <Kaiepi> perl6 --compile foo.pl6 would generate an executable that would be, to some reasonable degree, self-contained (for instance, could be copied to a docker container).

[17:52] <Kaiepi> i wouldn't recommend this, docker doesn't run on openbsd

[17:53] <jmerelo> Kaiepi: do you suggest to just eliminate the reference to Docker?

[17:53] <Kaiepi> sure

[17:53] <brrt``> ho

[17:54] <brrt``> I think there's a misunderstanding

[17:54] <jmerelo> hi, brrt`` 

[17:54] <brrt``> what i meant by that is, it is 'self-contained', and can be copied integrally, without copying the interpreter, its environment

[17:54] <brrt``> hi jmerel

[17:54] <brrt``> hi jmerelo

[17:54] *** rindolf left
[17:55] <brrt``> it's a reference to a potential use case, not a solution

[17:55] <Kaiepi> oh

[17:55] <brrt``> maybe that wants a clarification

[17:55] <Kaiepi> yeah

[17:56] <jmerelo> brrt``: you can actually create docker containers right now without making any big fuss. Having a single file makes it only marginally easier.

[17:56] <brrt``> I know :-)

[17:56] <Kaiepi> tbf you can use docker on openbsd, but you need an alpine vm for it

[17:57] <jmerelo> brrt``: maybe a better use case could be used. Like "turnkey projects for customers", "protect intellectual property", I don't know, that kind of stuff

[17:58] <brrt``> I think the idea is 'copyable to a compatible machine'

[17:59] *** cpan-p6 left

[17:59] *** hobbs left
[17:59] <jmerelo> brrt``: if that's OK for Kaiepi and yourself, I might add something like that.

[17:59] <brrt``> alright, /me afk

[22:23] <antoniogamiz> thundergnat: mmm I will keep that in mind! gonna take a look at the link then

[22:23] <thundergnat> If / when you do get it installed, do a >perl6 -v to see what version you have. Anything older than 2018.06 is probably worth looking for something more recent.

[22:25] <antoniogamiz> the official package installed a version frrom 2015 O.o
