[11:41] <Xliff> OK. Next bit. I have a list of ids in an array. I want to pass them through a sub (as the only argument) in batches of 5 using hyper.

[11:43] *** cpan-p6 joined
[11:43] <Xliff> Thanks!

[11:44] <Altai-man_> afaik, `>>` is _meant_ to automagically introduce concurrency execution, but I am not sure how well it goes in reality right now. but with explicit hyper with a degree set it is a sure bet.

[11:45] <Xliff> Ah! Thankee!

[11:53] <Xliff> does DBIish support making a query from two different database connections?

[11:54] *** lizmat left
[11:58] <sortiz> You can open as many DB connections as you need, but you must made the query in every connection. (A query is a execution of a StatementHandle bound to a particular Connection)

[12:01] <Xliff> So I can't make a query using tables from two different connections?

[12:03] <Xliff> Or not... maybe this suggestion will work... ;q

[14:50] <discord6> <kawaii> if there is a documented workflow, CI spec and someone willing to teach me the ropes then I'm happy to volunteer

[14:50] <discord6> <kawaii> AlexDaniel: ? ^

[14:50] <Altai-man_> https://github.com/rakudo/star <- see "Release Guide"

[14:50] <Altai-man_> and if you mean Rakudo releases too, it has its own document.

[14:51] <discord6> <kawaii> I'm happy to take a look at, and manage Star, if I can get this built later without any issues and no one objects :]

[14:52] <Altai-man_> I think no one will. You also need to get access to the repo, and then go for it. AFAIK it requires Windows and macOS machines, which I don't have. :|

[14:52] <AlexDaniel> See https://github.com/rakudo/star/issues/124

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> there are at least 2 volunteer for star

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> and 0 for rakudo :)

[14:53] <AlexDaniel> volunteers*

[14:53] <discord6> <kawaii> ah, hm, no access to a macOS box sadly, Windows can always be done in a VM though

[14:54] <tyil> iirc the manager needed to be able to release for windows, which I don't use (and don't want to use either), so it'd be hard for me to do myself :<

[14:55] <discord6> <kawaii> I think finding someone with access to a mac is going to be the most difficult part

[14:55] <discord6> <kawaii> we're mostly native linux users here it seems

[14:55] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: what about rakudo?

[14:55] <tyil> I know plenty of people who use a mac, but none of them with an interest in Perl 6 

[14:55] <discord6> <kawaii> I am probably not nearly knowledgeable enough to handle Rakudo itself AlexDaniel

[14:56] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: but are you willing to learn? I'll be around next month to help

[14:57] <discord6> <kawaii> sure, of course, as you might have noticed - I use the Raku Discord bridge to chat here, but I check this channel often so it's fairly easy to get hold of me

[14:57] <discord6> <kawaii> I'm simply '@kawaii' on github too, if you need to tag me in anything

[14:57] <discord6> <kawaii> ugh, Discord tried to do things there and probably sent weird things to the IRC

[14:58] <discord6> <kawaii> i'm simply 'kawaii' over there, regardless :]

[14:59] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: ok, you were not in perl6 org, right? I have sent you an invitation

[14:59] <El_Che> linux packages are being built as we speak ( now doing a test run to make sure 2019.03 isn't broken)

[14:59] <discord6> <kawaii> but yes, happy to learn when you have time, I had some experience in similar pursuits packaging postgresql and xen for Debian for a previous employer so, I'm sure I can pick it up

[14:59] <El_Che> AlexDaniel++

[15:00] <discord6> <kawaii> AlexDaniel: accepted the invite, thanks!

[15:00] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: go through this doc to see what needs to be done https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/docs/release_guide.pod

[15:00] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: you will also need to sign a CLA

[15:01] <AlexDaniel> “ https://www.perlfoundation.org/contributor-license-agreement print it out, sign it, scan it in (resize your scan to 250KB or less). Email to trademark -at- perlfoundation.org (please scan and email if you can, it's so much more efficient) ”

[15:01] <discord6> <kawaii> AlexDaniel: I

[15:01] <discord6> <kawaii> will do so today

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: the doc mentions a script that is currently not on github, I'll fix that ASAP, but basically it just does all the steps that described in the doc

[15:02] <AlexDaniel> are described*

[15:03] <AlexDaniel> you need to know how to do it manually anyway

[15:05] <discord6> <kawaii> AlexDaniel: rather large document, and quite complex, so I'll set aside some time this weekend to get to grips with the process :]

[15:05] <discord6> <kawaii> regardless, I'll send that email with document attached within the next few hours

[15:09] *** cpan-p6 left
[15:10] *** cpan-p6 joined
[15:10] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: yeah, CLA is needed to be able to push to the rakudo repo

[15:10] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: somehow it has a different policy than other perl6 repos… but that's ok :)

[15:12] <AlexDaniel> it takes some time for someone to confirm that it was received, so yes, it's better to do it now to make sure you get the required access when the time comes :)

[15:40] <Altai-man_> kawaii, you can try to resize it with `ps2pdf`

[15:41] <Altai-man_> it is part of ghostscripts and usually makes pdf scans smaller quite a bit, while the quality is about the same.

[15:42] <Altai-man_> just `ps2pdf big-file.pdf small.pdf` will do.

[18:15] <Altai-man_> I also have to say that things like installing a bunch of modules with zef is visibilly faster for me now compared to a half of a year ago state. And it is pretty great.

[18:17] <Altai-man_> I wonder why do Pair ~~ Associative, though.

[18:18] <Altai-man_> Intuitively it is, of course, but it is hard to imagine a situation where `$pair<explicit-key-name>` can beat `$pair.value`

[19:06] <discord6> <kawaii> hello! I've made some changes based on the feedback I got yesterday regarding my module, but now running into errors that are a little above my understanding https://gist.github.com/kawaii/c6e1cbbc78ae25a3f21dd2071dbd6fd2

[19:06] <discord6> <kawaii> https://github.com/shuppet/p6-net-rcon/blob/master/lib/Net/RCON.pm6

[19:07] <discord6> <kawaii> {host => localhost, port => 25567} is what gets passed to the IO::Socket::INET.new, is this wrong?

[19:09] <Altai-man_> hmm, that |%arguments should be working. :|

[19:10] <Altai-man_> kawaii, is your module self-contained?

[19:11] <Altai-man_> I likely need to write a little mock server to test it out...

[19:11] <discord6> <kawaii> Altai-man_: yes, and I've updated the gist with a docker command you can use if you need a real RCON server to play with 😉

[19:12] <discord6> <kawaii> I've no idea if the rest of my module works, such as authentication, since I can't yet get past connecting 😄

[19:13] <Altai-man_> well, I cannot promise I can help, but I can try. :)

[19:13] *** zachk left
[19:13] <discord6> <kawaii> much appreciated regardless 😃

[19:15] *** dhyan_nataraj joined
[19:17] <Altai-man_> can be reproduced with just `my $args = {:host("localhost"), :port("25567")}; my $a = IO::Socket::INET.new(|$args);` when dummy server listens. :|

[19:18] *** dhyan_nataraj left
[19:18] *** dhyan_nataraj joined
[19:19] <Altai-man_> oh, I get it

[19:19] <Altai-man_> kawaii, you need to pass port as an Int, not as a Str.

[19:19] <Altai-man_> so `:port('25567')` becomes just `:port(25567)`.

[19:19] <discord6> <kawaii> ohhh right!

[19:20] <Altai-man_> and the error message "Invalid arguments to .new?" is, well, technically correct. :)

[19:21] <discord6> <kawaii> so my new error is 'Could not accept socket connection: Invalid argument'

[19:21] *** sauvin left
[19:21] <discord6> <kawaii> is that because I'm passing in a password at the same time?

[19:22] <Altai-man_> I wouldn't say that.

[19:22] <Altai-man_> let me see...

[19:23] <Altai-man_> isn't it because you are trying to write a client, but `accept` is for server-side?

[19:23] <Altai-man_> as far as I understand it.

[19:23] <discord6> <kawaii> huh, oh, let me re-read the docs

[19:23] <Altai-man_> >In listen/server mode, waits for a new incoming connection. Once a new connection is established, an IO::Socket::INET instance (or a subclass instance) for consuming the connection is returned.

[19:24] <Altai-man_> I don't think it is needed.

[19:25] <discord6> <kawaii> so I should just pass $socket directly into authenticate? 😃

[19:25] <Altai-man_> I hope you'll be fine doing it. :)

[19:26] <discord6> <kawaii> yes, thanks for your help!

[19:26] <Altai-man_> you are welcome!

[19:52] <discord6> <kawaii> so I have this line my $payload = pack("VV", 1, $packet-type) ~ $message ~ pack("xx"); and pack returns a Buf but the ~ stringifys it, causing an error, how else can I concatenate all this? 😃

[19:52] <Altai-man_> .append method?

[19:53] *** guifa left
[19:53] <Altai-man_> though I am not sure how ~ doesn't work with Buf...

[19:53] *** random_yanek left
[19:54] <Altai-man_> m: my $a = Buf.new(1,2,3); my $b = Buf.new(4,5,6); say $a ~ $b; say ($a ~ $b).^name;

[19:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 70d61b214: OUTPUT: «Buf:0x<01 02 03 04 05 06>␤Buf␤»

[19:54] <discord6> <kawaii> the original module does this my $data = pack( "VV", 1, $type ) . $message . pack("xx");

[19:54] <Altai-man_> 1)is your $message a Buf?

[19:55] <discord6> <kawaii> in this case, $message is the password, so it's a string

[19:55] <Altai-man_> you need to convert it to Buf too.

[19:55] <Altai-man_> what encoding do you want, utf-8?

[19:55] <discord6> <kawaii> can I coerce it?

[19:55] <discord6> <kawaii> yes 😃

[19:55] <Altai-man_> what encoding should one use during coercion? :)

[19:56] <Altai-man_> "$message.encode"

[19:56] <Altai-man_> will do, I think.

[19:56] <Altai-man_> m: my $a = Buf.new(1,2,3); my $b = Buf.new(4,5,6); say $a ~ 'foo'.encode ~ $b;

[19:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 70d61b214: OUTPUT: «Buf:0x<01 02 03 66 6F 6F 04 05 06>␤»

[19:56] <discord6> <kawaii> I'll try that!

[19:56] <Altai-man_> utf8 is default for `encode` method.

[19:57] <discord6> <kawaii> hey! that... worked, I didn't get any error and it just returned to my shell

[19:58] <discord6> <kawaii> so I assume I need to add the rest of the logic to see if my auth worked

[19:58] <discord6> <kawaii> thanks again!

[19:58] <Altai-man_> well, you can read some response from the socket, I think, and print it.
