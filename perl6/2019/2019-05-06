[08:40] <ufobat__> timotimo, i dont get what you've written in the brackets

[08:41] <timotimo> well, if you use "but", it will give you a clone that has the new type and keeps the data from the existing object

[08:42] <ufobat__> yeah

[08:42] <timotimo> so when you just grab the existing object back, any changes to the attributes that the clone has done will be lost

[08:42] <ufobat__> ah

[08:44] <ufobat__> mhm maybe it's easier for me to avoid the mixin at all and use a class instead, that has the $value as an attribute.

[08:44] *** zakharyas joined
[08:44] <ufobat__> thanks :)

[08:47] <antoniogamiz> how much time should take zef to install doc dependencies?

[08:49] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, it depends. due to p6c.org being down, you are likely observing a 6 minute delay. you can avoid that by updating zef

[08:49] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: aaahh ok, I'll do that then :)

[08:50] *** cpage joined
[08:50] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, and you can add --/update option, like `zef --/update Foo::Bar` to avoid ecosystem cache update process, which causes a delay

[08:51] <timotimo> yeah, composition is very good

[08:51] <timotimo> mixins are extra useful if you've got to "sneak past" some type checks

[08:51] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: nice! mmm I've rebuilt zef and now it says that cannot find JSON::Tiny

[11:33] <lizmat> https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-ecosystems/blob/master/cpan.json  should be a ~50K lines JSON file: it isn't atm

[11:34] <jmerelo> lizmat: that's why I asked this morning for a redirection of those addresses. I got like 2 dozens emails from Docker Hub also telling me that docker container build are failing

[11:34] <jmerelo> lizmat: Ah, wow. It's empty.

[11:34] <lizmat> yup

[11:34] <jmerelo> lizmat: that's a different problem. CPAN is failing this weekend.

[11:35] <jmerelo> lizmat: Somebody mentioned in Twitter they were doing maintenance operations 

[11:35] <jmerelo> So perl6.org pages are failing, cpan is failing, and we should really, really, do something about the infrastructure.

[11:36] <jmerelo> https://log.perl.org/2019/04/maintenance-week.html

[11:36] <jmerelo> Today is a bank holiday in the UK, although this in in the Netherlands, if I remember correctly.

[11:36] <timotimo> learn perl5? rewrite modules.perl6.org's module updater in perl6?

[11:38] <jmerelo> lizmat: those raisins are the best.

[11:38] <timotimo> "connection timed out"

[11:39] <jmerelo> I think we should try and create a doc mirror in GitHub, simply perl6doc.github.io

[11:39] <jmerelo> At the end of the day, it's all static. Might not be the main site, but could be used to redirect in a pinch.

[11:40] <timotimo> [2019-05-06 11:38:44.74156] [32387] [info] Using ModulesPerl6::DbBuilder::Dist::Source::CPAN to load cpan://id/J/JM/JMERELO/Perl6/Git-Blame-0.0.1.meta

[11:40] <jmerelo> If no one is (strongly) against, it wouldn't be difficult to set up, either from travis or locally when I build it. Main difference would be using my own Github ID or create one ex profeso.

[11:41] <jmerelo> timotimo: er

[11:41] <jmerelo> timotimo: what?

[11:41] <timotimo> yes

[11:41] <jmerelo> timotimo: that is failing?

[11:41] <timotimo> i'm showing that it's in fact working now

[11:41] <jmerelo> ah, OK

[11:42] <timotimo> i already kicked off the update last hour

[11:42] <timotimo> but it didn't pick up your Git::Blame dist

[11:42] <timotimo> lizmat noticed that

[11:42] <jmerelo> then the cpan.json above should be updated in the next sweep. It's activated every two hours.

[11:42] <timotimo> now i fixed the underlying problem

[11:42] <timotimo> where does it grab its data?

[11:43] <jmerelo> timotimo: you've got to dig into ugexe's repos. 

[11:43] <jmerelo> timotimo: right, this is it: https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-App--ecogen

[11:44] <jmerelo> https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-App--ecogen/blob/master/lib/App/ecogen/cpan.pm6 it's taking it from the same place

[11:45] <jmerelo> timotimo: maybe because it was one of the last ones... I upgraded it to 0.0.2 also.

[11:46] <timotimo> that will not work

[11:47] <jmerelo> timotimo: what will not work?

[11:47] <timotimo> ecogen

[11:48] <jmerelo> timotimo: I guess so. Hence the empty cpan.json

[12:01] <jmerelo> timotimo: he's like 6 or 7 hours behind. Not likely.

[12:01] <timotimo> ah, that makes sense

[12:02] <mst> what's breaking? we had some issues wrt PAUSE but if it was already on cpan, it didn't disappear

[12:02] <timotimo> mst: we're using cpan-rsync.perl.org for our stuff; that's not responding to connection attempts

[12:02] <timotimo> http://mirrors.cpan.org/

[12:02] <timotimo> i'm not sure why it's got green on the left and red on the right

[12:03] <timotimo> and what "no time" means

[12:04] <timotimo> probably "tried to find out the exact time the mirror last synced, but failed to do that"

[12:04] * jmerelo goes AFK to cook.

[12:04] <mst> sounds likely

[12:04] <timotimo> and somehow the failure mode wasn't understood to mean "the mirror is actually down completely" or something

[12:05] *** jmerelo left
[12:05] <timotimo> anyway, it was a little foolish of us to use just a single host out of the CPA*N*

[12:05] <mst> aye, though also, better to stress test things now than later when there's more people to be effective

[12:05] <mst> affected even

[12:06] <mst> insufficient coffee error at sentence 1

[12:06] <timotimo> i'm sure there's a clever tool or guide to figuring out what kinds of things an application is trying to reach, and to insert faults at every individual point

[12:06] * timotimo inspired by steven lembark's testing talk

[12:07] <mst> IME that's called 'mondays'

[12:07] <timotimo> huh, there's two videos of that talk? one is about a quarter hour longer compared to the other, but both are on the The Perl Conference youtube channel? uploaded 2 days apart?

[12:08] <timotimo> oh

[12:08] <timotimo> the other one is actually a different talk altogether

[12:08] <timotimo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XREzI5cPOSo - anyway, i liked this talk

[12:10] <timotimo> 80 dists left to process

[12:11] <jdv79> perhaps the pause artifacts should be fixed and used?

[12:12] <timotimo> how do you mean?

[12:12] <timotimo> oh, you mean that if the mirror is down it shouldn't result in an empty list, just in what was there before?

[12:12] <jdv79> iirc pause generates metadata for p6 dists

[13:21] <tyil> there's currently 2 Geths in this channel, do you want me to kill off my instance?

[13:22] <timotimo> what we really should do is get the dns entry fixed so it points to either one of them :D

[13:22] <tyil> oh

[13:22] <tyil> I can't do anything with that :p

[13:22] <timotimo> aye

[13:23] <tyil> I hadn't paid any attention to the hack.p6c server's status, so I was just wondering if mine is still wanted

[13:23] <timotimo> ah

[13:23] <timotimo> i think the other geth runs on a completely different server. nine's if i'm not mistaken?

[13:23] <timotimo> but both geths require changes on github to make the hook point at a different URL

[13:24] <tyil> yeah, the hooks need to point to either one

[13:24] <timotimo> yup

[13:24] <tyil> (or both, if you like spam)

[13:25] <timotimo> until we change the dns and suddenly everything just works again

[13:25] <tyil> I'm not shy on resources right now, so I'll let it run until further notice for now

[13:25] <timotimo> thank you kindly

[13:25] <timotimo> oh, could you also run a synopsebot? :)

[13:26] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/synopsebot

[13:26] <tyil> I guess, if there's a docker image or repo I can look at 

[13:26] <timotimo> no docker yet, but it's at least very simple

[13:26] <tyil> making Docker images of Perl 6 projects is fairly simple

[13:26] <tyil> I have tyil/perl6 as a base which seems to work for everything I'ev tried thus far

[13:27] <timotimo> \o/

[13:29] <timotimo> aye

[13:29] <timotimo> it doesn't even have a database or anything persistent

[13:30] <tyil> well, a TCP connection to the IRC server is better to be persistent

[16:52] <jmerelo> The whole point is you don't need to care about it. I'll set up some commit hooks to generate it automatically every time I do some commit and push it

[16:53] <jmerelo> Anyone else wants to participate, they will just need to install the post-commit hook and re-generate every time they do changes.

[16:56] <Xliff> Does anyone know if there are better examples of nextcallee than what is in the docs?

[17:47] <jmerelo> And generation really takes a long time. We should fix that. Let's see if our two GSoC students can tame that beast...

[17:48] <Xliff> Doc generation should benefit from parallelization. Has anyone tried to make the Makefile work with -j?

[17:48] <jmerelo> Xliff: long time ago we did. We stopped doing it.

[17:49] <jmerelo> Xliff: parallelization is not going to buy you much, anyway, because it's generating 2k files. Every time.

[17:49] *** kaare__ is now known as kaare_

[17:50] <jmerelo> Disk access is going to be sequential anyway

[17:50] <jmerelo> It would help that only what's changed was generated. But that's difficult to do right now, because we don't keep track of that.

[17:51] <jmerelo> Even if we kept track at a file level, it would be big improvement. Right now, there's no way of changing a comma in a Type file and re-generating that file and anything affected by it.

[17:51] <jmerelo> The GSoC projects should take care of that, but there are fundamental problems in the specification of the content, and the file itself.

[17:53] <jmerelo> moritz: it should be updated in docs.perl6.org now

[18:08] *** johnjohn101 joined
[18:09] <raschipi> Sounds good to me. Although generating it automatically wouldn't have solved this problem because Failure wasn't declared is Nil in the docs either until a few days ago. I just didn't update in both places because I didn't find the file until now.

[18:12] <raschipi> I see, getting it from Rakudo itself. That would be nice. It would be easier if it was possible to do the reverse, list everything that extends a certain Type.

[18:13] *** Guest13516 left
[18:13] <raschipi> So one would call Any.^children and go from there.

[18:13] <raschipi> Or rather Mu.^children

[18:14] <jmerelo> Any other way would probably be better than the current one.

[18:19] <jmerelo> raschipi: right. We could do that. We could them blacklist some of them to avoid adding them to the graph, like any NQP stuff.

[18:21] <raschipi> jmerelo: Can I ask you something? I don't remember if I already asked and you said no, so I'm just gonna ask agian. If it bothers you, feel free to ignore my request. I like your reflow commits, but it's difficult to see changes in a diff when you send new content and reflow in the same commit. Could you separate them in multiple commits? Send one with the work you're doing and another one reflowing the text?

[18:21] <jmerelo> sure

[18:21] <raschipi> Thanks

[18:22] * jmerelo reminds himself to do this from now on. It's going to be hard, because I do it as I go...

[18:24] <raschipi> I agree it's difficult, but reading code is done more frequently than writing it, so I think it would save effort in the long run for the project as a whole. Makes it easier to review your commits.

[18:25] <jmerelo> sure, no problem. Thanks for drawing this to my attention.

[18:55] <rba> jmerelo: cool stuff. already thougt about using github pages to host static stuff.

[18:56] <rba> jmerelo: so travis is doing the generation themself?

[18:57] <jmerelo> rba: no for the time being. travis does not do a complete make html. It would take ages to test stuff. 

[18:57] <jmerelo> rba: but I could set up some other pipeline somewhere else. Maybe gitlab.

[18:57] *** skids left
[18:58] <jmerelo> rba: everything would be easy, again, if we had some way of generating only what's needed... 

[18:59] <rba> jmerelo: moritz helped already a lot. so we're currently try to create a list of what all we need. and there might be some more "buiild"-host requirement. (or we use CI/CD service aleady around; just try to get a feeling...)

[18:59] *** traxex left

[19:00] <rba> jmerelo: "generate only what's needed" sounds like a great taks for GSoC...

[19:00] <rba> s/taks/task/

[19:00] <jmerelo> rba: that's what antoniogamiz is supposed to do.

[19:00] <jmerelo> rba: we need to overhaul the whole definition/generation/serving tooling of the documentation.

[19:02] *** vrurg joined
[19:02] <jmerelo> rba: a build host for docs might help, because right now it's using the serving host itself. This causes, by itself, some problems: https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2227

[19:02] <rba> jmerelo: for static pages we look as well if we get some CDN in front of the hosting. this might solve the availablity issues as well...

[19:03] <jmerelo> rba: that will be great.

[19:49] <sena_kun> Cro::LDAP 0.5 is released. (clap clap clap)

[19:49] *** ayerhart left
[19:49] <sena_kun> this is really an alpha release with a good portion of my ugly API, bugs, missing features and so on

[19:50] <sena_kun> but from now on I would like to get some help with detecting what features are needed from now on

[19:50] <sena_kun> so any bug reports, suggestions, feature requests are welcome, https://github.com/Altai-man/cro-ldap <-

[19:50] <sena_kun> cast El_Che 

[19:51] <timotimo> \o/

[19:51] <timotimo> cast summon bigger fish

[19:51] *** ayerhart joined
[19:53] <sena_kun> I really don't know a thing about LDAP(well, _now_ I do, and also now I can encode-decode ASN.1 BER in my mind), so I hope people who have more experience with it will be nice enough to knock me down with bug reports. :)

[19:53] <timotimo> i haven't done any ldap either

[19:53] <timotimo> well, a tiny bit

[19:55] <raschipi> I breath LDAP, but only as an operator.

[19:56] <lizmat> last time I worked on interfacing with an LDAP server, was ~25 years ago

[19:57] <lizmat> and I was not a happy camper, having to interface with a Microsoft implementation of LDAP that didn't follow the official specs (at least at the time)

[19:57] <timotimo> ha

[19:58] <sena_kun> hey, I definetely saw Net::LDAP in "most wanted modules" document! don't tell me now it's useless! :p

[19:58] <raschipi> Which do you guys prefer? LDAP or DNS?

[19:58] <timotimo> DNS kind of doesn't have any authentication, or does it?

[20:01] *** cokebot_ joined
[20:01] <cokebot_> is there a windows alternate to Terminal::ANSIColor ?

[20:01] <raschipi> Well, the authentication services are userDB-independent, as far as I know. It's possible to plug passwd as a backend, LDAP, DNS and others.

[20:01] <timotimo> there's ANSI.SYS

[20:01] <timotimo> i would probably not put my company telephone number database in DNS

[20:02] <cokebot_> looks like ansi.sys isn't 64 bit compatible.

[20:02] <Xliff> .oO( Did timotimo really go old-school with the mention of ANSI.SYS? )

[20:02] <Xliff> God! I haven't thought about that thing in ages!

[20:03] <cokebot_> eh. another reason for me to move this to a browser instead.

[20:03] <timotimo> isn't that how windows users get color in their command.com?

[20:03] <Xliff> Not anymore

[20:03] <timotimo> anyway, there is something on windows that can understand ansi escape codes

[20:04] <sena_kun> >===> Failed to find dependencies: Cro::Core

[20:04] *** cokebot_ left
[20:04] <sena_kun> erm, travis is very unhappy...

[20:04] <Xliff> command.com hasn't been a thing since ... well... Windows 7!

[20:04] <sena_kun> can someone do a test installation?

[20:04] <timotimo> AFAIK on windows if you want color you would open a handle on your current terminal that you're connected to and then in between print calls you would send an out-of-band command to the terminal to activate colors and stuff?

[20:04] <timotimo> Xliff: i know you could still use it on winXP

[20:05] <raschipi> Would the new Windows Terminal solve that problem? They announced it today, showed htop running on it, with colors.

[20:05] <timotimo> it was running inside tmux, even!

[20:05] <raschipi> https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal

[20:06] <timotimo> i mean, the obvious solution would be to get Cygwin/X and xterm

[20:06] <timotimo> :P

[20:06] <raschipi> X.org works in WSL

[20:07] <timotimo> i'm speaking from my experience, which ended rather quickly after windows vista came out

[20:13] <Woodi> sena_kun: re: LDAP: LDAPv3 protocol and StartTLS are important and I can't find it in code

[20:15] <sena_kun> Woodi, what do you mean by `LDAPv3`? I was originally implementing v3, no v2 is planned. As for StartTLS - yes, was on my roadmap for some time and I have some ideas about its implementation, though TLS stuff is often... fun. Can you open a ticket, please?

[20:16] * sena_kun goes afk for 30 minutes~

[20:19] <Woodi> sena_kun: found v3 in encoding.t...

[20:19] <Woodi> will try try ticket :)

[20:20] <sena_kun> Woodi, is v2 really so alive to explicitly mention it? v3 was published in 1997(oh, so we are the same age)

[20:22] *** leah2_ is now known as leah2

[20:26] *** raschipi left
[20:28] <Woodi> sena_kun: no, just v3. I asked becouse didn't see it anywhere.

[20:28] <sena_kun> Woodi, you can add a ticket like "Mention v3 in documentation". ;)

[20:30] <ugexe> all the tests fail like this for me

[20:30] <ugexe> ===SORRY!===

[20:30] <ugexe> Failed to open file /Users/ugexe/.zef/store/cro-ldap.git/1746da2ef5bc9aeb7d3d88894e3fbecee6dd3c01/Cro::LDAP::ASN::Plugin: No such file or directory

[20:31] <sena_kun> ugexe, you need to manually install https://github.com/Altai-man/cro-ldap-asn-plugin for now

[20:32] <sena_kun> probably Cro::LDAP::ASN::Plugin should be published to the ecosystem, since there is nothing deserving "not going to release it right now" status

[20:32] * sena_kun adds it to dependencies...

[20:33] <ugexe> that error still seems odd though

[20:33] <sena_kun> yes

[20:33] <ugexe> why is it trying to open a specific file for instance

[20:33] <Woodi> als can't find definition of Cro::LDAP::Message, where it is defined ?

[20:33] <sena_kun> well, it was not mentioned in "depends" in the first place

[20:33] <ugexe> i would expect 'Could not find Cro::LDAP::ASN::Plugin at line 1 in:'

[20:34] <sena_kun> Woodi, https://github.com/Altai-man/cro-ldap/blob/master/lib/Cro/LDAP/Types.pm6#L5 <- what file spawns the error with Cro::LDAP::Message?

[20:35] <Woodi> sena_kun: yes, just found

[20:36] <ugexe> Cro::LDAP::Test::MockServer is not in the META6.json data

[20:36] <sena_kun> ugexe, ugh, must it be?

[20:37] <Woodi> sena_kun: tickets done :)

[20:38] <ugexe> perl6 -I. t/01-basic.t etc won't work if you dont

[20:38] *** lucasb joined
[20:38] <Woodi> sena_kun: do that repo have client and server implementation ?

[20:39] <sena_kun> ugexe, indeed. I am always using `perl6 -Ilib`, not `perl6 -I.` and it works with the first way.

[20:39] <ugexe> if you want to include a test library that doesnt get installed then put it in t/lib and use `use lib $*PROGRAM.parent.add("lib");

[20:40] <sena_kun> Woodi, no server. Though there is a server stub you can "fill" with whatever implementation you want, but I don't plan to implementing a real ldap server, having a nice client is my main goal.

[20:40] <sena_kun> ugexe, thank you very much! _notes down_

[20:40] <ugexe> ah, the strange Failed to open file error is from ASN::META's runtime module loading, which makes a little more sense

[20:41] <sena_kun> a-a-ah, yes, ASN::META is pretty much... "fun" if you ask me.

[21:28] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: yeah generally nqp changes are reflected in rakudo changelog if there's a good reason to, but I don't see a good reason to release nqp if rakudo prep is not done

[21:29] <AlexDaniel> the wiki page is just a way to let devs to log stuff quickly, the final version should be committed to rakudo repo

[23:52] <timotimo> oh

[23:53] <timotimo> you put another $FixedLine after the .= probably

[23:55] *** cpage_ joined
[23:55] *** cpage left
[23:55] *** cpage_ is now known as cpage

[23:57] <ToddAndMargo> Just one.  First I used "=", then I tried ".=", then I removed the ".".  Jello!

[23:59] <ToddAndMargo> I wonder if th is is an issue with Jeany.  Seems that since upgrading from Fedora 29 to 30, I have to press the save icon several times, even when it is grayed out.  That would explain the jello!

[23:59] <ToddAndMargo> <ctrl><S><ctrl><S><ctrl><S><ctrl><S><ctrl><S>

[23:59] <timotimo> i'm not sure what you mean by that
