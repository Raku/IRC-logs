[01:39] <ugexe> since it could also be a junction of junctions

[03:21] <Kaiepi> Xliff, why aren't you calling $path.destroy before calling $c.fill(:preserve) like in the example?

[03:24] <Xliff> Hmmm.... 

[03:25] <Xliff> Looking.

[03:26] <Xliff> I am thinking that line got nixed because it broke the output in some way.

[03:27] <Xliff> Or... calling destroy on the path caused a SEGV

[03:30] <Xliff> Adding it back doesn't cause a SEGV so I guess that's been fixed since then.

[03:30] <Xliff> Thanks for checking! ;)

[03:30] *** Cabanossi left
[03:36] <Xliff> Kaiepi: Yeah. It was a SEGV. If you uncomment the call to draw_twisted in draw_dream, any call to $path.destroy in draw_twisted will cause a double-free and a SEGV.

[03:37] <Xliff> Uncommenting that line also makes the code run much slower. But it will try to draw the twisted text. Forgot to mention that. *sheepish grin*

[03:38] <Seance[m]> Can anyone exlpain this error to me?

[03:38] <Seance[m]> "Cannot negate % because multiplicative operators are not iffy enough"

[03:39] *** Cabanossi joined
[03:39] <Seance[m]> I wasn't able to google it :|

[03:39] <Xliff> Seance[m]: Can you post some code?

[03:40] <Xliff> Just guessing, but did you try and do something like !($a % $b) ?

[03:40] <Xliff> m: say !(0 % 2)

[03:40] <evalable6> Xliff, rakudo-moar d5044de2f: OUTPUT: «True␤»

[03:40] <Seance[m]> I changed to not test for negativity

[03:40] <Seance[m]> here is the resulting line: 	$i + 2 % 2 ?? @placeholder[i] = operate(@placeholder[i]) !! proceed;

[03:41] <Seance[m]> so i previously had $i + 1 !% 2

[03:41] <Seance[m]> as the condition

[03:41] <Seance[m]> there are other errors in that line I'm sorting too :P

[03:41] <Seance[m]> i.e. precedence for ternary operator

[03:42] <Xliff> m:  !((0 + 1) % 2) ?? 2 !! 1

[03:43] <Xliff> Or: (($i + 1) % 2).so.not

[03:43] <Seance[m]> i was probably jumbling the precedence

[03:44] <Xliff> m: say (5 !% 2)

[03:44] <Seance[m]> i love using ternary operators and just wrecking my code with them

[03:44] <Xliff> Yeah. I think that is better written without the ternary since one condition isn't doing the same as the other.

[03:47] <Xliff> Seance[m]: That is probably better written as: "proceed unless ($i + 2) % 2; @placeholder[$i] = operate(@placeholder[i]);"

[03:47] <Xliff> Errr...

[03:48] <Xliff> proceed unless ($i + 2) % 2; @placeholder[$i] = operate(@placeholder[$i]);

[03:48] <Seance[m]> iirc proceed only works in given/when

[03:48] <Xliff> .oO( Even I forgot the $i! )

[03:48] <Seance[m]> 'proceed without when clause'

[03:50] <AlexDaniel`> Seance: basically, you can only negate operators that return Bool

[03:50] <AlexDaniel`> Seance: and `%` is not one of them, did you mean `%%`?

[03:51] <Xliff> Ah. I keep forgetting that.

[03:51] <Xliff> m: say 5 %% 3; say 5 % 3;

[03:51] <Xliff> Seance[m]: ^^

[03:51] *** araraloren joined
[03:51] <Seance[m]> I was initially using the divisibility operator, then used modulo to work around my error, effectively triggering the exact opposite conditions I was intending

[03:52] <Seance[m]> I thought 0 was false

[03:52] <Seance[m]> and anything else was true

[03:52] *** aborazmeh joined
[03:52] *** aborazmeh left
[03:52] *** aborazmeh joined
[03:52] <Xliff> so your condition would be: ($i + 1) !%% 2

[03:52] <Seance[m]> so if i used modulo and returned 0 it'd be false

[03:52] <Xliff> Yes, but !% does not exist.

[03:52] <Xliff> !%% does

[03:52] <Seance[m]> ahhhhh, I see now

[03:53] <Seance[m]> because modulo isn't boolean

[09:15] <tadzik> patrickb: could be! Maybe I didn't know about it then :)

[09:15] <tadzik> I work with plenty of my old code and always sigh at the sight of File::Slurp these days

[09:16] <tadzik> ooh, it's actually not a core module

[09:16] <tadzik> that explains it :)

[09:16] <tadzik> then yeah, fair enough having it reimplemented there

[09:17] <patrickb> Well it is possible to just copy it hard.

[09:18] <patrickb> Not sure it's worth it though...

[09:19] <patrickb> What's bad about File::Slurp if I may ask?

[09:20] <tyil> is there a way with DB::Pg to execute an SQL file? I'm trying to use $pg.query($file.slurp);, but this gives me an error that I cannot insert multiple commands into a prepared statement :<

[09:20] <patrickb> tadzik: Ah I actually use FIle::Slurper most of the time. That superseded File::Slurp as well.

[09:20] <tyil> (I was able to run a sql file in a similar fashion with DBIish, but iirc DB::Pg was better if you wanted to work with multithreading)

[09:45] *** gng joined
[09:53] <sena_kun> nevack, first write it in long, but easy to understand form ("ungolfed"), and get it working right. once it works, you can make it shorter and shorter ("to golf").

[09:57] <nevack> sena_kun: ok, thanks. Also i need to optimise this, cause it works too long for x = 30, but i need x -> Inf.

[09:58] <patrickb> tadzik: So what do you think would be a good way forward?

[09:59] <patrickb> The basic incompatibility is that I moved the installations to a sub directory. Since all builds up to very recently are not relocatable, it's not possible to just move them over.

[10:36] <fatguy> what is the use case of using submethod TWEAK, looks like i can do all in BUILD ?

[10:43] <lizmat> TWEAK is called *after* the object is already completely built

[10:43] <lizmat> so you can use the normal initialization features and then tweak them to your liking

[10:45] <timotimo> also, having a submethod BUILD will override everything else in that class, like default values for your attributes

[10:49] <fatguy> so looks like the common use case is using TWEAK rather than BUILD ? i still can't think of the use case when to use BUILD and TWEAK, can you help by example or point me to right direction

[10:50] <lizmat> nowadays, using TWEAK is probably the best way to go

[10:51] <fatguy> ok, thanks @lizmat, @timotimo for the advice

[16:59] <notable6> AlexDaniel, Noted!

[16:59] <guifa> Wow

[17:12] <ugexe> couldnt find a nice way to do `"0" and plan(5) or plan(tests => 5);` as single plan ala `plan("0" and ...)`

[17:13] <MasterDuke> heh, finally got a profile by reducing the number of iterations in the benchmark to 20. this is the number of interpreted frames: -0.14% (-25,746)

[17:15] <MasterDuke> huh. reify-until-lazy at SETTING::List:99 had 113k entries, and 112k de-opt ones and 112k OSRs

[17:21] <ugexe> fwiw a more idiomatic perl6 version (use native types) runs in 4.5s instead of 12s https://github.com/ugexe/Perl6-Text--Levenshtein--Damerau/blob/master/lib/Text/Levenshtein/Damerau.pm6

[17:23] <ugexe> but is otherwise the same algorithm

[17:25] <timotimo> i can just plop that at the beginning of the benchmark to compare, yeah?

[17:26] <timotimo> oh, i see MD already put it into the profiler

[17:26] <timotimo> that's an odd result for sure

[17:28] <ugexe> no, i plopped the benchmarking loop into the module noted above and ran it via `perl6 lib/Text/Levenshtein/Damerau.pm6`

[17:28] <ugexe> it doesn't otherwise have the proper full namespace

[17:29] <ugexe> well it might work if you just plop it in there

[17:29] <ugexe> i dunno how it'll work with an existing &dld and importing another &dld

[17:30] <MasterDuke> ugexe: if you're interested in string difference algorithms, have you seen my implementation of Sift4? it runs that benchmark in ~0.3s compared to ~7s for lev-dam

[17:31] <MasterDuke> using your lev-dam from github, not the polyglot versino

[17:33] <ugexe> i think the transposition is what dominates performance (if i remember correctly from implementing the non-damerau variant). but i needed the additional accuracy of transposition scores since i was working with lots of shorter works (mostly names)

[17:35] <MasterDuke> i first came across sift4 because my usecase didn't need the exactness of lev, but did need to be faster

[17:36] <MasterDuke> sift4 obviously makes different tradeoffs

[17:40] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: yeah but that's using nqp ops?

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> and you have to multiply that by 13 if you can't use nqp ops, right?

[17:41] <AlexDaniel> ( https://github.com/MasterDuke17/Text-Diff-Sift4/commit/524f98cdc95c3dc0d982c0ce0782406c61e4a772 )

[21:02] <discord6> <Bearhug> Hey everyone, just learning Perl6. I don't seem to see a difference between Z+ and <<+>> other than the hyper operator generates an Array and Z returns a Seq, is there anything else?

[21:07] <timotimo> yes, Z+ will stop at the shorter sequence when both aren't the same length

[21:07] <timotimo> whereas <<+>> will extend the shorter one by repeating it from the beginning

[21:07] <timotimo> and >>+<< will throw an exception when they aren't the same length

[21:08] <timotimo> on top of that, Z is lazy, i.e. works fine with infinite sequences, but hyper-operators are eager (in fact, hyper is past eager on the lazy-eager scale)

[21:10] <discord6> <Bearhug> I see, very similar but the differences are in the details. Thanks :)
