[03:38] *** Sgeo__ left

[03:38] <hythm> AlexDaniel, I mean since I passed 'a' before :$b, I expect MAIN to accept 'a' before :$b, but instead, the first argument MAIN is looking for is $b 

[03:39] <hythm> it's not the case if it's positional argument

[03:39] <hythm> multi MAIN ( 'a', $b! ) { say 'MAIN'; }; # /tmp/delme.p6 a h; # works since it's positional $b

[07:53] <holyghost> I guess people don't read tests

[08:11] <kawaii> Early morning question since brain is clearly not working... if I have a variable such as `my Int $rolls = x;` why can I not do `for $rolls {}` and have it do the action X times?

[08:14] <holyghost> for 0..^$rolls+1 ?

[08:14] <timotimo> kawaii: because you can have stuff like "for 'bleh' { .say }"

[08:14] <yoleaux> 05:47Z <jmerelo> timotimo: the crontab for modules.perl6.org does not seem to be working. It's triggered correctly, but it does not seem to run

[08:14] <timotimo> holyghost: ..^ is for "up to the number minus one" and you're adding one to the range at the end? why not 1..$rolls instead?

[08:15] <holyghost> fine by me :-)

[08:15] <timotimo> m: my Int $rolls = 3; for ^$rolls { say "hi" }

[08:15] <evalable6> timotimo, rakudo-moar 8a37b9311: OUTPUT: «hi␤hi␤hi␤»

[09:45] <Rayler> Hello people

[09:47] <AlexDaniel> Rayler: hello!

[09:48] <Rayler> Hi Alex, do you know if anyone is working on encoding/decoding in MoarVM, perl6

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> Rayler: oh! That'd be samcv

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> samcv: hello? :)

[09:49] <lizmat> Rayler: what is your question?

[09:49] <Rayler> I downloaded and built Moar VM from source yesterday, and found a few amazing links including the blog post from sam, just wanted to help out

[09:49] <lizmat> samcv has been very busy since she started her new $work earlier this year

[09:49] <Rayler> Wondering where to start

[09:50] <lizmat> well... perhaps leave a .ask for her:

[09:50] <lizmat> I don't think she backlogs #perl6 that much anymore

[09:51] <Rayler> I am actually open to helping out on anything, snce I am just learning. If there are any other projects going on

[09:51] <AlexDaniel> that sounds awesome!

[09:51] *** noisegul left

[10:58] <moritz> Erlangen.pm will likely organize the German Perl Workshop 2020

[10:58] <moritz> and we're looking for suggestions for a name or name + tagline or so

[10:58] <moritz> we want to incorporate the old name, and that it's open for Perl 5 and Perl 6 stuff

[10:59] <moritz> and possibly open to more general software engineering related stuff (like architecture, version control, CI/CD, legal and social aspects etc.)

[11:30] <kawaii> So I spend a lot of my time working on `$open-source-php-forum-software` and we used to have a 'merge' system a while back which was since abandoned due to developer constraints. It seems that users want to be able to convert their forum databases to and from `$other-open-source-php-forum-software` and there aren't any standard tools to do this easily. I had some discussions with a friend and Perl 6 grammars were suggested to me as a potential

[11:30] <kawaii> solution... Does anyone have any thoughts on this? How would it work? Would I define a grammar for each supported $open-source-php-forum-software and then deserialise into a standard shared format/AST?

[11:31] <kawaii> for simplicity sake let's say they're all postgresql databases

[11:32] <kawaii> in fact, could a grammar possibly encapsulate all of the possible data points from an entire forum software schema?

[11:33] <holyghost> I', probably overreacting but you can encapsulate the pg_* methods

[11:33] <holyghost> pg_connect etc IIRC

[11:34] <holyghost> pg_* == postgres MySQL methods

[11:35] <holyghost> s/MySQL/SQL, mysql are another php db backend

[11:39] *** mowcat left
[11:40] <holyghost> I guess one would have to look into a major $other-open-source-php-forum-sftware such as phpBB

[11:40] <holyghost> most fora are derived from this, for starters

[11:40] <kawaii> So my idea is that each software would produce their own grammar which matches their database schema, and I would define a 'universal' grammar which those schemas are serialised into

[11:41] <kawaii> then when it's in the universal format, you would choose a target format (i.e. MyBB, XenForo) to serialise into

[11:42] <kawaii> i.e. `phpbb` -> universal format -> `mybb`

[11:44] <holyghost> FWIW, php syntax for databases is fixed

[19:21] <hythm_> hi, is there a quick way to know the exact  rakudo commit the broke code instead of building the whole thing to test? so far i have built and tested the versions on this comment  https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2933#issuecomment-500983361 

[19:22] *** Black_Ribbon joined
[19:24] <hythm_> i can build the versions in between 2017.07 to 2018.12 and test , but this will take long time

[19:45] <hythm_> yes and it fails during compiling, so i use `rakudobrew build moar master` for now (which is not the same thing, i guess)

[22:04] <patrickb> ping vrurg

[22:05] <vrurg> patrickb: gimme a few mintues.

[22:07] <vrurg> *I'm

[22:07] *** lgtaube joined
[22:08] <patrickb> vrurg: In the rakudo build is there a way to get at the nqp config from within a template? `nqp::*` doesn't seem to work...

[22:08] <patrickb> Specifically I need the nqp prefix

[22:09] *** Black_Ribbon left
[22:09] <vrurg> @nqp::variable@ you mean?

[22:09] <patrickb> or more specifically the NQP home folder, which is `nqp_prefix/share/nqp`

[22:09] <patrickb> Yes

[22:09] <patrickb> but @nqp::prefix@ seems to evaluate to an empty string.

[22:10] <vrurg> That's likely a bug.

[22:11] <patrickb> So that's meant to work?

[22:13] <vrurg> Indeed a bug. It must.

[22:14] * vrurg is working on it.

[22:14] <vrurg> Wait, no, it isn't. 

[22:15] <vrurg> The config is read from a backend nqp, this it is backend dependant and only available withing foreach_backend context.

[22:16] <vrurg> *for_backends

[22:16] <patrickb> Hm. The Makefile templates also mostly belong to a backend, right?

[22:17] <patrickb> So in the moar Makefile I could reach for the moar backend NQP config.

[22:17] <vrurg> moar/Makefile.in, jvm/Makefile.in – yes.

[22:17] <patrickb> is that @moar::stuff@ ?

[22:17] <vrurg> This is where you have them available.

[22:18] <vrurg> @moar::*@ too. It's been read via nqp --show-config anyway.

[22:18] <patrickb> ah! I think I got it. I'll give it a try.

[22:18] <patrickb> Thanks!

[22:19] <vrurg> welcome!

[22:20] <patrickb> It works!

[22:26] <ToddAndMargo> Anyone on newbie duty?  I need one liner help importing a module sub

[22:26] <ToddAndMargo> This works: `perl6 -e 'use lib "/home/linuxutil/p6lib"; use PrintColors :PrintBlue; PrintBlue( "Blue\n" );'`

[22:27] <ToddAndMargo> This does not: `perl6 -I/home/linuxutil -M "PrintColors :PrintBlue" -e 'PrintBlue( "Blue\n" );'`

[22:27] *** rindolf left
[22:27] <ToddAndMargo> What did I do wrong, this time?

[22:28] <ToddAndMargo> oops, but still does nto work: `perl6 -I/home/linuxutil/p6lib -M "PrintColors :PrintBlue" -e 'PrintBlue( "Blue\n" );'`
