[10:23] <jmerelo> perl6.org has been acting up lately.

[10:23] <jmerelo> This morning the domains did not work...

[12:33] <jmerelo> masak: I don't either :-)

[12:35] <masak> I do, a few. I've been known to `git init` a project that I downloaded, just so that I can `git grep` it

[12:37] <jmerelo> masak: :-)

[12:39] <tadzik> :D

[12:40] <timotimo>  i expect searching through a mildly compressed blob of everything that's in the repo but in a single file can be quite efficient

[12:46] <jmerelo> timotimo: git is supposed to be a content-addressable filesystem that poses as a source control system. Thus efficiency.

[12:47] <timotimo> there's no gain if your blob files are just the same files again but with "blob" in front

[12:47] <timotimo> which is why git has packfiles

[14:26] <jkramer> Ahoy

[14:27] <jkramer> Can someone help me understand what's happening here? http://dpaste.com/28MZAPA

[14:28] <jkramer> Somehow the result of the gather is completely different from what I'm take'ing

[14:32] <lucasb> do you want to create 2-elem arrays from the list of words?

[14:34] <jkramer> Also this looks like the loop is iterated again after it was already finished? http://dpaste.com/0X1C3JF

[14:34] <jkramer> lucasb: Well I actually want to do something more complex but I made this poor-man's rotor to illustrate the problem

[14:35] *** sena_kun joined
[14:38] <jkramer> Ahh, looks like I need to clone the stuff I'm taking or it'll return @x itself. Is that intentional?

[14:38] <lucasb> "iterated again after it was already finished"  test('foo bar baz'.words.&test)  <-- called twice, no?

[14:38] <jkramer> Oops yeah true

[14:39] <jkramer> Ok so when I do "take @x" and then modify @x, that also modifies the @x that I've already taking outside the gather?

[14:40] <lucasb> dunno, possibly :) can you try @x<> ?

[14:40] <jkramer> You mean "take @x<>"?

[14:40] <lucasb> yes, the zen slice

[14:41] <jkramer> That returns (["baz"], ["baz"]).Seq

[14:42] <jkramer> This seems weird, I'm relatively sure I've been take'ing arrays like this in the past and had no problems.

[14:44] *** curan left
[14:45] <lucasb> m: sub f(@a) { my @x; gather { for @a { @x.push: $_; take @x[*] } } }; dd f([1,2,3])

[14:46] *** w17t joined
[14:46] <lucasb> jkramer: but yeah, .clone seems to work

[14:55] <guifa> SmokeMachine: barring a more robust testing module (and nailing down exactly how I want to have people call it), it‚Äôs pretty much done

[14:56] <guifa> Well, that and the absence of the two built in functions ‚Äî¬†but I‚Äôm working on those, there‚Äôs just a LOT of work that has to get done first.  I just finished last night a full BCP47 parser

[15:00] <guifa> Who would have thought that ‚Äúen-Shaw-US-t-es-Hebr-ES-u-ca-islamic-x-foo-bar-hahahaha‚Äù is a valid language code?

[15:00] <jnthn> It's just an identifier :P

[15:01] <guifa> (American English, written in the Shaw script, as transformed [translated]¬†from Peninsular Spanish written in Hebrew script that uses the Islamic calendar and has private tags of ‚Äúfoo‚Äù ‚Äúbar‚Äù and ‚Äúhahahaha‚Äù)

[15:02] <guifa> jnthn: I know hahaha, it‚Äôs still a bit insane how detailed the tags were.

[15:02] <discord6> <Rogue> isn't that how you send all your communications?

[15:07] <discord6> <Vendethiel> I installed a module to a specific location with zef ‚Äîto=.perl6 install .... I seem to see the module there. But I have no idea what the incantation is for p6 to pick it up. use lib ‚Äò.perl6‚Äô; doesn‚Äôt work (which makes sense, it wants to be use compunit or w/e).

[15:08] <guifa> Any preferences on naming?  Should the BCP47 module return a class ‚ÄúLocale‚Äù or ‚ÄúLanguageTag‚Äù ?

[15:09] <guifa> LanguageTag makes more sense because of all the extra information they can hold beyond just language/region/script, but in practice many people use Locale (and a lot of other frameworks use that term)

[15:10] <discord6> <Rogue> Well, name it what it ought to be, imo

[15:11] *** zakharyas left
[15:14] <SmokeMachine> Vandethiel: have you tried 6pm?

[15:32] *** zacts joined
[15:33] <discord6> <Vendethiel> SmokeMachine: I'm too scared of my sysadmisn to annoy them yet again :-). I'll try -I first

[15:33] <guifa> For the META6.json file inside of ‚Äúprovides‚Äù do I include a list of each class (all or exported only?) and their associated file?  Or do just the (sub)modules with their filename regardless the number of classes/roles contained within?

[15:34] <discord6> <Vendethiel> sena_kun: seems like -I does the same thing as use lib. Doesn't work.

[15:34] <discord6> <Vendethiel> I'm keeping that 6pm link though, I definitely want to use that later...

[15:35] <sena_kun> guifa, just a "submodule"/file

[15:35] <sena_kun> so if you have A.pm6 and class B, class C, class D there, you only write "A": "A.pm6".

[15:36] *** molaf left
[15:38] <sena_kun> or, rather, `: "lib/A.pm6", but you get the idea, I hope. :)

[15:55] <sena_kun> hmm, that's odd to me, as it works with e.g. locally stored modules(e.g. clonned from github). On the other hand, zef likely precompiles it, so something other might be necessary in order to use the module.

[16:24] <releasable6> jmerelo, Details: https://gist.github.com/b89f1c81d1dbc661a3e4b4ea07c43ad4

[16:25] <discord6> <Vendethiel> I'm not sure it's a zef issue at all. I think it's a perl 6 issue. I just don't know how to tell rakudo where to look for precompilde modules.

[16:27] <jmerelo> That's so a zef issue.

[16:28] <discord6> <Vendethiel> I don't run zef when I run perl6

[16:31] <jmerelo> Yep, but it's intimately related to how zef works. All the CompUnit thing is a bit tangled between zef and Rakudo

[16:32] <jmerelo> In that particular case, you are looking for a CompUnit path. That's not documented, but if I remember correctly the path includes a call to NQP::sha1

[16:32] <jnthn> I think you'd perhaps have to use -Iinst#/the/path if it's an installation repository

[16:32] <jmerelo> At any rate, zef's (and thus rakudo's) advice to that kind of thing is: don't. All details of actual storage places are implementation-dependent and you should not take care of that.

[16:33] <jnthn> Rather than a file system one

[16:34] <jnthn> I think --to=... will assume there's to be an installation repo there, not a filesystem one

[16:34] <jnthn> Whereas -I defaults to a filesystem one

[16:37] <discord6> <Vendethiel> jnthn: I just figured it out... Yup, need inst#

[16:38] <discord6> <Vendethiel> oh note, use lib 'inst#foo'; also works.

[16:39] <discord6> <Vendethiel> jnthn++ ugexe++ # blogpost was helpful too

[16:40] <jmerelo> Which blogpost?

[16:41] <jnthn> I think zef and perl6 are making sensible individual choices on defaults here, but it does mean one has to be aware that there's multiple kinds of repository.

[16:41] <discord6> <Vendethiel> advent of code blogpost

[16:44] <discord6> <Vendethiel> argh. I have deps installed for my own user, so --install-to=... doesn't install them -- they're technically "present"...

[17:52] <guifa> Okay I *think* I have everything uploaded to github for anyone who wants to play around with BCP74

[17:54] <guifa> SmokeMachine: I‚Äôll try to get Fluent added to github sometime tomorrow.  Basically, signature for localization is going to be something similar to 

[17:56] <guifa> sub localize (Str $message-id, LanguageTag $language, *%variables ‚Äî> Str) {¬†‚Ä¶¬†}

[17:57] <guifa> https://github.com/alabamenhu/BCP47

[19:06] <hahainternet> Xliff: very nice

[19:06] <Xliff> The library itself is kinda raw and just barely supported, but if I can get in contact with the upstream maintainer, I'm willing to contribute back to it.

[19:07] <Xliff> I've been waiting for a scriptable spreadsheet for ages.

[19:07] <Xliff> Well.... scriptable with Perl6.

[19:07] *** dominix_ left
[19:07] <Xliff> I still think I may end up making a P6 interface for Google Sheets if someone doesn't get to it.

[19:08] <hahainternet> i wish i had the time to contribute

[19:09] <Xliff> Gist now shows script used to make the screenshot.

[19:11] <Ulti> so this is blocking me from building on macOS, does anyone have some advice "GNU tools detected, despite this not being a GNU-oriented build."

[19:14] <hahainternet> Ulti: i don't know for sure

[19:14] <hahainternet> but did you install coreutils through brew or similar?

[19:14] <hahainternet> the default tools in macos are BSD, but it's common to install the GNU ones

[19:14] <jmerelo> Xliff: you do that!

[19:14] <hahainternet> so i expect you've got 'incorrect' paths set

[19:19] <Xliff> jmerelo: What? Google Sheet iface for P6?

[19:19] <Ulti> hahainternet: yeah I but this was working as recently as yesterday and I've not touched my tooling

[19:19] <jmerelo> Xliff: yay!

[19:19] <Ulti> could be paths

[19:19] <Ulti> *shrug*

[19:19] <Xliff> jmerelo: Possibly. If the muse strikes me.

[19:20] <hahainternet> Ulti: i don't have a mac and haven't for years, see what's in "echo $PATH"

[19:20] <jmerelo> Xliff: if she does not, _I_ might :-)

[19:20] <hahainternet> Ulti: and if it was working a day ago, you can bisect with git

[19:20] <hahainternet> so pick a time you know it worked, check out that version, see if it does :)

[19:20] <Xliff> I'm so involved with GTK stuffs, that might make a nice diversion.

[19:20] <jmerelo> Xliff: no, really, that kind of thing would be really useful. gist might be gone any day...

[19:21] <Xliff> jmerelo; gist will be gone, what?

[19:21] <hahainternet> he means if you commit your code upstream, or make your own libraries, they will persist

[19:21] <hahainternet> i think :)

[19:21] <Xliff> Well, the code exists here:

[19:22] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GTKSheet

[19:22] <Xliff> I need to get a README.md up.

[19:22] <jmerelo> Xliff: it's a service that might or might not be there soon for publishing our stats and whetever.

[19:23] <jmerelo> Xliff++

[19:23] <Ulti> hahainternet: yeah its not the version in git either so its probably something my side

[20:27] <guifa> Bad practice to add coercion types to Str for module classes?

[20:28] <guifa> Or is that an generally accepted use of augment?

[20:28] *** snarkyboojum_ left
[20:31] <lizmat> guifa: augment should be avoided as much as possible

[20:32] <lizmat> it still has various issues, specifically if you're trying to augment something more than once or have nested augments

[20:32] <lizmat> I don't recall the specifics, but if there's another way to do it, you should use that  :-)

[20:33] <guifa> Ha, noted.  I guess it seems weird that we can write classes to define their own coercion methods, but can‚Äôt really defined how things can coerce into them.

[20:34] <guifa> Just going be lots of multi sub/methods for now :-)

[20:35] <lizmat> guifa: yeah, I wonder if we should have a .COERCE method API for that as well

[20:35] *** mowcat joined
[20:36] <guifa> Then again, it could also have the oddity that A defines its own coercion to B, and B also defines a coercion for A into B.  I suppose there would just need to be a tie breaker in that case 

[20:40] <Xliff> Would anyone find P6 bindings for GTKSourceView interesting?

[21:36] <TreyHarris> In starting to package up a module for upload, I noticed that my use of META6.pm6 meant that every time I made any change to my META6, the resulting json's order got shuffled. Is there an easy way to keep it stable so I don't have so many useless diff lines? Digging about the code in META6 didn't show me a 'sort' option or something...

[21:37] <TreyHarris> If there's a standard way to stably order JSON, I don't know it

[21:38] <moritz> have you looked it jq supports that?

[21:40] <TreyHarris> moritz: Looks like it might... I need to remind myself how to use jq as a passthrough, then I should just have to slap `-S` onto it

[21:40] <moritz> jq -S . < yourfile

[21:41] <moritz> works even without the . :D

[21:42] <TreyHarris> heh, yup. thanks--I use jq to extract data into human-readable form a lot more often that to spit out JSON

[21:47] *** matthew[m] is now known as Matthew[m]

[21:47] <Xliff> Is there a limit to the size of a Perl6 enum?

[21:50] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: test it?

[21:50] <Xliff> Yeah... working on that now. :P

[21:59] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: perl6 -I../cairo-p6-paths/lib -I../p6-Pango/lib -I../p6-GtkPlus/lib -e 'use GTK::Compat::KeySyms; say GdkKeySymbols.enums.elems' # 2270

[22:00] <AlexDaniel> Xliff: is it how many millions of values are there?

[22:01] <Xliff> 2270 values in one enum.

[22:01] <AlexDaniel> I'm kidding of course, but 2270 values is of course not a problem

[22:02] <Xliff> https://github.com/Xliff/p6-GtkPlus/blob/master/lib/GTK/Compat/KeySyms.pm6

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> but I do wanna know if there's a limit that you can hit before you run out of memory‚Ä¶

[22:03] <Xliff> What would be the point of such a large enum? If it pushed the limits of memory, it couldn't be used! %)

[22:03] <Xliff> Scripts that use it gotta live somewhere.

[22:04] <AlexDaniel> well, I have a machine with 64G of RAM at home‚Ä¶

[22:05] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: and does it run a terminal just fine?

[22:05] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: not really, no

[22:05] <Xliff> Mine is still 32.

[22:05] <El_Che> oh noes

[22:05] <Xliff> I need $$$ to go to 64. :P

[22:05] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: I'm disappointed by how fast that gets used up for disk cache

[22:05] <Xliff> Although 32G is treating me just fine. No where even close to running out of memory.

[22:06] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it's thrown away as needed, isn't it?

[22:07] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: My VM uses 12G and I have it running all the time.

[22:07] <Xliff> Still have about half the 32G left.

[22:08] <Xliff> AlexDaniel: Oh! Check out my issue on #whateverable. I can't get sake to run a test-bot

[22:09] * Xliff lunch &

[22:30] <rindolf> hi all

[22:30] <rindolf> AlexDaniel: wow, 64 gb

[22:31] <rindolf> and 8 gb on my desktop box

[22:33] <El_Che> rindolf: what do you run on the laptop? Win7 or Linux?

[22:35] <rindolf> El_Che: fedora 29 x64

[22:38] <El_Che> Gnome? Or something lightweight?

[22:38] <El_Che> I have a 11y old small laptop I use sometimes with 2gb ram

[22:38] <El_Che> I run ubuntu with gnome on that

[22:39] <El_Che> but I would probably be annoyed by its speed for everyday stuff

[22:39] <El_Che> (I tried some more lightweight desktop environment, but I couldn't get used to them)

[22:42] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: yes, of course, but if I'm doing some stuff with a lot of data, I don't want to be pulling from the drive

[22:44] *** kerrhau joined
[22:44] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: around 200G would make me happy I think

[22:44] <AlexDaniel> doesn't sound that unrealistic nowadays

[22:46] <El_Che> I was very happy with a 249MB disk not so long ago, you brat :)

[22:47] <AlexDaniel> or maybe very large and crazy fast SSDs will make me equally happy

[22:47] <El_Che> why choose!
