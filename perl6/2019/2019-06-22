[00:02] <vrurg> timotimo: could you have a look at strangeness on perl-dev? Perhaps you would tell me if that's ok.

[00:03] <timotimo> emails?

[00:03] <timotimo> oh, no, irc?

[00:03] <timotimo> yeah i'm not sure what happened there

[00:04] <vrurg> irc, aha. :)

[00:04] <timotimo> i mean, scalar doesn't immediately mean writable

[00:05] <vrurg> m: module F { our &t; say &t.VAR.^name; }; import F

[00:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed3db12c7: OUTPUT: ¬´Scalar‚ê§¬ª

[00:05] <vrurg> That's definitely not how I'd expect it to be. :)

[00:05] <vrurg> m: my &f; say &f.VAR.^name

[00:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed3db12c7: OUTPUT: ¬´Scalar‚ê§¬ª

[00:07] <timotimo> wait, why?

[00:09] <vrurg> m: my %h; say %h.VAR.^name

[00:09] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed3db12c7: OUTPUT: ¬´Hash‚ê§¬ª

[00:09] <vrurg> Perhaps because of this ^

[00:10] <timotimo> m: my &f; &f = &say; &f = &note; f("hi")

[00:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar ed3db12c7: OUTPUT: ¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[00:10] <timotimo> without a container, this wouldn't work

[00:10] <timotimo> it'd require binding instead

[00:11] <timotimo> OTOH, with Hash being the var, %foo = 1, 2, 3, 4 will turn that list into a hash

[00:11] <vrurg> Makes sense. 

[00:11] <timotimo> so that's what that is, i guess

[00:13] <vrurg> Ok, then I shall check for $ and & sigils when decont an import. Or find out why what gets re-exported via EXPORT ends up wrapped into Scalars unconditionally.

[00:15] <vrurg> Thanks timotimo , I needed some refreshment for my brains. :)

[00:16] <timotimo> reminds me that i should fill up the water filter for some fresh drinkage

[00:19] <vrurg> reminds me that I need to add a line about SetHash assignment into ChangeLog... :D

[01:50] <sitbk> I've got plenty of references for writing P6. Any recommendations for understanding the backend stuff? Trying to better understand the concepts of using MoarVM, JVM, etc. How it all comes together.

[01:52] <vrurg> sitbk: Not much on this topic around. You could start with this: https://github.com/edumentab/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course

[01:53] <vrurg> Then there're some blog posts when you google for them. But mostly it is all about sources.

[01:53] <sitbk> It's a start. I just get confused as I see the terms tossed around.

[01:54] <sitbk> My limited scripting experience deals w/ python & bash, never really saw those kinds of topics. Anyways, much appreciated vrurg.

[01:55] <vrurg> sitbk: welcome! How much of the language itself do you know?

[01:55] <sitbk> Very little. I'm just getting started, going through the Think Perl6 book. 

[01:56] <vrurg> So, stick to it first. Or you might get quite a mess in your head. :)

[01:57] <sitbk> Will do. I tend to jump down rabbit holes whenever a topic comes up. 

[01:58] <vrurg> Best if you do a project when complete the book. This would let you settle down the all your knowledge. 

[01:58] <vrurg> Oh, me is like you. I know what you're talking about. :)

[02:00] *** molaf left
[02:00] <sitbk> I've got some goals in mind. I was torn between this and Python, but I like a challenge. P6 being in it's earlier stages doesn't have as many modules readily available so I'll be forced to do some stuff the hard way. (Yes, I know of the ability to import python and P5 modules, trying to avoid)

[02:02] <vrurg> Good luck and welcome then! :)

[02:03] <sitbk> I appreciate it. I have enjoyed P6's multiple ways of doing things. Sometimes it makes the book a little convoluted, but I like the single line if / then/ unless loops.

[08:10] <releasable6> El_Che, Details: https://gist.github.com/252da40d661f1f4327f19e1dd473d3a7

[08:11] <El_Che> Are the new tarballs release on the same URL as before the server died? If not, I need to change my build scripts. I haven't heard about changed urls though

[08:15] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: haa

[08:17] *** abraxxa joined
[08:17] <AlexDaniel> rba: ping

[08:18] <AlexDaniel> I don't think we have any tarball storage currently?

[08:18] <AlexDaniel> do we need it?

[08:18] <AlexDaniel> because, well, github?

[08:18] *** sena_kun joined
[08:20] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: by any chance do you know what's the point of tarballs?

[08:21] *** abraxxa left
[08:21] *** Itaipu_ joined
[08:22] <El_Che> because originally when I started packaging, the tarballs had some magic sause

[08:22] <El_Che> dunno how it is nowadays, I don't mind whatever release method is used as long as it's reproducible

[08:22] <El_Che> (aka scriptable)

[08:23] <El_Che> I think "github releases" is a good way

[08:23] <El_Che> as it combines tagging and unchangeable files

[08:23] <AlexDaniel> IMO having separate tarballs is just another point of failure

[08:24] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: so you can start changing your script to fetch things from github :)

[08:24] <AlexDaniel> perhaps it's as easy as changing the url to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/archive/2019.03.1.tar.gz or so

[08:25] <Guest71174> :2[1,1,1]  # result 7  ( sets first 3 plases  in base 2);  :10[1,1,1] result 110( sets first 3 places in base 10)             but   :2[10,20,30] is 110 ???  

[08:26] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: you're verifying the gpg key, right?

[08:27] <AlexDaniel> hmmm how to do that on github‚Ä¶

[08:28] <Guest71174> :2[1,1,1]  # result 7  ( sets first 3 plases  in base 2);  :10[1,1,1] result 110( sets first 3 places in base 10)             but   :2[10,20,30] is 110 ???  

[08:31] <AlexDaniel> OK, maybe github releases is not a great way

[08:32] *** SJM_UK left
[08:34] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: so it seems like it's not possible to check the gpg signature when you download a tar from github. Moreover, tar is nondeterministic, so you'll be getting a slightly different archive every time‚Ä¶

[08:34] <AlexDaniel> well, not every time, but sometimes

[08:35] <AlexDaniel> so in the end we'd need to attach a tarball anyway, and then you'll have two download buttons that will give you approximately the same thing‚Ä¶

[08:37] <AlexDaniel> hah, somebody wrote this https://wiki.debian.org/Creating%20signed%20GitHub%20releases

[08:37] <AlexDaniel> good try, but no‚Ä¶

[08:38] <rba> AlexDaniel: ping back

[08:39] *** nadim_ joined
[08:40] <AlexDaniel> rba: so you see, we had a place for tarballs ( https://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo and https://rakudo.org/downloads/nqp I think)

[08:40] <AlexDaniel> rba: which is no longer there, so question is how should we serve the tarballs if at all

[08:40] <AlexDaniel> rba: github already provides this: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/tag/2019.03.1

[08:41] <AlexDaniel> but there's no signature, so no way to check if that tarball is actually legit

[08:42] <AlexDaniel> moreover these tarballs change over time (though the contents remain the same), as witnessed by many projects: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/issues/5151

[08:42] <AlexDaniel> whoever wrote that debian page has no idea

[08:43] <rba> AlexDaniel: AFAIK the tarballs are the source at the time of the tag/release and not a builded source tarbal.

[08:44] <AlexDaniel> rba: sorta, and?

[08:47] <rba> AlexDaniel: github -> build -> release. so there is build step in between. This is what makes an release at the end. At least that's what I thought.

[08:48] <rba> AlexDaniel: Releases on the githup page are jetzt the point in time of the github repo, yet before the build step.

[08:48] <rba> s/jetzt/just/

[08:50] <rba> AlexDaniel: Yet, as far as I understood, we need to define where we make available new release tar balls. And then point the download pages to this place.

[08:51] <AlexDaniel> rba: I'll diff the differences‚Ä¶

[08:51] <rba> AlexDaniel: Or after the build we upload the files side-by-side to the release in github, eg. https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases/tag/2019.03.1

[08:52] <AlexDaniel> fwiw I have all rakudo tarballs starting from 2014

[08:52] <AlexDaniel> nqp since 2012 and moar since 2014

[08:53] <AlexDaniel> I don't have the signatures for them, though

[08:56] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I don't care one way or the other, as long there is an secure and "official" way

[08:57] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: I build a zillion of stuff, and checking keys is mostly part of the process

[08:57] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: however, when I started packing rakudo we didn't even had TLS :(

[08:57] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: so I am flexible, and if the release manger need opinions, I have them too :)

[08:58] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: about everything according to my wife, but that's an other discussion :)

[09:00] <rba> Just to make the history from the broken server available there are currently three places for the old releases: https://perlgeek.de/static/p6/ (moritz) https://files.p6c.dev/ (me) https://rakudostar.com/files/ (think it's form brian d foy)

[09:01] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: we could add a travis config to rakudo, moarvm and nqp to auto create releases and a checksum on a specific form of tag, (like v2019.07)

[09:02] <AlexDaniel> rba: prerelease one you can delete, it's a moving target and it changes all the time

[09:03] <AlexDaniel> rba: but that's awesome, yeah

[09:03] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: auto create releases‚Ä¶ doesn't make much sense to me :)

[09:04] <AlexDaniel> although maybe it's a good idea, I don't know

[09:05] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: simple question though: people want to download a .tar.gz file, a signature, and check that file against the signature

[09:05] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: how to do that?

[09:05] *** SJM_UK joined
[09:05] <AlexDaniel> with github, it means I should attach another tarball with a sig to the release?

[09:06] <AlexDaniel> and that's the plan?

[09:06] <AlexDaniel> so the user will still have  `Source code (zip)` `Source code (tar.gz)` buttons

[09:06] <El_Che> 1. you tag a release with v2019.07

[09:06] *** cpan-p6 left
[09:07] <El_Che> 2. travis picks up the tag by matching it with a regex /^v\d+\./

[09:07] *** cpan-p6 joined
[09:07] *** cpan-p6 left
[09:07] *** cpan-p6 joined
[09:08] <El_Che> 3. travis clones the repo, creates a tar.gz and creates a checksum and uploads it to github

[09:08] <El_Che> (or signs it, need to check that)

[09:08] <El_Che> regular users don't care about the releases

[09:08] <El_Che> the will download binaries elsewhere

[09:09] <El_Che> packages will have to option to work with git tags or github releases

[09:09] <El_Che> the releases can be some sort or archive

[09:10] *** SJM_UK left
[09:10] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äúregular users don't care about the releases‚Äù so we don't need tarballs at all? Those who need this stuff will just keep up with the git repo, no?

[09:12] <El_Che> brb (not at home)

[09:12] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: it's a possibility as long as the tags are standarized

[09:12] <El_Che> bbl

[09:12] *** SJM_UK joined
[09:13] <AlexDaniel> so the difference between release tarballs and the source code is that release tarballs miss some dot files like .circleci, .github, .gitignore, .travis.yml

[09:13] <AlexDaniel> then the release tarball has a weird MANIFEST file and roast in spec/

[09:13] <AlexDaniel> that's about it

[09:13] <rba> I think we still need the release tar balls. This is what's is officialy released. Then this could be used to make packages or containers.

[09:16] <sjm_uk> Hi all - just passing and noticed the chat about installing P6 - do you want any feedback from a user perspective? I have recently required to install P6 to run an app that one of my colleagues developed. 

[09:18] <AlexDaniel> sjm_uk: yes, although if you already identified some issues maybe it's better to create a ticket (or tickets) here https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/

[09:18] <cpan-p6> New module released to CPAN! RPi::Device::SMBus (0.0.4) by 03JSTOWE

[09:20] <sjm_uk> Not sure if tickets will help just yet as there is nothing precise to say. My feedback is not relating to bugs as such, more about the user expectation and process to get to the point of running Perl6 

[09:21] <sjm_uk> packaging essentially

[09:21] <AlexDaniel> sjm_uk: well, there's also https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/

[09:25] <AlexDaniel> sjm_uk: maybe create a ticket first? Not sure what a PR will do‚Ä¶

[09:27] <sjm_uk> No probs - will work that out. The author of the repo looks to be addressing the problems that I have encountered and it could well develop in to the level of documentation needed to remove some of the bumps that I have found.

[13:56] <moritz> Hi all

[13:56] <moritz> I just nuked my rakudo installation, and run perl Configure.pl --gen-moar

[13:56] <moritz> and the nqp build fails

[13:57] <sena_kun> git submodule update, maybe?

[13:57] <moritz> ... and the backtrace is too long for the pastebin, sigh

[13:57] <moritz> moritz@notebook-mlenz:~/p6/rakudo/nqp$ git submodule update

[13:57] <moritz> Submodule path '3rdparty/nqp-configure': checked out '7411804dffa8d63c87956cc764727111537cd865'

[13:59] <sena_kun> \o/

[13:59] <sena_kun> there were changes lately in this area and I just saw how people had issues and the solution was "git submodule update". :)

[14:00] <moritz> thanks

[14:00] * moritz so out of touch these days

[14:03] <timotimo> that's exactly the kind of thing we built p6lerts for :|

[14:13] <AlexDaniel> a lot of things are built without keeping in mind how they're going to be maintained in the future

[14:13] <timotimo> actually we don't need to have a server to run our irc bots either

[14:14] <timotimo> we just max out the time limit on appveyor of 1 hour and just keep retriggering CI builds over and over

[19:28] <xinming_> In this case, the first `my $x := %t<x>` works fine, Since it's alias to a "scalar"

[19:28] <xinming_> the latter  $a doesn't,   Is there a version which I can use to make $a = 4 also work?

[19:29] <xinming_> I think the reason for this is, the %t<a b>   builds a list, and list item can't be assigned.

[19:29] <xinming_> Is there a shortcut to make this work as spected?
