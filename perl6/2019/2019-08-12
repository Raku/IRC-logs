[00:00] <timotimo> there's also ZEF_PLUGIN_DEBUG you can set in the environment, no clue if that'll be very helpful

[00:02] <muse> verbose had this line ==> Found: GTK::Simple:ver<0.1.11> [via Zef::Repository::Ecosystems<p6c>]

[00:02] *** reportable6 joined
[00:03] <irced> muse: i suspect zef is trying to install to an unwritable location

[00:03] <muse> oh hmm

[00:03] <irced> muse: perhaps your perl distro is installed on a part of your drive to which users cannot write

[00:03] <timotimo> zef has a --into flag, doesn't it?

[00:04] <timotimo> it's --install-to

[00:04] <irced> err, rakudo distro that is

[00:04] <timotimo> you can try if giving a definitely-working path makes that work

[00:05] <irced> my modules are installed to .../rakudo/share/perl6...

[00:05] <irced> though i can't speak to all the directories under rakudo/ that zef writes to atm

[00:06] <muse> perl6 -v is giving me a headache.  i think my files are in c:\rakudo\...

[00:07] <muse> which has attribute of read only !

[00:07] <irced> well some of those subdirectories will need to be writable. maybe share?

[00:07] <irced> maybe even rakudo itself

[00:08] <muse> i just made everything writable and it's working

[00:08] <irced> or you can follow timotimo suggestion to specify a different directory though that might warrant creating an environment variable to load to modules correctly

[00:08] <irced> thought so

[00:09] <muse> nevermind its stiill giving the same error T_T

[00:09] <irced> make sure the subdirectories are writable

[00:10] <irced> or maybe zef's install-to keeps track of meta data i dunno

[00:10] <irced> alternatively, see if rakudo can be installed as a user instead of admin. not sure myself been awhile since i installed it on windows. directions may be at the website.

[00:12] <timotimo> i haven't used rakudo on windows yet

[00:12] <irced> after trying to make rakudo recursively writable

[00:12] <timotimo> if you're on windows 10, you can get it to work on WSL

[00:12] <Elronnd> I would use the native windows version

[00:12] <Elronnd> (from wsl)

[00:13] <irced> muse: timotimo suggested debug flags to zef that may reveal more about paths to which it is trying to fetch

[00:13] <irced> muse: which i still believe is the most likely scenario for a "failed to fetch" error, ruling out connectivity

[00:15] *** cpan-p6 left
[00:15] <timotimo> does that even work?

[00:16] <muse> ===> Found: GTK::Simple:ver<0.1.11> [via Zef::Repository::Ecosystems<p6c>]

[00:16] <cpan-p6> New module released to CPAN! OEIS (1.0.1) by 03TOBS

[00:17] <netrino> I just tried to install GTK::Simple on a windows machine, the rakudo is located at the same place "C:\rakudo" and i didn't change anything with regards to writability. It installed successfully, maybe the problem is somewhere else?

[00:17] <irced> netrino: maybe you are logged in as admin?

[00:17] <timotimo> maybe it's time to release GTK::Simple on cpan

[00:17] <timotimo> then it doesn't have to use git to get it

[00:17] <muse> netrino did it fail?

[00:17] <netrino> irced: i didn't start the shell as admin, no

[00:18] <muse> oh nm im dumb

[00:18] <muse> im using powershell does that matter?

[00:18] <irced> muse: very possibly

[00:18] <netrino> muse: i'm using that too

[00:18] <irced> powershell policies could be interfering

[00:19] <irced> maybe even powershell environment variables

[00:19] <muse> ok back to cmd.exe

[00:19] <netrino> i think policies usually restrict script execution, not file access

[00:20] <netrino> at laest i'm not aware of those, tbh i don't really know powershell internals

[00:20] <irced> netrino: point taken but maybe the powershell profile is nonstandard

[00:20] <irced> netrino: in which case even if it's not a policy issue it could be an environment issue

[00:21] <timotimo> this windows thing sounds really difficult

[00:21] <timotimo> i wonder if they ever get to become an end-user desktop operating system

[00:21] <muse> cmd.exe didn't help

[00:22] <irced> well i am just trying to rule out a "profile" issue

[00:22] <irced> muse: and you have confirmed git is in the executable search path?

[00:22] <muse> yes if i type git it gives me a bunch of instructions

[00:22] <irced> what version of zef?

[00:22] <timotimo> we even tried "perl6 -e 'run <git help>'" and got output

[00:23] <timotimo> 0.7.1

[00:24] <irced> muse: you might try to run cmd/powershell as administrator to see if it has an effect

[00:24] <irced> muse: that way privilege issues may possibly be ruled out

[00:24] <irced> that's an older version of zef incidentally

[00:24] <netrino> Wow, i just tried to run in repl some commands from examples and it does work, so simple! Wasn't aware of GTK::Simple and that gtk would be so effortless to use on Windows.

[00:25] <timotimo> probably came with the rakudo star version in question?

[00:25] <irced> netrino: cool

[00:25] <muse> my git is super old its 1.9.5.msysgit.0

[00:25] <timotimo> netrino: \o/

[00:25] <muse> u making me jealous T_T

[00:25] <irced> muse: that is another issue. also, try to use the flag --dry to zef

[00:25] <netrino> muse: :D sorry

[00:26] <irced> muse: zef --dry install GTK::Simple

[00:26] <irced> muse: but very likely git is not parsing because it's outdated. major version is -1

[00:26] <irced> muse: now that you mention it

[00:26] <netrino> muse: try to go to your $HOME/.zef\store\gtk-simple.git

[00:27] <timotimo> are you sure git made non-backwards-compatible changes?

[00:27] <irced> muse: of course, as timotimo suggested, you can look at debug output from zef

[00:27] <irced> considering it's one major version behind, it can't be ruled out

[00:27] <netrino> muse: there should be some directory with obsure name, enter it and try to do git fetch or something

[00:28] <muse> https://pastebin.com/ckdkdzVC

[00:28] <irced> zef may be passing some command line arguments to git maybe even shortcuts or some arguments have been deprecated possibly and replaced with more natural options

[00:28] <irced> which zef could conceivably be passing to it

[00:29] <irced> see, zef is failing with Zef::Service::Shell::git+

[00:29] <irced> which implies the shell is exiting with an error code because git did not parse

[00:29] <timotimo> i kind of wish it would pass on the output with some flag

[00:29] <netrino> muse: btw, did you try to run it with --force-fetch?

[00:29] <muse> yup

[00:30] <timotimo> it'll just fail the next step when all the files are missing

[00:30] <netrino> :(

[00:30] *** aborazmeh left
[00:30] <irced> muse: zef --dry install GTK::Simple ?

[00:30] <irced> muse: anyway, at least get git up to the last major version 2

[00:31] <netrino> https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2486 there is also this issue, doesn't seem to be resolved though

[00:31] <timotimo> you could try getting Github For Windows which should come with an up-to-date git for windows

[00:31] <muse> k

[00:31] <irced> or as timotimo suggested pass some debug flags to zef to see if you can get more information

[00:32] <timotimo> already tried

[00:32] <timotimo> it didn't give much more info

[00:32] <irced> k

[00:33] <muse> lol so many options on git

[00:33] <muse> am happy its integrated with vim tho

[00:34] <irced> anyway, i'm thinking rakudo and zef probably utilize the home directory so that the write privilege issue is now moot. so, if netrino can confirm a git major version 2, we can compare oranges to oranges

[00:34] <timotimo> oh yeah, fugitive is pretty cool

[00:34] <netrino> I do have git v2

[00:34] <timotimo> using git clone to get the repo manually, then cd-ing in to "zef install ." will be a workaround for the time being

[00:35] <irced> muse: you may as well do that, and it will also help isolate the issue a bit

[00:35] <muse> do i use git bash or cmd.exe

[00:36] <irced> shouldn't matter, you're just cloning

[00:37] <muse> building atm

[00:42] <muse> thx everyone for helping me

[00:42] * irced pats timotimo on the back.

[00:56] <irced> anyway, assuming it's not a git parsing thing, maybe muse was in git bash which had the git executable in the path whereas maybe in cmd and or powershell git was not in the search path ?

[00:56] <irced> in which case run or shell from perl6 might not have seen it

[00:57] <muse> no i was in windows powershell and cmd.exe and both let me run git

[00:57] <irced> ok

[00:57] <irced> thanks for letting me know 😃

[18:08] <harmil> Between the unicode spec and what I'm reading of NQPRegex, it seems like <:Property<Y>> should be a synonym for <:Property>, but that's not the case. Is there a well-documented interface between the Unicode spec and the implementation in Rakudo/NQP?

[21:00] <lembark> Q: Anyone hae a good, complete example of using a promise? Say I have to open a file for output, fork gzip, bind-stdin. A chained promise to open the file and start gzip seems like an appropriate way to do this, but the doc examples don't realy show to do anything that takes more than one step.

[21:00] <lembark> Thanks

[21:06] <timotimo> personally, i'd put all that code in just a single "start" block

[21:32] <gdonald> When I'm using a grammar to parse a string with newlines, is there already a way to know which line I'm on?

[21:55] <phogg> Is there some easy way to get all of the perl6 docs a single downloadable file (PDF, HTML, whatever)?

[21:56] <timotimo> https://doc.perl6.org/perl6.xhtml - i think you can download this file

[21:56] <timotimo> it currently has the wrong content type though?

[21:57] <timotimo> actually, no

[21:57] <timotimo> that's not it at all

[21:57] <timotimo> there used to be something, but we've just recently moved servers

[21:57] <phogg> I was going to feel real dumb if it turned out to be that obvious.

[21:58] <SmokeMachine> jnthn: just curious: why ofun isn’t a real contender?

[21:59] <tobs> phogg: this is it: https://docs.perl6.org/perl6.html

[22:00] <timotimo> damn it

[22:00] <timotimo> i was so close

[22:00] <tobs> second sentence on docs.perl6.org :)

[22:00] <timotimo> there is a link to that there?

[22:01] <phogg> tobs: d'oh, staring me right in the face

[22:01] <phogg> I knew this couldn't be that weird of a want.

[22:01] <tobs> yeah, but I only *didn't* skip it because I knew that what I was looking for was actually somewhere obvious for once

[22:01] <phogg> tobs, timotimo: thanks to you both.

[22:02] *** netrino left
[22:02] <timotimo> i was about to ask if someone maybe wants to put a link to that somewhere obvious

[22:05] <phogg> You don't really appreciate the work that has gone in to the docs until you're staring at a 4 meg HTML file. It just goes on forever.

[22:05] <discord6> <Aearnus> perhaps someone should try to hoist the docs into an offline viewer like https://zealdocs.org/

[22:10] <tobs> Aernus: the p6doc module does that, I believe

[22:13] <discord6> <Aearnus> sweet 😄

[22:16] <tobs> (and to clarify "[information] was actually somewhere obvious for once" I meant relative to the internet at large. I love perl6/doc)

[22:47] <tbrowder> folks, i said i would ask damian conway his opinion of empty values for pod configuration keys.  he kindly gave me a detailed answer which i will place in the docs somewhere, most likely in the rakudo repo. i put his response for now in this public gist: https://gist.github.com/tbrowder/dd9bf5cdf217b1168205bbef6c4a51b0

[22:48] <tobs> tbrowder++

[22:51] <tbrowder> damian is a real gentleman, and one of the kindest, and smartest, of living people i know of (which includes donald knuth); they are two of my favorite scientists

[22:52] <tbrowder> i add larry wall as the third in that group, with the same attributes

[22:53] <tbrowder> as a friend of mine would describe them, they all have "servant hearts"

[22:54] <tbrowder> or "hearts for service"
