[00:44] <elcaro> Issue #2975 raised for the above regression

[00:55] *** Sgeo__ joined
[00:56] <olongjohnson> I can pull file access / modified times with the IO class. Is there any way to retrieve creation times?

[01:04] <elcaro> olongjohnson: unix doesn't have a concept of creation time for files

[01:04] <elcaro> as for windows, I know it does tell you creation time in the file props... thought i'm not sure where that info is stored

[01:04] <elcaro> I don't to much development on windows

[01:04] *** [particle]1 left
[01:07] <elcaro> correction: some googling has advised me some unix filesystems do keep track of creation time.. so it depends on what FS you use, and again, there's probably no built-in that will "just work"

[01:09] <olongjohnson> That's kind of what I figured. I do work more on NTFS & EXT4 file systems which should have it available somewhere. For instance, you can grab file creation times with Windows' native PowerShell.

[01:16] <ugexe> use nqp; say nqp::stat("myfile.txt", nqp::const::STAT_CREATETIME)

[01:20] <ugexe> looks like there are a few from the ops list you can add -- https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown#stat

[01:22] *** [particle]1 left

[01:23] <olongjohnson> Much apprciated

[01:26] <elcaro> ugexe: yeah, at the time I made it, I was just satisfying a need for someone who needed access to unix stat values

[01:26] <elcaro> but I do wanna expand it to also wrap around nqp::lstat, as well as add the other consts

[07:23] <jmerelo> holyghost: it compiles. That's something.

[07:24] <holyghost> jmerelo : I use "use-ok" for every module in t/00-load.t

[07:24] <jmerelo> holyghost: you might want to eliminate use before use_ok, though. If use is not ok, you will not be able to use them.

[07:34] <holyghost> Later on JJ, I'm going to work on p6-Bayes-Learn, it needs several things still then if lizmat wants to sh better writes something about Game::Bayes instead of the simplicity in Game::Stats

[07:35] <holyghost> It needs a small text based game in tests

[07:35] <holyghost> e.g. by elevating with a physics engine, I don't know yet

[07:36] <holyghost> then running RPG systems in the tests on it, the physics for when enemies collide etc

[07:36] <holyghost> It's probably gonna be a huge test system

[07:37] <holyghost> Just saying

[07:37] <holyghost> s/p6-Bayes-Learn/p6-Game-Bayes

[07:38] <holyghost> s/test/test and example/

[07:40] <holyghost> Game::Stats is made for Hidden Markov Models and Game::Bayes e.g. for Age of Empires 3

[07:41] <holyghost> ^-- this is the Good Thing about it

[07:46] <holyghost> Life is Good :-)

[07:50] <holyghost> jmerelo : if it's finished, is there someone who's going to publish it ro does it just stay on github ?

[07:51] <holyghost> s/ro/or

[07:53] *** aborazmeh left
[07:57] <jmerelo> holyghost: leave it in GitHub until it's stable and everything has been ironed out. People can still use it from GitHub

[07:59] <holyghost> Game::Stats is a very simple package to understand and you cannot just make statitics tests then calculating just a function from it

[10:51] <holyghost> OTOH I was talking to my AI/Adaptive Systems/DB/Programming profs, it seems I can write a game of tabletop "Risk" with Game::Bayes, I'll try to make it an examples dir for that next week

[10:52] <holyghost> risk-o-matic in the tests and a non-curses (non-ncurses) GUI which prints the rectangles of neighbouring Risk table regions

[10:53] <holyghost> with army size in them

[10:53] <holyghost> I'll start on Mars :-)

[10:55] <holyghost> I would also like to do an M$ "Age of Empires (3)" game with it using NCurses module, again later on

[10:55] <holyghost> NCurses for such as nethack graphics

[13:53] <patrickb> Even when I'm on node?

[13:54] <pmurias> patrickb: rakudo.js is not node only

[13:54] <patrickb> But when I'm in a browser there can't be any node modules, right?

[13:55] <moritz> pmurias: if you write a use Thing :from<...>; you're in Perl 6, not (necessarily) node

[13:55] <moritz> erm, meant patrickb 

[13:55] <pmurias> patrickb: node modules can be used in the browser by a bundler (webpack or parcel)

[13:56] <patrickb> And those are different from other stuff I might load in a browser...

[13:57] <pmurias> patrickb: what I mean is that it should be possible to bundle your Perl 6 script together with node.js modules and run it in the browser

[14:03] <pmurias> patrickb: and I suspect there is value for things that aren't valid in the place where you are running stuff in to have a different :from<...> so that they are cleanly detected as impossible

[14:04] <patrickb> Got it. Thanks for the explanation!

[15:44] <kawaii> nine: might be best asking in the #cro channel, but currently that is a pretty major problem with the architecture, those errors are not passed back up the pipeline so sockets seem to just 'die' silently and your application has no idea.
