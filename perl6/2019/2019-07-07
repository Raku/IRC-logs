[09:12] <woolfy> Aearnus++ "spit accurately so we know where we can clean up"

[09:14] <woolfy> Jay36 : Not necessary advisable.  Plenty of people who came from (or are still using) Perl 5 who now are avid Perl 6 users.

[09:14] <woolfy> Jay36 : But if you come from somewhere completely different, like Erlang, C++, Haskell, Java, or Cobol, or if you never programmed at all, it would not be a problem at all to start with Perl 6 without any prior knowledge of Perl 5.

[09:15] <woolfy> Jay36 : Plenty of people who did that.  Several Perl 6 core developers did that.

[09:16] <woolfy> Jay36 : But in that case, be aware that some Perl 6 things are as they are because Perl 6 was designed to solve a long list of problems in Perl 5.

[09:17] <woolfy> Ah...  "Jay36 left the room"   Well, I hope Jay reads it at some point.

[11:42] <Kaiepi> there's still a little more work on the moar end of things i need to do before i can say i'm done with it, and i still need to stub the jvm and js vm since implementing support for them will be just as big a project as it was for moar alone

[11:58] <sena_kun> Kaiepi, for binding to wchar and triends?

[13:34] <Ulti> im sad this article https://aearnus.github.io/2019/07/06/perl-6-is-cursed is trending for all the obvious and bad reasons on hacker news https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20374633#20374832

[13:35] <AlexDaniel> I agree with that comment btw

[13:35] <AlexDaniel> who cares about tests

[13:36] <AlexDaniel> and also, the tests are not that overwhelmingly full

[13:36] <timotimo> Ulti: it looks like you claimed that comma is written in perl6

[13:37] <AlexDaniel> ‚ÄúThis almost seems like satire, but not quite‚Äù and yeah I kinda feel the same way :)

[13:40] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: Rat.new(.denominator,.numerator)

[13:41] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: any reason why not to just .denominator / .numerator

[13:41] <timotimo> does Rat.new throw an exception when it exceeds the maximum precision perhaps?

[13:41] <Ulti> timotimo: I claimed it was a JetBrains based IDE for Perl 6

[13:41] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: Not really, they both create a new Rat.

[13:41] <Ulti> feel free to clarfiy it there

[13:42] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: I can change it if you feel it would be better.

[13:42] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: well it's more idiomatic I think?

[13:42] <timotimo> "there are even nice things built out of them like the Cro microservices framework https://cro.services/. That you can also build applications out of that using a full JetBrains based IDE"

[13:42] <timotimo> that reads like the "full jetbrains based ide" is built "out of" Cro

[13:43] <timotimo> or at least that it's built out of the concurrency and parallelism features

[13:43] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: Ok, not a big deal, will change

[13:43] <timotimo> and i can't clarify it there, because i don't have and will probably never have an account on that site

[13:44] <Ulti> timotimo: doesnt read that way to me since there is a fullstop in the middle

[13:45] <Ulti> I meant more you can build apllications use the IDE and Cro has nice integration

[13:45] <timotimo> oh

[13:45] <timotimo> i seem to have misread the "using" there

[13:45] <timotimo> sorry, now that i read it for the fourth time it finally clicked what that sentence actually says

[13:46] <ugexe> Myth: "People aren't using Perl 6 because ..." Reality: "I don't like Perl6 because"

[13:46] <ugexe> I love when people talk with authority they do not have

[13:46] <Ulti> timotimo: updated it

[13:47] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: Ok, fix (and another sequence) pushed

[13:49] <timotimo> lol can someone tell smt88 that neither will python, java, C++, and others?

[13:49] <timotimo> no, i won't get into this any more

[13:53] <lizmat> hmmm...not quite what I was going for when I posted that on HN, but otoh, it's exposure... 

[13:54] <lizmat> and at least comment said a look at Perl 6 would be made

[13:59] <lizmat> well, it makes clear how people think about Perl 6 and Perl in general

[13:59] <lizmat> outside of the echo chamber

[14:00] <timotimo> inside that other echo chamber :P

[14:00] <ugexe> Damian seems to not have this problem communicating about Perl 6

[14:00] <timotimo> maybe not echo chamber. perhaps more of a bickering pit

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> alriight

[14:03] <AlexDaniel> I'll be around for a bit more to merge PRs if more are coming

[14:04] <ugexe> "The biggest issue with Perl 6 IMO is that there are no "official" scaff holding framework(s) for anything." like this comment... where do i start

[14:04] <tobs> AlexDaniel: my last PR is just a prove away

[14:04] <AlexDaniel> tobs: nice!

[14:04] <timotimo> that looks like something typed on a smartphone keyboard with auto"correct"

[14:05] <timotimo> but i kind of like "scaff holding"

[14:05] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: Don't wait on me. I don't have anything pushable in the near future. 

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: also nice, you did great :) take a nice break

[14:05] <ugexe> how did they come to that conclusion? what other problems with the language did they encounter that were not as bad as that apparent problem? the answer to these is they've never really looked into any of this

[14:05] <AlexDaniel> now I have to somehow count how many sequences were implemented, hmm

[14:06] <sena_kun> >Perl 6‚Äôs most popular compiler is Rakudo Star

[14:06] <sena_kun> this is something new to know

[14:06] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: yeah because we like confusing things :)

[14:07] <ugexe> people who have never in their life had their opinion count when it comes to making architectural choices want to have their voice heard in the only place their lack of authority cant stop them

[14:16] <AlexDaniel> tobs: oh and there's a totient sub now

[14:17] <AlexDaniel> tobs: I think I had a sequence where I needed it badly‚Ä¶

[14:17] <thundergnat> tobs: agree with Alexdaniel, wow. 

[14:18] *** mowcat joined
[14:18] <AlexDaniel> and moebius too, amazing

[14:18] *** HarmtH joined
[14:18] <tobs> arrays are kinda hard to reuse I found

[14:18] <AlexDaniel> yeah

[14:20] *** pmurias joined
[14:20] <thundergnat> I think ajs should really reconsider having the sequences as exported array and re-implement them as generator subs. (Issue #39) 

[14:21] <thundergnat> Would probably make them easier to reuse.

[14:22] <pmurias> lizmat: a lot the comments on hackernews where in regards to dubious responses to the myths

[14:22] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: yeah, that

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: maybe you should leave a comment on #39 :)

[14:23] <thundergnat> That's a major change to the inner workings though. 

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> I don't think so

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> many if not most sequences will remain the same

[14:23] <AlexDaniel> it's just some of them that really can benefit from reimplementation

[14:24] <AlexDaniel> and you can pregenerate a fallback sub like sub A00foo($n) { @A00foo[$n] }

[14:25] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: in fact, that's a good start I think. Just having a sub that accesses the array

[14:25] <AlexDaniel> then you can start moving the implementation to the sub if it's appropriate for a particular sequence

[14:26] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: True. I'd want to get some buy in from ajs before I would invest too much work in a fundamental change to the module though.

[14:26] <AlexDaniel> and for some sequences, you can perhaps have both

[14:27] <tobs> AlexDaniel: do you want to finish A001055? It seems doable: there is an easy formula for prime power arguments and A066032 contains a recursive formula for other composite numbers. These two have to be put together.

[14:27] <AlexDaniel> one implementation that needs previous elements, and another that can generate an element right away but slower

[14:27] <AlexDaniel> tobs: try it‚Ä¶ I had most of the values correct except some

[14:28] <AlexDaniel> tobs: but I was relying on factors() and that is somehow wrong, I couldn't figure out why

[14:28] *** pmurias_ joined
[14:28] <AlexDaniel> tobs: it generates correct elements up to [11] I think, where it's off by one‚Ä¶ and most of the sequence is correct except some values

[14:31] <tobs> Bummer that A000001 is ridiculously hard :D

[14:41] <AlexDaniel> tobs: yes :D :D

[14:41] <AlexDaniel> I even made sure to submit tickets in reverse order so that they're kinda ascending in the list

[14:42] <AlexDaniel> and now A000001 is the first ticket people see

[15:35] *** mowcat left
[15:36] *** Manifest0 joined
[15:40] <ugexe> i'm making fun of how joe nobody always wants to inform everyone of why OTHER PEOPLE dont use Perl 6. occasionally you get some good critisms from e.g. reini urban, but most of the time its some nobody looking for point out some little thing they noticed while investigating superficially and want validation

[15:40] <ugexe> these people never say "I dont use Perl 6" its always "People dont use Perl 6". they need to reassure their position by procting

[15:41] <ugexe> projecting^

[15:41] *** Manifest0 left
[15:42] <pmurias_> jugding why other people (don't) use something is hard

[15:42] <ugexe> right, so people with no fucking clue shouldn't make such claims

[15:42] *** Cabanossi joined
[15:43] <ugexe> however -- that puts their own ass on the line if their opinion is wrong. instead you just claim your opinion is fact/majority so no one challenges you

[15:43] <ugexe> so the question is: how do you effectively call these people out without appearing to just be angry?

[15:44] <tbrowder>  ref math-seq squashathon: i noticed move to .t6 suffix for tests--should module authors make that move as a TODO task? should that be mentioned in the docs for module authors?

[15:44] <pmurias_> I'm not sure if that particular comment was meant to express anything more than what the random joe in question expected

[15:45] <ugexe> then why would they not say "I"

[15:45] <pmurias_> ugexe: having the opinions of a whole bunch of joes *who actually tried using* Perl 6 would have some value

[15:46] <ugexe> yes i agree

[15:46] *** Manifest0 joined
[15:46] <pmurias_> ugexe: I'm not sure people pay a lot of attention to the exact wording when composing a comment on hacker news

[15:46] <ugexe> lol

[15:47] <ugexe> if i posted a critisism about Go using "People"/"Everybody"/"Nobody" i'd get roasted

[15:52] <rfold> My colleagues have a lot of opinions about Perl and PHP but when I ask when they have last used it they can't give an answer.

[15:52] <timotimo> i'ven't used php in ages and i still occasionally catch myself mouthing off about it

[15:54] *** pmurias__ joined
[15:55] <ugexe> mouthing off is one thing. its another to make much more general claims like "Nobody uses php because" "PHP will never ... because"

[15:55] <tobs> m: bag(2 xx 4, 4 xx 3, 3 xx 1).min.say  # seems to DWIM but I can find neither documentation nor implementation

[15:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´2 => 4‚ê§¬ª

[15:55] <ugexe> i would wager most of the people making such claims have no say in what language is used at their work anyway

[15:55] <timotimo> it probably just goes via Any, i.e. calls self.List.min

[15:56] <tobs> (it returns the pair with minimum key here, which is what I want)

[15:56] <tobs> m: say (2 => 4) cmp (3 => 1)

[15:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´Less‚ê§¬ª

[15:56] <timotimo> m: say (22 => 4) cmp (3 => 1)

[15:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´More‚ê§¬ª

[15:57] <timotimo> watch out, it seems to be lexicographical sort

[15:57] <tobs> timotimo: seems to make sense

[15:57] <timotimo> so you'll want to use .min(:as(*.key.value.Int)) or so

[15:57] <tobs> O_O

[15:58] <pmurias__> ugexe: I would guess most people have no say in what languages get used in their work

[15:58] <rfold> p6: (2 => 4).perl.say

[15:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´2 => 4‚ê§¬ª

[15:58] *** pmurias left
[15:58] *** pmurias__ is now known as pmurias

[15:59] <rfold> p6: (2 => 4).key.WHAT.say

[15:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´(Int)‚ê§¬ª

[16:00] <timotimo> oh, hm

[16:00] <ugexe> yes. and most people aren't qualified to say why *people in general* aren't using some language

[16:02] <rfold> p6: %(2, 4, 3, 1).kv.perl.say

[16:02] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´("2", 4, "3", 1).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[16:02] <ugexe> so i have to ask: what are these generalized claims based on if they are not in a position to make their opinion on that count in the first place?

[16:02] *** dominix__ joined
[16:03] <ugexe> i have no issue with anyone using the word "I". its just usually reframed as a larger population

[16:03] <pmurias> I think a lot of them are just assuming that other people think like they do

[16:04] <timotimo> rfold: yeah, by default hashes stringify their keys

[16:05] <timotimo> m: :{2 => 4, 3 => 1}.kv.perl.say

[16:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´(3, 1, 2, 4).Seq‚ê§¬ª

[16:05] <rfold> p6: my %xs{Int}; %xs{2} = 4; %xs{3} = 1; %xs.perl.say; # timotimo: I recall it's possible to avoid that like this, what about literals?

[16:05] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´(my Any %{Int} = 2 => 4, 3 => 1)‚ê§¬ª

[16:05] *** dominix_ left
[16:06] <rfold> p6: (my Any %{Int} = 2 => 4, 3 => 1).perl.say

[16:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 84ee0c8ce: OUTPUT: ¬´(my Any %{Int} = 2 => 4, 3 => 1)‚ê§¬ª

[16:06] <rfold> Interesting!!!

[16:06] <pmurias> ugexe: why are people doing unfounded generalizations a big issue?

[16:07] *** MilkmanDan left
[16:08] <ugexe> why is fake news a big issue? spreading bad information is always an issue 

[16:08] <ugexe> maybe i should just start replying to such comments with just "fake news" :P

[16:09] <pmurias> don't do that

[16:09] <timotimo> @fake_news_dog: "bark bark bark"

[16:09] <sena_kun> pmurias, because thinking is a very hard cognitive process, so memoizing is used as a cheaper alternative. instead of real thinking, people tend to just read someone's opinion somewhere and copy that.

[16:09] <pmurias> that's a generalization about how people think

[16:10] <sena_kun> and then poof, X has an image of Y in mind of a lot of people and it is _hard_ to change that, because, once again, cognitive biases make change of opinion a hard thing.

[16:39] <TreyHarris> If I have a huge XML file and I want to do some testing against it in reasonable time--a case where, for example, in CSV I'd just grab the top 5% of the lines--how can I sample it and still have a valid XML file so that validating tools still work?

[16:42] *** Manifest0 joined
[16:46] *** patrickb left
[16:55] *** Manifest0 left
[16:56] <sena_kun> TreyHarris, is it a general question?

[16:57] <tbrowder> one thing you can start with is using xmllint to format it so its structure is readable. then you might be able to visually extract large but apparently valid chunks for further testing. note that xmllint will check the xml validity of the original and any extracted chunks.

[17:00] *** Manifest0 joined
[17:03] <tbrowder> er, how huge is huge? xmllint is very fast

[17:04] *** Manifest0 left
[17:04] <sena_kun> also, is it a one-time action or you need to take chunks of changing huge files from time to time?

[17:05] <sena_kun> it depends on xml too, but in general case I'd look for incremental parsers available.

[17:05] <tbrowder> some good p5 ones exist

[17:06] <tbrowder> p6 is a little rough at last look

[18:57] <tobs> I've just given up on A001055 as well. No algorithm I found was as easy as I thought while being as fast as I wanted.

[18:59] *** veesh joined
[19:06] <tbrowder> AlexDaniel: ++ for you! and glad to find something a non-mathematician could do

[19:07] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: initially there were many sequences that were relatively easy, but these unsurprisingly got implemented really fast

[19:07] <MasterDuke> definitely, AlexDaniel++ too

[19:08] <tbrowder> the

[19:08] <MasterDuke> there is a Perl6 version of Regexp::Common, right? is it complete compared to the Perl5 version?

[19:08] <tbrowder> thundergnat: well done!

[19:09] <AlexDaniel> I wonder if Math::Sequences will ever be extended beyond core sequences

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> if so, maybe a few months later we can do it again. I think there are many fun sequences out there :)

[19:10] <thundergnat> Thanks, all. I enjoyed this squashathon. 

[19:10] <AlexDaniel> stuff like http://oeis.org/A085808

[19:11] <thundergnat> Big kudos to AlexDaniel++ for making it all run smoothly. 

[19:11] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äúas an example of a sequence which should not be in the OEIS‚Äù ha

[19:11] <MasterDuke> ha

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> http://oeis.org/search?q=dumb&language=english&go=Search

[19:12] <AlexDaniel> ‚Äúdumb sequences squashathon‚Äù :)

[19:13] <thundergnat> A lot of the remaining cor sequences really need someone who is strong in category and set theory, both of which I have heard of :-/

[19:15] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: yeah, many times I found it was much easier trying to understand maple algorithms than reading the sequence description :S

[19:16] <tbrowder> here's a rough squashathon idea: have module authors submit module names they would like help with (maybe limit to max of one per author) and either vote for a subset or list them all for grabs to work on

[19:16] <veesh> how about porting Tensorflow

[19:16] <veesh> or MXNet

[19:16] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: we did this on 2018-10-06

[19:17] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: here's the list of past squashathons: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/wiki/Monthly-Bug-Squash-day-(archived-events)

[19:17] <veesh> raku could really pwn at writing the formulas as actual formulas

[19:17] <tbrowder> hm, i must have missed that one

[19:17] <veesh> and matrix operations and stuff

[19:17] <AlexDaniel> tbrowder: it worked OK, but it wasn't as fantastic as ecosystem unbitrot :)

[19:18] <thundergnat> veesh like https://modules.perl6.org/dist/Math::Matrix:github:github:pierre-vigier perhaps?

[19:20] <AlexDaniel> veesh: as for writing formulas as formulas, Math::Sequences is as close as you can get, but to me it feels like the language is missing some small things

[19:20] <veesh> something like

[19:21] <veesh> i'm gonna learn more machine learning and then tell you what i expect

[19:22] <AlexDaniel> well, having a Tensorflow module would be amazing. They do have C API so maybe creating a module is much simpler than it sounds

[19:23] <veesh> it really should be, all the hard stuff happens in c

[19:23] <veesh> there should only be sugar in the perl land

[19:23] <veesh> and i'd expect it to be exceedingly sweet

[19:23] <veesh> b/c you can define arbitrary operators, the code could read so much nicer

[19:23] <veesh> although i'm not sure if machine learning code is meant to be read by humans

[19:24] <AlexDaniel> what code? :)

[19:24] <timotimo> once you're untethered from syntactical limitations of languages like python, maybe there's a way to express setting up these tensorflow thingies that's more easy to learn or understand or whatever

[19:25] <AlexDaniel> I mean‚Ä¶ most people don't write stuff with tensor ops themselves

[19:25] <AlexDaniel> you just do data preparation and stuff, and then just throw your data into the existing library to do training and evaluation

[19:26] <timotimo> yeah

[19:26] <timotimo> still all that stuff has to be configured and set up

[19:26] <tobs> AlexDaniel: I was tempted at a few occasions to go beyond core. almost-primes are easy using &prime-signature for example. Other non-core sequences are specific readings of 2-ary functions which are not hard, etc.

[19:26] <thundergnat> I would _love_ to get a native Perl 6 port of Perl 5s ntheory module. It's pretty much all gmp under the hood (with a bunch of sugar) usining if :from<Perl5> sortof works, but a native port would be awesome.

[19:27] <thundergnat> sheesh *using it

[19:28] <thundergnat> It would have made a bunch of the sequence code easier / faster.

[21:02] <TreyHarris> I just discovered that I've been bugfixing and feature-adding to my private fork of Emacs perl6-mode for the past year, all this time thinking that I was doing it against perl6/perl6-mode. *blush*

[21:03] <TreyHarris> I thought it slightly surprising that nobody had any issues at all with my changes or suggestions for improvements, but I supposed that just meant that most Perl 6 programmers don't use Emacs

[21:03] <veesh> who uses emacs at all?

[21:03] <veesh> </joke>

[21:04] <MasterDuke> i think the most recent survey had a higher percentage of perl6 users using emacs than the overall percentage of users in the SO survey

[21:05] <veesh> did anyone else put their gender as mayonaise on that survey?

[21:05] <TreyHarris> It was only when I noticed that the version in the Emacs package list didn't have my changes and tried to figure out why no package release had been picked up in the past year that I figured this out

[21:05] <veesh> i didn't see it as a datapoint in the dump they had there

[21:08] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:10] <TreyHarris> I'm going to try to rebase all the bugfixes together and maybe the other changes by issue if it isn't a big pain to do so, and then maybe push them out over a two or three weekly updates
