[00:39] <Kaiepi> vrurg, netbsd also has its own make

[00:39] <vrurg> Kaiepi: which is BSD make in nature.

[00:39] <Kaiepi> it differs slightly from the other bsd makes

[00:40] <Kaiepi> it's really strict about .PREFIXES

[00:40] <Kaiepi> if you forget to include one the make will fail

[00:40] <Kaiepi> this doesn't happen on openbsd or freebsd's make

[00:40] *** aborazmeh left
[00:41] <vrurg> Let's see if it affects the build when my fix for BSDs makes it into the master.

[00:41] <vrurg> And in any way, I made Configure to check for gmake first and then fall back to make.

[00:44] * vrurg would probably need a VM with netbsd too...

[00:52] <Kaiepi> how come feeds are much slower?

[00:53] *** Manifest0 joined
[00:54] <vrurg> Kaiepi: This is just a guess, but <== is a operator; i.e. ‚Äì a routine. It adds the cost of calling two routines and executing their code. 

[00:54] <vrurg> Considering that most likely those are multi dispatch ‚Äì this also has the price tag on it.

[00:56] <Kaiepi> ah

[00:57] <Kaiepi> actually <== is handled by the grammar

[01:00] <Kaiepi> taking a look at the actions for it i think it could be possible to optimize it some

[01:01] <vrurg> Then I'm wrong.

[04:00] <Xliff> \o

[04:00] <holyghost> Xliff : did you see my email ?

[04:00] <Xliff> Um... lemme check.

[04:01] <Xliff> Last one is from April 29

[04:01] <holyghost> ah

[04:01] <holyghost> Can you send me the permanent ip ?

[04:02] <holyghost> I sent you an email a few days ago

[04:02] <holyghost> Do you need a new public key ?

[04:02] *** Manifest0 joined
[04:03] <Xliff> I don't have any emails from you since the 29th.

[04:03] <holyghost> strange

[04:03] <Xliff> I just privmsg'd you the IP

[04:05] <holyghost> I just logged in, thx

[04:05] <holyghost> It's a VM ?

[04:06] <Xliff> It is EC2

[04:06] <holyghost> what's EC2 ?

[04:06] <Xliff> Google: "Amazon EC2"

[04:07] <Xliff> I'm pretty sure it is virtual, but I think EC2 is more than a VM.

[04:07] <Xliff> It is run on some pretty serious hardware.

[04:11] <holyghost> I thought you set up the server

[04:11] <holyghost> I thank you for it though but some things are somewhat contricted as to access disk tools for example

[04:12] <Xliff> I did set up the server.

[04:12] <holyghost> Anyway, you're very helpful for perl6 

[04:12] <holyghost> if I may say so

[04:12] <Xliff> I am within the free tier still. Like I said before. If you need space, you can help me pay for it.

[05:10] <yoleaux> 13 May 2019 17:12Z <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: Hey, what if we take all tickets and cluster them based on something cool, like title similarity or something? Then instead of 1000 tickets or whatever we'll have just a bunch of topics with clustered tickets, maybe that'd make fixing things easier? Or maybe at least closing duplicates easier? Or something?

[05:10] <yoleaux> 13 May 2019 17:12Z <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-13#l544

[05:10] <releasable6> jmerelo, No! It wasn't me! It was the one-armed man! Backtrace: https://gist.github.com/2d153de89200ea673410966b5071d077

[05:12] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: it was rescheduled

[05:12] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: do you know where did the VERSION file go? ‚Üë

[05:12] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: how do you think clustering tickets would help?

[05:13] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: plus I guess someone has to actually do that, right?

[05:13] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: say you find a ticket on RT, look at it, and realize that it is already closed. It's probably a good idea to check related tickets too

[05:14] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: so chances are that you'll close more than one, which is great for reducing the total number of ticktes

[05:14] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: also, what is this? https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/a643b8be148b85d6d21c31a1474ffcb178a83653#diff-8903239df476d7401cf9e76af0252622R3

[05:14] <AlexDaniel> vrurg: why is it not in the perl6 organization?

[05:15] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: theoretically that should be done already. Plus the more issues there are, the more work you have to do to find related issues.

[05:16] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: yes but I mean if we can do it in some automated way?

[05:16] <AlexDaniel> like a graph or something

[05:17] *** releasable6 left
[05:17] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: off the top of my head, NLP could be used for doing it, or references to code. But that wouldn't help much either unless it's present while you're doing the work.

[05:21] <jmerelo> I mean, as part of the GUI of the editor.

[09:22] <timotimo> please give it a try

[09:27] <nadim> I talked about a "bug" two days ago, signature matching was wrong. I had to write "@sub_elements Z 0..* -> (@x, $index)" then unpack @x manually. the original code,wich I believed worked earlier was "or @sub_elements Z 0..* -> (($k, $b, $element), $index)" 

[09:28] <nadim> I hit the same bug again yesterday

[09:28] <nadim> where do I report this? it seems to be serious enough so I don't just put a workaround inmy code

[09:29] *** xinming joined
[09:29] <jnthn> Waht error did you get?

[09:29] <timotimo> m: my @sub_elements = (1, 2), ("a", "b"), ("x", "y"); for @sub_elements -> (($a, $b), $index) { say "a: $a, b: $b, index: $index" }

[09:30] <timotimo> haha

[09:30] <timotimo> m: my @sub_elements = (1, 2), ("a", "b"), ("x", "y"); for @sub_elements Z 0..* -> (($a, $b), $index) { say "a: $a, b: $b, index: $index" }

[09:30] <timotimo> the problem with nadim's code is that the third thing in the inner lists of @sub_elements are Pair objects

[09:30] <timotimo> and they are being treated as named arguments even though the keys are not identifier-like

[09:32] <nadim> exactely

[09:32] <timotimo> that's very important to mention

[09:33] <timotimo> having jnthn's attention right now is good

[09:33] *** qiqi left
[09:33] <jnthn> Ah, so it's not about binding, but about the thing .Capture is producing?

[09:34] <timotimo> m: say (1, 2, "blorp! blorp? blorb." => 99).Capture

[09:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: ¬´\(1, 2, "blorp! blorp? blorb." => 99)‚ê§¬ª

[09:36] <nadim> I don't know what it's about, I amjust good at fonding stuff that doesn't workit seems, but it would be nice to have it written somewhere.

[09:37] <nadim> do I report it here https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo

[09:39] <jnthn> Well, it's not so much "doesn't work" as in "you don't like the way it works"

[09:39] <jnthn> *as it is

[09:40] <nadim> I have a Pair that I want extracted and it fails, indeed I don't like it :)

[09:40] *** feldspath joined
[09:43] <jnthn> Alas, if we change it, then we break stuff for anyone who expected the pairs to become nameds :)

[09:45] <nadim> I will be fine with wichever as long as it is clearly documented and makes sense (and if it doesn't make sense I will befine but not happy about it but that's not important)

[09:45] <nadim> even if the comment was a positive one, the code looks ugly https://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?1198687

[09:46] <jnthn> I'm sympathetic to how you want it to work, at least

[09:46] <nadim> :)

[09:47] <nadim> would: for @sub_elements Z 0..* -> (($k, $b, Pair $element), $index) work, be OK?

[09:47] <nadim> at least that would make it clear what is expected

[09:48] <jnthn> No, that's now how this stuff works

[09:48] <jnthn> It's a clear 2-step process. 1) Coerce the thing into a Capture. 2) Bind the signature to the Capture.

[09:49] <jnthn> The content of the sub-signature doesn't influence the first step.

[09:49] <nadim> ah!

[09:53] <nadim> the line I wrote above was en attempt to make the first step aware

[09:54] <nadim> is there any way or it's just to wait till it breaks and fix it manually?

[09:59] <jnthn> Well, the behavior is defined in terms of the .Capture coercion method on the argument

[09:59] <jnthn> So if you have your own class there (sublcass of Array, say) then you could override it and define the unpack behavior you wish

[10:00] <jnthn> While I've not seen it used much in the wild yet, any class can decide how it's going to look for the purpose of signature unpacking.

[10:01] <nadim> not a specific class but I'll look into eliminating the Pair altogether if I can

[12:29] <timotimo> YES

[12:29] <AlexDaniel`> if that actually renders like that in a terminal that'd be AWESOME

[12:31] <tadzik> it renders in mine :)

[12:31] <tadzik> well, not like the thing in the picture

[12:33] <timotimo> i agree, it'd be kind of cool to have in terminals

[12:33] <timotimo> for sparklines and such

[12:33] <masak> I can see it in my terminal as well

[12:33] *** squashable6 joined
[12:33] <timotimo> but is it disconnected vertical lines with tick marks on their left side?

[12:33] <timotimo> or is it like a line chart?

[12:40] <tadzik> the former for me, but I visciously uninstalled all emoji fonts I had

[12:40] <timotimo> ha

[12:41] <AlexDaniel`> yeah surely it renders as something, but a line chart is what I'm looking for :)

[12:58] <timotimo> braille lets you do funny stuff, too, because the characters give you essentially a 2x4 matrix

[13:11] <timotimo> there's already a libaa and a libcaca backend to mplayer at least, and a libaa one for SDL1 if i'm not mistaken

[20:11] <moritz> antoniogamiz: if you know an operator's symbol, but not if it's an infix, prefix, postfix, whateverfix, you can just add the operator to the URL and get some kind of explanation what it could be

[20:12] <moritz> same with: you know a name (like "wrap"), but don't remember if it's a type or a sub or a method or so

[20:12] <moritz> you just put docs.perl6.org/wrap in your address bar, and then you get an explanation what it is

[20:33] <yoleaux> 13 May 2019 23:45Z <SmokeMachine> sena_kun: Cro::HTTP::Session::Red seems to be working... :) I just need some tests now...

[20:34] <sena_kun> \o/

[20:34] <Xliff> antoniogamiz: You can shorten that last line to: '@todo .= duckmap( -> $_ where .d { .IO.dir.Slip; } );'

[20:34] <yoleaux> 12:04Z <holyghost> Xliff: I would like you to install scsh (scheme shell, needs scheme48 maybe)

[20:35] <Xliff> .tell holyghost Please send me an email with that request. Thanks.

[20:35] <yoleaux> Xliff: I'll pass your message to holyghost.

[20:36] <zostay> and .IO.dir.Slip can be written as |.IO.dir

[20:36] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, why not just 'my @a = '.'.IO.dir; flat @a.map({ .d ?? .dir !! ()})'?

[20:44] <zostay> TMTOWTDI, IMO if it does what you need, it's Perlish enough.

[20:59] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: I want to list all files in a directory (and in the subdirs)

[21:00] <antoniogamiz> Xliff: uoh true, ty! :)

[21:00] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: the way you say doesnt list subdirectories I think

[21:01] *** Manifest0 joined
[21:01] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, do you want it to recursively list all sub-directories or just a first level under root?

[21:02] <antoniogamiz> recursively

[21:02] <sena_kun> ah

[21:02] <antoniogamiz> that's why I use duckmap

[21:02] <sena_kun> I see. cool

[21:02] * sena_kun didn't know how duckmap work

[21:02] <antoniogamiz> though with map it's possible too

[21:03] <antoniogamiz> duckmap applies the function you pass it if the element walks and talks like a duck :D

[21:04] <zostay> I'm thinking your version isn't recursive though either. You'll want a while any(@todo).d or something to guarantee the recursion, though that would assume you have no symlink loops, so be careful.

[21:04] *** robertle left
[21:06] <antoniogamiz> zostay: mmm you are right :ooo

[21:06] <antoniogamiz> I thought it worked as expected, I have the test wrong then xddd

[21:07] <antoniogamiz> I had another version but it used a push inside the duckmap 

[21:08] *** powerbit left
[21:08] <zostay> if you used @todo as the working list and accumulated the non-dirs in another list, it would perform better

[21:09] <zostay> then you could just keep going as long if @todo was non-empty and you could drop duckmap and just use map

[21:10] *** robertle joined
[21:13] <antoniogamiz> zostay: yep that was my first approach but jmerelo said me that I should try with duckmap!

[21:15] *** skids left
[21:17] <zostay> Yeah, as I said, there's a certain elegance to it that way. But iterating over all the files every time that aren't relevant to the search for dirs is going to slow things down a bit. That might not matter for your application, so it could be fine. 

[21:17] <Xliff> .tell holyghost scsh is not found via apt.

[21:17] <yoleaux> Xliff: I'll pass your message to holyghost.

[21:17] <antoniogamiz> zostay: I will have that in mind :)
