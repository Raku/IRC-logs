[00:08] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: pretty great, actually!

[00:08] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: thesis done, release done, army stuff figured out

[00:09] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: going to PerlCon (thanks to jnthn and Edument)

[00:09] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, I am very glad to hear that! Remember to don't stress yourself too much, overwork kills heroes. :)

[00:09] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, heh, guess we'll meet then. :)

[00:09] <AlexDaniel> yay

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> well, my plan for this month is to do *absolutely nothing*

[00:10] <AlexDaniel> besides things that bring me joy :)

[00:11] <AlexDaniel> because yes, I was overstressed lately :(

[00:11] <sena_kun> this is a great plan. I am thinking about something like that too, but likely can't afford slacking off more than a day per week, and even when I do, I have nothing to do besides work. :S

[00:13] <sena_kun> yet I hope things will become a bit less busier after Perlcon and I'll be able to do more stuff like resolving docs tickets after finishing master's paper's paper part.

[00:13] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: that's most likely not true! Give yourself a few hours of nothing to do, and you'll immediately start to come up with things :)

[00:14] <AlexDaniel> boredom is a cool feature when it comes to creative thinking :)

[00:14] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: oh, getting your Master's too?

[00:14] <AlexDaniel> good luck :)

[00:15] <sena_kun> AlexDaniel, thanks! Well, code wise it is plenty, I guess, but still have to write like 40 pages of Word(about 20 are already done), ouch.

[00:17] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: not latex, huh? :)

[00:18] <sena_kun> nope. :(

[00:18] <sena_kun> I remember when three years ago I thought that I'll prepare a presentation using some nice JS framework, not PowerPoint, because, you know, browser is everywhere, right?

[00:19] <timotimo> reveal.js, eh?

[00:19] <sena_kun> and on my defense the fun part is that it was displayed correctly when the browser was as a normal window

[00:19] <sena_kun> timotimo, yeah, IIRC

[00:19] <timotimo> oh lord, i once gave my laptop to someone else to run a presentation that was done with, iirc, pure HTML

[00:19] <sena_kun> but when I enabled fullscreen mode, suddenly the background became black, and I am, like, DAMN, WTF

[00:19] <timotimo> i.e. one slide per .html file i think?

[00:19] <sena_kun> so I had to do everything in a window mode which wasn't very impressive

[00:20] <timotimo> every single thing went wrong ... the size was tiny, resizing made no difference for whatever reason, the keyboard layout was, of course, neither de, nor us, it was neo2, because of course

[00:20] <sena_kun> and in any case, the paper is not interesting at all, I think

[00:21] <sena_kun> or, rather, interesting bit was published already and is now available to the world as pdf, and we have some real Perl 6 software with docs made in markdown, that's what matters.

[00:23] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: on my defense libreoffice impress crashed 2 times

[00:23] <AlexDaniel> sena_kun: and not just that, but one of the slides had corrupted images

[00:23] <sena_kun> :\

[00:24] <AlexDaniel> also impress doesn't really like videos, which I had plenty in my presentation

[00:24] <sena_kun> I usually prepared the slides with impress, and then before the process I usually checked the images in file and moved them to right places.

[00:24] <sena_kun> hmmmmm

[00:24] <sena_kun> the real question is where I should prepare slides for Perlcon.

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> there's absolutely nothing I can recommend

[00:25] <AlexDaniel> software sucks :)

[00:25] <sena_kun> software sucks. :)

[00:26] <sena_kun> well, it is more a question of if they provide you some screen you can connect too, or are you using their laptop with your files.

[00:26] <sena_kun> inb4: it is 18th already and you still don't have _two_ sets of slides ready?

[06:59] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: Some people (including me) might be already in Riga, I'm arriving on Sunday

[07:00] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: but some people (including me) might be exhausted after Perlcon, so I guess not.

[07:00] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: and moving it to the middle of PerlCon and do it physically while we're there? Maybe a BoFH?

[07:01] <AlexDaniel> I have no idea how this stuff goes, it'll be my first conference

[07:02] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: with BoFH you request a room from the orgas and do whatever you want. It can be from origami to a mini-con

[07:02] <jmerelo> But of course people will want to go to the talks, so maybe it's not such a good idea.

[07:03] <jmerelo> Let's leave it be the way it's now. I don't know what was the topic that was left, also. Maybe discuss here the topic.

[07:04] *** TeamBlast left

[07:05] <AlexDaniel> that one is hard

[07:06] *** TeamBlast joined
[07:06] *** sauvin joined
[07:06] <AlexDaniel> if we're talking about https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues then most of the tickets are relatively fresh

[07:06] <AlexDaniel> so not much you can easily close without fixing stuff

[07:07] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: but that's but one of the issues you raise in the other one.

[07:07] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I raise a lot of issues there :)

[07:07] <dominix> bug filled #3060

[07:07] <jmerelo> dominix: R#3060

[07:07] <synopsebot> R#3060 [open]: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/3060 Nativecall fail on ubuntu.

[07:08] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: maybe unbitrot

[07:09] <AlexDaniel> dominix: thanks

[07:09] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: third time?

[07:10] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: third's the charm :-)

[07:10] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: no, really, I think we should do MOLD, if for anything else, to raise the issue and get a few people (including me) more acquainted wih the whole stack.

[07:11] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: we can't do MOLD before tickets are moved

[07:11] <AlexDaniel> sorting out issues from the old issue tracker will be a great squashathon

[07:12] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: we can work exclusively on the PRs, for instance: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pulls. First one is from 2013. Maybe close some (or most) of them, or create new ones on the new codebase

[07:13] <AlexDaniel> yeah, but merging PRs requires permissions, and deciding which ones should be outright closed needs some dev knowledge‚Ä¶

[07:13] <AlexDaniel> so I can't see how newcomers can approach that

[07:14] <AlexDaniel> (maybe I'm just a bad newcomer :P)

[07:14] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: as long as there are a few with a commit bit, newcomers can ping issues, maybe check out changes in the code, if there are conflicts solve them with the new codebase, and make a new PR

[07:15] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: anything you do in MoarVM/NQP/Rakudo is going to need the intervention of the team, anyway. It's just a matter of having a cadre of them ready to address, merge or close PRs.

[07:16] <Xliff> How do I do array decomp?

[07:17] <jmerelo> Xliff: if you mean decont, <>

[07:17] <Xliff> No. I mean take elements out of an array that is in the argument list

[07:17] <jmerelo> Xliff: surround the arguments with a parenthesis

[07:18] <jmerelo> m: sub foo( ($bar,$baz) ) { say "$bar and then $baz" }; my @array = <hey you>; foo(@array)

[07:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar c112ac12a: OUTPUT: ¬´hey and then you‚ê§¬ª

[07:18] <Xliff> jmerelo++

[07:21] <jmerelo> BTW, you're not asking enough questions in StackOverflow... I'll have to ask everyone to ask again :-)

[07:22] <Xliff> I generally don't do SO... :p

[07:22] <jmerelo> Xliff: I didn't mean to call you on that, I just remembered... :-)

[07:23] <Xliff> Ahh...

[07:23] <Xliff> I mean... if I ever run into that kind of trouble, I will use it!

[07:23] <jmerelo> We need more questions and answers to increase visibility, help newcomers, and be generally awesome. We reached a peak a few months ago, but this month has been, like, tumbleweed and all that.

[07:24] <jmerelo> Check this out: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/847857/perl6-questions-per-month

[07:25] <jmerelo> It's gone down pretty sharply in the last few months. This is like our stock listing in the stock exchange, only it's, well, StackExchange. And it's going down.

[07:26] <Xliff> Overall trend is up, though.

[07:26] <Xliff> Best month was last may

[07:26] <Xliff> Er... may 2018

[07:27] <jmerelo> Xliff: yep, it's OK in general, but it's a bumpy road. The thing is we're so few that someone getting into a project and starting to fire questions creates a peak

[07:27] <Xliff> Yes.

[07:27] <Xliff> Well, I will do what I can.

[07:27] <Xliff> I typically figure out my own problems, however.

[07:27] <jmerelo> Xliff: thanks, Xliff. 

[07:28] <jmerelo> Xliff: yep, that's the thing, most people in the community kinda keep trying until the find the solution; but we need the extra visibility, at least untill we have a steady flow of questions in SO

[07:29] <El_Che> morning

[07:29] <jmerelo> Xliff: in SO you can even ask questions and answer them later on. That way, the question (and answer) are there for everyone to check.

[07:29] <jmerelo> El_Che: hey!

[07:30] <Xliff> jmerelo: Yes, but it's a hassle when I am working on my projects to take a break just to post a question on SO.

[07:30] <Xliff> Like I said, I will keep it in mind, but I can't force it.

[07:30] <jmerelo> Xliff: thanks!

[07:31] <El_Che> ok, fixed the centos build (nqp added a new p5 dependency) and now looking at the failed ubuntu disco one: t/08-performance/99-misc.t ...................................... Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)

[07:31] <El_Che> it's looks like a flopper, so I'll run it again

[07:31] <El_Che> (i must say that there a lot less of flopping tests compared to the past!)

[07:33] <El_Che> AlexDaniel: Thank you for the release!

[07:34] <AlexDaniel> you're welcome

[07:34] <AlexDaniel> El_Che: freaking flappers, I hate them

[18:04] <melezhik> does perl6 -I directive should precede -MModule ? 

[18:04] <melezhik> perl6  -I /home/melezhik/projects/tmp2 -MFoo -e 'say "ok"'

[18:05] <melezhik> gives ok

[18:05] <melezhik> perl6  -MFoo -I /home/melezhik/projects/tmp2  -e 'say "ok"'

[18:05] <timotimo> so your question is more "is this a bug or intentional"?

[18:05] <melezhik> gives "===SORRY!===

[18:05] <melezhik> is it a bug?

[18:06] <timotimo> i would think of a -I to be equivalent to "use lib 'blah'" and a -M to be equivalent to "use blah"

[18:06] <timotimo> so it would make sense that -I only affects what's after it

[18:06] <melezhik> ok

[18:06] *** Manifest0 left
[18:07] <melezhik> perl6    -e 'say "ok"' -MUnexistsedModule

[18:07] <melezhik> gives "ok"

[18:07] <timotimo> well, yeah

[18:07] <melezhik> surprisingly for me

[18:07] <timotimo> you're passing -Mblah to the -e 'blah' program

[18:07] <timotimo> perl6 -e 'say @*ARGS' -a -b 1 2 3

[18:07] *** Sgeo_ joined
[18:08] <melezhik> I mean surprisingly, because module does not exit 

[18:08] <melezhik> should it raise an issue?

[18:08] <timotimo> no

[18:08] <timotimo> that's not a parameter to perl6

[18:08] <timotimo> it's a parameter to your script

[18:08] <melezhik> ?

[18:08] <timotimo> everything after -e is parameters to the -e code

[18:08] <melezhik> what the difference in terms it's anyway the module that does not exit

[18:09] <melezhik> exist

[18:09] <timotimo> after -e, the meaning is no longer there

[18:09] <melezhik> still confused here 

[18:10] <timotimo> rakudo doesn't parse any arguments after -e 'script'

[18:10] <melezhik> perl6    -e 'say "ok"; -MUnexistsedModule'

[18:10] <timotimo> the arguments are passed directly to the code you have in the -e

[20:07] *** Hadi joined
[20:08] <Hadi> hi

[20:08] <kawaii> hello Hadi o/

[20:08] <Hadi> i followed the instruction to install rakudo on windows

[20:09] <Hadi> but it didn't give me an executable file

[20:10] <timotimo> i believe it's supposed to come with at least a perl6.bat, or maybe nowadays it's only a perl6.exe?

[20:10] <timotimo> does the folder you've installed it have a "bin" folder with stuff in it?

[20:11] <Hadi> it has bin folder

[20:11] <Hadi> but there isnt any .exe file

[20:11] <timotimo> is there a perl6.bat?

[20:11] <Hadi> no

[20:12] <timotimo> OK, can you point us at the instructions you were following?

[20:12] <Hadi> http://rakudo.org/files/star/windows

[20:13] <timotimo> ah, in the .03 release we definitely didn't have perl6.exe yet

[20:13] <Hadi> what should i do?

[20:13] <timotimo> is there a moar.exe?

[20:13] <Hadi> yes

[20:13] <Hadi> i open it but doesnt work

[20:13] <timotimo> that's the actual exe that will be running for perl6 programs, but it takes a bunch of parameters to launch it right, which are supposed to be in the perl6.bat

[20:14] <timotimo> i don't have a windows, so i can't really try it out on my own machine :(

[20:14] <Hadi> i also tried to install it on ubuntu

[20:14] <Hadi> http://rakudo.org/files/star/source

[20:15] <Hadi> i choosed this instruction

[20:15] <Hadi> it worked till end but i dont know what i should do then

[20:15] <timotimo> so the last thing you did was put the PATH stuff into your ~/.bashrc?

[20:16] *** molaf joined
[20:16] <Hadi> i wrote this : echo "export PATH=$(pwd)/install/bin/:$(pwd)/install/share/perl6/site/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

[20:16] <Hadi> and then :source ~/.bashrc

[20:16] <timotimo> OK, after that you should be able to do: perl6 -e 'say "hello"'

[20:17] <Hadi> how can i run the rakudo?

[20:17] <timotimo> rakudo is installed as a "perl6" command

[20:18] <timotimo> just "perl6" gives you the REPL where you can write code one statement at a time, and "perl6 bloop.p6" will run code from the file "bloop.p6" in your current folder

[20:18] <Hadi> how can i run perl6 ?

[20:19] <Hadi> and where can i write my code?

[20:19] <timotimo> you'd use any text editor or code editor; notepad.exe on windows is enough, but you'll probably want something a little bit more sophisticated

[20:20] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/user-experience/issues/19 - this has a table of editors along with whether they work with perl6 or not

[20:21] <Hadi> so i write my code in a text editor

[20:21] <Hadi> how can i run it with terminal?

[20:21] <timotimo> you'd "cd" to where the file you wrote is (often in your file browser you can right-click and "open a terminal here" to get there more easily) and then put "perl6 thefilename.p6" in there

[20:22] <timotimo> can also "perl6 blahblah.txt", the file ending doesn't matter here

[20:22] <Hadi> nice

[20:23] <Hadi> it seems it is easy to work with it

[20:23] *** reach_satori left
[20:23] <Hadi> thanks

[20:23] <timotimo> there's also websites that let you put code in them and run them with perl6, then you can share the code with others on the chat or elsewhere on the internet

[20:23] *** reach_satori joined
[20:23] <timotimo> feel free to stay here and ask more questions, though i'll be AFK for dinner in a little bit

[20:24] <Hadi> just a question

[20:25] <Hadi> i started learning perl6 with the book of : brian d foy - Learning Perl 6_ Keeping the Easy, Hard, and Impossible within Reach-O‚ÄôReilly Media (2018)

[20:25] <timotimo> ah, cool

[20:25] <Hadi> is it a good source for learning perl6? 

[20:25] <timotimo> i haven't read it yet, but i would assume it's quite good

[20:26] <Hadi> how do you prefer to learn perl6?

[20:26] <timotimo> when i learned perl6 there were not yet any books written ;)

[20:26] <timotimo> so i find it difficult to answer that

[20:26] <tadzik> except The Book \o/

[20:27] <tadzik> https://github.com/perl6/book

[20:27] <timotimo> https://perl6book.com/ - this site has a flow chart

[20:27] <timotimo> oh, that book

[20:27] <timotimo> yeah, it wasn't complete back then, and it hasn't been updated in a long long time

[20:27] <tadzik> that's true

[20:28] <Hadi> thanks a lot

[20:28] <timotimo> Hadi: it depends a lot on whether you can already program, and what languages you've learned before

[20:29] <Hadi> i know oop on java

[20:29] <Hadi> i think i know))

[20:29] <timotimo> https://tio.run/#perl6 - this lets you run perl6 in a website, for example

[20:29] <timotimo> https://glot.io/new/perl6 - this as well

[20:30] <Hadi> thanks

[20:31] <Hadi> you helped me a lot

[20:31] <Hadi> is perl6 a good language to spend time for it?

[20:31] <tadzik> :) Feel free to ask questions about anything you find confusing

[20:31] <tadzik> I think it is, yes

[20:31] <tadzik> it may not be the best investment if you intend to make money with it (now at least), but it's a language that teaches you a lot

[20:32] <Hadi> so can we say it is died?

[20:32] <tadzik> if java is where most of your experience is you may find a lot of new things that will open your mind and make you think differently: and that'll influence how you write code it any other language

[20:32] <tadzik> oh, absolutely not: more like it's not an adult yet :P

[20:33] <Hadi> nice

[20:33] <Hadi> why did you choose perl6 ? what was your purpose?

[20:34] <tadzik> I wanted to learn something fun :)

[20:34] <timotimo> i was annoyed by python and perl 6 looked very powerful

[20:34] <kawaii> Same here really, the language looked both easy and fun

[20:34] <tadzik> and I was annoyed at Perl 5's shortcomings

[20:35] <tadzik> Perl 6 was very appealing, the people were excellent to be around and it was a new language so it was relatively easy to create something meaningful that people will use, give you feedback on and make you grow

[20:35] <kawaii> Yes the community is certainly the biggest plus imo

[20:36] <kawaii> no toxicity, no elitism

[20:36] <kawaii> I tried to learn Rust about a year ago and just got put off by Rust elitists

[20:36] <timotimo> why didn't you rewrite yourself in rust?

[20:36] <kawaii> people who would belittle you for not knowing something 'simple'

[20:36] <tadzik> huh, either you were unlucky or I was lucky :)

[20:37] <timotimo> ooooh the casserole is done \o/

[20:37] <timotimo> time to dig in

[20:37] <tadzik> is it the microwave casserole?

[20:37] <kawaii> enjoy

[20:37] <tadzik> Good thing a scientist didn't ruin it

[20:41] <timotimo> nope, it was heated up with a regular hot-air oven

[20:41] <timotimo> i don't know if "the microwave casserole" is a reference to something?

[20:46] <tadzik> it's an obscure one though

[20:46] <Elronnd> Hadi: I learned a lot from https://perl6intro.com/.  It's not complete by any means, but it is nice

[20:49] <Hadi> elronnd: thanks

[20:57] <kawaii> Reposting my question from earlier

[20:57] <kawaii> Are there any modules for working with network interfaces? i.e. I have a NIC capable of operating in monitor/promiscuous mode and would like to extract realtime data from it. Couldn't see anything on the modules site for that. 

[20:58] <sena_kun> we need to write one. :)

[20:58] <sena_kun> probably would be nice to just NativeCall something from C

[20:59] <kawaii> I hope someone takes it up soon then, got a project I'd like to do :)

[21:10] <kawaii> Elronnd: not that much of a wizard sadly

[21:11] <tadzik> I thought so too and then everyone started using my 10 lines long module installer

[21:12] <Elronnd> lol that's how you get leftpad

[21:13] <tadzik> :D

[21:13] <tadzik> ok it was 50 lines long https://github.com/tadzik/neutro/blob/1b5c8ae3f3d7fe1fcffe30ca0c9f74e8de48f713/neutro
