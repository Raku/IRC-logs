[00:02] <timotimo> zip two arrays together by combining the individual items with the => operator

[00:02] <timotimo> (also, stop at the shorter list's end)

[00:06] <leszekdubiel> Excellent.    :)   But hard to find in documentation...    I fount only here:  https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/the-x-and-z-metaoperators/

[00:06] *** ferreira joined
[00:11] <timotimo> not sure if there's a good way to make that searchable in the docs

[00:12] <timotimo> just chop off an initial Z or X and search for what's left recursively

[00:13] <leszekdubiel> Ok, thank you. Good night. Greetings from Poland. :) 

[00:15] <timotimo> good night leszekdubiel!

[10:01] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: did you include state:open in the body?

[10:01] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: no, and that's not needed

[10:01] *** pmurias joined
[10:01] <jjmerelo> Also note should indicate whether it's a new issue or we're just opening it

[10:01] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: if you change the issue it opens itself automatically?

[10:01] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: my goal is to not reopen close issued

[10:02] <AlexDaniel> closed issues* :)

[10:02] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: because closed issues can be from a year ago, they're no longer relevant

[10:02] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: but you're rewriting the issue...

[10:02] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: that being said, there's a link to the previous ticket in the ticket template

[10:02] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: no, it opens a brand new one

[10:02] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: Ah, OK.

[10:03] <jjmerelo> OK, you're good to go.

[10:03] <jjmerelo> I would have liked to have done it in another way, but, well...

[10:03] <AlexDaniel> jjmerelo: yea I get it, reopen if there's a ticket already. But then we should teach the script to write comments and do other stuff

[10:04] <AlexDaniel> it gets way more complicated this way, and also you still need to reopen after some time

[10:04] <AlexDaniel> oops I mean recreate

[10:28] <tyil> there's a bridge between this channel and the recently created Discord community :D

[10:29] <AlexDaniel> tyil: can you send a single ‚Äòhello‚Äô message so that we see how it works?

[10:29] <discord6> <tyil> 'hello'

[10:29] <AlexDaniel> uhhh‚Ä¶

[10:30] <AlexDaniel> but right, what did I expect :)

[10:30] <AlexDaniel> I mean, I just hate non-puppeted bridging with passion

[10:32] <AlexDaniel> well, federation is even better, of course

[10:32] *** jjmerelo left
[10:32] <tyil> I don't think there's such a setup for Discord to IRC (and vice-versa)

[10:33] <tyil> but it may be a nice project for some people around to make :)

[10:33] *** vivus-ignis joined
[10:33] <tyil> I won't mind running it in my infra if such a project existed, because it would seem nicer to me too

[10:34] *** jjmerelo joined
[10:34] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: I don't think the template might get any better.

[10:35] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: it's good enough.

[10:35] <AlexDaniel> I'm not sure, maybe you can bridge Discord to Matrix

[10:35] <AlexDaniel> and then we'll get everyone natively in the same room :3

[10:35] *** scimon joined
[10:36] <tyil> sounds like it will get increasinly slow to communicate with the Discord people then

[10:36] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: what's the problem with the template?

[10:36] <tyil> Matrix is not known to be a bastion of speed nor stability

[10:37] <AlexDaniel> only if you route it through matrix.org servers

[10:38] <tyil> which is where most channels are, so no matter which server you pick, it's going to route messages through the matrix.org server

[10:39] <AlexDaniel> yes but can you federate with freenode yourself? I'm not sure

[10:39] <tyil> but as I said, if you find (or make) a program that allows for a puppeted bridge, I will gladly host it instead of discord6 :p

[10:39] <AlexDaniel> I don't mind it, I'm just slightly worried because I've seen channels where they have multiple things relayed in that way

[10:40] <AlexDaniel> like discord slack gitter‚Ä¶

[10:40] <tyil> you theoretically can, but from what I've heard from ircops, they'd rather not set up any more Matrix bridges because theyre a massive pain to maintain

[10:40] <AlexDaniel> it just turns into hell on the IRC side, at least for me‚Ä¶

[10:40] <AlexDaniel> tyil: hmm, interesting. I see

[10:41] <AlexDaniel`> test

[10:41] <AlexDaniel> yeah, that takes like 3 seconds

[10:41] <tyil> to arrive at Matrix?

[10:41] <AlexDaniel> from matrix to irc

[10:41] <tyil> ah

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> for some reason it's instant other way

[10:43] <AlexDaniel> anyway, we'll see how it goes :)

[10:44] <jjmerelo> AlexDaniel: knock, knock

[11:38] <AlexDaniel> haha, the way I type right now :D OK time to take a break

[11:41] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Though this looks odd:

[11:41] <jnthn> Module IO::Socket::Async::SSL cannot be installed (InstallableButUntested)

[11:42] <jnthn> So the status is InstallableButUntested and the log below shows it's installed OK, so now does "cannot be installed" describe things?

[11:42] <jnthn> Also the module has tests :)

[11:42] <AlexDaniel> haha!!

[11:46] <jnthn> AlexDaniel: Ah, as I remember it there was a hang resulting from a Rakudo bug that was fixed that it relied on, but I think that was resolved.

[17:52] <jmerelo> Hum, no. That one is redirected to Bailador/Bailador.

[17:53] * ufobat___ is confused

[17:53] <ufobat___> what should i do?

[17:53] <jmerelo> It's probably picking up the CPAN one.

[17:54] <AlexDaniel> I'm also very confused about this

[17:54] <lizmat> jmerelo: perhaps modules like NativeCall should be excluded from the river

[17:54] <ufobat___> is this https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/439 beause of the "same" issue

[17:54] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: perhaps modules like NativeCall should be excluded from the ecosystem :P

[17:54] <ufobat___> there is on on github and one on cpan

[17:54] <ufobat___> but for both ( i assume ) that the github "version" is the same that is on cpan

[17:54] <jmerelo> lizmat: it's interesting to know the score anyway... 

[17:55] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: it's part of rakudo, it shouldn't be in the ecosystem

[19:35] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: I think the meaning of that label is a bit different, although I could be wrong

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> previously we used it when one of the dependencies was preventing the installation of the module

[19:36] <AlexDaniel> I guess the dependency is fine in this case? It's the META6.json that is wrong?

[19:36] <timotimo> right

[19:36] <timotimo> what other label should i have used? :)

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: `PR sent` after you send a PR? :)

[19:37] <timotimo> does blin give programs access to "java"?

[19:37] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: heh‚Ä¶ is there a module that runs java during its testing phase? xD

[19:37] <timotimo> Tika

[19:38] <timotimo> it's a wrapper around a java program

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> interesting. No, I don't think java is available on that server

[19:38] <AlexDaniel> so `works for me` maybe if it works for you?

[19:38] <timotimo> i haven't tested it :P

[19:44] <leszekdubiel> ii  rakudo                            2016.12-1                      all          Perl 6 implementation on top of Moar virtual machine

[19:44] <leszekdubiel> dpkg -l in debian 

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> ahhhhhh that could be it

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> it takes 1.2s on my machine

[19:44] <AlexDaniel> rakudo 2018.12

[19:45] <timotimo> wow that's old :)

[19:45] <leszekdubiel> Ok ... i have tried ubuntu:             ii  rakudo                                     2018.06-1                                     amd64        Perl 6 implementation on top of Moar virtual machine

[19:45] <AlexDaniel> leszekdubiel: people were working really hard on performance in these two years, so that's exactly what I'd expect‚Ä¶

[19:45] <leszekdubiel> it lasts 1 second

[19:45] <leszekdubiel> Wooow! You have made such a bit progress... 

[19:46] <leszekdubiel> Sorry for troubling you with that old software. 

[19:46] <timotimo> i wonder if perl6 should, in its repl, point out if it's older than, say, one year? one and a half years?

[19:47] <leszekdubiel> I won't install any software outside debian repositories on production system. 

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: too late, I don't think it'll be more than twice faster any time soon

[19:47] <leszekdubiel> I hope debian would pull newest version next release cycle. 

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: maybe in some rare cases

[19:47] <AlexDaniel> leszekdubiel: yes, 2018.12 will be part of the next debian release

[19:47] <timotimo> i can imagine that code could be made a bunch faster, too

[19:48] <timotimo> the example code

[19:48] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: but twice faster is perl5-like performance‚Ä¶ hard to beat

[19:49] <leszekdubiel> for users 1.2 seconds or 0.6 seconds doesn't make any difference

[19:49] <AlexDaniel> depends on the amount of data, I guess :)

[19:51] <leszekdubiel> we run perl in our business software for textual data processing and files are no bigger than 100Mb; so I'm happy that newer version is the same magnitude of speed as perl5. 

[19:52] <timotimo> the measurement is pretty noisy on my machine :(

[19:53] <timotimo> time for moarperf to start up (by first recompiling all of cro and its dependencies)

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> leszekdubiel: on average it is still noticeably slower, and there are some rare cases when the performance is really bad

[19:54] <AlexDaniel> leszekdubiel: but yeah, there's progress on this

[19:56] <timotimo> perl -e '$colnum = 900; $rownum = 900; print "column:$_\t" for 1..$colnum; print "\n";  for $r (1..$rownum) { print "data-in-row-$r-col-$_\t" for 1..$colnum; print "\n"; } ' | time perl6  -e 'my @kol = get.split("\t"); .put for lines.hyper(:100batch).map({ (@kol Z .split("\t")).join("\t") });' | wc -l

[19:56] <timotimo> 3.38user 0.12system 0:01.60elapsed 219%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 299712maxresident)k

[19:56] <timotimo> without the .hyper in the middle:

[19:56] <timotimo> 3.04user 0.04system 0:03.04elapsed 101%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 98840maxresident)k

[19:57] <timotimo> that is rather good

[19:59] <leszekdubiel> on my ubuntu:    3.57user 0.08system 0:01.26elapsed 288%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 297688maxresident)k 0inputs+0outputs (0major+73057minor)pagefaults 0swaps

[20:00] <leszekdubiel> without hyper 3 seconds

[20:02] <timotimo> that's even better

[20:07] <leszekdubiel> perl6 is probably cow as perl5... we have had awful experience when string was of length (2**N + 5) then COW stopped working and program instead of few seconds run 40 minutes; 

[20:08] <leszekdubiel> hope perl6 doesn't have many tricks inside that may render it unstable 

[20:08] <timotimo> i'm not sure what exact part would be COW

[23:26] <thundergnat> AlexDaniel: Sorry if I came across as yelling.  I meant that to mean "is there something I can put in the testing to fail early if X11 isn't available and don't bother to try if X11 isn't available", not "don't bother me". :-(

[23:29] <AlexDaniel> thundergnat: it's alright, the situation itself is actually very funny :)

[23:29] <AlexDaniel> this got me thinking‚Ä¶

[23:43] <AlexDaniel> is it possible to have a module named ‚Äò‚Äô (empty string)?

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> just found a module with `"depends": [""]` and am wondering if I can satisfy that dependency :D
