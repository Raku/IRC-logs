[11:48] <samcv> AlexDaniel, i added some comments on this issue, wondered if you minded reading and seeing what you think? or other people that are interested in unicode https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/61

[11:49] <tellable6> 2019-10-19T22:31:50Z #perl6-dev <patrickb> samcv I'd like to know what the problems with relocatability are. I wasn't aware of it not working. Can you elaborate a bit?

[15:20] <AlexDaniel> samcv: I don't understand what problem samemark is trying to solve exactly

[15:20] <AlexDaniel> samcv: like, what's the use case?

[15:20] <AlexDaniel> defining that should help us understand what the behavior should be

[15:21] <AlexDaniel> as I see it, the most common usage is samemark(‘a’)

[15:21] <AlexDaniel> which is an obfuscated way of doing “nomark”

[15:22] <AlexDaniel> if that's the most common usage, then what do people actually expect when doing that?

[15:27] *** wamba joined
[15:28] <AlexDaniel> like, why would you want to distort the original string to remove prepend/extend characters?

[15:46] *** Xliff joined
[15:56] <samcv> AlexDaniel, what is nomark?

[15:56] <samcv> also sorry i don't understand you example for the most common usage

[15:56] <AlexDaniel> samcv: a hypothetical function that people actually need :)

[15:57] <samcv> ah

[15:57] <AlexDaniel> samcv: but yeah, I'm very confused indeed, but I'm just trying to understand what prolbem samemark is actually trying to solve

[15:57] <samcv> well i understood it as copying the "mark"'s of the pattern onto the input string

[15:58] <samcv> greppable6, samemark

[15:59] <samcv> AlexDaniel, uh. you know that corrupted text? samemark would be a perfect application for that

[16:05] <AlexDaniel> samcv: except that I don't think it fully helps

[16:05] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘perḷ6’.samemark(‘a’)

[16:05] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar 2dd570dee: OUTPUT: «perl6␤»

[16:05] <AlexDaniel> oh, maybe it does

[16:06] <AlexDaniel> samcv: so, samemark (or rather, uh, nomark) is a good thing to do unzalgo

[16:06] <samcv> yeah. though you can re-zalgo too by doing the opposite, :P

[16:07] <samcv> but. i guess it's supposed to be a unicode abstraction. where you don't have to care about the internals, you just want it to look the same ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

[16:07] <AlexDaniel> m: say ‘perḷ6’.samemark(‘öõ’)

[16:10] <samcv> hmm

[16:10] <AlexDaniel> that's talking about samecase though

[16:10] <samcv> no. it's just a typo

[16:10] <samcv> both samecase and samemark both say "samecase" in the description
