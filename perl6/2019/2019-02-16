[00:46] <timotimo> i mean that assert looks like libuv isn't happy when you close stdout or stderr? (or stdin for that matter)

[00:46] <timotimo> i wonder what's the intent behind that and what we can do about it

[00:47] <MasterDuke> timotimo: did you try reproing it? i don't get it on head or 2018.12

[00:47] <MasterDuke> but i do on 2018.06

[00:51] <timotimo> wasn't able to either

[00:51] <timotimo> i guess we should have asked for perl6 --version

[12:45] <Xliff> \o/

[12:45] <Xliff> Is there a significant penalty when using a subset of subsets?

[12:45] <Xliff> Particularly if there turns out to be a heirarchy?

[12:46] <lizmat> the biggest penalty is using a constraint consisting of code

[12:46] <timotimo> i would assume it at least has to call each predicate in turn

[12:46] <lizmat> which prevents any fast paths ?

[12:46] <lizmat> afk&

[14:08] <tbrowder> i’m having a real head scratcher with a class i am building. i cannot figure why i get this error: Cannot look up attributes in a My::Class object...

[14:08] <Altreus> araraloren: I'm on 2018.10. Is there a later version?

[14:09] <araraloren> I don't know, Rakudo last release is 2018-12, not know the Rakudo Star

[14:10] <tbrowder> my attributes are all $. or %., i am using a TWEAK submethod where i modify the attributes, all the attrs i tweak are marked “is rw”

[14:10] <Altreus> I'm on the top level of perl6 involvement :) i.e. I do what perl6.org says, and ask for help when it doesn't work

[14:11] <tbrowder> i am calling on some other package vars in the tweak

[14:11] <Altreus> can I just install rakudo from github over the top of waht rakudo star gave me?

[14:11] <Altreus> tbrowder: don't forget TWEAK requires you to use $! or %!

[15:50] <tbrowder> guifa: i wasn’t aware of that module...let me check...CLDR

[15:51] *** cpan-p6 left
[15:51] <guifa> It’s not a perl module, but a large database of language information.  To my knowledge the most anyone has done with it in P6 is to implement a list formatter

[15:52] <timotimo> tbrowder: did you see my hint?

[15:52] * guifa . o O ( actually wouldn’t be a terrible thing to have as a built in in the same way all of Unicode’s stuff is built in)

[15:56] <tbrowder> timotimo: arg! i thought i had a new in that ex*/eg3.p6 file! so much for single-set eyeballs, and too much late nighting! thanks!

[16:02] <tbrowder> guifa: it might be useful later, but at the rate i’m not debugging successfully, it might be a LONG while!

[16:03] <guifa> I will probably look at tackling CLDR at some point, I’m going to have to implement its date and number functions for the Fluent localization framework

[18:02] <guifa> tbrowder: when you download the common.zip file from CLDR, go to common/main/[languagecode].xml   In that XML file, inside the <date> tag (top level tag) with how each language should format all the different calenders (not just gregorian), interval ranges, names of months years (even cycles of the chinese calendar!)

[18:04] *** AlexDani` joined
[18:04] <guifa> Go to date -> calendars -> calendar type=gregorian -> months  and you can see the different abbreviated names of months.  For instance “abbreviated” (three letters), “narrow” (single), “wide” (spelled out) for use in compounds, or for when standing alone

[18:05] *** AlexDaniel left
[18:06] <tbrowder> aha! an unknown treasure trove now revealed. that needs to be in the README, and in its tags. I hope I’m not wasting my time with Date::Names.

[18:07] <tbrowder> guifa: thanks for the info

[18:09] *** joy_ joined
[18:09] <guifa> I only knew about it because I’ve done some work with a team that submitted the information for Asturian.  It’s a bit more obscure I think that it should be.  But I don’t think you’d be wasting your time.  Some times it can be good to have a more surgically precise and tailored module than a blunt force mega module ;-)

[20:21] <timotimo> details please :)

[20:21] <andrzejku> when I add a libdir to moarvm

[20:22] <andrzejku> it looks like the generated moar binary

[20:22] <andrzejku> have not a properly set runtime path for /usr/lib64/perl6/libmoarvm.so

[20:22] <andrzejku> or something ismilar

[20:22] <andrzejku> so I set LDCONFIG but is more like a hack

[23:10] <timotimo> andrzejku: If you're submitting a package.yml build, ensure you also commit the pspec_$ARCH.xml file, as builds are created from git tags.

[23:10] <timotimo> is that relevant to your ticket?

[23:10] <timotimo> i can't find the documentation for the package.yml files

[23:11] <timotimo> aha, it's called ypkg

[23:13] <timotimo> i think the summary field in the packages should have what's currently in the description and have a bit more explanations in the description field. for example, it'd be helpful to have the description of moarvm (or maybe even the summary) reference rakudo/perl6

[23:57] <timotimo> are you using system libraries?

[23:57] <timotimo> we have (and require/rely upon) patches to libtommath
