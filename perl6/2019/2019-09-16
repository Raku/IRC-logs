[07:05] <abraxxa> sena_kun: Hi! paged works halfway, the control I get back from the ldap server after the first search always has size 0

[07:06] <sena_kun> abraxxa, but is the cookie present?

[07:06] <tellable6> 2019-09-16T01:40:52Z #perl6 <DrForr> sena_kun Following the official (changed) installation instructions - the new invocation is 'npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core', don't know how far it'll go.

[07:06] <abraxxa> sena_kun: it seems so

[07:07] <sena_kun> abraxxa, 0 as size is normal and server may do so if they can't estimate, at least the RFC says so

[07:07] <sena_kun> abraxxa, so you just iterate as long as there is a cookie to work with

[07:07] <abraxxa> sena_kun: but then the loop ends

[07:07] <discord6> <Aearnus> abraxxa: Perl 6 should tell you the correct name of array.elems if you accidently put any of those other names

[07:07] <sena_kun> abraxxa, how so? it shouldn't unless the cookie length is zero

[07:08] <abraxxa> I missed the loop { in my code

[07:08] <abraxxa> last unless $control.cookie.elems; doesn't seem to check if its inside a loop

[07:10] <sena_kun> m: last if 42;

[07:10] <evalable6> sena_kun, rakudo-moar b55b85aef: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) ===SORRY!===␤last without loop construct␤»

[07:10] <sena_kun> maybe something else was related

[07:11] <abraxxa> sometimes it works, sometimes it stops after the first search already

[07:12] <abraxxa> it stops when cookie => Blob.new()

[07:12] <abraxxa> so when the cookie is empty

[07:13] <abraxxa> the control-value is way shorter when that happens but I guess you extract the cookie from the control-value

[07:13] <sena_kun> yes

[21:04] <Doc_Holliwood> what it does is, it has a bunch of unit classes like Units::Watt that have a symbol attribute, which gets exported so you can write "120W" and get an class Units::Watt with a value of 120

[21:06] <guifa> Someone else recently had one like that too, I was going to add on operators for them all for the module

[21:07] <Doc_Holliwood> also: ok( 8A * 2Ω = 20V ); does work

[21:10] <guifa> Although looking at how both of y’all’s modules have been done internally, I may actually write a third one based on the work that I’ve been doing with CLDR.  Maybe overkill, but better to have leaner ones like yours for normal stuff and a heavier one for when localization stuff is necessary

[21:17] <guifa> Intl::Units and Units::* 

[21:17] <guifa> (or even Intl::CLDR::Units, I’m not 100% on my final organization of CLDR data yet)

[21:19] <guifa> It’s unfortunately going to be a hot minute before I can delve back into the CLDR package because dissertation deadlines, but when I do I’ll do a mock up of a module with, say, just lengths, and then see how to merge that into Units::*

[21:27] *** also is now known as guifa

[21:27] <guifa> Such a ruined joke

[21:37] <Xliff> Wha? wazzis about bits? Are them those polygons that get spikey when they go "NO!" ?

[21:39] <Xliff> Doc_Holliwood: That's a bit funny. I was just looking at that module recently. Don't know if it's still being actively worked on.

[21:39] <Xliff> I do have the afforementioned bit, so if a collab is in the works, I'm game.

[21:39] <Xliff> Still. An attempt to notify the maintainer would be appreciated.

[21:44] <Doc_Holliwood> That would be me

[21:44] <Doc_Holliwood> I got ... side trackes

[21:44] <Doc_Holliwood> tracked*

[21:44] <Xliff> Ah.

[21:44] <Xliff> So what's up?

[21:45] <Xliff> (I got side-tracked too... see my pinned projects on GitHub)

[21:47] <guifa> Xliff: convo just picked up because I was looking at someone else’s module and was looking to add in operators so that 1kg + 500m returns 1.5kg etc.  D_H has a similar module. I think it might be nice to eventually get a localized units module.  The CLDR has tons of related data

[21:48] <guifa> (for example https://github.com/holli-holzer/perl6-Units/blob/master/lib/Units/Acre.pm6 has attributes for singular, plural, and symbol, and would be cool to have an ability to link that to CLDR to provide single/dual/plural/paucel/etc with long short narrow forms)

[22:01] <Doc_Holliwood> I see. It would be a good idea then to rename the stringy methods of unit (and add some) methods to `Units::Unit` then.

[22:02] <Doc_Holliwood> I'm tired. That shows in broken sentences like the former. But you got me.

[22:03] * Doc_Holliwood hits the sack

[22:05] <vrurg> AlexDaniel: beer with rakish? ;)

[22:06] *** pmurias left
[22:07] <AlexDaniel> guifa: it wasn't exactly registered, it was a misfeature in the previous bot that allowed to send to nonexistent names

[22:07] <AlexDaniel> guifa: tellable6 acquired the db of the previous bot, so now it thinks that “also” was a real nickname

[22:08] <Xliff> guifa: OK, then it sounds like you are on.

[22:08] <Xliff> Let me know if you need any help.

[22:11] * guifa has a lot of ideas for using the CLDR stuff

[22:11] <guifa> Like exporting a regex for units

[22:11] *** Sgeo joined
[22:12] <guifa> my $foo /… <unit(:length)>…/

[22:12] <guifa> “blah blah blah 5km blah blah blah” ~~ $foo

[22:13] <guifa> could match 5km and maybe even offer up an action for turning it into a unit

[22:24] <cpan-p6> New module released to CPAN! Prometheus::Client (0.0.1) by 03HANENKAMP

[23:01] <Xliff> guifa: Keep me posted on the progess. I kinda like the idea of a module that would work with Units::SI and offer localized alternatives!

[23:02] <guifa> Xliff: this is more long term planning / ideas.  I’m in a crunch period with the PhD :-( 

[23:02] * guifa grumbles about javascript being horrid and annoying and not liking it at all lol

[23:04] <Xliff> hhahahaha! I totally agree, guifa
