[00:00] <timotimo> but this also means that if i have the hash from the filename, i can't differentiate between released versions of a module and unreleased local modifications, right? since the file contents don't enter into it?

[00:00] <timotimo> though i guess for many installed ones i get :auth<cpan:...>

[00:01] <timotimo> whereas the auth for non-released ones tends to be :auth<github:...>

[00:01] <timotimo> nadim_: i don't know what that is

[00:01] <nadim_> pack everything in an executable archive, perl 6, scripts, modules, data, ...

[00:02] <ugexe> to calculate the sha1 you do  nqp::sha1('lib/Relative/Path/Name.pm6' ~ $foo), where $foo is $.id from https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/89f8f6046eade25a34c211321a88b105469b4f5a/src/core/Distribution.pm6#L56-L65

[00:02] <nadim_> https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PAR/lib/PAR/Tutorial.pod

[00:02] *** mowcat joined
[00:03] <timotimo> ugexe: hum. i'd have liked there to be a separator between the path name and the $.id, or perhaps sha1 them recursively

[00:03] <timotimo> i.e. instead of sha1($foo ~ $bar) we'd do sha1(sha1($foo) ~ $bar)

[00:03] <ugexe> Goofus installs his unreleased local modifications without bumping the version. Galant uses -I. or bumps the version.

[00:04] <ugexe> yeah that'd be great, except it wasn't done like that to begin with. so you'd have o write something to upgrade all existing sha1 using stuff

[00:04] <timotimo> right, that problem ...

[00:05] *** moony left
[00:06] <ugexe> also its already sha1($foo ~ sha1($bar))

[00:06] <timotimo> oh, it is?

[00:06] <timotimo> sorry about that, then

[00:21] <nadim_> I have the weirdes peoblem, one that has been bugging me all afternoon, I have a script that uses DDT, and it shows some dd output, but there is no dd call!

[00:21] <nadim_> I did have that yesterday but removed it.

[00:22] <nadim_> I got tired so I removed the whole DDT module ... and the script still works! where does it find the librry?!!!

[00:22] <nadim_> ugexe: any idea? I have removed all .precompiled I know of

[00:22] <ugexe> what do you mean "removed the whole DDT module". be more specific

[00:22] <timotimo> you can use "RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG" in the environment to find out where it's looking

[00:23] <nadim_> ugexe: i move DDT in another file so the script would fail, and it doesn't

[00:24] <ugexe> you have to be more specific still

[00:24] <ugexe> what file exactly did you move

[00:25] <nadim_> lib/Data/Dump/Tree.pm to somewhere else

[00:25] <ugexe> what is the exact command you are invoking your script that uses lib/Data/Dump/Tree.pm ?

[00:26] <nadim_> perl6 -Ilib,t example/script.pl

[00:27] *** epony joined
[00:28] <nadim_> itseems to me that thescript load from the cache (/home/nadim/.perl6/precom) even the module has changed, or is not there at all

[00:28] <ugexe> the precomp from that file will be in lib/.precomp

[00:29] <ugexe> otherwise it may be loading some old installed version, which would be apparent with `zef locate Data::Dump::Tree`

[00:30] <nadim_> there is no lib/.precomp

[00:30] <ugexe> there will be if you run the command you pasted

[00:31] <timotimo> oh i didn't know you can put a , there

[00:33] <timotimo> bedtime!

[00:33] <ugexe> otherwise follow timotimo advice and run your script with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG, then grep through the wall of text to find the file being loaded

[00:33] *** epony left
[00:34] <nadim_> ugexe: you're righ, there's a shebang inthe scrip I didn't always run it the same way

[07:14] <holyghost> Kaiepi, I want to start the perl6 pkg for netbsd, I've not come around to doing anything due to work but if you can send me a tarball with pkgsrc Makefiles, patches etc, I might put it in

[07:16] <holyghost> I'm on their mailing list, openbsd ports should be the same as netbsd AFAIK, so it'd be done in a jiffy

[07:16] <Kaiepi> aight

[07:18] *** Manifest0 joined
[07:18] <holyghost> Problem is, I don't have a x86_64, I only have i386 netbsd

[07:19] <holyghost> Then I have a amd64 openbsd 5.7 on a macbook

[07:19] <holyghost> and a i386 freebsd on a dell

[07:20] <holyghost> I might only be interested in the netbsd though, as I don't have the time or the courage to develop much just for maintenance

[07:21] <holyghost> I don't have the money for new machines, 64 bit I mean

[07:22] <holyghost> I sold my SGI O2 and Indy, if I can find another machine I'd be interested to port perl6 to IRIX (or SGI's linux e.g. debian)

[07:22] <holyghost> IRIX is a freebsd or 4.4 bsd derived

[07:24] <holyghost> IRIX has a gnu c compiler (gcc) 

[07:24] <holyghost> I tried to port perl6 to MacOS X PPC but that didn't go well

[07:26] <holyghost> PPC = IBM's powerpc

[07:26] <holyghost> used in a GameCube, Nintendo Wii, and WiiU

[07:27] <holyghost> Then later on I'll try to load an OS on my G5 Mac and try again to work on it for the perlmongers

[07:27] <holyghost> It's a small niche though

[07:28] <holyghost> since G5 is 64 bit, perl6 might work better although it might need headers from something else

[07:29] <holyghost> I know you just walk into another OS with perl6 but people should keep it portable C so you can load it on other machines

[07:30] <holyghost> The gcc master holds the key to it I presume

[07:32] <holyghost> *I know you don't just walk

[10:48] <holyghost> I remember I descended into Ultima 6 dragon dungeons with "Heirate Mich" from Rammstein on my headphones

[10:49] <holyghost> I'll make some good dungeons for my game systems

[10:49] <holyghost> dungeon == Master Tower in Hollandaise

[10:50] <holyghost> of a castle I presume

[10:51] <Kaiepi> i remember grinding for weeks in ffii for the best magic

[10:51] <Kaiepi> i learned nothing

[10:51] <Kaiepi> besides that i'm a masochist

[10:52] <holyghost> "Heirate mich" is a song from the movie "Lost Highhway", film album

[10:52] <holyghost> libffi ?

[10:52] <Kaiepi> no, final fantasy 2

[10:52] <Kaiepi> it's by far the hardest in the series

[10:53] <holyghost> I have it on PSP

[10:53] <holyghost> It's a very cool game

[10:53] <Kaiepi> funny you do the same thing i do though, i associate certain songs with what i was doing at the time

[10:53] <holyghost> sure

[10:53] <holyghost> You have to dungeoneer with music, I guess

[10:53] <Kaiepi> the later versions aren't as hard

[10:53] <Kaiepi> i played the famicom version

[10:54] <holyghost> I gave my PS3 FF13 to my girls

[10:54] <Kaiepi> luckily there's a bug where if you select a spell and cancel 100 times in a row in a battle you instantly level up that spell

[10:54] <holyghost> I don;t know the SNES/Super Nintendo/Famicom versiob

[10:54] <Kaiepi> it's mostly the same, just missing some extra items

[10:54] <holyghost> sure, NES and SNES have those easter eggs

[10:54] <Kaiepi> and bug fixes

[10:55] <holyghost> I am preparing my combat systems with one of FF2

[10:56] <holyghost> And, for you elder gamers, Quest for Glory (also Hero's Quest)

[10:56] <holyghost> I need to sub/super system modularize it

[10:57] <holyghost> There's also Darkside Chronicles on Windows Store, it's the same system more or less

[10:57] <holyghost> It's a free game from M$

[11:00] <holyghost> or it's named Heroes of Larkwood, I don't remember

[11:00] <holyghost> I write games, I don't play them

[11:02] <holyghost> As a solo designer/gfx/programmer you cannot just work out current games, e.g. I write them mostly in 2D

[11:03] <Kaiepi> the only game i've written is a trivia plugin for a chat website

[11:03] <holyghost> I hope Xliff can help out with the system, he's sleeping now, so don't wake the dragon :-)

[11:03] <Kaiepi> i find writing games tedious

[11:03] <holyghost> tedious ?

[11:03] <Kaiepi> well, a lot of work

[11:03] <holyghost> I know my CSS3 games too

[11:03] <Kaiepi> the trivia plugin wasn't but...

[11:04] <holyghost> I see

[11:04] <holyghost> It's indeed sped up with programming them

[11:04] <holyghost> You just don't program them fully featured without hard work

[11:05] <holyghost> You miss stuff, although there's perl sotware for easily programming game scenarios

[11:05] <holyghost> Then again, I almost always start from scratch with a system I found in 2003

[11:06] <holyghost> *I found out myself in 2002

[11:06] <holyghost> It's a simple program but you can do lots of stuff fast

[11:11] <holyghost> Anyway, start dungeoneering with Rock music or something on your headphones of your CDROM/computer

[11:12] <holyghost> You have to go into Dark Wave for that, for example :-)

[11:12] <holyghost> "Save Me" from Suicide Commando (a Belgian artist) might do the trick

[11:20] <holyghost> I also like "Feuer Frei" from Rammstein, the dungeoneering music is legio these days

[11:23] <holyghost> Blood, violence and Perl :-)

[11:28] <holyghost> I'm going to do some good dungeoneering in PaganVisions2 (it does _not_ compile right now), with FF and QFG systems, I hope to incorporate several game subsystems and mix them for game dev

[11:28] *** dolmen joined
[11:28] * holyghost is a bit drunk on fridays

[11:29] <holyghost> If you look at http://github.com/theholyghost2/PaganVisions2, there's a MILESTONES.txt in it

[11:29] <holyghost> I hope to extend it to 3D sometime

[11:30] <holyghost> The game subsystems need to become driven by the AI subsystems

[11:30] *** noisegul joined
[11:30] <holyghost> There's also a TODO.txt

[11:31] <holyghost> Most simple game systems cover 2D as well as 3D, e.g. by collision detection

[11:31] <holyghost> It's lots of work but it's not difficult if you simplify several

[11:32] <holyghost> It held onto Linux and Cairo(1-2) for dev with Xliff of that gfx subsystem

[11:33] <holyghost> he's offline now, maybe next week can debug the gfx subsystems

[11:33] <holyghost> *we can

[11:34] <holyghost> Then I'm going to use rpgrevolution.com and opengameart.org gfx

[11:34] <holyghost> and my own

[11:34] *** noisegul left
[11:34] <holyghost> It needs things like a priest/wizard spellbook, widget tree, you design game widgets in a graphical way such as smalltalk morphs

[11:35] <holyghost> not just rectangled widgets such as buttons

[11:35] <holyghost> It's better IMO to use a graphics system such as Cairo or SDL2 to develop widgets

[11:51] <nadim_> holyghost: I am sure you can put all this in a nice blog and just past a link.

[11:53] <holyghost> I had a blog once, it's on http://thediaryofelvishhealer.blogspot.com

[11:53] <holyghost> I speak through my code, I'll make some nice docs as you say, for it

[11:54] *** lgandras joined
[11:55] <holyghost> I hope to incorporate all major game systems in my PaganVisions2, with explanation in test dir and pod6

[11:55] <holyghost> the tests will be somewhat heavyweight by all means

[11:55] *** lgandras_ joined
[11:56] <holyghost> Larry is probably going to call me onto making extra modules for PaganVisions2

[11:57] <holyghost> PaganVisions2 is monolithic now

[11:57] <holyghost> although it will be a modular system, meaning it has game subsystems which are worked out on their own, compile on their own and test on their own

[11:58] <holyghost> People can always contact me for further development

[11:58] *** lgandras left
[11:59] <holyghost> As I said before, I want Xliff to debug the Cairo backend then move on with the SDL2 backend and then code game subsystems

[12:00] <holyghost> Kaiepi, if you have a tarball of your openbsd port, do tell me 

[12:00] <holyghost> then I'll make a netbsd version

[12:01] <Kaiepi> i haven't started it yet

[12:01] <holyghost> If I find the time

[12:01] <holyghost> ok

[12:01] <Kaiepi> i'll get started on it once i finish working on this small project

[12:01] <holyghost> Kaiepi : in debian there's modules as packages

[12:02] <holyghost> so p6-JSON-Fast for example

[12:02] <holyghost> I hope o/n/bsd can figure that out for themselves with zef

[12:03] <holyghost> It's enormous work

[12:03] <holyghost> *an enormous

[12:12] <nadim_> a perl 5 question but I'll need to know for Perl 6 too, when setting the record separator to "",  is it possible to know what was read in the recod separator, ie: how many lines?

[12:13] *** lgandras_ left
[12:15] <timotimo> nadim_: i'm not sure i understand what you mean; does setting the record separator to "" give you one byte per record or something?

[12:17] <holyghost> Kaiepi : do you know already if a perl5 ./Configure would work in the distro of a ports/pkgsrc of perl6 ?

[12:17] <nadim_> timotimo: given a RS = "", $_ will contain the paragraph but I want toknow how much of thetext was eaten by the record separator

[12:18] <nadim_> timotimo: not sure you've seen it but you :does[MyCustomSetup] is on github

[12:18] <timotimo> i saw it, but i didn't look at it in detail

[12:18] <timotimo> i don't think perl6 supports a record separator of ""

[12:19] <tyil> the link for "

[12:19] <holyghost> Kaiepi : that's one of the troubles I ran into, by compiling perl5 for a perl6 package

[13:19] <timotimo> instead of the subst, a trans might be good

[13:35] *** Manifest0 joined
[13:37] <Kaypie> is there a way to speed up precompilation? on one of my modules it can take 5-10 minutes to finish

[13:39] *** Manifest0 left
[13:40] <timotimo> you can start by checking what RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG says what it does, is it rebuilding more than you think it should?

[13:43] *** AlexDaniel joined
[13:44] *** Manifest0 joined
[13:51] <ugexe> just reduce the amount of code that needs to be precompiled

[13:54] <ugexe> i dont think it matter if its rebuilding more than one thinks it should... whats the alternative

[13:55] <ugexe> lets say you find out it is rebuilding more than you think. you could try and make it smarter, but i'm not sure how you do that since you must run the code to pull in further dependencies. additionally the order is now sorted so that reproducible builds can happen

[13:57] <Kaypie> it's recompiling modules that have never been changed

[13:57] <timotimo> "no precompilation;"?

[13:57] <ugexe> if the repo-id changes then they must be reprecompiled

[13:57] <ugexe> the repo-id off a -I. or -Ilib will if the source of any files change

[13:58] <ugexe> s/will/will change/

[13:58] <ugexe> s/off/of/

[13:59] <ugexe> same as if you bumped the version of a distribution and installed it (it doesn't not precompile stuff that didnt change from the last version)

[13:59] <Kaypie> ohhhhhh

[13:59] <Kaypie> so it's -Ilib that's the problem

[13:59] <timotimo> there's a simple solution

[13:59] <timotimo> split every file into a separate folder structure and add lots of -I

[13:59] <timotimo> hold on, the repo id also contains the next-in-chain's repo id, no?

[14:00] <ugexe> yes, so you would need to use the same order of lib folders

[14:00] <ugexe> every time

[14:00] <timotimo> well, that's the easy part

[14:01] <timotimo> but whenever one of them has a file in it that changes, everything "above" that will rebuild?

[14:01] <ugexe> yeah

[14:02] <Kaypie> in lib i have a plugins and games directory

[14:02] <Kaypie> i'm planning on moving more code over to them so i can have more pure code

[14:02] <timotimo> well, if you've got 20 files and are planning to only work on a single one of them for the next few days, it could help to split 1 vs 19

[14:40] <patrickb> Is it true that the need to recompile is to some extent related to the hard linking of compilation units that moarvm does? I.e. if we'd manage to decouple the compiled files via more intelligent linking we'd need to recompile less?

[14:40] <patrickb> I remember a discussion of mst and jnthn a while ago...

[14:43] <ugexe> i think the killer is how to handle e.g. `augment Test { ... }` when Test has already been used somewhere else earlier

[14:45] <jnthn> patrickb: It only does that because there isn't any absolute naming, which would be needed for dynamic linking.

[14:47] <patrickb> Is dynamic linking an achievable goal? Or architecturally unfeasable?

[14:47] <patrickb> Kind of sounds like a potential GSoC project...

[14:47] <jnthn> I've no idea how it'd be achieved.

[14:48] <jnthn> Or a potential PhD project :P

[16:20] <Kaiepi> they're nowhere near as bad as js proxies, i don't get why i can never remember not to use methods for FETCH/STORE

[16:20] <AlexDaniel> proxies*

[16:20] <Kaiepi> i've only used them a couple times

[18:43] <chakli> Is there a way to profile Grammar and action? I have a grammar that runs over a file thats around 30 mb and it usually take a minute and half to parse. I

[18:44] <timotimo> yeah, the profiler can do that

[18:47] <chakli> perl6 --profile ? I did try that but it generated a 150 MB html file! Any hints what I should look out for?

[18:48] <timotimo> oof. yeah, in that case you'll have to use the sql output and explore that with moarperf

[18:52] *** ravenousmoose left
[18:54] <chakli> Ok, ill try that

[18:54] <chakli> I also notices that GC took ~38% time

[18:54] <chakli> is that normal?

[18:55] <timotimo> it can be, depends on a lot of factors

[18:55] <timotimo> roughly, the more objects survive, the longer it takes and the more inter-object references there are, the longer it takes

[18:57] <chakli> RES memory was around 160MB on top but VIRT went upto 20GB

[18:57] <timotimo> i'm not sure what kinds of stuff moar does that brings virt memory up a lot without using res

[18:58] <timotimo> but normally big amounts of virt are no problem

[18:58] <chakli> Also i read the file like 'file'.IO.lines.map({ ...parsng code... })

[18:58] <chakli> not sure if that might be the bottleneck

[18:58] *** ravenousmoose joined
[18:59] <timotimo> the shorter the lines, the higher the overhead from mapping, but it shouldn't be terribly slow

[18:59] <timotimo> oh, grammars also have quite a bit of overhead for startup and finishing, which is also not great for very short lines

[19:00] <chakli> ah, they are short lines around 160 characters/line

[19:00] <timotimo> ah i was thinking more like 5 characters

[19:01] <chakli> but even with ~200/lines its around 150,000 lines

[19:08] <chakli> If probably Grammar is the reason i can probably use grep to filter the lines first

[20:10] <nadim_> ugexe: yes, thank you but I would have liked to know where it is installed

[20:10] *** Rocco joined
[20:10] <nadim_> for science

[20:10] <ugexe> zef locate "Some::Module:ver<...>" i would guess

[20:11] <nadim_> we discussed this yesterday, I though I had dd somewhere in my code but it is in the installed version not my dev one

[20:11] *** robertle left
[20:11] <nadim_> hmm, how do I know what version of the module gets loaded? I have no idea which one wasinstalled

[20:11] <ugexe> zef locate doesn't work with versions yet it seems

[20:11] *** Rocco left
[20:12] *** dolmen joined
[20:12] <ugexe> run your script with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1

[20:12] <ugexe> it will output a wall of text

[20:12] <ugexe> but you can use that to determine exactly which files were loaded

[20:13] <ugexe> perl6 -e 'say $*REPO.resolve(CompUnit::DependencySpecification.new(:short-name<Zef>)).distribution'

[20:14] <ugexe> that will show you which version of zef gets loaded for just `use Zef;`

[20:14] <ugexe> perl6 -e 'say $*REPO.resolve(CompUnit::DependencySpecification.new(:short-name<Zef>)).distribution.meta'

[20:14] <nadim_> zef locate says which version! cool,  From Distribution: Data::Dump::Tree:ver<1.8.0>:auth<github:nkh>:api<>

[20:14] <ugexe> zef list --installed will show you all installed modules and all their versions as well

[20:15] <nadim_> good to know too

[20:15] *** Manifest0 joined
[20:16] <nadim_> is there a completion file for zef somewhere?

[21:12] <ToddAndMargo> Anyone on newbie duty?

[21:14] <ToddAndMargo> Question: is there a way to tripper parent directory creation with `mkdir` as does bash `mkdir --parents xxx`?  https://docs.perl6.org/routine/mkdir is beyond confusing

[21:14] <ToddAndMargo> trigger not tripper

[21:15] <alexghacker> That doc says: "Also creates parent directories, as needed (similar to *nix utility mkdir with -p option); that is, mkdir "foo/bar/ber/meow" will create foo, foo/bar, and foo/bar/ber directories if they do not exist, as well as foo/bar/ber/meow."

[21:17] <alexghacker> If it's failing then there's a bug in either the doc or the implementation

[21:17] <alexghacker> (I have no idea which)

[21:17] <alexghacker> if, on the other hand, you're just not seeing the directories you expect then maybe your code isn't executing where you think it is?

[21:19] <ToddAndMargo> I did a search in page an could not fid that verbage, but it did show on Google short discription.  And I found that I had a file called "a" which was what I used as a parent.  So "short between the headsets"

[21:19] <ToddAndMargo> # p6 'mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766";' Failed to create directory '/home/linuxutil/a/b/c, 0o766' with mode '0o777': Failed to mkdir: Not a directory   in block <unit> at -e line 1

[21:19] <alexghacker> are we looking at the same https://docs.perl6.org/routine/mkdir ?

[21:19] <ToddAndMargo> could be a little more explanitory

[21:20] <ugexe> well, its telling you what is happening already

[21:20] <alexghacker> perhaps the error message was just LTA

[21:20] <ugexe> you are trying to create a path '/home/linuxutil/a/b/c, 0o766', including command and space

[21:21] <ToddAndMargo> no, googel popped me over to https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO.html and I did not realize it.  Showed correctly o the hits page, which was weird.

[21:21] <ugexe> mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766"; -- i mean how the hell can the compiler know that you didnt mean that nonsensical path

[21:22] <ugexe> mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766"; is NOT the same as mkdir "a/b/c", 0o766;

[21:23] <ugexe> and the error is telling you everything you need to know to figure that out already

[21:23] <ToddAndMargo> not sure what yo mean.  My mistake was that I had an "a" file (not directory) alrady existing

[21:24] <ugexe> read what you pasted

[21:24] <ugexe> the code

[21:24] *** dolmen joined
[21:24] <ToddAndMargo> bash does a nice error report:  `touch a; mkdir -p a/b/c`   

[21:24] <ToddAndMargo> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘a’: Not a directory

[21:24] <ugexe> you are trying to create a file called "a/b/c, 0o766". The error explicitly tells you this, and also that it is using mode 0o777 which is not what you were trying to do

[21:25] <ToddAndMargo> Could we have something like that in p6?

[21:25] <Kaiepi> moarvm's openbsd port is just about ready! just two more to go

[21:26] <ToddAndMargo> I was trying to create parents directories a, a/b, then a/b/c.  It crashed because I already had an "a" file.  I was not trying to create a file.  I am confused as to your question

[21:27] <ugexe> i dont have any questions. i was pointing out what is wrong with everything you are doing.

[21:28] <ToddAndMargo> I do realize what I did wrong, now.  Did I do somethign else wrong as well?

[21:29] <ugexe> ToddAndMargo>	# p6 'mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766";' Failed to create directory '/home/linuxutil/a/b/c, 0o766' with mode '0o777': 

[21:29] <ugexe> you are passing ONE argument to mkdir

[21:29] <ugexe> you should be passing TWO arguments to mkdir (if you want to use mode 0o766)

[21:29] <ugexe> the error message explains everything. look at the name of the directory it is trying to create

[21:30] <ToddAndMargo> As soon as I deleted the file called "a", this worked perfectly `p6 'mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766";'`   I am confused by your statement.

[21:31] <timotimo> that's a very strange name for a folder

[21:31] <ToddAndMargo> oh I see.  I created a fiel called 0o766

[21:31] *** natrys left
[21:31] <timotimo> no, you created a folder named "c, 0o766"

[21:31] <ToddAndMargo> I was trying to set attributes

[21:32] <ToddAndMargo> how would you modfiy my line to get the attributes (mode)?

[21:32] <ugexe> ugexe>	mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766"; is NOT the same as mkdir "a/b/c", 0o766;

[21:33] *** AlexDaniel left
[21:33] <ugexe> i gave you the answer 10 minutes ago

[21:35] <ToddAndMargo> Please understand that I can be dense as a rock at times.    `p6 'mkdir ("a/b/c", 0o766);'` does look like two paramters to me.  Would you mind modifying my line so I can see exactly what I am doing wrong?

[21:35] <ugexe> ...that is not the code you posted before

[21:35] <ugexe> ToddAndMargo>	# p6 'mkdir "a/b/c, 0o766";

[21:35] <ToddAndMargo> give the same error.  

[21:35] <ugexe> that is ONE argument

[21:36] <ugexe> no it doesnt

[21:36] <ToddAndMargo> you are correct.  I though I saw what I saw.  Thank you!

[21:39] <ToddAndMargo> I kept seeing `"a/b/c", 0o766` when it was `"a/b/c, 0o766"`;  the 0o766 is a Samba specifiy attribute

[21:43] <timotimo> could it be you have very mild dislexia and could benefit from a font specifically made to help dislexic people read stuff more easily?

[21:44] *** AlexDaniel joined
[21:45] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: thank you especially for taking a look ♥

[21:46] <ToddAndMargo> Hi Timo,  I am not dislexic.  I am "weird".  There is a difference.  Dislexic folks don't reach for the salt when they want the pepper

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> :)

[21:53] <Altreus> Is there a variable containing the current package name?

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> m: say $*PACKAGE

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «Dynamic variable $*PACKAGE not found␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> m: say $?PACKAGE

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar a643b8be1: OUTPUT: «(GLOBAL)␤»

[21:58] <AlexDaniel> this?

[22:02] <nadim_> ugexe: a simple comletion for zef in the meantime https://gist.github.com/nkh/68c8462f170fadfeb216e7578447a3af

[22:04] <nadim_> I haven't found how to pass --/option to bash yet

[22:08] *** dolmen left
[22:10] *** johnjohn101 left
[22:10] <ugexe> if you wanted to get extra fancy it'd look at the zef config and add options for every field called `short-name` such as https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/e73897378b36cbf53f2ed8d98363d94bac70767d/resources/config.json#L33

[22:10] <ugexe> --<short-name> to enable any of them, and --/<short-name> to disable any of them

[22:11] <ugexe> so some shmuck might have a custom config with or without everything in the base config

[22:15] <ugexe> perl6 -e 'use Zef::Config; say Zef::Config::parse-file(Zef::Config::guess-path).values.grep(* ~~ Array).map(*.Slip).grep({.<short-name>:exists}).map({.<short-name>})'

[22:15] <ugexe> that will get you a list of all the options from the config

[22:15] *** rindolf left
[22:15] <nadim_> arent't those in the help enough?

[22:16] <nadim_> I very rarely use zef, except for install,like 3 times the last days and never before

[22:17] <ugexe> dunno, i dont use tab completion

[22:17] <nadim_> are those short names commands or options?

[22:17] <ugexe> options

[22:18] <nadim_> I'll add them, update the gist and then you and I can forget about them :)

[22:18] <Altreus> AlexDaniel: ah that's it, thanks

[22:19] <Altreus> SmokeMachine: what have I done wrong? A model cannot have attributes, but you tried to declare '$!student-email'

[22:19] <Altreus> has Str $!student-email is referencing{ :model<Student>, :column<email> }

[22:25] <ingy> nadim_: I'll have completion for zef ready for yapc :)

[22:28] <ToddAndMargo> this stopped working on me after upgrading to Fedora 30 from 28.  "Malformed UTF-8"

[22:28] <ToddAndMargo>  @LogFiles = @LogFiles.sort: {my ($month, $day, $year, $hour, $minute, $second) =         .comb(/\d+/);($year // 0, $month // 0, $day // 0, $hour // 0, $minute // 0,$second // 0, $_);}

[22:29] <ToddAndMargo> And it only bombs if there are more than one entry in @LogFiles

[22:29] <ToddAndMargo> entries look like this: /home/tony/Documents/CimTrak/logs/cimtrak.log.06-07-2019_15:21:12.zip

[23:29] <Kaiepi> the version of libuv it has is too old

[23:30] <ToddAndMargo> This did the trick. I added .Str to $F  `for dir $ZipCimLogPath -> $F { push @Files, $F.Str; }`;  Some weirdness with Fedora 390 upgrade

[23:30] <ToddAndMargo> 30 not 390
