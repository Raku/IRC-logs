[10:18] <b_and_w> hi

[10:18] <b_and_w> i was wondering if anyone could tell me whether or not the following script runs correctly on their linux pc? (it's supposed to suck in a html and spit out a man page in roff/troff/whatever format)

[10:18] <b_and_w> i did not write it i dl-ed it from the web and im trying to use it but it does not create any file

[10:18] <b_and_w> note: i commented out line 67 cuz it kept causing an error message.

[10:18] <b_and_w> https://defuse.ca/b/Vo08xPUOuVy7WAAeKJc7JQ

[10:20] <b_and_w> ooops

[10:20] <b_and_w> here is the correct url:  https://defuse.ca/b/P9WcJ1VhNlypJlLDAwQMQl

[10:21] <Altai-man_> b_and_w, this is a former channel for Raku (former "Perl 6") language. if you are interested in Perl (5), I think #perl is a more appropriate channel to ask.

[10:22] <b_and_w> woah. i did not know there were signifigant differnces between perl versions. are there?

[10:23] <Altai-man_> raku is a separate, ve-e-e-ry different language, not a perl version, that had a bit confusing name before.

[10:24] <Altai-man_> you can visit https://raku.org/ and see if you're interested

[10:25] <b_and_w> so are you saying perl6 is the newer version of perl5, or does it just co-incidentally have a similar name or something?

[10:27] <b_and_w> oh its a FORK?

[10:27] <Altai-man_> b_and_w, historically perl 6 has started its development as an attempt to fix issues with perl, but then it diverged very much and turned out to be not "fixes", but a different language with its strong points and weak points, so perl and raku coexist and nothing replaces anything.

[10:27] <Altai-man_> no, it is not a fork

[10:27] <b_and_w> it's a total conversion

[10:28] <b_and_w> dunno if that gamer term applies to programming languages or not?

[10:30] <b_and_w> well im outtie

[10:30] *** b_and_w left
[10:30] <Altai-man_> good luck!
