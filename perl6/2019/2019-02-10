[00:23] <TreyHarris> I just wrote a lengthy response to "i"'s latest vague complaint about the docs being bad. It's long, but I hope I can refer to it in the future when such "I don't like it!" issues come in. https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/2617#issuecomment-462091390

[01:12] <leont> $?DISTRIBUTION is documented but if I try to use it I get a "Variable '$?DISTRIBUTION' is not declared. Did you mean 'Distribution'?"

[01:13] <timotimo> perhaps only when invoked from an installed module or something? though how would it compile it if that were the case ...

[01:56] <TreyHarris> leont: It looks like %?RESOURCES gives you much the same functionality--as far as letting a module figure out its own install location and look for files relative to it--so perhaps you can use that instead?

[02:42] <crella> Can someone kind to provide a archive of docs.perl6.org? I am from China, and the network connection isn't very good. I tried to use HTTrack, and it downloaded too many data than I thought the site should contain.

[02:43] <crella> By the way, I think tutorials on docs.perl6.org are too complicated so I often visit perl6maven later.

[02:44] <crella> Oh I have seen the github pages of the perl6 docs.

[02:45] <leont> Yeah

[02:47] <crella> To make perl6 scripts work as easy as Excel, it takes me a long time.

[02:48] <leont> It's more reference than tutorial

[02:50] <timotimo> https://docs.perl6.org/perl6.html - this is about 1 MB big and has everything the docs have

[02:50] <masak> crella: it's good to know some things on docs.perl6.org feel too complicated. if you want to point to particular examples, we might work on improving them.

[02:55] <crella> Can I put the module I wrote just in the same directory as the perl6 script and 'use' it on Windows?

[02:56] <crella> I am working to put the same code into a module.  I haven't done it when using perl5. I remembered tha perl5 @INC includes current directory.

[02:57] <timotimo> perl5's @INC had the current directory removed a year or so ago?

[02:57] *** Kaiepi joined
[02:57] <timotimo> perl6 might have never had it, i think?

[02:58] <timotimo> but you can "use lib '.'" or perl6 -I lib ...

[02:58] <crella> OK, just write it in **script start**  use './i-am-the-module.pm6';  ** script stop**

[03:07] <crella> How can I define a global variable in a module so I can 'say' it in another module? I tried 'our $a = 1' but not worked.

[03:11] <vrurg> crella: our $a is export = 1;

[03:12] <vrurg> Otherwise use qualified name: $Module::a

[03:14] <crella> $Module::a works.

[03:20] <crella> File a.pm6 */ module pcom {  sub pp { prompt 'hi';}} /* File e.pl */ use lib '.'; use a; pcom::pp(); /*

[03:20] <crella> How can I write the script so that 'p6 e.pl' shows an 'hi'?

[03:21] <crella> The 'prompt' function is very good that helps me do less.

[03:29] <crella> Ok, I see it on perl6maven and write ' sub pp is export {prompt 'hi';}'

[03:30] *** Cabanossi left
[03:30] <crella> What IDE or editors do you use?

[03:30] <crella> Vscode is a good choice but the animation is low on my laptop

[03:33] <vrurg> crella: I use atom for the reason that vim is extremely slow with perl6 syntax.

[10:09] *** leszekdubiel joined
[10:10] <leszekdubiel> I think it is hard to find per6 intro from main web page... 

[10:10] <leszekdubiel> I click Documentation, then the first option is "Language Ref & Tutorials", I go there... and it's nothing for begginers. 

[10:12] <timotimo> hm, how to make it clearer that Resources is where the good stuff is?

[10:12] <leszekdubiel> I have had to google... and I found perl6intro.com. But that link is hidden in "comprehensive list of Perl 6 resources"... 

[10:12] <leszekdubiel> I suggest to move perl6intro.com linkt to the top of section under Documentation on this page: https://docs.perl6.org/

[10:12] <timotimo> the "brief introduction" also links to "a number of useful resources" for that very page

[10:13] <leszekdubiel> Ok... I am a novice to perl6... go to Documentation, then Tutorials, then Brief Introduction... and what I see...

[10:14] <leszekdubiel> annotated programming example -- excellent! 

[10:14] <leszekdubiel> what next? containers? I'm not interested now... Roles? I don't need them... later... 

[10:14] <leszekdubiel> so where to go next? well... i have to google  more documentation... 

[10:15] <timotimo> the "number of useful resources" link could be moved further up on the Brief Introduction page and given a bit more text?

[10:15] <cpan-p6> New module released to CPAN! IoC (0.0.4) by 03UFOBAT

[10:15] <leszekdubiel> and after a few days I have found  perl6intro.com and that cute page https://github.com/perlpilot/perl6-docs/blob/master/intro/p6-regex-intro.pod  -- regex itroduction 

[10:18] <leszekdubiel> this is not criticism, but I suggest to put some visible links for novices ...   otherwise novices get into advanced Reference

[10:18] <timotimo> i think it's valuable input!

[10:19] *** crella6 left
[10:19] <leszekdubiel> another example --  google     "perl6 split" ...   and "perl split" 

[10:20] <leszekdubiel> on google "perl split"  i go directly to page:     https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split.html     and I read for 2 minutes and I know how to use

[10:20] <leszekdubiel> after googling   "perl6 split"   i go to page    https://docs.perl6.org/routine/split   ... and this is okey 

[10:22] <leszekdubiel> but what I seeeee?     class Cool? I don't know what cool is....     when I read lines from file I use Cool or not? I don't know...   I scroll below and see examples -- they are good. 

[10:22] <leszekdubiel> But I have to read until middle of the page to find that "Str" has function split ... now I am happy because I'm processing string 

[10:23] <leszekdubiel> Maybe Class Str should appear at the top .... 

[10:23] *** Aceeri__ joined
[10:24] <leszekdubiel> Or maybe there should be some simple examples at the top of the page on split function? I think no novice would understand: multi sub    split(  Str:D $delimiter, Str(Cool) $input, $limit = Inf, :$k, :$v, :$kv, :$p, :$skip-empty)  

[10:25] <leszekdubiel> and novices look how to split string ... 

[10:25] *** mns` joined
[10:25] <leszekdubiel> thank you for reading ... :) :) 

[10:25] <timotimo> it is crucially important for documentation readers to understand signatures - which is why it's part of the brief introduction page

[10:26] <timotimo> i consider this a weakness of the docs that i don't know how to fix

[10:26] <timotimo> but the thought that a beginner would skip the part from class Cool is a new one

[10:30] <timotimo> oh, interesting

[10:31] <timotimo> you know we can totally put a link from every "bunch of signatures" box to the signatures doc

[10:31] <timotimo> or, even better, have an automated thingie that can expand signatures to a human-readable description

[11:22] <ufobat___> what is thet difference between put and say?

[11:22] <jmerelo> ufobat___: say uses gist, put uses .Str

[11:22] <ufobat___> AH!

[11:23] <ufobat___> documentation sais "machine readable format" which was quite confusing to me

[11:23] <jmerelo> m: class Foo { method gist { "Gist" }; method Str {"Str"}}; my $foo = Foo.new; $foo.say; $foo.put

[11:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar d904b7048: OUTPUT: «Gist␤Str␤»

[11:23] <jmerelo> ufobat___: gist should be a machine readable format, right. By convention. Maybe create an issue?

[11:23] <ufobat___> okay

[11:26] *** woolfy left

[11:27] <ufobat___> jmerelo, wouldn't be .perl better for a "maschine readable" format

[11:27] <timotimo> yeah

[11:28] <jmerelo> ufobat___: ah, right.

[11:28] <ufobat___> anyway the point is, its not in the docs

[11:28] <jmerelo> ufobat___: so it's not that it's not clear, it's that it's wrong.

[11:28] <jmerelo> ufobat___: I'm sure it's somewhere there... But issue it anyway and I'll try to clarify.

[11:42] <masak> actually, I meant to ask about that on the channel the other day -- given that both Perl 5 and Perl 6 (a) thought it a good idea to have '.' in the lib path, and (b) got rid of it for security reasons... what exactly *is* the attack vector being pictured here?

[11:55] <El_Che> masak: code run from shared or writable filesystems like /tmp or /var/tmp?

[11:57] <masak> El_Che: ah, so you mean someone carefully seeds a /tmp directory with modules that are known to be used in some script, and then gains control?

[11:58] <El_Che> yes

[11:58] <masak> is that still an issue if the '.' comes last in the list?

[11:59] <El_Che> maybe with required?

[11:59] <El_Che> still, far fetched

[12:00] <El_Che> next to /tmp, maybe thinking of things like /var/www /cgi and the like

[12:01] <El_Che> I am pretty sure the p5 dicussion must have been documented somewheren

[12:01] <El_Che> And Perl 5 being rather consevative I would be surprised if they didn't have a good reason. Maybe leont knows more.

[12:03] <El_Che> (addition: it's not uncommon for scripts that run as "nobody" to be started from common sticky-bitted directories)

[12:05] <pmurias> masak: in Perl 6 the modules from . where taken *first*

[12:06] <pmurias> due to a bug

[12:07] <pmurias> masak: in Perl 5 some modules have optional dependencies

[12:07] <masak> oh. oh! :/

[12:07] <El_Che> pmurias: we don't have something similar with require?

[12:08] <pmurias> El_Che: yes, we have loading of stuff at runtime too

[12:10] <pmurias> masak: so running an Perl 5 script with an optional unmet dependency in say an unpacked .tar.gz directory you downloaded from somewhere could still run evil code

[12:11] <masak> right

[12:12] <masak> something like "holes" in the set of available modules

[12:29] <masak> what's the name of the ?? !! operator?

[12:30] <jmerelo> masak: ternary operator, I think.

[12:31] <jmerelo> masak: but it's probably defined as two different operators. There's no such thing as a hyper-circumfix-pre-post-fix operator

[12:31] <masak> jmerelo: thanks, but not what I was fishing for :)

[12:32] <masak> jmerelo: (in Rakudo's Grammar.nqp, it *is* an infix, called infix:sym<?? !!>)

[12:33] <masak> (it's just a very weirdly parsed infix, with variable content between its starter ?? and its stopper !!) :P

[12:33] <jmerelo> masak: Ah, OK. Well, what do I know... And also behind and after. It's a post-in-prefix

[12:34] <masak> no, not really. it's an infix. in `A ?? B !! C`, it occurs in-between A and C.

[12:35] <masak> anyway, the answer to my question seems to be "there is no such sub exposed"

[12:35] <masak> if it were exposed, what *would* it be called? :)

[12:36] <jmerelo> masak: again, ternary, I guess: https://docs.perl6.org/language/operators#index-entry-operator_ternary

[12:36] <masak> jmerelo: &infix:<ternary> ?

[13:22] <masak> tyil: it's similar to jmerelo++'s suggestion above.

[13:23] <masak> tyil: thing is, the sub is usually called something with the symbols themselves. but `infix:<?? !!>` is an illegal name, since infixes can't have that space there. only circumfixes and postcircumfixes get to have a space.

[13:23] <tyil> hmm

[13:24] <tyil> would it somehow work having a ?? and a !! function?

[13:29] <masak> no, they are definitely one thing, not two

[13:30] <masak> it's definitely one of the weirdest operators, ever. but it's also quite, what's the word, entrenched.

[13:31] <masak> even though it's practically the same, I don't think Perl 6 users (or people in general) would be as happy with a macro `cond(a, b, c)`

[16:54] <ufobat_> i've got a couple of multi subs with the same name. is there a way to execute a hook before one of those gets executed (for logging purposes)

[16:55] <jmerelo> ufobat_: you can use the proto and whateverCode

[16:56] <ufobat_> but for proto i need to have common parameters?

[16:57] <jmerelo> ufobat_: or use |

[16:57] <jmerelo> for proto you just need the common name in principle.

[16:57] <leont> Exactly

[16:58] <ufobat_> m: proto a($a) { say "data: ", $a.perl; * }; multi sub a(Int $a) { say "Int" }; multi sub a(Str $a) {say "Str" }; a(1)

[16:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar d904b7048: OUTPUT: «data: 1␤»

[16:58] <ufobat_> could you fix that for me?

[16:58] <timotimo> i think it has to be {*}

[16:58] <timotimo> m: proto a($a) { say "data: ", $a.perl; {*} }; multi sub a(Int $a) { say "Int" }; multi sub a(Str $a) {say "Str" }; a(1)

[16:59] <leont> Yeah

[16:59] <ufobat_> thanks!

[17:00] <ufobat_> why does this work: proto a($a) {*}

[17:00] <leont> It's only a star when that's the whole content of the sub, conceptually all multi's have a proto a(|) { * }

[17:00] *** saki left
[17:00] <leont> Because huffmanization, I'd assume

[17:00] <ufobat_> i see

[17:00] <ufobat_> okay thanks!

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: a bunch of issues are being closed right now

[17:45] <tony-o> are the guys talking abOUYT THE http::server crap on github in here?

[17:45] <AlexDaniel> xD

[17:47] <tony-o> ::threaded was a temp fix for a problem in moar that was fixed a couple of years ago and shouldn't be used

[17:47] <tony-o> http::server was released and it was moved to where it was as part of a consolidation effort with ::async and re:never released, i likely forgot to update the META with it

[17:48] <tony-o> there was also a lot of argument over the name because it was the first double booking of a name but with different auths we had in the ecosystem

[17:48] <jmerelo> tony-o: at least me...

[17:48] <tony-o> so, could also be someone else changed it to fix that problem

[17:48] <tony-o> "problem"

[17:48] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: great

[17:49] *** ravenousmoose left
[17:49] <tony-o> ::async isn't something i have stayed up to date with since i moved it but can take a look at compilation issues if we have them

[17:49] <jmerelo> tony-o: the main problem is it's using a "register" method which I was unable to find anywhere else.

[17:49] <jmerelo> tony-o: the problems are described in the issue

[17:50] <jmerelo> tony-o: but a new problem is that http::server using http::server as a name is creating a whole lot of problems by itself.

[17:50] <tony-o> which issue are you referring to?

[17:50] <jmerelo> tony-o: let me see

[17:51] <jmerelo> tony-o: https://github.com/perl6/perl6-http-server-async/issues/33

[17:51] <jmerelo> tony-o: wait, not that one

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> uhhh this one https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem-unbitrot/issues/571

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> “chars requires a concrete string, but got null”

[17:51] *** tyil joined
[17:52] <jmerelo> tony-o: so eventually I didn't raise an issue, but https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-http-server-async-plugins-router-simple/blob/master/lib/HTTP/Server/Async/Plugins/Router/Simple.pm6 fails because "register" does not exist.

[17:54] <tony-o> ahh, i believe that's because the method changed to `middleware`

[17:56] <tony-o> obviously cannot find HTTP::Server::Async :p

[17:57] <jmerelo> tony-o: so, can you help fixing the issues there? And, while you're at that, can you contribute to change of name? https://github.com/perl6-community-modules/perl6-http-server/issues

[17:58] <tony-o> can you put the h-s-a stuff back into the ecosystem?

[17:58] <tony-o> also, yes

[17:58] <jmerelo> tony-o: was it taken off? Was it me?

[17:58] <tony-o> why are we changing the name of HTTP::Server ?

[17:58] <AlexDaniel> .oO( Deprecated::HTTP::Server ? )

[17:59] <jmerelo> tony-o: several reason. First, there are other http::responses out there. Second, http::server contains http::server _and_ http::response _and_ http::request. Third, it's a role, so it might be better to call it http::server::role

[18:00] <jmerelo> tony-o: and the whole thing changed to HTTP::Roles or Roles::HTTP Hum, maybe not. I don't know.

[19:58] <avuserow> this happened in my module code, which I name as .pm6, and I'm willing to concede on that being a problem

[19:59] <AlexDaniel> mmm

[19:59] <avuserow> the most interesting one for me is for entrypoints, which I usually leave extension-less since they end up in my /usr/bin or equivalent

[20:07] <leont> Ah, right. That helps

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> sooo, I don't know, should we patch `prove` now?

[21:06] <leszekdubiel> how to take one  letter from beginning of string and four letters from the end? 

[21:06] <leszekdubiel> in perl5:                 perl -e 'my $a = "asdfghjkl"; print $a =~ s/\A(.).*(....)\z/$1...$2/r; print "\n"; '

[21:06] <leszekdubiel> prints    a...hjkl

[21:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar d904b7048: OUTPUT: «a...hjkl␤»

[21:07] <tbrowder> In English, all month and weekday names are always capitalized.  Most of the other languages of the five I entered always use lower-case unless starting a sentence or such. German seemed to be an exception. I would like to be consistent as is possible for each language, so I rely on the native or expert language person to choose what each defaults should be. That is the purpos of the table: show what is in each language hash.

[21:07] <leszekdubiel> ok, thanks

[21:09] <sena_kun> tbrowder, roger, thanks for the explanation! _writes a commit_

[21:52] <tbrowder> ok, ref date abbreviations for some languages: i will make new category hashes called %mowa and %dowa which will contain a mixed set of the shortest abbreviation when a language doesn't have a complete set of 2- or 3-letter abbrevs. comments? does that make sense?

[22:12] <sena_kun> for this specific case, there is probably a trick...

[22:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar d904b7048: OUTPUT: «｢5｣␤｢5｣␤ 0 => ｢5｣␤»

[22:13] <sena_kun> Elronnd, you want += the other way around.

[22:13] <sena_kun> m: my $bar = 9; given 4 { when 0 .. 9 { $_ += $bar; say $_; } }

[22:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar d904b7048: OUTPUT: «Cannot assign to an immutable value␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:13] <sena_kun> oops

[22:14] <sena_kun> well, the semantics is correct, anyway, as it is $bar that changes, not $_.

[22:15] <Elronnd> I thought $_ referred to the most recent evaluated expression, so it should be 13 in that case

[22:15] <sena_kun> it's not, I think.

[22:16] <timotimo> there are "contextualizers" that will set $_

[23:03] <Elronnd> I made a partial application thingy http://sprunge.us/GXstgj.  I want to add named parameters to it, but I'm not sure how; if I had a **%params, I get an error

[23:04] <timotimo> you need *%params

[23:05] <Elronnd> ah

[23:05] <Elronnd> why?

[23:06] <timotimo> that's how named arguments get slurped

[23:06] <Elronnd> but, why's it inconsistent

[23:06] <timotimo> named parameters don't have a structure that you could have to preserve

[23:06] <timotimo> so no need for ** or +

[23:06] <timotimo> there's just * there

[23:07] <Elronnd> ahh

[23:07] *** mowcat joined
[23:08] <Elronnd> is there a way to make the 'ret' function anonymous?

[23:08] <timotimo> sure

[23:08] <timotimo> just leave "ret" out and also "&ret" at the end

[23:09] <Elronnd> ...duh

[23:09] <Elronnd> of course

[23:09] <Elronnd> :P

[23:10] <timotimo> :)

[23:15] <Elronnd> is it possible to declare multiple variables on the same line?  Like my $a, $b;?

[23:17] *** lichtkind left
[23:18] <sena_kun> my ($a, $b);

[23:19] <Elronnd> thanks
