[05:44] <Elronnd> how can I turn an int into an enum?

[05:45] <Elronnd> like, if I have enum X<a b c>, and I have a 1, how can I turn that into an X::b?

[05:45] <Elronnd> tried my X $f = 1 but that errors

[05:57] <elcaro> ufobat_: I just tried and got the same error. I'd guess some change deeper in the guts (ie. MoarVM) might have broke it... but niner would know best.

[07:29] <rba[m]> moritz: any news from the broken server?

[07:33] <moritz> rba[m]: it's broken, and is very likely to remain that way

[07:33] <abraxxa> what needs to be done?

[07:33] <moritz> tyil: I have access to many of the hooks

[07:33] <tyil> neat

[07:34] <tyil> I'm running Geth on my infra now, could you update one hook to use "https://geth.svc.tyil.net" as URL?

[07:34] <tyil> you should be able to leave off the :8888 thing, as I'm hosting it :443 which is the default for https

[07:36] <moritz> tyil: ok, I've updated the URL for perl6/doc

[07:36] <tyil> iirc there should be a button to re-try an old payload for testing purposes

[07:37] <moritz> I remember seeing that in the past, but right now I don#t

[07:37] <tyil> hmmm

[07:37] <tyil> let me think of another way to test this then

[07:38] <moritz> I'll just push an empty commit

[07:38] <timotimo> what was the old URL?

[07:38] <moritz> hack.p6c.org:8888

[07:38] <tyil> hack.p6c.org I believe

[07:38] <timotimo> perhaps we should in the future have one DNS entry for every bot so we can do fine-grained control whenever we move stuff around

[07:38] <Geth> ¦ doc: 82008e19dd | (Moritz Lenz)++ | 0 files

[07:38] <Geth> ¦ doc: Empty, please ignore

[07:38] <Geth> ¦ doc: 

[07:38] <Geth> ¦ doc: just to test the new commit hook

[07:38] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/82008e19dd

[07:38] <timotimo> well, hack is down at the moment, so in theory we could have that point at geth.svc.tyil.net for the time being

[07:39] <tyil> I would very much recommend doing some CNAME games

[07:39] <moritz> I can do that, but then you'd have to open port 8888 as well

[07:39] <timotimo> true, but that should be easy as well

[07:39] <tyil> I am aware hack is down, I'm hosting geth because I saw people asking for geth :p

[07:39] <timotimo> netcat/socat to the rescue

[07:39] <tyil> moritz: I can expose :8888 with no worries

[07:39] <timotimo> i know that :)

[07:39] <timotimo> what i meant was "nobody needs the domain to point at something in particular at the moment"

[07:40] <tyil> ah

[07:40] <tyil> at least it seems to work

[07:40] <tyil> which is a good thing

[07:41] <moritz> timotimo: that sounds good, as soon as we have well-established control over perl6 related DNS

[07:41] <moritz> (re one domain per bot)

[07:42] <moritz> mlenz@shell01vp:~ > dig hack.p6c.org +short

[07:42] <moritz> geth.svc.tyil.ne.

[07:42] <moritz> aaarrgh

[07:42] <moritz> forgot the t

[07:42] <tyil> moritz: :8888 should be available now

[07:42] <tyil> (:443 is also still available)

[07:43] <rba> Would like to get https://rakudo.org/files/ back to live. Need some hints though...

[07:43] <moritz> ok, fix is in, should percolate through the various DNS caches in about a day or so

[07:43] <tyil> I don't think it does TLS on :8888, only on :443

[07:43] <moritz> aye, it's http://hack.p6c.org:8888/

[07:44] <tyil> also, if anyone has kubernetes experience and would like access to the part of my infra hosting Perl 6 services, let me know

[07:44] <tyil> it may be useful to have someone around able to inspect issues when I'm asleep :p

[07:44] <timotimo> rba: unless you can conjure the files out of thin air, i don't know how

[07:45] <rba> uch. so the build files are gone?

[07:45] <timotimo> moritz: you have control over p6c.org?

[07:45] <timotimo> i don't know if the .msi and .dmg files are anywhere else than www.p6c.org

[07:47] <moritz> timotimo: I have control over the domain

[07:47] <moritz> I haven't recovered the hard drives yet

[07:47] <rba> timotimo: may we rebuild them?

[07:47] <timotimo> moritz: did you write about what you've tried with the server so far? i recall multiple resets and connecting a serial console, but no luck getting it to boot

[07:47] <tyil> does anyone know how Geth used to do authentication?

[07:48] <moritz> timotimo: neither did removing of single ram thingies help

[07:48] <timotimo> OK

[07:48] <moritz> didn't have many tools in the DC to try more stuff

[07:48] <timotimo> dang, you'd expect a DC to have lots of stuff for that kind of problem :|

[07:48] <timotimo> is taking out the hard drive the next step?

[07:48] <timotimo> unless that somehow got damaged, we'll easily get the rakudo.org/files from there

[07:49] <Woodi> hi today

The things I accumulate are value types and eqv works, but only when I take a reference my $old = $H at the beginning of the loop. Otherwise ENTER $H<> is apparently empty. Alas, I can't reproduce it yet. Does anyone know offhand if what I'm doing is safe at all?

[11:27] <rba> Are the rakude releases in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/releases actually rakudo-star releases? 

[11:29] <MasterDuke> rba: no, those are just compiler releases

[11:30] <rba> So the star-releas is here https://github.com/rakudo/star/releases ?

[11:31] <timotimo> probably not working, tbh

[11:34] <rba> timotimo: why?

[11:39] <timotimo> what i know: whenever people download the releases of moarvm from github, they can't install it, because the submodules don't get put into the archives

[11:39] *** raynold_ left
[11:39] <timotimo> perhaps rakudo doesn't have any submodules though?

[11:40] <timotimo> anyway, i've tried multiple times in the past to make the releases tab either disappear or show a warning to people

[11:40] <timotimo> but every single time someone pushes a tag, any tag, github just re-generates all releases that i had deleted

[11:41] <rba> timotimo: no, you're right. Will try to get star from the build tag and then try to build.

[14:57] <hasuwiz> Good evening #Perl6

[14:57] <tyil> hi hasuwiz 

[15:08] <raschipi> Have you guys seen this: https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/b718ab29. Debian now detects when a package is shipping precompiled Perl6, which it shouldn't do.

[15:09] *** khisanth_ joined
[15:12] *** robertle left
[15:14] <moritz> in the case of python, they do precompilation in a postinst scrip, I believe

[15:15] <raschipi> In Debian they that also, don't they? Ask for Perl6 to precompile and cache modules at install time.

[15:15] <raschipi> Or is that just when Rakudo/Moar is upgraded?

[15:16] <nine> raschipi: why don't they ship precompiled Perl 6 modules? Doesn't make sense to have all users waste cycles on something that can be done once on a build farm.

[15:17] *** molaf joined
[15:20] <guifa> .tell jnthn sadly I ended up having to go with the custom associative class (re GH question).  I managed to find a way to do the backtracking to work well enough to warn my users though the calling file check isn’t the prettiest (one liner, but still).  But it’s actually given me some cool other ideas for instantiating some other class objects along the way so it’s not for naught

[15:20] <yoleaux> guifa: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[15:20] <raschipi> I think it's this bug: https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126894

[15:23] <nine> I'm quite sure all the issues in that ticket have been resolved.

[15:24] <raschipi> Hum, dunno then.

[15:25] <nine> nqp's Configure.pl has a working --with-moar option and rakudo's Configure.pl has a working --with-nqp option. There's the Staging repository and tools/install-dist.p6 for packaging modules.

[15:25] <nine> FWIW openSUSE has shipped precompiled Perl 6 module packages for years.

[15:26] <raschipi> domidumont: Are you aware what's the situation here?

[15:28] <skids> from the tag name for the issue, I would guess that the precomp files generated during two separate builds are not identical.

[15:28] <nine> skids: are presumed to not be identical (inferring that from the "pretty sure")

[15:29] <nine> That hasn't been the case in... about 2 years I think

[15:29] *** mowcat joined
[15:29] <raschipi> Yes, it's in the context of the reproducible builds effort.

[15:30] <skids> Maybe find and ask this "Chris Lamb"?

[15:30] <raschipi> But the .pyc mention makes it clear it's about not shipping prebuilt modules.

[15:30] <nine> If precomp files are not reproducible that's a bug that needs to be reported.

[15:30] <raschipi> u/lamby on reddit

[15:31] * nine is trying to create an account on their gitlab to comment on the commit

[15:31] <raschipi> You can log in using github, I think.

[16:35] <rba> I‘ve learnd a lot this afternoon how to put the rakudo build together. Yet I still had some issues as I did it for a customer with internet access only via http proxy. So had to do some changes.

[16:37] *** hankache left
[16:37] *** hankache joined
[16:37] <rba> We need the rakudo-star 2019.03 soon again for download. So I hope moritz is able to recover it or it needs a rebuild.

[16:39] <rba> How to build rakudo-star is documented in detail, yet I haven‘t found the same for rakudo and nqp. MoarVM is luckily still availalable for download.

[16:42] <raschipi> Shouldn't the infra outage be noted at the top of perl6.org?

[16:42] <hankache> hi

[16:43] <hankache> do you want me to rebuild star?

[16:45] *** zacts joined

[17:26] <tyil> looking at https://rakudo.org/files/star/source, I think the build instructions for Linux/MacOS are a bit off

[17:27] *** sauvin left
[17:28] <tyil> AlexDaniel: it was reported that the official link to download rakudo-star at isn't available (https://rakudo.org/latest/star/source returns 500 for me as well), so if we have new builds we can upload them to various other servers to keep the available

[17:29] <hankache> Here you go: https://perl6intro.com/files/index.html

[17:30] <tyil> hankache: sweet, thanks!

[17:30] <hankache> I actually still have copies of the original ones. Too bad I can't figure out where the msi is. I guess I'll have to rebuild

[17:31] <tyil> this tarball is much smaller than what I had :p

[17:31] <tyil> https://pkg.tyil.nl/perl6/rakudo-star/

[17:32] <tyil> if there's more packages available, please highlight me and I'll make them available on my servers as well

[17:33] <hankache> AlexDaniel: All copies where hosted on rakudo.org/files. Since it is down we do not have a "canonical" source. 

[17:35] <hankache> tyil: will try to rebuild MSI now

[17:35] <hankache> .seen clarkema

[17:35] <yoleaux> I saw clarkema 16 Mar 2019 19:47Z in #perl6: <clarkema> I was hoping to get around to it today, but had to put out some work fires

[17:35] <tyil> hankache: I very much appreciate you taking the time to build these :)

[17:37] <hankache> .tell clarkema do you by any chance still have a copy of the dmg for R*? File server went down and we need to host the files somewhere else.

[17:37] <yoleaux> hankache: I'll pass your message to clarkema.

[17:37] *** woolfy left
[17:37] <hankache> tyil: no problem. unfortunately I won't be able to take care of the dmg. I hope clarkema replies soon

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> hankache: that includes rakudo, nqp and moar releases?

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> hankache: anyway, can't you just upload the same files?

[17:43] <AlexDaniel> undersightable6 has some copies, but maybe not of star… I'm not sure

[17:43] <hankache> AlexDaniel: I have no idea what went down. I just noticed that R* is no longer available and thought of providing the latest one again since I was the one who released it.

[17:44] <AlexDaniel> yeah but is it a new file or just the same one reuploaded?

[17:44] <hankache> AlexDaniel: the tar.gz is the same but I no longer have the MSI so will have to rebuild

[17:45] <hankache> AlexDaniel: I reuploaded here https://perl6intro.com/files/index.html

[17:54] <hankache> I just made this temporary change to perl6.org https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/commit/71c79446b9252b5c06fa870bd8db7c41649c96bb

[17:55] <hankache> This is supposed to be a temporary fix. Whenever the server issues get fixed please revert it ASAP. Thanks.

[20:23] <mojca> I installed the latest version of MoarVM, nqp, rakudo (2019.03[.1])

[20:24] <mojca> all the tests pass

[20:24] <timotimo> perhaps you have some old precompiled files around on your drive

[20:26] <mojca> timotimo: where should I look?

[20:26] <mojca> also, I had the old version installed when compiling the new one

[20:26] <timotimo> look for .moarvm files under /opt/local/

[20:26] <mojca> but i'm not actually using rakudo, so …

[20:26] <timotimo> that should be overwritten or not be accessed any more :\

[20:27] <mojca> old installation gets removed in any case

[20:30] <mojca> I don't yet see anything suspicious: https://paste.macports.org/a08418dd2bc3

[22:02] <comborico1611> What is the difference between a scripting programming language and a shell?  Could p6 replace a shell?

[22:02] <mithaldu_> El_Che: hi

[22:03] *** Aceeri left
[22:04] <sena_kun> what is the equivalent of `method foo { do_stuff; super.foo }`, `nextsame`? It works, but I wonder if that's the right way.

[22:07] <sena_kun> comborico1611, a shell is just a program that takes your input, runs programs and shows you results. when people write "programs" in e.g. bash it is more of an imitation, because it has some interpreter abilities and statements like `while` or `if` are in fact programs, not statements of the shell itself. at the same time, a scripting language is a, well, generic-purpose programming language you can use to write scripts, so a different 

[22:07] <sena_kun> beast.

[22:08] <sena_kun> comborico1611, it is not clear to me what do you mean by "replace" in this context.

[22:09] <comborico1611> sena_kun: I see.  a shell is a program, not a language

[22:09] <timotimo> a shell is typically a program that has a specific language that it accepts, though

[22:09] *** |Sno| joined
[22:09] <timotimo> you usually refer to the language and teh program with the same name

[22:10] <comborico1611> is a shell basically like a programming language interpeter?

[22:10] <sena_kun> comborico1611, well, technically it has a "language" and people are like implementing Chess or some weird tricks in it, but that's hmm.

[22:10] <timotimo> you could say that, though it's pretty important to shells that it executes everything as soon as you've finished typing "one thing"

[22:10] <comborico1611> Hmm. thank you.

[22:11] <timotimo> which isn't always the case for programming language interpreters

[22:11] <timotimo> but a "repl" gets you relatively close

[22:12] *** [Sno] left
[22:13] <comborico1611> so there are two kinds of interpreters, interpreters and REPL?

[22:13] <timotimo> the distinction is really very fuzzy

[22:14] <comborico1611> I see.

[22:14] <timotimo> there's compilers with repls, too

[22:14] <timotimo> i'd maybe call a repl a "mode of operation/usage"

[22:14] <comborico1611> What language uses compiler with REPL?

[22:15] *** mtj_ left
[22:15] <sena_kun> timotimo, any ideas about `method foo { super.foo }`?

[22:15] <timotimo> i'd claim haskell fits that description

[22:15] <sena_kun> comborico1611, Haskell

[22:15] <timotimo> sena_kun: well, i know you can self.SuperClassName::foo, but that's probably not what you mean, right?

[22:15] <sena_kun> no, it is likely the thing I want. :)

[22:15] <sena_kun> thanks

[22:15] <sena_kun> I've tried SuperClassName.foo, but it just called it on type object. :|
