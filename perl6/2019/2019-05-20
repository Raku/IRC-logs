[06:29] <holyghost> jmerelo : I'm writing docs for Bayes::Learn, where should the pod document go and what would be its file extention ?

[06:30] <moritz> lib/Bayes/Learn.pod6

[06:30] <moritz> I think

[06:30] <holyghost> thanks 

[06:30] *** ravenousmoose joined
[06:30] <jmerelo> holyghost: pod can go in the same file as the rest. If you use skaji's mi6, a stub will be automatically generated.

[06:31] <holyghost> jmerelo : what do you mean by "in the same file as the rest" ?

[06:32] <jmerelo> holyghost: as the rest of the code. Bayes.pm6 includes code _and_ pod

[06:32] <holyghost> ok, there is no Bayes.pm6, so I just use it write the docs then

[06:32] <jmerelo> There should be. I've told you that several times before.

[06:33] *** netrino joined
[06:33] <holyghost> I know

[06:33] <jmerelo> But also a Bayes/Learn.pm6 _with_ pod included.

[06:33] <holyghost> ok, so a lib/Bayes/Learn/Bayes.pm6 and a lib/Bayes/Learn.pm6 ?

[06:34] <jmerelo> if you have a Bayes::Learn::Bayes module, yes. If not, lib/Bayes.pm6 should include the documentation for the Bayes module (if you decide to call it that way)

[06:36] <jmerelo> In your case, I would say a Bayes/Learn.pm6 is what's needed, since that seems to be the main module.

[06:36] <holyghost> so lib/Bayes/Learn.pm6 .. ?

[06:36] <holyghost> I want to include all docs in one file of course

[06:37] <jmerelo> But I would say it's much more important that you write tests for that. There is only one, and it compares something with itself.

[06:37] <jmerelo> That test only tests one of the 5 or 6 modules you publish

[06:37] <holyghost> ok

[06:37] <jmerelo> The README.md is not in markdown

[06:38] <holyghost> ?

[06:38] <jmerelo> And there are several other minor problems, like assigning a value to an attribute in build instead of doing it by default.

[06:39] <jmerelo> holyghost: it's just plain text

[06:39] <jmerelo> Bayes::Learn::Action will simply not compile.

[06:39] <jmerelo> So, if you really want to do this.

[06:40] <jmerelo> 1. Create a use_ok test for every one of the files in the distribution.

[06:40] <jmerelo> 2. Create unitary tests for every one of the functions in every one of the files.

[06:41] <jmerelo> 3. Write documentation for the base class (Bayes::Learn) and every one of the functions in every one of the files.

[06:41] <jmerelo> And, most important.

[06:41] <jmerelo> 4. Don't publish a new version until you've done 1 to 3

[06:41] <holyghost> should the README.md be git HTML ?

[06:42] <jmerelo> holyghost: md is for markdown. It's conventionally in markdown. It's fine if you want to do txt, but then call it README.txt or simply README.

[06:43] <jmerelo> Also 5. Use a source control system such as git (over GitHub or GitLab) to host your source and, well, control it.

[06:43] <holyghost> ok

[06:44] <holyghost> It'll take some time

[20:38] <jnthn> .tell Kaipei I've got DBIish::SQLite running in a multi-threaded program fine, fwiw; one musn't share an individual connection (which is a normal restriction on database drivers anyway). Also the underlying library should be threadsafe (there's a method to check that; see the README).

[20:38] <yoleaux> jnthn: I'll pass your message to Kaipei.

[20:39] <jnthn> .tell Kaipei That said, the DB::* modules are better built than DBIish, so... :)

[23:03] <Kaiepi> sena_kun, DB::SQLite's working great!

[23:03] <Kaiepi> good work

[23:04] <sena_kun> well, not like I created it... But glad if Perl 6 is useful. :)

[23:07] <Kaiepi> oh lol
