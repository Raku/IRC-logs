[00:20] <irced> i must be addicted to perl6 because my heart pumped extra when i discovered ctags supports perl6 as a language, which means i can jump to my function declaration in pm6 files from my pl6 files and back in vim with the power of my mind! err, keyboard anyway

[00:21] <discord6> <Rogue> I get a little giddy every time a new p6weekly comes out lol

[00:21] <discord6> <Rogue> so you're not alone

[11:35] <Xliff_> Is there a way to perform a match operation, and then use that Match object to perform a subst on the original string?

[11:35] <Xliff_> Kinda like: 

[11:35] <Xliff_> m: regex a { 'a'+ }; $a = 'aabaabaaaa'; say $a ~~ &a;

[11:35] <evalable6> Xliff_, rakudo-moar fce964231: OUTPUT: «(exit code 1) 04===SORRY!04===␤Variable '$a' is not declared␤at /tmp/YBeoDEC…»

[11:36] <Xliff_> And then replace that 'aa' somehow and have that reflected back in $a?

[11:37] <Xliff_> It seems strange that I have tha Match object, and to subst, I'd have to use s///;

[22:22] <tellable6> irced, I'll pass your message to camelia

[22:25] * irced wonders about Camelia.

[22:32] <irced> so i'm wondering how my code could be so much cooler using substitution as in $toformat ~~ s/ <wb>a<wb> /{colored("a", %colortable<a>)}/; where obviously toformat and colortable have been defined. i want to generalize so that the letter that matched, a, can be substituted into the substitution expression e.g. something $toformat ~~ s/ <wb>a<wb> /{colored("$0", %colortable{~$0})}/; i'm not sure about the map 

[22:32] <irced> lookup but anyway i can't get $0 to even go into the first part...

[22:32] <irced> any thoughts?

[22:35] <irced> obviously we can't test Terminal::ANSIColor here (or even on f.perl.bot) but maybe someone has done something similar?

[22:36] <irced> maybe i need to be explicit about $/[0]

[22:40] <Xliff> Is there a JSON object out there that can parse without the need for quoted keys?

[22:40] <irced> p6: my $targetstr = "what is a octarine color"; $targetstr ~~ s/ <wb>a<wb> /{say "an"}/; #testing

[23:35] <irced> and you can take that to the bank

[23:35] <irced> but they might call security on you, the ones with the white coats

[23:36] <irced> unless you say that a is also divisible by some number which may or may not leave a remainder

[23:36] <irced> then they'll just ignore you

[23:38] <irced> and might add, "pretty colors", especially if there is a customer wearing tai-die

[23:38] * irced goes back to being relevant.

[23:39] *** wamba left
[23:43] <irced> .tell Elronnd glad i was able to help, i know what you're thinking tho, what the heap!

[23:43] <tellable6> irced, I'll pass your message to Elronnd

[23:54] <Geth> ¦ problem-solving: vrurg assigned to jnthn Issue A threat of full CORE duplication for each language revision https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/issues/104

[23:56] <vrurg> irced is flapping. Would he be a test we'd need to fit him!

[23:56] <vrurg> *fix him

[23:56] * irced checks his circuits guardedly.

[23:57] * irced steps thru his lifecycle.

[23:58] *** leont left
[23:58] * irced appears to be having tremendous difficulty.

[23:59] * irced concurs with vrurg.
