[04:46] <Cirno> Sorry for my bad english. In Lisp, many diverse language constructs are reached through macros at the language level. I would like to know if it was done the same in perl6.

[04:49] <Itaipu> Cirno: I think macro are more for compiled languages, not interpreted ones, where the runtime does more magic :)

[04:55] <Cirno> thx

[04:55] <Cirno> One more question. Is it possible to overload standard operators and create your own syntax based on macros?

[05:18] <holyghost> I've made some List classes in psp-gcc (the objective-c part), they're on Xliff's server in a moment

[05:19] <holyghost> There's no gnustep, Foundation or libobjc's AFAIK in gcc objective-c

[05:20] <holyghost> IIRC there's libobjc2

[05:26] <holyghost> It's always nice to have some custom list classes for lisp/scheme hackers

When I last looked into Perl 6, Rakudo didn't yet completely implement the "Christmas" spec; but now, the Perl 6 and Rakudo home pages don't seem to highlight any missing features, so is it safe to assume that Rakudo is generally considered complete and up-to-date, and that anything described in the Perl 6 docs should be expected to work in Rakudo?

[16:38] <El_Che> batmanaod[m]: I would say, expect things to work except if documented otherwise

[18:03] <jmerelo> Just talked to antoniogamiz, he's started classes and also moved to a new apartment... without internet.

[18:03] <jmerelo> I haven't had a lot of time to check your PRs and issues in documentable either, just came back from Vienna, and busy with the beginning of classes here

[18:04] <tbrowder> i’m having success with an upcoming PR to improve Documentable (but consider a bit betaish, will need to discuss some things).

[18:04] <jmerelo> It will get better in a week or two, I expect.

[18:18] <Demos[m]> so I asked a while ago if I could write new representations in perl6 ... and the answer is no. I was wondering if I can do it if I'm willing to depend on moar internals

[18:18] <Demos[m]> but still in perl6 instead of nqp

[18:18] <Demos[m]> and if I need to write it in nqp can it live anywhere or does it require explicit registration in moarvm

[18:18] <Demos[m]>  * so I asked a while ago if I could write new representations in perl6 ... and the answer is no. I was wondering if I can do it if I'm willing to depend on moar internals

[18:18] <Demos[m]> and if I need to write it in nqp can it live anywhere or does it require explicit registration in rakudo

[18:18] <timotimo> representations are written in C, not in nqp

[18:19] <timotimo> moar allows new representations to be registered, and the extension library feature still exists, even though we want to get rid of it

[18:20] <Demos[m]> are those different features?

[18:20] <Demos[m]> also I take it src/6model/reps is where to look

[18:20] <timotimo> yeah, those are the existing reprs

[18:21] <timotimo> i think src/6model/reprs.h has the function that allows a new repr to be registered

[18:21] <Demos[m]> right, so is that function the "extension library" feature?

[18:24] <timotimo> no, that is used by passing a commandline argument to "moar"

[20:09] <timotimo> you'll just not have jit

[20:09] <Elronnd> cool

[20:09] <timotimo> but you will have spesh

[20:09] <AlexDaniel> it's definitely usable just not blazing fast

[20:09] <Elronnd> what's the speed like without jit?

[20:09] <timotimo> which is a part of what other VMs would call jit

[20:09] <Elronnd> what's spesh?

[20:09] <timotimo> dynamic specializer

[20:09] <Elronnd> ahh

[20:09] <timotimo> compare running your program vs MVM_JIT_DISABLE=1 in the env

[20:10] <Elronnd> that's like, if I have &sub($x), generating a specialized version of &sub that takes just Ints if I call it with Ints a lot?
