[06:09] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: no. I'm not in UK, and honestly can't afford to travel right now :)

[06:10] <SmokeMachine> That’s not right now... that’s in 1 month...

[06:10] <AlexDaniel> I mean, during this period of my life :)

[06:10] <SmokeMachine> I’d like to know you...

[06:11] <AlexDaniel> I haven't been to *any* conference yet, actually. I was thinking maybe fosdem, but now… maybe fosdem 2020 :)

[06:11] <SmokeMachine> I’d like to know you, jjmerelo, lizmat, jnhtn, and zoffix...

[06:12] <AlexDaniel> yeah, I'd love to meet people

[06:12] <SmokeMachine> And a lot of people of this channel (I know zoffix isn’t on this channel anymore...)

[06:22] *** someuser left
[06:22] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: it's a technical issue. Zoffix no longer wants to maintain their modules, so we are trying to transfer them to perl6-community-modules, but they can't do that without being in perl6-community-modules org, which is something moritz can fix…

[06:26] *** kurahaupo left
[06:27] *** kurahaupo joined
[06:27] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: wouldn’t be a way to solve that try to make zoffix change his mind?

[06:28] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: yes, but

[06:28] <AlexDaniel> .seen Zoffix

[06:28] <yoleaux> I saw Zoffix 6 Jan 2019 17:41Z in #perl6: <Zoffix> moritz: the project's direction and management style doesn't match my goals and I'll be happier elsewhere.

[06:29] <AlexDaniel> the problem is that for most of the things Zoffix *was* our management, except we never explicitly declared it

[06:30] <AlexDaniel> and this created all sorts of problems, e.g. Zoffix having their hands tied for some things unnecessarily

[06:30] <AlexDaniel> and then some people dismissing their efforts and bullying them for no good reason

[06:31] <SmokeMachine> I agree...

[06:32] <AlexDaniel> anyway, my point is that there's no point asking Zoffix to come back right now because we didn't fix anything

[06:32] <SmokeMachine> And some people blaming him to something that this people thought was wrong...

[06:33] <AlexDaniel> however… afaik lizmat, jnthn and TimToady are discussing things

[06:33] <SmokeMachine> I think that if he saw that was people on his side... that wouldn’t happen...

[09:12] <AlexDaniel> moritz: there should be a button https://screenshots.firefox.com/0GJ84QevcozaafWV/github.com

[09:12] <moritz> I'm looking through the settings now

[09:13] <AlexDaniel> “Only organization owners can invite users to join the organization”

[09:14] <AlexDaniel> unless they introduced some new setting

[09:15] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: you seem to be "member". You should have been listed as "owner" to do so, I guess.

[09:15] <moritz> AlexDaniel: please try again (reload)

[09:16] <moritz> I've followed the instructions on https://help.github.com/articles/giving-team-maintainer-permissions-to-an-organization-member/

[09:16] <moritz> I though I could give member management privs to a whole team, but it doesn't look like it

[09:16] <moritz> *thought

[09:16] <jmerelo> moritz: probably that only allows to add people to that particular team

[09:17] <AlexDaniel> moritz: no, nothing, and that's a different thing I think

[09:18] <AlexDaniel> it's about managing a team, not an organization

[09:18] <AlexDaniel> ah wait… hold on

[09:18] <AlexDaniel> yes, I'm correct :)

[09:19] <AlexDaniel> so I can add people to the team as long as they're already in the organization

[09:19] <AlexDaniel> otherwise it says “Not a member of this organization” if I attempt to add someone

[09:20] <moritz> AlexDaniel: please try yet again :)

[09:21] <AlexDaniel> yes, now I can do things!

[09:35] <jmerelo> But I'm all for credit where credit is due, so I'll say it's your idea.

[09:36] *** ravenousmoose joined
[09:37] <jmerelo> BTW, 3 less, great job :-)

[09:38] <AlexDaniel> mostly not my achievement :)

[09:38] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I think the way to come up with some good project ideas is to think what sucks in perl 6

[09:39] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: well, I'm not too happy about documentation tooling. That's one of the things I have inserted

[09:39] <AlexDaniel> like argument parsing sucks, so that's what we're writing down now… unicode support used to suck, but then samcv got rid of any potential for a gsoc project ♥

[09:39] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: the ecosystem is also problematic. There's a lot of impedance between zef, modules.perl6.org, and specs.

[09:40] <AlexDaniel> hmm

[09:40] <AlexDaniel> maybe ping ugexe?

[09:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: the simple fact that there's only one module manager (one-ish) also sucks. I'd like to see a new one.

[09:40] <AlexDaniel> NEW ONE?

[09:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: that has proved not very fruitful in the past.

[09:40] <AlexDaniel> ok, first of all, we had panda…

[09:40] <AlexDaniel> then we said that panda sucks and switched to zef

[09:40] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: right. It's not working now.

[09:41] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: there's a lot of potential in zef, actually. It's an impressive piece of work. Most of what you would like to be there, is there.

[09:41] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I think it's a good topic in general, but I don't know what exactly needs to be improved. ugexe definitely knows, try talking to them

[09:41] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: as I said, not very fruitful in the past.

[09:42] <AlexDaniel> ahhh, I see

[09:42] <AlexDaniel> nine?

[09:42] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: (also, niner is also involved)

[09:42] *** ravenousmoose is now known as ravenousmoose[aw

[09:42] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: see all my issues in zef https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/created_by/JJ. A very naïve, and hopeful, "Include more information on failure" was simply ignored.

[09:43] <AlexDaniel> jnthn: gsoc project? Maybe something related to improving the startup time (which sucks), as long as there's a hardcore student interested in that…

[09:43] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: I think I'm going to include all those issues as a GSoC idea. "Do something that is just like zef, except for... "

[09:43] *** ravenousmoose[aw left
[09:44] <AlexDaniel> I think zef itself can be improved, no need to reinvent

[09:44] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: as I said, most of the potential is there. I was thinking more along the lines of forking it, eliminating and adding stuff.

[09:44] <samcv> AlexDaniel, <3

[09:44] <yoleaux> 23 Jan 2019 21:21Z <MasterDuke> samcv: the code is a bit complicated, not entirely sure how to un-todo it

[09:45] <AlexDaniel> samcv: but is there something else that can be improved?

[09:45] <samcv> well.

[09:45] <samcv> i'm not sure i'm still working on my ideas for things i could be the mentor for

[09:45] <tyil> the modules website, but I'm preparing for that already

[09:45] <jmerelo> For instance, isomorphismes was talking yesterday about searching in the "description" field using zef search. It so happens you can't do that, but just because the user-facing function can't. The library function is actually prepared for it.

[09:45] <samcv> nice

[09:46] <jmerelo> tyil: modules.perl6.org you mean?

[09:46] <jmerelo> Anyway, you two are going to be mentors, right?

[09:46] <tyil> jmerelo: yes

[09:46] <AlexDaniel> oo that's nice

[09:46] <samcv> yeah i'm planning on it. i must come up with some ideas though

[09:46] <samcv> been very busy as i moved to amsterdam. and now have to move again into my actual apartment

[09:47] <samcv> after finding a place etc so many things :)

[09:47] <tyil> samcv: same

[09:47] <samcv> eventually it will all get done though

[09:47] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: btw they recommend having an up-to-date list of things to work on

[09:47] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: like, so that we're not writing down projects for gsoc, but that we have these projects all year round

[09:47] <samcv> at minimum i would put down decoding some of the chinese encodings

[09:47] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: we do have the issues.

[09:48] <samcv> that's the largest thing i haven't implemented yet

[09:48] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: I don't remember, somewhere in mentor guides

[09:48] <tyil> documentation is all year round :D

[09:48] <jmerelo> AlexDaniel: project ideas will point at issues, actually.

[09:48] <samcv> as far as encoding/decoding. also. they could work at refactoring the encode/decode code

[09:48] <samcv> so that decode and decodestream use the same decoding paths

[09:48] <jmerelo> samcv: can you please add that to the ideas repo?

[09:48] <samcv> yeah i will now while you have my mind :)

[09:49] <samcv> link to the repo just for my ease?

[09:49] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: it's fine to point at issues, as long as you have a separate project description… but generally I think it's a good idea to have that list and maintain in

[09:49] <tyil> samcv: https://github.com/perl-gsoc-2019/ideas/tree/master/perl6

[09:49] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: i.e. “if you want to help, here's a list of big-ish things you can do and these are the people you need to contact”

[09:49] <samcv> so one file per idea?

[09:49] <tyil> seems like it

[09:49] <jmerelo> samcv: right

[09:50] <samcv> and by the date we submit we should have at least one mentor who is able to take the project on. though we can add ideas before then and find mentor in the mean time

[09:50] <jmerelo> samcv: we need to list one mentor per idea. I'm kind of dodging that by saying "One of the Perl 6 mentors"

[09:51] <tyil> I like the improvement for TLS (OpenSSL module) project, client certs would be neat to have

[09:51] <jmerelo> tyil: we'll add you as a mentor :-)

[09:51] <tyil> woah

[09:51] <tyil> I wouldn't mind being a mentor, but I don't know if I have what it takes 

[09:52] <jmerelo> I think we all have what it takes.

[09:52] <tyil> I'm not that great (cpan-p6 still has memory issues, for instance)

[09:52] <tyil> I'm more than willing to try and help out, though :)

[09:52] <jmerelo> What we have is the will to enlarge the community and get some coders into the Perl 6 pool, and get Google to pay the organization so that we can continue to fund development.

[09:53] <jmerelo> (If I remember correctly, Google pays 50K to the organization, 5K per student)

[10:00] <samcv> but was cool meeting someone who knew what MoarVM was :)

[10:01] <El_Che> Flávio? A very nice guy

[10:01] <samcv> yeah

[10:02] <samcv> jmerelo, is there someone handling the perl5 ones? or is it you

[10:02] <samcv> because. i may be able to find some poeple willing to be a mentor at my work. i'll try to put out an APB to possible people

[10:02] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: good news!

[10:04] <samcv> jmerelo, pushed my writeup there

[10:12] <jmerelo> samcv: they are in the same repo. Mark Keating is kinda the Perl 5 head, but for the time being there's nothing in that area.

[10:23] *** admin__ left
[10:23] <pmurias> jmerelo: I'm not sure the 50k$ is payed to the organisation (I think that ~5k is paid to students directly) 

[10:25] <jmerelo> pmurias: Probably. Maybe the thing was that a max of 10 students per organization, to the tune of 5k, were accepted.

[10:25] *** ravenousmoose joined
[10:25] <jmerelo> pmurias: I'll check anyway. 

[10:26] *** lizmat joined
[10:27] <jmerelo> pmurias: apparently yes, it's paid according to the number of mentors and students it gets: https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/org-payments

[10:28] <jmerelo> pmurias: the FAQ also states 500€ per student. So yes, maybe not 50k, but still good dinero.

[10:30] <pmurias> well the money handed to students also sort of counts as going into Perl 6 development

[10:30] <jmerelo> pmurias: that's right. It's win-win.

[10:31] *** pmurias left
[10:31] <jmerelo> samcv: it's jjmerelo at gmail. Also jjmerelo in Twitter, you can dm me. Or in Telegram. 

[10:31] *** pmurias joined
[10:31] <jmerelo> It's win-win if your organization is chosen.

[10:32] <pmurias> samcv: colaborating with Flavio (fglock) on the Perl6-to-Perl5 stuff was fun back in the day, he kid of drifted from the community radar as he is not on irc anymore

[11:25] <quad_> hi

[11:25] <moritz> ho

[11:25] <quad_> how can I see what moar does?

[11:25] <quad_> print the generated code

[11:25] <quad_> different stages of compilation

[11:25] <quad_> to follow it

[11:27] <quad_> well?

[11:27] <moritz> so, rakudo is the compiler, not MoarVM

[11:27] <moritz> moar doesn't have traditional compilation stages

[11:27] <moritz> it works on bytecode, and can do things like specializations, inlining and JIT on the fly, but not in stages

[11:28] <moritz> you can get a whole lot of debugging output out of MoarVM by doing a debug build, with Configure.pl --debug

[11:29] <moritz> quad_: does that answer your question?

[11:29] *** pmurias joined
[11:29] <quad_> yes

[11:29] <quad_> how can I print the byte code?

[11:30] <quad_> mbv

[11:30] <quad_> mbc

[11:30] <moritz> perl6 --target=mbc ... # iirc

[11:30] *** pmurias left
[11:30] <quad_> I cannot read it that

[11:31] <moritz> but you want the byte code, no? :D

[11:31] <quad_> In a viewable format

[11:31] <quad_> understandable

[11:32] <moritz> you can get an intermediate view with --target=mast

[11:32] <moritz> I don't know if there's a bytecode dumper for moar -- maybe the folks in #moarvm know more

[11:33] <quad_> I get an error I cannot stringify this

[11:35] <moritz> I cannot stringify this either :(

[11:36] <quad_> have you tried the command you recommended me?

[11:40] <moritz> yes, worked for me with -e 'say 1'

[11:41] *** ravenousmoose[aw is now known as ravenousmoose

[11:41] *** ravenousmoose is now known as ravenousmoose[aw

[11:42] <moritz> have you tried without --output ?

[11:45] *** aborazmeh left
[11:45] *** aborazmeh joined
[11:45] <quad_> can I see the code produced by moar?  jit?

[11:45] <timotimo> moar --dump can give you what's in a .moarvm file, but only the bytecode

[11:46] <timotimo> you'll need to use --target=mbc for that

[11:47] <timotimo> setting the env var MVM_SPESH_LOG to a filename will also give you bytecode from functions that are deemed hot enough for optimization

[11:47] <timotimo> that will give you functions in a SSA form, which is a bit nicer to read, too

[14:19] *** sena_kun joined
[14:27] <araraloren> Can someone help me check is my code using lock/unlock of IO::Handle in right way ?

[14:27] <araraloren> https://gist.github.com/araraloren/cfb7d7b694be76e0bbe53491df573d3a#file-test-p6

[14:28] <araraloren> It's a simple plug-in framework

[14:28] <araraloren> Currently the test code sometimes hang on or segmentfault

[14:31] *** zacts joined
[14:38] <sena_kun> araraloren, $!lock.lock is likely to not be atomic.

[14:38] <sena_kun> I think you want make your class a monitor.

[14:39] <araraloren> oh, it's not thead safe ?

[14:39] <sena_kun> I am not an expert tho, but I'd opt to monitor usage in this case to avoid races by replacing a single keyword. :)

[14:39] <sena_kun> why should it be?

[14:40] <timotimo> i'm confused by your assessment

[14:40] <timotimo> but i'd recommend Lock::protect over Lock::lock and Lock::unlock

[14:41] <sena_kun> timotimo, filehandle lock is used instead of Lock.

[14:41] <sena_kun> that's why it might be confusing, I think.

[14:41] <sena_kun> and lock/unlock on a file doesn't do anything related to threads.

[14:41] <timotimo> oh

[14:41] <timotimo> that makes a big difference, yes

[14:42] <sena_kun> so either use a global Lock or a monitor.

[14:42] <araraloren> I thought it would like flock in C

[14:43] <araraloren> Anything can work in serval process ?

[14:43] <sena_kun> this is where I cannot help. :S

[14:43] <araraloren>   or thread

[14:43] <sena_kun> araraloren, "anything" is?

[14:44] <araraloren> such as the IO::Hanle.lock/unlock

[14:44] *** mowcat joined
[14:44] <sena_kun> hmm, I might be wrong.

[14:45] <sena_kun> >otherwise will block until the lock can be placed

[14:45] <sena_kun> from docs

[14:45] <araraloren> Oh, actually I want the module work in mulitple Process or Thread

[14:46] <araraloren> yeah, I think it would work here

[14:46] <araraloren> but it's not

[14:47] <sena_kun> then we want someone with more experience to explain why it doesn't. sorry.

[18:34] <quad_> hello

[18:34] <quad_> is anybody using Perl6 in the commercial world?

[18:35] * sjn knows of a company that uses Perl 6 to write some of it's backend tooling

[18:36] <sjn> quad_: are you thinking of something specific?

[18:37] <timotimo> edument is using perl6 for something related to agriculture, there were one or two talks about it at a recent-ish perl conference/workshop

[18:38] <timotimo> nine's team has been using perl6 at their workplace for a while and if i remember correctly they've been transitioning more and more tools/daemons/scripts to perl6

[18:42] *** leont joined
[18:46] <quad_> there is too much competition

[18:47] <quad_> a lot of languages

[18:47] <El_Che> The time of dominant languages is gone

[18:47] <quad_> Java?

[18:48] <El_Che> is popular, but far from dominant

[18:48] <quad_> Javascirpt

[18:49] <El_Che> maybe on on the frontend, but not on the backend

[18:49] <quad_> where do you get you information from?

[18:49] <sjn> quad_: What are you specifically competing on? Adoption? Fitfulness for a specific purpose? Execution speed? Development speed? Code->run->error->code feedback loop tightness? Hype?

[18:49] <El_Che> most languages in the backend are interchangeable, certainly in a time of microservices and containers

[18:50] <quad_> Execution speed. Development speed. Code->run->error->code feedback loop tightness.

[18:50] <El_Che> quad_: own experience, colleagues, people I know, ecosystems, conferences, the yearly polls and garner-line (grain of salt) market research

[18:51] <sjn> quad_: tell us what you think is important, and we'll give you our honest answer on how we think Perl 6 measures up there :)

[18:51] <El_Che> Depends which one you want, e.g. python has a tighter dev loop, but go is *way* faster

[18:51] <El_Che> so, it's all very relative

[18:51] <timotimo> go is only *way* faster if you're using CPython, fwiw :)

[18:52] <El_Che> timotimo: there is a reasons the alternatives in the python families haven't broken trough in the Python world

[18:52] <El_Che> s/is a/are/

[18:53] <sjn> quad_: Perl 6 isn't really good on the execution speed part, but if you have a fast C library, the foreign function interface is quite good so you can still make use of a fast library from Perl 6

[18:53] <El_Che> pretty much like python and ruby people have to use when they need speed

[18:55] <sjn> quad_: As for development speed, Perl 6 is doing pretty good, IMO. Upside it's a *very* high level language with fantastic error messages and quite decent tracing tools, but the learning curve is quite steep as the language is very large (although this is partially remedied by good reuse of some programming patterns)

[18:56] *** zacts left
[18:57] <quad_> yes

[18:57] <sjn> quad_: the code-run-error-code feedback loop is pretty decent, but kinda dependant on the environment you're running in. others here may be better than me to give details, but I've seen very fast development from basic proof-of-concept to well structured OO+Roles in very short time

[18:58] <sjn> Perl 6 has some really neat features when it comes to growing a project over time

[19:00] <quad_> I also like to be able to producr executables

[19:00] <quad_> and good development environemtn

[19:00] <sjn> personally, I'd give the speed of Perl 6 (at the moment) maybe 4/10. There's still lots that can be improved, and fortunately a bunch of people are actively working on this as we speak

[19:00] <quad_> good debugging facilities

[19:00] <quad_> biggest competitor is Perl 5 for me

[19:02] <sjn> quad_: starting a Perl 6 project in 2019 is a pretty safe thing, I think, especially if execution speed isn't very important. Over time, expect that your code will go faster just because of improvements in the VM

[19:02] <sjn> quad_: if you need to produce executables, Perl 6 (or Perl 5, really) isn't your thing. 

[19:03] <quad_> yes

[19:03] <sjn> in fact, a VM with a well-tuned JIT outperforms compiled code these days (although Perl6 isn't there yet, other languages with more mature VM's are)

[19:03] <sjn> we'll get there eventually :)

[19:04] <timotimo> yeah, i think that's been the case for a couple of years now

[19:04] <timotimo> maybe even ten?

[19:04] <quad_> what language has the best jit nowadays?

[19:05] <sjn> as for development environment, you may want to take a look at Comma, a Perl 6 IDE that Edument are making. That one has refactoring support even, but while still being in beta, I hear good things of it (haven't tried it myself though)

[19:06] <sjn> quad_: Java's JRE is veery mature, and with some careful crafting can produce lightningly fast code

[19:07] <quad_> then,,,,oerl6 having java output was good

[19:07] <timotimo> i'm not sure if luajit is ahead of or behind java right now, but i seem to recall it was incredibly fast as well

[19:08] <timotimo> and then there's the javascript VM that more and more work is being poured into every day

[19:08] <quad_> sjn: what crafting?

[19:08] <timotimo> but since people are still super excited about wasm and such, it's probably not at the same level as java JRE

[19:08] <sjn> quad_: careful use of typing, for example

[19:08] <quad_> what happened to Perl 6 java backend?

[19:09] *** sena_kun left
[19:09] <timotimo> lack of volunteers to keep it fresh

[19:09] <moritz> bitrot

[19:11] <sjn> quad_: a problem with the "execution speed" thing is that if you want things to go really fast you have to "go native" and depend on some pretty crazy CPU and caching features

[19:12] <sjn> if your problem domain doesn't mind this, then go ahead :)

[19:14] <sjn> it helps to be honest about how important execution speed actually is. if you're doing large-scale simulations, you may want to pick another language/toolchain

[19:14] <sjn> if you're making public-facing network services that can't be cached, then pick something else than Perl 6

[19:15] <quad_> simulation it is

[19:17] <sjn> For CPU-heavy (or CUDA/etc hardware) simulations, I would probably pick another language at the moment

[19:18] <sjn> Haven't heard of anyone working on making those things faster, though I can't claim to know everything that's going on here :)

[19:19] <sjn> quad_: if speed is important, there's another Perl 6 option though :)

[19:20] *** KDr2 left
[19:20] <sjn> quad_: Implement what you need in Perl 6, make sure to report your findings here, and help make Perl 6 faster :-D

[19:20] *** reach_satori_ joined
[19:21] <timotimo> yeah, it's not totally uncommon that specific speed deficiencies get patched up in half a day

[19:21] <sjn> it's all volunteer work (like most Open Source projects), so taking charge of improving a featureset is something lots of people will appreciate :)

[19:21] <timotimo> well, it's like 80% volunteer work

[19:22] <quad_> yes, I know

[19:22] <sjn> so in some ways, asking "what is popular" or "best" isn't the best question to ask in #perl6 – it's better to ask "what features/qualities do I need, and how can I help improve these"

[19:23] *** satori__ left
[19:23] <sjn> there's still enough to improve that this way of thinking can give lots of benefits

[19:24] *** Manifest0 left

[19:24] <sjn> but it assumes that the other things (dev speed, feedback/debug/dev loop, language features) are good enough for your needs

[19:30] <sjn> we're glad to share opinions, but if you want to make a more informed decision it helps to be specific :)

[20:03] *** sena_kun joined
[20:03] <sjn> are you talking about Moar's abstrat syntax tree, or about an encoding? (I'm not enough into the guts of MoarVM, but I'm pretty sure "encoding" isn't the right word to use here. I might be wrong though)

[23:03] <TreyHarris> What's my best bet for a library if I just want to get latitude and longitude of major cities for doing astronomical calculations? The ones in ecosystem appear to all be either deprecated or for for-pay services without a (non-trial) free tier. (There's a weather module that can return coordinates for cities, but it's quite old and this seems like a silly way to go about it.) I'm fine using an Inline or a

[23:03] <TreyHarris> simple JSON API if that's the best way to go about it

[23:04] <TreyHarris> I don't need anything fancy in terms of the Perl 5 Geo::Coder::... modules' capabilities

[23:04] <timotimo> have you considered openstreetmap?

[23:04] *** lizmat left
[23:05] <TreyHarris> timotimo: I was considering using either it or Geo::Coder::Free using inline perl5,  but I've never had this need before so I don't know how to assess one over another

[23:05] <timotimo> i haven't needed something like this before either

[23:05] <TreyHarris> I'll give openstreetmap a try

[23:05] <hahainternet> i've used geonames for this, just a downloadable database

[23:06] <hahainternet> not sure how their webservice fares

[23:06] <TreyHarris> hahainternet: ah? let me take a look.

[23:07] <TreyHarris> OpenCage has a free tier and there's a native Perl6 library, but it doesn't work

[23:08] <hahainternet> TreyHarris: yeah, although i don't know of any useful modules to help i'm afraid

[23:08] <TreyHarris> (Seems like an issue for a lot of these in Perl 5, too: the module doesn't work with the current API.)

[23:09] <hahainternet> (always add a version path or use http facilities to version your APIs :p)

[23:09] <TreyHarris> hahainternet: do you have a link? I'm clicking around but not finding the downloadable database

[23:10] <TreyHarris> Oh, nm, I'm blind. http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/

[23:11] <hahainternet> there are some collections too with different levels of detail

[23:11] <hahainternet> if you want the top 50,000 cities for example

[23:12] <hahainternet> ah, lower on that same page in fact :)
