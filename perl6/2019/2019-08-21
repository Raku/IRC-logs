[00:04] <irced> nope, it's not the bind operator issue. seems to be an issue with passing by value into different functions. maybe i can pass by reference?

[08:27] <scimon> So I'm finding some of the recent comments in the renaming thread confusing.

[08:28] <scimon> When exactly are you going to have production code which needs to run the most recent version of perl6 (or whatever) (because if you stick to an old version the name doesn't matter) but you can't spend the time to change the shebang line? 

[08:28] <scimon> Seems a very contrived example.

[08:29] <El_Che> my thoughts exactly

[08:29] <El_Che> it's not like it will be a big bang tomorrow

[08:47] *** [particle]1 joined
[08:49] <lizmat> so, what would be reasons to *not* treat the rename of Perl 6 as a fork ?

[08:49] *** [particle] left
[08:50] *** ravenousmoose left
[08:50] <SmokeMachine> fork++

[08:50] <SmokeMachine> lizmat++

[08:51] <El_Che> lizmat: because you may end with forked communities?

[08:52] <lizmat> that could be one, yes...  but I'd like to see the fork as a purely technical solution, not as something that would be needed from the community

[08:52] <El_Che> I get your motivation

[08:52] <El_Che> but it's an extra risk

[08:53] <El_Che> that wasn't there on the original proposal

[08:53] <El_Che> while the risks for "backward compatibility" are exagerated

[08:53] <lizmat> for the moment I'm just brainstorming

[08:53] <El_Che> like scimon states

[08:53] <lizmat> the advantage would be that current users would need to opt-in for the name change

[08:53] <lizmat> rather than it being forced upon them

[08:54] <El_Che> of course there are risks with a renaming, but backwards compatibility isn't one of them is handled right

[08:54] <El_Che> add a perl6 link for a year

[08:54] <El_Che> solved

[08:54] <scimon> fork-- 

[08:54] <scimon> Epp

[08:54] <lizmat> I guess we will need more than a year

[08:54] <El_Che> if you run old code with an old compiler no problem there

[08:55] <lizmat> scimon: Epp ?

[08:55] <El_Che> if you maintain your project you have a big windows to make the 1 line change

[08:55] <scimon> I think we're in a much better place to do a rename than a fork. Really we're at the start of the journey. Forking things now would just end up with 3 groups all of whom don't like each other.

[08:55] <scimon> (That should have been Eeep a small squeak of fear.)

[08:56] *** squashable6 left
[08:56] <scimon> Perl5 people angry at the remaining Perl6 people. Perl6 people angry at the Raku (or whatever people)... and Raku people sad because of all the anger.

[08:56] <El_Che> if you get 2 repos/project that are updated individually we don't solve the problem we wanted to fix

[08:57] <El_Che> Perl 6 is still squatting the Perl name (and Perl 5 people still pissed at us)

[08:57] *** veesh1 joined
[08:57] <SmokeMachine> As I understood, the fork would not fork the community, just the language... and the oldone would be "abandoned"...

[08:57] <scimon> Sure there is some Perl6 in production but any there is must surely be able to be updated before it's an issue.

[08:57] <El_Che> and Perl 6 still lives in a marketing nightmare

[08:57] <lizmat> El_Che: good point wrt squatting

[08:57] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: "would"

[08:57] <scimon> But if there's a fork some people would pick up the "abandoned" one 

[08:58] *** squashable6 joined
[08:58] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v squashable6

[08:58] <El_Che> lizmat: I see your proposal not only as the only way forward for Perl 6 but also as a healing gesture for the wider Perl community, explicitly acknowledging what Perl 5 people want/need.

[08:59] <El_Che> and the forking weakens your proposal on the core idea

[08:59] <scimon> Yup

[08:59] <scimon> Yup again

[08:59] <SmokeMachine> scimon: yes... you are probably right...

[08:59] <scimon> Yay it's a blue moon ;)

[09:00] <SmokeMachine> El_Che: makes sense...

[09:00] <SmokeMachine> fork-- :(

[09:00] <aearnus[m]> on top of everything else: if there's some band of people that don't like it, the language will still be open source when everything is said and done. That band can fork the language and call it whatever they want

[09:00] <lizmat> ok, enough about the fork idea, it's bad, stricken from the replies

[09:01] <lizmat> sorry for the noise

[09:01] <El_Che> aearnus[m]: exactly, but only after the name-version situation is resolved.

[09:01] <El_Che> lizmat: no sorries needed, glad to be a sounding board

[09:34] <SmokeMachine> would that be possible to create a tool that changes a module source code to fix everything needed to the rename? (extensions, .perl, Perl::, etc)

[09:35] <SmokeMachine> META6.json

[09:36] *** domidumont left
[09:36] <lizmat> we need to keep the name "META6.json" unless we want to lose compatibility with PAUSE

[09:36] <lizmat> and that would be bad

[09:37] <lizmat> but, yes, such a tool should be relatively easy to make, or even be made part of something like App::MI6

[09:37] <moritz> I think SmokeMachine meant that META6.json should be updated to reflect the changes

[09:38] <lizmat> ah, ok  :-)  *phew*

[09:38] <lizmat> things like App::MI6 already read and write the META6.json file anyway...

[09:39] *** zakharyas left
[09:39] <SmokeMachine> maybe even the tool could automatically open PRs...

[09:39] <lizmat> as far as I can see, the tool only would need to rename files found in the META6.json and then change the META6.json itself accordingly

[09:41] <SmokeMachine> lizmat: change any call to .perl to .raku, any use of the Perl namespace, perl variable, :from<Perl5> to :from<Perl>, etc...

[09:42] <lizmat> SmokeMachine: should probably be made into a separate module, so that other apps (like Comma) could make use of it as well

[11:41] <moritz> because it's the Comprehensive *Perl* Archive Network

[11:41] <moritz> the idea, yes

[11:41] *** lichtkind_ joined
[11:42] <moritz> but the problem is that if we drop "Perl" from the name, some people will interpret that as "it's not perl anymore"

[11:42] <moritz> so people from the Perl 5 community rejecting Raku in parts of the infrastructure is a credible risk

[11:42] <El_Che> those people reject Perl 6 already as not Perl, don't they?

[11:42] <moritz> heck, even with "Perl" in the name, there were regular discussions on perlmonks whether Perl 6 questions belonged to perlmonks

[11:42] <moritz> El_Che: maybe, but they'll have a new lever

[11:44] *** lichtkind left
[11:47] <El_Che> I think that renaming will take the big lever away

[11:48] <moritz> previously, the discussion was "do we really need Perl 6 questions on perlmonks? they annoy me" -- "yes, Perl 6 is Perl. It's even in the name" -- "OK, guess I can't do much about it, I'll ignore it"

[11:50] <moritz> after a rename, it will continue as "yes, Raku is still Perl, *despite* the name" -- "No way, Raku dropped 'Perl' from the name, go away from perlmonks"

[11:50] <El_Che> moritz: that's a reasonable Perl6 hater

[11:51] <El_Che> I mean that a lot of people don't react like that. As long Perl 6 jas the version in the name they consider it the enemy

[11:53] <El_Che> I hope that the most extreme defactor will call victory and be happy

[14:19] <Doc_Holliwood> I'm scratching my head here guys. I am trying to output "ö" in a Windows console. I set the codepage to 1252 and do .encode("utf-8").decode("windows-1252").say; ( see https://pastebin.com/caNYgdFG ) but the console still thinks it's unicode

[14:19] <sena_kun> m: sub a(*&a) {}; &a.signature.params[0].sigil.say;

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «&␤»

[14:19] *** BuildTheRobots joined
[14:20] <Doc_Holliwood> This works as it should in Perl 5: use utf8; use Encode; print encode("iso-8859-1","ö");

[14:21] <Doc_Holliwood> Do I have to tell Perl somehow that STDOUT is not unicode?

[14:22] <huf> doesnt decode() decode? if so, why are you decoding from windows codepage instead of encoding to it?

[14:26] <Doc_Holliwood> If I understand that right, no. that should encode from the utf-8 ( 246.char ) to "normal form" and decode that to latin-1

[14:27] <AlexDaniel> Doc_Holliwood: you might need to reopen $*OUT with a different encoding

[14:27] *** pmurias joined
[14:28] <Grinnz> that's not what encode and decode mean.

[14:28] <Grinnz> you encode *to* a character encoding and decode *from* it

[14:29] <Grinnz> and 246.char is not utf-8, it's a character

[14:30] <Grinnz> I assume the details here are utf-8 oriented, so you need to change stdout to do cp1252 instead like AlexDaniel said

[14:30] <Grinnz> er, defaults

[14:30] <Doc_Holliwood> it's not a character. it's a Str

[14:30] <Grinnz> I am speaking in the Unicode sense

[14:30] <Doc_Holliwood> m: 246.char.WHAT.say

[14:30] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «No such method 'char' for invocant of type 'Int'. Did you mean any of these?␤    can␤    chars␤    chop␤    chr␤␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[14:31] <Doc_Holliwood> m: 246.chr.WHAT.say

[14:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «(Str)␤»

[14:31] <Grinnz> it is not encoded to utf-8.

[14:31] <Grinnz> it is not encoded to anything

[14:31] <Grinnz> the output would encode it to utf-8 by default (again, assuming I understand correctly)

[14:32] <AlexDaniel> m: $*OUT = $*OUT.open: enc => ‘windows-1252’; say ‘œ’

[14:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar ecf2b1e4f: OUTPUT: «\x9C␤»

[14:32] <AlexDaniel> e: $*OUT = $*OUT.open: enc => ‘windows-1252’; say ‘œ’

[14:32] <evalable6> AlexDaniel, rakudo-moar cd8463a85: OUTPUT: «􏿽x9C␤»

[14:33] <AlexDaniel> that seems to work?

[14:33] <Grinnz> you need to have the output encode to cp1252 because that's what your terminal expects. most terminals in unix land expect utf-8

[14:34] <Grinnz> as well as irc

[14:34] <Doc_Holliwood> I see

[14:34] <Doc_Holliwood> $*OUT.encoding("latin-1"); did the trick, I don't need to encode or decode anything, I can just .say

[14:35] <Grinnz> note that latin1 is missing a bunch of characters from cp1252. so make sure to use the latter if you want those

[15:27] <Doc_Holliwood> Is there a way to alias native types? so I can for example write "sub foo(BOOL, DWORD) is native yada yada" instead of "sub foo(uint32, int32)"?

[15:27] <Doc_Holliwood> I tried inheriting from them but apparently that isn't supported

[15:29] <AlexDaniel> m: constant \x := uint32; sub foo(x, int32) {}; dd &foo

[15:32] <Doc_Holliwood> ty

[15:36] <Doc_Holliwood> this is a syntax error, sadly. constant \LPDWORD := uint32 is rw; But I guess I can live with DWORD is rw in the signature instead :-D

[18:10] <[Coke]> ... this is lo!

[18:10] <[Coke]> nger than I thought!

[18:12] <woolfy1> It is indeed quite long.  It is even less coherent than I wanted.  I am not capable of coherent when it comes to the name of Perl 6.

[18:12] <woolfy1> But since I don't have a vote in this issue, I can merely blog.  Still, I am trying to help lizmat...

[18:14] <lizmat> Once upon a time in Hollywood&

[18:17] <Grinnz> woolfy1: It makes me sad to read the ending. And I'm sorry the discussions cause you such grief. But no matter how much you want Perl 6 to be the successor of Perl 5, it is directly in conflict with what a *lot* of people want, and with what the languages are now in design and intent. And as long as the names are misrepresenting that relationship, people will continue to hate the other community, and it's destructive and antithetical

[18:17] <Grinnz> to the relationship we could and should have. If Perl 6 is to replace Perl 5, it will only do so by attrition, decades in the future.

[18:17] *** ravenous_ joined
[18:21] <AlexDaniel> woolfy1: what's your handle on github?

[18:22] <El_Che> I my --probably irrelevant-- opinion, if the naming situation persists Perl 5 and 6 will loose all relevance in a few years. A now of never moment in time. (Perl will have maintenance codebase, but that will only get you so far. It also need new *modern* stuff in new major releases)

[18:22] <AlexDaniel> found it

[18:23] <El_Che> Renaming does not fix that, but it opens an opportunity, small as it may be

[18:23] <AlexDaniel> woolfy1: invitation sent, you can accept it here: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/invitations

[18:24] <AlexDaniel> woolfy1: after that you'll be able to leave comments on Raku issue/PR

[18:24] <AlexDaniel> if anybody else has something valuable to say but can't, just ping me

[18:24] <[Coke]> the items that go in Perl 5 can be new, modern things regardless.

[18:24] <El_Che> [Coke]: the most modern thing perl as added in a decade is signatures in experimental.

[18:25] <[Coke]> I do wish we had a writeup of the various detours & conversations we've already had over the last 20 years.

[18:25] <El_Che> [Coke]: but that's up to the Perl 5 people to decide where they want to go. Like I said, my irrelevant 2c

[18:25] <[Coke]> El_Che: and that has nothing to do with the name.

[18:26] <El_Che> Squatting the next major version so the whole world thinks you're dead? It a*absolutely* does.

[18:26] <Grinnz> the appearance of the ability to modernize itself has everything to do with the name.

[18:26] <[Coke]> (up to p5 people) aye. Sawyer X asked the question at the last TPC, not sure if he announced the answer.

[18:26] <El_Che> they can steal all the good features of JS, Go, Rust and .Net and still be dead because there is a slower newer version out there

[18:27] <El_Che> [Coke]: my point is that for P5, renaming is not enough

[18:27] <El_Che> [Coke]: but is a part of the solution

[18:28] <El_Che> if the major release name is freed, but Perl 5 core still misses modern OO, concurrency and a sane deployment model, the decline will not stop

[18:30] <AlexDaniel> woolfy1: yeah, the versioning is stupid

[18:30] <AlexDaniel> :)

[18:31] <AlexDaniel> I guess it was appropriate because of perl5

[18:32] <El_Che> because of reasons :)

[18:33] <El_Che> anyway, my opinion is not meant to disrespect people that have invested a lot of years on Perl 5 and 6.

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> nepugia: sounds fun

[20:09] <nepugia> absolutely

[20:17] <guifa> AlexDaniel: I wish I could have gone this year.  Hopefully going to make it next year and going to propose a talk on internationalization/localization stuff (which I should have more fleshed out by then)

[20:22] <MasterDuke> same here, mostly (wish i could have gone, going to try for next year, but not going to propose a talk on internationalization/localization stuff)

[20:25] <jdv79> AlexDaniel: it was a feature;)

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> nah

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> .tell jdv69 hello

[20:26] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I haven't seen jdv69 around, did you mean jdv79?

[20:26] <AlexDaniel> now that's a feature

[20:27] <jdv79> what if i want to send a msg to someone that hasn't been around?

[20:28] <AlexDaniel> then you wait

[20:29] <aearnus[m]> that's what email is for :^)

[21:27] <AlexDaniel> perlbot: seen AlexDaniel

[21:51] <woolfy1> Grinnz: it may come as a shock to you, and to others, but you are among the people who make me want to leave the Perl-community.  You are not an honest man, coming on this channel and promote whatever you want to promote.

[21:51] <Grinnz> I'm sorry you feel that way. I have been completely honest in what I have said.

[21:51] <woolfy1> Grinnz: you sat across Liz during the latest Perl Toolchain Summit, and did not utter a word to her, not even when she talked to you.  I witnessed it.  I spoke later to you and got a short but grumpy reply.  You seem to despise Perl 6 and I have no idea what you are doing here.

[21:52] <woolfy1> Grinnz: stop it.  You are among those Perl 5 people who want Perl 6 to go away.  You are not honest.

[21:53] <woolfy1> AlexDaniel: thanks for the invitation.  I will think about it.  Buit I think I have said what I wanted to say.

[21:53] <Grinnz> That is how I act with anyone. I know it can give the wrong impression and I'm sorry it did to you

[21:53] <woolfy1> To all: I am a bit sorry that the first thing I did, after going to the movies with lizmat and returning home, is to berate somebody who I consider to be a hypocrite.

[21:54] <Grinnz> Please don't project motivations on me. I am here because I have a vested interest in how both communities proceed, but I am happy to leave if it makes you feel better.

[21:54] <dominix> hi everyone, ... is there any plan for perl6 on Clear linux ?

[21:55] * bartolin hugs woolfy1 

[21:56] <woolfy1> Hi guifa...  I am indeed Wendy.  Woolfy is my nickname for over 20 years already...  :-)

[21:57] * woolfy1 hugz bartolin right back

[21:59] <woolfy1> Grinnz : I do not want you to go anywhere.  I just don't understand your presence here, other than that you want to be very sure that perl 6 f**ks off into the void.  And yes, I am grumpy and impolite.

[21:59] <Grinnz> I have a deep respect for what you both have contributed to the community, even though I make very clear my disagreements. I hope the discussion can continue with the respect it had in the issue.

[21:59] <woolfy1> Plus, I am not the one to make such a decision.

[21:59] <woolfy1> Nope, that ship has sailed for me.

[21:59] * woolfy1 exit...

[22:00] <El_Che> woolfy1: Grinnz has been very polite and constructive, I don't think conflict is needed

[22:04] <Grinnz> If she wants me to say that I only care what happens with Perl 6 in as much as it will affect Perl, the language and the name, then I will say that. that doesn't mean it has to be an adversarial concern.

[22:19] <pmurias> what happened with our Perl 6 GSoC projects?

[22:19] <pmurias> I have only seen reports for the self contained executable ones

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: the docs one is going fine if I understand correctly

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> the one about encodings also had some progress

[22:20] <AlexDaniel> but I don't have any links…

[22:21] <MasterDuke> pretty sure they were linked in a weekly (maybe not both in the same one)

[22:22] <pmurias> good, I just got worried something bad happened to all of them :/

[22:22] *** aborazmeh left

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> no, I think it's fine

[22:22] <AlexDaniel> jmerelo: is there an overview of all our gsoc projects? https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-08-21#l728

[22:22] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[22:23] <jnthn> The encodings one was a success in so far as it's resulted in support for GB2312 being added, which I believe was its goal

[22:25] <MasterDuke> pmurias: complete change of topic, but i've forgotten how truffle support is going. i think a while ago you implemented something which should free up some new low-hanging fruit?

[23:00] <vrurg> SmokeMachine: Oh, how I missed it! ;) I need to think of another project for myself to play with many great stuff around.

[23:01] <SmokeMachine> vrurg: it's on a branch yet... a lot of tests to fix...

[23:02] <vrurg> SmokeMachine: My current queue of tasks is currently long enough to only dream of anything like that. :)

[23:05] <aearnus[m]> SmokeMachine: if you managed to integrate Red with Cro, that would totally be Perl 6's killer app

[23:06] <SmokeMachine> aearnus[m]: something like this? https://github.com/FCO/Cro-HTTP-Session-Red

[23:06] <SmokeMachine> :)

[23:06] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: Cro::HTTP::Session::Red  to start with.

[23:06] <vrurg> Ah, I'm late! 

[23:07] <rba> AlexDaniel: Is tellable6 got more IQ and acts on his own? Did he pass the turing test already?

[23:07] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: otherwise, what other level of intergation can you think of?

[23:08] <SmokeMachine> vrurg: that's a good question!

[23:10] <SmokeMachine> aearnus[m]: do you have a suggestion for that integration?

[23:14] <aearnus[m]> The session manager is nice

[23:14] * vrurg yawns... JVM backend builds...

[23:15] <aearnus[m]> I just miss my Ruby on rails `rake db:create_migration` workflow

[23:15] <SmokeMachine> aearnus[m]: https://github.com/FCO/Red/issues/15

[23:15] <vrurg> aearnus[m]: wanna try yourself in this area? 

[23:18] <aearnus[m]> Hmm, I'd like to. A lot of ORM stuff goes over my head though

[23:18] <SmokeMachine> aearnus[m]: could you comment on that thread to help me to find out how would work a good migration?

[23:36] <aearnus[m]> I don't think i'd have anything else on top of it. i'm looking forward to seeing how it works out :D

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> rba: yeah, pretty much

[23:39] *** [Coke] joined
[23:39] <SmokeMachine> aearnus[m]: have you seen that the CLI already started?

[23:40] <aearnus[m]> yeah, I looked at it since you sent the link

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> rba: at least you don't need to use .tell anymore, but .seen is still required I guess

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> rba: unless you talk to the bot directly

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> tellable6: rba

[23:41] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I saw rba 2019-08-21T23:07:33Z in #perl6: <rba> AlexDaniel: Is tellable6 got more IQ and acts on his own? Did he pass the turing test already?

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> tellable6: rba and you can also pass a message like this

[23:42] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to rba

[23:42] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: you don't need to use .tell? how do you use it?

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: just say “nickname: I hope to see you soon!” and that's it

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: I miss you!

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> OK it didn't work this time xD

[23:43] <AlexDaniel> I wonder why

[23:43] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: Are you using Red for that? :P

[23:44] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: just kidding...

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> ok now I won't be able to sleep until I figure this out :D

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: ah, actually, I know

[23:45] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: but is it saving every mentioned message?

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: Zoffix was away for so long that tellable6 no longer thinks that it's a valid nick

[23:46] *** wildtrees left
[23:46] <AlexDaniel> the cutoff is at 3 months currently

[23:46] <AlexDaniel> but it works for anybody else, like

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> woolfy: thank you for your work!

[23:47] <tellable6> AlexDaniel, I'll pass your message to woolfy1

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> also notice how it autocorrected the nickname :)

[23:48] <AlexDaniel> SmokeMachine: it doesn't save anything unless it say “I'll pass your message”. Also it saves the very last message of every user for seen functionality, but that's it

[23:48] <SmokeMachine> AlexDaniel: it saves to send every message for people that has not said anything for X time?

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> :D

[23:59] <aearnus[m]> is there an easy vector drawing library for perl6? i'm thinking something like Haskell's Gloss
