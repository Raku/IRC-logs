[11:55] <kawaii> So, this code is ugly and I hate it :)

[11:55] <kawaii> the column names in the database are _identical_ to the hash keys

[11:55] <kawaii> is there a prettier way of doing this? :P

[11:56] <moritz> my @attrs = <client client-data ...>;

[11:57] <moritz> $query.execute(|%client-data{@attrs})

[11:57] <kawaii> really? :O

[11:57] <moritz> and of course you can generate the ($1, $2, ...) list

[11:58] <kawaii> something like `($1..$16)` would do

[11:58] <moritz> join ', ', map { '$' . $_ } (1..@attrs.elems)

[15:49] <antoniogamiz> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JJ/pod-to-cached/builds/28048566

[15:50] <antoniogamiz> why this double "\\" appears?

[15:53] *** Guest93 left
[15:53] <antoniogamiz> for some reason it's escaping "/" 

[15:55] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, you are assuming that on windows paths are `foo/bar`, while on Windows they are `foo\bar`

[15:55] <timotimo> \\ inside "" is just a \

[15:56] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, you need to compare IO::Path objects instead of strings

[15:56] *** thundergnat joined
[15:56] <antoniogamiz> mmm so how can i make tests to work both on windows and unix?

[15:56] <thundergnat> Doc_Holliwood: rotor?

[15:56] <sena_kun> m: IO::Path.new('hehe\fufu') ~~ IO::Path.new('hehe\fufu')

[15:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar e81f6a018: ( no output )

[15:57] <thundergnat> m: my @a = ^20; say @a.rotor( 1 => $_-1 ) for 2,3,5;

[15:57] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, ^^

[15:57] <antoniogamiz> mmmm i wil try that!

[15:57] <antoniogamiz> IO::Path.new is the same than "aa".IO?

[15:58] *** thundergnat left

[16:05] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: mmm I have used .IO everywhere but it's still happening https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JJ/pod-to-cached/builds/28048949

[16:05] <Doc_Holliwood> so, rotor( 1 => 0 ) is a noop?

[16:05] <antoniogamiz> (this is where I'm working if you want to see the code https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12)

[16:05] <Doc_Holliwood> m: [10,20,30,40,50].rotor( 1 => 1 ).say

[16:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar e81f6a018: OUTPUT: «((10) (30) (50))␤»

[16:07] <Doc_Holliwood> ah, i see

[16:09] <antoniogamiz> it looks like that when i read the filenames, it only escapes the last "\"

[16:10] *** wildtrees left
[16:10] *** Guest93 joined
[16:11] *** rindolf3 left
[16:11] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, how do you get lines in cache?

[16:11] <sena_kun> it seems that it is confused because there are mixed `/` and `\` in path strings

[16:12] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, do you add e.g. a prefix somewhere or something like this?

[16:12] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12/files#diff-12050ba336b2774ee0b8264cb2d7a0f3R17 <- this looks super suspicious

[16:13] <antoniogamiz> that's the function that reads the filenames

[16:13] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: that's a failed try to fix it x'd

[16:13] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, I think you want your constants REP/DOC/IGNORE_FILE to be .IO, and when you are creating a new thing, do not do IO::Path.new(~), do DOC.child('file.name.foo');

[16:13] <antoniogamiz> you can see my several tries in my commits "Fix paths in windows... maybe,,,"

[16:14] <antoniogamiz> ooohhhhhh

[16:17] <antoniogamiz> let's see if that works :D

[16:18] <antoniogamiz> mmm still failing => https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12/commits/afffb7c98334a3ef27d83255ffdb5ff9ab74aad2

[16:20] <SmokeMachine> \o/

[16:21] <El_Che> Larry has given his tought about the rename: https://github.com/perl6/problem-solving/pull/89#pullrequestreview-300789072

[16:21] <SmokeMachine> is that oficial now?!

[16:24] *** MasterDuke joined
[16:24] <El_Che> SmokeMachine: no yet. But Larry's voice has a lot of weight, of course

[16:29] <antoniogamiz> the evaluable bot runs on windows?

[16:29] <timotimo> the *ables have prebuilt rakudos for linux, so it'd have to do compilation itself for that purpose

[16:30] <antoniogamiz> mmm

[16:30] <antoniogamiz> then i will have to download a virtual machine i suppose x'd

[16:31] <El_Che> antoniogamiz: there is rakudo star on windows

[16:32] <antoniogamiz> El_Che: I know but I do not use windows

[16:32] <El_Che> antoniogamiz: you can run containers in Windows, also an option

[16:32] <El_Che> ah, the other way around

[16:33] <antoniogamiz> I simply want to fix this: https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12

[16:33] <antoniogamiz> I cannot guess why that "\\" is appearing

[16:33] <antoniogamiz> I have added .IO as sena_kun told me, but it does not work :/

[16:33] <MasterDuke> m: say [10,20,30,40,50][0,2...*]

[16:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar e81f6a018: OUTPUT: «(10 30 50)␤»

[16:36] *** domidumont joined
[16:36] <antoniogamiz> If i run this in windows: DOC.IO.add('test1.pod6') (DOC is "a/b/c"

[16:36] <antoniogamiz> that should create a file called test1.pod6 inside c (which is inside b (which is inside a))

[16:36] <antoniogamiz> right?

[16:38] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, let me play with it...

[16:39] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, ah, the tests are running now

[16:39] <antoniogamiz> ?

[16:39] <antoniogamiz> mmm I think not

[16:39] <antoniogamiz> https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12

[16:40] <antoniogamiz> ah running yes sorry

[16:40] <antoniogamiz> they have failed again... what a surprise

[16:41] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, ok, I am forking...

[16:45] *** chloekek joined
[16:46] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, why do you removed .IO on path strings and .map(*.IO) calls?

[16:46] <sena_kun> ugh

[16:46] <sena_kun> *why did you remove

[16:46] <sena_kun> they are essential

[16:46] <Doc_Holliwood> ok, now this is seriously weird

[16:46] <antoniogamiz> because they were failing too

[16:47] <antoniogamiz> i will add them again

[16:47] <Doc_Holliwood> i have a grammar which sometimes works and sometimes doesnt, on the same input

[16:47] <Doc_Holliwood> as in i call the script 5 times and it works once. 

[16:47] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, well, not always you can make things work in a single set of changes, but you can drift away from something that is more broken to less broken

[16:48] *** domidumont left
[16:49] *** domidumont joined
[16:51] <antoniogamiz> i have readded the .IO, let's see :D

[16:52] <antoniogamiz> and yep, the "\\" still appears agh

[16:52] <sena_kun> let's see...

[16:54] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, https://github.com/perl6/Pod-To-Cached/pull/12/files#diff-61e5e9ae598a18166b4e9cc5c2f1329bR198 <- this is wrong

[16:55] <sena_kun> it assumes `/` is the separator, while `add` method should be used to be OS-independant

[16:56] <antoniogamiz>  ("$!path/"~INDEX).IO.spurt: to-json(%h); ???

[16:56] <antoniogamiz> in the rest of the code I do not see where I'm assuming that

[16:57] <sena_kun> hmm, did my link not highlighted that...

[16:57] <sena_kun> ah, it isn't, sorry

[16:57] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, yes, the line you pasted

[16:58] <antoniogamiz> mmm but that line should not affect those tests mm

[16:58] <antoniogamiz> I would be assuming "/" as delimiter here too, right? => constant DOC = 't/tmp/doc-ignore';???

[16:59] *** reach_satori_ left
[16:59] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, if you are making IO::Path object out of it, it is fine

[16:59] <antoniogamiz> mmm, then this should that line should be fine too because it uses .IO

[17:02] <sena_kun> antoniogamiz, well, imagine that $!path value is `foo\bar` and then you add `/baz` there, so it is `foo\bar/baz` now. then you call .IO on it and it is confused, it does not see it as `foo\bar\baz`

[17:03] <sena_kun> and even if the tests are not affected by it, this code won't work nicely on windows regardless of it

[17:03] <antoniogamiz> mmm ok, I haved chagned, thanks for the suggestion :,)

[17:04] <antoniogamiz> though it still fails............. i wanna cry

[17:05] <sena_kun> hmm, I wonder

[17:06] * sena_kun starts windows vm

[17:07] <antoniogamiz> :,)

[17:16] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: can you post the code and input somewhere?

[17:17] <Doc_Holliwood> nah, i trace it down. i was using .values where i should have used .list

[17:17] <antoniogamiz> sena_kun: thanks a lot for your time, if you find the problem pls tell me or comment in the PR pls :D

[17:18] <antoniogamiz> I will dream with "\" tonight haha

[17:18] <antoniogamiz> bye o/

[17:18] *** antoniogamiz left
[17:18] <sena_kun> o/

[17:33] <Doc_Holliwood> ok. this one drives me nuts. I made some progress with my grammar. see https://pastebin.com/Sp40qQrn

[17:34] <Doc_Holliwood> alas, this doesnt work. it does when i replace the "expanse" in the top rule with "list" or "range", but i cannot combine them

[18:15] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: probably not related, but a bunch of your tokens already exist (e.g., alpha, alphanum, etc)

[18:15] <Doc_Holliwood> no, these contain the underscore

[18:16] <Doc_Holliwood> whoever though that would be a good idea

[18:16] <MasterDuke> i.e., are built in to rakudo

[18:16] <MasterDuke> Doc_Holliwood: well, you could just subtract that from the pre-existing ones in your own

[18:17] <MasterDuke> it probably doesn't really matter, but people often run into trouble be accidentally creating rules/tokens with the same names as built-ins and that can cause problems

[18:19] <Doc_Holliwood> it makes no difference
