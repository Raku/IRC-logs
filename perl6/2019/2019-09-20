[08:08] <Cirno-ne-baka> Hello, i'm try to run Cro service but get this error

[08:08] <Cirno-ne-baka> ===SORRY!===Could not find Routes at line 3 in:¬† ¬† inst#/home/lil/.perl6¬† ¬† inst#/home/lil/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site¬† ¬† inst#/home/lil/rakudo/install/share/perl6/vendor¬† ¬† inst#/home/lil/rakudo/install/share/perl6¬† ¬† ap#¬† ¬† nqp#¬† ¬† perl5#

[08:09] <Cirno-ne-baka> What i need install to solve this problem? Git repo of this project https://github.com/mimosinnet/Cro-Personal-Web

[08:10] <jnthn> Probably missing -Ilib passed to Perl 6 so it finds your lib/Routes.pm6

[08:10] *** xinming_ left
[08:12] *** xelxebar left
[08:12] <timotimo> Cirno-ne-baka: want a version of perl6 that says "baka baka!" instead of "SORRY!"?

[08:14] <Cirno-ne-baka> timotimo: shiranai

[08:15] <timotimo> *shrug*

[08:18] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, likely -Ilib is missing

[08:18] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, or just `cro run .` from the service directory will do

[08:19] <Cirno-ne-baka> ` Ôã∂  cro run .bash: cro: command not found[lil@vivo] ~/Cro-Personal-Web/script (master) Ôã∂  zef install CroAll candidates are currently installedNo reason to proceed. Use --force-install to continue anyway`

[08:20] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, 1)how's your perl 6 installed? 2)are you sure the path where scripts are installed is in your PATH? after installation zef says something like `1 script [cro] is installed to ...`.

[08:21] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, answering your original question, you should be able to `perl6 -Ilib service.p6` in stubbed service directory if there is `Routes.pm6` present in `lib` directory.

[08:21] <Cirno-ne-baka> sena_kun: 1. Installed according this instruction https://rakudo.org/files/star/source

[08:22] <sena_kun> hmm, line `echo "export PATH=$(pwd)/install/bin/:$(pwd)/install/share/perl6/site/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc` sets the path

[08:23] <sena_kun> can you check if $rakudo-installation-dir/install/share/perl6/site/bin/cro exists?

[08:25] <Cirno-ne-baka> `echo $rakudo-installation-dir/install/share/perl6/site/bin/cro` `OUTPUT: -installation-dir/install/share/perl6/site/bin/cro`

[08:26] <sena_kun> oh, sorry, I mean the directory where you built rakudo star image, as I don't know it.

[08:26] <Cirno-ne-baka> this my path `export PATH=/home/lil/rakudo/install/bin/:/home/lil/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH                                                  42 export PATH=/home/lil/Cro-Personal-Web/script/install/bin/:/home/lil/Cro-Personal-Web/script/install/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH                      `

[08:27] <sena_kun> no file in /home/lil/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/bin/cro ?

[08:28] <Cirno-ne-baka> No such file or directory(((

[08:28] <sena_kun> hmm, well, obviously there is no file, if `cro is an unknown command`...

[08:28] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, any luck with plain running service.p6 in stub directory?

[08:29] <sena_kun> `perl6 -Ilib service.p6`

[08:30] <Cirno-ne-baka> sorry for my mistake

[08:30] <Cirno-ne-baka> im try `zef install Cro`

[08:30] <Cirno-ne-baka> but need `zef install cro` instead

[08:31] <sena_kun> Cro installs you Cro::Core, yes

[08:31] <sena_kun> zef searches for files inside of distributions if there are no matching names, and Cro::Core has Cro.pm6, which matches

[08:32] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, don't mind it, great if it'll work after installation now. :)

[08:35] *** xelxebar joined
[08:38] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, also, you can `zef --deps-only install .` in Cro project directory (or any other project, of course) and looking at META6.json file it'll install everythin necessary.

[08:39] <Cirno-ne-baka> sena_kun: thx!

[08:40] <sena_kun> Cirno-ne-baka, have fun.

[13:10] <AlexDaniel> so perl6.party and rakudo.party are probably the same thing

[17:02] <lizmat> not sure I like that, from a readability point of view  :-)

[17:06] <jaldhar> is using 'is copy' on a parameter known to be slow?  I have a recursive function that traverses a graph to find the longest path.  It is brutally slow.  (my naive algorithm probably doesn't help but still...)

[17:07] <jaldhar> If I take out the is copy the program is much faster but it gives the wrong answer.  I need to pass that parameter by value for this to work.
