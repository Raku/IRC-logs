[01:27] <Kaiepi> i encountered some bizarre issue where Channel.send doesn't seem to do anything, as in whenever block listening on the channel never runs after calling Channel.send

[01:28] <Kaiepi> wrapping Channel.send in Promise.in(1).then({ ... }) mitigates it fsr

[01:28] <Kaiepi> i'll see if i can golf something to replicate the issue tomorrow

[01:29] <Kaiepi> i also tried $*SCHEDULER.cue({ ... }, at => now + 1000) but that didn't work

[01:30] <Kaiepi> er

[01:30] <Kaiepi> $*SCHEDULER.cue({ ... }, at => now + 1)

[01:31] <Kaiepi> keep forgetting timeouts are seconds, not milliseconds like in node

[17:21] <discord6> <kawaii> That was me, using the nick unauthenticated üòÉ

[17:21] *** pistacchio joined
[17:22] <mst> if you join, and ask me in /msg while using the nick, I can arrange for it to be expired for you

[17:23] *** scimon left
[17:23] <AlexDaniel> mst: if it matters, they use the same handle on github (https://github.com/kawaii) and the account doesn't look new

[17:23] <mst> it's a nick grouped to an account that has shitloads of them and the account hasn't used it in more than long enough for it to be expired, I give zero fucks tbh

[17:24] <El_Che> And I thought that mst was a giver

[17:24] *** kawaii joined
[17:25] <discord6> <kawaii> mst: thanks, I've done so.

[17:26] <AlexDaniel> why shout from the other side? :)

[17:27] *** pistacchio left
[17:30] <mst> AlexDaniel: WHY ARE YOU NOT LOGGED IN

[17:30] *** AlexDaniel left
[17:30] *** AlexDaniel joined
[17:30] <AlexDaniel> mst: fixed

[17:30] <mst> egads, I go to all the trouble of giving you a hand made cloak and then you don't even wear it, you'll catch your death of cold

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> mst: I use it, but it gets lost on reconnects‚Ä¶

[17:31] <AlexDaniel> I should fix that

[17:31] <kawaii> success, I'm now in IRC proper :)

[17:31] *** kawaii left
[17:31] *** kawaii joined
[17:31] <mst> AlexDaniel: now you just need to volunteer him for some stuff and tell me to replace 'newbie' :D

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: can we not have a ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù thingie for our next release manager?

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> mst ‚Üë

[17:32] *** zacts left
[17:32] <mst> AlexDaniel: huh?

[17:32] <mst> he's going to be shipping things?

[17:32] <AlexDaniel> mst: yes

[17:33] <AlexDaniel> at least that's the plan right now :)

[17:33] <AlexDaniel> CLA was sent but not received yet

[17:33] *** kawaii left
[17:33] *** kawaii joined
[17:33] <mst> better?

[17:33] <AlexDaniel> yes

[17:33] <kawaii> yep, I'll be learning‚Ñ¢ things and helping out with rakudo/star releases eventually

[17:34] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: well, star has its own team now and things look fine

[17:35] <clarkema> lizmat: that was the world's quickest review!

[17:37] <kawaii> AlexDaniel: ah okay :) well, hopefully with some hand holding we can get a smooth release next time

[17:37] <kawaii> btw, do I need to be a member of the rakudo org on github too?

[17:38] <timotimo> there's no need for a CLA for rakudo/, right? only for perl6/?

[17:38] <AlexDaniel> timotimo: other way around

[17:39] <timotimo> oops

[17:39] <kawaii> wonder if my email got bounced, I do run my own mail server so it's not uncommon

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> kawaii: yes, but we'll need to wait for your CLA first

[17:42] <lizmat> clarkema: you're welcome

[17:42] <AlexDaniel> there's some activity from [Coke] on github but they're not here, hmm‚Ä¶

[20:27] <Skarsnik> hm Config::INI seems to be gone from the ecosystem but there is not PR/Commit going toward this :(

[20:29] <moritz> removed March 10th

[20:30] <Skarsnik> https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/commit/ec9bc74752bd65f397d6afce9ed072b6ce017d51 Look like a oopsie?

[20:31] <moritz> ask the author?

[20:32] <timotimo> yeah that doesn't look intentional
