[20:11] <johnjay> wher is a good summary of changes from perl5 to perl6?

[20:11] <johnjay> *where

[20:11] <Grinnz> johnjay: remove the entire language and implement a whole new one

[20:12] <johnjay> ok

[20:18] *** mowcat left
[20:20] <johnjay> >The possibilities and shorthands are many in perl6.

[20:21] <Grinnz> the language has been renamed to Raku, and the channel is now #raku

[20:21] <Grinnz> you'll get more help there

[20:22] <Grinnz> it's not a new version of Perl, as Perl 5.30.1 was just released a week ago

[20:24] <johnjay> gotcha

[20:26] <Grinnz> AlexDaniel: maybe time to shut this channel? options as i see it are add a +f to #raku, or see if perigrin can set up his bot here (I can ask if you want) - either way +m and emptying the topic are probably a good idea

[20:26] <Grinnz> (not sure if you are "channel owner" :)

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: yeah, something needs to be done, I'm just unable to think about it now because I have to think about something else

[20:27] <AlexDaniel> having a bot here is a great idea though

[20:27] <Grinnz> no worries, we're all busy :)

[20:29] <AlexDaniel> Grinnz: #perl6-dev is down to just 21 users

[20:40] *** mowcat left
[20:42] *** mowcat joined
[20:43] <japhb> Grinnz: I dunno about completely emptying the topic.  But maybe changing it to " »ö« #raku and #raku-dev are OPEN FOR BUSINESS, please go there instead | OLD irclogs: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6"

[20:43] <Grinnz> yeah, i meant emptying it of the "current use" stuff

[20:44] <Grinnz> it should definitely refer to #raku/#raku-dev

[21:01] <AlexDaniel> japhb, Grinnz: better?

[21:02] <Grinnz> +1

[21:05] *** breinbaas left
[21:06] <Grinnz> perigrin is going to try to set up his bot. this room may become noisy, so probably a good time to leave :P
