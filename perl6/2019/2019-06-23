[10:38] <xinming_> In perl6, sometimes, We may encounter   Use of uninitialized value of type Any in numeric context  in block at   (... file-to-pm6)  line xxx

[10:38] <xinming_> But when I go to the line xxx, I saw it's a if block

[10:38] <xinming_> In this case, How can we know the concrete position of where the uninitialized value is used?

[10:49] *** sjm_uk left
[10:57] <sena_kun> are you asking about how to debug such cases or is there a way for Perl 6 to exactly say the line and column where the value is?

[10:57] <tobs> xinming_: maybe the numeric context is in the if condition? E.g. when you do `if $x == 0` and $x is uninitialised, then you'll get this warning and the line number will be correct.

[11:51] <xinming_> The way I debug this is, I comment half of the code, and try them one by one. But still a bit curious why sometimes, It doesn't report the right line of code.

[11:52] <sena_kun> I am not sure you need to comment out much, just printing all vars that are used as operands should be enough, if some is Any, it's the thing

[11:52] *** netrino__ joined
[11:53] <sena_kun> as for the right line - I guess we can start from providing a small gist where the position is blatantly wrong, and then create a rakudo ticket something like "The error message should be better".

[16:12] *** louisono joined
[16:13] <louisono> hello

[16:13] <antoniogamiz> o/

[16:14] <louisono> i'm starting to learn/ play with Perl6. is there somebody to answer a few questions? 

[16:14] <antoniogamiz> I can try :D

[16:14] <louisono> thank you in advance :)

[16:15] <louisono> i don't quite understand how the language works, is it interpreted or compiled or something else?

[16:16] <antoniogamiz> it's compiled to an intermediate bytecode

[16:16] *** rindolf left
[16:16] <sena_kun> it compiled into bytecode for a VM called moarvm. moarvm supports JIT too.

[16:16] <antoniogamiz> that it's used by a virtual machine

[16:17] <louisono> ok so when i write a bit of perl6 code and type 'perl6 myfile.p6' do i get a bytecode file of some sort?

[16:18] <xinming> louisono: It just run the myfile.p6

[16:18] <xinming> louisono: internally, It's compiled into MoarVM bytecode.

[16:19] <xinming> for now, Only modules will be compiled cached and compiled to bytecode

[16:20] <xinming> And I do actually wish that we can distribute the bytecode of perl6 program.

[16:20] <louisono> that feature is not yet available?

[16:21] <Voldenet> it is available, but it is not supported

[16:22] *** rindolf joined
[16:22] *** sjm_uk joined
[16:22] <Voldenet> I've seen people saying that they did this, but it's not documented and it might even get thrown out

[16:23] * sena_kun doesn't think it is a common usecase

[16:23] <louisono> ok, and i think i've seen somewhere that it's possible to compile perl6 code into jvm bytecode.

[16:24] <sena_kun> it is, though your mileage may vary, as moarvm is more actively developed compared to jvm backend

[16:25] <sena_kun> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo#configuring-rakudo-to-run-on-the-jvm

[16:25] <Voldenet> overall, in perl/python/js/ruby/php land you just don't usually precompile your code

[16:29] <louisono> ok thank you very much for the answer I was curious about this 

[16:30] <louisono> if i get it right perl6 code get compiled into bytecode by rakudo and that bytecode is then run by moarVM?

[16:31] <sena_kun> technically, there is an intermediate thing called "nqp", but from the user point of view, it doesn't matter too much unless you are interested in the structure itself

[16:33] *** holyghost joined
[16:33] <louisono> sena_kun: i actually was wondering about nqp since it is mentionned in the page you linked 

[16:34] <holyghost> I will leave this message for who reads it with .seen, I have fielded an example in Game::Bayes, to let it rest there

[16:34] *** sjm_uk left
[16:34] <holyghost> I'm on vacation for 2 months, I might join here on the channel but I may be afk most of the time. Our university is closed until september

[16:35] *** holyghost left
[16:36] <sena_kun> louisono, once again, are you interested in developing compiler / compiler parts, or playing with Perl 6 itself?

[16:36] *** sjm_uk joined
[16:37] *** pmurias joined
[16:37] *** sjm_uk left
[16:37] <louisono> nah i'm just playing, haha :D

[16:38] <sena_kun> louisono, I'd bet on just installing a rakudo installation with moarvm and writing something more or less simple to get taste of the language.

[16:39] <sena_kun> louisono, what os/linux distribution do you use?

[16:40] <louisono> I'm on ubuntu 16

[16:41] <sena_kun> louisono, https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg#debian-and-ubuntu <- those three commands should done the thing. :)

[16:41] <sena_kun> though I wonder if 16 is not too old...

[16:43] <sena_kun> xenial should be supported

[16:44] <louisono> thank you i will try that

[16:44] <sena_kun> louisono, after that you'd need to get a newer zef (it is current Perl 6 package manager) installation

[16:45] <louisono> can i get it with apt-get?

[16:45] <sena_kun> louisono, https://gist.github.com/Altai-man/0f7dbe6335bdb4ab1c8e4725c1f180dc <- these should be around right

[16:46] <sena_kun> or, hmm, stop...

[16:46] <sena_kun> I wonder if the issue I saw is fixed already

[16:47] <sena_kun> louisono, well, never mind my previous gist, please, though "/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/add-perl6-to-path" and "/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef-as-user" are helpful commands to do after installing rakudo-pkg, from my experience

[16:58] <louisono> ok thank you again!

[17:00] <louisono> what is the difference between installing this way and following the steps described on the rakudo website? https://rakudo.org/files/star/source

[17:00] <sena_kun> you are welcome, as for the difference...

[17:01] <sena_kun> rakudo-pkg is a precompiled package, so it just installs and works. the page on the rakudo website describes compiling everything from sources.

[17:02] <sena_kun> what's more, it describes a way to compile "rakudo star", a thing that includes rakudo, zef and a bunch of pre-installed modules, so you are installing it avoiding apt-get help, while rakudo-pkg package contains rakudo and zef(with moarvm+nqp, of course)

[17:04] <sena_kun> and rakudo-pkg uses apt, so you can always apt-update or apt-remove, which is a bit nicer, I guess

[17:05] <louisono> ok and when I have installed rakudo with rakudo-pkg I can still get the modules that are included in rakudo star by just using zef I guess

[17:06] <sena_kun> exactly. :)

[17:06] <louisono> ok thank you very much for taking time to explain all this

[18:01] <Voldenet> that may be a foolish question, but my 2k lines "scripts" are getting a bit unwieldy - how do I split my code into multiple files? :D

[18:03] <Voldenet> in perl5 it was easy, just move some code into .pm file, export some routines

[18:03] <Voldenet> in perl6 it doesn't actually seem to work like that

[18:03] <moritz> why not?

[18:04] <Voldenet> "Could not find Something at line 1"

[18:05] *** MilkmanDan joined
[18:05] <moritz> oh, . is not in the search path by default

[18:05] <moritz> put the module into lib, and run it with perl6 -Ilib yourscript.p6

[18:07] *** antoniog1miz left

[19:16] <Xliff> ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDfwxj6uM9krC+L7Ip2nuAAn0dF+UYhtqoKQ3nuo8JyOn2bdUqlEwS7MzzCsZFJk34F7P4LWdPWJr+L5fiudXIn9PojFVv2US8ky+TnxCG5tckxSeEUlDlCUkfs+51UaM32fW0Wf1Zc2jFzT+Bul/IQXgn8RpXIoHN7aNSlW0TfKXypWcAj2HiCv3yD3I4/ANVmzWg1mtvUrDeYwm0Qv41JHBzywHinu95T9Emh72ANm8XTDx2OJ28AU5TZdmXrrl3j017UqjHMnid8z+DZTHg60Eu4+ORtoaYKD4eKZUSY1XpLlkZpyPnsBpO9GMuV9vTLOjUe0TjMYLL6KExX1CHz cbwood@INSANITY-4

[19:16] <Xliff> Oops.

[19:16] <Xliff> Well... theres's my public key if anyone wants it. :P

[19:16] <Xliff> This is Rakudo version 2019.03.1 built on MoarVM version 2019.03

[19:16] <Xliff> implementing Perl 6.d.

[19:16] <Xliff> ^^ Missing commit hashes. Gone now?

[20:10] <nadim_> what's this warning? /home/nadim/nadim/devel/repositories/rakudo/install/bin/nqp-m version 2019.03-240-g8c90f6266 is outdated, 2019.03-253-g5190ce935 expected.

[20:10] *** empee0 joined
[20:11] <nadim_> will a newer one be downloaded or does one have to do something amnually

[20:11] <nadim_> then  I get this ATTENTION: Found /home/nadim/nadim/devel/repositories/rakudo/install/bin/moar version 2019.05-53-gcce71cdbf, which is too old. Wanted at least 2019.05-91-g81e5cbf2a

[20:12] <lizmat> nadim_: are you on HEAD?

[20:12] <nadim_> yes

[20:12] <lizmat> hmmm....  perhaps a "git submodule update" will work

[20:12] <nadim_> just pulled and wanted to build the latest when I got those

[20:12] <lizmat> or else a reclone

[20:13] <nadim_> ok, I'll try

[20:13] <lizmat> we've had some issues in the build process...  it should be ok now

[20:13] <lizmat> but if you tried it somewhere during the time it was not optimal

[20:13] <lizmat> it could be that there's stuff around that prevent it from working correctly

[20:13] <lizmat> afk again&

[20:13] <nadim_> git submodule update didn't remove the warning

[21:24] <xinming> Sorry to repeat the question, Any one here knows wether there is a way to bind the multiple value "container" for the hash?

[21:27] <xinming> m: my %t; my $x := %t<x>; $x = 5; my ($a, $b) := (%t<a>, %t<b>); $a = 4; %t.perl.say;

[21:27] <xinming> This does't work either.

[23:21] <jaldhar> Hello.  When doing the Perl Weekly Challenge, I caused a bug in my code where I was trying to express "$year is not a multiple of 100" but I wrote !$year % 100 instead of  !($year % 100)  I caught it but it got me thinking.  For symmetrys sake, shouldn't there be "is not a multiple of" operator?

[23:22] <jaldhar> It could be !% or perhaps !%.  Is this a bad idea?  If it is worth pursuing, who should I talk to about proposing it as an addition to the Perl6 language.  It would be a fun way for me to contribute I think.

[23:23] <jaldhar> (And yes I know I can define my own operators.  This is about making it an official feature of Perl6.)

[23:24] <jaldhar> err and above that should be "!% or perhaps !%".

[23:24] <jaldhar> dammit !% 

[23:24] *** pecastro left
[23:25] <jaldhar> huh you can do "! % %" for some reason. 

[23:25] <jaldhar> *sigh* can't

[23:41] <vrurg> m: say 123 %% 100

[23:41] <vrurg> jaldhar: is that what you're looking for?
