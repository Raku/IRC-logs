[01:26] <Elronnd> how come https://docs.perl6.org/type/IO::Notification only has notifications for file change and rename, not create or delete?

[01:26] *** netrino left
[01:30] <ugexe> because moarvm is built using libuv, and that is a libuv limitation -- http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/fs_event.html

[01:33] <ugexe> if you know of a cross-platform way to handle other events i'm sure libuv would love a PR implementing them

[01:37] *** syb joined
[01:37] <Xliff> ugexe: libuv wraps inotify which has WAY more ops than that.

[01:38] <Elronnd> but doesn't it also support other things?

[01:38] <Elronnd> kqueue and whatever mac and win32 have

[01:39] <Xliff> I think the limitation is more due to the fact that it has to support the union of inotify(Linux), FSEvents(Darwin), kqueue(BSD), ReadDirectoryChangesW(Windows), and event ports(Solaris)

[01:40] <Xliff> They got the basics in, but that would be a messy C file with all the #ifdef(s) it would have to support to offer more.

[01:41] <Xliff> ugexe: But you're right. That is a PR worth writing.

[01:41] <Elronnd> is the PR 'check if we're on a platform that has this stuff, and if so make it a separate event'?

[01:42] <Elronnd> cause I would totally do that

[01:43] *** syb left
[01:43] *** matiasli1a left
[01:48] <Xliff> Elrond: You read my mind.

[01:49] <Elronnd> ok this is kind of annoying

[01:49] <Elronnd> I'm getting like 8 different events for one file change

[01:49] <Elronnd> probably vim's fault but

[01:50] <Xliff> Add some event smothing code for that?

[01:51] <Elronnd> was thinking of manually checking the file hash, but that works too

[01:58] <Xliff> Huh! Looks like they do watch for all the events in libuv!

[01:58] <Xliff> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/linux-inotify.c#L293

[01:59] <Xliff> But cut them down to the CHANGE/RENAME, here:

[01:59] <Xliff> https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/linux-inotify.c#L224

[02:00] <Xliff> And that gets passed to the callback not long after: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/linux-inotify.c#L260

[02:01] <Xliff> So it's not that libuv can't do it. It's just that its the callback that gets a limited sample of the events.

[02:28] <ugexe> these are also relevant regarding file system events

[02:30] <Xliff> YUeah. For OSX

[02:31] <Xliff> s/U//

[02:31] <ugexe> #1730 shows a difference between linux/windows/osx and FreeBSD/AIX/smartOS/zos

[02:36] <Xliff> True. That is referenced by 1649 which looks to be a pull request for OSX.

[02:37] <Xliff> Nevertheless, this is good info to have, if indeed an attempt is made to change libuv.

[02:41] * Seance[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/GtqaZPlVdomCXBFoyYtGaqFt >

[02:42] <Seance[m]> I don't understand postcircumfix in this example, and I didn't gain an effective understanding from the associated docs

[02:42] <Seance[m]> This calls the .sub method stored in the scalar on teh @input array

[02:42] *** snarkyboojum left
[02:43] <Seance[m]> I assume it implies a map type behavior?

[02:44] *** Manifest0 left
[02:44] <ugexe> Elronnd: there are a couple things (although they are escaping me atm) that are implemented on only a single platform, so its possible they might accept such a PR

[02:45] <tobs> Seance[m]: yes ». is the hyper method call operator. It is pretty much map but may be parallelised

[02:47] <tobs> Seance[m]: did you not find the documentation about it or was it unclear? We're currently having a documentation squashathon, so if you have any problem/suggestion consider opening an issue at https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues

[02:48] <Seance[m]> Turns out I was looking at the wrong docs, I was looking up that unicode operator and found postcircumfix, which is distinct from hyper method calls, so it's user error

[02:48] <Seance[m]> I'll read up on the hyper method call operator tobs , thank you

[02:49] <tobs> no problemo

[03:02] <lumin> Hello guys, what should I do if zef fails to update the p6c mirror? (I guess there is some problem on the server side)

[03:02] *** Manifest0 left
[03:05] <ugexe> lumin: the latest version of zef should not have that issue. `git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git && cd zef && perl6 -I. bin/zef uninstall zef && perl6 -I. bin/zef install .`

[03:06] <ugexe> it changed the mirror

[03:06] <lumin> Ah, ok. I'm just using the one in Debian sid

[03:07] <ugexe> there is a hacky way as well

[03:08] *** zacts left
[03:08] <ugexe> do `zef --help`. towards the bottom it will show the configuration file location. you can edit this file so that the first mirror for p6c matches this: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/e73897378b36cbf53f2ed8d98363d94bac70767d/resources/config.json#L60

[03:08] *** Manifest0 joined
[03:10] <ugexe> if you dont want to edit that file then make a copy of it, put it in ~/.config/zef/config.json, and edit *that* copy

[03:12] *** Manifest0 left
[03:13] <lumin> ugexe: Thanks, after editing that json file for both the cpan and c6p mirror URLs, zef started to work

[03:14] <lumin> so Debian needs an update for its zef package

[03:17] <lumin> ugexe: How likely will zef change it's mirror URL again in the next one or two years? I'm going to update the zef package for Debian Buster

[03:19] *** Manifest0 joined
[03:20] <ugexe> i don't plan on changing it. someone whined about it not being hosted by p6c once before so i changed it back, but i guess thats what i get for being a push over

[03:22] <lumin> got it

[03:24] <Xliff> What is the current status of p6c?

[09:46] <hankache> .seen timotimo

[09:46] <yoleaux> I saw timotimo 08:59Z in #perl6: <timotimo> yay, a masak blog!

[09:46] <timotimo> yo

[09:46] <hankache> Hola timo

[09:46] <timotimo> gruetzli

[09:47] <hankache> you're still hosting rakudo.org right?

[09:47] <timotimo> well, more or less

[09:48] <timotimo> it's not actually my server, but i did set some things up there, and i do have root access

[09:48] <timotimo> so for all intents and purposes yeah, i am hosting rakudo.org i guess :)

[09:48] *** Manifest0 joined
[09:49] <hankache> And I guess that will stay the case until we have figured out a proper infrastructure?

[09:49] <timotimo> probably, yes

[09:49] <hankache> cool

[09:49] <timotimo> i'm regrettably tied up with other stuff i have to finally do :S

[09:50] <hankache> timotimo++

[09:50] <timotimo> else i'd probably be writing dockerfiles and such so that setting up rakudo.org becomes a one-command affair

[09:50] <jmerelo> timotimo: should do the same for perl6 docs. As a matter of fact, I've created an issue to do that...

[09:51] <timotimo> it doesn't matter who does it :)

[09:52] <hankache> so I figured out since it might take a while for the people working on the infrastructure to get it done, we might as get something working meanwhile

[09:52] <hankache> everything seems ok except the download part

[09:53] <hankache> Basically those links are dead: https://rakudo.org/files/star https://rakudo.org/latest/star/win64 https://rakudo.org/latest/star/win32 https://rakudo.org/latest/star/macos https://rakudo.org/latest/star/source

[09:54] <hankache> I've registered rakudostar.com to act as a temporary replacement and host the files

[09:55] <hankache> so now instead of going to https://rakudo.org/latest/star/source you would go to https://rakudostar.com/latest/star/source

[09:56] <hankache> so for those 5 urls I need to redirect them to the new ones s/rakudo.org/rakudostar.com

[09:57] <hankache> do you have any idea how can this be achieved?

[09:57] <hankache> is this something that you could do?

[10:01] <hankache> timotimo?

[10:01] <timotimo> it's possible, rakudo.org is a perl5 mojo-something web app

[10:02] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/rakudo.org

[10:02] <hankache> ok will have a look

[10:02] <hankache> thanks timo

[10:02] <jmerelo> hankache timotimo I do have access to the server too, if you need some help just let me know.

[10:03] <timotimo> we can also put all the files onto the actual rakudo.org server

[10:03] <hankache> will it update automatically once I push to git or would you have to do something?

[10:03] <hankache> hello jj

[10:03] <jmerelo> hi

[10:03] <jmerelo> probably will have to do something. At least docs.perl6.org is updated by hand

[10:04] <timotimo> i'll have to ./update-rakudo.org.sh i guess

[10:04] <timotimo> though i have some local changes i think?

[10:04] <timotimo> but i just put some text into templates; not_found.production.html.ep, files.html.ep, exception.production.html.ep

[10:04] <jmerelo> timotimo: can you merge them back?

[10:05] <timotimo> https://gist.github.com/timo/d70355064ef0159f23e15abef6653efe

[10:05] <jmerelo> timotimo: if you're wary of uploading your private key, maybe create a new Github user specifically for that and use it to upload the changes?

[10:06] <timotimo> if we do our job right, these changes will have to be reverted anyway

[10:07] <hankache> indeed

[10:08] <jmerelo> timotimo: create a branch and deploy that branch

[10:09] <jmerelo> You probably know that temporary changes tend to become permanent, and what's intended as permanent eventually ends up being temporary.

[10:09] <timotimo> i'd really just "git reset --hard" immediately :)

[10:09] <jmerelo> So I wouldn't put such a fine distinction between make-it-work hacks and release-ready features.

[10:11] <hankache> of so since the hosted version is not the same as the one on GitHub shall we do the changes directly?

[10:11] <timotimo> no

[10:12] <timotimo> that'd be Very Bad™ :)

[10:12] <hankache> hehehe

[10:12] <timotimo> it's basically what i have done

[10:12] <timotimo> that should tell you enough about how bad it really is

[10:13] <hankache> so how do I land my changes then?

[10:14] <timotimo> i can just "git pull" them

[10:14] <timotimo> or we give you access to the server as well, that's probably not a bad idea

[10:14] <hankache> ok I'll push to GitHub and let you know

[10:14] <timotimo> of course jmerelo can also do it

[10:14] <timotimo> i'm hoping to get into a deep concentration with the issue i'm working on %)

[10:15] <hankache> thanks

[10:15] <jmerelo> hankache: I'm going to stick around for a while, so just let me know if you need me to do something.

[10:16] <jmerelo> If I'm out, put a j in front of my nick here and use Telegram.

[14:27] <dmaestro> Ran into this edge case where Num -> FatRat conversion hangs completely ^

[14:28] <jaldhar> Hello.  How do I do exponentiation on FatRats?  The docs imply ** converts the answer to a Num.

[14:28] <timotimo> yeah, you'll have to work around that at the moment

[14:28] <jaldhar> dmaestro: I seem to be getting odd answers too.

[14:28] <timotimo> exponentiation on a rational number is just exponentiating the numerator and the denominator separately, right?

[14:30] <jaldhar> hmm

[14:31] <dmaestro> m: (FatRat.new(1,1000) ** 20).nude

[14:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 86d66ea1d: ( no output )

[14:32] <dmaestro> For a FatRat, exponentiation just works. For a Rat, it's a different story

[14:32] <camelia> rakudo-moar 86d66ea1d: OUTPUT: «1e-60␤»

[14:33] <timotimo> well, you can just upgrade a rat to a fatrat before exponentiation

[14:33] <dmaestro> Yes.

[14:33] <dmaestro> 10**50 is an Int, not a Num, I believe, so it's also high precision

[14:34] <dmaestro> As opposed to 1e50

[14:37] <timotimo> yeah, that's literally syntax for Nums

[14:37] <dmaestro> My case is trying to convert a Num to a FatRat with a ridiculously small epsilon - trying to avoid a type check for Num when It can be given either a FatRat or a Num

[14:40] <dmaestro> er, maybe not, just trying to get as much precision from a Num as it has ... maybe reaching too far ...

[14:40] <dmaestro> Disruptive that it can hang in this computation.

[14:42] <timotimo> you can split the num apart into its IEEE defined parts

[14:42] <dmaestro> Ah, didn't think of that :-)

[14:43] <timotimo> you can use .write-num64 for that purpose

[14:44] <timotimo> m: my buf8 $foo .= new; $foo.write-num64(2.2756215391563402e-06, 0); say $foo

[14:45] <dmaestro> Been pushing the limits of Num's - range of about 1e-323 to 1e308 :-)

[14:47] <timotimo> we're lacking a few arithmetic things on FatRat, like square root or the trigonometric functions ... interested? :P

[14:48] <dmaestro> I've actually got a pretty good routine for sqrt and arbitrary-precision Pi. Plan to release Math::Precise for some of those things, maybe this coming week.

[15:01] <jaldhar> timotimo: how do I use .write-int64 with a Num?  The docs are a bit unclear to me it seems.

[15:02] <timotimo> you'd have to turn it into an integer first

[15:02] <jaldhar> timotimo: or maybe that's not what I want.

[15:03] <timotimo> if you want the bit pattern of the num according to the IEEE, you'd use write-num64

[15:03] <Geth> ¦ doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/2765

[15:03] <jaldhar> Here's what I'm trying to do:

[15:03] <jaldhar> constant RAMANUJAN = 𝑒 ** (π * sqrt(163)); RAMANUJAN.say;

[15:03] <evalable6> jaldhar, rakudo-moar 86d66ea1d: OUTPUT: «2.625374126407677e+17␤»

[15:03] *** Manifest0 joined
[15:04] <jaldhar> with the output as a rational number but I just can't figure it out.

[15:04] <jaldhar> (That's Perl Weekly Challenge #2 btw)

[15:04] <timotimo> exponentiation with an irrational number is not going to give you a rat, that's a limitation of rakudo

[15:05] <timotimo> i don't quite get what write-int64 would be used for in this context

[15:05] <jaldhar> timotimo: for ever or just as it is currently implemented? (I'm on 2018.12d)

[15:06] <timotimo> i'm not sure if it will become part of the language

[15:06] *** skids joined
[15:07] <jaldhar> timotimo: yeah forget .write-int64.

[15:07] <timotimo> but if you can wait, dmaestro seems to be working on that

[15:07] <timotimo> at least in module space

[15:08] <jaldhar> If only I could get the result as a FatRat I'd know what to do but it looks like I have to figure out another way.

[15:08] <timotimo> you can turn the Num into a FatRat

[15:08] <timotimo> of course it won't have more precision than the 64bit float had

[15:09] <jaldhar> timotimo: the problem is I need 32 digits of precision

[15:10] <timotimo> decimal digits?

[15:10] <jaldhar> timotimo: I guess.  The question just says 32 digits.

[15:10] <timotimo> ha

[15:11] <camelia> rakudo-moar 86d66ea1d: OUTPUT: «34␤»

[15:11] <timotimo> get it to this many decimal places and you'll have 32 binary digits of precision :) :)

[15:13] <jaldhar> timotimo: but somehow I don't think that was intended by the author.

[15:13] <timotimo> most probably not

[15:13] <timotimo> but you can teach the author a lesson :) :) :)

[15:13] <jaldhar> that's true!

[15:13] <timotimo> very tongue-in-cheek right here

[15:14] <timotimo> if you want to reach 32 digits of precision, you'll have to break down the task into pieces that you can use either integer math with, or FatRat math

[15:14] <timotimo> m: say sqrt(163)

[15:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 86d66ea1d: OUTPUT: «12.767145334803704␤»

[15:14] <timotimo> m: say sqrt(163).nude

[15:14] <timotimo> OK

[15:14] <timotimo> so first you'd probably want an implementation of square root that approximates the result until it's precise enough for the rest of the calculation

[15:15] <jaldhar> ok

[15:15] <timotimo> you'll probably want to figure out how precision is affected by exponentiation

[15:15] <timotimo> i might be on the totally wrong track fwiw

[19:34] <xinming> for @x -> $item { };     <--- In this example, How do we get the remaining items after the $item?

[19:34] <xinming> for example, after we processed 2 $items, then, in block, we call last, But before we call last, I'd like to get the "tail" of unprocessed items.

[19:35] <xinming> I know I can have index to do that. Just know wether there is better way. :-)

[19:35] <lizmat> while @x.shift -> $item { }

[19:36] <timotimo> is it okay to ... yeah

[19:36] <lizmat> @x will contain unprocessed items after the loop

[19:36] <timotimo> only if @x is allowed to be changed, of course

[19:36] <lizmat> well, if not, then first copy it....  or start playing tricks with iterators, I guess

[19:38] <timotimo> sure

[19:38] <timotimo> can always have a variable that counts up with iterations

[19:38] <lizmat> for @x.kv -> $i, $item { }

[19:39] <timotimo> well, you'd want the $i after the end of thel oop

[19:39] <xinming> thanks, that way is easy.

[19:39] <xinming> the while @x.shift -> $item  { }

[19:40] <xinming> I had my version with   @x.kv -> $idx, $item { }      I personally prefer the 'while ...' sollution

[19:40] <lizmat> xinming: please note that that only works that way if the value shifted before the end booleanizes to True

[19:41] <xinming> hmm, So, seems the fo r @x.kv -> $i, $item   is I want.

[19:41] <lizmat> if not, then probably the .kv -> $index, $value is probably the better solution

[19:41] <xinming> As I meet what you mentioned yesterday.

[19:41] <xinming> something like;

[19:41] <xinming> m: my $x = start { sleep 5 }; if $x { "We won't say".say; };

[22:49] <sena_kun> this is what I'd call "very surprising"

[22:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[a => {a => 3, b => 2} b => {c => 1}]␤»

[22:50] <timotimo> you think? [blorp] always iterates what's inside it to put it into the array, "single-argument rule"

[22:50] <timotimo> so if you want to prevent that, put a , before the ]

[22:51] <timotimo> m: say {a => 3, b => 2}.Array.perl

[22:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[:b(2), :a(3)]␤»

[22:51] <timotimo> m: say {a => 3, b => 2}.item.Array.perl

[22:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[:b(2), :a(3)]␤»

[22:51] <timotimo> m: say ({a => 3, b => 2},).Array.perl

[22:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[{:a(3), :b(2)},]␤»

[22:51] <timotimo> not sure if there's a way with a simple method call

[22:51] <sena_kun> timotimo, yup. well, maybe because I was too lazy to check this "single-arg rule" everyone talks about...

[22:52] <sena_kun> it totally looks to me like a "a hash literal inside of an array literal", hence an array of hashes. apparently, I am wrong here...

[22:52] <timotimo> well, the same thing happens with "an array literal inside an array literal"

[22:52] <timotimo> m: say [[1, 2]].perl

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[1, 2]␤»

[22:52] <timotimo> m: say [[1, 2],].perl

[22:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[[1, 2],]␤»

[22:53] <timotimo> one of the things it allows is to use <foo bar baz> but get an Array out of it:

[22:53] <timotimo> m: say [<a b c d e>].perl

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]␤»

[22:53] <timotimo> m: say [<a b c d e>,].perl

[22:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"),]␤»

[22:53] <sena_kun> timotimo, are there some particular advantages with this approach?

[22:54] <timotimo> i don't remember all the discussions from back when this design was built

[22:54] <sena_kun> ok, never mind then

[22:54] <timotimo> it was part of the Great List Refactor which made things flatten a whole lot less on their own, and also removed Parcel from the language

[22:54] <sena_kun> just a bit curious what can drive such a thing

[22:59] <raschipi> The principle behind it is called DWIM. Do What I Mean.

[22:59] <raschipi> And we always said that for every DWIM there's often a WAT.

[23:02] <sena_kun> the perspectives are different, so in this case I'd totally say that DWIM is "I want a hash in an array". but, of course, cannot counter a WAT moment part. :)

[23:02] <timotimo> see also the waterbed theory of language design maybe?

[23:03] <sena_kun> yup, heard about this one

[23:03] <Xliff> can CStructs do delegation?

[23:03] *** pecastro_ left
[23:03] <sena_kun> well, didn't want to blame anything or something like that. just maybe too tired from writing Controls code this late...

[23:03] <raschipi> m: my @a = <1 2 3>; .say for @a; #This should print '1␤2␤3' or '1 2 3'?

[23:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>␤Two terms in a row across lines (missing semicolon or comma?)␤at <tmp>:3␤------> 0327⏏5<EOL>␤    expecting any of:␤        infix␤        infix stopper␤        statement end␤        s…»

[23:04] <timotimo> Xliff: delegation is possible, but only to things that can be an attribute inside a CStruct, i.e. you can only delegate to a CStruct inside (with has or HAS) the CStruct

[23:04] <raschipi> m: my @a = <1 2 3>; .say for @a;

[23:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «1␤2␤3␤»

[23:04] <timotimo> in particular, you can't use a regular perl6 type like Array or Hash for delegation

[23:04] <raschipi> This should print '1␤2␤3' or '1 2 3'?

[23:06] <Xliff> timotimo: EXCELLENT!

[23:11] <timotimo> delegation is mostly about autogenerated methods, and method stuff can go into CStruct just fine, because everything related to methods lives in the metaobject rather than the instances themselves

[23:12] <raschipi> m: my @a = <1 2 3>; my @b = <a b c>; .say for @a, @b;

[23:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar b0dd44b00: OUTPUT: «[1 2 3]␤[a b c]␤»

[23:12] <raschipi> sena_kun: can you see that it always unwraps one level?

[23:20] <Xliff> timotimo: Doesn't work. I get the inscrutable "P6opaque: no such attribute '$!inlined' on type Attribute+{<anon|2>} in a Attribute+{<anon|2>} when trying to bind a value"

[23:21] <Xliff> Goes away if I remove the handles trait from the HAS declaration.
