[02:03] <choiboi> timotimo: That's so cool!

[02:04] <timotimo> weechat also has a "relay protocol" with dedicated clients that can connect directly to it, like Glowing Bear

[02:04] <hahainternet> timotimo: honestly i love tmux, but i've not joined the weechat crew yet

[02:04] <hahainternet> still on ancient irssi

[02:04] <hahainternet> one true irc client :)

[02:04] <choiboi> hahainternet: stick with irssi ;)

[02:04] <timotimo> eh. i won't judge

[02:04] <hahainternet> tiling WM for me next i think

[02:05] <hahainternet> moving windows around is just getting too tiresome

[02:05] <timotimo> i've been on tiling WMs for a whole while

[02:05] <choiboi> same

[02:05] <timotimo> turns out all i really need is split left/right and move between screens

[02:05] <hahainternet> well gnome already has that

[02:05] <hahainternet> meta+left, meta+right

[02:05] <hahainternet> but i'd like a bit more

[02:05] <timotimo> yeah, i'm on xfce4 which also has that

[02:05] <choiboi> hahainternet: like automatic tiling?

[02:06] <hahainternet> choiboi: some grammar for modifying them

[02:06] <hahainternet> ala vim

[02:06] <choiboi> I'm running 2bwm (which is not tiling

[02:06] *** w_richard_w joined
[02:06] <hahainternet> jwl for examle, 'join window left' might be a good idiom

[02:06] <choiboi> hahainternet: sick

[02:06] <hahainternet> i genuinely don't know :)

[02:06] <timotimo> what is the "two borders" thing about?

[02:07] <timotimo> oh, it's like status bars? or per-window borders like title bars?

[02:07] <choiboi> timotimo: are you asking me?

[02:07] <timotimo> yeah

[02:08] <choiboi> timotimo: tbh not really sure... I know if I wanted to I could configure the borders a lot but I run a mostly stock setup

[02:08] <timotimo> when i was running i3 i built a python script that can parse arbitrary text files that have color codes in them and rotate the hue around

[02:09] <timotimo> i had it set up to rotate by a little every ~hour or so i guess?

[02:09] <hahainternet> hah that's cute i use a similar thing for a background that changes throughout the day

[02:09] <choiboi> timotimo: oh, that would probably require writing C for 2bwm since its basically a floating version of dwm

[02:09] <hahainternet> but it's very hard to find a good series of panoramic timelapses 24 hours long

[02:10] <hahainternet> in fact, i only found one nice one, and i emailed the author asking to license the raws, and he did not respond to me :(

[02:10] <timotimo> :(

[02:10] <choiboi> :(

[02:10] <timotimo> reminds me (barely) of Looking Glass 3d where there was one demo that had live(?) video from the campus it was developed at as the background

[02:11] <choiboi> timotimo: there is a timelapse of my campus having construction right now (I go to Daytona State College)

[02:12] <hahainternet> i think what i'll do at some point is install gta v again

[02:13] <hahainternet> see if i can get it to render at 6880x1880

[02:13] <hahainternet> and then do a timelapse in that from a nice vantage point

[02:13] <choiboi> hahainternet: how big is your monitor!!!?

[02:13] <hahainternet> choiboi: 3440x1440

[02:13] <hahainternet> s/1880/2880 above

[02:16] <hahainternet> choiboi: counterpoint: they've never been more popular, just not comparatively more

[02:17] <hahainternet> it may just be that kids in my family are all boys, so they're all obsessed with fortnite

[02:17] <choiboi> hahainternet: I don't like fortnite

[02:18] <choiboi> my friends play it and I feel like they are wasting their time but its not my life so.. xD

[02:18] <hahainternet> i'm about 2x too old to be playing it, but honestly gaming can build friendships, it can be good

[02:18] <hahainternet> don't be afraid to bond, especially when you're young

[02:19] <hahainternet> just don't get sucked into gamer "culture"

[02:19] <choiboi> hahainternet: ah luckily here if I wanna bond with someone I can just go to the beach ^_^

[02:20] <choiboi> I like games still though but I don't have the attention span to play one for over 20 minutes

[02:25] <timotimo> long before i realized daytona is a place, this song had been embedded, nay burned, into my mind

[02:25] <timotimo> i didn't even play the game ?!?

[02:26] <timotimo> TBF i only just learned this or maybe late last year that daytona is a place

[02:26] <hahainternet> hah, here's my equivalent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n__WagRmTw0#t=13m

[02:26] <timotimo> :D

[02:27] <timotimo> the first racing sim i remember playing was NFS2, actually, i'm not that old yet

[02:27] <MasterDuke> ahh, NFS. loved those. Porsche Unleashed is one of my favorite games of all time

[02:28] <hahainternet> i'm fairly sure i played the original, god that's depressing :)

[02:28] <choiboi> timotimo: that is not what the daytona 500 looks like at all xD

[02:28] <hahainternet> Release years by system:

[02:28] <hahainternet> 1994 – 3DO Interactive Multiplayer[6]

[02:28] <timotimo> though i think my dad tried to get me to like Grand Prix 2, but it was a bit too difficult for me; it's rather a lot more realistic from the simulation aspect

[02:33] <hahainternet> i tell you something choiboi as an old person, here's one bit of advice

[02:33] <hahainternet> accept all the education you can get

[02:33] <hahainternet> cause i'm in my 30s and finding it hard to conceptualise stuff that i would have been taught at 24 if i'd stayed the course

[02:33] <hahainternet> i don't even know how to start it, or even how to start starting it

[02:36] *** vike1 left
[02:37] <timotimo> make sure your mother had her belly listen to mozart while you were still in there

[02:38] <hahainternet> hah, you say that in jest

[02:38] <hahainternet> but isn't there some evidence behind that?

[02:38] <timotimo> not actually sure

[02:38] <hahainternet> anyhow i don't mean general intelligence, i mean the complex logic of things like set theory / type theory

[02:38] <hahainternet> it requires your brain to be molded to a way of thinking

[02:38] <Xliff> Is there a way to set timeout of an awaited promise?

[02:38] <hahainternet> and at my age, neuroplasticity isn't what it was

[02:39] <timotimo> Xliff: nah, you'd use a second promise (Promise.in) and then await Promise.anyof($foo, $bar)

[02:39] <hahainternet> in another 5-10 years i won't be able to keep up with the changes in the industry

[02:39] <hahainternet> and then i'm done

[02:39] <Xliff> I want to do "our $a; $a = Promise.new; #... does something... #; await $a;"

[02:39] <hahainternet> make an object that wraps a promise

[02:39] <hahainternet> internally it can await both can't it?

[02:39] <Xliff> And hold that await indefinitely until something else keeps the promise.

[02:40] <hahainternet> Xliff: you just said 'set timeout' but now you say 'indefinitely'?

[02:40] <hahainternet> those seem to be dichotomies, am i confused?

[02:40] <Xliff> hahainternet: Well, I've tried this before, and the await will terminate after a certain amount of time.

[02:41] <Xliff> I'd like to make that "amount of time" something longer than the default.

[02:41] <hahainternet> is there a default timeout?

[02:41] <hahainternet> i'm not sure i'm aware of one

[02:41] <Xliff> I don't know how 6.d is doing it now. My code is still in 6.c until I have time to refactor all of the changes.

[02:42] <hahainternet> i'd wait for timotimo et al who know more than I :)

[02:42] <choiboi> hahainternet: I go to college for free. The state of Florida pays for my school

[02:42] *** cpan-p6 left
[02:42] <Xliff> I made a simple test.

[02:43] <hahainternet> thanks to our terrible government

[02:43] <Xliff> perl6 -e 'my $a = Promise.new; await $a' # Should be an infinite loop

[02:44] <choiboi> hahainternet: tbh I don't want to finish my degree. I got offered a job to work for a major tobacco company (Gudang Garam)

[02:45] <hahainternet> imho i'd do anything to go back and finish a CS/Engineering degree

[02:45] <hahainternet> so take that as you will :)

[02:46] <Xliff> choiboi: Well, good luck with the job, but see if they will allow you time to complete your degree.

[02:46] <timotimo> a promise will not resolve itself, i might be misunderstanding?

[02:46] <Xliff> Do NOT allow your degree to go unfinished. Most companies will allow you to complete on their dime. Investigate if you can make use of it.

[02:46] <Xliff> timotimo: No. I am trying to stop operation of code until the promise is manually kept.

[02:47] <Xliff> Hence the " #... does something... #"

[02:47] *** aborazmeh left
[02:47] <Xliff> I just wanted to make sure the "await $a" will sit there until that happens.

[02:47] <timotimo> you want something to pause while the promise is in planned state?

[02:50] <timotimo> the change in 6.d that's relevant for await is that if you're awaiting from a task that's in a ThreadPoolScheduler, the task will get put back in the queue, which means a different worker may resume it

[02:55] <Xliff> timotimo: OK. I'm still in v6.c

[02:56] <Xliff> That will help when I can finally release all of this crap and then move to 6.d

[02:56] <choiboi> I'll definetely ask if I can complete my degree

[03:07] <choiboi> does index.css apply to all html files or just index.html?

[03:07] <timotimo> it depends on what's in the html file, rather than the filenames

[03:07] <choiboi> timotimo: what do I need to add?

[03:08] <timotimo> there'll be a <link rel="stylesheet" href="..." /> or maybe src="..."

[03:08] <timotimo> i always look it up whenever i need it, though actually i mostly work with templates that already come with a few things

[09:33] <jmerelo> I have added a new proyect idea to the Google Summer of Code repo: https://perl-gsoc-2019.github.io/ideas/perl6/community-modules.html It's about working on some community-adopted modules that are not receiving all the love they should

[09:41] <tadzik> (as an LWP::Simple replacement)

[09:42] <jmerelo> tadzik: it's a more flexible and complex module. LWP::Simple is, well, simple. There's another module, WWW, which is similar and also adopted by the community

[09:54] <patrickb> .tell jnthn Could you type together a project idea in the ideas repo for the dynamic optimizer idea you tweeted about? That should hopefully greatly increase the visibility of that idea for students. (https://github.com/perl-gsoc-2019/ideas/blob/master/mentors-guide.md#adding-ideas)

[09:54] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[09:54] <jmerelo> Hi, patrickb

[09:54] <patrickb> .tell jnthn It's great you're willing to mentor!

[09:54] <yoleaux> patrickb: I'll pass your message to jnthn.

[09:54] <patrickb> Hi there. :-)

[09:55] <jmerelo> patrickb: just thinking about a few more ideas... the most we have, with all different levels, the easier it will be to attract students

[09:55] <jmerelo> I guess...

[09:56] <patrickb> true...

[09:57] <jmerelo> patrickb: I have also seen that some organizations are making @ references in Twitter to user groups. Should we do that? Can we target some specific groups? Is it worth the while?

[09:58] <patrickb> I'm too unexperienced with Twitter to have an informed opinion. But increasing reach is probably always a Good Thing.

[09:59] *** sena_kun joined
[09:59] <jmerelo> patrickb: OK, I'll see if I create a list and start to mention them. Including, for instance, Perl mongers and youth or any other kind of collective coding groups

[10:00] <patrickb> I think by far most of the time students will come to our ideas page via the official GSoC site.

[10:00] <jmerelo> patrickb: the problem is that these would be actually interested and informed about GSoC. That leaves a lot of people that don't.

[10:02] *** domidumont left
[10:02] <patrickb> True. I think the most potent target group is the one already having a relation to perl in some way.

[14:56] <tadzik> https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends

[14:56] <tadzik> We are using a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) based calculation to determine the stipend. We start with a base amount of 6000 USD and then adjust it based on each country's PPP value. There is a minimum (3000 USD) and maximum (6600 USD) stipend amount.

[22:08] <yoleaux> 16:52Z <jmerelo> tbrowder: I don't think it's changed from the original 5.5K. Did patrickb say the same?

[23:26] <TreyHarris> Is there a better way of dealing with passing along optionality of arguments to successive functions than this? https://gist.github.com/507c511dd34b96a3df4b3dae51c0b94e

[23:27] <TreyHarris> Like, `put $opt_arg ?? foo($opt_arg) !! foo()`?

[23:34] <jnthn> Maybe `put foo(|($opt_arg || Empty))`

[23:34] <TreyHarris> I'm writing a shim library where I need to take the same arguments as the subs in the original (plus some in some cases), massage the arguments, and pass them along, and when there are two or three optional arguments it gets hairy to "just call it like I was called please"

[23:34] <jnthn> Though be careful if $opt_arg is something flattenable

[23:47] <TreyHarris> jnthn: I updated the gist (https://gist.github.com/507c511dd34b96a3df4b3dae51c0b94e) -- thanks, I assumed "Empty" would only work for the entire capture---didn't realize I could use it piecewise like that before

[23:48] <TreyHarris> It's still kinda uggly, but it works
