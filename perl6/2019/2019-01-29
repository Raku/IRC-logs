[00:17] <tyil> El_Che: I'm going to rewrite parts anyway, I can remove coloring altogether if people think its more annoying than helpful

[00:18] <tyil> I want it to not have a memory leak above all, though, so it doesnt restart so often

[00:18] <tyil> I kinda dislike the spam it generates by joining so often, but I also want to inform its a bot on joining and show the source in case anyone has improvements

[00:18] <El_Che> tyil: yes, it's green, but a very light one. It looks like a highlight when you don't look attentively

[00:18] <El_Che> not that annoying, and maybe it's just me

[00:19] <tyil> my highlights are red, so I don't notice that :p

[00:19] <timotimo> saying it when it joins isn't bad, but i seem to recall other bots answer to "myname: source"

[00:19] <tyil> it responds to .bots to show the source too

[00:19] <tyil> maybe that alone is enough

[00:19] <timotimo> is that meant for all bots to identify themselves?

[00:20] <tyil> that's a common standard among bots from what I've seen in my years on irc

[00:20] <timotimo> interesting, i'm not sure i've seen that

[00:20] <tyil> it usually reports the bot as "reporting in" or for duty, the lang it's made in (or the lib) and an url to the source

[00:21] <tyil> or an informational page, if its not free software

[00:21] <El_Che> tyil: http://claudio.ulyssis.be/var/tmp/tyil.png

[00:21] <tyil> ah, the green on its own nick (same green as the PAUSE ID)

[00:22] <tyil> coloring in irc messages is hard, since nobody is guaranteed to use the same colors

[00:22] <El_Che> the tyil yellow is the highlight

[00:22] <tyil> might be best to just not add coloring at all I think

[00:22] <timotimo> i sometimes appreciate a little bit of boldface

[00:23] <El_Che> I think that omitting colours is a good idea as a bot should be subtle

[00:23] <tyil> this is how it looks for me https://a.uguu.se/45xIzxng0GQL_window-20190129012213.png

[00:23] <tyil> timotimo: bolding/underscoring is usually not interfered with in user settings, so those should be fine

[00:25] <tyil> thanks for the feedback El_Che and timotimo, I'll take it with me when working on the bot again

[00:25] <tyil> though I can't say for sure when that'll be, I'm moving to Amsterdam, but on the way to FOSDEM I might have time (which would be Friday)

[00:26] <El_Che> tyil: moving from where?

[00:26] <El_Che> (and when I hear Amsterdam I hear Booking)

[00:26] <tyil> samcv's working at booking, which is part of the reason we're moving there

[00:27] <tyil> I come from Gorinchem, another city in the Netherlands

[00:27] <guifa> SmokeMachine: the trick I think for me making the ~==  is just trying to cover as many possibilities as I can.  Right now the conversion tends to work by piggy-backing signature coercion, which is definitely better than nothing.  Eventually though I figure I'll start to put in edge cases wherever I come across them

[00:27] <El_Che> tyil: ah, you're an item?

[00:27] <tyil> I'm working at another company in Amsterdam, where I'm slowly introducing more Perl 6 tools :D

[00:27] <tyil> it appears so, yes :)

[00:27] <timotimo> i guess true change has to come from within :P

[00:28] <El_Che> tyil: we'll meet IRL if you're moving so close. I am from .be

[00:28] <tyil> oh, cool

[00:28] <tyil> we can certainly do that :D

[00:30] <tyil> I'm having an asian friend over the week after fosdem, and he'll be staying with me for a week

[00:30] <tyil> I'll be off of work all week as well

[02:40] <tbrowder> i may have misstated, but i need to look closer at what really happened and ensure the result is correct. i will report back eventually because i think it is a very useful construct, at least it is for me. it can be embellished with shasums to determine if the module needs transforming again, etc.

[10:23] <tyil> jast: I'm continuing use of IRC, but part of the IRC elitism is knowing IRC is small and easily integrated, and you can prove that by bridging irc into pretty much anything

[10:23] <jast> stop ruining my lame joke by being all reasonable ;P

[10:23] <tyil> the thing Matrix, Discord, XMPP and all other things have in common is having IRC bridges :p

[10:24] <timotimo> i suggest we get our communities on zero-k chat. it has a discord bridge, which includes the ability to bridge to IRC, but it also has a cool 3d real-time strategy game attached to it :P

[10:24] <tyil> lol

[10:25] <timotimo> (obviously that's not a sensible suggestion, but zero-k is pretty cool, go try it out if you're interested in RTS at all)

[10:26] <jast> I'm the worst at RTS

[10:26] <tyil> oh, it's free as in freedom

[10:26] <timotimo> it is!

[10:26] <tyil> that's pretty cool, timotimo 

[10:26] <timotimo> i'm bad at it, also i can't play a lot for practice because RSI tends to happen from that

[10:26] <tyil> I'm bad at RTSes too, which is why I only play casually with friends if I play games at all :p

[10:27] <tyil> then we can at least all be bad, so it's not an issue

[10:27] <timotimo> but it does have a single-player campaign that's pretty varied, and bots that only use the information they're getting in their vision range, but will still play well

[13:18] <ufobat_> isnt it possible to check, once in a week whether there is an update on a module that is not hosted on github?

[13:18] <ufobat_> asking for the p6weekly, lizmat 

[13:18] <sena_kun> lizmat, o/ I am not sure if this is a mistake, but in latest weekly in tweet section there is a link missing, just `by 奈良阪まぞく@VRChat Profile.` is shown.

[13:19] <lizmat> sena_kun: probably a mistake, lemme check

[13:19] <ufobat_> all the community "managed" modules are not on cpan.

[13:19] <lizmat> ufobat_: if you have a simple way for me to do that for a certain period, then I will do that

[13:19] <tyil> ufobat_: they appear in the ecosystem repo, right?

[13:20] <ufobat_> tyil, right

[13:20] <lizmat> until I know of such a way, I'm afraid I'm going to be lazy :-)

[13:20] <ufobat_> lizmat, zef does the job already, no?

[13:20] <tyil> I'm probably able to make a simple importer of all those jsons in there

[13:20] <ufobat_> lizmat, btw there is a bug in the current weekly, it is not "Martin Timmerman" but "Marcel Timmerman"

[13:20] <lizmat> zef does that how ?

[13:21] <ufobat_> if it doesn't then i am mistaken, i thought zef was aware of versions of modules on Github

[13:21] <tyil> it's relatively easy to make something for it in the cpan db I'm already keeping

[13:21] <tyil> but I have cpan-p6 to fix before I take on a new task :p

[13:22] <ufobat_> but in general, isnt it just foreach @ecosystem -> $module { $module.fetch_tags.compare-with-what-i-remember() }

[13:22] <lizmat> ufobat_: I'm open to improvements... :-)

[13:22] <lizmat> as long as it doesn't add to my workload  :-)

[13:22] <tyil> I keep insertion dates in my db

[13:23] <tyil> so if I have code to import the modules from github, one can just run it at given intervals and SELECT everything from the last 7 days

[13:23] <tyil> DISTINCT on module name

[13:23] <tyil> and you should be done

[13:23] <ufobat_> tyil, i think this information needs to be polled?

[13:24] <tyil> unless we can get all modules on github to fire a webhook on new releases we'll have to poll them

[13:24] <ufobat_> lizmat, did you notice the bug, on updated perl modules?

[13:24] <ufobat_> but polling them woudn't be a big problem

[13:25] <lizmat> ufobat_: what bug ?

[13:25] <tyil> all you need to do is download the latest META6.json

[13:25] <ufobat_> it is not "Martin timmerman" it is "Marcel Timmerman"

[13:25] <ufobat_> wrong name

[13:25] <tyil> I don't know how many requests github allows, though

[13:25] <lizmat> yeah fixed that, and sena_kun's issue

[13:25] <ufobat_> k :)

[13:25] <sena_kun> lizmat++

[13:25] <tyil> I poll cpan every couple minutes

[15:47] <ufobat_> Some more thoughts on Testo, I think testo intentionally left out ok() not-ok() but is testing it with WhateverCode like this:

[15:47] <ufobat_> is 1 ~~ 2, *.so, 'test if something that matched is so';

[15:48] <ufobat_> you could also test: is "foo", *.contains("o"), 'contains "o"';

[15:48] <ufobat_> but i cant think of a good way to "describe" the expectation, $expectation.perl or $expectation($got-value); doesnt give reasonable output

[16:33] <atroxaper> .tell jnthn Hello. We have talked about debugger and mac in CommaIDE 2018-06-23. MoarVM uses 'localhost' word and CommaIDE uses '127.0.0.1'. That is why I'm getting CouldNotConnectException while starting a debug. You were going to change the word in CommaIDE, but as I see in decompiled code you didn't :) This is right? Could you fix it in the next release?

[16:35] <jnthn> atroxaper: Huh, I did put in a patch that tries both ::1 and 127.0.0.1. What else could localhost possibly be?

[16:35] <jnthn> Actually it used to use localhost

[16:36] <jnthn> But that could resolve differently to how it resolved in MoarVM, the solution being "try both in turn"

[16:38] <atroxaper> jnthn: Hm... I don't know what to say :) It worked when I rebuild MoarVM and "127.0.0.1".

[17:28] <atroxaper> jnthn: my things... As I see in JavaDoc, you use InetSocketAddress(hostname, port) method for creating addresses. Probably you may use just 'localhost' as hostname in the method. Or 'new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getLoopbackAddress(), port)'. I understand that you try to use IPv4 and IPv6 together, but I cannot find a way to create a loopback address separately for both protocols by open method. You can create both loopback addresses f

[20:29] <timotimo> you can actually have an unpsace that's just a \ iirc

[23:59] <jnthn> It'll work, though fair warning: a hash table keyed on the enum elements and with code objects as the values will probably perform notably better. :)

[23:59] <hythm_> noted.

[23:59] <jnthn> But if it's not a hot path, sure, enjoy the multis. Who knows, we might figure out how to make it fast some day... :)

[23:59] <jnthn> I guess nobody types *that* fast...
