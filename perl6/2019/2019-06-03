[02:59] <elcaro> ok, guess it's always been like that. a little bit WAT but I understand why

[03:01] <elcaro> ahh I was confused... it failes on the assigment... not on the binding to parameter. nothing to see here, carry on.

[08:25] <lizmat> Xliff: not sure what to make of that...  could you elaborate (was I supposed to know about your project?)

[08:25] <Xliff> No. It's just the amount of work I've put into my perl6 projects.

[08:25] <lizmat> ah.. cool...  quite a bit  :-)

[08:26] <Xliff> I am stuck on an aspect of Pango that I can't work out. That's one blocker.

[08:26] <lizmat> :-(   is that something the Perl 6 community could help with?

[08:26] <Xliff> And the current installation methods used by zef are another. p6-GtkPlus can take over an hour on some machines. That's a long time to wait for zef.

[08:26] <Xliff> ^^ Would prefer help with this.

[08:26] <lizmat> have you upgraded zef ?

[08:26] <Xliff> Ues.

[08:26] <Xliff> Yes, even.

[08:27] <Xliff> The big issue is that it's a LARGE compile, and I want to see if there are ways to speed it up.

[08:27] <Xliff> Also...want regular output so that users installing it know that something is going on.

[08:28] <Xliff> I have to rewrite the build instructions. I had to go to a custom set of scripts to compile and run everything.

[08:28] <Xliff> Would like to release something before winter.

[08:29] <lizmat> perhaps installing with RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 could be helpful...

[08:29] <lizmat> OTH, that might be too much

[08:30] <lizmat> OTH, I've often wanted to have something like that less debuggy, more informational

[08:30] <Xliff> Yes. I've tried that. It's a good idea to do that once and let it spit out to a log file for later observation.

[08:32] <Xliff> lizmat: Well, to build p6-GtkPlus is simple enough. Clone it, cd to the directory and then run ./build.sh

[08:32] <Xliff> Would love it if you could build it and let me know the total time it takes.

[08:32] <lizmat> Xliff: should it work on a Mac out of the box?

[08:32] <Xliff> (Yes, also keeping regular stats of compile times vs perl6 version for those folks who like numbers)

[08:32] <Xliff> lizmat: If GTK is there, then yes.

[08:33] <Xliff> GLib and GTK

[08:33] <lizmat> how can I check if GLib and GTK are there?

[08:33] <lizmat> or will it tell me

[08:33] <Xliff> I am not sure with Mac

[08:34] <Xliff> pkgutil --pkgs?

[08:37] <lizmat> tried "brew install GLib"

[08:38] <lizmat> dies on trying to install python 3.7

[08:38] <Xliff> :(

[08:38] <lizmat> anyways... P6W time now... 

[08:38] <Xliff> OK. Maybe I will grab a VM that has X11 and see if I can set it up there.

[08:39] <Xliff> Maybe another small AWS install so folks can test it.

[08:39] <Xliff> At any rate... nn! o7

[17:15] <jmerelo> vrurg: did you get hold of one of those cardboard-pressed records that apparently were used in the USSR in the early 80s?

[17:16] <vrurg> It was a cassete. 3-5-many re-recordings, horrible sound quality. And a bit of real stuff in the trashy atmosphere of SU music. ;)

[17:17] <vrurg> Ah, no, sorry. Manowar was presented to my by a Bulgaridan frined and his copy was ok. But Accept and Iron Maiden were... special, to say.

[17:54] <El_Che> I had a pretty negative view on how it's done here, and was pretty surprised that the university president (rector) pretty much said the same thing today at a talk i attended

[17:54] <El_Che> (I wondered how it's done elsewhere)

[17:55] <jmerelo> El_Che: Well, there's no bridge or collaboration between actual computer scientists and humanities people, far as I know

[17:55] <El_Che> that's sad

[17:55] <jmerelo> El_Che: it's mostly journalists or people from fine arts who do a bit of Python

[17:56] <El_Che> here there is a joint master of Digital Humanities between CompSci and Lit/Linguistics but it's a joke
