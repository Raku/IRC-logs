[03:18] <konobi> TimToady: i have a bit of an abstract language question/idea that i'd wonder how it'd fit into perl6 smoothly

[03:24] <konobi> namely, using perl6 strings (maybe with some sort of sigil) to indicate a multilingual string that should/may have maketext-style translation strings with the current string as it's key. then use a combination of the grammar engine and a list of .po files to show which keys have a translations available and which ones, so that translation can be done reactively

[03:46] <lucs> konobi: He pops up every once in a while on irc.perl.org (as TorgoX).

[07:54] <Ulti> I just noticed this whilst answering...

[07:55] <Ulti> any reason to delete your content?

[07:55] <gfldex> i found that other users can edit my posts without my consent. Also I never really liked the whole gamification bullshit.

[07:56] <Ulti> really? I wasnt aware of that, there is an edit history though

[07:57] <Ulti> oh yeah I can edit them, but apparantly its in an edit queue that has to be approved

[07:57] *** TEttinger left
[07:57] <gfldex> the whole platform seams to be attractive to folk with a mindset that is calles Blockwartmentalität in german. Fairly hard to translate but very repelling to me.

[07:58] <gfldex> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockwart

[07:58] <Ulti> I think we would just say fascist in English

[07:59] <gfldex> not at all

[07:59] <gfldex> it's more PC going wrong, helicoper parents, triggerwarning etc.

[07:59] <Ulti> but still you aren't deleting your answers but instead editing them to mention you are quitting

[08:00] <gfldex> i can't delete accepted answers, it simply wont let me

[08:00] <Ulti> so now we have a "community" there which is quite often solo answers that just state you are leaving

[08:00] <gfldex> and i can only edit 5 messaged per day

[08:01] <gfldex> i agree that is ugly but my options are limited. I did try to get in contect with support, no reply yet.

[08:02] <gfldex> also, if the "community" is mostly me answering questions, i would question that there is any community at all

[08:02] <Ulti> sure I agree but I've answered a few solo too

[08:02] *** pmurias joined
[08:02] <Ulti> its more if someone gives a good answer there isnt much point following it up, since no one here is in the "game"

[08:02] <gfldex> i would like to add that it's the same person and one of many forced edits by the same guy

[08:03] *** TEttinger joined
[08:03] <Ulti> have you flagged up the user?

[08:03] <gfldex> as I wrote earlier, if anyone believes it has value, pick up the torch

[08:04] <Ulti> also what sorts of edits? just spelling or something more nefarious?

[08:04] <pmurias> konobi: you want to use grammars to determine which translation string don't have a .po string for a given language?

[08:05] <gfldex> way beyond spelling and frankly, I grow tired discussing it. I wanted to write a blog post for 3 days now.

[08:06] <gfldex> but then the title is "Lazy all the way down" so that delay may actually quite fitting :)

[08:06] *** andrzejku left
[08:08] *** TEttinger left
[08:09] <Ulti> well thanks for sharing the circumstance, I'm surprised there is no moderation for this sort of thing

[08:09] *** firstdayonthejob joined
[08:09] <Ulti> minimally you should be able to block a user from editing your content

[08:09] *** andrzejku joined
[08:10] <gfldex> they can't do that without breaking the gamification-reward-carrot

[08:10] <gfldex> you gain power by providing accepted answer

[08:11] <gfldex> at some point you become rewarded with the ability to force your will on others and get even more carrots for doing so

[08:11] <Ulti> gfldex one thing I can see your full answer history...

[08:12] <Ulti> like if I just click on your history for a "I am leaving" I can just see your old answer anyway

[08:14] <gfldex> indeed, I have very little power over my one unpayed for work

[08:14] <gfldex> hance the quitting

[08:15] <gfldex> there is no easy way out and I believe that to be intentional

[08:16] *** cygx joined
[08:16] <cygx> gfldex: note that when you joined stackexchange, you agreed to license your content under creative commone attribution share-alike

[08:16] <cygx> they are fully within their rights to restore anything you deleted

[08:16] <Ulti> gfldex: are you talking about "Christopher Bottoms" which is the only editor I can see?

[08:17] <pmurias> gfldex: by stackexchange you are referring to stackoverflow?

[08:19] *** TEttinger joined
[08:19] <cygx> arguably, removing your content is something of a dick move - wou don't remve your content from Wikipedia when you stop contributing

[08:19] <cygx> just delete the user so it's no longer associated with you

[08:19] <gfldex> stackexchange is one of the many "communities" under the privately held stackoverflow umrella

[08:20] <geekosaur> other way around

[08:20] <geekosaur> stackoverflow is one of many stackexchange sites

[08:20] <Ulti> gfldex: all I can see is that guy corrected your grammar and added `` for code words in your text, I would be glad if someone did that. I usually have four edits of my answers where I worry about grammar

[08:20] *** nadim joined
[08:21] <gfldex> cygx: i that case i am happily guilty of a dick move. They could have told me in nice friendly letters when I signed up. Sadly they choose to hide that information under a mountain of ToS.

[08:21] *** toku_bass joined
[08:22] <gfldex> Util: you see less then I see then. That again is likely intentional. Maybe if you gained more carrots you can see all of it.

[08:23] <Ulti> well its more I gave up after the first two edits I found

[08:25] <gfldex> cygx: also, since I am not paid for my work I feel strangely entitled to that dick move.

[08:25] *** TEttinger left
[08:26] *** toku_bass left
[08:27] <cygx> gfldex: I think of it more or less the same way I think of contributing to WIkipedia or an open source project

[08:27] <cygx> the content is no longer yours exclusively

[08:27] *** TEttinger joined
[08:31] <Ulti> gfldex my attitude towards that end is usually tempered by I feel the people who asked a question and used your answer are now entitled to that content too you wouldnt go back and wipe someones mind of a conversation you had just because you didn't want them to have it anymore

[08:31] <pmurias> just quiting seems saner then waging an edit war with people driven by brownie points

[08:31] <gfldex> cygx: then our opinion differ. I believe the perspective of making someone quit by pissing that person of should come with consequences, that go beyond seeing somebodies back. Power should be balanced and have consequences.

[08:32] <Ulti> that you arent actually removing the content but making it hard to read and replacing it with a message about you leaving is also extra drastic, which I agree is a failing of Stack Overflow

[08:32] <gfldex> pmurias: are you suggesting that I am insane?

[08:33] <gfldex> actually, I believe it is better I part this channel for a while. I wanted to get stuff done.

[08:33] *** gfldex left
[08:35] <Ulti> :( 

[08:36] <Ulti> I am kind of amazed you cant just delete your account

[08:37] <cygx> Ulti: it's like Wikipedia - the user can go, the content stays - though I do no longer see the delete button in my profile where it used to be...

[08:37] <Ulti> well I'm in a stay at home mood I might go through and try and independently answer everything gfldex solo answered :[

[08:38] <Ulti> is it possible to block people so you dont see the answers? that way I can properly claim I'm not just reverting gfldex's content

[08:39] *** andrzejku left
[08:39] <cygx> apparently, you need to go through the contact support page to get an account deleted

[08:39] <Ulti> I respect his right to not have his stuff on there regardless of ToS you can't actually give up copyright in the UK its an intrinsic right... despite what anyone tells you

[08:40] <cygx> Ulti: but he has granted a usage license, and he's trying to revoke that

[08:40] <Ulti> sure but in the UK he would have the legal right to do so

[08:40] <Ulti> its not possible for a third party to remove that right from someone

[08:41] <Ulti> but yeah digital content doesnt really work like a piece of writing on paper :/

[08:41] <cygx> Ulti: but a licensee is within his rights to sue you if you just go back on a license agreement

[08:42] <cygx> what woud have to be argued is that the agreement is void because the the terms where not clear

[08:42] <Ulti> you could probably even argue it was rendered to HTML on another server and so is a different work

[08:42] *** andrzejku joined
[08:42] <Ulti> cygx they could try but I'd hope a court would be more on the side of gfldex

[08:43] <Ulti> he hadnt consciously agreed to a system where others could edit his stuff

[08:44] <Ulti> not that I agree with defacing your existing content :S

[08:44] *** TEttinger left
[08:46] <Ulti> :( gfldex nearly always had the best answer but others have mostly put something up too

[08:48] <cygx> Ulti: it's not exactly prominently advertized that others can edit your posts, but it's not exactly hidden either

[08:48] <cygx> When should I edit posts? - Any time you feel you can make the post better, and are inclined to do so. Editing is encouraged!

[08:48] *** RabidGravy joined
[08:51] <Ulti> I have to say on the concept of editing peoples content I'm more on the shock side with gfldex, Wikipedia does not directly attribute content to you directly

[08:52] <Ulti> someone could completely change my comment and my name would still be on it

[08:52] <Ulti> thats open to defaming soemone

[08:54] <Ulti> though you are rate limited on the edits so its not like you could systematically alter someones voice 

[08:54] <cygx> Ulti: you need to have aquired enough karma to be able to edit posts without someone else approving it

[08:54] <cygx> if you abuse that power, you risk being banned and losing your karma

[08:54] *** TEttinger joined
[08:54] <cygx> as far as I know, it works reasonably well

[08:56] <Ulti> sure I dont really have much of a problem with it

[08:56] <Ulti> but it does sound like there isn't much of a mechanism to prevent bad things either if you are one of the lower level users

[08:56] <Ulti> Wikipedia was incredibly infuriating at times

[08:57] <Ulti> I stopped editing after a while just because it got so annoying

[11:13] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: sooo… how to delete all of your stackoverflow answers?

[11:13] <AlexDaniel> did you figure out? :)

[11:14] <gfldex> not yet, no reply from support

[11:16] <gfldex> given that they earn money via ads one might think they got the money to pay someone to answer support calls. But I doubt they pay enough to convince anyone to work on sundays.

[11:16] <AlexDaniel> or maybe just renaming your account to “IamNotUsingStackoverflowAnymore” should work?

[11:19] <gfldex> as I understand it you can have your account deleted, what will remove your name from the work you did. The work however will stay.

[11:20] <AlexDaniel> my score doubled since I stopped writing any answers, but it will take another year or two at such pace (or maybe more?) till I get access to moderator tools, but I don't think that this will help me in any way…

[11:22] <AlexDaniel> well it kinda makes sense that the answers are going to stay, given that you kinda contributed it under CC-SA license

[11:23] <gfldex> i wonder if they can show me my signature under that contract

[11:27] *** n1lp7r left
[11:27] *** skaji_ left
[11:31] <smls> Ulti: re "someone could completely change my comment and my name would still be on it": It shows that it was edited, and by whom, right next to your name.

[11:31] <AlexDaniel> not sure if that's a good question. I think that the best solution is to write a nice well-thought-out blog post post on why you hate stackoverflow and why everyone should stop using it. At least, that's what I did…

[11:33] <smls> Ulti: Also, the idea of SO is that answers are not someone's "comment", but rather form a collaborative database, kinda like a wiki.

[11:33] <gfldex> i do not believe one bit that everyone should stop using it. If one is fine with surrendering freedom for the common good, I'm not going to disagree. I am just sad that they didn't tell that I have to do that _before_ I signed up.

[11:34] <smls> Ulti: Only the little comment section below answers, functions like a forum where each comment is considered a message by its auther. Not the answres themselves.

[11:35] *** cygx joined
[11:35] <AlexDaniel> what kind of freedom? You want to delete your contributions? But… did anybody tell you that it wont be possible to delete your awesome contributions to perl 6 documentation? ;)

[11:40] <cygx> well, the terms of servives explain that your contributions will be released under cc by-sa, the tour mentions that "As you earn reputation, you'll unlock new privileges like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.", but if you want detail, you do need to navigate to http://stackoverflow.com/help/editing

[11:40] <cygx> perhaps that link should be mentioned at signup

[11:41] <gfldex> in the case of the docs I did make my homework and informed myself what license I license my work with to the general public. Yet I reserve the freedom express my _wish_ to remove my contributions in the future, fully aware of the fact that I have no right to demand a wish to be fulfilled.

[11:43] *** TEttinger left
[11:44] <gfldex> I found that if there is good reason to be polite, you get more politeness. :)

[11:44] *** TEttinger joined
[11:46] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: but isn't it correct to say that it's your fault that you did not inform yourself?

[11:46] *** grondilu left
[11:47] <Ulti> smls that SO want it to be that way *and* also rely on direct attribution is kind of the problem you can't have both... imagine Wikipedia if every edit diff had the users name next to it

[11:47] <gfldex> one could make that argument. But then one could make the argument that a body that calls itself a "community" should respect the wishes of members of that "community" esp. if they want to take their ball and go home. If they refuse to respect that wish one could call them a "cult".

[11:49] <Ulti> the editing at a minimum should be controlled by the OP having someone be able to edit over you without permission is kind of weird... you could always make it so that you can trust a given user so they can do what they like

[11:49] <cygx> Ulti: any user that gains 2000 reputation is autumatically trusted

[11:51] <Ulti> right but you can have 2000 reputation without any respect or reputation from the person or even sub community you are editing in

[11:51] <smls> Ulti: Wikipedia does list the user names next to all diffs in the "View history" tab.

[11:51] <Ulti> sure but not on the actual article people are reading

[11:52] <Ulti> how often (if ever) do you check the history of an SO answer?

[11:52] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: you only get 100 rep points on other SE websites though

[11:52] <Ulti> the vast majority of people dont even realise it's there on wikipedia

[11:52] <Ulti> AlexDaniel SO only I mean

[11:53] <Ulti> so someone with 2k reputation answering python questions should be trusted for perl answers?

[11:53] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: haha, that's a good point

[11:53] <Ulti> I'm not saying any of it is bad, just the implementation feels a little off

[11:53] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: see this https://files.progarm.org/2014-11-16-181838_757x724_scrot.png

[11:53] <smls> Ulti: Yeah, attribution is displayed less *prominently* on Wikipedia, but that's a difference of degree, not a fundamental one.

[11:53] <Ulti> like its open to some abuse that could easily be avoided

[11:53] <Ulti> the edit rate limiting is what they chose

[11:53] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: that's a message I got from some guy having a lot of answers about powershell

[11:55] <Ulti> yeah that sort of response AlexDaniel is messed up

[11:55] <Ulti> why would anyone give a crap about the gamification side of SO??

[11:56] <Ulti> do you get cash at some level -____- have I been doing this wrong

[11:56] *** kid51 joined
[11:57] <AlexDaniel> I kinda like that the attribution is less prominent on Wikipedia. This way there's no gamification at all. Well, almost

[11:58] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: well, you don't get cash, no. But some say that it may play a role when you apply for a new job

[11:59] <Ulti> not in any role I have ever come across

[11:59] <Ulti> I would never think to check someones SO account, perhaps their GitHub

[12:00] <Ulti> plus what would it indicate, you are good in a user support role?

[12:00] <cygx> note that stackoverflow provides its own 'jobs' portal

[12:00] <Ulti> yeah I guess I dont shop for pure software jobs

[12:01] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: some might argue that it means that you know shit, which is probably a fair assumption

[12:01] <Ulti> my citation record of actual published papers tends to be more important than stack overflow karma... but is essentially the exact same metric

[12:10] <gfldex> i would like to point out that wikipedia is maintained by donations. Stackoverflow is maintained by a privately owned company via selling ads. If I would have scrolled all the way down I could have read that information in a line of text that is 1.8mm small on my screen. If I would have done so I would have known what to expect. My own bloody fault, right?

[12:14] <troyT`> hi

[12:15] <AlexDaniel> troyT`: hello

[12:15] <troyT`> I was wondering if anybody else has trouble installing rakudo

[12:15] <troyT`> I tried to do it but it doesn't work

[12:15] <gfldex> that happens at times. can you provide more infomration of your troubles?

[12:16] <troyT`> I followed the guide on http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/#Installing-Rakudo-Star-Source-Rakudobrew

[12:16] <troyT`> I am using Ubuntu 16.04

[12:16] <troyT`> I could build moar

[12:16] *** canopus left
[12:16] <troyT`> and I can run basic perl6

[12:17] <troyT`> but I can't get panda to work

[12:17] *** TEttinger left
[12:17] <gfldex> please try `rakudobrew build zef`

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> troyT`: what abou ｢rakudobrew build panda｣ ?

[12:17] <AlexDaniel> or that, yes

[12:18] <gfldex> zef will likely replace panda in the next release

[12:18] <troyT`> oh, I see

[12:18] <troyT`> I am not really up to date on these things

[12:18] <troyT`> so panda indicated that it is installing File::Find

[12:18] <troyT`> but nothing else then

[12:19] <troyT`> only the 'please make sure' stuff

[12:19] <troyT`> and I don't have panda in the indicated location

[12:19] <troyT`> whre can I read about zef?

[12:20] <gfldex> https://github.com/ugexe/zef

[12:20] <troyT`> thanks

[12:21] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: well, when I was joining stackoverflow I was aware of all that stuff, but at the time I did not realize that it is not something I want to be part of. And I'm not sure what is worse, that or not knowing something… it feels bad anyway :)

[12:22] <troyT`> I tried zef but it errors out :-/

[12:24] <AlexDaniel> troyT`: can you upload the log somewhere so that we can take a look?

[12:24] *** TEttinger joined

[12:28] <gfldex> troyT`: did you install rakudo before?

[12:28] <troyT`> no, I haven't

[12:28] <troyT`> I uploaded the log pastebin

[13:48] <smls> the handling of broken symlinks in Perl 6 is kinda broken, as that reddit user already discovered

[13:49] <smls> Did I say something wrong?

[13:49] <lizmat> smls: no, this just touched on a sore spot with me

[13:49] <lizmat> smls: nothing you said or done  :-)

[13:49] <smls> ok

[13:50] <smls> Is it because this is the kind of stuff that your newio branch fixed, which wasn't merged because the Perl 6.c release was kinda rushed?

[13:50] *** rburkholder left
[13:50] <lizmat> well, my feeling is that it was more that nobody was interested at the time

[13:50] <lizmat> especially on the @LARRY front  :-(

[13:51] <lizmat> so the branch got bitrotted in the GLR and other refactors

[13:51] <lizmat> and by that time the -Ofun factor had gone below zero for me

[13:51] <geekosaur> trainwreck :(

[13:53] *** AlexDaniel joined
[13:53] <MasterDuke> speaking of @LARRY and IO::Path.resolve, my old PR https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/775 has the "pending user" tag, but i think it's really waiting on an @LARRY decision

[13:54] <MasterDuke> should that be added to RT #128214, or does it not need that level of decision?

[14:00] <mst> lizmat: there was a fair amount of carnage in the lead up to the release, and it sucked for various people, but ... managing to get to release I think in the long run will've been worth it

[20:14] <moritz> searching perldoc (p5) for "negative lookbehind" usually leaves you baffled by the limitation it imposes

[20:34] <BenGoldberg> Here's what I've got so far:

[20:39] <timotimo> but yeah, you don't get k and v with just :delete, so you don't get the values you want

[21:00] <BenGoldberg> Anyway, I'm 90% certain that the problem is not due to '($foo, $bar) = whatever'

[21:00] <tailgate>  is zip-latest a lazy version of zip?

[21:01] <timotimo> not quite

[21:01] <timotimo> zip-latest doesn't require all supplies involved to emit the same amount fo things

[21:01] <timotimo> it'll emit a new tuple whenever one of the incoming supplies changes

[21:02] <timotimo> rather than waiting for every supply to emit the nth value to put into the nth outgoing tuple

[21:02] <timotimo> BBIAB

[21:02] <tailgate> ah, I see.

[21:03] *** andrzejku left
[21:05] <tailgate> is zip by itself lazy? looking at the implemenation in infix Z from List.pm, it uses a gather/take block

[21:54] <El_Che> Hi, a NativeCall question. If i need to pass a pointer to a pointer to a nativecall function, how do create a pointer-to-a-pointer in the calling perl6 code? In the nativecall part I created this: a C Pointer class: class LibLDAP::Native::LDAP is repr('CPointer') { }  

[21:54] <El_Che> and this is the function in question: sub ldap_initialize(Pointer[LibLDAP::Native::LDAP], Str) returns int32 is native(l,v) is export { * }

[21:54] <El_Che> all the other 'C-perl6 bridged' functions work fine as they just require a pointer

[21:56] <El_Che> (this is an example of a function that works fine (the returned pointer can be passed to other function anddo the correct stuff): sub ldap_init(Str, int32) returns LibLDAP::Native::LDAP is native(l,v) is export { * }

[22:55] <dataangel> Does Perl 6 have something like python's pickle module? (Automatically serializes most arbitrary objects)

[22:58] <ugexe> nqp::serialize, but i'm only half serious 

[22:59] <dataangel> ugexe: is it similar but has some horrible limitation or...?

[23:09] <dataangel> I see a module I want to use on modules.perl6.org but I'm not sure how. I don't appear to have panda installed, and the github page for panda says I need rakudobrew which I don't appear to have either. Should I just build both from source? Why are there two applications for downloading modules and why does one require the other?

[23:12] <sena_kun> dataangel, rakudobrew is a general script to install rakudo/panda. For example, I don't want to install rakudo every time manually, so I use rakudobrew to automate this process. How did you get rakudo, firstly? Do you use Rakudo Star package or built it by hands?

[23:12] <ugexe> where does pandas github say you need rakudobrew?

[23:13] <ugexe> it says rakudobrew is the most common way, and then lists the instructions on manual installation

[23:13] *** bjz left
[23:13] <dataangel> Well I figured I should be doing it the common way is, I mis- paraphrased

[23:15] <ugexe> i was confused because you asked why one required the other, which you seem to understand is not true

[23:15] <dataangel> sena_kun: I built it by hand 

[23:15] <dataangel> I mistakenly thought they were both doing the same thing as panda

[23:19] *** dwarring joined
[23:19] <sena_kun> dataangel, nope. Building by hands is not really cool, so you can 1)use Rakudo Star distribution which has many packages pre-installed and rakudo built; 2)use rakudobrew to build rakudo and panda to install modules. The first way should be more "user-friendly", but I've never used it, so I can't help you Rakudo Star, sorry. Rakudobrew, though, is a quite handy thing to make things work.

[23:23] <timotimo> interesting. i didn't know we allow whitespace there

[23:25] <dataangel> What is the difference between need and use? Documentation says that use also does an import at compile time... So does that mean I only need to worry about the distinction if I'm doing meta-programming using the module I'm needing/using?

[23:26] <ugexe> rakudobrew could add a command that just acts as a front end to an uninstalled copy of zef to work across all installations, which would then get precompiled for whatever rakudo version when it gets run
