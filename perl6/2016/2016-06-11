[05:42] <RabidGravy> normally if I'm awake at this time on a Saturday, the cat is to blame, this morning it is the neighbours "repairing" something with a large hammer

[05:43] <sortiz> grrr!

[05:45] <RabidGravy> sortiz, just the man,!

[05:46] <RabidGravy> (as you know just about as much about DBIsh as anyone right now)

[05:47] *** kurahaupo joined
[05:47] <RabidGravy> is there any support for one or both of "columns" type binding or binding "array datatypes" ?

[05:47] <sortiz> RabidGravy, right now I'm hacking on FROGGS's XML::LibXML :-)

[05:48] <RabidGravy> that is in the first case column name => $value pairs, and the second passing a list as a bind value

[05:49] <RabidGravy> also (hacking on FROGGS's XML::LibXML)++  # top job

[05:49] <RabidGravy> the existing XML library works quite well, but really slOooooOOooow

[05:50] <sortiz> Only PostgreSQL has support for Array datatypes.

[05:50] *** mr-foobar left
[05:51] <RabidGravy> okay, so probably *do* want to support generating SQL and bind values for that in "the thing that sorta does what SQL::Abstract does" I'm working on at the moment

[05:53] <konobi> RabidGravy: had a look at postgres's FDW functionality at all?

[05:53] <sortiz> I should see that SQL::Abstract module.

[05:54] <RabidGravy> I don't even know what FDW functionality is in the general case ;-)

[05:55] <konobi> Foreign Data Wrappers

[05:56] <RabidGravy> sortiz, the WIP is https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Squirrel but very rough at the moment

[05:56] <konobi> https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers

[05:57] <RabidGravy> it started off as an experiment to see how easy it would be to brute force port the module and then I got all obstinate

[05:58] <RabidGravy> konobi, so a bit like remotes or whatever they are called in SQL Server or Oracle

[05:58] <RabidGravy> I've done that stuff in both of the above

[06:00] <konobi> but you can also use it to interact with the db on a more reflective level

[06:45] <sortiz> RabidGravy, I dunno if a pure-abstract approach worth the effort, but right now DBDish::Pg can do some introspection in the DB, via $dbh.table-info and $dbh.column-info, allowing you to validate the column names and allowed types.

[06:45] *** CIAvash joined
[06:46] <CIAvash> o/

[06:47] <RabidGravy> Oh that part is up to some other piece of software, the sql abstraction is a completely separate pre-requisite for a whole class of other modules

[06:47] <sortiz> Btw, the SQL quote style used by identifiers vary from one engine to another.

[06:48] <RabidGravy> yes

[06:49] <RabidGravy> (having worked with nearly every database engine known I know this too well)

[06:50] <RabidGravy> however again, that is the responsibility of another piece of software

[06:50] <RabidGravy> I just haven't implemented the quoting part there properly yet

[13:11] <Zoffix> tbrowder, would you think I'm a total dick were I to revert this? https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/585  tbrowder, there are actually several bugs with that subroutine and it's unpollished. There were several attempts to fix it but they kinda drowned in decision paralysis. I finally wrote down a plan for what it's supposed to work like and Larry gave me a plausible excuse to at least submit a PR. With the documentation and tests lacking for the 

[13:11] <Zoffix> "extra" functionality, it'd be easier to bikeshed what the sub should do, which is why I want to exclude it from the docs for now, lest someone actually uses it. Lastly, the rel/abs tol version in your docs is incorrect. Those are named args, not positionals.

[14:39] <dogbert17> teatime: well, you're not missing much atm anyway (watches Switzerland - Albania with one eye)

[14:40] <timotimo> i find soccer rather boring

[14:40] <timotimo> and the infatuation the rest of the germans have with soccer makes me even more fierce in my anti-soccer stance

[14:41] <teatime> I was listening to NPR today, and they had a bit where they described the German practice of setting up outdoor TVs (in like, every neighborhood, apparently), and they all come out and drink beer and watch the Germany matches.

[14:41] <teatime> that sounds like a lot of fun.

[14:41] <mst> "soccer"

[14:41] <timotimo> until you realize you'll be with soccer fans at those things :)

[14:41] <teatime> haha

[14:43] <timotimo> handball

[14:43] <timotimo> that's pretty cool

[14:43] <teatime> is that similar to raquetball or squash?

[14:43] <timotimo> it doesn't feature anything like raquets

[14:44] <teatime> oh, well I guess I could have deduced that from the name.

[14:44] <timotimo> it consists of the ball beind held in your hands

[14:44] <timotimo> much like in football where you hold the ball with your feet, clearly

[14:44] <teatime> raquetball/squash is about my favorite cardio workout

[14:44] <timotimo> also, bball isn't bad

[14:44] <teatime> so much more entertaining than e.g. running

[14:44] <timotimo> in general, i think i prefer games where the scoring system results in somewhat big numbers, rather than single-digit numbers :)

[14:45] <timotimo> there's much more back-and-forth that way

[14:45] <timotimo> on the other hand, i don't get baseball at all

[14:45] <teatime> heh, any specific questions?

[14:46] <timotimo> oh. i don't mean it in the "understand" way, but the other "understand" way

[14:46] <teatime> baseball is v. boring to watch imo

[14:46] <teatime> kindof like golf

[14:47] <mst> running is boring. football is fun if you're bad at it, but once people get good at it the scores go down and I get bored

[14:47] <mst> playing football for the fun of it with a bunch of other people who aren't that good is fun, watching competente people not so much

[14:47] <mst> the only sports I actually *liked* playing were rounders and rugby though

[14:47] <AlexDaniel> yea, especially when they're paid for it :D

[14:47] <timotimo> i don't know what rounders is :)

[14:48] <teatime> can we count pool as a sport?  or auto racing.  those are the only two I ever got into seriously.

[14:48] <mst> baseball family

[14:48] <mst> I don't particularly like watching it either though

[14:48] <timotimo> my dad's big into formula 1

[14:48] <mst> teatime: I was running with the cardio theme, but I think we can for the watching question

[14:49] <teatime> I meant playing.  I don't really watch pool or racing.

[14:49] <mst> to watch, badminton's good

[14:49] <mst> I play the occasional game against friends on a pub's pool team

[14:49] <timotimo> i never played badminton regularly, so never got any good at it at all

[14:49] <mst> actually, I used to quite like watching snooker while thinking about stuff

[14:52] <mst> yeah, if I watch pool, it's because I happen to be bored in a pub where their team's playing a match

[14:54] <dogbert17> that can be fun

[14:56] <timotimo> it usually requires you to know the game in question a bit, though. maybe more so than soccer would

[14:59] <dogbert17> btw, I have a new boring doc gist for Baggy.roll here: https://gist.github.com/dogbert17/cb137b3fa751b853bda38f5750540ce0

[17:35] <Zoffix> .oO( was that ever a goal...? )

[17:36] <geekosaur> it's a fiuture goal, I don't think anything has actually been done yet though

[17:36] <ruoso> well, if I wanted to write a web app on rakudo-j, I better implement the servlet interface

[17:37] *** yqt joined

[17:48] <ruoso> ah, thanks... let me take a look

[17:48] <TimToady> m: class A { method sink() { print "sunk " } }; my @a = gather for ^10 { take A.new }; say @a[0]

[17:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 915f45: OUTPUT«A.new␤»

[17:49] <TimToady> m: class A { method sink() { print "sunk " } }; my @a = gather for ^10 { (take A.new).sink }; say @a[0]

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 915f45: OUTPUT«sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk A.new␤»

[17:49] <TimToady> something must be annotating take with :nosink or so

[17:49] <AlexDaniel> moritz: hi! What are you concerns about https://github.com/perl6/doc/pull/573 exactly?

[17:49] <TimToady> m: class A { method sink() { print "sunk " } }; my @a = gather for ^10 { take A.new; 42 }; say @a[0]

[17:49] <camelia> rakudo-moar 915f45: OUTPUT«WARNINGS for <tmp>:␤Useless use of constant integer 42 in sink context (line 1)␤sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk A.new␤»

[17:50] <TimToady> no, it's just failing to propagate the sink on the for into the block

[17:51] <TimToady> strainge that it knows the 42 is in sink context, but not a take by itself

[17:51] <TimToady> *ange

[17:51] <ruoso> pmurias: I guess it no longer works, the test dies right away

[17:51] <AlexDaniel> moritz: I mean, your comment sounded very scary, but the patch itself is really harmless. Am I missing something?

[17:52] <TimToady> m: class A { method sink() { print "sunk " } }; my @a = gather for ^10 { take A.new; take 42 }; say @a[0]

[17:52] <camelia> rakudo-moar 915f45: OUTPUT«sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk sunk A.new␤»

[17:52] <TimToady> so yes, it's a problem with take as well

[17:56] <AlexDaniel> timeless++

[17:57] <TimToady> lizmat: I'm thinking that push and take should not, by default, "dup" values, and that maybe we should have explicit variants for that behavior

[17:57] <lizmat> TimToady: looks like take returning its parameters, is intentional:

[17:57] <lizmat> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/control.pm#L72

[17:57] <TimToady> yes, it was intentionally designed that way, but from a performance standpoint it looks like a botch

[17:58] <lizmat> ok, I'll see what breaks with take returning Nil

[17:58] *** cognominal joined
[17:58] <TimToady> unless we can come up with some way of efficiently returning provisional values that are simply thrown away instead of sunk

[17:59] <TimToady> but that probably entails knowing things at compile time that we can't know

[17:59] <TimToady> especially with late-bound methods

[17:59] <TimToady> (like .push)

[17:59] <lizmat> yup  :-(

[18:00] <TimToady> so I think we have to change the default on push and take, and possibly break some code down the road

[18:02] <lizmat> perhaps that's something we want to do in 6.d ?

[18:02] <TimToady> nodnod

[18:03] <TimToady> till then, maybe an explicit nosink contextualizer that we can put on hotspots
