[01:54] <seatek> is it really?

[02:19] <Herby_> is there an appreciable difference between:  %data = $parser.get_line();    and %data = %($parser.get_line());

[02:19] <Herby_> ?

[02:23] *** cyphase joined
[02:25] <seatek> Herby_, is that that CSV parser?

[02:26] <Herby_> yeah. pulled it from CSV::Parser github

[02:26] <seatek> because if it is I think I remember it saying that if you told it to do a named column something (like I remember seen you did) then it would create hashes on that routine.

[02:26] <seatek> instead of just a list

[02:27] <seatek> but my memory may be damaged

[02:27] <Herby_> hmm

[02:27] <seatek> try it and see!

[02:28] <Herby_> there was no appreciable difference that I could see

[02:28] <Herby_> but its always possible that i'm missing something

[02:29] <seatek> if get_line() is returning a hash already (which I think I remember reading yesterday, saying it would) then you don't need to make it into a hash again.

[02:30] *** cyphase left
[02:30] <seatek> if it's working still as before, that' sprobabaly what it's doing and  you're fine

[02:30] <seatek> i would think

[03:09] <Lucas_One> Hi all

[03:09] <Lucas_One> what is extension correct of Perl 6?

[03:09] <Lucas_One> .pl6 or p6

[03:12] <Lucas_One> here .p6: https://docs.perl6.org/language/modules

[03:13] <Lucas_One> here .pl6: http://perl6intro.com/#_running_perl_6_code

[03:15] <b2gills> I usually use .p6

[03:18] <Herby_> hello!

[03:18] <Herby_> I'm now using .p6 too

[03:19] *** sufrostico left
[03:19] *** skids left
[03:19] <Lucas_One> understand

[03:20] * p3rln00b likes to use .blah

[03:20] <Lucas_One> Visual Studio Code is .p6

[03:20] <BenGoldberg> You don't actually need an extension, you know.

[03:20] <Lucas_One> yes

[03:21] <p3rln00b> Lucas_One: there's no real "correct" answer. You can run perl6 some-script with whatever exception you like. And on Linux, the shebang dictates what program executes the script, not extention. So it comes down to Windows, and there's probably a way to get it to use whatever as well

[03:21] <p3rln00b> s/exception/extension/;

[03:21] <p3rln00b> For modules, use .pm6

[03:22] <BenGoldberg> The more important thing is that (A) you name your files so you know what they are, and (ii) you name your files so your editor/ide knows what they are and syntax highlights / indents correctly.

[03:24] <Lucas_One> thanks

[10:47] <RabidGravy> erp

[10:48] <RabidGravy> haha, the perils of testing against a live MQ broker

[10:48] <RabidGravy> # expected: 'Hello, World'

[10:48] <RabidGravy> #      got: 'Hello World!'

[10:49] <jnthn> The broker makes things more exciting? :P

[10:50] <pmurias> RabidGravy: the broker is mangling your data?

[10:51] <lambd0x> Want to know the right way to measure time spent by a code snippet?

[10:51] <RabidGravy> No, the test worked fine the next time

[10:52] <RabidGravy> I guess there was already a queue called "hello" with the slightly different message on it

[11:01] <psch> lambd0x: what were you looking for anyway?

[11:09] <lambd0x> psch: I was looking for a proper way to measure time spent by a code snippet

[11:09] <jnthn> I'm guessing if you're working on Net::AMQP you decided not to do the STOMP thing for accessing ActiveMQ?

[11:09] <psch> lambd0x: well, best take the suggestion by jnthn++ :)

[11:10] <RabidGravy> jnthn, no, no, it's just I've been tending it for the last while and I thought it was time for a test :)

[12:53] <p3rln00b> ^ that doesn't seems to be the answer.

[12:54] <psch> well if you're rethrowing the CX::Warn...

[12:54] <p3rln00b> Well, I'm just out of ideas :)

[12:54] <psch> anyway, what does "refering foo" mean there?

[12:55] <psch> don't invoke it because it will only warn..?

[12:55] <p3rln00b> Mentioning sub foo in the output

[12:55] <tadzik> you probably want is hidden_from_backtrace

[12:56] <tadzik>     pun indented

[12:56] <timotimo> oh rusty

[12:57] <psch> so, yeah, if you don't want warnings from a given sub to mention that specific sub in their output, you trait it with hidden-from-backtrace

[12:58] <psch> rethrowing a CATCH/CX::Warn block means you're starting a new Backtrace in that CATCH block

[12:59] <p3rln00b> I'm gonna try the rethrowing thing

[12:59] <timotimo> huh? why is that not an option?

[12:59] <p3rln00b> Perl6/Actions.

[12:59] <timotimo> oh

[12:59] <timotimo> you can probably mix in a role with the same method that signals it

[13:00] <psch> well, it's not actually rethrowing :/

[13:00] <psch> i misspoke

[13:01] <psch> it's just a new &warn call with the existing CX::Warn, which i think only takes the payload/message..?

[13:02] <psch> p3rln00b: did you try $*W.apply_trait(...)?

[13:02] <psch> not sure if that runs at the right moment for a sub declared in Actions

[13:03] <psch> alternative the mixin should work -- it really only needs a method is-hidden-from-backtrace that returns something truthy i suppose

[13:07] * p3rln00b tries something entirely different :}

[17:30] <timotimo> to be fair, a pure-perl6 xml parser is quite likely a few orders of magnitude slower than any regular xml parser library you can find for C or something

[21:23] <DrForr> El_Che: No, I renamed it to Perl6::Parser in order to emphasize the fact that it's "just" the parser layer. Other tools need to be built on top of that to achieve that goal, and while I am going to get there, you can look at the code and see that it's going to take a while to tweeze yak hairs off this particular project.

[23:53] <Herby_> i'm trying to grab all CSV files in a folder, using:  my @csv-files = './'.IO.dir(test => / '.csv' /)>>.Str

[23:54] <Herby_> that gives me the CSV files, but they look like "./\test_file.csv"

[23:54] *** cdg_ left
[23:54] *** Matias[m] joined
[23:54] <Herby_> is there a way to grab just the file names, or do i have to manually scrub off the leading "./\"

[23:54] <Herby_> following the example found here: https://docs.perl6.org/routine/dir

[23:54] *** M-Illandan joined
[23:55] <timotimo> if you just want the filename, maybe basename is what you need?

[23:55] <timotimo> m: say "./whatthefile.csv".IO.basename

[23:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2cd7a: OUTPUT«whatthefile.csv␤»

[23:55] <timotimo> m: say "./whatthefile.csv".basename

[23:55] <camelia> rakudo-moar e2cd7a: OUTPUT«No such method 'basename' for invocant of type 'Str'␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[23:55] <timotimo> needs the .IO, so put it before the .Str instead of adding a .IO

[23:55] *** khw left
[23:55] <timotimo> because you already get IOs out of dir, if i remember correctly

[23:57] <Herby_> thats why they pay you the big bucks :)

[23:57] <Herby_> that worked, thanks
