[00:00] <geekosaur> perl 5 doesn't have true global variables either.

[00:01] <pmurias> what are "true" global variables?

[00:01] <RabidGravy> there are variables that can aooear to be glocal

[00:01] <geekosaur> the special-character variables are special cased; anything else not "my" is a package variable (with "our" creating both a package variable and a lexical alias for it)

[00:03] <RabidGravy> m: package FF { PROCESS::<$FOO> = "bar" }; say $*FOO;

[00:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 702186: OUTPUT«bar␤»

[00:03] <kcodrgkimd> Ok Im back, so when I generate a list like so `my $somelist = (1, 2, &foo ... ^ * > 100)` where `sub foo($x) { $x²}` it will advance the sequence by squaring the same number. Is it possible to define a "step" here, like +1, so that it will square 1,2,3,4,5.. etc. ? Sorry for my bad vocabulary.

[00:03] *** lukaramu left
[00:03] <RabidGravy> but you don't want to do that

[00:03] <geekosaur> pmurias, neither lexical nor constrained by a namespace (package in p5 or p6). p6 has a hierarchy of scopes instead, and in theory you could treat the outermost (or outermost few) as "global"

[00:05] <loveperl> If I have a variable in another file, how can I reference it?

[00:05] <RabidGravy> too vague

[00:06] <RabidGravy> you can't reference a 'my' variable at all

[00:07] <RabidGravy> an 'our' variable you can reference fully qualified by package

[00:07] <RabidGravy> or dynamic variables like $*FOO which are by, er, dynamic scope

[00:09] <RabidGravy> read more of https://docs.perl6.org/language.html

[01:40] <hank> Hi I'm totally new to perl and perl6. Would someone be willing to review some code I wrote? It's 50 lines and uses a grammar and action object to parse and evaluate simple math expressions. Tips or style comments would be great. I'm not sure if I'm using action objects idiomatically. Thanks. http://pastebin.com/p8702D7J

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> there are tiny things that can be improved, probably, but I see no significant problems

[01:45] <AlexDaniel> I did not really look at actions thought :)

[01:46] <hank> AlexDaniel: Thanks! Is there a way I can reduce the code duplication in lines 30-41?

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> not really

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> m: my %h = ‘+’ => &[+], ‘-’ => &[-]; say (25, 30, 50).reduce(%h<+>)

[01:48] <AlexDaniel> you can do something like this, but honestly it will just make it harder to read

[01:49] <TimToady> I'd make those single-line blocks, so the whole thing is just 4 lines

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> hank: one thing I tend to do is $<smth>».made

[01:49] <AlexDaniel> not sure if there are any pitfalls associated with this, hmm…

[01:50] <hank> What are those >> things called?

[01:50] <TimToady> the other thing is that it looks like you don't allow spaces after an operator, since there isn't space in the rule after <op()> but before }

[01:50] <TimToady> hypers

[01:50] <TimToady> seems strange to allow spaces after terms but not after operators

[01:51] <hank> Okay I see, I found the documentation on them

[01:52] <hank> Hmm, so I would add \s* after <op()> to allow whitespace?

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> hank: perhaps make exp a multi method

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> <.ws> probably

[01:52] <TimToady> it's in a rule, just add a normal space and it implies <.ws>

[01:52] <AlexDaniel> ah, right

[01:52] <TimToady> change <>} to <> }

[01:53] <hank> So if there's a space between tokens in a rule, they'll skip over whitespace when matching?

[01:53] <TimToady> nice use of parameterized subrules

[01:53] <hank> Yeah I stole that from the Grammar tutorial and modified it

[01:53] <TimToady> more specifically, space after any matching token

[01:53] <hank> That's nifty

[01:53] <TimToady> oh, if you want to allow space at the start, make your TOP a rule too, so that ^ looks for ws after it

[01:54] *** labster joined
[01:54] <TimToady> so inital space doesn't count, but the space after ^ would (if it were a rule)

[01:54] <hank> Ah yes

[01:54] <TimToady> since ^ is the first match

[01:54] <hank> I see

[01:54] <TimToady> the $ is somewhat unnecessary though, since .parse enforces that anyway

[01:55] <TimToady> (and you're not relying on backtracking)

[01:55] <hank> Okay, yeah, good to know

[01:55] <TimToady> (to not enforce that, you'd use subparse instead)

[01:55] <AlexDaniel> if I recall correctly it doesn't matter nowadays

[01:55] <TimToady> the reason it's only ws after a matcher is that otherwise we can't actually do longest token matching on alternations

[01:56] <TimToady> 'cuz half the tokens would start with \s* or so :)

[01:56] <TimToady> so it's only trailing spaces that are auto-eaten

[01:56] *** dataf3l left
[01:57] <hank> AlexDaniel: you said I could make exp a multimethod? How would I get it to pattern match on my conditions properly?

[01:57] *** dataf3l joined
[02:00] <AlexDaniel> hank: ($/ where { not $<exp> }), ($/ where { $<exp> and $<exp>.elems <= 1 }), and another one without where. Probably. Not sure if it will be significantly better this way, but at least you'd get rid of returns :)

[02:01] *** kcodrgkimd left
[02:01] <hank> So a where inside the parenthesis where the arguments go will do dynamic dispatch?

[02:01] <AlexDaniel> yea

[02:01] <hank> Okay, cool, I'm gonna try that

[02:02] <hank> So many features in perl6 :^)

[02:02] <AlexDaniel> hank: also, it seems like you're trying to calculate the result right away. I'm not sure what your final goal is, but perhaps you want to generate an AST?

[02:03] *** pyrimidine joined
[02:03] <hank> My eventual goal is to implement the 24 game (and a 24 game solver to ensure winning is always possible). I don't think I need an AST, but how would I make a tree structure in perl6? Nested hashes?

[02:04] <hank> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game

[02:05] <AlexDaniel> hank: That would be a bit messy. I'd create a couple of classes

[02:06] <hank> So an AST class that contains children which are also ASTs?

[08:35] <samcv> could probably be a bit more elegant but i'm just impressed i actually got it working tbh

[08:36] <nige1> nice

[08:36] <samcv> doing foreground _and_ background colors ....

[08:36] <samcv> and dealing with the asci codes... some have leading zeros

[08:36] <samcv> for the numbers

[08:36] <nige1> it looks like it preserves colours - in this case I wanna strip away the colour creating codes

[08:36] <samcv> there's a module for that

[08:37] <samcv> or you could do it yourself

[08:37] <samcv> nige1, so you don't care about preserving state?

[08:37] <samcv> just want to get rid of it?

[08:38] <nige1> yes 

[08:38] <nige1> for example the program .... say "hello" say "world";

[08:38] <nige1> there is a missing ; there

[08:39] <nige1> perl6 will helpfully point out the location - and some of the console output is 'marked up' with highlighting colours

[08:39] <nige1> (normally I like this - just need it in plain text though on this occasion)

[08:40] <samcv> 	my $escape = "\e[";

[08:40] <samcv> 	my $end = 'm';

[08:40] <samcv> and then between the $escape and $end is a number

[08:40] <samcv> 0-9

[08:40] <samcv> the \e in the "" will interpolate to the escape control code

[08:41] <samcv> $string ~~ s:g/$escape\d+?$end//;

[08:41] <samcv> that should probably do the trick

[08:45] <nige1> thanks - much appreciated

[08:45] <samcv> no problem :)

[08:46] <samcv> can there be more than one advent per day?

[08:46] <samcv> or is that not allowed ;P

[08:47] <lizmat> I think traditionally, there's only 1 per day

[08:47] <lizmat> and since this is a tradition  :-)

[08:47] <samcv> could we extend into the new year? or more than one a day?

[08:47] <samcv> whatever people think is good.

[08:47] <lizmat> samcv: if you have a blog post, I will mention it in the next P6W, just like the advents ?

[08:47] <samcv> i don't yet

[08:48] <lizmat> well, I would be all for infinite advent, with one blog post per day until the end of time

[08:48] <nige1> would be happy to link to said post from the advent entry if it relates

[08:49] <lizmat> but I'm afraid we will run out of posters / subjects in a year or 3  :-)

[08:49] <samcv> hah

[08:49] <samcv> i could probably make something about unicode properties and other things such as that. and the syntax highlighter isn't exactly perl 6 so doesn't really fit. or could make something else up

[08:51] <samcv> can we do regex matches for unicode properties other than general category btw?

[08:51] <samcv> in perl apparently you can do \p{Script=Hebrew}

[08:51] <samcv> and it wil match the requested property

[08:52] <lizmat> samcv: you can add any piece of code as a matcher, afaik

[08:53] <samcv> ok i think i found it. going through the synopsis

[08:55] <samcv> yeah that's what i thought you could do, i just haven't used it before. but i should tbh

[09:19] <samcv> yeah that's what i thought they were

[09:20] *** rurban joined
[09:21] <toolforger> Yeah, sticking with a category is much less maintenance-intense

[09:21] <samcv> yeah

[09:21] *** RabidGravy joined
[09:21] <samcv> i actually made a test to locate every Ps/Pe or Pi/Pf character. and that's how i discovered that… the ornate parens

[09:22] <samcv> 'problem'

[09:22] *** nige1 left
[09:22] <samcv> and also added the missing parens we didn't have to NQP project. so hopefully we can just remove those

[09:22] <toolforger> I wouldn't expect more problems like that to pop up in the future, so adding some extra code for that would be okay in my book

[09:23] <samcv> but the left ornate paren looks like a left paren but is the closing symbol

[09:23] <toolforger> Well, that's confusables

[09:23] <samcv> it was originally a RTL codepoint, but it's not a poir and doesn't reverse

[09:23] <samcv> exactly

[09:23] <samcv> it's just one clusterfuck

[09:23] <samcv> and most text editors don't even render it correctly

[09:23] <toolforger> To deal with confusables, you need to have a programmer-friendly font

[09:24] <samcv> they're basically terrible and should never be used ;)

[09:24] <toolforger> so it's not just editors

[09:24] <samcv> well toolforger 

[09:24] <samcv> they're literally reversed

[09:24] <samcv> but don't mirror differently in LTR or RTL text

[09:24] <samcv> so it just is horrible

[09:25] <samcv> everything else is fine though ;)

[09:25] <samcv> i wonder if i can just search github for any perl files using those files cause there probably is just roast

[09:25] <toolforger> Issue here is that we need somebody with Arabic knowledge to see how they deal with it

[09:25] <samcv> they don't use them

[09:26] <samcv> they just use normal parens, which just conform to the direction of the text they contain

[09:26] <samcv> no matter if they type latin things or RTL text

[09:27] <toolforger> Well, *somebody* was using them, else they wouldn't be in Unicode

[09:27] <samcv> yeah. somebody. and only for RTL text not mixed

[09:27] <samcv> also fyi. numbers inside RTL text are rendered LTR

[09:27] <toolforger> I never looked into bidi rule details

[09:28] * toolforger values his sanity

[09:28] <samcv> yeah i've been making lots of fixes to the rakudo .uniprop and implemented .uniprops method/routine just this last month

[09:28] <samcv> and been adding tons of tests to roasts for it.

[09:28] <toolforger> I can imagine

[09:28] <samcv> it starts out really crazy. but. it's becoming less hard as time goes on

[09:28] <samcv> (which is a good thing)

[09:28] <toolforger> I know

[09:29] <toolforger> I tackled pluralization

[09:29] <samcv> pluralization?

[09:29] <toolforger> http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules

[09:30] <samcv> :)

[09:30] <toolforger> And this: http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/29/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html

[09:30] <toolforger> Particularly http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/29/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#comparison if you want to impress people with how many special cases there are

[09:31] <toolforger> Human language is just crazy...

[09:31] <samcv> good thing unicode exists though

[09:31] <samcv> otherwise it would be way harder

[09:31] <toolforger> Nobody would even try getting it right

[09:31] <samcv> well would only get it right for one language ;)

[09:32] <toolforger> on the plus side, all languages would converge towards what programmers would do

[09:32] <samcv> they already sort of have though

[09:33] <toolforger> Well, many would consider that a minus, so... ;-)

[09:33] <samcv> asian languages are usually written LTR now

[09:33] <samcv> instead of top to bottom right to left

[09:33] <toolforger> Oh

[09:33] <samcv> mostly, i mean they used to be a lot of possible directions

[09:33] <toolforger> I thought it's been top-down left-right

[09:33] <samcv> but mostly was top to bottom right to left

[09:33] <toolforger> ah

[09:33] <toolforger> right

[09:33] <samcv> well a lot of languages didn't have a strict direction to write them

[09:34] <toolforger> I bet some lyrics was using unusual directions to express subtext

[09:34] <samcv> some even older ones would be written mirrored when reversing the directions

[09:34] <samcv> or alternate LTR RTL etc

[09:34] <samcv> every other line

[09:34] <samcv> you could probably read and write faster. but i guess it confused people idk

[09:34] <toolforger> I dimly recall that being used in some ruins around the Mediterranean

[09:34] <samcv> egyptian did it too

[09:35] <toolforger> Most people couldn't read anyway

[09:35] <samcv> well. sometimes. i mean. you would read the direction based on which way the symbols faced

[09:35] <toolforger> In Medieval times, it was generally considered to be impossible to read a text without saying it loud

[09:35] <samcv> why

[09:36] <toolforger> It's a separate technique

[09:36] <toolforger> children still do it today when learning to read

[09:36] <toolforger> silent reading comes later

[09:36] <samcv> hmm

[09:36] <toolforger> and of course you never learn it if you don't know it's possible

[09:36] <samcv> i guess that makes sense

[09:37] <toolforger> besides, loud reading helps ignore spelling variations

[09:37] <toolforger> ther were no orthography committees then

[09:38] <samcv> hm this thing http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9804/ip.html says that no spaces were really used either

[09:38] <toolforger> matches my knowledge

[09:38] <samcv> i saw the Magna Carta a week ago at a museum. can attest. text was tiny af and like

[09:38] <samcv> no spacing

[09:38] <samcv> also really weird script. could only make out like

[09:38] <samcv> 1 letter lol.

[09:39] <RabidGravy> I had a literature tutor who recommended reading old and middle English texts such as Chaucer out aloud in a sort of northern accent, as it made it easier to unerstand

[09:40] <toolforger> More cultural differences in scripts :-)

[09:40] <samcv> ithinkweshouldalljusttypelikethis

[09:40] <samcv> muchbetterthisway

[09:40] <toolforger> that's how I do my passwords

[09:40] <samcv> makeitharderfortheplebianstoreadwhatwearesaying

[09:40] <toolforger> diceware, but why type spaces...

[09:40] <toolforger> heh

[09:40] *** ssm left
[09:40] <toolforger> I just misread "plebian store"

[09:40] <samcv> hah

[09:40] <toolforger> though "dwhat" didn't parse, I had to backtrack

[09:41] <samcv> yeah that plus different spellings would be so annoying

[09:41] <toolforger> I think that's mostly a matter of practice

[09:42] <toolforger> we deal with ambiguous pronounciation in oral communication every day and don't think much about that

[09:42] <samcv>  Clinical tests reveal that the brain processes the reading of spaced text--in which words are essentially digested whole--differently from the syllable-by-syllable decoding of continuous script. In fact, different parts of the brain handle these two tasks: Studies of brain-injured Japanese patients demonstrate that, depending on the site of a cerebral lesion, a person may lose the faculty for reading kanji ideographs, but not Japanese phonetic script, 

[09:42] <samcv> which lacks regular word separation--and vice versa. The implication is that, even if early medieval readers of scriptura continua somehow managed to keep their mouths shut, they were performing a mental task fundamentally different from that of contemporary readers.

[09:42] <samcv> ^ that's really interesting

[09:42] <toolforger> Makes sense

[09:43] <toolforger> Comic reading is pretty different from book reading, too

[09:43] <toolforger> particularly if the comic has little text

[09:44] <toolforger> I'll still stick with the reading mode that I have most practice with :-)

[09:44] *** xfix joined
[09:44] <toolforger> Something entirely different

[09:45] <toolforger> Anybody got ideas about how to best assign packages to NQP-on-JVM classes?

[09:46] <RabidGravy> haven't the faintest

[09:47] <toolforger> Right now everything goes into the root package

[09:47] <toolforger> That's a no-go for Java types

[09:47] <toolforger> Code isn't attributable, and it invites name clashes

[09:48] <samcv> :(

[09:48] <toolforger> so they can't have it

[09:48] <toolforger> NQP could be put into org.perl6.nqp

[09:48] <toolforger> so that's the easy part

[09:49] <toolforger> Not sure about where modules should go

[09:49] <toolforger> the package namespace in Java land is organized along the DNS

[09:52] <RabidGravy> well more along the lines of X500 distinguished names or the thing that ja.net used before the DNS in that particular order :)

[09:53] <toolforger> Nope, it's DNS

[09:53] <toolforger> It's not enforced, so some well-known packages do not adhere to that

[09:53] <RabidGravy> it's the wroong way round for DNS

[09:53] <toolforger> That's just a mechanical change

[09:54] <toolforger> they needed to be hierarchical

[09:55] <toolforger> but the general rule is that if you own foo.com, then you can publish your packages under com.foo.whatever.you.like

[09:57] <toolforger> How do people in Perl land organize their module namespace so there aren't clashes?

[10:00] *** lukaramu joined
[10:00] <RabidGravy> on a functional basis largely, though in P6 the "long name" takes care of the clashes (if people care to use it,)

[10:01] <RabidGravy> an example would be HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response of which there are two  modules that provide those names and can be disambiguated by auth

[10:05] <RabidGravy> right, better start writing this advent post I guess

[10:05] <toolforger> (Backtracking to ornate parentheses) samcv, I fully agree that these shouldn't be made Perl parentheses. Unless the Perl community knows that it can do better than the Unicode Consortium, that is.

[10:06] <samcv> yeah

[10:09] <toolforger> (back to namespace organization) What's a long name? I see it as some grammar-related construct, but that's clearly not a namespace thing for modules

[10:12] <RabidGravy> the long name for a module comprises  the name, version, auth (and theoretically,) the api

[10:12] <RabidGravy> so "Foo:ver<0.1>:auth<someone>"

[10:12] <toolforger> What's the form of an auth?

[10:13] <RabidGravy> I think ugexe's advent post of yesterday explains it

[10:15] <toolforger> Ah, so the "auth" above was meant as a literal

[10:15] *** Vynce left
[10:16] <toolforger> Hmm... so My::Module would map to my.module in the Java world

[10:16] <toolforger> Except that it isn't guaranteed to be free from clashes

[10:17] <RabidGravy> comparing it too directly to java like that is going to get you confused

[10:18] <toolforger> Nah, I'm trying to find out how to best compile Perl to Java

[10:18] <toolforger> s/Java/JVM bytecode/

[10:18] <toolforger> putting everything into the anonymous root package works well enough for Perl code, but it won't do for Perl-Java interop

[10:21] <toolforger> E.g. what's the name to call My::Module->new from Java?

[10:22] *** bjz_ left
[10:23] <toolforger> Java coders would want to say "new My.Module()"

[10:24] <toolforger> which is impractical because potential conflicts in the "My" namespace

[10:27] <toolforger> Hmm... seeing that no good ideas are floating around here, where/when/with whom should I raise this?

[18:27] <RabidGravy> yeah that one bit me the first time I tried to use it

[18:28] <RabidGravy> the best thing to remember is that the regex is a little language of its own and if you want to use anything from the Perl program in it you will generally need to use the braces like that

[18:32] <BenGoldberg> . o O (little?)

[18:32] *** sena_kun left
[18:32] <RabidGravy> well, in the relative sense

[18:34] <RabidGravy> as much as there are people who like to think they can write their whole program in regex, it's definitely just a small part of the whole thing (leaving aside the thing about Perl6 being parsed by its own Grammar,)

[18:35] *** pyrimidine left
[18:45] * geekosaur thinks of it as any other lexical conflict...

[18:46] <geekosaur> if it's not a simple number then it's ambiguous, use braces to disambiguate the count-expression from the rest of the regex

[18:46] <geekosaur> (and yes, with braces it can be a complex expression, not just a variable)
