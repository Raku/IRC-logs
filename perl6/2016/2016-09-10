[08:39] <bioduds> just passing by

[08:39] <bioduds> to say

[08:39] <bioduds> I'm drunk!

[08:39] <bioduds> :)

[08:39] <bioduds> thanks for Perl6

[08:40] * sjn is sober and like Perl6 too :)

[08:41] <sjn> likes*

[08:43] *** mcmillhj left
[08:43] <bioduds> LOL

[08:43] <bioduds> yeah

[08:44] <bioduds> he must

[08:44] <bioduds> Perl6 is so awesome

[08:44] <bioduds> and I'm not saying it cause I'm drunk

[08:46] <bioduds> what time is it there?

[08:46] <bioduds> im in Brazil

[08:47] <bioduds> its 5:46 AM here

[08:47] <bioduds> you in Europe?

[08:50] <w4and0er96> after reading perl6 inter site, I find I still confuse about many pl6 code for their 'magic' ops or grammar, to figure out 'all' those seems meaningless, and  I now still code pl6 in a 'C-like' style. Since I'm a student, where can I find a task that can improve my pl6 coding skill and knowledge?

[08:53] <bioduds> w4and0er96 : currently, youtube p6 principles that the guys who made it are spreading

[08:53] <bioduds> check, for instance why they say that perl6 has Math that really works and why

[08:54] <bioduds> also, check how to make you code fully declarative, a thing perl lets you do

[08:54] <bioduds> also, check how grammars work

[08:54] <bioduds> this may begin to show you the new perl6 programming paradigm

[08:59] <w4and0er96> thx, I'll try it

[09:04] *** FROGGS joined
[09:05] *** eliasr joined
[09:15] <Woodi> w4and0er96: maybe try to write some perl6 script or module you want to write, that provides instant learning. also helps improve language with real world usages :)

[09:19] <stmuk_> yes and exactly what you write matters less than writing sommething

[12:33] <masak> ah, yes.

[12:34] <MasterDuke> does it make sense to remove module from the ecosystem if they've been obsoleted?

[12:34] <MasterDuke> i wrote the hacky List::Combinations because the rakudo builtins were slower, but now they're faster (and lazy if you want)

[12:35] <timotimo> you can deprecate your functions with "is DEPRECATED" iirc

[12:35] <timotimo> iirc it allows you to tell the user what you recommend using instead

[12:36] <MasterDuke> do that, bump the version, then remove entirely after some time has gone by?

[12:38] <timotimo> yeah

[12:38] <timotimo> give it a year or two :P

[12:38] <MasterDuke> ha, i don't think it has all that many users other than me

[12:48] <rightfold> Can I pass a Blob to a native function that takes a Pointer[void]?

[12:50] <rightfold> or CArray[uint8]

[12:51] <rightfold> the documentation says "TBD"

[12:51] *** canopus left
[12:52] <timotimo> you can definitely nativecast a CArray into a Pointer

[12:52] <timotimo> i'm not sure about Blob, though.

[12:54] <rightfold> I suppose I can fill a CArray from a Blob

[12:56] <timotimo> define a binding to memcpy that takes a Blob and a CArray :)

[12:56] <timotimo> actually, you may want to manually memory-manage the thing and use CPointer instead of CArray

[12:56] <timotimo> if all you want to do is pass the thing into a function

[12:57] <timotimo> NativeCall really wants to have a way to pretend an array is a pointer and the other way around

[12:57] <timotimo> that requires some extra care with regards to what kinds of things may have their storage move around in memory.

[12:57] <timotimo> AFK for a bit

[13:26] <w4and0er96> besides reduce using [op], how can I code equivalently like  a.filter(..).reduce(..).filter(..)?

[13:27] *** bjz left
[13:32] <moritz> w4and0er96: filter is called grep

[13:32] <moritz> w4and0er96: reduce is reduce

[13:33] <moritz> though after a reduce, you typically only have one item left, so not much point in having another grep/filter after it

[13:33] *** canopus joined
[13:33] <rightfold> is it at all possible to serve two clients simultaneously using IO::Socket::INET? or do I have to use IO::Socket::Async?

[13:35] <rightfold> because I can't read from a socket that was created in another thread

[13:35] <MasterDuke> pretty sure that's either by design or a known limitation

[13:40] <w4and0er96> moritz: sure, but what if a is array of arrays? at that point I may apply one more grep, although its real world app may rare

[13:43] <perlawhirl> w4and0er96: in most cases i think you're thinking of .map , ie. @AoA.grep( *.elems > 5 ).map( *.sum ).grep( * > 10 );

[13:43] <w4and0er96> moritz:  got it 'reduce is reduce' :) embarrassed

[19:53] <mst> masak: same, and same. I worry that re-reading them might spoil my nostalgic fondness

[19:53] <masak> quite possibly

[19:53] <masak> I also remember enjoying the (BBC?) TV series version, although I know I wouldn't be able to watch it today :)

[19:54] <masak> partly that's due to the inexorable march of special effects, though

[19:54] <geekosaur> you don't like pepper shakers? :p

[19:55] <masak> thought that was Star Trek

[19:55] <mst> I really don't mind ye olde special effects

[19:55] <mst> then again I've also been known to watch plays

[19:56] <geekosaur> daleks, actually

[19:57] <geekosaur> ST had its own levels of that, though, sure. I'm fairly lax about that, picking on something as old as I am for being old seems like bad plan :p

[21:28] <timotimo> hm. this points out to me that we don't have sitemaps for most of our perl6 sites; i'm not sure what exactly they allow you to get, but maybe it'd be good to have them for some of our stuff?

[21:28] <mst> yes! it's like web scale, except useful

[21:29] <timotimo> :D

[21:51] *** labster left
[21:55] *** khw left
[21:56] <dogbert17> the problem could possibly be related to https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/core/Str.pm#L230

[21:56] <timotimo> nah, that's the one that fires when you give it -1

[21:57] <dogbert17> row 223 then :)

[21:58] <timotimo> the error itself probably comes from inside moarvm, actually

[21:58] <dogbert17> m: say "1232".rindex('2',-1)

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b771bc: OUTPUT«Position in rindex out of range. Is: -1, should be in 0..4␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤Actually thrown at:␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[21:58] <timotimo> that one just fires if you use a big integer instead of a normal-sized integer

[21:58] <timotimo> m: my $ex = try { "1232".rindex('2', 100) }; say $ex.WHAT

[21:58] <camelia> rakudo-moar b771bc: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[21:58] <dogbert17> but if there are four chars in the string shouldn't the range be 0..3

[21:58] <timotimo> m: my $ex = try { "1232".rindex('2', 100) CATCH { say .WHAT } };

[21:59] <timotimo> you see how it's an X::AdHoc?

[21:59] <timotimo> this bug has an additional part where going above the threshold doesn't mention the acceptable range of values

[22:00] <dogbert17> m: say "1232".rindex('2',4)

[22:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar b771bc: OUTPUT«index start offset out of range␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[22:00] <timotimo> now we need to decide whether we want rindex to accept $self.chars as a start index and just always return Nil

[22:00] <timotimo> well, -1 really

[22:00] <timotimo> and when you give it more than that it would throw

[22:00] <timotimo> or if the error messages should go with self.chars - 1 instead

[22:01] <dogbert17> I just tried -1 for fun and was surprised when it said the allowed range was 0..4 

[22:02] <dogbert17> but I agree, when the value is to high, something breaks deeper in the code

[22:02] <dogbert17> s/to/too/

[22:03] <dogbert17> when should the code on line 223 fire?

[22:08] <dogbert17> aha, thx for explaining, so which code handles the case when the position is just a bit too large then?

[22:11] <timotimo> that's inside MoarVM

[22:12] <timotimo> in the implementation of the rindex op (probably in src/string/ops.c) there's an MVM_exception_throw_adhoc (or how it's spelled)

[22:13] <dogbert17> so deep in the c code then

[22:14] <timotimo> actually, we have a MVM_string_check_arg function that does all kinds of checks for us

[22:14] <timotimo> no, that's something else

[22:14] <timotimo> a-ha!

[22:49] *** woolfy joined
[22:49] <asdfgh> <a-z 0-9 stuff>.<domain suffix>

[22:51] <timotimo> the first step would be to look at the exact definition for valid domain names

[22:52] <timotimo> now that domain names can also include some parts of unicode, and now that top level domains can be pretty much anything you want ...

[22:53] *** cyphase joined
[22:53] <timotimo> but then you're likely going to want character classes; usually one for the first letter in a domain name and one for the rest

[22:54] <timotimo> like, a - is probably not allowed at the very beginning of a domain name, but after that you can even have -- in a domain name (that's what punycode domains expand to, if i'm not mistaken)

[22:54] <El_Che> is "use v6c" a thing. I mean, does it do something?

[22:54] <timotimo> use v6.c you mean?

[22:54] <El_Che> (I know what it's supposed to do, but with only 6c out there, I wonder if it's implemented)

[22:54] <El_Che> yes

[22:55] *** rgrinberg left
[22:55] <timotimo> we have beginnings of "ability to use a 6.d setting" that i haven't looked very closely at
