[04:39] <Xliff> Methinks IO::Handle.slurp-rest on an 90M file might not be a good idea.

[04:39] <timotimo> if you slurp it with :bin, it'll be less problematic

[04:39] *** cpage_ joined
[04:39] *** Cabanossi left
[04:42] *** Cabanossi joined
[04:42] <Xliff> Even though it is text?

[04:43] <timotimo> well, there's multiple aspects to this

[04:43] <timotimo> one, we normalize to NFG, which means combining characters will turn into sinlge graphemes

[04:43] <Xliff> And the read never finished before I re-ran using :bin

[04:43] <timotimo> when you spurt it back out to utf8, you might end up with different output

[04:44] <Xliff> Oh, and YAMLish doesn't work on YAML output from a game I am playing. :(

[04:44] <timotimo> the other thing is, we internally store all codepoints as 32bit integers, so if your text is almost exclusively what fits into ascii, it goes from 8 bits per character to 32bits per character

[04:44] <timotimo> which is a big inflation

[04:44] <Xliff> I may need to see why it is broken and submit a patch.

[04:44] <Xliff> Ah. Yes, that is.

[04:44] <timotimo> i didn't know YAMLish survives its own tests

[04:45] <Xliff> But this is a lot of data. I really wish they would have continued to use SQLite exports.

[04:45] <Xliff> LOL! I don't think it's configured.

[04:45] <timotimo> as far as i know yamlish is b0rked. or perhaps i'm thinking of an older module and somebody else built a YAML parser/emitter in the mean time?

[04:46] <Xliff> I may just need to get the MySQL dumps and make my own mapping files. *sigh*

[04:46] <timotimo> in any case, you can still use a yaml module from perl or python with the Inline:: modules

[04:46] <Xliff> No. That's the one. Honestly, I was optimistic and just installed it and ran tests.

[04:46] <Xliff> OK. How do you use an installed Python module using Inline::Python? The docs don't say.

[04:47] <Xliff> I looked at that, first.

[04:47] <Xliff> The only thing I see is Inline::Python::run($script) .... which is bad on many fronts.

[04:47] <timotimo> yeah, hmm.

[04:48] <timotimo> https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/master/t/call.t#L73 - there's also this kind of thing

[04:48] <Xliff> Yeah. Parsing YAML or large JSON isn't going to work when all I need are ID to Name mappings.

[04:49] <Xliff> Oh, I guess I could use import and run it that way.

[04:49] <Xliff> Hmmm.... thanks!

[08:33] <Xliff> masak: No. That's all I got.

[08:33] <masak> I mean, can you play around with the hash size, essentially bisecting it?

[08:33] <Xliff> masak: Yeah. I'll play around with that, tomorrow.

[08:33] <masak> I've gotten similar bailouts when I've put ridiculously many lexical variables in the same scope.

[08:34] <Xliff> Remind me. I'm too tired to do that right now and I need a nap. I need to be up in another 3 hours.

[08:47] <masak> it's not a nice password, for the record. far too short for 2016. and https://xkcd.com/936/ applies.

[08:48] <moritz> really depends on the use case

[08:48] <moritz> if it's something that can only be attacked through the network, 13 chars is plenty

[08:48] <moritz> also, the question is, what standards do you apply

[08:48] <masak> all valid points.

[09:13] <masak> no, please keep it up

[09:13] <Xliff> Heh!

[09:13] <masak> moritz: good news: `git clean -xdf` fixed the problem in HEAD, too

[09:14] <masak> moritz: am I wrong in thinking it's... unsatisfactory that a target called *realclean* doesn't really clean things enough, but `git clean -xdf` does?

[09:14] *** TEttinger left
[09:15] <moritz> masak: yes

[09:15] <Xliff> Maybe "realclean" should test for .git and add that command?

[09:16] <moritz> masak: so the next time this happens, please do a "make realclean" first, then a "git clean -xdf", and note which files weren't deleted

[09:16] <moritz> Xliff: noooo

[09:16] *** bjz left
[09:16] <moritz> Xliff: people occasionally write small test scripts etc. in the root directory, and "make realclean" shouldn't delete them

[09:16] <Xliff> Oooh.

[09:16] <moritz> Xliff: it should only delete files generated during the build

[09:16] <masak> moritz: will do :)

[09:17] <Xliff> Well, that's my new thing learned for the day.

[09:17] <Xliff> Of course, something tells me that after I've done "git clean -xdf" I might need to reinstall all of my modules.

[09:17] <masak> Xliff: besides which, it doesn't sound healthy that the build toolchain have a dependency on Git, at least not for that target.

[09:17] <Xliff> masak: You have a point.

[09:18] <masak> for doing releases, it makes sense, I guess.

[09:18] <moritz> masak: I guess the biggest difference is that "make realclean" doesn't delete install/

[09:18] <Xliff> Yup. Works. So I wonder what "git clean -xdf" did to fix the problem?

[09:18] <masak> moritz: TIL.

[09:19] <masak> moritz: any good reason for that?

[09:19] <Xliff> And yes, it's a clean rakudo installation.

[09:19] <moritz> masak: that's not how things are done :-)

[09:19] <moritz> masak: if rakudo is installed into /, should "make realclean" delete / as well?

[09:19] <Xliff> Shit.

[09:23] <Xliff> No. The binaries did not get installed

[09:23] <moritz> huh

[09:23] <moritz> no wonder the panda bootstrap failed.

[09:24] <Xliff> Wonder why the regression, there.

[09:25] <Xliff> error: pathspec 'nom' did not match any file(s) known to git.

[09:25] <Xliff> panda for nom not found

[09:25] <moritz> Xliff: what command did you launch?

[09:25] <Xliff> "rakudobrew build moar"

[09:25] <Xliff> Which has always worked up until now.

[09:26] <moritz> sounds legit

[09:28] <RabidGravy> it's been doing that for a while, but carries on to work anyway

[09:29] <Xliff> And now "rakudobrew build panda" doesn't work.

[09:30] <Xliff> (cd ~/.rakudobrew/bin; for a in ../moar-nom/install/bin/*; do ln -s $a; done) <-- fixed rakudo but not panda

[10:28] <iH2O> :(

[10:28] <iH2O> i say perl6 is better than LISP for artificial intelligence

[10:29] <RabidGravy> it uses ID3 tags in the audio files for its own purposes, including those created by the show recorder, except if you download one of the recorded shows and then try to re-upload it for for some reason it craps out because it can't parse its own tags :(

[10:31] <sjn> Xliff: how about 16383 and 16384 (2^14)

[10:34] <Xliff> sjn: Good idea. I'll cue those up.

[10:34] <Xliff> Trying 16200 now.

[10:35] <Xliff> But that seems to be lining up with what I am seeing.

[10:35] <Xliff> Takes rakudo 3 minutes to precompile the module. That adds up.

[10:36] *** ocbtec left
[10:36] <Xliff> sjn: Why would static hash definitions be limited, though?

[10:40] <jnthn> The magic number will be around the 16-bit unsigned limit.

[10:40] <jnthn> And that's because passing pairs to a hash constructor is argument passing.

[10:40] <Xliff> Yeah. 16384

[10:40] <jnthn> And there's a limit to how many arguments you may pass.

[10:40] <jnthn> (I don't expect this to change any time soon.)

[10:41] <Xliff> Means I will have to break this up into pieces, then.

[11:04] <hahainternet> my favourite python thing is "do not align assignments"

[11:04] <masak> tbrowder: top of the localtime to you!

[11:04] <hahainternet> why? well just because ok, you don't think the people who wrote PEP8 are 20x smarter than you? :D

[11:04] <hahainternet> then i used go and gofmt aligns things horizontally for you, i fell in love

[11:05] <masak> hahainternet: if you feel strongly about it, write a Python formatting tool that is configured the way you want :)

[11:05] <tbrowder> continuing my problems with p6 pod:  I have scrubbed a bad pod file down to I think a minimum, and used the suggested method to test it

[11:05] <masak> can't be that hard, Python doesn't have much syntax :P

[11:05] <hahainternet> masak: :grin:

[11:05] <RabidGravy> I dunno, this code here the assignments are all aligned neatly

[11:05] <hahainternet> masak: but it's more the fact it goes against the 'official' formatting guidelines

[11:05] <masak> tbrowder: sounds like great news. do you have a gist for us?

[11:05] <hahainternet> RabidGravy: non pep8 compliant code!!!!! (moer exclamations required!)

[11:06] <masak> hahainternet: who cares? honestly. if you and your team are happy with your own guidelines.

[11:06] <masak> (and feel you have good reasons to uphold them)

[11:06] <hahainternet> masak: i absolutely agree, i'm just parodying the python community's approach :)

[11:06] <tbrowder> I'll put it in a gist shortly, but besides the bad pod, the worst part is perl6's response to it leaves no cluse as to what the problem is

[11:06] <hahainternet> i'll stop noising up #perl6

[11:06] <RabidGravy> well to be fair this particular application (Airtime) is an evil mix of python and PHP, I'm just amazed it works at all half the time ;-)

[11:07] <masak> hahainternet: I don't necessarily want to defend the "only one way" mentality... but I can see how its opposite "anything goes" worldview can sometimes lead to trouble, too

[11:07] <hahainternet> masak: it's why i fell in love with gofmt

[11:07] <hahainternet> no more arguing

[11:07] <Xliff> masak: 16360 passes. I think I'll stop there.

[11:08] <tbrowder> for example, executing 'perl6 bad.pod' yields exactly "===SORRY!=== Cannot iterate object with P6opaque representation"

[11:58] <masak> Xliff: pretty sure I've been creating a SQLite database using DBIish.

[11:58] <masak> at some point

[11:58] <masak> tbrowder: no worries. just explaining why I can't be of more assistance right now.

[11:59] <masak> tbrowder: what is it about the error message that you don't consider clear? it gives you the name of the variable, the cause of the warning, the line and the file.

[12:00] <masak> tbrowder: granted, there'll be more things causing the variable being undefined, but you'd basically need to start debugging and/or tracing the data flow backwards in the program in order to find that out. which is Hard and not something I'd expect the compiler to do for me.

[12:00] <tbrowder> masak: yes, that's the starting point, and I intend to track it down, but haven't looked outside the doc repo yet--I suspect it's in rakudo

[13:12] <Xliff> And how can I get rid of it?

[13:13] <timotimo> it means you have a heredoc where the terminator is further to the right than the shortest line is

[13:13] <timotimo> hm. it really could do with reporting a line number if it can

[13:14] <Xliff> Yeah, and I really didn't have any heredocs where the terminator was further right.

[13:14] <Xliff> But I unindented the terminator and the error went away. 

[13:15] <Xliff> Thanks, ("timo" xx 2)

[13:17] <timotimo> did you have tabs in there?

[13:17] <timotimo> by default we interpret tabs to be 8 spaces, unless you set $*TABWIDTH or what it is

[13:18] <Xliff> Ah... that might be it.

[13:19] <Xliff> Now... to see if DBIish will want to load the entire .sqlite3 file before it will run queries.

[13:19] <Xliff> Which would be bad.

[13:19] <timotimo> it doesn't do anything to the file, it just uses the sqlite library

[13:20] <moritz> right

[13:20] <moritz> and I guess sqlite3 doens't do that

[13:20] <timotimo> it probably mmaps, which is much cheaper

[13:20] *** Sgeo left
[13:20] <Xliff> Excellent!

[13:20] <Xliff> However inserting is slow.

[13:20] <RabidGravy> yeah it does

[13:20] <Xliff> Might be coz index.

[13:21] <moritz> also, sqlite isn't designed for heavy, concurrent writes

[13:21] <moritz> that simply requires a server model

[13:21] <Xliff> This isn't a concurrent write use-case.

[13:24] <masak> haven't thought about it that way, but sqlite is kind of interesting *because* the tradeoffs it makes translates to fairly common use cases

[13:24] <RabidGravy> you can turn journalling off with a pragma if you don't think you need it

[13:25] <masak> for example, it's excellent on mobile for local storage

[13:26] <RabidGravy> also in a non concurrent bulk write kind of situation setting the locking mode to exclusive may speed it up

[13:26] <Xliff> masak: That's why I thought of it for this project.

[13:26] <RabidGravy> as it won't bother with row locks

[13:26] *** ocbtec left
[13:27] <Xliff> And once the database is written, it will be read-only, so turning off journaling after the data is loaded would be god.

[13:27] <Xliff> s/god/good/

[13:27] <masak> right

[13:27] <Xliff> Also, are primary keys auto-indexed for SQLite files?

[13:27] <masak> there's probably a fancy term for "the low end of use cases that don't require the full ACID hoopla"

[13:28] <hoelzro> Xliff: yes

[13:28] <RabidGravy> many and varied pragma for tuning https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html

[14:17] <[Coke]> is github slow today or just me?

[14:17] <Xliff> Thanks.

[14:23] <mst> [Coke]: eh? there's already a perl5 channel on this network - #perl - which normally people send them to. you're the first person to ignore the obvious answer and do something inexplicable instead, so I dunno where I should write down "don't be [Coke]" :D

[14:23] <yoleaux> 22 May 2016 20:05Z <moritz> mst: to get that blog post out

[14:23] <[Coke]> mst: I am not the first person to do that. there's no need to be rude.

[14:23] *** itaipu joined
[14:24] <mst> [Coke]: first person I've seen in here do that. I don't know what's rude about the truth.

[14:25] <[Coke]> "don't be [Coke]".

[14:26] <gfldex> mst: so the truth is »"don't be [Coke]"«

[14:26] <lizmat> .oO( don't be mst )

[14:26] <[Coke]> OK. We'll keep not writing it down. I'll try to remember the correct answer next time.

[14:27] <masak> print

[14:27] <mst> [Coke]: if you think there *is* a reason to send somebody to another IRC network, irc.perl.org's website has a channel list on it http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html

[14:27] <masak> heh, stale backlog :P

[14:27] <mst> lizmat: that's also very good advice.

[14:27] <masak> otherwise I'd've beat moritz to the punch, I'm sure :P

[14:28] <mojca1> [Coke]: I tried to update MoarVM, nqp and rakudo in MP, but all tests from t/01-sanity/53-transpose.t on fail

[14:29] <mst> [Coke]: ok, look, I have no idea why, on a network with a very long established #perl channel, you decided to send people to an entire other network instead, and therefore I'm not sure what to write down or where to try and avoid somebody else doing that. if you want to sulk instead of trying to solve the problem, your choice, but that was a genuine statement, not an insult

[14:29] <[Coke]> mst: Historically, that was the channel that we sent people to. It's just inertia on my part, that's all.

[14:29] <masak> I don't mind my last name Mäsak being ASCIIfied to Maesak. but on IRC I greatly prefer just "masak".

[14:29] <mst> [Coke]: wut

[14:29] <mojca1> I get "Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)", I don't know what that means

[14:29] <mst> [Coke]: #perl6 has always sent people to #perl on here and it's fine

[14:29] <[Coke]> mst: "always" is very strong and not true.

[14:29] <mst> [Coke]: you, OTOH, tried to send them to #perl on irc.perl.org which is completely different, not something I've seen in here before, and wrong

[14:30] <[Coke]> I'm probably the only dinosaur left. That's fine, I'll change my stripes.

[14:30] <mst> ok, well, I don't recall 'irc.perl.org #perl' receiving anybody from here

[14:30] <mst> err, up until a few years ago that would've been even more wrong than it is now. I had to play a flamethrower over quite a few of the old regulars to make irc.perl.org #perl habitable ;)

[14:31] <moritz> that's why we sent them to #perl-help or something

[14:31] <moritz> or used to, at least

[14:31] <mst> #perl on here or #perl-help over there are both fine. it was [Coke] trying to send them to #perl over there that I went "eep" at, because I hadn't seen that before and it isn't a good idea

[14:31] <masak> mst: fwiw, I've been known to send people to #perl over on irc.perl.org

[14:32] *** JimmyZ joined
[14:32] <[Coke]> mst: you went quite more than eep.

[14:32] <mst> masak: well, you can [Coke] between you can figure out where to write down "don't do that" then

[14:32] <mojca1> [Coke], are you willing to look into test errors on Mac and report them to a suitable place?

[14:32] <[Coke]> mojca1: for what now?

[14:32] <mst> [Coke]: yeah, well, I don't like throwing newbies into shark tanks and I expect regulars to prefer not shitting on newbies too

[14:32] <masak> mst: I don't know much about either channel, but my impression is that the #perl over at irc.perl.org is higher-traffic and higher-quality in some sense

[14:32] <mst> masak: the irc.perl.org #perl is a social channel and not somewhere to send people with tech questions

[14:33] <mojca1> [Coke], I'm not sure, I get a zillion "Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)" when running "sudo port -v test rakudo" for 2016.05

[14:33] <[Coke]> masak: I'm happy to defer to mst about which perl5 stuff goes where.

[14:33] <mst> irc.perl.org itself documents #perl-help but not #perl for a reason

[14:33] <mst> but obviously nobody reads the website for the network

[14:33] <mst> so I'm still not sure where to write this down

[14:33] <masak> mst: got it. that does sound familiar.

[14:33] <masak> I also remember something about #metallica :)

[14:33] <mst> [Coke]: I'm not refusing to write this down, like you keep pretending

[14:34] <mst> I just don't know where, since evidently you didn't read the existing docs

[14:34] <masak> is it just me, or is it a little tense in here?

[14:34] <mst> the question is, where *would* you look, and how do we patch that?

[14:34] <moritz> masak: it is

[14:34] <mojca1> [Coke]: but I hope you will manage to figure out the details; I'm not a perl6 user myself (hardly even a perl5 user)

[14:34] <mst> if somebody tells me that, I'm happy to help. otherwise, not a lot I can do, sorry

[16:21] <Zoffix> Probably. I fixed a typo recently and it was after my lastest post.

[16:23] <diakopter> kind of like google's date-filtered search results trust the reported date instead of when it actually first appeared

[16:23] <diakopter> (I've seen search results claiming to be from the 1970s)

[16:24] <diakopter> when Google first indexed it is usually more relevant to me

[16:27] <kurahaupo> believe it or not, computers existed before the internet. And history goes back even further

[16:29] <diakopter> I mean, the dates were obviously wrong, and from the 1970s

[16:30] <perlpilot> or ... someone in google invented a time machine

[16:30] * kurahaupo doesn't see a problem with a document that was created in 1840 having that as its mtime when it's transcribed onto a computer, and the webserver serves that date

[16:31] <kurahaupo> (except that 32bit epoch seconds dont go back that far)

[19:47] <dogbert17> hello :), does anyone know if the descripton of the method 'isa' in S32 is correct? https://design.perl6.org/S32/Basics.html#Any

[19:47] *** hahnara joined
[19:47] <timotimo> hm, i think isa also takes strings for types

[19:47] <dogbert17> timitimo: and it seems to have moved to Mu as well

[19:47] <timotimo> also, it looks like it got damaged in editing or something

[19:48] <timotimo> the design docs aren't really kept up to date any more :S

[19:48] <dogbert17> I was thinking of 'stealing' the text and update Mu.pod but I don't want to add nonsense :)

[19:48] <dha> timotimo - that's... unfortunate.

[19:48] *** hahnara left
[19:49] <dha> Especially since I still hear people saying things like "I couldn't find that in the user docs, so I went to the design docs".

[19:49] <timotimo> we're a bit low on people-power

[19:50] <dogbert17> timotimo: should I add the text it to Mu.pod?

[19:50] <dogbert17> s/it//

[19:50] <dha> Ok. Is there a way to fix that? I would certainly be willing to try to put in some time if I had a clear idea of what was needed.

[19:51] <dha> (Note: I ask that with the knowledge that the answer to my question may well be "no")

[19:51] <timotimo> sorry, i'm not confident in deciding whether the design docs should follow what rakudo does or whether rakudo should change to do what the design docs say or whether it's okay to have them diverge

[19:52] <dha> That is certainly a reasonable question. So I guess I move on to the question "is there a way we can resolve that?" (again, realizing there may not be a good answer to that either)

[19:52] <RabidGravy> surely, if the design docs say the thing that is not true as regards implemented and tested behaviour then they're wrong

[19:53] <mst> perhaps the answer in that case is to prepare a patch to the design docs, make sure it's hunked so each difference with rakudo is separate, then get jnthn/larry/whoever to review?

[19:53] <Zoffix> Wasn't there a decision that Roast is the spec and the docs are the human version of that spec. The `design` is outdated and there's no real point in trying to keep it up to date. Hence why we call the specs "speculations" and not "specifications" now.

[19:53] <RabidGravy> but, the actual docs should be the tested behaviour

[19:54] <[Coke]> the design docs are more historical at this point.

[19:54] <stmuk> the tests are Golden Source of Truth

[19:54] <[Coke]> Add a note to this effect at the top of each one, point people at docs.perl6.org, and update things there instead.

[19:54] <RabidGravy> yeah

[19:54] <mst> yes, hence my thought that you prepare updates to the relevant docs to bring them in line with the tests, but then get somebody to double check

[19:55] <mst> seems like generally the updates will be correct, but belt and braces

[19:55] <dogbert17> so you're ok with me adding 'isa' to Mu.pod?

[19:55] <RabidGravy> I am

[19:56] <dogbert17> then it will be done :)

[19:56] <perlpilot> dogbert17: I'm in favor of motion over stagnation  :)

[19:56] <dogbert17> perlpilot: agreed :)

[19:56] <RabidGravy> though maybe noting that a smart match against a type object is probably "better"

[19:57] <dha> I understand the idea the the design docs can be considered historical at this point, but, from a user perspective, since the user docs are often lacking (not a criticism, just how thing are, due to personpower, etc.), that's where people go looking for info.

[19:57] <dha> Until that is not the case, the out-of-date-ness seems problematic. to a new user, in any case.

[19:57] <dogbert17> I'll whip something up and get back to you all in a bit

[19:58] <dha> I am, of course, wholly in favor of the user docs being exhaustive to avoid this problem. ;-)

[19:58] <RabidGravy> well fixing the design docs to fix it seems silly when it's a similar effort to write proper documents

[19:59] <mst> there is always the option of "both"

[19:59] <[Coke]> dha: of course it's problematic.

[19:59] <[Coke]> I agree with you completely there.

[20:00] <[Coke]> mst: we don't have time to do it once, let alone twice.

[20:00] <[Coke]> so it's not really an option, IMO.

[20:00] <mspo> there should be a way to annotate sources to satisfy the "spec", generating docs?

[20:01] <mspo> but keeping two things in sync won't ever work

[20:01] <[Coke]> awwaiid has some plans in that direction.

[20:01] <mst> [Coke]: I'm more thinking "it may be that in some cases tweaking the spec now is doable and writing the docs isn't yet, so doing that first and filling the docs out later may be the least worst optioN"

[20:01] <dha> Ok, so we agree on there being a problem. Should we have a conversation about how to solve the problem? Is there some specific group of people who should have that conversation? (honestly not being snarky here. Just trying to see if there's some way to fix this.)

[20:01] <RabidGravy> feel free etc

[20:01] <Zoffix> Then you have source mixed with docs and the potential range of contributors much smaller.

[20:01] <mst> I leave decisions as to that up to the people actually doing the work, just making sure we look at the permutations

[20:02] <dha> And, yes, I agree that if we have to choose between fixing docs and fixing spec, docs should take precedence. But, if docs can't be fixed, maybe a minor tweak to the spec would be helpful.

[20:02] <Zoffix> Personally, I don't agree that there's a problem. We have a large language and few people to document it. It's a work in progress. Just because someone realized the docs aren't complete and went to read some sort of a technical document which is out of date doesn't mean there's a problem with anything.

[20:03] <RabidGravy> the only thing preventing the docs being improved is people time

[20:03] <dha> Zoffix - Then maybe there should be an explicit statement that those documents are not to be fully trusted?

[20:04] *** cpage_ joined
[20:04] <Zoffix> All the specs, as Coke suggested above.

[20:04] <[Coke]> I think adding a warning to the design docs is in order, esp. if it points people at where to open a github issue saying what they were looking for and couldn't find. In terms of getting docs written, I'd encourage volunteers to write for docs.perl6.org before fixing up the design docs. I don't know if there is more of a plan to be had there.

[20:05] <Zoffix> There's actually already text of that kind on design.perl6.org

[20:05] <Zoffix> Not too obvious, but at least it's there :)

[20:06] <dha> Ok, maybe it should be more obvious. :-)

[20:06] <mst> making sure every page on the design docs has it in big letters at the top would help

[20:06] <mst> I've often gone there via direct links

[20:07] * [Coke] added https://github.com/perl6/specs/issues/110

[20:07] <dha> And having people submit things they were looking for and couldn't find, and have those submissions in an obvious, central place would be tremendously useful

[20:07] <Zoffix> Pffftt.... users and their crazy ways of using websites! *shakes head at mst*

[20:08] <[Coke]> also added https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/541

[20:09] <dha> [Coke]++

[20:10] <mst> Zoffix: yeah, well, I know I'm unusual for clicking the links people give me when I ask questions and actually reading them, but there's the occasional other person with the same superpower

[20:16] <dogbert17> [Coke]: in Mu.pm yes 

[20:17] <dogbert17> can't say it's a syntax that I'm familiar with :(

[20:18] <RabidGravy> I'd leave the name of the invocant out

[20:18] <[Coke]> ok. looks overly verbose to me, but if there's prior art, then no worries in you using it.

[21:34] <AlexDaniel> pmurias: ideally, somebody has to work on the specs too, but there's not enough manpower

[21:34] <dha> So, what I'm thinking is that we can have the qw docs mention the qww version and similarly for qqw. So, qww and qqww wouldn't be searchable, but <> and <<>> would be.

[21:34] <Zoffix> Make Perl 6 super popular to get more people working on the docs!

[21:34] <dha> Not necessarily as a permanent solution, but so that we have the actual documentation there for now.

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> dha: «» is already searchable

[21:35] <dha> and deal with searchability at some later point.

[21:35] <dha> right.

[21:35] <pmurias> AlexDaniel: docs.perl6.org is intended to fullfill both the reference and introduction roles?

[21:35] <AlexDaniel> it just points to http://doc.perl6.org/language/quoting

[21:35] <dha> qww and qqww aren't.

[21:36] <pmurias> maybe we should merge the synopsis with docs.perl6.org?

[21:37] <Zoffix> merge how? 

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> gradually, perhaps

[21:37] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: move stuff from specs to docs, one by one

[21:37] <dha> I'm thinking, since it seems to me that people would be *more* likely to search for the operators, rather than the qw versions, we put the w/ww distinction in the qw and qqw sections for now, and worry about searches for qww and qqww at some later point, but put the distinctions in the existing entries so the documentation is at least written and available if not wholly searchable.

[21:38] <masak> pmurias: the synopses and docs.perl6.org have different target demographics.

[21:38] *** jjido joined
[21:38] <masak> users and implementors, respectively.

[21:38] <Zoffix> AlexDaniel, wouldn't that make docs.perl6.org overly complex?

[21:38] <dha> Also, the synopses are not up to date. Wait, didn't we have this discussion earlier? :-)

[21:38] <pmurias> masak: how do those demographics differ?

[21:38] <Zoffix> Kinda like Perl 5's perldocs. You get a giant wall of text for everything :(

[21:38] <masak> pmurias: are you kidding me? :)

[21:39] <pmurias> masak: it's a serious question

[21:39] <masak> pmurias: as an implementor of a Perl 6 implementation, I need to know what a lexical closure is. what a continuation is. what bounded serialization is.

[21:39] <AlexDaniel> Zoffix: not if we assign you to do that. Look at your blog posts, they're fun to read, they give basic introduction, and yet they talk about some details

[21:39] <masak> as a user of the language, I don't, necessarily.

[21:39] <dha> masak -  it's not as ridiculous a question as it sounds. user docs are incomplete, so people often wind up looking at the design docs to find answers not covered in the user docs.

[21:40] <pmurias> masak: what's bounded serialization?

[21:40] <dha> Again, I think there's a distant echo in here. :-)

[21:40] <masak> pmurias: it's something Rakudo does to communicate between BEGIN time and runtime.

[21:40] *** spider-mario left
[21:41] <masak> dha: maybe my distinct lack of backlogging is at fault here. if so, apologies.

[21:41] <pmurias> masak: that's what serialization is ;)

[21:41] <AlexDaniel> masak: although I partially agree with you, I'm not sure why these things can't be on docs.perl6.org. Perhaps not amidst tutorial-ish stuff, but still

[21:41] <dha> masak -  it was a while back. no worries.

[21:42] <masak> pmurias: no arguments there. in Rakudo it's called "bounded serialization" for reasons I either never learned or can't remember.

[21:42] <dha> WRT the differentiation between reference and tutorial, I note that there are several p5 perldocs that are explicitly tutorials. Is there a reason that extensive tutorial material can't be in separate docs?

[21:43] <masak> pmurias: the modifier "bounded" is however not vital to my point, which is: as a non-implementor user, I usually don't have to worry about serialization on the compiler/runtime level. I wouldn't expect to find (much of) it in the user docs.

[21:43] *** jjido left
[21:43] *** ocbtec left
[21:43] <AlexDaniel> dha: actually, we already have some tutorials here: http://doc.perl6.org/language.html

[21:43] <dha> So, I guess the answer is "no, there is no reason that can't happen". :-)

[21:44] <pmurias> masak: IMHO that depends on the type of a user

[21:45] <perlpilot> masak: it's bounded because we only serialize things in the current compilation unit IIRC.  Even if they reference items in other compilation units.  (or something like that)

[21:45] <pmurias> masak: it seems to me there is a huge difference between learning perl 6 and looking up what happens to your objects at runtime

[21:46] <perlpilot> masak: But, I'm sure if you really care about why it's called "bounded serialization", you can ask jnthn  :)

[21:46] <RabidGravy> isn't that a new document then

[21:46] <Zoffix> stmuk, any idea why my blog posts disappeared from pl6anet.org ? I'm guessing my RSS XML is missing some keys.... any idea which?

[21:48] <pmurias> masak: when I want to deeply understand something I have similiar needs to the implementor

[21:50] <timotimo> MadcapJake: i just finished your iterators/generators post. nice :)

[21:50] <pmurias> Zoffix: I love wall of text style perldocs ;)

[21:50] <AlexDaniel> .oO( it would be interesting to have a “GIMME MORE INFO” button. Each time you press it, more stuff appears )

[21:51] <dha> Out of curiosity, why are there quoting adverbs? Are they ever useful? I mean in their ':q', ':w', etc. forms?

[21:51] <timotimo> .o( method pull-a-fast-one ... )

[21:52] <dha> I mean, I can't see a reason to ever use, say, Q :q :w// and I'm not sure how else you would use them.

[21:52] <timotimo> dha: sure there are, if you want to write a string literal that's supposed to contain { }, you can :!c in front and not have to escape the curlies

[21:53] <timotimo> and of course for heredocs you always use the :to adverb

[21:53] <Zoffix> stmuk, never mind. Reading the source tells me I'm missing the modified date https://metacpan.org/source/DAVECROSS/Perlanet-0.56/lib/Perlanet.pm

[21:53] <dha> And you would do that instead of not using curlies as your delimiters... why?

[21:53] *** _dolmen_ joined
[21:53] <timotimo> not for delimiters

[21:53] <dha> oh, right.

[21:54] <timotimo> that's what i meant.

[21:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar b348f2: OUTPUT«hey, dha, {how are you?}␤»

[21:54] <dha> ok. so the useless ones are there for consistency? :-)

[21:55] <timotimo> they are also how we implement the different quoting constructs

[21:55] <dha> ok. So they should actually be documented somewhere. I'm not tackling that at the moment...

[21:55] <timotimo> but yeah, i suppose, consistency

[21:57] <dha> huh. interesting. Qc works, but Q!c does not. the latter requires the colon while the former does not.

[21:58] <timotimo> yeah, probably because we have a shortcut for that for convenience

[21:58] <timotimo> just like qw

[21:58] <dha> That's... annoying. But quite possibly unavoidable, I suppose.

[21:58] <masak> pmurias: I hear what you're saying -- you're the kind of user who often asks questions similar to what an implementor would.

[22:00] <masak> pmurias: the synopses have often been described as "dry". the reason for this has been that they don't need to be verbose and descriptive to users, only enough for implementors.

[22:01] <masak> to me, "merging" doesn't sound like "combining the strengths of both" in this case. it sounds like "trying to serve two wildly different groups with a single thing"

[22:01] <dha> oop. S02 says if you want to abbreviate quoting constructs, "just define a macro". I feel odd saying "just do this" with something that spits at you with EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE!

[22:02] <timotimo> hehehe

[22:06] *** Sgeo joined
[22:09] <dha> Ugh. I think we're going to have to define "quote preservation" before I document the difference between :w and :ww. In particular, what counts as a quote in this context.

[23:54] <MasterDuke> AlexDaniel: .resolve currently stops "resolving" and just returns what's left of what it was given when it hits a part of the given path that doesn't exist

[23:54] <AlexDaniel> MasterDuke: I see, that's fine

[23:55] <AlexDaniel> I don't think that it's a bug anymore, I was wrong

[23:55] <MasterDuke> i'd say it's LTA though

[23:56] <MasterDuke> my PR has it fail if it hits something that doesn't exist
