[10:01] <lizmat> no, haven't got that, but maybe a slurp(URI:D) candidate would be a better interface ?  and/or a .URI method turning a string into an URI object, simular to .IO ?

[10:02] *** _slade_ left
[10:12] <grondilu> Have you considered qx ?

[10:12] <grondilu> qqx{wget $uri} or something?

[10:12] <grondilu> I mean, Perl 6 is a scripting programming language after all

[10:13] <lizmat> lynx --dump  :-)

[10:14] <grondilu> I suppose curl is the most standard tool for that

[10:18] <grondilu> unit module URI::Fetch; our sub fetch(Str $uri) is export { qqx{curl -o - -q $uri} }

[10:18] <psch> great, 2/3 platforms covered :)

[10:18] <grondilu> meh

[10:21] <grondilu> anytime you use qx, you can't expect it to be portable.  Yet qx has not been removed form the language, so I guess portability is not a dogma

[10:21] <psch> i'm just saying 'That is something that does "I don't care how but get me the content of this URI" by trying all available methods' sounds like it wants to pay attention to portability

[10:22] <grondilu> I disagree, it seems to me he just wants convenience.

[10:23] <psch> fair enough :)

[14:00] *** Actualeyes left
[14:00] <grondilu> so shouldn't it use my multi?

[14:00] <timotimo> no

[14:00] <timotimo> it's not a fallback, it's a call

[14:01] <timotimo> multis are lexical, the postfix:<^n> sub doesn't have your ** candidate in its lexical scope

[14:02] <grondilu> :/

[14:02] <timotimo> a known problem with operators and such

[14:04] <grondilu> what is it trying to do then?

[14:04] <grondilu> m: class A does Numeric {}; say A.new²

[14:04] <camelia> rakudo-moar 127b3b: OUTPUT«Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 60336 bytes␤»

[14:04] <grondilu> well that's dumb

[14:05] <grondilu> would it help to have a stub candidate in Numeric?

[14:05] <grondilu> multi infix:<**>(Numeric $, Numeric $) {...}

[14:06] <grondilu> so that we'd have the equivalent of a virtual function or something?

[14:07] <grondilu> though frankly I thought that was what protos do.

[14:07] *** pecastro_ left
[14:07] <timotimo> ?

[14:08] <timotimo> no, when you define a multi candidate, the scope of the candidate is also lexical

[14:08] <grondilu> kj

[14:08] <grondilu> ^scrap that

[14:08] <timotimo> when you have something that "does Numeric", things will try to call .Numeric on it

[14:08] <timotimo> .Numeric will return self in its default implementation

[14:08] *** mxco86 left
[14:08] *** bjz left
[14:08] <timotimo> infix:<**> will call a.Numeric ** b.Numeric

[14:09] <grondilu> :/

[14:09] <grondilu> I thought it was doing that only in last resort

[14:09] <grondilu> that is when no &infix:<**> was defined.

[14:10] <timotimo> if no better candidate is in the lexical scope where the call happens, that is what happens

[14:11] <timotimo> at some point an idea was to have all manner of subs and functions import operators they use from the caller's lexical scope

[14:11] <timotimo> we don't have an implementation of that yet, though

[14:11] <grondilu> now that I think about it, I remember stumbling upon a similar issue.

[14:11] <timotimo> yeah

[14:11] <grondilu> I solved it by implementing all operators with a method form.

[14:12] <timotimo> it's stumblable

[14:12] <grondilu> like multi method power(A: UInt $) {...}

[14:12] <grondilu> and then multi infix:<**>(A $a, $n) { $a.power($n) }

[14:13] <grondilu> if we did that with Numeric, we could define:

[14:13] <grondilu> m: multi infix:<**>(Numeric $x, UInt $n) { $x.power($n) }

[14:13] <camelia> rakudo-moar 127b3b: ( no output )

[14:13] <grondilu> so that we could properly extend Numeric by defining a power method.

[14:15] <grondilu> today I was trying to square a vector with my Clifford module, wrote $v² and got an error, even though $v**2 works fine.  Thought that was very much LTA. 

[14:17] <grondilu> basically it seems to me that when implementing the Numeric role, it is often necessary to re-invent the wheel, which kinds of defeat the purpose of implementing a role :/

[14:17] <grondilu> *kind of defeats

[14:19] <grondilu> that makes me wonder:  is there a method-like way to call an infix operator?

[14:19] <moritz> m: say 1.&infix:<+>(2)

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 127b3b: OUTPUT«3␤»

[14:19] <timotimo> m: say 100.&[+](5)

[14:19] <camelia> rakudo-moar 127b3b: OUTPUT«105␤»

[14:20] <grondilu> but I suppose that would not help, as it would still rely on lexical scope, method resolution or something. 

[14:21] <grondilu> s/method/rather than method/

[14:21] <timotimo> correct

[14:22] <grondilu> maybe the Numeric role should define methods like ADD, MULTIPLY, POWER

[14:22] <grondilu> or at least require them

[14:23] <grondilu> multi method ADD(Numeric $) {...}  # something like that

[14:23] *** hankache left
[14:23] <timotimo> i'm pretty sure Numeric is for things that can be turned into a Complex or Real

[14:23] <timotimo> but i don't know much about the numeric tower in perl6

[14:23] <timotimo> how it exists or doesn't exist

[14:24] *** pierre_ left
[14:24] *** xinming_ left
[14:25] *** xinming joined
[14:25] <grondilu> lots of things can be turned into Complex or Real, but that's not the issue.  The issue is that when implementing the Numeric role, one should not have to redefine operators that depend on others (like &infix:<²>)

[14:26] <timotimo> makes sense, yeah

[14:26] <grondilu> frankly I should even not have to define &[**] as long as I define &[*]

[14:28] <grondilu> so arguably the Numeric role could require any class implementing it to define at least two methods:  ADD and MULTIPLY

[14:28] *** firstdayonthejob left
[14:32] *** firstdayonthejob joined
[14:32] <grondilu> in https://github.com/grondilu/clifford/blob/master/lib/Clifford.pm6 for instance, I had to define things as simple as substraction:

[14:32] <grondilu> multi prefix:<->(MultiVector $A) returns MultiVector is export { return -1 * $A }

[14:33] <grondilu> ^that was silly.  I was hoping this was inherited from Numeric

[14:33] <grondilu> .-2s/substraction/negation/

[14:35] <timotimo> TimToady probably has something wise to say about the trade-offs here
