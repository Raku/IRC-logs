[00:55] <samcv> why is it called Rakudo 'blead' why spelled this way? does it mean something special?

[00:56] <viki> mst told me once, but I forgot

[00:57] <viki> 16:14 mst iBakeCake: because that's been the perl tradition forever

[00:57] <viki> 16:15  I believe it's because that branch is the bleading edge

[00:57] <TimToady> at some point "the bleeding edge" was misspelled in Perl 5 culture

[00:57] <TimToady> and it stuck

[00:57] <viki> heh

[00:57] <samcv> that's not how you spell bleeding tho

[00:57] <geekosaur> 2016 Oct 21 16:14:57 <mst>	iBakeCake: because that's been the perl tradition forever

[00:57] <geekosaur> 2016 Oct 21 16:15:19 <mst>	I believe it's because that branch is the bleading edge

[00:57] <samcv> hah i see TimToady 

[00:57] <geekosaur> right, but bleeding edge is itself a pun on leading edge

[00:58] <geekosaur> and I see viki found their log first, o well

[00:59] <samcv> i was pretty sure it was refering to blades, like the bleeding edge the edge that is sharp and causes bleeding etc

[00:59] <geekosaur> that is where the original pun came from

[00:59] <samcv> but i guess. the perl version could be leading?

[00:59] <geekosaur> the leading edge of development is sharp and can cut you...

[01:00] <geekosaur> so this is kinda trending back toward the original without losing the pun completely

[01:01] <samcv> well i mean there's also cutting edge as well.

[01:20] <seatek> much of that thinking must go on with perl anyway, as it parses with its many ways of figuring out what people may have meant

[01:20] <seatek> so at what point does it actually become an error 

[01:20] <seatek> i hadn't really thought of that before

[01:23] <TimToady> The problem with a compiler that guesses right most of the time is what happens when it doesn't.  :)

[01:23] *** pierre_ left
[01:24] <geekosaur> hence my shudder about WATFIV

[01:24] <geekosaur> first commercial compiler to do such on the fly correction. when it worked it was great, but when it was wrong, oh was it ever WRONG

[01:25] <geekosaur> ...and this in a language that was simple enough that such guessing was much easier than it would be in perl (any version)

[01:27] <AlexDaniel> well, it does not have to be fully autonomous

[01:27] <seatek> that's what the danger slider is for :)

[04:17] *** b7j0c joined
[04:18] <b7j0c> so I recently stumbled upon the "is pure" annotation for subroutines...how meaningful is this given perl6's strong support for powerful exceptions?

[04:19] <b7j0c> I realize "is pure" is probably just ignored now...but it seems an odd claim to make in perl6 that subs can be side-effect free

[04:21] *** pierre_ left
[04:22] *** pierre_ joined
[04:25] <ZzZombo> why"

[04:25] <ZzZombo> ?*

[04:25] <ZzZombo> sub x is pure {put 'x'}

[04:28] *** dataf4l left
[04:28] *** dataf3l_ left
[04:29] <b7j0c> but thats just an expression. if you take a parameter, you have to assume it can carry an exception 

[04:30] <b7j0c> perl6 doesn't complain when i attach "is pure" to functions that throw exceptions, for example

[04:31] <b7j0c> how can a sub be "pure" if it doesn't even return a value of its signature?

[04:32] *** pierre_ left
[04:33] <b7j0c> almost seems to be begging a "noexcept" annotation a la c++

[04:46] *** pierre_ left
[05:02] *** khw left
[05:06] *** adu left
[05:07] <b7j0c> actually, even "put 'x'" is not "pure"

[05:13] <TimToady> the primary purpose of 'is pure' is to tell the compiler that it is allowed to do constant folding with it

[05:16] <TimToady> it is an assertion that any given set of arguments will always produce the same result

[05:17] <TimToady> secondarily, we can report "Useless use" of any pure function in sink context, since the only reason to call any function in sink context is for side effects

[05:18] <b7j0c> so should "is pure" cause the runtime to fail if I do something like get the time-of-day in a sub and do something with it?

[05:19] <TimToady> 'is pure' is not for adding any kind of type checking

[05:19] <TimToady> it is not an instruction to check anything

[05:20] <b7j0c> I guess I can't figure out if it is a promise I am supposed to be making to the runtime or the runtime to me..or what are the implications of lying

[05:20] <TimToady> it is merely an assertion of something you already know to be true, and if you put it on non-pure functions, it's your own fault :)

[05:21] <TimToady> it's merely an assertion to the compiler that there are no side effects, nor is there any internal state that would cause the function to be non-idempotent

[05:22] <TimToady> hence it is safe to assume we can call it once at compile time to do constant folding when we know the arguments are known at compile time

[05:22] <b7j0c> feels more like "can memoize" than "is pure"

[05:22] <b7j0c> if i ask the runtime to memoize a function result and then I end up blowing my own foot off, its on me

[05:24] <TimToady> memoizing has additional run-time ramifications, especially for types that are not value types

[05:24] <TimToady> but yes, pure is a kind of subset of that, as we use it

[05:24] <b7j0c> cool, thanks for the clarification

[05:28] <TimToady> another slight difference is that it's pretty much always a win to do constant folding on a pure function, but the benefit of memoizing depends critically on usage patterns, since a cache does you no good if you never repeat a calculation

[05:29] <TimToady> and if you limit the size of the cache, you lose the benefit if it does not repeat often enough

[05:30] <TimToady> which is why we've had a separate 'is cached' that we've played with from time to time

[09:14] <LeCamarade> I know this channel is much too civil to poke fun at other languages, even though it has richly earned the right to. However, the recent article by Zed Shaw on Python 3's failures is proof-positive of why Perl 6 was doing the right things the right way all along.

[09:14] <LeCamarade> Even if it takes 15 years, let it take 15 years and a serious and humble attempt to get things right and composable, rather than the mad rush that has ended up at Python 3.

[09:14] <moritz> LeCamarade: I'd like that to be to true, but I don't see the evidence

[09:15] <LeCamarade> https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html

[09:15] <moritz> the usage numbers for python 3 are higher than Perl 6, both in relative and absolute numbers

[09:15] <moritz> and the damage done to pyhon 2 and perl 5 is hard to quantify

[09:15] <LeCamarade> Yes, but Perl 6 is a hundred-year language. Python 3 is a feeble attempt at Python 1.0.

[09:16] *** CIAvash left
[09:16] <LeCamarade> My point is that Py3 is a terrible mess. I have been deploying production stuff on the latest Pythons for many years now. I have much less confidence in Py3 than I would have in PHP 5. No jokes.

[09:18] <LeCamarade> Perl 6 got difficult problems right; it is a genuine improvement on Perl 5.20! Python 3, on the other hand, clearly did not have a humble linguist agonising over the features and how they work together.

[09:20] <timotimo> the very early days of py3 were extremely bumpy, but isn't it the clear winner over py2 nowadays at least?

[09:21] <LeCamarade> Py3 assumed improvements to a language at this point would be easy. Wrong. TimToady knew right.

[09:21] <timotimo> i have stopped using python for my stuff when i joined the p6 community, but back then py3 was painful to use (no numpy or scipy or something)

[09:21] <moritz> at $work, we use py3 for new projects, and it works fine

[09:22] <LeCamarade> timotimo No. It is actually worse now. For example: we know about the Unicode implementation in Perl 6, and it is extremely far removed from where Py3 is _headed_. See that?

[09:22] <LeCamarade> moritz Yes, I use Py3 too, and that is why I know to hate it! :-D I was hoping to convert all my Py2.7 projects on GAE to Py3 (having earlier moved them from Py2.5), and so I started messing with it. Dear God.

[09:24] <seatek> Only time I've ever messed with Python is when I've had to go fix or tweak little things here or there. Reminds me of playing with plastic Lego blocks.

[09:24] <moritz> I guess the experience for a conversion is quite different than for a green-field project

[09:25] <LeCamarade> SourceBaby: fine, I stopped looking for a new scripting language ever since Perl 6 came out, but before that time, I was probably one of the first to deploy Ruby 2.0 (called 1.9 at the time). I have a website running on Rakudo Star. I do bleeding edge. And Python 3 is haemorrhaging edge.

[09:25] <seatek> oh my gosh, "once" is not fooling around. it even survives multiple different class instantiations.

[09:25] <LeCamarade> (I meant to write "So", not "SourceBaby".)

[09:26] <seatek> m: class D { method m() { once say 'this'; }}; my $c = D.new; $c.m; my $d = D.new; $d.m; my $e = D.new; $e.m;

[09:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´this‚ê§¬ª

[09:27] <seatek> anyone know of a way to make it be... once... until i tell you again that you haven't done it? :)

[09:27] <LeCamarade> I just want to say something to this channel, and I hope it makes it to TimToady somehow: the slow, deliberate, careful approach to going beyong Perl 5 was exactly the right thing to do. Otherwise, Perl 6 would have been the kind of trivial (probably illusory) improvement on the former.

[09:28] <seatek> I think the people here are really wonderful people LeCamarade

[09:28] <LeCamarade> Even Python 3 was more than 15 years in the making (as ovid or someone once pointed out in an e-mail spat about why Perl 6 was taking forever). I for one had been waiting for Perl 6 for 10 of those years.

[09:30] <LeCamarade> seatek Yeah, I find that they are nice. But there is a time for peace and a time for war. I am more on the latter end. ;-) The thing is, there is a time to say that "That sucks!" and I can never trust these people to say it so directly. Now, Perl 6 rocks to high heaven, because a man who was called to do languages for God (he was going to be a Bible translator) worked on it as his life's work. Py3 sucks, because they did not understand that this matter

[09:31] <timotimo> seatek: build your own state variable and give the user access to resetting it by making it named

[09:32] <seatek> seatek: yeah that's what i was going to do. either that, or beg for a onceish function

[09:32] <seatek> i'm amazed it survives through that

[09:32] <seatek> LeCamarade: it sounds stressful

[09:33] <seatek> i say let them play with their legos :)

[09:34] <LeCamarade> seatek Not if you feel called to do it; not if you feel incomplete otherwise. Isn't all this geekery and math stressful to you? ;-)

[09:36] <seatek> naw i kinda go zen on it. but arguing with people is is stressful to me. the mentalities are very different. python people seem to believe in One Way that is correct. and so it's very hard to help them see other things and ways

[09:36] <seatek> at least that's what i've found

[09:37] <seatek> i think it's good to have the good fights out there though :)

[09:37] <timotimo> we've seen enough good snark about python having more than one way, and in some cases all ways suck :(

[09:37] <LeCamarade> Fine, but they are failing in their own methodology because they did not have someone sit down and figure out the one right way to do the one-right-way language. Py3 emphatically isn't it.

[09:38] <seatek> i hear ya :)

[09:38] <LeCamarade> On the other hand, Perl 6 clearly understands the philosophy behind it so well that I can enforce a pythonic worldview in it--python done properly, even provably, in perlistic terms.

[09:39] *** wamba left
[09:41] <LeCamarade> You see, Py3 thought that "all we need is to tweak this here." Wrong. This deep into the 21st century, if you are doing a language++, and especially if you break backward compatibility, you had better have had someone sit and think. We are not interested in yet another new syntax. Honestly, it is relieving that Perl 6 is so well-done that I do not expect to look around ever again. A pity I still can't get it to run on my Raspberry Pi! :-(

[09:41] <seatek> yeah one of the first things that struck me when starting into Perl6 was that somehow it felt WAY more structured, yet still felt almost completely free at the same time. Very odd. 

[09:42] *** dakkar joined
[09:42] *** noganex left
[09:42] <seatek> ok who needs once?? not me

[09:42] <LeCamarade> Now I use only two languages: Haskell and Perl 6. It used to be Haskell and Ruby, but Ruby was only for programs less than 301 lines long. Perl 6, which I write almost entirely statically-typed, can sustain thousands of lines. Py3 has not even began to be more-useful than Forth in that regard. It's an unfortunate joke.

[09:42] *** noganex joined
[09:44] <seatek> i'm pretty well committed to Perl 6 for life now. which may be quite short, if i shoot myself because of the size/compiling stuff continuing to grow on this crazy thing

[09:45] <LeCamarade> What makes it all the more poignant for me is that, when Perl 6 was "delayed", the noise was (as is typical for us) all about how long it was taking. When I saw the result, I knew it was God who had commissioned TimToady. The result is what should have mattered. And this thing is insanely brilliant. I have been a language fanatic from my childhood, and very early on I decided I wanted a "perfect" language. I am sure I meant a "hundred-year language". P

[09:46] *** pmurias joined
[09:46] <LeCamarade> seatek Good on you! :-) That makes two of us. I literally do not bother with alternatives anymore. If you have an alternative for "system software", preferably Haskell, you should be fine. Lucky you, though, because I, on the other hand, have not yet successfully compiled Rakudo Star on my computer! :-(

[09:47] <LeCamarade> (I mean my domestic-usage computer; it is a Raspberry Pi. So whenever I do something there, it is in Haskell, or Perl 5 because I can now tolerate that weirdness if I know I am not bound to it for the long haul.)

[09:47] <seatek> LeCamarade: maybe you've been a very naughty person and you're being punished. while i, on the other hand, am practically perfect... ;)

[09:48] <LeCamarade> seatek I am sure I have been naughty. However, punishment should hurt some more than this ... :-D

[09:49] <seatek> i think you'll make a great holy crusader LeCamarade :)

[09:50] <seatek> i'm far too self absorbed i think .. :)

[09:50] <pmurias> LeCamarade: re the anti python 3 rant, Perl 6 also avoids hidden binary data to unicode conversions

[09:51] <LeCamarade> seatek Thanks! I wish you knew how right you are ... :-D (Hint: sacralist Reformed Presbyterians still exist, and they do believe in armed revolution, and, if they are me, are actively working to that end.)

[09:51] *** CIAvash joined
[09:53] <LeCamarade> pmurias Yes, but Perl 6 is way more orthogonal: in regular expressions (using Unicode classes, while Py3 goes "Wha'?"), and in allowing, say, Unicode quotes that work as they should (where Py3 just dies).

[09:54] *** labster left
[09:54] <LeCamarade> pmurias Actually, when it comes to Unicode, at present, no man should mention Perl 6 and a joke like Py3 in the same breath. World apart. I write _all_ my strings with proper quotes. _All_ of them. I cannot even type them because this client does not do Unicode as well as my Perl 6 does.

[09:54] <LeCamarade> ‚ÄúQuotes‚Äù

[09:54] <LeCamarade> Yay!

[09:55] <LeCamarade> So, yeah: in _every_ case, in my code, I writes strings either as ‚Äústrings‚Äù or as ‚Äòstrings‚Äô, depending on the need.

[09:56] <LeCamarade> And that is just one problem! I cannot live without that, by the way, because I insist on it as much as I insist on the commas, for which you can see evidence in my chats (since, unlike the quotes, I was already sure they would work ‚Ä¶).

[09:56] <timotimo> it does have the benefit of giving a clear start and end quote, for nesting and such

[09:56] <timotimo> though our smart quote stuff might be problematic for that? giving you multiple possible end-quotes for the same start-quote?

[09:56] <timotimo> m: say ‚Äöfoo‚Äô; say ‚Äòbar‚Äô

[09:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´foo‚ê§bar‚ê§¬ª

[09:56] <timotimo> m: say ‚Äöfoo‚Äònested?‚Äôbar‚Äô

[09:56] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´5===SORRY!5=== Error while compiling <tmp>‚ê§Two terms in a row‚ê§at <tmp>:1‚ê§------> 3say ‚Äöfoo‚Äò7‚èè5nested?‚Äôbar‚Äô‚ê§    expecting any of:‚ê§        infix‚ê§        infix stopper‚ê§        postfix‚ê§        statement end‚ê§        statement‚Ä¶¬ª

[09:56] <LeCamarade> I also already use things like ‚Üí and the like in my Haskell. So I expected it to work. In Perl 6, it does.

[09:56] <timotimo> okay, not nested with those kinds of quotes

[09:57] <timotimo> m: say ‚Äòfoo‚Äònested?‚Äôbar‚Äô

[09:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´foo‚Äònested?‚Äôbar‚ê§¬ª

[09:57] <timotimo> with this kind, though, it works

[09:57] <timotimo> yeah, that makes sense

[09:57] <timotimo> you don't want to have a quote character that you don't realize is a valid start-quote give you nesting within what you know to be your start-and-end marks

[09:58] <LeCamarade> timotimo And that is just one simple thing that a grammar nazi like myself just cannot otherwise tolerate not having. Only one language gets it right. And that is one simple _source code_ matter! There are many millions of others. You still have stupid regexen in Py3. And they took as long at it as TimToady took with Perl 6! It‚Äôs an unfortunate joke.

[10:00] <LeCamarade> You still have an ‚Äúinterpreted‚Äù language, and you still have to use ‚Äúlex and yacc‚Äù to get a string parse. Not funny.

[10:01] <timotimo> yeah, put the heaviest of quotations on the word ‚Äòinterpreted‚Äô

[10:02] <LeCamarade> For ranges, I use the proper di√¶reses: ‚Ä¶

[10:02] <timotimo> that term has long lost most of its usefulness

[10:02] *** AlexDaniel joined
[10:03] <LeCamarade> Unless it really means nothing now, you should be able to tell your interpreted-language parser to just adopt _these other rules_ while it goes over _that other line_. We think this is a big deal because our bar has been set way too low by things like Py3.

[10:12] <AlexDaniel> LeCamarade: the issue with - is that it is used both as a hyphen and a minus

We know how much work and time it was to improve on Perl 5, and, good as that was, it was still something that could desperately use some improvement. Now, Perl 6 is a completely different opus. It would take a dedicated monastery about 100 years of humble monks trying things, praying, then coding, before Perl 7 could happen. And yet Perl 7 could happen.

[10:29] <LeCamarade> For one, I am only now focussed on changing the runtime. Rakudo Star is fine for getting me off the ground. Ultimately, it must be a Forth that is running Perl 6. Imagine that: Perl 6 (where Haskell won‚Äôt do)and the lot running on a Forth machine. That is what I am working towards. Now, I genuinely was going to take the time to do a proper ‚Äúhundred-year language‚Äù, but then Perl 6 happened. I have only the other parts to work on, now.

[10:29] <AlexDaniel> it is based on dvorak (that is, all letters are in normal dvorak positions), but everything else is different

[10:29] <AlexDaniel> however, you must have a japanese keyboard to use it properly

[10:32] *** ribasushi joined
[10:33] <AlexDaniel> and given that most of rakudo is written in Perl¬†6, I suspect you will like it

[10:33] <LeCamarade> AlexDaniel Yes. The right direction does not exclude loud declarations, even as it includes contributing to the core development.

[10:34] <LeCamarade> Meanwhile, I am only going to be taking on development starting next year, and primarily on ARM64. On FreeBSD. A very, very difficult mix; I wonder if I am well-prepared (enough).

[10:35] *** effbiai joined
[10:35] <AlexDaniel> do we even support arm64 properly right now?

[10:35] <LeCamarade> Before that, though, there is donations for Rakudo development, et cetera.

[11:36] <viki> We use the whirlpool metaphor....

[14:03] <ZzZombo> So... anybody? Please, I need your insight.

[14:04] <babydrop> heh, Google just called me... asking what I used their compute engine for. Told them Perl 6 compiler...

[14:04] <babydrop> like a badass

[14:07] <ZzZombo> Yes, because the previous time I tried to bring this topic, I got turned down, because apparently everything was thought of, and that P6 has is vastly superior to other languages.

[14:08] * babydrop glances at "this class hierarchy"

[14:09] <babydrop> Well, I disagree, the previous time you brought it up, you got a nice, long blog post saying that OO are about passing messages around and that you should think about messages for and the class hierarchy will pop out out of it.

[14:10] <babydrop> But what you have in that gist is two classes with methods like set_name and set_count

[14:10] *** avalokite joined
[14:10] <pmurias> ZzZombo: yes, that was the case ;)

[14:11] <ZzZombo> babydrop, I take it as you missed I stripped it down?

[14:11] <ZzZombo> so then tell me what should I do?

[14:11] <babydrop> ZzZombo: and someone already mentioned roles

[14:12] <babydrop> m: role Meow { has $!private-business = 42; }; class Foos does Meow { method meow { $!private-business } }.meow.say

[14:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´Cannot look up attributes in a Foos type object‚ê§  in method meow at <tmp> line 1‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[14:12] <babydrop> m: role Meow { has $!private-business = 42; }; class Foos does Meow { method meow { $!private-business } }.new.meow.say

[14:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[14:13] <ZzZombo> and the bit about them that I don't really understand is

[14:14] <ZzZombo> m: role R { has $!a='foo' };role R2 { has $!a='bar' };class A does R {method m{put $!a}};class B is A does R2 {method n{put $!a}};B.new.m;B.new.n;

[14:14] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´foo‚ê§bar‚ê§¬ª

[14:14] <ZzZombo> how it's supposed to work in cases like that.

[14:14] * babydrop doesn't see what the case is about

[14:14] <ZzZombo> I just don't really understand them.

[14:15] <babydrop> roles get inlined into your class

[14:15] <ZzZombo> I tried to experiment wit them and got confusing results like ^

[14:15] <ZzZombo> with*

[14:15] <babydrop> So above, your class A still has role R in it, but class has its own $!a coming from R2

[14:16] <babydrop> *but class B

[14:18] <babydrop> m: class A { has $!a = 'foo'; method m { put $!a } }; class B { has $!a = 'bar'; method m { put $!a }; B.new.m; B.new.A::m

[14:20] <babydrop> ZzZombo: ^ there. does that make more sence?

[14:21] <ZzZombo> yea

[14:21] <babydrop> ZzZombo: both classes have their own $!a with different value and you get different value depending on whose class's method you call

[14:21] <ZzZombo> but what's this *m thing

[14:21] <babydrop> same with your role example. 

[14:21] <babydrop> .* method call calls the method on all classes in the MRO

[14:22] <babydrop> so it calls B's m, then A's m

[14:22] <perlpilot> ZzZombo: There's also .?meth  which I find useful and you may too.  It's like "call meth if it exists"

[14:22] *** wamba left

[14:29] <babydrop> IMO the mistake you're making is having the assumption that subclases must have privilidged access to ancestor's private guts

[14:29] <moritz> cygx: right, make it a public attribute

[14:30] <moritz> anyone can subclass your class, so it must be a stable API and documented anyway

[14:31] <ZzZombo> But what if I wanna have my own TWEAK, for example, and also the one from the role?

[14:32] <cygx> that's smelly

[14:33] <babydrop> That's where jnthn's article comes in about thinking of messages in OO :)

[14:34] <cygx> rename is a perfectly fine message

[14:35] <cygx> the issue is a failure to express certain relationships without breaking encapsulation

[14:35] *** cdg left
[14:35] <babydrop> It may be, but why is it in a subclass? :)

[14:38] <cygx> babydrop: having MutableVersion inherit from ImmutableVersion can be useful

[14:39] <pmurias> cygx: if you want to break encapsulation you have to use trusts

[14:39] <babydrop> cygx: well, we have List/Array, Map/Hash, Set/SetHash, Bag/BagHash, Mix/MixHash in core.... as mutable complements to the immutable ones. Do they have the issue you describe?

[14:40] <pmurias> if class B was aware that class was using a Named role it would be break encapsulation

[14:45] <cygx> think about it this way: there are internal methods, infrastructural methods and interface methods

[14:45] <cygx> subclasses may require access to infrastructural methods, so in p6 they have to be promoted to the interface

[14:46] *** cdg left

[14:59] <ZzZombo> cygx: yes, I'm still not sold on that protected visibility is bad and therefore P6 is fine w/o it.

[15:00] <ZzZombo> that exactly why it was invented.

[15:03] *** seatek left
[15:04] <babydrop> What's protected visibility?

[15:04] <pmurias> only subclasses can access it

[15:04] <babydrop> If your subclass is using my $!name, that means I can't rename it something else willy nilly.

[15:05] <babydrop> Without breaking that subclass. That's why it's private

[15:05] <moritz> aka "you have to wear a funny yellow hat to see my privates"

[15:05] <babydrop> hheh

[15:06] <pmurias> babydrop: protected ones are not privates just, "it's public but you shouldn't use it on a whim, so we add an arbitary restriction"

[15:06] <babydrop> :/

[15:06] <cygx> in Java, funny hat means subclass and/or same package

[15:06] <moritz> forcing people who *really* need to write subclasses, instead of using a more appropriate relationship

[15:07] <moritz> forcing people who *really* need to access the attribute to write subclasses, instead of using a more appropriate relationship

[15:07] <moritz> that's what I meant

[15:07] <cygx> that's why if I were to design an OO system, I'd invert the trust relationship

[15:07] <cygx> "on request, give me access to stuff that you deem infrastructural"

[15:08] <pmurias> that breaks encapsulation

[15:08] <moritz> cygx: isn't that exactly what 'trusts' does? The author of the subclass requests access, and you trust it in the parent class

[15:08] <cygx> so does slapping an "is rw" on things to make my example code work

[15:09] <cygx> moritz: no, because it requires the truster to know about all trustees, instead of marking things accessible to anyone who requests access

[15:10] <babydrop> cygx: I think you took my version of your example too literally. You don't "slap" `is rw`. You design proper interface.

[15:10] *** eisen74 left
[15:10] <moritz> cygx: I don't understand what benefits the "requesting access" step gives if it's granted automatically, always

[15:11] *** g4 left
[15:11] <pmurias> seperates the clean suggested API from the dirty infrastructual methods?

[15:11] <cygx> moritz: it's granted on request and keeps the public API clean

[15:11] <cygx> pmurias: exactly

[15:13] <babydrop> cygx: but then nothing is private? Or are you proposing an "it's their own dumb fault" as a response for anyone who uses ancestor's privates willy-nilly, when their code breaks all of a sudden?

[15:14] <cygx> no, you have to be declare which privates to make accessible on request, instead of who can touch them (as is the current approach)

[15:15] <cygx> s/to be/to/

[15:16] <pmurias> cygx: the ones that are accessible on request are not privates

[15:16] <babydrop> Then they no longer privates. I can't change them without breaking someone's code.

[15:16] <pmurias> cygx: you could use a naming convention

[15:17] <cygx> pmurias: indeed, cf https://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2016-11-30#i_13655193

[15:18] <babydrop> And I bet such a thing can be done with a trait on a method

[15:19] <babydrop> So, in return to ZzZombo not buying things, I'm not buying that this paradigm is impossible in Perl 6 or that the system defeats itself or whatever that gist said.

[15:21] <ZzZombo> but nobody has shown a way to do so, did they? The suggested workaround to hack into class internals and trust subclasses this way is dirty and dosn't allow for selective exposure of certain members only.

[15:22] <babydrop> ZzZombo: so that somehow means it's impossible?

[15:22] <babydrop> ZzZombo: I'd show, but I have X amount of other things to take care of.

[15:22] <babydrop> ZzZombo: or rather, I'd try to make an `is protected` trait. I have no guarantee it works, since I don't know traits.

[15:23] <babydrop> And it'd install a check on a normally-public method to croak unless the class asked for protected  attributes

[15:23] <cygx> another approach besides noming convention: https://gist.github.com/cygx/a3de36abd398431c6e8513f13bd619e4

[15:23] <babydrop> or methods. And that would be obtained from caller() on a method that must be called to obtain access to prootected stuff

[15:24] <babydrop> callframe I mean

[15:28] <ZzZombo> https://docs.perl6.org/type/$AMPERSAND$QUESTION_MARKBLOCK is dead link on https://docs.perl6.org/type/CallFrame

[15:28] <babydrop> m: class A { method trustme ($who) { trusts $who }; method !meow { say "meow" } }; class B is A { BEGIN A.trustme(B); method meow { self!A::meow } }

[15:29] <babydrop> dunoo how to make it work or whatever

[15:29] <babydrop> And we can make our own metaclasses, I'm sure we can do something like that.

[15:30] <babydrop> Oh, I guess this is different from what I originally said.

[15:31] <ZzZombo> That would be useful if you could arbitrarily attach a different one to a type. I've found no such way though.

[15:47] * jnthn doesn't even know if Perl 5 has those...

[15:47] <babydrop> [Coke]: yeah, reminds me of Perl 5 too... but I don't really know what he'll write about

[15:47] <jnthn> I mean, I figure it's about `my %hash{Mu}`

[15:47] <jnthn> That is, hashes with object keys

[15:47] <babydrop> jnthn: the most common way to make an object in Perl 5 is to `bless` a hash :)

[15:47] <jnthn> That was my first guess anyway :)

[15:48] <jnthn> babydrop: Sure, but I don't think I've ever called that an object hash ;)

[15:48] <babydrop> true :)

[15:48] <jnthn> Maybe a hash object but... :)

[15:49] <cygx> pmurias: how is that a problem for my use case? the inheritance chain is known statically

[15:50] <ZzZombo> babydrop: that still lacks selectiveness. You trust all or nothing, so it doesn't emulate protected access very well.

[15:51] *** user9 joined

[15:52] <babydrop> ZzZombo: in the example above yeah

[15:54] <babydrop> ZzZombo: but I think it should be possible to make a trait that you mark methods with. Methods that in your code you'll write as public.

[16:39] <babydrop> So what's `write` access? Does that mean anyone in P6 org can push to it?

[17:12] <[Coke]> babydrop: should perl6/web-rakudo be under rakudo/ ? probably just a stylistic thing.

[17:13] <babydrop> .ask pmichaud any way we could touch base on rakudo.org maintenance? Could a person be given a sudo or something along those lines? We need HTTPs, upgraded Wordpress, and upgraded `php` + upgraded something else too, I'm sure

[17:13] <yoleaux> babydrop: I'll pass your message to pmichaud.

[21:24] *** TEttinger joined
[21:24] <MilkmanDan> Any word on the new Camel Book?

[21:26] <[Coke]> nope

[21:38] *** ChoHag joined
[21:39] <dudz> oh nice, almost there MilkmanDan 

[21:40] <dudz> though not enough backers

[21:40] <dudz> but with the monetary we can get started i reckon, keep our community small

[21:40] <MilkmanDan> dudz: There is time to get more. :)

[21:40] <dudz> :)

[21:41] <dudz> once something gets big it must be abandoned anyway

[21:41] <dudz> amazon, microsoft, google.

[21:41] * [Coke] wonders why building the docs generates so many duplicated path warnings.

[21:42] <[Coke]> Do we want to avoid duplication (fix the problem avoid the warning) or do we not care (don't emit the warning)

[21:43] <babydrop> dudz, but those are evil corporations, not ideas :)

[21:43] <dudz> :)

[21:47] *** cygx left

[21:47] <kyclark> I would expect the answer to this to be 1:

[21:47] <kyclark> m: put ((1,2)).elems

[21:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[21:47] <kyclark> While this would be 2:

[21:47] <timotimo> extra parenthesis doesn't change anything

[21:47] <kyclark> m: put ((1,2), (3,4)).elems

[21:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´2‚ê§¬ª

[21:48] <timotimo> m: put ((1,2),).elems

[21:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[21:48] <timotimo> ^- that's what you want

[21:48] <kyclark> Ah, hmm, OK.

[21:48] <kyclark> I‚Äôm struggling with turing a list of lists (tuples, really) into a hash

[21:49] <kyclark> Backing up, I have a two-column file that I want to ‚Äòfile‚Äô.IO.lines.map(*.split(/\t/) -> hash

[21:49] <kyclark> But I have to .flat.pairup to make it work. Seems overkill.

[21:49] <kyclark> Any suggestions?

[21:50] *** bjz joined
[21:50] <timotimo> hm, you really need to do the pairup? i thought a flat list of values coerced to a hash gives you key, value, key, value, ...

[21:50] <timotimo> but it could be .flat doesn't do enough and you have to .list or something

[21:50] <kyclark> No, you‚Äôre right. That works.

[21:51] *** itaipu left
[21:51] <kyclark> So that‚Äôs the best way, then?

[21:51] <jnthn> m: my %h = flat "a\t1\nb\t2\n".lines.map(*.split(/\t/)); say %h.perl

[21:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´{:a("1"), :b("2")}‚ê§¬ª

[21:51] <timotimo> you can split on two different separators

[21:51] <timotimo> with a single call, i mean

[21:52] <kyclark> Can you show?

[21:52] <timotimo> oh, also: it'll be a thousand times faster to split on "\t" instead of /\t/

[21:53] <kyclark> Noted.

[21:53] <timotimo> m: my %h = flat "a\t1\nb\t2\n".split(("\t", "\n")); say %h.perl

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´X::Hash::Store::OddNumber exception produced no message‚ê§  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[21:53] <timotimo> m: my %h = flat "a\t1\nb\t2\n".chomp.split(("\t", "\n")); say %h.perl

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´{:a("1"), :b("2")}‚ê§¬ª

[21:53] <timotimo> m: my %h = flat "a\t1\nb\t2\n".split(("\t", "\n"), :skip-empty); say %h.perl

[21:53] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´{:a("1"), :b("2")}‚ê§¬ª

[21:53] <timotimo> take your pick

[21:54] <[Coke]> GAH. doc build is soooooooooooo slow

[21:54] <kyclark> Is it better than ‚Äúlines‚Äù?

[21:54] <timotimo> no

[21:54] <timotimo> it might be better than lines + split, though

[21:54] <kyclark> ‚Äúlines‚Äù seems to self-document

[21:54] <timotimo> that's right

[21:54] <kyclark> Since it‚Äôs a small file, I‚Äôll stick with lines + split

[21:54] <kyclark> Thanks.

[21:54] <[Coke]> it seems like every time I try to do some doc stuff I end up yak shaving.

[21:54] <timotimo> nothing about that split call says "the \t and \n will always take turns"

[21:57] <babydrop> Is flat even needed?

[21:57] <timotimo> oh

[21:57] <timotimo> not with the split invocation, i don't think

[21:57] <babydrop> m: my %h = "a\t1\nb\t2\n".words; say %h.perl

[21:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´{:a("1"), :b("2")}‚ê§¬ª

[21:57] * babydrop shrugs

[21:57] <timotimo> well, with .words your code will b0rk if there's multiple words in a single field

[21:59] <babydrop> heh

[22:01] <babydrop> oh, right, it's none, not not :)

[22:01] <babydrop> But it just autothreads, not uses it as a matcher

[22:02] <timotimo> you mean none, not not

[22:02] <timotimo> oh

[22:02] <timotimo> you noticed

[22:02] <timotimo> the result ought to be funny, though. one string split by one sep, the other by the other

[22:03] <babydrop> nah, it just finds the stuff

[22:03] <babydrop> m: dd "a\t1\nb\t2\n".comb: none("\n", "\t");

[22:03] <camelia> rakudo-moar 843a6b: OUTPUT¬´none(("\n", "\n").Seq, ("\t", "\t").Seq)‚ê§¬ª

[22:26] <dalek> mu: b6f9046 | (Zoffix Znet)++ | misc/perl6advent-2016/schedule:

[22:26] <dalek> mu: Add another zofspot

[22:27] <babydrop> Wanted to write that for perl6.party for ages, but always put it off :) Should be neat

[22:27] <timotimo> sounds neat, yeah

[22:27] <timotimo> will you be using PortMIDI for that?

[22:27] <babydrop> Audio::MIDI::Note (which uses it under the hood)

[22:28] <babydrop> Gonna try to make it play through my keyboard and then record me on guitars with Perl 6 doing the drums :D

[22:28] <babydrop> (hence the title :P)

[22:28] <babydrop> *keyboard as in musical instrument

[22:28] <timotimo> :D

[22:28] <timotimo> "through" your keyboard, as in: the keyboard receives midi and synthesizes sound?

[22:29] <babydrop> yeah

[22:29] <timotimo> understood

[22:29] <timotimo> my keyboard is midi-only, so my laptop synthesizes for me

[22:29] <timotimo> not that i have anything interesting i can input into the keyboard yet

[22:30] <babydrop> As for the topic... dunno. I'd personally would read it if you wrote something about MoarVM guts :)
