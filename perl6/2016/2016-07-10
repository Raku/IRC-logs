[11:00] <tbrowder> mornin' (where I am) mst!

[11:01] <tbrowder> is there any way, in nqp, to return or modify two or more arrays external to a subroutine?  I want to avoid file scope vars but don't see how to do it

[11:02] <tbrowder> as far as i know all args to an nqp sub are read-only

[11:03] <moritz> they aren't deeply immutable

[11:03] <moritz> you can't rebind them, but you can modify them

[11:03] <moritz> so you cannot do  sub f($x) { $x := ... }

[11:03] <psch> nqp-m: sub foo(@a) { @a[0] := "bar" }; my @b := ["baz"]; foo(@b); say(@b[0])

[11:03] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT«bar␤»

[11:03] <moritz> but you *can* do sub f(@a, @b) { @a[0] := 42 }

[11:05] <tbrowder> ah! okay; can you append to them by increasing the array index by 1 in the assignment?

[11:05] <moritz> or you can call nqp::push(@a, "new elem")

[11:05] <psch> nqp-m: sub foo(@a) { @a[1823] := "bar" }; my @b := ["baz"]; foo(@b); say(@b[1823])

[11:05] <camelia> nqp-moarvm: OUTPUT«bar␤»

[11:05] <tbrowder> thanks,  moritz!

[13:40] <finanalyst> can anyone here help me with proc? I can't quite get output back from stderr

[13:40] <nebuchadnezzar> kaare_: thanks a lot

[13:40] *** snarkyboojum left
[13:44] <moritz> finanalyst: you need to run with :err, and then .err.slurp-rest or something like that

[13:45] <finanalyst> moritz: I'll try that. I was also looking at the documentation, and read about :merge. But I cant find a way to use it.

[13:46] <finanalyst> Typically, I am using it in unit tests with: shell 

[13:46] <finanalyst> shell 'myprog --flag ', :out, :merge

[13:47] <finanalyst> I was expecting to have output directed by myprog into Stderr to be merged into stdout

[13:51] <finanalyst> moritz: tried using .err.slurp-rest as you suggested. It worked. Documentation on proc could be improved to hint at that.

[13:52] <moritz> finanalyst: please submit a PR for the docs :-)

[13:52] *** iH2O left
[13:52] <moritz> and to be fair, the docs do show an example with run(... :out).out.slurp-rest

[14:01] *** BenGoldberg joined
[14:08] *** wamba left
[14:18] <finanalyst> moritz: I used the example of run( ... :out).out.slurp-rest , but it was not obvious to me from the documentation that run( ... :err).err.slurp-rest would work until you hinted at it

[14:19] <finanalyst> The documentation also says that setting :merge to true will redirect stderr to stdout. But I havent worked out yet how to do that.

[14:21] <finanalyst> for example, when I use $proc=shell  'some_command', :err, :merge; in a test.t to be used with prove, I get a time-out failure.

[14:21] *** MasterDuke joined

[16:48] <hankache> has anyone in #perl6 ever touched pygments https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main ?

[16:49] <hankache> it would be great if we could update the list of built-in types and methods and keywords/ops

[16:51] <parabolize> the perl6 lexer was made by hoelzro

[16:51] <parabolize> the quoting could be improved too.

[16:51] <parabolize> I was trying and failing

[16:52] <hankache> yup

[16:52] <hankache> .seen hoelzro

[16:52] <yoleaux> I saw hoelzro 8 Jul 2016 20:19Z in #perl6: <hoelzro> Zoffix: are you still seeing Linenoise build failures? it works for me on both zef and panda

[16:55] <gfldex> automatic syntax highlighter for docs

[16:55] <parabolize> there is highlighting in emacs and vim

[16:55] <moritz> we could also use Text::VimColor

[16:55] <parabolize> they don't do any better

[16:55] <parabolize> haven't looked at that

[16:56] <moritz> vim syntax hilighting for Perl 6 is mostly pretty good

[16:57] <hankache> moritz does it highlight say "bla bla bla {@a.elems}" correctly?

[16:57] <hankache> or say "bla bla bla @a.elems()" ?

[16:58] <parabolize> yes

[16:59] <parabolize> I think it was when I started adding a lot of adverbs

[16:59] <hankache> it can only use pygments and a couple

[16:59] <hankache> and highlight.js

[16:59] <hankache> and another ruby library

[17:00] <hankache> at the moment pygments is my only hope
