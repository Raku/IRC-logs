[00:08] <labster> It's only a shallow clone.  Or so it says in the docs.

[00:08] <notviki> labster: I mean .deepmap with *.clone

[00:09] <labster> Oh interesting.  I mean this is all a lot of work for what will be a somewhat common use case.

[00:34] <[Coke]> anyone have any pointers about getting utf8 to work in a tmux connection?

[00:35] <[Coke]> before I start tmux on irc.p6c.org, I can use utf8 - after tmux is started, nothing.

[00:37] <sjn> [Coke]: I'm using tmux 2.1 and have no problems with utf8

[00:38] <sjn> (tmux -V shows the version)

[00:39] * sjn uses nb_NO.utf8 as locale, and othetwise a recent linux

[00:40] <sjn> [Coke]: what does it look like when it's not working?

[00:40] <[Coke]> ah. irc.p6c.org is only on 1.9

[00:41] <[Coke]> sjn;it just doesn't send the unicode through. Here's an ellipsis:

[00:41] <[Coke]> here: 

[00:48] <sjn> here's mine: …

[00:53] <Herby_> I keep fumbling with p6 regexes.  If I have a string of names, "NAME=Bob\nNAME=Carl\nNAME=Sally", how do I go about getting an array of (Bob, Carl, Sally)?

[00:56] <TEttinger> I'm curious too, Herby_

[00:57] <TEttinger> I know there's a fair amount of difference between standard PCRE-style regexes and Perl6's regexes/parsers/grammars

[00:58] *** cibs left
[00:58] <Herby_> TEttinger, yeah my regex knowledge is shaky at best and I stumble even more when trying to use p6 regexes

[01:01] <timotimo> oh

[01:01] <camelia> rakudo-moar 0db081: OUTPUT«("Bob", "Carl", "Sally")␤»

[01:01] <Herby_> \o/

[01:02] <Herby_> two questions:  why the '< >' around the capture group, and how would I push that into an array for later use

[01:02] <timotimo> it's actually the <( thing and the )> thing

[01:02] <timotimo> it has essentially the same effect as if you put the stuff before it into a lookbehind and the stuff after it into a lookahead

[01:02] <timotimo> though i could imagine it's faster

[01:04] <Herby_> m: my @names = "NAME=Bob\nNAME=Carl\nNAME=Sally".comb(/ '=' <( .*? )> $$ /); say @names;

[01:04] *** leah2 left
[01:04] <TEttinger> with more traditional regexes in Clojure I'd do: (re-seq #"(?<=NAME=)\S+" "NAME=Bob\nNAME=Carl\nNAME=Sally")

[01:04] <Herby_> i was trying to use m :g//

[01:04] <TEttinger> not sure how perl6 does lookbehind

[01:04] <timotimo> it's <?after foo>

[01:04] <TEttinger> thanks

[01:05] <Herby_> thanks, timotimo 

[01:05] <TEttinger> is .comb short for something or is it like "combing the desert for clues"

[01:05] <timotimo> my regex doesn't account for spaces, though

[01:05] <timotimo> it's the latter, TEttinger 

[01:08] <Herby_> timotimo: one more question for you if you're feeling adventurous

[01:08] <timotimo> sure

[01:08] <Herby_> if I have the string ""NAME=Bob\nAGE=23\nNAME=Carl\nAGE=31\nNAME=Sally\nAGE=47", how would I return tuples of (NAME,AGE)

[01:08] <timotimo> adventure is my second middle name

[01:09] <Herby_> so [(Bob,23),(Carl,31),(Sally,47)]

[01:09] <Herby_> or something similar

[01:09] <timotimo> just a sec

[01:09] <Herby_> kk

[01:09] <timotimo> are name and age always in the right order?

[01:10] <Herby_> yep. always NAME, and their AGE on the next line

[01:10] <timotimo> well, that's easy then

[01:10] <timotimo> m: "NAME=Bob\nAGE=23\nNAME=Carl\nAGE=31\nNAME=Sally\nAGE=47".comb(/ '=' <( .*? )> $$ /).rotor(2 => 2).perl.say

[01:17] <Herby_> i have a small python script that parses text for me and utilizes re.findall(), i'd like to swap it out for a p6 script

[01:17] <timotimo> well, findall is basically comb, so ... :P

[01:17] <notviki> Herby_: so swap it out? Why do you need it to be regex only?

[01:17] <timotimo> you can also give :match to comb to get match objects instead of only the strings

[01:17] <timotimo> then it'll behave a lot more like m:g

[19:24] <arnsholt> Not to my knowledge

[19:25] <notviki> I was gonna... but got sidetracked as always.

[19:25] <arnsholt> Might be possible to jury-rig something from NativeCall though. How different is the code generated from C conventions?

[19:26] <notviki> Well, you can tell rust to compile a C lib and use that from NativeCall

[19:26] <notviki> Though the approach looked somewhat fragile last time someone tried that in the channel.... we concluded rust's ownership was causing issues 

[19:27] <notviki> Like, if you touch owned things from Perl 6 it segfaults instead of politely refusing to work.

[19:27] <mst> pmurias: somebody's done rust-for-XS

[19:27] <notviki> :o

[19:27] <mst> pmurias: so you can always go via Inline::Perl5

[21:18] <moritz> mr_ron: the do block doesn't decontainerize its return value

[21:18] <moritz> so it doesn't return 4, but the variable $x, which is (correctly) reset to its original value immediately after block exit

[21:21] <mr_ron> I sort of understand but wonder if there might not be some ambiguity.  Is the evaluated $x "my $x" or "temp $x" and why?

[21:24] <mr_ron> Wait ... starting to understand ...

[21:24] *** Axord joined
[21:24] <moritz> there is only one $x in that example

[21:24] <moritz> temp just temporary replaces the value

[21:34] <mr_ron> A little unintuitive to me but understandably correct with explanation ... thank you

[21:37] *** hankache joined
[21:38] <moritz> it's unintuitive because you write to and read from the same variable within one expression

[21:38] <moritz> even if no temp is involved, that can be very surprising

[23:01] <samcv> how am i supposed to highlight two heredocs starting on the same line?

[23:01] <samcv> er and what does that even do. do they overlap?

[23:05] <samcv> it's kind of ugly tbh. just

[23:14] <samcv> notviki, well https://design.perl6.org/S02.html#Heredocs the S02 has it… not sure how i'm going to highlight this. maybe it's not possible. unless i like… idk it will be hard

[23:14] <notviki> samcv: I'd ignore that case. Anyone stupid enough to write such code deserves LTA highlighting :)

[23:14] <samcv> :)

[23:19] <notviki> Is there a reverse of `is pure`?

[23:20] <notviki> m: multi infix:<-> (Str $, Str $) { say "hi" }; say "start"; quietly "x" - "x"

[23:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar b306de: OUTPUT«hi␤start␤»

[23:20] <timotimo> if you don't put "is pure" on it, it won't be pure

[23:20] <timotimo> but i'd expect code that checks for purity to see if there's a method for pureness and whether that method returns 1 or not

[23:20] <notviki> Well, what if there an is pure on the proto? Can I mark one multi as not pure?

[23:21] <notviki> Basically, our proto for infix:<-> is pure, and that causes any of the custom user's infix:<->'s to be constant folded as well.

[23:21] <notviki> And (as above) produce undesirable results).

[23:23] <notviki> m: proto infix:<->(|) {*}; multi infix:<-> (Str $, Str $) { say "hi" }; say "start"; quietly "x" - "x"; say 42 - 42

[23:27] <notviki> At least there's a way to work aroun dit.

[23:29] <notviki> Well, if the docs have a section bragging about how you can expand core ops... it should mention the constant-foldiness

[23:43] <timotimo> we can have a second look before doing the constant folding to see if the proto is in the core setting but the candidate we're trying isn't
