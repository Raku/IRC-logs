[11:15] <notviki> FWIW, I wish we had the same solid, predictable plan for R* releases as for the compiler. i.e. every X-day people can expect an R* release.

[11:15] <notviki> It's the only user-facing release we have and when ever the core devs are confused about when the next release is gonna happen it just makes us look like we ain't got a clue

[11:16] *** _28_ria left

[12:40] <arnsholt> Given a sufficiently clever compiler, I guess

[12:40] <arnsholt> But that's a kind of error detection where there will always be holes

[12:40] <kaare_> "When the battle's lost and won"

[12:41] <kaare_> (sorry)

[12:41] <andreoss> also why it doesn't sugest .foo?

[12:42] <andreoss> arnsholt: so theoretically in a different perl6 compiler? 

[12:43] <jnthn> I expect we'll implement suggesting method names in Rakudo at some point.

[12:44] <jnthn> The sub/method distinction is an early-bound/late-bound distinction.

[12:45] <andreoss> can i have a some kind of strict methods which are always checked at compilation?

[12:45] <jnthn> Maybe with a module

[12:45] <jnthn> But late binding is part of the original definition of OO

[12:46] <jnthn> If you want early binding, don't do OO.

[12:47] <jnthn> (Somebody will surely some day implement an OO::LikeIt'sJavaAllOverAgain some day though. :)

[12:48] <jnthn> s:2nd/some day//

[12:49] <jnthn> Given method dispatch is itself overridable, and we've got things like FALLBACK, though, it's not going to be so simple.

[14:06] <jnthn> Oh...actually

[14:06] <jnthn> I think it has some interesting effects on .can

[14:06] <ufobat> what is .can? what do you mean?

[14:06] <jnthn> Since a method with FALLBACK can do anything

[14:06] <jnthn> .can is how we check if an object can perform a certain method

[18:02] <notviki> (sudo apt-get install libfreexl1; on my box)

[18:02] <loveperl> linux

[18:02] <notviki> heh, there are many linuxes :}

[18:03] <loveperl> yeah :D

[18:03] <tony-o> if you're on some debian flavor ^ that aptitude command should work

[18:03] <loveperl> I still have the same error

[18:05] <notviki> m: say $*VM.config<dll>

[18:05] <tailgate> How can I capture all strings between  [ ] in a string with a regex?

[18:05] <notviki> tailgate: what's a "string"?

[18:06] <tailgate> like foo[bar][baz] I want to get bar and baz

[18:06] <tony-o> is there ever going to be an escaped [ or ] ?

[18:06] <lucasb> maybe / '[' (.*?) ']' /

[18:07] <notviki> m: "foo[bar][baz]".comb(/'[' <( <-[[]>+ )> ']'/).say

[18:08] <notviki> loveperl: well, it can't find the lib

[18:09] <notviki> loveperl: which one did you install?

[18:09] <notviki> lucasb: yeah

[18:09] <lucasb> notviki: your examples made it clear, thanks

[18:09] <loveperl> this panda install Parser::FreeXL::Native

[18:10] <notviki> loveperl: but it also needs the freexl C library to go with it. Did you install that?

[18:10] <loveperl> no, how install?

[18:10] <lucasb> I would confirm that I've correctly installed the lib; find the lib file and patch the line Parser/FreeXL/Native.pm6#L5 in place

[18:10] <tony-o> what flavor or linux are you on?

[18:11] <tony-o> of

[18:11] <notviki> lucasb: are you sure that patch is needed? There's Build.pm that does stuff...

[18:11] <notviki> loveperl: what linux are you using?

[18:12] <loveperl> ubuntu 16.04

[18:12] <lucasb> notviki: nope, I'm not sure :) It just looks strange the path starts with './lib', but maybe that's how it's supposed to be

[18:12] <notviki> loveperl: what does      aptitude search libfreexl    give you?

[18:15] <notviki> loveperl: ok, now run this:  sudo apt-get install libfreexl1

[18:15] <notviki> loveperl: and then install the module with panda:  panda install Parser::FreeXL::Native

[18:15] <notviki> Then make a sacrifice to a deity of your choosing.... and stuff should work.

[18:16] <notviki> loveperl: did you do the sudo?   It's `sudo apt-get install libfreexl1` not `apt-get install libfreexl1`

[18:17] <notviki> loveperl: or do you have Synaptic open? Close it (or use it to install libfreexl1)

[18:25] <notviki> fuck you

[18:26] <tony-o> lol, what?

[18:26] <notviki> nothing :}

[18:27] <tony-o> almost have DB::ORM::Quicky doing joins

[18:27] * notviki gives `passwd` a couple of goes and moves on

[18:27] <loveperl> I already have it installed

[18:28] <notviki> loveperl: no idea then. Try some other module.

[18:28] <tony-o> loveperl: try the libfreexl-dev 

[18:28] <tony-o> loveperl: rather than libfreexl

[18:28] <tony-o> maybe also try zef install 

[18:30] <tailgate> okay, so what's the way to get the stuff not being captured ... i.e. if /'[' <( <-[[]>+ )> ']'/ captures bar baz in foo[bar][baz], how would I get foo?

[18:30] <notviki> tailgate: the way I showed you like 10 minutes ago?

[18:31] <loveperl> And I use the same bookstore

[18:31] <notviki> m: "foo[bar][baz]".comb(/'[' <( <-[[]>+ )> ']'/)[0].say

[18:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 9eed27: OUTPUT«bar␤»

[18:31] <notviki> tailgate: oh, sorry, misread

[18:31] <tailgate> lol

[18:31] <notviki> :)

[18:31] <tailgate> appreciated anyways

[18:32] <notviki> tailgate: well, what's "stuff not being captured"? Is it just the prefix before the bracketed stuff?

[18:32] <tailgate> well, foo[bar]baz should capture foo and baz in this case

[18:32] <tailgate> stuff NOT in btween a []

[18:33] <notviki> But capture how? would it be two separate captures of "foo" and "baz" or two separate of "foo[" and "]baz" or one string "foobaz" or one string "foo[]baz"?

[18:33] <loveperl> What other options are there to read an Excel?

[18:34] <notviki> loveperl: https://metacpan.org/pod/Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel

[18:34] <notviki> You can use it through Inline::Perl5

[18:34] *** stmuk joined
[18:34] <notviki> use Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel:from<Perl5>; my @data = Spreadsheet::DataFromExcel.new.load: "yourfile.xls"

[18:36] <tailgate> I think it should be a list of foo baz

[18:37] *** cognominal joined
[18:37] *** stmuk_ left
[18:37] <tailgate> so foo[bar]baz[bing]bong should be (foo, baz, bong)

[18:45] <yoleaux> 17:32Z <notviki> samcv: is doc/1061 ready to merge? Do we need to install anything on the server with the doc build? I see "you need node for this" comment... On the server npm -v gives 2.15.1; is that sufficient? Do we need anything else?

[18:45] <notviki> loveperl: https://gist.github.com/zoffixznet/2fc2aa2cfbabad6b9a4ea529f1774dbb

[18:45] <Xliff> tony-o: Good luck with DB::ORM::Quicky. I would love to be able to use JOINS without nasty SQL.

[18:45] <notviki> loveperl: that will build you latest Perl 5 and install cpanm command

[18:46] <notviki> loveperl: and then you can find pretty much any module on https://metacpan.org/ install it with `cpanm Some::Module` and then use it in Perl6 as `use Some::Module:from<Perl5>`

[18:46] <samcv> notviki well the commands to make it changed. See .travis.yml

[18:46] <samcv> But I think that node should work fine

[18:46] <notviki> loveperl: and the first command in that list installs perlbrew: https://perlbrew.pl/  it's an installer for Perl 5

[18:48] <samcv> But it is ready yeah. Though let me try doing a clean build on my laptop before you merge

[18:48] <notviki> samcv: so is it ready to merge or are you still tweaking it?

[18:48] <samcv> Just in case

[18:48] <notviki> OK :)

[18:48] <tony-o> Xliff: maybe you'd like to provide some feedback, here is the route i'm going right now (runs to gist.github)

[20:00] * notviki tries using a bong instead

[20:00] <samcv> hmm. not sure why

[20:01] <samcv> crashing on the spurting? weird

[20:01] <samcv> travis used to get broken pipe

[20:01] <samcv> but that was because highlights wasn't getting installed

[20:01] <samcv> you _did_ run make init-highlights right?

[20:02] <samcv> i'll be back a little later, but will check my phone periodically

[20:02] <notviki> I'm almost positive I'm sure I did.

[20:03] <samcv> run it again tho

[20:03] <samcv> running it again dosen't hurt and just ensures it's up to date or properly installed

[20:03] <notviki> seems not the spurt but one of the args... p2h maybe

[20:03] <notviki> p2h()

[20:03] * notviki debugs moar

[20:04] <notviki> yeah, make init-highlights was run. Ran it again and it told me "already exists"

[20:05] <notviki> uuuuuu... It's also failing with this here: https://docs.perl6.org/build-log/build-2016-12-21T19:55+0000.log

[20:06] <notviki> maybe my bash-foo is too weak. I added it as this line: https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/util/update-and-sync#L33

[20:08] <samcv> If you run: echo htmlify | ./highlights/highlightfilenamefromstdin.coffee

[20:14] <samcv> Thats the issue. But that echo... Commanf i told you is the best way to ensure it is installed. Brb lunch

[20:14] <[Coke]> is highlights live on master, or is notviki just testing to see if it works on the build machine?

[20:15] <notviki> [Coke]: it's merged but we can't get it to build

[20:15] <notviki> [Coke]: the first error is this: https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/util/update-and-sync#L33

[20:15] <notviki> [Coke]: I mean this: https://docs.perl6.org/build-log/build-2016-12-21T19:55+0000.log

[20:15] <notviki> And I'm unsure if that's just me messing up the bash command in https://github.com/perl6/doc/blob/master/util/update-and-sync#L33

[20:16] <notviki> It used to be `make html` but now it got two `make blah` in  ity

[20:23] <[Coke]> but not a clean copy, apparently.

[20:23] <notviki> on latest commit

[20:23] <notviki> Oh you mean on the one that's in the actual build

[20:23] <[Coke]> and do you get the same error message when you run "git pull" from the command line in that dir?

[20:24] <[Coke]> Yes, the one in the directory shown just before the error message on this page: https://docs.perl6.org/build-log/build-2016-12-21T19:55+0000.log

I know we had them before, but does `pod_to_pyg` in filename means it's still using the old pygments or whatever it was for highlights?

[23:29] <notviki> .tell samcv your last commit fixed the build issue on doc/1061. Seems to be working, but it's printing a toooooon of `duplicated path in ....-pod_to_pyg.pod` warnings. I know we had them before, but does `pod_to_pyg` in filename means it's still using the old pygments or whatever it was for highlights? I set the doc build to use the new highlights now

[23:29] <yoleaux> notviki: I'll pass your message to samcv.

[23:40] <samcv> We probably want to make the html use one or the other css if we want to keep pygments as an option.

[23:42] <Xliff> tony-o: How does that example work?

[23:43] <Xliff> Because I see an AND with only one comparison

[23:43] <Xliff> And no EQU which is usually present in a join.

[23:47] <Xliff> tony-o: As for use cases, does DB::ORM::Quickly work with MySQL?

[23:47] <Xliff> I might be able to come up with a few. :)
