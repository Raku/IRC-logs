[01:15] <timotimo> we don't have support for long double in moar

[01:15] <scott> cppreference says "long double - extended precision floating point type. Does not necessarily map to types mandated by IEEE-754. Usually 80-bit x87 floating point type on x86 and x86-64 architectures."

[01:15] <geekosaur> yep

[01:16] *** pierre_ left
[01:17] <timotimo> there's also long long double

[01:17] <timotimo> but on MSVC++, a long double is 64bit

[01:17] <timotimo> unless you give it some flag

[01:18] <scott> I've never heard of long long double

[01:18] <scott> only float/double/long double and char/short/int/long/long long

[01:19] <timotimo> i've been fascinated by extra-long floating point types for a few weeks

[01:20] <geekosaur> long double is nonstandard, as cppreference implied. msvc "supported" it as an alias for double, then finally when they added their own extended precision double had to invent long long double

[01:20] <scott> lol

[01:20] <timotimo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_precision

[01:21] <geekosaur> (msvc's behavior there caused much gnashing of teeth among numeric methods types, because it silently didn't provide the precision everyone expected)

[01:21] <scott> actually, I still can't find google results for "long long double", even MSVC-related

[03:35] <ugexe> you are declaring the signature and delegating somewhere

[03:35] <scott> it also works without the `*`

[03:36] <scott> as far as I can tell

[12:53] <yoleaux> 23 Sep 2016 22:22Z <jnthn> nine: About your question about wrap of a core method in backlog, you'd better stick "no precompilation" on your code if you do that, since it's a monkey patch and those don't compose under precomp.

[12:58] <hackedNODE> Trying to hit ^ that one

[12:59] <psch> i think that candidate is for the benefit of non-CORE Numeric types in the first place?

[12:59] <psch> 'cause we probably want narrower candidates for everything that we already know about

[12:59] <hackedNODE> I see.

[13:01] <hackedNODE> How can a non-core Numeric work there then? As in, how can it be used in multiplication with standard ops and still get right value? From what I see above seems like it'll just go into an infiniloop

[14:00] <timotimo> that usually happens when you try to .say("foobar") on a handle, but it ended up not giving you one

[15:26] <TimToady> well, :{} is gonna make a hash or a closure for the value, which is odd

[15:27] *** domidumont left
[15:28] <TimToady> :[] actually makes a list, but it knows it can handle a list, especially when you need multiple delims

[15:29] <TimToady> as for :(), I have no idea what it's thinking there, since there's nothing to invoke

[15:29] <TimToady> well, no, it's not invoking, so those are just grouping parens, like foo => (1,2,3)

[15:30] <TimToady> so probably should work just like :[]

[18:33] <grondilu> Hello #perl6

[18:33] <hackedNODE> \o

[18:33] <grondilu> off-topic:  SpaceX's announcement about their mars plan  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YxNYiyALg

[18:33] <hackedNODE> lool

[18:33] <nwc10> grondilu++ # confirming my opinion about what off-topic is on-topic :-)

[18:34] <hackedNODE> So what's the plan? I can't watch anything.

[18:34] <nwc10> yes, I am wondering this too

[18:34] <nwc10> it's 4 minutes late

[18:35] <grondilu> while you wait you can watch this I guess:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qo78R_yYFA

[18:35] *** maybekoo2 joined
[18:35] <grondilu> it's their interplanetary vessel plan

[18:36] <grondilu> released an hour ago.

[18:37] <El_Che> I would watch if they put the US presidential candidates on it ;)

[18:37] <El_Che> or in :)

[18:37] <hackedNODE> or under...

[18:38] <hackedNODE> I don't know why Muricans complain about their candidates. You brought this on your own lol :)

[18:46] <hackedNODE> moritz: from what I understand, you don't submit repos to anywhere. You just tag Issues in any GitHub-hosted repo with "Hacktoberfest" label

[18:47] <hackedNODE> Which, sadly, excludes any of Rakudo's issues :/

[18:55] <moritz> why?

[18:55] <hackedNODE> Rakudo's issue tracker is disabled

[18:55] <hackedNODE> I mean, people can submit PRs, but we can't tag RT tickets with "Hacktoberfest" :)

[18:56] <moritz> oh, right

[18:56] <hackedNODE> Of course, we can enable it temporarily, open just some Hacktoberfest issues, and then close it at the end

[18:56] * hackedNODE isn't sure that's worth the effort

[18:57] <moritz> no, we should just do it for other repos
