[02:52] <geekosaur> I don't think it's available at all?

[02:53] <FreezerburnV> When did that change? I used to be able to modify it in a previous version. Hm

[02:53] <geekosaur> with the switch to CompUnitRepos, shortly before 6.c release

[02:54] <FreezerburnV> I want to have perl6 search the directory a script is being run from for modules

[02:54] <FreezerburnV> Gotcha

[02:54] <FreezerburnV> What's the correct way to do what I just said in 6.c then?

[02:54] <FreezerburnV> And what's a CompUnitRepo?

[02:54] <geekosaur> http://design.perl6.org/S22.html#Distributions%2C_Recommendations%2C_Delivery_and_Installation

[02:55] * geekosaur does not know the answer to your questions, sadly

[02:57] <FreezerburnV> I don't think I have the mental capacity to read through and actually understand all that right now, too tired

[02:58] <FreezerburnV> If someone has a quick example of adding a directory to search for perl6 modules, I would appreciate it. Otherwise I'll have to work on this later

[03:03] <geekosaur> this is usually the wrong tome of day, I'm afraid; many of the key folks are in Europe

[03:04] <geekosaur> *time of day

[03:04] <FreezerburnV> Ah, gotcha

[03:05] *** kaare_ left
[03:07] <MadcapJake> FreezerburnV: my @files = find( :dir('.'), :type('file'), :name(rx!(\.pm6?)$!) )».IO.flat.list;

[03:10] <FreezerburnV> MadcapJake: I might have phrased my request badly. I want to tell perl6 a new directory to search for modules when useing them

[03:10] <FreezerburnV> Currently it does not seem to search '.', sadly

[03:11] <FreezerburnV> (which seems odd, considering that one of the most common cases is possibly that you'll be useing your own modules...?)

[03:11] <MadcapJake> You're right, it doesn't search `.` it only searches the locations given in the error.

[03:12] <MadcapJake> You could try `use lib '.'`  don't know if that will work

[03:13] <FreezerburnV> That works, thanks! Don't remember that being documented anywhere, but I haven't done anything with perl6 for a bit, so I don't know if documentation has been updated or not

[03:13] <FreezerburnV> What is that doing?

[03:18] <skids> FreezerBurnV: "use lib" sets the search path, but only inside the current lexical scope.

[03:18] <FreezerburnV> Ah, interesting. Duly noted

[03:18] <FreezerburnV> Thanks

[03:22] *** kid51 left
[03:23] <FreezerburnV> Also: How do I build a .moar version of a perl6 module ahead of time? (or whatever the windows version uses, I think I saw a different file ending when compiling with rakudobrew)

[03:23] <FreezerburnV> (I could be completely wrong considering moar is the underlying vm...)

[03:25] <MadcapJake> don't know anything about that but i think you're just thinking of moarvm's files.

[03:25] *** AW3i joined
[03:25] <skids> On the latest version they are compiled and stored compiled automatically.  So just using it once should do it.  You'll notice the first run after touching a file is slower.

[03:26] *** aigan left
[03:26] <FreezerburnV> Ah, yeah, ok I'm seeing that now

[03:26] *** aigan joined
[03:26] <FreezerburnV> Sorry, used to a previous version where it didn't do that and I had to manually do that if I wanted to run a script in less then 30 seconds :)

[03:26] <FreezerburnV> Looking forward to the future when compilation is faster!

[03:28] <MadcapJake> Some are quite fast already! But definitely looking forward to more speed improvements.

[03:29] <FreezerburnV> Native modules, at least, seem to take quite some time. SDL2::Raw takes greater than 10 seconds or so

[03:29] <MadcapJake> oh wow

[03:29] <FreezerburnV> Don't remember if the wrapper I'm working on was taking a decent chunk of time or not

[03:30] <FreezerburnV> I'm excited to figure out more about perl6 though, so I can (theoretically) make a really nice wrapper around SDL2 and OpenGl in a good perly style. I know little enough that I'm sure anything I make write now will seem somewhat barbaric at first

[03:31] <FreezerburnV> Hopefully I can actually get it done, put it out there, and have people who are much smarter than me whip it into much nicer shape

[03:31] <MadcapJake> Perl 6 is great in that a beginner can write nice clean code.  Then everyday you learn something new that streamlines or condenses your code.  It's actually quite fun to grow with!

[03:32] *** avs_ joined
[03:32] *** arlenik joined
[03:32] <FreezerburnV> That's what I seem to be seeing, and it's really exciting

[03:33] <awwaiid> FreezerburnV: use lib '.'; # works for me

[03:33] <awwaiid> oh, I didn't read that far ahead in the backlog, you got htat already

[03:33] <FreezerburnV> On a totally unrelated note: Do you know if there are plans to be able to package perl6 applications to be standalone in some way and deployable to someone who does not have it?

[03:33] <FreezerburnV> awwaiid: Yep, thanks though!

[03:34] <awwaiid> FreezerburnV: there are no immediate plans, but I think it is a wishlist item for sure

[03:34] <awwaiid> as in, I don't know of any particularly progressed examples of it

[03:34] <MadcapJake> well since rakudo is a compiler, i'm sure it's possible, just perhaps down the line somewhere

[03:34] <FreezerburnV> awwaiid, MadcapJake: Sweet

[03:34] *** avs__ left
[03:34] <awwaiid> also w/ jvm backend a .jar might be nice for some cases

[03:35] <MadcapJake> yeah that would be awesome too

[03:35] <FreezerburnV> I was assuming it wasn't available now, but knowing my rate of progress, by the time I want to deploy something I'm sure somethign will be available to package the end result

[03:35] <FreezerburnV> awwaiid: Fair enough

[03:35] *** avs__ joined
[03:36] <FreezerburnV> awwaiid: Though I'm pretty sure the JVM backend isn't as fully-developed as the MoarVM one...?

[03:36] <MadcapJake> Clojure and Ceylon both create war files that can be dropped into java servers very easily.  that would be really neat to see Perl 6 capable of doing too.

[03:37] <FreezerburnV> MadcapJake: That would be neat, though I'm much more interested in gamedev-type stuff. A war file would be much easier than that, I would assume

[03:37] *** Actualeyes left
[03:37] <arlenik> Does anyone know what % of the people who have worked on Perl6 in the last decade or so were paid to work on it?

[03:38] *** avs_ left
[03:39] <skids> There's a grant process that keeps records.  As far as I know, it is a very small number (but those that were were among the most productive, so a larger number by LOC or other metrics)

[03:39] <MadcapJake> FreezerburnV: btw did you see there are two SDL modules already http://modules.perl6.org/#q=sdl

[03:40] <FreezerburnV> MadcapJake: Yep! one of them uses the old SDL 1.2, which I have no real interest in due to SDL2. The other is a "raw" (and incomplete!) wrapper around SDL2. Meaning it is literally a giant set of definitions for native functions along with the structs necessary to use them

[03:41] <FreezerburnV> I'm adding missing functions to the raw one, along with a nicer wrapper around the raw native code

[03:41] <MadcapJake> FreezerburnV: ahh yeah, well the raw one could at least give you a headstart in wrapping the bindings

[03:42] <MadcapJake> Also this might be useful: https://github.com/Skarsnik/gptrixie

[03:42] <FreezerburnV> I need to go get my modified Raw module off my other computer, actually. My current code doesn't work due to only having the version on github

[03:43] <FreezerburnV> MadcapJake: Huh, that looks useful

[03:44] <FreezerburnV> Though right now I'm going the slightly masochistic route so that I can learn NativeCall better, as well as general syntax of perl better (there seems to be multiple ways to define enums, which I forget the differences)

[03:44] <FreezerburnV> (the current Raw bindings use at least two of them)

[03:45] <FreezerburnV> Also I find it weirdly satisfying to write FFI code

[03:46] *** erdic left
[03:47] *** noganex joined
[03:47] <MadcapJake> alrighty then! I've been wanting to write a wrapper for allegro someday, I might try using that gptrixie tool on that

[03:48] <FreezerburnV> Probably a good idea. Allegro is likely a lot bigger than SDL2

[03:48] <MadcapJake> Also I was a good chunk of the way through a set of FluidSynth bindings, but to me it gets boring trudging through tons of functions that I don't even know how (or want) to use.

[03:49] <FreezerburnV> Fair enough

[03:49] <FreezerburnV> I have an odd laziness where I would rather trudge through writing the code than setting up the thing that would autogenerate the code

[03:49] <FreezerburnV> Even if it would take several days less

[03:50] <MadcapJake> well i know what you mean, not saying it's a bad thing, but after a while, my mind just wanders :P

[04:17] <MadcapJake> interesting that the three layer tuple i posted, it only joins f and g but not c and d or i and j

[04:18] <skids> Each list at the top level gets .Str'd.  There are two such lists.  .Str, apparently, flattens lists.

[04:19] <MadcapJake> oh ok, so it isn't actually calling str on each tuple since the first two are being flattened via .Str

[10:01] <masak> moritz: how do I artificially raise my system load?

[10:02] <masak> moritz: note, it fails under `make t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t`, which shouldn't have that high a system load

[10:03] <moritz> masak: so that's what you can try next, plus maybe adding a --verbose

[10:03] <masak> moritz: running it with `perl6` a few times while the spectest suite was running: it ran to completion all the way to 60 four or five times

[10:03] <masak> moritz: then I ran it again, and then it got *stuck* after 54

[10:03] <masak> moritz: now it just sits there

[10:04] * masak ^C

[10:04] <masak> ran it six more times to completion, then it got stuck again.

[10:04] <masak> I think this is cause for quaranteening that test

[10:05] <masak> gfldex: ooh. neat.

[10:18] <masak> it's probably the biggest reason I sidegrade to `perl` oneliners these days

[10:18] <masak> but (a) I'm not at all sure exactly how the "safely overwrite the input file" magic works in Perl 5, and how to do that in Perl 6

[10:19] <masak> and (b) I'm not sure I completely understand how the passing of the argument to -i works, or if it has support in NQP's argument parser

[10:19] <masak> for example, `perl --help` says, "-i[extension]", but I don't think I've ever been able *not* to give it an extension

[10:19] * masak tries

[10:20] <moritz> masak: safely overriding input file is usually implemented by writing to a temp file first, and moving it to the new location later

[10:20] <masak> well, I'll be

[10:20] <masak> that was easy :)

[10:21] <masak> moritz: I think I'm going to try to hunt down the implementation of that in Perl 5

[10:21] <masak> (it's probably in toke.c) :P

[10:21] <masak> just so that we don't implement it *worse* and then have to hang our heads in shame over something obvious

[10:40] <AlexDaniel> a quick note: -i is not implemented in Perl 6 (unfortunately!), so you have to use ｢sponge｣ in order to do that…

[10:40] <DrForr> Morgen.

[10:40] <DrForr> o/'

[10:40] <AlexDaniel> or deal with tempfiles yourself if you don't want to rely on ｢sponge｣

[10:40] <brrt> good morning DrForr

[10:41] <AlexDaniel> and by not implemented in perl 6 I mean not implemented in rakudo… gah

[10:42] <AlexDaniel> honestly it is pretty hard to talk about those two independently until we actually have some other implementation that actually works…

[10:42] <masak> AlexDaniel: the discussion is about implementing it in Rakudo

[10:43] <AlexDaniel> anyway, the one who implements -i in rakudo will get big 🖒👍 from me

[10:43] <jnthn> "not yet in Perl 6" is prefectly fine though...means "not in the specification of any version of Perl 6" :)

[10:44] <masak> jnthn: but it is in S19, so... :)

[10:44] <masak> probably not spectested, though

[10:44] <AlexDaniel> anyway, just wanted to note that you can use ｢sponge｣ as workaround for now. Have to run now o/

[10:45] <jnthn> masak: That's design, not spec(test) :)

[10:46] <masak> AlexDaniel: that's good to know. thanks. :)

[10:46] <masak> maybe `sponge` is another bit of prior art to look at

[10:46] *** andrewalker joined
[10:48] <masak> yup. it is.

[10:49] <RabidGravy> yay!

[10:49] <masak> "It  also creates the output file atomically by renaming a temp file into place, and preserves the permissions of the output file if it already exists.  If the output file is a special file or symlink, the data will be written to it."

[10:49] <masak> from the man page

[10:49] <masak> I knew there were things I hadn't thought of! :)

[10:49] *** FROGGS joined
[10:49] <RabidGravy> masak++

[10:50] <masak> and there's a git repository

[10:52] <gfldex> .indent can't be replaced with ' ' x $indent ~ * because .indent actually checks how much indentation is already there. What I need for my usecase as I don't recurse around.

[10:52] <gfldex> my method indent(){ my $index = 0; $index += 2 while self.subst-eq('  ', $index); $indentor = '  ' x $index+2; }

[10:52] <gfldex> that works for me and is 20% faster in my benchmark

[10:53] <masak> far from a general solution though

[10:53] *** vendethiel left
[10:54] <gfldex> sadly

[10:54] <masak> I'm thinking whoever goes in and replaces those regexes in `method indent` to make it faster, might want to keep the regexes as comments

[11:59] <pmurias> Zoffix: is the Perl 6 version with Z and comb more readable to someone who knows neither Perl 6 or Python?

[12:06] <masak> pmurias: also, relatedly, how much should a language cater to the group of people who doesn't know how to read it?

[12:07] *** cc9989 joined
[12:07] <pmurias> masak: I suspect it's mostly similiarity to whatever else is popular 

[12:10] <Zoffix> pmurias, I don't think that has much relevance. At least from the point of view of my article, the programmer group in question is the one who regularly reads/writes in the language. But, analyzing the two, I can argue the Perl 6 is still more readable than Python version: for Perl 6 one will need to look up "wtf Z is" and the method .comb. The join ... is more or less self explanatory, but we can count it too: that's 3 things to look up. In python 

[12:10] <Zoffix> version, we need to look up what zip() does, in particular to strings, then we need to figure out how 'in' behaves, then we need to figure out what math operations on strings do (which can be guessed) and then there's still a question of what a join method on an empty string does.

[12:10] * Zoffix never found "readability for someone who doesn't know the language" a viable argument.

[12:11] <Zoffix> Is Chinese an easy language to understand for someone who doesn't speak Chinese?

[12:11] <Zoffix> looks like "linenoise" to me, but I'm sure people who speak related languges will disagree

[12:11] * Zoffix runs to catch the bus

[12:11] *** vendethiel left
[12:14] * brrt wonders if there are significant related languages to chinese

[12:15] <masak> brrt: Mandarin and Cantonese are related. both are "Chinese languages"

[12:16] <masak> brrt: Tibetan is probably the closest one outside of that group

[12:16] <timotimo> Zoffix: we don't have to "calling it on an empty trying"!

[12:16] <timotimo> (obviously using autocorrect or swype or something, eh?)

[12:17] <brrt> masak: of course... i was simplistically thinking chinese was one language

[12:17] <timotimo> also ... "viola! result." is hilarious :D

[12:17] *** nowan_ left
[12:17] *** nowan joined
[12:19] <masak> brrt: it's usually presented in that way (with Mandarin and Cantonese being "dialects") for some inscrutable reason

[12:19] <masak> the reason probably being "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy" :)

[12:19] *** vendethiel joined
[12:21] <timotimo> Zoffix: i really don't understand the problem stated in that stackoverflow post. it says "every nth element of final list is from list 2", but then the 3rd is x, the 6th is y and the 9th is ... g?!?

[12:22] <brrt> haha yeah...

[12:22] <masak> Zoffix: also, pro tip based on experience: try to avoid things on the intertubes (whether comments, or YouTube videos, or YouTube comments) that make your blood boil

[12:22] *** ZoffixMobile joined
[12:23] <ZoffixMobile> timotimo, yeah, because second list only has 2 elements, x and y

[12:23] <timotimo> i find the description of the problem very lacking.

[12:23] *** kid51 joined
[12:23] <pmurias> masak: I guess another commonly used readability metric would be "how readable it is to someone who sort of knows the language but doesn't care enough to learn it fully"

[12:24] * brrt can second masaks comment on blood-boiling intertube contents

[12:25] <masak> Don't Read the Comments™

[12:25] <timotimo> that's indeed always good advice

[12:25] <masak> pmurias: I'm wary of catering to people who don't care in various ways. I don't mind designing the language for people who can be bothered.

[12:25] *** RabidGravy joined
[12:25] <ZoffixMobile> pmurias, I often follow the "how many elements I have to parse" rule of thumb. a postfix for loop with two variables inside a method call is certainly eyebrow-raising to me than using a weird operator

[12:27] *** Actualeyes left
[12:28] <ZoffixMobile> masak, re blood boiling: https://xkcd.com/386/ :)

[12:29] <masak> absolutely.

[12:29] <masak> but the undertone even of that comic is that life is too short for that

[12:30] <timotimo> i don't think that comic is trying to advocate preventing people from being wrong on the internet by spending time on that particular problem

[12:31] <brrt> also, too many people will be wrong about too many things

[12:31] <masak> right, the comic is about the futility of trying to prevent people from being wrong on the Internet

[12:32] <brrt> in fact, i would probably find many things arguable about things $younger-self said

[14:33] <tadzik> timotimo: originally, yes. It was later ported to perl6 by [Coke], I think

[14:33] <timotimo> ah

[14:34] <brrt> if i must, i will elaborate :-)

[14:34] <tadzik> or colomon?

[14:34] <timotimo> were you running it on some server or something?

[14:34] <timotimo> since it's not running any more, apparently, why not run it on p6c infrastructure

[14:34] <tadzik> I was running the perl 5 version years ago

[14:34] <tadzik> I don't remember who was hosting the p6 version

[14:34] <brrt> apple will happily sell you a laptop which is almost, but not quite, a capable developers machine

[14:34] <[Coke]> tadzik: doesn't sound familiar.

[14:34] * colomon has nothing to do with synopsebot

[14:34] <timotimo> well, if you have no reason to use opengl ever ...

[14:35] <[Coke]> brrt: I have a work mactop that is pretty servicable...

[14:35] <brrt> because people confuse it for a capable developers machine, they expect development to just work

[14:35] <tadzik> huh

[14:35] *** nadim joined
[14:35] *** Fleurety left
[14:35] <brrt> however, the apple ecosystem itself is not hackable per se

[14:35] <[Coke]> brrt: "install xcode; install xcode command line tools". done.

[14:35] <brrt> yes

[14:35] <brrt> and apple gives you a set of tools which are almost, but not quite, workable

[14:35] <tadzik> silly people! Development is because things don't "just work" :)

[14:35] <[Coke]> with that and macports, I've yet to be annoyed.

[14:35] <[Coke]> brrt: what is driving this complaint?

[14:36] <brrt> too much stress in general :-)

[14:36] * tadzik hugs brrt

[14:36] <brrt> the RT ticket, in particular

[14:36] <nemo> xcode has caused me so much pain over the years

[14:36] <nemo> but it has gotten more usable lately

[14:37] <brrt> the simple and dumb fact that we're quite unable to get a VM, a text-based VM, that's all I ask, of 'darwin' and associated build tools to test our stuff on

[14:37] <timotimo> 2015-04-10 17:32:03     <--     synopsebot (~synopsebo@2001:780:101:ff00::2:9) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

[14:37] <timotimo> isn't that on our servers?

[14:38] <moritz> it is

[14:38] *** Fleurety joined
[14:38] <timotimo> yeah, that's the p6c.org ip space

[14:38] <[Coke]> the problem with jim's config is probably that it's PPC, and we're probably trying to compile JIT. that's my not-even-looking guess. :) His system is very old.

[14:38] <brrt> the process is this: people hack stuff on linux, bsd, and expect stuff to work on os x, because apple tells you 'os x is just bsd', and then it isn't, and then we have to find a developer with time and care who will test it on one of the many, many comically fragmented os x 'platforms'

[14:38] <brrt> this is a bad state of affairs

[14:38] <[Coke]> I think if we do as FROGGS suggested and give him some diagnostic output, he can probably fix it.

[14:39] <nemo> brrt: OSX + macports is "just BSD" ?

[14:39] <[Coke]> brrt: no one really expects that.

[14:39] <[Coke]> Certainly not jim.

[14:39] <brrt> i kind of expect that

[14:40] *** FROGGS left
[14:40] <timotimo> thanks

[14:41] <nemo> brrt: heh. I'm not a huge OSX user really. just out of necessity for iOS dev

[14:41] <[Coke]> brrt: kid51 is the PPC mac guy, btw.

[14:41] <tadzik> ah, PerlJam 

[14:41] <nemo> brrt: but, yeah, take freeciv's "OSX support" page http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Install-MacOSX

[14:41] <tadzik> seems I was almost correct geographically at least :P

[14:41] <nemo> you get to pick which of 3 complete unix-y package management env you get to install first before compiling on your own

[14:42] <timotimo> moritz: irc.p6c.org; is that the host that we give to people for having irc sessions?

[14:42] <timotimo> it seems strange that it doesn't ipv6

[14:43] <brrt> [Coke]: MoarVM assumes darwin == clang, and of course, we don't have the clang toolchain on aged os x instances

[14:43] <moritz> timotimo: it's the host I offered for that matter; but I've shut it down after a few weeks, because nobody used it.

[14:43] <nemo> that seems a silly assumption

[14:44] <Skarsnik> I say people wanting old plateform support, just write it x)

[14:44] <brrt> all this would not matter if apple was open about their toolchain and let hackers.. hack it, but no

[14:44] <timotimo> ah, ok. so no use looking if synopsebot was set up there

[14:44] <brrt> nemo: welcome to the MoarVM configuration system

[14:44] <moritz> timotimo: correct

[14:47] <timotimo> if i were to set up a new instance of synopsebot, would i create a new user for that?

[14:48] <moritz> timotimo: yes, new user

[14:48] <moritz> timotimo: and ideally write a systemd service file

[14:48] *** vendethiel left
[14:48] <timotimo> right

[14:48] <moritz> timotimo: see /etc/systemd/system/dalek-irc.service for example; it's no magic :-)

[14:48] <jnthn> The MoarVM configuration system will only change notably if somebody with experience of building such things for a bunch of less common platforms steps up to do it.

[14:48] *** Ven left
[14:49] <timotimo> i see that perlpilot has a bunch of commits in his repository that haven't been merged into tadzik/, but there's been two pullrequests merged since they both diverged

[14:49] <jnthn> In reality, if you handle Windows + most standard Linux + modern OSX, then you're already covering around 99% of potential users.

[14:50] <jnthn> Plus it handles a bunch of BSDs too.

[14:50] * brrt nods in agreement

[14:50] <jnthn> Anything else is a fraction of a percent, and it's just not cost effective to spend time on that when it could be spent on making, say, performance and stability better for the > 99%.

[14:51] <brrt> and adds that we're kind of limited by 3rd party libraries like libuv, which are very much platform-bound

[15:20] <moritz> the problem is that . and / have special meanings in paths

[15:22] *** gtodd joined
[15:22] <mspo> the static page generator can have a list of "broken" things to render in a different way

[15:23] <mspo> it's in the docs repo?

[15:24] <moritz> iirc STD.pm6 has a list of names for characters

[15:24] <[Coke]> you can build the site, but it's incredibly slow, fyi.

[15:24] <timotimo> if we translate . to period, what happens to an actual "method period"? :)

[15:24] *** prammer joined
[15:25] <timotimo> clearly we need a similar approach to "punycode" :P

[15:25] <moritz> timotimo: we can translate . to @dot and there are no @ in method names

[15:25] <mspo> why is it slow?

[15:25] <moritz> there's still potential conflicts with operators

[15:25] <mspo> or is that redundant? :)

[15:31] <sjn> ok, so URL-encoding those don't work (the browser just "fixes" the URL)

[15:31] <timotimo> aye, the url-encoding part is a layer too "high"

[15:32] <timotimo> or low, depending on your view point

[15:32] <mspo> sjn: it's probably still sending url-encoding but showing you //

[15:32] <sjn> if we use another encoding character than %, we just move the problem

[15:32] <mspo> chrome does that, anyway

[15:32] <timotimo> it'll probably reach the server without the server being able to tell a difference

[15:32] <mspo> you can't type XSS into the bar anymore; it's annoying

[15:32] <moritz> huh? does it encode < ?

[15:33] <mspo> I think firefox started doing the same thing recently

[15:33] <sjn> as long as it's internally correct, and all characters can be represented (including the escape character), it should work fine

[15:40] <perigrin> It had a 50% chance of both installing and not installing cleanly ... and only when you ran the installer did it collapse into a observable state.

[15:43] <masak> ok

[15:43] <hahainternet> and one thing he said stuck out at me, that when you have $obj.method, your methods are tied to that object explicitly

[15:44] <timotimo> Skarsnik: do it just like mplayer and friends to it with their config. interpret the config file contents as commandline flags

[15:44] <hahainternet> even though the method itself might be useful as a function elsewhere, without $obj or replacing $obj explicitly

[15:44] *** abraxxa left
[15:44] <hahainternet> but as far as i know in perl6, self is implicit and there's no way of having a bare function that's also a method? or maybe i'm dumb :D

[15:45] <timotimo> you can export methods that turn into subs "on the outside" of the class

[15:45] <Skarsnik> method are special sub I think

[15:58] <hahainternet> masak: indeed, i half expected someone in here to say "oh that's a weird requirement, i'm not sure"

[15:58] <hahainternet> but instead, instant perfect answer

[15:58] <hahainternet> that is coherent and kinda beautiful

[15:58] <hahainternet> damn you perl 6! :D

[15:58] *** andreoss left
[15:58] <masak> hahainternet: but I hasten to add that I wouldn't want to write many of my methods like that, since most of my methods (that aren't just syntactic sugar for other methods further down) would touch private state of the object

[15:58] <masak> and you can't do that if you're outside a class

[15:58] <hahainternet> masak: that's fine, this was a discussion about the downsides of methods vs plain functions

[15:59] *** ELBeavers joined
[15:59] <hahainternet> and my friend was saying how methods are just crappy functions that have mandatory arguments and become worthless without them

[15:59] <masak> hahainternet: basically, what we're (implicitly) making use of here is that if you dig deep enough into Perl 6, method calls are "actually" function calls

[15:59] <hahainternet> wheras here as usual, perl6 has the best of both worlds

[15:59] <masak> hahainternet: and the invocant `self` is "actually" passed as a hidden first argument

[15:59] <hahainternet> masak: yeah that's pretty normal elsewhere too, method(obj, args) ~~ obj.method(args)

[15:59] <RabidGravy> I love this two bugs for one deal I just got

[15:59] <Skarsnik> hm, why method have 2 arg at compile time btw?

[15:59] <hahainternet> but that's a smart model, because it allows complex behaviour like this, which is very nice

[15:59] <masak> hahainternet: in your friend's defense, I've seen a lot of OOD where your friend is right in all ways that matter

[16:00] <masak> hahainternet: but when you do OOD right, your friend is wrong, IMO

[16:00] <hahainternet> masak: he is a functional programmer, so i try to learn from his perspective

[16:00] <moritz> lv

[16:00] <moritz> sorry, wrong window

[16:00] <hahainternet> and his issue is more with languages which make assumptions in this regard i believe, so Python lol

[16:00] <masak> hahainternet: the one thing that FP people have over OOP people is that FP *is* grounded in something formal and well-specified. OOP isn't.

[16:01] <hahainternet> masak: indeed, but i was going through his particular hates and trying to understand them more

[16:01] <abaugher> I'm having trouble getting an exitcode from Proc.run.  The process does return an exitcode of 1 in the shell, and the error is returned on the :err pipe, but the .exitcode method always gives me zero.  Any ideas?  The code: https://nopaste.me/view/c40aed69

[16:01] *** _ramix_ left
[16:01] <hahainternet> i have found that any time i have any programming issue that is down to syntax or mechanisms or similar, perl6 has the best solution

[16:01] <masak> hahainternet: another thing that Perl 6 largely fixes is the objection "why is there always only *one* invocant?"

[16:01] <hahainternet> and what a shock, here too the best of both worlds remain

[16:01] <masak> CLOS fixes that one too

[16:01] <hahainternet> hell it took me no more than a few seconds to make sub whatever is Atomic {...} work

[16:02] <moritz> abaugher: the exit code is only available when the program has exited

[16:02] <masak> with multimethods, you can put all the arguments on exactly the same footing

[16:02] <moritz> abaugher: so you need to read everything from $err first

[16:02] <abaugher> moritz, ah, ok, thanks

[16:03] <abaugher> So the Proc is waiting for me to read that pipe because I said I wanted it.  I guess that makes sense.

[16:45] <masak> the best any Perl or Python programmer can do is to think about the similarities between the two languages, and between programs written in each

[17:58] *** Actualeyes left
[17:59] <ab6tract> since it is extremely cool that we get IO.watch for free in core, and likewise Proc::Async. so the first case of this example can be a ecosystem-free version

[19:32] <TimToady> hahainternet: the basic point to stress to your friend is that functions and methods really are unified within Perl 6, and that the primary distinction (apart from a bit of syntactic sugar for implicit self) is in the dispatchers

[19:33] <hahainternet> TimToady: i'm continually impressed with the thought that's gone into Perl 6. My only concerns are that optimization will be long and hard and difficult to do

[19:34] <[Coke]> hahainternet: actually, the architecture was designed to make them easier to implement.

[19:34] <moritz> it has taken decades for Javascript to become fast :-)

[19:34] <[Coke]> We'll find out in the next year or so if that holds up.

[19:34] <hahainternet> [Coke]: i have heard this said, but my knowledge is not exensive enough to know anything about it really

[19:35] <hahainternet> and moritz the difference is that javascript is unfortunately all but mandatory, not that i want to throw any doubts. I'll continue using 6 regardless

[19:41] <mspo> moritz: a definition of "success" would be a good start if you're going to say stuff like that ;)

[19:43] *** uruwi left
[19:43] <mspo> timotimo: I must be a little out of date, then

[19:43] *** uruwi joined
[19:43] <timotimo> potentially

[19:43] <masak> would it be possible to map out where those 90 MB go at the moment?

[19:43] <timotimo> seems like perl5 is at 4.5 megabytes of ram for hello world

[19:43] *** uruwi left
[19:43] <masak> maybe that could give a clue to what could be optimized away, if anything?

[19:44] *** uruwi joined
[19:44] <masak> or loaded lazily, or whatever

[19:44] <mspo> run hello world in a loop and gcore it?

[19:44] <moritz> masak: I'm only guess right now, but loading the setting is likely a big chunk of it

[19:44] <mspo> setting?

[19:44] *** uruwi left
[19:44] <skids> What size do the GC arenas start at?

[19:44] <moritz> also, most successful dynamic languages have a slower interpreter startup than perl5

[19:44] <timotimo> well, i've looked over the things it lazily deserializes when it does hello world and a big chunk of objects - though not necessarily a big chunk of ram - is arrays that belong to our NFA objects for our grammar

[19:44] *** uruwi joined
[19:45] <timotimo> skids: the nursery starts at 4 megabytes

[19:45] <moritz> mspo: the setting is all the built-in types and code

[19:45] <timotimo> er. the nursery is always at 4 megabytes

[19:45] <timotimo> it could be we keep around the other space always, since we'd otherwise just end up re-allocating it every few miliseconds anyway? i'm not sure.

[19:46] *** _Vi joined
[19:46] <timotimo> if somebody wants to lend us a hand for better ram usage at startup, there's branches that start implementing an op called "nfatostatelist", which would make these NFA arrays superfluous - they could then be created on-demand from the NFA objects themselves

[19:46] <timotimo> but lifetime handling of those objects is a tiny bit hairy

[19:46] <mspo> what was the command to manually compile?  moar --dump ?

[19:47] <timotimo> no, compiling stuff manually needs "perl6 --target=moar" or something

[19:47] *** musiKk joined
[19:47] <timotimo> =moar or =mbc or whatever

[19:47] * skids wonders if there is now such a thing as a page-table-backed lazy chunk alloc.

[19:49] <mspo> perl6 --target=moar -o hello.pl6.moarvm hello.pl6 didn't work

[19:51] <timotimo> yes, it will only work with modules. however, every script is also a module

[19:51] <[Coke]> jdv79: nope

[19:51] *** lnrdo joined
[19:51] <timotimo> so all you have to do is tell perl6 to load that script as if it was a module and supply a -e '' empty program to "use" the module with

[19:51] <jdv79> ugexe: sorry.  ill fix it tonight.

[19:51] <timotimo> RabidGravy: hey, have you seen synopsebot?

[19:52] <jdv79> [Coke]: why not?

[19:52] <RabidGravy> nah

[19:52] <timotimo> because the last thing synopsebot saw was a message from you about making a radio station application that can replace airtime

[19:52] <moritz> jdv79: because 2015.12 wasn't R*able, so we're waiting for 2016.01

[19:52] <timotimo> hm. after that, there's only one ping/pong. so something must have gone wrong anyways

[19:52] <jdv79> we should probably do something more reliable with the metacpan instance soon.

[19:53] <[Coke]> jdv79: lack of volunteers.

[19:53] <jdv79> ok.  well, we kinda want that for a study group that might meet on 2/6.

[19:54] <jdv79> i guess i could try to gen something if official isnt out by then.

[19:54] <[Coke]> there is a partial effort (nine++) at getting a safe release of 2016.01 that avoids any backward compatibility issues; once that is released, an R* based on that can be cut.

[19:55] <jdv79> ok

[19:55] <[Coke]> Anyone wants to help, test out his branch, make sure it's clean against the 6.c branch in roast, see if there are other commits that are safe to pull from nom...

[19:55] <[Coke]> TL;DR - teh first release post christmas is -hard-. please be patient.

[20:10] <Hotkeys> I'm getting this error when running perl 6 with linenoise on windows 7 http://pastebin.com/qK2F2Qcj

[20:10] <Hotkeys> any ideas what's wrong?

[20:11] <Hotkeys> or rather how I can fix it

[20:11] <awwaiid> oh right. I can't remember why I used the shell slurp setup instead of qx

[20:11] <jnthn> Yeah, the qx way is a lot shorter for the common case. Which is why it's there. :)

[20:11] <rindolf> awwaiid: thanks, so the document needs to be revised.

[20:11] <timotimo> so, i was wondering about module installation and multi-version-at-same-time stuff

[20:12] *** jast left
[20:12] <timotimo> do we need to have some way to allow module writers to just "use My::Other::Module" without having to specify the exact version, api, authority in the module code?

[20:12] <awwaiid> Hotkeys: I don't know much about windows, but what command are you executing there?

[20:12] <Hotkeys> 'perl6'

[20:12] <timotimo> like, if we load a module from a specific distribution, perhaps we could set a compile-time variable to hold info like "what's the current authority, version, ..." and also "what other modules are part of this same distribution"

[20:13] *** domidumont left
[20:13] <Hotkeys> which runs perl6.bat I believe

[20:13] <Hotkeys> or perl6-m.bat

[20:13] <awwaiid> Hotkeys: hmm interesting. Did you by chance explicitly install linenoise? ala 'panda install linenoise'

[20:13] <timotimo> so that a "use My::Other::Module" will resolve to the exact same version, authority, api, ... as the one that the use statement is in if that Other::Module is part of the same distribution?

[20:13] <Hotkeys> awwaiid: Yep

[20:13] <b2gills> jnthn: we can't have Seq.Numeric doing the same thing as Seq.elems because the [Bag|Mix|Set] spec tests require that it be cached :(

[20:13] <awwaiid> Hotkeys: cool. welp... you've reached the end of my knowledge here. quickly too. :(

[20:13] <Hotkeys> awwaiid: it was telling me that I should so I did

[20:14] <timotimo> because otherwise if you install versions 1 and 2 and you don't precompile version 1 before precompiling version 2, you could end up with version 1 use-ing modules from version 2 by accident

[20:14] <Hotkeys> that or Readline

[20:14] <Hotkeys> which i can't do on windows

[20:14] <Hotkeys> no libreadline

[20:14] <timotimo> unless the module author puts version info every-whooping-where in the source

[20:14] <timotimo> bread line!

[20:14] *** darutoko left
[20:15] <skids> timotimo: A distribution affinity like that would only work if the module author locksteps all the modules -- though I guess if they are unversioned and in the same distro that would be the case.

[20:15] <b2gills> rindolf: some think that qq:x// should be discouraged in favor of shell() and run()

[20:15] <Hotkeys> I'm gonna try doing a reinstall of all the things

[20:15] <jnthn> b2gills: Ah...that may be a sensible distinction then

[20:15] <Hotkeys> maybe that'll fix linenoise

[20:16] <jnthn> b2gills: I'd mis-read and not realized we didn't cache in the other case

[20:16] <timotimo> i think i was using wrong words here

[20:16] <timotimo> what i really mean is modules from the same git repository

[20:16] <timotimo> things that get installed together when you "panda install ASingleThing"

[20:17] <b2gills> jnthn: I think it is LTA though that +permutations(10) takes a long time, but permutations(10).elems returns instantly

[20:17] <hoelzro> Hotkeys: that looks like the error FROGGS and I found when trying linenoise on Windows

[20:17] <hoelzro> let me know if a re-install fixes it

[20:17] <skids> timotimo: if :version took an ordered list of preferences, then maybe a preference for same-distro could be pushed on the front of unversioned "use" statements.

[20:17] <Hotkeys> alright

[20:18] <Hotkeys> PermutationSeq?

[20:19] <b2gills> currently it is an anon Seq

[20:19] <Hotkeys> ah

[20:19] <timotimo> first of all i want to know if this is really a problem or if i'm just imagining things

[20:19] <timotimo> does this belong in a different perl6 sub-irc-channel?

[20:20] <rindolf> how do I specify a type for a paramter in rakudo perl6 / moar?

[20:20] <skids> timotimo: e.g. 'use "Foo"'; in a distro that was "v1.0" in the META would mean use "Foo" :ver(v1.0,*).  But then we might want to restrict that to only apply to modules supplied by that distro.

[20:20] <moritz> m: sub rindolf(Str $x) { say $x }; rindolf('foo') 

[20:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«foo␤»

[20:21] <rindolf> moritz: ah, thanks.

[20:21] * hahainternet just noticed the type graph on the Exception doc page, it's truly something to behold

[20:21] <timotimo> yes, only modules from that distro. otherwise things will get VERY strange

[20:22] <hahainternet> http://doc.perl6.org/images/type-graph-Exception.png is also a little unusable

[20:22] <jnthn> b2gills: Well, the point of Seq was not to have a proliferation of *Iter types in userspace :)

[20:22] <b2gills> Actually it might make sense for there to be a role that permutations/combinations/Range sequence that declares that you can call .count-only() on it without modifying it

[20:23] <jnthn> b2gills: Maybe. But I think we can live with it for now.

[20:23] <b2gills> It would of course add a requirement that you have to implement that method

[20:23] <timotimo> hahainternet: yeah, mostly due to the way roles are interconnected in there, i think

[20:23] <timotimo> hahainternet: if you can help us embed some interactive graphviz viewer or scrollable in-line image thing that doesn't suck, please go ahead

[20:24] <hahainternet> timotimo: if there exists an interactive graphviz viewer or something like that that doesn't suck i would love to know about it :(

[20:24] <skids> hahainternet: that's only going to get bigger over time, too.

[20:25] <hahainternet> i wish i had a good solution i'm afraid

[20:25] * skids wonders how a PCB layout utility would do with something like that

[20:25] *** sno left
[20:27] <moritz> skids: I'm only speculating, but most big layouts seem to have arrays of same or similar components lined up, so I guess there are some manual steps that allow you align them

[20:27] <timotimo> hahainternet: i've searched a few things, but nothing amazed me enough

[20:27] <moritz> also most modern layouts are dominated by a few pieces with monstrously many pins, which dictate most of the layout

[20:28] <hahainternet> moritz: few people use the autorouter to do everything

[20:28] <skids> moritz: oh for sure, but "monstrously many pins" does kinda describe some of those ovals. :-)

[20:28] <hahainternet> and honestly, autorouters aren't really what you'd want i don't think

[20:29] <hahainternet> well, on that note i'm also going to make my way off while freenode collapses a little more

[20:29] <moritz> timotimo: around 2007 or so I even installed an online map viewing software to allow people to browse my network of GPG signatures. It still sucked.

[20:29] *** buharin joined
[20:29] <buharin> hello

[20:29] <buharin> :)

[20:29] <vendethiel> hi

[20:29] <moritz> timotimo: though things might have improved since then :-)

[20:29] <timotimo> potentially

[20:29] <buharin> I wonder know why Perl6 get less users than Swift?

[20:29] <timotimo> nowadays, building usable user interfaces in javascript isn't as terrible of a task as it used to be

[20:30] <timotimo> buharin: because larry wall isn't steve jobs

[20:30] <Skarsnik> Switft is backed up by Apple x)

[20:30] <moritz> buharin: probably because swift had a pre-made niche to which all alternatives (objective C) more or less sucked

[20:30] <timotimo> also, you can use swift already to build apps for iOS, which makes you dollars "immediately"

[20:31] <skids> My experience with such problems is they keep making progress in academic papers but as they do so they use even more esoteric symbology to the point where people that wouls actually care to apply it are too busy putting their eyes back in their sockets to start coding. 

[20:31] <timotimo> perl6 doesn't yet have a way onto phones to develop apps with

[20:31] <buharin> with perl6 you will be always poor?

[20:31] <skids> (that was, WRT routing/mapping/data categorization)

[20:32] <moritz> buharin: there are already people making money with Perl 6; it's just not such a straight and mapped-out route as with iOS apps

[20:32] <skids> (and half the papers are just proofs that "indeed, this problem is NP hard and/or complete")

[20:33] <mst> also, the iOS ecosystem is a pretty terrible way to make a living at this point if you're directly selling things too

[20:33] <timotimo> no, no. you don't sell things on mobile platforms

[20:33] <mst> but, yeah, for the moment perl6 is more likely to be your secret weapon than a CV asset

[20:33] <masak> buharin: what you should be asking is about the various ways Swift is playing catch-up with Perl 6 (which is still ahead) :)

[20:34] <timotimo> you give your app away for free, show a big amount of advertisements and if you can get the users to accept your privileges on android also grab information about installed apps and such and relay that to other companies for money

[20:34] <moritz> or use the app for presenting teaser content, and then making the money from selling the actual content through in-app purchases

[20:35] <masak> buharin: but features are only interesting if you use them, and something tells me you haven't written your first Perl 6 program yet ;)

[20:35] <masak> m: say "hi, buharin!"

[20:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«hi, buharin!␤»

[20:35] <masak> now's your chance.

[20:35] <buharin> masak, I write Perl5 programs

[20:35] <buharin> even last time

[20:35] <buharin> but I used to swift 

[20:35] <masak> ok, so no Perl 6 yet. got it.

[20:36] <masak> I for one hope you try it! you'll be surprised.

[20:36] <buharin> masak, thats not problem :D because I like it

[20:36] *** gensym left
[20:36] <RabidGravy> it's going to be great

[20:36] <buharin> but got a long story :P

[20:36] <buharin> masak, if you want to know ;) maybe you can advice me smh

[20:38] <RabidGravy> well apart from a small amount of Perl 5, C and the language that Liquidsoap uses I wrote almost exclusively Perl 6 last year

[20:38] <masak> RabidGravy++

[20:38] <buharin> sure thats greate

[20:41] <buharin> I program C++ then C then Python now I am Yocto recipe scripture in my job ;P and my cousin said me go learn swift it will be greate you will be rich etc. so I think about future and buy iMac start learn swift, and as I can tell you doing interfaces for iOS in some visual designers is so boring to me always some strange problem I got and I start thinking about Linux and Perl etc. but where can I get job in it?

[20:41] <buharin> thats a problem

[20:41] <buharin> money are killing good open source ppl

[20:41] <masak> doesn't look that way from here

[20:42] <Ulti> m: say 'a'.split('').perl

[20:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«("", "a", "")␤»

[20:42] <moritz> buharin: if you find something you like doing, and are good at it, somebody will want to pay you for doing it for them. Then it's just a matter of finding them

[20:42] <Ulti> why would anyone want the start and end empty strings?

[20:43] <buharin> in 100%

[20:43] <moritz> buharin: if you like Perl programming, for example, go to a Perl conference, and be surprised by how many companies are hiring

[20:43] <masak> also, I find that money and open source have good ways nowadays to stay in symbiosis

[20:43] <RabidGravy> yeah, that's my way of looking at it, too

[20:43] <buharin> moritz, there are no Perl conference in my country

[20:43] *** gensym joined
[20:43] <moritz> buharin: where are you located?

[20:43] <buharin> Perl is very unpopular here

[20:43] <buharin> in Poland

[20:43] <moritz> buharin: there's a Polish Perl Workshop

[20:43] <buharin> w8 I will check

[20:43] <RabidGravy> nah, there are loads of people here from Poland

[20:44] <moritz> buharin: at least there are were in 2013 and 2014

[20:44] <masak> I've been to two Polish Perl Workshops. they were great

[20:44] <buharin> masak, thanks ;-)

[20:44] <moritz> buharin: also, there's YAPC::EU each year, which attracts folks from all over Europe

[20:44] <buharin> masak, because last time I write a perl script in my company

[20:45] <Hotkeys> Speaking of geography, any canadians here?

[20:45] <buharin> and I told it is multitool I write smh like tool for things which I repeat during dev many times

[20:45] <masak> buharin: you should try to find other Perl people (or other open-source people) in your local area

[20:45] <moritz> buharin: I was at YAPC::EU 2013 in Kiev, and it became a running gag that nearly every speaker concluded his or her talk with "and by the way, we're hiring"

[20:45] <buharin> and the guy said me ask someone here who like perl

[20:45] <masak> moritz: that gag spilt over a little to the subsequent YAPC::Europes too

[20:45] *** maslan left
[20:46] <buharin> and he said if no-one says yes then stop writing in perl because it will be unmaintainable

[20:46] <Hotkeys> are you saying I should move to europe if I want a perl 6 job

[20:46] <RabidGravy> this year I am going to persuade a company that they want to use Perl 6

[20:47] <buharin> RabidGravy, how to do it?

[20:47] <buharin> I talk with guy in my company and he says that perl is unreadable

[20:47] <buharin> no-one want to learn it

[20:47] <buharin> better write perl

[20:47] <buharin> shell is better then perl

[20:48] <Hotkeys> Perl 6 is less line noise than perl 5 I've heard

[20:48] <Hotkeys> although I never really used perl 5

[20:48] <alpha123> perl5 wasnt really linenoisey unless you made it that way

[20:48] <moritz> buharin: for every language out there, there are people bashing it. PHP? Ugly, unsafe. Perl? Read-only. JS? don't even get me started. Haskell? Academia only. And so on

[20:48] <buharin> moritz, I don't like PHP too

[20:49] <alpha123> yeah, the only language that's worthy of real bashing is PHP

[20:49] <buharin> but supporting only main companies languages is worse

[20:49] <buharin> you know for example D lang

[20:49] <moritz> buharin: the best thing you can do is write software that gets things done, and let the haters hate

[20:49] <buharin> no-one head about it till one guy start to promote it

[20:49] <alpha123> remember when D was relevant?

[20:49] <alpha123> yeah me neither

[20:50] *** ely-se joined
[20:50] <buharin> and what else sucks in os x

[20:50] <masak> at our company, we have been using Perl 6 for years

[20:50] <moritz> I don't like PHP either, but I acknowledge that some of most widely used blogging and general web platform is written in PHP

[20:50] <buharin> I use it first time but I can't run iOS dev on another platform

[20:50] <masak> it's one of our (no-so-secret) business advantages

[20:50] <moritz> I'd love to see something comparable in Perl 6 :-)

[20:50] *** kjs_ left
[20:51] <alpha123> also 90% of the web's security vulnerabilities normalized for language deployments are written in PHP!

[20:51] <buharin> and I got right now iMac and I cant install Linux here some strange problems

[20:51] <ely-se> PHP is my favourite dynamically typed programming language, because it doesn't allow for abominations like monkey patching.

[20:51] <buharin> why the fuck ppl like these systems

[20:51] <SmokeMachine___> shouldn't it be {1 => {2 => {3 => Bool::True}}} ?

[20:55] <buharin> only on Xcode only on iMac you can do a big money so I am poor at the moment quite I listen him ;s

[20:55] <buharin> and right now I think thats a shit 

[20:56] <Hotkeys> hmm

[20:56] <moritz> buharin: you can make money by providing value to others, and charging money for that. iOS isn't the only platform by far that allows that

[20:56] <Hotkeys> rakudobrew couldn't install the latest build for some reason

[20:56] <Hotkeys> just restarted lets see if that fixes

[20:56] <buharin> moritz, I event not earning 1k$ here in poland

[20:57] <buharin> cause the companies that come here pay us less than in US or UK etc.

[20:57] <buharin> so I think thats a problem

[20:57] <huf> yes. but they go there *because* they can pay less

[20:58] <buharin> not that I want to keep open source

[20:58] <masak> buharin: it's partly a matter of familiarity as well. I'm very familiar with the Linux toolset, from bash to vim/Emacs to LaTeX to Perl. this helps me solve problems quickly. other platforms approximate but do not quite reach that level of convenience

[20:59] <SmokeMachine___> moritz: should be {1 => {2 => {3 => Bool::True}}}, right?

[20:59] <moritz> SmokeMachine___: possibly; I'm not very confident in this area

[21:03] <buharin> RabidGravy, even in my work I do multiple things

[21:03] <SmokeMachine___> but using it don't throw a error either...

[21:03] <moritz> buharin: maybe you should stop focusing on tools so much, and learn more about the techniques?

[21:04] <SmokeMachine___> masak: I don't think that response was correct...

[21:04] <buharin> moritz, what do you mean?

[21:04] <moritz> buharin: algorithms, architecture, design patterns

[21:04] <buharin> moritz, I think about it last time

[21:04] <moritz> buharin: best practise, the fundamentals of your infrastructure, how the protocols work that you use (TCP, DNS, HTTP, ...)

[21:05] *** hankache joined
[21:05] <rindolf> thanks for your help , everyone.

[21:05] <RabidGravy> and develop a personal pattern book of architectural stereotypes that work will in real world applications

[21:06] <buharin> moritz, as about TCP DNS .. and so on what you mean?

[21:07] <moritz> buharin: if you develop for the web, all those protocols are used; it can help immensely if you know how they work

[21:07] <buharin> what about perl is it only for web?

[22:02] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: correct, but then it would be an infinite amount of empty strings…

[22:02] <Ulti> exactly

[22:02] <Ulti> thats why I dont like it

[22:02] <Ulti> '' is a special case

[22:03] <Ulti> its like the empty set

[22:03] <AlexDaniel> Ulti: you don't like that it doesn't hang? But honestly I also fail to see why would anybody want to use ‘’ as a delimiter

[22:03] *** raiph left
[22:04] <Ulti> also its a strange thing to "fix" from Perl 5 expectations of split

[22:04] <Ulti> AlexDaniel because split is infinitely more memorable and obvious a method than comb

[22:04] *** laz78 joined
[22:04] <b2gills> moritz: I figured out what the problem was with the permutations PR, and fixed it.

[22:05] <Ulti> frakly split with no arguments should imply the same as comb with no arguments :S

[22:05] <Ulti> at least thats what I expect even if its not what I get

[22:05] <[Coke]> Do you still have that expectation after reading the docs?

[22:06] <Ulti> split join is unaffected by split with extra empty strings but split with zip ends up being super unexpected

[22:08] <Ulti> thats different from P5

[22:12] <Ulti> well I've been using P6 for... 6 years and I just managed to actually use split wrong for the first time just because join swallows the '' just fine so you never notice and can cargo cult from P5 knowledge

[22:28] <pmqs_> Is it possible to match against a low-level type (int8, int32 etc)? Here is what I've tried

[22:28] <ZoffixWin_> zhmylove, 2.39s on my 1-core Linode box. Seems about right. There are a bit of points to clarify in your comparison against Perl 5: (a) Perl 5 had over a decade to optimize itself (especially with the recent drastic improvements in the .20+ versions), while Perl 6 is a brand new language whose stable version is not even a month old.. But more importantly, it's not *just* 1000 prints. You're getting the type system and all the built ins. Barebones 

[22:28] <ZoffixWin_> Perl 5 doesn't include that. Try importing Moose along with several List, String, and Math modules.

[22:37] <Skarsnik> pmqs_, there is something wrong here

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> e.g. we have [LTA] and [BUG] and stuff like that, I kinda expect to see bug reports about rakudo being too slow with a similar tag

[22:38] <b2gills> Rakudo-JVM is not up-to date

[22:38] <Skarsnik> m: my int8 $a; say $a.WHAT

[22:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«(Int)␤»

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> or should I just come up with something?

[22:38] <Skarsnik> m: my int8 $a; say $a.^name;

[22:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«Int␤»

[22:38] <Skarsnik> m: my int8 $a = 8; say $a.^name;

[22:38] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«Int␤»

[22:38] <AlexDaniel> [SLOW] ?

[22:39] <Skarsnik> That so wrong

[22:39] <pmqs_> Skarsnik, assume WHAT should give int8 ?

[22:39] <Skarsnik> yes

[22:39] <AlexDaniel> Skarsnik: I think that there was a bug report for that. Try searching for it :)

[22:39] <Skarsnik> m: my int18 $a = 8; say $a.^name;

[22:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«5===SORRY!5===␤Type 'int18' is not declared. Did you mean any of these?␤    int16␤    int8␤␤at /tmp/LvlnxVo0dS:1␤------> 3my int187⏏5 $a = 8; say $a.^name;␤Malformed my␤at /tmp/LvlnxVo0dS:1␤------> 3my7⏏5 int18 $a = 8; say …»

[22:39] <b2gills> pmqs_: there is no way that WHAT **can** give int8 (since there is no type object of type int8)

[22:40] <Skarsnik> m: my int16 $a = 8; say $a.^name;

[22:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«Int␤»

[22:40] <AlexDaniel> m: say int8

[22:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«(int8)␤»

[22:40] <ZoffixWin_> It's all in compilation too. 

[22:40] <ZoffixWin_> 17 seconds before it told me I got a syntax error

[22:40] <AlexDaniel> b2gills: okay but what's that? ↑

[22:40] <Skarsnik> m: my int16 $a = 8; say $a.REPR;

[22:40] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«P6opaque␤»

[22:40] <Skarsnik> this is wrong too

[22:40] <pmqs_> AlexDaniel, will take a look & see if there's a ticket

[22:41] <Skarsnik> m: my int16 $a = 8; say int16.REPR; say $a.REPR;

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«P6int␤P6opaque␤»

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> zhmylove: thanks for reporting this issue. I'll submit a ticket

[22:41] <Skarsnik> m: my int $a = 8; say int16.REPR; say $a.REPR;

[22:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«P6int␤P6opaque␤»

[22:41] <AlexDaniel> zhmylove: there is a high chance that by fixing this issue we will see general p6 speedup… hmm :)

[22:42] <Skarsnik> I hope it stopped giving me random bug when I work on gptrixie xD

[22:43] <ZoffixWin_> AlexDaniel, if you want to include this in the ticket: it takes 17s to run 10,000 prints on my box, but if I move them into a module and a sub and precompile the module, then I get 1.2s run. This is all compared to 0.2s run with Perl 5 on the same box

[22:43] <zhmylove> AlexDaniel: thank you very much!

[22:43] *** ratagin left
[22:44] <pmqs_> b2gills, what *should* be the way to get "uint8" if WHAT is the way?

[22:44] <zhmylove> ZoffixWin_: how do you precompile? Just make a first run?

[22:44] <ZoffixWin_> zhmylove, yeah. It's done automagically for modules.

[22:44] <Skarsnik> m: my int16 $a = 8; say $a.VAR.WHAT;

[22:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«(IntLexRef)␤»

[22:45] <RabidGravy> that's me done for the day

[22:45] <AlexDaniel> ZoffixWin_: thanks, great info

[22:45] <Skarsnik> m: class A { has int16 $.a is rw; }; say A.^attributes[0].type;

[22:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«(int16)␤»

[22:46] <pmqs_> Skarsnik, ohhh

[22:46] <pmqs_> that looks promising

[22:46] <Skarsnik> m: class A { has int16 $.a is rw; method foo() { say $.a.WHAT}}; A.new.foo;

[22:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar 775271: OUTPUT«(Int)␤»

[22:47] <Skarsnik> duh

[22:47] <Skarsnik> m: class A { has int16 $.a is rw; method foo() { say $!a.^name}}; A.new.foo;

[23:00] <pmqs_> Skarsnik, found the definition for uint8, etc in natives.pm
