[00:44] <bioduds> perl Configure.pl --backend=moar --gen-moar

[00:44] <bioduds> ===SORRY!=== No suitable MoarVM (moar executable) found using the --prefix (You can get a MoarVM built automatically with --gen-moar.)

[00:44] <bioduds> makes no sense to me

[00:52] *** cpage_ joined
[00:56] <timotimo> try an explicit --prefix argument to Configure.pl?

[00:57] <timotimo> or let it output what prefix each of the three pieces are actually working with?

[01:02] *** pierre_ joined
[01:07] <bioduds> cause it suggests me to --gen-moar and I do

[01:07] *** pierre_ left
[01:07] <timotimo> of course

[01:07] <bioduds> this is 2016.07

[01:07] <timotimo> --gen-moar is supposed to install a moar and an nqp in whatever --prefix you supplied

[01:07] <bioduds> doesn't happen on 2016.04

[01:08] <timotimo> if you don't supply a --prefix, it goes with basically "./install/"

[01:08] <timotimo> is there a install/bin/moar there?

[01:08] <stmuk> bioduds: no the third line from the bottom still has a .04 reference

[01:08] <bioduds> no

[01:09] <bioduds> oh, correct

[01:09] <bioduds> let me fix that

[01:09] <timotimo> maybe Configure.pl could list what it could have considered

[01:09] <timotimo> and give a better error message?

[01:09] <timotimo> though i think i've already seen an error message like that?

[01:10] <stmuk> maybe refactor the version into an env var so you only have to change it one place like rakudo-star-${VERSION}

[01:10] <timotimo> also, if you --gen-moar, that's not supposed to error out?

[01:10] <bioduds> you have a good eye man

[01:10] <bioduds> trying again

[01:11] <bioduds> im a little tired actually

[01:12] <bioduds> yes stmuk

[01:12] <bioduds> this is in my plan for final changes

[01:12] <bioduds> once all works on all linux distros im testing

[01:13] <bioduds> after I gather all suggestions from you top cats on P6 as well

[01:14] <bioduds> question, I do need to make and then make install?

[01:18] <timotimo> normally, yes

[01:18] <timotimo> but if you just "make install", it'll do the same thing as "make" before it can install

[07:04] <avuserow> I have an issue with unsigned native types within classes, where it treats unsigned integers as their signed counterparts. I can report this bug, but I was wondering if there's a bunch of native type work in the future or if it was potentially fixable without tons of changes.

[07:05] <avuserow> m: my uint8 $var = -1; say $var; class Foo {has uint8 $.bar is rw}; my $foo = Foo.new; $foo.bar = -1; say $foo.bar; # an example of this problem

[11:09] <tbrowder>  need advice: i'm converting a cpan p5 module to p6. it has many functions that return a variable number of array elements depending on the number of inputs.  something like "my @arr = foo(@input)" where @input can be one to N elements. what would be a better way in p6 to structure such a function?

[11:10] <titsuki> Hi #perl6. Is https://docs.perl6.org in the maintenance now ?

[11:12] <timotimo> it works for me at the moment

[11:12] <titsuki> hmm

[11:14] <titsuki> I can't access the official document page both Opera and Edge browser now...

[11:14] <timotimo> what kind of error do you get? can you try something like ping, traceroute, ...?

[11:15] <JimmyZ> tbrowder: sub foo(*@input) { } 

[11:16] <titsuki> timotimo: ping returns no responces. https://gist.github.com/titsuki/829ec20ccbeec01c0958d700247a5e6e

[11:18] <timotimo> OK, with traceroute we could perhaps find out where on the way the packets get dropped

[11:18] * JimmyZ can

[11:18] <timotimo> but i'm not sure how we'd continue from there

[11:18] <masak> greetings, #perl6

[11:19] <titsuki> traceroute https://gist.github.com/titsuki/9548facad88de1d63133baf2dbd7eee3

[11:19] <timotimo> wow, you're really not getting far at all

[11:19] <tbrowder> JimmyZ: thanks. i mean the io: would it be better to modify the input as read/write or no real difference in just returning a new array?

[11:19] <timotimo> is your access point or internet router or modem dropping some kinds of ICMP traffic ... ?!?

[11:19] <masak> japhb: yes, that's precisely the answer that modulo can't give ;)

[11:20] <timotimo> titsuki: or maybe you have some kind of firewall software that's a bit too "protective"?

[11:20] <timotimo> anyway, if you have a machine that you can ssh to, you can ssh -D 4321 and use localhost:4321 as a SOCKS proxy in your web browser

[11:21] <masak> tbrowder: if you're not sure which way is better, may I suggest trying it two or more ways, to see which one comes out nicer?

[11:21] <timotimo> it'll be a tiny bit slower, but it may get you through

[11:21] <timotimo> m: my $foo = "hello"; $foo .= &say

[11:21] <camelia> rakudo-moar 88ceab: OUTPUT«hello␤»

[11:21] <timotimo> ^- neat!

[11:21] <titsuki> timotime: I see. thanks !

[11:22] <timotimo> tbrowder: if your function returns an array, the user can use .= &yourfunc to replace the old array with the new, otherwise use $foo.&yourfunc to leave the original intact

[11:22] <timotimo> tbrowder: if you "is rw" and modify the existing one, there is no such choice

[11:22] *** leont left
[11:24] <timotimo> tbrowder: and, what's worse, you can't yourfunc(1, 2, 3, 4) or yourfunc((1, 2, 3, 4)) if it's "is rw", because then there's no way to get the values out, it'll probably even refuse to call because it's not an rw thing you're passing in

[11:24] <tbrowder> masak: yes, i should experiment with a small example

[11:24] <titsuki> timotimo: I did nothing, but I can view the official document page now...

[11:24] <timotimo> OK, so just a little network hiccup

[11:24] <timotimo> happens all the time

[12:54] <stmuk> ah that looks better

[12:56] <nine> stmuk: for the next life, I can only recommend implementing alls that Repository stuff yourself. It makes such tasks a lot easier :)

[12:57] <stmuk> maybe the gist examples (which are hard to find) might be better in a perl6/toolchain-misc-examples repo?

[12:58] <stmuk> or somewhere else with better visibility?

[12:59] <stmuk> inline pod6 in the rakudo source maybe

[12:59] <nine> feel free to put them wherever you think they will do good :)

[13:01] <lizmat> perhaps we should include it in core ?

[13:05] <poohman> hello,  a newbie to perl6 and perl here

[13:06] <nine> Hi poohman 

[13:06] <lizmat> poohman  o/

[13:06] <poohman> hello nine, lizmat - need some help regarding grammars and parse outputs

[13:09] <lizmat> poohman: although I'm a relative grammar noob, I'll try to give an answer   :-)

[13:11] <poohman> thanks, I created a grammar and parsed a file successfully using it - now when I try to output the parsed data using say it prints out the token name along with the text

[13:11] <poohman> is it possible to print only the text just like we do with normal variables

[13:11] <stmuk> maybe the curli docs should just go in the p6doc repo

[13:12] <timotimo> poohman: you can get the matched text by using .Str on the result

[13:12] <timotimo> the result of a match is a so called "Match Object", it keeps a lot of structure for you if you need it

[13:13] <poohman> thanks a lot - let me check it out and get back to you

[13:13] <timotimo> you can access it like a list and like a hash; if you have a token named "foobar" directly inside your match object, you can get the value through $my_result<foobar>; what exact things you have available can be figured out with $my_result.keys, and $my_result<foobar>.keys if foobar is a key inside $my_result will give you "the next step"

[13:13] <timotimo> i have to go AFK for a bit now

[13:13] <timotimo> good luck and have fun! :)

[13:13] <stmuk> or maybe uninstall-dist.pl should be a roast test?

[14:38] <yoleaux> 31 Aug 2016 20:00Z <bartolin> elohmrow: the UnwindException you get trying to install a module with rakudo-j is one of the bigger known bugs with the JVM backend: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124279

[14:38] <yoleaux> 31 Aug 2016 20:05Z <bartolin> elohmrow: there are a lot of skipped tests in roast due to this error. you can grep for UnwindException in roast to find tests with this failure mode

[14:39] <elohmrow> yoleaux: thanks for the info - it did not stop me in the end doing what i needed to do for my talk, but ...

[14:39] <TheLemonMan> El_Che, why is ruby needed ?

[14:40] <El_Che> TheLemonMan: the pkgs are created with fpm

[14:40] <El_Che> but that's in the container

[14:40] <El_Che> the pkgs have no dependencies

[14:40] <TheLemonMan> oh, I see

[14:40] <El_Che> moarvm and nqp are in the same pkg as the included 3rd party libs

[14:41] *** rba_ left
[14:41] <El_Che> idea is "run this command and create pkgs" without installing stuff on your pc

[14:41] <El_Che> everything is in the container

[14:41] <elohmrow> ++

[14:42] <El_Che> so as long you run a platform supported by docker you can create all the pkgs for whatever distro is included in my repo

[14:43] <El_Che> the contao

[14:43] <El_Che> the imgs are on the docker hub

[14:43] <El_Che> so no extra downloads

[14:43] <El_Che> just the docker cmd or beter, my wrapper script

[14:45] *** AlexDaniel joined
[14:45] <El_Che> in principle osx pkg creation is also supported, but I have no idea if the pkg fotmat is popular (I see img mostly)

[14:47] <El_Che> but rakudo already supplies mac and win binary pkgs so tht problem has been taken care off

[17:24] <Unavowed> Does perl6 have an equivalent of python's "with" keyword or RAII in C++ (nicer than remembering to use LEAVE)?

[17:26] <arnsholt> There's no built-in syntax, but it's pretty easy to write a normal function that does the job

[17:28] <Unavowed> Something like sub with($obj, &code) { &code($obj); $obj.destroy } with(open("file"), -> $f { $asdf = $f.read() }) ?

[17:29] <arnsholt> m: class Considerable { method cleanup { say "clean!" } }; sub considering(Considerable $obj, &block) { &block($obj); LEAVE { $obj.cleanup } }; considering Considerable.new, -> $c { say $c } # Like so, more or less

[17:29] <camelia> rakudo-moar 4d5abd: OUTPUT«Considerable.new␤clean!␤»

[17:30] <arnsholt> Yeah, that's pretty much it. Just remember to use LEAVE, so clean-up gets called on abnormal exits too

[18:09] <poohman__> hello all, Thanks Timotimo, Str. helped

[18:10] <poohman__> i have another question - there is a difference in the parsing if I use the Grammar: Debugger and when I dont use it

[18:10] <poohman__> is this normal

[18:36] <poohman__> and by the way is Timtoady, the Timtoady??

[18:37] <TimToady> so I've been told :)

[18:38] <poohman__> wow, screenshot at once - look who Im chatting with :)

[18:40] <poohman__> can I do something about it? the problem I mean

[18:40] <masak> no, you can't do anything about chatting with TimToady :P

[18:41] <TimToady> .oO(chat happens)

[18:42] <El_Che> TimToady is famous. He's the guy who invented the hooverboard it seems

[18:42] <TimToady> I vaguely recall there's an existing bug report on Grammar::Debugger bitrotting since last year

[18:51] <poohman__> read the bug report - was too deep for me - but will try changing my h* to s* and see if it helps

[21:15] <DrForr> Do multiple 'unit class Foo;' declarations cause multiple unit scopes in the same file? Or are they nested? I'm guessing the former.

[21:18] <DrForr> Just deciding how it should look in terms of Perl6::Tidy. Which by now is more Perl6::P6PI or something like that.

[21:23] <AlexDaniel> is there any reason to use a “try” block if you are providing your own CATCH?

[21:24] <moritz> no

[21:24] * AlexDaniel gets rid of one level of indentation

[21:25] <AlexDaniel> moritz: oh right, I should do that one day too…

[21:25] <moritz> clever of the letsencrypt folks to only allow certificates with 90 days validity; that creates extra incentives to automate it

[21:26] <moritz> and their current version of their client has a --nointeractive option

[21:26] <AlexDaniel> yes

[23:25] <timotimo> m: my @foo; @foo[3][1][0][5] = "hello there!"; say @foo.perl

[23:43] <lambd0x> by the way, is known if '^' for lower boundaries of ranges such as for $i^..^4 { ... } is buggy?
