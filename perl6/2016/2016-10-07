[00:00] <gfldex> no, because phasers are handlers for control exceptions and exceptions are local to a thread

[00:00] <gfldex> unless you produce a race condition yourself, your code is fine

[00:34] <gfldex> sadly they don't say how many glyphs they got in those fonts

[00:34] * grondilu meant to paste https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12654499

[00:35] <grondilu> hopefully, lots.  Otherwise there'd be no point bragging about it.

[00:40] <geekosaur> since my mint 17.2 has noto fonts already but it is an older one

[00:40] <gfldex> it's missing tons of glyphs

[00:43] <geekosaur> hm. "for all languages" aside from the emoji fonts I bet they let all the symbols / special characters / etc. go, possibly including things like presentation forms

[00:44] <gfldex> is there a upper limit for glyphs in a single TTF?

[00:57] <grondilu> yeah, FreeMono seems to show much more.  It does not look pretty though.

[00:58] <gfldex> don't forget to put a font into your modules! :->

[00:58] *** pdcawley left
[00:58] <grondilu> not sure what you mean.

[00:59] <gfldex> if you want ppl be able to read your code you better share the font you used

[00:59] <gfldex> the line I posted is basically my pick on chars that I would use as operators

[00:59] <gfldex> i'm very surprised Larry didn't insist on having ¬ ∧ ∨ ⊻

[01:00] <BenGoldberg> If unicode is in use, then the code should be euqally readable with any font which supplies those characters.

[01:00] <grondilu> I disagree.  Your attitude should be:  "here's my code, I'm using unicode with a decent font.  If you don't, that's your problem, not mine."

[01:02] <gfldex> not to hard to scan the source for any used character and display them in one go to catch surprises in a team

[01:02] <grondilu> I mean isn't the point of unicode precisely not to have to exchange particular fonts?

[01:03] <gfldex> technically, yes

[01:03] *** sufrostico joined
[01:03] <gfldex> but how do we convince font designers to play ball?

[01:04] <gfldex> you can combine fonts on windows, you just have to know where to dig in the registry

[01:04] <BenGoldberg> Or convince IDEs to let the user to set a list of fallback fonts.

[01:05] <BenGoldberg> Hexchat does that :)

[03:54] <AlexDaniel> … completely different

[03:56] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: maybe you should try something like https://github.com/sergot/datetime-parse

[03:56] <skids> Really, though, unless the range endpoints are complex, avoiding parens here is just making things difficult.

[03:57] <AlexDaniel> Herby_: but see http://modules.perl6.org/#q=date – there are many date related modules

[03:57] <Herby_> AlexDaniel: I'll take a look, thanks.  Didn't know if Perl 6 had a native way to handle it

[03:57] <AlexDaniel> skids: I don't see any difficulties in ｢10..100 .pick｣

[03:58] <AlexDaniel> except that it does not work

[03:58] <skids> It's precedence.

[03:58] <AlexDaniel> well, fine, I'll use ｢pick 10..100:｣

[03:59] <seatek> hehe

[03:59] <skids> Personally, I think (10..100).pick is pretty clear.

[04:00] <seatek> that's what i like to do anyway

[04:19] <seatek> Herby_, if it were me, I'd use DateTime::Parse to get a "real" DateTime out of those crazy CSV strings, and then just compare unixtimes if you need to compare them

[04:20] <seatek> Herby_, not sure how you need to compare them though

[04:20] <Herby_> I'll have two datetime stamps, and I'm trying to see if they are > 24 hours apart

[04:21] <seatek> then you can subtract them and see if they are 24-hours in seconds apart ;)

[04:21] <Herby_> i dont have a ton of experience with working with datetime stamps. it looks like there is a posix method, you saying use that?

[04:21] <Herby_> then subtract them from each other and convert to hours?

[04:22] <seatek> yeah posix is a unix timestamp which is seconds

[04:22] <skids> I guess it depends what you want to do on leap-second days...

[04:22] <Herby_> the data is for this year, starting in april up till now

[04:22] *** wamba joined
[04:23] <seatek> yeah if you want to get into the truly exacting stuff, there are HUGE modules to deal with that stuff. it gets very complicated if you want to be completely accurate across all things like leap stuff and timezones and daylight savings, etc

[04:23] <Herby_> for this learning exercise, i'm not too stressed about the fine details unless it can have a big impact on the > 24hours criteria

[04:24] <Herby_> the dates will typically be within at least a week of each other

[04:24] <seatek> but by converting everythign to unix timestamps, you get the number of seconds

[04:25] <seatek> m: my $dt = DateTime.new("2016-10-06T21:24:00"); say $dt.posix;

[04:25] <seatek> that's the date and time right now in seconds

[04:25] <seatek> you can do that with 2 dates -- just subtract those seconds

[04:26] <Herby_> gotcha. let me give it a shot

[04:26] <seatek> and you'll find out how many seconds are between those dates and times

[04:30] <Herby_> nice!

[04:30] <seatek> beautiful :)

[04:30] <Herby_> the big question is my csv dump has their timestamps in the format '9/23/16 3:00 PM'

[04:31] <seatek> DateTime::Parse should be able to handle that

[04:31] <perlawhirl> Yep, DateTime::Parse

[04:31] <perlawhirl> https://github.com/sergot/datetime-parse

[04:32] <Herby_> yep, looking at it now. the documentation is a little sparse...

[04:32] <seatek> It will take your crazy strings, and give you a "properly" formatted one that you can plug into the DateTime we were just using

[04:33] <perlawhirl> ahh! if i recall correctly it only accepts 3 or 4 "common" datetime string formats

[04:33] <perlawhirl> i had a module somewhere I was working on that accepted just about any string, but the grammer got a bit unweildy

[04:34] <perlawhirl> I also have an NativeCall based strptime and strftime implementation lying around somewhere which you could use in a pinch

[04:34] <perlawhirl> or you can build your own date parser if the format is consistent

[04:34] <seatek> https://github.com/Kodiologist/DateTime-Parse

[04:35] <Herby_> seatek: nice find!

[04:37] *** skids left
[04:37] <perlawhirl> that module is six years old... so potentially may have some issues with current rakudo

[04:37] <seatek> yeah that's what i was just thinking

[04:37] <perlawhirl> https://gist.github.com/0racle/09482c5f7bff6db9046bea259baf8237

[04:38] <perlawhirl> I had planned on making a module, but life is taking up all my time

[04:38] <Herby_> that does happen :)

[04:38] <seatek> that would be really nice to have up there

[04:38] <perlawhirl> Refer to the line 65-onward to see how to use it... 

[04:39] *** pdcawley joined
[04:39] <perlawhirl> Also, bear in mind it's not doing any error checking to make sure you've passed it valid token

[04:42] <Herby_> I'm on windows, I think there is an issue with nativecall

[04:42] <Herby_> or at least i thought i remember reading that somewhere

[04:42] <Herby_> cause i get this error running that script: Cannot locate symbol 'strptime' in native library ''

[04:43] <perlawhirl> oh... yeah, i'm not sure about windows... might have to just build your own parser sub... is your date format stable, ie. always in the "8/19/16 4:00 PM" format

[04:43] <Herby_> yep

[04:45] <Herby_> worst case scenario, i open the csv in excel and convert the column to iso 8601 before running the p6 script

[04:45] <Herby_> i've definitely made some headway tonight, so thank yall for the help

[11:36] <RabidGravy> I've switched Term::ReadKey to do so and It's working but the problem is PAUSE won't index it because it can't find a .pm file in the distribution file

[11:36] *** wamba left

[12:10] *** Praise- is now known as Praise

[12:14] <Xliff> What's the best way to test changes to NativeCall? Can I copy just the NativeCall dir to a separate lib/ directory and do "-Ilib" during invocation?

[12:14] <Xliff> Changes are currently limited to NativeCall/Types.pm6

[12:14] <timotimo> that can work, yeah

[12:14] <timotimo> just make sure it ends up loading the one you're changing

[12:14] <Xliff> The reason I am asking is because I don't see my changes taking effect.

[12:15] <Xliff> timotimo: How do I insure that?

[12:15] <timotimo> you could put a new "is export" sub in there and call it from your test code

[12:15] <timotimo> if it says the sub doesn't exist, it's not loading your changed version

[12:15] <Xliff> Hrm.

[12:16] <Xliff> Since I am changing STORE for CArray I suspect that might be the case.

[12:16] <Xliff> Since my test code does not seem to be finding the modified STORE method.

[12:17] <Xliff> If I have some time later, I may gist my whole problem and toss it out there.

[12:17] <Xliff> Coz this: 

[12:17] <Xliff>  perl6 --target=ast -Ilib -e 'use NativeCall; my CArray[int32] @a = ((^1000).roll(100)); say @a.elems; say @a.WHAT'

[12:18] <Xliff> Gives the following AST for the pertinent part:

[12:18] <Xliff>  - QAST::Stmts <sunk> use NativeCall; my CArray[int32] @a = ((^1000).rol...

[12:18] <Xliff>               - QAST::Stmt <sunk> use NativeCall

[12:18] <Xliff>                 - QAST::WVal(Nil) <> :statement_id<?>

[12:18] <Xliff>               - QAST::Stmt <sunk> my CArray[int32] @a = ((^1000).roll(100))

[12:18] <Xliff>                 - QAST::Op(callmethod STORE) <sunk nosink> :statement_id<?>

[12:18] <Xliff> But I get this error:

[12:18] <Xliff> Type check failed in assignment to @a; expected NativeCall::Types::CArray[int32] but got Int (582)

[12:18] <timotimo> oh

[12:18] <timotimo> no, that's just your definition being wrong

[12:19] <timotimo> you've declared an array of CArrays

[12:19] *** firefish5000 left
[12:19] <Xliff> LOL!

[12:20] <Xliff> So... how would I write that properly?

[12:20] <Xliff> 'use NativeCall; my @a = CArray[int32].new; @a.push: (^1000).roll(100); say @a.elems; say @a.WHAT'

[12:21] <timotimo> that's still just an array

[12:21] <timotimo> you need to := there

[12:23] <timotimo> .u �

[12:23] <yoleaux> U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER [So] (�)

[12:23] <timotimo> haha

[12:24] <Xliff> 'use NativeCall; my @a := CArray[int32]; @a.push: |(^1000).roll(100); dd @a'

[12:24] *** user9 left
[12:24] <Xliff> Oh! Beat me to it.

[12:25] *** wamba joined
[12:25] <Xliff> OK. So new error: 

[12:25] <Xliff> Cannot resolve caller STORE(NativeCall::Types::CArray[int32]: NativeCall::Types::CArray[int32]);

[12:26] <timotimo> the part before the : is the invocant (i.e. the type of self) and the one after that is the first positional arg

[12:26] <Xliff> Which is a start, and I'm still not seeing my code.

[12:26] <timotimo> right, ok

[12:26] <timotimo> a dirty hack would be to rename your own nativecall to something else :)

[12:26] <Xliff> HAH! Point.

[12:27] <Xliff> Thanks for that. Gives me something to sleep on.

[12:27] <timotimo> good luck! :)

[13:00] <RubioTerra> Hi, I need some help with grammars and actions: I have a grammar and it parses a file beautifully, but once I add an actions class it starts to give the error "Too many positionals passed; expected 1 argument but got 2". Even with an empty action class.

[13:01] <p3rln00b> RubioTerra: what's too vague. Do you have code to show?

[13:01] <DrForr> Put your code into a pastebn?

[13:01] <DrForr> *pastebin

[13:02] <RubioTerra> Well, my first question is: should an empty actions change the behavior of the parsing?

[13:02] <p3rln00b> No

[13:02] <RubioTerra> Yes: Grammar.parsefile($file, :actions(Actions.new));

[13:04] <RubioTerra> well, the code is quite lengthy, it's a C parser

[13:04] <p3rln00b> Right, wellk, that's not where the error is at

[13:04] <DrForr> RubioTerra: Still, we need to see what's going on.

[13:04] <p3rln00b> RubioTerra: we could be guessing for weeks here, without any code. The error is telling you you're giving one too many arguments.

[17:24] <bioduds> hi there, friends

[17:24] <RabidGravy> Rarrrr!

[17:25] <bioduds> looking for who suggested me to use Postgres to store data along with my NoSQL approach

[17:26] <timotimo> i was among the people who suggested such a thing

[17:26] <bioduds> geekosaur : was it you?

[17:26] <bioduds> timotimo : yes

[17:26] <geekosaur> several people suggested it

[17:26] <bioduds> I'm not a stubborn person

[17:27] <RabidGravy> use all the things, apart from RethinkDB which appears to have gone poooooof!

[17:27] <bioduds> I've been thinking maybe both worlds may be reached altogether

[17:27] <bioduds> I've been wondering about SQLite instead

[17:28] <RabidGravy> SQLite will work, but it doesn't scale out very well if you anticipate multiple users/threads

[17:28] <mspo> mm SQLite

[17:28] <bioduds> my architectural plans may be ok, I believe

[17:29] <bioduds> I would have not a single sqlite db file

[17:29] <bioduds> but several, each for each "document" so to speak

[17:29] <bioduds> controlled by a perl6 agent related

[17:30] <bioduds> I have something alike already working

[17:30] <bioduds> it will have a modern visual controller I am building with Meteor

[17:30] <timotimo> i don't know if that is very good

[17:30] <RabidGravy> they way you describe that I'm thinking that maybe some document based database may be a better fit

[17:31] <bioduds> I already managed to have it comunicating on the server side with Perl6 and Perl6 DBIsh working with SQLite

[17:31] <bioduds> RabidGravy : yes, that is what I'm trying to accomplish

[17:31] <timotimo> how much is in one such "document"?

[17:32] <bioduds> the "documents" will be SQLite files

[17:32] <bioduds> Perhaps each SQLite file will have only one table

[17:32] <bioduds> cause the DB itself will actually be the Perl6 layer on top of all I am currently building

[17:33] <bioduds> this way, INPUT and OUTPUTs would be in JSON format

[17:33] <bioduds> as I already managed to put up and works greatly

[17:33] <bioduds> does this sound reliable, timotimo?

[17:34] <bioduds> SQLite is ACID, fast and reliable, right?

[17:34] <mspo> bioduds: sounds sort of ActorDB-ish?

[17:34] <bioduds> therefore, data would be safe

[17:36] *** cdg left
[17:36] <lucasb_> how many "documents" or sqlite db files do you antecipate using?

[17:36] *** cdg joined
[17:37] *** wamba left
[17:37] <lucasb_> *anticipate, expects to use

[17:37] *** awwaiid left
[17:38] <bioduds> lucasb_ : my actual plan is to build a DB system. My first thoughts are to have one sqlite db file or "document" tripled along a network to ensure data wont be lost, each sqlite file corresponding to actually only one single table

[17:38] <timotimo> if they are all in one directory, you may have trouble opening and closing them quickly depending on how the underlying file system performs

[17:39] <bioduds> I plan to have them spread

[17:39] <bioduds> also having one perl6 file to control each

[17:39] <bioduds> instead of a main controller

[17:39] *** awwaiid joined
[17:39] <bioduds> that allowing for concurrency 

[17:40] <bioduds> that I will have to see later on development to check how it would perform

[17:41] <bioduds> this is actually main reason I want to split files into single-table files

[17:41] <bioduds> like DynamoDB, they would be like the Items

[17:42] <bioduds> sounds fair this approach, timotimo?

[17:43] <bioduds> I want to build something people can rely on from the ground, knowing it has a solid well thought architectural design on its basis

[17:44] <bioduds> instead of simply throwing in data into files in JSON format

[17:44] <timotimo> not sure it'd be good

[17:45] <bioduds> cause that would actually be wasting a lot of capability Perl6 has brought in that actually inspired this effort of mine in first place

[17:45] <timotimo> i'm not sure what you're hoping perl6 in particular will do for you here?

[17:47] <timotimo> and i'm also not sure why you think a bunch of sqlite files will be a good basis for your documents

[17:47] <timotimo> i'm not sure what your tables will look like, and what rows you'd have in those tables

[17:47] <bioduds> Perl6 is the main controller. Each table has a p6 file to perform all sorts of operations on data. Converting from JSON to SQL to store and reverting. Allowing declarative subsets to create schemas on the fly that are highly reliable and other features

[17:48] *** robertle left
[17:49] <bioduds> to summarize, benefit from all SQL has brought in so far in terms of good DB practice

[17:49] <timotimo> i don't think i know enough about the involved things to tell if this is good

[17:49] <bioduds> and merge it with the new NoSQL paradigm of IOing (so to speak) with the DB system

[17:50] <RabidGravy> yeah, but e.g. MongoDB or CouchDB will do all of what you just described without you having to write any code

[17:50] <bioduds> no prob, man, just trawling (lol) for some insight too. And opinions. :D

[17:51] <RabidGravy> plus scale out, shard, replicate and stuff across multiple instance

[17:51] <timotimo> like, i see no reason to have a single file per document

[17:51] <bioduds> RabidGravy : yes, but there is plenty of debate on whether they are safe while treating data

[17:51] <bioduds> yep, my goal is to have scale out, shard, and replication precisely the same as them

[17:51] <bioduds> but so to speak, fix the consistency problem many report as being a real issue

[17:52] <RabidGravy> so you are basically planning on making a NoSQL database system

[17:52] <RabidGravy> fair enough

[17:52] <bioduds> yes!

[17:52] <bioduds> but one that has SQL on the data-end

[17:53] <timotimo> that sounds like MulletDB the other way around

[17:53] <bioduds> benefiting therefore from all SQL has brought us so far and, at the same time, bringing in the NoSQL solutions that are quite remarkable

[17:54] <RabidGravy> I think Oracle does this ;-)

[17:55] <mspo> couch++

[17:55] <bioduds> for instance, SQLite won't have a (1..5)|"empty" field

[17:58] *** bioduds_ joined
[17:58] <bioduds_> but, building the way I am doing now, I declare a subset that will ensure schema for the data with Perl6 and can store it on the SQLiee

[17:59] *** bioduds left

[18:53] <harmil_wk> Can subroutines be inlined? Or is that a future optimization?

[18:54] <FROGGS> they can and are inlined if they are worth it

[18:54] <jnthn> Both MoarVM and the JVM can do multi-level inlining also

[18:55] <jnthn> (Can inline things that themselves have had things inlined)

[18:56] <jnthn> And yes, there's a "is this worth it" assessment.

[18:56] <harmil_wk> Nice, thanks

[19:39] *** canopus joined
[19:39] <p3rln00b> Can be simplified. But the trick is to not to `require` in mainline

[19:40] <harmil_wk> p3rln00b: that's much scarier when you put it that way... I'd kind have assumed that the random number generator would succeed or fail on large numbers, not just insert more zeroes!

[19:40] *** Matthew[m] joined
[19:40] <p3rln00b> :)

[19:42] <harmil_wk> Ah, I think I see what's going on. It's generating 32 bits of random number, shoving it into the first 64 bits and then, if the number is more than 64 bits, it repeats for the next block...

[19:42] <p3rln00b> ah

[19:43] *** shadowpaste joined
[19:43] <DrForr> Mersenne twister only has a certain number of bits, I think that's what it's still using.

[19:43] <harmil_wk> Might be more complicated than that, but I think that's kind of the basis. Note for larger numbers, it gets really odd.

[21:37] <DrForr> The way ORA is flogging it it must be popuar.

[21:37] <DrForr> *popular

[21:39] <jnthn> ORA are flogging kubernetes?

[21:39] * jnthn had no idea :)

[21:39] <jnthn> I like it so far, though

[21:39] <DrForr> Woops, was reading the wrong website :)

[21:42] <RabidGravy> what is kubernetes?

[21:43] <RabidGravy> sounds like some southern mediterannean menu option

[21:47] <geekosaur> it's an container management framework. (it's also the correct transliteration of what the ancient Greek would actually have been for "cybernetic", had they had the word)

[21:48] <RabidGravy> ah like docker on steroids 

[21:48] * geekosaur notes he forgot to change the an when rephrasing what he was saying, whoops

[21:49] <jnthn> Well, it uses Docker

[21:49] <jnthn> Deals with rolling container configurations out across clusters, configuring replication, etc.

[21:50] <jnthn> I guess it's to production what something like docker-compose is to development

[21:52] <perlawhirl> hi perlers

[21:52] <RabidGravy> boo

[21:52] <timotimo> yo

[21:53] <perlawhirl> Earlier this year I had the silly idea to write a datetime module for parsing and formatting, but unfortunately i really don't have the time to give it much love

[21:53] <perlawhirl> i've put it up here: https://github.com/0racle/p6-dately

[21:53] <RabidGravy> cool

[21:53] <perlawhirl> I haven't worked on it in over 6 months; it's low on comments and testts, and high on ugly code

[21:54] <perlawhirl> but it's got some good ideas... so hopefully someone wants to clone it and improve it

[21:54] <perlawhirl> or should i just put it on ecosystem under Acme. 

[21:54] <perlawhirl> since i haven't really thoroughly tested it

[21:55] *** benji joined
[21:55] *** benji is now known as xxdxdd

[21:55] *** seatek joined
[21:55] <perlawhirl> As far as I know... i don't think there are any other modules on ecosystem that do a pure perl version of strptime

[21:55] *** awwaiid left
[21:55] <xxdxdd> When running 'rakudobrew build moar' I get the response 'Insecure dependency in mkdir while running setuid at /home/benj/.rakudobrew/bin/rakudobrew line 21.'

[21:55] <RabidGravy> there's something that claims to I don't think it was complete last I looked

[21:56] <perlawhirl> ye... DateTime::Format, i belive. it's still NYI

[21:56] *** awwaiid joined
[21:56] <RabidGravy> xxdxdd, that's a Perl 5 taint error

[21:56] *** rudolfochrist left
[21:57] <RabidGravy> is your rakudobrew actually setuid?

[21:57] <RabidGravy> (and if so why?)

[21:57] <xxdxdd> I don't understand

[21:58] <RabidGravy> which part don't you understand

[21:58] <xxdxdd> everything lol

[21:59] <xxdxdd> what do you mean by the question "is your rakudobrew actually setuid?"

[22:00] <RabidGravy> er

[22:00] *** rudolfochrist joined
[22:02] <RabidGravy> the Perl 5 (which is what rakudobrew is written in,) knows that the script has been made "setuid" (that is the permissions indicate that the user should be changed on execution,) and performs some checks on inputs

[22:03] <RabidGravy> if you do "ls -l /home/benj/.rakudobrew/bin/rakudobrew" what does it say?

[22:05] <xxdxdd> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 28611 Oct 7 17:48 /home/benj/.rakudobrew/bin/rakudobrew

[22:06] <RabidGravy> weird

[22:06] <seatek> maybe it does that if it's being installed as user root

[22:06] <seatek> maybe it wants to be a normal user

[22:06] <xxdxdd> I changed permissions and it didn't fix i t

[22:06] <seatek> what are you logged in as?

[22:06] <seatek> who

[22:06] <seatek> whoami?

[22:06] <seatek> whoami

[22:07] <seatek> that file is owned by root

[22:07] <seatek> which could only happen if you ran it as root

[22:07] <seatek> at some point

[22:08] *** geekosaur left
[22:10] *** geekosaur joined
[22:10] *** wamba joined
[22:11] <RabidGravy> yeah but I'm pretty sure the taint check is only turned on explicitly if it's setuid, which that isn't

[22:11] *** sufrostico left
[22:12] <RabidGravy> of course the env or perl could be

[22:12] <RabidGravy> implicitly rather

[22:12] <seatek> i think he ran it as root

[22:12] <seatek> and it didn't like it

[22:13] <seatek> and was confused about what it was complaining about

[22:13] <seatek> but i'm guessing :)

[22:14] <xxdxdd> I'm logged in as benj

[22:14] <xxdxdd> and I changed the permissions

[22:14] <seatek> to what?

[22:15] <seatek> chmod or chown ?

[22:15] <xxdxdd> chmod

[22:15] <xxdxdd> u+x

[22:17] <seatek> can you do this?   cd;sudo chown -R benj.benj .rakudobrew         (that will change all the files to be owned by you and not root in .rakudobrew)

[22:17] <xxdxdd> still didn't fix

[22:17] <RabidGravy> what does "ls -l `which perl`"  say?  There must be something setuid there

[22:18] <seatek> good idea :) 

[22:19] <seatek> when you ran your rakudobrew build more -- did you "sudo" it, or did you run it as you, benj?

[22:19] <seatek> moar

[22:19] *** konobi_ is now known as konobi

[22:19] <xxdxdd> I ran it as benj

[22:19] <RabidGravy> the message is entirely correct if the taint checking was turned on by it being run setuid somehow

[22:19] <xxdxdd> when I do the ls -l

[22:19] <xxdxdd> root owns it

[22:20] <seatek> what are the rwx bits on it?

[22:20] <xxdxdd> -rwsr-xr-x 2 root root

[22:20] <seatek> aha!

[22:20] <RabidGravy> yes 

[22:20] <xxdxdd> how do I fix it lol

[22:20] <xxdxdd> do I just chown

[22:20] <seatek> how did that happen?

[22:20] <RabidGravy> chmod 0755

[22:20] <seatek> yeah u-s

[22:21] <lucasb> I would just rm -rf the rakudobrew dir and clone again, as the normal user this time

[22:21] <seatek> or 0755 is clearer ;)

[22:21] <lucasb> oops, no, the moar/nqp/rakudo clones may be there... and it's slow to clone everything again

[22:22] <xxdxdd> it still doesn't work ;-;

[22:22] <seatek> same error about suid?

[22:22] <xxdxdd> I recloned the repo without sudo this time

[22:22] <xxdxdd> yeah

[22:22] <xxdxdd> and I also chown 0755 /usr/bin/perl

[22:22] <seatek> yeah don't do sudo

[22:22] <xxdxdd> still no fix

[22:23] <lucasb> xxdxdd: do this: which perl

[22:23] <lucasb> and then ls -l `which perl`

[22:23] <xxdxdd> ./usr/bin/perl

[22:23] <RabidGravy> which part was "-rwsr-xr-x" the rakudobrew or the perl?

[22:24] <RabidGravy> this is all going pete tong

[22:24] <seatek> i'm wearing pinwheels

[22:24] <geekosaur> perl used to ship suid on some platforms, to allow it to emulate suid shell scripts (long, horrid story best forgotten)

[22:25] <seatek> sudo chown root /usr/bin/perl

[22:25] <seatek> i can remember that :)

[22:25] <xxdxdd> did that seatek

[22:26] <lucasb> reinstall your whole distribution :D

[22:28] <geekosaur> someone overwrote that perl

[22:28] <seatek> that could be too

[22:29] <seatek> aw, the fun days

[22:29] <geekosaur> the ubuntu perl is built with the perl shared object, so /usr/bin/perl is only around 18K

[22:29] <seatek> cd; ls -l .rakudobrew

[22:33] <seatek> mv .rakudobrew .rakudobrew-funny

[22:33] <xxdxdd> and can't use the two way clipboard thingy because virtualbox guest crap isnt installed

[22:33] <seatek> and then do the rakudobrew install again, only not run as root this time

[22:33] <xxdxdd> want me to just clone it again

[22:34] <seatek> yeah might want to move your .perl6 away too -- mv .perl6 .perl6-funny

[22:35] <seatek> then you can have a fresh start

[22:35] <seatek> but just don't do "sudo" on any of it 

[22:35] <xxdxdd> recloned it

[22:35] <xxdxdd> without any sudos

[22:35] <xxdxdd> still doesn't work

[22:35] <seatek> i still haven't found a way to do perl6 site-wide yet

[22:35] <seatek> how did you clone it?

[22:37] <seatek> did you do git clone https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew ~/.rakudobrew

[22:37] <xxdxdd> yep

[22:37] <xxdxdd> that's how I do it

[22:37] <seatek> echo 'export PATH=~/.rakudobrew/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashr

[22:37] <seatek> that too?

[22:37] <seatek> and then you sourced it?

[22:38] <seatek> sorry .bashrc

[22:38] <xxdxdd> yep

[22:38] <xxdxdd> I do that

[22:38] <seatek> go ahead and log out.. then log back in

[22:39] <seatek> then cat .bashrc

[22:39] <xxdxdd> at the very end of bashrc

[22:39] <seatek> set | grep PATH

[22:39] <xxdxdd> "export PATH=~/.rakudobrew/bin:$PATH"

[22:39] <seatek> do you see rakudobrew there?

[22:40] <xxdxdd> yep

[22:40] <xxdxdd> ./home/benj/.rakudobrew/bin

[22:40] <seatek> who owns it?

[22:40] <lucasb> tadzik owns it

[22:40] <xxdxdd> benj

[22:40] <seatek> does it have any "s"'s on the left?

[22:40] <seatek> what?

[22:40] <xxdxdd> me

[22:40] <xxdxdd> the user benj

[23:29] <ugexe> tbrowder: your source-url is a 404, it should be https://github.com/tbrowder/Net-IP-Lite-Perl6/archive/0.1.1.tar.gz

[23:30] <ugexe> note if you update the META file to reflect that url you need to bump the version, release, and add the new release url as well. or if you're feeling lazy just change the source-url and replace your previous ecosystem META.list entry url with this updated META6.json link
