[00:00] <timotimo> do it like me; stay around when smarter people talk and grab all the smarts for yourself using osmosis

[00:04] <sena_kun> timotimo, I did it since my childhood, to be honest, so jk. That's why I learned haskell, for example, and did other strange things in my life. And you know, it's not always a best way to spend a night(putting haskell aside, it was great).

[00:08] <timotimo> also, i believe the .list in my m: was superfluous

[00:08] <timotimo> as .sort will already call .list for you

[01:04] <lambd0x> timotimo: you know what...neither do I 

[01:04] <lambd0x> hahah

[01:04] <timotimo> and "my $tmp++" is the same as "my $tmp = 1", and i see no reason why you have $tmp at all

[01:06] <lambd0x> timotimo: ah, that was just because I initially was unsure about how to insert in a hash variable, afterward I did forget about it there...

[01:30] <b2gills> lambd0x: You can remove all of the conditional logic from your code. ( hint %h{'a'}++ will leave %h{'a'} == 1 the first time that 'a' is seen )

[01:30] <timotimo> collision?

[01:31] <timotimo> b2g is correct

[01:31] <timotimo> the magic behind that is quite impressive, though :)

[01:31] <timotimo> auto-vivification is black voodoo

[01:35] *** mcmillhj joined
[01:36] <lambd0x> b2gills: :)

[01:39] <lambd0x> timotimo: yes collision of values in the same key.. a large set of values for the same key that gets much bigger than the actual number of keys in the hash function.

[01:40] *** mcmillhj left
[01:42] <b2gills> lambd0x: If there is a collision the runtime hides it for you

[01:43] <lambd0x> b2gills: even if the input is huge?

[01:44] *** Ben_Goldberg joined
[01:45] <b2gills> It can store more than one key-value in the same bucket. There have been CVEs against Perl5 because it didn't split the buckets up in a few cases

[01:47] <lambd0x> b2gills: how that for a code? http://bpaste.net/show/006f17d9c1aa

[01:47] <b2gills> In fact I would expect that if you have more than ten or twenty key-values in a hash that it will almost always have some of them sharing buckets

[01:48] <lambd0x> b2gills: true.

[01:49] <b2gills> lambd0x:  the unless could have ｢%hash{$word}++｣ in it and it would still work. 

[01:50] <AlexDaniel> lambd0x: by the way, can you paste your snippets without “$ cat cal_001.pl6” thingy?

[01:50] <AlexDaniel> so that we can ask one of the bots to eval it

[12:09] <yoleaux> I saw Skarsnik 6 Jul 2016 13:58Z in #perl6: <Skarsnik> RabidGravy, do you have an example of using it async? I'd like to have a Discord module that use the websocket api x)

[12:09] <timotimo> :(

[12:10] <RabidGravy> boom

[12:17] <masak> how do I mark an exception as handled in a CATCH?

[12:17] <timotimo> you successfully smartmatch against it, for example

[12:19] <masak> what's the idiomatic way to say "if we get to this point, mark it as handled"

[12:19] <masak> ?

[12:19] *** pierre_ joined
[12:20] <timotimo> hm, i don't know of an idiomatic way yet

[12:20] <masak> m: class X::Custom is Exception { method message { "OH NOES" } }; { die X::Custom.new; CATCH { say "in catch" } }

[12:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77724b: OUTPUT«in catch␤OH NOES␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:20] <masak> m: class X::Custom is Exception { method message { "OH NOES" } }; { die X::Custom.new; CATCH { say "in catch"; $_ ~~ Any } }

[12:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77724b: OUTPUT«in catch␤OH NOES␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:20] <masak> "successfully smartmatch" doesn't seem to be enough

[12:20] <timotimo> hm. how does default { ... } do it, then?

[12:20] <masak> m: class X::Custom is Exception { method message { "OH NOES" } }; { die X::Custom.new; CATCH { say "in catch"; default {} } }

[12:20] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77724b: OUTPUT«in catch␤»

[12:20] <masak> gonna go with `default {}` for now

[12:22] <timotimo> oh

[12:22] <timotimo> m: class X::Custom is Exception { method message { "OH NOES" } }; { die X::Custom.new; CATCH { say "in catch"; succeed } }

[12:22] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77724b: OUTPUT«in catch␤succeed without when clause␤  in block  at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:22] <timotimo> m: class X::Custom is Exception { method message { "OH NOES" } }; { die X::Custom.new; CATCH { say "in catch"; proceed } }

[12:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar 77724b: OUTPUT«in catch␤proceed without when clause␤  in block  at <tmp> line 1␤  in block <unit> at <tmp> line 1␤␤»

[12:23] <timotimo> hmm.

[12:23] <masak> yeah; those only make sense inside a `when` clause, I guess

[12:23] <timotimo> the default { } does a succeed at the end, i expect that just skips over the rethrow we code-gen for the CATCH block

[12:24] <masak> aye

[12:46] <timotimo> neat, pypy got a flag for giving you a traceback for when the GC closes a file for you

[20:36] <pmurias> brrt: re finding unclosed filehandles, wouldn't recording the locations where they are opened be a resonable implementation?

[20:37] <brrt> pmurias: reasonable, yes

[20:37] <brrt> timotiom's suggestion was that pypy gave full tracebacks

[20:37] <brrt> which means you have to maintain and keep alive full stack traces every time you open a file

[20:37] <brrt> just for debugging

[20:38] <brrt> seems... expensive

[20:38] <timotimo> yeah, for pypy the flag is optional

[20:39] <timotimo> we can have this as a module that wraps the constructor of IO::File :P

[20:39] <timotimo> we don't need support in the core or backend or anything

[20:39] <timotimo> user code can do that

[20:40] <brrt> hmm

[20:40] <brrt> that

[20:40] <brrt> makes sense

[20:40] <brrt> actually, do we have destructors?

[20:40] <timotimo> yes, we do have submethod DESTROY

[20:40] <brrt> aha

[20:40] <timotimo> we have that in Failure already to warn when Failure objects get destroyed before they get handled

[20:41] <timotimo> which usually means a .sink is missing or something

[20:41] <brrt> but i suppose IO::File already has a DESTROY? can we augment that and still call the original implementation?

[20:42] <brrt> i recall not having destructors some eons ago

[20:42] <timotimo> we can probably wrap it

[20:42] <timotimo> yeah, we used to not have them

[20:46] <moritz> ok, weird idea

[20:46] <moritz> have a separate memory pool for objects of classes with DESTROY methods

[20:46] <moritz> then, before interpreter exit, iterate over them all, and call of their DESTROY methods (without doing a full GC run)

[20:48] *** yqt joined
[20:49] <brrt> hmmm

[20:50] <brrt> don't we already have a full-clean exit?

[20:50] <brrt> mode

[20:50] <brrt> also, why a separate pool? that means you have to know at memory allocation time

[20:51] <brrt> meaning you have a problem if a DESTROY role is ever mixed in

[20:51] <brrt> i'm not 100% sure that is true, though

[20:52] <gfldex> m: class B {...}; class A { trusts B; has $!foo }; class B { submethod BUILD { my $an_A = A.new(); $an_A!A::foo = 42 } }; dd B.new;

[20:56] <timotimo> i don't think trusts allows you to get at private attributes, only methods?

[20:57] <gfldex> running S12-attributes/trusts.t fails, so that may NYI

[20:59] <gfldex> m: class B {...}; class A { trusts B; has $!foo = 42; method !foo { return-rw $!foo }; method perl { "A.new(foo => $!foo)" } }; class B { has A $!a .= new; method change { dd $!a; my $an_A = $!a; $an_A!A::foo } }; dd B.new.change;

[21:02] <El_Che> I am looking into porting a perl5 module I use often (5 minutes here, 5 minutes there), and all the perl6 enhancements make it impossible toeven try a 1:1 port

[21:07] <timotimo> fair enough

[21:09] <El_Che> an other example, there is a method that accepts one parameter as the subject (dn) and the second as a values (str) or values (arrayref). Could be done with a multimethod, but varargs seems also a good alternative 

[21:13] <DrForr> You can override creation with a custom new() method if you need to, but ... Is the first 'values' a string with a comma or otherwise delimited list, vs. an aray of single items?

[23:00] <skids> What do we use to pass a NULL to a nativecall "int32 $foo is rw"?  "int32" does not work.

[23:01] <skids> "Native call expected argument that references a native integer, but got P6int"

[23:05] <geekosaur> Pointer[int32]?

[23:05] <sena_kun> skids, I haven't used nativecall for a while, but maybe "Pointer[Int32]"? Since NULL is just a pointer. It works in my code, at least. See https://github.com/Altai-man/perl6-Compress-Bzip2-Raw/blob/master/lib/Compress/Bzip2/Raw.pm6#L7

[23:06] <timotimo> can't have Int32, just int32

[23:06] <sena_kun> timotimo, ah, yes, it's a typo.

[23:07] <skids> I did already try Pointer[int32] but that gives same error message, just s/P6int/CPointer/

[23:07] <sena_kun> And "uint32" to be precise.

[23:08] *** RabidGravy left
[23:08] <sena_kun> skids, do you use it as a constant or what? Can you give a piece of the actual code, please?

[23:08] * skids tries to find a C stdlib with an int *

[23:09] <timotimo> it's no longer CPointer

[23:09] <timotimo> i think instead of Pointer.new(0) you should just pass the type object

[23:09] <skids> right I use "Pointer[int32]", rakudo error message is "but got CPointer"

[23:10] <sena_kun> skids, perl6 -v?

[23:10] <skids> This is Rakudo version 2016.07.1-74-g4be4609 built on MoarVM version 2016.07-6-gfd7fe64

[23:11] <timotimo> what's the "wanted" part before "but got CPointer"?

[23:11] <skids> "Native call expected argument that references a native integer, but got CPointer'

[23:11] <timotimo> oh

[23:11] <timotimo> in that case it may be enough to use "int32 $foo is rw" in your method declaration

[23:12] <sena_kun> skids, ah, okay. You can try to do what timotimo said then. He was too quick for me. (:

[23:13] <timotimo> and when you have that, you just pass a "my int $foo" directly

[23:13] <timotimo> i'm going to bed, i'm really tired

[23:13] <timotimo> have a good one!

[23:13] <skids> that's what I have:

[23:13] <skids> sub xcb_connect (str $display, int32 $screen is rw --> xcb_connection_t)

[23:13] <sena_kun> timotimo, good night!

[23:19] <sena_kun> skids, in a repl it seems good. Without return type. Something like `sub xcb_connect(Str $dpn, int32 $screen is rw) is native("xcb", v1) { * };`. Was your problem solved?

[23:21] <skids> no, the problem happens durin the call.

[23:22] <sena_kun> Ah, it was expected.

[23:22] <sena_kun> Can you provide a minimal example gist to reproduce?

[23:23] <skids> m: sub xcb_connect(Str $dpn, int32 $screen is rw) is native("xcb", v1) { * }; xcb_connect(Str, Pointer[int32);

[23:28] <sena_kun> In the examples here - https://xcb.freedesktop.org/tutorial/ they used null in both arguments, but C rules of types are loose.

[23:29] <geekosaur> I think this si a known shortcoming of NativeCall

[23:29] <skids> is it RTd?

[23:31] <sena_kun> Am I the only one who didn't get it? You can't pass a type instead of a value, can you? Or I misunderstood something.

[23:31] <skids> Passing the type is how you get a C NULL.

[23:32] <sena_kun> skids, ah.

[23:32] <geekosaur> I don't see it in RT. I'm sure I've seen this discussed before

[23:32] <sena_kun> It seems I need to refresh my own knowledge of how current nativecall works before helping someone. (:
