[17:44] <vendethiel> that seems pretty bad to me

[17:44] <tadzik> on the plus side, Nil usually doesn't happen in the wild

[17:44] <tadzik> so when you use it yourself, you should be aware of the risks :)

[17:45] <vendethiel> r: my @a; say @a[1].^name;

[17:47] <tadzik> *shrug*, fair enough :)

[17:48] <tadzik> que

[17:48] <tadzik> so it only works for .say, it seems

[17:48] <vendethiel> tadzik: array/hash access doesn't trigger the error. calling does

[17:48] <raydiak> r: say [Any, Nil, 0].perl # another of the aforementioned risks of Nil

[17:48] <tadzik> sure

[17:48] <tadzik> it's pretty natural that the access itself doesn :)

[17:48] <vendethiel> that kinda makes sense, though

[17:48] <tadzik> unless you're used to python

[17:48] <vendethiel> in the sense that Nil erases value

[17:49] <TimToady> not supposed to disappear there

[17:49] <TimToady> that's a fossil behavior

[17:50] * BenGoldberg fossil fuel behavior?

[17:50] <TimToady> making it behave like () in list context was a istake

[17:50] <TimToady> er, a mistak :)

[17:52] <tadzik> vendethiel: I recommend reading every material available, everywhere

[17:53] <tadzik> I had a lot of trouble understanding grammars, and I read everything that was there, and then wrote some code, and then after a while I started to grok it :)

[17:53] <vendethiel> tadzik: I'm pretty much up to 9

[17:53] <tadzik> but one of synopses is about regexes and grammars, s05 I think

[17:53] <tadzik> also, doc.perl6.org is very good

[17:54] <vendethiel> tadzik: really, I can understand most of it. I just need `make`, `ast`/`value` spec (to know where which are available) and %% in grammers

[17:58] <diakopter> lizmat added it after talking with jnthn today :)

[17:58] <diakopter> (shrug)

[17:59] <smls> TimToady: I think I found a problem with Brace_expansion#Perl_6 ...

[17:59] <TimToady> diakopter: apparently not "added", but replaced ".ast" with it

[18:00] *** Rotwang joined
[18:00] <TimToady> but the writing describing .made now make no sense at all :)

[18:01] <smls> TimToady: It expands this pattern: "{a,{\,b}c"  into these two strings: "ac", "{\,bc"

[18:01] <tadzik> :o

[18:01] <smls> which violates the "Neither of the braces is eligible to participate in delimiting a valid comma group" rule

[18:02] <smls> Perl and Python solutions both simply return the input in that example

[18:03] <TimToady> okay, I'll look at it when my brane is working again

[18:03] *** timo1 joined
[18:08] * smls thinks .made sounds like something that would return a boolean value. What was wrong with .ast?

[18:08] *** berekuk joined

[18:12] <smls> Well, "make" is the verb, and "AST" is the corresponding noun.

[18:12] <smls> "making an AST" sounds ok to me

[18:12] <smls> what more symmetry do you need?

[18:12] <timotimo> make → .ast seems fine to me, too

[18:15] <TimToady> I'm okay with turning .ast into .made, fwiw

[18:15] <TimToady> though if we're gonna do that, we should maybe bikeshed the verb itself

[18:15] <lizmat> I wouldn't be against that

[18:15] <TimToady> make having some amount of cognitive dissonance with, er, make

[18:16] <lizmat> the make / .ast pair didn't make any sense to me

[18:16] <lizmat> put / get ?

[18:16] *** SamuraiJack left
[18:16] <TimToady> yes, that was a bit fossily, but we can probably find some word that works both for the verb and the method

[18:17] <TimToady> I'm not sure we need two words

[18:17] <lizmat> stash?  :-)

[18:17] <timotimo> hm. attach / attachment?

[18:18] <TimToady> stash is also overloaded, and a character too long :)

[18:18] <lizmat> pot ?

[18:18] <smls> Wouln't the formal term in the context of grammars be "produce"?

[18:19] <timotimo> produce could be confused with reduce :3

[18:19] <TimToady> .oO(How good it is, to pot a yak!)

[18:20] <masak> I, for one, like "make".

[18:20] <timotimo> you would, wouldn't you, maksak? :)

[18:20] <masak> the actions make things. the things are annotations on the parse tree.

[18:45] <TimToady> smls: fixed, please break this one :)

[18:45] *** colomon joined
[18:45] <smls> I'll try :)

[18:45] <smls> vendethiel: Not sure if it's transferable to P6 grammars, but in P5 regexes imo the best way to parse quoted constructs is:  /" [^"]++ "/x

[18:46] <colomon> hey!  IRC is working again for me!  \o/

[18:46] <smls> Or if the string can contain its own delimeter escaped by a backslash:   /" (?: [^"\\]++ | \\. )++ "/x

[18:46] <TimToady> that is more or less what I'm doing

[18:47] <TimToady> so certainly it's tranferrable

[18:48] <diakopter> REIFY

[18:48] <smls> vendethiel: the idea is to match the opening delimiter, then possessively (i.e. disabling backtracking) match as many characters or escape sequences that are *not* the end delimiter as possible, and the match the end delimiter

[18:50] <smls> although I suppose in this simple case, possessive matching is not actually required (only as a performance optimization)

[18:50] *** Rotwang left
[18:51] *** Rotwang joined
[18:55] <TimToady> smls: in P6, "possessive" is usually spelled ":ratchet", and "token"

[18:56] *** woolfy joined
[18:56] <TimToady> smls: I note your possessive cannot match ""

[18:57] <smls> good catch

[18:57] <TimToady> would have to be *+, no?

[18:57] <smls> yes

[18:57] <TimToady> anyway, P6 grammars generally depend heavily on those semantics

[18:58] <TimToady> to the extent that we factor it out into the declarators

[18:58] *** araujo joined

[19:52] <moritz> [Coke]: not legally, but that shouldn't stop us

[19:52] <timotimo> vendethiel: yes

[19:52] <vendethiel> Okay, something I regularly ask from people when starting programming language. Would you happen to have one snippet (or maybe some) you would show somebody to blow their minds, possibly with the max. features you could put in there ? I'm currently using the PDF's version to get friends to learn it with me :D.

[19:52] <timotimo> vendethiel: search for "tetris" on the advent calendar for an example

[19:52] <[Coke]> I would expect that to be a showstopper. huh.

[19:52] <[Coke]> (to moritz)

[19:52] <[Coke]> happy if it ain't.

[19:53] <btyler> I think a fair few GSoC 'organizations' are just the group of developers around the project

[19:53] <[Coke]> ENOBEER

[19:53] <timotimo> vendethiel: blowing people's minds by putting as many features into a few lines of code seems like a bad idea :)

[19:53] <[Coke]> one thing that would need to be setup is a way to get paid from google.

[19:53] <[Coke]> (which being an org helps with a lot - I know there are orgs that proxy that kind of thing, though.)

[19:53] <moritz> [Coke]: I remember that the previous years, Software in the PUblic Interest (SPI) would handle the payments for those organizations that couldn't legally accept them

[19:53] <vendethiel> timotimo: for many people, that could be. But we're really just a group of friends learning a lot of languages along the way, so that's how we get other people's interest

[19:53] <btyler> seems like the more important aspect is how organized they are in identifying projects and providing mentors

[19:54] <[Coke]> util & dukeleto are good people to talk to from the parrot side, I'd wager. I cannot remember the original TPF person, but can probably dig it up.

[19:56] *** benabik joined
[19:56] <timotimo> on the one hand, you can implement a few different java interfaces using normal perl6 objects, like a regular sub could provide java's native Callable interface (whatever its name may be)

[19:56] <timotimo> and you can get a full compiler and thread context etc in java-land and feed it code, like the evalserver does

[19:57] <vendethiel> timotimo: real' nice

[19:58] <nwc10> moritz: agree. One thought I had (sanity check with jnthn etc) is profiling/tuning/whatever the GC in MoarVM.

[19:58] <nwc10> but I do not have time to be a mentor for anyone for any project, 5, 6 or $other.

[20:38] <moritz> colomon: April 22

[20:38] <colomon> I've proposed before that we should have an ecosystem cleanup-a-thon.

[20:39] <moritz> +1

[20:39] <colomon> as of today, there are 77 modules in the ecosystem which don't pass all tests

[20:39] <moritz> actually May 20 is the start date

[20:39] <colomon> all I was thinking was instead of a cleanup-a-thon, we could have a GSOC project with the same goal

[20:40] <moritz> we could, but it wouldn't be a fun project at all

[20:41] <colomon> okay, then that would be a good reason to have a cleanup-a-thon instead.

[20:41] <[Coke]> colomon: worse, there are things in the ecosystem that have NO tests.
