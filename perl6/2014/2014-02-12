[00:01] <grondilu> or maybe the same kind of output we get with 'cat -v'

[00:01] <lue> My issue is that Buf acts like a string with some array semantics, instead of a StrArray that I'd expect.

[00:02] <jnthn> S02 doesn't mention an ascii type. 'course, it's easy enough to add, I think :)

[00:02] <lue> e.g. Buf[0..3].Buf fails, but Buf.subbuf(0,3).Buf works. But I don't want to think of/use Buf as a funny string, I want to use it as a binary array.

[00:36] <clsn> So what's to be the deal with openers and closers from Unicode tables?  It seems we can get opens/closes from BidiBrackets.txt for mirrored brackets; (﴾ ﴿ are a special case, according to the file, so we can just include them); but what about all the various Pi/Pf pairs?  You can and do have multiple openers for the same closer.  Are those to be all just special-cased?

[00:36] <clsn> I mean, I guess we can guess with Pi/Pf by what's before what in Unicode, and then have a list of exceptions to fine-tune that.

[00:38] <clsn> Actually, I count maybe 11 pairs of Pi/Pf, so maybe it isn't such a big deal.

[00:38] <clsn> Just that they're important: «», ‹›, “”, etc.

[00:51] <clsn> Yeah, I just noticed that... So not pulling from files, but use the props directly.

[00:51] <clsn> Much better.

[00:52] <TimToady> well, you don't want to slow down startup, to the extent you can pre-analyze

[00:52] *** raiph left
[00:53] <TimToady> it can be recalculated whenever we know the props changed, and cached in an easy-to-load format

[00:53] <clsn> Yeah... Do the work up-front if at all possible.

[00:53] <TimToady> 2nd best is do it lazily like P5 does

[00:54] <TimToady> well, depends on how much you value startup time in the absence of Unicode-isms

[00:55] <lue> I think pre-generated list is the fastest option.

[00:55] <clsn> Ideally up-front in the sense of "at time of compiling perl6 in the first place"

[00:55] <clsn> Currently std has them as a big hash and a big string-list.  No reason we can't generate the same string at compile-time, is there?

[00:56] <TimToady> well, modulo bootstrapping issues

[00:56] <lue> as long as the underlying VM provides a way to poke its unicode tables for specific character categories, maybe.

[00:57] <clsn> Yeah, depending on how much power we have by the time we're doing it.  And if we can't poke categories, we're back to square one.

[01:11] <segomos> how would that look?

[01:15] <segomos> observational astronomy

[01:18] * TimToady wonders what non-observational astronomy would consist of...

[01:18] <geekosaur> simulations, mostly

[01:19] <grondilu> theory, as well

[01:19] <grondilu> (though that's probably cosmology)

[01:19] <TimToady> and the simulations are just physics :)

[01:19] <grondilu> everything but maths is physics :)

[01:19] <geekosaur> there is theory involved to the extent that they're still trying to understand key parts of how stars, galaxies, black holes, etc. are formed

[01:20] <geekosaur> and it's kinda hard to watch live

[01:21] <segomos> i'm watching the nye and ham debate on youtube

[01:22] <grondilu> quite dpressing, isn't it?

[01:22] <segomos> i find it pretty funny

[01:22] <TimToady> it's even more depressing for us theists :/

[01:23] <segomos> i think ham just isolates creationists, not really all theists

[01:24] <lue> I genuinely curious as to why people like that can't just say "I guess God made everything via evolution."

[01:24] <lue> s/I/I'm/

[01:25] <grondilu> because that's not what is Written, so that would make them feel uncomfortable, I guess.

[01:25] <TimToady> there are just way too many Christians who are way too willing to tell God how he must've meant Genesis 1

[01:25] <segomos> lue: i'm also curious why they don't just cling to that too

[01:25] * TimToady is happy with however God did it.  :)

[01:25] <colomon> +1

[01:25] <lue> IIRC Genesis only says "made animals/grass/etc.", it doesn't say "made with a magic wand" or anything specific.

[01:26] <segomos> +1

[01:26] <lue> +1 as well :)

[01:26] <colomon> lue: I think we can all agree that evolving them from single-cell creatures in one 24-hour period is probably a bit much.  ;)

[01:26] <grondilu> well, it does says a few things about clay or something

[01:27] <grondilu> that's just ass weird as a magic wand

[01:27] <grondilu> *as

[01:27] * lue has not actually read the Bible </disclaimer>

[01:27] <TimToady> clay is, oddly, right in the mix of biogenesis theories :)

[01:27] *** thou left
[01:28] <lue> colomon: you know who could make evolution happen in 24 hours? God. :P

[01:28] <TimToady> what you mean is, if anyone is allowed to cheat, it's God

[01:28] <colomon> TimToady surely knows more about this than I do, but my impression is that if you take Genesis 1 literally you immediately run into continuity issues with Genesis 2.

[01:28] <TimToady> but I think it's a bit out of character :)

[01:29] <jercos> lue: "And God said, Let the earth bring forth [...]" so doesn't even really say he did anything, just that he said it should happen

[01:29] <TimToady> well, the structure of Gen 1 is obviously a poem, or perhaps a worship chant

[01:29] <jercos> Emperor Norton ordered the bay bridge built, but he didn't build it :|

[01:29] <segomos> jercos: it's a translation

[01:29] <TimToady> it's obviously not a scientific text

[01:30] <lue> TimToady: for some definition of his character, at least :P (that whole "how can evil exist" thing IIRC)

[01:30] * TimToady is particularly sensitive to young-earth creationists, because he used to be one

[01:30] <TimToady> then he started actually looking at the evidence

[01:30] <TimToady> (was raised in that culture)

[01:31] <TimToady> well, even most atheists look at creation and would rather that it exist than not exist

[01:31] <TimToady> some in some sense they believe "It was all very good."

[01:31] <segomos> i went to catholic school

[01:32] <TimToady> we all have to start thinking for ourselves at some point, or let someone else tell us what to think

[01:32] <lue> TimToady: "The creation of the universe made a lot of people very angry and was widely regarded as a bad move."

[01:32] <colomon> Adams++

[01:32] <geekosaur> colomon: I can't really speak to various Christian interpretations but the typical Jewish one is that Gen 1 describes man-as-animal and Gen 2 describes the fashioning of his soul

[01:32] <segomos> lue: lmao

[01:32] <geekosaur> but the Jewish view on souls is ... complex

[01:32] <TimToady> as it should be

[01:33] <segomos> i liked judaism

[01:33] * rjbs speaks no ill of the people who brought us klezmer.

[01:35] <TimToady> well, pretty much everyone mixes up their culture with their religion at some point, and we tend to be blind to our own layers of cultural interpreation

[01:35] <lue> Huh, I didn't know these were things God supposedly couldn't do: lie, be tempted by evil, or quit :)

[01:35] <TimToady> *interpretation

[01:36] <TimToady> no, but apparently he's allowed to send a lying spirit to someone :)

[01:39] <geekosaur> (that can't-understand is more or less how I reconcile Torah with the real world; it speaks directly to the comprehension of its time with hints at the reality embedded within, some of which we time-bound mortals will never understand)

[08:15] <lizmat> good *, #perl6 from the other side of our little pond

[08:15] <FROGGS> hi lizmat 

[08:15] <yoleaux> 11 Feb 2014 23:10Z <pippo> FROGGS: after some testing with gdb. It appears that replacing 'handle->body.encoding_type' with 'body->encoding_type' on line 652 solves the problem.

[08:15] <yoleaux> 11 Feb 2014 23:10Z <pippo> FROGGS: It appears that on line 649,  uv_run(tc->loop, UV_RUN_DEFAULT), is resetting 'handle' to 0x0. But 'body' maintains the address of the data structure.

[08:16] <lizmat> FROGGS o/

[08:17] <FROGGS> .tell pippo Yeah, I was fearing that running the loop would cause this... So we possible would just need to root it, but my gut feeling says that this issue is part of a bigger problem

[08:17] <yoleaux> FROGGS: I'll pass your message to pippo.

[08:28] * raydiak just noticed that run doesn't seem to ever work for him, but shell does

[08:31] <raydiak> has anyone else had that problem?

[08:32] <FROGGS> no, it works very well for me

[08:33] <raydiak> I've tried it on jvm on two machines and moar on one of the same machines

[08:34] <raydiak> r: say run "echo" # if this isn't somehow disabled for security

[08:34] <raydiak> I wonder what I'm doing to cause that

[08:35] <raydiak> (by "that" I mean my original problem, of course, not the restricted setting)

[08:35] <FROGGS> I dunno

[08:35] <FROGGS> and have sadly no time atm (being in a call for a few hours)

[08:36] <raydiak> it causes the docs to silently fail to generate images when I htmlify, which caused the images to all get broken on doc.perl6.org when I synced yesterday, which they still are

[08:37] <raydiak> didn't notice until an hour or two ago, and have been trying to track down the precise problem since

[08:38] * raydiak will just change that line to use "shell" for now, and re-run it

[09:18] <timotimo> oh, haha

[09:18] <moritz> timotimo: each combination of day+IP+referrer is counted as one visitor, afaict

[09:20] <moritz> and (www.)perl6.org has about 24k visitors per month

[09:21] <timotimo> crawlers filtered out already?

[09:21] <moritz> http://perl6.org/page-stats/ has all the details

[09:21] <moritz> timotimo: yes (those that play by the rules, at least)

[09:22] <raydiak> moritz: is there any "maximum width" for the generated images? I noticed the typegraph image for Cool is wider than the width of the body set in the css

[09:22] <raydiak> which you don't notice until you go trying to wrap them in something visible, like on http://p6doc.cyberuniverses.com/type/Cool

[09:22] <timotimo> wow, there is a noticable difference between weekend and weekday visitors

[09:22] <moritz> raydiak: I don't think so; iirc japhb_++ created those images, maybe he has a good idea for how to fix it

[09:23] <timotimo> %)

[09:24] <moritz> raydiak: fwiw I'm not sold on the white-and-blue layout; if you have better ideas, feel free to change it

[09:24] <moritz> though I do prefer black text on white background for the main copy

[09:26] <raydiak> moritz: the images are graphviz-generated, so I can always adjust it on way or another, or adjust the width of the template (since I'll end up replacing it entirely anyway)

[09:26] <raydiak> *one way or another

[09:27] <raydiak> I was just trying to make my copy a little less heinous while I figure out what to *actually* do with the template

[09:28] * moritz loves how he can create some content, and folks from the community make awesome layouts for it

[09:28] <moritz> has happened to the IRC logs, perl6.org, the feature matrix

[09:29] <raydiak> polish all the shinies!

[09:30] <raydiak> have been trying to figure out what I can do to be more directly useful, doc.perl6.org looks like a good place to start

[09:30] <moritz> aye

[09:31] <raydiak> are we going to want other content on that site besides what is directly generated from the Pods? and if so, do we want that "other stuff" to be handled within the htmlify script?

[09:32] <moritz> raydiak: what "other stuff" are you thinking about?

[09:34] <raydiak> moritz: I am not sure if I have a specific, concrete idea atm, am just trying to determine the scope of the project

[09:34] <moritz> raydiak: atm I don't have plans for other files

[09:35] <moritz> but it's not really a question I've thought much about

[09:35] <raydiak> we could have the synopses mirrored there, for one...of course those are pod too I assume, so that's not a very good example

[09:37] <raydiak> I guess I'd just like to see more of the various official resources tied together so you don't have to jump around from site to site so much when you're looking things up in various ways

[09:37] <raydiak> but maybe that'd be better handled by just making the docs better instead of tying a bunch of other stuff into the website

[09:37] <moritz> aye

[09:38] <moritz> the synopses aren't meant for users

[09:38] <moritz> and we only link to them that often because we don't have anything better for users

[09:39] <raydiak> good to know, that definitely makes some difference to the optimal look and feel

[09:40] *** denis_boyun left
[09:40] <moritz> for example at http://doc.perl6.org/type/List#combinations I try to give examples (and sometimes use cases), much more than the specs (which often deals with edge cases)

[10:23] <pmurias> moritz: re synopses aren't meant for users, will there be a user oriented spec?

[10:23] *** mavcunha left
[10:23] <moritz> pmurias: doc.perl6.org aims to be that

[10:23] <tadzik> should a spec be user oriented? :) doc.perl6.org is, I think

[10:29] <pmurias> doc.perl6.org seems to be a mixture of more introductory material and a method reference

[10:30] <pmurias> as a user of other languages I find reading the spec usefull to the full way how things are supposed to behave

[10:31] *** dakkar joined
[10:33] <jnthn> pmurias: You are not a typical user.

[10:34] <jnthn> Or at least, I've had my share of blank looks from other devs when a language question comes up and I say, "let's check the language spec". :)

[10:35] <jnthn> (In languages besides Perl 6, I should add...)

[10:36] *** kbaker joined
[10:36] * jnthn will happily go find answers in language specs, but it doesn't seem to be a typical thing

[10:38] <moritz> also most users ask themselves questions like "I have the list and what turn it into a string; are there any handy methods for that?"

[10:39] <moritz> so a user-oriented doc should include methods from superclasses and roles (at least as links)

[10:39] <moritz> those aren't interesting for an implementor

[10:42] <moritz> and stuff like http://perlcabal.org/syn/S04.html#When_is_a_closure_not_a_closure simply isn't for users :-)

[10:47] <pmurias> one thing that could be usefull is to have links in the more user oriented docs to the relevant synopsis parts

[10:47] <moritz> agreed

[15:33] <colomon> cognominal: …. that seem like some dodgy logic to me.  I mean, I have no problem accepting that the Bible has been told and retold and meddled with.  But the idea that the closest they've come to finding camels in the periods depicted in the Bible is "decades" sounds extremely weak.

[15:37] <cognominal> I don't know the accuracy of radiocarbon dating

[15:41] <FROGGS> <mudler> i think there is an error on the wiki, the Allomorphic Types in Rakudo 6 it's pointing to Google-at-Home github page

[16:48] <japhb__> raydiak: re: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-02-12#i_8271967 I did try to tune the basic heuristics to give a reasonable type graph at a readable size in most cases (just about any type graph you check should at least be *useable* if not ideal), but I didn't try to do an iterative algorithm like checking the output from graphviz, noticing it produced oddly proportioned results, and then tweaking the inputs.

[16:51] <japhb__> My one request if you decide to tweak the coloring of the typegraphs is that it work well for color blind people like myself, and try not to be excessively showy.  I tend to like clear, clean, and subtle if possible (but I'm not a designer, so I can't do an ideal job myself).

[16:54] <japhb__> hoelzro: re: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8901287 , it might help to format the OK/NOT OK list at the bottom with a two column table, so the NOT OK stand out better.

[21:30] <btyler> hi all. trying to get panda going on moarvm: just running 'bootstrap' runs into the hang that FROGGS++ noted earlier while compiling Ecosystem.pm. I can get past that by using a moar-hacked ufo to makefile compile/install panda's deps (JSON, File::Find, Shell::Command), and then using a ufo makefile to make panda. however! panda compiles up until "Panda.pm" and I get 'STable conflict detected during deserialization; probable att

[22:51] <daxim> I have a problem with nqp 2014.01.  when building with NQP_LIB_DIR set, then running nqp-j will output "Error: Could not find or load main class nqp"

[22:51] <timotimo> that seems more like a classpath piece missing

[22:52] <timotimo> that error probably happens way before anything that'd look at NQP_LIB_DIR

[22:53] <daxim> no, even when I explicitly export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java, it will have the same error

[22:54] <daxim> my build conf is at https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:ldieckow:branches:devel:languages:parrot/nqp/nqp.spec?expand=1
