[00:06] <psch> feel free to look at it whenever 

[00:07] <psch> vendethiel: wrt todos i think you're best served with rt.perl.org

[11:42] <jnthn> I wonder if we couldn't do it in at_pos...

[11:42] <lizmat> but I guess that's a non int candidate

[11:43] <jnthn> Plus we have typed candidates there...

[11:43] <jnthn> So the check can be cheaper too.

[11:43] <lizmat> no checking in at_pos apparently

[11:44] <lizmat> jnthn: sorry, I lost you know

[11:44] <jnthn> lizmat: Where? :)

[11:45] <lizmat> so should I look into doing it at compile time?  that would only work for literal "-1"

[11:45] <jnthn> lizmat: Oh, I just meant I think at_pos has int and Int variants, though I guess postcircumfix does too...

[11:45] <lizmat> yes

[11:45] <lizmat> it does

[11:45] <jnthn> lizmat: Well, STD did it for -2 too...

[11:45] <jnthn> lizmat: But I think there's 2 things here really...

[11:45] <lizmat> well, ye, any <0 int I would think 

[11:45] <jnthn> 1) Move the checks into at_pos/assign_pos/bind_pos

[11:46] <eiro>  hello #perl6 

[11:46] <jnthn> 2) Implement the compile-time check, for STD convergence and better user experience

[11:46] <lizmat> but at the at_pos level, we don't see the difference between -1 and *-1 on an empty array

[11:46] <lizmat> eiro o/

[11:47] *** anaeem1 joined
[11:47] <jnthn> lizmat: Oh...and what're we menat to do on *-1 on empty?

[11:47] * jnthn tries to find the applicable spec

[11:50] <jnthn> ugh, yeah...

[11:50] <lizmat> found it ?   left up to the implementation ?

[11:51] <eiro> is there a way to improve the verbosity of the regex debuger ?

[11:51] <jnthn> Well, it seems it really don't want @a[$i_that_happens_to_be_minus_1]

[11:51] <jnthn> to work

[11:51] <jnthn> But @a[*-1] on empty shouldn't complain

[11:51] *** chenryn left
[11:52] <jnthn> So yeah, you're right. It's not so easy to move the check. Grrr.

[11:52] <lizmat> indeed... :-(

[11:52] <jnthn> eiro: In what way is it not verbose enough?

[11:52] <lizmat> well, we can haz multiple checks

[11:53] <jnthn> I'm trying to reduce the number of places we have to check stuff...

[11:54] *** Gothmog_ left
[11:54] <jnthn> eiro: iirc, you can also use $/ to try and get the current state of the match object

[11:54] <sergot> Could somebody tell me if one is able to panda install OpenSSL without any problems? :)

[11:55] <lizmat> but throwing a compile time error for [-1] would be better than a runtime error, no?

[11:57] <jnthn> lizmat: Oh, yes... I was more worrying about runtime in terms of checks :)

[11:57] *** kivutar joined
[12:00] <eiro> jnthn, i guess the debugger is verbose enough in most cases. What i want to do there is understand why the grammar subparse fall into an infinite loop

[14:26] <lucas_> one()  #=> "matches" one thing

[14:26] <lucas_> any()  #=> "matches" one or two or more things

[14:26] <lucas_> many() #=> "matches" two or more things (but not just one)

[15:12] <carlin> but when panda/javakudo compiles the JAR it compiles the hard-coded string

[15:12] <carlin> so it installs, passes all tests but when used fails with: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library '/home/carlin/.panda-work/1405177512_1/blib/lib/crypt_blowfish.so'

[17:16] <timotimo> d'aaw so few commits today

[17:17] <carlin> postcirumfix adds an exclosing operator to the end of the thingy

[17:17] <cognominal> vendethiel,   it is interesting how expression are parsed.   I was surprised when I discovered that composite stuff like  function arguments are treated almost like a vulgar ++ postfix except that their syntactical category is postcircumfix instead of postfix

[17:17] <cognominal> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/HLL/Grammar.nqp#L22

[17:17] <vendethiel> yeah, I know.

[20:34] <Mouq> vendethiel: known bug :(

[20:34] <yoleaux> 11 Jul 2014 04:13Z <atroxaper> Mouq: Actually I hope my solution would be better than current Pod::To::HTML. I would like you to look at my Pod::SAX and current Pod::SAX::Goes::HTML at https://github.com/atroxaper/Pod-SAX

[20:34] <vendethiel> Mouq: RT#66892, I know

[20:36] * vendethiel is preaching Perl 6 to some guy that asked him which PHP framework to use

[21:27] <vendethiel> friend: "Your slides look great. I still had that vision that perl was 'hasbeen'". me: "well, yeah, for p5 maybe. But p6 is totally new, they started writing specs aroudn the same time as py3"

[21:28] <vendethiel> ^ that's the answer I hear most of the times

[21:28] <vendethiel> "wow, I thought perl was from the past" (:(.) " but p6 looks great" (:).)

[21:32] * vendethiel is quite pleased, because everybody who read some p6 code found it nice. Just not with one-liners so much :-P

[21:32] <vendethiel> #perl6++

[21:36] <masak> vendethiel++

[21:37] <ren1us> usually if i show my friends any code i write, in any language, they just look befuddled, lol.  i do find that people really like it when they see how much of a sandbox it really is.

[21:40] <vendethiel> ren1us: I show perl 6 code to people that code :P

[21:40] <vendethiel> I wouldn't show a language with sigils to people that don't code

[21:41] <ren1us> vendethiel: I show code to people who falsely claim to code and have been in computer science classes with me for years

[21:41] <vendethiel> and they can't code ?

[21:41] <ren1us> not well.

[21:43] <ren1us> that's actually something that i've been finding more and more.  colleges don't teach good coding.  you get some in intro level and occasionally 'data structures' courses, but i keep seeing juniors and seniors with a 400 line main method in their java code

[21:43] <vendethiel> :(

[21:43] <vendethiel> even programming schools don't teach testing and stuff...

[21:44] <masak> learning to code well is hard.

[21:44] <vendethiel> rather than hard, you need to want it. That's like everything else. If you think you'll ever do okay with your 400-lines main, then why even try ?

[21:44] <ren1us> people who learn in high school tend to be much better about things like actual coding conventions and writing short, elegant code.  i think it's because in universities, the coding is taught as a mechanism to displaying concepts, whereas in high school, they're teaching coding for coding
