[00:00] * TimToady doesn't even see where <.foo()> is parsed, offhand

[00:00] <TimToady> must be coming from deeper down

[00:01] <jnthn> Inherited from QRegex::P6Regex::Grammar iirc

[00:02] <TimToady> if we just change that to parse EXPR instead of variable, will it magically do the right thing with <&foo('stuff')> ?

[00:02] <TimToady> the other is obviously a different bug

[00:02] <TimToady> that is, the :var variant

[00:02] <Quom> TimToady: Doubt it :(

[00:02] <Quom> TimToady: I was looking at the code yesterday

[00:02] <jnthn> Is it a parsing bug, or is it that the re-write done with we have a lexical rule messes things up?

[00:03] <Quom> In... Cursor.pm?

[00:03] <Quom> But maybe I'm completely wrong

[00:03] <TimToady> the <&foo()> is a parsing bug, the <foo()> is a rewrite problem, likely

[00:03] <rurban> I get the same t/nativecall/01-basic.t problem with 32bit cygwin also

[00:03] <rurban> I'll look at it tomorrow

[00:03] <Quom> rurban++ again :)

[00:03] *** Quom is now known as Mouq

[00:04] <TimToady> <&foo('bar')> attempts to parse with the MAIN variable rule, which of course can't understand the postfix

[00:04] <TimToady> the <foo('bar')> actually makes the call, but fails to pass the arguments

[00:04] <rurban> I like my new smokers: http://perl514.cpanel.net:8010/one_line_per_build

[00:06] <jnthn> TimToady: Only in the lexical case, though?

[00:07] <TimToady> presumably

[00:08] <TimToady> I think we rely on passing args sometimes in the method case

[00:08] <lue> r: grammar G { token TOP { <multiple(2.3)> }; token multiple($by) { (\-? <digit>+ [\. <digit>+]?) <?{ (+$0 / $by).narrow ~~ Int }> } }; G.parse("4.6").say;  # jnthn: works here

[00:08] <jnthn> Well, yeah, and the Rakudo grammar does it plenty too :)

[00:10] *** pdcawley left
[00:11] <lue> jnthn: that's why I was initially confused as to why the my token version failed :) "but Grammar.nqp can do it!"

[00:11] <jnthn> Urgh

[00:11] <jnthn> INTERPOLATE doesn't know what to do with args. Worse, it uses args to convey stuff it needs to know to delegate correctly.

[00:12] <jnthn> I suspect we shouldn't be using that here, though.

[00:16] <jnthn> > my token foo($bar = "oops") { foo {say $bar} }; say "foo" ~~ /<foo("baz")>/

[00:16] <jnthn> baz

[00:16] <TimToady> \o/

[00:16] <jnthn> Guess I should spectest :)

[00:16] <TimToady> me is testing a parsing patch for <&foo()>

[00:16] * jnthn is kinda ready for sleep :)

[00:17] <lue> I have a grammar fix that's about ready to be committed and pushed too :D

[00:17] <jnthn> Got all day tomorrow for Perl 6 things. Planning to work on Moar nativecall and maybe some Star prep bits.

[00:18] *** telex joined
[00:19] <jnthn> np

[00:19] <jnthn> I'm not especially fast tonight either :)

[00:19] <TimToady> one can force <&foo()> to parse by changing it to use EXPR at a= precedence, but the semantics are wrong, since it wants it to return the function pointer to call

[00:20] <TimToady> when it thinks of it as a variable

[00:20] <TimToady> so that will also take a deeper solution

[16:00] <colomon> japhb__: and my second answer doesn't work -- it's effectively also calling uniq on the array

[16:01] <colomon> of course, if it really is a set in meaning anyway...

[16:31] <lizmat> while working again on S11/S22, I'm coming to the conclusion that "auth" (such as cpan:JRANDOM)

[16:32] <lizmat> is really a combination of "authority" and "userid"

[16:32] <lizmat> and that "author" would be an optional (possibly real name) of the author / last maintainer

[16:33] <lizmat> to add to this, I think we need to split off the content delivery part from the authority

[16:33] <lizmat> CPAN in Perl 5 is an example of being an authority *and* a content delivery

[16:34] <lizmat> what we're doing now at the QA hackathon, is starting to use CPAN as a content delivery system, but not yet as an authority

[16:34] <lizmat> the current Perl6 ecosystem / panda, is an example of an authority only

[16:34] <lizmat> the content delivery there is done by github

[16:34] <TimToady> we mainly have to be careful to preserve the concept of "identity", so we never accidentally install two different things thinking they're the same thing

[16:35] <TimToady> but github hashes mostly solve that

[16:36] <lizmat> so the combination of the auth cpan:JRANDOM and ver 1.0 would be an identity ?

[16:36] <TimToady> well, and the module name

[16:36] <lizmat> of course, yes

[16:36] <TimToady> that's assuming cpan never allows v1.0 to be redefined

[16:36] <TimToady> but maybe we should be pushing cpan toward cryptochecksums

[16:37] <lizmat> techincally, PAUSE only checks the names of tarballs

[16:37] <lizmat> you can only upload a tarball with the same name once

[16:38] <lizmat> PAUSE already does checksums (SHA1, SHA256 and MD5)

[16:38] *** kaare__ joined
[16:39] <lizmat> in my view, an authority is responsible for selecting the content for a given distribution request

[16:40] <lizmat> specifically, if there is *no* auth and/or no version, it should give the content that is best for the requestor

[16:40] <lizmat> whatever the authority decides is best

[16:40] <lizmat> in the Perl 5 CPAN case, this is from the module list

[16:41] <TimToady> that is something different from auth, so should probably have a different name

[16:41] <lizmat> for Perl 6 I was thinking we need to generalize that into functionality that an authority (CPAN / ecosystem / some company's own authority) would mean

[16:41] <TimToady> it's something that decides what a wildcard auth meatns

[16:41] <TimToady> *means

[16:41] <lizmat> indeed

[16:42] <TimToady> auth as a concept has nothing to do with retrieval, only who says what that name/version mean exactly

[16:42] <TimToady> mixing that up with retrieval seems like a confusion to me

[16:43] <TimToady> yes, it's a kind of authority, but I'd rather give it a different name to avoid confusion

[16:43] <lizmat> ecosystem ?

[16:44] <TimToady> well, it's a decider of wildcards, like a path searcher, or some such

[16:44] <TimToady> it's a recommender, an oracle, a travel agent

[16:45] <lizmat> hmmm...  I see this process as non-automatic, essentially community driven

[16:45] <TimToady> it's an editorial function, yes

[16:45] <TimToady> it's like an editor picking which authors you get to read

[16:46] <lizmat> use Novel;

[16:46] <lizmat> indeed

[16:46] <lizmat> however, this is not during runtime, this is to pick for installation

[16:46] <lizmat> once it is installed, we already have all bases covered (I think)

[16:47] <TimToady> it's like a book's identity is its author, its name, its revision

[16:47] <TimToady> that's the S11 meaning of auth

[16:47] *** ajr_ left
[16:47] <TimToady> just that some authors are, like, companies or groups

[16:47] <lizmat> indeed, but if somebody says: "give me a good book on Foo", which one will one get ?

[16:47] <TimToady> but we should keep the publishing/bookselling as a separate concept

[16:50] *** treehug8_ left
[16:50] <arnsholt> I think it should be mostly a matter of putting in the elbow-grease (knock on wood)

[16:51] <TimToady> you need such editorial control not just at the community level, but at the company level as well, maybe more so than community control even

[16:51] <TimToady> since companies tend to be more risk adverse than the community

[16:51] <lizmat> I was using community in a loose sense here

[16:52] <TimToady> okay, just wanted to make sure the concept stays multi-level :)

[16:52] <lizmat> the way I see it, is that the first part of the auth

[16:52] <lizmat> is something that indicates what I just called "authority"

[16:52] <lizmat> but maybe "ecosystem" is better

[16:52] *** pecastro left

[16:53] <lizmat> true

[16:53] <lizmat> but we need something here to really have things starting to work

[16:53] <TimToady> think about how URLs work; editorial work is almost always done with other people's URLs, not one's own

[16:53] <jnthn> arnsholt: Awesome. Did you see my "why things don't quite work on Windows for perl6-j NativeCall" from yesterday?

[16:54] <TimToady> so trying to read more into the URL than original authorship would be mistake

[16:54] <TimToady> same with the "cpan:" or the "github" prefix, it should only be identity, not editorial

[16:55] <lizmat> so you would only see CPAN and github as content delivery systems

[16:55] <lizmat> or any place where to get distributions

[16:55] <TimToady> and how would you pick between those if the editor has to be one or the other?

[16:55] <lizmat> and just have a single editor ?

[16:56] <skids> .oO(other environments use "publisher")

[16:56] <TimToady> would just prefer that the editor not be given a name that would confuse it with "auth"

[16:56] <TimToady> which is more of a URL concept

[16:56] <lizmat> when you're installing a module, you most likely already have selected the content delivery system to install from

[16:57] <TimToady> sure, but there are maybe two different things called 'cpan' here.  or maybe the auth should be 'pause:' instead of 'cpan:'

[16:58] <lizmat> indeed, the content delivery part, and the part that tells you which distribution to download for "Foo" (any author/any version)

[20:27] <lue> jnthn: I think I may just want $<EXPR>.CURSOR.pos

[20:28] <lue> jnthn: I feel silly. I'm not actually using <culprit> :P

[20:30] <lue> jnthn: STD uses <culprit> to accomplish an error message with two "this is the code that fails" things; I opted for making existing error functions do that for me, thus negating the need for culprit.
