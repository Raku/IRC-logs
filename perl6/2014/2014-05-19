[17:14] <[Coke]> if I build rakudo star for moarvm, does it download a copy of moar when I build NQP?

[17:14] <moritz> [Coke]: iirc star bundles moarvm

[17:19] <FROGGS> should be bundled, aye

[17:19] <FROGGS> but you can replace that with a git clone, and build star-HEAD that way

[17:22] <[Coke]> I am cheating; trying to figure out if my cheating is the problem. (moarvm stuff not ending up the star target's manifest)

[18:53] <Kays> will Perl 5 be somewhat compatible with Perl 6 similar to C and C++? As in use both Perl 5 and Perl 6 in the same project?

[18:54] *** vike joined
[18:55] <PerlJam> Kays: not exactly

[18:55] <PerlJam> Kays: there are mechanisms in the works for using Perl 5 code from Perl 6

[18:55] <PerlJam> Kays: but Perl 6 is not a superset of Perl 5 like C++ is of C

[18:56] *** anaeem1 left
[18:58] <Kays> I see. Thanks PerlJam 

[18:58] <vendethiel> C++ would have been far better off not being compatible with C, tbh ...

[18:58] <Kays> vendethiel: why? A lot of things will break.

[18:59] <geekosaur> probably, but as it started out as a preprocessor for C (cfront)...

[18:59] <backlash_jack> some might say that C++ is what's broken

[18:59] <vendethiel> because C++ just reinvents stuff on top of C stuff, lots of duplication, etc

[18:59] <vendethiel> (and yeah, C++ is not a superset of C because C++ keywords bla bla bla)

[18:59] <vendethiel> (also the () vs (void))

[20:14] <lizmat> hmmm... seeing segfault in S05-transliteration/with-closure.t after pull

[20:16] <lizmat> dwarring++ for fixing Temporal, but do we have a test for +> that fails ?

[20:17] <lizmat> S05-transliteration/trans also segfaults on maor

[20:18] <lizmat> integration/advent2009-day09.t   also segfaults  :-(

[20:18] <timotimo> now i'm at my laptop and can start working on the weekly post

[20:18] <yoleaux> 12:43Z <FROGGS> timotimo: there is at least one thing for the p6weekly: the v5 module does not require a patched rakudo anymore, and can be installed using its configure script + make...

[20:18] <lizmat> as does integration/real-strings.t   :-(((

[20:18] <yoleaux> 12:44Z <FROGGS> timotimo: and I am working hard on making it a pandable module

[20:19] <FROGGS> lizmat: looks like speshbugs to me

[20:20] <lizmat> will see if MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 makes a difference

[20:28] <lizmat> FROGGS: indeed, they all seem to be SPESH related as with MVM_SPESH_DISABLE=1 they do *not* segfault

[20:28] <lizmat> jnthn: ^^^

[20:31] <lizmat> well, we were on the road most of today:  Poznan -> Berlin -> Dresden -> Prague

[20:32] <lizmat> and afaik he's now working on his slides for a presentation on Wed

[20:32] <nwc10> is that the fastest route?

[20:32] <lizmat> yes, the fastest

[20:32] <lizmat> about 100km more than the direct route

[20:33] <lizmat> but instead of doing 120km/hour average, you would be lucky to make 80km/hour average
