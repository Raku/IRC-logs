[00:25] <japhb__> moritz: Regarding http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-03-19#i_8463201 , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdichotomous_model .  So brrt's intuitive sense of integer arithmetic as constant-time is true under the transdichotomous model ... which is to say, native machine words of problem-appropriate size.

[10:31] *** mls joined
[10:34] <IllvilJa> Just searched for 'rakudo' in 'Ubuntu Software Center' and look and behold, there was a package!

[10:34] <tadzik> :)

[10:35] <tadzik> col

[10:35] <tadzik> it's 2013.03 in my ubuntu

[10:35] <IllvilJa> Last time I checked (actually years ago but still), there was no rakudo, at least not in Redhat or in Gentoo.  One had to download and install it outside of the package/software manager included in the system.

[10:36] <nwc10> This is perl6 version 2013.12 built on parrot 5.9.0 revision 0

[10:36] <IllvilJa> That means it is easier to start writing FOSS software in Perl6 and just tell users "install rakudo and get rolling!"

[10:36] <nwc10> that's on this rather new desktop

[10:36] <nwc10> arnsholt: did I miss some key line on IRC about what your hopefully-faster branch does differently to be faster?

[10:39] <arnsholt> nwc10: Probably didn't say explicitly

[10:39] <nwc10> aha. That would explain a lot :-)

[10:40] <arnsholt> For historical reasons (there was a process boundary between the two steps initially), the JAST tree (JVM specific syntax tree) in NQP is dumped to string before being converted to bytecode

[10:40] <FROGGS> ohh dear

[10:40] <arnsholt> Of course, now that the process boundary is gone it makes no sense to dump the tree to strings just to reparse it back to create the bytecode

[10:40] <FROGGS> and I thought that this is a parrotism :o)

[10:40] <arnsholt> The Parrot thing is a bit different, actually, but sort of similar yeah

[10:41] <FROGGS> yeah

[10:41] <arnsholt> Reason is that in the earliest days of the JVM backend, NQP/Parrot did the parsing and generated the JAST tree, while a new NQP/JVM process reparsed the dumped JAST and made the bytecode

[10:42] <arnsholt> So back then it had to be like that. Of course, when the process disappeared, the easiest thing to do was to just glue the two bits together =)

[10:42] * FROGGS feels kinda strange to paste output of rakudo to a #perl-* channel, but somehow a good kind of strange

[10:42] <arnsholt> nwc10: Anyways, feel free to give the branch a go

[10:43] <arnsholt> I suspect it'll fail if you try to run Rakudo's testsuite, but I'm not entirely sure what's going on there

[10:43] <FROGGS> arnsholt: does it fail faster? *g*

[10:43] <FROGGS> err, do you see a recognizable improvement for stuff that works?

[10:43] <arnsholt> Haven't looked, really

[10:44] <arnsholt> But it'll mostly be an improvement for Rakudo's setting compile, I think

[10:44] <arnsholt> It's a compile-time thing, not a run-time thing

[10:45] <FROGGS> yes, I see

[10:46] *** sqirrel_ left

[11:25] <nwc10> arnsholt: most strangely, it fails all but the first Rakudo test run.

[11:25] <nwc10> So /usr/local/bin/perl t/harness --jvm  t/01-sanity/01-literals.t  t/01-sanity/02-op-math.t

[11:25] <nwc10> first passes, second fails

[11:25] <nwc10> /usr/local/bin/perl t/harness --jvm  t/01-sanity/02-op-math.t  t/01-sanity/03-op-logic.t

[11:26] <nwc10> first passes, second fails, despite the fact that the test t/01-sanity/02-op-math.t failed previously

[11:28] <jnthn> What's it fail with ooc?

[11:28] <jnthn> It's not that the JAST tree nodes are being over-shared, I guess?

[11:34] <arnsholt> That'd be weird. Pretty sure it doesn't keep any references to the JAST being compiled

[11:35] <jnthn> arnsholt: I more meant the types

[11:35] <arnsholt> Oh, that can be it, yeah

[11:36] <arnsholt> It saves away references to the typeobjects on the first compile

[11:36] <jnthn> That'd do it.

[11:36] <jnthn> They're different for different compiles

[11:36] <jnthn> Everything gets its own isolated deserialize, even on eval server, since anything can potentially be augmented, mutated, etc.

[11:37] <arnsholt> Yeah, I didn't think about the eval server

[11:37] <jnthn> It's not only that

[11:37] <jnthn> Oh, it is actually

[11:37] <jnthn> :)

[11:37] <jnthn> Was gonna say something about eval and threads, but of course the threads share it.

[11:39] <arnsholt> Heh

[11:40] <arnsholt> I'll give that a whack tonight, probably

[16:50] <[Coke]> are we pretty much dedicated to a monthly star release at this point?

[16:50] <[Coke]> I know in the past we had said ad hoc.

[16:54] <jnthn> [Coke]: Given the current velocity, I think monthly will continue to make sense for a while.

[16:54] <[Coke]> Anyone mind if I create perl6.github.com ?

[16:54] <moritz> [Coke]: what will you put on it?

[16:54] <[Coke]> jnthn: fair enough. when plotting out milestones, wanted to have monthlies for the compiler, will add them for star as well.

[16:55] <moritz> I don't mind, just want to avoid fragementation of the websites; but if there's a good reason, go for it

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: In some cases, the fixup to the role outer would not be done. On the

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Parrot and JVM backends, things "magically" work out due to keeping

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: track of a prior invocation. Moar's stricter closure model (which the

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: JVM backend should also move to) lacks the "magic", and so highlighted

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: the reliance on it. This fixes things for on MoarVM, but leaves alone

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: JVM and Parrot's current approach given we're right up against the

[18:02] <dalek> rakudo/nom: monthly release; after the release, they can all switch to the same,

[20:16] <masak> it all makes a lot of sense. doesn't make me like PHP more, but probably makes life loads easier for the Facebook folks.

[20:58] <FROGGS> tadzik: done, now I am rerunning spectests

[20:59] <tadzik> ok, they're your responsibility now :P

[20:59] <tadzik> (I'm serious)

[20:59] <FROGGS> sure

[21:00] <Goodbox> I was sometimes reading articles from "Les mongeurs de Perl" which were published in linuxmag's. About my personnal preferencies, i find python really snicky (and so slow), (But far from me the idea to start a troll)

[21:02] <masak> Goodbox: people have all sorts of preferences. Perl 6 is for people who like expressive power, lexical scoping, and extensibility.

[21:02] <cognominal> GoodBox, the mongueurs hangout is #perlfr on irc.perl.org :)

[21:03] <cognominal> and we have "les journées Perl" in June :  http://journeesperl.fr/fpw2014/

[21:03] <Goodbox> Thank's cognominal ! I guess, knowing me, having more florescence using perl families languages ;)

[21:04] <Goodbox> cognominal: Nice! Plan to go to the RMLL's ?

[21:04] <cognominal> I don't know.

[21:05] <cognominal> where are you? In France?

[21:05] <grondilu> cognominal: will there be talks about Perl 6?

[21:05] <Goodbox> (Yes, I first join english communities beacause I have to prictice :p) cognominal I'm from the east of France and I plan to go at Montpellier with some french librist's :)

[21:06] <cognominal> grondilu, it is up to you :) and people in this channel. I am not sure to attend :(

[21:07] <cognominal> I wish I would be sure.

[21:08] <grondilu> well, there aren't many french people in this channel, are there?  You and me are the only one I know, IIRC.

[21:08] <cognominal> elbeho told me  fpw is almost at the same time as YAPC::NA  :(

[21:11] <cognominal> grondilu, I am working on articles about Perl 6 for the french linuxmag. If you are interested to collaborate... Witth rakudo star supporting moarvm, it will be a good time to publsh

[21:13] <grondilu> cognominal: I suggest you wait until MoarVM supports conc.

[21:13] <grondilu> then you'll have even more pretty cool stuff to talk about

[21:13] <cognominal> conc?

[21:13] <nwc10> concurrency

[21:13] <grondilu> concurrency

[21:13] <nwc10> I think that jnthn hopes to have it in for April

[21:14] <nwc10> how frequently does the magazine come out? and what are its publication deadline dates?

[21:15] <cognominal> We need to give an article at the end of the month to get it publish for the next month.

[21:15] <japhb__> jnthn: I've recently started loading down r-j enough with threads to result in some instability (errors coming up when they don't at lower loads).  However, I've yet to golf it down to A) something easy to reproduce, and B) prove that it isn't something external to r-j that is failing (since the program in question spawns many dozens of subprocess pipes).  Do we have any existing threading load-tests for Rakudo?

[21:15] <grondilu> as cann have been observed on perlmonks, whenever you talk about MoarVM, people go "meh, yet another dead end" or something.  So I think you really need to have something spectacular to show off before bothering them.

[21:16] <nwc10> cognominal: how many articles do you think you will be writing?

[21:16] <nwc10> sorry if I seem to be all questions

[21:17] <jnthn> japhb__: No, we don't. BUT I do know that there can be issues with regards to not having switched over to the thread-safer coderef stuff in JVM.

[21:17] *** brrt joined
[21:17] <jnthn> japhb__: You may be hitting that. I'd love to say "try it on Moar" but ENOTYET.

[21:17] <jnthn> japhb__: Since Moar has the right model.

[21:17] <japhb__> Ah, OK.  Was this the stuff that you said in your recent commit you'll need to do after the release is cut?

[21:17] * masak finds much of the debate over "crumbling foundations" truly interesting in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7436401

[21:17] <japhb__> jnthn: Yep, understood.

[21:17] <cognominal> I have one which use rosalind as example to talk about strings and a little about OO. I have others that have bitrotten

[21:18] <masak> best way to describe the whole situation -- that I've found thus far -- is Kent Beck's phrase "clean code that works". you can have either "clean code" or "that works", or both, and much discusssion will happen between the two camps that have found one but not the other.

[21:19] <nwc10> cognominal: ah OK, these are general Perl 6 articles? Rather than "new news" articles?

[21:19] <jnthn> japhb__: No, the thing I fixed there was a case of "Moar caught us cheating".

[21:19] * japhb__ suddenly wonders if he's managing to spawn *so* many subprocess pipes that he's actually starting to run into FD limits or some such and the errors are just LTA.

[21:19] <japhb__> jnthn: ;-D

[21:20] <brrt> masak - it's a good discussion isn't it

[21:20] <masak> moritz: http://i.imgur.com/F0t5T21.png :)

[21:20] * grondilu opens his eyes wide at the |args syntax on http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton#Perl_6 

[21:21] <masak> brrt: for a long time, I had big problems with "clean code" vs "that works", because it seemed that both camps have a point. well, it turns out they do, and you can have both, and it's not obvious that you can, and that's why there are long discussions about this.

[21:21] <FROGGS> grondilu: about the "yet another dead end": when you state what improvements moarvm brought us, then nobody can still think it is a dead end :o)

[21:21] <lue> masak: distressing is the fact that 50% of all mentions of 2048 were misspelled :)

[21:22] <lue> (in that png you shared)

[21:22] <masak> lue: I suspect the screenshot is a fake :)

[21:24] <lue> meanwhile, xkcd mentioned 2048, and I keep coming back to it (worse, I see potential mathematical questions, like "what is the largest tile you can have?" etc. :P)

[21:24] *** kaare__ is now known as kaare_

[21:25] <masak> lue: what *is* the largest tile you can have?

[21:26] <lue> masak: my guess is ∞, like Hanoi. (You can solve a three-peg hanoi with any amount of disks; the shortest solution is just 2**n steps, IIRC)

[21:27] <tadzik> argh

[21:27] <tadzik> jvm is failing a lot of stuff

[21:27] <moritz> lue: no, you can't

[21:28] <tadzik> https://gist.github.com/tadzik/9674264

[21:28] <masak> lue: no, there has to be an upper limit.

[21:28] <masak> lue: because there's finite room, and it runs out.

[21:28] <moritz> lue: you are limited to 2 ** ($n + 2), where $n is number of positions

[21:28] <lue> moritz: really? I recall that a three-peg hanoi could handle any amount of disks. I agree that's possibly not the case for 2048 though.

[21:28] <moritz> hanoi, yes. 2048, no

[21:29] <jnthn> tadzik: I can explain/take blame for one:

[21:29] <jnthn> t/spec/S17-concurrency/lock.t                              (Wstat: 0 Tests: 6 Failed: 0) Parse errors: Bad plan.  You planned 7 tests but ran 6.

[21:29] <jnthn> tadzik: I shoulda pushed that to a branch in roast, as the code that makes it pass is also in a branch.

[21:30] <FROGGS> tadzik: jvm always failed tests

[21:30] <lue> oh, right. In an absolutely perfect game, the largest would be 2**16 I think (imagine a snake of 15 blocks, each double the last, and a 2 appearing in the empty spot next to the existing 2)

[21:30] <FROGGS> tadzik: seems like this month's low was at 5

[21:31] <tadzik> oh

[21:31] <tadzik> so, should I just carry on with the release>

[21:32] <FROGGS> tadzik: in case I still can count we will end up with 9 failed tests (taking lock.t not into account)

[21:33] <jnthn> We should really clean these up, but it's no worse than in previous releases.

[21:33] *** brrt left
[21:33] <FROGGS> damnit, spectesting for something other than moar takes ages >.<

[21:36] *** colomon joined
[21:36] *** BenGoldberg joined
[21:37] <FROGGS> I guess `make manifest` does fail too?

[21:38] <japhb__> Something fun to show off serious concurrency + NativeCall: Something that draws a fractal by recursively spawning tasks to take smaller and smaller pieces of it until they hit one pixel, calculate it, *DRAW IT*, and then finish off.  Because seeing that in motion would be very fun.

[21:38] <tadzik> FROGGS: yes

[21:39] <tadzik> I dunno why though

[21:39] <FROGGS> tadzik: is the MANIFEST file locked by some process or so?

[21:39] <tadzik> the MANIFEST file is not empty

[21:39] <FROGGS> I cannot imagine what can fail in `find t/spec -type f | grep -v '\.git' >>MANIFEST`

[21:39] <FROGGS> and t/spec is a regular directory?

[21:39] <tadzik> um, no

[21:40] <tadzik> it's a symlink

[21:40] <tadzik> should probably be find t/spec/

[21:40] <FROGGS> maybe that confuddles it?

[21:40] <tadzik> ah, now it works :)

[21:40] <FROGGS> yay :o)

[21:42] <tadzik> http://feather.perl6.nl/~tjs/rakudo-2014.03.tar.gz

[21:42] <tadzik> please test

[21:43] <FROGGS> tadzik: btw, p-spectest is clean now, will test your tarball now

[21:44] <tadzik> awesmoe, thank you

[21:46] <BenGoldberg> japhb__ Why not just have a top-level task spawn one sub-task per pixel directly?  I don't see the benefit of recursion, here.

[21:47] <BenGoldberg> There would still be concurrency (all those subtasks calculating pixels), and there would still be NativeCall (drawing those pixels).

[21:48] * sjn gets an error when trying to build rakudo-2014.03 with a parrot background

[21:48] <sjn> backend*

[21:48] <japhb__> BenGoldberg: I left out some details.  I imagined information flowing between the layers via e.g. channels and such, and showing that multi-level task fanout doesn't result in one portion of the fractal blocking on some other portion.  (e.g. The first N tasks get assigned real threads, but then all other pixels start plodding through getting thread resources as if queued)

[21:50] <[Coke]> yup, that's fine, usually. it's looking for an existing parrot to use int eh build location, and noting it didn't.

[21:50] <sjn> how about quieting the warning, if it's fine?

[21:50] <japhb__> BenGoldberg: My inspiration was a visual, thread-based variation on this: http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/

[21:51] <japhb__> (But not needing to be obfuscated per se.  I'm not trying to create a sig JAPH.)

[21:51] <[Coke]> sjn: seems reasonable. did your build stop there, or did it continue? (also, you might want --gen-nqp also)

[21:51] <sjn> (it's the first line you get when running the first build instruction in the README file)

[21:51] <sjn> it seems to continue fine

[22:56] <yoleaux> I saw smls 25 Feb 2014 16:46Z in #perl6: <smls> :P

[22:56] <Mouq> .seen raydiak

[22:56] <yoleaux> I saw raydiak 7 Mar 2014 20:49Z in #perl6: <raydiak> isBEKaml: agreed, I can only imagine someone didn't want to add another dependency just for that one use

[23:07] <dalek> doc: lib/modules.pod Formatting tweaks

[23:07] <dalek> doc: review: https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/93563f5a93

[23:07] *** kivutar left

[23:26] <Mouq> http://doc.perl6.org/language/modules

[23:26] <Mouq> That's all copied from the wiki, and should probably face some editing, especially as we revamp S11/22

[23:27] <Mouq> But there ya' go

[23:27] <timotimo> better than having lost it, thanks!

[23:28] * timotimo changes modules.perl6.org to match the new url

[23:30] <timotimo> there we go.

[23:30] <dalek> modules.perl6.org: f9c8436 | (Timo Paulssen)++ | web/index.tmpl:

[23:30] <dalek> modules.perl6.org: link to where the modules creation guide lives now

[23:30] <dalek> modules.perl6.org: review: https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org/commit/f9c843676d

[23:31] <Mouq> \o/

[23:31] <Mouq> timotimo: Do you have the power to actually update modules.perl6.org though?

[23:31] <timotimo> i think it updates automatically regularly

[23:31] <timotimo> (last update 2014-03-20 23:17:26 GMT).

[23:31] <Mouq> It updates the modules list

[23:32] <Mouq> But I made a change a while ago that hasn't shown up

[23:32] <Mouq> Well, maybe I'm wrong

[23:32] <timotimo> oh

[23:33] <timotimo> maybe moritz will have to do it for us?

[23:33] <Mouq> But I don't see what I'd expect the change to be from https://github.com/perl6/modules.perl6.org/commit/ef1e109

[23:33] <Mouq> You mean moritz++? :9

[23:34] <timotimo> i do see that change show up

[23:36] * Mouq curls http://modules.perl6.org/ to check if his browser's just weird

[23:36] <Mouq> Mmm, still points to the ecosystem wiki

[23:37] <Mouq> You sure you're not reading the commit backwards?

[23:37] <Mouq> :P

[23:37] <timotimo> oh damn

[23:38] <timotimo> i was

[23:38] <Mouq> timotimo: Heh, I do that too :)
