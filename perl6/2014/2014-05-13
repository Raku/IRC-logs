[06:49] <yoleaux> FROGGS: I'll pass your message to raiph.

[06:50] <FROGGS> jnthn: you feel like deciding things already? :o) http://irclog.perlgeek.de/moarvm/2014-05-12#i_8712894

[06:53] <jnthn> FROGGS: Have you considered an approach like we have for blocks used in handlers?

[06:54] <FROGGS> jnthn: what blocks?

[06:54] <jnthn> (that is, it's put by code-gen into a specific register, and we include the register number in the frame handler)?

[06:54] <jnthn> The handler blocks.

[06:54] <FROGGS>     /* Register containing block to invoke, for invokey handlers. */

[06:54] <jnthn> We do it that way to get closure semantics correct.

[06:54] <FROGGS>     MVMuint16 block_reg;

[06:54] <jnthn> right, that.

[06:55] <FROGGS> hmmm

[06:55] <FROGGS> will have to take a look how that works

[06:55] <FROGGS> but that sounds like I just need to write down + read the register number

[15:46] <TimToady> grondilu: I think using Test on http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Index_finite_lists_of_positive_integers#Perl_6 kind of obscures the round-trippiness that the previous output made visually clear; Test is a good thing, but not everything on RC has to use it...

[15:49] <TimToady> likewise, for instance, the output format of http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Order_disjoint_list_items#Perl_6 is chosen to put the output directly under the corresponding input so you can make a visual comparison, and using Test on that one would obscure that visual relationship

[17:52] <dalek> specs: 

[17:52] <dalek> specs: The word Application is entirely misleading for describing the

[17:52] <dalek> specs: various systems that form the execution context of your program, so

[17:52] <dalek> specs: instead we'll have the role Systemic to express the notion of some

[17:52] <dalek> specs: local system that we're running in the context of (operating system,

[17:52] <dalek> specs: kernel, architecture, physical machine, virtual machine, virtual OS,

[17:52] <dalek> specs: maybe even windowing system).

[17:52] <dalek> specs: 

[17:52] <dalek> specs: We also split out the role Universal to be done by any object that

[17:52] <dalek> specs: needs a cosmically unique name.  The version must be well formed in

[17:52] <dalek> specs: order to be suitable for naming.  Other version-like info can go into

[17:52] <dalek> specs: a description instead (or, if it must be part of the name somehow,

[17:52] <dalek> specs: into the auth attribute).  The crypto signature may or may not end

[17:52] <dalek> specs: up being optional for various kinds of entities.  A physical architecture

[19:31] <jnthn> lue: No, I don't even get that far.

[19:31] <FROGGS> this parses MIRRORED.BY, ping every host and spits out the ten fastest... the entire script fits on my laptop screen

[19:32] <lue> Ah. Well, that's where I fail, every one of panda's test files gets a red "No subtests run", and then the test summary complains "Parse errors: No plan found in TAP output" for each one.

[19:32] <moritz> TimToady: it emits the todo() call in the right place

[19:32] <moritz> TimToady: but lexical proximity doesn't seem to be enough with those concurrency tests

[19:32] <vendethiel> FROGGS: you must have a wide screen :p

[19:33] <FROGGS> vendethiel: no really, that is a very readable font size here :o)

[19:33] <TimToady> sounds like you want skip instead

[19:33] <TimToady> todo will still try to run things

[19:34] <FROGGS> which is not good for explody things

[19:34] <vendethiel> ooh given + postfix when is cool too ...

[19:34] <moritz> most don't explode, just fail

[19:34] <vendethiel> FROGGS: btw, couldn't .sort({$^a.value<ping> <=> $^b.value<ping>}) just be .sort(*.value<ping>) ?

[19:35] <moritz> only if .value<ping> is already numeric

[19:35] * moritz doesn't know any context

[19:35] <moritz> if not, it'd need to be +*.value<ping>

[19:36] <vendethiel> yeah, it is :)

[19:38] <TimToady> a ping race would be a good use for the NYI race context

[19:38] <TimToady> with todo, I suspect the count of tests to skip is not raceproof

[19:40] <TimToady> and something is probably tracking that number dynamically rather than lexically

[20:25] <vendethiel> *me links FROGGS++'s gist * "I was thinking about that in the afternoon -- I need to parse some stuff from a manpage, but my friend's doing it in python ..." "yeah, well he shoulnt, look at this C++11 grammar, less than 1k lines with all the weirdest things that exist!"

[20:25] * vendethiel looks up "conducive" in a dictionary

[20:26] <jnthn> OK, reboot time

[20:26] <jnthn> Just in case.

[20:26] <jnthn> This is ridiculous :/

[20:26] * TimToady would like to see a reboot out of the case

[20:27] <FROGGS> it is

[20:37] <masak> well, I always imagined that the king must have felt some measure of relief taking on the clothes of "just one of the men", and walking about, listening to the grassroots.

[20:37] <TimToady> a frank view from an outsider is something that famous people start to crave after a while

[20:38] <masak> I can imagine.

[20:46] <TimToady> great movie, pity it's only a mono soundtrack

[20:50] <moritz> though these days, Mark Knopfler seems to play "Piper to the End" at the end of his concerts instead

[21:40] <btyler> "issues" output is there just to show that I wasn't typoing the repo name or something

[21:40] <ingy> btyler: saw that bug last night

[21:40] <ingy> use issue-new 

[21:41] <ingy> or since you are inside git-hub repo just say `git hub issue`

[21:41] <btyler> oh, lovely. this is awesome

[21:41] <btyler> really? nice!

[21:41] <btyler> this is so cool

[21:41] <PerlJam> ingy++ (I've been playing too.  It  *is* really nice)

[21:42] <ingy> `git hub issue 39` shows an issue. So I made `git hub issue` call `git hub issue-new`

[21:42] <ingy> but that fails when you specify the owner/repo

[21:42] <PerlJam> ingy: btw, I just did "git hub members perl6" and it prompts me to press CTRL-C or Enter ... any reason you didn't just use an existing pager?  (or is there some config I set to make it do so?)

[21:43] <ingy> btyler: please add an issue for that :)

[21:43] <ingy> PerlJam: git hub members perl6 -a

[21:43] <ingy> there is a reason for it

[21:44] <hoelzro> ingy: where is this hub subcommand from?

[21:44] <PerlJam> hmm. -a == "all" doesn't immediately jump out at me that a pager would be used

[21:44] <ingy> if you had a really long list there's no way to tell it not to keep fetching

[21:44] <ingy> and you would burn your rate limit

[21:44] <PerlJam> makes sense

[21:45] <ingy> it's a compromise

[21:45] <ingy> I only recently got paging working in general

[21:45] <ingy> hoelzro: 21:41:23        ingy | git clone [email@hidden.address] export $PWD/git-hub/lib:$PATH; git hub setup

[21:49] <ingy> oh there are also plugins like git-hub-travis and git-hub-irc

[21:51] <ingy> PerlJam: I have a growing number of bash packages, so I made http://bpan.org ( bpan-org/bpan )

[21:51] <PerlJam> heh!

[21:51] <PerlJam> that's just too awesome

[21:51] <ingy> it's an amazingly simple CPAN thing built over git-hub

[23:07] <lizmat> good *, #perl6!

[23:07] <yoleaux> 19:16Z <moritz> lizmat: I'm unable to fudge those failing S17 tests, the TODO markers seem to end up on unrelated tests; any idea what to do, except removing them from t/spectest.data?

[23:08] <lizmat> moritz: if this is about S17-supply/uniq.t, that started segfaulting recently and is probably related to changes in Moar / nqp

[23:08] <lizmat> that one I haven't seen segafult with spesh disabled

[23:09] <lizmat> S17-supply/delay|stable are long standing problems that I want jnthn to have a look at when he has time again

[23:09] <lizmat> the reason they probably can't be fudged easily, is that they use "tap_ok", which is good for 5 tests

[23:10] <lizmat> 1. we must tell the fudger that tap_ok is 5 tests (how?)

[23:10] <lizmat> 2. when marking as "todo" we should be marking only some of the tests in tap_ok as todo

[23:10] <lizmat> (how?)

[23:10] <ingy> PerlJam: ping

[23:10] <lizmat> ideas / suggestions /comments welcome

[23:11] <lizmat> TimToady: saw the change Application -> Universal/Systemic, will look at it either tomorrow night, or at the hackathon

[23:43] <TimToady> lizmat: you're basically saying you want the ability to fudge .pm files as well as .t files, have a fudged .t file call the similarly fudged .pm file (to enable 2), and have any #?DOES from the .pm file propagate back to the .t file (to enable 1)
