[07:44] <TimToady> timotimo: looking for that ^^ maybe?

[07:44] <timotimo> oh, cute

[07:45] <TimToady> and to the first approximation, hypers on shaped arrays can ignore the shape, except to reproduce the shape on the result end

[07:45] <TimToady> but the distribution of the operations can view the elements as flat

[07:45] <timotimo> right, the flatness makes it quite a bit less complicated i think

[07:46] <TimToady> as long as none of the dimensions are extensible

[07:46] <TimToady> then we're back to pointerland

[07:46] <timotimo> yesterday i had code like "my @yoffs = ((100, 80, 45, 15) >>*>> nqp::time_n()) >>->> H;" or something similar

[07:46] <timotimo> it was oodles of times slower than the same code with an explicit for loop over that parcel

[07:48] <timotimo> and i'm just saying: in this particular case, we could have done much better - with a bunch of intelligence in place, yeah, but still ...

[07:49] <TimToady> I tend to use X* and X- in those cases

[07:49] <timotimo> ah, that's a good point

[07:50] <TimToady> then you can at least lose the parens around the list

[07:50] <TimToady> not that it would necessarily run any faster

[07:50] <timotimo> i could probably check the performance of that

[07:51] <TimToady> any metaop will have some setup and teardown overhead

[07:51] <FROGGS> and that won't go away once we multi-thread these

[07:52] <TimToady> in fact, deciding not to multithread will also be an overhead :)

[07:52] <FROGGS> true :o)

[07:52] <timotimo> hopefully we'll be able to decide those things at something similar to "spesh time" in many cases

[07:55] <TimToady> most of the GLR can be summarized as "wait till you have a known source and destination before you decide how to do it"

[07:55] <timotimo> i'd like to TL;DR that as "procrastinate! it's more efficient!"

[07:55] <FROGGS> yeah

[07:55] <TimToady> including such information as how long the list is known to be (finite or infinite too)

[07:56] * TimToady is developing a crossbar of how various source and dest policies interact

[07:59] *** fhelmberger joined
[08:02] <TimToady> probably the src will specify a list of acceptable policies in order of preference, and the dest will then pick one or more to negotiate with its downstream dest

[08:02] <TimToady> such that you cannot try to feed an infinite list to an "all" policy, even indirectly

[08:03] *** fhelmberger left
[08:05] <TimToady> this relates to jdv79++'s question about ranges as well

[08:06] <TimToady> currently a range will autobatch itself because that's much more efficient on average than doing the lazy range

[08:07] <timotimo> yeah, no matter how small the overhead is, simply generating "the next number" is probably always going to be darn cheap

[08:07] <TimToady> my current list api poliices are: lazy, batch, silo, all, sink, hyper and race

[08:08] <TimToady> the difference betwen batch and silo basically being sync vs async

[08:10] <timotimo> so silo behaves a bit like CSP?

[08:10] *** Hor|zon joined
[08:10] <TimToady> I think of it as a circular buffer with both a reader and a writer

[08:11] <timotimo> that's fair

[08:11] <TimToady> whereas with batch, it's "please produce as many as you can, up to N, then get back to me"

[08:12] <TimToady> either of batch or silo could have slow-start semantics too, adjusting the batch size as we know more about the data stream

[08:13] <TimToady> but hopefully, the GLR will also make pure lazy faster as well, since it can reduce to function calls just returning the next value, with no buffering overhead

[08:14] <TimToady> assuming we generate functions with sufficient state to track the interation of whatever we're iterating

[08:14] <timotimo> sounds just a tiny bit over-engineered :P

[08:14] <TimToady> well, but once we've got functions rather than methods, we get more chance of speshing, I suspect

[08:15] <TimToady> and inlining

[08:15] <TimToady> mostly, the GLR is trying to get rid of asking the same question over and over

[08:16] <TimToady> or from a different angle, hoisting the negotiation out of the datastream, and making .gimme and .reify go away

[08:16] <timotimo> that does sound quite good.

[08:18] <FROGGS> ohh, getting rid of .gimme and .reify sounds very nice, these were quite expensive in the few profiles I've seen

[08:18] <TimToady> and basically trying to get the OO overhead out of data streaming

[08:19] <TimToady> figuring out where we can cheat on immutable iterators is also a big part of it

[08:20] <TimToady> but that takes src/dest knowledge, again

[09:35] <moritz> laben: what do you mean by "test"? Run the unit tests?

[09:35] <moritz> t/basic.t .. Default constructor for 'Query' only takes named arguments

[09:35] *** TuxCM joined
[09:35] <laben> morits: yep, that's it

[09:36] <timotimo> that doesn't seem like something that'd be a regression from changes in rakudo

[09:36] <laben> moritz: i too get that, but i was warrying since tony-o said he didn't get that error

[09:36] <moritz> laben: I just did a very fresh rakudo build, bootstrapped panda, and got that error too

[09:36] <moritz> laben: so not just you

[09:36] <laben> timotimo: i don't think it's recent, much more probably it's a change in syntax or semantic some time ago

[09:37] <timotimo> mhm

[09:37] <timotimo> we do have a smoker now, but we're not watching the results closely enough ...

[09:37] <laben> i was just trying to understand why did it give that error in particular and how to fix it

[09:37] <laben> but i still cannot make it out

[09:38] <timotimo> someone was XML::Query.new(1, 2, 3)

[09:38] <timotimo> but it should have been XML::Query.new(:foo(1), :bar(2), :baz(3))

[09:39] <laben> i tried changing the method new in Query.pm6 but to no avail

[09:40] <timotimo> oh, it has a new method already?

[09:40] <timotimo> something ends up calling "right past" that constructor

[09:41] <laben> timotimo: yes and it's strange since it's basically new ($args) { self.new(:$args)} which doesn't make much sense to me

[09:41] <timotimo> is that a multi method new?

[09:41] <laben> i changed that to new ($args) {self.bless(...)}

[09:42] <laben> timotimo: yes

[09:42] <timotimo> in that case, it must be ignoring that particular candidate

[09:42] <timotimo> try putting a "say" in front

[09:42] <timotimo> i suspect that say wouldn't get triggered

[09:42] <laben> in front of what?

[09:43] <timotimo> at the very beginning of the method new you changed

[09:43] *** Hor|zon joined
[09:43] <timotimo> brrt: do the jit ops "usecapture" and "savecapture" as well as "capturehasnameds" and "captureposelems" seem tricky to jit? or are they due for a rewrite when the args passing changes happen?

[09:44] <brrt> lemmesee

[09:44] <timotimo> interestingly, my heavily NativeCall using program here only bails 3x on nativecallinvoke

[09:44] <timotimo> perhaps that means many of the postcircumfix:<( )> are inlined into a big frame that happen to abort earlier due to whatever

[09:45] <brrt> usecapture is easy, savecapture can be functified

[09:46] <timotimo> do we have a jit argument shorthand constant thingie for "pass the current capture here" for our "emit c function call" thingie? 

[09:46] <brrt> .. no

[09:46] <timotimo> do we need one?

[09:47] <brrt> not that i can tell

[09:48] <timotimo> cool

[09:49] <timotimo> a tiny something for the hackathon, then :)

[09:49] <timotimo> hm, also a few bails on getobjsc, that should be jittable easily

[09:49] <timotimo> just look into the header, where the pointer to the sc is stored, right?

[09:49] <laben> timotimo: there is something strange going on there

[09:50] <timotimo> or use MVM_sc_get_obj_sc as a C function

[09:50] <timotimo> ah, needs to be that C function, as it may want to demand the object to be deserialized first

[09:51] <timotimo> i'm not sure we can just say "at spesh time, that code has been run often enough that that doesn't matter any more!"

[09:51] <brrt> i'll go get lunch now :-)

[09:51] <timotimo> good lunch!

[09:51] *** vike left
[09:52] <laben> timotimo: without modifying anything, the result changes if i use the compiled version in blib/lib or the textual version in lib

[09:52] <laben> like this, "env PERL6LIB=lib perl6 t/basic.t" works, but "env PERL6LIB=blib/lib perl6 t/basic.t" doesn't

[10:31] <timotimo> i'm going to APW!

[10:32] <FROGGS> and you are with awesome ppl in a car

[10:32] <timotimo> aye

[10:32] <timotimo> it kind of sounded like there'd be another person besides me in that car with liz and woolfy

[10:32] <timotimo> is that right?

[10:32] <FROGGS> leont, aye

[10:32] <timotimo> cool

[10:33] <FROGGS> yepp

[10:33] <FROGGS> ohh damn...

[10:33] <FROGGS> I wanted to take a book with me so that TimToady could sign it :/

[10:34] <timotimo> i don't have any perl-related books :S

[10:34] <FROGGS> GET OUTTA HERE! *g*

[10:36] <FROGGS> I have one or two books, but just skimmed them

[10:36] <timotimo> perhaps at some point i could write a perl-related book :P

[10:36] <FROGGS> do you think you could be/are a good writer?

[10:37] <FROGGS> I know that I'm not

[10:37] <timotimo> i don't think i could :\

[10:38] <FROGGS> well, I'm not sad about it... I know where my strengths are... and where my strengths are not that well distributed

[10:39] <FROGGS> so I try to do the things I can do :o)

[10:39] <FROGGS> these are usually the things that are fun anyway

[10:40] <FROGGS> though, I enjoyed writing the stubs for the story of my game... but that was more about writing down thoughts instead of writing a proper story

[10:41] <FROGGS> what do I do for the next four hours train? I should probably read about ::, :::, cut and commit

[10:43] <FROGGS> ewww, or I don't

[10:43] <timotimo> what's ewww about that? :(

[10:43] <FROGGS> "Evaluating a triple colon throws away all saved choice points since

[10:43] <FROGGS> the current regex was entered.  Backtracking to (or past) this point

[10:43] <FROGGS> will fail the rule outright (no matter where in the regex it occurs)"

[10:44] <FROGGS> like this throw away thing... how do I do that?

[10:44] <timotimo> empty the backtrack stack of all the cursors or something ... no clue :\

[10:44] <timotimo> oh, "since the current regex was entered"

[10:44] <timotimo> that makes it more doable

[10:45] <FROGGS> so ::: is commit?

[10:45] <FROGGS> ahh, kinda

[10:50] <FROGGS> <cut> might be the one that is the easiest of that bunch

[10:58] <FROGGS> the hook that will be called when the grammar likes to have more input :o)

[10:59] <FROGGS> like, you write a few lines in a repl and it will trigger at the final }

[10:59] <FROGGS> (or so)

[10:59] <FROGGS> so we would eval when that happens, and not per line as we do

[11:02] <timotimo> ah

[11:02] <FROGGS> err, s/moreinfo/moreinput/, sorry

[11:02] <timotimo> well, i tried to port that and it turned out to not work, but that was long long ago

[13:05] <lichtkind> but my favorite dj's dont have it in their names :)

[13:05] <FROGGS> scumdog1: because Nil was meant to vanish in lists

[14:19] <azawawi> How do i read and write to an external process in Perl 6?

[14:21] <lichtkind> azawawi: last rant , i hope for the day than we have full runtime introspection int whol semantics of anyl language through perl 6 this will be a new class of editors

[14:22] <azawawi> true

[14:25] *** treehug88 joined
[14:26] <PerlJam> azawawi: Proc::Async maybe?   That's where I'd start anyway.

[14:27] <PerlJam> (I'm fairly sure there are unimplemented bits, though)

[14:29] <carlin> this is what I did with the magic that FROGGS++ showed earlier: https://github.com/carbin/stomp/commit/830378cc56b742a13bc1ced2986c7ec48f3a1455

[14:33] <moritz> you have file names that contain double colons?

[14:33] <moritz> that won't work on windows, iirc

[14:35] <FROGGS> why not?

[14:35] <FROGGS> ahh

[14:35] <FROGGS> wait

[14:35] <moritz> that's a file name, not a module name, right?
