[00:44] *** thou left
[00:48] <japhb> OK, now I need some actual stress tests ...

[00:50] <timotimo> please be more specific in defining "stress"?

[00:51] <japhb> timotimo: A test that will fail to run at some scale level (not just timeout -- I'm talking segfault, signal, wrong output, that sort of thing)

[00:52] <timotimo> oh, hmm

[00:52] <japhb> My first thought is perhaps any flappy tests we have in roast, because those would at least get wrong output sometimes.

[00:52] <timotimo> mhm mhm

[00:53] <timotimo> i'm not 100% sure i can think of anything new off the top of my head

[00:53] <japhb> Well, is there a list of said flappy tests?

[00:55] <timotimo> S17-procasync/print.rakudo.moar

[00:56] <timotimo> at least

[00:56] <timotimo> i don't know what the exact flappers are

[00:56] <japhb> OK

[01:00] <timotimo> does this set of features also give regular benchmarks more interesting data/results/analysis?

[01:08] <japhb> timotimo: Yes, timeall is now always collecting failure information, and can diagnose several different forms of failure (including output mismatch, if an expected output is defined for a test)

[01:09] <japhb> And analyze can now (at least in text mode) show the failure profile of each test as it scales

[01:10] <japhb> But I need some tests that actually fail to make sure I'm doing everything right.  :-)

[01:11] * japhb is considering the value of having roast as a component, and teaching timeall to be able to run a set of tests from there.

[01:12] <japhb> I need a simplified harness that can parse TAP output just well enough to determine if all tests were run and OK.

[11:03] <lizmat> that feels incorrect as well, as I've done 1 push after the release

[11:10] <FROGGS> or other test scripts

[11:11] <psch> uncommitted/added diffs get preserved in the repo clean is run in, and -xdf doesn't descent into other repos

[13:23] <psch> i'm still not 100% sure if i'm handling options with optional values well

[13:25] <psch> as it is in the PR i'm only taking a optional value for those options when there's an equals sign

[13:26] <psch> otherwise, the option simply doesn't get a value, even if there's something that could be the value, which might result in a broken invocation

[13:26] <psch> e.g. «perl6 --doc Pod::To::HTML $somefile» would complain with 'File not found Pod::To::HTML'

[13:28] <psch> i can't assume that the next token is always an option, because then «perl6 --stagestats $file» never runs the file

[15:05] <masak> I just got bitten by "passed a named param to a .new method, program compiled, error (much later) at runtime"

[15:05] <masak> again.

[15:05] <masak> I think we could detect this one statically. and I think there's a case for it being core, and on by default.

[15:05] <masak> at least a warning.

[15:07] <masak> I would be 100% fine with the analysis being extremely stupid -- i.e. only cover the cases where the class is known at author time, and where we know for 100% sure that no attribute can possibly be there.

[15:07] <masak> the above is such a case.

[16:23] <timotimo> if you're looking for "when will we call the specification 6.0.0", there's three really big items that need resolving:

[16:23] <timotimo> the GLR, NSA and NFG

[16:23] <timotimo> which are the Great List Refactor (unifying and de-special-casing and also speedifying lists and iterators)

[16:24] <timotimo> Native Shaped Arrays, which gives us tightly packed arrays of native values like ints/chars/doubles/...

[16:24] <timotimo> and Normalized Form Grapheme, which is a way to get a string to have a single codepoint per grapheme no matter what crazy diacritics your troll users throw at you

[17:03] <timotimo> that is some pretty unidiomatic perl6 code

[17:03] <tadzik> FROGGS: yt?

[17:04] <psch> timotimo: seems like a as-close-as-possible translation of the corresponding p5 code

[17:05] <timotimo> it's not very close, i don't think

[17:05] <timotimo> for example, in perl5 the names are constants, in perl6 they are variables

[17:06] <masak> s/variables/first-class package objects/

[17:07] <timotimo> i just went ahead and invited him to our irc channel

[17:08] * timotimo afk for a bit :P

[17:08] <psch> :D

[17:13] <moritz> after GLR,   my $c = <a b c>; $c.push: 'd'  will work, right?

[17:18] <timotimo> i'm pretty sure it should

[17:18] <TimToady> a stronger case can be made for .plan than for .push

[17:19] <timotimo> i'll run the benchmark through the profiler and see what's what

[17:20] <TimToady> doubtless there are some optimizations that could depend on knowing whether a particular list can be extended

[17:21] <dalek> roast/glr: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/de481bfc4f

[17:22] <TimToady> so maybe we need a monadoid to manage that

[17:22] <psch> fwiw, 100 iterations of smart-match and flipflop code above with Bool mixin clocks in at about .79 seconds on my machine.  nom is at about .38

[17:23] <psch> i.e. "True but $seqnum" flipflop is about half as fast as current flipflop

[17:24] <psch> although i'm sure it could be solved smarter than i solved it, but i don't know if i can make up a smarter solution

[17:24] <timotimo> psch: since these values usually start at 0, maybe we can have a cache that keeps the boxed and mixed-in objects around and then just clones them each time?

[17:25] <psch> timotimo: they start at 1 for flip flop, but i'd say "yes we can"

[17:25] <psch> maybe i can figure that out, probably not this weekend though

[17:25] <moritz> TimToady: I thought about more .map and .for methods; if we have both, I'd be weird to have 'for' as a syntactic construct but 'map' as a sub

[17:25] *** thou joined
[17:26] <moritz> so for @list {block}, but map {block}, @list

[17:26] <moritz> TimToady: any plans on makiing 'map @list {block}' work too?

[17:27] <TimToady> I think that hobgoblin lives off in a corner, and can be probably be ignored :)

[17:27] <psch> oh, also of note: i'm not running jitted, which might make a difference with the 500 prefix:<++> that my little benchmark here runs

[17:27] <psch> ...actually 300

[17:28] <TimToady> as for statement control map, it would be too ambiguous with the function

[17:28] <timotimo> ah, hm.

[17:29] <TimToady> are you mixing the number in each time?  that sounds heavy

[17:30] <timotimo> doesn't each mixin action cause Moar's specializer to go "okay, global deoptimization time!"

[17:30] <TimToady> maybe we should look for bit that we can set in success/failure values that smartmatch can check very quickly

[17:31] * TimToady refrains from calling it the OKness bit

[17:31] <TimToady> but something on the level of .DEFINITE

[17:32] * TimToady would like jnthn++'s opinion on that

[17:33] <TimToady> we don't have to call it .OKness, feel free to bikeshed what a "successfulness" bit would be named

[17:33] <psch> yeah, my implementation is as naive as it can get

[17:33] <timotimo> let's call it the "good bit"

[17:33] <timotimo> (like the "evil bit" that we have in networking)

[17:33] <TimToady> well, but what if it's bad this time?

[17:34] <timotimo> hmm

[17:34] <timotimo> maybe we should call it something without an inherent value

[17:34] <timotimo> like a "duck bit"

[17:35] <TimToady> but it wants to express meta-value

[17:35] <psch> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/src/Perl6/Actions.nqp#L5333 i'm just wrapping this Op.new in another one that amounts to $state.Bool but $state

[17:35] <moritz> any objections to me introducing method for as  self.flat.map?

[17:35] <moritz> that way code can start to use it, and have a chance to break less during GLR

[17:35] <TimToady> seems okay to me

[17:36] <timotimo> there you're using that "okay" word again!

[17:37] <moritz> m: say ((1, 2), (3, 4)).map({ say .perl; $_ })

[17:41] <tadzik> in that benchmark?

[17:42] <tadzik> funny things is, it bails out with a wrong sum at the second run

[17:42] <timotimo> yeah, it does 10k iterations and expects the result to be the same as for 100k iterations

[17:49] *** FROGGS_ joined
[17:53] <TimToady> or maybe we should just make it easier to generate fake Match objects with numeric values

[17:53] *** FROGGS left
[17:54] <TimToady> not sure that would beat True but $seqnum though

[17:55] <TimToady> it would fit into the current I-know-success-when-I-see-it scheme though

[17:55] *** Mso150 joined
[17:56] <TimToady> would be kinda funny to have a Match object that + return 3 for, but @ return nothing

[17:56] <psch> fwiw, i've been thinking of True but $seqnum as a name for the semantics

[17:57] <TimToady> maybe there's some way to optimize creation of Bool plus a payload

[17:58] <TimToady> after all, Failure can be seen as kind of a Nil plus a payload

[17:58] <TimToady> that's why I'm thinking leave Bool alone and muck with Match instead

[17:59] <timotimo> COMPUTED [100000] ITERATIONS IN [87] SECONDS

[17:59] <timotimo> waitwhat.

[17:59] <timotimo> what did i do?

[17:59] <timotimo> oh

[18:00] <TimToady> ohoh

[18:00] <timotimo> i replaced the custom sum implementation with [+] @args

[18:00] <timotimo> http://t.h8.lv/p6profile/formula_profile_2.html

[18:00] <timotimo> not sure if that's all that's responsible, though

[18:02] <TimToady> [+] is one of those operators that could actually be parallelized internally, given a suitable data structure

[18:03] <timotimo> hm.

[18:03] <TimToady> likewise [*], though in either case one could get weirdness near the Rat->Num promotion

[18:03] <timotimo> mhm

[18:05] <TimToady> probably compiling those down to very tight jitted code is more useful in general

[18:07] <timotimo> how exactly do we [+]?

[18:08] <timotimo> that's reduce_left, right?

[18:08] <masak> [+] and [*] could be map-reduced, because of their monoidal structure.

[18:09] <timotimo> yeah, they could

[18:09] <TimToady> well, it's METAOP_REDUCE_LEFT actually

[18:10] <TimToady> but in general you can trap it at compile time since the ops are lexically scoped

[18:10] <timotimo> right

[18:10] <timotimo> the optimizer could know about that or we could have a trait for these operators that lend themselves to be map-reduced

[18:11] *** kaare_ left
[18:11] <TimToady> well, METAOP_REDUCE_LEFT is actually called at compile time, iiuc

[18:12] <TimToady> or at least it could be

[18:12] <timotimo> m: say "the custom sum operation makes the program take { 339 / 87 } times longer than with [+]"

[18:12] <camelia> rakudo-moar 315ec6: OUTPUT«the custom sum operation makes the program take 3.896552 times longer than with [+]␤»

[18:13] <TimToady> is the custom sum routine done in natives?

[18:13] <timotimo> maybe all we need to do for that to work is put an "is pure" trait on those

[18:13] <timotimo> i don't think so

[18:13] <TimToady> well, not that [+] is either

[18:14] <masak> the operator needs to be associative.

[18:16] <timotimo> ah, also: the code there is working with rational numbers instead of ints and stuff

[18:16] <timotimo> that may also have strong performance implications

[18:17] <TimToady> we've specced 'native' rats, but we don't have 'em yet

[20:58] <lizmat> some fixing is in order, it would seem

[21:10] <lizmat> colomon: seems only  t/spec/S32-io/dir.t fails

[21:11] <colomon> lizmat: fails with what?

[21:11] <lizmat> d0a1b098 (Solomon Foster 2013-06-03 20:18:44 -0400 14) ok @files.grep(*.basename

[21:11] <timotimo> of course jitting multicachefind only gets us to invokewithcapture which doesn't do it any more

[21:11] <lizmat> it expected an IO::Path object there

[21:11] <lizmat> test #3

[21:12] <lizmat> but I'm surprised it doesn't break anything else

[21:13] <lizmat> hmmm... it also breaks Panda

[21:13] <lizmat> but I could fix that at the same time

[21:18] <lizmat> but not now, as I'm tired and need the extra hour this night

[21:18] <lizmat> so good night, #perl6!

[21:30] <raydiak> it's interesting as this algebra module progresses how much of it ends up resembling a compiler...it parses, emits, uses a tree for the working structure, has an "optimizer" for simplifying expressions, etc...

[21:31] <masak> all software wants to be either an interpreter or a compiler.

[21:31] <psch> and an email client ;)

[21:32] <raydiak> wow I never quite thought about it like that...but that makes sense

[21:32] * psch .oO( that's still interpreting... )

[21:33] <masak> psch: think of how much software out there that's mainly a switch statement in a loop. that's an interpreter.

[21:33] <masak> psch: compilers arise as you add layers of caching to an interpreter.

[21:35] <psch> masak: i was jesting, in reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski.27s_law_of_software_envelopment

[21:36] <psch> masak: i do agree with your point.

[21:36] <masak> oh, sorry, I meant those last two lines for raydiak :)

[21:36] <masak> psch: I almost replied to you "an email client is still an interpreter", but then you pre-empted me :)

[21:38] <raydiak> that's a really interesting way of thinking about it

[21:38] <psch> masak++ # thinking

[21:39] <raydiak> I remember thinking about Pray as a "compiler" for scene files -> image files, in a conversation I was having about futamura projections

[21:39] <raydiak> masak++ # ensuring I get my paradigm shift for the day

[21:46] <masak> I have the feeling SICP the book gets its oomph quite a bit from that insight. and maybe Lisp in general does, too.

[21:49] <timotimo> http://t.h8.lv/p6profile/jit_bails_per_frame_name.txt

[21:52] <raydiak> thanks, I'll put that book on my list of books...lisp is already on my list of languages to learn :)

[21:54] <masak> it can be found legally for free online, and nowadays in a variety of nice formats: http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/ebook/

[21:55] <raydiak> oh awesome

[22:18] <colomon> SICP is one of the books I'd love to tackle if I mysteriously got another five hours in each day....

[22:19] <colomon> Unforutunately I have a good stack of such books at this point.  :(

[22:19] <masak> I'm trying to rope colleagues into tackling SICP with me, by meeting up regularly and talking about it.

[22:19] <masak> a bit like a reading circle, but with code.

[22:19] <colomon> that's a fine idea

[22:20] <masak> but yeah, there's definitely an element of "in my copious spare time" involved.

[22:26] <raydiak> speaking of things that consume time...any suggestions for a linux distro to put on an old craptop for my g/f?  was thinking lubuntu but I haven't ridden the distro merry-go-round for a few years

[22:28] <masak> raydiak: you might want to have a look at http://linuxmint.com/ -- very no-nonsense, easy install, and doesn't have Unity.

[22:29] <raydiak> yeah I'm running mint kde on my own laptop, it works pretty great

[22:30] <raydiak> guess light resource usage is one of my top concerns for the 2007 low-end laptop I'm putting this on

[22:31] <raydiak> lucky for me we fell off moore's law, or the thing would be darn near useless :)

[22:36] <psch> i'm off to bed.  good night, #perl6 \o

[22:36] <masak> 'n, psch

[22:36] <raydiak> good night psch o/

[22:36] <colomon> \o                                                                                                            

[22:39] <raydiak> heh it appears I changed the passwords on the thing due to the keyboard keys that don't work

[22:52] <raiph> I'm curious if P6 is on the static typing side of the fence in regard to leonerd's answer to the question heard in last 2 minutes of the yapc eu video of his futures module https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9dZgFM6FtE&list=UU7PuZDAIVMyE7mgkZHunXGw#t=48m22s

[22:53] <raiph> I see lizmat in the audience so perhaps she has an answer already?

[23:59] <raiph> .ask perl6 to encourage someone to post a P6 version of the tiny reverse polish forthish "compiler" at http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/2kb0c7/a_compiler_written_in_perl/ (I plan to have a go early next week if no one else gets to it and it's still in the top 10 on /r/perl)

[23:59] <yoleaux> raiph: I'll pass your message to perl6.
