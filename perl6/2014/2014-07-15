[09:06] <Ven> .lines doesn't take windows's \r into account, and I've had to remove them myself several times. Should it take care of that ?

[09:06] <moritz> yes

[09:06] <moritz> though the exact mode how that should happen isn't clear to me

[09:07] <moritz> maybe \cr\lf should become one grapheme that matches \n

[09:08] <Ven> that does raise a ETOOMAGICAL for me

[09:11] *** virtualsue joined
[09:31] <Ven> Type check failed for return value; expected 'Bool' but got 'Junction' <- looks like new rakudo broke my game of life :(

[09:32] <moritz> seems like you shouldn't return a Junction when you declared that you return a bool :-)

[09:32] <moritz> maybe 'return so $expression_with_junction'

[09:33] <Ven> I don't return a Junction, though.

[09:33] <Ven> 0 <= $y <= $.dim && 0 <= $x <= $.dim && @.grid[$y][$x] // False; <- how can this return a function ? Except if @.grid ... contains one.

[09:33] <moritz> Ven: just assign it to a variable, and say it's .^name

[09:33] <moritz> then you know.

[09:33] <Ven> m: my $a = do given 3 { when 3 { 1 == 1 | 2 }  }; say $a.perl

[09:33] <camelia> rakudo-moar 736027: OUTPUT«any(Bool::True, Bool::False)␤»

[09:33] <Ven> WAT.

[09:34] <Ven> m: my $a = so do given 3 { when 3 { 1 == 1 | 2 }  }; say $a.perl

[09:34] <camelia> rakudo-moar 736027: OUTPUT«Bool::True␤»

[09:34] * moritz doesn't find it WAT

[09:34] <moritz> you write a Junction, it returns a Junction.

[09:34] <moritz> if you don't want a junction, use || instead of |

[09:35] <moritz> or so, yes

[09:35] <Ven> no, I write `1 == 1 | 2`, not `1 | 2`. But eh.

[09:37] <jnthn> Operations involving a Junction produce a Junction, which flattens away in a boolean context.

[09:37] <betterworld> m: my $a = do given 3 { when 3 { 1 == 1 | 2 }  }; say ?$a.perl

[09:37] <camelia> rakudo-moar 736027: OUTPUT«True␤»

[09:37] <Ven> Yeah, but apparently it used to automatically flatten or something.

[09:39] *** thou joined
[09:40] <Ven> if I do `my Bool @array`, should it auto flatten ?

[09:40] *** kaleem joined
[09:41] <jnthn> No.

[09:43] <moritz> that's a type check declaration, not a type coercion declaration

[11:39] <hoelzro> morning #perl6

[11:44] <hoelzro> I'm having an issue with my work on S26; my #= comment token seems to be matched *twice* by Grammar.pm, and I can't figure out why

[11:44] <hoelzro> here's a patch, script, and sample output file: https://gist.github.com/hoelzro/6f356615290a55802f0e

[11:52] <zengargoyle> junctions are starting to remind me of Monads, once you put something in one, you stuck with it forever...

[11:55] *** carlin joined
[12:00] <cognominal> zengargoyle, unlike monads junctions have a very specific purpose. And for monads, idris addresses the issue ias explained in http://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/drafts/eff-tutorial.pdf  Not sure it can tricklle down to haskell though.

[12:15] <hoelzro> here's my crappy workaround for that: https://github.com/hoelzro/rakudo/commit/64af795ef74b9ff05f4e24c27bac76de24ef27c3

[12:47] <arnsholt> Oh sorry, SILE

[12:47] <arnsholt> Always interested in new LaTeX stuff =)

[12:47] <[Coke]> https://github.com/simoncozens/sile

[12:48] <[Coke]> "SILE is a text formatting engine. It's sort of like TeX, except it isn't 35 years old, doesn't use idiosyncratic font and output formats, and it isn't written in Pascal."

[12:48] *** jnap left
[12:49] <arnsholt> Sounds interesting, but that'd also have the drawback of not having all of my fun TeX stuff =)

[12:49] <arnsholt> One of the reasons TeX is so darn resilient is that it's actually a complete programming language

[12:51] <carlin> .oO( Perl 6 is a programmig language. It's sort of like Perl 5, except it isn't 20 years old... )

[12:51] <[Coke]> given that simon had the first commit in the parrot repo, that should not surprise you. :)

[12:52] <[Coke]> I looked at it briefly, but it seems almost like html2pdf to me, based on how I'd use it.

[13:03] *** atroxaper joined
[13:03] <lizmat> Question: should we ever allow loading of a pre-compiled compunit if the associated source file is not there (anymore) ?

[13:04] <lizmat> if we consider the pre-comp file to be a cache, to be refreshed when needed, a pre-comp binary file only makes that impossible

[13:05] <lizmat> on the other hand, in the case of a .jar: there may not be a source file available for rakudo to use to create the pre-comp binary

[13:06] <jnthn> Note that pre-comp binaries are tied to a particular Rakudo build also.

[13:06] <FROGGS_> not having the ability to rebuild a .moarvm file does not imply disallowing to use that .moarvm file when it is still valid

[13:06] *** atroxaper left
[13:06] *** atroxaper joined
[13:06] <jnthn> Folks certainly may wish to distribute a binary build, but I think they use case is going to be shipping a complete package including a matching Rakudo.

[13:06] <jnthn> *the

[13:07] <FROGGS_> true

[13:07] <jnthn> Which is fine, really; disk is cheap.

[13:07] *** treehug88 left
[13:13] <lizmat> so binary only is ok?

[13:13] <lizmat> in the context of a complete package and source obfuscation, I guess  :-)

[13:14] <FROGGS_> yes

[13:14] <timotimo> source obfuscation is a brilliant idea!

[13:14] <FROGGS_> also, the source could be somewhere else at runtime... so as long the cache is okay we should use it

[13:14] <timotimo> we should ship a tool that strips annotations like line numbers out of moarvm bytecode %)

[13:14] <jnthn> lizmat: Perhaps "binary is OK" depends on the compunitrepo in question.

[13:15] <jnthn> lizmat: But to a first approximation, I'd say allow it.

[13:15] <lizmat> okidoki..  just checking  :-)

[13:40] <hoelzro> FROGGS_: extra points if you can help me think of a better solution than my existing one =)

[13:40] * hoelzro isn't sure if you can tell if a token was matched via lookahead or otherwise

[13:40] <hoelzro> hmmm...do action methods get called for lookaheads?

[13:41] <FROGGS_> no

[13:41] <FROGGS_> action methods are called for every matching token

[13:41] <hoelzro> ah ha

[13:41] <timotimo> is there a way to capture the result of a lookahead anyway?

[13:41] <hoelzro> so maybe I should be doing my work there...

[13:41] <FROGGS_> timotimo: no

[13:42] <FROGGS_> timotimo: maybe in an ugly way...

[13:42] <FROGGS_> hoelzro: yeah, that is what actions are for, basically :o)

[13:42] <timotimo> heh. put a { $external_var = $/.clone } in there or something

[14:59] <masak> I don't think it's obsolete as in "there's no concievable use for it".

[15:00] <masak> hm, getting a deprecation warning...

[15:00] <hoelzro> I haven't been keeping up with the module ecosystem stuff in P6 land much, so I'm wondering if there's something newer, flashier, and better available =)

[16:03] <hoelzro> so I just discovered that http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/documenting-perl-6/ uses #= as leading comments

[16:03] <hoelzro> should that be corrected?

[16:03] <hoelzro> are advent posts edited after the fact if the language changes in ways that invalidate them?

[16:05] <flussence> I think it's okay, as long as you leave a footnote saying it was changed

[16:05] <masak> yes, sometimes they are edited.

[16:05] <masak> depends on the original author, I think.

[16:10] <japhb> hoelzro: What's the cycle for #= deprecation?  I end up using it a lot ...

[16:10] <hoelzro> japhb: I have no idea =P

[16:10] <hoelzro> I've just been working to make rakudo follow the spec

[16:10] <hoelzro> the fix is pretty simple; just replace #= with #|

[16:11] <japhb> In nom, or another branch?

[16:11] <hoelzro> it's in S26-WHY under github.com/hoelzro/rakudo

[16:11] *** rurban1 joined
[16:11] <hoelzro> it *could* be in this month's release

[16:11] <japhb> Yeah, just a lot of stuff to update, a fair amount of it shared -- so I have to make sure I update the code and users' perl6 at the same time.

[16:12] <hoelzro> but I might hold off having it merged until 2014.08

[16:12] <hoelzro> if you look at roast, there's a file called S26-TODO under the S26-WHY branch

[16:12] <japhb> If you decide to hold off, I would put a deprecation warning in 2014.07's changelog

[16:12] <hoelzro> which illustrates how much is left to be done =)

[16:12] <hoelzro> sounds like a good idea to me

[16:13] <hoelzro> my program that makes use of this stuff won't be ready until after 2014.08 is out anyway

[16:13] <hoelzro> who's the release manager this month, anyway?

[16:15] <japhb> Hmmm, I don't see one in docs/release_guide.pod

[16:19] <PerlJam> "#= deprecation"?  What's that about?

[16:19] *** kaleem left
[16:19] *** fhelmberger left
[16:20] <masak> it's an old spec change from October 2011.

[16:21] <PerlJam> So, #= isn't going away, just its meaning changes?

[16:21] <masak> https://github.com/perl6/specs/commit/7d19390d0260bca59a2c0ba6d54968cc39206bd6

[16:21] <masak> it's being split in two, favoring predictability rather than DWIM.

[16:22] <masak> I bet there is quite a bit of interesting discussion in the IRC logs around that time, too.

[16:22] <masak> I remember Haddock (a similar Haskell doc tool/syntax) being discussed as an influence.

[16:22] *** grondilu joined
[16:23] <PerlJam> Aye, I've been thinking of it as that commit says, but when I saw "#= deprecation", it sounded like it was going away.

[16:23] <grondilu> Hello, maybe the following warning while compiling MoarVM is worth signaling:

[16:23] <grondilu> src/6model/reprs/CPointer.c: In function ‘set_int’:

[16:23] <grondilu> src/6model/reprs/CPointer.c:33:17: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast] body->ptr = (void *)value; 

[16:24] <grondilu> (it's the only warning I get so I thought maybe it matters=

[16:24] <hoelzro> PerlJam: I guess it's more of an "existing behavior of #=" deprecation =)

[16:24] <jnthn> grondilu: On 32-bit, ooc?

[16:25] *** SamuraiJack_ left
[16:26] *** atroxaper joined
[16:26] <grondilu> there's a similar warning in exceptions.c:

[17:48] <sergot> It's seems to be easy when we talk about files, but not so easy in case of sockets.

[17:48] <sergot> it seems*

[17:50] <FROGGS_> can't we establish an unsecured connection via openssl, and upgrade it afterwards?

[17:50] <FROGGS_> this way we would have an fd for sure

[18:08] *** Vlavv left

[18:23] <japhb> jnthn: I think his point was that with < (as opposed to <<), the inner spaces *disappeared*.

[18:23] <japhb> If the spaces were still there but the splitting hadn't happened, that would be a different issue.

[18:33] <jnthn> japhb: That's what I meant by it being a post-processing step with <...>. We parse it like any other string, and then split it afterwards. It's <<...>> that works at a smarter, AST level.

[18:35] <jnthn> raiph: It was more a concern with {...} really: if you were commenting out lines of code using #, and just happen to comment out a line starting with a {, it's preferable that it doesn't suddenly change meaning from being a single-line to a bracketed comment.

[18:35] <jnthn> ` isn't used in code in Perl 6, so it's not a risk with that.

[18:56] <PerlJam> japhb++ for saying what I was thinking

[18:56] <cognominal> vendethiel, people do stats about activities on well know places and conclude that Perl is dead.  But most perl activity is secluded on  perl.org irc  servers.

[18:56] <masak> Rakudo compiler release is in two days, and we don't have a release manager signed up :(

[18:57] <PerlJam> The only problem with using IRC as a communication medium for work is that sometimes ... you actually have to do some work  ;)

[18:59] * jnthn wonders why it's become so hard to find release managers :(

[19:00] <masak> I could sign up for it, but I'd prefer to delegate it.

[19:00] <cognominal> vendethiel surely, people who relies on whatever metrics fails to see interesting things because Kuhnian paradigm changes make old metrics obsolete.

[19:01] <PerlJam> jnthn: people are busy?

[19:02] <jnthn> PerlJam: Maybe the average busy-ness of channel inhabitants has increased in recent months... :)

[19:02] <masak> I agree -- it used to be easier.

[19:14] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/38ec697819

[19:14] <masak> note: I will do it if no-one else does. but I'd prefer it if someone else did.

[19:14] <masak> ooh!

[19:14] <masak> FROGGS++

[19:15] <masak> FROGGS_: can I grab September, then?

[19:15] <FROGGS_> in exchange jnthn++ needs to fix the jvm stuff :P

[19:15] <FROGGS_> masak: sure, if you like

[19:15] <FROGGS_> in fact, I don't mind doing both

[19:15] <dalek> rakudo/nom: [docs/release_guide] oust FROGGS++ from Septembe

[19:15] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4a3e4d9102

[19:15] <lizmat> masak, FROGGS_: July is impossible for me because I'll be on a plane to Portland and zonked out on the far end

[19:15] <masak> r

[19:15] *** hovercraft left
[19:16] <masak> lizmat: "zonked out on the far end" sounds like a good name for an ambient rock band.

[19:17] <[Coke]> masak, FROGGS_: happy to take sept instead of august, no problem.

[19:17] *** kivutar left
[19:17] <masak> either works for me.

[19:17] <[Coke]> (or later, if needs be. it was just teh first one I knew I'd be able to do when I signed up)

[19:18] <masak> I'm just happy we now have releasers for all the way to October :>

[19:18] <jnthn> lizmat: Feel free to pick Nov or Dec. ;)

[19:18] *** rindolf left
[19:18] <jnthn> At this rate we can be done for the rest of the year. :)

[19:18] <masak> \o/

[19:18] <masak> #perl6++

[19:18] <FROGGS_> well, there is also star

[19:18] <jnthn> Yes...

[19:19] <FROGGS_> btw, it might make sense to do both star and the compiler release in the same run

[19:19] <PerlJam> FROGGS_: have you done them both like that before?

[19:19] <jnthn> I'm not sure that'll help...given Star can involve chasing modules up...

[19:19] <FROGGS_> ewww, I've got a 48cm thingeny on my pillow that stinks >.<

[19:19] *** [Sno] left
[19:20] <masak> "thingeny"?

[19:20] <FROGGS_> PerlJam: I always do a last star smoke test when doing a compiler release, so I see that there is no point release needed to recover from a regression

[19:20] <[Coke]> PerlJam: the 2014-10 release is on the 23, not the 16th.

[19:20] <[Coke]> mind if I fix it?

[19:20] <FROGGS_> masak: yeah, I mean it is cute when it sleeps, but it does not smell nice atm

[19:21] <PerlJam> sure, I just left the date that was there.

[19:21] <[Coke]> it's "first thursday after 3rd tuesday", not "third thursday", which has bit me at least once in the past.

[19:21] *** thistuso- left
[19:22] <PerlJam> FROGGS_: I haven't looked, but if you have any pointers about compiler release + star release, it might be useful to add that to the release guide.

[19:22] <FROGGS_> PerlJam: the star release has its own guide

[19:33] <[Coke]> huh. ok.

[19:33] <FROGGS_> moar is (was?) hard because of S17

[21:35] <avuserow> how hard is making a star release? I may have some tuits and interest in that this month. If not to do it entirely, to lend a hand somehow if that's possible?

[21:36] <[Coke]> IME, it's more time intensive than hard.

[21:36] <avuserow> I've been thinking recently when lurking that I ought to take a release sometime but my timezone does not align with the channel's peak activity very well
