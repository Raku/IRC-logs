[00:00] <masak> lue: I'm inclined to agree.

[00:00] <masak> grammar inheritance notwithstanding.

[00:00] <masak> extending rather than modifying will always be the "safe" strategy.

[00:01] <lue> The only time you'd really want to change an existing grammar is to add a feature to it, e.g. to hook into a new slang, and macros could accomplish that perhaps.

[00:01] *** tgt left
[00:02] <masak> lue: I can see people maybe getting away with adding a twigil, or something similar.

[00:02] <masak> but perhaps protoregexes will make that feasible.

[00:02] *** dmol left
[00:05] *** treehug88 left
[00:05] * lue still thinks the syntax inside the braces of  slang { }  needs to be something that pulls together grammar, actions, and other possible related things, instead of precisely the same things as go in  grammar { }

[00:06] *** tgt joined
[00:08] *** fridim__ left
[00:08] <lue> Still a lot of thinking that needs to be done on slangs, just thought I'd let you know what I see slangs useful for nowadays :) .

[00:10] <masak> lue: thanks.

[00:10] <masak> I agree we're not quite there yet.

[00:10] *** tgt left
[00:10] <masak> as usual in these situations, I think things will only start to happen once the rubber meets the road -- once someone tries something, and gets feedback from users and from seeing it work in practice.

[00:11] <lue> I'm not surprised it's not even well-spec'd, let alone implemented; who'd be insane enough to allow the user to change the language they're writing in? ;)

[00:11] <masak> aka "rough consensus and working code"

[00:12] <lue> I think there's still some work to do to get something that can be implemented in the first place, but certainly most of the ironing out will be in usage, not speculation :)

[00:12] *** spider-mario left
[00:15] <masak> agree that we must be fairly certain what we want, and we aren't yet :)

[00:16] <masak> sometimes I wish I could associate an actions class with a grammar, slang or no.

[00:17] <masak> it's very rare that I do something other than 1-grammar-1-actions-class.

[00:17] <Mouq> "chr codepoint cannot be negative" :?

[00:17] <lue> masak: what, isn't :actions enough an association for you? :P

[00:18] <lue> Mouq: check for an E<> somewhere near where the backtrace tells you in the offending Pod6 file.

[00:18] <masak> lue: no, because that association has to be done per-parse-call. I'd like to be able to make the association once, from the grammar.

[00:19] <Mouq> lue: Re-ran, came up with same bug

[00:19] <lue> masak: one of my ideas is that slang could perhaps be a general grammar/action associator, with the special language-level bit being stuffing that slang-thing in a $~THING and using that variable somewhere in the Perl6 grammar/actions/etc.

[00:20] * Mouq tries https://gist.github.com/Mouq/82ebe2

[00:20] <masak> lue: mhm.

[00:20] * Mouq realizes how much that diff will annoy lue

[00:20] <lue> Mouq: https://gist.github.com/Mouq/82ebe2 is a 404 :/

[00:20] <skids> masak: just overload .parse.

[00:20] <Mouq> lue: https://gist.github.com/Mouq/82ebe2b9633c487d3795

[00:22] <lue> I still like my way for how it follows the POD generator's output. :)

[00:22] <lue> Also, my way uses high-number PUA Unicode chars, so there :P

[00:23] *** fridim__ joined
[00:24] <Mouq> lue: :) your way definitely wins on coolness (and probably actually-working-ness)

[00:25] <lue> Perhaps I can stick the HTML I want in one giant V<> at some point :) [Unless Pod::To::HTML tries to escape the angle brackets and such...]

[00:27] * Mouq realizes the problem is probably something as simple as spaces around the <p>

[00:27] <lue> (fwiw, I originally wanted to use the C0 and/or C1 control chars (because they look so disused, at least in the stuff I find myself doing), but none of them have the precisely right meanings ‚ò∫ (closest is SOH/STX/ETX) )

[05:22] *** [Sno] left
[05:23] <TimToady> hopefully we can now start playing with uniprops in nom, and do things like return the Rat corresponding to the vulgar fractions

[05:31] <lue> TimToady: currently S15 has a uniprops function that returns a hash of all the properties a given character. I'm wondering if replacing that with a uniprop($char, $prop) type thing would be better.

[05:32] <lue> (would have the advantage that the name &uniprops can be for the function that gives you a property for every character, akin to ord/ords and chr/chrs. If the hash is still needed, perhaps &unihash or something)

[05:33] <dalek> rakudo/nom: b4336af | larry++ | tools/build/NQP_REVISION:

[05:33] <dalek> rakudo/nom: oops, need to bump the nqp that bumps moar

[05:33] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/b4336af9d9

[05:43] <TimToady> there is no point in returning all the properties; any given program would only be interested in a few properties

[05:44] <TimToady> the tendency is to look at the same set of props for a lot of character rather than a lot of props for a single char

[05:45] <TimToady> I think uniprop(Int $codepoint, Str $propname) should probably be the basic function, and it should cache whatever it needs to access that particular property for other chars too

[05:46] <TimToady> I'm thinking that it should return an Int, a Str, or a Rat depending on the nature of the property

[05:46] <TimToady> alternately, we can split into functions that return each type

[05:46] <japhb__> TimToady: re: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-03-04#i_8379668 , the format of these is (most recent tag in commit path)-(revs since the tag)-g(7 leading digits of SHA-1 for this commit)

[05:46] <japhb__> (Optionally with -dirty on the end, if you've asked for it, and your working directory is not fully committed)

[05:46] <TimToady> hmm

[05:47] <lue> TimToady: yeah, I'm realizing now "return all the properties" provides no benefits, and only detriments. I'm wondering if uniprop($chr, *@props) would be better or part of a multi.

[05:47] <TimToady> we can have a multi uniprop that takes a string instead of a codepoint, but the basic interface is integer based

[05:48] <lue> I can go for that.

[05:48] <TimToady> so we should provide access to the integer API for when that's the natural input

[05:48] <lue> TimToady: the hash-based function as specced has this to say about its values: "Values for properties may be C<Bool> for binary ("Yes"/"No") values, a C<Rat>

[05:48] <lue> for numeric values, and C<Str> objects for all other types of values."

[05:49] <lue> .oO(The *one* place where polymorphic (return) types would be cool to have, though not necessary.)

[05:49] <TimToady> well, a lot of them are Int rather than Rat

[05:49] <lue> Yeah, I just went with Rat to reduce the number of possible types :)

[05:49] <TimToady> but adding in Bool is...possible..

[05:49] <TimToady> but we don't know which ones are bools in the current API

[05:50] <TimToady> well, I think it should .narrow :)

[05:51] <lue> TimToady: this is what I used to discern possible return types: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-12.html#About_Property_Table

[05:51] <lue> C,E,S,M --> Str, N --> Rat (etc.), B --> Bool

[05:53] <lue> (The Enumeration values could theoretically be enums, but that would be pushing it I feel.)

[05:54] *** renormalist joined
[05:54] <TimToady> except to calculate N, you need to be numerator and denominator, which are coming out as string enums right now, because of how moar compresses enumerations and things like them

[05:55] <lue> could the returns be subjected to val() processing perhaps?

[05:55] <lue> the N values that is

[05:55] <TimToady> well, we'll construct the right type somehow

[19:09] <FROGGS> [Coke]: but it matters when we abort a test file on moar, where jvm skips a single test and continues

[19:09] <[Coke]> ah, yes, abort is worse than simple failure.

[19:09] <FROGGS> but I'd like to see these tests fixed instead of skipped of course :o)

[19:09] <[Coke]> this new testing box seems much slower.

[19:25] <masak> FROGGS: don't know what broke it, or when.

[19:26] <FROGGS> masak: years ago I suppose?

[19:26] <FROGGS> star: my $c = 0; macro donner { quasi { ++$c } }; say donner; say donner; say $c

[19:28] <masak> FROGGS: a year ago, I'd say.

[19:28] <FROGGS> k

[19:28] <masak> but I may be wrong on this.

[19:28] <FROGGS> that is a starting point :o)

[19:30] <timotimo> so, if i had a gui system, or something that uses callbacks a lot

[19:30] <timotimo> python would allow you to write things like "callback=self.the_shiny_callback"

[19:31] <segomos> masak: that method foo { method bar { } } thing is throwing me off

[19:31] <timotimo> in perl6 we'd have to write something more like callback => { self.the_shiny_callback; }, don't we?

[19:31] <FROGGS> timotimo: can't you pass it around using an & sigil?

[19:31] <masak> FROGGS: yes, I'm wrong. there's an open ticket for this: https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120928 -- linked from that post.

[19:32] <masak> segomos: why?

[19:32] <FROGGS> masak: thanks!

[19:32] <masak> segomos: (genuinely curious)

[19:33] <timotimo> FROGGS: not methods

[19:33] <timotimo> the trick with python is that when you write self.the_shiny_callback, you get a "bound method" back

[19:33] <timotimo> which is kind of like a closure in disguise

[19:34] <segomos> masak: it just looks like doing C.bar should be a syntax error, i know that it isn't, i'm just drawn to it

[19:34] <timotimo> to be exact, it's a closure that closes over exactly "self" and delegates any arguments you give to it to the method on that method invoked on that closed-over self

[19:34] *** virtualsue joined
[19:34] <timotimo> i was about to complain, that p6's way is more wordy, but it's actually much clearer what's going on

[19:35] *** __thou left
[19:36] <masak> segomos: you can declare a method inside a class. that is all. :)

[19:38] <masak> timotimo: Python's way of doing it is definitely a local minimum. it has "user simplicity" going for it. Perl 6's way is more "honest".

[19:40] <timotimo> i think the increased amount of "honesty" makes perl‚ÄØ6 a kind of nicer language to be taught to complete beginners

[19:40] <timotimo> but i'd have to try that to verify it.

[19:41] <FROGGS> masak: that is an awesome post!

[19:42] <FROGGS> but I think "outselves" is a typo :o)

[20:02] <masak> we were surprised too, first time we discovered it.

[20:02] <FROGGS> a method declaration just looks up the out class, and installs itself in there

[20:03] <masak> but really, it falls out of how classes and method declarations work.

[20:03] <vendethiel> well, I really don't think it should even allow that. What sense does it make ?

[20:05] <vendethiel> masak: no, far from that. But really, at first, I thought the code exampled messed up its  { and }

[20:05] <masak> vendethiel: you write a module that refuses to parse it. everyone wins.

[20:05] <vendethiel> masak: would people be okay about that ?

[20:07] <masak> vendethiel: my point is, we don't go around forbidding things just because we can't see the use. we're not Python devs.

[20:07] <vendethiel> masak: if you predeclare that methods can't be nested ?

[20:21] <moritz> off-topic question: is there a way to configure less to act like cat if the input is small enough to fit into one screen?

[20:21] <FROGGS> [Coke]: it is a sub

[20:21] <timotimo> i like that.

[20:21] <[Coke]> I see that now ,yes. :)

[20:21] <moritz> there's less -F, but that just exits, it doesn't cat the file

[20:22] <masak> moritz: Git behaves like that, but I don't know how it does it.

[20:22] <masak> moritz: ...maybe ask on #git ? :)

[20:22] <geekosaur> for less there's an option

[20:22] *** pippo joined
[20:22] <geekosaur> (of course, there's only a billion of them)

[20:23] <[Coke]> -F looks like it's supposed to work...

[20:23] <timotimo> isn't -E right?

[20:23] <timotimo> hm. well, almost.

[20:23] <jercos> -E will die when the bottom is hit, -F looks more appropriate

[20:23] <moritz> oh, I meant -E, not -F

[20:24] <timotimo> oh?

[20:24] <timotimo> ah!

[20:24] <timotimo> it exits and clears the screen

[20:24] <timotimo> that's annoying

[20:24] <moritz> neither -E nor -F produce any output for me if the input is short

[20:24] <geekosaur> odd

[20:25] *** Mouq joined
[20:25] <[Coke]> mmm. I've seen this working, I think there's another option to go along with -F...

[20:25] <jercos> $ echo foo | less -F

[20:25] * jercos shrugs

[20:25] <moritz> oh

[20:25] <moritz> less -XF

[20:26] <geekosaur> might see if -L makes it work for you

[20:26] <geekosaur> oh, yes, the deinit clears screen thing

[20:26] <moritz> ok, thanks everybody, timotimo++ jercos++ geekosaur++ [Coke]++ masak++

[20:26] <timotimo> yeah, -X

[20:26] <timotimo> i just stumbled upon that

[20:26] <geekosaur> which is more likely not clears screen but switches to/from alternate screen, which is something I often disable in the terminal

[20:27] <geekosaur> because it's obnoxious

[20:27] <timotimo> aye, the alternate screen is an interesting concept

[20:28] <timotimo> it has the whole DWIM + WAT thing going on

[20:29] <FROGGS> DO WAT I MEAN

[20:29] <moritz> FROGGS++

[20:29] <timotimo> :D

[20:29] *** Mouq left
[20:29] <moritz> oh, now I understand why nothing remains in the terminal after less has terminated

[20:30] <lue> Ah, is the alternate screen the thing where I exit out of vi or whatever and I get to see all the previous terminal output there?

[20:30] <geekosaur> yep

[20:31] <geekosaur> it has its place, sadly there is no way to specify which programs use it

[20:31] <lue> It's weird how so many things I found searching for "alternate screen" tell you how to get rid of it. I get annoyed when I have to use the bare linux console and it doesn't do that.

[20:32] <geekosaur> depending on the terminal description (termcap/terminfo stuff) in use, it may activate on all programs that use cursor addressing or programs that use insert/delete commands

[20:40] <[Coke]> that test is suspect and I think we should fix it or kill it.
