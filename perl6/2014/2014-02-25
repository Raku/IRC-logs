[01:27] <lue> .u U+10176B

[01:27] <yoleaux> No characters found

[01:27] <lostguy> can someone help me with my perl 6 problem im trying to use the rakudo make file but it says  no rule to make target j-all D: help?

[01:28] <TimToady> did you configure with the jvm backend?

[01:29] <TimToady> perl Configure.pl --backends=ALL --gen-nqp --gen-parrot --gen-moar

[01:29] <TimToady> that's what I use

[01:29] <TimToady> but then it makes all three bakends

[01:30] <lostguy> what is j-all from?

[01:31] <TimToady> j-all would just be a rule in the Makefile that says to make everything for the jvm backend.  no j-all is actually created

[01:31] <TimToady> but it sounds like your Makefile is borked

[01:31] <TimToady> did you just say "make"

[01:32] <TimToady> to invoke it?

[01:32] <lostguy> yea

[01:32] <TimToady> are you using HEAD from github?

[01:32] <lostguy> pretty sure4

[01:32] <TimToady> are you trying to make all the backends?

[01:33] <TimToady> what did you use for a Configure command?

[01:33] *** denis_boyun__ left
[01:34] <lostguy> i think it might be a problem at the end of setting up the backends it tries to nmake but there isnt a nmake command

[01:34] <TimToady> hmm, I'm not a windows guy

[01:35] <lostguy> i pretty do it the linux way :P command prompt

[01:35] <TimToady> are you on Linux?

[01:36] <TimToady> well, we certainly have people making it on windows, including jnthn++

[01:36] <lostguy> i think i gotta add more PATH variables :P

[01:37] <TimToady> could be, but if you're using the same path Configure did, it oughta figure things out

[01:37] <lostguy> its trying to run nmake which is visual studio

[01:37] <TimToady> maybe Configure is stupid about some o fthe semantic corners

[01:37] <TimToady> you can probably get a gmake from somewhere

[01:38] <TimToady> but yeah, maybe pathness is the issue

[01:38] <lostguy> i have a make

[01:38] <lostguy> i have cgywin pathed with gnu make

[01:38] *** treehug88 left
[01:38] <TimToady> is your cygwin somehow changing the path on you?

[01:39] <TimToady> I don't think anyone here is actually building under cygwin

[01:39] <TimToady> if that's what you're attempting

[01:39] <TimToady> are you using a cygwin shell?

[06:36] <FROGGS_> .tell lostguy I'd recommend installing MSVC Express and rip out gmake/cygwin stuff if you can, this should work out. (perhaps use ActivePerl instead of strawberry also)

[06:36] <yoleaux> FROGGS_: I'll pass your message to lostguy.

[06:36] <FROGGS_> I already wanted to ask hoelzro if he can golf it down some more

[08:47] <TimToady> but I think the cross and zip metaops are doing some weird error trapping somewhere

[08:47] <TimToady> I'd get fatal errors thrown with some of my mistakes, and they'd give a traceback and then continue to the next iteration somehow

[10:17] <timotimo> didn't look deeply into it, but ...

[10:18] <nwc10> oh. bother. valgrind is usually correct

[10:18] <timotimo> oh, the 32bit address confusion thing was about memcpy wanting bytes, rather than "number of things to copy"

[10:18] <timotimo> so i had to multiply by 4 in the right places

[10:18] <timotimo> but not on others, where adding to a pointer will increment by 4 bytes by virtue of the pointer being an int32 pointer

[16:03] <TimToady> it isn't like P5 :)

[16:03] <smls> seem much more sane to me, than in Perl 5

[16:04] <TimToady> but P6 is very consistent on the subject of postfixes, so the middle parens cannot be a postfix

[16:04] <TimToady> and the reason for the postfix policy is language extensibility

[16:05] <TimToady> and leads to the general best practice of putting spaces around infixes

[16:05] <TimToady> you can write 1*2, but then what if someone adds a postfix:<*> operator?

[16:09] <ashleydev> is ',' an infix?

[16:09] <TimToady> yes

[16:09] <ashleydev> but doesn't get surrounded with spaces?

[16:09] <TimToady> and, in fact, Z is now defined (as of yesterday) as Z,

[16:10] <TimToady> nobody in their right mind is going to write postfix:<,> :)

[16:10] <ashleydev> go on finish your sentence

[16:10] <TimToady> :P

[16:11] <TimToady> so while you can write "1 , 2", I don't expect that one to become a best practice

[16:11] <PerlJam> s/think/thing/

[16:12] <TimToady> and it may be that best practice will settle on 1*2 rather than admitting a possible postfix:<*>, but that's really kinda up to the community to vote

[16:12] <TimToady> PerlJam: you right mind is really on your left :)

[16:12] <smls> glad that the P5 function call ambiguity is gone

[16:13] <smls> print "     Hello";             # original code

[16:13] <PerlJam> smls: amen!

[16:13] <smls> print (" " x $indent)."Hello";  # adding a little feature... looks harmless enough, right?

[16:13] <smls> --> BUG

[16:13] <benabik> circumfix:<*> so you can *$emphasize* things?

[16:13] *** denisboyun left
[16:13] <TimToady> would have to be circumfix:<* *>

[16:13] <benabik> D'oh

[16:14] <TimToady> but note the collision with term:<*>

[16:14] <ashleydev> so infix w/o space is ambiguous only when there's a postfix of the same name?

[16:14] <TimToady> yes

[16:15] <benabik> Hm.  Circumfix and prefix have to worry about collisions with term.

[16:15] <TimToady> and most infixes are more readable with spaces anyway

[16:15] <TimToady> yes, we only really have three syntactic slots there

[16:15] <TimToady> term, postfix, and infix

[16:15] <TimToady> prefix and circumfix are in with term

[16:16] <benabik> prefixes are just terms that expect another expression as postfix?

[16:16] <TimToady> and we can't really afford to parse differently based on whether there's a closer

[16:16] *** SamuraiJack__ left
[16:16] <TimToady> benabik: I wouldn't say it that way, since that's outside the technical meaning of "postfix" in P6 culture, but yeah

[16:17] <TimToady> prefixes just recursivel expect another term, until you really find a term

[16:17] <TimToady> *ly

[16:18] <TimToady> much like regex assertions have internal prefixes like <?foo> that just reparse as if you'd written <foo>

[16:19] <TimToady> people can figure out much smarter parsers that can decipher all sorts of tangled language, but such parsers force the user to be as smart as the parser

[16:20] <TimToady> so we opt for a few ironclad rules instead

[16:20] <TimToady> one-pass, self-clocking terms, no ws before postfix

[16:20] <TimToady> very limited backtracking

[16:22] <TimToady> P6 only backtracks in two spots, that I recall

[16:22] <TimToady> distinguishing [+] from [1]

[16:23] <TimToady> and finding the final brackets in interpolating a string like "$foo.bar().baz"

[16:23] <ashleydev> what's [1] for?

[16:23] <TimToady> it's an array with a 1 in it

[16:23] <TimToady> both of those occur in term position

[16:24] <TimToady> but reduction operators are pretty easy to recognize

[16:24] <TimToady> first, they don't allow space, so [ 1 ] is always an array

[16:24] <TimToady> second, the namespace of infix operators is pretty easy to recognize, and fairly distinct from array literals

[16:25] <kurahaupo_mobile> TimToady: so [+] is matched by the parser rather than the lexer?

[16:25] <TimToady> yes, in fact

[16:25] <TimToady> since the lexer is limited to DFA semantics, the recursive nature of metaops would explode a lexer that tried to do the whole thing

[16:26] <TimToady> believe me, I tried

[16:26] <TimToady> so the LTM is really just [

[16:26] <TimToady> and then it backtracks if it can't get an infix followed by a ]

[16:27] <TimToady> it's one of those massive DWIMs that almost never triggers a WAT

[16:27] *** Ven left
[16:27] <TimToady> because visually reduce ops are so distinct from array literals

[16:29] <TimToady> in P6 we try to avoid most of the low-luminosity dwims from P5, and instead choose a few high-luminosity dwims

[16:29] *** [Sno] left
[16:29] <TimToady> reduce ops is one, so is smartmatching

[16:30] <kurahaupo_mobile> so really its own little layer between the lexer & parser?

[16:30] <PerlJam> TimToady: woolfy & lizmat need to get you some wooden coins with DWIM on one side and WAT on the other :)

[16:30] *** salv0 left
[16:31] <kurahaupo_mobile> how does the parsing of meta ops interact with the precedence of the constructed op and its effect on the outer parser?

[16:31] <TimToady> well, that's what I was mentioning earlier as a deficiency in rakudo

[16:32] * kurahaupo_mobile has been away too long and doesn't recognize "WAT" 

[16:32] <TimToady> which fakes some things in the compiler that should really be done with higher-order functions, but we can't until the functions carry their own associativity properties

[17:43] <timotimo> wow, holy crap

[17:43] <timotimo> the performance is rc-forest-fire tanked *massively* since the release

[17:44] <PerlJam> timotimo: the dips on the _concat graphs are because of string handling inefficiences I take it?

[17:44] <jnthn> timotimo: All the for looping things have gotten slower too

[17:44] <jnthn> timotimo: I suspect your tests are not on the same Rakudo revision...

[17:45] <jnthn> But yeah, we should figure out what hurt forrest fire so badly.

[17:45] <jnthn> That can't just be "for got a bit slower"

[17:45] <jnthn> 'cus it's a huge change rather than a minor one.

[17:49] <TimToady> well, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a laziness vs reify issue

[17:49] <TimToady> having removed the faulty batching logic from mapiter, it falls to other reifys to decide batching policies

[17:50] <TimToady> and doubtless some of those could use more context to decide right

[17:50] <TimToady> range's reify was easy because it has no side effects

[19:04] <TimToady> yes, I'm hoping the slowdown is not related to correctness, but merely de-fastpathing

[22:11] <lue> Hm, I kinda feel like writing a thing for the docs about parameters (introducing you to gradually more complex things with them); should I improve "Signature Literals" in the signature doc, make a separate doc, or pull out the "Signature Literals" section and improve that?

[22:11] * Mouq fixed it!

[22:30] <TimToady> spectesting a fix for [] bug in bare X and Z now

[22:32] <TimToady> also, **@lol is useless, have to use |lol instead

[22:49] <lue> What the \foo type of variable called again? "sigilless" ?

[22:49] *** Rotwang left
[22:50] <TimToady> that's one name for 'em

[22:50] *** xinming left
[22:50] <TimToady> or it's a parcel binding

[22:50] <TimToady> my \foo = is a form of SSA

[22:51] <TimToady> insofar as it allows only one alias

[22:51] <jnthn> That's the thing r-j tends to give when the evalserver fails

[22:51] <TimToady> so "alias" is another term for it

[22:54] <ashleydev> SSA?

[22:54] <ashleydev> (it's not in the glossary)

[22:55] <lue> "Static single assignment", I believe.

[23:10] <jnthn> TimToady: Instead of:

[23:10] <jnthn> if lol[0].VAR.WHAT === Scalar {

[23:10] <jnthn> You may want

[23:10] <jnthn> if nqp::iscont(lol[0]) {

[23:10] <jnthn> This has the benefit of being a bunch faster, but also will cope with the case where we have, say, a Proxy.

[23:11] <jnthn> Or a mixed-in-to Scalar.

[23:11] *** tgt left
[23:13] <TimToady> as I was saying, I wish we could build some of this into .flat or **@lol

[23:13] <TimToady> so I don't have to plate the boiler all over

[23:14] *** berekuk left
[23:14] <TimToady> as it is, **@lol is relatively useless

[23:14] <jnthn> Then it probably wants to change somehow :)

[23:14] <TimToady> but I can try your boilerplate instead :)

[23:15] <TimToady> (for now)

[23:15] <TimToady> thanks
