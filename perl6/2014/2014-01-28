[00:00] <jercos> raydiak: the difference is that it's explicit? :p

[00:01] <raydiak> jercos: according to the discussion earlier today in the backlog, the difference is massive, performance-wise

[00:02] <jercos> Ah, I did scroll up for context, but not all the way to 12 hours ago.

[00:04] <raydiak> I'm a little behind :)

[00:17] <moritz> raydiak: a return basically throws a control exception that a routine catches

[00:18] <moritz> raydiak: so you can do fun stuff like catching that control exception

[00:18] <moritz> raydiak: the compiler should really optimize that away if it can proof that there's no catcher, but it's not yet smart enough

[00:20] <raydiak> thanks moritz++, that's extremely useful for me to know

[03:02] <raydiak> japhb: I decided to leave the organization alone for now, and added a couple operations instead, incl cross product...are right-handed coordinates okay? or did you want to provide some facility for choosing handedness?

[04:12] <diakopter> usage of the world perl through the years: http://goo.gl/rrwyv4

[04:18] <diakopter> usage of other programming language names through the years: http://goo.gl/cbnPKM

[04:21] <BenGoldberg> Set smoothing to zero to see a graph using the real data

[04:22] <diakopter> law of small numbers... :)

[04:25] <BenGoldberg> Also, since that data is how many times those words occur in all books in the corpus, not *just* programming books, I'm sure many occasions of the word 'java' refer to the island (or the coffee), and many occasions of the word 'ruby' refer to the gemstone. 

[04:26] <diakopter> well maybe. but the general hype/noise hump there I think is pretty representative of the programming self-help segment

[04:26] *** xenoterracide joined
[04:27] <perigrin> BenGoldberg: you'd expect Python to see a bump for the snake though 

[04:28] <BenGoldberg> That too :)

[04:58] <diakopter> skids: yeah, I think those curves can be normalized to all programming languages interest

[05:00] <diakopter> [I think]

[05:00] *** btyler_ left
[05:01] <skids> Yes it seems that there is less interest in programming due probably to recession and/or dotcom afterglow fading.

[05:02] *** BenGoldberg left
[05:03] <lue> If that thing just searches books, it's possible that books aren't the place to write about programming languages anymore :)

[05:04] <skids> Maybe google isn't the place to search anymore either and people are just turning to social media forums.

[05:05] <skids> (perfectly horrible way to find information, but that doesn't stop behavioral trends.)

[05:07] <perigrin> might be people aren't the right things to search for programming languages

[05:07] <perigrin> and applications are all generated by other AI

[05:09] <skids> And Professional Services Organizations are just a AI population growth mechanism?

[05:10] <perigrin> YAPC is going to be renamed YABC - Yet Another Bot Conference

[05:13] <japhb> raydiak: I'd say "like OpenGL does it".  That means a right handed coordinate system, and transformation matrices specified and multiplied as they are in the OpenGL docs.

[08:40] <brrt> … shame

[08:40] <brrt> i'm superexcited to go

[08:40] <tadzik> anyway, I think it's doing better than ever

[08:40] <tadzik> MoarVM is better and better

[09:25] <hoelzro> brrt: I'll be there

[09:25] <tadzik> first they ignore you, then they laugh at you...

[09:26] <hoelzro> timotimo: not only that, but I managed to build the docs *without* the OOM killer knocking on my door!

[09:27] <brrt> tadzik: then they continue ignoring you

[09:27] <Ulti> someone in my lab who mainly uses Python is going to learn Perl just to completely replace his use of BASH, which is both a good idea and a new person to Perl, but he's never going to blog about his hacked up research shell like scripts :/

[09:27] <timotimo> hoelzro: \o/ \o/ \o/

[09:28] <timotimo> hoelzro: what timing, ooc?

[09:28] <hoelzro> timotimo: 7m

[09:28] <timotimo> that's not even bad

[09:28] <hoelzro> nope

[09:28] <timotimo> but still not very good :P

[09:28] <hoelzro> and I got it to run using 600MB RAM

[09:29] <timotimo> we should be able to do better, but it's a good start.

[09:29] <hoelzro> it's a *great* start

[10:25] <arnsholt> Have fun =)

[10:26] <arnsholt> PDF is more of an image format than a text format, so there's lots of weird stuff that can happen

[10:26] <timotimo> yes.

[16:01] <rindolf> Well, I tried copy+pasting the code, but it wanted to eval every line separately.

[16:01] <diakopter> o_O

[16:02] <colomon> rindolf: interactively, like a REPL?

[16:02] <timotimo> rindolf: yeah, that's a problem with rakudo as well

[16:02] <rindolf> colomon: I mean I have some source code in a file I want to load it and execute some commands.

[16:02] <timotimo> maybe we should introduce an explicit "line continuation character"

[16:03] <jnthn> eval slurp 'file'

[16:03] <rindolf> colomon: in order to test it.

[16:03] <jnthn> Or if it's implemented, evalfile 'file'

[16:03] <colomon> use filename doesn't work from the REPL?

[16:03] <timotimo> as in "if this line ends in that character and without it, it'd not parse on its own, then strip the character, assk for another line and concatenate. then repeat"

[16:03] <timotimo> actually, \ at the end of a line followed by a literal newline may even work without having to strip it

[16:03] <jnthn> Oh, I misread

[16:04] <jnthn> Yeah, use works in repl too :)

[16:04] <jnthn> But not with filename.

[16:04] <jnthn> And yeah, it won't import the subs.

[16:04] <rindolf> Undeclared routine:

[16:04] <rindolf>         'eval' used at line 1

[16:04] <timotimo> EVAL? :)

[16:06] <timotimo> on some of our backends, the repl of rakudo is very ... weird

[16:06] <colomon> use module name works fine in Niecza.

[16:06] <colomon> in the REPL, I mean.

[16:06] <rindolf> colomon: what's the exact incantation?

[16:06] <colomon> niecza> use ABC::Utils

[16:06] <colomon> Nil

[16:06] <colomon> niecza> is-a-power-of-two(1/4)

[16:06] <colomon> True

[16:07] *** btyler left
[16:07] <colomon> the module has to be in the library search path, I actually ran Niecza from ABC's lib directory so I could import ABC modules.

[16:07] <rindolf> colomon: OK.

[16:07] <rindolf> colomon: how does the module look like?

[16:07] <PerlJam> rindolf: are you perhaps having problems with the "have access to all of its subroutines" portion of your request?

[16:08] <rindolf> Does it end in .p6?

[16:08] <rindolf> PerlJam: yes, I do.

[16:08] <rindolf> Or .p6m?

[16:08] <colomon> .pm6, no?

[16:08] * colomon always just uses .pl and .pm

[16:08] * PerlJam just uses .pm

[16:08] <hoelzro> I think .pm is the winner these days

[16:10] <colomon> hoelzro: but wouldn't your github tools prefer .p6 / .pm6?   I've been pondering changing back....

[16:10] <hoelzro> colomon: they do, but I improved the detection over the weekend

[16:11] <hoelzro> everything roast, rakudo and rakudo-star/modules is successfully detected as Perl 6 (with two exceptions)

[16:11] <colomon> rindolf: anyway, if you're going to use your code as a module, you probably need "is export" on the subs.

[16:11] <hoelzro> it's sitting in a PR

[16:11] <rindolf> OK, how do I put packages in the .pm file?

[20:42] <psch> [Coke]: any hints/tips/tricks on how to find out if there's a ticket? or should i just rely on "there's no ticket number near the skip/todo" as a heuristic?

[20:44] * hugme hugs raydiak, good vi(m) user!

[20:44] <raydiak> ugh

[20:44] <raydiak> I have a really hard time keeping my windows straight lately

[20:45] <PerlJam> that's okay, curved windows are the future!

[20:46] <raydiak> that's it, I'm just ahead of the curve :)

[20:46] <psch> ahead of the pack, out of the straight into the curve

[20:47] * raydiak imagines a perl6 window manager with no straight lines and race cars running around the resize border...

[20:51] <psch> U+26D0, right

[20:52] <[Coke]> psch: you got it. "no rt near this comment means no rt". you can do a search to see if it's covered by a ticket, of course.

[20:52] <psch> [Coke]: right, thanks. i'm in S03-operators/precedence.t right now, for RT #116100

[20:52] <synopsebot> Link: https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116100

[20:52] <[Coke]> doesn't have to be mentioned IN the todo/skip message, but if there is one, it's usually right before it.

[21:26] <psch> did i forget to update something?

[21:26] <timotimo> in those cases, running Configure.pl again oftentimes helps

[21:26] <timotimo> you have to manually re-do it every time it changes

[21:26] <timotimo> and i think it recently did

[21:48] <[Coke]> timotimo: ayup

[21:48] <[Coke]> it was before then, IIRC.

[21:49] <timotimo> [Coke]: any news?

[21:49] <timotimo> (not that i have any interest in tcl itself, as i've never written a single line of code in it)

[21:52] <[Coke]> "i really hope I can find tuits to work on it again"

[21:52] <timotimo> fair enough :)

[21:52] <[Coke]> I had started moving it over to default to the jvm. Perhaps I will re-switch it to moar.

[21:53] <[Coke]> it's hard to stay motivated, I've had to rewrite that damn thing from scratch several times.

[21:53] <[Coke]> with much help from pmichaud++ the time before last!

[21:53] <[Coke]> "why, I remember when it was a p5 script that acted like a parrot assembler!"

[21:54] <[Coke]> timotimo: what made you think of it?

[21:54] <nwc10> um, isn't the point of NQP that you write it once and it runs on Parrot, JVM and Moar (and maybe JS at some point)? Or did you need custom ops?

[21:55] <timotimo> colomon: a person named "particle" joined this channel :)

[21:55] *** airdisa left
[21:56] *** treehug88 left
[21:56] <[Coke]> nwc10: there have been MANY nqps. :P

[21:57] <[Coke]> it was written for the original one bundled with parrot first.

[21:57] <nwc10> OK, that's at least 2 back

[21:57] <nwc10> but maybe I lost count

[21:57] <[Coke]> that was not a trivial upgrade. I never got a fully working version running on nqp-current.

[21:57] <nwc10> the *current* NQP which appears to be the final one

[21:57] <nwc10> aha.

[21:57] <timotimo> :D

[21:57] <[Coke]> nwc10: yes, I've been hacking on this since just after parrot started.

[21:57] <[Coke]> the pure-PIR version is the most complete.

[21:57] <timotimo> that sounds scary

[21:58] <PerlJam> [Coke]: does it still run on modern parrot?

[21:58] <[Coke]> I was running a substantial version of the tcl test suite with it.

[21:58] *** denis_boyun__ left
[21:59] <[Coke]> PerlJam: it was difficult to keep running against the moving target of parrot. Some stuff broke years ago and I couldn't get them fixed.

[21:59] <[Coke]> I don't know how much of it still works against parrot 5.

[21:59] <[Coke]> ... if I get it working against nqp-latest, then i won't care.

[21:59] <timotimo> isn't there parrot 6 now? :)

[22:00] <hoelzro> yes

[22:00] <hoelzro> just came out!
