[00:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 368750: OUTPUT¬´(timeout)¬ª

[00:01] <colomon> hmmm, locally that needs the end to be want-three-arg-function(&x); wants-three-arg-function(&wants-three-arg-function);

[00:01] <colomon> but then it works as desired.

[00:01] *** b2gills joined
[00:05] <timotimo> right, if you write just wants-three-arg-function, that's a call to wants-three-arg-function

[00:05] <timotimo> you need that to be &wants-three-arg-function

[00:34] <frew> so how do I say, "this function takes a coderef that takes two args and returns an int?"

[00:36] *** haroldwu left
[00:36] <timotimo> you would be able to write --> Int into the piece of the signature restricting thingie

[00:36] <timotimo> with the hacky workaround, you can also write (&f where &f.args == 2 and &f.returns eqv Int)

[00:37] <timotimo> eqv wouldn't allow int subtypes or roles applied to an Int, i believe

[00:38] <frew> huh

[00:40] <timotimo> explain your confusion?

[00:41] <frew> I'm not confused

[00:41] <timotimo> oh, ok

[00:41] <frew> I just think it needs sugar ;)

[00:41] <timotimo> yes, it does

[00:41] <timotimo> it's supposed to have sugar, too

[00:41] <frew> ah ok

[00:41] <frew> so if the sugar worked, what would it look like?

[00:42] <timotimo> sub very_picky_eater(&foo(Any, Any --> Int)) { ... }

[00:42] <frew> beautiful

[00:42] <timotimo> i'm not 100% sure about the syntax, though

[00:43] <frew> sure

[00:43] <timotimo> could be more like &foo[...] or &foo:(...)

[00:44] *** smls left
[00:46] <frew> timotimo: that where clause doesnt pares

[00:46] <frew> parse

[00:47] * frew tries &&

[00:47] <frew> yeah that fixes it

[00:48] <frew> looks like where clauses are not compile time

[00:49] <timotimo> that is true

[00:50] <frew> I suspect that it can be done somehow, since clearly arity can be verified at compile time

[00:50] <timotimo> well, that way lies madness :)

[00:51] <frew> how so?

[00:51] <timotimo> it's a rabbit hole that goes deeper than you might think

[00:51] <frew> what I mean is

[00:51] <timotimo> especially if you have things that do method calls

[00:51] <frew> the belief lies madness or persuing it does

[00:51] <timotimo> in theory i could subclass Routine or something and give it a truly nasty .arity for example :P

[00:52] <frew> all I want is to be able to statically validate coderefs and their arities basically

[00:52] *** Alina-malina left
[00:52] <frew> I'm ok with the answer being perl6 can't now

[00:52] <timotimo> the sugared way is totally going to be compile time

[00:52] <frew> but it's something I miss a lot

[00:52] <frew> right

[00:52] <frew> that's what I figured

[00:53] <timotimo> the non-sugared way ... much harder to pull off

[00:53] <frew> right, cause it's code

[00:53] *** Alina-malina joined
[00:53] <frew> and running code at compile time is a good way to never compile

[00:57] <timotimo> well, we do have BEGIN blocks, but there the programmer knows she's exposing herself to danger

[00:57] <frew> right

[00:57] <timotimo> also, we're not doing very deep type analysis yet; like, we hardly infer types when assignments or calls are done

[00:58] <frew> sur

[00:58] <timotimo> i don't think we ever use the specified return type of a subroutine to figure out if the value we get from it is an acceptable type to put into a variable or call something else with

[00:58] <timotimo> but that's something that we (or at least I) would like to have

[01:00] <timotimo> and the language specs surely allow for it

[07:07] <Tekk_> this being the MPD module

[07:07] <tadzik> unsure

[07:07] <tadzik> I'd look at how Perl 5 does it :)

[07:07] <Tekk_> fair enough

[07:08] <Tekk_> it's pretty usable now

[07:08] <Tekk_> has more stuff than the old one at least; you can actually control mpd :)

[07:09] <tadzik> cool :)

[07:13] <Tekk_> parsing is nasty atm though, just a bunch of regexes lined up

[07:13] <Tekk_> probably a much nicer way to do it

[08:28] <timotimo> uniqueloop: hi there

[08:28] <timotimo> uniqueloop: niecza has fallen behind with regards to features

[08:29] <timotimo> can you tell me where you read about niecza that made you think it'd be a better choice than rakudo for trying perl6? i'd like to rewrite whatever text that was

[08:29] *** PZt joined

[08:30] *** aristotle joined
[08:31] <tadzik> Tekk_: I think that grammars, apart from making complex things simplier, are also very useful for making simple things readable

[08:31] <tadzik> they seem scary at first, but I think they're well worth taming :)

[08:33] <aristotle> I want to concat a list with intermediate results, which would be  [\~]  -- except, I want to fold from the right instead of the left. but I can‚Äôt figure out any way to say something like  [\(infix:<~> but assoc<right>)]  -- is it just me, or is it Rakudo, or isn‚Äôt that doable in Perl 6 at all?

[08:35] <aristotle> also while I‚Äôm at that, but of separate interest -- is there a way to declare that infix:<~r> is infix:<~> except it‚Äôs assoc<right> other than spell it out fully as   sub infix:<~r> is assoc<right> { $^a ~ $^b }  ?

[08:35] <timotimo> hm, does the reduce operator actually understand right-associative operators?

[08:35] <aristotle> yes

[08:35] <timotimo> ah, neat

[08:36] <aristotle> if I do the latter and say [\~r], it works

[08:36] <timotimo> i think you can only use assoc and looser/tighter at the moment when you're declaring a new operator

[08:36] <timotimo> rather than with a but or does "after the fact"

[08:36] <uniqueloop> timotimo: ah, okay thank you.  That makes sense since it seems to have been a oneman initiative...

[08:36] <timotimo> not 100% sure if the specs would allow you to do it that other way

[08:36] <uniqueloop> timotimo, i just watched an old talk that Larry gave in Japan where he was using it instead  Rakudo because it gave better error messages

[08:36] <timotimo> uniqueloop: yeah, i'm sad it's abandoned

[08:37] <timotimo> rakudo's error messages have had a significant amount of improvement done to them, too :)

[08:37] <uniqueloop> and became interested in P6... have to say, niecza was easy to setup... git pull ; make and i was away to the races

[08:37] <aristotle> at this moment, but is it going to stay that way i.e. by design? (hence my ‚Äúis it just Rakudo‚Äù)

[08:38] <uniqueloop> i'll give rakudo a go now... thanks again

[08:38] <timotimo> right; in terms of necessary commands, rakudo is also easy to install, all you need is to git pull rakudo, perl Configure.pl --gen-moar and make, make install

[08:38] <timotimo> but it probably takes a bit longer than niecza

[08:38] <uniqueloop> timotimo: perfect, thanks for the pointer

[08:38] <timotimo> aristotle: that's what i tried to say with my poorly formulated sentence up there %)

[08:39] <aristotle> uniqueloop: I used rakudobrew last night to install Rakudo first time. it was very nearly as easy

[08:39] <timotimo> rakudobrew has the added benefit of being able to build panda for you as well

[08:43] <uniqueloop> aristotle: yeah, although I wouldn't have twigged onto it anyway.. because it was saying "this code now works in niecza"!

[11:27] <smls> thanks

[11:28] <abraxxa> smls: is the list inside list example correct? what does the $?

[11:29] <abraxxa> the legend says the violet border means item container

[11:29] <abraxxa> is this a pointer to a list?

[11:29] <smls> it puts the list in an item container

[11:30] <smls> same as calling the .item method on it

[11:30] <smls> although in current Rakudo those would be Parcels not List's, but I'm already thinking post-GLR... :)

[11:30] <abraxxa> what to in perl5 land does an item container compare too?

[11:30] <abraxxa> i've read taht Parcels (whatever they are) go away

[11:30] <abraxxa> the simpler the better

[11:31] <abraxxa> i remember i had a hard time to understand why a list element can't be a list/array itself but only a reference (pointer) to one

[11:31] *** chenryn left
[11:32] <smls> abraxxa: item containers are sort of like P5 references, but less explicit

[11:49] <smls> abraxxa: More important than preventing flattening, is that an item container's content can be replaced at any time, which is what makes it possible to do imperative programming in Perl 6 despite the fact that most of the basic types (Str, Int, ...) are immutable.

[11:50] <lizmat> smls: without looking at the nitty gritty of the presentation, I like it

[12:05] <lizmat> .oO( that's only so-so }

[12:05] <moritz> smls: the difficulty with generating such things is that you don't know the width of rendered text at the time you write the SVG

[12:06] <masak> that tends to be the one stumbling block when I generate SVG.

[12:06] <timotimo> smls: beautiful!

[12:06] <masak> it's possible to get around if you're willing to shell out to an SVG renderer, for example Inkscape.

[12:08] <raiph> imaginary-m: say 1, [2, 3] # does that currently flatten the 2,3? after the GLR?

[12:09] <moritz> no, and no

[12:09] * masak is of the opinion that it's a mistake to stringify arrays as we currently do in Perl 6

[12:10] <masak> for more on this, see https://github.com/masak/data-pretty

[12:10] <smls> moritz, masak: Is there no existing layout engine that can render to SVG and take care of calculating widths and applying margin/padding?

[12:10] <masak> smls: sure there is.

[12:11] <masak> smls: if you do it all in JavaScript in the browser, for example, all the information is available at runtime.

[12:11] <masak> the DOM nodes in the SVG have appropriate properties and methods.

[12:11] <lizmat> masak: so why don't we just import Data::Pretty into the settings ?

[12:12] <masak> lizmat: because (as far as I know) this remains my personal opinion, and not consensus.

[12:12] * moritz would be +1

[12:12] <masak> I'd particularly like explicit agreement from TimToady, who I'm sure has thought about the stringification of things once or twice.

[12:54] <Ven> :o to you too, tadzik 

[12:54] <colomon> Ven: it's okay, I'm fixing Compress::Zlib right now

[12:54] <Ven> colomon: I might very well have broken it, y'know

[12:54] <Ven> that'sprobably what happened...

[12:55] *** SamuraiJack left
[12:55] <colomon> as far as I can tell, it's Zlib that's wrong

[12:55] <colomon> it was doing is native('libz.so.1')

[12:55] <Ven> ah, maybe then :P

[12:56] <Ven> fair enough. I fixed it for supporting stuff like foo-1.2.3 (DOT NUMBER)

[12:56] <colomon> your patch (it was yours?) stopped recognizing .so.1 as a "use this exactly" extension

[12:56] <JimmyZ> well. on ubuntu ,it 's  all *.so.1

[12:56] <colomon> but I don't see why native('zlib') isn't used

[12:56] *** rurban left
[12:56] <colomon> and that works great on my Linux and OS X machines

[12:56] <JimmyZ> and no *.so

[12:57] <Ven> (I'm not more nami-doc on github,though!)

[12:57] <Ven> (FROGGS++)

[12:58] <colomon> it seems to me expressing the lib's full name instead of the short name is the wrong thing to do.  I mean, zlib.so.1 is never going to work on Windows, is it?

[12:58] <Ven> not even on osx

[12:58] <Ven> it's .dylib on osx

[12:59] <colomon> hmmm, yes

[16:49] <smls> TimToady, can you give me a quick primer on "read-only"-ness?

[16:49] <smls> In this case it looks like "read-only" is an attribute of a Scalar container:

[16:49] <smls>   my @a := $(1, 2), 3; say @a[0] = 10;

[16:50] <smls> In this case, it looks like it's a property of a variable, since both $x and $y refer to the same Scalar container (correct?) but only one of them is allowed to assign to it:

[16:50] <smls>   sub foo ($y) { $y++ }; my $x = 2; foo($x);

[16:50] <smls> Both examples die with "Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value" btw

[16:50] <smls> So do I understand it correctly that "read-only" exists both as a flag on Scalar objects, and as a flag on lexpad entries?

[16:50] <smls> Or am I thinking about it all wrong?

[16:52] <timotimo> try using .DUMP on things?

[16:53] *** ezra1 joined

[16:54] <jnthn> Uh, that I know of...

[16:54] * jnthn isn't all knowing :)

[16:54] <ezra1> maybe?

[16:54] *** camelia left
[16:55] <ezra1> me either :)

[16:55] <jnthn> smls: Typically the structure is lexpad -> Scalar -> value

[16:55] *** pyrimidine left
[16:56] <jnthn> A Scalar is something you can assign into if it's rw flag is set

[16:56] <jnthn> But another way to end up with readonlyness is

[16:56] <jnthn> lexpad -> value

[16:57] <jnthn> This is how it works in all cases really

[16:57] <ezra1> ok thats helpful

[16:57] <ezra1> if im successful ill put it up for others

[16:58] *** camelia joined
[16:58] <smls> jnthn: How about the case of subroutine paramter aliasing (2nd example I gave above)?

[16:58] <jnthn> ezra1: That'd be great. Also, while I forget exactly how it's done, there is a way to take a JVM class and get all the signatures you could possibly use 

[16:59] <smls> Doesn't the variable inside the routine refer to the same Scalar as the variable at the callsite?

[16:59] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v camelia

[16:59] <jnthn> smls: That either ends up being lexpad -> value or lexpad -> Scalar' -> value. We do the first when we can get away with it.

[16:59] *** dwarring joined
[16:59] <jnthn> No, you only get that if you write "is rw"

[17:00] *** camelia left
[17:00] <jnthn> Both of which retain the original thing so it can be assigned within the routine

[17:00] *** camelia joined
[17:01] <smls> So, a new Scalar (without "rw" set) is created when calling the function?

[17:01] <jnthn> Yes, if needed. (more)

[17:02] <jnthn> These days we mostly just decontainerize the incoming value and put that in the lexpad, so avoid creating a new Scalar. BUT Scalar also plays the role of a "this doesn't flatten" indicator.

[17:02] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v camelia

[17:02] *** ugator left
[17:02] <jnthn> So if we get someting in that would flatten, we still need the Scalar

[17:03] <jnthn> Either way provides the "can't assign" semantics we need.

[17:04] <jnthn> And the cheaper one is the better one, naturally. :)

[17:04] <jnthn> The only way I know of to actually spot that the optimization happens if with using uppercase thingies to go introspecting...

[17:05] *** [Sno] left
[17:06] <smls> Is that behavior (creating a new non-rw-Scalar if needed) specced and conceptually part of the language, or is it just an implementation detail and it's ok to think of the whole thing in a more high-level sense as "read-only alias"?

[17:06] <smls> ( asking for http://imgur.com/a/An3k4 )

[17:07] <jnthn> Well, the alias language to me has always been more about contrasting it with the more copy-ish semantics in Perl 5.

[17:08] <jnthn> The exactly thing Rakudo does isn't spec'd.

[17:08] <jnthn> But I think it's an acceptable optimization.

[17:11] <smls> ok, thanks

[17:11] *** grettis joined
[17:17] <TimToady> well, actually, P5 is purely ref semantics at the @_ level, it's the my ($a,$b,@c) = @_ that typically does the copy

[17:18] <TimToady> the spec language is such that if you can prove that nothing is trying to modify the ref arg or use its item nature, it doesn't need to be itemized

[17:19] <TimToady> but it also allows pass by value

[17:19] <TimToady> so if you already have something that is a value, and bind to normal parameter, it can just pass it "raw"

[17:20] <vendethiel-> ezra1: that's all there is (jnthn's slides)

[17:20] <vendethiel-> there's a *VERY* short article somewhere, but that's about it

[17:21] <TimToady> moritz: how hard would it be to set up a temporary camelia on the 6-core in my house?

[17:21] <vendethiel-> arnsholt: ooh, you're back on snake :D?

[17:21] <smls> with "something that is a value" do you mean just things like Int and Str object that are known to be immutable value types?

[17:21] *** ugator joined
[17:21] <smls> or objects of custom types as well?

[17:22] *** ptc_p6 joined
[17:22] <TimToady> I'm not sure how it introspects that currently, but the intent is to treat user-defined value types as value types, in addition to the builtins

[17:23] <TimToady> functionally, a value type as a WHICH that doesn't depend on its locatoin

[17:23] <TimToady> *has

[17:23] <PerlJam> .oO( why don't we have several machines backing camelia yet? )

[17:23] <vendethiel-> concurrent camelias

[17:23] <TimToady> but that's an operational definition, not a reflective one

[17:32] <jnthn> timotimo: Probably possible, I just wonder how easy/cheap the check can be.

[17:32] <jnthn> timotimo: The sub-typing relation probably gets fun. It may just fall out of what we already have, though...

[17:33] <jnthn> The whole parametric stuff is getting a good going over when I get back from vacation, though.

[17:33] <jnthn> So we can get rid of a load of those "Expected Array[Int] but got Array[Int]" WTFs.

[17:34] <jnthn> And cache mixins.

[17:34] <timotimo> that sounds good :)

[17:34] <jnthn> And have the two work out properly with serialization stuff, which means some kind of interning.

[17:34] <jnthn> I have a design sketched out.

[17:35] <timotimo> how do you feel about the two goals on moarvm.org's roadmap?

[17:35] <timotimo> better optimization around closures and the stability improvements for threads/async

[17:35] <jnthn> The GLR might be helped by #1.

[17:35] <jnthn> #2 is really needed.

[17:36] <jnthn> Won't have much for this release :(

[17:36] <jnthn> The roadmap really needs an update though

[17:36] <jnthn> So it can be focused on the moar aspects of things we need for 6.0.0

[17:36] <jnthn> So, NSA, GLR, and NFG.

[17:37] <jnthn> And I think the N bit of NSA is going to come before NFG at this point.

[17:39] <leont> Sounds good

[17:39] <jnthn> Think it should cover us for some aspects of coercion types too.

[17:40] <leont> Yes please!

[17:40] <jnthn> Anyway, that's what I hope to be working on post-vacation...

[17:41] <leont> I like typed programming, but I keep running into various issues there :-/

[17:42] <jnthn> Yeah...well, some of them are real bugs (like the bogus error), and then some are mis-placed at the boundary of typed and untyped code.

[17:42] <jnthn> *mis-placed exceptations

[17:43] <jnthn> e.g. thinking that sub foo(Int @a) { }; foo([1, 2, 3]) is going to work out because it's an Array that happens to contain Int

[17:43] <leont> I'd like some way to make that work

[17:43] <jnthn> At best, you'll get some sugar.

[17:43] <leont> e.g. some kind of coercion

[17:43] <jnthn> (For Array[Int].new(1, 2, 3))

[17:44] <jnthn> But yeah, it'll have to be a coercion, which means copying, which means it should be weighty enough to not look like it's "free"

[17:45] <[Coke]> LHF: https://github.com/coke/perl6-roast-data/blob/master/log/rakudo.jvm_summary.out#L1726 - this test is failing because it assumes the suggestions are in a particular order when they are not.

[17:47] <smls> jnthn: Maybe a general mechanism for saying "Do not apply this type check to the input directly; instead, try to coerce the input to the required type and only throw an exception if that fails"

[17:47] *** ptc_p61 joined
[17:48] <jnthn> The reason it actually has to be an Array[Int], to be clear, is because a [...] thingy is mutable, and so even if you did go looking at "what does it contain" at the point of a type check, then proceed onwards assuming that's what you really have (or the optimizer assumes), something could at-a-distance add a thingy of a different type into the array.

[17:48] <jnthn> smls: Yeah, I wonder if sub foo(Int() @a) { ... } can be made to work.

[17:48] *** ptc_p6 left
[17:49] <jnthn> But it'll have to be special-cased, I think...

[17:49] <jnthn> To imply "is copy" I guess...

[17:50] <leont> Couldn't ´Int @a is copyª be enough?

[17:50] <jnthn> Hm

[17:50] <jnthn> Well, it'd mean something else I guess...

[17:50] <jnthn> (as in, actually check the values)

[17:51] <jnthn> And somehow we'd have to make it suppress the check on what is coming in.

[17:51] <jnthn> Which feels a little off. But it's 5am here so I probably shouldn't be trying to design type stuff. :)

[17:51] <smls> ¬´To imply "is copy" I guess...¬ª - or simply fail at compile time if it is used without "is copy", requiring the user to be explicit (and making sure they know what they're doing)

[17:52] <jnthn> smls: That'd be more conservative, yes

[17:52] *** rurban joined
[17:53] <leont> ´without "is copy"ª is a bit harsh, but demanding some kind of "is ro/rw/copy" might work

[17:53] <jnthn> *nod*

[17:54] <jnthn> It still means a sort of special case though

[17:54] *** danaj_ left
[17:55] <jnthn> I mean, it's more that you want to convey Array[Int]() rathe rthan Array[Int()]

[17:55] <jnthn> But it's not too easy to know where to dangle the () when writing it as Int @arr

[17:56] <jnthn> And Int @arr() already means something. :)

[17:57] <timotimo> @arr is Array[Int(Any)]?

[17:57] <jnthn> timotimo: That does it, yes

[18:25] <moritz> I just want to run camelia somewhere where it doesn't time out

[18:33] <masak> (that is, the important part of the above syntax is that variables are quasi-spliced by default. if you wanted to avoid that (and just represent a regular variable in the code), you'd have to `\$val`)

[18:34] <vendethiel-> masak: I feel a bit... uneasy about current "scoping" things, btw

[18:35] <vendethiel-> like, macro { $a = 1; quasi { say $a } }; #kind of surprised it works

[18:35] <masak> vendethiel-: you are? why?

[18:35] <vendethiel-> I'd expect something non-unquoted to be "from outside"

[18:37] *** virtualsue joined
[18:38] <masak> if I get what you're saying, you're suggesting a kind of non-hygiene.

[18:39] <vendethiel-> erm, not really

[18:39] <masak> then, explain yourself ;)

[18:39] <vendethiel-> I'm suggesting I should have to unquote stuff from outside the quasi

[18:39] <vendethiel-> *even if they're not parameters*

[18:39] <vendethiel-> yes, just leave me some time to write it down :P

[18:39] * masak breathes down the neck of vendethiel- :P

[18:40] *** FROGGS left
[18:40] <masak> whether something is a parmeter or not is kinda beside the point. you can unquote any AST object, no matter where it came from.

[18:41] * jnthn notes that his only real use of macros in a module relied on the current semantics ;)

[18:41] <masak> yeah, I'm not convinced at all.

[18:42] <masak> the current semantics feels like one of the conceptually solid points of the macro implementation.

[18:42] <vendethiel-> ..it did not

[18:42] <vendethiel-> I'm just suggesting you need

[18:42] <vendethiel-> my $a = 1; quasi { say {{{$a}}} };

[18:42] <jnthn> In general, lexical scoping (and its visual nature) have served us quite well already

[18:43] <vendethiel-> ... I'm not arguing against it. Or against hygiene

[18:43] <jnthn> vendethiel-: But 1 is a literal Int, not an AST, so no need to AST inrepolate it.

[18:43] <vendethiel-> moving a parameter to a local shouldn't have you change the use

[18:43] <masak> vendethiel-: that... looks so wrong to me.

[18:43] <masak> vendethiel-: are you *sure* you're not misunderstanding how macros currently work?

[18:43] <vendethiel-> I am

[18:43] <masak> I am strongly suggesting you should be less sure ;)

[18:44] <jnthn> :P

[18:44] <jnthn> OK, time to ponder moving gate-wards, methinks...

[18:44] <jnthn> o/

[18:44] <masak> \o

[18:44] <colomon> o/

[18:45] <vendethiel-> I know how macros work.

[18:45] <masak> yes, you do.

[18:45] <vendethiel-> this is not about implementation details, more about semantics

[18:46] <vendethiel-> macros have "level". I can (or should be able to, I guess) have macro generating macros, etc. Not choosing at which level it's "unquoted" makes me very uneasy

[18:46] <masak> vendethiel-: here's the invariant your proposal is breaking: whenever we do {{{$x}}}, then $x ~~ AST

[18:46] <masak> vendethiel-: 1 !~~ AST

[18:47] <vendethiel-> I know that

[18:47] <masak> you still haven't really motivated to me how that isn't a problem with your proposal...

[18:47] <masak> or if you did, it went by me.

[18:47] <vendethiel-> because I'm not talking about technical "details" here

[18:47] <vendethiel-> I'm just talking about consistency

[18:47] <vendethiel-> if I have, say...

[18:48] <vendethiel-> macro foo($bar) { my $a = 1; quasi { macro somename { quasi { say {{{$bar}}} + $a; } } } }

[18:48] <vendethiel-> this feels terribly wrong.

[18:48] <masak> *not to me*.

[18:49] <masak> what you're proposing feels terribly wrong.

[18:49] *** treehug88 left
[18:49] <masak> seems we're at an impasse, though, where neither of us can manage to explain our viewpoint to the other...

[18:49] <mauke> how do I interpolate a value of type AST under the new proposal?

[18:49] <vendethiel-> masak: I can manage to explain my viewpoint...

[18:50] <vendethiel-> It's just that I'm taking next to *every single macro system in existence* and trying to get the same... consistency

[18:50] <vendethiel-> well, we're probably the only ones with that kind of "AST nodes" thingies

[18:51] <moritz> huh?

[18:51] <vendethiel-> huh?

[18:51] <moritz> in lisp, the AST nodes are simply lists

[18:51] <vendethiel-> .. which also applies to variables assigned

[18:51] <vendethiel-> not here

[18:51] *** treehug88 joined
[18:51] <moritz> so we're hardly the only ones

[18:52] <masak> we're definitely not the only ones.

[18:52] <vendethiel-> changing `macro ($foo) { }` to `macro { my $foo; }` makes you change every single appearance of $foo in the quasi

[18:52] <masak> though I do confess I haven't found two macro systems yet that work exactly alike.

[18:52] <masak> vendethiel-: no, you're missing the point.

[18:53] <masak> vendethiel-: you don't have to change anything if `my $foo` contains an AST.

[18:53] <vendethiel-> right.

[18:53] *** gfldex joined
[18:53] <moritz> the problem is just that currently, ASTs only come from parameters

[18:53] <moritz> we need to change that

[18:53] <vendethiel-> yes.

[18:53] <timotimo> yes please

[18:53] <vendethiel-> I'd be very happy with some kind of quoting, actually

[18:53] <masak> vendethiel-: if that's *not* the case, then whatever you're doing with that refactor that makes something not be an AST, you must be *very* confused.

[18:54] <vendethiel-> so I can do like, my $a = }}}1{{{;

[18:54] <vendethiel-> *g* # syntaxes++

[18:54] * masak .oO( because {{{ }}} wasn't horrible enough... )

[18:55] <vendethiel-> *g*¬≤

[18:55] <masak> re "ASTs only come from parameters" -- wrong.

[18:55] <masak> they also come from quasis.

[18:55] <timotimo> masak: don't forget to never make it impossible to have higher order macros!

[18:55] <vendethiel-> m: macro { my $a = quasi { 1 } }

[19:06] <timotimo> hmm

[19:07] <mauke> I expect uses of foo to create AST values

[19:07] <masak> mauke: a use of `foo()` simplifies down to `quasi { 42 }`

[19:22] <vendethiel-> I'm gonna need a shower now... brb

[19:28] <masak> if by "natural language" you mean cussing, babbling, and saying "this" a lot.

[19:28] <mauke> f(this);

[19:29] <tony-o> javascript is far and away the least natural sounding language

[19:29] <tony-o> of the ones that aren't intentionally obscure

[19:29] <moritz> "this."

[19:30] <moritz> though I disagree

[19:30] <tony-o> javascript, where 'this' can be literally anything

[19:30] <moritz> 'defun' sounds a lot less naturally to me than 'function'

[19:32] <tony-o> you can pick things out where it works, sure, it's not something i'd consider natural language though

[19:34] * brrt has always had a weak spot for scheme

[19:36] <tony-o> i love js and perl - i just don't think js resembles natural language

[19:56] <Ven> masak: really, the only thing bugging me is that, in lisp, this: 

[19:57] <Ven> "let ((a 1)) `(a ,a))" gives me "(A 1)" (in CL)

[19:57] *** _slade_ left
[19:58] <Ven> and "(let ((a '(1 2))) `(a ,a))" gives "(A (1 2))". You don't have to use a different syntax or anything because it's from a let. 

[19:58] <Ven> But of course, our non-homoiconicity bites us.

[19:59] <Ven> (elixir mostly gets away with not being homoiconic by having a very "simple" ast format

[20:02] <mauke> it's homoiconic! see, code is made of strings and strings are also a data structure

[20:02] <Ven> Strings are probably the worst kind of data structure :)

[20:02] <Ven> along with integers and booleans

[20:02] <mauke> ok, so in lisp 1 == quasi { 1 }

[20:04] <mauke> that's how lisp gets away with only having {{{ }}}

[20:04] <Ven> i.e., `(,'1) is just (1)
