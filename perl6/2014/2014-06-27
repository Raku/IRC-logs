[10:48] <ChoHag> Can I tell if an attribute has been set (either with an accessor, internally by the class or at initialisation) as opposed to using its default value?

[10:49] <FROGGS> ChoHag: only when you create a Proxy, and do something in its STORE method

[10:49] <FROGGS> but that is ugly

[10:50] <FROGGS> ChoHag: why do you care? would it be a problem when somebody sets something that is identical to the default value?

[10:50] <ChoHag> On a related not, can I set attributes (or methods) on attributes?

[10:50] <ChoHag> Probably not.

[10:51] <ChoHag> That is - it probably doesn't matter.

[10:51] <ChoHag> I can apply my own trait to an attribute but I can't, among other things, tell if an attribute has had that trait applied to it.

[10:55] <FROGGS> I guess introspecting applied traits is on the roadmap...

[13:58] <TimToady> interesting

[13:58] <Ven> TimToady: that's not by design ?

[13:58] <TimToady> arguably role A and class A are two different things

[13:58] <TimToady> but with the pun, I don't think it's terrible to confuse them

[13:58] <Ven> we a lisp/6 now :) ?

[13:58] <timotimo> if you can't confuse them, the pun didn't work

[13:59] <TimToady> a punnable role is really just a way to write a composable class, in a sense

[14:00] <TimToady> the dicey bit is that the role is immutable, and the class is mutable, so it could diverge over time from its role

[14:00] <timotimo> OOP is hard, let's go shopping

[14:01] <TimToady> monkey typing will change the class, not the role

[14:01] <timotimo> we already have trouble with monkey typing changes not applying everywhere they ought to

[14:01] <TimToady> well, that's mostly because the bootstrap abstraction leaks

[20:28] <vendethiel> Okay, so, I have a dilemna.

[20:28] <vendethiel> Do I show `join ',', @a` or `@a.join(',')` ??

[20:29] <moritz> the answer is clearly "yes"

[20:29] <lizmat> whatever you feel more comfortable with

[20:29] <lizmat> I feel the latter is slightly more perl6y

[20:29] <vendethiel> moritz: thanks.

[20:29] <jercos> personally I'd prefer the latter, or join(',', @a)

[20:30] <jercos> leaving joins open-ended like that feels off, possibly from perl5 habit

[20:30] <vendethiel> uh ?

[20:30] <moritz> if it's the last statement in a line, I prefer the @a.join: ',' form

[20:31] <vendethiel> I'm not showing the : stuff 123 lines into the tutorial :P

[20:32] <TimToady> open-ended join ',', ... is for when ... is long

[20:33] <vendethiel> uh² ?

[20:33] <vendethiel> so, @a.join ?

[20:34] <TimToady> talking about end-weight

[20:34] * vendethiel is getting lost

[20:34] <TimToady> short things want to be before long tings

[20:34] <vendethiel> that was probably a terrible question to ask, anyway

[20:35] <psch> did you show .split or split before? 

[20:35] <psch> i.e. if you're mostly doing method-y stuff, stay with methods, if not, don't

[20:35] <jercos> I guess the existance of say sorta eliminates the odd case of |print join ",", @a, @b, "\n"| "oh whoops, gotta add parens on that join."

[20:35] <psch> and add a "most of those also work as sub/methods" somewhere

[20:35] <TimToady> and one sometimes wants to avoid having parentheses that go many lines

[20:35] <vendethiel> psch: I only showed say

[20:36] <TimToady> so, for instance, something like: say join ',', gather for @stuff { blah, blah, blah, take blah, blah }

[20:37] <TimToady> puting an entire gather into () is a bit crufty, just to put a .join(',') at the end

[20:37] <psch> i'd actually go with join ',', @a first and mention that it also works as method

[20:38] <psch> but that's just how i imagine it to flow well, ymmv

[20:39] *** labster left
[20:40] <vendethiel> psch: that could be a good time to introduce readers to methods, though

[20:40] *** labster joined
[20:41] <psch> yeah, that's why i said you show the sub and transition to "it also works as method" :)

[22:51] <vendethiel> Or, other people here, for that matters.

[22:52] <psch> not the wrong direction per se, but the nature of the beast just means that many sub-concepts that apply to the concepts you want to teach also apply to other concepts

[22:52] <psch> i.e. the part about 'is rw'

[22:52] <vendethiel> which is definitely why I feel like I'm going all out.

[22:52] <vendethiel> yeah, don't wanna talk about containers

[22:52] <psch> you need to show it for mutable attributes, but you don't have to show it for lvalue subs

[23:19] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[23:19] <psch> hm, http://doc.perl6.org/routine/%2F%2F also doesn't work

[23:19] <lizmat> the semi-colon is not what it seems to be

[23:19] <psch> i guess that means the webserver doesn't have (an equivalent to) ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASHES set

[23:24] <psch> although yoleaux should probably name all of them..?

[23:24] <BenGoldberg> yoleaux seems to be limited to outputing three lines.

[23:25] <jnthn> oh, duh :)

[23:29] <segomos_> does nativecall handle mapping objects to the perl6 class? as in if i have a c library that returns a c struct, do i need to implement the p6 class to inherit CStruct and have the same order or names or both?

[23:30] <jnthn> Names don't matter; types and order does.

[23:30] <jnthn> It's not about inheritance, but rather representation.

[23:32] <BenGoldberg> I hope your c library function doesn't actually return a struct ... returning a pointer to a struct seems a little more likely.

[23:32] <segomos_> so if i have a char* should i use a str or an opaquepointer ?

[23:33] <segomos_> BenGoldberg: it's libxml2 - it does return the pointer

[23:33] <jnthn> Depends.

[23:33] <jnthn> If it's actually string data, then str

[23:33] *** jnap left
[23:35] <zengargo1le> TimToady: that clock is rather neat, needs U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK between characters. otherwise they end up touching or squished together sometimes (at least in my terminal/font/...).

[23:36] <segomos_> so if i want to read a char* with other data i should probably use a Buf?

[23:38] <segomos_> actually it looks like i can't do much with it if i have opaquepointer
