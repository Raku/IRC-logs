[10:35] <masak> in the interests of 'release early', here's the proto installer I talked about yesterday: http://github.com/masak/proto/

[10:35] <masak> it currently detects if you have Parrot and Rakudo installed, otherwise it installs them for you.

[10:36] <masak> it's _very_ primitive, but it Works On My System

[10:36] <masak> be happy to receive reports from other Perl 6 developers that it works for them too.

[10:36] <masak> there are two ways to test it:

[10:36] <masak> 1. running the shell script with Parrot and Rakudo installed. the script should immediately exit successfully.

[10:37] <masak> 2. running the script after hiding the value of $PARROT_DIR. the script should download and install Parrot and Rakudo, and exit successfully.

[10:39] <masak> I'm a bash script ignoramus, so I'd appreciate review of the script itself as well.

[11:24] <szabgab> masak, who or what else is using PARROT_DIR and is it defined somewhere where should it point to ?

[11:24] <masak> szabgab: I'll have to think about that a bit. we use it in November.

[11:25] <masak> perl6-examples also uses it.

[11:25] <szabgab> what is perl6-examples?

[11:25] <masak> but I'm not sure whether it originated there or whether it's a Parrot standard.

[11:25] <masak> szabgab: https://github.com/eric256/perl6-examples/

[11:25] <masak> contains some really cool stuff.

[11:25] <szabgab> thanks I'll look at it

[11:26] <szabgab> in Padre we require a PARROT_PATH variable to point to the root of the checked out trunk of parrot

[11:26] <masak> that's what we call PARROT_DIR

[11:27] <szabgab> so I'll change the name to PARROT_DIR

[11:27] <masak> szabgab++

[11:27] <szabgab> but I'd really like it people writing perl 6 code would check out padre and the perl 6 plugin

[11:27] <masak> hm, Druid also uses it. I can't think of who first introduced it in November. maybe viklund.

[11:28] <masak> szabgab: I'm on Mac OS X. is there any way I can use Padre?

[11:28] <szabgab> there were some success reports on Mac though it is generally still a pain

[11:29] <szabgab> mainly due to wxwidgets issues

[11:29] <masak> that, along with general Emacs addiction, keeps me from using Padre right now.

[11:29] <masak> but yes, I should give it a shot.

[11:30] <szabgab> actually Teejay is quite close to an emacs plugin for Padre

[11:30] <masak> szabgab: I'm sure you mean well, but... :)

[11:31] <szabgab> do you sometimes write extensions to emacs?

[11:32] <masak> no, I haven't gotten that far yet. but I think about it sometimes.

[11:32] <masak> last summer I delved deeper into Emacs, with great results.

[11:32] <masak> but it takes time.

[11:32] <masak> I'm also a very satisfied vim user. come to think of it, I do most of my Perl 6 coding in vim.

[11:33] <szabgab> so what if you wrote your editor extensions in perl 5 or perl 6 ?

[11:34] <masak> szabgab: I... ooh! :)

[11:34] * masak will consider the implications of this

[11:35] * SamB doesn't think trying to integrate perl and elisp is the greatest idea ?

[11:35] <masak> SamB: build it, and they will come.

[12:39] <masak> moritz_: see logs from yesterday. it's a build system.

[12:39] <masak> https://github.com/masak/proto

[12:40] <masak> please, everyone, give it a whirl and see that it works on your box.

[12:40] <masak> szabgab: I'm adding you too.

[12:40] <moritz_> masak: nice

[12:40] <masak> moritz_: thank you. :)

[12:41] * moritz_ won't protest against commit privileges

[12:41] <masak> moritz_: good, 'cus you already have them.

[12:41] <masak> I'm learning bash scripting on the go. :)

[12:45] <masak> moritz_: do you know where the env variable PARROT_DIR originated? the first mention of it in November is August 20th, when it was renamed from PARROT_PATH to PARROT_DIR without explanation.

[12:45] <masak> I'm curious whether November got it from somewhere or if it originated there.

[12:46] <moritz_> masak: no idea, but it seems sensible to rename it from path to dir

[12:46] <masak> aye.

[12:47] <masak> I guess I'll just have to ask viklund.

[13:08] <Matt-W> SamB: yes of course it has syntax... the problem with lisp-like syntax is that it consists almost entirely of ( and )

[13:09] <masak> Matt-W: I found that to be a problem in the beginning as well.

[13:09] <masak> turns out the secret to handling that lies in good indentation practices.

[13:10] <masak> (as well as having an editor that does paren highlighting, but all decent editors do that, right?)

[13:10] <Matt-W> which, actually, applies to a lot of language

[13:10] <masak> _especially_ python.

[13:10] <Matt-W> C++ needs good indentation to be readable

[13:10] <Matt-W> heh yes, Python just happens to enforce it

[13:10] <Matt-W> Haskell does too, although there's a non-indenty syntax available as well

[13:11] <moritz_> that's quite cool having both syntaxes available

[13:11] <Matt-W> yeah

[13:11] <Matt-W> the thing is though

[13:11] <cls_bsd> agree

[13:12] <Matt-W> most people who use the non-indenty one seem to lay it out almost exactly like they were using the offside rule syntax

[13:12] <Matt-W> so I don't quite see the point, as they're just using extra characters to say the same thing

[13:12] <Matt-W> But if it keeps them happy...

[13:12] <masak> :)

[13:13] <moritz_> Matt-W: it always makes me happy if I do things voluntarily, and not because I'm force to

[13:13] <masak> Matt-W: do you have a github account?

[13:13] <Matt-W> I don't see why syntactically-significant indentation is such a strong issue with some people

[13:13] <pugs_svn> r25217 | hinrik++ | [util/perl6.vim] allow m// to take adverbs starting with a digit, also highlight almost all Perl 5 regex constructs in m:P5//

[13:13] <Matt-W> it's not like C gives you any options about using { ; }

[13:14] <Matt-W> I think it's just because some people like writing messy code

[13:14] <Matt-W> masak: yes

[13:14] <masak> Matt-W: what's the username?

[13:14] <Matt-W> ummm

[13:14] <Matt-W> err

[13:14] <Matt-W> let me check

[13:14] <masak> :P

[13:14] <Matt-W> mattw

[13:15] <Matt-W> it's a fairly new account and I've not used it much yet

[13:15] <Matt-W> one repo with nothing in it

[13:15] <masak> Matt-W: added you as a proto admin.

[13:15] <masak> I'm adding everybody, because I want to emphasize that we're all in this together :)

[13:16] <Matt-W> heh

[13:16] <Matt-W> and also you're hoping that I'll take the hint and write some of the code?

[13:16] <masak> in this case, no.

[13:17] <masak> I want to write it myself :)

[13:17] <Matt-W> Oh okay

[13:17] <masak> but I want everyone to have access to information about their own modules.

[13:17] <masak> in case they need to change something.

[13:17] <Matt-W> mm, good plan

[13:23] <masak> plan of action during the next few days: establish a list of all extant Perl 6 projects on github, and make sure they can be installed through './proto install <module'

[13:24] <masak> after that, create the first dependency (most likely by moving out something from November)

[13:24] <masak> hm, I need to write to the november-wiki mailing list and alert the november devs about proto...

[13:29] <masak> viklund thinks he invented PARROT_DIR, btw.

[13:39] * Matt-W wiggles his fingers and wonders what he can depend upon from November

[13:40] <masak> there are some goodies in there.

[13:41] <masak> I'm especially proud of the markup parsers, of course.

[13:41] <masak> but there's also a whole lot of web stuff.

[15:12] <masak> moritz_: I'm getting a strange error in proto when building without PARROT_DIR set.

[15:12] <masak> I was wondering if you (or someone else) could try and reproduce it.

[15:12] <ruoso> Hello!

[15:13] <moritz_> masak: how do I run it?

[15:14] <masak> moritz_: just ./proto in that dir.

[15:14] <masak> but if you have a PARROT_DIR set, you'll have to unset that first.

[15:15] <moritz_> masak: http://nopaste.snit.ch/15510

[15:15] <masak> ah :)

[15:15] <masak> so we have more fundamental errors to deal with first.

[15:15] <masak> if you want a quick fix, it's this:

[15:16] <masak> which perl > /dev/null

[15:16] <masak> on line 14 of the script

[15:16] <masak> and same but s/perl/git/ on l 23.

[15:16] <masak> meanwhile, I'll commit that. :)

[15:17] <masak> there, pushed.

[15:21] <moritz_> Build succeeded strangely. Giving up. See make.log for details.

[15:21] <masak> aye.

[15:21] <masak> it's parrot-0.9.0/languages/rakudo/make.log

[15:21] <moritz_> I just found that :-)

[15:22] <masak> I'm changing that error message to 'Build failed' as we speak. :) much clearer.

[15:22] <moritz_> ./perl6str.pmc:168: error: ‘PARROT_FLOATVAL_INF_POSITIVE’ undeclared (first use in this function)

[15:22] <masak> yes, but why?

[15:23] <masak> the only difference, as far as I know, is that we're using the public clone URL here.

[15:23] <moritz_> masak: no, you also export PARROT_DIR, don't you?

[15:25] <masak> um, yes...

[15:25] <masak> but I usually build Rakudo with PARROT_DIR set.

[15:28] <masak> besides, why would the exportation of PARROT_DIR affect the Rakudo build process?

[15:30] <moritz_> dunno

[15:31] <masak> moritz_: anyway, thanks for confirming. I'll try and track down the error.
