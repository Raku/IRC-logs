[07:42] <samdc> but i'm getting error message:

[07:42] <samdc> Unable to locate parrot_config.

[07:43] *** mberends joined
[07:43] <samdc> what is parrot_config for?

[07:44] <samdc> btw, i'm following this procedure: http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo

[07:45] <samdc> anybody?

[07:47] *** rindolf left
[07:57] *** masak joined
[07:58] <mikehh> rakudo is Perl6 built on the parroy VM and parrot_config is the file that shows where to find all the parrot libraries

[07:59] <samdc> yeah, i realized that, i'm building parrot now from source

[07:59] <samdc> after that, what exactly shall i put in parrot_config?

[08:02] <mikehh> when you configure rakudo before the build (make) do perl Confogure.pl --parrot-config=[location of the parrot_config file in parrot]

[08:04] <samdc> cool

[08:04] <samdc> i'm building rakudo now

[08:04] *** renormalist left
[08:05] <mikehh> for example I have parrot built in dir parrot and rakudo in dir rakudo and do in rakudo - perl Configure.pl parrot-config=,,.parrot/parrot_config

[08:05] <mikehh> s\,,.\../\

[08:06] <samdc> i did that, but now i got this error:

[08:09] <masak> samdc: sounds like you might be having inconsistent Parrot and Rakudo versions.

[08:11] <samdc> for parrot, i checked out from svn co https://svn.parrot.org/parrot/trunk parrot 

[08:11] <masak> manually? you don't need to do that.

[08:12] <samdc> oh, is there a way to do that automatically?

[08:12] <samdc> how?

[08:12] <masak> just use the --gen-parrot option to Configure.pl

[08:12] <samdc> i did that, and it's giving me error

[08:12] <masak> oh. ok.

[08:12] * masak tries that locally

[08:12] <samdc> "Unable to locate parrot_config."

[08:14] <masak> for me, it's checking out Parrot r37980.

[08:15] <masak> now building Parrot.

[08:15] <samdc> I tried again, and still i get this message: Building Parrot ...

[08:15] <samdc> Unable to locate parrot_config.

[08:15] <samdc> To automatically checkout (svn) and build a copy of parrot,

[08:15] <samdc> try re-running Configure.pl with the '--gen-parrot' option.

[08:15] <samdc> Or, use the '--parrot-config' option to explicitly specify

[08:15] <samdc> the location of parrot_config.

[08:17] <samdc> wait, i also got this error message: via svn...t Parrot r37980

[08:17] <samdc> 'vn: Syntax error in revision argument '37980

[08:18] <masak> Parrot built correctly here.

[15:53] <moritz_> thanks

[15:56] <moritz_> szabgab: I just wrote the perl.org webmasters, sorry that I forgot that for nearly a week :/

[15:57] <moritz_> to add your RSS feed to the planetsix subscription list

[15:57] <szabgab> I asked them to include my plog in the perlsix planet

[16:02] <moritz_> szabgab: ah, just got a reply from Robert: "The request has been passed along to the owner of planetsix.  He's

[16:02] <moritz_> travelling this week, and we hope he'll get back to us soon.

[16:02] <jnthn> moritz_: Hope you're having a nice break. :-)

[19:07] <masak> to be honest, I could use the peace and quiet.

[19:11] <masak> I should try and finish these slides, so I can get back to hacking Perl 6...

[19:12] <masak> good idea.
