[03:22] <s1n> anyone overly familiar with the grammer (src/parser/grammer.pg)?

[03:22] <s1n> TimToady, jnthn, pmichaud: i'm looking at you guys

[03:23] <mtnviewmark> I know a little about src/perl6/STD.pm

[03:23] <mtnviewmark> er, which repo are you talking 'bout?

[03:24] <s1n> mtnviewmark: rakudo

[03:24] <s1n> it's soft of a general question

[03:24] <mtnviewmark> ah - sorry - nope, I only know about the perl6 parser in perl6

[03:24] <s1n> does C<<?>> imply optional?

[03:24] <mtnviewmark> but if it's general about the language, give it a shot

[03:24] <mtnviewmark> in what context?

[03:25] <mtnviewmark> like, give me a sample expresion

[03:25] <s1n> expressions, specifically the loop structure

[03:25] <s1n> sure

[03:25] <s1n> <e1=EXPR>? ';'

[03:25] <s1n> does that mean e1 is optional followed by a C<<;>>?

[03:25] <mtnviewmark> ah - you mean in regex -- yes that is zero or one time

[03:25] *** Tene joined
[03:25] <mtnviewmark> correct

[03:26] <s1n> oh, that translates directly to a regex?

[03:26] <mtnviewmark> actually, that means EXPR is optional (locally renamed e1)

[03:26] <mtnviewmark> well -- if it is in the context of a regex, that is what that means

[03:26] <s1n> how do i know what the context is?

[03:26] <mtnviewmark> so inside a rexep, token or rule construction

[03:26] <mtnviewmark> like this:   

[03:27] <mtnviewmark> std: rule STMT { <EXPR>? ';' }

[03:27] <p6eval> std 25179: OUTPUT«00:02 32m␤»

[03:27] <mtnviewmark> see - even parses!

[03:27] <mtnviewmark> so things that start with regex, token or rule are regex's....

[03:27] <mtnviewmark> things that start sub or method are not

[03:27] <s1n> neat!

[03:27] <mtnviewmark> things that are in regex quotes are also regexs so:

[03:28] <s1n> i can make the std parse grammers!

[03:28] <mtnviewmark> $a ~~ / <EXPR>? ';' /;

[03:28] <mtnviewmark> yes prefixing with std: here asks the perl6 parser in perl6 (translated into perl5) to parse it

[03:28] <s1n> well i didn't know it did grammers too

[03:28] <mtnviewmark> prefixing with perl6: asks all the on-line implementations to evaluate it

[12:00] <masak> I don't think we need to worry about Perl 6 being inadequate for ibfuscation purposes.

[12:03] <jnthn> Well, it is still Perl. ;-)

[12:04] <masak> in some ways even more so. :)

[12:04] * jnthn hopes to get to a little Rakudo hacking today

[12:04] <masak> YaY!

[12:04] <masak> it is much needed.

[12:06] <jnthn> But next week I will for sure get one in.

[12:06] <masak> ok.

[12:07] <jnthn> If not two to make up for this week.

[12:07] <masak> jnthn++

[12:07] <jnthn> So a list of your most ouch-ish bugs would be helpful.

[12:07] <jnthn> The RT queue is rather large.

[12:07] <masak> yeah, who did that?

[12:07] <jnthn> I can't imagine. :-P

[12:07] <jnthn> Has pmichaud been seen at all recently?

[12:07] <moritz_> yesterday around parrotsketch time

[12:08] <jnthn> Ah, he posted on the Parrot mailing list...

[12:08] <jnthn> Oh, yes.

[12:08] <jnthn> I was on a plane that was failing to land at that point in time...

[12:23] <jnthn> I gave the GIT instructions in my talk in Sofia.

[19:04] <pmichaud> szabgab: Test.pm turns off the warnings.

[19:04] <pmichaud> szabgab: because people were complaining about all of the "Use of uninitialized value" warnings coming from the test suite.

[19:04] <szabgab> why ?

[19:05] <szabgab> wow

[19:05] <szabgab> can we have a flag for this?

[19:05] <pmichaud> you can turn the warnings back on, yes.

[19:05] <pmichaud> our $*WARNINGS = 1;

[19:06] <pmichaud> (not standard Perl 6 -- it's rakudo specific.)

[19:06] <szabgab> and can I catch warnings ?

[19:06] <pmichaud> I'm not sure what the current state of catching warnings is.

[19:10] <szabgab> so what is Rakudo specific the $*WARNINGS variable ?
