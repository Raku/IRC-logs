[12:11] <moritz_> lichtkind: most implementations so far were compilers (rakudo, elf, mildew), pugs is a hybrid

[12:11] <moritz_> calling them "Interpreters" is rather misleading

[12:11] <lichtkind> moritz_: yes but thats not for technical consumer, jsut simpel english

[12:13] <lichtkind> moritz_: yes its still in progress

[12:14] <lichtkind> moritz_: + i already fixed that in pugs section

[12:15] <moritz_> (if you want a general term, use "implementaitions" instead of "interpreter" or "compiler")

[12:15] <lichtkind> ah true thaanks

[12:17] <Matt-W> I recommend 'implementations', for the sake of any spell checkers which might stumble along :)

[12:42] <last> Hi all.

[12:42] <last> Just grabbed the latest Rakudo via git, and make test fails on my Mac.

[12:42] <last> (Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask about it / report it.)

[12:43] <moritz_> last: it's the right place

[12:44] <moritz_> last: what's the error?

[12:45] <last> t/01-sanity/07-isa.................1/3 Method 'succ' not found for invocant of class 'Block'

[12:46] <last> (I do (and did this time) perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot to get parrot.)

[12:46] <moritz_> uhm, rakudo just stopped building here, so I can't try it :/

[12:47] <moritz_> last: could you please open a ticket by mailing to [email@hidden.address]
[12:48] <last> Sure thing.  What should I include?

[12:49] <moritz_> last: version (either release or the git SHA hash that 'git log' shows at the top), platform and error message

[12:50] <last> Roger.  Will get on that ASAP.  Thanks.

[12:50] <moritz_> thank you for testing.

[17:53] <goksie> Su-Shee.. sorry for bordering you.. what rev of parrot did u checked out

[17:53] <goksie> 39633?

[17:54] <Su-Shee> goksie: uhm good question, next question. ;) "the one rakudo pulled" ;)

[17:54] *** dukeleto left
[17:54] <goksie> yes

[17:54] <pmichaud> correct version of parrot is 39599 (or later)

[17:55] <goksie> sorry... pmichaud .. you are correct

[17:55] <Su-Shee> pittsburgh worked perfectly fine here just now and my strange gcc problem is also gone.

[17:55] <goksie> I changed it when i could not get the 39599 working

[17:55] *** eMaX left
[17:56] <pmichaud> goksie: is the parrot directory a subdirectory of the rakudo directory?

[17:56] <goksie> yes..

[17:56] <pmichaud> what happens if you change to that directory and run  "perl ./Configure.pl"  ?

[17:56] <pmichaud> (also, what os are you running?)

[17:56] <goksie> at the ~parrot dir3, i got same error

[17:57] <goksie> Fedora core 9

[17:57] <pmichaud> ...same error?

[17:57] <goksie> yes..

[17:57] <pmichaud> "Unable to locate parrot_config"?

[17:57] <goksie> yes.. 

[17:57] <pmichaud> that's not right.

[17:57] *** ruoso left
[17:57] <pmichaud> try removing the parrot directory entirely, then run  "perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot" from the rakudo directory

[17:58] <goksie> ok.. trying that now..

[17:59] <pmichaud> I have to go for a bit -- might be back on again while at the gate

[17:59] <goksie> same error even with optimize option

[18:01] <goksie> now in the ~parrot dir3, i was able to configure successfully

[18:03] <goksie> when i run make i got leaving dir3 ~rakudo/parrot/compilers/pge \n [compilers.dummy] Error 2

[18:08] *** pmurias joined
[18:11] <goksie> i did a fresh clone and everything is okay now.

[18:11] <goksie> thanks

[18:16] *** goksie left
[18:18] <last> Okay, that's weird.  I talked to moritz_ this morning about make test failing with Pittsburgh on my Mac.

[18:19] <last> Since then I've done a number of experiments.  It also failed on my 64-bit Linux box.

[18:19] <last> Both of those were updates of existing installations, so I just tried a fresh clone.

[18:20] <last> It worked, so I figured problem solved.

[18:20] <last> But I'd made it in temp directory, and when I tried to move it to the real directory, there were hardcoded paths from the build.

[18:20] <last> No prob, I figure, I can start fresh in a clean directory with a clean clone and get it to work.

[18:21] <last> But no joy!   Exact same sequence of steps, but this time it doesn't work.

[18:23] <last> Only difference I can think of was the directory I used to build?  It works in /Users/last/tools/temp/rakudo, but not in /Users/last/tools/rakudo.

[18:23] *** Su-Shee left
[18:24] <last> I'll update my bug report later this afternoon, just wanted to get this out there to see if it sparked any ideas about what could be wrong....

[21:16] * PerlJam wonders if it's time to try padre again.

[21:16] <azawawi> PerlJam: PGE syntax highlighting is a bit not 100% correct (color-wise that is).
