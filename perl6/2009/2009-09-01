[00:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmm... how are OpenGL bindings in Perl 6? Because I got a joke project that I am sure everybody would easily get behind.

[00:10] *** kidd_ left
[00:12] <japhb> KatrinaTheLamia, the OpenGL bindings are passable for simple stuff.  The bigger problem is that Rakudo is fairly slow right now, so to get any decent speed for complex stuff (like particle systems), you need to do some inline PIR here and there.  But if you're just calling a few display lists each frame, you should be fine.

[00:21] <colomon> Hi all.  I've tracked down my Temporal.t hang, and it seems to be occurring at "$t = int($t / 60); # $t is now epoch minutes" in the test_gmtime function.  Does that ring any bells for anyone?

[00:21] <colomon> Where is int()?

[00:23] <TimToady> really should be Int()

[00:23] <TimToady> since int is a native type

[00:24] *** kst left
[00:24] <colomon> int lower-case is all over the Temporal.t test code./

[00:25] *** kst joined
[00:25] <wayland76> Well, I'd guess that was written by autarch

[00:25] <wayland76> and I'm not sure how good his p6 skills are

[00:27] *** alester joined
[00:28] <wayland76> (I'm only guessing that, but that's because he dropped by p6 and did a bunch of the Temporal stuff for us, thanks to his relevant expertise from P5)

[00:28] <colomon> What does int() do at the moment?  Is it just a misspelled Int()?

[00:29] <TimToady> it would coerce to a native type int

[00:30] <colomon> rakudo: say time.int.WHAT

[00:30] <p6eval> rakudo e00587:  ( no output )

[00:30] <TimToady> but in the case above, you're probably running into the fact that we just redefine Int / Int to return Rat

[00:31] <colomon> Yes, that's the problem, but I don't understand why: $t is supposed to be a Num.

[00:31] <TimToady> you probably want $t div= 60

[00:32] <TimToady> though that won't work if $t is Num

[00:33] <colomon> Yeah, that appears to be the issue -- sometimes it's a "real" Num, and sometimes it's an int being treated as a Num.  Or something like that.

[00:34] <TimToady> what does / 60.0 do?

[00:34] <colomon> Oh, I've got it.

[00:35] <colomon> $t = int(int($t) div 60) works just fine, and makes all tests pass.

[00:35] <colomon> rakudo: my $t = 36.5; say int($t);

[00:35] <p6eval> rakudo e00587:  ( no output )

[00:36] <colomon> rakudo: my $t = 36.5; say Int($t);

[00:52] *** japhb joined
[00:53] <pmichaud> We don't have a good way to implement postcircumfix:<( )> on the builtin types at the moment.

[00:54] <pmichaud> that makes things difficult for Int($x), Num($x), etc.

[00:55] <pmichaud> Also, the specification doesn't really provide much guidance about how we map the postcircumfix:<( )> to constructors.

[00:56] <TimToady> somehow it always ends up my fault.  :)

[00:57] <pmichaud> :)

[00:57] <pmichaud> there's a fine line between "blame" and "credit" :)

[00:59] *** FCO joined
[01:00] <pmichaud> going from what I read in S13:200...

[01:00] <pmichaud> if someone writes   Dog($spot)

[01:00] <pmichaud> and there's no postcircumfix:<( )> defined for the Dog class

[01:00] <pmichaud> then it defaults to Dog.new($spot)

[01:00] *** SmokeMachine left
[01:00] <pmichaud> and so unless there's been a single-argument version of Dog.new defined, it would fail to bind.

[01:00] <TimToady> which, of course, is nonsense

[01:01] <pmichaud> S13 is nonsense, or what I'm writing is nonsense?  ;-)

[01:01] <TimToady> I don't see any substitute for someone writing the body of the conversion

[01:01] <pmichaud> right

[01:01] <TimToady> to at least turn it into .new(value => $spot)

[01:01] <pmichaud> okay, that at least helps resolve my difficulty a bit

[01:01] <TimToady> see above for who to blame :)

[01:02] <pmichaud> well, the fallback would seemingly work if someone defined Dog.new($x), though, without needing to also define the postcircumfix:<( )> method as well.

[01:02] <pmichaud> that would seem useful.

[01:03] <TimToady> one would maybe like to get Array.new(1,2,3) to fall out of it somehow too

[01:03] <pmichaud> hmmm

[01:04] <pmichaud> well, since postcircumfix:<( )> grabs a capture, it could interpolate that capture to .new

[01:04] <pmichaud> so that  XYZ(1,2,3)  falls back to   XYZ.new(1,2,3)

[01:04] <TimToady> but it implies enough introspection into to representation to get a list of storage locations

[01:04] <TimToady> s/to/the/

[01:04] <pmichaud> oh, I think that someone still has to write the .new

[01:05] <pmichaud> (to handle the positional forms of .new)

[01:05] <pmichaud> instead of trying to auto-generate it

[01:05] <pmichaud> so if  Array has    method new (*@values)  { ... }    then perhaps Array(1,2,3)  ends up dtrt

[01:06] <TimToady> well, if one could introspect all the round holes, one could *attempt* to shove square pegs in, but it wouldn't work a lot of the time

[01:06] <TimToady> but certainly we can go for explicit until we run into combinatorics

[01:06] *** kst left
[01:07] *** kst joined
[01:07] <pmichaud> on a similar note,   should there be a   Rat.new(Num)  defined, that builds a Rat from a numeric like  1.23?

[01:08] <TimToady> I think .new guarantees a new object, whereas Rat(Num) merely guarantees that what is returned does Rat

[01:08] <TimToady> for some handwavey definition of Rat and Num

[01:08] <pmichaud> oops

[01:08] <pmichaud> I guess I should've asked about Rat.Num(...)

[01:08] <TimToady> maybe not specifically for those types

[01:08] <pmichaud> oops

[01:08] <pmichaud> I guess I should've asked about Num.Rat(...)

[01:09] <pmichaud> (argggh :-)

[01:09] <TimToady> 1.23.Rat should presumably be made to work

[01:09] <pmichaud> sure

[01:09] <TimToady> same as Rat(1.23)

[01:09] <pmichaud> and end up with 123/100 or something like that

[01:10] <TimToady> well, I'm inclined to think that 1.23 should bias towards 123/100 to begin with

[01:11] <TimToady> and the coercion to Num be facilitated where necessary

[01:11] <pmichaud> That's reasonable also, although not currently speced

[01:11] <TimToady> it's the way I've been inclining this past week :)

[01:12] <TimToady> I hate throwing away precision based on a false assumption

[01:12] <TimToady> I actually had the spec change edited in, and backed it out till I thought more about MMD

[01:13] <s1n> pmichaud: which hp do you have? i was looking at a mini

[01:13] <TimToady> possible that Num comprises both Rat and Flt (and Fix?)

[01:13] <pmichaud> I have the expensive HP -- Elitebook 2530p

[01:13] <pmichaud> Wonderful machine.  Not cheap.

[01:14] <TimToady> or Real can pun either to Rat or Num, looking at it a different way

[01:15] <lisppaste3> colomon pasted "spectest failure" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/86335

[01:15] <colomon> Does that error look familiar to anyone?

[01:15] <colomon> I vaguely remember someone mentioning it today?

[01:16] <s1n> i got approval to bring another laptop to work, hp have decent linux support (mini 1120) ?

[01:16] <s1n> and does rakudo compile reasonably quick with only 1 gig of memory?

[01:17] <pmichaud> I compiled Rakudo in a virtual machine with 768M without too much difficulty.  (On a 5-year old laptop to boot.)

[01:17] <pmichaud> Still, I'm not sure how quick a Mini would be at compiling tasks; I think they can be a little on the slow side.

[01:18] <colomon> Ah, it's the broken $_ % * thing.

[01:23] <s1n> pmichaud: btw, did you read my scrollback from yesterday to you?

[04:01] <TimToady> and I'm even one of those dense USians

[04:01] <Eevee_> aw

[04:01] <TimToady> is now Z

[04:01] <Eevee_> I know, just wondered if the old op was still valid

[04:01] <TimToady> nope

[04:01] <Eevee_> I heartily support unicode operators

[04:01] <Eevee_> $x ‚ô• 5

[04:02] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: oh, I would too... if there were a standard way to insert them, that I could explain to people to use

[04:02] <TimTom> emacs is C-x 8 < and C-x 8 >

[04:03] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: there's always ctrl-shift-u

[04:03] <Eevee_> or copy-paste from wikipedia

[04:03] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimTom now explain how that works exactly... what it does.

[04:03] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: so I could do ^+shift+u no matter where I am... and it would do what exactly

[04:04] *** Tene left
[04:04] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: ctrl-shift-u plus four hex characters inserts that unicode codepoint

[04:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> and copy and pasting from wikipedia doesn't help me really... as my clip board can only hold one item on most of my setups

[04:04] <TimToady> but then you have to know the raw codepoint in hex

[04:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: not universally...

[04:04] <Eevee_> err right.  well in gnome it does

[04:05] *** KatrinaTheLamia left
[04:05] <Eevee_> TimToady: that's what http://ian-albert.com/misc/unichart.php is for

[04:05] *** KatrinaTheLamia joined
[04:05] <TimToady> a compose key seems like the most universal thing currently

[04:05] <TimToady> well, I just use a program to grep the unicode tables, myself

[04:05] <KatrinaTheLamia> yeah... ^+shift+u seems to crash the tab I was chatting with

[04:05] <Eevee_> does windows support compose key?  I'm vaguely aware it supports dead keys

[04:05] <TimTom> hmm... the emacs bindings are actually fairly intuitive.  Who would have thought.  You can even press C-x 8 C-h for a listing

[04:06] *** kst left
[04:06] <KatrinaTheLamia> and I am using XFCE for my DE... which is close enough, that it should work if "it works all over gnome"

[04:06] <Eevee_> TimToady: actually I have a firefox bookmark keyword for searching unicode

[04:06] *** kst joined
[04:06] <KatrinaTheLamia> prolly a better solution would need to be part of freedesktop, before I'd consider it more >.>

[04:06] <TimToady> :digraph for vim's

[04:07] *** meppl left
[04:07] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: the compose key is part of X

[04:07] <Eevee_> and you can define your own compositions

[04:07] <TimToady> I've never had luck defining my own, but the built-in compose sequences are handy

[04:08] <Eevee_> TimToady: are you using scim?

[04:08] <TimToady> ¬ª√∂¬´

[04:08] <TimToady> yes, but I don't think that matters for this

[04:08] <KatrinaTheLamia> um... which key on the keyboard is the "compose" key? I mean I pressed ^+shift+u and it produced and underline u and crashed the tab I was chatting in.

[04:08] <Eevee_> it does

[04:08] <Eevee_> scim has its own compose table and ignores .Xcompose apparently

[04:08] <Eevee_> found this out recently, it was ignoring mine too

[04:08] <KatrinaTheLamia> like my chat client still operates.. just had to close that tab >.>

[04:08] <TimToady> well, that might explain why I couldn't change it :)

[04:09] <Eevee_> had to switch to uim, which is slightly more awkward  (anthy toolbar doesn't seem to autohide)

[04:09] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: you might have to pick one yourself.  right alt is the default I think?

[04:09] <TimToady> I use my right Menu key

[04:10] <Eevee_> I have right alt as compose and right super as third level chooser for historical reasons

[04:10] <TimToady> used to use right Alt on a machine without a Menu key

[04:10] <Eevee_> (i.e., there was no compose sequence for √ó and I haven't fixed that yet)

[04:10] * KatrinaTheLamia checks

[04:10] <KatrinaTheLamia> okay this keyboard _does_ have a right alt

[04:11] <Eevee_> it might be dependent on the keyboard or layout, or I might be totally wrong

[04:11] <Eevee_> and I have no idea how you'd pick such a key in xfce

[04:12] <KatrinaTheLamia> so... then how do you know it is a feature of X?

[04:12] *** tak11 left
[04:12] <Eevee_> the interwebs told me so

[04:13] <Eevee_> also custom compose sequences are defined in ~/.Xcompose

[04:13] <Eevee_> and the default list is somewhere in X shared files

[04:14] <KatrinaTheLamia> you do realise, that trying to tell people how to do this will lead only to two things: 1) Completely inconsistant code. and 2) People who think Perl 6 is needlessly complicated, and have no desire to code it, right?

[04:14] <Eevee_> that's probably why ¬• is now Z

[04:14] <TimToady> which is why we always have an ASCII story

[04:15] <TimToady> even if it's ugly

[04:15] <KatrinaTheLamia> yeah... how about just a not ugly ASCII story?

[04:15] <Eevee_> perl 6 has approximately eight trillion operators

[04:15] <TimTom> Besides, it's a good early check to make sure the parser enjoys unicode symbols

[04:15] <Eevee_> there are only so many pretty combinations of keyboard symbols

[04:15] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: lies

[04:16] <KatrinaTheLamia> there are not eight trillion operators

[04:16] <Eevee_> perhaps we need APL on Parrt

[04:16] <Eevee_> very approximately

[04:16] <KatrinaTheLamia> unless it has drastically updated since the last time the periodic table of operators has been made

[04:16] <asciiville> maybe eight trillion combinations of operators?

[04:16] <KatrinaTheLamia> also what could  you possibly do with eight trillion operators?

[04:17] <TimTom> 8 trillion things

[04:17] <KatrinaTheLamia> okay... how many words does the average person have in their vocabulary... normally about 2500. Now what happens when they try to read a word they have no clue as to what it is.

[04:17] <TimToady> std: [>>RX!%<<]()

[04:17] <p6eval> std 28153: OUTPUT¬´ok 00:02 39m‚ê§¬ª

[04:18] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: that only makes Intercal look like a more sane language than Perl6

[04:18] <Eevee_> wait wait you can reduce with hyperoperator?

[04:18] <Eevee_> well

[04:18] <TimToady> that's one of our goals :)

[04:18] <Eevee_> I guess that makes sense

[04:18] <Eevee_> that's awesome

[04:19] <asciiville> hyperoperator needs and acronym

[04:19] <KatrinaTheLamia> yeah... I thought you'd be addressing the learning curve here... not forcing people to make jephs to do a blood program

[04:19] <TimTom> They are, they just have spiffy features for those willing to learn the extra amount

[04:20] <TimTom> you can always just stick to less compact representations of code

[04:20] <TimToady> and people will just cargo-cult the rest

[04:20] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimTom: just applying occam's chainsaw here... how often, in production code, does the more spiffy versions of a language get used.

[04:20] *** molaf left
[04:20] <Eevee_> in my experience it tends to be libraries that like to use spiffy features

[04:20] <TimToady> "does get used" is the present.  We can't say how often "will get used" because we don't know yet

[04:21] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimTom: I mean, if I had to show a boss one program in Python and another in Perl 6, doing the eight trillion operator thing.. which is going to get the go ahead?

[04:21] <TimTom> If it's me... depends on whether or not someone besides me is expected to see it

[04:21] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: depends, are you using nested list comprehensions and metaclasses in your python?

[04:21] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: standard PEP-8 Python.

[04:22] <Eevee_> so "if you had to show your boss readable code and unreadable code"

[04:22] <KatrinaTheLamia> in short yes

[04:22] <jrtayloriv> KatrinaTheLamia, show your boss something which uses less idiomatic Perl 6, and the Perl 6 would probably be as readable and more concise.

[04:22] <asciiville> it may not matter if your boss only did COBOL

[04:22] <Eevee_> imo reduction operators and hyperoperators are a good thing in that they let me express an idea succinctly without translating it into less intuitive procedural code

[04:23] <Eevee_> they are nestable, sure, but that's just because perl tends to not place arbitrary restrictions

[04:23] <TimToady> we expect programmers to exercise their discretion, and we provide the tools to write very readable code

[04:23] <Eevee_> I don't think most people would want to use [¬´op¬ª] in production code

[04:23] <TimToady> we also provide the tools to nuke your feet off

[04:23] <Eevee_> but [+] <1 2 3> is reasonable

[04:23] <Eevee_> and better communicates how I actually think about the problem

[04:23] <Eevee_> "add up all this stuff"

[04:24] <KatrinaTheLamia> I dunno, it is all lovely and  all... but if I cannot use it in production code... why am I using it.

[04:24] <asciiville> say [+] < 1 2 3>

[04:24] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: your [+] <1 2 3> example is a tangent, as it is plain ASCII

[04:24] <asciiville> carp

[04:24] <TimToady> because the parts you *do* use are still more expressive than Python

[04:24] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: err but there are no unicode-only operators

[04:24] <asciiville> rakudo: say [+] <1 2 3>

[04:24] <p6eval> rakudo e00587: OUTPUT¬´6‚ê§¬ª

[04:24] <TimTom> You can use it in production, you just have to know that your audience will understand

[04:25] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: <<op>> ‚â° ¬´op¬ª

[04:25] <Eevee_> I just write the latter because I think it's more readable and obscures the operator far less

[04:25] <jrtayloriv> KatrinaTheLamia, You seem to be assuming that you will be writing production code in Perl 6 for people that don't understand Perl 6.

[04:25] <jrtayloriv> And that don't make no sense at all.

[04:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: yeah, and I am saying: there are ways to make it readable and less obscure, without going into unicode

[04:26] <Eevee_> KatrinaTheLamia: like what?

[04:26] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: well, perhaps we need to go over that as we are designing this further.

[04:27] <Eevee_> (incidentally, double angle brackets are also in iso 8859-1)

[04:27] <TimToady> most of these things do have wordy variants if you want them

[04:27] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: simply half assing the ASCII version (for no apparent reason), simply because UNICODE is available, is not the way to go

[04:27] <TimToady> reduce, map, etc

[04:27] <KatrinaTheLamia> jrtayloriv: what I am suggesting is that we make it so that Perl 6 is easier to understand for people who don't understand Perl 6... making them desire to learn it more

[04:28] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: ah, there we go

[04:28] <TimToady> how do you define "half assing"?

[04:28] <jrtayloriv> KatrinaTheLamia, It is if you want it to be.

[04:28] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: well, Eevee_ has been saying, "there is an ASCII operator you know", followed by "the ASCII operators are ugly"

[04:28] <TimToady> different people like different things

[04:29] <TimToady> and we still believe in TMTOWTDI

[04:29] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: yeah, but even with Perl, you do find, that people will generally agree that, based on the context, certain ways are better than others

[04:29] <Eevee_> so use the ASCII and disagree with me, or deal with the ugliness, or don't use hyperoperators

[04:29] <TimToady> the community is encouraged to establish style standards

[04:30] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: apart from nerding it up, what is the point of going all brainfuck with Unicode operators?

[04:30] <jrtayloriv> KatrinaTheLamia, Building limitations into the language is not the way to enforce coding standards.

[04:30] <TimTom> Science and math comunities like writing code like that

[04:30] <KatrinaTheLamia> jrtayloriv: I didn't suggest that now did I?

[04:30] <TimToady> why don't mathematicians write their proofs in English?

[04:30] <asciiville> are there really that many unicode operators beyond the hyperoperators?

[04:30] <jeekobu> Depends on the math

[04:31] <KatrinaTheLamia> asciiville: well claims have been on three trillion unicode operators. I put that to question (quoting the periodical chart) and I was told I was wrong

[04:31] <TimToady> but yes, we're mostly just making sure it's possible to talk about Unicode sanely in Perl 6

[04:31] <Eevee_> that was a very arbitrary and meaningless number

[04:31] <TimToady> you'll note that the built-in Unicode is even limited to Latin-1

[04:32] <KatrinaTheLamia> Eevee_: yeah, and I responded it was no where near that number, to which point, I was told I was wrong

[04:32] <TimToady> well, as usual, it depends

[04:33] <TimToady> as soon as you allow composability, you theoretically get lots

[04:33] <TimToady> most of which you'll never use

[04:33] <sjohnson> whhi

[04:33] <sjohnson> oops. hi

[04:34] <TimTom> hiya.  Welcome to the perl6 channel, where all your dreams come true :)

[04:34] <KatrinaTheLamia> jrtayloriv: look, I didn't say limit the language. I mean people are talking about how pretty the unicode operators are, and how bad the ASCII ones are. I am not suggesting removing the unicode ones at all. I am merely looking into was that the ASCII can look as good as the Unicode and wordy ones.

[04:34] <TimToady> but the composability is deemed to be more important than telling people what they can and cannot do

[04:34] <asciiville> i guess if you tried to express hyperoperators without unicode you'd step on the shift operators

[04:34] <sjohnson> Ôºà¬¥„ÉºÔΩÄ„ÄÄÔºâ

[04:34] <sjohnson> sad unicode

[04:34] <jrtayloriv> KatrinaTheLamia, Then I misunderstood you -- sorry.

[04:34] <TimToady> which is why they're now different from << and >>

[04:35] <TimToady> I think we're probably in violent agreement :)

[04:35] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: that happens very often I find... especially amongst geeks ~.^

[04:36] <KatrinaTheLamia> I dunno, looking at how the yen symbol has been turned into Z in instance.. we may be able to look more into that

[04:36] <KatrinaTheLamia> a better solution could prolly be put in that instance... but it is a start

[04:37] <TimTom> Well Z is the zip operator.  It makes sense

[04:37] *** justatheory left
[04:37] <KatrinaTheLamia> ah.... so how does the yen symbol fit in?

[04:37] <TimTom> ... It was pretty?

[04:37] <TimToady> it's also the path your eyes travel across the two (vertical) lists

[04:37] <KatrinaTheLamia> thank you TimToady

[04:38] <KatrinaTheLamia> see, what we need to think is more mnemonics with the symbols, rather than making the unicode look like the ascii

[04:38] <TimToady> the uen was a picture of a zipper

[04:38] <TimToady> *yen

[04:38] <TimToady> but the Z was deemed an improved metaphor

[04:38] <TimToady> as well as reminiscent of 'zip'

[04:39] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, now that you explained it as the zipper operator rather than the "yen symbol" it makes a little more sense... something like that could be put into a tutorial when explain it.

[04:40] <asciiville> ok. the yen symbol will never be the same for me now :)

[04:40] <KatrinaTheLamia> what the tutorials would need is mostly "this symbol does this, you can remember it because ..."

[04:40] <TimToady> yes, most of these things have ways of thinking about them than help you detangle them

[04:40] <TimToady> but then that could be called "knowing Perl 6" :)

[04:40] * KatrinaTheLamia googles

[04:41] <TimTom> Is there a methods operator so I could do something like 1.methods or Int.methods for explorability?

[04:42] <TimTom> You even picked my word.  I feel so smart :)

[04:43] <TimTom> I'm gonna go with you predicting the future.  Makes perl6 better

[04:43] <TimToady> anyway .^ gets you to the metaclass object

[04:44] <TimToady> kinda like ->meta in Moose

[04:44] <KatrinaTheLamia> well... I am convinced that Perl 6 is the product of an Erisian time paradox, so both of TimToady's suggestions may be right... at the same time (and neither too)

[04:45] <TimToady> "you can say that again"

[04:45] <TimToady> "that goes without saying"

[04:45] <TimToady> funny how those mean the same thing, nearly

[04:45] <jeekobu> That goes without you saying it again

[04:46] <TimToady> but I like quoting myself, since then I'm sure of the attribution

[04:46] <TimTom> Why are there integers in the return value of .^methods? Do they signify anything or are they just noise from the beta-ish state?

[04:47] <TimToady> noise, probably

[04:47] <TimTom> ... actually I don't see them on yours.  Just my computer's output

[04:52] <TimToady> probably things that are really Parrot objects behaving funny

[04:53] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: well i would likely be the same internally. As that would be how I'd do it, but how it appears like it will be implemented, will make it so it isn't as bleedingly obvious. I mean... I don't like it in other langauges when, I have to tell each entry in the array that it is another dimension of the array.

[04:53] <mr_ank> I humbly present an alternative design to the perl 6 logo: http://use.perl.org/~ank/journal/39562 (work in progress)

[04:54] <KatrinaTheLamia> in ruby, for example x = Array.new(); x[0] = Array.new(); x[1] = Array.new();... gets a little trite after a while. I kind of want to see this implemented ^.^

[04:54] <s1n> mr_ank: not bad

[04:55] <mr_ank> thanks, s1n, i'm open to suggestion/changes... especially from the TimToady etc... i only put that together in a few minutes; willing to re-do it or change it in whatever way...

[04:55] <TimToady> have you read camelia.txt?

[04:55] <mr_ank> Yes

[04:56] <mr_ank> it's in svn.pugscode, right?

[04:56] <TimToady> nod

[04:56] <KatrinaTheLamia> also, this was never competantly answered on #perl ... what is a decent CMS that is done in Perl 5?

[04:56] <TimToady> that really depends on your definition of "decent"

[04:57] <TimToady> I've heard many talks on the subject, and the mileage varies :)

[04:58] <KatrinaTheLamia> well... I kind of want to have some sort of web based admin interface, a method for multiple people to work on content, abilities for users to comment and able to extend it further via modules/plugins/extensions. Also, we can assume skinable.

[04:59] <mr_ank> TimToady: i'm willing to work on it as much as needed. I believe that the current logo has some attributes that have unintended connotations.

[04:59] <TimToady> then you believe something false, because the connotions are intended :)

[04:59] <mr_ank> Firstly, the primary colours and simple shapes used, especially the butterfly used in that way, is reminiscent of children's literature and products

[04:59] <TimToady> *connotations

[05:00] <TimToady> yes, I want it to appeal to 6 year olds

[05:00] <s1n> mr_ank: if you're into logo design, lemme pitch an idea i had but couldn't design it myself

[05:00] *** quietfanatic joined
[05:00] <KatrinaTheLamia> Also, I'll likely need to be able to sort through and browse large amounts of content. Not necessarily yet... but that is generally something every CMS should do (even though some don't)

[05:00] <s1n> mr_ank: since P6 is a rebirth of perl, why not a phoenix?

[05:00] * carlin likes that idea

[05:00] <KatrinaTheLamia> s1n: cliche... just a little

[05:00] <mr_ank> TimToady: surely you are not being serious, are you?

[05:00] <TimToady> I am deadly serious

[05:00] <mr_ank> can i quote you on that?

[05:00] <TimToady> you bet

[05:00] <mr_ank> that you want perl 6 to appeal to 6 year olds?

[05:00] <asciiville> katrina: CMS as in real CMS?

[05:01] <mr_ank> do you want perl 6 to appeal to 6 year olds primarily, as well?

[05:01] <TimToady> note that I'm not requiring every Perl 6 site to use 

[05:01] <TimToady> Camelia

[05:01] <mr_ank> no, of course not

[05:01] <TimToady> it's the Perl 6 logo, not any of its distributions

[05:01] <KatrinaTheLamia> asciiville: well, yes

[05:01] <TimToady> see Red Hat, Ubuntu, etc

[05:01] <mr_ank> right

[05:02] * s1n advises TimToady to not make a linux analogy to Perl6

[05:02] <TimToady> I haven't seen anyone laughing away Linux for using Tux

[05:02] *** mepplock left
[05:02] <TimToady> smirk

[05:02] <mr_ank> I don't see how that applies

[05:02] <KatrinaTheLamia> I dunno, I kind of prefer TimToady's logo... friendly and humourous.

[05:02] <jrtayloriv> I like butterflies. More than burning birds.

[05:02] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: Perl 6 would have camilla, where as Pugs, Rakudo, etc., are free to have their own logos.

[05:03] <asciiville> we should steer away from "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince" stuff for logo ideas :)

[05:03] <mr_ank> but it sits in perl6.org

[05:03] <s1n> i prefer the bikeshed blue, but it's just the logo for the language, not the impl

[05:03] <TimToady> so, we'll also have perl6.com, perl6.biz, perl6.info, and these can all have something else

[05:04] <TimToady> as I was mentioning earlier, we can have both Kansas and Oz

[05:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> asciiville: well, a logo should compliment a brand name, rather than replace it... other than that, I do not follow.

[05:04] <asciiville> katrina: just a bad joke on my part :)

[05:04] <s1n> TimToady: it's probably a good idea to have one banner, as to build one brand in developers' minds

[05:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> asciiville: ah, okay ^.^

[05:04] <TimToady> a1n, well, that's Camelia

[05:04] <TimToady> *s1n

[05:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> s1n: yeah, but we are allowed variations of it.

[05:04] <TimToady> unless you can come up with something I like better

[05:05] <TimToady> which will be difficult

[05:05] <mr_ank> oh

[05:05] <s1n> hah

[05:05] <TimToady> which is what the file I sent you to already says

[05:05] <s1n> well, i'm not 6, so i don't see the appeal of a butterfly :/

[05:05] <mr_ank> TimToady:  have you considered the possibility that your own taste in logos might not be good for the community at large?

[05:05] <asciiville> Embarrassed to say I did not "get" Camelia until YAPC this year until I realized it was a variant on Camel.

[05:05] <TimToady> if my taste is not good for the community at large, it's way too late

[05:05] <KatrinaTheLamia> s1n: you see a camel on a programming book... are you going to think of anything other than Perl5? No matter what appearance it is. The butterfly would be the same.

[05:06] <mr_ank> TimToady: also, have you considered that there *are* professional graphic designers around here, hoping to help

[05:06] *** TimTom left
[05:06] <TimToady> I'm professional, get over it.

[05:06] <mr_ank> TimToady: no, it's not - i'm talking about taste in logos

[05:06] <TimToady> most corporate logos have no taste whatsoever

[05:06] <mr_ank> Please, I'm pleading here.

[05:06] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: yeah... considering what I've seen, generally no matter what logo we go with, some graphic artist (prolly several) will complain

[05:07] <mr_ank> KatrinaTheLamia: that's no reason not to use one

[05:07] <TimToady> plead away, I know how to interest the next generation of programmers, and I don't care if it upsets the old geezers

[05:07] <asciiville> after the conversation today the logo could be constructed from unicode art :)

[05:07] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: I think it is fine, to be honest... and I've also had some training in graphic design too.

[05:08] <s1n> i propose Nil, the anti-logo logo

[05:08] <mr_ank> TimToady: even if the intention is to show perl 6 to children, the information in that same page is targeted at adults.

[05:08] <TimToady> so?

[05:09] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: well, lets deconstruct you logo... is that a lowercase 6 you are using?

[05:09] <TimToady> I don't buy arguments of people being offended on behalf of other people who *might* be offended

[05:09] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: so? Most adults really have no desire to go around and be adults all the time... most adults I like tend to be the ones who are more than willing to be silly

[05:09] <mr_ank> it's coherence, I couldn't care less about offending an imaginary person.

[05:09] <s1n> mr_ank: face it, we are collectively less intelligent than larry, thus we deserve to have content geared towards us created by him appear as childrens' literature because that's all our tiny brains can handle :)

[05:09] <TimToady> Camelia is quite coherent

[05:10] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: so, you are offended then?

[05:10] <asciiville> I like Camelia. She's friendly and says "code me"

[05:10] <mr_ank> not at all

[05:10] <KatrinaTheLamia> I am going to have to agree with asciiville

[05:10] <asciiville> She right?

[05:10] <mr_ank> What I mean is that the logo, the brand, marketing, etc - would work better by having a professional who can manage that. I am not that person, but I'm sure you can find it.

[05:10] <TimToady> yes, she's a she

[05:10] <KatrinaTheLamia> I'd prefer something friendly and cute. Rather than something adult, for the sake of adult

[05:10] <asciiville> whew!

[05:10] <TimToady> I alread found that person, and it's me

[05:11] <mr_ank> Respectfully, I suggest you look into you and try and think if someone else might do the job better.

[05:11] <s1n> TimToady: need a little grease to get your head through the door? :)

[05:11] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: okay, so first you say that TimToady's design isn't professional, then you say, you are not professional enough to make a design decision?

[05:11] <TimToady> s1n: :)

[05:11] <mr_ank> KatrinaTheLamia: no, i'm saying i'm not a marketing professional

[05:12] <TimToady> I am

[05:12] <mr_ank> i expect someone much better than me to handle perl

[05:12] <mr_ank> ok

[05:12] <mr_ank> TimToady: there are a number of reasons why you are not, even if you believe you are

[05:12] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: okay then. First we need to determine who the logo is aimed at. The demographic. I think TimToady has it right, where we work on modifying the logo slightly depending on the audience

[05:12] <s1n> TimToady: but marketing professionals don't even believe in their own product, they hate commercials just as we do

[05:12] <TimToady> you don't think Perl 5 got where it is entirely on its merits, do you? :)

[05:13] <mr_ank> TimToady: I think the JPL did a great job paying for it

[05:13] <mr_ank> (see, i can pick arbitrary causes too)

[05:13] <mr_ank> anyway, this is not constructive.

[05:13] <mr_ank> thank you for listening what I had to say.

[05:14] <TimToady> you're welcome

[05:14] <TimToady> sorry I'm so hardheaded on this one

[05:14] <mr_ank> no need to apologize

[05:15] <s1n> mr_ank: you had little chance in changing his mind, there were tons of responses on p6l and in the end larry just said "thanks for the input but i'm keeping what i have" heh

[05:15] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: I look at your logo, and I think: "very quick mock up for some cheap client in a company." Really, that is the first thing I think of. Even though it is a butterfly, it is exactly what every 3rd rate company would do  for a butterfly. (con't)

[05:15] <mr_ank> KatrinaTheLamia: i made it in about 5 minutes, just to foster talk, etc

[05:15] <TimToady> for good or ill, I have a stubborn streak

[05:15] <TimToady> but it's one of the reasons I'm still working on Perl 6

[05:16] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: meanwhile with Camelia, in its current state (from the context I've seen) is mostly for usages on pages, where they need to say, "hey, we are not teaching you how to code something that looks like line noise"

[05:16] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: from what TimToady has suggested, in other contexts, Camelia will appear slightly different.

[05:17] <s1n> let's see if there's a happy medium, TimToady, think you would let someone with really good graphics skills touch up Camelia (polish, not re-envision)?

[05:18] <TimToady> well, I don't really like the plastic looks very much, but for some contexts it would work

[05:18] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: on ther perl6.org page, it is mostly there to express that Perl6 is simple. Compare your logo to what TimToady did. Now ask, which makes the language not look like the horrid line noise language that people see perl as.

[05:18] <mr_ank> seriously? mine, hacked in 5 minutes

[05:19] <asciiville> A Camelia Bobblehead would set it in stone for everyone

[05:19] <mr_ank> I really have nothing positive to say about Camelia, i'm truly sorry about that.

[05:19] <TimToady> do you read comics?

[05:19] <mr_ank> Sometimes

[05:19] <TimToady> so toons can be for adults

[05:19] <mr_ank> absolutely

[05:20] <TimToady> Camelia can be a toon for aduls

[05:20] <mr_ank> things like Maus, for instance

[05:20] <mr_ank> one of the best comics ever.

[05:20] <mr_ank> consistently rated 3

[05:20] <mr_ank> #1

[05:20] <TimToady> and I think Americans can learn to tolerate "cute" from the Japanese men

[05:20] <mr_ank> sure

[05:20] <s1n> TimToady: in all fairness, modern comics are much more viceral (spelling?) than their predecessors

[05:20] <mr_ank> If you are referring to me - I'm not American, I was born in Argentina.

[05:20] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: how about cartoons from the 1980s and 1990s, that generally look kiddy.... some can contain some very adult ideas.

[05:21] <TimToady> sure, but Camelia is not supposed to be about angst

[05:21] <mr_ank> KatrinaTheLamia: from that era, the most important was probably Watchmen

[05:21] <mr_ank> It redefined the superhero genre

[05:21] *** agentzh1 joined
[05:21] <mr_ank> It's from ~1985 iirc

[05:21] <mr_ank> let's talk about art, then

[05:21] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: I'd prolly have included Earthworm Jim, Tick and Freakazoid as my favourite cartoons of that era, that could potencially present some adult ideas... just in a silly manner

[05:22] <mr_ank> i'm not against "silly manner"

[05:22] <mr_ank> ook

[05:22] <KatrinaTheLamia> Camelia is not about angst. Watchmen present a bad  picture of he state of the world. Maus presents the crap of WWII

[05:22] <mr_ank> Look

[05:22] <mr_ank> http://boring3d.com/ << i love that page

[05:22] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: maybe we need to present an silly adult form we can agree on?

[05:22] <s1n> i'm pretty sure the guy that did the Tick would put a chair for a head on camelia

[05:22] *** agentzh left
[05:23] <mr_ank> I have the complete collection of The Tick

[05:23] <KatrinaTheLamia> s1n: naw... that is limiting him too much

[05:23] <asciiville> How about Franklin, Phineas, Fat Freddy, and Fat Freddy's Cat?

[05:23] <mr_ank> I also have absolutely nothing against funny or simple or things for kids

[05:24] <mr_ank> or silly adult - that's good too

[05:24] <KatrinaTheLamia> mr_ank: well, I had the three seasons of the cartoon, and the live action series... with none of the comics though

[05:24] <KatrinaTheLamia> Franklin? I always hated that one >.>

[05:24] <asciiville> :)

[05:24] *** alester left
[05:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmm... but following this more... maybe lets pulls something from Dr. Seuss or Bearenstein Bears... Dr. Seuss was a graphic designer in WWII... I cannot remember much about Bearenstein Bears (much less how to spell it)

[05:25] <mr_ank> Dr. Seuss stuff is brilliant

[05:26] <mr_ank> I wouldn't mind having this as logo for perl 6 http://www.creativityforkids.com/ASSETS/28FB432BCDC14B18A158001B97129B6C/dr.seuss%20final.jpg

[05:26] <s1n> nintendo has long had a slogan "there is a kid turning 6 everyday". given their success, maybe we should call it Perlii and use a faceless/limbless avatar or Mario for the logo

[05:26] *** kst left
[05:27] *** kst joined
[05:27] <KatrinaTheLamia> also keep in mind, Walt Disney is famous for saying: "if I made stuff for kids, I wouldn't have succeeded"--if we follow this, we may be able to apply the Disney effect to the Perl 6 logo

[05:27] <asciiville> s1n: :)

[05:28] <TimToady> well, cat-comes-back is not quite the same as metamorphosis :)

[05:28] <s1n> KatrinaTheLamia: don't tempt me to make a dumbo joke :)

[05:28] <mr_ank> ok, now let's review: how far away do you think Camila is to Dr. Seuss?

[05:28] <mr_ank> in terms of taste and quality

[05:29] * s1n wonders what a butterfly tastes like...

[05:29] * KatrinaTheLamia grabs up the perl6.org

[05:29] <s1n> i'll be here all week folks :)

[05:29] <TimToady> I think there are a lot of grinches trying to steal Christmas :)

[05:29] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, if we really wanted to make it adult we could replace butterfly in "camelia the butterfly" for the german word for butterfly.

[05:30] <KatrinaTheLamia> seriously: translated anything into german would make it sound hardcore

[05:30] <mr_ank> btw, TimToady - how are your eyes? i remember reading about the surgery etc years ago, sounded painful

[05:31] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: looking at it... well, the wings could use a little work... the patterns don't look... clean...

[05:31] <s1n> mr_ank: ehhh, off topic?

[05:31] <asciiville> Off the subject: Is Rakudo's "setting" considered a noun or verb?

[05:31] <TimToady> had cataract surgery on both eyes since then, but that was a piece of cake compared to the transplant

[05:31] <TimToady> noun

[05:31] <pmichaud> noun

[05:31] <TimToady> they're lumpy on purpose

[05:32] <asciiville> ah! The terminology had me confused.

[05:32] <TimToady> as in the setting of a play

[05:32] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmmm, could you explain why the sixes are lumpy?

[05:32] <carlin> Here's my rough logo idea: http://theintersect.org/images/p6logo.jpg

[05:32] <TimToady> one of the many little built-in asymmetries

[05:32] <mr_ank> that will attract kids!

[05:32] <s1n> carlin: haha

[05:33] <pmichaud> we will likely change "setting" to be something else whenever Perl 6 decides what it's ultimately going to be called :)

[05:33] <mr_ank> except for the ones that prefer nintendo

[05:33] <s1n> carlin: paint it blue and ship it!!

[05:33] <KatrinaTheLamia> carlin: paint it blue, and put "free candy" on the side, and we are sold

[05:34] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: asymmetry is not normally noted for making things look cute

[05:34] *** mr_ank left
[05:34] <TimToady> it was to make the patterns look more organic

[05:34] <TimToady> like butterfly wings really are

[05:34] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: so are we going for cute.. or organic?

[05:35] <asciiville> we were kind of questioning the naming convention of "setting" at the hackathon last saturday

[05:35] <TimToady> it's supposed to look like the P6 is sort of accidental

[05:35] <s1n> or more like it was drawn with Paint? :/

[05:35] <TimToady> organic can't be cute?

[05:35] <asciiville> thinking of setting like a stage makes sense now

[05:35] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmm.. six is kind of accidental... maybe I need to look at this further

[05:35] <TimToady> actually, they are rather carefully done pairs of splines

[05:36] <s1n> KatrinaTheLamia: barking up the wrong tree

[05:36] <carlin> I still like s1n's phoenix idea, p6 could be in fire on the wings

[05:36] <TimToady> anyway, I can tell you that constant width looked bogus

[05:37] <carlin> maybe that could be rakudo's logo; a firey parrot

[05:37] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: ah in that case the sixes don't match the rest of the wings, the green arcs, and the circles... as they don't look organic

[05:37] <pmichaud> Rakudo will likely s/setting/core/

[05:37] <asciiville> pm: now that makes even more sense

[05:37] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: yeah, I could see how the constant width would look poorly.

[05:37] <pmichaud> yes; at the time we created the directory the CORE namespace wasn't yet in the spec

[05:38] <TimToady> I think the arcs and ovals can be found in nature

[05:38] <TimToady> esp the ovals

[05:38] <TimToady> the arcs are arguable

[05:38] <pmichaud> so the best we could go with was "setting" at the time, thinking that it would correspond to the SETTING pseudonamespace

[05:39] <TimToady> which is usually, but not always, CORE

[05:39] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: well, the ovals could be worked with... the arcs need something done with them

[05:39] <pmichaud> right

[05:39] <s1n> asciiville: pugs called it Prefix iirc

[05:40] <pmichaud> "prelude"

[05:40] <TimToady> prelude

[05:40] <s1n> ahh right

[05:40] <TimToady> but that's wrongish

[05:40] <TimToady> since it's more of a lexical wrapper in Perl 6

[05:40] <TimToady> the implicit loop of -n or -p goes around the user's code, not just before it

[05:40] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: yeah... work with the arcs in the wings, you'll prolly be fine.

[05:41] <TimToady> and setting was the least overloaded word we found

[05:41] <s1n> crap it late

[05:41] <KatrinaTheLamia> anyways... now I  have the urge to design an angsty version of camelia >.

[05:43] <KatrinaTheLamia> I really should work on an EWJ style one ^.^... however my scanner isn't working... and I couldn't properly mouse draw (vector or raster) the EWJ style

[05:43] <KatrinaTheLamia> pdf?

[05:43] <KatrinaTheLamia> oh dead...

[05:43] * KatrinaTheLamia runs wget on that

[05:43] <TimToady> more like grumpy, I think

[05:43] <quietfanatic> It was a real quick piece of work.

[05:44] <quietfanatic> "Cargo-cult art"

[05:44] <pmichaud> I wouldn't want to be confronted with that bug.

[05:44] <quietfanatic> I just flipped the mouth and changed one of the segments in each of the eyes to be straight.

[05:44] <TimToady> esp since she has a 3 meter wingspan

[05:44] <pmichaud> either grumpy or angry, it says "get out of my way or I'll squash you like a..."

[05:44] <TimToady> actually, she'll probably just suck your liver

[05:44] <carlin> her wings are metamorphic right? Should flare red when she's angry

[05:44] <quietfanatic> My liver is quivering.

[05:45] <TimToady> yes, she has conscious control of the colors in her wings, but not her face

[05:45] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, I am just happy she isn't going to suck the bergamont out of my spleen. Means I can trust her not to give my slack up to the evil conspirators.

[05:46] <asciiville> Angry Camelia: too funny!

[05:47] <asciiville> actually angry camelia should popup after a compiler error

[05:47] <TimToady> no, that should be sorry camelia

[05:47] <asciiville> haha

[05:47] <sjohnson> haha he looks mean

[05:47] <TimToady> she

[05:47] <sjohnson> she*

[05:48] <asciiville> are there any sorry camelias to be posted tonight?

[05:48] <TimToady> prolly not

[05:49] <TimToady> maybe after an error we should have a camelia with bruises and crumpled wings

[05:49] <quietfanatic> Aww...that'd make me feel even worse. :(

[05:49] <sjohnson> asciiville: do you listen to alphaville?

[05:49] <TimToady> and a bandaid

[05:50] <asciiville> sjohnson: actually no

[05:50] <quietfanatic> A butterfly's wings are its life.  If its wings are broken it can't live.

[05:50] <TimToady> er, Band-Aid¬Æ

[05:50] <TimToady> this one will get better

[05:50] <sjohnson> looks like Joe Camel missed his chance at being the Perl 6 mascot

[05:51] <quietfanatic> ...I guess she is magical after all.

[05:51] <TimToady> I can just hear the parents of the 6-year-old warning them not to go anywhere near that rough Perl 6 crowd...

[05:52] <TimToady> (if we had Joe Camel)

[05:52] <asciiville> the angry camelias will probably by in a B-movie on SyFy at some point

[05:53] <KatrinaTheLamia> just grabbing the camelia I did up... most to mock the idea of making her more adult

[05:53] <TimToady> I wonder how many we could fit into the sewers of LA?

[05:53] <TimToady> you could go for the Tammy Faye look

[05:54] <asciiville> tammy faye camelia?

[05:54] <asciiville> tammy faye camelia == alice cooper camelia

[05:55] <TimToady> vampire camelia

[05:57] <KatrinaTheLamia> and uploading ^.^

[05:57] <asciiville> timtoady: camelias potential is enormous

[05:57] <sjohnson> TimToady: you are probably right

[05:59] <KatrinaTheLamia> http://nimhlabs.com/assets/images/perl6/mock_camelia.jpeg << appologies for the quality... my scanner isn't working so I ended up using my camera

[06:00] <KatrinaTheLamia> (that was more meant to mock ank TBH)

[06:00] <pmichaud> reminds me of "Scream"  :)

[06:01] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, atleast I managed to resemble some form of art ^.^

[06:01] <KatrinaTheLamia> that I just did up quickly... I dunno, maybe if I put a little more effort into it, you could tell those are fishnet stockings.

[06:02] <TimToady> maybe it really was The Scream--wasn't that stolen some time ago?

[06:02] <pmichaud> yes, "The Scream" -- I got the name wrong

[06:02] <pmichaud> reportedly it was stolen, yes.

[06:02] <TimToady> and now you know why Camelia keeps her legs behind her :)

[06:02] <pmichaud> twice.

[06:02] <pmichaud> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream

[06:03] <asciiville> katrina: almost a mae west camelia

[06:03] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, this does kind of prove how much potencial Camelia does have.

[06:04] <KatrinaTheLamia> I mean, TimToady hasn't started cursing my ancestors at me drawing it yet... so that surely is a good sign

[06:04] <asciiville> that should be the next Perl 6 user project: a website that allows you to dress Camelia

[06:04] <TimToady> now you're getting silly

[06:05] <asciiville> yes, indeed

[06:05] <sjohnson> that might be a hit in japan

[06:05] <KatrinaTheLamia> naw... we could make  a dress up game for Camelia... IN PERL 6

[06:05] <KatrinaTheLamia> sjohnson: only if we subjected Camelia to tentacles.

[06:05] <sjohnson> i wonder if To Catch A Predator ever has spies in this channel

[06:05] <sjohnson> that might give Perl some worldwide coverage

[06:06] <sjohnson> "i want to dress you up like a butterfly..."

[06:06] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, it would certain cause us to get raided

[06:06] <sjohnson> "and other strange conversations..."

[06:07] <KatrinaTheLamia> I just realised something. I could mix the blush and cheek bones to make small sixes in my poor poor bastardisation of camelia.

[06:08] <TimToady> afk  # run away in fright

[06:08] <sjohnson> afk  # watching anime

[06:08] <KatrinaTheLamia> afk # chasing after TimToady with chainsaw

[06:09] <sjohnson> oops, you missed one space character there

[06:09] <KatrinaTheLamia> wait?

[06:14] * TimToady is not waiting for a chainsaw...

[06:15] <KatrinaTheLamia> but but but... it is Occam's Chainsaw... it is like Occam's Razor.. but BETTAH!

[06:16] <TimToady> I'm afraid you'll use it on my Unicodes

[06:17] * KatrinaTheLamia throws Occam's Chainsaw aside

[06:18] <KatrinaTheLamia> I am just glad nobody on this channel has tried to use unicode or ascii as a bad pickup line yet >.>

[06:19] <asciiville> give it time :)

[06:19] <TimToady> hopefully lots of time

[06:20] <carlin> this looks like a job for Character Map

[06:20] <KatrinaTheLamia> oh no...

[06:21] <carlin> ‚åÇ unicode has a house symbol, that will make things slightly easier

[06:21] <TimToady> it has better symbols than that, but I'm not going to help you

[06:24] <KatrinaTheLamia> what have I caused?

[06:24] <TimToady> we're trying to keep things appropriate for 6-year-old girls, not 13-year-old boys

[06:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> TimToady: well, we could work this into a form of Disney effect type thing.. where it is appropriate for adults and 6a girls... but 13a boys will get lost at every turn

[06:25] <TimToady> or the large number of older boys who think they're still 13 :)

[06:25] *** iblechbot joined
[06:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> ah, well... I don't fall into that demographic

[06:28] <TimToady> so I can get both "curve" and "melody" from it

[06:29] <sjohnson> ÁÇπ == tank

[06:29] <sjohnson> well, not in meaning, but it looks like a tank

[06:29] <sjohnson> reminds me of the tank on that Apple //e game Star Blazer

[06:53] <TimToady> they're supposed to be differnet

[06:53] <TimToady> *different

[06:53] <TimToady> Int / Int is now supposed to produce Rat

[06:56] <TimToady> you gotta admit, it's one letter shorter than .WHAT

[06:58] <JimmyZ_> and '/' is for Float

[06:59] <TimToady> no, div is for any type to define how it wants

[06:59] <TimToady> and / is for "real" division

[09:20] <masak> is there something else we can turn into pastel colours to further annoy them?

[09:23] <wayland76> I've been thinking we should do a vampire Camelia to pick up on the Twlight-teenage-girl-programmer demographic

[09:23] <Su-Shee> masak: some msg-ed me.

[09:24] <masak> Su-Shee: you could contrast the two groups in a blog post of yours.

[09:24] <Su-Shee> masak: and honestly.. _I_ consider "the style is gay" a compliment.. 

[09:24] <masak> it means they care, for one thing.

[09:25] <Su-Shee> masak: exactly.

[09:25] <M_o_C> Well, it certainly is  colorful after all ;)

[09:25] <wayland76> Yes, "colours bright and gay" and all that :)

[09:25] <Su-Shee> masak: and it means that we might not suit the traditional taste of manly male hetero old school techies but a more postmodern one. ;)

[09:26] <masak> big, bulky organizations elect a committee, and the committee arrive at a slick, abstract drab blob which offends no-one and touches no-one at heart. we're a bunch of scattered volunteers, not a big, bulky organization.

[09:26] <Su-Shee> masak: interestingly, at least 3 women made a connection to audreyt and contemporary gender-philosophy stuff an declared that the style and especially the butterfly reflects that...

[09:26] *** zamolxes joined
[09:27] <masak> Su-Shee: cool. I hadn't made that connection until now.

[09:27] <Su-Shee> so I personally don't see any reason to frantically adjust a design what's not final anyway... 

[09:27] <carlin> as much as I like Camelia etc. I would like an alternative before Perl 6 clothing hits ... :p

[09:28] <wayland76> Well, that link moritz_ pasted had an alternative :)

[09:28] <huf> i always found the name of the language in a nice font is better than an animal

[09:28] <huf> altho i guess that's "boring"

[09:28] <Su-Shee> and I don't care as long as the stuff is cool.. I mean, I use slackware and love it - and check their "design". ;))

[09:29] <wayland76> What kind of font is nice?  Are we talking about Linux Libertine, or one of those highly decorative ones with vines growing onit?

[09:29] <huf> fixed? i really like fixed.

[09:29] <huf> ;)

[09:29] <carlin> Slackware's "logo" isn't bad

[09:30] <wayland76> Well, if it's not broken, don't fix it :)

[09:30] <carlin> I doubt they've ever had heated flamewares over who hates/loves it though

[09:31] <Su-Shee> carlin: they pretty much don't care and do so deliberately. they simply ignore all issues which are discussed in the perl community in terms of "marketing"

[09:31] <Su-Shee> it's a total focus on the project.

[09:32] <M_o_C> wayland76: Can you give that link of moritz_ please?

[09:32] <M_o_C> Thanks

[09:33] <wayland76> Perl takes people into account :)

[09:33] <Su-Shee> so does slackware, but in an entirely different way..

[09:34] <Su-Shee> and the perl community saying "we don't care for design and marketing and focus on the projects" would have been an entirely valid option.

[09:34] <wayland76> But what would be bikeshed about then?

[09:35] <carlin> how much we don't care

[09:35] *** drbean left
[09:35] <wayland76> What, you mean "I think we should not care in a sort of mauve-green"?  :)

[09:37] *** ejs1 joined
[09:38] <carlin> vermillion? How will we market how much we don't care using vermillion?

[09:39] <masak> I just don't think mauve-green conveys how we don't care in a sufficient way.

[10:24] <wayland76> Well, I really meant, is there an *easy* way

[10:24] <wayland76> Otherwise there's no point me making a vampire camelia :)

[10:25] <M_o_C> Hrm, if it's only a color related change it should be easy since all you'd have to do is to create a new stylesheet and implement a way to switch the stylesheet...

[10:26] <M_o_C> However if you intend to change it to some wickedly complicated design it probably is a little harder.

[10:26] <M_o_C> Scratch the "little" ;)

[10:27] <wayland76> Well, colour, and logo.  And if I could change the title too, that would be good

[10:28] <M_o_C> Well, title change can't (or shouldn't, I'm not certain if it can

[10:28] <M_o_C> 't) be implemented via CSS

[10:29] <wayland76> I'm sure you can if you try hard enough, but some browsers may not support it :)

[11:06] <carlin> No

[11:06] <carlin> Not we are discussing the ability to dyanamically alter the colour of the bikeshed

[11:07] <wayland76> KatrinaTheLamia: now we're talking about multiple themes.  That's completely different than arguing over the theme :)

[11:07] <carlin> No, the channel should just be called #perl6-bikeshed

[11:07] <wayland76> jnthn: Basically, I'm hoping that the muiltiple themes thing will mean that people will do themes instead of talking about them :)

[11:07] <jnthn> ...

[11:40] <KatrinaTheLamia> M_o_C: CSS based logos generally are a pain in the ass. It would likely be easier to use some manner of CGI or ECMAscript

[11:41] <mberends> hi DanielC

[11:41] <M_o_C> Hm... But then you'd have to create a new template for each theme...

[11:41] <DanielC> o/ mberends

[11:41] <wayland76> KatrinaTheLamia: That might make it harder to create new themes though

[11:41] <jnthn> mberends: Hi! :-)

[11:41] <M_o_C> And start using a template engine...

[11:41] <mberends> hi jnthn!

[11:42] <DanielC> mberends: How is life? How is the parrot-module-lib project?

[11:42] <lisppaste3> MoC pasted "Logo to CSS transition" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/86357

[11:43] <M_o_C> That's what I came up with. I'm not sure though, wether it's abusing the a tag :)

[11:44] <KatrinaTheLamia> wayland76: M_o_C: naw.. just have the img tag itself point to a CGI file that redirects or paints the image. In the same URL that decides what style you are using, it directs the image where to go.

[11:44] <mberends> DanielC, life is good, glad to see you had a terrific honeymoon. I was waiting with parrot-module-lib for your return, and a few related developments need to be taken into account.

[11:44] * KatrinaTheLamia clicks

[11:44] <DanielC> mberends: ok

[11:45] <DanielC> mberends: So what are those developments?

[11:45] <mberends> DanielC: freezing Rakudo's bytecode is broken, so the safest thing to file is the PIR level.

[11:45] <DanielC> ok

[11:46] <mberends> DanielC: and at YAPC::EU there was a strong recommendation *not* to lose the source code

[11:46] * masak looks forward to the continuation of mberends++' and DanielC++'s work on parrot-module-lib

[11:46] <mberends> hi masak!

[11:46] <DanielC> o/ masak

[11:46] <masak> mberends, DanielC: oh hai :)

[11:46] <KatrinaTheLamia> M_o_C: yeah... that is not going to work for CSS in a lot of browsers. For one, the img tag in there already will overlay it. If you remove that, you will have some issues having the "a" appear in the first place

[11:47] <DanielC> mberends: Keeping the source code seems sensible.

[11:47] <KatrinaTheLamia> anyways... I've got to get some rest

[11:48] <mberends> DanielC: the amount of file space should not be a concern, so I was considering a change to the file format to store 3 blobs per module: source, PIR, PBC, and we switch to using the PBC when Parrot freeze works.

[11:49] <DanielC> Is it a good idea to store the source code as a blob?

[11:50] <DanielC> Would it be possible to make a directory where we keep all the packages in their original format?

[11:50] <mberends> I was hoping to have one file for all code

[11:50] <DanielC> Ok.

[11:51] <mberends> to avoid the Unicode file naming problem

[11:51] <DanielC> Is there an advantage to that? I figured that the reason to keep the source code was for backup.

[11:52] <DanielC> Also, should we be worried about file size? I don't know what the file size limit in Windows is.

[11:52] <moritz_> if your goal is a distribution system for open source software, keeping the source is kind of indisputable, no?

[11:52] <mberends> some people thought the "you're screwed" Q&A you wrote was rather funny, but the source allows you to regenerate lost metadata.

[11:53] <mberends> DanielC: you're pretty much guaranteed 2GB file size anywhere

[11:54] <DanielC> Is there a risk that installed modules might go over that if we stored source code + PIR + PBC ?

[11:54] <mberends> unlikely

[11:54] <DanielC> ok

[11:55] <DanielC> Did the other guys at the conference like the idea of a single file for everything including source code? I'm sure that you guys understand the pros and cons better than I do.

[11:56] <DanielC> So I'll trust your judgment on this.

[11:57] <DanielC> Wait... if you lose the metadata file, how are you going to find the source code? The metadata file is what tells you where each blob starts and ends...

[11:57] <masak> Hidden Markov Models? :P

[11:57] <mberends> it wasn't discussed anywhere, so it may be just my personal preference. It is the one I want to build, and use the opportunity to open the module hooks in Rakudo. If someone else wants to link a different module loader to the hooks later on, that's fine by me.

[11:59] <mberends> DanielC: good point. we may need some kind of delimiter between source, PIR and PBC records. PBC's are also strings...

[11:59] <DanielC> Unless I'm missing something, the source code only serves as a backup if it is in a separate file from the metadata and the big file with all the modules...

[12:00] <DanielC> Delimiter: ok

[12:00] <mberends> the big file is what wer'e making accessible, so it would be great if the source could live there.

[12:00] *** kst left
[12:01] *** kst joined
[12:01] <DanielC> In general a module is composed of several source code files... Do you think that might present a problem? (ie. we'll lose that organization in the big file).

[12:03] <DanielC> Or maybe I'm wrong and a module is always just one file.

[12:03] <mberends> Is a module not just 1 file? I know there's a module declaration distinct from package. I'd settle for a 1:1 mapping module:file initially.

[12:03] <DanielC> I'm probably wrong.

[12:03] <DanielC> If it's just one file, that makes things easier.

[12:03] <DanielC> Can a module have binary blobs like images?

[12:03] <mberends> I don't remember either :)

[12:04] <moritz_> mberends: that's the choice of the author

[12:04] <moritz_> a file can contain multiple module declarations

[12:04] <DanielC> moritz_: Can a module declaration cover two files?

[12:04] <DanielC> e.g. through some sort of "include" command?

[12:05] <moritz_> well, you can augment classes (and maybe modules) in other files

[12:05] <moritz_> and you can always read and eval files, though that's discouraged

[12:06] <DanielC> This might make the module library a bit more tricky.

[12:06] <masak> I say make the design simple for now.

[12:06] <masak> one-file-one-module is one of those 99% things.

[12:06] <DanielC> masak: Do you think it's ok to assume a 1-to-1 map between files and modules?

[12:06] <masak> I do.

[12:07] <DanielC> ok

[12:07] <masak> there are examples of cases where both directions break...

[12:07] <masak> ...but I don't think they merit consideration in the design.

[12:07] <DanielC> How about binary blobs like images? Can modules have those?

[12:07] <masak> that's not for me to say. :) I only deal in text.

[12:09] <moritz_> DanielC: distributions might contain those

[12:09] <DanielC> mberends: If we are going to store the source code in the Big File, we might as well also store a second copy of the metadata. So each module would be represented as <delimiter> + <metadata> + <source> + <PIR> + <PBC>

[12:10] <DanielC> The <metadata> tells you the location of <source>, <PIR> and <PBC>.

[12:10] <DanielC> moritz_: Ok. Then we'll have to keep that in mind and find a way to store those too.

[12:10] <mberends> DanielC: an excellent idea!

[12:11] <DanielC> :-D

[12:11] <mberends> but that's an easy change. the area that need the most work is interpretation of wildcard module specifiers

[12:11] <DanielC> ok

[12:11] <moritz_> what kind of blobs are you folks talking about? tar archives?

[12:11] <mberends> eg (from S11) use Dog:ver(v1.2.1..^v1.3);

[12:12] <mberends> moritz_: the frozen or stringified compiled module PBC code

[12:13] <mberends> ugh, what an unwieldy way to say that

[12:14] <moritz_> DanielC's proposal read as if there were mutliple logical files in a single blob

[12:15] <mberends> in some sense there would be

[12:15] <mberends> a module lib maintenance tool would have to do a kind of concatenate

[12:16] <moritz_> that's why I asked about tar

[12:16] <DanielC> moritz_: For the parrot-module-lib we were talking about storing all the modules inside a single big huge file. Then using a metadata file to locate the start and end of each of the original files in the distribution.

[12:16] <moritz_> it does such concatenation already

[12:16] <mberends> we discussed tar but shrank away from the exact file layout requirements

[12:16] <DanielC> moritz_: The problem with that is that if you lose the metadata file, the Big file becomes useless.

[12:17] <moritz_> that's why you pack the meta data into the Big File

[12:17] <moritz_> and end up with... a typical archive :-)

[12:17] <DanielC> moritz_: And that leads into what we are talking about right now. :-)

[12:17] <mberends> tar files have Unix specific fields

[12:17] *** drbean joined
[12:18] <DanielC> moritz_: So now we are talking about storing both metadata and the original source code in the Big File.

[12:18] <moritz_> hey, you could use AVI as a container file format :-)

[12:19] <moritz_> that can store meta data and blobs

[12:19] <moritz_> (ok, I'm not entirely serious here)

[12:19] <DanielC> moritz_: The idea of a separate metadata file is to speed up data retrieval. The metadata file is small and fast to read and it tells you the byte offsets where you can find the stuff you need. So you can just do a disk seek which is fast and cheap.

[12:20] <mberends> to avoid repetition, the design so far is here: http://www.gitorious.org/parrot-module-lib/main/trees/master

[12:20] <DanielC> So, having the metadata inside the Big File is meant as a backup.

[12:21] <mberends> the metadata will be very useful for arbitrary utilities

[13:08] <masak> always. :)

[13:09] <mberends> :) I would like to keep the project download directories separate from .ecosystem, and use 'make install' to selectively copy files across. is that your expectation?

[13:10] <moritz_> that's pretty much what CPAN.pm does

[13:10] <mberends> indeed

[13:10] <moritz_> (except with a different name)

[13:10] <moritz_> and I think that's sane

[13:10] <ruz_> pmurias: are you interested in something particular?

[13:10] <masak> mberends: yes, that is my expectation.

[13:11] <masak> mberends: at the very least, there must be some distinction between modules that aborted during installation, and modules that succeeded.

[13:12] <mberends> ok, and 'make test' also verifies useable code.

[13:12] <mberends> ok, then every project needs to 'make install' proto's way, implying a $ECOSYSTEM target directory

[13:12] <masak> aye.

[13:12] <masak> basically, it means that we'll have one more step than we do now.

[13:13] <masak> right now 'install' means 'download'.

[13:13] <mberends> so this change will also break all projects until they respect $ECOSYSTEM

[13:29] <dakkar> do Perl 6 "foreach" loops return the list of results from the block?

[13:29] <moritz_> I usually also prefer for-loops if they are nested

[13:30] <masak> dakkar: aye.

[13:30] <moritz_> dakkar: it should. It doesn't yet in Rakudo

[13:30] <masak> that's another reason I didn't use them. :)

[13:30] <dakkar> uh. so one of map/foreach can be a macro defined in terms of the other one

[13:30] <masak> I also use 'is also' everywhere. and an unnecessary couple of assignments in BUILD.

[13:31] <dakkar> I thought that map was more like gather { foreach { take ... } }

[13:31] <dakkar> i.e. that foreach did not return anything useful

[13:31] <masak> dakkar: 'foreach' is spelled 'for' in Perl 6, btw.

[13:31] <masak> dakkar: but no, they're semantically identical. except that for-loops aren't expressions by default, so you have to 'do' them.

[13:32] <dakkar> oh. ok.

[13:33] <moritz_> but the error mesage is less than awesome

[13:33] <PerlJam> dakkar: he's showing that "map" is a shortcut for "do for"  :)

[13:33] <dakkar> right

[13:33] <moritz_> "please use whitespace instead of parens" - which parens did I use?

[13:33] <masak> TimToady: LTA error above! ^

[13:34] <pmichaud> wow, very interesting backscroll this morning :)

[13:34] <masak> we aim to please. :)

[13:35] * masak wonders how the synonymity between 'do for' and 'map' squares with the '-> {}' special case we discussed after YAPC::EU

[13:35] <masak> IIRC, pmichaud opined that a '-> {}' block after a for-loop, if it wasn't a compile-time error, should consume elements. I opined that it shouldn't.

[13:36] <dakkar> I don't remember your rationale (and I was there‚Ä¶)

[13:36] <pmichaud> (rats):   I find it a little jarring that   say 1.2 + 3.4;  will end up producing "23/5".

[13:36] <masak> my rationale is simple: consume nothing is what it says it does. :)

[13:37] <moritz_> pmichaud: aye

[13:37] <moritz_> me too

[13:37] <moritz_> I never liked that in pugs

[13:37] <pugs_svn> r28156 | mberends++ | [Temporal.t] replace soon-to-be-deprecated int() with floor() 

[13:37] <dakkar> masak: yes, perfectly rational. my take was "consume nothing, and give a big warning"

[13:38] <moritz_> I always have to ask it a second time to get a result with which I can work

[13:38] <masak> a warning would perhaps be fine. unless there's a legitimate use for that idiom.

[13:38] <jnthn> Why would 1.2 + 3.4 produce a rat? Does 1.2 not give a Num? :-/

[13:38] <pmichaud> that's not the current thinking

[13:38] <pmichaud> the current thinking is that 1.2 would become 6/5

[13:38] <jnthn> ...

[13:39] <masak> afk &

[13:39] <moritz_> well, the current thinking, but the spec still says Num, no?

[13:39] <jnthn> .oO( sometimes I'd rather there were less thinking )

[13:39] <pmichaud> the spec is largely silent

[13:39] <pmichaud> there's one paragraph that implies it's a Num

[13:39] <moritz_> well, the test suite then.

[13:39] <jnthn> I thought you'd have to ask for a rat?

[13:39] <jnthn> e.g. write 6/5 if that's what you wanted...

[13:39] <pmichaud> well, we've seen how the test suite can change quickly....    infix:</>  versus infix:<div>  :)

[13:40] <jnthn> div is integer division, no?

[13:40] <pmichaud> when given integers

[13:40] <jnthn> And infix:</> ?

[13:40] <pmichaud> is "numeric division"

[13:41] <pmurias> ruz_: does tisql have any docs?

[13:41] <jnthn> *nod*

[13:41] <jnthn> And new Rat(3,4) is the way to make a rational?

[13:41] <jnthn> erm

[13:41] <jnthn> Rat.new(3,4)

[13:41] <pmichaud> 3/4  works

[13:41] <moritz_> 3 / 4 is a Rat

[13:41] <moritz_> as an operator

[13:41] <moritz_> and 3/4 is a literal

[13:41] <moritz_> 3.0 / 4 is a Num

[13:41] <moritz_> (in my thinking)

[13:42] <jnthn> 3 / 4 and 3/4 would parse differently, then?

[13:42] <pmichaud> yes

[13:42] * PerlJam wonders when fortran started sneaking into perl

[13:42] <jnthn> What about $x/$y and $x / $y ?

[13:42] <pmichaud> in STD.pm, they already do.

[13:42] <pmichaud> $x/$y is always a infix:<div>

[13:42] <pmichaud> sorry, infxi;</>

[13:42] <jnthn> OK

[13:42] <pmichaud> sorry, infix:</>

[13:42] <jnthn> I think I can cope with that.

[13:42] <jnthn> But 3.4 becoming a Rat feels...odd.

[13:42] <pmichaud> in particular,   +"3/4"  produces a Rat

[13:43] <moritz_> but I don't see much sense in the 3/4 special case anymore

[13:43] <pmichaud> and +"4+5i" produces a Complex

[13:43] <moritz_> since it produces a Rat anyway

[13:43] <jnthn> At least, not without a declaration in a use statement or something saying "I want Rat by default" or so.

[13:43] <jnthn> I think otherwise it's going to be rather surprising...

[13:43] <jnthn> As in, too surprising.

[13:44] <pmichaud> on the plus side -- the recent spec changes that TimToady++ made to contextual variables means we can haz context vars real soon.  Like possibly even today.

[13:46] <diakopter> how recent were those dynamic scoped vars changes?

[13:46] * jnthn didn't see 'em.

[13:46] <pmichaud> yesterday

[13:46] <diakopter> (looking for diff/url)

[13:46] <diakopter> oh

[13:46] <pmichaud> essentially:    my $var is context<rw> = 4;   is now    my $*var = 4;

[13:46] <moritz_> mberends: btw we'll soon have a "div' operator that does integer division, so you can get rid of most of the floor() calls anyway

[13:47] <diakopter> ok. marking it in the name makes it much easier to implement.

[13:47] <ruz_> pmurias: doc/tisql/

[13:48] <colomon> moritz_: I'm back and ready to work on this thing a bit.

[13:48] <dakkar> wasn't '*' the twigil for globals? (I keep getting behind on the specs)

[13:49] <dakkar> pmichaud: did we lose direct access to globals, or something replaced it?

[13:50] <mberends> colomon: the floor() change was minor, mainly to help you get away from int() problems reported earlier

[13:50] <colomon> mberends: I already had a work-around, but I'm sure your way is much cleaner.

[13:56] <pmichaud> looks wrong to me.

[13:56] *** iblechbot left
[13:57] <jnthn> pmichaud: Parrot plans to put those in a Hash, apart from it would appear that this allows one thingy per name.

[13:57] <jnthn> pmichaud: And also, lose the ordering.

[13:57] <pmichaud> I've said repeatedly "that's wrong" but allison++ doesn't seem to notice

[13:57] <jnthn> *sigh*

[13:57] <pmichaud> I want to be able to access the calling arguments directly, not intermediated through some other control structure

[13:58] <pmichaud> If a CallSignature ends up creating a Hash for every subroutine call, we're hosed.

[13:58] <jnthn> Well, in some senses we do need a common structure to get at them from, whether they originated from PIR or C or whatever.

[13:59] <pmichaud> the current implementation doesn't require putting the arguments into a hash

[13:59] <pmichaud> I don't see why CallSignature needs to do that

[13:59] <jnthn> That is, you'd rather see that those were just sequences of name, value, name, value, etc?

[13:59] <pmichaud> I'd like them to end up being Parcels

[13:59] <jnthn> heh

[14:00] <pmichaud> (yes, name, value, name, value)

[14:00] *** PacoLinux joined
[14:00] <jnthn> I think allison is rather keen on array of positionals + hash of nameds.

[14:00] <pmichaud> right now in Parrot I think I can do:     foo('a' => 3, 'a' => 4)

[14:00] <jnthn> You can

[14:00] <jnthn> However, it'll ignore the 3

[14:00] <jnthn> I guess.

[14:00] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[14:00] <jnthn> Or at least, the binder will bind the 3 to a, and then re-bind the 4 to a.

[14:01] <pmichaud> right, but the 'a' => 3 argument still appears in the calling arguments list

[14:01] <moritz_> rakudo: sub foo(*%a) { }; foo(a => 3, a => 4)

[14:01] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856:  ( no output )

[14:01] <moritz_> rakudo: sub foo(*%a) { say %a.perl }; foo(a => 3, a => 4)

[14:01] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´{"a" => 4}‚ê§¬ª

[14:01] <jnthn> pmichaud: Right.

[14:01] <pmichaud> and a custom get_params opcode would be able to get at the calling argument if wanted

[14:01] <jnthn> *nod*

[14:02] <pmichaud> anyway, here's my (not well thought out) take

[14:02] <pmichaud> at this stage, I'm not sure I want to throw a lot of issues at allison; I think she'll just deflect them

[14:02] <pmichaud> so I'd rather see *something* land in a state where we can start to fix it, rather than try to point out all of the problems up front (and delay any sort of landing any further)

[14:03] <jnthn> Aye.

[14:03] <colomon> rakudo: say 16 ** 4

[14:03] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´65536‚ê§¬ª

[14:04] <pmichaud> i.e., the "everything into a hash" isn't what we'll ultimately need, but it's pretty close to what Parrot is presently providing

[14:04] <jnthn> If the Hash was replaced by a second array, that we knew was of the form "name, value, name, value, etc..." then we'd be fine.

[14:04] <pmichaud> we can probably make that case to allison, yes.

[14:04] <jnthn> So in that sense, it could be a relatively small change afterwards, I agree.

[14:04] <cognominal_> what is a :my ?

[14:05] <pmichaud> istr there's also been some discussion about changing Perl 6's interpretation of multiple-same-named-arguments

[14:05] <dakkar> cognominal_: variable declaration inside a regex

[14:05] <pmichaud> so, it's all enough in flux that I'll wait for a few other pieces to land

[14:05] <cognominal_> I have seen that in STD but not in the specs

[14:06] <jnthn> Sure, I'm just trying to get a sense of overall direction, and know how much I need to worry about various things.

[14:06] <moritz_> cognominal_: aye, it needs more specs

[14:06] <cognominal_> why and how  should "my" be any different in rules?

[14:07] <jnthn> Basically, so long as Parrot doesn't document that "it's a hash under the hood", we're likely fine to be able to change as needed later.

[14:07] <pmichaud> I think we'll be able to get it changed no matter what happens :)

[14:08] <PerlJam> cognominal_: what do you mean?

[14:08] *** ejs1 left
[14:08] <jnthn> True, but having to argue against giving something we didn't want in the first place a deprecation cycle would be silly.

[14:09] <pmichaud> hopefully we'll have at least 2 months to make that argument before the deprecation cycle hits

[14:09] <jnthn> But I agree, it's probably close enough that we can just say "land it and we'll clean up afterwards".

[14:22] <masak> ah. here's a better way to highlight the perceived inconsistency of different conversion methods at present: if I do $obj.say, the $obj.Str method is implicitly called. however, if I do ?$obj or $obj ?? 'foo' !! 'bar', the $obj.Bool method is _not_ called, as one might perhaps generalizingly think. instead, the $obj.true method is called.

[14:32] <masak> not only .true and .Bool, but also .list and .List, I'd say.

[14:32] <masak> and what does .int do that .Int doesn't?

[14:32] <pmichaud> I know the answer to the last one

[14:32] <pmichaud> .int -> coerce to native int

[14:35] <masak> eliminate .true and be done with it.

[14:35] <masak> also, eliminate .list

[14:36] <masak> keep .int, since it actually does another type of conversion.

[14:36] <pmichaud> I'm not sure that eliminating .list is right

[14:36] <pmichaud> .list is what we get when we put something into list context

[14:36] <pmichaud> but what it returns is not necessarily a List

[16:00] <jnthn> TimToady: About?

[16:00] <TimToady> I don't know what I'm about

[16:01] <masak> a.k.a "if you think Camelia is the most exciting news we have for you, boy do we have news for you" :)

[16:01] <jnthn> I wish English had a particle indicating I only expected a yes/no answer. ;-)

[16:01] <jnthn> TimToady: I'm looking at unpacking in S06.

[16:01] <masak> "about, eh?"

[16:01] <TimToady> actually I was about to take a shower :)

[16:01] <jnthn> If we consider:

[16:01] <jnthn> oh

[16:01] <TimToady> go ahead

[16:01] <jnthn> ok

[16:01] <jnthn> sub quicksort ([$pivot, *@data], $reverse?, $inplace?) {

[16:02] <jnthn> }

[16:02] <TimToady> yes, one mandatory, to optional

[16:02] *** cotto joined
[16:02] <jnthn> Here, we can basically make a temporary array @worreva and then use it like |@worreva and bind against :($pivot, *@data)

[16:02] <jnthn> Which works out quite nicely.

[16:03] <TimToady> *two

[16:03] <jnthn> That is, we can just treat what's inside [...] as a nested signature. Does this fix so far with what you had in mind?

[16:03] <TimToady> yes

[16:03] <jnthn> OK, good. :-) So...another one:

[16:03] <jnthn> sub traverse ( BinTree $top ( $left, $right ) ) {

[16:03] <jnthn> }

[16:03] <TimToady> [] just emphasizes that you're thinking of it as a list

[16:04] <jnthn> So in here, I guess it's like we have a signature :( $left, $right )

[16:04] <TimToady> which is applied as an additonal constraint

[16:04] <jnthn> *nod*

[16:05] <jnthn> My question in this second example is, what happens if BinTree had, say, a .middle attribute too?

[16:05] <jnthn> That is, does this signature have some implicit slurpy in it?

[16:05] <jnthn> Or is the way we bind somehow different?

[16:06] <TimToady> I can argue that one both ways

[16:06] <jnthn> Because S06 seems to suggest that here, you'd unpack $left and $right (I guess :(:$left, :$right) woulda done the same) but it'd not matter if there were any other things that oculd be unpacked.

[16:06] <TimToady> does one way make more sense to you?

[16:06] <jnthn> I'd generally argue in the direction of consistency.

[16:06] <jnthn> But we're already consistently inconsistent. :-)

[16:07] <TimToady> well, yes, consistent with what?

[16:07] <jnthn> (e.g. a method will by default get a *%_ unless it has a *%something)

[16:07] <TimToady> but we can't assume *%_ in more than one subsig

[16:07] *** ruoso left
[16:07] <jnthn> I'm not sure I follow why?

[16:08] <TimToady> name conflict

[16:08] <TimToady> like sub foo ($a, $a)

[16:08] <TimToady> so I think if we want generic code we should probably force people to write their own *%foo *%bar

[16:09] <jnthn> OK, so when you have a subsignature, the binding of its parent signature is dependent on the binding of the subsignature in some deeper way?

[16:09] <jnthn> That is, other than "here is the hash/array/object that we need to unpack, use this to unpack it")?

[16:09] <TimToady> well, the overall binding fails if the subbinding fails

[16:09] <jnthn> Right, that makes sense.

[16:09] <jnthn> Actually, the one that is really confusing me is:

[16:10] <jnthn>     multi traverse ( NAry $top ( :kids [$eldest, *@siblings] ) ) {

[16:10] <jnthn> And this call to it

[16:10] <jnthn> traverse(:kids(@siblings));  # (binds @siblings to $top)

[16:10] <TimToady> that seems kinda bogus

[16:10] <jnthn> That is, binding can't just say "OK, I have an NAry, now I hand it off to the subsignature to unpack"

[16:11] <jnthn> I'd really love it to be.

[16:11] <TimToady> but I'll have to think about it more

[16:11] <jnthn> OK, that's fine, I'm not in a hurry.

[16:11] <pmichaud> TimToady: let us know when you start running out of things to be thinking about :)

[16:11] *** kidd_ left
[16:12] <jnthn> Anyway, that and the "do you have to write *%foo in there" are probably my most pressing questions.

[16:12] <TimToady> rub it in, why dontcha

[16:12] <jnthn> I'd really kinda like it if the binding of a signature could treat a sub-signature as a black box.

[16:12] <TimToady> I'd say yes on *%foo for now

[16:12] <pmichaud> TimToady: I just want to make sure you know how much we value your input :) :)

[16:12] <jnthn> OK

[16:13] <TimToady> the underlying question is the extent to which the subsignature can coerce different kinds of objects to look like a Capture

[16:13] <jnthn> I can see your point on the naming conflict with *%_ by the way - was a tad slow there. :-)

[16:13] <jnthn> Well, yes.

[16:13] <jnthn> And with a hash and an array that's not so hard.

[16:13] *** kidd_ joined
[16:13] <jnthn> Because we already define that.

[16:13] <jnthn> But for an object it's a bit more interesting.

[16:14] <TimToady> maybe only for types that define a method defining coercion to Capture

[16:14] <jnthn> Do you see |%hash as being like Capture(%hash) and thus %hash.Capture, BTW?

[16:14] <TimToady> does that sound sane?

[16:15] <jnthn> Well, hmm

[16:15] <TimToady> are you meaning | as rvalue?

[16:15] <jnthn> It'd be nice if you could unpack without having to worry about writing said coercion.

[16:15] <TimToady> or as decl?

[16:15] <jnthn> The first

[16:15] <jnthn> foo(|%foo)

[16:15] <jnthn> erm, too much foo :-)

[16:16] <jnthn> (I know it means something different inside a signature.)

[16:16] <jnthn> I think coerce to capture sounds like a clean design overall though.

[16:16] <TimToady> not sure, might be mediated through Parcel first before turning into Capture, but I could be wrong

[16:17] <jnthn> I've not really grokked the relationship between those yet.

[16:17] <TimToady> well, the Capture coercion might be deducable for some types

[16:17] <TimToady> but we'll have to define that, if so

[16:17] <jnthn> I figure that you can only for attributes unpack things with accessors anyway, otherwise encapsulation is broken.

[16:17] <TimToady> for now we can say there has to be an explicit Capture coercion, or fail

[16:17] <jnthn> We can certainly define it in terms of introspection.

[16:18] <TimToady> yes, esp with mapping attrnames to named params

[16:18] <jnthn> Aye

[16:18] <TimToady> some amount of dwim might be useful there

[16:18] <jnthn> Well, plus it's something we can just define in Object (or Any).

[16:18] *** KyleHa joined
[16:18] <jnthn> And can define in terms of primitives we already have.

[16:18] <TimToady> but I'll not be disappointed if it's not in 6.0.0

[16:19] <TimToady> mostly just need to have a story on tree matching patterns

[16:19] <jnthn> I'm going to be dealing with unpacking when I re-do signatures, which will be Oct/Nov. :-)

[16:19] <jnthn> Thus why I'm starting to think about this now.

[16:19] <TimToady> okay.  I'm starting to think about taking a shower. :)

[16:19] <jnthn> :-)

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: 39c3f4b | (Solomon Foster)++ |  (5 files):

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: infix:</>(Int, Int) creates a Rat, infix:<div>(Int, Int) an Int, as per latest S03

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: Also fix depending code, namely Temporal.pm

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: Fix Rat.perl to return "N/M" rather than "Rat.new(N,M)".

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: Switch GCD routine to use % instead of -, for a vast performance increase on widely mismatched numbers. Add Rat * Int, Int * Rat, Rat / Int, and Int / Rat overloads.

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: Patch mostly by colomon++, with some minor contributions and cleanups by moritz

[18:21] <dalek> rakudo: See RT #68898 for discussion.

[18:22] <pugs_svn> r28161 | moritz++ | [t/spec] correct meaning of infix:<div> and infix:</>. Patch courtesy (mostly) by colomon++ 

[18:23] <moritz_> I think it's a good sign that these changes made Temporal.pm more elegant ;-)

[18:23] *** rindolf joined
[18:23] <rindolf> Hi all.

[18:24] <pmichaud> I don't think that infix:<div> and infix:<mod> need to be added to gen_metaop_pir.pl in order to work

[18:24] <pmichaud> I might be mistaken, but I think that once an operator is in the setting the metaops are generated automagically for them.

[18:24] <colomon> moritz_: Yes, that's always a good sign.

[18:24] <moritz_> pmichaud: without it >>div<< gave parse errors

[18:24] <pmichaud> although the 0-argument forms might not be

[18:24] *** frederico joined
[18:24] <pmichaud> okay, I'll look into that.

[18:25] <colomon> The unicode form of >>div<< worked, however, which definitely had me puzzled.

[18:25] <pmichaud> right, that means there's a bug in the gen_hyperop subroutine in Rakudo then

[18:28] * moritz_ is curious how much fallout his latest patch will cause in various apps

[18:28] <moritz_> s/his/our/

[18:29] <colomon> moritz_: If anything doesn't work, blame TimToady.  ;)

[18:32] <moritz_> (notice the y axis labels on the left)

[18:33] <colomon> :)

[18:34] <pmichaud> I don't mind if .Str omits the /1 for cases where the denominator is 1

[18:34] <moritz_> that's a good idea, actually

[18:34] <colomon> I'd be happy to make that change as soon as I've got the new build up and running.

[18:35] <colomon> Agreed that it is a good idea.

[18:37] <colomon> Errr... but only for .Str, right?  .perl should still be "N/1".

[18:38] <pmichaud> correct

[18:38] <pmichaud> we want to preserve Rat status with .perl

[18:39] *** Tene joined
[18:41] *** ispy_1 joined
[18:41] *** FCO joined
[18:41] <moritz_> I wouldn't be opposed to makeing .Str the equivalent of .Num.Str

[18:42] <moritz_> that would imply the least breakage for existing code

[18:42] <pmichaud> I want to know what the spec will say on the topic, and do that.

[18:42] <moritz_> although it looks hackis

[18:42] <moritz_> h

[18:43] <pmichaud> aha

[18:43] <pmichaud> the problem with >>div<< versus ¬ªdiv¬´ appears to have something to do with prior invocations of the hyperop

[18:44] <pmichaud> rakudo: multi sub infix:<xyz>($a,$b) { $a+$b };  say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6);  say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6);

[18:44] <TimToady> I think Str should be .Num.Str

[18:45] <TimToady> use .perl to get the rat back out

[18:45] <jnthn> pmichaud: huh?! :-/

[18:45] * jnthn wonders what on earth could cause a bug like that

[18:45] <pmichaud> I don't know either

[18:45] <colomon> rakudo: multi sub infix:<xyz>($a,$b) { $a+$b };  say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6);

[18:45] <jnthn> rakudo: multi sub infix:<xyz>($a,$b) { $a+$b }; sub foo{ say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6);  say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6); }; say "alive"

[18:46] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´579‚ê§¬ª

[18:46] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´alive‚ê§¬ª

[18:46] <pmichaud> TimToady: so   ~(1/3)  would output  "0.333333" ?

[18:46] <jnthn> Ah, certainly not a parse error then.

[18:46] <jnthn> :-/

[18:46] <frettled> phew :)

[18:46] <TimToady> yes, I don't think people want to see rats accidentally :)

[18:46] <pmichaud> jnthn: no, it's an invocation error.  in my earlier example it did execute once

[18:47] <moritz_> TimToady: ok, I'll implement that.

[18:47] <pmichaud> it's only the second invocation that fails

[18:47] <jnthn> pmichaud: ah, yes, I missed that

[18:47] <TimToady> and in the case of /10 it comes out exact anyway

[18:47] <jnthn> epic wtf

[18:47] <colomon> moritz_: It will break many (all?) of the rat.t tests, I think.

[18:47] <pmichaud> colomon: I would hope not

[18:47] * pmichaud checks rat.t

[18:47] <frettled> TimToady: there's (almost) too much -Ofun with rats.

[18:47] <moritz_> colomon: I'll take a look. If it does, the tests are not very good

[18:48] <moritz_> ui

[18:48] <pmichaud> oh yes, the tests are testing for strings

[18:48] <colomon> pmichaud: Tests are based on .Str being a fraction, I think.

[18:48] <TimToady> well, that's bad, I think, from a usability point of view

[18:48] <colomon> I mean, easy enough to switch to the .perl form for them.

[18:48] <pmichaud> colomon: it depends on what aspect you're testing

[18:48] <moritz_> rakudo: say Rat.new(2, 3) == 2 / 3

[18:48] <p6eval> rakudo 4c0856: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[18:48] <pmichaud> if you're testing stringification, you should test for strings

[18:48] <pmichaud> if you're testing .perl, you test .perl

[18:48] <moritz_> colomon: beware, the .perl function is not canonical

[18:49] <pmichaud> so the real question is.... what is the test attempting to test?

[18:49] <moritz_> for example "Rat.new(2, 3)" is an allowed outcome

[18:49] <frettled> rakudo: multi sub infix:<xyz>($a,$b) { $a+$b };  say (1,2,3) >>xyz<< (4,5,6); say (1,2,3) ¬ªxyz¬´ (4,5,6);

[18:49] <frettled> aha

[18:49] <frettled> rakudo: multi sub infix:<xyz>($a,$b) { $a+$b };  say (1,2,3) ¬ªxyz¬´ (4,5,6); say (1,2,3) ¬ªxyz¬´ (4,5,6);

[18:49] *** sharada left
[18:49] <TimToady> (2/3).nd returns 2 elems maybe?

[18:49] *** sharada joined
[18:50] <frettled> aha¬≤

[18:50] <pmichaud> ".nd"  reminds me a bit of :nd

[18:50] <TimToady> was thinking more of .kv

[18:50] <pmichaud> right

[18:50] <colomon> You can certainly test that the numerator and denominator are correct.

[18:50] <colomon> But that's a lot more verbose, for sure...

[18:50] <pmichaud> I first saw it as  (2).nd

[18:51] <TimToady> so combining .nu and .de would give use .nude

[18:51] <frettled>  /o\

[18:51] <jnthn> want

[18:51] <jnthn> ;-)

[18:51] <frettled> Nude Klingon Perl 6

[18:52] <frettled> I see a talk coming up.

[18:52] <TimToady> I think /o\ looks like an orz head-on

[18:52] <frettled> expn orz?

[18:52] <pmichaud> here it looks a bit like a lamp shade

[18:52] <TimToady> it doesn't expn

[18:52] <TimToady> it's a pic

[18:52] <pmichaud> or like someone has put his hands over his head

[18:52] <frettled> pmichaud++

[18:53] <TimToady> orz is a guy bowing down to the left and banging head on floor

[18:53] <pmichaud> I'd be find with Rat.nd for now

[18:53] <pmichaud> *fine

[18:54] <colomon> Do we have == for Rat yet?

[18:54] <moritz_> rakudo: say 2/3 == 4/6

[18:54] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[18:54] <frettled> TimToady: ah, like _/\o

[18:55] <colomon> Aren't 2/3 and 4/6 not Rats?

[18:55] <pmichaud> they're rats

[18:55] <colomon> rakudo: say 2 / 3 == 4 / 6

[18:55] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2:  ( no output )

[18:55] *** zamolxes joined
[18:55] <pmichaud> rakudo should be numifying each value and comparing that

[18:55] <colomon> rakudo: say (2 / 3) == (4 / 6)

[18:55] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[18:55] <colomon> Ah.

[18:56] <colomon> I suppose if they the same num and den, they will map to the same Num, yes?

[18:56] <pmichaud> supposedly

[18:56] <moritz_> aye

[18:57] <colomon> Worthwhile for "efficiency" to overload anyway?  Is overloading == even possible at the moment?

[18:58] <frettled> rakudo: say (4/2 / 6/2) # Is this 4/2/6/2 or (4/2) / (6/2)?

[18:58] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´1/6‚ê§¬ª

[18:58] <frettled> yay

[18:58] <colomon> 4/2/6/2, eh?

[18:59] <frettled> :)

[18:59] <pmichaud> rakudo is likely wrong there.

[18:59] <pmichaud> I suspect that should be 2/3

[18:59] <frettled> is the rat supposed to have lower precedence?

[18:59] <pmichaud> rakudo:  say ((4/2) / (6/2))

[18:59] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´2/3‚ê§¬ª

[18:59] <pmichaud> rats are terms

[18:59] *** ispy_ left
[18:59] <frettled> the rat division, even.

[18:59] <pmichaud> 4/2 is a term,    4 / 2   is a division

[18:59] <colomon> What about 4 / 2 / 6?

[19:00] <pmichaud> 4 / 2 / 6   is the same as   4 * 1/2 * 1/6

[19:00] <frettled> rakudo: say 4 / 2 / 6

[19:00] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´1/3‚ê§¬ª

[19:00] <pmichaud> oh, wait

[19:00] *** SmokeMachine left
[19:00] <pmichaud> right, it'd be  (4 / 2) / 6

[19:00] <colomon> but why should you prefer that to 4 / (2 / 6)?

[19:00] <frettled> rakudo: say 4 / 2 / 6 / 2

[19:00] <pmichaud> because division is left associative

[19:00] <p6eval> rakudo 4b9cd2: OUTPUT¬´1/6‚ê§¬ª

[19:01] <TimToady> but yes, 4/2 is a Rat literal

[19:01] <TimToady> at least according to STD

[19:01] <pmichaud> in perl5, 4 / 2 / 6 gives me 0.333333333333333333

[19:01] <frettled> Cool.  Yet another thing for obfuscated Perl 6 coding contests.  Muahahaha.

[19:01] <pmichaud> Rakudo just does the same :)

[19:03] <TimToady> likewise 1+2i is supposed to be a complex literal

[19:03] <TimToady> looks like S02 is deficient in stating that

[19:04] <pmichaud> also, we noticed yesterday that S05 doesn't have :my

[19:04] <TimToady> nodnod

[19:04] <moritz_> isn't it ':'\w .*? ';' being a Perl expression?

[19:04] <moritz_> modulo one-pass parsing

[19:05] <TimToady> no

[19:05] <frettled> TimToady: oh, right, that was that complex number spec thingy that I was supposed to come up with a proposal for.

[19:06] <TimToady> moritz_: but I'm not quite sure what you're really asking

[19:07] <pugs_svn> r28162 | colomon++ | [t/spec] Fixed dead_beef.face, prior version relied on div of two integers producing a fractional number. 

[19:07] <moritz_> TimToady: I thought that under some circumstances ':' in regexes allow inline Perl 6 code

[19:07] <moritz_> arbitrary code, that is

[19:07] <colomon> moritz_: Are you working on cleaning up rat.t, or would you like me to do that (now that I've spectest'd my shiny new rakudo clone)?

[19:08] <TimToady> colomon: it's kinda fun to stir the ant nest and see all the ants scurrying around :)

[19:08] <moritz_> colomon: I'm currently rather distracted, so feel free

[19:08] <TimToady> moritz_: oh, that, yes; sorry I dropped the context on the floor

[19:09] <TimToady> but I think the \w must be a known declarator

[19:10] *** ispy_ joined
[19:10] <TimToady> (one can always use a :my ($) = side_effect; where the declaration is just a peg for the init.)

[19:10] <TimToady> in fact, I was very happy when I figured out that one could use a null record for that in Ada

[19:22] <colomon> Okay, if I implement Rat.nude, what's the cleanest way to check that two arrays match in Test.pm?

[19:23] <moritz_> is_deeply Rat.new(1,4), [1, 4], 'description';

[19:24] <moritz_> yes

[19:24] <moritz_> but with a comma added ;-)

[19:24] <colomon> gotcha

[19:25] *** r0bby left
[19:29] <pmichaud> is  Rat.new(1,4).nude, (1,4), 'description'    is what I'd be after

[19:30] <colomon> why the differences?

[19:30] <pmichaud> I don't think we need is_deeply here.  we're just testing equivalence of two immutable lists

[19:30] <colomon> and as long as I've got you there, why $!numerator instead of $.numerator in Str?

[19:30] <colomon> Rat.Str, I mean.

[19:31] <moritz_> pmichaud is right

[19:31] <pmichaud> in .Str I was avoiding the method call

[19:31] <pmichaud> but I agree with TimToady++ that  Rat.Str should forward to Num.Str

[19:32] <colomon> Right, I just wanted to make sure it was okay if I used $.numerator elsewhere in the class def.

[19:32] <pmichaud> sure, it's fine.  It does impose an extra method call at the moment

[19:32] <jaffa8> God++

[19:32] <jaffa8> ++++

[19:33] <pmichaud> we'd want to use $.numerator if we think Rat will be used in another class composition where .numerator might be overloaded, though :)

[19:34] <pmichaud> +1

[19:36] *** maerzhase joined
[19:37] <moritz_> colomon: in the first few cases I'd make the second argument to is() a string literal

[19:37] <pmichaud> that's fine with me also

[19:37] <colomon> moritz_: I didn't do that because I don't want to lock in a particular way of stringifying the number

[19:37] <moritz_> colomon: the prepend at least a ~

[19:38] <pmichaud> I'd put ~ in front of the second argument 

[19:38] <colomon> Okay, can do.

[19:38] <moritz_> I don't think it makes much of a difference, but testing a stringification against a string seems much saner ;-)

[19:38] <pmichaud> then you know that you're making sure they stringify ..... what moritz++ types faster than me

[19:38] <colomon> Fair enough!

[19:39] <colomon> is(~(Rat.new(1,4)), ~(0.25), "Rats stringify properly");

[19:40] <colomon> (It does work, all the new tests pass now.)

[19:41] <moritz_> so that 'for Rat.new(2, 3).nude { .say }' prints two lines

[20:02] <[1]jaffa8> What serious function_

[20:04] *** mr_ank joined

[20:04] * hugme hugs [1]jaffa8

[20:05] <[1]jaffa8> maybe I can spare a small time to create an example

[20:14] <colomon> nah, it's just a bug of mine.

[20:14] *** SmokeMachine joined
[20:14] <frettled> oh, because of the div - / change?

[20:15] <colomon> Well, because of writing that portion of Rat.

[20:15] *** donaldh_ joined
[20:15] <colomon> but the change is why 2 / 3 is a Rat.

[20:18] <moritz_> that should be Rat.new($b.denominator * $a, $b.numerator)

[20:18] <colomon> Right!

[20:18] <colomon> I wasn't finding it because I kept on looking at denominator and numerator to see what was wrong.

[20:19] <colomon> It was the very last test I was going to add today.

[20:20] <colomon> The previous test for that operator was wrong in the exact way needed to hide the bug.  :)

[20:22] <frettled> Thanks, I think I just might have learned something tonight, too.

[20:22] <colomon> I'm pondering adding a bunch of tests that just compare the results you get with Rat with the Num versions....

[22:02] <masak> thank you, kind sir.

[22:03] <moritz_> so what should I blog about this weekend? ;-)

[22:03] <frettled> moritz_: rats and other pests :D

[22:04] <moritz_> we haven't had a Tidings post in quite some time

[22:04] <masak> true.

[22:07] <jnthn> ooh a masakpost

[22:07] *** rindolf left
[22:07] <masak> a longish one. and it's executable!

[22:08] <jnthn> ...if only I could find total happiness as easy as you did... :-)

[22:08] <masak> I don't actually need to point out that all the really cool readers paste the blog post and try running it through perl6-literate, do I?

[22:08] <masak> the reward is an ASCII labyrinth!

[22:08] <jnthn> (mention of qbasic)++

[22:09] <masak> my favourite was always Turbo Basic, though.

[22:09] <masak> it was a few years earlier, and had debugging.

[22:09] <masak> unlike QBasic, it also compiled to .EXE -- Quick Basic did too, IIRC.

[22:10] <jnthn> masak: It wasn't until this post that I actually got what literate programming actually *is*.

[22:10] <jnthn> Wow, such a simple idea. :-)

[22:10] <jnthn> masak: So I just prefix code in the blog post with > ?

[22:10] <masak> jnthn: even this is a distortion of the original idea, mind.

[22:11] <masak> jnthn: yes.

[22:11] <masak> jnthn: and keep blank lines between code and comments.

[22:11] <jeekobu> Such mazes can be generated by random walks with completely local checks

[22:12] <masak> jeekobu: is that so?

[22:12] <jeekobu> Yeah

[22:12] <moritz_> jeekobu: write a blog post about it!

[22:12] <jnthn> masak: Nice, I may try that.

[22:12] <jeekobu> Give me a little while and I can probably sketch it up
