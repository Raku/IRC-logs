[09:35] <masak> hacking on proto today.

[09:35] <masak> proto has now been updated to download Bratislava.

[09:36] <masak> szabgab: if and when you have the time, I would happily discuss ways to make proto less... surprising... when it comes to downloading Rakudo without asking.

[09:36] *** abra left
[09:36] <szabgab> sure

[09:37] *** abra joined
[09:37] <masak> there are a few overriding concerns that have led to the current design.

[09:37] <masak> but I don't doubt that the same restrictions could lead to a saner way to do things.

[09:42] <masak> @ask pmichaud no http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-04.tar.this month?

[09:42] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[09:47] <mberends> masak: re: proto installing rakudo in a subdir, that shoots removing proto in the foot. How about proto trying to install rakudo in proto's parent dir. Then proto and rakudo are siblings instead of parent/child. a sibling dir next to itself.

[09:48] <masak> mberends: that's basically the setup I've chosen on my box. I have all the Perl 6 projects as siblings, and only the Rakudo install in the projects dir.

[09:49] <masak> mberends: up until now, I've been a bit reluctant to act outside of the proto dir by default.

[09:49] <masak> it feels like we don't know at all what permissions and stuff we have there.

[09:50] <masak> plus, it gives me bad vibes of DOS .zip files which didn't create a directory to play in, but instead just dumped eveything in .

[09:51] <mberends> you can feel comfortable that wherever you were allowed to create a directory (proto) you will be allowed to create a few more.

[09:52] <masak> indeed.

[09:52] <mberends> agreed the .zip content pollution is bad, but our tools never do that afaik.

[09:52] <masak> the question is basically: how violated will the user feel if that's the default?

[09:53] <masak> right now we err on the side of extreme caution.

[09:53] <mberends> totally unviolated here. I have other techniques for that ;)

[09:53] <masak> well, do you have proto in your ~ ?

[09:53] <mberends> yes

[09:53] <masak> ok. :)

[09:54] <masak> you're slowly convincing me.

[09:54] <mberends> and rakudo next to it, and proto's rakudo several turtles down.

[09:54] <masak> now the two approaches seem equally valid to me.

[09:55] <masak> but I have no reason to choose one over the other.

[09:55] <mberends> because I'm too stupid and lazy to RTFM about the RAKUDO_DIR thing when starting proto.

[09:55] <masak> by the way, we should probably write down the design bylaws for proto somewhere.

[09:55] <mberends> as a section of WTOP.

[09:55] <mberends> WTOL.

[09:56] <masak> mberends: proto is designed with that in mind. "it should just work" is an overriding concern, only limited by "don't be evil".

[09:56] <masak> mberends: well, WTOP is a bit more general and a bit more specific, I think. :)

[09:57] <masak> this is more like "the philosophy of proto". we invent a set of hypothetical users, and then we go out of our way to please them.

[09:58] <mberends> the sibling dir is less evil in the sense that proto can be replaced by proto+1 with less harm to the user's project directories.

[09:58] <mberends> (they just have a deps.proto file left over)

[12:03] <moritz_> szabgab: one more thing... there are some non-breaking spaces in section names (ie Perl\NS6)... could they be treated equal to normal spaces?

[12:03] <moritz_> szabgab: they cause quite a lot of trouble, because most editors don't show the difference

[12:03] <szabgab> I am not sure I understand

[12:03] <szabgab> can you show an example?

[12:03] <szabgab> s/show/point to/

[12:04] <moritz_> S03/Changes to Perl¬†5 operators/

[12:04] <moritz_> the space between Perl and 5 is a non-breaking space

[12:04] <moritz_> when you write an ordinary blank in that point, the smart links used to fail

[12:04] <moritz_> saying "no such section" or so

[12:05] <szabgab> in which file is that ?

[12:05] <moritz_> the section header is in S03-operators.pod

[12:05] <szabgab> and why would we want to write such things ?

[12:05] <moritz_> because we don't want line breaks between 'Perl' and '5'

[12:06] <moritz_> and because TimToady is a linguist ;-)

[12:06] <moritz_> t/spec/S03-operators/assign.t shows a good example for a smartlink to that

[12:07] <moritz_> at least when in double quotes the space should be equivalent to non-breaking space IMHO

[12:09] <pugs_svn> r26457 | szabgab++ | Smart::Links some Pugs specific things to be turned on if PUGS_SNARTLINKS is set

[12:10] <szabgab> so if I understand you correctly you would like to write regular breaking space in the .t file in the smartlink

[12:14] <szabgab> maybe [\s$nbsp]  ?

[12:15] <pugs_svn> r26459 | moritz++ | [t/spec] more smartlink fixes

[12:15] <moritz_> yes

[12:15] <moritz_> [\s$nbsp]+ actually ;-)

[12:16] <szabgab> and how do I write the content of $nbsp in Perl ?

[12:17] *** abra left
[12:17] <szabgab> actually I think it would be more correct -linguistically- if we required the non-breaking spaces in the smartlinks as well

[12:17] *** abra joined
[12:17] <moritz_> szabgab: I know it's not correct, but would be *very* convenient ;-)

[12:18] <frettled> Somehow, I think it's wrong to say that this is linguistics, it looks like typography to me.  :)

[12:19] <szabgab> isn't typography just written lingustics ? :-)

[12:20] <frettled> szabgab: not really.  Ligatures are (typically) typographic tricks.

[12:20] <frettled> the non-breaking space is a computer-typographic trick to enforce a specific rule in print.

[12:20] <frettled> The semantics of e.g. ´Perl 6ª is unchanged.

[12:21] <frettled> In other words, I think allowing a regular space to match (in context of smartlinks) would be correct.

[12:48] *** PacoLinux joined

[16:09] <skids_> On constants from NCI APIs:

[16:10] <skids_> In an ideal world, one could dispense with the library prefixes on constants when they are tedious, e.g. "GLUT_"

[16:10] <skids_> And at the same time still work with them outside of the class

[16:11] <skids_> And at the same time not pollute the namespace

[16:11] <skids_> (somehow, have the cake and eat it too)

[16:12] <skids_> One way might be to somehow allow the class namespace to leak into the argument () area.

[16:13] <skids_> (on the class's methods)

[16:15] <skids_> Or there might be a macro-ish solution with the currently specced tools that is not too onerous.

[16:53] <skids_> Like maybe we should allow parameters to take an "is parsed" trait.  Done at compile time, if the constraints are tight enough.

[16:53] <skids_> And the "is parsed" would happen in the namespace of the class that owns the method/sub.

[16:54] *** goksie left

[21:18] *** goksie joined
[21:20] <pmurias> skids_: in Perl6 use imports into the lexical scope by default

[21:20] <pmurias> so namespace polution is not an issue

[21:25] <pmurias> skids_: passing flags as or'ed integers is a Cism and can be replace with named arguments in most cases

[21:25] <jnthn> Named arguments would probably make quite a nice interface.

[21:28] *** goksie_ joined
[21:33] <skids_> Yes if you are going to "do it right" you'd want to rework the entire API.

[21:34] <skids_> But that may be more effort and/or some module writers may want a feel-alike.

[21:34] *** braceta joined
[21:36] <skids_> That and some APIs may be autogen from headers.

[21:36] <pmurias> skids_: one might want to write my $flags = DOUBLE | RGBA;glutInitDisplayMode($flags);

[21:37] <skids_> Yeah, that would be $flags = new Glut::Mode (DOUBLE | RGBA).

[21:37] <skids_> erm, well Glut::Mode.new 

[21:38] <pmurias> polluting the lexical scope isn't a very big thing

[21:38] <skids_> Depends whether the API you are doing will create collisions with keywords.

[21:38] <skids_> And other API defines.

[21:39] <skids_> (constants)

[21:39] *** iblechbot left
[21:40] <pmurias> skids_: making constants visible only inside arguments lists seems to me too much of a magic rule

[21:40] <pmurias> * argument

[21:42] <skids_> Yeah well, I'm not sold on it myself, just a suggestion.  We'll see what the first few attempts at NCI interfaces yield and whether they "make Perl6 proud"

[21:42] <skids_> Maybe the existing spec will be cleverly utilized.  Maybe there will be holes.

[21:43] <skids_> The biggest problem I see with an "is parsed" param trait is that you have to lock down the MMD by making it not a multi or typing carefully your vars.

[21:43] <skids_> Otherwise the parse would have to be runtime.

[21:44] <skids_> Personally the part about special syntax in parameter lists does not bother me because people can do it anyway with a Str param.

[21:44] <skids_> This would just be allowing it to compile efficiently (and to not use the quotes)

[21:46] <pmurias> skids_: you can quasi-quotes your custom languages

[21:47] <skids_> The quotes are not serious consideration here, just a fringe benefit.

[21:47] <pmurias> skids_: macros can already do what you are proposing

[21:48] <skids_> Yes this would just be a way to fit a macro in where you really want it.

[21:49] <skids_> I guess we will know if NCI implementers start resorting to marco-izing their whole APIs.

[21:49] <skids_> Then something like that would be more worth consideration, to discourage that.

[21:51] *** goksie left
[21:56] <japhb> skids_: GL (and all of its various hangers-on) is one of those APIs that people definitely want feel-alike wrappers for; the most I see shim authors do is convert all of the glFoo[1234]{type} in the C layer to just glFoo (and have the shim either dynamically or via MMD determine the proper variant to call)

[21:57] <pmurias> hOpenGL does it and it's pretty annoying

[21:57] <japhb> Fundamentally, it's an API that wants to be fully exported, because it's pretty good about namespace prefixes, and as a performance-critical API, any overhead is strictly to be avoided.

[21:57] <japhb> pmurias: "it"?

[21:58] *** braceta left
[21:58] <pmurias> dropping the {type}

[21:58] <pmurias> as one has to cast floats into GLfloats all over the place

[21:59] <japhb> pmurias: Oh yeah.  Silently assuming float everywhere doesn't allow you to optimize e.g. space required for index arrays.

[22:00] <japhb> A lot of GL shims use their language's C type array facility (ctypes or numpy for Python, PDL or OpenGL::Array for Perl, and so on).  But if you can't choose any data type other than float, you lose a lot of power there.

[22:01] <japhb> pmurias: blech.  You should never have to do casting to use GL.  The few places where coersion is desired, the API has entry points explicitly for that.

[22:01] <pmurias> japhb: hOpenGL didn't now if 0 was a float or an int so you had to cast it into GLfloat

[22:02] <japhb> EWWW.

[22:02] *** ZuLuuuuuu left
[22:03] <japhb> SDL::OpenGL used to have bugs that interacted badly with Perl 5's constant attempts to int-ify internally.  They'd pull the intval and call the float entry point, or vice versa.

[22:05] <pmurias> japhb: Perl 6 has buf* types so passing raw data shouldn't be a problem

[22:06] <pmurias> hopengl used Ptr () which is just a haskell version of void*

[22:06] *** jhuni joined
[22:06] <japhb> In any case, I still need to figure out what to do about the GL constants.  My local install defines 4248 of them.  I need to find a way to express that to Rakudo that isn't going to run smack into compile-time scalability problems, while still being efficient at run time.

[22:07] <japhb> Then again, maybe I *should* expose any compile-time scalability problems.  :-)

[22:08] <japhb> pmurias: nodnod.  Unfortunately, I get the strong feeling that buf* will be a long time coming.  Especially since Parrot's NCI data types model is not nearly as general as Perl 6 wants.

[22:08] <jnthn> japhb: You're not the first to want Buf.

[22:09] <jnthn> japhb: I'm kinda aware it's wanted...

[22:09] <jnthn> Not worked out exactly what it needs or how to do it yet.

[22:09] <skids_> :-)

[22:09] <japhb> jnthn: I didn't mean to imply that the Rakudo team was the blocker.  Rather, I think Parrot NCI is the blocker.

[22:09] <jnthn> That may well be the case.

[22:10] <japhb> It's hard to express something in an HLL that the VM can't wrap its head around.  :-)

[22:10] <pmurias> japhb: does turning the constants into subs cause problems?

[22:10] <japhb> pmurias: Hadn't tried yet (I've been distracted with @family) ... was going to ask if that was the consensus recommendation.

[22:11] <skids_> Inlines, one would hope -- but do we do inlines yet?

[22:13] <jnthn> skids_: No, but I expect anything declared with constant we will make a good effort to inline sooner than any more general mechanism for inlining appears.

[22:15] <japhb> jnthn: what syntax should I use ... I'm going to hack up something to convert the PASM macro file into something Rakudo can eat.
