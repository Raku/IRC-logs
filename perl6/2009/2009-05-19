[01:24] <azawawi> TimToady: how do i access CURPKG and CURPAD after using STD->parse?

[01:39] *** Whiteknight left
[01:45] <TimToady> there is no valid CURPKG or CURPAD outside of the parse.  that's what makes it "CUR".  you need to store them somewhere in a reduction action

[01:46] <TimToady> that's more or less what the YOU_ARE_HERE is for in remembering the CURPAD for a setting

[01:56] <azawawi> hmmm.. so how do i access the symbol table that STD builds?

[01:59] *** sri_kraih joined
[02:00] <TimToady> CURPAD has ::OUTER links all the way up to CORE, and CORE contains ::GLOBAL

[02:02] <TimToady> CURPKG has ::PARENT links up to GLOBAL, as well

[02:04] <TimToady> internally we also maintain $::CORE and $::GLOBAL

[02:04] <TimToady> to get at things from the top

[02:04] <TimToady> but in theory everything can be reconstructed from $CURPAD

[02:08] <azawawi> i see, thx

[02:09] *** angelixd left
[02:09] <azawawi> i think i should turn S:H:P6 to use viv instead...

[05:50] <moritz_> wow, longest spectest run ever: 27151 wallclock secs

[05:51] <moritz_> (there was a suspend-to-disk in between ;-)

[05:51] <japhb> heh

[05:52] <japhb> mberends: I'm working my way through HTTP::Daemon, and I was wondering about a couple things in the source that seemed odd.

[05:53] *** harig joined
[05:53] <japhb> For example, why does HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn have several methods that declare their invocant?

[05:53] * mberends looks

[05:53] <japhb> as in method foo ($self:) {... $self.do_something ...}

[05:55] <japhb> Also, why is send_status_line a multi method?

[05:56] <japhb> (And it's got a bug, BTW: Instead of \n, it should send crlf of course, as you mention in a comment just below.  ;-)  )

[05:57] <mberends> japhb: some of this code is sloppy cruft left over from the NPW Hackathon. It needs cage cleaning :/

[05:58] <japhb> Care for help with said cage cleaning?

[05:58] <mberends> nice idea. Do you already have an account on Gitorious?

[05:59] <japhb> I signed up earlier today, but the email still has not arrived.  :-(

[06:00] <japhb> OOC, why gitorious instead of github?

[06:00] *** Maghnus left
[06:01] <mberends> ok, when your account is confirmed, you can become contributor to http://gitorious.org/http-daemon where I plan to maintain a core version for inclusion into other projects.

[06:01] <japhb> thanks!

[06:02] * japhb wonders why an automated email should take more than a few seconds ....

[06:02] <mberends> Gitorious because I don't believe in putting all eggs into one basket.

[06:03] <japhb> Fair enough.  Though the nice thing about a DVCS is that the single basket problem gets a lot less troublesome.

[06:04] <mberends> the proto installer also benefits from test cases on different servers.

[06:06] <japhb> Ah, speaking of which, I was going to offer a proto patch that would try cloning personal forks even before writable masters, but I realized I don't understand how the gitorious personal fork naming convention works.

[06:06] <mberends> the aim of this Daemon BTW is to be as faithful as possible to the Perl 5 original. Others such as masak, Tene and ruoso have re-gutted it with custom dispatchers.

[06:07] <mberends> japhb: that would be a nice proto enhancement, let's look at that too.

[06:08] <japhb> mberends: OK, I'll keep the Perl 5 source around to compare against while I go.

[06:11] <mberends> japhb: the compatibility is at the API level, keeping to the perldoc.

[06:12] <mberends> I'm planning to do the same with more of LWP. Gisle Aas wrote me that he doesn't mind.

[06:12] <japhb> mberends: Nod.  I meant that I planned to favor the actual behavior where it disagreed with the docs.

[06:13] <japhb> Why would he mind?  Ownership of namespace?

[06:13] <mberends> my broad goal is to help Perl 5 users move to Perl 6 easily.

[06:14] <japhb> A worthy goal.  :-)

[06:14] <mberends> I did not want to tread on toes if others are already planning their Perl 6 moves.

[06:15] <japhb> Good manners, that.

[06:23] <masak> it says Matcher.

[06:31] <masak> japhb: it's in web right now.

[06:31] <masak> japhb: not because it uses anything else in that project, but because it was created in the context of that project. :)

[06:32] <masak> our policy on whether to put 'third-party' things in the web repository or outside of it is a bit hazy still...

[06:33] <japhb> nod.

[06:33] <japhb> But where is it?  I can't seem to find it in the web repo that proto checks out ... is proto out of date WRT to the correct repo location/owner?

[06:34] <moritz_> lib/Tags.pm

[06:34] <moritz_> http://github.com/masak/web/blob/d5d439e9f5772cd53c23df87cd7bbdd6ff89739e/lib/Tags.pm

[06:35] <masak> japhb: no, proto should be up-to-date on that account.

[06:35] <japhb> Test.pm  Web  Web.pm

[06:35] <masak> japhb: update?

[06:35] <japhb> Just did the initial checkout earlier today.  But sure, why not?  ;-)

[06:35] <masak> japhb: either 'git pull origin master' in the web dir, or './proto update web' in the proto dir.

[06:36] <masak> japhb: I'm pretty sure we have more than that in lib/ :)

[06:36] <japhb> Hum.

[06:38] <japhb> It appears to have somehow gotten locked into a fork I did a LONG time ago:

[06:38] <japhb> $ git pull origin master

[06:38] <japhb> From [email@hidden.address]
[06:39] * japhb kicks it in the head

[06:39] <japhb> Oh yeah, that looks MUCH better

[06:39] <japhb> PEBCAK

[06:39] <masak> japhb: might it be that there was already a web dir where proto tried to install the official one?

[06:40] <masak> japhb: if proto didn't signal an error at such a situation, that's an error. :)

[06:40] <japhb> masak: Yes, it's possible.  My ~/git is getting rather bloated.

[06:41] <masak> when I go './proto install web', it says 'Won't install web: already installed.'

[06:42] <japhb> masak: I had started the whole party with './proto install all' which seems to need a bit of hand-holding.  It is quite possible I held them incorrectly.

[06:42] <masak> oh, that's not something I've tested properly.

[06:42] <masak> but ISTR that it skips things already installed.

[06:42] <masak> so you'd have wound up with your web dir untouched.

[06:44] <azawawi> moritz_: any idea if this is a rakudo bug, http://sial.org/pbot/36698 ?

[06:45] <masak> azawawi: works if I do s/pod1/pod/, though.

[06:46] <azawawi> masak: yeah but it doesnt print out any error or anything...

[06:46] <azawawi> masak: silently ignores the rest...

[06:46] <masak> azawawi: you're right, that is odd.

[06:46] <masak> azawawi: submit a rakudobug.

[06:48] <japhb> Ack.  Pbbbt.  It looks like web and http-daemon have near-identical Daemon.pm files.  Which one is canonical?

[06:49] <masak> http-daemon, at least after mberends++ finishes his refactor.

[06:49] <masak> the one in web is going away.

[06:50] <masak> (because Web.pm is supposedly engine-agnostic)

[06:50] <japhb> Refactor of what?  Web.pm's use of an engine, or the copy of Daemon.pm in http-daemon?

[06:50] <japhb> (I don't want to start hacking on http-daemon if the code is about to get mutilated out from under me.)

[06:51] <azawawi> masak: how do i submit a rakudo bug, rakudobug at perl.org?

[06:52] <masak> japhb: in any case, you should confer with mberends, if you haven't done so already.

[06:52] <masak> azawawi: aye.

[06:52] <japhb> masak: I was a bit ago (before you came in), but he had to run apparently

[06:52] <azawawi> masak: and where can i view current rakudo bugs?

[06:52] <masak> azawawi: http://rt.perl.org/rt3/

[06:53] * azawawi hates RT :)

[06:53] <masak> japhb: all I know is that the HTTP::Daemon in web works. I don't know whether the one in http-daemon is dated or improved.

[06:53] <masak> japhb: maybe the changelog will tell you that.

[06:54] <japhb> I diffed.  The only difference is four lines of POD.

[06:54] <masak> japhb: :)

[06:55] *** DemoFreak joined
[06:55] <masak> japhb: I'd recomment hacking on http-daemon, since that's the one not going away.

[06:55] <japhb> However, I guess no time like the present to begin.  :-)

[06:55] <japhb> nodnod

[07:05] <masak> mberends: let's say A depends on B. if I go './proto install A B', with none of them installed, the following will happen: proto will fetch A, fetch B, and build them. then it will unnecessarily update B, because it's still in the list of things to be installed-or-updated. this is (I guess) acceptable, but a bit... unnecessary.

[07:41] <masak> yay!

[07:41] * moritz_ doesn't quite understand masak's excitement about such a simple patch ;-)

[07:42] <masak> moritz_: it's quite significant, I think.

[07:43] <moritz_> well, having built-ins written in Perl 6 makes that really trivial ;-)

[07:43] <masak> hm, the usage example of map in S32/Containers.pod:

[07:43] <masak> .. @addresses = map { %addresses_by_name{$_} }, @names;

[07:44] <masak> (the two dots were to un-confuse lambdabot)

[07:44] <moritz_> can of course be done with a slice

[07:44] <masak> yes, that was my point.

[07:44] <moritz_>  @test

[07:44] <masak> making it a slightly un-good example for didactic reasons.

[07:44] <moritz_> a space is enough already ;-)

[07:44] <masak> moritz_: ah, yes, will do that next time.

[07:45] <moritz_> well, feel free to think of a better example ;-)

[07:45] <masak> I will.

[07:45] <masak> actually, I'm thinking of just cutting it for now.

[07:45] *** payload left
[07:46] <masak> the spec should be succinct, IMHO. and the example doesn't say anything the signature didn't already convey.

[07:46] <moritz_> +1

[07:46] * masak makes it so

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26882 | masak++ | [S32/Containers.pod] removed examples from 'map'

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26882 | masak++ | 

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26882 | masak++ | The examples didn't particularly add anything that the synopsis didn't

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26882 | masak++ | already make clear. Also, the first example could have been written better

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26882 | masak++ | with a hash slice, making it didactically non-ideal.

[07:50] <pugs_svn> r26883 | masak++ | fixed a typo and a missing comma

[07:51] <masak> I used to love SVN because it was not CVS. now, only git-svn can make SVN bearable for me. funny how that works.

[07:51] <moritz_> @karma masak

[07:51] <lambdabot> masak has a karma of 184

[07:52] <Matt-W> It's because you realised that SVN is just CVS done less badly

[07:52] <moritz_> yes, I'm sold for DCVS' too

[07:52] <Matt-W> The fundamental flaws are still there

[07:52] <masak> Matt-W: they are indeed.

[07:52] <moritz_> there's a nice rant from linus torvalds on youtube (or google tech talk)

[07:52] <masak> Matt-W: but I can feel smug for getting some advantages out of git while working against SVN.

[07:53] <moritz_> he's got a point, but he really behaved like an asshole

[07:53] <masak> moritz_: I was torn over that video too.

[07:53] <masak> moritz_: first time I watched it, I thought 'asshole'.

[07:53] <moritz_> well, I still think that

[07:53] <masak> moritz_: second time, I realized that he was basically painting his enemy really clearly.

[07:54] <masak> moritz_: still an asshole, I guess, but I see now that it was very deliberate.

[07:54] <moritz_> just because somebody hasn't been exposed to a different technology doesn't mean he's stupid or brain-dead or whatever

[07:54] <masak> moritz_: true.

[07:55] <masak> moritz_: being nuanced is hard. he's being very clear, and trading humility and politeness for clarity.

[07:55] <masak> I wouldn't. but then again, I'm not him.

[07:56] <masak> he's known for doing the same on mailing lists etc.

[07:56] <moritz_> ah well. I still use his software ;-)

[07:57] <moritz_> though I wouldn't mind having a few different kernels to plug in into my debian, just to have alternatives

[07:57] <moritz_> there's a debian-freebsd port, and an unoffical opensolaris port (called nexenta)

[08:04] <japhb> mberends: gitorious account finally acquired.  Turns out their account verification email came from a misconfigured server, and the anti-spam rules at my hosting provider rejected it.

[08:05] <masak> moritz_: no, but I've always wanted to. I hear there's a debian-hurd in the works too.

[08:05] <japhb> masak: has been for AGES.

[08:06] <masak> japhb: sounds like something the github team might want to hear about.

[08:06] <japhb> (in the works I mean)

[08:06] <masak> japhb: if you say so. :) I only heard about it recently.

[08:06] <japhb> masak: Already spoke to gitorious support.

[08:06] <masak> japhb++

[08:07] <masak> their page says it's 'not officially released yet'. http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/

[08:09] <japhb> masak: yep.  Been that way since IIRC even before Hurd could boot.

[08:09] <japhb> Debian was one of the first distros to try it.

[08:09] <masak> Debian++

[08:09] <masak> I think it's my favourite distro by far.

[08:09] <masak> the more I learn about it, the more I like it.

[08:13] <japhb> Ditto that.

[08:16] <japhb> masak: './proto update http-daemon' does not seem to make the .pir files, even though it claims to have built it.

[08:16] *** ejs joined
[08:17] <japhb> do a 'make clean' in http-daemon, you can see what I mean.

[08:17] *** ejs1 joined
[08:17] <masak> japhb: yes, there's a flaw in proto that causes that. it doesn't build any project correctly right now.

[08:17] <japhb> masak: any idea what it is?  Or should I just go wildly spelunking?  :-)

[08:18] <masak> japhb: on my box, it has to do with 'env'.

[08:18] * japhb raises an eyebrow

[08:19] <masak> or rather, the paths sent to env causes env to die.

[08:19] <masak> so all my make.log files contain the same two lines: 'env: projects: No such file or directory', repeated twice.

[08:30] <japhb> *chuckle*

[08:30] <masak> japhb: I'll accept the part of the patch that fixes the problem. I try to avoid both commented-out code and verbosity in proto.

[08:31] *** ejs2 joined
[08:32] <japhb> masak: No problem.  But you might consider dropping the commented warn, but keeping the $cmd refactoring ... since I find I often come back to wanting to debug commands I'm about to execute.

[09:04] <Matt-W> I'm only understanding about a quarter of the lyrics of course

[09:04] <moritz_> understandable

[09:05] <moritz_> I've been on two of their concerts

[09:05] <moritz_> the first one was fine (they weren't well known at that time), but the second one was really great

[09:06] <Matt-W> I think one requires a very high level of language to understand songs in a second language

[09:06] *** clintongormley left
[09:06] <moritz_> aye. It really helps to read the lyrics once, IMHO

[09:06] <Matt-W> Probably

[09:29] <jnthn> pmichaud++ and Tene++ for doing parts of what it's taken to get us here too. :-)

[09:30] <moritz_> I wonder, should p6eval filter out back traces? (or at least partially?)

[09:31] <moritz_> or are they usually suffieciently short so that we don't care?

[09:31] <masak> moritz_: I'm in ur STD, checking your bug. the error message is issued on line 3758, and it seems to my untrained eye as if the check done is 'is this an optional parameter?', when it should really be 'is this an optional positional parameter?'

[11:40] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[11:40] <moritz_> masak: Stage 2 = pir + setting

[11:40] <masak> ooh.

[11:40] <moritz_> wrt builtins, that is

[11:40] <masak> yes.

[11:41] <masak> moritz_: if your blog isn't a tutorial, I don't know what is. :)

[11:41] <moritz_> masak: it's an attempt to show off cool Perl 6 features, teaching those along the way

[11:41] <masak> ...as opposed to...? :)

[11:42] <moritz_> masak: it's not an attempt to teach programming in Perl 6

[11:42] <masak> fair enough.

[11:42] <moritz_> it's mostly a matter of choosing the topics

[11:43] <moritz_> however I guess it could be turned into a tutorial

[11:44] <jnthn> masak: We have a s1 compiler because we need a Perl 6 compiler to be able to compile Perl 6, and the setting is written in Perl 6. :-)

[11:46] <masak> moritz_: I find the idea of "Learning Y assuming X" to be quite nice. it means one can start from something other than the very basics.

[11:46] <masak> jnthn: I see.

[11:47] <jnthn> masak: In theory, the only difference between them is that one lacks the built-ins that are defined in the setting.

[11:47] <moritz_> masak: when I started writing some Perl 6 tutorials in German, I actually wrote three; one for beginners, one for perl 5 programmers and one for programmers in general :-)

[14:37] <masak> azawawi: well... it's basically not tested at all on Windows.

[14:37] * azawawi hmmm.. i can do that

[14:37] <masak> azawawi: I would wager it contains a fair amount of Unixisms.

[14:37] <masak> azawawi: yes, please. :)

[14:37] <masak> azawawi: be prepared to encounter trouble, though.

[14:38] <masak> azawawi: a good set of use cases might be the ones in the README file.

[15:38] *** Psyche^ joined
[15:39] <jnthn> tulcod: maybe that you need unicode:"the string" or something.

[15:39] <jnthn> tulcod: PIR is more normal to write than pasm these days.

[15:39] <tulcod> jnthn: woot, it works using "unicode:"

[15:40] <tulcod> jnthn: well, i'm kinda slowly working my way through the parrot documentation

[15:40] <tulcod> started with the first chapter, which starts with pasm

[15:40] <jnthn> tulcod: :-)

[15:40] <tulcod> and nqp, which i didn't get :(

[15:40] <jnthn> tulcod: Ah, OK, gotcha. :-)

[15:40] <jnthn> nqp is like, a subset of Perl 6.

[15:40] <tulcod> yeah, i know

[15:40] <tulcod> but it didn't get installed by paludis

[15:43] *** Chillance joined
[15:43] <tulcod> what version of parrot do i need for nqp?

[15:44] <mberends> masak: good proto work, sir. it would be really nice to have windows users as well.

[15:45] <masak> mberends: it would indeed.

[15:45] <jnthn> tulcod: Well, NQP has been in Parrot for quite a while, but it may just be that it's not in the main package...

[15:45] <tulcod> 0.6.1?

[15:45] <jnthn> Huh?!

[15:45] <tulcod> is that old?

[15:45] <jnthn> We're on like 1.1 now :-)

[15:45] <jnthn> Yes, very.

[15:45] <tulcod> okay, i guess i should kick the package maintainers' butts :P

[15:46] <masak> mberends: what do you think, should we create circumfix:<` `> in proto after the next monthly release of Rakudo?

[15:47] <masak> mberends: I think it's an abstraction which might come in handy in many places. right now we're a bit hampered by the administration with getting output from processes.

[15:47] <mberends> yes! a fake backtick!

[15:48] <masak> mberends: it can even be made forwards-compatible if we make sure to always write `$cmd` after putting the right command string in $cmd.

[15:48] *** iblechbot left
[15:48] <pmichaud> I think that output from processes may have some support now in Rakudo.

[15:48] <pmichaud> s/Rakudo/Parrot

[15:49] <mberends> sweet, as in sugar

[15:49] <masak> pmichaud: wow!

[15:49] <masak> pmichaud: is there something I can do? can we get backticks before Thursday? :)

[15:49] <pmichaud> We just need to test it and add the relevant bits to Rakudo.

[15:49] <pmichaud> I might even be able to do that today.

[15:49] <masak> awesome!

[15:50] <mberends> (fake^H^H^H^Hreal backticks)++

[15:50] <masak> lately, even the improvements in Rakudo have been getting better. :)

[15:51] <masak> I bet the proto logotype knew this all along, and that's why it's so smug...

[15:51] <Tene> pmichaud: is it possible to get rakudo to assume that the argument to -e is UTF-8?

[15:51] <pmichaud> Tene: well, it's really Parrot that provides the arguments.

[15:51] <Tene> ah

[15:52] <pmichaud> (i.e., the args array in 'main')

[15:52] <pmichaud> I'm not sure what encoding those assume by default.

[15:53] <pmichaud> Let's check.

[15:53] <TimToady> note that real backticks in STD should be quote: rather than circumfix:

[15:53] <TimToady> since the insides are more like a string than an expression

[15:53] <Tene> I was thinking of trying again to add support for term:<‚àÖ> and such to rakudo.  I failed the last time I tried.

[15:53] <TimToady> not that STD does backticks, but that's how it *would* do them

[15:53] *** Patterner left
[15:53] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[15:54] <jnthn> TimToady: Does Perl 6 do backticks?

[15:54] <pmichaud> Tene: It's very unlikely to work until we revamp the parser.

[15:54] <Tene> ah

[15:54] <jnthn> Ah. :-)

[15:54] * Tene AFK driving

[15:54] <TimToady> but it does do qqx//

[15:54] <TimToady> backticks are reserved for user syntax

[15:55] *** dakkar left
[15:57] <pmichaud> Tene: Parrot assumes that command-line arguments are fixed_8 encoding.

[15:57] <pmichaud> If we can find a way to convert the fixed_8 to utf8, then that might work.

[16:03] <pmichaud> Tene:  more to the point, parrot thinks the command-line arguments are ascii

[16:42] <pmichaud> Thursday and Friday won't be so good.

[16:42] <jnthn> Friday would be the other choice. But, sounds good.

[16:43] <pmichaud> Much of Friday I'll be on airplanes.

[16:43] <jnthn> Ah, flying off to remote job?

[16:45] <jnthn> Feels strange to think it's been a year here in Slovakia too...

[16:45] * Tene can believe it's coming up on four years since dropping out of uni

[16:47] <jnthn> pmichaud: Even if I get the branch for switching us over to Perl6MultiSub completely ready before the release, I'm thinking it may be sensible to merge it in afterwards.

[16:48] <jnthn> Unless you see a strong reason to try and make merging that a target for the release.

[16:48] <pmichaud> I don't.

[16:48] <pmichaud> (I.e., I agree it's okay to wait for the release.)

[16:49] <pmichaud> We should also remember that we'll have a PARROT_REVISION freeze between parrot's release today and Rakudo's release.

[16:49] <jnthn> pmichaud: Yes. I got a fix into Parrot for hll_map of MultiSub yesterday.

[16:49] <pmichaud> I'm thinking it's not likely I'll get the combine-loadinit-into-one-sub before Parrot's release, unless the release is much later today.

[16:49] <jnthn> Though it may not be the only one that's needed. But OK, I won't push on it quite so much.

[16:50] <jnthn> Well, if it goes in a bit after we can bump Rakudo up to it after the Rakudo release. It'll be a nice performance win, but it's not critical as such.

[16:50] <pmichaud> Agreed.

[16:51] <pmichaud> It should go in shortly after.

[16:51] <jnthn> Works for me.

[16:51] <pmichaud> (as in, this week)

[16:51] <pmichaud> I'm also expecting to do the rakudo release very late tomorrow

[16:51] <jnthn> I think it should be quite a good release feature wise.

[16:51] <pmichaud> it'll still be "Thursday", but it'll be 00h00 Thursday instead of much later :-)

[16:52] <jnthn> ;-)

[16:52] <jnthn> Thursday is a kinda vague definition anyway.

[16:52] <jnthn> There's plenty of your Wednesday that you could do the release that would be my Thursday. ;-)

[16:52] <pmichaud> well, I consider valid Thursday to be anytime from 00:00 UTC Thu to 05:00 UTC Fri  :-)

[16:53] <pmichaud> (where 05:00 UTC Fri corresponds to 00:00 CDT Fri :-)

[16:53] <jnthn> :-)

[16:54] * jnthn afk for a bit, will update changelog a bit and probably other Rakudo bits later

[16:54] <pmichaud> although I _will_ hold the release if I don't have the ROADMAP ready by then :-|

[16:54] <pmichaud> (which means I really want to get the ROADMAP done.)

[16:54] <jnthn> Yes, that would be really good to have.

[16:54] <pugs_svn> r26885 | lwall++ | [STD] better fix for masak++'s bug

[16:55] <pmichaud> heh

[16:55] <pmichaud> some, but not all.

[16:56] <jnthn> If we'd managed all of it, that would be pretty scary.

[16:56] <pmichaud> we did get some big items done this month, though.

[16:56] <pmichaud> And the next month is looking quite good as well.

[16:56] <moritz_> aye, the ChangeLong is fairly impressive

[19:24] <ruoso> Hello!

[19:24] <moritz_> hi ruoso 

[19:25] <TimToady> mberends: that's not legal Perl 6

[19:25] <ruoso> what's up!

[19:25] <TimToady> std: sub infix:\x{00ab}<=>\x{00bb}( Temporal::Time $left, Temporal::Time $right ) {...}

[19:27] <TimToady> you can't just replace any old character with a \x sequence, and even if you could, \x{...} is P5 notation, not P6

[19:32] <TimToady> std: my ($offset = 8765, $t1, $t2 ); #

[19:33] <TimToady> there's an interesting failure

[19:33] <jnthn> That's a fail?

[19:33] <jnthn> Isn't it a signature after my?

[19:34] *** Trey left
[19:34] <mberends> TimToady: [red-faced] er, it was French quotes when I started several editors ago, it's not what I intended either. Assuming French quotes are fine, will re-commit. Thanks for the eagle eyeing.

[19:34] <TimToady> no eagle eyes involved, except STD.pm

[19:35] <TimToady> jnthn: yes, syntactically it's parsed as a sig, but nothing is ever bound to it, so the zones kinda don't matter

[19:36] <jnthn> rakudo: my ($offset = 8765, $t1, $t2 ); say $offset;

[19:38] <jnthn> Awww.

[19:38] <ruoso> @tell pmurias you removed the init_destr_2 test, is there any test that reproduces that behavior in its place?

[19:38] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[19:38] <moritz_> that error message seems quite sane to me

[19:39] <TimToady> yes, but not on the my

[19:39] <moritz_> right

[19:39] <TimToady> though it would be sane if followed by := ...

[19:40] <TimToady> so I'll probably let it stand

[19:40] <TimToady> STD also complains about the second 'use v6' for some reason

[20:33] <masak> er, s/defined/permitted/

[20:33] <mberends> masak: better golf it is. checking with stage 1 compiler we are unable.

[20:34] <masak> mberends: note that I don't entirely focus on shortness; if so, I'd have preffered the $_-as-invocant version.

[20:34] <masak> rather, I'm trying to make it read well. :P

[20:35] <mberends> this one does read well :)

[20:35] <masak> another variant is (.hour, .minute, .second).fmt('%02d', ':'), that's also quite nice.

[20:36] * masak ‚ô• Perl 6

[20:37] <mberends> where's the join implied in that last one?

[20:37] <masak> mberends: there are four .fmt methods, one is on List.

[20:37] <masak> (the other three are on Any, Hash and Pair)

[20:38] <masak> s/Hash/Map/

[20:38] * ruoso decommute &

[20:38] * moritz_ hasn't really looked at .fmt at all

[20:38] <masak> it's just sugar.

[20:38] *** ruoso left
[20:38] <masak> but oh how sweet!

[20:38] <moritz_> ;-)

[20:39] <moritz_> just like @list.grep: Int ;-)

[20:39] <masak> mmm!

[20:39] <Su-Shee> jnthn: ha! with a slightly newer gcc, everything builds fine. I've just updated to 4.2.4 which was seemingly new enough. 

[20:40] <jnthn> Su-Shee: Nice!

[20:40] <jnthn> you can haz rakudo

[20:40] <masak> that should be the name of someone's talk.

[20:40] <Su-Shee> well, everyone with a standard slackware 12.0 will have the problem as me then.. 

[20:42] <Su-Shee> and there my shiny new perl6 executable is and everything works just fine fresh from git. 

[20:43] <masak> has this question been thoroughly explored yet: now that we have user-ops, what new cool technologies are possible? mathematics is one simple answer; what else?

[20:43] <mberends> where does one share successful procedures such as this Slackware experience?

[20:43] <PerlJam> mberends: use.perl.org is one place

[20:44] <masak> PerlJam: or it used to be, until everyone left. :)

[20:44] <moritz_> well, not everyone left

[20:44] <masak> I know, I overgeneralized.

[20:45] <masak> I'm still there, for one.

[20:45] <moritz_> and I foolishly offered to install a shared blogging system on perlblog.org once I'm back from vacations

[20:45] <masak> moritz_: cool!

[20:45] <moritz_> (after Ovid's rant)

[20:45] <Su-Shee> I'll post it a linux forum where serveral slackware package maintainer are reading.

[20:45] <masak> mberends: how's the Yarn idea going?

[20:47] <mberends> masak: yes, now that the blogserver RAD storm has blown over, I shall refactor the HTTP bits and add sessions and authentication.

[20:47] * masak kinda dug that RAD storm

[20:47] <jnthn> moritz_: I saw that. If you do so, I'll probably migrate.

[20:47] <jnthn> If it seems there's going to be a general movement in that direction, anyways

[20:48] <masak> mberends: let's keep in touch over those HTTP refactorings. I'm interested in where HTTP::Daemon is going.

[20:49] <mberends> masak: sure. HTTP::Engine is similar, and may be worth porting as well for comparison.

[20:50] <masak> mberends: aye.

[20:50] <masak> I think it should be the super-easy default for Web.pm.

[20:51] <masak> Apache is nice and all, but not so easy to provide out-of-the-box.

[20:53] <Su-Shee> I've half finished a little blog in rakudo. 

[20:53] <masak> :)

[21:02] <Su-Shee> masak: I thought, I'll anounce it on the Perl6 users ML and wrap it into a little tutorial.

[21:03] <masak> Su-Shee: whatever way you prefer, of course.

[21:04] <masak> this topic naturally interests me, since I've been writing web apps in Rakudo for almost a year, and since I'm now developing Web.pm to make it easier for people to do so.

[21:04] <Su-Shee> masak: I've read about it and I know that the I think russian guy writes a blog engine..

[21:04] <masak> Su-Shee: correct. Ilya writes Maya.

[21:06] <Su-Shee> right now, I'm mostly confused about the usage of roles.

[21:06] <masak> Su-Shee: I know the feeling...

[21:06] *** cognominal joined
[21:08] <masak> Su-Shee: as far as I understand, though, they're a way to introduce reusable behavior, but they're not (as is inheritance) restricted to a tree topology.

[21:08] <Su-Shee> if I take the keyword "does" seriously, I suddenly have more components which "do" something instead of "being" something. :)

[21:08] <masak> Su-Shee: that's not necessarily a bad sign.

[21:08] <jnthn> Su-Shee: The use of "does" is a good linguistic hing. :-)

[21:08] <jnthn> *hit

[21:08] <jnthn> ...

[21:08] <jnthn> *hint

[21:08] * jnthn hopes he recovers his typing skills before Rakudo Day tomorrow

[21:08] <Su-Shee> that's what I thought. :)

[21:09] <masak> Su-Shee: just keep things flexible and go with what feels right. :)

[21:09] * masak considers taking up a job writing an advice column on role play

[21:09] <Su-Shee> masak: right now, even to the unexperienced without handbook perl6 feels extremely fast and smooth to code. and I'm not even a computer scientist.

[21:09] <masak> Su-Shee: full ack.

[21:10] <masak> I'm not a CSist either.

[21:10] <Su-Shee> and it's _compact_ - everything is suddenly short compared to Perl 5.

[21:10] <jnthn> Su-Shee: I've talked about roles various times in presentations; you may or may not find some of my slides helpful.

[21:10] <jnthn> http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2008-yapc-eu-perl6oo.pdf is perhaps a good one to look at

[21:11] <masak> Su-Shee: at least in Ideal Perl 6, it's short...

[21:11] <jnthn> Which reminds me, I still failed to upload my slides from NPW. Gah!

[21:11] <Su-Shee> jnthn: thanks.

[21:12] <Su-Shee> masak: well I so can't wait .. :) and if I understand the features of parrot correctly, grand times are coming, I'm sure. :)

[21:12] <masak> Su-Shee: they have been for the past 9 months or so. and they just keep on coming. :)

[21:13] <masak> we're living in truly wondrous times.

[21:13] <masak> mberends: so, how about a lightning talk about proto at YAPC::EU? :)

[21:13] <Su-Shee> I've read some shorter pieces of wrapping the usal c libs in parrot to use them in rakudo and this looks extremely promising. (I think. :)

[21:14] <masak> mberends: if we start planning now, it might reach the levels of crazy that proto deserves. :P

[21:14] *** riffraff left
[21:15] <masak> Su-Shee: I would really like such an ability.

[21:15] <mberends> masak: start procrastinating, proto's perfect for a live demo!

[21:18] <masak> Su-Shee: hm, doesn't go all the way to Rakudo, though...

[21:19] <masak> mberends: it's only May... :)

[21:19] <masak> the proto logotype looks like it's on pretty strong drugs...

[21:21] <masak> 'private github'? :)

[21:22] <mberends> it's open source, build your own hub

[21:22] <masak> would that one thrash and scale badly like the public one does?

[21:22] <masak> mberends: github is closed source, I think.

[21:22] <mberends> masak: ok, that's the mock to do then

[21:23] <masak> there's still plenty of time.

[21:23] <jnthn> masak: Yes, tomorrow

[21:23] <Su-Shee> masak: HA! I found it. The most complete example I know of is the old SQLLite experiment in the parrot-source tree under "ext/"

[21:24] <masak> mberends: of course, proto will only be the eye candy for our then Actual project: a Real package manager for Perl 6. :)

[23:58] <jnthn> japhb: @rray.reverse.kv doesn't do it?
