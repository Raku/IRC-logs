[08:36] <finanalyst> azawawi: hi. 

[08:36] <finanalyst> azawawi: i have difficulty in connecting to irc.perl.org #padre from my home provider, but not from the provider in the office.

[08:37] <finanalyst> but i can connect to #perl6 without a problem

[08:37] <finanalyst> maybe a note about this somewhere in the 'more about' section? surely others may have the same situation

[08:41] <szabgab> finanalyst, that would mean the whole irc.perl.org server, right ?

[08:41] <phenny> szabgab: 17 Jul 12:48Z <moritz_> tell szabgab I notice that all your Perl 6 examples still use parens after 'if', ie 'if ($str ~~ m/\=/) {' - is there a good reason for that? or plain old habit?

[09:01] <finanalyst> azawawi: sorry i was away a bit too. just wanted to say that in mentioning irc channels, it might be good to mention mibbit.com

[09:03] <finanalyst> i did not know about mibbit.com until a couple of days ago, and i spent several hours trying to get onto #padre

[09:03] <finanalyst> it does seem to be the whole irc server

[09:04] <finanalyst> since i live in Russia, it might be that my home provider's IP set is on a black list

[09:04] <szabgab> I think on padre.perlide.org we have a link to mibbit, don't we ?

[09:04] <szabgab> or where else do you think it should be mentioned ?

[09:04] <finanalyst> i havnt checked whether #padre on mibbit

[09:07] <finanalyst> how would i use it?

[09:07] <szabgab> see also the link azawawi gave you

[14:47] <spx2> pmurias: oh ? didn't know that

[14:48] <spx2> pmurias: so what is the class of the most 'basic' object in p6 ?

[14:48] <pmurias> Object

[14:49] <pmurias> most stuff is also Any

[14:49] <spx2> so is Any an Object ?

[14:49] <pmurias> yes

[14:49] <spx2> or is Object an Any ?

[14:49] <spx2> :D

[14:49] <pmurias> most stuff being everything except junctions

[14:49] <pmurias> Object is Any+junctions

[14:50] <spx2> so Object is a class derived from Any and junctions ?

[21:04] <payload>     [Numeric] kill :Trig tag, always include trig functions.

[21:04] <payload>     Replace stupid string args with an enum.

[21:04] <payload>     Default to lexical constant $?TRIGBASE.

[21:04] <payload> rakudo is outdated :D

[21:05] <jeekobu> Ha

[21:11] <payload> deleting the (:Trig) in the definitions should work i think... compiling and testing
