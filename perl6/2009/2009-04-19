[05:13] <literal> is this supposed to autovivify?

[05:14] <literal> it does in Perl 5, which surprised me

[05:14] <pmichaud> yes, its supposed to autovivify.

[05:14] <pmichaud> It's one of our ongoing annoying bugs.

[05:18] <cspencer> pmichaud: you available to field a spec related question? :)

[05:22] <pmichaud> cspencer: sure

[05:23] <cspencer> i'm moving the trig subs from src/builtins/math.pir into Num in the setting and i'm wondering what S32 means when it says that "use Num :Trig" will install the sub names into Num::Trig

[05:23] <cspencer> i'm assuming that the :Trig flag should make sin/cos/atan etc available in the global namespace, no?

[05:23] <pmichaud> yes, fsvo "global namespace"

[05:24] <cspencer> (what's fsvo, for my future reference) :)

[05:24] <pmichaud> (for some value of)

[05:24] <cspencer> ah ok

[05:24] <pmichaud> but I'm guessing the intent is that the transcendentals aren't in the curernt setting by default;  they have to be imported

[05:25] <cspencer> yes, that's my take too

[05:25] <pmichaud> for the time being Rakudo is acting as if they're always imported, until we get import tags fully implemented

[05:25] <pmichaud> (and possibly until we get proper lexical settings)

[05:26] <cspencer> are the import tags not working?

[05:26] <cspencer> i thought that i'd had it such that :Trig would haul the subs into the calling package

[05:27] <cspencer> or do you mean in the current revision of rakudo

[05:27] <pmichaud> afaik, the import tags aren't implemented yet.

[05:27] <pmichaud> I could be wrong about that.

[05:28] <cspencer> i'm under the impression that they work for me, though i could be wrong myself :)

[05:29] <pmichaud> currently I think everything gets imported, regardless of tag.

[05:29] <pmichaud> the way to know for sure would be to try to use a trig function w/o having done "use Num :Trig".  If it fails, then perhaps tags are working.

[05:30] <pmichaud> rakudo:  say sin(3);

[05:30] <p6eval> rakudo d0310a: OUTPUT¬´0.141120008059867‚ê§¬ª

[05:30] <cspencer> oh, yes, you referring to the current builtin trig functions

[05:30] <cspencer> in my local copy i've moved them over to Num.pm with tags

[05:31] <cspencer> and that does work for me

[05:31] <pmichaud> and the above fails?

[05:31] <cspencer> yes

[05:31] <pmichaud> interesting.

[05:31] <pmichaud> I'd be very interested in seeing the patch.

[05:31] <cspencer> do you want me to do a format-patch and send it over?  it's not quite completed yet

[05:32] <pmichaud> sure... although I'm going to have to disappear in a bit

[05:32] <pmichaud> (to travel to the hackathon venue)

[05:32] <cspencer> ah, that's still on-going

[05:32] <cspencer> :

[05:32] <cspencer> i'll head to bed and send it off to you in the morning

[05:33] <pmichaud> okay, that'll be great

[05:33] <pmichaud> I already have a fairly full hackathon day scheduled :-)

[05:33] <cspencer> i was hoping to get the ability to specify degrees/radians/gradians cut in tomorrow anyways

[05:33] <pmichaud> (Lots of wonderful hacking.  Not enough hours.)

[05:33] <cspencer> heh :)

[05:34] <cspencer> alrighty then, happy hacking, i'll follow up tomorrow with a patch of some sort :)

[14:28] <LylePerl> oops

[14:28] <moritz_> there's something you can do, however

[14:28] <masak> LylePerl: what's the Q:PIR used for in this case?

[14:29] <LylePerl> Is there a way to make the test run only if it's Rakudo?

[14:29] <moritz_> you can write a Perl 6 version, fudge it by preceeding it with #?rakudo emit #

[14:29] <moritz_> and write a #?rakudo emit $yourversionhere line

[14:29] <LylePerl> masak: To check Rakudo's $*CWD matches parrots

[14:29] <pnu> masak, moritz_: Ok, i'll open that ticket if I find the spec. Or i just quote TimToady. :-)

[14:30] <masak> LylePerl: ah. well, what moritz_ said.

[14:30] <masak> pnu: the latter is faster. :)

[14:30] <moritz_> LylePerl: that's nothing you should care about, from a language perspective

[14:30] <moritz_> LylePerl: it might be better chdir somehwere, and then check $*CWD if it matches

[14:32] <moritz_> LylePerl: the tests assume that the current working directory is above t/spec/, so you could check if "$*CWD/t" exists, or so

[14:34] <masak> I swear I wasn't doing a disco dance in the second picture on http://howcaniexplainthis.blogspot.com/2009/04/group-photos.html , but I admit it sure looks that way.

[14:41] <masak> I'll see what I can do to improve it.

[14:41] <pmichaud> rakudo-specific tests don't belong in spectests

[14:41] <LylePerl> moritz_: Think I've found a bug in S05-modifier/ignorecase.t

[14:41] <pmichaud> spectests should test language features that are part of the spec.

[14:42] <LylePerl> mortiz: it uses that syntax... unless I'm missing something else

[14:42] <LylePerl> pmichaud: ok, I'll take it out

[14:42] *** azawawi left
[14:42] <moritz_> LylePerl: I think that testing for the existance of  "$*CWD/t" might be a good alternative

[14:43] <pmichaud> if we're testing something that really needs a rakudo-specific test, we can put it in rakudo's t/00-parrot directory or something similar.

[14:43] <pmichaud> but better is to just have the generic Perl 6 tests.

[18:27] <moritz_> cspencer: I guess what's killing it is its clumsyness

[18:27] <TimToady> well, the first indicator was when Gabor started his tutorial with my $x = =$*IN

[18:28] <TimToady> moritz_: maybe, or $fh.unget perhaps

[18:28] * skids will clean up S07 then.

[18:28] <TimToady> the second indicator was when we starting trying to figure out laziness, and got all tangled in the semantics of =

[21:13] <frettled> masak and I also briefly discussed the future packaging system for Perl 6 (I'm good at discussing things, it's finding time to *do* things that hurts), and we agreed that we should at least have a look at e.g. Debian's or Red Hat's package managers, our needs seem quite similar.

[21:14] <moritz_> the big difference is that .rpm and .deb distribute binary packages, we want to primarily distribute source packages

[21:14] *** skids joined
[21:14] <moritz_> that said, the dependency handling of apt/dpkg is really excellent

[21:21] <skids> does any of it have to do with viagra? :-)

[21:21] <wayland76> frettled: I've spent a fair bit of time playing with package-related stuff, and I have a theory about how we should do it.

[21:22] <wayland76> skids: "ba?lant?s?n? t?klay?n veya ba?lant? ÔøΩal??mazsa taray?c?n?z?n adres".  You tell me

[21:26] <moritz_> my build system TODO is at http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=64868

[21:29] <skids> wayland76: Turkish

[21:30] <skids> (And google will translate.)

[21:30] <s1n> moritz_: imho, rakudo should distance itself from parrot's build and require a prebuilt parrot (check the version and fail if requirement is not met), but it may still be too early for that

[21:30] <moritz_> s1n: agreed on both.

[21:31] <moritz_> right now it's just a pain

[21:31] <s1n> well, it may be a pain, but until parrot properly installs, we might have to just deal with the warts

[21:31] <moritz_> when somebody reports an error, I ask "is your parrot up to date?", then "and did you clean rakudo after you updated parrot?"

[21:31] <moritz_> at least some of the limitations right now are artificial

[21:33] <s1n> true, it should check the version to make sure it's up to date, but i really think we should start moving towards requiring parrot in the path (or win32 equiv)

[21:33] <moritz_> s1n: it's not that easy. All developers build parrot from svn, and will do so for quite a while

[21:34] <frettled> wayland76: okay, do you think we should roll our own?

[21:34] <frettled> moritz_: (woops, lost your response) yes, and it's the dependency parts that are most interesting.

[21:34] <skids> Might be worth it to have milestone-only makefile handling that uses a separate parrot.

[21:34] <frettled> moritz_: plus, perhaps, package signing

[21:34] <s1n> moritz_: i agree, it's not easy, but ultimately rakudo will not necessarily require a specific svn revision, but probably something more like a release revision

[21:35] <s1n> ultimately, this is a problem most distributors handle

[21:35] <moritz_> s1n: yes. But right now I'm not interested in ultimate or long-term solutions

[21:35] <moritz_> as long as I have to ask these questions 5 times a week

[21:35] <s1n> short term, it should keep parrot up to date when they rebuild, so yes, i agree with you

[21:39] *** dukeleto left
[21:40] <wayland76> s1n: I'm working on having a prebuilt parrot for my Rakudo RPM

[21:40] <s1n> wayland76: that's not a bad idea, but what happened to you building a parrot RPM?

[21:41] <wayland76> s1n: That's what I meant, I guess

[21:41] <wayland76> :)

[21:41] <wayland76> maybe I've used the wrong term

[21:41] <skids> parrot still broken on hw with quirky alignment rules (parisc)

[21:41] <s1n> so you'll have a parrot RPM and a rakudo RPM?

[21:41] <wayland76> That's the plan

[21:41] <s1n> wayland76: good plan :)

[21:41] <skids> Not a top priority and as I understood it a year ago, real chore to fix.

[21:41] <s1n> did you get past the whole parrot_config issue?

[21:42] <wayland76> s1n: I think so.  I've forgotten it :)

[21:42] <s1n> heh

[21:42] <s1n> wayland76: pm

[21:42] <wayland76> frettled: I think the first step in building a good packaging system is to start by working towards the idea of the P5 Software::Packager, except better :)

[21:44] <frettled> wayland76: I'd say that that depends on how quick it is to subvert an existing package system.

[21:44] <wayland76> frettled: What do you mean by that?

[21:44] <frettled> wayland76: but I do think that we need a Perl API for that anyway.

[21:44] <moritz_> I don't understand that... git-am seems to have problems with trailing carriage returns, and my dumb system patch(1) accepts these patches just fine

[21:45] <frettled> wayland76: Well, if it's a small job to use either rpm or deb to create a new package archive and dependency resolution system, then the effort of rolling our own system from scratch may not be worth it.

[21:46] <wayland76> frettled: My plan is, have one object that represents the metadata for a package, and then use that to generate debs, rpms, or whatever

[21:46] <frettled> wayland76: masak and I discussed that too, as a more of a longer term goal.

[21:47] <moritz_> I think what neither of these systems support is installing multiple versions of the same package

[21:47] <moritz_> but which is what Perl 6 is supposed to allow

[21:47] <wayland76> frettled: Well, the package that represents the metadata is easy.  I have a Perl5 one I can port (I hope), and you can work from there

[21:47] <wayland76> hmm

[21:47] <frettled> moritz_: if you by ´same packageª mean ´same package in same locationª, then no.

[21:47] <wayland76> moritz_: I'm not so sure of that

[21:47] <wayland76> I'm sure that RPM can do multiples

[21:48] <moritz_> I don't think dpkg does it

[21:48] <wayland76> because I had an x64 package that accidentally got a bunch of i386 packages installed too

[21:48] <frettled> moritz_: but you really ought to keep the package names different, like (e.g. Debian) ´apacheª and ´apache2ª

[21:48] <moritz_> wayland76: arch != version

[21:48] <wayland76> moritz_: Good point.  

[21:49] <frettled> the general idea is to have the package system handle upgrades automatically, and then the system must know whether something is an upgrade.

[21:49] <moritz_> frettled: if you encode the version into the package name, you can't say "give me any apache" without saying exactly which apache you want

[21:49] <frettled> the version number is a pretty good cue.

[21:49] <skids> generally on debian different versions go be versioned names.  Especially common in libs.

[21:49] <frettled> moritz_: well, er, yes you can.

[21:49] <frettled> moritz_: in Debian, that's specified by ´providesª

[21:49] <frettled> If they would be in conflict, you add ´conflictsª.

[21:50] <moritz_> frettled: so you'd create a package Foo and one Foo-$version, and Foo-$version provides Foo? that's... clever!

[21:50] <skids> You'd probably package a -core that is depended on by all versioned packages that sets up any dir structure used in common by the different versions.

[21:50] <frettled> So there's quite a bit of flexibility and freedom to shoot your foots off.

[21:50] <wayland76> moritz_: I personally don't care about multiple versions, but I won't install anything on my system unless it's an RPM

[21:50] <wayland76> that means that a lot of the CPAN software out there is not useful to me

[21:50] <wayland76> I'm hoping that's one thing we can fix with the Perl6 setup

[21:50] <frettled> I suppose that Debian admins would be happy as long as they get the equivalent of dh-make-perl.

[21:50] <moritz_> is there no system to convert CPAN to RPM?

[21:51] <moritz_> like dh-make-perl for debian, yes

[21:51] <wayland76> moritz_: Yes, but it doesn't always work wonderfully well

[21:51] * skids recalls years ago before dh-make-perl, trying to get ExtUtils::MakeMaker to directly gen debs.

[21:51] <wayland76> And it doesn't do dependency resolution properly for you.  So there's plenty of room for improvement.  

[21:52] <skids> I think I did get as far as deps.

[21:52] <moritz_> wayland76: which one did you try? cpan2rpm? or CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM?

[21:52] <wayland76> I think cpan2dist is moving in the right direction, but we can do better :)

[21:52] <moritz_> skids: the dh-make-perl in Lenny does dependencies pretty well

[21:53] <wayland76> moritz_: both of those.  Best results so far with either cpan2rpm or cpanspec (which is another one of the same)

[21:53] <skids> cool.

[21:53] <frettled> moritz_: it's a satisfying kind of magic, but with some caveats. :)

[21:54] *** jan_ joined
[21:54] <wayland76> But all that stuff could be integrated (as optional) into the cpan shell

[21:54] <skids> the scary part is that a decade plus later I can still type 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' faster than some english words.

[21:54] <moritz_> ;-)

[21:55] <frettled> skids: my condolences

[21:55] <LylePerl> :( I've lost the ability to build rakudo

[21:55] <LylePerl> I've tried 4 different parrot versions

[21:55] *** iblechbot left
[21:56] <LylePerl> How can I get git to rollback to previous commits?

[21:56] <moritz_> git checkout $other_version

[21:56] <moritz_> or if you want to throw away anything newere (possibly dangerous) git reset --hard $other_commit

[22:03] <LylePerl> "git checkout d208e1c" did it thanks

[22:04] <pugs_svn> r26297 | moritz++ | [t/spec] test for $*OUT.say (RT #63552)

[22:05] <wayland76> Does $*OUT.say print a stringification of $*OUT ?  

[22:05] <moritz_> no

[22:05] <moritz_> rakudo: $*OUT.say("hi")

[22:05] <p6eval> rakudo 0d5515: OUTPUT¬´hi‚ê§¬ª

[22:05] <wayland76> Inconsistency!

[22:06] <moritz_> fix!

[22:06] <skids> parrot's iterator in scalar context gives current "index", in boolean, peeks for more values.  This is not specced for $r = @a.iterator in Perl6, should it be?  I could add to S07.

[22:06] <wayland76> (A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds :) )

[22:06] <wayland76> skids: If no-one answers, ask ruoso

[22:07] <moritz_> skids: I don't think it's a good idea

[22:07] <moritz_> skids: because you can't always tell in which context your are

[22:07] <moritz_> multi f(Bool $x) { ... }; multi f(Str $x) { ... }; f($obj.iterator) # what does it do?

[22:09] <skids> We will need a peek of some sort, to allow detection before a StopIteration while keeping that iteration uniterated.  Also a test for infinite lists without evaluating the length, as per zip() spec.

[22:10] <skids> Both could be useful/synched with IO API

[22:11] <frettled> moritz_: As I understood it, f($obj.iterator) would result in no matching functions to call; the type doesn't match the multiple dispatch.

[22:11] <moritz_> frettled: why not? if $obj.iterator returns either a Bool or a Str, context sensitively?

[22:11] <moritz_> frettled: that's mostly an example why want() won't work in Perl 6

[22:11] *** cosimo left
[22:12] <skids> Though ".eof" on class Iterator would be tacky being it's not a file.

[22:13] <wayland76> Maybe we should replace eof everywhere with eos (end of stream) or something

[22:13] <frettled> moritz_: in that case, it might work iff it does so

[22:14] <moritz_> skids: a peek is fine by me (though istr that TimToady had some different ideas for that), but please not with more magic :-)

[22:14] <skids> Perhaps.  Most importantly folks working on IO API should be taught to ask "could we inherit this from Iterator"?

[22:14] <skids> moritz_: OK, fine, I'll put the tophat down :-)

[22:15] <wayland76> skids: s/inherit/compose/, surely?

[22:16] *** nsh- is now known as nsh

[22:16] <skids> Sure, I mean, whatever :-)  I'm more a bit pusher than a CS theory guy :-P

[22:17] <frettled> moritz_: but what it really depends on is what type $obj.iterator is at the time of type checking, right?  This may actually be undefined, unless it's covered by the change in strictness (where you have to specify whether the type is <rw> or not).

[22:18] <moritz_> frettled: type checking is done at dispatch time, so at time  the return type of $obj.iterator is already known, because that method has run already...

[22:18] <frettled> (the careful language is chosen because I still lack quite a bit of knowledge regarding the specs and internals)

[22:19] <moritz_> frettled: that means that the iterator() method can't know to which multi its return type will be dispatched...

[22:19] <frettled> moritz_: well, it could return different types depending on runtime conditions, couldn't it?

[22:19] <moritz_> frettled: yes, but that condition is only known *after* it returned a value

[22:19] *** PacoLinux left
[22:20] <frettled> in which case, it only loosely fits the definition, and you have A Problem.

[22:20] *** payload left
[22:20] <moritz_> right

[22:20] <skids> Ah, .eoi

[22:20] <moritz_> the problem is that want() won't work as we know it from wantarray in Perl 5

[22:20] <skids> Already specced for IO

[22:20] <frettled> From my memory of Friday's talk and yesterday's discussion, that would probably result in at least a warning.

[22:21] <moritz_> ah, it's being discussed. That's a good thing ;-)

[22:22] <moritz_> I'm quite confident that jnthn and pmichaud will move TimToady from the current, unimplementable situation to a different unimplementable idea ;-)

[22:22] <frettled> Not exactly that problem, but the problems of having multiple dispatch when the types are of equal precedence was explained by pmichaud in his Talk.  Using <rw> to define whether a type is defined loosely or strictly was discussed yesterday because of what might happen when you pass an array of a subtype to a function handling the type.

[22:24] * skids tries to figure out if people really mean $obj.iterator or $iterator.get

[22:24] <moritz_> man, why is Oslo so far away? I really should have been there

[22:24] <antiphase> The beer is very expensive

[22:25] * antiphase got back home an hour ago

[22:25] <frettled> moritz_: grab the next chance; Lisbon

[22:25] <moritz_> I don't mind the beer prices, I can live without it ;-)

[22:25] <moritz_> frettled: I'll try

[22:25] <frettled> antiphase: and my tequila sunrise cost me NOK 90-ish

[22:26] <antiphase> The beer seemed to vary between 35 and 65 NOK for a pretend pint, which is extortion

[22:27] <antiphase> I didn't get into spirits for fear of bankruptcy

[22:27] <frettled> antiphase: 35 NOK would be the 0.4l, then.  In more expensive and popular establishments, expect to pay up to 80-90 NOK for 0.5l

[22:28] <frettled> I don't drink beer, and I rarely go out for drinks, but I keep a reasonable selection of red and white wine, port, whisky, cognac, armagnac, etc.

[22:30] <frettled> moritz_: but please take what I say about the actual details of type handling with a grain of salt, I've just been a meddling observer.

[22:30] *** Bucciarati joined
[22:32] <antiphase> I need to get into helping with Perl 6, but I've no idea what yet. I've been somewhat inspired by NPW

[22:33] <frettled> you too, eh...

[22:33] <antiphase> I am but a sysadmin, without any hardcore CS knowledge

[22:36] <wayland76> antiphase: I'm a sysadmin too :)

[22:36] <frettled> o/

[22:36] <frettled> (though with the CS background)

[22:36] <wayland76> antiphase: Are you any good with build systems?

[22:36] <frettled> muahaha :D

[22:37] <wayland76> frettled: Don't do that until he says "yes" :)

[22:37] <antiphase> I'va managed to avoid them so far, but it depends what's involved... :)

[22:38] * frettled waves hand: you like to work with build systems

[22:38] <frettled> wayland76: . o O (hope that helps)

[22:38] <wayland76> Oh.  Well, Rakudo doesn't do "make install" yet :)

[22:38] <cspencer> moritz_: re: your comment on the "use Num :Trig" patch, should i apply that and push it out?

[22:39] <wayland76> And I'm in the process of working on an RPM specfile that needs that :)

[22:39] <wayland76> But I think I need to beat Parrot into a bit more submission first

[22:39] <antiphase> Are there any specific target architectures yet, or is everyone hacking it to work on their preferred OS?

[22:39] <wayland76> Actaully, maybe better wait until I've done that

[22:39] <antiphase> s/architectures/OSen/

[22:39] <wayland76> antiphase: the second :)

[22:40] <wayland76> (I presume, anyway)

[22:40] <antiphase> I'm a Debian//Ubuntu person myself

[22:40] <wayland76> Great, make a .deb :)

[22:40] <antiphase> I may investigate

[22:41] <wayland76> antiphase: Please do.  No more than investigation can be asked :)

[22:41] <frettled> Please do so, I'll be happy to test whatever packaging you do for Debian.

[22:41] <wayland76> I only know packaging because I had to learn it as a sysadmin

[22:41] *** meppl joined
[22:41] <frettled> Hey, I know packaging, too: tar czf foo.tgz foo/

[22:42] <wayland76> frettled: Unless you can remove the package after you've installed it, it doesn't count :)

[22:42] <frettled> wayland76: oh, that's _trivial_ :)

[22:43] <frettled> Encap isn't too bad, if you can stand symlink hell.

[22:43] <wayland76> (I always do "tar -czvf rakudo.tar.gz ; rpmbuild -ta rakudo.tar.gz")

[22:43] <antiphase> tar -ztvf perl6.tar.gz | xargs rm -rf

[22:44] <wayland76> antiphase: That only works if it was a binary distro, but good point :)

[22:44] <frettled> Heh, that reminds me of something I saw on a slide on Friday: chown -R dir/

[22:44] <frettled> woops, chown -R user dir/

[22:44] *** payload joined
[22:44] <frettled> scary

[22:45] <wayland76> I've done that in the last week

[22:45] <frettled> hopefully on directories where you have complete control over and knowledge of the contents.

[22:45] <antiphase> They could at least have used user: to set the group as well

[22:45] <wayland76> I got a new Netbook and the user ID didn't match the one on my server, so NFS wasn't working.  So I changed my UID in /etc/passwd, and then did chown wayland /home/wayland :)

[22:45] <wayland76> Oh, yeah, I guess I did that too :)

[22:46] <frettled> I never do chown -R on directories that I didn't make the contents in myself, and even if I did, I check carefully where the symlinks point.

[22:46] <wayland76> Actually, I'm wrong

[22:46] <sjn> frettled: go to bed :)

[22:47] <frettled> sjn: sssssh...

[22:47] <wayland76> I did find . -user 1000 -exec chown wayland '{}' \;

[22:47] <frettled> mm

[22:47] <wayland76> So, good point, it is scary :)

[22:47] <Bucciarati> fwiw, there is chown -h

[22:48] <frettled> Anyway, the safer command line option set is:  -Rh (to avoid dereferencing symlinks, e.g. to /, so that you don't accidentally change ownership of entire file systems)

[22:48] *** meppl left
[22:48] <frettled> I tend to use find . -user foo -print0 | xargs -0 chown bar:

[22:49] <frettled> (depending on the situation, of course)

[22:50] <wayland76> I use cp -R dir otherdir ; rm dir ; mv otherdir dir

[22:50] <wayland76> :)

[22:50] <wayland76> :-} <-- evil grin 

[22:50] <frettled> >:->

[22:50] <s1n> wayland76: missing a -r from that rm command?

[22:51] <wayland76> s1n: No, I don't think so.  I'm making a *real* mess with that :)

[22:51] <wayland76> (actually, good point :) )

[22:51] <s1n> surprised it did it without complaining

[22:52] <frettled> wayland76: how about mv tar cSf - dir | (mv dir{,.old} && su user -c 'tar xSf -')

[22:53] <wayland76> mv tar would be a bit confusing :)

[22:54] <frettled> wayland76: you _could_ try sending system(...)

[22:54] <frettled> :]

[22:54] <wayland76> frettled: I thought you were trying to do something that looks kinda right, but creates a mess ;)

[22:54] <frettled> wayland76: oh, no, I was just going for obscure solution wanking.

[22:56] <wayland76> frettled: Ok, but don't admit you were wrong :)  Like when s1n pointed out about my missing -r :)

[22:56] <wayland76> (if we were being serious, I'd be the first to admit I'm wrong :) )

[22:56] <frettled> Were we being serious?  I hope not.

[22:57] <frettled> I have used the tar cSf - foo | tar xSf - trick via SSH, though.

[22:57] <wayland76> No.  Hence the "if" :)

[22:58] <wayland76> :)

[22:59] <frettled> tar cSzf - foo | uuencode | sendmail [email@hidden.address]
[23:00] <frettled> (okay, so uuencode needs parameters, but who cares)

[23:01] <frettled> I'll take sjn's hint now and go to bed before someone bludgeons me to death.  Good night.

[23:02] * skids sighs and begins the long process of putting his bludgeon back in its case.

[23:04] <wayland76> skids: You could take it to #perl :)

[23:04] <Bucciarati> hey I want to start hacking on Rakudo, I picked a bug that looks simple http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=64566 .  I can reproduce it and I think the test for that would go in t/01-sanity/07-range.t

[23:04] <wayland76> And ask for help, or when perl6 will be done

[23:04] <Bucciarati> > my @a=1..4; say @a.elems

[23:04] <Bucciarati> 4

[23:04] <Bucciarati> > my @a=1..4; say @a[0..*].elems

[23:04] <Bucciarati> 5

[23:04] <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `='

[23:05] <Bucciarati> (btw is this the right place?)

[23:05] <Bucciarati> (I mean is this discussion relevant to this IRC channel?)

[23:05] <wayland76> Bucciarati: It's the right place, but I'm just the channel clown, so I can't answer your question :)

[23:06] <wayland76> s/clown/court jester/ :)

[23:10] *** nihiliad left
[23:12] <pmichaud> Bucciarati: The [0..*] construct isn't cleanly supported in Rakudo yet.

[23:12] <Bucciarati> fine with me :)  I just hope there's someone willing to show me around the code (developer guide on parrot.org is not very comprehensive) and maybe hint at where I may go looking for the place where rakudo misbehaves

[23:12] <pmichaud> in particular,  Rakudo  thinks that  @a[0..*]  is the same as  @a[0..4]

[23:13] <eiro> so @a 

[23:13] <pmichaud> (which is why it does 5 elements)

[23:13] <pmichaud> anyway, it's a bug that is high on our list to repair soon.

[23:14] <eiro> (hello world)

[23:14] <Bucciarati> pmichaud: yes it's clear, that made me think it's a quick bug to fix and a nice excuse to go exploring the code

[23:14] <pmichaud> it's not a quick bug, alas.

[23:15] <Bucciarati> er.  ok :)

[23:15] <s1n> Bucciarati: pmichaud has stated that there are no quick bugs/features left :)

[23:15] <cspencer> pmichaud: have you had the chance to look at the trig patch i'd sent in earlier?

[23:15] <pmichaud> The postcircumfix:<[ ]> operator has to be refactored so that it knows how to handle a Range argument

[23:15] <pmichaud> in particular, it has to know how to handle a Range where one or the other endpoints is a Whatever object

[23:16] <pmichaud> cspencer: no, I haven't -- the hackathon here has kept me _very_ busy.  

[23:16] <cspencer> pmichaud: that's understandable :)

[23:16] <pmichaud> jnthn++ and I are currently updating Rakudo's roadmap.  Ealier today we finally got some details on handling laziness; including eliminating the icky prefix:<=> op.

[23:19] <s1n> pmichaud: back in town yet?

[23:19] <cspencer> pmichaud: there were a couple of details i'd wanted to ask you about regarding it, but i'll wait till you've had a chance to look first :)

[23:19] <pmichaud> s1n: no, still in oslo.
