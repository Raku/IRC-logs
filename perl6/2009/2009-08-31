[06:49] <wayland76> Incidentally, I've noticed on the topic of threading that there seem to be two basic opinions floating around.  

[06:50] <wayland76> One is to do what is briefly mentioned in S17 at the moment, and have an events-underlying-threads model (which is the one I favour)

[06:50] <wayland76> But the other model seems to be advocated by people who think POSIX threads are where it's at

[06:51] <wayland76> My understanding is that the POSIX-threads people say that the events-threads stuff requires that the threads co-operate somehow

[07:38] <sjohnson> hi Su-Shee and wayland, and others

[07:39] * KatrinaTheLamia huggles sjohnson

[07:39] <Tene> japhb: Sorry for the delay.  I finally added eval to nqp.  It's pretty basic, and the language you're evaling needs to follow HLL interop conventions.

[07:39] <pmichaud> Tene: is eval implemented as a keyword?

[07:39] <japhb> Tene, Thank you!

[07:40] <pmichaud> or as a library?

[07:40] <Tene> pmichaud: compilers/nqp/src/builtins.pir

[07:40] <japhb> Hopefully will be able to do more Plumage hacking next week, $day_job permitting

[07:40] <pmichaud> oh.

[07:40] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmm.. I could see it being used as a library as being useful.

[07:41] <pmichaud> I'm trying to keep the number of builtin functions really small.  But I might be able to accept eval for now.

[07:41] <pmichaud> (no, I'm not about to back it out... just thinking what I would like instead, if anything)

[07:41] * sjohnson hugs KatrinaTheLamia back :3

[07:41] <KatrinaTheLamia> particularly is eval had more object behaviour than keyword behaviour... seriously, I could think of some interesting ideas for an eval object.

[07:41] <Tene> pmichaud: I have no attachment to it whatsoever.  Just the simplest thing that could possibly work.  I'll re-do it to comply with whatever feedback you give me.

[07:42] <japhb> Su-Shee, one thing I noticed is that the less saturated mockup of the perl6.org front page also didn't wrap weirdly like perl6.org (used?) to.

[07:42] <pmichaud> okay.

[07:42] <pmichaud> I hadn't thought about it as builtins.pir, but I think that's likely okay for now.

[07:42] <Tene> I don't really understand the layout of nqp very well anyway, but I didn't want to delay any longer. :)

[07:43] <wayland76> hugme: hug KatrinaTheLamia and sjohnson

[07:43] * hugme hugs KatrinaTheLamia

[07:43] <japhb> pmichaud, seems best to minimize the keyword count in NQP, I would think.

[07:43] <wayland76> hugme: hug  sjohnson

[07:43] <pmichaud> Tene++  # excellent job, btw

[07:43] <wayland76> Hugs by proxy :)

[07:43] <pmichaud> yes, I want to keep the keyword count low in NQP

[07:43] <moritz_> japhb: there were tweeks to the other (non-color) parts of the perl6.org layout recently. Maybe the decoloured version doesn't have these fixes yet

[07:43] <Tene> japhb: you talked about json... is there a json compiler that exists as a language?

[07:43] <pmichaud> well, more to the point, I don't want NQP to have keywords that aren't also keywords in Perl 6 :)

[07:43] <cognominal> jnthn, are your around?

[07:43] <KatrinaTheLamia> wayland76: you made a bot specifically for the purpose of hugging? BRAVO!

[07:44] <Tene> I see compilers/json/, but that doesn't get installed as a language.

[07:44] <wayland76> No, I didn't.  But it's there

[07:44] <wayland76> But I might've just broken it :/

[07:44] <moritz_> KatrinaTheLamia: no. The primary purpose is of hugme is to add contributors to projects

[07:44] <KatrinaTheLamia> bad wayland76... no cookie for you.

[07:44] <japhb> Tene, yes, I believe that the existing JSON reader is implemented as a language.  But I hadn't tried to use it yet.  I don't know why it's not installed ....

[07:44] <moritz_> hugme: list projects

[07:44] <hugme> moritz_: I know about these projects: json, perl6-examples, proto, svg-matchdumper, svg-plot, tufte

[07:45] <moritz_> hugme: help

[07:45] <hugme> moritz_: 'hugme: (add $who to $project | list projects | hug $nickname)'

[07:45] <KatrinaTheLamia> moritz_: ah... okay...

[07:45] <KatrinaTheLamia> hugme add KatrinaTheLamia to SSBZ

[07:45] <hugme> KatrinaTheLamia: sorry, I don't know anything about project 'SSBZ'

[07:45] <wayland76> hugme: hug sjohnson

[07:45] * hugme hugs sjohnson

[07:45] <Tene> japhb: compilers/json certainly doesn't get installed as a language.

[07:45] <wayland76> ok, it works now :)

[07:46] <KatrinaTheLamia> hmmm... well, I suppose I need to register SSBZ somewhere >.>

[07:46] <japhb> Tene, I was agreeing with you.  I was just saying I didn't happen to know *why* that was the case.  :-)

[07:46] <Tene> Ah. :)

[07:47] <Tene> japhb: likely because there are few people that know anything about hll interop, and json doesn't look like it's seen work in ages, so has been inherited from a time before that mattered.

[07:47] <japhb> ah so.

[07:48] <KatrinaTheLamia> moritz_: where do I go to add a project... I mean, I won't be listing SSBZ for a little bit (due to procrastination), but it would be nice to have people interested in it.. apart from "that crazy fan game Katrina is doing"

[07:48] <moritz_> KatrinaTheLamia: where do you want to list it? is a Perl 6 project?

[07:51] <KatrinaTheLamia> Well, SSBZ was originally a Ruby project that I really got no where on (I don't think I got any actual coding done on it). Then I read up on Perl 6, and figured, that it would do nice on Perl 6. Especially since I don't expect it to be really mature any time soon. I mostly got the idea from the Iron Man blogs that Perl5 and Perl6 need more games for them. For Perl5 I am working on KREPES (Kid Radd Engine Project Existance System, I

[07:52] *** kidd joined
[07:52] <moritz_> (truncated after "System, I")

[07:53] <KatrinaTheLamia> I think the acronym ended up as..) and for Perl6 I decided to have house SSBZ.

[07:53] <KatrinaTheLamia> heh... I really hate it when clients do that >.>

[07:53] <moritz_> anyway, if you want to add your project to the "proto" installer, just tell me or masak the URL of the project, and one of us will add it

[07:53] <moritz_> (or anyone of the 100 other proto comitters :-)

[07:54] <KatrinaTheLamia> proto installer? Okay... is that the base distribution of Perl6... or is that some sort of package management system for Perl 6?

[07:55] <moritz_> it's the prototype of a package management in Perl 6

[07:57] <KatrinaTheLamia> well, I am still new to most of you gits ~.^

[08:00] <japhb> Who was going to work on private attribute declaration in NQP?  Was that Tene or jnthn?

[08:00] <Tene> It wasn't me.

[08:00] <japhb> All right, jnthn then.

[08:01] <Tene> japhb: does that eval look sufficient for your purposes for now?

[08:09] <Tene> Will commits be sufficient for your curiosity, or do you want blog posts too?

[08:09] <pmichaud> I always prefer blog posts, because (1) publicity is good and (2) others will read blogs

[08:12] <pmichaud> at YAPC::EU there was a "Space Invaders" demo written in Perl 5 SDL.  I've been wondering what it would take to make a Perl 6 version of it :)

[08:13] <moritz_> tuits, mostly

[08:13] <Tene> it ran very very slowly.

[08:13] <pmichaud> yeah, I saw that it was done, and that it was really slow

[08:13] <pmichaud> that's something we could probably work on over time :)

[08:13] <pmichaud> http://github.com/domm/Game-PerlInvaders/

[08:16] <Tene> He used some custom patches to parrot's SDL, iirc.  I'll see about merging those back into the appropriate place.

[10:42] <moritz_> oh hai masak

[10:42] <masak> o/

[10:44] <moritz_> now that we have muted colors on perl6.org, can we go back to a white background?

[10:46] <masak> we can try.

[10:46] <wayland76> ...and <blink> tags? :)

[10:46] *** szabgab left
[10:46] <masak> @slap wayland76 

[10:46] * lambdabot puts on her slapping gloves, and slaps wayland76

[10:46] <moritz_> wayland76: hush

[10:46] <wayland76> hugme: hug everyone

[10:46] * hugme hugs everyone

[10:47] *** carlin left
[10:47] <masak> a long-time proponent of milder colours on that page, I must say I like this colour scheme much better than the previous.

[10:48] <pugs_svn> r28129 | moritz++ | [perl6.org] now that we have muted colors, use white background again

[10:48] <pugs_svn> r28129 | If you think this screams at you too much, feel free to revert this commit.

[10:49] <moritz_> ok, site updated

[10:49] <sharada> hey it's got round rectangles!!

[10:49] <sharada> this is really Perl 6.0

[10:50] <masak> there's something wrong with the Ironman Part of the twitter feed perlnews. it keeps repeating mst's early ironman posts.

[10:51] <masak> s/P/p/

[10:51] <moritz_> so does the ironman website, no?

[10:52] *** iblechbot left
[10:55] <masak> dunno.

[10:56] <masak> yes.

[10:56] <masak> maybe something wrong with mst's feed?

[10:56] <svarg> whats with the camelia spokesbug

[10:57] <masak> what about it?

[10:57] <moritz_> it's our logo

[10:57] <svarg> logo for perl6?

[10:57] <moritz_> aye

[10:57] <svarg> erm

[10:57] <moritz_> "erm", it's not macho enough?

[10:57] <svarg> is that the final logo?

[10:58] * masak thinks it's macho enough

[10:58] <moritz_> svarg: nothing in Perl 6 is really final yet

[10:58] <masak> svarg: I think no-one would complain if you tried your hand at making a logo to your liking.

[10:59] <svarg> ok

[10:59] <svarg> let's see what i can come up with

[10:59] <svarg> the page looks nice, straight to the point

[11:00] <carlin> an alternative logo would be nice (not to replace camelia but as an alternative)

[11:00] <svarg> an alteernative? no, that'd be of no use

[11:01] <svarg> camelia is not the final piece right so why not try something else?

[11:01] <wayland76> svarg: No-one may complain, but there will be bikeshedding :)

[11:01] <moritz_> svarg: we have multiple implementations - why not multiple logos? :-)

[11:02] <svarg> ok what do you need logos for?

[11:02] <carlin> Camelia is nice from a fun and friendly perspective, one from a clean and professional perspective would be good

[11:02] <moritz_> svarg: to put it up on websites, mostly

[11:02] <moritz_> or on books, if you write them

[11:02] <svarg> camelia is friendly and fun but this is perl, you want to keep it a lil more reserved?

[11:03] <svarg> moritz_: yeah but i mean what kinda logos do you require

[11:03] <moritz_> svarg: we have a logo. The question is what kind of logo *you* want

[11:03] <moritz_> for Perl 6

[11:03] <svarg> ok

[11:04] <svarg> camelia is the only perl6 logo you have now righ?

[11:04] <svarg> i'll work on an alternative

[11:04] <moritz_> rakudo has a logo, but it's only for rakudo itself, not for Perl 6

[11:05] <moritz_> http://rakudo.org/sites/default/files/logo.png

[11:05] <svarg> you want an alternative for rakudo as well?

[11:05] <moritz_> I have no idea; if one falls out of the other efforts, it might be nice. But in the end that's pmichaud's decision

[11:06] <svarg> alright i'll work on something, show it you in a day or two

[11:06] <wayland76> Well, there was an alternative to the Perl 6 logo, but it was a nightmare

[11:07] <masak> svarg: the question 'you want an alternative for rakudo as well?' presupposes the (false) image of one single coherent group of people all wanting the same thing. :)

[11:07] <wayland76> IIRC, it had a couple of lion pictures stolen from the 'Net, with the slogan "Parallel lions never meet" or something :)

[11:07] <masak> wayland76: you're just making that up. :P

[11:07] *** flip913 joined
[11:07] <wayland76> masak: No, this is true -- I made it myself :)

[11:07] <masak> ah :)

[11:08] <flip913> If I've got a class with (eg) an array of somethings in it, can I pass its Iterator role as the one of the class? Ie. so that iterating over the class object does iterate over the array in it.

[11:08] <flip913> Without re-defining all the methods needed for the Iterator role, that is.

[11:08] <wayland76> Yes

[11:09] <wayland76> I don't know if it's implemented

[11:09] <moritz_> http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=544399 # ITP: rakudo -- implementation of Perl 6 for Parrot

[11:09] <masak> probably not implemented, no.

[11:09] <wayland76> But you do class Bar does Iterator {} class foo { has $!Bar handles ??? }

[11:09] <wayland76> I think

[11:10] <wayland76> But not ???

[11:10] <wayland76> That's me forgetting what goes there

[11:11] <wayland76> Try S12 for more info

[11:11] <moritz_> or S07

[11:11] <moritz_> but most of that really isn't implemented in Rakudo right now

[11:11] <svarg> masak: heh, im sure there's going to be a difference in opinion but let me get started on it and show it to you

[11:11] <wayland76> But you do class Bar does Iterator {} class foo { has $!Bar handles Iterator; }

[11:11] <wayland76> That's how it goes

[11:12] <flip913> wayland76: that's it? 'handles' ... I'll have to look at that.

[11:12] <masak> svarg: there's always a difference in opinion. that just means people care. that's a good thing.

[11:12] <wayland76> It can do methods or roles or regexes that match methods :)

[11:12] * wayland76 loves handles

[11:12] <svarg> masak: exactly, criticism might ask me to do more of them

[11:13] <svarg> ask/force

[11:13] <moritz_> in scruffy (ruby) I found this curious piece of code:

[11:13] <moritz_> rendertime_renderer.instance_eval { before_render if respond_to?(:before_render) }

[11:14] <moritz_> can I translate that to $rendertime_renderer.?before_render ?

[11:18] <svarg> whats the caption for perl 6?

[11:19] <svarg> does it have one?

[11:19] <moritz_> I don't think there's one

[11:19] <svarg> do you need one?

[11:19] <moritz_> so far I haven't found one that does Perl 6 justice

[11:20] *** donaldh left
[11:20] <svarg> ok you wont be needing then? :P

[11:20] <svarg> if you guys need it let me know

[11:21] *** donaldh joined
[11:21] <carlin> Perl 6: Now with more ways to do it

[11:21] <moritz_> well, having one wouldn't be bad

[11:21] <moritz_> I was recently looking for something to put in perl6.org's <title> tag

[11:21] <moritz_> and I ended up just writing 'Perl 6'

[11:21] <svarg> ok

[11:22] <svarg> k will work something out

[11:22] *** flip913 left
[11:22] <moritz_> hey, what about "Perl 6 - your friendly programming language"?

[11:23] <moritz_> now let the bikeshedding begin!

[11:23] <svarg> for the title tag i guess just perl6 will do:)

[11:23] <wayland76> svarg: If you want ideas, there was a long discussion about logos on the perl6-language mailing list

[11:23] <wayland76> moritz_: Goes well with the Camelia theme :)

[11:24] <svarg> yeah wanted to see some examples of logos previously done and rejected

[11:25] <moritz_> I think I have link somewhere in one of my tidings posts

[11:25] <moritz_> let me see if I can find it

[11:25] <svarg> yeah please

[11:25] <svarg> thanks

[11:26] <moritz_> http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2009/03/msg31263.html

[11:26] <moritz_> the rest of the thread might also be of interest to you

[11:28] <svarg> wxactly what i wa slooking for

[11:28] <svarg> thx

[11:28] <moritz_> you're welcome

[11:29] *** zamolxes left
[11:32] <svarg> oh you will need to duplicate this in ascii as well?

[11:32] <svarg> challenging

[11:32] <svarg> heh

[11:33] <moritz_> I think the ASCII-part is not so essential

[11:33] <svarg> from that perspective camelia looks nice

[11:33] <svarg> thats cool makes it more interesting, i'll do an ascii version

[11:34] <svarg> for rakudo whats your ascii version? just the japanese fonts?

[11:38] <wayland76> Hmm.  I tried making a version of camelia-in-a-suit

[11:39] <moritz_> http://slashdot.org/submission/1063859/Perl-6-gets-a-new-homepage somebody tried to /. me

[11:39] <moritz_> now I'm truly impressed

[11:40] <carlin> moritz_: :) I think it's been skipped over though :(

[11:41] <moritz_> aye, thankfully. I don't think my server could have handled that.

[11:41] <wayland76> I tried to slashdot myself once.  It didn't work :)

[11:42] <Su-Shee> well at least I won't be famous on slashdot for candy-pink and gay web style. ;)

[11:42] *** SmokeMachine joined
[11:44] <moritz_> there are worse things to become famous for

[11:45] * wayland76 thinks of Michael Jackson

[11:45] <Su-Shee> hence the ;) - in 5 days noone cares anymore anyway. 

[11:46] <moritz_> but the 5 days of traffic are enough to throw you out of google adsense :-)

[11:50] <Su-Shee> moritz_: aeh, ooookeyyyy. :)) I would have thought so too. :)

[11:51] <Su-Shee> I could change my meta to a better connection of "soap making" and "perl 6"...

[11:53] <Su-Shee> (whenever I read certain thread I really get the impression that people see perl 6 as a personal affront...)

[11:53] *** sharada left
[11:56] <carlin> the same thing happened with Python 2 vs 3. PHP 4 vs 5.

[11:56] <carlin> It's the internet :) You could find people who see kittens as a personal affront if you tried hard enough :/

[11:57] <Su-Shee> that's true.. but I really don't get not being able to laissez faire..

[12:19] <pugs_svn> r28130 | colomon++ | [t/spec] Update power.t to have real plan, un-todo stuff that now works in Rakudo, todo test that doesn't work (and may be incorrect, IMO). 

[12:21] <colomon> moritz_: How do you add test files to make spectest?  I don't think I ever got power.t properly included...

[12:21] <moritz_> colomon: that can only be done in the rakudo repo

[12:22] <colomon> moritz_: Where?  I need to add the new rat.t i just created too, I'll make a patch with both...

[12:23] <moritz_> colomon: t/spectest.data

[12:24] <colomon> moritz_++

[12:25] <moritz_> colomon++ # actually doing stuff

[12:27] <colomon> BTW, on the plan * stuff -- agree that it shouldn't be long term, but it's super handy when making a lot of changes on a test file.

[12:27] <colomon> I'd be willing to help try to toughen the test-counting code to deal with it, too.

[12:28] <moritz_> colomon: writing a simple Perl 5 script that counts the tests and add that to the test suite would be a help

[12:29] <moritz_> I agree that 'plan *' is handy, and we shouldn't let minor toolchain problems prevent us from using it

[12:31] <colomon> Is there a reason you can't just run the .t script and get the number of tests reported?  plan * still gives that info...

[12:31] <moritz_> well, that works only if the test can actually be run

[12:32] <colomon> Actually, it would have to be the make test equiv, wouldn't it?

[12:32] <colomon> But I would think checking tests that don't run in is a much bigger sin....

[12:33] *** reqamst left
[12:34] <moritz_> most tests that aren't run are actually wrong anway

[12:34] <moritz_> I tried it a few times, but it's nearly impossible to write more than a handful of trivial patches for NYI-features

[14:31] * masak rolls eyes

[14:32] <mberends> masak: during our last discussion we were toying with whether sudo would be required for installs, and istr you were warm to the idea of a modules directory somewhere under $HOME

[14:32] <masak> yes.

[14:32] <masak> that seems to be the proto way to me, after some pondering.

[14:32] * mberends is warm to that too

[14:32] <DanielC> jaffa8: It comes from the saying that it is easier to agree on the design of a nuclear power plant than on how to make the bike shed.

[14:33] <DanielC> jaffa8: For the power plant people will just nod their heads and agree with whatever you put down. But a bike shed is an easy project so everyone wants to have their say.

[14:34] <mberends> masak: re-using a previous design guideline, the module directory should survive even if proto is removed

[14:34] <masak> dang, I could use a LAST block right now.

[14:35] <Juerd> At Hacking At Random 2009 the workshop building was called "the bikeshed" and had four rooms: yellow, green, red, blue.

[14:35] <masak> mberends: yes. definitely.

[14:35] <masak> mberends: so maybe we shouldn't name it something-with-proto.

[14:35] <moritz_> $PREFIX/lib/

[14:36] <masak> aye.

[14:36] <mberends> some people are discussing Perl 6 modules only (eg Rakudo, Pugs) and others are thinking Parrot modules.

[14:36] <mberends> moritz_: yes

[14:36] <moritz_> so the question is what is $PREFIX?

[14:36] <mberends> masak++ decides

[14:37] <mberends> something after $HOME

[14:37] <jaffa8> can anyone modify pugs?

[14:37] <moritz_> jaffa8: anyone with a commit bit can

[14:37] <masak> $HOME/.ecosystem/lib, perhaps?

[14:37] <jaffa8> Does anyone understand it code?

[14:37] <masak> both Perl 6 and Parrot use 'ecosystem'.

[14:38] <masak> jaffa8: I understand a little.

[14:38] <moritz_> jaffa8: probably audreyt does, mostly

[14:38] <moritz_> and others to various degrees

[14:38] <jaffa8> Is pugs faster than Rakudo?

[14:39] <moritz_> dunno

[14:39] <jaffa8> I mean compilation speed

[14:39] <masak> jaffa8: try both of them and compare. :)

[14:39] <jaffa8> I could not compile pugs

[14:39] <masak> in that case, Rakudo is faster :)

[14:39] <moritz_> :-)

[14:40] <jaffa8> I got stuck with ridicolous problem

[14:40] <mberends> masak: .ecosystem resonates well with Plumage (security certificate expired) https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModuleEcosystem

[14:40] <jaffa8> the setup could not find a header file

[14:40] <masak> mberends: exactly.

[14:41] <masak> and it probably doesn't collide with anything else.

[14:41] <jaffa8> I specified the path of the header file with -I switch but it had no effect

[14:41] <jaffa8> Is anyone familiar with this?

[14:41] <masak> jaffa8: sorry to hear that. were audreyt here, she could probably help you.

[14:42] <jaffa8> it is a dream.

[14:42] <jaffa8> what is the chance of that?

[14:45] <mberends> jaffa8: only a tiny chance. the -I option is probably not being passed to the subcommand that needs it. how about copying the header file to another directory that _is_ being used for header files?

[14:45] <jaffa8> I wonder what directories are used.

[14:46] <jaffa8> I do not know what directories are used.

[14:46] <mberends> dunno, it might take you an interesting while to find it in the sources.

[14:47] <jaffa8> pugs seems to have a better design

[14:47] <jaffa8> it can produce all kind of output.

[14:47] <jaffa8> javascript.

[14:47] <mberends> masak: .ecosystem it is then

[14:47] <masak> jaffa8: pugs has been in development for some time.

[14:48] <jaffa8> but I guess rakudo can only output PIR

[14:48] <masak> mberends: I half-fear the tuits needed to do the shift. I suppose fear is the wrong type of anticipation, but that's how it feels. any ideas how to lessen the blow?

[15:43] <pmichaud> frettled: he'd probably curse you for it.

[15:43] <frettled> haha :D

[15:43] <masak> my advice would be to run the test suite while refactoring. then it should be a piece of cake.

[15:43] <frettled> mm

[15:43] * frettled places the idea on the ToDo list of learning :D

[15:44] <diakopter> can p6eval pull/use a .pm from a url?

[15:45] <frettled> that looks like something that shouldn't be permitted, and definitely not in safe mode

[15:45] <DanielC> masak: I very much doubt that jaffa8 is anything but a troll. It is absurd to take one comment on IRC and declare that someone doesn't know himself. In my case the claim is particularly absurd, but you'd have to know me well to know that (I spend a lot of time in introspection).

[15:46] <DanielC> masak: I *can* talk at great length about myself, my motivations and my inner mind, but I will not waste my time with a random troll on IRC.

[15:48] <masak> DanielC: you'll have to excuse me for intruding into the situation. events lately have made me interested in social IRC/blog dynamics. I personally don't believe that jaffa8 is a troll, but I'm still open to new impressions.

[15:48] <masak> DanielC: I do, however, believe that he managed (unwittingly) to insult you, and I do understand why.

[15:49] <sjohnson> morning all

[15:49] <jaffa8> DanielC: My statement were inaccurate. there seem to be a lack of knowledge about yourself in certain area. Sometimes I forget about distances that separate people. I could also noticed that I stopped talking to you before this.

[15:49] <DanielC> masak: It's not so much about insult. I just have better things to do with my time than justify my motivations to a random person on IRC.

[15:50] <masak> DanielC: aye, that too.

[15:50] <jaffa8> DanielC: why did not you just say so?

[15:50] <masak> jaffa8: I think it's all about protocol and context. there are some things you can say to strangers, and some things you can't.

[15:51] <frettled> jaffa8: it should not be necessary to say so.  This is an IRC channel about Perl 6, and when people don't want to discuss themselves here, they certainly shouldn't be pressured into doing so.

[15:51] <masak> jaffa8: "I think you do not know yourself" would be one of the things you can't.

[15:51] <frettled> Can we get back to being cozy and cuddly regarding Perl 6, Rakudo, Parrot etc. now?  :D

[15:51] <masak> oki! \o/

[15:52] <jaffa8> frettled: who is pressured? noone is forced to answer a question.

[15:52] <DanielC> jaffa8: Rather, you have seem to have a very naive and narrow-minded view. It takes a certain amount of maturity and knowledge to know the limits of understanding. When I was young I was naive like you, and I thought I knew myself better than I do. With time I learned to be more humble about what I think I know.

[15:53] <DanielC> jaffa8: It is then really absurd that you would then come and tell me that I don't know myself.

[15:55] <masak> DanielC: are you sure this fellow did not insult you?

[15:55] <masak> seems to me he hit a nerve.

[17:19] <masak> some rain, but quite a bit of sun too.

[17:19] <jnthn> Aye. I'd enjoyed good weather up at Abisko the couple of days before I went there.

[17:20] <jnthn> And I had quite nice weather in Stockholm the days after Ostersund.

[17:44] <colomon> Any advice for adding a sub in class namespace?  I've coded a simple GCD calculation function for Rat, but I'd rather not pollute the global namespace with it.

[17:47] <moritz_> my sub gcd ...

[17:47] <moritz_> although I had troubles with lexical subs in the setting

[17:47] <moritz_> colomon: you can also put it in Rat.new

[17:48] <colomon> local subs can be defined in methods?

[17:48] <moritz_> that's not what I meant

[17:48] <moritz_> I meant that you just can put the logic into the new() method

[17:49] <colomon> moritz_: sure, but that strikes me as inelegant.  :)

[17:49] <colomon> let me try my sub first and see how that works.

[17:49] <moritz_> colomon: why? Rat is defined to be immutable

[17:50] <moritz_> so whenever you change something, you have to create a new Rat

[17:50] <colomon> Good point.

[17:50] <moritz_> so you can put the simplification logic in there anyway

[17:50] <colomon> Still, I think I just like simple functions.  :)

[17:50] <colomon> Think I just discovered that Rat - doesn't work yet.

[17:51] <colomon> (Adding tests while I wait for my C++ code to compile.)

[17:51] <moritz_> colomon: anyway, your next patch should add yourself to CREDITS

[17:51] <colomon> I haven't done that anywhere yet.  ;)

[17:51] <moritz_> (rakudo patch, I mean)

[17:52] <colomon> I think pmichaud++ got a little carried away with the cutting and pasting in Rat -- subtraction operator is just the addition operator again with a different name.

[18:00] <colomon> Okay, got my sub gcd working.  Give me a minute or two to sort things out and then check them in.

[18:00] <masak> TimToady: that might be a wise idea. to me, it doesn't look drab, it looks like someone who knows which colors can go together picked the colors.

[18:00] <TimToady> I know, we'll tweek the colors depending on whether they say perl6.org, perl6.com, perl.info, etc :)

[18:01] <masak> :)

[18:01] <moritz_> perl6.biz is black and white, then

[18:01] <frettled> perl6.name is what?  :D

[18:01] <masak> perl6.info will have a fixed-width green font on black background, and no graphics.

[18:01] <frettled> perl6.com will have Flash?

[18:01] <masak> no please no

[18:02] <TimToady> well, Camelia can change the colors of her wings at will

[18:02] <Su-Shee> I take the Oz-version though I doubt that those colors are possible on computers. ;) 

[18:03] <TimToady> also, one other quibble I have is that people keep using the "patches welcome" meme, but this is true only to a certain extent

[18:03] <TimToady> Camelia is fairly non-negotiable by now

[18:03] <moritz_> TimToady: patches welcome to fix that ;-)

[18:03] <moritz_> SCNR

[18:03] <pmichaud> we do need a link to a page that describes Camelia a bit better

[18:03] <moritz_> aye

[18:03] <pmichaud> just a sec

[18:03] <pmichaud> (fixing)

[18:04] <TimToady> Editorial policy can't easily be decided by committee

[18:04] <pmichaud> ...but it can be published, which makes discussions on the topic a bit easier

[18:04] <TimToady> troo

[18:04] <frettled> Groo's clever twin?

[18:05] <pmichaud> right now there's no published policy, so it's easy to say "anything goes" even though it really doesn't

[18:05] <TimToady> any twin of Groo's would be clever by comparison

[18:06] <frettled> pmichaud: Yep.  A published policy would be nice to point towards.

[18:06] <TimToady> pugs/misc/camelia.txt was a start on that

[18:07] <pmichaud> hmm.  I tried making "Camelia" (in the header text) a link to camelia.txt, but it doesn't visually look right.

[18:07] <pmichaud> maybe a link from "butterflies" instead

[18:08] <moritz_> or or just the first Camelia

[18:08] *** Woody2143 left
[18:08] <TimToady> another thing that should be pointed out is that this is just the Perl 6 logo, not necessarily the logo of any distribution of Perl 6.

[18:09] <TimToady> Red Hat and Ubuntu don't use Tux.

[18:09] <TimToady> also, the complaint that it looks juvenile is quite accurate, because it's *intended* to look that way as a sign of renewed youth

[18:10] <moritz_> pmichaud: looks good

[18:10] <moritz_> s/good/fine/

[18:10] <pmichaud> oh, here's another fix

[18:11] <pmichaud> (working)

[18:11] <frettled> :)

[18:13] <[particle]> the download link should explicitly mention rakudo, because right now it looks like rakudo *is* perl 6

[18:13] <TimToady> someone needs to start Perl6 University so we can get perl6.edu.  :)

[18:13] <pugs_svn> r28141 | pmichaud++ | [perl6.org]:  Revise link for Camelia in "Specification" 

[18:13] <cognominal_> jnthn, I added blizkost to ohloh :  https://www.ohloh.net/p/blizkost/

[18:13] <TimToady> [particle]: I was thinking that would likely be part of Su-Shee's redesign

[18:13] <pmichaud> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/feather/perl6.org/index.html  # reload

[18:13] <pmichaud> I changed the entry for "Camelia" in the Specification

[18:13] <moritz_> what about perl6.mmil? :/

[18:13] <pmichaud> it used to be "camelia.pdf"

[18:14] <pmichaud> now it talks more directly about Camelia herself, with a link to the PDF

[18:14] <frettled> pmichaud++

[18:14] <moritz_> colomon: spectesting your patch

[18:14] <TimToady> the text still says PDF

[18:14] <moritz_> (and I removed some trailing spaces)

[18:14] <pmichaud> ...text still says PDF?

[18:15] <frettled> I think the change is only in svn right now.

[18:15] <pmichaud> it hasn't pushed to perl6.org yet -- there's a delay

[18:15] <frettled> It will happily migrate to the front page when the winds are right, some butterfly has to flap its wings a bit first.

[18:15] <moritz_> TimToady: there are two links - one says PDF and goes to a PDF

[18:15] <TimToady> ah, I see

[18:16] <frettled> Let's overexplain it once more, just for -Ofun ;)

[18:16] * ruoso gives up trying to make the perl6.org site work for people with larger fonts

[18:16] <ruoso> it's broken again

[18:16] <TimToady> hopefully that can also be dealt with in Su-Shee's redesign

[18:16] <[particle]> maybe we need some ruby folks.

[18:16] <pugs_svn> r28142 | colomon++ | [t/spec] More simple Rat tests. 

[18:17] <moritz_> ruoso: since the design will be replaced soonish there's not really a point

[18:18] <pmichaud> I also made a link from the logo itself to the camelia.txt page

[18:18] <Su-Shee> I log everything. 

[18:18] * frettled panics

[18:18] <moritz_> Su-Shee: so do;  I see /topic :-)

[18:18] <masak> on my screen, the design always looked wonky due to my browser window not being wide enough. instead of three boxes per line, I have two. :/

[18:18] * sri_kraih is thinking about drawing a "badass" version of camelia :)

[18:19] <ruoso> masak, that's my case as well, because of the larger fonts

[18:19] <TimToady> for all their problems, tables do a better job of keeping the text in the boxes

[18:19] <frettled> strangely enough, the width is no problem on my netbook

[18:19] <frettled> it's the height :)

[18:19] <masak> ruoso: we're both suffering from widebrowserism, then.

[18:20] <ruoso> TimToady, tables break accessibility

[18:20] <frettled> mobile browsers (earlier known as "phones") and netbooks are "forcing" web designers to rethink their web pages

[18:20] <moritz_> ruoso: not true

[18:20] <TimToady> then make perl6.info accessible :)

[18:20] <moritz_> ruoso: I know blind people, and in general they don't have problems with tabled layouts

[18:21] <masak> http://giveupandusetables.com/

[18:21] <frettled> Su-Shee: One wish for the redesign: please place a download link near the top of the page, where people will see it quickly :)

[18:21] <pmichaud> within the PmWiki community we went through very long and heated discussions about the merits of table versus non-table layouts

[18:21] <frettled> pmichaud: and ended up doing plaintext?  :D

[18:21] <TimToady> let's throw 361 RFCs at Su-Shee and see if she takes six months to recover like I did :)

[18:21] <pmichaud> the final answer was that tables weren't ideal, but they were often less evil than the alternatives (more)

[18:22] <frettled> TimToady: point taken :D

[18:22] <pmichaud> of course, it's quite different in a wiki context because the content isn't static

[18:22] <pmichaud> most approaches to making layouts table-less also assume that the relative sizes of the components are known and/or fixed

[18:22] <frettled> I like floating elements, but there are still differences in rendering that are less than trivial to fix.

[18:23] <pmichaud> but the conclusion that we came to as a group was that making good-quality layouts using tables was far easier than doing table-less layouts

[18:23] <moritz_> they don't have to be rendered identical; they just have to be rendered all OK

[18:23] <frettled> I did some work on this as part of my master studies in 2000-ish, and things haven't improved much regarding floating elements since then.

[18:23] <frettled> (but they have improved)

[18:23] <pmichaud> in particular, table-based layouts are much easier to maintain over time

[18:23] <frettled> yes, except for vertical placement

[18:24] <pmichaud> anyway, that's my experience on the topic

[18:24] <moritz_> anyway, I'll leave that decision to th(os)e who actually implement it

[18:24] <TimToady> it would be nice to have context-sensitive floating elements that know how they got floated and change things that don't influence how the float was calculated, such as color

[18:24] <frettled> mm

[18:24] *** kst left
[18:24] <pmichaud> TimToady: maybe we should throw some cups and work on redesigning CSS :)

[18:25] <frettled> Recent CSS and AJAX can help there.

[18:25] *** kst joined
[18:25] <TimToady> I wouldn't mind the 3-blocks to 2-blocks problem nearly so much if the blocks could change their color

[18:25] <Su-Shee> frettled: the download link was placed right in the middle of the page, but since more links were added, the layout started to scroll. 

[18:25] <TimToady> frettled: I remind myself that CSS also could stand for Cross Site Scripting

[18:26] <frettled> TimToady: we use XSS for that these days :)

[18:26] <[particle]> blocks can change their color, if js in enabled

[18:26] <pmichaud> I've alw.... what frettled++ said

[18:26] <[particle]> we can determine browser width, and load the proper css file

[18:26] <pugs_svn> r28143 | moritz++ | [t/spec] unfudge Rat test that colomon++ has fixed in Rakudo 

[18:26] <TimToady> well, js is okay by me, but flash is too far

[18:27] * moritz_ votes against JS

[18:27] <frettled> I couldn't agree more regarding Flash.

[18:27] <frettled> moritz_: JS is nice if the site works without it.

[18:27] <pmichaud> (couldn't agree more)  perhaps you're just not trying hard enough

[18:27] <pmichaud> :)

[18:27] <frettled> That is, menus etc. should continue to work if JS is disabled.

[18:28] <pmichaud> 0

[18:28] <pmichaud> +        $denominator /= $gcd;

[18:28] <pmichaud> won't work.

[18:28] <moritz_> uhm, why?

[18:28] <pmichaud> because infix:</> of two Ints produces a Rat

[18:28] <TimToady> you need div

[18:29] <moritz_> oh.

[18:29] <colomon> Errr... I thought infix / produced a Num, and infix div produced a Rat?

[18:29] <colomon> that certainly seems to be how things work today?

[18:29] <TimToady> see most recent change to S03

[18:29] <colomon> rakudo: say (1 / 3).WHAT

[18:29] <p6eval> rakudo 5c1bc8: OUTPUT«Num()␤»

[18:30] <TimToady> I decided Rats pretending to be Nums was probably a bad idea

[18:30] <colomon> rakudo: say (1 div 3).WHAT

[18:30] <p6eval> rakudo 5c1bc8: OUTPUT«Rat()␤»

[18:30] <TimToady> just last week

[18:30] <pmichaud> S03:698

[18:30] <pmichaud> C<< infix:</> >>

[18:30] <pmichaud> If both operands are of integer type, the operator returns the

[18:30] <pmichaud> corresponding C<Rat> value.

[18:31] <TimToady> is more consistent with the use of 3/7 as a Rat literal too.

[18:31] *** japhb joined
[18:31] * ruoso still unconfortable about the idea that Num doesn't include all types of numbers

[18:31] <TimToady> and we didn't have a way to get at the integer division primitive

[18:32] <TimToady> "include" is ill defined

[18:32] <colomon> Errr... does that imply that everything we've done with Rat has div and / backwards?

[18:32] <pmichaud> colomon: it might.

[18:32] * ruoso means the "Complex ~~ Num" sense of "include"

[18:32] <pmichaud> I hadn't been looking at infix:<div> much

[18:32] <colomon> Boy, it sure does.

[18:32] <TimToady> we need to come up with a set of roles that describe behaviors, but I think those are a higher level than Int, Num, and Rat

[18:33] <colomon> Any objections to me taking ten minutes to swap those usages, then?

[18:33] <colomon> (It sounds much more appealing than my $work at the moment.)

[18:33] <pmichaud> no objections

[18:33] <ruoso> why can't we use the math definition?

[18:33] <moritz_> colomon: no, you even get 15 ;-)

[18:34] <moritz_> pmichaud++ # reviewing commits

[18:35] <TimToady> fixing

[18:37] <pmichaud> my interpretation  "Complex ~~ Num" being true would be that everywhere that one could use a Num argument, a Complex argument would be handled as well.  I think this would tend to confuse a lot of end-programmers.

[18:37] *** hercynium left
[18:37] <masak> nod.

[18:37] <pmichaud> if I write    sub foo(Num $x) { ... }    I wouldn't expect $x to be able to be a Complex

[18:37] <pmichaud> or, if Num "includes Complex", then I want a type that excludes them.

[18:38] <moritz_> like, Real

[18:38] <pmichaud> (and it would probably have to be called "Float")

[18:38] <pmichaud> I wouldn't want "Real" because floating-point representations aren't really Real :)

[18:38] <ruoso> Real is the math name

[18:38] <TimToady> Flt

[18:38] <ruoso> and it does make a lot of sense

[18:38] <moritz_> the problem with "Float" is that people will ask where the Doubles are

[18:38] <pmichaud> I always read "Flt" as "flight", though.

[18:38] <ruoso> pmichaud, that's the point where I think we need to split conceptual types from storage types

[18:39] <ruoso> Float is a storage types

[18:39] <ruoso> *type

[18:39] <TimToady> Int, Num, and Rat are Storage Types (abstract)

[18:39] <ruoso> Real is a conceptual type

[18:39] <TimToady> I repeat, define the math roles at a higher level than that, please

[18:39] <ruoso> TimToady, I'd replace Num by Float in that case

[18:39] <TimToady> Imaginary ~~ Numeric is fine

[18:39] <TimToady> Float is ugly

[18:40] <TimToady> that's why it's Num

[18:40] <pmichaud> Numeric++

[18:40] <ruoso> I'm fine if the Math types have long names

[18:40] <colomon> Okay, I've just gotten div for Rat out of the spectests, as far as I can tell.  Of course, this will break the world until Rakudo catches up (which I will attempt next).  Should I check it in now?  Seems unwise...

[18:40] <TimToady> and Real can be Rat|Num

[18:40] <ruoso> Numeric, Complex, Imaginary, Real, Integer, Natural

[18:40] <TimToady> that is, both Rat and Num does Real

[18:41] <pmichaud> colomon: you can always temporarily fudge the tests

[18:41] <ruoso> TimToady, that's what I mean, yes

[18:41] <colomon> pmichaud: True.  Suppose I should go ahead, do that, check things in, and then look at fixing the operators themselves?

[18:42] <ruoso> in fact we have both Rational and Irrational as subsets of Real

[18:42] <ruoso> and Integer is a subset of Rational

[18:42] <pmichaud> colomon: the other approach would be to submit the test changes along with the rakudo patch :)

[18:42] <TimToady> Int, Num, and Rat are like the intermediate layer of a neural net that crossbars the inputs to the outputs

[18:42] <pmichaud> colomon: still another approach would be to get you a Rakudo commitbit :)

[18:42] <colomon> pmichaud: You mean at the same time, via the two different methods of patching?  Or generating a patch file for pugs as well.

[18:43] <pmichaud> colomon: generate a patch for pugs as well

[18:43] <pmichaud> it's just "svn diff"

[18:43] <colomon> Sure, but I have a commit bit there!  ;)

[18:43] <ruoso> http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/images/number-sets.gif

[18:43] <TimToady> that is, pragmatic abstractions like Rat are mediating between the mathematical abstractions and the machine types

[18:43] <pmichaud> yes, but by submitting them together you can make sure the tests get updated the same time as rakudo

[18:44] <TimToady> so the third layer is appropriate

[18:44] <ruoso> TimToady, agreed... so we have three sets of types

[18:44] <pmichaud> anyway, I'd personally go with the fudge approach if it were me

[18:44] <ruoso> Numeric, Complex, Imaginary, Real, Irrational, Rational, Integer, Natural

[18:45] <pmichaud> maybe we should just call the types   N, Z, Q, R, I, and C  :-P  

[18:45] <ruoso> pmichaud, we could use the proper unicode symbosl

[18:45] <pmichaud> even .... exactly :)

[18:45] <jeekobu> Transcendental, Algebraic

[18:45] <colomon> ruoso++ for a good kind of insanity

[18:46] <pmichaud> rakudo:  say "\c[DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R]"

[18:46] <p6eval> rakudo 5c1bc8: OUTPUT«ℝ␤»

[18:46] <TimToady> just keep your mits off my TLTs

[18:46] <jeekobu> Computable

[18:47] <pmurias> please don't make perl 6 use silly letters

[18:47] <TimToady> define "silly letter"

[18:47] <ruoso> TimToady, TLT?

[18:47] <TimToady> Three Letter Types

[18:47] <pmichaud> afk for a bit

[18:48] <ruoso> pmurias, the math roles are going to have specific uses, I think it's pretty much ok to have them with the unicode symbols

[18:48] <ruoso> I even think the mathematicians will thank us

[18:49] <ruoso> there isn't a symbol for Numeric, I guess

[18:50] <moritz_> is there any numeric type more general than Complex?

[18:50] *** molaf joined
[18:51] <TimToady> the roles should be spelled out, but we can make it easy to get the symbols, as with Sets

[18:51] *** Zloyrusskiy joined
[18:51] <TimToady> I think this should probably be general policy

[18:51] *** masak left
[18:51] <colomon> moritz_: Yes, but it's sort of orthogonal to the divisions you guys have been looking at.

[18:51] <TimToady> maybe a pragma saying "whenever you have the choice of importing Unicode symbols, do so"

[18:51] <pmurias> moritz_: i was wrong sorry

[18:52] <colomon> Basically you define really abstract concepts and see what fits.

[18:52] <colomon> Like "groups" and "rings".

[18:52] *** Zloyrusskiy left
[18:53] <pmurias> are those distinct letters or just a traditional way of writing them

[18:53] *** kst left
[18:53] <ruoso> pmurias, they are specific to the math use

[18:53] <colomon> I guess I'd like to see a more formal proposal for this.  The geek part of me loves getting the unicode symbols in there, but it's not at all clear to me how you can usefully program using this information.

[18:53] <sharada> what about H

[18:53] *** kst joined
[18:54] <ruoso> TimToady, what about Complex? are you going to define a TLT for it?

[18:54] <TimToady> it's been considered in the past

[18:54] <TimToady> but none of them look very good

[18:55] <pmichaud> colomon: for most programs I suspect one wouldn't need to use these higher-level types

[18:58] <alester> OK, who has the serious psychological issues/  Fess up!

[18:59] <colomon> pmichaud: I guess what I'm trying to say is that for most things, it seems like the knowledge that this numeric type forms a ring is much more useful than the knowledge it is a complex number.

[19:00] <colomon> and it seems like a lot of work "just" to give yourself the ability to have, say, complex numbers defined using Rats rather than Nums.

[19:00] <ruoso> N2D

[19:00] <ruoso> Number with 2 Dimensions

[19:00] <colomon> Actually, maybe that's not the greatest example, because I can see room for a "complex" role no matter what.

[19:01] <TimToady> ruoso: no, the dimensions are wonky :)

[19:01] <TimToady> from a vector-space point of view

[19:02] <colomon> Hey, I've got the rat.t spectest running again.

[19:02] <alester> Otherwise it's just SO KICKASS for trying.

[19:02] <colomon> Now let's see how badly I blew up the rest of the world.

[19:02] <literal> I've only got a few small kinks to work out, but I have to go play some pool, so I thought I'd let you know I've got something 

[19:02] <alester> But if you can pull it off, you get four extra SO

[19:04] *** ezra joined
[19:04] <ruoso> TimToady, C99 does define a complex type, but I'm not sure there is platform specific native support for math with complex numbers...

[19:05] <ruoso> maybe there isn't a point in a non-high-level Complex type

[19:05] <colomon> Hmmm... maybe the right way to state my objection is, what functions make sense to define on Int that one should not define on Rat?  In other words, why would the abstract roles be different?

[19:05] *** |Ryan52 joined
[19:05] <ruoso> hmm... no... I'm wrong... 

[19:05] <ruoso> every number ~~ Complex

[19:05] <ruoso> but not every number ~~ R_I

[19:06] <ruoso> because R_I would mean it actually has two slots (one for the real part, other for the imaginary)

[19:07] <TimToady> yes, the pragmatic types imply something about slots, without overspecifying the slots

[19:07] <TimToady> that seems like a good way to look at it

[19:09] <TimToady> but I do think the math folk would rather write Complex and have it pun into a class with a default implementation of R_I, as it were

[19:09] <ruoso> hmm

[19:09] <colomon> sharada: Ah, yes, you were pointing out the obvious set of numbers that contains Complex.  I forgot that H was Hamilton numbers (quaternions).

[19:09] <ruoso> it does make a lot of sense...

[19:09] * PerlJam wonders if he's a "math folk" then

[19:09] <ruoso> because Rat is simply a number with two slots as well

[19:10] <ruoso> and so is Float

[19:10] *** M_o_C joined
[19:10] <TimToady> but also a relationship between the slots

[19:10] <ruoso> sure... the type defines how many slots and what they mean

[19:11] <ruoso> then you have the actual implementation types (native?)

[19:12] <TimToady> some of them are considered native

[19:12] <TimToady> but there are potentially many implementation types that look more like objects

[19:12] <TimToady> gets fuzzy

[19:13] <TimToady> native more or less means the hardware will get upset if you try to add slots to this

[19:13] *** zamolxes joined
[19:14] <ruoso> TimToady, native to Perl 6, I mean, not to the hardware

[19:14] <TimToady> derivation is constrained not to change representation

[19:14] *** RonOreck joined
[19:14] <ruoso> yeah... that's the point... the vm needs to be able to do calculations with them

[19:15] <TimToady> augment int32 { has $.foo } # kaboom

[19:15] <ruoso> I think it's quite sane to constrain the changes in representation of number implementation types 

[19:16] <ruoso> so we leave some room for optimization

[19:16] <ruoso> you can customize the other two layers already

[19:17] * ruoso .oO( thinking about slots, it makes even less sense to call Float as Num, because it's actually two numbers.. )

[19:19] <colomon> Errr... if Float is two, then the standard Complex implementation is four, no?

[19:20] <ruoso> colomon, 2 slots that *might* hold 2 slots each

[19:20] *** donaldh left
[19:20] <ruoso> colomon, it's not that Complex itself holds 4 slots

[19:20] <ruoso> after all, you can have a Complex built with two Integers

[19:20] <ruoso> 1 + 1i

[19:20] *** donaldh joined
[19:22] <ruoso> but Complex as the conceptual type doesn't imply the number of slots

[19:22] <ruoso> since 1 ~~ Complex

[19:22] <ruoso> R_I does

[19:23] <ruoso> (I think that name will stick)

[20:31] <colomon> About 1/3 of the way through the swap(div, /) spectest errors...

[20:35] <colomon> Errr... anyone out there know why »div« might work when >>div<< fails with a "ResizablePMCArray: Can't pop from an empty array!" error?

[20:39] * frettled just finished glancing at the Wikipedia article for quaternions.  Shame on you, colomon and ruoso, now you got me thinking about how I could write a sensible blog post about it.  ;)

[20:41] <moritz_> colomon: might be a mis-parse

[20:42] <colomon> Actually, it's weirder than that, I misread the error.  

[20:42] <moritz_> I know this error from unterminated ternary operators

[20:42] <moritz_> rakudo: 1 ?? 3

[20:42] <colomon> I switched »/« to »div«, and that seems to have broken >>xx<< twenty lines later.

[20:42] *** iblechbot left
[20:43] <frettled> Is this what we call involuntary refactoring?

[20:43] <colomon> No, it's >>div<< after all?

[20:43] <colomon> frettled: yes.

[20:44] <moritz_> colomon: »div« and >>div<< should be identical

[20:44] <frettled> IIRC, all unicodish variants have ASCII equivalents.

[20:44] <colomon> I think >>div<< isn't parsing correctly.

[20:45] <moritz_> note that it's missing from build/gen_metaop_pir.pl

[20:46] <moritz_> so the >>div<< hyper op is never generated

[20:46] <colomon> Any hints on how to fix that?

[20:47] <lisppaste3> moritz_ pasted "generate >>div<< etc. for colomon++" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/86326

[20:48] <moritz_> (note that this change might require a reconfigure)

[20:50] <colomon> Okay, cross your fingers...

[20:50] *** mikehh_ joined

[21:17] <masak> bioSlayer: o/

[21:17] <ruoso> colomon, oh... are you doing it already?

[21:18] <colomon> I'm working on the / switch with div.

[21:18] <bioSlayer> I have this question, If Perl 6 is the next big thing happening in Perl, how do you perceive a transition experience from Perl 5 to Perl 6

[21:18] <bioSlayer> I hope this can be in context with the ongoing conversation and pard me for the interruption 

[21:18] <moritz_> ruoso: colomon is patching the test suite and rakudo to conform to the current spec

[21:18] <colomon> Looks like I may have to dig into the Temporal code...

[21:18] <moritz_> bioSlayer: there are several options; one is embedding Perl 5 code in Perl 6 programs

[21:19] <moritz_> bioSlayer: jnthn is working on a prototype that enables that, see http://github.com/jnthn/blizkost/tree/master

[21:19] <masak> bioSlayer: you're not at all interrupting anything, by the way. we love that kind of question.

[21:19] <ruoso> bioSlayer, additionally, there's a plan on modifying the p5 interpreter so it will be able to run Perl 6

[21:20] <masak> colomon: oh hai. I have an ongoing fork where I work with the Temporal code. wanna collaborate?

[21:20] <colomon> masak: It's just going through and changing / to div repeatedly...

[21:20] <bioSlayer> and how about the syntax structure and the commands, do we really like have to forget about Perl 5 to learn this one, thing is I have just started learning Perl these two months

[21:20] <masak> colomon: ah. never mind, then. :)

[21:21] <moritz_> bioSlayer: some things are different, but all in all it feels rather similar to Perl 5

[21:21] <masak> bioSlayer: Perl 5 knowledge will keep being useful for many years to come.

[21:21] <masak> bioSlayer: with that said, I know and use both Perl 5 and Perl 6 daily, and I greatly prefer the syntax and semantics of Perl 6.

[21:23] <bioSlayer> ummm, so if I learnt the major things out there in Perl 5, I can still learn or rather "Transit" to Perl 6 on the fly? 

[21:24] <frettled> Yes, sortof.

[21:46] <frettled> ah!

[21:46] <p6eval> rakudo e00587: OUTPUT«{"a" => 7, "b" => 8, "c" => 9}␤»

[21:46] <masak> there you go.

[21:46] <frettled> thanks!

[21:46] <moritz_> which means that the load is high, and chances for a timeout are even higher

[21:46] <masak> :)

[21:47] <masak> the intricacies of providing a self-refreshing evalbot.

[21:47] <frettled> yep

[21:47] <moritz_> aye. *sigh*

[21:47] <moritz_> why doesn't somebody else take care of it? I'm not that good with sysadmin stuff

[21:48] <moritz_> http://github.com/moritz/hugme/ # source of hugme, for your inspection :-)

[21:48] <masak> \o/

[21:49] <frettled> moritz_: if someone else took care of it, then we couldn't complain to you :)

[22:05] * moritz_ hates it that JSON doesn't allow trailing commas after lists

[22:06] <masak> kent\n: oh hai. I like the style of the logo. it looks mature.

[22:06] <frettled> Now I just wonder if I've gotten my Perl 5.10.1 code right, haha.

[22:07] <masak> kent\n: it's kinda the antithesis of Camelia.

[22:07] <kent\n> masak: I had hoped at very least it might give somebody a few alternative ideas :)

[22:07] <masak> I think it might.

[22:10] <pmichaud> good evening, #perl6

[22:11] <kent\n> masak: the vibe I was trying to do was "programmers and designers dont do well being the same person, but its plain to see the existing idea is a bit nasty and dated, even for a programmer, heres proof, now go hire somebody who knows what they're doing plz" 

[22:11] *** SmokeMachine left
[22:11] <masak> kent\n: I half-got that this was what you wanted to say.

[22:12] <kent\n> the existing logo is fine... if your target audience is about 6.

[22:12] <kent\n> years old. 

[22:12] <masak> yes.

[22:12] <masak> your point being? :)

[22:12] <kent\n> my point is made earlier :) 

[22:12] <masak> oh, ok.

[22:13] <PerlJam> cultural wonkiness is our forte  ;)

[22:13] <kent\n> PerlJam:  with that logic, we should have stuck with goatse for a logo =P

[22:14] <PerlJam> kent\n: except that aesthetics matter and goatse is unappealing to almost everybody.

[22:14] <kent\n> yes. quite. 

[22:15] <kent\n> cultural wonkiness is probably fine if you only want to attract existing perl programmers, but like churches, you can't cater explicitly to the inhouse, you have to be prepared to meet the outside world or you'll crust up and die 

[22:15] <frettled> kent\n: I think you may be placing a bit too much importance in a logo.

[22:15] <kent\n> possibly.

[22:16] <kent\n> but I'd rather not be giving out low-hanging lambast fruit 

[22:16] <PerlJam> kent\n: If it 's fine for 6 year olds, it's fine for you too  :)

[22:16] <frettled> kent\n: PHP's huge userbase doesn't seem to be overly bothered by their completely lackluster logo :)

[22:17] <PerlJam> frettled: PHP has a logo?

[22:17] <frettled> exactly :)

[22:17] <kent\n> that was my next question. 

[22:17] <frettled> http://static.php.net/www.php.net/images/php.gif

[22:17] <frettled> and what about Python, or Ruby?

[22:17] <kent\n> yeah, but now imagine if they'd slapped barney the purple dinosaur on their logo 

[22:18] <kent\n> it would be amusingly apt

[22:18] *** ruoso left
[22:18] <frettled> That might get them some attention.  ;)

[22:18] <kent\n> python: snakes

[22:18] <kent\n> ruby: rubies

[22:18] <frettled> Just one ruby, currently.

[22:19] <frettled> And Python's use of stylized snakes looks like something a 7-year old may have come up with while bored in class.  Yet it doesn't seem important.

[22:19] <kent\n> I'm more familiar with the snake on the front of the books than on their logos

[22:20] <frettled> as we're all probably more familiar with the Camel on the Camel Book than … uh, I don't even _know_.

[22:20] *** KatrinaTheLamia joined
[22:20] <moritz_> the onion?

[22:20] <PerlJam> garlic may be more apt in some cases :)

[22:20] <frettled> Isn't that the Perl Foundation's logo?

[22:20] <kent\n> the onion seems to be only known heavily by in-house 

[22:21] <kent\n> although, tis the only offical one we can use thats not copyright to Oriely 

[22:21] <frettled> perl.org confusingly uses both.

[22:21] <sjohnson> perl => pearls :)

[22:21] <PerlJam> sjohnson: that's the wrong kind of confusion there.

[22:22] <kent\n> even with pearls, big balls of white opaqueness are really hard to make a decent logo out of with only ~6 colours to play with

[22:23] * kent\n decides Perl's logo should be a fecking great block of cheese

[22:24] <kent\n> why? no reason. 

[22:24] <pmichaud> I think masak++ has the cheese logo rights :)

[22:24] <Juerd> Is Camelia trademarked?

[22:24] * PerlJam carves the cheese into something resembling a troll just for kentn :)

[22:24] <frettled> Juerd: yes.

[22:24] <Juerd> It has a small "TM". That's ugly :(

[22:24] <pmichaud> Juerd: trademarked, yes, not registered yet (afaik)

[22:25] <Juerd> I hope it will be like tux, in the sense that you can use it for whatever purpose without having to ask anyone.

[22:25] <pmichaud> Juerd: http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/camelia.txt

[22:25] <masak> I hereby cede all cheese logo rights. :)

[22:25] <kent\n> alternatively, a chilli-bean ( if it is not already used, but I bet it is ) would be a good compliment to an onion 

[22:25] <pmichaud> The Camelia image is a trademark of Larry Wall, and permission is

[22:25] <pmichaud> granted for non-exclusive use to label anything related to Perl 6,

[22:25] <pmichaud> provided the image is labeled as a trademark when used as a main logo

[22:25] <pmichaud> on a page.

[22:26] <Juerd> pmichaud: That's good enough, as everything in existence is related to Perl 6 somehow :D

[22:26] <PerlJam> kent\n: you should read that page pmichaud just mentioned too

[22:26] <kent\n> we could just revamp the onion logo 

[22:26] <kent\n> I've on occasion glossed over it 

[22:26] <Juerd> kent\n: Have you seen Camelia? She's *beautiful*

[22:27] <kent\n> I'm sure somebody could retain the beauty, and approach a better degree of reality 

[22:27] <PerlJam> "reality"?

[22:27] <Juerd> Reality!

[22:27] <Juerd> Hah! :)

[22:27] <Juerd> Ever since junctions I haven't cared... ;)

[22:27] <kent\n> If you could get the proper metalic sheen of butterfly wings, that'd be ossum 

[22:28] <PerlJam> kent\n: have you seen padre's splash screen?

[22:28] * kent\n thinks he has

[22:28] <pmichaud> I think TimToady++ wants Camelia to be about as real as Tux is.

[22:28] <Juerd> "It is not necessary to so label icons"... Yay!

[22:29] <Juerd> I have the onion logo *illegally* on juerd.nl, because it doesn't have that exclusion to the requirement.

[22:29] <Juerd> (Haven't asked permission either, though.)

[22:29] * kent\n would like to see an onion, complete with glossy brown skin tones and green shoot emerging

[22:30] <PerlJam> kent\n: I'm sure you could find one like that at your local market  ;)

[22:30] <kent\n> but not a photo, sort of cgi-ish

[22:30] <Juerd> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelia  # hmmm

[22:31] <Juerd> Not bad either in terms of prettiness.

[22:32] <frettled> A disambiguation page is clearly needed.

[22:32] <PerlJam> camelia is also some type of flower IIRC

[22:32] <frettled> «Camellia»

[22:33] <PerlJam> ah, two els

[22:33] <PerlJam> However ... http://camelia.sourceforge.net/

[22:34] <PerlJam> We just have to win the meme war.  Given the controversy already, we're sure to do so  ;)

[22:34] <frettled> hee-hee

[22:34] <frettled> Okay, let's fix the Wikipedia article first, and then move the current Camelia article to a new place, and … :D

[22:35] <kent\n> http://www.hallagulla.com/urdu/photo/data/500/10_Onion.jpg # is nice, but whiter and slightly more toony would be awesome

[22:35] <frettled> …or maybe I should just go get my beauty sleep, I have to pick up my car in 6.5-ish hours.  Bleh.  :(

[22:35] <Juerd> kent\n: There's no use in replacing the onion logo. It's already a well known and recognised logo around the world.

[22:35] <Juerd> (in the community)

[22:35] <frettled> g'night!

[22:36] <moritz_> 'night

[22:36] <PerlJam> good night frettled 

[22:36] <Juerd> Good night

[22:36] <masak> 'night, frettled

[22:36] <pmichaud> A bit of historical perspective on Tux (and that might be relevant to Camelia):  http://gist.github.com/178756

[22:36] <kent\n> yeah.  I just figgured, perl6 is inspired by some of the old with a lot of the new, so I can't see why an revamps for it could be an option. but meh. 

[22:37] <TimToady> cultural wonkiness is one of the invariants

[22:37] <TimToady> that makes Perl 6 the same as Perl 5

[22:38] <TimToady> and the fact is, we *are* aiming to impress 6-year-olds

[22:39] <TimToady> and these days, toons are big business :)

[22:40] <PerlJam> Pokemon Camelia should go over well.

[22:40] <TimToady> and so far, I haven't seen anyone jolted by Camelia that couldn't use a little jolting

[22:40] <PerlJam> Anime Camelia for the older crowd

[22:41] <kent\n> man, I can see a rule 34 coming a mile off :( 

[22:42] <TimToady> to the pure, all things are pure :)

[22:43] <kent\n> I can smell circular logic the same way 

[22:43] <TimToady> it's all circular at some level or other

[22:44] <masak> or axiomatic.

[22:45] <PerlJam> masak++

[22:45] <TimToady> axioms circle themselves

[22:45] <masak> :)

[22:45] <masak> well, if you're using _that_ definition of circular, then sure...

[22:46] <TimToady> almost all cultural fights involve someone assuming something is axiomatic that someone else wants to take a circularity saw to

[22:46] <TimToady> I personally want to take a circularity saw to corporate logo culture

[22:47] * kent\n asserts the world really does revolve around himself, and nobody can prove concretely the contrary

[22:48] <TimToady> 'coure not, that's what time is for

[22:48] <TimToady> *course

[22:48] *** FCO left
[22:49] <moritz_> now if you find a good, non-circular explanation of what time is... the Nobel Price might be yours!

[22:49] <TimToady> well, maybe next time around

[22:49] <kent\n> easy.

[22:49] <kent\n> time isn't.  

[22:51] <pmichaud> I'd come up with a good non-circulation explanation of time but it's likely to take me too long to do it.

[22:51] <TimToady> one could probably figure out a sequence of logic from that premise that indicates the world doesn't revolve around you

[22:51] <pmichaud> *non-circular

[22:52] <kent\n> there is no time, I'm just imagining it.

[22:52] <TimToady> since, obviously, revolution cannot occur without time :)

[22:52] <kent\n> not true. 

[22:52] <kent\n> I could just be imagining things are revolving 

[22:52] <kent\n> they might not exist at all.

[22:52] <masak> that's not a very interesting hypothesis, that's all.

[22:53] <kent\n> say what you will, you've just been unthunk

[22:53] <kent\n> this line of thought is boring

[22:53] <kent\n> NEXT

[22:54] *** sevvie joined
[22:54] <masak> I've discovered what I think is a very strange bug having to do with Str methods. I think I'm too tired to track it down, however.

[22:54] <pmichaud> it's very likely

[22:54] <TimToady> what color is it?

[22:54] <pmichaud> we're still getting many of the fundamentals in place

[22:54] <masak> my blog post is blocking on it, so it'll have to wait 'til tomorrow.

[22:55] <masak> I can already report that it's a lot of fun to be writing literate Perl 6.

[22:55] <TimToady> I think I've figured out the refactor of 'is context'

[22:55] <masak> if you want, I can gist you a preview of the post.

[22:55] <pmichaud> oh, good timing :)

[22:55] <pmichaud> masak: if you gist me a preview, I might be able to work on the bug a bit tonight

[22:55] <masak> pmichaud: if you want. :) I can say it's quite involved.

[22:56] * pmichaud eagerly awaits 'is context' improvements, since that's his next major area of focus

[22:56] <TimToady> in a nutshell, any var declared as $*foo is contextual

[22:56] <pmichaud> so,   my $*foo = 5;   # contextual

[22:56] <TimToady> so my $*answer = 42

[22:56] <pmichaud> I like it

[22:56] <TimToady> yes

[22:56] <pmichaud> I like it _very much_

[22:56] <TimToady> then there's the readonly question

[22:56] <pmichaud> yes, I was about to ask that :)

[22:56] <TimToady> I think there's a new declarator

[22:57] <TimToady> for which I've looked at what seems like several hundred names

[22:57] <TimToady> but for now, call it 'def'

[22:57] <pmichaud> so, what was the several hundred plus one'th name?

[22:57] <pmichaud> 'def'

[22:57] <pmichaud> hmmm.

[22:57] <TimToady> which is a declaration of a readonly of any sort

[22:57] <TimToady> def $x = 42;  $x = 43; # boom

[22:57] <pmichaud> reminds me a bit too much of python

[22:57] <TimToady> too bad :)

[22:58] <pmichaud> you decided against 'constant'?

[22:58] <TimToady> constant evaluates = at compile tim

[22:58] <TimToady> *time

[22:58] <pmichaud> ah.

[22:58] <TimToady> this evaluates at run time

[22:58] <masak> pmichaud: http://gist.github.com/178765

[22:58] <TimToady> so combining, you get def $*answer = 42

[22:58] <pmichaud> hmmm

[22:58] <masak> pmichaud: line 223 causes the Str method to return nothing.

[22:58] <TimToady> and then any subroutine gets $*answer as readonly 42

[22:59] <Juerd> Doesn't "def" want to be the opposite of "undef"?

[22:59] <TimToady> but other threads might be running with different answers

[22:59] <Juerd> Can you undef a def?

[22:59] <Juerd> Can you def something to be undef?

[22:59] <pmichaud> readonly-ness still feels like a trait to me, but that's probably because I still think of "is rw" and "is copy" and "is ref" having similar effects on variables

[23:00] <pmichaud> truly, I'd almost expect read-only to be the default behavior of :=

[23:00] <pmichaud> my $x := 42;  $x = 43;  # boom

[23:00] <TimToady> it represents the same semantics that parameters get by default

[23:00] <TimToady> my $x := 42; $x := 43; # non-boom

[23:00] <TimToady> def $x := 42; $x := 43; # boom

[23:00] *** kst left
[23:00] <masak> TimToady: then maybe call it 'bind'?

[23:01] * masak is not surprised

[23:01] <TimToady> it might or might not even be the best one

[23:01] <pmichaud> I agree with Juerd that def <-> undef is a bit disconcerting

[23:01] <pmichaud> I don't have any better suggestions at the moment

[23:01] <pmichaud> actually 'readonly' comes to mind :)

[23:01] <TimToady> too ong

[23:01] <TimToady> *long

[23:02] <pmichaud> I suspect it's uncommon enough that length isn't an issue, though.

[23:02] <Juerd> ensure, force, keep, uphold

[23:02] <pmichaud> I agree it's lengthy

[23:02] <pmichaud> sometimes clarity trumps brevity, I think.

[23:02] <TimToady> yes, the thesaurus has many words in those categories

[23:02] <Juerd> uphold $foo = 42;

[23:02] <TimToady> I would really like both

[23:02] <pmichaud> agreed, me too.

[23:03] <masak> 'night, y'all.

[23:03] *** masak left
[23:03] <TimToady> since this is likely to replace 'my' in single assignment contexts

[23:03] <Juerd> TimToady: That's why I'm providing a filtered view :)

[23:03] <pmichaud> I truly doubt I'll come up with any words that aren't in the hundreds you've considered, but I'll see if any spring to mind

[23:03] <Juerd> TimToady: The whole thesaurus would flood the channel

[23:03] <TimToady> I rather liked 'posit', but even that is a bit long

[23:04] <pmichaud> 'fix' or 'fixed'

[23:04] <TimToady> <-> fixed point

[23:04] <Juerd> pmichaud: Brilliant :)

[23:04] <pmichaud> 'fix' <-> fixed point seems less jarring to me than def <-> undef

[23:05] <TimToady> so $x = 42;  # :-)

[23:05] <Juerd> pmichaud: I'd *love* to say "fix $this for $me;" Is assignment mandatory? :)

[23:05] <pmichaud> Juerd: I suspect not :)

[23:05] <TimToady> there are also lots of possible variants that change the = instead of the declarator

[23:05] <pmichaud> ooooh

[23:05] <pmichaud> that would be useful to

[23:06] <pmichaud> and there's always 'but'

[23:06] <pmichaud> my $x = 42 but readonly

[23:06] <pmichaud> (too long, yes, I know)

[23:06] <Juerd> Can a 'but' avoid future ':='?

[23:06] <TimToady> one could even force 'my $x == 42;' to work

[23:06] <pmichaud> I like changing the '=' because one could have something that is rw for a while and *then* becomes readonly afterwards

[23:07] <TimToady> then == is out :)

[23:07] <TimToady> so what operator means 'posit'?

[23:07] <TimToady> my $x <- 42

[23:08] <Juerd> What does the word posit mean?

[23:08] <TimToady> my $x ≣ 42;

[23:09] <TimToady> it means 'suppose for now'

[23:09] <pmichaud> isn't that "let"  ?

[23:09] <TimToady> yes, but we've used that

[23:09] <TimToady> unless we kill both temp and let

[23:09] <pmichaud> we still have "let"?

[23:09] <pmichaud> ah.

[23:09] * Juerd suggests my $x <-> 42 and finds a place to hide

[23:09] *** justatheory left
[23:09] <pmichaud> we already have <->  as a lambda :)

[23:09] <pmichaud> it does mean "rw", however :)

[23:09] <TimToady> that's why Juerd is hiding

[23:09] <pmichaud> and -> means "ro"

[23:09] <Juerd> I'm hiding for multiple reasons

[23:10] <TimToady> so <- should ro the $x :)

[23:10] <Juerd> I remember that <- used to be a problem, but that's fixed by the whitespace rules now.

[23:11] <pmichaud> <:=

[23:11] <TimToady> and, of course, there's all sorts of arrows in unicode

[23:11] <Juerd> Still, though, it reads as "write only" because of the way arrows are used with for.

[23:12] <TimToady> of course, CS folks who use arrow to mean assignment will be confused :)

[23:12] <Juerd> Won't CS folks be confused, anyway, by Perl 6?

[23:13] <pmichaud> right along with the math folks :)

[23:13] <Juerd> I know I am :D

[23:13] <Juerd> pmichaud: They have been confused by every programming language so far :)

[23:13] <TimToady> if we made declarations at the end of feed operators readonly, then my $x <== 42 would work

[23:14] <pmichaud> Yes, but I still somewhat like the notion of being able to mark a container as "fixed" at some point other than its declaration.

[23:14] <Juerd> Visually, "is readonly" is lighter than "<==". It's also easier to type...

[23:14] <pmichaud> I don't know why I like that notion, I just do.

[23:14] <colomon> moritz_, pmichaud, masak: RT #68898 is the complete Int / Int swap with div patch, both rakudo and spectest bits.  It's mostly there, and hopefully the e-mail and commit note successfully explain its flaws.

[23:14] <Juerd> pmichaud: That would be wonderful for when you're paranoid about AaaD

[23:14] <pmichaud> Juerd: it also reminds me of the way we do things in other contexts (more)

[23:15] <TimToady> $x <- 42;  assign and set readonly

[23:15] <pmichaud> For example, often a process will start out with superuser privileges, and then it drops those privileges after doing some bit of setup.  This is the same sort of thing for individual containers

[23:15] <Juerd> <- has the same problem that def has. It looks like the opposite of something that's already there but has very little to do with it.

[23:15] *** nihiliad left
[23:16] <TimToady> it means bind to this with readonly semantics in both cases

[23:16] *** rhr joined
[23:16] <TimToady> and the ends of <-> just cancel :)

[23:16] <pmichaud> I don't know that "set readonly" has to be an operator; I'd be fine with it being de-huffmanized and there being a short declarator form.  

[23:16] <Juerd> pmichaud: I imagine such a fix operater used on configuration. my %foo = eval $config-file's-contents; fix %foo;

[23:16] <pmichaud> Juerd: exactly.

[23:17] <pmichaud> but in that sense it almost sounds like 'final'

[23:17] <pmichaud> (which might be an argument against it)

[23:18] <Juerd> Well, at least "fix" has the antonym "break" ;)

[23:18] <TimToady> why wouldn't you just say fix %foo = eval ...

[23:18] <Juerd> TimToady: Because you want to do something in between too.

[23:18] <TimToady> or my %foo <-- eval...

[23:18] <TimToady> that's what do blocks are for :)

[23:18] <pmichaud> :)

[23:18] <Juerd> TimToady: my %foo = eval ...; %foo.values >>~~ s/.../.../; fix %foo;

[23:18] <TimToady> FP is your friend (sometimes)

[23:18] <pmichaud> and yes, one could always do the building in another variable, then assign to the "fixed" one.

[23:19] <Juerd> TimToady: I can't really answer any "why would you want that" question, though, because I already feel that way about making variables immutable anyway.

[23:19] <TimToady> I have a soft spot in my heart for imperative programming, but I'd rather encourage FP where not inconvenient

[23:20] *** donaldh left
[23:20] <pmichaud> The only counter-case I can come up with is that I might want to have a sub or trait that "fixes" one of its parameter arguments.

[23:20] <pmichaud> but it's a weak case.

[23:20] <TimToady> it really is pretty much identical to the semantics we want parameters to default to

[23:20] *** donaldh joined
[23:20] <TimToady> I suppose we could steal := for this, at some expense

[23:21] <Juerd> I suspect that that expense would not be that large in practice.

[23:22] <TimToady> it would be more of a unification with sig binding

[23:22] <Juerd> my $foo := ...; $foo := ...; feels weird anyway.

[23:23] <TimToady> rebinding would still be possble with an appropriate declarator

[23:23] <TimToady> this is all very Hmm-y

[23:23] <Juerd> TimToady: :dwis

[23:23] <pmichaud> that doesn't feel so weird to me -- it just means I'm re-binding an existing symbol

[23:23] <pmichaud> certainly I'd want   &foo := ...   to work

[23:23] <Juerd> Convincing example.

[23:24] <TimToady> basically, we want a light container bind, and a heavier container/contents bind and make readonly

[23:24] * Juerd forgot what ::= meant. Which synopsis is that?

[23:24] <pmichaud> ::= is a compile-time bind

[23:25] <TimToady> could also be stolen

[23:25] <pmichaud> yes.

[23:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> Juerd: ::= is compiler time bind

[23:25] <Juerd> No synopsis where I can read the details? :)

[23:25] <pmichaud> Synopsis 2, I think.

[23:25] <pmichaud> maybe 3.

[23:25] <Juerd> (Thanks for the swift answers though)

[23:25] <KatrinaTheLamia> I dunno, I don't mind doing := over and over again... would be good, actually.. make it so there are less syntax errors of "=" in boolean statements.

[23:25] * Juerd used to know all the synopsis numbers. Now there are 42 times as many, and I forgot even the ones I knew.

[23:26] <wayland76> S03 operators

[23:26] <pmichaud> wayland76 ftw

[23:26] <wayland76> And S11 modules

[23:26] <wayland76> ..according to fgrep -c '::=' * | grep -v ':0'

[23:27] <pmichaud> anyway, just going through this discussion I naturally tend to use "fix" as the verb (much more so than I'd want to use "def") 

[23:27] <Juerd> Under what circumstances would one prefer compile time binding?

[23:27] <pmichaud> anyway, I'm being called to dinner

[23:27] <Juerd> Bon apetit

[23:27] <TimToady> when one gets tired of writing BEGIN { ... := ... }  :)

[23:27] <Juerd> s/p/pp/

[23:28] <pmichaud> TimToady: Big +2 on the my $*foo  declarations -- it's perfect.

[23:28] <TimToady> my STD is already written that way, and works :)

[23:28] <TimToady> thinking hard about stealing ::= to mean bind and lock

[23:28] <pmichaud> I bet I can add trivially add it to Rakudo as well.

[23:28] <pmichaud> I'd be find with ::= meaning "bind and lock"

[23:28] <pmichaud> *fine

[23:28] <pmichaud> I haven't had a lot of use for :=

[23:28] <pmichaud> er, ::=

[23:29] <pmichaud> (I've had a *lot* of use for :=)

[23:29] <pmichaud> (not to mention that it makes excellent smileys when used at the end of a parenthetical thought :=)

[23:29] <pmichaud> okay, gone for now

[23:29] <TimToady> chow

[23:31] *** jrtayloriv joined
[23:32] <Juerd> In Rakudo's source, I've acked for ::=, and it appears that it isn't actually used, whereas := is.

[23:32] <Juerd> But maybe this just means that ::= isn't implemented yet. Haven't checked the list. Don't even know if there is one.

[23:45] *** justatheory joined
[23:47] <TimToady> I think we still have the context trait, but $*foo variables automatically get it set, along with $_, $/, and $!

[23:48] <Juerd> What is "virtually identical" in practice?

[23:50] <wayland76> "quite different"? :)
