[09:40] <jaffa8> I downloaded parrot-win32 binary

[09:40] <jaffa8> and rakudo

[09:40] <jaffa8> but it does not work

[09:55] <cognominal> can you be more specific?

[09:56] <jaffa8> I can

[09:56] <jaffa8> I get an error when I run per6.exe

[09:56] <jaffa8> perl6.exe

[09:57] <jaffa8> cognominal,well?

[09:58] <moritz_> it looks like somebody[tm] missed a 'make install-dev' while building the packages.

[09:58] <moritz_> jaffa8: you can download and build it yourself, see http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo for instructions

[09:59] <jaffa8> I tried

[09:59] <jaffa8> that too

[09:59] <jaffa8> I get parrot_install is not recognised

[09:59] <moritz_> that seems... odd

[10:00] <moritz_> jaffa8: did the path to your build directory contain whitespaces?

[10:00] <moritz_> if so, you might try with a path without whitespaces

[10:00] <jaffa8> no

[10:00] <moritz_> we've had problems with that before

[10:00] <jaffa8> I use version 1.4

[10:00] <moritz_> and which rakudo?

[10:01] *** bpetering joined
[10:01] <jaffa8> rakudo-2009-08

[10:01] <moritz_> you need parrot-1.5 for that

[10:01] <jaffa8> so which rakudo version can I use?

[10:02] <moritz_> 2009-07 works with parrot-1.4

[10:02] <moritz_> phenny: tell alester when I log in to rakudo.org I only see blank pages - any ideas?

[10:13] *** payload joined
[10:13] <moritz_> we re-worked much of the build process for the 2009-08 release; if you have the option to use parrot-1.5 you should also try to use the latest rakudo

[10:17] <jaffa8> ok

[10:25] <jaffa8> Is not possible to use a variable without declaring it?

[11:06] <jnthn> Pseudo-assignment to an attribute declaration specifies the default

[11:06] <jnthn> value.  The value on the right is treated as an implicit closure and

[11:06] <jnthn> evaluated at object build time, that is, when the object is being

[11:06] <jnthn> constructed, not when class is being composed. 

[11:07] <masak> right.

[11:07] <jnthn> I think Rakudo is doing that correctly.

[11:07] <masak> and then it goes on to describe ways around that, with BEGIN et al.

[11:07] <jnthn> has $.r = BEGIN { rand }; # would mean we compute the value at BEGIN time and just shove that into the closure, I guess.

[11:08] <masak> but I'm starting to see that this is not inconsistent with what you said about attributes not being available to type objects.

[11:08] <masak> ok, here's my use case instead; maybe we'll be able to find a way to do that.

[11:08] <jnthn> masak: Right, we don't do the assignment in any way at compose time.

[11:08] <masak> I have a couple of class-wide parameter defaults. I'd like to store those in the class.

[11:09] <jnthn> masak: It's just that instead of the implicit closure being { rand } it is instead { BEGIN { rand } }

[11:09] <masak> before a couple of minutes ago, I thought I could store those as instance variables.

[11:10] <masak> but that doesn't work, becase I call my methods on the type object sometimes, and they have to be available then.

[11:10] <jnthn> class Foo { our $.bar is rw }; my $x = Foo.new; my $y = Foo.new; $x.bar = 10; say $y.bar

[11:10] <jnthn> rakudo:class Foo { our $.bar is rw }; my $x = Foo.new; my $y = Foo.new; $x.bar = 10; say $y.bar

[11:10] <masak> hm. :) I think I have an idea. I'll have to store the constants as lexicals instead, and then initialize them to the attributes. yeah, that works. it's three levels instead of two, but it has the advantage of working.

[11:11] <jnthn> Is that the semantics you want?

[11:11] <jnthn> rakudo: class Foo { our $.bar is rw }; my $x = Foo.new; my $y = Foo.new; $x.bar = 10; say $y.bar

[11:11] <p6eval> rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´10‚ê§¬ª

[11:11] <masak> no.

[11:11] <masak> let me whip up an example.

[11:13] <missingthepoint> masak: here's something that is relevant for the channel

[11:13] <masak> :)

[11:13] <missingthepoint> why is there no use_ok() in Test.pm?

[11:13] <missingthepoint> I want one. I'm willing to create one but got stuck.

[11:13] <masak> missingthepoint: maybe that's why. :)

[11:14] <missingthepoint> :)

[11:15] <masak> rakudo: class A { my $foo-default = 42; has $!foo; method bar(:$foo is copy) { if !$foo.defined { $foo = $foo-default }; say $foo } }; A.bar(); A.bar(:foo(43)); A.new(:foo(44)).bar

[11:15] <p6eval> rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´42‚ê§43‚ê§42‚ê§¬ª

[11:16] <masak> jnthn: there's a partial implementation of my idea. I want it to say 42, 43, 44.

[11:17] <masak> ah, here:

[11:17] <masak> rakudo: class A { my $foo-default = 42; has $!foo; method bar(:$foo is copy) { if !$foo.defined { $foo = self.WHICH == A.WHICH ?? $foo-default !! $!foo }; say $foo } }; A.bar(); A.bar(:foo(43)); A.new(:foo(44)).bar

[11:17] <p6eval> rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´42‚ê§43‚ê§44‚ê§¬ª

[11:18] <masak> (is there a better way to say "am I an instantiated object?")

[11:18] <masak> self.defined, perhaps?

[11:18] <jnthn> self.defined, yes

[11:18] <jnthn> also, why .WHICH?

[11:18] <jnthn> === calls .WHICH on each side.

[11:19] <masak> oh, ah.

[11:19] <jnthn> And you probably can't trust it to be something you can numerically compare.

[11:19] <jnthn> Plus it makes your code shorter. :-)

[11:19] <masak> rakudo: class A { my $foo-default = 42; has $!foo; method bar(:$foo is copy) { if !$foo.defined { $foo = self === A ?? $foo-default !! $!foo }; say $foo } }; A.bar(); A.bar(:foo(43)); A.new(:foo(44)).bar

[11:19] <p6eval> rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´42‚ê§43‚ê§44‚ê§¬ª

[11:19] <masak> for some reason, using === rather than self.defined feels safer.

[11:20] <masak> someone could be mucking with the .defined method.

[11:20] <jnthn> True.

[11:21] <jnthn> Anyway, looks like lexical in the class is the solution you wanted. :-)

[11:21] <masak> yes.

[11:21] <masak> and fewer Null PMC accesses in general. :P

[11:26] <Matt-W> o/

[11:26] <masak> o/

[11:27] <masak> oh, I'll probably have to go with .defined despite its overridability... the === solution doesn't handle subclassing very well.

[11:27] * Matt-W is enjoying free wifi at st pancras international

[11:29] <Matt-W> hmm

[11:29] <Matt-W> interesting fun with methods there masak

[11:29] <Matt-W> You're trying to make something which behaves in some sane manner called on both the class and on an instance?

[11:29] <masak> more or less, yes.

[11:30] <masak> it's kind of a pattern I see emerging with modules/classes.

[11:30] <masak> the idea is that some defaults are provided for you, but you can override them by instantiating -- or by passing arguments.

[11:30] <masak> the former has the advantage that you get an object with your defaults.

[11:31] <Matt-W> yeah

[11:31] <Matt-W> sounds interesting

[11:31] <Matt-W> if you develop it properly, make sure you blog about it

[11:31] <Matt-W> we need thoughts out there about perl 6 design

[11:31] <Matt-W> as in, how to write stuff using it rather than how to design the language itself

[11:32] <masak> Matt-W: yes. this will definitely become a blog post.

[11:32] <Matt-W> hurrah

[11:35] *** pmurias joined
[11:37] <jnthn> masak: You could always hack up a trait.

[11:37] <jnthn> This nearly works:

[11:37] <jnthn> multi trait_mod:<is>(AttributeDeclarand $a, $value, :$type-object-valued) { my $accessor_name = $a.name.substr(2); my $meth = method { self.defined ?? $value !! eval($a.name) }; $a.how.add_method($a.how, $accessor_name, $meth);

[11:37] <jnthn> }

[11:37] <jnthn> oh fail

[11:37] <pmurias> what's the state of MAD?

[11:38] <jnthn> http://gist.github.com/172753

[11:38] <Matt-W> jnthn: I found your blog post on custom traits very interesting

[11:38] <jnthn> pmurias: Well, Russia and the US are both still there...

[11:38] <Matt-W> jnthn: I may have a use for those soon...

[11:38] <masak> jnthn: cool!

[11:38] <jnthn> masak: You'll never guess why it doesn't actually work though. :-/

[11:38] <pmurias> jnthn: meant the stuff in perl5 for translation to perl 6

[11:39] <jnthn> pmurias: ;-)

[11:39] <masak> jnthn: no, probably not.

[11:39] <jnthn> pmurias: I'm not so sure...I seem to remember hearing that it wasn't been maintained as much as it maybe needed to be from somewhere...

[11:40] <jnthn> That may just be because it's not being used all that much at the moment though.

[11:40] <jnthn> masak: The eval to get the attribute value is has a fail.

[11:40] <jnthn> masak: Because eval doesn't realize we're inside of a class.

[11:40] <jnthn> :-/

[11:40] <masak> :(

[11:40] <jnthn> I'm not really sure what to do about that.

[11:41] <Matt-W> :(

[11:41] <Matt-W> eval needs to be more aware of its calling environment?

[11:41] <jnthn> Actually, it's the same issue we have with .perl

[11:41] <jnthn> In terms of wanting a general solution.

[11:41] <reqamst> masak: I was testing this things from S12 to implement method_missing, but it doesn't work :(

[11:41] <masak> jnthn: well, I currently have this, which is pretty nice: http://gist.github.com/172758

[11:41] <jnthn> That is, there's no way to actually get at the attribute storage.

[11:41] <jnthn> From Perl 6.

[11:41] <masak> reqamst: sorry to hear that. maybe submit a TODO ticket?

[11:42] <jnthn> We all know we can from inline PIR.

[11:42] <Matt-W> oh

[11:42] <Matt-W> hmm

[11:42] <Matt-W> that is a bit of a problem

[11:42] <reqamst> masak: I still could parse $!, but I think it's wrong way

[11:43] <reqamst> masak: but I will try yet

[11:43] <masak> reqamst: I'm not really following what you're doing here.

[11:44] <jnthn> masak: Not so bad. :-)

[11:44] <reqamst> masak: moment for respite ;)

[11:45] * Matt-W would have used a pointy sub instead of placeholder parameters

[11:45] <masak> jnthn: it doesn't work, though :(

[11:45] <masak> jnthn: (beacuse the arguments to the closure are evaluated unconditionally)

[11:46] <Matt-W> that's a problem?

[11:46] *** cotto joined
[11:46] * Matt-W thinks it looks quite sensible

[11:46] <masak> Matt-W: yes, you're not allowed to speak about $!foo for a type object.

[11:46] <masak> Matt-W: and Rakudo punishes you with a Null PMC access right now.

[11:46] <Matt-W> oooh of course

[11:46] <Matt-W> the moment you pass $!foo to the closure it's going to try and look it up

[11:47] <masak> yes :(

[11:47] <jnthn> And you can nee eval it because... :-(

[11:47] <Matt-W> you need a way to write subroutines which can shortcut their own arguments...

[11:47] <Matt-W> MACRO TIME

[11:47] <Matt-W> :P

[11:48] <jnthn> Oh, just wrap it up in a closure. :-P

[11:48] <Matt-W> yeah I was about to suggest that

[11:48] <masak> er.

[11:48] <jnthn> Unpretty though.

[11:48] <Matt-W> but if yo udid it with a macro it could do that for you

[11:48] <jnthn> Right.

[11:48] <Matt-W> it *would* defer evaluation :)

[11:48] <jnthn> Which would be pretty.

[11:48] <masak> I think I'll just go the way of an if/else statement.

[11:48] <jnthn> Mmm. Pretty.

[11:48] <Matt-W> well get on with implementing them then :)

[11:49] <Matt-W> forget this rakudo star thing, we want a mungeable grammar

[11:51] <rdice> (now appears to be the time for the Europeans to bid good morning to the N'Americans who are just in the process of waking up.)

[11:51] <Matt-W> yup

[11:51] <Matt-W> and nearly time for me to go get my train

[11:51] <jaffa8> How I make a label in Perl 6?

[11:52] <masak> jaffa8: just like in Perl 5.

[11:52] <jnthn> Matt-W: Going anywhere exciting?

[11:52] <jnthn> Matt-W: Is the train British^Wdelayed? ;-)

[11:52] <jaffa8> I get a syntax error

[11:52] <Matt-W> jnthn: going home, and it's british but currently showing as on time

[11:52] <masak> jaffa8: in Rakudo?

[11:53] <jnthn> Matt-W: Wow. ;-)

[11:53] <Matt-W> the eurostar seems to be running on time too

[11:53] <Matt-W> astonishing

[11:53] <Matt-W> I have, so far, been very lucky with travel

[11:53] <jaffa8> masak, in Rakudo

[11:53] *** Front_slash left
[11:53] <Matt-W> yesterday was flawless

[11:53] <masak> jaffa8: that's because labels are not implemented yet.

[11:53] <Matt-W> today so far has only been marred by an impatient american demanding of me why the train stopped for so long at Redhill

[11:53] <Matt-W> as if I look like I'd know...

[11:53] <jnthn> Yeah, but the Eurostar is run half by the French too, who actually run a decent railway network in my experience, on the days they aren't on strike. ;-)

[11:53] <Matt-W> true

[11:54] <jaffa8> Matt-W, where is Red Hill?

[11:54] <cognominal> italian and british train are late, french one are on strike!

[11:54] <Matt-W> Redhill is in Surrey

[11:54] <Matt-W> not far south of London

[11:54] <rdice> jnthn:  there appears to be a universal law of conservation of annoyance at play in your observation.

[11:55] <jnthn> rdice: There's always *something* to complain about, y'know. :-)

[11:55] <jaffa8> masak, that is bad, my hopes were greater than this

[11:55] <rdice> Complaining is your own choice.  Annoyance is what the universe gives onto you without your input in the matter.

[11:55] <carlin> if there was nothing to complain about you could complain about having nothing to complain about

[11:55] <Matt-W> jnthn: at the moment I'm anticipating getting back to Nottingham and discovering that the trams are broken and the cat's trashed the house

[11:56] <masak> jaffa8: well, it's a volunteer effort. not everything can be done at once.

[11:56] <masak> jaffa8: you are very welcome to help.

[11:56] <jnthn> Surely a cat wouldn't do such a thing? ;-)

[11:56] <jnthn> They look so cute and innocent.

[11:56] <jaffa8> masak, I read the someone is sponsoring it

[11:56] <Matt-W> errrr

[11:57] <Su-Shee> jnthn: you have no idea what this 2 kg fluffballs are capable of. ;)

[11:57] *** Front_slash joined
[11:57] <masak> jaffa8: yes, someone is sponsoring it.

[11:57] <cognominal> Part of the line of rapid transit system  is owned RATP and the other by  SNCF (subway company and railway company) so I have twice the chance to have problem with strikes.

[11:57] <masak> jaffa8: the bottleneck is still developer hours, however.

[11:57] <jnthn> jaffa8: Yes, that still doesn't give us infinite resources. :-)

[11:57] <Matt-W> it gives us a lot more than it would otherwise...

[11:57] <jaffa8> the task is finite.

[11:57] <masak> jaffa8: but not small.

[11:57] <jnthn> Sure, so are our resources.

[11:58] <cognominal> And this is the one that links Orly airport and Xharles de Gaulle airport too...

[11:58] *** abra joined
[11:59] <jnthn> jaffa8: The other thing is that a decent bit of things that do get added are in response to things people developing stuff on Rakudo actually run into (or at least, such things get a priority boost quite often). Labels from what I've heard just aren't missed *that* much.

[11:59] <jnthn> So haven't ever really risen that high on the todo list yet.

[11:59] <Matt-W> Right, I'll be back in four hours or so

[11:59] <Matt-W> o/

[11:59] <jnthn> Matt-W: Safe travels. o/

[12:00] <masak> jaffa8: out of curiosity, what is it you need labels for?

[12:01] <jaffa8> I am trying to convert an old perl 5 program

[12:01] <jnthn> .oO( also I've no clue how we're going to implement labels... )

[12:01] <jaffa8> it contains copy sub

[12:01] <jaffa8> I think I copied it from File::Copy

[12:01] <jaffa8> that contained some labels.

[12:01] <jnthn> Aha.

[12:01] <jaffa8> It used for error handling

[12:02] <jaffa8> e.g.   close(TO)   || goto fail_open2 if $closeto;

[12:03] <jaffa8> Is Pugs better?

[12:04] <Juerd> g...g...goto?

[12:05] <masak> jaffa8: I'm sure we can do better than goto for error handling. :)

[12:05] <jnthn> jaffa8: To be honest, looking at that line of code suggests to me that there's probably a better way to write such things in Perl 6 that don't require labels / goto.

[12:05] <jnthn> jaffa8: Perl 6 has CATCH blocks, for example, so exception handling is more workable.

[12:07] <jaffa8> ok

[12:08] <moritz_> jnthn: btw I also experience blank pages on rakudo.org, after logging in

[12:08] <jnthn> moritz_: Ah!!

[12:08] <jnthn> moritz_: I have auto-login...

[12:08] <jaffa8> Is Pugs better?

[12:08] <Juerd> jaffa8: Did you know, by the way, that using goto for error handling is considered a bad idea in just about any programming language except BASIC?

[12:09] <jaffa8> I did not write the code

[12:09] <Juerd> Doesn't really matter who did it :)

[12:10] <Juerd> You appear to have the privilege of fixing it :)

[12:10] <cognominal> jnthn, trying to understand the empty names.  What is the difference between  .sub '' :method('list')      and .sub list :method    I don't get what says pdd19_pir.pod:240

[12:10] <masak> jaffa8: I'm not so sure Pugs can be said to be better. it's certainly less seen to nowadays.

[12:10] <jnthn> jaffa8: Pugs may handle labels, I'm really not sure... Pugs is not really maintained these days, and has fallen behind with the spec somewhat as a result. Feature wise, it handles a few things Rakudo does not yet, but Rakudo handles various things that Pugs never has.

[12:10] <pmurias> Juerd: goto is used for error handling in the linux kernel

[12:11] <moritz_> it's not maintained in nor developed anymore

[12:11] <cognominal> Juerd, well, in C, goto is very useful to exit many levels of loop

[12:11] <jnthn> Plus Rakudo, since it's actively developed, is catching up on those things.

[12:11] <moritz_> pmurias: yes, because C has no exceptions

[12:11] <Juerd> pmurias: Kernels do ugly things all over the place

[12:12] <cognominal> Juerd, I am not speaking of exiting routines, but embedded loops

[12:12] <Juerd> Maybe I should have said "every high level programming language"

[12:12] <Juerd> But then I have to indicate where high level starts :|

[12:12] <cognominal> ...within a function

[12:13] <jnthn> cognominal: I guess the difference is in the namespace entry it gets...

[12:13] <jnthn> That is, it only ends up as a method, but not in the NS.

[12:13] <pmurias> Juerd: if a bad thing happens while you initialise stuff a goto is the best way in C to jump to the abropriate place in the deinitalisation sequence

[12:13] <cognominal> jnthn, so why do you vary between the two styles?

[12:14] <Juerd> pmurias: I'm not sure I could ever code C.

[12:14] <jnthn> cognominal: We generally don't use the :method('name') one much at the moment...

[12:15] *** Front_slash left
[12:15] <jnthn> cognominal: But really there's some clean-up to do there.

[12:16] * jnthn afk for a bit

[12:16] <cognominal> ok, so there is no relationship with the empty method names as per ,^methods

[12:22] <masak> which documentation?

[12:23] <jaffa8> http://dev.perl.org/perl6/rfc/63.html

[12:23] <masak> jaffa8: that's not documentation, that's an RFC.

[12:23] <masak> jaffa8: those are suggestions from nine years ago about what should end up in the language.

[12:23] <masak> not all features were accepted, and even those that were were often changed in significant ways.

[12:24] <jaffa8> should try be in uppercase too?

[12:24] <masak> jaffa8: no.

[12:24] <jaffa8> only the catch?

[12:24] <moritz_> go to http://perl6-projects.org/ and follow the links for Specification and Documentation

[12:24] <masak> jaffa8: what moritz_ said. they explain it better and more compactly.

[12:24] <masak> jaffa8: the things about try and CATCH are in S04.

[12:25] <missingthepoint> moritz_: if one wants to test a .parse method, should one rely on .perl, or is is_deeply() in Test.pm better?

[12:26] <moritz_> missingthepoint: .perl is not suited for comparison, because it doesn't sort hash keys

[12:26] <moritz_> I don't know how well is_deeply() deals with Match objects.

[12:26] <missingthepoint> ah. that's all i need to know (.perl is insufficient)

[12:27] <masak> moritz_: I know there isn't any logic in is_deeply() for Match objects.

[12:27] <missingthepoint> (we don't need to deal with Match objects, because generally we can test individual fields)

[12:27] <masak> so probably not that well. but I imagine it could be adapted to deal well with them.

[12:27] <moritz_> infix:<eqv> doesn't handle it either.

[12:28] <missingthepoint> masak: I think testing Match objects for Text::CSV would be testing implementation. I think .fields is the interface, no?

[12:28] <masak> missingthepoint: I currently only expose things through .parse and .parse-file

[12:29] <masak> I'm not sure .fields makes sense, since the object doesn't store the parse.

[12:29] *** explorer__ joined

[12:31] <missingthepoint> why did you go the direction you did?

[12:31] <jaffa8> Does local exist in Perl 6?

[12:39] <jaffa8> sub extract_idfo;

[12:41] <cognominal> they are necessary for multisub so that signatures are available for dispatch purposes

[12:41] <pmurias> jaffa8: they aren't nessesary in perl5

[12:41] <pmurias> jaffa8: and neither they are in perl6

[12:42] <cognominal> otherwise I suppose you can (must?) use parentheses to mean a sub call without parameters

[12:42] <pmurias> perl6: foo;sub foo {say "hi there"}

[12:42] <p6eval> elf 28048, pugs, rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´hi there‚ê§¬ª

[12:42] <pmurias> cognominal: you meant that something like that?

[12:43] <missingthepoint> hmm, i didn't expect that to work :)

[12:43] <cognominal> yes, you just precised what I meant to say.

[12:46] <duke_leto> uhm‚Ä¶ Why does ‚Äú@array = []; say +@array;‚Äù produce 1 ‚Äì and ‚Äú@array = (); say +@array;‚Äù produce 0? Is that intentional?

[12:48] <cognominal> rakudo:  my @array=[];  say @array.perl

[12:48] <p6eval> rakudo 0d4fe0: OUTPUT¬´[[]]‚ê§¬ª

[12:48] <cognominal> duke_leto, you get it?  :)

[12:49] <jnthn> duke_leto: [] constructs an array, () a list.

[12:49] <duke_leto> I see‚Ä¶ this creates an array of an empty array.

[12:49] <jnthn> duke_leto: You can think of [] a bit like an array ref in Perl 5 - it won't flatten.

[12:49] <jnthn> Correct.

[12:50] <duke_leto> How would I ‚Äúreset‚Äù an array? The situation is, I use an array many times, but want to make it empty at one point.

[13:24] <masak> September 2005? that late?

[13:24] <duke_leto> Hm‚Ä¶

[13:25] <duke_leto> don‚Äôt regexes with unicode work yet?

[13:25] <moritz_> they do

[13:25] <duke_leto> Or what is wrong with /‚Üê/ ?? :-(

[13:25] <moritz_> duke_leto: since ‚Üê is not alphanumeric you need to escape or quote it

[13:26] <duke_leto> oh‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know that. so /\‚Üê/ should work?

[13:26] <moritz_> the first mention of "optimized for fun" is from 2005-07-19

[13:26] <moritz_> duke_leto: yes

[13:26] <masak> duke_leto: you have to escape non-alphanumerics.

[13:26] <masak> aye.

[13:27] <masak> moritz_: ok, that lends it a bit more credibility.

[13:27] <duke_leto> thanks moritz_ & masak :-)

[13:28] * masak bows

[13:28] <Su-Shee> I've started to change perl6-projects.org again to make it scale better for more information and to be the central website.

[13:28] <Su-Shee> so I separated it by "subjects". 

[13:29] <Su-Shee> http://sushee.no-ip.org/p6p/ 

[13:29] <Su-Shee> idea is: easy and fast startpage - details and more information on subpages.

[13:29] <Su-Shee> (which can be longer, more details and as extensive as they need to be.)

[13:32] <Su-Shee> (imagine it more shiny, please and with a navigation menu on the subpages and stuff.. ;)

[13:33] <masak> Su-Shee: I'm slightly doubtful that moving the links away from the main page is an improvement.

[13:33] <masak> Su-Shee: right now what I like about the page is that it's everything-at-once.

[13:33] <masak> you don't have to click to somewhere else to get more information; it's all there.

[13:34] <Su-Shee> masak: on the "all in one page", stuff can't be easily added in the future or the page will break or you have to scroll.. 

[13:34] *** rafl left
[13:35] <Su-Shee> and it all points elsewhere. nothing more on perl6-projects.org

[13:35] <masak> I think I like the improved Camelia, though. only thing is that the shinier she gets, the more jarring the 'P' and the '6' look.

[13:35] <masak> Su-Shee: yes, I understand your concern too. it's definitely a tradeoff of some kind.

[13:35] <moritz_> TimToady will complain about the TM being removed again ;-)

[13:36] <Su-Shee> old image, I can add it again. ;)

[13:36] *** Limbic_Region joined
[13:36] <moritz_> masak, Su-Shee: there might be a compromise...

[13:36] <moritz_> include the first 3 or for links for each section

[13:36] <moritz_> and then have 'more' link

[13:37] <moritz_> that in the standard version loads the appropriate sub page

[13:37] <wayland76> phenny: tell pmichaud I just found a possibly useful tool: rpmdev-bumpspec which claims to "Bump revision in specfile".  It comes in the fedora package rpmdevtools

[13:37] <phenny> wayland76: I'll pass that on when pmichaud is around.

[13:37] <Su-Shee> ok, easily done. I would make it the "most important three links" though, not just the "first three"

[13:37] <moritz_> and if javascript is enabled, it include a longer list in-place

[13:37] <masak> Su-Shee: sure, it all points elsewhere. maybe I should have said "you're intriducing one more level of indirection" to express my concern with the new design.

[13:37] <masak> suddenly it sounds like something that should be generated...

[13:38] <masak> I like that.

[13:38] <masak> as long as it degrades gracefully.

[13:38] <Su-Shee> My thinking was along the lines of making perl6-projects.org the center piece of perl6 websites. which I assume to be extensive in the future and contain much more stuff and many examples and documentation.

[13:38] *** JimmyZ joined
[13:39] <moritz_> it should be the center, yes

[13:39] <missingthepoint> how about a compromise? have a lightbox effect with the "most important info" from each subpage?

[13:40] <moritz_> and I agree with Su-Shee that the current design and concept doesn't scale enough

[13:40] <Su-Shee> the first three links/three most important links and a more thingie would also fit...

[13:41] <masak> missingthepoint: moritz_ is way ahead of you. :)

[13:41] <Su-Shee> think about next year having 40 tutorials and many exmaple code pages and a perl 6 forum for example.

[13:41] <JimmyZ> Maigao, wanshanghao.

[13:42] <missingthepoint> masak: "lightbox" is superset of "javascript longer list-in-place"... it's a specific way of implementing that :)

[13:43] <masak> missingthepoint: oh; I did not know that.

[13:43] <moritz_> general things first, specifics later.

[13:43] <Su-Shee> first, let's decide wether/not separate the pages/subjects. the "more" technology and design can come later :)

[13:43] <masak> moritz_++ # JDFI

[13:43] <missingthepoint> indeed. i agree the current design, while excellent, isn't scaley.

[13:44] <moritz_> what missingthepoint said.

[13:44] <JimmyZ> masak: Don't you foget your chinese name? ;)

[13:44] *** zloyrusskiy joined
[13:44] <Su-Shee> and it's difficult to read and to understand.

[13:45] <moritz_> so I agree with Su-Shee's concept (barring a few minor details which we'll surely resolve)

[13:45] <masak> JimmyZ: it's È∫¶È´ò. why do you ask? :)

[13:45] <JimmyZ> I typed Maigao ;)

[13:46] <masak> JimmyZ: sorry, I wasn't paying attention. :/

[13:46] <JimmyZ> masak: haha

[13:46] <masak> I'm eating lunch while glancing at the IRC window. Maigao didn't get highlighted.

[13:47] <masak> JimmyZ: Êôö‰∏äÂ•Ω.

[13:47] <Su-Shee> moritz_: I also like to weed out links a little. Do we really have to link old stuff which hasn't been updated for three years?

[13:47] <JimmyZ> masak: you're working hard on #perl ;)

[13:48] <moritz_> Su-Shee: you mean pugs?

[13:48] <masak> JimmyZ++ # keeping my ÊôÆÂêåËØù alive

[13:48] <masak> JimmyZ: I am?

[13:48] <Su-Shee> moritz_: in two years, I also mean pugs, but right now for example u4x

[13:48] <JimmyZ> masak: yes

[13:49] <JimmyZ> masak: typo, it's ÊôÆÈÄöËØù.

[13:49] <moritz_> Su-Shee: u4x is being worked on, though the blog post wasn't updated - maybe we need something better to link to

[13:49] <masak> Su-Shee: I think u4x could be seen as relevant still.

[13:49] <Su-Shee> ok.

[13:49] <JimmyZ> masak: Had you seen pinyin.sogou.com? the almost best pinyin shurufa.

[13:50] <masak> JimmyZ: ah, thanks. I hesitated between those two.

[13:50] <masak> JimmyZ: will check it out.

[13:50] <moritz_> Su-Shee: but in general, maybe we should have a page about historic Perl 6, linking to the apocalypsis, exegesis, RFC, pugs, etc.

[13:50] <Su-Shee> moritz_: I also like to add existing Perl6/Rakudo modules as long as this is a handful stuff on github

[13:51] <masak> but my shurufa right now is Emacs.

[13:51] <Su-Shee> moritz_: which can be removed when it all moves to cpan.

[13:51] <masak> Su-Shee: projects.list in proto contains a comprehensive list.

[13:51] <moritz_> Su-Shee: it's more than a handful

[13:52] <masak> definitely more than a handful.

[13:52] <masak> the past month has been especially prolific.

[13:52] <Su-Shee> moritz_ / masak than it has to be listed on p6p. 

[13:52] <JimmyZ> masak: ÊôÆÈÄöËØù means universal-common-use-language. not universal-same-use-language.

[13:52] <masak> JimmyZ: ah; of course.

[13:53] <masak> Su-Shee: sure, feel free to link to http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/master/projects.list

[13:53] <missingthepoint> does anyone know of an IRC client with font replacement? I want to see JimmyZ's chars.

[13:54] <JimmyZ> missingthepoint: chatzilla

[13:54] <Su-Shee> masak: actually I want to link every single project. easy click and access and such. 

[13:54] <Su-Shee> missingthepoint: irsii is perfectly capable of unicode if your terminal is :)

[13:54] <JimmyZ> missingthepoint: or see irclog with firebox 

[13:55] <masak> Su-Shee: there's a clear risk of duplicated efforts there.

[13:55] <mikehh> rakudo (e83932a) builds on parrot r40715 - make test/make spectest (up to 28048) PASS - Ubuntu 9.04 amd64 (g++)

[13:55] <masak> Su-Shee: couldn't one generate something from projects.list instead?

[13:55] <JimmyZ> missingthepoint: chatzilla is well supporting utf-8

[13:55] <Su-Shee> masak: sure. 

[13:56] <masak> JimmyZ: now the problem for me with sites like http://pinyin.sogou.com/ is that I'm not proficient enough to navigate through a jungle of hanzi :/

[13:56] <moritz_> masak: any objections to adding an abstract line to each module in projects.list?

[13:56] *** molaf joined
[13:56] <Su-Shee> masak: and the risk of dublicated effort right now weighs IMHO the value of having something to show easily. if this is up to let's say a hundret projects, it's time to cpanize anyway.

[13:56] <masak> moritz_: not really. but there's one already on github.

[13:56] <JimmyZ> masak: how do type chinese words?

[13:57] <masak> JimmyZ: with Emacs/LEIM.

[13:57] <JimmyZ> masak: s/do/do you/g

[13:57] <masak> Su-Shee: it's time to cpanize _now_. we just don't have that option available.

[13:57] <Su-Shee> "hrmpf". :)

[13:57] <JimmyZ> masak: what's input method?

[13:57] <masak> Su-Shee: you're free to duplicate all the effort you want. I'm just advising against it.

[13:58] <masak> JimmyZ: it's called LEIM, it's an Emacs package.

[13:58] <masak> JimmyZ: ah, I type Pinyin.

[13:58] <masak> JimmyZ: I also have wubi as an option.

[13:58] <masak> but I don't master wubi yet.

[13:59] <JimmyZ> masak: http://pinyin.sogou.com/ is pinyin, if you're on windows.

[13:59] <masak> JimmyZ: I'm not.

[13:59] <JimmyZ> I think it's hard to use wubi for you( and me ).

[13:59] *** cotto left
[14:01] <missingthepoint> Can I help clarify? Su-Shee, why do you want easy-click access to every single project? Is it in keeping with the "one site for all perl 6 projects idea"?

[14:01] <masak> I'm on a NetBSD Unix version called Darwin.

[14:01] <masak> JimmyZ: yes, but it seems so much better than pinyin, once you get fast with it.

[14:01] <masak> JimmyZ: actually, now that I think about it, it aligns much more with how TimToady breaks down characters. you type components, not sounds.

[14:01] <masak> Su-Shee: I've long toyed with the idea of making it easy for proto to share it's ecosystem information with the external world.

[14:02] <Su-Shee> masak: meaning for us common folks? :)

[14:02] <masak> Su-Shee: meaning a way to export the info in projects.list via a module.

[14:02] <Su-Shee> missingthepoint: I want a central, cool, easy, hip and shiny and extensive perl 6 website. ;)

[14:02] <masak> Su-Shee++

[14:02] <JimmyZ> masak: at past, wubi is fast than pinyin. but now, It's not certain.

[14:03] <masak> JimmyZ: why? what changed?

[14:03] <JimmyZ> the pinyin of brainpower.

[14:04] <missingthepoint> Su-Shee: well then maybe the "perl6-projects" part of the domain is misleading. maybe you really want to build "perl6-central.org"? :)

[14:04] <JimmyZ> especially http://pinyin.sogou.com/

[14:04] * masak is fine with perl6-projects

[14:04] <moritz_> missingthepoint: well, perl6.org would be awesome.

[14:05] <masak> it's intentionally dual-sense: projects that *are* Perl 6, or projects that *use* Perl 6.

[14:05] <wayland76> It sounds like CPAN-for-perl-6 :)

[14:06] * masak sighs

[14:06] <masak> if I had a nickel for every time someone mentionas a CPAN for Perl 6... :P

[14:07] <jnthn> ...you might be able to hire somebody to create one? ;-)

[14:08] <masak> jnthn: very possibly.

[14:09] <jnthn> masak: What do you see as the main blockers to having something "CPAN for Perl 6"-like?

[14:09] <masak> someone who accepts payment in nickels.

[14:09] <jnthn> lol

[14:10] <missingthepoint> moritz_: it would be awesome, in the "nothing-left-to-take-away" ideal name sense. plus .org for the volunteer aspect.

[14:11] <jnthn> masak: Seriously though. Is it just somebody sitting down and writing something and saying, "try this, and if you don't like things about it hack on it?"

[14:12] <Su-Shee> missingthepoint: actually I don't care how the domain is called. as far as I'm concerned, it could be cutecutsycamelia.org :) but right know, everything perl 6 is hidden "somewhere", totally spread over the internet and for noone but a few people here transparent. I'm here more or less daily and I missed masak's list for example. and this is no good if people really are supposed to start with perl 6.

[14:13] <moritz_> Su-Shee++ # this was why I started p6p in the first place

[14:13] <missingthepoint> first, moritz++ for starting p6p.org.

[14:14] <Su-Shee> therefore I want EASY access to _everything_ p6-ish. with clear subjects which are important: how to get it, how to code with it, how to find documentation and how to meet people.

[14:14] <missingthepoint> Su-Shee: domain name matters. cutecutesycamelia.org can be an alias :P

[14:14] <masak> jnthn: (1) whatever someone writes, it'll be compared against the CPAN we have. some people will argue strongly against writing something new from scratch. (2) whatever someone writes, it'll have to do versions and authorities. not even Rakudo does that yet, so it's still a bit untested and fuzzy how it'll all work.

[14:14] <missingthepoint> Su-Shee: (last point) I could not have said it better.

[14:15] <Su-Shee> and due to the marketing aspect perl desperately needs, I added "perl love" (shiny icons, shirts and so on. And "rakudo starlet" is mine. ;)

[14:16] <masak> jnthn: in short, expectations are high, and it won't be useful until it's been worked on for quite some time.

[14:17] <missingthepoint> Su-Shee: DESPARATELY. we need to actively recruit marketing folk with an interest in programming. how do we do that? <o

[14:18] <jnthn> masak: It feels to me like we have a situation where a lot of people want *something*, but the expectation pressure makes a lot of people also feel they're just not good enough to do anything about it.

[14:18] <masak> yes, definitely Su-Shee++ and moritz_++

[14:18] <masak> our German contributors, putting things in order. :) #addingtostereotypes

[14:18] *** cotto joined
[14:18] <Su-Shee> missingthepoint: we don't really need real marketing folks. a little sense for what works on the internet and a little peek into sucessful projects should be enough. it's not that this is some dark, magical secret. :)

[14:18] <wayland76> regarding CPAN6 or whatever, my contribution is to be working (occasionally) on something that converts metadata into package specifications, in hopes that packages can be automatically built

[14:19] <wayland76> It should be finished before some of the other CPAN stuff is, so they can hopefully use it

[14:19] <jnthn> masak: I'd really love us to have _something_ by Rakudo *.

[14:20] <jnthn> masak: But I think we need the same attitude shift that got us Rakudo *. "Yes, it's not the end of the journey, it's a step on the journey to where we want to be and it's good enough to do some things."

[14:21] <masak> jnthn: perhaps a reasonable effort would be making something slightly more ambitious than proto, but still very limited.

[14:21] <masak> sort of "what's the next step up from proto?"

[14:21] <wayland76> jnthn: I'm not at all sure that a CPAN will be a goer, but maybe we could make a Rakudo Distribution by then :)

[14:21] * missingthepoint thinks jnthn++ has a good point and is willing to help with the 6pan. as long as the '6' is not in the middle of the word.

[14:21] * moritz_ doesn't care a damn what the end result is called, as long as it's awesome ;-)

[14:22] <jnthn> In some senses, I'm not even bothered that we call it CPAN or something related.

[14:22] <missingthepoint> ah, avoid the problem!

[14:22] <jnthn> masak: I agree that would be a worthwhile effort.

[14:22] * Su-Shee neither. and I want it easy and smooth and fool proof. ;)

[14:23] <masak> jnthn: thinking about it, I'd say a central PERL6LIB path (or a database, or whatever) would be the next step up.

[14:23] <masak> jnthn: if it could be generalized to handle multiple authorities, fine, but if not, it's not a show-stopper.

[14:23] <jnthn> missingthepoint: Exactly. If the problem is that nobody wants to work on something in the problem space because Being The Next CPAN is intimidating (which I agree it is), then we probably need to drop the idea of doing the next CPAN, or stop talking aobut it in that senses.

[14:23] * wayland76 hopes that we will distinguish between the 4 or 5 different things that are called CPAN in Perl 5

[14:24] <jnthn> And just write Useful Tools in that problem space.

[14:24] * moritz_ has an own vision for how to proceed

[14:24] <missingthepoint> Su-Shee: easy and smooth would do for a start... ;)

[14:25] <jnthn> OK, I'm done throwing my metaphorical coffee mug against the channel wall now. :-)

[14:25] <moritz_> 1) contact the current CPAN maintainers if they are willing to extend PAUSE and the distribution network to upload Perl 6 modules, without any indexing or so

[14:25] <Su-Shee> moritz_: and are you telling us? ;)

[14:25] <wayland76> I vote ++ to the idea of figuring out how we lay out the Perl 6 libraries on the file system

[14:25] <Su-Shee> ah, he does. ;)

[14:25] <missingthepoint> moritz_: do share.

[14:25] <wayland76> @karma vote

[14:25] <lambdabot> vote has a karma of 0

[14:25] <moritz_> 2) write a frontend website that lets us search and download Perl 6 cpan modules

[14:25] <moritz_> 3) teach proto to install modules from CPAN mirrors

[14:26] <moritz_> 2 and 3 can be parallelized

[14:26] <Su-Shee> .oO(gee.. a pragmatic solution.. ;)

[14:26] <moritz_> Su-Shee: designed solutions don't get things done.

[14:26] <jnthn> moritz_: So basically we "outsource" the problem of storage and distribution to the current CPAN to make the problem more managable.

[14:26] <moritz_> jnthn: right

[14:26] <Su-Shee> moritz_: "really?" ;)

[14:26] <masak> that makes sense.

[14:26] <masak> but it only works for Perl 6 modules.

[14:27] <wayland76> Bedtime for me.  'night all

[14:27] <masak> wayland76: o/

[14:27] <missingthepoint> night wayland76 :)

[14:27] <jnthn> night wayland76 

[14:27] <jnthn> masak: ...so?

[14:27] <masak> jnthn: oh, nothing. it's pragmatic.

[14:28] <masak> but sooner or later we'll want to store modules from other HLLs somewhere.

[14:28] <masak> and our Perl 6 modules will start having them as dependencies.

[14:29] *** Psyche^ joined
[14:29] <moritz_> masak: I think that's something we worry about when we get to it

[14:29] <jnthn> masak: I don't think we need to assume we're going to create one solution now that lasts us forever.

[14:29] <Su-Shee> yeah, but wouldn't want the ruby folks stay within their gem-realm, for example? instead of switching to something cpan-ish?

[14:29] <masak> moritz_, jnthn: ack.

[14:29] <moritz_> if our stuff is largely independent of CPAN, we can still use some kind of CDN as a backend

[14:30] <jnthn> moritz_: That too.

[14:31] <jnthn> Su-Shee: I think until Ruby on Parrot gets to a point where it can start to excite the Ruby community in a larger sense, that's probably going to be too hypothetical to get a really good handle on how the community would feel.

[14:32] * moritz_ agrees

[14:33] <missingthepoint> where is Ruby on Parrot, figuratively? Any major blockers?

[14:34] <jnthn> missingthepoint: I've no idea on completeness. It has active development.

[14:34] <masak> missingthepoint: we should start using it and getting a feel for ourselves. :)

[14:35] <masak> missingthepoint: ok, you have a point. priorities.

[14:41] <japhb> masak, happened to glance in, noticed you were talking about CPAN, gems, proto, etc.  What's the summary so far and/or when did the conversation start?  (Working on Parrot's module ecosystem was my planned top task for tomorrow, so this is opportune.)

[14:44] *** Patterner left
[14:44] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[14:45] <masak> japhb: summary: many people suggested many nice ideas. the rough consensus seems to be that we're not equipped to build the 100-year solution, but we can piggyback existing stuff (including CPAN) to have something pretty nice for April.

[14:45] <missingthepoint> japhb: jnthn thinks some kind of Perl-6-module-dist-system by Rakudo * would be nice, and that recontextualizing the problem would help.

[14:46] <japhb> jnthn, "recontextualizing the problem"?  What did you mean by that?

[14:47] <japhb> masak, this sounds a lot like the consensus we came to on parrot-dev over the last month

[14:47] <jnthn> japhb: From watching discussions, I've seen a lot of "we need CPAN for Perl 6" and yet nobody wanting to approach it because of high expectations, the problem feeling too big and so forth.

[14:47] <masak> (recontextualizing the problem)++ # this is what works

[14:47] <jnthn> japhb: I've been trying to break the idea that we need to create nirvana now.

[14:48] <japhb> jnthn, OK, good, the Parrot consensus was "goal: one step above the simplest thing that could possibly work; near-term goal: really the simplest thing that could work"

[14:48] <japhb> jnthn, excellent, thank you.

[14:49] <jnthn> japhb: Well, I really just took what's happened to get us to saying we're going to do Rakudo * and applied the same thinking to the problem. It's nothing original on my part. :-)

[14:49] <jnthn> I think the Parrot consensus is one that is likely to see something actually get done.

[14:50] <masak> japhb: we have proto, the simplest thing that could possibly work. one step above that would be (I think) fixing proto's biggest design flaw: having to care about PERL6LIB.

[14:50] <moritz_> masak: hey, what about actually installing modules?

[14:50] <moritz_> masak: since rakudo can be installed now, that idea starts to make sense to me

[14:50] <masak> moritz_: aye.

[14:51] <missingthepoint> masak: does what wayland76 said earlier play into that?

[14:51] <pugs_svn> r28049 | fglock++ | mp6 update

[14:51] <masak> moritz_: I'd love to see a proof-of-concept of that.

[14:51] * moritz_ just sent a mail to [email@hidden.address]

[14:51] <jnthn> moritz_: Yes, I think installable Rakudo helps us on this.

[14:51] <missingthepoint> masak: "figuring out how we lay out the Perl 6 libraries on the file system"

[14:52] <masak> missingthepoint: yes, that's it.

[14:52] * moritz_ also sent an email to the holder of perl6.org

[14:52] <masak> that's why I'd like a proof-of-concept.

[14:52] <missingthepoint> moritz_: who holds perl6.org? are they friendly?

[14:53] <japhb> (still trying to find the start point of the conversation)

[14:53] <japhb> In the mean time:

[14:53] <moritz_> missingthepoint: Daniel Wright, a perl monger, and CPAN contributor

[14:53] <Su-Shee> moritz_: kk-ing it to you?

[14:53] <moritz_> missingthepoint: never heard of him, but what google turns up makes hope

[14:53] <japhb> Will someone who knows the Rakudo install process be around tomorrow daytime (US Pacific)?

[14:53] <moritz_> Su-Shee: doesn't have to.

[15:30] <missingthepoint> moritz_: though i have my most important piece of advice (don't rely on .perl) already :)

[15:42] <masak> jnthn: from what little I know of Korean, I'm slightly surprised.

[15:42] <jnthn> masak: I think the easiness ends beyond the nice logical writing system. :-)

[15:42] <jnthn> masak: It's all of the different vowels.

[15:42] <jnthn> And the aspirated vs unaspirated consonants.

[15:42] <masak> but I also know starting from English pronunciation makes a lot of other things hard, so...

[15:43] <masak> ah.

[15:43] <jnthn> I guesss with time it'll come to me a bit more.

[15:43] <masak> well, Mandarin has the latter.

[15:43] <masak> I'm not saying I approve, but I think I've gotten the hang of it.

[15:43] <TimToady> stress timing vs syllable timing sometimes gives people trouble

[15:43] <masak> nod.

[15:44] <jnthn> Like the soft consonants in Slavic langauges did...eventually (took on the scale of months).

[15:44] *** JimmyZ joined
[15:44] <masak> TimToady: oh, that too. but I guess that's a problem only when you start picking up speed. which I haven't done with Mandarin yet.

[15:45] <TimToady> the funny thing is, stress timers think syllable timers are talking impossibly fast, and syllable timers think stress timers are talking impossibly fast :)

[15:46] <masak> hahaha

[15:46] * masak can relate to that

[15:46] * jnthn too

[15:46] <TimToady> Spanish sounds fast to English speakers because Spanish is syllable timed, while English sounds fast to Spanish speakers because English is stress timed

[15:50] <jnthn> TimToady: I'm pondering that I should now sync S14 with Rakudo's suggestion for how it looks.

[15:50] <TimToady> where are the types defined?  they blew up std, needless to say :)

[15:50] <jnthn> Heh, I just defined them as classes alongside all of the other built-ins. :-)

[15:51] <japhb> jnthn, yeah, http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-08-22#i_1419156 is a problem.  As is getting stuck in design.  For now, I'm just running on faith that I will produce *something* of value.  If only to give everyone comic relief.  ;-)

[15:51] <jnthn> Didn't find any great need to make them excessively special.

[15:51] <jaffa8> Hi,is perl6 still changing?

[15:51] <TimToady> is perl5 still changing?

[15:52] <jnthn> japhb: I'm quite sure you will. :-)

[15:52] <japhb> jaffa8, iteratively, yes.

[15:52] <jnthn> japhb: Erm, produce something of value that is. ;-)

[15:52] <jaffa8> Why are you asking back?

[15:52] <japhb> jnthn, ;-)

[15:52] <araujo> morning

[15:52] <jaffa8> jaffa8, what is iterratively?

[15:53] <TimToady> ooh, shot yourself in the back with tab completion :)

[15:53] <japhb> jaffa8, TimToady was posing a rhetorical question -- in other words: "Why wouldn't Perl 6 still be changing.  Every other language including Perl 5 is."

[15:53] <masak> jaffa8: when you ask 'is Perl 6 still changing?', it's not really clear what information it is you're interested in.

[15:53] <jaffa8> One way I imagine language development is

[15:54] <masak> jaffa8: there's a word in biology for static, unchanging systems.

[15:54] <jaffa8> that you design it , then you implement it.

[15:54] <jnthn> jaffa8: It doesn't work like that.

[15:54] <TimToady> that's called the waterfall model, and we don't

[15:54] <masak> jaffa8: also known as 'waterfall development'

[15:54] <masak> jaffa8: see S01.

[15:54] <jaffa8> What is yours, incremental development?

[15:54] <japhb> jaffa8, iteratively means (roughly) changing bit by bit.  In the design sense, it means making changes over time in reaction to needs and circumstance.

[15:54] <TimToady> the problem with the waterfall model is that you have to be smart, and none of us are that smart

[15:55] <masak> not just smart, but fatally stubborn in the face of new findings.

[15:55] <japhb> Omniscient, one would say.

[15:56] <TimToady> so we merely attempt to converge

[15:56] <masak> all I can say is I like the Perl 6 of 2009 much better than the one of 2004.

[15:56] <jaffa8> but then you do not know when it ends.

[15:56] <TimToady> you can know when it's good enough, however

[15:56] <masak> jaffa8: that's correct.

[15:56] <japhb> Ubiquity--  # Use it to get to a web site, have it ask the stupid question "Did you know that you have a Ubiquity command for this website?"

[15:56] <masak> jaffa8: is there a problem?

[15:56] <M_o_C> masak: You're the one developing Web.pm, right?

[15:56] <jaffa8> I wanted to learn Perl 6

[15:57] <masak> M_o_C: one of a handful, yes.

[15:57] <jaffa8> but I am afraid that it may change again.

[15:57] <M_o_C> Or at least the one who started it...

[15:57] <TimToady> in that sense, perl 5 hasn't "ended" either, hence my original question

[15:57] <masak> jaffa8: I don't think that fear should stop you from learning the language. it's not like we change 90% or so, more like 0.01%.

[15:57] <japhb> jaffa8, The only way improvement ends is when a project is dead.  Live projects change.  In fact, on computer projects of all forms, "Maintenance" is where the *vast* majority of changes happen.

[15:58] <masak> M_o_C: I'm one of three people who applied for a grant, yes.

[15:58] <M_o_C> Will Web.pm include "form generation" routines like p5 CGI.pm did?

[15:58] <masak> M_o_C: I sure hope so.

[15:58] <jaffa8> so there are not going to be big changes anymore

[15:58] <masak> forms are an essential part of Web application building.

[15:59] <TimToady> jaffa8: we're pretty happy with what we have now, so it's mostly just tweaks

[15:59] <masak> jaffa8: it seems you're looking for some point of stability. I'm not sure we're in a position to offer you one. we are in a position to offer you one fine language, and a few interesting implementations of it.

[16:00] <jnthn> TimToady: Basically I have ContainerDeclarand, and a subclass of it AttributeDeclarand. The subclass adds another property, .how, for getting at the metaclass of the thingummy the attribute is being declared on.

[16:00] <jnthn> TimToady: ContainerDeclarand currently just has .container and .name properties, I guess .scope probably makes sense too.

[16:01] <masak> jaffa8: as one who has often been affected by said changes (because I have some code out there), I can tell you it's not so bad when something changes. it's just minor stuff.

[16:01] <jaffa8> ok

[16:02] <japhb> "some code" he says.

[16:02] <jnthn> TimToady: I did ponder whether we might want to have a class per scope declarator but that felt a bit silly.

[16:02] <jnthn> TimToady: And a PITA for anyone who introduces their own...

[16:03] <masak> japhb: it's actually not much. look at giants like ADAMK and you'll agree. :)

[16:03] <M_o_C> masak: Because a few minutes ago I had the realization that those "suggestion" input boxes like e. g. Google uses are essentially comboboxes. And since I think comboboxes are quite useful, I head the idea that you could perhaps implement a routine which would generate the required JavaScript and HTML code.

[16:03] <japhb> masak, ADAMK is doing Perl 6 modules?

[16:03] <jnthn> masak: Yeah but he has an unfair advantage in that he's from the future. ;-)

[16:04] <masak> M_o_C: that's a cool idea. I'd be happy to collaborate with you on that.

[16:04] <masak> japhb: no, but he has a lot of CPAN code.

[16:04] <masak> jnthn: there is that. :)

[16:04] <jaffa8> Is there going to be more types in Perl 6?

[16:04] <jaffa8> I mean basic ones.

[16:04] <masak> jaffa8: Perl 6 has a built-in type system, as opposed to Perl 5.

[16:04] <japhb> masak, he doesn't have to deal with Perl 6 spec changes then.  ;-)

[16:05] <masak> japhb: not that I know of, no. :)

[16:05] <masak> but he has to deal with changes from 5.8 to 5.10, for which I do not envy him at all...

[16:05] <jnthn> jaffa8: By "more types" do you mean "more built-in types"?

[16:05] <jaffa8> yes, like unsigned int, unsigned lnong...

[16:05] <japhb> masak, true

[16:06] <M_o_C> Hehe, problem being, I don't really have much time, don't know Perl 6 and am currently prefer to invest my time in reading docs about Haskell. Plus my JavaScript-fu is almost non-existent...

[16:06] <jnthn> jaffa8: Not unless somehow a big gap is found...

[16:06] <masak> M_o_C: ok. I will at least note your good idea for posterity. hopefully someone will pick it up.

[16:07] <jnthn> jaffa8: But http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/S09-data.pod covers the possibilities pretty well. :-)

[16:07] <M_o_C> Thanks.

[16:08] <jnthn> masak: plz can the next step up from proto not be written in sh? ;-)

[16:08] * jnthn just wanted to try create-new-project...

[16:09] <masak> jnthn: oh. apologies.

[16:09] <jnthn> masak: No worries. :-)

[16:09] <jnthn> It is only a prototype. ;-)

[16:09] <masak> we're a bit Unix-chauvinist all over the board, methinks.

[16:09] <jnthn> I do occasionally try and fight back against that a little.

[16:09] <masak> jnthn: at first I thought you were joking, because in the beginning the bootstrapping step of proto was actually written in sh. I had forgotten about create-new-project.

[16:17] * masak once used and enjoyed a TECO-based Emacs clone

[16:17] <TimToady> though what the difference is, I'm not sure

[16:17] <jaffa8> ok, IF oud it

[16:17] <TimToady> someone wrote a fortran compiler in it once

[16:18] <TimToady> you must have a lot of memory

[16:18] *** sbotond joined
[16:18] <TimToady> people used to type in their names to see what teco would do

[16:19] <araujo> something funny?

[16:19] <jaffa8> What could happen?

[16:19] <TimToady> depends on your name

[16:20] <araujo> yours for example? :)

[16:20] <TimToady> mine wasn't very interesting

[16:20] <araujo> haha

[16:21] <TimToady> I think it moved left one character and then appended rry or some such

[16:21] <TimToady> but I could be misremembering

[16:21] <TimToady> that was ancient history

[16:21] <jaffa8> Did you use teco?

[16:22] <TimToady> yes, it was much better than what it replaced

[16:22] <TimToady> but I haven't used it for real since before most of you were born

[16:22] <araujo> I have heard TECO was great, yeah, never used it .... 

[16:23] <TimToady> the original emacs was based on teco rather than lisp

[16:23] <araujo> yeah

[16:23] <araujo> it's what I read :P

[16:23] <TimToady> I never used that emacs, though

[16:23] <araujo> TimToady, actually the emacs name referred to the TECO macros or something like that?

[16:23] *** zloyrusskiy left
[16:24] <TimToady> dunno

[16:24] <TimToady> didn't come up that route

[16:24] <araujo> I remember reading something like that .....

[16:24] <masak> the emacs I used was very likely much newer. it came as the default Emacs of FreeDOS.

[16:24] <TimToady> I only ever used bare teco on a PDP-11 running RSTS/E

[16:25] <TimToady> back in the dark ages where if you really wanted to see what your program looked like, you had to print it out on the line printer

[16:26] *** payload joined
[16:26] <TimToady> well, except for the BASIC interpreter, which could list your program on the screen

[16:26] <TimToady> really high tech stuff

[16:27] *** PhatEddy joined
[16:27] <araujo> "The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab, and soon there accumulated a large collection of custom macros, whose names often ended in "MAC" or "MACS", which stood for "macro" ........ The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for "Editing MACroS". An alternative version is that EMACS stood for "E with MACroS"

[16:27] <araujo> from the wikipedia ....

[16:27] <masak> considering that, and given that the pace of development doesn't slack off. it's not that hard to believe in a singularity of some kind...

[16:28] <jaffa8> ACtually, it looks like Fortran is ealier than teco.

[16:28] <jaffa8> after reading wikipedia.

[16:28] <masak> jaffa8: FORTRAN is earlier than most things.

[16:31] <Su-Shee> TimToady: I recommend the "interview" with William Gibson "no map for these territories" on the subject of missing the future. 

[16:31] <PhatEddy> Is it worth a ticket or is it acceptable as well known now ...

[16:32] <masak> PhatEddy: feel free to ticket it.

[16:32] <araujo> TimToady, reveal the secret :P

[16:44] <jaffa8> ok

[16:45] <TimToady> nothing is wrong with it, assuming you're asking about syntax

[16:45] <TimToady> but most folks here think ',' is more readable

[16:45] <jaffa8> that was a typo

[16:45] <jaffa8> I got accustomed to perl5 regular expressions

[16:45] <TimToady> however, it would be wrong if you left out the space before the paren

[16:46] <TimToady> jaffa8: so did most of us

[16:46] <TimToady> the goal of perl 6 is not to continue with our accustomed ways

[16:47] <TimToady> nothing the matter with custom, except when it prevents progress

[16:48] <TimToady> and Perl 5 tends to value custom over progress, so we started Perl 6 to make the opposite mistake

[16:49] <masak> so far, so good.

[16:49] <jaffa8> I think if you made Perl5 on Parrot or Perl 5 to 6 interpreter that would serve both the past and the future.

[16:49] <masak> jaffa8: good idea. now, there's just the small matter of implementing...

[16:50] <jaffa8> by you, and did not mean you specifically, TimToady

[16:52] <jaffa8> at least on Perl5 on Parrot

[16:52] <jaffa8> Why did not stop?

[16:52] <jaffa8> Why did it stop?

[16:53] <masak> ISTR it was a year or so too early for such an effort.

[16:59] <TimToady> it will be popular with me, at least

[16:59] <lisppaste3> reqamst pasted "Infinite loop in CATCH block if using $/ in 'if' structure" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/85869

[17:00] <jaffa8> if that is all you want

[17:00] <TimToady> and I might be able to persuade a few other people to like it too

[17:00] <reqamst> I found bug, probably

[17:00] * araujo thinks perl6 might be popular between other kind of programmers 

[17:00] <masak> I think I might use Perl 6 a bit in the future.

[17:01] <masak> reqamst: I didn't report it though. strange.

[17:01] <duke_leto> Hm‚Ä¶ Why does rakudo warn about embedded comments needing a backtick? If it recognizes them, why not use ‚Äôem as comment?

[17:02] <TimToady> it's a deprecation

[17:02] <TimToady> and will probably break silently in another month or two

[17:02] <duke_leto> oh, okay :-)
