[00:05] <Juerd> Why does http://planetsix.perl.org/ not link to perl6.org in its sidebar?

[00:06] <Juerd> (Why is the official address not planet.perl6.org?)

[00:14] *** Guest23543 left
[00:14] <Tene> Juerd: the general situation, as far as I've seen it, is that nobody so far has *maintained* an active interest in infrastructure over long periods of time, especially when crossing administrative boundaries.

[00:15] <Tene> So it's probably not an explicit decision, but instead just where it was left byt he last person.

[00:17] <Tene> There's no overall design or plan for Perl 6's web presence, and no single point of contact, so it usually ends up being easier to just reimplement new.

[11:31] *** pnu joined
[11:32] <flip214> Well, is :l defined by using lstat or stat? if the latter, you shouldn't ever get ISLNK.

[11:34] <hejki> is there even lstat() in Parrot?

[11:52] <hejki> hiya masak 

[11:52] <hejki> i kinda need your confirmation here

[11:52] <masak> hei hejki!

[11:52] <hejki> the OS API document you pasted last night says stat number 3 is ISDEV, nevertheless in my tests it seems to behave exactly like ISLNK

[11:53] <hejki> (i.e. returns 0 for files and dirs, 1 for links)

[11:53] <masak> maybe the document is wrong.

[11:53] <hejki> wonder if the parrot api doc is a bit outdated

[11:53] <hejki> ye

[11:53] <masak> this is outside of my field of expretise, but it sounds like an excellent question for #parrot.

[11:53] <masak> the one on irc.perl.org.

[11:53] <hejki> irc.perl.org ?

[11:53] <hejki> i'm on the one on irc.parrot.org

[11:54] <masak> I don't know if that's the same one.

[11:54] <masak> but I see you on #parrot, so...

[11:54] <hejki> so most likely yes :>

[11:54] <masak> the server's "real name" is magnet.shadowcat.co.uk.

[11:55] <hejki> it doesn't seem to be the most active channel

[11:55] <masak> it can be, sometimes.

[11:55] <hejki> ye sure

[13:46] <masak> interesting. the advent calendar visitor statistics have been following a linear decline of about 100 readers per day since the 21st.

[13:47] <masak> if this keeps up, it'll have 0 readers three or four days from now.

[13:49] <colomon> Hmm.... does that imply that if we want to keep it going in the new year, we ought to get a bridge post up ASAP?

[13:50] <masak> nah. don't think so.

[14:22] <hejki> ye

[14:22] <hejki> i built it yday too

[14:23] <masak> oh dang. and since I successfully rebuilt and installed parrot, now my globally installed Rakudo doesn't work. :/

[14:26] <masak> the file where the errors occur, src/binder/bind.c, hasn't been touched since 2009-10-29 in master.

[14:27] <masak> it's reasonable to assume, at this point, that the build error stems from updating Parrot.

[14:40] <JimmyZ> but rakudo had stopped been developing for two months

[14:41] <masak> that's an uncharitable way to view it. :)

[14:42] <masak> but yes, work on ng has been less-than-painless.

[14:43] <JimmyZ> many peoples are waiting for rakudo star ;)

[14:43] <masak> maybe it was a case of the "let's do a number of refactors while we're in a branch" syndrome. maybe it was the fact that one or more of Rakudo's key developers were blocked/on vacation/distracted for long periods of time during Nov/Dec...

[14:43] <masak> maybe a combination of those.

[14:44] <masak> I still believe we can make it for the Rakudo Star deadline.

[14:44] <masak> but we're currently eating into our very good bonus time.

[14:44] <hejki> masak: i updated it today

[14:44] <hejki> masak: (+ applied my patches)

[14:45] <masak> hejki: ah. I still don't grok -why- a Parrot update would ruin the Rakudo build, but that seems to be the most likely explanation.

[14:45] <masak> nod.

[16:02] <masak> over at #parrot, we've located the Rakudo build problem to some extent.

[16:03] <masak> it is introduced somewhere between Parrot's r43076 (PARROT_REVISION) and r43275.

[16:08] <colomon> It was a change in Parrot that did it?

[16:08] <colomon> s/did it/caused the problem/

[16:09] <masak> yes, but I don't see how.

[16:09] <masak> I mean, what change in Parrot would make bind.c not compile anym...

[16:09] <masak> ...oh.

[16:10] <masak> perhaps there were some changes in how Parrot does binding.

[16:10] <masak> I mean, bind.c does most things on its own nowadays, but perhaps not all of it.

[16:10] <masak> or things may have just changed names a little in Parrot.

[16:12] <masak> anyway, I don't have the -fu to debug it. and it's not a critical issue -- I'll just have to remember not to update my Parrot for a while.

[16:21] *** xinming_ joined
[16:22] <ash_> so whats wrong with rakudo right now? it won't build with trunk parrot? 

[16:24] <masak> ash_: hejki and I had problems for a while because we were using a too recent Parrot.

[16:52] <p6eval> rakudo 77bf8c: 1a1b1c1d2a2b2c2d3a3b3c3d4a4b4c4d␤

[16:57] <hejki> if i'm gonna try implementing {open,close,read}dir, i guess src/builtins/io.pir is the right place?

[17:00] <ash_> hejki: are you working in Master or ng? 

[17:02] <hejki> Master

[17:04] <ash_> seems right then

[17:05] *** [synth] left
[17:06] <ash_> there or maybe in the src/setting/IO.pm 

[17:10] <ash_> hejki: if you got them working in ng that would be really useful too, its source is organized differently and takes a little bit different approach than the Master branch, its supposed to replace master in the near future too, its kind of a refactor of rakudo 

[17:11] <hejki> ok

[19:31] <pugs_svn> r29402 | pmurias++ | update to newest JavaScript::XS 

[19:31] <pugs_svn> r29403 | pmurias++ | make sure unicode is yamlified correctly 

[19:32] <pugs_svn> r29404 | pmurias++ | [mildew] no longer work around the way STD handled self on my box 

[19:32] <pmurias> mberends: i fixed the bug that stopped you from building mildew

[19:33] <pmurias> mberends: i turned out gimme5 messed up unicode and the bug was only visible on my box and mildew evolved to depend on it

[19:34] <mberends> pmurias: good detective work!

[19:35] <mberends> I'll update immediately :-)

[19:36] <ash_> how's vill coming along?

[19:37] <mberends> ash_: slow progress. The yaml loader was unverified, but the roundtrip tester is growing steadily. That needs to be complete before climbing in to the code generator.

[19:46] <ash_> out of curiosity, why do you need a yaml parser at this phase? 

[19:46] <mberends> pmurias: I tried every library possible from http://yaml.org and each one somehow did not deliver the required results

[19:47] *** swap joined

[19:48] <mberends> ash_: a very good question. the 'viv' parser outputs AST in YAML format. Sprixel has a neat trick to use another format, but I did not understand it well enough at the time.

[19:49] <ash_> ah, i didn't know viv returned the ast as YAML, interesting 

[19:49] <mberends> pmurias: ISTR that libyaml did not process the anchors and aliases that viv emits correctly

[19:50] <cognominal> viv?

[19:50] <mberends> viv is a parser for STD.pm grammar, running in Perl 5

[19:51] <cognominal> thx

[19:51] <pmurias> viv is a frontend for the STD.pm grammar

[19:52] <mberends> see http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/

[19:52] <ash_> so, is viv using like yaml 1.2? or are the libraries not compliant with the spec?

[19:52] <jjore> omewhere

[19:54] <mberends> ash_: viv uses both YAML::XS and YAML::Syck, because, er, I dunno, but I tried to refactor that recently and got a bloody nose

[19:55] <pmurias> mberends: does mildew build now?

[19:56] <mberends> running make..

[19:56] <ash_> good luck mberends 

[19:57] <ash_> i don't know much about the yaml spec, only done really basic things with it

[20:17] <mberends> mildew 'make test' issues lots of noise, but also ........ok quite regularly :-)

[20:17] * colomon has just found he no longer remembers the all the various Perl 6 interpreter / compiler projects underway.  (If he ever actually knew them...)

[20:20] <pmurias> mberends: noise?

[20:21] <mberends> pmurias: not audible noise literally, but warning and error messages

[20:21] <mberends> I'll do a nopaste at the end

[20:21] <rjbs> Do we have a factoid bot in here?

[20:22] <rjbs> One I could ask about, say, mildew? :)

[20:22] <colomon> pointme: mildew

[20:22] <colomon> point: mildew

[20:22] <masak> ENOPOINTME

[20:22] <mdxi> i googled 'perl6 mildew' and got somethinig which seems accurate enough

[20:22] <pmurias> mberends: two failures are to be expected

[20:22] <colomon> masak: pointme was right, right?

[20:23] <masak> yes.

[20:23] <mberends> moritz_++ knows everything, but his bot fingers are operated by a human ;)

[20:23] <masak> :)

[20:31] <mberends> mildew test summary: Files=57, Tests=195, 836 wallclock secs ( 0.56 usr  0.17 sys + 781.27 cusr 23.98 csys = 805.98 CPU)

[20:31] <pugs_svn> r29405 | pmurias++ | [mildew] unbreak SDL using example 

[20:32] <ruoso> pmurias, I was thinking... the integration with p5 doesn't need to take the smop code inside it

[20:32] <ruoso> that's just making it harder

[20:32] <ruoso> and provides few benefits

[20:33] <ruoso> it's probably better to simply link to smop externally

[20:33] <pmurias> not entangling with the perl5 build process is definitly a good idea

[20:34] <ruoso> everytime I start looking at the p5 build process I give up ;)

[20:34] <pmurias> i guess you are not the only one

[20:36] <pmurias> mberends: you need Coro and to upgrade MooseX::Declare (or so other Moose thing)

[20:36] <mberends> pmurias: thanks, will do and will repeat the tests
