[09:45] <Matt-W> masak: is it a good idea to mention eigenvalues in the glossary entry on autothreading?

[09:45] <Matt-W> At least, without explaining what eigenvalues are

[09:45] <masak> Matt-W: there should probably be an explanation somewhere, possibly right there.

[09:46] <masak> and a separate entry for eigenvalues.

[09:46] <moritz_> eigenstates please

[09:46] <masak> to be honest, I haven't more than skimmed moritz_++' contributions yet. :/

[09:47] <moritz_> oh, and I added Junction.eigenstates to S29

[09:47] <masak> excellent. moritz_++

[09:47] <Matt-W> Ah did moritz_ write that bit

[09:47] <moritz_> and there's S03-junctions/eigenstates.t, and the eigenstate-expose branch on githup

[09:48] <moritz_> *github

[09:49] <masak> Matt-W: moritz_ is the only one who's written any actual documentation in u4x so far.

[09:49] <masak> my attention has been elsewhere the past few weeks.

[09:49] <moritz_> and pmichaud already improved it

[09:50] <Matt-W> I've been thinking about doing it, but not sure how to start (and having trouble finding the time), so I'm just making pathetic excuses instead :)

[09:51] <masak> since I plan to expand that project in phases, I'd be most appreciative if people wrote one entry of each "type".

[09:51] <masak> i.e. one for a class, one for a method, and so on

[09:51] *** mikehh left
[09:52] <masak> perhaps also noting somewhere their thoughts about the linking and meta information required for psi to work.

[09:53] *** pmurias joined
[09:56] <Matt-W> mmm

[09:56] *** kane__ left
[09:56] <Matt-W> so you envisage an entry for a class, and then a separate entry for each of that class' methods?

[09:56] <Matt-W> with enough metadata that they can be linked together easily

[09:59] <moritz_> http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/tidings-2009-02.html btw

[09:59] <Matt-W> moritz_: saw it, nicely done

[10:00] <moritz_> thanks

[10:00] <Matt-W> meeting &

[10:00] <moritz_> I've also added a link the periodic table now

[10:01] <masak> Matt-W: I'm not sure where things'll end up. there's something to be said for putting the methods in the same file as the class/role where they're defined. that's a kind of linking, too. :)

[10:02] *** mj41 left
[10:02] <masak> the point is that I don't know how the structure should look, and I think that prototyping a few entries might bring out some sane first-generation ideas about it.

[10:04] <masak> moritz_: I like how S29 is almost catching up to reality, not to mention the other synopses. I hope I'll have the time to tick some more entries in the laundry list.

[10:06] <masak> bacek_: aye, after backlogging I see the bug. reporting.

[10:19] <masak> I should really check out the synopses and u4x with git-svn too. in fact, I'll do that now. it'll make me more productive when I'm offline.

[10:21] *** cognominal joined
[10:22] <moritz_> uhm, the pugs repo doesn't have the standard layout (trunk/, branches/, tags/) - how do I use 'git-svn init' then?

[10:23] <moritz_> or more to the point, it doesn't have a branches dir at all

[10:23] <masak> moritz_: I don't think that layout is a requirement.

[10:23] <masak> I just checked out u4x, and it worked.

[10:23] <masak> git svn clone http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/u4x

[10:23] <masak> no 'init' required.

[10:23] <moritz_> ah

[10:24] <moritz_> I did git-svn init http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/t/

[10:24] <moritz_> git-svn clone

[10:24] <moritz_> that wasn't good

[10:24] <moritz_> but a 'git-svn fetch' instead is all good'

[10:24] <masak> moritz_: aye, I'd guess that 'init' and 'clone' shouldn't be used in the same workflow.

[10:29] <masak> I've come to appreciate that somewhat lengthy process. it's git-svn turning an svn repo into something beautiful. :P

[10:41] <masak> anyone ever tried to make Parrot and Rakudo on feather, only to be greeted by this message when making Rakudo?

[10:41] <masak> Can't create /home/duff/parrot/tools/build/../../src/pmc/default.dump: Permission denied at /home/duff/parrot/tools/build/../../lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/PMC.pm line 68

[10:42] <masak> I would like to add that my account name on feather is not 'duff'.

[10:43] <moritz_> masak: parrot uses hardcoded paths to where it was build, which is why it screws up p6eval so bad

[10:43] <moritz_> masak: maybe it followed some symlink, or so?

[10:43] <masak> I don't see how. I downloaded both Parrot and Rakudo from their respective repos.

[10:44] <masak> oh, an ack search does turn up something interesting!

[10:45] <masak> the BUILD_DIR in Rakudo's Makefile is set to /home/duff/parrot

[10:46] <masak> must be something Configure.pl is doing, then.

[10:53] <Matt-W> So the problem with having a company with quite a few intelligent and passionate software developers is that when you put them all in a room and get them to discuss policy, they end up being passionate about that too... from different directions

[10:54] <masak> aye, that follows logically.

[10:57] <Matt-W> It's very hard not to jump on the table and scream at them that all our problems would be much alleviated if we could do our source control with git

[11:13] <pugs_svn> r25356 | ruoso++ | [spec/S16] async should not be an argument to a method, but it is an attribute of the IO object.

[11:13] <pugs_svn> r25356 | ruoso++ | (there need to be more work in S16 to sanitize all the roles. Some references to IO::POSIX are reversed. It is IO::POSIX that should do some generic roles (like IO::Streamable) not the other way around.)

[11:13] <chid> ok..

[11:13] <masak> my guess is that if there were an easy fix, it'd be fixed already.

[11:13] <chid> I mean from my end

[11:13] <moritz_> not rename the directory

[11:13] <chid> perhaps a config file

[11:13] <chid> I didn't

[11:13] <chid> the installer isbroken :p

[11:14] <chid> as written: This might be highly related to the need to create an installable parrot/rakudo.

[11:14] <moritz_> aye

[11:14] <moritz_> maybe the #parrot folks should bothered

[11:14] <chid> lol

[11:15] <chid> where are parrot config files on win32

[11:19] <chid> ok, fine

I lost about 4 hours work on proto, but it will take less time to re-do. It may take a little time to get this xandros distro equipped with the toolchain, not sure yet. 'apt-get install git-core' says Couldn't find package git-core. Hmm.

[13:43] <masak> mberends: sorry about your laptop. looking forward to seeing the fruits of your work. hope my commit didn't interfere too much.

[13:44] <masak> I'm still not sure the addition of the 'showdeps' subcommand is worth the trouble. maybe it would be if there was a way to observe the contents of the deps.proto file without downloading the whole repo. but sadly, I don't know enough about github's API to know if that's possible.

[13:45] <mberends> lambdabot is not giving me a message. we can wget deps.proto from github via http.

[13:47] * ruoso notices that no-one commented about the $.output_record_separator in IO::Encoded (besides one argument that it should be in IO::Writeable::Encoded)...

[13:47] <masak> mberends: cool.

[13:47] <ruoso> I wonder if that mean that they are ok, even if some piece of the spec suggested that wouldn't be supported

[13:47] <masak> mberends: but then we'll need to split up the installcmd key into several keys.

[13:53] <masak> "landlord"?

[13:53] *** WootKit left
[13:53] <gfldex> quite a good game tho

[13:54] <masak> it's still too general.

[13:54] * mberends is not thrilled yet

[13:54] <masak> the word should convey "the storage/hosting solution that this particular project elected for itself"

[13:55] <mberends> site?

[13:55] <masak> a bit too general, but yes.

[13:55] <masak> I've written 'hub', but it's too github-specific.

[13:55] <gfldex> homeland?

[13:55] <masak> gfldex: nice.

[13:55] <masak> but this has nothing to do with countries.

[13:55] <masak> "home"?

[13:56] <masak> quite a coze one.

[13:56] <masak> s/coze/cozy/

[13:56] <mberends> metarepository? a bit long

[13:56] <gfldex> nest? but i think that's taken by parrot

[13:56] <masak> mberends: and a bit too clinical for me.

[13:56] <masak> gfldex: you're getting the idea, at least. :)

[13:57] <masak> "haven"?

[13:57] <gfldex> not sure if english got the word you are looking for

[13:57] <gfldex> you are looking for the german word Heimat

[13:57] * mberends is beginning to like "home"

[13:58] <masak> gfldex: you'd be surprized :)

[13:58] <masak> mberends: then "home" it is, at least for now.

[13:58] <mberends> yes, it's good

[13:58] <masak> so I have 'home', 'owner', and 'name', with the last one defaulting to the name of the (proto) project.

[14:16] <moritz_> ruoso: please move it instead of throwing it out

[14:16] <moritz_> if in doubt use S29

[14:16] <ruoso> ok

[14:16] <mberends> masak: cannot pull, but thanks. rebooting...

[14:16] <masak> mberends: another thing I'm thinking of fixing before it's too late, is putting all the donwloaded projects (including parrot) into a single gitignored directory inside proto. the soiled git status is starting to annoy me.

[14:16] <masak> bah, fixing that now.

[14:17] *** xinming left
[14:17] <ruoso> moritz_, return isn't referenced in S29 also

[14:17] <ruoso> maybe the explanation in S04 suffices for now...

[14:18] <mberends> masak: good idea. but better would be to install thee other projects as siblings of proto instead of children, ie one level up. I was planning to suggest that.

[14:18] <moritz_> ruoso: isn't warn() more similar to die() or fail() than to return()?

[14:18] <ruoso> moritz_, no

[14:18] <ruoso> warn raises a control exception

[14:18] <masak> mberends: dare we do that? it feels on the verge of being intrusive...

[14:18] <ruoso> die and fail raises a failure

[14:19] <mberends> yeah, go on!

[14:19] <moritz_> ruoso: I was more thinking of a user point-of-view

[14:19] <ruoso> maybe...

[14:19] <mberends> it's actually more respectful of the other packages

[14:19] <masak> mberends: it makes sense in my particular file hierarchy, at least for the git projects.

[14:20] <ruoso> moritz_, It's just that I'm working on S16 and warn was in the way... I'm not really thinking about it now...

[14:20] <masak> but not for the non-git projects, and not for parrot.

[14:20] <mberends> and when proto+1 comes along proto can retire without incident

[14:20] <masak> mberends: I keep my git projects in a separate dir, see.

[14:20] <mberends> it's a tough call, evidently

[14:20] <masak> no, your suggestion is very tempting, but I think I'll veto it for now.

[14:21] <masak> better to be able to set such a think in a settings file somewhere.
