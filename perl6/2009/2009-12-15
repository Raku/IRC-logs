[02:43] <sjohnson> diakopter: since no perl chat is going on just yet... i was wondering if you know anything about if it's illegal to take things from a landfill

[02:44] <sjohnson> like, car batteries citizens think are dead, but just need a recharge and could be sold 2nd hand

[02:46] <diakopter> depends who owns the landfill, I guess

[02:52] <colomon> perhaps I'm too cynical, but taking reusable things from a landfill sounds like one of those things that's such an obvious good that it almost certainly is against the law or something.

[03:01] <wayland76> It is against the law here in Australia

[03:01] <wayland76> (I think it's health measures = insurance that causes the problem)

[03:03] <wayland76> There are guys, though, who ask people for things off their trailers before they're put into landfill

[03:03] <PerlJam> okay.  Just checking.   I'm reading through the logs of #parrotsketch from Sunday.  I just got to the point where they're talking about focusing on a successful Rakudo* release

[03:04] *** lestrrat joined
[03:05] <diakopter> I guess sending too many messages to it

[03:05] <spinclad> Wolfman2000: doing a large cut-and-paste into the room, where your irc client doesn't do its own rate-limiting (say to 1 line/sec)

[03:05] *** allbery_b joined
[03:05] <diakopter> (but if you weren't sending anything, freenode glitches)

[03:07] <JimmyZ> irclog?

[03:07] <spinclad> Wolfman2000: dunno then

[03:07] <spinclad> vantage number one of holding such a meeting online: everyone can read the WHOLE THING.

[03:08] * diakopter sets aside more than 20 minutes to read the #parrotsketch irclog

[03:09] *** synth left
[03:09] * diakopter scrolls more quickly

[03:10] <PerlJam> I wrote a short article for www.perl.com 4 or so years ago about Perl 6.  Back then it felt very much like Perl 6 was 2-3 years away from an alpha release.  Today Perl 6 *still* feels like it's about 2-3 years away, but from a "beta" release  (I wish I had a good way to calibrate my Perl6-sense)

[03:10] <diakopter> lol.  kid51: Ah! a customer has just walked thru the door!

[03:10] *** nihiliad joined
[03:11] <diakopter> I dunno, 3 years ago I felt like Perl 6 already had beta releases.

[03:11] <colomon> PerlJam: really?  it feels to me like a proper rakudo beta will be ready approx in late 2010.

[03:11] <spinclad> PerlJam: that's progress (and there's been plenty)

[03:12] <PerlJam> I wonder if several someones could estimate the number of person-months needed to finish Perl 6, then perhaps we could tap into the wisdom of crowds for a good answer.

[03:12] <spinclad> colomon: it might depend on whether a good beta has to run nonglacially

[03:12] <diakopter> PerlJam: I assume you found http://nopaste.snit.ch/19067

[03:12] <PerlJam> colomon: What do you see "Rakudo Beta" having that "Rakudo *" does not?

[03:12] <spinclad> PerlJam: 'finish'?

[03:12] <colomon> I really think the speed thing will work itself over the next year.

[03:13] <PerlJam> spinclad: you know what I mean.  (or should)

[03:13] <colomon> PerlJam: BigInts and FatRats.  fully working (if not threaded) hyper operators.  things like that.

[03:13] <PerlJam> "finish to the degree that ordinary programming folk would call the language "done" or "ready" "

[03:13] <spinclad> 'good enough to call done'

[03:13] <diakopter> PerlJam: 'finish'?  to the Synopses as they are today?  a few 2<<10 person-months

[03:14] <colomon> Also, I'm starting to doubt that even the worst of the speed issues will be finished by R*, so those too.

[03:14] <diakopter> PerlJam: I assume you found http://nopaste.snit.ch/19067

[03:24] <diakopter> parrot 2.3 scheduled for release in April 2010

[03:24] <diakopter> mid-April, it seems

[03:27] <diakopter> so it seems the goals for that release (including the 2.0 goals) are:

[03:28] *** solarion left
[03:30] <diakopter> 1) solve TT389 - fix :anon, :method   (from Allison's last two comments, looks like a few tens of person-hours - my blind guess, including project overhead)

[03:30] *** cotto_working left
[03:32] *** rbaumer joined
[03:32] <diakopter> 2) solve TT566 - looks like pmichaud already (today) did this

[03:33] <diakopter> 3) same for TT568

[03:33] <diakopter> & 567 I mean

[03:34] <diakopter> 2) TT592 - write documentation for parrot debugger. I suspect I speak for most when I conjecture that that will slip in light of the other priorities

[03:36] <diakopter> 3) fix/extend the garbage collector - TT607/616 - a few thousand person-hours?  I don't know.

[03:37] *** [synth] joined
[03:38] <diakopter> 4) subroutine (and transitive ones) exit handlers.  a few hundred person-hours, order of magnitude guess.

[03:38] *** meppl joined
[03:38] *** avuserow left
[03:39] <diakopter> looks like native-type-lexicals got pushed to Oct 2010

[03:39] <spinclad> :(

[03:39] <diakopter> along with async I/O and constant data structures

[03:40] <diakopter> while concurrency was sent to Jan 2011

[09:23] <moritz_> can we somehow teach the overview posting not to send pingbacks to the other blog posts?

[09:23] <moritz_> (on the advent calendar, that is)

[09:23] <moritz_> they look rather spammy, which is why I deleted most of them manually

[09:24] <frettled> omgitsmasak

[09:24] <masak> moritz_: good thinking. blog posts not sending pingbacks to other posts on the same blog sounds like a FAQ. question is what to google for.

[09:51] <masak> "If Perl 6 didn't exist, someone would have invented it by now."

[09:51] <masak> this is my thought when backlogging over yesterday's discussion about P5 specializing in keeping backwards compatibility, and P6 specializing in breaking it.

[09:53] <masak> the people with the "research project" meme are right insofar as P6 being a great enabler of the idea of "what happens if we break the stuff that needs breaking?"

[09:53] <masak> "Perl 6: Perl without the brakes." :P

[09:57] <vamped> too many things in society exists solely to not break backwards compatibility. Way to go Perl 6!

[09:59] <frettled> heh

[10:00] <frettled> masak: I had similar thoughts a few days ago: I wondered where Perl 5 would be if not for Perl 6.

[10:01] <masak> frettled: it might be doing pretty well, it's hard to say. I think Moose would be affected quite a bit in some way.

[10:02] <masak> someone might want to make an alternative history blog post. :)

[10:02] <frettled> From my perspective, it looks like Perl 5 got vitalized by the Perl 6 development.

[10:02] <masak> I think so too.

[10:02] <moritz_> if there was no Perl 6, Larry would have tried to mold Perl 5 into something less "broken"

[10:02] <frettled> moritz_: and we'd call it Perl 6!

[10:03] <vamped> if Perl 5.10 is enough, then why bother with 5.11 and 5.12 and ... ? I think that in a few years time, once Perl 6 is up, stable, with good modules, many will convert.

[10:03] *** r0bby joined
[10:03] <moritz_> vamped: because Perl 6 is not Perl 5, and will never be

[10:03] <frettled> vamped: It's not _that_ long ago that I looked at the list of improvements from 5.6 to 5.8 and though «okay, so Unicode support is better, but …»

[10:03] <moritz_> and there are not only people who like Perl, but also people who like Perl 5

[10:05] *** Baggio_ joined
[10:06] <frettled> and there are weird guys like me, who like both Perl 5 and Perl 6

[10:07] *** c9s_ joined
[10:07] <vamped> @moritz: yes. what i'm saying though is that many people who love Perl 5 will love Perl 6 too.

[10:07] *** payload left
[10:08] <moritz_> vamped: I know. But there also many people who won't love Perl 6

[10:08] <moritz_> and remember, this is open source and volunteer driven. There's just no way to say "we discontinue $a in favor of $b" when people want to work on $a.

[10:08] * masak .oO( good thing we booted lambdabot )

[10:09] *** c9s left
[10:09] <vamped> agrees with @moritz completely, while struggling to find the logic.

[10:09] <moritz_> vamped: we're not on twitter, no need to prefix nicknames with an @

[10:09] <moritz_> that looks like I'm an array :-)

[10:10] <vamped> maybe you have multiple personalities? lol. ok.

[10:10] <masak> moritz_-clones!

[10:10] <masak> we'll order 10, and get the test suite finished early!

[10:10] <moritz_> vamped: maybe I have, but on IRC I try to hide them beneath a unified interface :-)

[10:14] <flip214> is there no accessor for them? not even private?

[10:15] <moritz_> private, yes

[10:15] *** c9s_ is now known as c9s

[10:19] <masak> I'm always fascinated by different types of "X hijacking", mostly because the exploits are clever-ish. http://haacked.com/archive/2009/06/25/json-hijacking.aspx

[10:20] <masak> do you think that people will send things serialized with .perl in Perl 6, and suffer for it?

[10:21] <moritz_> I hope they won't, because it requires eval() in the receiver side

[10:21] <moritz_> which is very dangerous anyway

[10:22] <masak> AFAIU, that's the way it's traditionally been done with JSON.

[10:22] <masak> (and yes, it's bad)

[10:22] <masak> a JSON parser for JavaScript wasn't written until quite recently.

[10:25] <moritz_> I think firefox has a sandbox-eval that allows only side-effect free evaluation, or some such

[10:26] <masak> which amounts to using the JavaScript parser as a JSON parser, and smacking it over the fingers if it tries something else.

[10:26] <moritz_> right

[10:26] *** Guest11428 left
[10:26] <moritz_> I wonder if we can have a :pure option to eval() in Perl 6

[10:27] <masak> sounds like a fun job for a module. :)

[10:27] <moritz_> sounds like poking deep into the compiler, to me

[10:27] <masak> yeah, probably.

[10:30] <moritz_> and while glancing over the page you linked to, I think the real problem in there is that something eval()s the js. The rest is "just" a clever environment manipulation to use that for mischief

[10:33] *** JimmyZ left
[10:34] *** vamped left
[10:34] <masak> moritz_: indeed.

[10:35] *** agentzh left
[10:35] <masak> moritz_: November the Wiki uses files, .perl and eval in lieu of a database. not because we think it's a good solution, but because it was the simplest thing that could possibly work.

[10:36] <masak> moritz_: so there's already a precedent in Perl 6 culture of someone doing it wrong. :)

[10:40] *** jferrero joined
[10:46] <spinclad> it would be a bit safer to eval the .perl in a constrained language, that can only build :pure constructs

[10:47] <masak> i.e. a standalone parser.

[10:47] <spinclad> yup

[10:47] <masak> P6ON :)

[10:50] <spinclad> a standalone grammar-plus-actions, anyway

[10:51] <spinclad> (the grammar engine being the ocean this fish swims in)

[10:55] <masak> hm, so subroutines default to :(@_), but &map defaults to :($_ is rw), correct?

[10:55] <masak> why is the former readonly but not the latter?

[10:55] <masak> hm, it's not &map, is it? it's anon blocks in general.

[10:57] *** tarskic left
[10:58] <masak> I guess one motivation for making anon blocks readonly goes like this: map and for are equivalent, and we still would like to be able to do things like `$_ += 2 for @stuff;`

[10:58] *** payload joined
[11:01] *** hanekomu_ joined
[11:03] <spinclad> otoh you can say `@stuff .= map: *+2`; that would seem to ease the call for mutating mappers somewhat

[11:07] <masak> troo.

[11:07] <spinclad> although that replaces @stuff rather than replacing each element (which might matter); other than that i think it's equally expressive.

[11:08] <spinclad> it just substitues an effective '@stuff is rw' for '$stuffing is rw'

[11:11] <masak> heh. :)

[11:11] <moritz_> masak: if the things you store in November are simple enough, you could use JSON - at the cost of a speed hit, of course

[11:11] <masak> moritz_: mm. my mental November ROADMAP wants to try Squerl.

[11:12] <spinclad> but discards any aliasing on the @stuff[*]'s

[11:13] <moritz_> masak: Whatever :-)

[11:14] <spinclad> .oO( ROADMAP discards aliasing )  # nonono

[11:16] * spinclad thinks november is ripe for squerl

[11:17] <masak> and, possibly, the other way around. :)

[11:17] <masak> sushi &

[11:18] <moritz_> masak: blocks default to -> Object $_ is ref = OUTER::<$_> or so, subroutines to *@_

[11:22] <Juerd> That's unfair to Perl 5

[11:23] <Juerd> my @dice = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = print $dice[rand @dice] . "\n";

[11:23] <Juerd> s/= print/; print/

[11:23] <Juerd> For the single pick,  $dice[rand @dice] isn't that much worse than @dice.pick

[11:24] <moritz_> right

[11:24] <Juerd> The real big benefit comes when you pick multiple things, because in Perl 5 that generally is a lot of administration if you want to avoid picking the same thing twice.

[11:26] <BinGOs> print +(1..6)[rand 6], "\n";

[13:24] <IllvilJa> Having the option of supplying a 'weight' function to the .pick() method to dynamically manipulate the probability of each element to be .picked() would be very useful.  Dynamically letting individual elements get a probability of zero to exempt them from being picked would be useful too. Calls for me writing a module I guess ;-).

[13:24] *** JimmyZ left
[13:24] * IllvilJa curses the fact there is so much to do and so little time...

[13:24] *** beggars left
[13:24] <moritz_> well, time doesn't just exist, you have to take the time to do things

[13:24] *** omega left
[13:26] <IllvilJa> I have to implode into a black hole, and create a little big bang and associated universe with eternal amount of time which I use to write up all kinds of fun code and then return back with the goodies... Should work.  Only a few technical details to sort out.

[13:27] <IllvilJa> Like becoming a person again after being a black hole for 0 seconds/1 infinity.... or avoiding that the rest of the world get's sucked in in the process (which really would be in the way for my code writing...)

[13:27] <moritz_> and in the time you wait for the money to be allocated, you can write a few Perl 6 modules. Sounds like a great plan :-)

[13:27] <moritz_> (the money you need for buying the equiment to build a black hole, of course)

[13:28] <coke> moritz_: I saw that episode of SG:1. apparently you can just get it over the internet.

[13:28] <masak> IllvilJa: the 'weight' feature you're requesting is already spec'd.

[13:28] <masak> IllvilJa: but it's spec'd on Bags, and Rakudo doesn't have those yet.

[13:28] <colomon> Was just writing that in a comment reply.  ;)

[13:53] <Wolfman2000> *yawn* morning

[13:53] <masak> o/

[13:54] <Wolfman2000> Guess my last topic choice was a good one.

[13:54] <colomon> getting a lot of interest, for sure.

[13:54] <carlin> Wolfman2000: I told you you picked a good topic ;-)

[13:55] <Wolfman2000> ...of course, now I realized I should have made a Bingo example, but then I remembered that I don't recall the best way to turn 5 lists verticle.

[13:55] <Wolfman2000> vertical*

[13:55] <Wolfman2000> I'll let someone else deal with that.

[13:55] <colomon> ha!  bingo never occurred to me as an example, but it's keen.

[13:56] <slavik> if for and map are equivalent, is there a reason to have both?

[13:56] <moritz_> yes

[13:56] <slavik> bah, chat window didn't scroll down, but question stands :)

[13:56] <colomon> anyone have recommendations for a linux rescue CD?  my house's mian server appears to be hosed...

[13:56] *** Guest72971 left
[13:56] <colomon> *main

[13:56] <slavik> moritz_: for what purpose?

[13:56] <moritz_> colomon: grml

[13:56] <slavik> colomon: ubuntu/knoppix

[13:56] <Wolfman2000> colomon: not familiar with rescue CDs

[13:57] <Wolfman2000> but ubuntu for getting teh data is a good idea

[13:57] <moritz_> slavik: timtowtdi. They read rather differently

[13:57] * Wolfman2000 would have done so for his dad's old laptop, but the motherboard just gives up after 3 minutes.

[13:57] <masak> they're of different grammatical category.

[13:57] <masak> map is a listop, for is a special statement form.

[13:58] <moritz_> http://grml.org/download/ FWIW

[13:58] <slavik> I see, but other than that, there is no real difference?

[13:58] <colomon> moritz_: thanks, trying to figure out which version to download...

[13:59] <moritz_> slavik: there is, if you have a list-thing which overrides map

[13:59] <slavik> I see

[14:00] <slavik> for grammars, is it possible to have a grammar act as a parser and output error messages if it doesn't properly match?

[14:00] <moritz_> colomon: grml-medium should be enough for most recovery tasks (200MB download)

[14:00] <slavik> since you can define tokens, it could say what token it was expecting and what it got

[14:00] <moritz_> slavik: yes

[14:00] <slavik> sweet

[14:00] <moritz_> slavik: you can also give the tokens different names in the error message

[14:00] <moritz_> with the :dba ("do business as") adverb

[14:01] <slavik> moritz_: is there a working example of this?

[14:01] <moritz_> rakudo: token foo { :dba<bar> '{' ~ '}' [\s+] }; '{   ' ~~ /<foo>/

[14:01] <colomon> moritz_: downloading now.  danke.

[14:01] <moritz_> slavik: STD.pm is full of it :-)

[14:01] <p6eval> rakudo 7ef386: Unable to find regex 'bar'␤in regex 

[14:01] <rodi> STD.pm has some nice error messages.

[14:02] <rodi> yeah, what moritz_ said.

[14:02] <moritz_> rakudo: token foo { :dba('bar') '{' ~ '}' [\s+] }; '{   ' ~~ /<foo>/

[14:02] <p6eval> rakudo 7ef386: Unable to parse 'bar', couldn't find final '}'␤in regex 

[14:02] <moritz_> wtf?

[14:04] <moritz_> in master, src/parser/grammar.pg contains a :dba('...')

[14:04] <moritz_> so I think it should work

[14:04] <moritz_> ah

[14:04] <moritz_> it actually worked

[14:04] <moritz_> but I was confused that it gave an error message :-)

[14:05] <moritz_> rakudo: token foo { :dba('block with curlies') '{' ~ '}' [\s+] }; '{   ' ~~ /<foo>/

[14:05] <p6eval> rakudo 7ef386: Unable to parse 'block with curlies', couldn't find final '}'␤in regex 

[14:05] <rodi> wow, that's nifty.

[14:06] <masak> rakudo: token foo { :dba(block with curlies) '{' ~ '}' [\s+] }; '{   ' ~~ /<foo>/

[14:06] <p6eval> rakudo 7ef386: Unable to parse block with curlies, couldn't find final '}'␤in regex 

[14:06] <rodi> why does that work?

[14:07] <slavik> nice

[14:07] <moritz_> that's a bit scary

[14:07] <moritz_> it shouldn't :-)

[14:07] *** SmokeMachine left
[14:07] <frettled> Re: weighted pick() - I have this nagging feeling that it might be easyish to find a work-around for that.

[14:07] <rodi> I grok :dba<block with curlies> but not what masak wrote...

[14:07] <PerlJam> morning

[14:07] <moritz_> rodi: it's a rakudo limitation, not spec

[14:07] <slavik> what about token program { <statement>+ }; token statement { blah blah }, you get the idea

[14:08] *** Exodist left
[14:08] <PerlJam> looking over the last several days of perl6 tweets, it seems that there are many more positive tweets about it.  

[14:08] <frettled> IllvilJa: The problem with weighting pick() (or some other method), is how to fribble the notation properly.

[14:08] <slavik> and out of multiple possibilities for a statement to tell you what it is expecting

[14:08] <moritz_> slavik: you mean like STD.pm does it?

[14:08] <slavik> moritz_: don't know haven't seen it :)

[14:09] <rodi> moritz_: gotcha, okay.

[14:09] <slavik> moritz_: idea is to have a parser for code where you only define grammar and then just walk the tree :P

[14:09] <slavik> to be able to write an interpreter in perl6 by defining the grammar and then walking the smart matcher object

[14:10] <masak> PerlJam: definitely a positive trend since the P6AC, yes.

[14:10] <jnthn> o/

[14:11] <moritz_> slavik: it's probably easier to define action/reduction methods to build some kind of AST as an intermediate format

[14:11] <slavik> hmm

[14:11] <moritz_> otherwise each and every grammar change means changes to the interpreter kernel

[14:11] <moritz_> and that's really painful

[14:34] <masak> by some astounding coincidence, STD.pm currently weighs in at 5600 lines of code. but I wouldn't call it ad-hoc. :)

[14:35] <colomon> the good news: grml does indeed have memtest86, even in grml-medium.

[14:35] <Wolfman2000> is there something magic about 5600?

[14:35] *** Trey_ is now known as Trey

[14:35] <colomon> the bad news: just selecting memtest86 to run kills the system before memtest can actually start.  :(

[14:39] <moritz_> colomon: so it's CPU, motherboard or RAM. :/

[14:41] <moritz_> I have no idea where this 5600 comes from, and how fair or unfair it is to compare parsing code with BNF grammars

[15:10] <frettled> masak/moritz_: or «medium with a refraction index closer to 1» :D

[15:11] <masak> meh.

[15:11] <frettled> The terminology seems to be «less optically dense» and «more optically dense»

[15:11] <frettled> or «lower optical density» and «higher optical density»

[15:12] <frettled> lower or higher refraction index/index of refraction

[15:12] <masak> hokay.

[15:12] <frettled> and so on

[15:12] <frettled> We could of course introduce the term «undense».  ;)

[15:13] <frettled> or moose

[15:14] <moritz_> I don't think moose are so undense :-)

[15:14] <frettled> opaque like an idiot or transparent like a fool

[15:15] <masak> Perl 6 aims to be both :)

[15:15] <masak> The objects, for example, are opaque, so you can't look into them.

[15:15] <masak> But on the other hand, classes allow for great introspection.

[15:17] <moritz_> so classes are fools?

[15:17] <masak> there's an OO in fool. :)

[15:18] <masak> but yes, I think classes are something of the court jester in programming.

[15:25] <jonasbn> hello

[15:26] <colomon> masak: sounds cool, but I'd rather have an up-to-date periodic table of operators...  :)

[15:26] <moritz_> hi jonasbn 

[15:26] <Juerd> Nah, let's stop updating old documents and keep producing new ones.

[15:26] <masak> colomon: I thought it was still fairly up-io-date...

[15:26] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, we talked about a perl6 hackathon in Copenhagen at some point

[15:26] <Wolfman2000> The Z operator...it's some sort of zip thing, right?

[15:26] <pmichaud_> yes

[15:26] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, I am ready to start organizing

[15:26] *** drbean left
[15:26] <pmichaud_> jonasbn: excellent.  what timeframe might we be looking at?

[15:26] <masak> Wolfman2000: infix:<Z> and &zip are synonyms.

[15:27] <moritz_> and where will the hackathon be? :-)

[15:27] <pmichaud_> "in Copenhagen"  :-)

[15:27] <masak> Perl 6 hackathon in Copenhagen? woot!

[15:27] <Wolfman2000> masak: I still don't quite get what it does. I'm guessing...since it's using the deck, take the name inside each deck, give it a value, and put those key pairs into the hash.

[15:28] <Wolfman2000> pmichaud_: your online slides don't exactly give an easy way of going to the next one

[15:28] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, well I have two agendas

[15:28] <pmichaud_> start at http://www.pmichaud.com/2009/pres/oscon-perl6op/slides/slide12.html   for an explanation 

[15:29] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, one is to get a "Copenhagen" release

[15:29] <pmichaud_> Wolfman2000: press "spacebar"  or "N" to go to next slide

[15:29] <colomon> masak: don't think it's been updated in six months or so.  I know for sure the S(equential) operators have been added since then, and I'm pretty sure others as well... have to look at the poster to figure out what else has changed.

[15:29] *** Baggio_ left
[15:29] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, the second one is to do it in conjunction with our local open source conference

[15:29] <pmichaud_> jonasbn: when is that?

[15:29] <jonasbn> which is called Open Source days

[15:29] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, in march 2010

[15:29] <Wolfman2000> gotcha

[15:30] <pmichaud_> anyway, the code is explained starting with slide12.html

[15:30] <pmichaud_> (I did this as a lightning talk)

[15:30] <pmichaud_> jonasbn: march 2010 is _perfect_

[15:30] <pmichaud_> looks like march 5 + 6

[15:31] <jonasbn> pmichaud_, 5th. and 6th.

[15:34] <jonasbn> okay, sounds good

[15:34] <pmichaud_> in the meantime, have you discussed it with the open source days 2010 organizers, or do you need to do that?

[15:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, that is the least part :)

[15:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, I expect we do it one way or the other, I just want us to be as effective as possible, so we actually contribute

[15:46] <jonasbn> and I want as many of you guys to participate, to hold our hands

[15:46] <Wolfman2000> ...what day would this take place on anyway? Perhaps there are other ways of me being there without me being there...what are your thoughts of video conferencing?

[15:46] <jonasbn> Wolfman2000, 5th. and 6th.

[15:46] <Wolfman2000> of March?

[15:46] <pmichaud> if we can get   <masak mberends jnthn moritz TimToady>.pick(3)   there I think it can be highly successful

[15:46] <pmichaud> I'd think we might do it in two parts

[15:46] <masak> I'm honoured to be on a list with those names. :)

[15:46] <pmichaud> early March 2010 is when we'll want to be finalizing various pieces for Rakudo*

[15:46] <jonasbn> Wolfman2000, Friday and Saturday

[15:46] <Wolfman2000> ...if there is a way you can get a live feed of me or something, I can hopefully be there too.

[15:46] * Wolfman2000 has a camera on his Mac at least

[15:46] <sbp> chuckle, I just found this: "If you know the perl language, then that is a powerful (if otherwise incomprehensible) language with which to hack together a server." — TimBL, in http://www.w3.org/Provider/ShellScript.html

[15:46] <jonasbn> Wolfman2000, so do I you at least get a picture of me looking confound

[15:46] <pmichaud> so in addition to the conference days themselves, we might want to have a couple of days on either end where the Rakudo* core devs can work on things

[15:46] <moritz_> phenny, ask jnthn there are (tentative) plans for a Perl 6 hackathon on 2010-03-0{5,6} in Copenhagen - would that suit you?

[15:46] <phenny> moritz_: I'll pass that on when jnthn is around.

[15:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, sounds like a good idea

[15:46] <Wolfman2000> jonasbn: you also want to see if we can pull off being there digitally?

[15:46] <masak> sbp: Perl isn't incomprehensible, just insane in a productive-enhancing way. :)

[15:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, we will see if we can set up a venue for you guys

[15:46] <pmichaud> Wolfman2000: hackathons often have an online component -- we often do a bunch via irc

[15:46] <jonasbn> Wolfman2000, I will see what I can do

[15:46] <pmichaud> Wolfman2000: in fact, it's common for two people sitting across a table from each other to be chatting via irc

[15:46] <pmichaud> jonasbn: that would be awesome

[15:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, and a beer component too?

[15:46] <pmichaud> jnthn: would you be able to travel from nlpw to copenhagen fairly quickly?  either immediately before or immediately after?

[15:46] <masak> ash___: I thought that was part of the idea. :)

[15:46] <masak> ash___: ng's gather should eventually be lazy.

[15:47] <jonasbn> jnthn, so at least you are in the neighbourhood, we can arrange our part for you to Saturdays (afternoonish)

[15:47] <pmichaud> ...and is it the gather acting differently, or the take?  ;-)

[15:47] <ash___> masak: well, accoding to the spec (i thought) rakudo: my @a = gather for 1..2 { }; say +@a; #=> 2 not 1 

[15:47] <moritz_> ash___: that's probably because the range 1..2 doesn't work yet

[15:47] <pmichaud> I'm thinking Copenhagen is a lot easier for people to get to than Arnhem :)

[15:48] <pmichaud> I mean, being the "capital of Europe" and all :) :)

[15:52] <masak> good news! the downwards trend since the slashdotting has turned, as of yesterday.

[15:52] <colomon> \o/

[15:52] <Wolfman2000> ...don't tell me it was my post

[15:53] <Wolfman2000> All I did was choose one method, and that was it.

[15:54] <moritz_> Wolfman2000: you should have said "I picked one method" :-)

[15:54] <Wolfman2000> *groan*

[15:54] <jonasbn> well I need to cook dinner, I will join again later

[15:54] <moritz_> and no, it was already rising yesterday

[15:54] <masak> Wolfman2000: the upturn was for the 14th.

[15:54] *** jonasbn left
[15:54] <moritz_> jonasbn++

[15:55] <masak> but it doesn't have to mean anything. we could be down to the point where the number just fluctuates.

[15:55] <colomon> bet it was people who don't look over the weekend catching up.

[15:56] <masak> hm, sounds reasonable.

[15:56] <arnsholt> How many unique visitors does the blog get, roughly?

[15:56] <masak> arnsholt: about 1k a day.

[15:56] <masak> arnsholt: it was 11k the day after the slashdotting.

[15:57] <moritz_> actually it was about 20k in 24 hours

[15:57] <Wolfman2000> since I have to leave soon (I'll stay on IRC), I'll at least leave with one bit of good news.

[15:57] <moritz_> but spread over two days

[15:57] <colomon> masak: that's views rather than unique visitors, isn't it?

[15:57] <arnsholt> 11k is a lot. But 1k should give some good PR as well

[15:57] <Wolfman2000> My final grades came in. I got all As this semester. I'm on my way to become a teacher!

[15:57] <masak> colomon: yes, that might be.

[15:57] <colomon> Wolfman2000: \o/

[15:57] <masak> Wolfman2000: \o/

[15:58] <masak> Frackin' A!

[15:58] <Wolfman2000> *groan* enough with the terrible puns already.

[15:58] <masak> you must be new here. :P

[15:58] <arnsholt> Wolfman2000: One is hardly enough!

[15:58] <Wolfman2000> only a month...

[15:59] <frettled> masak: which what was slashdotted?

[15:59] * frettled has been avoiding /. for the past years.

[15:59] <masak> frettled: I think it was pmichaud++'s metaoperators

[15:59] <frettled> aha

[15:59] <masak> that amused me.

[15:59] <frettled> :)

[16:00] <frettled> Day 12 has some interesting comment questions, but no answers, interesting or otherwise.

[16:00] <frettled> And I don't know how to answer the questions.  Argh!

[16:00] <masak> 1. "Write answer" 2. "Push submit"

[16:00] <frettled> :)

[16:01] <colomon> also the day 1 "getting rakudo" was slashdotted in the same post.

[16:10] <frettled> at least for those who haven't disabled it

[16:11] <masak> frettled: nod. I think the referer logs showed that Slashdot pulled in quite a bit more than Twitter.

[16:56] <frettled> That's the risk you run with IRC servers.

[16:56] <masak> what kind of people DDoS IRC servers? did they frequent too many channels without hugbots?

[16:57] <ash___> frettled: okay, just wondering if it was me, the internet in my area died for a long time yesterday, just making sure it wasn't my internet

[16:57] <Infinoid> masak: arguably, more hugbots are always better

[16:57] <ash___> masak: so, ummm i never saw your response about gather/tak 

[16:57] <ash___> gather/take

[16:57] <moritz_> diakopter: re 5600 lines, I have no idea where that number comes from.

[16:58] <ash___> in the ng branch, it does indeed seem lazy, so lazy it can't cant itself :P, because shouldn't my @a = gather for 1..2 {}; say +@a; #=> 2  ? 

[16:59] <diakopter> oh, whoops, it *was* masak who said that

[16:59] <moritz_> ash___: 1..2 doesn't work in ng yet

[16:59] <masak> diakopter: I knew it! :P

[17:57] <masak> huh -- nobody is doing smartmatching for the advent calendar.

[17:57] <masak> that's a pity.

[17:57] <frettled> masak: then that's a good Christmas morning bonus entry!

[17:57] <masak> :)

[17:58] <yath> the christmas bonus entry should be rakudo star :P

[17:58] <coke> ... gruntlebuggies?

[17:58] * coke is wondering if the portion of his brain devoted to D. Adams is correctly riffing on frettled's nick.

[17:59] * coke is, it seems, close.

[17:59] <frettled> :D

[17:59] <masak> 'fredded'

[17:59] <frettled> coke: I think Mr. Adams used the spelling «freddled».  «Oh, freddled gruntlebuggit!  Thy micturations are to me, like <something> to a lurgid bee!»

[17:59] <frettled> Or something like that.

[18:00] <coke> micturations?

[18:00] * coke needs to dig up an emulator and set up his kids to play the text game.

[18:00] *** nothingmuch joined
[18:00] <frettled> try «vogon poetry» on Wikipedia :)

[18:00] <frettled> Ah, there it is:

[18:00] <frettled> "Oh freddled gruntbuggly?thy micturations are to me/As plurdled gabbleblotchis on a lurgid bee. Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes. And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,/ Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!"

[18:01] *** rodi joined
[18:04] <TimToady> masak: the one on junctions mentions talks about smartmatching some

[18:04] <masak> thanks. I'll read it.

[19:05] <moritz_> probably. My python-fu is too weak :-)

[19:05] <moritz_> but it gives the type object associated with an object

[19:05] <new2perl6> moritz_: Ha. You're excused. ;)

[19:05] *** woody__ joined
[19:05] <moritz_> actually I wanted to learn python to hack up `cplay' a bit

[19:05] <moritz_> but... I have to hand in my diploma thesis in 3 days. Yikes.

[19:05] *** ejs left
[19:05] <colomon> what's it on?

[19:05] <new2perl6> moritz_: Oh my. You're extra busy this week.

[19:05] <moritz_> colomon: "Ballistic Transport of Spin-Polarized Electron Beams in Mesoscopic

[19:05] <moritz_> Systems"

[19:05] *** woody__ left
[19:05] <colomon> That's a mouthful.  :)

[19:05] <new2perl6> moritz_: You say "basically, yes" that everything is a reference (except for some "value types"). Does Perl 6 still copy on assignment, like Perl 5? In Python, when you assign one variable to another, you get 2 references pointing to the same object.

[19:05] <TimToady> new2perl6: Perl 6 distinguishes assignment from binding

[19:05] <TimToady> use := to get the Python semantics

[19:05] *** ShaneC joined
[19:05] <new2perl6> TimToady: Ah. Ok. So, by default, we get the usual expected "make a copy of this" behaviour.

[19:05] <TimToady> moritz_: is "mesoscopic" smaller or larger than a flea?

[19:05] <moritz_> TimToady: smaller. Small enough to observe quantum effects

[19:05] <new2perl6> TimToady: I mean, by default using the `=`.

[19:05] <TimToady> well, Penrose speculated that flea-sized was the boundary :)

[19:05] <moritz_> TimToady: in our systems it's a few micrometers

[19:05] <moritz_> but I don't see why there should be an upper boundary for quantum effects (but that's not really a topic I've studied)

[19:06] <TimToady> http://www.bartleby.com/100/211.5.html

[19:06] *** KyleHa left
[19:06] <rodi> moritz_: Penrose (again) thinks it's how (and why) your brain works.

[19:24] <new2perl6> moritz_: Sorry, I guess this is getting pretty far off-topic from my original question. :)

[19:24] <moritz_> new2perl6: something along these lines, yes

[19:24] <moritz_> and no, perl 6 is never off-topic here :-)

[19:24] <colomon> moritz_: Never mind my last request, just remembered I had DiffMerge sitting around on my system.

[19:24] <new2perl6> moritz_: Yes, but it's easy to suffer from this condition where, instead of reading the Synopses you just come to #perl6 and keep asking questions. :)

[19:24] <TimToady> rodi: well, False is 0 and True is 1 if you force numeric

[19:24] <new2perl6> moritz_: s/you/I/

[19:24] <moritz_> new2perl6: so did I, reading the Synopsis is hard at first, and they don't answer all your questions :-)

[19:25] <rodi> TimToady: yeah, should have been more specific- I would like to pick two specific characters at render time (e.g. Bool::True is an X and Bool::False is a .)

[19:25] <new2perl6> Thanks all. Bye.

[19:25] <pmichaud> ...is masak++'s "scanning" example correct?

[19:25] <pmichaud> (for the next perl6advent post)

[19:25] <moritz_> ('X', ' ')[?$x]

[19:25] <rodi> I have a version of it working where I simply stringify the whole array and .subst on the 1's and 0's.

[19:26] <moritz_> erm, actually revert those items in the list

[19:26] <TimToady> <. X>[+$x] I think, if $x is already a Bool

[19:27] <pmichaud> phenny: tell masak   I think the p6advent post ought to mention that "when" works in any block that sets $_

[19:27] <phenny> pmichaud: I'll pass that on when masak is around.

[19:27] <pmichaud> phenny: in the scanning example, I think you may want to drop the  "-> $line"  in "for $*IN.lines -> $line {"

[19:27] <pmichaud> er

[19:28] <rodi> I find endless amusement by replacing methods and classes by characters and words.

[19:28] <pmichaud> phenny: tell masak in the scanning example, I think you may want to drop the  "-> $line"  in "for $*IN.lines -> $line {"

[19:28] <phenny> pmichaud: I'll pass that on when masak is around.

[19:28] <moritz_> <. X>[+$x] looks like a nice fish operator :-)

[19:28] <rodi> moritz_, TimToady, thanks, works great.

[19:28] <rodi> heh.

[19:28] <pmichaud> looks like a mutant fish, though.

[19:54] <colomon> Hmmm.... looking at day 16 post.

[19:54] <colomon> next when $line ~~ '';  strikes me as a bit weird.

[19:55] <moritz_> for ... { next when '' } would be better

[19:55] <jnthn> wants to be next if no?

[19:55] <moritz_> and using $_ instead of $line

[19:55] <jnthn> well, only use when it testing the topic, yes

[19:55] <colomon> I would also explain that when and if are basically the same, except if always "continues".

[19:56] <moritz_> not the same. 'when' does smart matching, 'if' coerces to Bool

[19:56] <colomon> I guess my issue is, won't the when statement automatically "next" if it fires?

[19:57] <moritz_> right

[19:58] <colomon> rakudo; given 10.0 { if Num { say "I'm a Num"; }; };

[19:59] <colomon> rakudo: given 10.0 { if Num { say "I'm a Num"; }; };

[20:53] <pmichaud> there will be a big announcement when we switch to ng (more precisely, ng will be renamed "master")

[20:53] <moritz_> masak: also notice that 'next when...' is a bit weird

[20:54] <ash___> okay, thanks pmichaud 

[20:54] <moritz_> masak: siince 'when' already implies somethiing similar to 'next'

[20:54] <moritz_> as colomon++ pointed out

[20:54] <masak> moritz_: it's tautological, but not fatally so.

[20:54] <eiro> masak, bug reports/contribs on proto: is there the good place to chat about it ? 

[20:54] *** [synth] joined
[20:54] <masak> eiro: here is fine.

[20:54] <moritz_> here!

[20:54] <eiro> ok

[20:54] <moritz_> bug reports supposedly go to the github bug tracker

[20:55] <eiro> moritz_, yep but i don't know the good strategy to patch

[20:55] <eiro> i noticed there is no verbose mode. is it ok to add a GetOption 

[20:55] <eiro> to remove the usage of dotty-progress 

[20:56] <colomon> masak: I believe it works, it just seems like a confusing example.

[20:56] <eiro> ./proto --verbose --gen-parrot-anyway 

[20:56] <masak> colomon: agreed.

[20:59] <colomon> btw, it's a great post.  I love given / when...

[20:59] <masak> me too. :) that's why I claimed the topic early.

[20:59] <masak> oh, I should briefly mention CATCH, also.

[21:02] <TimToady> next as a statement modifier does not imply break semantics

[21:02] <TimToady> s/next/when/ grr

[21:02] <masak> I was thinking about that.

[21:02] <TimToady> so "next when" is not redundant

[21:02] <masak> does the spec mention that?

[21:03] <TimToady> yes

[21:03] <TimToady> but nobody reads that.... :/

[21:03] <masak> :P

[21:03] <masak> TimToady: I haven't backlogged yet; did you see my block parsing heads-up?

[21:03] <TimToady> S04:923

[21:04] *** shachaf1 left
[21:05] <TimToady> haven't had a chance to look at that yet.  it may be that we can relax that restriction, which was put in for pugs

[21:05] <jonasbn> pmichaud, have got first response from the OSD organizers about the hackathon - they are VERY positive

[21:05] <masak> TimToady: sounds good. I've never felt a use for it, fwiw.

[21:06] <jonasbn> pmichaud, they inquire if it would be possible to get some 45 min. presentations from some of you guys as part of the bargain

[21:07] <masak> I wouldn't mind giving a presentation.

[21:07] <jonasbn> masak, great :)

[21:08] <moritz_> if I'm able to come, I'll also volunteer for a talk

[21:08] <jonasbn> I will try to collect the threads, is there a better way to contact your guys than via IRC? - like a mailing list or something

[21:08] <moritz_> jonasbn: [email@hidden.address] should work

[21:09] <masak> I'd say IRC is the better way, but YMMV. :)

[21:09] <jonasbn> moritz_, thanks, IRC is great but for giving you the complete picture, I might prefer email

[21:10] <TimToady> masak: I think that rule predates the notion that the inside of bracketing constructs is a statement in its own right.

[21:10] <pmichaud> jonasbn: I am always glad to give presentations

[21:10] <masak> TimToady: aha.

[21:10] <TimToady> now that it is, it doesn't matter if the inner } thinks its terminating a statement

[21:10] <TimToady> so I think we can remove the exception

[21:10] *** patspam joined
[21:10] <masak> \o/

[21:11] <jonasbn> I think the OSD people are quite interested in the parrot aspect in more general terms, the majority are not necessarily perl h4X0rs

[21:13] <jonasbn> masak, yes, it is going to be FUN!

[21:13] <pmichaud> we're looking at putting together a Perl 6 hackathon or workshop at that time

[21:13] <masak> frettled: don't snicker, it could happen to you! :P

[21:20] *** hanekomu_ joined
[21:20] <frettled> 一三三七

[21:20] <pmichaud> jonasbn: right now I see three aspects to a workshop (more)

[21:21] * TimToady is entertained

[21:21] <pmichaud> one is to participate in osd, to get the word out about perl 6

[21:21] <pmichaud> another is to provide a venue for people to help with hacking

[21:21] <pmichaud> or to learn how to get started with hacking

[21:22] <pmichaud> and a third is as a dedicated workshop for many of the core Rakudo contributors to meet to clear things in preparation for Rakudo*

[21:22] <moritz_> we could also be presenthing the Perl 6 book

[21:22] <pmichaud> and yes, that also

[21:22] <mberends> jonasbn: I'm also happy to give a presentation to OSD

[21:22] <jonasbn> pmichaud, that sounds like what we want to aim for

[21:22] <pmichaud> however, it looks as though one of our key players (jnthn) won't be able to make it directly to osd

[21:23] <frettled> oh :(

[21:23] <pmichaud> because he has a commitment to dutch perl workshop

[21:23] <jonasbn> pmichaud, I personally just want to have a "Copenhagen" release ;-)

[21:23] <pmichaud> jonasbn: oh, I'm sure we can arrange that :)

[21:23] <pmichaud> a few of us had already been exploring "how and where can we get a rakudo hackathon in early 2010" -- you just popped in at the perfect time

[21:23] <jonasbn> pmichaud, what if the hackathon would be saturday and sunday, the dutch perl workshop is friday

[21:24] <pmichaud> jonasbn: yes, that's what I'm thinking

[21:24] <pmichaud> some of us can attend osd on friday, to present and participate there 

[21:24] <mberends> pmichaud: jnthn, myself and whoever else is interested could drive from Arnhem to Copenhagen together

[21:24] <pmichaud> then we can have a general hackathon on saturday and sunday

[21:24] <pmichaud> then, depending on who can stay (and both jonathan and I can), some continued rakudo* work for a couple of days after that

[21:26] <pmichaud> as far as what we need, it depends on how many show up

[21:26] <pmichaud> in general we just need a room or rooms with wifi, some writing surfaces, and availability of hacking fuel (food and/or nearby eating places)

[21:26] <jonasbn> so it is actually the number of participants setting the requirement

[21:27] <pmichaud> pretty much

[21:27] <jonasbn> do you have an upper limit?

[21:27] <pmichaud> my experience is that they tend to be self-limiting by who can come (and when), but 30 would seem to be a top upper limit

[21:27] <pmichaud> I need to look at the structure of osd a bit as well

[21:28] <pmichaud> it also depends on how many mentors are available

[21:28] *** imaltb left
[21:28] <pmichaud> (i.e., people who can help guide others)

[21:28] <pmichaud> any idea how many people we'd be likely to attract from the copenhagen area?

[21:29] <jonasbn> pmichaud, not at this time, but I would prefer if the attendant primarily are local

[21:29] <jonasbn> with you guys to help us out

[21:30] <pmichaud> that seems workable.  At the moment we're looking that there may be about 6 of "us guys" helping out

[21:31] <frettled> I'm tempted to make this an excuse to go to CPH again.  Don't worry, I'm house trained.  ;)

[21:32] <pmichaud> so if there's around 20-30 participants overall, that could be good.  I suspect we might do some "structured introduction" at the first part of the hackathon, to introduce newbies to Perl 6 and how things are put together, and then break up into smaller groups or individual tasks where people can hack on whatever they think will be most interesting.  That formula worked extremely well at NPW earlier this year.

[21:32] <jonasbn> then that is what we do

[21:33] <jonasbn> what is your take on spectators

[21:33] <jonasbn> I mean regular OSD attendees

[21:33] <pmichaud> that'd be fine with me, unless you envision a problem

[21:33] <pmichaud> to me "spectator"  is "rakudo hacker who doesn't realize it yet"

[21:33] <pmichaud> :-)

[21:33] <jonasbn> much of the stuff is normally "configuration", so I really look forward to putting the open source into open source days :)

[21:34] <jonasbn> pmichaud, great, since this is propably what we have to deal with

[21:34] <pmichaud> works for me

[21:34] <pmichaud> I may start a google group for this topic

[21:34] <jonasbn> please feel free

[21:34] <pmichaud> I'll do that later today

[21:34] <jonasbn> or a wave :)

[21:34] <Tene> wave isn't public access yet

[21:35] <coke> I have wave invites if anyone wants one.

[21:35] <jonasbn> Tene, you want an invite?

[21:35] <pmichaud> I'll take an invite :)

[21:35] <coke> pmichaud: incoming.

[21:36] *** payload joined
[21:36] <jonasbn> pmichaud, a google group will do

[21:36] <pmichaud> mberends:  if driving from arnhem to copenhagen, what's the expected availability in copenhagen?

[21:36] <pmichaud> yes, I'll do a google group for now.

[21:36] <pmichaud> I'll pre-subscribe the people commenting here (let me know if you wish to not be subscribed)

[21:37] <Tene> jonasbn: I'm on wave already, but many potentially interested people aren't.

[21:37] <Tene> pmichaud: please subscribe me.

[21:37] <pmichaud> Tene: will do.

[21:37] <mberends> pmichaud: driving 7-9 hours overnight, arriving early Saturday morning

[21:38] <pmichaud> mberends: that could work out really well, if people aren't too tired :)

[21:38] <mberends> timezones are in the mind ;)

[21:38] <jonasbn> what about night train?

[21:38] * mberends will look, but fears the price

[21:38] <jonasbn> that all can have a beer

[21:38] <jonasbn> s/that/then/

[21:38] <mberends> :)

[21:39] <pmichaud> I was even thinking of trying to make it to Dutch Perl Workshop in that case... but I'm not sure it's good for me and jnthn to both be in the same vehicle for an overnight trip in the cold of winter in scandinavia :)

[21:39] <mberends> I'll drive *really* carefully

[21:39] <jonasbn> I will investigate sponsorship options in adition, so do not make any decision based on economy just yet

[21:39] <jnthn> pmichaud: meh, Denmark is the unhardcore point of Scandinavia.

[21:39] <jnthn> ;-)

[21:40] <jnthn> No polar bears and extreme snow there, right? :-)

[21:40] <pmichaud> it did concern me a bit in 2005 when I was driving a vehicle containing both TimToady and audreyt :)

[21:40] <jonasbn> jnthn, weatherwise yes - coastal climate and no mountains

[21:40] <mberends> March should be early spring

[21:40] <jonasbn> jnthn, I can take you to the zoo :)

[21:41] <pmichaud> I think there may also be some sponsorship opportunities from other sources as well

[21:41] <pmichaud> and if there's a strong Rakudo* component, we may be able to use hague funds to support some of this

[21:43] <Tene> I remember this was also discussed at PDS.

[21:44] *** d4l3k_ is now known as dalek

[21:45] <eiro> is there a prefered choice ? 

[21:45] <jonasbn> pmichaud, who are the 6 of you? - is that the complete list you mentioned earlier?

[21:45] <pmichaud> jonasbn: basically, depending on who can make it.

[21:45] <Tene> eiro: if you're just playing a bit, no difference.

[21:45] <jnthn> mberends: There is a night train Koln - Copenhagen.

[21:45] <colomon> pmichaud:  I guess I would be interested in being on the IRC support end of things for the hacking, at least a bit.  (depending on time zones, I suppose  :)

[21:45] <eiro> thx Tene 

[21:46] <jonasbn> pmichaud, okay and sponsorships is a great motivator I guess

[21:46] <jnthn> mberends: That depends on getting to Koln by 21:00 or so, iirc.

[21:46] <pmichaud> as I said, we were already starting to try to put something together for the list I gave earlier

[21:46] <pmichaud> one of the things we didn't yet have was an event+location that was in the right time frame and generally easy for folks to get to

[21:50] <pmichaud> anyone remember about how many perl6-hackers we had at npw?

[21:55] <moritz_> where's that YAML.pm everybody keeps talking about?

[21:55] <mberends> eiro: proto needs to be self contained, to begin installing any modules

[22:00] <coke> odd. perl6 queue has 279 new and 279 open tickets.

[23:19] <Wolfman2000> Nothing wrong with shortcuts, but often times roleplaying games also look at the values of individual dice, not just the total.

[23:24] <frettled> I want to write a reply to the reply^3, but I think it may turn into a blog entry instead.

[23:24] <frettled> Yet another excuse for delaying my post about time, the setting, and Temporal.pm.

[23:26] <carlin> http://gist.github.com/257402#file_gistfile1.txt # What does it mean if rakudo keeps dying with this output?

[23:27] <Tene> That's a Parrot bug.

[23:28] <Tene> You should report it to parrot and open a trac ticket about it, ideally.

[23:28] <Tene> The GC and calling conventions are getting some attention lately, so chances are good of getting someone to notice it.

[23:28] <Tene> If you could identify which line it's failing on, that would be ideal.

[23:31] * IllvilJa impatiently checking the Perl 6 advent calendar (it has been December 16th for over 30 minutes now in Sweden...)

[23:33] <carlin> IllvilJa: it has been the 16th for 12 hours and 30 minutes here :-)

[23:34] <jnthn> carlin: ooh...what are the winning lottery numbers for the morning draw? ;-)

[23:34] <IllvilJa> The men from the future :-D.  We are time travelers!

[23:36] <Wolfman2000> The post for the 16th is to come in...at least 30 minutes from now

[23:36] <carlin> Tene: filled the program with warn statements, so I'll wait until it crashes again and then open a trac ticket

[23:36] <Tene> carlin: Great, thanks.
