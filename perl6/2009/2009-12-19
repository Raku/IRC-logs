[08:57] <meneldor> hello moritz_ , i forgot about rakudo on win32 and installed it successfully on my ubuntu

[08:57] <meneldor> now i read your PDF book

[08:58] <meneldor> but it starts with JSON tutorial?

[08:58] *** Baggio_ left
[08:58] <meneldor> is this the right book to start reading for perl5 to perl6 ?

[08:59] <moritz_> meneldor: it shouldn't start with JSON

[09:00] <meneldor> i've opened a link from the blog

[09:00] <moritz_> http://cloud.github.com/downloads/perl6/book/book-2009-12.pdf

[09:01] *** lumi_ joined
[09:01] <meneldor> http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/we-write-a-perl-6-book-for-you.html

[09:01] <meneldor> this one

[09:01] <moritz_> meneldor: there are newer versions than the one linked on my blog, we have monthly releases

[09:01] <moritz_> and that was the first one

[09:01] <meneldor> :)

[09:01] <meneldor> ok tnx

[09:01] <moritz_> maybe we should have a permanent link which always points to the latest

[09:02] *** colomon left
[09:02] <meneldor> ah this book is different thing :) thank you moritz_ 

[09:03] *** meppl joined
[09:04] <moritz_> meneldor: it still has a chapter about parsing JSON

[09:05] <meneldor> i can read about it if i start to use perl6 for web later :)

[09:05] <meneldor> now i use json module for catalyst with perl5

[09:05] <moritz_> you can also use the knowledge for parsing something else than JSON

[09:06] *** Baggio_ joined
[09:06] <meneldor> ok but how perl6 use local module libraries?

[09:06] <meneldor> do he use own lib path?

[09:07] <moritz_> if you put modules into ~/.perl6/lib/ rakudo will find them

[09:07] <moritz_> or you can set the PERL6LIB environment variable

[09:07] <moritz_> or you can say BEGIN { @*INC.push: '/path/to/lib' } in your module

[09:07] <meneldor> i see

[09:08] <meneldor> is there a way like in perl5 to install from cpan directly to perl6 lib

[09:08] *** Baggio_ left
[09:09] <meneldor> like: cpan6 install Module

[09:09] *** nihiliad left
[09:09] <moritz_> there's an installer called "proto"

[09:09] <moritz_> http://github.com/masak/proto/

[09:10] <moritz_> you have to checkout the installed-modules branch

[09:10] <moritz_> and then you can try ./proto install json

[09:10] <meneldor> tnx

[09:27] * moritz_ is a vim user

[09:28] <Su-Shee> so am I. gvim with shiny tabs ;)

[09:35] <meneldor> im trying this from the book: my @names = $file.get.split(' ');

[09:35] *** agentzh joined
[09:35] <meneldor> but it throws an error

[09:35] <meneldor> Could not locate a method 'get' to invoke on class 'IO'.

[09:36] <meneldor> there are 6-7 additional lines below this error

[09:37] <lisppaste3> meneldor pasted "untitled" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/92346

[09:41] * frettled is a whimsical user.

[09:41] <meneldor> can anyone help me with this error please

[09:42] *** lumi joined
[09:42] *** ashizawa joined
[09:42] <meneldor> is this my fault or this code is obsolete?

[09:44] <frettled> I'm sorry, I'm still too much of a n00b to help you with that.  :(

[09:46] <mberends> meneldor: please paste your script file

[09:47] *** frettled sets mode: +oo mberends Su-Shee

[09:47] * frettled idles again.  :)

[09:48] <mberends> if you successfully open a file, get works

[09:49] *** mikehh left
[09:49] *** mikehh joined
[09:50] <meneldor> if i only use open it works

[09:50] <meneldor> this error appear when i use $file.get.split(' ');

[09:58] <moritz_> meneldor: and did you create the data files first?

[09:59] *** agentzh left
[09:59] *** Baggio_ joined
[09:59] <meneldor> yes

[09:59] <meneldor> i wrote file named the same way with the same data inside

[10:00] *** justin_ joined
[10:01] *** Alias joined
[10:02] *** justin_ left
[10:02] <moritz_> that's weird

[10:02] <moritz_> but I'm afraid I can't investigate right now, have to leave rather soon

[10:03] <mberends> copy the source code from the book pdf give the wrong kind of quote characters

[10:04] <mberends> *copying, gives, gah, fingers too cold

[10:04] <meneldor> mberends: i've changed them :)

[10:05] <mberends> Also fixing more of them here. The original git version would be more reliable for copying.

[10:07] <mberends> works now. beware of backticks pretending to be single quotes

[10:08] <meneldor> the line: my @names = $file.get.split(' ');

[10:08] <meneldor> is hand written

[10:09] <mberends> check every quote/backtick on all lines

[10:14] <meneldor> well i did it

[10:14] <meneldor> i tryed this: my $file = open 'scores'; say $file;

[10:14] <meneldor> it prints: IO<0xb5fbe380>

[10:15] <mberends> $file is an open file object, ok

[10:15] <meneldor> but it means that OPEN works

[10:15] <meneldor> then if i use get it throws an error

[10:16] <mberends> pasting my copy, then you can diff them

[10:16] *** vamped joined
[10:17] <meneldor> your copy?

[10:18] *** vamped left
[10:20] <meneldor> here is my perl6 version: This is Rakudo Perl 6, revision 37414 built on parrot 0.9.1-devel

[10:20] <lisppaste3> mberends pasted "book example for meneldor" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/92347

[10:22] <meneldor> mberends: the same error :(

[10:22] <mberends> meneldor: your parrot is too old, you should get newer parrot and rakudo

[10:22] <meneldor> but i installed it 1 hour before

[10:22] <mberends> you downloaded from an old site

[10:22] <meneldor> oh no

[10:23] <mberends> parrot is now 1.8

[10:23] <meneldor> i use http://www.rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo

[10:23] * mberends looks

[10:24] <meneldor> then i downloaded  	rakudo-2009-12.tar.gz

[10:24] <meneldor> then: perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot

[10:24] <meneldor> and it check some thinks in the site i think

[10:25] <mberends> it could be that your search path is finding an earlier install instead of the new one

[10:25] *** mikehh left
[10:26] <meneldor> nope, i start perl6 executable in the same directory i've builded

[10:26] <mberends> try 'which perl6' and verify the directory

[10:27] *** lumi_ joined
[10:27] <mberends> the 0.9.1 must be removed with extreme prejudice

[10:28] <meneldor> ill try to compile it again

[10:29] <mberends> just remove all the new stuff first, and verify that you have *no* old version left

[10:29] <meneldor> this is the first time i install perl6

[10:30] <mberends> which OS is this on?

[10:30] <meneldor> ubuntu

[10:30] *** lumi left
[10:30] <meneldor> hmm now is different i think

[10:30] <meneldor> Checked out revision 43076.

[10:30] <mberends> ok, I'll try the webpage download in /tmp on another ubuntu pc

[10:31] <meneldor> wait

[10:31] <meneldor> let me compile it

[10:33] <mberends> 43076 sounds good, I'm using 42558

[10:34] *** rfordinal joined
[10:35] <meneldor> i might had been installed from old archive

[10:37] <meneldor> nice!

[10:37] <meneldor> tnx mberends 

[10:37] <meneldor> now all works

[10:37] <meneldor> i dont know how i've installed that old version before :)

[10:38] * mberends remembers the birth of 'get' at NPW in Oslo

[10:38] <meneldor> well today im starting to migrate from perl5

[10:38] <meneldor> cheers for the help mberends 

[10:39] <mberends> meneldor: you're very welcome

[10:39] <meneldor> here is the old version I've installed before: http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo

[10:40] <meneldor> when you click Download it sends you some archive rakudo-rakudo-26262626.tar.gz

[10:40] <meneldor> then i've downloaded rakudo-2009-12.tar.gz and all is OK

[10:41] <mberends> the site is current, but the tar file may be obsolete

[12:03] *** colomon joined
[12:04] <masak> I think, in all humility of course, that it's one of the areas where Perl 6 will be more adaptable than Perl 5.

[12:04] <Alias> From my perspective, Perl 6 is worse

[12:04] <Alias> Because the grammar is utterly intangible

[12:05] <Alias> And modules only have a valid document structure if they also compile

[12:06] <Alias> Does P6 have a BEGIN equivalent?

[12:06] *** Baggio_ joined
[12:06] <Alias> Is it possible to do code injection into the compiler?

[12:06] <masak> oh, sure.

[12:07] <masak> macros, defined operators, defined other pieces of syntax...

[12:07] <masak> but it's, er, homoiconic in a way that Perl 5 isn't.

[12:08] <rachelBROWN> what would be the best way to go about donating LSD to the most active contributors of perl6

[12:09] <masak> rachelBROWN: are you really sure that's what's needed at this juncture? :P

[12:10] <masak> how about we just make sure the ng branch merges instead?

[12:10] <rachelBROWN> perl6 is supposed to do everything, right?

[12:10] *** kidd joined
[12:10] <rachelBROWN> I thing LSD would help us with that.

[12:10] <huf> no, just 70% of that

[12:11] <masak> rachelBROWN: I see your point, but... I think most people believe more in LTM around here.

[12:13] <rachelBROWN> Large Telescope Metalanguage?

[12:13] <masak> no, but I like the sound of that. :)

[12:14] <masak> Longest-Token Matching.

[12:14] <huf> hmm, my LTM mislead me about the meaning of LTM

[12:15] *** araujo joined
[12:15] <masak> huf: you have a telescope? :)

[12:20] <huf> i meant long-term memory ;) no scope, only vision here.

[12:23] <masak> oh. well, hindsight is 20-20.

[12:24] <huf> you are correct. i have 0 eyes in the back of my head.

[12:33] *** Su-Shee_ is now known as Su-Shee

[12:33] <masak> if nothing else, we're pun junkies.

[12:34] <huf> best kind of junkie. 

[12:34] * Su-Shee can stop punning every day, if I want to.

[12:34] <huf> right after each pun? and until the next one? impressive.

[12:35] *** mjk left
[12:35] <Su-Shee> just a question of will. and a backspace key in good working condition.

[12:36] <masak> the first step is admitting that one is a punster.

[12:36] <Su-Shee> "hello masak!" ;)

[12:36] <carlin> Friends don't let friends use puns

[12:36] <masak> hi.

[12:36] <masak> my name is masak, and I pun.

[12:37] <huf> hmm, this could lead to the punic wars if we arent careful

[12:37] <masak> I started punning when I was 15, sneaking behind the school building and punning where nobody heard me.

[12:37] <Su-Shee> huf: you'll have to pay for that one. ;)

[12:37] <carlin> Good idea, make a pun jar

[12:38] <Su-Shee> there is actually such a thing in english? I always had difficulties translating the german word.

[12:38] <huf> one of intermediate size no longer used in the west?

[12:38] <huf> (but still used in strife-torn bolivia as a reminder of better days)

[15:07] <masak> mberends: any particular reason the 'hello world' example in the README is 'print "howdy!"' and not 'say "howdy!"'?

[15:07] <masak> the latter gives nicer output, and is more of a moral boost, since it's a Perl6ism.

[15:08] <masak> s/moral/morale/

[15:11] <mberends> masak: there was a trivial reason.  I thought I would leave 'say' as a piece of LHF to tempt some hacker to implement it in terms of the existing 'print' ;)

[15:12] <masak> ahah. :)

[15:12] <mberends> so please do

[15:12] <arnsholt> I like the idea of leaving stuff to trick new people into contributing

[15:12] <masak> still building LLVM... :)

[15:12] <mberends> "trick" ? are you insinuating ?

[15:13] <arnsholt> I'd never insinuate anything O=)

[15:14] <arnsholt> But more seriously, it sounds like a good idea. Having some stuff that people not intimately familiar with the codebase can do might be a good way of attracting more contributors

[15:14] <mberends> innocently put, it's optimizing -Ofun for the maximum number of people

[15:15] <mberends> diakopter++ got me into Sprixel that, intentionally or not

[15:16] <mberends> *like that # fingers too cold

[15:19] <masak> is your IRC client outside?

[15:20] <mberends> the shop that sells inkjet cartridges was a short walk away :)

[15:22] <masak> mberends: this only creates more questions. :)

[15:23] <masak> does your IRC client need ink?

[15:24] <masak> will the inkjet cartridge salesmen be the first against the wall when the revolution comes?

[15:24] <masak> etc.

[15:24] <mberends> this FAQ will need to become bigger than planned :)

[15:26] <masak> by the way, compiling LLVM takes a long time.

[15:27] <mberends> hmm. did you read about not building for *all* targets?

[15:28] <mberends> the default LLVM can cross compile to numerous CPUs

[15:28] <masak> is that so?

[15:28] <masak> no, I just followed the build instructions in the documentation.

[15:30] <mberends> ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-optimized --enable-targets=host-only ?

[15:30] <mberends> (from the vill README)

[15:31] <masak> oh.

[15:31] <masak> I'll abort and do like that then.

[15:31] <masak> thanks.

[15:31] <mberends> without that, it adds about 10 CPU backends

[15:32] <mberends> it still took me 25 45 minutes

[15:32] <mberends> 25 - 45 minutes system dependent

[16:21] * mberends thinks

[16:22] <mberends> ok, gcc on OS X may have a different set of C/C++ lib defaults and cannot statically link malloc()

[16:22] <masak> sounds plausible.

[16:33] <holli> to be honest, i have absolutely no perl6 experience. was just thinking i try at latest rakudo (given all the talk about rakudo* lately). but when i see that a simple

[16:33] <holli> example from the advent calendar doesnt run i'm effectively discouraged.

[16:34] <holli> i mean it's map not working, map!

[16:34] *** lumi left
[16:35] <masak> holli: there are a couple of known issues with the Whatever * and operators.

[16:35] <mberends> masak: finally reading every word in your error gist, the make has not reached the library linking stage yet. The C++ compiler does not have the include dir that contains malloc.h in its search path. This is a typical reason why projects have to run a configure before make, to patch the Makefile. I was hoping to avoid having to do that :(

[16:35] <masak> holli: I agree that it's unfortunate that one such example crept into the Advent Calendar.

[16:36] <masak> holli: but I won't lie to you -- you're bound to run into similar omissions here and there. it's possible to write elaborate things on top of Rakudo, but one has to work and know which deficiencies to avoid.

[16:36] <masak> mberends: ah, so it's more of your fault than mine? ;)

[16:37] <mberends> yes, ok, blame me, Richard Stallman and Steve Jobs

[16:45] <colomon> I'm with holli.  Why the heck isn't there a .eval method on Str?  Makes perfectly good sense to me...

[16:45] <masak> it does.

[16:45] <mberends> holli++

[16:45] <masak> let's add it while no-one's looking :)

[16:45] <colomon> Okay, give me sec.  :)

[16:45] <holli> i contributed to perl6 =) =) =)

[16:45] <masak> if someone else does the spec, I'll do Rakudo.

[16:45] <colomon> or you get the spec and I'll get ng.

[16:46] <masak> I was thinking master.

[16:46] <masak> holli++ indeed.

[16:47] <colomon> Should it be on Any or just Str?

[16:47] <mberends> eval expects Str

[16:48] *** mj41 joined
[16:48] <masak> I added it. running spectests.

[16:48] <colomon> really?

[16:48] <colomon> masak: did you do Any.eval or Str.eval?

[16:49] <colomon> masak: that's why it's easier to do it in ng.  :)

[16:49] <masak> I put it in Any-str,pm, but I coerce to Str.

[16:49] <colomon> eval ~self  ?

[16:49] <masak> yes.

[16:49] <colomon> that's exactly what I wrote here.  :)

[16:49] <masak> not much room for variation :)

[16:50] <colomon> could have been eval self.Str, I suppose.

[16:50] <masak> actually, I used parentheses, because Damian told me so.

[16:50] <masak> (and I agree)

[16:50] <colomon> really?

[16:51] *** abra joined
[16:52] <masak> yes. parentheses save lives.

[16:54] <colomon> ng spectest passes (no parens)

[16:55] <colomon> seems like Code should have a method version as well?

[16:55] <colomon> Callable?

[16:55] * holli fights to surpress a xkcd reference

[16:57] <holli> a new quoting style for filenames? neat.

[16:57] <masak> colomon: how do you figure that? why not just .() the Callable?

[16:57] <masak> colomon: there's no corresponding subroutine eval for Callable.

[16:57] <holli> is there a Perl6 book worth reading?

[16:57] <colomon> ah

[16:57] <carlin> holli: Now I'm curious, which xkcd? :-)

[16:57] <masak> holli: it's not done yet, but yes. definitely.

[16:58] <masak> holli: it's written for people like you.

[16:58] <holli> http://xkcd.com/297/ of course

[16:59] <mberends> not 224 for a change

[16:59] <carlin> Ah, I was thinking 224

[16:59] <carlin> mberends++ # heh

[17:00] <colomon> ng spectest passes (parens)

[17:00] * mberends likes 297 as well

[17:01] <carlin> xkcd really is a great, so we'll forgive him for 353 ;-)

[17:02] <masak> carlin: nothing to forgive, really. :)

[17:02] <masak> just because Python has some positive qualities doesn't mean Perl is bad, or one shouldn't use Perl...

[17:02] <TimToady> I have more of a hard time forgiving xkcd for not realizing you can end a Perl program with a right parenthesis

[17:03] <holli> masak: i'm a good proofreader =)

[17:03] <masak> holli: excellent.

[17:04] <mberends> holli: right paren, on cue

[17:04] <carlin> masak: the alt text

[17:05] <holli> mberends: huh?

[17:05] <masak> carlin: ah. that might be something that needs forgiveness. :)

[17:06] <colomon> BTW, Any.eval pushed to ng.

[17:06] <mberends> holli: TimToady asks for right parentheses and you type one before (probably) reading his remark

[17:07] <dalek> rakudo/ng: 9d5018c | (Solomon Foster)++ | src/core/Any-str.pm:

[17:08] <TimToady> asynchronicity++ too

[17:08] <mberends> fate, even

[17:09] <holli> speaking of it. is there builtin multicore support in Perl6?

[17:09] <TimToady> in the language, yes

[17:09] <holli> like a parallellize opeartor

[17:09] <colomon> holli: spec'd but not yet implemented

[17:10] <TimToady> rakudo: say 1,2,3 »+« 4,5,6

[17:10] <p6eval> rakudo 7f1c3f: 12756␤

[17:10] <TimToady> hmm, precedence failure

[17:10] <TimToady> rakudo: say (1,2,3) »+« (4,5,6)

[17:10] <p6eval> rakudo 7f1c3f: 579␤

[17:11] <TimToady> rakudo's parser still doesn't believe in list infixes, I guess

[17:11] <masak> TimToady: Rakudo has that one right, right?

[17:11] <masak> or not.

[17:11] <masak> I thought all hyperops had the same prec as their non-hyper counterparts.

[17:12] <masak> but perhaps that's just [] ops, not >> << ops.

[17:12] <TimToady> hmm, you may be right, lemme look

[17:12] <colomon> masak: seems to me like that would be the other way around?  

[17:12] <colomon> how can you stack [] ops?

[17:12] <masak> colomon: stack?

[17:12] <TimToady> rakudo: say 1,2,3 X 4,5,6

[17:12] <p6eval> rakudo 7f1c3f: 141516242526343536␤

[17:13] <TimToady> that one is right

[17:13] <colomon> masak: have more than one of them in an expression.

[17:13] <colomon> masak: in such a fashion that precedence would be an issue.

[17:13] <TimToady> so you're right, rakudo does know about list infix, but >>+<< isn't one

[17:13] <TimToady> (yet)

[17:14] <masak> colomon: [+] 1, 2, [*] 3, 4

[17:14] <masak> colomon: but no, precedence is not an issue there.

[17:14] <holli> what was the name again of this language with all this math symbols as operators? the one that was never widely used because there were no keyboards for it 

[17:14] <masak> it all falls out naturally, because they're listops.

[17:14] <colomon> whereas @a >>+<< @b >>*<< @c is perfectly sensible...

[17:14] <TimToady> colomon: actually, pugs did implement the multithreaded hypers at one point

[17:14] <masak> holli: APL?

[17:14] <masak> holli: and there were keyboards for it. :)

[17:15] <colomon> TimToady: really?  wonder if that still works?

[17:16] <TimToady> holli: also, we have feed operators ==> and <== that work like pipelines for cell architectures

[17:17] <TimToady> but those aren't implemented yet either

[17:17] * Juerd wonders if they'll be used much

[17:17] <holli> masak: yeah, that's it.

[17:17] <diakopter> programs get hungry

[17:18] <TimToady> but basically any lazy lists could be constructed by a separate processor, as long as there aren't bad dependencies (side effects)

[17:18] <masak> pipes are another place where I have the feeling that the spec will mutate a bit before settling...

[17:18] <mberends> masak: could you confirm that your OS X does *not* have /usr/include/malloc.h or /usr/local/include/malloc.h ?

[17:19] <colomon> mine has /usr/include/malloc/malloc.h

[17:19] <diakopter> /usr/include/sys/malloc.h

[17:20] <colomon> but neither one you mention.

[17:20] <mberends> ouch, that's the problem

[17:20] <colomon> and what diakopter says, too.

[17:20] <diakopter> but stdlib.h should cover it

[17:20] <mberends> ah, good suggestion

[17:21] <diakopter> otherwise, what colomon said

[17:24] <TimToady> holli: sure, but lazy lists have to keep ordering, even if calculated out of order; clouds tend to be better for map/reducey things

[17:24] <holli> the latter preferably

[17:24] <mberends> holli's head is in the clouds

[17:25] <diakopter> holli: ask again when they support RealPerl

[17:25] <holli> i think that will never happen.

[17:25] <diakopter> I mean, Perl 5... oops, did I leak the new name?

[17:25] <masak> "RealPerl"? is that the new nickname for Perl 5? :)

[17:26] <masak> strangely, I find myself amused rather than offended.

[17:26] <TimToady> as opposed to ComplexPerl? :)

[17:26] <diakopter> it was meant to amuse, so.. .whew

[17:58] <holli> so how do i read a directory in rakudo?

[17:58] <masak> you mean list all the files in it?

[17:58] <holli> for example

[17:58] <masak> I'd use something like qx{ ls } right now.

[17:59] <holli> iiek!

[18:00] <masak> 'ilek!'? was that an expression of approbation or distaste? :)

[18:00] <masak> can't keep up with the slang nowadays...

[18:00] <holli> more an expression of panic =)

[18:00] <masak> don't panic :)

[18:05] <holli> yeah, it's mostly harmless

[18:20] <masak> it got to linking this time...

[18:22] <mberends> ok, that's *very* different, not seen such before

[18:23] <mberends> and yet it looks like one detail causes all 151 lines

[18:24] <masak> that sounds like slightly good news...

[18:24] <mberends> the LLVM config is not pointing to a lib directory properly

[18:26] <mberends> that probably would need rebuilding LLVM with a different ./configure parameter

[18:27] <mberends> .oO( where would OS X C++ expect to find lib dirs? )

[18:28] <masak> no idea.

[18:28] <mberends> the --prefix option must be different for OS X

[18:28] <TimToady> I thought llvm didn't really support C++ yet...

[18:29] <mberends> TimToady: it *uses* C++, but is only partly compiling C++

[18:30] <mberends> their greatest achievement so far is a C compiler that adds -O4, optimization across linked code modules

[18:32] <masak> holli: there you go. if you hang around for half an hour or so, the rakudo evalbot will update, and you can have your method .eval :)

[18:34] <masak> and now, I need to go home and fill up on nutrients. running low on blood sugar...

[19:09] <TimToady> thanks...I think...

[19:09] <TimToady> I'll have to figure out someplace to put the couch, though...

[19:11] <subichan> TimToady: my proposal for perl6: multi tape finite state transducers

[19:12] <TimToady> I like the ^X^Cvi emacs command, myself  :P

[19:14] <subichan> it would be neat and you know it ;)

[19:14] * TimToady has a Pooh-brain that melts easily.

[19:15] <subichan> i know i may be late for proposals but i tried

[19:16] <subichan> it*

[19:16] <TimToady> in what way would this not be possible in a Perl 6 module?

[19:16] <holli> multi tape finite state transducer? sounds like a device from Star Trek (tm)

[19:18] <subichan> everything is possible, but somebody's gotta code it ! as a computational linguist i loved perl, but I longed a lot for two-tape transducers. had to resort to other toolkits for that. now that two-tape is kinda old and perl6 is coming out then i thought that would be a nice thing to add with its own operator or something..

[19:18] <subichan> .. as a multi-tape implementation

[19:19] <subichan> that's been done only with prolog afaik.

[19:22] *** rfordinal3643 left
[19:22] <subichan> perhaps i'm just being too lazy and egoistical

[19:25] <holli> i thought it's possible to invent your own operators in perl6.

[19:26] <subichan> yeah but i wanted it to be official.. you know, like s/// and tr//

[19:26] <colomon> holli: it certainly is possible.

[19:28] <holli> ahhh, good old hybris ;-D

[19:32] <holli> i'm just reading the wikipedia artictle about this tranducer thingie. my head aches.

[19:32] <holli> too much symbols.

[19:33] <TimToady> subichan: speaking of official, what's the official spelling of your name? 子美チャン、かなあ。。。

[19:34] <TimToady> or is it some other exotic language, like English?

[19:35] <holli> TimToady: you should have called this Mu object Poo. so one could say "everything comes down to poo"

[19:36] <Su-Shee> Mu is cool. I already hooked at least 3 japanologists on Perl 6 because of it. 

[19:37] <holli> .oO( writing perl6 code in kanji)

[19:38] <TimToady> hmm

[19:39] <subichan> it's a nickname lol so i wouldn't know how you should really spell it in japanese.. chan is the japanese suffix but the rest is really a nick.. so katakana i guess

[19:41] <TimToady> well, generally 'bi' comes out 美 'beauty' in names

[19:41] <TimToady> and 'su' could be any of various things

[20:35] <vamped> is there a preferential file suffix: .pl or .p6 ?

[20:37] <mberends> vamped: .pl because the contents determine 5 or 6

[20:37] <vamped> that's what I thought, but I'm getting my p5 and p6 code mixed up, so I thought maybe .p6

[20:38] <vamped> (until perl6 will run perl5 code)

[20:39] <mberends> use .p6 if you prefer, you'll just encounter minor friction occasionally

[20:39] <mberends> rename when the interoperability lands

[20:40] <vamped> well, maybe I had better conform to the one_true_way ;)

[20:40] <mberends> lots of files in Unix have no extension, and rely on #!/something

[20:41] <vamped> yes. that's another (GOOD) possibility. I think I will do it that way

[20:41] *** nihiliad joined

[20:49] <PerlJam> for me .pl is still either "prolog" or "perl library"  (ergo, I tend to use .p6 if I use anything at all)
