[01:15] <frettled> I just discovered that the REPL remembers previous declarations of subtypes, methods, and so on.

[01:17] <jnthn> frettled: In general, it remembers stuff that went into the lexpad, but not that went into the lexpad.

[03:13] <colomon> So, when I was talking with pmichaud the other day about working around the array calling bug, he talked about removing the Positional role check that is failing.

[03:13] <colomon> Any idea where that would be?

[03:13] <colomon> here's the issue:

[03:15] <diakopter> say sprintf?

[03:16] <diakopter> oh, you wanted the line breaks

[03:17] <lisppaste3> colomon pasted "maybe the error trace" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/92172

[03:18] <colomon> anyway, Tene, was wondering if you had any notion where the argument binding is happening.

[03:19] <colomon> I've been poking around binder/bind.c, but haven't figured out anything useful yet.

[03:22] <Tene> colomon: no, can't say that I can help here, sorry.

[03:26] <colomon> Hmmm... looks like maybe in Rakudo_binding_bind_one_param

[07:33] <moritz_> good morning

[07:35] <flip214> morning!

[07:35] <flip214> Are there any definitions about reduce() being serialized or not?

[07:36] <flip214> I'd like to use some variables for caching intermediate results ...

[07:36] <flip214> but if multiple threads could access them it might be a problem.

[07:37] <flip214> I don't know offhand whether reduce() can be used left-to-right, right-to-left and/or parallelized ... is there an option for that?

[07:38] <moritz_> it's left-to-right

[07:43] *** stepnem left
[07:43] <flip214> and serialized?

[07:48] <colomon> I'm kind of surprised there isn't a right-to-left adverb on reduce().

[07:49] <colomon> flip214: and serialized, yes.

[07:50] *** Woody2143 left
[07:51] <moritz_> flip214: what do you mean by "serialized"?

[07:51] *** Woody2143 joined
[07:55] *** JimmyZ left
[08:05] *** JimmyZ joined
[08:07] <moritz_> same as "sequential"?

[08:09] <colomon> that's how I took it, as distinct from "parallelized".

[08:11] *** vorner joined
[08:16] * moritz_ doesn't understand how a reduce could be left-to-right and still parallelized

[08:19] <flip214> yes - so that I can use a few tricks to speed up the calculation.

[08:20] <flip214> colomon: I'm surprised, too ... P6 should be better than Haskell and Lisp, shouldn't it?

[08:20] <flip214> moritz: parallelized was meant as a third alternative.

[08:21] <flip214> for [+] you can do parts of the array in parallel, and only combine the semi-results in the master thread.

[08:21] <moritz_> only if all multis of infix:<+> are associative

[08:21] <moritz_> which you generally can't know

[08:21] <flip214> maybe an operator could define whether it's parallizeable

[08:22] <flip214> yes, of course.

[08:22] <flip214> But if an operator could tell that by a trait or something like that ...

[08:23] <flip214> even [/] could be done in parallel, by .[0] / ([*] .[1..*])

[08:23] <flip214> (for normal arithmetic again)

[08:24] <moritz_> there's another problem

[08:24] <flip214> Sorry - not "an operator", but "a multi"

[08:24] <flip214> is there?

[08:24] <moritz_> if you do [+] @list, @list can be lazy

[08:24] <flip214> yes?

[08:24] <moritz_> and the number of elements would not be known in advance

[08:24] <flip214> yeS?

[08:24] <moritz_> so the optimizer doesn't have enough data to decide if it's worth parallelizing

[08:24] <flip214> so thread 1 does [1] + [5], thread 2 does [2]+[6], ...

[08:25] <moritz_> how does it even know there's a 5th and 6th item?

[08:25] <flip214> by doing clustered reads on the array? would help with cpu cache, too.

[08:25] *** iblechbot joined
[08:25] <flip214> first try to get some elements, and handle them in other threads ...

[08:26] <flip214> depends how long the element fetch takes, of course.

[08:26] <flip214> maybe the fetching takes much longer than the calculation

[08:26] <flip214> (eg reading from network etc.)

[08:27] <flip214> I think that if there's a way to tell reduce to try parallalizing it should be done only if the common case has many elements.

[08:27] <flip214> and so, if there are only a few elements, it won't take much time, too. (of course, some time gets wasted by thread creation/deletion etc.)

[08:27] <flip214> but if the common case is known (by profiling or whatever)

[08:28] <flip214> there's a good chance that this will improve performance.

[08:28] <flip214> especially as there will be more and more cpus in all computers ...

[08:28] <moritz_> it'll be interesting to see how lightweight or heavyweight threads will be

[08:30] <flip214> maybe some implementations might use a thread pool?

[08:52] <colomon> hello

[08:52] <moritz_> for some value of "home" :-)

[08:52] <surya> I m a perl fan

[08:53] *** ejs joined
[08:53] <moritz_> great

[08:53] <surya> just wanted to ask you great guys

[08:53] <moritz_> welcome to the wonderful world of Perl 6

[08:53] <surya> wht kind of development actiity is going on

[08:53] <surya> *activity 

[08:53] <surya> and hw can I contribute ?

[08:54] <moritz_> well, a lot of things are being developed: the language specification, the test suite, compilers, modules, documentation, a book, module installer...

[08:54] <moritz_> surya: what kind of work would you like to do?

[08:54] <moritz_> and in which programming languages?

[08:55] <surya> I have workex in perl 5.8 - perl 5.10

[08:55] <surya> PHP 5 and Java

[08:55] <surya> plus I do a lot of DB level things

[08:55] *** pointme left
[08:56] <moritz_> there's a project going on that might interest you

[08:56] <moritz_> two, actually

[08:56] <surya> all these devlopment activities are intimating 

[08:56] <moritz_> Squerl is a kind of ORM-wrapper (in Perl 6) around sqlite: http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39686

[08:57] <surya> let me quickly go through tht

[08:57] <moritz_> and Tim Bunce is working on DBDI, something similar to DBI on the parrot level

[08:57] *** masak joined
[08:57] <moritz_> but maybe for starters it's easiest to write a small, pure-perl module to get used to Perl 6

[08:58] <surya> hmmm

[08:58] <masak> I just got here, but I agree. :)

[08:58] <masak> better to start small.

[08:58] <moritz_> surya: masak is the guy behind squerl, so if you have any questions about it...

[08:58] <masak> in particular, make sure you have a really tight code-run-code cycle.

[08:58] *** mathw joined
[08:58] <surya> thanks for tht insight 

[08:58] <masak> Rakudo is so slow, so one needs to compensate by testing often.

[08:59] <surya> let me check with masak 

[08:59] <masak> it's like it induces a TDD style. :)

[08:59] *** Woodi left
[08:59] * masak backlogs

[09:01] <surya> wht kind of code are you writing 

[09:01] <surya> so masak

[09:01] <masak> surya: I try to write everything I can think of. :)

[09:01] <masak> partly to learn, partly to exercise Rakudo.

[09:02] <surya> :-)

[09:02] <surya> so for a beginner like me wht wud u suggest ?

[09:02] *** Woodi joined
[09:02] <masak> surya: find something that interests you; do that.

[09:03] <masak> I could be more specific. we do need hands here and there.

[09:03] <surya> hmm 

[09:03] <moritz_> start reading about Perl 6, and play with it while you read

[09:03] <masak> yes, that.

[09:03] <surya> so is thr a location whr we have wish list or something similar ?

[09:03] *** ejs1 joined
[09:03] <eiro> hello guys 

[09:03] <mathw> Finding something you're interested in will be far more successful in the long term

[09:03] <masak> eiro: \o

[09:03] <surya> :-)

[09:03] <vorner> surya: I tried to write maildir parser, but it turned out it needs to get faster and lazy for it to be of practical use.

[09:04] <vorner> However, it was just few lines of code, which is kind of nice.

[09:04] <masak> many things are blocking on speed, and stability.

[09:04] <masak> but it's still fun to push the limits as they recede. :)

[09:04] <surya> nice

[09:04] <surya> maildir

[09:05] <surya> let me read abt tht

[09:05] <mathw> I wrote a maildir parser in Haskell once

[09:05] <mathw> That was fun

[09:05] <mathw> It was to feed messages through crm114 to teach it about spam and ham, and doing it in Perl seemed too obvious

[09:07] <vorner> Anyway, for my needs, I will probably need to write it in C to be fast and lightweight enough (or rakudo would have to get better really a lot)

[09:07] <mathw> Maybe in a year or two

[09:07] <surya> hmm

[09:07] <surya> so wht if I hv to write examples fr audience 

[09:08] <vorner> mathw: is it expected to get like 10 times faster than perl5?

[09:08] <surya> cos I find example based documentation is also very important 

[09:08] <surya> yeah c is very fast

[09:08] <surya> but I m nt a c guy

[09:08] <surya> c, looks like out of world to me :-D

[09:08] <moritz_> surya: http://github.com/perl6/book/ is an attempt to write a Perl 6 book with lots of useful examples

[09:09] <surya> lil no no I m quite fast in c till the time u ask me to wrtite hello world program

[09:09] <mathw> vorner: hmm, that might be asking a bit much

[09:09] <surya> :-)

[09:09] <mathw> masak: nice advent :)

[09:10] <masak> mathw: ta :)

[09:10] <mathw> I hadn't realised I mentioned smartmatching before anybody actually explained it

[09:10] <vorner> mathw: Yes, I know. Perl is nice (and getting nicer every version), but it is not really ment for powerfull and fast computations.

[09:10] <mathw> This is the problem with writing tutorial material

[09:10] <mathw> vorner: A friend of mine uses it a lot for that, but he cheats - he drives the thing from Perl, but does the heavy maths in C libraries he binds with XS

[09:11] <mathw> Which gives him a nice balance between ease of sticking bits together, and speed of computation

[09:12] *** ejs left
[09:12] <Su-Shee> POGL has some interesting opengl benchmarks where parts of the perl-c-mix are even faster than pure c. 

[09:12] <moritz_> masak: ($c,$d)=$c min$d,$c max$d; looks like a candidate for minmax, no?

[09:12] <wayland76> Really?  Cool :)

[09:12] <moritz_> rakudo: say (2 minmax 4).perl

[09:12] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: No applicable candidates found to dispatch to for 'infix:minmax'␤in Main (file <unknown>, line <unknown>)␤

[09:12] <flip214> vorner: I still have the hope that with perl6 -> parrot -> llcm -> C code -> c compiler there's a chance to get nearly to C

[09:12] <moritz_> ouch

[09:12] <moritz_> or sort

[09:13] <moritz_> ($c,$d)=sort($c,d)

[09:13] <masak> moritz_: by the way, Squerl isn't specific to sqlite... it's just that we haven't gotten around to adding in mySQL.

[09:13] <flip214> And if everything else fails, maybe just rewriting a few parts in C should be enough

[09:13] <mathw> flip214: I think Parrot could get really fast, but it's going to take a while before they get near that point

[09:13] <vorner> flip214: would be really nice, I guess

[09:13] <moritz_> rakudo: my ($c, $d) = 4, 3; ($c, $d).=sort; say $c

[09:14] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: 3␤

[09:14] <moritz_> rakudo: my ($c, $d) = 4, 3; ($c, $d).=sort; say ~($c, $d)

[09:14] <masak> rakudo: my ($c, $d) = sort(4, 3); say $c

[09:14] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: 3 4␤

[09:14] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: 3␤

[09:14] <moritz_> I think ($c, $d).=sort is cheating :-)

[09:14] <moritz_> but I'm not sure

[09:14] <masak> moritz_: do you think I should change the program in the blog post?

[09:14] <moritz_> TimToady: should it work?

[09:15] <moritz_> masak: I find sort nicer, but it's your call really

[09:15] <masak> moritz_: I'll do it :)

[09:15] <flip214> Well, as I said ... if there's an easy way to interface with C (eg. by storing objects as a C structure), a few pieces can always be optimized.

[09:15] <masak> I kinda guessed mine wasn't the shortest possible variant.

[09:15] <flip214> And AFAIK it's only a *very* small part of code that has to be really optimized.

[09:16] <moritz_> speaking of the advent... is there a way to turn off the "possibly related posts" section?

[09:16] <moritz_> it's kinda distracting, and has very bad matches most of the time

[09:18] <masak> moritz_: you keep asking questions about Wordpress which are really Google queries! http://en.support.wordpress.com/related-posts/

[09:19] <masak> (and yes, you may definitely turn them off.)

[09:20] <vorner> Well, the program I needed was mostly only the parsing. And when I need it to run fast, then there is no much motivation to go by the trouble of having perl-C together.

[09:26] <masak> surya: I can tell you a bit more about my interests: I like to write small apps that do new things. in doing so, I like to find new bugs and report them. I sometimes make commits to Rakudo. and I blog about stuff.

[09:26] <surya> Okk

[09:26] <surya> so all the code u write is in c?

[09:27] * moritz_ writes tests for the test suite, chapters for the book, rakudo patches and sometimes I enhance my plotting library in Perl 6

[09:27] <moritz_> all that is either Perl 6 or English

[09:27] <moritz_> (with few exceptions)

[09:28] <masak> oh, forgot about the book. :)

[09:28] <masak> surya: no, it's mostly Perl 6, like moritz_++ said.

[09:29] <surya> Okk got it

[09:29] <surya> so I shud start with test cases 

[09:29] <surya> ?

[09:29] <masak> surya: sometimes it's Perl 5, too. it's funny, these past two years have given me a great respect for the capabilities of Perl 5.

[09:29] <surya> whts ur suggestion ?

[09:29] <masak> surya: test cases for an app you want to write? yes, sure!

[09:29] <masak> that's a good idea.

[09:29] <Su-Shee> "use vocals" ;)

[09:30] <surya> cool

[09:31] <surya> does GIT has the documentation etc

[09:31] <moritz_> BTW the google webmaster tool says the perl6advent feed has 260 subscribers via google

[09:31] <vorner> surya: Me? No, my hobby is to know as many languages as possible, so I write in what comes at hand usually. But there are reasons for C sometimes.

[09:32] <surya> masak: Okk

[09:32] <mathw> moritz_: nice :)

[09:32] <masak> surya: git has plenty of documentation. my favorite introduction is called 'git from the bottom up'/

[09:32] <surya> cool

[10:05] <frettled> now I have!

[10:06] <moritz_> you can blame the ironman competition. Without it I would have published the post straight away

[10:06] <wayland76> Sure it's from May, but I figured it might be useful to those designing P6 modules that they intend to release someday

[10:06] <frettled> It might have been from 1990.

[10:07] <frettled> (because, among other things, he's not mentioning test-driven development)

[10:07] <moritz_> wayland76: I've seen the Tech Talk it's referring to, and was positively surprised how well the RFCs and exegeses fit the criteria

[10:08] <wayland76> Yes, and some of his stuff sounds like he's vaguely groping towards aglie programming concepts

[10:08] <moritz_> frettled: well, the "write examples first" is kinda like TDD in intent

[10:08] <JimmyZ> with Parrot-1.9.0 & mingw, cannot build Rakudo (master)

[10:08] <RichiH> frettled: yah, i wondered where "test, test, test" was in the post :)

[10:08] <wayland76> s/aglie/agile/ -- the other sounds like it's ugly :)

[10:08] <RichiH> moritz_: use case != test

[10:09] <moritz_> RichiH: right. But writing tests cases for an API that's not implemented yet isn't more useful than writing examples

[10:10] <moritz_> at least not for the API designer

[10:10] <RichiH> moritz_: not at first, but you can track progress by seeing how fewer and fewer tests fail

[10:11] <moritz_> RichiH: when you *implement* it. Sure. But that's not what the talk is about

[10:11] <moritz_> and yes, I know how valuable tests are for implementations. Which is why I commit to the Perl 6 test suite, occasionally

[10:11] *** agentzh left
[10:12] <masak> moritz_++ # if only more people did it with the frequency you call 'occasionally' :)

[10:12] <RichiH> moritz_: i still think it should have been mentioned. especially as a single sentence like 'use those use cases to design tests and run them!' would have fit into it, imo

[10:15] *** lestrrat is now known as lest_away

[10:17] <frettled> moritz_: It's not "a talk", it's a web page trying to sum up what's needed for good API design.

[10:17] <frettled> moritz_: that there incidentally is a talk in there, is because he's trying to provide links to his sources :)

[10:18] <moritz_> and I've seen that talk which he uses as a source

[10:18] <moritz_> that's what I wanted to say

[10:18] <frettled> as one of his sources :)

[10:20] <frettled> But sure, you need to know what you're going to _use_ your API for.

[10:20] <frettled> That's why I said it could have been written in 1990.

[10:20] *** pmurias joined

[10:32] <frettled> moritz_: I don't care about «agile» per se.

[10:32] <moritz_> masak++

[10:33] <frettled> moritz_: But I believe that testing is such a fundamental part of API design that neglecting to mention it on a web page that attempts to collect information and references for good API design would be criminal, if anything in programming was.

[10:34] <wayland76> IMHO, the web page looks more like some notes thrown together than a carefully compiled compendium

[10:35] <frettled> Yep.

[10:35] <wayland76> I'm not saying it's wonderful, but ... maybe someone could do better :)  Or something :)

[10:35] <frettled> But I'm projecting negativity here, so I'll stop.  Instead, I'll ask for help :)

[10:35] <Su-Shee> are you really complaining that someone did left out to mention testing (which everybody obviously alread knows) in a blog posting? :)

[10:37] <moritz_> Su-Shee: does yours?

[10:38] <Su-Shee> no, that's my point. 

[10:39] <Su-Shee> I actually have yet to see the company - my jobs or friends - which actually _does_ programming that nicely and well organized. ;) 

[10:40] <Su-Shee> though we have human testers which actually do the stuff you didn't think of anyone would ever do. ;)

[10:42] <frettled> m-hm

[10:42] <frettled> There's almost no test-driven code at $orkplace.

[10:42] <moritz_> so writing tests would destroy their jobs :/

[10:42] <frettled> haha

[10:42] <frettled> Their jobs are already meaningless!  ;)

[10:42] <moritz_> why? the improve the quality of the product

[10:43] <moritz_> s/the/they/

[10:43] <Su-Shee> no. human testers and written tests test totally different things. 

[10:43] <Su-Shee> in 99% of all companies I know, the schedule usally kills writing tests first. 

[10:44] <moritz_> and then the unwritten tests kill the schedule, by letting regressions slip in

[10:45] <wayland76> Have you tried adopting the "User Stories" from "eXtreme Programming"?

[10:45] <Su-Shee> no, the schedule kills the schedule. ;) and developers have usally a very optimistic view on their use of time.

[10:45] <moritz_> Su-Shee: yes.

[10:50] <Su-Shee> wayland76: I've never seen a company actually getting to something which resembles any by-the-book-concept of project management. 

[10:51] <wayland76> Su-Shee: Maybe not, but that doesn't mean that it isn't worth giving things a go

[10:52] <mathw> Where I work, we do a fairly literal version of scrum

[10:52] <mathw> It actually works... most of the time

[10:52] <mathw> A lot depends on what you put into it, of course

[10:53] <lisppaste3> frettled pasted "What am I doing wrong?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/92184

[10:55] <moritz_> is_success ($_, $target)

[10:55] <moritz_> remove that space

[10:55] <moritz_> you're passing a list of $_, $target as the first positional argumet to is_success

[10:58] <frettled> Argh, typical!

[10:58] <frettled> Thanks.

[10:59] <frettled> Hmm, no, that doesn't solve it.

[11:00] <frettled> It fails before then, it fails at the type check for sub roll.

[11:01] <moritz_> say roll @*ARGS[0].Int, @*ARGS[1].Int }

[11:02] <moritz_> but you declared the second parameter to be named

[11:02] <moritz_> when 1|2 { say roll |@*ARGS>>.Int }

[11:03] <moritz_> if you declare it as an optional positional parameter

[11:03] <moritz_> but it doesn't exactly explain the error

[11:03] <frettled> Mm, that's what I wanted, I wonder where that colon came from.

[11:04] <moritz_> colomon is our colon specialist :-) *SCNR*

[11:04] <moritz_> (actually masak++ is)

[11:05] <masak> It's the third law of Perl 6: masak dislikes the colon. :P

[11:05] <frettled> Now it's working.

[11:05] <masak> at least I don't think it should be over-used.

[11:05] <moritz_> masak: why do you dislike it?

[11:05] <masak> moritz_: two reasons, both quite weak.

[11:05] <moritz_> masak: looking at your code it seems you use it quite frequently

[11:05] <masak> O RLY? :)

[11:06] <frettled> The problem with rewriting code for a paste is that I sometimes lose things or add things involuntarily, hehe

[11:06] <frettled> Okay, this will become a blog post tonight, I think.  :)

[11:06] <moritz_> masak: at least in the code you blog

[11:06] <frettled> moritz_++ - you helped me nail it.

[11:06] <moritz_> frettled: there's a good reason to use version control even for simple things

[11:06] <masak> moritz_: (1) I've once spent half an hour looking for a bug which turned out to be due to precedence problems involving the colon form of method invocation.

[11:06] <frettled> moritz_: yeah, but I'm using copy+paste via a buggy copy+paste implementation

[11:07] <frettled> Snow Leopard broke copy+paste between X11 and other apps.

[11:07] <frettled> So I created a FIFO to paste from X11 to X11, then jump over to a Terminal.app and copy+paste out from there.  But sometimes, the FIFO loses things, or I lose things when selecting for paste.

[11:08] <masak> moritz_: (2) colons exist in so many forms that they initially confuse newcomers. I experienced that first-hand in szabgab++'s class before YAPC::EU. I found myself saying "No, that's not an adverb colon, that's a method invocation colon". people groaned from pain.

[11:08] <frettled> I really need to get cracking on using a remote repository for this.

[11:08] <moritz_> sounds like 21st century technology :-)

[11:08] <moritz_> (to frettled)

[11:08] <moritz_> masak: hm, interesting

[11:08] <frettled> :D

[11:08] *** vorner left
[11:08] <masak> frettled: for some reason, copy+pasting via Emacs always works for me.

[11:09] <frettled> Next challenge for me: create a dice roller for the L5R system.

[11:09] <frettled> masak: in this case, the code is on a remote computer which I access through SSH and screen within screen.  There, it's running in Emacs.

[11:09] <frettled> Oooh, luncheon!

[11:09] * frettled frettles and idles.

[11:11] <masak> frettled: oh.

[11:20] <masak> moritz_: oh! I _do_ like the named-parameter colons.

[11:20] <masak> I especially like that :$foo is a short form of :foo($foo)

[11:20] <mathw> everyone wants the colon

[11:21] <masak> and that it ignores twigils.

[12:06] <frettled> Do we use '·' yet?  :)

[12:11] <wayland76> Probably not; there aren't that many unicode operators as part of the Perl core

[12:15] <masak> can I refer to the private attribute of a role through the private-attribute syntax? self!SomeRole::attr

[12:17] <jnthn> masak: Depends what you mean by "private attribute of a role"

[12:18] <jnthn> If you mean that you had a role Foo { has $!attr }

[12:18] <masak> jnthn: role Austria { has $!attr }

[12:18] <masak> yes.

[12:18] <jnthn> Yeah

[12:18] <jnthn> but composition is flattening.

[12:18] <jnthn> So you'd just use the name of the class you composed the role into there.

[12:18] <masak> ah.

[12:18] <masak> makes sense.

[12:18] <jnthn> After composition, the only relation between a class and a role is that the class knows it does that role.

[12:19] <masak> rakudo: class A { has $!b is readonly = "foo" }; A.new

[12:19] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d:  ( no output )

[12:19] <masak> locally, "No applicable candidates found to dispatch to for 'trait_mod:is'"

[12:19] <masak> should that work?

[12:19] <jnthn> We probably allow $foo.Role::Method but mostly because methods make sense alone whereas attributes just refer to slots...

[12:19] <jnthn> masak: Probably...

[12:20] * masak submits rakudobug

[12:20] <masak> at least the warning is LTA-ly suspicious.

[12:21] <jnthn> Well, it's not far off the mark.

[12:21] <masak> it makes it sound as if 'is readonly' is not implemented...

[12:22] <jnthn> Right, which in that case it evidently isn't. :-)

[12:23] <masak> so, to summarize: the bug is that 'is readonly' isn't implemented.

[12:23] <masak> we also don't really know whether it should work, semantically, to assign to a readonly variable during object construction.

[12:23] * masak notices he is talking to his RT tickets again

[12:24] <masak> "no, dearie, we can't close you yet. your observable isn't satisfied, see."

[12:29] <wayland76> But at least you can tell it which packages to force, and at what stages; at least enough for my needs :)

[12:30] <BinGOs> modifications where? are they useful upstream?

[12:30] * wayland76 wonders how difficult it would be to get these things incorporated into the module :)

[12:30] <jnthn> masak: Yes, that is a good question.

[12:30] *** zibri left
[12:30] <jnthn> masak: the other disconnect is that in has $.x is readonly you'd expect it to be about the generated accessor, not the actual attribute.

[12:30] *** zibri_ is now known as zibri

[12:31] <masak> jnthn: I've gotten used to that one.

[12:31] <BinGOs> wayland76: it is feature updates my hands are tied at the moment

[12:31] <BinGOs> though they could go into 0.92

[12:32] <BinGOs> I'm working on shipping 0.90 of CPANPLUS some time in the next couple of days.

[12:32] <BinGOs> maybe even today.

[12:32] <wayland76> Ok :)

[12:32] <wayland76> Is there an IRC channel for CPANPLUS?

[12:32] <jnthn> masak: yeah, same

[12:33] <masak> oh! does the 'when' clause, when it matches, call infix:<~~>, or the .ACCEPTS method on the expression?

[12:33] <frettled> #CPANPLUS?

[12:33] <BinGOs> not as such, but #toolchain on irc.perl.org is a catch-all for perl5 toolchain related matters.

[12:33] <wayland76> frettled: Yeah, but on which network?

[12:33] <jnthn> masak: iirc, ~~

[12:33] <moritz_> masak: first of all smart match is partially syntactic

[12:33] <BinGOs> CPAN/CPANPLUS are considered toolchain.

[12:33] <jnthn> masak: but it also applies same syntactic cases

[12:34] <wayland76> BinGOs: will continue conversation there :)

[12:34] <masak> I'm asking because I'm trying to think of something sensible to answer to the question "For overloading smart matching, am I right in assuming is just a plain ol’ `multi sub infix:<~~>`?"

[12:34] <masak> ...on my advent blog post.

[12:34] <masak> I want to involve .ACCEPTS in the answer, but only if it actually matters.

[12:35] <moritz_> overloading infix:<~~> is plain wrong

[12:35] <frettled> wayland76: wherever you want it to be :)

[12:35] <moritz_> because it's not a multi, and because of the syntactic cases

[12:35] <moritz_> which makes it more of a macro

[12:35] <masak> ok.

[12:36] <moritz_> so writing an ACCEPTS method for the object on the RHS is "the right thing"

[12:36] <frettled> ooh, I'd like to see the code for that

[12:36] <frettled> (and answers to the questions to Dec. 12)

[12:50] <colomon> before my time.  :)

[12:50] <masak> be glad :)

[12:50] <moritz_> it made pmichaud and others basically rewrite the system how lexicals are handled in parrot

[13:03] <moritz_> seeing a "fixed in r\d+" in comments of #58392 is somehow odd. To remember that Rakudo once lived in the parrot repo...

[13:03] <masak> that's pretty much exactly one ticket a day on average.

[14:17] <Juerd_> Thanks, TimToady 

[14:17] <Juerd_> I couldn't remember if there was an opposite for "not"

[14:17] <Juerd_> English doesn't have one. Dutch does.

[14:17] <Juerd_> And apparently so does Perl 6

[14:18] <moritz_> it's called "really?" in English

[14:18] <Juerd_> Maybe I should alias "true" to the dutch word "wel" in my local version of Perl 6 :)

[14:19] <TimToady> we also have "so"

[14:19] <Juerd_> "so" is not a true opposite.

[14:19] <TimToady> is so

[14:19] <Juerd_> Heh.

[14:19] <Juerd_> Then why is true not called so? :)

[14:20] <moritz_> Su-Shee: "doch" is only a valid answer to negated questions, really

[14:21] <frettled> I'd have likd to have the above code without the «'',», but I can do that by negating the test, I suppose.

[14:21] <frettled> rakudo: sub whine ($n) { say (' - My goodness!')[$n < 5] }; whine(4); whine(5);

[14:21] <frettled> d'oh.

[14:22] <Juerd_> The Dutch "wel" is used in answering negative questions, but can also be used without such context.

[14:22] <masak> I thought >= didn't have a negated variant.

[14:24] <Juerd_> Why is !~~ not !~, and !~~ a true negated ~~?

[14:24] <PerlJam> that's a weird message.

[14:25] <moritz_> Juerd_: because all other operators are negated by prepending a !, and != is just kept for backwards compatiblity

[14:25] <moritz_> but !== is still allowed

[14:25] <masak> Juerd_: maybe we could use !not :)

[14:25] <Juerd_> moritz_: !~~ isn't a true negation, though.

[14:25] <TimToady> Juerd_: how so?

[14:25] <PerlJam> moritz_: and why are we worried about backward compatibility for !=   ?   :)

[14:25] <moritz_> std: say 1 !ne 2

[14:25] <p6eval> std 29346: ok 00:01 105m␤

[14:25] <Juerd_> moritz_: foo !~~ bar can be different than !(foo ~~ bar) if I understood correctly.

[14:26] <moritz_> Juerd_: right

[14:26] <moritz_> TimToady: because it calls .REJCECTS, and not !.ACCEPTS

[14:26] <moritz_> iirc

[14:26] <masak> nod.

[14:26] <masak> that's what .REJECTS is for.

[14:26] <TimToady> maybe it's time to get rid of .REJECTS then

[14:26] <moritz_> TimToady: agreed

[14:27] <masak> yes, unless someone comes up with a real good use case.

[14:27] <Juerd_> Why not make lhs !op rhs the same as !(lhs op rhs) all over the place, and add an exception for !~, just like != is an exception to the !op rule.

[14:27] <moritz_> it's counter-intuitive and mostly redundant

[14:27] <TimToady> it seems completely redundant to me

[14:27] <masak> come to think of it, I've never seen someone make a good use of REJECTS.

[14:27] *** rjbs joined
[14:27] <Juerd_> Heh

[14:27] <PerlJam> Juerd_: I would prefer to git rid of the exceptions rather than add a new one.

[14:28] <rjbs> First off, your Advent calendar rocks.  It really is making me spend more time playing in the REPL.

[14:28] <rjbs> Secondly, how do I convert a range into an array?

[14:28] <Juerd_> PerlJam: I'm not adding a new one. I'm renaming the existing one, and adding a non-exception in its old place)

[14:29] <rjbs> I had tried with lc array :)

[14:29] <masak> rjbs: I'd use .list, unless you plan to modify it.

[14:30] <moritz_> type conversions are just method calls with the same name as the target type

[14:30] <rjbs> great

[14:30] <masak> oh, I wish that were true across the board!

[14:31] <masak> rjbs: the repl is going away to be replaced by a better one.

[14:31] <masak> rjbs: it would be nice if it remembered variables, too. :(

[14:32] <rjbs> yeah, I figure I've whined about that one enough in the past :)

[14:32] <rjbs> (and each time heard, "we know, it'll be fixed," and I believey ou)

[14:32] <masak> one can never whine enough about that...

[14:32] <moritz_> rjbs: it's good to keep on whining

[14:32] <rjbs> Well, until I'm paying closer attention I try not to be the guy who shows up every X period to ask the same question.

[14:32] *** pmurias joined

[14:33] <masak> lucky you. :)

[14:34] <pmichaud> I have the pieces in place for the better repl.  :)

[14:34] <rjbs> like, I only play in the repl, so I don't write classes, etc.

[14:34] <pmichaud> (did that part in my grant)

[14:34] <rjbs> the first thing I'll bitch about next will be the ability to install libraries to @INC

[14:34] <masak> rjbs: classes work surprisingly well. jnthn++

[14:34] <rjbs> and then my plan is to port Rx schema to p6, which will probably teach me a lot and give me things to whine about

[14:34] <masak> rjbs: that's on its way.

[14:35] <rjbs> yeah, I've seen some posts; I've really wanted to contribute to the discussion, but ENOTUITS

[14:35] <moritz_> rjbs: actually the @*INC situation as slightly improved

[14:35] <moritz_> it incorporates ~/.perl6/lib/ and . by default

[14:35] <moritz_> and you can always BEGIN { @*INC.push: 'path' }

[14:36] <PerlJam> If only we had macros ...

[14:36] <rjbs> I want: cd Module ; make isntall

[14:36] <rjbs> basically

[14:37] <moritz_> if 'make install' copies Module.pm to ~/.perl6/lib/ that works

[14:37] <moritz_> rakudo: say @*INC.perl

[14:37] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: ["/home/p6eval/.perl6/lib", "/home/p6eval//p1/lib/parrot/1.8.0-devel/languages/perl6/lib", "lib", "."]␤

[14:37] <moritz_> the "lib" comes from the PERL6LIB env variable which p6eval sets

[14:39] <rjbs> Well, like I said, I will wait until then to start complaining in earnest.

[14:40] <pmichaud> rjbs: hopefully you could complain just a bit before we release Rakudo * ?  ;-)

[14:40] <pmichaud> i.e., find some tuits to do so?

[14:40] <pmichaud> we should have the repl issues fixed by jan release

[14:40] <TimToady> lovely word, "should"

[14:41] <pmichaud> indeed.  :)

[14:41] <pmichaud> but now that I know that repl is a blocker for rjbs, it'll get a bump in priority

[14:41] <TimToady> I *should* be getting ready to drive to Seatlle today, sigh...

[14:41] <TimToady> backlogging is more fun though

[14:42] <pmichaud> alas, sometimes "should"  !==   "-Ofun"

[14:42] <PerlJam> pmichaud: when should ng land?  ;)

[14:42] <pmichaud> but darn it, it *should* be.

[14:42] <TimToady> at least it *should* should

[14:42] <rjbs> pmichaud: I will try to.  I am a bear of very little memory, so if you poke me at any time I will always make time to look at things.

[15:11] <colomon> ng's version of Rat.Rat, coming right up....

[15:11] <PerlJam> colomon++

[15:11] <JimmyZ> ng: 3.14.perl.say

[15:11] <p6eval> ng 8a7d1c: 157/50␤

[15:11] <colomon> woah, my ng is failing spectests left and right.

[15:11] <JimmyZ> colomon: It's a bug?

[15:11] <colomon> JimmyZ: 1.1.Rat.say should definitely work.

[15:11] <colomon> Annoying... it's trivial to implement, and I've already got it done, but no idea how long it will take me to sort out the spectest fails which are probably completely unrelated....

[15:11] <colomon> t/01-sanity/12-try.t fails..

[15:13] <colomon> t/spec/S02-builtin_data_types/parsing-bool.t fails

[15:13] *** JimmyZ left
[15:13] <colomon> Method 'perl' not found for invocant of class 'Undef'

[15:14] *** ejs1 left
[15:14] <colomon> I'm going to push my patch anyway, on the theory that it can't possibly be wrong.  :)

[15:16] <colomon> I think try may be broken.

[15:16] *** FalseVinylShrub joined
[15:16] <colomon> Either that or try is now right and a whole bunch of other things are broken because of it.

[15:17] <dalek> rakudo/ng: 0e4560e | (Solomon Foster)++ | src/core/Rat.pm:

[15:17] <dalek> rakudo/ng: Add Rat.Rat.

[15:17] <dalek> rakudo/ng: review: http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/0e4560ee31cc5f1673ea5c4a06a4bee98d5ba1e0

[15:17] <moritz_> both seem quite possible

[15:17] <moritz_> ng: say 1 === 1

[15:17] <p6eval> ng 8a7d1c: sh: ./perl6: No such file or directory␤

[15:17] <moritz_> meh

[15:18] <colomon> Tene patched try overnight, I should add.

[15:18] *** FalseVinylShrub left
[15:18] <moritz_> ng: say 1 === 1

[15:18] <p6eval> ng 8a7d1c: sh: ./perl6: No such file or directory␤

[15:18] *** FalseVinylShrub joined
[15:18] <moritz_> I think he changed it not to catch control exceptions

[15:18] <hejki> hmm.. can i pass ARGS to rakudo?

[15:18] <hejki> on the evalbot? :)

[15:19] <moritz_> hejki: no

[15:19] <hejki> ok

[15:19] <moritz_> ng: say 1 === 1

[15:19] <p6eval> ng 0e4560: 1␤

[15:19] <moritz_> ng: say 1/1 === 1/1

[15:19] <p6eval> ng 0e4560: 0␤

[15:19] <moritz_> that's wrong

[15:19] <moritz_> since Rat is a value type

[15:19] *** pmurias joined
[15:20] <hejki> can i paste 2 lines?

[15:20] <moritz_> sure

[15:20] <hejki> [ hejki@cornix ~/ohjelmointi/perl6] $ perl6 -e 'sub MAIN ($a, :$var) { say "a: $a, b: $var"; }' jarmo --var

[15:20] <hejki> Too many positional parameters passed; got 2 but expected 1

[15:20] <hejki> :o

[15:20] <hejki> shouldn't that use $var as optional param? :)

[15:21] <moritz_> I could well imagine that only positional parameters work for MAIN

[15:21] <pmichaud> we don't have option processing completely implemented yet

[15:21] <moritz_> hejki: please submit that as a bug report to [email@hidden.address]
[15:22] <hejki> moritz_: sec, i'll pull first and see if it's reproducible

[15:22] <moritz_> I'm quite sure nothing changed recently re MAIN

[15:23] *** colomon left
[15:23] *** colomon joined
[15:24] <hejki> moritz_: do you use some template or is it freeform? :)

[15:24] <moritz_> hejki: freeform

[15:25] <moritz_> just include the small snippet, two lines wy it's wrong, and your Rakudo version

[15:25] <hejki> okies

[17:33] <diakopter> colomon: yeah

[17:36] * diakopter watches (with interest) the fireworks in #parrot  I wish someone would see the implications of the results of all of my C#/mono ports of parrot/examples/benchmarks/*.pasm (and *.pir) - the results were that mono does them all 10-20 (and in some cases 100)x faster.

[17:38] <diakopter> heck, a couple of the (further irreducible) .pasm and .pir versions are 5-10x *slower* than Perl 5

[17:41] <diakopter> all: ^^ I am not making this up.

[17:41] <moritz_> diakopter: that still doesn't mean that a dynamic language implemented on top of mono is faster

[17:41] *** jferrero left
[17:42] <moritz_> for example fib.pir doesn't exploit a single feature that you need for dynamic languages

[17:42] <diakopter> moritz_: I agree, but that would imply that there is some crucial aspect that's not tested in parrot/example/benchmarks

[17:43] <moritz_> diakopter: that I agree with

[17:43] *** cdarroch joined
[17:44] <colomon> Any idea how much of the slowness is just memory allocation?

[17:45] <colomon> I've never worked with parrot directly, but it sure seems like Rakudo is an amazing memory hog.

[17:45] <moritz_> it sure is :/

[17:45] <moritz_> colomon: maybe 40% is garbage collection

[17:46] <diakopter> moritz_: any idea how to write some microbenchmarks that might test the [combinations of] the primitive operations used in dynamic languages?

[17:47] <Tene> moritz_: Yes, I changed try {} to not catch control exceptions, as Coke++ pointed out it's specced.  I didn't actually look at the spectests, as I'm still a bit confused about what tests ng should be running or not.  Is this an error?

[17:47] <moritz_> Tene: ng's "make test" and "make specteest" should both be clean

[17:47] <Tene> Oh.  That's helpful.

[17:47] <moritz_> make spectest only runs a reduced set that should all pass

[17:48] <moritz_> (though didn't quite, last I looked)

[17:48] <moritz_> it might be worth looking into Test.pm, maybe that depends on the old try { } behaviour

[17:49] <Tene> oh, maybe it's not returning the result of the block anymore...

[17:49] *** alester joined
[17:50] <Tene> Well, lemme see what actually fails.

[17:50] <colomon> the problems I saw were tests that actually used try directly.

[17:50] <Tene> I've only got a couple of minutes to look at it before going to work, though.

[17:50] <colomon> but I didn't look in too much detail.

[17:50] <Tene> colomon: can you point one out to me please?

[17:51] <diakopter> moritz_: were you thinking vtables and PIC and such?

[17:51] <moritz_> diakopter: no

[17:51] <colomon> Tene: t/spec/S02-builtin_data_types/parsing-bool.t

[17:51] <moritz_> well, maybe vtables

[17:52] <diakopter> I'd be glad to put some time into such microbenchmarks...

[17:52] <moritz_> operations that have to be dispatched at run time

[17:52] <moritz_> where the equivalent in mono can't optimize based on types

[17:52] <diakopter> ok, run time type-checking and type-dispatching

[17:53] <moritz_> Tene: t/01-sanity/12-try.t

[17:53] <moritz_> try { die };

[17:53] <moritz_> dies

[17:54] <Tene> Heh.  That throws a CONTROL_ERROR exception.

[17:54] <Tene> Which is a CONTROL exception, according to parrot.

[17:54] <Tene> That's classy. :)

[17:54] <moritz_> that's... curious

[17:54] <diakopter> ?

[17:55] *** rfordinal joined
[17:56] <moritz_> diakopter: make a version of fib.pir in mono where you don't declare the number to be an integer

[17:56] <diakopter> or just low-level message dispatching/routing/delegating?

[17:56] <diakopter> moritz_: a boxed integer, then

[17:56] <moritz_> no

[17:56] <moritz_> fib("23") would work too, in the parrot case

[17:57] <moritz_> so it needs to coerces to a number

[17:57] <diakopter> in fib.pir, they're all "int"

[17:57] <moritz_> and then use the addition that fits best to the number format that the coercion return

[17:58] <moritz_> then s/int/pmc/g in parrot's fib.pir

[17:58] <moritz_> for a fair comparison

[17:58] <hejki> rakudo: my $str = "foo10bar"; $str ~~ /(\D+)(\d+)/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int; $str ~~ /(\D+)(\d+)?/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int;

[17:58] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: 10.int 10␤10.int 1␤

[17:58] <diakopter> ah, ok.  what low-level types should _fib be able to coerce from?

[17:58] <moritz_> from whatever you pass to it.

[17:59] <hejki> rakudo: my $str = "foo10000bar"; $str ~~ /(\D+)(\d+)/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int; $str ~~ /(\D+)(\d+)?/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int;

[17:59] <p6eval> rakudo 55f51d: 10000.int 10000␤10000.int 1␤

[17:59] <diakopter> right, I mean, which ones would you like to be able to handley?  I mean, you can't send in just any PMC and expect it to coerce to Additive (or whatever)

[17:59] <hejki> say .WHAT ~ " and why? :<" 

[17:59] <diakopter> obviously string...

[18:00] <moritz_> diakopter: I don't really care, because the actually coercion will be carried out only in the first call

[18:00] <diakopter> then how would it be a microbenchmark that tests anything?

[18:01] <moritz_> what I care about is that at every recursion step it has to *potentially* coerce to num, and has to dispatch at run time according to the actual type

[18:01] <diakopter> ah, ok; lemme try that

[18:01] <moritz_> so that it would work if you define a new number type, which its own overridden + operator

[18:02] <diakopter> moritz_: should fib always return an int?

[18:02] <moritz_> no

[18:02] <diakopter> ok

[18:03] <hejki> odd that passive grouping makes it Str

[18:04] <hejki> rakudo: my $str = "foo10000bar"; $str ~~ /(\D+)(\d+)/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int; $str ~~ m:P5/(\D+)(\d+)?/; say "$1.int " ~ $1.Int;

[18:04] <hejki> :>

[18:04] <diakopter> moritz_: I suspect I'll need help making fib_pmc.pir work... replacing all the int with pmc made a breakageness

[18:50] <masak> I find those releases don't get much press around here.

[18:51] <moritz_> I think that's intentional

[18:51] <colomon> someone's maintaining pugs enough to bump it to the latest GHC?  That's great!

[18:51] <diakopter> moritz_: ok, I have a fib_ with this signature:  

[18:51] <diakopter> moritz_: ok, I have a fib_ with this signature:  		public static int AddTo (this int left, int right) {

[18:51] <diakopter> 			return left + right;

[18:51] <diakopter> er

[18:51] <hejki> updated :)

[18:51] <diakopter> public static int AddTo (this int left, int right) {

[18:51] <masak> diakopter: 'this int'?

[18:51] <diakopter> oh wait

[18:51] <diakopter> wrong paste

[18:52] <masak> I'll say :)

[18:52] <diakopter> static object _fib (object n)

[18:52] <diakopter> does a type check with every invocation

[18:52] <diakopter> (at least 1, more if necessary)

[18:54] <moritz_> and then a run-time dispatch to +?

[18:54] <diakopter> yep

[18:54] <diakopter> (based on that type check)

[18:54] <diakopter> I home-spun my own PIC

[18:54] <diakopter> of sorts.

[18:55] <diakopter> well, it prespecializes + and < using generics

[18:55] <diakopter> and calls those after coercing

[18:55] <diakopter> but, per your requirement, it does the reflection-style type-check with every call

[18:55] <moritz_> so, how fast is it?

[18:55] <diakopter> (and subsequent casting, if necessary)

[18:55] <diakopter> about 1000x slower than it was previously

[18:56] <diakopter> but still 13x faster than parrot

[18:57] <diakopter> sorry, 16x faster than fib_pmc, and 13x faster than fib

[18:57] <diakopter> here's the code

[18:58] <moritz_> *drumrolls*

[18:58] <diakopter> http://parrot.pastebin.com/d5900184c

[19:00] <diakopter> to make it easier to look at (it would compile effectively to the same thing), I could make _fib an extension method also

[19:00] <diakopter> (so that the type check wouldn't be expressed in an if statement)

[19:00] <moritz_> looks roughly as I expected

[19:01] <diakopter> in case you (or anyone) weren't (wasn't) aware, C# Extension methods are resolved at compile time...

[19:02] *** stephenlb joined
[19:02] *** payload joined
[19:03] * moritz_ doesn't even speak C#

[19:03] *** ruoso left
[19:04] <diakopter> think of extension methods as just tricky global functions that are overloaded on all their arg types (including invocant)

[19:05] <diakopter> letting it stringify and then parse to double with *every* call makes it 3x slower than parrot

[19:05] <diakopter> that's a lot of stringification and parsing

[19:05] <moritz_> that's hardly a fair comparison

[19:05] <moritz_> with forced stringification

[19:05] <diakopter> i know :P

[19:05] <diakopter> I mean

[19:06] <diakopter> makes it 3x slower than fib_pmc as it is (without making parrot stringify/parse)

[19:06] <moritz_> diakopter: can you remove the special case for int and float, and always dispatch to AddTo? (and install these methods in the int and float types)

[19:06] <diakopter> ah... I see what you're saying, one sec

[19:07] <moritz_> (not sure if it makes the comparison any more fair, just curious what the result is)

[19:07] *** rfordinal3643 joined
[19:12] <diakopter> it still has to do the type check and then cast to those types...

[19:12] <moritz_> diakopter: I think you now know why the parrot people weren't all that impressed when you told them that fib.pir is slow compared to the mono version

[19:13] <diakopter> no

[19:13] <diakopter> b/c I wanted to test primitive operations

[19:14] <diakopter> I didn't want to test how well C#/mono could perform at pushing a dynamic object model down into the assembly language

[19:15] <diakopter> I wanted to compare how well PASM/PIR could perform as assembly languages for things marked as strongly typed

[19:15] <diakopter> (int, not pmc)

[19:15] <diakopter> I mean, Perl 6 isn't PASM :P

[19:15] <diakopter> and won't be written in PASM

[19:16] <moritz_> right

[19:16] <diakopter> all the object models don't have to be at the same (bottom) layer

[19:16] <moritz_> but you'll be hard pressed to actually compile Perl 6 operations down to primitive types

[19:16] <diakopter> right, but that's not what I'm suggesting

[19:16] <moritz_> even though I wish it were easy :-)

[19:16] <diakopter> I wasn't comparing Perl 6 source code to C# source code

[19:16] <moritz_> I see your point

[19:17] <diakopter> I was comparing them as assembly/target languages

[19:17] <moritz_> I just think that most parrot developers are aware that that's not what parrot is optimized for (if it's optimized for anything at all :-)

[19:18] <moritz_> (and yes, I agree that parrot should be much faster :-)

[19:19] <diakopter> yeah. but (possibly) what I'm suggesting is that forcing a dynamic object model into the lowest assembly language isn't as efficient as having one (or more) layers of indirection, if those layers of indirection are sufficiently [more] efficient than the all-in-one object model

[19:19] <diakopter> where by "suggesting" I mean "suspecting" :)

[19:20] <PerlJam> diakopter: Also if those layers give us more opportunity for optimization.

[19:20] <masak> intriguing.

[19:20] <PerlJam> (or is that what you're really saying?)

[19:20] <moritz_> parrot tries to fill this gap by allowing C code. Not sure if that's the right way to go

[19:21] <diakopter> PerlJam: yes, is by "us" you mean optimizing compilers with person-millenia of work behind them

[19:21] <diakopter> taking nqp-rx as an example

[19:22] <diakopter> stage0.pir, stage1.pir

[19:22] <diakopter> if I'm not mistaken, nearly everything in those programs is being used as strongly typed

[19:23] <diakopter> and gotos/labels

[19:24] <diakopter> here's my thought (more)

[19:25] <diakopter> having them in .pir (as opposed to C) merely gives them independence from gcc, right?

[19:25] <diakopter> (runtime code generation/compiling/loading)

[19:26] <diakopter> (without depending on gcc)

[19:26] <diakopter> following that line of thinking, CIL (Common Intermediate Language) (what mono compiles to before it compiles to machine code) is the assembly language I was comparing to PASM/PIR

[19:27] <diakopter> but mono (and of course the clr) has the same dynamic assembly language generation/compiling/loading capabilities as parrot

[19:29] <diakopter> yes, in a dynamic language (unless you can infer/work out more specific types than how they're marked in the user source code) all the primitives types will be boxed and dynamically dispatched

[19:29] <diakopter> but that doesn't mean that you can't also have efficient primitive types

[19:30] <diakopter> (so that's what I was comparing, parrot's primitive strongly typed variables vs mono's)

[19:30] <diakopter> </soapbox>

[19:36] <diakopter> so, if mono is 10-20x (and in some cases 100-1000x) faster than parrot in operations on those primitive types (and invocations, not to mention GC and JIT), and if a Perl 6 impl is going to be compiling to *any* kind of assembly language, then that Perl 6 impl should consider using a VM/compiler that has reasonably efficient primitive types, not one where stringops are slower than in Perl 5

[19:36] *** rgrau joined
[19:40] <PerlJam> diakopter: sure ... except that someone has already written the underlying pieces that Rakudo uses in Parrot.   :)

[19:41] <PerlJam> It would be interesting to see the PAST/POST/etc. stuff target some other VM though.

[19:41] *** jaldhar left
[19:42] <diakopter> it's not as much of a sunk cost as you might think, I'd like to suggest

[19:42] <masak> I just want my Perl 6 to be fast.

[19:42] <masak> if Parrot doesn't get me there first, so be it.

[19:42] <diakopter> I mean

[19:42] <masak> we don't know exactly what the right formula is. that's why we're doing this flood-fill thing with Perl 6 implementations.

[19:42] <PerlJam> diakopter: I agree it's probably not  that much of a sunk cost, but someone still has to do the work.

[19:42] <diakopter> it *is* more of a sunk cost than you might think, I'd like to suggest <frown>

[19:43] <colomon> I'm with masak.  Perl 6 is an awesome design, but it needs to be 100x faster (at least) to be reasonably useful, IMO. 

[19:43] <diakopter> (sorry, confusion of terms)

[19:43] <diakopter> PerlJam: yeah :/

[19:44] <PerlJam> colomon: 100x faster?  really?  Are you sure?

[19:44] <diakopter> PerlJam: I'm working on that

[19:44] * colomon has to admit that a fully .NET compatible would be pretty damn useful for his $work.

[19:44] <diakopter> ... I agree with colomon.. at least 100x faster

[19:44] <colomon> PerlJam: yes.

[19:44] <diakopter> wel

[19:44] <colomon> Anything that iterates is dead dog slow in Rakudo.

[19:44] <diakopter> "feeling" 100x "more responsive", let's say :)

[19:44] <PerlJam> I think it would be "reasonably useful" at 10x faster.  

[19:44] *** KatrinaTheLamia left
[19:45] <PerlJam> 100x faster would be more like "awesomely useful" 

[19:45] <colomon> right now I'm pretty sure there are pretty common cases where Perl 5 is 1000x faster than Rakudo.

[19:45] <masak> nod.

[19:45] <masak> but Perl 5 is impressively fast in places.

[19:45] <PerlJam> colomon: great!  Where are the benchmarks so we can put them into the repo?

[19:46] *** payload left
[19:46] <diakopter> I didn't know that rakudo had benchmark comparisons

[19:46] <colomon> PerlJam: I don't have time to put them together at the moment, but if you seriously think it's a good idea to have them, it won't be a problem at all next time I have some spare tuits...

[19:47] <PerlJam> colomon: I do think it's a good idea to keep benchmarks around so that we can know how (if) we are progressing when we attempt optimization.

[19:47] <diakopter> try some pathological grammar patterns :)

[19:47] <colomon> I haven't tested it, but I'd be willing to bet a beer than a straightforward word count script is 1000x faster in p5 than Rakudo.

[19:48] <colomon> at least on a reasonable length file.

[19:48] <colomon> though come to think of it, given the current seg fault issues in Rakudo, it may be hard to see the full extent of the slow down.

[19:49] * PerlJam fails in "eating without making a mess"

[19:51] <diakopter> (note: I am certainly *not* saying that mono (or ocaml or V8 or ghc) was as capable/reliable 7-8 years ago)

[19:52] <diakopter> existent/capable/reliable

[19:52] <diakopter> it's just had probably a few hundred times as many resources/attention

[19:53] <moritz_> sorry, got distracted by distressing phone call

[19:53] * moritz_ backlogs

[19:54] <colomon> BTW, to be fair, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Rakudo can get 100x boost in the next six months.  I'm not down on Parrot, I just want to be able to stop making excuses for why Rakudo is so slow.

[19:59] <PerlJam> moritz_: I hope your phone call ended with the distress gone.

[20:40] <masak> PerlJam: 'trunk' is an SVN term for 'master' :P

[20:41] <moritz_> chromatic: it builds against the released version of parrot here

[20:41] <chromatic> "Trunk" means "not the -ng branch".

[20:41] <PerlJam> ah, good.

[20:41] *** plainhao left
[20:41] <PerlJam> It sounded like you were after the latest rakudo against the latest parrot

[20:42] <PerlJam> pm updated the PARROT_REVISION to be the latest release version of Parrot even

[20:43] <PerlJam> blah.  I could have sworn that was master

[20:43] <moritz_> maybe I'm wrong

[20:43] <colomon> nope, it was ng.

[20:43] <PerlJam> no, I just checked :)

[20:44] <colomon> surely I'm not the only one with a github ng commit history tab in his browser?  ;)

[20:44] * PerlJam doesn't typically look at git repo history via a web browser

[20:45] <chromatic> I ask because I'm doing a release dry run.

[20:45] <colomon> but how can you quickly tell if anyone else has been hacking on ng?  :)

[20:45] <PerlJam> colomon: I assume it is so and I am right  ;)

[20:46] <moritz_> colomon: git log

[20:46] <colomon> moritz_: don't you need to pull  to get an up-to-date log?

[20:49] <chromatic> Yes.

[20:50] <moritz_> chromatic: due to large changes in spec and spectets, rakudo/master is currently frozen to a particular revision of the spectests

[20:50] <moritz_> chromatic: so if tests fail, it's no good to fudge them in the test suite, but you have to comment them out from t/spectest.data

[20:52] <PerlJam> chromatic: commit them for  the release, then revert the commits afterwards

[20:52] * PerlJam would never conceive  to put the words "cake" and "duck" together

[20:53] <diakopter> http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/Soul_Cake_Duck

[20:55] <colomon> "The Soul Cake Duck is rumored to be paranoid beyond sanity and generally in a very bad mood."  Awesome.

[20:55] <chromatic> Alright, here's an update to PARROT_REVISION.

[20:55] <masak> PerlJam: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguification

[20:56] <PerlJam> Perl 6 linguifies words into a good soup.

[20:56] <masak> :)

[20:57] <masak> I never thought I'd see "Perl 6" next to "linguifies". :P

[20:57] <jnthn> fwiw, it may be that Rakudo master needs a patch to build against latest Parrot; I'm sure I had to chase a Parrot breakage in ng at some point recently, but didn't patch master.

[20:57] <masak> or "Perl 6" in the same sentence as "soup"...

[20:57] <diakopter> masak: oh, the irony

[20:57] <dalek> rakudo/master: 98b3f18 | chromatic++ | build/PARROT_REVISION:

[20:57] <dalek> rakudo/master: Updated PARROT_REVISION for Parrot release 1.9.0.

[20:58] <PerlJam> masak: It's all par for the course on #perl6  :)

[20:58] <masak> PerlJam: yes. I'm just kidding around.

[20:58] <PerlJam> (especially when that TimToady guy is around  ;-)

[20:58] <diakopter> (speaking of golfing)

[20:58] <masak> PerlJam: yeah, who invited that guy? :P

[21:00] * PerlJam bates his breath in anticipation of diakopter's offering

[21:03] <diakopter> wait, what?

[21:03] * diakopter confused

[21:03] <diakopter> I usually can only pick up that puns are being made, not the actual joke behind the puns

[21:04] <diakopter> (speaking of speaking of speaking of linguification)

[21:04] <masak> those kinds of jokes are so common that they should have a name.

[21:05] <masak> maybe 'autopuns'?

[21:05] <masak> "we're all eager to get lazy lists" is an autopun, for example. even though it has a determinant of -1. :P

[21:05] <PerlJam> autopun sounds like a good word to me

[21:06] <masak> let's see how long it takes until someone makes an autopun about autopuns!

[21:06] <masak> oh wait.

[21:07] <diakopter> punners are punnier when their names are punned upon for pun

[21:09] <wayland76> I may've used this before, but: If I were ever pun-i-shed / for every pun I shed / I'd run and find a punny shed / and there I'd hang my punnish head :)

[21:09] <masak> wayland76++ # puns with sheds

[21:10] <pmichaud> back again

[21:10] <pmichaud> sorta

[21:13] <wayland76> Now I'm confused by the difference between an autopun and a pun.

[21:14] <Tene> wayland76: you don't need to worry about the difference.  it'll take care of itself.

[21:15] <masak> wayland76: let's see. a pun is a joke on words. an autopun isn't necessarily a pun, but needs to make an implicit joke which exhibits the property joked about.

[21:15] <masak> wayland76: example: "they told be these pills would make me stronger, but I'm unable to open the jar."

[21:15] <masak> (I apologise profusely for that one.)

[21:17] <wayland76> Ok, but how is "we're all eager to get lazy lists" not a pun then?

[21:18] <chromatic> t/spec/S02-lexical-conventions/unicode.rakudo, t/spec/S03-junctions/associative.t, t/spec/S03-junctions/autothreading.rakudo, t/spec/S06-other/main-eval.t, and t/spec/S12-class/basic.rakudo all have failures for me.

[21:18] <masak> wayland76: that one is a pun, too. the one about the pills isn't.

[21:18] <masak> but both are autopuns.

[21:19] <colomon> chromatic: that list sounds right to me.

[21:19] <wayland76> ok.  "Autopuns" is a superset of "puns"?  Or an overlapping category?  I was assuming that "autopun" would be a subset of "pun"

[21:20] <masak> overlapping category.

[21:20] <chromatic> How likely is it that any of those will get fixed in the next 24 hours?

[21:20] <masak> wayland76: which leads me to think that the term might not be the best one.

[21:20] <masak> wayland76: it's more of a self-referent joke-oid.

[21:21] <wayland76> autojoke?

[21:21] <masak> yes, except it's not about cars. :)

[21:21] <wayland76> Yeah, or automatic anything.

[21:21] <Tene> masak: and if my car tells jokes about cars?

[21:22] <masak> Tene: then you should probably see a mechanic. :P

[21:31] <moritz_> chromatic: and once you've done that, perl tools/test_summary.pl

[21:31] <chromatic> Some of this should go in docs/release_guide.pod.

[21:32] <chromatic> Or I should read and not skim.

[21:32] <pmichaud> tools/test_summary.pl gives an idea of the size of the test suite and the number of passing tests

[21:32] <moritz_> the no-fudging thing is specific to this release

[21:33] <chromatic> Right, I figured the -ng branch made things weird.

[21:33] <pmichaud> but I'll be updating docs/spectest-progress.csv around 01:00 CST tonight, and it's okay to use that number

[21:34] <jnthn> *fail

[21:35] <chromatic> I'll fill out everything I need now and can fill in more details tomorrow... unless it's easier to wait.

[21:35] <pmichaud> fill out now and more tomorrow tends to work well

[21:35] <pmichaud> other elves often add more things once it's been started

[21:35] <moritz_> chromatic: if you stub in a release announcement I'll add some deprecation notices

[21:36] <chromatic> I haven't paid attention to new features and such.  I'll commit now with spaces for numbers and specifics.

[21:36] <pmichaud> that's a good approach

[21:36] <pmichaud> I'm planning to update it with my views of features and such

[21:36] <moritz_> there weren't many new features in master since the last release

[22:15] <jnthn> chromatic: master is broken on Win32

[22:15] <jnthn> chromatic: This is the ng patch:

[22:15] <jnthn> http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/8d154158b0ac001c349fb3d3756c7bfe0d893046

[22:16] <jnthn> It'll fix autothreading test breakage too, I expect.

[22:16] <masak> chromatic: spectest run summary: http://gist.github.com/258236

[22:16] <chromatic> Autothreading everywhere, or only Win32?

[22:16] <jnthn> chromatic: everywhere.

[22:16] <jnthn> chromatic: Actually, I am utterly bewildered still at why the build works for anyone.

[22:16] <chromatic> Clean living.

[22:17] <jnthn> chromatic: since the error is

[22:17] <jnthn> perl6_ops.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _GETATTR_CallSignature

[22:17] <jnthn> _results

[22:17] <chromatic> Oh yes, I wondered at that error too.

[22:18] <jnthn> Yeah. I dunno how we get away with it on other platforms.

[22:18] <chromatic> Hm, I'm not sure I have the branch pulled here.

[22:18] *** imaltb joined
[22:18] <jnthn> I'm not quite sure how you cherry pick commits from one to another anyway

[22:19] <jnthn> You'll have it as origin/ng at least, I suspect.

[22:19] *** rgrau`` left
[22:19] <Tene> git cherry-pick <commit-id>

[22:20] <jnthn> heh, then just git cherry-pick 8d154158b0ac001c349fb3d3756c7bfe0d893046 then :-)

[22:20] <chromatic> That worked.

[22:20] <jnthn> yay 

[22:20] <chromatic> ... after git fetch upstream.

[22:20] <jnthn> chromatic++

[22:22] <frettled> Hey, maybe Win32 is dead when Rakudo * is released?  :D

[22:22] <frettled> *hope hope hope*

[22:23] <chromatic> Testing the autothreading test now.

[22:23] <chromatic> Certainly there are fewer build warnings.

[22:24] <masak> you know, you don't *need* to write all 40 chars of the SHA-1 :)

[22:25] <Tene> masak: easier to copy/paste the entire thing than just the first part

[22:26] <Tene> double-click vs click+drag+choose-when-to-stop

[22:26] <masak> fair enough.

[22:27] <chromatic> Hmm, this is weird.

[22:27] <chromatic> $ git push upstream master

[22:27] <chromatic> To [email@hidden.address]
[22:27] <chromatic>  ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast forward)

[22:27] <chromatic> error: failed to push some refs to [email@hidden.address]
[22:29] *** cotto_w0rk left
[22:29] *** payload left
[22:29] <masak> chromatic: that happens when your repo isn't a descendent of upstream. you need to pull or something.

[22:30] <chromatic> That looks better.

[22:30] *** gabiruh left
[22:30] <masak> see y'all tomorrow, #perl6.

[22:30] *** masak left
[22:30] <moritz_> good night

[22:32] <jnthn> yup, that fixes the Win32 build

[22:32] <jnthn> Well

[22:32] <jnthn> it doesn't break at that point

[22:32] <jnthn> Should be fine though.

[22:45] <pmurias> diakopter: the hard part with getting good performance is that you have to infer when to unwrap primitives

[22:53] *** supernovus joined
[22:54] *** kaare_ left
[22:56] *** iblechbot left
[22:57] <supernovus> I have a small question. I know wantarray was originally to be replaced by want but that eventually want was killed off entirely. What replaces it? By that I mean, if I have a method that can return either a scalar value or a list, how would I go about doing that?

[22:57] <IllvilJa> does rakudo have any debugger mode?

[22:58] <diakopter> pmurias: yes, but, (again) I wasn't testing anything like that

[22:58] <diakopter> I was testing the primitives

[22:58] <moritz_> supernovus: the method returns an object that does the right thing in either context

[22:58] <diakopter> I wasn't testing dynamicness/boxing/dispatching

[23:00] <supernovus> I think that's where I'm having problems, is making an object that works as an array. 

[23:00] *** drbean_ left
[23:01] <moritz_> supernovus: list context works by calling the List method on that object

[23:01] <moritz_> supernovus: so you can create an object that return a list when the List method is called

[23:03] <supernovus> Interesting, I tried just that, but for some reason, it still returns the results of the Str method instead of the List method.

[23:05] <wayland76> supernovus: Can you nopaste your code that calls it?

[23:07] <moritz_> supernovus: it might not be well implemented in Rakudo right now

[23:08] <supernovus> That may be the case. I have pasted my example class and the script that calls it.

[23:08] <supernovus> one change is that I have changed Array to List in the class.
