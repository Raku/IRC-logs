[04:16] <frew> Hey all

[04:16] <frew> I was looking into helping out with some stuff

[04:16] <frew> and I wanted to make sure my test was right because everything seems to fail it

[04:17] <frew> Specifically in TASKS for S29 it says that positional args should work for lots of builtins

[04:17] <frew> but they don

[04:17] <frew> 't

[12:14] <masak> non-locking reading of individual characters: will such a thing be implementation-specific?

[12:16] <jnthn> masak: non-locking?

[12:16] <jnthn> Or non-blocking?

[12:16] <masak> jnthn: the latter.

[12:16] <masak> like $INKEY in QBasic.

[12:17] <moritz_> masak: just write it in S16, then everybody has to implement it :-)

[12:17] <masak> moritz_: good idea. :) I wish I were that bold.

[12:17] <jnthn> masak: There should be a standard way to do it in Perl 6.

[12:17] <jnthn> How implementations implement it is up to them.

[12:17] <masak> jnthn: really? that makes me very glad.

[12:17] <jnthn> I woulda thought so.

[12:18] <jnthn> I think it's possible on most platforms...

[12:18] <jnthn> AIO and all that.

[12:18] <masak> right.

[12:18] <masak> suggestions for a reasonable syntax?

[12:18] *** rob joined

[12:21] <moritz_> masak: $STDIN.getc(:!block)

[12:21] <masak> moritz_: you mean, $*IN, of course.

[12:21] <moritz_> erm, yes :)

[12:22] <masak> maybe something positive instead of :!block ?

[12:22] <jnthn> :async?

[12:22] <moritz_> where it would just return an empty string, and on error it would fail()

[12:22] * jnthn is horrid at syntax

[12:22] <jnthn> irclogs?

[12:22] <jnthn> purl, irclogs?

[12:23] <moritz_> no purl in #perl6

[12:23] <moritz_> irc.pugscode.org

[12:23] <jnthn> ooh, channel fail

[12:23] *** mberends joined
[12:24] <masak> jnthn: not at all. it's a feature that purl isn't here.

[12:24] <masak> the logs are in the topic.

[12:24] * masak likes :async

[12:25] <jnthn> masak: More of a fail on my part for thinking I was on #parrot

[12:26] <mberends> looking at keyboard interactive code on various systems, it is definitely platform specific

[12:26] <moritz_> perl has a long history of abstracting away such things

[12:28] <mberends> ja, perl5 has modules that automagically map to the underlying drivers

[12:33] <masak> nevertheless, I'm pleasantly surprised to hear that it'll be available in core. that will surely help when writing the kind of programs that need async getc.

[12:34] <jnthn> masak: Just because I'd expect it to be, doesn't mean it will be. ;-)

[12:37] <pmurias> hi rindolf

[12:37] <rindolf> pmurias: what's up?

[12:38] <jnthn> masak,moritz_: Which one of you was it that did the Perl 6 prelude, or who I need permission from to do stuff with it, or a commit bit?

[12:38] <jnthn> As in, the one for Rakudo...

[12:38] <moritz_> jnthn: it was me...

[12:38] <jnthn> OK

[12:39] <moritz_> jnthn: you need a gmail email adress, then I can give you commit bit

[12:39] <jnthn> I'm pondering starting to fill out the array/hash roles

[12:39] <jnthn> jnthnwrthngtn

[12:39] <jnthn> I can't just call them Array and stuff as it'll conflict.

[12:39] <jnthn> Maybe P6PArray etc?

[12:40] <jnthn> But it'd mean I can actually get typed arrays working somewhat.

[12:40] *** iblechbot left
[12:40] <jnthn> And then when the prelude "goes official" they can just be renamed and become the real ones.

[12:40] <jnthn> Does this sound OK to you?

[12:41] <moritz_> sure

[12:41] <moritz_> jnthn: ok, you are a project admin now... http://code.google.com/p/rakudo-prelude/source/checkout for instructions

[12:42] <jnthn> moritz_: Thanks. Going for lunch/walk now, will play later. :-)

[12:42] <pmurias> rindolf: i'm studing CS now; smop now has basic p5 interop

[12:43] <rindolf> pmurias: ah.

[12:44] <moritz_> jnthn: have fun... I'll be offline during the weekend, feel free to do with that repo whatever you want

[12:45] <pmurias> rindolf: i find the "what's up?" question too generic to anwser accuratly ;)

[12:46] <rindolf> pmurias: OK.

[12:46] <rindolf> I'm trying to optimise File-Find-Object now.

[12:47] <jnthn> moritz_: I'll try not to do anything too awful. ;-)

[12:47] <moritz_> jnthn: it keeps track of the revision... I can always restore the previous state :-)

[14:43] <pmichaud> what am I supposed to be looking for/at ?

[14:49] <mberends> sorry, the code is incompatible with latest parrot/rakudo. the looking for/at was that some later parrots cause that PGE;Match message mentioned yesterday.

[14:50] <pmichaud> okay, I can look at that.

[14:51] <mberends> with r35309 (pre rvar2) it shows you Pod::Parser running some tests of pod6 in Rakudo

[14:52] <mberends> that $*ERR sure would help troubleshooting on latest rakudo...

[14:57] *** alexn_org left
[15:01] <mberends> oops, error has changed. I hope it runs with the suggested r35308 though, did you try that also?

[15:06] *** km2 left
[15:07] *** ruoso left
[15:09] <mberends> The immediate goal was to reproduce the PGE;Match under your eyes, but the latest error is different so I'm failing on that. The broader goal was to show you some Pod6 tools that masak and I plan to beef up for his U4X project. Did you ever see a prove and Test::Harness written in Perl 6 before?

[15:10] <pmichaud> no, haven't seen those.

[15:10] <pmichaud> I'm waaaaay behind on being able to review things :-|

[15:11] <pmichaud> I don't know why you're getting the latest error, it looks like it should be okay to me.

[15:11] <pmichaud> (but haven't looked in great detail)

[15:13] <mberends> I cannot suggest other actions right now. thanks for looking, and I'll try to get that PGE;Match for you another way. TiMBuS may have spotted a grammar / regex bug for me this morning. Again thanks, I'll stop distracting you for today.

[15:14] <pmichaud> I'm still planning to work on $*ERR this morning.

[17:46] <szabgab> rakudo: my %h; %h{'a'}.exists;

[17:46] <p6eval> rakudo 35914: OUTPUT«Method 'exists' not found for invocant of class 'Failure'␤current instr.: 'parrot;P6metaclass;dispatch' pc 287 (src/classes/ClassHOW.pir:145)␤»

[17:48] <TimToady> if there is a .exists method, it would be used %h.exists('a')

[17:49] <szabgab> rakudo: my %h; %h.exists('a');

[17:49] <p6eval> rakudo 35914: RESULT«0»

[17:49] <szabgab> std: my %h; %h.exists('a');

[17:49] <p6eval> std 25009: OUTPUT«00:05 84m␤»

[17:49] <szabgab> std: my %h; %h{'a'}.exists;

[17:49] <TimToady> std won't tell you if there is a method of that name :)

[17:50] <p6eval> std 25009: OUTPUT«00:05 84m␤»

[17:50] <szabgab> so the last one is a mistake ?

[17:50] <TimToady> std: my %h; %h{'a'}.foo.bar.baz

[17:50] <p6eval> std 25009: OUTPUT«00:05 87m␤»

[17:50] <TimToady> see, legal

[17:50] <szabgab> ah

[17:51] <TimToady> std is just syntax, with occasional semantic checking

[17:51] <szabgab> ok and what about exixts %h{'a'} ?

[17:51] <szabgab> should that, err exist ?

[17:51] <TimToady> it can tell you that a function is unrecognized only because the def is required to exist by CHECK time

[17:51] <TimToady> methods bind later than CHECK time

[17:52] <TimToady> there is no exists macro anymore

[17:52] <TimToady> because it would have to be a macro

[17:52] <TimToady> likewise delete

[17:52] <szabgab> so I understand that the spec test is incorrect then

[17:53] <TimToady> yes, it's incorrect

[17:54] <szabgab> thanks

[17:54] <TimToady> assuming there's a .exists method, it would not be incorrect if it actually did what the comment said

[17:54] <TimToady> that is, if the comma were a colon

[17:56] <szabgab> oh, now I got confused

[17:56] <TimToady> exists $x, $y is a function call

[17:56] <TimToady> exists $x: $y is a method call

[17:56] <szabgab> so is there going to be an .exists metho for the hashes or an exists function in main?

[17:56] <TimToady> equiv to $x.exists($y)

[17:56] <TimToady> there will not be an exists function

[17:57] <TimToady> if there's a method, it should probably be .contains

[17:58] <szabgab> so currntly we don't know yet how to test if a certain key is available in a hash as it is not speced yet?

[17:58] <TimToady> but we're trying to discourage the method interface in favor of .{$y}:exists

[17:59] <TimToady> :exists is specced

[17:59] <TimToady> in fact, STD.pm uses it, and :delete too

[18:00] <TimToady> they're just modified subscripting operations, after all

[18:00] *** schmalbe joined
[18:00] <szabgab> so I should write %h :exists 'a'  ?

[18:00] <TimToady> no, the whole idea is to write the subscript the same way always

[18:00] <TimToady> %h<a>:exists

[18:00] <TimToady> %h{'a'}:exists

[18:01] <TimToady> you can even do %h{'a'} :exists :delete

[18:01] <szabgab> and delete ?  the same ?

[18:02] <szabgab> which would do what ?

[18:02] <TimToady> delete the element, and return true if there was one

[18:02] <szabgab> ah, and what is :delete along returns ?

[18:03] <szabgab> the old value ?

[18:03] <TimToady> they're just named arguments to the subscript operator, so order doesn't matter

[18:03] <TimToady> what :delete returns by defualt

[18:03] <TimToady> *default

[18:03] <TimToady> just as in p5

[18:05] <szabgab> so in case are  :exists and :delete adverbs or they just look like adverbs?

[18:05] <szabgab> to my untrained eyes ?

[18:05] <TimToady> they're adverbs syntactically

[18:05] <TimToady> the compiler may choose to treat them specially though

[18:06] <TimToady> but they should work as if subscript were just multi dispatched based on presence/absence of named args

[18:09] <TimToady> you should be able to write your own multi subscript operator with additional modifiers, and it should just work

[18:09] <szabgab> Oh I am just trying to use what is already there :-)

[18:09] <TimToady> or not, as the case may be :)

[18:14] <TimToady> afk &
