[00:01] <s1n> how do i indicate a method in a class/role cannot be overwritten?

[00:01] <s1n> similar to leaving final (in Java) or virtual (in C++) off the proto/definition

[00:02] <s1n> i want the derived/composed class to inherit the method but it cannot override it

[15:08] <Matt-W> a what??

[15:08] *** payload left
[15:08] <wayland76> An interlinear editing widget :)

[15:08] <Matt-W> what's an interlinear editing widget?

[15:08] <Matt-W> I've never heard of the concept

[15:09] <wayland76> An interlinear book is one which has eg. the first line in Greek, and the second line is an English translation

[15:09] <[particle]-> it lets you edit what's between the lines

[15:09] <wayland76> ...and the third line is Greek again

[15:09] *** szabgab left

[15:10] *** brunov joined
[15:12] <Matt-W> oh wow

[15:12] <Matt-W> so it's designed for editing books in that format

[15:13] <Matt-W> rather than, say, editing the two languages separately and getting the typesetter to combine them later

[15:13] <Matt-W> that sounds challenging

[15:13] <Matt-W> nice to have a challenge

[15:15] *** pyrimidine joined
[15:16] <wayland76> Yes, that's right :)

[15:17] <wayland76> And, since the whole thing will have to be kinda based around cells, I'm going to add the extra challenge of also supporting other editing widgets (ie. equation widgets) in it too

[15:17] <wayland76> But I'll hopefully use other people's equation widgets

[16:50] <literal> I don't think you understand

[16:51] <tpf_particle> rakudo: role a { method b { say 'role' } }; class c does a { method b { say 'class' }; say a.b();

[16:51] <tpf_particle> rakudo: role a { method b { say 'role' } }; class c does a { method b { say 'class' } }; say c.b();

[16:52] <p6eval> rakudo d208e1: OUTPUT«class␤»

[16:52] <tpf_particle> anyway, that's just as ovid said. class method silently overrides role method.

[16:53] <wayland76> I'd rather not have the warnings.  It would be like issuing a warning if you overrode something with inheritance

[16:53] <cjfields> agreed

[16:53] <tpf_particle> well, it's a different warning, since you're overriding with composition.  but, yes, it is like it.

[16:53] <tpf_particle> i'd like the warnings to exist, but not be enabled by default

[16:54] <wayland76> That would be fine by me

[16:54] <tpf_particle> however, since the object system is totally pluggable in perl 6, you can define a new class metaobject that does the warning.

[16:55] <tpf_particle> so, if they don't exist in std perl 6, fine, create a small module that puts them in for you.

[16:55] <wayland76> :)

[16:55] *** exodist joined
[16:55] <cjfields> the way Moose is handling that is the other way around, correct?  enabling warnings, requiring an explicit 'excludes' to indicate an override?
