[02:17] <sjohnson> ya, i am the same way

[02:17] <sjohnson> I hate PHP when I compare it to Perl, and when I have to write in it for 7 hours a day at work

[02:18] <sjohnson> it, being PHP unfortunately

[02:18] <sjohnson> sometimes i get to make Perl script system calls

[02:18] <wayland76> Well, I liked PHP better (and worse) when I found the preg_* calls :)

[02:19] <sjohnson> yeah

[02:19] <sjohnson> preg_match and me have a long history of hating eachother

[02:20] <sjohnson> we've been locking horns ever since I started trying a few Perl-like tricks in PHP

[02:20] <wayland76> The one thing about preg_match that's better than p5 is the array of matches :)

[02:20] <sjohnson> that is true

[02:21] <sjohnson> is that fixed in P6?

[02:21] <wayland76> IIRC

[02:21] <sjohnson> i have noticed that problem

[02:21] <wayland76> There's a match variable

[02:21] <wayland76> and it does associative

[02:21] <wayland76> For example, say I have this regex: rule element {  '<' <name> <attribute>*  [  | '/>'  | '>' <child>* '</' $<name> '>'  ]  {*} }

[02:22] <wayland76> Then if the match variable is the default, I can do...

[02:22] <wayland76> (default match var is $/ )

[02:23] <wayland76> I can do: say $/<name> ~ " has attributes " ~ $/<attribute>

[03:59] <japhb> TimToady: Does your stricture about having the Perl 6 "core library" be as small as possible apply only to the spec standard, or to the base versions of the implementations as well?  This is coming up in the context of Parrot ... if Parrot ships a large core library, then Rakudo will effectively be doing so as well -- easy access to shared libraries being part of the point of Parrot, after all.  But if by chance Rakudo becomes the most pop

[03:59] <japhb> ular Perl 6 implementation, then users may begin to rely on Parrot's core library set ....  Thoughts?

[04:02] <wayland76> My assumption was that TimToady was not making that a rule for Parrot

[04:03] <wayland76> Besides, he recently said he wasn't going to have much connectivity until the conference

[04:03] <japhb> ah, forgot about that last.

[04:03] <wayland76> So you may have trouble getting any info out of him at the moment

[04:04] <wayland76> I'm in favour of doing it that way if possible, of course

[04:04] <japhb> As for the first, I'm wondering if in fact Parrot's decisions will end up overruling his wishes in *practice*, if not in theory.  :)

[04:05] <japhb> "doing it that way"?

[04:05] <wayland76> Yeah, I was thinking that to

[04:05] <wayland76> "doing it that way" = minimal libraries

[04:06] <wayland76> My main reasons for being in favour are: 1) TimToady's reasons for making the same decision about P6, and 2) otherwise, Parrot and P6 are pulling in opposite directions

[04:08] *** alester joined
[04:10] <japhb> wayland76: sure, but we have to consider that they do have separate goals.  Parrot's goal is to make it easy to bring up new dynamic languages to the level of being productively useful -- that's easier with a decent core set of libraries.  OTOH, another goal of Parrot is to make it easy for languages to use each other's libraries -- so Parrot wouldn't need to have them in "core".  So Parrot itself is pulling in different directions.  :-)

[04:12] <wayland76> That's why I'm also in agreement with doing it via a packaging system

[06:34] <Su-Shee> good morning. :)

[06:34] * masak waves at Su-Shee 

[06:36] * moritz_ points people to http://perlpilot.blogspot.com/2009/07/perl-6-documentation.html

[06:37] <Su-Shee> ah, very nice. :)

[06:37] <missingthepoint> i second that :)

[06:38] <Su-Shee> I had several interesting discussions the last few days with tech-friends of mine concerning perl 6. 

[06:38] <Su-Shee> (which all know about it, but don't follow the development)

[06:38] <moritz_> PerlJam: I'd like to have a commit bit ;-)

[06:39] <Su-Shee> they all say, they expect perl6 to be as fast as perl5 and to have at least a basic ecosystem like DBI and something like CGI.pm

[06:39] <masak> Su-Shee: it'll have 'something like CGI.pm', only updated for this decade.

[06:39] <moritz_> I think we can provide the basic ecosystem pretty soon

[06:40] <moritz_> the "as fast as perl5" is hard to achieve, unless parrot improves significantly

[06:40] <Su-Shee> masak: yeah, they just used it to illustrate what they want, they don't want CGI.pm again :)

[06:40] <moritz_> also note that perl 5 is one of the fastest dynamic language

[06:40] *** rfordinal left
[06:40] <Su-Shee> moritz_: well the intersting thing is that they _all_ consider speed as one of the first reasons to use perl.

[06:40] <moritz_> Su-Shee: thanks for sharing the results of your discussions

[06:40] <masak> testing Druid again after a long time, I have the impression that I/O has gotten blazingly fast, and everything else depressingly slow.

[06:40] <wayland76> Due probably to years of optimisation

[06:41] <wayland76> Grammars are slow :)

[06:41] <wayland76> masak: Did you see the bit in the backlog where I said "summon masak"?

[06:41] <masak> missingthepoint: any progress on the SVG-graphing idea?

[06:41] <masak> wayland76: I didn't. I can backlog soonish and catch it.

[06:41] <Su-Shee> moritz_: I have to admit that they all use Perl extremely high end - like daily nearly tb of logfile parsing and handling millions of domains and such... 

[06:41] <missingthepoint> masak: i'm blocking on porting Text::CSV, since I've not ported any Perl 5 -> 6, i think i'll start with that :)

[06:42] <missingthepoint> masak: give me a day or two

[06:42] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: you're Perlpilot? :)

[06:43] <moritz_> @seen PerlJam 

[06:43] <lambdabot> PerlJam is in #perl6. I last heard PerlJam speak 11h 45m 8s ago.

[06:44] <wayland76> What's the difference between Perlpilot and U4X?

[06:46] <masak> missingthepoint: absolutely.

[06:46] <masak> missingthepoint: let me know if there's anything I can assist with.

[06:46] <missingthepoint> masak: thank you, i will

[06:48] <masak> re proto having to change, I don't mind at all. if we don't insist on being able to load previous releases (and I don't see why we would have to) it's an easy patch and the resulting code will probably be slightly smaller.

[06:49] <moritz_> actually if it just uses perl Configure --gen-parrot it doesn't have to change at all.

[06:49] <mikehh> rakudo (a53a1cd) builds on parrot r40351 - make test PASS/ make spectest (up to 27822) same two tests FAIL - Ubuntu 9.04 amd64

[06:49] <moritz_> masak: I looked over the README to see if anything has to be changed in the ins2 branch, and didn't find anything ;-)

[06:49] <masak> moritz_: I was talking about the default setting, which fetches the latest Rakudo release.

[06:51] <moritz_> masak: that'll have to change if we change version numbers; but I don't see how the ins2 branch will affect it

[06:51] <masak> moritz_: neither do I. why are you bringing it up?

[06:52] <moritz_> masak: because I thought it might be need to change. But that was before I looked closer.

[06:52] <masak> wayland76: re backlog: you describe your problem, but don't supply any actual code. is it possible to summarize in a one-liner.

[06:52] <masak> moritz_: ah.

[06:52] <moritz_> sorry of the confusion

[06:53] <masak> I'm not very familiar with the changes introduced by ins2.

[06:53] <masak> but in general, think of proto as a piece of software very willing to adapt.

[06:57] <wayland76> masak: Possibly, but it may be easier to read as http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68066

[06:57] <wayland76> I'm very familiar with most of the changes made by ins2

[06:57] <wayland76> Although I may've missed some ramifications of them

[06:57] <wayland76> What do we want to know?

[06:58] <masak> well, what are the changes?

[06:58] <wayland76> Basically, everything required to make Rakudo work on an installed Parrot

[06:59] <wayland76> That involves adding a spec file for RPM (irrelevant)

[06:59] <wayland76> And changes to the Makefile

[06:59] <wayland76> Especially adding a "make install" target

[07:00] <masak> wayland76: thanks for the RT link, it helped. hm, I'm not sure that's ever worked.

[07:01] <moritz_> basically --gen-parrot installs parrot into a local sub dir

[07:01] <moritz_> http://www.sysadminday.com/

[07:01] <wayland76> masak: Re roles: Well, it parses; as long as you don't try to instantiate the object, it works fine :)

[07:02] <wayland76> Also, there appear to be some Configure.pl changes

[07:02] <wayland76> pmichaud did those.  Investigating

[07:02] <masak> wayland76: I was slightly surprised that you instantiated the role directly -- though I think that should be fine.

[07:02] <moritz_> rakudo: role B { method b { say "works" } }; role A does B  { }; A.new.b

[07:02] <p6eval> rakudo a53a1c: OUTPUT¬´works‚ê§¬ª

[07:03] <wayland76> re:ins2 -- Basically, Configure.pl now takes a --gen-parrot-prefix option

[07:03] *** rfordinal joined
[07:04] <wayland76> Yes, intantiating roles works, but only because roles are punned as classes

[07:04] <masak> right.

[07:04] <masak> I kinda knew it, but haven't had any use for it.

[07:04] <wayland76> In real life, I wasn't planning to do that, but it made the example simpler :)

[07:05] <masak> I suspected as much. :)

[07:06] <wayland76> In real life, the example roles are Tree and Tree::Node, and Tree::Element does Tree::Node, and XML::Element is Tree::Element :)

[07:06] <masak> how hierarchical.

[07:08] <wayland76> No, my mistake, class XML::Element does Tree::Element

[07:08] <wayland76> Well, Tree does Tree::Node; Tree::Node is the base class for everything

[07:09] <wayland76> So it's really only Tree::Node -> Tree::Element -> XML::Element

[07:09] <wayland76> I nicked a number of the general ideas in the Tree model from the XML DOM, but extended things enough so that it should also suit filesystems

[07:10] <wayland76> Oh, and I'm also hoping to cope with something that looks like XML, but can have some overlapping tags, depending on the "perspective"

[07:11] <masak> good luck.

[07:11] <wayland76> :)

[07:12] <missingthepoint> wayland76: (may be missing the point, but the code you posted before breaks with "<foo><!-- stuff --></foo>")

[07:13] <missingthepoint> (krunen's modified grammar, that is)

[07:13] <masak> I've been toying with the idea of unigying DOM and Match trees. even that feels a bit tricky, but it still should be more straightforward than unifying XML trees and file hierarchies.

[07:18] <masak> wayland76: well, I'm not out to convert anything. I'm just looking for a similar enough API to both so that I can traverse/search them in similar ways.

[07:18] <wayland76> WORKSFORME :)

[07:18] <missingthepoint> heh, should have guessed. :)

[07:18] <wayland76> masak: Then that's very similar to what I'm doing

[07:18] <wayland76> In fact, possibly identical :)

[07:18] <masak> wayland76: it's for the Grampa project, which I've blogged a bit about.

[07:18] <wayland76> I'm trying to replicate the features of the DOM, but not the API

[07:18] <wayland76> Ok, I'll read about it

[07:19] <masak> hold on, I'll find the links for you.

[07:19] <wayland76> Well, google gets me to github and use perl

[07:20] *** donaldh left
[07:20] <masak> sounds about right.

[07:20] *** donaldh joined
[07:21] <moritz_> sounds like the typical masak++ locations ;-)

[07:21] <masak> :)

[07:21] <missingthepoint> wayland76: nope, original breaks too: "Unable to parse comment, couldn't find final '-->'"

[07:21] <moritz_> bah, it seems I was again removed from the ironman feed

[07:21] <masak> wayland76: so, these two: http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39224 http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39351

[07:21] <moritz_> and nobody bothedred to tell me

[07:21] <missingthepoint> wayland76: (after you remove that extraneous ':')

[07:21] <wayland76> Yeah, I got rid of the : too

[07:22] <wayland76> masak: XPath is great, but not good enough :)

[07:22] <wayland76> masak: Sounds like we should pool our efforts

[07:23] <masak> wayland76: yes.

[07:23] <wayland76> If we can agree on how to do things

[07:23] <wayland76> Should we take this to #november-wiki ?

[07:23] <masak> wayland76: re 'good enough', both XPath and CSS are great for searching for DOM nodes in some projects.

[07:23] <masak> wayland76: re #november-wiki, not necessarily.

[07:24] <wayland76> ok, will remain here if you prefer

[07:24] <masak> Grampa is kinda in the borderland between Web.pm and non-Web.pm...

[07:24] <wayland76> The changes I want to XPath are:

[07:24] <wayland76> a) Supports Perl6 inside [] instead of XPath-language

[07:24] <wayland76> b) Supports other kinds of trees, including overlapping and multiple perspectives

[07:25] <moritz_> what are overlapping trees?

[07:25] <masak> I was kinda aiming for a pure XPath implementation.

[07:25] <wayland76> masak: Yeah, I figured.  But we could probably use the same backend model

[07:26] <masak> wayland76: yes, that's fairly likely.

[07:26] <wayland76> moritz_: Imagine you want to XML a Shakespeare play

[07:26] <moritz_> well, wayland76 can still inherit from the grammar, and override where neccessary

[07:26] <wayland76> And you want the XML to mark all the line beginnings and ends with open and close tags

[07:26] <wayland76> And you also want to mark the speech of the different characters with open and close tags

[07:27] <wayland76> but XML says ENO-CAN-DO

[07:27] <moritz_> why not?

[07:27] <wayland76> But if you had a language where that was allowed, then you'd have a "lines" perspective, and a "characters" perspective

[07:28] <moritz_> then it's not a tree anymore

[07:28] <moritz_> but a graph

[07:28] <wayland76> Yes, a graph

[07:28] <moritz_> a more generic graph

[07:28] <wayland76> Exactly

[07:28] <moritz_> ok

[07:28] <moritz_> then I was just confused by the word "tree"

[07:28] <wayland76> I also want to support sloftlinks/hardlinks, a la filesystems

[07:29] <wayland76> My problem is, to the non-mathematical programmer, "graph" means "picture chart thing", and "tree" means "graph" :)

[07:29] <Matt-W> Morning

[07:29] <wayland76> SO I call it "tree", just like filesystems do

[07:30] <wayland76> masak: So shall I create a github project for all this tree stuff?

[07:31] <masak> wayland76: I doubt I'll have any tuits for it in the coming week, but yes, sure.

[07:33] <wayland76> masak: Would you have enough of a tuit to upload what you have so far on the XML stuff?

[07:33] <masak> wayland76: that's already uploaded, in the grampa repo.

[07:34] <masak> or did you have some other XML stuff in mind?

[07:34] <wayland76> No, I think that's what I meant

[07:34] <wayland76> Anyway, I'll upload what I have, and since I've also started doing XML, we'll have to merge them together (unless one, probably yours, is obviously superior :) )

[07:37] <masak> I don't recall doing much XML parsing in Grampa, so maybe there's nothing to merge from my side right now.

[07:37] <masak> I think I only did Match traversal so far.

[07:37] <wayland76> moritz_: I'm not intending to do more than just start with XPath, because if I'm going to change it that much anyway, I might as well just revamp the whole thing with Unicode operators, etc :)

[07:38] <wayland76> masak: Ok, it sounds like we have slightly different projects then

[07:38] <wayland76> I'm trying to do XML -> Tree objects

[07:38] <wayland76> You're trying to do generic grammar -> Tree objects, if I understand correctly

[07:38] <wayland76> Which is probably a worthier goal :)

[07:39] <masak> wayland76: well, I started wanting to be able to traverse/search Match trees.

[07:39] <masak> wayland76: but then, somehow, the idea of doing the same to DOM trees got mixed in.

[07:40] <wayland76> ok :)

[07:40] <masak> I'm still not 100% certain these two kinds of tree can be brought under the same model.

[07:40] <wayland76> Well, then, it's not a big enouhg model :)

[07:40] <masak> what, for example, is the DOM equivalent of $/[0]?

[07:41] *** payload joined
[07:41] <wayland76> Maybe there isn't one

[07:41] <wayland76> But the Tree model should allow for it, and the DOM implementation can throw a "not implementable" :)

[07:41] <masak> then, almost by definition, I couldn't use XPath to find $/[0].

[07:42] <wayland76> Ok, so that's why we need TreePath :)

[07:42] <masak> that was the original goal of Grampa; to use XPath to find Match objects in a Match tree.

[07:42] <wayland76> Ok, so what *exactly* is $/[0]

[07:42] <wayland76> Is it the whole text of the match?

[07:43] <masak> no, it's a Match object.

[07:43] <wayland76> (I'm trying to debug two things at once here :) )

[07:43] <wayland76> Ah, yes, of course

[07:43] <masak> rakudo: "foobarbaz" ~~ /foo(bar)baz/; say ~$/[0]

[07:43] <p6eval> rakudo a53a1c: OUTPUT¬´bar‚ê§¬ª

[07:44] <wayland76> Got it

[07:44] <masak> wayland76: with all due respect to your TreePath, I think being able to use XPath here would be a really good thing. it's not a place where I feel an entirely new standard would be warranted.

[07:44] <wayland76> I'd say that anything that accesses a match via [] should be considered a child node

[07:45] <wayland76> whereas anything that accesses via {} should be considered an attribute

[07:45] <masak> wayland76: that doesn't cut it.

[07:45] <wayland76> masak: We differ on that, but that doesn't prevent us using the same backend Tree model.  We can do both, and see what works :)

[07:46] <wayland76> masak: Yeah, I think you're probably right :)

[07:46] <masak> attributes aren't flexible enough to hold whole Match objects. they need to be child nodes.

[07:46] <wayland76> (about my idea not cutting it)

[07:46] <masak> so both kinds need to be child nodes.

[07:46] <wayland76> Have you noticed that in the DOM, XML::Attribute inherits from XML::Node?

[07:47] <wayland76> So attributes are nodes, but not child nodes

[07:47] <wayland76> (unless I'm confused again)

[07:47] <masak> indeed.

[07:47] <masak> that's slightly noticeable in XPath, too.

[07:47] *** kane_ joined
[07:48] <wayland76> Ok, let me ask this question

[07:48] <wayland76> No, I won't :)

[07:49] <Matt-W> XML in some senses makes little distinction between attributes and child nodes

[07:49] <wayland76> Anyway, I vote we try to work on it, and see what we come up with

[07:49] <Matt-W> the only real difference seems to be what you can put in them...

[07:50] <wayland76> Matt-W: That's what I was too inarticulate to say :)

[07:50] <Matt-W> well it must be getting late in australia

[07:51] <wayland76> And since XPath doesn't (AFAIK) seem to care what you put in them (only the XML standard does, maybe?), then using the idea I had might actually work in an evil twisted sort of way :)

[07:51] <wayland76> Matt-W: All of 5:51pm :)

[07:51] <Matt-W> yeah, so it's late :P

[07:52] <masak> wayland76: I appreciate all collaboration proposals I get, so yes, let's try it together.

[07:52] <wayland76> I'll probably be afk food soon, but I'll try to get the stuff I have onto github

[07:53] <wayland76> Oh, another thing that I don't like about XPath -- the axes are insufficient :)

[07:54] <wayland76> But the Axes I have in mind are such that the XPath axes could be mapped onto them with trivial effort

[07:55] <masak> be that as it may -- my needs call for faithful XPath.

[07:56] <wayland76> Oh, of course.  I'm glad someone's doing XPath, and I support you in your idea.  It's just not what I want for myself :)

[07:58] <wayland76> masak: Just about every sizeable P6 project I have is currently blocking on this Tree stuff :)

[08:04] <masak> whether it should flag an error is another thing.

[08:10] <JimmyZ> should I say  it is unlike python?

[08:10] <JimmyZ> poor english

[08:12] <moritz_> yes, I think "it is unlike python" works

[08:12] <Matt-W> it does indeed work

[08:12] <Matt-W> it is in fact a very ordinary way to say it

[08:12] <Matt-W> you can also say 'it is not like python'

[08:13] <Matt-W> English, you see, is like Perl 6.

[08:13] <JimmyZ> masak: good, we alawys mix the grammar in english and you always mix the tone in chinese. :(

[08:14] <moritz_> right, in perl 6 you can say 'perl' !~~ 'python', and it means 'unlike' :-)

[08:14] <moritz_> or you can say   not 'perl' ~~ 'python', which would be 'not like'

[08:24] <masak> so, "ËØ¥‰∏Ä‰∏™Á¨ëËØù"?

[08:24] <xinming_> I'm a more advanced turing machine. :-)

[08:24] <xinming_> masak: I believe you mean "tell a joke" really.

[08:24] <masak> xinming_: indeed.

[08:25] <xinming_> tell, or, speak should be    ËØ¥

[08:25] <masak> right.

[08:25] <masak> makes sense.

[08:31] <xinming_> masak: Yes.

[08:31] <masak> good to know.

[08:33] <xinming_> BTW, But If you really want to emphisis the joke is "made",  You can use,   "Áºñ‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∏™Á¨ëËØù", Here, Áºñ contains the meaning of "make", But It doesn't necessary to mean that you've told people what the joke is.

[08:33] <xinming_> Ok, let's give up, It's #perl6 channel. :-)

[08:34] <masak> thanks for the info. it's well received.

[09:20] <masak> JimmyZ: after that, the Pod errors you refer to are in docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Containers.pod and docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Callable.pod

[09:24] <JimmyZ> thanks, I had alrealdy taken a look at there.

[09:36] <missingthepoint> is there an actual roadmap document somewhere?

[09:36] <missingthepoint> (for rakudo)

[09:37] <masak> missingthepoint: yes. docs/ROADMAP

[09:37] <missingthepoint> hmm, my ack-fu needs work

[09:37] <missingthepoint> sorry

[09:37] <masak> no problem.

[09:37] <masak> if pmichaud were here, he'd mumble about "no-one ever looks in the docs/ directory" or something. :)

[09:38] <missingthepoint> he'd probably be right, too :)

[09:38] <masak> yes, it's strange how that works.

[09:38] <masak> I had pored over large parts of the Rakudo source code before I even became aware of the docs/ dir...

[09:39] <moritz_> maybe we should name it FUCKING-READ-THE-docs-DIR

[09:40] <masak> I dunno, I'm old-skool and believe in a polite kind of proffessionalism. but maybe that's just me.

[09:40] <masak> s/ff/f/

[09:40] <wayland76> ffl <-- font ligatures test :)

[09:41] <wayland76> The ROADMAP claims to be a few months old, but not much has changed, if I understand correctly

[09:41] <missingthepoint> wayland76: ok, cool.

[09:41] <wayland76> The stuff that said it would be in the July release wasn't, but Allison claims it's now her top priority

[09:41] <missingthepoint> and i think i have a bug in windows ack.

[09:42] <wayland76> I tried ack, but I tend to avoid it after getting bitten once or twice by it ignoring directories I didn't want it to

[09:43] <wayland76> Or was that files?  I forget, but I know I like to have it when i need a Perl Regex :)

[09:44] <masak> yes, it ignores some directories.

[09:44] <masak> and files.

[09:44] <missingthepoint> (in this case, those files without an extension)

[09:44] <missingthepoint> petdance, where are youuuuu?

[09:45] <wayland76> That was probably what I hated :)

[09:45] <missingthepoint> petdance++ because in 1-2 years of use this is the first problem i've had.

[09:46] <missingthepoint> wayland76: i've never had trouble with it under linux...

[09:47] *** Su-Shee left
[09:48] <masak> it (ack) at least sets the bar higher than grep, which is a good thing in itself.

[09:48] *** zamolxes joined
[09:49] <wayland76> Someday I'll learn to configure it the way I want, I guess, but until then, I'll default to grep :)

[09:49] <masak> grep is ubiquitous, which is an advantage.

[09:49] <masak> and it's also quite powerful, once one learns its quirks.

[09:49] <wayland76> Although I've been bitten by the flavouring of grep before :)

[09:50] <wayland76> (ie. Solaris grep is different to GNU grep :) )

[09:51] <JimmyZ> q: Is there any roadmap to make perl6 compile itself?

[09:51] <masak> JimmyZ: perl6 is a specification, not an implementation.

[09:52] <masak> JimmyZ: but yes, this is the goal of e.g. the Elf implementation.

[09:52] <JimmyZ> and  rakudo Ôºü

[09:52] <masak> JimmyZ: Rakudo will probably always have Parrot-specific parts.

[09:53] <masak> that's my guess, anyway.

[09:54] <jnthn> I think it's fair to say Rakudo doesn't have short or medium term plans for being self-hosting.

[09:55] <wayland76> ooh, jnthn is here :)

[09:55] <masak> that makes it sound like there are long term plans. :)

[09:56] <JimmyZ> some idealismer always wants Perl 6 for self-hosting

[09:56] <JimmyZ> if not, they will be sad

[09:56] <moritz_> it already has the grammar, action methods and the setting written in Perl 6

[09:56] <moritz_> IMHO that's a fair start

[09:56] <jnthn> moritz_: Indeed.

[09:57] <wayland76> jnthn: Have you seen http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68066 yet?

[09:57] <jnthn> wayland76: I hadn't, but I'm not surprised either.

[09:57] <jnthn> wayland76: Pre-declaring classes doesn't work afaik.

[09:58] <wayland76> Should it, though?

[09:58] <jnthn> wayland76: It parses it as nothing more special than a role whose body is ....

[09:58] <wayland76> Yeah, I figured :)

[09:58] <jnthn> It should work in the sense that yes, it's Perl 6 spec.

[09:58] <wayland76> That's what I was asking :)

[09:58] <moritz_> std: class A { ... }; class A { method foo { } }

[09:59] <wayland76> Works for roles, though :)

[09:59] <jnthn> I suspect the first of those is a std bug.

[09:59] <jnthn> Sure, but roles are kinda more fun.

[09:59] <jnthn> Since you can declare multiple of them with the same name.

[09:59] <jnthn> So long as they take a distinguishable parameter signature.

[10:00] <wayland76> What, to the .new() method, or do I need to read more doco? :)

[10:01] <jnthn> wayland76: To the role.

[10:02] <wayland76> Ah, I see the section in S14 now :)

[10:03] <jnthn> rakudo: role Can[::T] { method fill(::S $stuff) { if $stuff !~~ T { say "you can not fill a can of {T.perl} with {S.perl}!" } }; class Beer { }; class Water { }; my Can of Beer $starobrno = Can[Beer].new(); $starobrno.fill(Water.new);

[10:04] <moritz_> masak: \o|

[10:04] <masak> jnthn++

[10:05] <wayland76> Hmm.  Not sure whether that will help me, but maybe I can fool the compiler that way :)

[10:05] <masak> jnthn: that example, more than anything I've seen so far, makes me realize what to use parameterized roles for.

[10:06] <jnthn> masak: Erm.

[10:07] <jnthn> masak: You're making me think that silly example should go in my talk now.

[10:07] <jnthn> :-)

[10:07] <masak> jnthn: I'm just saying to worked very well for me.

[10:07] <wayland76> Is implementing predeclaration of roles as simple as doing something like "if body = '...' then whatever" ???

[10:07] <masak> I've already seen your other param-roles examples.

[10:08] <jnthn> wayland76: Well, maybe something along those lines. The whatever bit is the harder part. ;-)

[10:08] <wayland76> Ok :)

[10:08] <jnthn> It's relatively low-hanging fruit though.

[10:09] <wayland76> Lets just overload the * operator to do it :)

[10:09] <masak> how would that help, even in the context of a joke?

[10:10] <wayland76> Isn't it called the "whatever" operator? :)

[10:10] <jnthn> Gah, why do I find the syntax for iptables impossible to commit to memory...

[10:10] <masak> wayland76: oh, I was confused by you calling it an operator. :)

[10:10] <wayland76> Because it's a pain? :)

[10:11] <moritz_> it's a term, actually

[10:11] <wayland76> jnthn: That example in the bug I submitted works as long as you don't call .new()  Is that a bug?  Should it only work if one of the roles is parameterised?

[10:12] *** wknight8111 left
[10:12] <masak> wayland76: as far as I understand, all roles are parametereized.

[10:12] <jnthn> wayland76: All roles are "parameterized" in a sense.

[10:12] <wayland76> Sorry, let me rephrase that

[10:12] <masak> though they may be parameterized with zero parameters.

[10:12] <jnthn> role Foo { } is really the same as role Foo[] { }

[10:13] <jnthn> As in, *really* the same.

[10:13] <wayland76> Should it only work if the roles have different sigs?

[10:13] <jnthn> Well, it's built on multiple dispatch.

[10:13] <jnthn> So the rules for conflicts are the same.

[10:14] <moritz_> detecting if two sigs are always identical is turing complete

[10:15] <moritz_> so in general you can't know if there'll be an ambiguous dispatch unless you try it

[10:16] <jnthn> moritz_: Right.

[10:16] <jnthn> Which is the rule for multiple dispatch. :-)

[10:16] <moritz_> rakudo: role A[Int $x where { $x % 2 == 0 }] { method s { 'even' } }; role A[Int $x where{ $x % 2 == 1 }] { method s { 'odd' } }; class X does A[5]; say X.new.s

[10:17] <masak> wow, that's a new one.

[10:18] <masak> also, I look forward to the day when closures stringify correctly.

[10:18] * jnthn inserted that check hoping it'd never actually happen.

[10:20] <masak> good thing you didn't name it 'ThisShouldNeverHappenError' or something. :)

[10:20] * masak has done something in that vein once

[10:20] <moritz_> jnthn: you should have known us better ;-)

[10:21] <masak> #perl6: helping torment the implementors since 2005.

[10:21] <jnthn> Well, I'd much rather having the implementation flagging up that something has probably gone very wrong than silently appearing to work.

[10:21] <jnthn> Then doing something that'd be *very* hard to trace/debug later.

[10:21] <literal> http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2009/07/miracle-of-become.html

[10:22] <literal> does Perl 6 do this?

[10:22] *** eMaX joined
[10:22] <jnthn> Is that just not assignment to self?

[10:23] <wayland76> jnthn: Where should the merging of the two roles be done?  Should it be done during the first dispatch, or during !add_variant, or what?

[10:23] <jnthn> method foo($self is rw:) { $self = OtherThingy.new }

[10:23] <jnthn> wayland76: Oh, it *shuld* be an ambiguous dispatch.

[10:23] <jnthn> wayland76: They shouldn't get silently merged, just as different multi candidates should not.

[10:24] <jnthn> wayland76: The problem is that something triggered a sanity check that we should never trigger.

[10:24] <wayland76> Err, I'm talking about the predeclaration one.  Are you talking about that too?

[10:24] <jnthn> No :-)

[10:24] <wayland76> Ah, no, you're talking about moritz_'s one

[10:24] *** icwiener joined
[10:25] <wayland76> Ok, can you re-read the question, assuming it's about the predeclaration one? :)

[10:25] <jnthn> eek, I got a meet-up with my slovak language parter that I gotta head off too!

[10:25] <jnthn> nearly forgot that...

[10:26] <wayland76> ok, sorry

[10:26] <jnthn> wayland76: I suspect we should detect it, but not emit a role body or something.

[10:26] <jnthn> Just create a Perl6Role and install it in the namespace but at that point it has no candidates.

[10:26] <jnthn> That is, if there isn't one there already.

[10:27] <wayland76> Ok, that sounds reasonable.  I'll see if I can find the time to learn enough about Rakudo to understand what needs doing, even if I can't solve it :)

[15:30] <PerlJam> moritz_: you've got a commit bit to perl6-docs now. :)

[15:31] <PerlJam> @tell Su-Shee The difference between perl-docs and u4x is that perl6-docs doesn't aim to be documentation for perl6 as much as just documents about perl 6.  They may merge at some point though.

[15:31] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[15:32] *** hercynium left
[15:33] <masak> PerlJam: ah, good to know. I was wondering about that, too.

[15:35] <PerlJam> at least in my head, u4x is to comprehensive documentation while perl6-docs is almost explicitly NOT comprehensive :)

[15:35] <PerlJam> s/to/to be/

[15:36] <masak> sounds about right.

[15:37] <PerlJam> (perhaps the naming is unfortunate though)

[15:37] <masak> not necessarily.

[15:37] <masak> maybe perl6-docs can handle the 'tutorials' part of Perl 6 documentation.

[15:37] <PerlJam> masak: that's the idea :)

[15:37] <masak> excellent. I'm not really interested in having that in u4x right now anyway.

[16:47] <masak> pmichaud: me too. I'll try walking there tonight, so I won't have worry about finding the way there tomorrow.

[16:47] <pmichaud> is it in the same location as the conference?

[16:48] <masak> another building, but same location.

[16:48] <pmichaud> okay

[16:48] <TimToady> we were thinking of walking up there soon

[16:48] <masak> me too.

[16:48] <pmichaud> my hotel (radisson) appears to be very close to the conference venue so getting there shouldn't be much of a problem

[16:48] <masak> I'm about 1 hour away by foot.

[16:49] <pmichaud> right now I'm "stuck" at EWR for the next seven hours waiting for my next flight :-)

[16:49] <masak> it'll make a nice late-afternoon walk.

[16:49] <masak> pmichaud: bet you're glad you have git. :)

[16:49] <pmichaud> well, wifi here seems to be pretty nice so far

[16:49] <pmichaud> but yes, I'm glad for git

[16:50] <pmichaud> I'm trying to decide if I should (1) goof off, (2) work on PGE, (3) work on Rakudo REPL, (4) write my talk slides

[16:50] *** M_o_C joined
[16:51] <masak> those all sound nice to me. :)

[16:51] <masak> do they all take seven hours?

[16:51] <pmichaud> No.

[16:51] <pmichaud> Write my talk slides will take about five minutes.  :-P

[16:51] <masak> I wish I could say the same.

[16:51] <pmichaud> Yes! Yes!  I'm actually going to a conference where I have my slides written before I arrive!!

[16:52] <pmichaud> of course, I'm just re-using my oscon talk....

[16:52] <pmichaud> and I'm thinking about changing a couple of items

[16:56] <TimToady> yeah, prolly doesn't make sense

[16:57] <masak> if I read Google Maps right, there are four Hotels named Alif in town. :)

[17:06] <pmichaud> Except for Perl 5.  Perl 6 is *nothing* like Perl 5.

[17:06] <pmichaud> :-D

[17:06] <Juerd> I still don't get why say is a method, by the way.

[17:06] <JimmyZ> I meant the Perl 6 object system.

[17:06] <Juerd> Is this explained somewhere?

[17:07] <pmichaud> I find using .say as a method to be very convenient, personally.

[17:07] <[particle]> Ook. Ook.

[17:07] <JimmyZ> pmichaud: me too.

[17:07] <Juerd> pmichaud: That could be a very good reason by itself but I was wondering if there was more to it :)

[17:07] <pmichaud> sometimes we want to put what we're doing at the front     say "hello".uc

[17:07] <Juerd> If somehow it would make sense, be the logical thing to do.

[17:34] <masak> hm. not as much, no. I wouldn't be bothered by it, but I don't see the need as much.

[17:34] <PerlJam> on Any? or Object? or what?

[17:34] <masak> well, same as .say :)

[17:34] <TimToady> if people will get frustrated by it not being there, why not?

[17:34] <pmichaud> I ask because 'warn' is closer to 'fail' or 'return' than to 'say'

[17:35] <masak> all I know for sure so far is I expected .warn to be there and it wasn't. so far that hasn't happened with .fail and .return.

[17:35] <TimToady> "Any" verbs are just bits of the language that we havent' baked in as keywords

[17:35] <pmichaud> I have no strong opposition to .warn, fwiw.

[17:36] <pmichaud> afk for a bit (ice cream, power)

[17:36] <TimToady> I think well just need to take it on a case-by-case basis, but most of the common IO ones seem like a set

[17:36] <TimToady> and warn does IO :)

[17:37] <PerlJam> .fail too?  It *maybe* does IO.  

[17:38] <TimToady> then we *maybe* put it into Any :P

[17:38] <masak> worksforme :)

[21:14] <p6eval> rakudo e02bc0: OUTPUT¬´Could not find non-existent sub caller‚ê§¬ª

[21:16] <wolverian> finding a non-existent sub would be even more surprising

[21:16] <Tene> tann: can you point me to the 'caller' spec?

[21:17] <Tene> also, are you wanting that feature for something specific?

[21:17] <tann> Tene: give me a min..i'll look it up for you .. and yes, i really need it so i plan to say caller.perl on #perl6 the first thing after each login :)

[21:18] <Tene> tann: what do you need it for, btw?

[21:18] <tann> tene: porting Benchmark.pm to p6 :)

[21:19] <Tene> Hmm.  I don't see 'caller' used in the Benchmark.pm on cpan.

[21:19] <japhb_> Why did PerlJam's rakudo: ''.^methods.map(*.name).grep(/^p/).sort.join(" ").say produce two copies of 'perl'?

[21:19] <tann> tene: http://perlcabal.org/syn/S06.html#The_context_and_caller_functions

[21:19] *** japhb_ is now known as japhb

[21:20] <Tene> tann: that is, can you show me exactly what you'd need to do with caller() ?

[21:20] <PerlJam> japhb: because there are two .perl methods in the inheritance tree.

[21:22] <tann> tene: it's in the doc of Benchmark 

[21:22] <PerlJam> (I don't know if there's a way to get the "fully qualified name" of a method, but that would be nice)

[21:22] <tann> tene: for timeit and timethis

[21:23] <PerlJam> tann: http://github.com/perlpilot/benchmark/tree/master

[21:23] <PerlJam> tann: there are other versions I'm sure :)

[21:23] <PerlJam> (no, mine doesn't do anything with caller)

[21:23] <tann> PerlJam: that's a super simple example :)

[21:23] <Tene> so how are you going to use caller() to run code in the caller's package?

[21:24] <PerlJam> probably with an eval just like Benchmark.pm does.

[21:25] <PerlJam> AFAIK, Benchmark just uses caller() to get the name of the package and then does an eval "package $name; ..."

[21:25] <tann> tene: it searches for the name of the caller's package and then eval the whole thing in a string

[21:25] <Tene> 'kay

[21:26] <lisppaste3> tann pasted "untitled" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/84534

[21:26] <tann> PerlJam: yes

[21:26] *** JE|2|2Y joined
[21:27] <tann> PerlJam: at least 99% :)

[21:27] <PerlJam> tann: I was thinking of separating the benchmarking from the presentation.  Seems weird to have them so tightly coupled.

[21:27] <tann> PerlJam: i can move the doc down to the bottom

[21:27] <tann> PerlJam: i hate pod stuff intertwining with code too

[21:28] <JE|2|2Y> eval: 2+2

[21:28] <JE|2|2Y> Oo

[21:28] <PerlJam> that too, but I was talking about how the output routines are "intertwined" with the code that does the benchmarking.  :)

[21:28] <tann> tene: this is the part of eval'ing code in the caller's package http://paste.lisp.org/display/84534

[21:29] <tann> PerlJam: gotcha

[21:29] <tann> PerlJam: agree, it's ugly

[21:30] <tann> PerlJam: but the initial intention is just a faithful translation to p6 so that i can benchmark new shiny p6's stuff with old code :)

[21:31] <PerlJam> tann++  

[21:32] <PerlJam> (I'm easily distracted, so I never got beyond timing)

[21:32] <tann> PerlJam: i'm interested in the jamming part of rakudo perl :)

[21:34] <PerlJam> Someone (cotto?) is working on profiling PIR at the subroutine level.  It'll be interesting to see which routines are most important to rakudo.

[21:53] <masak> why is everyone writing XML grammars? :)

[21:53] <masak> can't we collaborate on hooking in libxml or Expat instead?

[21:54] *** maja left
[21:54] <masak> yah, saw the emails about it.

[21:54] <japhb> Writing an XML grammar is fun, and makes sure we didn't miss some obvious hump in the waterbed, but there's no way we're going to compete with libxml.

[21:54] <masak> 'xactly.

[21:54] <japhb> (And we have much bigger mountains to climb.)

[21:55] <masak> and we need all the speedups we can get.

[22:06] <Tene> japhb, masak: I agree too, fwiw

[22:06] <japhb> I think it will be a horrendous mistake if we get all purist with default Parrot, and then every HLL decides that they need to provide their own batteries.  From Elbonia.  That leak.  A lot.

[22:06] <japhb> And catch on fire.

[22:07] *** minskman left
[22:07] *** minskman joined
[22:08] <pmurias> japhb: i think the reason is to avoid the perl5 situation with dual-life modules

[22:08] <japhb> pmurias: Sure, that's fair.  But I think dual-life modules are VASTLY less likely when the core iterates monthly.

[22:08] <Tene> I have been thinking about the idea of a separate parrot repository, just holding libraries.

[22:10] <pmurias> japhb: what do you advocate putting modules in core or having the default distro contain them?

[22:11] <japhb> Did you mean 'Why'?

[22:11] <japhb> Or do you mean two options to choose from?

[22:12] <pmurias> if you treat modules as part of the core they will have to be treated with the sort of backward compability the rest of parrot is

[22:13] <japhb> I'm fine with the default distro containing most of the modules that I think should be included.  (I think the barebones version is a good idea but should NOT be default.)  But I think there are probably a small number of modules that really need to be core, there even in a barebones distro -- those that are required to get access to (and effectively use) the module repository.

[22:14] <japhb> And frankly, I think Parrot's deprecation scale of 6 months is about right -- since many of the higher level libraries release every six months, and several major distros do as well.

[22:15] <pmurias> that's mostly common sense

[22:15] <japhb> Thank you for the complement.  ;-)

[22:53] <pmichaud> s1n: I'm here, for a bit

[22:53] <pmichaud> (flight is delayed)

[22:53] <s1n> pmichaud: lemme go get my paperwork real fast

[22:54] <pmichaud> (included modules) -- one of the things I've been realizing by watching the p5 process is that testing+maintaining modules is currently more than a single release manager can handle.

[22:54] <s1n> pmichaud: is rakudo under artistic 2.0? have a link to the CLA for rakudo?

[22:55] <pmichaud> http://www.perlfoundation.org/contributor_license_agreement

[22:55] <pmichaud> Rakudo is under artistic 2.0, yes.

[22:55] <pmichaud> http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/LICENSE

[22:56] <s1n> pmichaud: what about sponsors?

[22:56] <pmichaud> ...sponsors?

[22:56] <s1n> commercial sponsors

[22:56] <pmichaud> for Rakudo?

[22:56] <s1n> only indirectly through TPF?

[22:56] * pmichaud is confused

[22:57] <japhb> pmichaud: P5 ships a LOT more modules in core than I'm even dreaming of, it doesn't have the massive advantage of Parrot's monthly release cycle, and it has to deal with dual-life modules, which I honestly think will be far less likely for Parrot (because of the module-friendly release and deprecation cycles)

[22:57] <pmichaud> japhb: I'm not so certain of that.

[22:57] <pmichaud> japhb: I'm not saying you're wrong; I'm just saying that the p5 lesson is very cautionary.

[22:57] <japhb> pmichaud: fair enough.

[22:58] <pmichaud> I think it's important that modules be able to live on release cycles that are separate from the core language.

[22:58] <s1n> pmichaud: i need to list companies that sponsor the community, if that's indirectly though TPF, then i'll list that

[22:58] <pmichaud> it'd be through TPF, yes.

[22:58] <s1n> pmichaud: no sponsorship from TPaF?

[22:59] <pmichaud> to the extent that the core decides to include a module as part of the core, it subsumes that module's release cycle

[22:59] <pmichaud> s1n:  Rakudo is owned by TPF.  PaFo may be doing things that help support Rakudo but I don't know that it's direct support.

[22:59] <pmichaud> s1n:  Allison Randal would be the best person to ask about it, though.

[23:00] <japhb> pmichaud: I think this is why the "true core" module set should be very small.  But to make the "batteries included" release easy, it may be worth having the modules freeze a few days before the release.

[23:00] <japhb> .. or instead of freeze, branch.  Whatever.

[23:00] <pmichaud> I'm currently leaning that it's better if "batteries included" releases are separate from core releases.

[23:01] <pmichaud> even to the extent of having different release managers.

[23:01] <japhb> Interesting idea, and at least the "different release managers" idea sounds quite good.

[23:01] <pmichaud> It's basically the way distros work in the Linux world.  Distro releases are separate from core kernel releases.

[23:02] <s1n> pmichaud: lastly, i thought about hosting a rakudo sprint the weekend after dallas.p6m

[23:02] <japhb> What do you think of my point about trying to avoid HLL implementors all reimplementing their own batteries, because they perceive a "default" parrot that is too bare-bones?

[23:02] *** SmokeMachine left
[23:02] <pmichaud> I would think that an HLL implementor would choose a batteries-included release of parrot over a core one.

[23:02] <japhb> I guess we could simply call the two releases "Parrot Core" and "Parrot Standard"

[23:03] <pmichaud> I'm even going so far as to say there shouldn't be "Parrot Standard"

[23:03] <pmichaud> "Parrot Core", and then "Parrot Batteries 1", "Parrot Batteries 2", "Parrot Batteries 3", etc.

[23:03] * japhb is a big believer that we need to be conscious of how our naming and presentation subconsciously pushes on users and HLL implementers

[23:04] <pmichaud> any time we start talking about "*the* distribution" instead of "*a* distribution", we're likely to run into trouble.

[23:04] <japhb> pmichaud: sort of a vanilla/strawberry/chocolate analog?

[23:04] <japhb> s/analog/analogue/

[23:04] <pmichaud> s1n:  I'll be gone the weekend after dallas.p6m

[23:05] <pmichaud> s1n:  you're welcome to have a rakudo sprint, but I won't be able to make it :-|

[23:05] <japhb> If we get too fine-grained, though, we risk people shooting for the lowest common denominator, because for instance Debian ships PB3, and Fedora ships PB2, and OpenBSD ships PC.

[23:06] <pmichaud> japhb: does that sort of thing happen now?

[23:06] <japhb> pmichaud: I would argue that's why people still program to Perl 5.6, let alone 5.8.

[23:06] <s1n> pmichaud: i might want to get with you prior to talk about it then

[23:07] <pmichaud> s1n: okay.  I'll be at dallas.p6m, though

[23:07] <japhb> If we don't send a clear message about the blessed standard, everyone will pick a different standard, and the end users lose.

[23:07] <pmichaud> I can even give my lightning talk that I did at oscon about Perl 6 meta operators :-)

[23:07] <pmichaud> japhb: "blessed standard" is the problem that p5 ran into, though.

[23:07] <s1n> pmichaud: sounds like a good idea

[23:07] <japhb> pmichaud: I'm not sure what you mean by that.

[23:08] <s1n> pmichaud: lemme know where your slides are, i'm sending out the notice next week

[23:08] <pmichaud> s1n:  http://pmichaud.com/2009/pres/oscon-perl6op

[23:08] <pmichaud> s1n:  although I'm thinking I'll write it up as a use.perl post.  (Perhaps on the plane tonight.)

[23:08] <s1n> pmichaud: okay, if you do that, let me know

[23:09] <pmichaud> japhb: As soon as there's a "blessed standard", everyone wants his/her favorite module to be included in the "blessed standard"

[23:09] <s1n> i think i finally got my tuits back

[23:09] <japhb> pmichaud: I see what you're getting at.

[23:09] <pmichaud> if they succeed, then they've turned over the maintenance responsibility to the "blessed standard" maintainer

[23:10] <pmichaud> if they fail, then they feel that they're excluded from being part of the standard

[23:10] <japhb> pmichaud: Hmmm.

[23:10] * japhb tanking on that thought

[23:10] *** meppl joined
[23:10] <pmichaud> true growth comes from a marketplace of ideas, and "competition" helps to fuel that marketplace.  Survival of the fittest, and all that.

[23:11] <s1n> or survival of the longest maintained (see EU::MM)

[23:11] <pmichaud> I think it's also a mistake to assume that a single standard can meet the needs of all audiences/clients

[23:11] <japhb> pmichaud: No argument.  I guess my mental image of the standard modules mostly comes from things that people have already discussed to death in a bazillion forums, and have actually managed to agree on, for several years running.

[23:11] <pmichaud> s1n: yes, that's really true.  Because there's "one blessed standard", it's not possible to create a competing standard that eliminates EU::MM

[23:13] <s1n> pmichaud: i have to leave, i want to run more specifics of the sprint by you to see what you think (i've never hosted one); free beer at my place if you really want to discuss it in meatspace

[23:13] <pmichaud> so, I think "with batteries" is a good idea; I just am not sure that we should be thinking in terms of "standard with batteries"

[23:13] <japhb> pmichaud: Unfortunately, EU::MM is a special case, because it's part of the core set for contributors -- modules needed to write to CPAN, as opposed to the modules needed to read from it.  At some point in the distant past, something had to be reliably available for that task.

[23:13] <pmichaud> s1n: this week I'm in lisbon- I get back next friday

[23:13] <s1n> pmichaud: or "these batteries are the standard batteries"

[23:14] <s1n> pmichaud: that's fine, dallas.p6m is on the 10th

[23:15] <japhb> pmichaud: is the real problem on the Perl 5 side the fear of following through with deprecations of the modules?

[23:15] <pmichaud> japhb: I have a feeling that's only one of the problems

[23:15] * s1n dinner&

[23:16] <japhb> I mean, if we have a set of standard modules that are deprecated and cleaned as reliably as Parrot seems to be doing, how much closer to the happy place are we?

[23:16] <japhb> s/doing/doing with core code/

[23:16] <pmichaud> I don't think that solves the "but I need my module to be part of the standard" problem

[23:17] <pmichaud> as an example, I'd be hard pressed to say that SDL should be a standard part of Parrot.

[23:18] <japhb> OK, so it work better in your mind if we're more mushy than "standard"?  Like "the usual suspects?"  Or "Best Practices <release number>"?

[23:18] <pmichaud> XML seems like a borderline case.  A DBDI interface seems like it ought to be standard.  SQLite... I'm not sure.

[23:18] <japhb> "Batteries 2.1"

[23:18] <japhb> ?

[23:18] <pmichaud> But for each of these modules I've mentioned, I can see someone making entirely different choices.

[23:19] <japhb> All right, how about four levels:

[23:19] <japhb> 1. True core.  Just what is needed to get read access to the module repo.

[23:20] <japhb> 2. Basic batteries.  The stuff everyone has hashed to death, agree on, and (like DBDI) forms a common layer through which other things are easy to plug in.

[23:20] <japhb> 3. Power pack.  What we currently think are the most common modules people would want.  Deprecated and cleaned regularly.

[23:20] <japhb> 4. Go use the module repo.

[23:20] <japhb> ?

[23:21] <japhb> In my mind, the Parrot release manager would be responsible only for #1.

[23:21] <pmichaud> well, first let me point out that we have the same sort of questions from a Rakudo perspective  (as in, "What exactly is the scope of 'Rakudo Perl'?")

[23:22] <pmichaud> I'd say that the Parrot project should only directly involve itself in #1 and #2.  And to the degree possible, #1 and #2 should be kept as separate as possible.

[23:22] <japhb> pmichaud: sure, though as I mentioned in another discussion, I think Parrot's decisions will end up wagging Rakudo's tail.

[23:22] <japhb> Fair enough.

[23:22] <pmichaud> Once we start getting to #3, I'd hope that we would be seeing "Power pack for Business", "Power pack for Scientists", "Power pack for hackers", etc.  (as examples)

[23:23] <japhb> I can see that.

[23:23] <pmichaud> even within "Power pack for business" there are likely to be a range of issues going from "I need the latest features" to "I need ultra stabilitity"

[23:24] <pmichaud> *stability

[23:24] <japhb> pmichaud: that seems like a place where the aforementioned market of ideas gets to battle it out.

[23:24] <pmichaud> exactly.

[23:24] <japhb> Anyone should be able to make power packs.

[23:24] <pmichaud> anyway, I know that Parrot will wag Rakudo's tail a bit.... but I also know that Rakudo will be wagging Parrot's tail a fair bit too :-)

[23:24] <japhb> OK, are we in general agreement at this point?

[23:24] <japhb> heh

[23:25] <pmichaud> indeed, it already does.  :-)

[23:25] *** ruz_mac left
[23:25] <pmichaud> japhb: it sounds like we have some agreement, yes.  To be honest, I've only really started to get an understanding of these issues in the past couple of weeks, so some of my ideas may not be too well-formed yet.

[23:26] <japhb> Oh sure.  But it feels to me like somehow now is the right time for this discussion.

[23:26] <pmichaud> so I don't claim to have all, or even most, of the answers.  I'm just trying to learn the lessons from other projects.

[23:26] <pmichaud> I fully agree this is a very good time for this discussion, especially as we're now starting to deal with packaging issues.
