[04:13] <s1n> how does submethod differ from using 'my method'?

[04:15] <dukeleto> can someone point me in the right direction regarding NCI with Rakudo/Parrot? Is there a document describing how to add bindings to a third-party library via NCI ?

[04:23] <bacek_> dukeleto: docs/pdds/draft/pdd16_native_call.pod in parrot

[04:23] <bacek_> dukeleto: also examples/nci in parrot can give some... erm.. examples :)

[04:26] <dukeleto> bacek: thanks, I didn't look in examples for some dumb reason ...

[04:29] <bacek_> dukeleto: what you are trying to bind?

[04:32] <dukeleto> bacek: Oh, I have lots of things in mind, but GSL is the first. It is a fairly large library, but I already have a large test suite in Perl 5 for Math::GSL that could be hijacked

[04:34] <bacek_> dukeleto: looks great.

[04:34] <dukeleto> i have made a new trac ticket at https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/ticket/531 to decide on a pilot/co-pilot for Parrot-related affairs this summer

[04:36] * bacek_ will never apply for this :)

[04:36] <dukeleto> bacek: thanks. if parrot had GSL bindings, than there is the possibility for any language using Parrot to get GSL bindings "for free.

[04:36] <bacek_> I've got enough manager's responsibility at $work...

[04:36] <dukeleto> bacek: yeah, just a general notice for the channel, wasn't directed at you or anything :)

[04:37] <dukeleto> that is pretty cool, since every dynamic language I know of that has GSL bindings put a lot of sweat, blood and tears into making it happen.

[04:38] <bacek_> ...one ring to bind them all... :)

[04:38] <dukeleto> exactly

[13:48] <moritz_> what's wrong with it?

[13:48] <moritz_> you declare explicitly that your block doesn't want a parameter

[13:49] <sbp> well, as I understand it -> { ... } means that $_ can be used much like $^a would be

[13:49] <moritz_> so it gets none

[13:49] <sbp> hmm

[13:49] <moritz_> no, that would be { ... } without the arrow in front

[13:52] <sbp> moritz_: if '-> { }' explicitly decares that the block doesn't want a parameter, how come $^a can be used therein? does $^a override the explicit declaration that you don't want parameters?

[14:20] <pmichaud> Parrot isn't able to throw an exception for zero-parameter functions.

[14:20] <pmichaud> I.e., if a sub is declared as having zero arguments, Parrot silently accepts multiple arguments.

[14:20] <ruoso> but where is @_ coming from?

[14:21] <pmichaud> ah, that's likely a bug, yes.

[14:21] <pmichaud> I'd have to check.

[14:21] <ruoso> PhatEddy has pointed me in pvt that this looks similar to 56366

[14:22] <ruoso> but I thought it would be different because it's not just failing to check empty signatures

[14:22] <ruoso> it's implying the default signature in empty signatures...

[14:22] <pmichaud> right -- in a couple of places we've added code to explicitly check for arguments passed to zero-arg subs.

[14:22] *** araujo joined
[14:22] <pmichaud> as far as default signature in empty signatures... I'll have to check.

[14:23] <ruoso> I mean... considering :(*@_, *%_) is the default signature

[14:23] <pmichaud> right now it appears that Rakudo treats any use of @_ as meaning "add a slurpy param"

[14:23] <ruoso> hmm... is that spec?

[14:24] <pmichaud> Yes.

[14:24] <pmichaud> S06:154

[14:25] <pmichaud> oh wait, that's for placeholders.

[14:27] <pmichaud> okay, we'll have to add some code for fixups.

[14:28] <pmichaud> that's likely to be a bit challenging

[14:28] <pmichaud> { @_ }     # uses outer @_

[14:28] <pmichaud> { $^a; @_ }    # has @_ as a parameter

[14:29] <pmichaud> { @_;  $^a }   # has @_ as a parameter.... but we can't determine that until we see the $^a placeholder.

[14:30] *** amoc joined
[14:30] <ruoso> { $^a; @_ } must use outer @_ as well

[14:30] <pmichaud> no, that's not what S06 says.

[14:37] <ruoso> these two were supposed to have different signatures...

[14:37] <ruoso> as per S06:154

[14:38] <skids> hrm should .arity return a range?

[14:38] <moritz_> no, .arity is only for required

[14:38] <moritz_> .count is for optional

[14:38] *** kimtaro joined
[14:40] <PhatEddy> So if 64344 stands as a bug it would seem to be distinguished from 56366 by its use of @_ which might be worth a comment and perhaps even a subject change for the former?

[14:43] <ruoso> well... the bug 64344 points is the generation of *@_ even without any other placeholder parameters...

[14:44] <ruoso> 56366 is about the innability to check empty signatures...

[14:51] <pmichaud> No, @_ isn't the cause.  It's a Parrot bug.

[14:52] <pmichaud> (for those functions that have been written in PIR)

[14:52] <pmichaud> actually, it's a Parrot bug in general.

[14:52] <PhatEddy>  the subject of 64344 is "empty signatures"

[14:53] <ruoso> PhatEddy, well... the bug is related to empty signatures ;)

[14:53] <ruoso> maybe that can be narrowed down a bit more
