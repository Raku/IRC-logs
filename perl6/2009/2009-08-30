[08:29] <rindolf> Stretchy.

[08:29] <carlin> the css validator doesn't like browser-specific border radii :(

[08:29] <rindolf> Fluid.

[08:29] <rindolf> Munctional!

[08:29] <rindolf> carlin: yes, it's kinda inane.

[08:29] <Su-Shee> carlin: yes. it's upcoming css3 which is supported by all major relatively recent browsers and will change to "border-radius" then. but it's not valid css2.x

[08:30] <Su-Shee> carlin: the next years will be somewhat fuzzy because all browsers are nowadays very much faster with implementing standards than the w3c actually releasing them.

[09:03] <Su-Shee> well if we're actually offering a central site for everyone to go to about everything perl 6 related, this is going to be very fast a rather large thing.. 

[09:03] <rindolf> Su-Shee: maybe code an off-line CMS.

[09:03] <rindolf> Su-Shee: or convert Latemp to p6.

[09:05] <Su-Shee> rindolf: I can manage with pure html and vi for a rather long time, so no hurry. but "a p6 cms" is something on the top 10 killer app list anyway.

[09:05] <rindolf> Su-Shee: ah.

[09:05] <Su-Shee> (blog engine, cms, wiki, forum, microblogging engine, web framework..)

[09:05] <rindolf> Su-Shee: how do you maintain a navigation menu across pages?

[09:08] <Su-Shee> rindolf: good question, next question. ;)

[09:08] <rindolf> Su-Shee: in Latemp, it's a no-brainer.

[09:09] <rindolf> Su-Shee: I never maintain a site as raw HTML.

[09:09] <rindolf> I always use Latemp or something.

[09:09] <rindolf> TT2 is also nice.

[10:35] <rindolf> There's also Chinglish and Engrish.

[10:35] <rindolf> They are really off.

[10:35] <Su-Shee> huf: here, the newspapers are constantly complaining about the imported english words.. ;)

[10:36] <huf> Su-Shee: oh yeah, that's also constant ;)

[10:36] <huf> funny how they never complain about all the latin and german and french and .... words

[10:36] <Su-Shee> huf: yeah. 200 years ago they complained about the massive invasion of french words :))

[10:36] <rindolf> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franglais

[10:37] <huf> Su-Shee: well, what can you do with people who think a language is a static structure...

[10:37] <Su-Shee> what's really nasty is the more I chat in english and read documentation in english, the more I start to mix german and english while actually speaking, because I don't know certain terms in german.

[10:37] <rindolf> Su-Shee: ah.

[10:37] <huf> Su-Shee: and that is the correct approach imho

[10:37] <rindolf> Su-Shee: it happens to me with Hebrew too.

[10:37] <huf> i *really* hate translating technical terms, which means that when we talk code, large parts of the sentence are in badly-pronounced english :)

[10:37] <rindolf> Su-Shee: I think most Israelis I know make many grammatical/etc. Hebrew mistakes.

[10:38] <rindolf> And some even Spelling.

[10:38] <Su-Shee> turkish girls here have perfected the language mix. for the sake of the communication flow, they use arabic, turkish and german in a rapid flow of speech.

[10:38] <rindolf> Though spelling modern Hebrew is difficult.

[10:38] <rindolf> And such mistakes were found in archaelogical excavations.

[10:38] <Su-Shee> huf: me too. and microelectronics for example I plainly don't know in german anymore.

[10:39] <rindolf> Su-Shee: doesn't most of the Turkish vocab come from Arabic?

[10:39] <Su-Shee> rindolf: no. totally different language family. but of course there's a large arabic corpus.

[10:39] <huf> my belief is that computers should be in english. your data could (but shouldnt, if at all possible) be in some weird provincial language you happend to grow up with, but the UI/code/docs/jargon should always be english.

[10:40] <Su-Shee> huf: I hear you.

[10:40] <rindolf> Su-Shee: yes, that's what I meant.

[10:40] <rindolf> Su-Shee: vocabulary.

[10:40] <rindolf> Su-Shee: not the grammar/syntax/etc.

[10:40] <rindolf> I hate localised error messages.

[10:40] <Su-Shee> OHYES!

[10:40] <Su-Shee> me too!

[10:40] <rindolf> They make reading many Google posts difficult.

[10:41] <rindolf> I mean stuff you find while STFWing.

[10:41] <huf> of course, we dont find it odd that a computer requires a special language to interact with :)

[10:41] <Su-Shee> rindolf: I'm the one who's called by non-techie friends in the evening and ask to give a dignose based on those messages. ;)

[10:42] <huf> but how to force this on the public?

[10:42] <rindolf> Su-Shee: heh.

[10:42] <M_o_C> Another disadvantage is that when googling for a solution you'll only get posts containing the localised error message...

[10:42] <Su-Shee> huf: luckily, many people adopt the english-based internet/tech slang.

[10:42] <huf> Su-Shee: i just claim very loudly that i dont understand hungarian error messages, whenever the subject comes up, so they know i wont/cant help :)

[10:43] <Su-Shee> M_o_C: and on top of all that a distribution-specific solution if it's linux.

[10:45] <carlin> http://xkcd.org/627/

[10:46] <huf> rindolf: is the spelling still hard in hebrew if you use the latin letters?

[10:46] <rindolf> huf: well...

[10:46] <huf> Su-Shee: i got my own computer at age 16. i'm heavily handicapped ;)

[10:46] <rindolf> huf: most people don't follow the right transliteration.

[10:46] <rindolf> Like they use k instead of "q".

[10:46] <rindolf> huf: and some letters in Hebrew don't have a good transliteration.

[10:46] <M_o_C> Meh, github http downloads are darn slow today...

[10:47] <huf> rindolf: oh?

[10:47] <carlin> github is always slow :(

[10:47] <rindolf> huf: for example it's Al-Quran - not Al-Kuran.

[10:47] <rindolf> huf: or Qur'an rather.

[10:47] <rindolf> huf: Al-Qadim too.

[10:47] <rindolf> huf: And it's not kwa.

[10:48] *** abra joined
[10:48] <rindolf> That was the original use of the word in the Phoenician alphabet.

[10:48] <rindolf> A "q" sound.

[10:48] <huf> hmm, sounds are so hard to talk about on irc...

[10:51] <rindolf> huf: yes.

[10:51] <rindolf> huf: think is - many Hebrew speakers say "k" instead of "q" in everyday speech.

[10:51] <huf> so you have dialects

[10:52] <rindolf> huf: but still, some Israeli arabs told me that learning to read and write Hebrew was much easier for them than learning Written Arabic.

[10:52] <Su-Shee> .oO(says the fellow with the nastily inflected language.. ;)

[10:52] <huf> Su-Shee: eh?

[10:52] <rindolf> huf: we have some dialects and variations.

[10:52] <Su-Shee> huf: aren't you hungarian? ;)

[10:52] <huf> yeah, but how do dialects enter into this :)

[10:53] <huf> we have a few but they're very minor

[10:53] <huf> nothing like german or english has

[10:53] <rindolf> huf: but Hebrew doesn't have a diglossia yet.

[10:54] <rindolf> huf: though sometimes I'm flabbergasted by the broken Hebrew that some people have.

[10:54] <huf> Su-Shee: mostly our dialects center around slight differences in vowel pronuniciation plus how they dealt with the loss of a vowel sound (the 'e' in men) 

[10:54] <huf> rindolf: s/hebrew/$local_language/ and yeah, i agree ;)

[10:55] <Su-Shee> huf: I liked hungarian. if you really just go with it, it's not even illogic.

[10:55] <rindolf> huf: I'm not talking about slang. I like a lot of slang.

[10:55] <rindolf> huf: but I'm talking about bad grammar.

[10:56] <huf> hmm... is that because hebrew is so recently resurrected?

[10:56] <huf> or is that just general ignorance 

[10:57] <Su-Shee> here, bad grammar is a question of "class" and education...

[10:57] <huf> same

[10:58] <huf> and it only comes out in complex sentences. everyone can perform simple ones correctly. 

[10:58] <Su-Shee> huf: here it's certain very specific constructions in simple sentences

[10:59] <Su-Shee> huf: which you either get right or not and that's determined by your environment.

[11:00] <huf> well, not really. no matter what stratum of society you grew up in, you're constantly exposed to the correct grammar. there's no excuse for not knowing that

[11:01] <Su-Shee> huf: you can avoid pretty well to be exposed to good newspapers or news and if you end up only with really bad reality shows on tv...

[11:01] <rindolf> I think that the misunderstanding of Latin by the vulgars has made the grammar of Romance languages.

[11:02] <huf> rindolf: i dont thin the people of rome spoke latin back in the day

[11:02] <huf> it was probably a vulgar dialect ;)

[11:03] <M_o_C> Su-Shee: Even newspapers contain more errors than one thinks they should...

[11:03] <Su-Shee> huf: sure they did - many of them badly of course. there's an entire corpus of people's latin.

[11:03] <Su-Shee> M_o_C: at least they get some nasty grammar fuckups right :)

[11:04] <huf> Su-Shee: wel yes, but even today latin and italian are mutually intelligible, so... latin can be said to be a literary form of italian :)

[11:04] <rindolf> huf: yes, they evolved from Vulgar Latin.

[11:05] <pmurias> ruoso: hi

[11:05] <Su-Shee> well yes and no. as latin was the main written language in entire europe up until.. leibniz I think, there's the line of written latin and the change of people actually speaking and evolving with latin.

[11:05] <huf> Su-Shee: but that latin is not the same as the latin romans spoke ;) not exactly, anyway

[11:06] * Su-Shee recommends the tv series "ROME" :)

[11:06] <Su-Shee> quote: "mother, it was just an orgy.." :)

[11:07] <huf> they live in esher?

[11:07] <rindolf> Su-Shee: I heard it was awful.

[11:07] <Su-Shee> rindolf: it was totally brilliant, I _loved_ it.

[11:07] <rindolf> Su-Shee: ah.

[11:09] <Su-Shee> rindolf: I really loved my ass off, they had the exact right amount of disrespect for "uuuh ahhh culture! old languages! latin!" ;)

[11:09] <Su-Shee> laughed of course. ;)

[11:14] <Su-Shee> rindolf: marcus antonius and cleopatra totally stoned... watch it. :)

[11:14] <rindolf> Su-Shee: Cleopatra was a bitch, BTW.

[11:14] <rindolf> She was one of the most Evil women in history , IMO.

[11:15] <Su-Shee> rindolf: well what do you expect from an imperial ruler and politician? ;)

[11:15] <rindolf> Su-Shee: I guess.

[11:15] <rindolf> Though some rulers were noble.

[11:16] <rindolf> Su-Shee: Cleopatra was also Macedonian in origin.

[11:17] <rindolf> She just married the the king Ptolmey of Egypt.

[11:17] <rindolf> Ptolmey (sp?)

[11:18] <rindolf> Ptolemy

[11:20] <rindolf> Modern Hebrew speakers can understand a large part of the Bible.

[11:20] <rindolf> Not all the words there.

[11:20] <rindolf> But most of them.

[11:21] <rindolf> Even though the grammar there is very different.

[11:21] <rindolf> for example you said "And he will go" for "he went"

[11:21] <rindolf> Or "and he went" for "he will go"

[11:21] <rindolf> And it's Verb ; Subject ; Object

[15:10] <rindolf> Su-Shee: coming right up.

[15:10] <rindolf> Su-Shee: not sure how fast it will be.

[15:10] <Juerd> While you're at it, make it web hybrid :)

[15:10] <rindolf> I think gtk+ tends to be kinda verbose.

[15:10] <rindolf> Su-Shee: have you tried Qt?

[15:11] <Su-Shee> rindolf: I don't have any qt apps so I don't use it.. right now I'm only at "trying to compile a more recent gtk version" ;)

[15:11] <Su-Shee> and while I'm at complaining: sometimes I really hate re-use as well... this is a list of dependencies plainly killing me...

[15:12] <rindolf> Su-Shee: slackware sucks.

[15:12] <rindolf> Su-Shee: in Mandriva installing gtk+ is a simple urpmi command away.

[15:12] <rindolf> Su-Shee: or upgrading it.

[15:13] <Su-Shee> rindolf: please don't annoy me now with assumptions about slackware. ;)

[15:13] <rindolf> Su-Shee: and on Mandriva/Debian/etc. I dislike polluting the main parition wiith installed files.

[15:13] <rindolf> Su-Shee: then why don't you use a package manager to install the deps?

[15:14] <Su-Shee> I don't pollute anything, I'm installing another gtk version into somewhere else for some experimental stuff. 

[15:14] <rindolf> Su-Shee: I see.

[15:14] <rindolf> Su-Shee: then why don't you build it against the glib/gobject/etc of /usr?

[15:14] <Su-Shee> rindolf: because I need them differently and elsewhere for a specific build enviroment... 

[15:14] <rindolf> Su-Shee: ah.

[15:14] <rindolf> Did you write scripts for that?

[15:15] <Su-Shee> not yet, it's the first build up to actually see what I really _have_ to package and script later.

[17:27] <rindolf> Unless she's Cleopatra.

[17:28] <rindolf> On the other hand Cleopatra was a queen.

[17:28] <moritz_> since "gentlemen" sounds one step nicer than "men", it's either "ladies" or "gentlewomen". "gentleladies" would be two steps, and thus unfair against the men

[17:29] <rindolf> Hmm... there's such a word as gentlewomen .

[17:29] <rindolf> How strange.

[17:29] <rindolf> Englishwomen

[19:34] <moritz_> colomon: that you can't add multis?

[19:34] <colomon> Yes.  Does a Null PMC.

[19:35] <moritz_> that should be easily fixed by moving it to the setting

[19:35] <moritz_> care to write a patch for that?

[19:35] <moritz_> ouch

[19:35] <moritz_> abs is a prefix ops right now

[19:35] <colomon> I don't know where to move it from?

[19:36] <colomon> I wondered about that!

[19:36] * moritz_ wonders if that's correct

[19:36] <colomon> TimToady said something about sin being an operator, and I extended it in my head....

[19:37] <colomon> I'm just now at the stage of messing around with the setting, I haven't peaked in any of the other Rakudo internals.

[19:38] <pmichaud> many of Rakudo's builtins need to be moved into the setting

[19:38] <pmichaud> abs is actually prefix:<abs>

[19:39] <colomon> Does that imply if you overload it, it also needs to be a prefix?

[19:39] <moritz_> where is that specced?

[19:39] <pmichaud> STD.pm:3762

[19:39] <moritz_> ok

[19:39] <pmichaud> token prefix:abs ( --> Named_unary) { <sym> » <?before \s*> }

[19:40] <pmichaud> I'm not sure how that should reconcile with 

[19:40] <pmichaud>  our Num multi method abs ( Num $x: ) is export   # S32-numeric

[19:40] <moritz_> by the prefix dispatching to the method?

[19:40] <pmichaud> sure, we could do that

[19:41] <pmichaud> but I don't think we can/should have both  prefix:abs   and method abs() is export

[19:41] <moritz_> it's what rakudo does now anyway

[19:41] <moritz_> src/parser/grammar-oper.pg

[19:41] <moritz_> 75:proto prefix:<abs> is precedence('o=') is subname('abs') { ... }

[19:41] <pmichaud> yes; rakudo was just following STD.pm here

[19:42] <moritz_> so should I preserve that while moving abs to the setting?

[19:42] <pmichaud> I don't know.  I'm not sure how to decide which operators are prefix and which are normal "is export"  (more)

[19:42] <pmichaud> for example, what about  exp() and log() ?

[19:43] <pmichaud> or sin() ?

[19:43] * moritz_ is in favour of having them all as ordinary subs

[19:43] <colomon> Seems to me that if any of them are, all of them are.

[19:43] <pmichaud> the problem with "ordinary subs" is that you lose the unariness

[19:43] <moritz_> I know

[19:43] <pmichaud> i.e.,    sin $foo + 3

[19:44] <pmichaud> so perhaps we really do need both, and the prefix just redispatch to the method/function form

[19:44] <pmichaud> I'd go for that

[19:44] <colomon> I don't see the benefit of having them be an operator, but I think TimToady had a reason...

[19:44] <moritz_> that reads ambiguously for me anway

[19:45] <pmichaud> if abs $x > 0 { ... }

[19:45] <colomon> Wonder if this is why I've been having trouble overloading sin....

[19:45] <pmichaud> in this case you want abs to be prefix:<abs> and not a listop

[19:46] <pmichaud> because as a listop it parses as   abs($x > 0)

[19:46] <pmichaud> colomon: you cannot overload any rakudo builtin that is written in PIR

[19:47] <moritz_> unless maybe with inline PIR

[19:47] <colomon> Ah, and sin still is?

[19:47] <pmichaud> at present we can only overload things that are in the setting, or have been specially written to be reblessed into Perl6MultiSub instead of parrot's MultiSub

[19:47] <colomon> There is a Num.sin in the setting, and in fact I think I may have managed to write Complex.sin...

[19:47] * pmichaud checks

[19:48] <moritz_> colomon: in general just go into rakudo/src and then type 'ack -w sin'

[19:48] <pmichaud> hmmm, I guess 'sin' isn't currently written in PIR

[19:48] <moritz_> (assuming you have ack installed. If not, it's high time to do so now :)

[19:48] <colomon> "ack: command not found"

[19:48] <pmichaud> it does look as though sin has been written in multiple locations.  that might be a problem.

[19:49] <colomon> where might I get ack?

[19:49] *** abra left
[19:49] <moritz_> from CPAN

[19:49] <pmichaud> cpan App::Ack  is what i use

[19:49] <pmichaud> afk for a bit

[19:49] <moritz_> debian has the 'ack-grep' package

[19:52] <colomon> MacPorts does not have it, alas.

[19:52] <colomon> But I will take a stab at just installing it from CPAN in a few minutes.

[19:55] <colomon> moritz_: Re: fixing these things myself -- what's the best way of handling the version control with that?

[19:56] <moritz_> colomon: you make your changes, test them, if everything is fine you commit them 'git commit -a'

[19:56] <colomon> Should I fork rakudo on github?

[19:56] <moritz_> then you make a patch from it: 'git format-patch HEAD^'

[19:57] <colomon> Ah!

[19:57] <colomon> I didn't know you could do that.

[19:57] <moritz_> then send that to [email@hidden.address] with [PATCH] included in the subject

[19:57] <moritz_> after that I usually reset my repo to the previous state

[20:49] <M_o_C> Question: Does infix imply that a function (or does that term only exist for operators?) only takes two arguments? (In a theoretic context, independent from how perl6 does it)

[20:49] <moritz_> M_o_C: no

[20:50] <M_o_C> s/(only) (exist)/\2 \1/

[20:50] <moritz_> M_o_C: if an infix is :assoc<list>, it can take an arbitrary number of arguments

[21:27] <moritz_> "1 is not equal 2" is true

[21:27] <colomon> surely want 1 != 2 ?

[21:27] <svarg> so we can use 1 ne 2?

[21:27] <svarg> and it works?

[21:38] <svarg> right?

[21:39] <moritz_> well, 1 and 2 are inequal both when compared as numbers and as strings

[21:40] <moritz_> whereas "0.0" and "0" are different when compared as strings, and equal when compared as numbers

[21:40] <svarg> as i remember, there is a difference between comparing strings vs ints.

[21:40] <svarg> ah

[21:41] <svarg> i believe it actually compares their ascii values, though not sure.

[21:41] <moritz_> not quite

[21:41] <moritz_> it compares graphemes, in theory

[21:42] <svarg> ah

[21:43] <svarg> i do remember something as strings/ints are compared differently, so it may be that "ne" is for ints and "!=" is for strings

[21:43] <svarg> no?

[21:43] <moritz_> no, the other way round.

[21:43] <svarg> or vice versa

[21:44] <moritz_> you can just try those things out:

[22:46] <pmichaud> colomon: I'm just making a few additional changes locally, but yes -- my intent was to simply get it started and then let others hack on it for a bit

[22:58] <colomon> pmichaud: A couple of quick questions, then before I take out the garbage and hit the pub.

[22:59] <colomon> Is it intended to be in simplified form?  So that 1/4 + 1/4 == 1/2 instead of 2/4s?

[23:00] <pmichaud> haven't gotten that far yet

[23:00] <pmichaud> I'm thinking it probably should, yes.

[23:00] <colomon> I'm thinking simplify in Rat.new?

[23:00] *** Whiteknight left
[23:01] <pmichaud> that'd be where I start, yes.

[23:05] <pmichaud> (sorry if I sound a little short -- other things happening in the background here)

[23:08] <colomon> No worries, I'm doing my own share of running around here.

[23:09] <colomon> If no one else has already done it, I'll look at taking a crack at it post-pub.

[23:09] <colomon> (Are there tests already?)

[23:09] *** synth joined
[23:09] <pmichaud> there are some Rat tests already, I think.  Pugs had the Rat datatype

[23:15] * wayland76 has an image of a pug with a rat in its mouth :)
