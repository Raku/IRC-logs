[01:30] <dduncan> something I'm wondering in general, has Rakudo caught up to Pugs in functionality and if not then what are the major differences ... or is this written somewhere ... maybe comparative smokes?

[01:30] <dduncan> or is it ahead in places?

[01:31] <dduncan> I'm guessing big number support is one difference based on GSOC entries

[01:32] <mberends> dduncan: mostly, details change too rapidly to document, Rakudo is ahead on regexen for example.

[01:33] <dduncan> or a separate question, is there any documentation for Rakudo specifically that says in broad strokes what features of the specced Perl 6 it implements and which it doesn't?

[01:33] <ascent_> bacek++ # very nice.

[01:33] <ascent_> ibm-- # for epKe-Alive header.

[01:33] <dduncan> I have seen changelogs that see what was added between releases

[01:34] <dduncan> but I didn't see a "where we are now" summary

[01:34] <dduncan> unless the test suite is that summary

[01:34] <mberends> dduncan: http://www.rakudo.org/status

[01:34] <dduncan> than youk

[01:35] <mberends> :)

[01:37] <mberends> it's amazing what can already be done by current Rakudo :)

[11:33] <sbp> so I'm wondering a) whether to continue trying to resolve that problem, which is pretty architecture specific, or b) trying to install perl6 via an alternative route. what would people here suggest?

[11:33] <sbp> (I should note that I pretty much just followed the directions on the best sites I could find to get a decent perl6 installation working)

[12:40] <mberends> finanalyst, your can either ~~ (smartmatch) individual rules/regexen within the grammar, or .parse the grammar, which then starts with regex/rule TOP. afaik, works here.

[12:45] <mberends> finanalyst, http://github.com/mattw/form/blob/master/t/04-parseactions.t for .parse() or http://github.com/eric256/perl6-examples/blob/master/lib/Pod/Parser.pm for smartmatch (using given/when).

[13:32] <finanalyst> what is the perl6 equivalent of the perl5 \&subroutine? I tried &name and just name

[13:36] *** justatheory left
[13:38] <skids> &subname should work, as long as there are no parens.

[13:39] <skids> But you may want to make a closure depending on how you are using it.

[15:38] <pmichaud> okay, that's better.

[15:40] <finanalyst> what is the <-[>]>* and why is .* not possible?

[15:41] <pmichaud> <-[>]>   matches zero or more characters that aren't '>'

[15:41] <pmichaud> (er,  <-[>]>* ...)

[15:41] <pmichaud> .* isn't possible because it doesn't backtrack

[15:41] <finanalyst> ok now i see.

[15:41] <pmichaud> it would be the same problem with

[15:41] <pmichaud>     '<'  [ tab .* ] '>'

[15:42] <pmichaud> we'd never match the final '>', because the .* would have already matched it.

[15:44] <finanalyst> regex has no backtracking?

[15:44] <pmichaud> regex does, but goal regexes have some odd semantics.

[15:45] <pmichaud> unless S05 has changed, the way it's defined it somewhat implies a "no backtrack" on the internal expression.

[15:46] <pmichaud> although I think I was supposed to change it.  Let me review the logs.

[15:48] <pmichaud> yes, I was supposed to change it.  I'll do that today.   (http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-01-14#i_832617)

[17:34] <literal> mberends: what's the status of your Perl 6 Pod::Parser?

[17:47] *** kate21de left
[17:50] <mberends> literal: most recently I built it in into a local webserver that can render any Pod file on your local drive. It handles common Pod 5 as well. http://planetsix.perl.org/ currently talks about it. Install http://github.com/eric256/perl6-examples/tree/master and give it a try :)

[17:52] <literal> mberends: I was wondering how useful it would be for this: http://groups.google.com/group/tpf-gsoc-students/browse_thread/thread/9bdc2409fa51e4e3

[17:54] <mberends> literal: great! this code would be quite usable for that, and the workout will stimulate more development.

[17:54] <literal> ok, great

[17:54] <literal> maybe you could reply to that post?

[17:56] <mberends> must create a Google account first, then yes, I'll reply.

[17:59] <szabgab> what is the nick of Hinrik ?

[18:00] <szabgab> hi

[18:00] *** Guest25865 is now known as bigpresh

[18:01] <literal> heh

[18:01] <szabgab> so I was wondering what should I write as a sample plugin in Perl 6

[19:07] <literal> nice

[19:07] <mberends> that's from Pod 5 source, whilst it's a Pod 6 parser :)

[19:08] <literal> yeah

[19:09] <literal> can you show me how it renders S26-documentation.pod ?

[19:09] * mberends searches...

[19:10] <szabgab> mberends, is that slow or just does not like me personally ?

[19:11] *** ejs joined
[19:11] <literal> the initial loading was slow here as well

[19:11] <mberends> it's not you ;) it is slow indeed. and that for a stream-based parser is worrying.

[19:15] <mberends> szabgab, literal: performance measurements http://gist.github.com/83138

[19:16] *** SamB joined
[19:16] <szabgab> timed out for me

[19:17] <mberends> :(

[19:20] <mberends> S26 is about 70K, so a time of 5-10 minutes is expected. Currently I'm looking to replace the stream-based with a tree-based parser in the hope that the regex engine's inner loops are faster than Rakudo's outer loops.

[19:21] *** orafu joined
[19:22] <mberends> ah. S26 finished here after some 5 minutes with the output truncated to the first 1k or so of xhtml.

[19:25] *** SamB left
[19:27] <literal> heh

[19:27] <mberends> 'make test' was taking about 50 seconds for 47 small documents in January, but lately has risen to about 150 seconds.

[19:28] <literal> is that due to changes in Rakudo/Parrot or Pod::Parser?

[19:30] <mikehh> how about make spectest without threading - it was about 15mins - now about 35 for me :-{

[19:30] <mberends> Probably the former, Pod::Parser didn't change significantly. There has been some discussion about performance in #perl6 and #parrot.

[19:30] <mikehh> ok there are a few more tests - but still

[19:32] *** SamB joined

[20:22] <sbp> okay, for anyone following my Rakudo Saga earlier, I managed to resolve it by getting Xcode 2.5 from http://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=19907 and then using the following installation method:

[20:23] <sbp> $ git clone git://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git

[20:23] <sbp> $ cd rakudo && perl Configure.pl --gen-parrot

[20:57] <[bjoern]> What is thy bidding?

[20:57] <sbp> well I just installed Rakudo

[20:57] <[bjoern]> cool

[20:57] <sbp> and I'm trying to write a p6grep, Ã  la pcregrep

[20:58] <sbp> it should be quite easy, but I have a problem

[20:58] *** eternaleye joined
[20:58] <sbp> where I'm doing if $line ~~ /pattern/, the regex works when it's /literal/

[20:58] <sbp> but if I try to use /<$pattern>/, it doesn't work

[20:59] <sbp> I'm wondering if variable interpolation into regexps isn't supported yet in rakudo

[20:59] <sbp> or if I'm doinitwrong

[20:59] <sbp> (the error I get is: Statement not terminated properly at line 9, near "~~ /<$patt")

[21:00] <[bjoern]> paste the code to http://sial.org/pbot/perl6 ?

[21:00] <mberends> sbp, the $pattern dos *not* interpolate by design.

[21:00] <sbp> mberends: I thought it was true that /$pattern/ does not interpolate

[21:00] <sbp> mberends: but that /<$pattern>/ *does*

[21:01] <pasteling> "sbp" at 86.8.186.21 pasted "p6grep.pl" (12 lines, 248B) at http://sial.org/pbot/35731

[21:01] <mberends> yes, afaik $pattern contains the name of another regex

[21:01] <sbp> oh, the name? hmm

[21:01] <sbp> I thought the content

[21:01] <[bjoern]> so how do you turn a string into a regex?

[21:02] *** donaldh joined
[21:02] <mberends> it seems to be discouraged by design, maybe to avoid tainting

[21:04] <literal> grammars and classes share the same namespace, right?

[21:05] <literal> their package names, that is

[21:05] <mberends> yes

[21:07] <mberends> sbp, I said it wrong, $pattern contains a regex object or literal characters

[21:08] <[bjoern]> so if it's a string it's as if all the special character are escaped?

[21:09] <mberends> but a * in $pattern always means '*', never repeat count.... yes
