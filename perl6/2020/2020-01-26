[06:09] <AlexDaniel> alright

[06:09] <AlexDaniel> I have no idea what I'm doing so bear with me

[06:14] <AlexDaniel> about ‚âà170 users here

[06:15] <AlexDaniel> about 30 leave every day, so I guess I can just wait a little and just let most of you naturally reconnect and get forwarded?

[06:16] <AlexDaniel> it's a better strategy than letting you idle on an empty channel anyway
