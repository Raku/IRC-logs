[10:13] <mojca> I would like to ask for some help building rakudo on macOS. Version 2019.07.1 built just fine. With 2019.11 I'm running into the following issue: https://paste.macports.org/e57b325c634d

[10:13] <mojca> Failed to flush filehandle: Operation not supported

[10:14] <mojca> The tests from nqp seem to all pass.

[15:32] <Doc_Holliwood> Why is the website still pointing to 2019.03 when we have .11 on the release page?
