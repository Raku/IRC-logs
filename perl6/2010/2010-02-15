[01:23] <shockwave> Is Rakudo implemented in Parrot's PIR language?

[01:23] *** jaldhar joined
[01:27] <colomon> shockwave: yes

[01:27] <colomon> Well, mostly there's an additional layer in there, called NQP (Not Quite Perl).

[01:29] <jnthn> shockwave: A chunk of it is written directly in PIR, however large parts are not - writing an entire compiler in an assembly language would be a frurstrating exercise. :-)

[01:30] <jnthn> Rakudo is a mixture of NQP (a subset of Perl 6, including an implementation of Perl 6 regexes, which we use for parsing), Perl 6 itself (we compile a first stage, and use it to compile a bunch of the built-in classes and functions) along with some PIR and C that implement primitives and act as "glue" between the rest and the VM.

[01:32] <colomon> jnthn: Just got "A method named 'min' already exists in class 'Range'. It may have been supplied by a role."

[01:32] <jnthn> Oh?

[01:32] <jnthn> Curious.

[01:32] <colomon> It's actually supplied by "has $.min".  I had thought I could use multi to get another min method as well.

[01:32] <colomon> ?

[01:32] <jnthn> No, 'fraid not.

[01:33] <jnthn> But you shouldn't have to.

[01:33] <colomon> Here's the test in question:

[01:33] <jnthn> If you write a method min() { ... } then the $.min should not bother generating a method automatically.

[01:33] <shockwave> Thanks for the answer, guys.

[09:55] <masak> the fact that STD parses that one doesn't mean it should produce anything sensible, though.

[09:58] <diakopter> no, 

[09:58] <masak> it's like 42[5].

[09:58] <masak> it parses, but it doesn't mean anything sensible in Standard Perl 6.

[09:59] <diakopter> it should parse only if Int were a subname, or it would fail.

[11:17] <masak> aren't 'say()' and 'print()' allowed?

[11:18] <masak> and what's the remarkable thing about 'can be detected at run time'? did you mean 'compile time'?

[11:38] <pausenclown> oh dear. i was toying around with the grammexes as in the calendar example and wondered how to handle delimited strings.

[11:40] <pausenclown> and had a look in the std.pm to see if i could cargo cult something from that

[11:40] <masak> 'delimited strings'? aren't all strings delimited?

[11:40] <pausenclown> *overload*

[11:40] * masak flaunts his ignorance

[11:41] <pausenclown> something like "foo" or bar or [%baz%], masak.

[11:41] <masak> that looks like three examples of very different entities.

[11:42] <pausenclown> somethings weird with my keyboard layout

[11:42] <pausenclown> i meant 'bar'

[11:42] <masak> ok.

[11:43] <masak> so you're basically talking about string literals.

[11:43] <moritz_> STD.pm might be a bit... too much with its approach

[11:43] <masak> yes, those are not entirely trivial to parse.

[11:43] <masak> consider just calling into Rakudo's own Perl 6 rule for parsing string literals.

[11:44] <masak> alpha: say "Can I call you like this?"

[11:44] <masak> moritz_: I see a need sometimes for doing evals on the old Rakudo branch.

[11:45] <masak> at least until ng-now-master reaches its full potential.

[11:45] <moritz_> but usually you can just do \' [ <-[']> | \\ \' ]*    \'

[11:45] <moritz_> similar to what you'd do in Perl 5

[11:50] <pausenclown> yeah but in a perl book i read online they had a syntax like token { "[" ~ "]" restoftoken }. when i try that rakudo croaks. not implemented or deprecated or sillymedumb?

[11:53] <moritz_> it worked last I looked

[11:55] <pausenclown> cool ty.

[11:56] <pausenclown> do you know about already made popular grammars? like Grammar::Html or Grammar::TT? Is there a namespace for this?

[11:57] <moritz_> I've written a JSON grammar in JSON::Tiny

[11:57] <moritz_> http://github.com/moritz/json/

[11:59] *** bluescreen joined
[11:59] <pausenclown> that was actually the example in the book i mentioned. when i copy and pasted it didnt work. ill try the repository

[12:01] <pausenclown> i just wonder if JSON::Tiny::Grammar shouldnt be Grammar::JSON

[12:02] <moritz_> there are also examples for XML, URIs and so on

[12:02] <moritz_> in other github repos

[12:03] <moritz_> http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/master/projects.list lists know modules; some of them have (or contain) grammars

[12:03] <moritz_> pausenclown: not Grammar::JSON - you also don't name things Class::Foo just because Foo is a class

[12:04] <moritz_> and grammars are (sadly) rather tightly tied to the class that uses them

[12:05] <pausenclown> why? you can tie entirely different action classes to a single grammar.

[12:05] <moritz_> yes, but the structure of the captures is very specific to a single grammar

[12:06] <moritz_> what I mean is that you can't easily replace the grammar with another grammar that parses the same text, but works differently

[12:06] <moritz_> for a given action class

[13:43] <pmichaud> (from backscroll) -- no, nqp doesn't use pge under the hood.  It used pge long enough to get it bootstrapped, but since then nqp is parsed using nqp.

[13:44] <scp1> So... does perl6 rule enough for me to actually try and get parrot running? :)

[13:45] <masak> scp1: Rakudo is in an interesting superposition of 'rule' and 'suck'. YMMV.

[13:46] <pmichaud> it 'rules' because Perl 6 is so awesome.  it 'sucks' because there are still some significant bugs/pieces missing

[13:47] <mathw> But they will come. This feels like a big milestone.

[13:47] <mathw> Even though it's a regression in terms of tests passing.

[13:47] <scp1> It seems very interesting. I guess this have been asked before, but in that state is perl6 right now? When should it be fully released, is there some schedule or something?

[13:47] <scp1> s/that/what/

[13:48] <moritz_> scp1: there's a shedule for a usable release: Q2 (likely April) this year

[13:48] <masak> scp1: I think the 'fully released' question is strange, if you don't mind me saying it.

[13:48] <scp1> oh really, awesome

[13:48] <moritz_> scp1: but no  schdeule for a language freeze or feature complete compiler yet

[13:48] <masak> scp1: what you should ask yourself is what needs you have, and how they interact with Rakudo-now and Rakudo-soon.

[13:48] <masak> myself, I have a need to try fun things with Perl 6. Rakudo is certainly ready for that. :)

[13:49] <moritz_> (if you're confused, Rakudo is a Perl 6 compiler)

[13:49] <scp1> My current needs is still learning perl5, but I think there's place for perl6 too :)

[13:49] <scp1> yeah, I know

[13:49] <masak> I have next to no need to see a 'full release' of Rakudo. I hardly know what that means.

[13:50] <scp1> Started late with perl, december last year, but since it's the most beutiful thing ever created I doubt perl6 will be any less sexier

[13:51] <mathw> If you think Perl 5 is the most beautiful thing ever created, Perl 6 is going to make your head explode with sheer joy.

[13:52] <scp1> :D

[13:52] <colomon> afk # skiing!

[13:53] <masak> scp1: want the tour? I can show you some things on the p6eval bot.

[13:53] <masak> rakudo: say "take the tour! " x 2

[13:53] <p6eval> rakudo 70667a: OUTPUT«take the tour! take the tour! ␤»

[13:53] <mathw> Personally, I'll consider Perl 6 'ready' when there's a compiler release which supports all the features I want every day and produces code which runs acceptably fast.

[13:53] <mathw> 'Finished' is an alien concept. There are just steps along the road.

[13:53] <scp1> masak, oh nice... that works in perl5 too though :)

[13:54] <mathw> scp1: he hasn't really started yet

[13:54] <masak> scp1: true. I'm just warming up :)

[13:54] <masak> mathw: I think that's a reasonable requirement. my point, to the extent I have one, is that 'finishing' will be a gradual thing any way, different for different people.

[13:58] <p6eval> rakudo 70667a: OUTPUT«AN INT␤A STRING␤»

[13:58] <masak> scp1: see what's happening there?

[13:59] <scp1> oh, types...

[13:59] <masak> yes :)

[13:59] <masak> actually, I should start by doing this:

[13:59] <masak> rakudo: sub foo(Str $a) {}; foo(42)

[13:59] <p6eval> rakudo 70667a: OUTPUT«Nominal type check failed for parameter '$a'; expected Str but got Int instead␤current instr.: 'foo' pc 177 (EVAL_1:75)␤»

[13:59] <scp1> wow, nice

[14:00] <masak> yes :)

[14:00] <scp1> uhm, I can not find any perl6 package in my distro...

[14:00] <scp1> community/parrot 2.0.0-1  standalone virtual machine that can be used to execute bytecode compiled dynamic languages

[14:00] <scp1> this babe?

[14:01] <scp1> and rakudo.

[14:01] <masak> that's the VM.

[14:01] <scp1> yeah, I need both?

[14:01] <masak> that and rakudo should suffice.

[14:01] <masak> yes.

[14:01] *** athenot joined
[14:01] <scp1> allright

[14:01] <masak> just the VM doesn't give you Perl 6.

[14:01] <scp1> heh allright

[14:01] <masak> compare JVM and Java.

[14:05] <mathw> Perl 6 doesn't have one single implementation like Perl 5 does. Perl 6 is a specification, and Rakudo is one of the compilers which implements it.

[14:06] <masak> that said, with all due respect to all implementors of the other implementations, Rakudo is the word that comes to mind when associating freely on "Perl 6" and "implementation" :)

[14:07] <mathw> Yes, it's definitely the furthest along

[14:07] <cognominal> there is a difference so. Java sucks while the JVM are ok. Here, Perl 6 is great while the implementations are immature.  :)

[14:07] <scp1> Talking types, isn't it legal anymore to use i.e my $str = 'string'; ?

[14:07] <mathw> And it's the one that runs on Parrot, which was always the initial plan

[14:07] <mathw> scp1: yes

[14:07] *** pmurias joined
[14:07] <mathw> you're free to not use types if you don't want to

[14:07] <scp1> ah allright

[14:07] <masak> 'gradual typing'.

[14:07] <mathw> underneath, the type system's still in action but your variables can be unconstrained

[14:08] <cognominal> this is not to say there are not great languages on top of the JVM

[14:08] <masak> there's an implicit 'Any' type added to such a container.

[14:08] <mathw> my Str $a; # can only assign Str and Str-derivatives to it

[14:08] <mathw> my $a; # can assign anything

[14:08] <scp1> yeah, okay, nice... reading about it

[14:08] <mathw> So you can choose how much static type checking you want

[14:08] <mathw> Personally I tend to go for as much as possible, but I'm a Haskell programmer

[14:09] <scp1> What?

[14:09] <scp1> Are there more languages then perl?

[14:09] <moritz_> lots; and you tend to need many more when you work on a real-world project

[14:09] <moritz_> like SQL for example

[14:10] <mathw> urgh

[14:10] <mathw> I'm not so fond of SQL

[14:11] <pmurias> moritz_: after i read Database in Depth from READTHEM i stoped liking SQL ;)

[14:12] <takadonet> hard to avoid not writing javascript...

[14:12] <masak> Su-Shee: :)

[14:12] <mathw> My manager is aware of my feelings about Java, and also aware that I'm a better C++ programmer, so he tends to let me just do C++ work :)

[14:12] <masak> takadonet: JS, fortunately, is not too difficult to like. the DOM API, on the other hand... :/

[14:12] <mathw> My previous manager made me do SCJP to try and get me to like it, but it didn't work...

[14:12] <moritz_> pmurias: I'm well aware that SQL is not THE solution, but often it's still handy, and better than writing a storage backend yourself

[14:12] <mathw> SQL could be a lot worse

[14:13] <pmurias> most things could be a lot worse

[14:25] <Su-Shee> we'll have to offer ourselves the perl 6 jobs for a year or two. 

[14:26] <mathw> I'd like a job working in Perl 6

[14:26] <masak> me too.

[14:27] <pmichaud> yes, a job in Perl 6 might be nice.  :)

[14:27] <Su-Shee> you'll have to introduce perl 6 in your actual job as successor. and you're the expert to migrate carefully into it.

[14:28] <scp1> heh

[14:28] <takadonet> planning to introduce Perl 6 to my workplace when Bioperl6 is done....

[14:28] <Su-Shee> no, I really mean it. noone is going to throw away all existing xy code and do it all over again in p6.

[14:29] <Su-Shee> takadonet: if you are already doing perl 6?

[14:29] <takadonet> Su-Shee: I was doing some but then work took over...

[14:29] <PerlJam> Perl 6 needs some "killer apps" (there will be more than one :)

[14:31] <pmurias> or use DBI:from<perl5> ;)

[15:13] <jnthn> pmichaud: Well...

[15:13] <masak> rakudo: class A { method Str { "OH HAI" } }; say ~A.new; say ~A

[15:13] <p6eval> rakudo 70667a: OUTPUT«OH HAI␤A()␤»

[15:14] <jnthn> pmichaud: I prefer the type I think.

[15:14] <jnthn> pmichaud: Actually, question.

[15:14] <masak> how come the user's Str method doesn't override stringification of the type object?

[15:14] <jnthn> masak: It shouldn't.

[15:14] <masak> jnthn: I know. how come it doesn't? :)

[15:14] <pmichaud> masak: for that, I think one has to have   method Str(self:U :) { ... }      or something like that

[15:14] <jnthn> pmichaud: Are we going to have a prophash on them anyway?

[15:15] *** PacoLinux joined
[15:15] <pmichaud> jnthn: well, we still have to have somewhere to hold the type information (more)

[15:15] <masak> pmichaud: ah, that explains it. thanks.

[15:15] <jnthn> masak: The current answer is "because the low-level role we mix in to make something a type object rather than just an ordinary instance overrides it"

[15:15] <jnthn> masak: The answer pmichaud gave is the right one. :-)

[15:16] <pmichaud> but that could conceivably become an attribute of container objects (i.e., attribute of Perl6Scalar)

[15:16] <jnthn> Well, I was wondering if we could eliminate the prophash for e.g. untyped, but I guess they all still need rw...

[15:16] <pmichaud> in short, we could start moving towards eliminating the use of the prophash

[15:16] <jnthn> I don't hate the prophash per se, I'm just aware it's one more gc-able.

[15:16] <pmichaud> I think we can eliminate the rw, also.

[15:17] <jnthn> What do we set rw on?

[15:17] *** lichtkind left
[15:17] <jnthn> Only ever an ObjectRef?

[15:17] <pmichaud> well, I was thinking that we know something is rw because it's a Perl6Scalar, but now I'm not so sure.

[15:17] <jnthn> If so, there's 7 PMC flag bits...

[15:18] <jnthn> We could take one for scalar, one for rw...

[15:18] <pmichaud> and by "it's a Perl6Scalar", I mean only the PMC itself, not anything it references

[15:18] <jnthn> Part of me thinks (that you won't like this idea but I'll say it anyway...) that we should factor out the "is it a scalar" and "is it rw" checks to dynops.

[15:18] <jnthn> Not for performance.

[15:18] <jnthn> But so we can more easily change/optimize the way we handle this in the future.

[15:18] <pmichaud> I was just thinking "isscalar" as a dynop, yes.

[15:19] <jnthn> Oh, I thought you'd hate the idea. :-)

[15:19] <pmichaud> well, the important thing about using Perl6Scalar as-a-type is that it's not a normal "isa" check.

[15:19] <jnthn> You can just compare ->vtable->base_type

[15:19] <pmichaud> i.e., right now if we do "isa ...", we end up checking the type-ness of the value as well as the containers

[15:19] <jnthn> == poitner comparsisson to see if it's a scalar

[15:20] <pmichaud> that's fine for "isa" checks, but I need something that just checks the container and not what it references.  so I was thinking dynop might be the way to do that easily.

[15:20] <pmichaud> your point about putting all of this behind abstraction opcodes makes a lot of sense also.

[15:21] *** cognominal joined
[15:23] <pmichaud> well, "is it a scalar" and "is it rw" have to be orthogonal, so they can't both be attached to the pmc type

[15:23] <jnthn> The other reason I like it behind such a thing, is that it'll be easier to hide however @other-vm do it behind the same thing.

[15:23] <pmichaud> so there has to be a flag somewhere

[15:23] <jnthn> Can they be attached to any PMC?

[15:23] <jnthn> Or just ObjectRef?

[15:24] <pmichaud> in general, only containers end up with properties

[15:24] <jnthn> hmm

[15:24] <jnthn> We can't really go using PMC flag bits on any old PMC.

[15:24] <pmichaud> at the moment that would be ObjectRef, Perl6Scalar, Seq, and Hash

[15:25] <pmichaud> no, we wouldn't be putting flags on foreign PMCs

[15:25] <pmichaud> only on our own container types

[15:25] <jnthn> Seq and Hash are high level objects, so it's what the Object PMC that matters.

[15:25] <jnthn> I wonder if it uses flag bits...

[15:25] <jnthn> We can always use the prophash of course.

[15:25] <pmichaud> and our container types are strictly containers -- they never hold values directly in the new model but always hold a reference to a value

[15:25] <jnthn> but saving a gc-able for many of our untyped containers would be nice.

[15:26] <pmichaud> so values never have properties on them

[15:26] <pmichaud> even if we don't use PMC flags, we can use standard PMC attributes

[15:27] <pmichaud> and that doesn't create another gcable

[15:28] *** nihiliad joined
[15:28] <jnthn> "attributes"?

[15:29] <jnthn> Oh, hmm, maybe.

[15:29] <pmichaud> yeah, the GETATTR stuff, not the object attributes

[15:29] <jnthn> Ah, I see.

[15:29] <jnthn> OK, well...I think we agree we want a dynop abstraction interface.

[15:30] <jnthn> If the first cut is done with properties because it's easy/familiar, that's OK.

[15:30] <pmichaud> well, I'd also like to find a good way to eliminate the setprops we do now.

[15:30] <pmichaud> but not necessarily with separate opcodes.  in some ways, I'd like to say "give me a Scalar" and have it already initialized with the standard scalar flags.

[15:31] <pmichaud> s/give me a Scalar/create a Scalar

[15:31] <jnthn> new_scalar 

[15:31] <jnthn> oh, not with seperate opcodes...

[16:23] <pmichaud> in fact, what we have mirrors S06 fairly closely

[16:23] <masak> I guess I don't need to submit a TODO for that one.

[16:23] <jnthn> That's...not the error I expected...

[16:23] <pmichaud> a container can suppress flattening by having a $ sigil.  That's orthogonal to the other items

[16:24] <masak> jnthn: it thinks &supersede is a sub.

[16:24] <pmichaud> a container can be readonly, in which case assignment is forbidden

[16:24] <pmichaud> oops, let me rephrase

[16:24] <pmichaud> a container can be a readonly reference to another container, in which case assignment is forbidden

[16:24] <pmichaud> a container can be a rw reference to another container, in which case assignment is delegated to the other container

[16:25] <pmichaud> a container can be rw in its own right, in which case it handles assignment itself

[16:25] <jnthn> masak: oh!

[16:26] <pmichaud> do we implement supercede yet?

[16:26] <masak> Seems not.

[16:26] <jnthn> pmichaud: Not really, but add_name knows what to do with it.

[16:26] <pmichaud> then just add a declarator for 'supercede' that says "not yet implemented"  :)

[16:26] <jnthn> I expected it to whine that supercede wasn't done yet a bit further on.

[16:26] <jnthn> add_name knows not to complain about re-decl though.

[16:28] <diakopter> masak: dunno. mostly it's a server-admin kind-of-thing

[16:28] <pmichaud> jnthn: anyway, so the things we have to manage are equivalent to  "is readonly", "is rw", and "is copy"

[16:28] <jnthn> pmichaud: Hmm.

[16:28] <jnthn> If ou look at it sidewaysish, I guess that works :-)

[16:29] <pmichaud> so what I'm guessing is that type-based isn't the way we want to go

[16:29] <jnthn> (We're not doing any copying)

[16:29] <pmichaud> "is copy" is basically the same thing as assignment

[16:29] <pmichaud> i.e., normal assignment

[16:29] <jnthn> Hm

[16:29] <masak> diakopter: yes. moritz_ gave me access, but I didn't add anything myself, mainly because I chickened out. don't want to break p6eval with no-one to help fix it.

[16:30] <diakopter> masak: it's not ultra fragile (it's easily fixable); go ahead and experiment

[16:30] <pmichaud> but the point is that $x ends up acting like a standalone variable, not bound to the argument in any way

[16:30] <pmichaud> in the same way that

[16:30] <pmichaud>     my $a = 4;   my $b = $a;    

[16:30] <pmichaud> $b is a copy of $a, not bound to the $a container at all

[16:30] <diakopter> masak: just do everything as the p6eval user in the chroot

[16:31] <masak> aye.

[16:31] <diakopter> see its crontab

[16:31] <masak> aye.

[16:31] <masak> diakopter: rakudo master (previously known as ng) uses a p/p1/p2 system. should the alpha branch also do something like that?

[16:31] <jnthn> pmichaud: I could see it that way too.

[16:32] <pmichaud> did we get rid of "is ref" ?

[16:32] <jnthn> Yeah

[16:32] <jnthn> well

[16:32] <jnthn> yes

[16:32] <pmichaud> what is it now?

[16:32] <jnthn> But we gained \

[16:32] <jnthn> "is parcel"

[16:32] <jnthn> But you write a \ before, not "is parcel"

[16:32] <jnthn> is rw implies is parcel

[16:32] <jnthn> is parcel on its own implies "don't apply any context"

[16:32] <diakopter> masak: actually the old master used p/p1/p2 system

[16:33] <diakopter> and so does the new master.  the old ng didn't use p/p1/p2

[16:33] <diakopter> I think

[16:33] <diakopter> hence the "missing ./perl6" msgs

[16:33] <masak> ok.

[16:33] <masak> oh, aha!

[16:33] <diakopter> so if you want to clone it, sure

[16:33] <diakopter> just... decrease the frequency of rebuilding alpha... it doesn't need to run every half hour

[16:33] <jnthn> pmichaud: Well, s/implies/means/ on the last one. :-)

[16:33] <masak> well, the need isn't as great, since alpha will be mostly static anyway. the crontab can... yes.

[16:34] <diakopter> also, disable the make test upon rebuild if you would, plz

[16:34] <diakopter> on both

[16:34] <masak> oki

[16:34] * masak is a little scared, but will try

[16:34] <pmichaud> okay, but the point of "is parcel" is that our symbol is bound directly to the argument, no reference, yes?

[16:34] *** payload joined
[16:34] <masak> nice change from breaking things, trying to make things work :)

[16:34] <jnthn> pmichaud: That's pretty much what happens.

[16:35] <pmichaud> okay

[16:35] <jnthn> pmichaud: In fact, I think it's very literally exactly what happens. :-)

[16:35] <pmichaud> whereas "is rw"  creates an objectref ?

[16:35] <jnthn> um

[16:35] <jnthn> Not sure without looking at the impl.

[16:35] <pmichaud> well, it pretty much has to be an objectref, yes?

[16:36] <jnthn> ah, waiting on a build, can check it...

[16:36] <pmichaud> sub foo(Int $a is rw) { ... }

[16:36] <jnthn> we're not doing tht at the moment.

[16:36] <jnthn>         if (sig_info->flags & SIG_ELEM_IS_RW) {

[16:36] <jnthn>             /* XXX TODO Check if rw flag is set. */

[16:36] <jnthn>             if (sig_info->variable_name)

[16:36] <jnthn>                 VTABLE_set_pmc_keyed_str(interp, lexpad, sig_info->variable_name, value);

[16:36] <jnthn>         }

[16:37] <jnthn> But yes, probably should.

[16:37] <pmichaud> well, $a has to have its own type information

[16:37] <jnthn> Right.

[16:37] <pmichaud> so it has to be an ObjectRef of some sort

[16:37] <jnthn> Well, er.

[16:37] <pmichaud> and assigning to $a performs the check but delegates to the referenced container

[16:38] <jnthn> my Int $x; sub foo(Numeric $y is rw) { $y = 1/2; } foo($x); # gotta fail

[16:38] <masak> diakopter: is the directory rakudo_old-master something I can use?

[16:38] *** payload left
[16:38] <pmichaud> right, no problem.

[16:38] *** payload joined
[16:38] <jnthn> I guess the delegation handls that for us.

[16:38] <pmichaud> $y has to be smart enough to enforce its type as well as the type of the thing it references

[16:38] <jnthn> ?

[16:38] <pmichaud> or delegation handles it

[16:39] <pmichaud> but yes, $y can check and if okay, pass the assignment to the thing it references

[16:39] <jnthn> What about multi fact(Int $n) { $n * fact($n - 1) } ?

[16:39] <jnthn> recursion?

[16:39] <jnthn> We don't want to wrap more and more of the same checks.

[16:39] <jnthn> I guess that argues smart rather than delegation. :-)

[16:39] <pmichaud> right, the checks can be smart

[16:40] <pmichaud> but in your example, there's also no assignment.  and $n is ro :-)

[16:40] <pmichaud> we only have to be smart in the case of 'is rw'

[16:40] <jnthn> Right.

[16:41] <jnthn> Bad example, I shoulda just said "recursion" :-)

[16:41] <pmichaud> right, I get the reference :)

[16:41] *** cjk101010 left
[16:42] <pmichaud> anyway, ObjectRef (or ObjectRef + Perl6Scalar)  needs to be able to handle the cases I mentioned

[16:42] <pmichaud> read-only reference

[16:42] <pmichaud> reference with delegation (is rw)

[16:42] <pmichaud> standalone container

[16:42] *** payload left
[16:42] <jnthn> *nod*

[16:43] <jnthn> I think we're arguing for a flag of some kind for sure, then.

[16:43] <pmichaud> and I wonder if, instead of having a separate property, if it's sufficient to simply check to see if what the ObjectRef references is itself another ObjectRef

[16:43] <jnthn> hm

[16:43] <jnthn> Could work too maybe.

[16:43] <jnthn> And cheap.

[16:44] <pmichaud> if so, we have to delegate the assignment, otherwise we do the assignment ourself

[16:44] <pmichaud> where "assignment" now means "reference a value object"

[16:44] <jnthn> I like the analog with signatures here though.

[16:44] <pmichaud> yes

[16:45] <pmichaud> oh, and ooh!  This cleans up array and list assignment a ton!

[16:45] <jnthn> Makes me feel a bit more comfortable that it's along the right lines.

[16:45] <pmichaud> it also fits a lot better with some of the things TimToady has been saying about binding/assignment

[16:45] <jnthn> *nod*

[16:46] <pmichaud> because instead of having to copy containers, I can just dereference them to get to the immutable values

[16:46] <pmichaud> big Win

[16:47] <jnthn> Yeah

[16:47] * jnthn hopes this one flies :-)

[16:47] <pmichaud> I think it will fly nicely.

[16:47] <pmichaud> need some nom, then I'll write it up

[16:47] <jnthn> OK

[16:47] <jnthn> I'm here for ~1.5 hours more

[16:47] <pmichaud> okay

[16:48] <jnthn> Then out for dinner and piva.

[16:48] <pmichaud> so, what we end up with is: 

[16:48] <pmichaud> (1) 'scalar' property suppresses flattening

[16:48] <pmichaud> (2) 'rw' property determines rw-ness

[16:49] <pmichaud> (3) ObjectRef to another ObjectRef delegates assignment (after possibly imposing more typechecks)

[16:49] <pmichaud> -end-

[16:49] <jnthn> 3 simple rules.

[16:49] <lisppaste3> pausenclown pasted "error" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/94991

[16:50] <pausenclown> WTF? http://paste.lisp.org/display/94991

[16:51] <masak> pausenclown: you'll at least need a semicolon before 'XML::Parser::Actions.new();'

[16:51] <pmichaud> maybe need a semi.... what masak++ said

[16:51] <pmichaud> but that still doesn't entirely explain it

[16:51] <masak> pausenclown: the rule in Perl 6 is that a semicolon OR a newline is always needed after a closing brace.

[16:51] <pmichaud> afk, nom

[16:52] <pausenclown> there is a newline

[16:52] <pausenclown> copz and paste error

[16:52] <masak> pausenclown: it works if I remove the 'grammar' line.

[17:01] <masak> maybe its presence shadows the error I get locally for some reason.

[17:04] <pausenclown> so any workaround suggestions?

[17:04] <masak> pausenclown: seems grammars are not implemented yet.

[17:04] <masak> pausenclown: workaround would be to use the January release :)

[22:37] <pmichaud> /^\s*(.*?)\s*$/   should work :-)

[22:37] <pmichaud>  /^\s*(.*?)\s*$/   should work :-)

[22:38] <colomon> pmichaud: Duh.  Don't know why I didn't think of that.

[22:38] <colomon> Actually, I was just reimplementing it in terms of the proposed trim_start and trim_end.

[22:38] <pmichaud> slightly more efficient might be   /^\s*:(.*?)\s*:$/

[22:38] <aesop> dear god

[22:38] <aesop> do i even want to read that

[22:38] <Tene> aesop: eh?  read what?

[22:39] <pmichaud>  / ^ \s*: (.*?) \s*: $ /

[22:39] <aesop> there thats easier

[22:39] <TimToady> just put :r on it

[22:39] <TimToady> .*? overrides ratchet

[22:39] <colomon> What is \s*:    ?

[22:39] <pmichaud> TimToady: yes, but there's still an assumed cut after the subcapture, I think

[22:39] <aesop> any number of spaces at the beginning followed by      ?

[22:40] <supernovus> use YAML::XS:from<perl5>;  # last time I tried blizkost, it certainly did not like XS modules.

[22:40] <pmichaud>  \s*:  is greedy whitespace, no backtracking

[22:40] <TimToady> use <( and )> instead?

[22:40] <pmichaud> rakudo/pge/nqp don't have <( and )> yet, although those might help :-)

[22:40] <colomon> pmichaud: oooooo.   but won't that screw up the second one?

[22:41] <pmichaud> colomon: shouldn't

[22:43] <colomon> Anyway, I've reimplemented trim in terms of the proposed trim_start and trim_end.

[22:43] <colomon> I hate those names, anyone have a suggestion of something better?

[22:43] <colomon> before I push...

[22:44] <pmurias> colomon: trim_front?

[22:44] <colomon> trim-beginning?

[22:45] <Tene> pre-trim and post-trim?

[22:45] <Tene> trim and mirt?

[22:45] <pmurias> trim-leading

[22:46] <pmurias> trim-trailing

[22:46] <Tene> trim-except-not-the-end and trim-except-not-the-start?

[22:46] <colomon> oooo, I like leading and trailing.

[22:48] <colomon> Is there a pref for dashes over underscores in the spec?

[22:49] <Tene> I strongly prefer dashes.

[22:49] <Tene> I hate typing underscores. :(

[22:51] <pmurias> colomon: an ack search seems to imply that

[22:52] <pmurias> Tene: that's not really a valid reason ;)

[22:52] <pmurias> s/reason/argument/

[22:53] <Tene> pmurias: invalid argument for what, exactly?  All I was supporting there was my preference.

[22:53] <Tene> and "I hate typing underscores" is certainly a valid reason to prefer typing dashes over underscores, given that I don't hate typing dashes.

[22:53] * PerlJam hates underscores too

[22:53] <PerlJam> dashes++  :)

[22:54] <Tene> I'm also comfortable trying to subvert the spec for my own benefit, fwiw.

[22:54] <TimToady> well, I'd probably just do btrim and etrim

[22:54] <pmurias> :(

[22:54] * supernovus crosses fingers, about to build the new 'master'... 

[22:55] <pmurias> TimToady: that was a joke?

[22:55] <TimToady> not at all

[22:55] <PerlJam> didn't some flavor of BASIC have left(), right(), and mid()  or were those just substr() variants?

[22:55] <Tene> is that abbreviated back-trim and entrance-trim?

[22:56] <PerlJam> for some reason the "trim" neuron twiddles that partial memory

[23:18] <pmichaud> looks like lots of spectest failures :-|

[23:18] <chromatic> I'll check them in after the Parrot release tomorrow.

[23:19] <pmichaud> I'm guessing the Makefile.in patch is the culprit

[23:19] <pmurias> chromatic: i looked at the modern perl book, one thought about the "how do we know that any random CPAN distribution is useable and usefull" is that not all CPAN distributions are usefull

[23:20] *** jferrero joined
[23:20] <chromatic> I can't see how the Makefile patch would hurt.

[23:20] <pmichaud> not the Makefile patch itself, but the fact that the branch merges pulled in the old makefile from master

[23:20] <chromatic> Oh.  Yes, that would suck.

[23:20] <pmichaud> so now ng is building using the wrong makefile.

[23:21] <pmichaud> crud.

[23:22] <chromatic> I don't see that in the diffs.

[23:38] <supernovus> Tene: I know, but as shown above, if you use augment class Int { ... above code here ... }; 2.times: { say "hello" }  it bails out claiming that the Integer class (not Int) has no method called "times".

[23:38] <Tene> ew ew I've always hated that stuff in ruby. ><

[23:39] <Tene> (yes, I know, not helpful)

[23:39] * lue wishes to know how to apply chromatic's patch (he is a HOPELESS beginner)

[23:40] <supernovus> I'm thinking something fairly major has changed in the way augmenting existing classes works. 

[23:40] <supernovus> rakudo: augment class Int { method times (&code) { for ^self { code() } } }; 2.Int.times: { say "hello" }

[23:44] <colomon> lue: you want the patch program.  err... you're on linux, right?

[23:44] <Tene> supernovus: please try it with custom classes not related to native types to verify whether the problem is with 'augment' or with the native type mapping.

[23:45] <supernovus> Tene: okay, will do.

[23:45] <lue> colomon, I am.

[23:45] *** dondalin joined
[23:45] <Tene> rakudo: class A { method foo { say "foo" } }; my A $a .= new(); augment class A { method bar { say "bar" } }; $a.bar();

[23:45] <Tene> see?  works fine.

[23:46] <Tene> rakudo: class A { method foo { say "foo" } }; my A $a .= new(); { augment class A { method bar { say "bar" } }; } $a.bar();

[23:46] <colomon> lue: grab the text from the patch, put it in a file named chromatic.patch (or something like that), then cd parrot and say

[23:46] <supernovus> yeah, I tried augmenting a custom class and it works fine.

[23:46] <Tene> So it's not properly lexically scoped yet, then.

[23:47] <TimToady> what's lexical scoped about augment?

[23:47] <TimToady> it modifies something that already exists

[23:47] <Tene> TimToady: Is augment not lexically scoped?

[23:47] <TimToady> nope

[23:48] <TimToady> it's for monkey patching

[23:48] <Tene> Is there a lexically-scoped version?

[23:48] <TimToady> my class Foo is OUTER::Foo {...}

[23:48] <Tene> Okay.  Thanks.
