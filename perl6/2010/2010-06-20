[07:21] <sawyer_> so, i started learning perl6 over the weekend

[07:22] <sawyer_> i have a few comments, and i'll be doing that in a blog post today

[07:22] <sawyer_> one thing i have to ask about... camelia?

[07:25] *** Sarten-X joined
[07:33] <sorear> a blog post is a great way to get ignored by me.  I don't follow random people waiting for them to ask questions

[07:33] <sorear> if you want to get a reply, you should actually send your comments to a forum that the Perl 6 community reads

[07:34] <sorear> as opposed to a blog, which I guess is a forum that people in your old community(s) read?

[07:34] *** Sarten-X left
[07:34] <sawyer_> sorear, well, i wouldn't be writing this blog post to specifically get ignored by you. it's nothing personal :)

[07:34] <sawyer_> and i wouldn't be writing it to ask questions, since it's not the appropriate forum for that

[07:34] <sawyer_> it wouldn't include any questions, actually

[07:35] <sawyer_> the one thing i wanted to ask about, i asked. there was a question mark after the word "camelia" :)

[07:35] <sorear> Unless you're secretly really famous, I doubt many of the people who already read your blog are Perl 6 experts

[07:35] <sorear> is my only point

[07:35] <sawyer_> why would it matter?

[07:35] <sawyer_> i'm not asking them anything through the blog

[07:35] <sawyer_> i asked here

[07:36] <sorear> ah.

[07:36] <sawyer_> i just said i'll be writing a blog post on perl6, in case anyone cares

[07:36] <sorear> well carry on then

[07:36] <sawyer_> is all :)

[07:36] <sorear> I'm pretty new here, I don't know much about camelia either

[07:37] <sawyer_> doesn't it seem... 7-year-old-esque?

[07:37] <sorear> perl 6 is 9, not 7

[08:10] <TiMBuS> the idea is nice, but it probably needs a shiny web2.0 version before perl6 is considered Serious

[08:10] <sawyer_> i just don't like the way it looks, the strong saturated colors (which were the same for the boxes on the website - but were changed since) and all

[08:10] <sawyer_> happy to hear it'll get a bit of a (natural) facelift :)

[09:50] <moritz_> it seems that Math::Model + Math::RungeKutta + rakudo is too slow to brute-force calculate resonance curves

[10:14] <TiMBuS> ok so, the only solution ive managed to think of for getting utf8 strings from a socket is to call $str.encode.decode

[10:14] <TiMBuS> and i know this is not doing what i want it to do, is it

[10:14] <sorear> rakudo doesn't really support unicode at the moment

[10:14] <sorear> masak is halfway through a GSoC to fix that

[10:14] <TiMBuS> it does if its coming from a utf8 terminal though

[10:15] <phenny> sorear: I'll pass that on when masak is around.

[10:15] *** Sarten-X left
[10:15] <sorear> your IRC bot needs to handle any sequence of bytes

[10:16] <sorear> not just characters

[10:16] <TiMBuS> works when i do this encode/decode thing though

[10:16] <sorear> like it or not, IRC encodings are not standardized

[10:16] <sorear> I frequently get 8859-1, UTF-8, and KOI8-R on this network

[10:19] <TiMBuS> i pretend everything is utf8. that is my terrible solution. i just need rakudo to do that as well instead of freaking out when its expecting ascii (or whatever it is expecting)

[10:19] <arnsholt> Rakudo should be able to do UTF-8 I think

[10:21] <TiMBuS> im not even sure anymore D:

[10:21] <moritz_> .WHAT tells you

[10:21] <moritz_> if it's a Str, but an √§ is two characters in that string, it's a bug in rakudo

[10:23] <TiMBuS> its a Str, you want me to throw some characters at it and get the result of .chars

[10:34] <tadzik> moritz_: in rakudo?

[10:34] <sorear> I think pugs' response is the most natural one; merely assigning a sub in BEGIN shouldn't be enough to make it cloned

[10:35] <TimToady> between audreyt++ and Haskell the semantics of pugs are usually pretty clean

[10:35] <moritz_> tadzik: the file is in the pugs repo, but if you run 'make testable' in rakudo it downloads it for you

[10:35] <sorear> Because, IMO, the pad cloner shouldn't care about what's stored in the protolexpad

[10:35] <sorear> it should just copy the values

[13:45] <moritz_> just in case :-)

[13:47] <masak> the fact that all those parabolas look the same modulo scaling (in the absence of air resistance) feels like a nice generalisation of the observation "first it goes up, and then it comes down again" :P

[13:56] <moritz_> hey, give that back!</purl>

[13:56] <masak> I usually have an intuition for such things, but here it fails me, it seems.

[13:57] <moritz_> scaling is a linear operation

[13:57] <moritz_> if you scale any factor in a linear differential equation, the solution is also just scaled

[13:57] <moritz_> wouldn't work if you had $:velocity**2 dependency, as is the case with air drag

[14:27] * hugme hugs moritz_; tweet delivered

[14:29] <tadzik> is 'use v6;' recommended only to not accidentally run the code with Perl5?

[14:30] <masak> tadzik: you have my personal recommendation.

[14:30] <masak> tadzik: sometimes I accidentally write 'perl' instead of 'perl6', and then it's a life-line.

[14:30] <moritz_> tadzik: when Perl 6 supports Perl 5 interop, you actually have to 'use v6;' because v5 will be the default

[14:30] <tadzik> yeah, I've run onto it a few times

[14:30] <masak> it's also good documentation. :)

[14:30] <moritz_> and what masak++ said

[14:31] <tadzik> I see

[14:31] <moritz_> the error messages from perl 5 can be rather surprising if you use it accidentally, and don't have that v6 safeguard

[14:31] <tadzik> and one more, in general the scripts should be named .pl or .p6?

[14:32] * moritz_ prefers .pl

[14:32] <moritz_> but it doesn't really matter

[14:33] <masak> amazing how many simply parrot stale misunderstandings about Perl.

[14:34] <masak> tadzik: I prefer not to give my scripts an extension at all. on Unix, executables generally don't have an extension.

[14:34] <masak> tadzik: if I had to choose one, I'd go with .pl

[14:35] <tadzik> Well, I like the extensions for vim to choose the syntax hilighting correctly

[14:35] <moritz_> # vim: ft=perl6

[14:35] <masak> indeed.

[14:35] <tadzik> yeah, I know. But it's easier to just name it .p6 imho

[14:36] <tadzik> I don't use prolog

[15:02] <masak> sometimes I deplore the fact that I can no longer use &die to print things like usage messages in Perl 6. (because I don't want the backtrace.) instead, I use &note and then &exit.

[15:02] <masak> I know the `die "usage message\n"` was an unforgivable exception -- and one that probably doesn't belong in Perl 6 in that form -- but it did have its uses.

[15:03] <colomon> masak: can I use current proto with an installed rakudo?  I had trouble last time I tried that....

[15:04] <masak> colomon: I do believe it's possible, but you have to tweak proto's config file after it's been automatically generated.

[15:04] <tadzik> can one use proto without compiled parrot and rakudo sources lying around?

[15:04] <colomon> so how do I generate the config file?

[15:05] <colomon> tadzik: proto is designed to install rakudo / parrot for you.

[15:05] <masak> colomon: it's generated the first time ./proto is invoked.

[15:05] <tadzik> colomon: yes, but can it be used with rakudo/parrot installed separately?

[15:05] <colomon> masak: errr... git doesn't seem to have a proto/proto

[15:06] <colomon> perl6 proto.pl, maybe?

[15:06] <colomon> or perl proto.pl configure proto

[15:06] <colomon> ?

[15:07] <masak> colomon: what? nonono.

[15:07] <masak> you just run it. with perl, not perl6.

[15:07] <colomon> with "configure proto" tagged on?

[15:07] <masak> it has a shebang line, so you shouldn't even need the 'perl'. just ./proto

[15:08] <masak> colomon: I shouldn't be giving instructions, actually. proto has changed too much since I knew how to operate it.

[15:08] <masak> it's fully possible you need to write 'configure proto' nowadays. :(

[15:08] *** Sarten-X left
[15:09] <colomon> gack, still less than completely user friendly.

[15:10] <masak> :(

[15:10] * masak resolves to get pls up-and-running as soon as possible

[15:10] <colomon> masak++_

[15:10] <masak> as far as I'm concerned, proto is no longer maintained.

[15:10] <masak> everyone has access rights to it, so if there's something you can do to make it work less badly right now, feel free.

[15:10] <colomon> first, README combines the configure proto and install rakudo stages.  (minor)

[15:10] <masak> but a better solution is on the assembly line.

[15:11] <masak> colomon: again, patches welcome.

[15:11] <colomon> then when you run the configure, it tells you it's created 'proto.conf', but not where it has created it.

[15:12] <colomon> masak: if I get the tuits, I'll try to do some patches at YAPC::NA.

[15:12] <masak> colomon: cool -- thanks.

[15:13] <colomon> (right now, actively working on rakudo and trying to watch a 21-month-old, probably not a good time to also be patching unfamiliar code!)

[19:02] <slavik> basically, it should be something that wouldn't change behavior from day to day like it is likely to do now

[19:53] <Tene> Lemme look.

[19:54] <moritz_> Routes.pm line 21 and onwards is a bit confusing with inner and outer %_

[19:55] <Tene> oh, that's kind of unfortunate.

[19:56] <moritz_> and rakudo has problems with placeholders inside methods

[19:56] <moritz_> rakudo: class A { method m { my $c = { $:foo } } }; say A.new.m.(:foo).perl

[19:57] <moritz_> huh

[19:57] <moritz_> I don't understand that error at all

[19:57] <avar> what does larry's "soon can bootstrap past gimme5" in the notes mean? Is STD going to be used for rakudo et al?

[19:57] <Tene> anyway, you can *certainly* rename *%_ to something less bad.

[19:58] <Tene> Lemme just check my understanding of it against alpha

[19:58] <moritz_> avar: it means that gimme5 has been replaced by something that uses itself for parsing

[19:59] <moritz_> s/itself/STD.pm/

[20:01] *** Sarten-X left

[20:01] <Tene> That's... unfortunate.

[20:02] <moritz_> Tene: does Routes.pm compile at all?

[20:02] <Tene> Yes.

[20:02] <Tene> and the first three tests pass.

[20:03] <moritz_> ouch

[20:03] <moritz_> the error message comes from the method earlier

[20:07] <sorear> avar: ah, found them.  chromatic was delayed for a while preparing the notes and those are about a month behind the current

[20:07] <sorear> gimme5 is dead and gone

[20:08] <sorear> this means that STD.pm6 is now being parsed using STD.pm6, instead of 1000 lines of Perl 5 s/// statements

[20:09] <Tene> so I should be able to make a simple test...

[20:10] <Tene> did this ever work?

[20:10] <moritz_> no idea

[20:10] <Tene> it references %:controllers, but it doesn't even set controllers in the call

[20:10] <Tene> look at lib/Routes/Route.pm +60

[20:10] <Tene> commented out.

[20:10] <moritz_> it's comme... right

[20:11] <Tene> so... the thing that's being called couldn't have ever worked anyway.

[20:11] <moritz_> and %*controllers is never set anywhere

[20:12] <Tene> do named args fall back like that?

[20:12] <Tene> I didn't know that.

[20:12] *** Sarten-X joined
[20:12] <moritz_> what do you mean?

[20:12] <moritz_> last touched: a52df009 (Ilya Belikin 2009-06-05 23:52:52 +1100 60)

[20:13] <Tene> Routes.pm +25 looks for something in %:controllers

[20:13] <Tene> oh, I get what you're saying now.

[20:13] <Tene> Sorry, reading comprehension slow today. :)

[20:13] <moritz_> that's a named placeholder

[20:14] <Tene> I misunderstood why you were talking about %*controllers

[20:14] <Tene> earlier in Routes::Route.apply it assigns from $!stuff, and I didn't notice that the commented out line used $* instead

[20:15] <Tene> So I was confused when you mentioned that %*controllers was never set

[20:16] <moritz_> it seems that method connect would set up $!code appropriately to expect an 'action' named argument

[20:16] <moritz_> but it's never called?

[20:16] <Tene> Yeah, Routes was Ilya's project, but I never looked at it.

[20:16] <Tene> and nothing in the web repo outside of t/routes/ uses it

[20:17] <Tene> So... probably safe to ignore Routes, I bet.  Looks like Ilya fell out before getting it usable.

[20:17] <Tene> afaict

[20:17] <Tene> masak would know better.

[20:17] <moritz_> it's now in the same failing state as on alpha

[20:33] <jnthn> Yes, you will get different errors between multi and non-multi dispatch.

[20:34] <jnthn> Ah

[20:34] <jnthn> That's...more interesting.

[20:34] <FardadJalili> jnthn: you see ? :d

[20:35] <FardadJalili> jnthn: with multi, it's quick sort, without multi, it just complains.

[20:35] <jnthn> Yes, that's a surprising inconsistency.

[20:36] <patrickas> problem is with if i think

[20:37] <jnthn> A say $p.WHAT; at the start is revealing.

[20:37] <patrickas> my @my-array = 4,2,3,4;sub fsort([$p?,*@r]) {	if $p || @r {return fsort(@r.grep( {$_ <= $p} )),$p,fsort(@r.grep( {$_ > $p} )) ;	}} ;say fsort(@my-array).join(' ');

[20:38] <jnthn> I can't help but wonder if it's a closures bug.

[20:38] <jnthn> But that seems a long shot.

[20:39] <FardadJalili> but what does closure or if have to do with multi?

[20:39] <jnthn> I don't get why if would have anything to do with it.

[20:40] <jnthn> The closures issue is feasible. (more)

[20:41] <jnthn> When we produce a non-multi, the thing that we install into the namespace is a wrapper around a Parrot sub. For multis, the thing is a bit less wrapped. The closures bug we have at the moment is due to those wrappers.

[20:41] *** Sarten-X left
[20:41] <jnthn> It could just be.

[20:41] <jnthn> Anyway, we should file an RT on this one.

[20:42] <jnthn> I'll re-visit it when the closures stuff is fixed up since that's going to happen anyway in the near future.

[20:42] <jnthn> And if it's still there after that, I'll go digging into the dispatch code.

[20:42] <jnthn> But it'd be an extremely odd bug - especially given you're using a sub-signature, which has to be processed the same way in both single and multi dispatch.

[20:42] <jnthn> (In terms of how we bind.)

[20:43] <patrickas> but this still does not explain why putting the if first fixes it!

[20:45] <diakopter> re: complete vs production-ready, I think it would be helpful to at least document the different opinions on those definitions/distinctions: also  "usable"  and  "useful"

[20:45] <jnthn> patrickas: I don't know -- the if first implies an extra block.

[20:45] <jnthn> patrickas: Could be enough.

[20:45] <jnthn> There's certainly *something* wrong here, anyway.

[20:46] <jnthn> Did anyone submit some Rakudo bug yet?

[20:46] <sorear> Is it legal to add methods to a class after first instantiation?  I know it's not so for attributes

[20:46] * moritz_ not

[20:46] <jnthn> sorear: Rakudo lets you do what with methods, yes.

[20:46] <sorear> Rakudo lets you do a lot of things I don't want to have to support

[20:46] <jnthn> sorear: I don't think anything in the Perl 6 spec currently says attributes can't be added to a class after instantiation either.

[20:47] <jnthn> sorear: It's just a bit nasty to get Rakudo to do that, and low demand, so it's way down the todo list. :-)

[20:48] <jnthn> I think by spec both are kosher though.

[20:48] <jnthn> The question is whether existing instances are affected or not.

[20:48] <jnthn> Or if it just installs a new "version" of the class. But that has other issues too.

[20:50] <jnthn> o/ mberends 

[20:50] <jnthn> You made it. :-)

[20:52] <FardadJalili> jnthn: did you just increment me? :)

[20:52] <mberends> jnthn: only just in time, they expected classes from just after 6pm to just after 10pm. These Swedes are so motivated!

[20:53] <jnthn> mberends: Whoa!

[20:54] <jnthn> They're really putting you to work here.

[20:54] <mberends> well, they're so nice about it, it's hard to refuse ;)

[21:02] <moritz_> my physical modelling blog post attracked about 2k visitors so far

[21:03] <FardadJalili> moritz_: I'm just reading it. amazed that you are a physicist. :)

[21:04] *** mmcleric joined
[21:04] <moritz_> well, gotta do something for a living :-)

[21:05] <sorear> physics and programming are pretty synergistic these days

[21:05] <sorear> building partical accellerators: very expensive

[21:05] <moritz_> it's hard to do physics without any programming

[21:05] <moritz_> or at least programming is a natural approach to many physics problems

[21:05] <sorear> also, TimToady is a linguist by education

[21:06] <sorear> Math::Model reminds me of some stuff I did a couple years ago

[21:06] <FardadJalili> Richard Stallman was a pysicist too, when I think about it :-?

[21:06] <sorear> I had a perl script which accepted a subset of SPICE notation, munged it into C code for runge-kutta, and fed it to gcc

[21:07] <sorear> it was cute seeing a perl script run 1,000 times faster than SPICE :)

[21:09] <moritz_> nice :-)

[21:09] <moritz_> well, Math::Model is quite slow right now

[22:32] <cygx> I was bored, so I wrote something for moritz_' challenge: http://nopaste.snit.ch/21424

[22:33] <cygx> don't hurt me because the dummy-baclend is in PHP ;)

[22:38] <Tene> okay, one big error in httpd::daemon is:

[22:38] <Tene> rakudo: my $f = "O HAI"; say "<p>$f</p>";

[22:38] <p6eval> rakudo e298e5: OUTPUT¬´Method 'postcircumfix:<{ }>' not found for invocant of class 'Str'‚ê§  in main program body at line 1‚ê§¬ª

[22:39] <Tene> it's interpreting that as $f{'/p'}

[22:39] <ajs> That's correct, I think

[22:39] <Tene> should it?  I'm unsure of the interpolation rules.  Seems possibly confusing to me, though.

[22:39] <ajs> Oh certainly, HTML and XML in double quotes are going to be a major source of problems

[22:40] <ajs> We might demand that the interpolation parser get really strict about that, and only accept 

[22:40] <ajs> '$' <ident> '<' ~ '>' <something>

[22:41] <ajs> where <something> is probably just <ident>

[22:41] <ajs> and treat everything else after the first ident as literal

[22:41] * FardadJalili says goodbye

[22:42] <ajs> But that still leaves "$blurb<p>four score and seven</p>" as a problem

[22:42] <ajs> so it's not a solutioon

[22:42] *** FardadJalili left
[22:43] *** Sarten-X joined
[22:43] <jnthn> Tene: Correct, afaik.

[22:43] <jnthn> Tene: Though that one bit me too.

[22:44] <ajs> The nice thing is that you can lexically scope overrides to the parser, so you could do something like write an XML::SafeQuote that issues warnings when it sees somthing that looks like XML in a double-quoted string getting interpreted as Perl 6 syntax.

[22:45] * jnthn is tired and takes an early night o/

[22:45] <ajs> Rest well

[22:47] <ajs> "use strict" is going to flower into many, many different kinds of interesting syntax pragmas in Perl 6, methinks.

[22:48] <ajs> Heh, I could even imagine a "use Style::Gnu" or "use Style::MyCompany"... that would be kind of cool.
