[01:04] <colomon> spec's a little broken, too.

[01:04] <jnthn> colomon: spec or spectest? :-)

[01:05] <colomon> (looking at div, %, and mod)

[01:05] <colomon> spec

[01:05] <jnthn> Patch away! ;-)

[01:05] <jnthn> > my (Int $x, Num $y); say $x; say $y;

[01:05] <jnthn> Any()

[01:05] <jnthn> tssk...fejl.

[01:05] <colomon> only trouble is knowing what the right thing to do is.  :)

[01:06] <colomon> jnthn: here's the deal, if you don't mind me talking it through with you.

[01:06] <jnthn> Sure, I'm oddly awake given it's 3am, so I'll maybe even follow. :-)

[01:07] <colomon> % is defined as $x % $y == $x - floor($x / $y) * $y

[01:07] <colomon> that's for all Real types.

[01:07] <colomon> and that makes sense, IMO.

[01:08] <colomon> mod is defined as $x mod $y == $x - ($x div $y) * $y

[01:08] <colomon> mod is supposed to fail if the types of $x and $y are different.

[01:09] <colomon> div is generic division, also supposed to fail if the types are different.

[01:09] <jnthn> OK.

[01:09] <jnthn> "types are different" ==> the types have to be the exact same thing? 

[01:10] *** whiteknight left
[01:10] <colomon> "Not coercive, so fails on differing types."

[01:10] <jnthn> e.g. an Int and an Int is fine, a Rat and a Rat is fine, but a Real and a Real is not?

[01:10] <jnthn> er

[01:10] <colomon> jnthn: that would be my understanding.

[01:10] <jnthn> Two things that satisfy Real I mean

[01:10] <jnthn> OK

[01:10] <eternaleye> What if the second arg is a subclass of the first arg's class?

[01:11] <eternaleye> ::T, T would match, but potentially be incorrect for that case

[01:11] <colomon> (though that seems a little daft... I mean, it could always just dispatch to / or % if the types differ)

[01:11] <jnthn> eternaleye: Yes, that's not quite tight enough.

[01:11] <jnthn> You'd want something like

[01:11] <colomon> anyway, here's the weird bit.

[01:11] <jnthn> :(::T1 $a, ::T2 $b where { T1 === T2 })

[01:12] <colomon> for integer types, $x div $y == floor($x/$y);

[01:13] <jnthn> Aye, so for integer types div works out just as % would, essentially?

[01:13] <colomon> so for integer types, the definitions for mod and % are the same, just mod guarantees the resulting type is the same as the input type.

[01:13] <jnthn> er, mod, yes.

[01:13] <colomon> yes.

[01:13] <eternaleye> jnthn: Would omitting :: on the second T and using .WHAT in the where potentially be more efficient, due to only running the where in the case where it's a subclass or equal?

[01:13] *** c9s joined
[01:13] <jnthn> eternaleye: No, it'd be less efficient under the current implementation.

[01:13] <eternaleye> Huh

[01:14] <colomon> what strikes me as weird is that, as I understand it, for non-integer types, div is the same as /

[01:14] <jnthn> eternaleye: Oh, sorry, I mis-read

[01:14] * jnthn reads again

[01:14] <eternaleye> :(::T $a, T $b where { $b.WHAT === T })

[01:14] <jnthn> Ah, OK

[01:15] <colomon> but in that case, for non-integer types, mod always returns 0.

[01:15] <jnthn> But there you're specifying *two* constraints on $b

[01:15] <jnthn> That it has to be T, and that it has to match the thingy afterwards.

[01:15] <jnthn> In the long run, the second would be more optimizable.

[01:16] <jnthn> At the moment, you end up running two checks rather than just one.

[01:16] <eternaleye> Hm, true. It all comes down to the probability of the where clause being run

[01:16] <jnthn> colomon: Hmm.

[01:17] <jnthn> colomon: But div also enforces same type too?

[01:17] <eternaleye> One thing that might be nice would be some sugar for 'subclasses not allowed' .oO( :( ::T $a, T! $b ) ? )

[01:17] <jnthn> Of course, so did mod...

[01:18] <jnthn> eternaleye: I'm sure that in an ideal Perl 6, that'd be possible in a module. :-)

[01:18] <colomon> div and mod enforce the same type, yes.

[01:19] <jnthn> colomon: So IIUC, the upshot is that essentially div and mod end up being constrainty rather than coercy versions of / and %?

[01:19] <colomon> jnthn: I think that's the idea. 

[01:20] <jnthn> colomon: Is that...actually useful? :-)

[01:20] <colomon> but my complaint is that (as I understand the definition of div), mod is useless for non-integer types.

[01:21] <colomon> jnthn: I have no idea if constrainty versions are useful.

[01:21] *** masonkramer_ is now known as masonkramer

[01:22] <colomon> Going backwards --- div on Ints returns an Int instead of a Rat.

[01:22] <colomon> that makes sense.

[01:22] <jnthn> OK, and makes it useful.

[01:23] <jnthn> Since it gives you a distinct result from /

[01:26] <jnthn> So it seems that at least for div it's more useful than "this just constrains"

[01:26] <colomon> right, I'm cool with that.

[01:26] <colomon> it's mod that's got me shaking my head.

[01:26] <jnthn> Yeah

[01:27] <jnthn> I can see the problem, but I'm not sure what a fix would be.

[01:27] <colomon> me neither.

[01:28] <jnthn> Int $limit = * # parameter declaration FAIL

[01:28] <jnthn> (because * !~~ Int)

[08:31] <moritz_> it seems that wxwidgets already acts as an abstraction layer for GUI toolkits

[08:31] <moritz_> so when you interface wxwidgets, you already have gtk support too

[08:32] <Su-Shee> yes. and another bad looking, clunky gui application giving "GUI" a bad name. ;)

[08:35] <Su-Shee> moritz_: it's supposedly "native" looking to either the OS or the toolkit binding, but it's usally slightly off. it's not really nice to code and doesn't support actually thriving for a really good gui. 

[08:36] *** [particle] left
[08:38] <moritz_> so, why is it less awesome than DBI for databases?

[08:38] <moritz_> is it because the APIs are too different in structure?

[08:39] <Su-Shee> err.. well that's not just comparing apples to pears but apples to .. steaks :) 

[08:39] <moritz_> well, both can be tasty

[08:39] <mathw> GUI toolkits don't seem to deal with abstraction layers very well

[08:39] <mathw> they've all got their particular things

[08:39] <Su-Shee> a good gui is usally more than an abstraction in the visuals of a button or a menu. 

[08:40] <mathw> and to make a GUI look good, you usually need full access to the core library

[08:40] <Su-Shee> exactly. 

[08:40] <mathw> also because different platforms and toolkits have different UI guidelines and different things work well

[08:40] <mathw> and their widgets never precisely map in capabilities or behaviour

[08:41] <Su-Shee> also, there's at least two schools of "GUI" - being _extremely_ flexible and able to tweak down to the last pixel or "trying to be standarized"

[08:41] <mathw> I like standardised to a certain extent

[08:41] <mathw> but sometimes a good specialist UI is better

[08:42] <Su-Shee> indeed. also, the standarized tks got old over the last 5-8 years. and not in a good way. features are missing which web nowadays can do. and that's bad. 

[08:42] *** jjore left
[08:43] <Su-Shee> not to mention that programming GUI is complex and requires much work. 

[08:43] <moritz_> that I know :-)

[08:44] <Su-Shee> and you really _need_ a widget set either being _very_ good or - if not - then very flexible so you can do your own stuff. 

[08:44] <moritz_> well, I think with Perl 6 we're still in the "embrace" phase from "embrace and extend"

[08:44] <Su-Shee> also there seem to be only a handful of variations how widget sets are used (programming-wise). 

[08:45] <Su-Shee> ok and then there is X ;) 

[08:47] <mathw> I don't think we're going to revolutionise GUI programming any time soon

[08:47] <mathw> Let's deal with the underlying language first :)

[08:47] <Su-Shee> and your audience is extremely ungrateful. ;) everybody wants a really good gui, smooth to use, fast, not too shiny and not too shabby, extremely flexible but also totally simple.. ;) 

[08:47] <mathw> although of course GUI programming with Perl 6 will be joyful

[09:04] <moritz_> "Indeed, many of the conjectures (or, in physics lingo, ‚Äúresults‚Äù) in this area that the physicists derived using their hocus-pocus methods, were later rigorously confirmed by the mathematicians"

[09:05] *** _jaldhar_ left
[09:05] *** jaldhar joined
[09:09] <moritz_> it's true; many papers in physics rely on hairy asumptions, so it's a small miracle that not more of them turn out to be outright wrong later on

[09:12] <masak> we have a similar division in the computer world between people who use algorithms/heuristics which haven't been proven efficient, and those who spend their time proving algorithms efficient.

[09:13] *** clintongormley joined
[09:13] <masak> or any other property besides efficiency. correctness, even.

[09:13] <moritz_> aye

[09:13] <moritz_> sadly most programming time isn't about algorithms

[09:14] <masak> true.

[09:16] <moritz_> if you're good, most programming time is about organizing data; if you're bad, it's about (mis)understanding language and library features, and suffering from not properly organizing the data

[09:17] <moritz_> at least that's my impression from following perlmonks

[09:17] <masak> I still think about the von Neumann bottleneck sometimes. whether it's real, whether we've overcome it in some concrete sense, or whether we will.

[09:20] <moritz_> from my limited experience I'd say it's real, and it's somewhat lessened by various cache tricks

[09:21] <moritz_> actually that's wrong; I've seen lots of cases where I thought that fetching memory is the bottleneck

[09:21] <moritz_> but I've never really seen a proof for that

[09:24] <masak> I find caching deeply interesting. a friend of mine works with such things.

[09:25] <Su-Shee> if gui is involved,most programming time (about 40%) is about the gui. :/

[11:18] <masak> moritz_: not only the shebang line of the 'ufo' script would need to be changed, but also the location of the PERL6 binary.

[11:19] <masak> moritz_: I've been thinking of putting in a command-line option to enable Makefiles to be created with 'alpha' as the binary. maybe I should generalize that to accepting an arbitrary path for which perl6 binary to use in the make process.

[11:19] *** ispeak_ left
[11:23] <jnthn> masak: General flag sounds useful. Encouraging people to keep using alpha less so. :-)

[11:23] <moritz_> masak: PERL6=perl6 is the current state, and works here

[11:24] <masak> moritz_: oh, good.

[11:24] <masak> so maybe --use-alpha is enough, and then we can deprecate it.

[11:40] <masak> ok, so there's this person 'ank' who doesn't particularly like Perl 6. he replies to me on Twitter sometimes with comments mainly intended to hurt. yesterday he wrote in an old comment thread on one of my blog posts: http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=44783&cid=72022

[11:41] <masak> I have many things I could reply to that, but I don't think it's a good idea for me to write to the guy at all. it'll only make me sad, long term. if someone else wants to reply to him, feel free.

[11:42] <masak> just don't waste the whole day on him.

[11:42] <moritz_> masak: ignore it

[11:42] <ruoso> bom dia #perl6

[11:42] <moritz_> doesn't make sense to reply to personal attacks from strangers on the internet

[11:42] <masak> moritz_: indeed. I am ignoring him.

[11:43] <masak> but I'm kinda flattered to be counted in a group of three along with TimToady and chromatic. :)

[11:43] <masak> also a bit flattered that he apparently reads my blog posts and their comment threads.

[11:43] <colomon> Wait, I get to be one of masak's homies?!  Awesome!

[11:44] <masak> :P

[11:44] <colomon> I love how he says "won't acknowledge it."  Well, no, it's directly contrary to one of the core Perl 6 design ideas.

[11:44] *** rv2733 joined
[11:44] <moritz_> it's actually contrary to perl 5 design ideas too

[11:44] <moritz_> but perl 5 wasn't quite as consequent as Perl 6 is (hopefully :-)

[11:44] <masak> the author of the comment also authored http://www.ank.com.ar/jade7/ -- a joke which ends up being mostly tasteless and immature.

[11:45] <moritz_> he seems to invest quite some energy

[11:46] <moritz_> unlike the traditional troll

[11:46] <masak> yes. apparently he doesn't feel he's getting through to TimToady, so he chooses other ways to express himself.

[11:53] <colomon> Actually, the funny thing about the comment is how he tries to sneak "well-defined" in there.

[11:54] <masak> in Moscow, I heard the phrase 'the famous masak". I replied that they must be mistaken, and that I'm not famous, just loud.

[11:54] <colomon> I mean, I'd argue that p6's operators are well-defined precisely because there are so many of them.

[11:54] <colomon> there's a difference between being famous and being loud?  ;)

[11:54] <moritz_> masak: famous = loud + somebody hears you being loud

[11:55] <masak> moritz_: :)

[11:55] <moritz_> traditionally people got famous by other people talking about them

[11:55] <masak> moritz_: people are most likely thinking of you when they hear my name. :)

[11:55] <moritz_> with the internet it's possible to be famous by talking, and having readers

[11:55] <colomon> moritz_: ooo, good point.  loud + no one cares is pretty much just a pathetic troll.  ;)

[11:56] <moritz_> masak: why should they?

[11:57] <masak> moritz_: I'm making that up now.

[11:57] <sbp> "and that I'm not famous, just loud"

[11:57] <moritz_> masak: thought so

[11:57] <sbp> what's the difference? :-)

[11:57] <masak> moritz_: but I see people mixing us up here on the channel now and then.

[11:57] <moritz_> jnthn: akshually they are like verbs... but I don't have to tell you that

[11:57] <masak> moritz_: so most likely you're the famous one, and I'm just the loud one. :P

[11:57] <colomon> hell, I've mixed you up a few times myself.

[11:57] <sbp> oh, I didn't see the fame algebra beneath

[11:57] <moritz_> masak: I'm mixing us up too... :-)

[11:58] <jnthn> moritz_: Yeah, I know. Linguistic grasp fail...

[11:58] <masak> moritz_: me too!

[12:04] <moritz_> the book has sidenodes, which are rendered less-than-awesome

[12:04] <cognominal> but I had to go to the source to  understand what it was about.

[12:05] <moritz_> could be a challenge to come up with latex code for nice side bar rendering

[12:05] <moritz_> + as a bonus hack it into Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX

[12:05] <cognominal> And the lack of decent syntactical highlighting makes difficult to skim perl 6.

[12:06] <mathw> masak: pong

[12:06] <cosimo> moritz_: I thought of doing the very same thing for synopsis documents and smartlinks

[12:07] <cosimo> the way they are interspersed with the synopsis text is making it a bit difficult to follow the text

[12:07] <cosimo> I can try to have a look at that, if someone else cares

[12:07] <moritz_> I do care

[12:08] <moritz_> and I think that the inline, hilighted test files can go away

[12:17] <masak> worst thing that can happen is that you'll be the only one remaining on the 'human tech' list :P

[12:18] <masak> colomon: 'only working on integer types'. what's the failure mode -- coercion, or runtime error?

[12:19] <colomon> I'd argue runtime error.

[12:19] <cognominal> masak: not really, I just hope that all your tools will be integrated in a whole, each being a point in the big whole.  Right now, it is like seeing a pointillist painting point by point even if each point is a world in itself.

[12:19] <masak> colomon: because operators in Perl generally tend to coerce rather than error out.

[12:20] <colomon> The spec already specifies that those two don't coerce.

[12:20] <mathw> masak: from the look of it, it doesn't look like it's going to be too hard to do the convert anyway

[12:20] <mathw> I take it you have to rerun ufo if your directory structure changes

[12:20] <colomon> I think they have a very specific use, and if you're not there already, you shouldn't be using them.

[12:21] <colomon> though I can see an argument that they should handle mixing different integer types.... hmmm...

[12:21] <masak> cognominal: it's the small, rapid solutions which seem to succeed in the long term. I agree about it being important to unify them, but since no-one can see the whole yet, that will have to wait a bit. :)

[12:25] <cognominal> masak:  emergent design... something in between dartwinist evolution and  intelligent design. Quite appropriate for most human endeavors.

[12:26] <masak> cognominal: I often find that parts of the Perl 6 effort are similar in structure to the Perl 6 effort itself. that probably goes for many communities. but Perl 6 as a whole is definitely emergent/whirlpool, with implementations informing the spec etc.

[12:41] <moritz_> jnthn: hum. Yeah. How... suprising

[12:41] <jnthn> moritz_: Well, if the rule is "what follows the name behaves exactly like the same circumfix would anywhere else"...it's not so surprising.

[12:42] <moritz_> you're right

[12:43] <pmurias> ruoso: should the definitions of functions in smop headers have export?

[12:43] <masak> so it should be a block?

[12:43] <pmurias> like export int foo(void);

[12:48] <mathw> moritz_: It's been a while since I read S02 all the way through

[13:19] <pmurias> ruoso: what i'm implementing atm, is ++BACKEND --option-for-backend ... ++/BACKEND as invented by S19

[13:20] <pmurias> so we can have ++BACKEND --trace ++/BACKEND and ++BACKEND --valgrind ++/BACKEND

[13:21] <ruoso> I see... is that particular feature close to finish?

[13:21] <pmurias> yes

[13:21] <ruoso> okay... then I'd suggest getting back to "releasing SMOP/mildew to CPAN" per se

[13:22] <ruoso> and adding extra features later, if time is available

[13:22] <mberends> hi #perl6. After a little more work on FakeDBI, I plan to write some serious production code to use it: a little accounting or bookkeeping program, for my own small business. Anyone who is interested will be welcome to begin collaborating when the work begins, maybe as early as next week.

[13:23] * moritz_ loves to hear of production uses of Perl 6

[13:23] <pmurias> ruoso: the things that blocks me in releasing SMOP is that the code mildew turns m0ld into segfaults

[13:23] <moritz_> mberends: how close is FakeDBI to being a subset of perl 5 DBI?

[13:23] *** Woody2143 left
[13:24] <mberends> moritz_: it's already CRUD complete, the rest is all optional bells and whistles

[13:25] <pmurias> ruoso: so i want to port of the debuging aids from the old mildew to the new refactored one

[13:25] <moritz_> mberends: my question is more: does it contain incompatible API changes, apart from things that are NYI or not planned or due to the difference between Perl 5 and 6

[13:25] <jnthn> Sheesh, what is it with people in Lund and loud horns today... :S

[13:25] <moritz_> (imagine a question mark at appropriate place)

[13:27] <mberends> moritz_: no differences between P5 and P6. It really does work to simply replace -> with . and $arr[...] with @arr[...] and keep everything else unchanged so far.

[13:28] <moritz_> mberends: ok, thanks

[23:37] <sorear> it's actually quite legitimate that they only allow Safari, because what it's actually demonstrating is HTML5's vendor namespace feature

[23:38] *** jhuni joined
[23:38] <lue> It doesn't matter. You don't say "Look at our support for HTML5" and then make it safari-only

[23:39] <lue> I ought to tell them about their false advertisment

[23:39] <lue> i.e. "...Not all browsers offer this support...."

[23:39] <jnthn> lue: Didn't do custom circumfixes just yet...but that error message is crap.

[23:39] <arnsholt> Heh. Adding parametrised type constraints to my code caused Rakudo to segfault

[23:39] <arnsholt> Whoops

[23:40] <lue> If you notice, that was base pairings, and I wanted a mismatch or missing "G" error :)

[23:40] <jnthn> arnsholt: ugh.

[23:43] <jnthn> Array of Str probably won't work too well ATM

[23:44] <jnthn> Also though, Array of Str means every element in @foo would be an Array, if it did work.

[23:44] <arnsholt> Point

[23:44] <arnsholt> (In this case I even want Array of Str @arr)

[23:44] <arnsholt> Even if I wrote it Array of Array of Str @arr before you pointed that out

[23:45] <arnsholt> But type parameters are parsed but not checked, no?

[23:46] <jnthn> arnsholt: They are checked, AFAIK.
