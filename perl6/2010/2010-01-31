[04:11] <spinclad> erg.  at 22:55:19 i lose my connection to irc.freenode.net, i'm reconnected by 22:55:55 (to calvino) but NickServ doesn't come back till 23:05, so i'm not identified till i repeat my identify /msg later, and #perl6 says:

[04:11] <spinclad> 22:55:57 [freenode] -!- #perl6 Cannot join channel (+j) - throttle exceeded, try again later

[04:13] <spinclad> i'm not sure what correlates with what there, but a number of people have mentioned the like for them.

[06:18] <diakopter> in the statically-typed subset of Perl 6 I'm implementing in Sprixel, I'm trying to decide how to reify continuations.

[06:28] *** Baggiokwok joined
[06:32] <diakopter> I suppose the simplest technique is to provide two statement prefixes: return-cc returns a continuation with the result of the prefixed statement stashed in it (analogous to C#'s yield, most useful for iterators/generators), and call-cc that invokes a closure passing in the current continuation as the sole argument.

[06:34] <diakopter> I guess yield-cc is a more appropriate name for the first one

[10:32] <tmosx> Hello everybody: i don't know if this room is for helping or not. i tried to write to #perl room and i couldn't. the following couple lines in the link above are giving me a headache.

[10:33] <tmosx> basically. i'm trying to check if a subdirectory is existing in my current directory or not. if it exists then i will write an image in that subdirectory. ( note: i'm using Image Magick )

[10:33] <tmosx> any help would be appreciated.

[10:33] <huf> you're checking if it exists in /

[10:34] <huf> but mkdir-ing it in your current dir

[10:34] <huf> but then opening it in /. but then passing $file wrong to the Write method

[10:34] <huf> and anyway, this is a channel for perl6, not perl5.

[10:34] <huf> you should be able to join #perl, altho you may need to ident with freenode

[10:35] <huf> oh, and dont use the 2-arg form of open

[10:35] <tmosx> i tried to do that .. but it still gave me an error message telling me that i can't write to the group.

[10:36] <tmosx> oh, i see. thank you very much. i'll probably try to write #perl one more time.

[10:36] <tmosx> thanks huf!

[12:12] <lichtkind> when got rakudo birth 2,5 jears ago?

[12:16] * ruoso very happy with the latest spec changes... 

[12:17] <ruoso> at the same time I don't like the "magical return" from the iterator, the way it is described now is much more sane... 

[12:17] <ruoso> since it's just an unthrown exception

[12:17] <ruoso> (which might be thrown if "use fatal" is in effect)

[12:18] *** LaVolta joined
[12:19] <ruoso> and the simplification of the latest change (r29602) makes a very good simplification...

[12:23] <moritz_> I'm a bit confused by   @(1,2 Z 3,4)      # ((1,3),(2,4))

[12:23] <moritz_> does that mean that for 1, 2 Z 3, 4 -> $a { say 1 }; produces only two lines?

[12:23] <moritz_> or does the iteration over (1, 3), (2, 4) flatten it?

[12:24] <sjohnson> ruoso: do you code in K&R / C99 c, for SMOP?

[12:24] <colomon> sjohnson: what's your C question?  I might be able to help...

[12:25] <ruoso> sjohnson, I think there's nothing exoterical in SMOP code... maybe some of the modules require something special...

[12:25] <ruoso> moritz_, signature binding flattens...

[12:26] <ruoso> (unless the signature says otherwise)

[12:28] <sjohnson> colomon: i'm about to learn C, and i keep seeing all these new standards

[12:29] <sjohnson> i have the K&R C book, but it almost looks as though i should learn the newest standard, and ignore K&R.  it is confusing

[12:29] <ruoso> in the end, I keep with whatever gcc compiles

[12:29] <sjohnson> there's C99 and C1X that i worry about

[12:30] <colomon> sjohnson: ah, interesting question.  as far as I know, K&R is terribly out of date.  But it is considered a classic.

[12:30] <ruoso> since gcc is cross-platform and free software, I usually consider it the standard I follow

[12:32] <vorner> sjohnson: if you learn ANSI C or C99, the C1X will probably just add new nice features

[12:32] <vorner> and you can test C99 right away, but the new one won't be implemented by now yet, I guess (not that I would keep a close look)

[12:32] <colomon> sjohnson: I wouldn't worry much about C99 or C1X, they just tweak details without changing the core of the language at all.

[12:32] <colomon> like going from Perl 5.6 to Perl 5.8 or so.

[12:33] <colomon> not at all like going from Perl 5.6 to Perl 6.  :)

[12:33] *** payload joined
[12:33] <vorner> but C99 just added some details to ANSI C (like better initializers, macros with arbitrary number of parameters)

[12:35] <colomon> sjohnson: unfortunately, I'm not much good for recommending a book: I learned C about 21 years ago, and don't have the faintest memory of what text I used to do it.  (Actually, I don't remember learning it at all, I just remember coding some C to get the tape punch hardware to run, and then learning C++ the weekend I came back to the dorm.)

[12:36] <sjohnson> vorner: how does one learn C99?  just learn K&R C, and then learn the differences?  or start from C99 somehow

[12:36] <sjohnson> colomon: thanks anyway.  do you prefer C++?

[12:36] <colomon> sjohnson: Yes.  Wildly so, actually.

[12:37] <sjohnson> is the STL a good thing?

[12:38] <colomon> sjohnson: yes.  It's still terribly clumsy compared to, say, Perl arrays and hashes, but it's lightyears beyond programming in C.

[12:39] <vorner> sjohnson: Hm, don't know. I started by learning from a czech textbook of ansi-C, using it for some time, then learning some of the fancy things of C99 on the university from friends

[12:39] <sjohnson> this is an intersting topic of discussion

[12:40] <vorner> colomon: But C++ is inconsistent at places, STL is pain in the ass to debug, and if you learn C and preprocessor well enough, can be easilly got rid of.

[12:41] <sjohnson> ruoso: please to join the convo

[12:41] <sjohnson> :)

[12:41] <colomon> vorner: IMO you're verging on insanity there.

[12:42] <sjohnson> easy now.  i know some people who prefer C over the C++ STL

[12:42] <sjohnson> the author of uTorrent being one of them

[12:42] <colomon> something like std::map packs a fantastic amount of sophisticated tech into a (relatively) easy to learn package.

[12:43] <vorner> colomon: well, I tried it. Generics in C preprocessor aren't really that hard to do. But anyway, C is for low-level or power computing, C++ adds things that do not belong there (like exceptions to language without GC)

[12:44] <moritz_> if you show me how the compile-time folding and SSE vectorization of the "eigen" library in C, I might even believe that it works

[12:44] <moritz_> *works in C

[12:44] <sjohnson> moritz_: what is your preference?

[12:45] <moritz_> sjohnson: the most appropriate tool for the job

[12:45] <moritz_> depending on the job, that's often enough Perl

[12:45] <sjohnson> moritz_: i've definitely found Perl does 99% of what i need

[12:45] <sjohnson> but i need to do some power-programming for libs for a Clipper compiler

[12:45] <sjohnson> which allows C

[12:47] <sjohnson> .. and curious what your thoughts were

[12:48] *** cotto left
[12:48] <sjohnson> *puppy dog eyes*

[12:48] <moritz_> if it allows C, use C

[12:49] <sjohnson> but do you like C or C++, for those jobs?

[12:49] <moritz_> depends on the job

[12:49] <moritz_> neither "power-programming" nor "for libs for a Clipper compiler" tells me enough to chose a language

[12:50] *** cotto joined
[12:50] * vorner knows both of them and avoids them both if there is a reasonable way

[12:50] <ruoso> I started in C for real some months before I started on SMOP

[12:50] <colomon> virtually everything I write that doesn't have to be deliverable to a customer is in Perl.  :)

[12:51] <ruoso> I had some contact around 98... but never really worked with C

[12:51] <sjohnson> well.. i was more asking about your affection for the languages moritz_.  for instance, i LOVE perl, but will use PHP for other tasks, but i dont like PHP... just wondering if you liked / enjoyed either C / C++

[12:51] <ruoso> which is quite understandable, since I worked all the time with information systems (where Perl is far a better choice)

[12:52] <moritz_> sjohnson: then I'll tell you that I love Perl. If I can't use Perl, I chose the language that's most appropriate :-)

[12:52] <sjohnson> haha

[12:52] <sjohnson> i think i understand

[12:52] * ruoso can't find a single reason to use PHP

[12:52] <sjohnson> either Perl... or drudgery is how i look at it

[12:52] <sjohnson> ruoso: i use it for really simple inline HTML generation...

[12:52] <vorner> sjohnson: I like C to play with sometimes, like „how low I can get memory consumption for this task“, or „how fast I can generate first 500 000 000 primes“, but not for real „bigger“ jobs. Most my bigger things are either C++/Qt or bunch of languages put randomly together.

[12:52] <sjohnson> i dont quite know how to do it in Perl yet

[12:53] <ruoso> sjohnson, template toolkit... or even mason...

[12:54] <sjohnson> ok

[12:54] <sjohnson> will do some research

[12:54] <sjohnson> ive used the CGI thing before

[12:55] <sjohnson> but i found it a bit tedious

[12:55] <ruoso> ah... that's at least 10 years old

[12:58] <ruoso> take a look at Catalyst

[12:58] <ruoso> sjohnson, that's how I work with web in Perl today

[12:59] <sjohnson> interesting

[12:59] <sjohnson> this is good news

[13:00] *** payload left
[13:02] * vorner will have to look at catalyst, all his websites are either mostly staticly generated with few CGI scripts either in perl or sh or in mod_perl
