[07:43] <isBEKaml> java runtime? why don't I see the author here than just the '++' :)

[07:44] <sorear> it's mberends, but dalek fails as usual on it

[07:44] <mberends> isBEKaml: my git settings are slightly br0ken on this project

[07:44] <isBEKaml> mberends! awesome. :)

[07:44] <mberends> other projects work fine from the same computer

[07:45] <mberends> I like the ascii art in the Makefile :)

[07:45] <moritz_> mberends: usually it's fine to have username and email in the global git config, and no user/email in the per-repo config at all

[07:45] <sorear> mberends: you are familiar with the way dalek gets nicknames, right?

[07:46] * sorear achieves Enlightenment Level 1 with the nqp-rx parser engine

[07:47] *** zulon left
[07:51] <mberends> moritz_, sorear: I'm totally ignorant about dalek's workings. I have only global git settings and they work with other projects (rakudo etc). Also 6model commits displayed fine initially but dalek began dropping my ID after a while. The 6model git log still records my name the same as before. I can't be bothered much to look into it right now, in a few days I'll be at home and will try pushing from a clone on another computer.

[07:53] <moritz_> mberends: I also noticed that git log showed your name correctly. (which is why I wondered why you attributed it your git config, not dalek)

[07:53] <isBEKaml> mberends: I think you'll have to look at user.name and user.email listings in git config --list

[07:54] <mberends> isBEKaml: just checked, and it's only global user.name and user.email. :-(

[07:55] <isBEKaml> mberends: I think if your commits show up properly int he logs, it's dalek that's the problem not your config settings. 

[07:55] <moritz_> curl http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/commits/list/jnthn/6model/master

[07:55] <moritz_> shows that the 'login' field is empty

[07:55] <moritz_> which I don't understand

[07:56] <moritz_> mberends: ah, you use a different email address than that registered with github

[07:57] <moritz_> (github vs. mberends) @ autoexec.demon.nl

[07:57] <moritz_> maybe that causes github not to recognize your commits as coming from the 'mberends' github account

[07:58] <isBEKaml> moritz_: I'm curious. I can see mberend's commits in the git repo logs I just cloned. 

[07:59] <isBEKaml> moritz_: even the email you refer to is seen to the same in the git logs and the curl output. 

[07:59] <isBEKaml> or am I missing something?

[08:00] <moritz_> isBEKaml: but it's not the one you see on http://github.com/mberends/

[08:00] <moritz_> isBEKaml: and since git allows you to push other people's commits, there has to be a way to map the commits back to a nickname

[08:00] <mberends> moritz_: that makes a lot of sense. I should rename my global user.email to github@autoexec, it's part of my spam management strategy.

[08:00] <moritz_> s/nickname/github login/

[08:01] <moritz_> I've also asked Infinoid to make the author info fallback to the name if login is empty

[08:02] <isBEKaml> moritz_: ah, makes sense. gravatars and email mapping. 

[08:07] <isBEKaml> mberends: is there any reason you have put xml like entries in a string of single line comments?

[08:07] <isBEKaml> mberends: I kind of find that distracting when looking over the java code. :)

[08:08] *** zulon joined
[08:09] <mberends> isBEKaml: I usually prefer a mx line length of 72 chars (for POD etc) but this was trying to deviate as little as possible from the C# original. So I blame jnthn++ ;)

[08:09] *** wamba joined
[08:10] <isBEKaml> mberends: if you're trying to document the methods that are there in the java code, you're probably better off with javadoc comments unless you want to generate pods from them. :)

[08:11] <isBEKaml> mberends: also, you can use /* ... */ multiline comments. /// is rather distracting to code-reading. 

[08:12] <mberends> isBEKaml: so I agree with you, I don't like the long lines either. I do plan to improve the comments. It's nice to be motivated by knowing people like you are reading them :-)

[08:14] <sorear> aha

[08:15] <sorear> using github's data is _so much smarter_

[08:15] <sorear> back before the move to github api, dalek got usernames by scraping CREDITS

[08:15] <sorear> parrot's CREDITS.

[08:15] <sorear> no matter what project you were on

[08:16] <isBEKaml> mberends: I was only curious when I was cloning the repo. But now I'm interested! =)

[08:16] <tylercurtis> Good night, #perl6.

[08:17] <mberends> isBEKaml: jnthn++ has been above average in commenting his C# code, but to me it is still not explanatory enough. After I've hacked some more code to 1) compile, and 2) run? I'll definitely add more docs.

[08:17] <isBEKaml> mberends: I cannot speak for C#, but I sure can help around with java. 

[08:18] <mberends> isBEKaml: cool! Patches Welcome (tm) as always :)

[08:23] <isBEKaml> mberends++ I will try going over it sometime. If I do "get" something, you'll definitely see me pushing patches! :)

[08:24] <isBEKaml> s/pushing/\1 git pull/

[08:24] <mberends> isBEKaml: an interesting "challenge" is guessing what is in some of the files that jnthn has not committed yet, but uses on the dotnet side ;)

[08:25] <isBEKaml> mberends: not committed yet? 

[08:25] <isBEKaml> I don't understand. 

[08:26] <isBEKaml> mberends: Ah, mind reading and anticipation! :D

[08:26] <mberends> isBEKaml: in the dotnet/ tree there are references to classes for which no source files have been pushed.

[08:27] * mberends must show jnthn the 'git status' command some time

[08:35] <isBEKaml> mberends: your makefile is pretty weird. you have added every class as a target in it. 

[08:35] <isBEKaml> mberends: why not just compile them all together? or simpler, use ant?

[08:36] <mberends> isBEKaml: I'm trying to keep things portable for Windows nmake, which is not as clever as GNU make.

[08:37] <isBEKaml> mberends: No, that is not what I meant. javac has some switches that enable you to compile all classes. 

[08:37] <isBEKaml> mberends: ant works fine on windows too.

[08:39] <mberends> isBEKaml: I'll look into it, unless you beat me to it. But if ant is an extra dependency to install on Windows, I'm reluctant to add that to the beginner's requirements list.

[08:41] <isBEKaml> mberends: every java user would know about ant i think. Besides, I don't think you're going to allow the end user to build classes themselves, right? YOu're only going to provide the compiled binaries. So it's just a build dependency.

[08:46] <mberends> isBEKaml: yes Ant is well known.  The beginner developer may or may not have it, and so far I do not mind maintaining a few extra Makefile lines to lower the barrier to getting started. I hope jnthn will soon be trying to compile the java code, and I'd rather not hassle him with needing to install Ant if he doesn't have it yet.

[10:00] <TiMBuS> is .so still part of the perl 6 spec?

[10:00] <TiMBuS> there's already .Bool and prefix:<?>

[10:00] <moritz_> rakudo: say 3.so

[10:00] <p6eval> rakudo a20e62: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[10:03] <TiMBuS> or is .Bool not the proper way to do it

[10:03] * moritz_ would be fine with removing .s

[10:03] <moritz_> .so

[10:04] <moritz_> but since it's spec, I've implemented it

[10:04] <TiMBuS> hmm

[10:04] <TiMBuS> rakudo: say (my @a).so

[10:04] <p6eval> rakudo a20e62: OUTPUT¬´0‚ê§¬ª

[10:05] <TiMBuS> oh right, thats different to what i was thinking

[10:05] <p6eval> rakudo a20e62: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§¬ª

[10:07] <TiMBuS> also, is there a reason behind .Bool and .Str being Ucfirst as opposed to .list and .hash?

[10:10] *** risou_ left
[10:12] *** risou_ joined
[10:13] <moritz_> I guess it's because .list and .hash refer to syntactic forms

[10:13] <moritz_> @() -> .list,  %() -> .hash

[10:13] <moritz_> not sure if that's a good reason though

[10:35] <sorear> TiMBuS: in S13 or S14, .(type name) is how Perl 6 does explicit coercions

[10:35] <sorear> right now it's just a convention but we plan to tie it into my Int $x and similar... eventually... somehow...

[10:36] <sorear> Bool and Str are type names

[10:36] <TiMBuS> as is Hash and List

[10:36] <moritz_> it's used by the sub f ($x as Int) { ... }   syntax

[10:36] <sorear> %() does not return a Hash, @() does not return a List

[10:36] <TiMBuS> er.

[10:37] <moritz_> what does it return? Associative and Positional?

[10:37] <sorear> in the former case, I think so

[10:38] <sorear> but that's not central to the purpose of either operator

[10:39] <sorear> e.g. Match ~~ Associative, but %($/) is emphatically not the same as $/

[10:39] <moritz_> STD.pm6 line 2376: <[\@\%\&]> # is there a good reason for those backslasshes?

[10:39] <sorear> (if it was, why would the %() special case exist)

[10:39] <moritz_> sorear: good point

[10:39] <TiMBuS> well calling the method forms .hash and .list was probably incorrect then

[10:39] <sorear> TiMBuS: no, they're contextualizers, look at S02 again

[10:40] <moritz_> how would you name them?

[10:40] <sorear> moritz_: perl 5 character classes are double quotish interpolating

[10:41] <moritz_> but STD.pm6 is suposed to be Perl 6, no?

[10:41] <TiMBuS> if .hash doesnt make a Hash, it shouldnt be .hash? im not sure what I would call it

[10:41] <sorear> TiMBuS: .hash is the contextualizer for hash context.  calling it anything else would be wrong

[10:42] <sorear> moritz_: I am not going to touch the viv character class translator

[10:42] <moritz_> so it's a hack. Ok

[10:42] <TiMBuS> .hashify

[10:42] <TiMBuS> hashualize

[10:43] <sorear> hashualize context is questionable grammar

[10:43] <moritz_> gesundheit!

[10:43] <TiMBuS> well fine we can add hasualise as well :p

[17:12] <tylercurtis> TimToady: I saw it in the backlog. I hadn't thought about evals. Thanks.

[17:12] <moritz_> grondilu: I don't know one either; but would be nice to have one :-)

[17:12] <grondilu> I could try it, but I'm not an expert and I don't want to do it if someone already did.

[17:13] <TimToady> not even for the learning experience?  :)

[17:13] <grondilu> yes, sure

[17:13] <moritz_> nobody starts out as an expert :-)

[17:13] <moritz_> if you want some advice, start with *very* simple grammar, improve it step by step, and test it after each step

[17:14] <TimToady> and start by only writing tokens, not rules

[17:14] <grondilu> ok

[17:14] <TimToady> people get into trouble with implicit whitespace matching

[17:14] <moritz_> since the debugging facilities for grammars are somewhat limited, that's the only way not to get stuck with frustration

[17:15] <grondilu> so far I have the perl6 book :  http://github.com/downloads/perl6/book/2010.08.a4.pdf.  Will this doc be enough for me to start ?

[17:16] <moritz_> yes; if you know some Perl 5, http://perlgeek.de/en/article/5-to-6 might be good additional information

[17:16] <TimToady> knowledge of how to grep the synopses is also quite helpful

[17:17] <grondilu> "synopses" ?

[17:17] <TimToady> the specs

[17:17] <moritz_> and don't hesitate to come back here and ask questions

[17:17] <TimToady> http://perlcabal.org/syn/

[17:19] <Juerd> grondilu: It's probably impossible to do everything mediawiki does with a clean grammar, given the way it's parsed by the php code.

[17:20] <TimToady> that's what dirty grammars are for :)

[17:20] <TimToady> we have those too...

[17:20] <TimToady> .oO(STD)

[17:20] <grondilu> well if I could do 90%, that will be fine.

[17:20] *** zulon left
[17:20] <grondilu> I'll just verbatim the rest.

[17:21] <Juerd> grondilu: In any case, I'd love to see a mediawiki grammar emerge

[17:21] <Juerd> And then wiki software. And then... :)

[17:21] <TimToady> ...profit

[17:21] <moritz_> I don't know much about mediawiki syntax; but for some formats it's also a good idea to split up on empty lines first, and then parse the chunks separately

[17:22] <Juerd> moritz_: Not so for MW, IIRC

[17:23] <grondilu> that wouldn't work for ''' and '' (bold and italic format) for instance, I'm afraid.  Since several paragraphs can be enclosed in a '' or ''' pair.

[17:23] <Juerd> Paragraphs are separated by empty lines, but not everything is a paragraph

[17:24] <TimToady> grammars can certainly heed/ignore line boundaries at need

[17:25] <grondilu> so I guess we can't use empy lines as separator for anything else than paragraphs.

[17:25] <moritz_> Juerd, grondilu: that's why I warned that I don't know mediawiki syntax enough :-)

[17:26] *** molaf left
[17:27] <TimToady> Perl 6 grammars are not restricted to context-free.

[17:27] <grondilu> A good mediawiki example would be the Wikipedia:SandBox page I guess.  I'll make my experiments on that.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SandBox

[20:00] *** Packetknife left
[20:01] <TimToady> course, that probably means it can be done with signature matching as well

[20:01] <diakopter> the Python functional solution could be golfed, I think

[20:01] <dalek> rakudo: reset $*IN_DECL for regex bodies

[20:01] <dalek> rakudo: review: http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/d9aa575119292737ecc7e63d22da2070f03defa1

[20:02] <TimToady> yes, well, there are various approaches to either problem

[20:02] <TimToady> but a turtle's point of view is rather close to a human's

[20:04] * diakopter thinks about a grammar way

[20:04] <TimToady> so such a solution could be very readable, I suspect, assuming a good set of turtle primitives for moving around a matrix

[20:05] <diakopter> o wait

[20:05] * diakopter thinks about a flattening way

[20:06] <TimToady> basically, a turtle can keep egocentric directions, not just geographic

[20:06] <perigrin> Part of the Me Generation.

[20:06] <TimToady> and you can then turn the entire coordinate system merely by turning the turgle

[20:06] <TimToady> fsdo turgle

[20:07] * perigrin rummages around and finds a bag of 't's for TimToady so he won't have to replace them with g's anymore.

[20:07] <diakopter> turtles get squished all the time

[20:07] <perigrin> er 'g's

[20:07] <perigrin> diakopter: that's because they stack so well.

[20:07] <diakopter> :) esp the ones toward the bottom, yeah

[20:08] <TimToady> see also "Whorf Revisited", http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html?_r=1&ref=general&src=me&pagewanted=print

[20:08] <perigrin> yeah you can't fool me there ... there is no bottom ... it's turtles all the way down.

[20:09] <perigrin> ouch.

[20:10] <TimToady> not really, coffee has a velar, and tea only has a dental

[20:10] <patrickas> TimToady: Got a minute for a series spec question ?

[20:11] <TimToady> well, alveolar

[20:11] <diakopter> hah

[20:11] <TimToady> patrickas: well, yeah, though I'm overdue for lunch...

[20:11] <TimToady> if you don't mind munching sounds

[20:11] <patrickas> What should this produce ? (10,11,12,3,4,5,6,7...4) : Nil because rhs on the wrong side or (10,11,12,3,4) because lhs should get "processed" anyway ? 

[20:11] * diakopter thinks of "coffee" from Smash Bros

[20:12] <TimToady> I can argue that one both way, alas

[20:12] <patrickas> but I can't implement it both ways :-(

[20:13] <TimToady> the question is how far back the filtration of the end value goes

[20:14] <patrickas> the whole return Nil for rhs o nthe wrong side feels weird to me

[20:14] <patrickas> but I can see where it would make some sense

[20:15] <patrickas> but there are so many weird edge cases ... I had to give up on trying to reason it out on my own :-)

[20:15] <TimToady> I would prefer (10,11,12,3,4) myself

[20:15] *** stepnem left
[20:15] *** stepnem joined
[20:16] <patrickas> Well ... your preferences are my orders :-)

[20:16] <TimToady> the retroactive bit only works on intuited functions, anyway, I think, so it shouldn't go back further than the last 3 values, since those may be "tacked on" to a different sequence

[20:18] <patrickas> ok so I use the last three values to determin if on the wrong side

[20:18] <patrickas> but I also make sure that the rhs is not between any two items of the lhs

[20:19] <patrickas> does that seem reasonable enough ?

[20:19] * diakopter identifies the odd vs even distinction in the spiral matrix

[20:20] <patrickas> or do you mean i drop the whole check when the lhs has more than three items?

[20:20] *** timbunce joined
[20:20] <TimToady> "turn ($x++ %% 0 ?? left !! right)"

[20:20] <TimToady> %% 2 rather

[20:21] <TimToady> no, just apply to the last three values

[20:22] <patrickas> so in that case we get Nil because looking at the last three values ( 5,6,7 ) 4 is  on the wrong side

[20:22] <TimToady> the question is whether we've already returned anything in front of that irretrievably

[20:23] <TimToady> ^10, 5,6,7 ... 4

[20:24] <patrickas> yes I think that case should produce 0,1,2,3,4

[20:24] <patrickas> and the previous one 10,11,12,3,4

[20:26] <patrickas> but this means we are checking all items of the lhs to decide if 4 is on the wrong side .... otherwise result of the whole series op is just Nil

[20:26] <TimToady> why should that chop all the way back to the 4?  what if they really want 0..9 followed by 5,6,7...4

[20:27] <patrickas> precedence ?

[20:27] <patrickas> i my head ... has the lowest precedence

[20:27] <TimToady> well, higher than listops and such, but yes, pretty low

[20:27] <TimToady> I suppose they can always parenthesize

[20:28] <TimToady> which is the argument on the other side

[20:28] <patrickas> so you want (^10) , ( 5,6,7 ... 4) but you are asking for ( ^10 , 5,6,7 ) ... 4

[20:29] <patrickas> the major reason that is bothering me for not stipping at the first 4

[20:29] <patrickas> is things like the prime number generator series

[20:30] * patrickas trying to get it right

[20:32] <diakopter> TimToady: well, it's n is odd/even, not x or y on the grid

[20:32] *** M_o_C joined
[20:32] <diakopter> for me

[20:33] <TimToady> yes, that's why I incremented it myself

[20:34] <diakopter> hum

[20:36] <TimToady> re they NYT article, I speak an egocentric language, but my brain is nonetheless tracking directionality continually like a geographic language speaker

[20:36] <TimToady> it would not take me long to get used to speaking in a geographic language

[20:36] <TimToady> "turn north, the look east"

[20:37] <TimToady> "there's a spider crawling on your west arm"

[20:37] * patrickas I was wrong about the prime number thingy ... it does not have more than three items on the lhs

[20:39] *** Mowah joined
[20:39] <patrickas> I am inclined to check all of the lhs for on-the-wrong-side-ness but I have no strong feelings about it wither ways

[20:39] *** Ross left
[20:39] <TimToady> well, how do you know which side is wrong for 1, *+2 ... $x where $x == 0

[20:40] <TimToady> or $x == 2

[20:40] <patrickas> we do not do the check for "code" generated series

[20:40] <TimToady> have to

[20:40] <TimToady> @array[0, *+2 ... $max]

[20:40] <patrickas> only intuited ones

[20:41] <TimToady> mmm

[20:41] <patrickas> I dn't know I never thought about it ... I thought the spec was clear on this part

[20:41] <TimToady> it seems hard to argue that 0,2 ... $max is different from 0, *+2 ... $max

[20:42] <TimToady> esp when used as a subscript

[20:42] <patrickas> I thought the argument was whenever you have Code all bests are off ... since you could have something generating numbers .. somethign depending on io ....

[20:43] <patrickas> s/something generating numbers/something generating random numbers/

[20:46] <TimToady> but yeah, all my memories are tagged with the direction I was facing

[20:46] <patrickas> I wanted to say MABROUUUKKKKK but I thought it would sound to weird in here!

[20:46] <TimToady> if I have any visual memory, that is

[20:46] <patrickas> It just feels like I'd need to solve the halting problem first ... then I could check if the rhs in on the wrong side of the Code part... not sure if that's really the case though

[20:46] *** shade\ left
[20:48] <TimToady> we can certainly limit the inequality to intuited cases for now, and see how it goes

[20:49] <patrickas> ok..

[20:49] *** Ross joined
[20:50] <patrickas> and for the original question? intuited series with more than 3 items on the lhs ?

[20:50] *** shade\ joined
[20:52] <TimToady> the last three have to be literal, but the ones before that don't, so I'm still inclined to only treat the last three as part of the controlled list

[20:53] *** ruoso left
[20:53] <moritz_> rakudo: my $a = '.*'; say 'abc' ~~ / $a /

[20:53] <patrickas> parentisize!

[20:54] <TimToady> I suspect we might want to require the series intuiter to operator at compile time, not run time

[20:54] <patrickas> besides

[20:54] <patrickas> 1 .. 10, 9, 8 ... 1 will mean that in all cases

[20:54] <TimToady> so the above just gets compiled to 1 .. 10, 9, 8, *-1 ... 1

[20:55] <patrickas> At least regarding the "is on the wrong side issue"

[20:55] <TimToady> okay, ... 5

[20:55] <patrickas> because in that case the rhs is clearly not on the wrong side

[20:55] <TimToady> 1 .. 10, 9, 8, *-1 ... 5

[20:56] <patrickas> I see your point ... but that's another issue.

[20:58] *** Ross joined
[20:58] <TimToady> whether you get the 1,2,3 out

[20:59] * moritz_ has an interesting parsing question, but hesitates to hijack the current discussion

[20:59] <TimToady> directionality is determined from the final values 10 9 8, not the 1

[20:59] <patrickas> Yes ... this is another issue that needs to be discussed too

[21:00] <TimToady> also, part of the reason it probably must be syntactic is that the 10 in 1..10, 9, 8  wants to particpate differently in the range and in the intuition

[21:00] <patrickas> yes but the dilemma in your examples is should we return 1,2,3,4,5 OR 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5

[21:00] <TimToady> the latter

[21:01] <patrickas> In noen of the cases should Nil be returned

[21:01] <TimToady> directionality by the last items, not the first

[21:01] <patrickas> that's what I means it is anothe rissue

[21:01] <TimToady> I think I said that already

[21:02] <patrickas> thee isn't even a question if we should return Nil or something else .... we definetely want to return something else in all of your last examples, but there is an argument about that something else.

[21:03] <TimToady> Nil is just a limiting case of what I've already said

[21:03] <patrickas> Oh ok

[21:04] <TimToady> but I'd really prefer that intuited inequality not veto anything before the last 3 elements

[21:04] <TimToady> where that can be examined in the parser

[21:05] <TimToady> @values, 10, 9, 8 ... 5  has guaranteed semantics regardless of what's in @values

[21:05] <patrickas> ok but that means a whole lots of tests need to be changed

[21:05] <TimToady> it always makes @values, followed by 10,9,8 ... 5

[21:07] <patrickas> ok if no one else has a problem with that, I'll about implementing it that way.

[21:07] *** ruoso joined
[21:08] <patrickas> to me it just feels weird er that 1,2,3,4,5,6 ... $x

[21:15] <masak> maybe it'd even run, too. under alpha, at least.

[21:16] <moritz_> I think it did

[21:16] <tadzik> duh. I feel like fixing it after exams just to witness the awesomeness

[21:16] <masak> moritz_: oh, it definitely did, once.

[21:17] <masak> tadzik: that would be, for lack of a better word, awesome.

[21:17] <tadzik> masak: I need to pass my *$*&$! linear algebra first

[21:17] <Tene> tadzik: LolDispatch was just a short proof-of-concept.

[21:17] <masak> ooh! linear algebra! why didn't you *say* so? :D

[21:17] <tadzik> masak: hum?

[21:17] * masak likes it

[21:18] <tadzik> oh, you can help me then :)

[21:18] <masak> I certainly can.

[21:18] <Tene> tadzik: The traits aren't being done right and such.  It was just intended to explore how traits were implemented in rakudo at the time.

[21:18] <tadzik> I didn't have and problems today, but I will certainly have in the next few days. Got xmpp masak?

[21:18] <tadzik> Tene: I see

[21:18] <masak> tadzik: I have GChat.

[21:18] *** Ross left
[21:18] <masak> er, GTalk.

[21:19] <tadzik> masak: you mean this thing from Gmail? That's xmpp

[21:19] <masak> that's why I brought it up :)

[21:19] <tadzik> mind sharing?

[21:19] <masak> sounds like something a Vulcan would do... :P

[21:19] <Tene> tadzik: I don't recall why LolDispatch got committed.  It wasn't intended for wide public use.

[21:21] <Tene> If it does end up useful or inspiring work on something else, that's great.

[21:21] *** wamba left
[21:22] *** Ross joined
[21:23] <Tene> anyway, it should work fine if you fix the syntax for the trait definitions, and maybe other minor changes.  iirc, I was relying on intenrals that have changed significantly by now.

[21:24] <masak> but the intent of the module should still very much work.

[21:24] <masak> once all those changes are made, I mean.

[21:24] <Tene> That's right.

[21:24] <Tene> I did something like that with my POE-alike toy

[21:25] <Tene> http://github.com/tene/Doten/blob/master/dt.pl

[21:26] <Tene> still not done the right way there either, though

[21:27] <Tene> I also experimented with "is memoized" or "is cached" or something, but I couldn't manage to replace or wrap the sub from the trait handler.

[21:28] * moritz_ sent is mail, and now goes to bed

[21:29] * masak can haz it o/

[21:31] <masak> interesting question.

[21:31] <gfldex> I wonder what a guugu yimithirr would do aboard the ISS. North is flipping every 45 minutes.

[21:31] <gfldex> nice article :)

[21:32] <szbalint> Hm, so "run" returns the return code of a command that was executed. How do I get back the output the executed command wrote to STDOUT?

[21:32] <TimToady> no, north stays the same

[21:33] <TimToady> give or take a bit of inclination

[21:33] <TimToady> but I can testify that travel in a vehicle is a problem for geographic brains

[21:34] <TimToady> usually I just peg one end of the vehicle as notional north, and leave it there until I have to forcibly reorient on landing

[21:35] <TimToady> reorienting can be quite difficult when you're brain is hardwired to track the direction you think you're facing

[21:35] <TimToady> it's a bit like asking a synasthete to see different colors around letters and numbers than they're used to...

[21:36] <TimToady> I don't have much control of my brain circuitry on that level

[21:36] <diakopter> get a rootkit; they're free :P

[21:37] <TimToady> often I think I've reoriented, and my brain suddenly snaps back to the old orientation

[21:38] <gfldex> My head-north of my hometown is off by about 15' . Proly because I got my head before I got a map. :)

[21:39] <TimToady> and the sun angles really screwed me up in south america, because my brain thinks it knows where the ecliptic is

[21:39] <TimToady> I have to be very careful the first time I visit somewhere

[21:40] <TimToady> I spent the entire second half of my childhood with the sun rising in the north and setting in the south

[21:40] <TimToady> because I have Bremerton WA 90¬∞ off in my head

[21:41] <diakopter> TimToady: a spiral matrix one-liner will be difficult.

[21:41] <TimToady> my parents old house was 180¬∞ off on the inside, and there was nothing to be done about it

[21:42] <TimToady> not hard if you have an appropriate turtle

[21:42] *** Ross left
[21:42] <TimToady> it's just lay an egg, move forward || right

[21:43] <TimToady> assuming forward fails outside the matrix or where there's already an egg

[21:45] <masak> my room is 180¬∞ off on the inside. it's the half-twist of the stairs to the second floor that never registered somehow.

[21:45] <diakopter> egg already right ?? move forward !! turn right (don't need to worry about the edges, just go until eggs run out)

[21:45] <diakopter> er, turn left....

[21:45] <diakopter> heh

[21:49] <tadzik> rakudo: say 'alive'; #= testing

[21:50] <masak> hm. or not spec.

[21:50] <masak> :)

[21:51] <tadzik> duh

[21:51] <TimToady> looks like LTM failure to me

[21:51] <tadzik> . o O ( masak submits a rakudobug )

[21:51] <masak> I think it's just failure, period.

[21:51] <tadzik> . o O ( class masak does Druid)

[21:55] <szbalint> Is it possible to run an external program from Rakudo and capture it's output, without resorting to temporary files?

[21:55] <tadzik> qx//

[21:55] <tadzik> or qxx//, if you want interpolation

[21:56] <szbalint> ty :)

[21:57] <masak> qqx//

[21:57] <masak> (to parallel qq[])

[21:57] <tadzik> or right

[21:57] <tadzik> I miss backticks though :)

[21:58] <masak> tadzik: backticks now serve a higher purpose...

[21:58] <masak> ...nothing. :)

[21:59] <tadzik> (:

[21:59] <tadzik> oh, not really :)

[21:59] <tadzik> rakudo: say 'alive'; #`[ fasd ] say 'and well';

[21:59] <p6eval> rakudo d9aa57: OUTPUT¬´alive‚ê§and well‚ê§¬ª

[21:59] <tadzik> well, that's a backtick

[21:59] <masak> bleh.

[22:00] <tadzik> I liked this #=[] notatio better though

[22:00] <masak> I think the design decision behind that one was "intentionally uncommon".

[22:00] <tadzik> rakudo: #=[ fasd ] say 'test';

[22:00] <p6eval> rakudo d9aa57: OUTPUT¬´test‚ê§¬ª

[22:00] <masak> double bleh.

[22:00] <tadzik> hmm

[22:00] <tadzik> that's actually fun

[22:00] <tadzik> reads like: Comment equals fasd

[22:01] <masak> for a very long time, the response to delimited comments was: "there's line-ending comments, and there's Pod. deal with it."

[22:01] <masak> then @Larry succumbed, and the result was the ugly syntax we have today.

[22:02] <tadzik> is it that ugly really?

[22:02] <masak> oh, believe me.

[22:02] <tadzik> There is plenty of #=[] in Druid, and it looks not that bad for me

[22:02] <masak> :(

[22:03] <tadzik> hugme: hug masak

[22:03] * hugme hugs masak

[22:03] * masak feels better now

[22:03] <Tene> What's wrong with using =begin comment/=end comment ?

[22:03] <tadzik> verbosity

[22:03] <tadzik> imho

[22:04] <tadzik> hmmmm

[22:04] <tadzik> rakudo: say 'alive'; "test"; say 'and well';

[22:04] <p6eval> rakudo d9aa57: OUTPUT¬´alive‚ê§and well‚ê§¬ª

[22:05] <masak> we've had delimited comments all along, and we didn't know it. they're called "literal strings" :P

[22:05] <tadzik> I wonder if they're even ignored by Rakudo on this stage

[22:06] <tadzik> nope :)

[23:33] <masak> right; that.

[23:36] <lue> Of course, I wouldn't expect to learn perfect pronunciation any other way.

[23:37] <masak> it's pronounced as it sounds.

[23:37] <masak> Japanese is easy that way. :)

[23:38] <lue> I need to know how it sounds though! :)  .oO(If I just want to hear it, I should find the next time a Japanese game show comes on air)

[23:44] *** awwaiid joined
[23:47] <sorear> lue: japonic u, when it's pronounced at all, sounds exactly like english short u in e.g. rune

[23:48] <sorear> the trick is that Japanese orthography does not admit terminal consonants or paired consonants

[23:49] *** shade\ joined
[23:49] <TimToady> but has more variation than english, since in a five vowel system it isn't competing with, say "oo"

[23:49] <TimToady> as in "took"

[23:49] <TimToady> sometimes get a bit √º ish too

[23:50] <sorear> school would become suk≈´l; the first u is inserted just to avoid /sk/, which is unwritable

[23:50] <TimToady> since there's still a culture left over from samurai days of not moving your lips much while talking

[23:51] <sorear> erm, suk≈´ru

[23:51] <TimToady> from a standpoint of syllable length, it's not so much dropped there as turns into a double long ss

[23:51] <TimToady> sskul

[23:51] <TimToady> ss ku and ru are all basically the same length

[23:52] <TimToady> japanese is very syllable timed, like spanish but unlike english

[23:52] <TimToady> which is stress timed

[23:53] <sorear> as for r, the japanese only have one consonant between l and r

[23:53] <TimToady> and we have four, m, n, p, and q.  :D

[23:54] <sorear> this has the very useful consequence that the ear of a native Japanese /cannot hear/ the difference

[23:54] <sorear> if you say lu, or ru, or anything in between, they will hear HIRIGANA SYLLABLE LU

[23:54] <sorear> so... don't worry about it

[23:55] <sorear> (it cuts both ways.  the most painful part of Japanese I for me was learning to distinguish o from ≈ç)
