[02:39] <colomon> pmichaud: IMO we should make ng1 ng ASAP (tomorrow morning, maybe), and then schedule some time next week to make it master.

[02:40] <colomon> seems like that would avoid having a mostly broken master while giving us something to push for.

[02:43] <colomon> Hmmm... looks like passing @ parameters is broken in ng1?

[02:43] <colomon> > sub a(@b) { @b.perl.say; }; a(1...10);

[02:43] <colomon> Null PMC access in get_string()

[02:43] <colomon> > sub a(@b) { @b.perl.say; }; a(1,2,3);

[02:43] <colomon> Null PMC access in get_string()

[02:44] <ash_> > sub a(@a) { say 'hi'; }; a(1, 2);

[02:44] <ash_> Null PMC access in get_string()

[02:45] <ash_> its not even calling it, i think 

[02:46] <pugs_svn> r29612 | colomon++ | [t/spec] Fudge for ng1, plus fix typo. 

[02:46] <colomon> ash_: I'm pretty sure it's dying in the parameter binding, or something like that.

[03:20] <colomon> So, I've patched some tests and turned others off.  There are still 12 or so failing test files in the ng1 spectest.   (That's as compared to standard ng.)  I'm hoping that number can be zero 24 hours from now....

[08:07] <japhb> masak, you merge installed-modules, and I'll mine shiny new tuits.

[08:07] <japhb> np, welcome back

[08:08] <masak> as far as I recall, there was only one module collision left.

[08:08] <masak> something about URL.pm in both november and url.

[08:08] * masak checks

[08:09] <masak> ah. URI.pm in november and uri.

[08:10] <masak> well, I'll just rename the former to November::URI and add a comment about eventually moving over to the latter.

[10:13] * moritz_ is always happy when a new feature is implemented by a diff that has only inserts

[10:14] <moritz_> but it looks to me like I was careful enough previously so that the new feature is not very intrusive

[10:27] <moritz_> which reminds me, I wanted to add an interactive console to hugme

[10:28] <moritz_> providing the password to the POE::Component::IRC->spawn() method doesn't log it into the freenode account

[10:43] <moritz_> that's how I always figured that regexes engines must be

[10:44] <masak> code-generating? or brain-melting-but-then-simple?

[10:44] <moritz_> the latter

[10:45] <masak> yes. that's why I think the 7-wonders tutorial will be important.

[10:45] <masak> it's a way to unload the things I've learned in a graspable format.

[10:45] <jnthn> Does your brain re-solidify after the melting process is over?

[10:46] <masak> yes, but it's forever changed by the knowledge of code-generating regex engines.

[10:46] <masak> it remains to be seen whether that knowledge can be faithfully transferred to an unmelted mind.

[12:02] <colomon> jnthn: depends on ow you look at it

[12:03] <colomon> there were 20-something failing spectest files when I started

[12:03] <colomon> most seem to be only a couple of tests failing

[12:03] *** moritz_ sets mode: +o colomon

[12:04] <colomon> but they are kind of catastrophic failures.

[12:04] <colomon> things like my @a; not working

[12:04] <colomon> or @a[0] = 1 not working.

[12:05] <moritz_> is it really worth to fudge such things out?

[12:05] <moritz_> or would it be better to wait until somebody fixes it?

[12:06] <colomon> well, I've been working around the first with my @a = ()

[12:07] <colomon> but the problem is that spectest was just too noisy to be useful, which is a bad state of affairs

[12:09] <colomon> so I think it's worthwhile, even though I hope most of the fudges are undone this week.

[13:19] <colomon> o/

[13:20] <colomon> btw, does anyone know if p6 is spec'ed to have a function which takes a list and returns the first $n elements of it?

[13:21] <colomon> seems to me like that is highly desirable in a world of potentially infinite lazy lists...

[13:21] <masak> @list[^$n]

[13:23] <colomon> hmmm, makes sense.  and completely fails in ng1.  :)

[13:23] *** dr_df0 left
[13:24] <colomon> no array slices, I guess.

[13:25] <masak> at one point it was like that in master, as well :)

[13:25] *** lichtkind joined
[13:25] * colomon still kind of likes the idea of a .first-n method...

[13:26] <moritz_> colomon: like 'take' in Haskell?

[13:26] <colomon> moritz_: I don't remember (long time since I last messed around with Haskell), but probably.  

[13:27] <moritz_> multi sub infix:<take>(@LHS, Int $n) { @LHS[^$n] }

[15:39] <masak> I'm weekday-independent.

[15:40] <masak> and I prefer to deflate features by discovering flaws that are already there, not by contributing new ones.

[15:42] *** ignacio_ left
[15:58] <TimToady> we should rename getitems to a more user-friendly name if it will be used like Haskell's take

[15:59] <frettled> and the debugging function could be called "masak"

[15:59] *** rgrau left
[16:00] <frettled> TimToady: gettake?  ;)

[16:00] <jnthn> .gimme

[16:01] <TimToady> gimme ain't half bad

[16:01] <masak> C<temp> is defined (by S06) as a macro which replaces an existing thing temporarily within a given scope.

[16:01] <masak> I understand the mechanism by which the macro affects the statement with C<temp> in it. By which mechanism does the macro affect the end of the scope?

[16:02] <TimToady> usually by installing a LEVAE

[16:02] <TimToady> LEAVE even

[16:02] <masak> ah. cunning.

[16:02] <TimToady> let uses KEEP or UNDO

[16:02] <masak> that would even stack correctly.

[16:03] <pmichaud> ...and one of the reasons rakudo doesn't have 'temp' yet is because we don't have good leave semantics in parrot

[16:03] *** nihiliad joined
[16:03] <TimToady> being able to fire off actions after a longjmp is one of the most important features of Perl 5, internally

[16:05] *** alester joined
[16:07] <TimToady> I'm quite willing to put off generalized temp till after 6.0 though, as long as we have dynamic vars (including the special 'temp $*foo' form)

[16:07] <TimToady> (which doesn't need a LEAVE)

[16:08] <PerlJam> frettled: "gettake" makes me think it should be pronounced like "bukake" for some reason.

[16:10] <masak> sounds reasonable to me.

[16:10] <masak> doesn't 'bukkake' have a double 'k', by the way? not that I would know.

[16:12] *** meppl joined
[16:12] <hudnix> transliteration of japanese words to Roman characters is rigorous.

[16:12] <hudnix> er, *not* rigorous.

[16:12] <PerlJam> masak: Im pour at speling.

[16:13] <hudnix> Like perl, tmtowtdi

[16:13] <masak> :)

[16:14] <TimToady> now I'm trying to figure out why you'd want to hang a Buddha  :)

[16:14] <TimToady> or borrow a hit

[16:14] <frettled> heh

[16:14] <frettled> But yes, the normal transliteration is «bukkake».

[16:15] <PerlJam> indeed, the doubled "tt" may have even been the trigger that made me think of bukkake to begin with.

[16:15] <TimToady> or maybe pull a punch

[16:15] <pmichaud> (yes, we have dynamic vars in rakudo.  I'm still working on the special 'temp $*foo' form)

[16:16] <TimToady> it's just 'my $*foo = CALLER:<$*foo>' really

[16:16] <jnthn> Oh great, I think I'll glance here for light debugging relief and the subject is bukkake...

[16:16] <TimToady> it's possible we shouldn't really reuse 'temp' for that

[16:16] <masak> TimToady: is 'to hang a Buddha' a euphemism in Japan? :)

[16:16] <jnthn> TimToady: temp kinda made logical sense to me there, but it does feel a tiny bit odd.

[16:17] <frettled> Wikipedia is exceptionally helpful regarding «bukkake», but perhaps NSFW and NSFK.

[16:17] <TimToady> the primary damage is that it seems to prevent temporizing some caller's dynamic var

[16:17] <TimToady> maybe that's a feature :)

[16:18] <frettled> "Daddy, daddy," said the little girl, "can you explain why ..."

[16:18] <frettled> and you'd better hope that daddy's being asked to explain features of Perl 6 :)

[16:20] <TimToady> okay, it's related to 'hit' and 'hang', but with metaphorical overloaded meanings

[16:21] <masak> seems so.

[16:21] <pmichaud> "Ours not to explain why.  Ours but to 'say' and 'die'"

[16:21] <TimToady> no wonder it wasn't in my Japanese dictionary  :)

[16:22] *** tuxdna left
[16:23] <TimToady> so, um, PerlJam, how are you acquainted with that word?  Or were you thinking of some other word?  (TimToady gives PerlJam a way to save face.)

[16:23] *** tuxdna joined
[16:25] <pmichaud> (PerlJam:  When already in a hole, sometimes it's best to stop digging :-)

[16:25] <japhb> "Save face" takes a whole new meaning in that context"

[16:25] <japhb> pmichaud, what, before you hit magma?

[16:26] <TimToady> (PerlJam: here's your cue to say you meant 'bukkaku', yeah, that's the ticket)

[16:26] <japhb> masak, if I read the backlog properly, it sounds like installed_modules has been merged, but proto won't run on ng yet?

[16:26] *** iblechbot left
[16:27] <pmichaud> it wouldn't surprise me if proto doesn't run on ng yet.  ng is missing some features

[16:27] <masak> japhb: correct. haven't tried to run proto under ng, but cf. snowballs in warm places.

[16:27] <japhb> roger that.

[16:28] <pmichaud> okay, so yesterday I postulated that perhaps we should simply bite-the-bullet and make ng1 into the new master tomorrow morning.  Any thoughts yay/nay ?

[16:28] <japhb> I've been away a while ... what is the difference between ng and ng1?

[16:28] <PerlJam> pmichaud: +1

[16:29] <masak> pmichaud: it's your call.

[16:29] <pmichaud> ng1 is the branch of ng where we've prototyped iterators and lazy lists (and seems to be the direction we'll go)

[16:29] <pmichaud> one important thing to note is that I'm not likely to be around much Thu-Mon  (I'll be online some, but at odd hours)

[16:30] *** meppl left
[16:30] <masak> now that proto's installed-modules is merged, I thought I'd focus a bit on ecosystem-wide testing. I think that'll wash out tons of regressions not caught by the test suite.

[16:31] <japhb> Has master been touched at all since the release?

[16:31] <masak> but I don't want ng progress or merge status to stall on that.

[16:31] <pmichaud> japhb: not significantly, no

[16:31] *** k23z__ joined
[16:31] <PerlJam> TimToady: btw, I don't see a need for face-saving.  I'm familiar with that word like many other bizarre things because I hang out on IRC  :)

[16:32] * masak .oO( wonder if Buddha hangs out on IRC )

[16:32] <pmichaud> I believe the Buddha nature is everywhere :-)

[16:32] <masak> Mu.

[16:33] <PerlJam> masak++

[16:33] <hudnix> ugh

[16:33] <japhb> pmichaud, then I'd say might as well bring ng1 to the forefront sooner rather than later, to maximize time with everyone working on it, and just put something in the readme about using the January release if they can't spend tuits working with ng problems yet.

[16:33] *** bluescreen joined
[16:33] <pmichaud> japhb: vote noted, thanks!

[16:34] <pmichaud> japhb: I'm in some agreement there (which is why I proposed this) -- I think we should just commit to the new version even though it's a significant regression, and hopefully that can spur us on a bit more

[16:34] *** clen left
[16:34] <pmichaud> and also remove any questions about where our focus lies :)

[16:34] * japhb idly wonders if any of his Perl 6 code has a chance of running after the changeover.  :-)

[16:34] <japhb> exactly.

[16:36] <PerlJam> pmichaud: yep. Rakudo has been pregnant with ng since Oct and people have been itching for it to give birth given that Rakudo Star looms on the horizon

[16:36] <pmichaud> okay, so should I do it tomorrow or Tue of next week?

[16:36] <pmichaud> or delegate to someone else?  ;-)

[16:36] <PerlJam> sooner rather than later IMHO

[16:37] <pmichaud> okay, plan is to switch tomorrow.  note objections in the backlog :)

[16:37] <pmichaud> (I'll check the logs before committing)

[16:38] <masak> just to be clear here: as soon as ng1 is called master, I can report whatever I want to RT, right? :)

[16:38] <pmichaud> masak: right

[16:38] <masak> \o/

[16:38] <pmichaud> masak: consider it a birthday present or something :)

[16:38] <masak> this is the bestest... ever! *sniff*

[16:38] <pmichaud> although we know there will be a lot of bugs.  I might recommend holding off on an rt onslaught until mid next week :)

[16:38] <mberends> .oO( remember to upgrade RT's storage capacity )

[16:39] <pmichaud> it'd be like shooting fish in a barrel :-)

[16:39] <pmichaud> actually, more like shooting fish in a barrel filled with nothing but fish

[16:39] <colomon> japhb: the answer is almost certainly no.

[16:39] * masak locks and loads

[16:39] <colomon> japhb: I'd be surprised if any randomly chosen Perl 6 code of over ten lines works in ng1.

[16:40] <pmichaud> so, I'd say after Tue of next week, rt bug reporting is fair game :-)

[16:40] <pmichaud> on the other hand, we may also be able to eliminate some active bugs in rt :)

[16:40] *** cognominal left
[16:40] *** nacho joined
[16:40] *** payload left
[16:40] *** ejs left
[16:41] <PerlJam> wait ... so what happens Tue of next week?

[16:41] <masak> very well. I'll hold off a week.

[16:41] <japhb> colomon: noted.  Especially since I tend to write fringe code in the first place.  :-)

[16:41] *** cotto_w0rk joined
[16:41] <masak> the goal, obviously, is to minimize the failures in the cheese by Feb release.

[16:42] <colomon> japhb: I mean, unless pmichaud's hacked since I last checked, simple things like my @a; and @b[0] = 1 don't work right now.

[16:42] <masak> either by fixing rakudo or by workarounds in the cheese.

[16:42] <colomon> masak: the goal is that Feb is full of awesome.

[16:42] <pmichaud> Tue of next week is when I get back from my absence this weekend :)

[16:42] <pmichaud> and can more actively work on removing bugs

[16:42] <masak> colomon: that sounds like the lyrics of a song. :)

[16:43] *** bluescreen left
[16:43] <PerlJam> pmichaud: but how will you know which bugs exist withoug a nice fat RT queue for you to tick off?  ;)

[16:43] <pmichaud> PerlJam: ummm,  "make spectest"  ?

[16:44] <pmichaud> "my @a;"  doesn't work?

[16:44] *** cotto_working left
[16:44] *** dr_df0 left
[16:44] * PerlJam is just being goofy

[16:44] <jnthn> ng: my @a;

[16:45] <p6eval> ng 58d896:  ( no output )

[16:45] <PerlJam> Besides, jnthn will be working, yes?

[16:45] <colomon> pmichaud: well, it doesn't complain when you do it, but you can't do anything with @a afterward.

[16:45] <pmichaud> colomon: okay, I'll fix that.

[16:45] *** bluescreen joined
[16:45] <masak> ng: my @a; say @a.perl

[16:45] <pmichaud> anyway, depending on other events around here between today and tomorrow, I should be able to get lists and arrays working

[16:45] <p6eval> ng 58d896: OUTPUT«[]␤»

[16:45] <colomon> at least, there were a zillion tests like my @a; @a.push(1); which failed.

[16:45] <jnthn> PerlJam: I'll have a decent bit of Rakudo time from a day or two's time, and over the weekend. :-)

[16:45] <colomon> > my @a; say @a.perl

[16:45] <colomon> Null PMC access in elements()

[16:46] <colomon> (that's what I get in ng1)

[16:46] <pmichaud> if someone wanted to tackel   s/IterDone/EMPTY/g   that'd be useful

[16:46] <pmichaud> *tackle

[16:46] <colomon> is there more to it than just search and replace?

[16:46] * PerlJam can't help but mentally insert a "G" before IterDone every time

[16:46] <pmichaud> also, change RangeIterator to RangeIter and SeqIterator to SeqIter

[16:46] <pmichaud> of course, when a SeqIter is finished it becomes a non-seqiter  :-)

[17:07] *** hicx174 left
[17:08] <TimToady> except it would be odd to use getslice for a positional parameter

[17:09] *** hicx174 joined
[17:10] <TimToady> getparcel is also strange if the next thing isn't a parcel, but I suppose anything can be considered a degenerate parcel

[17:10] <TimToady> getitem unfortunately sounds like you're getting one item from the next parcel, which is wrong

[17:14] <masak> 'aight.

[17:14] <colomon> wouldn't it be easier to just tell me, anyway?

[17:19] <colomon> ah, so you haven't run the spectests yet?

[17:19] <colomon> woah, make test just blew up.

[17:20] <colomon> I'm doing a make clean; make now.

[17:24] <colomon> )

[17:24] <masak> and that worked before?

[17:24] <colomon> yes.

[17:25] <masak> shall I revert them?

[17:25] <colomon> let's try reverting them just on our own machines and see what happens.

[17:25] <masak> nod.

[17:27] *** rdice left

[17:29] <masak> oh wait. belay that. :/

[17:29] <masak> I was still on master.

[17:30] <colomon> It's the EMPTY patch.  I reverted it (and tweaked Makefile.in to use IterDone again) and things seem to work.

[17:30] <colomon> make test passes.

[17:30] <masak> ok.

[17:30] <masak> feel free to push the revert commit.

[19:58] <colomon> pmichaud: did you have a scheme in mind for handling the use of the old standard List methods on iterators?  things like .elems?

[20:00] *** Chillance joined
[20:00] <pmichaud> I'm not sure if Iterators does Positional or not.  If so, then the Iterator probably needs to convert to a Seq and do that.

[20:00] <pmichaud> Under that interpretation, .elems should also be processed on a Seq, I guess.

[20:01] <pmichaud> Either that or .elems could be directly on the Iterator, simply doing .get(item) repeatedly. 

[20:01] <pmichaud> For now I'd put .elems directly on the Iterator -- we can update later.

[20:01] <colomon> okay, I'll go ahead with that...

[20:26] <TimToady> Iterator doesn't do Positional, but method requiring a Positional object can probably do Cool-like autocoercions to Seq

[20:27] <colomon> pmichaud: I've pushed Iterator.elems.  Should I do the same thing to create an Iterator.Str?

[20:27] <colomon> TimToady: oooo.

[20:27] <pmichaud> well, for .elems I'd prefer to "optimize" it a bit and not keep track of the reified elements.

[20:28] <TimToady> what does say $it.elems; say $it.get; do?

[20:28] <pmichaud> I would presume the number of items left in the iterator, followed by a thrown exception

[20:28] <TimToady> that is, does .elems throw away the values?

[20:29] <colomon> TimToady: it has to, doesn't it?

[20:29] <pmichaud> it doesn't have to, it could convert the iterator into a Seq

[20:29] <TimToady> that's not so good

[20:29] *** cdarroch left
[20:29] <TimToady> Iterators should just iterate, and let the type system coerce, I expect

[20:29] <colomon> pmichaud: Even if it converts the iterator into a Seq, the iterator is going to be consumed, isn't it?

[20:29] <TimToady> a la Cool

[20:29] <pmichaud> that's kinda weird, though

[20:30] <pmichaud> I mean:    @foo.map({...}).elems

[20:30] *** blahblah left
[20:30] <TimToady> well, if you throw away a Seq, it gets GC'd

[20:30] <pmichaud> right, but if the .map produces a 1-million element Seq...

[20:31] <TimToady> I guess that argues that the user wants to throw them away

[20:31] <pmichaud> I'm somewhat going on the "iterators tend to be invisible" principal here

[20:31] <pmichaud> and that if you somehow got a hold of a visible iterator, you know what you're doing with it

[20:31] <pmichaud> I'm fine if we auto-coerce iterators to Seq in all instances... it just seems sub-optimal in some common cases

[20:31] <TimToady> so maybe it's okay if .elems consumes presuming we don't have another alias around

[20:33] <pmichaud> that's why I started with the idea that perhaps .elems is okay on Iterator directly, but other Positional type things make it into a Seq

[20:33] <TimToady> well, upgrading to Seq isn't gonna help my example anyway

[20:33] <pmichaud> right

[20:33] <TimToady> unless we do it in-place, which is antisocial

[20:33] <colomon> oh, good, I'm glad that wasn't just me being dense.

[20:34] <TimToady> it was all of us :)

[20:34] <pmichaud> do parcels still tend to upgrade to Seq ?

[20:34] <pmichaud> or just not in-place ?

[20:34] <pmichaud> (in older rakudo, parcels tended to become Seq in-place)

[20:34] <TimToady> well, my brand-new spec probably contradicts itself on that

[20:34] <pmichaud> okay

[20:35] *** plainhao left
[20:35] <pmichaud> in general I'm heavily biased against any sort of in-place operations until it's clear that it's the only way to do something :)

[20:35] <TimToady> currently I think explicit .slice does, but not binding via .getobj

[20:35] <pmichaud> oh, I would think that .slice would return a new Parcel :-)

[20:35] <TimToady> but maybe it does there

[20:35] <TimToady> I mean, what .slice returns instead of internal parcels

[20:36] <TimToady> *attack

[20:37] <pmichaud> colomon: anyway, .elems on Iterator is fine for now.  I'd go ahead and have .Str pass through Seq for the time being

[20:37] <pmichaud> eh, or maybe that should be the other way around...  Seq's Str passes through Iterator.Str ?  ;-)

[20:41] <TimToady> and item assignment certainly upgrades to Seq

[20:41] <ruoso> and so are feeds

[20:43] <diakopter> simplify |= maxvalue

[20:43] <TimToady> it's a good bet that the spots where nobody has tried to implement them yet might be indicative of spots where simplification is warranted

[20:44] <ruoso> TimToady, I'm not sure it's something spec-wise... but I've been thinking of iterators in the same sense of unix pipes...

[20:44] <ruoso> in a sense that each end of the iterator will run a different implicit thread

[20:44] <TimToady> certainly I think of feeds that way

[20:44] <ruoso> only feeds?

[20:44] <TimToady> to the point of possibly requiring braces around

[20:45] <TimToady> just to keep things honest lexically

[20:45] <ruoso> so...

[20:45] <ruoso> map { ... }, grep { ... }, map { ... }, @stream

[20:45] <ruoso> won't paralellize unless feeds are used

[20:46] <TimToady> they can if there's no side effects, but ==> promises good behavior there to a greater extent, I suspect

[20:46] <ruoso> right... so, conceptually, regular map and grep can only paralellize as an optimization... 

[20:47] <ruoso> while feed operators do paralellize by default

[20:47] <TimToady> anyway, as we develop feeds, we'll have to think very carefully about how to limit variables being shared accidentally
