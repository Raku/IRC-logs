[00:10] <lichtkind> mberends: you want to do first?

[00:13] <mberends> I would suggest generally each subheading remains as the only word, and the text below each heading becomes a subpage. But there may be exceptions..

[00:14] <mberends> Development Status, Downloads, Online Documentation can all do that

[00:15] <mberends> Products and Services should maybe just disappear

[00:16] <mberends> Other Information, oops, a new spam there. No good to us, we're not teens ;)

[00:16] <lichtkind> mberends: im not that radical but i would first put some meat into the implementations page

[00:18] <lichtkind> mberends: and maybe create about perl 6 page from where goes all the general term infos as links

[00:18] <mberends> lichtkind: ok you do that, I'll get started on implementations

[00:19] <lichtkind> mberends: allright so you write the implementations page and i clean the front page?

[00:43] <jnthn> mberends: One other reason to stick with NQP for now is that it also is able to generate more efficient code than Rakudo presently can, due to being able to make a bunch of assumptions that (at least without an optimizer) Rakudo can't.

[00:43] <mberends> lichtkind: your implementations edit is ok here

[00:44] <diakopter> the empty method on [] is the same as 'shift'?

[00:45] <Tene> how does that make sense?

[00:46] *** eternaleye joined

[02:20] <lue> why they can't un-unify the Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters and put them in that extra space, who knows?

[02:21] <arlinius> I do tend to agree that ranges should work for all of Unicode. On the other hand, maybe the Range class also needs a 'universe' attribute for working with smaller ranges. Define your universe to 'A'..'Z' and you get 'Z'.succ => 'AA'.

[02:22] *** mberends left

[02:23] <arlinius> not that there aren't plenty of still-undefined reserved (non private use) ranges

[02:23] <colomon>  TimToady: oooo, good point on the pir:: in the trig tests.  It's basically a workaround for a really annoying Rakudo bug, as soon as the bug is gone it can go away.  If we just take it out now, it will cause a significant performance hit on the spectests.

[02:32] <lue> yeah, right now it seems to be a problem with the RANGES constant (I'm tempted to rewrite the whole thing)

[02:32] <colomon> I'm pretty sure that's what after is supposed to do.

[02:32] <lue> (by whole thing, I mean the constant. It's big)

[02:33] <colomon> But something more clearly needs to be done for iterating over strings.

[02:33] <colomon> is it just factoring in length?

[02:33] <arlinius> colomon: so 'AA' isn't supposed to be after 'Z'? or is 'AA' not supposed to be 'Z'.succ?

[02:35] <TimToady> Str.succ is not intended to produce values in lexicographic order, which is relatively useless in real life.  So we steal .succ (and ++) for "counting with carry" in customary ranges

[02:38] <lue> so the after infix deals in unicode, while succ doesn't? Weird...

[02:38] <p6eval> rakudo 3b869c:  ( no output )

[02:38] <snarkyboojum> because 'AA' cmp 'Z' doesn't equal 1

[02:38] <TimToady> 'a'..'Â£' looks completely useless to me

[02:39] <TimToady> but see S03:431 and following

[02:39] <TimToady> actually, that section implies that .succ is not used for ++ on strings, hmm...

[02:39] <lue> it's just an example. I typed Â£ last night on accident, been using it for the example ever since :)

[02:39] <snarkyboojum> but I wouldn't expect Rakudo to keep building an infinitely long string (in the limit)

[02:39] <TimToady> that's specced, though

[02:40] <snarkyboojum> cool :)

[02:40] <snarkyboojum> I'm a complete newbie

[02:40] <TimToady> see S03:2029

[02:40] <lue> how's about japanese kana? Seems like that would fail, considering it's not part of RANGES.

[02:41] <TimToady> we let A'..'Â£' produce an infinite list on the basis that it's also lazy

[02:41] <arlinius> almost any alphabet in Unicode, really

[02:42] <lue> seems terribly arrogant to me to only allow english, greek, and a few (seemingly random) number sets.

[02:42] <TimToady> why would you want to in increment kana?

[02:42] <TimToady> it's not like the codepoints follow the a,i,u,e,o song...  :)

[02:43] <snarkyboojum> cool - so it's not a bug :) sweet

[02:43] <lue> If you were writing japanese software. Same reason english people'd want to increment the English alphabet.

[02:43] <snarkyboojum> alpha: say 'A'..'Â£'

[02:43] <p6eval> alpha 30e0ed: OUTPUTÂ«ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZâ¤Â»

[02:43] <TimToady> you can still use it as a Range, as in testing cmp its endpoints

[02:43] <snarkyboojum> so the behaviour has changed

[02:43] <lue> (hey, unicode better fix that, TimToady.)

[02:43] <TimToady> but cmp has nothing to do with .succ, really

[02:43] * TimToady sings the a,i,u,e,o song to himself...

[02:44] <snarkyboojum> it's just that the RangeIterator uses .succ and then does a check with 'after' (which uses cmp)

[02:44] * lue Our Salute to Confusing Programming

[02:44] <TimToady> yes, and then if you do something non-sensical, you get a lot of nonsense :)

[02:45] <snarkyboojum> but this is a bug

[02:45] <snarkyboojum> because Z.succ is not 'after' Z

[02:45] <snarkyboojum> anyway - I'm sure this is all very obvious to everyone apart from me :)

[02:45] <TimToady> the test is supposed to be !after, which matches eqv

[02:45] <japhb> Rakudo team: belated congratulations on the ng release!

[02:46] <TimToady> or the other way around

[02:46] <arlinius> should 'AA' be after 'Z'?

[02:46] <TimToady> anyway, a direct hit is suppose to stop it

[02:46] <TimToady> if you increment Z, yes

[02:49] <eternaleye> Maybe better would be just setting a 'no more' variable on $curr ~~ $endpoint, rather than using after?

[02:50] <eternaleye> And then returning the EMPTY failure

[03:37] <lue> Can anybody give me various 'terms' related to Perl6? Such as Rakudo, Parrot, -Ofun, etc.

[03:39] <colomon> rakudo: say 1 <=> 2

[03:39] <p6eval> rakudo 3b869c: OUTPUTÂ«-1â¤Â»

[03:40] <pmichaud> Rakudo:  An implementation of Perl 6.

[03:40] <pmichaud> Parrot:  The virtual machine underlying Rakudo Perl 6.  Parrot is also intended to support other dynamic languages.

[03:40] <pmichaud> -Ofun:  "optimize(d) for fun" -- how we decide what to work on.

[03:41] <pmichaud> other terms from the rakudo side include NQP, PCT, PAST, PIR, PMC

[03:41] <pmichaud> we also have STD and STD.pm

[03:42] <colomon> pmichaud: did you have any thoughts on how to properly fix the "our @a;" in classes bug?  TimToady rightfully pointed out that putting the pir-version of it in the trig tests to optimize them isn't really kosher...

[03:42] <lue> Great! I needed some of them for the P6 novelty calendar system.

[03:42] <TimToady> LTA

[03:43] <pmichaud> Pugs

[03:47] <TimToady> phasers

[03:47] <lue> I'm using P6 terms for month names, and various significant people on IRC for days of the week.

[03:47] <pmichaud> phasers!  how can I forget that?!?

[03:47] <lue> phasers in P6...?

[03:47] <pmichaud> yes, phasers.

[03:48] <colomon> they help deal with the daleks.

[03:48] <TimTom> rakudo: say [+] (5,4,3)

[03:48] <pmichaud> see S04 for details, but a "phaser" is one of those elements that manage transitions between different phases of execution.

[03:48] <TimTom> So are the [] meta operators not implemented or did the syntax change?

[03:48] <pmichaud> rakudo (new branch) doesn't have [] yet.

[03:48] <colomon> TimTom: NYI

[03:49] <pmichaud> I hope to have [] working again in a week or so

[03:49] <TimToady> feeds

[03:49] <TimTom> Yea, I knew alpha had them because I was running a program that used to work and trying to figure out the errors

[03:49] <TimTom> When it was in a method it was complaining about it being unable to find the end } in blockoid :)

[03:50] <TimToady> sigspace, ratchet

[03:51] <TimToady> captures, parcels

[03:51] <TimToady> roles

[03:51] <TimToady> junctions

[03:52] <TimTom> It also looks like @_ is read only right now? I had to create and name my own temporary variable because it gave me "Placeholder variable cannot override existing signature at ..."

[03:53] <TimTom> Ah.  I think that was because it was the second term in an assignment expansion.  If I assign directly to it, it reports it's read only

[03:54] <TimToady> shortnames/longnames

[03:56] <TimToady> Christmas

[04:23] <TimTom> Yea.  I figured that's why most people were coming to the defense of master, it's real hard to disambiguate the single [ from the double [[ when there's all the other symbols around it

[04:32] <colomon> unless someone beats me to it overnight.  :)

[04:33] <colomon> BTW, I ended up fixing RangeIter by using a new comparison function which does cmp unless you've got a Str, and handles Str specially.  

[04:33] <colomon> That will actually be needed in Range itself and series too, I guess.  Seems like it might almost be worth adding it to the Spec.

[04:34] <colomon> though heaven help us, preferably with a nicer name than RangeIterCmp.

[04:36] *** TimTom left
[04:38] <lue> hey look, someone else who uses Konversation here (besides me)

[04:42] <eternaleye> Perhaps S03:2003 was supposed to be 1, 2 ...\n10, 20 ...\n 100, 200 ... 900; gessing from the comment preceding it about it being arithmetic

[04:42] <eternaleye> *guessing

[04:47] *** plainhao left
[04:47] *** mssm left
[04:48] <TimToady> but that won't work, since it uses 3 values

[04:49] <pugs_svn> r29786 | lwall++ | [S03] delete bogus dup code spotted by eternaleye++ 

[04:49] <TimToady> that is, 90, 100, 200 is going to confuse it

[04:50] <TimToady> or maybe not, depend on whether the 2nd ... can actually see the earlier values

[04:50] <TimToady> which in turn depends on whether it's right or left associative

[04:51] <TimToady> and ... is defined as list associative, which doesn't help us :)

[04:52] <TimToady> but it does mean we could probably force it to work with just 2 nums between the ...s

[04:53] <TimToady> and you could force it the other way with parens

[04:55] <TimToady> (1,2...9), 10, 20 ... 90  # second ... sees all lefthand numbers inluding 9

[04:57] <TimToady> otoh, 9,10,20 is probably going to die if it can't intuit a function

[05:02] <bkeeler> Nah, you just need a sufficiently advanced algorithm.  Before long it will have the ability to solve those 'next number in the series' questions they have on IQ tests.

[05:02] <pugs_svn> r29787 | lwall++ | [S03] upon further reflection, we can make eternaleye++'s conjecture work right. 

[05:03] <TimToady> I always like thos...

[05:03] *** pnate left
[05:04] <bkeeler> Now if you can have it guess the winning powerball numbers...

[05:04] <TimToady> funny when a typo turns out self-referential

[05:04] <eternaleye> I assumed it was right associative

[05:04] <bkeeler> hehe

[05:04] <eternaleye> Since that gives the user the most flexibility

[05:05] <TimToady> in the table, X operators are only right associative if the operator changes

[05:05] <TimToady> otherwise it's like zip

[05:05] <eternaleye> Ah

[05:05] <TimToady> dotdotdot(1,2; 10,20; 100,200; 900)

[05:06] <TimToady> and the function can evaluate the lists however it sees fit

[05:06] <TimToady> each of the sublists is independently lazy

[05:07] <TimToady> which is good, since we can't evaluate a list on the left till we've evaluated at least one value of the next list to the right

[05:07] <TimToady> and, of course, zip itself does them all in parallel

[05:07] <eternaleye> Which is why I assumed right assoc without thinking about it further

[05:09] <TimToady> I'm almost getting to like this language

[12:04] <k23z__> it's called rubik

[12:04] <k23z__> it lives in a closed subversion at the moment

[12:04] <k23z__> but it will get out when it's bigger

[12:05] <masak> k23z__: you should think about changing your nick. my Bayesian reasoning engine tells me that IRC users with a nick like yours won't be long-lived here on #perl6.

[12:05] <masak> k23z__: no offense. it just looks like a throwaway nick. :)

[12:05] <k23z__> it is

[12:06] <masak> k23z__: to blend in, you should name yourself 'continuation' or 'syntax' or something.

[12:06] <masak> or 'dog6'.

[12:06] <k23z__> masak: I see, and your nickname will soon be part of the keywords of Perl6 no ?

[12:07] <masak> apparently I also take a moritz... o.O

[12:09] <masak> no wait, that's two terms in a row!

[12:09] <masak> you need a comma after the first block. or a semicolon, if they're two different statements.

[12:11] <colomon> I think "masak" should be some sort of exception handler that detects Null PMCs and e-mails them to RT.

[12:11] <k23z__> yeah

[12:40] <k23z__> is p6 still self-hosting or that went away with pugs ?

[12:40] <masak> being self-hosting is still a long-term goal of Perl 6 and its implementations.

[12:40] <masak> Pugs was actually written in Haskell, not Perl 6.

[12:41] <masak> so far with Rakudo, the grammar parts are written in nqp-rx, a self-hosting subset of Perl 6. much of the CORE namespace subs and classes are written in Perl 6.

[13:14] <masak> oh right.

[13:16] <masak> k23z__: no degree here. just generally annoying.

[13:16] <jnthn> k23z__: Though my degree let you pick and choose courses in the last year, and by then I'd got interested in compilers/VMs/programming langauges so picked a few related to that.

[13:16] <masak> I'm at uni, though. about to get a bioinformatics degree.

[13:17] <jnthn> Compilers aren't that crazy. They're just programs that take some input (source code) and spit out some lower level thing. :-)

[13:39] <masak> and I plan to spend some time today finishing up GGE.

[13:39] <jnthn> I've got one extra talk at nlpw that I need to procrastinate.

[13:39] <masak> cool.

[13:39] <jnthn> Finishing GGE? :-)

[13:40] <masak> yes, GGE is almost PGE-compliant now.

[13:40] <jnthn> Wow!

[13:40] <masak> it lacks lookarounds and goals, but otherwise it's as powerful.

[13:40] <masak> I've learned loads in the past few months.

[13:40] <masak> I also have a blog post series in 7 parts coming up about PGE internals.

[13:40] <jnthn> Wow.

[13:41] * jnthn looks forward to that.

[13:43] <jnthn> heh, you can't change duration in act

[13:44] <jnthn> Ah, I'll take "sane meta-model talk in 15 mins" as an interesting challenge. :-)

[13:48] <masak> jnthn: I think one can sometimes submit one's talk with a given duration. but I remember that this wasn't possible with the hack2010dk instance.

[14:16] <diakopter> I remember that, now

[14:31] <colomon> there you go.

[14:31] <jnthn> Right.

[14:31] <jnthn> I think we're getting the static chain for methods wrong.

[14:32] <jnthn> (they're attaching to the wrong lexical scopes)

[14:32] <jnthn> I'm not immediately sure of the best fix.

[14:41] <pmichaud> (good morning, #perl6)

[14:41] <colomon> o/

[14:44] <jnthn> pmichaud: We have a class setup block, which makes the meta-method calls, and then the class body

[14:44] <jnthn> pmichaud: What we're emitting:

[14:44] *** pmurias joined
[14:45] *** IllvilJa left
[14:45] <jnthn> BEGIN { ...ClassHOW.new... $obj.^add_method('foo', method { ... }) ... }; { ...class body... }

[14:45] <jnthn> What we want:

[14:45] <jnthn> BEGIN { ...ClassHOW.new... $obj.^add_method('foo', <reference to the meth>) ... }; { method foo() { ... }; ...class body... }

[14:46] <jnthn> pmichaud: The ref should be by sub ID I guess. I'm not sure how that's meant to look.

[14:51] <pmichaud> in

[14:51] <pmichaud> 14:44 <jnthn> BEGIN { ...ClassHOW.new... $obj.^add_method('foo', method { ... }) ... }; { ...class body... }

[14:51] <pmichaud> is there any cloning taking place to the method { ... }  portion?  (There's not really a difference to <reference to the meth>)

[14:53] <jnthn> pmichaud: For a class, no.

[14:53] <jnthn> For a role, I think the metarole clones it.

[14:53] <pmichaud> okay.  I'll look at it closely in just a bit.

[14:54] <jnthn> Well, I think the problem is that in the PAST tree, the PAST::Block for the method is not within the PAST::Block that is the class body.

[14:54] <jnthn> So it's :outer points to the wrong place.

[14:59] <pmurias> k23z__: re how do we know that the compiler works correctly, Perl 6 has a test suit (it lives in t/spec in the pugs repository)

[14:59] *** IllvilJa joined
[14:59] *** explorer__ left
[14:59] <pmichaud> jnthn: yes, that would be the problem.

[14:59] <pmichaud> that's fixable.

[15:00] <colomon> \o/

[15:00] <pmichaud> we can either do a reference to the PAST::Block (in the class body) -- this is exactly what you said above (now that I understand it)

[15:01] <k23z__> yes but tests are not sufficient as Haskell people say , they told me this because I told them I was writing tests in Perl5

[15:01] <pmichaud> or perhaps we need an :outer attribute on PAST::Block where one can explicitly set the outer

[15:01] <k23z__> I don't know what they mean by "prove" , they say it has something to do with type theory

[15:02] <jnthn> pmichaud: ooh...:outer setting would be The Cool.

[15:02] <jnthn> I don't dislike that.

[15:02] <pmichaud> yes, I just need an hour or so to decide if it's a good idea or design smell :)

[15:02] <pmichaud> anyway, now that you've described the problem, I can fix it

[15:03] <jnthn> k23z__: There's a school of thought that says that the only way to be sure is to use mathematics to make formal proofs about how the language will behave in every case.

[15:04] <jnthn> That approach doesn't tend to lead to programming languages thare are of huge amounts of interest to people writing real software though.

[15:04] <pmichaud> jnthn says it correctly

[15:04] <jnthn> There's something of a disconnect between the academic programming langauge scene and the languages that are being used to write most of the world's software. Which is in a way kinda sad.

[15:05] <k23z__> and how is Perl6 not an academic project ?

[15:05] <pmichaud> k23z__: depends on what you mean by "academic project"  :)

[15:06] <jnthn> ooh...time to go for my train to Vienna!

[15:06] <pmichaud> jnthn: have fun!

[20:58] <masak> oh, that. but the site is still running. good.

[20:59] <lichtkind> masak: yes an wiki you cant edit :)

[20:59] <masak> that bad? I thought it was only sometimes.

[20:59] <lichtkind> masak: no anytime since weeks, or i wouldnt have switched now to tpf wiki for now :)

[21:00] <masak> lichtkind: sorry about that. I wasn't aware it was that bad.

[21:00] <lue> any suggestions on how to get Temporal up and running properly?

[21:00] <lichtkind> masak: that was the reason for asskickin :)

[21:28] <devinus> i'm not trying to be a troll--i'm genuinely curious since i can't find anything recent through a google search--what  are the current estimates for when perl 6 will be "ready" ?

[21:28] <bkeeler> Preferably not, though if they took time to install a bidet first I guess I could make an exception

[21:28] *** Brennus joined
[21:28] <lichtkind> lue: what you mean by explosion?

[21:29] <lue> âˆš that you know your explosion principle. Yesterday I used it to derive Obama's cell phone number.

[21:29] <lue> See the xkcd.com comic I posted a link to for details: http://xkcd.com/704/

[21:31] <lue> it's a "in a nutshell" explanation. Here's Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion

[21:31] <lichtkind> devinus: whyt kind of ready you mean?

[21:32] <devinus> lichtkind: as in, "HEY EVERYBODY! HERE'S PERL 6! We encourage you to use it in production environments" or at least an "official release" maybe blessed as such by larry wall or something....

[21:33] <spinclad> devinus: 'ready' for corporate use, with a firm standing by to be sued if it doesn't work?

[21:33] <colomon> devinus: current goal is to have an "hey, we've got something cool here" release in April.

[21:33] <lue> my best guess would be Rakudo *, released in April. There is no due date, really :D

[21:33] <lichtkind> devinus: this march/april will come rakudo*

[21:34] <devinus> that's awesome, yeah i read about star on wikipedia

[21:34] <lichtkind> devinus: but there are not many modules here yet and its still slow and ram consuming

[21:34] <lue> Rakudo Whatever â€” I mean Star â€” is to be released in April ( <-- that was a P6 pun)

[21:34] <masak> devinus: the thing about the 'ready' you're talking about is that nobody knows for sure how long it'll be till that point, but it sure won't hurt to get people enthusiastic and involved in the effort.

[21:34] <lichtkind> devinus: but its considerable stable

[21:34] <lichtkind> devinus: maybe not production ready :)

[21:34] <lue> Bonvenon al Perl6, devinus!

[21:35] <devinus> well that's great

[21:35] <devinus> lichtkind: i'm guessing the libjit work in parrot hasn't helped the slowness?

[21:35] <masak> I'm sure some brave souls could use Rakudo in production.

[21:36] <lichtkind> devinus: i dont know about that, but yes parrots gets slowly faster :)

[21:36] <bkeeler> It's certainly a viable platform for experimenting and writing smallish programs in

[21:36] <lue> I guess I'm a brave soul then :)

[21:36] <bkeeler> I think it's going to be a while before people are writing the next facebook in it

[21:37] <masak> but we'll try to be ready for that.

[21:37] <lichtkind> lue: we all are :)

[21:37] <Su-Shee> well for that is just a couple of modules missing and a little more speed. ;)

[21:37] <colomon> a lot more speed... :)

[21:37] <bkeeler> what colomon said

[21:38] <lue> When Rakudo * comes out, we should all shout "Saluton mondo! Bonvenon al Perl6!" (please tell me I got that right)

[21:38] <masak> lue: you got that right.

[21:38] <lue> superluminal speed is our goal, actually. R* will be so good, it'll run at superluminal speeds even if your hardware can't run that fast!

[21:38] <colomon> Mind you, we're making strides -- master is better than twice as faster as alpha at running the master test suite.

[21:39] <colomon> *fast

[21:39] <lue> I motion to rename Master to Doctor (that way I won't get creeped when you say things like "The Master test suite")

[21:40] <masak> lue: I motion you write some Perl 6 instead of squabbling over labels :)

[21:40] <bkeeler> I'd like to spend some time with the Romana branch myself ;)

[21:41] <lue> Romana? Not familiar (I don't want to use the Majora branch, ever *shudder*)

[21:43] <bkeeler> She was one of Doctor Who's companions

[21:43] <bkeeler> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v21/volksjager/st--5h05.jpg

[21:43] <colomon> I'm already using Rakudo for some light production work here.  If it keeps doubling in speed every three months, it will be fine in a year or so....

[21:44] <masak> lue, bkeeler: you're both pretty new here. how did you two get involved with Perl 6 and #perl6? if you don't mind me asking -- I'm interested.

[21:44] <bkeeler> I've been lurking on the lists for ages

[21:44] <Su-Shee> colomon: I just shoved aside some old code and modularized it so that I can do the first p6 module in production. 

[21:45] <lue> masak: I was programming an NES emulator in Python3, when I got tired of not having pointers and switch statements...

[21:45] <colomon> Su-Shee: \o/

[21:45] <bkeeler> And been a perl programmer in one form or another since....oh, '91 I think

[21:45] <lue> masak: ...So I found Perl. I found Perl 5 a bit too different from most languages, hence Perl 6. The End.

[21:45] <masak> lue: Perl doesn't have pointers either.

[21:45] <bkeeler> I just got fed up of missing all the good chatter on #perl so I got off my ass and installed an IRC client this week

[21:45] <lue> *cough* references

[21:45] <masak> lue: and Perl 5 doesn't have switch statements :)

[21:46] <masak> lue: I thought they were called references because they're safer than pointers.

[21:46] <masak> bkeeler: but you're aware that this is #perl6, right? :P

[21:46] <bkeeler> Yeah, typoed that heh

[21:46] <masak> oh, ok.

[21:47] <bkeeler> Been following the perl6 development since the apocalypse days

[21:47] <lue> Whatever it is. I need to be able to point to the same number in the same byte of memory in two different spots in a list.

[21:48] <lue> ex. , @rray[0] and @rray[3] would both point to 0xDEADBEEF in memory.

[21:48] *** mberends joined
[21:48] <masak> mberends: oh hai! GGE now does lookarounds!

[21:48] <spinclad> \o/

[21:49] <bkeeler> Limited attention.  I've been paying more and more attention the closer rakudo gets

[21:49] <masak> so have I, I guess.

[21:49] <masak> but I was active-ish during the Pugs days, the Golden Age. :)

[21:49] <lue> \o\ \o\ |o| Saluton, mberends! |o| /o/ /o/

[21:49] <bkeeler> I could be approaching some sort of attention singularity when Rakudo * comes out, #perl6 could be wiped out my a supernova of my presence

[21:50] <colomon> bkeeler: I got hooked when they told me that here-strings would get the indent level of their command.  think it was around 2004 or so.

[21:50] <lue> I was hooked at references and switch statements :)

[21:50] <masak> bkeeler: I think we're willing to take the risk :)

[21:50] <bkeeler> I think the big turning point for me was reading A05 and E05

[21:50] <colomon> but after the initial thrill of pugs I didn't think much about p6 for a few years.

[21:50] <lue> Hi, i'm lue, and I'm a P6 addict. On occasion I use R*

[21:51] <bkeeler> It took me ages to get my jaw up off the floor

[21:51] <mberends> Masak: wow! Just playing with IRC on new android phone :

[21:51] <masak> funny how people got hooked by individual features. I think I got hooked by the project as such. I want to be a Perl 6 pioneer and use as much of the new language as I can. :)

[21:51] <masak> mberends: oh, cool.

[21:51] <Su-Shee> mberends: junkie. ;) 

[21:51] <mberends> Heh

[21:51] * lue feels glad he comes at the tail-end of P6 development, instead of starting at the beginning

[21:51] <PerlJam> lue: why?

[21:52] <lue> I didn't have to wait forever :D

[21:52] <masak> lue: how do you know it's the tail-end? :P

[21:52] <bkeeler> *grumble*grumble* want an android phone so bad *grumble*grumble* locked into Sprint contract for another 18 months *grumble*grumble*

[21:52] <PerlJam> it's not the tail

[21:52] <lue> I mean the coming of R*

[21:52] <mberends> Gotta go, talk 2morrow

[21:52] <masak> mberends: \o

[21:52] <PerlJam> well, it is the tail, but it's a really long tail ;)

[21:52] <colomon> o/

[21:52] <lue> \o\ \o\ Goodbye, mberends /o/ /o/

[21:53] <masak> lue: honestly, R* is mostly here already. it's basically alpha + laziness as far as I'm concerned.

[21:53] <masak> hm, pmichaud and jnthn might disagree :)

[21:53] <bkeeler> Yeah

[21:53] <lue> yeah, good thing ng turned into the doctor branch, right?

[21:53] <bkeeler> Grammars and s/.../.../ are what I'm really waiting on at this point

[21:53] <PerlJam> masak: having protos is significant too

[21:54] <masak> PerlJam: oh, the regexes? yeah.

[21:54] <masak> PerlJam: but it hasn't reached the Rakudo user yet, only the implementors.

[21:54] <bkeeler> My first try at using rakudo for $work was when I needed a parser for an oddball file format

[21:54] <bkeeler> Didn't work out with alpha when I tried it.  Got bogged down with the larger parse input I fed it

[21:54] <Su-Shee> I earned money with perl 6 in 2003. ;)

[21:55] <bkeeler> I'll dust that code off when master gets grammars

[21:55] <colomon> grammars are going to be awesome.  

[21:55] <colomon> pretty much are awesome already.

[21:55] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: you traded on its name?

[21:55] <bkeeler> See if it works any better

[21:55] <lue> you procured monetary goods for a paradigm of microcomputer programming? wow!

[21:55] <masak> bkeeler: nopaste it here, and we'll help you optimize it :)

[21:56] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: I wrote an article about it, sure the hype coming tomorrow. ;)

[21:56] <bkeeler> I'll see if I can do that Monday when I go in

[21:56] * PerlJam should get more interested in writing articles for money 

[21:56] <bkeeler> Well, I guess I could VPN in

[21:56] <PerlJam> more money is always good  :)

[21:56] <bkeeler> What the heck

[21:57] <lue> I have ascertained that Su-Shee's paradigm is an excellent receiver of monetary goods :)

[21:57] * lue is using fancy words for comedic effect

[22:06] <masak> Brennus: you're witnessing the exciting end of the biggest Rakudo refactor to date. :)

[22:06] <Brennus> :)

[22:06] <colomon> All the guts are there for the example, we just don't have the shortcut [+] for it.

[22:12] <lue> masak: merge your Temporal fix! Save the Doctor! DESTROY THE REALITY BOMB!!!

[22:12] * lue got carried away

[22:12] <masak> lue: sure, but my laptop battery is running out...

[22:13] <lue> no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[22:13] <lue> I use: Principle of Explosion.

[22:13] <PerlJam> colomon: how is the grammar for [+] any trickier in master from how it's implemented in alpha?

[22:13] <lue> LUE uses Principle of Explosion to derive battery power.

[22:13] <lue> LUE gives derived battery power to MASAK

[22:14] <bkeeler> Don't use it masak

[22:14] <masak> I kinda wish that would have worked.

[22:14] <bkeeler> Could be dangerous

[22:14] *** johnz left
[22:14] <masak> ya think?

[22:14] <lue> I've derived it to be safe!

[22:14] <bkeeler> You've heard of exploding laptop batteries, no?

[22:14] <colomon> PerlJam: Master cheats and just generates a separate [+], [*], etc, operator, for each infix operator.

[22:14] <PerlJam> colomon: oh, that's right.   I remember that.

[22:15] <colomon> doing it right is a lot more funky.

[22:16] <lue> colomon: would a circumfix [] possibly do any good? (then see what operator is inside, and so on)

[22:18] *** justatheory left
[22:19] <masak> lue: the thing about logic is that it's not very interesting once you introduce a contradiction. the whole 'any thing can be proved given P&!P' thing is just a way of demonstrating that. if the whole world is pink, it's hard to tell things apart.

[22:20] *** TSa left
[22:20] <masak> losing power... must find outlet...

[22:20] <lue> masak: ah, your a believer of reductio ad absurdum

[22:20] *** masak left
[22:22] <colomon> lue: The STD.pm version of the grammar is the way to go, I think -- but I find it completely incomprehensible.

[22:22] <colomon> afk

[22:23] <lue> why can't we just take STD.pm and turn it into pir code? (it's pretty lazy, but...)

[22:23] <lue> (and it probably doesn't work like that...)

[22:23] <bkeeler> The NQP-rx grammar engine isn't quite up to parsing STD yet I think

[22:24] <bkeeler> And translating it by hand into pir would be anything but lazy!

[22:25] <bkeeler> Once we get grammars in rakudo directly it might get easier

[22:25] <lue> how on earth would P6 ever support itself I wonder...? It would be cool when it happens though.

[22:25] <bkeeler> though I don't know if/when we're actually planning on porting the compiler itself to run perl6 instead of NQP

[22:27] <bkeeler> I suspect it will be a more incremental approach.  I think for ng they started with the NQP grammar and evolved it towards STD

[22:28] <lue> a self-supporting programming language is the ultimate in cross-platform! (P6 running P6)

[22:29] <bkeeler> Bootstrapping a new compiler is one of the most fascinating things to do in CS I think

[22:29] <bkeeler> Very interesting process

[22:30] <bkeeler> I remember in University discovering that C compilers were written in C and brain nearly exploded :)

[22:31] <lue> makes complete sense to me :D

[22:31] <lue> with all the power of P6, maybe someday one can compile it into machine-specific assembler (like C++ does)... \o/

[22:33] <lue> That's how I'd do it: write P6 in P6, then have a script thing turn it into assembler (PIR or machine-specific, idk)

[22:34] <bkeeler> Of course, at that time I was reading Hoffstadter's book and was getting used to having my mind blown

[22:34] <PerlJam> lue: that's kind of what happens 

[22:35] *** vamped joined
[22:35] <lue> blowing people's minds is my hobby! \o/ Especially when it comes to time/time travel >:)

[22:35] <bkeeler> paradoxes are fun

[22:35] <vamped> hello Perl6

[22:35] <bkeeler> heyas vamped

[22:35] <PerlJam> greets vamped 

[22:35] <vamped> lue: did you see my solution in the backlog?

[22:36] <lue> Saluton, vamped! Bonvenon al #perl6!

[22:36] <lue> solution to what?

[22:36] <vamped> infix <=

[22:36] <lue> ah. Haven't looked yet. (must check later)

[22:37] <vamped> works in alpha, but not master for some reason

[22:37] *** iblechbot left
[22:37] <Brennus> There are CPU sets that run LISP why not perl?

[22:38] *** devinus joined
[22:38] <bkeeler> A perlm!  That's what we need

[22:38] <Brennus> should be possible with microcode?

[22:38] <lue> when I get masak's Temporal fix, I can write my hexdate/time converter and upload everything! \o/

[22:41] *** Chillance joined
[22:41] <lue> The perlm should be called a psalm (Perl Sudden Assembler - Light Memory)

[22:41] <Brennus> hehe

[22:42] <lue> Rakudo isn't a JIT compiler; it's a AFME (A Few Minutes Early) compiler. :D

[22:42] * lue brought to you by FWAI (Fun With Acronyms International)

[22:45] <Brennus> should i be testing this release or the relatively stable one?

[22:46] <lue> whichever you want to use. We're working on the master branch right now, though.

[22:46] *** pmurias left
[22:46] *** Su-Shee left
[22:48] <PerlJam> if you're working through the advent calendar it may be best to use the Jan release.  All of those features will soon be in master, but they aren't all there yet

[22:49] <Brennus> like how soon?

[22:50] <lue> The year 20XX :D

[22:50] <PerlJam> um ... Real Soon ?

[22:50] <Brennus> Well, no hurry I suppose

[22:51] <PerlJam> Certainly before April since that's when we release Rakudo *

[22:51] <Brennus> for sure?

[22:52] <lue> yes, or else we can be sued for false advertisement (!) :)

[22:52] <bkeeler> It sounds ambitious, but I've been nothing short of amazed at the pace these guys maintain

[22:54] <frettled> And if it's not ready by April, I want my money back! :D

[22:54] <Brennus> probably some of you want your hair back

[22:55] <lue> ...yeah :/

[22:56] <Brennus> anyone here play weiqi?

[22:57] <lue> what's weiqi?

[22:57] <Brennus> go

[22:57] <Brennus> baduk

[22:59] <bkeeler> Mornington Crescent!

[22:59] <Brennus> I wrote a client for the internet go server with cocoa & camelbones

[23:01] <bkeeler> Ooh, hadn't heard of camelbones.  Looks interesting

[23:01] <Brennus> it works fine but it is a major PITA to debug

[23:02] <lichtkind> hereby i solemnly declare, the perl 6 wiki frontpage is now       free of clutter

[23:02] <Brennus> you can't get any of the perl messages, or at least I haven't figured out how to

[23:02] <Brennus> it just has to work when you run it

[23:03] <Brennus> else the whole thing dies with a useless message

[23:03] <frettled> bkeeler: that announcement was a bit premature, I think you've forgotten the rules change introduced by Warwick in 1952.

[23:03] <frettled> (oops, typo, 1852)

[23:04] <bkeeler> Ah yes, you're quite right Sir, my apologies

[23:04] <bkeeler> Picadillly Circus!

[23:05] <frettled> I just passed Uxbridge.

[23:06] <bkeeler> Hmmm...

[23:06] <bkeeler> Ealing Common

[23:08] <frettled> I wonder if this is too obscure, maybe we should head for Finchley Central instead.

[23:08] <bkeeler> Odd move

[23:09] <bkeeler> Aha, I see what you're up to

[23:09] * frettled taps the side of his nose meaningfully.

[23:09] <bkeeler> Going to try the ol Jubilee line gambit are we?

[23:09] *** wolf2k_ubuntu left
[23:09] <bkeeler> Well, I'll have to backtrack a bit

[23:09] <frettled> Oh, no, you're not getting me to reveal my plan, that's against the Mornsborough Principle.

[23:09] <bkeeler> Embankment!

[23:09] * frettled sucks his breath.

[23:10] <frettled> Well played, sir, well played.

[23:12] <frettled> Well, you nearly got me at Hammersmith, but I'm actually at King's Cross now.

[23:13] <lue> Objection!

[23:13] <frettled> Pardon?

[23:13] * lue doesn't know this game

[23:14] <frettled> Well, that's hardly a excuse, is it?  According to Lyttelton, a lack of knowledge of the rules is no excuse at all.

[23:14] * bkeeler ponders feinting toward Leicester Square, but reconsiders

[23:14] <lue> Verily, Sir. Ergo!

[23:14] <lue> I beg pardonage

[23:15] * bkeeler doffs his hat at the mention of the great man

[23:16] * bkeeler realizes he's not actually wearing a hat and dons one so he can doff it

[23:16] <lue> Rickmansworthshiretown says that the game is not to be underestimated.

[23:17] <bkeeler> Hmm, I think I'll try Leicester Square after all

[23:17] <bkeeler> If I lose I can always take in a show

[23:17] <frettled> Very well, then.  Camden Town.

[23:17] <bkeeler> Oof!

[23:17] <bkeeler> Oh dear, got myself trapped on the wrong line again

[23:18] <frettled> A-ha1

[23:18] <frettled> s/1/!/

[23:18] <bkeeler> Oh well, I have no choice but to retreat back to Piccadilly, dammit

[23:19] <frettled> Hah, got you!  Mornington Crescent.  I'll buy you lunch at the Ministry when you get here.

[23:19] <bkeeler> Well played, well played

[23:23] <frettled> It was a nice game, to be sure!

[23:24] *** jferrero joined
[23:24] <lue> is it over, the game?

[23:24] <bkeeler> Fraid so, he got there before me

[23:25] <lue> good.

[23:26] <frettled> lue: If you find a decent antique bookshop, maybe you can pick up Stovoldâ€™s Mornington Crescent: Rules and Origins, or more likely, The Little Book of Mornington Crescent by Tim, Graeme, Barry and Humph.

[23:33] <Brennus> cute

[23:33] <lue> any of you ever been on ifMUD?

[23:34] <bkeeler> Haven't played any muds since the early nineties

[23:35] <lue> haven't been on ifMUD for a while, thinking of maybe getting back into it...

[23:35] <Brennus> i played in a couple of vampire games at CMU & Manchester

[23:35] <frettled> lue: nopes, sorry, I haven't played any of the new muds.

[23:36] <Brennus> the CMU was really detailed around CMU (naturally)

[23:36] <lue> yeah, just seeing if anyone had (must ask later as well)

[23:36] <frettled> I think the most recent MUD I played was ZombieMUD or something like that, but maybe Medieval Nights was more recent.

[23:37] <frettled> I'm still socializing on VikingMUD, though, and I'm thinking about how to plan for the 20-year anniversary.
