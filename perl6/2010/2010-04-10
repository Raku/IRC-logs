[07:34] <k23z__> hai

[07:34] <k23z__> hai masak

[07:35] <k23z__> I wants to ask if there is plans for symbolic computations like SymPy for Perl6 ?

[07:35] <masak> no plans as far as I know.

[07:35] <masak> would be fun if someone made it a project.

[07:36] <k23z__> because I was trying recently to work out Math::Symbolic from Perl5 and I encountered serious problems at which point I switched to SymPy

[07:36] <sorear> "Not competing with Mathematica" is a stated design goal

[07:36] <sorear> Rakudo build performance has increased 60 fold since I joined the project

[07:37] <sorear> I just tried it, if finished in 13 minutes

[07:37] <sorear> that's like, 1 month

[07:37] <moritz_> masak: do you agree with adding a Date-only type on Temporal?

[07:38] <masak> moritz_: I'd tend to agree with anything autarch says :)

[07:38] <masak> moritz_: what I am wondering is this: if there's to be a standalone Date type, is there also a need for a standalone Time type?

[07:38] <masak> maybe I should ask him that on the list...

[07:38] <moritz_> not sure

[07:40] <k23z__> anyone here know a good book on writing a Symbolic computation package ?

[07:40] <k23z__> the main problem is that for example Math::Symbolic produces big expression trees that are hard to manipulate

[07:42] *** k23z__ is now known as kerz___

[07:42] <moritz_> I think that's the main problem with all CAS packages

[07:42] <moritz_> because simplifying an expression tends to take exponential time

[07:44] <kerz___> well Math::Symbolic has  Math::Symbolic::Custom::Transformation

[07:44] <kerz___> with it you can write transformation for the expression trees

[07:44] *** mberends joined
[07:45] <kerz___> thus yielding bigger or smaller expressions depending on desire

[07:45] <kerz___> but it has problems ... like for example I have to apply a lot of time some transformations to get the desired result

[07:46] <kerz___> and when I print my expression it has lots of redundant parenthesis

[07:46] <mberends> \o masak, I suggest a 'use Date' and Date.pm6 as an immediate solution

[07:47] <mberends> for the question of whether Date as a type should be in core

[07:48] <mberends> (I prefer to avoid core bloat)

[07:50] <masak> I can definitely agree with that perspective.

[07:51] <masak> it's still debatable whether DateTime itself belongs in core...

[07:51] <mberends> we're starting to see candidate modules to be shipped with Rakudo *

[07:52] <mberends> masak: well we need something time-related in the core, it's always a matter of drawing the line

[07:53] <masak> *nod*

[07:53] <mberends> masak: something derived from proto's Installer.pm and Ecosystem.pm will also go into Rakudo * ;)

[07:54] <mberends> and we have Test.pm and Safe.pm.  I hope we begin copying them all to ~/.perl6/lib/ soon

[07:54] <moritz_> nope

[07:55] <moritz_> packages shipped with rakudo belong in the rakudo install dir

[07:55] <moritz_> so that a site wide install gets all the modules

[07:56] <mberends> yes, that's better

[15:31] <ash__> what about years less than 1900? or in BC? 

[15:31] <ash__> :p

[15:31] <ash__> (lots of date tools don't go very far backwards) 

[15:31] <moritz_> less than 1900 can still be written as 0120 or so

[15:33] <ash__> how are you planning on storing the year? i don't see why it should stop at 9999

[15:36] <TimToady> and year 1 BC is really 0 AD, and 2 BC is -1 AD, and so on.  :) * 1/3

[15:40] <moritz_> ash__: integers... It's more about allowed formats for the constructor

[15:40] <moritz_> ash__: but in the end I think it's sane to allow Date.new('YYYY-MM-DD') for years 0 to 9999, and require Date.new(:year(2e6), :day(), :month()) for all years outside that range

[15:45] <ash__> doesn't YYYY-MM-DD have a name? 

[15:45] <ash__> like, that style of format

[15:47] <ash__> you could do Date.iso-8601('YYYY-MM-DD') format

[15:47] <ash__> i should probably read the new temporal before i start making stupid suggestions though

[15:48] <moritz_> after the discussion today or yesterday I thought I'd prototype a Date (no time) module

[15:48] <moritz_> and then ask people if they want something like that in core or not

[15:48] <moritz_> s/not/as an external module/

[15:49] <moritz_> anway, going away for a while...

[15:49] <ash__> Date.new just seems vague, IMO 

[15:51] <ash__> i am obviously nit-picking the name of the constructor, but in this case i think Date.new can be confusing because there are so many different ways you can construct a date, being explicit might be useful to the date module to reduce confusion 

[15:52] <moritz_> that's why I want MMD and awesome error messages 

[15:52] <moritz_> and a very narrow selection of allowed things

[15:52] <ash__> Date.now (new date with the current time), Date.iso-8601, etc.

[19:57] <lue> where you can't call rakudo by navigating the directories (i.e. ../perl6 or rakudo/perl6)

[19:58] <mberends> lue: it works locally, but could be related to this "parrot_install/bin" dependency. The perl6 in the rakudo directory is not expected to work when run from any other directory.

[19:59] <lue> that seems a bit counter-productive. :)

[19:59] <mberends> so it's documented. That makes it a "feature", not a "bug" ;P

[20:01] <mberends> because "make install" solves the problem, there is no incentive to work on a second solution.

[20:01] <colomon> except maybe giving a better error message when you haven't done "make install" (like alpha did)

[20:02] <lue> I'm not the BDFL on the server I work on (so I don't feel like mucking around with make install), and locally I don't have the resources to compile anything I could install! :(

[20:02] <lue> (I could make a symlink, but...)

[20:02] <colomon> lue: for rakudo, make install installs locally by default.  You don't need any fancy permissions.

[20:03] <lue> :D

[20:04] <mberends> colomon: good point, probably worth a little look

[20:04] <lue> but perl6 doesn't work after make install :( (still would need ./perl)

[20:05] <mberends> lue: instead of "ln -s" you could define a bash alias

[20:05] <lue> ō.o

[20:06] <cotto> ooc, what kind of obstacles exist to writing a Perl 6 compiler targeting the DLR?

[20:06] *** cls_bsd_ is now known as cls_bsd

[20:06] <pmurias> lack of manpower?

[20:07] <cotto> there's a gsoc proposal about doing that and I'm curious what kind of difficulties the student will face

[20:08] <diakopter> 1. The student would need to use one of the existing parsers, since implementing one of those for Perl 6 takes years

[20:09] <pmurias> with STD and rakudo's one being the do sensible possibilitys

[20:10] <cotto> Yeah.  I guess the vastness of Perl 6 itself would be the biggest hurdle.

[20:10] <diakopter> 2. Perl 6 control flow (return via exceptions) is different enough from the CLRs that using Callsites in the DLR wouldn't gain anything.

[20:12] <mberends> a scaled down but very achievable goal would be to add a DLR emitter to Perlito.

[20:13] <diakopter> 3. Perl 6 types need multiple inheritance and roles; the binding and dispatch builders in the languages already implemented on the DLR wouldn't be of much help.

[20:14] <cotto> perlito?

[20:15] <pmurias> fglock's subset of Perl 6 to multiple backends compiler 

[20:15] <diakopter> http://github.com/fglock/Perlito

[20:16] <diakopter> 4. Perl 6's multiple-stage compilation/evaluation is an issue that I'm not sure the DLR can surmount.

[20:17] <mberends> see also http://www.perlito.org/ and try it online: http://www.perlito.org/js/

[20:17] <pmurias> diakopter: sprixel targets .NET right?

[20:17] <diakopter> pmurias: yes, in addition to the first stage being written in C#

[20:18] <pmurias> first stage?

[20:18] <diakopter> yes.  akin to rakudo's stage0, stage1, etc.

[20:19] <pmurias> sprixel lives at http://github.com/diakopter/sprixel?

[20:19] <diakopter> no

[20:20] <pmurias> diakopter: where can i find that?

[20:21] <diakopter> cotto: do you have any comments on the other points I mentioned?

[20:21] <diakopter> pmurias: it's embedded somewhere in csmeta.org

[20:26] <cotto> diakopter, no

[20:49] <diakopter> oh

[20:49] <diakopter> hee

[20:57] * pmurias wanders if there are any privates comments on his gsoc proposal ;)

[20:58] <mberends> diakopter++: the Sprixel first stage roadmap http://code.google.com/p/csmeta/source/browse/trunk/Sprixel/notes.txt describes a fairly powerful bootstrapping language. Linking to any .NET class is a brilliant feature. How complete is the Sprixel0 implementation?

[21:00] <diakopter> not very

[21:01] <diakopter> static invocations work, e.g. Console.WriteLine("blah", 4432 + 332)

[21:02] <diakopter> I'm just finishing up named sub declarations

[21:02] <mberends> that must already have a lot of underlying code working. These things don't come easily.

[21:03] <masak> diakopter++

[21:04] <diakopter> today, I'm thinking it will be an assembly language, targetted by viv and/or nqp-rx

[21:04] <diakopter> at least until I can get associativity working in the expression parser

[21:04] <diakopter> but until then, precedence must have parens

[21:05] <diakopter> I'm hoping that STD will be able to compile itself to this language, which I'm calling perlesque

[21:05] <masak> perlesque \o/

[21:06] <mberends> masak: Sprixel0 almost compiles on Linux as well, using mono 2.4.4

[21:06] <diakopter> lots of transformations will be needed in its edition of viv; it probably won't be able to infer types in STD's output, so something will need to be done there

[21:06] <diakopter> but "a lot can be accomplished with closures"

[21:06] <masak> mberends: nice

[21:07] <masak> :)

[21:08] <diakopter> also, class declarations, sorta like PIR's

[21:09] <diakopter> including generics eventually, I guess

[21:09] <diakopter> so basically, a very small strongly typed impure functional subset of Perl 5/6

[21:10] <mberends> sounds like a fun language :)

[21:12] <diakopter> it'll remain vaporware, though, for a while longer.  if anyone wants to help, they could take a look at extending viv to other emitters

[21:13] <diakopter> or to help TimToady in his quest to make viv --p5 emit the same thing as gimme5

[21:13] <diakopter> , from which would provide a stable starting point to derive a perlesque emitter

[21:14] <masak> ah. gotcha.

[21:15] <masak> is that still the way to get at a method in Perl 6?

[21:21] <ash__> i only know of using .^methods

[21:21] <ash__> to get a method

[21:21] <ash__> rakudo: class Foo { method f { say 'f' } }; my $a = Foo.^methods(:local); say $a[0]();

[21:21] <p6eval> rakudo 43f865: OUTPUT«Not enough positional parameters passed; got 0 but expected 1␤current instr.: 'perl6;Foo;f' pc 450 (EVAL_1:178)␤»

[21:22] <ash__> ehe, still nees a self 

[21:22] <ash__> needs* 

[21:22] <masak> I've previously been using &Class::methodname to get at a method, and it's worked.

[21:22] <ash__> maybe thats supposed to work

[21:23] <ash__> rakudo: class Foo { method f { say 'f' } }; my $a = Foo.^methods(:local); $a[0]();

[21:23] <p6eval> rakudo 43f865: OUTPUT«Not enough positional parameters passed; got 0 but expected 1␤current instr.: 'perl6;Foo;f' pc 439 (EVAL_1:177)␤»

[21:23] <ash__> oops

[21:24] <ash__> rakudo: class Foo { method f { say 'f' } }; my $a = Foo.^methods(:local); $a[0]('lol_not a foo');

[21:24] <masak> I'm kinda expecting to use a way that doesn't involve the introspect API.

[21:24] <p6eval> rakudo 43f865: OUTPUT«f␤»

[21:24] <masak> mostly because I haven't needed it for this before.

[21:24] <ash__> well, maybe we should ask someone about &Class::methodname that seems perfectly reasonable 

[21:25] <masak> I'm all for asking someone perfectly reasonable :)

[21:25] * mberends seems perfectly reasonable, until asked such a question ;)

[21:26] <ash__> is there a &() context? 

[21:27] <colomon> is the alternative Class::&methodname?  I feel like I'm missing context in this discussion...

[21:28] <ash__> would be nice to also grab methods off an instance as a closure, so you don't have to pass self 

[21:28] * colomon should probably go downstairs and find out what his father-in-law is doing to the house's electrical system...

[21:29] <masak> ash__: you can always do that manually, through a closure. I did that in Rakudo back in late 2008 :)

[21:29] <masak> I was greatly surprised that it worked...

[21:30] <ash__> yeah, but if your talking convenient method accessors... 

[21:30] *** JohnDoe365 joined
[21:30] <ash__> doing like: my &a = &($foo.methodname);  and having it still bound to $foo might be nice

[21:30] <masak> in my case, I just expect to send in the invocant parameter as the first argument.

[21:31] <ash__> i guess thats currying isn't it? 

[21:31] <masak> no, it's passing the invocant parameter to something which has the form of a sub :)

[21:32] <masak> alpha: class A { method foo($message) { say $message } }; my $bar = &A::foo; my $a = A.new; $bar($a, "OH HAI")

[21:33] *** sundar joined
[21:33] <masak> I guess that's currying, though...

[21:38] <masak> ah. I seemed to remember it was something like that.

[21:39] <ash__> is that the proper way of doing it? 

[21:39] <masak> I think jnthn++ said so.

[21:40] <masak> slightly surprising, in my opinion. :)

[21:41] <ash__> http://perlcabal.org/~azawawi/html/spec/S12-introspection/can.t.html has an example of that

[21:43] * mberends goes to sleep, o/

[21:43] <colomon> \o

[21:43] *** mberends left
[21:43] <masak> o/

[21:44] <masak> hm; I guess technically it is introspection, too. :)

[21:44] <masak> but at least it doesn't explicitly involve the metaclass.

[21:48] <ruoso> ash__, in Perl 6 methods are not registered in the package by default... 

[21:49] <ruoso> rakudo: class A { our method foo($message) { say $message } }; my $bar = &a::foo; my $a = A.new; $bar($a, "Hello");

[21:49] <p6eval> rakudo 43f865: OUTPUT«Null PMC access in can()␤current instr.: '&infix:<=>' pc 16989 (src/builtins/Junction.pir:245)␤»

[21:49] <ash__> so doing &Classname::methodname shouldn't work? 

[21:49] <ash__> unless you use our

[21:49] <ruoso> ash__, unless you have a "our method"

[21:49] <ash__> got ya

[21:49] <masak> ah.

[21:49] <ruoso> rakudo: class A { our method foo($message) { say $message } }; my $bar = &A::foo; my $a = A.new; $bar($a, "Hello");

[21:49] <p6eval> rakudo 43f865: OUTPUT«Hello␤»

[21:51] <ruoso> it's important to notice that this &A::foo lookup is absolutely non-OO

[21:51] <ruoso> it will look for a routine declared in that package

[21:52] <ash__> rakudo: class A { our method foo($message) { say $message } }; my $a = A.new; my &bar = &A::foo.assuming(self => $a); &bar("Hi");

[21:52] <masak> gotcha.

[21:53] <ash__> cool

[22:49] * lue is looking at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_personal_pronouns for guidance

[22:50] *** snarkyboojum joined
[22:51] <lue> o hai snarkyboojum o/

[22:51] <lue> (right now I'm trying to find an english language equivalent to %_)

[22:52] <snarkyboojum> hi lue

[22:54] * lue is currently resorting to old english, before moving on to other languages

[22:57] <pugssvn> r30361 | lwall++ | [STD] clean up some unneeded locmesses 

[22:57] <pugssvn> r30361 | distinguish "Parse failed" from "Check failed"

[22:59] <lue> TimToady++ for clarity :)

[23:02] <lue> .oO(is there a language out there that defines a pronoun referring to a hash-like structure?)

[23:03] <lue> afk (in the meantime considering inventing a new english word if nothing else)

[23:03] *** masak left
[23:08] *** orafu left
[23:08] *** orafu joined
[23:11] <snarkyboojum> re inconsistency in method naming in Temporal.pm, 'multi method day-of-week' vs 'multi method from_epoch' for example?

[23:20] <ruoso> damian++  "that's a very sad reflection on our profession."

[23:21] <ruoso> heh

[23:31] *** payload joined
[23:34] *** payload1 joined
[23:34] *** payload left
[23:42] <snarkyboojum> not an argument though :)

[23:54] <arnsholt> ruoso: Where's that from?

[23:54] <TimToady> std: my $x; "$x\[nonesuch\]";

[23:54] <p6eval> std 30361: OUTPUT«ok 00:01 109m␤»

[23:55] <diakopter> arnsholt: p6l

[23:55] <arnsholt> Ah, right. I should probably subscribe to p6l
