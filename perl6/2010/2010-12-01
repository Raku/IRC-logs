[01:27] <TimToady> the person who does it will know it first

[01:30] <sjohnson> oops, i meant to ask, if anyone knows if it has already been done

[01:37] <sjohnson> flussence: i dont know, is that the solution in p5?

[01:37] <flussence> I'm guessing that's the p6 name of it...

[01:38] <flussence> with the direction p5's going in, it'll probably get backported sooner or later

[01:38] <sjohnson> i hope!

[01:38] <sjohnson> in case you are curious, i am currently doing this.  perhaps my solution is a bit juvenile:

[01:38] <sjohnson> http://www.pastie.org/1337121

[01:42] <sjohnson> there was a time where i had a string set to 'i' and did:  s/moo/oink/$flag;  but it quit working.. perhaps a newer version didn't like my cludgey idea.

[01:45] <flussence> it might work as /(?$flag)/

[02:09] <Frank_> Just curious -- I thought this might be a good time for me to check out Perl 6. Most of the docs for newcomers seems to suggest using Rakudo. Rakudo.org seems to have been down for several days now, and I haven't been able to find any announcements anywhere.

[02:10] <ash_> if you just want to try some things, you can do: 

[02:10] <ash_> rakudo: say 1; 

[02:10] <p6eval> rakudo : OUTPUT«1␤»

[02:11] <ash_> or http://try.rakudo.org/ 

[02:11] <ash_> or checkout http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo or http://github.com/rakudo/star 

[02:11] <ash_> i am sure someone's working on the rakudo.org site being down, which kinda stinks :-(

[02:12] <ash_> http://planetsix.perl.org/ has a lot of blog posts about perl6 

[02:12] <Frank_> Ah, thanks, ash_, that should get me going.

[02:12] <ash_> http://perlgeek.de/en/article/5-to-6 is good if you know perl5

[02:13] <Frank_> It just seemed weird that almost no one seemed to notice the site was down, or at least didn't think it worth mentioning.

[02:14] <ash_> someone mentioned it being down earlier

[02:18] <ash_> someones donating a vm slice for rakudo, so, it might be something wrong on their end? I am not sure, i don't manage that site 

[02:18] <Frank_> the post by masak was the only one I could find, and that had more of a "please help me" tone than informative. I'm hoping this just means that someone is too busy fixing the problem to post an update.

[13:18] <masak> sorear: why is the executable called 'niecza_eval' rather than just 'niecza'?

[13:18] <masak> or 'perl6'? :)

[13:20] <dalek> tpfwiki: (Herbert Breunung)++ | http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_io_tablet

[13:21] <moritz_> naming the executable 'perl6' is a bad idea, IMHO

[13:22] *** MayDaniel joined
[13:22] <masak> moritz_: in that case, what makes it a good idea to do it for Rakudo?

[13:22] <moritz_> masak: I think the reason was the presence of Niecza folder, which collided with the niecza executable on case insensitive file systems

[13:22] <moritz_> masak: nothing

[13:23] <flussence> well, the binary name wasn't taken at the time :D

[13:23] <masak> but there's no Niecza folder. at least not anymore.

[13:24] <masak> moritz_: also, could you motivate why it'd be a bad idea?

[13:24] <moritz_> masak: because it's not the perl 6, but a perl 6 - rakudo perl 6, to be specific

[13:25] *** bitter16 joined
[13:25] *** sftp joined
[13:28] <masak> moritz_: not sure I buy that. we're supposed to eventually be calling the executable 'perl', aren't we?

[13:28] <masak> or is that a vestige of the Perl-6-is-a-successor world view?

[13:29] *** maluco joined
[13:29] <moritz_> masak: I think that I want to have an easy way to call each perl 6 compiler on my machine

[13:29] <flussence> IMO, call the executable perl$version and let the distros decide what to symlink.

[13:30] <moritz_> having them all named 'perl6', because they all assume they are "the perl6" would be counterproductive

[13:30] <moritz_> I'd much rather install a perl6 alias myself when I decide which one is "the perl6" for me now

[13:31] <dalek> tpfwiki: (Herbert Breunung)++ | http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_variable_tablet

[13:31] *** Axius left
[13:32] <masak> moritz_: but you're something of a power user. I can easily see people who don't care about implementations and distributions wanting to have a 'perl6' binary or alias installed for them by default.

[13:32] <mathw> Inscribed on my tuppence is the opinion that Rakudo should have a binary called 'rakudo'. A perl6 symlink or alias can easily be provided by packagers.

[14:07] <masak> I haven't finished reading yet.

[14:08] <masak> there's an unwanted newline after 'built' before 'around it'.

[14:08] <masak> also, I wonder whether there shouldn't be a new paragraph after 'ecosystem.'

[14:08] <tadzik> it seems like html didn't format the paragraphs for me

[14:54] <masak> immediate observation from using niecza: it may be faster than rakudo, but it has a longer startup time.

[14:55] <takadonet> by how much?

[14:56] <masak> timing both once with -e 'say 42' gives 5.2s for niecza and 1.9s for rakudo here.

[15:34] <ch3ck3r> masak: not at all - i'm still using perl 5

[15:34] <masak> I'm still using Perl 5 too. it's a fine language.

[15:35] <ch3ck3r> yeah

[15:35] <moritz_> and it has a great ecosystem

[15:36] <masak> ch3ck3r: but if you thought "i'm still using perl 5" was a reason for "not at all [exploring Perl 6]" then I must both disagree and put on a look of honest confusion.

[15:36] <ch3ck3r> :)

[15:36] <ch3ck3r> well

[15:37] <ch3ck3r> i was reading was wikipedia has to say about perl 6

[15:37] <ch3ck3r> is that ok? ;)

[15:37] <masak> it's a start.

[15:37] <PerlJam> ch3ck3r: the places where it says perl 6 is vaporware are lying :)

[15:38] <ch3ck3r> hrhr

[15:38] <masak> anyway, I was just curious. you've started greeting me, so I thought it'd be ok to start querying you about your "spiritual development" on the channel. :)

[15:38] <masak> PerlJam: it says that? :(

[15:38] <PerlJam> masak: there are some entries that (used to) talk about Perl 6 in those terms.

[15:38] <PerlJam> I haven't looked recently.

[15:41] *** hercynium joined
[15:41] <moritz_> or the corresponding section in the Perl 6 article was

[15:41] <tadzik> cute

[15:42] <tadzik> that'd be a nice GCI task

[15:42] <tadzik> bringing wikipages up to date

[15:42] <rjbs> P6 Advent Editor: English does not use subscribe quotation marks, ever.

[15:42] <tadzik> hm?

[15:43] <rjbs> The „official” part

[15:43] <tadzik> oh, my fault

[15:43] <rjbs>  "official" or “official”

[15:43] <tadzik> “official”, right?

[15:43] <tadzik> right

[15:43] <moritz_> rjbs++

[15:43] <rjbs> Not a big deal, but will confuse English readers who have not encountered bizarre foreign customers. :)

[15:43] <rjbs> customs, even

[15:43] <tadzik> In Polish you use „this kind of quotes”

[15:44] <tadzik> fixed-faxed

[15:46] <PerlJam> It didn't confuse me and I've never seen those sort of quotes before.

[15:46] <PerlJam> But then perhaps I'm biased toward the strange a little bit by virtue of hanging out here :)

[15:47] <flussence> use <q> tags, then it becomes the browser's problem

[15:53] <mathw> I noticed, but I figured it's not really all that important. English speakers would be far more confused by « » quoting.

[15:54] <moritz_> really? I've seen them in books all the time

[15:54] <moritz_> but maybe those weren't english books :-)

[15:54] <masak> likely not.

[15:55] <tadzik> I've seen them in Polish books too

[15:56] *** plobsing left
[15:56] <mathw> I first encountered them in a German translation of a Star Wars book

[15:56] <PerlJam> Why would english speakers be confused by guillemets?

[15:56] <mathw> they never show up in native English, we generally don't even know the characters exist

[15:57] <PerlJam> I always go with "the reader is smart" and will figure out what these symbols mean based on the context in which they are used.

[15:57] <mathw> I've only seen them a few times in English text, always written by non-native speakers

[15:58] <mathw> yeah people could probably figure them out by context

[15:58] <rjbs> I don't think anybody would really be confused.

[15:58] *** plobsing joined
[15:58] <rjbs> It's just incorrect, and would be easier to read if corrected.

[15:58] <rjbs> In other words: it would slow down reading.

[15:59] <PerlJam> rjbs: only the first time they were encountered.  :)

[15:59] <rjbs> Sure, but why use them at all?

[15:59] <rjbs> Anyway, not trying to be a pedant, just trying to help keep things smooth sailin'

[15:59] <PerlJam> This is Perl 6 we're talking about!  People should embrace strange symbols and get used to seeing them now rather than later.

[16:05] <rjbs> tadzik: The world may never know.

[16:05] <PerlJam> tadzik: no, I think he was being sincere rather than sarcastic

[16:05] <PerlJam> (at least I'd like to believe that so it must be so :)

[16:06] <rjbs> If I wanted to publish a web design advent calendar, I would want it to look better than http://24ways.org/

[16:07] <PerlJam> masak: Here's something to think about then: when you hugged rjbs, I considered doing the same and then I thought, "what if everybody hugged rjbs?" and then I coined "hugpile" in my head.  So, feel free to start hugpiles anytime :)

[16:07] <tadzik> "terrible" sounds like something that can be either sarcarstic or nice

[16:08] <tadzik> or even sarcastic. Colemak is hard

[16:08] <masak> PerlJam: in a circle of friends I'm part of, we already have hugpiles. but we call them "hugging according to the principles of Dr. Volkov" :)

[16:09] <masak> PerlJam: I've been at the bottom of such a pile. with five or so people on top of you, it's hard to breathe. also, my mobile phone lost a couple of functions from the pressure. but overall it was still a nice experience.

[21:49] <sorear> I've cut the number of Perl6-level method calls by nearly 25% but that hasn't translated into a big performance improvement :/

[21:50] <Tene> sorear: you need to make your method calls slower first, so that that would be a bigger improvement.

[21:50] <Tene> And then you could make your method calls fast again, getting a second improvement.

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: [README] a few updates

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: 

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: - Added the location of ufo.

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: - Can now do both immediate and non-immediate blocks.

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: - Changed wording to reflect this.

[22:39] <dalek> yapsi: - Also changed the example.

[22:39] <sorear> hi masak!

[22:39] <masak> henceforth today when I say "announcement", I'll be talking about the Yapsi 2010.12 announcement, not the Big Announcement nine days from now :)

[22:41] <jnthn> .oO( "Release number 5 of Yapsi is quite a task, 'cus I'm doing it on a satellite uplink from the Amazon..." )

[22:44] <lue> hai masak o/

[22:44] <masak> jnthn: bonus points for incorporating all the clues so far. :P but no, Big Announcement is nine days from now, not tonight.

[22:44] <jnthn> Aww.

[22:45] <masak> lue: I'm not too worried about slot 5 being empty. I do hope more people will volunteer as authors, though.

[22:45] <sjohnson> huf: just was jokin around :)

[22:45] <masak> this is a clear case of many cooks improving the broth :)

[22:47] <lue> .oO("As you can see in this pot of broth, there's this empty space, a cube of air for Broth #5 when it comes along.")

[22:50] <sjohnson> .oO(i wonder what i'm going to have for lunch)

[22:51] <masak> you guys think too much.

[22:51] * lue considers learning Temporal to teach it to the masses, or maybe another topic...

[22:52] <sjohnson> masak: once perl 6 is widespread on systems i use by default, i'll get to think much less

[22:52] * sjohnson is looking forward to that day

[22:52] <masak> lue: I like the choice of topic. that's something that's largely new since last December.

[22:53] <lue> , although the fact I've never used the current Temporal. Then again, I'm an avid fan of Time [ in case it wasn't obvious before :) ] ...

[22:54] <lue> s/although/despite/

[22:55] <masak> never too late to start using Temporal.

[22:55] <masak> and if you want to give yourself more time, you don't have to claim slot #5.

[22:56] <masak> one mean comment so far on http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eeont/perl_6_advent_calendar_2010_has_begun/

[22:56] <masak> try to be kind to the poor misguided person who posted it. please. :)

[22:57] <lue> If I go Temporal, I wouldn't claim slot 5. I think having a sequence of posts go "2. MAIN sub    3. File Operations    4. Sequences    5. TIME BENDING!" doesn't seem right :)

[22:58] <sjohnson> masak: which irc client do you use?

[22:58] <sjohnson> just complete curiosity

[22:59] <masak> sjohnson: Emacs ERC.

[22:59] <sjohnson> interesting

[22:59] <sjohnson> didnt know emacs had irc

[22:59] <sjohnson> is it official, or a 3rd party plugin some guy wrote for emacs?

[23:00] <masak> sjohnson: I don't know. it came with Carbon Emacs, but that doesn't say much.

[23:00] <jnthn> Doesn't emacs have everything? ;)

[23:00] <lue> It has an organizer! \o/

[23:01] <jnthn> I bet it even has a girlfriend.

[23:01] <jnthn> And a unicorn.

[23:01] <lue> [I got ERC on what I think is a 'vanilla' release (just emacs)]

[23:01] * flussence refrains from eviscerating reddit users off the bat this time

[23:01] <lue> the org-mode (the organizer) logo IS A UNICORN! :O

[23:08] <sjohnson> <--- likes Vim a lot

[23:10] <lue> or rather, do you put POD docs in mu/misc/perl6advent-2010/articles and then some bot posts it for you, or do you just put POD copies of the post in the repo?

[23:34] <masak> did I misspell "structural"? hm, no, seems I didn't.
