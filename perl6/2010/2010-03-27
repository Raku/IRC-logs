[01:09] <colomon> what's the test file for testing Test.pm?

[01:11] <mberends> colomon: hopefully you're just asking a rhetorical question ;)

[01:11] <colomon> nope.

[01:11] <mberends> there isn't a test test

[01:11] <colomon> t/01-sanity/99-test-basic.t actually appears to be.

[01:11] <colomon> not very sophisticated tests, however.

[01:11] <mberends> indeed

[01:12] <colomon> I've just added a new "is" locally, which takes two iterables and compares them member by member.

[01:13] <colomon> trying to figure out how to test what I have done.

[01:13] <colomon> and if it is a good idea...

[01:15] <mberends> is() is nice. I've used perldoc Test::More as guidance for that before

[01:20] <colomon> the problem is comparing two Iterables has become a bit tricky, and give lousy feedback.

[01:20] <colomon> It's why all those "GatherIterator" messages show up when tests fail.

[01:24] <mberends> it should be sufficient to show the first element that differs, the possibilities vary too much after that

[01:25] <colomon> The version I coded tries to get all the elements in each array to list, but I suppose that doesn't work if one of the lists is infinite.

[01:27] <mberends> soon you'll be implementing diff inside Test.pm ;)

[01:28] <colomon> dear heavens, I hope not.

[01:38] <colomon> dammit, nopaste is down again.

[01:41] * mberends likes it

[01:42] <colomon> no idea if it works, but it does compile.  :)

[01:42] <mberends> is the gather really necessary?

[01:43] <colomon> oh, nope!

[01:43] <colomon> cut-n-paste mistake.

[01:43] <mberends> the missing take looked suspicious

[01:44] <colomon> indeed, I remembered to delete the take.

[01:45] <mberends> the output on huge data sets will be unwieldy though

[01:45] <colomon> sure, but we probably shouldn't be doing tests on huge data sets.

[01:46] <mberends> true as  well

[01:46] <colomon> it's still a lot more wieldy than what we have now, at any rate.  :)

[01:47] <mberends> if it compiles, ship it!

[01:55] <mberends> the use of try on lines 22-23 looks a bit strange, without CATCH. Did you do that because of empty arrays, or completely undefined arrays?

[11:56] <levengli> i am thinking of a project that requires it

[11:56] <levengli> also, i saw STD.pm - it appears to be Pelr6 syntax. is it readable by a parser?

[11:58] <colomon> all the sites I know of which host the perl6 spec are also down at the moment.  :(

[11:59] <colomon> STD.pm is Perl6.

[12:00] <colomon> There is some sort of funky script out there which translates it to Perl 5 code so it can be used to parse things now.

[12:00] <colomon> So far as I know, there is no proper Perl 6 implementation capable of parsing it yet.

[12:01] <m6locks> lol at perl6 spec being down

[12:02] <colomon> Well, it's stored in the same SVN repo as t/spec -- if one is down, the other one is too.

[12:03] <colomon> and the convenient on-line version I usually use appears to run off those same computers as well, or at least is also down at the moment.

[15:35] <levengli> will do

[15:35] <levengli> i am now rebuildig it though, with parrot that synaptic downloaded

[15:35] <levengli> at which stage in the process to i tell it to install to /usr/bin as opposed to the download directory?

[15:36] <moritz_> levengli: perl Configure --parrot-config=/usr/bin/parrot_config

[15:36] <moritz_> levengli: it will install to the same location

[15:37] <moritz_> levengli: but if you want to profit from newest rakudo, I highly recommend to check out parrot by svn to get the latest

[15:37] <levengli> perl Configure.pl --parrot-config=/usr/bin/parrot

[15:37] <moritz_> parrot_config, not parrot

[15:37] <levengli> and if i want to put that in /usr/bin

[15:37] <moritz_> you might need the parrot-dev package for that

[15:37] <levengli> perl Configure.pl --parrot-config=/usr/bin/parrot_config --gen-parrot?

[15:37] <levengli> will that work?

[15:38] <levengli> also, why parrot-config and not parrot?

[15:39] <levengli> i mean parrot_config

[15:39] <moritz_> either --parrot-config=  or --gen-parrot

[15:39] <moritz_> the former tells rakudo to use an existing parrot

[15:39] <moritz_> the latter to donwload and install (locally) one

[15:39] <levengli> got it

[15:39] <levengli> can i tell it to download one and install it in /usr/bin?

[15:39] <moritz_> parrot_config because it gives rakudo relevant path

[15:40] <moritz_> s

[15:40] <moritz_> like paths of dynamic libraries etc.

[15:40] <moritz_> levengli: that's possible with some tricks, but it's a bad idea - /usr/bin should be reserved for things installed by the package manager

[15:40] <levengli> ok

[15:41] <levengli> so suppose i want /usr/local/bin

[15:41] <levengli> can i use --parrot_config=/usr/local/bin --gen-parrot? or ar the two options mutually exclusive?

[15:41] <moritz_> they are exclusive

[15:42] <levengli> and you suggest gen-parrot

[15:42] <levengli> i'll take your work

[15:42] <levengli> word

[15:42] <levengli> i assume that this means that perl6 will also be somewhere non-standard

[15:42] <moritz_> aye

[15:43] <moritz_> it will install inside your rakudo dir in parrot_install/bin/perl6

[15:43] <levengli> you're killing me ;)

[15:43] <moritz_> I usually just symlink that to my ~/bin/ dir

[15:43] <levengli> i'm used to csh and am using bash

[15:43] <moritz_> ah, I just see that rakudo's congifure has the --gen-parrot-prefix option

[15:47] <jnthn> afaik, it doesn't...I don't recall seeing anything spec'd on that.

[15:47] <TimToady> nextsame should work with any dispatcher/wrapper

[15:47] <jnthn> It maybe could be made to.

[15:47] <moritz_> levengli: of course you should keep the sources around, and update them from time to time, so you profit from newly implemented features

[15:47] <ash_> yeah, so if you had multi foo(Int); multi foo(Str);  and one wanted to call the other, like nextwith() 

[15:47] <jnthn> Ugh.

[15:47] <ash_> oh, so that does work? 

[15:47] <ash_> or should? 

[15:47] <jnthn> Well, it's not a 5 minute implementation job.

[15:48] <jnthn> It's...tricky.

[15:48] <ash_> thats fine if it doesn't, i was just wondering 

[15:48] <jnthn> Could be made to. I hadn't until a minute ago expected it would need to.

[15:48] <TimToady> imagine that all dispatchers have a loop labelled CANDIDATE, and 'nextsame' basically means "next CANDIDATE"

[15:49] <TimToady> or next VICTIM :)

[15:49] <levengli> are there any modules on CPAN for perl6? is there a way to specify perl6 modules only in the search?

[15:49] <jnthn> No, next VICTIM is for moving through a list of Perl 6 implementors. :-P

[15:49] <moritz_> :-)

[15:49] <TimToady> well, there is that...

[15:50] <ash_> levengli: not currently, there is proto though, its CPAN like for perl 6, eventually CPAN is going to be integrated, but for now they are two separate things  

[15:50] <levengli> where is it to be found/

[15:50] <levengli> ?

[15:51] <moritz_> levengli: http://github.com/masak/proto/ has a projects.list with all known Perl 6 modules

[15:51] <levengli> great

[15:51] <levengli> thanks

[15:51] <ash_> levengli: http://github.com/masak/proto but i think it has issues with the current master, there was a recent refactor of some internal code so some things that used to work are IMA 

[15:51] <ash_> moritz_ types faster than me :P 

[15:51] <ash_> do you still need alpha for proto? or can it be used with master rakudo yet? 

[15:52] <moritz_> no idea

[15:52] <jnthn> ash_: mberends++ probably knows best :-)

[15:52] <jnthn> ash_: I think there's some refactors going on along with fixing it up for master, though.

[15:53] <moritz_> audreyt++ has moved the pugs sources to http://github.com/audreyt/Pugs.hs

[15:53] <moritz_> so I'm going to remove the outdate traces of pugs in the pugs repo

[15:53] <moritz_> (and other stuff that is hopelessly out of date)

[15:53] <ash_> neat, i'll have to follow that, is it going to be actively developed still? or is it just moving it somewhere separate? 

[15:54] <moritz_> if you object, please raise your hand clearly visible within the next 10 minutes

[15:54] <moritz_> ash_: it's not really developed anymore afaict, but audrey does make it compile with newest GHC versions

[15:54] <ash_> got ya, thats still good 

[15:55] <TimToady> I wonder if we should rename the repo...

[15:55] <moritz_> TimToady: yes, but that's another step

[15:55] <TimToady> call it 'pugsly' or some such :)

[15:55] <ash_> lol, its kinda funny that pugs will soon not have pugs in it 

[15:55] <moritz_> you can all think of a new, good name

[15:55] <moritz_> something short for "everything Perl 6"

[15:55] <TimToady> or 'wednesday'

[15:56] <TimToady> or 'fester'

[15:56] <levengli> or p-ugghs

[16:12] <Juerd> Given the experience of the past week, I expect more feather crashes.

[16:12] <moritz_> Juerd: I should write one, yes...

[16:12] <Juerd> I've set the dom0 to reboot automatically 30 seconds after kernel panics

[16:13] <Juerd> So at least I can reboot feather1..3 remotely

[16:13] <moritz_> Juerd: do you happen to know if I can start screen from within cron?

[16:13] <Juerd> Yes, you can

[16:13] <moritz_> cool

[16:13] <Juerd> moritz_: screen -d -m -S $somename $command

[16:14] <moritz_> these commits reduced the size of a pugs svn checkout from 310M to 272M

[16:14] <Juerd> Still very large

[16:14] <moritz_> aye

[16:14] <Juerd> Have you used ncdu on it yet?

[16:14] <moritz_> much of it is compiled bootstrapping files in kp6

[16:15] <moritz_> in my git mirror, v6/v6-KindaPerl6/compiled is 37.5MB

[16:16] <jnthn> And beer sales would rise globally...

[16:17] * jnthn struggles to keep track of all the <prefix>p6 :-)

[16:23] <Juerd> The kernel panics.

[16:23] <Juerd> The message says something about the ahci (sata) controller and xen and lvm, i.e. it's not very specific.

[16:24] <Juerd> Also we can't just downgrade to the version we had running before because the new udev requires a new kernel.

[16:24] <levengli> how does one go about *reading* STD.pm?

[16:25] *** Psyche^ joined
[16:25] <moritz_> levengli: I don't know, I never actually managed to read it through :-)

[16:25] <moritz_> levengli: but in principle reading S05 and S02 helps

[16:26] <Juerd> levengli: I suggest you open it in at least 4 different windows, that you tile.

[16:27] <Juerd> That way you can jump through the document and still keep one main window that you use in a more linear fashion

[16:27] <levengli> i started going through it. it is ambiguous

[16:27] <Juerd> An ambiguous grammar?

[16:30] <levengli> i wanted to see an error message, and now i have ;)

[16:31] <jnthn> levengli: Yes, we still need to get showing the source line number in the errors. One of the Many Many Tasks.

[16:31] <levengli> i am fairly fluent in perl5, wanting to get into the perl6 mess

[16:31] <levengli> what can i do?

[16:33] <jnthn> Depends what your interests and skills are. :-) There's lots of different things to hack on.

[16:33] <levengli> i speak perl5.8 and C

[16:34] <levengli> i'll be happy to hack on anything that doesn't have to be checked in *tomorrow*; since i don't have a lot of time

[16:35] <jnthn> If you're familiar with Perl 5, then a good way to get into Perl 6 is http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-5-to-6/00-intro.html

[16:36] <jnthn> There are *some* C and Perl 5 bits in Rakudo, but we're writing a lot of the built-ins in Perl 6, and lot of other bits in NQP (a small subset of Perl 6).

[16:37] <levengli> so... in order to help i have to know perl6

[16:37] <levengli> correct/

[16:37] <levengli> ?

[16:37] <moritz_> (the same articles can be found on http://perlgeek.de/en/article/5-to-6 but with correct ordering)

[16:37] <moritz_> levengli: yes

[16:37] <jnthn> For some sense of "know" :-)

[17:33] <mathw> heh there was no breakage

[17:34] <mathw> the first guy who tested made a handful of mistakes

[17:34] <mathw> the two from my dojo did awesomely well :)

[17:36] <jnthn> am0c: The code produced by --target=pir at the moment is missing some bits.

[17:41] <am0c> jnthn: I see but which is missing this feature at this moment? parrot or rakudo? or is this by design?

[17:42] <pmurias> mathw: so how does a dan test look like?

[17:43] <mathw> pure awesome :)

[17:44] <mberends> am0c: target=pir cannot be used in conjunction with -e, it's an omission in Rakudo, will probably be added a bit later on. Currently your most usable option is to save your code in a .pm file, compile that to .pir, and use yoour module from a script.

[20:20] <araujo> by the way (bit off-topic) , anyone has a nice recommendation for a laptop to be used for heavy development? (gcc compilation of big packages mainly)

[20:22] <masak> I think the time is ripe to buy a quantum laptop. it still only puts 12 or so qubits in an entangled state, and they're still a bit heavy, but boy are they powerful!

[20:22] <masak> and that quadratic speedup is not to be neglected.

[20:25] <jnthn> On a more conventional note, I've been happy with Thinkpads so far.

[21:54] <spinclad> 'Traget audience':  somehow i'm disinclined to think that a typo  :)

[21:55] <masak> oops. thanks.

[21:55] <masak> will fix.

[21:56] <spinclad> what, that wasn't some sekret word prevent mayhem in austria?

[21:56] <spinclad> *preventing

[21:56] <masak> I'm thinking of adding one.

[21:57] <spinclad> .oO( call for new tactics:  army in Bratislava has moved to Sweden )

[21:58] <masak> Austria reference added. :)

[22:01] <moritz_> good afternoon lambdabutterflies

[23:40] <jnthn> But no, you'd want to juse use <foo> and it'd pick the right one.

[23:41] <arnsholt> Well, I want to match agains only the :sym<a> part of the proto, not the b

[23:41] <arnsholt> =)

[23:42] <jnthn> Probably best to factor it out to a rule of its own, call that and then also call it from the proto.

[23:42] <arnsholt> Yeah, probably. But I had to try =)
