[03:25] <pugs_svn> r29504 | diakopter++ | [sprixel] finished implementing recursive named patterns; tested with right-recursive  

[03:25] <pugs_svn> r29504 | patterns up to 1<<10 invocations deep.  Note that the JS call stack is much

[03:25] <pugs_svn> r29504 | shorter/shallower than that. :)

[03:26] <diakopter> TimToady: the requirement for capturing group indexes to be statically determined isn't possible in recursive patterns

[03:27] <TimToady> recursion counts as a subpattern, not as inlined

[03:28] <diakopter> o

[03:28] <diakopter> o yeah

[03:28] <diakopter> thanks :)

[03:28] <TimToady> any construct that would force a dynamic interpretation on those is forced to be lexical that way

[03:29] <TimToady> if you want a dynamic version, you have to do your own gather/take

[03:29] <diakopter> weeeeeeellllll

[03:29] <diakopter> or something.

[03:38] * diakopter thinks about what to implement next

[03:38] <diakopter> let's see.  todos:  1) named capturing groups: done in sprixel#; easy port (also includes match object).

[03:39] *** ashizawa joined
[03:40] *** Baggiokwok left
[03:41] <diakopter> 2) whole-number indexed capturing groups

[03:42] *** Baggiokwok joined
[03:42] <diakopter> falls out from named capturing groups, mostly, plus (as masak pointed out) each alternation must compute and 'pass upwards' the largest of the minimum slots required by its alternatives.

[03:43] <diakopter> 3) protoregexes: done in sprixel#; easy port

[03:45] <diakopter> would anyone like to vote on which to do next?

[03:48] <diakopter> ok, #1 it is

[03:54] <diakopter> actually, counted (exact or by range) repetitions should be next.

[04:02] *** Baggiokwok left
[04:03] *** Baggiokwok joined

[06:16] <diakopter> no; I'm refactoring majorly atm; thank you though :D

[06:16] <diakopter> doing repetition *the right way* now

[06:20] <diakopter> many manies

[06:20] <mberends> yes, I remember the previous Sprixel :)

[06:20] <mberends> although Everything Is A String initially, there need to be hooks for other data types later on

[06:30] <mberends> there's always the prior art in Parrot to learn from ;)

[06:57] <mberends> since concatenating is a frequent and potentially expensive operation, LLVM recommends replacing your String with a Rope made of Twines (lazy concatenation). nice. easier done at compile time than run time, however.

[07:15] <cognominal> I thought parrot was using ropes?

[07:17] <mberends> don't know. the intent was to reduce heap thrashing, and quite a few parrot problems are heap related (GC etc)

[07:18] <mberends> in the case of vill, it would be premature optimization. good to note though.

[07:20] <diakopter> imho, proper design/exploration/refactoring is often mistaken for premature optimization (and it indicates a not-thoroughly-understood problem).

[07:21] <diakopter> (in other words, proper design/exploration/refactoring is done for the purpose of thoroughly understanding the problem)

[07:22] <mberends> well that does need consideration with something like String implementation, because omitting a Rope API would imply much more rewriting later on. where is that crystal ball?

[07:23] <diakopter> i dunno. I think I saw it flying south.

[07:23] <mberends> diakopter: please lend me your crystal ball, mine seems to have rolled away

[07:23] <diakopter> heh

[07:24] <diakopter> the one I was using floated away and flew south for the winter.  a long, dark winter.

[07:25] <mberends> hmm

[07:27] <diakopter> debugging generated code without a debugger is... fraught with frustration.

[07:27] <mberends> yes. sometimes only print is your friend.

[07:28] <diakopter> perhaps I should use a debugger.  Alls Is needs tos dos is make it output to a file that's included in a .html page, and run it in IE.

[07:28] * diakopter often slower than the average bear.

[07:30] <mberends> (the next Perl 6 implementation will be developed and based on Internet Explorer) (!)

[07:31] <mberends> and NotePad++

[07:31] <diakopter> IE's debugger is the best/fastest available (still). firefox', chrome's, and safari's are still laggy/flaky.

[10:45] <Su-Shee> yours.

[10:45] <Su-Shee> saschi: I slaved 45 minutes alone over the stove to brown the beef properly.

[10:49] <saschi> Su-Shee: my one needed app. 90-120 minutes, i guess

[10:50] <saschi> Su-Shee: i switched between computer & wine and stove & wine

[10:54] <Su-Shee> I took the notebook with me in the kitchen. why do we have wlan nowadays? ;)

[10:55] <Su-Shee> mine took 2hrs 30 min to get ready, but the preparation was rather long.

[10:55] <saschi> Su-Shee: to brown onions, stewing the beef and then the simmering process with wine and spicery took time

[10:55] <saschi> Su-Shee: that true ^^

[10:56] <Su-Shee> I skipped the onions and went for the mushrooms. :)

[10:56] <saschi> Su-Shee: i started arround 7 PM and the supper was ready for serving arround 9 PM

[10:56] <saschi> ah, ok :D

[10:57] <saschi> i used carrots as "spicery" too

[10:58] <Su-Shee> well I also made a fresh bread and an apricot tarte as dessert.. ;)

[10:58] <Su-Shee> (still feeling exhausted ;)

[10:58] <saschi> but they got lost in the sieve through which i passed the sauce through

[10:59] <Su-Shee> mine was way too creamy to pass through anything.

[10:59] <Su-Shee> thick, concentrated, aroma-laden.. :)

[11:00] <saschi> so i needed to prepare some extra and placed them with the beef in the bonded (?) sauce ^^

[11:16] <saschi> Su-Shee: yeah, she has american and english cook books, but i never looked for the authors names

[11:17] <saschi> Su-Shee: i heard the first time about "The Art of French Cooking" and Julia Childs yesterday ;)

[11:18] <Su-Shee> don't forget the art of war and the art of sql ;)

[11:18] <saschi> and according to my personal experiences so called "french cooking" is the most solide teqnique to get yummy results IMHO

[17:29] <diakopter> what's wrong with comparing across categories?

[17:30] <slavik> it's like comparing apples and oranges :P

[17:30] <diakopter> right, what's wrong with comparing apples and oranges?

[17:30] <diakopter> they're substitutes for one another at many level.s

[17:30] <diakopter> levels.

[17:31] <slavik> C# - compiled and serverside, Javascript - not really compiled and clientside

[17:31] <diakopter> as projectiles, as food, as teaching tools

[17:31] <slavik> haha

[17:31] <diakopter> C# - JIT compiled and serverside/clientside, JavaScript - JIT compiled and serverside/clientside

[17:32] <diakopter> C# is JIT compiled to machine code when invoked.  same with JavaScript.

[17:32] <diakopter> better stated, CIL (what C# is translated to) is JIT compiled to machine code...

[17:33] <diakopter> all of the JS engines other than IE's have standalone/command-line editions.

[17:34] <diakopter> C# is generated/used on the clientside quite often (in silverlight apps).

[17:34] <diakopter> JavaScript is used on the serverside too.

[17:34] <slavik> silverlite is closer to flash though than javascript

[17:34] <diakopter> flash's actionscript *is* javascript.

[17:34] <diakopter> mostly.

[17:35] <slavik> right

[17:35] <slavik> no wait

[17:35] <slavik> no it's not ... how is actionscript javascript?

[17:36] <slavik> hmm, I see

[17:36] <slavik> based on ecma script

[17:36] <slavik> so they are both based on ecma script ...

[17:36] <slavik> arrg, you win

[17:36] <slavik> in that case, javascript can be nicer, since it's not statically typed ... but limited

[17:37] <slavik> so it still sucks, that's why I use Perl. :D

[17:37] <diakopter> well, ecmascript was the standard derived from the javascript implementations.  however, a good compiler can infer the types.

[17:37] <diakopter> it's limited?

[17:37] <slavik> diakopter: in a way that IE can infer array(1) to be the same as array[1] ?

[17:38] <slavik> let me rephrase that. I find it limiting :)

[17:38] <slavik> no proper hashes and coercing objects to be hashes is a hack IMO

[17:39] <diakopter> someone could turn that around to say: no proper object and coercing hashes to be objects is a hack IMO

[17:42] <diakopter> array(1) in IE does what?

[17:44] <diakopter> IE doesn't infer array(1) to be the same as array[1].

[17:46] <diakopter> (why would it?)

[17:48] <diakopter> I should specify: "however, a good compiler can infer the types, iff the code is written as if it were strongly-typed, just not annotated with the types"

[17:59] <arnsholt> Prototype-based OO is funky

[18:00] <diakopter> "a definitvely hackish"?

[18:00] <pmurias> LS?

[18:00] <pmurias> diakopter: hacked together would be a better word

[18:00] <slavik> diakopter: IE6 does ...

[18:00] <slavik> diakopter: ever hear of a term: IE only web page?

[18:00] <diakopter> slavik: you're being rude... that question doesn't follow from that statement

[18:01] <arnsholt> I'm not sure hacked together is the right way to describe JS OO. I think the problem is that it's so different from class-based OO

[18:01] *** _hugues23_ joined
[18:02] <diakopter> I agree with arnsholt. anything different from what one is accustomed to seems "hackish".

[18:04] <diakopter> slavik: if IE<=6 lets you invoke an array like a function, I didn't know about it. can you point me to a URL where it is described?

[18:04] <pmurias> diakopter: js seems hackish in the sense that i feel js developers were cutting corners

[18:05] *** cognominal left
[18:05] <arnsholt> The thing that annoys me with JS is that statements can be terminated with a newline as well as ;

[18:05] <arnsholt> Which makes the syntax a lot more complicated than it should

[18:07] <slavik> looking for it

[18:10] <pmurias> diakopter: it's different, more verbose and less powerfull and easier to implement

[18:11] <diakopter> pmurias: what is "it" in that statement? perl? js? C#? prototype-based-oo?  class-based-oo?  hash/bless-based-oo?

[18:11] <pmurias> js-oo

[18:12] <pmurias> properly done prototype-oo doesn't seem to be clearly bad

[18:12] <diakopter> I can't think of a way it's less powerful, except that it can't do compile-time multiple-inheritance a la C++

[18:14] <pmurias> it's less powerfull than perls

[18:14] <slavik> hmm, can't find it

[18:21] <diakopter> slavik: I looked too; I can't find it either. later today I'll pull up XP Mode and try it :)

[19:00] <colomon__> afk

[19:05] <mberends> it looks like concatenate( var, literal ) is not the same as concatenate( literal, var )

[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 | diakopter++ | [sprixel] made grammars & their parsers re-entrant, enabling backtracking into a match. 

[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 |  Implemented named capture groups.  Example:

[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 | var g = new Grammar('wp6'); var p = g.addPattern('toplevel', both(plus(dot()),both(group(plus(dot()),"tail"),end())));

[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 | var input = utf32str(Array(4).join('a')); var m = g.parse(input);

[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 | print(m.match.c["tail"].s); m = m.next(); print(m.match.c["tail"].s);

[22:29] *** iblechbot left
[22:29] <pugs_svn> r29513 | // outputs 1 (newline) 2, as the tail portion of the match is backtracked.

[22:30] <diakopter> er, I mean, outputs 2 (newline) 1

[22:31] <diakopter> sry for using 're-entrant' imprecisely
