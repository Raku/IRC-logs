[01:14] <lue> hello!

[01:17] <m-locks> hi

[01:17] <m-locks> why does rakudo complain about use v6; 

[01:17] *** wolf2k_ubuntu joined
[01:18] <m-locks> or am i supposed to use a v6 module on perl5

[01:18] <m-locks> crap

[01:18] <m-locks> i bet i can't find that one ported

[01:18] <TimToady> alpha: use v6;

[01:18] <p6eval> alpha 30e0ed:  ( no output )

[01:18] <TimToady> rakudo: use v6

[01:19] <p6eval> rakudo b9b10e:  ( no output )

[01:19] <m-locks> so somethings up

[01:19] <TimToady> it doesn't complain on my machine

[01:20] <m-locks> i was going to try out some of those modules there

[01:20] <m-locks> that svg-plot for instance

[01:20] <lue> bkeeler: ping

[01:21] <bkeeler> hi there

[01:22] *** hercynium joined
[01:23] <lue> I think I may want to ssh to that server :). Runlevel 3 made no tangible difference (and I just spent a few minutes FIXING the hd after shutting down)

[01:24] <lue> (of course, whenever I shut down normally, I have to fix the hd, but it was more than usual)

[01:25] *** jferrero left
[01:28] <m-locks> hmm

[01:28] <m-locks> "load_bytecode" couldn't find file 'SVG::Plot::Pie.pir'

[01:29] <m-locks> it's supposed to look for .pm i guess

[01:30] *** lestrrat is now known as lest_away

[01:30] <bkeeler> You may need to compile the SVG::Plot::Pie code to pir with perl6 --target=pir

[01:31] <bkeeler> Though obviously use *should* be fine with loading .pm files directly

[01:31] <m-locks> well, gonna try out that --target first, dunno whats wrong there

[01:32] <bkeeler> I guess it just hasn't been implented in master yet

[01:33] <m-locks> well its not working that great either

[01:33] <bkeeler> It looks like use doesn't actually do anything at compile time, it just emits code to run a !use sub in cheats/use.pir

[01:34] <m-locks> ok but how do i supply the module name 

[01:34] <bkeeler> Looks like alpha might be your best bet for playing with that SVG code

[01:35] <lue> Perl6: the only language to admit it cheats :)

[01:35] <bkeeler> Though like I said, you should be able to './perl6 --target=pir file.pm > file.pir' or similar to compile it manually

[01:36] <bkeeler> Well, the idea is that the cheats are temporary hacks which should go away eventually

[01:36] <lue> I know. But still...

[01:36] <m-locks> i guess trying out modules are just temporary hacks then too

[01:38] <m-locks> maybe i'm missing some directory setting or something

[01:39] <lue> (this is great. I'm doing stuff and it's not affecting my computer at all. I'm ecstatic :D)

[01:44] *** mssm left
[01:53] <lue> bkeeler: I am amazed at your server. Must want.

[01:54] <bkeeler> It was a semi-decent server a few years ago, but it does the job

[01:55] <lue> what you call semi-decent I call really fast!

[01:56] <bkeeler> Well, in comparison to G3, yeah heh

[02:16] *** lichtkind left
[02:19] <lue> How would I run changes to the test suite in the pugs repo as opposed to running make spectest in the rakudo repository?

[02:21] *** sbilik left
[02:24] *** ShaneC left
[02:28] <bkeeler>  LIke if you just want to run one test?

[02:29] <colomon> make t/spec/S32-trig/sin.t 

[02:29] <colomon> for example

[02:29] <bkeeler> Yep, what he said

[02:29] <bkeeler> That takes care of fudging too if need be

[02:29] <bkeeler> OK, food time.  Back later....

[02:30] <lue> alright. I really don't want to call make spectest every time I change a test :)

[02:32] <colomon> you can also run it directly -- ./perl6 t/spec/S32-trig/sin.rakudo   to get the fudged version, for instance.

[02:32] <colomon> but I prefer using the make form except for special cases (like running in the debugger).

[02:33] *** eternaleye left
[02:34] <lue> It says `nothing to be done for [filename here]' :/

[02:35] <colomon> did you say make blah/.rakudo ?

[02:35] <colomon> that doesn't work.  make always has to be blah/.t

[02:35] <TimToady> I think that's abuse of make

[02:36] * colomon is an abuser.

[02:36] <lue> then what should I do !?

[02:37] *** PhilKenSebben joined
[02:37] <colomon> ignore TimToady and use make.

[02:37] <lue> (I did use .t btw)

[02:38] <colomon> can you post what you typed and what it said back?

[02:38] <colomon> (paste if it is very long?)

[02:38] <lue>  make t/spec/S32-trig/sin.t (this gave me:)

[02:38] <lue> make: Nothing to be done for `t/spec/S32-trig/sin.t'.

[02:39] <colomon> what directory did you run it from?

[02:39] <TimToady> THAT'S A CORRECT RESULT IF IT ALREADY EXISTS!!!!

[02:39] <lue> pugs, the top level

[02:39] <colomon> Oh!

[02:39] <colomon> if you want to test rakudo, you need to do it from the rakudo directory.

[02:40] <lue> :/ I just want to run the tests as I change them... and I'd rather change them in pugs directly

[02:40] <colomon> TimToady: That's not how Rakudo's makefile is set up.

[02:40] <TimToady> and using make that way prevents you from using make to *write* any tests

[02:41] <TimToady> it's just completely bogus

[02:41] <TimToady> it's not design smell, it's design rotten to the core

[02:42] * lue still wants to run tests w/o make spectest ...

[02:42] <TimToady> someday I'll tell you what I really think... :)

[02:44] <lue> would ./perl6 be alright ?

[02:44] * PhilKenSebben laughs "Ha ha haaaaaaaa!"

[02:44] *** PhilKenSebben left
[02:44] <colomon> and maybe writing a new script that does exactly what make blah/test.t does only without using the make structure would be a good test for a wandering newbie.  :)

[02:45] <colomon> lue: yes, but you'll have to fudge fudged tests by hand.

[02:45] <colomon> if you do it that way.

[02:45] <TimToady> fudgeall should work just fine for that

[02:45] <lue> do I HAVE to fudge tests run w/ perl6?

[02:45] <colomon> (And I don't have a clue how to do that.)

[02:46] <colomon> well, you can avoid it if there is no fudging in the test file.

[02:46] <colomon> or if you don't mind it not working.  :)

[02:46] <TimToady> often the test file won't even compile without fudging

[02:46] <lue> Isn't fudging for, when you want the test to work, but you don't mind lieing a little (aka The Politician Method)

[02:48] <TimToady> unlike a politician, it helps to cut down noise

[02:50] <TimToady> basically, it allows you test against some subset language rather than real Perl 6

[02:50] <lue> so, fudging is temporary (also like politicians' lies nowadays)

[02:50] <TimToady> yes, the very fact of fudging is considered a test failure, when it comes to real Perl 6

[02:51] <TimToady> the acid test will be passing all the *.t tests without fudging

[02:51] <TimToady> but fudging is useful for weeding out results you aren't (yet) interested in

[02:52] <lue> alright, I'll have a look at all that when appropos. I'll add myself to the AUTHORS file when I have something to upload.

[03:06] <colomon> pmichaud: BTW, IMO Range.Num should have been implemented more smartly than just creating the iterator and counting it.  That was only ever intended to be a quick way to get .Num working.

[03:08] <colomon> Though of course, it is easily overriden.

[03:13] <lue> util/prove6 seems like a candidate for running tests *coughcough*

[03:15] <colomon> prove6?

[03:16] <lue> idk, it's in the README

[03:17] <colomon> it's in pugs/util

[03:18] <colomon> looks like it is designed for pugs.

[03:19] <lue> Anything in particular that needs to be testable? Or just look in the TODO?

[03:20] <colomon> I'm not sure I follow you?

[03:20] <lue> Anything of critical importance in terms of testing?

[03:22] <colomon> Ah, good places for you to be adding tests, you mean?

[03:23] <lue> yes.

[03:23] * colomon ponders...

[03:23] <lue> I don't want to waste time on an operator in S02 when the whole of S22 is untested :)

[03:23] <TimToady> there's an operator in S02? :)

[03:24] <lue> just an example, not meant to be real :)

[03:24] <colomon> we could use a lot more up-to-date series tests, for example.

[03:24] <lue> (We smile too much) :)

[03:25] <lue> colomon: will look at that. :)

[03:25] <colomon> but that's going to be hard for you, because it's tricky and doesn't work properly yet.

[03:25] <colomon> so that's not an actual example.  :)

[03:25] <TimToady> better too much than too little

[03:25] <colomon> (Hopefully it will be a good target for tests next week...)

[03:26] <colomon> I'm trying to think of areas that shocked me when I looked at them.

[03:26] <lue> I'll just look around, see what isn't there, look in TODO, etc... :)

[03:29] <colomon> rakudo: say 5 min 4

[03:29] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«4␤»

[03:29] <colomon> rakudo: say 4 min 5 min 2

[03:29] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«2␤»

[03:29] <colomon> That's one of the ones I ran into.  I'm not sure there are *any* real tests for that form of min / max.

[03:30] <colomon> either that or I completely missed them somewhere in there.

[03:31] <colomon> There are tests for the meta-reduce form of those operators, but not the regular forms.

[03:32] <lue> rakudo: say 4 min 3 min 5

[03:32] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«3␤»

[03:32] * lue will look at minmax

[03:32] <colomon> though that test itself may not work?  I'll take a look, too....

[03:36] *** quietfanatic left
[03:38] <lue> rakudo: say min(3,4,2)

[03:38] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«invoke() not implemented in class 'Integer'␤current instr.: 'perl6;Any;_block730' pc 256913 (src/gen/core.pir:14638)␤»

[03:39] <colomon> rakudo: say (3,4,2).min

[03:39] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«2␤»

[03:39] <colomon> both forms should work, I think...

[03:40] <colomon> oh, wait.

[03:41] *** mikehh_ joined
[03:41] *** mikehh left
[03:41] <colomon> rakudo: say min({$^a <=> $^b}, 2, 5, 3);

[03:41] <p6eval> rakudo 7c90f1: OUTPUT«2␤»

[03:42] <TimToady> alpha: say [min](3,4,2)

[03:42] <p6eval> alpha 30e0ed: OUTPUT«2␤»

[03:43] *** quietfanatic joined
[03:43] <lue> should min without the [] works as well?

[03:43] <colomon> lue: the sub form of min must take the Ordering argument first.

[03:43] <colomon> so it works like I used it there, but not like you used it.

[03:44] *** mikehh_ left
[03:44] *** mikehh_ joined
[03:45] <TimToady> have to use [min] for the other way

[03:45] <colomon> and [min] doesn't work yet in master.  :(

[03:46] <TimToady> which is why I used alpha...

[03:48] <lue> where would min/max tests be? I don't see them...

[03:48] <colomon> S32-list

[03:49] <colomon> though I guess you might be able to make an argument that the operator form could go in S03 or something.

[03:49] <lue> yeah, .min , .max , and .minmax are defined in S03

[03:51] <colomon> max= is tested in S03-operators/assign.t

[03:52] <lue> waitaminute. In S32-list/minmax.t it tests if @array.min is -3, when the lowest element in that list is -9 !

[03:52] <colomon> what line?

[03:53] <colomon> (and I'm trying to get that test file fudged enough to run right now.  :)

[04:01] <TimToady> so, as an example

[04:02] <TimToady> instead of having $a and $b as special inside sort, we have placeholder arguments that can be used anywhere

[04:02] <TimToady> and sort {$^a <=> $^b} falls out naturally from that

[05:40] <lue> the hell... ō.–. Methinks noone's reading the spec. Three P6 implementations, three results, all different from what minmax.t says.

[05:42] <pmichaud> colomon: (Range.Num)  -- sure, if you have a smarter mechanism for computing the range, then the class can override it.  My intent is that if you have an Iterable (and don't know much else about it), then the calculation for .Num is to count the iterations.  :-)

[05:42] <TimToady> minmax should probably be redefined in terms of Range objects

[05:42] * lue will blotch out those tests until further notice...

[05:43] *** gfx joined
[05:44] <lue> TimToady: you see the problem? Three implementations giving three results, none matching what was set in minmax.t! *pull hair*

[05:45] <pmichaud> lue: that's why we have a set of standard tests :)

[05:46] <lue> yes. Where's the info in the spec when you need it? (Is NaN greater than Inf? How's about 0 vs NaN? argh!)

[05:47] <lue> How can I make ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS skip a test (besides removing it)?

[05:47] <pmichaud> comment it out?

[05:47] <pmichaud> explicitly add a skip(...) call?

[05:47] <lue> I'm looking for the fancy #? skip command, but that'll do.

[05:48] <lue> just surround the offending code in skip( [code] ) ?

[05:48] <pmichaud> no

[05:48] <pmichaud> skip(5, 'reason for skipping 5 tests');

[05:48] <pmichaud> (I might have the args backwards there.)

[05:49] <pmichaud> or, perhaps more likely, todo(...)

[05:49] <lue> for example, there's a #?rakudo 4 skip '[op] NYI' line in their. I just want to make it skip all implementations, not just rakudo

[05:49] <lue> s/their/there/

[05:49] <pmichaud> in this case, using #? is likely incorrect, because the reason for skipping the tests has to do with the fact that the tests are wrong, not because any implementations have difficulty with them.

[05:50] <lue> so, just comment it out, and change the # of planned tests?

[05:50] <pmichaud> that's what I'd do, yes.

[05:50] <lue> will do.

[05:50] <pmichaud> and in the comment it out, explain why they're commented out.

[05:50] <lue> of course.

[05:51] <lue> The guy before me had rakudo skip the first two of four NaN related ones, but that's not going to help.

[11:57] <dalek> rakudo/master: catch another instance of PObj_active_destroy_SET noticed by quester++

[11:57] <dalek> rakudo/master: review: http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/4071ac33015ff1ca30e5fc15cce0065b4fa13f5e

[12:01] * quester_ Is going to back to git pull.  The make I did with the change vi'ed locally worked fine.

[12:08] <uniejo> A new checkout of master branch now compiles fine.

[12:09] <uniejo> Thanks. moritz++ quester_++

[12:09] <moritz_> uniejo++ for trying it out

[12:10] <quester_> moritz_:  I'm sorry, do you mean that the generated .c files are distributed with a git pull and are also supposed to be regenerated by make...?

[12:10] <moritz_> quester_: no

[12:10] <quester_> uniejo:  You're very welcome.

[12:10] <moritz_> quester_: I changed them locally with a perl -pi -e 's/../../' src/*.pmc src/*.c

[12:11] <moritz_> quester_: and that gave them newer time stamps, so 'make' did not regenerate them

[12:11] <moritz_> quester_: so the (still wrong) .template file did not matter, and my build went to completion

[12:13] <quester_> moritz_:  D'oh.  Of course.  So... a make clean; make would have caught that, but not just a make?  (I'm thinking I'm going to make the same mistake one of these days Real Soon Now.)

[12:14] <moritz_> quester_: right

[12:14] <moritz_> or even a new Configure.pl would have helped

[12:14] <moritz_> that also cleans

[12:15] <quester_> moritz_:  I see.  Thanks again!

[12:16] <quester_> moritz_: BTW, after the git pull both make and make test worked.

[12:16] <moritz_> great

[12:17] <colomon> phenny: tell lue Looks like you did a nice job on minmax.t.  lue++

[12:17] <phenny> colomon: I'll pass that on when lue is around.

[12:18] <quester_> moritz:  It's been fun, and educational.  Good localtime; I'm off to bed now.

[12:56] <ruoso> pmichaud, re your iterable commit -- note that evaluating the number of elements in an iterable might require early evaluation of its sub-iterators...

[12:58] <ruoso> so maybe the iterable should be allowed to return a NotYetEvaluated failure when asked for the number of elements... 

[12:58] <ruoso> and you have a special way to force the early evaluation if necessary

[13:54] <ruoso> TimToady, After yesterday's argument on datetime, I think I came to the conclusion that providing a coercion from Instant to Numeric is just as misleading as it would be providing a coercion from Str to an utf8 buf automatically...

[14:07] <masak> re the names on http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?rakudo_star -- I think 'Rakudo star' should have a capital 'S'; and I've never actually heard the name 'Rakudo Whatever'.

[14:07] <masak> I'm a big fan of the description 'pivotal release'. it captures perfectly what it is.

[14:08] *** stepnem joined
[14:08] <masak> it's "Lisbon" in English.

[14:09] <masak> also, the final quote doesn't really provide an excellent example of what the earlier part of the paragraph talks about.

[14:09] <m-locks> aye

[14:10] <masak> the proper term for 'almost quote' is 'paraphrase'.

[14:10] <m-locks> masak: proto didn't build, small changes needed to be made in Install.pm

[14:11] <masak> m-locks: trying to build it on alpha or Rakudo master?

[14:11] <m-locks> master i guess

[14:11] <m-locks> or from that git

[14:11] <m-locks> s/has Ecosystem/has ::Ecosystem/ and s/undef/*.notdef

[14:11] <m-locks> then it works :)

[14:12] <masak> m-locks: I think you're the first to attempt that. :)

[14:12] <masak> but if those are the only changes required. I'd guess you're on alpha after all...

[14:12] <m-locks> but it started to build perl6 even if i had existing perl6 installed in the dir already

[14:13] <masak> yes.

[14:13] <m-locks> so i kinda never made to the end

[14:13] <masak> I don't know exactly what you mean by that.

[14:13] <m-locks> i hit ctrl-c cos i didn't want to build perl6 again, cos i already ahd built it in the dir 

[14:14] <masak> 'in the dir'?

[14:14] <m-locks> the dir in config.proto

[14:14] <m-locks> that says here it is supposed to be

[14:14] <masak> oh, I see.

[14:14] <masak> yeah, it shouldn't do that.

[14:14] <masak> consider filing a bug report to the github issue tracker about that.

[14:14] <m-locks> i shall look into it

[14:15] <masak> we really shouldn't be caring about installing perl6 at all anymore if we find it installed globally.

[14:15] <masak> proto is a bit behind the times in that way.

[14:15] <m-locks> i see

[14:19] <masak> m-locks: I'm backlogging right now. I see you're checking out a number of Perl 6 projects.

[14:19] *** k23z__ joined
[14:20] *** clintongormley left
[14:20] <masak> m-locks: just be aware that all of those have been written for Rakudo alpha, and (as far as I know) none of them has been rebased to work on the new Rakudo master.

[14:20] <m-locks> oh ok

[14:20] <m-locks> it explains the changes required

[14:20] <masak> in other words, if you're testing things with the aim of getting things to work, you'll be a great lot happier with Rakudo alpha than with Rakudo master right now. :)

[14:20] <masak> which brings me to today's little project.

[14:21] <masak> I'm planning to set up a nightly build of November, Form.pm and Druid.

[14:22] <masak> build them on alpha, run the tests, and report successes and failures in a cute HTML table.

[14:22] <masak> ditto Rakudo master in a table next to it.

[14:22] <masak> the goal being that the 'master' table should be 100% green by the March Rakudo release.

[14:23] *** hanekomu joined
[14:23] <m-locks> is that git clone of rakudo an alpha release?

[14:23] <masak> which git clone?

[14:23] <masak> the one that proto makes?

[14:24] <masak> by the way, I use the term 'alpha' here to refer to 'the old development branch of Rakudo, the one that was actively developed between 2006 and January 2010'.

[14:25] <m-locks> oh ok

[14:25] <masak> alpha: say "Here I am! I'm old!"

[14:25] <p6eval> alpha 30e0ed: OUTPUT«Here I am! I'm old!␤»

[14:25] <m-locks> so i guess it is the master then

[14:25] <masak> yes.

[14:25] <m-locks> that i dug up

[14:25] <m-locks> yes, all fine and good

[14:25] <masak> it's master that's eventually going to become Rakudo Star.

[14:25] <m-locks> i hear ya :)

[14:25] <k23z__> has anyone here tried solving the rubik's cube with A* ? is it feasible ?

[14:26] <masak> k23z__: hah, I actually tried that many many years ago.

[14:26] <masak> k23z__: I ran out of hard drive space. :P

[15:16] <m-locks> so no pugs for me 

[15:17] <PerlJam> for what do you need pugs if you have rakudo?  :)

[15:18] *** crazed left
[15:18] *** crazed joined
[15:19] <m-locks> pugs svn had all the synopsis and other documentation which was nice to get

[15:19] <m-locks> rakudo does not provide such documentation

[15:20] <m-locks> at least i was unable to find any specs

[15:20] <m-locks> the tests are good pieces of code, though

[15:20] <PerlJam> Hmm.  Interesting observation.

[15:21] <PerlJam> Should Rakudo (or Rakudo *) bundle the Synopses as part of the distribution?

[15:21] <m-locks> i would say yes

[15:21] <PerlJam> Certainly yes for Rakudo *

[15:21] <PerlJam> (IMHO)

[15:21] <m-locks> it would need a doc browser though

[15:21] <pmurias> m-locks: you can checkout the synopsis from the pugs repo without installing haskell

[15:22] <m-locks> well yes, but i needed to download them, my internet access is limited from time to time

[15:22] *** charsbar left

[15:23] <pmurias> you need to install Rakudo too

[15:23] <m-locks> that i have done yes :)

[15:23] <pmurias> meant download

[15:24] <pmurias> you are aware of perlcabal.org/syn

[15:24] <pmurias> ?

[15:24] <m-locks> yes, but as i said my internet access is limited

[15:25] <pmurias> limited?

[15:25] <m-locks> it's on and off

[15:31] <masak> m-locks: I'd recommend doing a checkout of http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec

[15:32] <masak> m-locks: I use git-svn for that, but SVN is fine too if you don't plan to write a lot to the spec. :)

[15:33] <Su-Shee> plans for rakudo * are still april, yes?

[15:33] <m-locks> yes, but that's non-wgettable

[15:34] <m-locks> because of robots.txt

[15:34] <masak> m-locks: it requires an SVN client.

[15:34] <m-locks> oh ok, i can svn just the perl6 spec?

[15:34] <masak> Su-Shee: yes, but not necessarily the April release, IIU pmichaud C.

[15:34] <PerlJam> m-locks: yep

[15:34] <masak> m-locks: yes, that was my point. (and PerlJam's)

[15:35] <m-locks> check, i was new to svn

[15:35] <rgrau> is there any doc browser on the way? u4x?

[15:35] <Su-Shee> and is there a place where I can follow something like DBI6?

[15:35] *** hanekomu left
[15:36] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: no one is writing DBI for perl 6 that I know of.

[15:36] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: there has been some work with SQLite and such though

[15:36] <masak> rgrau: I have half-baked plans for u4x. as a part of keeping the effort honest/visible, one of the first things I'll do is probably HTML serialization, so that one can browse the u4x documentation online.

[15:36] *** mberends joined
[15:36] * jnthn is back

[15:36] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: and someone (simon?) looked at getting DBDI working with Rakudo

[15:36] <masak> rgrau: but right now, each time I think of u4x, I realize that that time should go into the Perl 6 Book, which has a tighter schedule.

[15:37] <jnthn> omg book1

[15:37] * jnthn needs to give tuits to that.

[15:37] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: didn't someone say a couple of months ago that dbi6 will be modeled after jdbc and stuff? 

[15:37] <m-locks> what happened to that doing java2perl6 on some java DB* 

[15:37] <mberends> oh hai masak, jnthn, Su-Shee

[15:37] <jnthn> Su-Shee: afaik, that's still The Plan.

[15:37] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: the sqlite stuff I know of, yes.

[15:37] <jnthn> Or at least, it seemed to be last time I tallked to tbunce

[15:38] <Su-Shee> jnthn: hm, i see.

[15:38] <rgrau> masak: yep... I may have some tuits in near future. maybe I could give a try hacking a bit on u4x. I'll let you know if that happens

[15:38] <jnthn> yayitsmberends!

[15:38] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: DBDI is the low-level interface that gets us database drivers,  DBI is built entirely on top of  that (or would be)

[15:38] <Su-Shee> hi mberends :)

[15:38] <jnthn> Su-Shee: well actually...

[15:38] *** ggoebel left
[15:38] <jnthn> Su-Shee: More that the jdbc *driver* interface would be taken.

[15:38] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: and then, of course, things like DBIC woudl be build on top of that  :)

[15:38] <jnthn> Su-Shee: The high-level bits that everyday folks use would be rather more Perly. :-)

[15:38] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: I've just summized "perl 6 database bindings under "DBI6", sorry.

[15:39] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: there's at least 3 levels of play here and I'm not sure anyone is actively working on any of them.

[15:39] <Su-Shee> PerlJam: hm.

[15:42] <jnthn> PerlJam: Spot on.

[15:43] <mberends> jnthn: trying to bring back @*ARGS out of builtins-old/guts.pir into glue/run.pir fails, because the new args pmc does not seem to have a 'list' or an 'Array' method. Any idea where I should look for a solution?

[15:44] <PerlJam> masak: have you been working on the book "off-line"?

[15:45] <masak> PerlJam: does thinking about it count? :)

[15:45] <m-locks> lol

[15:45] <PerlJam> masak: as logn as there some writing in the future before the tentative publication  :)

[15:45] <m-locks> getting there...

[15:45] * PerlJam has been worrying over the book lately.

[15:45] <PerlJam> I've been meaning to write stuff, but Other Things keep coming up

[15:46] <masak> PerlJam: indeed. it's been dormat of late.

[15:46] <masak> PerlJam: same here.

[15:46] <masak> PerlJam: my current plan is to write stuff up as Rakudo features come back online.

[15:46] <masak> for example, I have the nice poker hand example with enums and subtypes...

[15:46] * masak goes to find the gist...

[15:48] <masak> kinda proud of that.

[15:48] <mberends> m-locks: unfortunately proto does not work with new master, for quite a few reasons

[15:48] <masak> but it's written with old-skool enums. I'd like to get new-skool enums working in Rakudo master, and then write up a chapter on that. :)

[15:49] <PerlJam> masak: yeah, that's nice  (except you found the one with an extra face card ;)

[15:49] <masak> mberends++ # proto tuits

[15:49] <masak> PerlJam: 'an extra face card'?

[15:49] <masak> oh right!

[15:50] <m-locks> mberends: i managed to compile it but didn't try it yet to actually setup any libs

[15:50] <ash_> my nq-nqp parser can now parse most of the test files for nqp without error, now to move onto node building so i can walk the node's to build the code

[15:50] * masak should fix that

[15:50] <masak> so, 'jack' is the correct name for 11, right?

[15:50] * mberends plans to hijack jnthn++ next week to make proto work again

[15:51] <PerlJam> masak: yes.

[15:51] <PerlJam> masak: (though "knight" works for me in lieu of "jack" too)

[15:51] <masak> PerlJam: fixed.

[15:51] <mberends> m-locks: it won't work, because for example it cannot read the PERL6LIB environment variable yet

[15:52] <m-locks> ok, what about tweaking it to use config.proto

[15:53] <jnthn> mberends: Yes, we can hack on proto things. :-)

[15:53] <jnthn> mberends: That would be cool. :-)

[15:53] <masak> \o/

[15:54] <jnthn> morning, pmichaud 

[15:54] <mberends> m-locks: that will be a fallback strategy for working around anything that alpha has, that we cannot put into master. But initially proto can be used as a medium size test case of everythingg that master *should* be able to do.

[15:54] <m-locks> env variables are so last millenium

[15:54] <jnthn> masak: On book, for me a lot of it is that Rakudo itself has been in need of Epci Attention of late.

[15:55] <jnthn> mberends: (@*ARGS) maybe make a Parcel and .Seq it.

[15:55] <jnthn> oh, wait, is @*ARGS meant to be mutable, I wonder

[15:55] <masak> jnthn: yes. understandable, and predictable. (or we should have predicted it, at least.)

[15:55] <m-locks> mberends: aye, it seems nice if it works

[15:55] <jnthn> masak: Well, I sort of did and din't.

[15:55] <mberends> jnthn: thanks, that's just the sort of thing I can investigate during de-commute()

[15:56] <masak> jnthn: it's nice if @*ARGS is mutable. then one can shift things off it.

[15:56] <jnthn> mberends: OK, what masak++ said. I reckon on maybe just taking the PMC array and trying like

[15:56] <jnthn> $P0 = new ['Array']

[15:56] <jnthn> $P0.'!STORE'(the_rpa)

[15:56] <jnthn> Or some wuch

[15:58] <jnthn> I parsed your twit up until that word :-)

[15:58] <masak> jnthn: 'laughing'.

[15:59] <jnthn> ah. :-)

[15:59] <masak> it's a gerund in this case, I'd guess.

[16:10] <Tene> I guess I could have asked, but it never occured to me.

[16:11] <Tene> Yeah. :)

[16:11] <masak> I like that about IRC.

[16:11] <masak> apart from the waketimes (and sometimes not even from that), you can't tell where people are from. and it doesn't matter much either.

[16:11] * jnthn never made it to Uppsala yet. Maybe I have to visit and distract masak++ from bug filing for a bit :-)

[16:12] <m-locks> haha

[16:13] <masak> pmichaud: yes. I've really streamlined the process by now.

[16:13] <masak> pmichaud: you said during a talk that you suspected that I have a script for filing bugs. that's not exactly true. I *am* a script for filing bugs. :P

[16:14] <Tene> masak: any process that doesn't have an IRC bot can still be further streamlined.

[16:14] <pmichaud> Tene: masak is also an IRC bot :)

[16:14] * masak makes happy circling motions in the air

[16:15] * TimToady is a Usenet bot that got out of hand

[16:15] <Tene> I was an IRC bot for a while, but then I met people IRL.

[16:16] <Tene> pmichaud: around what time of year might the hypothetical west-coast hackathon happen?

[16:16] <masak> that sounds like a false dichotomy to me :)

[16:16] <pmichaud> Tene: I'm open for suggestions

[16:16] <pmichaud> I had been hoping to do it pre-Rakudo *, but my schedule is rapidly filling up :-(

[16:17] <pmichaud> anyway, my guess is that it'll likely be May timeframe; otherwise we're looking at July/OSCON sort of thing I guess

[16:18] <pmichaud> there's a small possibility that I'll be in California for an extended period of time in the next couple of months, however.

[16:18] <Tene> If things go well, I'm probably moving to CA during March.

[16:18] <TimToady> any of you are always welcome at our house

[16:18] <jnthn> masak: Man, you make a visit sound most challenging.

[16:18] <pmichaud> TimToady: thanks -- very possible I'll take you up on that :)

[16:18] <m-locks> west-coast hackathon sounds epic

[16:19] * Tene shows up at TT's at 4AM

[16:19] <jnthn> pmichaud: fwiw, if it's more July-ish and there's funding, there's a chance I can make it.

[16:19] <pmichaud> jnthn: that would be OSCON, then.  And any funding would likely be used to get me to OSCON in that case :)

[16:19] <pmichaud> jnthn: but I'll see if we can get you there also

[16:19] <pmichaud> that would be awesome

[16:19] <jnthn> pmichaud: OK, well, don't plan around me too much.

[16:20] <masak> jnthn: if you come here, you can admire my Japanese table (the only piece of furniture in my room).

[16:20] <jnthn> pmichaud: But it's more likely I can make something in June/July than in May.

[16:20] <jnthn> masak: Minimalism win. :-)

[16:20] <pmichaud> jnthn: okay.  between German Perl Workshop and YAPC::NA, June is somewhat booked already

[16:20] <jnthn> pmichaud: ah, ok

[16:20] <pmichaud> (and YAPC::NA won't be "west coast" :-)

[16:21] <jnthn> nod

[16:21] <masak> jnthn: it's funny. I looked at all my furniture in 2003, and then I threw it out. haven't looked back since.

[16:23] <masak> jnthn: now, a floor on the other hand, that's a versatile thing. you can use it for paperwork, hosting guests, or ballroom dancing :)

[16:23] <jnthn> You make a good point :-)

[16:29] <masak> Tene: mattress.

[16:29] <masak> the bed was actually the first piece of furniture I threw out. it was awful.

[16:30] <masak> nowadays, it feels slightly odd to sleep in beds, when I'm a guest at other people's.

[16:30] <Tene> That's what I did at my last place.  My bed now is a set of drawers with a mattress on top.

[16:30] <Tene> (I'm really low on space in my current apt.)

[16:31] <m-locks> my bed is a stack of 3 mattresses on top of each other

[16:31] <PerlJam> Hammocks make nice "beds"  :)

[16:49] <jnthn> masak: Oh?

[16:49] <masak> Squerl!

[16:49] <masak> come on, people, keep up :)

[16:49] <jnthn> Oh.

[16:49] <frettled> masak: I think some of us went «oooh, yay!» when we saw it, though.

[16:49] * jnthn remembers that name

[16:50] * PerlJam doesn't remember squerl at all

[16:50] <masak> it's in Web.pm. it's seriously undertested.

[16:50] <m-locks> we need that 6PAN already...

[16:50] <masak> I'd be very happy to see people pick it up.

[16:50] <Tene> masak: but it's not *called* Dee Bee Eye, so it doesn't count.

[16:50] * TimToady perhaps you should find a good tester

[16:50] <m-locks> masak: is it documented?

[16:50] <Achilles333> perlJam: I am interested in coding, documentation and organizing/cleaning things

[16:50] <m-locks> documentation would rule...

[16:50] <masak> m-locks: only in blog posts :/

[16:50] <masak> m-locks: shall I dig them up for you?

[16:50] <m-locks> so here we go!

[16:51] <m-locks> masak: please :)

[16:51] * masak does so

[16:51] <m-locks> Achilles333 could rip all blog documentation and compile them into module documentation files

[16:51] <m-locks> specifying which sub and method did what

[16:51] <frettled> And test Squerl and look at MySQL and PostgreSQL implementations?  :D

[16:51] <PerlJam> or work on u4x

[16:52] <m-locks> u4x mos def

[16:52] <Achilles333> m-locks: Ok. give me more pointers to acheive to do that

[16:52] <Tene> Achilles333: for whatever you do, you'll probably want to start by downloading and compiling Rakudo.

[16:52] <PerlJam> Achilles333: what Tene said

[16:53] <Tene> http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo

[16:53] * PerlJam just realized that he has a latent small negative bias towards the name Achilles that comes from reading too much Orson Scott Card

[16:53] <masak> m-locks: http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39686 and then http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39894

[16:53] <m-locks> thx m8

[16:54] * TimToady sentences PerlJam to reading GEB

[16:54] <masak> seconded.

[16:54] <TimToady> not that Achilles comes off terribly well there either...

[16:54] <Tene> I need to finish GEB someday.  I got distracted after the first half or so and haven't gotten around to finishing it.

[16:54] <TimToady> but better than the Illiad...

[16:54] <masak> frettled: Squerl is at least made to support many SQL implementations. that's part of the beauty of Suquel, its port-parent.

[16:55] <m-locks> btw does that november wiki support SQL

[16:55] <masak> m-locks: no.

[16:55] <m-locks> ok

[16:55] <masak> but if Squerl becomes mature enough, then sure...

[16:55] <Tene> Achilles333: the spec tests are available over svn at http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/spec/

[16:56] <frettled> masak: port-parent, me like

[16:56] <PerlJam> If I hadn't just read "Ender in Exile" a couple of weeks ago, I probably wouldn't have the bias.  It's activation energy would have been far to low to register

[16:56] <Achilles333> Tene: Ok. Downloading Rakudoooo....

[16:57] <m-locks> how to get squerl? or is it embedded in some module

[16:57] <frettled> Mumble, looks like I won't make it to YAPC::NA this summer, too much goings-on.  Maybe I'll try for OSCON instead.

[17:01] <TimToady> radar shows a big storm hitting us just now, should start raining any minute now

[17:01] <frettled> Yay.

[17:01] <frettled> Well, today has been a positively _balmy_ -7 °C on the riverside, so I'm quite happy.

[17:45] <TimToady> use of .arity is a Bad Smell, except perhaps for implementing infix:<...>

[17:47] <PerlJam> I think it fits well for use in .sort

[17:47] <TimToady> yes, there too, but not for anything map-like

[17:47] <jnthn> PerlJam: &multisub.candidates

[17:49] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[17:49] *** azawawi joined
[17:49] <azawawi> hi

[17:50] <PerlJam> how would I say (for sorting), "use this one particular multi"?   like now we can say things like @a.sort(&foo), would I have to say something like  @a.sort(&foo($,$)) ?

[17:50] <PerlJam> assuming foo is a multi

[17:50] <jnthn> There is some NYI syntax for that, I forget exactly how it looks.

[17:50] *** cdarroch left
[17:50] <jnthn> Maybe &foo<Any,Any> or some such.

[17:52] <PerlJam> candidates are only distinguished by type?  i.e.  multi sub foo ($a is ro, $b) { }; multi sub foo ($a is rw, $b) { }  are indistinguishable and triggers an exception ?

[17:53] <jnthn> btw, s/ro/readonly/ and it's default anyway

[17:53] <jnthn> rw should be a bit tighter

[17:54] <jnthn> Actually, given I've refactored the binder, that may be implementable.

[17:54] <jnthn> Quite easily.

[17:54] *** alester left
[17:55] <jnthn> (If anyone wants to play, it's probably just a couple of lines in Perl6MultiSub to tweak the sub that compares the narrowness of two candidates.)

[17:56] <pugssvn> r29807 | azawawi++ | [Cursor] The syml folder is now created properly inside the temp directory 

[17:56] <PerlJam> "is rw" is considerent a constraint?

[17:57] <jnthn> Yeah

[17:57] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[17:57] <masak> kinda makes sense.

[17:57] <jnthn> I was planning to just consider it one.

[17:58] <jnthn> The other thing that needs doing in that bit of code (also easy) is that for multi foo(|$c (Int $a, Int $b)) we need to promote the nested signature into the one that the multi-dispatcher cares about.

[17:58] <PerlJam> then, according to the spec, tie-breaking is handled by declaration order

[17:58] <jnthn> PerlJam: Right.

[17:58] *** dakkar left
[17:58] <jnthn> PerlJam: But "has a constraint" is always tighter than "no constraint"

[17:59] <jnthn> And is readonly = not a constraint.

[17:59] <jnthn> It's just the default

[17:59] <jnthn> So :($x is rw) will always sort into a tigheter narrowness level than :($x)

[18:00] <jnthn> The only time you'll hit the declaration order fun is if you have a

[18:00] <jnthn> :($x is rw) and a :($x where 42)

[18:11] <m-locks> music works too, but sometimes just all quiet and still is needed

[18:12] <masak> azawawi: oh hai! how's life?

[18:12] <PerlJam> going off-line is the easy thing, but still I find myself distracted.

[18:12] <vorner> some people say a girlfriend helps too, but I have varying results there

[18:12] <PerlJam> It's like I have ADD or something.  (I don't know that that's clinically the case though)

[18:12] <PerlJam> vorner: I have a wife and 4 kids.  I don't think I need a girlfriend too  ;)

[18:14] <masak> or was it a commas-before-adverbs-optional rule?

[18:15] <PerlJam> masak: I'm sure TimToady knows :)

[18:15] <masak> PerlJam: yes, but I was hoping someone who's here would remember :)

[18:15] <jnthn> PerlJam: I found that accepting that there just was going to be times when I couldn't focus, and actually stepping away from things to relax/mess around rather than trying to do stuff and failing, kinda helped when me focus more when I did come to do stuff.

[18:15] <PerlJam> I think it's another one of those two-terms kind of things, but I don't remember at all

[18:15] <masak> PerlJam: yes, it certainly is. nowadays.

[18:16] <masak> PerlJam: but it wasn't always.

[18:16] <Tene> PerlJam: what really helps for me is formalizing my "working time" and "non-working time".  For me personally, it was "Put on headphones, play specific music, sit in a specific place, now I'm working", and I would only do those things when I was trying to focus, and stop as soon as I was doing something else.

[18:16] <PerlJam> jnthn: That's the one thing I've come to realize and sometime do  (though there's a tendency for me to keep  trying despite any discernable progress)

[18:17] <PerlJam> Tene: you know what?  I think that may be part of my problem.  I've trained myself to be distracted in certain places rather than the other way around.

[18:18] <Tene> PerlJam: one other thing that helps for me is to start with a list of one item, "Enumerate tasks in detail", then break it out into "enumerate the steps in Foo, in Bar, etc." and work my way down from there.

[18:18] <Tene> Yes, I've definitely done that before. :)

[18:19] <PerlJam> specifically, at work, I tend to get interrupted alot, so rather than "fix" that, I've got it in my head that "at worked you will always be distracted"

[18:19] <PerlJam> s/worked/work/

[18:21] <Tene> PerlJam: I have a wife and 0 kids, so I have plenty of excess distraction to spend on my girlfriend. ;)

[18:22] <PerlJam> Tene: I hope your wife doesn't get on the net much or she's okay with that arrangement :)

[18:24] <Tene> For a while, tea was my "Okay now I'm really focusing" signal.

[18:24] <Tene> I know I've used a few others...

[18:24] <Tene> Yes, the latter.

[19:54] <ruoso> TimToady, just another note... Durations can also be culturally aware... "1 day" is a valid gregorian duration...

[19:55] <ruoso> and is not well defined in terms of seconds

[19:55] <ruoso> it is certainly more reasonable for them to be able to be coerced to the number of seconds

[19:56] <ruoso> but when you add "1 day" it behaves differently then "86400 seconds"

[19:59] *** alester joined
[19:59] <TimToady>  that is not a Duration

[20:01] <TimToady> and 86400 POSIX seconds is not a Duration either :)

[20:04] <TimToady> and you cannot coerce 1 day to a number of seconds without knowing which day you're talking about

[20:05] <TimToady> we will only use the basic Duration type to discuss atomic seconds in Perl 6

[20:06] <TimToady> it is more accurate to say that cultural units can have varying durations, but durations are not aware of culture

[20:07] <TimToady> (unless you have a relativistic culture... :)

[20:07] <ruoso> so what "1 day" is?

[20:09] <ruoso> in perl5 DateTime familiy... it's a DateTime::Duration

[20:09] *** athenot left
[20:10] *** frettled sets mode: +o ruoso

[20:11] <frettled> «1 day» is a problem, yes.

[20:12] <frettled> DST implies that it can be one hour shorter or longer than the norm, leap seconds can make it one or more seconds longer.

[20:12] *** eternaleye joined
[20:13] <frettled> Then we have those fscked-up decisions when governments change time zones.

[20:14] <frettled> When I proposed looking at TAI for the time specification, I believe we were perusing a document about this nice soup.  Hmm.

[20:14] <frettled> Of course, that was probably on IRC…

[20:15] <frettled> I don't even recall if I specifically suggested TAI or something else, heh.

[20:15] <TimToady> "1 day" is a cultural/spacetime-dependendent algorithm for deriving one instant that is approximately 24 hours from another instant, that's all

[20:16] <TimToady> without knowing the culture, the space, or the time, you don't know the duration

[20:17] *** rv2733 joined
[20:17] <frettled> This was one of the links: http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/utc/leapsecond.html

[20:18] <ruoso> TimToady, I meant: what type is "1 day", since it's not an Instant and not a Duration?

[20:18] <TimToady> maybe we should call them Durances, as in "durance vile"

[20:19] <ruoso> heheh...

[20:19] <TimToady> and since durances are usually measured in cultural units

[20:19] <ruoso> but if the Duration is always TAI, why isn't it just a Number?

[20:19] <TimToady> N days/years in jail

[20:19] <frettled> ruoso: I think perhaps considering durations merely as "atomic seconds" would be better.

[20:20] <frettled> that is, when you want that kind of precision

[20:20] <TimToady> because numbers are unitless

[20:20] <TimToady> and we want to keep our dimensional analysis straight

[20:20] <ruoso> so Duration is just a tagged Number

[20:21] <TimToady> yes, like Kilograms

[20:21] *** riffraff left
[20:21] <ruoso> er... Mass would be the correct analogy

[20:22] <ruoso> or else we need to call it AtomicSeconds instead of Duration

[20:22] <TimToady> nodnod

[20:22] <ruoso> and that probably makes sense

[20:22] <ruoso> (calling it AtomicSeconds instead of Duration)

[20:22] <TimToady> ugly

[20:22] <ruoso> but when will you need to specify that type anyway?

[20:22] <TimToady> it's fine to treat one particular unit as privileged

[20:23] <TimToady> especially when it's the gcd like seconds are

[20:24] <ruoso> gcd?

[20:24] <TimToady> well, no units above that are necessarily evenly divisible

[20:25] <ruoso> (gcd as in Greatest common divisor?)

[20:25] <TimToady> yes

[20:26] <ruoso> but what is the use case for declaring the type?

[20:26] <TimToady> mental abstraction

[20:26] <ruoso> but when would you need it?

[20:27] <TimToady> when you're thinking :)

[20:27] <ruoso> heh...

[20:28] <ruoso> alright... when would you use it in a code example?

[20:28] <TimToady> when the error message tells you "Illogical attempt to multiple two Durations"

[20:28] <TimToady> *multiply

[20:29] <ruoso> ahm... ok

[20:29] <Tene> TimToady: "... available precision subset precision ..."?

[20:29] <TimToady> and so that you can know that when you add one to an Instant, you get another Instant

[20:29] <TimToady> but when you add it to a Duration, you just get more Duration

[20:31] <Tene> TimToady: "... created either via any of <only one branch of either>."

[20:31] <TimToady> and more generally, to prevent you from confusing foot-pounds with newtons, if you're NASA

[20:31] <frettled> :)

[20:31] <ruoso> TimToady, okay... point taken... so Duration and Durance?

[20:31] <frettled> And even more generally, if you're doing time keeping.  ;)

[20:31] <TimToady> Tene: feel free to clean up sloppy prose where it's obvious

[20:31] <TimToady> and we all know that Durances are kinda vile :)

[20:37] <TimToady> that's insufficient

[20:38] <TimToady> by which I don't mean POSIX TZ

[20:39] <ruoso> TimToady, but that are attributes....

[20:39] <TimToady> maybe just Z for Zone, and Zulu

[20:39] <ruoso> the calendar set modifies even which attributes are that

[20:39] <TimToady> calendar set is part of culture

[20:39] <ruoso> right right... 

[20:40] <TimToady> I make no claims that the triple is a completely orthogonal vector space :)

[20:40] <TimToady> but they seem to be the minimal useful vector

[20:40] <ruoso> but I insist... the pivot is the culture

[20:40] <ruoso> space and time are just attributes around that pivot

[20:42] <frettled> I like just "Time", because it's sort of all-encompassing, but "Tm" is a nice abbreviation.

[21:54] <mathw> Evening

[21:56] <jnthn> oh hai, mathw 

[21:56] <mathw> how're things?

[21:58] *** PacoLinux joined
[21:58] <jnthn> About as normal as I could hope for, given I move country next week. :-)

[21:58] <frettled> jnthn: ooh, congrats!

[21:58] <frettled> AIU, I haven't been paying attention.  Which country?

[21:58] <jnthn> frettled: I'm moving to Sweden

[21:59] <frettled> w00t

[21:59] <jnthn> frettled: Aren't you somewhere in Scandinavia?

[21:59] <frettled> jnthn: surströmming all year for you!

[21:59] <frettled> jnthn: Yes, Oslo, Norway.

[21:59] <frettled> Are you moving to somewhere near masak++?

[21:59] <jnthn> When I make my millions, I'll come and visit Oslo for a beer.

[21:59] <jnthn> ;-)

[21:59] <frettled> he

[22:00] <frettled> and that's all you'll be able to afford! ;)

[22:00] <jnthn> Not too near to masak++...but not too far away either. :-)

[22:00] <frettled> 100 SEK: 81.670, 82.470 NOK

[22:00] <frettled> Darnit, still stable.

[22:00] <mathw> oooh I liked Sweden

[22:00] <mathw> where in Sweden are you going, jnthn?

[22:00] <jnthn> mathw: Lund

[22:01] <frettled> nice

[22:01] <mathw> oh right near Denmark

[22:01] <jnthn> Aye

[22:01] <mathw> not very near where I went

[22:02] <jnthn> Well, not as near as, say, Malmo, or Helsingborg. But still very close.

[22:02] <mathw> a lot nearer than Stockholm or Uppsala

[22:02] <mathw> I forget that Sweden extends that far south

[22:02] <mathw> and gets so close to Denmark

[22:02] <mathw> so that there are bridges

[22:02] <jnthn> Yeah

[22:02] <jnthn> I can probably get to Copenhagen in < 1 hour by train.

[22:03] <mathw> which is awesome

[22:03] <jnthn> Yeah

[22:03] <mathw> where can I get to in < 1 hour by train

[22:03] <mathw> ...

[22:03] <jnthn> Well, I've had Vienna about an hour away for the last couple of years too. :-)

[22:03] <mathw> Leicester

[22:03] <mathw> Derby

[22:03] <mathw> chesterfield

[22:03] <mathw> how exciting

[22:03] <jnthn> THRILLING!

[22:03] <jnthn> No.t

[22:03] <jnthn> *Not

[22:03] <mathw> ooh ooh ooh

[22:03] <mathw> Mansfield!

[22:03] <mathw> oh wait no Mansfield's a shithole

[22:03] <jnthn> omg how do you resist going there like, all the time?

[22:04] <jnthn> ;-)

[22:04] <mathw> because I like to keep my aikido within the dojo...

[22:04] <jnthn> lol

[22:04] <mathw> there was a self-defence special class today

[22:04] <mathw> outside in the rain

[22:04] <mathw> in a car park full of puddles

[22:04] <mathw> and, apparently, cat poo

[22:04] <mathw> all in the name of realism

[22:04] <jnthn> Serves you right for wishing wetness on me the other day. :-P

[22:04] <mathw> I went to the normal class and did my testing instead

[22:05] <jnthn> Aww.

[22:05] <jnthn> :-)

[22:05] <mathw> I'm not quite mad enough to do the outdoor classes yet

[22:05] <mathw> I'm sure it'll come

[22:05] <jnthn> Work on Rakudo.

[22:05] <jnthn> It'll come.

[22:05] <jnthn> :-)

[22:05] <mathw> lol

[22:06] <mathw> you're probably right

[22:06] <mathw> I have a sudden urge to call you sensei

[22:08] <lichtkind> so wiki has 6 new articles and over 27 edit made today :)

[22:08] <mathw> \o/

[22:08] <mathw> It's great to see the progress on the wiki updating

[22:08] <lichtkind> :)

[22:08] <mathw> lichtkind++

[22:08] * jnthn hopes none of them were spam

[22:08] *** Chillance joined
[22:08] <jnthn> lichtkind++ :-)

[22:09] <lichtkind> thanks

[22:09] <lichtkind> no the new stuff is about audrey, allison , chromatic, damian, jonathan leto

[22:09] <lichtkind> and historic implementations

[22:09] <lichtkind> so most people have now an article

[22:10] <lichtkind> mathw: do want your own? :)

[22:10] <mathw> it would be ridiculously short

[22:10] <lichtkind> or just lurker? :)

[22:10] <mathw> I don't get much done

[22:10] <lichtkind> most are already :)

[22:10] <lichtkind> doesnt matter its community im not your boss

[22:11] <lichtkind> mathw: so what you were involved?

[22:11] <mathw> mine would say something like 'Wants to do things, but spends too much time playing music and  going to aikido classes'

[22:11] *** kensanata left
[22:11] <lichtkind> aikido is important

[22:12] <mathw> my senseis would be pleased to hear that :)

[22:12] <lichtkind> even if some say the only one ever mastered aikido was ujeshiba

[22:12] <mathw> it depends where you draw the line

[22:12] <mathw> is there even anywher eyou can draw it?

[22:12] <mathw> nobody stops learning

[22:14] <lichtkind> mathw: ujeshiba defeated samurai with swords with its empty hands :)

[22:14] <mathw> I'm not denying he was good

[22:15] <lichtkind> he was aura sensitive

[22:15] <lichtkind> mathw: so you hack on rakudo or parrot?

[22:15] <mathw> I think my name's on one commit somewhere in rakudo :)

[22:16] *** athenot joined
[22:17] <sjohnson> is the anticipated rakudo release still coming around the mountain in a month or two?  

[22:17] <jnthn> .oO( she'll be coming round the mountain when she comes... )

[22:17] <jnthn> sjohnson: April is still the target. :-)

[22:17] <mathw> the bit that always got me was the bit about riding three white horses

[22:18] <mathw> or was it six?

[22:18] <mathw> which is just even more ridiculous

[22:18] <mathw> must be mini horses

[22:18] <mathw> anyway, time for me to have a bath before all my muscles seize up

[22:18] <jnthn> ride(all(@horses))

[22:18] <mathw> goodnight

[22:18] <jnthn> night, mathw 

[22:20] <sjohnson> sweetness

[22:34] <pmurias> lichtkind: aura sensitive = you mean he had supernatural powers?

[22:36] <lichtkind> pmurias: from standpoint of an cow rational thinking is supernatural :)
