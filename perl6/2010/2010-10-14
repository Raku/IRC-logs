[09:47] <moritz_> we just need more masaks in here :-)

[09:47] <frettled> masak: perhaps we remain stunned by the language barrier evidenced the other day!

[09:52] <masak> frettled: it goes further back than that...

[09:55] *** muixirt joined
[09:56] * muixirt is looking at http://mfollett.com/finalized-perl-6-talk-slides

[09:56] <moritz_> somehow those slides don't work for me

[09:57] <moritz_> is there somewhere a simple .pdf version, or a plain mpeg video or so?

[09:57] <frettled> masak: oh.  I've been too busy to notice.  :(

[09:57] <daxim> works for me

[09:57] <daxim> it's just slideshare/embedded

[09:58] <moritz_> slideshare usually also doesn't work for me

[09:58] <moritz_> javascript from a dozen different domains

[09:59] <masak> frettled: there's almost been more action on p6l than on #perl6... and the conversation on p6l has been very non-bikesheddy. kind of a mirror universe.

[09:59] <moritz_> I guess that adblock plus or ghostery kills one of them, and the rest is not robust

[09:59] <muixirt> rakudo: my $foo = 11; say ("\$foo is an " ~ $foo.WHAT)

[09:59] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«$foo is an Int()␤»

[09:59] <frettled> masak: Yes, I noticed that there has been a bit of a flurry regarding threads and such.  Even intelligent conversation.

[10:00] <muixirt> slide 16 says it is Any

[10:00] <muixirt> btw is that a new behavior of rakudo?

[10:00] <moritz_> no

[10:01] <masak> frettled: nod. I regret that alester didn't manage to recruit anyone from this channel to be a contact person re threads, though.

[10:01] <moritz_> .WHAT always gives you the type of the object, not of the container

[10:02] <frettled> masak: I was nearly tempted, but I don't think my current combination of work and personal life makes me a good coordinator.  :(

[10:02] <muixirt> moritz_: and the object in this case is?

[10:02] <masak> frettled: nodnod. everyone has to make such choices.

[10:02] <moritz_> muixirt: 11

[10:03] <masak> but Perl 6 is taken forward by very busy people. it's those who know to prioritize, and get important things done :)

[10:03] <frettled> masak: :)

[10:03] <frettled> I hope that I get my messes cleared out within a few months, so that I can get going on things like this again!

[10:04] * moritz_ thinks that other issues than threads are more pressing atm

[10:04] *** QinGW1 left
[10:04] <masak> moritz_: please elaborate.

[10:05] <moritz_> masak: on the spec side: determining (in)finiteness of sequences/lists. IO.

[10:05] *** pythonian4000afk is now known as pythonian4000

[10:06] <moritz_> on the implementation side: speed. Robustness.

[10:06] <masak> I agree that all those are more *important*, indeed.

[10:06] <masak> and that threads are correspondingly the Wrong things to focus on if they thereby detract from those areas.

[10:07] <masak> but I'm not sure they are.

[10:07] <masak> s/are/do/

[10:07] *** icwiener left
[10:07] <moritz_> masak: I'm not saying it's wrong to focus on threads; I'm just saying that for me other areas are more pressing, thus *I* will not focus on threads

[10:07] <daxim> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension   perl6 example?

[10:08] <moritz_> additionally I don't have much experience with threads, so I'd not be of much use

[10:09] <masak> same here.

[10:09] <masak> I'd be happy to try them out once there's something there.

[10:09] <masak> I have some experience in breaking things I don't understand :P

[10:09] <moritz_> :-)

[10:10] <masak> by the way, could someone help me find out where to get information about the new NPW 2010? the one's to be held in November?

[10:11] <masak> all I find is the old NPW 2010 page, and other information about the canceled meeting.

[10:11] <moritz_> is there no contact information on the old page?

[10:12] <masak> not that I can see. http://npw2010.fsfi.is/

[10:12] <masak> but I believe I might have their email address somewhere...

[10:13] <daxim> Jonas Brømsø Nielsen <jonasbn ÄT gmail.com>

[10:13] <masak> oh, indeed. he stepped up as organizer, no?

[10:13] <masak> daxim++

[10:14] * masak emails jonasbn

[10:14] <daxim> right; this is from the act mauling list

[10:16] <moritz_> rakudo: say ([[1, 2], 3] >>*>> 0 >>+>> 42).perl

[10:16] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«[[42, 42], 42]␤»

[10:16] <moritz_> \o/

[10:16] <moritz_> I've just used this pattern in Mathematica

[10:17] <moritz_> my goal was to replace the values of a nested data structure by the mean of these values, while preserving the structure

[10:18] <masak> nice.

[10:19] <moritz_> (this is a crude way to simulate laser injection locking of grouped pulses; the mechansim is slow enough to average over fast pulse trains)

[10:21] <masak> rakudo: say ([[1, 2], 3] <<+>> [4, [5, 6]]).perl

[10:22] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«[[5, 6], [8, 9]]␤»

[10:22] <masak> heh :)

[10:22] <moritz_> this is cool and a bit scary

[10:22] <masak> rakudo: say ([[1, 2], 3] >>+<< [4, [5, 6]]).perl

[10:22] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«Sorry, sides are of uneven length and not dwimmy.␤  in 'hyper' at line 184:CORE.setting␤  in <anon> at line 209:CORE.setting␤  in 'hyper' at line 1␤  in main program body at line 1␤»

[10:22] <moritz_> rakudo: say ([[1, 2], 3] <<~>> [4, [5, 6]]).perl

[10:22] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«[["14", "24"], ["35", "36"]]␤»

[10:22] <masak> I'm thinking whether this error message is LTA.

[10:22] <masak> the sides are in fact not of 'uneven length'.

[10:23] <masak> (well, they are both of length 3, which is not an even number, but...) :)

[10:24] <moritz_> what could we say instead?

[10:24] <masak> good question.

[10:24] <masak> printing out the contents of the sub-arrays might be a Bad Idea for big arrays.

[10:24] <moritz_> "the structures on both sides of non-dwimmy hyperop are not congruent"

[10:25] <masak> I like that better.

[10:25] * masak submits rakudobug

[10:25] <masak> moritz_++

[10:25] <moritz_> left: 1 element

[10:25] <masak> excellent.

[10:25] <masak> yes!

[10:26] <masak> lunch &

[10:27] * moritz_ has no idea how hard the nesting level will be to obtain

[10:28] <flussence> wouldn't the code that prints the error know where it went wrong?

[10:29] <moritz_> rakudo: say ~((1, 2, 3, 4) <<+>> (1, *, 5, 6))

[10:29] <p6eval> rakudo 5d23e3: OUTPUT«Can't take numeric value for object of type Whatever␤  in 'Any::Numeric' at line 1379:CORE.setting␤  in 'infix:<+>' at line 7257:CORE.setting␤  in <anon> at line 211:CORE.setting␤  in 'hyper' at line 1␤  in main program body at line 1␤»

[10:29] <moritz_> rakudo: say ~((1, 2, 3, 4) >>~<< (1, *, 5, 6))

[10:31] <moritz_> flussence: the code for hyper is spread out over half a dozen multis, and there are three die()s in there concerning non-equal length

[10:33] <flussence> oh, hm.

[10:34] <moritz_> but that would be nice project to work on

[10:34] <moritz_> maybe another challenge?

[11:50] <masak> we got some 1s stuck in a bend of one of the tubes earlier today.

[11:51] <moritz_> good thing we know about forward error correction

[11:52] <masak> forward error correction isn't just a truck that you dump stuff on.

[11:53] <moritz_> right; it's more like a protective cladding for stuff that you dump on a truck

[11:53] <takadonet> morning all

[12:00] <masak> takadonet: fine, thanks. a slight bit out of the Perl 6 world, but fighting to get back in the game.

[12:01] <masak> takadonet: and u?

[12:02] <takadonet> masak: Having trouble with some objects in Perl 6 but otherwise doing great

[12:02] <masak> any way we can assist?

[12:03] <masak> moritz_: if you want at some point, I'd like to discuss .new, .clone, and object invariants.

[12:04] <takadonet> I know the answer.... just cannot remember how to do. Normally I avoid asking the same question in the channel 

[12:04] <takadonet> i have only about 15 mins then really work will begin

[12:04] <masak> takadonet: if I followed such a rule (only asking once), you'd hear a lot less of me :P

[12:04] <takadonet> s/really/real

[12:04] <takadonet> hehe

[12:04] <takadonet> ok.

[12:05] <takadonet> Object has an attribute Str $.start_pos is rw;

[12:06] <takadonet> I want to make my own accessor since I want to have a post and/or pre process to ensure that it meets a certain criteria 

[12:07] <masak> takadonet: making your own accessor that does pre/post-processing is (at the point Rakudo is today) incompatible with having the accessors act like they do per default. :/

[12:07] <moritz_> then you should declare it as private, not  public and rw

[12:08] <takadonet> ahhh

[12:08] <masak> you can, however, make a set_start_pos or whatever and make it work like you want.

[12:08] <takadonet> see that is my workaround but I'm getting tired of having lots of workarounds

[12:09] <moritz_> then implement 'is rw' on methods

[12:09] <moritz_> and submit patch to [email@hidden.address]
[12:09] <takadonet> every few months I tried to do the 'right way'

[12:09] <moritz_> (or bribe another developer to do it for you :-)

[14:19] <takadonet> what does: "get_attr_str() not implemented in class 'Sub' mean?

[14:21] <plobsing> takadonet: it likely means you tried to use a parrot sub (does rakudo wrap them?) as an object

[14:22] <masak> golf and p6eval, that's the ticket.

[14:22] <takadonet> plobsing: I'm not even using a parrot sub....

[14:22] <takadonet> i know masak

[14:22] <plobsing> get_attr_str is the vtable method used to look up object properties

[14:23] <masak> we can help you to the extent that you golf and eval :)

[14:55] <Smokz> Hello

[14:56] <masak> hi!

[14:56] <Smokz> Hi!

[14:57] <masak> hello

[14:57] <Smokz> So what is this really

[14:57] <masak> an excellent question!

[14:57] <masak> this is really an experiment in human endurance.

[14:58] <Smokz> Haha

[14:58] <Smokz> Well

[14:58] <Smokz> Let me tell you how I got here

[14:58] <masak> how long can we make people wait before we make a release? :)

[14:58] <moritz_> but we already made a release

[14:58] <masak> moritz_: I keep forgetting.

[14:58] <moritz_> which gives the whole thing a funny paint :-)

[14:58] <Smokz> A 

[14:59] <Smokz> I read an article

[14:59] <masak> \o/

[14:59] <Smokz> "How to become a hacker" from some well-known guy

[14:59] <masak> nice.

[14:59] <Smokz> And here I am

[14:59] <moritz_> so, what do you want to hack on?

[14:59] <Smokz> He mentioned Perl 

[15:00] <Smokz> Well

[15:00] <masak> many of us here are hackers, and we'll happily share all our secrets with you. problem: it will take 10 years.

[15:00] <masak> and there's no way to speed up the process.

[15:00] <Smokz> I'm really new to this I know nothing about hacking really

[15:00] <Smokz> But I want to get a hold of it

[15:01] <masak> yay!

[15:01] <moritz_> Smokz: then I'd recommend you start by buying a book, and read it from front to cover

[15:01] <moritz_> and try out the things you've learned along the way

[15:01] <moritz_> I can recommend "Learning Perl" by Randal L. Schwartz et. al.

[15:02] <masak> perhaps also "Modern Perl" by chromatic.

[15:02] <moritz_> (though it's about Perl 5, and we're discussing Perl 6 here)

[15:02] <Smokz> What book would that be? The author of the article claimed that the best hackers were self-learned.

[15:02] <masak> Smokz: self-learning does not preclude books.

[15:02] <masak> Smokz: see http://www.perl.org/learn.html

[15:02] <Smokz> True that (when I think about it)

[15:02] <Smokz> I will do that in a moment

[15:02] <Smokz> but first

[15:03] <Smokz> From what I read I understood that perl is a programmer-language? 

[15:03] <masak> yes.

[15:03] <masak> a really good one, too.

[15:04] <masak> (in my opinion)

[15:04] <Smokz> So for example how do you translate "Hi" into perl-ian? I get a feeling it's not that type of language.

[15:05] <moritz_> rakudo: say "Hi'

[15:05] <moritz_> rakudo: say "Hi"

[15:05] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused at line 22, near "say \"Hi'"␤»

[15:05] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«Hi␤»

[15:05] <Smokz> Cool!

[15:05] <slavik1> rakudo: print "Hi!"

[15:05] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«Hi!»

[15:05] <slavik1> :)

[15:05] <moritz_> Smokz: it's not a language like English or German - it's a set of instructions, glued by grammar rules

[15:06] <moritz_> rakudo: print (1..10).join(', ')

[15:06] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10»

[15:06] <slavik1> rakudo: say join ', ' 1..10

[15:06] <masak> rakudo: my $name = "Smokz"; say "hi $name!"

[15:06] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused at line 22, near "say join '"␤»

[15:06] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«hi Smokz!␤»

[15:06] <Smokz> So in what way does it help a hacker, this perl language?

[15:06] <slavik1> rakudo: say join ', ', 1..10

[15:06] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10␤»

[15:06] <slavik1> ok, that still works, good. :)

[15:07] <masak> Smokz: so, imagine you're a hacker and want the computer to do things for you. Perl is a language to express to the computer what you want done.

[15:07] <masak> Smokz: not only that, it's a language that supports both small, quick scripts and large applications.

[15:07] <slavik1> host is list.join(delim) interpreted versus join(delim, list) ? or are they the same once 'compiled'?

[15:07] *** mblackmer joined
[15:07] <slavik1> I hope that question makes sense

[15:08] <masak> slavik1: it does. and I think the answer is "no".

[15:08] <moritz_> slavik1: internally, the sub form is re-dispatched to the method form

[15:08] <masak> slavik1: because of the different argument order.

[15:08] <moritz_> slavik1: but that's done at run time, not at compile time

[15:08] <masak> right. they dispatch, they are not "the same".

[15:08] <Smokz> I see, this is far more complex than I thought, but still interesting. And how do I write to you only masak?

[15:08] <masak> Smokz: here on IRC? you do "/msg masak ..."

[15:08] <slavik1> I see, is there an efficiency difference?

[15:09] <masak> slavik1: one extra call in the case of the 'join' sub.

[15:09] <moritz_> slavik1: naturally the sub form is slower, because it's one more call

[15:09] <slavik1> so basically, the perl5 form is faster

[15:09] <moritz_> no

[15:10] <moritz_> perl 5 form = sub form

[15:12] *** Schwern left

[15:18] <x3nU> why there is limit? ;f

[15:18] <mfollett> colomon:  Thanks, STL-PM is having a Perl 6 golfing match and someone ran into % and %% return improper values and I didn't know if that was a bug or just out of spec.

[15:19] <moritz_> x3nU: because bigint NYI

[15:19] <colomon> spec says it's unlimited, but as moritz_ says, we only have machine native Ints so far.

[15:19] *** justatheory joined
[15:19] <flussence> 2**34 % 5 works on my 64-bit box

[15:20] <mfollett> colomon:  So that'll change in the future?

[15:20] <flussence> weird that **33 works on 32-bit though...

[15:20] <colomon> and while in theory the answer depends on whether you have 32 or 64 bit ints, in practice things start getting wonky when you go over 32-bit Ints.

[15:24] <colomon> yeah, see, if you do 2**63 / 5, Rakudo will return a Num even on a 64-bit platform, I believe.  and that Num will lose the last 4 or 5 digits' worth of accuracy

[20:59] <jnthn> raukdo must smoke a lot.

[20:59] <molecules> @masak, @sorear, @jnthn (and anyone else I missed)Thanks for the feedback everyone.

[20:59] <sorear> can't we just call it らくど

[20:59] <masak> molecules: anytime.

[20:59] <diakopter> raduko must dump alot

[20:59] <sorear> molecules: twitter much? ;)

[20:59] <diakopter> wait, I don't see raduko on there.

[21:00] <molecules> @sorear not at all

[21:00] <sorear> Then I wonder where this '@sorear' is coming from

[21:00] <molecules> The only chatting I've really done is here, unless you count comments on StackOverflow

[21:00] <masak> sorear: prefixing with @ could be seen as a honorific, implying op-ness.

[21:01] <molecules> That's what people use for comments on stackoverflow. That is it here?

[21:01] <diakopter> no

[21:01] <molecules> That's what people use for comments on stackoverflow. What is it here?

[21:01] <frettled> molecules: they probably got it from Twitter.

[21:01] <sorear> foo: and foo, are commonly seen, but there's no one official way

[21:02] <frettled> for instance, yes!

[21:02] <frettled> (and no problem)

[21:03] <sorear> @molecules It doesn't really matter, I was just amused

[21:03] <molecules> sorear: Thanks for helping me avoid future embarassment

[21:05] <masak> molecules++ # welcome to the team! here's your badge.

[21:06] <molecules> masak: Thanks. What's the badge? Sorry about my irc illiteracy. :-)

[21:07] <frettled> masak: why not a pope card? :)

[21:07] <masak> molecules: the badges look like this. http://modules.perl6.org/

[21:07] <masak> molecules: you get a courtesy "newcomer badge", self-expiring in 7 days.

[21:08] <masak> frettled: I'm fresh out of pope cards. I've had an unprecedented number of pope visits lately.

[21:08] <molecules> masak: Thanks.

[21:09] <masak> also, the newcomer badge looks much better than those on that page. I never professed to being able to draw well :)

[21:12] <diakopter> www.yahoo.com down?

[21:13] <diakopter> masak: :)

[21:13] <diakopter> finance. and mail. seem to work tho

[21:13] <masak> molecules: out of curiosity: what brings you here this fine evening?

[21:14] *** _kaare left
[21:17] <molecules> I was frustrated with perl 5.8.8 not having the defined-or operator and was thinking about writing a module like Perl6::defined_or. However, I wanted to be sure I knew how it worked in Perl 6.

[21:17] <molecules> I was also just looking at Using Perl 6 and noticed that // doesn't show up.

[21:18] <masak> molecules: arguably, it should be in there.

[21:18] <masak> rakudo: my $a; $a //= 42; say $a

[21:18] <molecules> Table 3.1 has a list of "example" operators. Do we want to include an appendix with all of the operators?

[21:18] <p6eval> rakudo 46b2c5: OUTPUT«42␤»

[21:19] <frettled> molecules: I'm using the defined-or operator as an argument for converting to Perl 5.12.x at work (or at the very least, 5.10.1).

[21:21] *** skids left
[21:21] <molecules> frettled: Good luck. I tried arguing for upgrading, but now that you mention it, I should bring up niceties like defined-or.

[21:21] <frettled> Thanks, and good luck to you, too.

[21:22] <frettled> One of my other arguments is version parity across our installed system base.

[21:22] <masak> bring up niceties like 'say', 'given/when', and smartmatching, too.

[21:22] <molecules> Definitely. I guess I need to actually demo them to be persuasive.

[21:23] <frettled> Most of our client-side servers run Debian Lenny, which has 5.10.0 (sigh), but several backend servers use Slackware with 5.8.x (argh).  That means I either have to cripple my code to work in all places, or use different code.  Gnarly.

[21:24] <frettled> The problem, as I see it, is that $boss still codes Perl 4, but in Perl 5, with the exception of learning how to do elementary Perl 5 OO (Y2K-style) a couple of years ago.

[21:24] <frettled> It's an uphill battle, then, to argue for new features, which he doesn't comprehend the need for.

[21:25] *** cognominal left
[21:25] <frettled> Trying to work with Perl _6_ under those conditions is rather funny.  :D

[21:25] <molecules> frettled: Borrow one of his 100-line programs and whittle it down to 25 lines using new features. :)

[21:26] <frettled> I value my sanity.
