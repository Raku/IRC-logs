[21:27] <ash_> those all won't pass in master rakudo, but they do in ng btw 

[21:27] <jnthn> ash_: Cool. :-)

[21:28] <jnthn> ash_: Looks fine to me, for Array is good to have too...

[21:28] <ash_> although it shouldn't be hard to fix them in master 

[21:28] <Tene> oh man, my other plans for today fell through.  I guess I should be working on updating ng to parrot trunk, then...

[21:28] <jnthn> ash_: Dunno if it's spec somewhere if .new on List and Array do that.

[21:28] <ash_> well its not, but if you do List.new its immutable, which seems rather useless...

[21:29] <jnthn> ash_: Oh, I agree it should be spec.

[21:29] <ash_> i haven't seen it in the spec's yet, but they seem logical to have 

[21:29] <jnthn> ash_: I was hinting that a spec patch would be cool to have with the tests too. :-)

[21:29] <ash_> ah, well i can look into extending S32-Containers then

[21:30] <jnthn> Aye.

[21:30] <jnthn> ash_++

[21:30] <Tene> :)

[21:30] <ash_> should i call the file create.t? or new.t? it has to do with creating new lists and not specifically List.new

[21:32] <Tene> I'd say the former.

[21:32] <Tene> it can always be renamed later, remember.

[21:32] <ash_> yeah, okay

[21:33] <vamped> I'm wondering how the simple regex syntax s:g/x/y/  is coming along

[21:36] <ash_> i think i have a commit bit to pugs for the spec but i don't remember my username, is there anyway i can check? 

[21:38] <jnthn> vamped: ng is closer to the STD grammar, so it should - in theory - be closer now.

[21:39] <jnthn> vamped: It does reply on adverb parsing which I'm not sure we've a good handle on yet though (e.g. to parse the :g).

[21:39] <jnthn> vamped: I don't know how hard that is...it's all parsing stuff, which I'm not so hot on.

[21:40] <jnthn> ash_: I'd try and check for you, but http://commitbit.pugscode.org/ is a bit of a blocker to that... :-/

[21:41] <ash_> ah, well i'll just put them in a gist or something and someone else can commit them when i am done

[22:15] <jnthn> ash_: For now in Rakudo, a class. Think it may need to become a role in the future though.

[22:15] <ash_> the spec says its a role 

[22:16] <jnthn> Aye

[22:16] <ash_> doesn't doing RoleName.new make a blank object and apply the role to it? 

[22:16] <jnthn> Yes.

[22:16] <jnthn> That's "punning"

[22:17] <jnthn> role Foo { }; Foo.new # actually creates an anonymous class that does the role and instantiates it.

[22:18] <ash_> were in the spec should i but the sub list(*@args) ? i see sections for objects, but not where to put functions 

[22:20] <jnthn> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/S32-setting-library/Containers.pod seems to have functions too.

[22:21] <uniejo> ng: say +(list(),5,(7)); say +(list (),5,(7))

[22:21] <p6eval> ng 2717d0: 3␤2␤

[22:24] <ash_> thats an odd functionality...

[22:25] <ash_> ng: say (list(), 5, (7)).perl;

[22:25] <p6eval> ng 2717d0: (List(), 5, 7)␤

[22:26] <ash_> is it supposed to flatten the lists? 

[22:26] <jnthn> Yeah.

[22:26] <jnthn> Think so.

[22:26] <ash_> ng: say (1, 2, (3, 4)).perl

[22:26] <p6eval> ng 2717d0: (1, 2, 3, 4)␤

[22:31] <ash_> hmm... http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Lists says "No flattening happens to a lazy list until it is bound to the signature of a function or method at call time (and maybe not even then)." i kinda thought that mean (1, 2, (3, 4)) shouldn't flatten unless you make it, but maybe .perl or say is making it flatten

[22:36] <ash_> jnthn: so you know, trunk parrot throws an error now for .lex if you pass anything other than a PMC, not sure if you saw that, chromatic added that

[22:36] <jnthn> ash_: I think you menetioned it here on channel earlier, and I read it there. :-)

[22:36] <jnthn> ash_: Good to have, thanks for chasing that up.

[23:01] <colomon> ash_: .perl shouldn't be flattening it, as far as I know.

[23:04] *** colomon__ is now known as colomon

[23:05] <colomon> ng: say (1, 2, list(3, 4)).perl

[23:05] <p6eval> ng 2717d0: (1, 2, (3, 4))␤

[23:06] <ash_> ng: say +(1, 2, (3, 4, 5))

[23:06] <p6eval> ng 2717d0: 3␤

[23:06] <ash_> hmm, wonder why the above was flattened then

[23:08] <colomon> is (3, 4, 5) a Capture rather than a List?  I don't understand how that works, but it can be funky, I know.

[23:09] <colomon> sorry for "line noise", I'm on the floor with my boy and he is being rambunctious.  

[23:09] <colomon> luckily I have distracted him with the laptop's power cord at the moment.
