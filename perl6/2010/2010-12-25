[15:29] <masak> merry Christmas, isBEKaml.

[15:29] <masak> in Sweden, the main action takes place on the 24th.

[15:30] <masak> but yes, I enjoyed myself.

[15:30] <isBEKaml> I've seen pics of "Meanwhile, in Sweden..." on reddit. So, I guessed it must be good fun being there. 

[15:30] <isBEKaml> ;)

[15:31] <isBEKaml> and women/ladies drinking wine enjoying themselves. Well, you can guess. ;)

[17:27] <minotaur> Indeed!

[17:27] <minotaur> I'll admit, I'm new to these parts of the interwebs .... what I can do to help the Perl commune?

[17:28] <TimToady> what are you interested in?

[17:28] <minotaur>  For the moment, I can help test stuff out .... I still need to sharpen my hacking skills to be able to contribute in any significant way. 

[17:29] <minotaur> I just finished building my new toy - a Phenom II box with Gentoo on it. 

[17:29] <TimToady> well, to start with, you can build rakudo and see how the test suite works on it

[17:30] *** kfo left
[17:30] <Juerd> l.

[17:30] <Juerd> s/l.//

[17:30] <TimToady> a lot of people have been doing testing by writing little applications of varioius sorts, and when they run into a bug that's not in the test suite, they report it

[17:31] <TimToady> any reported bug will eventually have a test of some sort

[17:31] <TimToady> or just nopaste the bug here, and masak++ will report it for you :)

[17:31] <minotaur> Cool.

[17:32] <TimToady> to get an idea of what is possible so far, I'd look at http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6

[17:33] <TimToady> there are 248 examples of working code for small tasks there

[17:33] <minotaur> rakudo-2010.10/2010.08.01/2010.07 ? I see three ebuilds (a gentoo equivalent of rpm) listed

[17:33] <minotaur> Great! Thanks for pointers.

[17:33] <TimToady> it's usually better to work against the git head

[17:33] <TimToady> since it's regression tested, it's probably more capable than something from 07

[17:34] <TimToady> and pretty stable

[17:35] *** dju joined
[17:35] *** felliott left
[17:35] <minotaur> I usually prefer using ebuilds - makes for cleaner patching when new stuff gets rolled out, imo. But I guess I can download the source and manually compile it.

[17:41] <TimToady> at least for now, there aren't all that many dependencies into your OS that you'd have to worry about, and the head is quite a bit more capable than something 5 months old

[17:43] <minotaur> Ah. 2010.10 is also available - which is from 2 months ago. In any case, I just started building 2010.11. 

[17:43] <TimToady> 12 will be out very shortly :)

[17:44] <TimToady> but for some reason most of the developers are a bit distracted today...

[17:44] <minotaur> I guess I'll have to post on the gentoo forums to ensure we (the gentoo gnu/linux users) skip straight to 12! :)

[17:46] <minotaur> parrot is busy trudging away ...... weee!

[17:46] <TimToady> there's also niecza, which is less far along but likely to be faster sooner

[17:46] <TimToady> that requires mono though

[18:30] <isBEKaml> I'll be going over all of perl6advent Dec 2010. :)

[18:34] <isBEKaml> I got a question about MAIN. Is it possible to have named options? I could say ./foo.p6  -x 42 -y 24. x and y being named arguments. Not too different from GetOpt? 

[18:34] *** lichtkind joined
[18:34] <inkjetunit> hi. so. p6 currently requires p5 for bootstrap. is this phase going to last for long?

[18:34] <TimToady> isBEKaml: certainly

[18:35] <TimToady> inkjetunit: depends on the implementation

[18:35] <inkjetunit> so there are many implementations aswell. hmm

[18:36] <sorear> i don't think pugs has any p5 components

[18:36] <TimToady> the niecza implementation (on mono) hopes to be free of p5 in a month or so

[18:36] <TimToady> sure it does

[18:37] <lichtkind> cheers

[18:37] <TimToady> that's one of the ways it does regex

[18:37] *** am0c^ joined
[18:37] <TimToady> (at least historically)

[18:37] <isBEKaml> TimToady: let me just try that and get back. I think I just forgot the syntax, but vaguely recall something like being available with subs. :s

[18:37] <TimToady> it could also use rakudo regex or pcre, iirc

[18:38] <TimToady> I could be confabulating the p5 regex connection, but certainly pcre is p5ish

[18:39] <TimToady> which is why pugs could do m:p5// much better than m//

[18:41] <TimToady> isBEKaml: S06:3178

[18:41] <isBEKaml> ah, now I get it. I just have to prefix the vars in the sub definition signature with a ":". :)

[19:02] <isBEKaml> I"m currently at Day 4 and got a bit confused by the wording here: "Those of you with backgrounds doing floating point math are probably sputtering about the dangers of assuming that adding .1 repeatedly will add up to exactly 2.

[19:38] *** Psyche^ joined
[19:38] <pmurias> sorear: i could try with a fresh perl

[19:38] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[19:39] <sorear> that would be good

[19:39] <sorear> this is one of the reasons I want to ditch p5 - sucky deployment...

[19:40] <pmurias> sorear: what's your perl version?

[19:40] <sorear> TimToady: does / <.userdefined (.)> / mean / <.userdefined: rx { (.) }> /, or something more magical?

[19:40] <sorear> 5.12.0

[19:40] <pmurias> sorear: what to you want to ditch p5 for? p6?

[19:41] *** kanishka left
[19:46] <pmurias> sorear: what's NAM? saw a mention of that in the TODO, but can't find anything about it in the #parrot logs

[19:47] <pmurias> sorear: do you want to make niecza run on lorito through NAM or implement NAM on .NET?

[19:50] <sorear> NAM one of the IRs; it currently lies on the border between the .NET-specific and the nonspecific code

[19:50] *** am0c joined
[19:50] <sorear> it also has a serialized form, and lies between the (Perl 5) front and middle ends, and the (C#) back end

[19:51] <sorear> the main module for NAM is called CgOp; it predates the name

[19:51] <sorear> I'd like to turn the front and middle parts into Perl 6 or another CLR language

[19:52] <sorear> then deployment can just be "here, have 10MB of .dlls and .exes"

[19:56] <Guest39886> hi Everyone

[19:56] <masak> hi, Guest.

[19:56] <sorear> Hello.

[19:57] <Guest39886> can someone tell me how to write a sub signature that "matches" the empty list?

[19:58] <Tene> you mean no params at all?  or a param that can only match an empty array?

[19:59] <masak> rakudo: sub foo([]) { say "empty list matched" }; foo([])

[19:59] <p6eval> rakudo cae7f9: OUTPUT¬´empty list matched‚ê§¬ª

[20:00] <Guest39886> like this: multi sub f ([$a, *@rest], $b, $c){‚Ä¶ code with list} M multi sub (???, $b, $c){‚Ä¶ code without list} (lispish/prologish list recursion way)

[20:01] <Tene> Guest39886: [], like masak said

[20:01] *** icwiener left
[20:03] <Tene> rakudo: multi sub f ([$head, *@tail]) { say 'more'; f(@tail) };  multi sub f([]) { say 'done' }; my @a = qw/foo bar baz lol/; f(@a);

[20:03] <p6eval> rakudo cae7f9: OUTPUT¬´more‚ê§more‚ê§more‚ê§more‚ê§done‚ê§¬ª

[20:04] <Guest39886> rakudo: multi sub sum([$a, @rest]){sum(@rest) + $a}; multi sub sum ([]){0}; sum([2,3])

[20:04] <p6eval> rakudo cae7f9: OUTPUT¬´No applicable candidates found to dispatch to for 'sum'. Available candidates are:‚ê§:(Positional  (Any $a, @rest))‚ê§:(Positional  ())‚ê§‚ê§  in 'sum' at line 22:/tmp/xcft9O9tUe‚ê§  in main program body at line 22:/tmp/xcft9O9tUe‚ê§¬ª

[20:04] <Guest39886> whats wrong with my multi definition?

[20:04] <sorear> you said @rest

[20:04] <sorear> needs to be *@rest

[20:05] <Tene> rakudo: multi sub sum([$a, *@rest]){sum(@rest) + $a}; multi sub sum ([]){0}; sum([2,3])

[20:05] <p6eval> rakudo cae7f9:  ( no output )

[20:05] <Tene> rakudo: multi sub sum([$a, *@rest]){sum(@rest) + $a}; multi sub sum ([]){0}; say sum([2,3])

[20:09] <masak> we're mostly happy when people learn things in public. :)

[20:10] <masak> it's useful for those of us who are thinking about how best to teach Perl 6.

[20:13] <Tene> Also helps those who are less-public about their learning by watching others learn.

[20:14] * masak .oO( learning voyeurs... )

[20:14] <Tene> I like to watch.

[20:15] <masak> Tene: there are these instruction videos, too.

[20:18] <masak> the comments of http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/day-24-yule-the-ancient-troll-tide-carol/ are like a little fishbowl view of the Perl 6 community and its surroundings. :)

[21:23] <pmurias> sorear: a fresh perl 5.12.0 with STD installed raises the same error

[21:24] <pmurias> no sorry

[21:24] <lue> rakudo: grammar A { proto regex B { B {*} b }; multi regex B:sym<C> { Cc }; multi regex B:sym<D> { Dd }; }; A.parse("BCcb", :rule<B>)

[21:24] <p6eval> rakudo cae7f9:  ( no output )

[21:25] <lue> any idea why it's not DWIM ?

[21:25] <moritz_> what does it do?

[21:25] <moritz_> you didn't even produce any output

[21:25] <moritz_> how do you know what it does?

[21:26] <lue> rakudo: grammar A { proto regex B { B {*} b }; multi regex B:sym<C> { Cc }; multi regex B:sym<D> { Dd }; }; say A.parse("BCcb", :rule<B>) # oops :)

[21:26] <lue> .oO(I'm used to not having to type say in the REPL)

[21:27] <moritz_> probably just NYI

[21:27] <moritz_> note that rakudo's proto regex implementation is from times when {*} still meant "execute an action method here"

[21:28] <lue> aww :( . It would be easier than typing B b in every regex. I'm having problems with my grammar since I introduced proto regexes, but I'll figure it out.

[21:28] *** glow left
[21:28] <lue> would s/{*}/<...>/ fare much better?

[21:28] <moritz_> probably not

[21:29] <moritz_> but you can still have a  token wrapper { <common_prefix> <rule_you_actually_meant_to_write> }

[21:31] *** HarryS joined

[22:05] <pmurias> sorear: does niecza run spectests?

[22:06] <tadzik> no, it has no eval, and spectests like eval

[22:07] <lue> when you match to a proto regex, can you see which one it matched? (e.g. if I match <B>, can I see if it's B:sym<C> or B:sym<D>?)

[22:09] <flussence> the <C> is in <.sym>, iirc

[22:11] <lue> $/<.sym> does nothing.

[22:13] <flussence> this might be informative, dunno: https://github.com/moritz/json/blob/master/lib/JSON/Tiny/Grammar.pm

[22:22] <TimToady> nothing is ever in <.sym>, because the purpose of the . is to suppress capture

[22:54] <tadzik> hey

[22:54] <lue> Is there a way to see which regex of a multi/proto regex matched? (e.g. B:sym<C> or B:sym<D>)

[22:56] <masak> sorear: generally, I found the slashdot comments to be unusually upbeat, and then the usual trolling about linenoise.

[23:03] <masak> lue: that's something that an action method could do. I won't guarantee there isn't an even better method, but that's one solution, at least.

[23:05] <lue> makes sense. I just happened to be focusing on the grammar right now, so I forgot about that part :)
