[03:04] <colomon> something

[03:04] <Maerten> woww

[03:05] <Maerten> the first reaction on this stupid app

[03:05] <Maerten> :p

[03:05] <Maerten> are you using a blackberry??

[03:06] <colomon> no, I'm a regular chatter on the perl 6 chat you have stumbled across.

[03:06] <colomon> Another couple days of this and we will kill the person who wrote that app.

[03:06] <Maerten> ok.. what is this perl 6 about??

[03:06] <colomon> But you're welcome in the meantime.  :)

[03:07] <colomon> It's a programming language.

[03:07] <colomon> one which is still under heavy development.

[03:07] <Maerten> ok ok

[03:07] <colomon> this channel is primarily for discussing the various programs that implement the language, and designing the language itself.

[03:08] <Maerten> okay

[03:08] <Maerten> so this chat app just ruines the chatbox

[07:45] <p6eval> rakudo 142d22: OUTPUT¬´42‚ê§¬ª

[07:45] <sorear> the := operator in Rakudo is implemented in a deliberately wrong way.  Be grateful if it works, don't complain too much if it doesn't

[07:46] <masak> I'm not complaining; I'm submitting a rakudobug.

[07:46] <sorear> implementing := correctly would require an extra layer of indirection on all variable references

[07:46] <masak> yes.

[07:46] <masak> I have a few blog posts about that.

[07:48] <masak> huh; re-rendering all the HTML of my blog now takes 8m18.500s.

[07:50] <sorear> If you put it on github or otherwise make it public I'll use it as an example of real world performance code

[07:51] <cxreg> how about a layer of misdirection?

[07:52] <masak> sorear: I will put it on github, soonish. but for it to be used as real-world performance code, one'd have to use a frozen dataset.

[10:23] <jnthn> moritz_: The trickier issue is that the business world struggles to see the value in taking the time to do so.

[10:32] <sorear> I just pushed a LHF document for Niecza

[10:33] <moritz_> enodalek?

[10:33] <sorear> dalek failed to report my last two commits

[10:33] <moritz_> maybe because it's not in the channel at all?

[10:33] <sorear> no, it was in the channel beforehand

[10:34] <sorear> diakopter -HUP'd it

[10:34] <sorear> after being silent

[10:34] <sorear> and it didn't come back

[10:34] <sorear> diakopter: moritz_: theory: dalek is having issues with the fact that github no longer supports HTTP

[10:34] <sorear> all requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS now

[10:35] <sorear> niecza: say 2+2

[10:38] <moritz_> just produces a run time error

[10:38] <sorear> I guess some library isn't in the chroot

[10:39] <sorear> I recently switched niecza to pass /debug to the C# compiler

[10:39] <moritz_> does that mean I need to install mono-dbg etc.?

[10:41] <sorear> I hadn't realized it was an optional component

[10:42] <moritz_> sorear: do you use Debian (or a derivate thereof)?

[10:42] <sorear> yes, but I have upstream mono

[10:45] <sorear> libmono-2.0-cil?

[10:46] <sorear> s/-//

[10:46] <moritz_> the -dbg packages did not help - I suspect they contain debug symbols, but don't provide any additional runtime for debugging mono programs

[10:46] <sorear> libmono2.0-cil contains Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter

[19:11] <jnthn> takadonet: Last weekend I got a LOT of stuff done.

[19:11] <jnthn> This week, I'm having to focus quite a bit on $dayjob so haven't got so much done.

[19:11] <takadonet> jnthn: I saw! Good job

[19:11] <takadonet> ahhh

[19:11] <jnthn> (Teaching a course next week and getting the material in shape is taking a little effort. :-))

[19:12] * sorear added a docs/LHF to niecza in an attempt to draw attention

[19:12] <jnthn> Anyway, planning to have another push on NQP.Net in the next few days

[19:13] <jnthn> And then move on to spending a bit of time getting nqp-rx a bit further forward.

[19:13] <takadonet> cool

[19:13] <jnthn> Get it switched further to the new meta-model implementation, and port the mutli stuff I got fleshed out in NQP on .Net.

[20:07] <flussence> do those correspond to ctype.h?

[20:07] <colomon> jnthn: is <print> limited to ASCII?

[20:09] <jnthn> sjohnson: S05 only says "Match a single printable character.

[20:09] <jnthn> so far as I can see

[20:09] <jnthn> gah

[20:09] <sjohnson> i've ran out of good ideas for p6 :9

[20:09] <jnthn> That was in answer to colomon's question.

[20:09] <sjohnson> they've been done already!

[20:09] <flussence> poking at the source, it seems the answer to all of the above is "yes"

[20:09] <jnthn> Perl 6 tends to go on unicode properties for the built-in char classes.

[20:09] <colomon> jnthn++

[20:09] <jnthn> So I'd be surprised if it was ASCII only.

[20:10] <jnthn> Not sure what unicode character property it maps to off hand.

[20:10] <jnthn> rakudo: say "a\nb" ~~ /<print>/

[20:10] <p6eval> rakudo 142d22: OUTPUT¬´a‚ê§¬ª

[20:10] <jnthn> Ah, it's implemented though :-)

[20:12] *** makkksimal left
[20:12] <sorear> rakudo: "‰∏É" ~~ /<print>/

[20:12] <p6eval> rakudo 142d22:  ( no output )

[20:12] <flussence> these are all defined in parrot languages/pge/PGE/Regex.pir if anyone else is curious, around line 150

[20:12] <jnthn> rakudo: say  "‰∏É" ~~ /<print>/

[20:12] <p6eval> rakudo 142d22: OUTPUT¬´‰∏É‚ê§¬ª

[20:12] <jnthn> \o/

[20:13] <jnthn> flussence: Apart from Rakudo doesn't use PGE any more these days. :-)

[20:13] *** dju left
[20:13] <sbp> what are the printable characters in unicode terms?

[20:13] <jnthn> https://github.com/perl6/nqp-rx/blob/master/src/Regex/Cursor-builtins.pir is where it's at nowadays.

[20:13] <flussence> I went looking for xdigit first, "print" isn't the most greppable thing... :)

[20:13] *** dju joined
[20:14] <sbp> e.g. in terms of General Category Values

[20:14] <jnthn> ;)

[20:14] <jnthn> .tailcall '!cclass'(self, 'print', .CCLASS_PRINTING)

[20:14] <sorear> in ASCII-land, print is everything except controls

[20:14] <sbp> so everything except C[cfson]?

[20:14] *** Chillance joined
[20:15] <sorear> nonspacing marks might also be nonprintable

[20:15] <sorear> you need to read perluniprops

[20:16] <sbp> nonspacing: those are Cf right?

[20:16] <sbp> e.g. U+2062 INVISIBLE TIMES (Cf)

[20:17] <sorear> I meant stuff like COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT

[20:17] <sbp> hmm

[20:17] <jnthn> .oO( U+2062 would make a great caption for a lolcat looking at its wrist, but there's no watch there. )

[20:18] <sorear>     $print = $perl->add_match_table('Print', Description => 'Characters that are graphical plus space characters (but no controls)', Initialize => $Blank + $Graph - $gc->table('Control'),);

[20:18] <sbp> phenny: ask TimToady what <print> should match. S05 says a "single printable character", but what is a printable character in General Category Value terms? everything except for C[cfson]? sorear suggests Mn should be excluded too. Cf. TR44 ¬ß 5.7.1

[20:18] <phenny> sbp: I'll pass that on when TimToady is around.

[20:18] *** justatheory joined
[20:20] <sbp> perhaps moritz_ or pmichaud will know too?

[20:20] <sorear> the definitive reference for Perl/Unicode mapping is lib/unicore/mktables, a 14,757 line perl script which extracts relevant data

[20:20] <sorear> mktables makes very clear what \p{Print} matches

[20:20] <sbp> .g lib/unicore/mktables

[20:20] <phenny> sbp: http://grokbase.com/topic/2009/11/24/mktables-gets-stuck-on-win32/HIr_qrBaLrwmwbQ4qGTgJBMddyQ

[20:20] <flussence> the proximity of print next to those other things makes me think it's based on ctypes though, and I think it's a bit confusing if it differs from other languages' implementation of that...

[20:20] <sorear> and S05 makes very clear that /<print>/ = rx:P5/\p{Print}/

[20:23] <sbp> ['IsPrint',  '$cat =~ /^([LMNPS]|Co|Zs)/',	'']

[20:23] <sbp> from http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/duckwater/duckwater-hg/usr/src/cmd/perl/5.6.1/distrib/lib/unicode/mktables.PL

[20:23] <flussence> oh, there's \p{PosixPrint} in perl6 too... guess that clears things up.

[20:23] <flussence> *5

[20:24] <sbp> so that's everything except Z[lp] and C[cfsn]

[20:24] <sorear> sbp: 5.6.1 is ancient history

[20:24] *** ggoebel joined
[20:24] <sbp> first thing that I found; better references welcome

[20:27] <sorear> http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/lib/unicore/mktables

[20:27] <szbalint> for unicode stuff, you need at least perl 5.10.x

[20:27] <flussence> IsPrint is also explained in perlretut.pod, in 5.12.2

[20:27] <szbalint> git for bleed is good though

[20:35] <sbp> gah. well from sorear's URI it seems the following are excluded:

[20:35] *** sftp joined
[20:35] <sbp> Surrogate SG (Cs)

[20:35] <sbp> Private_use Co

[20:35] <sbp> Noncharacter NChar (Cn)

[20:35] <sbp> Control Cc

[20:35] <sbp> Unassigned Cn

[20:36] <sbp> but I can't figure out why Noncharacter and Unassigned are both included, because that just means you're excluding Cn twice. so presumably they are not in fact isomorphic

[20:37] <sbp> and in this case, Mn would not be excluded

[20:37] <sbp> so I stand by my question

[20:38] <sorear> ask #p5p

[20:41] <sbp> I don't even see where S05 states that /<print>/ = rx:P5/\p{Print}/

[20:41] <sbp> you said it makes it very clear ‚Äî where so?

[20:41] <sbp> I've searched all references of "perl5", "perl 5", and "p5". did I miss something?

[20:42] <dnl> rˆh

[20:42] <sorear> S05:1908

[20:42] <sorear> also S01:27 is a fundamental rule

[20:43] <moritz_> well, we would benefit from a clearer and more explicit spec regarding the Unicode character classes

[20:44] <sbp> ah, I see; thanks. (for the logs, that is ‚ÄúThe C<\p> and C<\P> properties become intrinsic grammar rules such as‚ê§(C<< <alpha> >> and C<< <-alpha> >>).‚Äù)

[20:45] <sorear> moritz_: S01:27 should be reworded as a W3C-esque "Normative References" section?

[20:45] *** patspam left
[20:47] <moritz_> sorear: not at all. It would be just better if fallback to p5 semantics would be explicit where we want it

[20:47] *** MayDaniel left
[20:47] <moritz_> sorear: because there are also places where we fall back to p5 spec due to lack of existing p6 spec, not because we want it to

[20:47] <moritz_> and IMHO those two cases should be clearly distinguished

[20:48] <moritz_> maybe an explicit table which <foo> corresponds to which \p{bar}
