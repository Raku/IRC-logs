[01:05] *** HarryS left
[01:06] <lue> I read trying to turn a language-dependant AST into something gcc can understand is the best way to go, which is where I got the idea to use STD for the language parsing.

[01:06] <lue> [ Remember: no guarantees I'll actually do it, though :) ]

[01:07] <masak> it's entirely up to you :)

[01:07] <masak> I've had similar thoughts with Yapsi: putting STD as the frontend and C code/gcc as the backend.

[01:08] <lue> It all depends if I can actually get STD running right now :)

[01:08] <masak> there's a version on CPAN that you can install.

[01:08] * \xF0 giggles at STD

[01:08] <TimToady> just don't giggle infectiously...

[01:11] <lue> I would prefer to develop a perl6-gcc frontend locally, on my 12-year old laptop... it's going to take a while :)

[01:11] <tylercurtis> Some categories of typical Lisp macros seem easy to express as block-taking functions in Perl 6. For example, with-open-file, with-accessors, some looping forms.

[01:14] <lue> can the CPAN version be used in Perl 6 code? [or is it just a convenient way to install STD?]

[01:16] *** HarryS left
[01:17] <tylercurtis> lue: I don't think there are many Perl 6 implementations that can actually run STD. More accurately, I'm not sure if any other than viv can. Niecza is close, I think.

[01:46] *** HarryS left

[01:48] <TimToady> not if it's not a character class

[01:48] <cbk> ie <[1..9]>  

[01:48] <TimToady> <[a..z]> is only for character classes

[01:48] <cbk> oh ok.

[01:48] <TimToady> [ ] is just ( ) that don't capture now

[01:49] <cbk> so the [] is optional in the match?

[03:03] <lue> Good puzzle... I say you can't. The spec did say 0 ... 2,$x was the right way to count every other item up to $x, before TimToady fixed it.

[11:55] <tadzik> moritz: yep, but this error message is misleading a bit

[11:55] <tadzik> use lines() or () tells nothing

[11:55] <moritz> bbkr: as I've said twice before, I think it should be a compile time error

[17:13] *** Italian_Plumber left
[17:14] <masak> sorear: bbkr reported discrepancies between Rakudo and STD, without much consideration for which one is "right". I think that's fine.

[17:14] <sorear> masak: my reading of the tickets was very STD-normative

[17:15] <masak> "Rakudo allows postfix<:> in regexp(?) but STD doesnt"

[17:15] <masak> that just says they differ.

[17:15] <masak> not which one is right.

[17:15] <bbkr> masak: indeed. I'm not skilled enough to distinct Rakudo bug and STD bug. so if something is STD bug then just reject ticked. but discrepancy is something that should be reported anyway and fixed somewhere - in Rakudo or in STD.

[17:16] <masak> bbkr: STD bugs also belong in RT, according to some schools of thought.

[17:17] <diakopter> if it's called perl6 RT... maybe the current perl6 RT needs renamed to rakudo

[17:18] <bbkr> so how should I act when I spot disrepancy if I'm not supposet to report to RT?

[17:18] <[Coke]> you should report it to RT.

[17:18] <bbkr> thanks :)

[17:18] <[Coke]> (unless there is an STD specific bug queue of which I am not aware)

[17:19] <masak> diakopter: people have also been committing doc and book bugs to RT. most are using it as the 'rakudo RT', but not everyone.

[17:19] <diakopter> oh...

[17:19] <bbkr> [Coke]: if I spot something that I know for sure is STD then I report directly to TimToady, otherwise to RT

[17:20] *** Italian_Plumber joined

[17:31] <[Coke]> rakudo/rakudo has a link in the README, which is probably sufficient. also, bug in the README -> HTML generation: Rakudo's official web site is <http://rakudo.org/&gt;,

[17:33] <masak> moritz_: nqp-rx has a debug/trace facility. I haven't tried it much, but it seems to overlap slightly with your suggestion for manually adding debug statements.

[19:51] <colomon> I think prefix:<~> is deep magic.

[19:51] <TimToady> the functional form is probably more optimizable at compile time

[19:51] <colomon> unless masak++ fixed that during the Buf work?

[19:51] <moritz_>     $P0 = new ['Str']

[19:51] <moritz_>     assign $P0, a

[19:51] <masak> colomon: nope, didn't venture into prefix:<~>

[19:51] <moritz_> where a is a PIR string

[19:52] <colomon> moritz_++ # will try that next

[19:52] <moritz_> src/cheats/str-ops.pir

[19:52] <colomon>             $P0 = new ['Str']

[19:52] <colomon>             assign $P0, $S0

[19:52] <colomon>             %r = box $P0

[19:53] <colomon> does that look like the proper translation to Q:PIR?

[19:53] <[Coke]> s/box //

[19:53] <moritz_> no need for the box

[19:53] <moritz_> you can use %r instead of $P0 everywhere

[19:53] <[Coke]> or, %r = new [ 'Str'] ; assign %r, $S0

[19:53] <[Coke]> box is for going from basic types to PMCs. if you already have a PMC, it might just explode.

[19:54] <colomon> [Coke]++ moritz_++

[19:54] * colomon stopped the compile before the explosion.

[19:54] <moritz_> my $x = pir::new__pS('Str'); pir::set__PS($x, $x)  maybe

[19:55] *** EvanCarroll left
[19:57] <[Coke]> I think pir::set($x, ~$x) might be clearer.

[19:58] <[Coke]> also, pir::new('Str') should work these days.

[19:58] <moritz_> if you use ~$x, there's no need for the other magic

[20:00] *** Italian_Plumber left
[20:00] <colomon> I'm going with             %r = new ['Str']          assign %r, $S0   for now -- simple, seems like it ought to be reasonably efficient, and it appears to work.

[20:15] <moritz_> sorear: you mean a separate pass that checks the nesting?

[20:16] <sorear> moritz_: yes

[20:16] <sorear> moritz_: both passes being perl 6 grammars, potentially

[20:16] <moritz_> hm. Possible. But I thought that multi-pass parsing was evil.

[20:16] <rokoteko> ash_: http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.33/index.html .. Is it insane (the more or the less if you havent took a peek at perl5 sources) ..?

[20:16] <rokoteko> isn't Parrot supposed to be like perl5 xs for perl6?

[20:17] <sorear> no

[20:17] <sorear> not at all

[20:17] <rokoteko> how to make perl6 fast then?

[20:17] <moritz_> by optimizing it

[20:17] <ash_> rokoteko: if you need to link to foreign C code, you can do most of that with the parrot NCI system  

[20:18] <sorear> parrot is supposed to be like pp_*.c, sv.c, hv.c, cv.c, and Metaconfig for perl 6

[20:18] <sorear> run.c too

[20:19] <rokoteko> Ok, Im speechless. I was (previously) thinking that this is the biggest flaw that perl6 has. everyone knows C, who knows parrot.

[20:20] <rokoteko> how the fuck to *really* optimize eventually.

[20:21] <ash_> parrot's the vm rakudo is implemented on top of (currently), its kinda like how java can be compiled for the jvm 

[20:21] <sorear> RA-KU-DO

[20:22] <sorear> I hate this mindset of "perl6 = parrot"

[20:22] <rokoteko> ash_: are you trying to repeat to me why I think Java is a failier?

[20:22] <rokoteko> sorear: agreed.

[20:22] <[Coke]> sorear: I know. it's really bringing parrot down.

[20:22] <[Coke]> ;)

[20:22] <rokoteko> but Rakudo is the best implementation available.

[20:22] <ash_> rokoteko: i am not sure i follow 

[20:22] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: I'm not too fond of Java, but in what respect do you think that Java is a failure?

[20:22] <TimToady> except for where pugs is still the best implementation :)

[20:23] <rokoteko> tylercurtis: there is only one way to do it.

[20:23] <TimToady> oh that perl 6 would fail as badly as java!  :)

[20:23] <[Coke]> no joke. I /wish/ that many people hated perl 6. ;)

[20:23] <huf> that's impossible, perl6 is far too good a language to be adopted *that* widely

[20:24] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: What do you mean?

[20:24] <rokoteko> TimToady: I wouldnt mind every other kid at University being taught perl6 instead of Java.

[20:24] <TimToady> metoo

[20:24] <TimToady> but we have to get to the university professors while they're still in grade school.  :)

[20:25] <rokoteko> http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/06/higher-education-bubble-its-about-to.html

[20:25] <ash_> my professor in the spring did an independent study on vm's where i started on, nq-nqp, which isn't that far off from perl6 

[20:26] <ash_> he teaches the compiler class and thought the idea of a parser that didn't define itself till runtime was awesome btw 

[20:26] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: I can understand the complaint of Java not having a TIMTOWDI philosophy, but I don't understand how that relates to the JVM.

[20:27] <ash_> and, class starts in 5 mins, so got to go

[20:27] <TimToady> htaaof

[20:27] <sorear> The problem with JVMs is that there are too many of them and they all suck.

[20:27] *** ash_ left
[20:27] <TimToady> some of them don't suck at certain things though

[20:28] <moritz_> some have good JIT, reliable garbage collection, and good concurrency

[20:28] * sorear thinks Perl6 needs a proper ExtUtils::, but nobody else cares enough to make #cpan6sketch happen

[20:28] <TimToady> fsdo "good" and "reliable"

[20:28] <masak> "some of them don't suck at certain things" -- the same could be said of Perl 6 implementations.

[20:29] <TimToady> we care, we're just stretched too thin ourselves

[20:29] <rokoteko> TimToady: I didnt mention pugs. If I only had iq 140+ (I doubt Im even close to that), I wish I could understand it. :)

[20:30] <rokoteko> but Rakudo is good.. But it might take years to have advantages like XS to make it very powerful for the unusual hackers.

[20:30] <masak> sorear: I want you to know that I support your efforts with #cpan6sketch.

[20:30] <[Coke]> rokoteko: what sort of power are you looking for?

[20:30] <rokoteko> [Coke]: performance

[20:31] <sorear> People seem to like joining #perl6 just to complain.  I don't get it

[20:31] <sorear> We all know Perl 6 performance sucks

[20:32] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: If Perl 6 can't give you good enough performance, write it in C and use a FFI(which will hopefully look like Zavolaj).

[20:32] <sorear> rokoteko: you can, just not using Parrot

[20:32] <TimToady> that might've been the story in, oh, about 2003.

[20:32] <sorear> Parrot is a VM

[20:32] <sorear> the word you're looking for is FFI

[20:32] <[Coke]> there are layers upon layers here.

[20:32] <moritz_> rokoteko: the problem with rakudo's speed is a mixture of not using parrot optimal, and parrot not providing what rakudo needs

[20:32] <rokoteko> sorear: isnt that an acronym?

[20:33] <sorear> rokoteko: so is XS

[20:33] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: you can actually embed PIR or use PIR ops in Rakudo, but that's a bad idea, because that's not portable across implementations.

[20:33] <TimToady> XS is a pun on "excess"

[20:33] <rokoteko> sorear: ok. you know what XS is? :) mind telling me what FFI is ?

[20:33] <sorear> FFI = foreign function interface

[20:34] <sorear> it lets you run C code from Perl6

[20:34] <sorear> we don't have ExtUtils::CBuilder yet, you'll need to ship a separate .so

[20:34] <rokoteko> yes. lot's of time when I have mentioned XS I get reponses like "Why dont you use Inline::C?"  

[20:35] <\xF0> that's a horrible response

[20:35] <TimToady> they both have their place

[20:35] *** M_o_C joined
[20:36] <rokoteko> sorear: I just was thinking aloud that it will take a while. :) but I previously thought from this discussion that is .pir is supposed to be the same performance improvement as .xs. please pardon of me being wrong.

[20:36] <cognominal> rokoteko,  the  long term road to performance, with agility and maintainability is done by  having a good high level language runing on a smart VM. That's what Perl 6, Rakudo and Parrot are about even the latter two are not quite there yet.

[20:36] <cognominal> agility is a slogan, Perl 6 will make it a reality.

[20:36] <rokoteko> I really like rapid development. :) so here I agree with you cognominal.

[20:37] <TimToady> ooh, nice slogan. "Making slogans into reality."

[20:37] <sorear> rokoteko: Being wrong is not a sin, so I can't pardon it. ;)

[20:37] <sorear> Learning is even less of a sin

[20:37] <TimToady> .oO(Live and let learn.)

[20:37] <cognominal> TimToady turns every thing into meta

[20:39] <sorear> TimToady: What are the purposes of the cursor_xact calls on CursorBase.pmc lines 1858, 1872, 1886, 1900 ?

[20:40] <tylercurtis> rokoteko: another thing to consider is that Perl 6 is designed to be optimizable. For example, object attributes are more abstract so they can potentially be stored more efficiently.

[20:40] *** EvanCarroll joined
[20:41] *** hercynium joined
[20:41] <rokoteko> tylercurtis: ok. perl6 is designed to be optimizable. Im just sometimes having trouble where the Parrot fits in. but that is probably only because I dont know Parrot. hence the discussion :)

[20:42] <moritz_> parrot.org tries to describe what parrot is :-)

[20:42] *** patspam left
[20:42] <TimToady> sorear: they chop the backtracked bits out of the current xact chain so they don't have to be re-traversed later on

[20:42] <rokoteko> moritz_: havent diven in there yet :)

[20:42] <sorear> rokoteko: Parrot is an implementation factor of Rakudo.  It contains no user-servicable parts

[20:43] <rokoteko> moritz_: only scracthed the tip of the mountain (made of ice floating in an ocean)..

[20:43] <tylercurtis> Parrot's a VM that Rakudo happens to run on. And it theoretically makes it easier to integrate different languages together. For example, if you have Blizkost installed, you can do "use Some::Module:from<perl5>;".

[20:43] <sorear> TimToady: ... I don't see how

[20:43] <tylercurtis> Although the interoperability with Perl 5 through Blizkost is a bit limited.

[20:44] <rokoteko> sorear: I was trying to discuss of my (current) views of perl5 XS vs using Parrot underneath.

[20:44] <sorear> rokoteko: perl5 XS leaks a lot of perl5's implementation details

[20:44] <rokoteko> Im not here to dishonour anyone! only to appreciate and learn. dont take me wrong, I love Perl. :)

[20:46] <rokoteko> sorear: yes it does. and I kinda understand that the XS interface has been living (and optimized for years and years) and perl6 is new.

[20:46] <TimToady> sorear: okay, they don't chop it out, but they put anew false floor there to mark the track as "backed"  :)

[20:46] <rokoteko> sorear: but perl6 on parrot.. can it do the same for the Parrot (vs. XS) programmer?

[20:46] <TimToady> the back as tracked?

[20:46] <TimToady> the backtrack as ed?

[20:52] <TimToady> certainly they're all named with C first so that they *could* be recognized if we wanted to

[20:54] <TimToady> I might've thought that's what I was doing at the time

[20:55] <TimToady> marking all the xacts as invalid is really only for the other users who still may have them in flight; we could probably chop them from our current list

[21:51] <patrickas> I do the same in perl6 but name them $^a and $^b and then things get messy too! (just being silly :-)

[21:52] <masak> if things get messy in that case, then it's more a matter of LTA error messages. :)

[21:52] <masak> for example, it makes no sense to use those hats outside of a block.

[23:31] <TimToady> and they have it differently

[23:32] <TimToady> which explains some of the problem right there :)

[23:32] <alksentrs> What is it used for?

[23:32] <TimToady> things like generating filenames

[23:32] <TimToady> or other symbols that want to be unique

[23:33] <alksentrs> Would it be safer to use interpolation of numbers, or something?

[23:33] <huf> well... sortof ;)

[23:34] <TimToady> alksentrs: it depends on how you define "safer"

[23:34] <TimToady> certainly it could be just as well defined

[23:34] <alksentrs> In terms of Unicode?

[23:34] <TimToady> in the sense of any algorithm being repeatable

[23:34] <alksentrs> Locale? Codepoints vs Graphemes vs etc

[23:34] <masak> TimToady: the uses cases with generating filenames and other unique symbols doesn't really motivate the big section in S03 on exotic alphamets and Unicode number-y things.

[23:35] *** rurban left
[23:35] <TimToady> Graphemes don't have well-ordered codepoints

[23:35] <TimToady> there are many reasons to want sequences of single chars

[23:36] <TimToady> the carry is a bit less well motivated, but is there to keep the tendency toward uniqueness

[23:37] <alksentrs> How do other languages solve similar problems?

[23:37] <TimToady> by forcing the complexity onto the programmar and code reader, usually

[23:38] <masak> for the filenames/unique use case, you could keep a number in a separate variable, and build the strings yourself just-in-time.

[23:38] <masak> Yapsi does that in a couple places.

[23:38] <masak> rather than using the magical string increment behavior.

[23:45] <alksentrs> I was supposed to do a talk on the topic of my choice

[23:45] * masak would have loved to hear that

[23:47] <alksentrs> I showed them the "idomatic" Fibonacci generator thing

[23:47] <alksentrs> *idiomatic

[23:47] <alksentrs> I'm not sure if they were awed or apalled

[23:47] * masak beams

[23:48] <TimToady> sometimes s/pal/w/ over time

[23:48] <alksentrs> One asked if Perl 6 was optimized for toy examples, not production software

[23:48] <TimToady> it's a fair question

[23:49] <masak> basically the same objection mst had on Twitter.

[23:49] <TimToady> to which the correct answer is, the two are not mutually exclusive

[23:49] <masak> http://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/22112066276

[23:50] <TimToady> toys are how we learn Real Life when we're young

[23:50] <alksentrs> Another question that was asked: Why should people use Perl6 instead of Perl5? (c.f. People used C++ instead of C because of its OOP support.)

[23:50] *** drbean joined
[23:51] <TimToady> same with Perl 6 :)

[23:51] <TimToady> only in our case, it's true  :P

[23:53] <alksentrs> rakudo: ''>>.()

[23:53] <p6eval> rakudo f8e959: OUTPUT¬´Tried to find null name‚ê§  in main program body at line 22:/tmp/LpPTTKSQcE‚ê§¬ª

[23:54] <TimToady> the more serious answer is that Perl 5 programmers often don't notice when they're getting frog-boiled, and Perl 6 is designed to scale better

[23:54] <alksentrs> MONKEY_PATCHING doesn't scale...

[23:54] <alksentrs> does it?

[23:54] <TimToady> indeed, which is why we discourage it

[23:55] <TimToady> that's a strange one

[23:57] <alksentrs> What does unable to parse blockoid mean?

[23:57] <TimToady> usually it means it got a more specific error later, but didn't know how to describe it, and backtracked till the start of block

[23:57] <TimToady> and often in that case, STD will give you a better error

[23:58] <TimToady> if it is an error...

[23:59] <alksentrs> Is there a low-precedence method call operator?
