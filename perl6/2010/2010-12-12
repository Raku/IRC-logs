[04:15] <awm> How can someone volunteer to help the Perl6 project?

[04:23] <kthakore> awm: just volunteer

[04:23] <kthakore> which project do you want to help with?

[04:23] <kthakore> err

[04:23] <kthakore> I mean

[04:23] <kthakore> what part in the project do you want to help with?

[04:25] <awm> Well I suppose wherever volunteers might be needed.  I just love perl and would like to get involved even doing something non-programming really or whatever

[04:25] <kthakore> awm: first take a look at the different projects that constitute for perl. There is rakudo and parrot 

[04:26] <kthakore> have a look at their bug reports and see what you can do

[06:14] <sorear> masak: arnsholt: STD's OPP is in STD.pm6 itself.  Talking with TimToady and from personal experience I'd say that it's too hard to make a totally general OPP

[06:14] <sorear> You could steal the OPP from niecza's v6/STD.pm6; I think it's closer to being runnable with Rakudo

[06:15] <sorear> although you'll need to fix the subrule backtracking protocol

[06:16] <sorear> the original EXPR from std.git/STD.pm6 used labelled control flow and computed method calls; I had to heavily rewrite it for niecza

[06:17] *** Axius joined
[06:17] <sorear> also I'd like something like Match.synthetic to be standardized

[06:46] <TiMBuS> id like to get libyaml working in rakudo. should I use zavolaj or is it outdated/superseded?

[07:49] <masak> sorear: too hard to make "a totally general OPP"? that must be with LTM or something, becuase the one in PGE feels pretty general.

[07:57] <sorear> Can the PGE one handle postcircumfix operators?

[07:57] <masak> yes.

[07:57] <sorear> Can it handle null-string operators?

[07:57] <masak> yes.

[07:57] <sorear> Can it handle multiple OPPs in one language?

[07:57] <masak> er.

[07:57] <masak> when does that happen?

[07:58] <sorear> C has a language of types and a language of expressions, and they're mostly separate

[07:58] <masak> ah, so it's the same string that needs to be parsed with two "views"?

[07:59] <masak> no, it doesn't handle that.

[07:59] <sorear> so I suppose they're different languages in a sense

[07:59] <masak> unless you parse them twice.

[07:59] * sorear has never used PGE

[07:59] * masak has ported it

[07:59] <masak> here's the PGE OPTable parser in Perl 6: https://github.com/masak/gge/blob/master/lib/GGE/OPTable.pm

[08:00] <masak> that's alpha code, by the way.

[09:22] <moritz_> good morning

[09:22] <phenny> moritz_: 00:54Z <arnsholt> tell moritz_ Turns out EXPR isn't in Rakudo, only NQP, which makes my post a bit pointless. Sorry =/

[09:23] <sorear> good morning moritz_

[09:24] <sorear> masak: I'd love to see more discussion on a standardizable EXPR, if you think it's feasable.

[09:24] <masak> good morning, moritz_.

[09:25] <masak> sorear: I was thinking about ways to expose Perl6::Grammar as an API the other day.

[09:25] <masak> it seems that relatively often what people do is reimplement parts of Perl 6 parsin at great expense.

[09:26] <masak> having those parts accessible could help make some solutions ridiculously short, just by leveraging Perl 6 parsing and ASTs.

[09:30] <sorear> masak: I, too, would like to see an elaboration on S05:4035

[09:34] <masak> yes, that's a bit lean on details :)

[09:35] <masak> usually, the way to get more spec for these things is to run headlong into them with an implementation.

[09:39] <dalek> mu: 472fcb0 | moritz++ | misc/perl6advent-2010/ (2 files):

[09:39] <dalek> mu: [advent] some schedule and topic updates

[09:39] <dalek> mu: review: https://github.com/perl6/mu/commit/472fcb045e

[09:40] <tadzik> so still nothing for today?

[09:40] <tadzik> how about smartmatching?

[09:40] <sorear> can't we just use the OPP thing?

[09:40] <sorear> masak: aye.

[09:41] <sorear> masak: I would love to talk about this more

[09:41] <moritz_> tadzik: I just went through the list of topics, and thought that smartmatching was the easiest to write about on short notice

[09:41] <masak> sorear: me too. maybe at the #phasers on Tuesday?

[09:41] <sorear> masak: STD is, quite frankly, useless when taken strictly as a library

[09:41] <sorear> yes

[09:41] <sorear> I have lots of time then

[09:42] <masak> yes -- I think considering STD from the viewpoint of an API could be very fruitful.

[09:43] <sorear> I'm thinking I'll write an announcement for the 'v1' Niecza tag on the last Monday in November

[09:43] <sorear> December

[09:43] <sorear> and 'v1' will be set to mark the announcement

[09:43] <masak> sounds nice.

[09:43] <sorear> it'll be my own version of the "official and complete" gag - self-referential releases

[09:43] <masak> I'm hoping to get in quite a lot of niecza use until then.

[09:44] <masak> :)

[09:44] <moritz_> WOAH, AN 1.0 RELEASE!

[09:44] <moritz_> *scnr*

[09:44] <masak> yes, what moritz_ said. do make it v1.0 :)

[09:44] <masak> it'll complement "official and complete" nicely.

[09:45] <masak> so when newbtrolls say "no, but I mean an 1.0 release", we can counter that too :P

[09:45] <sorear> on the last Monday of November, I tagged v0.0

[09:45] <sorear> but forgot to mention that in the mail

[09:46] <masak> that's usually not a problem.

[09:46] *** nymacro joined
[09:47] <masak> especially not if you tagged it at the time of the announcement.

[09:47] <sorear> isn't Rakudo already at version 40.0?

[09:47] <moritz_> no, it's at version 2010.11

[09:48] <tadzik> WOAH!

[09:48] <sorear> !

[09:48] <masak> that's a seriously impressive version number.

[09:48] <tadzik> 2010.109999(9) was nice too

[09:49] <moritz_> This is Rakudo Perl 6, version 2010.11-15-gfedc117 built on parrot 2.10.1 RELEASE_2_10_1-697-g1ebb549

[09:49] <sorear> It's nothing compared to the STD version, though

[12:28] <TiMBuS> glad to help

[12:29] <TiMBuS> now if you happen to know how to take an int pointer from a C function and dereference it from parrot...

[12:29] <TiMBuS> id be really happy to hear how to do it :D

[12:29] <tadzik> :)

[12:31] <tadzik> I actually thought about writing a helper zavolaj-friendly C library to do what zavolaj can't do :)

[12:31] <TiMBuS> it might be handy

[12:31] <tadzik> so you would dereference_intptr()

[12:32] <tadzik> that's a bit workaround-y

[12:33] <tadzik> extendind Parrot NCI would be more noble

[12:34] <TiMBuS> i really cant figure out how to do it from parrot, either

[12:34] <TiMBuS> the Pointer PMC doesnt help

[12:48] <jnthn> TiMBuS: If you like, drop me a mail with the C function signature you're having trouble calling. I won't be able to look for the next week or so, but at least it'll be a reminder for when I do get some Zavolaj hacking time.

[12:48] <jnthn> (Zavolaj certainly needs to extensions. It'll get 'em.)

[12:48] <jnthn> (Parrot got better NCI support since I wrote Zavolaj.)

[12:55] <tadzik> jnthn: is reading the returned arrays (array poiters) supported?

[12:56] <jnthn> I believe that there's already some array support, yes

[12:56] <jnthn> And you can treat any pointed to thing as an array in a sense. :)

[12:56] <tadzik> any examples around?

[12:57] <jnthn> I think the mysql driver may do that to read the columns.

[12:57] <tadzik> oh, so Positional, not Array

[12:58] *** nymacro joined
[12:59] <jnthn> Yeah

[12:59] <tadzik> # Since mysql_fetch_fields() is not usable yet...

[12:59] <tadzik> yeah :)

[12:59] <jnthn> returns Positional of Int

[13:00] <tadzik> yes

[13:00] <tadzik> returning unhandled string type in struct -- I don't get it

[13:00] <jnthn> But if it returns an int pointer then using that and then [0] will be just like a dereference of the pointer.

[13:00] <jnthn> ?

[13:01] <tadzik> http://wklej.org/id/436480/

[13:01] <tadzik> ah, I see

[13:01] <tadzik> so, any way to use this now?

[16:12] <flussence> rakudo: class Foo { has $!obj; method BUILD() { $!obj = 1 } }; Foo.new.perl.say

[16:12] <p6eval> rakudo : OUTPUT«Foo.new(obj => 1)␤»

[16:12] <flussence> (that was just from blindly changing things until it worked though, so may not be the best answer)

[16:14] <flussence> s/method/submethod/ # now it's the right answer

[16:16] <tadzik> hmm

[16:32] <tadzik> now what worries me is that DESTROY is never called

[16:35] <tadzik> rakudo: class Foo { method DESTROY { say "I'm out" } } Foo.new

[16:35] <p6eval> rakudo : OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused at line 22, near "class Foo "␤»

[16:35] <tadzik> rakudo: class Foo { method DESTROY { say "I'm out" } }o Foo.new

[16:35] <p6eval> rakudo : OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Confused at line 22, near "class Foo "␤»

[16:35] <tadzik> bah

[16:35] <tadzik> rakudo: class Foo { method DESTROY { say "I'm out" } }; Foo.new

[16:35] <p6eval> rakudo :  ( no output )

[16:35] <tadzik> a bug?

[22:13] <jnthn> (though bye soon...need to sleep...early start tomorrow...)

[22:14] <sorear> jnthn: I'm wondering how javolaz will work in a non-Parrot environment

[22:15] <jnthn> ...javolaz?

[22:15] <jnthn> ...is that the worst spelling of "zavolaj" ever? :)

[22:15] <jnthn> sorear: I expect that has to be re-implemented per VM

[22:16] <jnthn> sorear: Thus why I encourage pepole to write things against it rather than against Parrot's NCI.

[22:17] <jnthn> I suspect it's not too bad to do a CLR version, and probably harder to do a JVM version.

[22:17] <jnthn> But at least only one thing needs changing. :)

[22:17] <sorear> Suppose I re-implement it for another VM

[22:17] *** am0c joined
[22:17] <sorear> How do I get people to use the new implementation?

[22:18] <flussence> .oO( maybe there needs to be a %*ENV{RAKUDOLIB} too )

[22:20] <jnthn> sorear: I think of it more about implementation portability. So long as you implement the same interface or close enough, modules that target Zavolaj today will "just work" (provided the other Perl 6 features they need are in place) in the implemntation targetting the other VM.

[22:24] <plobsing> .oO( javolaz might be a good name for zavolaj on jvm )

[22:24] <jnthn> :)

[22:24] <flussence> javalolz!

[22:24] <jnthn> hehe :)

[22:24] <plobsing> zavo

[22:24] <jnthn> OK, sleeps... &

[22:26] <plobsing> using zavolaj over raw parrot nci also has the advantages of dealing with an API which *should* be interested in being user-friendly (in stead of minimal-but-functional), and people bugging jnthn in stead of me when things go wrong

[22:29] <lue> Does anybody happen to know of a service that would let me run a P6 website? (IIUC, this means "what (kind of) web service can I run perl6 on?"

[22:31] <flussence> I guess anything that lets you run arbitrary binaries will... provided it's got the resources to run p6.

[22:33] <flussence> if it's got proper ssh, that's a good start

[22:37] <sorear> I wonder how hard it would be to integrate Niecza with ASP.NET

[22:38] <flussence> If you're thinking of FastCGI then it'll be slightly fiddly without root, as you'll have to run lighttpd or something on a port > 1024.
