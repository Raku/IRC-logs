[15:59] <masak> very quiet here today.

[15:59] <masak> no jnthn here to pun the silence away :P

[16:00] <tadzik> This silence is spunning me stiff

[16:02] <masak> let's talk about something interesting, then.

[16:03] * tadzik contemplates fingernails

[16:03] <tadzik> oh, Module::Tools as a backend for pls?

[16:03] <masak> \o/

[16:03] <masak> except that it'd have to be a local snapshot, then. pls is supposed to be dependency-less.

[16:04] <tadzik> well, neutro has deps too, and they're bundled so it can be boostraped

[16:04] <masak> nod.

[16:04] <masak> I once planned to make a couple of changes to S26. maybe the quiet today makes for a good background to attempt a (possibly controversial) patch.

[16:05] <tadzik> avoiding deps at all costs is silly imho. Especially if some of them are candidates to be the "3rd core" ones

[16:05] <tadzik> what kind of patch?

[16:06] <masak> well, deps are either avoidable, or essential for the installer to even bootstrap. I don't think we're in disagreement there.

[16:07] <masak> the patch was about changing the way declarator blocks attach to declarations.

[16:07] *** jaldhar joined
[16:08] <masak> at present, they attach through clever magic a la TheDamian. I'd like to change them to attaching through a less clever but more robust method.

[16:10] <masak> I'll try to locate the relevant backlog.

[17:12] * masak reads that backlog and tries to summarize

[17:14] * tadzik reads Pls.pm once again. . o O ( So implementing Pls is actually writing 8 methods... )

[17:14] <masak> :)

[17:14] <masak> something like that.

[17:15] <masak> there's still a yet-unrealized idea about making different multi methods correspond to different repository types. (GitHub, Gitorious, Google Code, etc)

[17:15] <tadzik> App::Pls::ProjectsState is about a config file mostly, so deps-of should be known before fetching?

[17:15] <tadzik> App::Pls::Fetcher is git in our case, and App::Pls::Builder/Tester/Installer is what M::Tools should do

[17:15] <masak> no, it can only be known after fetching.

[17:16] <tadzik> I see

[17:16] *** dju joined
[17:16] <masak> but pls is currently in a slightly inconsistent state wrt that.

[17:16] *** meppl left
[17:16] <masak> maybe that's what I should focus on tonight, rather than S26.

[17:17] <tadzik> I think JSON can be avoided now

[17:18] <tadzik> but right, that's a matter of implementation, not Pls itself

[17:19] <masak> it's tricky -- I picked JSON, because proto had only done a poor man's YAML subset, and I wanted something more robust. on the other hand, the JSON module is quite slow.

[17:19] *** Axius left
[17:19] *** dju left
[17:20] <tadzik> there is a in-parrot JSON implementation, which I partly got working

[17:20] *** dju joined
[17:20] <tadzik> well, it doesn't work for arrays

[17:20] <masak> ooh

[17:20] <masak> tadzik: I'm increasingly amazed at the number of things you have going on. :)

[17:20] *** Axius joined
[17:21] <tadzik> masak: I'm a lazy person, so I'm wasting my time on numerous things :)

[17:22] <tadzik> The semester has just started, and I'm the less-than-30-persons group of people who don't have any failed classes on their backs

[17:22] <masak> kudos.

[17:22] <tadzik> so, how do I get Parrot array from the Rakudo array? :)

[17:23] <tadzik> s:2nd/array/Array/

[17:23] <masak> let's go to #parrot and ask :)

[17:23] <tadzik> :)

[17:23] <tadzik> by the way, it's astonishing how 54% of CS students on the year fail the Programming classes

[17:23] *** Axius left
[17:23] <masak> tadzik: every heard of the camel's two humps?

[17:24] <tadzik> humps are those things on the camels' backs?

[17:25] <masak> also here: http://www.secretgeek.net/camel_kay.asp

[17:28] <tadzik> interesting

[17:28] <tadzik> about JSON: http://wklej.org/id/406539/

[17:30] <tadzik> hrm, I just realized it's about producing, not parsing :)

[17:30] <masak> pls needs to be able to do both.

[19:00] <masak> it's just an idea so far. I'll happily discuss it further.

[19:01] <masak> cxreg: I guess it could. I hadn't thought of putting that in as an essential part.

[19:01] <cxreg> it could be like nethack, but each of the monsters is a p6 operator

[19:05] <masak> ...except in some IEEE standards :)

[19:05] <masak> but not in real maths.

[19:06] <masak> the thing that becomes infinity is the limit of division by ever smaller numbers. and even then, only the limit from the right.

[19:06] <masak> lue: no, they would act as counterevidence.

[19:06] <masak> because the limit from the left would be -Inf.

[19:06] <masak> and hence the "actual" limit is undefined.

[19:07] <lue> I think we can agree x/0 is Very Interesting™

[19:08] <masak> it's not like it's a concept in need of deeper study in analysis.

[19:13] <masak> I believe I might have learned about it through Mark C. Chu-Carroll's blog.

[19:53] *** dual joined
[19:53] *** pjcj joined
[19:54] <flussence> I think the answer there is more laziness, doing nothing until something asks you for a .Array or .Num etc.

[19:54] *** MayDaniel joined
[19:55] <flussence> though that only helps if everything that depends on the context is called lazily...

[19:57] <flussence> having to learn functional programming to get the most efficient code does seem a bit suboptimal
