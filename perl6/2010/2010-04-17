[03:25] <diakopter> I mean, I'm glad it's already implemented in STD.pm6

[03:31] <lue> gah! elisp regex is so annoying. :*(

[03:35] <lue> is there a command in perl regex where you can match to anything (ascii, non-ascii, etc.), for example to match the comment in # and #`()

[03:36] <diakopter> do you mean . 

[03:37] <diakopter> or do you mean "anything but a right parens"

[03:38] <lue> for example. If i had #`([text here]), how would I match [text here] so that anything allowed as a comment is matched?

[03:38] <lue> same with #[text here], where the end of the comment is a \n

[03:39] <diakopter>  /#\([^)]*\)/

[03:39] <diakopter> and

[03:39] <lue> basically I just want to see how much better perl is than elisp :)

[03:39] <diakopter>  /#[^\n].*(?:\n|$)/

[03:40] <diakopter> er

[03:40] <diakopter>  /#[^\n]*(?:\n|$)/

[03:40] <lue> figures. while asking, I'm perusing through the elisp reference, and for THE FIRST TIME, I see . , which matches everything except newline :)

[03:40] <diakopter> yes. same with perl.

[03:40] <lue> *duh*

[03:41] <lue> I just have to remember the \\ for everything, because ( and [ are not special, by default. In elisp regex, you must use \( and \[ to make them do what you want them to do in a regex.

[03:41] <diakopter> but repetitions are greedy (consume as much as they can) by default, so you have to exclude whatever comes next to match the shortest

[03:42] <lue> so something involving [^...] then?

[03:42] <diakopter> yes, as above

[03:43] <lue> (In addition, regexes are stored as a string, so the backslash in \( must be escaped, resulting in \\( , \\[ , \\] , \\), and so on. :/)

[03:44] <lue> "#\\[^\n\\]*\n" might work in elisp, for example.

[06:36] <diakopter> slavik1: it's a thing I'm working on.

[06:36] <slavik1> do tell :)

[06:37] <diakopter> well

[06:37] <diakopter> where do I begin.

[06:37] <slavik1> an elevator sales pitch?

[06:37] <diakopter> it's a compiler compiler for the CLR (.NET and/or Mono)

[06:37] <slavik1> in p6?

[06:38] <diakopter> using it, I'm making this language called "perlesque" which is made up of a tiny subset of perl5 and a tiny subset of perl6

[06:38] <diakopter> no it's written in C#

[06:38] <slavik1> ok

[06:38] <diakopter> it compiles to CIL

[06:38] <slavik1> right

[06:38] <diakopter> I mean, my compiler compiler compiles to CIL

[06:39] <slavik1> through another version of compile and you lost me

[06:39] <slavik1> what the compiler you are compiling?

[06:39] <diakopter> I was just clarifying, in case by "right" you meant "I know that C# compiles to CIL".  I was clarifying that my compiler-compiler generates compilers that emit CIL.

[06:40] <slavik1> I see

[06:40] <slavik1> yes

[06:40] <slavik1> I understand that

[06:40] <diakopter> ok :)

[06:40] <slavik1> are you using grammars/regexes?

[06:41] <diakopter> yes, and they're p6-ish, but not as expressive.

[06:41] <diakopter> but expressive enough to quickly add syntax & actions

[06:41] <slavik1> I think I get it

[06:41] <diakopter> all in 1 source file

[06:41] <slavik1> you have your own yacc which produces a compiler not in binary (like gcc) but a compiler in CIL which is then run on whatever CIL runs on.

[06:41] <slavik1> did I get it right?

[06:41] <diakopter> yes.

[06:41] <diakopter> :D 

[06:42] <slavik1> mentioning yacc would've made it easier :)

[06:42] <slavik1> hmm

[06:42] <diakopter> (Mono 2.6 on Mac, *n*x, or Windows, or msft CLR on windows)

[06:43] <slavik1> technically, if the grammar/etc was standard or something, you could have compiler compilers that targeted different things

[06:43] <diakopter> yes.

[06:43] *** molaf left
[06:43] <slavik1> so then we can have a perl6 compiler in binary, jvm, cil, etc.

[06:43] <diakopter> yeah

[06:44] <slavik1> but why would write it in C# and not Perl? :P

[06:44] <diakopter> I didn't mention yacc b/c I've never used yacc

[06:44] <slavik1> oh

[06:44] <slavik1> neither have I :)

[06:44] <slavik1> I just know what it does

[06:44] <diakopter> nor any other compiler-compiler

[06:44] *** justatheory joined
[06:44] <diakopter> ... in theory.

[06:44] <diakopter> but anyways,

[06:45] <diakopter> I want to use perlesque as an assembly language

[06:45] <slavik1> definately sounds cool

[06:45] <diakopter> to which to target an emitter from STD/viv

[06:45] <slavik1> viv?

[06:45] <diakopter> so that TimToady's standard parser/front-end can compile itself to perlesque

[06:45] <diakopter> viv is short for V->IV

[06:46] <diakopter> or five->six

[06:46] <slavik1> ahh

[06:46] <diakopter> er

[06:46] <diakopter> hahahaha

[06:46] <slavik1> wait, are you using just enough of grammars/regexes to get perl6 compiler to compile?

[06:46] <diakopter> VI->V

[06:46] <diakopter> SIX->FIVE

[06:46] <diakopter> HA

[06:46] <slavik1> heh

[06:46] <slavik1> must be too late

[06:46] <diakopter> slavik1: yea, just enough

[06:46] <slavik1> I mised the 5->4 :P

[06:46] <slavik1> sounds neat

[06:47] <diakopter> to answer your other question

[06:47] <diakopter> why not perl

[06:47] <diakopter> b/c I wanted a strongly-typed language

[06:47] <slavik1> does mono/.net have java like management extensions?

[06:47] <slavik1> I see

[06:47] *** Trashlord left
[06:47] <diakopter> I don't know. what are java's management extensions

[06:47] <slavik1> then why not java? (had to be asked)

[06:47] <slavik1> imagine you have a jvm running

[06:48] <diakopter> jconsole?

[06:48] <slavik1> yes

[06:48] <slavik1> somewhat

[06:48] <slavik1> if you go to browsing mbeans you'll see what I mean

[06:48] <slavik1> imagine you have a web server written in java

[06:48] <diakopter> ok..

[06:48] * diakopter thinks of tomcat.

[06:49] <slavik1> you can have management beans that would store number of requests served, longest time, shortest, average

[06:49] <slavik1> diakopter: exactly

[06:49] <slavik1> diakopter: although tomcat is a 'container'

[06:49] <slavik1> for example, in Jboss, you can create a JDBC connection pool

[06:50] * diakopter isn't a Java programmer, but I've used/debugged it here and there

[06:50] <slavik1> and JMX allows you to see how many connections are already used and how many are available

[06:50] <diakopter> ok

[06:50] <slavik1> not only that, but you can stop/start sub systems this way

[06:50] <diakopter> broadly, the answer to your question would be "yes"

[06:50] <slavik1> k

[06:50] <slavik1> will have to look it up

[06:51] <diakopter> I doubt they're called "management extensions" though

[06:51] <slavik1> it will be nice when parrot has this.

[06:51] <diakopter> sounds like lingo

[06:51] <diakopter> well

[06:51] <slavik1> and, via JMX, you can get a dump of all thread stacks :)

[06:51] * diakopter barely able to bite his tongue

[06:52] *** iblechbot left
[06:52] <diakopter> I chose clr over jvm b/c I've had good experiences with Mono, and I hate Eclipse so much, and there was a great compiler library that was MIT-licensed that I started with, 

[06:53] <slavik1> lol

[06:53] <slavik1> fair enough

[06:53] <slavik1> in my view eclipse is nice, when you through lots of memory at it

[06:53] <slavik1> I am also finding that java as a language is beginning to slowly die ... in favor of groovy.

[06:53] <diakopter> and b/c I'd already flipped around from JavaScript to C# to Perl and back >10 times over the past 3 years...

[06:54] <diakopter> meh; it's all the same if they can be decompiled to each other reasonably readably.

[06:54] <diakopter> like all the 100+ clr languages

[06:54] <diakopter> disassembled, I mean.

[06:55] <chromatic> I would like to see such management extensions for Parrot as well.

[06:55] <diakopter> yeah, every VM's gotta have its "hot stuff" it feels it needs to hype so that the VM still sounds hip.

[06:55] <slavik1> groovy is dynamic though

[06:55] *** meppl left
[06:55] <diakopter> (I meant "hot stuff" to refer to Groovy)

[06:56] <slavik1> and it doesn't look like Java ... looking at java code makes me want to go to another profession

[06:57] <slavik1> diakopter: what do you use for Perl code?

[06:57] <diakopter> perl.exe?

[06:57] <slavik1> editor/ide

[06:57] <diakopter> heh

[06:57] <diakopter> Notepad++

[06:57] <slavik1> on unix?

[06:57] <diakopter> no

[06:58] <diakopter> wynders

[06:58] <slavik1> you don't code Perl on unix?

[06:58] <diakopter> no.

[06:58] <slavik1> :(

[06:58] <slavik1> poor soul

[06:58] <slavik1> either way, try geany :)

[06:58] <diakopter> geany

[06:59] <slavik1> yes

[06:59] <slavik1> it's an awesome editor

[06:59] <diakopter> Notepad++ has a very very responsive UI

[06:59] <slavik1> it doesn't run on Linux

[06:59] <diakopter> very pretty text rendering

[06:59] <diakopter> I don't need it to run on Linux.

[06:59] * slavik1 doesn't have a windows system

[06:59] <diakopter> I don't need you to have a windows system

[06:59] <slavik1> lol

[07:00] <diakopter> :P

[07:00] <diakopter> I wasn't trying to convert you

[07:00] <diakopter> I was stating the reason I like Notepad++

[07:00] <slavik1> I was ... 

[07:00] <slavik1> I failed :(

[07:00] <diakopter> I doubt something built on GTK+ can be as responsive as Notepad++

[07:00] <diakopter> but I'll try it.

[07:01] <diakopter> and...... sourceforge is down.

[07:01] <slavik1> FLTK is the way to go?

[07:01] <slavik1> yea

[07:01] <slavik1> some upgrade

[07:01] <slavik1> badmonkey on thinkgeek gets a discount :)

[07:02] <diakopter> I don't see a button to add the thinkgeek models to my cart.

[07:02] <diakopter> especially since thinkgeek is down as well.

[07:02] <slavik1> the site is coded in php, hence functionality is not possible

[13:00] <colomon> The question boiled down to: what should ^"501" do?

[13:01] <jnthn> Yeah, I can see where this is going... :-)

[13:10] <p6eval> rakudo 78faa0: OUTPUT«012345␤»

[13:11] <colomon> of course, once you know that's the problem, the workaround for the script is trivial.

[13:11] <colomon> thus http://www.harmonyware.com/pictures/foo.png

[13:12] <colomon> I killed that one when it was about 88% complete because it was slogging my MBP.

[13:12] <colomon> From now on I'm running them on my Linux workhorse.  :)

[13:14] <jnthn> Wow, pretty!

[13:14] <jnthn> But yeah, slooow. :-(

[13:14] <colomon> it took about 9 hours to generate that much, and it seemed like at that point it was generating another row every half hour or so.  :(

[13:15] <jnthn> It got slower over time?

[13:15] <colomon> I don't know.

[13:15] <colomon> It's hard to say, because the math gets harder as well.

[13:15] <jnthn> Ah, OK.

[13:16] <colomon> those outer layers go pretty quickly.

[13:16] <colomon> the inner stuff is the slowest.

[13:16] <colomon> however, it did consume an enormous amount of memory, so that may be slowing it down as well.

[13:17] <jnthn> Yeah, I fear a leak.

[13:17] <colomon> I'm going to run a series of timings on the Linux box to see what the time characteristics are.

[13:17] <colomon> but let's not obscure the big news here!

[13:18] <colomon> back in Dec, this script crashed most of the time on Rakudo (now alpha).

[13:18] <colomon> I'm not sure it ever went more than ten minutes and ended successfully.

[13:18] <colomon> today it went 9 hours, was still producing results, and only ended because I killed it.

[13:18] <colomon> \o/

[13:20] <jnthn> colomon: Well yes, that is progress on stability. :-)

[13:20] <jnthn> colomon: Are you making heavy use of complex numbers?

[13:20] <colomon> yes

[13:20] <jnthn> Yeah, we're pretty inefficient on those for the moment.

[13:21] <colomon> jnthn: sure.

[13:22] <jnthn> After Rakudo * when I do the native types work, you could be able to have like:

[13:22] <colomon> I still reckon it's a good test for general speed and stability.  It's mostly looping and simple math (wrapped in a class) after all.

[13:22] <jnthn> class Complex { has float $.re; has float $.im; }

[13:22] <jnthn> And then you'll have one object with two fields that are floats.

[13:23] <colomon> (That is, I don't expect it to have speed like tuned C at the moment.)

[13:23] <colomon> oooooo, cool.

[13:27] <colomon> Right now Complex is just two arbitrary types, and all the type resolution stuff has to be done for every operation, so it's not surprising it's not zippy.

[13:27] <jnthn> Aye.

[13:27] <moritz_> "not zippy" is a nice euphemism :-)

[13:48] * jnthn is glad that masak is back a *lot* before 2038.

[13:49] <masak> I realized that the Singularity will happen ~2035, so I wanted to contribute a bit to Perl 6 before that.

[13:50] <masak> lue: how is it to travel beyond 2035, by the way? would you describe it as mostly utopian or mostly dystopian?

[13:53] <colomon> jnthn: good news on the short front: going from 101 to 201 in mandelbrot size takes pretty much exactly as long as you'd expect (4x longer, that is).  no sign at all of any additional slowdown.

[13:54] <jnthn> Ah, OK.

[13:54] <jnthn> Just general epic slowness then.

[13:54] <colomon> well, memory usage is still a real issue

[13:55] <colomon> It got up to 3.x GB virtual on the MBP.

[13:55] <jnthn> Ouch.

[13:56] <jnthn> Do you keep a lot of values around in memory?

[13:56] <colomon> and this implementation just exports each line of graphics as it is calculated, so memory usage should be quite light.

[13:56] <jnthn> Right, so we're leaky.

[13:56] <jnthn> :-(

[13:57] <colomon> sounds like something that chromatic could look at....

[13:59] <jnthn> Because it seems to be here for me.

[13:59] <jnthn> masak: Correct.

[14:00] <masak> When is Perl 6 going to stop leaking, dammit? :)

[14:00] <masak> jnthn: and if I want my Str back, what do I do?

[14:00] <jnthn> masak: You get one parameter to postcircumfix:<( )> always, and it's a Capture.

[14:00] <jnthn> masak: 'cus ruoso said so... :-|

[14:00] <masak> ok. ISTR you and pmichaud++ talking about this at YAPC::EU.

[14:00] <jnthn> masak: Just unpack the capture with a sub-signature should work.

[14:01] <masak> kthx

[14:01] <colomon> oh, our monthly release is next week, isn't it?

[14:01] <jnthn> masak: Yeah, I'm still not so fond of this. It feels inconsistent with the way postcircumfix:<[ ]> works for example.

[14:01] <masak> it does.

[14:01] <jnthn> But it was somehow important to the way smop works.

[14:01] <jnthn> colomon: Think so.

[14:04] * jnthn is trying to work out workshop travel plans for the next months...

[14:04] <jnthn> The French and Ukrainian ones completely overlap. :-(

[14:04] <colomon> It's funny: on the one hand, I feel like we've really accomplished something with the ng branch work.  Rakudo is more powerful, and more stable, and easier to work with.

[14:04] <colomon> And on the other hand, there is so much more to do!

[14:05] <masak> who would have thought; new problems lurked around the corner :P

[14:06] <jnthn> colomon: I remember the days when Rakudo was roughly equal to NQP.

[14:06] <jnthn> colomon: There was no OO support at all.

[14:06] <jnthn> colomon: Not even hashes were properly in place.

[14:07] <jnthn> Let alone grammars and regexes and all that goodness.

[14:07] <jnthn> It gives some perspective. :-)

[14:07] <colomon> It feels to me like we're right on the verge of having something that can recommended for general work (of things that don't have to be zippy, anyway ;)

[14:08] <colomon> but it also feels like we've only implemented 50% of everything.  :)

[14:08] <jnthn> Sure. Not everything in the spec is of equal utility or importance.

[14:09] <colomon> I don't mean we've only done half the spec, I mean that we've only half-implemented the stuff we've done.

[14:09] <colomon> I know pretty much every single thing I've worked on could still use more work.

[14:37] <masak> so 'our' would play well with inheritance, right? but not 'my'?

[14:39] <jnthn> Not sure what you mean.

[14:39] <jnthn> That is, I see inheritance and these as pretty orthogonal.

[14:41] <masak> oh, ok.

[14:42] <jnthn> B is a different package to A. You'd not expect those two to have any relation.

[14:42] <masak> ah ok, A and B are separate packages, even though one inherits from the other.

[14:42] <jnthn> Right, but inheritance only means something because the metaclass says it means something.

[14:50] <jnthn> ;-)

[14:50] <jnthn> I also used the duty free to bring some vodka back with me.

[14:50] <jnthn> Less than half the price of what I could get it for here in Sweden.

[14:51] <bacek> And about twice of the price from buying in Russia? :)

[14:52] <jnthn> Yeah. But I'd gone hand luggage only, and you can't take liquids in that. :-(

[14:52] <bacek> stupid "security"...

[14:53] <jnthn> I guess I coulda tried, and offered to drink some of it to show it was really vodka, not explosive. :-)

[14:53] <masak> jnthn: but an 'our' declaration is enough for a variable $x in the class A to be visible to everyone else as $A::x, no?

[14:53] <bacek> .oO( Check-in of 30 kilogrammes of Vodka can be suspicious )

[14:53] <jnthn> bacek: heh, it didn't occur to me that I could use my baggage allowance solely to check in vodka!

[16:26] <colomon> It's suppose to do [2]

[16:27] <colomon> but it just worked fine in the test back there.

[16:27] <masak> colomon: @a[2] is 3 in this case.

[16:28] <colomon> masak: yes, my worry is that there is no Rat or Num case for [ ]

[16:28] <colomon> on Array, anyway.

[16:28] <masak> oh, you're worried that it works :P

[16:28] <colomon> yes, exactly.

[16:29] <colomon> our multi method postcircumfix:<[ ]> (Int $i) seems like the case that is being called, but how / why?

[16:29] <colomon> why does it fail in my code but work on the REPL?

[16:30] <jnthn> I think there's something rotten somewhere in that area of the code, fwiw.

[16:30] <moritz_> is that area of code inside the state of Denmark? :-)

[16:31] <masak> 629 bugs in RT. at this rate, we'll hit 650 next week.

[16:31] * moritz_ updated http://rakudo.org/status

[16:31] <jnthn> masak: Depends on the rate of fixes too.

[16:31] <masak> not really :)

[16:32] <masak> or rather, I took that into account in my estimate.

[16:32] <masak> but sure, consider it a challenge if that helps.

[16:32] *** Alias left
[16:33] <colomon> btw, in this case in my code, casting with .Int fixed the problem.

[16:36] <moritz_> uhm, is that correct?

[16:37] <moritz_> ok, fine

[16:37] <jnthn> moritz_: Signature.perl gets a tad...confused...when there's no name.

[16:37] <jnthn> It's consistent with the other output it gives, fwiw.

[16:37] <jnthn> rakudo: sub foo(:$a) {}; say &foo.signature.perl

[16:37] <p6eval> rakudo 78faa0: OUTPUT«:(Any :a($a))␤»

[16:37] <moritz_> well, as long as the result works, why not?

[16:37] <jnthn> That is, it doesn't collapse it if the variable name matches the parameter name.

[16:38] <jnthn> Probably the guy who wrote Signature.perl was lazy.

[16:38] <TimToady> std parses it as an anonymous named parameter

[16:38] <lue> afk (doctor who)

[16:38] <jnthn> TimToady: So does Rakudo.

[16:38] <colomon> jnthn: you're saying he was a Perl programmer?

[16:38] <jnthn> colomon: Yeah, and he was awesome!

[16:39] <jnthn> Well, the empty-string-named named parameter anyway. :-)

[16:39] * masak still likes the term 'named anonymous (yes I know) parameter'

[16:41] <masak> or was it 'anonymous named'?

[16:42] <jnthn> Anonymous yet named can make sense. :-)

[16:42] <masak> it can. it's just etymologically odd.

[16:43] <moritz_> anonymous named

[16:43] <masak> so is 'atom' nowadays, I guess.

[18:49] <colomon> mberends: I'm afraid it may be.

[18:50] <colomon> which would be bad, as memory usage for this should go up by N, not N^2
