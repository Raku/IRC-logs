[02:24] <colomon> pmichaud: possibly a dumb question; how do we test iterators?

[02:25] <colomon> something like my $a = (1..10).iterator; is $a.get, 1; is $a.get, 2; etc ?

[02:26] <colomon> BTW, perl 6 world, ng now has over 3000 tests turned on again.  :)

[02:34] <eternaleye> \o/

[02:35] <colomon> I reckon we need to turn on about 2000 a day on average for the next week.  :)

[03:45] <LaVolta> colomon, so we must use the braces form to get it interpolated, right?

[03:45] <colomon> That's my understanding.

[04:09] <eternaleye> colomon: LaVolta: Actaully, "@array[]" is supposed to interpolate - it's just NYI. It is, however, true that "@array" does not interpolate.

[04:13] *** jaldhar joined
[04:18] <LaVolta> i just found these lines in RFC 105: [Update: The interpolation rules for arrays have been completely revised. A bare array name no longer interpolates--you have to say @foo[].]

[08:56] <sjohnson> Su-Shee: is German your first language?

[08:56] <Su-Shee> yes.

[08:57] <sjohnson> you speak English quite well... i want to learn German one day, but am afraid it is difficult to learn

[08:58] <Su-Shee> it depends on what you already know. if you by any chance know latin for example or russian, german will be just another one of those kind of languages.. if you know only english, you will hate it from time to time. ;)

[09:00] <sjohnson> i can speak french fluently

[09:00] <sjohnson> and a tiny bit of Japanese

[09:01] <Su-Shee> sjohnson: then go ahead. if you already went through french verbs, german ones aren't that bad. ;)

[09:02] <sjohnson> zer gut, zer gut!

[09:03] <Su-Shee> sjohnson: we do have massive inflection on the nouns as well though. german is just at the beginning to a "de/a" system.

[16:12] <colomon> wow, quiet morning

[16:17] * jnthn has visitor, so has been entertaining today.

[16:27] <colomon> we're still recovering from yesterday here.

[16:27] <jnthn> :-)

[16:27] <colomon> and prepping for my parents to arrive in 3.5 hours.

[16:28] <jnthn> ooh, I needs a Parrot update...

[16:28] * jnthn --gen-parrots

[16:29] <colomon> yay --gen-parrot

[16:31] <colomon> I could tell nobody has been actually hacking on ng this weekend, because I broke the build for about 12 hours yesterday and no one noticed

[16:31] <colomon> (lots of designing going on, of course)

[16:34] <jnthn> hehe

[16:34] <pmichaud> I'm about to do list/iterator refactor in a new branch

[16:34] <pmichaud> (temporary branch)

[16:34] <jnthn> So we're brancing the branch? :-)

[16:35] <pmichaud> yes

[16:35] <jnthn> ;-)

[16:35] <pmichaud> depending on how it goes, should be only for a day

[16:35] <jnthn> ok, wfm

[16:35] <pmichaud> but (as always)  list/array refactors tend to break everything

[16:35] <jnthn> May as well, git makes them a cheap resource. :-)

[16:35] <pmichaud> and it's too big a job to do without some commits/pushes

[16:35] <jnthn> Sure, it's nice to be able to commit bit by bit.

[16:36] <colomon> yay!

[16:36] <jnthn> I might be able to sneak a patch in now before dinner to sort one of my todos. :-)
