[00:59] <tadzik> ingy: it's źblog, actually

[01:01] <timotimo> oh, tadzik is here

[01:01] <timotimo> i was about to test installing patched-panda with patched-panda on parrot

[01:02] <timotimo> apart from taking 3 minutes to do so, it seems to work

[01:02] <timotimo> but rakudo being slow is old news ;)

[01:04] <tadzik> oh, I'm here

[01:04] <timotimo> yeah, it works

[01:04] <tadzik> patched panda, as in donaldh's PR?

[01:05] <timotimo> tadzik: do you want to merge the pr?

[01:05] <timotimo> yes, that's the one

[01:05] <timotimo> exciting times :)

[01:05] <tadzik> sure I do

[01:05] <tadzik> I'd like to test it first though :)

[01:05] <timotimo> i just did

[01:05] <tadzik> preferably on the latest compiler release

[01:05] <timotimo> but go ahead :)

[01:05] <tadzik> I think panda should work on the latest compiler release

[01:05] <timotimo> ah, that's a good point.

[01:05] <timotimo> but that makes it hard, because it needs that patch from rakudo to work - at least on jvm

[01:05] <tadzik> but now I'm drunk and tired, and I'm flying to FRA tomorrow

[01:05] <tadzik> so I think I'll catch some sleep :)

[01:06] <tadzik> patch from rakudo?

[01:06] <timotimo> yes, it's already in

[01:06] <timotimo> but not in the latest compiler release

[01:06] <tadzik> isn't the latest compiler release very soon?

[15:51] <pmurias> timotimo: on the pir level it's an extra argument

[15:51] <timotimo> do i have to invent that extra arg?

[15:51] <krunen> is is the hotel, i'm looking at their card now

[15:51] <timotimo> oh cool

[16:12] <timotimo> i know how to get the hint

[16:13] <timotimo> not how to pass it on to the getattr call that the compiler creates

[16:14] <FROGGS[mobile]> tadzik: you usually have to ask at the receiption

[16:31] <timotimo> so apparently the hint attribute is there for the reprs, but i don't see it in repr_bind_attr and repr_get_attr yet

[16:32] *** araujo left
[16:32] <tadzik> this may mean that I've just lost it :P

[16:33] <timotimo> indeed, the repr_get_attr_... codes just supply NO_HINT, yes

[16:34] <timotimo> if i see it right, i can just add a new candidate that has an additional _i in its name and use IREG(5) to convey the hint?

[16:34] <FROGGS[mobile]> tadzik: no, everything is still open :o)

[16:35] <tadzik> hehe, ok

[16:36] *** araujo joined
[16:36] <timotimo> of *course* there are two versions of each of those already

[16:37] <timotimo> one for a variable string for the name, one for a string constant

[16:37] <timotimo> now we'll have <obj int str num> X <s sc> X <hint nohint>

[16:37] <timotimo> is that sensible? :|

[16:38] <timotimo> and of course get, set and bind, if i see it correctly

[16:40] <timotimo> oh, there's even more combinations than i thought, because there's combinations with integer constants for native int assignment/bind/...

[16:40] <timotimo> i hope nqp_ops.c is autogenerated from some saner format? ;)

[16:42] <tadzik> I think it is

[16:42] <tadzik> from something like .ops

[16:42] <FROGGS[mobile]> from nqp_ops

[16:43] <timotimo> indeed!

[16:43] <FROGGS[mobile]> no, I think it is called nqp_ops

[16:43] <timotimo> apparently it's time to start running

[16:43] <timotimo> nqp.ops exists and is shorter

[20:07] <lue> hello world o/

[20:11] <larks> question, for the concurrency features in Rakudo, it is a waiting on the parrot VM for features or this is really a Rakudo thing?

[20:13] <moritz> larks: I don't understand the question. Can you please try to rephrase?

[20:16] <larks> as in for the (lack of) of concurrency related feature yet to be implemented in Rakudo, are they waiting for VM related things in Parrot or has no one in Rakudo done it yet? 

[20:16] <btyler> larks: rakudo runs on multiple VMs, parrot VM and JVM are the two that currently run. all the cool concurrency stuff is only on the JVM edition of rakudo right now

[20:17] <larks> you know, I think it would just be easy to look at the source code `-`

[20:19] <moritz> larks: parrot implements threads, but it's not really documented how to use them, and so far the attempts to use parrot threads in rakudo weren't very successful

[20:19] <moritz> larks: so us rakudo folks blame parrot, and the parrot folks blame rakudo for not properly implementing threads

[20:19] <moritz> larks: does that answer your question?

[20:20] <larks> yeah, so there's a disconnect so to speak 

[20:23] *** iSlug left
[20:23] <moritz> (it's also a broad oversimplification to say that the parrot developers blame rakudo for not implementing threads; afaict it's only one of them who does, but there aren't that many active parrot developers remaining)

[20:27] <larks> interesting, is it because rakudo starting using the jvm too?

[20:27] <moritz> no

[20:27] <moritz> the decline started long before that

[20:30] <larks> I see.
