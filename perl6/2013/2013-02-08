[00:01] <jnthn> yeah, OK, that bit is :)

[00:02] <jnthn> Maybe I should add a :generic to mark those out.

[00:02] <jnthn> (as in, the ones that are likely generic)

[00:03] <pmurias> if something is generic we should implement it on all vms and avoid QAST::VM

[00:04] <jnthn> In the case of forceouter, yes, it should be an nqp::op implemented everywhere.

[03:46] <swarley> You know you're lazy when you make an executable to add your license header to all of your source files that don't have it

[03:47] <bonsaikitten> swarley: you're not lazy enough when that executable is more than a three-line shell script ;)

[03:48] <swarley> Good point

[03:48] <swarley> https://gist.github.com/swarley/4736308 :p

[03:49] <bonsaikitten> too much work! ;)

[03:49] <swarley> Well I needed a reason to learn more Go anyway ;p

[03:49] <bonsaikitten> I haven't had a motivation yet

[03:50] <bonsaikitten> OpenDylan is distracting me enough

[03:50] <swarley> It's pretty hard to get into learning Go

[03:50] <swarley> But if you get past the top it's actually pretty interesting

[03:51] <swarley> It's compiled but it has garbage collection and polymorphism

[03:51] <rking> Go is the most meh'tastic thing I've seen in a while.

[03:51] <swarley> I'm on the fence about it in a lot of places

[03:51] <rking> There are a few others vying for that title, though. Like Dart.

[03:51] <rking> I think it's got a lot of good engineering for a lot of problems that I don't have.

[03:52] <swarley> What is PAWN doing?

[03:52] <bonsaikitten> rking: that describes most "innovation" 

[03:52] <swarley> I have no idea what the hell PAWN even is really. It looks like C to me based on the hello world

[03:52] <rking> The one I'm waiting for an excuse to learn is in the channel name.

[03:53] <rking> I still don't know how it'll fit into my "Used to use Perl5, use/like Ruby, dream of Smalltalk" world.

[03:53] <swarley> lol. I use nqp more than I use perl6 tbh

[03:53] <bonsaikitten> similar for me

[03:53] <bonsaikitten> I just think it's still an interesting experiment and package it for gentoo

[03:54] <swarley> PAWN seems like a stupid language

[03:54] <bonsaikitten> ... like OpenDylan, OpenCOBOL, J and a few others

[03:54] <swarley> like exactly the same syntax as C

[03:54] <swarley> but it's scripted..

[03:55] <swarley> I don't know, nothing I would be motivated to use

[03:55] <swarley> I'd learn lua before any other new language

[03:56] <swarley> I still have C#, Perl6 to completeness (NQP included), and Go to finish learning

[03:56] <bonsaikitten> swarley: as far as I can tell lua has some nice ideas, but is too much manual work

[03:56] <bonsaikitten> not sure if it's that useful ... but it seems to make lots of people happy

[03:56] <swarley> I like the fact that Lua is embedded easily

[03:56] <swarley> But I'm iffy on the syntax

[03:58] <bonsaikitten> yes, but it doesn't have any proper refcounting / GC as far as I remember

[03:58] <bonsaikitten> so it's very easy to get it wrong

[03:59] <swarley> Ah. That's something that drew me into Go

[03:59] <bonsaikitten> for me python covers most of that, and if I need things to be faster it's usually C

[03:59] <swarley> They have a concurrent mark-sweep GC added in with the goal of minimal overhead

[03:59] <bonsaikitten> with shell and perl5 covering the glue between things

[04:00] <swarley> Yeah, I use ruby when speed isn't an issue, C extensions for ruby when its only a desire, and C++/C when it's a necessity

[04:00] <swarley> I prefer not to do large projects in C though. It feels like the code gets unruly quickly

[04:00] <bonsaikitten> yes

[04:01] <bonsaikitten> takes lots of discipline to keep it nice

[04:01] <bonsaikitten> re: ruby, my brain can't parse it, it's just "wrong" in every aspect - plus the ecosystem is filled with bad code, bad advice and bad behaviour (who needs releases lol)

[04:02] <swarley> ?

[04:02] <swarley> Please elaborate, I'm a fairly active member of the community and we don't really try to give bad advice

[04:02] <swarley> same for rking 

[04:03] <swarley> I usually feel a lot less anxiety about asking a question in #ruby than i do in #perl

[04:03] <bonsaikitten> well, most of the documentation I tend to stumble over is random blog posts

[04:03] <geekosaur> ruby:  bastard child of perl 5 and smalltalk.  obj-c knowledge might help some...

[04:03] <swarley> Ah. Well it depends on what you're looking up.

[04:03] <swarley> If it's the standard library, that's all documented and hosted on the same server

[04:03] <bonsaikitten> swarley: there are some pretty smart people in the ruby cloud, and lots of people that found php too difficult and never figured out basic sanity checks

[04:04] <swarley> If it's a 3rd party gem, that's up to the developer

[04:04] <swarley> oh god, yes that pisses me off

[04:04] <bonsaikitten> but that's the added value, a module for everything

[04:04] <rking> "Ruby is if Smalltalk and Lisp had a love child, but left it in the care of its nanny, Perl."

[04:04] <bonsaikitten> well, at least they don't do error handling a la php - print a message to stdout *headdesk*

[04:04] <swarley> I think there is a quote of me somewhere actually telling someone to "crawl back into the hole their frightened PHP emerged from"

[04:04] <bonsaikitten> that's not how you handle errors :(

[04:05] <geekosaur> the ruby community has some very good guidelines for how to handle versioning... which are not merely ignored but actively violated by most gem developers

[04:05] <swarley> What? Module for everything?

[04:05] <swarley> I think you're confusing good ruby with common ruby ;)

[04:06] *** dwoldrich joined
[04:07] <swarley> Not to say, that I myself even write good ruby. In fact, I would say I'm about lower level advanced. So, not that special. I just keep my mouth shut when I see people coming in doing $i = 5; $i.times {|x| x += $i } and don't yell at them to at least read chapter one of any tutorial

[04:16] <dwoldrich> Hey perl6 guys, I think Parrot was a great idea, I was hoping to see it succeed, am sad you all turned your backs on the project, and I think it's silly to target the JVM or invest man hours in it.

[04:17] <dwoldrich> Just because the JVM can execute JVM bytecode faster than Parrot byte codes TODAY, doesn't make that so in the future.  If you recall, the JVM was a sloth up until around JDK 1.5 or so.

[04:18] <dwoldrich> And Oracle is going to tank the JVM, why oh why would you board a leaky, if not sinking, ship??

[04:20] <dwoldrich> Parrot should have been your glittering jewel, not Perl6.  Parrot could have had legs, 20 year lifespan, developers and business porting AWAY from the JVM!

[04:20] <sorear> dwoldrich: I think you have never tried to use Parrot

[04:21] <dwoldrich> I am not saying that Parrot, or Perl6, were the best run or designed projects.

[04:21] <dwoldrich> But what I am saying is, the vision was right on

[04:21] <dwoldrich> If only you all could come together and be one team

[04:22] <dwoldrich> not sure why the "throw it over the wall" deal existed

[04:22] <sorear> hahahahaha

[04:23] <dwoldrich> You just never saw yourself as competition with JVM, and that saddens me, because right around the time Parrot hit 1.0, the obsolescence and design cruft was setting in on the JVM

[04:23] <dwoldrich> I watched the changelogs and was like, what the heck is the goal here?

[04:23] <bonsaikitten> dwoldrich: the JVM has a lot more manpower behind it, so it won't just disappear

[04:24] <bonsaikitten> and just because someone experiments doesn't mean that everyone abandons their current project

[04:24] <dwoldrich> you all said Parrot's dead

[04:25] <dwoldrich> I'll take you at your word

[04:25] <bonsaikitten> "all" ? pfff.

[04:25] <bonsaikitten> you must be a journalist

[04:26] <dwoldrich> no, not even a perl developer

[04:26] <dwoldrich> I'm a Java developer

[04:26] <dwoldrich> and I don't like what I'm seeing in the java community

[04:26] <dwoldrich> looking for options now

[04:26] <sorear> you sound like a regular contributor to [email@hidden.address]

[04:43] <dwoldrich> again, let me present, Parrot.

[04:43] <dwoldrich> or the Parrot that could be

[04:43] <geekosaur> and let me repeat "nonsucky"

[04:43] <dwoldrich> Make it so.

[04:43] <geekosaur> consideringt he amount of times I see rakudo having to work around the parrot internals thrashing...

[04:43] <dwoldrich> I demand a non-sucky Parrot immediately

[04:44] <rindolf> dwoldrich: a VM is any interpreter or CPU.

[04:44] <geekosaur> well, bully foryou

[04:44] <rindolf> dwoldrich: even perl 4 was a VM.

[04:44] <rindolf> dwoldrich: and Perl 5 has a VM too.

[04:58] <sorear> dwoldrich: anyway, if you want parrot to become usable, take it to #parrot on irc.perl.net

[04:59] <sorear> *irc.perl.org

[05:00] <dwoldrich> rindolf: I like the idea of Parrot.  As I understand it, it didn't have a stable bytecode, and thus required a source language to feed it parrot assembly code, which to me makes it a non-starter.  A VM should be responsible for verifying, loading, and running bytecodes, very well-specified bytecodes.

[05:06] <swarley> It just doesn't seem wise to use a VM still being made stable with a language still waiting for a first full implementation 

[05:06] <swarley> Let me clarify

[05:06] <swarley> A VM with the aims of parrot

[05:06] <dwoldrich> swarley: that

[05:06] <dwoldrich> that's a good point

[05:06] <dwoldrich> But I think a byte code specification

[05:06] <dwoldrich> iron clad

[05:07] <dwoldrich> would have smoothed out a lot of wrinkles

[05:07] <sorear> dwoldrich: we have no influence on parrot whatsoever here.

[05:07] <sorear> they do whatever they please.

[05:07] <sorear> if you want to be part of the parrot decision process, join #parrot on irc.perl.org

[05:07] <sorear> sorry.

[05:07] <dwoldrich> Yeah, I detect your frustration

[05:09] *** SamuraiJack joined
[05:09] <dwoldrich> I think because parrot is yoked to perl6, though, your (perceived/real) abandonment of that project gives the impression that it is doomed.

[05:09] <dwoldrich> and if you're not going to do your own parrot fork

[05:10] <swarley> Parrot isn't really bound to perl6

[05:10] <dwoldrich> then, let's all hope Oracle is a nice steward of the heart that pumps the blood through our veins.  :/

[05:11] <dwoldrich> I think it is

[05:11] <swarley> Parrot is independent entirely of perl6

[05:12] <dwoldrich> It wasn't always

[05:12] <swarley> Without perl 6 parrot could still go on, its popularity is just to be determined by how well they can get it working

[05:12] <swarley> I really don't understand your logic 

[05:12] <swarley> The way I understand it

[05:12] <swarley> Parrot is an all purpose vm

[05:12] <dwoldrich> The flagship for Parrot was Perl6, it was billed as being an engine flexible enough to be a target for that language

[05:13] <dalek> ecosystem: 92886d4 | colomon++ | META.list:

[05:13] <dalek> ecosystem: Remove obsolete Math::Prime from the ecosystem.

[05:13] <dalek> ecosystem: review: https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/commit/92886d4a0f

[05:13] <dwoldrich> Without the flagship, how will it know which way to sail?

[05:13] <swarley> Uh, it seems to be doing much better with jvm and cil based on benchmarks

[05:14] <sorear> dwoldrich: you seem to have heard very precious little of the news from the last five years

[05:14] <dwoldrich> this is true

[05:14] <dwoldrich> I don't soak in Perl news

[05:14] <dwoldrich> But I am interested!

[05:15] <swarley> Then you may want to start by finding out that parrot is almost completely removed from nqp i believe

[05:15] <sorear> then I should tell you that #perl6 is now a place where we care about things that work

[05:15] <dwoldrich> I just want to say that I believe the JVM, knowing what I know about the jvm byte codes and the new stuff in JDK 7, could be a fast execution engine for Perl6

[05:16] <sorear> we've banished all the people with revolutionary fantasies

[05:16] <swarley> Okay?.. that's what nqp-jvm is for

[05:17] <dwoldrich> if, at the end of the day, all objects were just hashmaps to function pointers and values, it would still work pretty fast

[05:17] <dwoldrich> right

[05:17] <dwoldrich> I'm saying, that that course is going to perform okay, so-so, maybe fast in very specific scenarios where you can do more with dynamicinvoke on JDK7

[05:18] <swarley> I think the main goal here is to have it just work

[05:18] <swarley> And then we worry about speed later after everything works

[05:18] * geekosaur thinks the chanel has been rather successfully trolled...

[05:18] <dwoldrich> Right

[05:18] <dwoldrich> Not a bad plan

[05:19] <sorear> geekosaur: do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity

[05:19] <sorear> although I would use a gentler word than stupidity

[05:19] <dwoldrich> I'm just saying Parrot, as a long term visionary, we can host the world's code thing, is a better plan

[05:19] <swarley> Lol'd

[05:19] <dwoldrich> don't be smug

[05:19] <dwoldrich> I'm trying to be helpful

[05:20] <lue> One advantage of JVM over parrot right now is that more people use JVM and JVM is (probably) more trusted, especially in business settings.

[05:20] <swarley> Parrot, as of this moment, gives rakudo a reputation of a terribly slow and unusable interpreter

[05:21] <dwoldrich> yeah, at some point someone said, this thing is unworkable, I bet

[05:21] <swarley> Not functionally, just resource and speed

[05:21] <geekosaur> you missed some of the earlier stuff

[05:21] <geekosaur> [07 23:42] <dwoldrich> I demand a non-sucky Parrot immediately

[05:21] <dwoldrich> :)

[05:21] <dwoldrich> I thought that was funny!

[05:21] <swarley> Then go bitch to them about it

[05:22] *** xinming_ left
[05:22] <dwoldrich> You don't share my vision, then?

[05:22] <lue> dwoldrich: Are you aware of the existing effort to put nqp (and as a result rakudo) on the JVM?

[05:22] <swarley> No, I think parrot is a marvelous idea.

[05:22] <dwoldrich> JVM byte codes are last century, man

[05:22] <swarley> However

[05:22] <swarley> Wasting time with it right now is pointless

[05:22] <dwoldrich> fair enough

[05:22] * geekosaur would quote more backscroll but doesn't see the point

[05:23] <dwoldrich> perhaps, when Perl 6 settles out 

[05:23] <dwoldrich> and when JVM is a good performing target

[05:23] <swarley> Perl6 isn't the problem

[05:23] <dwoldrich> we can revisit the parrot thing

[05:23] <dwoldrich> Oh, I think Perl6 is part of the problem

[05:23] *** xinming joined
[05:23] <swarley> Parrot is the problem

[05:23] <dwoldrich> your team is problematic

[05:24] <dwoldrich> design churn, rewrites, replatforming

[05:24] <dwoldrich> c'mon

[05:24] <sorear> you come in here and immediately act like you own the place

[05:24] <sorear> and failing.

[05:24] <sorear> epically.

[05:24] <swarley> I would hardly call the team problematic

[05:24] <swarley> Things are done with careful consideration

[05:25] <swarley> I'm not even on the team, I'm just here because I admire them

[05:25] <lue> dwoldrich: about the rewrites: http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/2012-stop-the-rewrites.html

[05:25] <sorear> dwoldrich treats the JVM thing as some spur-of-the-moment decision

[05:25] <dwoldrich> I don't know, can't say.  Just know by the news stories I read

[05:25] <sorear> we spent more than a year on that

[05:25] <sorear> so don't pretend you can make a difference

[05:25] <sorear> unless you want to spend a year arguing your point of view

[05:26] <au> swarley: nqp-go is a fabulous idea, I'd love to see it.

[05:26] <swarley> I think that using go routines would be a nifty optimization for certain areas

[05:26] <swarley> Concurrency without having to do anything special

[05:27] <au> *nod*

[05:27] <dwoldrich> lue: I have read that story before, is it inaccurate?

[05:27] <swarley> I started writing some type definitions for the objects, its a lot more readable than I expected it to be

[05:28] <au> yup.

[05:28] <au> ...and when an implementor learns, we all learn :)

[05:28] <swarley> I think its a plausible idea, I plan to give it some more work over the following week and see where it leads.

[05:28] <lue> no, it's right. The part I take away from it is that sometimes rewrites are necessary (and also the last three subsystem rewrites didn't break everything)

[05:28] <au> swarley++

[05:29] <swarley> And since it has its own garbage collector and all of that fun stuff, no mess in that area. So I think its a reasonable candidate

[05:32] <au> swarley: there's some early work (not quite nqp, but similar) at https://github.com/fglock/Perlito/blob/master/src6/lib/Perlito6/Go/Emitter.pm which may be informative if not dircetly reusable

[05:32] <swarley> Oh. What license is nqp/rakudo under? 

[05:32] <sorear> artistic 2, isn't it?

[05:32] <au> Artistic 2.

[05:32] <swarley> Thanks au, I'll take a read

[05:33] <sorear> OTOH we have the CLA stuff to deal with

[05:33] <sorear> we'd need to get a signed attestation from fglock that that code is usable

[05:35] <swarley> Alright,  I wanted to make sure before I added any code to my repo so that I could change my license, the one I have in there now is MPL

[05:36] <au> swarley: as long as you're the sole author you can always change the license at any point :)

[05:36] * au has bypassed this CLA & license compatibility business just by using CC0 for everything :p

[05:37] <swarley> Yup, I almost never have help on my projects. So I tend to jump around occasionally from GPL to MPL

[05:37] <moritz> \o morning

[05:37] <sorear> o/ moritzning

[05:38] <japhb> swarley, IANAL, but for the Perl 6 community, if you're not going to go au++'s route of CC0, you might consider Artistic 2.  You'll find it probably the most common Perl 6 license, and it is GPL-compatible.

[05:39] <moritz> what's CCO? Creative COmmons?

[05:39] <japhb> http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

[05:40] <lue> Beefier public domain, IIRC

[05:40] <moritz> woah, quite permissive

[05:41] <au> ensured compatibility

[05:43] *** Naga left
[05:44] <japhb> au, are you still active in the Perl 5 community?

[05:45] <japhb> (I spend most of my "community time" here, so I've kindof lost touch with who's who on the Perl 5 side of late ...)

[05:45] <au> japhb: I still maintain some of the modules and pull reqs from time to time.

[05:45] <japhb> Fair enough.

[05:45] <swarley> I just read Artistic 2, I think I like that the most out of any so far

[05:46] <au> swarley++ # awesome

[05:46] <swarley> That's a really good licensing strategy

[05:47] <swarley> And I'm assuming that applies to your code as a whole, so no header?

[05:47] <japhb> I'm looking at building a list of modules and functionality that should be higher-priority for us to port from Perl 5, and I'm looking for good ways to figure out what people are relying on and is considered relatively state of the art.

[05:48] <sorear> what does au do these days?

[05:48] <japhb> The first thing that occurred to me was the CPAN 100: Volatile 100, which lists most-depended-on modules.

[05:48] <japhb> But that ends up being a lot of testing and low-level infrastructure.

[05:48] <sorear> .oO( Task::Weaken )

[05:48] <moritz> swarley: IANAL, but I think the common stance is that using a header file or a Perl module isn't a derivative work, so you can do it in any project

[05:50] <japhb> sorear, Oh yeah, I'd seen that one before, but forgotten about it, since I didn't happen to need it.  Annoying as heck that someone had to go and do that, though.

[05:52] <swarley> So just a COPYING and LICENSE file at the root would do?

[05:52] <au> sorear: differs from week to week. last week was mostly hacking with folks on g0v.tw ( http://g0v.tw/about.html ) to build a unicode chinese-chinese dictionary by scraping government data with legacy encoding.

[05:52] <japhb> Anyway, I'm looking for suggestions of places to investigate.  Clearly things like the Perl 5 core modules, common sense stuff like DBI, modules that are packaged under lots of Linux distros and/or Strawberry Perl ...

[05:53] <au> sorear: after a hackathon with 200ish folks, there's a longish list of repos in http://3du.tw/ with ports that covers pretty much all the mainstream development platforms, including http://moedict.tw/ :)

[05:53] <au> sorear: and it'll be something entirely different next week, likely.

[05:58] <au> japhb: modules that are in Strawberry or ActivePerl but not in Perl Core is a good list to start imvho.

[05:59] <japhb> au, thank you, good point.

[05:59] <sorear> japhb: Task::BeLike::DOY?

[05:59] <au> it's one of your points, I just highlighted that particular one :p

[06:00] <japhb> au: Nodnod, I meant, good interpretation/angle on it.  I was thinking about comparing across packaging systems, as opposed to diffing the Windows ones against core.

[06:01] <japhb> sorear, Hmmm, interesting.  Anyone else that did that whose taste you trust?

[06:02] <sorear> metacpan knows about rafl, rjbs, and sartak

[06:02] <sorear> I don't know any of the others

[06:03] <sorear> (i.e. I don't know avar very well)

[06:03] <sorear> (also note: rafl is spelled FLORA on cpahn)

[06:03] <japhb> Thank you, sorear

[06:04] <sorear> it's probably not a coincidence that this set of people overlaps strongly with the moose core team

[06:05] <japhb> Moose-ers seem to be more likely to be CPANers.  :-)

[13:09] *** crab2313 left
[13:09] <tadzik> because it can happen

[13:09] <tadzik> and I'd rather if we know what happens when someone tries

[13:10] <pmurias> an exception should be thrown?

[13:10] <tadzik> existspos works for negative, for example

[13:10] <tadzik> Just Works [tm]

[13:11] <pmurias> by testing stupid usage you force all the implementations to implement it

[13:11] <pmurias> and make it seems acceptable for users to depend on it

[13:13] <tadzik> it didn't have tests before, and no one really knows how is it actually used

[13:13] <nwc10> what *is* using it? ie - if you locally change it to throw an exception, how many tests fail?

[13:13] <tadzik> so I prefered to replicate Parrot as closely as possible, and _have_ tests for that

[13:13] <masak> wait, in what way does it just work?

[13:13] <tadzik> what, existspos?

[13:13] <masak> either of them.

[13:13] <tadzik> nwc10: we'll never know until we check with Rakudo

[13:13] <masak> I agree that it's not a good idea to support negative positions out-of-the-box.

[13:13] <nwc10> that is what I mean.

[13:13] <tadzik> existspos counts from the back, like *-n

[13:13] <nwc10> change it locally, rebuild rakudo, run the spectests

[13:13] <nwc10> what fails?

[13:14] <tadzik> deletepos removes the 0th element, always

[13:14] <masak> it's internal leakage like that that causes hard-to-predict bugs up at the user level.

[13:14] <masak> yeah, I don't like it.

[13:14] <tadzik> well, feel free to change it

[13:14] <masak> I'm at $dayjob.

[13:14] <masak> but if no-one has done it by tomorrow, I will.

[13:14] <nwc10> answer that, and you get to a pretty good idea of what (if anything) in the compiler need to change to avoid it

[13:14] <tadzik> I've been reimplementing Parrot opcodes in Java, I wanted them to work alike, especially because they're not tested

[13:15] <masak> nwc10: anything that does use it should be changed, too :)

[13:15] <tadzik> well, maybe they're tested in Parrot

[13:15] <masak> it's good that we have tests for it.

[13:15] <masak> it's bad that we accept silly inputs.

[13:15] <nwc10> parrot opcodes directly? rather than something related to NQP and the JVM prototype?

[13:16] <tadzik> nwc10: nqp::opcodes. Which were directly mapped to pir::opcodes

[13:16] <nwc10> ah OK

[13:16] <nwc10> I still think the answer is to figure out whether NQP is even using the behaviour

[13:16] <pmurias> it's not used by rakudo and nqp at all (according to ack)

[13:17] <tadzik> look, maybe it's even better than they're changed. I didn't have any strong opinion, and wasn't really trying to come up with one. The task was "implement nqp::existpos and nqp::deletepos on JVM". I did. The same way that they works

[13:17] <pmurias> the opcode itself

[13:17] <tadzik> * worked

[13:17] <nwc10> oh, right. OK

[13:17] <tadzik> I found the usage in rakudo, fwiw

[13:17] <masak> jnthn says that existspos and deletepos are used in so few places, that "we don't need to worry [about the change being breaking] in this case".

[13:17] <tadzik> at least existspos

[13:17] <pmurias> tadzik: I'm not really blaming you, I just want to avoid porting crazy parrot behavior

[13:18] <tadzik> and I have mixed feelings about deletepos anyway

[13:31] <masak> pmurias++

[13:31] <tadzik> don't know about nqp, but on JVM we keep a constant value in QRPA which says how many elements are there

[13:31] <tadzik> it probably needs to be updated when we set Mu somewhere

[13:32] *** PZt joined
[13:32] <moritz> the problem is that if you delete an element that's not the last, it set to Mu

[13:32] <moritz> because we don't have an offchannel way to store an array element as deleted

[13:32] <pmurias> no

[13:33] <moritz> no?

[13:33] <tadzik> we have to settle of something: do we count the number of defined elements in the array, or do we count "the longest streak" of elements?

[13:33] <pmurias> the problem is that if you delete the last element all the undefined elements before it get deletedf

[13:36] <pmurias> the spec seems to hold an distinction between elements that aren't in an array and those that are set to an undefined value

[13:50] <tadzik> it's a mixture of 2 jokes

[13:50] <nwc10> It's not a good thing to copy. Sparse arrays should be sparse

[13:50] <nwc10> and normal arrays not

[13:50] <tadzik> 2) I've got 99 problems but bitches ain't one

[13:51] <masak> tadzik: yes, I knew both of those.

[15:47] <masak> aye.

[15:47] <[Coke]> A thought about parrot vs. perl6, btw. I'd like to see both projects succeed, but I don't think that in order for either to succeed, the other must, and I don't think it's reasonable that tuits spent on one project are fungible to the other.

[15:48] <arnsholt> The idea that tuits are fungible in general annoys me alot

[15:48] <arnsholt> s/alot/a lot/

[15:49] <[Coke]> I'm not suggesting that's the cause of any current discussion issues, but I've seen it historically. (when hacking on partcl, e.g. I often wanted to USE parrot, not figure out how to fix it.)

[15:49] <arnsholt> There are so many reasons why a person decides to spend his spare time on a particular project, most of them probably non-technical, that it's hard to see them as fungible in any sensible way I think

[15:49] <[Coke]> jvm/nqp... aye. I keep meaning to catch up and then there's 50 more commits.

[16:22] <benabik> One's plural?

[16:22] <pmurias> me found the difference in the docs

[16:22] <benabik> I think Stmt is designed to limit things like temporary generation for a single statement, while Stmts is a sequence of code.  (Someone else can probably explain better.)

[18:04] <uvtc> n/m

[18:05] <[Coke]> it was experimental years ago.

[18:05] <uvtc> understood

[18:05] <uvtc> thanks

[18:05] <uvtc> If someone wants to port Rakudo to another backend, what are the main pieces involved?

[18:06] <benabik> QAST, rules engine, and REPRs?

[18:06] <uvtc> Are those all parts of nqp?

[18:06] <[Coke]> uvtc: port nqp.

[18:06] <benabik> uvtc: Yes.

[18:06] <uvtc> Cool. Thanks.

[18:06] <PerlJam> uvtc: what other backend are you thinking about porting it to?

[18:07] *** benabik left
[18:07] <uvtc> I am not. But a few days ago someone (pmurias?) mentioned that maybe Perl 6 could use an "Implementations FAQ". So I'm quickly writing up something for the wiki, and asking questions now as I type.

[18:07] <FROGGS> nqp is the "glue language", but there are still some parrot specific thing in rakudo itself (I'm thinking of IO::Socket::INET)

[18:07] *** SamuraiJack joined
[18:08] <FROGGS> ++uvtc

[18:08] <au> tail_: try "cabal install Pugs --flags=-Perl5" to install without Perl5 bindings. it's possible your perl installation had no compatible EXTERN.h

[18:09] <au> cabal should actually retry that... not sure if Pugs.cabal can be tweaked to make that happen. pull requests welcome :)

[18:09] <au> -> zz for real &

[18:09] <uvtc> REPRs == regexes?

[18:09] <PerlJam> uvtc: no

[18:09] <uvtc> What are REPRs?

[18:10] *** SmokeMachine left
[18:10] <uvtc> Sounds like something one would catch down by the river and fry up under the stars over a campfire.

[18:10] <PerlJam> uvtc: REPRs are the "clostest to the metal" representation of things.

[18:10] *** arlinius left
[18:10] <geekosaur> cabal doesn't so much try things, in the sense of try the compile and then try it again on fail.  it's just a constraint solver and if you can't describe the constraint directly in the cabal file (as when you need to do configure search for perl5 guts) you can't have it automatically set that flag

[18:18] <tail_> It works!

[21:05] <tadzik> they're close enough :)

[21:06] <masak> jnthn: where does the adverb go?

[21:06] <jnthn> masak: There seems OK to me... :)

[21:07] <jnthn> masak: Though I'm pretty sure it coulda gone on the end too.

[21:07] <masak> so typical of a cased language. they don't really care :P

[21:08] <arnsholt> jnthn: From the error message I get compiling, it looks like Rakudo tries to serialize an object NQP doesn't like?

[21:08] <masak> Latin is worse, though. they flaunt their nonchalance of word order.

[21:08] <jnthn> Well, just means you get to use word order for nuance. :)

[21:09] <jnthn> I never got to the level of being able to do that terribly well in Slovak. Maybe I will with $slavic_language.next :)

[21:10] <tadzik> Bulgarian is cool :)

[21:10] <jnthn> No, but I'd like to make an effort to learn one of the languages from that sub-family.

[21:11] <masak> tadzik: it is, actually.

[21:11] <timotimo> it is basically advanced Russian, no?

[21:12] <jnthn> Russian often feels like pretty advanced Russian to me :P

[21:12] <timotimo> would evolved be a better term?

[21:12] <masak> timotimo: not really.

[21:14] <swarley> I cannot seem to answer this physics problem

[21:15] *** cognominal__ joined
[21:15] <[Coke]> does it involve pushing on a rope

[21:15] <[Coke]> ?

[21:15] <masak> :P

[21:15] <swarley> No :( electrostatics

[21:15] *** cognominal left
[21:16] <masak> swarley: I always get static shocks from a metal staircase in a $work building... ;)

[21:16] <masak> that's also a physics problem, I think.

[21:16] <jnthn> hah, I was thinking exactly the same :)

[21:16] <masak> jnthn: that's because you get them too! :P

[21:17] <jnthn> I think that's a problem of them using a HUGE piece of iron, then people rubbing their huge winter coats against it :)

[21:17] <jnthn> The glass stairs probably also don't help... :)

[21:17] <swarley> Two point charges, q1 and q2 are placed 0.30m apart on the x-axis, as show in the figure above. Charge q1 has a value of -3e-9 C. The net electric field at point P is zero. Calculate the magnitude and charge of q2.

[21:17] <masak> swarley: where's point P?

[21:18] <swarley> 0.1m left of point q1

[21:18] <masak> yes, then it's solvable.

[21:18] <[Coke]> hey, don't we have a community rule about not doing people's homework? ;)

[21:18] <masak> I didn't give him the solution! :P

[21:18] <tadzik> physics? Do help him :)

[21:18] <TimToady> since it's really just electromagnetism...

[21:18] <tadzik> I remember my struggle with physics

[21:18] <jnthn> -3e-9 C...that's some really cold weather.

[21:18] <swarley> I thought I got the value for q2, but in theory if I got it right then if I calculate it the electric field should be zero

[21:18] <moritz> masak: re paranoia: possible

[21:18] <swarley> but it's 0.000005

[21:19] <masak> jnthn: with wind chill, it's 20 degrees below absolute zero!

[21:19] <uvtc> swarley: figure out the field at P due to q1.

[21:19] <masak> yeah, uvtc has it. field.total = field.q1 + field.q2

[21:20] <swarley> uvtc; I started with Eq1 = Eq2 then culoumbs law, k(-3e-9)/(0.1)^2 = k(q2)/(0.4)^2

[21:20] <swarley> k cancels, simplify etc

[21:20] <swarley> I came down to 4.8e-8 nC

[21:20] <swarley> err

[21:21] <swarley> -nC

[21:21] <swarley> But if I try to prove that with the electric field equaling zero it doesn't turn out as expected

[21:21] <uvtc> Eq1 = -Eq2

[21:22] <swarley> Electric field of q1 must be equal and opposite of q2 at point P

[21:22] <swarley> since they cancel

[21:23] <swarley> Jesus, you don't need to take a standard physics class before AP physics they said, he's only a little bit of a hard teacher they said

[21:23] <uvtc> hahaha

[21:23] <swarley> Seriously, his motto is "If I make it harder than the exam, you won't have any problems"

[21:24] <masak> I like him already.

[21:24] <moritz> swarley: just remember that the electric field decreases quadratically with distance

[21:24] <swarley> I know, because of radius squared

[21:24] <swarley> Inverse proportionality

[21:24] <swarley> inverse square*

[21:24] <moritz> so you just have to square the ratio of distances to get the ratio of charges to make them cancel out

[21:24] <swarley> but that doesn't change that they cancel

[21:25] <swarley> ohh

[21:25] <masak> it feels to me that you need to plug your values into the same equation twice: the one that relates point charge, electric field, and distance.

[21:25] <masak> I would even write up a nice solution in Perl 6, if I could think of a nice way to run the same formula both backwards and forwards :)

[21:26] <masak> hrm, I guess I could just implement both directions...

[21:26] <arnsholt> Maybe we need a computer algebra system O:)

[21:27] <swarley> I have one, I really do love math, so I spoiled myself to a TI-Nspire CX CAS

[21:27] <swarley> with a*

[21:27] * moritz was good as physics as long as constant factors could be ignored :-)

[21:27] <swarley> I'm good with physics 2 weeks after the unit has finished. It's just that our teacher assumes that we have taken calculus already

[21:28] <swarley> And I'm a calculus student stuck in a trig students curriculum..

[21:29] <swarley> Oh man, seeing vectors for the first time in kinematics, that was not even a learning curve

[21:29] <swarley> That was a learning wall

[21:45] <arnsholt> jnthn: Right. I'll provisionally blame myself, in that case

[21:45] <masak> in this case, the constant factors could be ignored. :)

[21:45] <jnthn> arnsholt: Well, doing a built of before any of the merging for now

[21:46] <jnthn> That should help answer it

[21:46] <arnsholt> Yeah, definitely

[21:46] <masak> swarley: basically all I'm using in the end is "it's an inverse square law -- if it's twice the distance, the charge needs to go up by a factor of sqrt(2)"

[21:46] <swarley> Yeah, I understand it now. I just was caught up in a slur of variables

[21:47] <jnthn> arnsholt: Hm, seems not...

[21:47] <masak> the trick to solving these problems is to abstract away the unnecessary parts :)

[21:47] <swarley> I swear I'm not bad at physics, I got one of the headers

[21:47] <swarley> errr

[21:47] <swarley> Harder ones

[21:47] <swarley> Sorry, someone asked me a question as I was typing

[21:47] <arnsholt> jnthn: No error pre-merge, or error pre-merge?

[21:47] <jnthn> arnsholt: Error pre-merge. Very odd.

[21:48] <masak> swarley: don't spend time classifying yourself. just practice the problems until they feel easy :)

[21:48] <moritz> swarley: http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/51157269.9f7.1a4 # there's the math, formally

[21:48] <swarley> I got one of the variable only ones 100% correct and I was so excited lol. Those usually have the lowest average points earned

[21:49] <masak> er, moritz is right, I'm wrong.

[21:49] <masak> the factor is -4, not -sqrt(2). of course.

[21:50] <arnsholt> jnthn: Weird, weird

[21:58] <jnthn> Array.delete in Perl 6.

[21:58] *** cognominal left
[21:58] <jnthn> Though I wonder if we couldn't instead use splice or something...

[21:59] <pmurias> it's not used in rakudo atm

[22:00] <pmurias> jnthn: a few people were unsure if we want to keep the current Array.delete behavior

[22:01] <pmurias> jnthn: as it's copied over deprecated perl5 behavior

[22:01] <masak> moritz: well, it looks that way. Wikipedia says that Coloumb's law and Gauss' law are equivalent.

[22:01] <moritz> masak: yes, just very different formulations

[22:02] <masak> I'm looking at the math and realizing that I've forgotten too much of this to easily take it in.

[22:28] *** donaldh left
[22:29] <rurban> I'm trying to design a better perl macro system. `statements` looks better than quasi{statements} or {{{statements}}}. qx should be used instead of `` for systems commands. macro declaration arguments should be possible structures ("destructuring-bind"), scalar, lists ie. () or hashes i.e. blocks. See e.g. http://perl11.org/p2/p2-extensions.html

[22:30] <rurban> @`` for late evaluation in list-context.

[22:34] <flussence> I wouldn't complain if shell-`` went away - I can never remember what function it maps to...

[22:35] <tadzik> shell `` is gone

[22:35] <masak> rurban: by the use of 'expr' and 'block' there, are you conflating rule names with parameter names?

[22:35] <flussence> oh well, you didn't see me complain :)

[22:36] <pmurias> rurban: it would be great to be able to specify the language for quasi quotes

[22:36] <rurban> well, {block} could be matching a lexed block or a hash

[22:36] <masak> rurban: what exactly can occur within the `` ?

[22:37] <rurban> I want to be able to matcbh both, blocks or hashes (of hashes). That's where I'm currently struggling

[22:37] <rurban> (in lisp it was much easier)

[22:38] <masak> rurban: it doesn't say {block} on that page, it says '{'block'}'

[22:38] <rurban> That's why I'm thinking a macro definition should have the same definition as in the parser definition. parsed at compile-time. macro while '('expr')' '{'block'}' {...}

[22:38] <masak> rurban: I find the syntax confusing. things are not marked out as rules in any way.

[22:39] <rurban> {block} might want to match a hash key named block

[22:39] <rurban> confusing, yes

[22:40] <masak> rurban: ah, well. looks like the beginning of something, but I don't see it working as-is.

[22:40] <masak> what if you wanted a macro with two blocks in it?

[22:40] <masak> like a loop with a continue block, for example?

[22:40] <pmurias> wouldn't it make sense to optimize for clarity, and not for conciseness

[22:41] <masak> pmurias: yes. the kind of clarity that makes things stand out.

[22:41] <rurban> I'd need a public API for the lexer, so that the structural macro arguments are well defined.

[22:41] <masak> pmurias: that's why we have {{{$ast}}} currently. it stands out.

[22:52] <PerlJam> swarley: you're making a Go backend for rakudo?

[22:52] <swarley> nqp

[22:52] <swarley> but yea

[22:52] <PerlJam> swarley++ cool.

[22:53] <swarley> I need to rethink the base object

[22:53] <pmichaud> swarley++   awesome!

[22:54] <swarley> I'm not really sure how perl6 objects are, my brain wants them to be like ruby objects. I looked at nqp-jvm's SixModelObject.java but that has no real information other than the STable, and I pretty much already had that.

[22:58] *** cognominal left
[22:58] <swarley> I can't wait to see regular NQP without the parrot code in it

[22:58] <swarley> That would make it a lot easier to read without having to look back and forth between the source trees

[23:00] <jnthn> swarley: The main thing to realize about 6model is that it does representation polymorphism.

[23:00] <jnthn> swarley: There's not a single "how to represent an object"

[23:00] <jnthn> There's just an STable pointer and you follow that to the REPR.

[23:00] <swarley> Oh, I understand that. 

[23:00] <swarley> I'm not planning on restricting it, or at least if i did I didn't mean to

[23:01] <jnthn> swarley: I didn't think you were. :) I was just trying to explain it. :)

[23:02] <pmurias> swarley: have you seen nqp/docs/serialization_format.markdown?

[23:02] <swarley> Oh okay, I would love to hear an explanation or read a paper on the subject from you. I'm quite certain you know exactly what you're talking about

[23:02] <jnthn> P6opaque is perhaps the most interesting thing to look at but I'm afraid any implementation of it is quite...crazy.

[23:02] <jnthn> In C you do it by calculating a struct on the fly.

[23:02] <swarley> pmurias; I have, but right now I'm just trying to get a basic object system that I can make a test suite for to start

[23:02] <jnthn> On the JVM it's done by calculating a class on the fly...

[23:02] <jnthn> I'm not quite sure how it is in JavaScript :)

[23:02] <swarley> I think a lot of things I'm going to just end up making interfaces for.

[23:02] <swarley> What is the opaque exactly?

[23:04] <pmurias> jnthn: it maps cleanly to the javascript object system

[23:04] *** cognominal joined
[23:04] <pmurias> which is really primitive

[23:04] <jnthn> swarley: It's the representation the majority of objects in NQP and Perl 6 use

[23:05] <swarley> Oh okay, so it's a higher level object representation?

[23:05] *** LordVorp joined
[23:05] <jnthn> pmurias: Nice :)

[23:05] <jnthn> swarley: It's a representation that knows how to lay out object attributes.

[23:06] <pmurias> jnthn: for each stable I just create an object which is a prototype for it's all instances

[23:07] <swarley> Oh, okay. I'm glad you said that now. Because the lowest level object I just prototyped has an attributes array

[23:07] <swarley> err, map

[23:09] <jnthn> swarley: Yeah, the only thing that's common to everything is the STable and an SC.

[23:09] *** jferrero joined
[23:09] *** cognominal left
[23:09] <swarley> Alright. I'm omiting the sc for now, just to get basic functionality

[23:09] <jnthn> *nod*

[23:09] <swarley> To make sure everything works conceptually

[23:12] <pmurias> jnthn: the .symtable attributes of blocks is no longer important?

[23:12] <swarley> See, a really cool thing about doing this with go is the ability of using goroutines

[23:12] <jnthn> pmurias: It's still used

[23:13] <swarley> This is from http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

[23:13] <jnthn> pmurias: And really it's just exposing something already there

[23:13] <swarley> They're called goroutines because the existing terms—threads, coroutines, processes, and so on—convey inaccurate connotations. A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same address space. It is lightweight, costing little more than the allocation of stack space. And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required. Goroutin

[23:13] <swarley> es are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run. Their design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and management.

[23:36] <[Coke]> general community note, inspired by diakopter in #parrot. - when we actually have parrot people on the line to talk to, it helps to actually talk about technology and code and bugs rather than he said/she said crap. It really doesn't help either project along.

[23:57] <[Coke]> unhelpful - in this case not in the case that it didn't further your goal, since it seems you didn't have one there, but in that it helped to sour the relationship between the two projects.

[23:57] <diakopter> I disagree completely

[23:57] <diakopter> I see no relationship soured

[23:57] <[Coke]> You keep doing that.

[23:57] <[Coke]> I'm not sure it means what you think it means.

[23:58] <pmichaud> diakopter: if you're speaking on behalf of rakudo, then I'm not sure you get to decide if it helped or lessened the relationship.  :-)

[23:59] <diakopter> but .. I wasn't doing so

[23:59] <[Coke]> diakopter: so, what was your point in the conversation then, if not to get your technical question finally answered after 2 months?
