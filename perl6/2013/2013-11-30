[04:18] <TimToady> it's possible you're in an address block that cloudflare doesn't like

[08:45] *** Juerd left
[08:45] *** berekuk left
[08:46] <Woodi> how about nqp compiler on moarvm ? mvm is quite new so maybe there is a chance to have sources of nqpc written in moarvmlang ? but looking in the repo I found exactly what someone say, nqp is written in nqplang :) with some parrot ?

[08:47] *** Juerd joined
[08:47] <moritz> Woodi: I only understood some single words of what you wrote

[08:47] <moritz> not the whole thing

[08:47] <moritz> there is no moarvmlang

[08:47] <Woodi> ok, it probably my mistake :)

[08:47] <moritz> there is a bytecode format

[08:48] <moritz> and the nqp compiler is written in NQP.

[08:48] <Woodi> so nqp emits bytecode of nqp compiler ?

[08:49] <moritz> nqp emits bytecode for moarvm.

[08:49] *** hugme joined
[08:49] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v hugme

[08:50] <Woodi> yes, I wanted to say that... so first nqp on moarvm was written in what language ?

[08:50] <moritz> in NQP

[08:51] <moritz> and cross-compiled by one of the other backends

[08:51] <Woodi> oki, let brain postprocess that...

[09:39] <masak> I am having trouble today connecting to feather via ssh.

[09:40] *** tadzik joined
[09:40] <masak> this is following a surprise reboot late last evening.

[09:40] <masak> I skimmed the logs but found nothing about this. anyone have any more details?

[09:41] *** Juerd left
[09:42] <nwc10> masak: Juerd did announce in advance that he was going to reboot them

[09:42] <nwc10> (at least hours, if not a day)

[09:42] <masak> oki, carry on then.

[09:42] <masak> still doesn't explain why I now can't connect through SSH, though.

[09:43] <masak> more exactly, 50% of the time I reach feather, but then the connection is *veeeery* slow.

[09:43] <masak> maybe some heavy process is running on feather1.perl6.nl?

[16:20] <arnsholt> Whoops

[16:20] <sjn> important news \o/

[16:21] <timotimo> hehe.

[16:21] <timotimo> Hater News ...

[16:21] <arnsholt> Laptop trackpad has buttons close to the edge, and sometimes they get pressed when my laptop is on, you know, my lap

[16:22] <sjn> hey arnsholt, wanna join us wednesday and make some decision about organizing something #perl6-relevant in Oslo next year? :)

[16:22] *** hummeleB1 joined
[16:23] <timotimo> arnsholt: if the device is separate from the other stuff you may have luck with "xinput disable"

[16:23] *** MikeFair___ joined
[16:24] <arnsholt> timotimo: Ooh, good tip

[16:24] <arnsholt> I might just disable "both mouse buttons for middle click" outright, since I never use that particular feature

[16:24] *** MikeFair_ left
[16:25] <arnsholt> sjn: I think wednesday evening is my one non-busy day next week, so I was sort of hoping to stay home that day

[16:27] <sjn> arnsholt: don't worry, we don't have a tradition to stress a lot when Oslo.pm is out drinking beers and discussing things :)

[16:28] *** xinming left
[16:28] <jnthn> But with so much good beer, choosing which one to have next is SO stressful!

[16:28] *** xinming joined
[16:29] <sjn> jnthn: ssh!

[16:29] <timotimo> so i just had an idea for an optimization yet again. if we have a scan followed by a literal, we do boyer-moore, but if we have a scan followed by an alt/altseq of literals, we don't do that.

[16:29] <sjn> jnthn: don't tell him about the Beer Selection Stress Syndrome

[16:29] <timotimo> i wonder how hard it would be to make a boyer-moore derivative that works with multiple needles, matching the first one it finds

[16:29] *** MikeFair___ is now known as MikeFair

[16:30] *** MikeFair left
[16:30] <timotimo> also, i think it would be nice if we had the same optimization for .*? that we have for scan, maybe for .* with a boyer-moore-from-the-end search, too.

[16:35] <arnsholt> timotimo: I think it should be possible to merge two Boyer-Moore jump tables. For any character, the merged table has the minimum of the value in the two tables

[16:36] <timotimo> i thought something about the same lines, yeah

[16:36] <arnsholt> That increases my prior confidence that the reasoning is correct =)

[16:36] <timotimo> hah, i only thought about it idly ;)

[16:37] <arnsholt> Me too =)

[16:41] <timotimo> now i'm thinking just merging the tables will cause a big performance loss. if instead you use a table per string and always advance the leftmost needle, you'll be correct 100% and you won't get a big penalty if your patterns are unlucky

[16:42] <arnsholt> Yeah, that sound like it'll work as well

[16:43] *** xinming left

[16:48] <arnsholt> Probably an easier optimisation, for sure

[16:49] <timotimo> hopefully :)

[16:49] <timotimo> i'm not yet sure how exactly our capture stack works, so i'll have to read the code for that first.

[16:50] <jnthn> I think I may have described $!cstack in the workshop slides...

[16:52] <timotimo> i probably won't have time for that today

[17:12] <timotimo> is there a flag i can read out in the compiler that tells me if we're compiling to serialise a module or directly execute code?

[17:12] <jnthn> yeah

[17:12] <timotimo> that's good

[17:12] <jnthn> But I dunno where.

[17:13] <jnthn> Search for precomp_mode or precompilation_mode or so

[17:13] <timotimo> now that i know it exists, i'll have an easier time looking for it :)

[17:13] <jnthn> Where are you, btw?

[17:13] <jnthn> (when you want to know this)

[17:13] <timotimo> i'm thinking of either the regex compiler or the optimizer

[17:13] <jnthn> If you've a World instance handy I think that knows.

[17:14] <timotimo> i do in the optimizer. not sure about the compiler.

[17:14] <jnthn> yeah, you have one in both of those scenarios.

[17:14] <timotimo> good

[17:14] <timotimo> another thing, is it feasible to build a hot-regex-detection in NQP?

[17:14] <timotimo> so that we can do some extra-expensive optimisations only if the regex is sufficiently hot?

[17:15] <jnthn> We don't statically tend to knwo about hotness

[17:15] <jnthn> that's more a runtime-optimization thing.

[17:15] <timotimo> yes, exactly

[17:16] <jnthn> So best you have is in heuristics

[17:16] <timotimo> i was hoping for run-time statistics gathering

[17:16] <timotimo> keeping the qregex QAST tree around maybe.

[17:16] <jnthn> Ah...that sounds like it'll get costly to keep 'em all around...

[17:16] <arnsholt> We don't really do any run-time fiddling with the executed code ATM, do we?

[17:16] <timotimo> i don't think we do

[17:17] <jnthn> No, that's very much VM-space.

[17:17] *** zakharyas joined
[17:17] *** PAARBGG joined
[17:17] <arnsholt> And JIT-space, I guess?

[17:17] *** xinming left
[17:17] <jnthn> That too

[17:17] *** xinming joined
[17:18] <jnthn> Though MoarVM will do type specialization stuff before it gets JIT.

[17:18] <jnthn> That will kinda be the input to the JIT...

[17:19] <TimToady> well, you can make a first-order guess that the inside of a loop is hotter than the outside :)

[17:20] <jnthn> Aye. And loop in regex is quantifier, I guess... :)

[17:20] <timotimo> and after scans

[17:20] <timotimo> (though not necessarily if there's a literal following the scan directly)

[17:21] <TimToady> but the basic problem of an interpreter is that anything could be hot in the right circumstances

[19:39] <timotimo> why what?

[19:39] <timotimo> EZ. on the left side of the = you have a signature with a named parameter

[19:39] <timotimo> on the right you have an object that unpacks to .value and .key

[19:40] <Mouq> So that's... correct behaviour?

[19:40] <timotimo> i think so

[19:40] <timotimo> r: my (:$named) := \(:named<3>); say $named

[19:40] <camelia> rakudo-parrot 1d729f, rakudo-jvm 1d729f: OUTPUT«3␤»

[19:40] <timotimo> this is how you do what you meant

[19:40] <Mouq> Ahhh. timotimo++

[19:42] <timotimo> yw :)

[19:42] <Mouq> That also makes the fact that `my ($a, *@a) := 1;` doesn't work more sensible. It's fine with `\1`

[19:43] <timotimo> yup.

[22:02] <retupmoca> it looks like the error message from dlopen will give you the full path to the file, at which point we could run a regex or something to try and get the real .so
