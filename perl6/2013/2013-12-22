[12:23] <jnthn> afternoon, #perl6

[12:23] * jnthn made it safely to family :)

[12:24] <timotimo> jnthn: \o/

[12:24] <FROGGS> jnthn: hehe, and now you are sitting somewhere in the corner at your laptop? :P

[12:24] <timotimo> jnthn: what's your take on "the error message is better, except if you cause the error in the repl, in which case you either get a null pmc access or infinitely many null pointer exceptions"?

[12:26] <jnthn> FROGGS: No, actually sitting drinking nice coffee while family are away taking care of a couple of errands :)

[12:26] <jnthn> I'll only be around for an hour or so :)

[12:27] <timotimo> jnthn: the error in question is what you get when you write "my int foobar" instead of \foobar or $foobar.

[12:27] <jnthn> timotimo: Is that happening portably or just on NQP on JVM?

[12:27] <jnthn> I know certain errors at the REPL cause it to be very unhappy...

[12:27] <timotimo> didn't get to test it on moar yet

[12:27] <jnthn> And just repeat the error over and over

[12:27] <jnthn> Well, there's Parrot too. The infinite repeating of errors only happend on JVM.

[12:27] <timotimo> well, on jvm i get infinitely many NPE's, on parrot i get a single null pmc access

[12:27] <jnthn> I didn't get chance to look into it.

[12:27] <jnthn> Right

[12:28] <timotimo> it's on rakudo, fwiw

[12:28] <FROGGS> jnthn: shall we merge moar-support into nom now? release is done... (moritz++)

[12:28] <jnthn> So, two bugs. One is the null thingy.

[12:28] <jnthn> FROGGS: I'd rather not do so yet.

[12:28] <FROGGS> jnthn: roger that

[12:28] <jnthn> FROGGS: I'd prefer we do it once it reliably builds for most people.

[12:28] <FROGGS> k

[12:28] <timotimo> okay. before i merge the More Than Less Than Awesome Error Message i'll look more into where the error comes from

[12:28] <timotimo> afk for now

[12:28] <jnthn> timotimo: Yeah, I think there are other cases where this happens.

[12:29] <jnthn> It'd be great to solve them. OTOH, it does mean it's not a specific issue with your improved error, so I'd not block merging that.

[12:30] <jnthn> But yeah, hunting down and fixing the issues with some REPL errors would certainly improve hte REPL experience.

[12:31] <jnthn> FROGGS: From glancing backlog occasionally, I got the impression that lingering GC-invariant-breaking bugs are still haunting the builds of many...

[12:32] *** Rotwang joined
[12:32] <FROGGS> jnthn: I could reactivate some virtual machines and hope it breaks on one of them... otherwise I don't know where to start

[12:33] <jnthn> FROGGS: Well, if you can get hold of the nwc10++ script (I know he already sent the patches to the mailing list) then you can go hunting that way

[12:33] <FROGGS> yeah, I wanted to ask him what I need to do to get results...

[12:34] <jnthn> That's been the most efficient way to hunt/fix GC issues so far.

[12:34] <FROGGS> btw, I remember there was a $sym.split(' ') to get the sarter/stopper of (post)circumfixes... where lives that code?

[12:34] <Rotwang> hi

[12:34] <jnthn> It doesn't always get the one that's immediately blocking things, but it does always give things that are broken.

[12:34] <FROGGS> hi Rotwang 

[12:34] <Rotwang> "I swear the only reason we don’t have factorial as a standard operator in the language, is so that we can impress people by defining it." lol, I was thinking the same thing [;

[12:35] <jnthn> Umm...HLL::Actions iirc

[12:35] <FROGGS> k, thanks!

[12:35] <jnthn> But see the Q grammar, or maybe role STDish

[12:46] <FROGGS> yeah, I took it as a pattern

[14:09] <smls> Just read the "Promises and Channels" advent article by jnthn

[14:09] <smls> Not very excited about  « loop { winner $channel { more $channel { ... } done $channel { last } } »

[14:09] <smls> Is this really supposed to be the standard Perl 6 idiom for processing items from a channel/queue?

[14:10] <timotimo> don't we have a $channel.list?

[14:10] <smls> Three levels of block nesting, just seems excessive.

[14:10] <smls> It seems much simpler in Perl 5:  « while (defined($_ = $queue->dequeue())) { ... } »

[14:11] <timotimo> actually, pretty much the same thing will work in perl6, too

[14:11] <timotimo> let me quickly verify my assumptions

[14:12] <timotimo> you can receive as often as you like and catch the X::Channel::ReceivedOnClosed exception

[14:12] <timotimo> ReceiveOnClosed*

[14:13] <timotimo> if you're guaranteed to be the only receiver on the channel, you can also poll and receive; but if you have more than one thread receiving on the channel, that gives you a race condition

[14:14] <smls> How about merging  « loop { winner * { ... } } »  into a single loop construct:  « whenever { ... } »

[14:14] <smls> (The 'whenever' name was suggested by someone in the advent article's comment section.)

[14:14] <timotimo> doesn't sound bad, aye

[14:17] <smls> Speaking of simplifying nested structures, have you thought about adding syntactic sugar for routines that do nothing but call start {...}?

[14:17] <smls> « sub foo() { start { ... } } »  could become  « sub foo() is promise { ... } »

[14:18] <smls> « @foo.map: -> $x { start { ... } } »  could become  « @foo.map: -> $x { ... } :promise »

[14:19] <timotimo> my &foo = -> { start { ... } } :P

[14:20] <timotimo> hm.

[19:14] <moritz> advent post scheduled for publication.

[19:20] *** SamuraiJack left
[19:23] <smls> While reading S06, I came across the following statement under "Advanced subroutine features":

[19:23] <smls> "The want function is gone. If you want context specific behavior, return an object instead that responds accordingly to the various contextual methods."

[19:24] <smls> However, that defeats the purpose of what would probably be the most common use-case of a want function (if experience with Perl 5's wantarray is anything to go by):

[19:24] <smls> As a performance optimization.

[19:24] <smls> I.e. one might factor out any calculations that are *only* needed to generate the sub's return value, and skip those calculations entirely if the sub is called in void context.

[19:24] <moritz> smls: not at all

[19:24] <smls> Or perform a potentially simpler set of calculations, if we're "only" in scalar context rather then in list context.

[19:24] <moritz> smls: you can put that calculation into the method of an object you return

[19:25] <moritz> the expensive calculation, that is

[19:25] <moritz> it just requires you to approach the problem at bit differently

[19:26] *** ajr_ left
[19:29] *** smls left
[19:29] <moritz> also IMHO a very common use case of wantarray is   wantarray ? @$aref : $aref;

[19:30] <moritz> or wantarray ? @a : @a[0]

[19:36] *** smls joined
[19:37] *** BenGoldberg joined
[19:37] <smls> moritz: ok, but constructing such a context-aware object sounds difficult

[19:37] <smls> not something one would do in a simple every-day function

[19:39] <FROGGS[mobile]2> it just needs to provide .list/.item methods, no?

[19:41] <FROGGS[mobile]2> and the caller would then do: @( foo() )

[19:41] <FROGGS[mobile]2> or foo().Str

[19:41] <FROGGS[mobile]2> or whatever

[19:42] <smls> but would you want to declare and instantiate a custom Class just to return something from a function?

[19:42] *** mtk left
[19:43] <FROGGS[mobile]2> when I want to return something with a behaviour, I'd return an object, yes

[19:43] *** mtk joined
[19:44] *** mtk left
[19:44] <moritz> smls: depends on the function

[19:44] <smls> My point is that it makes something more difficult than it was in Perl 5

[19:44] *** mtk joined
[19:45] <moritz> yes, that's a valid point

[19:45] <moritz> but wantarray/want and multi dispatch simply don't mix

[19:45] *** Ben_Goldberg joined
[19:45] <moritz> and multi dispatch is at least an order of magnitude more useful, so want had to die.

[19:46] *** BenGoldberg left
[19:46] <moritz> multi a(Str $x) { 'Str }; multi a(*@x) { 'List' }; a(b()); # which context is b() called in?

[19:47] <smls> compare you custom-object solution to a simple  « if (defined wantarray) { ... } », or the examples moritz listed above

[19:48] <smls> ok, makes sense
