[00:19] * japhb__ has decided this weekend to keep the yak-shaving limit at Rakudo source fixes; anything that requires changes to VM-specific code, I'm handing the shaver to someone else.  :-)

[00:31] <TimToady> only a syntactic difference

[00:31] <lue> .oO(This compiler writin' sure is hard. How do you ever manage Perl 6‽) On the plus side, though, I got this sudden sense that I *can* understand Perl 6's grammar and actions now. I at least have my foot in the door.

[00:33] <Mouq> everything

[00:33] <TimToady> well, consider the difference between <?[...]> and <?before [...]>

[00:33] <TimToady> the latter are just grouping brackets, and redundant

[00:34] <TimToady> the former are cclass delims

[00:34] <lue> ah, ok. So my statement "is <?[stuff]> eqv. to <?before stuff> ?" was wrong, and should be <?[stuff]> eqv to <?before [stuff]>

[00:34] <lue> or, no.

[00:34] <TimToady> <?foo> means something very different from <?before foo>

[01:00] <[Coke]> japhb__: hopefully it helps with panda. g'luck.

[01:03] <lue> is MARKER/MARKED used to set/look for various flags to see if things happened in other rules? If so, then in NQP::Grammar <?MARKED('endstmt')> checks for the use of the ENDSTMT rule recently, correct?

[01:05] <lue> (And I would assume said flags are subject to some sort of scoping rules, because there don't seem to be any UNMARKER things.)

[01:08] <lue> Waitaminute. Isn't line 49 in NQP/Grammar.nqp redundant? Doesn't  <.unv>?  effectively cover  \h*  ?

[01:09] <camelia> rakudo e55c66: OUTPUT«True␤True␤»

[01:09] <Mouq> It looks like MARKER('thing') sets a hash in the cursor with %h<thing> = <<<Something cursor related>>>, so that's scoped

[01:10] <lue> It had to be, or else one ENDSTMT and then you'd never have a false MARKED('endstmt') again.

[01:10] <lue> aren't I right with Grammar.nqp:49 though? Or is that there because the contents of <.unv> aren't guaranteed to have a \h+ alternation?

[01:12] <Mouq> I believe <<<Something cursor related>>> is a cursor eqv to <?>

[01:12] <Mouq> lue: Looks like it

[01:12] * lue will go to update NQP, and then compare spectests with/without line 49

[01:13] <Mouq> Although it may be an optimization

[01:14] <lue> That's what I was thinking, but the alternation uses |, not ||. (At least, that's what I'd use unless || causes more problems)

[01:15] <Mouq> Wouldn't || throw away the any \h* already matched?

[01:17] <lue> I don't know about that. Point is, it's functionally useless, but I can't say I've ruled out some optimization use for it.

[04:30] <BenGoldberg> It reverses the order of it's arguments

[04:30] <BenGoldberg> Or rather, it's a meta-operator, which modifies a normal operator to create a "new" operator with the argument order reversed

[04:59] <TimToady> niecza's behavior looks correct, anyway

[05:46] * moritz hopes not

[05:46] <moritz> Mouq++ # nqp/stdsigspace

[05:47] <TimToady> that form shouldn't allow whitespace after 'a' and before the comma

[05:55] <TimToady> in the new semantics, the spaces around % don't matter at all

[05:55] <TimToady> only the space after the a or the space after the comma

[05:56] *** dayangkun left
[05:56] <TimToady> which is why the form a +% ',' is recommended if you want spaces on either side of the comma

[05:57] <TimToady> that is, / a +% ',' /

[05:57] <TimToady> it's actually a simplification of the old rules to be more consistent

[05:59] <Mouq> consistency++

[06:00] <TimToady> okay, I lied a little

[06:00] <TimToady> if you write / a+ % ',' / then the space before % is significant, and applies after the whole thing matches

[06:00] <TimToady> 'sigfinal' in STD's quantified_atom rule

[06:01] <TimToady> it just doesn't matter if you write space before the + since that already eats the final ws anyway

At https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/sixmodel/reprs/P6OpaqueBaseInstance.java#L39 it just clones the delegate if there is one, for efficiency. But in change_type, if there is a delegate, we update only the obj.st = newType.st; but fail to update obj.delegate.st to newType.st so the clone ends up with an out-of-date st

[09:06] <jnthn> arnsholt: The solution is thus presumably to update delegate.st if there is an obj.delegate

[09:07] <arnsholt> That sounds very promising, yeah

[09:39] <arnsholt> The does magic happens in Rakudo's src/Perl6/Metamodel/Mixins.nqp

[09:41] <moritz> arnsholt: and in the end, &test.name eq 'what we want' should be true, right?

[12:11] <jnthn> moritz, arnsholt: All of Moar, JVM and Parrot implement change_type differently 'cus they all have sufficiently different memory models :)

[12:11] <arnsholt> Oh, right. Good to know

[12:11] <jnthn> The Moar one doesn't have the risk the JVM one does 'cus it doesn't store a duplicate st pointer anywhere.

[12:12] <arnsholt> I'll try to make a unit test for this, in case of refactoring or some such

[12:12] <jnthn> Yeah

[12:12] <jnthn> It can go in NQP

[12:12] <jnthn> Tehre's no does operator

[12:12] <arnsholt> Yeah

[12:24] <arnsholt> Once I put in a TODO (the very weird null string bug, if you remember), this means we now have three out of eight Zavolaj test files working

[12:24] <arnsholt> The three easy ones, but still

[12:24] <jnthn> yay :)

[12:25] <jnthn> I guess arrays and structs next?

[12:26] <arnsholt> Arrays, probably then structs

[12:26] *** kaleem left
[12:26] <jnthn> CArray will probably be the same pain as VMArray

[12:26] <jnthn> Since the JVM needs you to tell it want kinda memory you're working with for the array

[12:26] <jnthn> Whereas in C you can just screw

[12:27] <jnthn> Wonder if it's possible to base CArray off VMArray somehow...

[12:27] <arnsholt> Troo that

[12:28] <arnsholt> CStruct might be easier, although CStruct will probably involve generating classes a la P6Opaque

[12:28] <jnthn> aye, but you can nab the existing code :D

[12:28] <arnsholt> I know =D

[12:28] <jnthn> and you don't have to support mixins... :)

[14:24] <masak> this afternoon, I have wrested some time away from $dayjob to work on t4 reviews.

[14:25] <masak> also, I will keep thinking about good macro use cases.

[14:28] <mathw> macros are great if you want a new loop structure that writes 'And we're going round again' to a filehandle every time it loops

[14:29] <mathw> ...I really hope you don't want one of those, though

[14:29] <mathw> I've always suspected the best use of macros is for writing really neat libraries and frameworks

[14:29] <mathw> that seems to be how they get used in Lisps

[14:31] *** denis_boyun joined
[14:32] *** colomon left
[14:33] <masak> aye.

[14:33] <arnsholt> jnthn: Any ideas about the AWOL test file in Rakudo?

[14:33] <jnthn> no :)

[14:33] <arnsholt> Right

[14:33] <masak> mathw: at its simplest: APIs package relatively inconvenient computations into relatively convenient names, chunking them and allowing the user to focus on the "what", not the "how".

[14:34] <jnthn> oh...I see it

[14:34] *** rindolf left
[14:34] <jnthn> I think it's a test for something Rakudo has but is not spec

[14:34] <dalek> rakudo/nom: e9830d3 | (Arne Skjærholt)++ | src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/rakudo/RakOps.java:

[14:34] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e9830d3fe5

[14:34] <jnthn> Actually that'd be a sane place to put testse like :from<jvm>

[14:34] <masak> mathw: subroutines do that during runtime. macros do that during compile time.

[14:34] <jnthn> Which are not spec but still Rakudo-provided.

[14:34] <jnthn> We should probably run them as aprt of make test

[14:34] <arnsholt> Yeah =)

[14:35] <jnthn> Also, 00-parrot and 01-sanity could really just merge into 01-sanity :)

[14:35] <arnsholt> But .REPR is spec, right?

[14:35] <jnthn> Yes

[14:35] <jnthn> It is

[14:35] <jnthn> The p6reprname exists in order to hand back a Perl 6 Str

[14:35] <jnthn> Maybe we should have a t/jvm and t/parrot for the vm-specific things 

[14:36] <jnthn> Rather than running then skip-alling 09-pir.t on Rakudo JVM

[14:38] *** colomon joined
[14:38] <arnsholt> True

[14:38] <arnsholt> My test for p6reprname is just making sure Foo.REPR works though

[14:38] <arnsholt> Since in Rakudo .REPR delegates to p6reprname

[14:39] <mathw> masak: quite. I suspect macros might be a little less useful in Perl 6 compared to if, say, C# had them, because Perl 6 has the ability to add methods to classes at runtime etc.

[14:40] <masak> mathw: it reduces but does not remove the need for and usefulness of macros.

[14:40] <mathw> Oh I'm not about to argue they're unnecessary

[14:40] <mathw> People are going to do awesome things with them

[14:40] <mathw> Maybe even me

[14:41] <masak> the difference is simply that: BEGIN semantics rather than mainline semantics.

[14:42] <masak> all that stuff with ASTs is simply necessary because the two worlds operate with different currencies.

[14:42] <mathw> yeah

[15:45] <masak> it was a tradeoff, and one which probably couldn't have done much differently.

[17:25] <TimToady> so I'd predict that other list-associative operators would also fail

[17:28] <TimToady> ooh, same failure in rakudo now :)

[17:29] <TimToady> (not that reversing a commutative operator makes any sense, but still)

[17:29] <colomon> so list-associative Rop should reverse the list of arguments before sending to op?

[17:30] <colomon> well, this certainly is a rich vein of bugs

[17:31] *** ajr_ left
[17:33] <TimToady> reversing the entire list would seem to be the most straightforward thing to do

[17:35] <colomon> you mean transforming [Rop] list to [op] list.reverse ?

[17:35] <colomon> what is $a R~ $b R~ $c supposed to do?

[17:36] <TimToady> probably the same thing

[17:36] <flussence> moritz: gave it a try, I can get a working rakudo-parrot with no trouble, but it seems to get really confused with the jvm bits (installs them to the parrot folders)

[17:39] *** kurahaupo joined
[17:39] *** kurahaupo_ left
[17:40] <colomon> TimToady: so we need a rule saying that if op is list-associative, Rop generates a new operator which is also list-associative, takes a list, reverses it, and passes it to op?

[17:40] * colomon wonders if this is in roast somewhere.

[17:40] * TimToady guesses not

[17:40] *** grondilu left
[17:41] * colomon has discovered that a $work bug he fixed a week ago has somehow mutated into a brand new bug.  :(

[17:43] <TimToady> doesn't look like roast has such a test, offhand

[17:44] <TimToady> it tests that R is transparent to precedence, but doesn't seem to test that it is also transparent to associativity

[17:45] <TimToady> I note that the list reversal semantics are not just simpler, but consistent with the decision that mixed list associations must use the same operator consistently, or be parenthesized

[19:46] <jnthn> And that we get rid of an alternation

[19:47] <lue> git blame says you added unv's contents and ENDSTMT in 2011, so I'm guessing there was some speed/comment advantage for the \h* line at the time?

[19:48] <lue> s/comment/correctness/

[19:48] <jnthn> Very possible speed

[19:49] <jnthn> If it was pre-LTM for example...

[19:49] <jnthn> Now, the tran-LTMer will happily look into the unv

[19:50] <lue> As my gist shows, there appears to be a modest improvement of a few seconds running the test w/o the line, but I have no clue what the margin of error is :)

[19:51] <jnthn> Yeah. But it's no worse, and it's a simplification :)

[19:51] *** bluescreen10 left
[19:51] <jnthn> Removing unrequired code is always a nice thing if it's not helping performance.

[19:51] <moritz> lue: do it 5 times or more, and calculate the standard deviation

[19:51] <jnthn> And I don't see how this case could be these days

[19:52] <lue> jnthn: the only caveat I see is if all the following occur: 1) unv loses its \h+ alternative 2) ENDSTMT still needs an effectively \h* alternative. Since neither rule has been touched in about two years, I doubt this will occur.

[20:46] * TimToady would like to point out for the record that a Dyson sphere that is cool enough to make dark matter out of would have to have some way of redirecting all the energy output of their star to some sink other than the universe at large.  Just sayin'...

[20:47] <geekosaur> Dyson's original assumption was that the point was to capture and use all the solar power output

[20:47] *** aindilis joined
[20:48] <TimToady> thermodynamically speaking, you can't

[20:48] <TimToady> you have to radiate heat

[20:48] <geekosaur> yes, but the radiated heat is difficult to detect over interstellar distances

[20:48] <geekosaur> (although, see recent discovery of free-floating planets by their heat signatures)

[20:49] <TimToady> even if it's in the far microwave region, it'd be a huge bump on CMB if there were enough of them to account for dark matter

[20:49] <TimToady> free-floaters don't have to radiate the energy output of a star

[20:49] <TimToady> at we still can detect them by their IR siggie

[20:50] *** Rotwang left
[20:50] <TimToady> dark matter doesn't seem to radiate *at all*

[20:50] <TimToady> that we can detect

[20:56] *** sqirrel left
[20:56] <TimToady> I'd much sooner believe that the Dyson spheres have found a way to sink the flow into dark energy, and that's why the universe is now accellerating, because there are too many Dyson spheres :)

[20:58] <grondilu> redirecting the light of a star to some kind of a sink?  Easy, make a kugleblitz:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics)

[22:39] <lue> hey, I got some times: https://gist.github.com/lue/7078598 (result is that the removal causes no significant speed improvement, but since there's no epic slowdown or regression, I think it's safe to push. Stop me if I'm wrong.)
