[00:11] <grondilu> adu: http://bellard.org/jslinux/  <-- that's impressive

[00:11] <adu> grondilu: yeah, I heard it uses llvm2js combined with clang

[00:12] <adu> or something like that

[00:16] <grondilu> does that mean they compiled a kernel into javascript code?

[00:19] <adu> grondilu: I guess so

[00:19] <gfldex> no, it's a x86 emulator

[00:19] <gfldex> it's fairly basic on the hardware side, it got a ramdisk and serial ports

[00:19] <gfldex> and in that it runs a linux kernel

[00:20] <adu> here it is: http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html

[00:20] <gfldex> that bellard fellow did a lot of cool stuff

[08:34] * lizmat can't do a pull request without getting other stuff along   :-(

[08:36] <lizmat> fwiw, these are the changes: https://gist.github.com/lizmat/5597773

[08:37] * lizmat wishes she had a commit bit  :-)

[08:37] <FROGGS> you could clone to another location :/

[08:40] <sorear> lizmat: branches!

[08:41] <lizmat> sorear: yes, branches.  The problem is that if I branch now, it includes a number of other fixes that I made which are in the pull request for nom

[08:42] *** berekuk joined
[08:42] <lizmat> I polluted my version of nom

[08:43] <lizmat> see pull request #138 (nom) and #139 (dotkvshoulddie).  #139 contains stuff that shouldn't be in there

[08:43] <FROGGS> what if you checkout the revision right before adding your commits, and then create a new branch? does that work?

[08:44] <lizmat> no, because there are other peoples fixes in it after that

[08:44] *** araujo joined
[08:45] <lizmat> so I should probably checkout just before my first commit, branch and then start cherry picking ?

[08:45] <lizmat> or clone again   :-(

[08:45] <lizmat> maybe I'll just do that

[08:46] <FROGGS> might be less headaches

[08:47] <FROGGS> jnthn: I watched a video from you about optimization last night, this is the result: https://gist.github.com/FROGGS/d830a84c4bb9f6b2fe07

[08:47] <FROGGS> I hope there is no thinko, and I hope it is worth committing

[08:48] <moritz> there is a thinko

[08:48] <moritz> you return the result of the cmp

[08:48] <moritz> not the sorted list

[08:50] <FROGGS> ahh, yes

[08:56] <labster> well, I thought that I had figured out how to fix Rakudo to let assigning Nil to a container yield the empty container type, but it's not working unless I call infix:<=> directly.

[08:57] <moritz> also the (Mu, Mu) special case is wrong; there could be call as   sort(&comparator, $single-item) which shouldn't do a comparison at all, just return $single-item

[08:58] <moritz> labster: the last time I approached that topic, the problem was that   my $x = Nil;  should produce Any (the default), not Mu (the container type)

[08:58] <moritz> labster: and it needs a special case in C

[08:58] <labster> my Cool $f = 3; $f = Nil #`($f set to Nil) ; infix:<=>($f, Nil) # $f set to Cool

[09:07] <lizmat> ok, will branch from 2a04f23dbcbe42dd8e62a0e352d116fc0464be15, this will miss a few commits from you wrt to constant folding

[09:07] <moritz> no problem, a merge won't remove them

[11:00] <mathw> lizmat: in theory, with the ability to call a Perl 5 module from Perl 6 you could run a Perl 6 test suite against the Perl 5 implementation to ensure the test suite matches the Perl 5 one, before then running it against the Perl 6 module. Except the interface to the module wouldn't be the same, so you'd need to shim it a bit...

[11:01] <lizmat> well, yes, that's the problem, I think: you can create a Test.pm API that would work in both Perl 5 and Perl 6, but you'd still have code inbetween that is either Perl 5 or Perl 6 and would not run both

[11:02] <lizmat> I guess you could write something with fudging, as fudging takes out lines of code, and not tests

[14:12] <yoleaux> 16 May 2013 18:44Z <jnthn> donaldh: the runner seems to work fine on Windows

[14:12] <yoleaux> 14:11Z <FROGGS> donaldh: you might find this interesting: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-05-17#i_7082019

[14:12] <FROGGS> nwc10: I mot sure though that this is the right time for these kind of optimizations, maybe it is cleverer to wait until rakudo has landed?

[14:12] <FROGGS> donaldh: o/ *g*

[14:12] * donaldh noticed flashing IRC icon

[14:13] <nwc10> FROGGS: jnthn accidentally made NQP on JVM about 15% faster.

[14:13] <nwc10> so there is potential for quick clean wins, if you can find them

[14:13] <nwc10> *but*, yes

[14:13] <FROGGS> ya, you are right

[14:13] <nwc10> effort better spent on "make it work" ahead of "make it work fast"

[14:13] <donaldh> nwc10: sounds great - do you have more details ?

[14:14] <FROGGS> I've watched his "optimizing rakudo" video last night and was keen to find something to improve :/

[14:14] <jnthn> Note that anything that makes things faster reduces build times which in turn lets me make thigns work faster :)

[14:14] <nwc10> donaldh: no. Really not. sorry

[14:14] <FROGGS> VERYBODY HURRY!!!

[14:14] <nwc10> donaldh: you'd have to ask pmichaud what his hunch was about where th memory went

[14:14] <FROGGS> MAKE THINGS FASTER FOR FASTER JNTHN!

[14:14] <nwc10> the big slow "spendy" thing is compiling the setting

[14:15] <FROGGS> tadzik: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyfAxxdYAP8

[14:15] <nwc10> so if you know enough of the Java toolchain to be able to get stats on that, it's really "does anything jump out as obviously slow?"

[14:15] <FROGGS> "Jonathon Worthington: Optimizing Rakudo Perl 6 " - March 2012

[14:15] <donaldh> nwc10: yep. I tried using the JVM hprof cli commands last night but they barfed so need to use more sophisticated tools :-)

[14:15] <nwc10> "bigger hammer!"

[14:16] * [Coke] hits the video... and realizes he's never heard jnthn speak.

[14:16] <FROGGS> I did, last YAPC::EU

[14:16] <FROGGS> it was about Rakudo::Debugger, and it was impressive to see the open mouths of the attendees

[14:17] <donaldh> Also tried the profiler in jvisualvm but that seemed to give up too. I think because the generated backing classes for P6 objects are generated in memory and jvisualvm cannot find them to optimize them.

[14:17] <FROGGS> (mine included)

[14:17] * [Coke] 's american brain cringes internally at all the british pronounciations!

[14:17] <nwc10> you'd better get used to it :-)

[14:18] <diakopter> I've found jvisualvm quite useful sometimes

[14:18] <nwc10> anyway, don't worry. Even the US is going to get outnumbered by Hinglish and then Chinglish. :-(

[14:18] <[Coke]> maybe if he sang the presentation it woudl come out in an american accent.

[14:18] <donaldh> diakopter: Yep. Fastest way to gather profiling stats.

[14:19] <donaldh> I will spend my evening hacking calories trying to unblock using jvisualvm

[17:59] <lizmat> [Coke]: wrt to pugs smoke, something I did ?

[17:59] <TimToady> the compiler has to know about native variables in order to modify them; currently it knows only how to this via unboxing, but there eventually needs to be a mechanism to know about native containers (aka "pointers") like C does

[18:00] <[Coke]> I don't expect people to necessarily track pugs when roasting, it's ok, lizmat.

[18:01] <lizmat> I tried to fudge it as far as I understand how pugs works, though

[18:01] <lizmat> so I would like to learn from any fudging mistakes I made

[18:01] <TimToady> so that there's some way to do the box-increment-unbox without actually doing the boxing and unboxing

[18:03] <[Coke]> I can't 

[18:03] <[Coke]> worked outside the harness for me, though.

[18:03] <TimToady> but that requires a static type engine such as C has if we want to program Perl 6 in the C subset (or the C subset that the JVM allows :)

[18:08] <colomon> timotimo: there isn't exactly an automatic way of doing it at the moment, so far as I know.

[18:09] <colomon> timotimo: trying to improve that is on my to-do list, but distressingly far down it at the moment.

[18:09] <lizmat> [Coke]: something weird going on with the plan there‚Ä¶   maybe we should just forget about a plan in S09-hashes/objecthash.t

[18:09] <lizmat> if you change the plan to 29, you will get errors on rakudo, for some reason

[18:10] <lizmat> hmmmm‚Ä¶.. could it be that fudging acts on number of lines, and that the non-test lines cause a problem?

[18:10] <timotimo> colomon: so, do i have to copy the lib folders together into some place or other?

[18:11] <colomon> timotimo: usually when I'm working with a module in Niecza I just directly specify its path on the command line using -I

[18:11] <colomon> but that's not exactly "installing"

[18:12] <lizmat> [Coke]: I think I know a way around it...

[18:13] <timotimo> hm. my solution to GRAPH from masakism won't run on niecza :(

[18:14] <colomon> timotimo: I'm not sure niecza is doing anything useful at all with library include paths at the moment.

[18:14] <[Coke]> lizmat: if I run it by hand, I get 29 tests, which is the plan.

[18:14] * lizmat is counting

[18:15] <[Coke]> colomon: good work on niecza; only 17 failures.

[18:15] <timotimo> well, at least it doesn't complain about the library missing when i copy the lib folder to my project dir and do -Ilib

[18:26] <timotimo> that would explain it.

[18:26] <timotimo> is rakudo behaving to spec?

[18:26] <lizmat> feels to me that it doesn't

[18:28] <timotimo> you've spent a lot of time slogging through the whole spec recently, haven't you?

[18:28] <timotimo> i guess i'll search for the place where it's specced

[18:32] *** zby_home left
[18:33] <timotimo> oh, look, i have found a mention of (). wasn't that deprecated from the spec? anyway, the sentence is Since method calls are performed directly on any object, Nil can respond to certain method calls. Nil.defined returns False (whereas ().defined returns True). and it's from S02

[18:33] <lizmat> timotimo: I was familiarising myself with Perl 6, anno 2013.  It was at least 8 years ago since I last looked at Apocalypses

[18:33] <lizmat> I haven't seen them all yet

[18:34] <timotimo> OK

[18:34] <timotimo> i can't find the place where the behavior of slices that are bigger than the array itself are specced

[18:35] <lizmat> I think they're only specced in the context of Z and X and the like

[18:35] <timotimo> oh? i'll have a look there then

[18:36] <lizmat> the smaller ones need to be repeated, in some contexts

[18:36] <lizmat> rn: (1, 2, 3, 4)[*].perl.say;

[18:36] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650, niecza v24-51-g009f999: OUTPUT¬´(1, 2, 3, 4)‚ê§¬ª

[18:36] <timotimo> AFAIK that just means that the length of the list is passed to the closure inside [] and that becomes the result

[18:37] <timotimo> huh, wait, what?

[18:37] <timotimo> rn: my @a = 1, 2, 3; @a[*].perl.say

[18:37] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650, niecza v24-51-g009f999: OUTPUT¬´(1, 2, 3)‚ê§¬ª

[18:37] <timotimo> i thought that would have to return only one element?

[18:38] <timotimo> rn: my @a = 1, 2, 3; @a[3].perl.say

[18:38] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650, niecza v24-51-g009f999: OUTPUT¬´Any‚ê§¬ª

[18:39] *** gudahtt left
[18:40] <TimToady> S09:218 talks about auto-truncating ranges

[18:44] <lizmat> so from that I gather that niecza is right in the (0..4)[^10] case ?

[18:45] <TimToady> no

[18:45] <TimToady> rakudo is

[18:46] <lizmat> "when used as an rvalue, the range is truncated as necessary to map only valid locations"

[18:47] <lizmat> rn: (1, 2, 3, 4)[4..9].perl.say;

[18:47] <camelia> niecza v24-51-g009f999: OUTPUT¬´(Any, Any, Any, Any, Any, Any)‚ê§¬ª

[18:47] <camelia> ..rakudo 9c5650: OUTPUT¬´()‚ê§¬ª

[18:48] <TimToady> that's an rvalue, so rakudo is truncating

[18:48] <lizmat> in this case, they're both wrong as they don't die?  "legal for a range or sequence iterator to extend beyond the end of an array as long as its min value is a valid subscript"

[18:49] <TimToady> arguably 1 off the end is still kinda legal for talking about arrays

[18:49] <TimToady> as a degerate case producing 0 values

[18:49] <lizmat> rn: (1, 2, 3, 4)[5..9].perl.say;

[18:52] <TimToady> also, if it's easier for rakudo to ignore whether the left arg is within the array, then maybe it'd be better to spec it that way anyway

[18:55] <nwc10> TimToady: so, if I understand you correctly, you would like it for Perl 6 to have a means to be able to implement ++ on native types such as int?

[18:55] *** ggoebel joined
[18:56] <TimToady> nwc10: why not?  incrementing native ints is, like, really, really fast in C

[18:57] <nwc10> yes, sorry if I wasn't clear. I didn't mean "why not?" I more meant "but there's got to be a concept added, doesn't there, to get this to work? As one needs to have a signature that behaves somewhat like a C++ &, to force reference semantics"

[18:57] <lizmat> TimToady: if you're changing the spec there, there is something similar about splice in S32/Containers:812

[18:57] <TimToady> the native part of Perl 6 has to understand the difference between lvalues and rvalues much as C does

[18:57] <TimToady> lizmat: maybe, but I can be argued into keeping it like it is too :)

[18:58] <nwc10> I think that it would be useful to have, as demonstrably I was expecting it to work, and was a bit confused as to why not. Until it was (sort of) explained that there's no way to do it currently

[18:58] <lizmat> but then we have a rakudobug right now

[18:59] <lizmat> and a niecza bug as well, actually

[18:59] <TimToady> r: my $b = Buf.new: 65..70; say $b.splice(3,3)

[19:00] <lizmat> yeah, but for Iteratives it works and doesn't complain when doing things after the last index

[19:13] <lizmat> TimToady: do you agree that %b= %a{ slce }:delete:p is a good way of slicing out elements of a hash into another hash?

[19:14] <lizmat> *slice

[19:15] <PerlJam> lizmat: I don't know what TimToady thinks, but that looks good to me :)

[19:15] <lizmat> I was thinking to at least add tests for that already

[19:16] <lizmat> todo tests  :-)

[19:16] <TimToady> I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work the way you expect

[19:17] <lizmat> I'll take that as a +1 on writing todo tests  :-)

[19:18] <PerlJam> What does %hash{@slice}:delete return currently?  Just keys?

[19:18] <lizmat> just the values

[19:18] <PerlJam> Hmm.

[19:18] <lizmat> just as in p5

[19:19] <PerlJam> so %hash{@slice}:p:delete would be broken

[19:20] <lizmat> yes

[19:20] <TimToady> adverbs aren't ordered

[19:20] <TimToady> just as named args aren't ordered

[19:21] <PerlJam> ah.  good to know

[19:21] <lizmat> they are in the implementation, unfortunately

[19:21] <lizmat> by virtue of some being more constraint than others

[19:21] <lizmat> r: my %h=a=>1,b=>2; say %h<a>:delete:p; say %h

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§("b" => 2).hash‚ê§¬ª

[19:21] <PerlJam> sounds like something that needs tests if they don't exist already

[19:21] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650: OUTPUT¬´1‚ê§("b" => 2).hash‚ê§¬ª

[19:22] <TimToady> semantically you have to *do* them in an order, but the syntax shouldn't care

[19:33] <FROGGS> good, git is not the easiest to start with... I think it might make sense to do a bit svn before git

[19:33] <lizmat> to me that feels like saying: it is good to learn programming with BASIC

[19:33] <masak> yeah, kinda.

[19:33] <FROGGS> why not?

[19:34] <masak> learning svn first will probably both help and confuse; one more than the other, depending on circumstances.

[19:34] <FROGGS> depends on the audience

[19:37] <masak> FROGGS: in fact, as one who learned SVK, I think I may have had an easier time with Git than those who went straight from a centralized version control system.

[19:38] <FROGGS> hmmm, k

[19:38] <masak> in some sense, Git is a file system protocol with an extra (history) dimension built in.

[19:39] <masak> lizmat: TUTOR/PLATO seems awesome.

[20:09] <timotimo> vim syntax highlighting for this file has reached the point where i can no longer use vim to edit.

[20:09] <donaldh_> I have >10,000 lines.

[20:10] <donaldh_> So BTrace successfully instruments all the generated classes, which is good.

[20:10] <donaldh_> BTrace also lets you write java programs, so I can write some code to roll up the data as it is collected.

[20:37] <lizmat> that brand new train station provided minor annoyances?

[20:48] <lizmat> masak: and c.s: is there a way to find out *which* keys matched with this smart match? my %h=a=>1,b=>2,c=>3; <a e> ~~ %h

[20:49] *** donaldh left
[20:49] <masak> lizmat: no, and generally, smartmatching is only meant to give you a True or False answer. if you want more, you want your own construct, probably.

[20:50] <lizmat> I was afread so‚Ä¶  

[20:50] <masak> lizmat: only regexp matching gives more information for successes, AFAIK.

[20:50] <masak> lizmat: though TimToady's full-fledged OKness proposal seemed to point in a direction where successes and failures were annotated with various information.

[20:50] <lizmat> but that would mean first building a string

[20:51] <masak> I don't like the idea of doing it all the time, though. because it would have a performance penalty, too.

[20:51] <masak> better to special-case it with a sub or method of one's own making.

[20:52] <masak> lizmat: I'm also put in mind of people's expectations of junctions. after becoming comfortable with junctions helping them in boolean situations, they also want the answer to the question "but *what* matched?" -- which you're Not Meant To Ask.

[21:30] <FROGGS> welcome to #perl6 :P

[21:30] <masak> donaldh: I'd like to try. :)

[21:30] <lizmat> where you learn something else every day!

[21:30] <sorear> masak: Have you encountered the norm and trace maps yet?

[21:30] <masak> sorear: no.

[21:30] <masak> well, "norm" sounds familiar.

[21:30] <masak> as does "trace".

[21:30] <donaldh> Please give it a try. Tho I warn you that my braincells are weak tonight.

[21:31] <masak> donaldh: how familiar are you with complex numbers?

[21:31] <masak> donaldh: do you know why they were discovered?

[21:31] *** araujo left
[21:31] <masak> (I need to know where to start explaining.)

[21:31] <sorear> masak: http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/galoistheory/tracenorm.pdf

[21:32] <sorear> neatly generalizes the absolute value of a complex number

[21:32] <masak> ooh

[21:32] <donaldh> I understand complex numbers, but not sure if I ever knew why they were discovered.

[21:32] *** araujo joined
[21:33] <masak> donaldh: they were discovered because some polynomials with x^3 in them didn't have three zeroes, as expected/predicted.

[21:33] <masak> donaldh: if you add i = sqrt(-1), suddenly everything makes much more sense.

[21:34] <donaldh> yep. which always felt like an indirect why to me.

[21:35] <donaldh> I have a book called 50 mathematical ideas which covers imaginary numbers.

[21:35] <donaldh> I really should keep reading it :-)

[21:35] <masak> donaldh: the neat thing is that it handles not just x^3, but any x^N. suddenly such polynomials have N roots. (sometimes roots coincide.) this is known as "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra": an N-ary polynomial has N roots.

[21:36] <masak> so you don't need anything "beyond" i. i explains everything. which is rather huge.

[21:36] * donaldh 's mind was blown at infinity.

[21:36] <sorear> complex numbers are necessary because they are the smallest field which contains the rationals and is both algebraically closed and closed under limits

[21:36] <masak> yeah. complex numbers are surprisingly consistent.

[21:37] <masak> it's almost like they "want" to exist.

[21:37] <sorear> also, quantum mechanics requires them.

[21:37] <masak> or at least a field that is isomorphic to them.

[21:38] <masak> donaldh: anyway. getting to the point. the decision that i = sqrt(-1) is still somewhat arbitrary.

[21:38] <donaldh> yep.

[21:38] <masak> donaldh: there are two other likely candidates that would also work, namely, i * i = 0 or i * i = 1. these yield two other fields: the dual numbers and the split-complex numbers, respectively.

[21:39] <masak> donaldh: what I realized today is that there's a way to represent complex numbers as (some) 2 x 2 matrices. and if you consider *all* 2 x 2 real matrices, these three fields (complex, dual, split-complex) are all the fields you need.

[21:40] <sorear> a algebra over a field is a vector space equipped with multiplication

[21:41] <sorear> a unital, associative algebra is one that is a ring

[21:41] <sorear> a finite dimensional algebra is finite dimensional as a vector space, it has a finite basis

[21:41] <donaldh> mind blown

[21:42] <sorear> how many 2-dimensional unital, associative algebras are there over the real numbers?

[21:42] <masak> 3?

[21:42] <sorear> we can always pick one basis element to be <1>

[21:42] <sorear> call the other basis element i

[21:42] <sorear> the algebra is defined by i^2 = A + Bi

[21:43] <sorear> I think the answer is 3, yeah

[21:43] <masak> me too.

[21:43] <masak> donaldh: not only that, but (for example) dual numbers have applications in applied mathematics and quantum physics, too.

[21:44] <masak> so they're not just theoretical constructs. they're actually usable.

[21:44] <masak> I'm a little surprised we don't hear about them more often.

[21:44] <lizmat> r: my %h{Any}; %h{Any}=1; my @a= %h{ grep { $_ ~~ Any }, %h.keys} ; say @a.perl   # this works

[21:46] <camelia> rakudo 9c5650: OUTPUT¬´Array.new(Any => 1)‚ê§¬ª

[21:46] <lizmat> that one actually works

[21:46] <[Coke]> uconn, my home state school!

[21:46] <donaldh> that's _the_ bit which has always amazed me. Theoretical mathematical construct that was, for want of a better term, conjured out of thin air is the foundation of applied maths, quantum mechanics and more.

[21:47] <masak> donaldh: I guess it's because mathematicians tend to find "systems" which are internally consistent and make sense.

[21:47] <sorear> since D!=0, we can pick C = -DB/2, leaving jj = DDBB/4 + DDA

[21:47] <masak> donaldh: and the world basically has to run on systems like those.

[21:48] <sorear> or jj = DD(A + BB/4); DD is a positive nonzero arbitrary number, so we can always force jj = {1,0,-1}

[21:48] <masak> donaldh: but really, I'm amazed by it too, and I don't really know why.

[21:48] <masak> sorear: QED, it seems.

[21:49] <donaldh> I suppose it only seems arbitrary or conjured because we have difficulty visualising its origins. Whereas real numbers are easy to visualise. 

[21:50] <donaldh> But real numbers were conjured up in much the same way.

[21:50] <sorear> real numbers aren't all that easy to visualize

[21:51] <sorear> it's easy to visualize something deceptively similar to the real numbers, but your intuitions will all apart when you get to stuff like Banach-Tarski

[21:51] * donaldh turns to google

[21:52] <sorear> there seems to be an unwritten rule in fundamental physics that all functions that are used are constrained to be complex-analytic

[21:52] <sorear> non-analytic field configurations aren't even considered

[21:52] <sorear> which is really extremely constraining

[21:53] <moritz> but also seems to work pretty well for explaining real-world stuff

[21:53] *** konundra left
[21:53] <masak> also, to be fair, holomorphic functions are probably the prettiest thing I've ever encountered in mathematics.

[21:54] <masak> something about them just makes a whole lotta sense. more than it "should" if complex numbers were just some thing that humans invented.

[21:54] <lizmat> r: my %h{Any}; %h{Any}=1; say (%h{Any}:p).perl; my @a=Any; say @a.perl; say (%h{@a}:p).perl

[21:55] <lizmat> it looks like doing a slice out of an object hash with Any as a key, is not returning the right thing  :-(

[21:55] <lizmat> it works with a scalar:

[21:56] <lizmat> r: my %h{Any}; %h{Any}=1; say (%h{Any}:p).perl; my @a=Any; say @a.perl; say (%h{@a[0]}:p).perl
