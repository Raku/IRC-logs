[00:27] <timotimo> should i have to declare my own $/ locally in order for parallel matchings to not explode?

[00:28] <timotimo> bleeeeeeh

[00:28] <timotimo> nominal type check failed for parameter null? really? :(

[00:32] <timotimo> jnthn: i'm getting some weirdness when doing m/.../ in multiple parallelly executed blocks, even if i manually define a $/, or if i $foo ~~ m/.../ -> $match instead

[00:34] <timotimo> actually, i have two different matchings going on in there, maybe they overlap in a bad way?

[00:49] <timotimo> i'm losing the last line and don't know why

[00:49] <timotimo> maybe because it doesn't have a newline at the end?

[00:51] <timotimo> yeah, i don't actually see any code to handle the last line if it doesn't end in a newline

[00:53] <timotimo> i think i'll have to get some rest before i tackle this code.

[10:11] <nwc10> good UGT, #perl6

[10:11] <nwc10> who is it? (in the sense of doing the next release)

[10:11] <nwc10> which I think is next Thursday for the compiler

[10:11] <timotimo> i thought it was going to be moritz

[10:11] <timotimo> yes, 6 days

[10:14] <timotimo> there is no function to rename/move a file?

[10:17] <moritz> isn't masak++ traditionally doing the November release?

[10:17] <moritz> ah no, lizmat++ does, according to docs/release_guide.pod

[10:18] <moritz> I'll just do the star release

[10:18] <timotimo> oh, are you the star releaser then?

[10:18] <timotimo> good to know

[10:18] <hoelzro> have people started coming up with cool advent calendar ideas? =)

[10:19] *** kurahaupo left
[10:19] *** daniel-s left
[10:27] <timotimo> jnthn: is there a good reason to keep the initial read attempt size at 32 kbytes? it would seem like with an async lines() it would be cool to get the first line ASAP, so maybe reduce the initial read amount to 1kbyte or so?

[10:28] <moritz> timotimo: a read that's smaller than the system buffer size won't be much faster

[10:29] <timotimo> oh, ok

[10:29] *** iSlug left
[10:30] <timotimo> i didn't lose the last line this time \o/

[10:32] *** kivutar joined

[10:33] <FROGGS> :/

[10:38] *** tgt joined
[10:40] *** pecastro_ joined
[10:40] <nwc10> however, system buffer size more likely to be 4K than 32K. But, careful benchmarking for the win here

[10:40] <moritz> how big are the chunks typically in which stuff is read from disc?

[10:40] <nwc10> and this is subtle optimisation, so maybe not as much of a win as dropping the memory use

[10:40] <nwc10> moritz: yes. :-)

[10:41] <nwc10> moritz: possibly not the same as the buffer size

[10:41] <nwc10> moritz: and will vary between everything.

[10:41] *** pecastro left
[10:42] <timotimo> right. i should get back to bigger memory wastages :P

[10:43] <timotimo> huh, apparently i didn't rebuild enough of ... everything

[10:43] <timotimo> to get my code changes to apply

[10:43] <timotimo> moritz: can you assist me with figuring this out properly?

[10:44] <moritz> timotimo: is that concurrent stuff?

[10:44] <timotimo> i was editing a .java file in src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/.../io/ and doing make j-install in nqp, then in rakudo

[10:44] <timotimo> it's makefile stuff :)

[10:44] <moritz> ok

[10:44] <timotimo> some missing dependency, but where?

[10:45] <moritz> wait wait wait, what happened?

[10:45] <timotimo> well, first i'll verify with a j-clean j-install that my changes are actually in the right place

[10:45] <moritz> so far you have described what you did, but not what's wrong?

[10:45] <timotimo> oh. my changes didn't cause any change in the behavior. i added some debug prints that really should have been hit

[10:46] <moritz> did the 'make j-install' in nqp recompile anything?

[10:46] <timotimo> jes

[10:46] <timotimo> javac -source 1.7 -cp 3rdparty/asm/asm-4.1.jar:3rdparty/asm/asm-tree-4.1.jar:3rdparty/jline/jline-1.0.jar:3rdparty/jna/jna.jar -g -d bin src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/io/*.java src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/jast2bc/*.java src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/runtime/*.java src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/sixmodel/*.java src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/sixmodel/reprs/*.java src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/tools/*.java 

[10:47] <timotimo> so it was in there

[10:47] <moritz> and then, did rakudo's make recompile anything?

[10:48] <moritz> (it does for me)

[10:48] <timotimo> no, it did not

[10:48] <timotimo> i may need to run configure.pl again?

[10:49] <moritz> no

[10:49] <timotimo> er ... huh?!

[10:49] <timotimo> i did a full rebuild and my debug print is still not getting executed?

[10:49] <timotimo> i must be doing something horribly wrong

[10:50] *** kivutar left
[10:51] <moritz> wut.

[10:51] <moritz> I just did a  touch src/vm/jvm/runtime/org/perl6/nqp/io/SocketHandle.java; make j-install

[10:51] <moritz> and then in rakudo, 'make j-all'

[10:51] <moritz> and it recompiled lots of stuff

[10:52] <timotimo> OK, it may not be build system trouble, it may be ... me missing something blindingly obvious i guess

[10:52] <moritz> quite possible :-)

[10:53] <timotimo> System.out.println("test") should give some output, right?

[10:53] <moritz> one might think so :-)

[10:56] <timotimo> no rebuilding is taking place in rakudo's j-all :(

[10:59] <timotimo> herp...?! a debug say in the lines method of the nqp-level object gets executed, it then calls Ops.linesasync, which starts with a debug System.out.println that *does not* get called ... what?!?

[11:00] *** FROGGS[mobile] left
[11:00] <timotimo> okay, i added a die_s to the beginning and that doesn't get hit either :o

[13:24] <preflex>  Consider it noted.

[13:30] <[Coke]> I haven't tried to do this since the RT upgrade...

[13:30] <preflex>  [Coke]: you have 1 new message. '/msg preflex messages' to read it.

[13:31] <[Coke]> lizmat++ !

[13:32] <moritz> [Coke]++ # our tireless meta committer

[14:02] <[Coke]> ... plus a lot more todo/skips in the test suite that don't have named tickets.

[14:05] <colomon> BTW, the modules ADT, File::Spec, File::Spec::Case, Inline, JSON::RPC, LWP::Simple, Questhub, Sitemap::XML::Parser, and XML all broke sometime between Oct 25 and Nov 2, and are still broken, according to my smoke tester.

[14:05] <[Coke]> there's some LHF that doesn't require much programming or perl6 knowledge. look for rakudo skips/todos that don't reference a ticket number, create a ticket, referring to the test file, copy in the failing code (run it to show how it fails), then update the file in roast to refer to the newly created ticket number.

[14:06] <FROGGS> colomon: I'll fix Inline then...

[14:06] <moritz> colomon++ # smoke testing

[18:33] <TimToady> to me the one-at-a-time-ness is more important than the event-handler-ness

[18:33] <TimToady> though it would be nice to express both somehow

[20:07] <jnthn> japhb___: What made it official? :)

[20:07] <japhb___> Give me a sec, I'll gist.

[20:07] <tadzik> good morning #perl6

[20:08] <timotimo> hey tadzik, how are you?

[20:08] <tadzik> pretty good :)

[20:08] <tadzik> vacations are nice, I should do more of those

[20:09] <jnthn> morning? :)

[20:09] <tadzik> ymmv :P

[20:10] <timotimo> ytzmv? ;)

[20:10] <tadzik> that too :)

[20:11] <japhb> jnthn: https://gist.github.com/japhb/7473529

[20:13] <jnthn> ooh :)

[20:14] <japhb> Yeah, cool, huh?  This makes me happy.

[20:15] * timotimo is kinda sad he probably won't be breaking the 100 seconds barrier for parrot setting parse time before the release

[20:15] <tadzik> very cool

[20:15] <lue> jnthn: I have two quick questions: 1) I can make my own nqp:: ops for use with the <O()> rule, right? 2) How would I deal with an operator that has multiple forms (e.g. + for integers and + for lists)? (Rakudo's grammar isn't too helpful there.) Would I need to move beyond simple actions/grammar, or...?

[20:16] <timotimo> do you already know at parse-time if you have a list or an integer?

[20:16] *** iSlug joined
[20:16] <timotimo> of course you do if it's a literal, but what about variables?

[20:17] <TimToady> and why would you want to do that?

[20:17] <lue> timotimo: at the moment I'm not implementing variables, so yes I would know. (But not forever, admittedly.)

[20:18] *** raiph left
[20:20] <jnthn> lue: You can register custom ops for your language but it's often easier just to give your language a "setting" or similar and leave the code-gen to produce a call to the op.

[20:21] <lue> I get the feeling it would be better implemented going beyond O() and friends. (There's only one precedence level and parens, so it wouldn't be too bad :P)

[20:21] <jnthn> lue: For multi-form operators, you'll probably need to code-gen a call that dispatches by type, either using multi-dispatch or just nqp::istype to decide. Really depends on the langauge.

[20:21] <lue> jnthn: it's APLish :)

[20:21] <jnthn> lue: You still use O, you just don't do :op<...?

[20:21] <jnthn> lue: Instead you leave it alone and it code-gens a call to e.g. &infix:<foo> automatically

[20:22] <jnthn> Taking the name from the <sym>

[20:22] <jnthn> Or something along those lines. :)

[20:22] <lue> jnthn: yeah, I noticed rakudo does that towards the end of Grammar.nqp, but I couldn't tell what was supposed to happen after the Grammar

[20:22] <jnthn> Or you can write an action method and make it do just what you want.

[20:22] * lue thinks APL has function definition stuff suitable for a setting. He checks

[20:25] <lue> yeah. So I think what I have to do is implement ∇ (function definition) so I can get started on a setting as soon as possible. (Setting seems the natural way to go anyway) :)

[20:25] *** raiph joined
[20:26] <lue> jnthn: so IIUC, using <O()> without :op<> generates a call to a sub which I've defined in NQP, correct? So the definition of &infix:<foo> would occur elsewhere in the NQP code of the compiler in that case.

[20:28] <jnthn> lue: It just needs to be somehow in the lexical scope of the thing that calls it

[20:28] <jnthn> lue: Which you can arrange setting-style or import-style.

[20:31] <lue> import-style would be 'use' statements or something?

[20:32] <jnthn> yeah

[20:34] <lue> .oO(and here I thought APL would just be a couple dozen operator parse rules. Now I accidentally a setting :) . I'll go look at how NQP and Rakudo and the like get that working before doing it. )

[21:01] <lue> is @$ supposed to be a new sigil, or @-sigil+$-trigil, or @($channel) ?

[21:01] <timotimo> no, it's just @($....)

[21:01] <japhb___> timotimo: On a positive note, every time you shave away at the non-bottleneck, it means that when someone (maybe you) *does* find and fix the bottleneck, it will be a huge win.

[21:02] <timotimo> percentage-wise, yeah

[21:02] <japhb___> And sometimes you have to scrape away the small problems before you can uncover the big ones.

[21:16] * PerlJam is going to have to read S17 (probably a few times) because that commit is a tad indecipherable

[21:17] <timotimo> yeah, S17 is a bit opaque. you have to leave all your preconceptions at the door

[21:19] <jnthn> TimToady: Something feels a bit off with that, but I'm not quite sure what...

[21:19] <TimToady> yeah, just meant to be closer

[21:19] <jnthn> combine is a better name.

[21:19] <TimToady> needs different topicalization or something

[21:20] <TimToady> at one point was passing in the instantiable data as $a => @as but that didn't feel even righter

[21:20] <japhb> I read that as "insatiable data"

[21:20] <TimToady> but the basic idea that it's a bit of generic code to be instantiated over two (or more) supplies (or channels?)

[21:21] <timotimo> TimToady: did i have your blessing to compare signatures in the spectests by strings, or should i implement :(Mu *@) to work as a special case?

[21:21] <jnthn> japhb: Hah, I want to give a talk with that title now :P

[21:42] <TimToady> most languages just throw up their hands at the notion of comparing signatures deeply

[21:43] <TimToady> you'd need a fairly circumscribed call syntax and type system to get around that; something you could do in Prolog but not in Perl

[21:43] <TimToady> (and it's probably too hard to do right in Prolog too :)

[21:58] <timotimo> jnthn: can you explain to me why the pir generator builds lots of "get_sc_object $P5001, "uaidtrenuiadtren", 1234" and directly afterwards "set $P100, 5001"? i made an 'optimisation' that directly puts the second register into the first instruction and it b0rked with NPMCA :(

[22:00] <diakopter> timotimo: I guess it wanted to use P5001 later also?

[22:00] <timotimo> but i set :returns to the same register, too, and that's the only mechanism how the caller could have figure dout what register that was supposed to be

[22:00] <diakopter> timotimo: also, be sure to change the "result register" of the expression

[22:01] <diakopter> ok

[22:01] <timotimo> i don't think i really looked at the resulting code, though

[22:01] * diakopter throws you a look

[22:01] <timotimo> thanks, i'll use that

[22:04] <timotimo> i can reconstruct it quickly, though

[22:06] <jnthn> timotimo: Are you sure that the $P100 isn't actually a lexical-holding register?

[22:06] <timotimo> it is

[22:06] <timotimo> can only set put things into lexical-holding registers?

[22:06] <jnthn> No, should be fine to directly put them in too...

[22:07] <timotimo> that's what i thought :(

[22:07] <timotimo> well, i'll see what the code looks like exactly and then i'll see

[22:07] *** BenGoldberg joined
[22:10] <timotimo> i think i may actually have implemented it subtly differently this time

[23:08] <perigrin> http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/e/edsgerdijk201169.html

[23:08] <perigrin> Go is too new.

[23:09] <perigrin> but I thought of Go pretty much immediately too :)

[23:09] <timotimo> a friend told me "go is a better pythonic language than python"

[23:10] <timotimo> or a "more pythonic language"

[23:11] <geekosaur> go might, however, be python in google's image...

[23:15] <perigrin> Go is Python as if it were written by Rob Pike.

[23:52] *** btyler left
[23:52] <japhb> So perhaps str native attrs don't get built properly ....

[23:53] <japhb> TimToady, what is the native of a Str supposed to be, if not a str?

[23:53] * TimToady still thinks the concept "native" is overly generic and leads to things like "str" types that mean different things in different lands

[23:54] * TimToady has no clue what a "str" is supposed to be

[23:54] <japhb> Which is to say, if you're creating the Str class itself, how do you specify the underlying VM thing that's holding the string contents?

[23:54] <TimToady> nor what "native" means in that context

[23:55] <TimToady> everywhere else, "native" is currently meaning "like in C", but C has no string types

[23:55] <japhb> For me, "native" means "the form that the VM ops work on"

[23:55] <TimToady> so a completely non-portable concept that should probably have different names on different platforms

[23:55] <japhb> I can see "like in C" for *sized* natives, but the generic natives surely are VM-specific, no?

[23:56] <japhb> TimToady, that answer is a bit negative when it comes to writing the non-VM-specific parts of Rakudo

[23:56] <TimToady> and what do you mean by "native" if C and the VM are in disagreement on a particular matchine?

[23:56] <japhb> Perhaps we're talking past each other.

[23:57] <japhb> For me, I see num64 == C double, num32 == C float.  But num == whatever the VM wants it to be.

[23:57] <japhb> And I apply the same logic to int and str.

[23:57] <TimToady> I'm just saying that "native" is a nebulous concept that causes people to apply the same logic where it doesn't make sense :)

[23:58] <japhb> I concede that point.

[23:58] <japhb> And now I want to find a practical solution.

[23:58] <TimToady> to a nebulous type defined by rakudo but not by Perl 6?  :P

[23:59] * TimToady has not opinion on that subject :)

[23:59] <TimToady> *no

[23:59] <diakopter> TimToady: native just means .. oh nm :)
