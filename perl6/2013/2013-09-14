[07:05] <timotimo> wow nice

[07:05] <timotimo> i can pay up 3 euros to get "some more"

[07:05] <timotimo> no idea how much i get for that

[08:08] <moritz> good morning

[08:08] <timotimo> hello moritz

[08:08] <moritz> I hope somebody takes notes, and makes some comprehensive blog posts or docs out of them

[08:09] <timotimo> we have an audio recording and coke offered to transcribe it

[08:09] <moritz> \o/

[08:09] <moritz> does jnthn have slides? or does he browse through the relevant code pieces?

[08:10] <timotimo> he has slides and we have print-outs

[08:10] <timotimo> and there's some shells and some pointing at source code

[08:10] *** domidumont left
[08:11] <timotimo> maybe we should be taking a screenshot of jnthns desktop every 5 seconds and play that at the same time as the audio or something?

[08:12] *** domidumont joined
[08:12] <timotimo> we are about to write our own compiler to replace rakudo

[08:12] <timotimo> at this workshop, we are going to make perl6 and rakudo obsolete

[08:57] <tadzik> for every language community, there's at least one other language community that laughs at it

[08:59] <timotimo> that seems fair

[09:01] <timotimo> well, except python i guess, because NO LOL

[09:01] <tadzik> so: for every language community, there's at least one other language community that laughs at it, except python, which doesn't LOL

[09:02] <timotimo> ah, right, that doesn't require every language community to laugh about any specific number of other communities

[09:06] <moritz> what language does the cobol community laugh at?

[09:06] <tadzik> . o O ( dead people don't laugh )

[09:07] <timotimo> they laugh about all other language communities because nobody makes as much money as them

[09:07] <tadzik> hah

[09:07] <tadzik> wiping off their tears with dollars

[09:07] <timotimo> if nqp doesn't have pairs, what is $_ in this?

[09:11] <timotimo> why not look at the source of <anon> and find out? :)

[09:17] <timotimo> we should have made a stencil on github for "attend RaNIW"

[10:39] <timotimo> is openid dying?

[10:39] <moritz> maybe

[10:39] <tadzik> the last one I used stopped working and I lost my SO account

[10:39] <tadzik> not falling for that thing again :|

[10:40] <timotimo> how did you lose your account?

[10:40] <timotimo> did you misbehave? :p

[10:40] <tadzik> I don't have that openid anymore

[10:40] <tadzik> because that openid's dead

[10:40] <timotimo> oh, crap

[10:41] <tadzik> I could go to SO now and say "hey, I was the owner of that account. I have no proof, but I really was"

[10:41] <timotimo> so there's still a reason to associate a classic email address thing to accounts made like that :|

[10:41] <timotimo> well, openid wants to be decentralised anyway

[10:42] <tadzik> thing is, when you use it everywhere, you centralize yourself with this openid

[10:42] <tadzik> (if you know what I mean)

[10:42] <tadzik> of course, otherwise you cetralize yourself with an email

[10:42] <tadzik> so it's the same, really

[10:43] <timotimo> yeah

[10:43] <tadzik> but everytime I used openid, the site was like "oh, you have openid? Cool, now open an account here linked with that openid!"

[10:43] <timotimo> totally what you want, right?

[10:43] <tadzik> so the only thing I don't need is a new password

[10:43] <tadzik> which doesn't matter, because I don't remember any of my passwords anyway

[19:52] *** FROGGS left
[19:53] <moritz> not all of us :(

[19:54] <poor_soul> i was testing moarvm and got a failing test during 'make test', is someone interested?

[19:54] *** denisboyun left
[19:55] <moritz> maybe in #moarvm

[19:55] <poor_soul> will they be there?

[19:56] *** cooper left
[19:56] * moritz has no idea

[19:56] <moritz> but #moarvm is also logged

[20:00] <[Coke]> ah. it's easy to catch on logs when so many people are here in person.

[20:02] * moritz puts some more logs into the fire

[20:04] * flussence misread those 2 lines as "catch on fire when..."

[20:48] <timotimo> https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/parrot/ops/nqp.ops#L2351 - first: why is *ch created and not used? is decontainerize mutating? is the method incomplete? second: what two objects am i supposed to pass in? which of the locals in this code https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/src/vm/parrot/QAST/Compiler.nqp#L986 are applicable? third: why am i getting "No registered operation handler for 'attrhintfor'", even though i put ...

[20:48] <timotimo> ... QAST::Operations.add_core_pirop_mapping('attrhintfor', 'repr_hint_for', 'IPPs', :inlinable(1)); into QAST/Operations.nqp

[20:49] <sorear> your code not being loaded when you expect it to?

[20:49] *** sqirrel joined
[20:49] <timotimo> of course

[20:50] <timotimo> i added the operation, but *of course* it's not in the stage0

[20:50] <timotimo> *thank you*!

[21:16] <timotimo> i will have to continue working on that tomorrow

[21:16] <diakopter> pmurias: I was thinking yaml of sorts, so you can clearly-ish see the pointers

[21:19] <tadzik> I declare https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew useful and usable for early adopters

[21:19] <tadzik> it can build rakudo for both VMs in any version, switch between any versions of any backends, install panda on any backend

[21:20] <tadzik> seems to be pretty useful

[21:20] <diakopter> ingy: ^

[21:20] <tadzik> working on it, I also noticed that while one can run perl6 outside of rakudo-jvm directory, it is not so for nqp

[21:20] <tadzik> (nqp on jvm, that is)

[21:29] <tadzik> colomon: it's all easy with rakudobrew \o/

[21:30] <pmurias> diakopter: my experience with dumping complex treeish compiler stuff in yaml is that it gets confusing

[21:30] <tadzik> I'm now making it fill the role of pandabrew as well

[21:31] <pmurias> diakopter: as yaml uses indentation and craziness instead of punctuation

[21:31] <tadzik> I guess it should be possible to make rakudobrew build both implementations in two OS processes :)

[21:39] <tadzik> IO.copy() different between parrot and jvm: https://gist.github.com/tadzik/6565882

[21:40] <tadzik> trivial to fix, I think, but it's long past sleeptime to me anyway

[21:40] <tadzik> will do that tomorrow unless someone gets to it first

[22:01] *** cognominal left
[22:02] <ingy> I like that coffeescript and livescript make yaml look syntax-heavy

[22:18] <pmurias> ingy: when trying to determin if I should access my data as [1]{foo}[3][4][0][0][2] or [1]{foo}[3][4][0][2] I prefer the extra syntax ;)
