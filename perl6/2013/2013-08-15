[04:17] <japhb> .tell pmurias I noticed I was highlighted re: startup time issues with perl6-bench -- Thanks to pmichaud++, perl6-bench goes through some pains to determine both the global *interpreter/VM* startup time, measured by running an empty program many times, and *compile/init* startup time for each scalable test individually, measured by running the test at SCALE=0, as timotimo says.  This resulted in much more reliable and comparable results.

[04:17] <yoleaux> japhb: I'll pass your message to pmurias.

[04:19] <japhb> (That said, I'm very much open to pull requests from anyone who figures out a better way.)

[04:21] <japhb> As for the in-proc v. out-of-proc question, across VMs and implementations I think the only way to be fair is to allow the results to be presented either with startup time included or excluded, so that users can consider whether startup time matters for their use case.

[04:22] <japhb> (and of course that's exactly what perl6-bench does)

[18:58] <nwc10> had traffic been evil, we would not have had 45 minutes

[19:00] <dalek> rakudo/nom: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/5f460187c8

[19:00] <timotimo> because channels are about lists, so are they flattening or list-of-lists?

[19:01] <jnthn> timotimo: You can send whatever you want down a Channel; the impl doesn't enforce a context on the things in the channel at the moment

[19:01] <jnthn> If you want to send arrays down there, it's just fine

[19:02] <jnthn> Or objects, or hashes, or... :)

[19:02] <nwc10> closures?

[19:02] <jnthn> Yes if you're careful :P

[19:03] <jnthn> nwc10: Just remember that if you pass multiple closures that manipulated outer state you could be in hot water with sharing.

[19:04] <nwc10> mmmm. food should be in hot water. Not me. I am not food. I will be careful.

[19:04] <PerlJam> jnthn: i'm curious about nth_or_timeout(4),  why "last" out of the loop instead of "return $p"?  also, does the keep not execute when you do: $p.break(); $p.keep(); because the promise has already been broken?

[19:04] <jnthn> As there's no promise that only one thing is pulling from the queueue and executing the closures

[19:04] <nwc10> yes. aha. fun.

[19:05] <jnthn> PerlJam: You can't return 'cus you're in an async

[19:05] *** spider-mario left
[19:05] <jnthn> The routine returns "immediately", async only schedules that block to run in the thread pool

[19:06] <PerlJam> er, expecting

[19:06] <jnthn> There's not one, at least nothing spec'd.

[19:07] <jnthn> async in void context needs to actually deliver its exceptions somewhere

[19:07] <jnthn> That's on my "loose ends to tie up" list. Like many things. :)

[19:08] *** crab2313 joined
[19:09] <pmurias> jnthn: is it possible to cross compile with QRegex::P6Regex?

[19:10] <jnthn> I guess it can be set up...

[19:11] <jnthn> I never tried it, but it knows how to work as a standalone thing, so it should be just like setting up NQP to cross-compile, for example.

[19:12] <pmurias> it uses a NQPRoutine at one point

[19:12] <pmurias> which can't be serialized

[19:12] <jnthn> It..can't?

[19:13] <pmurias> well it can, but it is taken from the setting of the compiler

[19:13] <jnthn> oh, hm, I guess it's possible it's never been used to generate bytecode, just in-process

[19:13] <pmurias> the thing I actually want to do is run the tests in nqp/t/qregex

[19:14] <jnthn> Oh, I never even attempted those until post-bootstrap

[19:14] <jnthn> It needs eval really

[19:14] <jnthn> So I just left them until bootstrap was done and it's easy then :)

[19:14] <jnthn> It'd need a fairly different harness-y thing to cross-compile them, I suspect

[19:15] <pmurias> I would prefer to know my grammars work correctly before bootstraping

[19:16] <pmurias> jnthn: I could create a different harnessy-y think which just translates the regexes to nqp code, which I can compile

[19:16] <jnthn> I was comfortable enough with the basic tests in t/nqp and the fact that I had a selfhost that passed t/nqp :)

[19:17] <jnthn> If you can parse all the t/nqp with your grammar engine running the NQP grammar, probably it works quite well ;)

[19:17] <jnthn> But yes, if you like, you can create a different harness

[19:23] <timotimo> oh

[19:23] <timotimo> i meant in a *specific* other thread

[19:23] <timotimo> anyway. jnthn, can you figure out why Rakudo::Debugger is failing to run? it failed to build before, but that was just a matter of removing perl6_group (or what is it called?) from the makefile and leaving only perl6_ops (or something like that)

[19:29] <timotimo> yes, rakudo parrot; didn't look at jvm yet

[19:29] <timotimo> i was just assuming it would hit some little roadblock that would leave me completely stumped

[19:31] <pmurias> jnthn: arrays in nqp have to provide a .push method?

[19:31] <timotimo> jnthn: did you see my results from turning add/sum/mul_n into add/sub/mul_i if it can be proven to be correct?

[19:31] <nwc10> ivanoff: I don't think that they are up anywhere yet. At least, I've not heard anyone say anything

[19:32] <timotimo> jnthn: summary: on one benchmark (two dimensional loop with native ints) it got 300% improvement (yes, 4x more runs per second) on jvm and 30% improvement on parrot

[19:33] <ivanoff> nwc10: Thanks! I found only couple videos, so... still looking for... ))

[19:35] <jnthn> pmurias: Yes; you can nab code from NQPMu.nqp for that (NQPArray class)

[19:35] <jnthn> pmurias: It's literally method push($thing) { nqp::push(self, $thing) }

[19:35] <jnthn> timotimo: Not had chance to loook at that yet

[19:36] <jnthn> Still catching up a bit after YAPc :)

[19:36] <pmurias> jnthn: it's the only part of the nqp setting that's commented out in nqp-js ;)

[19:36] <jnthn> pmurias: ah :)

[19:36] <timotimo> my next attempt was to turn lexicals into locals which was supposedly easier on nqp, but i stumbled into some roadblocks there, too ... stopped after a bit of frustration, but if you have a few spare minutes for me some time, i can prepare some targetted questions and get going again

[19:36] <jnthn> pmurias: What's it block on, ooc?

[19:37] <pmurias> ooc?

[19:37] <timotimo> "out of curiosity"

[19:37] <pmurias> I'm using native javascript arrays for nqp arrays.

[19:38] <jnthn> oh.

[19:38] <jnthn> yes, you actually need the VMArray REPR.

[19:38] <jnthn> Relied on not only here, but in Rakudo too

[19:40] <pmurias> I should propably to that, and worry about performance once everything is working

[20:54] <berekuk> how about "setup smoke testing"? (not sure if it exists for rakudo)

[20:54] <timotimo> haha, when googling for "play perl" i get two kinds of results: "play perl is awesome and famous!" and "how to play a sound with perl"

[20:54] <[Coke]> for the rakudo ones, probably best to start with "things not marked testneeded" and "least recently modified first"

[20:54] <timotimo> not "where can i find and use play perl?"

[20:54] * [Coke] tries play perl early on but hasn't been back.

[20:55] <[Coke]> *tried

[20:55] <timotimo> well, there's already a rosettacode data github repo where all scripts are present as files

[20:55] *** Pleiades` left
[20:55] <timotimo> that should make smoke testing easier

[20:55] *** kaare_ left
[20:55] <timotimo> just have to write a short little harness for each of the scripts that complains if the result is not as expected

[20:56] <berekuk> timotimo: it's called "questhub" now, and yes, it has SEO issues

[20:56] <timotimo> ah, that's what it is!

[20:56] <masak> timotimo: I'm interested in helping with that.

[20:56] <[Coke]> timotimo: see roast/rosettacode

[20:57] <[Coke]> which was my horrible initial attempt before that RC repo showed up.

[20:59] <berekuk> masak: if you register on QH, I'll make you a realm keeper for Perl realm, and you'll be able to add these tasks to the list yourself (here's the full list: http://questhub.io/realm/perl/stencils, as you can see, it's mostly about perl5, which is a shame)

[20:59] <timotimo> if my train ride tomorrow lasted 10 hours, i would probably do it :P

[20:59] <timotimo> but it only lasts 1, so i'll read a book instead i guess

[21:00] <berekuk> heh

[21:00] *** Pleiades` joined
[21:00] <masak> berekuk: sounds good. I'll register.

[21:03] <masak> berekuk: done. I'm 'masak' there now.

[21:04] <berekuk> masak: grants, errm, granted, you should see the "New stencil" on stencils page now

[21:04] <berekuk> you can also edit other stencils, e.g. "Try Rakudo" one

[21:05] <masak> berekuk: yup. I see it.

[21:08] *** PZt left
[21:12] * moritz is home again

[21:13] <timotimo> ah, stencils are like a template that you can fill out to create a new quest?

[21:13] <timotimo> hm, no, they are more like ... an instruction?

[21:14] <timotimo> nope, i don't know what they are

[21:15] <berekuk> timotimo: they are both

[21:15] <berekuk> you "take" a stencil and get a quest with description which helps you to complete it

[21:16] <berekuk> if this was a game, they'd just be called "quests" which you take from NPC, but since we already have unique quests (which are just tasks you invent for yourself), it'd be confusing, so I had to invent a new name

[21:19] <timotimo> right

[21:20] <timotimo> so if i like a stencil, can i upvote it and every person who creates a quest from it gets that point by default?

[21:20] <berekuk> timotimo: nope, you can't like a stencil

[21:21] <timotimo> but stencils do have points at the right, how are they increased?

[21:21] <berekuk> we discussed this before - https://github.com/berekuk/questhub/issues/126 - and I think it's not a good idea

[21:21] <timotimo> also, the flattr button is a bit bugged; the mouseover appears to the right of the page

[21:21] <berekuk> realm keeper chooses it (from 1, 2 or 3) :)

[21:21] <timotimo> gotta run now

[21:21] <berekuk> timotimo: oops, right

[21:21] <berekuk> thanks, bye :)

[21:27] <timotimo> this time i managed to get to the tram stop before the tram

[21:27] <timotimo> it was really close last time and this time, too

[21:27] <lue> hmm... would it be correct to think of a QH stencil as a typical game's quest, and a QH quest as someone taking the challenge?

[21:28] <berekuk> yes

[21:30] <timotimo> good argument on that issue

[21:31] <berekuk> I don't know if it's too late to rename, and "challenge" doesn't sound less template-y to me (but I'm not a native speaker)

[21:32] <lue> if you're up for renaming, may I suggest stencil-->quest or mission, and quest-->goal ? ("It is my goal to complete this quest/mission")

[21:32] <lue> (not that it's hard to learn what the existing terms mean)

[21:33] <berekuk> I might as well replace "goal" with conventional and boring "task"

[21:33] <timotimo> is it hard to get sign up with github going?

[21:33] <berekuk> I'm not sure I'm up for renaming, but I know "stencil" word confuses many people

[21:33] <timotimo> or is your use of sign up with twitter deeper than just sso?

[21:34] <berekuk> no, not very hard. I just didn't paid attention to that task since we got email signups long time ago

[21:34] <berekuk> twitter is just for auth and userpic

[21:35] <timotimo> i would think a more wordy explanation of stencils on the front page would be a very good start

[21:35] <berekuk> is the sidebar explanation confusing too?

[21:35] <berekuk> the one on http://questhub.io/realm/perl/stencils

[21:36] <timotimo> just mentioning the word stencil rather than just the icon would maybe be enough

[21:36] <berekuk> oh, right, thanks, that could help

[21:37] <timotimo> chore or errands could be a different term although they have negative connotations to me

[21:37] <timotimo> but yes, the sidebar explanation is good

[21:38] <berekuk> heh, we went through many words (http://questhub.io/realm/meta/quest/51db41b85a854b176100002b), they all sucked

[21:38] <berekuk> "stencil" just sucked a bit less

[21:41] <timotimo> i likevthe way stencil sounds

[21:41] <timotimo> it is such a physical word

[21:44] <berekuk> yes. the issue is with connotations, people make assumptions about how it should work, and it's not intuitive

[21:44] <berekuk> maybe I should've just chosen the random string of characters as a name :)

[21:45] <lue> r: say ("a".."z").roll(6)

[21:46] <masak> 'night, #perl6

[21:47] <lue> "challenge" (which you mentioned earlier) seems like a nice alternative if necessary. But "stencil" works fine, after a small explanation.

[21:47] <lue> ♞, masak o/

[21:48] <berekuk> lue: the issue is that you can't tell which one of "challenge" and "quest" is a template and which one is an instance

[21:51] <lue> Hm. I can see why it was a bother for you guys to name these things :) .

[21:51] <timotimo> i get to choose a username after i click "sign in with twitter", rights

[21:51] <timotimo> ?

[21:52] <berekuk> yep

[21:53] <berekuk> timotimo: "sign in with email" uses persona, so it's SSO too, if you prefer it (if you're on gmail, you won't have to invent the new password either way)

[21:54] <timotimo> i don't really use gmail, although i do have it.

[22:04] <timotimo> there's still lots of mention of "Play Perl" on the about page, most of them are from the titles of articles, but there's "Play Perl Realm" twice on the page; i suggest replacing "Play Perl Realm" with just "the Perl Realm" and adding a short paragraph about how questhub was called play perl before above the testimonials

[22:12] <timotimo> don't worry about it :)

[22:12] <berekuk> will fix it tomorrow

[22:13] <timotimo> i thought it might have been one of these pesky bugs that you only see in one browser if it has one exact configuration etc etc.

[22:13] <berekuk> actually

[22:13] <berekuk> up/down button should work

[22:13] <berekuk> it's "?" button that's broken

[22:13] <berekuk> up/down starts working if you enter any text, it switches the preview box

[22:14] <timotimo> er, the "start quest" button doesn't work :o

[22:15] <berekuk> now *that* shouldn't happen

[22:15] <berekuk> have you selected a realm on the left?

[22:15] <timotimo> turned off adblock plus, reloaded, still won't react to clicks

[22:15] <timotimo> ooooh

[22:15] <timotimo> no, i have not

[22:28] <timotimo> i've got a couple more quests to add, but i need to sleep so i can catch my train "early" tomorrow

[22:31] <timotimo> should we perhaps add a "join #perl6 on freenode and chat about your experiences and expectations" to the "try rakudo perl6" stencil?

[22:32] *** benabik left
[22:32] <berekuk> timotimo: I don't think it should be mandatory, but if it's just an advice, then good

[22:32] <berekuk> I made you a realm keeper too :)

[22:33] <berekuk> (I don't like how many of us are there already, and that's not what I had in mind, "keeper" is more of a moderator position, but whatever.)

[22:33] <berekuk> so you can edit it yourself

[22:34] <timotimo> oh god, now i have to come up with a good wording of it :|

[22:34] <timotimo> i'll do it tomorrow or later

[22:34] <timotimo> for now, i'll really go to bed.

[22:35] <berekuk> good night

[22:35] <timotimo> in the players list, the "open quests" number on the right is black, but on the stencils list it is orange ... minor nitpick :)
