[07:16] *** smace joined
[07:18] <FROGGS[mobile]> *g*

[07:22] <labster> Actually, I just like the word 'moar'.  I've used it enough in text messages that my iPhone helpfully suggests it when I misspell it.

[07:24] <tadzik> it's a nice pun too

[07:24] * masak .oO( a... pun? ) :P

[07:25] *** trexy joined
[07:26] <trexy> I'm preparing a presentation today and I've got a couple of questions ... anyone about?

[07:27] <tadzik> Parrot wanted to run moar dynamic languages, moar is trying to parrot the way it runs rakudo

[07:27] <masak> trexy: we're about. ask away.

[07:27] <trexy> Hey Masak - cool

[07:27] <masak> tadzik: I doubt anyone thought of it that way. your brain is a pretzel :P

[07:28] <trexy> i'd like to cite this example in a presentation - I'd like to understand what is going on first - http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Inverted_index#Perl_6

[07:28] <tadzik> masak: is it good or bad? :)

[07:30] <masak> tadzik: depends, I guess, (a) if you like pretzels, and (b) if you're a zombie.

[07:30] <FROGGS[mobile]> tadzik: if you are rolling (?) the r in parrot like in "that parrot is dead" then it will be good :p

[07:30] <trexy> so - *@files in MAIN - how do you read that? - slurp in a list of files from the command line into the @files list

[07:30] <masak> trexy: yeah.

[07:30] <trexy> and the  Whatever *?

[07:30] *** JimmyZ left
[07:32] <masak> in a signature, the * means "slurp".

[07:32] <masak> that is "put as many arguments as you have into this parameter".

[07:32] <trexy> great - that makes sense

[07:32] <masak> \o/

[07:33] <FROGGS[mobile]> perl6 implicit understanding...

[07:34] *** ggoebel left
[07:34] <trexy> ok so - it then iterates through each file - slurping in the full contents of each file and lowercasing everything 

[07:35] <trexy> where "words" is tokenising the input?

[07:35] <masak> yeah.

[07:35] <masak> .words does .comb(/\S+/)

[07:35] <trexy> ah ok cool

[07:35] *** smace left
[07:35] <trexy> now -- the big question ... 

[07:35] <masak> (you saved the big question?) :P

[07:36] <trexy> haha ... now the metaoperator X 

[07:36] <trexy> applied to =>

[07:36] <trexy> what's going on there?

[07:37] <masak> oh, that one's pretty nice.

[07:37] *** ochoEight joined
[07:37] <masak> "kay $file aganst all individual words as values".

[07:37] <masak> key*

[07:38] <masak> r: my $file = "foo"; my @words = <a b c d>; say ($file X=> @words).perl

[07:38] <camelia> rakudo cd5ca7: OUTPUT«("foo" => "a", "foo" => "b", "foo" => "c", "foo" => "d").list␤»

[07:38] <trexy> cool - I thought it was doing something like that

[07:38] <trexy> can't run this example as I'm on a prehistoric version of rakudo

[07:39] <Timbus> hm

[07:39] <Timbus> r: my $file = "foo"; my @words = <a b c d>; say ($file >>=>>> @words).perl

[07:39] <camelia> rakudo cd5ca7: OUTPUT«("foo" => "a",).list␤»

[07:39] <Timbus> r: my $file = "foo"; my @words = <a b c d>; say ($file >>=><< @words).perl

[07:40] <camelia> rakudo cd5ca7: OUTPUT«("foo" => "a", "foo" => "b", "foo" => "c", "foo" => "d").list␤»

[07:40] <trexy> ok - so this is hash is then returned from the the  "do" and pushed onto results 

[07:40] <Timbus> there we go. much uglier

[07:40] *** ggoebel joined
[07:41] <trexy> hmm - not getting what is happening here:

[07:41] <trexy>     (my %norm).push: do for @files -> $file {

[07:44] <masak> "create a hash, push these pairs into it".

[07:44] <masak> now, .push to a hash has a bit special semantics, that's what the code is after.

[07:44] <masak> ...but I've gotta run to an airplane; someone else better take over the explanation ;)

[07:44] <moritz> note that a for loop returns a list of values that the block returned

[07:45] <trexy> thanks Masak - safe flight

[07:45] <trexy> ok Moritz - got it I think

[07:45] <Timbus> Hash.push is one of my most favoritest things

[07:46] <trexy> OK - almost there now

[07:46] <trexy> the for loop is returning a list of pairs

[07:47] <trexy> the each pairs is pushed onto the hash

[07:47] <trexy> .push: <- what is going on with the colon

[07:47] <trexy> ?

[07:48] <moritz> it says "what follows are arguments for the method"

[07:48] <trexy> yep - ok thought so

[07:49] <trexy> and the first argument to push is a list - generated by the for loop

[07:49] <masak> &

[07:49] <trexy> hmmm or the do?

[07:51] <moritz> generated by the do for

[07:52] <moritz> 'for' normally is a statement; 'do' turns it into an expression

[07:52] *** ochoEight left
[07:53] * tadzik flies

[07:57] <trexy> ok so when you see a "do" in this context - how do you read in your mind?

[07:59] <Timbus> 'do this, give result'

[08:01] *** risou is now known as risou_awy

[08:02] *** risou_awy is now known as risou

[08:03] <trexy> thanks Timbus

[10:02] <tadzik> the beginning of checkin?

[10:02] <FROGGS[mobile]> yes

[10:02] <tadzik> well, better not wait for me

[10:02] <tadzik> I'm flying the virgin flight of the new Dreamliner

[10:02] <tadzik> I seat near the emergency exit, Justin Case

[10:02] <FROGGS[mobile]> were do you stay this night?

[10:02] <tadzik> in austin

[10:03] <FROGGS[mobile]> ahh, k

[10:04] <FROGGS[mobile]> I'm at the rodeway inn, which is pretty close

[10:04] <timotimo> so, with the newer rakudo, there's no way to make a gather for or gather map lazy? :(

[10:04] <tadzik> er, how can gather not be lazy?

[10:04] <timotimo> ah, binding

[10:04] <FROGGS[mobile]> timotimo: no idea

[10:04] <timotimo> forgot to :

[10:04] <tadzik> a list assignment is eager

[10:05] <timotimo> yeah. didn't sleep so good i fear

[10:05] <FROGGS[mobile]> how is gulasch going?

[10:06] <FROGGS[mobile]> timotimo: I hope your bed isnt under water :/

[10:08] <timotimo> it isn't, but the rest of the city is

[10:08] <FROGGS[mobile]> tadzik: we cant meet at the jfk cause you have to fetch your luggadge when I am alteady boarding

[10:08] <tadzik> I have no luggage

[10:08] <tadzik> besides hand luggage

[10:08] <FROGGS[mobile]> k

[10:08] <timotimo> the closer i get to my talk, the lamer my slides seem to feel

[10:09] * tadzik hugs timotimo

[10:09] <FROGGS[mobile]> timotimo: yeah, I think I know what you mean

[10:10] <timotimo> there's so much stuff i'd love to show, but all i seem to do is show off the most basic stuff that everybody has already seen in other languages

[10:10] <tadzik> what's your talk?

[10:11] <timotimo> it'll be 1 hour of semi-unorganised perl6 'goodies'

[10:11] <tadzik> ossum

[10:11] <tadzik> on monday?

[10:11] <timotimo> today at 1800

[10:11] <tadzik> ah

[10:11] <timotimo> i spent most of my time preparing a framework to do the presentation properly with, but i'm sure it was time well invested. it's quite flashy

[10:12] <FROGGS[mobile]> tadzik: he is at the GPN in germany

[10:13] <tadzik> I see

[10:13] <timotimo> wasn't there an amusing recronym of "Cool" at one point?

[10:15] <tadzik> there was

[10:16] <tadzik> I think it said something about 'object oriented' ;)

[10:17] <tadzik> layer?

[10:17] <tadzik> convenient?

[10:21] <timotimo> ah, that sounds about right

[10:22] <timotimo>     Cool        Perl 6 Convenient OO Loopbacks

[10:22] <tadzik> :)

[10:22] <tadzik> close enough

[10:22] <timotimo> a class can ~~ a role, even if it doesn't explicitly does/but the exact role in question, is that right?

[16:00] *** spider-mario joined
[16:00] <sorear> and the travel channel thinks it's the world's 10th most dangerous, too (mostly for that reason)

[16:01] <colomon> hard to believe it's the *world*'s 10th most dangerous.

[16:01] <nwc10> curious. Gatwick merrily claims "has the world's busiest single-use runway with up to 53 aircraft movements per hour in late-2012 and a maximum capacity of 55 movements per hour"

[16:01] <nwc10> that's a different excuse for a stat

[16:02] * colomon realizes belatedly that it is June

[16:02] <nwc10> European airports usually skew things in their favour by qualifying it as the most X for an international aiport

[16:02] <nwc10> everyone cheats

[16:05] <sorear> colomon: the list was only commercial passenger airports, so no "airstrip outside McMurdo" stuff

[16:06] <colomon> sorear: ah, I was thinking of "third world corrupt dictatorship" airports.  ;)

[16:07] <sorear> I think they might have been excluding "management" type issues, iirc it was mostly "really awful terrain for an airport" things

[16:07] <sorear> but it was entertainment TV, not a reliable source anyway :p

[20:09] <sorear> so I hear you and/or diakopter will be picking lots of people up?

[20:09] <sorear> Hah

[20:09] <pmichaud> I could practically pick you up from DFW and you could ride with me to AUS :)

[20:09] <sorear> If we'd coordinated better ... yeah

[20:09] <pmichaud> I'm not slated to pick people up yet, because I don't yet know when I'll be driving to AUS.

[20:10] <pmichaud> I'm an unreliable taxi this week.

[20:10] <sorear> well, gdey and me will be landing at 1705

[20:10] <pmichaud> once I'm in AUS, I can do some taxiing

[20:10] <pmichaud> I'll probably be departing here around 1705

[20:10] <pmichaud> maybe a bit later

[20:10] <pmichaud> so... I'm guessing you're in Terminal B?

[20:11] <sorear> where are you currently?  IIRC you live in Corpus Christi?

[20:11] <pmichaud> I used to live in Corpus Christi, a decade ago.

[20:11] <pmichaud> I now live in Plano.

[20:11] <pmichaud> just north of Dallas

[23:11] <tadzik> there was an insightful talk the other day

[23:11] <tadzik> (the other year, more like)

[23:11] <tadzik> it went along "I moved from Perl to Ruby because syntax, but now I'm back because MooSex::Declare"
