[07:05] <jercos> So say you have a buf8, $foo, is there a clean way to reverse :256[$foo.list]? Obviously one can effectively get the hexdump of the original buf with .base(16), but I don't see a way to create an array out of an int of a given base without manual repeated division of a string, which while functional, is also a tad awkward.

[07:11] <jercos> -> $x is copy {gather repeat {take $x mod 256} while $x div= 256} for example, a practical example of a function that performs the given task.

[07:12] <jercos> though that might be a bit backwards. erm.

[07:14] <jercos> And apparently 4850761783423467784 mod 256 = 264, so I may be misunderstanding the use of mod vs. %

[09:52] * colomon is pondering

[09:53] <colomon> "Dispatches to the infix:<mod> multi most appropriate to the operand types, returning a value of the same type. Not coercive, so fails on differing types."

[10:36] *** sqirrel joined
[10:36] <masak> fax machines are a 20th century technology based on push-style RPC photocopying. needless to say, this scheme was highly vulnerable to abuse, often only limited by the amount of paper available to the receiver device.

[10:37] <masak> authentication mechanisms were minimal or nonexistent.

[10:37] <moritz> and yet traditional business folk trust them more than email

[10:38] <masak> I guess the physical substrate conveys a feeling of safety for some people.

[10:38] *** sqirrel left
[10:39] <moritz> they should just print their emails :-)

[10:39] <masak> many probably do :/

[10:39] * moritz kind of likes that vim's command for printing stuff is ":hardcopy"

[10:41] *** donaldh left
[10:41] * masak likes the insight that in Git's model, "hard links" are indistinguishable from just making a straight copy to some other file!

[10:42] <moritz> erm, no.

[10:42] <moritz> if you do a hard link, and modify one of them, the other auomagically modifies too

[10:42] <moritz> that doesn't happen in git if you do a copy

[10:43] <masak> oh, I meant in terms of storage.

[10:43] <moritz> behavior is the new storage!

[10:43] <moritz> erm, wait. :-)

[10:43] <bonsaikitten> oh, fax ... that is still mandatory because e.g. email isn't legally binding in many jurisdictions

[10:43] <bonsaikitten> can't cancel a contract by email - can do it by fax

[10:44] <bonsaikitten> (and thus email-to-fax gateways were born. mind exploderation!)

[10:44] <masak> moritz: as in, Git doesn't "understand" the difference between "this is a copied file" and "this is a hard-linked file"

[10:45] <masak> bonsaikitten: email-to-fax. it's the law.

[10:45] <jnthn> I think there's even email to snail-mail gateways these days :)

[10:45] <bonsaikitten> masak: yeah... that one is a bit of a mind twister

[10:46] <bonsaikitten> masak: and ironically many places receive faxes electronically only, so ... aargh. the fax is legally in a quantum superposition of being valid and not!

[10:46] * moritz even has an email-to-email gateway!

[10:47] <bonsaikitten> I do have some amusing ideas for using snail mail, fax and email

[18:02] <GlitchMr> Why Any?

[18:02] <GlitchMr> Why not Int?

[18:04] <GlitchMr> And seriously, what's wrong with old behavior ("Cannot get character of empty string")?

[18:05] <GlitchMr> Still, it's better than Perl 5 behavior, where ord "" is 0 (perhaps because C strings internals)?

[18:06] <GlitchMr> (by the way, it seems that .charCodeAt in JavaScript returns NaN in this case, Python throws exception, Ruby throws exception...

[18:09] <GlitchMr> )

[18:15] <pmurias> isn't unspecced behavior assumed to be the same as in Perl 5?

[18:16] *** FROGGS joined
[18:25] <pmurias> failing somehow (like with an exception) seems saner then failing silently

[18:27] <GlitchMr> Well, previous behavior was failing.

[19:49] <GlitchMr> thanks

[19:49] <GlitchMr> Added to Perl 6 changes article

[19:49] <GlitchMr> Also, I have DarkPAN on my computer.

[19:49] <GlitchMr> In shell history.

[19:49] <GlitchMr> I actually was using perl6 -e

[19:50] <GlitchMr> Or even perl6 -ne

[19:50] <GlitchMr> By the way, why perl6 -ne'#blah' is valid, but perl6 -ne '#blah' is not

[19:51] <lizmat> GlitchMr: I have no idea

[19:52] <GlitchMr> I assume I just hit the strange bug.

[19:52] <GlitchMr> That normally wouldn't happen, because nobody else uses Perl 6 as Perl 5.

[19:53] <GlitchMr> Well, ok, I don't use Perl 6 as Perl 5.

[19:53] <GlitchMr> But I use it for oneliners. And it works well.

[19:53] <lizmat> GlitchMr: the change to the Range.new candidate: it was the smallest change to make ranges work with Matches/List/Parcel as the starting point

[19:53] <lizmat> and that was according to spec, so what is the problem ?

[19:53] <lizmat> please note that "$min is copy"

[19:53] <lizmat> so the change is not visible outside

[19:54] <camelia> ..niecza v24-95-ga6d4c5f: OUTPUT«($(1, 2), $(3, 4))␤»

[19:54] <GlitchMr> The problem is that ranges aren't just ranges.

[19:55] <pmurias> are there any tools besides say for debugging grammars in nqp?

[19:55] <GlitchMr> I think some APIs (like minmax) use it to store range of values.

[19:55] <lizmat> Grammar::Debugger ?

[19:55] <GlitchMr> rn: say minmax

[19:55] <camelia> rakudo a13cec, niecza v24-95-ga6d4c5f: OUTPUT«Inf..-Inf␤»

[19:55] <GlitchMr> I'm almost sure that Inf..-Inf is different sort of range.

[19:55] <GlitchMr> And in such range, replacing (1, 2) with 2 could matter.

[19:56] <pmurias> lizmat: isn't that for rakudo?

[19:57] <FROGGS> pmurias: I think so

[19:57] <lizmat> pmurias: duh, yes, sorry, missed the "nqp" bit

[20:10] <bropl> hi, i'm back

[20:11] <lizmat> bropl /o

[20:11] <bropl> i got another question

[20:11] <bropl> this code doesnt do what i thought it should

[20:11] <bropl> say .Str given 'A' ~~ m:i/<[a..z]>/;

[20:12] <bropl> maybe too much perl5?

[20:12] <lizmat> r: say .Str given 'A' ~~ m:i/<[a..z]>/;

[20:12] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«False␤»

[20:12] <bropl> shouldnt it match?

[20:13] <lizmat> r: say 'A' ~~ m:i/<[a..z]>/

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«False␤»

[20:13] <lizmat> r: say ('A' ~~ m:i/<[a..z]>/).perl

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«Bool::False␤»

[20:13] <lue> r: say .Str given 'A' ~~ /<alpha>/

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«A␤»

[20:13] <lizmat> r: say 'a' ~~ m:i/<[a..z]>/

[20:13] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«｢a｣␤␤»

[20:13] <bropl> ooh, is <alpha> a new class?

[20:14] <lizmat> r: say 'a' ~~ m:i/<[A..Z]>/

[20:14] <bropl> i should chech the spec

[20:14] <camelia> rakudo a13cec: OUTPUT«False␤»

[20:14] <lizmat> maybe :i is NYI

[20:14] <FROGGS> lizmat: it is implemented

[20:14] <FROGGS> and I thought I implemented it for ranges

[20:15] <lizmat> so why doesn't it work?

[20:15] <FROGGS> no idea off hand

[20:15] <bropl> can i ask a link to the new classes in spec, i cant seem to find them

[20:15] <FROGGS> ahhh

[20:15] <lue> bropl: the things you can put in <> in regexes are in S05, under "Predefined Subrules"

[20:15] <lue> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html#Predefined_Subrules

[20:15] <bropl> got it, many thanks

[20:16] <FROGGS> lizmat: I implemented it for char classes except ranges

[20:16] <lizmat> ah, so :i is NYI on ranges in char classes

[21:32] <[Coke]> if it's failing on a particular config, let's skip it for that config.

[21:33] <FROGGS> yeah, and breaks on my box and I think on masak's too

[21:34] <[Coke]> I think it is reasonable to have the spec test require a recent impl.

[21:34] <flussence> grr... stupid shell autocomplete. (make t/spec<tab> eats the entire arg)

[21:34] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I am already using my parrot fork, wich will become 5.8 if all goes right

[21:35] <FROGGS> and this one passes, but 5.5 would not pass on my box

[21:35] <[Coke]> I have 5.5 here, works fine, btw.

[21:35] <FROGGS> yeah, I know that it works for lizmat too

[21:35] <diakopter> right, "might" depends on who you are

[21:36] <diakopter> not random factors

[21:36] <diakopter> your system

[21:37] <FROGGS> diakopter: ?

[21:37] <diakopter> the comment was saying "on some systems this will fail until a new version of parrot is realased sometime"

[21:37] <FROGGS> correct

[21:37] <diakopter> I was clarifying the comment to coke

[21:37] <FROGGS> ahh

[21:37] <FROGGS> right, thanks

[21:37] <[Coke]> so let's just leave it as a comment instead of an actual todo until we know what triggers it or it's irrelevant.

[21:38] <[Coke]> (esp since it passes on the daily spec run)

[21:38] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I patched parrot a week ago

[21:38] <FROGGS> so I know why it fails

[21:38] <diakopter> coke: he said that above (that he already fixed it locally)

[21:38] <[Coke]> ... I understand.

[21:39] <FROGGS> I'd say we wait two/three days now, and if nobody complains we leave it that way

[21:40] * lizmat has done enough refactoring for a day and goes to sleep&

[21:40] <[Coke]> nite!
