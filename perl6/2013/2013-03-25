[09:03] <Heather> sorear huh?

[09:03] <Heather> bonsaikitten funniest thing is that I don't know how to remove KDE now, I afraid to affect KDevelop

[09:04] <sorear> Heather: i was one of the 3 members of the original xmonad team

[09:04] <sorear> it's _weird_ seeing how much it took off since I left (0.3-ish)

[09:05] <Heather> sorear why left?

[09:07] <daxim> `rpm -q --requires kdevelop4` says it depends on kdebase4-runtime.  it's not possible to remove KDE and keep KDevelop

[09:07] <Heather> daxim cool -__-'

[09:08] <bonsaikitten> daxim: amusing how people invent package names unrelated to upstream

[09:08] <Heather> daxim but I need to clean other things )

[09:09] <bonsaikitten> "everyone" ?

[09:09] <Heather> I need to remove meta package but I afraid that some fonts / icons etc... let call it unnecessary things, will be removed too

[09:10] <bonsaikitten> Heather: try it and see

[09:10] <Heather> bonsaikitten just emerge -C xxx-meta ?

[12:52] <nwc10> masak: I'm probably biased, but the reasons I like perl 6 are the gradual typing and the first class grammars. And the additional reason I like Rakudo is that it's self hosting

[12:52] <nwc10> heck. Probably a third reason is that the language is designed/intended to be lexically extendible

[12:59] <moritz_> having everything lexically (like imports etc.) is really great

[13:00] <hoelzro> (lexical stuff)++

[13:00] <nwc10> likely that one is key in the long term

[13:01] <nwc10> lexical imports is useful in the medium term

[13:02] <jnthn> Lexical stuff also works out very nicely implementation wise.

[13:02] <jnthn> To the degree that I find anything that doesn't work lexically mostly a nuisance to have to deal with. :)

[13:03] <jnthn> Leading example: packages :)

[13:04] <moritz_> this is kinda amusing, because Back In The Days, lexical classes din't work at all :-)

[13:25] <arnsholt> jnthn: Excellent. I was a bit wary, but it seemed like the only option

[13:25] <arnsholt> I also added a set_elems to REPROps_Positional (and dispatch to that from set_integer_native in sixmodelobject.pmc)

[13:25] <arnsholt> Loosely based on what I found in the JVM stuff

[13:25] <jnthn> *nod*

[13:25] <jnthn> Need an nqp:: op for that

[13:26] <arnsholt> Hehe

[13:27] *** shlomif is now known as rindolf

[13:27] <arnsholt> I could do that. Why not nqp::set_elems, since that's what the REPR method is called?

[13:27] <jnthn> We never put _ in nqp op names ither than the _i, _s, _n suffixes.

[13:27] <jnthn> But nqp::setelems would wfm

[13:28] <arnsholt> Oh, right

[13:28] <arnsholt> Now I see why the Parrot ops and NQP ops differ like that =D

[13:28] <arnsholt> But I can implement that

[13:28] <arnsholt> Should I remove the set_integer_native VTABLE as well? (I guess I should)

[13:29] <jnthn> I think you'll fidn a couple of places in Cusror.nqp that do the assign op on an array

[13:29] <jnthn> And htat'd turn into an nqp::setelems too

[13:29] <arnsholt> Yup

[13:29] <jnthn> Yeah, no need to introduce more v-table things.

[13:30] <arnsholt> Yeah, it was an assign in Cursor that made me implement it

[13:30] <jnthn> yeah, I still have those commant out in nqp-jvm :)

[13:31] <jnthn> Feel free to update things there too, if you have interest. :)

[13:31] <jnthn> OK, back to afk vacation mode :)

[13:31] <arnsholt> Really? I thought I found a call to set_elems in the same place in the JVM stuff

[14:43] <FROGGS_> masak: a 300-point-bonus when you already win with 200 points?

[14:43] *** cognominal joined
[14:43] <masak> yes.

[14:44] <masak> better get consensus to change that rule... :)

[14:44] <masak> or someone will win just by showing up and voting early.

[14:45] <FROGGS_> masak: so, the game is about playing and modifying the game?

[14:45] <masak> indeed.

[14:45] <FROGGS_> so there is no 3d-gfx at all?

[14:45] <FROGGS_> :P

[14:45] <masak> heh.

[14:45] <masak> the patches voted on determine what slightly different variant will be played in the next round.

[14:46] <FROGGS_> do I get extra points for being the first participant?

[14:46] <moritz> so there will be a language that describes the game rules and patches to the rules

[14:47] <masak> more like an API. written in Perl 6.

[14:47] <masak> I don't see why patches couldn't conceptually be git commits.

[14:47] <masak> the game could be backed by a git repo somewhere.

[14:47] <moritz> ah, haven't read to the end yet

[14:47] <masak> proposing a patch would be comitting in a newly-created branch.

[14:48] <masak> winning a vote would merge the branch. (always a fast-forward)

[14:48] <moritz> sounds geeky :-)

[14:48] <FROGGS_> moritz: -10 points!

[14:48] <masak> oh, it is.

[14:48] <FROGGS_> # read to the end

[14:48] <FROGGS_> :o)

[14:49] <moritz> btw I'm against making stuff immutable

[14:49] <FROGGS_> do I loose points for being sarcastic?

[14:49] <moritz> FROGGS_: not at all!

[14:49] <FROGGS_> \o/

[14:49] <masak> the original Nomic had the problem of inexactitude of language. so it had a complicated-ish judging process. a Perl 6 nomic, running the rules, wouldn't have that problem or the need for such a process.

[14:49] <masak> moritz: yeah, "against immutable" is my feeling too. ooc, why are you against it?

[14:50] <FROGGS_> I'm in btw

[14:50] <moritz> masak: because the reviewing process should decide whether stuff can be changed or not

[14:50] <masak> FROGGS_: good to know. it's just a glint in my eye so far. but would be a nice stress-test for Perl 6. :)

[14:50] <moritz> masak: all the power to the players!

[14:50] <masak> :)

[14:50] <masak> I think trying without an immutable layer makes a lot of sense.

[14:51] <masak> now, given what you know about the game, how would a session of this game play out?

[14:51] <masak> how would someone win?

[14:51] <masak> as I said, I've been in two live games, so I know a bit about what happens.

[14:51] *** cognominal left
[14:51] <moritz> probably by others growing tired of monitoring everybody's score

[14:52] <masak> heh.

[14:52] <masak> no, assume sufficiently interested players. that isn't always the case, but the assumption makes the question more interesting.

[14:52] <masak> I almost said "sufficiently rational players", but that's not quite it.

[14:53] <moritz> well, one option to win is to slowly accumulate points, and have all the others dead-lock each other so that they can't reach an agreement to stop you

[14:53] <masak> yup.

[14:53] <masak> basically "divide and conquer" / "pit everyone against each other".

[14:54] <masak> anything else come to mind? :)

[14:54] <moritz> I also wonder if there should be a bonus/malus for accepted/rejected patches

[14:54] <masak> ooh. yes.

[14:54] * masak adds that

[14:54] <moritz> well, somebody could also add it as a patch :-)

[14:54] <moritz> that would have been my first patch, fwiw :-)

[14:54] <moritz> oh, and I'm in.

[14:54] *** wingfold joined
[14:55] <masak> hah. :)

[14:55] <masak> dang, now I have to build this ;)

[14:55] <masak> three players is kind of a minimum.

[14:56] * masak adds "Perl 6 Nomic" to his growing TODO list

[14:57] <masak> I think I could codify the *rules* as Perl 6 code in an evening or so.

[14:57] <masak> no more guesses for how to win? I know two more player types that I've seen in the wild.

[14:57] <moritz> well, there can be aliances

[14:57] <moritz> there can be harakiri

[14:58] <masak> yes, but I've yet to see a winning strategy emerge out of an alliance or a harakiri.

[14:58] <moritz> oh, and one more thing (not quite related to winning): there needs to be a deadline for patch proposal too

[14:58] <masak> I thought about that.

[14:59] <masak> decided not to add it, and to make it an exploitable problem in the game.

[14:59] <moritz> ok

[14:59] <masak> a two-player alliance could easily vote through anything at 23:50 on a Sunday.

[14:59] <moritz> that would make it kinda time consuming on Sunday nights

[15:00] <masak> heh. maybe make it mid-day some better day... :)

[15:02] <masak> anyway... the two remaining strategies I know of are: (1) gradually increase the complexity of the game, hoping to win by out-complexifying everyone else (let's call this strategy "the yudkowsky"), and (2) playing just for lulz, intentionally proposing/approving things that are more amusing than strategic, hoping to get people off-balance ("chaotic")

[15:03] <moritz> submit patches too late for anybody to vote on, for the not-voted penalty on them

[15:03] *** cognominal joined
[15:03] <masak> yep.

[15:03] <moritz> *force

[15:03] <masak> no, I won't fix that one.

[15:03] <moritz> masak++ "the yudkowsky"

[15:04] <moritz> well, there can always be patches that try to fix that.

[15:04] <moritz> also interesting questions: can submitted patches be refined?

[15:05] <moritz> (ie push more patches the same branch/pull request)

[15:05] *** dwoldrich joined
[15:05] <FROGGS_> I'd say yes, as long as there is no vote

[15:05] <masak> not in the initial ruleset.

[15:05] <masak> but I guess I should make it easy to add such logic.

[15:05] <cognominal>  masak, you game is more funnier if you patch the RNA code of a virus, use the Venter's "digital to biological converter" and inoculate the result to another player.  the winner is the last player alive http://edge.org/conversation/what-is-life

[15:07] <FROGGS_> hehe

[15:07] <FROGGS_> I'd be out

[15:07] <masak> the challenge in Nomic is making the game "take off", giving it a personality that makes people interested in the game's evolution.

[15:07] <cognominal> real world virus are slow to act because it is bad to kill the host before infecting others. In this game you want fast acting viruses

[15:14] <geekosaur> latest incarnation of core wars?

[15:14] *** cognominal joined
[15:15] <masak> geekosaur: Nomic and core wars definitely have commonalities. but I'd say Nomic is more loopy than core wars.

[15:15] <masak> anyone know what's going with Philippe's 'is export' problem on p6l?

[15:17] <geekosaur> aside from the typo?

[15:18] <geekosaur> (if there has been a followup, it hasn't reached me yet)

[15:18] <masak> oh, there was a typo?

[15:19] <geekosaur> SalesReportGram called, SalesExportGram exported

[15:19] <masak> yes, how about that.

[15:19] <masak> if no-one has replied that, I could do so.

[15:19] <geekosaur> I did already

[15:19] <masak> oki

[15:19] <masak> geekosaur++

[15:19] <geekosaur> maybe the list is slow

[15:19] <masak> yes. it is.

[15:54] <sahadev> hello #perl6. i have a question about implicit coercion (of Str to Int) in case of arithmetic operators. In case of most operators the coercion does take place, but div and mod seem to be exceptions. ("42" + "2" is ok, but "42" div "2" errors). why were these two operators designed as such? especially considering their symbolic counterparts (/ and %) seem to DWIM?

[15:55] <moritz> sahadev: Perl 6 has two types of operators. Most (like % and +) coerce their arguments

[15:55] <moritz> sahadev: and then there are a few operators that always take input of the same type, and produce output of the same time (div and mod, for example)

[15:55] <masak> r: 007

[15:55] <p6eval> rakudo b972ca: OUTPUT«Potential difficulties:␤    Leading 0 does not indicate octal in Perl 6; please use 0o07 if you mean that␤    at /tmp/fASOXE1sUd:1␤    ------> [32m007[33m⏏[31m<EOL>[0m␤    Leading 0 does not indicate octal in Perl 6; please use 0o07 if you mean that␤    at /tmp…

[15:55] <moritz> so, if that's not what you want, use / and % instead

[15:56] <masak> why do I get the warning twice? :)

[15:58] <sahadev> moritz: i have observed the same. i am curious about the reason why div and mod were designed to be non-coercive.

[15:59] <arnsholt> Whoa. My NQP compiled itself! =C

[15:59] <arnsholt> s/C/D

[15:59] <cognominal> arnsholt, what does you new NQP?

[15:59] * arnsholt makes test and sees what falls out

[16:00] <arnsholt> I'm working on making nqp::list be a sixmodel object, rather than a ResizablePMCArray

[16:00] <arnsholt> Bringing the Parrot side of things more in alignment with how things look on the JVM side, as it turns out. Although my reasons for working on it are not actually related to that

[16:01] <arnsholt> Lots of failed tests, though =)

[16:05] <masak> _sri++ posted, in the middle of yesterday's failed discussion on #parrot, http://nodejs.org/api/ -- a possible goal-post for Perl 6 to reach in terms of "production-ready" features. just thought I'd repost it here so it doesn't get lost in the noise.

[16:05] <tadzik> hello hello

[16:05] *** arlinius joined
[16:05] <hoelzro> masak++

[16:06] <hoelzro> I had an idea for the REPL yesterday

[16:06] <masak> also,

[16:06] <masak> <sri> speaking as an outsider... i get the impression rakudo development is too focused on polishing the core language, and doesn't pay enough attention to the stdlib

[16:06] <PerlJam> sahadev: whenever I notice things like that, I always wonder if there's some easy way to tell the difference a priori (without creating a test case).

[16:06] <hoelzro> masak: I echo that concern

[16:06] <hoelzro> however

[16:06] <hoelzro> that's not a problem if others (like myself) are willing and able to polish the stdlib

[16:07] <hoelzro> which is why I want to write a POSIX module

[16:07] <masak> oh, it's still a problem :)

[16:07] <masak> it's a thing which lots of people have to spend lots of time solving.

[16:07] <masak> and awareness of the specifics of the problem, and its magnitude, is a necessary first step.

[16:07] <PerlJam> masak: did you notice how many of the things in the nodejs api relate to IO?

[16:07] <hoelzro> s/not/not as much of/

[16:08] <perigrin> as PHP has shown you can simply make the stdlib part of the core language.

[16:08] * perigrin hides.

[16:08] <masak> PerlJam: and we're very weak on IO.

[16:08] <PerlJam> yep :(

[16:08] *** cognominal joined
[16:08] <masak> we got DateTime/Temporal settled. it works. it's a success.

[16:08] <masak> next up: IO.

[16:08] <masak> let's do this, people.

[16:09] <sahadev> PerlJam: that ("easy way to tell the difference") would be useful.

[16:10] <PerlJam> sahadev: yeah ... I don't have an answer in this partcular case because I don't think I ever noticed that quality of div/mod

[16:10] <hoelzro> I'm also working on IO::Socket::SSL

[16:10] <hoelzro> (which ties into my earlier question on IO::Socket and friends)

[16:11] <arnsholt> hoelzro++ # stdlib

[16:11] *** jeffreykegler joined
[16:11] <hoelzro> do we have a "Perl 6 production readiness" clock yet?

[16:11] <hoelzro> if so, I think we should start documenting what parts of the stdlib need work

[16:11] <hoelzro> ex. LWP::Simple is...nice, but far too rudimentary for real world usage

[16:12] <masak> my first thought is that a clock would be nice. my second thought is that it may do everyone a disservice to project production readiness down into one dimension.

[16:12] <hoelzro> ok

[16:12] <jeffreykegler> masak, moritz: I do not think it correct to call yesterday's #parrot exchange "failed".  You and allison stuck to technical issues, and stated them clearly.  

[16:12] <hoelzro> s/clock/checklist/ then =)

[16:13] <masak> maybe we'd be better off presenting a few orthogonal dimensions.

[16:13] <jeffreykegler> The result serves the reader well, though I imagine it was painful for participants

[16:13] <PerlJam> masak: as long as we have a clear definition from our perspective what "production readiness" means and can articulate that to others, I think it will still be a win.

[16:13] <perigrin> masak: two dimentions ... a clock is a vector no? 

[16:13] <masak> jeffreykegler: oh, it was failed. neither one got through to the other, and all that was created was blood pressure.

[16:13] <perigrin> people are expecting you to boil it down to one dimension already .... a boolean.

[16:13] <masak> jeffreykegler: I have more things to add to that discussion, but I'm consciously staying out of re-opening it.

[16:13] <PerlJam> perigrin++ indeed

[16:14] <masak> PerlJam: yeah, that's the goal.

[16:14] <hoelzro> masak: didn't you post a gist of "to dos" for production readiness?

[16:14] <masak> I was going to :/

[16:14] <masak> others did.

[16:14] <masak> it's in the backlog somewhere.

[17:17] <moritz> nr: my @a = <a b c>; @a.delete(2); say @a.elems

[17:17] <masak> r: my @a = 1..10; @a.pop; say @a

[17:17] <p6eval> rakudo b972ca, niecza v24-35-g5c06e28: OUTPUT«2␤»

[17:17] <p6eval> rakudo b972ca: OUTPUT«1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9␤»

[17:17] <moritz> ashleyde1: it seems that Perl 6 shrinks too, in imitation of perl 5.

[17:17] <moritz> sorry, meant arnsholt 

[17:18] <masak> it seems I misunderstood the question ;)

[17:44] <FROGGS> Is here somebody who would volunteer to add the test-fudge-mechanism to v5?

[17:45] <arnsholt> Oh. The NQP test suite reveals that delete should actually resize in any case!

[17:46] <FROGGS> arnsholt: well, if it really resize the allocated memory area is another story (if your questions was about that)

[17:47] *** cognominal left
[17:48] <PerlJam> Perl 5 doesn't resize the allocated memory when you shrink an array, so I don't think he was talking about that.

[17:51] <arnsholt> No, not the allocated area. After deleting at index 1 in an array with 4 elements, it expects the number of elements to be 3

[17:53] <pmichaud> back again

[17:54] *** cognominal joined
[17:55] <PerlJam> arnsholt: I don't think Perl 5 does any kind of optimization there either.

[17:56] <huf> arnsholt: delete how?

[17:56] <pmichaud> ...delete should resize? 

[17:56] <PerlJam> well ... what did you mean by "delete"?  

[17:56] <moritz> nr: my @a = <a b c>; @a.delete(2); say @a.elems

[17:56] <p6eval> rakudo b972ca, niecza v24-35-g5c06e28: OUTPUT«2␤»

[17:56] <pmichaud> I don't think delete resizes for elements removed from the middle.

[17:56] <moritz> only at the end

[17:56] <huf> and even that feels a bit bonusy to me :)

[17:57] <arnsholt> pmichaud: Then t/nqp/59-nqpop.t is wrong

[17:57] <huf> but then, delete on arrays feels bonusy to me :)

[17:57] <moritz> it feels like taking the Perl 5 semantics without thinking about it

[17:57] *** kaleem joined
[17:57] <arnsholt> This is in NQP mind, not real Perl 6

[17:57] <pmichaud> I mean in Perl 5.  Checking.

[17:57] <arnsholt> Oh, right. Sorry

[17:58] <arnsholt> Yeah, I'm pretty sure Perl 5 doesn't resize when you delete in the middle

[17:58] <moritz> p5eval: my @a = <a b c>; delete $a[1]; \@a

[17:58] <p5eval> moritz: ERROR: Can't locate File/Glob.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /lib) at (eval 7) line 1.BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 7) line 1.

[17:58] <moritz> p5eval: my @a = qw<a b c>; delete $a[1]; \@a

[17:58] <p5eval> moritz: ["a",undef,"c"]

[17:58] <arnsholt> You'd have to splice to do that

[17:58] <moritz> aye

[18:00] <PerlJam> I wonder why Perl 5 doesn't shrink the array from both ends since either way it's just a pointer move

[18:01] <pmichaud> I agree that the nqp test looks wrong to me.

[18:01] <huf> PerlJam: because shrinking from the end doesnt disturb the other elements

[18:01] <moritz> OTOH, on the NQP level, what would be the point of having a delete opteration that doesn't shrink?

[18:01] <pmichaud> Hope I'm not the one that wrote it.

[18:01] <arnsholt> Hehe

[18:01] <pmichaud> moritz: it can result in a shrink of it's the last element.

[18:02] <pmichaud> *if

[18:02] <arnsholt> To be fair, when that test was written, it expected the list to be backed by an RPA, which I assume has those semantics

[18:02] <moritz> after all you can implement Perl 6 level deletion (resetting) with simple element assignment

[18:03] <pmichaud> and jnthn and I were discussing that deletepos might not be needed (but that wasn't ever resolved)

[18:03] <pmichaud> oh, and nwc10, also.

[18:03] <arnsholt> Oh, I see. So that's why the JVM code doesn't have a delete_pos =)

[18:04] <pmichaud> okay, I'm not the one who wrote those tests.  phew.

[18:04] <pmichaud> now, the question is, why does it pass?

[18:05] <diakopter> elven magic

[18:05] <arnsholt> I'm assuming that's what RPA does

[18:05] <arnsholt> Gimme a sec, and I'll check the code

[18:05] *** daxim left
[18:06] <arnsholt> Yup. RPA's delete_keyed_int copies all the elements above the deleted element down a slot

[18:07] <arnsholt> And since nqp::list historically was just an RPA in disguise, the tests are like that

[18:07] *** dmol joined
[18:08] <pmichaud> yeah, apparently that's what RPA does.

[18:09] <PerlJam> do those semantics blead through to rakudo?  (I would guess so)

[18:10] <pmichaud> well, not really.

[18:10] <arnsholt> AFAICT, there's no code in NQP (apart from the tests) or Rakudo that uses deletepos

[18:10] <pmichaud> right.

[18:10] <pmichaud> and I'm not sure what QRPA does.

[18:10] <arnsholt> And nqp-jvm-prep has no mentions of deletepos anywhere that I can find

[18:11] <arnsholt> QRPA doesn't implement delete =)

[18:11] <pmichaud> anyway, deletepos, when/if it exists, will have the p5/p6 semantics and not the parrot ones.

[18:11] <arnsholt> Right, right

[18:26] <diakopter> er, 13

[18:27] <arnsholt> Last test file!

[18:27] <rurban> diakopter: no prob, just wanted to crosscheck :)

[18:28] <pmichaud> PerlJam: no, I'm not frustrated by it, because I've already explored the inconsistencies in allison's statements before.  :)

[18:30] <arnsholt> All green! \o/

[18:30] <arnsholt> Apart from the ones that are skipped. Best check those first

[18:30] <pmichaud> whenever I ask people "What is missing from Rakudo (Perl 6) to become 'production usable'?"  I get back the answers "speed, stabilility, libraries, and a transition path from p5".  We've definitely focused on the first two or three of these over the past 2.5 years.

[18:36] <masak> aye.

[18:37] <masak> I guess I'm a latecomer learning about allison's stance. :/

[18:39] <pmichaud> but yes, some of the comments on #parrot are really.... bizarre.

[18:42] <masak> tl;dr: "Perl 6 has no users" -- "yes, it does" -- "let's not argue semantics. Perl 6 doesn't ship" -- "yes, it does!" -- "you're arguing semantics again"

[18:43] <geekosaur> wat

[18:43] <diakopter> masak: I detect a certain amount of semantics in the fact that you're quoting. :)

[18:43] <geekosaur> "semantics" does not mean "doesn't agree with me"

[18:43] <sorear> good * #perl6

[18:43] <masak> sorear! \o/

[18:43] <sorear> pmichaud: what's up, down, and sideways today? o_O

[18:43] <masak> I guess the real conclusion to draw is that we should get that production-readiness page up, and soon.

[18:43] <pmichaud> the "Perl 6 has no users" and "Perl 6 doesn't ship" arguments come from        come from wanting to judge p6 by p5 standards of success.  That's not necessarily wrong, however there's also a tendency in those quotes to want to treat epsilon the same as zero.

[18:44] <moritz> geekosaur: after that exchange I left #parrot to cool down

[18:44] <[Coke]> I think a target goal of "MOAR USERS" is a good thing we can all agree on.

[18:44] <moritz> [Coke]: no doubt

[18:44] <pmichaud> [Coke]: I agree that "more users" is important.  But that has to be translated into smaller milestones.

[18:44] <masak> pmichaud: yes.

[18:44] <moritz> also "more possible use cases", which is nearly the same

[18:44] <masak> pmichaud: (to treating epsilon as zero)

[18:44] <moritz> which is where speed, modules, stability and IO come in again

[18:44] <pmichaud> and so far the smaller milestones I hear are "faster, more stable, more libraries"

[18:45] <diakopter> [Coke]: I think I can agree on "MOAR USERS"

[18:45] <masak> pmichaud: I see what allison is doing there, and the point she wants to make. I just keep holding her to higher standards than a rounding-down of epsilon.

[18:45] <hoelzro> (moar users)++

[18:45] <masak> (moar everything)++

[18:45] <pmichaud> masak: I suggest not doing that.  :)

[18:45] <masak> noted.

[18:45] <FROGGS> well, I am working on the "more libs" with v5

[18:45] <moritz> FROGGS++

[18:46] <pmichaud> to look at it from the other side, they're wanting to hold us to a higher standard than "we're making progress".

[18:46] * moritz currently writes an article for a German perl magazine

[18:46] <masak> pmichaud: yes, and I see that too.

[18:46] <masak> pmichaud: and I agree. I want to hold us to a higher standard than that, too.

[18:46] <FROGGS> jnthn does the speed thing (JVM), who does the more users?

[18:47] <moritz> FROGGS: it's not something you can tackle directly

[18:47] <pmichaud> FROGGS: there are marketing things that can be done to increase users, but until you solve some of the other basic hurdles any marketing efforts will tend to backfire

[18:47] <moritz> FROGGS: it's a mixture of providing the prerequisites, and of motivating people to try out Perl 6

[18:47] <FROGGS> moritz: well, I made two, and you at least one from what I know :o)

[18:48] <FROGGS> ya right, what was that quote again? "If you build it, they will come."

[18:48] *** Liz joined
[18:49] <sorear> i think the operant phrase here is "tough act to follow"

[18:49] <pmichaud> it's also to important to remember that for those of us working on Rakudo, we're not (yet?) at a stage where we feel our investments are likely to be lost.  Parrot has a bit more of an existential crisis than Perl 6 and Rakudo do.

[18:49] *** Liz is now known as Guest66032

[18:49] *** Guest66032 is now known as lizmat

[18:51] <masak> pmichaud: fair point.

[18:52] <masak> I bet when the Roman empire was crumbling, senators went around muttering "well, I really wish those Greek dudes would own up to their part of the problems, too"

[18:53] <pmichaud> :)

[18:55] <sorear> pmichaud: you've already thrown away everything twice, you're just more used to starting over with a better plan?

[18:56] <pmichaud> sorear: I think I'm out of the "starting over" phases, finally.  :)

[18:57] <pmichaud> that said, I'm absolutely convinced that the places where we did "start over" it was absolutely best to go ahead and "start over".  Maybe that cost us some users for the short-and-medium term, but long-term it was the right thing to do.  (more)

[18:57] <pmichaud> sticking with what we had before would've been a recipe for "you have to start lines with a TAB in Makefiles because we already have a userbase that expects it".

[18:59] <pmichaud> I think we have a reasonable story these days on speed improvements.  Where we fall short, story-wise, is something that demonstrates the "stability" (to end-users) of the language and implementations.

[18:59] *** GlitchMr- is now known as GlitchMr

[18:59] <pmichaud> being able to declare a 6.0.0 spec would probably help in that respect.

[19:00] <moritz> pmichaud: re stability story, I'm currently exploring doing the IRC logging through Perl 6

[19:00] <moritz> pmichaud: having a continuous production setting will force me to react to stability issues with my stuff more directly

[19:00] <pmichaud> agreed.

[19:12] <moritz> one of my favorites: Error messages!

[19:12] <hoelzro> *sigh*

[19:12] <hoelzro> I haven't read the transcript of the parrot talk

[19:12] <hoelzro> but now chromatic has referenced it on Twitter =/

[19:13] *** cognominal left
[19:13] <moritz> one of the things that have always bothered me is that most error messages don't give the user enough context

[19:13] <moritz> like they say "Cannot open ~/.somepipe: permission denied"

[19:14] <moritz> now the user wonders: why the </$!#@@!> did the program try to open that pipe?

[19:14] <moritz> I'd want to know "I tried to open that pipe, and failed with "permission denied". I tried that because I want to talk to DCOP to get some configuration data from gnome" or something along these lines

[19:15] <moritz> of course that's way too much text to burden the lazy programmer with

[19:15] *** cognominal joined
[19:15] <hoelzro> how does the "default" EXPORT for a UNIT work?

[19:15] <moritz> now if a programmer gets the same error, he reads the backtrace, and can roughly deduce what happens (if he happens to know the program)

[19:16] *** SamuraiJack__ left
[19:16] <hoelzro> how does the module inject definitions into the calling context?

[19:16] <moritz> (phone, bbiab)

[19:17] <arnsholt> moritz: I think I agree. Compiler/runtime diagnostics should be as helpful as possible

[19:17] <pmichaud> (just read chromatic's tweets).... it would be far more helpful if chromatic and allison could point out the specific "unstable" features, rather than simply carping about them generically.

[19:17] <arnsholt> I'm quite used to deciphering cryptic diagnostics from GCC (and don't get me started about TeX/LaTeX), but not having retarded diagnostics is definitely a plus IMO

[19:18] <moritz> so, maybe we should give our routines :dba adverbs

[19:18] <lizmat> :dba ?

[19:18] <moritz> which could appear in user-readable backtraces

[19:19] <hoelzro> moritz: that's a neat idea

[19:19] <moritz> lizmat: "do business as", a feature we have in the regex engine

[19:19] * lizmat knows about database administrators, but wonders how they would become an adverb

[19:19] <lizmat> aha

[19:19] <lizmat> ok

[19:19] *** Gruu_ left
[19:19] * lizmat has a backlog of catching up on synopses :-(

[19:20] <arnsholt> moritz: That's actually a very neat idea. I like it!

[19:21] <moritz> (me previous idea was to use contextuals, like  my $*BUSINESS = 'reading config file')

[19:21] <moritz> (I think I like :dba better)

[19:21] <pmichaud> gone again

[19:25] *** cognominal left
[19:26] <lizmat> $*DOING ?

[19:27] <moritz> (back from phone)

[19:27] <lizmat> dba seems too much like a job description to me

[19:27] <moritz> so, the idea is to have an end user's view on backtraces, which only considers routines marked in some way as being of interest to the user

[19:28] <moritz> lizmat: naming is up for discussion, as always :-)

[19:28] <lizmat> but that could well be my mind needs reprogramming in that respect

[19:28] <moritz> but first I want to get more general feedback on the idea

[19:28] <lizmat> I like the idea

[19:28] <lizmat> to an extent, this could replace at least partly internal documentation

[19:28] <moritz> so, that's 2 +1s

[19:29] <lizmat> I don't think my plusses count as 1 yet

[19:29] <lizmat> more like 0.01  :-)

[19:30] <moritz> good that we round up to the next integer :-)

[19:30] <timotimo_> i wonder if perl6 parsing could be made faster by either estimating the right path better to backtrack less often or make it cheaper to throw away data that was generated as side-effects of parsing

[19:30] <hoelzro> so this "general dba" extension isn't just for compiler authors, right? you could do it in regular code?

[19:31] <moritz> hoelzro: sure

[19:31] <hoelzro> so what would that look like?

[19:31] <moritz> something like   sub write-config($config, $file) dba('Safing user config file') { # code here }

[19:31] <moritz> *saving

[19:31] <timotimo_> i like the idea fwiw

[19:31] <moritz> and then if that sub dies, the backtrace would read

[19:32] <sorear> .oO( not my $*BUSINESS )

[19:32] <moritz> "Error while opening file $file for writing: permission deninend\nWhile saving user config file")

[19:32] <hoelzro> ok, neat

[19:36] <timotimo_> multiple DBA's would probably be more like a stack actually

[19:39] * lizmat wonders whether :dba shouldn't be in nqp

[19:40] <arnsholt> Which repository does dalek live in?

[19:40] <arnsholt> :dba is probably best suited to be implemented in Perl 6

[19:41] <arnsholt> Or, the Perl 6 compiler

[19:41] <moritz> arnsholt: iirc there's a "botnix-plugins" repo somewhere

[19:41] <lizmat> I was wondering whether :dba  could be helpful in debugging NQP problems

[19:41] <timotimo_> moritz: can you just define a sub trait_mod:<dba> and it'll work like that or how is that done without relying on "is"?

[19:42] <diakopter> dalek could easily be reimplemented in something else, since sorear++ simplified it so all it does is send lines from a file to channels

[19:43] <moritz> timotimo_: iirc rakudo doesn't do user-defined trait_mod's yet

[19:43] <moritz> timotimo_: so I have to hijack 'is' or 'does' or 'handles' or whatever

[19:43] * skids wonders at the etymology of dba (aside from the acronym meaning)

[19:43] <hoelzro> $/ is lexical, right?

[19:43] <skids> Does it hail from an old language?

[19:43] <arnsholt> https://github.com/Infinoid/dalek-plugins perhaps?

[19:44] <hoelzro> I can't address function a's $/ from b if a calls b?

[19:44] <arnsholt> $/ is lexical, yeah

[19:44] <hoelzro> hmm

[19:44] <arnsholt> So if you want to use it from something your function calls, pass it as an argument

[19:45] * hoelzro is still trying to figure out how the heck to create his own EXPORT

[19:45] <arnsholt> Or put it in a dynamically scoped var, I guess

[19:47] <timotimo_> hoelzro: there's a branch that makes (is supposed to make) EXPORT able to return a hash of symbols that will be installed

[19:48] *** FROGGS joined
[19:48] <hoelzro> oh

[19:48] <timotimo_> last time i checked, it only works well for types (or was that subs?)

[19:48] <hoelzro> that's handy

[19:48] <moritz> timotimo_: only for subs

[19:48] <moritz> and I'm supposed to work on it

[19:48] <hoelzro> is it possible to do in mainline rakudo?

[19:48] <timotimo_> :)

[19:48] <moritz> instead I prototype dba for routines

[19:49] * moritz must resist putting the hacking into the article he's writing just now

[19:49] <timotimo_> as long as you get both to work for the next rakudo compiler release ... ;)

[19:49] *** japhb_ joined
[19:49] <timotimo_> at least I don't mind

[19:50] <hoelzro> I prefer the return hash

[19:50] <hoelzro> but I want this damn POSIX module to start working!

[19:50] <moritz> hoelzro: the problem with the CALLER appraoch is that the lexical scope you're in isn't strictly the caller of EXPORT

[19:50] <hoelzro> ah, good point

[19:51] <moritz> it's called from within the compiler for that scope

[19:51] *** myname_ joined
[19:51] <hoelzro> so my current EXPORT looks like this: sub EXPORT(*@imports) { for @imports -> $import { say "importing $import"; } }

[19:51] <hoelzro> and the printing never happens

[19:51] <hoelzro> I'm guessing that for does some sort of lazy magic?

[19:51] <hoelzro> or...?

[19:51] <moritz> needs to be our sub EXPORT

[19:51] <moritz> and yes, add a 1; or so after it, just to be sure

[19:52] <hoelzro> our sub EXPORT fails

[19:52] <moritz> how?

[19:52] <hoelzro> moritz: is that the reason, though? laziness?

[19:52] <hoelzro> Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol &EXPORT

[19:52] * moritz confused

[19:52] * hoelzro too

[19:52] <moritz> oh

[19:52] <moritz> are you using 'lib' ?

[19:53] <hoelzro> CALLER::<CALLER><fork> = &fork

[19:53] <hoelzro> ?

[19:53] <moritz> eg use lib 'some path';?

[19:53] <hoelzro> from the importing script, yes

[19:53] <moritz> ah

[19:53] <moritz> we need a better solution for EXPORT

[19:53] <hoelzro> agreed =/

[19:53] <hoelzro> this is actually pretty painful

[19:53] <moritz> I'd like to discuss this with jnthn++ soon

[19:55] <moritz> r: module A { method x() { } }; A.x

[19:55] <p6eval> rakudo b972ca: OUTPUT«Useless declaration of a has-scoped method in module␤No such method 'x' for invocant of type 'A'␤  in block  at /tmp/BqgbWp_mFD:1␤␤»

[19:55] <moritz> that's why we can't make EXPORT a method

[19:55] <FROGGS> timotimo_: GPN sounds nice

[19:56] <timotimo_> it's an excellent event, indeed

[19:56] <pmichaud> I was going to attempt some troll hugging with chromatic++... but after seeing his latest tweets I'm not sure it's worth the effort.  He's still complaining about the state of things as of two years ago.  :-/

[19:57] <timotimo_> hoelzro: since you're the pygmens-perl6 guru; have you ever looked at CodeMirror? do you have an idea how that works? i believe it's the piece of ipython notebook that does the syntax highlighting and it probably lacks a perl6 highlighter (not asking you to do it, though. not just yet ;) )

[19:57] <pmichaud> anyway, we need to come up with some publishable measure of stability.

[19:57] * hoelzro has never heard of CodeMirror =(

[19:57] <timotimo_> no problem then

[19:57] <hoelzro> heh

[19:57] * diakopter heads to twitter

[19:57] <timotimo_> (it's a javascript based code editor used in many, many places)

[19:57] <pmichaud> also, I'm struck that "small stable core" and "get p5 folks to switch to p6" are mutually incompatible somehow.

[19:57] <[Coke]> pmichaud: I think we have to focus our limited tuits on things we think will have an effect, yes.

[19:58] <hoelzro> timotimo_: pygments was step 1

[19:58] <timotimo_> oh, i know this meme! step 4 is profit, right? :D

[19:58] <hoelzro> step 2 is vim-perl

[19:58] *** cognominal left
[19:59] <pmichaud> I'm also curious about:   16:21 <kid51> The weird thing about the above discussion is: Parrot has fewer users than Perl 6, but we're not in denial about it.

[19:59] <pmichaud> my first focus was the "not in denial about it" part... but after thinking about it a bit more, it strikes me that Parrot has to have at least as many users as Rakudo does.  :)

[19:59] <diakopter> you mean a user of rakudo is a user of parrot..? he means project users

[19:59] <diakopter> [I think]

[20:00] <pmichaud> diakopter: if so, I think there's an implication that he somehow expected Parrot to have more users than just Perl 6, which wouldn't make sense.

[20:00] <pmichaud> not that any of this makes sense.

[20:00] <moritz> .oO( we've tried it with sense. It was frustrating. )

[20:01] <hoelzro> so...there's no way of injecting things from EXPORT into the calling context yet?

[20:01] <hoelzro> if so, I'll have to just grin and bear it

[20:01] <pmichaud> kid51 also repeatedly points to Moose, Catalyst, Dancer, etc. as being examples of p5 evolution within a "stable product", but doesn't recognize that those also were outgrowths of Perl 6.

[20:01] <hoelzro> but I really want to write this POSIX module =)

[20:01] <nwc10> Catalyst was?

[20:02] <pmichaud> well, perhaps not Catalyst.

[20:02] <pmichaud> Although I'm sure there are some p6 influencers there.

[20:02] *** census joined
[20:02] <pmichaud> my point being simply that p5 evolution hasn't taken place divorced from p6

[20:04] <hoelzro> timotimo_: where else is CodeMirror used?

[20:05] <anocelot> FWIW, TimToady mentioned that the p6 movement added a lot of energy to the p5 work as well.

[20:08] <lizmat> even though the PONIE project was stopped, it also still caused a lot of cleanup in the Jenga that the internals of Perl 5 are

[20:08] <lizmat> so Perl 5 also benefitted a lot from that

[20:09] *** cognominal joined
[20:10] <nwc10> not a *lot*, in absolute terms. But it revealed something specific and useful - that pretty much none of the XS code on CPAN cared about the exact binary layout of the data structures, as long as the macros kept working

[20:17] <hoelzro> $*W is Rakudo-specific, right?

[21:51] <diakopter> anocelot: apparently someone likes to color your nick bold red

[21:51] <anocelot> tablet 3 toward the end is a link labeled 'go to the twigil chapter..' that doesn't include the "tablet-3-" prefix for variables.html

[21:51] <lichtkind> thanks a lot

[21:52] <anocelot> diakopter: Oh, right. What is my github name...?  Hang on a sec.

[21:52] <masak> lue: not so much syntax needed. we have regexes and grammars.

[21:52] <masak> lue: but we *do*, as sorear pointed out, need a way to hook actions into a slang, not just a grammar.

[21:53] <lue> yeah. Probably just need to clarify the actions side of it.

[21:53] <masak> that would be a great start.

[21:55] <diakopter> anocelot: see privmsg

[21:56] <lizmat> masak: in your proposal for Nomic, why: $player.votes_made($player.votes_made() + 1); instead of $player.votes_made++ or $player.votes_made += 1; ?

[21:56] <masak> lizmat: excellent question! I was waiting for that one.

[21:56] <lizmat> sorry to have kept you waiting

[21:56] <masak> :)

[21:57] <masak> lizmat: because the way everything can hook into the changing of values is to have everything in the system be "observables", subscribable getter-setters.

[21:57] <masak> lizmat: the two alternatives you suggest wouldn't trigger the proper reactions in listeners.

[21:57] <masak> in other words, it's the syntactic/API price one pays for having observables.

[21:58] <lizmat> feels like a source for WTF in the future to me

[21:58] <masak> now, having said that, I *guess* everything can be done through Proxy and FETCH/STORE...

[21:58] * geekosaur would comment such thing

[21:58] <masak> and that would definitely look nicer.

[21:59] <masak> lizmat: you're right. I'll change it to be easier.

[22:05] <anocelot> lichtkind: Do you mind if I fix this one?

[22:06] <masak> lue: even besides the fact that we like keeping grammars and actions as different containers, a token is just a method, so you have a namespace conflict on hand.

[22:06] <lichtkind> i fix all :)

[22:07] <masak> lue: examples of modifying the grammar with slangs: derive the main Perl 6 slang. override the method 'identifier' to accept smiley symbols in it. set the main slang to the new derived class.

[22:16] <masak> lue: I thought you meant to do something like 'augment method new { ... }'

[22:16] <masak> lue: now that I understand your question: yes, 'augment' on a class would replace old methods in the class.

[22:17] <masak> lue: no, I meant using subclassing, not augmentation.

[22:17] <masak> lue: overwriting the existing grammar considered antisocial.

[22:17] <masak> lue: because we want the slang to be lexically scoped.

[22:19] <lue> But, that's the only way slangs are used in the spec: http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Slangs (specifically the " by lexically scoped declaration of a new sublanguage:" line before the augment slang example)

[22:21] <lichtkind> its all fine

[22:21] <FROGGS> [Coke]: ping

[22:23] <lichtkind> anocelot: as you see in https://github.com/perl6/tablets/commit/317fa2dae92ef7f0933437fc7c3479bc616ce4fa you dont need full url to link to same page

[22:24] <masak> lue: if you crack that nut, you will have left an indelible mark on the evolution of Perl 6. :)

[22:24] <lue> I almost want to say slang is a shortcut for grammar [Appropriate Grammar's Name], but then what would the shortcut for actions be?

[22:24] <timotimo_> swagger

[22:24] <anocelot> lichtkind: When I clicked the link on the tablets.perl5.org I got a 404 error, so I assumed it needed the full URL.

[22:25] <masak> lue: well, you'd tend to want to define them together.

[22:25] <timotimo_> "actions" may not be longer than "swagger", but it amuses me to suggest it, and it's not totally wrong

[22:25] <anocelot> lichtkind: For the .dm file it's OK?  Sorry; I'm probably not as familiar with Git as I should be.

[22:25] <lichtkind> i dont  know which link it was and i have to leave soon

[22:25] <masak> lue: and just as the grammar (in the 'augment' case) is a subclass of a grammar, you'd want the actions class to be a subclass of an existing actions class.

[22:26] <timotimo_> a random question: "augment class" is a lexical or global change?

[22:26] <lichtkind> there are no .dm files to edit as far as i know

[22:26] <masak> timotimo_: global.

[22:26] <masak> timotimo_: because classes are global.

[22:28] <lue> I feel the actions side of slangs would be easier if we had a separate actions construct

[22:28] <timotimo_> masak: the 'lexical equivalent' of "augment class" is just deriving from it, aye?

[22:29] <lue> timotimo_: except currently augmenting a class changes it everywhere until the End of Time™.

[22:29] <lue> while augment slang is using a special definition of "augment".

[22:30] <masak> timotimo_: yes, if (1) you make it a 'my class', and (2) you give it the same name, so that it lexically shadows the outer one.

[22:30] <lue> .oO(can action methods accept anything other than $/ as a parameter?)

[22:54] <lue> Some initial slang action ideas: https://gist.github.com/lue/5241230

[22:56] <masak> lue: well, you've put your finger on something interesting here.

[22:57] <masak> lue: 'augment slang' means lexiaclly replace some grammar in the current scope. (or dynamically replace, from the perspective of the parser.)

[22:57] <masak> but 'augment class', which one would use for an actions class, would have a global, irreversible effect.

[22:58] <lue> I wonder if augment grammar is closer to class or to slang...

[22:58] <masak> on the one hand, it does kinda feel like double the work to have to augment two things just to build a new slang. on the other hand, a slang feels like just the grammar, not grammar+actions.

[22:58] <masak> so there's kind of a tension there.

[22:58] <lue> Like I said earlier, I'd like to know what the original author (likely TimToady) thought a slang was.

[23:00] <timotimo_> is it even possible to sensibly expand only the grammar, but keep "api compatibility" to the previous grammar's actions?

[23:00] *** Khisanth joined
[23:00] <lue> .oO(maybe slang should contain a special type of method that takes two curly braces: slang MAIN { feature token-or-something {regex}{actions};}; )

[23:01] <timotimo_> oh yikes, that seems  weeeeeeiird

[23:02] <cognominal> is it possible to hide a rule in a slang or change an operator precedence?

[23:02] <masak> timotimo_: re api compatibility, that's a really good question too. essentially we're into the usual problems with classes and inheritance.

[23:02] <cognominal> that's really two independent questions

[23:02] <lue> timotimo_: changing Perl 6 from within is weeeeeeiird too :)

[23:03] <timotimo_> not as weird as introducing such a strange concept as two curly blocks following with nothing in between

[23:03] <cognominal> bed time. Will read the log.

[23:52] <timotimo_> lue: my 0.2 cents is that it's nicer to have a keyword before each of the braces. it's like the difference between positional args and keyword args. the latter seems more readable to me.

[23:53] <timotimo_> also, consider that the }{ may be separated by lots and lots of lines from the beginning and end of the whole construct

[23:53] <lue> yeah. I was thinking of maybe a different brace for the second set.

[23:54] <lue> timotimo_: I just typed }{ because I prefer it. Of course a bunch of newlines inbetween the } and { is fine

[23:54] <timotimo_> i dunno. it may feel disconnected and look like a loose block if there's two newlines for example

[23:55] <lue> different brace style might be the way to go, with some enforced connectedness perhaps (feature newtoken /grammar/{actions} or feature newtoken {grammar}«actions» or ...)
