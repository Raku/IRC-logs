[00:12] <japhb> Ah, well -- perl6-bench can extract and build various versions of Rakudo, benchmark them, and compare them.  But it does not yet have comprehensive tests to really check all angles.  There are some tests that are runnable on current Rakudo that are so incredibly space or time wasting that they cannot be reasonably run on older ones -- those usually tell quite the tale.

[00:13] <japhb> lichtkind, otherwise I'd say look in the git commit logs for promising commits, and talk to pmichaud or jnthn for things they remember.  But if you do so -- write it all down so that in the future when people ask, we can just point them somewhere

[00:14] <japhb> Oh, and pmichaud did an interesting presentation on big improvements to startup time and such.

[00:15] <lichtkind> where :)

[00:15] <lichtkind> thanks y lot

[00:17] <lichtkind> actually im writing an article :)

[02:45] <darkf> can roles imply other roles? (e.g. if I have a role Foo that when included with `does` will also ensure role Bar is included)

[02:55] <darkf> lichtkind: how would I do that? just `$self does ...` in the role or another way?

[02:58] *** liudelong_______ left
[02:58] *** liudelong_______ joined
[02:59] <lichtkind> darkf: both ways with does in role or with also does compile time

[02:59] <lichtkind> i mean both is compile time

[03:01] <darkf> lichtkind: alright, cool - how would I access members from other roles inside another role? I get "Attribute $!x not declared in role Foo" because it's defined in Bar, even when doing `role Foo does Bar`, etc.

[03:02] *** liudelong_______ left
[03:03] <japhb> darkf, private attributes really are private to the class/role they are defined in.

[03:03] <japhb> This is What You Want, even though many languages seem to not get this right.

[03:03] *** liudelong_______ joined
[03:04] <japhb> darkf, perhaps you want to declare and refer to public attributes instead?

[03:05] <darkf> japhb: yep - they should be public data

[03:06] <skids> S14 states that private attributes are not private from the viewpoint of role composition.

[03:09] <darkf> well, to be clear, I am trying to do this: http://pastebin.com/TDwxnscE I just don't understand how to access Foo's x member I suppose

[03:09] <japhb> r: role Bar { has $.a; }; role Foo does Bar { has $.b; method set_a($new) { $!a = $new };  }; class Baz does Foo { }; my Baz $baz .= new(a => 1, b => 2); say $baz.a; $baz.set_a(4); say $baz.a

[03:09] <skids> Yes I think that is to spec, just not yet implemented.

[03:10] <darkf> ah

[03:10] <skids> I've had to use public attributes where I really want privates.

[03:11] <skids> Though I'm unclear as to whether it is legal via the "$e does Bar"

[03:12] <skids> but with just a class E does Bar I think it is specced to work.

[03:17] <skids> It seems to work with public attributes, yes.  (just changed $!x etc to e.g. $.x and actually assigned a value to .x)

[11:02] *** liudelong_______ left
[11:02] <masak> and the point isn't really about "what Perl ought to be", the point is really about "should we emphasize 6 > 5" and "do we call it 'next version' or 'next major release'?"

[11:02] * sjn vaguely remembers that the "Perl family" thing was discussed at the reunification summit in Perl. Anyone here that was there?

[11:02] * masak 

[11:02] <masak> and "Perl family" really started with the two "bridge" blog posts.

[11:02] <masak> time to link them, I guess, to provide background. hold on.

[11:03] <masak> http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/how-perl-6-could-kill-us-all

[11:03] <masak> http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/f_ck-perl-6/

[11:03] <masak> now, I know you will see mst's title and go "wot's he mean?"

[11:04] <masak> but mst is actively *helping* Perl 6 here, in a very roundabout way which speaks to active p5ers.

[11:05] <masak> ...to the point where he has shaped the discourse to be able to say something like "Perl 5 is about creating the best possible today, while Perl 6 is about creating all the best possible tomorrows" on the last YAPC::EU.

[11:05] <masak> it's not something that could have been believed by p5ers 4 years ago, according to mst.

[11:06] <cognominal> I hope that someday we will embed rakudo into chrome, creating an environment that I would call camelia. And there would no point of comparing camellia to perl 5 being entities of different nature. But I am day dreaming.

[11:06] <masak> see also http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/the-wish-the-tuning-fork-and-the-one-true-heir

[11:07] <masak> and http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/perl-6-and-perl-5-are-different-languages

[11:23] <cognominal> ewith that semantic of  allowing modifying composite arguments, we have little chance to avoid the successive folding and unfolding as an optimisation.  like in trying to inline &b into &a :  sub a (*@a) { b |@a }

[12:51] *** SamuraiJack left
[12:51] <[Coke]> pmichaud: I just caught up with backscroll and agree with you. I think the change he made is in line with what we've been saying collectively.

[12:51] <cognominal> There is a positional_delegate role in nqp and not in rakudo. What is the rational?

[12:53] <pmichaud> cognominal: note that nqp and rakudo are not always precisely synced.

[12:53] *** SamuraiJack joined
[12:53] <pmichaud> especially now, with nqp getting lots of changes to support multi-vm strategies.

[12:54] <pmichaud> so there may be a reason for them being different, but that reason could also be "because we haven't updated rakudo to match yet"

[12:55] <cognominal> pmichaud: in this occurrence, I should understand it is the later reason?

[12:56] <pmichaud> cognominal: I don't know... probably jnthn++ would have to say for sure.

[12:56] <cognominal> it is a nice feature btw

[12:57] <pmichaud> maybe see when positional_delegate was added.

[12:57] <pmichaud> if it's recent, then that argues for "rakudo hasn't caught up yet"

[12:57] *** census joined
[13:00] <gtodd> "postcircumfix:<{ }> not defined for type Str"  ... comes from a block where I add parsed thingies to an array .. which I thought I remembered working.  Is this wrong:

[13:02] <cognominal> pmichaud: they have been added in February

[13:02] <moritz> gtodd: old-ish rakudo had a bug that you could hash-index a string

[13:03] <pmichaud> cognominal: then yes, I think it's added for multi-vm capabilities and rakudo just isn't using it yet in the nom branch.

[13:03] * pmichaud utterly fails at posting a comment to 39a9115

[13:03] <gtodd> moritz: wow! :-)  

[13:04] <gtodd> moritz: thank you for making me feel less insane :)

[13:04] <timotimo> moritz: how did that behave? that seems weird

[13:04] <moritz> timotimo: it was weird

[13:05] <timotimo> how hard would it be to set up a system where one can evaluate an expression on hundreds of rakudo versions?

[13:05] <pmichaud> timotimo: I suspect we first need hundreds of rakudo versions.  :)

[13:05] <timotimo> automatically. and have sensible output about where the differences happen

[13:05] *** census left
[13:05] <timotimo> generalise hundreds to N ;)

[13:06] <timotimo> maybe even git coul handle the "backend" parts. it should be enough to track a few folders and checkout the versions one after another

[13:07] <gtodd> timotimo: that would be amazin

[13:07] <timotimo> are there some environment variables that change where things are put?

[13:07] <timotimo> like ~/.perl6? where does that come from?

[13:07] <timotimo> oh, apparently that doesn't exist any more on my system, must be a fossil

[13:10] <masak> timotimo: it's an intriguing idea. a bit like 'git bisect', but with lots of Rakudo revisions pre-built in different directories.

[13:11] <masak> timotimo: and one could still do a 'git bisect'-like algorithm on those directories, zooming in on the differences quickly.

[13:11] <pmichaud> I essentially do that locally -- I have a directory that keeps compiled versions of all rakudo releases.

[13:11] <spider-mario> LibreOffice does that, does it not?

[13:11] <spider-mario> I think I‚Äôve read that recently

[13:11] <timotimo> masak: sounds like a fun project to me.

[13:11] <timotimo> getting all the rakudo stars would probably give a decent sampling of the rakudo progress

[13:11] <pmichaud> I don't have a system to submit a piece of code to them all simultaneously, though -- haven't needed that.

[13:11] <spider-mario> they seem to do that, indeed

[13:11] <spider-mario> they call it bibisect

[14:28] <spider-mario> tup tracks which files are hand-written and which files are automatically generated (and by which rule)

[14:29] <isBEKaml> masak: I got the same word/though as diakopter when I saw #masakism. :P

[14:29] <isBEKaml> *thought

[14:29] <spider-mario> dependencies on generated files must be explicitly stated, and tup watches the commands it runs to infer dependencies on hand-written files

[14:30] *** gfldex joined
[14:30] <spider-mario> it also checks that commands do not create more files than declared in the Tupfile

[14:30] <masak> (Useless use of "," in expression)++

[14:30] <spider-mario> thus, a correct Tupfile is supposedly parallel-safe

[14:30] <masak> I swear, it's almost as if Perl 6 gets better and more user-friendly over time.

[14:30] <masak> or Rakudo, to be exact.

[14:31] <spider-mario> and I love that it can watch a directory and update everything when something changes. :)

[14:31] <spider-mario> or remove obsolete targets when their rules are removed. \o/

[14:31] <masak> isBEKaml: I'd be lying if I said that was completely unintentional. :)

[14:34] <isBEKaml> "Useless use of void in IRC context"

[14:39] * masak .oO( being a scarecrow is being out standing in one's field )

[14:39] <isBEKaml> masak: that was stupid drama over some private conversation - I can't help but think that perl folks would have reacted differently to this, given the same set of circumstances. 

[14:39] <moritz> isBEKaml: it's not "$language folks" as much as one particular person that attended the conference

[14:40] <moritz> isBEKaml: and that one outlier can happen in the Perl community as well

[14:40] <isBEKaml> moritz: I know - that one person commanded so much following that people were blindly taken in. :(

[14:40] <masak> isBEKaml: the part of that drama that overshadowed everything else -- or should have -- is the thing that happened last: the violence/death threats to the feminist who posted the picture.

[14:41] <masak> isBEKaml: not only does that bit prove without a doubt that we collectively have a problem -- it's much worse than all of the other petty things in that chain of events, combined.

[14:41] * FROGGS is totally free of problems O.o

[14:41] <cxreg> is rakudo meant to be "make -j"-safe?

[14:41] <cxreg> it totally broke

[14:41] <isBEKaml> masak: I don't want to label people as feminist or otherwise - but people were so much brash and violent without pausing to think about aftereffects of their actions. :(

[14:42] <FROGGS> cxreg: make -j4 is working stable for my box, but dont use multiple jobs for make install

[14:42] <isBEKaml> cxreg: I don't think so - though I use make -j2 occasionally (building the setting is a blocking operation)

[14:42] <moritz> masak: I actually didn't even know about those threats, because I started actively ignoring everything related to that incident

[14:42] <cxreg> i got a "load_bytecode" couldn't find file 'Perl6/Ops.pbc'

[14:51] <spider-mario> well, I was at the time it happened

[14:51] <spider-mario> or maybe even saturday

[14:51] <FROGGS> spider-mario: I am thinking that this might be faulty: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e9e1b5d9625d400453b922aca36417e96c040945

[14:51] <spider-mario> This is nqp version 2013.04-54-gbfb3669 built on parrot 5.3.0 revision RELEASE_5_3_0-21-g438b1c4

[14:51] <PerlJam> masak: as long as no perl conference suffers such idiocy, we're doing good :)

[14:52] <cxreg> i have rakudo 0d1d1194a4

[14:52] <spider-mario> FROGGS : -j2 broke nqp as well, actually

[14:52] <spider-mario> is that supposed to happen?

[14:52] <FROGGS> no

[14:52] *** xilo left
[14:52] <FROGGS> but this can be due to jnthn's sourc file renaming...

[14:52] <FROGGS> this will work again pretty soon

[14:53] <masak> PerlJam: not sure what you mean. YAPC::NA has a Code of Conduct. the Perl community is not immune to either sexism idiocy or overreaction idiocy or threat idiocy.

[14:54] <masak> PerlJam: I personally believe we're *better* at handling all of those... but we're not immune.

[14:54] <moritz> and we also have quite a bit of friction in the Perl community

[14:54] <PerlJam> sure.   This is just one area where I hope most Perl people are close to the "average"

[14:55] <PerlJam> Perl doesn't need any more bad press.

[14:55] <cxreg> so with nqp-jvm-prep being merged, is the jvm build going to be part of an upcoming R* release?

[14:56] <masak> PerlJam: from what I can tell, incidents definitely happen. but organizers of Perl confs are expert *defusers*, handling things smoothly behind the scenes and out of the blogosphere.

[14:56] <moritz> fwiw a rakudo build with -j4 worked for me

[14:56] <moritz> cxreg: the upcoming R* release will contain rakudo 2013.04, which doesn't have that support

[14:56] <moritz> cxreg: and afaict the support only stretches to building with an NQP that can also build on the JVM

[14:57] <moritz> cxreg: but I don't think rakudo can build on an NQP that was actually with the JVM, and not parrot

[14:57] <nwc10> cxreg: "yes", but that isn't the answer to the question that you thought you asked :-)

[14:57] <cxreg> fair enough

[14:57] <isBEKaml> moritz: OOC, why can't we see rakudo on nqp-jvm? Does it have any parrot-y bits ?

[14:58] <cxreg> i didnt mean _the_ upcoming R*, just one of the next ... 6 or so

[14:58] <nwc10> aha, then it is the answer to the question you meant :-)

[14:58] <isBEKaml> moritz: I thought they were restricted to nqp?

[14:58] <moritz> isBEKaml: there are still parrot-y bits in rakudo; the abstraction that nqp offered wasn't perfect

[14:58] <cxreg> blasphemy!

[14:58] <isBEKaml> moritz: Ah, I see. 

[14:59] <cxreg> a port is a great way to see where those parts lie

[15:43] <isBEKaml> gfldex: old dlls?

[15:43] <gfldex> under rakudo/ and parrot/ 

[15:44] <isBEKaml> gfldex: Oh, I usually do git clean -xdf. That should wipe everything not under git revision. 

[15:44] <gfldex> that should do

[15:44] <gfldex> windows is not very good at removing dlls from memory, hence the need for reboots

[15:46] <isBEKaml> here's another bit - I didn't launch any parrot/p6 process. git pull, perl Configure, make -j #BOOM

[16:06] <PerlJam> sympathy or empathy?

[16:10] <PerlJam> I tend to ignore the markers as "garbage" and then figure out the meaning from context.   If I just recognized the "lols" as contextual cues I'd have less figuring-out to do.

[17:47] <timotimo> masak: when indexing with a failure, a new failure is created?

[17:47] <masak> no, when using a failure in any way, it closes the trap and turns into an exception.

[17:48] <masak> so the end result would be the same, but with possibly a better error message.

[18:01] <masak> PerlJam: I *implemented* .end, before I know properly what it did. and I implemented it as "gimme the last element".

[18:01] <masak> PerlJam: had to go back and re-do it. :)

[18:02] <masak> PerlJam: I think .end is there simply because we don't have $#array any more, and we "needed" some syntax to cover up for it.

[18:03] <PerlJam> It's also weird that it's the only method that talks about a specific index.  Why not also .mid so that we can better binarily search too? 

[18:03] <PerlJam> (okay, that's just crazy, but so is .end :)

[18:03] <masak> and .beg so we can abstrac away from 0 :P

[18:04] <masak> abstract*

[18:04] <masak> yes, I could easily axe .end and I think some code would break, but overall not many would care.

[18:21] <pmichaud> .mid is   */2  :-P

[18:21] <PerlJam> then .beg should clearly be *-*

[18:22] <timotimo> more like $^a - $^a

[18:22] *** baest joined
[18:23] <timotimo> but that kind of simplifies to **0 immediately

[18:23] <timotimo> or is there actually a two-argument form of the indexing fucntion?

[18:23] * colomon hopes not

[18:24] <masak> no.

[18:24] <masak> S09 says you can index (specially declared) arrays as @array{-7} etc.

[18:24] <masak> having a different starting index than 0.

[18:24] <timotimo> ah

[18:25] <PerlJam> But we don't yet live in a world of shaped arrays.

[18:25] <masak> but I don't think that would ever reflect on the *actual* indexes, and thus not on .end either.

[18:25] <pmichaud> yes, the indexing function can have multiple arguments.

[18:25] <pmichaud> at least as implemented in rakudo.

[18:25] <masak> oh, right. with shaped arrays, it can.

[18:25] <pmichaud> r: my @a = <a b c d>;  say @a[*-*];

[18:25] <camelia> rakudo ef73eb: OUTPUT¬´a‚ê§¬ª

[18:26] <masak> oh, we're talking about arguments at different levels :)

[18:26] <pmichaud>         SELF[$block(|(SELF.elems xx $block.count))]

[18:26] <pmichaud>     }

[18:27] <PerlJam> masak: too bad you're not *arguing* about arguments at different levels.   ;)

[18:27] <timotimo> ah, ok, one per dimension?

[18:27] <timotimo> oh, huh

[18:27] <timotimo> it just gives the same argument every time

[20:00] <FROGGS> the second block is executed as Perl6, same goes for perl5 modules I 'use' from v5 blocks

[20:01] <FROGGS> for the 'use'-case I already pass around the :from<perl5> adverb, which currently just does the same as doing 'use Perl5' at the beginning of the included script

[20:02] *** pupoque_ left
[20:03] <jnthn> Hmm

[20:04] <FROGGS> maybe a slang has to provide a callback which has to be called right before every new slang block... I'm just curious what is missing to make a second slang block work, and what to put in an potentional callback

[20:06] <pmichaud> yes, I've noticed a few places where people are taking the NQP-jvm announcement to mean that Rakudo now runs on the JVM.  :-/

[20:06] <FROGGS> pmichaud: that is just because they are so exited...

[20:06] <jnthn> pmichaud: Which announcement? :-/

[20:07] <pmichaud> http://perlweekly.com/latest.html   for one.

[20:07] <pmichaud> Another huge step with Jonathan Worthington. NQP (Not Quite Perl) is basically the core that Rakudo, the Perl 6 compiler is built on. (Minus a few areas where I think it still depends directly on Parrot.) Having NQP on the JVM means a large part of Rakudo can already work on the JVM.

[20:07] *** arlinius left
[20:08] <jnthn> Well. I can't do much about people not reading what I write properly when they summarize it :/

[20:08] <pmichaud> we also had someone earlier asking for instructions for building Rakudo for the jvm.

[20:09] <[Coke]> GAH!

[20:09] <jnthn> ;)

[20:09] <flussence> .oO( use CORE:from<next tuesday> )

[20:10] <pmichaud> if we don't expect the May release to run on jvm, perhaps we should announce a "safe" date when it will.

[20:10] <FROGGS> well, publicity is actually a good thing, now someone just has to make a good post... (I'm not a good writer though)

[20:10] <[Coke]> I tried to build 

[20:10] <[Coke]> (nevermind)

[20:10] *** pupoque joined
[20:11] <pmichaud> as a strawman example, we could say we expect rakudo on the jvm in the 2013.08 release.  If parts start appearing before then, no problem. :)

[20:11] <pmichaud> anyway, it's just an idea.

[20:12] *** pupoque left
[20:12] <[Coke]> Eh. Given the very low bus number at this point, I'd be hesitant to promise anything.

[20:12] <pmichaud> that's reasonable, too.

[20:13] <pmichaud> I'm just thinking it's better to say when to expect it rather than have people constantly saying "it'll be here in the next release" or asking the question.

[20:13] <pmichaud> but I'm fine with not saying anything, too.

[20:14] <[Coke]> I think a reasonable fallback is we tell them the same thing they ask about when "rakudo will be done"

[20:14] <nwc10> can you say something like "we don't expect it to be ready for at least the next 3 monthly releases"

[20:14] <nwc10> or maybe "2"

[20:14] <nwc10> and not change "2" to "1" until it's more likely to be "0"

[20:14] <[Coke]> Sure, that seems reasonable.

[20:14] <pmichaud> we could say that, but I know that people will translate that to be "Rakudo will be released in July"

[20:14] <[Coke]> nwc10++

[20:14] <pmichaud> sorry, Rakudo-jvm

[20:14] <[Coke]> True.

[20:15] <[Coke]> but clearly, people can't read. What are we optimizing for?

[20:15] <spider-mario> that would be nice, though

[20:15] <pmichaud> [Coke]: the ones that can.

[20:15] <spider-mario> to have Rakujo released in a month beginning with J

[20:15] <nwc10> pmichaud: yes, but it's less dangerous than explicitly picking a "safe" month

[20:15] <nwc10> s/3/several/

[20:15] <pmichaud> sure, there are a lot of folks that can't read.  but I'm not sure we want to combate disinformation with silence.

[20:16] <pmichaud> *combat

[20:16] <nwc10> to avoid being pinned down on the number

[20:17] <pmichaud> spider-mario: that one I won't claim until we have a bunch of modules running on rakudo-jvm

[20:18] <spider-mario> and until it does run faster, I guess. :p

[20:18] <pmichaud> until then, speed comparisons are speculative at best, and probably best avoided.

[20:18] <diakopter> s/faster than/compared to/

[20:18] <spider-mario> well, it does need to run in the first place in order to run faster.

[20:21] <jnthn> It's also worth noting that my focus has been on "make it run" over "optimize everything I'm putting in loads as I do it"
