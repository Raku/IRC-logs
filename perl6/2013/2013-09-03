[02:29] <Mouq> Can one have a class with $.var as an lvalue and a setter method ( class.var('val') )? It seems like I'm missing something obvious that I can't get it work

[02:32] <TimToady> if it's declared 'has $.var is rw;' then you can just say $obj.var = 'val';

[02:32] <TimToady> but you need an object, not a class, unless you've declared it 'our' or 'my' instead of 'has', in which case you can use the uninstantiated type object

[02:33] <TimToady> (if that's what you were asking about)

[02:33] <TimToady> but we don't play getters/setters games in p6

[02:33] <Mouq> Yes. But I want to be able to chain, so $obj.var('val').doObjFunct as well as $obj.var = 'val'.

[02:34] <TimToady> ($obj.var = 'val).doObjFunct

[02:34] *** FROGGS joined
[02:34] <TimToady> but that's probably a design smell if you need to do that in your program

[02:34] <Mouq> Troo

[02:35] <TimToady> you can have setters if you like, as long as they aren't named the same as the attribute

[02:35] <TimToady> but the method that is the same as the attribute is specifically for identifying the attribute for subsequent operations, not for getting/setting

[02:36] <TimToady> well, you use it for getting, and the thing you get may be assignable if it's rw

[02:37] <TimToady> but we work hard at keeping identity as a separate concept from operations

[11:28] <lizmat> FROGGS++

[11:28] <FROGGS> lizmat: it is about operator precedence, see rakudo/src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp:3039:        Perl6::Grammar.O(':prec<y=>, :assoc<unary>, :dba<methodcall>, :fiddly<1>', '%methodcall');

[11:29] <FROGGS> so you can say that this token/rule has a specific precedence

[11:30] <lizmat> this is more about lines 3264 and 3271 in Perl6/Grammar.nqp

[11:31] <FROGGS> right

[11:31] <FROGGS> the second thing I posted is the operator precedence table

[11:37] <masak> I love that thing.

[11:37] <masak> there's something about it that makes Perl 6 very self-descriptive.

[11:38] <masak> or, should I say, Perl 6 is the only language I know that takes such a broad approach to parsing.

[11:38] <colomon> why does isa_ok(3, Nil); make sense?

[11:39] <masak> rn: say 3 ~~ Nil

[11:39] <moritz> it doesn't

[11:39] <camelia> rakudo 484f08, niecza v24-92-g3961d5d: OUTPUT«False␤»

[11:39] <moritz> but isa_ok(Nil, Nil) would make sense

[11:48] <FROGGS> masak: true, I tend to love that thing too :O)

[11:49] <colomon> why?  Nil isn't a type, is it?

[11:50] <moritz> it is.

[11:50] <masak> it used not to be.

[12:18] *** domidumont left

[12:31] <tadzik> wait, wat

[12:31] <tadzik> why does it make parsing so much longer? Is the code longer?

[12:32] <FROGGS> yeah, a Bag full of more lines

[12:34] <jnthn> lizmat: You got the patch that causes that? That's...odd.

[12:34] <flussence> nqp bisect done, 360e781cd09714b28b83f9cbb6aba2f466eb45d7 broke the Buf code

[12:35] <lizmat> the number of lines is minimal

[12:35] <FROGGS> it just hash to be slower...

[12:36] <jnthn> flussence: o.O

[12:36] <lizmat> golfing a bit further

[12:38] <flussence> (that's just the rakudo-parrot Buf.decode problem; I'm not sure about the rakudo-jvm signed ints thing)

[12:40] <lizmat> https://gist.github.com/lizmat/6423390

[12:41] <lizmat> making parse go from 131 to 150

[12:41] <jnthn> Wow.]

[12:41] <lizmat> also: with that patch, it doesn't build

[12:41] <lizmat> because of the serialization context bug

[12:49] <lizmat> doing the same with Bag, gives similar increase in parse time (just below 150 seconds)

[12:50] <jnthn> Well, it is forced to go ahead and compile the TypedHash role body when you want to do the mixin, I guess.

[12:51] <lizmat> wouldn't it more be because internally Sets/Bags are used, and they're slower

[12:51] <lizmat> actually, I just realized we don't need typed hashes for Set/KeySet

[12:52] <lizmat> instead, we could use a "normal" hash, use the .WHICH as the key, and the original value as the value

[12:52] <lizmat> and then mess with at_key and such

[12:53] <jnthn> lizmat: No, they're not used internally.

[12:53] <jnthn> lizmat: It's because of the on-demand comp...

[12:53] <jnthn> It should not be so expensive. I'm curious where the time goes.

[12:54] <lizmat> so compiling TypedHash takes ~20 seconds ?

[12:54] <lizmat> wow

[12:54] <jnthn> Yes, something feels a bit off there.

[12:54] <lizmat> I think there's something rotten

[12:54] <lizmat> and maybe *that* is causing the serialization problem

[12:54] <lizmat> because we have garbage in memory ?

[12:54] <jnthn> That doesn't quite follow for me...

[12:55] <jnthn> But I agree something is wrong if it takes so long.

[12:55] <lizmat> ok, need to go on our way to Amsterdam, for the amsterdam.pm meeting

[12:55] <jnthn> ok

[14:00] <mathw> hi froggs

[14:00] <masak> hi mathw! \o

[14:00] <mathw> just been having a discussion with a colleague about how to write code that doesn't suck

[14:01] <masak> I like that kind of code.

[14:01] <mathw> we do too

[14:01] <masak> I just taught a course about how to factor systems so they don't suck.

[14:01] <masak> we call the course "Software Architecture", which is totally a thing, because software is like houses.

[14:02] <mathw> the problem we have talking about it is that my interests are in functional and various cutting-edge languages, and he's always looking at how to best utilise the current Big Thing. So he talks about things like SOLID, while I'm looking to see if there's a way I can simulate the Either monad

[14:02] <mathw> hehe

[14:02] <mathw> but it's complicated, so many levels to it

[14:02] <mathw> what is the best way to give your program access to a database?

[14:03] <mathw> what is the right line to draw the abstraction around your database code on?

[14:03] <masak> sounds like there are many intersections between your discussions and our course.

[14:03] <mathw> probably

[14:03] <mathw> I tend to think that our usual approach to software betrays our inexperience

[14:03] <tadzik> heh, software is like houses. Well, is there any "X are like Y" that doesn't work for some reason? :)

[14:03] <mathw> we've only been doing it for 60 years or so, we need more practice

[14:03] <tadzik> ogres are like onions

[14:04] <diakopter> things are like non-things

[14:04] <PerlJam> software is like leeches

[14:04] <mathw> I'm enticed by the things people say about Lisp, but then I fall over the lack of static type checking of function parameters I mean really is that so hard?

[14:04] <masak> tadzik: any analogy has a part that fits and a part that doesn't fit. it's only a good analogy if the part that fits is dominant.

[14:04] <tadzik> true

[14:04] <masak> PerlJam: I know exactly what you mean :P

[14:05] <masak> diakopter: except they're a bit more... thing-y.

[14:05] <masak> decommute &

[14:05] <pmurias> mathw: re static type checking of function paramets there are statically typed lisps

[14:07] <mathw> I know about typed racket

[14:07] <mathw> that's what they're using as an exemplar for how to do it for Clojure

[17:22] <timotimo> i don't understand what you mean by "1000 times faster" :|

[17:23] <Faxmachinen> Shouldn't objects be initialized to some null object which has no methods by default?

[17:23] <Faxmachinen> Otherwise, what is .? for?

[17:23] <timotimo> variables that are not defined contain the type object

[17:23] <timotimo> that's why you can do my Dog $foo .= new

[17:27] <slava> timotimo: it's a reference to a simpsons episode where homer is getting faster internet (trouble finding a video clip of it)

[17:27] <timotimo> oh, ok

[17:28] <ingy> I want to do some work on some perl6 modules

[17:28] <ingy> what's the best build to use?

[17:29] <timotimo> well, a parrot based rakudo is currently your best bet for getting modules up and running comfortably

[17:30] <ingy> thx timotimo 

[17:30] <timotimo> the current versions of rakudo, that is after the latest star release, will warn you if you self.bless(*, ...), so that may get annoying fast

[17:31] <donaldh> ingy: you might be as well to use the latest star release

[17:31] <ingy> I can start with HEAD and switch to * if needed

[17:31] <timotimo> sounds good

[17:31] <timotimo> what modules did you have in mind? i think there's still work to be done for testml, which is a dependency for yaml. i suppose having a working yaml implementation would be beneficial, but of course you're free to do whatever you're most interested in at the moment

[17:37] <Faxmachinen> Ah, triple-equals, of course.

[17:37] <GlitchMr> Faxmachinen, class is like null in other programming languages.

[17:38] <GlitchMr> Also, ~~ is smartmatch, and in this case, it checks whatever first argument is instance of Foo.

[17:38] <Faxmachinen> GlitchMr. I suppose so. I'm complaining that it's not a very good null however :)

[17:38] <GlitchMr> It's typed null.

[17:39] <timotimo> Faxmachinen: you can smartmatch against Foo:D or check .defined

[17:43] <GlitchMr> :D seems to work in subroutines, but nowhere else for me.

[17:43] <TimToady> arguably a bug

[17:44] <TimToady> ingy: is there something wrong with just putting { say "footoken" } after you recognized the footoken?

[17:44] <slava> ls

[17:44] <slava> oops, sorry

[17:44] <ingy> TimToady: no, not at all. just asking :)

[17:45] <PerlJam> ingy: you could write a module that will auto-output token info  :)

[17:45] <TimToady> of course, if you ever want to backtrack, you've got trouble with side effects you can't take back

[17:45] <TimToady> so people usually parse bigger chunks and then crawl the tree

[17:45] <ingy> TimToady: of course, understood

[17:46] *** kbaker joined
[17:46] <Faxmachinen> I always thought it was strange that actions are performed before the match completes

[17:47] <ingy> More than likely I'll try to keep it down to 1 token lookahaed

[17:47] <Faxmachinen> Is there any way around it besides turning off backtracking?

[17:47] <TimToady> the usual action is to attach an ast to the match tree, which is safe in the face of backtracking

[17:48] <ingy> Faxmachinen: that's because you think of P6 regexes as regexes. (They are full-on parser generators)

[17:48] <TimToady> anything you attach to the current cursor will get thrown away if the cursor is thrown away to backtrack

[17:49] <Faxmachinen> True. Wouldn't you have to call methods manually afterwards if you attached them though?

[17:49] <TimToady> if you want to have delay actions, you can even attach closures to the tree, then trigger them as a separate pass

[17:49] <TimToady> *delayed

[17:49] <TimToady> sure, but one could abstract that

[17:49] <ingy> basically I want a streaming parser

[17:50] <ingy> so  I can only delay so much

[17:50] <TimToady> as long as you know the limits on backtracking, or that it can be parsed one-pass, you're fine

[17:50] * TimToady has a large preference for one-pass parsing

[17:51] <ingy> YAML was designed to be one pass

[17:51] <TimToady> then there should be no problem with immediate side effects

[17:51] <ingy> :)

[17:55] *** slavik left
[17:56] <TimToady> Faxmachinen: for instance, one could build up an ast that is basically just a list of all the closures you want to run once you commit; you'd just want a { make ... } variant that knows how to marshall those closures

[17:59] *** donaldh left
[18:01] <TimToady> a language that makes it really easy to generate a lazy list of closures doesn't really need special syntax for delayed actions, especially if you can write a macro or two to abstract it

[18:01] <TimToady> unlike, say, Snobol, where it's sort of a necessity

[18:02] <Faxmachinen> True. Is there sugar for executing each sub in an array?

[18:02] *** daxim left
[18:02] <TimToady> @array».() if you don't care about the order

[18:03] <Faxmachinen> Cool

[18:03] <TimToady> .() for @array if you do care

[18:04] <TimToady> or @array.map: *.()

[18:04] <Faxmachinen> Hmm, yes. One probably would care about the order when parsing

[18:04] <TimToady> there are two orders to care about

[18:04] <TimToady> hyper guarantees order of results, but not order of execution

[18:05] <TimToady> so it depends on, er, the dependencies

[19:46] <arnsholt> Derp?

[19:46] <arnsholt> Maybe I pastoed. 'Sec

[19:46] <arnsholt> Oh, oh!

[19:47] <arnsholt> moritz: You need to run it with nqp --vmlibs=nqp_dyncall_ops $file

[19:47] <arnsholt> To get the NativeCall ops

[19:48] <moritz> arnsholt: http://perlpunks.de/paste/show/52263cfe.31f3.3d2 that's what I get then

[19:48] <arnsholt> Yeah, that's the non-segfault problem that I get once in a while

[19:49] <arnsholt> Haven't figured that one out yet

[19:49] <moritz> and now I get

[19:49] <moritz> but I haven't got a segfault yet

[19:49] <arnsholt> Yeah, I've gotten that one too

[19:51] <arnsholt> And adding/removing code from the file seems to have some kind of influence, so it seems related to memory layout and such

[19:53] <moritz> now I got a segfault too :-)

[19:53] <arnsholt> Yay, I guess? =)

[19:54] <jnthn> Does invoking it directly with Parrot and supplying the -G (no GC) flag change things?

[19:54] <jnthn> That way you can know if it's GC related or not.

[19:56] <arnsholt> Kaboom, even with -G

[19:57] <jnthn> OK

[19:57] <jnthn> Just boring old memory corruption then I guess...

[19:58] <arnsholt> Yeah

[19:58] <arnsholt> Commenting out the nqp::nativecall ops doesn't change it, so it's not that op that's buggy it seems

[19:59] <arnsholt> There's no optimisation going on in NQP, right?

[19:59] <jnthn> Right

[20:00] <FROGGS> didnt timotimo++ added optimization stuff lately?

[20:01] <FROGGS> see: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commits?author=timo

[20:04] * arnsholt removes the optimise stage and tries again

[20:07] <arnsholt> Still segfault

[20:07] <arnsholt> Oh, hooray. This time I got a segfault in Parrot_pa_insert, while allocating a new Parrot string

[20:08] <arnsholt> [Coke] was right, it's infectious ludditism

[20:56] <colomon> curse rakudo and it's… no, wait, more rakudo passes are good.  did rakudo.jvm lose previously passing tests, or were 230 tests added but jvm doesn't pass them yet?

[21:40] <donaldh> I'm investigating how to implement qqx{ … } on JVM. It makes use of nqp::open($cmd, 'rp')

[21:41] <donaldh> I can spawn a process and attach it to a read IOHandle, so that's all good. 

[21:42] <donaldh> The problem is that I need $*CWD and $*ENV to successfully launch a process.

[21:43] *** EvanTeitelman left
[21:43] <donaldh> To correctly support chdir emulation, we will need these parameters to spawn processes on all backends.

[21:44] <jnthn> donaldh: Maybe just define an nqp::openpipe or so

[21:44] *** EvanTeitelman joined
[21:44] *** EvanTeitelman is now known as doxit

[21:44] <donaldh> jnthn: that's what I was going to suggest too :-)

[21:45] <donaldh> I'm just worried about diverging from spec or expectations.

[21:46] <jnthn> donaldh: Well, nqp:: ops are an implementation detail, we get to spec those ;)

[21:47] <jnthn> It makes sense to me to do it that way, anyways

[21:47] <jnthn> otoh, I'm sleep deprived :)

[21:47] <jnthn> And didn't have any beer yet today.

[21:47] <jnthn> So heck knows if I'm thinking clearly. :)

[21:48] <donaldh> oh noes

[21:48] <donaldh> what a terrible situation to find yourself in

[21:48] <jnthn> Well, I guess I can fix the beer easy enough :)

[21:48] <donaldh> I'm happy to go ahead with what you've suggested.

[21:48] <jnthn> And maybe then I'll sleep well tonight :)

[21:49] *** denis_boyun left
[21:49] <jnthn> donaldh: Go for it, I wasn't that keen on parsing the p out of the string to see it's pipe mode anyway.

[21:50] <donaldh> It's much cleaner to have a separate nqp op

[21:50] <jnthn> donaldh: Probably an nqp::openpipe fits more naturally on MoarVM too :)

[21:50] <donaldh> That's good!
