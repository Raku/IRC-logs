[08:05] <moritz> will hopefully be fixed as soon as the template cache expires

[08:05] <moritz> that is, in 10 minutes

[08:06] <timotimo> cache expiry: one of the harder problems in computer science

[08:06] <moritz> nah, already fixed

[08:06] <moritz> FROGGS++

[08:07] * timotimo has an idea brewing in his head for a cool perl6-related project

[08:08] <BenGoldberg> Does perl6-related mean written in perl6, or merely inspired by perl6?

[08:51] <timotimo> hm, so a state var in method new can be used to implement singletons, right?

[09:08] <moritz> FROGGS++ # advent calendar

[09:09] <FROGGS> moritz: mainline rakudo? what do you mean?

[09:09] <FROGGS> ahh, that you need to recompile it to use it?

[09:09] <moritz> FROGGS: it's in your fork of rakudo, right?

[09:11] <moritz> also

[09:11] <moritz> mlenz@mlenz-workstation:~/p6/rakudo$ ./perl6-p -e 'my $x = "123abc"; $x++; say $x'

[09:11] <moritz> doesn't fail

[09:13] <FROGGS> ahh true

[09:14] <FROGGS> moritz: it is not a fork

[09:16] <moritz> FROGGS: is it a branch? or is it in rakudo/rakudo branch nom?

[09:18] <FROGGS> it is nom + a tiny patch that needs to be applied (that is shown in v5's README)

[09:19] <FROGGS> but yes, I will make clear how one gets v5

[09:20] <FROGGS> p: say "123abc" + 1

[17:34] <timotimo> not sure if i like that. oh well.

[17:43] <[Coke]> I like his new p6 version better than mine. ah well.

[17:43] <[Coke]> still no reason for that to take 8s

[17:43] <timotimo> but it's much slower ;)

[17:43] <timotimo> you could tell him that he could use @multiples[] instead of {@multiples}

[17:44] <timotimo> and ..^ $max instead of .. $max - 1

[17:47] *** panchiniak joined
[17:47] <Ulti> isnt the 8s coming from JVM startup time

[17:48] <[Coke]> quite possibly.

[17:48] <Ulti> nearly everything I do with the JVM version of Rakudo takes 8s big or small :) its an oracle that has constant time for hard or easy problems with sufficiently small input size

[18:03] <Ulti> doh

[18:03] <Ulti> I guess 0.1s is a big deal for people worried about times like this :S

[18:03] <Ulti> an 8 second overhead on startup is basically meaningless for me when my Perl scripts run for days or weeks

[18:04] <timotimo> well, with jvm they would rather take days than weeks :)

[18:04] <Ulti> no I mean Perl 5! lol

[18:04] *** dbrock joined
[18:05] <timotimo> oh, ok

[18:06] <Ulti> considering perl 6 in that example is ~20x slower if we had autothreading you could argue Perl 6 could be as fast on my desktop since it has 24 cores

[18:36] <Ulti> I think modules.perl6.org needs an extra medal for "compiles without error"

[18:37] <FROGGS> that is what colomon++ does

[18:37] <Ulti> orly?

[18:37] <Ulti> as in thats a thing displayed on the module list page, or colomon is testing the ecosystem?

[18:37] <FROGGS> he said a few days ago that he should make his smoke results available properly

[18:38] <FROGGS> he's testing all modules

[18:38] <Ulti> yeah that would be really worthwhile

[18:38] <FROGGS> but there is no site where you can see it

[18:38] <Ulti> is the source for modules.perl6.org not commitable?

[18:42] <colomon> nicer looking graphics for the page broke sometime recently, haven't looked into why.

[19:01] <Ulti> colomon I have a feeling some of them are abandonware, bioperl6 feels like it anyway

[19:01] <colomon> I'm sure that's it.

[19:01] <Ulti> %data{"$!min_$pos"} assuming $!min is a private member of the class how can you put that in for string interpolation?

[19:02] <Ulti> $!{min} isnt right

[19:02] <colomon> probably we should have a concerted clean up campaign, fixing the modules that can be fixed and removing the rest from the ecosystem.

[19:02] <timotimo> no, it would be {$!min}

[19:02] <Ulti> aha

[19:02] <colomon> but it doesn't fit in my schedule right now……

[19:02] <timotimo> what you put between { } is full-fledged perl6 code

[19:16] <arnsholt> Yeah, it's usually worthwhile to run a segfault through gdb first

[19:16] <arnsholt> A lot cheaper than valgrind, and sometimes the bug is reasonably localised

[19:39] *** BenGoldberg left
[19:39] <TimToady> you'd use gdb on the actual command, which means you might have to look through the wrapper shell scripts first to find the real command

[19:39] *** beastd joined

[20:14] <[Coke]> timotimo: instead of putting it in a try/eval, I'd put it in a block, then impl. can skip the block if needed.

[20:15] <[Coke]> also, add a comment mentioning the RT when adding testneeded tests.

[20:15] <[Coke]> timotimo++

[20:15] <timotimo> i'd rather suggest putting a block around the whole thing

[20:16] <timotimo> because if there's no try/eval it'll blow up at compile-time

[20:18] <[Coke]> not if you skip the block.

[20:18] <[Coke]> (that's what fudging is for)

[20:19] <[Coke]> just my 2¢.

[20:19] <tadzik> timotimo: should be better now

[20:22] <timotimo> [Coke]: what do you think about replacing try eval q{ with do { ...?

[20:22] <lue> (not that I can run perl6-m, it merely finishes CORE.setting)

[20:24] *** swaggot left
[20:30] <[Coke]> timotimo: the standard at the moment seems to be ala S32-list/first.t 's setup - small blocks of self contained tests that you can #?skip if you want.

[20:30] <[Coke]> s/want/need/

[20:30] <timotimo> right

[20:31] <timotimo> that's not what i meant, though

[20:31] *** bluescreen10 left
[20:31] <[Coke]> what advantage does using a do block give?

[20:32] <timotimo> it makes a lexical scope so that the $/ doesn't leak around and grabs the last value inside it for our return value

[20:33] <timotimo> oh, sorry about that

[20:48] <BenGoldberg> In lisp, (prog1 foo bar blatch) evaluates each of foo bar and blotch, and it's return value is whatever foo evaluated as

[20:49] * lue has had it with panda and its brokenness.

[20:49] <BenGoldberg> Kinda like, in perl5, (do { foo() }, do { bar() }, do { blatch })[0]

[20:50] <tadzik> lue: I know the feeling

[20:51] <lue> Honestly, it's much faster/better/* to use a (slightly modified) ufo, even if lacking the warm and fuzzy insulation of a package manager :) .

[20:54] *** FROGGS joined
[20:56] * lue will hesitantly try panda once FROGGS' S11 work is completed.

[20:56] <FROGGS> yeah

[20:57] <FROGGS> need to discuss with jnthn and tadzik, and then we need to test every possible scenario :o)

[20:58] <lue> :) I just hope the S11 changes de-break panda, though it seems to be an issue with parrot magically not doing things sometimes. :/

[20:59] <FROGGS> hmmm

[21:00] <FROGGS> the only thing my S11 changes to panda do is that it delegated the work of the .install method

[21:00] <lue> I noticed that the random build failures seem to be a result of parrot *not even trying the command*, judging by how much faster I got "False" results v. the "True" results.

[21:01] <FROGGS> a proper test case would help

[21:01] <FROGGS> but sounds like there is none :/

[21:02] <lue> FROGGS: a non-random failure would help with that. e.g. just before I deleted my panda repo out of frustration, I got a totally brand-new failure on Shell::Command, which I'd not seen previously.

[21:02] *** dayangkun left
[21:03] <lue> (my blaming of parrot comes from previously-seen parrotland errors.)

[21:03] <FROGGS> if it is reproduceable then pull request that failing test or make an issue please

[21:04] <lue> FROGGS: I'm failing the (re)bootstrap.pl script during panda's Builder usage. I'm not sure of any relevant test cases.

[21:04] <lue> (And the failures are reproducible to a point; but like I mentioned it has a nasty habit of changing behavior somehow.)

[21:08] *** rurban1 joined
[21:09] <lue> hmm, I want to see what happens if I replace all instances of shell() with qqx...

[21:15] *** ivanshmakov left
[21:17] *** dayangkun joined
[21:20] <lue> *sigh* and now I've got a failure on JSON/Tiny.pm >.<

[21:23] <lue> I'm still placing the blame on parrot, 'cos I've yet to get a hint pointing elsewhere :/

[21:24] <FROGGS> lue: what is your PERL6LIB btw?

[21:24] <FROGGS> and your @*INC ?

[21:24] <FROGGS> because recompiling panda's deps requires a special path ordering

[21:25] <lue> FROGGS: $ echo $PERL6LIB

[21:25] <lue> $ perl6 -e 'say @*INC'

[21:25] <lue> </usr/local/lib/parrot stuff> /home/matthew/.perl6/2013.10-315-ga6eeb0b/lib

[21:25] <FROGGS> maybe not soo special: the directory it wants install to must come before the panda/ext/JSON__Tiny or so

[21:26] <lue> FROGGS: this is the *build* step that's failing, the one that generates the .pir

[21:26] <FROGGS> it does that in the bootstrap script, but maybe that fails?

[21:26] <lue> FROGGS: https://gist.github.com/lue/01c2f45754f97f98460a

[21:27] <lue> (the install dirs should not have an effect on the build process)

[21:28] <FROGGS> can you insert a --ll-exception after the $*EXE_NAME? https://gist.github.com/lue/01c2f45754f97f98460a#file-diffs-so-you-can-replicate-above-L13

[21:29] * lue tries that

[21:29] <FROGGS> I had expected that it fails building something that has deps

[21:30] <lue> FROGGS: I should let you know that the "git diff", if gen'd now, would look different from that, as well as what in bootstrap.pl fails. I only gave you that link to give you a representative example of the issue.

[21:30] <FROGGS> k

[21:30] <FROGGS> does this command there build the .pir? https://gist.github.com/lue/01c2f45754f97f98460a#file-manual-try-at-failing-panda-command-L1

[21:31] <FROGGS> if not then you can put the --ll-exeption there

[21:31] <lue> FROGGS: whenever I do a manual run of a failing file, I get a real file out of it.

[21:31] <FROGGS> --ll-exception*

[21:31] <FROGGS> k

[21:31] <FROGGS> I had that too when fiddling with S11

[21:32] *** sqirrel_ left
[21:32] <FROGGS> IIRC it failed because of "out of memory"

[21:32] <FROGGS> (according to parrot)

[21:33] <lue> FROGGS: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-12-15#i_8004264  :)

[21:33] <FROGGS> :S

[21:34] <FROGGS> if I could remember what fixed it for me...

[21:34] * lue considers writing a parrot detonation script, to be more dramatic about the day he switches to MoarVM ...

[21:36] * FROGGS .oO( CTRL+a CTRL+d )

[21:36] <lue> I don't get anything by adding --ll-exception, so it truly seems to be an issue with the norwegian blue executing commands.

[21:36] <timotimo> how do i format in-line code snippets in wordpress?

[21:37] <FROGGS> I use <pre> >.<

[21:37] <timotimo> that's not in-line

[21:37] <timotimo> apparently i can use <code>

[21:37] <FROGGS> ahh, yes

[21:45] <lue> [Coke]: when Parrot is preventing me from using a pretty important piece of software, I think it quite deserves it.

[21:47] <FROGGS> lue: prove it that it is parrots fault

[21:48] <lue> FROGGS: the one and only singular error message I have ever gotten comes from the parrot source code. Seems to me, a little bit, that Parrot is to blame.

[21:54] <[Coke]> ?

[21:55] <lue> [Coke]: not that I'm aware of. This issue pops up semi-randomly, so I'm not sure what use a ticket is until I figure out the root cause.

[21:55] <takadonet> phenny, tell Ulti that bioperl6 is not abandonware just myself and cjfields were waiting for some elements of the spec to stop changing. We did start the port a few ago so some code looks very  old. Hoping to start working on it asap.

[21:55] <takadonet> ... did not think that worked

[21:58] <[Coke]> ... oh. we can't call back into perl6 code from java yet, making me doubt we could implement an interface.

[21:58] <timotimo> no, we can implement interfaces

[21:58] <timotimo> at least some ...

[21:58] *** takadonet left
[21:58] <timotimo> there really isn't an update with B, just with I or B[]

[21:58] <timotimo> is that how you spell it?

[21:58] <timotimo> byte[] is the type in the signature

[21:58] <[Coke]> the error and the callback were separate questions, btw.

[21:59] <lue> [Coke]: I see now that it's probably NQP to blame, but I'm still blaming parrot until I know for sure what's happening. How often do parrot errors bleed through and assume the guise of a higher-level error?

[22:01] <timotimo> meeeeh, my java_interop_dispatchers branch stopped working altogether :(

[22:01] <[Coke]> timotimo: using (I) gives me This representation can not unbox to a native int

[22:01] <timotimo> right, because you have a whole buffer

[22:02] <timotimo> rather than just a single integer

[22:02] <timotimo> you could write for @$_ at the end, though :P

[22:02] <timotimo> but yeah, the example needs fixed

[22:02] *** PacoAir left
[22:03] <lue> [Coke]: I was honestly asking how often the errors bleed through. It's why I still place blame on Parrot, really. Because I don't know if that bleed-through is normal or the fault of parrot messing up.

[22:04] <lue> (adding ll-exception for the script itself revealed nothing :/)

[22:05] * [Coke] sticks with straight java for now. (sadface)

[22:05] *** FROGGS left
[22:08] <lue> Come to think of it, how would NQP cause Parrot to claim it can't allocate memory? ...

[22:10] <lue> If I'm reading the stacktrace correctly, it's not actually showing me to where in the qqx/shell/run/* execution the error pops up.

[22:11] <timotimo> jnthn: did you see coke's concerns with the java interop post?

[22:17] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, I only talk code I had run successfully at some point...didn't verify it on latest, and assumed it'd keep on working. Odd that it woulda broke, though.

[22:17] <jnthn> *took code

[22:18] <timotimo> strange, yeah

[22:18] <jnthn> Though, the whole really needs some tests writing.

[22:19] <jnthn> Otherwise we'll never know when it breaks.
