[00:15] <rurban> census: cygwin questions please @ #cygwin. And install gcc-4 as the error says, not gcc-3.

[00:16] <census> rurban: thanks! i did post to #cygwin -- but there are not many perl folks there.  i have been downloading gcc-4 for the past 2 horus now.  at 95%  hopefully will find out the answer soon! :)

[00:17] <rurban> Net::SSL is in the package perl_vendor

[00:17] <rurban> find a faster mirror also :)

[00:19] <census> rurban: what do you mean by mirror?

[00:19] <census> and do you mean i should be downloading perl_vendor from cygwin?

[00:19] <colomon> labster: it might be worth looking in roast for that one, though my first inclination is you are right.

[00:19] <census> dakopter!  where ddi you go?

[00:20] <diakopter> here

[00:20] <diakopter> as my last msg said

[00:20] <diakopter> :P

[00:20] <census> OH

[00:20] <census> i was confused

[00:20] <census> i'm at 99%!

[00:20] <census> what does rurban mean?

[00:21] <rurban> rurban is my name

[00:21] <diakopter> *headdesk*, or, alternately, "heh"

[00:22] <census> i meant what did you mean in what you said earlier about the mirror and perl_vendor

[00:22] <rurban> I'm the perl maintainer for cygwin, but #perl6 has nothing to do with it

[00:22] <census> diakopter!  what is wrong?

[00:22] <census> rurban -- you are!

[00:22] <diakopter> I was being silly

[00:22] <census> omg! :)

[00:22] <census> awww

[00:22] <census> i got sad :(

[00:22] <census> i thought you were mad at me :(

[00:22] <diakopter> no I was giggling at rurban's reply, which was ambiguously not tongue-in-cheek, so I replied both ways :)

[00:23] <labster> colomon: One of the examples of class composition is: C<< <[_]+alpha+digit> >>

[00:23] <colomon> labster: that certainly is very suggestive.  ;)

[00:23] *** sivoais left
[00:23] <rurban> Well, I try to answer literally

[00:23] <diakopter> census: please google what is an internet mirror

[00:23] <labster> emotion is hard to feel though IRC

[00:23] *** sivoais joined
[00:23] <census> ok! :)

[00:24] <census> and what is meant by: "Net::SSL is in the package perl_vendor" ?

[00:24] <labster> that's why we need to smile :) and raise our hands in the air \o/

[00:24] <diakopter> labster: oh! I always thought those were legs!

[00:25] <rurban> census: you should 1. find a faster mirror within the setup.exe mirror selection listbox, and 2. install the perl_vendor package if you need Net:SSL. Net::SSLey needs to be installed via cpan. Therefore you need to install 3. gcc-4

[00:25] <labster> diakopter: oh, huh.  Oh!  Oh!  can't unsee :/

[00:25] <census> how do i know which mirror is fastest?

[00:26] <diakopter> you just have to try different ones

[00:26] <rurban> See what perl_vendor contains with the package search: http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=perl_vendor%2Fperl_vendor-5.14.2-3&grep=perl_vendor

[00:26] <rurban> and I have to go now... :)

[00:27] <census> oh no!

[00:27] <census> so you think now that i almost have gcc4 i should be able to install LWP::Protocol::socks, which needs Net::SSLeay ?

[00:28] <lue> labster: S02/Names: "Underscore is always considered alphabetic." (presumably extends to regex rules too, at least S05 seems to imply it (S05/Simplified lexical parsing of patterns, see plaintext table))

[00:29] <census> help

[00:29] <census> It says:

[00:29] <census> "These tests *will* *fail* if you do not have network connectivity. [n]"  

[00:29] <census> I think I do have network connectivity ...

[00:29] <diakopter> census: I suspect rurban was giving you an alternative (Net::SSL), so I don't think you need to install perl_vendor right now

[00:30] <diakopter> so yes, try installing the same thing you did earlier

[00:30] <census> ok thanks!

[00:30] <census> i'll try that next

[00:30] <census> i'm doing cpan install Net::SSLeay right now

[00:30] <census> the gcc4 JUST finished

[00:32] <census> diakopter: so how should i answer that question? y or n

[00:32] <census> the default seem n

[00:32] <census> i never got that q before!

[00:32] <diakopter> what question

[00:33] *** sivoais joined
[00:33] <census> it is prompting me now

[00:33] <census> Do you want to run external tests?  These tests *will* *fail* if you do not have network connectivity. [n]

[00:34] <diakopter> census: y

[00:34] <census> ok.  said looks good for kit being complete :)

[00:34] * lue thinks hyphen should be part of the definition of <alpha> if underscore is there.

[00:34] <census> but i don't think it worked

[00:35] <census> not sure

[00:35] <census> http://scsys.co.uk:8002/239036?ln=on&tidy=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!

[00:37] <labster> oh right, subtraction

[00:38] <lue> ? I would think <ident> means identifier, which according the S02 section I cited is the "foo" in $foo, which allows hyphens..

[00:44] <diakopter> I did, and found you need to install the libmpfr library in the cygwin package manager

[00:45] <diakopter> it's not apparent to me why you pasted that url

[00:45] <census> oh i'm sorry

[00:45] <census> i thought you asked me if i googled

[00:45] <census> and i wanted to show you what i googled

[00:45] <diakopter> oh. :)

[00:46] <census> so i need libmpfr ?

[00:46] <census> there are 8 options ....2 of hiwhc i apparently already have ...

[00:46] <census> i have libmpfr1 in libs and math

[00:46] <diakopter> is there one with 4 in the name?

[00:46] <census> yes!

[00:46] <census> libmpf4 in libs, libmpf4 in math

[00:47] <census> lifmpfr-devel in libs; lifmbfr-devel in math; lastly, libmpfr0 in obsolete.  7 total.

[00:49] <diakopter> seems the missing dependency is a bug in the cygwin package

[00:49] <census> are you implying then taht i should download the libmpf4 from the libs and from math?

[00:49] <diakopter> for gcc

[00:49] <diakopter> they're the same package

[00:49] <diakopter> one will do

[00:50] <census> ok!  thank goodness this one seems muchfaster!

[01:06] <labster> so we could compare how awesome Perl 6 is compared to the LTA Perl 5, I think he means.

[01:08] <diakopter> <squint> p5 has its detriments, but I'm surprised anyone thinks they outweight the current p6 implementations' detriments..

[01:09] <diakopter> I mean, the "ideal" p6, sure

[09:19] <labster> I promised I'd blog about being a Perl 6 user, so here it is:  http://brentlaabs.blogspot.com/2013/04/why-i-use-perl-6.html

[09:19] <masak> \o/

[09:19] <labster> Of course, I had to actually start a blog to do this (I'm much more of a wiki person myself)

[09:20] <masak> you could always get a bliki ;)

[09:22] <masak> labster++ # excellent post

[09:22] <masak> labster: I wish we had a hundred delurkers like you :)

[09:22] <masak> you hear that, you hundred lurkers? :)

[09:24] <FROGGS> labster++ # that makes me think of start blogging too

[09:26] <labster> That tiny regex example really impressed census++ earlier today, so I felt like sharing.  From doing all of the porting of File::Spec, I have to say that I now am now quite sick of P5-style regexes and very happy to be working with the P6 version.

[09:27] <FROGGS> labster: that is exactly what I am thinking

[09:28] <FROGGS> a year ago it was like: damn have to do PHP while there is such a wonderful Perl 5 out there

[09:28] <FROGGS> now I feel almost the same for Perl 5 like I do for PHP :o)

[09:28] <FROGGS> (but there is still a huge gap between PHP and Perl 5)

[09:32] <labster> no kidding

[09:33] <labster> PHP, Python, and Perl are all crazy people.  Perl is crazy in a eccentric, mildly but happily intoxicated way.  PHP is crazy in a more manic-depressive way, where you never really know what to expect.  Python is the obsessive-compulsive, where everything must be just so or it'll get upset.

[12:18] <FROGGS> Woodi_: there is none yet as far as I know

[12:18] <timotimo> that's true

[12:18] <Woodi_> just wanted to confirm, no problem for me

[12:19] <masak> Woodi_! \o/

[12:19] <Woodi_> btw. is there any TeamSpeak3 server for perl6 ? :)

[12:23] <masak> IRC is my teamspeak.

[12:23] <Woodi_> you see, irc is used by software devs and gamers+devs. but gamers (and their devs) use voice coms too 

[12:23] <Woodi_> mumble is gpl :0

[12:24] <Woodi_> I would love to lurk on perl6 voice coms :)

[12:24] <timotimo> i prefer mumble over ts3, but i do have to admit ts3 has some neat features.

[12:25] <Woodi_> but more seriously: there is a 'cache' inside perl6 implementations... can it be used as 'module' or like hash ?

[12:25] <daxim> http://modules.perl6.org/#Cache::Memcached

[12:26] <Woodi_> daxim: it's bindings library ?

[12:26] <daxim> I haven't looked at the code, have you?

[12:28] <Woodi_> yes (in a sec) :)

[12:29] <timotimo> that anchor doesn't seem to work :o

[12:29] <Woodi_> it's library for Memcache :)

[12:30] <Woodi_> but I was thinking about reusing internals of implementations... you know, hashes sometimes are used internally, so maybe caches and other thing can be maked available for general use...

[14:33] <arnsholt> timotimo: From a skim of some of the docs, doesn't look entirely unreasonable

[14:33] <arnsholt> As long as it doesn't need callbacks. 'Cause those appear to be broken =(

[14:34] <timotimo> i'll just avoid callbacks if they are not required and stall the project if they are

[14:34] <timotimo> or maybe the parrot people. who knows!

[15:23] <moritz> what kind of equivalence testing? infix:<eqv>?

[15:38] <timotimo> if there's a struct i want to bind, do i just have to say "is native 'TCOD_color_t'" and put a has int8 $.r and $.g and $.b in there if that's what the struct looks like in c?

[15:39] <timotimo> ah, ok

[15:39] <moritz> and then you use the new type as a type constraint

[15:39] <timotimo> can i give it a different name and use is symbol('TCOD_color_t')?

[15:41] <timotimo> ah,good

[17:38] <FROGGS> hmmm, do you have several nqp's?

[17:39] <japhb> Lots.  But I generally build with --gen-parrot, so I get a local NQP

[17:39] <FROGGS> and there is no other nqp in path?

[17:39] <FROGGS> that's just a guess, but that is treally something that causes trouble

[18:25] <tadzik> japhb: pandabrew is just a convenience wrapper over panda

[18:25] <tadzik> so it automatically detects when you've updated rakudo and need to rebootstrap panda

[18:26] <japhb_> Looks like a lib path mismatch.  Perl6::BOOTSTRAP exists in ./install/lib/parrot/4.10.0-devel/languages/nqp/lib/Perl6/BOOTSTRAP.pbc , but panda is looking in .../install/lib/parrot/4.10.0-devel/languages/perl6/lib

[18:26] * japhb_ wonders why the mismatch between his rakudo and FROGGS'

[18:26] *** colomon left
[18:27] <tadzik> FROGGS may be using his own hacked Rakudo :)

[18:27] * tadzik tries locally

[18:29] <japhb_> tadzik, Ah.  I have a bash script that does the rakudo rebuild and panda rebootstrap, which takes care to save backup copies of the state file in case Rakudo can't rebuild, or rebuilds but only gets partway through the panda installs before failing, or the machine crashes partway through the process

[18:29] <tadzik> I want pandabrew to do all that

[19:22] <census> hi!  does anybody know the channel in which people might be familiar with Tor?  

[19:23] <moritz> have you tried #tor?

[19:23] <moritz> that would be my very first try :-)

[19:23] <census> just now!  and i'm there alone :(

[19:23] <moritz> maybe ##tor

[19:24] <nwc10> they seem to be on a different IRC network: https://www.torproject.org/about/contact.html.en#irc

[19:24] <census> i find nottor ... not sure if that's the same thing!

[19:25] <census> nwc10: does different irc network mean that i cannot join # room name from here?

[19:25] <census> thank you for that link! :)

[19:25] <masak> census: yes, it means that.

[19:25] <nwc10> correct, you can't join it from here just using /join

[19:25] <masak> census: your IRC client joins different networks. this is the freenode network.

[19:26] <census> oh ... is that the thing with xchat?  (although my xchat expired ...)

[19:26] <masak> census: if you haven't joined the network where the Tor channel is, you can't join the channel either.

[19:26] <masak> census: think of it like countries and cities. to go to the right city, you first have to be in the right country :)

[19:26] <masak> there's no Stockholm in France.

[19:27] <census> yes ... and i don't even know how to read the map .. or where to buy one :(

[19:29] <sorear> hmm, freenode web irc

[19:35] <masak> then you'll be on the right network.

[19:35] <flussence> It probably took longer to ask that question than to just try it.

[20:28] <moritz> laziness gap?

[20:29] <masak> the reluctance to switch, I guess.

[20:29] <PerlJam> p5 has mostly eager evaluations, while p6 has mostly lazy evaluations.

[20:29] <PerlJam> Getting people used to this is the problem.

[20:30] <masak> oh!

[20:30] <masak> it's only lists that are lazy, though.

[20:32] <PerlJam> and lists are used everywhere.

[20:37] *** bluescreen10 joined
[20:40] <PerlJam> To me, it's one of those underlying currents throughout the language.   Like when you've only spoken a language that only had present-tense and then you learn about a language with both past and future tenses too.  Your thinking has to adapt to these new concepts for you to effectively use the language.

[20:40] <PerlJam> (okay, I might be getting a little extreme in my comparison  ;)

[20:42] <PerlJam> anyway, it's a difference that's more "within the programmer" than "within the language" IMHO

[21:33] <FROGGS> timotimo: I had problems using types at all

[21:33] <timotimo> oh, i think i recognize the type of error!

[21:33] <FROGGS> so I'd try to pass ($c, $h, $s, $v ..

[21:34] <timotimo> last time i got it it was when i passed a class that's not composed yet!

[21:35] <timotimo> i'm still getting wrong results and segfaults, though

[21:36] <PerlJam> timotimo: pastebin the whole code?

[21:36] <timotimo> haha, in the GC of all places :)

[21:43] <census> hi labster!

[21:43] <timotimo> how do i tell it the structure of Color? (originally called TCOD_color_t)

[21:43] <labster> hi census

[21:44] <labster> I saw the backlog.  That was an awful lot of ++es.  Thanks guys.

[21:44] <PerlJam> timotimo: just like in README.markdown in the zavolaj distribution.

[21:44] <census> labster++

[21:44] <PerlJam> labster++ have some more.  :)

[21:45] <labster> lol census++ (PerlJam++)++

[21:45] <FROGGS> timotimo: line 33-35 tells it its structure

[21:46] <timotimo> oooh, a readme. that would have been too obvious for me :D

[21:46] <PerlJam> timotimo: why are all of your subs declared with "our"?

[21:47] <timotimo> i'm not good at this modules thing.

[21:47] <timotimo> i thought it would be okay to expose both a class-based interface and the methods from the library "directly"

[21:47] <timotimo> should i have used "is export" instead?

[21:48] <PerlJam> timotimo: I probably would have, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing for you  :)

[21:49] <timotimo> right. so what's wrong about the way i created the class?

[21:49] <timotimo> ah, in the paste i had the traits only once, in the stub

[21:49] <FROGGS> nqp: say ord('?')

[21:49] <timotimo> but it doesn't make it work if i repeat the "is repr" trait in the implementation

[22:12] <labster> okay, how am I supposed to change the working directory in only a local scope?

[22:14] <Tene> have an exit handler change back.

[22:14] <Tene> that's dynamic scope, though, not lexical.

[22:14] <lizmat> wrt to earlier underscore discussion: S02L2526 states: "Underscore is always considered alphabetic"

[22:29] <lizmat> Hi ingy

[22:29] <ingy> :)

[22:31] * lizmat calls it a night

[22:31] <labster> The problem with my expectation of unicode classes clashes with the fact that the language uses the grammar more than my code does.  You can use the property directly if you have ICU installed (which I don't :( ), or just tell people to match <+alpha-[_]> if they mean to -- which is how I changed the spec.

[22:31] <lizmat> night #perl6

[22:53] <FROGGS> census: you might google for office/word problems, you should find your answers there

[22:53] <census> yep ... trying :)

[22:54] <timotimo> also there's a built-in help tool that you can ask questions in human language, i believe

[22:55] <census> hahaha yes i need human language :)

[22:55] <timotimo> in the past i've also found answers to things on stack overflow (some excel formula weirdness)

[22:56] <timotimo> so, i still have no idea what is wrong with my nativecall usage :(

[22:57] <census> do peopole actually check that?
