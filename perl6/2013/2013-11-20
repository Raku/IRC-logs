[08:03] <tadzik> moritz: yeah, the reason is that sometimes a non-zero exit status is returned even if everything went fine

[08:03] <tadzik> that's why there are no other error messages from the command ran

[09:02] <lizmat> would appreciate a set of eyes on the announcement / ChangeLog for omissions / errors

[09:07] * moritz has trouble believing that this "Elizabeth Mattijsen" had the least number of commits among all the contributors this month

[09:08] <lizmat> probably a copy/paste error  :-)

[09:08] <moritz> I think 'grondilu' und L. Grondin are actually the same

[09:08] <moritz> and the 'foo' there should probably removed

[09:08] <lizmat> and who/s foo?

[09:08] <moritz> well, the script looks for strings like 'TimToady++'

[09:09] <moritz> and adds those ++'ed folks to the list of contributors

[09:09] <moritz> so I guess somebody wrote $foo++

[09:30] <timotimo> oh, oh, oh, should i get eqat into the stage0 and use it all over nqp to make it three times faster! (if it didn't do anything but substr+eq checks, that is)

[09:31] <FROGGS> timotimo: if you intend to do it, then do it now, so there is time to test

[09:31] <FROGGS> for a certain definition of "now" :o)

[09:33] *** xinming left
[09:34] <timotimo> hm. should i worry about getting WINNER into rakudo before its release this month?

[09:34] <FROGGS> no idea... my feeling is that there will be still a lot of movement and renaming

[09:36] <timotimo> mhm

[09:37] <timotimo> maybe i could get for -> $a, $b? working in nqp-parrot at least?

[09:37] <timotimo> (which also causes better error messages in the case of having a too-short list for $a, $b, $c, even without "?"

[09:37] <timotimo> so that would be nice)

[09:38] <FROGGS> will a user hit that issue?

[09:38] *** arnsholt_ is now known as arnsholt

[09:38] <timotimo> hopefully not

[09:38] <timotimo> except if they're a nqp user

[09:38] <FROGGS> k

[09:38] <timotimo> and developing a new language compiler i suppose

[09:39] <timotimo> stage0 upgrades are so expensive :(

[09:39] <FROGGS> yeah :/

[09:39] <timotimo> yeah, i'll keep waiting until somebody really needs a new stage0 for something very worthwhile, and *then* i'll spread eqat all over nqp

[09:39] *** denisboyun joined
[09:39] <timotimo> it's already in the code the regex compiler creates, for example, so that's a step in the right direction

[09:40] <timotimo> and the "lexreg optimisation" i made is mostly a cause for compilation failure, rather than any meaningful performance improvement

[09:42] <timotimo> optimising rakudo seems hard. there seems to be a big thing that's slow that i'm just not getting my hands on. i suppose invocations are kind of costly? due to how awesome our signatures can get?

[09:42] <timotimo> or method calls or something.

[09:42] <moritz> due to parrot creating a GCable or two for every invocation

[09:43] <moritz> so allocations + GC

[09:43] <timotimo> so is that a thing we'd have to change parrot for or can we get around some of that overhead by tweaking nqp/rakudo?

[09:43] <moritz> I think parrot is hopeless here

[09:44] <moritz> timotimo: though iirc bigint allocation is also a bit slow

[09:44] <timotimo> okay. and moarvm is already doing better, yes?

[09:44] <moritz> timotimo: implementing a pool of allocated bigints might be helpful

[09:44] <timotimo> hm. so if a bigint is no longer in use we can re-use an old one? or how do you propose the pool to work?

[09:44] <timotimo> or are bigints immutable?

[09:45] <timotimo> yeah, they certainly are

[09:45] <moritz> well, under the hood they aren't

[09:45] <moritz> the mp_int construct

[09:46] <timotimo> would i have to teach parrot to move garbage collected mp_ints into a pool to be overwritten the next time a bigint is created?

[09:48] <moritz> maybe it can be solved at the NQP level somehow

[09:48] <moritz> iirc jnthn had some ideas

[09:48] <timotimo> it seems i'd have to interact closely with the GC on that

[09:48] <timotimo> ah. i wanted to come up with a benchmark to measure how much it's worth to skip known-length constructs after an "alt" regex.

[10:34] <jnthn> Hello, #perl6

[10:35] <moritz> good antenoon, jnthn 

[10:35] <timotimo> huh, do we never generate literal zerowidth nodes in qregex?

[10:36] <jnthn> timotimo: No, 'cus literal doesn' support zerowidth, iirc

[10:36] <timotimo> it's easy for it to do so, though

[10:36] <timotimo> at least the part in QAST/Compiler

[10:37] *** darutoko joined
[10:37] <FROGGS> hi jnthn 

[10:37] <timotimo> if there's any <?before 'foo'> in nqp's or rakudo's grammar, that could be turned from a subrule call into a simple inlined literal

[10:37] <timotimo> probably not worth much, though.

[10:40] <jnthn> True, they could.

[10:40] <jnthn> And making it work is "just" not adding

[10:40] <timotimo> the way i see it, it'd be enough to put a "unless $node.subtype eq 'zerowidth'" after the ... yes

[10:40] <jnthn> Be sure to support the negate case too if that ain't already done.

[10:41] <timotimo> negate is in there already

[10:41] <timotimo> negate zerowidth doesn't need additional work, right?

[10:41] <jnthn> It actually avoids a call to before *and* before calling the thunk...

[10:41] <jnthn> No, not if negate is in there already.

[10:41] <timotimo> good

[10:42] <jnthn> So long as you only do it for things that are precisely a literal I think you're fine.

[10:42] <jnthn> Though...

[10:43] <jnthn> r: 'i like food' ~~ /<?before foo> food/; say $/

[10:43] <camelia> rakudo-parrot 180fca, rakudo-jvm 180fca: OUTPUT«｢food｣␤␤»

[10:43] <jnthn> r: 'i like food' ~~ /<before foo> food/; say $/

[10:43] <camelia> rakudo-parrot 180fca, rakudo-jvm 180fca: OUTPUT«｢food｣␤ before => ｢｣␤␤»

[10:44] <jnthn> timotimo: Note ^^ difference. Make sure yo check that the before call is non-capturing.

[10:44] <jnthn> Need to look at .name iirc

[10:44] <timotimo> sounds good

[10:44] <jnthn> Just checking the before call is zerowidth won't but it because

[10:44] <jnthn> r: 'i like food' ~~ /<foo=?before foo> food/; say $/

[10:44] <camelia> rakudo-parrot 180fca: OUTPUT«｢food｣␤ foo => ｢｣␤ before => ｢｣␤␤»

[10:44] <camelia> ..rakudo-jvm 180fca: OUTPUT«｢food｣␤ before => ｢｣␤ foo => ｢｣␤␤»

[10:45] <jnthn> oh hmm :)

[10:46] <jnthn> bbi10

[10:48] <timotimo> there's actually a few befores in rakudo's grammar that could be sped up this way

[10:51] <timotimo> there's also a few mentions of <?before \S> for example, which could just become a zerowidth enumcharlist/en^H^Hcharrange

[10:51] <timotimo> but many before's have alt or altseq in them

[10:52] <timotimo> of course <?before \s | '#'> could just as well be turned into a zerowidth combined character class

[10:52] <timotimo> that'd be a bit more advanced and applicable less often

[10:53] <FROGGS> timotimo: it would if a # in <?[ ]> would work :/

[10:53] <timotimo> :)

[10:54] <timotimo> oh, $node.subtype could already be ignorecase for literal, that's probably why it doesn't have a zerowidth option

[10:54] <timotimo> so it could only be either of the two :(

[10:57] <timotimo> ah, moar already had code in place to support zerowidth literals

[10:58] *** brrt left
[11:08] <jnthn> \S is a cclass, not enumcharlist

[13:01] <timotimo> say, jnthn, couldn't i just in general wrap whatever's inside the <?before > into something like a concat that has zerowidth?

[13:01] <timotimo> i don't see why that wouldn't work for everything

[13:02] <jnthn> timotimo: concat really is very very simple

[13:02] *** FROGGS left
[13:02] <jnthn> timotimo: I mean, it doesn't make a mark or anything

[13:03] <timotimo> well, i just want something that can do zerowidth and contain other things, so maybe not concat specifically

[13:04] *** FROGGS joined
[13:07] <jnthn> timotimo: I'd not over-optimize the complicated cases

[13:08] <jnthn> timotimo: Anything that captures is gonna get icky fast

[13:08] <jnthn> timotimo: I'd just look for cases where <?before single_thing> where single_thing is easy to zero-width already, for the time being...

[13:08] <jnthn> timotimo: The more that happens inside the before, the less significant its overhead comes.

[13:10] *** denisboyun joined
[13:10] <timotimo> right.

[13:11] <timotimo> curiously, /^<?before foobar>/ generates a concat of a scan and a literal inside the before

[13:11] <timotimo> that can't be right?!

[13:11] <jnthn> timotimo: It's just that scan ends up in everything, I think...

[13:11] <timotimo> oh, hm.

[13:11] <jnthn> timotimo: It'll never actually scan 'cus from will never be -1

[13:12] <timotimo> should i throw it away if i do this specific optimisation?

[13:12] <jnthn> We could actually suppress generating that in the case we know we can never possibly scan.

[13:12] <jnthn> Yes, you can.

[13:12] <timotimo> thanks :)

[13:12] <jnthn> You'll have a pass to throw away too

[13:12] <timotimo> i do

[13:15] <timotimo> can i do the same thing if the name was "after"? because the qregex will be flipped so that it matches in reverse? or something like that?

[13:21] <timotimo> it kind of irks me that i can't combine subtype zerowidth with subtype ignorecase

[13:23] <jnthn> I'd leave "after" alone...

[13:23] <jnthn> It's uncommon and yeah, it's evil...

[13:23] <jnthn> The string has to be flipped as well as the regex.

[13:23] *** xenoterracide left
[13:25] <timotimo> well, i'll get the already-flipped qast where i'm at

[13:25] <timotimo> but i'll leave it alone for now.

[13:56] *** kaleem left
[14:01] *** tgt left
[14:02] <jnthn> timotimo: ah, yeah...you can't just toss those out of the tree as they will already have made it into the SC...

[14:03] <jnthn> timotimo: The Rakudo optimizer just empties them of content and adds a QAST::Op.new( :op('die'), QAST::SVal.new( :value('Optimized out code executed!') ) ) or so

[14:04] *** btyler joined
[14:05] *** kbaker_ joined
[14:05] <timotimo> ah, ok

[14:05] <timotimo> where do i throw it, then?

[14:06] <timotimo> can it become just an extra child for cclass, literal, enumcharrange, ... that won't be looked at by the actual QRegex compiler, but will still be compiled for the SC?

[14:07] <jnthn> I'd just throw it in the QAST::Stmts [0] of the surroudning block.

[14:07] <timotimo> hm, do i even have access to it where i am? :\

[14:08] <jnthn> I dunno, where are you?

[14:08] <jnthn> An optimizer really should know what block it's currently in... :)

[14:08] <jnthn> At worst you can shove it in a $*CUR_BLOCK when you are walking the tree...

[14:09] <timotimo> actually, i'm in the actions of p6regex

[14:09] <jnthn> I thought you were implementing optimizations?

[14:09] <timotimo> but the code could just as well live in the optimizer

[14:09] <jnthn> s/could just as well/should/

[14:09] <timotimo> that gives me another problem, though

[14:09] <timotimo> how do i re-use the optimizations in rakudo?

[14:10] <jnthn> Factor them into a QRegex::Optimizer class, and use that in both NQP's and Rakudo's optimizer, maybe.

[14:10] <timotimo> that sounds sane.

[14:11] <jnthn> Could go with a role, but I think simple delegation is saner in this case.

[14:12] <timotimo> probably is, yeah

[14:12] <timotimo> i thought the benefit of putting it in the actions is that i don't have to manually walk the whole tree to find the few instances where i can do my optimization

[14:12] *** jnap joined
[14:13] <timotimo> well, before i move it over, i want to get it to at least work :)

[14:13] <timotimo> so i'll do the current_block dynamic variable trick you told me about and see if i can get it to work, then i'll clean it up

[14:13] <jnthn> Well, but the optimizer already goes walking the tree.

[14:14] <timotimo> it doesn't descend into qregex i believe

[14:15] <jnthn> Right, it currently says "oh, regexes, I don't know how to optimize those" :)

[14:17] <timotimo> there's something called $*RX that seems to be helpful to my current subgoal

[14:18] <timotimo> oh. it's NQPMu at that particular moment >_>

[14:18] <jnthn> argh ffs I need to teach the folks who made WPF a class in API design and making the easy things easy or something :/

[14:19] <jnthn> uh, ww :)

[14:19] * jnthn has enough other things to rant about here without ranting about WPF here too... :)

[14:20] <timotimo> ah, i didn't look closely enough, it's actually %*RX and it just stores information, not the block i'm in

[14:20] <timotimo> i should move the code to the optimiser now.

[14:21] <timotimo> fwiw, i already have a regex optimizer stubbed in a different branch

[17:12] <timotimo> the "before" optimization doesn't save a noticable amount of time in stage parse of the setting unfortunately

[17:13] <timotimo> but currently i'm skipping negated befores and cclasses

[17:14] <timotimo> well, most of the befores had already been optimized to be call-less befores

[17:15] <timotimo> i'm thinking i should revert the changes from <?before '['> to <?[\[]> again, so that it'll be a literal check instead of a enumcharlist, because that should just get the ord and do an integer comparison

[17:16] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, or just make an enumcharlist of 1 char turn into a literal... :)

[17:16] <jnthn> As a more general opt.

[17:17] <timotimo> ah, sure

[17:20] <timotimo> would you be fine with that optimisation going into the Actions instead of the Optimizer?

[17:20] <timotimo> that's also where it decides to create charrange instead of enumcharlist.

[17:21] <jnthn> I think I'd prefer that one goes into the optimizer, so it can work on enumcharlists however they happen to come about...

[17:21] <timotimo> well, at that point i already know if there's just a single range, rather than multiples

[17:22] <timotimo> and don't have to go through the string and compare all the ords

[17:55] <FROGGS> does that capture at all? I thought not

[17:55] <timotimo> i may be able to make it capture and it'd break if i'm not careful enough in the optimization

[17:58] <FROGGS> timotimo: nqp-p passes here

[17:59] <timotimo> yes, it's my optimization causing trouble with parsing regexes apparently

[17:59] <FROGGS> btw, I tend to create diffs locally if I fiddle with it longer...

[18:00] <timotimo> i commit instead :)

[18:09] <timotimo> so it's a fiendish transformation, most likely

[18:09] <FROGGS> ok 491 - negated allows ws

[18:09] <FROGGS> not ok 492 - negated character range

[18:09] <FROGGS> not ok 493 - illegal character range# TODO reversed character range

[18:10] <timotimo> oh?

[18:10] <timotimo> could i have b0rked that?

[18:29] * [Coke] apparently does not have rights to update post-commit hooks on nqp & parrot. can someone who does remove the sends to #parrot ?

[18:30] <FROGGS> [Coke]: I'd think that these commit go to dalek and dalek itself must be tweaked

[18:31] <[Coke]> FROGGS: no, it's a post-commit hook on github.

[18:31] <FROGGS> I have no admin rights either though to actually check that

[18:34] <FROGGS> [Coke]: but the IRC hook is for one channel only

[18:34] <[Coke]> FROGGS: no, you can specify multiple channels.

[18:35] <[Coke]> the hook posts to dalek. dalek posts to IRC.

[18:35] <[Coke]> the hook that posts to dalek specifies any number of channel/server combos.

[18:35] <FROGGS> room - Supports single or multiple rooms (comma separated). Also supports room passwords (room_name::password). Prefixing '#' to the room is optional.

[18:35] <FROGGS> yeah

[18:35] <[Coke]> so github is the thing that needs changing.

[18:35] <FROGGS> jnthn: can you have a look?

[18:38] <Rotwang> hi

[18:39] <Rotwang> I'm trying to comprehend this code: https://github.com/grondilu/libdigest-perl6/blob/master/lib/Digest.pm

[18:39] <Rotwang> what is: my \foo ?

[18:40] *** jeff_s1 left
[18:40] *** jeff_s1 joined
[18:41] <FROGGS> Rotwang: a declaration of a sigil-less variable

[18:41] <[Coke]> sigil-less variable.

[18:41] <[Coke]> you can then use it later as a bare foo

[18:43] <Rotwang> cool, although it looks ugly

[18:43] <FROGGS> true :o)

[18:46] <TimToady> the alternative is to blow up if anybody ever defines a 'foo' type

[18:46] *** berekuk joined
[18:47] <TimToady> or come up with a less ugly method of saying "this isn't meant to be a type constraint"

[18:47] <FROGGS> the alternative is to use $foo

[18:47] <TimToady> no

[18:47] <TimToady> that itemizes

[18:47] <TimToady> \foo is just a bare parcel binding without itemization

[18:47] <FROGGS> ahh, it is not just about style?

[18:47] <TimToady> no

[18:48] <TimToady> it just happened that after we added it to signatures to do parcel binding, it works for 'my' too :)

[18:48] <FROGGS> well I have just the rosettacode examples in mind where you said that it would look more like a mathematical formula in the end

[18:48] <TimToady> we could, instead, add another declarator, I suppose, but we'd still need to have the \ in siggies, so it doesn't help that much

[18:48] <TimToady> or something to do what \ does

[18:49] <FROGGS> but yeah, I knew about its behaviour in signatures... just wasn't aware that it had that meaning in Digest.pm

[18:49] <TimToady> in fact, it doesn't exactly create a variable, just an alias

[18:49] <TimToady> r: my \foo = 42; foo = 43;

[18:49] <FROGGS> I don't think replacing \ by something else makes it better :o)

[18:49] <TimToady> as you see, foo doesn't vary :)

[18:50] <TimToady> it's our SSA form of assignment currently

[18:50] <FROGGS> mhm

[18:50] <japhb> TimToady, What is the linguistics term for languages like German that tend to build long compound words?

[18:50] * FROGGS .oO( my *FOO = 42 )

[18:50] <TimToady> hmm, agglutinative maybe?

[18:50] <japhb> .oO( It's linguistics, it can't be OT in #perl6 ... )

[18:51] <FROGGS> japhb: I like that btw, and I find split-up-words very disturbing

[18:51] <FROGGS> well, maybe not "very", but still

[18:52] <japhb> One's natal language's customs are comforting, I think.

[18:52] <FROGGS> possibly :o)

[18:52] <TimToady> well, it helps to have some standardish word endings so that the internals of the word tend to be self-clocking

[18:53] *** berekuk left
[18:53] <TimToady> the greeks had standard enough word endings that they didn't need word spacing at all, or didn't think they needed it :)

[18:54] <japhb> Wikipedia has an entire category tree for agglutinative languages.  19 sub-categories and 370 pages directly at the top level.

[18:54] <TimToady> in german most of your verbal prefixes would end -en

[18:55] <TimToady> .oO( sitzen Sie down und watchen die Blinkenlights )

[18:55] <FROGGS> hehe

[18:56] <jnthn> [Coke]: Remove the hooks for reporting of commits to nqp and *parrot*? Doesn't #parrot want to know about Parrot commits? Or did you mean NQP and Rakudo?

[18:56] <jnthn> [Coke]: Done the nqp one, anyways...

[18:57] <TimToady> my father used to quote: "Die Kuh hat über die fence gejumped, und hat der Cabbage verdamaged."

[18:57] <TimToady> er, Fence

[18:57] <FROGGS> ewww

[18:58] <FROGGS> that is bad Germish

[18:58] <arnsholt> TimToady: At least most people don't have to worry about rendering boustrophedon digitally =)

[18:58] *** SamuraiJack left
[18:58] <TimToady> well, mixed ltr and rtl languages are worse

[18:58] <arnsholt> I wouldn't call German agglutinative, though

[18:58] <TimToady> that's mostly used on verbs, if I recall

[18:59] <TimToady> eskimo and such

[18:59] <arnsholt> Compounding isn't orthogonal to agglutinativity, but at a bit of an angle

[18:59] <TimToady> well, you probably remember a lot more linguistics than I do :)

[18:59] <FROGGS> Klingon certainly is

[19:00] <arnsholt> I'd class German as more analytic than agglutinating, but with some variability in word order

[19:00] <TimToady> my `foo = 42;  

[19:00] <TimToady> that would be slightly prettier

[19:00] <FROGGS> true

[19:01] <TimToady> and only recognized in siggies

[19:01] <TimToady> so we're still kinda reserving ` for user, er, use

[19:01] <arnsholt> japhb: Oh, and English makes compound words quite frequently as well. It's just that they're mostly written with spaces in between, so they're not as obvious on the page

[19:01] <jnthn>  doesn't look better than \ to me :)

[19:01] <jnthn> uh

[19:01] <jnthn> `

[19:02] <jnthn> ...also my ` key is sticky, so don't change it :P

[19:03] <jnthn> FROGGS: Yeah, but working on my desktop at the moment

[19:03] <TimToady> y'know, new keyboards are really cheap these days

[19:03] <FROGGS> jnthn: well, keyboards tend to have a plug

[19:03] <FROGGS> TimToady: not the primus maximus or what it was called

[19:03] <jnthn> I didn't realize my ` key was icky until just now :) I don't type those too often... :)

[19:03] <FROGGS> about 1.800 €

[19:04] <TimToady> obviously you don't exercise it enough

[19:04] <FROGGS> usually a perler is used to `

[19:04] <TimToady> you don't have to reach for qx :P

[19:05] <FROGGS> that reminds me that qx is broken atm :/

[19:05] <FROGGS> (it does not pass %*ENV along)

[19:05] <[Coke]> jnthn: no, remove the rakudo & nqp notifications -to #parrot-. leave parrot/parrot notifications alone.

[19:06] <jnthn> [Coke]: Rigth, that's what I guessed you meant, but wanted to check :)

[19:06] <[Coke]> jnthn++ excellent guesser.

[21:34] <lue> FROGGS: is there no :abs adverb for &open or anything? also, you could try open( qx"$*VM<config><cc> -c -xc -", :w, :p ), seeing as you seem to be executing cc

[21:35] <lue> qqx rather

[21:35] <FROGGS> qqx just does an open, readall, close

[21:36] <FROGGS> and then returns the slurped output

[21:36] <FROGGS> I need to open cc as a pipe, to print to it C source

[21:38] *** labster joined
[21:39] <FROGGS> there is no :abs...

[21:54] <lue> FROGGS: the only other thing I can think of is to count the number of directories in CWD and prefix that many ../ to the string.

[21:54] <camelia> ..rakudo-jvm 180fca: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[21:55] <FROGGS> lue: and then I had a ../../../cc ? this would not find my cc either :o)

[21:55] <FROGGS> I just use the nqp:: ops now :/

[21:56] <FROGGS> japhb: yeah, I'll care about that when we have NativeCall there

[21:57] <japhb> FROGGS, Oh, I was just checking whether the cc defaulted to having paths of its own.

[21:57] <japhb> I wasn't (intentionally) pointing out the JVM difference.

[21:57] <FROGGS> ahh

[21:57] <lue> FROGGS: try "; $*VM<config><cc>" as the start of the string

[21:57] <FROGGS> well no, cc and friends usually come without path

[21:57] <japhb> lue:  >.<

[21:57] <FROGGS> gah

[21:58] <FROGGS> no :o)

[22:08] <lue> I don't see anything in S32::IO that requires a CWD prefix from open. If it is in fact supposed to happen, I'd like :abs/:rel adverbs, where :rel does the CWD prefixing and :abs doesn't.

[22:08] <lue> (maybe :rel would take a value, default to $*CWD)

[22:09] <lue> Ah, here it is in S16:  * When a IO::Path object is created, if the string it is given is not an

[22:09] <lue>    absolute path, then $*CWD is prepended to it.

[22:10] <FROGGS> :/

[22:11] <FROGGS> I'm not sure but I think the $*CWD only messes up when opening a pipe

[22:11] <FROGGS> so maybe this should be special-cased

[22:20] <lizmat> yeah, we just missed the ferry in Puttgarden and had to wait ~ 1 hour  :-(

[22:20] *** berekuk left
[22:20] <timotimo> so yeah, it seems like there's some overhead to calling a subrule and then a thunk in addition

[22:21] * timotimo runs the rakudo spectest suite to make sure nothing obvious is broken

[22:21] <timotimo> jnthn: do you think i can merge this into nom?

[22:21] <timotimo> the overhead of running the optimizer over regexes may not yet be worth the payoff

[22:22] <timotimo> except if you hit a pathological case like mine

[22:22] <timotimo> and literals are currently b0rked in a way that befuddles me

[22:23] *** Rotwang left
[22:24] <timotimo> (but the optimizer will not try to do that any more)

[22:24] <jnthn> timotimo: Hmm...not now, I think. Release very soon.

[22:24] <jnthn> timotimo: Maybe let's look at doing it after release...I can perhaps find a moment to review it too ;)

[22:24] <timotimo> that would be great :)

[22:25] *** btyler joined
[22:32] <timotimo> jnthn: do you think the analysis overhead makes up for the winnings of turning an alt or altseq of single-character literals into an enumcharlist?

[22:43] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, better question is, does that ever occur in real code?

[22:44] <jnthn> timotimo: Removing the scan from a regex whose first thing is a ^ is probably a more worthwhile optimization...

[22:45] <timotimo> huh, is that even going to give a speed improvement?

[22:45] <timotimo> i thought scan is going to immediately finish if its "from" isn't -1?

[22:48] *** berekuk joined
[22:48] <timotimo> t/spec/S05-modifier/perl5_5.rakudo.parrot  Failed tests:  5, 7, 9  - uh oh

[22:49] <jnthn> timotimo: Yeah, but it is -1 in /^foo/

[22:49] <timotimo> oh!

[22:50] <timotimo> so it'll scan across the whole source text, even though it's going to fail at every spot except the beginning?

[22:52] <jnthn> Yeah. It fails quickly (integer comparison) each time but it's still stupid to bother :)

[22:53] <timotimo> well, if you have a hundred thousand bytes to scan through, it may take a bit :P

[22:56] <timotimo> well, i'm glad there's lots of things to improve >_<

[23:03] <japhb> Was the 100_000 bug ever fixed?

[23:04] <japhb> Memory allocation histograms would probably be very revealing.

[23:05] <japhb> Cut off the long tail of that histogram, and I bet Rakudo gets a LOT happier.

[23:05] <japhb> Is there a way in jvm or parrot to produce such a histogram relatively easily?

[23:06] <timotimo> someone, i think it was hoelzro or dwarring, recently experimented with something on JVM

[23:07] <lizmat> jnthn: coming back to our concurrency / locking issues we talked about yesterday

[23:08] <timotimo> it led us to find out that the linepos cache was being regenerated for each and every BEGIN block, which caused a full re-scan of the source code about 130 times for the setting compilation

[23:08] <lizmat> pretty sure we need some way to either make sure array's are push/pop safe from different threads

[23:08] <lizmat> or we need to be able to mark them as safe

[23:08] <lizmat> otherwise, something as simple as registering a tap on a Supply might fail

[23:09] *** woolfy joined
[23:09] <jnthn> lizmat: I'm pretty sure I threw in appropriate locking to not have the issue in that case (on the basis that it's OK to use low level things when you're implementing the high level things)

[23:09] <lizmat> otoh, I now see that the push/pop in Supply are actually protected by a lock

[23:09] <lizmat> indeed

[23:10] <lizmat> ok, false alarm there  :-)

[23:10] *** dmol left
[23:10] <jnthn> The other one to consider is iterating, given we have laziness :)

[23:11] <japhb> timotimo, Was the 130x rescan bug fixed?

[23:11] <jnthn> That that comes into play with push too...

[23:11] <jnthn> japhb: I thougth it was but when I looked at the code doing it the other day I became a little less convinced it is, but I was very tired...

[23:12] <jnthn> (Stuff changed to address the issue, I just couldn't quite convince myself that the code actually *did* address the issue)

[23:12] <japhb> jnthn, understood.

[23:12] <japhb> That should be a relatively easy thing to check, should it not?

[23:13] *** berekuk left
[23:13] <jnthn> Think so

[23:13] <timotimo> japhb: yeah, the line pos cache was just passed on to Compiler.compile if it was available and it didn't have to rescan any more

[23:13] <japhb> (Meaning, it shouldn't be hard to instrument the rescan)

[23:13] <jnthn> Right.

[23:13] <timotimo> i'll do that right now.

[23:14] <japhb> timotimo, Thank you.

[23:14] <jnthn> timotimo: My concern was that I don't think we ever create a data structure to re-use.

[23:14] <jnthn> timotimo: That is, we never bind an empty thing to the otuermost line pos cache contextual.

[23:14] <japhb> Who are the JVM coders?  jnthn, arnsholt, who else?  I'm wondering if one of them knows how to get a memory alloc histogram out of it.

[23:15] <jnthn> Or if we do I couldn't see where.

[23:15] <japhb> Actually,

[23:15] * japhb searches online

[23:15] <jnthn> japhb: jvisualvm *may* do it...

[23:17] *** sivoais left
[23:17] <timotimo> jnthn: no need to put in an empty datastructure, because if it's not truthy, it'll be regenerated

[23:18] *** rurban1 left
[23:18] *** rurban1 joined
[23:19] <jnthn> timotimo: Yes, but if you don't, and you redeclare the contextual in the compile method, it will only store the computed thing in that contextual, *NOT* the outer one.

[23:19] <jnthn> as in, further down the callchain

[23:19] <jnthn> Where it could be re-used

[23:19] <timotimo> oh!

[23:19] <timotimo> yes, i see multiple rebuilds of the linepos array, actually.

[23:19] *** stevan_ joined
[23:19] <timotimo> i'll see if it's still in the 100s for the setting

[23:20] <timotimo> i thought it might be dangerous to just let an inner compile call leak into the outer dynamic variable because what if you call eval on some file or string?

[23:21] <timotimo> yeah, you were right

[23:22] <japhb> D'oh

[23:22] <timotimo> it's a good thing you notified the authorities, mister!

[23:23] <timotimo> jnthn: a suggestion for how to make passing the cache on safe? cache the WHICH of $target as well?

[23:24] <jnthn> timotimo: I think the trick is to look at definedness in method compile

[23:24] <timotimo> actually, it seems like in the setting we only build one linepos array

[23:24] <jnthn> timotimo: If you're passed something defined, bind it to the contextual

[23:25] <timotimo> but in bootstrap and metamodel, for example, we build multiple

[23:25] <jnthn> And not, then bind an empty nqp::list() there

[23:25] <jnthn> And in the thing that builds the cache, only create and bind a data structure iff it's not defined, and if it's defined but false, populate *that* empty data structure.

[23:25] <timotimo> where do i put the my $*LINEPOSCACHE then?

[23:26] <jnthn> Still in method compile

[23:26] <timotimo> ok

[23:26] *** sivoais joined
[23:26] <japhb> From a bit of searching, it looks like jmap and jhat are the first port of call when looking for aggregate heap info, standard since 1.6 JDK

[23:26] <diakopter> eh

[23:26] <jnthn> method compile(blah blah, :$lineposcache, blah) { my $*LINEPOSCACHE := nqp::defined($lineposcache) ?? $lineposcache !! nqp::list_i(); ... }

[23:27] <diakopter> japhb: jvisualvm is the tool

[23:27] <timotimo> yeah

[23:27] * japhb shrugs

[23:27] <japhb> <--- very not a Java person

[23:29] <jnthn> <--- not one either, just learned JVM instruction set, and indy :P

[23:29] <timotimo> i wonder if there's a trick to find a \r or \n very quickly in a whole 64 bit area with some fancy integer arithmetic or something

[23:32] <timotimo> huh. i still get multiple regenerations of the lineposcache

[23:32] <timotimo> 	    src/Perl6/Actions.nqp

[23:32] <timotimo> linepos cache regenerated in 4.71963596343994 seconds

[23:32] <timotimo> this is surprising

[23:32] <timotimo> given that the setting only takes 0.002s for the linepos cache

[23:33] <timotimo> it doesn't seem like your change changed much, or maybe i misimplemented it

[23:33] <timotimo> but in the setting it only gets called once and is surprisingly fast

[23:33] <timotimo> even in the metamodel where it gets regenerated like 20 times, it only takes 0.0002s each

[23:34] <timotimo> well, 0.0005s, but whatever.

[23:35] <timotimo> i'll go to bed now
