[00:22] <colomon> it's sort of cheating, because it gets there without having a bunch of things that are pretty essential for actual p6 coding.

[00:23] <colomon> whoops, lost context on that.... was commenting about how many tests were passing in rakudo-jvm

[00:23] *** SmokeMachine left
[00:23] <colomon> and was planning on following up by saying how awesome the progress was anywhere.

[00:23] <colomon> *anyway

[00:23] *** SmokeMachine joined
[00:24] * colomon may have to shut up before he says more silly things

[00:24] <sorear> huh.  if I'm reading JVMS §4.10.1.9 correctly, it's possible to catch an exception thrown by a constructor, and then *use the new half-initialized object anyway*

[00:25] <colomon> doesn't that defeat the purpose of throwing the exception?

[00:27] * colomon should really track down why his $work code is always output analytic curves, even when the flag says "Don't", before he starts playing more with Rakudo JVM

[00:28] <sorear> holomorphic curves?

[00:28] <colomon> no, simple 3d ones

[00:28] <colomon> well, up to NURBS

[00:29] *** abnorman left
[00:34] *** ecocode left
[00:37] <benabik> sorear: 4.10.1.9 seems to be instruction verification?  IS this mentioned under the new op?

[00:39] <sorear> benabik: no, under invokespecial

[00:40] <sorear> benabik: note that the unitnitialized(42)->java/whatever rewrite is done BOTH for the normal termination output frame, and the exception output frame

[00:42] *** Guest1337 left
[00:42] <benabik> sorear: It _seems_ like there's a flag to say it's not usable in that case: see the small print at the end of the op.

[00:44] <sorear> benabik: that only covers the case of calling a superclass/same class constructor from within a constructor

[00:44] <sorear> it doesn't cover the object construction case

[00:44] <sorear> new/dup/invokespecial

[00:45] <sorear> or rather, new/dup/astore/try{invokespecial}/catch{aload; mess around}/

[00:47] *** lelf` joined
[00:48] *** skids joined
[00:49] *** btyler joined
[00:50] * jnthn found enforcing the constructor call somewhat curious.

[00:50] <jnthn> At least invokespecial is non-virtual...

[00:50] *** lelf left
[00:50] <jnthn> So it's trivial to optimize away empty ones.

[00:50] <jnthn> (for the JVM)

[00:56] <sorear> I'd rather get rid of new and unininitialized types and just have invokespecial return the new object on the stack like a sane op

[00:58] <sorear> jnthn: well, apparently there were some classes that used constructors to enforce security checks...

[00:59] *** benabik left
[00:59] <sorear> jnthn: btw, I'm going to attempt to write a class splitter in O(days), so we have it before we need it

[01:01] <colomon> class splitter?

[01:01] <sorear> colomon: produce a .jar containing several class files

[01:02] <colomon> wouldn't that be a class joiner?

[01:02] <sorear> colomon: class files are limited to 65535 entries in the constant pool and the setting already uses more than half of those

[01:02] <colomon> oh

[01:02] <colomon> silly java

[01:04] <sorear> there's room for optimizing our constant table usage, but only to a point: each method must have a unique name*, which must be stored in the constant pool

[01:05] <sorear> * technically we can use overloading to bend the limit, but there's a separate limit of 65535 methods which makes that less useful

[01:06] <jnthn> sorear: Feel free, though there are probably more pressing things.

[01:06] <jnthn> But -Ofun :)

[01:06] <jnthn> sorear: If you want to figure out pipe form of open, that'd be a useful one.

[01:06] <jnthn> sorear: The tests that use Test::Util to call out to perl6 block on that.

[01:07] <jnthn> And you probably are cluefuller on that than I. :)

[03:06] <shinobicl_> hi

[03:08] <colomon> o/

[03:09] <shinobicl_> is anyone familiarized with AspectJ? 

[03:10] <colomon> not I

[03:10] <shinobicl_> ok, an example... lets say that i have 10 classes, objects that have a method "persist" that saves the object to the database

[03:11] <shinobicl_> and i want to add logging capabilities to each "persist" method

[03:12] <shinobicl_> i just program an "aspect" and then i wire the execution of each method "persist" to this logging aspect

[03:13] <shinobicl_> so aspectj detects when each "persist" method runs and can inspect the method, the object, the class, etc... using introspection

[03:13] <shinobicl_> you can even inject new methods and attributes (sorta like perl6 roles) to the objects

[03:15] <shinobicl_> and.. that is.  at least these are the parts that i've used of Aspectj

[03:16] <shinobicl_> the thing is, is a damn good idea. they call these problems like logging "cross cutting concerns". tipically janitorial tasks that your system must perform. With aspectj, you can take them "out of the way" of the design of system you are building.

[03:19] *** SamuraiJack joined
[03:20] <shinobicl_> i guess that is totally possible to implement in perl6, and in a much better way. aspectj has its own issues that makes you shoot you in the foot many times. 

[03:22] <moritz> iirc jnthn implemented some aspect-oriented programming in one of his talks on the MOP

[03:24] <sorear> colomon: find the relevant line in src/vm/jvm/QAST/Compiler.nqp and add a :tc adverb

[03:24] <colomon> sorear: thanks!

[03:24] <JimmyZ> shinobicl_: http://jnthn.net/papers/2012-gpw-meta-programming.pdf

[03:26] <shinobicl_> thanks JimmyZ. Already reading it. Grammar:Tracer, right?

[03:26] <colomon> sorear: rand_I's randomness looks a little dodgy to me?

[03:27] <JimmyZ> shinobicl_: nope, next that

[03:28] <colomon> sorear: making good progress towards srand, I think

[03:28] <colomon> sorear: probably go to bed first, though.

[03:29] *** daniel-s_ left
[03:31] <colomon> nothing like learning Java programming while working on a compiler written in it...  ;)

[03:32] *** daniel-s_ joined
[03:34] <sorear> I hear it's even better to learn a language by writing a bootstrapped compiler.

[03:34] <sorear> will look at rand_I

[03:37] <sorear> Stefans-MacBook-Air:rakudo-jvm sorear$ ./perl6 -e '{ my %h; %h{$_}++ for (^5).roll(1000); say %h }'

[03:37] <sorear> ("3" => 128, "2" => 242, "1" => 260, "0" => 237, "4" => 133).hash

[03:37] <sorear> Stefans-MacBook-Air:rakudo-jvm sorear$ ./perl6 -e '{ my %h; %h{$_}++ for (^5).roll(10000); say %h }'

[03:37] <sorear> ===SORRY!===

[03:38] <sorear> java.lang.StackOverflowError

[03:38] <colomon> yup, not that random

[03:39] <sorear> the first test is inconclusive, the second is *clearly wrong*

[03:40] <colomon> do you understand why the stack overflow?

[03:40] <sorear> Stefans-MacBook-Air:rakudo-jvm sorear$ ./perl6 -e 'my @h; my int $i; while $i < 100000 { @h[nqp::rand_I(5, Int)]++; $i = $i+1; }; say @h'

[03:40] <sorear> 24875 25063 24986 12539 12537

[03:40] <sorear> colomon: no, I don't

[03:41] <sorear> rand_I would be good enough if the bitLength() were changed to bitLength() + 32

[03:41] <colomon> I guess I can fix rand_I the same way we (I?) did it in Niecza -- just keep on rand-ing till we get a number that matches the constraints.

[03:42] <sorear> would still not be uniform exactly, but the statistical difference would be small enough that you'd need to run an expirment for millions of years to detect thje difference

[03:42] <colomon> unless you have a better suggestion

[03:42] <colomon> next question: why is srand returning a value in parrakudo?

[03:42] <sorear> ...or use rejection sampling, that works too

[03:43] <sorear> because it predates Nil?

[03:48] <colomon> yeah, that sort of makes sense

[03:49] * sorear thinks that the best RNG for many applications on current CPUs is AES-CTR

[03:51] <colomon> java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.perl6.nqp.runtime.Ops.srand(J)J

[03:51] <colomon> what's that (J)J mean?

[03:52] <colomon> "The point of the function is to "seed" the rand function so that rand can produce a different sequence each time you run your program. When called with a parameter, srand uses that for the seed; otherwise it (semi-)randomly chooses a seed. In either case, starting with Perl 5.14, it returns the seed. " 

[03:52] <sorear> takes one argument of type long, returns a long

[03:53] <colomon> should be taking two args, long and ThreadContext

[03:53] <sorear> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3

[03:53] <colomon> QAST::OperationsJAST.map_classlib_core_op('srand', $TYPE_OPS, 'srand', [$RT_INT], $RT_INT, :tc);

[03:53] *** daniel-s_ left
[03:53] <sorear> that only applies to newly-compiled code

[03:53] *** preflex_ joined
[03:53] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v preflex_

[03:53] <colomon> sorear: eh?

[03:53] <sorear> you often have to keep old versions of ops around for the benefit of src/vm/jvm/stage0/*.class

[03:54] <colomon> oh

[03:54] <sorear> I've taken to marking things /*FOR_STAGE0*/ when that's the only reason they stick around

[03:54] <sorear> btw, that link convers method descriptor interpretation

[03:55] <colomon> ah, srand used to be in the QAST thing without an actual implementation

[03:55] *** preflex left
[03:55] <sorear> so you'll be able to make sense of (JLorg/perl6/nqp/runtime/ThreadContext;)J or whatever else gets thrown at you

[03:55] <sorear> oh

[03:55] *** preflex_ is now known as preflex

[03:55] <colomon> sorear++

[03:55] <sorear> ...did you recompile?

[03:55] <colomon> ...yes

[03:57] <colomon> should I not have?  or do I need to do something more?

[03:59] <sorear> do you get the srand error when trying to compile code that uses srand?

[04:01] <sorear> with that map_classlib_core_op you posted, if it's saved and compiled, nqp ought to be generating code which looks for (long,ThreadContext)

[04:01] <sorear> not (long)

[04:03] <colomon> I got that trying to run code that uses srand

[04:04] <colomon> (after my normal recompile)

[04:04] <colomon> (normal recompile: in nqp, make install; in rakudo-jvm, perl ConfigureJVM.pl and then make)

[04:05] * colomon is probably doing something stupid because he is too tired to program

[04:07] <colomon> errr... rebuilt everything the exact same way as I thought I did it before, and now it all works.

[04:08] <colomon> I have a working srand here; I'll check it over and commit it once I've had some sleep.

[04:08] <colomon> thanks, sorear++

[04:14] * [Coke] categorizes the java aborts: https://gist.github.com/coke/5879701

[04:15] <sorear> [Coke]: did you see my test_summary patch earlier today?

[04:19] <[Coke]> to bin/rakudo.jvm.sh -? already applied it. Thanks!

[04:22] <[Coke]> definitely a huge improvement!

[04:22] <sorear> [Coke]: no, the later one

[04:23] <sorear> [Coke]: I modified test-summary to be able to process rakudo_test_run.tar.gz files generated by the spectest harness

[04:23] <[Coke]> the "shell" stuff jnthn mentioned is blocking 165 tests.

[04:24] <sorear> [Coke]: so it's now possible to do TEST_JOBS=4 make rakudo_test_run.tar.gz; t/spec/test_summary rakudo.jvm --archive rakudo_test_run.tar.gz

[04:24] <[Coke]> sorear: does it change the default behavior or take an option for that? (checking)

[04:24] *** xilo left

[07:46] <sorear> \d\d? would work better

[08:58] <lizmat> good *, #perl6!

[08:59] <moritz> \o *

[08:59] <lizmat> wrt http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-06-28#i_7266026 : the meta information in pod is only used to *select* a compunit, it is *not* needed during compilation

[09:00] <lizmat> so it *will* be possible to trivially skip pod parsing as a speed tweak

[09:00] <lizmat> meta information  in pod is of course also needed when installing a compunit

[09:03] *** xinming left
[09:03] *** domidumont left
[09:04] *** domidumont joined
[09:04] <FROGGS_> depending on the implementation it might be needed only when installing

[09:04] *** xinming joined
[09:09] <lizmat> oops, yes, that's actually what I meant: the meta-information from pod is somehow stored in a database on installation, and *that* is used to select the compunit

[09:09] <lizmat> FROGGS++ for pointing out the ambiguity of my not yet awake brane

[09:10] <FROGGS_> I really like that pod section... we just need to convince TimToady++ a bit more :o)

[09:10] <moritz> I thought pod blocks are accessible at run time?

[09:10] <FROGGS_> moritz: they are

[09:11] <FROGGS_> but you dont *have to* care what is in this particular one when you have located the unit-file

[09:11] <FROGGS_> you can, of course

[09:11] <moritz> what is "the unit-file"?

[09:11] <FROGGS_> Foo.pm

[09:11] <FROGGS_> (because module has more than one meaning)

[09:12] <moritz> is this about speed-parsing to find whether a given file contains the module we're looking for?

[09:12] <FROGGS_> yes and no

[09:12] <FROGGS_> if we implement it right we wont parse every module file and then sort them out by the pod blocks

[09:13] *** xinming left
[09:13] <FROGGS_> when should have built a database when installing a module

[09:15] *** xinming joined
[09:19] <lizmat> and actually, that part of the code I have already written more or less

[09:19] * moritz is still lost, but that's OK

[09:19] <FROGGS_> moritz: np, we take you with us :o)

[09:20] <lizmat> currently, the CompUnitRepo module's interface is TBD

[09:20] <lizmat> but I think it will have an "install" method

[09:20] *** FROGGS[mobile] left
[09:21] <lizmat> and a "find" method

[09:21] * sorear is doing a thing

[09:21] <lizmat> the "install" method will take a string, parse its contents for pod meta-info, and then put the string somewhere

[09:22] <sorear> i've hacked the test harness to make a log of which blocks are used while executing which test files

[09:22] <moritz> "install" and "find" sound like they should go into diffrent classes

[09:22] <sorear> my hope is that we'll find that 90% of the test files use 10% of the setting

[09:23] <sorear> and then maybe we can do some cool demand loading thing to improve cold start performance

[09:23] <lizmat> while recording the meta-information in some for somewhere if needed (this is not true for the proposed CompUnitRepo::Local::File)

[09:23] <moritz> (unless 'install' is "add to repo")

[09:23] <lizmat> install is add to repo

[09:24] <lizmat> please note, this does not do any dependency checking or whatever

[09:24] <lizmat> this is the final step of installing a compunit in a repo

[09:25] <lizmat> and that repo can be just a directory/subdirectory, for development situation, just like @*INC now works

[09:25] <lizmat> and then the filesystem just needs to be able to support the quirks of the compunit naming it gets thrown at it

[09:26] <lizmat> (which would be the CompUnitRepo::Local::File class doing the installing)

[09:27] <lizmat> or it could be something more elaborate that would do filename mangling and store meta-information in some kind of database (probably just some text file)

[09:28] <lizmat> which would be CompUnitRepo::Local::Installation in my proposal

[09:28] <lizmat> or anybody could make a different module with the same API

[09:28] <lizmat> using a SQLite database backend for storing compunits and their meta-information

[09:29] <lizmat> or even one that doesn't actually install, but fetches files from the cloud at runtime and *then* store them locally

[09:29] <lizmat> or whatever, it is intended to be flexible

[09:32] <FROGGS_> sorear: what do you mean by "blocks"?

[09:32] <FROGGS_> code sections of the compiler or the script?

[09:33] <FROGGS_> because knowing dead sections of the compiler code is a pretty cool thing

[09:33] <sorear> FROGGS_: I'm recording all of them, but I only care about the compiler and setting ones

[09:33] <FROGGS_> that is pretty awesome

[09:34] <FROGGS_> because if an else block will never be used there is potentially a thinko/bug... but I guess you already know that :P

[09:35] <sorear> I hadn't even considered the test coverage angle

[09:35] <sorear> My main objective here is to cut down on the 6 second startup time by allowing rarely used parts of the compiler and CORE.setting to be demand-loaded

[10:10] <jnthn> sorear: Did CodeRef get changed yet to not resolve all of it's annotations until first usage?

[10:11] * jnthn remembers thinking of doing that, but didn't actually get to it himself... :)

[10:12] <jnthn> BTW, friendly reminder to those going to YAPC::EU: tomorrow is last YAPC::EU talk submission day. :)

[10:13] <jnthn> And I don't see that many Perl 6 submissions :P

[10:16] <sorear> jnthn: we can't even create a coderef until we have an annotation, because that's how we distinguish coderefs from other blocks

[10:17] <sorear> jnthn: i've been toying with the idea of resurrecting getCodeRefs, possibly in a different form

[10:18] <sorear> also then I can kick the non-hot blocks out of the core class and demand-load them

[10:18] <jnthn> sorear: Yes, we have to get the annotation itself, but not all of the various fields out of it.

[10:18] <jnthn> sorear: This is assuming the individual values carry some cost to create/are built on-demand...dunno if htat's acutlaly the case.

[10:18] <sorear> jnthn: I don't think that makes a difference

[10:19] <sorear> jnthn: the generated methods for the annotation don't even show up on the profile, while getAnnotation does and fairly high

[10:19] <sorear> so I think it's doing all the work upfront

[12:45] <jnthn> oops, wrong window!

[12:45] <moritz> there are more incriminating links you can accidentally post into the wrong window :-)

[12:45] <jnthn> yes! ;)

[12:58] <FROGGS[mobile]> Hehe

[13:12] *** Chillance joined
[13:16] *** tomyan joined
[13:16] <timotimo> so, to implement dir(), the parrot backend gets the full list of contents and then lazily iterates over them in nqp code; can i easily do such a lazy iteration in java code, or should i add a jvm-specific nqp::dircontents and implement the filtering and lazyness in the dir method instead?

[13:18] <jnthn> Well, if you expose it as opendir/readdir/closedir nqp ops then I guess you can get some laziness

[13:18] <jnthn> But I'm not sure it's worth it

[13:18] <jnthn> Maybe for really huge directory listings it would be...

[13:19] *** benabik left
[13:20] * jnthn looks through the [Coke]++ list of Java aborts

[13:20] <timotimo> so, am i allowed to make up a new nqp op name, even if it isn't available on parrot? or perhaps i could mimic the op on parrot because it already non-lazily gets all the dirs, too ...

[13:21] <FROGGS> jnthn: I have dirs at work that have several thousands of files...

[13:22] <FROGGS> and it would be nice if it wouldnt takes several seconds to get the content as it is now using p5

[13:22] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, you could add an nqp:: op for it, map it on Parrot to what it currently does, then implement it for JVM also, then have the same code in Rakudo...

[13:23] <jnthn> timotimo: But FROGGS makes a good point.

[13:23] <jnthn> We have an opportunity to do it righter than p5, it sounds.

[13:24] <FROGGS> yeah, for example if you want to get the first file that matches a pattern, then you dont need the full list

[13:24] <timotimo> hm, not sure how i have to handle the encoding; on parrot it does pir::trans_encoding__Ssi($filename, find_encoding__Is('utf8')) do i have to do something in particular on the jvm to get that same behavior out?

[13:24] <timotimo> okay, i can use the DirectoryStream<Path> thing from java; i could create such an object with nqp::opendir, destroy it in nqp::closedir and iterate one entry with nqp::nextdir or something

[13:25] <timotimo> but where do i keep the actual DirectoryStream instance?

[13:25] *** benabik joined
[13:25] <jnthn> timotimo: We already have an IOHandle REPR, potentially you can use that and stash a DirectoryStream in it too...

[13:26] * timotimo looks

[13:27] <jnthn> A whole load of these fails pertain to a fiddly BS issue...

[13:27] <jnthn> I guess I should work on that...

[13:28] * jnthn makes a cuppa while pondering the fix...

[13:30] <FROGGS> hmmm, tea is a nice idea (bad weather here)

[13:31] <moritz> what's BS?

[13:31] * jnthn could settle for a little cooler, even :)

[13:31] <jnthn> moritz: Bounded Serialization

[13:32] <moritz> ah right

[13:32] <FROGGS> ohh, |= is a trap!

[13:33] <FROGGS> (in case you have +> and +& next to it)

[13:33] <jnthn> r: my $a = 1; $a |= 2; say $a.perl

[13:33] <camelia> rakudo bbc2b3: OUTPUT«any(1, 2)␤»

[13:33] <jnthn> :)

[13:33] <FROGGS> yeah, but that was not what I wanted

[13:33] <jnthn> I can't think of any particularly practical uses for making a junction that way, but I'm sure there will be one some day :)

[13:35] <FROGGS> well, pushing things this way to a junction can be useful I imagine

[13:35] <FROGGS> but I have to get into it first... I'm still a P5 hacker using P6

[13:36] <jnthn> :)

[13:36] <jnthn> Yeah, I tend to experience the opposite now: I'm a P6 hacker who sometimes uses P5 and has to think about it a bit :)

[13:37] <colomon> same here.  :)

[13:37] <FROGGS> .tell masak I am working on v5's pack/unpack right now, we obviously need the intsize there too... I am thinking of providing %Config<intsize>, which defaults to 4, and can be overridden by setting %Config and by the precision argument to sprintf

[13:37] <yoleaux> FROGGS: I'll pass your message to masak.

[13:37] <timotimo> jnthn: did you mean for me to add a new field for a DirectoryStream to the IOHandleInstance class? do i have to do a magic dance for nqp to work with the resulting new repr?

[13:38] <FROGGS> .tell masak I'm not sure if this can be passed to the "i" (un)pack token somehow

[13:38] <yoleaux> FROGGS: I'll pass your message to masak.

[13:39] *** FROGGS_ left
[13:45] <jnthn> timotimo: No magic dance, I shoudln't think :)

[13:46] <timotimo> OK

[13:52] <timotimo> how should i signal "the end of the directory has been reached" from nextfiledir if i decided to return a String from it? (also, should i call it *_s in that case?)

[13:53] <timotimo> oh, String can be null.

[13:54] *** tomyan left
[13:54] <jnthn> that works, yes

[13:55] <timotimo> DirectoryStream has no explicit close thingie, so setting ioh.dirstrm = null should suffice to get it closed, yes?

[13:55] <timotimo> oh, nope, it inherits closable.

[13:55] <jnthn> Suspect it wants an explicit close...

[13:56] <timotimo> indeed, and i've done that now :)

[13:57] <timotimo> er, but how do i make sure that the directory stream gets closed if i have dir be lazy? i can't know if the iterator was thrown away, can i?

[13:58] <jnthn> Hmm

[13:58] <jnthn> That is the downside of laziness. The handle won't get freed until the object is collected.

[13:58] <jnthn> And the finalizer runs.

[13:59] <timotimo> should i write a TODO in the ops file and be done with it for now?

[13:59] <jnthn> If somebody iterates all the way then it'll hit the end and know to close, I guess.

[13:59] <jnthn> It's just if they stop in the middle.

[13:59] <timotimo> yes

[13:59] <timotimo> should i make nqp::nextfiledir close the stream when the iterator hits the end?

[14:00] <timotimo> probably not, if nqp::closedir is its own op

[14:00] <jnthn> No, just make sure that when that returns a null then the calling code uses closedir, I think.

[14:01] <timotimo> if i my Str $foo := nqp::nextfiledir and the java function returns null, how do i check it in nqp code? is there something like nqp::isdefined?

[14:03] <jnthn> nqp::isnull

[14:03] <jnthn> or nqp::isnull_s for strings

[14:04] *** snoopy left
[14:05] <timotimo> thanks!

[14:07] <timotimo> what's mapperspeak for "returns void"?

[14:11] <colomon> IO actually appears to be not as broken as I thought?  But lines() fails hard

[14:12] <jnthn> .oO( fail hard with a vengence )

[14:13] <colomon> just not fail harder, okay?

[14:14] * colomon did not like Die Hard 2.  :\

[14:16] <timotimo> which one was that?

[14:16] <mst> timotimo: the one colomon doesn't like.

[14:17] <colomon> timotimo: the one set at an airport

[14:18] <timotimo> oh, i remember sitting in the theater and noticing a colomon in the back getting up and leaving now that you mention it

[14:18] <benabik> Die Hard was a good movie.

[14:18] <colomon> it felt like they were lazily trying to just clone what worked with the first movie without having a clue about what actually worked, if that makes any sense.

[14:18] <timotimo> the first one was the one in the skyscraper, yes?

[14:18] <benabik> Shame they never made sequels.

[14:19] * timotimo is still bummed out about the first three star wars movies never being made

[14:19] <colomon> timotimo: yes, first one was skyscraper

[14:20] <timotimo> ConfigureJVM.pl needs a --gen-jvm for all the people who don't have jvms installed on their machines! :P

[14:21] <benabik> timotimo: Should we add --gen-gcc to Rakudo?

[14:22] <timotimo> sounds like a good idea

[14:22] <timotimo> i hear there's a new upcoming C compiler called "clang" that's gaining popularity fast

[14:22] <timotimo> maybe we should add an option for that somehow

[14:24] <colomon> Another good project: add --make-movie-better to ffmpeg...

[14:25] <timotimo> java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0 -  oooh, how did i do that?

[14:25] <colomon> I've gotten that several times in things that didn't involve arrays this week.  :\

[14:26] <timotimo> how do i pinpoint the problem?

[14:26] <timotimo> it happens after the jast stage, fwiw

[14:27] <timotimo> i guess i should first make sure that my changes are at fault

[14:27] <colomon> oo, that's happening when you're building?  ugh

[14:27] <colomon> *building rakudo

[14:27] <jnthn> Wait, did you use an RT_VOID return type for an op? And it's not in sink context?

[14:28] <jnthn> Or not not last thing in a block at least...

[14:28] <jnthn> That's asking for trouble. Pretty much all the ops leave *soemthing* on the stack just in case.

[14:28] <timotimo> oh, interesting

[14:29] <colomon> hmmm, we're getting NullPointerException here: (my $line = self.get).defined

[14:29] <timotimo> it's not the last thing in a block

[14:29] <colomon> I think the time it's not defined.

[14:29] <timotimo> should i return a long instead?

[14:30] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, typically one of the arguments is a good thing to return...a null SMO can also be OK

[14:30] <jnthn> long is fine too

[14:30] <timotimo> i'll do that then. for now i put the closedir in sink context.

[14:30] <timotimo> just to see if it compiles and passes any tests at all

[14:49] <timotimo> is a dirty hack acceptable that will just ~ "/" ~? :P

[14:49] <timotimo> well, for testing purposes at least.

[14:56] <timotimo> blergh, can't self.directory ~ "/" ~ $elem, because self.directory delegates to self.parts which uses IO::Spec, too 

[14:58] <jnthn> I'm currently working on what I think is the issue beneath some of IO::Spec's brokenness

[15:24] <jnthn> timotimo: Well, I just discovered it may be nothing to do with the thing I'm working on and everything to do with IO::Spec being missing from the makefile on JVM :)

[15:24] <jnthn> Currently seeing if it will build.

[15:26] <masak> thundergnat: interesting. yes, let me have a look at the gist and I'll get back to you.

[15:26] <yoleaux> 00:11Z <BenGoldberg> masak: Considering that the perl6 channel is utf8 friendly, why not use Mäsak as your irc nickname?

[15:26] <yoleaux> 13:37Z <FROGGS> masak: I am working on v5's pack/unpack right now, we obviously need the intsize there too... I am thinking of providing %Config<intsize>, which defaults to 4, and can be overridden by setting %Config and by the precision argument to sprintf

[15:26] <yoleaux> 13:37Z <FROGGS> masak: I'm not sure if this can be passed to the "i" (un)pack token somehow

[15:28] <masak> does Perl 5 have anything like %Config<intsize> ?

[16:13] <TimToady> it's a little sad that ."foo"() and ::("foo") are so different, but I don't think we can make those consistent, since .() is taken, and ::"foo" is close to unreadable

[16:14] * mst likes $obj->${"foo_${bar}"} in p5 :)

[16:19] <masak> "hard refs" meaning "there's an actual routine (reference) in that variable", I guess.

[16:19] <masak> I'm unused to thinking about those as "hard refs" in Perl 6. :)

[16:20] <masak> TimToady: so... then, it's an LTA error? can we require that it be a Routine or something like that? or is the postcircumfix:<( )> error the best we can do?

[16:29] <masak> I wish we would use roles more for requiring stuff. like Callable actually requiring a postcircumfix:<( )>. and then we'd say that $foo in 42.$foo has to be a Callable.

[16:30] <masak> of course, you could still provide postcircumfix:<( )> outside of Callable... but then you couldn't do 42.$foo

[16:30] <masak> hm, and postcircumfixes are being turned from methods to subs... :/

[21:16] <nwc10> I have not looked at what *benchmarks* it uses. The graphs that are published are (if I remember correctly) are for a build of perl 5 using the default -O2 compiler flags for gcc, and I believe for a single run

[21:19] <nwc10> yes, my frustration is how it is used for the published graphs

[21:20] <nwc10> I've not looked at the benchmarks themselves

[21:27] <nwc10> but I have recently found that crazy things that make no sense to me measurably and repeatably affect performance

[21:27] <nwc10> such as the link ordering of object files. Object files in which everything is L1 cache aligned

[21:33] <pmurias> http://pastie.org/8095338

[21:34] <nwc10> pmurias: pair of stupid questions - (1) that's the JVM segfaulting? (2) is it the most recent version available?

[21:35] <pmurias> it's the jvm, not make

[21:39] <lizmat> TimToady: wrt http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-06-29#i_7268923 : I'm not sure what you call the compiler here

[21:40] <lizmat> The classes providing the CompUnitRepo interface, store the meta-information of compunits

[21:41] <pmurias> nwc10: I'll try with the latest jdk from oracle

[21:41] <lizmat> whenever a compunit needs to loaded, it will give this from/longname/auth/ver to each of the CompUnitRepo objects in @*INC

[21:42] <lizmat> They then use whatever they need to return which compunist match in their repo

[21:43] <nwc10> I seem to be building NQP fine (and tests passing) with:

[21:43] <nwc10> java version "1.7.0_25"

[21:43] <nwc10> OpenJDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.3.10.3.el6_4-x86_64)

[21:43] <nwc10> OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)

[21:44] <lizmat> the repo also returns the meta-info of the candidates, which the compiler can use to set up introspection if the candidate is selected for loading

[21:45] <lizmat> so the compiler *will* know all of the meta-information of a compunit when needed

[21:45] <raiph> lizmat: i'm guessing larry's confusion is the same as FROGGS (http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-06-29#i_7267798)

[21:45] *** spider-mario left
[21:45] <lizmat> but not before then (unless you call the "database" that a CompUnitRepo has, knowledge of the compiler)

[21:46] <labster> r: my $str = "foo A bar"; $str ~~ s { 'A' }  = 'B'; say $str;

[21:46] <camelia> rakudo b7bbd6: OUTPUT«foo  bar␤»

[21:46] <labster> rakudobug

[21:46] <lizmat> raiph: indeed  :-(

[21:47] <lizmat> so: to recap:

[21:47] <raiph> lizmat++ # right combination of skills, branepower, diplomacy, patience, impatience

[21:47] <lizmat> *blush*

[21:48] <lizmat> 1. whenever a -use- is done in code, the CompUnitRepo-like objects in @*INC each get a chance to say whether they know of any matching candidate compunits

[21:49] <lizmat> 2. the compiler makes a choice out of these candidates, if needed, or throws an exception if nothing found or can't make a decision

[21:50] <lizmat> 3. when a compunit is selected, its meta-information (already provided to the compiler when making a choice) is installed as introspection info after the compunit is loaded

[21:53] <lizmat> 4. Rakudo will provide 2 implementations of CompUnitRepo: CompUnitRepo::Local::File (basically, the current behaviour) and CompUnitRepo::Local::Installation, which has a simple database, basically consisting of dump of a hash representation of the meta-information of installed modules, easily allowing smart-match logic on them

[21:54] <labster> .oO (CompUnitRepo::Remote::CPAN -- store your modules in the cloud)

[21:57] * FROGGS .oO( CompUnitRepo::Local::DevNull -- install your modules to ... )

[21:57] <lizmat> labster: I would see that as an on-demand installation feature

[21:58] <lizmat> FROGGS: I would see that as a way to make files appear to be *not* installed

[21:58] <FROGGS> :o)

[21:59] <sorear> ::CPAN could be cool

[21:59] <lizmat> FWIW, I think each CompUnitRepo should be able to say that no further searching is needed

[21:59] *** Rotwang left
[21:59] <FROGGS> hmmm, not sure if I could agree

[22:00] *** ecocode left
[22:00] <lizmat> if you don't allow that, you will get modules that start fiddling with @*INC to get the same behaviour

[22:01] <FROGGS> yeah, maybe you are right

[22:02] <FROGGS> if a repo says "hey, I've got a dev module here that should get picked no matter what" than this is the right playce to say so

[22:02] <lizmat> indeed

[22:02] <FROGGS> -y

[22:02] <FROGGS> k

[22:03] <lizmat> BTW, some commit today broke spectest quite seriously

[22:03] <FROGGS> O.o

[22:03] <lizmat> all tests failing in t/spec/S05-metasyntax/delimiters.t

[22:03] <FROGGS> sounds like an nqp patch

[22:04] <lizmat> 6 tests in t/spec/S05-modifier/counted

[22:04] <lizmat> 10 tests in t/spec/S05-modifier/ii.t

[22:05] <lizmat> 24 tests in t/spec/S05-modifier/perl5_0.t

[22:05] <raiph> lizmat: your design wouldn't preclude making all of CPAN plus local stuff appear to be installed, right?

[22:05] <lizmat> and a lot of io-spec and io-path tests

[22:05] <FROGGS> this could explain labster++ 's bug: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/412307989be6df484710ac7d46bb72d003649594

[22:05] <raiph> (or some arbitrary subset of CPAN)

[22:06] <lizmat> raiph: indeed, that's the idea

[22:06] <lizmat> even to the point that it may not install local copies, e.g. in small systems like a Raspberry Pi or so
