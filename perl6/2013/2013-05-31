[02:05] <pmichaud> I'm currently about 700km  (ahem, we use *miles* here, so 435 mi) north of you.

[02:06] <lizmat> well, that's more than we drove today… 

[02:06] <pmichaud> oh, wait.

[02:06] <lizmat> if you'd be in Amsterdam, we'd be in mid France

[02:06] <pmichaud> that's round-trip distance.

[02:06] <pmichaud> 350km  (217 mi)

[02:07] <lizmat> ah. that's more like: if we would be at home, you would be in Groningen…  about the max distance you can do in the Netherlands  :-)

[02:07] <pmichaud> right.

[02:07] <pmichaud> if you go due south, then in about 325 miles you finally hit the Mexico border.

[02:08] <pmichaud> lesson:  Everything's Big in Texas.  :)

[02:08] <pmichaud> anyway, glad you arrived safely.

[02:08] <pmichaud> I look forward to seeing you this weekend.

[02:09] *** gdey joined
[02:09] <colomon> I'll get there Saturday around dinner time, I think.

[02:09] <pmichaud> I don't know exactly when I'll arrive on Saturday, I'd like to get an early start, but I have to make sure everything is well-set at home before departing.

[02:10] <pmichaud> I think I'll try to arrive by 8pm or so, which is when I think jnthn/masak/others will likely be arriving.

[02:10] <lizmat> looking forward to that!

[02:10] <pmichaud> I might not be able to get there until midnight, though.

[02:11] *** grondilu left
[02:11] <pmichaud> I'll /msg folks my cell # so you can call and find out where I'm at.

[02:11] <pmichaud> or maybe I'll find a way to send my current location via twitter or a location app or something.

[02:13] * pmichaud checks weather

[02:13] <lizmat> ~34±1

[02:13] <pmichaud> yeah

[02:14] <pmichaud> looks like the forecast got warmer since I last looked

[02:14] <pmichaud> but Texas weather is very unpredictable.

[02:14] <pmichaud> as of two days ago, we were forecast for a sunny weekend, now we're forecast for rain+storms on the weekend

[03:02] <shachaf> Remember "Remember the Alamo!"!

[03:03] <pmichaud> don't worry about it too much; I had a girlfriend from Sacramento who was visiting San Antonio with me, and she saw a sign with directions to "The Alamo" and asked... "oh, is there a plaque or something there?"  :-P

[03:05] <pmichaud> (note to non-Texans:  It's a Spanish Mission with a chapel (the iconic building) and tours.

[04:39] <sorear> 1. R* uses stable parrots

[04:40] <sorear> 2. we've had a lot of issues with an IO refactor that parrot did, and for a while (possibly extending to now?) we weren't able to upgrade

[04:44] <atroxaper> I just thought that https://github.com/rakudo/star/commit/1631f371f2d3818d35850fdc20669d92ce3a1223 make R* is used 5.3 Parrot. Am i wrong?

[08:15] <moritz> you just have to be careful which memory you limit (hint: ulimit -v is most often what you want)

[08:16] <bonsaikitten> ulimit -m  256000 # 256 metric Mibblibytes

[12:10] <masak> wow, https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COT4810-Fall%202012/Literature/Backus.pdf is a really interesting observation, considering that it comes all the way from 1978.

[12:10] <masak> much of what it points out as disadvantages is still very much "unsolved".

[12:10] <masak> well, unless you're a full-time Haskell programmer. but most of us aren't.

[12:12] <masak> there are some silver linings even in the industry: things like LINQ, and Rx, and various non-mainstream languages (Scala, CLojure, F#) nibbling away at how to do things nicely with FP.

[12:24] <mathw> hybrid languages are where it's going to be for a good while I think

[12:25] <mathw> there are some astonishingly powerful ideas floating around in the Haskell world these days, but I'm not convinced Haskell itself is the right language to bring those wonderful things to the world at large with

[12:25] <mathw> I hope to see Microsoft do more with F#, the level of tooling in Visual Studio for it really relegates it to a second-class citizen

[12:26] *** eternaleye left
[12:26] <mathw> They don't bother providing tools for things like ASP.NET MVC projects in F# because their position is that it's not meant for that kind of work. Why, I ask, can't it be?

[12:26] <mathw> It does support all the necessary behaviours after all

[12:26] <masak> *nod*

[12:26] <mathw> It's still cheating, but it's closer...

[12:27] <mathw> I must admit to really missing Haskell typeclasses though

[12:27] <mathw> wonderful, wonderful things

[12:27] <mathw> It's like if C# let you add an interface implementation to an object without having the ability to modify its class

[12:27] <mathw> and yes there are extension methods, but they're not the same either

[12:28] <mathw> I want... roles!

[12:28] <masak> Go seems to do something similar-ish with its interfaces.

[12:28] <masak> it's an idea whose time has come.

[12:29] <masak> inheritance hierarchies are so 20th century. :)

[12:30] *** eternaleye joined

[12:31] <mathw> definitely

[12:31] <mathw> I use inheritance less and less

[12:31] <mathw> heck, I use objects less and less

[12:31] <mathw> my C# code is now strewn with static classes

[12:32] <mathw> objects have their place, but so much can be done with other ways and it seems to work better

[12:32] <mathw> if I have to make an instance of some object in order to do something like a data transform I tend to start turning my nose up

[12:32] <mathw> and plotting to write a wrapper function that hides the mess

[12:36] <mathw> probably the thing that distresses me most in C# programming is where you're in the shiny new world of LINQ and pseudo-functional programming and you run headlong into a library you can't avoid that's designed like something from Java 1.2

[15:08] <Ulti> yeah thats not really what I mean, its not parsing anything you've just made some method calls that look like the language you wanted and its executed as perl6 immediately

[15:10] *** FROGGS[mobile] joined
[15:11] <Ulti> like if you defined a custom string with a sub language tied to a grammar that parsed the _ and O to create a tree of execution for all that it would be what I mean.. obviously over kill for that task

[15:11] <Ulti> I assume thats how regex is implemented in perl6?

[17:49] <[Coke]> once it's at a point it can run *any* spec tests, I'll probably add it to the roast figures.

[17:49] <pmichaud> R* wants stability more than anything else, and it's not just the compiler but the modules that would want some working out.

[17:50] <[Coke]> then you can get a pretty picture of what happens when you add some bit.

[17:50] <pmichaud> we'll likely spend a good part of midsummer figuring out what modules R* really ought to have.

[20:40] <moritz> multi sub

[20:40] <TimToady> well, subscripts can be more complicated than that, but essentially yes

[20:40] <moritz> but yes, that's the general idea

[20:40] <supernovus> the biggest difference I guess being that it can no longer access private variables...

[20:41] <TimToady> it's likely to be a primitive that can access anything it jolly well pleases

[20:41] <jnthn> supernovus: at_pos and at_key are typically better things to override

[20:41] <jnthn> (They stay as methods.)

[20:41] <TimToady> subscripting is an important optimization target

[20:41] <jnthn> Yeah.

[20:42] <TimToady> and having it as methods tends to work against that

[20:42] <supernovus> Hmm, well, XML's tests still all pass, so I'm guessing this change hasn't happened quite yet?

[20:42] <jnthn> I mean, if postcircumfix:<[ ]> is a sub, the inliner can inline it.

[20:42] <jnthn> supernovus: No, it's upcoming.

[20:43] <jnthn> supernovus: I'll see if there can be a decent migration path.

[20:43] <supernovus> I'll try changing XML to use at_pos and at_key and see what happens.

[20:43] <TimToady> and for known types, especially compact arrays, it can do much more

[20:43] <jnthn> Right.

[20:43] <jnthn> It was when I was thinking about compact arrays that I hit upon wanting this change.

[20:44] <diakopter> sorear: as long as you don't critique my code in moarvm, I won't run away crying. we all know a C novice's code is going to not be superb. ;)

[20:46] <supernovus> Yay, changing to at_pos and at_key worked great. Simpler to remember method names too :-)

[20:48] *** SmokeMachine joined
[20:50] <supernovus> Is there an underlying method for postcircumfix:<( )> ?

[20:52] *** donaldh joined
[20:53] <moritz> no

[20:53] <supernovus> Is it changing to a sub too? I have at least one library that uses it.

[20:54] <moritz> I don't think so, at least not for now

[20:54] <tadzik> ehh, my nqp now reliably segfaults

[20:54] <moritz> invocation is tricky

[20:56] <jnthn> tadzik: try nuking any ModuleLoader.pbc in your Parrot install

[20:56] <tadzik> I think I have my parrot install nuked :) will re-check
