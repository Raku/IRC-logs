[06:07] <sorear> diakopter: i see.

[06:08] <sorear> 1. I'm trying to establish what is being done before and after that I might want to be present for / that others want me to be present for

[06:17] <diakopter> sometimes free books, equipment

[06:17] <sorear> I was not clear.  I am enquiring about the job fair on behalf of my current employer.

[06:17] <TimToady> [Coke]: as far as I can see through my clouded branes, an our sub oughta be okay just about anywhere, insofar as it's just a global really.  I wouldn't necessarily expect it to instantiate $?CLASS when composed though.

[06:20] <[Coke]> TimToady++

[06:20] <sorear> I'm not on that list

[06:20] <[Coke]> I will attempt to integrate that into some kind of ticket resolution.

[06:20] <diakopter> sorear: however, the job fair room is kinda full now.. yet another thing that's missing info on the site - cutoff date for getting in the job fair and getting your logo on everyone's t-shirt

[06:21] <diakopter> I'm not sure what that date is, but I'm guessing "next week"

[06:21] <sorear> (it's possible that someone else at $employer is on the list)

[06:23] <sorear> oh, huh

[06:23] <sorear> should I give up now re. job fair tables?

[06:23] <diakopter> yet another thing that's missing from the page with the register link

[06:24] <TimToady> [Coke]: on the other hand, I could argue that everything inside a role doesn't really exist until instantiate as a class

[06:24] <TimToady> including another role

[06:24] <diakopter> sorear: give up? no.. 

[06:25] <sorear> if not, who should I talk to?

[06:25] <diakopter> I'll answer you there :P  kidding, half. toddr or apeiron or others can answer too

[06:26] <diakopter> to send the $200, just go to http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/purchase and type 200 in the donation box

[06:26] <sorear> you may notice I'm already on.

[06:50] <TimToady> "useless use of | in sink context"

[06:54] <TimToady> we haven't had junctional types in Perl 6 for most of the last 10 years

[06:54] <[Coke]> ticket's from 2009

[06:54] <TimToady> so someone was remembering the old days

[06:55] <TimToady> junctional types were deemed to be impossible to understand, and a general public nuisance

[06:55] <TimToady> on top of which, we stole the syntax

[06:56] <TimToady> since signatures can contain | or & that don't mean junctions now

[06:57] <TimToady> so I can pretty safely say that you'll never just be able to throw A&B or A|B in where were currently parse a single type

[06:59] <TimToady> I'd just close that one as Not a Bug

[07:01] <[Coke]> oops. TimToady++

[07:02] <TimToady> maybe I'm getting better...

[11:45] <moritz> FROGGS: yes, in p5 subroutine lookup must be delayed (unless it can be found at compile time)

[11:49] <FROGGS> so I basically have to move these checks from Grammar to an QAST::Op.new( :op('call'), :name('CHECK_ROUTINE') ) or something like that

[11:50] <FROGGS> and this one will croak if &routine is not found in $*PACKAGE.HOW

[11:51] <FROGGS> hmmm, doesn't sound impossible

[11:55] <moritz> well, there's another slight gotcha

[11:55] <moritz> perl 5 only has our-scoped subs

[11:55] <FROGGS> well, that is good actually, no?

[11:56] <moritz> so maybe the most intuitive approach is to look for a lexical &yoursub first, in case it was provided by an outer Perl 6 scope

[11:56] <FROGGS> hmmm, true

[11:56] <moritz> and if that's the case, you emit a normal QAST::Op.new(:call, QAST::Var.new( :name<&yoursub>, :scope<lexical> )

[11:57] <FROGGS> right

[11:57] <FROGGS> same like variables

[11:57] <moritz> and if not , instead of the inner QAST::Var, you have a function that looks up the function in the symbol table at run time, and dies if it fails

[11:58] <FROGGS> right, sounds good to me

[13:36] <tadzik> panda can't do that yet

[13:37] <grondilu> ok

[13:37] <tadzik> but I want it to be able to do that :)

[13:37] <grondilu> GC?

[13:38] <tadzik> garbage collection

[13:38] <grondilu> k

[13:38] <tadzik> panda knows if it has installed a module as a dependency or not

[13:38] <tadzik> so later it'd be able to remove all dependencies which are not referenced by anything

[13:38] <grondilu> well, even cpan doesn't provide with any command to remove a module, so I understand it's probably tough to implement

[13:39] <BinGOs> cpanp does.

[13:39] <tadzik> it's not that hard I think

[13:39] <tadzik> panda just needs some packlist-like thing

[13:40] <BinGOs> we're going to be moving away from packlists so please don't implement that broken idea.

[13:40] <tadzik> ok :)

[13:40] <tadzik> I was mostly looking for inspiration in linux package managers

[13:41] <tadzik> some of them just keep one big file with mappings between module names and paths on the FS

[13:42] <BinGOs> the main problem is that once a distribution (ie. a collection of modules) has been installed there is a disconnect between the modules and the distribution they came in.

[16:25] <TimToady> hoelzro: the main problem with targetting Perl 5 is that the (lack of a) type system actively fights you, and if you bypass all the built-in allomorphic types to do everything in P5-ish OO, it's slow, and when you start trying to emulate laziness and sane regex, it's even slower

[16:26] <hoelzro> I see

[16:26] <TimToady> also, consider that STD/viv, which *does* in fact target Perl 5, turns 6320 lines of Perl 6 into 66290 lines of Perl 5...

[16:27] *** guru joined
[16:27] <GlitchMr> Perl 5 is already slow. Perl 6 running on Perl 5 would be even slower.

[16:28] <TimToady> much of the pugs effort was for targetting Perl 5 (it's even on the T-shirt), and it's one of the reasons pugs didn't go as far as we hoped

[16:29] <GlitchMr> Then again, Inline::Perl6 already exists.

[16:30] <GlitchMr> It's called Inline::Pugs and Inline::Rakudo.

[16:31] <TimToady> another data point was when we backported some p6 features such as switch into p5, and discovered they really didn't make a lot of sense without p6's type system

[16:31] <spider-mario> maybe Inline::Perl6 could exist and be to Inline::{Pugs, Rakudo} as YAML::Any is to YAML::{XS, Tiny, etc.}

[16:33] <TimToady> in a nutshell, P6 allows its users to be confused about its type system, but P5 allows itself to be confused about its type system

[16:40] <spider-mario> another problem with switch (more specifically `given`) in p5 is p5’s handling of lexical $_

[16:45] <nwc10> "lo"?

[16:46] <nwc10> is this a RTFM question yet? :-) I take it that NQP doesn't have BEGIN blocks. Correct?

[16:46] <jnthn> nwc10: It does but very constrained.

[16:46] <jnthn> nwc10: The BOOTSTRAP is actually mostly a huge BEGIN block.

[16:46] <nwc10> constrained that the BEGIN block isn't allowed to have side effects outside of the VM?

[16:46] <jnthn> nwc10: It pieces together the object system using MOP calls in a BEGIN block, whacks all it did in EXPORT, and then leaves the serializer to save its work :)

[16:47] <jnthn> nwc10: More that it has very limited visibility of the outer scopes.

[16:47] <TimToady> darn it, someone drank all my coffee again!

[17:11] * TimToady wonders if it would be useful or confusing (or both) to allow a-b to parse as a - b when both a and b are declared but a-b isn't...

[17:13] <nwc10> I think that it would be confusing, if only because you then wouldn't be able to look at that line of code and know what it did

[17:13] <TimToady> nr: say (state $)++ xx 4

[17:13] <camelia> rakudo bfd850, niecza v24-49-gfa3b5ca: OUTPUT«0 1 2 3␤»

[17:13] <TimToady> grondilu: is that what you were looking for?

[17:14] <TimToady> nwc10: but in context, it's usually quite obvious, because such programs are also full of a-1, a+b, etc

[17:14] <colomon> TimToady: (re a-b being a - b) Just say no.

[17:14] <colomon> rn: say (for 1..10 { $_ if .is-prime; }).perl

[17:14] <camelia> niecza v24-49-gfa3b5ca: OUTPUT«(Empty, 2, 3, Empty, 5, Empty, 7, Empty, Empty, Empty).list␤»

[17:14] <camelia> ..rakudo bfd850: OUTPUT«(2, 3, 5, 7).list␤»

[17:15] <colomon> TimToady: is Niecza in some sense right here, or should Nil go away before it can be seen in this sort of case?

[17:15] * colomon still trying to figure out how to fix niecza.

[17:15] *** mtk joined
[17:16] <TimToady> well, I don't think .perl should force list context, but maybe a list comprehension should do so automatically

[17:17] <TimToady> Empty is supposed to just mean ()

[17:17] <TimToady> basically, it's the old definition of Nil

[17:17] <grondilu> TimToady: I just wanted to see if niecza would give the same result as rakudo

[17:18] <TimToady> and Nil itself isn't quite de-listified yet either

[17:18] <TimToady> nodnod

[17:18] <TimToady> n: say (for 1..10 { .is-prime ?? $_ !! Nil }).perl

[17:18] <camelia> niecza v24-49-gfa3b5ca: OUTPUT«(2, 3, 5, 7).list␤»

[17:19] <TimToady> I don't know what's removing Nil there

[17:19] <colomon> Oh!  so if "if" returned Nil instead of Empty, it would work?

[17:20] <TimToady> well, yes, that's what it used to return, but spec is now that it returns () in that case

[17:20] <TimToady> because we want Nil to represent the most minimal kind of failure, without disappearing like () in lists

[17:21] <colomon> ....

[17:21] <nwc10> TimToady: it might work if there was an option to swtich the grammar between either "a-b is a() - b()" or "a-b is a-b()", and so the other interpretation is disallowed within that lexical scope.

[17:21] <TimToady> so that Nil can be one of the distinguished values that indicate success/failure to smartmatching

[17:21] <colomon> TimToady: so it should return () (or maybe Empty if that's the same thing) but () / Empty should disappear and Nil shouldn't?

[17:22] <TimToady> right, so it's a bit backwards there for some reason

[17:22] <colomon> like niecza has the empty / nil thing backwards... yes

[17:23] <TimToady> the problem I ran into was that the regex engine uses Nil internally to indicate "no more cursors", and it needs to be changed to use () or Empty

[17:29] <TimToady> nwc10: I see it more as a longest-token thing, recognize a-b as a single token if it can, otherwise recognize it as 3, with the onus on the programmer to install whitespace if a-b is ambiguous (which it almost never is)

[17:38] *** berekuk left
[17:38] <TimToady> a-b is just one of the thorny issues with the sigilless style, of course; all the "choose your own quote" keywords get in the way as well

[17:38] <TimToady> which RC entries mostly solve by using Unicode, but that's kind of ignoring the problem

[17:39] * colomon is not fond of sigilless style

[17:39] *** SamuraiJack__ joined
[17:39] <TimToady> it's much better looking for math stuff, I think

[17:39] *** PerlJam joined
[17:40] *** bakedb joined
[17:40] <TimToady> but simply telling the mathfolk that they can't use m or s or q as variable names is a bit antisocial, if there's some way to do the right thing for them

[17:41] <colomon> TimToady: it's maybe a bit better looking for math stuff ... but it's also ignoring all the reasons sigils are great.

[17:41] *** berekuk joined
[17:41] <TimToady> so we should force that on everyone, eh?

[17:41] <lizmat> hello #perl6!

[17:41] <lizmat> r: sub not-so { False }; say not-so()

[17:42] <camelia> rakudo bfd850: OUTPUT«True␤»

[17:42] <lizmat> and we need to fix these issues with "-"as well  :-)

[17:42] <colomon> TimToady: I'm sorely tempted to say yes.

[17:44] <timotimo_> r: say so();

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo bfd850: OUTPUT«False␤»

[17:44] <TimToady> some of this is also symptomatic of bifurcating the processing of identifiers into keyword tokens vs user-defined identifiers with different scoping rules

[17:44] <colomon> I like more than one way to do it; but then I don't like making the parser and language more complicated to allow something I'm guessing most style guides are going to end up telling you never to use.

[17:45] <moritz> it's a bit weird to have a sigil-ful language support sigilless style

[17:45] <moritz> after all we have *reasons* to use sigils

[17:45] <moritz> and then not using them after all is a bit like admitting we are/were wrong all the time :-)

[17:45] <TimToady> it's also the reason that drives a large portion of the population away screaming in horror

[17:46] <TimToady> I'd rather have a story that says, "Yes you can, but here are the tradeoffs: if you define \m, you can't say m//"

[17:46] <colomon> TimToady: yes, but is letting them skip the sigils when all the texts, documentation, and standard libraries use sigils really going to make them happy?

[17:46] <TimToady> if you define \s, you can't say s///

[17:47] <moritz> but providing an option for sigilless style isn't going to attract that part of the population, because they know that when they read other people's code, they'll see sigils and want to run away screaming in horror again

[17:47] *** domidumont left
[17:47] <moritz> you really can't have it both ways *and* sanity

[17:47] <TimToady> well, but that's always the case, even with sigils

[17:48] <TimToady> most people run away screaming from most people's code most of the time anyway

[17:48] <colomon> moritz and I mean run away screaming from the language itself

[17:49] <raiph> there is rationale for noun/verb markers; rationale for using symbols, including as markers; but depends on coder and domain

[17:49] *** woolfy1 joined
[17:50] <raiph> and a coders' point on the learning curve

[17:50] <timotimo_> since the GPN is fast approaching (end of this month), i don't think i can actually hold a proper talk; maybe i'll come up with a lightning talk instead.

[17:51] <timotimo_> for instance, at the congress one of the hacker jeopardy topics was "perl operators" (including eskimo kiss, spaceship, goatse, ...) so maybe i'll point out how perl6 operators and such are a bit nicer? (due to enforced spacing sometimes and due to other things at other times?)

[17:51] <nwc10> moritz: it depends. It may well (a) attract enough of the the NIH crowd to be useful (b) may well be enough to get some of the doubters to try (c) might get people started who then change their mind (d) it is a marketing tickybox. And sadly those matter, even if no-one uses the feature

[17:51] <nwc10> but yes, it has a cost in complexity and sanity

[17:51] <nwc10> trade off. :-(

[17:51] *** pmurias joined
[17:52] <nwc10> the NIH crowd being the ones who roll their own CGI parameter parsing etc, and copy-paste it into each new project

[17:53] <TimToady> well, the real insanity is that we have single letter keywords that are fighting with the mathematician's need for simple variable names

[17:53] <TimToady> if this can be dealt with sanely by invoking LTM and predeclaration, why not?

[17:53] <colomon> like i

[17:54] <TimToady> we already have those concepts, it would just be tweaking the application slightly when people actually declare \m thingies

[17:54] <nwc10> TimToady: oh, you're specifically meaning one character variables when you're talking about a-b

[17:54] <nwc10> not the general case of longer variables?

[17:54] <TimToady> can argue it both ways, but I'd prefer not to make an exception

[17:54] <nwc10> or I'm missing the point that the crunch will likely be on the single letters?

[17:55] <colomon> what about the case of $a-b where \b has been declared?

[17:55] <TimToady> the point is that keywords fight for namespace, and they currently fight a bit unfairly

[17:55] <TimToady> colomon: it would only try that if $a-b wasn't declared

[17:56] <TimToady> right now identifiers can only take an all-or-nothing approach under LTM

[17:57] *** sjn joined
[17:57] *** preflex joined
[17:58] <TimToady> under the rules I'm conjecturing, it might Just Work nearly all the time, and still catch 99% of typos

[18:00] <TimToady> it's probably something we should just prototype and try out for a while to see if it causes difficulties

[18:01] <nwc10> yes, that does feel like a good way forwards

[18:02] <TimToady> and let me be clear: my difficulty here is not actually the a-b issue, or math notation, but the fundamental extensibility of a language with a slightly insane keyword policy, which is what we have at the moment

[19:27] <jnthn> Well, that's one way to discover the appartment's smoke alarm still works...

[19:27] <TimToady> hopefully that's one of the better ways

[19:27] *** sivoais left
[19:27] <gfldex> moritz: that would be for irclog.perlgeek.de?

[19:28] <moritz> gfldex: correct, and sources at https://github.com/moritz/ilbot

[19:28] <jnthn> Decided to have a crack at doing onion bahjis. The results were OK for a first attempt, but apparently the frying passed the magical smoke threshold... :)

[19:28] *** sivoais joined
[19:28] <nwc10> jnthn: oh, they do smoke alarms in Sweden? Austria appears not to have heard of them.

[19:29] <jnthn> nwc10: Yeah, and I never set mine off while cooking before.

[19:29] * nwc10 has :-)

[19:29] <nwc10> usually with a frying pan

[19:29] <jnthn> yeah...that was it :)

[19:29] <jnthn> Hm, my appartment smells like an Indian restaurant now... :)

[19:30] <nwc10> is that a bug or a feature?

[19:30] <jnthn> Well, the food that produced it was certainly a feature... :)

[19:31] <TimToady> being anti-smoke is too left-wing for places like Austria :)

[19:31] <moritz> ... assuming you can still eat it, and don't have to phone the fire department first :-)

[19:33] <moritz> speaking of IRC logs -- is anybody using the text view?

[19:33] <diakopter> there's a text view?

[19:33] <moritz> I dimly recall that I added it some time ago for somebody who's mobile phone couldn't handle the full HTML

[19:33] <diakopter> that'd be cool for other bots/sites to parse

[19:33] <moritz> diakopter: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/text.pl?channel=perl6;date=2013-05-11

[19:34] <moritz> diakopter: JSON would be much cooler for that :-)

[19:34] <diakopter> text.pl needs a charset/encoding header

[19:35] <moritz> anyway, mobile phones have advanced quite a bit in the last years

[19:35] <moritz> and since I'm refactoring the whole thing, I would like to remove unused features

[19:35] <diakopter> your site still breaks on built-in safari on iphone for long pages

[19:35] <diakopter> like, freezes & crashes safari

[19:36] <diakopter> but iphone chrome handles it fine

[19:36] *** sivoais left
[19:36] <moritz> diakopter: submit bug report (for iphone safari) :-)

[19:36] *** sivoais joined
[19:36] <tadzik> moritz: I do sometimes

[19:36] <moritz> ok, then I'll keep it

[19:37] <diakopter> I'll use it now that I know about it

[19:37] <tadzik> I'm sometimes using it on a mobile when I'm crazy about data usage

[19:37] <diakopter> would download lots more quickly

[19:37] <diakopter> on mobile when on slow networks

[19:38] <diakopter> moritz: feature request (which I'm happy to do if you approve): auto-extending updates to the page with ajaxy thingies

[19:38] <diakopter> reloading on iphone every 30 seconds or so is really annoying

[19:38] <moritz> diakopter: you mean on the "today" page?

[19:38] <diakopter> yup

[19:39] <diakopter> when my ssh app isn't working or I want to be able to click links on the log on mobile, I use chrome/html

[19:39] <moritz> diakopter: I approve (but only in the branch 'nextgen', or after that branch has landed)

[19:39] <diakopter> and it takes 5-10s to reload usually

[19:39] <diakopter> on long pages

[19:40] <moritz> you'll like that branch better anyway, it offers deployment via Plack

[19:40] <moritz> so you just says 'plackup ilbot.psgi', and have a local dev server

[19:41] <diakopter> (note: by happy to do it, I mean in several weeks. ;)

[19:41] <diakopter> so feel free to beat me to it if you're bored :D

[19:41] <moritz> after the refactoring I'll tackle the transition to postgres

[19:41] <moritz> and some other stuff

[19:41] <moritz> so, not very likely

[19:42] <moritz> but I'll open a TODO ticket anyway

[19:42] *** rindolf left
[19:42] <diakopter> does the outputted page on 'today' ever change except for what's added?

[19:43] <moritz> well, summary stuff changes

[19:44] <moritz> but that can be ignored for 'today', IMHO

[19:44] *** sivoais left
[19:44] *** sivoais joined
[19:45] <diakopter> I'd simply use the webirc thing in chrome, except it doesn't create hyperlinks and such

[19:45] <diakopter> last I checked

[19:46] <moritz> ok, one more question

[19:47] <moritz> currently text.pl actually produces HTML, with a <pre> tag and then text inside

[19:47] <moritz> should it stay that way, or produce proper text/plain?

[19:49] <nwc10> proper text/plain would be lower bandwidth, wouldn't it, as nothing would need escaping?

[19:49] <nwc10> fractionally lower

[19:49] <moritz> sure, but back in the days[tm] some mobile phone browsers then offered it for download, instead of displaying it

[19:49] <nwc10> aha.

[19:50] <moritz> I'm all for text/plain myself

[19:50] <moritz> and I don't own a mobile phone that is connected to the internez, so I don't care either way :-)

[19:50] <diakopter> I say text/plain is fine, just test a few until you get the optimum charset/encoding header(s)

[19:51] <diakopter> er, coordinate with others to test ;)

[20:06] <diakopter> seems cool to me. I can link to it from camelia.org.. (for whatever that's worth.. ;()

[21:09] <tadzik> I have ideas? :)

[21:09] <colomon> TimToady: it looks to me like the problem is Niecza compiles itself using the "boot" version.  But the boot version hasn't been updated since the last time sorear did it.  Since you added "Empty", it boot version doesn't know about it.

[21:09] <colomon> TimToady: I don't know how to fix that, but at least I know where to look for clues now.  :)

[21:09] <jnthn> tadzik: lizmat suspects some dead code in docs related stuff

[21:09] <lizmat> well, maybe, I don't think so anymore

[21:09] <jnthn> :)

[22:56] <FROGGS> '.' on unix is not a command or program either, it is just the case that cwd is not considered when executing commands, so you have to supply the path to an executable to run it

[22:56] *** cxreg joined

[23:02] <jnthn> Oh, this is just parsing it

[23:02] <jnthn> Doesn't mean we get beyond parsing :)

[23:02] <FROGGS> ahh, okay

[23:03] <jnthn> What'll happen after this is we hit all the places the setting does pir::, Q:PIR and so forth.

[23:03] <jnthn> Drawn out, I suspect

[23:04] <jnthn> Thank heavens I ported the multi-dispatcher to NQP already, so that Just Works...

[23:55] <sneilan> hi, there are humans that use perl? perl is amazing & i've just discovered it after using python for years. I hope that people still use it.

[23:56] <sneilan> python has gotten soooo boring.

[23:56] <TimToady> no humans here, we're all subhuman :)

[23:56] <sneilan> robots?

[23:56] <TimToady> that would be telling

[23:56] <FROGGS> I sometimes feel that perl is using me :o)
