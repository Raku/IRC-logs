[00:24] * [Coke] stares blankly at the remaining opcodes.

[00:25] <diakopter> what are they

[00:26] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/6799633

[00:26] *** FROGGS joined
[00:27] <diakopter> I don't understand these

[00:27] <[Coke]> the opcodes, or the way in which they are presented?

[00:27] <diakopter> the last section means there are ops that are documented that don't exist in moar?

[00:27] <[Coke]> diakopter: yes

[00:27] <[Coke]> or my code isn't finding where they are defined.

[00:28] <[Coke]> and I've only documented ops that exist somewhere. (usually nqp-jvm)

[00:28] <diakopter> jnthn: so all I need to do is implement the bottom section of [Coke]'s gist? :)

[00:29] *** ivanshmakov left
[00:29] <[Coke]> no. that's doesn't count things that aren't documented. :)

[00:29] <[Coke]> they'll probably help, though, sure.

[00:30] <jnthn> diakopter: we'll need msot of those, yeah

[00:32] *** benabik left
[00:32] *** FROGGS left
[00:33] <[Coke]> if someone groks the lex opcodes, this would be a great list to write up some ops for. If someone gets me the basics, I can format it all properly.

[00:33] <[Coke]> https://gist.github.com/coke/6944137

[00:38] <jnthn> what, you mean the names aren't, like, totally logical? :D

[00:38] *** ivanshmakov joined
[00:38] <diakopter> they're completely descriptive.

[00:38] <jnthn> [get|bind]lex[_\w]? are all just normal lexical lookup

[00:38] <jnthn> bindlexdyn/getlexdyn just walk the caller chain

[00:39] <jnthn> getlexcaller walks the caller chain but at each step walks the lexicals from that frame's point of view

[00:39] <jnthn> getlexouter is normal lexical lookup but skips the current frame

[00:39] <jnthn> getlexrel* do lexical/dynamic/caller lookup relative to the specified ctx

[00:40] <jnthn> lexotic is something else altogether

[00:40] <jnthn> It's used to implement return

[00:48] <[Coke]> danke

[00:48] <[Coke]> I'll see if I can convert that into docs.

[02:16] <ammoun> e stands for expression right?

[02:16] <diakopter> <- kinda dull; ignore me

[02:16] <geekosaur> it stands for eval

[02:17] <geekosaur> you should ask in #perl. expect them to want to see more than 2 lines of your script (please use the paste site from the /topic)

[12:08] <masak> quiet today, huh_

[12:08] <masak> ?

[12:08] <jnthn> shhh!

[12:09] <nwc10> good day to write a FAQbot? :-)

[12:10] *** Bzek left
[12:16] <masak> heh.

[12:17] <masak> no, I'm still on t4 reviews, thank you very much.

[12:24] <colomon> \o

[12:25] <masak> jnthn++ # http://6guts.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/nqp-gets-moarvm-support-cursor-reduction-and-other-news/

[12:26] <masak> jnthn: oh, and in case you were wondering "Allocating Less Cursors" -- that would be a good time to use "fewer", since "cursor" is not used as a mass noun there.

[12:26] <colomon> masak++

[12:29] <jnthn> masak: That distinction is probably gone by the next generation, much like whom is mostly gone to mine. :)

[12:29] <masak> please, no karma. I feel bad enough already being a grammar nazi... :)

[12:30] <jnthn> So by getting it "wrong" I'm simply ahead of my time :P

[12:30] <masak> jnthn: I'm a firm believer of language being a flexible, evolving thing. but that argument is silly, and I hope you realize that.

[12:31] <jnthn> masak: I wasn't being entirely serious about the second bit, but there's at least a grain of truth in the first.

[12:32] *** spider-mario joined
[12:32] *** SamuraiJack joined
[12:32] <masak> there are certainly "less/fewer" fights not worth having. such as ss/6 items <(or less)>/or fewer/ -- see http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003775.html

[12:33] <masak> but in the case of "less cursors", that just sounds wrong to me because the distinction makes sense to uphold.

[12:34] <JimmyZ> are you talking about designing english?

[12:34] <nwc10> masak: I also thought this

[12:35] <nwc10> https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=10+items+or+fewer&gbv=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=80FZUsTZJsLG4gSbs4GwBg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ

[12:35] <masak> JimmyZ: no, just following it in its current implementation.

[12:35] <jnthn> JimmyZ: No, just about a non-native speaker being upset about a construction a native speaker knows is technically wrong, but would never actually react to or intuitively feel is wrong.

[12:35] <masak> :P

[12:35] <masak> jnthn: oh, get off your low horse.

[12:36] <jnthn> When I saw the "5 items or less" article I was like..."so what's wrong with it" :)

[12:36] <masak> me too.

[12:36] <masak> that, to me, is over-reacting.

[12:37] <masak> hm, interesting. I would want it as "5 or fewer items", not "5 or less items". but "5 items or less" is fine to me.

[12:38] <masak> which means that the "or less" probably refers to a *hidden mass noun* of some sort. not the items, but (maybe) the amount representing the items.

[13:13] <Ulti> am I the only person who gets angry when seeing the phrase "in production" in relation to Perl5 or Perl6? no one asks how many people use BASH in production or sed, awk or any other language like tool that's just useful regardless... a better question is anyone using Perl6 for something useful thats hard to accomplish in Perl5, if that question isnt yes who cares if its used in production if there isn't a benefit to doing so!

[13:14] <masak> Ulti: many people are not early adopters.

[13:14] <masak> Ulti: they basically want an answer to the question "did someone else do something serious with it yet?"

[13:14] <masak> I can see where they're coming from.

[13:14] <Ulti> plenty of things are really specific too, lisp in the form of CLIPS is used "in production" for hardware control systems specific to space flight... is that interesting?

[13:15] <Ulti> masak: sure but the problem is everyone else isn't vocal in the perl world

[13:15] <masak> what's that got to do with anything?

[13:15] <Ulti> I've taught about ten people Perl in just the last few years, none of them use the "community" or would think to talk about the tools they use

[13:15] <Ulti> its not something they care about

[13:15] <Ulti> they just assume software tools are like hammers

[13:15] <Ulti> they will always be around in one form or another

[13:16] <Ulti> perl6 could have a thousand early adopters and you wouldnt know unless they were financially invested in everyone else using perl6

[13:16] <masak> to some people, Perl 5 is exactly that: a hammer. they don't go to hammer conferences or workshops -- the entire notion of doing that is meaningless to them.

[13:17] <Ulti> but thats my point perl5 is never going to die, its just become a hammer instead of some luxury gadget worth chatting about

[13:20] <masak> Ulti: I think we're far from that time yet, though. of Perl 5 becoming just a hammer.

[15:51] <jnthn> strdup ain't foudn though...grr

[15:52] <arnsholt> Anyways, my plan forward was something like this:

[15:53] <jnthn> oh...but if I make it _strdup it works :)

[15:53] <arnsholt> 1) Get get_boxed_ref working, so that we can run the NativeCall test suite proper and see what happens

[15:53] <arnsholt> 2) Fix the bugs that shakes out in the stuff that's already supposed to be working

[15:54] <arnsholt> 3) CArray

[15:54] <arnsholt> 4) CStruct

[15:54] <arnsholt> 5) Callbacks

[15:56] <moritz> 6) everything else :-)

[15:56] <arnsholt> Yeah =)

[15:56] <arnsholt> Perhaps an even more fruitful approach would be making 3) Whatever's needed to get DBIish working

[15:58] <moritz> fwiw I'm not sure if DBIish on the JVM should also use NativeCall

[15:58] <moritz> or rather the JDBC drivers

[16:00] <arnsholt> That's a very good point

[16:01] <jnthn> We'll still need NativeCall either way, though.

[16:02] <arnsholt> Oh, definitely!

[21:20] <dalek> nqp/nativecall-jvm: With this we can use the normal nqp::atpos_* with CArray. This means

[21:20] <dalek> nqp/nativecall-jvm: NativeCall can be tweaked to build on JVM also without breaking it on

[21:20] <dalek> nqp/nativecall-jvm: Parrot.

[21:20] <dalek> nqp/nativecall-jvm: review: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/10abc4052f

[21:20] <jnthn> arnsholt: Now that things work, is there any reason to keep this work in a branch?

[21:20] <jnthn> arnsholt: If I merge it now I can just bump NQP_REVISION and update NativeCall, rather than have a branch there too...

[22:26] <lue> Does anyone here with access to feather know why the percabal.org/syn and feather.perl6.nl/syn pages don't list the S99 entry? It bugs me that it's been missing for a while now.

[22:49] <grondilu> I'm kidding of course, what you guys do is almost as awesome as what SpaceX does :)
