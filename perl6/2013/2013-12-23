[05:27] <lue> Anyone got any ideas as to how adding a simple :my $*VAR = 1; and some <?{$*VAR}> checks in alternations can cause Parrot to eat memory until it's killed? :)

[05:27] *** SamuraiJack joined
[05:31] <moritz> lue: does the alternation consume any characters?

[05:32] <lue> yeah, it's my way of doing if/else in regexes.  [$*OPTION '»' | '>']  for instance

[05:32] <lue> rather, [<?{$*OPTION}> ...

[05:33] <lue> (the idea being that the assertion ends up acting as either a <?> or <!> .)

[05:35] <moritz> then I don't know

[05:35] <moritz> maybe starting with --rxtrace is enlightening?

[05:35] <moritz> or with Regex::Tracer

[05:37] <lue> I'll try --rxtrace, though I'm very scared to freeze my computer again :D

[05:37] <lue> moritz: I was half-expecting you to say "that's not how you should be doing that *at all*, of course it's going to eat up memory!" :)

[09:01] <masak> my post got HN'd. even though it wasn't actually very special.

[09:03] <cosimo> and... Good $Morning!

[09:05] <masak> even the HN discussion is civil.

[09:06] <masak> about 2/3 "why Perl instead of Python" (with gentle answers) and 1/3 "what's the state of Perl 6?"

[09:07] <masak> the only way to make people start caring about Perl 6 is to develop something indispensible in it that people can't afford to ignore :)

[09:07] <masak> then they will stop saying "you can safely ignore Perl 6 for now" and start saying "I've been keeping an eye on Perl 6 for years -- you should check it out!"\

[15:57] <nwc10> now that it seems that Parrot is no longer on a regular release schedule, is there a plan for how to redfine the Rakudo release schedule? if so, is it "Thursday following third Tuesday of the month" or is it going to move a bit?

[15:57] <nwc10> [And will there be heretics releasing on the old date? :-)]

[15:57] <nwc10> http://london.pm.org/about/faq.html#heretics

[15:57] <FROGGS> "1987 - Larry Wall falls asleep and hits Larry Wall's forehead on the keyboard. Upon waking Larry Wall decides that the string of characters on Larry Wall's monitor isn't random but an example program in a programming language that God wants His prophet, Larry Wall, to design. Perl is born."

[15:58] <FROGGS> http://james-iry.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html

[15:58] <moritz> nwc10: fwiw I'm in favor of doing the rakudo compiler release earlier in the month, so that more time remains to release R* in the same month

[15:59] <nwc10> also, does Rakudo actually support most recent parrot, now that the old Packfile code has gone?

[15:59] <nwc10> earlier makes sense for that reason

[15:59] * moritz has no idea

[17:32] <pera> I'm curious: is there anything like 'tie' in perl6? :)

[17:33] <geekosaur> I imagine it's not core, since it's a role like any other that you can implement

[17:35] <TimToady> tie was abandoned because it pessimizes every variable to always remain tieable

[17:35] <TimToady> but we have several other more controlled mechanisms to accomplish similar things, as long as you set up your declarations right

[19:55] <andrers52> Hi!

[19:55] <andrers52> I'm starting to read "Using Perl 6"

[19:56] <andrers52> and I think I've found a bug in an example. So, I'd like to contribute :)

[19:56] <lue> moritz: am I right in thinking you've released the December compiler now?

[19:57] <moritz> lue: yes

[19:57] *** rurban1 joined
[19:57] <moritz> andrers52: that's very kind of you.

[19:57] <moritz> andrers52: what's the bug?

[19:58] <andrers52> in the first example, the program to check who wins the games, the else allows the draw to be accounted as a win to player 2

[20:00] <andrers52> if $r1 > $r2 {

[20:00] <moritz> andrers52: there are now draws in table tennis :-)

[20:00] <andrers52> %matches{$p1}++;

[20:00] <andrers52> } elsif $r1 < $r2 {

[20:00] <andrers52> %matches{$p2}++;

[20:00] <andrers52> }

[20:00] <timotimo> linguist has perl6 support now!

[20:00] <moritz> s/now/no/

[20:01] <andrers52> that's it for now. I'm not sure this was the best place to show this.

[20:01] <timotimo> unfortunately, Using Perl 6 hasn't been updated in a long time :(

[20:01] <andrers52> I would like to thank you all for your efforts and I hope I can make much more contributions!

[20:01] <timotimo> sure :)

[20:01] <timotimo> hang out on this channel to absorb knowledge, if you want to :P

[21:37] <moritz> lue: nope

[21:38] <moritz> lue: that's either from something you did previously, or from forgetting to bump some versions

[21:38] <lue> no, I was looking at the webpage directory listing

[21:39] <moritz> no, it says 22-Nov-2013 as the time stamp

[21:39] <moritz> so, not my fault :-)

[21:39] <moritz> (at least not this month :-)

[21:39] <lue> ? I did the end-of-october release last time.

[21:39] <lue> "gzip: stdin: unexpected end of file" is what I get from the nqp tarball :/

[21:40] <lue> oh wait, my fault I believe

[21:40] <lue> yep, it was :)

[21:40] <moritz> phew.

[21:41] * moritz deletes the stray rakudo download in the nqp/ dir

[21:41] <lue> somehow the downloader (wget I think...?) doesn't delete files that turned out to not exist in the source location :/

[21:41] <timotimo> hmm, not terribly many exciting changes this month

[21:42] <timotimo> i better get my act together for next month's release!

[21:42] <lue> ✔ ③ tools/star/Makefile completed successfully

[21:44] <moritz> I don't think so

[21:45] *** ggoebel117 left
[21:45] <lue> What I thought. I'm almost tempted to say that submodule additions/removals/etc. should happen during the month, not as part of the release process. But oh well.

[21:45] <moritz> +1

[21:45] <lue> ✔ ④ Add 0 submodules to R*

[21:45] <timotimo> that's a good point.

[21:47] <Rotwang> dont you have automated release process?

[21:47] <lue> it's either that or some sort of PLS_ADD_THESE_MODULES_TO_NEXT_RS_KTHXBAI.txt file :)

[21:47] <Rotwang> like continuous delivery and stuff

[21:48] <lue> uuhhh, Perl6-MIME-Base64 just gave me a MERGE_MSG to fill out. o.o

[21:48] <timotimo> someone must have changed the star submodule to a fork or something

[21:48] * lue backs out and investigates

[21:48] <timotimo> use gitk or git log --graph --abbrev-commit --all to figure out what's going on?

[21:52] <timotimo> gitk is good, aye

[21:53] <lue> never used it before though. I see something weird going on at the top of the tree. I wonder if deleting the submodule and trying to get it clean would help...

[21:54] <timotimo> hah

[21:54] <timotimo> the most important bit is the green rectangles

[21:54] <timotimo> and the one that has bold text in it

[21:54] <timotimo> the rectangles are branches, the bold one is the currently checked out branch

[21:55] <lue> ...all the rectangled [remotes/origin/...] things have the same weight, i.e. no bold

[21:58] *** BenGoldberg joined
[21:58] * lue just does the remove/reobtain thing

[22:11] <lue> timotimo: I got back a pre-merge Perl6-MIME-Base64, and gitk is showing no bolded rectangles. I think it may be in a detached HEAD state :/

[22:12] <BenGoldberg> Like the headless horseman?

[22:12] <lue> yeah, detached HEAD. No clue why :/

[22:13] <lue> oh, wow. A random sampling of a couple other submodules shows similar detached HEADs.

[22:14] <FROGGS> that would explain why we had outdated modules in a R* a few months back, right?

[22:15] <lue> maybe. The random sample was all(PSGI, Math-Model) for the record

[22:16] <lue> Lemme see if adding a --rebase to the submodule's pull command helps...

[22:17] <timotimo> oh, wait

[22:17] * lue just realized he could've done  git submodule foreach git branch  to see the attached-ness of every submodule :)

[22:17] <timotimo> the submodule system checks out a specific commit

[22:17] <timotimo> so yeah, that would be a detached head for every submodule

[22:18] <lue> wait, I don't think a rebase is what I wanted. (gitk will likely show me how badly I screwed up Base64's tree this time :P)

[22:20] <timotimo> you probably just want to checkout a more recent commit?

[22:20] <lue> yeah, I just pulled a commit futureward with that --rebase :/

[22:20] <timotimo> otherwise you'd also have to push to the upstream repo

[22:20] <lue> timotimo: the issue is that the given command to update the submodules in the release guide causes that merge commit, and I don't know of another way to update the submodules.

[22:23] <lue> I'll try the command once more, maybe getting a clean Base64 fixes it somehow?

[22:23] <timotimo> you want to git fetch and then git reset --hard to a given commit

[22:25] <timotimo> i'm going to bed now

[22:25] <timotimo> gnite and good luck! :)

[22:25] <FROGGS> gnight timotimo 

[22:25] <lue> bah!

[22:27] <lue> timotimo: :/ Probably would work, but I shouldn't have to hunt for specific SHA1s

[22:29] <timotimo> you don't have to

[22:29] <timotimo> git reset --hard origin/master

[22:29] <timotimo> it's that easy :)

[22:29] <lue> ah :)

[22:30] <lue> moritz: am I doing or did I do something fundamentally wrong to land in this mess? just curious

[22:30] <timotimo> no, you didn't

[22:30] <timotimo> what was the exact command the guide told you to run?

[22:31] <hoelzro> hi all

[22:31] <lue> git submodule foreach git pull origin master

[22:31] <lue> (RG here for reference: https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/tools/star/release-guide.pod)

[22:31] <hoelzro> I'm on holiday, but I wanted to point this out: https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/858

[22:31] <hoelzro> \o\

[22:31] <hoelzro> /o/

[22:31] <hoelzro> \o/

[22:32] <lue> 🙌 (we already found out about it though :P)

[22:33] * hoelzro goes back to holiday

[22:33] <lue> timotimo: is there something wrong with that git pull that you can spot?

[22:34] <timotimo> well, it's obvious why the error came to be

[22:34] <timotimo> someone went and checkout'd a commit in the submodule that diverged from master

[22:34] <timotimo> and git pull origin master would cause a merge, because it's not a fast-forward any more

[22:35] <lue> That wasn't obvious from the gitk screen :) . Perhaps I didn't have enough verbosity enabled...

[22:35] <timotimo> right; did it show something marked HEAD?

[22:36] <timotimo> or a commit that was in boldface?

[22:36] <lue> timotimo: as I said, nothing was bolded. Which lead me to suspect there was a detached HEAD.

[22:36] <timotimo> right.

[22:36] <lue> (neither before nor after a merge, to be more clear)

[22:36] <timotimo> well, detached HEAD is the normal state for submodules after init + update.

[22:37] <timotimo> i can see why it would be, from an implementor's perspective, but it's still not cool :P

[23:13] <lue> Just skimmed the README, and I'm not sure I like how you (seemingly) can't install R* to /usr/local. But that's not anything to fuss over right now.
