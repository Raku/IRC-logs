[08:57] <timotimo> diakopter: yeah. in germany, not many people drive automatic

[09:01] <timotimo> the wikipedia article only tells what the individual car makers call their automatic transmissions, but not how many are sold in relation to manual transmissions

[09:03] *** dayangkun left
[09:05] <DrEeevil> for germany I'd expect something around 5%, maybe less

[09:05] <timotimo> yeah, that seems about right

[09:13] <FROGGS> well, the percentages are increasing a bit nowadays

[09:14] <FROGGS> where nowadays is like since 10 years

[09:14] <FROGGS> because, who of the audi drivers has a manual transmission?

[09:15] <FROGGS> even my colleges who drive ford or renault drive an automatic

[09:17] <timotimo> interesting

[09:18] <timotimo> well, i'm looking forward to owning a car that parks itself while i stand next to it

[09:18] <timotimo> i wonder if i'd be insured against damages the car does to itself and other cars by errors the automatic parking commits

[09:18] <FROGGS> I am looking forward to own a car at all :o)

[09:19] <FROGGS> have none now since a year

[09:19] <FROGGS> don't count on it :o)

[09:20] <timotimo> well, my current car is a mini, so parking is already pretty easy

[09:21] <timotimo> i'd still like having a car that can drive sideways or turn on the spot, though

[09:22] <FROGGS> well, I had an opel omega (2.5 V6 automatic)... I want to have it back √≥.√≤

[09:23] <timotimo> seems like a nice car

[09:23] <timotimo> limousine or kombi?

[09:23] <Suhosin> I miss having a car

[09:23] <FROGGS> limousine

[09:23] <Suhosin> But I live on a main shopping road, and 15 min by bus from work

[09:23] <Suhosin> I just didnt use it :P

[09:23] <FROGGS> cars are cool, if don't have to buy fuel and need to repair them

[09:23] <timotimo> hm. i had an old kombi A4 a year before the mini; i liked having a whole lot of space in the trunk and also being able to see where exactly the back of my car is from inside

[09:24] <Suhosin> I had a 7 series.

[09:24] <FROGGS> Suhosin: 5min to walk to do shopping, 10min to walk to work

[09:24] <FROGGS> timotimo: exactly

[09:25] <FROGGS> that is why I love old cars

[09:25] <FROGGS> you actually see something

[09:25] <Suhosin> But it cost me 2x as much to park it (I have no parking) as for whole region bus pass

[09:25] <timotimo> i don't know many new cars; i also see something in my mini

[09:26] <FROGGS> timotimo: drive a golf and try to see something through the rear window :/

[09:26] <FROGGS> old corsa++

[09:26] <timotimo> hm. i don't remember the golf i drove for driver's ed ...

[09:26] <FROGGS> Suhosin: what is a 7 series? bmw?

[09:26] <Suhosin> FROGGS: Yeah

[09:27] <FROGGS> nice :o)

[09:27] <Suhosin> 4 liter BMW

[09:27] <FROGGS> that was a V10, right?

[09:27] <Suhosin> Great car, expensive to run though

[09:27] <Suhosin> Couldnt tell you :P

[09:27] <FROGGS> we have two engines in our garage

[09:27] <Suhosin> Was a 740i

[09:27] <FROGGS> one was meant to get into a manta

[09:27] <timotimo> manta! haha :)

[09:28] <Suhosin> 1993 I think

[09:28] <FROGGS> :o)

[09:28] <timotimo> kids, grab your manta-fahrer-witze :P

[09:28] <timotimo> or, i guess, old people

[09:28] <timotimo> i don't think people much younger than me remember hearing those from their parents

[09:28] <FROGGS> Suhosin: an E32

[09:28] <FROGGS> Suhosin: ahh, that is an V8

[09:29] <FROGGS> the 750i was an V12 though

[09:29] <Suhosin> FROGGS: All I know is, it was a great drive but was just costing more than I could justify :P

[09:29] <FROGGS> absolutely

[09:30] <Suhosin> I'd get another if I got a job further from home though

[09:30] <FROGGS> my omega was expensive too (built 1996, died 2009), I was unable to pay for repairing it

[09:36] *** dbr joined
[09:39] <masak> good antenoon, #perl6

[09:39] <FROGGS> hi masak 

[09:39] <masak> I have a question about pmurias' grant. I haven't seen any reports on it. what happened to it? was it completed?

[09:40] *** dmol left
[09:40] <FROGGS> I have heard he completed it, though there are some minor issues IIRC

[09:40] <FROGGS> got a bit quiet about it though

[09:41] *** raiph left
[09:41] <timotimo> grant?

[09:41] <FROGGS> the gsoc project

[09:41] <timotimo> do you refer to the GSoC?

[09:41] <timotimo> ah

[09:41] <FROGGS> dunno about a grant

[09:41] <timotimo> well, he wrote many reports on parrot.org

[09:43] <timotimo> last i know he's going to continue work on it some time soon

[09:46] <masak> yeah, I was referring to GSoC.

[09:46] <masak> my question is twofold, really: (a) did he get the full amount of GSoC money? (he deserves it), and (b) did he reach his stated goals?

[09:46] <masak> I'm kinda eager to use Rakudo in the browser...

[09:47] <nwc10> last I remember him saying here (and both my memory and my attention are les then awesome) was that he was waiting to get network to his dormitory room before continuing, because working on it in the corridor wasn't really practical

[09:47] <nwc10> implied was that that (network) would be soon

[09:47] <nwc10> but he seems to have gone dark

[09:50] <masak> I see.

[09:50] <masak> anyway, mad props to pmurias++.

[09:51] <masak> hoping to see the work continue.

[09:52] <timotimo> agreed

[09:58] <timotimo> so, i've used jvisualvm to sample (because profiling causes segfaults immediately) a run of a program i made

[09:58] <timotimo> and it seems like a good portion of the time (15%) was spent in CallFrame.<init>

[10:00] *** xenoterracide left

[10:03] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[10:04] <FROGGS> hi lizmat 

[10:04] <lizmat> I will now start the Rakudo release process

[10:04] <hoelzro> hello lizmat 

[10:04] <lizmat> o/ hoelzro FROGGS!

[10:05] <nwc10> can we send a search party, trailing Cat 5 behind them (instead of string)?

[10:06] <nwc10> because I'd love to see it get to a mergable state.

[10:10] <lizmat> nqp release process, step 2: Change the C<VERSION> file in nqp

[10:13] <dalek> nqp: d24578c | (Elizabeth Mattijsen)++ | VERSION:

[10:13] <dalek> nqp: bump VERSION to 2013.11

[10:13] <dalek> nqp: review: https://github.com/perl6/nqp/commit/d24578cf5d

[10:16] <lizmat> step 3: Make sure everything compiles and runs from a known clean state.

[10:17] <lizmat> hmmm... I see parrot 5.10.0 is out, should I upgrade parrot version or not ?

[10:17] <lizmat> seems premature ?

[10:18] <timotimo> don't.

[10:19] <timotimo> we did not merge the packfile pmc stuff for nqp yet

[10:19] <timotimo> er, packfile api

[10:19] <lizmat> ok, continuing with 5.9.0  :-)

[10:20] <timotimo> next month the build process on parrot will be simplified. that's cool

[10:20] <timotimo> the change had been long time in the making

[10:23] <FROGGS> timotimo: do you think we get the needed changes for packfile done?

[10:23] *** berekuk left
[10:24] <FROGGS> because... we are producing pir (in QRegex for example)... I guess this need to be changed

[10:24] <lizmat> step 4: Create a release tarball

[10:28] *** dmol joined
[10:30] <timotimo> good question. i thought almost all the work was already done and just needs to be properly merged

[10:31] <lizmat> I don't think I can upload the NQP / rakudo tar balls to rakudo.org 

[10:31] <lizmat> suggestions on how to make that happen ?

[10:32] *** bloonix joined
[10:35] <FROGGS> lizmat: ask moritz or masak

[10:36] <lizmat> step 6: Tag NQP by its release month 

[10:37] <lizmat> step 7: Upload the release tarball   (deferring until moritz / masak / jnthn react )

[10:46] <moritz> ... or not, wrong machine, wrong ssh key :(

[10:47] * masak reacts, but a bit too late

[10:47] <masak> I'll let moritz++ do it ;)

[10:48] <moritz> masak: na, you do it, I Just found I don't have the right ssh key with me

[10:48] <masak> well, um.

[10:48] <moritz> I can do it tonight though

[10:48] <masak> I just realized I just formatted the drive with that ssh key on it...

[10:49] <lizmat> ok, I'll wait until jnthn wakes up  :-)

[12:12] <jnthn> argh :P

[12:13] <nwc10> you need an atomic {} to wrap the talk

[12:14] <nwc10> as I understand it the problem *isn't* that you may not be able to commit at the end of the talk

[12:14] <lizmat> good *, jnthn 

[12:14] <nwc10> but that it might never be possible to commit, if the synopsis updates are faster than the implementation update attempts

[12:25] <timotimo> :)

[12:26] <FROGGS> I mean, I can imagine that we'd need to unwind from the current frame to a frame from where the target descends, but I'm not sure that this is right

[12:26] <lizmat> now fetching nqp / parrot for the 5th time, argh

[12:27] <FROGGS> that'd be goto... last/next LABEL should be way easier

[12:28] <timotimo> last/next LABEL would also be way more useful, IMO.

[12:28] <FROGGS> true

[12:28] <timotimo> i can stand to wait another year for regular goto, but next/last/retry label ... i'd love to get it this year for christmas :P

[12:28] <timotimo> (not that i could implement it that quickly, though)

[12:29] <FROGGS> why not?

[12:29] <FROGGS> I mean, we'd just need to put the label into the last/next phaser, and if the loop that got the phaser does not know about that label, it should rethrow

[12:29] <timotimo> ... i guess i lack the knowledge to even begin

[12:30] <timotimo> is it that simple? can't be!

[12:30] <FROGGS> jnthn: ^^

[12:30] <timotimo> i guess i'll get home and look at the actual implementation and see how hard it really will be

[12:31] * FROGGS takes a look now

[12:42] <lizmat> the MANIFEST if from 19 july ??

[12:44] <lizmat> should the MANIFEST be updated manually ??

[12:45] <FROGGS> seems like

[12:45] <lizmat> also: the 2013.10 release contained all the t/spec files

[12:46] <FROGGS> lizmat: there is a make manifest target

[12:47] <lizmat> $ make manifest

[12:47] <lizmat> make: `manifest' is up to date.

[12:47] <lizmat> it most definitely is not up to date

[12:47] <FROGGS> delete it

[12:47] <lizmat> ok, updated, but now all of t/spec lives in it.

[12:48] <lizmat> I guess I can remove those manually

[12:50] <lizmat> ok, so it needs to live in there ?

[12:50] <FROGGS> how would one run the tests otherwise?

[12:51] <FROGGS> that is the reason we bundle them, so one can run the tests months after the release and they still should pass

[12:53] <lizmat> ok

[12:53] <lizmat> fetching nqp / parrot for the 6th time today

[12:53] * lizmat is glad the wifi in the hotel is good

[12:54] <FROGGS> √≥.√≤

[12:56] <timotimo> releasing sounds fun. i should try it some day

[12:59] <jnthn> FROGGS: May be worth getting labeled loops into NQP first, to work out how to do the code-gen tweaks for while etc. For <for> loops in Rakudo I guessed we need to be able to specify a label when creating a MapIter...

[12:59] <jnthn> ...and then check if we match in the handlers in there and re-throw if not.

[12:59] <jnthn> Transporting the label object in the payload.

[13:00] <FROGGS> mhm

[13:00] <FROGGS> so, I'd prepare the grammar first, making a duplicate declaration explode

[13:01] <jnthn> Yeah. Well, we need a Label object and we install instances of that, I think.

[13:01] <jnthn> That's how we put .next/.last etc on it.

[13:01] <FROGGS> ohh, hmmm

[13:02] <jnthn> So it's same as installing a class really
