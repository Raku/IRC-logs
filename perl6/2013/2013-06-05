[03:47] <flussence> colomon: was running Text-Tabs-Wrap tests, there's one that tries to wrap a single 150+char word to 1 column, which looks like it calls a procedural regex over a hundred times. takes a minute on my desktop.

[03:48] <colomon> flussence: so it's kind of awkward code -- but it's also going much slower than it was.  Is that correct?

[03:51] <flussence> yeah. I vaguely remember a long time ago I had a really ugly eval hack there, to work around Rakudo not having closure ranges in regex (the current code is a cleaner workaround for that, but seems really slow)

[03:51] <colomon> so it might be a change in the code rather than a change in Rakudo.

[04:59] <eternaleye> jnthn: One interesting thought: since the actions operate on a match object, and the backtions operate on something other than a match object, could someone use MMD in order to have them be the same object? That'd let you keep 'parse' and 'deparse' for a given construct close together.

[04:59] <eternaleye> Which might help maintainability.

[05:01] <jnthn> Don't see why not

[05:04] <FROGGS_> I propose now officially the names barse instead of deparse and brammer besides bactions

[05:05] <FROGGS_> it feels so natural to have the same letter in front of it :P

[12:15] <Teratogen> what other file extensions does Perl 6 use?

[12:15] <nwc10> *parrot* uses .pbc and .pir

[12:15] <nwc10> Rakudo is mostly written in NQP, which is usually .nqp

[12:15] <Teratogen> thanks

[12:15] <Teratogen> I collect file extensions and mime types

[12:16] <Teratogen> will add those to my list

[12:16] <Teratogen> I already have .pm and .pl

[12:16] <nwc10> some people are writing code as .pm6, but I think that that's redundant, as Perl 6 modules can be distinguised from Perl 5

[12:16] <Teratogen> but .pm6 is in use meaning "Perl 6 Module"?

[14:18] <[Coke]> also - we have no need for time estimated/worked/left, right? Wonder if those are removable.

[14:20] <nwc10> I don't think that perl5 has ever used estimated/worked/left

[14:21] <nwc10> not sure if those are bog-standard RT, custom but installation wide, or per queue

[16:44] <tadzik> sorry if I didn't. I had an exam ~2 hours ago, so really had to be in Poland

[16:45] <sorear> maybe?  you know how my memory is when I don't have my cybernetic augmentations handy

[16:45] <tadzik> heh

[16:45] <tadzik> but I remember you've been asking about my tiling WM during lightning talks the first day

[16:45] <tadzik> my event-triggered memory tells me that

[16:45] <sorear> yes

[16:45] <sorear> was wondering if that was my* xmonad :)

[16:45] <timotimo> tiling wm? do tell :)

[16:45] <tadzik> hehe. Nah, that's my i3 :)

[16:46] <timotimo> oh, i3

[16:46] <timotimo> are you a vim user per chance?

[16:46] <tadzik> yeah, I am :)

[16:46] <tadzik> not a hardcore vimer though

[16:46] <timotimo> my super awesome perl6 presentation framework may be right up your alley :D

[16:46] <tadzik> I'm hardly a poweruser of anything these days :)

[16:46] <tadzik> oh yes, you told me about it :)

[16:46] <tadzik> looking forward to seeing it

[16:46] <timotimo> it uses i3 to snap a time-remaining graph to the bottom and switches focus between vim window and repl/terminal when needed

[16:47] <tadzik> the only thing I know regarding vim and presentations is Vroom, which ingy uses

[16:47] <timotimo> i'll have to repair my darn VM and then i can record a screencast

[16:48] <timotimo> i've realised yesterday that i could drop the i3 requirement and use only tmux (currently it's i3 + tmux)

[16:49] <tadzik> I never got around to try tmux

[16:49] <timotimo> it's pretty excellent

[16:50] *** stevan_ joined
[16:50] <timotimo> its support for commands is pretty great, its splits work so much better than screen splits

[16:50] <tadzik> I only use screen so my irc session doesn't go down

[16:50] <tadzik> I think tiling wms are superior to everything else :)

[16:50] <timotimo> hehe

[16:50] <tadzik> that's probably the main reason I run X

[16:51] <tadzik> well, maybe not

[16:51] <benabik> tmux is nice for switching between X and SSH.

[18:13] <nwc10> It might be possible already. In that, you'd need an NQP that cross-compiles from JVM to Parrot

[18:13] <nwc10> and NQP is already capable of self-hosting on JVM

[18:13] <nwc10> so it might also be capable of being a cross compiler

[18:13] *** FROGGS joined
[18:14] <nwc10> or it might not, because it might be that the PIR output steps rely on code written in PIR

[18:14] <timotimo> right.

[18:46] <flussence> *triple* /e?!

[18:47] <timotimo> can you explain in simple terms what /e did in perl5?

[18:47] <sorear> s/foo/bar/ = s[foo] = 'bar';

[18:47] <jnthn> I triple /e when I parse floating point

[18:47] <sorear> s/foo/bar/e = s[foo] = bar;

[18:47] <flussence> s/$foo/$bar/e evals $bar

[18:47] <sorear> s/foo/bar/ee = s[foo] = eval bar;

[18:47] <sergot> hi ! o/

[18:47] <flussence> s///ee, I've never actually gotten desperate enough to use that :)

[18:49] <sorear> actually /e is not an eval, it's much closer to s[foo] =bar

[18:49] <sorear> it compiles to a loop, no runtime parsing

[21:59] <timotimo> about time i write some tests for my code here ...

[21:59] * lue thinks the synopsis html generators are running. feather.perl6.nl's S02 is outdated in the second Twigils section too.

[21:59] <quietfanatic> contrast with this.  It's the .so returning immutable results that causes the problem

[22:21] <timotimo> is the gong gonged when the person is ready or is the timing just very good on most of those talks?

[22:34] <diakopter> why missing?

[22:34] <timotimo> i'm watching the stream and someone yelled "code of conduct!"

[22:34] <pmichaud> there was a bit of a hugfest at stage left

[22:35] <mst> your sarcasm detector appears to be faulty

[22:37] <timotimo> for $f!Field::spawn-pellets() ⏏-> $pc { ← "two terms in a row" at the ->   -   am i doing private method invocation wrongly?

[22:38] <timotimo> mst: your comment about why you have a windows machine was about the thinkpad instant-system-reinstallation button? i only heard the first few seconds of it on stream

[22:38] <flussence> I heard it as "multi screen works properly"

[22:38] <mst> timotimo: it was about "the bundled thinkpad tools talk to projectors very nicely"

[22:38] <timotimo> oh, ok

[22:39] <RedditAnalytics> they need to come out with a laptop that has three screens that fold out.  I know they can do it

[22:39] <geekosaur> I thought someone had already. was expensive and fragile as hell though

[22:39] <flussence> after seeing that last one give up with X I don't blame mst :)

[22:41] <timotimo> oh goard; it even asked me "previous line missing a semicolon?" and that's the mistake i made

[22:42] <RedditAnalytics> wow man .. that's just ... bad.  I've NEVER made that mistake.  And a missing bracket?  Never.  

[22:43] <timotimo> :D

[22:44] <timotimo> haha, PiPE is cute. maybe it could be implemented as a slang nicely

[22:48] <RedditAnalytics> about to benchmark how long it takes Perl 6 to parse 1.2 billion records

[22:48] <flussence> see you next christmas :D

[22:48] <RedditAnalytics> is that when v1.0 is ready?

[22:48] <RedditAnalytics> :)

[22:49] <timotimo> that's just "christmas"

[22:49] <pmichaud> ..."with Moar love,  baby!"

[22:49] <timotimo> i did something wrong in my code, what a surprise :P

[22:50] <timotimo> (so slow code, too)

[22:51] <timotimo> i've been asked if i'd like to attend the next functional programming group session locally; with perl6 everything's possible %)
