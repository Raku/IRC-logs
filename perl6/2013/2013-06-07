[08:38] <moritz> welcome back

[08:39] <masak> thank you

[08:39] <masak> I'm going to repack, shower, lie down for a while, and then get on a train.

[08:41] <masak> the weirdest and least traveler-friendly part of the trip back home, oddly enough, was the check-in.

[08:42] <moritz> huh?

[08:42] <moritz> it's usually annoying (queueing/waiting), but not weird

[08:43] <masak> at the airport, they put a check-in machine *in front of* a desk with an official. so the official stands behind the desk watching you punch things in. guys, I don't think you grok check-in machines.

[08:43] <bonsaikitten> masak: that sounds very asian ;)

[08:43] <bonsaikitten> did that guy have a supervisor watching him?

[08:43] <masak> turns out it's *necessary*, though, because the check-in machine found something like 5 things it didn't like with my travel arrangements.

[08:44] <masak> the two things I remember is that the name on my ticket didn't exactly match the name on my passport, and the machine couldn't seat me on my connecting flight because other airline.

[08:44] <masak> a very whiny machine.

[08:44] <moritz> oh indeed

[08:44] <moritz> both are not at all exceptional

[08:45] <masak> oh, and for the flight I got to choose seating on, the screen where I got to choose a seat didn't look enough like an interactive UI, just like an info screen. so I missed my chance to choose a seat.

[08:45] <masak> and when I tried to override manually with the official, she said I already had a window seat, which by the time I got to the plane turned out to be not so.

[08:47] <masak> the flight was uneventful, except that it got delayed >1 h on the ground, because a "highloader" (something that loads baggage) had done the hydraulic equivalent of a bluescreen and wouldn't budge from up against the plane.

[16:55] <masak> sorear: that makes sense. I can see that ensembling into a nice murmur.

[16:55] <masak> sorear: I've heard the same advice, but for a similar Swedish word: "rabarber" (en:"rhubarb")

[17:00] <lizmat> masak: which is actually the same in Dutch

[17:00] *** FROGGS joined
[17:05] <cognominal> TimToady: in an Eisenstein book, there is an expression that is employed many times, is not the index, and apparently explained nowhere. "glad tidings".  Is it specific to some version of the bible?  Are they specific connotations ?  I know this is unrelated to you preach in YAPC::NA that I have seen on video

[17:05] <cognominal> that's in The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe

[17:07] <sorear> diakopter: 77, I think

[17:07] <sorear> diakopter: can't be more than that

[17:07] <masak> lizmat: probably a loan from those parts :)

[17:08] <masak> lizmat: rhubarb is fairly old, culturally. imported along the Silk Road from China. the word in various languages is probably about as old.

[17:09] <yoleaux> 16:14Z <jnthn> FROGGS: no, that doesn't look familiar...

[17:52] <masak> flussence: not if you're programming country and western all day.

[17:52] <timotimo> jnthn: it could very well be that the error message i'm getting from IO::Select comes from my somehow broken state that i haven't been able to fix yet on my laptop

[18:44] <masak> if people want to be in both places, that's already trivially easy.

[18:47] <masak> benabik++ said it better than I could.

[21:06] <lizmat> I could spectest a change?

[21:06] <timotimo> pmichaud: what do you mean with "doesn't know what to do yet"? does that have a deeper meaning or is it just your interpretation of what the output is?

[21:06] <pmichaud> timotimo: I didn't even think there's a &hyper implemented already.

[21:06] <pmichaud> but apparently there is.  it's wrong.

[21:07] * pmichaud wonders if he's to blame there.

[21:07] <timotimo> it seems like the hyper that's implemented is what's being used interally to service >> and >>OP<<

[21:07] <pmichaud> right... in which case it shouldn't be called "hyper"

[21:07] <pmichaud> or there needs to be another multi candidate.

[21:07] <timotimo> mhm

[21:07] <timotimo> not quite sure how i could implement that multi candidate to work together with map

[21:08] <timotimo> unless i could specialcase "hyper map" in the grammar or something :|

[23:13] <timotimo> good call, it doesn't actually work yet

[23:18] <timotimo> something is wrong ...

[23:19] <timotimo> "==> Fetching File::Tools" ... nothing happens

[23:20] <timotimo> perhaps due to the repository not having the right commit or something?

[23:22] *** benabik joined
[23:27] <tadzik> hmm

[23:27] <tadzik> no idea

[23:31] <dalek> roast: Some more tests for adverbial pair combinations

[23:31] <dalek> roast: 

[23:31] <dalek> roast: Comments are still rough, will fix later

[23:31] <dalek> roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/688c39f0b3

[23:34] <timotimo> tadzik: it's kind of hard to find thingg slike that :|

[23:35] *** splitcells joined
[23:38] <splitcells> is it possible to launch binaries from a perl6 script?

[23:38] <colomon> splitcells: yes

[23:38] <splitcells> how?

[23:39] <timotimo> r: shell "echo 'foo'";

[23:46] <timotimo> tadzik: i can't find any usage of .announce('fetching', but it displays the Fetching somethingsomething string, the fuck?

[23:46] <tadzik> timotimo: um, is it not in Panda.pm?

[23:47] <timotimo> oh ... facepalm, i guess

[23:48] <tadzik> sleep time for me, see you tomorrows o/

[23:53] <flussence> okay, I tried rerunning that script I posted above after putting «is pure» on Buf.new, .decode and Str.comb. Doesn't break tests but also doesn't change speed at all.

[23:53] <flussence> (also I've noticed significant pauses every second or so in the loop)

[23:54] <flussence> (and .comb is by far the slowest part of the whole thing)

[23:55] <timotimo> oh, it seems like it's just utterly crazy-slow

[23:55] <timotimo> or maybe not.

[23:56] <flussence> if I move the Buf.new(...).decode outside the loop, it goes from 7 to 5 seconds per 100 iterations - but moving .comb out too makes it go down to 1.5s per 100

[23:56] *** splitcells left
[23:57] *** splitcells joined
[23:57] *** splitcells left
[23:58] <timotimo> yeah, comb is weirdly slow :(

[23:59] <flussence> it's possible to improve it by hand: ($chars.substr($_, 1) for (^$chars.chars).roll(16))

[23:59] <flussence> (that gets it down to 2s)
