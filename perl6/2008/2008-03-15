[00:00] <Juerd> Haven't heard about/from TimToady in a while. Maybe a week?

[00:02] *** ebassi joined
[00:28] *** aindilis joined
[00:29] *** thoughtpolice joined
[00:30] <TimToady> I am home from the hospital, and now recovering from that...

[00:31] <TimToady> while I was there I got 4 units of blood, a CT scan (negative), and an upper endoscopy (also negative)

[00:32] <araujo> mmm...

[00:32] <allbery_b> whee

[00:32] <araujo> TimToady, what happened to you? (if I may ask)

[00:32] <TimToady> severe anemia, probably from bleeding somewhere

[00:32] <araujo> ouch :-(

[00:33] <TimToady> but it's not a reoccurance of my GIST tumor of 4.5 years ago

[00:33] <TimToady> nor is is stomach ulcers, so possibly ulcers farther down

[00:33] <TimToady> (which is easy to do when you don't have a valve on the bottom of your stomach...)

[00:34] <araujo> :-(

[00:34] *** bbkr_ joined
[00:34] <TimToady> anyway, I'll have more tests over the coming weeks

[00:36] <araujo> TimToady, hope you get well 

[00:36] <TimToady> well, I'm certainly less anemic at the moment, after 4 units...

[00:37] <TimToady> but that's not a good long-term solution

[00:41] <TimToady> and being less anemic, it's even possible I'll be thinking more clearly (or rather, less unclearly :)

[00:42] * diakopter envisions spec reversions

[00:42] * TimToady snorts

[00:42] <araujo> TimToady, it's perl ... nobody blames you no matter what :-)

[00:59] <mncharity> glad you're out.  sorry cause is still unknown.

[01:02] <Juerd> mncharity: Well, having oxygen in your blood does certainly help :)

[01:03] * Juerd has light hemolytic anemia from time to time

[01:03] <Juerd> (caused by G6PD deficiency)

[01:03] <Juerd> In short, it sucks.

[01:04] *** kanru joined
[01:04] <TimToady> vaguely possible mine is hemolytic, and they've just mistaken it for bleeding

[01:04] <TimToady> not sure if they're run all the tests that would distinguish it

[01:05] <Juerd> If it's hemolytic you certainly want to know the cause. The same thing could occur again, and maybe result in a hemolytic crisis

[01:06] <Juerd> There's food and drugs that I should avoid.

[01:07] <Juerd> Including bitter lemon, which I really like

[01:08] <Juerd> Urgh, 2am already. Should try to sleep.

[01:08] <Juerd> Good night!

[01:13] <mncharity> pitty p5 doesn't have a scannerless GLR parser.  python has dparser.  we don't seem to even have a GLR.  :/

[01:15] <mncharity> i suppose someone could wrap http://dparser.sourceforge.net/ for cpan... anyone... :)

[01:15] <lambdabot> Title: D Parser Homepage

[01:20] <kolibrie> mncharity: regarding PCR - fglock wrote lrep, then formalized that into PCR, then redesigned a little bit as MP6, then started KP6

[01:20] <kolibrie> so PCR gets no love because it was only a stepping stone

[01:20] <kolibrie> however, I run PCR in production (well backend, but for production stuff)

[01:21] <kolibrie> I plan on re-examining what is out there to see if I should migrate to something better/faster

[01:26] <mncharity> kolibrie: ah, interesting.  thanks.

[01:27] <mncharity> hmm, I wonder if I should hack a PCR compatibility class for yet_another_regex_engine, just to see if there would be interest in a cleaned up yare as a cpan module.

[01:28] <mncharity> any idea how widely used PCR is?  /me goes to see if cpan has download stats...

[01:28] <kolibrie> mncharity: I doubt many people use it - I may be the only one!

[01:30] <kolibrie> I just submitted my talk proposal for YAPC::NA 2008, so we'll see if they have interest in Practical Extraction with Perl6

[01:32] <mncharity> apparently cpan http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#Plans_for_statistics doesn't have download stats as policy.  pointing to http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/faq/statfaq .

[01:32] <lambdabot> Title: The CPAN Frequently Asked Questions

[01:33] <mncharity> which I can see.  though it might be nice to have some way for people to note which modules they value.  which would address some, but not all, of the lanl concerns.  and would help in cases like this.

[01:34] <mncharity> re "Practical Extraction with Perl6", :)

[01:34] <kolibrie> search.cpan.org has ratings

[01:35] <mncharity> true.  ok, maybe solved problem.  PCR unfortunately has no ratings.

[01:35] *** ikeda joined
[01:36] <kolibrie> TimToady has been working on something or other to help him work out the kinks in STD.pm, but I have not looked at it yet

[01:38] <mncharity> yes.  there's now a src/perl6/STD5_run to make it easy to play with.

[01:40] <mncharity> there's also misc/STD_red/STD_red_run.  but it's a bit out of sync, and hasn't attempted to do the @fate DFA stuff.

[01:42] <mncharity> looks like PCR compatibility for yare could cost a day or so.  ah well.  if there's real interest, let me know.

[01:43] <mncharity> kolibrie: it might be worth adding a rating, mentioning you are using it in production.  thus bumping it over the "there's no sign anyone has every even tried to use this, let alone succeeded" threshold.

[01:44] <kolibrie> well, I never used the CPAN version, just the one in the pugs repo

[01:45] <kolibrie> and if I find a better alternative, I'll switch off of it (PCR is rather slow)

[01:46] <kolibrie> mncharity: I suppose I could add my comments, to at least say the good and the bad

[01:47] <mncharity> the svn log suggests the cpan module is built from the pugs repo.

[01:47] <kolibrie> probably true

[01:47] <mncharity> re comments, "at least say the good and the bad", I think that would be neat.  I'd love to hear that myself.

[01:48] <kolibrie> I am not sure there has been a CPAN release of PCR since some of the stuff I needed was added

[01:49] <kolibrie> and the syntax I'm sure is not current with the p6 spec any more

[01:53] <mncharity> kolibrie: ok, cpan 0.28 looks the same as pugs head.  cpan has a META.yml, pugs has t6/ and temp/ and t.sh.

[01:54] <mncharity> :)

[01:54] *** ikeda joined
[01:55] <mncharity> diff -u -r deleteme/Pugs-Compiler-Rule-0.28 SVN-pugs/perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Rule/|grep -v '\.svn'

[01:56] <mncharity> re 'the good and the bad', what turned out to be the good and the bad?  highlights?

[01:57] <kolibrie> mncharity: it was the first implementation that actually worked

[01:57] <kolibrie> pugs was close, but it still had some problems

[01:58] <kolibrie> plus, I could use it in production because it compiles down to perl5 automatically

[01:58] <kolibrie> that way I can pretend it is perl5 (at a system level) but use the perl6 syntax

[01:59] <mncharity> right

[01:59] <kolibrie> the big bad is that it is very slow

[02:00] <kolibrie> but correct was more important than fast, so I've been using it for about two years

[02:02] <mncharity> re popularity, http://popcon.debian.org/ 's http://popcon.debian.org/source/by_inst.gz | grep perl  might be a proxy stat.

[02:02] <lambdabot> Title: Debian Popularity Contest

[02:04] <mncharity> well yare would certainly be much faster.  whether it would be more or less correct than PCR, good question.

[02:06] <mncharity> probably both. :)

[02:06] <kolibrie> so, I have some sifting to do, but I should be able to get to it soon.  I'm finishing up a rather consuming project at work

[21:03] <pmurias> if i want to write a daemon mode (running across multiple compiler runs) for kp6 is there any protocol i should use?

[21:05] *** ikeda joined
[21:06] <pmurias> or is having a compiler deamon frowned upon?

[21:10] *** dalek joined
[21:12] <spinclad> i see nothing wrong with it.  i might look at emacs or mozilla daemons, to see how they accept new requests...  generally, though, i think reasonable would be: listen for a connection, take a command line, then further stdin from the connection.  multithreading optional as able.

[21:14] <spinclad> passing back status, stdout, stderr... dunno off the top of my head
