[04:45] <mncharity> what's the name of the operation which takes a signature, a capture, and a lexical scope, and dumps the capture values into the scope?  I want to say "bind", but that's already committed to other use.

[04:45] *** stevan_ left
[04:45] *** stevan_ joined
[05:10] <spinclad> dumps the capture values into the signature vars, adding them to the scope?

[05:10] <spinclad> i'd say that is indeed a binding.

[05:12] *** spinclad left
[05:17] <mncharity> spinclad: re, ?, hmm, really?   my fuzzy understanding was that Signatures are receipts for unpacking Captures into scopes, rather than being folded together with scopes.  so its Capture vals into scope vars, mediated by a Signature, rather than signatures having vars.  no?

[05:33] <mncharity> bsb: thanks.  re is that it, well, not quite.   basically I was wondering what

[05:34] *** IllvilJa joined
[05:34] <mncharity> to call the method...    sig.mumble(cap,current_env)    where sig is a signature, cap a capture, and current_env the scope which gets modified.  I suppose

[05:35] <mncharity> it could be called "bind", but

[05:36] <mncharity> that's what the low level (here's a var, there's something else), bind'em (rather than say, assign'em)

[05:36] <mncharity> where the sig.mumble(cap,env) example is more an assignment.

[05:36] <mncharity> sig.assign(cap,env) ?

[05:36] <mncharity> blech

[05:37] <mncharity> so a was hoping for a name for a Sig and a Cap getting together.

[05:37] <spinclad> same operation as  sig := cap  in the current env

[05:37] *** chacha_chaudhry joined
[05:37] <spinclad> :$sig := |$cap

[05:37] <mncharity> hmm, ok, so I guess "bind" it is...

[05:42] <pugs_svn> r19604 | putter++ | [kp6] docs/ruby_backend.txt: s/mumble/bind/g, for the name of a

[06:58] <nex6> i saw an artical posted on slashdot linked to a post,  (http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/08/01/21/044255.shtml)

[06:58] <nex6> s/sawa/says/

[06:59] *** drbean joined
[06:59] <Auzon> Rakudo is the name of the Perl 6 implementation on Parrot

[06:59] <Auzon> Perl 6 now means the specification

[07:00] *** ozy` joined
[07:00] <ozy`> yodu des

[07:00] <nex6> so, will there be *other* implamentations?

[07:01] <agentzh> nex6: pugs is one already.

[07:01] <Auzon> Pugs and smop

[07:01] <Auzon> kp6 and mp6, though they aren't intended to be fully Perl 6

[07:02] <nex6> then is the Perl6 spec finialized? eg useable for production?

[07:02] <agentzh> nex6: not yet.

[07:02] <Auzon> I'm not 100% sure, so someone should correct me if I'm wrong. But as I see it, we need at least one working implementation to make sure the spec is good

[07:03] <ozy`> http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/35400 <== clever

[07:03] <Auzon> I like the name, too

[07:04] <agentzh> sigh. use.per.org is so slow in my place :(

[07:05] <nex6> all the Perl6 implamentations will be  more or less like the parrot/rakudo? no Perl6 package/install? I am just trying to get it all right in my head and make sure i *get it*

[07:05] <agentzh> nex6: currently the most complete implementation for Perl 6 is still Pugs :)

[07:05] <agentzh> nex6: anything that passes the official Perl 6 test suite will be called "perl 6"

[07:06] <Auzon> Eventually, there will be a binary for Rakudo and Pugs

[07:06] <agentzh> nex6: the test suite is living in pugs' repos.

[07:06] <Auzon> Either one runs Perl 6

[07:06] <Auzon> At least, that's how I understand it

[07:08] <allbery_b> actually, neither does.  they both run approximations of perl6 with many fetures missing and many tests still not passing

[07:08] <Auzon> well, either one will run Perl 6

[07:09] <allbery_b> eventually one or the other, or both, and/or some other implementation, will pass the Perl 6.0.0-STD test suite and will officilly be a Perl6

[07:09] <Auzon> That's why we need a good test suite. :)

[07:10] <allbery_b> well, the 6.0.0-STD spec isn't 100% nailed down yet.  close, but not yet, and still possibly subject to changes if it's decided some features just can't be done in a reasonable timeframe

[07:10] <nex6> so, parrot/Perl 6 and pugs/Perl6 will offically be Perl 6 once they mature and pass the test suite and Perl 6 spec is finialzed?

[07:10] *** alester left
[07:10] <agentzh> nex6: according to larry, there won't be official perl 6 ;)

[07:11] <agentzh> nex6: perl 6 tends to have multiple implementations, just like pugs

[07:11] <agentzh> *just like haskell

[07:11] <agentzh> sorry

[07:11] <Auzon> Or Lisp?

[07:11] <allbery_b> hm? official perl6 is anything that passes the spec.  like official unix is anything that asses the open group's spec

[07:11] <agentzh> lol

[07:11] <Auzon> Or C compilers?

[07:11] <allbery_b> *passes

[07:12] <nex6> that makes it kinda clear, i think. so these parrot /Perl 6 is like the "c/C++" languages where there is the spec and the implamentations eg compliers?

[07:12] <agentzh> nex6: yup

[07:12] <agentzh> nex6: that's the intention.

[07:12] <allbery_b> at the moment there are two implementations in the pugs repo:  pugs itself, and kp6 which translates (a subset of) perl6 into another language; ones I know of are perl5, common lisp, and ruby 1.9

[07:13] <Auzon> I'm sad that the Javascript one didn't survive. That sounded so cool

[07:13] <nex6> hmm, never knew that. guess i always assumed it would be like Perl5, and an offical one would be released

[07:13] <agentzh> i really hope i am smart enough to let the haskell core go :)

[07:13] <agentzh> learning haskell!!!

[07:14] <agentzh> Auzon: the JS backend is still here but needs love :)

[07:14] <allbery_b> javascript might come back.  I think that was in a predecessor to kp6 (mp6) which has been dropped

[07:14] <Auzon> I don't know Javascript. I was hoping to use Perl 6 to avoid it :P

[07:14] *** ozy` left
[07:15] <Auzon> or at least for complex Javascript

[07:15] <agentzh> JS is beautiful (to some extend) ;)

[07:15] *** devogon joined
[07:15] <allbery_b> (oh, and yhc can be used to translate haskell to javascript :)

[07:16] <Auzon> Eh. We can just make a Firefox extension that embeds Parrot.

[07:16] <agentzh> sure we can! :D

[07:17] <Auzon> Then again, compiling Perl 6 to Javascript would be browser and plugin/extension independent

[07:18] *** goofy_barney joined
[07:18] <Aankhen``> I don't see how you'd implement reading from a file in JSâ€¦

[07:19] <Aankhen``> At least, I don't see how you'd do it in a "browser and plugin/extension independent" manner.

[07:19] <Auzon> True. But some things don't make sense in that context

[07:19] <Auzon> In exchange, you'd get the DOM

[07:20] <Aankhen``> Err, wha?

[07:20] <Auzon> You'd get the document object model, which makes sense in Javscript

[07:20] <Auzon> reading a file doesn't

[07:21] <Aankhen``> Um.

[07:21] <Aankhen``> You could use a module to parse documents into a DOM and use DOM methods on them in regular Perl 6 as well.

[07:21] <Auzon> True

[07:22] <Auzon> I assume you'd automatically get the DOM as an object in the Javascript context though

[07:22] * Aankhen`` shrugs.

[07:22] <Auzon> I'm just rambling, I guess.

[07:22] <Aankhen``> Wouldn't really make sense to have it any other way.

[07:22] <Aankhen``> Anyway, ignore me.  I used to love JS, but nowadays I can't stand it.

[11:30] <pugs_svn> r19605 | ruoso++ | [smop] native capture lowlevel c calls receive the interpreter reference, as they may need to recurse to call WHICH in the case of named arguments. But fortunally, the constant identifiers come to rescue and enable the bootstrap.

[11:38] <pugs_svn> r19606 | ruoso++ | [smop] locking in native capture .positional and .invocant... .named still not implemented.

[11:58] *** AzureBOT left
[12:02] *** njbartlett joined
[12:03] <ruoso> actually... I should consider that manipulating a capture in lowlevel c calls cannot recurse at all... so, the lowlevel capture calls won't accept named arguments that are not constant identifiers....

[12:04] <ruoso> but this same type will accept it through high-level calls that will be evaluated in the interpreter loop, that then will have how to recurse to call WHICH...

[15:18] <masak> Lorn: reading the comments, you'll see that it's not the question of an actual release

[15:18] <pbuetow> it existed earlier, but without perl6 binary, afaik

[15:18] <moritz_> aye

[15:18] <moritz_> but "perl6 binary" isn't a fully fledged Perl 6 compiler

[15:20] * ruoso thinks making understand that as a perl6 release may cause even more confusion about p6 development

[15:39] *** rdice joined
[15:44] <ruoso> DESTROYALL don't receive parameters, do it?

[15:45] <ruoso> I think I'll stablish that the capture for the DESTROYALL method will always be the object being destroyed instead of a capture object with only that object as the invocant

[15:48] <ruoso> TimToady, do you think this is a viable simplification? admiting that the capture sent to DESTROYALL is the object being destroyed instead of a capture with just that object as the invocant?

[15:50] <ruoso> this way I would avoid having to create a new object instance to be able to destroy a object instance...

[15:52] <ruoso> this would mean that the Signature for DESTROYALL would be :(|$invocant) instead of :($invocant: )

[19:30] <pugs_svn> r19614 | ruoso++ | [smop] the native capture have a new important method called "may_recurse". This is only true when there are non-constant-identifiers in the capture. Some low-level classes (like slime) cannot recurse, and therefore it is a deadly error to try to create a new slime object with

[19:30] <pugs_svn> ..using non-constant-identifiers as the key for named arguments.
