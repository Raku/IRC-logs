[00:01] <mncharity> had a < 2 sec startup.  eh.  are there other potential payoffs from mx::c?

[00:03] <mncharity> hmm, I said eh, but once we start regularly running the test suite, that 2 sec may start to be a bottleneck, given STD_red parse caching.

[01:55] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 20223 - Pugs - Trac

[01:55] <Auzon> What do you mean by slushy?

[01:56] <mncharity> slushy is in between active and frozen.  /me looks for good definition...

[01:57] <Auzon> so maintained?

[01:58] <mncharity> bbiam

[02:01] *** silug left
[02:01] <mncharity> back,

[02:03] <mncharity> re maintained, yes.  depends what you mean.  with it's own copy of STD_red, it's only external dependencies are on perl and ruby.  biggest risk there is ruby 1.9 over future releases.  so relatively bitrot resistant.  however,

[02:04] <mncharity> s/ruby 1.9/ruby 1.9 drift/

[02:05] <mncharity> as it freezes, it is increasingly considered feature complete.  bug complete too.  the later both to focus development on HEAD, and so that people can depend on behavior not changing.

[02:06] <mncharity> old elfs can be thought of as old svn revs, but more convenient because you can keep running them, and they've been tweaked to avoid rotting.

[02:07] <mncharity> answered?

[02:07] <Auzon> Very well, thanks :)

[02:07] *** [particle] joined
[02:08] <Auzon> Have you done any benchmarking to see how much slower things get when adding another elf? If I remember correctly, that was a large problem with KP6.

[02:10] <mncharity> not really.  mainly just watching the self-compile time.

[02:11] <Auzon> aren't you compiling each new version with the immediately previous version?

[02:11] <mncharity> elf_b, the first bootstrapped elf, was significantly slower than elf_a.  10 sec vs 2? sec.  and slower to start (2 sec vs noise).  since then its been stable.

[02:12] *** aindilis left
[02:12] <mncharity> re compiling, no.  generally, things start off with a version being compilable by itself and its predecessor.  but elf_c for

[02:12] <mncharity> instance became solely self-compiling.  it could no longer be compiled by elf_b.

[02:13] <mncharity> basically the tradeoff is between the additional hassle of being only self-compiling, vs the hassle of updating the predecessor sufficiently to keep compiling the new version.

[02:14] <Auzon> oh, I see. So elf_c rolled in more changes than I expected

[02:15] <Auzon> I just expected you to implement elf_{n} in elf_{n-1}, and anything past that point would go to elf_{n+1}

[02:16] *** ruoso left
[02:17] <Auzon> I must be going. It was nice to talk :)

[02:17] <mncharity> one could, and end up with a chain.  but it's not clear that buys you very much.  if the environment breaks something, or a latent bug gets introduced but not noticed, you're not much better off if you have a chain than when you have a series of "releases".  atleast while

[02:17] *** ruoso joined
[02:17] <mncharity> the executable form is still so easily directly edited.

[02:17] <Auzon> Makes sense :)

[02:17] <SamB> what is this -- the demoscene?

[02:17] <mncharity> re talk, indeed :)

[02:17] <SamB> editing executables directly!

[02:18] <mncharity> its just p5, and "looks almost like hand written" as well.

[02:18] <SamB> oh

[02:18] <SamB> sorry, you kept using the word "elf"

[02:18] <SamB> that confused me ;-)

[02:19] <Auzon> elf is the name of the interpreter/compiler/thing

[02:19] <mncharity> ooohhhhh.   drat.  didn't think of that.  bzzzt.  unfortunate name collission

[02:19] <SamB> hahahaha

[02:19] <Auzon> At least you didn't pick gnome :P

[02:19] <mncharity> think green hat, pointy ears, working with Santa

[02:19] <mncharity> lol

[02:19] <SamB> gnome would have been less confusing though

[02:19] <mncharity> LOL :) # re gnome

[02:19] <SamB> since GNOME has little to do with compilers

[02:20] <mncharity> ah well.  elf is all about making itself obsolete by allowing people to write _real_ p6 compilers.

[02:21] <mncharity> name just has to survive some months.

[02:22] *** lisppaste3 left
[02:23] <mncharity> anyone know state-of-the-art on p5 multiple dispatch?  a quick microbench sugggests  a simple method-call plus dispatch to sub in hash indexed by ref of first (well, second) argument wouldn't be significantly more expensive than a double method call.

[02:26] *** stevan_ joined
[02:27] <mncharity> (the double method call being what you pay in a single dispatch workaround "visitor" kludge)

[02:27] <mncharity> hi stevan_ :)

[02:28] <stevan_> heya mncharity 

[02:28] <mncharity> and since we have control over the compiler, we can punt the arity check.  go directy to method_foo_called_with_one_extra_dispatching_argument

[02:29] <mncharity> stevan_: Moose have anything multiple-dispatchy I can use? :)

[02:30] <mncharity> getting rather tired of fighting single dispatch, and watching it distort and complicate things.

[02:31] <mncharity> as long as the cost is only ~3x or 4x that of a method call

[02:31] *** lisppaste3 joined
[02:31] <mncharity> oh, objective is multimethods rather than multisubs.

[02:32] <stevan_> nope, Moose doesnt even ry to go there

[02:32] <stevan_> even LISP cant do it fast :P

[02:32] <mncharity> so have time for the original method call, the final sub call, a couple of refs and other ops.  maybe squeze in another sub call.

[02:32] <mncharity> lol

[02:32] <stevan_> there is Data::Bind

[02:33] <mncharity> different definition of fast though :P

[02:33] <mncharity> hmm, Data::Bind...

[02:36] <mncharity> Since having control of the compiler let's one play games one can't with a pure p5 module... hmm, maybe scavange Moose reflection stuff, so can easily say collect the set of named-for-easy-spotting multimethod subs from the inheritance tree, with the type constraints encoded in name perhaps, and then assemble the actual dispatchers from those.

[02:40] <mncharity> re Data::Bind, interesting, but no.  let's see..

[02:41] *** aindilis joined
[02:42] <mncharity> re LISP fast, but one of several advantages of perl of CL is never hearing "yes X would be nicely expressive and save you work, but we don't know how to compile it efficiently so you can't have it". :)

[02:42] <mncharity> s/of/over/

[02:42] <mncharity> sort of like haskell in that respect

[02:45] <mncharity> re Moose and MMD, just having double dispatch, invocant and the first argument after that, would allow people to get away from single-dispatch visitor workarounds.  hmm, as long as the inheritance tree is flatish.

[02:46] <mncharity> though dameon(sp?) had a "use a regex to do type recognition" hack for some mmd module.  wonder what that costs...

[02:46] <stevan_> mncharity: nothingmuch is working on something to do basic type based dispatching

[02:46] <mncharity> ah, released?

[02:46] <stevan_> so loc(DateTime $x) will dispatch to loc_datetime($x)

[02:47] <mncharity> oh, hmm.

[02:47] <stevan_> no, he is currently fighting the eurorail customer service nightmare I think

[02:47] <mncharity> eep

[02:47] <stevan_> next week I think

[02:47] <stevan_> cause we need it for $work stuff

[02:47] <stevan_> it will be intentionally simplistic though

[02:49] <mncharity> I'm thinking more   multi method m(Int $i){3}  aka  multi method m ($self : $i ;;) {3}  which could be compiled to   sub m { my $self=shift;  if(ref($_[0]) eq 'Int'){3} else {die} }.   well, "could be", wouldn't want to.

[02:50] <mncharity> multi method m (Int $n;; $none, $of, $this, $affects, $dispatch) { $hash_from_somewhere{ref($_[1]}->(@_) }

[02:51] <mncharity> multi method m (Int $n;; $none, $of, $this, $affects, $dispatch) { goto $hash_from_somewhere{ref($_[1]}; }

[02:51] <mncharity> err, ok, that was a bizarre mix of p6 and p5

[02:51] <mncharity> multi method m (Int $n;; $none, $of, $this, $affects, $dispatch) {...}  compiled to   sub m { goto $hash_from_somewhere{ref($_[1]}; }

[02:53] <mncharity> class X { multi method m (Int $n;; $whatever) { 3 } multi method m (Num $n){4} };  X.new.m(3);  ->   {package X; sub m { goto $my_hash{ref($_[1]}; }}

[02:54] <mncharity> minor matter of collecting the info, and code generating(?) that sub.

[02:55] <mncharity> :/

[02:55] *** jan_ left
[02:55] <mncharity> but performance should be < 2 method calls.

[02:55] <mncharity> or ~= 2 method calls anyway.

[03:00] <mncharity> stevan_: any nice Moose infrastructure to ask "gimme a list of all the method names available for class X, directly or through inheritance"?

[03:01] <stevan_> Class->meta->compute_all_applicable_methods 

[03:01] <stevan_> returns an array of hashes with CODE ref, class name (i think) and method name

[03:01] <stevan_> Class::MOP::Class has the docs

[03:01] <mncharity> woot :)
