[15:17] <TimToady> was trying to open your reverse patch and hit the wrong button :)

[15:17] <TimToady> and yes, you can bind any object to any sigil, though some sigils may require minimal support of certain roles

[15:18] <moritz_> ah, bp = blood pressure (not obvious for non-natives)

[15:34] <clintongormley> i was trying this out yesterday, and getting weeird results

[15:34] <moritz_> you don't need the parens at all

[15:35] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[[10, 20, 30]]

[15:35] <moritz_> if a statement doesn't produce output, evalbot wraps it with ($statement).perl.say

[15:35] <clintongormley> ok

[15:35] <moritz_> but .perl isn't always perfect in pugs either :(

[15:36] <moritz_> it tends to emit too many captures

[15:36] <moritz_> pugs: say "foo".perl

[15:36] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT["foo"␤]

[15:36] <clintongormley> interesting that my $c =  @a[@b]; say $c.WHAT  reports that it is an ARRAY

[15:39] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[c␤]

[15:40] <moritz_> I guess that the postcircumfix:<[ ]> multi in pugs that handles arrays always returns an array

[15:41] <TimToady> pugs doesn't really do Captures yet

[15:41] <clintongormley> what do you mean by captures here, TimToady?

[15:41] <TimToady> and @@ is called "slice context" for a reason

[15:41] <clintongormley> not Regex captures

[15:42] <moritz_> clintongormley: a capture is something like a reference, but more general

[15:42] <TimToady> a Capture is an argument list that has not yet been bound into a context

[15:42] <clintongormley> ok

[15:42] <clintongormley> i tried a couple of variations of @@ yesterday, but couldn't get it right (or they're not yet implemented in Pugs)

[15:42] <moritz_> that's the official explanation ;)

[15:42] <moritz_> NYI

[15:42] <clintongormley> ...today, anyway ;)

[15:42] <TimToady> pugs does not yet implement @@
