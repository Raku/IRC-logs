[00:34] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/20353

[00:34] <mncharity> (7) I'm puzzled by the $<top> plumbing.  it looks vaguely like $<top> gets created in %thisop by PrecOp, and never gets added operator Match's.  but while one path into EXPR's @opstack uses %thisop, another goes straight from expect_term via @t.  implementation(obviously potentially buggy) symptom is landing in reduce with an $op lacking an $op<top>.

[00:35] <mncharity> eg '3.X eq 4'

[00:36] <mncharity> lots of dev.pugscode.org "Internal Server Error"s today.

[00:37] <TimToady> well, that stuff is all due for a refactor now that the match tree is being sanerish

[00:37] <TimToady> I've actually got some hope of propagating such things up the tree now

[00:39] <mncharity> :/ :)

[00:40] <mncharity> so close... seems to almost work in STD_red.  prefix and postfix operators working for the first time.

[00:41] <mncharity> ok, license to kludge...

[01:29] <mncharity> ah well.  perhaps defer next rev of STD_red until after refactoring.  most of kp6 t/kp6, and 1/4 of pugs t/ is "parsing", for some likely defective value of parsing.  unfortunately not much of t/builtins.  but most of sanity.  so test passing could be chased instead.  sigh.

[01:31] <mncharity> always possible/likely it's a STD_red bug rather than a STD.pm issue.

[01:46] <mncharity> Anyone know the official way to distinguish a hash literal from a code block?

[01:51] <Auzon> pugs: my $x = sub {3}; print $x.WHAT

[01:51] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Sub]

[01:52] <Auzon> pugs: my $x = -> $_ {3}; say $x.WHAT

[01:52] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Block␤]

[01:52] <Auzon> pugs: my $x =  {3}; say $x.WHAT

[01:52] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Block␤]

[01:52] <Auzon> pugs: my $x =  {a => 3}; say $x.WHAT

[01:52] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Hash␤]

[01:53] <Auzon> mncharity: The synopses and Pugs seem to agree that my $x = sub {3} is code, and my $y = 3 isn't

[01:53] <Auzon> Is that what you were after?

[01:55] <TimToady> the top level must be a pair or a list that starts with a pair

[01:55] <mncharity> pugs: {3;4}

[01:55] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[4]

[01:56] <mncharity> pugs: {3,4}

[01:56] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[(3, 4)]

[01:56] <mncharity> thanks :)

[01:56] <TimToady> pugs: my $x = {}; $x

[01:56] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[{}]

[01:56] <TimToady> looks like that defaults to hash too

[01:56] <Auzon> ﻿pugs: my $x = {}; $x.WHAT

[01:57] <Auzon> ﻿pugs: my $x = {}; say $x.WHAT

[01:57] <Auzon> It doesn't like me, apparently.

[01:57] <TimToady> you broke it!!!

[01:57] <TimToady> you had a space at the front of your line

[01:57] <mncharity> pugs: my $x = {}; $x.WHAT

[01:57] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[::Hash]

[01:57] <Auzon> Indeed, even though I couldn't see it. It must be a copy/paste artifact.

[01:57] <TimToady> pugs: my $x = {;}; $x.WHAT

[01:57] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[::Block]

[01:58] <mncharity> ﻿Auzon: crystal ball... you are using a recent version of gnome... and gaim... and cut and pasted...

[01:58] <TimToady> pugs: my $x = {}().WHAT

[01:58] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** Cannot cast from VList [] to Pugs.AST.Internals.VCode (VCode)␤    at /tmp/YnegwjO3Gn line 1, column 4 - line 2, column 1␤]

[01:58] <mncharity> I'm encountering the same issue. :/

[01:59] * Auzon is using Pidgin v2.4.1-1.fc8.

[01:59] <Auzon> but on KDE.

[01:59] <mncharity> hmm.  so much for that causal hypothesis.  neat.

[01:59] <Auzon> I can try it on Gnome in a while.

[02:00] <mncharity> I've been seeing it on the aforementioned gnome+gaim.  so appears to be wm + irc-client independent.

[02:00] <Auzon> Pidgin's name after Gaim 2.0.0.

[02:01] <Auzon> if you didn't realize...

[02:01] <mncharity> ahh.  didn't.

[02:01] <mncharity> back to gaim as hypothesis.

[02:01] <TimToady> the blaim gaim

[02:02] <Auzon> Does it usually happen when you copy/paste?

[02:02] <Auzon> hm, mncharity, it says you're using something based off of libpurple, which would be Pidgin

[02:05] <Auzon> Who maintains exp_evalbot? If it's based on Net::IRC or Bot::BasicBot, then it'd be easy enough to find out what character Pidgin is putting in there

[02:06] <mncharity> some browsers show the character [] box.  if you backlog, someone (spinclad?) said what it was.  non-breaking space maybe?

[02:06] <Auzon> Alright.

[02:08] <TimToady> ah, it's a BOM

[02:08] <TimToady> feff

[02:09] <mncharity> (re BOM(

[02:09] <TimToady> BOMs are an aBOMination

[02:09] <Auzon> heh. Better than an ICBM

[02:10] <Auzon> now, the question is if it happens internally to Pidgin, or just in GTK+ in general

[02:11] <TimToady> so is there anyone who ever copy/pastes from a little-endian window to a big-endian window, or vice versa?

[02:11] <Auzon> Is it even possible to do that on the same computer?

[02:13] <Tene> Auzon: x forwarding

[02:13] <Auzon> I suppose.

[02:20] <Auzon> mncharity: will you type "/debug version" for me? I want to file a bug report against Pidgin once I can determine some characteristics of this problem

[02:21] <mncharity> 17 sanity .t, 6 pass, 2 parsefail, 2 must be a misparse because there's a prefix:<++>, leaving 7 which might be fixable.

[02:21] <mncharity> ﻿/debug version
