[21:45] <masak> @tell moritz I had to revert the commit that activates Text::Escape. It makes things segfault on my box -- try, for example, `./test_wiki.sh` on commit 292670d. In fact, `perl6 -e"use Text::Escape"` segfaults. However, `perl6 -e"use Text::Escape; say "hi"` doesn't segfault, so we're in some kind of Twilight Zone. Until I know more, I'll have to leave it off.

[21:45] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
