[07:32] <ab5tract> after seeing http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-5-to-6/22-state.html

[07:32] <lambdabot> Title: blog | Perlgeek.de Blog :: The State of the implementations

[07:33] <ab5tract> well, i'm particularly curious about how it relates to parrot

[07:33] <ab5tract> the intended sharing nature of them both would make it ironic if they didnt share with each other :)

[07:34] *** alc left
[07:34] <moritz_> I think we have some 20k to 22k tests now

[07:35] <moritz_> but it's hard to obtain real numbers without an implementation that runs them all

[07:35] <moritz_> the coverage... even harder to say

[07:36] <moritz_> maybe 60% to 70% of what is currently in non-draft-synopsis

[07:36] <pmurias> ab5tract: we don't share code at the moment

[07:48] <ab5tract> i guess you could say my support of the project hinges on the developers' intentions re: parrot

[07:48] <pmurias> @tell ruoso i think the leak in 21 is cause by a circural reference between the $back register and the back frame

[07:48] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[07:48] <ab5tract> if it is something in the future to take a shine to, then yes

[07:48] <ab5tract> !

[07:48] <ab5tract> with enthusiasm

[07:49] <pmurias> ab5tract: support, you mean you intend to contribute?

[07:49] <ab5tract> but if there was a consideration to not integrate with parrot even if such a thing wer possible, would be disappointing

[07:50] <ab5tract> i am intrigued by the concept of smop

[07:51] <pmurias> we intend to integrate with many other vm's with perl5 in particular

[07:51] <ab5tract> what language are the test written in

[07:51] <pmurias> mixture of C,m0ld,sm0p and Perl 6

[07:52] <ab5tract> is there web docs for m0ld?

[07:53] <ab5tract> took a look at smop wiki at perlfoundation.org

[07:53] <ab5tract> and at slides...

[07:57] <pmurias> yes

[07:58] <ab5tract> well, the opcodes part is readable to me as is

[07:59] <ab5tract> though im not sure how the functionality of $r10 and $r11 are determined. unless... by argument?

[07:59] <pmurias> functionality here means?

[08:00] <pmurias> slime/sm0p btw is on the way out, so you don't need to bother with it 

[08:00] <ab5tract> good to know

[08:01] <pmurias> $r10 and $r11 store a SMOP__Object* as all registers

[08:01] <pmurias> ab5tract: did you spend time learning slime/sm0p

[08:01] <pmurias> ?

[08:02] <ab5tract> no just found out about SMOP tonight

[08:03] <ab5tract> [01:28am] ab5tract: but i guess they are right. perl 6 is just a smop.

[08:09] <ab5tract> i've been learning ruby in bleeding-edge ruby land.

[08:09] <ab5tract> even there ruby 1.9 is not a dependency 

[08:10] <ab5tract> :)

[08:10] <pmurias> ruby 1.9 is a problem for you?

[08:10] <ab5tract> not at all

[08:10] <ab5tract> i am excited

[08:10] <ab5tract> i know ruby

[08:11] <ab5tract> i was making a joke about how yarv is for some reason shunned by the web development in ruby community

[08:12] <pmurias> we don't use ruby directly, it's used by STD_red the parser used for elf

[08:13] <ab5tract> i see. ruby grammar is a powerful tool, at least in that its got me excited about programming again.

[08:15] <ab5tract> i expect i will like the two-column variable-namespace-signifier of perl6 quite a bit though

[08:18] <ab5tract> pmurias: nice talking to you. i will be back later to understand more.

[12:23] <moritz_> do you have shell access on that machine?

[12:23] <flob> sure no!

[12:24] <flob> so we need this ? :/

[12:24] <flob> if i have shell access i'll got for an eggdrop

[12:26] <flob> no i want a bot withtout any shell access

[12:26] <moritz_> well, good luck

[20:36] <pmurias> ruoso: got the @tell message?

[20:37] <ruoso> hm... maybe not

[20:37] <lambdabot> ruoso: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[20:37] <ruoso> MARK being?

[20:38] <literal> 22222!

[20:38] <pmurias> MARK calling MARK on all the children and marking the object as live (perhaps using a callback)

[20:39] <ruoso> ah... as the start of a trace gc...

[20:40] <pmurias> yes

[20:40] <ruoso> heh... 

[20:40] <ruoso> that would belong in the smop_lowlevel.h space

[20:41] <ruoso> because only the objects that use the default smop lowlevel will use this gc implementation

[20:41] <ruoso> but wait...

[20:41] <ruoso> i've added RELEASE and REFERENCE to SMOP__ResponderInterface

[20:42] <ruoso> if MARK is a needed infra-structure to support trace gc

[20:42] <ruoso> it should belong in SMOP__ResponderInterface as well

[20:42] <rakudo_svn> r31002 | moritz++ | [rakudo] fixed Failure.ACCEPTS, pmichaud++

[20:42] <ruoso> with no-ops where needed

[20:44] <ruoso> pmurias, does it make sense?

[20:46] <ruoso> pmichaud, about "This Week on Perl 6", I'd be glad to help pointing the news about smop... do you plan to have a wiki or something? or are you planning just to compile news received by mail?

[20:46] <pugs_svn> r22223 | moritz++ | [t/spec] unfudged smartmatch.t a bit for rakudo, +1 new test
