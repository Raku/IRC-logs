[03:01] <lambdabot> mncharity said 4h 10m 26s ago: re reading lines, a cautionary tale - I've squandered a scary amount of life attempting workarounds for pugsbugs. Man months. Given that rakudo is actively developed,

[03:01] <lambdabot> I suggest you try applying a very low threshold to asking "rakudo folks: I need to do X - can you find me a way to do it that works?", and shift to some unblocked aspect of test writing.

[03:03] <Auzon> @tell mncharity Thanks for your insight. I usually don't spend much time on working around bugs, but this one had the potential of a high payoff since it would add a ton of regex tests in one spot, making it easy to identify what is tested.

[15:26] <moritz_> Auzon: I already use Vim as external syntax hilighter

[15:26] <moritz_> Text::VimColor IIRc

[15:27] <Auzon> I meant having Vim use a STD.pm-backed highlighter.

[15:27] <moritz_> oh that. Dunno

[15:27] <TimToady> @@tell pmurias yes, that is how you switch to a different language; the "interesting" parts relate to derivation and optimization

[15:27] <TimToady> Auzon: it would currently be quite slow...

[15:28] <TimToady> still takes 2 minutes to parse STD.pm even with the cache loaded

[15:29] <Auzon> Yeah, that's a bit long, but I imagine you haven't done any optimizations, and if you run it on Rakudo or something like that, it'd be fast enough

[15:29] <TimToady> a robust, fast dfa engine will help a lot

[15:29] <moritz_> maybe you can steal the one from TCL?

[20:04] <moritz_> Auzon++ # systematic tests

[20:12] <Auzon> I would've completed the rest, but I need to write up my report and take a break.

[20:13] <moritz_> speaking of reporting... I'll be offline during the next two weeks, roughly

[20:13] <moritz_> (vacations, YaY)

[20:14] <Auzon> I'm almost thinking that it'd make more sense to divide up that 535 test file (or otherwise organize them) instead of moving it as-is

[20:14] <moritz_> why? to get a better idea for what's actually covered?

[20:15] <Auzon> Yes, and some things require external code (like using variables or calling subroutines in it)

[20:16] <[particle]1> auzon: have you looked at parrot's pge tests?

[20:16] *** [particle]1 is now known as [particle]

[20:16] <[particle]> there are many tests for s05-related syntax

[20:16] <[particle]> split into multiple files

[20:17] <Auzon> [particle]: No, I have not. Would it make sense to put them into the Pugs repo?

[20:18] <moritz_> t/compilers/pge/perl6regex/

[20:19] <Auzon> This looks a lot like the t/regex/p6regex/regex_tests file in Pugs

[20:20] <Auzon> but it's a whole lot longer, so presumably more comprehensive. Is it maintained?

[20:20] <moritz_> I'm quite sure, it's run as part of the ordinary parrot test suite

[20:21] <moritz_> the question is more "is the syntax still identical to Perl 6?"

[20:22] <[particle]> yes, it's maintained

[20:22] <[particle]> if it's out of date (perhaps \d is) then it must be updated

[20:22] <Auzon> Is it meant to be identical to S05 syntax?

[20:23] <[particle]> yes, everything under perl6regex/

[20:23] <moritz_> Auzon: yes, but PGE traditionally updates slower than S05 ;-)

[20:24] <[particle]> these tests were created (mainly by me) long before it was possible to write in perl 6

[20:24] <Auzon> If I see any changes, I should send patches to rakudobug, correct?

[20:25] <[particle]> no, those are parrot tests, so parrotbug

[20:25] <Auzon> OK, sounds good.

[20:25] <[particle]> if you wish to use them for perl 6 (put them in the spectest suite) then they should be copied there

[20:26] <pugs_svn> r21600 | fglock++ | [v6.pm] added bare sigils

[20:26] <[particle]> for example, parrot has p5regex tests copied from perl 5.9.4

[20:40] <Auzon> Is it accurate to say that PGE is based on Perl 6 rules?

[20:40] <moritz_> I'd say it implements Perl 6 rules

[20:41] <moritz_> but isn't 100% up-to-date

[20:42] <Auzon> The way that the PGE tests are organized was something I had in mind when I mentioned splitting up the t/regex/p6regex/regex_tests file earlier.
