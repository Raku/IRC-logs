[11:27] <pugs_svnbot> r20092 | ruoso++ | [smop] updating the sm0p canonical grammar (not the KP6 implementation), so maybe it can be tested with other implementation.

[11:27] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/20092

[11:27] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 20092 - Pugs - Trac

[11:28] <ruoso> [particle], sm0p has been implemented in KP6 to make the preprocessing of the sm0p blocks... but I'm facing some troubles with KP6 and I wonder if nqp or rakudo already support writing that grammar..

[11:28] <lambdabot> ruoso: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[11:32] <ruoso> [particle], the grammar is http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/smop/sm0p/Grammar.pm

[14:25] <ruoso> [particle], even if the closures are simply string substitution?

[14:27] <[particle1> we don't have a return statement yet

[14:27] <[particle1> hrmm, perhaps implicit return of last statement would be good enough

[14:27] <ruoso> hmm... I'm not sure if that's ok for that matter

[14:27] <ruoso> "make" must set the return to be that instead of the match

[14:28] <ruoso> in theory, implicit return don't change the return value of the match

[14:28] <[particle1> we do have a make statement, just not return

[14:28] <ruoso> I'm only using 'make'

[14:28] <ruoso> (except for one place I'm misusing return

[14:28] <ruoso> )

[14:29] <[particle1> right :)

[14:30] * ruoso fixed that

[14:30] <[particle]> aha

[14:30] <pugs_svnbot> r20093 | ruoso++ | [smop] sm0p/Grammar.pm use make instead of return...

[14:30] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/20093

[14:30] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 20093 - Pugs - Trac

[14:32] <ruoso> [particle], so, what changes would be needed to get the Grammar working in nqp or rakudo?

[14:32] <ruoso> if you like, you can svn cp Grammar.pm Rakudosm0p.p6 and make the changes ;)

[14:32] <[particle]> simple things, s/<identifier>/<ident>/g

[14:33] <[particle]> i wonder, can you support <.ws> ?

[14:33] <[particle]> there's no reason to capture the whitespace

[14:33] <ruoso> but you do realise that identifier in my grammar is not Perl 6 identifier....

[14:33] <ruoso> it's sm0p identifier

[14:33] <[particle]> ah, sorry

[14:33] <ruoso> the grammar is in theory a completely self-contained string substitution

[14:34] <[particle]> yes, now i see

[14:34] <[particle]> ok, i get it, no inheriting other grammars

[14:34] <ruoso> a macro expander

[14:34] <[particle]> fine, it should work

[14:34] <ruoso> (except for \d, \s and the like...)

[14:34] <[particle]> sure

[14:35] <ruoso> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/smop/sm0p/sample.sm0p

[14:35] <ruoso> that's a sample sm0p code...

[14:35] <[particle]> i'd like to have a sm0p compiler step, so you can do source -> parse -> sm0p

[14:35] <ruoso> ahm?

[14:36] <[particle]> sorry, a PCT::HllCompiler step

[14:36] <ruoso> ok... that's probably what I'm calling s1p

[14:36] <ruoso> which compiles Perl 6 code to a set of sm0p blocks

[14:36] <ruoso> http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?smop_s1p_language

[14:36] <lambdabot> Title: SMOP s1p Language / Perl 6

[14:37] <ruoso> see the example in the end 

[14:37] <ruoso> and the sm0p grammar should turn the sm0p blocks into bare C code...

[14:37] <ruoso> (actually a single really long line)

[14:38] <ruoso> (for each block)

[14:38] <ruoso> btw... s1p is not implemented yet...

[14:38] <ruoso> and I would really appreciate any implementation :)

[14:39] *** Zygo joined
[14:42] <[particle]> yes, i see that, even from timtoady :)

[14:42] <ruoso> heh

[14:45] <ruoso> [particle], but getting back to the sm0p grammar... do you think it would just work? or would it need adjustments?

[14:51] <[particle]> yes, i think it'll work

[14:51] <[particle]> do you have a recent parrot trunk?

[14:52] * ruoso updatign right now

[14:53] * ruoso running make...

[14:54] <[particle]> tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl

[14:55] <ruoso> but, do I need to create a language for that?

[14:56] <ruoso> Can't I just run it as a standalone script (which in fact the Grammar.pm file already is)

[14:56] <ruoso> ?

[14:57] <[particle]> ah, you mean as a perl 6 script

[14:58] <[particle]> i'm not sure we've implemented 'grammar' yet

[14:59] <ruoso> I mean... I just need to run that grammar taking some input and producing some output

[14:59] <ruoso> using whatever means needed.

[14:59] <[particle]> sure, ok. i'm rebuilding parrot now

[14:59] <[particle]> first thing to do would be to make sure the file parses

[15:00] <ruoso> Ok, should I try it with rakudo or nqp?

[15:01] <[particle]> cd languages/perl6 && make perl6 && perl6 --target=parse <filename>

[15:04] <ruoso> [particle], hmmm... it stopped at line 3... 

[15:05] <ruoso> it doesn't seems to recognize grammar and token

[15:29] * ruoso wonders if pugs can be compiled with 6.6.1-2

[15:29] <ruoso> [particle], could you try it with ';' instead?

[15:29] <[particle]> c:\usr\local\parrot\clean\languages\perl6>..\..\parrot perl6.pbc -e "grammar sm0p { token frame { <ws> <identifier> <ws> '=' <ws> 'q:sm0p' <ws> '{' <ws> <nodes> <ws> '}' <ws> ';' } }; say 1;"

[15:29] <[particle]> 1

[15:31] <[particle]> ok, here's one difference

[15:31] <[particle]> rakudo requires {{ }} around closures

[15:32] <[particle]> rather than { }

[15:32] <ruoso> hmm

[15:32] <[particle]> it's not to spec

[15:33] <ruoso> hmm... I can't get the closure to be parsed... even with the double {

[15:34] <ruoso> h,,

[15:34] <ruoso> ok... {{ without spaces...

[15:34] <ruoso> it parsed

[15:34] <[particle]>     {{ make $<identifier> ~

[15:34] <[particle]> parses fine here

[15:35] *** alester joined
[15:35] <ruoso> yeah... I think i'm getting closer...

[15:41] <ruoso> [particle], nice... rakudo parses the grammar

[15:41] <pugs_svnbot> r20094 | ruoso++ | [smop] adding a rakudo implementation of the sm0p grammar... it parses already... but fails when trying to execute...

[15:42] <ruoso> [particle], it still fails when trying to execute...

[15:42] <[particle]> yep, probably fails when running 'module main'

[15:42] <ruoso> should I try to remove the "module" thing entirely?

[15:43] <[particle]> give it a shot

[15:43] <ruoso> well it didn't express a linked-list corruption anymore

[15:43] <[particle]> c:\usr\local\parrot\clean\languages\perl6>..\..\parrot perl6.pbc -e "module main

[15:43] <[particle]>  { say 1 }"

[15:43] <ruoso> it now just failed

[15:43] <ruoso> Null PMC access in invoke()

[15:43] <[particle]> yep, i see that

[15:44] <[particle]> i'm trying to track it down

[15:44] <[particle]> funny, --target=pir isn't working

[15:44] <[particle]> hrmm

[15:44] <ruoso> I need to go to the doctor now... I should be back in a couple hours or so...

[15:45] <[particle]> ~~

[15:46] <ruoso> ah... how can I call the match then

[21:57] <TimToady> I was just at a concurrency summit on friday, so that will help.  well, not the anemia...

[21:58] <TimToady> which is consistent with B12 deficiency, but could also have other reasons

[21:59] <TimToady> (I'm at risk for B12 deficiency in any case, since I am missing part of my stomach...)

[22:00] <TimToady> ought to have occurred to me sooner, but hypoxia makes one stupid...

[22:00] <[particle]> monthly injections are an easy cure for that

[22:00] <TimToady> yeah, regardless of the actual mechanism

[22:01] <TimToady> but could be internal bleeding too, which I also have a history of, so we'll see...

[22:41] <lichtkind> is there anywhere a current precompiled parrot?

[22:41] <lichtkind> for win32

[22:47] <buchetc> do you already have checked http://sourceforge.net/projects/parrotwin32/

[22:54] <lichtkind> buchetc: no thanks

[22:55] <lichtkind> its great

[22:58] <lichtkind> buchetc: whats your interest in perl6 ?

[23:03] <buchetc> lichtkind: I love perl :-) 

[23:04] <lichtkind> buchetc: thats always a very god reason :)

[23:04] <buchetc> perl6 will be a big step for modern programming languages

[23:04] <lichtkind> ähm good

[23:04] <lichtkind> buchetc: yeah there is no languange nearly as shiny as perl 6

[23:05] <lichtkind> perl 5 is on 5 or 6 for me

[23:05] <lichtkind> buchetc:  and your also just a lurker or?

[23:06] <buchetc> lichtkind: lurker??

[23:06] <lichtkind> buchetc: someone who just looks

[23:08] <lichtkind> or i ask the other way would you ne interested to help out with an perl 6 tutorial

[23:09] <buchetc> lichtkind: Tutorials are not my favourite task :/. I currently work at S17 and concurrency issues for perl6

[23:11] <lichtkind> ah you are that i heard it on channel today

[23:13] <lichtkind> ther perl6.exe doesnt seems to work

[23:13] <lichtkind> gives a shitload on error for an simple say statement

[23:15] <buchetc> bad news. I've had build pugs yesterday at win32. I'll try it tomorrow for parrot and let you know

[23:15] <buchetc> at home I've had no win running

[23:16] <buchetc> s/had//
