[02:14] <mncharity> and twice used workarounds, rather than prompting debugging of the parser. :/   but, progress.  hopefully have an IR tree in elf_b (p6) soon, then a similar exercise to this one to get emitting working.

[02:16] <mncharity> if anyone wanted to look at elf_a_create.pl and elf_a_src/util.pl's unindent, and make something like it actually produce a properly indented elf_a_src/ast_handlers.pl, well, I'm not sure if it really matters, but it's ugly.

[02:22] <mncharity> elf_b_src/ast_handlers.pl is not (yet?) checked in, unlike it's elf_a counterpart.  ./elf_b_create.pl writes it.

[16:24] <obra> I need a quick braindump for the historical record. I haven't managed to find an exhaustive list of aborted Perl 6 implementation efforts

[16:25] <obra> Anyone willing to fill out, http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_implementations please go right ahead

[16:25] <lambdabot> Title: Perl 6 implementations / Perl 6, http://tinyurl.com/34fg4j

[16:25] <obra> anyone not willing to fill it out, spew at me and I'll update

[16:26] <PerlJam> obra: there haven't been that many

[16:26] <PerlJam> topaz circa 1998

[16:26] <obra> PerlJam: topaz is already there ;)

[16:26] <obra> I recall that simon did some work on one

[16:26] <PerlJam> there was a perl6-on-perl5 that didn't go anywhere

[16:27] <PerlJam> simon did a proof-of-concept thing

[16:27] <PerlJam> it wasn't an attempt to get a perl 6

[16:27] <obra> whose 6-on-5?

[16:27] <PerlJam> obra: dunno.  It was short lived :)

[16:28] <PerlJam> obra: do you consider pugs as aborted?  :)

[16:28] *** justatheory left
[16:28] <obra> So, there's "maintained" and there's "historical"

[16:28] <obra> Pugs is certainly hovering between the two

[16:29] <ruoso> I'd call them /in development/

[16:30] <obra> I don't actually care about labels. Commit logs speak louder than labels

[16:30] <obra> Mostly, I'm looking to help TPF get together a list of all the attempts that, say, to more than 100loc

[16:30] <obra> ..or were written in haskell and got to more than 5loc.

[16:30] <obra> since it's about the same

[16:41] *** [particle1 joined
[16:45] *** wtgee joined
[16:48] <ruoso> obra, and 1000loc if C?

[16:50] <obra> :P

[16:58] <TimToady> 1000 lines of C macros can get pretty dense...  :)

[17:00] <TimToady> and it's really apples to oranges to lump topaz in with anything post mug-throwing

[17:00] <TimToady> topaz was in that sense only an attempt to reimplement Perl 5

[17:00] <TimToady> so shouldn't be tarred with the same brush

[17:00] <rdice> All help is appreciated.   Thanks folks.

[17:01] <TimToady> it should be tarred with a different brush... :)

[17:01] <rdice> <JerryMcGuire>Help me help you!</JerryMcGuire>

[17:01] *** eternaleye joined
[17:05] <diakopter> TimToady: tarred as in tar-and-feather (!) or tarbaby?

[17:05] *** justatheory joined
[17:06] <diakopter> tarbaby - a situation, problem, or the like, that is almost impossible to solve or to break away from.

[17:06] *** justatheory left
[17:06] <TimToady> in any case, it got to feelin' real tarred and quit :)

[17:08] <TimToady> why in tarnation would you want a fast one?

[17:12] *** justatheory left
[17:15] <diakopter> rdice: now I'm curious why TPF wants a list of stalled/active implementations

[17:16] <rdice> I'm trying to do fundraising for p6 and information about what p6 is and what implementation efforts have been put into it so far will be helpful in making a pitch for funding.

[17:18] *** thoughtpolice left
[17:20] <diakopter> obra: there's redsix, a beginning of an implementation on ruby 1.9

[17:20] <slavik> wow

[17:20] * slavik wants to throw coffee mugs now

[17:21] <obra> diakopter: just for the record "stalled vs active" was my description not drice's

[17:21] <obra> s/dr/rd/

[17:21] <[particle1> pugs: stalled; rakudo: active; kp6: stalled; redsix: active;

[17:21] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[*** No such subroutine: "&stalled"␤    at /tmp/Eeqis79sMc line 1, column 1-8␤]

[17:21] <[particle1> oh, bullocks.

[17:21] <obra> heh

[17:22] * ruoso wonders if smop gets into that lsit

[17:22] <[particle1>  smop: stalled? i defer to ruoso

[17:22] <[particle1> i think the reasons for 'stalled' or 'active' are more important than the classification

[17:22] <diakopter> [particle]: bullocks or bollocks?

[17:23] <ruoso> well... I had just took another project that should consume almost all my time

[17:23] <[particle1>  rakudo: active - funding. pugs: stalled - funding. smop: stalled - funding. kp6: stalled - funding. :)

[17:27] <ruoso> one/two months

[17:27] * [particle1 wonders how perl 5 development was funded

[17:27] <[particle1> i realize the model for perl 6 development is quite different

[17:28] <[particle1> but it's before my involvement in perl, and the history interests me

[17:28] * ruoso points that p5 had a considerably smaller requisite set

[17:29] <obra> perl 5 also wasn't a from-scratch redo

[17:29] * diakopter wants to see a list of TPF's grants and their success measures.

[17:29] <obra> it was an evolutionary growth from perl 1.0

[17:30] <obra> er. "it evolved from"

[22:16] <mncharity> particle1, etal, apropos 'redsix active'.  redsix, a ruby 1.9 implementation of p6 (using a grammar copied from pugs), last saw active development in early 2006.  "stalled" seems the better description.  it occasionally gets moths brushed off.

[22:17] <mncharity> some ideas from it went into a ruby kp6 backend, best characterized as abandoned and dead.

[22:18] *** cmarcelo left
[22:19] <mncharity> if elf achieves a usable bootstrap, STD development prospers, and p6 begins rolling along briskly again, another ruby backend might get done, as it seems to me an easy and fruitful runtime target, but its connection to redsix would be tenuous.

[22:22] <mncharity> re tenuous, well, "inspired by", rather than any sharing of code.  some sharing of ideas.
