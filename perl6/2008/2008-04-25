[02:02] <mncharity> TimToady: re STD.pm, it looks like STD.pm is missing ::: :: : \s \S and regex_backslash on metasyntactic glyphs.  fyi.

[02:39] <mncharity> ﻿TimToady: re STD.pm regex, the parrot tests assume :s is a valid regex_mod_internal.  is it?  are all the other external modifiers also valid internal?

[02:43] *** Bzek joined
[02:50] *** yewenbin joined
[02:58] <mncharity> TimToady: re STD.pm, is regex_assertion:variable intended to parse '$3=(.)' ?  if so, how?  (given that EXPR doesn't like '.')  I can certainly kludge around it, but just what to make sure I'm not missing the point.

[03:00] <mncharity> There's also  regex_metachar:var , but that's only taking a ':=' rather than a '='.

[03:00] *** rindolf joined
[03:02] <mncharity> actually, it looks like it can't be a regex_assertion.  so... ﻿it looks like regex_metachar:var has a typo - ':=' used instead of '='?

[03:44] <mncharity> TimToady: in regex_assertion:ident , should that be <regex> instead of <EXPR...>?  to parse '<before \w*?etc>'

[04:28] *** Psyche^ joined
[04:28] <mncharity> thanks :)

[04:30] <TimToady> I'll have to look at the other things tomorrow

[04:32] <mncharity> np.  most are just fyis.

[04:33] <mncharity> regex_metachar:sym<$> perhaps needs an alternative to the <before, so it can match at eos.

[04:40] *** Patterner left
[04:40] *** Psyche^ is now known as Patterner

[04:40] <mncharity> re ﻿regex_assertion:ident, it looks like more than <regex> is needed, so <alpha-[x]> works.  perhaps <regex> | <cclass_elem>+.

[04:54] <mncharity> There's an regex_assertion:sym<?> and <!>, but it seems <.> is missing.  ie, token regex_assertion:sym<.> { <sym> <regex_assertion> }

[05:00] *** iblechbot joined
[05:02] *** yewenbin joined
[05:03] <mncharity> hmm.  but there's already a  token regex_assertion:sym<.> { <sym> }, so I'm puzzled.

[05:05] *** justatheory joined
[05:07] <PerlJam> mncharity: I'm sort of writing a "perl 6 news" article for TPR.  Is there anything you can tell me about your work so that I can include it in the news?  If you write a paragraph or so and mail it to [email@hidden.address] that would be great.

[05:08] *** justatheory left
[05:17] <PerlJam> TimToady: you too.  If you have anything news-worthy, send it to [email@hidden.address] 

[05:17] <mncharity> regex_metachar:sym<$> might want to include '}' as yet another <before> clause.

[05:17] <PerlJam> otherwise, I'm just rehashing the perl6 design minutes and other perl6 stuff I find 

[05:18] <mncharity> ﻿PerlJam: hi, re ﻿"perl 6 news" article for TPR, target audience?  objective?  example?

[05:18] <mncharity> s/example/link to existing one/

[05:19] <PerlJam> mncharity: I don't know yet, that's why I said "sort of".  There is no article yet.  If something comes together before the deadline for TPR, I'm going with it

[05:19] <mncharity> :)

[05:20] <PerlJam> Since it'll be the first perl 6 news for TPR (to my knowledge), I'll give a brief recap of what's happened since 2000 or so and then focus on what's happened in the last few months.

[05:20] <PerlJam> (that's my plan anyway)

[05:21] <mncharity> um... so is the 'never been done before' a general TPR news article, or EOF  ah, ok

[05:21] <mncharity> ﻿"brief recap of what's happened since 2000", lol

[05:21] <PerlJam> :-)

[05:22] *** gbacon left
[05:24] <PerlJam> one of my side goals is to let people know that there are other perl 6 implementations out there other than pugs

[05:24] <PerlJam> (I'm not unbiased news :)

[05:25] <mncharity> meaning rakudo?  or others?

[05:26] <PerlJam> any and all implementations if I can

[05:26] <PerlJam> especially those that have active participants

[05:27] <PerlJam> If I don't get much input though, it'll become something like "Rakudo News"

[05:28] *** alanhaggai left
[05:28] <mncharity> ﻿active ﻿participant*s*, plural, probably means only rakudo (unless maintenance is included, in which case pugs might borderline qualify).

[05:28] <mncharity> elf had two participants for a week or two, but the last week has had zero.

[05:29] <PerlJam> well, then think of this as an opportunity to invite others

[05:29] <mncharity> :(

[05:29] <mncharity> :)

[05:30] *** rindolf left
[05:30] <PerlJam> anyway, tell me what elf is (via email).  tell me where it's going.  tell me something newsworthy  :)

[05:31] *** alanhaggai joined
[05:31] *** Bzek left
[05:32] <mncharity> hmm.  Perl 6 has had such an extreme vaporware problem, I'm very reluctant to raise elf visibility outside a narrow p6 developer community until it is quite mature.  basically pugs-like in capability, or at least unambiguously moving towards it rapidly.

[05:34] <PerlJam> perl6 has only had a vaporware problem because too many people didn't understand the scope of work required. Now that the scope is better known (even by the naysayers), it's enough (IMHO) to tell people "we're working on it and here's how"

[05:44] <mncharity> hmm.  well, sounds interesting.  my inclination is to leave elf mention for a later time.

[05:45] <PerlJam> okay, maybe next issue (3 months or so) if I can get myself to write another perl 6 news

[05:45] <PerlJam> (if I can get myself to finish this one! :-)

[05:47] <mncharity> re ﻿3 months, sounds plausible.  though the ﻿newsworthy question turned out interesting - by line and character count, elf is ~5% the size of the pugs test suite.

[05:47] <mncharity> parser and batteries not included

[05:58] <mncharity> obra: re "10-line bootstrap" thought from this afternoon, looks like elf is 5-6 kloc.  :)   about half ruby parser and half p6 backend.  with half the p6 being metaprogrammed repetitive node code, and half being handwritten.

[05:59] *** gbacon joined
[06:03] <mncharity> re write/finish... well, sounds like coverage and objectives are still a bit fuzzy?  perhaps explore them further, and/or find someone to wear and "editor hat".

[06:11] <mncharity> TimToady: parrot has a test regex [ if :  not | ify ] which is supposed to match "verify".  perhaps just because it's late, I'm unclear on how that ':' gets parsed.  ??

[06:13] <mncharity> also puzzled by /[ ab | abc ]: de/

[06:14] <PerlJam> I'd guess that : has higher precedence than | if that regex matches verify.

[06:14] <PerlJam> Though that doesn't sit right with my brain right now for some reason.

[06:15] <PerlJam> mncharity: what puzzles you about the second one?

[06:20] <mncharity> currently STD.pm seems to only accept ':' after a regex_quantifier (? * + **).

[06:20] <mncharity> but perhaps I'm just missing it.  getting late.

[06:24] *** Zaba left
[06:26] <mncharity> TimToady: parrot's ./t/compilers/pge/perl6regex/rx_metachars has a line 'b |  | d                abc             n       null pattern invalid'.  is '﻿b |  | d' really a valid regex?  STD and the Snn definition of ** suggests otherwise...

[06:29] <mncharity> ﻿TimToady: as a regex_mod_internal, is :i[1] et all allowed, or must it be :i(1).

[06:29] <mncharity> *et al

[12:16] <pmurias> how much perl6 could be parsed by a grammar only using a T(DFA)?

[12:18] <moritz_> not much

[12:18] <moritz_> a DFA doesn't do nesting

[12:18] <moritz_> you can't even parse an arithmetic expression with a DFA

[12:18] <moritz_> I assume TDFA = tagged DFA?

[12:19] <pmurias> moritz_: tagged DFA = TDFA yes

[12:21] <pmurias> yes, i would be able to only parse a regular language :(
