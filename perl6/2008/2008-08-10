[18:33] *** iblechbot joined
[18:33] <p6eval> rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[1.84467e+19␤]

[18:33] <p6eval> rakudo 29834: RESULT[1.84467e+19]

[18:39] <pmurias> s1n: %s.* was what I was looking for

[18:42] <s1n> pmurias: there's a number of ways really, if it's c++ you should really use setw or something similar

[18:43] <s1n> if it's c, then you can use truncated strings, or the count specifier with a string

[18:44] <pmurias> it's smop so it's C, truncated strings means?

[18:44] <pugs_svn> r21877 | s1n++ | [spec] failing regression test due to division inaccuracy

[18:46] <pmurias> i'm using a length field in our string object

[18:48] *** iblechbot_ left
[18:48] <s1n> what are you doing with the length field? got an example?

[18:50] <pmurias> sure, printf("%s.*",len,str);

[18:51] <pmurias> walk&

[18:52] <s1n> pmurias: yeah, that's more or less the runtime version of the length specifier (like how i showed the example with the 5 in it)

[18:53] *** iblechbot_ joined
[18:53] <s1n> err well, it could be compile time (i don't want to be misleading), but you get the idea, your use is perfectly valid

[18:55] <pmurias> s1n: len and str are variables not just placeholders

[18:55] <pmurias> it could be "%*c" as well

[18:58] *** iblechbot left
[19:00] <s1n> Auzon: did you finish the gsoc work?

[19:00] <Auzon> I have one more week of it.

[19:00] *** kanru left
[19:01] <Auzon> So my project will be finished then (even though the test suite work will continue, and I'm likely to be around to lend an hour here and there)

[19:01] <pmurias> walk&

[19:05] <s1n> Auzon: well it's good to see the test suite moving forward, thanks for the work :)

[19:07] <Auzon> It's been fun, and a great learning experience too.

[19:09] *** axyjo left
[19:10] <s1n> anyone have a link to the web-based spec (the one hosted on feather with the collapsable spec tests)?

[19:11] <Auzon> http://perlcabal.org/syn/ <-- that?

[19:11] <lambdabot> Title: Official Perl 6 Documentation

[19:11] <s1n> Auzon: yeah, the cabal, thanks

[19:12] *** iblechbot joined
[19:13] <s1n> bah, nothing on either readline or eof

[19:19] <Auzon> t/spec/S16-filehandles/io.t mentions readline

[19:19] <Auzon> t/spec/S16-io/basic-open.t mentions eof

[19:20] <s1n> yeah, it doesn't say what the return is when an eof is reached and whether a final readline is needed to detect the eof or it sets the eof after the last valid read

[19:21] <s1n> right now, it looks like a final readline with undef returned is needed to detect it

[19:22] <s1n> err well, it looks like it doesn't actually return undef

[19:24] <Auzon> Yeah, .eof looks underspecced

[19:24] <s1n> hmmm

[19:25] <Auzon> I imagine it should return Bool::True after the final line so you can use it as: until $fh.eof {.say}

[19:25] <Auzon> hm, well, imagine that I put a $fh.readline in there too.

[19:25] *** iblechbot_ left
[19:26] <s1n> is there a good way to get a better print of a scalar (like how the evalbot does)?

[19:28] <Auzon> Try .perl

[19:30] *** iblechbot_ joined
[19:32] <s1n> do you see where the =$filehandle operator is?

[19:33] <s1n> nm, s03

[19:36] <Auzon> =$foo is generic iteration so you can use it on Ranges and such

[19:36] <s1n> yeah i read that

[19:37] <Auzon> You can also .shift and .pop iterators, which looks like a lot of fun on filehandles.

[19:37] <s1n> it looks like =$foo on filehandles isn't working

[19:38] *** Schwern joined
[19:39] <s1n> it looks like '@foo = =$bar' is returning the IOIterator, according to the spec, it doesn't look like it works

[19:40] <Auzon> Jonathan++ worked on this recently, so let me dig up his notes on it

[19:41] <Auzon> Ah, right, it's broken until Rakudo has lazy lists

[19:42] <s1n> ahh

[19:42] <s1n> got a link to his notes?

[19:42] <pmurias> ruoso: what do you think i should have in the SMOP talk, a glimps of the metamodel,the smop RI stuff, m0ld?

[19:42] <Auzon> http://www.rakudo.org/2008/08/fixing-bugs-and-looking-at-whe.html

[19:42] <lambdabot> Title: Fixing bugs, and looking at where we're at - Rakudo.org

[19:44] <s1n> Auzon: okay, that clears up that mess, thanks, i hadn't read his blog in a little while (maybe i should catch up)

[19:44] *** iblechbot left
[19:44] <Auzon> Yeah, I subscribe to several P6 feeds to keep on top of things. Attending Parrotsketch is also informative, though it also has non-Rakudo stuff.

[19:45] *** barney left
[19:45] <s1n> i do too but i have been falling behind lately

[19:45] <s1n> lots of non-technical things going on around here
