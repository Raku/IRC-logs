[10:39] <riffraff> hi everyone

[10:40] <rakudo_svn> r33548 | moritz++ | [rakudo] remove debugging output. Closes RT #61078. ihrd++

[10:42] <riffraff> I think I found a problem in the parser  generated from parrot/tools/dev/mk_language_shell

[10:42] <riffraff> admittedly, it is a stub so it should not be feature complete

[10:43] <riffraff> but I guess that the rules to match integers and string literals should be "token"

[10:43] <riffraff> otherwise, by default, say "ok", " ", "foo" swallows the whitespace declaration

[10:46] <riffraff> if someone can confirm I'm not dumb I'll submit a patch :) 

[10:47] *** pmurias joined
[10:58] <moritz_> riffraff: confirmed

[11:14] <riffraff> oh thrre is a trac?

[11:15] *** DemoFreak joined
[11:16] <riffraff> argh, the subject got cut

[11:17] <riffraff> I'm too stupid.

[11:17] <thei0s> it is always good to click preview :)

[11:19] <riffraff> but gmail does not have preview :)

[11:19] <riffraff> I hope they'll soon implement something that reads your subject and tells you if it makes sense or not and warn you "oh, i guessyou missed something". It may require sufficiently advanced magic, but it would be really useful

[11:21] <thei0s> hm, not magic, sufficiently complex grammar :)

[11:22] <riffraff> I thought it as the same thing

[11:22] <riffraff> ;)

[11:23] <riffraff> (it seems impossible to change the ticket's subject once posted via email.. I'll live with it it seems)

[11:23] <riffraff> btw: parrot's default REPL routine lacks, well, the "P" part?

[11:25] *** zamolxes joined
[11:26] <riffraff> the 'interactive' sub in HLLCompiler.pir seems to call '_dumper'($P0, target) if target is defined

[11:28] <riffraff> but, I do not understand what target is , nor dumper. Or anyway, why it's not set to some default so that for example if I run perl6 in ineractive mode i can see that 1+1 = 2 withouth prefixing everything with "say"

[21:34] <moritz_> re

[21:35] <masak> 're' is Latin for 'thing, affair'

[21:35] <masak> that's why reply-mails are prefixed "Re: "

[21:35] <slavik> I thought re meant regarding

[21:36] <masak> slavik: many people think that.

[21:36] <slavik> moritz_: how do I do web dev with perl6?

[21:36] <masak> slavik: is there anything I can help you with?

[21:36] <slavik> is it done with here-docs like with perl5?

[21:36] <slavik> masak: I want to setup mod_perl6 and a test page in perl6 :)

[21:37] <masak> slavik: well, heredocs aren't implemented in Rakudo yet.

[21:37] <masak> slavik: have you taken a look at November wiki?

[21:37] <slavik> masak: I've seen the wiki itself, but not the code

[21:37] <masak> it's not using mod_perl6 yet, but soon

[21:37] <slavik> oh

[21:37] <slavik> masak: what does it use? fastcgi?

[21:37] <masak> slavik: well, in the code is the answer to how you _can_ do web dev in Perl 6, at least. :)

[21:38] <masak> slavik: right now, nothing.

[21:38] <slavik> masak: so, how does november work?

[21:38] <masak> slavik: read from input, write to output.

[21:38] <slavik> masak: but how does apache know to call rakudo for perl6 pages?

[21:38] <masak> you have to set that up manually right now with apache.

[21:39] <masak> it calls a script in the p6w/ dir

[21:39] <masak> and the script executes Rakudo

[21:39] <masak> a shell script

[21:39] <slavik> I see

[21:39] <slavik> brb, but keep typing info :)

[21:39] <masak> mod_perl6 will improve on that state of affairs

[21:40] <masak> slavik: well, check out http://github.com/viklund/november/tree/master/p6w/wiki.sh.in

[21:40] <masak> that's basically it.

[21:45] <pmurias> masak: i thought a bare re refered to the re-  prefix

[21:46] <masak> pmurias: I have not seen such a case.

[21:46] <masak> in emails, it does mean the Latin word.

[21:46] <slavik> err, perl6.pbc? is that rakudo?

[21:46] <masak> slavik: it is.

[21:47] <slavik> masak: so if I have /usr/local/bin/perl6, I can just make a handler for p6 to call perl6 on it, right?

[21:47] <slavik> like, in terminal I can do: perl6 code.p6

[21:47] <pmurias> masak: i meant a bare re in irc

[21:47] <masak> pmurias: that might be. I'm not very down with IRC lingo.

[21:48] <masak> slavik: sure, I guess. we chose this method to be as general as possible.

[21:48] <pmurias> neither am i

[21:48] <slavik> k

[21:48] <slavik> now, I need to figure out how to make apache do it :)

[21:50] <masak> I wish I knew more about that part. :) viklund++ did that.

[21:55] <jhorwitz> slavik: very easy to do with mod_perl6

[21:55] <masak> yay! slavik, jhorwitz++ can help you.

[21:58] <slavik> jhorwitz: how do I set up apache to run perl6 code?

[21:58] <slavik> and where can I get mod_perl6?

[21:58] <slavik> and how well does it work?

[21:58] <slavik> and such

[21:58] <jhorwitz> LOL

[22:00] <jhorwitz> first, install parrot and mod_parrot (https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModParrot)

[22:00] <jhorwitz> fyi, i will likely release mod_parrot 0.5 next week

[22:00] <slavik> k

[22:00] <jhorwitz> if mod_parrot's test all pass, mod_perl6 is easy.

[22:01] <slavik> k

[22:01] <jhorwitz> i'll have more detailed docs in the release, but i'm happy to help you along until then.

[22:01] <slavik> k, well, I have parrot and perl6 installed

[22:01] <slavik> so, we got that :)

[22:02] <jhorwitz> and apache and the apache dev environment (includes, apxs, etc.)

[22:02] *** Aisling left
[22:03] *** Aisling joined
[22:03] <slavik> jhorwitz: the dev packages?

[22:04] <jhorwitz> yes

[22:04] <slavik> k

[22:05] <slavik> looks like I'll be leaving soon, jhorwitz, I got a text editor open, let's run down the most basic stuff

[22:05] <slavik> so: indstalled apache and the dev packages. working parrot/perl6

[22:05] <slavik> next?

[22:06] <slavik> checkout mod_parrot?

[22:06] <jhorwitz> check out mod_parrot from subversion

[22:06] <slavik> compile it and such?

[22:06] <jhorwitz> read the README

[22:06] <jhorwitz> yes

[22:06] <jhorwitz> if make test passes all tests, you should be good to go and we can work on mod_perl6

[22:06] <jhorwitz> btw, what OS?

[22:06] <slavik> Linux, of course

[22:06] <slavik> Ubuntu to be specific

[22:07] <slavik> 8.10

[22:07] <jhorwitz> then you should have no problem

[22:07] <jhorwitz> my development platform is debian

[22:07] <slavik> awesome

[22:07] <slavik> the sane apache defaults ;)

[22:07] <jhorwitz> well, i build my own... ;-)

[22:07] <slavik> apache?

[22:07] * jhorwitz trusts no one

[22:07] <jhorwitz> yeah

[22:07] <slavik> heh

[22:07] <slavik> ok

[22:07] <slavik> jhorwitz: should use gentoo then, but anycase

[22:07] <jhorwitz> heh

[22:08] <slavik> so, build mod_parrot ... then what?

[22:08] <jhorwitz> make test

[22:08] <jhorwitz> if ANY tests fail, there's a big problem

[22:08] <slavik> make test && make; ??

[22:08] <jhorwitz> make install

[22:08] <jhorwitz> then make modperl6, which will precompile the mod_perl6 modules

[22:09] <slavik> next

[22:09] <masak> @ask TimToady I'm reading S12, where it is specced that dispatch can take place on arrays containing code objects. can the array also contain arrays, and have structural recursion happen?

[22:09] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[22:09] <slavik> k

[22:09] <slavik> next

[22:09] <jhorwitz> that's it -- need to configure it.  there's no installation process for mod_perl6 yet.  i'm ripping it out of mod_parrot after 0.5.

[22:09] <slavik> k

[22:10] <slavik> wait, make modperl6, where will it place mod_perl6?

[22:10] <slavik> or you have to move it manually?

[22:10] <jhorwitz> nowhere -- it's just compiling the .pm files to parrot bytecode

[22:10] <slavik> k

[22:10] <jhorwitz> you can configure apache to load it in place

[22:10] * jhorwitz digs up a config

[22:10] <slavik> awesome

[22:10] <slavik> jhorwitz: also, sample page? ^^

[22:11] <jhorwitz> actually, look in eg/perl6 in mod_parrot

[22:11] <masak> rakudo: my $locator = method { .<here> }; my %h = { here => "foo" }; say %h.$locator

[22:11] <p6eval> rakudo 33575: OUTPUT[get_pmc_keyed() not implemented in class 'Undef'␤current instr.: '_block18' pc 191 (EVAL_15:73)␤]

[22:12] <slavik> ty

[22:12] <slavik> jhorwitz: I'll pm my e-mail to you for the config, ok?

[22:12] <jhorwitz> sounds good

[22:12] <slavik> ty :)

[22:13] <slavik> also, there is a DBI module in perl6 right?

[22:13] <jhorwitz> no

[22:13] <slavik> :(

[22:13] <slavik> so, connecting to a DB is not doable?

[22:13] <jhorwitz> lathos hacked up a DBDI module last week, but nothing official

[22:13] <masak> slavik: there was some NCI work earlier this fall with SQL.

[22:14] <jhorwitz> it's doable, just not via an official interface yet...

[22:14] <masak> slavik: it's somewhere in the Parrot repo.

[22:14] <masak> very early work, IAUI

[22:14] <masak> AIUI

[22:14] <slavik> I see postgres

[22:14] <slavik> masak: how does november do DB lookups and such?

[22:15] <masak> slavik: we're using files right now.

[22:15] <slavik> ok

[22:15] <jhorwitz> slavik: some mod_perl6 configs are in eg/perl6

[22:15] <slavik> k

[22:15] <slavik> hmm, what if there was an external tool thaqt would connect to DB and such?

[22:15] <slavik> could be like: `mysql --runquery "select blah from blah, etc."`

[22:15] <slavik> or something

[22:16] * masak thinks mysql does that

[22:16] <masak> it even outputs XML.

[22:16] <slavik> k

[22:16] <masak> slavik: may I be so bold as to ask what it is you're building? :)

[22:17] <slavik> masak: Wordpress that doesn't suck :P

[22:17] <masak> slavik: ah, a blog engine.

[22:17] <slavik> masak: no

[22:17] <slavik> masak: "article" engine

[22:17] <masak> slavik: and the difference?

[22:17] <slavik> where you don't have "posts and pages" that are different yet stored in the same tables

[22:18] <slavik> basically, something closer to what slashdot is

[22:18] <masak> I see.

[22:18] <masak> slavik: best of luck to you, sir.

[22:18] <masak> slavik: you might want to talk to ihrd eventually. he's planning to do a blog engine.

[22:18] <slavik> masak: on my blog, it is close to what I want, but I want the homepage to display the latest published stuff, like a feed basically

[22:19] *** pmurias left
[22:20] <slavik> also, articles can be children of other articles and such

[22:20] <slavik> so that you can have like howtos and such

[22:20] <slavik> anyway, I'll be back ...

[22:20] <masak> slavik: what would the child-parent relationship imply for articles?

[22:20] <slavik> masak: just hierarchy

[22:20] <masak> ah.

[22:21] <slavik> so you can markup on the current page: print this articles children

[22:21] <slavik> and such

[22:21] <slavik> so you get like a book type thing, where there is a page for a chapter and it includes the sections of that chapter

[22:21] <slavik> masak: look on my "blog" now, it's the Dive into Perl6 tab

[22:21] <slavik> bcacm.org/~slavik

[22:21] <slavik> soemthing like that

[22:21] <slavik> actually, exactly that

[22:22] <masak> http://bcacm.org/~slavik # so I can click on it from the IRC window :)

[22:22] <slavik> heh

[22:22] <slavik> sorry

[22:22] <masak> np

[22:22] <masak> still loading very slowly over here.

[22:22] <masak> I can't see it.

[22:22] <slavik> masak: I even put up my grammar for URLs there :)

[22:22] <slavik> yeah, it does, my college network :(

[22:22] <masak> sounds interesting.

[22:22] <slavik> see if there is a google cache or something

[22:23] <masak> slavik: um. ok.

[22:23] <masak> slavik: you really should consider switching server. I can reach most every other page on the web.

[22:41] <jnthn> Ah, great. You are efficient. :-)

[22:41] <masak> jnthn: hai!

[22:41] <jnthn> OH HAI

[22:42] <masak> (instead of sleeping last night like I should, I typed a lot of things from S12 into Rakudo, trying to find holes. so you have five incoming rakudobugs right now.)

[22:43] <jnthn> Great.

[22:43] * jnthn is trying to get as much of S12 done as possible

[22:43] <masak> also great.

[22:43] <jnthn> There's a LOT in that synopsis.

[22:43] <masak> mhm.

[22:43] <jnthn> So far I've been working on it for the last year. ;-)

[22:44] <masak> 哈哈

[22:44] <jnthn> It was about a year ago when I first started hacking on Rakudo.

[22:44] <jnthn> And it wasn't long before I dug into S12 things.

[22:45] <jnthn> Of course, it's not been a solid year of working on it. But more weeks than not.

[22:45] <masak> aye.

[22:45] <jnthn> (As in, more weeks I've hacked on Rakudo than not...)

[22:45] <jnthn> It's kinda crazy thinking how much has been done, and realizing how much there is left to do...

[22:45] <masak> :)

[22:46] <masak> I must say that it feels amazing to be part of this project, though.

[22:46] <masak> so many things are falling in place these days.

[22:46] <masak> just think when we'll have macros! :O

[22:47] <jnthn> Oh yes, I'm really happy I got involved.

[22:48] <masak> I should hit the sack now, and maybe read some more S12.

[22:49] <jnthn> Reading S12 is one thing I haven't done in bed.

[22:49] <masak> I have serious sleep rythm deviations right now.

[22:50] <masak> so I get a lot of reading in bed done. :/

[22:50] <jnthn> :-|

[22:50] <jnthn> Yeah, I'm not sleeping exactly normal hours.

[22:50] <jnthn> Getting up at 8:30am tomorrow is going to suck.

[22:51] <masak> yes, I'll try to make it to church tomorrow. don't know if I'll succeed.

[22:51] <jnthn> I didn't make it last week, and really want to see my friends there.

[22:51] <jnthn> (Didn't make it last week through having a weekend in the UK)

[22:51] <masak> :/

[22:52] <masak> well, good luck tomorrow then.

[22:52] <masak> that's good night.

[22:52] <jnthn> The c is pronounced as you'd say "ts" in English

[22:52] <jnthn> Yes.

[22:53] <masak> jnthn: yes, I figured :)

[22:53] <jnthn> Slovak pronunciation, the soft sounds aside, is not so bad.

[22:53] <masak> Japan fans:Japanese::masak:slavic languages

[22:54] <jnthn> The morphology and grammar, OTOH, is rather tricky.

[22:54] <masak> jnthn: no dualis, as in Slovenian? :)

[22:54] <jnthn> No, thankfully not those!

[22:55] <masak> :)

[22:55] <jnthn> And no vocative case, as in Czech and Ukrainian.

[22:55] <masak> enough cases to go around anyway, I guess.

[22:55] *** pbuetow joined
[22:55] <jnthn> Yes, six is enough.

[22:55] <masak> which ones? nominative, ack, dat, loc, instr...?

[22:55] <jnthn> Especially when you multiply them out with three genders, with masculine divided into animate and inanimate.

[22:56] <jnthn> genitive too

[22:56] <masak> right, forgot that one.

[22:56] <jnthn> That's the six.

[22:56] <jnthn> Maps closely to Russian.

[22:56] <masak> same as Latin then, except for s/instr/abl/

[22:56] <masak> but those are similar.

[22:56] <jnthn> Apart from no loc, it's called the prepositional, IIRC.

[22:57] <masak> aha

[22:57] <jnthn> Ah, I never did look closely at Latin.

[22:57] <masak> anyhoo, dobru noc.
